The most common operations performed on files or groups of files include creating, opening (e.g. [[file viewer|viewing]], playing, editing or [[computer printer|printing]]), renaming, [[file copying|moving or copying]], [[file deletion|deleting]] and searching for files, as well as modifying [[file attribute]]s, properties and [[file permissions]]. [[Folder (computing)|Folders]] and files may be displayed in a [[tree structure|hierarchical tree]] based on their [[directory structure]]. Some file managers contain features inspired by [[web browser]]s, including forward and back navigational buttons.\n\nSome file managers provide [[computer network|network]] connectivity via [[Communications protocol|protocols]], such as [[File transfer protocol|FTP]], [[Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol|HTTP]], [[Network File System (protocol)|NFS]], [[Server Message Block|SMB]] or [[WebDAV]]. This is achieved by allowing the user to browse for a [[file server]] (connecting and accessing the server's file system like a local file system) or by providing its own full client implementations for file server protocols.\n\n==Directory editors==\nA term that predates the usage of ''file manager'' is ''directory editor''.  An early directory editor, [[Dired|DIRED]], was developed circa 1974 at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab by [[Stan Kugell]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Kugell |first=Stanley G. |title=SAILDART/1974-08 |publisher=[[Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab]] DART (Dump and Restore Technique) Archive |year=1974 |url=https://www.saildart.org/DIRED.SGK%5BUP,DOC%5D1 |accessdate=2014-02-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150903224616/http://www.saildart.org/DIRED.SGK%5BUP%2CDOC%5D1 |archivedate=2015-09-03 |df= }}</ref><ref>[https://www.saildart.org/PHONE.LST%5BP,DOC%5D23 SAILDART Username key for above] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150903224616/http://www.saildart.org/PHONE.LST%5BP%2CDOC%5D23 |date=2015-09-03 }}</ref>\n\nA directory editor was written for [[EXEC 8]] at the University of Maryland, and was available to other users at that time. The term was used by other developers, including [[Jay Lepreau]], who wrote the '''dired''' program in 1980,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/utils/file/managers/dired305.lsm |title=Abstract for dired 3.05}}</ref> which ran on [[BSD]]. This was in turn inspired by an older program with the same name running on [[TOPS-20]]. '''Dired''' inspired other programs, including [[dired]], the editor script (for [[emacs]] and similar editors), and '''ded'''.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://invisible-island.net |title=DED - Directory Editor}}</ref>\n\n==File-list file manager==\n''File-list'' file managers are lesser known and older than orthodox file managers.\n\nOne such file manager is flist, which was introduced sometime before 1980 on the [[Conversational Monitor System]].<ref>{{citation |contribution-url=http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/ibm/share/SHARE_61_Proceedings_Volume_1_Summer_1983/B638%20CMS%20Architecture%20and%20Interactive%20Computing;%20Daney.pdf |contribution=CMS Architecture and Interactive Computing |first=Charles |last=Daney |publisher=SHARE Inc. |title=Proceedings of SHARE 61 |volume=1 |year=1983}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://frs.uconn.edu/cms/index.php?com=flist |title=Discussion of VM/CMS FLIST showing screenshot}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://mitvma.mit.edu/cmshelp.cgi?CMS%20FLIST%20(ALL |title=Textual description of VM/CMS FLIST}}</ref>\nThis is a variant of fulist, which originated before late 1978, according to comments by its author, Theo Alkema.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.garlic.com/~lynn/2001f.html#9 |title=email by Theo Alkema to Lynn Wheeler |date=1978-10-10 |accessdate=2008-01-31}}</ref>\n\nThe flist program provided a list of files in the user's minidisk,<ref name=\"minidisk\">{{cite news|url=https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSB27U_6.2.0/com.ibm.zvm.v620.dmsb4/flist.htm |title=FLIST - IBM}} </ref> and allowed sorting by any file attribute.

Orthodox file managers are one of the longest running families of file managers, preceding [[graphical user interface]]-based types. Developers create applications that duplicate and extend the manager that was introduced by [[PathMinder]] and [[John Socha]]'s famous [[Norton Commander]] for [[DOS]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} The concept dates to the mid-1980s\u2014PathMinder was released in 1984, and Norton Commander version 1.0 was released in 1986. Despite the age of this concept, file managers based on Norton Commander are actively developed, and dozens of implementations exist for DOS, Unix, and Microsoft Windows. [[Nikolai Bezroukov]] publishes his own set of criteria for an OFM standard (version 1.2 dated June 1997).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.softpanorama.org/OFM/Standards/index.shtml |title=OFM standards}}</ref>\n\n===Features===\nAn orthodox file manager typically has three windows. Two of the windows are called panels and are positioned symmetrically at the top of the screen. The third is the command line, which is essentially a minimized command (shell) window that can be expanded to full screen. Only one of the panels is active at a given time. The active panel contains the \"file cursor\". Panels are resizable and can be hidden. Files in the active panel serve as the source of file operations performed by the manager. For example, files can be copied or moved from the active panel to the location represented in the passive panel. This scheme is most effective for systems in which the keyboard is the primary or sole input device. The active panel shows information about the [[current working directory]] and the files that it contains. The passive (inactive) panel shows the content of the same or another directory (the default target for file operations). Users may customize the display of columns that show relevant file information. The active panel and passive panel can be switched (often by pressing the [[tab key]]).\n\nThe following features describe the class of orthodox file managers.\n* They present the user with a two-panel directory view with a command line below. Either panel may be selected to be active; the other becomes passive. The active panel becomes the working area for delete and rename operations, while the passive panel serves as a target for copy and move operations. Panels may be shrunk, exposing the terminal window hidden behind them. Normally, only the last line of the terminal window (the command line) is visible.\n* They provide close integration with an underlying [[Operating System|OS]] shell via [[Command-line interface|command line]], using the associated terminal window that permits viewing the results of executing shell commands entered on the command line (e.g., via Ctrl-O shortcut in Norton Commander).\n* They provide the user with extensive keyboard shortcuts.\n* The file manager frees the user from having to use the mouse.\n* Users can create their own file associations and scripts that are invoked for certain file types and organize these scripts into a hierarchical tree (e.g., as a user script library or user menu).{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}\n* Users can extend the functionality of the manager via a so-called ''User menu'' or ''Start menu'' and extensions menu.\n\nOther common features include:\n* Information on the \"active\" and \"passive\" panels may be used for constructing commands on the command line.  Examples include current file, path to left panel, path to right panel, etc.\n* They provide a built-in viewer for (at least) the most basic file types.\n* They have a built-in editor.  In many cases, the editor can extract certain elements of the panels into the text being edited.\n* Many support virtual file systems ([[Virtual file system|VFS]]) such as viewing compressed archives, or working with files via an FTP connection.\n* They often have the word ''commander'' in the name, after [[Norton Commander]].\n* Path: shows the source/destination location of the directory in use\n* Information about directory size, disk usage and disk name (usually at the bottom of the panels)\n* Panel with information about file name, extension, date and time of creation, last modification, and permissions (attributes).\n* Info panel with the number of files in directory, and the sum of the sizes of selected files.\n* Tabbed interface (usually in GUI file managers)\n* Function keys: F1\u2013F10 have all the same functions under all orthodox file managers. Examples: F5 always copies file(s) from the active to the inactive panel, while F6 moves the file.\n\n====Tabbed panels====\nThe introduction of tabbed panels in some file managers (for example [[Total Commander]]) made it possible to manipulate more than one active and passive directory at a time.\n\n====Portability====\nOrthodox file managers<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.softpanorama.org/OFM/index.shtml |title=Home of the OFM standard}}</ref> are among the most portable file managers.  Examples are available on almost any platform, with both command-line and graphical interfaces. This is unusual among command line managers in that something purporting to be a standard for the interface is published. They are also actively supported by developers. This makes it possible to do the same work on different platforms without much relearning of the interface.\n\n====Dual-pane managers====\nSometimes they are called {{Anchor|dual-pane file manager}}dual-pane managers, a term that is typically used for programs such as the Windows File Explorer (see below). But they have three panes including a command line pane below (or hidden behind) two symmetric panes. Furthermore, most of these programs allow using just one of the two larger panes with the second hidden. Some also add an item to the Context Menu in Windows to \"Open two Explorers, side by side\".\n\nNotable ones include:\n{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Altap Salamander]]\n* [[Commander One]]\n* [[Demos Commander]]\n* [[Directory Opus]]\n* [[DOS Navigator]] (DN) and derivatives\n* [[Double Commander]]\n* [[emelFM2]]\n* [[Far Manager]]\n* [[File Commander]]\n* [[Fman]]\n* [[ForkLift (File Manager)|ForkLift]]\n* [[GNOME Commander]]\n* [[Krusader]]\n* [[Midnight Commander]] (MC)\n* [[muCommander]]\n* [[Norton Commander]] (NC)\n* [[PowerDesk]]\n* [[PathMinder]]\n* [[SE-Explorer]]\n* [[Total Commander]]\n* [[Volkov Commander]] (VC)\n* [[WinSCP]]\n* [[XTree]]\n* [[ZTreeWin]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Navigational file manager==\nA '''navigational file manager''' is a newer type of file manager. Since the advent of [[Graphical user interface|GUIs]], it has become the dominant type of file manager for desktop computers.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nTypically, it has two panes, with the filesystem tree in the left pane and the contents of the current directory in the right pane. For macOS, the [[Miller columns]] view in [[Macintosh Finder|Finder]] (originating in [[NeXTStep]]) is a variation on the navigational file manager theme.{{dubious|filesystem in Finder|date=August 2015}}\n[[File:GNUstep-liveCD.png|thumb|The [[Miller Columns|Miller Column]] browser from [[GNUstep]] is a type of Navigational file manager.]]\n\n===Concepts===\n* The [[window (computing)|window]] displays the location currently being viewed.\n* The location being viewed (the current directory) can be changed by the user by opening directories, pressing a ''back button'', typing a location, or using the additional pane with the navigation tree representing all or part of the filesystem.\n* [[Icon (computing)|Icons]] represent files, programs, and directories.\n\nThe interface in a navigational file manager often resembles a [[web browser]], complete with ''back'' and ''forward'' buttons, and often ''reload'' buttons. Most also contain an address bar into which the file or directory path (or [[URI]]) can be typed.\n\nMost navigational file managers have two panes, the left pane being a tree view of the filesystem. This means that unlike orthodox file managers, the two panes are asymmetrical in their content and use.\n\nSelecting a directory in the Navigation pane on the left designates it as the current directory, displaying its contents in the Contents pane on the right. However, expanding (+) or collapsing (-) a portion of the tree without selecting a directory will not alter the contents of the right pane. The exception to this behavior applies when collapsing a parent of the current directory, in which case the selection is refocused on the collapsed parent directory, thus altering the list in the Contents pane.\n\nThe process of moving from one location to another need not open a new window. Several instances of the file manager can be opened simultaneously and communicate with each other via [[drag-and-drop]] and [[Clipboard (software)|clipboard]] operations, so it is possible to view several directories simultaneously and perform cut-and paste operations between instances.\n\nFile operations are based on drag-and-drop and editor metaphors: users can select and copy files or directories onto the clipboard and then paste them in a different place in the filesystem or even in a different instance of the file manager.\n\nNotable examples of navigational file managers include:\n* [[Directory Opus]]\n* [[Dolphin (file manager)|Dolphin]] in [[KDE Software Compilation|KDE]]\n* [[DOS Shell]] in [[MS-DOS]]/[[PC DOS]]\n* [[File Manager (Windows)|File Manager]] in Windows\n* [[Finder (software)|macOS Finder]]\n* [[Nautilus (file manager)|Nautilus]] in [[GNOME]] (default since v2.30)\n* [[File Explorer]] (Windows Explorer)\n* [[PC Shell]] in [[PC Tools (software)|PC Tools]]\n* [[ViewMAX]] in [[DR DOS]]\n* [[XTree]] / [[ZTreeWin]]\n\n==Spatial file manager==\n[[File:Nautilus-spatial.png|thumb|The [[Nautilus file manager]] had a spatial mode, which was removed with the arrival of GNOME (and with it Nautilus) version 3.x.  Each of these windows displays an open directory.]]\n'''Spatial file managers''' use a spatial [[interface metaphor|metaphor]] to represent [[computer file|files]] and [[directory (file systems)|directories]] as if they were actual physical objects. A spatial file manager imitates the way people interact with physical objects.\n\nSome ideas behind the concept of a spatial file manager are:\n\n# A single [[window (computing)|window]] represents each opened directory\n# Each window is unambiguously and irrevocably tied to a particular directory.\n# Stability: files, directories, and windows go where the user moves them, stay where the user puts them (\"preserve their spatial state\"), and retain all their other \"physical\" characteristics (such as size, shape, color and location).\n# The same item can only be viewed in one window at a time.\n\nAs in navigational file managers, when a directory is opened, the [[icon (computing)|icon]] representing the directory changes\u2014perhaps from an image showing a closed drawer to an opened one, perhaps the directory's icon turns into a silhouette filled with a pattern\u2014and a new window is opened to represent that directory.\n\nExamples of file managers that use a spatial metaphor to some extent include:\n* [[Apple Computer|Apple]]'s [[Macintosh Finder|Finder]] 5 to 9 (In the [[macOS]] Finder the spatial metaphor can still be used in general by enabling Finder's preference \"Always open folders in a new window\" <ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/TA20803 |title=Mac OS X: How to Save a Finder View (Column, Icon, or List) for a Specific Folder or Disk |date=2011-08-05 |accessdate=2012-01-05}}</ref> or on demand by holding the [[command key|command key (\u2318)]] while [[double-click]]ing a folder <ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/TA26510 |title=Mac OS X: How to open another window in the Finder |date=2011-08-05 |accessdate=2012-01-05}}</ref>)\n* [[Konqueror]] has the option to turn into spatial mode\n* [[RISC OS]] Filer\n* [[Amiga]]'s [[AmigaOS|Workbench]]\n* [[GNOME]]'s [[Nautilus file manager|Nautilus]] from version 2.6 (default until 2.29, completely removed in 3.0)\n* [[MATE (desktop environment)|MATE]]'s [[Caja file manager|Caja]] (though the default mode is navigational)\n* [[BeOS]]'s [[OpenTracker|Tracker]]\n* [[Haiku (operating system)|Haiku]]'s [[Haiku Tracker|Tracker]]\n* [[OS/2]]'s [[Workplace Shell]]\n* [[Digital Research]]'s [[Graphical Environment Manager|GEM]] (implemented in Atari TOS and as a somewhat reduced version for PCs)\n* ROX-Filer file manager ([[ROX Desktop]])\n* [[Enlightenment (window manager)|E17]] file manager\n\nDysfunctional spatial file managers:\n* [[Windows Explorer]] in [[Windows 95]] was set as a spatial file manager model by default; because it also worked as a navigational file manager, directories could be opened in multiple windows, which made it fail all the above criteria. Later versions gradually abandoned the spatial model.\n* [[Apple Computer|Apple]]'s [[Macintosh Finder|Finder]] in [[macOS]] was designed with a similar integration of spatial and navigational modes, meaning that the spatial mode did not actually work.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/reviews/os/mac-os-x-10-5.ars/12#divided |title=Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard: the Ars Technica review: The Finder: An application divided against itself |date=2007-10-28 |first=John |last=Siracusa |accessdate=2008-04-20}}</ref>\n\n==3D file managers==\n{{example farm|section|date=September 2013}}\n[[File:FSV-OSX-screenshot.png|thumb|[[File System Visualizer]], one example of a 3D file manager]]\n[[File:Cubix 3D Filer Screenshot.png|thumb|In Cubix, files sharing the same attributes are represented by cubes in a 3D environment.]]\n\nSome projects have attempted to implement a [[3D computer graphics|three-dimensional]] method of displaying files and directory structures. Three-dimensional file browsing has not become popular; the exact implementation tends to differ between projects, and there are no common standards to follow.\n\nExamples of three-dimensional file managers include:\n* [[fsn (file manager)|fsn]], for [[Silicon Graphics]]' [[IRIX]] systems, notably featured prominently in one scene from the film [[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]], as a representation of [[Unix]] systems.\n* [[File System Visualizer]], or fsv, an open-source clone of fsn for modern [[Unix-like]] systems.\n* tdfsb,<ref>[http://www.determinate.net/webdata/seg/tdfsb.html tdfsb]</ref> an open-source 3D file browser, where one enters directories by flying into them (using [[Arrow keys#WASD keys|WASD]]).

When installed on a local server or on a remote server, they allow files and directories located there to be managed and edited, using a web browser, without the need for [[FTP|FTP Access]].\n\nMore advanced, and usually commercially distributed, web-based file management scripts allow the administrator of the file manager to configure secure, individual user accounts, each with individual account permissions. Authorized users have access to documents stored on the server or in their individual user directories anytime, from anywhere, via a web browser.\n\nA web-based file manager can serve as an organization's digital repository. For example, documents, digital media, publishing layouts, and presentations can be stored, managed, and shared between customers, suppliers, and remote workers, or just internally.\n\nWeb-based file managers are becoming increasingly popular due to the rise in popularity of dynamic web [[content management system]]s (CMS) and the need for non-technical website moderators to manage media on their websites powered by these platforms.\n\nAn example is [[net2ftp]], a PHP- and JavaScript-based FTP client.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Batch renaming]]\n*[[Comparison of file managers]]\n*[[Disk space analyzer]]\n*[[Desktop metaphor]]\n*[[Spatial navigation]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{dmoz|Computers/Software/File_Management/File_Managers}}\n*[http://www.softpanorama.org/OFM/Paradigm/Ch03/norton_commander.shtml The Orthodox File Manager (OFM) Paradigm: The History of Development of Norton Commander], by [[Nikolai Bezroukov]], Softpanorama.org, 2009.

The file contents are generally displayed on the [[display device|screen]], or they may be [[computer printer|printed]]. Also, they may be read aloud using [[speech synthesis]].\n\n==Overview==\nFile viewers do not edit files, yet it is common for them to be able to export data in a different [[file format]], or to copy information from the viewed to the system-wide [[clipboard]]. A file viewer is limited-functionality software in the sense that it does not have a capability to create a file, or modify the content of an existing one. Instead, it is used only to display or print the content.\n\nFile viewers have to have sufficient knowledge about the file format to be viewed in order to handle different [[byte order]]s, [[code page]]s or [[newline]] styles.\n\nSome file viewer may be classified as [[filter (Unix)|filter]]s that translate binary files into plain text (one example [[antiword]]). However, depending on the competence of the translating routines, some information may be lost.\n\n[[Image viewer]]s display graphics files onscreen. Most viewers are capable of reading multiple [[graphics file format]]s but some such as [[JPEGview]] are dedicated to a single format. Common image viewer features include [[thumbnail]] preview and creation, and image zooming.\n\nFor more complex or proprietary file formats, file viewers are usually provided by the same companies that make the editing software using those formats. Viewers are usually distributed free of charge, while editors have to be bought. For example, the full version of [[Adobe Acrobat]] can be used to create content for most computer platforms. To ensure that people can access the documents created with Adobe Acrobat, the software publisher created a viewer program, the [[Acrobat Reader]], and made it available for free. [[Microsoft]] also makes viewers for [[Microsoft Word|Word]] and [[Microsoft PowerPoint|PowerPoint]] documents freely available. These viewer applications allow the file format to be readable on all supported operating-systems, free of charge, making the commercial product a more attractive solution.\n\nA [[web browser]] is a type of file viewer, which renders [[HTML]] markup into a human-friendly presentation. Although HTML is stored in plain text files, viewing an HTML file in a browser and in a [[text editor]] produces significantly different results. Web browsers may also be used to view image and multimedia files.\n\n==Streaming media==\nThere are also types of data that are not intended for static display \u2014 these incorporate the [[time]] dimension.

The author presents himself as [[Saint Peter|Peter the Apostle]], and, following Roman Catholic tradition, the epistle has been held to have been written during his time as [[bishop]] of [[diocese of Rome|Rome]] or [[Bishop of Antioch]], though neither title is used in the epistle. The text of the letter states that it was written from [[Babylon]]. The letter is addressed to [[First Epistle of Peter#Audience|various churches]] in [[Early Christianity#Western Anatolia|Asia Minor]] suffering religious persecution.\n\n== Authorship ==\n{{Main article|Authorship of the Petrine epistles}}\nThe authorship of 1 Peter has traditionally been attributed to the Apostle Peter because it bears his name and identifies him as its author (1:1). Although the text identifies Peter as its author, the language, dating, style, and structure of this letter have led many scholars to conclude that it is pseudonymous. Many scholars argue that Peter was not the author of the letter because its writer appears to have had a formal education in rhetoric and philosophy, and an advanced knowledge of the Greek language,<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Achtemeier, Paul. Peter 1 Hermeneia. Fortress Press. 1996</ref> none of which would be usual for a Galilean fisherman.\n\n[[Graham Stanton]] rejects Petrine authorship because 1 Peter was most likely written during the reign of Domitian in AD 81, which is when he believes widespread Christian persecution began, which is long after the death of Peter.<ref>Stanton, Graham. Eerdmans Commentary of the Bible. Wm.B. Eerdmans Publishing Company. 2003.</ref>  However, current scholarship has abandoned the persecution argument because the described persecution within the work does not necessitate a time period outside of the period of Peter.<ref name=\"Williams2012\">{{cite book|author=Travis B.

John Elliot disagrees, suggesting that the notion of Silvanus as secretary or author or drafter of 1 Peter introduces more problems than it solves because the Greek rendition of 5:12 suggests that Silvanus was not the secretary, but the courier/bearer of 1 Peter,<ref>Elliot, John. 1 Peter: Anchor Bible Commentary.

On the other hand, some scholars argue that there is enough evidence to conclude that Peter did, in fact, write 1 Peter.

Ultimately, the authorship of 1 Peter remains contested.\n\n==Audience==\n1 Peter is addressed to the \u201celect resident aliens\u201d scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia. The five areas listed in 1:1 as the geographical location of the first readers were [[Roman province]]s in Asia Minor. The order in which the provinces are listed may reflect the route to be taken by the messenger who delivered the circular letter. The recipients of this letter are referred to in 1:1 as \u201cexiles of the Dispersion.\u201d In 1:17, they are urged to \u201clive in reverent fear during the time of your exile\".<ref name=\"autogenerated2003\">Stanton, Graham.

R. F. Browning. Oxford University Press Inc. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press.

Based on such internal evidence, biblical scholar John Elliott summarizes the addressees\u2019 situation as one marked by undeserved suffering.<ref>Elliott, John. 1 Peter: a new translation with introduction and commentary. Yale University Press. 2000</ref>  Verse ([[1 Peter 3:19|3:19]]), \"[[Spirits in prison]]\", is a continuing theme in Christianity, and one considered by most theologians to be enigmatic and difficult to interpret.<ref>''Christian Monthly Standard'' http://www.christianmonthlystandard.com/index.php/preached-to-the-spirits-in-prison-1-peter-318-20/</ref>\n\nA number of verses in the epistle contain possible clues about the reasons Christians experienced opposition. Exhortations to live blameless lives (2:15; 3:9, 13, 16) may suggest that the Christian addressees were accused of immoral behavior, and exhortations to civil obedience (2:13\u201317) perhaps imply that they were accused of disloyalty to governing powers.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nHowever, scholars differ on the nature of persecution inflicted on the addressees of 1 Peter. Some read the epistle to be describing persecution in the form of social [[discrimination]], while some read them to be official persecution.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Mason|first1=Eric F.|last2=Martin|first2=Troy W.|title=Reading 1\u20132 Peter and Jude : A Resource for Students|date=2014|publisher=Society of Biblical Literature|location=Atlanta, Ga.|isbn=9781589837379|pages=16\u201317}}</ref>\n\n===Social discrimination of Christians===\n\nSome scholars believe that the sufferings the epistle's addressees were experiencing were social in nature, specifically in the form of verbal derision.<ref>Elliott, John. I Peter: a new translation with introduction and commentary. Yale University Press. 2000</ref> Internal evidence for this includes the use of words like \u201cmalign\u201d (2:12; 3:16), and \u201creviled\u201d (4:14). Biblical scholar John Elliott notes that the author explicitly urges the addressees to respect authority (2:13) and even honor the emperor (2:17), strongly suggesting that they were unlikely to be suffering from official Roman persecution. It is significant to him that the author notes that \u201cyour brothers and sisters in all the world are undergoing the same kinds of suffering\u201d (5:9), indicating suffering that is worldwide in scope. Elliott sees this as grounds to reject the idea that the epistle refers to official persecution, because the first worldwide [[Persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire|persecution of Christians]] officially meted by Rome did not occur until the persecution initiated by [[Decius]] in AD 250.\n\n===Official persecution of Christians===\nOn the other hand, scholars who support the official persecution theory take the exhortation to defend one's faith (3:15) as a reference to official court proceedings.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> They believe that these persecutions involved court trials before Roman authorities, and even executions.{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=October 2016}}\n\nOne common supposition is that 1 Peter was written during the reign of [[Domitian]] (AD 81\u201396). Domitian's aggressive claim to divinity would have been rejected and resisted by Christians. Biblical scholar Paul Achtemeier believes that persecution of Christians by Domitian would have been in character, but points out that there is no evidence of official policy targeted specifically at Christians. If Christians were persecuted, it is likely to have been part of Domitian\u2019s larger policy suppressing all opposition to his self-proclaimed divinity.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> There are other scholars who explicitly dispute the idea of contextualizing 1 Peter within Domitian\u2019s reign. Duane Warden believes that Domitian\u2019s unpopularity even among Romans renders it highly unlikely that his actions would have great influence in the provinces, especially those under the direct supervision of the senate such as Asia (one of the provinces 1 Peter is addressed to).<ref>Warden, Duane. Imperial Persecution and the Dating of 1 Peter and Revelation. Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society 34:2. 1991</ref>\n\nAlso often advanced as a possible context for 1 Peter is the trials and executions of Christians in the Roman province of Bithynia-Pontus under [[Pliny the Younger]]. Scholars who support this theory believe that a famous [[Pliny the Younger on Christians|letter]] from Pliny to Emperor [[Trajan]] concerning the delation of Christians reflects the situation faced by the addressees of this epistle.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Knox, John. Pliny and I Peter: A Note on I Peter 4:14\u201316 and 3:15. Journal of Biblical Literature 72:3. 1953</ref><ref>Downing, F Gerald. Pliny's Prosecutions of Christians: Revelation and 1 Peter. Journal for the Study of the New Testament 34. 1988</ref> In Pliny's letter, written in AD 112, he asks Trajan if the accused Christians brought before him should be punished based on the name \u2018Christian\u2019 alone, or for crimes associated with the name. For biblical scholar John Knox, the use of the word \u201cname\u201d in 4:14\u201316 is the \u201ccrucial point of contact\u201d with that in Pliny\u2019s letter.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> In addition, many scholars in support of this theory believe that there is content within 1 Peter that directly mirrors the situation as portrayed in Pliny\u2019s letter. For instance, they interpret the exhortation to defend one\u2019s faith \u201cwith gentleness and reverence\u201d in 3:15\u201316 as a response to Pliny executing Christians for the obstinate manner in which they professed to be Christians. Generally, this theory is rejected mainly by scholars who read the suffering in 1 Peter to be caused by social, rather than official, discrimination.{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=October 2016}}\n\n==The Harrowing of Hell==\n{{Main article|Harrowing of Hell}}\nThe author refers to Jesus, after his death, proclaiming to spirits in prison (3:18\u201320). This passage, and a few others (such as Matthew 27:52 and Luke 23:43), are the basis of the traditional Christian belief in the descent of Christ into hell, or the harrowing of hell.<ref name=\"ODCC Descent\">\"Descent of Christ into Hell.\" Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford dictionary of the Christian church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005</ref> Though interpretations vary, some theologians{{Who|date=June 2012}} see this passage as referring to Jesus, after his death, going to a place (neither heaven nor hell in the ultimate sense) where the souls of pre-Christian people waited for the Gospel. The first creeds to mention the harrowing of hell were Arian formularies of [[Council of Sirmium|Sirmium]] (359), Nike (360), and [[Council of Constantinople (360)|Constantinople]] (360).

While this theory, first propounded by [[Ernst von Dobsch\u00fctz]] and [[Rudolf Bultmann]], is not universally accepted, Amos Wilder writes that, \"It is at least clear that there are considerable and sometimes continuous elements in the epistle whose style distinguishes them from that of the author both with respect to poetic structure and syntactic usage.\"<ref name=\"Wilder 212\">Wilder, p. 212</ref>\n\n==Authorship==\n{{main|Authorship of the Johannine works}}\nThe epistle is traditionally held to have been composed by [[John the Evangelist]], at [[Ephesus]],<ref name=\"Burton367\">Burton, p. 367</ref> when the writer was in advanced age.

Though the common authorship of the three epistles is still almost universally accepted, scholars such as [[Heinrich Julius Holtzmann]] and [[C. H. Dodd]] have maintained that the epistle and the gospel were written by different authors.<ref name=\"Wilder214\"/> There are at least two principal arguments for this view. The first is that the epistle often uses a [[demonstrative pronoun]] at the beginning of a sentence, then a particle or conjunction, followed by an explanation or definition of the demonstrative at the end of the sentence, a stylistic technique which is not used in the gospel.<ref name=\"Wilder211\"/> The second is that the author of the epistle \"uses the conditional sentence in a variety of rhetorical figures which are unknown to the gospel\".<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dodd |first1=C.

We can therefore distinguish in the epistle both a general purpose (to increase mutual joy) and a specific purpose (to provide readers with tests by which they might assure themselves of their salvation).<ref name=\"Barbour341\"/> It appears as though the author was concerned about [[heresy|heretical]] teachers that had been influencing [[church (building)|churches]] under his care.<ref name=\"Burton367\"/> Such teachers were considered [[Antichrist]]s (2:18\u201319) who had once been church leaders but whose teaching became [[heterodox]]. It appears that these teachers taught a form of [[docetism]] in which [[Jesus]] came to earth as a spirit without a real body of flesh (4:2) that his death on the cross was not as a true [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]] for sins (1:7).<ref name=\"Burton367\"/> It appears that John might have also been rebuking a proto-[[Gnostic]] named [[Cerinthus]], who also denied the true humanity of Christ.{{citation needed|reason=relies on John the Apostle really having written the letter, and that JtA really met Cerinthus as alleged \u2013 this means that such a speculative notion needs a citation!|date=September 2012}}\n\nThe purpose of the author (1:1\u20134) is to declare the Word of Life to those to whom he writes, in order that they might be united in fellowship with the Father and his Son Jesus Christ. He shows that the means of union with [[God]] are, (i) on the part of Christ, his atoning work providing salvation through faith (1:7,9; 2:2,25; 3:5; 4:9,10,14; 5:11-13,20) and his advocacy (2:1; 5:6,7); and (ii) on the part of man, holiness (1:6; 2:15,16,29; 3:10,12), obedience (2:3; 3:6,24; 5:2,3,18), purity (3:3,18), faith (3:23; 4:3; 5:5), and love (2:4,7,8; 3:11,14,16; 4:7,8,12,19-21; 5:1).\n\nWhereas the Gospel of John was written to unbelievers, this epistle was written to those who were already believers (5:13).<ref name=\"Barbour341\">Barbour, p. 341</ref> It seems likely that its audience was largely [[gentile]] rather than Jewish, since it contains few Old Testament quotations or distinctly Jewish forms of expression.<ref name=\"Burton367\"/> The epistle was probably carried by itinerant missionaries to different churches throughout the region and read aloud to the congregations, due to, in no small part, John's status as an apostle and elder within the first century church.<ref>Wilder, p. 210</ref>\n\n==Johannine Comma==\n{{main|Comma Johanneum}}\n\nA Trinitarian gloss added to Latin translations of the epistle in the 4th century was interpolated in the text over the course of the [[Middle Ages]], known as the [[Johannine Comma]].<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 978-0-19-874473-3| last = Houghton| first = H.

The first group, which McBrien calls the \"active infallibilists\", was led by [[Henry Edward Manning]] and [[Ignatius von Senestr\u00e9y]]. According to McBrien, the majority of the bishops were not so much interested in a formal definition of papal infallibility as they were in strengthening papal authority and, because of this, were willing to accept the agenda of the infallibilists. A minority, some 10 per cent of the bishops, McBrien says, opposed the proposed definition of papal infallibility on both ecclesiastical and pragmatic grounds, because, in their opinion, it departed from the ecclesiastical structure of the [[early Christianity|early Christian]] church.{{sfn|McBrien|1995|p=1297}} From a pragmatic perspective, they feared that defining papal infallibility would alienate some Catholics, create new difficulties for union with non-Catholics, and provoke interference by governments in ecclesiastical affairs.{{sfn|Kirch|1912|p=305}} Those who held this view included most of the German and Austro-Hungarian bishops, nearly half of the Americans, one third of the French, most of the [[Chaldean Catholic Church|Chaldaeans]] and [[Melkite Greek Catholic Church|Melkites]], and a few [[Armenian Catholic Church|Armenians]].{{sfn|Kirch|1912|p=305}} Only a few bishops appear to have had doubts about the dogma itself.{{sfn|Kirch|1912|p=305}}\n\n== ''Dei Filius'' ==\n{{Main|Dei Filius}}\nOn 24 April 1870, the dogmatic constitution on the Catholic faith ''[[Dei Filius]]'' was adopted unanimously. The draft presented to the council on 8 March drew no serious criticism, but a group of 35 English-speaking bishops, who feared that the opening phrase of the first chapter, \"''Sancta romana catholica Ecclesia''\" (the holy roman catholic Church), might be construed as favouring the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] [[branch theory]], later succeeded in having an additional adjective inserted, so that the final text read: \"''Sancta catholica apostolica romana Ecclesia''\" (the holy catholic apostolic roman Church).{{sfn|Lacoste|2004|p=1666}} The constitution thus set forth the teaching of the \"Holy Catholic Apostolic Roman Church\" on God, revelation and faith.{{sfn|De Mattei|2004|p=137}}\n\n== ''Pastor aeternus'' ==\n{{Main|Pastor aeternus}}\n\n[[File:Eclesi\u00e1sticos de varios pa\u00edses reunidos en Roma con Motivo del Concilio.jpg|thumb|Ecclesiastics of several countries gathered in Rome for the council]]\n\nThere was stronger opposition to the draft constitution on the nature of the church, which at first did not include the question of papal infallibility,{{sfn|\"First Vatican Council\"|2014}} but the majority party in the council, whose position on this matter was much stronger,{{sfn|Burton|Woodruff|2014}} brought it forward. It was decided to postpone discussion of everything in the draft except infallibility.{{sfn|Burton|Woodruff|2014}} The decree did not go forward without controversy; Cardinal {{ill|Filippo Guidi|WD=Q1230758}}, Archbishop of Bologna, proposed adding that the Pope is assisted by \"the counsel of the bishops manifesting the tradition of the churches.\"  The Pope rejected Guidi's view of the bishops as witnesses to the tradition, maintaining that \"I am the tradition.\"{{sfn|Duffy|2014|loc=loc.&nbsp;5428\u20135439}}\n\nOn 13 July 1870, a preliminary vote on the section on infallibility was held in a general congregation: 451 voted simply in favour (''placet''), 88 against (''non placet''), and 62 in favour but on condition of some amendment (''placet iuxta modum'').{{sfn|Hughes|1961|pp=342, 362}} This made evident what the final outcome would be, and some 60 members of the opposition left Rome so as not to be associated with approval of the document. The final vote, with a choice only between ''placet'' and ''non placet'', was taken on 18 July 1870, with 433 votes in favour and only 2 against defining as a dogma the infallibility of the pope when speaking ''ex cathedra''.{{sfn|\"First Vatican Council\"|2014}} The two votes in opposition were cast by Bishop [[Aloisio Riccio]] and Bishop [[Edward Fitzgerald (bishop)|Edward Fitzgerald]].{{sfnm |1a1=Hughes |1y=1961 |1pp=364, 381 |2a1=Kirch |2y=1912 |2p=307}}\n\nThe dogmatic constitution states that the Pope has \"full and supreme power of jurisdiction over the whole Church\" (chapter 3:9); and that, when he\n{{quote|speaks ''ex cathedra'', that is, when, in the exercise of his office as shepherd and teacher of all Christians, in virtue of his supreme apostolic authority, he defines a doctrine concerning faith or morals to be held by the whole Church, he possesses, by the divine assistance promised to him in blessed Peter, that infallibility which the divine Redeemer willed his Church to enjoy in defining doctrine concerning faith or morals [chapter 4:9]}}\n\nNone of the bishops who had argued that proclaiming the definition was inopportune refused to accept it. Some Catholics, mainly of German language and largely inspired by the historian [[Ignaz von D\u00f6llinger]], formed the separate [[Old Catholic Church]] in protest; von D\u00f6llinger did not formally join the new group.{{sfn|Hennesey|2009}}\n\n== Suspension ==\n[[File:Engraving of First Vatican Council.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Drawing showing the First Vatican Council]]\n\nDiscussion of the rest of the document on the nature of the church was to continue when the bishops returned after a summer break. However, in the meanwhile the [[Franco-Prussian War]] broke out. With the swift German advance and the capture of [[Napoleon III|Emperor Napoleon III]], French troops protecting papal rule in Rome withdrew from the city.\n\nConsequently, on 20 September 1870, one month after the Kingdom of Italy [[Capture of Rome|had occupied Rome]], Pope Pius IX, who then considered himself a prisoner in the Vatican, issued the bull ''Postquam Dei munere'', adjourning the council indefinitely.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} While some proposed to continue the council in the Belgian city of [[Mechlin]], it was never reconvened.{{sfn|Kirch|1912|p=307}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Second Vatican Council]]\n\n== References ==\n=== Notes ===\n{{reflist|22em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n{{refbegin|35em|indent=yes}}\n: {{cite encyclopedia\n|last1=Burton\n|first1=Ivor F.\n|last2=Woodruff\n|first2=Douglas\n|author2-link=Douglas Woodruff\n|year=2014\n|title=Pius IX\n|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Pius-IX\n|encyclopedia=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]\n|publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\n|access-date=2 March 2018\n|ref=harv\n}}\n: {{cite book\n|last=De Mattei\n|first=Roberto\n|author-link=Roberto de Mattei\n|year=2004\n|title=Pius IX\n|translator-last=Laughland\n|translator-first=John\n|location=Leominster, England\n|publisher=Gracewing\n|ref=harv\n}}\n: {{cite book\n|last=Duffy\n|first=Eamon\n|author-link=Eamon Duffy\n|year=2014\n|title=Saints and Sinners: A History of the Popes\n|edition=4th\n|location=New Haven, Connecticut\n|publisher=Yale University Press\n|isbn=978-0-300-11597-0\n|ref=harv\n}}\n: {{cite encyclopedia\n|year=2014\n|title=First Vatican Council\n|url=https://www.britannica.com/event/First-Vatican-Council\n|encyclopedia=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]\n|publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\n|access-date=2 March 2018\n|ref={{sfnref|\"First Vatican Council\"|2014}}\n}}\n: {{cite encyclopedia\n|last=Hennesey\n|first=James\n|year=2009\n|title=First Vatican Council\n|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761576278/first_vatican_council.html\n|encyclopedia=[[Encarta]]\n|publisher=Microsoft\n|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwcD77Xf?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761576278/first_vatican_council.html\n|archive-date=31 October 2009\n|access-date=2 March 2018\n|ref=harv\n}}\n: {{cite book\n|last=Hughes\n|first=Philip\n|year=1961\n|title=The Church in Crisis: A History of the General Councils, 325\u20131870\n|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.178473\n|location=Garden City, New York\n|publisher=Hanover House\n|access-date=3 March 2018\n|ref=harv\n}}\n: {{cite encyclopedia\n|last=Kirch\n|first=J.&nbsp;M.

The Council sought to: (a) bring an end to the practice of the conferring of ecclesiastical benefices by people who were laymen; (b) free the election of bishops and abbots from secular influence; (c) clarify the separation of spiritual and temporal affairs; (d) re-establish the principle that spiritual authority resides solely in the Church; (e) abolish the claim of the emperors to influence papal elections.\n\nThe council convoked by Callistus II was significant in size: three hundred bishops and more than six hundred abbots assembled at Rome in March, 1123; Callistus presided in person. During the Council the decisions of the Concordat of Worms were read and ratified. Various other decisions were promulgated.\n\n==History leading to the Council==\nThe First Lateran Council was called by [[Pope Callistus II]] whose reign began  February 1, 1119.  It demarcated the end of the [[Investiture controversy]] which had begun before the time of [[Pope Gregory VII]].  The issues had been contentious and had continued with unabated bitterness for almost a century.   Guido, as he was called before his elevation to the papacy,<ref name=\"Hardouin VI, 2, 1916\">Hardouin VI, 2, 1916.</ref> was the son of [[William I, Count of Burgundy]].<ref name=\"Hardouin VI, 2, 1916\"/>  He was closely connected with nearly all the royal houses of Europe on both sides of his family.  He had been named the [[papal legate]] to France by [[Pope Paschal II]].  During Guido's tenure in this office, Paschal II yielded to the military threats of [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor]], and was induced to issue the [[Privilegium]] in the year 1111.  By this document the Church gave up much of what had been claimed and subsequently attained by [[Pope Gregory VII]] and his [[Gregorian Reforms]].<ref name=\"Hardouin VI, 2, 1916\"/>\n\nThese concessions did not bring the expected peace but were received with violent reactionary opposition everywhere.  Europe had come to expect an end to the Investiture controversy, and was not willing to return to the old days when the Holy Roman Emperor named the pope.<ref name=\"Hardouin VI, 2, 1916\"/>  The greatest resistance was seen in France and was led by Guido, who still held the office of the papal legate.<ref name=\"Hardouin VI, 2, 1916\"/>    He had been present in the [[Lateran Synod]] of 1112 which had proclaimed the Privilegium of 1111.  On his return to France, Guido convoked an assembly of the French and Burgundian bishops at Vienne (1112).  There the lay investiture of the clergy (the practice of the king, especially the Holy Roman Emperor naming bishops and the pope) was denounced as heretical.<ref name=\"Hardouin VI, 2, 1916\"/>   A sentence of excommunication was  pronounced against Henry V, who had extorted through violence from the pope the concessions documented in the Privilegium.  The agreement was deemed to be opposed to the interests of the Church.<ref name=\"Hardouin VI, 2, 1916\"/>   The decrees from the assembly of Vienne which denounced the Privilegium were sent to Paschal II with a request for confirmation. [[Pope Paschal II]] confirmed these which were received in general terms, on  October 20, 1112.<ref name=\"Hardouin VI, 2, 1916\"/>\n\nGuido was later created cardinal by Pope Paschal II.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Synod of Vienne, see MANSI, XXI, 175</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Synod of Vienne:  HARDOUIN, VI, 2, 1752</ref><ref name=\"Synod of Reims, MANSI, XXI, 187\">Synod of Reims, MANSI, XXI, 187</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Synod of Reims:  HEFELE, Conciliengesch., V, 344</ref><ref name=\"Reims 1119\">Synod of Reims:  HALLER, Die Verhandlungen zu Mouzon (1119)</ref>   The latter did not seem to have been pleased with Guido\u2019s  bold and forward attacks upon [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/><ref name=\"Synod of Reims, MANSI, XXI, 187\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/><ref name=\"Reims 1119\"/>  On the death of Paschal II, January 21, 1118, [[Gelasius II]] was elected pope.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/><ref name=\"Synod of Reims, MANSI, XXI, 187\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/><ref name=\"Reims 1119\"/>  He was immediately seized by the Italian allies of Henry V, and on his liberation by the populace fled to Gaeta, where he was crowned.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/><ref name=\"Synod of Reims, MANSI, XXI, 187\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/><ref name=\"Reims 1119\"/>   Henry V demanded the confirmation of the \"Privilegium\" and  received no satisfactory reply. He then set about naming [[Burdinus]], the archbishop of Braga, as his own pope.  This pope assumed the name Gregory VIII, but came to be known as [[antipope Gregory VIII]].  Burdinus had already been deposed and excommunicated because he had crowned Henry V and the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] in Rome in 1117.\n\nThe excommunication of Bardinus was reiterated in Canon 6 of the document produced by Lateran I.  Gelasius II promptly excommunicated the antipope Gregory VIII and Henry V.  Gelasius was forced to flee under duress from the army of Henry V, and took refuge in the monastery of Cluny, where he died in January 1119.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/><ref name=\"Synod of Reims, MANSI, XXI, 187\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/><ref name=\"Reims 1119\"/>  On the fourth day after the death of Gelasius II, February I, 1119,  owing mainly to the exertions of Cardinal Cuno, Guido was elected pope and assumed the title of Callistus II. He was crowned  Pope at Vienne on February 9, 1119.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/><ref name=\"Synod of Reims, MANSI, XXI, 187\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/><ref name=\"Reims 1119\"/>\n\nBecause of his close connection with the great royal families of Germany, France, England and Denmark, Callistus' papacy was received with much anticipation and  celebration throughout Europe.  There was a real hope throughout the Continent that the [[Investiture controversy]] might be settled once and for all.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/><ref name=\"Synod of Reims, MANSI, XXI, 187\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/><ref name=\"Reims 1119\"/>   In the interest of conciliation, even the papal embassy was received by  [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor]] at Strasburg.  However, it soon became clear that Henry was not willing to concede his presumed and ancient right to name the pope and bishops within his kingdom.  Perhaps to demonstrate conciliation or because of political necessity,  Henry withdrew his support for [[antipope Gregory VIII]].\n\nIt was agreed that Henry and Pope Callistus would meet at Mousson.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/><ref name=\"Synod of Reims, MANSI, XXI, 187\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/><ref name=\"Reims 1119\"/>   On June 8, 1119, Callistus held a synod at Toulouse to proclaim the disciplinary reforms he had worked to attain in the French Church.   In October, 1119, he opened the council at Reims. [[Louis VI of France]] and most of the barons of France attended this council along with more than four hundred bishops and abbots.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/><ref name=\"Synod of Reims, MANSI, XXI, 187\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/><ref name=\"Reims 1119\"/> The Pope was also to meet with [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor]] at Mousson.  However, Henry showed up with an army of thirty thousand men.  Callistus left Reims for Mousson, but upon learning of the warlike stance of Henry, quickly retreated back to Reims.  Here, the Church dealt with issues of simony, concubinage of the clergy.\n\nIt was clear by now that Henry was in no mood to reconcile and a compromise with him was not to be had.  The Conclave at Reims considered the situation and determined, as an entire Church, to formally excommunicate both Henry V and the antipope Gregory VIII.  This occurred on October 30, 1119.  While at Reims, Callistus tried to effect a settlement with [[Henry I of England]] and his brother Robert.  This too, met with failure.\n\nCallistus was determined to enter Rome which was occupied by the German forces and the antipope Gregory VIII.   There was an uprising by the population which forced Gregory VIII to flee the city.  After much political and military intrigue in Rome and the southern Italian states, Gregory VIII was formally deposed and Callistus II was generally  recognized as the legitimate Pope in 1121.  Having become the established power in Italy, Callistus now returned the conflict with Henry V over the issue of lay investiture.  Henry had been the recipient of great pressure from many of his barons in Germany over his conflict with the pope.  Some had entered into open rebellion.  Henry was forced by circumstances to seek a peace with Callistus.  Initial negotiations were conducted in October, 1121, at Wurzburg.  Lambert, the Cardinal of Ostia was dispatched to convoke a synod at Worms, which began on September 8, 1122.    By September 23, the [[Concordat of Worms]], also called the Pactum Calixtinum was concluded.  On his side, the emperor gave up his claim to investiture with ring and crosier and granted freedom of election to the episcopal sees.\n\nThe elections of bishops could be witnessed by the emperor or his representatives.  Callistus obtained the right to name bishops throughout Germany, but still did not have this power in much of Burgundy and Italy.<ref>Concordat of Worms, see MANSI, XXI, 273, 287</ref><ref>Concordat of Worms: JAFFE, Bibl.

The council was most representative with nearly three hundred bishops and six hundred abbots from every part of Catholic Europe being present.  It convened on March 18, 1123.  Decrees were also passed directed against [[simony]], concubinage among the clergy, church robbers, and forgers of Church documents; the council also reaffirmed indulgences for Crusaders.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/><ref name=\"Synod of Reims, MANSI, XXI, 187\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/><ref name=\"Reims 1119\"/>\n\nIn the remaining few years of his life, Callistus II attempted to secure the status of the Church as it had existed at the end of the reign of [[Pope Gregory VII]].  He reorganized and reformed the churches around Rome, canonized [[Conrad of Constance]], condemned the teaching of [[Peter de Bruis]], confirmed the Bishop Thurston of York against the wishes of [[Henry I of England]], and affirmed the freedom of York from the see of Canterbury.  Callistus died December 13, 1124. He was succeeded by [[Pope Honorius II]].  Callistus II was a strong figure who brought a relative, if tentative peace between Germany and the Church.  The [[Concordat of Worms]] and the First Lateran Council changed forever the belief in the [[divine right of kings]] to name the pope and bishops, and reshaped the nature of church and state forever.<ref>Biographies by Pandulphus Aletrinus, Aragonius and Bernardus Guidonis (Muratori, Script.

In this translation,<ref>*[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/lateran1.html Medieval Sourcebook: First Lateran Council]: Canons with annotations</ref> the precepts of the [[Concordat of Worms]] are codified in Canons 2, 4 and 10.\n\nCANON I\n \nSummary. Ordinations and promotions made for pecuniary considerations are devoid of every dignity.\n\nText.

Has anyone thus secured ordination or promotion in the Church, the rank acquired shall be devoid of every dignity.\n\nCANON 2\n\nSummary. Only a [[Presbyter|priest]] may be made [[Provost (religion)|provost]], [[archpriest]], and [[Dean (Christianity)|dean]]; only a [[deacon]] may be [[archdeacon]].\n\nText.

[[Laity|Lay persons]], no matter how pious they may be, have no authority to dispose of anything that belongs to the Church.\n\nText. In accordance with the decision of Pope Stephen,  we declare that lay persons, no matter how devout they may be, have no \nauthority to dispose of anything belonging to the Church, but according to the Apostolic canon  the supervision of all ecclesiastical affairs belongs to the bishop, who shall administer them conformably to the will of God. If therefore any prince or other layman shall arrogate to himself the right of disposition, control, or ownership of ecclesiastical goods or properties, let him be judged guilty of sacrilege.\n\nCANON 5\n\nSummary. Marriages between blood-relatives are forbidden.\n\nText. We forbid marriages between blood-relatives because they are forbidden by the divine and secular laws. Those who contract such alliances, as also their offspring, the divine laws not only ostracize but declare accursed, while the civil laws brand them as infamous and deprive them of hereditary rights. We, therefore, following the example of our fathers, declare and stigmatize them as infamous.\n\nCANON 6\n\nSummary. Ordinations by Burdinus and the bishops consecrated by him are invalid.\n\nText. The ordinations made by the [[Antipope Gregory VIII|heresiarch Burdinus]] after his condemnation by the Roman Church, as also those made by the bishops consecrated by him after that point of time, we declare to be invalid.\n\nCANON 7\n\nSummary. No one is permitted to arrogate to himself the [[Episcopal polity|episcopal authority]] in matters pertaining to the [[Cure of souls|cura animarum]] and the bestowal of [[benefice]]s.\n\nText. No archdeacon, archpriest, provost, or dean shall bestow on another the care of souls or the prebends of a church without the decision or consent of the bishop; indeed, as the sacred canons point out, the care of souls and the disposition of ecclesiastical property are vested in the authority of the bishop. If anyone shall dare act contrary to this and arrogate to himself the power belonging to the bishop, let him be expelled from the Church.\n\nCANON 8\n\nSummary. Military persons are forbidden under penalty of [[anathema]] to invade or forcibly hold the city of [[Benevento]].\n\nText.

If anyone act contrary to this, let him be anathematized.\n\nCANON 9\n\nSummary. Those [[Excommunication|excommunicated]] by one bishop, may not be restored by others.\n\nText. We absolutely forbid that those who have been excommunicated by their own bishops be received into the communion of the Church by other bishops, [[abbot]]s, and clerics.\n[[Image:Investiturewoodcut.jpg|left|thumb|Canons 2, 4 and 10 ended the practice of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] naming bishops and the pope.]]\n\nCANON 10\n\nSummary. A bishop [[Consecration|consecrated]] after an [[Canonical election|uncanonical election]] shall be deposed.\n\nText. No one shall be consecrated bishop who has not been canonically elected.

Whoever, therefore, shall dare molest or seize these during the absence of their owners, shall incur excommunication. Those, however, who with a view of going to Jerusalem or to Spain (that is, against the [[Moors]]) are known to have attached the [[Jerusalem cross|cross to their garments]] and afterward removed it, we command in virtue of our Apostolic authority to replace it and begin the journey within a year from the coming Easter. Otherwise we shall excommunicate them and [[interdict]] within their territory all divine service except the [[Infant baptism|baptism of infants]] and the administration of the [[last rites]] to the dying.\n\nCANON 12\n\nSummary. The property of the porticani dying without heirs is not to be disposed of in a manner contrary to the wish of the one deceased.\n\nText. With the advice of our brethren and of the entire Curia, as well as with the will and consent of the prefect, we decree the abolition of that evil custom which has hitherto prevailed among the porticani, namely, of disposing, contrary to the wish of the one deceased, of the property of porticani dying without heirs; with this understanding, however, that in future the porticani remain faithful to the Roman Church, to us and to our successors.\n\nCANON 13\n\nSummary. If anyone violates the [[Peace and Truce of God|truce of God]] and after the third admonition does not make satisfaction, he shall be anathematized.\n\nText. If anyone shall violate the truce of God he shall be admonished three times by the bishop to make satisfaction. If he disregards the third admonition the bishop, either with the advice of the metropolitan or with that of two or one of the neighboring bishops, shall pronounce the sentence of anathema against the violator and in writing denounce him to all the bishops. \n \nCANON 14\n\nSummary. Laymen are absolutely forbidden to remove offerings from the altars of Roman churches.\n\nText. Following the canons of the holy fathers, we absolutely and under penalty of anathema forbid laymen to remove the offerings from the altars of the churches of [[Old St. Peter's Basilica|St. Peter]], of The Savior ([[Lateran Basilica]]), of St. Mary Rotund, in a word, from the altars of any of the churches or from the crosses. By our Apostolic authority we forbid also the fortifying of churches and their conversion to profane uses.\n\nCANON 15\n\nSummary. [[Counterfeit money|Counterfeiters of money]] shall be excommunicated.\n\nText. Whoever manufactures or knowingly expends counterfeit money, shall be cut off from the communion of the faithful (excommunicated) as one accursed, as an oppressor of the poor and a disturber of the city.\n\nCANON 16\n\nSummary. Robbers of pilgrims and of merchants shall be excommunicated.\n\nText.

Abbots and monks may not have the cura animarum.\n\nText. We forbid abbots and monks to impose public penances, to visit the sick, to administer extreme unction, and to sing public masses. The chrism, holy oil, consecration of altars, and ordination of clerics they shall obtain from the bishops in whose dioceses they reside.\n\nCANON 18\n\nSummary. The appointment of priests to churches belongs to the bishops, and without their consent they may not receive tithes and churches from laymen.\n\nText.

If they act otherwise, let them be subject to the canonical penalties.\n\nCANON 19\n\nSummary. Taxes paid to bishops by monks since Gregory VII must be continued. Monks may not by prescription acquire the possessions of churches and of bishops.\n\nText.

We absolutely forbid abbots and monks to acquire by prescription after thirty years the possessions of churches and of shops.\n\nCANON 20\n\nSummary. Churches and their possessions, as well as the person and things connected with them, shall remain safe and unmolested.\n\nText. Having in mind the example of our fathers and discharging the duty of our pastoral office, we decree that churches and their possessions, as well as the persons connected with them, namely, clerics and monks and their servants ([[Lay brother|conversi]]), also the laborers and the things they use, shall remain safe and unmolested. If anyone shall dare act contrary to this and, recognizing his crime, does not within the space of thirty days make proper amends, let him be cut off from the Church and anathematized.\n\nCANON 21\n\nSummary. Clerics in [[major orders]] may not marry, and marriages already contracted must be dissolved.\n\nText. We absolutely forbid priests, deacons, subdeacons, and monks to have concubines or to contract marriage. We decree in accordance with the definitions of the sacred canons, that marriages already contracted by such persons must be dissolved, and that the persons be condemned to do penance.\n\nCANON 22\n\nSummary. The alienation of possessions of the [[Patrimonium Sancti Petri|exarchate of Ravenna]] is condemned, and the Ordinaries made by the intruders are invalid.\n\nText. The alienation that has been made especially by [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto]], Guido, Jerome, and perhaps by Philip of possessions of the exarchate of Ravenna, we condemn. In a general way we declare invalid the alienations in whatever manner made by bishops and abbots whether intruded or canonically elected, and also the ordinations conferred by them whether with the consent of the clergy of the Church or simoniacally. We also absolutely forbid any cleric in any way to alienate his prebend or any ecclesiastical benefice. If he has presumed to do this in the past or shall presume to do so in the future, his action shall be null and he shall be subject to the canonical penalties .\n\n==Results of the Council==\nLateran I was the first of four Lateran Councils between the years 1123\u20131215.  The first  was not very original in its concept, nor one called to meet a pressing theological question.  For the most part, [[Pope Callistus II]] summoned the council to ratify the various meetings and concords which had been occurring in and around Rome for several years.  The most pressing issue was that of the [[Investiture controversy]] which had consumed nearly a century of contention and open warfare.  At the heart of the question was the ancient right of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] to name the pope as well as bishops and priests.  These would be invested with some secular symbol such as a sword or scepter and the spiritual authority represented by a ring, miter and crosier.  To an illiterate population, it appeared the bishop or abbot was now the king\u2019s inferior and owed his position to the king.  This issue came to the fore in the first part of the eleventh century when Rome and the pope sought autonomy from the Holy Roman Emperor.  It had been a central issue in the reign of [[Pope Gregory VII]] and his battles with [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor]].<ref>Bellitto, Christopher M., pp 49\u201356  \u201cThe General Councils: A History of the Twenty-one Church Councils from Nicaea to Vatican II\u201d, Paulist Press, Mahway, N.

Years of teaching by Roman trained priests and bishops in Germany had led to an educated generation which rejected the idea of [[divine right of kings]].

In practicality, the process continued to a certain extent.  The issue of [[separation of Church and State]] was simply recast in a different direction.  Of all the [[Gregorian Reforms]] which were embodied by Lateran I, celibacy of the clergy was the most successful.  [[Simony]] was curtailed. As time progressed, secular interference into the politics of the Church was seen to continue, albeit in different ways from that of the [[Investiture controversy]].\n\nIt has been argued by some historians that the [[Concordat of Worms]] and its reiteration by Lateran I were little more than face saving measures by the Church.  [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor]] continued to name bishops within his kingdom.  His control over the papacy was definitely abated.<ref>Dahlmus J. pp. 225\u2013229, \"The Middle Ages, A Popular History\", Doubleday and Co., Garden City, New York, 1968</ref>  At the time, the Concordat of Worms was proclaimed as a great victory for Henry V inside the Holy Roman Empire.  It did serve to constrain much of the most recent warfare in and outside the empire.  In the end, Henry V died the monarch of a much diminished kingdom.<ref>Gontard, F.  pp. 240\u2013241,   \"The Chair of Peter, A History of the Papacy\", Holt, Rinehart and Winston, New York, 1964</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/lateran1.html Medieval Sourcebook: First Lateran Council]: Canons with annotations\n*[http://www.legionofmarytidewater.com/faith/ECUM09.HTM First Lateran Council]\n\n==See also==\n*[[Concordat of Worms]]\n*[[Charter of Liberties]]\n\n{{Ecumenical councils}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:First Council Of The Lateran}}\n[[Category:1123 in Europe]]\n[[Category:Lateran councils|1]]\n[[Category:12th-century Catholic Church Councils]]\n[[Category:Investiture Controversy]]\n[[Category:Ecumenical councils|Lateran 1]]\n[[Category:12th century in the Papal States]]", "sha1": "hgop80u2grpx1yg4snm320wnqjlwzv5"}}, {"title": "Four Noble Truths", "ns": "0", "id": "11393", "revision": {"id": "863366655", "parentid": "863363136", "timestamp": "2018-10-10T10:02:31Z", "contributor": {"username": "Joshua Jonathan", "id": "15304212"}, "comment": "/* Substituting \"liberating insight\" */ ce", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "[[File:Astasahasrika Prajnaparamita Dharmacakra Discourse.jpeg |thumb|right|240px|The Buddha teaching the Four Noble Truths.

Cousins, the four truths are not restricted to the well-known form where ''dukkha'' is the subject. Other forms take \"the world, the arising of the world\" or \"the [[Asava|\u0101savas]], the arising of the \u0101savas\" as their subject. According to Cousins, \"the well-known form is simply shorthand for all of the forms.\"{{sfn|Cousins|2001|p=36}} \"The world\" refers to the [[sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra]]s, that is, all compounded things,<ref group=web>[http://dharmafarer.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/7.2-Rohitassa-S-s2.26-piya.pdf The Dharmafarers, ''Rhitassa Sutra'' (Samyutta Nikaya 2.26)]</ref> or to the [[Ayatana|six sense spheres]].{{sfn|Choong|2000|p=84}}\n\nThe various terms all point to the same basic idea of Buddhism, as described in [[Skandha|five skandhas]] and [[Twelve Nid\u0101nas|twelve nid\u0101nas]]: sense-contact with objects leads to sensation, perception, [[Sa\u1e45kh\u0101ra]] ('inclinations', c.q. craving etc.), and consciousness. The ''Twelve Nid\u0101nas'' describe how this also leads to rebirth: from sensation comes craving, from craving comes karma, from karma comes rebirth. The aim of the Buddhist path is to reverse this causal chain: when there is no (response to) sensation, there is no craving, no karma, no rebirth.{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2000|p=840}}{{sfn|Harvey|2013|p=55-59}}\n\n===Truths for the noble ones===\nThe Pali terms ''ariya sacca'' (Sanskrit: ''arya satya'') are commonly translated as \"noble truths\". This translation is a convention started by the earliest translators of Buddhist texts into English. According to K.R. Norman, this is just one of several possible translations.{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=41}} According to [[Paul Williams (philosopher)|Paul Williams]],{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=41}}\n{{quote|[T]here is no particular reason why the Pali expression ariyasaccani should be translated as 'noble truths'. It could equally be translated as 'the nobles' truths', or 'the truths for nobles', or 'the nobilising truths', or 'the truths of, possessed by, the noble ones' [...] In fact the Pali expression (and its Sanskrit equivalent) can mean all of these, although the Pali commentators place 'the noble truths' as the least important in their understanding.{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=41}}}}\n\nThe term \"arya\" was later added to the four truths.{{sfn|Norman|2003|p=220}}{{sfn|Anderson|1999}}{{sfn|Analayo|2013|p=15}} The term ''[[Arya (Buddhism)|ariya]]'' (Sanskrit: ''arya'') can be translated as \"noble\", \"not ordinary\", \"valuable\", \"precious\".{{refn|group=note|Ajahn Sucitto states: \"So the four truths (ariya sacca) are generally called \u201cnoble\u201d truths, although one might also translate ariya as \u201cprecious.\u201d \"{{sfn|Ajahn Sucitto|2010|loc=Kindle Location 122}} }} \"pure\",{{sfn|Mingyur Rinpoche|2007|p=70}} Paul Williams:\n{{quote|The Aryas are the noble ones, the saints, those who have attained 'the fruits of the path', 'that middle path the Tathagata has comprehended which promotes sight and knowledge, and which tends to peace, higher wisdom, enlightenment, and Nibbana'.{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=52}}}}\n\nThe term ''[[satya|sacca]]'' (Sanskrit: ''[[satya]]'') is a central term in Indian thought and religion. It is typically translated as \"truth\"; but it also means \"that which is in accord with reality\", or \"reality\". According to [[Rupert Gethin]], the four truths are \"four 'true things' or 'realities' whose nature, we are told, the Buddha finally understood on the night of his awakening.\"{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=60}} They function as \"a convenient conceptual framework for making sense of Buddhist thought.\"{{sfn|Gethin|1998|p=60}}{{refn|group=note|name=\"Gethin_framework\"|Gethin: \"The word satya (Pali sacca) can certainly mean truth, but it might equally be rendered as 'real' or 'actual thing'. That is, we are not dealing here with propositional truths with which we must either agree or disagree, but with four 'true things' or 'realities' whose nature, we are told, the Buddha finally understood on the night of his awakening.

So embedded is this Indian soteriological framework in Buddhism that Buddhists might find it unintelligible that one would even consider questioning it. For to dispense with such key doctrines as rebirth, the law of kamma, and liberation from the cycle of birth and death would surely undermine the entire edifice of Buddhism itself.

The reason people can no longer accept these beliefs need not be because they reject them as false, but because such views are too much at variance with everything else they know and believe about the nature of themselves and the world. They simply do not work anymore, and the intellectual gymnastics one needs to perform to make them work seem casuistic and, for many, unpersuasive.

Instead, they are a rather late theory on the content of the Buddha's enlightenment.{{sfn|Hirakawa|1990|p=28}} According to Vetter and Bronkhorst, the earliest Buddhist path consisted of a set of practices which culminate in the practice of ''dhyana'',{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxi-xxxvii}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=93-111}} leading to a calm of mind and [[Sati (Buddhism)|awareness]] (mindfulness){{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=XXV}} which according to Vetter ''is'' the liberation which is being sought.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxi-xxxvii}}{{refn|group=note|Note that ''dhyana'' is not the same as ''samatha'', the calming of the mind by one-pointedly concentration. While ''dhyana'' also leads to a calm of mind, it aids in developing mindfulness, which is necessary to be aware of the arising of disturbing, selfish, thoughts and emotions, and to counter them. Wynne: \"...the Buddha taught a \u2018middle way\u2019 between pure meditation and cognitive practices. The states of absorption induced by meditation were considered useful and necessary, but in distinction from the meditative mainstream their ultimate aim was insight. For the Buddha it was vitally important that the meditative adept should apply his concentrative state to the practice of mindfulness (Sn 1070: ''satima''; Sn 1111: ''ajjhatta\u00f1 ca bahiddha ca nabhinandato''; Sn 1113: ''ajjhatta\u00f1 ca bahiddha ca natthi ti passato''), and work towards the attainment of insight. According to this view meditation alone, the goal of the meditative mainstream would have been harshly criticized in the earliest Buddhism.\"{{sfn|Wynne|2007|p=105}}}} Later on, \"liberating insight\" came to be regarded as equally liberating.{{sfn|Gombrich|1997|p=99-102}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=93-111}} This \"liberating insight\" came to be exemplified by ''prajna'', or the insight in the \"four truths,\"{{sfn|Gombrich|1997|p=99-102}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=93-111}} but also by other elements of the Buddhist teachings.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxi-xxxvii}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=chpter 7}} According to Vetter and Bronkhorst, this growing importance of \"liberating insight\" was a response to other religious groups in India, which held that a liberating insight was indispensable for ''[[moksha]]'', liberation from rebirth.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxxii, xxxiii}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=54-55, 96, 99}}{{refn|group=note|Tillmann Vetter: \"Very likely the cause was the growing influence of a non-Buddhist spiritual environment\u00b7which claimed that one can be released only by some truth or higher knowledge.

Their solution was to postulate a fundamental difference between the inner soul or self and the body. The inner self is unchangeable, and unaffected by actions. By insight into this difference, one was liberated. To equal this emphasis on insight, Buddhists presented insight into their most essential teaching as equally liberating. What exactly was regarded as the central insight \"varied along with what was considered most central to the teaching of the Buddha.\"{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=54-55, 96, 99}}}} This change is reflected in the canon, where, according to Bronkhorst,\n{{quote|...the accounts which include the Four Noble Truths had a completely different conception of the process of liberation than the one which includes the Four Dhyanas and the destruction of the intoxicants.{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=110}}}}\n\nAccording to Vetter and Bonkhorst, the ideas on what exactly constituted this \"liberating insight\" was not fixed but developed over time.{{sfn|Vetter|1988|p=xxi-xxxvii}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=chpter 7}} According to Bronkhorst, in [[Presectarian Buddhism|earliest Buddhism]] the four truths did not serve as a description of \"liberating insight\".{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=107}} Initially the term ''prajna'' served to denote this \"liberating insight.\" Later on, ''prajna'' was replaced in the suttas by the \"four truths.\"{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=99-100, 102-111}}{{sfn|Anderson|1999}} This happened in those texts where practicing the four jhanas preceded the attainment of \"liberating insight,\" and where this practice of the four jhanas then culminates in \"liberating insight.\"{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=108}} This \"liberating insight\" came to be defined as \"insight into the four truths,\" which is presented as the \"liberating insight\" which constituted the [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|awakening]], or \"enlightenment\" of the Buddha.

Schmithausen further states that still other descriptions of this \"liberating insight\" exist in the Buddhist canon:\n{{quote|\"that the five Skandhas are impermanent, disagreeable, and neither the Self nor belonging to oneself\";{{refn|group=note|Majjhima Nikaya 26}} \"the contemplation of the arising and disappearance (''udayabbaya'') of the five Skandhas\";{{refn|group=note|Anguttara Nikaya II.45 (PTS)}} \"the realisation of the Skandhas as empty (''rittaka''), vain (''tucchaka'') and without any pith or substance (''asaraka'').{{refn|group=note|Samyutta Nikaya III.140-142 (PTS)}}{{sfn|Bronkhorst|1993|p=101}}}}\n\nIn contrast, Thanissaro Bikkhu presents the view that the four truths, [[pratityasamutpada]] and anatta are inextricably intertwined <ref>Wings to Awakening Part 3, https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/wings/part3.html#part3-h-1</ref>.\n\n===Acquiring the ''dhamma-eye'' and destroying the ''\u0101sav\u0101s''===\nIn their symbolic function, the sutras present the insight into the four truths as the culmination of the Buddh's path to awakening. In the ''Vinayapitaka'' and the ''Sutta-pitaka'' they have the same symbolic function, in a reenactment by his listeners of the Buddha's awakening by attaining the ''dhamma-eye''.

It is devoid of rebirth, karma, nirvana, realms of existence, and other concepts of Buddhism, with doctrines such as the Four Noble Truths reformulated and restated in modernistic terms.{{sfn|Gowans|2014|p=18-23, 91\u201394}}{{sfn|Prothero|1996|p=128}}{{refn|group=note|Prothereo describes how Theosophist [[Henry Steel Olcott]] (1832-1907) reinterpreted Buddhism: \"In addition to a restatement of the Four Noble Truths and the Five Precepts for lay Buddhists, the fourteen propositions included: an affirmation of religious tolerance and of the evolution of the universe, a rejection of supernaturalism, heaven or hell, and superstition, and an emphasis on education and the use of reason.\"{{sfn|Prothero|1996|p=128}}}}{{refn|group=note|According to Owen Flanagan, the proportion of people in North America that believe in heaven is about the same as the proportion of East and Southeast Asia who believe in rebirth.

In traditional Buddhism, rebirth continues the ''dukkha'' and the path to cessation of ''dukkha'' isn't suicide, but the fourth reality of the Four Noble Truths.{{sfn|Spiro|1982|p=39\u201342}} The \"naturalized Buddhism\", according to Gowans, is a radical revision to traditional Buddhist thought and practice, and it attacks the structure behind the hopes, needs and rationalization of the realities of human life to traditional Buddhists in East, Southeast and South Asia.{{sfn|Gowans|2014|p=18-23, 91\u201394}} According to Keown, it may not be necessary to believe in some of the core Buddhist doctrines to be a Buddhist, but the rebirth, karma, [[Sa\u1e43s\u0101ra (Buddhism)|realms of existence]] and cyclic universe doctrines underpin the Four Noble Truths in Buddhism.{{sfn|Keown|2009|p=60\u201363, 74-85, 185-187}}\n\nTraditional Buddhist scholars disagree with these modernist Western interpretations. Bhikkhu Bodhi, for example, states that rebirth is an integral part of the Buddhist teachings as found in the sutras, despite the problems that \"modernist interpreters of Buddhism\" seem to have with it.<ref group=web name=\"BB-rebirth\"/>{{refn|group=note|Bhikkhu Bodhi: \"Newcomers to Buddhism are usually impressed by the clarity, directness, and earthy practicality of the Dhamma as embodied in such basic teachings as the Four Noble Truths, the Noble Eightfold Path, and the threefold training. These teachings, as clear as day-light, are accessible to any serious seeker looking for a way beyond suffering. When, however, these seekers encounter the doctrine of rebirth, they often balk, convinced it just doesn't make sense. At this point, they suspect that the teaching has swerved off course, tumbling from the grand highway of reason into wistfulness and speculation. Even modernist interpreters of Buddhism seem to have trouble taking the rebirth teaching seriously. Some dismiss it as just a piece of cultural baggage, \"ancient Indian metaphysics,\" that the Buddha retained in deference to the world view of his age. Others interpret it as a metaphor for the change of mental states, with the realms of rebirth seen as symbols for psychological archetypes. A few critics even question the authenticity of the texts on rebirth, arguing that they must be interpolations.<br>A quick glance at the Pali suttas would show that none of these claims has much substance. The teaching of rebirth crops up almost everywhere in the Canon, and is so closely bound to a host of other doctrines that to remove it would virtually reduce the Dhamma to tatters. Moreover, when the suttas speak about rebirth into the five realms \u2014 the hells, the animal world, the spirit realm, the human world, and the heavens \u2014 they never hint that these terms are meant symbolically. To the contrary, they even say that rebirth occurs \"with the breakup of the body, after death,\" which clearly implies they intend the idea of rebirth to be taken quite literally.\"<ref group=web name=\"BB-rebirth\"/>}} [[Thanissaro Bhikkhu]], as another example, rejects the \"modern argument\" that \"one can still obtain all the results of the practice without having to accept the possibility of rebirth.\" He states, \"rebirth has always been a central teaching in the Buddhist tradition.\"<ref group=web name=\"TB_Rebirth\">Thanissaro Bhikkhu, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/truth_of_rebirth.html ''The Truth of Rebirth.

After all, all the factors leading to suffering are all immediately present to awareness, so there should be no need, when trying to abandon them, to accept any premises about where they may or may not lead in the future.<br>This objection, however, ignores the role of appropriate attention on the path. As we noted above, one of its roles is to examine and abandon the assumptions that underlie one's views on the metaphysics of personal identity. Unless you're willing to step back from your own views \u2014 such as those concerning what a person is, and why that makes rebirth impossible \u2014 and subject them to this sort of examination, there's something lacking in your path. You'll remain entangled in the questions of inappropriate attention, which will prevent you from actually identifying and abandoning the causes of suffering and achieving the full results of the practice.<br><br>In addition, the terms of appropriate attention \u2014 the four noble truths \u2014 are not concerned simply with events arising and passing away in the present moment. They also focus on the causal connections among those events, connections that occur both in the immediate present and over time. If you limit your focus solely to connections in the present while ignoring those over time, you can't fully comprehend the ways in which craving causes suffering: not only by latching on to the four kinds of nutriment, but also giving rise to the four kinds of nutriment as well.<ref group=web name=\"TB_Rebirth\"/>}}{{refn|group=note|According to Konik: {{quote|No doubt, according to the early Indian Buddhist tradition, the Buddha's great discovery, as condensed in his experience of nirvana, involved the remembrance of his many former existences, presupposing as fact the reality of a never-ending process of rebirth as a source of deep anxiety, and an acceptance of the Buddha's overcoming of that fate as ultimate liberation.{{sfn|Konik|2009|p=ix}}}}}}\n\nAccording to Owen Flanagan, the Dalai Lama states that \"Buddhists believe in rebirth\" and that this belief has been common among his followers.

The revolutionary system was designed in part to remove all religious and royalist influences from the calendar, and was part of a larger attempt at decimalisation in France (which also included [[decimal time]] of day, [[decimalisation]] of currency, and [[metrication]]). It was used in government records in France and other areas under French rule, including [[Belgium]], [[Luxembourg]], and parts of the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, Malta, and Italy.\n\n== Overview and origins ==\n\n=== Precursor ===\n[[Sylvain Mar\u00e9chal]], prominent anticlerical atheist, published the first edition of his ''Almanach des Honn\u00eates-gens'' (Almanac of Honest People) in 1788.<ref>{{cite web |title=Almanach des Honn\u00eates-gens |pages=14\u201315 |first=Mar\u00e9chal |last=Sylvain |url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k48116c.swf.f3.langFR |website=gallica.bnf.fr |publisher=Gallica}}</ref> On pages 14\u201315 appears a calendar, consisting of twelve months. The first month is \"Mars, ou Princeps\" (March, or First), the last month is \"F\u00e9vrier, ou Duod\u00e9cembre\" (February, or Twelfth). (The months of September [meaning \"the seventh\"] through December [meaning \"the tenth\"] are already numeric names, although their meanings do not match their positions in either the Julian or the Gregorian calendar since the Romans changed the first month of a year from March to January.) The lengths of the months are the same; however, the 10th, 20th, and 30th are singled out of each month as the end of a ''d\u00e9cade'' (group of ten). Individual days were assigned, instead of to the traditional saints, to people noteworthy for mostly secular achievements; 25 December is assigned to both Jesus and Newton.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nLater editions of the almanac would switch to the Republican Calendar.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n=== History ===\n[[File:Musee-historique-lausanne-img 0143.jpg|thumb|A copy of the French Republican Calendar in the Historical Museum of Lausanne]]\nThe days of the [[French Revolution]] and [[French First Republic|Republic]] saw many efforts to sweep away various trappings of the ''[[ancien r\u00e9gime]]'' (the old feudal monarchy); some of these were more successful than others. The new Republican government sought to institute, among other reforms, a new social and legal system, a new system of weights and measures (which became the [[metric system]]), and a new calendar. Amid nostalgia for the ancient [[Roman Republic]], the theories of [[the Enlightenment]] were at their peak, and the devisers of the new systems looked to nature for their inspiration. Natural constants, multiples of ten, and [[Latin]] as well as [[Ancient Greek]] derivations formed the fundamental blocks from which the new systems were built.\n\nThe new calendar was created by a commission under the direction of the politician [[Charles-Gilbert Romme]] seconded by [[Claude Joseph Ferry]] and [[Charles-Fran\u00e7ois Dupuis]]. They associated with their work the chemist [[Louis-Bernard Guyton de Morveau]], the mathematician and astronomer [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]], the astronomer [[Joseph J\u00e9r\u00f4me Lefran\u00e7ois de Lalande]], the mathematician [[Gaspard Monge]], the astronomer and naval geographer [[Alexandre Guy Pingr\u00e9]], and the poet, actor and playwright [[Philippe Fran\u00e7ois Nazaire Fabre d'\u00c9glantine|Fabre d'\u00c9glantine]], who invented the names of the months, with the help of [[Andr\u00e9 Thouin]], gardener at the [[Jardin des Plantes]] of the [[Mus\u00e9um National d'Histoire Naturelle]] in Paris. As the [[rapporteur]] of the commission, Charles-Gilbert Romme presented the new calendar to the [[Jacobin Club|Jacobin]]-controlled [[National Convention]] on 23 September 1793, which adopted it on 24 October 1793 and also extended it [[wikt:proleptic|proleptically]] to its [[epoch (reference date)|epoch]] of 22 September 1792. It is because of his position as rapporteur of the commission that the creation of the republican calendar is attributed to Romme.<ref>[[James Guillaume]], ''Proc\u00e8s-verbaux du Comit\u00e9 d'instruction publique de la Convention nationale'', t. I, pp. 227\u2013228 et t. II, pp. 440\u2013448 ; Michel Froechl\u00e9, \" Le calendrier r\u00e9publicain correspondait-il \u00e0 une n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 scientifique ? \", Congr\u00e8s national des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s savantes : scientifiques et soci\u00e9t\u00e9s, Paris, 1989, pp. 453\u2013465.</ref>\n\nThe calendar is frequently named the \"French Revolutionary Calendar\" because it was created during the Revolution, but this is a slight misnomer. Indeed, there was initially a debate as to whether the calendar should celebrate the Great Revolution, which began in July 1789, or the Republic, which was established in 1792.<ref>{{cite book |title=Le calendrier r\u00e9publicain: de sa cr\u00e9ation \u00e0 sa disparition |date=1994 |publisher=Bureau des longitudes |isbn=978-2-910015-09-1 |page=19}}</ref> Immediately following 14 July 1789, papers and pamphlets started calling 1789 year I of Liberty and the following years II and III. It was in 1792, with the practical problem of dating financial transactions, that the legislative assembly was confronted with the problem of the calendar. Originally, the choice of epoch was either 1 January 1789 or 14 July 1789. After some hesitation the assembly decided on 2 January 1792 that all official documents would use the \"era of Liberty\" and that the year IV of Liberty started on 1 January 1792. This usage was modified on 22 September 1792 when the Republic was proclaimed and the Convention decided that all public documents would be dated Year I of the French Republic. The decree of 2 January 1793 stipulated that the year II of the Republic began on 1 January 1793; this was revoked with the introduction of the new calendar, which set 22 September 1793 as the beginning of year II. The establishment of the Republic was used as the epochal date for the calendar; therefore, the calendar commemorates the Republic, not the Revolution. In France, it is known as the ''calendrier r\u00e9publicain'' as well as the ''calendrier r\u00e9volutionnaire''.\n\nFrench coins of the period naturally used this calendar.  Many show the year ({{lang-fr|an}}) in Arabic numbers, although Roman numerals were used on some issues.  Year 11 coins typically have a \"XI\" date to avoid confusion with the Roman \"II\".\n\nThe French Revolution is usually considered to have ended with the [[coup of 18 Brumaire]], Year VIII (9 November 1799), the [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] of Napoleon Bonaparte against the established constitutional regime of the ''Directoire''.\n\nThe [[Concordat of 1801]] re-established the Roman Catholic Church as an official institution in France, although not as the state religion of France. The concordat took effect from Easter Sunday, 28 Germinal, Year XI (8 April 1802); it restored the names of the days of the week to the ones from the [[Gregorian Calendar]], and fixed Sunday as the official day of rest and religious celebration.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.roi-president.com/bio/bio-fait-Concordat%20de%201801.html |title=Concordat de 1801 Napoleon Bonaparte religion en france Concordat de 1801 |publisher=Roi-president.com |date=21 November 2007 |accessdate=30 January 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120910112012/http://www.roi-president.com/bio/bio-fait-Concordat%20de%201801.html |archivedate=10 September 2012 }}</ref> However, the other attributes of the republican calendar, the months, and years, remained as they were.\n\nThe French Republic ended with the [[coronation of Napoleon I]] as ''Empereur des Fran\u00e7ais'' (Emperor of the French) on 11 Frimaire, Year XIII (2 December 1804), but the republican calendar would remain in place for another year.  [[Napoleon]] finally abolished the republican calendar with effect from 1 January 1806 (the day after 10 Niv\u00f4se Year XIV), a little over twelve years after its introduction. It was, however, used again briefly during the short period of the [[Paris Commune]], 6\u201323 May 1871 (16 Flor\u00e9al\u20133 Prairial Year LXXIX).\n\n=== Calendar design ===\n[[File:French revolutionary date.JPG|thumb|L AN 2 DE LA REPUBLIQUE FR (Year 2 of the French Republic) on a barn near Geneva]]\nYears appear in writing as [[Roman numerals]] (usually), with epoch 22 September 1792, the beginning of the \"Republican Era\" (the day the [[French First Republic]] was proclaimed, one day after the Convention abolished the monarchy). As a result, Roman Numeral I indicates the first year of the republic, that is, the year before the calendar actually came into use. By law, the beginning of each year was set at midnight, beginning on the day the apparent [[September equinox|autumnal equinox]] falls at the Paris Observatory.\n\nThere were twelve months, each divided into three ten-day weeks called ''d\u00e9cades''. The tenth day, ''d\u00e9cadi'', replaced Sunday as the day of rest and festivity. The five or six extra days needed to approximate the solar or [[tropical year]] were placed after the months at the end of each year and called [[Sansculottides|complementary days]]. This arrangement was an almost exact copy of the calendar used by the Ancient Egyptians, though in their case the beginning of the year was marked by summer solstice rather than autumn equinox.\n\nA period of four years ending on a leap day was to be called a \"Franciade\". The name \"[[Olympiad|Olympique]]\" was originally proposed<ref name=\"Rapportsur\">{{cite book |title=Le calendrier r\u00e9publicain: de sa cr\u00e9ation \u00e0 sa disparition |date=1994 |publisher=Bureau des longitudes |isbn=978-2-910015-09-1 |page=26}}</ref> but changed to Franciade to commemorate the fact that it had taken the revolution four years to establish a republican government in France.<ref>{{cite book |title=Le calendrier r\u00e9publicain: de sa cr\u00e9ation \u00e0 sa disparition |date=1994 |publisher=Bureau des longitudes |isbn=978-2-910015-09-1 |page=36}}</ref>\n\nThe leap year was called ''Sextile'', an allusion to the \"[[bissextus|bissextile]]\" [[leap year]]s of the Julian and Gregorian calendars, because it contained a sixth complementary day.\n\n=== Decimal time ===\n{{Main|Decimal time}}\nEach day in the Republican Calendar was divided into ten hours, each hour into 100 decimal minutes, and each decimal minute into 100 decimal seconds. Thus an hour was 144 conventional minutes (more than twice as long as a conventional hour), a minute was 86.4 conventional seconds (44% longer than a conventional minute), and a second was 0.864 conventional seconds (13.6% shorter than a conventional second).\n\n[[Clock]]s were manufactured to display this [[decimal time]], but it did not catch on. Mandatory use of decimal time was officially suspended 7 April 1795, although some cities continued to use decimal time as late as 1801.<ref name=\"Carrigan\">Richard A.

The endings of the names are grouped by season. \"Dor\" means \"giving\" in Greek.<ref name=\"Carlyle\" />\n\nIn Britain, a contemporary wit mocked the Republican Calendar by calling the months: Wheezy, Sneezy and Freezy; Slippy, Drippy and Nippy; Showery, Flowery and Bowery; Hoppy, Croppy and Poppy.<ref>{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pKjhAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA38#v=onepage |title=Clavis Calendaria: Or, A Compendious Analysis of the Calendar; Illustrated with Ecclesiastica, Historical, and Classical Anecdotes |volume=1 |page=38 |year=1812 |publisher=Rogerson and Tuxford}}</ref> The [[Scotland|Scottish]] historian [[Thomas Carlyle]] suggested somewhat more serious English names in his 1837 work ''[[The French Revolution: A History]]'',<ref name=\"Carlyle\">{{cite book |author=Thomas Carlyle |title=The French revolution: a history |url=https://books.google.com/?id=81sQAAAAYAAJ |date=1867 |publisher=Harper |isbn=}}</ref> namely Vintagearious, Fogarious, Frostarious, Snowous, Rainous, Windous, Buddal, Floweral, Meadowal, Reapidor, Heatidor, and Fruitidor.

A. Renouard}}</ref>\n\n== Rural Calendar ==\nThe [[Catholic Church]] used a [[calendar of saints]], which named each day of the year after an associated [[saint]]. To reduce the influence of the Church, [[Fabre d'\u00c9glantine]] introduced a Rural Calendar in which each day of the year had a unique name associated with the rural economy, stated to correspond to the time of year. Every ''d\u00e9cadi'' (ending in 0) was named after an agricultural tool. Each ''quintidi'' (ending in 5) was named for a common animal. The rest of the days were named for \"grain, pasture, trees, roots, flowers, fruits\" and other plants, except for the first month of winter, Niv\u00f4se, during which the rest of the days were named after minerals.<ref>{{cite book |author=Ed.

(...)\n\nAs the calendar is something that we use so often, we must take advantage of this frequency of use to put elementary notions of agriculture before the people \u2013 to show the richness of nature, to make them love the fields, and to methodically show them the order of the influences of the heavens and of the products of the earth.\n\nThe priests assigned the commemoration of a so-called saint to each day of the year: this catalogue exhibited neither utility nor method; it was a collection of lies, of deceit or of charlatanism.\n\nWe thought that the nation, after having kicked out this canonised mob from its calendar, must replace it with the objects that make up the true riches of the nation, worthy objects not from a cult, but from agriculture \u2013 useful products of the soil, the tools that we use to cultivate it, and the domesticated animals, our faithful servants in these works; animals much more precious, without doubt, to the eye of reason, than the beatified skeletons pulled from the catacombs of Rome.\n\nSo we have arranged in the column of each month, the names of the real treasures of the rural economy.  The grains, the pastures, the trees, the roots, the flowers, the fruits, the plants are arranged in the calendar, in such a way that the place and the day of the month that each product occupies is precisely the season and the day that Nature presents it to us.\n| author=Fabre d'\u00c9glantine|title=\"Rapport fait \u00e0 la Convention nationale au nom de la Commission charg\u00e9e de la

After this date, opinions seem to differ on the method by which the leap years would have been determined if the calendar were still in force. There are at least four hypotheses used to convert dates from the Gregorian calendar:\n* ''Equinox:'' The leap years would continue to vary in order to ensure that each year the autumnal equinox in Paris falls on 1 Vend\u00e9miaire, as was the case from year I to year XIV. This is the only method that was ever in legal effect, although it means that sometimes five years pass between leap years, such as the years 15 and 20.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Aec6AAAAcAAJ |title=Concordance de l'Annuaire de la R\u00e9publique fran\u00e7aise avec le calendrier gr\u00e9gorien |author=S\u00e9bastien Louis Rosaz |date=1810}}</ref>\n* ''Romme:'' Leap years would have fallen on each year divisible by four (thus in 20, 24, 28...), except most century years, according to Romme's proposed fixed rules. This would have simplified conversions between the Republican and Gregorian calendars since the Republican leap day would usually follow a few months after 29 February, at the end of each year divisible by four, so that the date of the Republican New Year remains the same (22 September) in the Gregorian calendar for the entire third century of the Republican Era (AD 1992\u20132091).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://prairial.free.fr/calendrier/calendrier.php?lien=discoursromme |title=Brumaire \u2013 Calendrier R\u00e9publicain |publisher=Prairial.free.fr |accessdate=30 January 2009}}</ref>\n* ''Continuous:'' The leap years would have continued in a fixed rule every four years from the last one (thus years 15, 19, 23, 27...) with the leap day added before, rather than after, each year divisible by four, except most century years. This rule has the advantage that it is both simple to calculate and is continuous with every year in which the calendar was in official use during the [[French First Republic|First Republic]]. Some concordances were printed in France, after the Republican Calendar was abandoned, using this rule to determine dates for long-term contracts.<ref>{{cite book |author=Antoine Augustin Renouard |title=Manuel pour la concordance des calendriers r\u00e9publicain et gr\u00e9gorien: ou, Recueil complet de tous les annuaires depuis la premi\u00e8re ann\u00e9e r\u00e9publicaine |url=https://books.google.com/?id=oUoMAAAAIAAJ |edition=2 |date=1822 |publisher=A.

Other methods may differ by one day. Time may be cached and therefore not accurate. Decimal time is according to Paris mean time, which is 9 minutes 21 seconds (6.49 decimal minutes) ahead of Greenwich Mean Time.\n\n{{Republican Calendar}}\n{| style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|}\n\n== Criticism and shortcomings ==\n[[File:Horloge-republicaine1.jpg|thumb|Clock dial displaying both decimal and duodecimal time]]\n[[Leap years]] in the calendar are a point of great dispute, due to the contradicting statements in the establishing decree<ref name=\"gefrance.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.gefrance.com/calrep/decrets.htm |title=Le Calendrier Republicain |publisher=Gefrance.com |accessdate=30 January 2009}}</ref> stating:\n{{quote|Each year begins at midnight, with the day on which the true autumnal equinox falls for the [[Paris Observatory]].}}\nand:\n{{quote|The four-year period, after which the addition of a day is usually necessary, is called the ''Franciade'' in memory of the revolution which, after four years of effort, led France to republican government. The fourth year of the ''Franciade'' is called ''Sextile''.}}\n\nThese two specifications are incompatible, as leap years defined by the autumnal equinox in Paris do not recur on a regular four-year schedule. Thus, the years III, VII, and XI were observed as leap years, and the years XV and XX were also planned as such, even though they were five years apart.\n[[File:Horloge-republicaine2.jpg|thumb|Clock dial displaying both decimal (inside the circle) and duodecimal time (on the outer rim)]]\n\nA fixed arithmetic rule for determining leap years was proposed in the name of the Committee of Public Education by [[Gilbert Romme]] on 19&nbsp;Flor\u00e9al&nbsp;An&nbsp;III (8 May 1795). The proposed rule was to determine leap years by applying the rules of the Gregorian calendar to the years of the French Republic (years IV, VIII, XII, etc. were to be leap years) except that year 4000 (the last year of ten 400-year periods) should be a common year instead of a leap year. Shortly thereafter, he was sentenced to the guillotine, and his proposal was never adopted and the original astronomical rule continued, which excluded any other fixed arithmetic rule. The proposal was intended to avoid uncertain future leap years caused by the inaccurate astronomical knowledge of the 1790s (even today, this statement is still valid due to the uncertainty in [[\u0394T]]). In particular, the committee noted that the autumnal equinox of year 144 was predicted to occur at 11:59:40&nbsp;pm [[local apparent time]] in Paris, which was closer to midnight than its inherent 3 to 4&nbsp;minute uncertainty.\n\nThe calendar was abolished by an act dated 22 Fructidor an XIII (9 September 1805) and signed by [[Napoleon]], which referred to a report by [[Michel-Louis-\u00c9tienne Regnaud de Saint-Jean d'Ang\u00e9ly]] and [[Jean Joseph Mounier]], listing two fundamental flaws.\n# The rule for leap years depended upon the uneven course of the sun, rather than fixed intervals, so that one must consult astronomers to determine when each year started, especially when the equinox happened close to midnight, as the exact moment could not be predicted with certainty.\n# Both the era and the beginning of the year were chosen to commemorate an historical event which occurred on the first day of autumn in France, whereas the other European nations began the year near the beginning of winter or spring, thus being impediments to the calendar's adoption in Europe and America, and even a part of the French nation, where the Gregorian calendar continued to be used, as it was required for religious purposes.\nThe report also noted that the 10-day d\u00e9cade was unpopular and had already been suppressed three years earlier in favor of the 7-day week, removing what was considered by some as one of the calendar's main benefits.<ref>{{cite book |author=Antoine Augustin Renouard |title=Manuel pour la concordance des calendriers r\u00e9publicain et gr\u00e9gorien: ou, Recueil complet de tous les annuaires depuis la premi\u00e8re ann\u00e9e r\u00e9publicaine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oUoMAAAAIAAJ |edition=2 |date=1822 |publisher=A.

It also, by design, conflicted with Sunday religious observances.\n\nAnother criticism of the calendar was that despite the poetic names of its months, they are tied to the climate and agriculture of [[metropolitan France]] and therefore not applicable to [[Overseas departments and territories of France|France's overseas territories]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Esoteric Codex: Obsolete Calendars |last=Canes |first=Kermit |publisher=LULU Press |year=2012 |isbn=1-365-06556-1 |location= |pages= |quote= |via=}}</ref>\n\n== Famous dates and other cultural references ==\n{{original research|section|date=October 2017}}\n{{See also|Glossary of the French Revolution#Events commonly known by their Revolutionary dates}}\n[[File:Ecole normale sup\u00e9rieure 2.JPG|thumb|''D\u00e9cret de la Convention 9 Brumaire An III'' above the entrance to the [[\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure|ENS]]]]\nThe \"[[18 Brumaire]]\" or \"Brumaire\" was the [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] on 18 Brumaire An VIII (9 November 1799), which many historians consider as the end of the French Revolution.

Dyson recognized the formula as the [[pair correlation function]] of the [[Gaussian unitary ensemble]], which has been extensively studied by physicists.

This was first propounded by the Russian [[Alexander Oparin]].<ref>Oparin, A. I. ''The Origin of Life'', Moscow Worker publisher, 1924 (Russian)</ref> [[J. B. S. Haldane]] developed the same theory independently.<ref>''The Origin of Life'', J.B.S.Haldane, The Rationalist Annual, 1929</ref> Dyson has simplified things by saying simply that life evolved in two stages, widely separated in time. He regards it as too unlikely that genes could have developed fully blown in one process, because of the biochemistry. Current cells contain [[adenosine triphosphate]] or ATP and [[adenosine 5'-monophosphate]] or AMP, which greatly resemble each other but have completely different functions. ATP transports energy around the cell, and AMP is part of RNA and the genetic apparatus. Dyson proposes that in a primitive early cell containing ATP and AMP, RNA and replication were invented accidentally because of the similarity between AMP and RNA. He suggests that AMP was produced when ATP molecules lost two of their phosphate radicals, and then one cell somewhere performed [[Manfred Eigen|Eigen]]'s experiment and produced RNA.\n\nUnfortunately there is no direct evidence for the dual origin concept, because once genes developed, they took over, obliterating all traces of the earlier forms of life. In the first origin, the cells were probably just drops of water held together by surface tension, teeming with enzymes and chemical reactions, and a primitive kind of growth or replication. When the liquid drop became too big, it split into two drops. Many complex molecules formed in these \"little city economies\" and the probability that genes would eventually develop in them was much greater than in the prebiotic environment.<ref>Freeman Dyson, ''Origins of Life,,.

Eventually, the civilization would completely enclose the star, intercepting [[electromagnetic radiation]] with wavelengths from visible light downwards and radiating waste heat outwards as [[infrared]] radiation.

If Montgomery had not been visiting the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] that week, this connection might not have been discovered.\n\nThere are in nature one, two, and three dimensional [[quasicrystals]]. Mathematicians define a quasicrystal as a set of discrete points whose [[Fourier transform]] is also a set of discrete points.

It is necessary to be afraid, but it is equally necessary to understand. And the first step in understanding is to recognize that the problem of nuclear war is basically not technical but human and historical. If we are to avoid destruction we must first of all understand the human and historical context out of which destruction arises.<ref>Dyson, F.J. (1984) ''Weapons and Hope''</ref>}}\n\nIn 1967, in his capacity as a military adviser Dyson wrote an influential paper on the issue of possible US use of tactical nuclear weapons in the [[Vietnam War]]. When a general said in a meeting, \"I think it might be a good idea to throw in a nuke now and then, just to keep the other side guessing ...\"<ref>{{harvp|Dyson, F.J.|1979}}. \"The Ethics of Defense\" in ''Disturbing the Universe'', p. 149.</ref> Dyson became alarmed and obtained permission to write an objective report discussing the pros and cons of using such weapons from a purely military point of view. (This report, ''Tactical Nuclear Weapons in Southeast Asia'', published by the [[Institute for Defense Analyses]], was obtained, with some redactions, by the [[Nautilus Institute for Security and Sustainability]] under the [[Freedom of Information act]] in 2002.)<ref>F.J. Dyson, R. Gomer, S. Weinberg, S.C.

Dyson says that the report showed that, even from a narrow military point of view, the US was better off not using nuclear weapons. Dyson stated on the [[Dick Cavett show]] that the use of nuclear weaponry was a bad idea for the US at the time because \"our targets were large and theirs were small.\" (His unstated assumption was that the Soviets would respond by supplying tactical nukes to the other side.)\n\nDyson opposed the [[Vietnam War]], the [[Gulf War]] and the [[invasion of Iraq]]. He supported [[Barack Obama]] in the [[2008 US presidential election]] and ''[[The New York Times]]'' has described him as a [[Modern liberalism in the United States|political liberal]].<ref name=civil /> He was one of 29 leading US scientists who wrote a strongly supportive letter to Obama regarding his administration's 2015 nuclear deal with Iran.<ref name = \"29 support letter\">{{Cite web | last = Broad | first = William J. | date = 8 August 2015 | title = 29 U.S. Scientists Praise Iran Nuclear Deal in Letter to Obama | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/09/world/29-us-scientists-praise-iran-nuclear-deal-in-letter-to-obama.html | work = The New York Times | access-date = 9 August 2015 }}</ref>\n\n===Civil defence===\nWhile teaching for a few weeks in Zurich, Dyson was visited by two officials from the Swiss civil defence authority. Their experts were telling them that fairly simple shelters on a large scale would enable them to survive a nuclear attack, and they wanted confirmation. They knew that Dyson had a security clearance. Dyson reassured them that their shelters would do the job. The US does not build such shelters because it would be contrary to the doctrine of [[mutual assured destruction]], since the US would be able to launch a first strike but survive retaliation.<ref>Dyson, F.J.

In England there were always two sharply opposed middle classes, the academic middle class and the commercial middle class. In the nineteenth century, the academic middle class won the battle for power and status.  As a child of the academic middle class, I learned to look on the commercial middle class with loathing and contempt.  Then came the triumph of [[Margaret Thatcher]], which was also the revenge of the commercial middle class.  The academics lost their power and prestige and the business people took over.

And both are worthy of respect.\n\nTrouble arises when either science or religion claims universal jurisdiction, when either religious or scientific dogma claims to be infallible. Religious creationists and scientific materialists are equally dogmatic and insensitive. By their arrogance they bring both science and religion into disrepute.

When the Pharisees asked his disciples, \"Why eateth your Master with publicans and sinners?\" he said, \"I come to call not the righteous but sinners to repentance.\" Only a small fraction of sinners repent and do good things but only a small fraction of good people are led by their religion to do bad things.<ref name=\"nyrb06.html\" />}}\n\nWhile Dyson has labeled himself a Christian, he identifies himself as agnostic about some of the specifics of his faith.<ref>{{cite book |title=Back to Hell |publisher=Xulon Press |isbn=9781591608158 |author=Moses Gbenu |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R8aLHpyW7vEC&pg=PA110#v=onepage&q&f=false |page=110 |quote=The cash part of this award is over $1 million.

I have no use for a theology that claims to know the answers to deep questions but bases its arguments on the beliefs of a single tribe. I am a practicing Christian but not a believing Christian.

Other large rivers include the upper [[Werra]] in Thuringia and the [[Tauber]], as well as the upper [[Jagst]] and [[Kocher]] streams in the west, both right tributaries of the [[Neckar]]. In southern Middle Franconia, the [[Altm\u00fchl]] flows towards the [[Danube]]; the [[Rhine\u2013Main\u2013Danube Canal]] crosses the [[European Watershed]]. The man-made [[Franconian Lake District]] has become a popular destination for day-trippers and tourists.\n\nThe landscape is characterized by numerous ''[[Mittelgebirge]]'' ranges of the German [[Central Uplands]]. The Western natural border of Franconia is formed by the [[Spessart]] and [[Rh\u00f6n Mountains]], separating it from the former [[Rhenish Franconia]]n lands around [[Aschaffenburg]] (officially part of Lower Franconia), whose inhabitants speak [[Hessian dialects]]. To the north rise the [[Rennsteig]] ridge of the [[Thuringian Forest]], the [[Thuringian Highland]] and the [[Franconian Forest]], the border with the [[Upper Saxony|Upper Saxon]] lands of [[Thuringia]]. The Franconian lands include the present-day South Thuringian districts of [[Schmalkalden-Meiningen]], [[Hildburghausen (district)|Hildburghausen]] and [[Sonneberg (district)|Sonneberg]], the historical ''[[Gau (country subdivision)|Gau]]'' of [[Grabfeld]], held by the [[House of Henneberg]] from the 11th century and later part of the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] duchy of [[Saxe-Meiningen]].\n\nIn the east, the [[Fichtel Mountains]] lead to [[Vogtland]], Bohemian [[Egerland]] (''Chebsko'') in the [[Czech Republic]], and the Bavarian [[Upper Palatinate]]. The hills of the [[Franconian Jura]] in the south mark the border with the [[Upper Bavaria]]n region (''[[Altbayern]]''), historical [[Swabia]], and the Danube basin. The northern parts of the Upper Bavarian [[Eichst\u00e4tt (district)|Eichst\u00e4tt District]], territory of the historical [[Bishopric of Eichst\u00e4tt]], are also counted as part of Franconia.\n\nIn the west, Franconia proper comprises the [[Tauber Franconia]] region along the Tauber river, which {{as of | 2014 | lc - on}} is largely part of the [[Main-Tauber-Kreis]] in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg.

In the city of [[Heilbronn]], beyond the [[Haller Ebene]] plateau, [[South Franconian German|South Franconian]] dialects are spoken. Furthermore, in those easternmost parts of the [[Neckar-Odenwald-Kreis]] which had formerly belonged to the [[Bishopric of W\u00fcrzburg]], the inhabitants have preserved their Franconian identity.

Though located on the southeastern periphery of the area, the Nuremberg metropolitan area is often identified as the economic and cultural centre of Franconia. Further cities in Bavarian Franconia include [[F\u00fcrth]], [[Erlangen]], [[Bayreuth]], [[Bamberg]], [[Aschaffenburg]], [[Schweinfurt]], [[Hof, Bavaria|Hof]], [[Coburg]], [[Ansbach]] and [[Schwabach]].

The largest part of Franconia, both by population and area, belongs to the Free State of Bavaria and is divided into the three provinces (''Regierungsbezirke'') of [[Middle Franconia]] (capital: [[Ansbach]]), [[Upper Franconia]] (capital: [[Bayreuth]]) and [[Lower Franconia]] (capital: [[W\u00fcrzburg]]). The name of these provinces, as in the case of [[Upper Bavaria|Upper]] and [[Lower Bavaria]], refers to their situation with respect to the [[River Main]]. Thus Upper Franconia lies on the upper reaches of the river, Lower Franconia on its lower reaches and Middle Franconia lies in between, although the Main itself does not flow through Middle Franconia. Where the boundaries of these three provinces meet (the '[[tripoint]]') is the ''[[Dreifrankenstein]]'' (\"Three Franconias Rock\").<ref>\n[http://dreifrankenstein.de/geschichte.htm ''Dreifrankenstein''] {{Webarchive\n |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160322211734/http://dreifrankenstein.de/geschichte.htm\n |date= 2016-03-22\n}}, retrieved 12 July 2014.\n</ref>\nSmall parts of Franconia also belong to the Bavarian provinces of [[Upper Palatinate]] and [[Upper Bavaria]].\n\nThe Franconian territories of [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]] are the regions of [[Tauber Franconia]] and [[Hohenlohe]] (which belong to the [[Heilbronn-Franconia Region]] with its office in Heilbronn and form part of the [[Stuttgart Region]]) and the area around the Badenian [[Buchen (Odenwald)|Buchen]] in the [[Rhine-Neckar| Rhein-Neckar Region]].\n\nThe Franconian parts of Thuringia ([[Henneberg Franconia]]) lie within the Southwest Thuringia Planning Region.\n\nThe Franconian regions in Hesse form the smaller parts of the counties of [[Fulda (district)|Fulda]] ([[Kassel province]]) and the [[Odenwaldkreis]] ([[Darmstadt province]]), or lie on the borders with Bavaria or Thuringia.\n\n=== Rivers and lakes ===\n[[File:Brombach luft.jpg|thumb|The lake of [[Gro\u00dfer Brombachsee]]. View over [[Ramsberg am Brombachsee|Ramsberg]] looking east towards the dam]]\nThe two most important rivers of the region are the [[River Main|Main]] and its primary tributary, the [[Regnitz]]. The tributaries of these two rivers in Franconia are the [[Tauber]], [[Pegnitz (river)|Pegnitz]], [[Rednitz]] and [[Franconian Saale]]. Other major rivers in the region are the [[Jagst]] and [[Kocher (river)|Kocher]] in Hohenlohe-Franconia, which empty into the [[Neckar]] north of Heilbronn in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, the [[Altm\u00fchl]] and the [[W\u00f6rnitz]] in Middle Franconia, both tributaries of the [[Danube]], and the upper and middle reaches of the [[Werra]], the right-hand headstream of the [[Weser]]. In the northeast of Upper Franconia rise two left-hand tributaries of the [[Elbe]]: the [[Saxon Saale]] and the [[Eger (Elbe)|Eger]].\n\nThe [[Main-Danube Canal]] connects the Main and Danube across Franconia, running from Bamberg via Nuremberg to [[Kelheim]]. It thus complements the Rhine, Main and Danube, helping to ensure a continuous navigable waterway between the [[North Sea]] and the [[Black Sea]]. In Franconia, there are only a few, often very small, natural [[lake]]s. This is due to fact that most natural lakes in Germany are [[glacial lake|glacial]] or [[volcanism|volcanic]] in origin, and Franconia escaped both influences in recent earth history. Among the largest waterbodies are [[reservoir]]s, which are mostly used as water reserves for the relatively dry landscapes of Franconia. These includes the waters of the [[Franconian Lake District]], which was established in the 1970s and is also a tourist attraction. The heart of these lakes is the [[Gro\u00dfer Brombachsee]], which has an area of 8.7&nbsp;km\u00b2 and is thus the largest waterbody in Franconia by surface area.\n\n=== Hills, mountains and plains ===\nSeveral [[Central Upland]] ranges dominate the Franconian countryside. In the southeast,Franconia is shielded from the rest of Bavaria by the [[Franconian Jura]]. In the east, the [[Fichtel Mountains]] form the border; in the north are [[Franconian Forest]], the [[Thuringian Forest]], the [[Rh\u00f6n Mountains]] and the [[Spessart]] form a kind of natural barrier. To the west are the [[Franconian Heights]] and the [[Swabian-Franconian Forest]]. In the Franconian part of South Hesse is the [[Odenwald]]. Parts of the southern [[Thuringian Forest]] border on Franconia. The most important hill ranges in the interior of the region are the [[Steigerwald]] and the Franconian Jura with their sub-ranges of [[Hahnenkamm (Altm\u00fchltal)|Hahnenkamm]] and [[Franconian Switzerland]]. The highest mountain in Franconia is the [[Schneeberg (Fichtel Mountains)|Schneeberg]] in the Fichtel Mountains which is {{H\u00f6he|1051|DE-NHN|link=true}}.<ref name=\"geoquelle\" /> Other well-known mountains include the [[Ochsenkopf (Fichtel Mountains)|Ochsenkopf]] (1,024m<ref name=\"geoquelle\">Source: the [[BfN]] map</ref>), the [[Kreuzberg (Rh\u00f6n)|Kreuzberg]] (927.8m<ref name=\"geoquelle\" />) and the [[Hesselberg]] (689.4m<ref name=\"geoquelle\" />). The [[inliers and outliers (geology)|outliers]] of the region include the Hesselberg and the [[Gleichberge]]. The lowest point in Franconia is the water level of the River Main in [[Kahl am Main|Kahl]] which lies at a height of 100 metres above sea level.\n\nIn addition to the hill and mountain ranges, there are also several very level areas, including the [[Middle Franconian Basin]] and the [[Hohenlohe Plain]]. In the south of Franconia are smaller parts of the flat [[N\u00f6rdlinger Ries]], one of the best preserved impact craters on earth.\n\n=== Forests, reserves, flora and fauna ===\n[[File:Steinerne Rinne.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Steinerne Rinne]] near Rohrbach, [[Ettenstatt]], county of [[Wei\u00dfenburg-Gunzenhausen]]]]\nFranconia's flora is dominated by deciduous and coniferous forests. Natural forests in Franconia occur mainly in the ranges of the Spessart, Franconian Forest, Odenwald and Steigerwald. The Nuremberg ''Reichswald'' is another great [[forest]], located within the metropolitan region of Nuremberg. Other large areas of forest in the region are the [[M\u00f6nchswald]], the [[Reichsforst (Fichtel)|Reichsforst]] in the Fichtel Mountains and the [[Selb Forest]]. In the river valleys along the Main and Tauber, the countryside was developed for viticulture. In Spessart there are great oak forests. Also widespread are [[calcareous grassland]]s, extensively used [[pasture]]s on very [[Nutrient (plant)|oligotrophic]], poor sites. In particular, the southern [[Franconian Jura]], with the [[Altm\u00fchl Valley]], is characterized by poor grassland of this type. Many of these places have been designated as a [[protected area]]s.\n\nFranconia has several regions with sandy habitats that are unique for south Germany and are protected as the so-called Sand Belt of Franconia or ''[[Sandachse Franken]]''.<ref>[http://www.sandachse.de/Sandwege.html ''Sandwege''], Sandachse Franken, retrieved 23 May 2014</ref> When the [[Altm\u00fchlsee]] reservoir was built, a bird island was created and designated as a nature reserve where a variety of birds nest.

After the dissolution of the so-called [[Stem duchy]] of Franconia, the [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman Emperors]] created the [[Franconian Circle]] (German ''Fr\u00e4nkischer Reichskreis'') in 1500 to embrace the principalities that grew out of the eastern half of the former duchy. The territory of the Franconian Circle roughly corresponds with modern Franconia. The title of a ''Duke of [[Duchy of Franconia|Franconia]]'' was claimed by the [[Bishopric of W\u00fcrzburg|W\u00fcrzburg bishops]] until 1803 and by the kings of [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavaria]] until 1918.<ref>Gerhard K\u00f6bler, Historisches Lexikon der deutschen L\u00e4nder, Darmstadt 1999, pp. 173\u2013174</ref> Examples of Franconian cities founded by Frankish noblemen are [[W\u00fcrzburg]], first mentioned in the 7th century, [[Ansbach]], first mentioned in 748, and [[Wei\u00dfenburg in Bayern|Weissenburg]], founded in the 7th century.<ref>Gerhard K\u00f6bler, Historisches Lexikon der deutschen L\u00e4nder, Darmstadt 1999</ref>\n\n=== Early history and Antiquity ===\n[[File:Staffelberg 2006-05-07.jpg|thumb|The [[Celts]] built the mighty fortress of [[Menosgada]] on the [[Staffelberg]]]]\nFossil finds show that the region was already settled by [[Caveman|primitive man]], ''[[Homo erectus]]'', in the middle [[Ice Age]] about 600,000&nbsp;years ago.

It extended as far west as [[Speyer]], [[Mainz]], and [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] (west of the [[Rhine]]) and even included [[Frankfurt]] (\"ford of the Franks\"). In the early 10th century, the [[Babenbergs]] and [[Conradines]] fought for power in Franconia. Ultimately this discord led to the [[Babenberg Feud]] which was fuelled and controlled by the crown. The outcome of this feud meant the loss of power for the Babenbergs, but indirectly resulted in the Conradines winning the crown of East Francia. Sometime around 906, [[Conrad I of Germany|Conrad]] succeeded in establishing his ducal hegemony over Franconia, but when the direct Carolingian male line failed in 911, Conrad was acclaimed [[List of German Kings and Emperors|King of the Germans]], largely because of his weak position in his own duchy. Franconia, like [[Alamannia]] was fairly fragmented and the duke's position was often disputed between the chief families. Conrad had granted Franconia to his brother [[Eberhard of Franconia|Eberhard]] on his succession, but when Eberhard rebelled against [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]] in 938, he was deposed from his duchy, which disintegrated in 939 on Eberhard's death into West or [[Rhenish Franconia]] (''{{lang|la|Francia Rhenensis}}''), and East Franconia (''{{lang|la|Francia Orientalis}}'')<ref group=\"note\">East Franconia should not be confused with the eastern division of the Frankish Empire, [[East Francia]], which was also known as ''{{lang|la|Francia Orientalis}}'' in Latin.

The FileMan utilities allow the definition of data structures, menus and security, reports, and forms, allowing someone to set up applications without tremendous experience in the MUMPS programming language.\n\nFileMan was designed to support the complex information storage and processing needs of hospitals.  It was based on an active data dictionary that was able to invoke the full interpretive power of the MUMPS language from within a data reference.  For example, a field called \"Length of Stay\" could invoke a MUMPS expression that would process the various dates, transfers, and discharges that would then be returned as if it were stored as a fixed data element.\n\nMUMPS differs from many languages in its handling of the null string.  A large percentage of the FileMan internal data structures are null strings, in which the information is located in the name of the \"nothing\" being referenced.  This approach does not fit the traditional [[Relational data model|Relational Data Model]].\n\nIts first use was in the development of medical applications for the Veterans Administration, now called the Department of Veterans Affairs, a branch of the [[United States]] Government.\nSince it was a work created by the US federal government, a copyright cannot be placed on the source code, making the source code in the public domain.

Such requests are made most often by the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI).

The court may allow third parties to submit briefs as ''[[amicus curiae|amici curiae]]''. When the [[United States Attorney General|U.S. Attorney General]] determines that an emergency exists, the Attorney General may authorize the emergency employment of electronic surveillance before obtaining the necessary authorization from the FISC, if the Attorney General or their designee notifies a judge of the court at the time of authorization and applies for a warrant as soon as practicable but not more than seven days after authorization of such surveillance, as required by {{USC|50|1805}}.\n\nIf an application is denied by one judge of the court, the federal government is not allowed to make the same application to a different judge of the court, but may appeal to the [[United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review]]. Such appeals are rare: the first appeal from the FISC to the Court of Review was made in 2002 (''[[In re Sealed Case No. 02-001]]''), 24 years after the founding of the court.\n\nAlso rare is for FISA warrant requests to be turned down. During the 25 years from 1979 to 2004, <!--not a typo-->18,742 warrants were granted, while only four were rejected. Fewer than 200 requests had to be modified before being accepted, almost all of them in 2003 and 2004. The four rejected requests were all from 2003, and all four were partially granted after being submitted for reconsideration by the government. Of the requests that had to be modified, few were before the year 2000. During the next eight years, from 2004 to 2012, there were over 15,100 additional warrants granted, and another seven being rejected. Over the entire 33-year period, the FISA court granted 33,942 warrants, with only 12 denials \u2013 a rejection rate of 0.03 percent of the total requests.<ref name=WSJ2012Stats>{{subscription required|date=July 2013}} {{cite news |last=Evan |first=Perez |title=Secret Court's Oversight Gets Scrutiny |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324904004578535670310514616 |accessdate=June 20, 2013 |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=June 9, 2013}}</ref> This does not include the number of warrants that were modified by the FISA court.<ref>Harwood, Matthew. \"The Terrifying Surveillance Case of Brandon Mayfield | Al Jazeera America.\" The Terrifying Surveillance Case of Brandon Mayfield | Al Jazeera America.

The searches take place under a surveillance program Congress authorized in 2008 under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Under that law, the target must be a foreigner \"reasonably believed\" to be outside the United States, and the court must approve the targeting procedures in an order good for one year. But a warrant for each target would thus no longer be required. That means that communications with Americans could be picked up without a court first determining that there is probable cause that the people they were talking to were terrorists, spies or \"foreign powers\". The FISC also extended the length of time that the NSA is allowed to retain intercepted U.S. communications from five years to six years with an extension possible for foreign intelligence or counterintelligence purposes. Both measures were done without public debate or any specific authority from Congress.<ref>{{cite news |last=Nakashima |first=Ellen |title=Obama administration had restrictions on NSA reversed in 2011 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/obama-administration-had-restrictions-on-nsa-reversed-in-2011/2013/09/07/c26ef658-0fe5-11e3-85b6-d27422650fd5_print.html |accessdate=February 3, 2014 |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=September 8, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Secrecy==\nBecause of the sensitive nature of its business, the court is a \"secret court\" \u2013 its hearings are closed to the public.

It offers no real safeguards. That's because no court monitors what the NSA is actually doing when it claims to comply with the court-approved procedures. Once the Fisa court puts its approval stamp on the NSA's procedures, there is no external judicial check on which targets end up being selected by the NSA analysts for eavesdropping. The only time individualized warrants are required is when the NSA is specifically targeting a US citizen or the communications are purely domestic. When it is time for the NSA to obtain Fisa court approval, the agency does not tell the court whose calls and emails it intends to intercept. It instead merely provides the general guidelines which it claims are used by its analysts to determine which individuals they can target, and the Fisa court judge then issues a simple order approving those guidelines. The court endorses a one-paragraph form order stating that the NSA's process {{\"'}}contains all the required elements' and that the revised NSA, FBI and CIA minimization procedures submitted with the amendment 'are consistent with the requirements of [50 U.S.C. \u00a7&nbsp;1881a(e)] and with the fourth amendment to the Constitution of the United States{{'\"}}. As but one typical example, ''The Guardian'' has obtained an August 19, 2010, Fisa court approval from Judge [[John D. Bates]] which does nothing more than recite the statutory language in approving the NSA's guidelines.\n\nOnce the NSA has this court approval, it can then target anyone chosen by their analysts, and can even order telecoms and internet companies to turn over to them the emails, chats and calls of those they target. The Fisa court plays no role whatsoever in reviewing whether the procedures it approved are actually complied with when the NSA starts eavesdropping on calls and reading people's emails. The guidelines submitted by the NSA to the Fisa court demonstrate how much discretion the agency has in choosing who will be targeted.  ... The only oversight for monitoring whether there is abuse comes from the executive branch itself: from the DOJ and Director of National Intelligence, which conduct \"periodic reviews  ... to evaluate the implementation of the procedure\". At a hearing before the House Intelligence Committee Tuesday afternoon, deputy attorney general [[James M. Cole|James Cole]] testified that every 30 days, the Fisa court is merely given an \"aggregate number\" of database searches on US domestic phone records.  ... The decisions about who has their emails and telephone calls intercepted by the NSA is made by the NSA itself, not by the Fisa court, except where the NSA itself concludes the person is a US citizen and/or the communication is exclusively domestic.

It reported that anyone suspected of being involved in nuclear proliferation, espionage or cyber-attacks, according to the court, may be considered a legitimate target for warrantless surveillance.

The special needs doctrine was originally established in 1989 by the Supreme Court in a [[Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives Association|ruling]] allowing the drug testing of railway workers, finding that a minimal intrusion on privacy was justified by the government's need to combat an overriding public danger. Applying that concept more broadly, the FISA judges have ruled that the N.S.A.'s collection and examination of Americans' communications data to track possible terrorists does not run afoul of the Fourth Amendment, the officials said. That legal interpretation is significant, several outside legal experts said, because it uses a relatively narrow area of the law{{spaced ndash}} used to justify airport screenings, for instance, or drunken-driving checkpoints{{spaced ndash}} and applies it much more broadly, in secret, to the wholesale collection of communications in pursuit of terrorism suspects.<ref name=\"NYT broaden\" />}}\n\nThe \"special-needs\" doctrine is an exemption to the Fourth Amendment's Warrants Clause which commands that \"no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be and seized\". The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized an exemption to the Warrants Clause \"outside the foreign intelligence context, in so-called 'special-needs' cases.

Stone, a professor of constitutional law at the [[University of Chicago]], said he was troubled by the idea that the court is creating a significant body of law without hearing from anyone outside the government, forgoing the adversarial system that is a staple of the American justice system. He said, \"That whole notion is missing in this process\".<ref name=\"NYT broaden\" />\n\nThe court concluded that mass collection of telephone [[metadata]] (including the time of phone calls and numbers dialed) does not violate the Fourth Amendment as long as the government establishes a valid reason under national security regulations before taking the next step of actually examining the contents of an American's communications. This concept is rooted partly in the special needs doctrine. \"The basic idea is that it's O.K. to create this huge pond of data\", an unnamed U.S. official said, \"but you have to establish a reason to stick your pole in the water and start fishing\".<ref name=\"NYT broaden\" /> Under the new procedures passed by the U.S. Congress in the [[FISA Amendments Act of 2008]], even the collection of metadata must be considered \"relevant\" to a terrorism investigation or other intelligence activities.

The history of the word \"relevant\" is key to understanding that passage. The Supreme Court in 1991 said things are \"relevant\" if there is a \"reasonable possibility\" that they will produce information related to the subject of the investigation. In criminal cases, courts previously have found that very large sets of information did not meet the relevance standard because significant portions{{spaced ndash}} innocent people's information{{spaced ndash}} would not be pertinent. But the court has developed separate precedents, centered on the idea that investigations to prevent national-security threats are different from ordinary criminal cases. The court's rulings on such matters are classified and almost impossible to challenge because of the secret nature of the proceedings. According to the court, the special nature of national-security and terrorism-prevention cases means \"relevant\" can have a broader meaning for those investigations, say people familiar with the rulings.<ref name=\"WSJ20130708\" />\n\nPeople familiar with the system that uses phone records in investigations have said that the court's novel legal theories allow the system to include bulk phone records, as long as there are privacy safeguards to limit searches. NSA analysts may query the database only \"when there is a reasonable suspicion, based on specific facts, that the particular basis for the query is associated with a foreign terrorist organization\", according to [[Director of National Intelligence]] [[James Clapper]].<ref name=\"WSJ20130708\" /> The NSA database includes data about people's phone calls{{spaced ndash}} numbers dialed, how long a call lasted{{spaced ndash}} but not the actual conversations.

Since the entire skin on the inner walls of the labia majora has to be removed all the way down to the perineum, this becomes a messy business. By now, the child is screaming, struggling, and bleeding profusely, which makes it difficult for the circumciser to hold with bare fingers and nails the slippery skin and parts that are to be cut or sutured together.&nbsp;...\n\nHaving ensured that sufficient tissue has been removed to allow the desired fusion of the skin, the circumciser pulls together the opposite sides of the labia majora, ensuring that the raw edges where the skin has been removed are well approximated. The wound is now ready to be stitched or for thorns to be applied. If a needle and thread are being used, close tight sutures will be placed to ensure that a flap of skin covers the vulva and extends from the mons veneris to the perineum, and which, after the wound heals, will form a bridge of scar tissue that will totally occlude the vaginal introitus.<ref name=Ismail2016p12>{{harvnb|Ismail|2016|loc=12}}.</ref></blockquote>\n\n{{quote box\n|border=1px\n|title=External images\n|title_fnt=#555555\n|halign=left\n|quote={{plainlist}}\n* [https://smw.ch/resource/jf/jimg/780/780/ratio/journal/file/view/article/smw/en/smw.2011.13137/smw_2011_13137_fig_01_conv.jpg/ Type IIIb (virgin)]\n* [https://smw.ch/resource/jf/jimg/780/780/ratio/journal/file/view/article/smw/en/smw.2011.13137/smw_2011_13137_fig_02_conv.jpg/ Type IIIb (sexually active)]\n{{endplainlist}}\n|qalign=center\n|fontsize=95%\n|bgcolor=#F9F9F9\n|bordercolor=#ccc\n|width=220px\n|align=right\n|salign=right\n|style=margin\u2013top:1.5em;margin-bottom:1.5em;padding:1em\n|source= \u2014 ''[[Swiss Medical Weekly]]''{{sfn|Abdulcadir|Margairaz|Boulvain|Irion|2011}}}}\nThe amputated parts might be placed in a pouch for the girl to wear.{{sfn|El Guindi|2007|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8VQxt634pfcC&pg=PA43 43]}} A single hole of 2\u20133&nbsp;mm is left for the passage of urine and menstrual fluid.{{efn|Jasmine Abdulcadir (''Swiss Medical Weekly'', 2011): \"In the case of infibulation, the urethral opening and part of the vaginal opening are covered by the scar.

Wishing to assemble written lawcodes for all his subject peoples, [[Charlemagne]] summoned twelve representatives of the Frisian people, the ''[[Asega|\u0100sega]]s'' ('law-speakers'), and demanded they recite their people's laws. When they could not do so after several days, he let them choose between death, slavery, or being set adrift in a rudderless boat.

He is best known for being the 99th [[Mayor of New York City]] for three terms from 1934 to 1945 as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]. Previously he had been elected to [[United States Congress|Congress]] in 1916 and 1918, and again from 1922 through 1930. Irascible, energetic, and charismatic, he craved publicity and is acclaimed as one of the greatest mayors in American history.<ref>He was ranked first in Melvin G. Holli, ''The American Mayor'' (1993)</ref> Only five feet, two inches (1.57 m) tall, he was called \"the Little Flower\" (''{{lang|it|Fiorello}}'' is Italian for \"little flower\").\n\nLa Guardia, a Republican who appealed across party lines, was very popular in New York during the 1930s. As a [[New Deal]]er, he supported President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], a Democrat, and in turn Roosevelt heavily funded the city and cut off patronage for La Guardia's enemies. La Guardia revitalized New York City and restored public faith in City Hall. He unified the transit system, directed the building of low-cost public housing, public playgrounds, and parks, constructed airports, reorganized the police force, defeated the powerful [[Tammany Hall]] [[political machine]], and reestablished employment on merit in place of patronage jobs.<ref name=\"Thomas Kessner 1989\">{{cite book |first=Thomas |last=Kessner |title=Fiorello H.

He won elections against the historically corrupt [[Tammany Hall]] political system, presided during the [[Great Depression]] and [[World War II]], implemented [[New Deal]] welfare and public works programs in the city, and gave political support to immigrants and ethnic minorities. He was also supported by President Roosevelt. La Guardia was known as a reform mayor who helped clean out corruption, brought in experts, and made the city responsible for its own citizens. His administration engaged new groups that had been kept out of the political system, gave New York its modern infrastructure, and raised expectations of new levels of urban possibility.\n\n==Early life and career==\nLa Guardia was born in [[Greenwich Village]] in [[New York City]]. His father, Achille La Guardia, was a [[lapsed Catholic]] from [[Cerignola]], Italy, and his mother, Irene Coen, was a [[Jewish]] woman from [[Trieste]], then part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]; his maternal grandmother Fiorina Luzzatto Coen was a [[Luzzatto]], a member of the prestigious Italian-Jewish family of scholars, kabbalists, and poets and had among her ancestors the famous rabbi [[Samuel David Luzzatto]]. It was in Trieste that Achille La Guardia met and married Irene.<ref name=IlPiccolo /> Fiorello La Guardia was raised an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalian]] and practiced that religion all his life. His middle name \"Enrico\" was anglicized to \"Henry\" when he was a child.\n\nHe moved to [[Arizona]] with his family, where his father had a [[bandmaster]] position at [[Fort Whipple, Arizona|Fort Whipple]] in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]]. La Guardia attended public schools and high school in [[Prescott, Arizona]].<ref name=\"CONGRESSBIO\">{{CongBio| L000007| name=LA GUARDIA, Fiorello Henry|inline=1}} from the [[Biographical Directory of the United States Congress]]</ref> After his father was discharged from his bandmaster position in 1898, Fiorello lived in [[Trieste]].<ref>For one biographical account about Achille La Guardia, see {{cite web |url=http://www.territorialbrass.com/LaGuardia.html |title=Achille La Guardia:  Bandmaster of the 11th U.S. Infantry Territorial Brass |author=Foraker, Sheila |accessdate=December 1, 2010}}</ref> He graduated from the [[Dwight School]], a private school on the Upper West Side of New York City.\n\nLa Guardia joined the [[State Department]] and served in U.S. consulates in [[Budapest]], Trieste ([[Austria-Hungary]], now [[Italy]]), and Fiume ([[Austria-Hungary]], now [[Rijeka]], [[Croatia]]), (1901\u20131906). He returned to the United States to continue his education at [[New York University]]. From 1907 to 1910, he worked as an [[interpreter]] for the [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement|U.S. Bureau of Immigration]] at the [[Ellis Island]] immigration station.\n\nHe graduated from [[New York University School of Law]] in 1910, was admitted to the bar the same year, and began a law practice in New York City.<ref name=\"CONGRESSBIO\"/>\n\n===Marriages and family===\nLa Guardia married twice. His first wife was Thea Almerigotti, an [[Istria]]n immigrant, whom he married on March 8, 1919. In June 1920 they had a daughter, Fioretta Thea, who died May 9, 1921, of [[spinal meningitis]]. His first wife died of [[tuberculosis]] on November 29, 1921, at the age of 26.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://istrianet.org/istria/illustri/non-istrian/la_guardia/family-album2.htm |title=La Guardia and Wagner Archives Photo Collection \u2013 Family Album # 2 |accessdate=December 1, 2010}}</ref> In 1929 he married Marie Fisher (1895\u20131984) who had been his secretary while in Congress; they adopted two children, Eric Henry (born 1930) and Jean Marie (1928\u20131962), the biological daughter of Thea's sister.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.laguardiafoundation.org|title=Fiorello H.

He resigned his seat in Congress on December 31, 1919. He served as senior advisor to President Herbert Hoover from 1930&ndash;33.\n\n===President of the Board of Aldermen===\n[[Image:LaGuardia In.JPG|upright|thumb|[[The New York Times]] front page November 5, 1919]]\n[[File:LaGuardia Congress.jpg|thumb|La Guardia during his time in [[70th United States Congress|Congress]], c. 1929.]]\n\nIn 1919, La Guardia was chosen to run as the Republican candidate for the office of President of the [[Alderman#In the United States|New York City Board of Aldermen]]. His Democratic opponent was [[Robert L. Moran (politician)|Robert L. Moran]], an alderman from the Bronx who had succeeded to the Board presidency in 1918 when [[Alfred E.

[[Tammany Hall]] looked with alarm upon Kelly's entrance into the campaign and tried to persuade him to withdraw his candidacy and throw his support behind Moran. When he refused, Tammany went to the [[New York Supreme Court]] and successfully sued to keep Kelly's name off the ballot.<ref name=\"Own Pistol 1930\">[https://www.nytimes.com/1930/07/23/archives/maj-kelly-killed-by-his-own-pistol-dynamite-mike-of-old-69th-is.html \"Major Kelly Killed by His Own Pistol\"] (fee).

He wanted a change for the immigrants, especially with the immigrant medical examinations that took place on Ellis Island. His passion for justice among immigrants, and his ability to speak Italian, Yiddish, and Croatian helped him in his endeavor for justice amongst immigrant factory workers and set him on his path in public service.<ref>{{cite web|title=An Insurgent's Origin: Immigration and Unions in New York|last=La Guardia|first=Fiorello|url=http://www.timelinetheatre.com/fiorello2/Fiorello2_LobbyDisplay.pdf|accessdate=March 27, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Return to Congress===\nLa Guardia, running as a Republican, won a seat in Congress from the Italian stronghold of [[East Harlem]] in 1922 and served in the House until March 3, 1933.<ref name=\"Zinn, 1959\"/> A leading liberal reformer, La Guardia sponsored labor legislation and railed against immigration quotas. His major legislation was the [[Norris\u2013La Guardia Act]], cosponsored with Nebraska senator [[George W. Norris|George Norris]] in 1932.  It circumvented Supreme Court limitations on the activities of labor unions, especially as those limitations were imposed between the enactment of the [[Clayton Antitrust Act]] in 1914 and the end of the 1920s. Based on the theory that the lower courts are creations not of the Constitution but of Congress, and that Congress therefore has wide power in defining and restricting their jurisdiction, the act forbids issuance of injunctions to sustain anti-union contracts of employment, to prevent ceasing or refusing to perform any work or remain in any relation of employment, or to restrain acts generally constituting component parts of strikes, boycotts, and picketing. It also said courts could no longer enforce [[yellow-dog contract]]s, which are labor contracts prohibiting a worker from joining a union.<ref>Zinn, ''La Guardia in Congress'' pp. 226\u201330</ref><ref>Bernstein, Irving (1966). ''The Lean Years: A History of the American Worker, 1920\u20131933''. pp. 406\u20139.</ref>\n\n====Foreign policy====\nNever an [[isolationism|isolationist]], he supported using American influence abroad on behalf of democracy or for national independence or against autocracy. Thus he supported the Irish independence movement and the anti-czarist [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917, but did not approve of [[Vladimir Lenin]].  Unlike most progressive colleagues, such as Norris, La Guardia consistently backed [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalism]], speaking in favor of the [[League of Nations]] and the [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]] as well as peace and disarmament conferences. In domestic policies he tended toward [[socialism]] and wanted to [[nationalization|nationalize]] and regulate; however he was never close to the [[Socialist Party of the USA|Socialist Party]] and never bothered to read [[Marx|Karl Marx]].<ref>Zinn, ''La Guardia in Congress'' pp. 267\u201370</ref>\n\n====Champion of the progressive movement====\nAs a congressman, La Guardia was a tireless and vocal champion of [[Progressive Era|progressive]] causes, from allowing more immigration and removing [[United States occupation of Nicaragua|U.S. troops from Nicaragua]] to speaking up for the rights and livelihoods of striking miners, impoverished farmers, oppressed minorities, and struggling families. He fought for [[Progressive tax|progressive income taxes]], greater government oversight of [[Wall Street]], and national employment insurance for workers idled by the Great Depression.<ref name=\"Zinn, 1959\"/>\n\n====Prohibition====\nLa Guardia was one of the first Republicans to voice his opinion about [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition]], urging that the Dry cause \"would prove disastrous in the long run\". This was breaking a taboo, given the fact that both parties \"avoided taking a stand on prohibition issues\" at the time.<ref>{{cite book|last1=LERNER|first1=Michael A.|title=Dry Manhattan: Prohibition in New York City|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674040090|page=234|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GyQqk-hxaO4C&pg=PA234234|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Teaching|first1=Mitchell Shelton, The Harvey Goldberg Center for Excellence in|title=Fiorella LaGuardia on Prohibition {{!}} Temperance & Prohibition|url=https://prohibition.osu.edu/american-prohibition-1920/fiorella-laguardia-prohibition|website=prohibition.osu.edu}}</ref>\n\n====Defeats in 1929 and 1932====\nAs a Republican, La Guardia had to support [[Warren G. Harding|Harding]] in 1920; he had to be silent in the 1928 campaign although he favored [[Al Smith]], a Democrat. <ref>McGoldrick, Joseph. \"The New York City Election of 1929\". ''The American Political Science Review,'' Vol. 24, No. 3 (Aug., 1930), pp. 688\u2013690 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1946937 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\n==Mayor of New York==\n\n===1933 election===\nWalker and his Irish-run Tammany Hall were forced out of office by scandal and La Guardia was determined to replace him. First he had to win the nomination of both the Republican party and also the \"Fusion\" group of independents. He was not the first choice of either, for they distrusted Italians. On the other hand, La Guardia had enormous determination, high visibility, the support of reformer [[Samuel Seabury (judge)|Samuel Seabury]] and the ability to ruin the prospects of any rival by a divisive primary contest. He secured the nominations and expected an easy win against hapless incumbent Mayor [[John P. O'Brien]]. However, at the last minute [[Joseph V. McKee]] entered the race as the nominee of the new \"Recovery party\". McKee was a formidable opponent because he was sponsored by Bronx Democratic boss [[Edward J. Flynn]] and apparently was opposed by President Franklin Roosevelt. La Guardia made corruption his main issue. The campaign saw mud slung three ways, with La Guardia denounced as a far-left \"Red\", O'Brien as a pawn of the bosses, and McKee as an anti-Semite. La Guardia's win was based on a complex coalition of regular Republicans (mostly middle class [[German Americans]] in the boroughs outside Manhattan), a minority of reform-minded Democrats, some Socialists, a large proportion of middle-class Jews, and the great majority of Italians. The Italians had been loyal to Tammany; their switch proved decisive.<ref>Arthur H. Mann, ''La Guardia Comes to Power 1933'' (1969)</ref>\n\n===Agenda===\n[[File:Franklin D. Roosevelt and Fiorello LaGuardia in Hyde Park - NARA - 196764.tif|thumb|La Guardia and [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]]]\nLa Guardia came to office in January 1934 with five main goals:<ref>Thomas Kessner, ''Fiorello H. LaGuardia and the Making of Modern New York'' (1989) ch 8\u20139</ref>\n* Restore the financial health and break free from the bankers' control\n* Expand the federally funded work-relief program for the unemployed\n* End corruption in government and racketeering in key sectors of the economy\n* Replace patronage with a merit-based civil service, with high prestige\n* Modernize the infrastructure, especially transportation and parks\n\nHe achieved most of the first four goals in his first hundred days, as FDR gave him 20% of the entire national [[Civil Works Administration|CWA]] budget for work relief.  La Guardia then collaborated closely with [[Robert Moses]], with support from the governor, Democrat [[Herbert H. Lehman|Herbert Lehman]], to upgrade the decaying infrastructure. The city was favored by the [[New Deal]] in terms of funding for public works projects.\n\n===Ethnic politics===\nLa Guardia governed in an uneasy alliance with New York's Jews and liberal [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|WASPs]], together with ethnic Italians and Germans.<ref>Ronald H. Bayor, ''Fiorello La Guardia: Ethnicity and Reform'' (1993)</ref>\n\nLa Guardia was not an orthodox Republican. He also ran as the nominee of the [[American Labor Party]], a union-dominated anti-[[Tammany Hall|Tammany]] left wing group that supported Franklin D. Roosevelt for president beginning in 1936. La Guardia supported Roosevelt, chairing the Committee of Independent Voters for Roosevelt and Wallace with Senator George Norris during the [[U.S. presidential election, 1940|1940 presidential election]].\n\nLa Guardia was the city's first Italian-American mayor, but was not a typical Italian New Yorker. He was a Republican [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopalian]] who had grown up in Arizona and had a Triestine Jewish mother<ref name=IlPiccolo>{{cite web|url=http://ilpiccolo.gelocal.it/dettaglio/le-radici-triestine-di-fiorello-laguardia-leggendario-sindaco-di-new-york-city/1313385|title=Le radici triestine di Fiorello LaGuardia leggendario sindaco di New York City|last=Gross|first=Daniela |work=Newspaper article|publisher=Il Piccolo|pages=1|language=Italian|accessdate=April 23, 2010}}</ref> and a lapsed Catholic father. He spoke several languages; when working at Ellis Island, he was certified as an interpreter for Italian, German, Yiddish, and Croatian.<ref>{{cite web |title=Interpreter |url=https://www.nps.gov/elis/learn/historyculture/people_interpreter.htm |website=National Park Service - Ellis Island |accessdate=12 August 2018}}</ref> It served him well during a contentious congressional campaign in 1922. When Henry Frank, a Jewish opponent, accused him of anti-Semitism, La Guardia rejected the suggestion that he publicly disclose that his mother was Jewish as \"self-serving\". Instead, La Guardia dictated an open letter in Yiddish that was also printed in Yiddish. In it, he challenged Frank to publicly and openly debate the issues of the campaign \"ENTIRELY IN THE YIDDISH LANGUAGE.\" Frank, although he was Jewish, could not speak the language and was forced to decline\u2014and lost the election.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\n===Crime===\nLa Guardia loathed the [[gangster]]s who brought a negative stereotype and shame to the [[Italian American|Italian community]].<ref>Thomas Kessner, ''Fiorello H. LaGuardia and the Making of Modern New York''  (1989) pp 350\u201368</ref> His first action as mayor was to order the chief of police to arrest mob boss [[Lucky Luciano]] on whatever charges could be found. La Guardia then went after the gangsters with a vengeance, stating in a radio address to the people of New York in his high-pitched, squeaky voice, \"Let's drive the bums out of town\". In 1934 he went on a search-and-destroy mission looking for mob boss [[Frank Costello]]'s slot machines, which La Guardia executed with gusto, rounding up thousands of the \"one armed bandits\", swinging a sledgehammer and dumping them off a barge into the water for the newspapers and media. In 1935 La Guardia appeared at [[The Bronx Terminal Market]] to institute a citywide ban on the sale, display, and possession of [[artichoke]]s, whose prices were inflated by mobs. When prices went down, the ban was lifted.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/08/realestate/streetscapes-bronx-terminal-market-trying-duplicate-little-flower-s-success.html |title=Streetscapes/Bronx Terminal Market; Trying to Duplicate the Little Flower's Success |work= [[The New York Times]] |author= [[Christopher Gray|Gray, Christopher]] |date= May 8, 1994 |accessdate= July 6, 2011}}</ref> In 1936, La Guardia had special prosecutor [[Thomas E. Dewey]], a future Republican presidential candidate, single out Lucky Luciano for prosecution. Dewey led a successful investigation into Luciano's lucrative prostitution operation, eventually sending Luciano to jail with a 30\u201350&nbsp;year sentence. The case was made into the 1937 movie ''[[Marked Woman]]'', starring [[Bette Davis]].\n\nLa Guardia proved successful in shutting down the [[burlesque]] theaters, whose shows offended his puritanical sensibilities.<ref>Friedman, Andrea (October 1996).

He is given credit for many massive public works programs administered by his powerful Parks Commissioner [[Robert Moses]], which employed thousands of voters. The mayor's relentless lobbying for federal funds allowed New York to develop its economic infrastructure.<ref name=\"Martin Shefter 1992 30\">{{cite book|author=Martin Shefter|title=Political Crisis/fiscal Crisis: The Collapse and Revival of New York City|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I-4tdn4sINgC&pg=PA30|year=1992|publisher=Columbia UP|page=30}}</ref>\n\nTo obtain large-scale federal money the mayor became a close partner of Roosevelt and New Deal agencies such as the [[Civil Works Administration|CWA]], [[Public Works Administration|PWA]], and [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]], which poured $1.1&nbsp;billion into the city from 1934\u201339. In turn he gave FDR a showcase for [[New Deal]] achievement, helped defeat FDR's political enemies in Tammany Hall (the Democratic party machine in Manhattan). He and Moses built highways, bridges and tunnels, transforming the physical landscape of New York City. The [[West Side Highway]], [[East River Drive]], [[Brooklyn Battery Tunnel]], [[Triborough Bridge]], and two airports ([[LaGuardia Airport]], and, later, [[JFK Airport|Idlewild, now JFK Airport]]) were built during his mayoralty.<ref>Williams,  Mason B.

In a public address in 1934, La Guardia warned that \"part of Hitler's program is the complete annihilation of the Jews in Germany\". In 1937, speaking before the Women's Division of the [[American Jewish Congress]], he called for the creation of a special pavilion at the upcoming [[1939 New York World's Fair|New York World's Fair]], \"a chamber of horrors\" for \"that brown-shirted fanatic\".<ref>David M.

Gemma and her family did not speak [[German language|German]], and had no identity papers, money, or means of documenting where they had been. Gemma finally managed to get word to the Americans who contacted La Guardia, who had no idea where they were. He worked to get them on the immigration lists, but asserted in a letter, included in the appendix of Gemma's memoir, that her \"case was the same as that of hundreds of thousands of displaced people\" and \"no exceptions can be made\". Thus, despite Gemma's intimate connection with a powerful American politician, who was then director of the [[United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration|United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA)]], it took two years for her to be cleared and sent to the United States. She returned to New York in May 1947, where she was reunited with her brother only four months before he died.

The government knew that such air raids were impossible, but the goal was to psychologically mobilize many thousands of middle class volunteers to make them feel part of the war effort. At the urging of aviation advocate [[Gill Robb Wilson]], LaGuardia, in his capacity as Director of the OCD, created the [[Civil Air Patrol]] with [[s:Administrative Order 9|Administrative Order 9]], signed by him on 1 December 1941 and published 8 December 1941.<ref name=\"CAPP50-5\">{{cite book |url=http://www.capmembers.com/media/cms/u_082503081737.pdf |title=Introduction to Civil Air Patrol |publisher=National Headquarters Civil Air Patrol |location=[[Maxwell Air Force Base|Maxwell AFB]] |date=1 August 2002 |id=CAP Pamphlet 50-5}}</ref> La Guardia remained Mayor of New York, shuttling back and forth with three days in Washington and four in the city in an effort to do justice to two herculean jobs.

[[Jaan K\u00fcnnap]] with the [[flag of Estonia]] at the top of [[Lenin Peak]] ({{convert|7134|m|abbr=in|disp=sqbr}}) in 1989.]]\nA '''flag''' is a piece of fabric (most often rectangular or [[quadrilateral]]) with a distinctive design and colors. It is used as a [[symbol]], a signaling device, or for decoration. The term ''flag'' is also used to refer to the [[graphic design]] employed, and flags have evolved into a general tool for rudimentary signalling and identification, especially in environments where communication is challenging (such as the [[Maritime flag|maritime environment]], where [[Flag semaphore|semaphore]] is used). The study of flags is known as \"[[vexillology]]\" from the [[Latin]] ''vexillum'', meaning \"flag\" or \"[[banner]]\".\n\n[[National flag]]s are [[patriotic]] symbols with widely varied interpretations that often include strong [[military]] associations because of their original and ongoing use for that purpose. Flags are also used in [[messaging]], [[advertising]], or for [[decorative]] purposes.\n\nSome military units are called \"flags\" after their use of flags. A ''flag'' (Arabic: \u0644\u0648\u0627\u0621) is equivalent to a [[brigade]] in Arab countries. In Spain, a ''flag'' (Spanish: ''bandera'') is a [[battalion]]-equivalent in the [[Spanish Legion]].\n\n\n==History==\n{{further|Vexilloid|Heraldic flag|Royal Standard}}\n{{one source|section|date=May 2014}}\n[[File:Bronze flag, Shadad Kerman, Iran.JPG|upright=0.7|thumb|right|Bronze flag found in [[Shahdad]], [[Iran]], 3rd millennium BC]]\nIn antiquity, [[field sign]]s or standards were used in warfare that can be categorized as [[vexilloid]] or 'flag-like'. Examples include the [[Sassanid]] battle standard [[Derafsh Kaviani]], and the standards of the [[Roman legion]]s such as the [[aquila (Roman)|eagle]] of [[Augustus Caesar]]'s [[Legio X Fretensis|Xth legion]], or the [[Draconarius|dragon standard]] of the [[Sarmatians]]; the latter was let fly freely in the wind, carried by a horseman, but judging from depictions it was more similar to an elongated [[dragon kite]] than to a simple flag.\n\nDuring the [[High Middle Ages]], flags came to be used primarily as a [[heraldic flag|heraldic device]] in battle, allowing more easily to identify a knight than only from the heraldic device painted on the shield. Already during the high medieval period, and increasingly during the [[Late Middle Ages]], [[city state]]s and [[medieval commune|communes]] such as those of the [[Old Swiss Confederacy]] also began to use flags as field signs. Regimental flags for individual units became commonplace during the [[Early Modern period]].\n\n[[File:Sujagi (1871).jpg|upright=0.7|left|thumb|''[[Sujagi]]'' of [[Eo Jae-yeon]], captured in 1871]]\n\nDuring the peak of the [[age of sail]], beginning in the early 17th century, it was customary (and later a legal requirement) for ships to carry flags designating their nationality;<ref>Articles 90\u201394 of the [[UN Convention on the Law of the Sea]]</ref> these flags eventually evolved into the national flags and [[maritime flags]] of today. Flags also became the preferred means of [[communication]]s at sea, resulting in various systems of flag signals; ''see, [[International maritime signal flags]]''.\n\nUse of flags outside of military or naval context begins only with the rise of [[nationalism|nationalist]] sentiment by the end of the 18th century; the earliest [[national flag]]s date to that period, and during the 19th century it became common for every sovereign state to introduce a national flag.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} \n{{Clear}}\n\n[[File:Flags at half-staff outside Central Plaza.jpg|thumb|Flags at [[half-mast]] outside [[Central Plaza, Hong Kong]], after the [[2008 Sichuan earthquake]].

Some [[national flag]]s have been particularly inspirational to other nations, countries, or subnational entities in the design of their own flags. Some prominent examples include:\n[[File:Dannebrog isams\u00f8.jpg|thumb|left|The Danish national flag (Dannebrog) waving in [[Sams\u00f8]].]]\n* The [[flag of Denmark]], the ''Dannebrog'', is attested in 1478, and is the oldest national flag still in use. It inspired the [[Nordic Cross Flag|cross design]] of the other [[Nordic countries]]: [[Flag of Norway|Norway]], [[Flag of Sweden|Sweden]], [[Flag of Finland|Finland]], [[Flag of Iceland|Iceland]], and regional Scandinavian flags for the [[Flag of the Faroe Islands|Faroe Islands]], [[Flag of \u00c5land|\u00c5land]], [[Flag of Sk\u00e5neland|Scania]] and [[Flag of Bornholm|Bornholm]], as well as flags for the non-Scandinavian [[Flag of Shetland|Shetland]] and [[Flag of Orkney|Orkney]].<ref>[http://denmark.dk/en/quick-facts/national-flag/ National Flag -The official website of Denmark]. An earlier use of the white cross on red is attested by an armorial (Netherlands) of 1370-1386. In later monastic tradition, the Danneborg made its first, miraculous appearance at the Battle of Lindanise on 15 June 1219.</ref>\n* The [[flag of the Netherlands]] is the oldest [[tricolour (flag)|tricolour]]. Its three colours of red, white and blue go back to [[Charlemagne]]'s time, the 9th century. The coastal region of what today is the Netherlands was then known for its cloth in these colours. Maps from the early 16th century already put flags in these colours next to this region, like Texeira's map of 1520. A century before that, during the 15th century, the three colours were mentioned as the coastal signals for this area, with the three bands straight or diagonal, single or doubled. As [[state flag]] it first appeared around 1572 as the [[Prince's Flag]] in orange\u2013white\u2013blue. Soon the more famous red\u2013white\u2013blue began appearing, becoming the prevalent version from around 1630. Orange made a comeback during the civil war of the late 18th century, signifying the orangist or pro-[[stadtholder]] party. During World War II the pro-Nazi [[National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands|NSB]] used it. Any symbolism has been added later to the three colours, although the orange comes from the [[House of Orange-Nassau]]. This use of orange comes from Nassau, which today uses orange-blue, not from Orange, which today uses red-blue. However, the usual way to show the link with the House of Orange-Nassau is the orange pennant above the red-white-blue.\nIt is said that the Dutch Tricolour has inspired{{Citation needed |date=October 2007}} many flags but most notably those of [[Russia]], [[New York City]], and [[South Africa]] (the 1928\u201394 flag as well the current flag).  As the probable inspiration for the Russian flag, it is the source too for the [[Pan-Slavic colours]] red, white and blue, adopted by many [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] states and peoples as their symbols; examples are [[Flag of Slovakia|Slovakia]], [[Flag of Serbia|Serbia]], and [[Flag of Slovenia|Slovenia]].\n* The national [[flag of France]] was designed in 1794. As a forerunner of revolution, France's tricolour flag style has been adopted by other nations. Examples: [[Flag of Italy|Italy]], [[flag of Costa Rica|Costa Rica]], [[flag of Dominican Republic|Dominican Republic]], [[Flag of Ireland|Ireland]], [[flag of Haiti|Haiti]] {{Citation needed|reason=The flag of Haiti is a bicolour flag blazed with its coat of arms, seemingly unrelated to the French Tricolore.|date=October 2016}}, [[Flag of Romania|Romania]] and [[Flag of Mexico|Mexico]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n* The [[Union Flag]] (Union Jack) of the [[United Kingdom]] is the most commonly used. British colonies typically flew a flag based on one of the ensigns based on this flag, and many former colonies have retained the design to acknowledge their cultural history. Examples: [[Flag of Australia|Australia]], [[Flag of Fiji|Fiji]], [[Flag of New Zealand|New Zealand]], [[Flag of Tuvalu|Tuvalu]], and also the Canadian provinces of [[Flag of Manitoba|Manitoba]], [[Flag of Ontario|Ontario]] and [[Flag of British Columbia|British Columbia]], and the American state of [[Flag of Hawaii|Hawaii]]; ''see [[commons:Flags based on British ensigns]]''.\n* The [[flag of the United States]] is nicknamed ''The Stars and Stripes'' or ''Old Glory''. Some nations imitated this flag so as to symbolize their similarity to the United States and/or the [[American Revolution]]. Examples: [[Flag of Liberia|Liberia]], [[Flag of Chile|Chile]], [[Flag of Uruguay|Uruguay]]{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}, [[Flag of the Republic of China|Taiwan (ROC)]], [[Flag of Malaysia|Malaysia]] and the [[France|French]] region of [[Flag of Brittany|Brittany]].\n[[File:Flag of Ethiopia (1975\u20131987).svg|thumb|The [[Flag of Ethiopia]]'s colours inspired the colours of many African national flags.]]\n* [[Ethiopia]] was seen as a model by emerging [[Africa]]n states of the 1950s and 1960s, as it was one of the oldest independent states in Africa. Accordingly, its [[Flag of Ethiopia|flag]] became the source of the [[Pan-African colours]], or 'Rasta colours'. Examples: [[Flag of Benin|Benin]], [[Flag of Togo|Togo]], [[Flag of Senegal|Senegal]], [[Flag of Ghana|Ghana]], [[Flag of Mali|Mali]], [[Flag of Guinea|Guinea]].\n* The [[flag of Turkey]], which is very similar to the last flag of the old [[Ottoman Empire]], has been an inspiration for the flag designs of many other Muslim nations. During the time of the Ottomans the [[crescent]] began to be associated with [[Islam]] and this is reflected on the flags of [[Flag of Algeria|Algeria]], [[Flag of Azerbaijan|Azerbaijan]], [[Flag of Comoros|Comoros]], [[Flag of Libya|Libya]], [[Flag of Mauritania|Mauritania]], [[Flag of Pakistan|Pakistan]], [[Flag of Tunisia|Tunisia]] and [[Flag of Maldives|Maldives]]\n[[File:Flag of Abkhazia (GE).svg|thumb|The [[flag of Abkhazia]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] on 1967.]]\n[[File:Flag of Hejaz 1917.svg|thumb|The [[flag of the Arab Revolt]] of 1916 inspired the flags of many Arab states.]]\n* The [[Pan-Arab colours]], green, white, red and black, are derived from the flag of the [[Arab Revolt|Great Arab Revolt]] as seen on the flags of [[Flag of Jordan|Jordan]], [[Flag of Libya|Libya]], [[Flag of Kuwait|Kuwait]], [[Flag of Sudan|Sudan]], [[Flag of Syria|Syria]], the [[Flag of United Arab Emirates|United Arab Emirates]], [[Flag of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic|Western Sahara]], [[Flag of Egypt|Egypt]], [[Flag of Iraq|Iraq]], [[Flag of Yemen|Yemen]] and [[Palestinian flag|Palestine]].\n* The [[Flag of the Soviet Union|Soviet flag]], with its golden symbols of the [[hammer and sickle]] on a red field, was an inspiration to flags of other [[communism|communist]] states, such as [[Flag of East Germany|East Germany]], [[Flag of the People's Republic of China|People's Republic of China]], [[Flag of Vietnam|Vietnam]], [[Flag of Angola|Angola]], [[Flag of Afghanistan|Afghanistan (1978\u20131980)]] and [[Flag of Mozambique|Mozambique]].\n* The [[flag of Venezuela]], created by [[Francisco de Miranda]] to represent the independence movement in Venezuela that later gave birth to the [[Republic of Gran Colombia|\"Gran Colombia\"]], inspired the flags of [[Flag of Colombia|Colombia]], [[Flag of Ecuador|Ecuador]], and [[Flag of the Federal Territory (Malaysia)|the Federal Territories in Malaysia]], all sharing three bands of yellow, blue and red with the flag of Venezuela.\n* The [[flag of Argentina]], created by [[Manuel Belgrano]] during the war of independence, was the inspiration for the [[United Provinces of Central America]]'s flag, which in turn was the origin for the flags of [[Flag of Guatemala|Guatemala]], [[Flag of Honduras|Honduras]], [[Flag of El Salvador|El Salvador]], and [[Flag of Nicaragua|Nicaragua]].\n\nNational flag designs are often used to signify nationality in other forms, such as [[flag patch]]es.\n\n===Civil flags===\n{{Main|Civil flag}}\nA ''civil'' flag is a version of the national flag that is flown by civilians on non-government installations or craft. The use of civil flags was more common in the past, in order to denote buildings or ships that were not manned by the military. In some countries the civil flag is the same as the [[war flag]] or [[state flag]], but without the coat of arms, such as in the case of [[Flag of Spain|Spain]], and in others it's an alteration of the war flag.\n\n===War flags===\n{{Main|War flag|Colours, standards and guidons}}\n[[File:Ensign of the Royal Air Force.svg|thumb|Standing for the [[UK]]'s [[Royal Air Force]], the [[Royal Air Force Ensign|Ensign of the RAF]] displays the RAF [[roundel]] that is also  displayed on the fusalage and wings of British warplanes.]]\n\nSeveral countries, including the [[British Army]] and the  [[Royal Navy]] ([[White Ensign]]) of the [[United Kingdom]] ([[Great Britain]]) and the [[Soviet Union]] have had [[Union Jack|unique flags]] flown by their [[armed forces]] separately, rather than the [[national flag]].\n\nOther countries' armed forces (such as those of the [[United States]] or [[Switzerland]]) use their standard [[Flag of the United States|national flag]], in addition, the  U.S. has alongside flags and seals designed from long tradition for each of its six uniformed military services/military sub-departments in the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]] and the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|U.S. Department of Homeland Security]]. The [[Philippines]]' armed forces may use their [[Flag of the Philippines|standard national flag]], but during times of war the flag is turned upside down. [[Flag of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]]'s flag is also turned upside down during times of war. These are also considered war flags, though the terminology only applies to the flag's military usage.\n\nLarge versions of the war flag flown on the [[warship]]s of countries' [[navy|navies]] are known as [[battle ensign]]s. In addition besides flying the national standard or a military services' emblem flag at a military fort, base, station or post and at sea at the stern (rear) or main top mast of a warship, a [[Jack (flag)|Naval Jack flag]] and other [[Maritime flag]]s, [[Pennant (commissioning)|pennants]] and emblems are flown at the bow (front). In times of war waving a white flag is a banner of truce, talks/negotiations or surrender.\n\nFour distinctive [[Africa]]n flags currently in the collection of the [[National Maritime Museum]] in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] were flown in action by [[Itsekiri]] ships under the control of [[Nana Olomu]] during conflict in the late [[19th century]]. One is the flag generally known as the [[Flag of the Benin Empire|Benin Empire flag]] and one is referred to as Nana Olomu's flag.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rog.nmm.ac.uk/upload/amaxus_pdf/amaxus_conWebDoc_229.pdf|title=Welcome to the Royal Museums Greenwich Blogs - Royal Museums Greenwich Blogs|publisher=}}</ref>\n[[File:Flag of the United Nations.svg|thumb|The [[Flag of the United Nations]], sky blue field with north polar view looking down on a world map in white with two olive branches wreaths curved around.

A national flag flown at sea is known as an [[ensign]]. A courteous, peaceable [[merchant navy|merchant ship]] or [[yacht]] customarily flies its ensign (in the usual ensign position), together with the flag of whatever nation it is currently visiting at the mast (known as a [[courtesy flag]]). To fly one's ensign alone in foreign waters, a foreign port or in the face of a foreign warship traditionally indicates a willingness to fight, with [[cannon]], for the right to do so. As of 2009, this custom is still taken seriously by many naval and port authorities and is readily enforced in many parts of the world by boarding, confiscation and other civil penalties.\n\nIn some countries [[yacht ensign]]s are different from merchant ensigns in order to signal that the yacht is not carrying [[cargo]] that requires a [[customs]] declaration. Carrying commercial cargo on a boat with a yacht ensign is deemed to be [[smuggling]] in many jurisdictions. There is a system of [[international maritime signal flags]] for numerals and letters of the alphabet. Each flag or pennant has a specific meaning when flown individually. As well, [[Flag semaphore|semaphore flags]] can be used to communicate on an ''ad hoc'' basis from ship to ship over short distances.\nTraditionally, a vessel flying under the courtesy flag of a specific nation, regardless of the vessel's country of registry, is considered to be operating under the law of her 'host' nation.\n\nAnother category of maritime flag flown by some [[United States Government]] ships is the [[distinguishing mark]]. Although the [[United States Coast Guard]] has its own service ensign, all other U.S. Government ships fly the national ensign their service ensign, following [[United States Navy]] practice. To distinguish themselves from ships of the Navy, such ships historically have flown their parent organisation's flag from a forward mast as a distinguishing mark. Today, for example, commissioned ships of the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) fly the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration#Flag|NOAA flag]] as a distinguishing mark.\n\n==Shapes and designs==\n[[File:Flag of Ohio.svg|thumb|left|The Ohio burgee]]\n[[File:Flag of Nepal.svg|thumb|The [[flag of Nepal]], a national flag that is not rectangular]]\n[[File:Flag of Kiribati.svg|thumb|The [[flag of Kiribati]], a [[banner of arms]]]]\nFlags are usually rectangular in shape (often in the ratio 2:3, 1:2, or 3:5), but may be of any shape or size that is practical for flying, including square, triangular, or swallow tailed. A more unusual flag shape is that of the [[flag of Nepal]], which is in the shape of two stacked triangles. Other unusual flag shapes include the [[flag of Ohio]] and the [[flag of Tampa, Florida|flag of Tampa]].\n\nMany flags are dyed [[through and through]] to be inexpensive to manufacture, such that the reverse side is the [[mirror image]] of the [[obverse]] (front) side, generally the side displayed when, from the observer's point of view, the flag flies from pole-side left to right. This presents two possibilities:\n#If the design is [[symmetric]]al in an axis parallel to the flag pole, obverse and reverse will be identical despite the mirror-reversal, such as the [[flag of India|Indian Flag]] or [[Flag of Canada|Canadian Flag]]\n#If not, the obverse and reverse will present two variants of the same design, one with the [[Flag terminology#Description of standard flag parts and terms|hoist]] on the left (usually considered the obverse side), the other with the hoist on the right (usually considered the reverse side of the flag). This is very common and usually not disturbing if there is no text in the design.\n\nSome complex flag designs are not intended to be shown on both sides, requiring separate obverse and reverse sides if made correctly. In these cases there is a design element (usually text) which is not symmetric and should be read in the same direction, regardless of whether the hoist is to the viewer's left or right. These cases can be divided into two types:\n#The same (asymmetric) design may be duplicated on both sides. Such flags can be manufactured by creating two identical through and through flags and then sewing them back to back, though this can affect the resulting combination's responsiveness to the wind. Depictions of such flags may be marked with the symbol [[File:IFIS Equal.svg]], indicating the reverse is congruent to (rather than a mirror image of) the obverse.\n#Rarely, the reverse design may differ, in whole or in part, from that of the obverse. Examples of [[flags whose reverse differs from the obverse]] include the [[flag of Paraguay]], the [[flag of Oregon]], and the historical [[flag of the Soviet Union]]. Depictions of such flags may be marked with the symbol [[File:IFIS Two-sided.svg]].\n\n<!--removed pending Guinness verification of the May 2010 Moroccan flag\n{{flag image|Image = Israelisuperflag.jpg|Caption = The largest flag in the world, a [[flag of Israel]]}}\n/-->\nCommon designs on flags include crosses, stripes, and divisions of the surface, or ''field'', into bands or quarters\u2014patterns and principles mainly derived from [[heraldry]]. A heraldic coat of arms may also be flown as a [[Banner#Heraldic banners|banner of arms]], as is done on both the state [[flag of Maryland]] and the [[flag of Kiribati]].\n\nThe ''de jure'' [[flag of Libya]] under [[Muammar Gaddafi]], which consisted of a rectangular field of green, was for a long period the only national flag using a single colour and no design or insignia. However, other historical states have also used flags without designs or insignia, such as the [[Soviet Republic of Hungary]], whose flag was a plain field of red.\n\nColours are normally described with common names, such as \"red\", but may be further specified using [[colorimetry]].\n\nThe largest flag flown from a flagpole worldwide, according to Guinness World Records, is the [[flag of Mexico]] flown in [[Piedras Negras, Coahuila|Piedras Negras]], [[Mexico]].

Flags are also adopted by religious groups and flags such as the [[Jain flag]], [[Sikh flag]], [[sindhi flag]] and the [[Christian flag]] are used to represent a whole religion.\n\n==Linguistic flags==\n[[File:Flag of La Francophonie.svg|thumb|Flag of La [[Francophonie]]]]\n[[File:Flag of the Hispanicity.svg|thumb|Flag of [[Hispanidad|Hispanicity]]]]\n<!-- Commented out: [[File:Flag of the CPLP.svg|thumb|Flag  of [[CPLP]] (Lusophone Community)]] -->\n[[File:Flag of Esperanto.svg|thumb|Flag of [[Esperanto]]]]\nAs languages rarely have a flag designed to represent them,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/flags.html|title=Why you should not use a flag as a symbol of language|publisher=}}</ref> it is a common but unofficial practice to use national flags to identify them.

Examples of such use include:\n* representing language skills of an individual, like a staff member of a company\n* displaying available languages on a multilingual website or software.\nThough this can be done in an uncontroversial manner in some cases, this can easily lead to some problems for certain languages:\n* languages generating [[language secessionism]], such as [[Serbo-Croatian]] which since the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]] in 1991, has lost its unitary codification and its official unitary status and is now divided into four official languages: [[Croatian language]], [[Bosnian language]], [[Serbian language]] and the [[Montenegrin language]]\n* languages spoken in [[World language|more than one country]], such as English or Arabic.\nIn this second case, common solutions include symbolising these languages by:\n* the flag of the country where the language originated\n* the flag of the country having the largest number of native speakers\n* a mixed flag of the both (when this is not the same)\n* the flag of the country most identified with that language in a specific region (e.g. Portuguese Language: Flag of Portugal in Europe and Flag of Brazil in South America). A Portugal-Brazil mixed flag, usually divided diagonally, is also a possibility.\n\nThus, on the Internet, it is common to see the English language associated with the [[flag of the United Kingdom]], or sometimes the [[flag of England]], the [[flag of the United States]] or a U.S.-UK mixed flag, usually divided diagonally.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Related flags==\nSince many flags have a simple design, there is bound to be cases of flags with similar designs. From 1948 to 1989, the [[flag of Romania]] had an insignia in the middle of the tricolour flag. In 1989 the insignia was removed, reverting Romania's flag back to an earlier version. This version matched the design which had been [[flag of Chad|adopted by Chad]] in 1959. This has concerned the Chadian government, and in 2004 they requested that the [[United Nations]] should consider it an issue. In response, the [[President of Romania|Romanian President]] [[Ion Iliescu]] stated to the media, \"The tricolour belongs to us.

They use the flags to indicate to the [[Referee (Football)|referee]] potential infringements of the laws, or who is entitled to possession of the ball that has gone out of the field of play, or, most famously, raising the flag to indicate an [[Offside (association football)|offside]] offence. Officials called ''touch judges'' use flags for similar purposes in both codes of [[Rugby football|rugby]].\n* In [[American Football|American]] and [[Canadian football]], [[referee]]s use [[penalty flag]]s to indicate that a foul has been committed in game play. The phrase used for such an indication is ''flag on the play''. The flag itself is a small, weighted handkerchief, tossed on the field at the approximate point of the infraction; the intent is usually to sort out the details after the current play from scrimmage has concluded. In American football, the flag is usually yellow; in Canadian football, it is usually orange.  In the [[National Football League]], coaches also use red challenge flags to indicate that they wish to contest a ruling on the field.\n* In [[yacht racing]], flags are used to communicate information from the race committee boat to the racers. Different flags hoisted from the committee boat may communicate a false start, changes in the course, a cancelled race, or other important information. Racing boats themselves may also use flags to symbolize a protest or distress. The flags are often part of the nautical alphabetic system of [[International maritime signal flags]], in which 26 different flags designate the 26 letters of the Latin alphabet.\n[[File:Auto Racing Chequered.svg|thumb|Flags flown at a [[auto racing|car race]]]]\n* In [[auto racing|auto]] and [[Motorcycle sport|motorcycle racing]], [[racing flags]] are used to communicate with drivers. Most famously, a checkered flag of black and white squares indicates the end of the race, and victory for the leader. A yellow flag is used to indicate caution requiring slow speed and a red flag requires racers to stop immediately. A black flag is used to indicate penalties.\n\n:{{Main|Racing flags}}\n* In addition, fans of almost all sports wave flags in the stands to indicate their support for the participants. Many sports teams have their own flags, and, in individual sports, fans will indicate their support for a player by waving the flag of his or her home country.\n* [[Capture the flag]] is a popular children's sport.\n* In [[Gaelic football]] and [[Hurling]] a green flag is used to indicate a goal while a white flag is used to indicate a point\n* In [[Australian rules football]], the [[Umpire (Australian rules football)|goal umpire]] will wave two flags to indicate a goal (worth six points) and a single flag to indicate a behind (worth one point).\n* For safety, [[Glossary of underwater diving terminology|dive flags]] indicate the locations of underwater [[SCUBA diving|scuba divers]] or that diving operations are being conducted in the vicinity.\n* In water sports such as Wakeboarding and Water-Skiing, an orange flag is held in between runs to indicate someone is in the water.\n* In [[golf]], the hole is almost always marked with a flag. The flagpole is designed to fit centered within the base of the hole and is removable.  Many courses will use colour-coded flags to determine a hole location at the front, middle or rear of the green.  However colour-coded flags are not used in the professional tours. (A rare example of a golf course that does not use flags to mark the hole is the East Course of [[Merion Golf Club]], which instead uses flagpoles topped by [[Merion Golf Club#Wicker baskets|wicker baskets]].)\n* Flag poles with flags of all shapes and sizes are used by marching bands, drum corps, and winter guard teams use flags as a method of visual enhancement in performances.\n\n==Diplomatic flags==\n{{main|Diplomatic flag}}\nSome countries use diplomatic flags, such as the [[United Kingdom]] <!--([[List of British flags#Diplomatic flags]])-->(see [[:File:British Ambassador Ensign.svg|Image of the Embassy flag]]) and the Kingdom of [[Thailand]] <!--([[List of Thai flags#Diplomatic flags]])-->(see [[:File:Embassador Flag of Thailand.svg|Image of the Embassy flag]]).\n\nThe [[Socialism|socialist]] movement uses [[Red flag (politics)|red flag]]s to represent their cause. The [[Anarchism|anarchist]] movement has a variety of different flags, but the primary flag associated with them is the [[Anarchist symbolism#Black flag|black flag]]. In the [[Spanish civil war]], the anarchists used the red-and-black bisected flag. In the 20th century, the [[Rainbow flag (gay movement)|rainbow flag]] was adopted as a symbol of the [[LGBT social movements]]. Its derivatives include the [[Bisexual pride flag|Bisexual pride]] and [[transgender pride flag]]s.\n\nSome of these political flags have become national flags, such as the red flag of the [[Soviet Union]] and national socialist banners for [[Nazi Germany]]. The present [[Flag of Portugal]] is based on what had been the political flag of the [[Portuguese Republican Party]] previous to the [[5 October 1910 revolution]] which brought this party to power.\n\n==Disability flags==\nSome disability advocacy groups have adopted flags to raise awareness of their causes.\n\nThe Epilepsy Awareness Flag includes a prominent [[lowercase]] letter 'e' on a white background.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://epilepsystore.com/product/epilepsy-awareness-flag/|title=Epilepsy Awareness Flag - EpilepsyStore.com|author=|date=|work=EpilepsyStore.com|access-date=31 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nWhen the World Federation of the Deaf adopted its own flag,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wfdeaf.org/news/article-5-aims/|title=Article 5 - Flag - WFD|author=|date=28 April 2011|work=WFDeaf.org|access-date=31 March 2017}}</ref> this action caused some controversy within the [[deaf]] community due to the popularity of another flag which was already being flown by many deaf people and related organisations.\n\n==Vehicle flags==\nFlags are often representative of an individual's affinity or allegiance to a country, team or business and can be presented in various ways. A popular trend that has surfaced revolves around the idea of the 'mobile' flag in which an individual displays their particular flag of choice on their vehicle. These items are commonly referred to as car flags and are usually manufactured from high strength polyester material and are attached to a vehicle via a polypropylene pole and clip window attachment.\n\n==Swimming flags==\n<div style=\"float:right;clear:right;\">\n[[File:Flags - swim between the.png|thumb|Open swimming area]]\n[[File:Flags crossed - do not swim.png|thumb|Closed swimming area]]\n</div>\nIn [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]], the [[Philippines]], and the [[United Kingdom]], a pair of red-yellow flags is used to mark the limits of the bathing area on a beach, usually guarded by [[surf lifesaving|surf lifesavers]]. If the beach is closed, the poles of the flags are crossed. The flags are coloured with a red triangle and a yellow triangle making a rectangular flag, or a red rectangle over a yellow rectangle. On many Australian beaches there is a slight variation with beach condition signaling. A red flag signifies a closed beach (in the UK also other dangers), yellow signifies strong current or difficult swimming conditions, and green represents a beach safe for general swimming. In [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], a red and yellow flag indicates that it is safe to swim; a red flag that it is unsafe; and no flag indicates that there are no lifeguards on duty. Blue flags may also be used away from the yellow-red lifesaver area to designate a zone for surfboarding and other small, non-motorised watercraft.\n\nReasons for closing the beach include:\n* [[dangerous rip]]\n* [[hurricane]] warning\n* no [[lifeguard]]s in attendance\n* [[pollution|overpolluted]] water\n* [[shark]]s\n* [[tsunami]]\n* [[wave]]s too strong\n\nA surf flag exists, divided into four quadrants. The top left and bottom right quadrants are black, and the remaining area is white.\n\n[[International maritime signal flags|Signal flag]] \"India\" (a black circle on a yellow square) is frequently used to denote a \"blackball\" zone where surfboards cannot be used but other water activities are permitted.\n\n==Railway flags==\nRailways use a number of coloured flags. When used as wayside signals they usually use the following meanings (exact meanings are set by the individual railroad company):\n* red = stop\n* yellow = proceed with care\n* green or white = proceed.\n* a flag of any colour waved vigorously means stop\n* a blue flag on the side of a locomotive means that it should not be moved because someone is working on it (or on the train attached to it). A blue flag on a track means that nothing on that track should be moved. The flag can only be removed by the person or group that placed it. In the railway dominated steel industry this principle of \"blue flag and tag\" was extended to all operations at Bethlehem Steel, Lackawanna, NY. If a man went inside a large machine or worked on an electrical circuit for example, his blue flag and tag was sacrosanct.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oshrc.gov/decisions/html_1990/79-2597.html|title=Docket No. 79-2597|publisher=}}</ref>  The \"[[Lockout-tagout|Lock Out/Tag Out]]\" practice is similar and now used in other industries to comply with safety regulations.\n\nAt night, the flags are replaced with lanterns showing the same colours.\n\nFlags displayed on the front of a moving locomotive are an acceptable replacement for classification lights and usually have the following meanings (exact meanings are set by the individual railroad company):\n* white = extra (not on the timetable)\n* green = another section following\n* red = last section\n\nAdditionally, a railroad brakeman will typically carry a red flag to make his or her hand signals more visible to the engineer. [[Railway signal]]s are a development of railway flags.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mysite.du.edu/~etuttle/rail/sigs.htm |title=Early Railway Signals |access-date=7 October 2007 |last=Calvert |first=J.B. |date=25 July 2004 |publisher=University of Denver }}</ref>\n\n==Flagpoles==\n{{Redirect|Flagpole|the magazine|Flagpole Magazine}}\nA flagpole, flagmast, flagstaff, or staff can be a simple support made of wood or metal. If it is taller than can be easily reached to raise the flag, a cord is used, looping around a pulley at the top of the pole with the ends tied at the bottom. The flag is fixed to one lower end of the cord, and is then raised by pulling on the other end. The cord is then tightened and tied to the pole at the bottom. The pole is usually topped by a flat plate or ball called a \"[[Truck (rigging)|truck]]\" (originally meant to keep a wooden pole from splitting) or a [[finial]] in a more complex shape. Very high flagpoles may require more complex support structures than a simple pole, such as a [[guyed mast]].\n\n[[Dwajasthambam]] are flagpoles commonly found at the entrances of [[South India]]n [[Hindu temple]]s.<ref>[[Alf Hiltebeitel|Hiltebeitel, Alf]] (1991).

The signalling is performed by an individual using two flags (or lighted wands), the positions of the flags indicating a symbol. The person who holds the flags is known as the signalman. This form of communication is primarily used by [[navy|naval]] signallers. This technique of signalling was adopted in the early 19th century and is still used in various forms today.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anbg.gov.au/flags/semaphore.html|title=Semaphore Flag Signalling System|author=|date=|work=ANBG.gov.au|access-date=31 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe colours of the flags can also be used to communicate. For example; a white flag means, among other things, surrender or peace, a red flag can be used as a warning signal, and a black flag can mean war, or determination to defeat enemies.\n\nOrientation of a flag is also used for communication, though the practice is rarely used given modern communication systems. Raising a flag upside-down was indicative that the raising force controlled that particular area, but that it was in severe distress.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.military.com/flag-day/flag-ettiquette-dos-and-donts.html|title=Flag Etiquette Do's and Don'ts|last=Scanlon|first=Caitlin|work=Military.com|access-date=2017-10-05|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Flapping==\n[[File:Memphis_Tigers_Flag_video_2011-02-20.theora.ogv|thumb|Video of flag flapping]]\nWhen blown by the wind, flags are subject to wave-like motions that grow in amplitude along the length of the flag. This is sometimes ascribed to the flag pole giving [[vortex shedding]]; however, flags that are held by [[lanyard]]s also can be seen to flap.\n\n==See also==\n;Lists and galleries of flags\n* [[Gallery of sovereign state flags]]\n* [[List of flag names]]\n* [[Lists of flags]]\n* [[Timeline of national flags]]\n* [[Unofficial flags]]\n\n;Notable flag-related topics\n* [[False flag]]\n* [[Flag Day]]\n* [[Flag desecration]]\n* [[Flag protocol]]\n* [[Flag patch]]\n* [[Flag semaphore]]\n* [[Flag throwing]]\n* [[Glossary of vexillology]]\n* [[Pledge of Allegiance (United States)]]\n* [[Standard-bearer]] (also enumerates various types of standards, both flag types and immobile ensigns)\n* [[Vexillology]]\n* [[Flags of the World]], an Internet-based vexillological association and resource\n* [[Windsock]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n{{refbegin}}\n{{refend}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|Flags}}\n{{Wikidata property |P163}}\n* [http://www.anbg.gov.au/flags/signal-flags.html International Marine Signal Flags]\n{{Lists of flags}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Flags| ]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n[[Category:National symbols]]\n[[Category:Vexillology]]", "sha1": "jv0wdzkdnyddubs740nxemmh5og8t0m"}}, {"title": "Father Dougal McGuire", "ns": "0", "id": "11425", "revision": {"id": "860884188", "parentid": "860884139", "timestamp": "2018-09-23T18:26:55Z", "contributor": {"ip": "89.101.250.169"}, "comment": "/* Fictional character biography */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Infobox character\n| colour           = \n| colour text      = \n| name             = Father Dougal McGuire\n| series           = [[Father Ted]]\n| image            = Father Dougal McGuire portrait.jpg\n| image_size       = 200px\n| alt              = A publicity photograph of Irish actor Ardal O'Hanlon as Father Dougal McGuire\n| caption          = Ardal O'Hanlon as Father Dougal\n| first            = \"[[\"Good Luck, Father Ted\"|'Good Luck, Father Ted']]\" (1995)\n| last             = \"[[Going to America]]\" (1998)\n| creator          = {{plainlist|\n*[[Arthur Mathews (writer)|Arthur Mathews]]\n*[[Graham Linehan]]\n}}\n| portrayer        = [[Ardal O'Hanlon]]\n| fullname         = \n| occupation       = Curate\n| family           = \n| relatives        = \n| religion         = Roman Catholic\n| nationality      = Irish\n}}\n\n'''Father Dougal McGuire''' is a character in the [[Channel 4]] sitcom ''[[Father Ted]]''. Created by [[Arthur Mathews (writer)|Arthur Mathews]] and [[Graham Linehan]], Dougal was portrayed by comedian [[Ardal O'Hanlon]] for the programme's three series. The character is a childlike, simple-minded [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[Curate|curate]] exiled to Craggy Island, a small island off the coast of [[Galway]].\n\nDougal originated as an [[unseen character]] in a short-lived stand-up routine performed by Mathews in the late 1980s. Portraying an early version of [[Father Ted Crilly]] on-stage, Mathews occasionally discussed Dougal as one of Ted's great friends. In 1994, the writers took ''Father Ted'' to television, casting O'Hanlon as the on-screen Dougal.\n\n==Concept and creation==\nArthur Mathews created the character of Father Ted while working at ''Hot Press'' in 1987\u201389. During production weekends, he and Paul Woodfull had the idea for The Joshua Trio, a comedic [[U2]] tribute band. The band performed various warm-up sketches written by Mathews, Woodfull, and Graham Linehan, who joined in a non-musical capacity. These sketches included stand-up performed by Mathews in-character as Father Ted Crilly. As Ted, Mathews sometimes read from a book, ''Notes from Africa'', purportedly written by Father Dougal McGuire, a missionary friend who described his experiences of being attacked and chased by natives. In one sketch, Ted discussed his concern for Dougal, who had been voted Most Unpopular Priest in Africa for two years running and was spending Christmas up a tree in the grounds of The Bob Geldof Centre.<ref name=\"MartinDoyle\"/>\n\nIn 1990, Linehan and Mathews began writing ''Irish Lives'', a six-part comedy television series. The show would have taken the form of a [[mockumentary]], with each episode focusing on interviewing a different character, one of whom was Father Ted Crilly. The story involved Ted returning to his [[seminary]] to catch up with old friends. When producer [[Geoffrey Perkins]] asked Linehan and Mathews to discard the mockumentary format and expand the Father Ted episode to a traditional sitcom, Father Dougal became one of the main characters.<ref name=\"ComedyConnections\"/> When writing Dougal, Linehan and Mathews drew on [[Stan Laurel]], incorporating some of Linehan's own behaviour during moments of confusion.\n\n==Casting==\nLinehan and Mathews saw O'Hanlon in a modernised Shakespeare play broadcast by RT\u00c9, and were impressed by the \"weird, gormless\" face he could pull. Linehan later said, \"That was Dougal right there. He was just spot-on and he became our secret weapon. The show took off so quickly because Ardal was so instantly funny.\"<ref name=\"Guardian20\"/> The writers have said that the only other actor they feel might have worked in the role is [[Don Wycherley]], who plays Dougal's Rugged Island counterpart, Father Cyril McDuff, in the show.<ref name=\"2012commentaries\"/>\n\nThere have been several attempts to remake the show for American audiences. In 2004, it was reported that [[Graham Norton]] (who played Father Noel Furlong in ''Father Ted'') had signed on to play Dougal alongside [[Steve Martin]] as Ted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.supanet.com/cgi-bin/news/showfeed.pl?id=1079275308-2&area=entertainment |title=Martin And Norton Team Up Martin And Norton Team Up |publisher=[[Supanet Limited]] |date=14 March 2004 |accessdate=28 December 2014 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040423160956/http://www.supanet.com/cgi-bin/news/showfeed.pl?id=1079275308-2&area=entertainment |archivedate=April 23, 2004 }}</ref> No remake has yet entered production.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nReferences to Dougal's family are rare. In \"[[Grant Unto Him Eternal Rest]]\", he mentions that his parents are dead, and also refers to an uncle who died after his heart stopped beating for a week. It is unclear how Dougal entered the priesthood, with Ted wondering, \"Dougal, how did you get into the Church? Was it, like, collect twelve crisp packets and become a priest?\"\n\nBy the time the show begins, Dougal has been exiled to Craggy Island as punishment for unknown misdeeds. In an early interview, the writers stated that it involved \"a baptism gone wrong\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/arts-television-in-the-name-of-the-father-1616814.html|title=In the name of the FatherIn the name of the Father|last=Thompson|first=Ben|publisher=''[[The Independent]]''|date=22 April 1995|accessdate=9 April 2016}}</ref> In \"[[The Passion of Saint Tibulus]]\", Bishop Brennan says that Dougal cannot be allowed back into \"the real world\" after \"the Blackrock incident\", in which hundreds of nuns' lives were \"irreparably damaged\".\n\nDougal is also famously known for wearing a [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Ireland soccer]] jersey when he is in bed.\n\nOn the [http://www.channel4.com/programmes/father-ted Channel 4 website] for Father Ted, the profile for Father Dougal states that 'Dougal was relegated to the island after an unfortunate incident on a [[Sealink|SeaLink]] ferry that put the lives of hundreds of nuns in danger.'<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/father-ted/profiles/all/father-dougal/256|title=Father Ted - profiles - Father Dougal - All 4|website=www.channel4.com|access-date=2016-12-31}}</ref>\n\nIn \"[[Old Grey Whistle Theft]]\", Dougal mentions that he is 25 years old.\n\n==Personality==\nIn the 2011 documentary ''Unintelligent Design'', Linehan said that Dougal had been conceived as a cross between wide-eyed bartender [[Woody Boyd|Woody]] in ''[[Cheers]]'' and roadsweeper [[Trigger (Only Fools and Horses)|Trigger]] in ''[[Only Fools and Horses]]''.<ref name=\"UnintelligentDesign\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/film-tv/news/father-ted-cocreator-reveals-inspiration-for-dougal-15042758.html|title=Father Ted co-creator reveals inspiration for Dougal|date=2001-12-31|work=Belfast Telegraph|accessdate=2011-01-05}}</ref> In another interview, they mentioned [[Latka Gravas]] from ''[[Taxi (TV series)|Taxi]]'' as an influence and compared the relationship between Ted and Dougal to that between [[Don Quixote]] and [[Sancho Panza]]: \"Alongside the wily priest who would lie at the drop of a hat we wanted a gormless idiot who was the very model of innocence.\"<ref name=\"RTE2011\"/>\n\nFor his portrayal of Dougal, O'Hanlon turned to [[Laurel and Hardy]] and ''[[Fawlty Towers]]''{{'}}s bumbling waiter [[Manuel (Fawlty Towers)|Manuel]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RXgUzCJ4uU|title=Ardal O'Hanlon Talks About Father Ted.|publisher=[[YouTube]]|date=11 November 2009|accessdate=25 December 2012}}</ref> O'Hanlon also drew inspiration from his child sister, as well as dogs, explaining: \"Dougal had to be more than just stupid. He had to be otherworldly and very, very strange. I saw Dougal as very doglike, very puppyish and lovable, and really loyal to Ted.\"<ref name=\"Guardian20\"/>\n\n==Reception and legacy==\nAfter the first episode aired, Ben Thompson of ''[[The Independent]]'' singled out O'Hanlon as \"the real star of the show\", and said that Dougal's \"holy-fool innocence\" as \"worthy of [[James Stewart]]\". Writing for the ''[[Irish Examiner]]'', Ed Power said that while the \"[[Internet meme|meme]]-worthy\" Dougal and Jack received the most attention at the time of broadcast, Morgan's straight-man performance was the highlight in retrospect.<ref name=\"IrishExaminerGreatest\"/> Morgan attributed the show's success to the appealing double-act formed by Dougal, \"an idiot who knows nothing\", and Ted, \"an idiot who thinks he knows something but actually knows nothing.\"<ref name=\"IndependentMorgan\"/>\n\nAs testament to the character's enduring popularity, Irish bookmakers humorously began collecting bets on whether Dougal would succeed Pope [[John Paul II]] upon his death. The odds were 1,000-1<ref>{{Cite news|title = Betting on the next Pope|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/2540369.stm|newspaper = BBC|date = 2002-12-05|access-date = 2015-09-05}}</ref> (better odds than some genuine candidates), and some small stakes were actually received.\n\nIn 2001, O'Hanlon reprised the role of Dougal for a series of [[PBS]] advertisements to coincide with ''Father Ted''{{'}}s American broadcast; these segments were included on later DVD releases as \"Fundraising with Father Dougal\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktsmKO97b44|title=Dougal Maguire|publisher=[[YouTube]]|date=30 December 2006|accessdate=17 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbcamericashop.com/dvd/father-ted-the-holy-trilogy-11095.html|title=Father Ted: The Holy Trilogy|work=bbcamericashop.com|accessdate=17 February 2013}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"2012commentaries\">{{cite AV media|last1=Linehan |first1=Graham |authorlink1=Graham Linehan |last2=Mathews |first2=Arthur |authorlink2=Arthur Mathews (writer) |year=2012 |title=Father Ted DVD Commentaries |type=Podcast |language=English |url=http://www.podcasts.com/father_ted_dvd_commentaries/ |accessdate=19 June 2015 |format=mp3 |location=London |publisher=podcasts.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703184945/http://www.podcasts.com/father_ted_dvd_commentaries |archivedate=3 July 2015 |df= }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"ComedyConnections\">{{Cite episode|title=\"Father Ted\"|access-date=19 June 2015|series=''[[Comedy Connections]]''|network=[[BBC One]]|date=12 July 2004|series-no=2|language=English}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Guardian20\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/apr/20/father-ted-legacy-20-years-on-up-with-this-sort-of-thing|title=Father Ted's legacy, 20 years on: up with this sort of thing|last=Harrison|first=Andrew|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|date=20 April 2015|accessdate=3 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"IndependentMorgan\">{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/interview-dermot-morgan-my-life-as-a-priest-1236417.html|title=Interview: Dermot Morgan;

The population was 1,831,000 in the 2010 census and the largest town is [[Maumere]]. The name ''Flores'' is derived from the  [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for \"flowers\".\n\nFlores is located east of [[Sumbawa]] and [[Komodo (island)|Komodo]] and west of [[Lembata]] and the [[Alor Archipelago]]. To the southeast is [[Timor]]. To the south, across the Sumba Strait, is [[Sumba]] island and to the north, beyond the [[Flores Sea]], is [[Sulawesi]].\n\nAmong all islands containing Indonesian territory, Flores is the 10th most populous after [[Java]], [[Sumatra]], [[Borneo]] ([[Kalimantan]]), [[Sulawesi]], [[New Guinea]], [[Bali]], [[Madura]], [[Lombok]], and [[Timor]] and also the [[List of islands by area|10th biggest island of Indonesia]].\n\n==Etymology==\nUnlike most islands in the Indonesian archipelago, the name ''Flores'' was given by the Portuguese, from ''Cabo de Flores'' (Cape of Flowers), the Portuguese term for the eastern part of the island. This part of the island, originally called Kopondai, was so named by the Portuguese because of the flowering ''[[Delonix regia]]'' trees found there.<ref>Flores, Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica</ref> The original name of Flores was ''Nipa'', referring to the serpent.\n\n==History==\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Bewoner uit Ende op Flores staat klaar voor de jacht of de strijd TMnr 60028899.jpg|thumb|left|Indigenous warrior from [[Ende, Indonesia|Ende]], Flores.]]\n\n[[Portugal|Portuguese]] traders and missionaries came to Flores in the 16th century, mainly to [[Larantuka]] and [[Sikka Regency|Sikka]]. Their influence is still discernible in Sikka's language, culture and religion. The first Portuguese visit took place in 1511, through the expedition of [[Ant\u00f3nio de Abreu]] and his vice-captain [[Francisco Serr\u00e3o]], en route through the Sunda islands.\n\nThe [[Dominican order]] was extremely important in this island, as well as in the neighbouring islands of [[Timor]] and [[Solor]]. When in 1613 the Dutch attacked the Fortress of Solor, the population of this fort, led by the Dominicans, moved to the harbor town of [[Larantuka]], on the eastern coast of Flores. This population was mixed, of Portuguese and local islanders descent and Larantuqueiros, [[Topasses]] or, as Dutch knew them, the 'Black Portuguese' (Zwarte Portuguezen).\n\nThe Larantuqueiros or Topasses became the dominant sandalwood trading people of the region for the next 200 years. This group used Portuguese as the language for worship, Malay as the language of trade and a mixed dialect as mother tongue. This was observed by [[William Dampier]], an English privateer visiting the Island in 1699:\n\n:''These [the Topasses] have no Forts, but depend on their Alliance with the Natives: And indeed they are already so mixt, that it is hard to distinguish whether they are Portuguese or Indians. Their Language is Portuguese; and the religion they have, is Romish. They seem in Words to acknowledge the King of Portugal for their Sovereign; yet they will not accept any Officers sent by him. They speak indifferently the Malayan and their own native Languages, as well as Portuguese.''<ref name=\"Out of the Ashes - Chapter 1\">{{cite web|url=http://epress.anu.edu.au/oota/ch1.htm |title=Out of the Ashes - Chapter 1 |website=Epress.anu.edu.au |date=1914-06-25 |accessdate=2012-07-25}}</ref>\n\nIn 1846, Dutch and Portuguese initiated negotiations towards delimiting the territories but these negotiations led nowhere. In 1851 Lima Lopes, the new governor of Timor, Solor and Flores, agreed to sell eastern Flores and the nearby islands to the Dutch in return for a payment of 200,000 [[Dutch guilder|Florins]] in order to support his impoverished administration. Lima Lopes did so without the consent of Lisbon and was dismissed in disgrace, but his agreement was not rescinded and in 1854 Portugal ceded all its historical claims on Flores. After this, Flores became part of the territory of [[Dutch East Indies]].\n\nDuring [[World War II]] a Japanese invasion force landed at Reo on 14 May 1942 and occupied Flores.<ref>{{cite web|first = Klemen | last = L |url= http://www.dutcheastindies.webs.com/lesser_sunda.html |title= The Lesser Sunda Islands 1941-1942 |date=1999\u20132000 |work=Forgotten Campaign: The Dutch East Indies Campaign 1941-1942}}</ref>\n\nAfter the war Flores became part of independent [[Indonesia]].<ref name=\"Out of the Ashes - Chapter 1\"/>\n\n[[1992 Indonesia earthquake|On 12 December 1992, an earthquake]] measuring 7.8 on the [[Richter magnitude scale|Richter scale]] occurred, killing 2,500 people in and around Maumere, including islands off the North coast.\n\nIn 2017 two men were killed in Flores due to land disputes between warrior clans; the Mbehel, a [[West Mangarrai]] mountain tribe, and the [[Rangko]] from [[Sulawesi]] island who helped build [[Manggarai]] and were given land near Labuan Bajo by the Manggarai king.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/deadly-trouble-for-surf-pioneer-in-indonesias-new-paradise/news-story/690b0036a934168e92dc23498b455e74|title=Subscribe to The Australian - Newspaper home delivery, website, iPad, iPhone & Android apps|website=Theaustralian.com.au|accessdate=17 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Administration==\nFlores is part of the [[East Nusa Tenggara]] province.

In the centre of the island in the districts of [[Ngada]], [[Nagekeo]], and [[Ende Regency|Ende]] there is what is variously called the Central Flores Dialect Chain or the Central Flores Linkage. Within this area there are slight [[linguistics|linguistic]] differences in almost every village. At least six separate languages are identifiable. These are from west to east: [[Ngadha]], [[Nage]], [[Keo language|Keo]], [[Li'o language|Ende]], [[Lio language|Lio]] and [[Palu'e language|Palu'e]], which is spoken on the island with the same name of the north coast of Flores. Locals would probably also add [[So'a]] and [[Bajawa]] to this list, which anthropologists have labeled dialects of Ngadha.\n\nThe peoples of Flores are almost entirely [[Roman Catholic]] [[Christianity|Christians]], whereas most other Indonesians are [[Islam|Muslim]]. As a consequence, Flores may be regarded as surrounded by a [[geography of religion|religious border]]. The prominence of Catholicism on the island results from its [[the Portuguese in Indonesia|colonisation by Portugal]]. In other parts of Indonesia with significant Christian populations, such as the [[Maluku Islands]] and [[Sulawesi]], the geographical divide is less rigid and Muslims and Christians sometimes live side by side. Flores thereby also has less [[Religion in Indonesia#Summary|religious violence]] that has sporadically occurred in other parts of Indonesia. There are several churches on the island.\n\n==Tourism==\n[[File:BenaVillage.jpg|thumb|Bena Village]]\n[[File:LabuhanBajoHarbour.JPG|thumb|Harbour of Labuhan Bajo on the west coast]]\nThe most famous tourist attraction in Flores is the {{convert|1639|m|ft|adj=mid|abbr=off|-high}} [[Kelimutu]] volcano which containing three colored lakes, located in the district of Ende close to the town of [[Moni]], although you can also visit [[Inierie]] vulcano near [[Bajawa]] town. These [[crater lake]]s are in the caldera of a volcano, and fed by a volcanic gas source, resulting in highly acidic water. The colored lakes change colors on an irregular basis, depending on the oxidation state of the lake<ref>Pasternack. [http://pasternack.ucdavis.edu/kelimutu.htm Keli Mutu Volcanic Lakes], University of California Davis.</ref> from bright red through green and blue.\n\nThere are [[snorkelling]] and [[diving]] locations along the north coast of Flores, most notably [[Maumere]] and [[Riung]]. However, due to the destructive practice of local fishermen using bombs to fish, and locals selling shells to tourists, combined with the after effects of a devastating tsunami in 1992, the reefs have slowly been destroyed.\n\n[[Labuan Bajo]] town located on the western tip is often used by tourists as a base to visit [[Komodo (island)|Komodo]] and [[Rinca]] islands. Labuan bajo also attracts scuba divers, as [[whale sharks]] inhabit the waters around Labuan bajo.\n\nThe Luba and Bena villages include traditional houses in Flores, Bena is also noted for its Stone Age [[megalith]]s.\n\n[[Larantuka]], on the isle's eastern end, is known for its [[Holy Week]] festivals.\n\nIn recent years, local tourist firms around [[Kelimutu]] have begun promoting cycling tours around Flores, some of which take up to five or six days depending on the particular program.<ref>Markus Makur, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2016/03/13/bicycle-tours-kelimutu-boost-local-economy.html Bycycle tours of Kelimutu boost local economy'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 13 March 2016.</ref>\n\n==Economy==\nIn addition to tourism, the main economic activities on Flores are agriculture, fishing and seaweed production.

For 23 years, in the longest continuous conflict and greatest naval war of antiquity, the two powers struggled for supremacy, primarily on the [[Mediterranean]] [[island]] of [[Sicily]] and its surrounding waters, and also in [[North Africa]].\n\nThe war began in 264 BC with the Roman [[Battle of Messana|conquest]] of the Carthaginian-controlled [[city]] of [[Messina]] in Sicily, granting Rome a military foothold on the island. The Romans built up a [[navy]] to challenge Carthage, the greatest [[naval power]] in the Mediterranean, for control over the waters around Sicily. In naval battles and [[storm]]s, 700 Roman and 500 Carthaginian [[quinquereme]]s were lost, along with hundreds of thousands of lives. [[Command of the sea]] was won and lost by both sides repeatedly. A Roman invasion of Carthaginian [[Africa]] was destroyed in [[Battle of Bagradas|battle]] and the [[Roman consul]] [[Marcus Atilius Regulus]] was [[Prisoner of war|captured]] by the Carthaginians in 255. In 23 years, the Romans slowly conquered Sicily and drove the Carthaginians to the west end of the island.\n\nAfter both sides had been brought to a state of near exhaustion, the Romans mobilized their citizenry's private wealth and created a new fleet under consul [[Gaius Lutatius Catulus]]. The Carthaginian fleet was destroyed at the [[Battle of the Aegates Islands|Aegates Islands]] in 241, forcing the cut-off Carthaginian troops on Sicily to give up. A peace [[Treaty of Lutatius|treaty]] was signed in which Carthage was made to pay a heavy [[indemnity]] and Rome ejected Carthage from Sicily, [[Sicilia (Roman province)|annexing]] the island as a [[Roman province]].\n\nThe war was followed by a failed [[Mercenary War|revolt]] against the [[Carthaginian Empire]]. The Romans exploited Carthage's weakness to seize the Carthaginian possessions of [[Sardinia]] and [[Corsica]] in violation of the peace treaty. The unresolved strategic competition between Rome and Carthage would lead to the eruption of the [[Second Punic War]] in 218 BC.\n\n==Name==\nThe series of wars between Rome and Carthage took the name \"Punic\" from the [[Latin (language)|Latin]] adjective for Carthaginian, ''Punicus''. This is derived from ''Poeni'' (Carthaginians) and refers to the Carthaginian heritage as [[Phoenicia]]n colonists.<ref name=Sidewellp16>{{harvnb|Sidwell|Jones|1997|p=16}}.</ref> A Carthaginian name(s) for the conflicts does not survive in any records.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\n==Background==\n===Rome===\nRome had recently emerged as the leading [[city-state]] in the Italian Peninsula, a wealthy, powerful, [[expansionism|expansionist]] [[republic]] with a successful citizen army.<ref name=\"VOL22_POLL-REEVES_djvu 1911. p628\">[https://archive.org/stream/EB1911WMF/VOL22_POLL-REEVES_djvu.txt Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica. 1911. \"Rome.\" vol 23 p628.]</ref> Over the past one hundred years, Rome had come into conflict, and defeated rivals on the Italian peninsula, then incorporated them into the Roman political world.

In 270 BC, the Romans regained control of Rhegium and severely punished the survivors of the revolt. In Sicily, the Mamertines ravaged the countryside and collided with the expanding regional empire of the independent city of [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]]. [[Hiero II of Syracuse|Hiero II]], [[tyrant]] of Syracuse, defeated the Mamertines near [[Mylae]] on the [[Longanus River]].<ref>Polybius. ''The Histories'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Polybius/1*.html#9 1:9.7-9.8].</ref> Following their defeat, the Mamertines appealed to both Rome and Carthage for assistance. The Carthaginians acted first, approached Hiero to take no further action and convinced the Mamertines to accept a Carthaginian garrison in Messana. Either unhappy with the prospect of a Carthaginian garrison or convinced that the recent alliance between Rome and Carthage against [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]] reflected cordial relations between the two, the Mamertines, hoping for more reliable protection, petitioned Rome for an alliance. However, the rivalry between Rome and Carthage had grown since the war with Pyrrhus and that alliance was simply no longer feasible.<ref>{{harvnb|Warmington|1993|p=167}}.</ref>\n\nAccording to the historian [[Polybius]], considerable debate took place in Rome on the question as to whether to accept the Mamertines' appeal for help and thus likely enter into a war with Carthage. The Romans did not wish to come to the aid of soldiers who had unjustly stolen a city from its rightful possessors, and they were still recovering from the insurrection of [[Campanian]] troops at the Battle of Rhegium in 271 BC. However, many were also unwilling to see Carthaginian power in Sicily expand even further. Leaving them at Messana would give the Carthaginians a free hand to deal with Syracuse. After the Syracusans had been defeated, the Carthaginian takeover of Sicily would essentially be complete.<ref>Polybius.

[[Siege]]s and land [[blockade]]s were the most common large-scale operations for the regular army. The main blockade targets were the important ports since neither Carthage nor Rome were based in Sicily, and both needed continuous reinforcements and communication with their mainlands.<ref name=Niebuhr.18>{{harvnb|Niebuhr|1844|pp=18\u201319}}.</ref>\n\nThe land war in Sicily began with the Roman landing at Messana in 264 BC. According to Polybius, despite the Carthaginian pre-war naval advantage, the Roman landing was virtually unopposed. Two legions commanded by [[Appius Claudius Caudex]] disembarked at Messana, where the [[Mamertines]] had expelled the Carthaginian garrison commanded by [[Hanno, Messana garrison commander|Hanno]] (no relation to [[Hanno the Great]]).<ref>Polybius.

According to the historian [[Philinus of Agrigentum|Philinus]], this army was composed of 50,000 infantry, 6,000 cavalry, and 60 elephants and partly composed of [[Ligures|Ligurians]], [[Celts]] and [[Iberians]].<ref>{{harvnb|Warmington|1993|pp=171\u2013172}}.</ref><ref>Polybius.

The mercenary army would operate in the open against the Romans, while the strongly fortified cities would provide a defensive base from which to operate.<ref name=War171/>\n\n==Battle of Agrigentum==\n{{Main|Battle of Agrigentum}}\nIn 262 BC, Rome besieged Agrigentum, an operation that involved both consular armies\u2014a total of four [[Roman legion]]s\u2014and took several months to resolve. The garrison of Agrigentum (known to the Greeks as Acragas) managed to call for reinforcements and the Carthaginian relief force, commanded by [[Hanno, son of Hannibal|Hanno]], destroyed the Roman supply base at Erbessus.<ref name=Pol19>Polybius.

Nevertheless, the growing Roman Republic soon understood the importance of Mediterranean control in the outcome of the conflict.<ref>{{harvnb|Zoch|2000|pp=94\u201396}}.</ref>\n\n===Origin of Roman design===\nThe first major Roman fleet was constructed after the victory of Agrigentum in 261 BC. Some historians have speculated that, since Rome lacked advanced naval technology, the design of the warships was probably copied from captured Carthaginian [[trireme]]s and [[quinquereme]]s or from ships that had beached on Roman shores due to storms.<ref>{{harvnb|Lazenby|1996|p=49}}.</ref> According to [[Polybius]], the Romans seized a shipwrecked Carthaginian quinquereme, and used it as a blueprint for their own ships.<ref>Polybius, ''[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Polybius/home.html The Histories]'', I.20\u201321</ref> Other historians have pointed out that Rome did have experience with naval technology, as she patrolled her coasts against [[piracy]].<ref name=Reynolds22>{{harvnb|Reynolds|1998|p=22}}.</ref> Another possibility is that Rome received technical assistance from its seafaring Sicilian ally, Syracuse.<ref name=Reynolds22/> Regardless of the state of their naval technology at the start of the war, Rome quickly adapted.<ref>{{harvnb|Roberts|2006|pp=64\u201365}}.</ref>\n\n===The corvus===\n[[Image:Corvus.svg|thumb|Diagram of a ''[[corvus (weapon)|corvus]]'' [[Naval boarding|boarding device]].]]\n{{Main|Corvus (weapon)}}\nIn order to compensate for the lack of experience, and to make use of standard land military tactics at sea,<ref>{{harvnb|Warmington|1993|p=173}}.</ref> the Romans equipped their new ships with a special [[Naval boarding|boarding]] device, the ''[[corvus (weapon)|corvus]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Wallinga|1956|pp=73\u201377}}.</ref> The Roman military was a land-based army, while Carthage was primarily a naval power. This boarding-bridge allowed the Roman navy to circumvent some of Carthage's naval skills by using their marines to board Carthaginian ships and fight in [[hand-to-hand combat]]. Instead of manoeuvring to [[Ramming|ram]], which was the standard naval tactic at the time, ''corvus'' equipped ships would manoeuver alongside the enemy vessel, deploy the bridge which would attach to the enemy ship through spikes on the end of the bridge, and send legionaries across as boarding parties.<ref name=Starr481/><ref>Polybius.

The addition of the ''corvus'' forced Carthage to review its military tactics, and since the city had difficulty in doing so, Rome had the naval advantage.<ref name=Addington1>{{harvnb|Addington|1990|p=29}}.</ref>\n\n==Battle of Mylae==\n{{Main|Battle of Mylae}}\n[[Image:Aeolian Islands map.png|thumb|left|Location of Mylae (Milazzo) on the coast of northern Sicily.]]\n\nThe Roman fleet, under the command of [[Gaius Duilius]], engaged the Carthaginians, under general [[Hannibal Gisco]], off northern Mylae in 260 BC. Polybius states that the Carthaginians had 130 ships, but does not give an exact figure for the Romans.<ref name=\"1:23\">Polybius. ''The Histories'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Plb.+1.23 1:23].</ref> The loss of 17 ships at the [[Lipari Islands]] from a starting total of 120 ships suggests that Rome had 103 remaining.

In order to avoid the ''corvi'', the Carthaginians were forced to navigate around them and approach the Romans from behind, or from the side. The ''corvus'' was usually still able to pivot and grapple most oncoming ships.<ref name=\"Polybius29\">Polybius.

In the north, the Romans, with their northern sea flank secured by their naval victory at the [[Battle of Mylae]], advanced toward [[Termini Imerese|Thermae]]. They were [[Battle of Thermae|defeated]] there by the Carthaginians under Hamilcar (a popular Carthaginian name, not to be confused with [[Hannibal Barca]]'s father, with the same name) in 260 BC.<ref>Polybius.

Hamilcar continued south to [[Kamarina, Sicily|Camarina]], in Syracusan territory, presumably with the intent to convince the Syracusans to rejoin the Carthaginian side.<ref>{{harvnb|Lazenby|1996|p=75}}.</ref>\n\n==Battles in Sardinia and Corsica==\nIn 259 BC, consul Lucius Cornelius Scipio occupied Aleria in Corsica and probably Olbia in Sardinia. Hanno died while fighting at Olbia. The Romans withdrew because of the arrival of a Carthaginian fleet. Cornelius Scipio celebrated his victories over the Carthaginians and Sardinians with a triumph the following year<ref> Lucio Cornelio Scipione</ref>. During the same year, a naval battle occurred near Sulci. The Carthaginian fleet was defeated and the commander Hannibal Gisco, who abandoned his men and fled to Sulci, was later captured by his soldiers and crucified.\n\n==Continued Roman advance==\n[[Image:Romanadvance.JPG|thumb|upright=1.25|Continued Roman advance 260\u2013256 BC.{{col begin}}\n{{legend|#8E2A76|Roman holdings or advances (arrows)}} {{legend|#D2FDC5|Syracusan holdings}}{{legend|#808080|Punic holdings}}{{col end}}]]\n\nThe next year, 258 BC, the Romans were able to regain the initiative by retaking Enna and Camarina. In central Sicily, they took the town of [[Mytistraton]], which they had attacked twice previously. The Romans also moved in the north by marching across the northern coast toward [[Palermo|Panormus]], but were not able to take the city.<ref>Polybius.

Seeking a swifter end to the war than the long [[siege]]s in Sicily would have provided, Rome decided to invade the Carthaginian colonies of Africa and usurp Carthage's supremacy in the Mediterranean Sea, consequently forcing Carthage to accept its terms.<ref name=Starr481>{{harvnb|Starr|1965|p=481}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Warmington|1993|p=175}}.</ref>\n\n===Battle of Cape Ecnomus===\n{{Main|Battle of Cape Ecnomus}}\nIn order to initiate its invasion of Africa, the Roman Republic constructed a major fleet, comprising transports for the army and its equipment, and warships for protection.

Although the Romans defeated the Carthaginian fleet and were successful in rescuing their army in Africa, a storm destroyed nearly the entire Roman fleet on the return trip; the number of casualties in the disaster may have exceeded 90,000 men.<ref name=War178/> The Carthaginians took advantage of this to attack Agrigentum.

The city of Thermae was captured in 252 BC, enabling another advance on the port city of Panormus. The Romans attacked this city after taking Kephalodon in 251 BC. After fierce fighting, the Carthaginians were defeated and the city fell. With Panormus captured, much of western inland Sicily fell with it. The cities of [[Ietas]], [[Solous]], Petra, and [[Tyndaris]] agreed to peace with the Romans that same year.<ref>{{harvnb|Lazenby|1996|p=116}}.</ref>\n\n===Northwestern expedition===\n{{Main|Battle of Drepana}}\n\nThe next year, the Romans shifted their attention to the north-west. They sent a naval expedition toward [[Lilybaeum]]. En route, the Romans seized and burned the Carthaginian hold-out cities of [[Selinunte|Selinous]] and [[Heraclea Minoa]]. This expedition to Lilybaeum was not successful, but attacking the Carthaginian headquarters demonstrated Roman resolve to take all of Sicily.<ref name=Smith788>{{harvnb|Smith|1854|p=788}}.</ref> The Roman fleet was defeated by the Carthaginians at [[Battle of Drepana|Drepana]], forcing the Romans to continue their attacks from land.

Nevertheless, the Carthaginian faction that opposed the conflict, led by the land-owning [[aristocracy|aristocrat]] [[Hanno the Great]], gained power and in 244 BC, considering the war to be over, started the [[demobilization|demobilisation]] of the fleet, giving the Romans a chance to again attain naval superiority.<ref>{{harvnb|Bagnall|2002|p=80}}.</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Layout parameters -->\n | align             = left\n | direction         = <!-- horizontal (default), vertical -->\n | background color  = <!-- box background -->\n | width             = 280\n | caption_align     = <!-- left (default), center, right -->\n\n<!-- Header -->\n | header_background =\n | header_align      = <!-- center (default), left, right -->\n | header            = Renewed Roman offensive 253\u2013249 BC\n\n<!--image 1-->\n | image1            = Attacksrenewed.JPG\n | width1            =\n | alt1              = Roman attacks 253\u2013251 BC.\n | link1             =\n | thumbtime1        =\n | caption1          = 253\u2013251 BC.\n<!--image 2-->\n | image2            = Attacksrenewed2.JPG\n | width2            =\n | alt2              = Roman attacks 250\u2013249 BC.\n | link2             =\n | thumbtime2        =\n | caption2          = 250\u2013249 BC.\n<!-- and so on, to a maximum of 10 images (image10) -->\n\n<!-- Footer -->\n | footer_background =\n | footer_align      = <!-- left (default), center, right -->\n | footer            = {{col begin}}{{col-2}}\n{{legend|#8E2A76|Roman holdings or advances (arrows)}} {{legend|#D2FDC5|Syracusan holdings}}{{col-2}}{{legend|#808080|Punic holdings (advance: red arrow)}}{{col-2}}{{col end}}\n}}\n{{-}}\n\n==Conclusion==\n===Stalemate in Sicily===\n[[Image:RomeWins.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Carthaginians negotiate peace and withdraw.{{col begin}}\n{{legend|#8E2A76|Roman holdings}} {{legend|#D2FDC5|Syracusan holdings}}{{legend|#808080|Punic holdings (advances: red arrows)}}{{col end}}]]\n\nAt this point (247 BC<ref>{{harvnb|Goldsworthy|2001|p=95}}.</ref>), Carthage sent general [[Hamilcar Barca]] ([[Hannibal Barca|Hannibal]]'s father) to Sicily. His landing at Heirkte (near Panormus) drew the Romans away to defend that port city and resupply point and gave Drepana some breathing room. Subsequent guerrilla warfare kept the Roman legions pinned down and preserved Carthage's toehold in Sicily, although Roman forces which bypassed Hamilcar forced him to relocate to Eryx, to better defend Drepana.<ref name=Smith788/>\n\n===Battle of the Aegates Islands===\n{{Main|Battle of the Aegates Islands}}\nPerhaps in response to Hamilcar's raids, Rome built another fleet (paid for by donations from wealthy citizens). It was this fleet that rendered the Carthaginian success in Sicily futile, as the stalemate Hamilcar produced in Sicily became irrelevant following the Roman naval victory at the [[Battle of the Aegates Islands]] in 241 BC, where the new Roman fleet under consul [[Gaius Lutatius Catulus]] was victorious over an undermanned and hastily built Carthaginian fleet.

Before the war, Carthage had the most powerful navy in the western Mediterranean.]]\n\n{{See also|Roman navy#First Punic War|l1=Roman navy}}\n\nDue to the difficulty of operating in Sicily, most of the First Punic War was fought at sea, including the most decisive battles.<ref name=Niebuhr.18/> But one reason the war bogged down into stalemate on the landward side was because ancient navies were ineffective at maintaining seaward blockades of enemy ports. Consequently, Carthage was able to reinforce and re-supply its besieged strongholds, especially Lilybaeum, on the western end of Sicily. Both sides of the conflict had publicly funded fleets. This fact compromised Carthage and Rome's finances and eventually decided the course of the war.<ref name=Bringmann127>{{harvnb|Bringmann|2007|p=127}}.</ref>\n\nDespite the Roman victories at sea, the Roman Republic lost countless ships and crews during the war, due to both storms and battles. On at least two occasions (255 and 253 BC), whole fleets were destroyed in bad weather; the disaster off Camarina in 255 BC counted 270 ships and 119,280 men lost, the greatest single loss in history.{{harvnb|Lazenby|1996|p=162}}<ref>{{harvnb|Dupuy|1984}}.</ref> One theory is that the weight of the ''corvus'' on the prows of the ships made the ships unstable and caused them to sink in bad weather. Later, as Roman experience in naval warfare grew, the ''corvus'' device was made attachable and detachable due to its impact on the navigability of the war vessels.<ref>{{harvnb|Penrose|2008|p=51}}.</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nRome won the First Punic War after 23 years of conflict and in the end became the dominant naval power of the Mediterranean. In the aftermath of the war, both states were financially and demographically exhausted.<ref name=Bringmann127/> Corsica, Sardinia and Africa remained Carthaginian, but they had to pay a high war indemnity. Rome's victory was greatly influenced by its persistence. Moreover, the Roman Republic's ability to attract private investments in the war effort to fund ships and crews was one of the deciding factors of the war, particularly when contrasted with the Carthaginian nobility's apparent unwillingness to risk their fortunes for the common war effort.\n\n===Casualties===\nThe exact number of casualties on each side is difficult to determine, due to bias in the historical sources.\n\nAccording to sources (excluding land warfare casualties):<ref>Polybius. ''The Histories'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Polybius/1*.html#63 1:63.6].</ref>\n* Rome lost 700 ships (in part to bad weather) with an unknown number of crew deaths.\n* Carthage lost 500 ships with an unknown number of crew deaths.\n\nAlthough uncertain, the casualties were heavy for both sides. [[Polybius]] commented that the war was, at the time, the most destructive in terms of casualties in the history of warfare, including the battles of [[Alexander the Great]]. Analysing the data from the Roman [[census]] of the 3rd century BC, [[Adrian Goldsworthy]] noted that, during the conflict, Rome lost about 50,000 male citizens. This excludes auxiliary troops and every other man in the army without citizen status, who would be outside the head count.<ref>{{harvnb|Goldsworthy|2007|loc=Backcover}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Goodrich|1864|p=75}}.</ref>\n\n===Peace terms===\nThe terms of the [[Treaty of Lutatius]] designed by the Romans were particularly heavy for Carthage, which had lost bargaining power following its defeat at the [[Aegates islands]]. Accordingly, Carthage agreed to:\n* evacuate Sicily and the small islands west of it ([[Aegadian Islands]]).\n* return its prisoners of war without ransom, while paying a heavy ransom of their own.\n* refrain from attacking [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]] and her allies.\n* transfer a group of small islands north of Sicily (the [[Aeolian Islands]] and [[Ustica]]) to Rome.\n* evacuate all of the small islands between Sicily and Africa ([[Pantelleria]], [[Linosa]], [[Lampedusa]], [[Lampione]] and [[Malta]]).\n* pay a 2,200 [[Talent (weight)|talent]] (66 [[tonne]]s/145,000 pounds) of silver indemnity in ten annual instalments, plus an additional indemnity of 1,000 talents (30 tonnes/66,000 pounds) immediately.<ref>Polybius. ''The Histories'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Polybius/1*.html#62 1:62.7-63.3].</ref>\n\nFurther clauses determined that the allies of each side would not be attacked by the other, no attacks were to be made by either side upon the other's allies and both sides were prohibited from recruiting soldiers within the territory of the other. This denied the Carthaginians access to any mercenary manpower from Italy and most of Sicily, although this later clause was temporarily abolished during the [[Mercenary War]].\n\n===Political results===\n[[File:Dishekel hispano-cartagin\u00e9s-2.jpg|thumb|300px|A [[Carthaginian currency|Carthaginian]] [[shekel]], dated 237\u2013227 BC, depicting the Punic god [[Melqart]] (equivalent of [[Hercules]]/[[Heracles]]), most likely with the features of [[Hamilcar Barca]], father of [[Hannibal Barca]]; on the reverse is a man riding a [[war elephant]]]]\nIn the aftermath of the war, Carthage had insufficient state funds. Hanno the Great tried to induce the disbanded armies to accept diminished payment, but kindled a movement that led to an internal conflict, the [[Mercenary War]]. After a hard struggle from the combined efforts of [[Hamilcar Barca]], [[Hanno the Great]] and others, the Punic forces were finally able to annihilate the mercenaries and the insurgents. However, during this conflict, Rome took advantage of the opportunity to strip Carthage of [[Corsica]] and [[Sardinia]] as well.<ref name=Sidewellp16/>\n\nPerhaps the most immediate political result of the First Punic War was the downfall of Carthage's naval power. Conditions signed in the peace treaty were intended to compromise Carthage's economic situation and prevent the city's recovery. The indemnity demanded by the Romans strained the city's finances and forced Carthage to look to other areas of influence for the money to pay Rome.<ref name=Fields,15>{{harvnb|Fields|2007|p=15}}.</ref>\n\nCarthage, seeking to make up for the recent territorial losses and a plentiful source of silver to pay the large indemnity owed to Rome, turned its attention to [[Iberia]]; and in 237 BC, the Carthaginians, led by [[Hamilcar Barca]], began a series of campaigns to expand their control over the [[peninsula]]. Though Hamilcar was killed in 229 BC, the offensive continued with the Carthaginians extending their power towards the [[Ebro valley]] and founding \"[[Cartagena, Spain|New Carthage]]\" in 228 BC. When Carthage besieged the Roman protected town of [[Saguntum]] in 218 BC, it ignited the [[Second Punic War]] with Rome.<ref>{{harvnb|Collins|1998|p=13}}.</ref>\n\nAs for Rome, the end of the First Punic War marked the start of Rome's expansion beyond the Italian Peninsula. Sicily became the first [[Roman province]] ([[Sicilia (Roman province)|Sicilia]]) governed by a former [[praetor]], instead of an ally. Sicily would become very important to Rome as [[Grain supply to the city of Rome|a source of grain]].<ref name=Sidewellp16/> Importantly, [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]] was granted nominal independent ally status for the lifetime of [[Hiero II of Syracuse|Hiero II]], and was not incorporated into the Roman province of Sicily until after it was [[Siege of Syracuse (214\u2013212 BC)|sacked]] by [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus]] during the Second Punic War.<ref>{{harvnb|Allen|Myers|1890|p=111}}.</ref>\n\n==Notable leaders==\n* [[Adherbal (admiral)|Adherbal]], Carthaginian leading admiral\n* [[Appius Claudius Caudex]], Roman consul\n* [[Aulus Atilius Calatinus]], Roman dictator\n* [[Gaius Duilius]], Roman consul\n* [[Gaius Lutatius Catulus]], Roman consul\n* [[Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Asina]], Roman consul\n* [[Hamilcar Barca]], Carthaginian leading general\n* [[Hannibal Gisco]], Carthaginian general\n* [[Hanno the Great]], Carthaginian leading politician\n* [[Hasdrubal the Fair]], Carthaginian general\n* [[Hiero II of Syracuse|Hiero II, tyrant of Syracuse]]\n* [[Lucius Caecilius Metellus (died 221 BC)|Lucius Caecilius Metellus]], Roman consul\n* [[Marcus Atilius Regulus]], Roman consul\n* [[Publius Claudius Pulcher]], Roman consul\n* [[Xanthippus of Carthage|Xanthippus]], Spartan mercenary in the service of Carthage\n* [[Hannibal the Rhodian]], Carthaginian privateer\n\n==Chronology==\n* '''264 BC''': The Mamertines seek assistance from Rome to replace Carthage's protection against the attacks of Hiero II of Syracuse.\n* '''263 BC''': Hiero II is defeated by consul [[Manius Valerius Messalla]] and is forced to change allegiance to Rome, which recognises his position as King of Syracuse and the surrounding territory.\n* '''262 BC''': Roman intervention in Sicily.

The [[Battle of Adys]] is the first Roman success on African soil and Carthage sues for peace. Negotiations fail to reach agreement and the war continues.\n* '''255 BC''': The Carthaginians employ a [[Sparta]]n general, [[Xanthippus of Carthage|Xanthippus]], to organise their defences and defeat the Romans at the [[Battle of Tunis]].

The Romans win a victory at [[battle of Panormus|Panormus]], in Sicily, but fail to make any further progress in the war. Five Greek cities in Sicily defect from Carthage to Rome.\n* '''253 BC''': The Romans pursue a policy of raiding the African coast east of Carthage. After an unsuccessful year the fleet heads for home. During the return to Italy the Romans are again caught in a storm and lose 150 ships.\n* '''251 BC''': The Romans again win at [[Palermo|Panormus]] over the Carthaginians, led by Hasdrubal.

This lull would last until 241 BC.\n* '''244 BC''': With little to no naval engagements, [[Hanno the Great]] of Carthage advocates the demobilisation of large parts of the Carthaginian navy to save money. Carthage does so.\n* '''242 BC''': Rome constructs another major battle fleet.\n* '''241 BC''': On March 10, the Romans secure a decisive victory at the [[Battle of the Aegates Islands]].

By inventing and inserting documents that appear to be factual, an author tries to create a sense of authenticity beyond the normal and expected [[suspension of disbelief]] for a [[work of art]]. The goal of a false document is to convince an audience that what is being presented is factual.\n\n==In business==\nForged documents in business are typically for financial gain.\n\n=== Material certificates ===\nA material's [[Mill Test Report|certification]], essentially a report of its composition and properties, may be forged.  A low-property material, produced for lower cost, may be passed as a higher-property material, which has a higher price.  The difference becomes illicit profit. Counterfeit fasteners have low-strength alloys or inferior production processes, but are sold as high-strength fasteners.\n\n=== Safety certificates ===\nSimilarly, parts, systems, and processes for high-valued operations may have their [[Quality Assurance|quality-assurance documents]] forged.  Substandard items may be cheaper or simply more readily available. Nuclear power plants in Japan and Korea have found components with forged safety documents.\n''See also'': [[Information Assurance]]\n\n=== Degree certificates ===\nAcademic degrees often qualify for recruitment, promotions and additional pay. There are many methods to get false degree certificates. First, university officials have been bribed to issue a certificate without study. Second, false universities called [[diploma mill]]s issue certificates that have no legal standing and are usually purchased outright without study, but they may still be legal. Finally, degree certificates have been directly [[Forgery|forged]], which is a felony in most jurisdictions. Besides the degree certificate itself, final theses and essays have been falsified by e.g. plagiarism, ghost writing or inclusion of fake references. Thus, the degree certificate itself is genuine but it may be revoked.\n\n==In politics==\nA forged document, the [[Zinoviev Letter]], helped bring the downfall of the first [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Government]] in Britain. Conspiracies within secret intelligence services have occurred more recently, leading [[Harold Wilson]]  to put in place rules to prevent in the 1960s [[phone tapping]] of [[members of Parliament]], for example.\n\n''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'', purporting to describe a [[Jew]]ish plan for global domination, was first published in Russia in 1903, translated into multiple languages, and disseminated internationally in the early part of the 20th century.\n\n== In art ==\nArtist [[J. S. G. Boggs|JSG Boggs]]'s life and work have been extensively explored by author and journalist [[Lawrence Weschler]]. Boggs draws currency with exceptional care and accuracy, but he only ever draws one side. He then attempts to buy things with the piece of paper upon which he has drawn the currency. His goal is to pass each bill for its face value in common transactions. He buys lunch, clothes, and lodging in this manner, and after the transactions are complete, his bills fetch many times their face value on the art market. Boggs does not make any money from the much larger art market value of his work, only from reselling the goods bought, the change and receipts and other such materials. He has been arrested in many countries, and there is much controversy surrounding his work.\n\n[[Orson Welles]]' ''[[F for Fake]]'' is a prime example of a film which is both about falsification ([[art forgery]] and the journalism surrounding art forgery) as well as having falsified moments within the film. The movie follows the exploits of a famous art forger, his biographer [[Clifford Irving]], and the subsequent fake [[autobiography]] of [[Howard Hughes]] that Irving tries to publish. The issues of veracity and forgery are explored in the film, while at the same time, Welles tricks the audience by incorporating fake bits of narrative alongside the documentary footage.\n\n==In cross-marketing==\nThere is a long history of producers creating tie-in material to promote and merchandise movies and television shows. Tie-in materials as far-ranging as toys, games, lunch boxes, clothing and so on have all been created and in some cases generate as much or more revenue as the original programming. One big merchandising arena is publishing. In most cases such material is not considered [[canon (fiction)|canon]] within the show's mythology; however, in some instances the books, magazines, etc. are specifically designed by the creators to be canonical.

He also wrote in and translated from English and French.\n\nPessoa was a prolific writer, and not only under his own name, for he dreamed up approximately seventy-five others. He did not call them ''pseudonyms'' because he felt that did not capture their true independent intellectual life and instead called them [[Heteronym (literature)|''heteronyms'']]. These imaginary figures sometimes held unpopular or extreme views.\n\n==Early years in Durban==\n\n[[Image:Fernando Pessoa Largo de S\u00e3o Carlos2035.JPG|thumb|200px|Pessoa's birthplace: a large flat at S\u00e3o Carlos Square, just in front of Lisbon's opera.]]\nPessoa was born in [[Lisbon]] on 13 June 1888. When Pessoa was five, his father, Joaquim de Seabra Pess\u00f4a, died of [[tuberculosis]] and the following year, on 2 January, his younger brother Jorge, aged one, also died.\n\nAfter the second marriage of his mother, Maria Magdalena Pinheiro Nogueira, proxy wedding to Jo\u00e3o Miguel dos Santos Rosa, Fernando sailed with his mother for South Africa in the beginning of 1896, to join his stepfather, a military officer appointed Portuguese [[Consul (representative)|consul]] in [[Durban]], capital of the former British [[Colony of Natal]]. Later on, in 1918, Pessoa wrote a letter in which refers:\n\n[[Image:FP triciclo.jpg|thumb|200px| Last year in Lisbon before moving to Durban, 1894, aged 6.]]\n\n{{bquote \n|There is only one event in the past which has both the definiteness and the importance required for rectification by direction; this is my father's death, which took place on 13th July, 1893. My mother's second marriage (which took place on 30th December, 1895) is another date which I can give with preciseness and it is important for me, not in itself, but in one of its results \u2013 the circumstance that, my stepfather becoming Portuguese Consul in Durban (Natal), I was educated there, this English education being a factor of supreme importance in my life, and, whatever my fate be, indubitably shaping it.\nThe dates of the voyages related to the above event are (as nearly as possible):\n\n1st. voyage to Africa \u2013 left Lisbon beginning January 1896.\n\nReturn \u2013 left Durban in the afternoon of 1st.

He moved to the [[Durban High School]] in April 1899, becoming fluent in English and developing an appreciation for English literature. During the [[Matriculation examination|Matriculation Examination]], held at the time by the University of the Cape of Good Hope (forerunner of the [[University of Cape Town]]), in November 1903 he was awarded the recently created [[Queen Victoria]] Memorial Prize for best paper in English. While preparing to enter university, he also attended the Durban Commercial High School during one year, in the evening shift.\n\n[[Image:Pessoa 1898.jpg|thumb|200px|Pessoa in Durban, 1898, aged 10.]]\n\nMeanwhile, Pessoa started writing short stories in English, some under the name of David Merrick, many of which he left unfinished.<ref name = \"Zenith, Richard 2008\">Zenith, Richard (2008), ''Fotobiografias S\u00e9culo XX: Fernando Pessoa'', Lisboa: C\u00edrculo de Leitores.</ref> At the age of sixteen, ''[[The Natal Mercury]]''<ref>[http://www.themercury.co.za/ ''The Natal Mercury'']</ref> (edition of 6 July 1904) published his poem \"Hillier did first usurp the realms of rhyme...\", under the name of C. R. Anon (anonymous), along with a brief introductory text: \"I read with great amusement...\". In December, ''The Durban High School Magazine'' published his essay \"Macaulay\".<ref>Monteiro, Maria da Encarna\u00e7\u00e3o (1961), ''Incid\u00eancias Inglesas na Poesia de Fernando Pessoa, Coimbra:  author ed.''</ref> From February to June 1905, in the section \"The Man in the Moon\", ''The Natal Mercury'' also published at least four sonnets by Fernando Pessoa: \"Joseph Chamberlain\", \"To England I\", \"To England II\" and \"Liberty\".<ref>Jennings, H. D. (1984), ''Os Dois Exilios'', Porto: Centro de Estudos Pessoanos</ref> His poems often carried humorous versions of [[Anonymity|Anon]] as the author's name. Pessoa started using [[pen names]] quite young. The first one, still in his childhood, was Chevalier de Pas, supposedly a French noble. In addition to Charles Robert Anon and David Merrick, the young writer also signed up, among other pen names, as Horace James Faber, Alexander Search, and other meaningful names.\n\nIn the preface to ''The Book of Disquiet'', Pessoa wrote about himself:\n\n{{bquote|Nothing had ever obliged him to do anything. He had spent his childhood alone. He never joined any group. He never pursued a course of study. He never belonged to a crowd. The circumstances of his life were marked by that strange but rather common phenomenon \u2013 perhaps, in fact, it\u2019s true for all lives \u2013 of being tailored to the image and likeness of his instincts, which tended towards inertia and withdrawal.}}\n\n[[Image:Pessoa13.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Pessoa in 1901, aged 13.]]\nThe young Pessoa was described by a schoolfellow as follows:\n{{bquote |I cannot tell you exactly how long I knew him, but the period during which I received most of my impressions of him was the whole of the year 1904 when we were at school together. How old he was at this time I don\u2019t know, but judge him to have 15 or 16. [...]\n\nHe was pale and thin and appeared physically to be very imperfectly developed. He had a narrow and contracted chest and was inclined to stoop. He had a peculiar walk and some defect in his eyesight gave to his eyes also a peculiar appearance, the lids seemed to drop over the eyes. [...]\n\nHe was regarded as a brilliant clever boy as, in spite of the fact that he had not spoken English in his early years, he had learned it so rapidly and so well that he had a splendid style in that language. Although younger than his schoolfellows of the same class he appeared to have no difficulty in keeping up with and surpassing them in work. For one of his age, he thought much and deeply and in a letter to me once complained of \"spiritual and material encumbrances of most especial adverseness\". [...]\n\nHe took no part in athletic sports of any kind and I think his spare time was spent on reading. We generally considered that he worked far too much and that he would ruin his health by so doing.<ref>Clifford E. Geerdts, letter to ''Dr. Faustino Antunes'', 10 April 1907.

Lisboa: Ass\u00edrio & Alvim, pp. 394\u2013398.</ref>}}\n\nTen years after his arrival, he sailed for [[Lisbon]] via the [[Suez Canal]] on board the \"Herzog\", leaving Durban for good at the age of seventeen. This journey inspired the poems \"Opi\u00e1rio\" (dedicated to his friend, the poet and writer [[M\u00e1rio de S\u00e1-Carneiro]]) published in March 1915, in ''[[Gera\u00e7\u00e3o de Orpheu|Orpheu]]'' nr.1<ref>[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/23620 ''Orpheu'' nr.1]</ref> and \"Ode Mar\u00edtima\" (dedicated to the futurist painter [[Santa-Rita Pintor]]) published in June 1915, in ''Orpheu'' nr.2<ref>{{citation | publisher = [[Project Gutenberg]] | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/23621 | title = Orpheu | issue = 2}}.</ref> by his [[heteronym (literature)|heteronym]] [[\u00c1lvaro de Campos]].\n\n==Adult life in Lisbon==\n\n[[Image:Papel timbrado da Empresa Ibis 1.jpg|thumb|200px|\"Ibis Enterprise\", the first firm established by Pessoa, in 1909.]]\n\nWhile his family remained in South Africa, Pessoa returned to Lisbon in 1905 to study diplomacy. After a period of illness, and two years of poor results, a [[student strike]] against the dictatorship of Prime Minister [[Jo\u00e3o Franco]] put an end to his formal studies. Pessoa became an autodidact, a devoted reader who spent a lot of time at the library. In August 1907, he started working as a practitioner at  R.G. Dun & Company, an American mercantile information agency (currently D&B, Dun & Bradstreet). His grandmother died in September and left him a small inheritance, which he spent on setting up his own publishing house, the \"Empreza Ibis\". The venture was not successful and closed down in 1910, but the name [[ibis]],<ref>Ibe name \"ibis\" has a very long literary tradition: the elegiac poem ''Ibis'' by [[Ovid]] was inspired in the lost poem of the same title by [[Callimachus]].</ref> the sacred bird of [[Ancient Egypt]] and inventor of the alphabet in [[Greek mythology]], would remain an important symbolic reference for him.\n\nPessoa returned to his uncompleted formal studies, complementing his British education with self-directed study of Portuguese culture. The pre-revolutionary atmosphere surrounding the assassination of King [[Carlos I of Portugal|Charles I]] and Crown Prince [[Lu\u00eds Filipe, Prince Royal of Portugal|Lu\u00eds Filipe]] in 1908, and the patriotic outburst resulting from the successful [[5 October 1910 revolution|republican revolution]] in 1910, influenced the development of the budding writer; as did his step-uncle, Henrique dos Santos Rosa, a poet and retired soldier, who introduced the young Pessoa to Portuguese poetry, notably the romantics and symbolists of the 19th century.<ref>{{citation | language = Portuguese | last = Zenith | first = Richard | year = 2008 | series = Fotobiografias do S\u00e9culo XX | title = Fernando Pessoa | place = Lisboa | publisher = C\u00edrculo de Leitores | page = 78}}.</ref>  In 1912, Fernando Pessoa entered the literary world with a critical essay, published in the cultural journal ''A \u00c1guia'', which triggered one of the most important literary debates in the Portuguese intellectual world of the 20th century: the polemic regarding a super-[[Cam\u00f5es]]. In 1915 a group of artists and poets, including Fernando Pessoa, [[M\u00e1rio de S\u00e1-Carneiro]] and [[Almada Negreiros]], created the literary magazine ''[[Gera\u00e7\u00e3o de Orpheu|Orpheu]]'',<ref>{{citation | url = http://purl.pt/12089/2/ | language = Portuguese | title = Orpheu | editor-first = Ant\u00f3nio | editor-last = Ferro | place = Lisboa | date = Jan\u2013Mar 1915 | publisher = Orpheu, Lda. | issue = 1\u20132}}.</ref> which introduced [[modernist]] literature to Portugal. Only two issues were published (Jan\u2013Feb\u2013Mar and Apr\u2013May\u2013Jun 1915), the third failed to appear due to funding difficulties.

The translation of a poem should therefore conform absolutely (1) to the idea or emotion which constitutes the poem, (2) to the verbal rhythm in which that idea or emotion is expressed; it should conform relatively to the inner or visual rhythm, keeping to the images themselves when it can, but keeping always to the type of image.\nIt was on this criterion that I based my translation into Portuguese of Poe\u2019s \u201cAnnabel Lee\u201d and \u201cUlalume\u201d, which I translated, not because of their great intrinsic worth, but because they were a standing challenge to translators.<ref>{{citation | last = Pessoa | first = Fernando | year = 1967 | title = P\u00e1ginas de Est\u00e9tica e de Teoria e Cr\u00edtica Liter\u00e1rias| place = Lisbon | publisher = \u00c1tica | isbn = }}.</ref>}}\n\nIn addition, Pessoa translated into Portuguese some books by the leading [[theosophists]] [[Helena Blavatsky]], [[Charles Webster Leadbeater]], [[Annie Besant]], and [[Mabel Collins]].<ref>\n[http://purl.pt/14427/2/ ''A Voz do Sil\u00eancio''] (The Voice of Silence) at the Portuguese National Library.\n<br/>Besant, Annie (1915), ''Os Ideaes da Theosophia'', Lisboa: Livraria Cl\u00e1ssica Editora.<br/>\nLeadbeater, C.

Pessoa's interest in [[spiritualism]] was truly awakened in the second half of 1915, while translating theosophist books. This was further deepened in the end of March 1916, when he suddenly started having experiences where he became a [[Mediumship|medium]], which were revealed through [[automatic writing]]. On June 24, Pessoa wrote an impressive letter to his aunt and godmother, then living in Switzerland with her daughter and son in law, in which he describes this \"mystery case\" that surprised him.\n\nBesides automatic writing, Pessoa stated also that he had \"astral\" or \"etherial visions\" and was able to see \"magnetic auras\" similar to radiographic images. He felt \"more curiosity than fear\", but was respectful towards this phenomenon and asked secrecy, because \"there is no advantage, but many disadvantages\" in speaking about this. Mediumship exerted a strong influence in Pessoa's writings, who felt \"sometimes suddenly being owned by something else\" or having a \"very curious sensation\" in the right arm, which was \"lifted into the air\" without his will. Looking in the mirror, Pessoa saw several times what appeared to be the [[Heteronym (literature)|heteronyms]]: his \"face fading out\" and being replaced by the one of \"a bearded man\", or another one, four men in total.<ref>{{citation | last = Pessoa | first = Fernando | year = 1999 | title = Correspond\u00eancia 1905\u20131922 | place = Lisbon | publisher = Ass\u00edrio & Alvim | isbn = 978-85-7164-916-3}}.</ref>\n\n[[Image:Carta astral ricardo reis.jpg|thumb|200px|Astral chart of the [[Heteronym (literature)|heteronym]] ''Ricardo Reis'' by Fernando Pessoa.]]\n\nPessoa also developed a strong interest in [[astrology]], becoming a competent astrologist. He elaborated more than 1,500 [[astrological chart]]s, including well-known people like [[William Shakespeare]], [[Lord Byron]], [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Chopin]], [[Robespierre]], [[Napoleon I]], [[Benito Mussolini]], [[Wilhelm II]], [[Leopold II of Belgium]], [[Victor Emmanuel III]], [[Alfonso XIII]], or the Kings [[Sebastian I of Portugal|Sebastian]] and [[Carlos I of Portugal|Charles]] of Portugal, and [[Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar|Salazar]]. In 1915, he created the heteronym ''Raphael Baldaya'', an astrologist who planned to write \"System of Astrology\" and \"Introduction to the Study of Occultism\". Pessoa established the pricing of his astrological services from 500 to 5,000 [[Portuguese real|r\u00e9is]] and made horoscopes of customers, friends and also himself and, astonishingly, of the heteronyms and also of journals as ''Orpheu''.\n\nBorn on June 13, Pessoa was native of Gemini and had Scorpio as rising sign. The characters of the main heteronyms were inspired by the four astral elements: air, fire, water and earth. It means that Pessoa and his heteronyms altogether comprised the full principles of ancient knowledge. Those heteronyms were designed according to their [[horoscope]]s, all including [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], the planet of literature. Astrology was part of his everyday life and Pessoa kept that interest until his death, which he was able to predict with some accuracy.<ref>{{citation | last = Cardoso | first = Paulo | year = 2011 | title = Fernando Pessoa, cartas astrol\u00f3gicas | place = Lisbon | publisher = Bertrand editora | isbn = 978-972-25-2261-8}}.</ref>\n\n[[Image: FP_last_writing.jpg|thumb|300px|Pessoa's last writing: 29-11-1935 <br/>\"''I know not what tomorrow will bring''\". <br/> He died next day, November 30, 1935.]]\n\nAs a [[mysticist]], Pessoa was an enthusiast of [[esotericism]], [[occultism]], [[hermetism]], [[numerology]] and [[alchemy]]. Along with spiritualism and astrology, he also paid attention to [[neopaganism]], [[Theosophy (Boehmian)|theosophy]], [[rosicrucianism]] and [[freemasonry]], which strongly influenced his literary work.

He does not let any thoughts arise when he looks at a flower... the only thing a stone tells him is that it has nothing at all to tell him... this way of looking at a stone may be described as the totally unpoetic way of looking at it. The stupendous fact about Caeiro is that out of this sentiment, or rather, absence of sentiment, he makes poetry.\"{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}\n\nWhat this means, and what makes Caeiro such an original poet is the way he apprehends existence. He does not question anything whatsoever; he calmly accepts the world as it is. The recurrent themes to be found in nearly all of Caeiro's poems are wide-eyed childlike wonder at the infinite variety of nature, as noted by a critic. He is free of [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] entanglements. Central to his world-view is the idea that in the world around us, all is surface: things are precisely what they seem, there is no hidden meaning anywhere.\n\nHe manages thus to free himself from the anxieties that batter his peers; for Caeiro, things simply exist and we have no right to credit them with more than that. Caeiro attains happiness by not questioning, and by thus avoiding doubts and uncertainties. He apprehends reality solely through his eyes, through his senses. [[Octavio Paz]] called him the innocent poet. Paz made a shrewd remark on the heteronyms: In each are particles of negation or unreality. Reis believes in form, Campos in sensation, Pessoa in symbols. Caeiro doesn't believe in anything. He exists.<ref>Paz, Octavio (1983), \"El Desconocido de Si Mismo: Fernando Pessoa\", in 'Los Signos en Rotacion y Otros Ensayos'', Madrid: Alianza Editorial.</ref>\n\nPoetry before Caeiro was essentially interpretative; what poets did was to offer an interpretation of their perceived surroundings; Caeiro does not do this. Instead, he attempts to communicate his senses, and his feelings, without any interpretation whatsoever.\n\nCaeiro attempts to approach Nature from a qualitatively different mode of apprehension; that of simply perceiving (an approach akin to [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] approaches to philosophy). Poets before him would make use of intricate metaphors to describe what was before them; not so Caeiro: his self-appointed task is to bring these objects to the reader's attention, as directly and simply as possible. Caeiro sought a direct experience of the objects before him.\n\nAs such it is not surprising to find that Caeiro has been called an anti-intellectual, anti-Romantic, anti-subjectivist, anti-metaphysical...an anti-poet, by critics; Caeiro simply\u2014is. He is in this sense very unlike his creator Fernando Pessoa: Pessoa was besieged by metaphysical uncertainties; these were, to a large extent, the cause of his unhappiness; not so Caeiro: his attitude is anti-metaphysical; he avoided uncertainties by adamantly clinging to a certainty: his belief that there is no meaning behind things. Things, for him, simply\u2014are.\n\nCaeiro represents a primal vision of reality, of things. He is the pagan incarnate. Indeed, Caeiro was not simply a pagan but paganism itself.<ref>Pessoa, Fernando, Notas Para Recorda\u00e7\u00e3o do Meu Mestre Caeiro ''in Presen\u00e7a'' nr. 30, Jan.-Feb. 1930, Coimbra.</ref>\n\nThe critic Jane M. Sheets sees the insurgence of Caeiro\u2014who was Pessoa's first major heteronym\u2014as essential in founding the later poetic ''personas'': By means of this artless yet affirmative anti-poet, Caeiro, a short-lived but vital member of his coterie, Pessoa acquired the base of an experienced and universal poetic vision. After Caeiro's tenets had been established, the avowedly poetic voices of Campos, Reis and Pessoa himself spoke with greater assurance.<ref>Sheets, Jane M., Fernando Pessoa as Anti-Poet: Alberto Caeiro, ''in Bulletin of Hispanic Studies'', Vol. XLVI, Nr. 1, January 1969, pp. 39\u201347.</ref>\n\n===Ricardo Reis===\nIn a letter to William Bentley,<ref>This letter, to the director of the journal ''Portugal'', was written on 31 October 1924, to announce Pessoa's art journal ''Athena''.</ref>  Pessoa wrote that \"a ''knowledge'' of the language would be indispensable, for instance, to appraise the 'Odes' of Ricardo Reis, whose Portuguese would draw upon him the blessing of [[Ant\u00f3nio Vieira]], as his stile and diction that of [[Horace]] (he has been called, admirably I believe, 'a Greek Horace who writes in Portuguese')\".<ref>Pessoa, Fernando (1999), ''Correspond\u00eancia 1923\u20131935'', ed. Manuela Parreira da Silva. Lisboa: Ass\u00edrio & Alvim, p.53, {{ISBN|972-37-0531-1}}.</ref>\n\nReis, both a character and a heteronym of Fernando Pessoa himself,<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=Marilyn Scarantino|title=Pessoa's Poetic Coterie: Three Heteronyms and an Orthonym|journal=Luso-Brazilian Review|date=1 January 1977|volume=14|issue=2|pages=254\u2013262 |jstor=3513064}}</ref> sums up his philosophy of life in his own words, admonishing, \"See life from a distance. Never question it. There's nothing it can tell you.\" Like Caeiro, whom he admires, Reis defers from questioning life. He is a modern pagan who urges one to seize the day and accept fate with tranquility. \"Wise is the one who does not seek. The seeker will find in all things the abyss, and doubt in himself.\"{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} In this sense, Reis shares essential affinities with Caeiro.\n\nBelieving in the [[Greek mythology|Greek gods]], yet living in a [[Christian]] Europe, Reis feels that his spiritual life is limited and true happiness cannot be attained. This, added to his belief in Fate as a driving force for all that exists, as such disregarding freedom, leads to his [[epicureanism|epicureanist]] philosophy, which entails the avoidance of pain, defending that man should seek tranquility and calm above all else, avoiding emotional extremes.\n\nWhere Caeiro wrote freely and spontaneously, with joviality, of his basic, meaningless connection to the world, Reis writes in an austere, cerebral manner, with premeditated rhythm and structure and a particular attention to the correct use of the language when approaching his subjects of, as characterized by Richard Zenith, \"the brevity of life, the vanity of wealth and struggle, the joy of simple pleasures, patience in time of trouble, and avoidance of extremes\".\n\nIn his detached, intellectual approach, he is closer to Fernando Pessoa's constant rationalization, as such representing the orthonym's wish for measure and sobriety and a world free of troubles and respite, in stark contrast to Caeiro's spirit and style. As such, where Caeiro's predominant attitude is that of joviality, his sadness being accepted as natural (\"My sadness is a comfort for it is natural and right.\"), Reis is marked by melancholy, saddened by the impermanence of all things.\n\nRicardo Reis is the main character of [[Jos\u00e9 Saramago]]'s 1986 novel ''[[The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis]]''.\n\n===\u00c1lvaro de Campos===\n{{Main|\u00c1lvaro de Campos}}\n\n\u00c1lvaro de Campos manifests, in a way, as an hyperbolic version of Pessoa himself. Of the three heteronyms he is the one who feels most strongly, his motto being 'to feel everything in every way.' 'The best way to travel,' he wrote, 'is to feel.' As such, his poetry is the most emotionally intense and varied, constantly juggling two fundamental impulses: on the one hand a feverish desire to be and feel everything and everyone, declaring that 'in every corner of my soul stands an altar to a different god' (alluding to [[Walt Whitman]]'s desire to 'contain multitudes'), on the other, a wish for a state of isolation and a sense of nothingness.\n\nAs a result, his mood and principles varied between violent, dynamic exultation, as he fervently wishes to experience the entirety of the universe in himself, in all manners possible (a particularly distinctive trait in this state being his [[Futurism (art)|futuristic]] leanings, including the expression of great enthusiasm as to the meaning of city life and its components) and a state of nostalgic melancholy, where life is viewed as, essentially, empty.\n\nOne of the poet's constant preoccupations, as part of his dichotomous character, is that of identity: he does not know who he is, or rather, fails at achieving an ideal identity. Wanting to be everything, and inevitably failing, he despairs. Unlike Caeiro, who asks nothing of life, he asks too much. In his poetic meditation 'Tobacco Shop' he asks:\n\n{{bquote|How should I know what I'll be, I who don't know what I am?<br>\nBe what I think? But I think of being so many things!}}\n\n==Summaries of selected works==\n\n===''Message''===\n\n[[Image:1edicao Mensagem 1934.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Mensagem'', first edition, 1934.]]\n\n''Mensagem'',<ref name=\"FPMessagemEdEF2016\">{{cite book |author-last= Pessoa |author-first= Fernando |editor-last= Freitas |editor-first= Eduardo |year=2016 |language= Portuguese \n|title= A Mensagem: Editado por Eduardo Filipe Freitas |website= amazon.com \n|location= |publisher= CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform\n|url= https://www.amazon.com/Mensagem-Editado-Eduardo-Freitas-Portuguese/dp/1535199091/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1473508471&sr=8-2&keywords=eduardo+filipe+freitas\n|isbn= 978-1-535-19909-4}}</ref> written in Portuguese, is a symbolist epic made up of 44 short poems organized in three parts or Cycles:<ref>''Message'', Tr. by [[Jonathan Griffin]], Exeter: Shearsman Books, 2007.</ref>\n\nThe first, called \"Bras\u00e3o\" (Coat-of-Arms), relates Portuguese historical protagonists to each of the fields and charges in the [[Coat of arms of Portugal|Portuguese coat of arms]]. The first two poems (\"The castles\" and \"The escutcheons\") draw inspiration from the material and spiritual natures of Portugal. Each of the remaining poems associates to each charge a historical personality. Ultimately they all lead to the [[Portuguese discoveries|Golden Age of Discovery]].\n\nThe second Part, called \"Mar Portugu\u00eas\" (Portuguese Sea), references the country's Age of Portuguese Exploration and to [[Portuguese Empire|its seaborne Empire]] that ended with the death of [[Sebastian of Portugal|King Sebastian]] at [[Ksar el-Kebir|El-Ksar el Kebir]] (''Alc\u00e1cer-Quibir'' in Portuguese) in 1578. Pessoa brings the reader to the present as if he had woken up from a dream of the past, to fall in a dream of the future: he sees King Sebastian returning and still bent on accomplishing a Universal Empire.\n\nThe third Cycle, called \"O Encoberto\" (\"The Hidden One\"), refers to Pessoa's vision of a future world of peace and the [[Fifth Empire]] (which, according to Pessoa, is spiritual and not material, because if it were material England would already have achieved it). After the Age of Force, (Vis), and Taedium (Otium) will come Science (understanding) through a reawakening of \"The Hidden One\", or \"King Sebastian\". The Hidden One represents the fulfillment of the destiny of mankind, designed by God since before Time, and the accomplishment of Portugal.\n\nKing Sebastian is very important, indeed he appears in all three parts of Mensagem. He represents the capacity of dreaming, and believing that it's possible to achieve dreams.\n\nOne of the most famous quotes from ''Mensagem'' is the first line from ''O Infante'' (belonging to the second Part), which is ''Deus quer, o homem sonha, a obra nasce'' (which translates roughly to \"God wishes, man dreams, the work is born\"). Another well-known quote from ''Mensagem'' is the first line from ''Ulysses'', \"O mito \u00e9 o nada que \u00e9 tudo\" (a possible translation is \"The myth is the nothing that is all\"). This poem refers to  [[Odysseus|Ulysses]], king of [[Ithaca]], as Lisbon's founder (recalling an ancient Greek myth).<ref>\n[http://purl.pt/13966/2/ ''Mensagem''] 1st. edition, 1934, at the Portuguese National Library.</ref>\n\n[[Image:A Aguia.JPG|thumb|200px|left|''A \u00c1guia, journal of the Portuguese Renaissance'', nr. 4, April 1912.]]\n\n===Literary essays===\n\nIn 1912, Fernando Pessoa wrote a set of essays (later collected as ''The New Portuguese Poetry'') for the cultural journal ''A \u00c1guia'' (The Eagle), founded in [[Porto|Oporto]], in December 1910, and run by the republican association Renascen\u00e7a Portuguesa.<ref>Martins, Fernando Cabral (coord.) (2008). ''Dicion\u00e1rio de Fernando Pessoa e do Modernismo Portugu\u00eas''. Alfragide: Editorial Caminho.</ref> In the first years of the [[Portuguese Republic]], this cultural association was started by republican intellectuals led by the writer and poet [[Teixeira de Pascoaes]], philosopher Leonardo Coimbra and historian Jaime Cortes\u00e3o, aiming for the renewal of Portuguese culture through the aesthetic movement called Saudosismo.<ref>The Portuguese Republic was founded by the revolution of 5 October 1910, giving freedom of association and publishing.</ref> Pessoa contributed to the journal ''A \u00c1guia'' with a series of papers: 'The new Portuguese Poetry Sociologically Considered' (nr. 4), 'Relapsing...' (nr. 5) and 'The Psychological Aspect of the new Portuguese Poetry' (nrs. 9,11 and 12). These writings were strongly encomiastic to saudosist literature, namely the poetry of [[Teixeira de Pascoaes]] and [[M\u00e1rio Beir\u00e3o]]. The articles disclose Pessoa as a connoisseur of modern European literature and an expert of recent literary trends. On the other hand, he does not care much for a methodology of analysis or problems in the history of ideas. He states his confidence that Portugal would soon produce a great poet \u2013 a super-[[Cam\u00f5es]] \u2013 pledged to make an important contribution for European culture, and indeed, for humanity.<ref>Pessoa, Fernando (1993). ''Textos de Cr\u00edtica e de Interven\u00e7\u00e3o''. Lisboa: Edi\u00e7\u00f5es \u00c1tica.</ref>\n\n===Philosophical essays===\nThe philosophical notes of young Fernando Pessoa, mostly written between 1905 and 1912, illustrate his debt to the history of [[Philosophy]] more through commentators than through a first-hand protracted reading of the Classics, ancient or modern.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} The issues he engages with pertain to every philosophical discipline and concern a large profusion of concepts, creating a vast semantic spectrum in texts whose length oscillates between half a dozen lines and half a dozen pages and whose density of analysis is extremely variable; simple paraphrasis, expression of assumptions and original speculation.\n\nPessoa sorted the philosophical systems thus:\n\n[[Image:A Mensagem. Fernando Pessoa.jpg|thumb|300px|A passage from his famous poem \"Mar Portugu\u00eas\" from \"Message\", in the city of [[Lagos, Portugal]].]]\n\n# Relative Spiritualism and relative Materialism privilege \"Spirit\" or \"Matter\" as the main pole that organizes data around Experience.\n# Absolute Spiritualist and Absolute Materialist \"deny all objective reality to one of the elements of Experience\".\n# The materialistic [[Pantheism]] of [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]] and the spiritualizing Pantheism of [[Nicolas Malebranche|Malebranche]], \"admit that experience is a double manifestation of any thing that in its essence has no matter neither spirit\".\n# Considering both elements as an \"illusory manifestation\", of a transcendent and true and alone realities, there is [[Transcendentalism]], inclined into matter with [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]], or into spirit, a position where [[Henri Bergson|Bergson]] could be emplaced.\n# A terminal system \"the limited and summit of metaphysics\" would not radicalize \u2013 as poles of experience one of the singled categories \u2013 matter, relative, absolute, real, illusory, spirit. Instead, matching all categories, it takes contradiction as \"the essence of the universe\" and defends that \"an affirmation is so more true insofar the more contradiction involves\". The transcendent must be conceived beyond categories. There ''is one only and eternal example of it.

A lunar eclipse does not occur every month because the Moon's orbit is [[orbital inclination|inclined]] 5.14\u00b0 with respect to the [[ecliptic]] plane of Earth; thus, the Moon usually passes north or south of Earth's shadow, which is mostly restricted to this [[plane of reference]]. Lunar eclipses happen only when the full moon occurs around either [[orbital node|node of its orbit]] (ascending or descending). Therefore, a lunar eclipse occurs approximately every 6 months and often 2 weeks before or after a [[solar eclipse]], which occurs during [[new moon]] around the opposite node.\n\nThe interval period between a new or full moon and the next same phase, a [[Lunar month#Synodic month|synodic month]], averages about 29.53 days. Therefore, in those [[lunar calendar]]s in which each month begins on the day of the new moon, the full moon falls on either the 14th or 15th day of the [[lunar month]]. Because a calendar month consists of a [[whole number]] of days, a lunar month may be either 29 or 30 days long.\n\n==Characteristics==\nA full moon is often thought of as an event of a full night's duration. This is somewhat misleading because [[lunar phase|its phase]] seen from Earth continuously waxes or wanes (though much too slowly to notice in real time with the [[naked eye]]). Its maximum illumination occurs at the moment waxing has stopped. For any given location, about half of these maximum full moons may be visible, while the other half occurs during the day, when the full moon is below the horizon.\n\nMany [[almanac]]s list full moons not only by date, but also by their exact time, usually in [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC). Typical monthly [[calendar]]s that include lunar phases may be offset by one day when used in a different [[time zone]].\n\nFull moon is generally a suboptimal time to conduct [[astronomy|astronomical]] observations because the bright [[moonlight|sunlight reflected]] by the Moon then [[skyglow|outshines]] the [[apparent magnitude|apparently dimmer]] stars.\n\nOn 12 December 2008, the full moon occurred [[apogee|closer]] to the Earth than it had been at any time for the previous 15 years, called a [[supermoon]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2008/09dec_fullmoon.htm|title=Biggest Full Moon of the Year|last=Phillips|first=Tony|work= Science@NASA|date=9 December 2008|accessdate=4 March 2010}}</ref>\n\nOn 19 March 2011, another full supermoon occurred, closer to the Earth than at any time for the previous 18 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2011/16mar_supermoon/|title=Super Full Moon|last=Phillips|first=Tony|work=Science@NASA|date=16 March 2011|accessdate=13 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nOn 14 November 2016, a full supermoon occurred closer to the Earth than at any time for the previous 68 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://science.nasa.gov/news-articles/2016-ends-with-3-supermoons|title=Super Full Moon|last=Phillips|first=Tony|work=Science@NASA|date=14 October 2016|accessdate=13 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Formula ===\nThe date and approximate time of a specific full moon (assuming a circular orbit) can be calculated from the following equation:<ref>{{Cite book| first = Jean | last = Meeus | date= 1998 | title = Astronomical Algorithms | edition = 2nd |isbn = 0-943396-61-1| chapter = Phases of the Moon | pages = 349\u2013354 | publisher = Willmann-Bell | location = Richmond, Virginia}}</ref>\n:<math> d = 20.362000+ 29.530588861 \\times N + 102.026 \\times 10^{-12} \\times N^2</math>\nwhere ''d'' is the number of days since 1 January 2000 00:00:00 in the [[Terrestrial Time]] scale used in astronomical [[Ephemeris|ephemerides]]; for [[Universal Time]] (UT) add the following approximate correction to ''d'':\n: <math>-0.000739 - (235 \\times 10^{-12})\\times N^2</math> days\nwhere ''N'' is the number of full moons since the first full moon of 2000.

Psychologists, however, have found that there is no strong evidence for effects on human behavior around the time of a full moon.<ref>{{cite web|title=Full Moon Effect On Behavior Minimal, Studies Say|date=6 February 2004|work=National Geographic News|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/12/1218_021218_moon.html}}</ref> They find that studies are generally not consistent, with some showing a positive effect and others showing a negative effect. In one instance, the 23 December 2000 issue of the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' published two studies on dog bite admission to hospitals in England and Australia. The study of the [[Bradford Royal Infirmary]] found that dog bites were twice as common during a full moon, whereas the study conducted by the public hospitals in Australia found that they were less likely.   All this is relevant to canine rather than human behavior.\n\n===Full moon names===\nHistorically, [[month]] names are names of moons (lunations, not necessarily full moons) in [[lunisolar calendars]]. Since the introduction of the solar [[Julian calendar]] in the Roman Empire, and later the [[Gregorian calendar]] worldwide, people no longer perceive month names as \"moon\" names. The traditional [[Germanic calendar#Month names|Old English month names]] were equated with the names of the Julian calendar from an early time (soon after [[Christianization of the Anglo-Saxons|Christianization]], according to the testimony of [[Bede]] ca. AD 700).\n\nSome full moons have developed new names in modern times, e.g., the [[blue moon]], and the names \"harvest moon\" and \"hunter's moon\" for the full moons of autumn.\n\n====Harvest and hunter's moons====\n{{anchor|Harvest moon}}{{anchor|Hunter's moon}}\n{{Redirect-multi|2|Harvest moon|Hunter's moon}}\n[[File:harvest moon.jpg|right|thumb|300px|A harvest moon.

Because the moon moves eastward among the stars faster than the sun its meridian passage is delayed, causing it to rise later each day \u2013 on average by about 50.47 minutes.<ref>(1440/(29.531)=50.47 minutes)</ref> The harvest moon and hunter's moon are unique because the time difference between moonrises on successive evenings is much shorter than average. The moon rises approximately 30 minutes later from one night to the next, as seen from about 40 degrees N or S latitude. (This is because a full moon in September appears to move not straight east but north-east in the sky.) Thus, there is no long period of darkness between sunset and moonrise for several days after the full moon,<ref>{{cite web|author1=Larry McNish|title=RASC Calgary Centre - Sunset and Moonrise |url=http://calgary.rasc.ca/sunset_moonrise.htm|date=2007}} This gives a graph showing the effect as seen from Calgary, for the whole of the year 2007.</ref> thus lengthening the time in the evening when there is enough light for men to see to work to get the harvest in.\n\n====Farmers' Almanacs====\nThe ''[[Maine Farmers' Almanac]]'' from c. the 1930s began to publish Native American \"Indian\" full moon names.

They appear in print more widely outside of the almanac tradition from the 1990s in popular publications about the Moon.\n''Mysteries of the Moon'' by Patricia Haddock (\"Great Mysteries Series\", Greenhaven Press, 1992) gave an extensive list of such names along with the individual tribal groups they were supposedly associated with.<ref>repeated in ''The Moon Book'' by Kim Long (1998:[https://books.google.com/books?id=e6-ddrk3nxsC&pg=PA102#v=onepage&q&f=false 102ff.]) Also in ''Llewellyn's 1996 Moon Sign Book'' (1995).\n</ref> Haddock supposes that certain \"Colonial American\" moon names were adopted from [[Algonquian languages]] (which were formerly spoken in the territory of New England), while others are based in European tradition (e.g., the Colonial American names for the May moon, \"Milk Moon\", \"Mother's Moon\", \"Hare Moon\" have no parallels in the supposed native names, while the name of November, \"Beaver Moon\" is supposedly based in the Algonquin).\n\nThe individual names given in ''Farmers' Almanac'' include:{{clarify|date=May 2013}}<!--treating farmersalmanac.com as the primary source for this.

Evidence of this is noted in the dates of [[Passover]] and [[Easter]] in Judaism and Christianity, respectively. Passover falls on the full moon on 15 Nisan of the Hebrew calendar. The date of the Jewish [[Rosh Hashana]] and [[Sukkot]] festivals along with all other [[Jewish holidays]] are dependent on the dates of the new moons.<ref>[[Leviticus]] 23:4-7, 33-35.</ref>\n\n===Intercalary months===\n{{main|Intercalary month}}\nIn lunisolar calendars, an intercalary month occurs seven times in the 19 years of the [[Metonic cycle]], or on average every 2.7 years (19/7). In the [[Hebrew Calendar]] this is noted with a periodic extra month of [[Adar]] in the early spring.\n\n==== Blue moon====\n{{further|Blue moon}}\nIn the modern system of \"traditional\" full moon names tied to the [[solstice]] and [[equinox]] points, a supernumerary full moon in such a period is called a blue moon. The term \"blue moon\" used in this sense may date to as early as the 16th century, but it became well known in the United States due to the ''Farmers' Almanac'' (published since 1818).<ref>\nThe saying \"once in a blue moon\" meaning \"very rarely\" is recorded since the 1820s.\nThe term \"blue moon\" is recorded in 1528, in the couplet ''O churche men are wyly foxes [...] Yf they say the mone is blewe / We must beleve that it is true / Admittynge their interpretacion.'' ([[Thomas Wolsey]], ''Rede me and be nott wrothe, for I say no thynge but trothe'' ed. 1871 [https://archive.org/stream/redemeandbenottw00roywuoft#page/n121/mode/2up p. 114]); it isn't clear however if this refers to intercalation.</ref>\n\nAccording to the ''Farmers' Almanac'', a \"blue moon\" is the third full moon in any period between either solstice and equinox, or between equinox and solstice, (calculated using the [[mean tropical year]]), which contains four full moons.<ref>Farmers' Almanac, \"What is a blue moon?\", 24 August 2009, available at [http://farmersalmanac.com/astronomy/2009/08/24/what-is-a-blue-moon].</ref> These seasons are equal in length, unlike the astronomical ones, which vary in length depending on the Earth's speed in its elliptical orbit round the sun.   To compare, in 1983 the equal length seasons began at 1.48 AM on 23 March, 9.15 AM on 22 June, 4.42 PM on 21 September and 12.10 AM on 22 December, while the astronomical seasons began at 4.39 AM on 21 March, 11.09 PM on 21 June, 2.42 PM on 23 September and 10.30 AM on 22 December (all times GMT).   Due to a misinterpretation of this definition in the March 1946 ''[[Sky & Telescope]]'' magazine, \"blue moon\" has also been used in the sense of \"the second full moon in any month which contains two full moons (this usage has been noted as \"erroneous\" by ''Sky & Telescope'' in 1999).<ref>[http://www.skyandtelescope.com/observing/objects/moon/3304131.html ''Sky and Telescope'' \"What's a blue moon?\"]</ref>\nAccording to either definition, \"blue moons\" occur with the average frequency of intercalary months, seven times in 19 years, the ''Farmers' Almanac'' system of \"full moon names\" effectively defining a lunisolar calendar.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Moon}}\n* [[Lunar eclipse]]\n* [[Lunar phase]]\n* [[Month]]\n* [[Near side of the Moon]]\n* [[New moon]]\n* [[Orbit of the Moon]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Full moon}}\n* [http://stardate.org/nightsky/moon/ Moon phase calculator]\n* {{youtube|n2MtEsrcTTs|Neil Young - Harvest Moon}}\n\n{{The Moon}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Full Moon}}\n[[Category:Full moon| ]]\n[[Category:Phases of the Moon]]\n[[Category:Observational astronomy]]", "sha1": "2cxcysy3qceuh297a0a8ywz6pu5d0w8"}}, {"title": "Film format", "ns": "0", "id": "11433", "revision": {"id": "848910345", "parentid": "848891561", "timestamp": "2018-07-05T05:43:27Z", "contributor": {"username": "Lopifalko", "id": "11116033"}, "minor": "", "comment": "/* See also */ Update wikilink", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2012}}\n[[File:Kodak-Max-400-35mm-Film.jpg|link=File:Kodak-Max-400-35mm-Film.jpg|upright|thumb|A cartridge of [[Kodak]] [[35mm format|35 mm (135)]] film for cameras.]]\nA '''film format''' is a technical definition of a set of standard characteristics regarding image capture on [[photographic film]], for either stills or [[filmmaking]].

These were spooled with the emulsion facing outward, rather than inward as in film designed for native roll-film cameras. Types 106 to 114 were for [[George Eastman|Eastman]]-[[William H. Walker (photography)|Walker]] rollholders, while types 50 to 54 were for [[Graflex]] rollholders.\n\nThe primary reason there were so many different negative formats in the early days was that prints were made by [[contact print|contact]], without use of an [[enlarger]]. The film format would thus be exactly the same as the size of the print\u2014so if you wanted large prints, you would have to use a large camera and corresponding film format.\n\n=== Roll film cross-reference table ===\n\nBefore World War II, each film manufacturer used its own system of numbering for the various sizes of rollfilms they made. The following sortable table shows the corresponding numbers. A blank space means that manufacturer did not make film in that size. Two numbers in one box refers to films available with different numbers of exposures, usually 6 and either 10 or 12. Spool length is measured between inner faces of the flanges; several films of the same image size were available on different spools to fit different cameras.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable sortable\"\n|-\n!

''Apparent'' FTL is not excluded by [[general relativity]]; however, any apparent FTL physical plausibility is speculative. Examples of apparent FTL proposals are the [[Alcubierre drive]] and the [[Wormhole#Traversable wormholes|traversable wormhole]].\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== FTL travel of non-information ==\nIn the context of this article, FTL is the transmission of information or matter faster than ''c'', a constant equal to the [[speed of light]] in a vacuum, which is 299,792,458&nbsp;m/s (by definition of the meter) or about 186,282.397 miles per second. This is not quite the same as traveling faster than light, since:\n* Some processes propagate faster than ''c'', but cannot carry information (see examples in the sections immediately following).\n* Light travels at speed ''c/n'' when not in a vacuum but [[time-of-flight|traveling]] through a medium with [[refractive index]] = ''n'' (causing [[refraction]]), and in some materials other particles can travel faster than ''c/n'' (but still slower than ''c''), leading to [[Cherenkov radiation]] (see phase velocity below).\nNeither of these phenomena violates [[special relativity]] or creates problems with [[causality]], and thus neither qualifies as ''FTL'' as described here.\n\nIn the following examples, certain influences may appear to travel faster than light, but they do not convey energy or information faster than light, so they do not violate special relativity.\n\n=== Daily sky motion ===\nFor an earth-bound observer, objects in the sky complete one revolution around the Earth in one day. [[Proxima Centauri]], the nearest star outside the [[solar system]], is about four [[light-year]]s away.<ref name=\"A2 Student Book\">\n{{cite book\n |author=University of York Science Education Group\n |year=2001\n |title=Salter Horners Advanced Physics A2 Student Book\n |publisher=Heinemann\n |pages=302\u2013303\n |isbn=978-0435628925\n}}</ref> In this frame of reference, in which Proxima Centauri is perceived to be moving in a circular trajectory with a radius of four light years, it could be described as having a speed many times greater than ''c'' as the rim speed of an object moving in a circle is a product of the radius and angular speed.<ref name=\"A2 Student Book\" /> It is also possible on a [[Geostatic orbit|geostatic]] view, for objects such as comets to vary their speed from subluminal to superluminal and vice versa simply because the distance from the Earth varies. Comets may have orbits which take them out to more than 1000 [[Astronomical unit|AU]].<ref>\n{{cite web\n |date=15 April 1996\n |title=The Furthest Object in the Solar System\n |url=http://www.oarval.org/furthest.htm\n |work=Information Leaflet No. 55\n |publisher=Royal Greenwich Observatory\n}}</ref> The circumference of a circle with a radius of 1000 AU is greater than one light day.

At no point does the water leaving the hose ever increase in velocity, but the endpoint of the stream can be moved faster than the water in the stream itself.\n\n=== Apparent FTL propagation of static field effects ===\n{{main|Static field}}\n\nSince there is no \"retardation\" (or [[aberration of light|aberration]]) of the apparent position of the source of a [[gravitation]]al or [[electric]] [[static field]] when the source moves with constant velocity, the static field \"effect\" may seem at first glance to be \"transmitted\" faster than the speed of light. However, uniform motion of the static source may be removed with a change in reference frame, causing the direction of the static field to change immediately, at all distances. This is not a change of position which \"propagates\", and thus this change cannot be used to transmit information from the source. No information or matter can be FTL-transmitted or propagated from source to receiver/observer by an electromagnetic field.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n=== Closing speeds ===\nThe rate at which two objects in motion in a single frame of reference get closer together is called the mutual or closing speed. This may approach twice the speed of light, as in the case of two particles travelling at close to the speed of light in opposite directions with respect to the reference frame.\n\nImagine two fast-moving particles approaching each other from opposite sides of a [[particle accelerator]] of the collider type. The closing speed would be the rate at which the distance between the two particles is decreasing. From the point of view of an observer standing at rest relative to the accelerator, this rate will be slightly less than twice the speed of light.\n\n[[Special relativity]] does not prohibit this. It tells us that it is wrong to use [[Galilean relativity]] to compute the velocity of one of the particles, as would be measured by an observer traveling alongside the other particle. That is, special relativity gives the [[velocity-addition formula|right formula]] for computing such [[relative velocity]].\n\nIt is instructive to compute the relative velocity of particles moving at ''v'' and \u2212''v'' in accelerator frame, which corresponds to the closing speed of 2''v''&nbsp;>&nbsp;''c''.  Expressing the speeds in units of ''c'', \u03b2&nbsp;=&nbsp;''v''/''c'':\n:<math>\\beta_\\text{rel} = \\frac{\\beta + \\beta}{1 + \\beta ^2} = \\frac{2\\beta}{1 + \\beta^2} \\leq 1.</math>\n\n=== Proper speeds ===\nIf a spaceship travels to a planet one light-year (as measured in the Earth's rest frame) away from Earth at high speed, the time taken to reach that planet could be less than one year as measured by the traveller's clock (although it will always be more than one year as measured by a clock on Earth). The value obtained by dividing the distance traveled, as determined in the Earth's frame, by the time taken, measured by the traveller's clock, is known as a proper speed or a [[proper velocity]]. There is no limit on the value of a proper speed as a proper speed does not represent a speed measured in a single inertial frame. A light signal that left the Earth at the same time as the traveller would always get to the destination before the traveller.\n\n=== Possible distance away from Earth ===\n{{main|Space travel using constant acceleration}}\nSince one might not travel faster than light, one might conclude that a human can never travel further from the Earth than 40 light-years if the traveler is active between the age of 20 and 60. A traveler would then never be able to reach more than the very few star systems which exist within the limit of 20\u201340 light-years from the Earth. This is a mistaken conclusion: because of [[time dilation]], the traveler can travel thousands of light-years during their 40 active years. If the spaceship accelerates at a constant 1&nbsp;g (in its own changing frame of reference), it will, after 354 days, reach speeds a little under the [[speed of light]] (for an observer on Earth), and time dilation will increase their lifespan to thousands of Earth years, seen from the reference system of the [[Solar System]], but the traveler's subjective lifespan will not thereby change. If the traveler returns to the Earth, she or he will land thousands of years into the Earth's future. Their speed will not be seen as higher than the speed of light by observers on Earth, and the traveler will not measure their speed as being higher than the speed of light, but will see a length contraction of the universe in their direction of travel. And as the traveler turns around to return, the Earth will seem to experience much more time than the traveler does. So, while their (ordinary) coordinate speed cannot exceed ''c'', their [[proper velocity|proper speed]] (distance as seen by Earth divided by their [[proper time]]) can be much greater than ''c''. This is seen in statistical studies of [[muon]]s traveling much further than ''c'' times their [[half-life]] (at rest), if traveling close to ''c''.<ref>\n{{cite book \n |last1=Sartori |first1=L.\n |year=1976\n |title=Understanding Relativity: A Simplified Approach to Einstein's Theories \n |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gV6kgxrZjL8C\n |publisher=[[University of California Press]]\n |pages=79\u201383\n |isbn=978-0-520-91624-1\n}}</ref>\n\n=== Phase velocities above ''c'' ===\nThe [[phase velocity]] of an [[electromagnetic wave]], when traveling through a medium, can routinely exceed ''c'', the vacuum velocity of light.

The latter association has been shown to be misleading, because the information on the arrival of a pulse can be obtained before the pulse maximum arrives.

Since the stored energy in the barrier is less than the energy stored in a barrier-free region of the same length due to destructive interference, the group delay for the energy to escape the barrier region is shorter than it would be in free space, which according to Winful is the explanation for apparently superluminal tunneling.<ref name=\"WinfulHartman\">{{cite journal |last=Winful |first=Herbert G. |title=Tunneling time, the Hartman effect, and superluminality: A proposed resolution of an old paradox |journal=Physics Reports |volume=436 |issue=1\u20132 |pages=1\u201369 |date=December 2006 |url=http://sitemaker.umich.edu/herbert.winful/files/physics_reports_review_article__2006_.pdf |doi=10.1016/j.physrep.2006.09.002 |bibcode=2006PhR...436....1W }}</ref><ref name=\"WinfulArticle\">For a summary of Herbert G.

If confirmed, this would imply [[special relativity]] is an approximation to a more general theory, but since the relevant comparison would (by definition) be outside the [[observable universe]], it is difficult to imagine (much less construct) experiments to test this hypothesis.\n\n=== Spacetime distortion ===\nAlthough the theory of [[special relativity]] forbids objects to have a relative velocity greater than light speed, and [[general relativity]] reduces to special relativity in a local sense (in small regions of spacetime where curvature is negligible), general relativity does allow the space between distant objects to expand in such a way that they have a \"[[recession velocity]]\" which exceeds the speed of light, and it is thought that galaxies which are at a distance of more than about 14 billion light-years from us today have a recession velocity which is faster than light.<ref name=\"misconceptions\">{{cite news |author1=Lineweaver, Charles H. |author2=Davis, Tamara M. |title=Misconceptions about the Big Bang |publisher=Scientific American |date=March 2005 |url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=misconceptions-about-the-2005-03 }}</ref> [[Miguel Alcubierre]] [http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/0264-9381/11/5/001 theorized] that it would be possible to create an [[Alcubierre drive]], in which a ship would be enclosed in a \"warp bubble\" where the space at the front of the bubble is rapidly contracting and the space at the back is rapidly expanding, with the result that the bubble can reach a distant destination much faster than a light beam moving outside the bubble, but without objects inside the bubble locally traveling faster than light. However, [[Alcubierre drive#Difficulties|several objections]] raised against the Alcubierre drive appear to rule out the possibility of actually using it in any practical fashion. Another possibility predicted by general relativity is the [[wormhole#Traversable wormholes|traversable wormhole]], which could create a shortcut between arbitrarily distant points in space. As with the Alcubierre drive, travelers moving through the wormhole would not ''locally'' move faster than light travelling through the wormhole alongside them, but they would be able to reach their destination (and return to their starting location) faster than light traveling outside the wormhole.\n\nDr. Gerald Cleaver, associate professor of physics at [[Baylor University]], and Richard Obousy, a Baylor graduate student, theorized that manipulating the extra spatial dimensions of [[string theory]] around a spaceship with an extremely large amount of energy would create a \"bubble\" that could cause the ship to travel faster than the speed of light. To create this bubble, the physicists believe manipulating the 10th spatial dimension would alter the [[dark energy]] in three large spatial dimensions: height, width and length.

It maintains the principle that no object can accelerate to the speed of light in the reference frame of any coincident observer.{{citation needed|date=October 2009}}{{clarify|date=October 2009}} However, it permits distortions in [[spacetime]] that allow an object to move faster than light from the point of view of a distant observer.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}{{clarify|date=March 2012}} One such [[distortion]] is the [[Alcubierre drive]], which can be thought of as producing a [[wikt:ripple|ripple]] in [[spacetime]] that carries an object along with it. Another possible system is the [[wormhole]], which connects two distant locations as though by a shortcut. Both distortions would need to create a very strong curvature in a highly localized region of space-time and their gravity fields would be immense. To counteract the unstable nature, and prevent the distortions from collapsing under their own 'weight', one would need to introduce hypothetical [[exotic matter]] or negative energy.\n\nGeneral relativity also recognizes that any means of faster-than-light [[travel]] could also be used for [[time travel]]. This raises problems with [[causality]]. Many physicists believe that the above phenomena are impossible and that future theories of [[gravity]] will prohibit them. One theory states that stable wormholes are possible, but that any attempt to use a network of wormholes to violate causality would result in their decay.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} In [[string theory]], Eric G. Gimon and [[Petr Ho\u0159ava (theorist)|Petr Ho\u0159ava]] have argued<ref>{{cite arXiv |eprint=hep-th/0405019 |title=Over-rotating black holes, G\u00f6del holography and the hypertube |first=Eric G. |last=Gimon |author2=Ho\u0159ava, Petr |year=2004 }}</ref> that in a [[supersymmetric]] five-dimensional [[G\u00f6del metric|G\u00f6del universe]], quantum corrections to general relativity effectively cut off regions of spacetime with causality-violating closed timelike curves. In particular, in the quantum theory a smeared supertube is present that cuts the spacetime in such a way that, although in the full spacetime a closed timelike curve passed through every point, no complete curves exist on the interior region bounded by the tube.\n\n== Variable speed of light ==\n{{Main|Variable speed of light}}\n\nIn [[physics]], the speed of light in a [[vacuum]] is assumed to be a constant. However, [[hypotheses]] exist that the [[speed of light]] is variable.\n\nThe speed of light is a dimensional quantity and so, as has been emphasized in this context by [[Jo\u00e3o Magueijo]], it cannot be measured.<ref>{{cite journal |authorlink=Jo\u00e3o Magueijo |first=Jo\u00e3o |last=Magueijo |author2=Albrecht, Andreas |title=A time varying speed of light as a solution to cosmological puzzles |year=1999 |issue=4 |volume=59 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.59.043516 |journal=Physical Review D |arxiv=astro-ph/9811018 |bibcode=1999PhRvD..59d3516A }}</ref> Measurable quantities in physics are, without exception, dimensionless, although they are often constructed as ratios of dimensional quantities. For example, when the height of a mountain is measured, what is really measured is the ratio of its height to the length of a meter stick. The conventional [[International System of Units|SI]] system of units is based on seven basic dimensional quantities, namely [[distance]], [[mass]], time, [[electric current]], [[thermodynamic temperature]], [[amount of substance]], and [[luminous intensity]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/units.html |title=SI base units |website=The NIST Reference on Constants, Units and Uncertainty}}</ref> These [[units of measurement|units]] are defined to be [[Independent variable|independent]] and so cannot be described in terms of each other. As an alternative to using a particular system of units, one can reduce all measurements to dimensionless quantities expressed in terms of ratios between the quantities being measured and various fundamental constants such as [[Newton's constant]], the speed of light and [[Planck's constant]]; physicists can define at least 26 dimensionless constants which can be expressed in terms of these sorts of ratios and which are currently thought to be independent of one another.<ref>{{cite web |author=John Baez |date=22 April 2011 |url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/constants.html |title=How Many Fundamental Constants Are There? }}</ref> By manipulating the basic dimensional constants one can also construct the [[Planck time]], [[Planck length]] and [[Planck energy]] which make a good system of units for expressing dimensional measurements, known as [[Planck units]].\n\nMagueijo's proposal used a different set of [[units of measurement|units]], a choice which he justifies with the claim that some equations will be simpler in these new units. In the new units he fixes the [[fine structure constant]], a quantity which some people, using units in which the speed of light is fixed, have claimed is time-dependent. Thus in the system of units in which the fine structure constant is fixed, the observational claim is that the speed of light is time-dependent.\n\n== See also ==\n{{main\n |:Category:Faster-than-light travel |l1 = Category:Faster-than-light travel\n |:Category:Faster-than-light communication |l2 = Category:Faster-than-light communication\n}}\n{{Portal|Space|Science fiction}}\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* [[Alcubierre drive]]\n* [[Faster-than-light neutrino anomaly]]\n* [[Intergalactic travel]]\n* [[Krasnikov tube]]\n* [[Superluminal motion]]\n* [[Tachyon]]\n* [[Tachyonic field]]\n* [[Wheeler\u2013Feynman absorber theory]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n; Faster-than-light technologies in [[science fiction]]\n<!-- Add only generic concepts used across science fiction, not technologies from specific fictional universes -->\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* [[Ansible]]\n* [[Hyperdrive]]\n* [[Hyperspace (science fiction)|Hyperspace]]\n* [[Inertialess drive]]\n* [[Jump drive]]\n* [[Jumpgate]]\n* [[Teleportation]]\n* [[Ultrawave]]\n* [[Warp drive]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite journal\n |last=Falla |first=D.

It uses a [[store-and-forward]] system to exchange private (email) and public (forum) messages between the BBSes in the network, as well as other files and protocols in some cases.\n\nThe FidoNet system was based on a number of small interacting programs. Only one of these interacted with the BBS system directly and was the only portion that had to be [[Porting|ported]] to support other BBS software. This greatly eased porting, and FidoNet was one of the few networks that was widely supported by almost all BBS software, as well as a number of non-BBS [[online service]]s. This modular construction also allowed FidoNet to easily upgrade to new [[data compression]] systems, which was important in an era using [[modem]]-based communications over telephone links with high [[long-distance calling]] charges.\n\nThe rapid improvement in modem speeds during the early 1990s, combined with the rapid decrease in price of computer systems and storage, made BBSes increasingly popular. By the mid-1990s there were almost 40,000 FidoNet systems in operation, and it was possible to communicate with millions of users around the world. Only [[UUCP#UUCPNET|UUCPNET]] came close in terms of breadth or numbers; FidoNet's user base far surpassed other networks like [[BITNET]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nThe broad availability of low-cost [[Internet]] connections starting in the mid-1990s lessened the need for FidoNet's store-and-forward system, as any system in the world could be reached for equal cost. Direct dialing into local BBS systems rapidly declined. Although FidoNet had shrunk considerably since the late 1990s, it has remained in use even today{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} despite internet connectivity becoming universally available.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\n[[File:Pre-nodelist \"fido list\" June 1984.jpg|thumb|Hand-compiled list of Fido BBS systems, June 1984. This document formed the basis of the first nodelists.]]\nThere are two major accounts of the development of the FidoNet, differing only in small details.\n\n====Tom Jennings' account====\nAround Christmas 1983, [[Tom Jennings]] started work on a new [[MS-DOS]]\u2013hosted bulletin board system that would emerge as Fido BBS. Jennings set up the system in [[San Francisco]] some time in early 1984. Another early user was John Madil, who was trying to set up a similar system in [[Baltimore]] on his [[Rainbow 100]]. Fido started spreading to new systems, and Jennings eventually started keeping an informal list of their phone numbers, with Jennings becoming #1 and Madil #2.<ref name=baker>Ben Baker, [http://www.fidonet.ca/baker.htm \"Fidonet History\"], 2 May 1987</ref>\n\nJennings released the first version of the FidoNet software in June 1984. In early 1985 he wrote a document explaining the operations of the FidoNet, along with a short portion on the history of the system. In this version, FidoNet was developed as a way to exchange mail between the first two Fido BBS systems, Jennings' and Madil's, to \"see if it could be done, merely for the fun of it\". This was first supported in Fido V7, \"sometime in June 84 or so\".<ref name=tom>Tom Jennings, [http://www.worldpowersystems.com/FidoNet/fidohist1.txt \"FidoNet History and Operation\"], February 1985</ref><ref name=\"bbsdoc\">Jason Scott Sadofsky, \"[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0460402/ BBS: The Documentary]\", FIDONET Episode, 21 May 2005.</ref><ref name=\"byte198410\">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1984-10/1984_10_BYTE_09-11_Databases#page/n353/mode/2up | title=FidoNet, Sidekick, Apple, Get Organized!, and Handle | work=BYTE | date=October 1984 | accessdate=23 October 2013 |author1=Markoff, John |author2=Shapiro, Ezra | page=357}}</ref>\n\n====Ben Baker's account====\nIn early 1984, Ben Baker was planning on starting a BBS for the newly forming computer club at the [[McDonnell Douglas]] automotive division in [[St. Louis]]. Baker was part of the [[CP/M]] [[special interest group]] within the club.<ref>Baker provides details of the club and the SIG at about the 8- to 10-minute mark during BBS interviews by Jason Scott Sadofsky, [https://archive.org/details/20040126-bbs-kaplanbakerfrog1 \"BBS Documentary Interview Collection: Ben Baker, Ken Kaplan, That Old Frog (Ryugen Fisher) Part 1 (2004)\"]</ref> He intended to use the seminal, CP/M-hosted, [[CBBS]] system, and went looking for a machine to run it on. The club's president told Baker that [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] would be giving them a [[Rainbow 100]] computer on indefinite loan, so he made plans to move the CBBS onto this machine. The Rainbow contained two [[Central processing unit|processors]], an [[Intel 8088]] and a [[Zilog Z80]], allowing it to run both [[MS-DOS]] and [[CP/M]], with the BBS running on the latter. When the machine arrived, they learned that the Z80 side had no access to the [[I/O port]]s, so CBBS could not communicate with a [[modem]]. While searching for software that would run on the MS-DOS side of the system, Baker learned of Fido through Madil.<ref name=baker/>\n\nThe Fido software required changes to the serial drivers to work properly on the Rainbow. A porting effort started, involving Jennings, Madil and Baker. This caused all involved to rack up considerable [[Long-distance calling#Categories and charges|long distance charges]] as they all called each other during development, or called into each other's BBSes to leave email. During one such call \"in May or early June\", Baker and Jennings discussed how great it would be if the BBS systems could call each other automatically, exchanging mail and files between them.<ref name=baker/> This would allow them to compose mail on their local machines, and then deliver it quickly, as opposed to calling in and typing the message in while on a long-distance telephone connection. Jennings responded by calling into Baker's system that night and uploading a new version of the software consisting of three files: FIDO_DECV6 (the new version of the BBS program itself), FIDONET, and NODELIST.BBS. The new version of FIDO BBS had a timer that caused it to exit at a specified time, normally at night, and as it exited it would run the separate FIDONET program. NODELIST was the list of Fido BBS systems, which Jennings had already been compiling.<ref name=baker/>\n\nThe FIDONET program was what later became known as a ''mailer''. FIDO was modified to use a previously unused numeric field in the message headers to store a ''node number'' for the machine the message should be delivered to. When FIDONET ran, it would search through the email database for any messages with a number in this field. FIDONET collected all of the messages for a particular node number into a file known as a ''message packet''. After all the packets were generated, one for each node, the FIDONET program would look up the destination node's phone number in NODELIST.BBS, and call the remote system. Provided that FIDONET was running on that system, the two systems would [[Handshaking|handshake]] and, if this succeeded, the calling system would upload its packet, download a return packet if there was one, and disconnect. FIDONET would then unpack the return packet, place the received messages into the local system's storage, and move onto the next packet. When there were no remaining packet, it would exit, and run the FIDO BBS program.<ref>Baker at the 35 minute mark, [https://archive.org/details/20040126-bbs-kaplanbakerfrog1 \"BBS Documentary Interview Collection: Ben Baker, Ken Kaplan, That Old Frog (Ryugen Fisher) Part 1 (2004)\"]</ref>\n\nIn order to lower long distance charges, the mail exchanges were timed to run late at night, normally 4 AM.<ref name=tom/> This would later be known as ''national mail hour'',<ref name=randy/> and, later still, as ''Zone Mail Hour''.\n\n===Up and running===\nBy June 1984 Version 7 of the system was being run in production, and nodes were rapidly being added to the network. By August there were almost 30 systems in the nodelist, 50 by September, and over 160 by January 1985. As the network grew, the maintenance of the nodelist became prohibitive, and errors were common. In these cases people would start receiving phone calls at 4 AM, from a caller that would say nothing and then hang up. In other cases the system would be listed before it was up and running, resulting in long distance calls that accomplished nothing.<ref name=tom/>\n\nIn August 1984 Jennings handed off control of the nodelist to the group in St. Louis, mostly Ken Kaplan and Ben Baker. Kaplan had come across Fido as part of finding a BBS solution for his company, which worked with DEC computers and had been given a Rainbow computer and a [[USRobotics]] 1200bit/s [[modem]].<ref>Kaplan provides details 14 to 16 minute mark during this inverview, [https://archive.org/details/20040126-bbs-kaplanbakerfrog1 \"BBS Documentary Interview Collection: Ben Baker, Ken Kaplan, That Old Frog (Ryugen Fisher) Part 1 (2004)\"]</ref> From then on, joining FidoNet required one to set up their system and use it to deliver a netmail message to a special system, Node 51. The message contained various required contact information. If this message was transmitted successfully, it ensured that at least some of the system was working properly. The nodelist team would then reply with another netmail message back to the system in question, containing the assigned node number. If delivery succeeded, the system was considered to be working properly, and it was added to the nodelist.<ref name=tom/> The first new nodelist was published on 21 September 1984.<ref name=baker/>\n\n===Nets and nodes===\nGrowth continued to accelerate, and by the spring of 1985 the system was already reaching its limit of 250 nodes. In addition to the limits on growth of what was clearly a popular system, nodelist maintenance continued to grow more and more time consuming.<ref name=baker/>\n\nIt was also realized that Fido systems were generally clustered \u2013 of the 15 systems running by the start of June 1984, 5 of them were in St. Louis.<ref name=baker/>  A user on Jennings's system in San Francisco that addressed emails to different systems in St. Louis would cause calls to be made to each of those BBSes in turn.  Local calls were normally free or charged at a low rate.  Additionally, the initial call setup, generally the first minute of the call, was normally billed at a higher rate than continuing an existing connection. Therefore, it would make sense to deliver all the messages from all the users in San Francisco to all of the users in St. Louis in a single call. Packets were generally small enough to be delivered within a minute or two, so delivering all the messages in a single call could greatly reduce costs by avoiding multiple first-minute charges. Once delivered, the packet would be broken out into separate packets for local systems, and delivered using multiple local free calls.\n\nThe team settled on the concept of adding a new ''network number'' patterned on the idea of [[area code]]s.<ref group=N>Details of the sequence of events leading to the new routing scheme differ slightly between accounts.</ref> A complete [[network address]] would now consist of the network and node number pair, which would be written with a slash between them. All mail travelling between networks would first be sent to their local ''network host'', someone who volunteered to pay for any long distance charges. That single site would collect up all the netmail from all of the systems in their network, then re-package it into single packets destined to each network. They would then call any required network admin sites and deliver the packet to them. That site would then process the mail as normal, although all of the messages in the packet would be guaranteed to be local calls.<ref name=baker/>\n\nThe network address was placed in an unused field in the Fido message database, which formerly always held a zero. Systems running existing versions of the software already ignored the fields containing the new addressing, so they would continue to work as before; when noticing a message addressed to another node they would look it up and call that system. Newer systems would recognize the network number and instead deliver that message to the network host. To ensure backward compatibility, existing systems retained their original node numbers through this period.<ref name=baker/>\n\nA huge advantage of the new scheme was that node numbers were now unique only within their network, not globally. This meant the previous 250 node limit was gone, but for a variety of reasons this was initially limited to about 1,200. This change also devolved the maintenance of the nodelists down to the network hosts, who then sent updated lists back to Node 51 to be collected into the master list. The St. Louis group now had to only maintain their own local network, and do basic work to compile the global list.<ref name=baker/>\n\nAt a meeting held in Kaplan's living room in St. Louis on 11 April 1985<ref group=N>In the interviews, Baker says this took place in May.</ref> the various parties hammered out all of the details of the new concept. As part of this meeting, they also added the concept of a ''region'', a purely administrative level that was not part of the addressing scheme. Regional hosts would handle any stragglers in the network maps, remote systems that had no local network hosts. They then divided up the US into ten regions that they felt would have roughly equal populations.<ref name=baker/>\n\nBy May, Jennings had early versions of the new software running. These early versions specified the routing manually through a new ROUTE.BBS file that listed network hosts for each node. For instance, an operator might want to forward all mail to St. Louis through a single node, node 10. ROUTE.BBS would then include a list of all the known systems in that area, with instructions to forward mail to each of those nodes through node 10. This process was later semi-automated by John Warren's NODELIST program.<ref name=tom2>Tom Jennings, [http://www.worldpowersystems.com/FidoNet/fidohist2.txt \"FidoNet History #2\"], 20 August 1985</ref> Over time, this information was folded into updated versions of the nodelist format, and the ROUTES file is no longer used.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbscorner.com/bbsnetworks/fidonet.htm |title=The Fidonet BBS Network |publisher=Bbscorner.com |date=2010-02-10 |accessdate=2014-01-28}}</ref>\n\nA new version of FIDO and FIDONET, 10C, was released containing all of these features. On 12 June 1985 the core group brought up 10C, and most Fido systems had upgraded within a few months.<ref name=tom2/> The process went much smoother than anyone imagined, and very few nodes had any problems.<ref name=baker/>\n\n===Echomail===\nSome time during the evolution of Fido, [[email attachment|file attachments]] were added to the system, allowing a file to be referenced from an email message. During the normal exchange between two instances of FIDONET, any files attached to the messages in the packets were delivered after the packet itself had been up or downloaded. It is not clear when this was added, but it was already a feature of the basic system when the 8 February 1985 version of the FidoNet standards document was released, so this was added very early in Fido's history.\n\nAt a [[sysop]] meeting in Dallas, the idea was raised that it would be nice if there was some way for the sysops to post messages that would be shared among the systems.<ref name=wagner>Wynn Wagner, [http://www.rxn.com/~net282/fidonet.wagner.echomail.txt \"History of Echomail\"], July 1985</ref> In February 1986 Jeff Rush, one of the group members, introduced a new mailer that extracted messages from public forums that the sysop selected, in a manner similar to the way the original mailer handled private messages. The new program was known as a ''tosser/scanner''. The tosser produced a file that was similar (or identical) to the output from the normal netmail scan, however, these files were then compressed and attached to a normal netmail message as an attachment. This message was then sent to a special address on the remote system. After receiving netmail as normal, the scanner on the remote system looked for these messages, unpacked them, and put them into the same public forum on the original system.<ref name=randy>Randy Bush, [http://www.fidonet.org/inet92_Randy_Bush.txt \"FidoNet: Technology, Use, Tools, and History\"], 1992</ref>\n\nIn this fashion, Rush's system implemented a store and forward public message system similar to [[Usenet]], but based on, and hosted by, the FidoNet system. The first such ''echomail'' forum was one created by the Dallas area sysops to discuss business, known as SYSOP. Another called TECH soon followed. Several public ''echos'' soon followed, including GAYNET and CLANG. These spawned hundreds of new echos, and led to the creation of the Echomail Conference List (Echolist) by Thomas Kenny in January 1987.<ref name=robbins>Frank Robbins, [http://elsmar.com/pdf_files/fidonet-info.txt \"FidoNet History Timeline\"]</ref> Echomail produced world-spanning shared forums, and its traffic volume quickly surpassed the original netmail system. By the early 1990s, echo mail was carrying over 8 MB of compressed message traffic a day, many times that when uncompressed.<ref name=randy/>\n\nEchomail did not necessarily use the same distribution pathways as normal netmail, and the distribution routing was stored in a separate setup file not unlike the original ROUTES.BBS. At the originating site a header line was added to the message indicating the origin system's name and address. After that, each system that the message traveled through added itself to a growing PATH header, as well as a SEENBY header. SEENBY prevented the message from looping around the network in the case of mis-configured routing information.<ref name=randy/>\n\nEchomail was not the only system to use the file attachment feature of netmail to implement store-and-forward capabilities. Similar concepts were used by online games and other systems as well.\n\n===Zones and points===\nThe evolution towards the net/node addressing scheme was also useful for reducing communications costs between continents, where timezone differences on either end of the connection might also come into play. For instance, the best time to forward mail in the US was at night, but that might not be the best time for European hosts to exchange. Efforts towards introducing a continental level to the addressing system started in 1986.<ref name=randy/>\n\nAt the same time, it was noted that some [[power user]]s were interested in using FidoNet protocols as a way of delivering the large quantities of echomail to their local machines where it could be read offline. These users did not want their systems to appear in the nodelist - they did not (necessarily) run a bulletin board system and were not publicly accessible.<ref name=randy/> A mechanism allowing netmail delivery to these systems without the overhead of nodelist maintenance was desirable.\n\nIn October 1986 the last major change to the FidoNet network was released, adding ''zones'' and ''points''. Zones represented major geographical areas roughly corresponding to continents. There were six zones in total, North America, South America, Europe, Oceania, Asia, and Africa. Points represented non-public nodes, which were created privately on a BBS system. Point mail was delivered to a selected host BBS as normal, but then re-packaged into a packet for the point to pick up on-demand. The complete addressing format was now <code>zone:net/node.point</code>, so a real example might be <code>Bob Smith@1:250/250.10</code>.<ref name=randy/> Points were widely used only for a short time, the introduction of [[offline reader]] systems filled this role with systems that were much easier to use. Points remain in use to this day, but are less popular than when they were introduced.\n\n===Other extensions===\nAlthough FidoNet supported file attachments from even the earliest standards, this feature tended to be rarely used and was often turned off. File attachments followed the normal mail routing through multiple systems, and could back up transfers all along the line as the files were copied. A solution was offered in the form of ''file requests'', which made file transfers driven by the ''calling'' system and used one-time point-to-point connections instead of the traditional routing. Two such standards became common, \"WaZOO\" and \"Bark\", which saw varying support among different mailers. Both worked in a similar fashion, with the mailer calling the remote system and sending a new handshake packet to request the files.<ref>Philip Becker [http://www.rxn.com/services/fts/fts-0008.txt \"An Enhanced FidoNet Technical Standard Extending FTS-0001 to include Bark requests\"], 15 October 1990</ref><ref>Vince Perriello, [http://ftsc.org/docs/fts-0006.002 \"YOOHOO and YOOHOO/2U2\"], 30 November 1991</ref>\n\nAlthough FidoNet was, by far, the best known BBS-based network, it was by no means the only one. From 1988 on, [[PCBoard]] systems were able to host similar functionality known as [[RelayNet]], while other popular networks included [[RBBSNet]] from the [[Commodore 64]] world, and [[AlterNet]]. Late in the evolution of the FidoNet system, there was a proposal to allow mail (but not forum messages) from these systems to switch into the FidoNet structure.<ref>Steve Gove, [http://ftsc.org/docs/fsc-0076.001 \"A Proposal for NetMail AreaTags\"], 3 December 1993</ref> This was not adopted, and the rapid rise of the internet made this superfluous as these networks rapidly added internet exchange, which acted as a [[lingua franca]].\n\n[[File:Fidonodes.PNG|thumb|Rapid rise, 1996 peak, and slower decline in number of Fidonodes]]\n\n===Peak===\nFidoNet started in 1984 and listed 100 nodes by the end of that year. Steady growth continued through the 1980s, but a combination of factors led to rapid growth after 1988. These included faster and less expensive modems, and rapidly declining costs of hard drives and computer systems in general. By April 1993 the FidoNet nodelist contained over 20,000 systems. At that time it was estimated that each node had, on average, about 200 active users. Of these 4 million users in total, 2 million users commonly used echomail, the shared public forums, while about 200,000 used the private netmail system.<ref name=randy/> At its peak, FidoNet listed approximately 39,000 systems.<ref name=tom/><ref group=N>The Jargon File puts it at [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/FidoNet 38,000] at its peak.</ref>\n\nThroughout its lifetime, FidoNet was beset with management problems and infighting. Much of this can be traced to the fact that the inter-net delivery cost real money, and the traffic grew more rapidly than decreases caused by improving modem speeds and downward trending long distance rates. As they increased, various methods of recouping the costs were attempted, all of which caused friction in the groups. The problems were so bad that Jennings came to refer to the system as the \"fight-o-net\".<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/fight-o-net \"fight-o-net\"], Jargon File, 4 November 1996</ref>\n\n===Decline===\n{{unreferenced|section|date=February 2018}}\nAs modems reached speeds of 28.8&nbsp;kbit/s, the overhead of the [[TCP/IP]] protocols were no longer so egregious and dial-up Internet became increasingly common. By 1995 the bulletin board market was reeling as users abandoned local BBS systems in favour of larger sites and web pages, which could be accessed worldwide for the same cost as accessing a local BBS system. This also made FidoNet less expensive to implement, because inter-net transfers could be delivered over the Internet as well, at little or no marginal cost. But this seriously diluted the entire purpose of the store-and-forward model, which had been built up specifically to address a long-distance problem that no longer existed.\n\nThe FidoNet nodelist started shrinking, especially in areas with widespread availability of internet connections. This downward trend continues, but has levelled out at approximately 2,500 nodes.<ref group=N>The exact number can be determined by examining the official nodelist. However, the format is difficult to parse and many systems deliberately appear more than once, in different sections. The 2,500 node limit is an estimate made by the current maintainer as of 2013, Janis Kracht.</ref> FidoNet remains popular in areas where Internet access is difficult to come by, or expensive.\n\n===Resurgence===\n\nThere is now (~2014) a retro movement which is resulting in a slow increase in internet connected BBS and nodes. Telnet, Rlogin, and SSH are being used between systems. This means you can telnet to many BBS worldwide as cheaply as ones next door. Also Usenet and internet mail has been added, along with long file names to many newer versions of BBS software, some being free-ware, resulting in increasing use. The deaf and blind are also able to access this better than the internet as a whole as interfaces for them deal mostly with [[ASCII]] text which exists in most BBS. They find it helps them communicate without the complications of pictures and audio in their internet mail and communication in general. Nodelists are no longer declining in all cases.\n\n==FidoNet organizational structure==\nFidoNet is governed in a hierarchical structure according to FidoNet policy, with designated coordinators at each level to manage the administration of FidoNet nodes and resolve disputes between members.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.fidonet.us/policy4.html | title = FidoNet Policy Document: Version 4.07 | date = June 9, 1989 | publisher = FidoNet | accessdate = 2010-09-30 }}</ref> Network coordinators are responsible for managing the individual nodes within their area, usually a city or similar sized area. Regional coordinators are responsible for managing the administration of the network coordinators within their region, typically the size of a state, or small country. Zone coordinators are responsible for managing the administration of all of the regions within their zone. The world is divided into six zones, the coordinators of which elect one of themselves to be the ''International Coordinator'' of FidoNet.\n\n==Technical structure==\nFidoNet was historically designed to use modem-based [[Dial-up internet access|dial-up]] ([[plain old telephone service|POTS]]) access between bulletin board systems, and much of its policy and structure reflected this.\n\nThe FidoNet system officially referred only to transfer of ''Netmail''&mdash;the individual private messages between people using bulletin boards&mdash;including the protocols and standards with which to support it. A netmail message would contain the name of the person sending, the name of the intended recipient, and the respective FidoNet addresses of each. The FidoNet system was responsible for routing the message from one system to the other (details below), with the bulletin board software on each end being responsible for ensuring that only the intended recipient could read it. Due to the hobbyist nature of the network, any privacy between sender and recipient was only the result of politeness from the owners of the FidoNet systems involved in the mail's transfer. It was common, however, for system operators to reserve the right to review the content of mail that passed through their system.\n\nNetmail allowed for the ''attachment'' of a single file to every message. This led to a series of ''piggyback'' protocols that built additional features onto FidoNet by passing information back and forth as file attachments. These included the automated distribution of files, and transmission of data for inter-BBS games.\n\nBy far the most commonly used of these piggyback protocols was ''Echomail'', public discussions similar to [[Usenet]] newsgroups in nature. Echomail was supported by a variety of software that collected up new messages from the local BBSes' public forums (the ''scanner''), compressed it using [[.arc|ARC]] or [[ZIP (file format)|ZIP]], attached the resulting archive to a Netmail message, and sent that message to a selected system. On receiving such a message, identified because it was addressed to a particular ''user'', the reverse process was used to extract the messages, and a ''tosser'' put them back into the new system's forums.\n\nEchomail was so popular that for many users, Echomail ''was'' the FidoNet. Private person-to-person Netmail was relatively rare.\n\n===Geographical structure===\nFidoNet is politically organized into a tree structure, with different parts of the tree electing their respective coordinators. The FidoNet hierarchy consists of ''zones'', ''regions'', ''networks'', ''nodes'' and ''points'' broken down more-or-less geographically.\n\nThe highest level is the zone, which is largely continent-based:\n* Zone 1 is [[North America]]\n* Zone 2 is Europe, Former [[Soviet Union]] countries, and Israel\n* Zone 3 is [[Australasia]]\n* Zone 4 is [[Latin America]] (except [[Puerto Rico]])\n* Zone 5 is Africa\n* Zone 6 was Asia, Israel and the Asian parts of Russia, (which are listed in Zone 2). On 26 July 2007 zone 6 was removed, and all remaining nodes were moved to zone 3.<ref>{{Citation | last = Shenkenberger | first = Carol | editor-last = Felten  | editor-first = Bj\u00f6rn | date =  26 July 2007 | publication-date = 30 July 2007 | title = Removal of Zone 6 | periodical = FidoNews | volume =24 | issue= 31 | page = 2 | url = http://www.fidotel.com/public/fidonews/archive/2007/FIDO2431.htm | accessdate = 2010-10-08 | quote =With sadness I have removed the last entry for Zone6 as of this writing.  All remaining members have been transitioned to Zone3 as previously determined by Z6 members at large.}}</ref>\n\nEach zone is broken down into regions, which are broken down into nets, which consist of individual nodes.  Zones 7-4095 are used for ''othernets''; groupings of nodes which use Fido-compatible software to carry their own independent message areas without being in any way controlled by FidoNet's political structure. Using un-used zone numbers would ensure that each network would have a unique set of addresses, avoiding potential routing conflicts and ambiguities for systems that belonged to more than one network.\n\n===FidoNet addresses===\nFidoNet addresses explicitly consist of a ''zone'' number, a ''network'' number (or region number), and a ''node'' number. They are written in the form <tt>Zone:Network/Node</tt>.{{sfn|Schuyler|1992|loc=Section 4.0}} The FidoNet structure also allows for semantic designation of region, host, and hub status for particular nodes, but this status is not directly indicated by the main address.\n\nFor example, consider a node located in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], [[United States]] with an assigned node number is 918, located in Zone 1 (North America), Region 19, and Network 170. The full FidoNet address for this system would be <tt>1:170/918</tt>.  The ''region'' was used for administrative purposes, and was only part of the address if the node was listed directly underneath the Regional Coordinator, rather than one of the networks that were used to divide the region further.\n\nFidoNet policy requires that each FidoNet system maintain a ''nodelist'' of every other member system. Information on each node includes the name of the system or BBS, the name of the node operator, the geographic location, the telephone number, and software capabilities. The nodelist is updated weekly, to avoid unwanted calls to nodes that had shut down, with their phone numbers possibly having been reassigned for voice use by the respective telephone company.\n\nTo accomplish regular updates, coordinators of each network maintain the list of systems in their local areas. The lists are forwarded back to the International Coordinator via automated systems on a regular basis. The International Coordinator would then compile a new nodelist, and generate the [[diff|list of changes]] (nodediff) to be distributed for node operators to apply to their existing nodelist.\n\n===Routing of FidoNet mail===\nIn a theoretical situation, a node would normally forward messages to a ''hub''. The hub, acting as a distribution point for mail, might then send the message to the Net Coordinator. From there it may be sent through a Regional Coordinator, or to some other system specifically set up for the function. Mail to other zones might be sent through a Zone Gate.\n\nFor example, a FidoNet message might follow the path:\n*1:170/918 ''(node)'' to 1:170/900 ''(hub)'' to 1:170/0 ''(net coordinator)'' to 1:19/0 ''(region coordinator)'' to 1:1/0 ''(zone coordinator)''. From there, it was distributed 'down stream' to the destination node(s).\n\nOriginally there was no specific relationship between network numbers and the regions they reside in. In some areas of FidoNet, most notably in Zone 2, the relationship between region number and network number are entwined. For example, 2:201/329 is in Net 201 which is in Region 20 while 2:2410/330 is in Net 2410 which is in Region 24. Zone 2 also relates the node number to the hub number if the network is large enough to contain any hubs. This effect may be seen in the nodelist by looking at the structure of Net 2410 where node 2:2410/330 is listed under Hub 300. This is not the case in other zones.\n\nIn Zone 1, things are much different. Zone 1 was the starting point and when Zones and Regions were formed, the existing nets were divided up regionally with no set formula. The only consideration taken was where they were located geographically in respect to the region's mapped outline. As net numbers got added, the following formula was used.\n\n<blockquote>\nRegion number \u00d7 20\n</blockquote>\nThen when some regions started running out of network numbers, the following was also used.\n<blockquote>\nRegion number \u00d7 200\n</blockquote>\nRegion 19, for instance, contains nets 380-399 and 3800-3999 in addition to those that were in Region 19 when it was formed.\n\nPart of the objective behind the formation of local nets was to implement cost reduction plans by which all messages would be sent to one or more hubs or hosts in [[data compression|compressed form]] ([[.arc|ARC]] was nominally standard, but [[PKZIP]] is universally supported); one toll call could then be made during off-peak hours to exchange entire message-filled archives with an out-of-town uplink for further redistribution.\n\nIn practice, the FidoNet structure allows for any node to connect directly to any other, and node operators would sometimes form their own toll-calling arrangements on an ad-hoc basis, allowing for a balance between collective cost saving and timely delivery. For instance, if one node operator in a network offered to make regular toll calls to a particular system elsewhere, other operators might arrange to forward all of their mail destined for the remote system, and those near it, to the local volunteer.  Operators within individual networks would sometimes have cost-sharing arrangements, but it was also common for people to volunteer to pay for regular toll calls either out of generosity, or to build their status in the community.\n\nThis ad-hoc system was particularly popular with networks that were built on top of FidoNet. Echomail, for instance, often involved relatively large file transfers due to its popularity. If official FidoNet distributors refused to transfer Echomail due to additional toll charges, other node operators would sometimes volunteer. In such cases, Echomail messages would be routed to the volunteers' systems instead.\n\nThe FidoNet system was best adapted to an environment in which local [[telephone]] service was inexpensive and long-distance calls (or intercity data transfer via [[packet-switched]] [[computer network|networks]]) costly. Therefore, it fared somewhat poorly in [[Japan]], where even local lines are expensive, or in [[France]], where tolls on local calls and competition with [[Minitel]] or other data networks limited its growth.\n\n===Points===\nAs the number of messages in Echomail grew over time, it became very difficult for users to keep up with the volume while logged into their local BBS. ''Points'' were introduced to address this, allowing technically savvy users to receive the already compressed and batched Echomail (and Netmail) and read it locally on their own machines. {{sfn|Schuyler|1992|loc=Section 5}}\n\nTo do this, the FidoNet addressing scheme was extended with the addition of a final address segment, the point number. For instance, a user on the example system above might be given point number 10, and thus could be sent mail at the address <tt>1:170/918.10</tt>.\n\nIn real-world use, points are fairly difficult to set up. The FidoNet software typically consisted of a number of small utility programs run by manually edited scripts that required some level of technical ability. Reading and editing the mail required either a \"sysop editor\" program, or a BBS program to be run locally.\n\nIn North America (Zone 1), where local calls are generally free, the benefits of the system were offset by its complexity. Points were used only briefly, and even then only to a limited degree. Dedicated [[offline mail reader]] programs such as [[Blue Wave]], Squiggy and Silver Xpress (OPX) were introduced in the mid-1990s, and quickly rendered the point system obsolete. Many of these packages supported the [[QWK (file format)|QWK]] offline mail standard.\n\nIn other parts of the world, especially Europe, this was different. In Europe, even local calls are generally metered, so there was a strong incentive to keep the duration of the calls as short as possible. Point software employs standard compression (ZIP, ARJ, etc.) and so keeps the calls down to a few minutes a day at most. In contrast to North America, pointing saw rapid and fairly widespread uptake in Europe.\n\nMany regions distribute a pointlist in parallel with the nodelist. The pointlist segments are maintained by Net- and Region Pointlist Keepers and the Zone Point List Keeper assembles them into the Zone pointlist. At the peak of FidoNet there were over 120,000 points listed in the Zone 2 pointlist. Listing points is on a voluntary basis and not every point is listed, so how many points there really were is anybody's guess. As of June 2006, there are still some 50,000 listed points. Most of them are in Russia and Ukraine.\n\n===Technical specifications===\nFidoNet contained several technical specifications for compatibility between systems.  The most basic of all is [http://ftsc.org/docs/fts-0001.016 ''FTS-0001''], with which all FidoNet systems are required to comply as a minimal requirement.  FTS-0001 defined:\n*Handshaking - the protocols used by mailer software to identify each other and exchange meta information about the session.\n*Transfer protocol ''([[XMODEM]])'' - the protocols to be used for transferring files containing FidoNet mail between systems.\n*Message format - the standard format for FidoNet messages during the time which they were exchanged between systems.\n\nOther specifications that were commonly used provided for ''echomail'', different transfer protocols and handshake methods (''e.g.: Yoohoo/Yoohoo2u2, EMSI''), file compression, nodelist format, transfer over reliable connections such as the Internet ([[Binkp]]), and other aspects.\n\n===Zone mail hour===\nSince computer bulletin boards historically used the same [[telephone line]]s for transferring mail as were used for dial-in human users of the BBS, FidoNet policy dictates that at least one designated line of each FidoNet node must be available for accepting mail from other FidoNet nodes during a particular hour of each day.{{sfn|Schuyler|1992|loc=Section 6.0}}\n\n''Zone Mail Hour'', as it was named, varies depending on the geographic location of the node, and was designated to occur during the early morning.  The exact hour varies depending on the time zone, and any node with only one telephone line is required to reject human callers. In practice, particularly in later times, most FidoNet systems tend to accept mail at any time of day when the phone line is not busy, usually during night.\n\n==FidoNet deployments==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}\nMost FidoNet deployments were designed in a modular fashion.  A typical deployment would involve several applications that would communicate through shared files and directories, and switch between each other through carefully designed [[shell script|scripts]] or [[batch file]]s.  However, [[wiktionary:monolith|monolithic]] software that encompassed all required functions in one package is available, such as D'Bridge.  Such software eliminated the need for custom batch files and is tightly integrated in operation.  The preference of deployment was that of the operator and there were both pros and cons of running in either fashion.\n\nArguably the most important piece of software on a DOS-based Fido system was the ''[[FOSSIL| FOSSIL driver]]'', which was a small device driver which provided a standard way for the Fido software to talk to the modem.{{sfn|Schuyler|1992|loc=Section 10.0}}  This driver needed to be loaded before any Fido software would work.  An efficient FOSSIL driver meant faster, more reliable connections.\n\n''Mailer software'' was responsible for transferring files and messages between systems, as well as passing control to other applications, such as the BBS software, at appropriate times.  The mailer would initially answer the phone and, if necessary, deal with incoming mail via FidoNet transfer protocols.  If the mailer answered the phone and a human caller was detected rather than other mailer software, the mailer would exit, and pass control to the BBS software, which would then initialise for interaction with the user.  When outgoing mail was waiting on the local system, the mailer software would attempt to send it from time to time by dialing and connecting to other systems who would accept and route the mail further.  Due to the costs of toll calls which often varied between peak and off-peak times, mailer software would usually allow its operator to configure the optimal times in which to attempt to send mail to other systems.\n\n''BBS software'' was used to interact with human callers to the system.  BBS software would allow dial-in users to use the system's message bases and write mail to others, locally or on other BBSes.  Mail directed to other BBSes would later be routed and sent by the mailer, usually after the user had finished using the system.  Many BBSes also allowed users to exchange files, play games, and interact with other users in a variety of ways (i.e.: node to node chat).\n\nA ''scanner/tosser'' application, such as [[FastEcho]], [[FMail]], [[TosScan]] and [[Squish (FidoNet)|Squish]], would normally be invoked when a BBS user had entered a new FidoNet message that needed to be sent, or when a mailer had received new mail to be imported into the local messages bases.  This application would be responsible for handling the packaging of incoming and outgoing mail, moving it between the local system's message bases and the mailer's inbound and outbound directories.  The scanner/tosser application would generally be responsible for basic routing information, determining which systems to forward mail to.\n\nIn later times, ''message readers'' or ''editors'' that were independent of BBS software were also developed.  Often the System Operator of a particular BBS would use a devoted message reader, rather than the BBS software itself, to read and write FidoNet and related messages. One of the most popular editors in 2008 was [[GoldED+]].  In some cases FidoNet nodes, or more often FidoNet points, had no public bulletin board attached, and existed only for the transfer of mail for the benefit of the node's operator. Most nodes in 2009 had no BBS access, but only points, if anything.\n\nThe original ''Fido BBS'' software, and some other FidoNet-supporting software from the 1980s, is no longer functional on modern systems.  This is for several reasons, including problems related to the [[Y2K bug]].  In some cases, the original authors have left the [[Bulletin board system|BBS]] or [[shareware]] community, and the software, much of which was [[closed source]], has been rendered [[abandonware]].\n\nSeveral DOS based legacy FidoNet Mailers such as [[FrontDoor]], Intermail, MainDoor and D'Bridge from the early 1990s can still be run today under Windows without a modem, by using the freeware [[NetFoss]] Telnet [[FOSSIL]] driver, and by using a Virtual Modem such as NetSerial. This allows the mailer to ''dial'' an IP address or hostname via Telnet, rather than dialing a real [[Plain old telephone service|POTS]] phone number. There are similar solutions for Linux such as MODEMU (modem emulator) which has limited success when combined with [[DOSEMU]] (DOS emulator).\nMail Tossers such as FastEcho and FMail are still used today under both Windows and Linux/DOSEMU.\n\n[[File:Qcc-0.57.1xe master queue.png|thumb|File queue in qcc, the ncurses UI for qico. The addresses are made-up.]]\nThere are several modern Windows based FidoNet Mailers available today with source code, including Argus, Radius, and Taurus<!-- (they seem to be neither [[free software]] nor [[open source software]], since, IIRC, commercial use is prohibited according to a license in the Argus source code at SF.net)-->. MainDoor is another Windows based Fidonet mailer, which also can be run using either a modem or directly over TCP/IP. Two popular [[free and open source software]] FidoNet mailers for [[Unix-like]] systems are the [[binkd]] (cross-platform, IP-only, uses the [[binkp]] protocol) and qico (supports modem communication as well as the IP protocol of ifcico and binkp).\n\nOn the ''hardware'' side, Fido systems were usually well-equipped machines, for their day, with quick CPUs, high-speed modems and [[16550]] UARTs, which were at the time an upgrade.  As a Fidonet system was usually a BBS, it needed to quickly process any new mail events before returning to its 'waiting for call' state. In addition, the BBS itself usually necessitated lots of storage space.  Finally, a FidoNet system usually had at least one dedicated phoneline.  Consequently, operating a Fidonet system often required significant financial investment, a cost usually met by the owner of the system.\n\n== FidoNet availability ==\nWhile the use of FidoNet has dropped dramatically compared with its use up to the mid-1990s, it is still used in many countries and especially [[Russia]] and former republics of the USSR.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}  Some BBSes, including those that are now available for users with [[Internet]] connections via [[telnet]], also retain their FidoNet netmail and echomail feeds.\n\nSome of FidoNet's echomail conferences are available via gateways with the Usenet news hierarchy using software like UFGate.  There are also mail gates for exchanging messages between Internet and FidoNet.  Widespread net abuse and [[e-mail spam]] on the Internet side has caused some gateways (such as the former 1:1/31 [[IEEE]] fidonet.org gateway) to become unusable or cease operation entirely.\n\n== FidoNews==\n''FidoNews'' is the [[online journal|newsletter]] of the FidoNet community.  Affectionately nicknamed ''The Snooze'', it is published weekly.  It was first published in 1984.  Throughout its history, it has been published by various people and entities, including the short-lived International FidoNet Association.\n\n==See also==\n* [[fsxNet]]\n* [[Fruity Dog]]\n* [[PODSnet]]\n* [[RelayNet]]\n* [[UUCP]]\n\n==References==\n;Notes\n{{reflist|group=N}}\n\n;Citations\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite web|url = http://www.fidonet.us/dummyguide.html|title = The Big Dummy's Guide to FidoNet|last = Schuyler|first = Michael|date=November 1992|publisher  = FidoNet|ref=harv|accessdate  = 2010-09-30}}\n* {{cite video | people = [[Jason Scott Sadofsky|Scott, Jason (director)]] | date = 2005 | title = BBS: The Documentary | url = http://www.bbsdocumentary.com/ | medium = DVD, Episode 4: \"Fidonet\" | publisher = Bovine Ignition Systems | location = Boston, MA, USA | archiveurl  = https://archive.org/details/BBS.The.Documentary | archivedate = 2008-05-10 | accessdate = 2010-08-01 | oclc = 61156153 | ref = harv}}\n{{refend}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category}}\n* {{Official website|http://www.fidonet.org/ }}\n* [http://www.fidonet.us/ Alternate FidoNet Home Page]\n* [http://www.ftsc.org/ FidoNet Technical Standards Committee Home Page]\n* [http://www.fidonews.org/ FidoNews, the weekly newsletter of the FidoNet community]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20010511145808/http://www.tlchost.net/echolist/ International Echolist Home Page]\n* [http://www.filegate.net/ IFDC FileGate Project]\n* [http://winramturbo.com/fnsp/ Fidonet Showcase Project]\n\n{{BBS}}\n{{Computer-mediated communication}}\n{{Telecommunications}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fidonet}}\n[[Category:FidoNet| ]]\n[[Category:Computer-related introductions in 1984]]\n[[Category:Computer-mediated communication]]\n[[Category:Pre\u2013World Wide Web online services]]\n[[Category:Wikipedia articles with ASCII art]]\n[[Category:BBS networks]]", "sha1": "ql8guzwdh84syfjn6c9few34btgcfap"}}, {"title": "Falsification", "ns": "0", "id": "11444", "revision": {"id": "807656940", "parentid": "583686822", "timestamp": "2017-10-29T10:12:57Z", "contributor": {"username": "Narky Blert", "id": "22041646"}, "comment": "Redlink deleted (article deleted)", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Wiktionary}}\n'''Falsification''' may refer to:\n* The act of disproving a proposition, hypothesis, or theory: see [[Falsifiability]]\n* [[Mathematical proof]]\n* [[Falsified evidence]]\n* Falsification of history, distortion of the historical record also known as [[Historical revisionism (negationism)]]\n* [[Forgery]], the act of producing something that lacks authenticity with the intent to commit fraud or deception\n* Self-falsification, e.g., the [[Liar's paradox]]\n\n{{disambiguation}}", "sha1": "e3veczmpivw4h3lnjqjm7nxk5fwzo79"}}, {"title": "Fatherland", "ns": "0", "id": "11445", "revision": {"id": "865174125", "parentid": "865174079", "timestamp": "2018-10-22T07:31:44Z", "contributor": {"ip": "39.60.244.65"}, "comment": "/* Groups that refer to their native country as a \"fatherland\" */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{mergeto | Homeland|date=February 2018}}\n\n{{other uses}}\n[[File:WWI postcards German and Austrian soldiers.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Postcard]] of an Austrian and a German soldier in the [[First World War]] with the text \"Shoulder to shoulder, hand in hand, for God, Emperor and Fatherland!\"]]\n'''Fatherland''' is the nation of one's \"fathers\", \"[[forefathers]]\" or \"[[ancestor]]s\".

Hopkinson was the only person to have made such a claim during his own lifetime, when he sent a letter and several bills to Congress for his work. These claims are documented in the Journals of the Continental Congress and George Hasting's biography of Hopkinson. Hopkinson initially wrote a letter to Congress, via the Continental Board of Admiralty, on May 25, 1780.<ref>Hastings, p. 240.</ref> In this letter, he asked for a \"Quarter Cask of the Public Wine\" as payment for designing the U.S. flag, the seal for the Admiralty Board, the seal for the Treasury Board, Continental currency, the [[Great Seal of the United States]], and other devices. However, in three subsequent bills to Congress, Hopkinson asked to be paid in cash, but he did not list his U.S. flag design. Instead, he asked to be paid for designing the \"great Naval Flag of the United States\" in the first bill; the \"Naval Flag of the United States\" in the second bill; and \"the Naval Flag of the States\" in the third, along with the other items. The flag references were generic terms for the naval ensign that Hopkinson had designed, that is, a flag of seven red stripes and six white ones. The predominance of red stripes made the naval flag more visible against the sky on a ship at sea. By contrast, Hopkinson's flag for the United States had seven white stripes, and six red ones \u2013 in reality, six red stripes laid on a white background.<ref name=\"Williams, pp. 7-9\">Williams, pp. 7\u20139.</ref> Hopkinson's sketches have not been found, but we can make these conclusions because Hopkinson incorporated different stripe arrangements in the Admiralty (naval) Seal that he designed in the Spring of 1780 and the Great Seal of the United States that he proposed at the same time.

The practice of using [[colorfulness|more saturated]] colors than the official cloth is not new. As Taylor, Knoche, and Granville wrote in 1950: \"The color of the official wool bunting [of the blue field] is a very dark blue, but printed reproductions of the flag, as well as merchandise supposed to match the flag, present the color as a deep blue much brighter than the official wool.\"<ref>Helen Taylor, Lucille Knoche, and Walter Granville, eds. (1950), ''Descriptive Color Names Dictionary''. Container Corporation of America.</ref>\n\nSometimes, [[Pantone Matching System]] (PMS) approximations to the flag colors are used. One set was given on the website of the [[U.S. Embassy, London|U.S. embassy in London]] as early as 1998; the website of the U.S. embassy in [[Stockholm]] claimed in 2001 that those had been suggested by Pantone, and that the [[United States Government Printing Office|U.S. Government Printing Office]] preferred a different set.

Eisenhower]]. Although some of them were 49-star versions, the vast majority were 50-star proposals. At least three of these designs were identical to the present design of the 50-star flag.<ref>These designs are in the [[Eisenhower Presidential Center|Eisenhower Presidential Archives]] in [[Abilene, Kansas|Abilene]], Kansas. Only a small fraction of them have ever been published.</ref> At the time, credit was given by the executive department to the [[United States Army Institute of Heraldry]] for the design.\n\nOf these proposals, one created by 17-year-old Robert G. Heft in 1958 as a school project received the most publicity. His mother was a seamstress, but refused to do any of the work for him. He originally received a B\u2013 for the project. After discussing the grade with his teacher, it was agreed (somewhat jokingly) that if the flag was accepted by Congress, the grade would be reconsidered. Heft's flag design was chosen and adopted by presidential proclamation after Alaska and before Hawaii was admitted into the Union in 1959.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.usflag.org/flagdesigner.html| title=Robert G.

Ceremonial displays of the flag, such as those in [[parade]]s or on indoor posts, often use fringe to enhance the appearance of the flag.\n\nThe first recorded use of fringe on a flag dates from 1835, and the [[United States Army|Army]] used it officially in 1895. No specific law governs the legality of fringe, but a 1925 opinion of the [[United States Attorney General|attorney general]] addresses the use of fringe (and the number of stars) \"...&nbsp;is at the discretion of the Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy&nbsp;...\" as quoted from footnote in previous volumes of [[Title 4 of the United States Code]] law books and is a source for claims that such a flag is a military ensign not civilian. However, according to the Army Institute of Heraldry, which has official custody of the flag designs and makes any change ordered, there are no implications of symbolism in the use of fringe.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/FAQ/FringeOnAmFlg.htm| title=Fringe on the American Flag| accessdate = June 27, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060911213421/http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/FAQ/FringeOnAmFlg.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = September 11, 2006}}</ref> Several federal courts have upheld this conclusion,<ref>See ''McCann v.

Some private use is year-round, but becomes widespread on civic holidays like [[Memorial Day]], [[Veterans Day (United States)|Veterans Day]], [[Presidents' Day (United States)|Presidents' Day]], [[Flag Day in the United States|Flag Day]], and on [[Independence Day (US)|Independence Day]]. On Memorial Day it is common to place small flags by war memorials and next to the graves of U.S. war veterans. Also on Memorial Day it is common to fly the flag at half staff, until noon, in remembrance of those who lost their lives fighting in U.S. wars.\n\n===Flag etiquette===\n{{Main article|United States Flag Code}}\n[[File:Vertical United States Flag.svg|thumb|left|upright|The proper stationary vertical display. The canton (blue box of stars) should always be in the upper-left corner.]]\nThe United States Flag Code outlines certain guidelines for the use, display, and disposal of the flag. For example, the flag should never be [[Flag dipping|dipped]] to any person or thing, unless it is the [[ensign]] responding to a salute from a ship of a foreign nation. This tradition may come from the [[1908 Summer Olympics]] in London, where countries were asked to dip their flag to [[Edward VII|King Edward VII]]: the American flag bearer did not. Team captain [[Martin Sheridan]] is famously quoted as saying \"this flag dips to no earthly king\", though the true provenance of this quotation is unclear.<ref>[http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/JOH/JOHv7n3/JOHv7n3i.pdf LA84 Foundation].

If the edges become tattered through wear, the flag should be repaired or replaced. When a flag is so tattered that it can no longer serve as a symbol of the United States, it should be destroyed in a dignified manner, preferably by burning. The American Legion and other organizations regularly conduct flag retirement ceremonies, often on Flag Day, June 14. (The [[Boy Scouts of America]] recommends that modern nylon or polyester flags be recycled instead of burned, due to hazardous gases being produced when such materials are burned.)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://boyslife.org/about-scouts/scouting-around/16380/consider-recycling-not-burning-a-retired-flag/ |title=Consider Recycling, not Burning, a Retired Flag |publisher=[[Boy Scouts of America]] |year=2012 |accessdate=July 6, 2012}}</ref> [[File:LDS Boy Scouts retireing an American Flag at a scout campout.JPG|thumb| 250px|LDS Boy Scouts retiring an American Flag at a scout campout]]\n\nThe [[United States Flag Code|Flag Code]] prohibits using the flag \"for any advertising purpose\" and also states that the flag \"should not be embroidered, printed, or otherwise impressed on such articles as cushions, handkerchiefs, napkins, boxes, or anything intended to be discarded after temporary use\".<ref>4 U.S.Code Sec. 8(i).</ref> Both of these codes are generally ignored, almost always without comment.\n\nSection 8, entitled '''Respect For Flag''' states in part: \"The flag should never be used as wearing apparel, bedding, or drapery\", and \"No part of the flag should ever be used as a costume or athletic uniform\". Section 3 of the Flag Code<ref>4 U.S.Code Chapter 1&nbsp;Sec. 3.</ref> defines \"the flag\" as anything \"by which the average person seeing the same without deliberation may believe the same to represent the flag of the United States of America\".\n\nAn additional part of Section 8 '''Respect For Flag''', that is frequently violated at sporting events is part (c) \"The flag should never be carried flat or horizontally, but always aloft and free.\"\n\nAlthough the Flag Code is U.S. federal law, there is no penalty for a private citizen or group failing to comply with the Flag Code and it is not widely enforced\u2014indeed, punitive enforcement would conflict with the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] right to [[freedom of speech]].<ref>''[[Texas v. Johnson]]'', 491 U.S. 397 (1989); ''[[United States v. Eichman]]'', 496 U.S. 310 (1990).</ref> Passage of the proposed [[Flag Desecration Amendment]] would overrule legal precedent that has been established.\n\n===Display on vehicles===\nWhen the flag is affixed to the right side of a vehicle of any kind (e.g.: cars, boats, planes, any physical object that moves), it should be oriented so that the canton is towards the front of the vehicle, as if the flag were streaming backwards from its hoist as the vehicle moves forward. Therefore, U.S. flag [[decal]]s on the right sides of vehicles may appear to be reversed, with the union to the observer's right instead of left as more commonly seen.\n\nThe flag has been displayed on every U.S. spacecraft designed for manned flight, including [[Project Mercury|Mercury]], [[Project Gemini|Gemini]], [[Apollo Command/Service Module]], [[Apollo Lunar Module]], and the [[Space Shuttle]]. The flag also appeared on the [[S-IC]] first stage of the [[Saturn V]] launch vehicle used for Apollo. But since Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo were launched and landed vertically and were not capable of horizontal atmospheric flight as the Space Shuttle did on its landing approach, the \"streaming\" convention was not followed and these flags were oriented with the stripes running horizontally, perpendicular to the direction of flight.\n\n===Display on uniforms===\n[[File:Apollo1-Crew 01.jpg|thumb|The crew of [[Apollo 1]] wore their flags on the right shoulder, unlike all other US astronaut flight crews]]\n[[File:Neil Armstrong pose.jpg|thumb|Flag of the United States on American astronaut [[Neil Armstrong]]'s space suit]]\n[[File:Buzz salutes the U.S. Flag.jpg|thumb|upright|Astronaut [[Buzz Aldrin]] salutes the [[Lunar Flag Assembly|United States flag]] on the surface of the [[moon]] during the [[Apollo 11]] mission.]]\nOn some U.S. military uniforms, flag patches are worn on the right shoulder, following the vehicle convention with the union toward the front. This rule dates back to the Army's early history, when both mounted cavalry and infantry units would designate a standard bearer, who carried the Colors into battle. As he charged, his forward motion caused the flag to stream back. Since the Stars and Stripes are mounted with the canton closest to the pole, that section stayed to the right, while the stripes flew to the left.<ref>[http://usmilitary.about.com/od/theorderlyroom/f/faqflag.htm About.com].

The 48-star flag first appeared on the General [[Casimir Pulaski]] issue of 1931, though in a [[:File:General Pulaski 1931 Issue-2c.jpg|small monochrome depiction]]. The first U.S. postage stamp to feature the flag as the sole subject was issued July 4, 1957, [[Scott catalog]] number 1094.<ref>Scott's Specialized Catalogue of United States Postage Stamps.</ref> Since that time the flag has frequently appeared on U.S. stamps.\n\n===Display in museums===\nIn 1907 Eben Appleton, New York stockbroker and grandson of Lieutenant Colonel [[George Armistead]] (the commander of Fort McHenry during the 1814 bombardment) loaned the [[Star Spangled Banner Flag]] to the [[Smithsonian Institution]], and in 1912 he converted the loan to a gift. Appleton donated the flag with the wish that it would always be on view to the public. In 1994, the [[National Museum of American History]] determined that the [[Star Spangled Banner Flag]] required further conservation treatment to remain on public display. In 1998 teams of museum conservators, curators, and other specialists helped move the flag from its home in the Museum's Flag Hall into a new conservation laboratory. Following the reopening of the [[National Museum of American History]] on November 21, 2008, the flag is now on display in a special exhibition, \"The Star-Spangled Banner: The Flag That Inspired the National Anthem,\" where it rests at a 10 degree angle in dim light for conservation purposes.<ref name=\"Smithsonian\">{{cite web|url=http://amhistory.si.edu/starspangledbanner/ |title=The Star-Spangled Banner Online Exhibition |publisher=National Museum of American History, Smithsonian Institution |accessdate=April 4, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Places of continuous display===\nBy presidential proclamation, acts of Congress, and custom, U.S. flags are displayed continuously at certain locations.\n* Replicas of the [[Star Spangled Banner Flag]] (15 stars, 15 stripes) are flown at two sites in [[Baltimore]], Maryland: [[Fort McHenry|Fort McHenry National Monument and Historic Shrine]]<ref>[[s:Proclamation 2795|Presidential Proclamation No. 2795]], July 2, 1948 [https://archive.is/20120707025814/http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?view=image;size=100;id=mdp.39015073075999;page=root;seq=224;num=212  Code of Federal Regulations of the United States, Title 3 Compilation (1943\u20131948)], HathiTrust, Google Books/University of Michigan scan, pages 212\u2013213.</ref> and [[Flag House Square]].<ref>Public Law 83-319, approved March 26, 1954.</ref>\n* [[Marine Corps War Memorial]] ([[Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima]]), [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington, Virginia]].<ref>Presidential Proclamation No. 3418, June 12, 1961.</ref>\n* The [[Lexington Battle Green|Battle Green]] in [[Lexington, Massachusetts]], site of the first shots fired in the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolution]]<ref>Public Law 89-335, approved November 8, 1965.</ref>\n* The [[White House]], Washington, D.C.<ref>Presidential Proclamation No. 4000, September 4, 1970.</ref>\n* Fifty U.S. flags are displayed continuously at the [[Washington Monument]], Washington, D.C.<ref>Presidential Proclamation No. 4064, July 6, 1971, effective July 4, 1971.</ref>\n[[File:US Marine Corps War Memorial (Iwo Jima Monument) near Washington DC.jpg|thumb|[[Marine Corps War Memorial]], Arlington, Virginia]]\n* At [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] Ports of Entry that are continuously open.<ref>Presidential Proclamation No. 4131, May 5, 1972.</ref>\n* A Civil War era flag (for the year 1863) flies above [[Pennsylvania Hall (Gettysburg)|Pennsylvania Hall]] (Old Dorm) at [[Gettysburg College]].<ref>[http://www.gettysburg.edu/news_events/news_detail.dot?inode=2746067&pageTitle=34-star+flag+flies+over+Gettysburg+College+without+Congressional+approval Gettysburg College \u2013 News Detail] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100617041330/http://www.gettysburg.edu/news_events/news_detail.dot?inode=2746067&pageTitle=34-star+flag+flies+over+Gettysburg+College+without+Congressional+approval |date=June 17, 2010 }}.

Nationwide, this action is proclaimed by the president; statewide or territory-wide, the proclamation is made by the governor. In addition, there is no prohibition against municipal governments, private businesses or citizens flying the flag at half-staff as a local sign of respect and mourning. However, many flag enthusiasts feel this type of practice has somewhat diminished the meaning of the original intent of lowering the flag to honor those who held high positions in federal or state offices. President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] issued the first proclamation on March 1, 1954, standardizing the dates and time periods for flying the flag at half-staff from all federal buildings, grounds, and naval vessels; other congressional resolutions and presidential proclamations ensued. However, they are only guidelines to all other entities: typically followed at state and local government facilities, and encouraged of private businesses and citizens.\n\nTo properly fly the flag at half-staff, one should first briefly hoist it top of the staff, then lower it to the half-staff position, halfway between the top and bottom of the staff. Similarly, when the flag is to be lowered from half-staff, it should be first briefly hoisted to the top of the staff.<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/4/7(f).html US Code, Title 4, Chapter 1, \u00a77].</ref>\n\nFederal statutes provide that the flag should be flown at half-staff on the following dates:\n* May 15: [[Peace Officers Memorial Day]] (unless it is the third Saturday in May, [[Armed Forces Day]], then full-staff)<ref>[http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=browse_usc&docid=Cite:+36USC136 36 U.S.C.

To properly fold the flag:\n\n# Begin by holding it waist-high with another person so that its surface is parallel to the ground.\n# Fold the lower half of the stripe section lengthwise over the field of stars, holding the bottom and top edges securely.\n# Fold the flag again lengthwise with the blue field on the outside.\n# Make a rectangular fold then a triangular fold by bringing the striped corner of the folded edge to meet the open top edge of the flag, starting the fold from the left side over to the right.\n# Turn the outer end point inward, parallel to the open edge, to form a second triangle.\n# The triangular folding is continued until the entire length of the flag is folded in this manner (usually thirteen triangular folds, as shown at right). On the final fold, any remnant that does not neatly fold into a triangle (or in the case of exactly even folds, the last triangle) is tucked into the previous fold.\n# When the flag is completely folded, only a triangular blue field of stars should be visible.\n\nThere is also no specific meaning for each fold of the flag. However, there are scripts read by non-government organizations and also by the Air Force that are used during the flag folding ceremony. These scripts range from historical timelines of the flag to religious themes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mortuary.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-100317-022.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130217183234/http://www.mortuary.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-100317-022.pdf |archivedate=February 17, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legion.org/flag/folding |title=Flag-Folding Procedures &#124; The American Legion |publisher=Legion.org |date= |accessdate=September 8, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Use in funerals==\n[[File:Flag funeral.jpg|thumb|A flag prepared for presentation to the next of kin]]\nTraditionally, the flag of the United States plays a role in [[military funeral]]s,<ref name=\"ANC\">{{cite web|url=http://www.arlingtoncemetery.org/ceremonies/military_funerals.html |title=Sequence of Events for an Army Honors Funeral At Arlington National Cemetery |publisher=[[Arlington National Cemetery]] |accessdate=February 6, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125050451/http://arlingtoncemetery.org/ceremonies/military_funerals.html |archivedate=January 25, 2009 }}</ref> and occasionally in funerals of other civil servants (such as law enforcement officers, fire fighters, and U.S. presidents).

The Federated States of Micronesia is spread across part of the [[Caroline Islands]] in the wider region of [[Micronesia]], which consists of thousands of small islands divided among several countries. The term ''Micronesia'' may refer to the Federated States or to the region as a whole.\n\nThe FSM was formerly a part of the [[Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands]] (TTPI), a [[United Nations]] Trust Territory under U.S. administration, but it formed its own constitutional government on May 10, 1979, becoming a sovereign state after independence was attained on November 3, 1986 under a [[Compact of Free Association]] with the United States. Other neighboring island entities, and also former members of the TTPI, formulated their own constitutional governments and became the [[Marshall Islands|Republic of the Marshall Islands]] (RMI) and the [[Palau|Republic of Palau]] (ROP). The FSM has a seat in the United Nations.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of the Federated States of Micronesia}}\n{{Quote box \n|title=Historical affiliations\n|quote={{flag|Spain|1785}} 1565\u20131899<br />{{flagcountry|German Empire}} 1899\u20131918<br />{{flagcountry|Empire of Japan}} 1919\u20131947<br />{{flag|United States|1960}} 1947\u20131994<br />{{flag|Micronesia}} 1994\u2013present\n|align=left \n|width=22em \n|fontsize=90% \n|bgcolor=#B0C4DE\n}}\n\nThe ancestors of the Micronesians settled over four thousand years ago. A decentralized chieftain-based system eventually evolved into a more centralized economic and religious culture centered on [[Yap Island]].\n\n[[Nan Madol]], consisting of a series of small [[artificial island]]s linked by a network of canals, is often called the Venice of the Pacific. It is located on the eastern periphery of the island of Pohnpei and used to be the ceremonial and political seat of the Saudeleur dynasty that united Pohnpei's estimated 25,000 people from about [[Anno Domini|AD]] 500 until 1500, when the centralized system collapsed.\n\nEuropean explorers\u2014first the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] in search of the [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]] ([[Indonesia]]) and then the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]]\u2014reached the [[Caroline Islands|Carolines]] in the sixteenth century. The Spanish incorporated the archipelago to the [[Spanish East Indies]] through the capital, [[Manila]], and in the 19th century established a number of outposts and missions. In 1887, they founded the town of ''Santiago de la Ascension'' in what today is [[Kolonia]] on the island of Pohnpei.\n\nFollowing defeat in the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], the Spanish sold the archipelago to [[German Empire|Germany]] in 1899 under the [[German\u2013Spanish Treaty (1899)|German\u2013Spanish Treaty of 1899]]. Germany incorporated it into [[German New Guinea]].\n\nDuring [[World War I]], it was captured by [[Empire of Japan|Japan]]. Following the war, the [[League of Nations]] awarded a [[League of Nations Mandate|mandate]] for Japan to administer the islands as part of the [[Nanyo (Japanese mandated territory)|South Pacific Mandate]].\n\nDuring [[World War II]], a significant portion of the Japanese fleet was based in [[Truk Lagoon]]. In February 1944, [[Operation Hailstone]], one of the most important naval battles of the war, took place at Truk, in which many Japanese support vessels and aircraft were destroyed.\n\nFollowing World War II, it was administered by the [[United States]] under [[United Nations]] auspices in 1947 as part of the [[Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands]] pursuant to [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 21|Security Council Resolution 21]].\n\nOn May 10, 1979, four of the Trust Territory districts ratified a new constitution to become the Federated States of Micronesia. [[Palau]], the [[Marshall Islands]], and the [[Northern Mariana Islands]] chose not to participate. The FSM signed a [[Compact of Free Association]] with the United States, which entered into force on November 3, 1986, marking Micronesia's emergence from trusteeship to independence. Independence was formally concluded under international law in 1990, when the United Nations officially ended the Trusteeship status pursuant to [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 683|Security Council Resolution 683]]. The Compact was renewed in 2004.\n\n==Politics==\n{{main|Politics of the Federated States of Micronesia}}\n\nThe Federated States of Micronesia is governed by the [[Constitution of the Federated States of Micronesia|1979 constitution]], which guarantees fundamental human rights and establishes a separation of governmental powers. The unicameral Congress has fourteen members elected by popular vote. Four senators\u2014one from each state\u2014serve four-year terms; the remaining ten senators represent single-member districts based on population, and serve two-year terms. The President and Vice President are elected by Congress from among the four state-based senators to serve four-year terms in the executive branch. Their congressional seats are then filled by special elections.\n\nThe president and vice president are supported by an appointed cabinet. There are no formal political parties.\n\n===Defense and foreign affairs===\n{{main|Compact of Free Association}}\n\nIn international politics, the Federated States of Micronesia has often voted with the United States with respect to [[United Nations General Assembly]] resolutions.<ref>[https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/82642.pdf General Assembly - Overall Votes - Comparison with U.S. vote] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170626185544/https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/82642.pdf |date=June 26, 2017 }} lists Micronesia as in the country with the fourth high coincidence of votes.

The Division of Maritime Surveillance operates a paramilitary Maritime Wing and a small [[Water police|Maritime Police]] Unit.

A commission of [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]] under [[Pope Leo XIII]] arbitrated a dispute for the [[Caroline Islands]] and others extending from the [[Equator]] to 11\u00b0N [[Latitude]] and from 133\u00b0E to 164\u00b0E [[Longitude]].  [[Germany]] and [[Spain]] on 17 December 1885 agreed in a [[treaty]] that they were a part of the [[Spanish East Indies]].  In 1899, Spain sold \"las  Carolinas\" to Germany.   Kapingamarangi is far south of the Carolines and the people are racially and culturally [[Polynesians|Polynesian]], not [[Micronesian people|Micronesian]] or [[Carolinian people|Carolinian]].  In 1948, Emilio Pastor Santos of the [[Spanish National Research Council]] found that the charts and maps up to 1899 had shown that Kapingamarangi and a few other islands had never been considered part of the Carolines, were not included in the description of the territory transferred to Germany and were never [[Cession|ceded]] by Spain; therefore, Spain retained [[sovereignty]].  In 1949, the Cabinet of Diplomatic Information of the Spanish [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation (Spain)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] issued the following declaration:\n<blockquote>\"... The Ministry recognises that it is a certain fact and historic truth due to Article 3 of the Treaty of July 1, 1899, that Spain reserved a series of rights in Micronesia and for another thing, the specifications of the territories which Spain ceded in 1899 leaves apart certain groups of islands in the same zone.\"</blockquote>\nSuccessive Spanish governments have not abandoned Spain's sovereignty, or insisted on enforcing it, or recognized the sovereignty of the Federated States of Micronesia over Kapingamarangi.<ref>Pastor y Santos, Emilio ''Territorios de Soberan\u00eda espa\u00f1ola en Ocean\u00eda'', Instituto de Estudios Africanos, CSIC, Madrid, 1950</ref><ref>Weaver, Zay ''Territories under Spanish Sovereignty in Oceania'' (partial translation of Pastor y Santos, Emilio ''Territorios de Soberan\u00eda espa\u00f1ola en Ocean\u00eda''), Palau Museum, Koror, 1967</ref> The Federated States of Micronesia claims sovereignty and has [[de facto]] control of the island.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Koloniasokehs.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|A view of Kolonia Town from Sokehs Ridge in [[Pohnpei]].]]\n{{main|Geography of the Federated States of Micronesia}}\n\nThe Federated States of Micronesia consists of 607 [[island]]s extending {{convert|2900|km|0|abbr=on}} across the [[archipelago]] of the [[Caroline Islands]] east of the [[Philippines]].

Frederick William was a staunch pillar of the [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] faith, associated with the rising commercial class. He saw the importance of trade and promoted it vigorously. His shrewd domestic reforms gave Prussia a strong position in the [[Treaty of Westphalia|post-Westphalian]] political order of north-central Europe, setting Prussia up for elevation from duchy to [[Kingdom of Prussia|kingdom]], achieved under his [[Frederick I of Prussia|son and successor]].\n\n==Biography==\nElector Frederick William was born in [[Berlin]] to [[George William, Elector of Brandenburg]], and [[Elizabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate (1597-1660)|Elisabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate]]. His inheritance consisted of the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]], the [[Duchy of Cleves]], the [[County of Mark]], and the [[Duchy of Prussia]].\n\n==Foreign diplomacy==\nDuring the [[Thirty Years' War]], George William strove to maintain, with a minimal army, a delicate balance between the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] and Catholic forces fighting throughout the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Out of these unpromising beginnings Frederick William managed to rebuild his war-ravaged territories. In contrast to the religious disputes that disrupted the internal affairs of other European states, Brandenburg-Prussia benefited from the policy of religious tolerance adopted by Frederick William. With the help of French [[subsidy|subsidies]], he built up an army to defend the country. In the [[Second Northern War]], he was forced to accept Swedish vassalage for the [[Duchy of Prussia]] according to the terms of the [[Treaty of K\u00f6nigsberg (1656)|Treaty of K\u00f6nigsberg]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Press|first=Volker|title=Kriege und Krisen.

After marching 250 kilometres in 15 days back to Brandenburg, he caught the Swedes by surprise and managed to defeat them on the field at the [[Battle of Fehrbellin]], destroying the myth of Swedish military invincibility.  He later destroyed another Swedish army that invaded the Duchy of Prussia during the [[Great Sleigh Drive]] in 1678.  He is noted for his use of broad directives and delegation of decision-making to his commanders, which would later become the basis for the German doctrine of [[Auftragstaktik]], and he is noted for using rapid mobility to defeat his foes.<ref>Citino, Robert.

He was an advocate of [[mercantilism]], monopolies, subsidies, tariffs, and [[internal improvements]]. Following Louis XIV's revocation of the [[Edict of Nantes]], Frederick William encouraged skilled French and [[Walloons|Walloon]] [[Huguenot]]s to emigrate to [[Brandenburg-Prussia]] with the [[Edict of Potsdam]], bolstering the country's technical and industrial base. On Blumenthal's advice he agreed to exempt the nobility from taxes and in return they agreed to dissolve the [[The Estates|Estates-General]]. He also simplified travel in Brandenburg and the Duchy of Prussia by connecting riverways with canals, a system that was expanded by later [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] architects, such as [[Georg Steenke]]; the system is still in use today.\n\n==Marriages==\n[[File:Mijtens - Mariage de l'\u00c9lecteur de Brandebourg.jpg|thumb|Painting of his 1646 wedding ceremony by [[Johannes Mytens]].]]\n[[File:Anselmus-van-Hulle-Hommes-illustres MG 0438.tif|thumb|Portrait engraving after a painting by [[Anselm van Hulle]].]]\n\nOn 7 December 1646 in [[The Hague]], Frederick William entered into a marriage, proposed by Blumenthal as a partial solution to the J\u00fclich-Berg question, with [[Luise Henriette of Nassau]] (1627\u20131667), daughter of [[Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange|Frederick Henry of Orange-Nassau]] and [[Amalia von Solms|Amalia of Solms-Braunfels]] and his 1st cousin once removed through [[William the Silent]].

The '''double horn in F/B{{music|flat}}''' (technically a variety of [[German horn]]) is the horn most often used by players in professional orchestras and bands. A musician who plays a French horn is known as a [[list of horn players|horn player]] or hornist.\n\nPitch is controlled through the combination of the following factors: speed of air through the instrument (controlled by the player's lungs and [[thoracic diaphragm]]); diameter and tension of lip aperture (by the player's lip muscles\u2014the [[embouchure]]) in the mouthpiece; plus, in a modern French horn, the operation of [[Brass instrument valve|valves]] by the left hand, which route the air into extra sections of tubing. Most horns have lever-operated [[rotary valve]]s, but some, especially older horns, use [[piston valve]]s (similar to a [[trumpet]]'s) and the [[Vienna horn]] uses double-piston valves, or [[Brass instrument valve#Double-piston valve|pumpenvalves]]. The backward-facing orientation of the bell relates to the perceived desirability to create a subdued sound in concert situations, in contrast to the more piercing quality of the trumpet. A horn without valves is known as a natural horn, changing pitch along the natural [[harmonics]] of the instrument (similar to a [[bugle (instrument)|bugle]]). Pitch may also be controlled by the position of the hand in the bell, in effect reducing the bell's diameter. The pitch of any note can easily be raised or lowered by adjusting the hand position in the bell.<ref name=\"Whitener\">{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/19128016 |title=A complete guide to brass : instruments and pedagogy |last=Whitener |first=Scott and Cathy L. |publisher=Schirmer Books |year=1990 |isbn=978-0028728612 |location=New York |pages=40, 44 |oclc=19128016}}</ref>\n\nThree valves control the flow of air in the ''single horn'', which is tuned to F or less commonly B{{music|flat}}. The more common ''double horn'' has a fourth, trigger valve, usually operated by the thumb, which routes the air to one set of tubing tuned to F or another tuned to B{{music|flat}} which expands the horn range to over four [[octaves]] and blends with flutes or [[clarinet]]s in a [[woodwind ensemble]]. Triple horns with five valves are also made, usually tuned in F, B{{music|flat}}, and a [[descant]] E{{music|flat}} or F. There are also double horns with five valves tuned in B{{music|flat}}, descant E{{music|flat}} or F, and a stopping valve, which greatly simplifies the complicated and difficult hand-stopping technique<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://poperepair.com/alexander-107-descant-w-stopping-valve-7800 |title=Alexander 107 Descant w/Stopping Valve - $7800 |last=Pope |first=Ken |website=Pope Instrument Repair |language=en |access-date=2018-02-22}}</ref>, though these are rarer. Also common are ''descant'' doubles, which typically provide B{{music|flat}} and alto F branches.\n\nA crucial element in playing the horn deals with the mouthpiece. Most of the time, the mouthpiece is placed in the exact center of the lips, but, because of differences in the formation of the lips and teeth of different players, some tend to play with the mouthpiece slightly off center.<ref name=\"AOFHP\">{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/5587694 |title=The art of French horn playing : a treatise on the problems and techniques of French Horn playing \u2026 |last=Farkas |first=Philip |date=1956 |publisher=Summy-Birchard |year=1956 |isbn=978-0874870213 |location=Evanston, Il. |pages=6, 21, 65 |oclc=5587694}}</ref> Although the exact side-to-side placement of the mouthpiece varies for most horn players, the up-and-down placement of the mouthpiece is generally two-thirds on the upper lip and one-third on the lower lip.<ref name=\"AOFHP\" /> When playing higher notes, the majority of players exert a small degree of additional pressure on the lips using the mouthpiece. However, this is undesirable from the perspective of both endurance and tone: excessive mouthpiece pressure makes the horn sound forced and harsh, and decreases player's stamina due to the resulting constricted flow of blood to the lips and lip muscles.<ref name=\"AOFHP\" />\n\n==Name==\nThe name \"French horn\" is found only in English, first coming into use in the late 17th century.  At that time, French makers were preeminent in the manufacture of hunting horns, and were credited with creating the now-familiar, circular \"hoop\" shape of the instrument. As a result, these instruments were often called, even in English, by their French names: ''trompe de chasse'' or ''cor de chasse'' (the clear modern distinction between ''trompes'', trumpets, and ''cors'', horns, did not exist at that time). German makers first devised ''crooks'' to make such horns playable in different keys\u2014so musicians came to use \"French\" and \"German\" to distinguish the simple hunting horn from the newer horn with crooks, which in England was also called by the Italian name ''corno cromatico'' (chromatic horn).<ref name=\"Beakes\">{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=zpOAnQEACAAJ |title=The Horn Parts in Handel's Operas and Oratorios and the Horn Players who Performed in These Works |last=Beakes |first=Jennifer |date=2007 |publisher=City University of New York |pages=50, 116\u201318, 176, 223\u201325, 439\u201340, 444\u201345 |language=en}}</ref> More recently, \"French horn\" is often used colloquially, though the adjective has normally been avoided when referring to the European orchestral horn, ever since the German horn began replacing the French-style instrument in British orchestras around 1930.<ref name=\"Del Mar\">{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/10561390 |title=Anatomy of the orchestra |last=Del Mar |first= Norman |date=1983 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0520045002 |edition=2nd print., with revisions |location=Berkeley |pages=215 |oclc=10561390}}</ref> The [[International Horn Society]] has recommended since 1971 that the instrument be simply called the ''horn''.<ref name=\"Meek1\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.hornsociety.org/home/ihs-news/26-people/honorary/61-harold-meek-1914-1998 |title=Harold Meek (1914\u20131998) |last=Meek |first=Harold |website=International Horn Society |access-date=2018-09-04 |quote=Harold Meek is described by everyone as a gentleman, a perfectionist, and one who loved the horn.

In this sense, \"French horn\" refers to a narrow-bore instrument ({{cvt|10.8|-|11.0|mm|in|disp=sqbr}}) with three P\u00e9rinet (piston) valves. It retains the narrow bell-throat and mouthpipe crooks of the orchestral hand horn of the late 18th century, and most often has an \"ascending\" third valve. This is a whole-tone valve arranged so that with the valve in the \"up\" position the valve loop is engaged, but when the valve is pressed the loop is cut out, raising the pitch by a whole tone.<ref name=\"Baines\">{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/3795926 |title=Brass instruments : their history and development |last=Baines |first=Anthony |date=1976 |publisher=Scribner |isbn=978-0684152295 |location=New York |pages=221\u201323 |oclc=3795926}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{main|Horn (instrument)}}\n[[File:French-horn.png|left|thumb|250px|Horn with three [[piston valve|Perinet valves]]]]\n[[File:How to shout and blow Horns Fac simile of a Miniature in the Manuscript of Phoebus Fifteenth Century.png|thumb|right|\"How to shout and blow horns.\"\u2014Facsimile of a miniature in a manuscript of the hunting manual of [[Gaston III of Foix-B\u00e9arn|Gaston Phoebus]] (15th century)]]\n\nAs the name indicates, humans originally used to blow on the actual [[Horn (anatomy)|horn]]s of animals before starting to emulate them in metal. This original usage survives in the [[shofar]], a ram's horn, which plays an important role in [[Judaism|Jewish religious rituals]].\n\nEarly metal horns were less complex than modern horns, consisting of brass tubes with a slightly flared opening (the bell) wound around a few times. These early \"hunting\" horns were originally played on a hunt, often while mounted, and the sound they produced was called a recheat. Change of pitch was controlled entirely by the lips (the horn not being equipped with valves until the 19th century). Without valves, only the notes within the [[harmonic series (music)|harmonic series]] are available.  By combining a long length with a narrow bore, the French horn's design allows the player to easily reach the higher overtones which differ by whole tones, thus making it capable of playing melodies before valves were invented.<ref name=\"AOFHP\" />\n\nEarly horns were commonly pitched in B{{music|flat}} alto, A, A{{music|flat}}, G, F, E, E{{music|flat}}, D, C, and B{{music|flat}} basso. Since the only notes available were those on the harmonic series of one of those pitches, they had no ability to play in different keys. The remedy for this limitation was the use of [[Crook (music)|crooks]], i.e., sections of tubing of differing length that, when inserted, altered the length of the instrument, and thus its pitch.\n\nIn the mid-18th century, horn players began to insert the right hand into the bell to change the length of the instrument, adjusting the tuning up to the distance between two adjacent harmonics depending on how much of the opening was covered.\n\nIn 1818 the German makers [[Heinrich St\u00f6lzel]] and Friedrich Bl\u00fcmel patented the first valved horn, using rotary valves. Piston valves were introduced in France about 1839 by Fran\u00e7ois P\u00e9rinet.<ref name=\"Meek3\">{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/35636932 |title=Horn and conductor : reminiscences of a practitioner with a few words of advice |last=Meek |first=Harold L. |date=1997 |publisher=University of Rochester Press |isbn=978-1878822833 |location=Rochester, NY |pages=33 |oclc=35636932}}</ref> Valves were initially intended to overcome problems associated with changing crooks during a performance. Valves' unreliability, musical taste, and players' distrust, among other reasons, slowed their adoption into mainstream. Many traditional conservatories and players refused to use them at first, claiming that the valveless horn, or ''natural horn'', was a better instrument. Some musicians who specialize in period instruments use a natural horn to play in original performance styles, to try to recapture the sound of an older piece's original performances.<ref>See, e.g., the performance of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s ''[[Mass in B Minor]]'' as performed by the [[Proms]] of London in the movement from 45:40 onward in {{cite web\n|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7F7TVM8m95Y\n|title = Mass in B Minor\n|magazine = You Tube\n|date = 2012\n|accessdate = 2013-11-29\n}}</ref>\n\nThe use of [[brass instrument valve|valves]], however, opened up a great deal more flexibility in playing in different keys; in effect, the horn became an entirely different instrument, fully chromatic for the first time. Valves were originally used primarily as a means to play in different keys without crooks, not for harmonic playing. That is reflected in compositions for horns, which only began to include chromatic passages in the late 19th century.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018|Speculation=The extremely high horn playing from the baroque and early classical periods would allow the horn to play almost completely chromatically due to the tiny differences in harmonics. This may have caused the name to develop as nobody was to know then that true chromaticism would happen in the next century. Examples include anything in a high register from that period, e.g. the horn solo from Bach's B-Minor Mass}}<!--If this is true, then what was the \"corno chromatico\" of the late 18th century, and why was it so called?-->  When valves were invented, generally, the French made smaller horns with piston valves and the Germans made larger horns with rotary valves.{{Clarify|reason=German brass players had (and many still have) a preference towards rotary valves. This is commonly seen as a holdover today as a huge amount of German and Austrian orchestras use rotary trumpets, while the majority of the rest of the world use piston trumpets.

This allows for simplicity of use and a much lighter weight. They are usually in the keys of F or B{{music|flat}}, although many F horns have longer slides to tune them to E{{music|flat}}, and almost all B{{music|flat}} horns have a valve to put them in the key of A. The problem with single horns is the inevitable choice between accuracy or tone \u2013 while the F horn has the \"typical\" horn sound, above third-space C accuracy is a concern for the majority of players because, by its nature, one plays high in the horn's harmonic series where the overtones are closer together. This led to the development of the B{{music|flat}} horn, which, although easier to play accurately, has a less desirable sound in the mid and especially the low register where it is not able to play all of the notes.  The solution has been the development of the double horn, which combines the two into one horn with a single lead pipe and bell.  Both main types of single horns are still used today as student models because they are cheaper and lighter than double horns.  In addition, the single B{{music|flat}} horns are sometimes used in solo and chamber performances and the single F survives orchestrally as the Vienna horn. Additionally, single F alto and B{{music|flat}} alto descants are used in the performance of some baroque horn concertos and F, B{{music|flat}} and F alto singles are occasionally used by [[jazz]] performers.\n\n[[Dennis Brain]]'s benchmark recordings of the Mozart Horn Concerti were made on a single B{{music|flat}} instrument by [[Gebr. Alexander]], now on display at the [[Royal Academy of Music]] in London.\n\n===Double horn===\n[[File:French horn detail.jpg|frame|right|The [[rotary valve|valves]] of a [[Conn-Selmer|Conn]] 6D double horn. The three lever keys (above the large valves) can be depressed toward the large outer tube. The thumb key (''near the left-most valve'') moves inward toward the three finger keys.]]\n[[File:French Horn back.svg|thumb|right|Scheme of a double horn (''view from underneath'')\n{{ordered list\n| [[Mouthpiece (brass)|Mouthpiece]]\n| [[Leadpipe]], where the mouthpiece is placed\n| Adjustable handrest\n| [[Water key]] (also called a spit valve)\n| Fourth valve to change between F and B{{music|flat}} pitches\n| Valve levers, operated with the left hand\n| [[Brass instrument valve#Rotary valve|Rotary valves]]\n| [[Slide (wind instrument)|Slides]], for tuning each valve\n| Long tubing for F pitch with slide\n| General slide\n| Short tubing for B{{music|flat}} pitch with slide\n| Bellpipe\n| [[Bell (wind instrument)|Bell]]; the right hand is cupped inside this\n}}]]\nDespite the introduction of valves, the single F horn proved difficult for use in the highest range, where the partials grew closer and closer, making accuracy a great challenge. An early solution was simply to use a horn of higher pitch\u2014usually B{{music|flat}}. The use of the F versus the B{{music|flat}} horn was extensively debated among horn players of the late 19th century, until the German horn maker Ed. Kruspe (namesake of [[Ed. Kruspe|his family's brass instrument firm]]) produced a prototype of the \"double horn\" in 1897.\n\nThe double horn also combines two instruments into a single frame: the original horn in F, and a second, higher horn keyed in B{{music|flat}}. By using a fourth valve (usually operated by the thumb), the horn player can quickly switch from the deep, warm tones of the F horn to the higher, brighter tones of the B{{music|flat}} horn, or vice versa, as the horn player may choose to have the horn set into B{{music|flat}} by default by making a simple adjustment to the valves. The two sets of tones are commonly called \"sides\" of the horn. Using the fourth valve not only changes the basic length (and thus the harmonic series and pitch) of the instrument, it also causes the three main valves to use proportionate slide lengths.<ref>Backus, John, ''The Acoustical Foundations of Music'', 2nd ed. (New York: W. W. Norton, 1977),{{Page needed|date=June 2015}} {{ISBN|0-393-09096-5}}.</ref>\n\nIn the US, the two most common styles (\"wraps\") of double horns are named Kruspe and Geyer/Knopf, after the first instrument makers who developed and standardized them. The Kruspe wrap locates the B{{music|flat}} change valve above the first valve, near the thumb. The Geyer wrap has the change valve behind the third valve, near the little finger (although the valve's trigger is still played with the thumb). In effect, the air flows in a completely different direction on the other model. Kruspe wrap horns tend to be larger in the bell throat than the Geyer wrap horns. Typically, Kruspe models are constructed from [[nickel silver]] (also called German silver, an alloy of copper, nickel and zinc, containing no actual silver) while Geyer horns tend to be of yellow brass. Both models have their own strengths and weaknesses, and while the choice of instrument is very personal, an orchestral horn section is usually found to have either one or the other, owing to the differences in tone color, response, and projection of the two different styles.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nIn Europe the most popular horns are arguably those made by Gebr. Alexander, of Mainz (particularly the Alexander 103), and those made by [[Paxman Musical Instruments|Paxman]] in London. In Germany and the [[Benelux]] countries, the Alex 103 is extremely popular. These horns do not fit strictly into the Kruspe or Knopf camps, but have features of both. Alexander prefers the traditional medium bell size, which they have produced for many years, whereas Paxman do offer their models in a range of bell throat sizes. In the United States, the [[Conn-Selmer|Conn]] 8D, a mass-produced instrument based on the Kruspe design, has been extremely popular in many areas (New York, Los Angeles, Cleveland, Philadelphia). Since roughly the early 1990s, however, for reasons ranging from changing tastes to a general dislike of Conn's newer 8Ds, orchestras have been moving away from the popular Conn 8D. Geyer model horns (by Carl Geyer, Karl Hill, Keith Berg, Steve Lewis, Jerry Lechniuk, [[Daniel Rauch|Dan Rauch]], and Ricco-Kuhn) are used in other areas (San Francisco, Chicago, Pittsburgh, Boston, Houston). The CF Schmidt double, with its unique piston change valve, is occasionally found in sections playing Geyer/Knopf model equipment.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n===Detachable bell===\nThe horn, although not large, is awkward in its shape and does not lend itself well to transport where space is shared or limited, especially on planes. To compensate, horn makers can make the bell detachable; this allows for smaller and more manageable horn cases.\n\n==Related horns==\n{{Main|Horn (instrument)}}\nThe variety in horn history necessitates consideration of the natural horn, Vienna horn, mellophone, marching horn, and Wagner tuba.\n\n===Natural horn===\n[[File:Natural Horn (instrument).JPG|left|thumb|A natural horn has no valves, but can be tuned to a different key by inserting different tubing, as during a rest period.]]\n{{Main|Natural horn}}\nThe [[natural horn]] is the ancestor of the modern horn. It is essentially descended from hunting horns, with its pitch controlled by air speed, aperture (opening of the lips through which air passes) and the use of the right hand moving around, as well as in and out of the bell. Although a few recent composers have written specifically for the natural horn (e.g., [[Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti]]'s ''[[Hamburg Concerto]]''), today it is played primarily as a [[Historically informed performance|period instrument]]. The natural horn can only play from a single harmonic series at a time because there is only one length of tubing available to the horn player. A proficient player can indeed alter the pitch by partially muting the bell with the right hand, thus enabling the player to reach some notes that are not part of the instrument's natural harmonic series \u2013 of course this technique also affects the quality of the tone. The player has a choice of key by using crooks to change the length of tubing.\n\n===Vienna horn===\n[[File:Viennese horn.jpg|thumb|300px|Vienna horn]]\n{{Main|Vienna horn}}\nThe [[Vienna horn]] is a special horn used primarily in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]]. Instead of using [[rotary valve]]s or [[piston valve]]s, it uses the pumpenvalve (or Vienna valve), which is a double-piston operating inside the valve slides, and usually situated on the opposite side of the corpus from the player's left hand, and operated by a long pushrod. Unlike the modern horn, which has grown considerably larger internally (for a bigger, broader, and louder tone), and considerably heavier (with the addition of valves and tubing in the case of the double horn) the Vienna horn very closely mimics the size and weight of the natural horn, (although the valves do add some weight, they are lighter than rotary valves) even using crooks in the front of the horn, between the mouthpiece and the instrument. Although instead of the full range of keys, Vienna horn players usually use an F crook and it is looked down upon to use others, though switching to an A or B{{music|flat}} crook for higher pitched music does happen on occasion. Vienna horns are often used with funnel shaped mouthpieces similar to those used on the natural horn, with very little (if any) backbore and a very thin rim. The Viennese horn requires very specialized technique and can be quite challenging to play, even for accomplished players of modern horns. The Vienna horn has a warmer, softer sound than the modern horn. Its pumpenvalves facilitate a continuous transition between notes ([[glissando]]); conversely, a more precise operating of the valves is required to avoid notes that sound out of tune.\n\n===Mellophone===\n{{Main|Mellophone}}\nTwo instruments are called a ''mellophone''. The first is an instrument shaped somewhat like a horn, in that it is formed in a circle. It has piston valves and is played with the right hand on the valves. Manufacturing of this instrument sharply decreased in the middle of the 20th century, and this mellophone (or mellophonium) rarely appears today.\n\nThe second instrument is used in modern brass bands and marching bands, and is more accurately called a \"marching mellophone\" or mellophone. A derivative of the F [[alto horn]], it is keyed in F. It is shaped like a flugelhorn, with piston valves played with the right hand and a forward-pointing bell. These horns are generally considered better [[marching instrument]]s than regular horns because their position is more stable on the mouth, they project better, and they weigh less. It is primarily used as the middle voice of [[drum and bugle corps (modern)|drum and bugle corps]]. Though they are usually played with a V-cup cornet-like mouthpiece, their range overlaps the common playing range of the horn. This mouthpiece switch makes the mellophone louder, less mellow, and more brassy and brilliant, making it more appropriate for marching bands. Often now with the use of converters, traditional conical horn mouthpieces are used to achieve the more mellow sound of a horn to make the marching band sound more like a concert band.\n\nAs they are pitched in F or G and their range overlaps that of the horn, mellophones can be used in place of the horn in brass and marching band settings. Mellophones are, however, sometimes unpopular with horn players because the mouthpiece change can be difficult and requires a different [[embouchure]]. Mouthpiece adapters are available so that a horn mouthpiece can fit into the mellophone lead pipe, but this does not compensate for the many differences that a horn player must adapt to. The \"feel\" of the mellophone can be foreign to a horn player. Another unfamiliar aspect of the mellophone is that it is designed to be played with the right hand instead of the left (though it can be played with the left). Intonation can also be an issue with the mellophone.{{Why|date=July 2016}}\n\nWhile horn players may be asked to play the mellophone, it is unlikely that the instrument was ever intended as a substitute for the horn, mainly because of the fundamental differences described.<ref>{{cite web | title= The History of the Mellophone | url= http://www.alsmiddlebrasspages.com/mellophone/history.html | last= Monks | first= Greg | date= 2006-01-06 | publisher= Al's Mellophone Page | accessdate= 2008-07-29}}</ref> As an instrument it compromises between the ability to sound like a horn, while being used like a trumpet or flugelhorn, a tradeoff that sacrifices acoustic properties for ergonomics.\n\n===Marching horn===\nThe marching horn is quite similar to the mellophone in shape and appearance, but is pitched in the key of B{{music|flat}}, the same as the B{{music|flat}} side of a double horn. It is also available in F alto, one octave above the F side of a double horn. The marching horn is also played with a horn mouthpiece (unlike the mellophone, which needs an adapter to fit the horn mouthpiece). These instruments are primarily used in marching bands so the sound comes from a forward-facing bell, as dissipation of the sound from the backward-facing bell becomes a concern in open-air environments. Many college marching bands and drum corps, however, use mellophones instead, which, with many marching bands, better balance the tone of the other brass instruments; additionally, mellophones require less special training of trumpeters, who considerably outnumber horn players.<ref>Mellophones, as indicated, use the same fingering as trumpets and are operated by the right hand.</ref>\n\n===Wagner tuba===\n{{Main|Wagner tuba}}\nThe Wagner tuba is a rare brass instrument that is essentially a horn modified to have a larger bell throat and a vertical bell. Despite its name, it is generally not considered part of the [[tuba]] family. Invented for [[Richard Wagner]] specifically for his work ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'', it has since been written for by various other composers, including [[Bruckner]], [[Stravinsky]] and [[Richard Strauss]]. It uses a horn mouthpiece and is available as a single tuba in B{{music|flat}} or F, or, more recently, as a double tuba similar to the double horn. Its common range is similar to that of the [[euphonium]], but its possible range is the same as that of the horn, extending from low F{{music|sharp}}, below the bass clef staff to high C above the treble staff when read in F. These low pedals are substantially easier to play on the Wagner tuba than on the horn. Wagner viewed the regular horn as a woodwind rather than a brass instrument, evidenced by his placing of the horn parts in his orchestral scores in the woodwind group and not in their usual place above the trumpets in the brass section.\n\n==Repertoire==\n[[File:Paxman-horns.jpg|thumb|left|Paxman horns]]\n{{See also|List of compositions for horn}}\n\nDiscussion of the repertoire of horns must recognize the different needs of orchestras and concert bands in contrast to marching bands, as above, but also the use of horns in a wide variety of music, including chamber music and jazz.\n\n===Orchestra and concert band===\nThe horn is most often used as an orchestral and concert band instrument, with its singular tone being employed by composers to achieve specific effects. [[Leopold Mozart]], for example, used horns to signify the hunt, as in his ''[[Jagdsinfonie]]'' (hunting symphony). [[Georg Philipp Telemann|Telemann]] wrote much for the horn, and it features prominently in the work of [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]] and in [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]'s ''Brandenburg Concerto no. 1''. Once the technique of [[hand-stopping]] had been developed, allowing fully chromatic playing, composers began to write seriously for the horn. [[Gustav Mahler]] made great use of the horn's uniquely haunting and distant sound in his symphonies, notably the famous ''Nachtmusik'' (serenade) section of his [[Symphony No. 7 (Mahler)|Symphony No. 7]].\n\nMany composers have written works that have become favorites in the horn repertoire. These include [[Francis Poulenc|Poulenc]] (''Elegie'') and [[Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns|Saint-Sa\u00ebns]] (''Morceau de Concert for horn and orchestra'', op. 94 and ''Romance'', op. 36). Others, particularly [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], whose friend [[Joseph Leutgeb]] was a noted horn player, wrote extensively for the instrument, including [[concerto|concerti]] and other solo works. Mozart's ''[[A Musical Joke]]'' satirizes the limitations of contemporary horn playing, including the risk of selecting the wrong crook by mistake.\n\nThe development of the valve horn was exploited by romantic composers such as [[Anton Bruckner|Bruckner]], [[Mahler]], and [[Richard Strauss]], whose father was a well-known professional horn player. Strauss's ''[[Till Eulenspiegel's Merry Pranks]]'' contains one of the best known horn solos from this period, relying on the chromatic facility of the valved horn. [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]]'s ''Konzertst\u00fcck'' for four horns and orchestra is a notable three-movement work. Brahms had a lifelong love-affair with the instrument, with many prominently featured parts throughout his four symphonies. However players today typically play Brahms on modern valved instruments.\n\n===Chamber music===\nThere is an abundance of chamber music repertoire for horn. It is a standard member of the [[wind quintet]] and [[brass quintet]], and often appears in other configurations, such as Brahms' [[Horn Trio (Brahms)|Horn Trio]] for violin, horn and piano (for which, however, Brahms specified the natural horn). Also, the horn can be used by itself in a horn ensemble or \"horn choir\". The horn choir is especially practical because the extended range of the horn provides the composer or arranger with more possibilities, registerally, sonically, and contrapuntally.\n\n==Orchestral and concert band horns==\n[[File:DSC 8763 (7084102945).jpg|thumb|300px|A horn section in a military [[concert band]]]]\nA classical orchestra usually has at least two French horn players. Typically, the first horn played a high part and the second horn played a low part. Composers from [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] (early 1800s) onwards commonly used four horns. Here, the first and second horns played as a pair (first horn being high, second horn being low), and the third and fourth horns played as another pair (third horn being high, fourth horn being low). \n\nMusic written for the modern horn follows a similar pattern with the first and third horns being high and the second and fourth horns being low. This configuration serves multiple purposes. It is easier to play high when the adjacent player is playing low and vice versa. Pairing makes it easier to write for horns, as the third and fourth horns can take over from the first and second horns or play contrasting material. For example, if the piece is in C minor, the first and second horns might be in C, the tonic major key, which could get most of the notes, and the third and fourth horns might be in E{{music|flat}}, the relative major key, to fill in the gaps. \n\nMany orchestral horn sections in the 2010s also have an assistant<ref>Erickson, John. [http://hornmatters.com/2010/03/horn-sections-with-and-without-an-associate-principal/ \"Horn Sections With and Without an Associate Principal\"] 28 March 2010. Retrieved 14 January 2012</ref> who doubles the first horn part for selected passages, joining in loud parts, playing instead of the principal if there is a first horn solo approaching, or alternating with the principal if the part is tiring to play.<ref>Bacon, Thomas. [http://www.hornplanet.com/hornpage/museum/articles/associate.html \"The Horn Section\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304081850/http://www.hornplanet.com/hornpage/museum/articles/associate.html |date=March 4, 2016 }} Retrieved 14 January 2012</ref> Often the assistant is asked to play a passage after resting a long time. Also, he or she may be asked to enter in the middle of a passage, exactly matching the sound, articulation, and overall interpretation of the principal, thus enabling the principal horn to rest a bit.\n\n==In jazz==\n{{See also|Category:Jazz horn players|French horn in jazz}}\nThe French horn was at first rarely used in [[jazz]] music (Note that colloquially in jazz, the word \"horn\" refers to any wind instrument). Notable exponents, however, began including French horn in jazz pieces and ensembles. These include composer/arranger [[Gil Evans]] who included the French horn as an ensemble instrument from the 1940s, first in [[Claude Thornhill]]'s groups, and later with the pioneering [[cool jazz]] nonet (nine-piece group) led by trumpeter [[Miles Davis]], and in many other projects that sometimes also featured Davis, as well as [[Don Ellis]], a trumpet player from [[Stan Kenton]]'s jazz band. Notable works of Ellis' jazz French horn include \"Strawberry Soup\" and other songs on the album ''[[Tears of Joy (album)|Tears of Joy]]''. Notable improvising horn players in jazz include [[Julius Watkins]], [[Willie Ruff]], [[John Graas]], [[David Amram]], [[John Clark (musician)|John Clark]], [[Vincent Chancey]], [http://onesheet.com/marktaylormusic/ Mark Taylor], Giovanni Hoffer, [[Arkady Shilkloper]], Adam Unsworth, and [[Tom Varner]].\n\n==Notable horn players==\n{{See also|List of horn players}}\n<!-- We do not need any more examples on this page.

Nothing is known of his parents. He was baptized Guido or Guidolino.  The earliest recorded document concerning Fra Angelico dates from October 17, 1417 when he joined a religious confraternity or guild at the [[Our Lady of Mount Carmel|Carmine]] Church, still under the name of Guido di Pietro.  This record reveals that he was already a painter, a fact that is subsequently confirmed by two records of payment to Guido di Pietro in January and February 1418 for work done in the church of Santo Stefano del Ponte.<ref>Werner Cohn,  ''Il Beato Angelico e Battista di Biagio Sanguigni.''

Florence: Leo S. Olschki Editore, 1964.</ref>  He was a member of the local community at Fiesole, not far from Florence, of the [[Dominican Order]]; one of the medieval Orders belonging to a category known as [[mendicant Orders]] because they generally lived not from the income of estates but from begging or donations. [[Fra]], a contraction of ''frater'' (Latin for 'brother'), is a conventional title for a mendicant friar.\n\nAccording to Vasari, Fra Angelico initially received training as an [[Illuminated manuscripts|illuminator]], possibly working with his older brother [[Benedetto da Fiesole|Benedetto]] who was also a Dominican and an illuminator. The former Dominican convent of [[San Marco, Florence|San Marco]] in Florence, now a state museum, holds several manuscripts that are thought to be entirely or partly by his hand.<ref name=Vasari/> The painter [[Lorenzo Monaco]] may have contributed to his art training, and the influence of the [[Sienese school]] is discernible in his work.{{sfn|Rossetti|1911|pp=6-7}} He had several important charges in the [[convent]]s he lived in, but this did not limit his art, which very soon became famous.  According to [[Vasari]], the first paintings of this artist were an [[altarpiece]] and a painted screen for the [[Carthusians|Charterhouse (Carthusian monastery)]] of [[Florence Charterhouse|Florence]]; none such exist there now.<ref name=Vasari/>\n\nFrom 1408 to 1418, Fra Angelico was at the [[San Domenico, Cortona|Dominican friary of Cortona]], where he painted frescoes, now mostly destroyed, in the Dominican Church and may have been assistant to [[Gherardo Starnina]] or a follower of his.<ref>{{cite web\n |title       = Gherardo Starnina\n |work        = Artists\n |publisher   = [[Getty Center]]\n |url         = http://www.getty.edu/art/gettyguide/artMakerDetails?maker=1188\n |accessdate  = 2007-09-28\n |deadurl     = yes\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20070926215032/http://www.getty.edu/art/gettyguide/artMakerDetails?maker=1188\n |archivedate = 2007-09-26\n |df          = \n}}Getty Education[]</ref> Between 1418 and 1436 he was at the [[Convent of San Domenico, Fiesole|convent of Fiesole]], where he also executed a number of frescoes for the church and the [[Fiesole Altarpiece|Altarpiece]], which was deteriorated but has since been restored. A predella of the [[Fiesole Altarpiece|Altarpiece]] remains intact and is conserved in the [[National Gallery, London]], and is a great example of Fra Angelico's ability. It shows Christ in Glory surrounded by more than 250 figures, including beatified Dominicans.\n\n===San Marco, Florence, 1436\u20131445===\n[[File:ANGELICO, Fra Annunciation, 1437-46 (2236990916).jpg|thumb|upright= 1.25|''The Virgin of the Annunciation'']]\nIn 1436, Fra Angelico was one of a number of the friars from Fiesole who moved to the newly built [[San Marco, Florence|convent or friary of San Marco]] in Florence. This was an important move which put him in the centre of artistic activity of the region and brought about the patronage of one of the wealthiest and most powerful members of the city's governing authority, or \"Signoria\" (namely [[Cosimo de' Medici]]), who had a cell reserved for himself at the friary in order that he might retreat from the world. \nIt was, according to Vasari, at Cosimo's urging that Fra Angelico set about the task of decorating the convent, including the magnificent fresco of the Chapter House, the often-reproduced [[Annunciation (Fra Angelico, San Marco)|Annunciation]] at the top of the stairs leading to the cells, the Maesta (or Coronation of the Madonna) with Saints (cell 9) and the many other devotional frescoes, of smaller format but remarkable luminous quality, depicting aspects of the Life of Christ that adorn the walls of each cell.<ref name=Vasari/>\n\nIn 1439 Fra Angelico completed one of his most famous works, the ''[[San Marco Altarpiece]]'' at Florence. The result was unusual for its time. Images of the enthroned Madonna and Child surrounded by saints were common, but they usually depicted a setting that was clearly heaven-like, in which saints and angels hovered about as divine presences rather than people. But in this instance, the saints stand squarely within the space, grouped in a natural way as if they were able to converse about the shared experience of witnessing the Virgin in glory. Paintings such as this, known as [[Sacred Conversation]]s, were to become the major commissions of [[Giovanni Bellini]], [[Perugino]] and [[Raphael]].<ref name=Hartt>Frederick Hartt, ''A History of Italian Renaissance Art'', (1970) Thames & Hudson, {{ISBN|0-500-23136-2}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Fra Angelico - San Marco Altarpiece - WGA00509 02.jpg|thumb|left|''[[San Marco Altarpiece]]'']]\n\n===The Vatican, 1445\u20131455===\n[[File:Fra Angelico 012.jpg|thumb|180px|right|''The Crucified Christ'']]\n\nIn 1445 [[Pope Eugene IV]] summoned him to Rome to paint the frescoes of the Chapel of the [[Holy Sacrament]] at [[St Peter's Basilica|St Peter's]], later demolished by [[Pope Paul III]]. Vasari claims that at this time Fra Angelico was offered the [[Archbishopric of Florence]] by [[Pope Nicholas V]], and that he refused it, recommending another friar for the position. The story seems possible and even likely. However, if Vasari's date is correct, then the pope must have been [[Pope Eugene IV|Eugene IV]] and not [[Pope Nicholas V|Nicholas]], who was elected Pope only on 6 March 1447. Moreover, the archbishop in 1446\u20131459 was the Dominican [[Antoninus of Florence]] (Antonio Pierozzi), canonized by [[Pope Adrian VI]] in 1523. In 1447 Fra Angelico was in [[Orvieto]] with his pupil, [[Benozzo Gozzoli]], executing works for the [[Duomo di Orvieto|Cathedral]]. Among his other pupils were [[Zanobi Strozzi]].<ref>{{cite web\n  | title =Strozzi, Zanobi \n  | work =\n  | publisher =[[The National Gallery, London]]\n  | url =http://www.nationalgalleryimages.co.uk/search.aspx?q=STROZZI%2C+Zanobi&mode=artist&frm=1\n  | accessdate = 2007-09-28 }}</ref>\n\nFrom 1447 to 1449 Fra Angelico was back at the Vatican, designing the frescoes for the [[Niccoline Chapel]] for Nicholas V. The scenes from the lives of the two martyred [[deacon]]s of the Early Christian Church, [[St. Stephen]] and [[St. Lawrence]] may have been executed wholly or in part by assistants. The small chapel, with its brightly frescoed walls and gold leaf decorations gives the impression of a jewel box.  From 1449 until 1452, Fra Angelico returned to his old convent of Fiesole, where he was the Prior.<ref name=Vasari/><ref name=WMR/>\n\n===Death and beatification===\n[[File:Fra Angelico, Fra Filippo Lippi, The Adoration of the Magi.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The ''[[Adoration of the Magi (Fra Angelico and Filippo Lippi)|Adoration of the Magi]]'' is a [[Tondo (art)|tondo]] of the [[Adoration of the Magi]].

He led the devout and ascetic life of a Dominican friar, and never rose above that rank; he followed the dictates of the order in caring for the poor; he was always good-humored. All of his many paintings were of divine subjects, and it seems that he never altered or retouched them, perhaps from a religious conviction that, because his paintings were divinely inspired, they should retain their original form. He was wont to say that he who illustrates the acts of Christ should be with Christ. It is averred that he never handled a brush without fervent prayer and he wept when he painted a Crucifixion. [[The Last Judgment (Angelico)|The Last Judgment]] and the Annunciation were two of the subjects he most frequently treated.{{sfn|Rossetti|1911|p=7}}<ref name=WMR>{{cite web |url=https://orderofpreachersindependent.org/2016/03/18/fra-angelico-2/ |title=Fra Angelico |accessdate=1 May 2016 |author=Rossetti, William Michael (as attributed) |publisher=orderofpreachersindependent.org}}</ref>}}\n\nPope John Paul II beatified Fra Angelico on October 3, 1982, and in 1984 declared him patron of Catholic artists.<ref name=\"blessed\"/>{{quote|Angelico was reported to say \"He who does Christ's work must stay with Christ always\".

It shows the precision, detail and colour required in a commissioned work]]\n\n===Background===\nFra Angelico was working at a time when the style of painting was in a state of change. This process of change had begun a hundred years previous with the works of [[Giotto]] and several of his contemporaries, notably [[Giusto de' Menabuoi]], both of whom had created their major works in [[Padua, Italy|Padua]], although Giotto was trained in [[Florence]] by the great Gothic artist, [[Cimabue]], and painted a fresco cycle of St Francis in the Bardi Chapel in the [[Basilica di Santa Croce]]. Giotto had many enthusiastic followers, who imitated his style in [[fresco]], some of them, notably the [[Pietro Lorenzetti|Lorenzetti]], achieving great success.<ref name=Hartt/>\n\n===Patronage===\n\nThe [[Patronage|patrons]] of these artists were most often monastic establishments or wealthy families endowing a church. Because the paintings often had devotional purpose, the clients tended to be conservative. Frequently, it would seem, the wealthier the client, the more conservative the painting. There was a very good reason for this. The paintings that were commissioned made a statement about the patron. Thus the more [[gold leaf]]  it displayed, the more it spoke to the patron's glory. The other valuable commodities in the paint-box were [[lapis lazuli]] and [[vermilion]]. Paint made from these colours did not lend itself to a tonal treatment. The azure blue made of powdered lapis lazuli went on flat, the depth and brilliance of colour being, like the gold leaf, a sign of the patron's ability to provide well. For these reasons, [[altarpiece]]s are often much more conservatively painted than frescoes, which were often of almost life-sized figures and relied upon a stage-set quality rather than lavish display in order to achieve effect.<ref>Michael Baxandall, ''Painting and Experience in Fifteenth Century Italy'',(1974) Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-881329-5}}</ref>\n\n===Contemporaries===\nFra Angelico was the contemporary of [[Gentile da Fabriano]]. Gentile's altarpiece of the ''[[Adoration of the Magi (Gentile da Fabriano)|Adoration of the Magi]]'', 1423, in the [[Uffizi]] is regarded as one of the greatest works of the style known as [[International Gothic]]. At the time it was painted, another young artist, known as Masaccio, was working on the frescoes for the [[Brancacci Chapel]] at the church of the Carmine. [[Masaccio]] had fully grasped the implications of the art of [[Giotto]]. Few painters in Florence saw his sturdy, lifelike and emotional figures and were not affected by them. His work partner was an older painter, [[Masolino]], of the same generation as Fra Angelico. Masaccio died at 27, leaving the work unfinished.<ref name=Hartt/>\n\n===Altarpieces===\nThe works of Fra Angelico reveal elements that are both conservatively [[Gothic art|Gothic]] and progressively [[Renaissance]]. In the altarpiece of the [[Coronation of the Virgin]], painted for the Florentine church of [[Santa Maria Novella]], are all the elements that a very expensive altarpiece of the 14th century was expected to provide; a precisely tooled gold background, lots of azure, lots of vermilion and an obvious display of [[arsenic]] green. The workmanship of the gilded haloes and gold-edged robes is exquisite and all very Gothic. What makes this a Renaissance painting, as against Gentile da Fabriano's masterpiece, is the solidity, the three-dimensionality and naturalism of the figures and the realistic way in which their garments hang or drape around them. Even though it is clouds these figures stand upon, and not the earth, they do so with weight.<ref name=Hartt/>\n\n[[File:Fra Angelico 042 adjusted.jpg|220px|thumb|left|''The [[Transfiguration of Jesus|Transfiguration]]'' shows the directness, simplicity and restrained palette typical of these frescoes.  Located in a monk's cell at the Convent San' Marco, its apparent purpose is to encourage private devotion.]]\n\n===Frescoes===\nThe series of [[frescoes]] that Fra Angelico painted for the Dominican friars at San Marcos realise the advancements made by Masaccio and carry them further. Away from the constraints of wealthy clients and the limitations of panel painting, Fra Angelico was able to express his deep reverence for his God and his knowledge and love of humanity. The meditational frescoes in  the cells of the convent have a quieting quality about them. They are humble works in simple colours. There is more mauvish-pink than there is red, and the brilliant and expensive blue is almost totally lacking. In its place is dull green and the black and white of Dominican robes. There is nothing lavish, nothing to distract from the spiritual experiences of the humble people who are depicted within the frescoes. Each one has the effect of bringing an incident of the life of Christ into the presence of the viewer. They are like windows into a parallel world. These frescoes remain a powerful witness to the piety of the man who created them.<ref name=Hartt/>\nVasari relates that [[Cosimo de' Medici]] seeing these works, inspired Fra Angelico to create a large [[Crucifixion]] scene with many saints for the [[Chapter House]]. As with the other frescoes, the wealthy patronage did not influence the Friar's artistic expression with displays of wealth.<ref name=Vasari/>\n\nMasaccio ventured into perspective with his creation of a realistically painted niche at [[Santa Maria Novella]]. Subsequently, Fra Angelico demonstrated an understanding of [[linear perspective]] particularly in his Annunciation paintings set inside the sort of arcades that [[Michelozzo]] and [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]] created at San\u2019 Marco's and the square in front of it.<ref name=Hartt/>\n\n===Lives of the Saints===\n[[File:Angelico, niccolina 12.jpg|thumb|''[[Saint Lawrence]] distributing alms'' (1447), in the Vatican, incorporates the expensive pigments, gold leaf and elaborate design typical of Vatican commissions.]]\n\nWhen Fra Angelico and his assistants went to the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] to decorate the chapel of Pope Nicholas, the artist was again confronted with the need to please the very wealthiest of clients. In consequence, walking into the small chapel is like stepping into a jewel box. The walls are decked with the brilliance of colour and gold that one sees in the most lavish creations of the Gothic painter [[Simone Martini]] at the Lower Church of [[St Francis of Assisi]], a hundred years earlier. Yet Fra Angelico has succeeded in creating designs which continue to reveal his own preoccupation with humanity, with humility and with piety. The figures, in their lavish gilded robes, have the sweetness and gentleness for which his works are famous. According to Vasari:\n<blockquote>In their bearing and expression, the saints painted by Fra Angelico come nearer to the truth than the figures done by any other artist.<ref name=Vasari/></blockquote>\n\nIt is probable that much of the actual painting was done by his assistants to his design. Both Benozzo Gozzoli and Gentile da Fabriano were highly accomplished painters. Benozzo took his art further towards the fully developed Renaissance style with his expressive and lifelike portraits in his masterpiece depicting the [[Three Kings|Journey of the Magi]], painted in the [[Medici]]'s private chapel at their [[palazzo]].<ref>Paolo Morachiello, ''Fra Angelico: The San Marco Frescoes''. Thames and Hudson, 1990. {{ISBN|0-500-23729-8}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Blessing Redeemer (1423); Fra Angelico1.jpg|thumb|left|''Blessing Redeemer'' (1423)]]\n\n===Artistic legacy===\nThrough Fra Angelico's pupil Benozzo Gozzoli's careful portraiture and technical expertise in the art of fresco we see a link to [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]], who in turn painted extensive schemes for the wealthy patrons of Florence, and through Ghirlandaio to his pupil [[Michelangelo]] and the High Renaissance.\n\nApart from the lineal connection, superficially there may seem little to link the humble priest with his sweetly pretty [[Virgin Mary|Madonnas]] and timeless [[Crucifixion of Christ|Crucifixions]] to the dynamic expressions of Michelangelo's larger-than-life creations. But both these artists received their most important commissions from the wealthiest and most powerful of all patrons, the Vatican.\n\nWhen Michelangelo took up the Sistine Chapel commission, he was working within a space that had already been extensively decorated by other artists. Around the walls the ''Life of Christ'' and ''Life of  Moses'' were depicted  by a range of artists including his teacher [[Domenico Ghirlandaio|Ghirlandaio]], [[Raphael]]'s teacher [[Perugino]] and [[Botticelli]]. They were works of large scale and exactly the sort of lavish treatment to be expected in a Vatican commission, vying with each other in complexity of design, number of figures, elaboration of detail and skillful use of gold leaf. Above these works stood a row of painted Popes in brilliant brocades and gold tiaras. None of these splendours have any place in the work which Michelangelo created. Michelangelo, when asked by [[Pope Julius II]] to ornament the robes of the Apostles in the usual way, responded that they were very poor men.<ref name=Hartt/>\n\nWithin the cells of San\u2019Marco, Fra Angelico had demonstrated that painterly skill and the artist's personal interpretation were sufficient to create memorable works of art, without the expensive trappings of blue and gold. In the use of the unadorned fresco technique, the clear bright pastel colours, the careful arrangement of a few significant figures and the skillful use of expression, motion and gesture, Michelangelo showed himself to be the artistic descendant of Fra Angelico. Frederick Hartt describes Fra Angelico as \"prophetic of the mysticism\" of painters such as [[Rembrandt]], [[El Greco]] and [[Zurbar\u00e1n]].<ref name=Hartt/>\n\n==Works==\n[[File:Angelico, pala di fiesole, full.jpg|thumb|right|''Virgin and Child with Saints'', detail, Fiesole (1428\u20131430)]]\n\n===Early works, 1408\u20131436===\n'''Rome'''\n* Panel, ''[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/43.98.5/ The Crucifixion]'' (c. 1420-1423), possibly Fra Angelico's only signed work.

Marco''',{{sfn|Baynes|1878|p=194}} and his original name '''Baccio della Porta''',{{sfn|Baynes|1878|p=194}} was an [[Italian people|Italian]] [[Renaissance]] painter of religious subjects.  He spent all his career in [[Florence]] until his mid-forties, when he travelled to work in various cities, as far south as Rome.  He trained with [[Cosimo Roselli]] and in the 1490s fell under the influence of [[Savonarola]], which led him to become a [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[friar]] in 1500, renouncing painting for several years.\n\nHe was instructed to resume painting for the benefit of his order in 1504, and then developed an idealized [[High Renaissance]] style, seen in his ''Vision of St Bernard'' of that year, now in poor condition but whose \"figures and drapery move with a seraphic grace that must have struck the young [[Raphael]] with the force of revelation\".{{sfn|Hartt|1987|p=477}}  He remained friends with Raphael, and each influenced the other.\n\nHis portrait of Savonarola remains the most famous image of the reformer. Fra Bartolomeo painted both in oils and fresco, and some of his drawings are pure landscape sketches that are the earliest of this type from Italy.\n\n{{anchor|Biography|History}}\n\n==Life==\n[[Image:Bartolommeo, Fra ~ The Holy Family with the Infant St John in a Landscape.jpg|thumb|right|''Holy Family with the Infant St John''.]]\nHe was born in [[Savignano di Prato]], [[Tuscany]]. He received the nickname of Baccio della Porta for his house was near the Gate of San Pier Gattolini.{{refn|group=n|\"Baccio\" is an [[Italian diminutive]] for \"[[Bartolommeo (name)|Bartolommeo]]\".}}\n\nStarting from 1483 or 1484, by recommendation of [[Benedetto da Maiano]], he apprenticed in the workshop of [[Cosimo Rosselli]]. He was one of the greatest painters of his time. In 1490 or 1491 he began a collaboration with [[Mariotto Albertinelli]]. In the late 1490s Baccio was drawn to the teachings of [[Girolamo Savonarola|Fra Girolamo Savonarola]], who denounced what he viewed as vain and corrupt contemporary art. Savonarola argued for art serving as a direct visual illustration of the [[Bible]] to educate those unable to read the book.  From 1498 is his famous portrait of Savonarola, now in the [[Museo Nazionale di San Marco]] in Florence. The following year he was commissioned a fresco of the ''Universal Judgement'' for the [[Ospedale di Santa Maria Nuova]], completed by Albertinelli and [[Giuliano Bugiardini]] when Baccio became a [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[friar]] on July 26, 1500. The following year he entered the convent of San Marco.\n\nHe renounced painting for several years, not resuming until 1504 when he became the head of the monastery workshop in obedience to his superior. In that year he began a ''Vision of St. Bernard'' for Bernardo Bianco's family chapel in the [[Badia Fiorentina]], finished in 1507.\nSoon thereafter, [[Raphael]] visited Florence and befriended the friar. Bartolomeo learned perspective from the younger artist, while Raphael added skills in coloring and handling of drapery, which was noticeable in the works he produced after their meeting. With Raphael, he remained on the friendliest terms, and when he departed from Rome, left in his hands two unfinished pictures which Raphael completed.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=451}}\n\nAt the beginning of 1508 Bartolomeo moved to [[Venice]] to paint a ''Holy Father, St. Mary Magdalene and St. Catherine of Siena'' for the Dominicans of [[San Pietro Martire, Murano|San Pietro Martire]] in [[Murano]], influenced somewhat by Venetian colorism. As the Dominicans did not pay for the work, he took it back to [[Lucca]], where it can be seen now. Also in Lucca, in October 1509, he painted with Albertinelli an altarpiece of the ''Madonna and Child with Saints'' for the [[Cathedral of Lucca|local cathedral]]. On November 26, 1510 [[Pier Soderini]] commissioned him an altarpiece for the Sala del Consiglio of Florence, now in the Museum of San Marco. Two years later he finished another altarpiece  for the [[Besan\u00e7on Cathedral|cathedral]] of [[Besan\u00e7on]].\n\nIn 1513 he went to Rome, where he painted a ''Peter and Paul'', now in the [[Pinacoteca Vaticana]], while from the following years are the ''[[Mark the Evangelist|St. Mark Evangelist]]'' of [[Palazzo Pitti]] in Florence and the frescoes in the Dominican convent of Pian di Mugnone, a [[frazione]] of [[Fiesole]], just outside Florence. After a promised ''Feast of Venus'' for Duke [[Alfonso I d'Este]] of [[Ferrara]], of which only drawings remain, his last work is a fresco of ''[[Noli me tangere]]'' also in Pian di Mugnone.\n[[File:Fra bartolomeo 03 Christ with the Four Evangelists.jpg|thumbnail|Fra Bartolomeo: ''Christ with the [[Four Evangelists]]'']]\n\nHe died in Florence in 1517.\n\n==Works==\n\n===Style===\n[[File:Fra Bartolomeo 003.jpg|thumb|''Piet\u00e0'' (1516). [[Palazzo Pitti]], Florence.]]\n[[File:Fra Bartolomeo - The Adoration of the Christ Child (detail) - WGA01358.jpg|thumb|''The Adoration of the Christ Child'' (detail)]]\nInitially, his works showed the influence of Rosselli's assistant, [[Piero di Cosimo]], and those of [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]] and [[Filippino Lippi]]. After his hiatus from 1500 to 1503, he seemed to change vision, taking from Raphael the representation of light and its effects over moving shapes.\n\nFra Bartolomeo's figures are generally small and draped. These qualities were alleged against him as defects, and to prove that his style was not the result of want of power, he painted the magnificent figure of the ''St Mark Evangelist'' (ranked as his masterpiece), and the undraped figure of [[Saint Sebastian]]. It is alleged that the latter was felt to be so strongly expressive of suffering and agony, that it was found necessary to remove it from the place where it had been exhibited in the chapel of a convent.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=451}}\n\nFra Bartolomeo's compositions are remarkable for skill in the massing of light and shade, richness and delicacy of colouring, and for the admirable drapery of the figures, Bartolomeo having been the first to introduce and use the lay-figure with joints.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=451}}\n\nAmong his pupils were Cecchino del Frate, Benedetto Ciamfanini, Gabriel Rustici, [[Ridolfo Ghirlandaio]] (the son of Domenico Ghirlandaio), and [[Fra Paolo Pistolese]].<ref>Vasari, ''Vite, Terza Parte''.</ref>\n\n===Pieces===\n*''Assumption of Mary'' (1508) -

He became interested in painting after seeing some works of [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix]]. His family agreed to let him study painting, but only if he also studied medicine.<ref name=\"bio\"/>\n\nBazille began studying medicine in 1859, and moved to [[Paris]] in 1862 to continue his studies. There he met [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]] and [[Alfred Sisley]], was drawn to Impressionist painting, and began taking classes in [[Charles Gleyre]]'s studio. After failing his medical exam in 1864, he began painting full-time. His close friends included [[Claude Monet]], [[Alfred Sisley]], and [[\u00c9douard Manet]]. Bazille was generous with his wealth, and helped support his less fortunate associates by giving them space in his studio and materials to use.<ref name=\"bio\"/>\n\nBazille was just twenty-three years old when he painted several of his best-known works, including ''[[The Pink Dress]]'' (c. 1864, [[Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay]], Paris). This painting combines a portrait-like depiction of Bazille's cousin, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se des Hours, who is seen from behind\u2014and the sunlit landscape at which she gazes.<ref>Rosenblum, 1989, p. 225</ref> His best-known painting is ''[[Family Reunion (painting)|Family Reunion]]'' of 1867\u20131868 (Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, Paris).\n\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bazille joined a [[Zouave]] regiment in August 1870, a month after the outbreak of the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. On November 28 of that year, he was with his unit at the [[Battle of Beaune-la-Rolande]] when, his officer having been injured, he took command and led an assault on the German position. He was hit twice in the failed attack and died on the battlefield at the age of twenty-eight. His father travelled to the battlefield a few days later to take his body back for burial at Montpellier over a week later.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/2017/frederic-bazille-and-the-birth-of-impressionism.html|title=Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bazille and the Birth of Impressionism|website=www.nga.gov|access-date=2018-10-19}}</ref>\n\n==Main works==\n* ''[[La Robe rose]]'', (1864) \u2013 <small>  147 x 110&nbsp;cm, [[Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay]], Paris </small>\n* ''Atelier de la rue Furstenberg'', \u2013 <small> 80 x 65&nbsp;cm, [[Mus\u00e9e Fabre]], [[Montpellier]] </small>\n* ''[[Aigues-Mortes]]'', \u2013 <small> 46 x 55&nbsp;cm, Mus\u00e9e Fabre, Montpellier  </small>\n* ''[[Autoportrait (Bazille)|Autportrait]]'', (1865) \u2013 <small> 109x72 cm, [[Art Institute of Chicago]] </small>\n* ''[[R\u00e9union de Famille]]'', (1867) \u2013 <small>  152 x 230&nbsp;cm, Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, Paris </small>\n* ''[[Le P\u00e9cheur \u00e0 l'\u00e9pervier]]'', (1868) \u2013 <small>  134 x 83&nbsp;cm, [[Fondation Rau pour le tiers-monde]], [[Z\u00fcrich]] </small>\n* ''[[Vue de village]]'', (1868) \u2013 <small>   130 x 89&nbsp;cm, Mus\u00e9e Fabre, Montpellier </small>\n* ''[[Sc\u00e8ne d'\u00e9t\u00e9]]'', 1869 \u2013 <small> 158 x 158&nbsp;cm, [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], [[Harvard University]] </small>\n* ''[[La Toilette]]'', (1870) \u2013 <small>  132 x 127&nbsp;cm., Mus\u00e9e Fabre, Montpellier </small>\n* ''[[L'Atelier de la rue Condamine]]'', (1870) \u2013 <small>  98 x 128.5&nbsp;cm, Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, Paris </small>\n* ''[[Paysage au bord du Lez]]'', (1870) \u2013 <small>  137.8 x 202.5&nbsp;cm, [[The Minneapolis Institute of Arts]], [[Minneapolis]] </small>\n\n==Selected paintings==\n[[File:Pierre-Auguste Renoir - Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bazille.jpg|thumb|[[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], ''[[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bazille at his Easel|Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bazille painting The Heron ]]'']]\n<gallery widths=\"154px\" heights=\"168px\" perrow=\"4\">\nFile:Bazille, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric - Self Portrait.jpeg|''Self Portrait,'' unknown date\nFile:Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bazille - The Pink Dress - Google Art Project.jpg|''[[The Pink Dress|The Pink Dress (View of Castelnau-le-Lez, H\u00e9rault)]],'' 1864, oil on canvas, [[Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay]]\nImage:Bazille_Sutdio_in_the_rue_de_Furstenberg.jpg|''Studio in the Rue de Furstenberg,'' 1865, [[Mus\u00e9e Fabre]], oil on canvas, [[Fogg Art Museum]], [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]\nFile:Renoir by Bazille.jpg|''Portrait of Renoir'', 1867, oil on canvas, [[Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay]]\nFile:Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bazille - The Little Gardener - Google Art Project.jpg|''Le Petit Jardinier (The Little Gardener),'' c. 1866-67, oil on canvas [[Museum of Fine Arts, Houston]]\nFile:Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bazille - Nature morte avec du poisson.jpg| ''Nature morte avec du poisson'', Still life with fish, c. 1866-67. \nFile:Bazille, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric - Aigues-Mortes.jpeg|''[[Aigues-Mortes]]'', 1867\nImage:Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bazille 001.jpg|''[[The Family Reunion (painting)|The Family Reunion]]'', c. 1867, [[Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay]]\nFile:Bazille-Nature morte au h\u00e9ron.JPG|''Nature morte au h\u00e9ron'', 1867\nFile:Bazille, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric ~ View of the Village, 1868.jpg|''[[View of the Village]]'', 1868, [[Mus\u00e9e Fabre]] \nFile:Bazille - P\u00eacheur \u00e0 l'\u00e9pervier.jpg|''Fisherman with a Net'', 1868\nFile:Bazille, Frederic \u2014 Flowers \u2014 1868.jpg| ''Flowers'' \u2014 1868\nFile:Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bazille - Portrait de Paul Verlaine comme une Troubadour.jpg|''Portrait of [[Paul Verlaine]]'',  1868, [[Dallas Museum of Art]]\nImage:Bazille,_Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric_~_Summer_Scene,_1869,_Oil_on_canvas_Fogg_Art_Museum,_Cambridge,_Massachusetts.jpg|''[[Sc\u00e8ne d'\u00e9t\u00e9]],'' 1869,\nFile:Bazille, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric - Portrait of Edmond Maitre.jpeg|''Portrait of {{ill|Edmond Ma\u00eetre|fr}}'', 1869\nImage:Bazille_La_Toilette.jpg|''[[La Toilette (Bazille)|La Toilette]]'', 1870, [[Mus\u00e9e Fabre]]\n<!-- File:Frederic Bazille Paysage au bord du Lez.jpg|''Paysage au bord du Lez'', 1870, oil on canvas, [[Minneapolis Institute of Arts]] -->\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[A Studio at Les Batignolles]]''\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*Pitman, Dianne W.

Arguably, his most notable painting was ''[[Work (painting)|Work]]'' (1852\u20131865). Brown spent the latter years of his life painting the twelve works known as ''[[The Manchester Murals]]'', depicting [[History of Manchester|Mancunian history]], for [[Manchester Town Hall]].\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Rossetti-10.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Brown, at left, with [[William Holman Hunt]]. [[Caricature]] by [[Max Beerbohm]] from ''[[Rossetti and His Circle]]''.]]\nBrown was the grandson of the medical theorist [[John Brown (doctor)|John Brown]], founder of the [[Brunonian system of medicine]]. His great grandfather was a Scottish labourer.  His father Ford Brown served as a purser in the [[Royal Navy]], including a period serving under [[Sir Isaac Coffin, 1st Baronet|Sir Isaac Coffin]] and a period on [[HMS Arethusa (1781)|HMS ''Arethusa'']].  He left the Navy after the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]].\n\nIn 1818, Ford Brown married Caroline Madox, of an old Kentish family, from which his middle name was taken.<ref>\"Ford Madox Brown\", ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition|1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]''.</ref>  Brown's parents had limited financial resources, and they moved to [[Calais]] to seek cheaper lodgings, where their daughter Elizabeth Coffin was born in 1819 and their son Ford Madox Brown in 1821.\n\nBrown's education was limited, as the family frequently moved between lodgings in the [[Pas-de-Calais]] and relatives in [[Kent]], but he showed artistic talent in copying of old master prints.  His father initially sought a naval career for his son, writing to his former captain Sir Isaac Coffin.  The family moved to [[Bruges]] in 1835 so Brown could study at the academy under [[Albert Gregorius]].  Brown moved to [[Ghent]] in 1836 to continue his studies under [[Pieter van Hanselaere]].  He moved to [[Antwerp]] in 1837 to study under [[Gustaf Wappers]].  He continued to study in Antwerp after his mother's death in 1839.  His sister died in 1840, and then his father in 1842.\n\n==Works==\n{{see also|List of paintings by Ford Madox Brown}}\n[[File:Brown last of england.jpg|thumb|''[[The Last of England (painting)|The Last of England]]'' depicting an emigrating couple,  1855]]\nThe Tate Gallery holds an early example of Brown's work, a portrait of his father.<ref>[http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/brown-study-for-the-dean-in-the-execution-of-mary-queen-of-scots-n04280 Tate.org]</ref>  He first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1840, a work inspired by [[Lord Byron]]'s poem ''[[The Giaour]]'' (now lost) and then completed a version of ''The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots'', with his cousin and future wife Elisabeth Bromley as one of his models.  He lived in Montmartre with his new wife and aging father in 1841.  He painted ''[[Manfred on the Jungfrau (1842)|Manfred on the Jungfrau]]'', inspired by Lord Byron's poem ''[[Manfred]]'' while he was in Paris.\n\nIn 1843 he submitted work to the Westminster Cartoon Competition, for compositions to decorate the new [[Palace of Westminster]]. His entry, ''The Body of Harold Brought before William'', was not successful. His early works were, however, greatly admired by the young [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], who asked him to become his tutor. Through Rossetti, Brown came into contact with the artists who went on to form the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]]. Though closely linked to them, he was never actually a member of the brotherhood itself, but adopted the bright colours and realistic style of [[William Holman Hunt]] and [[John Everett Millais]].  He was also influenced by the works of Holbein that he saw in Basel in 1845, and by [[Friedrich Overbeck]] and [[Peter Cornelius]], whom he met in Rome in 1845-46.\n\nBrown struggled to make his mark in the 1850s, with his paintings failing to find buyers, and he considered emigrating to India.  In 1852 he started work on two of his most significant works.\n\nOne of his most famous images is ''[[The Last of England (painting)|The Last of England]]'', painted from 1852 to 1855, which was sold in March 1859 for 325 [[Guinea (British coin)|Guineas]]<ref>''Sale of Valuable Pictures'', ''[[The Times]]'', 28 March 1859</ref> (''2010: \u00a3{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|341.25|1859|2010|r=-2}}}}''). It depicts a pair of stricken emigrants as they sail away on the ship that will take them from England forever. It was inspired by the departure of the Pre-Raphaelite sculptor [[Thomas Woolner]], who had left for Australia. In an unusual [[Tondo (art)|tondo]] format, the painting is structured with Brown's characteristic linear energy, and emphasis on apparently grotesque and banal details, such as the cabbages hanging from the ship's side.  The husband and wife are portraits of Brown and his second wife Emma.\n\n[[File:Ford Madox Brown - The Coat of Many Colours - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Brown's ''Jacob and Joseph's Coat'' at [[Museo de Arte de Ponce]], [[Ponce, Puerto Rico]]]]\nBrown's most important painting was ''[[Work (painting)|Work]]'' (1852\u20131865), begun in Hampstead in 1852 and which he showed at his retrospective exhibition in 1865. [[Thomas Plint]] advanced funds to enable Brown to complete the work, in anticipation of obtaining the finished painting, but died in 1861 before the painting had been completed.<ref name=ODNB>Dianne Sachko Macleod, \u2018[[Thomas Plint|Plint, Thomas Edward]] (1823\u20131861)\u2019, ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, Sept 2004</ref> In this painting, Brown attempted to depict the totality of the mid-[[Victorian era|Victorian]] social experience in a single image, depicting 'navvies' digging up a road (Heath Street in Hampstead, London) and disrupting the old social hierarchies as they did so. The image erupts into proliferating details from the dynamic centre of the action, as the workers tear a hole in the road&nbsp;\u2013 and, symbolically, in the social fabric. Each character represents a particular social class and role in the modern urban environment. Brown wrote a catalogue to accompany the special exhibition of ''Work.'' This publication included an extensive explanation of ''Work'' that nevertheless leaves many questions unanswered. Brown's concern with the social issues addressed in ''Work'' prompted him to open a [[soup kitchen]] for Manchester's hungry, and to attempt to aid the city's unemployed to find work by founding a labour exchange.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/aug/31/pre-raphaelites-ybas?intcmp=239 |title=Why the pre-Raphaelites were the YBAs of their day |date=31 August 2012 |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |author=Fiona MacCarthy |accessdate=11 September 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.manchestergalleries.org/ford-madox-brown/background-to-the-painting/biography-of-ford-madox-brown/social-concience/ |title=Biography of Ford Madox Brown-Social conscience |year=2009 |publisher=Manchester Art Gallery |accessdate=11 September 2012 }}</ref>\n\nBrown found patrons in the north of England, including Plint, [[George Rae (art collector)|George Rae]] from Birkenhead,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.whistler.arts.gla.ac.uk/correspondence/people/biog/?bid=Rae_G&initial=R |website=[[University of Glasgow]] |title=George Rae, 1817-1902 |accessdate=24 June 2016}}</ref> [[John Miller (art collector)|John Miller]] from Liverpool, and [[James Leathart]] from Newcastle.  By the late 1850s he had lost patience with the poor reception he received at the Royal Academy and ceased to show his works there, rejecting an offer from Millais to support his becoming an associate member. He founded the [[Hogarth Club]] in 1858, with [[William Morris]], [[Edward Burne-Jones]], and his former pupil Rossetti. After a successful period of a few years, the club reached over 80 members, including several prominent members of the Royal Academy, but Brown resigned in 1860, and the club collapsed in 1861.\n\nFrom the 1860s, Brown also designed furniture and stained glass. He was a founder partner of [[William Morris]]'s design company, [[Morris, Marshall, Faulkner & Co.]], in 1861, which dissolved in 1874 with Morris continuing on his own. He was a close friend of the landscape artist [[Henry Mark Anthony]].\n\nBrown's major achievement after ''Work'' was ''[[The Manchester Murals]]'', a cycle of twelve paintings in the Great Hall of [[Manchester Town Hall]] depicting the history of the city. Brown would be 72 by the time he finished the murals. In total, he took six years perfecting the murals, which were his last major work.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Ford Madox Brown: pre-Raphaelite pioneer and working-class hero |last=Hughes |first=Kathryn |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/sep/16/ford-madox-brown-pre-raphaelite-exhibition |newspaper=The Guardian |date=16 September 2011 |accessdate=8 November 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Family==\n\n[[File:The Bromley Family.jpg|thumbnail|left|upright|''The Bromley Family''. Brown's first wife Elizabeth, lower right, 1844]]\n\nFord Madox Brown was married twice. His first wife Elizabeth Bromley was his first cousin, the daughter of his mother's sister Mary.  They were married in [[Meopham]] in Kent in April 1841, shortly before his 20th birthday and less than a year after the sudden death of his sister Elizabeth.   They lived in Montmartre in 1841 with Brown's invalid father who died the following summer.\n\nTheir first child died young as an infant in November 1842.  Their daughter [[Lucy Madox Brown|Emma Lucy]] was born in 1843 and the family moved back to England in 1844.  They travelled to Rome in 1845 to alleviate the illness of his wife, who was suffering from consumption (pulmonary tuberculosis).  She died in Paris in June 1846, aged 27, on the journey back to England from Rome.\n\nEmma Hill became a frequent model for Brown from 1848; for example, she is the wife in ''[[The Last of England (painting)|The Last of England]]''.  She became his mistress, and they shared a house in London, but social convention made him unable to marry an illiterate daughter of a bricklayer.  Their daughter [[Catherine Madox Brown|Catherine Emily]] was born in 1850, and eventually they were married at [[St Dunstan-in-the-West]] in April 1853.\n\nTheir son, '''Oliver Madox Brown''' (1855\u20131874) (known as Nolly) showed promise both as an artist and [[poet]], but died of [[blood poisoning]] before his maturity.  The death of Nolly was a crushing blow for Brown, and he kept a room for his son's belongings as a shrine.  Another son Arthur was born in September 1856.  Brown used Arthur as the model for the baby held by a ragged girl in the foreground of ''Work'', but he died aged only ten months old in July 1857.\n[[File:Ford Madox Brown - Pretty Baa-Lambs - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|''Pretty Baa-Lambs''. Brown's mistress and later wife Emma and second daughter Cathy in 1851]]\nHis daughters Lucy and Catherine were also competent artists.  Lucy married [[William Michael Rossetti]] in 1874.  Catherine, married [[Francis Hueffer]]; through Catherine, Brown was the grandfather of novelist [[Ford Madox Ford]] and great-grandfather of [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Home Secretary]] [[Frank Soskice]].\n\nBrown's second wife died in October 1890, and he died in Primrose Hill in 1893.

He was born and raised in [[Weston Favell]], then a small village near the English town of [[Northampton]], in which Crick's father and uncle ran the family's boot and shoe factory. His grandfather, [[Walter Drawbridge Crick]] (1857\u20131903), an amateur [[naturalist]], wrote a survey of local [[foraminifera]] (single-celled [[protist]]s with shells), corresponded with [[Charles Darwin]],<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Charles |last=Darwin |date=1882 |title=On the Dispersal of Freshwater Bivalves |journal=Nature |volume=25 |pages=529\u201330 |doi=10.1038/025529f0|bibcode = 1882Natur..25R.529D |issue=649}}</ref> and had two [[gastropod]]s (snails or slugs) named after him.\n\nAt an early age, Francis was attracted to science and what he could learn about it from books. As a child, he was taken to church by his parents. But by about age 12, he said he did not want to go anymore, as he preferred a scientific search for answers over religious belief.<ref name=\"CrickWMP\">[[#Crick1990|Crick (1990)]] p. 10: \"I remember telling my mother that I no longer wished to go to church\".</ref>\n\nWalter Crick, his uncle, lived in a small house on the south side of Abington Avenue; he had a shed at the bottom of his little garden where he taught Crick to blow glass, do chemical experiments and to make photographic prints. When he was eight or nine he transferred to the most junior form of the [[Northampton Grammar School]], on the Billing Road. This was about {{convert|1.25|mi|0|abbr=on}} from his home so he could walk there and back, by Park Avenue South and Abington Park Crescent, but he more often went by bus or, later, by bicycle. The teacher \u2013 a Miss Holding \u2013 was an inspired teacher and made everything interesting. The teaching in the higher forms was satisfactory, but not as stimulating. After the age of 14, he was educated at [[Mill Hill School]] in London (on scholarship), where he studied [[mathematics]], [[physics]], and [[chemistry]] with his best friend John Shilston. He shared the Walter Knox Prize for Chemistry on Mill Hill School's Foundation Day, Friday, 7 July 1933. He declared that his success was inspired by the quality of teaching he received whilst a pupil at Mill Hill.\n\nAt the age of 21, Crick earned a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in physics from [[University College, London]].<ref name=\"CrickWMPc1-2\">[[#Crick1990|Crick (1990)]] Chapters 1 and 2 provide Crick's description of his early life and education</ref> Crick had failed to gain a place at a Cambridge college, probably through failing their requirement for Latin.

This migration was made possible by the newly won influence of physicists such as [[John Randall (physicist)|Sir John Randall]], who had helped win the war with inventions such as [[radar]]. Crick had to adjust from the \"elegance and deep simplicity\" of physics to the \"elaborate chemical mechanisms that natural selection had evolved over billions of years.\" He described this transition as, \"almost as if one had to be born again.\" According to Crick, the experience of learning physics had taught him something important\u2014hubris\u2014and the conviction that since physics was already a success, great advances should also be possible in other sciences such as biology. Crick felt that this attitude encouraged him to be more daring than typical biologists who tended to concern themselves with the daunting problems of biology and not the past successes of physics{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}.\n\nFor the better part of two years, Crick worked on the physical properties of [[cytoplasm]] at Cambridge's [[Strangeways Research Laboratory]], headed by [[Honor Bridget Fell]], with a [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]] studentship, until he joined [[Max Perutz]] and [[John Kendrew]] at the [[Cavendish Laboratory]]. The Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge was under the general direction of [[William Lawrence Bragg|Sir Lawrence Bragg]], who had won the [[Nobel Prize]] in 1915 at the age of 25. Bragg was influential in the effort to beat a leading American chemist, [[Linus Pauling]], to the discovery of [[DNA]]'s structure (after having been pipped at the post by Pauling's success in determining the alpha helix structure of proteins). At the same time Bragg's Cavendish Laboratory was also effectively competing with [[King's College London]], whose Biophysics department was under the direction of Randall. (Randall had refused Crick's application to work at King's College.) Francis Crick and [[Maurice Wilkins]] of King's College were personal friends, which influenced subsequent scientific events as much as the close friendship between Crick and [[James Watson]]. Crick and Wilkins first met at King's College{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} and not, as erroneously recorded by two authors, at the [[Admiralty]] during World War II.\n\n==Personal life==\nCrick married twice, fathered three children and was the grandfather of six grandchildren; his brother Anthony (born in 1918) predeceased him in 1966.<ref>[[#Olby|Olby]], p. ix</ref>\n\nSpouses:\n* Ruth Doreen Crick, {{n\u00e9e}} Dodd (b. 1913, m. 18 February 1940 \u2013 8 May 1947. d. 2011), became Mrs. James Stewart Potter\n*[[Odile Crick]], {{n\u00e9e}} Speed (b. 11 August 1920, m. 14 August 1949 \u2013 28 July 2004, d. 5 July 2007)\n\nChildren:\n* Michael Francis Compton (b. 25 November 1940) [by Doreen Crick]\n* Gabrielle Anne (b. 15 July 1951) [by Odile Crick]\n* Jacqueline Marie-Therese [later Nichols] (b. 12 March 1954, d. 28 February 2011) [by Odile Crick];\n\nGrandchildren\n\n* Alexander (b.

Stimulated by their discussions with Wilkins and what Watson learned by attending a talk given by Franklin about her work on DNA, Crick and Watson produced and showed off an erroneous first model of DNA. Their hurry to produce a model of DNA structure was driven in part by the knowledge that they were competing against Linus Pauling.

Crick was writing his Ph.D. thesis; Watson also had other work such as trying to obtain crystals of [[myoglobin]] for X-ray diffraction experiments. In 1952, Watson performed X-ray diffraction on [[tobacco mosaic virus]] and found results indicating that it had helical structure. Having failed once, Watson and Crick were now somewhat reluctant to try again and for a while they were forbidden to make further efforts to find a molecular model of DNA.\n\n[[File:DNA Structure.jpg|thumb|right|Diagram that emphasizes the phosphate backbone of DNA. Watson and Crick first made helical models with the phosphates at the centre of the helices.]]\nOf great importance to the model building effort of Watson and Crick was Rosalind Franklin's understanding of basic chemistry, which indicated that the [[hydrophilic]] [[phosphate]]-containing backbones of the nucleotide chains of DNA should be positioned so as to interact with [[water (molecule)|water molecules]] on the outside of the molecule while the [[hydrophobic]] bases should be packed into the core. Franklin shared this chemical knowledge with Watson and Crick when she pointed out to them that their first model (from 1951, with the phosphates inside) was obviously wrong.\n\nCrick described what he saw as the failure of Wilkins and Franklin to cooperate and work towards finding a molecular model of DNA as a major reason why he and Watson eventually made a second attempt to do so. They asked for, and received, permission to do so from both William Lawrence Bragg and Wilkins. In order to construct their model of DNA, Watson and Crick made use of information from unpublished X-ray diffraction images of Franklin's (shown at meetings and freely shared by Wilkins), including preliminary accounts of Franklin's results/photographs of the X-ray images that were included in a written progress report for the King's College laboratory of Sir John Randall from late 1952.\n\nIt is a matter of debate whether Watson and Crick should have had access to Franklin's results without her knowledge or permission, and before she had a chance to [[academic publishing|formally publish]] the results of her detailed analysis of her X-ray diffraction data which were included in the progress report. However, Watson and Crick found fault in her steadfast assertion that, according to her data, a helical structure was not the only possible shape for DNA\u2014so they had a dilemma. In an effort to clarify this issue, Max Ferdinand Perutz later published what had been in the progress report,<ref>{{Cite journal|vauthors=Perutz MF, Randall JT, Thomson L, Wilkins MH, Watson JD |title=DNA helix |journal=Science |volume=164 |issue=3887 |pages=1537\u20139 |date=June 1969 |pmid=5796048 |doi=10.1126/science.164.3887.1537|bibcode = 1969Sci...164.1537W }}</ref> and suggested that nothing was in the report that Franklin herself had not said in her talk (attended by Watson) in late 1951. Further, Perutz explained that the report was to a Medical Research Council (MRC) committee that had been created in order to \"establish contact between the different groups of people working for the Council\". Randall's and Perutz's laboratories were both funded by the MRC.\n\nIt is also not clear how important Franklin's unpublished results from the progress report actually were for the model-building done by Watson and Crick. After the first crude X-ray diffraction images of DNA were collected in the 1930s, [[William Astbury]] had talked about stacks of nucleotides spaced at 3.4 angstr\u00f6m (0.34 nanometre) intervals in DNA. A citation to Astbury's earlier X-ray diffraction work was one of only eight references in Franklin's first paper on DNA.<ref>Franklin's citation to the earlier work of W. T.

Wilkins shared this information about the B form of DNA with Crick and Watson. Crick did not see Franklin's B form X-ray images ([[Photo 51]]) until after the DNA double helix model was published.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Crick F |title=The double helix: a personal view |journal=Nature |volume=248 |issue=5451 |pages=766\u20139 |date=1974|pmid=4599081 |doi=10.1038/248766a0|bibcode = 1974Natur.248..766C }}</ref>\n\nOne of the few references cited by Watson and Crick when they published their model of DNA was to a published article that included Sven Furberg's DNA model that had the bases on the inside. Thus, the Watson and Crick model was not the first \"bases in\" model to be proposed. Furberg's results had also provided the correct orientation of the DNA sugars with respect to the bases. During their model building, Crick and Watson learned that an [[antiparallel (biochemistry)|antiparallel]] orientation of the two nucleotide chain backbones worked best to orient the [[base pair]]s in the centre of a double helix. Crick's access to Franklin's progress report of late 1952 is what made Crick confident that DNA was a double helix with antiparallel chains, but there were other chains of reasoning and sources of information that also led to these conclusions.<ref name=\"JudsonCh3modeling\">In chapter 3 of ''The Eighth Day of Creation'', [[Horace Freeland Judson|Horace Judson]] describes the development of [[James Watson|Watson]]'s and Crick's thinking about the structure of DNA and how it evolved during their model building. Watson and Crick were open to the idea of tentatively ignoring all individual experimental results, in case they might be wrong or misleading. Judson describes how Watson spent a large amount of time ''ignoring'' Crick's belief (based on Franklin's determination of the space group) that the two backbone strands were antiparallel. On page 176, Judson quotes a letter written by Watson, \"The model has been derived almost entirely from stereochemical considerations with the only X-ray consideration being the spacing between the pair of bases 3.4 A which was originally found by Astbury.\"</ref>\n\nAs a result of leaving King's College for [[Birkbeck College]], Franklin was asked by John Randall to give up her work on DNA. When it became clear to Wilkins and the supervisors of Watson and Crick that Franklin was going to the new job, and that Linus Pauling was working on the structure of DNA, they were willing to share Franklin's data with Watson and Crick, in the hope that they could find a good model of DNA before Pauling was able. Franklin's X-ray diffraction data for DNA and her systematic analysis of DNA's structural features was useful to Watson and Crick in guiding them towards a correct molecular model. The key problem for Watson and Crick, which could not be resolved by the data from King's College, was to guess how the nucleotide bases pack into the core of the DNA double helix.\n\n[[File:DNA chemical structure.svg|thumb|right|Diagrammatic representation of some key structural features of DNA. The similar structures of [[guanine]]:[[cytosine]] and [[adenine]]:[[thymine]] base pairs is illustrated. The base pairs are held together by [[hydrogen bond]]s. The phosphate backbones are [[antiparallel (biochemistry)|anti-parallel]].]]\nAnother key to finding the correct structure of DNA was the so-called [[Chargaff's rules|Chargaff ratios]], experimentally determined ratios of the nucleotide subunits of DNA: the amount of [[guanine]] is equal to [[cytosine]] and the amount of [[adenine]] is equal to [[thymine]]. A visit by [[Erwin Chargaff]] to England, in 1952, reinforced the salience of this important fact for Watson and Crick.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} The significance of these ratios for the structure of DNA were not recognized until Watson, persisting in building structural models, realized that A:T and C:G pairs are structurally similar. In particular, the length of each base pair is the same. Chargaff had also pointed out to Watson that, in the aqueous, saline environment of the cell, the predominant tautomers of the pyrimidine (C and T) bases would be the amine and keto configurations of cytosine and thymine, rather than the imino and enol forms that Crick and Watson had assumed. They consulted [[Jerry Donohue]] who confirmed the most likely structures of the nucleotide bases.<ref>See Chapter 3 of ''The Eighth Day of Creation: Makers of the Revolution in Biology'' by Horace Freeland Judson published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press (1996) {{ISBN|0-87969-478-5}}. Judson also lists the publications of W. T. Astbury that described his early X-ray diffraction results for DNA.</ref> The base pairs are held together by [[hydrogen bond]]s, the same non-covalent interaction that stabilize the protein \u03b1-helix.  The correct structures were essential for the positioning of the hydrogen bonds.  These insights led Watson to deduce the true biological relationships of the A:T and C:G pairs. After the discovery of the hydrogen bonded A:T and C:G pairs, Watson and Crick soon had their anti-parallel, double helical model of DNA, with the hydrogen bonds at the core of the helix providing a way to \"unzip\" the two complementary strands for easy [[DNA replication|replication]]: the last key requirement for a likely model of the genetic molecule. As important as Crick's contributions to the discovery of the double helical DNA model were, he stated that without the chance to collaborate with Watson, he would not have found the structure by himself.<ref name=\"WMP75\">[[#Crick1990|Crick (1990)]] p. 75: \"If Jim had been killed by a tennis ball, I am reasonably sure I would not have solved the structure alone\".</ref>\n\nCrick did tentatively attempt to perform some experiments on nucleotide base pairing, but he was more of a theoretical biologist than an experimental biologist. There was another near-discovery of the base pairing rules in early 1952. Crick had started to think about interactions between the bases. He asked John Griffith to try to calculate attractive interactions between the DNA bases from chemical principles and [[quantum mechanics]]. Griffith's best guess was that A:T and G:C were attractive pairs. At that time, Crick was not aware of Chargaff's rules and he made little of Griffith's calculations, although it did start him thinking about complementary replication. Identification of the correct base-pairing rules (A-T, G-C) was achieved by Watson \"playing\" with cardboard cut-out models of the nucleotide bases, much in the manner that Linus Pauling had discovered the protein alpha helix a few years earlier. The Watson and Crick discovery of the DNA double helix structure was made possible by their willingness to combine theory, modelling and experimental results (albeit mostly done by others) to achieve their goal.\n\nThe DNA double helix structure proposed by Watson and Crick was based upon \"Watson-Crick\" bonds between the four bases most frequently found in DNA (A, C, T, G) and RNA (A, C, U, G). However, later research showed that triple-stranded, quadruple-stranded and other more complex DNA molecular structures required [[Hoogsteen base pair]]ing. The entire field of [[synthetic biology]] began with work by researchers such as [[Erik T. Kool]], in which bases other than A, C, T and G are used in a synthetic DNA. In addition to synthetic DNA there are also attempts to construct synthetic [[codons]], synthetic [[endonucleases]], synthetic proteins and synthetic [[zinc fingers]]. Using synthetic DNA, instead of there being 4<sup>3</sup> codons, if there are n new bases there could be as many as n<sup>3</sup> codons. Research is currently being done to see if codons can be expanded to more than 3 bases. These new codons can code for new amino acids. These synthetic molecules can be used not only in medicine, but in creation of new materials.<ref name=\"Simon, Matthew 2005\">Simon, Matthew (2005) ''Emergent Computation: emphasizing bioinformatics''.

It was clear to Crick that there had to be a code by which a short sequence of nucleotides would specify a particular [[amino acid]] in a newly synthesized protein. In 1956, Crick wrote an informal paper about the [[genetic code|genetic coding]] problem for the small group of scientists in Gamow's RNA group.<ref>\"[https://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/SC/B/B/G/F/_/scbbgf.pdf On Degenerate Templates and the Adaptor Hypothesis: A Note for the RNA Tie Club]\" by Francis Crick (1956).</ref> In this article, Crick reviewed the evidence supporting the idea that there was a common set of about 20 amino acids used to synthesize proteins. Crick proposed that there was a corresponding set of small \"adaptor molecules\" that would [[hydrogen bond]] to short sequences of a nucleic acid, and also link to one of the amino acids. He also explored the many theoretical possibilities by which short nucleic acid sequences might code for the 20 amino acids.\n\n[[File:3d tRNA.png|thumb|right|Molecular model of a [[tRNA]] molecule.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} Crick predicted that such adaptor molecules might exist as the links between [[codon]]s and [[amino acid]]s.]]\nDuring the mid-to-late 1950s Crick was very much intellectually engaged in sorting out the mystery of how proteins are synthesized. By 1958, Crick's thinking had matured and he could list in an orderly way all of the key features of the protein synthesis process:<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n*genetic information stored in the sequence of DNA molecules\n*a \"messenger\" RNA molecule to carry the instructions for making one protein to the cytoplasm\n*adaptor molecules (\"they might contain nucleotides\") to match short sequences of nucleotides in the RNA messenger molecules to specific amino acids\n*ribonucleic-protein complexes that catalyse the assembly of amino acids into proteins according to the messenger RNA\n\nThe adaptor molecules were eventually shown to be [[tRNA]]s and the catalytic \"ribonucleic-protein complexes\" became known as [[ribosome]]s. An important step was later realization (in 1960) that the [[messenger RNA]] was not the same as the [[ribosomal RNA]]. None of this, however, answered the fundamental theoretical question of the exact nature of the genetic code. In his 1958 article, Crick speculated, as had others, that a triplet of nucleotides could code for an amino acid. Such a code might be \"degenerate\", with 4\u00d74\u00d74=64 possible triplets of the four nucleotide subunits while there were only 20 amino acids. Some amino acids might have multiple triplet codes. Crick also explored other codes in which, for various reasons, only some of the triplets were used, \"magically\" producing just the 20 needed combinations.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hayes|first1=Brian|journal=American Scientist|date=1998|accessdate=11 January 2017|url=http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/the-invention-of-the-genetic-code|title=The Invention of the Genetic Code}}</ref> Experimental results were needed; theory alone could not decide the nature of the code. Crick also used the term \"[[central dogma of molecular biology|central dogma]]\" to summarize an idea that implies that genetic information flow between macromolecules would be essentially one-way:\n\n:'''DNA \u2192 RNA \u2192 Protein'''\n\nSome critics thought that by using the word \"dogma\", Crick was implying that this was a rule that could not be questioned, but all he really meant was that it was a compelling idea without much solid evidence to support it. In his thinking about the biological processes linking DNA genes to proteins, Crick made explicit the distinction between the materials involved, the energy required, and the information flow. Crick was focused on this third component (information) and it became the organizing principle of what became known as molecular biology. Crick had by this time become a highly influential theoretical molecular biologist.\n\nProof that the genetic code is a degenerate triplet code finally came from genetics experiments, some of which were performed by Crick.<ref>{{Cite journal|vauthors=Crick FH, Barnett L, Brenner S, Watts-Tobin RJ |title=General nature of the genetic code for proteins |journal=Nature |volume=192 |issue= 4809|pages=1227\u201332 |date=December 1961 |pmid=13882203 |doi= 10.1038/1921227a0|url=https://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/SC/B/C/B/J/_/scbcbj.pdf |format=PDF reprint|bibcode = 1961Natur.192.1227C }}</ref> The details of the code came mostly from work by [[Marshall Warren Nirenberg|Marshall Nirenberg]] and others who synthesized synthetic RNA molecules and used them as templates for ''[[in vitro]]'' protein synthesis.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Crick FH |title=The Croonian lecture, 1966.

Watson was present at a lecture, given in November 1951, where Franklin presented the two forms of the molecule, type A and type B, and discussed the position of the phosphate units on the external part of the molecule. She also specified the amount of water to be found in the molecule in accordance with other parts of it, data that have considerable importance in terms of the stability of the molecule. She was the first to discover and formulate these facts, which in fact constituted the basis for all later attempts to build a model of the molecule.  Before this, both Linus Pauling and Watson and Crick had generated erroneous models with the chains inside and the bases pointing outwards.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Schwartz, James (2008) [http://www.evolbiol.ru/large_files/darwin_dna.pdf  ''In Pursuit of the Gene.

Her identification of the [[space group]] for DNA crystals revealed to Crick that the DNA strands were [[antiparallel (biochemistry)|antiparallel]], which helped Watson and Crick decide to look for DNA models with two antiparallel polynucleotide strands.\n\nIn summary, Watson and Crick had three sources for Franklin's unpublished data: 1) her 1951 seminar, attended by Watson,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Cullen |first=Katherine E.|title=Biology: the people behind the science |date=2006 |publisher=[[Infobase Publishing|Chelsea House]] |location=New York |isbn=0-8160-5461-4 |page=136}}</ref> 2) discussions with Wilkins,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Cullen |first=Katherine E. |title=Biology: the people behind the science |date=2006 |publisher=[[Infobase Publishing|Chelsea House]] |location=New York |isbn=0-8160-5461-4 |page=140}}</ref> who worked in the same laboratory with Franklin, 3) a research progress report that was intended to promote coordination of Medical Research Council-supported laboratories.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Stocklmayer |first1=Susan M. |last2=Gore |first2=Michael M. |last3=Brtyant |first3=Chris |title=Science Communication in Theory and Practice |date=2001 |publisher=[[Wolters Kluwer|Kluwer Academic Publishers]] |isbn=1-4020-0131-2 |page=79}}</ref> Watson, Crick, Wilkins and Franklin all worked in MRC laboratories.\n\nCrick and Watson felt that they had benefited from collaborating with Wilkins. They offered him a co-authorship on the article that first described the double helix structure of DNA. Wilkins turned down the offer, a fact that may have led to the terse character of the acknowledgement of experimental work done at King's College in the eventual published paper. Rather than make any of the DNA researchers at King's College co-authors on the Watson and Crick double helix article, the solution that was arrived at was to publish two additional papers from King's College along with the helix paper.

While Franklin's experimental work proved important to Crick and Watson's development of a correct model, she herself could not realize it at the time.

We find ourselves through no wish of our own on this slowly revolving planet in an obscure corner of a vast universe.  Our questioning intelligence will not let us live in cow-like content with our lot.  We have a deep need to know why we are here.  What is the world made of?  More important, what are we made of?  In the past religion answered these questions, often in considerable detail.  Now we know that almost all these answers are highly likely to be nonsense, having sprung from man's ignorance and his enormous capacity for self-deception... The simple fables of the religions of the world have come to seem like tales told to children.  Even understood symbolically they are often perverse, if not rather unpleasant...

At what moment does a baby get a soul? Crick stated his view that the idea of a non-material soul that could enter a body and then persist after death is just that, an imagined idea. For Crick, the mind is a product of physical brain activity and the brain had evolved by natural means over millions of years. He felt that it was important that evolution by [[natural selection]] be taught in schools and that it was regrettable that English schools had compulsory religious instruction. He also considered that a new scientific world view was rapidly being established, and predicted that once the detailed workings of the brain were eventually revealed, erroneous [[Christianity|Christian]] concepts about the nature of humans and the world would no longer be tenable; traditional conceptions of the \"soul\" would be replaced by a new understanding of the physical basis of mind.

Crick speculated about possible stages by which an initially simple code with a few amino acid types might have evolved into the more complex code used by existing [[organism]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal|author=Crick FH |title=The origin of the genetic code |journal=Journal of Molecular Biology |volume=38 |issue=3 |pages=367\u201379 |date=December 1968 |pmid=4887876 |doi=10.1016/0022-2836(68)90392-6}}</ref> At that time, everyone thought of [[protein]]s as the only kind of [[enzyme]]s, and [[ribozyme]]s had not yet been found. Many molecular biologists were puzzled by the problem of the origin of a protein replicating system that is as complex as that which exists in organisms currently inhabiting [[Earth]]. In the early 1970s, Crick and Orgel further speculated about the possibility that the production of living systems from [[molecule]]s may have been a very rare event in the [[universe]], but once it had developed it could be spread by intelligent life forms using [[Spaceflight|space travel]] technology, a process they called \"[[directed panspermia]]\".<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/SC/B/C/C/P/_/scbccp.pdf |title=Directed Panspermia|author1=Crick, Francis  |author2=Orgel, Leslie E |journal=[[Icarus (journal)|Icarus]]|date=1973|volume =19 |pages =341\u2013346|doi=10.1016/0019-1035(73)90110-3|issue=3|bibcode = 1973Icar...19..341C }} Crick later wrote a book about directed panspermia: {{Cite book|author=Crick, Francis |title=Life itself: its origin and nature |publisher=Simon and Schuster |location=New York |date=1981|isbn=0-671-25562-2}}</ref> In a retrospective article,<ref name=\"CrickRetro\">{{Cite journal|vauthors=Orgel LE, Crick FH |title=Anticipating an RNA world.

It, however, requires a five base binding between the mRNA and tRNA with a flip of the anti-codon creating a triplet coding, even though it is a five-base physical interaction. [[Thomas H. Jukes]] pointed out that the code constraints on the mRNA sequence required for this translation mechanism is still preserved.<ref>{{Cite journal \n| doi = 10.1016/0006-291X(72)90031-9 \n| last1 = Jukes | first1 = T.

James Watson claimed at a Cambridge conference marking the 50th anniversary of the discovery of the structure of DNA in 2003:\n\n<blockquote>Now perhaps it's a pretty well kept secret that one of the most uninspiring acts of the University of Cambridge over this past century was to turn down Francis Crick when he applied to be the [[Arthur Balfour Professor of Genetics|Professor of Genetics]], in 1958. Now there may have been a series of arguments, which led them to reject Francis. It was really saying, don't push us to the frontier.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}</blockquote>\n\nThe apparently \"pretty well kept secret\" had already been recorded in Soraya De Chadarevian's ''Designs For Life: Molecular Biology After World War II'', published by [[Cambridge University Press]] in 2002. His major contribution to molecular biology in Cambridge is well documented in ''The History of the University of Cambridge: Volume 4 (1870 to 1990)'', which was published by CUP in 1992.\n\nAccording to the [[University of Cambridge]]'s genetics department official website, the electors of the professorship could not reach consensus, prompting the intervention of then University [[Vice-Chancellor]] [[Edgar Adrian, 1st Baron Adrian|Lord Adrian]]. Lord Adrian first offered the professorship to a compromise candidate, [[Guido Pontecorvo]], who refused, and is said to have offered it then to Crick, who also refused.\n\nIn 1976, Crick took a [[sabbatical|sabbatical year]] at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in [[La Jolla, California]]. Crick had been a nonresident fellow of the Institute since 1960. Crick wrote, \"I felt at home in Southern California.\"<ref name=\"CrickWMP145\">[[#Crick1990|Crick (1990)]] p. 145</ref> After the sabbatical, Crick left Cambridge in order to continue working at the Salk Institute. He was also an adjunct professor at the [[University of California, San Diego]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sns-crick-obit-story.html#|title=Co-discoverer of DNA's double helix dies|last=Mestel|first=Rosie|work=chicagotribune.com|access-date=2018-09-20|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Nobel Laureates |url=http://nobel.universityofcalifornia.edu/list.html |publisher=University of California}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/uchistory/general_history/overview/1960timeline.html|title=University of California History Digital Archives|website=www.lib.berkeley.edu|access-date=2018-09-20}}</ref> He taught himself [[neuroanatomy]] and studied many other areas of [[neuroscience]] research. It took him several years to disengage from molecular biology because exciting discoveries continued to be made, including the discovery of [[alternative splicing]] and the discovery of [[restriction enzyme]]s, which helped make possible [[genetic engineering]]. Eventually, in the 1980s, Crick was able to devote his full attention to his other interest, [[consciousness]]. His [[autobiography|autobiographical]] book, ''[[What Mad Pursuit: A Personal View of Scientific Discovery]]'', includes a description of why he left molecular biology and switched to neuroscience.\n\nUpon taking up work in theoretical neuroscience, Crick was struck by several things:\n*there were many isolated subdisciplines within neuroscience with little contact between them\n*many people who were interested in behaviour treated the brain as a [[black box (systems)|black box]]\n*consciousness was viewed as a [[taboo]] subject by many [[neurobiologist]]s\n\nCrick hoped he might aid progress in neuroscience by promoting constructive interactions between specialists from the many different subdisciplines concerned with consciousness. He even collaborated with [[neurophilosophy|neurophilosophers]] such as [[Patricia Churchland]]. In 1983, as a result of their studies of computer models of neural networks, Crick and Mitchison proposed that the function of [[REM sleep]] is to remove certain modes of interactions in networks of cells in the mammalian cerebral cortex; they called this hypothetical process '[[reverse learning]]' or 'unlearning'. In the final phase of his career, Crick established a collaboration with [[Christof Koch]] that lead to publication of a series of articles on consciousness during the period spanning from 1990<ref>\"[https://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/SC/B/C/F/D/_/scbcfd.pdf Towards a Neurobiological Theory of Consciousness]\" by Francis Crick and Christof Koch in ''Seminars in the Neurosciences'' (1990): Volume 2 pages 263\u2013275.</ref> to 2005. Crick made the strategic decision to focus his theoretical investigation of consciousness on how the brain generates visual [[awareness]] within a few hundred milliseconds of viewing a scene. Crick and Koch proposed that consciousness seems so mysterious because it involves very short-term [[memory]] processes that are as yet poorly understood. Crick also published a book describing how [[neurobiology]] had reached a mature enough stage so that consciousness could be the subject of a unified effort to study it at the molecular, cellular and behavioural levels. Crick's book ''[[The Astonishing Hypothesis]]'' made the argument that neuroscience now had the tools required to begin a scientific study of how [[Human brain|brain]]s produce conscious experiences. Crick was sceptical about the value of [[Connectionism|computational models]] of mental function that are not based on details about brain structure and function.\n\n==Awards and honours==\n[[File:Crick-stainedglass-gonville-caius.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Stained glass window in the dining hall of [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge|Caius College]], in Cambridge, commemorating Francis Crick and representing the double helical structure of [[B-DNA]].]]\n\nIn addition to his third share of the 1962 Nobel prize for Physiology or Medicine, he received many awards and honours, including the Royal and Copley medals of the Royal Society (1972 and 1975), and also the Order of Merit (on 27 November 1991); he refused an offer of a CBE in 1963,<ref>{{cite web|title=Cabinet Office list of honours declined by since deceased persons, 1951\u20131999 |url=http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/sites/default/files/resources/document2012-01-24-075439.pdf |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120404175744/http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/sites/default/files/resources/document2012%2D01%2D24%2D075439.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=4 April 2012 |accessdate=2 November 2016 |format=PDF }}</ref> but was often referred to in error as 'Sir Francis Crick' and even on occasions as 'Lord Crick.'

van Aerssen''' (27 September 1572 - 27 December 1641), from 1611 on lord of [[Sommelsdijk]], was a [[diplomacy|diplomat]] and statesman of the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]].\n\n==Biography==\nHe was born in [[Brussels]], the son of [[Cornelis van Aarsens]], also a statesman. His talents commended him to the notice of Advocate [[Johan van Oldenbarnevelt]], who sent him, at the age of 26 years, as a diplomatic agent of the states-general to the court of  [[France]].  He took a considerable part in the negotiations of the [[Twelve Years' Truce]] in 1609.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nHis conduct of affairs having displeased the French king, he was recalled from his post by Oldenbarneveldt in 1616.  Such was the hatred he henceforth conceived against his former benefactor, that he did his very utmost to effect Oldebarneveldt's ruin.  He was one of the packed court of judges who in 1619 condemned the aged statesman to death.  For his share in this judicial murder a deep stain rests on the memory of Aarssens.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nHe afterwards became the confidential counsellor of [[Maurice of Nassau|Maurice, Prince of Orange]], and afterwards of [[Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange]], in their conduct of the foreign affairs of the republic.  He was sent on special embassies to [[Venice]], [[Germany]] and [[England]], and displayed so much diplomatic skill and finesse that [[Cardinal Richelieu]] ranked him among the three greatest politicians of his time.  He died, aged 69, in [[The Hague]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{EB1911|wstitle=Aarssens, Francis van|volume=1}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.nationaalarchief.nl/webviews/page.webview?eadid=NL-HaNA_1.10.01&pageid=N10292 Van Aerssen family archive inventory]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n*{{Cite NIE|wstitle=Aarsens, Frans van|year=1905  |short=x}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Aarssens, Francis Van}}\n[[Category:1572 births]]\n[[Category:1641 deaths]]\n[[Category:Dutch diplomats]]\n[[Category:Dutch people of the Eighty Years' War (United Provinces)]]\n[[Category:Knights of the Order of Saint Michael]]\n[[Category:Politicians from Brussels]]", "sha1": "0v34hq0vl34gscnje9al61m177izs5w"}}, {"title": "Frigate", "ns": "0", "id": "11464", "revision": {"id": "865889366", "parentid": "864365901", "timestamp": "2018-10-26T20:53:42Z", "contributor": {"ip": "151.73.58.38"}, "comment": "/* Further developments */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{short description|Type of warship}}\n{{about|the warship|the bird|Frigatebird|the album by April Wine|Frigate (album)}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2018}}\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = vertical\n | header =\n | header_align = left/right/center\n | header_background =\n | footer_background =\n | width =\n | image1 = HMCS_Halifax_(FFH_330)_en_route_to_Haiti_2010-01-18.jpg\n | width1 = 280\n | caption1 = [[HMCS Halifax (FFH 330)|HMCS ''Halifax'']] of the [[Royal Canadian Navy]]\n | alt1 =\n | image2 = US_Navy_020612-N-9407M-518_British_frigate_HMS_Richmond_(F-239)_launches_an_AGM-84A_%5Eldquo,Harpoon%5Erdquo,_missile.jpg\n | width2 = 280\n | caption2 = [[HMS Richmond (F239)|HMS ''Richmond'']] of the [[Royal Navy]]\n | image3 = Admiral Gorshkov frigate 03.jpg\n | width3 = 280\n | caption3 = ''Admiral Sergei Gorshkov'' of the [[Russian Navy]]\n | =\n}}\n[[File:BADEN-WURTTEMBERG 00257 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|''Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg'', an [[F125-class frigate]] of the [[German Navy]]]]\n[[File:Forbin-090531-N-9988F-406.jpg|thumb|''Forbin'', an [[Horizon-class frigate]] of the [[French Navy]]]]\n\nA '''frigate''' {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|f|r|\u026a|\u0261|\u0259|t}} is a type of [[warship]], having various sizes and roles over the last few centuries.\n\nIn the 17th century, a frigate was any warship built for speed and maneuverability, the description often used being \"frigate-built\". These could be warships carrying their principal batteries of carriage-mounted [[Naval artillery|guns]] on a single [[deck (ship)|deck]] or on two decks (with further smaller carriage-mounted guns usually carried on the forecastle and quarterdeck of the vessel). The term was generally used for ships too small to stand in the [[line of battle]], although early line-of-battle ships were frequently referred to as frigates when they were built for speed.\n\nIn the 18th century, frigates were usually as long as a [[ship of the line]] and were [[square rig|square-rigged]] on all three masts ([[Full-rigged ship|full-rigged]]), but were faster and with lighter armament, used for patrolling and escort. In the definition adopted by the [[British Admiralty]], they were [[Rating system of the Royal Navy|rated ships]] of at least 28 guns, carrying their principal armaments upon a single continuous deck \u2014 the upper deck \u2014 while ships of the line possessed two or more continuous decks bearing batteries of guns.\n\nIn the late 19th century (beginning about 1858 with the construction of prototypes by the British and French navies), the '''armoured frigate''' was a type of [[ironclad warship]] that for a time was the most powerful type of vessel afloat. The term \"frigate\" was used because such ships still mounted their principal armaments on a single continuous upper deck.\n\nIn modern navies, frigates are used to protect other warships and [[merchant-marine]] ships, especially as [[anti-submarine warfare]] (ASW) combatants for amphibious expeditionary forces, underway replenishment groups, and merchant [[convoy]]s. Ship classes dubbed \"frigates\" have also more closely resembled [[corvette]]s, [[destroyer]]s, [[cruiser]]s and even battleships. Some European navies such as the French, German or Spanish ones use the term \"frigate\" for both their destroyers and frigates.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} The rank \"[[frigate captain]]\" derives from the name of this type of ship.\n\n==Age of sail==\n\n===Origins===\n[[File:Frc3a9gate-c3a0-la-voile1.jpg|thumb|Light frigate, circa 1675\u20131680]]\n\nThe term \"frigate\" (Italian: ''fregata''; Spanish/Catalan/Portuguese/Sicilian: ''fragata''; Dutch: ''fregat''; French: ''fr\u00e9gate'') originated in the [[Mediterranean]] in the late 15th century, referring to a lighter [[galleass]] type ship with oars, sails and a light armament, built for speed and maneuverability.<ref name=\"Henderson\">Henderson, James: ''Frigates Sloops & Brigs''. Pen & Sword Books, London, 2005. {{ISBN|1-84415-301-0}}.</ref>  The etymology of the word is unknown, although it may have originated as a [[corruption (linguistic)|corruption]] of ''[[Wikt:aphractus|aphractus]]'', a [[Latin]] word for an open vessel with no lower deck. ''Aphractus'' was, in turn, derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] phrase \u1f04\u03c6\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u03bd\u03b1\u1fe6\u03c2 (''aphraktos naus''), or \"undefended ship\".\n\nIn 1583, during the [[Eighty Years' War]], [[Habsburg Spain]] recovered the [[Southern Netherlands]] from the rebellious [[Dutch (ethnic group)|Dutch]]. This soon led to the occupied ports being used as bases for [[privateers]], the [[Dunkirker]]s, to attack the shipping of the Dutch and their allies. To achieve this they developed small, maneuverable, sailing vessels that came to be referred to as frigates.  The success of these Dunkirker vessels influenced the ship design of other navies contending with them but because most regular navies required ships of greater endurance than the Dunkirker frigates could provide, the term was soon applied less exclusively to any relatively fast and elegant sail-only war ship. In French, the term \"frigate\" became a verb, meaning 'to build long and low', and an adjective, adding more confusion. Even the huge English {{HMS|Sovereign of the Seas||2}} could be described as \"a delicate frigate\" by a contemporary after her upper decks were reduced in 1651.<ref>Rodger (2004) p. 216</ref>\n\nThe navy of the [[Dutch Republic]] was the first navy to build the larger ocean-going frigates. The Dutch navy had three principal tasks in the struggle against Spain: to protect Dutch merchant ships at sea, to blockade the ports of Spanish-held [[Flanders]] to damage trade and halt enemy [[privateering]], and to fight the Spanish fleet and prevent troop landings. The first two tasks required speed, shallowness of draft for the shallow waters around the Netherlands, and the ability to carry sufficient supplies to maintain a blockade. The third task required heavy armament, sufficient to fight against the Spanish fleet. The first of these larger battle-capable frigates were built around 1600 at [[Hoorn]] in [[County of Holland|Holland]].<ref>Geofrrey Parker, ''The Military Revolution: Military Innovation and the Rise of the West 1500\u20131800'', p. 99</ref> By the later stages of the [[Eighty Years' War]] the Dutch had switched entirely from the heavier ships still used by the English and Spanish to the lighter frigates, carrying around 40&nbsp;guns and weighing around 300&nbsp;tons.\n\nThe effectiveness of the Dutch frigates became most visible in the [[Battle of the Downs]] in 1639, encouraging most other navies, especially the English, to adopt similar designs.\n\nThe fleets built by the [[Commonwealth of England]] in the 1650s generally consisted of ships described as \"frigates\", the largest of which were two-decker 'great frigates' of the [[third rate]]. Carrying 60&nbsp;guns, these vessels were as big and capable as 'great ships' of the time; however, most other frigates at the time were used as '[[cruiser]]s': independent fast ships. The term \"frigate\" implied a long hull design, which relates directly to speed (see [[hull speed]]) and also, in turn, helped the development of the [[broadside]] tactic in naval warfare.\n\n[[File:La Boudeuse.jpg|thumb|{{Ship|French frigate|Boudeuse|1766|2}}, of [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]]]]\nAt this time, a further design evolved, reintroducing oars to create the galley frigate such as {{HMS|Charles Galley|1676|6}} of 1676 which was rated as a 32-gun fifth rate but also had a bank of 40 oars set below the upper deck which could be used to propel the ship in the absence of a favourable wind.\n\nIn Danish, the word \"fregat\" is often applied to warships carrying as few as 16 guns, such as {{HMS|Falcon|1802|6}} which the British classified as a sloop.\n\nUnder the [[rating system of the Royal Navy]], by the middle of the 18th century, the term \"frigate\" was technically restricted to single-decked ships of the [[fifth rate]], though small 28-gun frigates were classed as [[sixth rate]].<ref name=\"Henderson\"/>\n\n===Classic design===\n[[File:Lutine1.jpg|thumb|[[Magicienne-class frigate|A ''Magicienne''-class frigate]]]]\n[[File:Main batteries of M\u00e9duse-Garneray-IMG 4787-cropped.JPG|thumb|Gun deck of the {{sclass-|Pallas|frigate (1808)|0}} frigate {{ship|French frigate|M\u00e9duse|1810|2}}]]\n\nThe classic sailing frigate, well-known today for its role in the [[Napoleonic wars]], can be traced back to French developments in the second quarter of the 18th century. The French-built [[French frigate M\u00e9d\u00e9e (1741)|M\u00e9d\u00e9e]] of 1740 is often regarded as the first example of this type. These ships were square-rigged and carried all their main guns on a single continuous upper deck. The lower deck, known as the \"gun deck\", now carried no armament, and functioned as a \"berth deck\" where the crew lived, and was in fact placed below the waterline of the new frigates.<ref name=\"Breen\">{{cite journal |last=Breen |first=Colin |last2=Forsythe |first2=Wes |date=2007 |title=The French Shipwreck La Surveillante, Lost in Bantry Bay, Ireland, in 1797 |jstor=25617454|subscription=yes|journal=Historical Archaeology |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=41\u201342 }}</ref>\n\nA total of fifty-nine French sailing frigates were built between 1777 and 1790, with a standard design averaging a hull length of {{convert|135|ft|m|abbr=on}} and an average draught of {{convert|13|ft|m|abbr=on}}. The new frigates recorded sailing speeds of up to {{convert|14|kn|km/h mph}}, significantly faster than their predecessor vessels.<ref name=\"Breen\"/> When the seas were so rough that comparable two-deckers had to close the gun-ports on the lower decks, they were still able to fight with all their guns (see the [[Action of 13 January 1797]], for an example when this was decisive). Like the larger 74 which was developed at the same time, the new frigates sailed well and were good fighting vessels due to a combination of long hulls and low upperworks compared to vessels of comparable size and firepower.\n\nThe [[Royal Navy]] captured a handful of the new French frigates during the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] (1740\u20131748) and were impressed by them, particularly for their inshore handling capabilities. They soon built copies and started to adapt the type to their own needs, setting the standard for other frigates as the leading naval power. The first British frigates carried 28 guns including an upper deck battery of twenty-four 9-pounder guns (the remaining four smaller guns were carried on the quarter deck) but soon developed into fifth-rate ships of 32 or 36 guns including an upper deck battery of twenty-six 12-pounder guns, with the remaining six or ten smaller guns carried on the quarter deck and forecastle. From around 1778, a larger \"heavy\" frigate was developed with a main battery of twenty-six or twenty-eight 18-pounder guns (again with the remaining ten smaller guns carried on the quarter deck and forecastle).\n\nBoth British and American frigates could (and usually did) additionally carry smaller carriage-mounted guns on their quarter decks and [[forecastle]]s (the superstructures above the upper deck). Technically, rated ships with fewer than 28&nbsp;guns could not be classed as frigates but as \"[[post ship]]s\"; however, in common parlance most post ships were often described as \"frigates\", the same casual misuse of the term being extended to smaller two-decked ships that were too small to stand in the line of battle.\n\nRoyal Navy frigates of the late 18th century included the 1780-vintage ''Perseverance'' class, which measured around 900 [[Builder's Old Measurement|tons burthen]] and carried 36&nbsp;guns; this successful class was followed by numerous other classes that measured over 1,000 tons burthen and carried 38 guns.\n\n===Heavy frigates===\n[[File:USS_Constitution_gets_underway._(8961608386).jpg|thumb|{{USS|Constitution}}.]]\nIn 1797, three of the [[United States Navy]]'s [[original six frigates of the United States Navy|first six major ships]] were rated as 44-gun frigates (or \"super-frigates\"), which operationally carried fifty-six to sixty [[24-pounder long gun]]s and 32-pounder or 42-pounder [[carronade]]s on two decks; by all regards they were exceptionally powerful and tough. These ships were so well-armed that they were often regarded as equal to ships of the line, and after a series of losses at the outbreak of the [[War of 1812]], Royal Navy fighting instructions ordered British frigates (usually of 38 guns or less) to never engage American frigates at any less than a 2:1 advantage. {{USS|Constitution}}, preserved as a [[museum ship]] by the US Navy, is the oldest commissioned warship afloat, and is a surviving example of a frigate from the [[Age of Sail]]. ''Constitution'' and her sister ships {{USS|President|1800|2}} and {{USS|United States|1797|2}} were created in a response to deal with the Barbary Coast pirates and in conjunction with the [[Naval Act of 1794]]. The three big frigates, when built, had a distinctive building pattern which minimised \"[[Hogging and sagging|hogging]]\" (in which the centre of the keel rises while both ends drop) and improves hydrodynamic efficiency.<ref name=\"Archibald, Roger 1997\">Archibald, Roger. 1997. Six ships that shook the world. American Heritage of Invention & Technology 13, (2): 24.</ref>\n\nThe hull was designed so that all the weight from the guns was upon the keel itself. [[Joshua Humphreys]] proposed that only [[live oak]], a tree that grew only in America, should be used to build these ships. The method was to use diagonal riders, eight on each side that sat at a 45 degree angle. These beams of live oak were about {{convert|2|ft|cm}} wide and around {{convert|1|ft|cm}} thick and helped to maintain the shape of the hull, serving also to reduce flexibility and to minimize impacts.<ref name=\"Archibald, Roger 1997\"/> These ideas were considered revolutionary in the late 18th and early 19th century. A three-layer method was used in which the planks along the sides of the hull were laid horizontally across the [[Frame (nautical)|frames]], making a crossing or checker board pattern. The sides of the ship could be as thick as {{convert|25|in|cm}}, and were able to absorb substantial damage. The strength of this braced construction earned USS ''Constitution'' the nickname \"Old Ironsides\".{{fact|date=November 2017}}\n\n===Role===\n[[File:20000 Abraham Lincoln.jpg|right|upright=1.1|thumb|The fictitious, but representative, ironclad frigate USS ''Abraham Lincoln'', from [[Jules Verne]]'s novel ''[[Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea]]'']]\n\nFrigates were perhaps the hardest-worked of warship types during the [[Age of Sail]]. While smaller than a [[ship-of-the-line]], they were formidable opponents for the large numbers of [[sloop]]s and [[gunboat]]s, not to mention [[privateer]]s or merchantmen. Able to carry six months' stores, they had very long range; and vessels larger than frigates were considered too valuable to operate independently.\n\nFrigates scouted for the fleet, went on commerce-raiding missions and patrols, and conveyed messages and dignitaries. Usually, frigates would fight in small numbers or singly against other frigates. They would avoid contact with [[ships-of-the-line]]; even in the midst of a fleet engagement it was bad etiquette for a ship of the line to fire on an enemy frigate which had not fired first.<ref>{{cite book |last=Lavery |first=Brian |title=Nelson's Navy: The Ships, Men and Organisation 1793\u20131815 |year=1989 |publisher=Naval Institute Press |location=Annapolis |isbn=978-1-59114-611-7 |pages=49, 298\u2013300}}</ref> Frigates were involved in fleet battles, often as \"repeating frigates\". In the smoke and confusion of battle, [[Naval flag signalling|signals]] made by the fleet commander, whose [[flagship]] might be in the thick of the fighting, might be missed by the other ships of the fleet.<ref name=\"EB\">{{cite book |last=|title=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|volume=17|page=469}}</ref> Frigates were therefore stationed to windward or leeward of the main [[line of battle]], and had to maintain a clear line of sight to the commander's flagship. Signals from the flagship were then repeated by the frigates, which themselves standing out of the line and clear from the smoke and disorder of battle, could be more easily seen by the other ships of the fleet.<ref name=\"EB\"/> If damage or loss of masts prevented the flagship from making clear conventional signals, the repeating frigates could interpret them and hoist their own in the correct manner, passing on the commander's instructions clearly.<ref name=\"EB\"/>\n\nFor officers in the Royal Navy, a frigate was a desirable posting. Frigates often saw action, which meant a greater chance of glory, promotion, and [[prize money]].\n\nUnlike larger ships that were placed [[Reserve Fleet|in ordinary]], frigates were kept in service in peacetime as a cost-saving measure and to provide experience to frigate captains and officers which would be useful in wartime. Frigates could also carry [[marine (military)|marines]] for boarding enemy ships or for operations on shore; in 1832, the frigate {{USS|Potomac|1822|6}} landed a party of 282 sailors and Marines ashore in the US Navy's [[first Sumatran expedition]].\n\nCommon armament was one gundeck with 24\u201330 long guns, from 8- to 24-pounders (3.6 to 11&nbsp;kg), with up to a dozen light guns or [[carronade]]s on the quarterdeck and forecastle above.\n\nFrigates remained a crucial element of navies until the mid-19th century. The first [[ironclad]]s were classified as \"frigates\" because of the number of guns they carried. However, terminology changed as iron and steam became the norm, and the role of the frigate was assumed first by the [[protected cruiser]] and then by the [[light cruiser]].\n\nFrigates are often the vessel of choice in historical naval novels due to their relative freedom compared to ships of the line (kept for fleet actions) and smaller vessels (generally assigned to a home port and less widely ranging). For example, the [[Patrick O'Brian]] [[Aubrey\u2013Maturin series]], [[C. S. Forester]]'s [[Horatio Hornblower]] series and [[Douglas Reeman|Alexander Kent]]'s [[Richard Bolitho]] series. The motion picture ''[[Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World]]'' features a reconstructed historic frigate, [[HMS Surprise (replica ship)|HMS ''Rose'']], to depict Aubrey's frigate HMS ''Surprise''.\n\n==Age of steam==\n{{Main article|Steam frigate}}\n[[File:Lebreton engraving-26.jpg|thumb|French [[Paddle steamer|paddle]] frigate {{Ship|French frigate|Descartes||2}}]]\n\nVessels classed as frigates continued to play a great role in navies with the adoption of steam power in the 19th century. In the 1830s, navies experimented with large [[paddle steamer]]s equipped with large guns mounted on one deck, which were termed \"paddle frigates\".\n\nFrom the mid-1840s on, frigates which more closely resembled the traditional sailing frigate were built with steam engines and screw [[propeller]]s. These \"[[screw frigate]]s\", built first of wood and later of [[Wrought iron|iron]], continued to perform the traditional role of the frigate until late in the 19th century.\n\n===Armoured frigate===\nFrom 1859, armour was added to ships based on existing frigate and [[ship of the line]] designs. The additional weight of the armour on these first [[ironclad warship]]s meant that they could have only one gun deck, and they were technically frigates, even though they were more powerful than existing ships-of-the-line and occupied the same strategic role. The phrase \"armoured frigate\" remained in use for some time to denote a sail-equipped, broadside-firing type of ironclad.\n\nAfter 1875, the term \"frigate\" fell out of use. Vessels with armoured sides were designated as \"[[battleship]]s\" or \"[[Armored cruiser|armoured cruiser]]s\", while \"[[protected cruiser]]s\" only possessed an armoured deck, and unarmoured vessels, including frigates and sloops, were classified as \"unprotected cruisers\".\n\n==World War II==\n{{See also| List of frigates of the Second World War}}\n[[File:Lochmorlich.jpg|thumb|A [[Loch class frigate|Loch-class frigate]] ]]\n[[File:USS Gallup (PF-47).jpg|thumb|The U.S. Navy {{sclass-|Tacoma|frigate|0}} patrol frigate {{USS|Gallup|PF-47|6}} at [[San Pedro, California|San Pedro]], [[California]], on 30 May 1944]]\n\nModern frigates are related to earlier frigates only by name. The term \"frigate\" was readopted during the [[World War II|Second World War]] by the British [[Royal Navy]] to describe an [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine]] escort vessel that was larger than a [[corvette]], while smaller than a [[destroyer]]. Equal in size and capability to the American [[destroyer escort]], frigates are usually less expensive to build and maintain.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.military-today.com/navy/top_10_frigates.htm|title=Top 10 Frigates {{!}} Military-Today.com|last=ARG|website=www.military-today.com|access-date=2017-07-13}}</ref> Anti-submarine escorts had previously been classified as [[Sloop-of-war|sloop]]s by the Royal Navy, and the {{sclass-|Black Swan|sloop|2}}<nowiki/>s of 1939\u20131945 were as large as the new types of frigate, and more heavily armed. Twenty-two of these were reclassified as frigates after the war, as were the remaining 24 smaller {{sclass2-|Castle|corvette|2}}<nowiki/>s.\n\nThe frigate was introduced to remedy some of the shortcomings inherent in the [[Flower-class corvette|Flower-class]] corvette design: limited armament, a hull form not suited to open-ocean work, a single [[driveshaft|shaft]] which limited speed and manoeuvrability, and a lack of range. The frigate was designed and built to the same mercantile construction standards ([[scantling]]s) as the corvette, allowing manufacture by yards unused to warship construction. The first frigates of the {{sclass2-|River|frigate|4}} (1941) were essentially two sets of corvette machinery in one larger hull, armed with the latest [[Hedgehog (weapon)|Hedgehog]] anti-submarine weapon.\n\nThe frigate possessed less offensive firepower and speed than a [[destroyer]], but such qualities were not required for anti-submarine warfare. Submarines were slow while submerged, and [[ASDIC]] sets did not operate effectively at speeds of over {{convert|20|kn|mph km/h|lk=on}}. Rather, the frigate was an austere and weatherly vessel suitable for mass-construction and fitted with the latest innovations in anti-submarine warfare. As the frigate was intended purely for convoy duties, and not to deploy with the fleet, it had limited range and speed.\n\nThe contemporary [[Nazi Germany|German]] ''[[F-class escort ship|Flottenbegleiter]]'' (\"fleet escorts\"), also known as \"F-Boats\", were essentially frigates.<ref>[http://www.prinzeugen.com/FRIND.htm prinzeugen.com \"Frigate: An Online Photo Album\".] Retrieved on: 11 February 2008.</ref> They were based on a pre-war ''[[Oberkommando der Marine]]'' concept of vessels which could fill roles such as fast minesweeper, minelayer, merchant escort and anti-submarine vessel. Because of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] their displacement was officially limited to 600&nbsp;tons, although in reality they exceeded this by about 100&nbsp;tons. F-boats had two stacks and two 105&nbsp;mm gun turrets. The design was flawed because of its narrow beam, sharp bow and unreliable high pressure steam turbines. F-boats were succeeded in operational duties by [[Torpedo boat type 35|Type 35]] and [[Elbing class torpedo boat]]s. ''Flottenbegleiter'' remained in service as advanced training vessels.\n\nIt was not until the Royal Navy's {{sclass2-|Bay|frigate|4}} of 1944 that a British design classified as a \"frigate\" was produced for fleet use, although it still suffered from limited speed. These [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] frigates, built on incomplete {{sclass2-|Loch|frigate|2}} hulls, were similar to the [[United States Navy]]'s [[destroyer escort]]s (DE), although the latter had greater speed and offensive armament to better suit them to fleet deployments. The destroyer escort concept came from design studies by the [[General Board of the United States Navy]] in 1940, as modified by requirements established by a British commission in 1941<ref>Gardiner, Robert, ed., ''Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships, 1922\u20131946'', New York: Mayflower Books, 1980, {{ISBN|0-8317-0303-2}}, p. 149.</ref> prior to the American entry into the war, for deep-water escorts. The American-built destroyer escorts serving in the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Royal Navy]] were rated as [[Captain-class frigate|Captain-class]] frigates. The U.S. Navy's two [[Canada|Canadian]]-built {{sclass-|Asheville|frigate|0}} and 96 British-influenced, American-built {{sclass-|Tacoma|frigate|0}} frigates that followed originally were classified as \"patrol [[gunboat]]s\" (PG) in the U.S. Navy but on 15 April 1943 were all reclassified as '''patrol frigates (PF)'''.\n\n==Contemporary==\n\n===Guided-missile role===\n[[File:HMCS Regina (FFH 334) Frigate.jpg|thumb|right|[[Royal Canadian Navy]] {{sclass-|Halifax|frigate|2}} {{HMCS|Regina|FFH 334|6}} escorting the American aircraft carrier {{USS|Kitty Hawk|CV-63|6}} across the Pacific Ocean in 2008]]\n[[File:Chilean frigate Almirante Lynch.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Ecuadorian Navy]] {{sclass-|Leander|frigate|2}} BAE ''Mor\u00e1n Valverde'', formerly the [[Chilean Navy]]'s {{ship|Chilean frigate|Almirante Lynch|PFG-07|2}}]]\n[[File:USS Leahy (CG-16) at sea off San Diego, in May 1978.jpg|thumb|right|{{USS|Leahy|DLG-16|6}} departing [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], California, in May 1978. She was classified as a guided-missile frigate (DLG-16) until 1975, when she was reclassified as a [[guided-missile cruiser]] (CG-16).]]\n\nThe introduction of the [[surface-to-air missile]] after World War II made relatively small ships effective for anti-aircraft warfare: the \"guided missile frigate.\" <!-- removing this sentence, it does not conform to the NPOV, and in any case it is incorrect. \"Designed as cost-efficient surface combatants, they lack the multi-mission capability necessary for modern surface combatants faced with multiple, high-technology threats and offer limited capacity for growth\" --> In the USN, these vessels were called \"[[ocean escort]]s\" and [[hull classification symbol|designated]] \"DE\" or \"DEG\" until 1975 \u2013 a holdover from the World War II [[destroyer escort]] or \"DE\". The [[Royal Canadian Navy]] and British [[Royal Navy]] maintained the use of the term \"frigate\"; likewise, the French Navy refers to missile-equipped ship, up to cruiser-sized ships ({{sclass-|Suffren|frigate|5}}, {{sclass-|Tourville|frigate|5}}, and {{sclass-|Horizon|frigate|4}}es), by the name of \"fr\u00e9gate\", while smaller units are named ''[[aviso]]''. The Soviet Navy used the term \"guard-ship\" (''\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u043a\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043b\u044c'').\n\nFrom the 1950s to the 1970s, the [[United States Navy]] commissioned ships classed as guided missile frigates ([[hull classification symbol]] DLG or DLGN, literally meaning guided missile [[destroyer leader]]s), which were actually anti-aircraft warfare [[cruiser]]s built on [[destroyer]]-style hulls. These had one or two twin launchers per ship for the [[RIM-2 Terrier]] missile, upgraded to the [[RIM-67 Standard]] ER missile in the 1980s. This type of ship was intended primarily to defend aircraft carriers against anti-ship [[cruise missile]]s, augmenting and eventually replacing converted World War II cruisers (CAG/CLG/CG) in this role. The guided missile frigates also had an anti-submarine capability that most of the World War II cruiser conversions lacked. Some of these ships \u2014 {{USS|Bainbridge|CGN-25|2}} and {{USS|Truxtun|CGN-35|2}} along with the {{sclass-|California|cruiser|5}} and {{sclass-|Virginia|cruiser|4}}es \u2014 were [[United States naval reactors|nuclear-powered]] (DLGN).<ref>Bauer and Roberts, pp. 215\u2013217</ref> These \"frigates\" were roughly mid-way in size between cruisers and destroyers. This was similar to the use of the term \"frigate\" during the age of sail during which it referred to a medium-sized warship, but it was inconsistent with conventions used by other contemporary navies which regarded frigates as being smaller than destroyers. During the [[United States Navy 1975 ship reclassification|1975 ship reclassification]], the large American frigates were redesignated as guided missile cruisers or destroyers (CG/CGN/DDG), while [[ocean escort]]s (the American classification for ships smaller than destroyers, with hull symbol DE/DEG ([[destroyer escort]])) were reclassified as frigates (FF/FFG), sometimes incorrectly called \"fast frigates\". In the late 1970s the [[US Navy]] introduced the 51-ship [[Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigate|''Oliver Hazard Perry''-class]] guided missile frigates (FFG), the last of which was decommissioned in 2015, although some serve in other navies.<ref>Bauer and Roberts, pp. 251\u2013252</ref> By 1995 the older guided missile cruisers and destroyers were replaced by the {{sclass-|Ticonderoga|cruiser|1}}s and {{sclass-|Arleigh Burke|destroyer|1}}s.<ref>Gardiner and Chumbley, pp. 580\u2013585</ref>\n\nOne of the most successful post-1945 designs was the British {{sclass-|Leander|frigate|2}}, which was used by several navies. Laid down in 1959, the ''Leander''-class was based on the previous [[Whitby-class frigate|Type 12 anti-submarine frigate]] but equipped for anti-aircraft use as well. They were used by the UK into the 1990s, at which point some were sold onto other navies. The ''Leander'' design, or improved versions of it, were licence-built for other navies as well.\n\nNearly all modern frigates are equipped with some form of offensive or defensive missiles, and as such are rated as guided-missile frigates (FFG). Improvements in surface-to-air missiles (e.g., the [[Eurosam]] [[MBDA Aster|Aster 15]]) allow modern guided-missile frigates to form the core of many modern navies and to be used as a fleet defence platform, without the need for specialised anti-air warfare frigates.\n\n===Other uses===\nThe Royal Navy [[Salisbury-class frigate|Type 61 ''Salisbury'' class]] were [[radar picket|\"air direction\"]] frigates equipped to track aircraft. To this end they had reduced armament compared to the [[Leopard-class frigate|Type 41 ''Leopard''-class]] air-defence frigates built on the same hull.\n\nMulti-role frigates like the [[MEKO 200]], {{sclass-|Anzac|frigate|5}} and {{sclass-|Halifax|frigate|4}}es are designed for navies needing warships deployed in a variety of situations that a general frigate class would not be able to fulfill and not requiring the need for deploying [[destroyer]]s.\n\n===Anti-submarine role===\n[[File:HMS Somerset (F82).jpg|thumb|right|{{HMS|Somerset|F82|6}} of the [[Royal Navy]]. [[Type 23 frigate]]s were built for [[anti-submarine warfare]] but are capable multi-purpose ships.<ref>http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/operations-and-support/surface-fleet/type-23-frigates/ Type 23 frigates at the Royal Navy website</ref>]]\n\nAt the opposite end of the spectrum, some frigates are specialised for [[anti-submarine warfare]]. Increasing submarine speeds towards the end of World War II (see [[German Type XXI submarine]]) greatly reduced the margin of speed superiority of frigate over submarine. The frigate could no longer be slow and powered by mercantile machinery and consequently postwar frigates, such as the [[Type 12 frigate|''Whitby'' class]], were faster.\n\nSuch ships carry improved [[sonar]] equipment, such as the [[Sonar#Anti-submarine warfare|variable depth sonar]] or [[towed array sonar|towed array]], and specialised weapons such as [[torpedo]]es, forward-throwing weapons such as [[Limbo (weapon)|Limbo]] and missile-carried anti-submarine torpedoes such as [[ASROC]] or [[Ikara (missile)|Ikara]]. Surface-to-air missiles such as [[AIM-7 Sparrow#Sea Sparrow|Sea Sparrow]] and surface-to-surface missiles such as [[Exocet]] give them defensive and offensive capabilities. The Royal Navy's original [[Type 22 frigate]] is an example of a specialised anti-submarine warfare frigate.\n\nEspecially for anti-submarine warfare, most modern frigates have a [[Helipad|landing deck]] and [[hangar]] aft to operate [[helicopter]]s, eliminating the need for the frigate to close with unknown sub-surface threats, and using fast helicopters to attack nuclear submarines which may be faster than surface warships. For this task the helicopter is equipped with sensors such as [[sonobuoy]]s, wire-mounted dipping sonar and [[magnetic anomaly detector]]s to identify possible threats, and torpedoes or [[depth-charge]]s to attack them.\n\nWith their onboard radar helicopters can also be used to reconnoitre over-the-horizon targets and, if equipped with [[anti-ship missile]]s such as [[Penguin missile|Penguin]] or [[Sea Skua]], to attack them. The helicopter is also invaluable for [[search and rescue]] operation and has largely replaced the use of [[dinghy|small boats]] or the [[Underway replenishment|jackstay rig]] for such duties as transferring personnel, mail and cargo between ships or to shore. With helicopters these tasks can be accomplished faster and less dangerously, and without the need for the frigate to slow down or change course.\n\n===Airdefense role===\n[[File:HNLMS De Zeven Provinci\u00ebn (F 802).jpg|thumb|<nowiki>[[HNLMS De Zeven Provinci\u00ebn (F802)]]</nowiki>]]\nSome frigates are specialised in [[airdefense]], because of the major developments in [[fighter jet|fighter jets]] and [[ballistic missile|ballistic missiles]].\nAn example is the [[De Zeven Provinci\u00ebn-class frigate|De Zeven Provinci\u00ebn-class]] Airdefense- and commandfrigate of the [[Royal Dutch Navy]]. These ships are armed with [[RIM-66 Standard|VL Standard Missile 2 Block IIIA]], one or two [[Goalkeeper CIWS]] systems, ([[HNLMS Evertsen (F805)|''HNLMS Evertsen'']] has two Goalkeepers, the rest of the ships have the capacity for another one.) [[RIM-162 ESSM|VL Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile]]s, a special [[SMART-L|SMART-L Radar]] and a [[Active Phased Array Radar|Thales APAR]], all of whom are for airdefense. Another example is the [[Iver Huitfeldt-class frigate|Iver Huitfeldtclass]] of the [[Danish Navy]]. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://marineschepen.nl/schepen/zeprov.html#specs|title=De Zeven Provinci\u00ebn classe (LCF)|publisher=Jaime Karreman}}</ref>\n\n===Further developments===\n[[File:Shivalik Maiden Sortie.jpg|thumb|The stealthy {{sclass-|Shivalik|frigate|2}} of the Indian Navy]]\n[[File:FS_Surcouf.jpg|thumb|The stealthy {{sclass-|La Fayette|frigate|4}} of the French Navy that introduced the Stealth Technology in the early 1990s]]\n\n[[Stealth technology]] has been introduced in modern frigate design by the French {{sclass-|La Fayette|frigate|4}} design.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.militaryfactory.com/ships/frigates.asp|title=Navy Frigate Warships|access-date=2017-07-13|language=en-US}}</ref> Frigate shapes are designed to offer a minimal [[radar cross section]], which also lends them good air penetration; the maneuverability of these frigates has been compared to that of sailing ships. Examples are the Italy and French {{sclass-|Horizon|frigate|4}} with the [[Aster 15]] and [[Aster 30]] missile for anti-missile capabilities, the [[Germany|German]] {{sclass2-|F125|frigate|5}} and {{sclass-|Sachsen|frigate|2}}<nowiki/>s, the [[Turkey|Turkish]] {{sclass2-|TF2000|frigate|5}} type frigates with the [[MK-41 VLS]], and the [[India]]n {{sclass-|Shivalik| frigate|5}} and {{sclass-|Talwar|frigate|4}}es with the [[Brahmos missile]] system.\n\nThe modern [[French Navy]] applies the term first-class frigate and second-class frigate to both destroyers and frigates in service. Pennant numbers remain divided between F-series numbers for those ships internationally recognised as frigates and D-series pennant numbers for those more traditionally recognised as destroyers. This can result in some confusion as certain classes are referred to as frigates in French service while similar ships in other navies are referred to as destroyers. This also results in some recent classes of French ships such as the {{sclass-|Horizon|frigate|4}} being among the largest in the world to carry the rating of frigate.\n\nIn the [[German Navy]], frigates were used to replace aging destroyers; however in size and role the new German frigates exceed the former class of destroyers. The future German [[F125-class frigate]] will be the largest class of frigates worldwide with a displacement of more than 7,200&nbsp;tons. The same was done in the [[Spanish Navy]], which went ahead with the deployment of the first [[Aegis combat system|Aegis]] frigates, the {{sclass-|\u00c1lvaro de Baz\u00e1n|frigate|2}}s.\n\n===Littoral combat ship (LCS)===\n[[File:USS Independence LCS-2 at pierce (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|{{USS|Independence|LCS-2|6}}, an {{sclass-|Independence|littoral combat ship}} of the United States Navy]]\n\nSome new classes of ships similar to [[corvette]]s are optimized for high-speed deployment and combat with small craft rather than combat between equal opponents; an example is the U.S. [[littoral combat ship]] (LCS). As of 2015, all {{sclass-|Oliver Hazard Perry|frigate|2}}<nowiki/>s in the United States Navy have been decommissioned, and their role partially being assumed by the new LCS. While the LCS class ships are smaller than the frigate class they will replace, they offer a similar degree of weaponry while requiring less than half the crew complement and offering a top speed of over {{convert|40|kn}}. A major advantage for the LCS ships is that they are designed around specific mission modules allowing them to fulfill a variety of roles. The modular system also allows for most upgrades to be performed ashore and installed later into the ship, keeping the ships available for deployment for the maximum time.\n\nThe latest U.S. deactivation plans means that this is the first time that the U.S. Navy has been without a frigate class of ships since 1943 (technically {{USS|Constitution}} is rated as a frigate and is still in commission, but does not count towards Navy force levels).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.militarytimes.com/article/20140702/NEWS04/307020082/Decommissioning-plan-pulls-all-frigates-from-fleet-by-end-FY-15 |title=Decommissioning plan pulls all frigates from fleet by end of FY '15 |last=Larter |first=David |work=Militarytimes.com |date=2 July 2014 |accessdate=25 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe remaining 20 LCSs to be acquired from 2019 and onwards that will be enhanced will be designated as frigates, and existing ships given modifications may also have their classification changed to ''FF'' as well.<ref>[http://news.usni.org/2015/01/15/sna-modified-littoral-combat-ship-class-changed-fast-frigate SNA: Modified Littoral Combat Ships to be Designated Frigates] \u2013 News.USNI.org, 15 January 2015</ref>\n\n==Frigates in preservation==\n\nA few nations have frigates on display as museum ships.

With the [[Spanish general election, 1936|1936 elections]], the conservative [[Spanish Confederation of Autonomous Right-wing Groups]] lost by a narrow margin, and the leftist [[Popular Front (Spain)|Popular Front]] came to power. Intending to overthrow the republic, Franco followed other generals in launching a [[Spanish coup of July 1936|coup]] that failed to take control of most of the country and precipitated the [[Spanish Civil War]]. With the death of the other generals, Franco quickly became [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|his faction]]'s only leader. Franco gained military support from various authoritarian regimes and groups, especially [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Fascist Italy (1922\u201343)|Fascist Italy]], while the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republican side]] was supported by Spanish [[communists]] and [[anarchists]] as well as the [[Soviet Union]], [[Mexico]], and the [[International Brigades]]. In 1939, Franco won the war, which claimed half a million lives. He established a [[Francoist Spain|military dictatorship]]. Franco proclaimed himself Head of State and Government under the title ''El [[caudillo]]''. In April 1937, Franco merged the [[fascist]] and traditionalist political parties in the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|rebel zone]] ([[FE de las JONS]] and Traditionalist Communion),{{Sfn|Jerez Mir|Luque|2014|pp=177-178}} as well as other [[CEDA|conservative]] and [[Renovaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola|monarchist]] elements, into [[FET y de las JONS]]. At the same time he outlawed all other political parties, and thus Spain became a [[one-party state]].\n\nUpon his rise to power, Franco implemented policies [[White Terror (Spain)|that repressed political opponents and dissenters]], as many as 400,000 of whom died<ref>Sinova, J.

His parents married in 1890. The young Franco spent much of his childhood with his two brothers, [[Nicol\u00e1s Franco (politician)|Nicol\u00e1s]] (Ferrol, 1891\u20131977) and [[Ram\u00f3n Franco|Ram\u00f3n]], and his two sisters, Mar\u00eda del Pilar (Ferrol, 1894 \u2013 [[Madrid]], 1989), and Mar\u00eda de la Paz (Ferrol, 1899 \u2013 Ferrol, 1903). The latter died in infancy. [[Nicol\u00e1s Franco (politician)|Nicol\u00e1s]] was later a [[Spanish Navy|naval]] [[officer (armed forces)|officer]] and diplomat who in time married Mar\u00eda Isabel Pascual del Pobil y Ravello. [[Ram\u00f3n Franco|Ram\u00f3n]] was a pioneer [[aviator]], a [[Freemason]] with originally [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] political leanings who was killed in an [[air accident]] on a military mission in 1938.

Not needing any more officers, the Naval Academy admitted no new entrants from 1906 to 1913. To his father's chagrin, Francisco decided to try the [[Spanish Army]]. In 1907, he entered the Infantry Academy in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], graduating in July 1910 as second lieutenant (251st out of 312 cadets).{{Sfn|Jensen|2005|pp=13\u201314}} At 19, Franco was promoted to the rank of first lieutenant in June 1912.{{Sfn|Jensen|2005|p=28}}<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/49386039|title=Franco : a concise biography|last=Ashford.|first=Hodges, Gabrielle|date=2002|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=0312282850|edition=1st U.S.|location=New York|oclc=49386039}}</ref> Two years later, he obtained a commission to Morocco. Spanish efforts to occupy their new African [[protectorate]] provoked the protracted [[Rif War (1909)|Rif War]] (from 1909 to 1927) with native Moroccans. Their tactics resulted in heavy losses among Spanish [[officer (armed forces)|military officers]], and also provided an opportunity to earn promotion through merit. It was said that officers would receive either ''la caja o la faja'' (a coffin or a general's sash). Franco quickly gained a reputation as a good officer. [[File:Francisco y Ram\u00f3n Franco 1925.jpg|thumb|left|Francisco and his brother Ram\u00f3n in [[Spanish protectorate in Morocco|North Africa]], 1925]] In 1913, Franco transferred into the newly formed [[regulares]]: Moroccan colonial troops with Spanish officers, who acted as [[shock troops]]. This transfer into a perilous role may have been decided because Franco failed to win the hand of his first love, [[Sof\u00eda Subir\u00e1n]]. (The letters between the two were found and she was questioned by journalists.)\n\nIn 1916, aged 23 and already a captain, he was shot by enemy machine gun fire. He was badly wounded in the abdomen, specifically the liver, in a skirmish at ''El Biutz'' and possibly [[monorchism|lost a testicle]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8055329.stm |title=Spain's Franco 'had one testicle' |publisher=BBC News |date=18 May 2009 |accessdate=2 March 2010}}</ref> The physicians of the battle later concluded that his intestines were spared because he inhaled the moment he was shot. His survival marked him permanently in the eyes of the native troops as a man of ''[[Barakah|baraka]]'' (good luck). He was recommended for Spain's highest honour for gallantry, the coveted ''[[Laureate Cross of Saint Ferdinand|Cruz Laureada de San Fernando]]'', but instead received the ''Cross of Maria Cristina, First Class''. With that he was promoted to major at the end of February 1917 at age 24. This made him the youngest major in the Spanish army. From 1917 to 1920, he served in Spain. In 1920, Lieutenant Colonel [[Jos\u00e9 Mill\u00e1n Astray]], a [[wikt:histrionic|histrionic]] but charismatic officer, founded the [[Spanish Foreign Legion]], on similar lines to the [[French Foreign Legion]]. Franco became the Legion's second-in-command and returned to Africa. On 24 July 1921, the poorly commanded and overextended Spanish Army suffered [[Battle of Annual|a crushing defeat]] at [[Annual (Morocco)|Annual]] from [[Rif]] tribesmen led by the [[Muhammad Ibn 'Abd al-Karim al-Khattabi|Abd el-Krim]] brothers. The Legion and supporting units relieved the Spanish enclave of [[Melilla]] after a three-day forced march led by Franco. In 1923, by now a [[lieutenant colonel]], he was made commander of the Legion.\n\nOn 22 October 1923, Franco married [[Carmen Polo|Mar\u00eda del Carmen Polo y Mart\u00ednez-Vald\u00e8s]] (11 June 1900 \u2013 6 February 1988).<ref>https://sites.jmu.edu/spanishcivilwar/carmenpolo/</ref> Three years later the couple had a daughter, [[Carmen Franco y Polo|Mar\u00eda del Carmen]].<ref>[http://www.thepeerage.com/p11214.htm#i112139 Carmen Franco y Polo, 1st Duquesa de Franco]. thePeerage.com.

Promoted to [[colonel]], Franco led the first wave of troops ashore at [[Al Hoceima]] in 1925. This landing in the heartland of Abd el-Krim's tribe, combined with the French invasion from the south, spelled the beginning of the end for the short-lived [[Republic of the Rif]]. Franco's recognition eventually caught up with him and he was promoted to brigadier general on 3 February 1926. This made him the youngest general in Spain, and perhaps the youngest general of Europe. In 1928 Franco was appointed director of the newly created General Military Academy of Zaragoza, a new college for all army [[cadet]]s, replacing the former separate institutions for young men seeking to become officers in infantry, cavalry, artillery, and other branches of the army. Franco was removed as Director of the Zaragoza Military Academy in 1931; about 95% of his former Zaragoza cadets later came to side with him in the Civil War.\n\n=== During the Second Spanish Republic ===\nWith the fall of the monarchy in 1931, Franco did not take any notable stand.

Franco stressed in his speech the Republic's need for discipline and respect. For six months Franco was without a post and under surveillance.\n\nFranco was a subscriber to the journal of [[Acci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola]], a monarchist organisation, and a firm believer in the Jewish-Masonic-Bolshevik conspiracy or ''contubernio'' (filthy cohabitation)\u2014'one of Franco's favourite words': a conspiracy in which Jews, Freemasons, Communists, and other leftists alike allegedly sought the destruction of Christian Europe, with Spain the principal target.<ref>Preston, Paul (2010) \"The Theorists of Extermination\", essay in ''Unearthing Franco's Legacy'', pp. 42, 45.

Franco avoided involvement in [[Jos\u00e9 Sanjurjo]]'s attempted coup that year, and even wrote a hostile letter to Sanjurjo expressing his anger over the attempt. As a side result of Aza\u00f1a's military reform, in January 1933, Franco was relegated from the first to the 24th in the list of brigadiers; the same year, on 17 February, he was given the military command of the [[Balearic Islands]]: a post above his rank, but Franco was still angered that he was purposely stuck in the positions he didn't want to be. Yet it was quite common for the Conservative Officers to be moved or demoted.\n\nNew elections held in October 1933 resulted in a centre-right majority. In opposition to this government, a [[Anarchism in Spain#Prelude to revolution|revolutionary communist/anarchist movement]] broke out on 5 October 1934. This uprising was rapidly quelled in most of the country, but gained a stronghold in [[Asturias]], with the support of the [[miner]]s' unions. Franco, already General of Division and aide to the war minister, [[Diego Hidalgo y Dur\u00e1n|Diego Hidalgo]], was put in command of the operations directed to suppress the insurgency. Troops of the Spanish [[Army of Africa (Spain)|Army of Africa]] carried this out, with General [[Eduardo L\u00f3pez Ochoa]] as commander in the field. After two weeks of heavy fighting (and a death toll estimated between 1,200 and 2,000), the rebellion was suppressed.\n\nThe insurgency in Asturias (see [[Asturian miners' strike of 1934]]) sharpened the antagonism between Left and Right. Franco and L\u00f3pez Ochoa (who, prior to the campaign in Asturias, had been seen as a left-leaning officer)<ref>[[#Preston|Preston]], p. 103</ref> emerged as officers prepared to use 'troops against Spanish civilians as if they were a foreign enemy'.<ref>Preston, Paul (2010) \"The Theorists of Extermination\", essay in ''Unearthing Franco's Legacy'', p. 61. University of Notre Dame Press, {{ISBN|0-268-03268-8}}</ref> Franco described the rebellion to a journalist in [[Oviedo]] as, 'a frontier war and its fronts are socialism, communism and whatever attacks civilisation in order to replace it with barbarism.' Though the colonial units sent to the north by the government at Franco's recommendation<ref>[[#Thomas|Thomas]], p. 132</ref> consisted of the [[Spanish Foreign Legion]] and the Moroccan [[Regulares|Regulares Indigenas]], the right wing press portrayed the Asturian rebels as lackeys of a foreign Jewish-Bolshevik conspiracy.<ref>Balfour, Sebastian (2002).

Some time after these events, Franco was briefly commander-in-chief of the Army of Africa (from 15 February onwards), and from 19 May 1935, on, Chief of the General [[staff (military)|Staff]].\n\n==== 1936 general election ====\n{{main|Spanish general election, 1936}}\nAfter the ruling centre-right coalition collapsed amid the [[Straperlo]] corruption scandal, new elections were scheduled. Two wide coalitions formed: the [[Popular Front (Spain)|Popular Front]] on the left, ranging from [[Republican Union (Spain, 1934)|Republican Union]] to [[Communist Party of Spain|Communists]], and the Frente Nacional on the right, ranging from the centre [[radicalism (historical)|radicals]] to the conservative [[Carlism|Carlists]]. On 16 February 1936, the left won by a narrow margin.<ref>\"Riots Sweep Spain on Left's Victory; Jails Are Stormed\", ''The New York Times'', 18 February 1936.</ref> Growing political bitterness surfaced again. The government and its supporters, the Popular Front, had launched a campaign against the Opposition whom they accused of plotting against the Republic. According to the right-wing opposition, the real enemies of the Republic were not on the Right but on the Left; Spain was in imminent danger of falling under a \"Communist dictatorship\", and therefore by fighting the democratically elected Popular Front, they were merely doing their duty in defence of law and order and of the freedom and the fundamental rights of the Spanish people.<ref>[[Malcolm Muggeridge|Muggeridge, Malcolm]], editor, ''Ciano's Diplomatic Papers'', Odhams, London, 1948: 17\u201318</ref>\n\nOn 23 February Franco was sent to the [[Canary Islands]] to serve as the islands' military commander, an appointment perceived by him as a ''destierro'' (banishment).<ref>[[#Preston|Preston]], p. 120</ref> Meanwhile, a conspiracy led by [[Emilio Mola]] was taking shape.

On 23 June 1936, he wrote to the head of the government, [[Casares Quiroga]], offering to quell the discontent in the [[Spanish Republican Army]], but received no reply. The other rebels were determined to go ahead ''con Paquito o sin Paquito'' (with ''Paquito'' or without ''Paquito''; ''Paquito'' being a diminutive of ''Paco'', which in turn is short for ''Francisco''), as it was put by [[Jos\u00e9 Sanjurjo]], the honorary leader of the military uprising. After various postponements, 18 July was fixed as the date of the uprising. The situation reached a point of no return and, as presented to Franco by Mola, the coup was unavoidable and he had to choose a side. He decided to join the rebels and was given the task of commanding the [[Army of Africa (Spain)|Army of Africa]].

Despite the [[Non-Intervention Agreement]] of August 1936, the war was marked by [[Foreign involvement in the Spanish Civil War|foreign intervention]] on behalf of both sides, leading to international repercussions. The nationalist side was supported by [[Kingdom of Italy (1861\u20131946)#Fascism|Fascist Italy]], which sent the ''[[Corpo Truppe Volontarie]]'', and later by [[Nazi Germany]], which assisted with the [[Condor Legion]]. They were opposed by the [[Soviet Union]] and communist, socialists and anarchists within Spain. The United Kingdom and [[French Third Republic|France]] strictly adhered to the arms embargo,{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} provoking dissensions within the [[Popular Front (France)|French Popular Front]] coalition led by [[L\u00e9on Blum]], but the Republican side was nonetheless supported by the Soviet Union and volunteers fighting in the [[International Brigades]] (see for example [[Ken Loach]]'s ''[[Land and Freedom]]'').\n\nBecause [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Joseph Stalin]] used the war as a testing ground for modern warfare, some historians, such as [[Ernst Nolte]], have considered the Spanish Civil War, along with World War II, part of a [[European Civil War]] lasting from 1936 to 1945 and characterised mainly as a [[left-wing politics|left]]/[[right-wing politics|right]] ideological conflict. This interpretation has not found acceptance among most historians, who consider the Spanish Civil War and Second World War to be two distinct conflicts. Among other things, they point to the political heterogeneity on both sides (''See [[Spanish Civil War#Other factions|Spanish Civil War: other factions]]'') and criticise a monolithic interpretation, which overlooks the local nuances of [[History of Spain|Spanish history]].\n\n=== The first months ===\nFollowing 18 July 1936 ''[[pronunciamiento]]'', Franco assumed the leadership of the 30,000 soldiers of the [[Spanish Army of Africa]]. The first days of the insurgency were marked with a serious need to secure control over the [[Spanish Morocco|Spanish Moroccan Protectorate]]. On one side, Franco had to win the support of the natives and their (nominal) authorities, and, on the other, had to ensure his control over the army. His method was the summary execution of some 200 senior officers loyal to the Republic (one of them his own cousin). His loyal bodyguard was shot by Manuel Blanco.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.memoriahistocheeserica.org/alojados/periquete/paginas/noticias1.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170129081724/http://memoriahistocheeserica.org/alojados/periquete/paginas/noticias1.html | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 29 January 2017 | title = La Memoria de los Nuestros | language = Spanish | accessdate = 21 July 2006 }}</ref> Franco's first problem was how to move his troops to the [[Iberian Peninsula]], since most units of the Navy had remained in control of the Republic and were blocking the [[Strait of Gibraltar]]. He requested help from [[Benito Mussolini]], who responded with an unconditional offer of arms and planes; in Germany [[Wilhelm Canaris]], the head of the ''[[Abwehr]]'' military intelligence, persuaded Hitler to support the Nationalists. From 20 July onward Franco was able, with a small group of 22 mainly German [[Junkers Ju 52]] aircraft, to initiate an [[Airbridge (logistics)|air bridge]] to [[Seville]], where his troops helped to ensure the rebel control of the city. Through representatives, he started to negotiate with the United Kingdom, Germany, and Italy for more military support, and above all for more aircraft. Negotiations were successful with the last two on 25 July and aircraft began to arrive in [[Tetouan]] on 2 August. On 5 August Franco was able to break the blockade with the newly arrived air support, successfully deploying a ship convoy with some 2,000 soldiers.\n\nIn early August, the situation in western [[Andalusia]] was stable enough to allow him to organise a column (some 15,000 men at its height), under the command of then Lieutenant-Colonel [[Juan Yag\u00fce]], which would march through [[Extremadura]] towards Madrid. On 11 August [[Battle of M\u00e9rida|M\u00e9rida was taken]], and on 15 August [[Battle of Badajoz (1936)|Badajoz]], thus joining both nationalist-controlled areas. Additionally, Mussolini ordered a voluntary army, the ''[[Corpo Truppe Volontarie]]'' (CTV) of some 12,000 Italians of fully motorised units to Seville and Hitler added to them a professional squadron from the [[Luftwaffe]] (2JG/88) with about 24 planes. All these planes had the Nationalist Spanish insignia painted on them, but were flown by Italian and German nationals. The backbone of Franco's aviation in those days were the Italian [[SM.79]] and [[SM.81]] bombers, the biplane Fiat [[CR.32]] fighter and the German [[Junkers Ju 52]] cargo-bomber and the [[Heinkel He 51]] biplane fighter.\n\nOn 21 September, with the head of the column at the town of [[Maqueda]] (some 80&nbsp;km away from Madrid), Franco ordered a detour to free the [[Siege of the Alc\u00e1zar|besieged garrison at the Alc\u00e1zar]] of [[Toledo (Spain)|Toledo]], which was achieved on 27 September. This controversial decision gave the [[Popular Front (Spain)|Popular Front]] time to strengthen its defenses in Madrid and hold the city that year, but the holding of Alc\u00e1zar was an important morale and propaganda success for the Nationalists.\n\n=== Rise to power ===\nThe designated leader of the uprising, General [[Jos\u00e9 Sanjurjo]], died on 20 July 1936, in a plane crash. Therefore, in the nationalist zone, \"Political life ceased.\"<ref>[[#Thomas|Thomas]], p. 258</ref> Initially, only military command mattered; this was divided into regional commands ([[Emilio Mola]] in the North, [[Gonzalo Queipo de Llano]] in [[Seville]] commanding [[Andalusia]], Franco with an independent command and [[Miguel Cabanellas]] in [[Zaragoza]] commanding [[Aragon]]). The Spanish Army of Morocco itself was split into two columns, one commanded by General [[Juan Yag\u00fce]] and the other commanded by Colonel [[Jos\u00e9 Enrique Varela|Jos\u00e9 Varela]].\n\nFrom 24 July a coordinating ''[[Military junta|junta]]'' was established, based at [[Burgos]]. Nominally led by Cabanellas, as the most senior general,<ref>[[#Thomas|Thomas]], p. 282: \"to pacify, rather than to dignify, him.\"</ref> it initially included Mola, three other generals, and two colonels; Franco was later added in early August.<ref>[[#Thomas|Thomas]], p. 282</ref> On 21 September it was decided that Franco was to be commander-in-chief (this unified command was opposed only by Cabanellas),<ref>[[#Thomas|Thomas]], p. 421</ref> and, after some discussion, with no more than a lukewarm agreement from Queipo de Llano and from Mola, also head of government.<ref>[[#Thomas|Thomas]], pp. 423\u2013424</ref> He was, doubtlessly, helped to this primacy by the fact that, in late July, Hitler had decided that all of Germany's aid to the nationalists would go to Franco.<ref>[[#Thomas|Thomas]], p. 356</ref>\n\nMola had been somewhat discredited as the main planner of the attempted coup that had now degenerated into a civil war, and was strongly identified with the [[Carlism|Carlist]] monarchists and not at all with the [[Falange]], a party with Fascist leanings and connections (\"phalanx\", a far-right Spanish political party founded by [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Primo de Rivera]]), nor did he have good relations with Germany; Queipo de Llano and Cabanellas had both previously rebelled against the dictatorship of [[General]] [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]] and were therefore discredited in some nationalist circles; and Falangist leader Jos\u00e9 Antonio Primo de Rivera was in prison in [[Alicante]] (he would be executed a few months later) and the desire to keep a place open for him prevented any other Falangist leader from emerging as a possible head of state. Franco's previous aloofness from politics meant that he had few active enemies in any of the factions that needed to be placated, and also he had cooperated in recent months with both Germany and Italy.<ref>[[#Thomas|Thomas]], pp. 420\u2013422.</ref>\n\nOn 1 October 1936, in [[Burgos]], Franco was publicly proclaimed as ''[[Generalissimo|General\u00edsimo]]'' of the National army and ''Jefe del Estado'' ([[Head of State]]).<ref name=Thomas424>[[#Thomas|Thomas]], p. 424.</ref> When Mola was killed in another air accident a year later (which some believe was an assassination) (2 June 1937), no military leader was left from those who organised the conspiracy against the Republic between 1933 and 1935.<ref>[[#Thomas|Thomas]], pp. 689\u2013690.</ref>\n\n=== Military command ===\n[[File:J mmue 202444 1 00001.jpg|thumb|Franco and other rebel commanders during the Civil War, {{circa|1936\u20131939}}]]\nFranco personally guided military operations from this time until the end of the war. After the [[Siege of Madrid|failed assault on Madrid]] in November 1936, Franco settled on a piecemeal approach to winning the war, rather than bold maneuvering. As with his decision to [[Siege of the Alc\u00e1zar|relieve the garrison]] at Toledo, this approach has been subject of some debate; some of his decisions, such as in June 1938 when he preferred to head for [[Valencia (autonomous community)|Valencia]] instead of [[Catalonia]], remain particularly controversial from a military viewpoint. Valencia, Castellon and Alicante saw the last Republican troops defeated by Franco.\n\nAlthough both Germany and Italy provided military support to Franco, the degree of influence of both powers on his direction of the war seems to have been very limited. Nevertheless, the Italian troops, despite [[Battle of Guadalajara|not being always effective]], were present in most of the large operations in large numbers, while the German aircraft helped the Nationalist air force dominate the skies for most of the war. The Portuguese dictator [[Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar|Salazar]] also openly assisted the Nationalists from the start, contributing with 20,000 troops.\n\nFranco's direction of the German and Italian forces was limited, particularly in the direction of the [[Condor Legion]], but he was by default their supreme commander, and they rarely made decisions on their own. For reasons of prestige it was decided to continue assisting Franco until the end of the war, and Italian and German troops paraded on the day of the final victory in Madrid.<ref name=jackson/>\n\n=== Political command ===\n{{falangism sidebar}}\n\nThe Nazis were disappointed with Franco's resistance to installing fascism. Historian James S. Corum states: \n:As an ardent Nazi, [Ambassador Wilhelm] Faupel disliked Catholicism as well as the Spanish upper classes, and encouraged the working-class extremist members of the Falange to build a fascist party. Faupel devoted long audiences with Franco to convincing him of the necessity of remolding the Falange in the image of the Nazi Party. Faupel's interference in internal Spanish politics ran counter to Franco's policy of building a nationalist coalition of businessmen, monarchists and conservative Catholics, as well as Falangists.<ref>James S. Corum, \"The Luftwaffe and the coalition air war in Spain,\n1936\u20131939,\" ''Journal of Strategic Studies,'' (1995) 18:1, 68-90 quotation at p. 75.</ref> \nHistorian Robert H. Whealey provides more detail:\n:Whereas Franco's crusade was a counterrevolution, the arrogant Faupel associated the Falange with the \"revolutionary\" doctrines of National Socialism. He sought to provide Spain's poor with an alternative to \"Jewish internationalist Marxist-Leninism.\".... The old fashioned Alfonsists and Carlists who surrounded Franco viewed the Falangists as classless troublemakers.<ref>{{cite book|author=Robert H. Whealey|title=Hitler And Spain: The Nazi Role in the Spanish Civil War, 1936-1939|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Do4fBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA64|year=2015|page=64}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1937 to 1948 the Franco regime was a hybrid as Franco fused the ideologically incompatible national-syndicalist [[Falange]] (\"Phalanx\", a fascist Spanish political party founded by [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Primo de Rivera]]) and the [[Carlism|Carlist]] monarchist parties into [[one-party state|one party]] under his rule, dubbed ''[[Falange Espa\u00f1ola Tradicionalista y de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional-Sindicalista]]'' (FET y de las JONS), which became the only legal party in 1939. Unlike some other fascist movements, the Falangists had developed an official program in 1934, the \"Twenty-Seven Points\".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Payne|first=Stanley G.|year=1961|title=Falange: A History of Spanish Fascism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zOieAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA69#v=onepage&q&f=false|pages=68\u201369|isbn=9780804700580}}</ref> In 1937, Franco assumed as the tentative doctrine of his regime 26 out of the original 27 points.<ref>[[#Payne1999|Payne (1999)]], p. 269</ref> Franco made himself ''jefe nacional'' (National Chief) of the new FET (''Falange Espa\u00f1ola Tradicionalista''; Traditionalist Spanish Phalanx) with a secretary, Junta Political and National Council to be named subsequently by himself. Five days later (24 April) the raised-arm salute of the Falange was made the official salute of the Nationalist regime.<ref>[[#Payne1987|Payne (1987)]], p. 172</ref> In 1939 the personalist style heavily predominated, with ritualistic invocations of \"Franco, Franco, Franco.\"<ref>[[#Payne1987|Payne (1987)]], p. 234</ref> The Falangists' hymn, ''[[Cara al Sol]]'', became the semi-national anthem of Franco's not-yet-established regime.\n\nThis new political formation appeased the pro-German Falangists while tempering them with the anti-German Carlists. Franco's brother-in-law [[Ram\u00f3n Serrano S\u00fa\u00f1er]], who was his main political advisor, was able to turn the various parties under Franco against each other to absorb a series of political confrontations against Franco himself. Franco expelled the original leading members of both the Carlists ([[Manuel Fal Cond\u00e9]]) and the Falangists ([[Manuel Hedilla]]) to secure his political future. Franco also appeased the Carlists by exploiting the Republicans' [[anti-clericalism]] in his propaganda, in particular concerning the \"[[Martyrs of the Spanish Civil War|Martyrs of the war]]\". While the loyalist forces presented the war as a struggle to defend the Republic against Fascism, Franco depicted himself as the defender of \"Catholic Spain\" against \"atheist Communism.\"\n\n=== The end of the Civil War ===\nBy early 1939 only Madrid (see [[History of Madrid]]) and a few other areas remained under control of the government forces. On 27 February [[Neville Chamberlain|Chamberlain's Britain]] and [[\u00c9douard Daladier|Daladier's France]] officially recognised the Franco regime. On 28 March 1939, with the help of pro-Franco forces inside the city (the \"[[fifth column]]\" General Mola had mentioned in propaganda broadcasts in 1936), Madrid fell to the Nationalists. The next day, [[Valencia]], which had held out under the guns of the Nationalists for close to two years, also surrendered. Victory was proclaimed on 1 April 1939, when the last of the Republican forces surrendered. On the same day, Franco placed his sword upon the altar of a church and in a vow, promised that he would never again take up his sword unless Spain itself was threatened with invasion.\n\nAccording to [[Paul Preston]], 150,000 wartime civilian executions took place in the Francoist area, as well as 50,000 in the Republican area, in addition to 20,000 civilians executed by the Franco regime after the end of the war.<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1080/14623528.2014.878120|title=Paul Preston, The Spanish holocaust: inquisition and extermination in twentieth-century Spain (London: Harper Collins, 2012)|first1=Helen|last1=Graham|author-link1=Helen Graham (historian)|first2=Jo|last2=Labanyi|first3=Jorge|last3=Marco|first4=Paul|last4=Preston|first5=Michael|last5=Richards|pages=141\u2013144|journal=Journal of Genocide Research|volume=16|year=2014}}</ref>{{efn|The 150.000 executions put the amount of killings for political reasons over more than ten times bigger than those in Nazi Germany and 1000 times bigger than those of Fascist Italy.

Some historians argue that Franco made demands he knew Hitler would not accede to in order to stay out of the war.

This gesture was largely done to appease the monarchists in the ''[[Movimiento Nacional]]'' ([[Carlism|Carlists]] and [[Legitimism|Alfonsists]]). Franco left the throne vacant until 1969, proclaiming himself as a ''de facto'' [[regent]] for life. At the same time, Franco appropriated many of the privileges of a king. He wore the uniform of a [[Captain General]] (a rank traditionally reserved for the King) and resided in [[Royal Palace of El Pardo|El Pardo Palace]]. In addition he began walking under a [[baldachin|canopy]], and his portrait appeared on most [[Spanish coins]] and postage stamps. He also added \"[[by the grace of God]]\", a phrase usually part of the styles of monarchs, to his style.\n\nFranco initially sought support from various groups.

Estimation is difficult and controversial, [[#The end of the Civil War|but the number of people killed probably lies somewhere between 15,000 and 50,000]].\n\nBy the start of the 1950s Franco's state had become less violent, but during his entire rule, non-government trade unions and all political opponents across the [[political spectrum]], from [[communist]] and [[anarchism|anarchist]] organisations to [[liberal democracy|liberal democrats]] and [[Catalan nationalism|Catalan]] or [[Basque nationalism|Basque]] separatists, were either suppressed or tightly controlled by all means, up to and including violent police repression. The ''[[Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo]]'' (CNT) and the ''[[Uni\u00f3n General de Trabajadores]]'' (UGT) trade unions were outlawed, and replaced in 1940 by the corporatist ''[[Sindicato Vertical]]''. The [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] and the ''[[Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya]]'' (ERC) were banned in 1939, while the [[Communist Party of Spain]] (PCE) went underground. The [[Basque Nationalist Party]] (PNV) went into exile, and in 1959 the [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] armed group was created to wage a [[low-intensity warfare|low-intensity war]] against Franco.\n\nFranco's Spanish nationalism promoted a unitary national identity by repressing Spain's cultural diversity.

Franco's view of Spanish tradition was somewhat artificial and arbitrary: while some regional traditions were suppressed, [[Flamenco]], an [[Andalusia]]n tradition, was considered part of a larger, national identity. All cultural activities were subject to censorship, and many, such as the [[Sardana]], the national dance of [[Catalonia|Catalunya]], were plainly forbidden (often in an erratic manner). This cultural policy was relaxed over time, most notably during the late 1960s and early 1970s.\n\nFranco also used [[Language politics in Spain under Franco|language politics]] in an attempt to establish national homogeneity. He promoted the use of [[Castilian Spanish]] and suppressed other languages such as [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Galician language|Galician]], and [[Basque language|Basque]]. The legal usage of languages other than Castilian was forbidden. All government, notarial, legal and commercial documents were to be drawn up exclusively in Castilian and any documents written in other languages were deemed null and void. The usage of any other language was forbidden in schools, in advertising, and on road and shop signs. For unofficial use, citizens continued to speak these languages. This was the situation throughout the 1940s and to a lesser extent during the 1950s, but after 1960 the non-Castilian Spanish languages were freely spoken and written, and they reached bookshops and stages, although they never received official status.\n\nOn the other hand, the [[Catholic Church]] was upheld as the [[established church]] of the Spanish State, and it regained many of the traditional privileges it had lost under the Republic. Civil servants had to be Catholic, and some official jobs even required a \"good behavior\" statement by a priest. Civil marriages which had taken place in Republican Spain were declared null and void unless they had been confirmed by the Catholic Church. [[Divorce]] was forbidden, along with [[Birth control|contraceptives]] and [[abortion]].\n\nMost country towns and rural areas were patrolled by pairs of ''[[Guardia Civil (Spain)|Guardia Civil]]'', a military police for civilians, which functioned as Franco's chief means of social control. Larger cities and capitals were mostly under the [[Policia Armada]], or the ''[[grises]]'' (\"greys\", due to the colour of their uniforms) as they were called.\n\nStudent revolts at universities in the late 1960s and early 1970s were violently repressed by the heavily armed ''Polic\u00eda Armada'' (Armed Police). Plainclothes secret police worked inside Spanish universities.\n\nThe enforcement by public authorities of traditional [[Catholic values]] was a stated intent of the regime, mainly by using a law (the ''Ley de Vagos y Maleantes'', Vagrancy Act) enacted by [[Manuel Aza\u00f1a|Aza\u00f1a]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://search.boe.es/g/es/bases_datos/tifs.php?coleccion=gazeta&anyo=1933&nbo=217&lim=A&pub=BOE&pco=874&pfi=877 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012090326/http://search.boe.es/g/es/bases_datos/tifs.php?coleccion=gazeta&anyo=1933&nbo=217&lim=A&pub=BOE&pco=874&pfi=877 |archivedate=12 October 2007 |title=Gazeta hist\u00f3rica: Referencia: P\u00e1ginas TIFF |publisher=Bolet\u00edn Oficial del Estado |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}</ref> The remaining nomads of Spain ([[Romani people in Spain|Gitanos]] and [[Merchero]]s like [[Eleuterio S\u00e1nchez|El Lute]]) were especially affected.

Official propaganda confined the role of women to family care and motherhood. Immediately after the war most progressive laws passed by the Republic aimed at equality between the sexes were nullified. Women could not become judges, or testify in a trial. They could not become university professors. Their affairs and economic lives had to be managed by their fathers and husbands.

Under Franco, Spain also pursued a campaign to force a negotiation on the [[British overseas territory]] of [[Gibraltar]], and [[Disputed status of Gibraltar|closed its border with that territory]] in 1969. The border would not be fully reopened until 1985.\n\n=== Economic policy ===\n{{See also|Economic history of Spain#The Franco Era, 1939-75|l1=Economic history of Spain: Economy under Franco}}\nThe Civil War ravaged the Spanish economy.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Collier|first1=Paul|title=On the economic consequences of civil war|journal=Oxford Economic Papers 51|date=1999|pages=168\u2013183}}</ref> Infrastructure had been damaged, workers killed, and daily business severely hampered. For more than a decade after Franco's victory, the devastated economy recovered very slowly. Franco initially pursued a policy of [[autarky]], cutting off almost all international trade. The policy had devastating effects, and the economy stagnated. Only black marketeers could enjoy an evident affluence.\n\n[[File:Spanish peseta coin with Franco 1963.gif|thumb|left|1963 [[Spanish peseta]] coin with an image of Franco and lettering reading: \"Francisco Franco, Leader of Spain, by the grace of God\"]]\n\nOn the brink of bankruptcy, a combination of pressure from the [[United States]], the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] and, most importantly, the technocrats from [[Opus Dei]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}, managed to convince the regime to adopt a free market economy. Many of the old guard in charge of the economy were replaced by \"technocrata\", despite some initial opposition from Franco. From the mid-1950s there was modest acceleration in economic activity after some minor reforms and a relaxation of controls. But the growth proved too much for the economy, with shortages and inflation breaking out towards the end of the 1950s.\n\nWhen Franco replaced his ideological ministers with the apolitical technocrats, the regime implemented several development policies that included deep economic reforms. After a recession, growth took off from 1959, creating an economic boom that lasted until 1974, and became known as the \"[[Spanish Miracle]]\".\n\nConcurrent with the absence of social reforms, and the economic power shift, a tide of mass emigration commenced to other European countries, and to a lesser extent, to South America. Emigration helped the regime in two ways. The country got rid of populations it would not have been able to keep in employment, and the emigrants supplied the country with much needed monetary remittances.\n\nDuring the 1960s, the wealthy classes of Francoist Spain experienced further increases in wealth, particularly those who remained politically faithful, while a burgeoning middle class became visible as the \"economic miracle\" progressed. International firms established factories in Spain where salaries were low, company taxes very low, strikes forbidden and workers' health or state protections almost unheard of. State-owned firms like the car manufacturer [[SEAT]], truck builder [[Pegaso]] and oil refiner INH, massively expanded production. Furthermore, Spain was virtually a new mass market. Spain became the second-fastest growing economy in the world between 1959 and 1973, just behind Japan. By the time of Franco's death in 1975, Spain still lagged behind most of Western Europe but the gap between its per capita GDP and that of the leading Western European countries had narrowed greatly, and the country had developed a large industrialised economy.\n\n=== Regions ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}\n[[File:Visita de Francisco Franco a la localidad de Tolosa (5 de 21) - Fondo Car-Kutxa Fototeka.jpg|thumb|Franco's visit to [[Tolosa, Spain|Tolosa]] in 1948]]\n\nFranco was reluctant to enact any form of administrative and legislative decentralisation and kept a fully centralised government with a similar administrative structure to that established by the [[House of Bourbon]] and General [[Miguel Primo de Rivera y Orbaneja]]. Such structures were based on the model of the French centralised state. The main drawback of this kind of management was that government attention and initiatives were irregular, and often depended more on the goodwill of regional government representatives than on regional needs. Thus, inequalities in schooling, health care and transport facilities among regions were patent: classically affluent regions like Madrid, Catalonia, or the Basque Country fared much better than Extremadura, Galicia or Andalusia. Some regions, like Extremadura or La Mancha did not have a university.\n\nThe Basque Country and Catalonia were among the regions that offered the strongest resistance to Franco in the Civil War. Franco dissolved the autonomy granted by the [[Second Spanish Republic]] to these two regions and to [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]. Franco abolished the centuries-old fiscal privileges and autonomy (the ''[[fueros]]'') of two of the three Basque provinces: [[Guipuzcoa]] and [[Biscay]], but kept them for [[\u00c1lava]] which had sided with the nationalists in the civil war.\n\nFranco also decided to preserve [[Navarre]]'s centuries old fiscal privileges and autonomy, the so-called [[Fueros of Navarre]]. Navarre, the northern half of which was Basque-speaking, was one of Franco's areas of greatest support during the civil war. The regional privileges for \u00c1lava and Navarre were kept because they had participated in the initial ''coup d'\u00e9tat'' against the Republican government on 18 July 1936.\n\nFranco abolished the official statute and recognition of the [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Galician language|Galician]], and [[Catalan language]]s that the [[Second Spanish Republic]] had granted for the first time in the history of Spain. He returned to Castilian as the only official language of the state and education. The Franco era saw the popularisation of the compulsory national educational system and the development of modern mass media, both controlled by the state and both using the Castilian language, which significantly reduced the number of speakers of Basque, Catalan and Galician, as happened during the second half of the 20th century with other European minority languages which were not officially protected, such as [[Scottish Gaelic]] or French [[Breton language|Breton]]. By the 1970s the majority of the population in urban areas could not speak the [[minority language]] or, as in some Catalan towns, their social use had been abandoned, leaving them limited to family use.\n\nBecause of the already fragile situation of the Basque language before the Civil War, it became the most endangered language in Spain. By the 1970s Basque lacked a sufficient number of new speakers to assure its future, and moved closer to extinction. It is now recognised that the Basque language would have disappeared in a few more decades if the same linguistic policies had been preserved. This was the main reason that drove the Francoist provincial government of [[\u00c1lava]] to create a network of Basque medium schools ([[Ikastola]]) in 1973 which were state-financed.\n\n== Death and funeral ==\n[[File:Carlos Arias Navarro and Franco 1975.jpg|left|thumb|[[Carlos Arias Navarro]] and Franco at his residence in October 1975, around one week before he fell into an irreversible coma]]\nFranco decided to name a monarch to succeed his regency but the simmering tensions between the [[Carlists]] and the Alfonsoists continued. In a bid to avoid a repeat of the [[Carlist Wars]], he offered the throne to the [[Habsburg]] Archduke [[Otto von Habsburg]]; by doing so he believed that he could eliminate the question of a [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] succession entirely since the Habsburg family which had ruled the [[Habsburg Spain]] during its golden age had an alternate claim to the Spanish throne before the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]. Archduke Otto declined, stating that he would be seen as a [[Germans|German]] ruling Spain and could never forget his [[Austrians|Austrian]] identity. In 1969 Franco nominated as his heir-apparent Prince [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Juan Carlos de Borb\u00f3n]], who had been educated by him in Spain, with the new title of Prince of Spain. This designation came as a surprise to the [[Carlism|Carlist]] pretender to the throne, as well as to Juan Carlos's father, [[Juan de Borb\u00f3n|Don Juan, the Count of Barcelona]], who had a superior claim to the throne, but whom Franco feared to be too liberal. By 1973 Franco had surrendered the function of prime minister (''Presidente del Gobierno''), remaining only as head of state and commander in chief of the military.\n\nAs his final years progressed, tensions within the various factions of the ''Movimiento'' would consume Spanish political life, as varying groups jockeyed for position in an effort to win control of the country's future. The death of prime minister [[Luis Carrero Blanco]] in a [[Assassination of Luis Carrero Blanco|20 December 1973 bombing]] by [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] eventually gave an edge to the liberalizing faction. On 19 July 1974, the aged Franco fell ill from various health problems, and Juan Carlos took over as Acting Head of State. Franco soon recovered and on 2 September he resumed his duties as Head of State. A year later he fell ill again, afflicted with further health issues, including a long battle with [[Parkinson's disease]]. Franco's last public appearance was on 1 October 1975 when, despite his gaunt and frail appearance, he gave a speech to crowds from the balcony at the Royal Palace of El Pardo in Madrid. On 30 October 1975 he fell into a [[coma]] and was put on [[life support]]. Franco's family agreed to disconnect the life-support machines. Officially, he died a few minutes after midnight on 20 November 1975 from heart failure, at the age of 82 \u2014 the same date as the death of [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Primo de Rivera]], the founder of the [[Falange]]. Historian [[Ricardo de la Cierva]] claimed that he had been told around 6 pm on 19 November that Franco had already died.<ref>{{cite book |last=de la Cierva |first=Ricardo|authorlink=Ricardo de la Cierva|title=Agonia y Muerte de Franco|language=Spanish|trans-title=Agony and Death of Franco|publisher=Eudema Universidad|date=1996 |pages=|chapter=|isbn=9788477542179}}</ref>\n\nFranco's body was interred at [[Valle de los Ca\u00eddos]], a colossal memorial built by the forced labour of [[political prisoner]]s in order to honour the casualties of the Spanish Civil War.

After hearing the lectures of [[Justus von Liebig]] in his first semester, he decided to study chemistry. Following four years of study in [[Giessen]] and a brief compulsory military service, he took temporary assistantships in [[Paris]] (1851\u201352), in [[Chur]], Switzerland (1852\u201353), and in [[London]] (1853\u201355), where he was decisively influenced by [[Alexander William Williamson|Alexander Williamson]].

In 1858 he was hired as full professor at the [[University of Ghent]], then in 1867 he was called to [[University of Bonn|Bonn]], where he remained for the rest of his career.  Basing his ideas on those of predecessors such as Williamson, [[Edward Frankland]], [[William Odling]], [[Auguste Laurent]], [[Charles-Adolphe Wurtz]] and others, Kekul\u00e9 was the principal formulator of the theory of chemical structure (1857\u201358). This theory proceeds from the idea of atomic valence, especially the [[tetravalence]] of carbon (which Kekul\u00e9 announced late in 1857)<ref>{{cite journal|title=\u00dcber die s. g. gepaarten Verbindungen und die Theorie der mehratomigen Radicale|author=Aug. Kekul\u00e9|journal=[[Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie]]|year=1857|volume=104|issue=2|pages=129\u2013150|doi= 10.1002/jlac.18571040202}}</ref> and the ability of carbon atoms to link to each other (announced in a paper published in May 1858),<ref>{{cite journal|title=Ueber die Constitution und die Metamorphosen der chemischen Verbindungen und \u00fcber die chemische Natur des Kohlenstoffs|author=Aug.

[[Archibald Scott Couper]] independently arrived at the idea of self-linking of carbon atoms (his paper appeared in June 1858),<ref>{{cite journal|title=Sur une nouvelle th\u00e9orie chimique|author=A.S. Couper|journal=[[Annales de chimie et de physique]]|volume=53|year=1858|pages=488\u2013489|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k34794n/f468.table}}</ref> and provided the first molecular formulas where lines symbolize bonds connecting the atoms. For organic chemists, the theory of structure provided dramatic new clarity of understanding, and a reliable guide to both analytic and especially synthetic work. As a consequence, the field of organic chemistry developed explosively from this point. Among those who were most active in pursuing early structural investigations were, in addition to Kekul\u00e9 and Couper, [[Edward Frankland|Frankland]], [[Wurtz]], [[Alexander Crum Brown]], [[Emil Erlenmeyer]], and [[Alexander Butlerov]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nKekul\u00e9's idea of assigning certain atoms to certain positions within the molecule, and schematically connecting them using what he called their \"Verwandtschaftseinheiten\" (\"affinity units\", now called \"[[valence (chemistry)|valence]]s\" or \"bonds\"), was based largely on evidence from chemical reactions, rather than on instrumental methods that could peer directly into the molecule, such as [[X-ray crystallography]].  Such physical methods of structural determination had not yet been developed, so chemists of Kekul\u00e9's day had to rely almost entirely on so-called \"wet\" chemistry. Some chemists, notably [[Hermann Kolbe]], heavily criticized the use of structural formulas that were offered, as he thought, without proof.   However, most chemists followed Kekul\u00e9's lead in pursuing and developing what some have called \"classical\" structure theory, which was modified after the discovery of electrons (1897) and the development of quantum mechanics (in the 1920s).\n\nThe idea that the number of valences of a given element was invariant was a key component of Kekul\u00e9's version of structural chemistry. This generalization suffered from many exceptions, and was subsequently replaced by the suggestion that valences were fixed at certain oxidation states. For example, [[periodic acid]] according to Kekul\u00e9an structure theory could be represented by the chain structure I-O-O-O-O-H.  By contrast, the modern structure of (meta) periodic acid has all four oxygen atoms surrounding the iodine in a tetrahedral geometry.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n==Benzene==\n[[File:Historic Benzene Formulae Kekul\u00e9 (original).png|thumb|Kekul\u00e9 structure of benzene with alternating double bonds]]\nKekul\u00e9's most famous work was on the structure of [[benzene]]. In 1865 Kekul\u00e9 published a paper in French (for he was then still in Belgium) suggesting that the structure contained a six-membered ring of carbon atoms with alternating single and double bonds.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Sur la constitution des substances aromatiques|author=Aug.

[[Archibald Scott Couper]] in 1858 and [[Joseph Loschmidt]] in 1861 suggested possible structures that contained multiple double bonds or multiple rings, but the study of [[aromatic compound]]s was in its earliest years, and too little evidence was then available to help chemists decide on any particular structure.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nMore evidence was available by 1865, especially regarding the relationships of aromatic [[isomer]]s.  Kekul\u00e9 argued for his proposed structure by considering the number of isomers observed for derivatives of benzene. For every monoderivative of benzene (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>X, where X = Cl, OH, CH<sub>3</sub>, NH<sub>2</sub>, etc.) only one isomer was ever found, implying that all six carbons are equivalent, so that substitution on any carbon gives only a single possible product. For diderivatives such as the [[toluidine]]s, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>(NH<sub>2</sub>)(CH<sub>3</sub>), three isomers were observed, for which Kekul\u00e9 proposed structures with the two substituted carbon atoms separated by one, two and three carbon-carbon bonds, later named [[Arene substitution pattern|ortho, meta, and para]] isomers respectively.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldofchemicals.com/488/chemistry-articles/friedrich-august-kekule-von-stradonitz-principal-founder-of-chemical-structure.html|title=Friedrich August Kekule von Stradonitz \u2013inventor of benzene structure - World Of Chemicals|website=www.worldofchemicals.com|access-date=2018-03-02}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nThe counting of possible isomers for diderivatives was however criticized by [[Albert Ladenburg]], a former student of Kekul\u00e9, who argued that Kekul\u00e9's 1865 structure implied two distinct \"ortho\" structures, depending on whether the substituted carbons are separated by a single or a double bond.<ref>Ladenburg, Albert (1869) [https://books.google.com/books?id=Epg8AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA140#v=onepage&q&f=false \"Bemerkungen zur aromatischen Theorie\"] (Observations on the aromatic theory), ''Berichte der Deutschen Chemischen Gesellschaft'', '''2''' : 140\u2013142.</ref> Since ortho derivatives of benzene were never actually found in more than one isomeric form, Kekul\u00e9 modified his proposal in 1872 and suggested that the benzene molecule oscillates between two equivalent structures, in such a way that the single and double bonds continually interchange positions.<ref>See pages 86\u201389 of:  Auguste Kekul\u00e9 (1872) [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uva.x002457985;view=1up;seq=469 \"Ueber einige Condensationsprodukte des Aldehyds\"] (On some condensation products of aldehydes), ''Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie'', '''162''' (1): 77\u2013124, 309\u2013320.</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Pierre Laszlo |url=http://www.hyle.org/journal/issues/10-1/rev_laszlo.htm |publisher=Hyle |journal=International Journal for Philosophy of Chemistry |volume=10 |issue=1 |date=April 2004 |issn=1433-5158 |title=Book Review: Jerome A.

He was the first emperor of the [[House of Habsburg]], and the third member of the House of Habsburg to be elected to King of Germany after [[Rudolph I of Germany]] and [[Albert I of Germany|Albert I]] in the 13th century. He was the penultimate emperor to be [[Coronation of the Holy Roman Emperor|crowned]] by the [[Pope]], and the last to be crowned in [[Rome]].\n\nPrior to his imperial coronation, he was duke of the [[Inner Austria]]n lands of [[Duchy of Styria|Styria]], [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthia]] and [[Duchy of Carniola|Carniola]] from 1424, and also acted as [[regent]] over the [[Duchy of Austria]] (as '''Frederick V''') from 1439. He was [[imperial election of 1440|elected]] and crowned [[List of German monarchs|King of Germany]] (as '''Frederick IV''') in 1440.<ref>He was the fourth Frederick to rule Germany in the Habsburgs' preferred enumeration, which counted [[Frederick the Fair]] (\"Frederick III\") as a legitimate king, although he was elected by only a minority of electors. Cf. Anthony Radcliffe (1986), \"The Habsburg Images: Cigoli, Terzio and Reichle\", ''The Burlington Magazine'', 128 (995), 103\u201306.</ref> He was the longest-reigning German monarch when in 1493, after ruling his domains for more than 53 years, he was succeeded by his son [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]].\n\nDuring his reign, Frederick concentrated on re-uniting the Habsburg \"[[Habsburg Monarchy|hereditary lands]]\" of Austria and took a lesser interest in [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] affairs. Nevertheless, by his dynastic entitlement to [[Kingdom of Hungary (1301\u20131526)|Hungary]] as well as by the [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundian]] inheritance, he laid the foundations for the later Habsburg Empire. Mocked as \"Arch-Sleepyhead of the Holy Roman Empire\" ({{lang-de|Erzschlafm\u00fctze}}) during his lifetime,<ref>{{cite book |title=The Habsburgs: The History of a Dynasty |first=Benjamin |last=Curtis |page=36 |year=2013 |publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing|Bloomsbury]]}}</ref> he is today increasingly seen as an efficient ruler.{{According to whom|date=October 2018}}\n\n==Early life==\nBorn at the [[County of Tyrol|Tyrolean]] residence of [[Innsbruck]] in 1415, Frederick was the eldest son of the Inner Austrian duke [[Ernest, Duke of Austria|Ernest the Iron]], a member of the [[Leopoldian line]] of the Habsburg dynasty, and his second wife [[Cymburgis of Masovia]]. According to the 1379 [[Treaty of Neuberg]], the Leopoldinian branch ruled over the duchies of Styria, Carinthia and Carniola, or what was referred to as Inner Austria. Only three of Frederick's eight siblings survived childhood: his younger brother [[Albert VI, Archduke of Austria|Albert]] (later to be Albert VI, archduke of Austria), and his sisters [[Margaret of Austria, Electress of Saxony|Margaret]] (later the electress of Saxony) and [[Catherine of Austria (1420\u20131493)|Catherine]]. In 1424, nine-year-old Frederick's father died, making Frederick the duke of Inner Austria, as Frederick V, with his uncle, Duke [[Frederick IV, Duke of Austria|Frederick IV of Tyrol]], acting as regent.\n\nFrom 1431, Frederick tried to obtain majority (to be declared \"of age\", and thus allowed to rule) but for several years was denied by his relatives. Finally, in 1435, [[Albert II of Germany|Albert V, duke of Austria]] (later Albert II, the king of Germany), awarded him the rule over his Inner Austrian heritage. Almost from the beginning, Frederick's younger brother Albert asserted his rights as a co-ruler, as the beginning of a long rivalry. Already in these years, Frederick had begun to use the symbolic [[A.E.I.O.U.]] signature as a kind of [[motto]] with various meanings. In 1436 he made a pilgrimage to the [[Holy Land]], accompanied by numerous nobles knighted by the [[Order of the Holy Sepulchre]], which earned him great reputation.\n\nUpon the death of his uncle Duke Frederick IV in 1439, Frederick took over the regency of Tyrol and [[Further Austria]] for the duke's heir [[Sigismund, Archduke of Austria|Sigismund]]. Again he had to ward off the claims raised by his brother Albert VI; he prevailed by the support of the Tyrolean aristocracy. Likewise he acted as regent for his nephew [[Ladislaus the Posthumous]], son of late King Albert II and his consort [[Elizabeth of Luxembourg]], in the [[duchy of Austria]] (Further Austria).  (Ladislaus would unfortunately die before coming of age). Frederick was now the undisputed head of the Habsburg dynasty, though his regency in the lands of the [[Albertinian Line]] (Further Austria) was still viewed with suspicion.\n\nAs a cousin of late King Albert II, Frederick became a candidate for the imperial election. On 2 February 1440, the [[prince-electors]] convened at [[Frankfurt]] and unanimously elected him [[King of the Romans]] as Frederick IV; his rule was still based on his hereditary lands of Styria, Carinthia and Carniola, or Inner Austria.\n\nIn 1442, Frederick allied himself with [[Rudolf St\u00fcssi]], [[burgomaster]] of [[Zurich]], against the [[Old Swiss Confederacy]] in the [[Old Zurich War]] (Alter Z\u00fcrichkrieg) but lost.  In 1448, he entered into the [[Concordat of Vienna]] with the [[Holy See]], which remained in force until 1806 and regulated the relationship between the Habsburgs and the Holy See.\n\nIn 1452, at the age of 37, Frederick III travelled to Italy to receive his bride and to be crowned [[Holy Roman Emperor]]. His fianc\u00e9e, the 18-year-old ''infanta'' [[Eleanor of Portugal, Holy Roman Empress|Eleanor]], daughter of King [[Edward of Portugal]], landed at [[Livorno]] (Leghorn) after a 104-day trip. Her dowry would help Frederick alleviate his debts and cement his power. The couple met at [[Siena]] on 24 February and proceeded together to Rome. As per tradition, they spent a night outside the walls of Rome before entering the city on 9 March, where Frederick and [[Pope Nicholas V]] exchanged friendly greetings. Because the emperor had been unable to retrieve the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy]] from the [[cathedral of Monza]] where it was kept, nor be crowned [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|King of Italy]] by the [[archbishop of Milan]] (on account of Frederick's dispute with [[Francesco I Sforza|Francesco Sforza]], lord of Milan), he convinced the pope to crown him as such with the German crown, which had been brought for the purpose. This coronation took place on the morning of 16 March, in spite of the protests of the Milanese ambassadors, and in the afternoon Frederick and Eleanor were married by the pope. Finally, on 19 March, Frederick and Eleanor were anointed in [[St Peter's Basilica]] by the Vice-Chancellor of the Holy Roman Church, Cardinal [[Francesco Condulmer]], and Frederick was then crowned with the [[Imperial Crown of the Holy Roman Empire|Imperial Crown]] by the pope.<ref>M.

The Italian humanist Enea Silvio Piccolomini, later [[Pope Pius II]], who at one time worked at Frederick's court, described the Emperor as a person who wanted to conquer the world while remaining seated. Although this was regarded as a character flaw in older academic research, his delaying tactics are now viewed as a means of coping with political challenges in far-flung territorial possessions. Frederick is credited with having the ability to sit out difficult political situations patiently.<ref name=heimann>''Heinz-Dieter Heimann: Die Habsburger. Dynastie und Kaiserreiche. {{ISBN|3-406-44754-6}}. pp.38-45</ref>\n\nAccording to contemporary accounts, Frederick had difficulties developing emotional closeness to other persons, including his children and wife [[Eleanor of Portugal, Holy Roman Empress|Eleanor]]. In general, Frederick kept himself away from women, the reasons for which are not known. As Frederick was rather distant to his family, Eleanor had a great influence on the raising and education of Frederick's children, and she therefore played an important role in the House of Habsburg's rise to prominence. Despite the fact that their marriage had been unhappy, when Eleanor died the Emperor was affected by her loss and remained widowed for the rest of his long life.<ref name=heimann/>\n\n==Emperor==\n{{expand section|small=no|material on activities from 1475 to 1493|date=September 2017}}\n[[File:Pintoricchio 002a.jpg|thumb|200px|Detail of ''[[Pope Pius II|Aeneas Piccolomini]] introduces [[Eleanor of Portugal, Holy Roman Empress|Eleonora of Portugal]] to Frederick III'' by [[Pinturicchio]] (1454\u20131513)]]\n\nFrederick's political initiatives were hardly bold, but they were still successful. His first major opponent was his brother [[Albert VI, Archduke of Austria|Albert VI]], who challenged his rule. He did not manage to win a single conflict on the battlefield against him, and thus resorted to more subtle means. He held his [[consanguinity|second cousin once removed]] [[Ladislaus the Posthumous]], the ruler of the [[Archduchy of Austria]], Hungary and Bohemia, (born in 1440) as a prisoner and attempted to extend his guardianship over him in perpetuity to maintain his control over [[Lower Austria]]. Ladislaus was freed in 1452 by the Lower Austrian estates. He acted similarly towards his first cousin [[Sigismund, Archduke of Austria|Sigismund]] of the Tyrolian line of the Habsburg family. Despite those efforts, he failed to gain control over [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] and [[Bohemia]] in the [[Bohemian\u2013Hungarian War (1468\u201378)]] and was even defeated in the [[Austrian\u2013Hungarian War (1477\u201388)]] by the Hungarian King [[Matthias Corvinus]] in 1485, who managed to maintain residence in [[Vienna]] until his death five years later in the [[Siege of Vienna (1485)|Siege of Vienna]].\n\nUltimately, Frederick prevailed in all those conflicts by outliving his opponents and sometimes inheriting their lands, as was the case with Ladislaus, from whom he gained Lower Austria in 1457, and with his brother Albert VI, whom he succeeded in [[Upper Austria]]. In 1462, his brother Albert raised an insurrection against him in [[Vienna]] and the emperor was besieged in his residence by rebellious subjects. In this war between the brothers, Frederick received support from the King of Bohemia, [[George of Pod\u011bbrady]]. These conflicts forced him into an anachronistic itinerant existence, as he had to move his court between various places through the years, residing in [[Graz]], [[Linz]] and {{lang|de|[[Wiener Neustadt]]}}.<ref>Joachim Laczny: ''{{lang|de|Friedrich III.

In the [[Siege of Neuss]] (1474\u201375), he forced [[Charles the Bold]] of Burgundy to give up his daughter [[Mary of Burgundy]] as wife to Frederick's son [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian]]. With the inheritance of Burgundy, the House of Habsburg began to rise to predominance in Europe. This gave rise to the saying \"Let others wage wars, but you, happy Austria, shall marry\", which became a motto of the dynasty.\n\nThe marriage of his daughter [[Kunigunde of Austria|Kunigunde]] to [[Albert IV, Duke of Bavaria]], was another result of intrigues and deception, but must be counted as a defeat for Frederick. Albert illegally took control of some imperial [[fief]]s and then asked to marry Kunigunde (who lived in Innsbruck, far from her father), offering to give her the fiefs as a [[dower]]. Frederick agreed at first, but after Albert took over yet another fief, [[Regensburg]], Frederick withdrew his consent. On 2 January 1487, however, before Frederick's change of heart could be communicated to his daughter, Kunigunde married Albert. A war was prevented only through the mediation of the Emperor's son, Maximilian.\n\nIn some smaller matters, Frederick was quite successful: in 1469 he managed to establish [[bishopric]]s in [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Vienna|Vienna]] and {{lang|de|[[Roman Catholic Diocese of Wiener Neustadt|Wiener Neustadt]]}}, a step that no previous Duke of Austria had been able to achieve.\n\nFrederick's personal motto was the mysterious string [[A.E.I.O.U.]], which he imprinted on all his belongings. He never explained its meaning, leading to many different interpretations being presented, although it has been claimed that shortly before his death he said it stands for ''{{lang|la|Austriae Est Imperare Orbi Universali}}'' or ''{{lang|de|Alles Erdreich ist \u00d6sterreich untertan}}'' (\"All the world is subject to Austria\").

However, it might have referred instead (or also) to wealth, luck or destiny. \n\nIn 1339 the Mallorcan navigator [[Angelino Dulcert]], in the Planisferio de Angelino Dulcert, referred to the island as \"Forte Ventura\". <ref>[https://www.bienmesabe.org/noticia/2009/Enero/toponimia-sorpresiva-fuerteventura Toponimia sorpresiva.

However, it has been suggested that, at some point, Maxorata (which meant \"the children of the country\") was the aboriginal toponym of the entire island.<ref>{{Cita web |url=http://insuloamaziq.blogspot.com.es/2012/09/mahorata.html |t\u00edtulo=Nombre ind\u00edgena de Fuerteventura |fechaacceso=21 de octubre de 2013 |urlarchivo=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021222338/http://insuloamaziq.blogspot.com.es/2012/09/mahorata.html |fechaarchivo=21 de octubre de 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Blick auf Morro Jable.jpg|thumb|right|Morro Jable]]\n\n=== Precolonial history ===\n[[File:Cant\u00f3n de Maxorata.jpg|thumb|The two kingdoms of the Precolonial Fuerteventura, Jand\u00eda and Maxorata.]]\nThe first settlers of Fuerteventura are believed to have come from North Africa. The word ''Mahorero'' (''Majorero'') or ''Maho'' is still used today to describe the people of Fuerteventura and is derived from the ancient word 'mahos', a type of goatskin shoe worn by these original inhabitants. They lived in caves and semi-subterranean dwellings, some of which have been excavated, revealing remnants of early tools and pottery. In antiquity, the island was known o.a. as ''Planaria'', in reference to the flatness of most of its terrain.\n\nIn the 11th century BC, [[Phoenicia]]n settlers landed in Fuerteventura and [[Lanzarote]].\n\nSeveral Spanish and Portuguese expeditions to the islands were organized around 1340, followed by Moors and European slave traders. At the end of the Iberian conquest, the island was divided into two [[Guanches]] kingdoms, one adhering to King Guize and the other to King Ayoze. The territories of these kingdoms were called [[Maxorata Canton|Maxorata]] (in the North) and [[Jand\u00eda Canton|Jand\u00eda]] (in the South) respectively. They were separated by a wall, which traversed the La Pared isthmus. Some remains have been preserved. The ancient name for the island, Erbania, is derived from this wall's name.\n\n=== The conquest ===\nThe island's conquest began in earnest in 1402, commanded by French knights and crusaders [[Jean de B\u00e9thencourt]] and [[Gadifer de la Salle]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fuerteventura.com/History/conquest.shtml |title=Fuerteventura History - The Conquest of Fuerteventura |publisher=Fuerteventura.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-12}}</ref> They arrived with only 63 sailors out of the original 283, as many had deserted along the way. After arriving and settling in [[Lanzarote]], the invaders made some first excursions to the neighboring islands. In 1404, Bethencourt and Gadifer founded [[Betancuria]], on the West coast, the first settlement on the island. After numerous difficulties, Gadifer took charge of the invasion, while Bethencourt returned to Spain to seek the recognition and support of the Castilian king.\n[[File:Iglesia Betancuria.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Parish of Santa Mar\u00eda de Betancuria, [[Betancuria]].]]\n\nIn 1405, de B\u00e9thencourt completed his conquest of the island, establishing its capital in Betancuria (Puerto Rosario took over the mantle as island capital in 1835).\n\nIn 1424 Pope [[Martin V]], through the [[Betancuria]] Brief, edicted the establishment of the [[Bishopric of Fuerteventura]], which encompassed all the [[Canary Islands]] save for the island of [[Lanzarote]].<ref>[http://www.juliosanchezrodriguez.com/convertidos/07-02_Cisma.pdf El Cisma de Occidente y el Obispado de Fuerteventura]</ref> The origin of this bishopric is directly related to the events that occurred after the [[Western Schism|Great Schism]] (1378-1417), in that the bishop of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Canarias|San Marcial del Rubic\u00f3n]] of [[Lanzarote]] (at the time, the only diocese in the Canary Islands) did not recognize the papacy of Martin V, and instead adhered to [[anti-Pope]] [[Antipope Benedict XIII|Benedict XIII]]. The ''Bishopric of Fuerteventura'' was based in the ''Parish of Santa Mar\u00eda de Betancuria'', bestowing upon the latter the status of Grant Cathedral. After the reabsorbtion of the ''Diocese of San Marcial del Rubic\u00f3n'' by the papacy of Pope of Martin V, the Bishopric of Fuerteventura was abolished in 1431, only seven years after it was created.<ref>[http://www.juliosanchezrodriguez.com/convertidos/07-02_Cisma.pdf El Cisma de Occidente y el Obispado de Fuerteventura]</ref>\n\nThe first census recorded a population of some 1,200 inhabitants. The population increased gradually thereafter. In 1476 the territory became the ''Se\u00f1or\u00edo Territorial de Fuerteventura'', subjected to the [[Catholic Monarchs]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070401163550/http://www.ayuntamientotuineje.com/modules.php?name=Content&pa=showpage&pid=59&page=3 Se reconoce al conquistador su dominio sobre la isla.] Fuente: Ayuntamiento de [[Tuineje]].</ref> In later years, the island was invaded by the Spanish, French and the English.\n\n=== Colonial Fuerteventura ===\nOver time, the island endured numerous pirate raids. A [[Berber people|Berber]] lead expedition invaded in 1593, sweeping as far inland as the capital. Various castles were built along the coastline, to protect against these type of attacks. The population was moved inland as a second protective measure. Because of the raids, a first ''Captain General'' was dispatched to Fuerteventura, accompanied by a number of ''Sergeant Majors'', to defend the island in the name of the Crown. At that time Betancuria became the religious capital of the island.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070401163550/http://www.ayuntamientotuineje.com/modules.php?name=Content&pa=showpage&pid=59&page=3 The principal economic motor of the epoch was orchilla, cereal and cattle.] Source: [[Tuineje]] council.</ref>\n\nTwo major [[Pirate attacks on Fuerteventura in 1740|pirate attacks]] took place in 1740, within a month of each other. Two separate bands of English privateers attempted to loot the town of Tuineje. These attacks were however successfully averted by the local population and the island's militia. This successful repelling of the invaders is celebrated at a re-enactment that takes place in Gran Tarajal every year in October.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gran Tarajal|url=https://www.fuerteventuraguide.com/gran-tarajal/|website=Fuerteventura Guide|accessdate=26 July 2017|ref=32}}</ref>\n\nThe island's garrison was officially instated in 1708. Its colonel assumed the title of ''Governor at Arms'', a hereditary, lifelong appointment which has remained in the S\u00e1nchez-Dumpi\u00e9rrez family.

In 1927, Fuerteventura and [[Lanzarote]] became part of the province of [[Gran Canaria]]. The seat of the island's government (''cabildo insular'') is located in [[Puerto del Rosario]]. A total of 74,983 people lived on the island in 2003.\n\nBy the 1940s the island had an airport (just west of [[Puerto del Rosario]] on the road to Tindaya, still visible today). Mass tourism began to arrive in the mid-1960s, facilitated by the construction of [[Fuerteventura Airport]] at [[El Matorral]] and the first tourist hotels.\n\nThe island's proximity (a mere 100&nbsp;km) to the West African coast and the fact that it is part of the [[Schengen Area|Schengen]] territory make it a prime target destination for undocumented immigrants. However, many have perished while attempting the crossing.<ref>http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/news-stories/press-release/msf-assists-immigrants-arriving-fuerteventura-island</ref>\n\n==Environment==\n[[File:Barranco de Pecenescal - Fuerteventura.jpg|thumb|700px|center|Barranco de Pecenescal]]\n\n===Geography===\nThe elongated island has an area of {{convert|1660|km2|0|abbr=on}}.  The island is {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=off}} long and {{convert|31|km|0|abbr=off}} wide. It is part of the province of [[Las Palmas (province)|Las Palmas]]. It is divided into six [[List of municipalities in Las Palmas|municipalities]]:\n*[[Antigua, Las Palmas|Antigua]]\n*[[Betancuria, Las Palmas|Betancuria]]\n*[[La Oliva, Las Palmas|La Oliva]]\n*[[P\u00e1jara, Las Palmas|P\u00e1jara]]\n*[[Puerto del Rosario, Las Palmas|Puerto del Rosario]]\n*[[Tuineje, Las Palmas|Tuineje]]\n100 individual settlements are distributed through these municipalities. A nearby islet, [[Islote de Lobos]], is part of the municipality of [[La Oliva]].\n\nLocated just {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=on}} off the coast of north Africa, it is the second biggest of the islands, after Tenerife, and has the longest white sand beaches in the archipelago. The island is a destination for sun, beach and watersports enthusiasts. It lies at the same latitude as Florida and Mexico and temperatures rarely fall below {{convert|18|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} or rise above {{convert|32|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}. It counts 152 separate beaches along its seaboard \u2014 {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}} of white sand and {{convert|25|km|0|abbr=on}} of black volcanic shingle.\n\nThe highest point in Fuerteventura is Pico de la Zarza (807 m) in the southwestern part of the island. Geographical features include '''Istmo de la Pared''' which is {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} wide and is the narrowest part of Fuerteventura. The island is divided into two parts, the northern portion which is '''Maxorata''' and the southwestern part called the Jand\u00eda peninsula.\n\n===Geology===\nFuerteventura is the oldest island in the Canary Islands dating back 20 million years to a volcanic eruption from the [[Canary hotspot]]. The majority of the island was created about 5 million years ago and since then has been eroded by wind and precipitation. On the seabed off the West coast of the island rests an enormous slab of bedrock {{convert|22|km|0|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|11|km|0|abbr=on}} wide, which appears to have slid off the island largely intact at some point in prehistory, similar to the predicted future collapse of [[Cumbre Vieja]], a geological fault on another Canary Island, [[La Palma]]. The last volcanic activity in Fuerteventura occurred between 4,000 and 5,000 years ago.\n\n{{wide image|Fuerteventura D81 6914 (39814797895).jpg|700px|Fuerteventura seen from the south.}}\n{{wide image|Fuerteventura D81 6947 (40667534382).jpg|700px|Road 605 through southern Fuerteventura.}}\n{{wide image|Fuerteventura D81 7067 (40710092191).jpg|700px|Jandia natural park on Fuerteventura.}}\n\n[[File:shoreline.jpg|thumb|250px|Typical xerophytic vegetation in Fuerteventura.

The island is hence referred to as ''the island of eternal spring''. The sea regulates air temperature, diverting hot [[Sahara]] winds away from the island. The island's name in English translates as \"strong fortune\" or \"strong wind\", the Spanish word for wind being ''[[:wiktionary:viento|viento]]''. During the winter months, temperatures average a high of {{convert|22|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} and a low of around {{convert|15|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}, whereas during the summer a mean high of {{convert|28|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} and a low of {{convert|20|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} can be expected. Precipitation is about {{convert|147|mm|0|abbr=on}} per year, most of which falls in autumn and winter. December is the month with highest rainfall.\n\nA sandstorm known as the [[Saharan Air Layer|Calima]] (similar to the [[Sirocco]] wind, which blows to the North of the Sahara, to Europe) may blow from the Sahara Desert to the Northwest, and can cause high temperatures, low visibility and drying air. Temperatures during this phenomenon rise temporarily by approximately 10 degrees Celsius. The wind brings in fine red dust, The fine white sand is not blown in from Sahara, It is made up of dead coral reef and local seabed upheaval. visibility can drop to between {{convert|100|to|200|m|2|abbr=on|lk=out}} or even lower and can even bring African [[locust]]s to the island.\n[[File:xerophytic brassica.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Food plant of ''[[Pontia daplidice]]'' on Fuerteventura.

It is also inhabited by many wild dogs and cats. On the barren, rocky land there are [[Barbary ground squirrel]]s and [[gecko]]s. Fuerteventura also hosts several migratory and nesting birds. The island has significant populations of the [[collared dove]], common [[swift]]s and several [[finch]] species especially in the vicinity of holiday developments.\n[[File:Euphorbia regis-jubae.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Euphorbia regis-jubae'', food plant of ''[[Hyles tithymali]]''.]]\n\nDespite its arid climate, the island is also home to a surprisingly large insect fauna. Butterflies which commonly occur on the island include the clouded yellow ([[''Colias hyale'']]) and the bath white (''[[Pontia daplidice]]'') which feeds on [[xerophytic]] [[cruciferae]]. The island is also home to the monarch butterfly (''[[Danaus plexippus]]'') and its close African relative ''[[Danaus chrysippus]]''. Around holiday developments such as [[Caleta de Fuste]], water is relatively abundant, and [[dragonfly]] species including the blue emperor, ''[[Anax imperator]]'' and the scarlet darter, ''[[Crocothemis erythraea]]'' can be found. The islands sand dunes and shoreline are home to a number of [[bee]] and [[wasp]] species including the large [[Eumenid]] caterpillar hunting wasp, ''[[Delta dimidiatipenne]]'' and the blue banded bee, (''[[Amegilla canifrons]]'').\n\n[[File:Delta dimiatipenne.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The hunting wasp ''Delta dimiatipenne''.]]\n[[Hawkmoth]]s also occur on the island. One of the more notable species is ''[[Hyles tithymali]]'' which feeds on endemic spurges such as ''Euphorbia regis-jubae''. ''[[Acherontia atropos]]'', the deaths-head hawkmoth also occurs on the island presumably feeding on members of the [[Solanaceae]], for example, ''[[Datura innoxia]]'' and ''[[Nicotiana glauca]]'' which are common weeds in the vicinity of human habitation.\n\n== Natural symbols ==\n{{Main article|List of animal and plant symbols of the Canary Islands}}\nThe official natural symbols associated with Fuerteventura are ''[[Chlamydotis undulata fuertaventurae]]'' (hubara or houbara) and ''[[Euphorbia handiensis]]'' (Card\u00f3n de Jand\u00eda).<ref>[http://www.gobcan.es/boc/1991/061/001.html Ley 7/1991, de 30 de abril, de s\u00edmbolos de la naturaleza para las Islas Canarias]</ref>\n\n<center><gallery>\nFile:Chlamydotis undulata fuertaventurae 3.jpg|''[[Chlamydotis undulata fuertaventurae]]''\nFile:Euphorbia handiensis 02 ies.jpg|''[[Euphorbia handiensis]]''\n</gallery></center>\n\n== Demographics ==\n[[File:MVC-024S.JPG|thumb|250px|right|The People's University Building, a branch of UNED ([[Puerto del Rosario]]).]]\n\n=== Population ===\nThe island has a population of 74,983.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ine.es/jaxi/tabla.do?path=/t20/e260/a2009/l0/&file=is01.px&type=pcaxis&L=0|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929184009/http://www.ine.es/jaxi/tabla.do?path=%2Ft20%2Fe260%2Fa2009%2Fl0%2F&file=is01.px&type=pcaxis&L=0|archivedate=29 September 2015|title=Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica.|publisher=|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Throughout its long history, Fuerteventura has suffered from a [[population decline]] due to the economic situation and the climate, which have made it into a desert island.

Wind surfing takes places at locations around the island. Sailors, scuba divers and big-game fishermen are all drawn to these clear blue Atlantic waters where whales, dolphins, marlin and turtles are all common sights. With many hills present throughout the Island, hikers are also attracted to this Island.<ref>{{cite book \n | work=Landscapes of Fuerteventura, A Countryside Guide\n | title=Landscapes of Fuerteventura, A Countryside Guide, 4th edition\n | author=Noel Rochford\n | publisher=Sunflower Books\n | year=2007\n}}</ref>\n\nExcellent sandy beaches are found in many locations. Western beaches, such as those around El Cotillo, can experience strong surf. The beaches adjoining the extensive sand dunes east of [[Corralejo]] are popular, as are the more protected extensive sandy shores of the Playa de Sotavento de Jandia on the southeastern coast between [[Costa Calma]] and the Morro Jable. Naked sun bathing and swimming are the norm almost on all beaches.\n\nMuch of the interior, with its large plains, lavascapes and volcanic mountains, consists of protected areas, although there are organised tours and vehicular access across them.\n[[File:fuerteventura panorama1 1200px.jpg|thumb|700px|center|Mountaintop of Card\u00f3n (619 m), viewed from the west.]]\n\n== Art and culture ==\n\n=== Traditional holidays ===\n[[File:Gala reina 2000 Fuerteventura.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Candidates compete to be Queen of the Rose Festival in 2001 [[Puerto del Rosario]].]]\n[[File:Virgen de la Pe\u00f1a, Vega del R\u00edo Palmas Betancuria Fuerteventura.jpg|thumb|250px|Alabaster image of the [[Virgen de la Pe\u00f1a (Fuerteventura)|Virgen de la Pe\u00f1a (Patron saint of Fuerteventura)]].]]\nLike the rest of the Canaries, Carnival is traditionally one of the biggest festivals celebrated on the island.

They include activities such as parades and galas to choose the carnival king.\n\n=== Concerts and festivals ===\n[[File:King Africa in Puerto del Rosario.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[King \u00c1frica]] in [[Puerto del Rosario]] in 2000.]]\nThere are many concerts and festivals held in the auditoriums, such as the Festival of Canarian Music. They are also held in smaller venues across the island, featuring bands such as Estopa, Van Gogh's Ear, and King Afrhica.\n\n*Lebrancho Rock: in 2004, the Town Hall of [[Puerto del Rosario]] started this initiative for the growing number of local bands who had been performing in the area for years but had not had the chance to play at the same event.\n*Fuertemusica: like Lebrancho Rock, this festival aims to encourage the local or emerging groups. It started in the same year. This festival is mainly for groups that are already known in the music world. It takes place in El Cotillo.\n*In the municipality of [[Betancuria]] (more specifically in the village of Vega de Rio Palmas) held every year the festivities in honor of the Virgen de la Pe\u00f1a, patron saint of the island of Fuerteventura, the most representative is the [[pilgrimage]] in which are involved people from all corners of the island. The holiday is celebrated on the third Saturday of September.\n\nFestival Internacional de Cometas/International [[Kite]] Festival is held on the second week of November each year centering on the Corralejo Beaches. It attracts kitefliers and kite surfers from all over Europe. It is popular because the winds are warm and constant and the beaches become filled with hundreds of colourful kites of all shapes and sizes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.laoliva.es/ver_evento.php?id_evento=16|title='XXIX Festival Internacional de Cometas 2016'|work=Ayuntamiento de La Oliva|accessdate=2016-03-03}}</ref>\n\n=== Auditoriums ===\n[[File:Ensayos de la Compa\u00f1\u00eda Nacional de Danza 2 en Fuerteventura.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Members of the National Dance Company in the [[Puerto del Rosario]] Auditorium on 25 July 2000.]]\nFuerteventura has three auditoriums.

These include:\n\n* The Antigua Windmill Craft Centre\n* The Salt Museum\n* The Atalayita Archeological Interpretation Centre\n\n=== Sculpture park ===\nIn addition to the museums, the capital [[Puerto del Rosario]] has an open-air sculpture park consisting of around 100 sculptures by different artists scattered across the city. Most of them were created for the International Symposium of Sculpture celebrated annually since 2001. During the festival, artists come from all over the world to erect their sculptures in the open air, in full view of passers by.\n\n==Main sights==\nSites of interest include [[Corralejo]] and El Jable to the north which are made up of fine sand [[dunes]] whilst the south is filled with long beaches and remote bays. The constant winds blowing onto the beaches provide a paradise for [[windsurfing]]. [[Surfing]] is common on the west and north coasts where there are large waves. Windsurfing is common around Corralejo and Playas de Sotavento and wave sailing (windsurfing on the waves) on the coast along the northern half of the island. El Cotillo is a small fishing village in the north-west of the Island famous for a very long beach to the south of the village and few very calm beaches to the north. The northern beaches frequented by snorkeling enthusiasts and sun worshippers alike are referred to as lakes by the locals. \n[[File:Shipwreck of the SS American Star on the shore of Fuerteventura.jpg|thumb|left|The wreck of ''[[SS American Star (1939)|American Star]]'' (SS ''America'') seen in July 2004 from land side.]]\nAt [[Cofete]] on the western side of Jand\u00eda a remote and imposing house - [[Villa Winter]] - looks out to sea across wide beaches. It was reputedly built by a Mr Winter on land given by [[Francisco Franco|Generalisimo Franco]].\n\nFor a time, the beaches were home to a popular accidental attraction. On 18 January 1994 the [[United States Lines]] [[ocean liner]] [[SS America (1940)|SS ''American Star'']] (former ''America'', USS ''West Point'', ''Australis'') was beached in Playa de Garcey during a severe storm. Within a year, she broke in two and later lost her stern. By 2007 the rest of the severely deteriorated ship had collapsed onto her port side, gradually keeling over further and almost completely submerged. By 2008-2012, most of the remains finally slipped below the surface.\n\n== Food ==\n[[File:Fuerteventura kaeserei.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Majorera cheese.]]\n\nThe cuisine is fairly basic due to the customs and climate conditions. They share this simplicity with the other Canary islands, and similarly to them, they use a large quantity of [[fish]]. They also use whatever they can grow in the near-barren land. This includes [[Canarian wrinkly potatoes|papas arrugadas]], a dish of wrinkled potatoes usually served with [[mojo (sauce)|mojo]], which is a hot pepper sauce or with [[puchero canario]], a meat stew.\n\nSeafood is prepared in many ways traditionally, such as pejines (salted fish),<ref>Little sun-dried salted fish roasted or burned in a dish with a little alcohol.</ref> jareas,<ref>[[Octopus]], [[gilt-head bream]] or other fish washed and placed in the sun to dry.</ref> or [[sancocho]] (a type of stew) made from fish, generally the [[grouper]],<ref>Groupers are a group of 20 genera in the subfamily Epinephelinae of perciformes. They have a robust body, with a large head resulting in globulous eyes and large mandibles.</ref> corvina or sama, boiled after salting, and served with mojo, potatoes, or [[gofio]] (a type of grain). People are also very keen on the [[mussel]]s and [[limpet]]s collected on the island's coasts.\n\nThey also use meat such as [[beef]] and [[pork]] to make different dishes or simply to for braising, but their main meat is [[goat meat|goat]], both from the kids and from the older animals. They eat the goat roasted or stewed. Goats are not only useful for their meat - the Fuerteventurans also use the [[milk]] to make the cheese [[majorero]], which has won many prizes. The majorero is mostly made of goats milk, and occasionally it is up to 15% [[Sheep|ewes]] milk. It is cured in [[pimento]] oil or gofio meal. Majorero and [[palmero cheese]] are the only two Canarian cheeses with [[Denominaci\u00f3n de Origen|protected denomination of origin]].\n\n== Sport ==\nMany sports are commonly played in Fuerteventura, both in the open air and in sports centres across the island.\n\n=== Native sports ===\nThese are the Canarian sports found on the island:\n\n==== Canarian wrestling ====\nThe wrestling takes place in a ring of sand called the ''terrero''. Inside it, the two contestants try to knock each other over. Fuerteventura has 14 terreros distributed through all the towns except Betancuria.\n\n* Antigua: Terrero de Antigua.\n* La Oliva: Terrero Venancio Guerra and Terrero de Villaverde.\n* P\u00e1jara: Terrero Miguel D\u00edaz La Lajita, Terrero de Morro Jable a Terrero de [[P\u00e1jara]].\n* Puerto del Rosario: Terrero de Casillas del Angel, Terrero Manuel Nieves, Terrero de Puerto Cabras, Terrero de Tef\u00eda a Terrero de Tetir.\n* Tuineje: Terrero de Gran Tarajal, Terrero de Tamasite, and Terrero Pedro S\u00e1nchez in Tarajalejo.\n\nThe island also has a school wrestling league organized by the council and a programme to promote this sport in clubs. Twelve wrestling schools participate in this, based in Antigua, Costa Calma, El Matorral, La Lajita, Lajares, Las Playitas, Morro Jable, Puerto del Rosario, Tef\u00eda, Tetir, Uni\u00f3n Sur and Villaverde.\n\n==== Juego del Palo ====\n[[File:Exhibici\u00f3n de Palo Canario en Pozo Negro Fuerteventura.jpg|thumb|200px|An exhibition during FEDETUR 2000, in Pozo Negro ([[Antigua (Las Palmas)|Antigua]]) on 23 September 2000]]\n[[Juego del Palo]] is a Canarian martial art which literally translates as ''game of the stick''. It is played by two players both armed with sticks. They aim to defeat each other without making contact with their opponent's body. The origin of this game is unclear. All we know is that it is based on a method of combat used by the precolonial Canarian people.\n\nFuerteventura has the following Palo clubs:<ref>[http://www.juegodelpalocanario.org/modules/cjaycontent/index.php?id=15 Relaci\u00f3n de clubes federados.] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070928152028/http://www.juegodelpalocanario.org/modules/cjaycontent/index.php?id=15 |date=28 September 2007 }} Fuente: [[Federaci\u00f3n del Juego del Palo Canario]]</ref>\n* Club-Escuela Dunas de Corralejo.\n* Club-Escuela Huriamen de Villaverde.\n* Club-Escuela Puerto Cabras.\n* Club-Escuela Sorinque de Gran Tarajal.\n\n==== Canarian boules ====\nThis is a similar game to the French [[P\u00e9tanque]] which is actually played very little on the island, although there are a few teams and courts. Basically the game consists of scoring points by throwing a ball to get it as near as possible to an object called a ''mingue'' or ''boliche''. It is played on a rectangular sand or earth pitch which is {{convert|18|to(-)|25|m|ft|1|abbr=off}} long and {{convert|3.5|to(-)|6|m|ft|1|abbr=off}} wide.\n\nhttp://www.playaboule.com/Simple_petanque_rules.aspx\n\n=== Watersports ===\nThe sea and climate conditions make the island the perfect place for a huge variety of watersports.\n\n==== Surfing, windsurfing and kitesurfing ====\n[[File:Corralejo Fuerteventura.jpg|thumb|200px|Windsurfing in Corralejo.]]\nMany types of surfing are popular on the island, including [[Surfing|traditional surfing]], [[windsurfing]] (where the board is propelled by a sail) and most recently [[kitesurfing]]. The island has many schools and courses dedicated to teaching these sports.\n\nThe sports where Fuerteventura has the most impact internationally are windsurfing and kitesurfing, mainly due to the International Windsurfing and Kiteboarding Championship. This has run since 1985 and is held at Playas de Sotavento in P\u00e1jara municipality. Many important wind and kitesurfing figures compete in this championship, such as the several-times world windsurfing champion [[Bj\u00f6rn Dunkerbeck]] and [[Gisela Pulido]], the very young kiteboarding champion from [[Tarifa]].\n\nMany Canarian windsurfers are on the Canarian Waveriders circuit, which has been based in [[Corralejo]] since 2005.\n\n==== Diving ====\nDiving schools are just as frequent as surfing ones, all around the coast of Fuerteventura. Unlike the other islands of the archipelago, Fuerteventura has a shelf which at some points goes up to {{convert|30|km|0|abbr=off}}, making it an ideal place to practice this sport.\n\nTwo of the most useful points for diving are the coast off [[Playa del Matorral]] in the South, and the zone between [[Lobos Island]] and Corralejo in the north. It is here in Corralejo that the International Sea and Submarine Photography Festival takes places, known as Fimarsub Corralejo - Lobos. During the festival there are beginners' lessons, professional dives, lessons in underwater photography, screenings and other events related to the sport.\n\n==== Swimming ====\nThere are many swimming pools on the island but the most obvious place to swim is in the open sea. There is an annual swim from Lobos Island to Fuerteventura, held every year since 1999. The event attracts amateur swimmers from all over the Canaries and Spain, and also swimming professionals such as [[David Meca]] and Maarten Van der Weijden, the paralympist Jes\u00fas Collado Alarc\u00f3n who won gold medals for 100m backstroke and butterfly in Athens 2004, and Xavi Torres Ramis, the paralympic champion in Barcelona '92, Sydney and Atlanta.\n\n==== Sailing ====\n[[File:Caleta de Fustes puerto deportivo Fuerteventura.jpg|thumb|200px|The harbour at Caleta de Fuste ([[Antigua (Las Palmas)|Antigua]])]]\nThe island holds competitions involving different types of boat, such as the [[lateen]] and the [[Optimist (dinghy)|Optimist]]. An interesting event is the Tour of Fuerteventura by Kayak, which is organised as a series of stages rather than a competition, and is an easy way to explore the island.\n\n==== Fishing ====\nThe most notable competition here is the Gran Tarajal Fishing Open.\n\n=== Other sports ===\nSince 2004 the Marcha Ciclotourista has been held in [[La Oliva]] and the Criterium Ciclista has been held in Corralejo (also part of the La Oliva municipality) since 2005. Participants include [[Euskaltel-Euskadi]], [[T-Mobile]] and a team from [[Orbea]]. These competitions have contributed to local interest in the sport and the first professional local team, the [[Fuerteventura-Canarias]], was formed, initially run by \u00d3scar Guerrero, director of [[Kaiku]], although they have not competed for the past few seasons.\n\nThere are various [[motocross]] circuits on the island, including ''Los Alares'' in Antigua and ''Isla de Fuerteventura'' in [[Puerto del Rosario]] municipality. They hold regular trials, some of which form part of the Canarian Regional Motocross Championship. Throughout the year there are gravel rally races. Two are part of the Canarian Dirt Rally Championship. These are the Antiguan Rally and the La Oliva Rally.\n\nThe island's main [[Association football|football]] clubs are [[CD Union Puerto]] and [[CD Cotillo]], who play in Group XII of the Spanish [[Tercera Divisi\u00f3n]].\n\nThe resort Playitas on the south coast is since around 2008 equipped with a {{convert|50|m|ft|abbr=off|adj=mid}} swimming pool and has become a destination for [[triathlon]] training camps for Europeans. An annual race called Challenge Fuerteventura is held there on the half ironman distance.\n\n== People ==\n[[File:Descubrimiento estatua Manuel Vel\u00e1zquez Cabrera.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Inauguration of the statue by [[Emiliano Hern\u00e1ndez]] in honour of [[Manuel Vel\u00e1zquez Cabrera]] on 08 November 2001.]]\n\n* [[Manuel Vel\u00e1zquez Cabrera]]: born in Tiscamanita in 1863, the politician and lawyer who created the island's council.\n* [[Juan Ismael]]: the painter, cartoonist and poet born in [[La Oliva]] in 1907, considered one of the great Canarian surrealists.\n* Eustaquio Gopar: born in [[Tuineje, Las Palmas|Tuineje]] in 1866. He was one of the Spanish soldiers involved in the [[Siege of Baler]] together with Major Rafael Alonso Mederos, who died of [[beri-beri]] during the siege. On his return Eustaquio became mayor over his native people. He held this post both during the republic and under Franco.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of volcanoes in Spain]]\n* {{portal-inline|Spain}}\n* {{portal-inline|Islands}}\n\n== References

The town was laid out in 1850 and named for [[Fairmount Park]] in [[Philadelphia]];<ref>{{cite book|last=Shouse|first=Cathy Duling|title=Fairmount|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b_MnHqUqgDcC&pg=PA7|year=2010|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=978-0-7385-8401-0|page=7}}</ref> it was formally incorporated in 1870.\n\nAfter a large deposit of natural gas was found in 1887, Fairmount became part of the [[Indiana Gas Boom]] and a center of the [[glass production|glass industry]] for the rest of the 19th century. Shortly after the depletion of the [[natural gas|gas]] in 1900 the automobile industry set up factories in the nearby large cities, and Fairmount became a bedroom community, restoring some of its lost prosperity.\n\n[[Image:Fairmount high school 2003.jpg|thumb|right|Abandoned Fairmount High School building in 2003.  The building was torn down in 2015.]]\nIn the 1940s, [[James Dean]] lived with an aunt and uncle, Ortense and Marcus Winslow on a farm north of Fairmount.  He attended Fairmount High School, graduating in 1949. After his death in 1955, Dean was buried in Park Cemetery. In 1996, a small Memorial Park north of the town's business district was dedicated in his memory with a bronze bust by Hollywood artist Kenneth Kendall.\n\nDuring the prosperity of the 1960s, Fairmount enjoyed a time of building with a new town hall, water works, post office and elementary school.  At the end of the decade the local school district merged with a neighboring one, forming the [[Madison County, Indiana|Madison]]-[[Grant County, Indiana|Grant]] [[Madison-Grant United School Corporation|united school district]].  A new high school was built for this district, and Fairmount High School became a middle school. When a new junior high school was opened in 1986, the Fairmount High School building was permanently closed.\n\nFairmount was hit hard by the recession of 1980\u20131982, which brought the permanent loss of factory jobs and the failure of many farms, but rebounded later in the decade. Fairmount is still relatively prosperous despite the ill fortunes of nearby industrial cities and a steady loss of population.\n\nIn September 1988, The James Dean Gallery opened in a restored Victorian House on North Main Street. Over the years the Museum Exhibit has been toured by nearly 200,000 visitors who come from around the world to visit the hometown of James Dean. Also in 1988, [[England|English]] musician [[Morrissey]] filmed the [[music video]] for his single \"[[Suedehead]]\", a song inspired by his lifelong admiration of Dean, in the town.\n\nThe annual James Dean Festival takes place during the last full weekend in September and includes a Custom & Hot Rod Car Show, The Grand Parade, Street Fair, Carnival Rides, Live Entertainment, a 1950s Dance Contest and the James Dean lookalike Contest.\n\nOn September 30 of each year there is a Memorial Service for James Dean at The Back Creek Friends Church, south of The Winslow Farm.\n\nThe [[Baldwin Addition Historic District]], [[Fairmount Commercial Historic District]], and [[J.W. Patterson House]] are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a|dateform=mdy}}</ref>\n\n==Education==\n[[Madison-Grant United School Corporation ]] operates public schools.\n\nSchools serving Fairmount:\n*Park Elementary School (Fairmount)\n*Madison-Grant Junior High School (''[[unincorporated area]]'')\n*[[Madison-Grant High School]] (''unincorporated area'')\n\nThe town has a lending library, the Fairmount Public Library.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.in.gov/library/files/countyindex13.pdf | title=Indiana public library directory | publisher=Indiana State Library | accessdate=7 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Notable people==\n*[[James Dean]], actor, was raised in Fairmount.

Most free verse self-evidently continues to observe a convention of the [[Line (poetry)|poetic line]] in some sense, at least in written representations, though retaining a potential degree of linkage. [[Donald Hall]] goes as far as to say that \"the ''form'' of free verse is as binding and as liberating as the ''form'' of a [[rondeau (poetry)|rondeau]]\",<ref>Donald Hall, in the essay 'Goatfoot, Milktongue, Twinbird' in the book of 0-472-40000-2.</ref> and [[T. S. Eliot]] wrote, \"No verse is free for the man who wants to do a good job\".<ref>in the essay \"The Music of Poetry\" Jackson (1 January 1942) ASIN B0032Q49RO</ref> \n\n[[Kenneth Allott]] the poet/critic said the adoption by some poets of [[vers libre]] arose from 'mere desire for novelty, the imitation of [[Walt Whitman|Whitman]], the study of [[English literature|Jacobean]] dramatic [[blank verse]], and the awareness of what French poets had already done to the [[French alexandrine|alexandrine]] in France'.<ref>Introductory Note by Kenneth Allott (ed) ''The Penguin Book of Contemporary Verse'', Penguin Books, Harmondsworth, England 1950</ref> The American critic [[John Livingston Lowes]] in 1916 observed 'Free verse may be written as very beautiful [[prose]]; prose may be written as very beautiful free verse. Which is which?'<ref>Lowes, Livingston John, ''Nation'' Feb 1916</ref>\n\nSome poets have considered free verse restrictive in its own way. In 1922 [[Robert Bridges]] voiced his reservations in the essay '[[Humdrum and Harum-Scarum]].' [[Robert Frost]] later remarked that writing free verse was like \"playing tennis without a net.\" <!-- How is Frost's comment a concurrence with 'restrictive'? Seems like a criticism of having no rules... --> [[William Carlos Williams]] said \"being an art form, verse cannot be free in the sense of having no limitations or guiding principles\".<ref>Free Verse, Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics, 2nd Ed, 1975</ref> [[Yvor Winters]], the poet/critic said \"the free verse that is really verse, the best that is, of [[William Carlos Williams|W.C. Williams]], [[H. D.]], [[Marianne Moore]], [[Wallace Stevens]], and [[Ezra Pound]] is the antithesis of free\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1937\">Primitivism and Decadence: A Study of American Experimental Poetry Arrow Editions, New York, 1937</ref>\n\n==Antecedents==\n\nAs the name ''vers libre'' suggests, this technique of using more irregular cadences is often said to be derived from the practices of 19th-century French poets such as [[Gustave Kahn]] and [[Jules Laforgue]] in his ''Derniers vers'' of 1890. Taupin, the USA based French poet/critic concluded that free verse and vers libre are not synonymous, since 'The French language tends to give equal weight to each spoken syllable, whereas English syllables vary in quantity according to whether stressed or unstressed'.<ref>Taupin, Rene, The Influence of French Symbolism on Modern American Poetry (1986),(trans William Pratt) Ams Studies in Modern Literature, {{ISBN|0-404-61579-1}}</ref>\n\nThe sort of cadencing that we now recognize in free verse can be traced back at least as far as the Hebrew psalmist poetry of the [[Bible]].<ref> Allen, Charles 'Cadenced Free Verse' , College English , vol 9, no 6 January 1948 </ref> By referring to [[s:Psalms|Psalms]] it is possible to argue that free verse in English first appeared in the 1380s in the [[John Wycliffe]] translation of the [[Psalms]] and was repeated in different form in most biblical translations ever since. [[Walt Whitman]], who based his long lines in \"Leaves of Grass\" on the phrasing of the King James Bible, influenced later American free verse practitioners, notably [[Allen Ginsberg]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} One form of free verse was employed by [[Christopher Smart]] in a long poem called [[Jubilate Agno]], written some time between 1759 and 1763 but not published until 1939.\n\nMany poets of the Victorian era experimented with free verse. [[Christina Rossetti]], [[Coventry Patmore]], and [[T. E. Brown]] all wrote examples of rhymed but unmetered verse. Poems such as [[W. E. Henley]]'s 'Discharged' (from his ''In Hospital'' sequence). Free verse in English was persuasively advocated by critic [[T. E. Hulme]] in his ''[[A Lecture on Modern Poetry]]'' (1908). Later in the preface to ''Some Imagist Poets'' 1916, he comments, \"Only the name is new, you will find something much like vers libre in [[John Dryden|Dryden]]'s ''Threnodia Augustalis''; a great deal of [[John Milton|Milton]]'s ''[[Samson Agonistes]]'', and the oldest in [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer's]] ''[[The House of Fame|House of Fame]]''.\"<ref>Preface to ''Some Imagist Poets'', Constable 1916</ref>\n\nIn France, a few pieces in [[Arthur Rimbaud]]'s [[prose poem]] collection [[Illuminations (poems)|Illuminations]] were arranged in manuscript in lines, rather than prose and in the Netherlands, [[tachtiger]] (i.e. member of 1880s generation of innovative poets) [[Frederik van Eeden]] employed the form at least once (in his poem \"Waterlelie\" [\"water lily\"]<ref>[http://4umi.com/vaneeden/waterlelie.htm De waterlelie]</ref>).\n\n[[Goethe]] (particularly in some early poems, such as \"[[Prometheus (Goethe)|Prometheus]]\") and [[H\u00f6lderlin]] used free verse occasionally, due in part to a misinterpretation of the meter used in [[Pindar]]'s poetry; in H\u00f6lderlin's case, he also continued to write unmetered poems after discovering this error.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ELuZzgnE81MC&pg=PR15 Michael Hamburger: ''Foreword''] in: Robert Marcellus Browning (ed.) : ''German poetry from 1750 to 1900'' (The German library, vol. 39), New York: The Continuum Publishing Company, 1984, p. XV, {{ISBN|0-8264-0282-8}}</ref> The German poet [[Heinrich Heine]] made an important contribution to the development of free verse with 22 poems, written in two-poem cycles called 'Die Nordsee' (The North Sea) (written 1825-1826).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wcnooASgpFIC&pg=PR17&lpg=PR17&dq=%22free+verse%22+heine+north+sea&source=bl&ots=EsVSRB10w-&sig=mbKzidTInCJXeSbDp4_2lx_WJaA&hl=en&ei=CUYDS7HcI-LOjAf8guGuAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CAoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22free%20verse%22%20heine%20north%20sea&f=false |title=Songs of Love and Grief: A Bilingual Anthology in the Verse Forms of the ... - Heinrich Heine - Google Books |work=Books.google.co.uk |date=22 November 1995 |accessdate=2013-04-23}}</ref> These were first published in ''Buch der Lieder'' (Book of Songs) in 1827.\n\n==Form and structure==\n\nAlthough free verse requires no meter, rhyme, or other traditional poetic techniques, a poet can still use them to create some sense of structure. A clear example of this can be found in [[Walt Whitman]]'s poems, where he repeats certain phrases and uses commas to create both a rhythm and structure. \n\nPattern and discipline is to be found in free verse: the internal pattern of sounds, the choice of exact words, and the effect of associations give free verse its beauty.<ref>Boulton, Marjories, ''Anatomy of Poetry'', Routledge&Kegan, London 1953</ref> With the [[Imagists]] free verse became a discipline and acquired status as a legitimate poetic form.<ref>Pratt, William. The Imagist Poem, Modern Poetry in Miniature (Story Line Press, 1963, expanded 2001). {{ISBN|1-58654-009-2}}.</ref> [[Herbert Read]] however, noting that 'the Imagist [[Ezra Pound]] gave free verse its musical structure to an extent that parodoxically it was no longer free'.<ref>Read, Herbert Ezra Pound, The Tenth Muse, Routledge & Kegan Paul, London 1957</ref>\n\nUnrestrained by traditional boundaries, [[Yvor Winters]] described this as \"attempts to widen experience by establishing 'abnormal' conventions\",<ref name=\"autogenerated1937\"/> the poet possesses more license to express, and has more control over the development of the poem. This can allow for a more spontaneous and individualized poetic art product.\n\nTechnically, free verse has been described as 'spaced prose', a mosaic of verse and prose experience.<ref>Patterson, William Morrison, 'Rhythm of Prose' (Preface 2nd edition ) Columbia University Press 1917 [https://archive.org/stream/rhythmofproseexp00pattiala/rhythmofproseexp00pattiala_djvu.txt]</ref>\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Blank verse]]\n*[[Cadence (poetry)|Cadence]]\n*[[Poetry analysis]]\n*[[Imagism]]\n*[[Vers libre]]\n\n==Further reading==\n\n*[[Charles O.

As South Africa's last head of state from the era of white-minority rule, he and his government dismantled the [[Apartheid in South Africa|apartheid]] system and introduced [[universal suffrage]]. Ideologically a [[conservatism|conservative]] and an [[Economic liberalism|economic liberal]], he led the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] from 1989 to 1997.\n\nBorn in [[Johannesburg]], [[Dominion|British Dominion]] of [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]], to an influential [[Afrikaners|Afrikaner]] family, de Klerk studied at [[Potchefstroom University]] before pursuing a legal career. Joining the National Party, to which he had family ties, he was elected to parliament and sat in the [[Dominant minority|white-minority government]] of [[P. W. Botha]], holding a succession of ministerial posts. As a minister, he supported and enforced apartheid, a system of [[racial segregation]] that privileged [[white South Africans]]. After Botha succumbed to ill health, in 1989 de Klerk replaced him, first as leader of the National Party and then as State President. Although observers expected him to continue Botha's defence of apartheid, de Klerk decided to end the policy. He was aware that growing ethnic animosity and violence was leading South Africa into a racial civil war. Amid this violence, the state security forces committed widespread human rights abuses and encouraged violence between [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] and [[Zulu people|Zulu]], although de Klerk later denied sanctioning such actions. He permitted [[Internal resistance to South African apartheid|anti-apartheid]] marches to take place, legalised a range of previously banned anti-apartheid political parties, and freed imprisoned anti-apartheid activists, including [[Nelson Mandela]]. He also dismantled South Africa's nuclear weapons program.\n\nDe Klerk negotiated with Mandela to fully dismantle apartheid and establish a transition to universal suffrage. In 1993, he publicly apologised for apartheid's harmful effects, although not for apartheid itself. He oversaw the [[South African general election, 1994|1994 multi-racial election]] in which Mandela led the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) to victory; the National Party took second place with 20% of the vote. After the election, de Klerk became a Deputy President in Mandela's ANC-led [[coalition government|coalition]], the [[Government of National Unity (South Africa)|Government of National Unity]]. In this position, he supported the government's liberal economic policies. De Klerk had desired a total amnesty for political crimes committed under apartheid and opposed the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] set up to investigate past [[Human rights in South Africa|human rights]] abuses by both pro and anti-apartheid groups. His working relationship with Mandela was strained, although he later spoke fondly of him. In May 1996, after the National Party objected to the [[Constitution of South Africa|new constitution]], de Klerk withdrew it from the coalition government; the party disbanded the following year and reformed as the [[New National Party (South Africa)|New National Party]]. In 1997, he retired from active politics and since then has lectured internationally.\n\nDe Klerk is a controversial figure. His role in dismantling apartheid and introducing universal suffrage to South Africa brought him international recognition and praise, including the [[F\u00e9lix Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny Peace Prize]] in 1991, the [[Prince of Asturias Award]] in 1992, and the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1993. Anti-apartheid figures criticised him for offering only a qualified apology for apartheid and for ignoring the human rights abuses carried out by his state security forces, while the white right-wing accused him of betraying South Africa's white minority by abandoning apartheid.\n\n==Early life and education==\n\n===Childhood: 1936\u20131954===\n\nF.

De Klerk also opened the way for the negotiations of the government with the anti-apartheid-opposition about a new constitution for the country. Nevertheless, he was accused by [[Anthony Sampson]] of complicity in the violence among the ANC, the [[Inkatha Freedom Party]] and elements of the security forces.

In 1997 he resigned the leadership of the National Party and retired from politics.\n\nIn 1993, de Klerk issued an apology for the actions of the apartheid government, stating that: \"It was not our intention to deprive people of their rights and to cause misery, but eventually apartheid led to just that. Insofar as that occurred we deeply regret it... Yes we are sorry\".{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=343}} Tutu urged for people to accept the apology, stating that \"saying sorry is not an easy thing to do... We should be magnanimous and accept it as a magnanimous act\", although was privately frustrated that de Klerk's apology had been qualified and had not gone so far as to call apartheid an intrinsically evil policy.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=343}}\n\n==Vice Presidency==\n\nDe Klerk had been unhappy that changes had been made to the inauguration ceremony, rendering it multi-religious rather than reflecting the newly elected leader's particular denomination.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=338}} When he was being sworn in, and the chief justice said \"So help me God\", de Klerk did not repeat this, instead stating, in Afrikaans: \"So help me the triune God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit\".{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=339}}\n\nMandela reappointed de Klerk's finance minister, [[Derek Keys]], and retained [[Chris Stals]], a former member of the Broederbond, as the head of the Central Bank.{{sfn|Sampson|2011|pp=514, 515}}\nDe Klerk supported the coalition's economic policies, stating that it \"accepted a broad framework of responsible economic policies\".{{sfn|Sampson|2011|p=514}}\n\nDe Klerk's working relationship with Mandela was often strained, with the former finding it difficult adjusting to the fact that he was no longer president.{{sfn|Sampson|2011|p=534}} De Klerk also felt that Mandela deliberately humiliated him, while Mandela found de Klerk to be needlessly provocative in cabinet.{{sfn|Sampson|2011|p=534}} One dispute occurred in September 1995, after Mandela gave a Johannesburg speech criticising the National Party. Angered, de Klerk avoided Mandela until the latter requested they meet; when they ran into each other, they publicly argued in the street. Mandela later expressed regret for their disagreement but did not apologise for his original comments.{{sfn|Sampson|2011|p=534}}\nDe Klerk was also having problems from within his own party, some of whose members claimed that he was neglecting the party while in the government.{{sfn|Sampson|2011|p=534}}\n\nMany in the National Party\u2014including many members of its executive committee\u2014were unhappy with the other parties agreed upon a new constitution in May 1996.{{sfn|Sampson|2011|p=534}} The party had wanted the constitution to guarantee that it would be represented in the government until 2004, although it did not do this.\nOn 9 May, de Klerk announced that the National Party would withdraw from the coalition government.{{sfn|Sampson|2011|p=534}} The decision shocked several of his six fellow Afrikaner cabinet colleagues; [[Pik Botha]], for example, was left without a job as a result.{{sfn|Sampson|2011|pp=534\u2013535}} [[Roelf Meyer]] reported feeling betrayed by de Klerk's act, while [[Leon Wessels]] thought that de Klerk had not tried hard enough to make the coalition work.{{sfn|Sampson|2011|p=535}} De Klerk announced that he would lead the National Party in vigorous opposition to Mandela's government, stating that he wanted to ensure \"a proper multi-party democracy, without which there may be a danger of South Africa lapsing into the African pattern of one-party states\".{{sfn|Sampson|2011|p=535}}\n\n===Truth and Reconciliation Commission===\n\n[[File:Desmond Tutu, 1986 Jan (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|The chair of the TRC, Desmond Tutu, was frustrated that de Klerk did not take responsibility for the actions of the state security services in the early 1990s]]\n\nIn de Klerk's view, his greatest defeat in the negotiations with Mandela had been his inability to secure a blanket amnesty for all those working for the government or state during the apartheid period.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=362}} \nDe Klerk was unhappy with the formation of the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] (TRC).{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=362}} He had hoped that the TRC would be made up of an equal number of individuals from both the old and new governments, as there had been in the [[Rettig Report|Chilean human rights commission]]. Instead, the TRC was designed to broadly reflect the wider diversity of South African society, and contained only two members who had explicitly supported apartheid, one a member of a right-wing group that had opposed de Klerk's National Party.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=362\u2013363}} De Klerk did not object to Tutu being selected as the TRC's chair for he regarded him as politically independent of Mandela's government, but he was upset that [[Alex Boraine]] had been selected as its deputy chair, later saying of Boraine: \"beneath an urbane and deceptively affable exterior beat the heart of a zealot and an inquisitor.\"{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=363}}\n\nDe Klerk appeared before the TRC hearing to testify for [[Vlakplaas]] commanders who were accused of having committed human rights abuses during the apartheid era. He acknowledged that security forces had resorted to \"unconventional strategies\" in dealing with anti-apartheid revolutionaries, but that \"within my knowledge and experience, they never included the authorisation of assassination, murder, torture, rape, assault or the like\".{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=363}} After further evidence of said abuses was produced by the commission, de Klerk stated that he found the revelations to be \"as shocking and as abhorrent as anybody else\" but insisted that he and other senior party members were not willing to accept responsibility for the \"criminal actions of a handful of operatives\", stating that their behaviour was \"not authorised [and] not intended\" by his government.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=363}} Given the widespread and systemic nature of the abuses that had taken place, as well as statements by security officers that their actions had been sanctioned by higher ranking figures, Tutu questioned how de Klerk and other government figures could not have been aware of them.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=363\u2013364}} Tutu had hoped that de Klerk or another senior white political figure from the apartheid era would openly accept responsibility for the human rights abuses, thereby allowing South Africa to move on; this was something that de Klerk would not do.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=364}}\n\nThe TRC found de Klerk guilty of being an accessory to gross violations of human rights on the basis that as State President he had been told that P. W. Botha had authorised the bombing of Khotso House but had not revealed this information to the Committee.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=364}} De Klerk challenged the TRC on this point, and it backed down.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=364}} When the final TRC report was released 2002, it made a more limited accusation: that de Klerk had failed to give full disclosure about events that took place during his Presidency and that in view of his knowledge about the Khotso House bombing, his statement that none of his colleagues had authorised gross human rights abuses was \"indefensible\".{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=364}}\nIn his later autobiography, de Klerk acknowledged that the TRC did significant damage to his public image.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=365}}\n\n==Later life==\nIn 1996, de Klerk was offered the Harper Fellowship at [[Yale Law School]].

In 2001, following the murder of his former wife, the manuscript of her own autobiography, ''A Place Where the Sun Shines Again'', was submitted to de Klerk, who urged the publishers to suppress a chapter dealing with his infidelity.<ref>{{cite web |author=Location Settings |url=http://www.news24.com/Entertainment/SouthAfrica/FW-balked-at-Marikes-book-20101003 |title=FW baulked at Marike's book |publisher=News24 |accessdate=11 December 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214170748/http://www.news24.com/Entertainment/SouthAfrica/FW-balked-at-Marikes-book-20101003 |archivedate=14 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn 1999, de Klerk established the pro-peace [[FW de Klerk Foundation]] of which he is the chairman. De Klerk is also chairman of the [[Global Leadership Foundation]], headquartered in London, which he set up in 2004, an organisation which works to support democratic leadership, prevent and resolve conflict through mediation and promote good governance in the form of democratic institutions, open markets, human rights and the rule of law. It does so by making available, discreetly and in confidence, the experience of former leaders to today's national leaders. It is a not-for-profit organisation composed of former heads of government and senior governmental and international organisation officials who work closely with heads of government on governance-related issues of concern to them.\n\nOn 3 December 2001, Marike de Klerk was found stabbed and strangled to death in her [[Cape Town]] flat. De Klerk, who was on a brief visit to [[Stockholm]], Sweden, to celebrate the 100-year anniversary of the Nobel Prize foundation, announced he would immediately return to mourn his dead ex-wife. The atrocity was reportedly condemned strongly by South African president [[Thabo Mbeki]] and [[Winnie Mandela]], among others, who openly spoke in favour of Marike de Klerk.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} On 6 December 21-year-old security guard Luyanda Mboniswa was arrested for the murder.

That same year, while giving an interview to US journalist [[Richard Stengel]], de Klerk was asked whether South Africa had turned out the way he envisioned it back in 1990. His response was:\n\n<blockquote>There are a number of imperfections in the new South Africa where I would have hoped that things would be better, but on balance I think we have basically achieved what we set out to achieve. And if I were to draw balance sheets on where South Africa stands now, I would say that the positive outweighs the negative by far. There is a tendency by commentators across the world to focus on the few negatives which are quite negative, like how are we handling AIDS, like our role vis-\u00e0-vis Zimbabwe.

However, the [[United States]] does not uniformly use this conversion ratio. Older ratios are in use for surveying purposes in some states, leading to variations in the length of the furlong of two parts per million, or about 0.4 millimetres ({{frac|64}} inch). This variation is too small to have practical consequences in most applications. Five furlongs are about 1.0 [[kilometre]] ({{convert|5/8|mi|5|disp=out}} is the exact value, according to the international conversion).\n\n==History==\nThe name ''furlong'' derives from the [[Old English language|Old English]] words ''{{lang|ang|furh}}'' (furrow) and ''{{lang|ang|lang}}'' (long). Dating back at least to early [[Anglo-Saxon]] times, it originally referred to the length of the furrow in one [[acre]] of a ploughed [[open-field system|open field]] (a medieval communal field which was divided into strips). The furlong (meaning furrow length) was the distance a team of oxen could plough without resting. This was standardised to be exactly 40 rods or 10 chains. The system of long furrows arose because turning a team of oxen pulling a heavy plough was difficult. This offset the drainage advantages of short furrows and meant furrows were made as long as possible. An acre is an area that is one furlong long and one [[Chain (unit)|chain]] (66 feet or 22 yards) wide. For this reason, the furlong was once also called an '''acre's length''',<ref> {{cite book |title=[[The Winter's Tale]] |first=William |last=Shakespeare |authorlink=William Shakespeare |edition=unabridged|publisher=Courier Dover|year=2000 |isbn=9780486411187| page=5|quotation=footnote 17: ''heat an acre''; run a heat or course of an acre's length, \"acre\" being used as a lineal measure, equivalent to a furlong.}} {{Shakecite|WT|M|1|2}}</ref> though in modern usage an area of one acre can be of any shape.

A furlong was forty rods, an acre four by 40 rods, or four rods by one furlong, and thus 160 square rods. At the time, the Saxons used the North German foot, which was 10 percent longer than the foot of today. When England changed to the shorter foot in the late 13th century, rods and furlongs remained unchanged, since property boundaries were already defined in rods and furlongs. The only thing that changed was the number of feet and yards in a rod or a furlong, and the number of square feet and square yards in an acre. The definition of the rod went from 15 old feet to {{frac|16|1|2}} new feet, or from 5 old yards to {{frac|5|1|2}} new yards. The furlong went from 600 old feet to 660 new feet, or from 200 old yards to 220 new yards. The acre went from 36,000 old square feet to 43,560 new square feet, or from 4,000 old square yards to 4,840 new square yards.<ref>{{cite book|last=Zupko|first=Ronald Edward|authorlink=Ronald Edward Zupko|title=British weights & measures: a history from antiquity to the seventeenth century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pWUgAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=26 November 2011|year=1977|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|isbn=978-0-299-07340-4|pages=10\u201311, 20\u201321}}</ref>\n\nThe furlong was historically viewed as being equivalent to the [[Ancient Roman units of measurement|Roman stade (''stadium'')]],<ref>Compare [[Josephus]], ''[[Antiquities of the Jews|Antiquities]]'' (15.11.3), who writes of the [[Temple Mount]] in Jerusalem that it was encompassed by a wall which measured one ''stadion'' ([[Greek language|Gr.]] \u03c3\u03c4\u03ac\u03b4\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd) to each angle, a word translated in English as \"furlong.\"</ref> which in turn derived from the [[Ancient Greek units of measurement|Greek system]]. For example, the [[King James Version|King James Bible]] uses the term \"furlong\" in place of the Greek ''stadion'', although more recent translations often use miles or kilometres in the main text and give the original numbers in footnotes.\n\nIn the Roman system, there were 625 feet to the ''stadium'', eight ''stadia'' to the mile, and three miles to the [[league (unit)|league]]. A league was considered to be the distance a man could walk in one hour, and the mile (from ''mille'', \"meaning thousand\") consisted of 1,000 ''passus'' (paces, five feet, or double-step).\n\nAfter the fall of the [[Roman Empire]], medieval Europe continued with the Roman system, which the people proceeded to diversify, leading to serious complications in trade, taxation, etc. Around the year 1300, by royal decree England standardized a long list of measures. Among the important units of distance and length at the time were the [[foot (unit)|foot]], [[yard]], [[rod (unit)|rod]] (or pole), furlong, and the [[mile]]. The rod was defined as {{frac|5|1|2}} yards or {{frac|16|1|2}} feet, and the mile was eight furlongs, so the definition of the furlong became 40 rods and that of the mile became 5,280 feet (eight furlongs/mile times 40 rods/furlong times {{frac|16|1|2}} feet/rod).\n\nA description from 1675 states, \"Dimensurator or Measuring Instrument whereof the mosts usual has been the Chain, and the common length for English Measures four Poles, as answering indifferently to the Englishs Mile and Acre, 10 such Chains in length making a Furlong, and 10 single square Chains an Acre, so that a square Mile contains 640 square Acres.\" \u2014John Ogilby, Britannia, 1675\n\nThe official use of the furlong was abolished in the United Kingdom under the [[Weights and Measures Acts of the United Kingdom|Weights and Measures Act]] 1985, an act that also abolished the official use of many other traditional units of measurement.\n\n==Use==\n[[File:Naypyitaw Tollbooth.jpg|right|thumb|Present-day use of furlongs on a highway sign near [[Yangon]]]]\n[[File:Milepost 358-6 on Yangon-Mandalay Expressway.JPG|right|thumb|Mileposts on the Yangon\u2013Mandalay Expressway use miles followed by furlongs]]\nIn [[Myanmar]], furlongs are currently used in conjunction with miles to indicate distances on highway signs.

This means that every block in a typical Chicago neighborhood (in either North/South or East/West direction but rarely both) is approximately one furlong in length. [[Salt Lake City]]'s blocks are also each a square furlong in the downtown area. The blocks become less regular in shape further from the center, but the numbering system (800 units to each mile) remains the same everywhere in [[Salt Lake County, Utah|Salt Lake County]]. Blocks in central [[Logan, Utah]], and in large sections of [[Phoenix, Arizona]], are similarly a square furlong in extent (eight to a mile, which explains the series of freeway exits: 19th Ave, 27th, 35th, 43rd, 51st, 59th ...).

The period of a waveform is the <math> T </math> for which the following equation is true:\n:<math> x(t) = x(t + T)\\text{ for all }t \\in \\mathbb{R} </math>\n\nWhere <math> x(t) </math> is the value of the waveform at <math> t </math>. This means that this equation and a definition of the waveforms values over any interval of length <math> T </math> is all that is required to describe the waveform completely.\n\nEvery waveform may be described using any multiple of this period. There exists a smallest period over which the function may be described completely and this period is the fundamental period. The fundamental frequency is defined as its reciprocal:\n\n:<math> f_0 = \\frac{1}{T}</math>\n\n[[File:F0leftclosed.gif|thumb|F0 Left End Closed]]Since the period is measured in units of time, then the units for frequency are 1/time. When the time units are seconds, the frequency is in <math>s^{-1}</math>, also known as [[Hertz]].[[File:F0rightclosed.gif|thumb|F0 Right End Closed]]\n\nFor a tube of length <math> L </math> with one end closed and the other end open the wavelength of the fundamental harmonic is <math> 4L</math>, as indicated by the first two animations. Hence,\n:<math>\\lambda_0 = 4L.</math>\n\nTherefore, using the relation\n:<math> \\lambda_0 = \\frac{v}{f_0}</math> ,\nwhere <math> v </math> is the speed of the wave, we can find the fundamental frequency in terms of the speed of the wave and the length of the tube:\n:<math> f_0 = \\frac{v}{4L}.</math>\n\n[[File:F0bothclosed.gif|thumb|F0 Both Ends Closed]][[File:F0bothopen.gif|thumb|F0 Both Ends Open]]If the ends of the same tube are now both closed or both opened as in the last two animations, the wavelength of the fundamental harmonic becomes <math> 2L </math>. By the same method as above, the fundamental frequency is found to be\n:<math> f_0 = \\frac{v}{2L}.</math>\n\nAt 20&nbsp;\u00b0C (68&nbsp;\u00b0F) the [[speed of sound]] in air is 343&nbsp;m/s (1129&nbsp;ft/s). This speed is [[Speed of sound#Practical formula for dry air|temperature dependent]] and increases at a rate of 0.6&nbsp;m/s for each degree Celsius increase in temperature (1.1&nbsp;ft/s for every increase of 1&nbsp;\u00b0F).\n\nThe velocity of a sound wave at different temperatures:-\n*v = 343.2&nbsp;m/s at 20&nbsp;\u00b0C\n*v = 331.3&nbsp;m/s at 0&nbsp;\u00b0C\n\n==In music==\nIn music, the fundamental is the musical [[pitch (music)|pitch]] of a note that is perceived as the lowest [[harmonic series (music)#Partial|partial]] present. The fundamental may be created by [[vibration]] over the full length of a string or air column, or a higher harmonic chosen by the player. The fundamental is one of the [[harmonic]]s. A harmonic is any member of the harmonic series, an ideal set of frequencies that are positive integer multiples of a common fundamental frequency. The reason a fundamental is also considered a harmonic is because it is 1 times itself.\n<ref>{{cite book | title = Music, Cognition, and Computerized Sound | author = [[John R.

Overtones are other sinusoidal components present at frequencies above the fundamental. All of the frequency components that make up the total waveform, including the fundamental and the overtones, are called partials. Together they form the harmonic series. Overtones which are perfect integer multiples of the fundamental are called harmonics. When an overtone is near to being harmonic, but not exact, it is sometimes called a harmonic partial, although they are often referred to simply as harmonics. Sometimes overtones are created that are not anywhere near a harmonic, and are just called partials or inharmonic overtones.\n\nThe fundamental frequency is considered the ''first harmonic'' and the ''first partial.''  The numbering of the partials and harmonics is then usually the same; the second partial is the second harmonic, etc.  But if there are inharmonic partials, the numbering no longer coincides. Overtones are numbered as they appear ''above'' the fundamental. So strictly speaking, the ''first'' overtone is the ''second'' partial (and usually the ''second'' harmonic). As this can result in confusion, only harmonics are usually referred to by their numbers, and overtones and partials are described by their relationships to those harmonics.\n\n== Mechanical systems ==\nConsider a spring, fixed at one end and having a mass attached to the other; this would be a single degree of freedom (SDoF) oscillator. Once set into motion, it will oscillate at its natural frequency. For a single degree of freedom oscillator, a system in which the motion can be described by a single coordinate, the natural frequency depends on two system properties: mass and stiffness; (providing the system is undamped). The radian frequency, ''\u03c9''<sub>n</sub>, can be found using the following equation:\n:<math> \\omega_\\mathrm{n}^2 = \\frac{k}{m} \\, </math>\n\nWhere:<br/>\n''k'' = [[stiffness]] of the spring<br/>\n''m'' = mass <br/>\n''\u03c9''<sub>n</sub> = radian frequency (radians per second)\n\nFrom the radian frequency, the natural frequency, ''f''<sub>n</sub>, can be found by simply dividing ''\u03c9''<sub>n</sub> by 2''\u03c0''. Without first finding the radian frequency, the natural frequency can be found directly using:\n:<math>f_\\mathrm{n} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}} \\,</math>\n\nWhere:<br/>\n''f''<sub>n</sub> = natural frequency in hertz (cycles/second)<br/>\n''k'' = stiffness of the spring (Newtons/meter or N/m)<br/>\n''m'' = mass(kg)  <br/>\nwhile doing the [[modal analysis]] of structures and mechanical equipment, the frequency of 1st mode is called fundamental frequency.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Greatest common divisor]]\n*[[Hertz]]\n*[[Missing fundamental]]\n*[[Natural frequency]]\n*[[Oscillation]]\n*[[Harmonic series (music)#Terminology]]\n*[[Pitch detection algorithm]]\n*[[Scale of harmonics]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Acoustics}}\n{{Strings (music)}}\n{{Timbre}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fundamental Frequency}}\n[[Category:Musical tuning]]\n[[Category:Acoustics]]\n[[Category:Fourier analysis]]", "sha1": "q5tmuwou3y26ema908rk7e3ckp3q56m"}}, {"title": "Fable", "ns": "0", "id": "11491", "revision": {"id": "865467778", "parentid": "865467759", "timestamp": "2018-10-24T04:12:40Z", "contributor": {"username": "ClueBot NG", "id": "13286072"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Reverting possible vandalism by [[Special:Contribs/68.190.224.153|68.190.224.153]] to version by Nihil novi.

Fables can be found in the literature of almost every country.\n\n===Aesopic or Aesop's fable===\nThe varying corpus denoted ''Aesopica'' or ''[[Aesop's Fables]]'' includes most of the best-known western fables, which are attributed to the [[legend]]ary [[Aesop]], supposed to have been a slave in [[ancient Greece]] around 550 BCE. When [[Babrius]] set down fables from the ''Aesopica'' in verse for a [[Hellenistic]] Prince \"Alexander,\" he expressly stated at the head of Book II that this type of \"myth\" that Aesop had introduced to the \"sons of the Hellenes\" had been an invention of \"Syrians\" from the time of \"[[Ninus|Ninos]]\" (personifying [[Nineveh]] to Greeks) and [[Belus (Assyrian)|Belos]] (\"ruler\").<ref>Burkert 1992:121</ref> [[Epicharmus of Kos]] and Phormis are reported as having been among the first to invent comic fables.<ref>P. W. Buckham, p. 245</ref> Many familiar fables of Aesop include \"[[The Crow and the Pitcher]]\", \"[[The Tortoise and the Hare]]\" and \"[[The Lion and the Mouse]]\". In ancient Greek and Roman education, the fable was the first of the ''[[progymnasmata]]''\u2014training exercises in prose composition and public speaking\u2014wherein students would be asked to learn fables, expand upon them, invent their own, and finally use them as persuasive examples in longer forensic or deliberative speeches. The need of instructors to teach, and students to learn, a wide range of fables as material for their declamations resulted in their being gathered together in collections, like those of Aesop.\n\n===Africa===\n[[Oral tradition|African oral culture]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/atim-oton/arits-fables-kids-series_b_1001656.html |author=Atim Oton |title=Reaching African Children Through Fables and Animation |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date=October 25, 2011 |accessdate=May 8, 2012}}</ref> has a rich story-telling tradition. As they have for thousands of years, people of all ages in Africa continue to interact with nature, including plants, animals and earthly structures such as rivers, plains and mountains. Grandparents enjoy enormous respect in African societies and fill the new role of story-telling during retirement years. Children and, to some extent, adults are mesmerized by good story-tellers when they become animated in their quest to tell a good fable.\n\n[[Joel Chandler Harris]] wrote African-American fables in the Southern context of slavery under the name of [[Uncle Remus]]. His stories of the animal characters Brer Rabbit, Brer Fox, and Brer Bear are modern examples of African-American story-telling, this though should not transcend critiques and controversies as to whether or not Uncle Remus was a racist or apologist for slavery. The Disney movie ''[[Song of the South]]'' introduced many of the stories to the public and others not familiar with the role that story-telling played in the life of cultures and groups without training in speaking, reading, writing, or the cultures to which they had been relocated to from world practices of capturing Africans and other indigenous populations to provide slave labor to colonized countries.\n\n===India===\nIndia has a rich tradition of fabulous novels, mostly explainable by the fact that the culture derives traditions and learns qualities from natural elements. Most of the gods are some form of animals with ideal qualities. Also hundreds of fables were composed in [[History of India|ancient India]] during the [[1st millennium BC|first millennium BCE]], often as [[Story within a story|stories within]] [[frame story|frame stories]]. Indian fables have a mixed cast of humans and animals. The dialogues are often longer than in fables of Aesop and often witty as the animals try to outwit one another by trickery and deceit. In Indian fables, man is not superior to the animals. The tales are often comical. The Indian fable adhered to the universally known traditions of the fable. The best examples of the fable in India are the Panchatantra and the [[Jataka tales]]. These included [[Vishnu Sarma]]'s ''[[Panchatantra]]'', the ''[[Hitopadesha]]'', ''[[Baital Pachisi|Vikram and The Vampire]]'', and [[Syntipas]]' ''[[Seven Wise Masters]]'', which were collections of fables that were later influential throughout the [[Old World]]. Ben E. Perry (compiler of the \"[[Perry Index]]\" of Aesop's fables) has argued controversially that some of the Buddhist ''Jataka tales'' and some of the fables in the ''Panchatantra'' may have been influenced by similar [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Near East]]ern ones.<ref>Ben E. Perry, \"Introduction\", p. xix, in ''Babrius and Phaedrus'' (1965)</ref> Earlier [[Indian epic poetry|Indian epics]] such as [[Krishna Dwaipayana Vyasa|Vyasa's]] ''[[Mahabharata]]'' and [[Valmiki]]'s ''[[Ramayana]]'' also contained fables within the main story, often as [[side story|side stories]] or [[back-story]]. The most famous folk stories from the Near East were the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'', also known as the ''Arabian Nights''.\n\n===Europe===\nFables had a further long tradition through the [[Middle Ages]], and became part of European high literature. During the 17th century, the [[France|French]] fabulist [[Jean de La Fontaine]] (1621\u20131695) saw the soul of the fable in the moral \u2014 a rule of behavior. Starting with the Aesopian pattern, La Fontaine set out to satirize the court, the church, the rising [[bourgeoisie]], indeed the entire human scene of his time.<ref>Translations of his 12 books of fables are available online at [http://oaks.nvg.org/fontaine.html oaks.nvg.org]</ref> La Fontaine's model was subsequently emulated by England's [[John Gay]] (1685\u20131732);<ref>His two collections of 1727 and 1738 are available in one volume on Google Books at [https://books.google.com/books?id=X_Y0AAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=john+gay+++%22fables%22&source=bl&ots=_ChY5dZunN&sig=5qBAeejDOY8U5EgxDr4Pgnw68ao&hl=en&ei=EcNNTLKfGpL24AbX5uCaDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7&ved=0CCsQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&q&f=false books.google.co.uk]</ref> Poland's [[Ignacy Krasicki]] (1735\u20131801);<ref>His ''Bajki przypowiesci'' (Fables & Parables, 1779) are available online at [http://literat.ug.edu.pl/ikbajk/index.htm ug.edu.pl]</ref> Italy's [[:it:Lorenzo Pignotti|Lorenzo Pignotti]] (1739\u20131812)<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6CSQZlaZjE0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=pignotti+++favola&source=bl&ots=n8Mlm8LQld&sig=ubnkrD47WARSbDJKUXgNCj7_Vgo&hl=en&ei=8DhNTP-rOt3NjAeEtLDYDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=His '&#39;Favole e Novelle'&#39; (1785) is available on Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=May 8, 2012}}</ref>{{Verify source|date=May 2012}} and [[:it:Giovanni Gherardo de Rossi|Giovanni Gherardo de Rossi]] (1754\u20131827);<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rKoTAAAAQAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=pignotti+++favola&source=gbs_similarbooks_s&cad=1#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=His '&#39;Favole'&#39; (1788) is available on Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=May 8, 2012}}</ref>{{Verify source|date=May 2012}} Serbia's [[Dositej Obradovi\u0107]] (1739\u20131811); Spain's [[F\u00e9lix Mar\u00eda de Samaniego]] (1745\u20131801)<ref>9 books of fables are available online in Spanish at [http://amediavoz.com/samaniego.htm amediavoz.com]</ref> and [[Tom\u00e1s de Iriarte y Oropesa]] (1750\u20131791);<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zr0DAAAAQAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Tom%C3%A1s+de+Iriarte+y+Oropesa+fabulas&source=bl&ots=WbHNxf22GV&sig=zrfOpn4x0K8bAykQBwrXmq_zHfQ&hl=en&ei=mElNTMGZO5mW4gbNyLCaDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CCUQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=His '&#39;Fabulas Literarias'&#39; are available on Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=May 8, 2012}}</ref>{{Verify source|date=May 2012}} France's [[Jean-Pierre Claris de Florian]] (1755\u201394);<ref>His five books of fables are available online in French at [http://www.shanaweb.net/florian/la-vie-de-florian.htm shanaweb.net] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612144726/http://shanaweb.net/florian/la-vie-de-florian.htm |date=2010-06-12 }}</ref> and Russia's [[Ivan Krylov]] (1769\u20131844).<ref>5 books of fables are available online in Russian at [http://www.friends-partners.org/friends/literature/19century/krylov2.html friends-partners.org]</ref>\n\n===Modern era===\nIn modern times, while the fable has been trivialized in children's books, it has also been fully adapted to modern adult literature. [[Felix Salten]]'s ''[[Bambi, A Life in the Woods|Bambi]]'' (1923) is a ''[[Bildungsroman]]'' \u2014 a story of a [[protagonist]]'s coming-of-age \u2014 cast in the form of a fable. [[James Thurber]] used the ancient fable style in his books ''[[Fables for Our Time and Famous Poems Illustrated|Fables for Our Time]]'' (1940) and ''[[Further Fables for Our Time]]'' (1956), and in his stories \"[[The Princess and the Tin Box]]\" in ''The Beast in Me and Other Animals'' (1948) and \"The Last Clock: A Fable for the Time, Such As It Is, of Man\" in ''Lanterns and Lances'' (1961). [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Reymont]]'s ''The Revolt'' (1922), a [[metaphor]] for the [[Bolshevik]] [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Revolution of 1917]], described a revolt by animals that take over their farm in order to introduce \"equality.\" [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Animal Farm]]'' (1945) similarly satirized [[Stalinist Communism]] in particular, and [[totalitarianism]] in general, in the guise of animal fable.\n\nIn the 21st century the Neapolitan writer Sabatino Scia is the author of more than two hundred fables that he describes as \u201cwestern protest fables.\u201d The characters are not only animals, but also things, beings and elements from nature. Scia\u2019s aim is the same as in the traditional fable, playing the role of revealer of human society. In Latin America, the brothers Juan and Victor Ataucuri Garcia have contributed to the resurgence of the fable. But they do so with a novel idea: use the fable as a means of dissemination of traditional literature of that place. In the book ''[http://www.childrenslibrary.org/icdl/BookPreview?bookid=atafabu_00510018&route=author_Spanish&lang=Spanish&msg&ilang=Spanish \"F\u00e1bulas Peruanas\"] published in 2003, they have collected myths, legends, beliefs of Andean and Amazonian Peru, to write as fables. The result has been an extraordinary work rich in regional nuances. Here we discover the relationship between man and his origin, with nature, with its history, its customs and beliefs then become norms and values.<ref>Juan y V\u00edctor Ataucuri Garc\u00eda, \"F\u00e1bulas Peruanas\", Gaviota Azul Editores, Lima, 2003 {{ISBN|9972-2561-0-3}}.</ref>\n\n==Fabulists==\n<gallery widths=150 heights=150 class=center>\nFile:Vel\u00e1zquez - Esopo (Museo del Prado, 1639-41).jpg|[[Aesop]], by [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez|Vel\u00e1zquez]]\nFile:Vyasa.jpg|[[Vyasa]]\nFile:Valmiki_Ramayana.jpg|[[Valmiki]]\nFile:Jean-de-la-fontaine.jpg|[[Jean de La Fontaine]]\nFile:Sullhan saba.jpg|[[Sulkhan-Saba Orbeliani]]\nFile:John Gay - Project Gutenberg eText 13790.jpg|[[John Gay]]\nFile:Christian F\u00fcrchtegott Gellert.jpg|[[Christian F\u00fcrchtegott Gellert]]\nFile:Lessing in blue.jpg|[[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]]\nFile:Ignacy Krasicki 111.PNG|[[Ignacy Krasicki]]\nFile:DositejObradovi\u0107.jpg|[[Dositej Obradovi\u0107]]\nFile:Samaniego.jpg|[[F\u00e9lix Mar\u00eda de Samaniego]]\nFile:Tomas de Iriarte Joaquin Inza.jpg|[[Tom\u00e1s de Iriarte y Oropesa]]\nFile:Jean-Pierre Claris de Florian.jpg|[[Jean-Pierre Claris de Florian]]\nFile:Ivan Krylov.jpg|[[Ivan Krylov]]\nFile:Andersen-hc.jpg|[[Hans Christian Andersen]]\nFile:Abierce.jpg|[[Ambrose Bierce]]\nFile:Joel Chandler Harris (\"Uncle Remus\").jpg|[[Joel Chandler Harris]]\nFile:Wladyslaw Reymont.jpg|[[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Reymont]]\nFile:Felix Salten 1910.jpg|[[Felix Salten]]\nFile:Don Marquis.jpg|[[Don Marquis]]\nFile:James Thurber NYWTS.jpg|[[James Thurber]]\nFile:GeoreOrwell.jpg|[[George Orwell]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Classic==\n*[[Aesop]] (mid-6th century [[BCE]]), author/s of ''[[Aesop's Fables]]''\n*[[Vishnu Sarma]] (ca. 200 [[BCE]]), author of the [[anthropomorphic]] political treatise and fable collection, the ''[[Panchatantra]]''\n*[[Bidpai]] (ca. 200 [[BCE]]), author of [[Sanskrit]] ([[Hindu]]) and [[Pali]] ([[Buddhist]]) animal fables in verse and prose, sometimes derived from [[Jataka tales]]\n*[[Syntipas]] (ca. 100 [[BCE]]), [[India]]n [[philosopher]], reputed author of a collection of tales known in [[Europe]] as ''[[Seven Wise Masters|The Story of the Seven Wise Masters]]''\n*[[Gaius Julius Hyginus]] (Hyginus, [[Latin]] author, native of [[Spain]] or [[Alexandria]], ca. 64 BCE \u2013 17 CE), author of ''Fabulae''\n*[[Phaedrus (fabulist)|Phaedrus]] (15 BCE \u2013 50 CE), [[Roman Republic|Roman]] fabulist, by birth a [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonian]]\n*[[Nizami Ganjavi]] ([[Persia]]n, 1141\u20131209)\n*[[Walter of England]] (12th century), [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] poet, published ''Aesop's Fables'' in [[distich]]s c. 1175\n*[[Marie de France]] (12th century)\n*[[Rumi|Jal\u0101l ad-D\u012bn Muhammad Balkh\u012b]] ([[Persia]]n, 1207\u201373)\n*[[Vardan Aygektsi]] (died 1250), Armenian priest and fabulist\n*[[Berechiah ha-Nakdan]] (Berechiah the Punctuator, or [[Linguist|Grammarian]], 13th century), author of [[Jewish]] fables adapted from [[Aesop]]'s Fables\n*[[Robert Henryson]] ([[Scotland|Scottish]], 15th century), author of ''[[The Morall Fabillis of Esope the Phrygian]]''\n*[[Leonardo da Vinci]] ([[Italy|Italian]], 1452\u20131519)\n*[[Biernat of Lublin]] ([[Poland|Polish]], 1465?

The two long bones of the lower leg, the [[tibia]] and [[fibula]], are connected to the top of the talus to form the [[ankle]]. Connected to the talus at the [[subtalar joint]], the calcaneus, the largest bone of the foot, is cushioned underneath by a layer of fat.<ref name=\"Podiatry-Channel\" />\n\nThe five irregular bones of the ''midfoot'', the [[Cuboid bone|cuboid]], [[Navicular bone|navicular]], and three [[Cuneiform (anatomy)|cuneiform]] bones, form the [[arches of the foot]] which serves as a shock absorber. The midfoot is connected to the hind- and fore-foot by muscles and the [[plantar fascia]].<ref name=\"Podiatry-Channel\" />\n\nThe ''forefoot'' is composed of five toes and the corresponding five proximal long bones forming the [[metatarsus]]. Similar to the fingers of the hand, the bones of the toes are called [[Phalanx bones|phalanges]] and the [[big toe]] has two phalanges while the other four toes have three phalanges each. The joints between the phalanges are called [[interphalangeal articulations of foot|interphalangeal]] and those between the metatarsus and phalanges are called [[metatarsophalangeal joint|metatarsophalangeal]] (MTP).<ref name=\"Podiatry-Channel\" />\n\n{{anchor|dorsum}}\nBoth the midfoot and forefoot constitute the ''dorsum'' (the area facing upwards while standing) and the ''planum'' (the area facing downwards while standing).\n\n{{anchor|instep}}\n\nThe ''instep'' is the arched part of the top of the foot between the toes and the ankle.\n\n=== Bones ===\n[[File:Blausen 0411 FootAnatomy.png|thumb|upright|Illustration of bones in lower leg and foot.]]\n\n* [[tibia]], [[fibula]]\n* [[Tarsus (skeleton)|tarsus]] (7): [[Talus bone|talus]], [[calcaneus]], [[Cuneiform (anatomy)|cuneiformes]] (3), [[Cuboid bone|cuboid]], and [[Navicular bone|navicular]]\n* [[metatarsus]] (5): [[First metatarsal bone|first]], [[Second metatarsal bone|second]], [[Third metatarsal bone|third]], [[Fourth metatarsal bone|fourth]], and [[fifth metatarsal bone]]\n* [[Phalanges of the foot|phalanges]] (14)\n\nThere can be many [[sesamoid bone]]s near the metatarsophalangeal joints, although they are only regularly present in the distal portion of the [[first metatarsal bone]].<ref name=\"Platzer-220\">Platzer 2004, p. 220</ref>\n\n=== Arches ===\n{{Main|Arches of the foot}}\nThe human foot has two [[Anatomical terms of location|longitudinal]] arches and a transverse arch maintained by the interlocking shapes of the foot bones, strong ligaments, and pulling muscles during activity. The slight mobility of these arches when weight is applied to and removed from the foot makes walking and running more economical in terms of energy. As can be examined in a footprint, the medial longitudinal arch curves above the ground. This arch stretches from the heel bone over the \"keystone\" ankle bone to the three medial metatarsals. In contrast, the lateral longitudinal arch is very low. With the cuboid serving as its keystone, it redistributes part of the weight to the calcaneus and the distal end of the fifth metatarsal. The two longitudinal arches serve as pillars for the transverse arch which run obliquely across the tarsometatarsal joints. Excessive strain on the tendons and ligaments of the feet can result in fallen arches or [[flat feet]].<ref name=\"Marieb-Hoehn-244\">Mareb-Hoehn 2007, pp. 244\u201345</ref>\n\n=== Muscles ===\nThe muscles acting on the foot can be classified into extrinsic muscles, those originating on the anterior or posterior aspect of the lower leg, and intrinsic muscles, originating on the dorsal (top) or plantar (base) aspects of the foot.\n\n==== Extrinsic ====\n[[File:Gray437.png|thumb|80px|Anterior leg muscles.]]\nAll muscles originating on the lower leg except the [[popliteus muscle]] are attached to the bones of the foot. The tibia and fibula and the interosseous membrane separate these muscles into anterior and posterior groups, in their turn subdivided into subgroups and layers.\n<ref name=\"Platzer-256\">Platzer 2004, p. 256</ref>\n\n''Anterior group''\n\n''Extensor group'': [[Tibialis anterior muscle|tibialis anterior]] originates on the proximal half of the tibia and the interosseous membrane and is inserted near the [[tarsometatarsal joint]] of the first digit. In the non-weight-bearing leg tibialis anterior flexes the foot dorsally and lift its medial edge ([[supination]]). In the weight-bearing leg it brings the leg towards the back of the foot, like in rapid walking. [[Extensor digitorum longus muscle|Extensor digitorum longus]] arises on the lateral tibial condyle and along the fibula to be inserted on the second to fifth digits and proximally on the fifth metatarsal. The extensor digitorum longus acts similar to the tibialis anterior except that it also dorsiflexes the digits. [[Extensor hallucis longus muscle|Extensor hallucis longus]] originates medially on the fibula and is inserted on the first digit. As the name implies it dorsiflexes the big toe and also acts on the ankle in the unstressed leg. In the weight-bearing leg it acts similar to the tibialis anterior.\n<ref name=\"Platzer-258\">Platzer 2004, p. 258</ref>\n\n''Peroneal group'': [[Peroneus longus muscle|peroneus longus]] arises on the proximal aspect of the fibula and [[Peroneus brevis muscle|peroneus brevis]] below it on the same bone. Together, their tendons pass behind the lateral [[malleolus]]. Distally, peroneus longus crosses the plantar side of the foot to reach its insertion on the first tarsometatarsal joint, while peroneus brevis reaches the proximal part of the fifth metatarsal. These two muscles are the strongest pronators and aid in plantar flexion. Longus also acts like a bowstring that braces the transverse arch of the foot.\n<ref name=\"Platzer-260\">Platzer 2004, p. 260</ref>\n\n{{double image|right|Gray438.png|100|Gray439.png|80|Deep and superficial layers of posterior leg muscles}}\n''Posterior group''\n\nThe ''superficial layer'' of posterior leg muscles is formed by the [[triceps surae]] and the [[Plantaris muscle|plantaris]]. The triceps surae consists of the [[Soleus muscle|soleus]] and the two heads of the [[Gastrocnemius muscle|gastrocnemius]]. The heads of gastrocnemius arise on the [[femur]], proximal to the condyles, and soleus arises on the proximal dorsal parts of the tibia and fibula. The tendons of these muscles merge to be inserted onto the calcaneus as the [[Achilles tendon]]. Plantaris originates on the femur proximal to the lateral head of the gastrocnemius and its long tendon is embedded medially into the Achilles tendon. The triceps surae is the primary plantar flexor and its strength becomes most obvious during ballet dancing. It is fully activated only with the knee extended because the gastrocnemius is shortened during knee flexion. During walking it not only lifts the heel, but also flexes the knee, assisted by the plantaris.<ref name=\"Platzer-262\">Platzer 2004, p. 262</ref>\n\nIn the ''deep layer'' of posterior muscles [[Tibialis posterior muscle|tibialis posterior]] arises proximally on the back of the interosseous membrane and adjoining bones and divides into two parts in the sole of the foot to attach to the tarsus. In the non-weight-bearing leg, it produces plantar flexion and supination, and, in the weight-bearing leg, it proximates the heel to the calf. [[Flexor hallucis longus muscle|flexor hallucis longus]] arises on the back of the fibula (i.e. on the lateral side), and its relatively thick muscle belly extends distally down to the [[flexor retinaculum of foot|flexor retinaculum]] where it passes over to the medial side to stretch across the sole to the distal phalanx of the first digit. The [[Popliteus muscle|popliteus]] is also part of this group, but, with its oblique course across the back of the knee, does not act on the foot.\n<ref name=\"Platzer-264\">Platzer 2004, p. 264</ref>\n\n==== Intrinsic ====\nOn the ''back'' (top) ''of the foot'', the tendons of [[Extensor digitorum brevis muscle|extensor digitorum brevis]] and [[Extensor hallucis brevis muscle|extensor hallucis brevis]] lie deep to the system of long extrinsic extensor tendons. They both arise on the calcaneus and extend into the dorsal [[aponeurosis]] of digits one to four, just beyond the penultimate joints. They act to dorsiflex the digits.\n<ref name=\"Platzer-268\">Platzer 2004, p. 268</ref>\n\n{{triple image|right|Gray443.png|83|Gray444.png|91|Gray445.png|100|Plantar aspects of foot, varying depths (superficial to deep)}}\n\nSimilar to the intrinsic muscles of the hand, there are three groups of muscles in the ''sole of foot'', those of the first and last digits, and a central group:\n\n''Muscles of the [[Hallux|big toe]]'': [[Abductor hallucis muscle|abductor hallucis]] stretches medially along the border of the sole, from the calcaneus to the first digit. Below its tendon, the tendons of the long flexors pass through the [[Tarsal tunnel|tarsal canal]]. It is an abductor and a weak flexor, and also helps maintain the arch of the foot. [[Flexor hallucis brevis muscle|flexor hallucis brevis]] arises on the medial cuneiform bone and related ligaments and tendons. An important plantar flexor, it is crucial for ballet dancing. Both these muscles are inserted with two heads proximally and distally to the first metatarsophalangeal joint. [[Adductor hallucis muscle|Adductor hallucis]] is part of this group, though it originally formed a separate system (see [[contrahens]].) It has two heads, the oblique head originating obliquely across the central part of the midfoot, and the transverse head originating near the metatarsophalangeal joints of digits five to three. Both heads are inserted into the lateral sesamoid bone of the first digit. Adductor hallucis acts as a tensor of the plantar arches and also adducts the big toe and then might plantar flex the proximal phalanx.\n<ref name=\"Platzer-270\">Platzer 2004, pp. 270\u201372</ref>\n\n''Muscles of the [[Fifth toe|little toe]]'': Stretching laterally from the calcaneus to the proximal phalanx of the fifth digit, [[Abductor digiti minimi muscle (foot)|abductor digiti minimi]] form the lateral margin of the foot and is the largest of the muscles of the fifth digit. Arising from the base of the fifth metatarsal, [[flexor digiti minimi brevis muscle (foot)|flexor digiti minimi]] is inserted together with abductor on the first phalanx. Often absent, [[Opponens digiti minimi muscle|opponens digiti minimi]] originates near the cuboid bone and is inserted on the fifth metatarsal bone. These three muscles act to support the arch of the foot and to plantar flex the fifth digit.\n<ref name=\"Platzer-272\">Platzer 2004, p. 272</ref>\n\n{{double image|right|Gray446.png|100|Gray447.png|100|Central muscles of foot}}\n''Central muscle group'': The four [[Lumbrical muscle (foot)|lumbricals]] arise on the medial side of the tendons of flexor digitorum longus and are inserted on the medial margins of the proximal phalanges. [[Quadratus plantae muscle|Quadratus plantae]] originates with two slips from the lateral and medial margins of the calcaneus and inserts into the lateral margin of the flexor digitorum tendon. It is also known as flexor accessorius. [[Flexor digitorum brevis muscle|Flexor digitorum brevis]] arise inferiorly on the calcaneus and its three tendons are inserted into the middle phalanges of digits two to four (sometimes also the fifth digit). These tendons divide before their insertions and the tendons of flexor digitorum longus pass through these divisions. Flexor digitorum brevis flexes the middle phalanges. It is occasionally absent. Between the toes, the [[Dorsal interossei muscles (foot)|dorsal]] and [[Plantar interossei muscles|plantar interossei]] stretch from the metatarsals to the proximal phalanges of digits two to five. The plantar interossei adducts and the dorsal interossei abducts these digits and are also plantar flexors at the metatarsophalangeal joints.\n<ref name=\"Platzer-274\">Platzer 2004, p. 274</ref>\n\n==Clinical significance==\n{{Main|Diseases of the foot}}\nDue to their position and function, feet are exposed to a [[List of disorders of foot and ankle|variety]] of potential [[infection]]s and [[injuries]], including [[athlete's foot]], [[bunion]]s, [[Ingrown nail|ingrown toenails]], [[Morton's neuroma]], [[plantar fasciitis]], [[plantar wart]]s and [[stress fracture]]s. In addition, there are several [[genetic disorder]]s that can affect the shape and function of the feet, including a [[club foot]] or [[flat feet]].\n\nThis leaves humans more vulnerable to medical problems that are caused by poor leg and foot alignments. Also, the wearing of shoes, sneakers and boots can impede proper alignment and movement within the ankle and foot. For example, [[High-heeled footwear]] are known to throw off the [[neutral spine|natural weight balance]] (this can also affect the lower back). For the sake of posture, flat soles with no heels are advised.\n\nA [[physician|doctor]] who specializes in the treatment of the feet practices [[podiatry]] and is called a podiatrist. A [[pedorthist]] specializes in the use and modification of footwear to treat problems related to the lower limbs.\n\n{{anchor|fracture}}<!--\"Foot fracture\" redirects here-->\n[[Bone fracture|Fracture]]s of the foot include:\n*[[Lisfranc fracture]]&nbsp;\u2013 in which one or all of the [[metatarsal]]s are displaced from the [[Tarsus (skeleton)|tarsus]]<ref>[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Lisfranc%27s+fracture TheFreeDictionary > Lisfranc's fracture] Citing: Mosby's Medical Dictionary, 8th edition. 2009</ref>\n*[[Jones fracture]]&nbsp;\u2013 a fracture of the [[fifth metatarsal]]\n*[[March fracture]]&nbsp;\u2013 a fracture of the distal third of one of the metatarsals occurring because of recurrent stress\n*[[Calcaneal fracture]]\n\n{{anchor|sweat}}<!--\"Foot sweat\" redirects here-->\nFoot [[sweat]] is the major cause of [[foot odor]]. Sweat itself is odorless, but it creates a beneficial environment for certain bacteria to grow and produce bad-smelling substances.\n\n==Pronation==\n{{main|Pronation of the foot}}\nIn anatomy, [[pronation]] is a rotational movement of the forearm (at the radioulnar joint) or foot (at the subtalar and talocalcaneonavicular joints). Pronation of the foot refers to how the body distributes weight as it cycles through the [[gait]]. During the gait cycle the foot can pronate in many different ways based on rearfoot and forefoot function. Types of pronation include neutral pronation,  underpronation (supination), and overpronation.\n\n;Neutral pronation\nAn individual who neutrally pronates initially strikes the ground on the [[Human Anatomical Terms#Anatomical directions|lateral]] side of the [[heel]]. As the individual transfers weight from the heel to the [[metatarsus]], the foot will roll in a [[Human Anatomical Terms#Anatomical directions|medial]] direction, such that the weight is distributed evenly across the metatarsus. In this stage of the gait, the [[knee]] will generally, but not always, track directly over the [[hallux]].\n\nThis rolling inwards motion as the foot progresses from heel to toe is the way that the body naturally absorbs shock. Neutral pronation is the most ideal, efficient type of gait when using a [[heel strike (gait)|heel strike]] gait; in a forefoot strike, the body absorbs shock instead via flexation of the foot.\n\n;Overpronation\nAs with a neutral pronator, an individual who overpronates initially strikes the ground on the lateral side of the heel. As the individual transfers weight from the heel to the metatarsus, however, the foot will roll too far in a medial direction, such that the weight is distributed unevenly across the metatarsus, with excessive weight borne on the [[hallux]]. In this stage of the gait, the knee will generally, but not always, track inwards.\n\nAn overpronator does not absorb shock efficiently. Imagine someone jumping onto a diving board, but the board is so flimsy that when it is struck, it bends and allows the person to plunge straight down into the water instead of back into the air. Similarly, an overpronator's arches will collapse, or the ankles will roll inwards (or a combination of the two) as they cycle through the gait. An individual whose bone structure involves [[external rotation]] at the [[hip]], knee, or [[ankle]] will be more likely to overpronate than one whose bone structure has [[internal rotation]] or central alignment. An individual who overpronates tends to wear down their running shoes on the medial (inside) side of the shoe towards the toe area.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.runnersworld.com/running-shoes/overpronation-explained?page=single | work = Runner's World | date = 21 September 2001 | title = Overpronation, Explained | accessdate = 28 December 2012 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130924213417/http://www.runnersworld.com/running-shoes/overpronation-explained?page=single | archivedate = 24 September 2013 | df =  }}</ref>\n\nWhen choosing a running or walking shoe, a person with overpronation can choose shoes that have good inside support\u2014usually by strong material at the inside sole and arch of the shoe.  It is usually visible.  The inside support area is marked by strong greyish material to support the weight when a person lands on the outside foot and then roll onto the inside foot.\n\n;Underpronation (supination)\n\n[[File:Underpronation.jpg|thumb|Underpronation of foot]]\nAn individual who underpronates also initially strikes the ground on the lateral side of the heel. As the individual transfers weight from the heel to the metatarsus, the foot will not roll far enough in a medial direction. The weight is distributed unevenly across the metatarsus, with excessive weight borne on the [[fifth metatarsal]], towards the lateral side of the foot. In this stage of the gait, the knee will generally, but not always, track laterally of the [[hallux]].\n\nLike an overpronator, an underpronator does not absorb shock efficiently&nbsp;\u2013 but for the opposite reason. The underpronated foot is like a diving board that, instead of failing to spring someone in the air because it is too flimsy, fails to do so because it is too rigid. There is virtually no give. An underpronator's arches or ankles don't experience much motion as they cycle through the gait. An individual whose bone structure involves [[internal rotation]] at the hip, knee, or ankle will be more likely to underpronate than one whose bone structure has external rotation or central alignment. Usually&nbsp;\u2013 but not always&nbsp;\u2013 those who are [[bow-legged]] tend to underpronate.{{Citation needed|reason=some sources say instead that those who are bow-legged tend to overpronate|date=November 2013}} An individual who underpronates tends to wear down their running shoes on the lateral (outside) side of the shoe towards the rear of the shoe in the heel area.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.runnersworld.com/running-shoes/supination-explained?page=single | work = Runner's World | date = 21 September 2001 | title = Supination, Explained | accessdate = 28 December 2012 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130917160412/http://www.runnersworld.com/running-shoes/supination-explained?page=single | archivedate = 17 September 2013 | df =  }}</ref>\n\n==Society and culture==\nHumans usually wear [[shoe]]s or similar footwear for protection from hazards when walking outside.

A hard foot is called a [[hoof]]. Depending on style of locomotion, animals can be classified as [[plantigrade]] (sole walking), [[digitigrade]] (toe walking), or [[unguligrade]] (nail walking).\n\nThe metatarsals are the bones that make up the main part of the foot in humans, and part of the leg in large animals or paw in smaller animals. The number of metatarsals are directly related to the mode of locomotion with many larger animals having their digits reduced to two ([[elk]], [[cow]], [[sheep]]) or one ([[horse]]). The metatarsal bones of feet and paws are tightly grouped compared to, most notably, the human hand where the thumb metacarpal diverges from the rest of the metacarpus.<ref name=\"France-537\">France 2008, p. 537</ref>\n\n==Metaphorical and cultural usage==\n[[File:Study of a pair of feet crossed at the ankles RMG PY5986.tiff|thumb|Study of a pair of feet crossed, 1847, by Margaret Louisa Herschel, daughter of [[John Herschel]], from the [[Royal Museums Greenwich]]]]\nThe word \"foot\" is used to refer to a \"...linear measure was in Old English (the exact length has varied over time), this being considered the length of a man's foot; a unit of measure used widely and anciently.

construction ==\n[[File:Swiss Civil Defense Bunker (15710856390).jpg|thumb|Door of a public fallout shelter in Switzerland (2014).]]\n[[File:Big german fire door 1.png|thumb|Large fire door, sealing a fallout and air raid shelter inside the basement parking garage of a hotel in Germany.]]\n\n=== Shielding ===\nA basic fallout shelter consists of shields that reduce gamma ray exposure by a factor of 1000. The required shielding can be accomplished with 10 times the [[Radiation protection#Shielding design|thickness]] of any quantity of material capable of cutting gamma ray exposure in half. Shields that reduce gamma ray intensity by 50% (1/2) include 1&nbsp;cm (0.4&nbsp;inch) of lead, 6&nbsp;cm (2.4&nbsp;inches) of concrete, 9&nbsp;cm (3.6&nbsp;inches) of packed earth or 150&nbsp;m (500&nbsp;ft) of air. When multiple thicknesses are built, the shielding multiplies. Thus, a practical fallout shield is ten halving-thicknesses of packed earth, reducing gamma rays by approximately 1024 times (2<sup>10</sup>).<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.derose.net/steve/guides/emergency/hardened.html|title=Halving-thickness for various materials|publisher=\"The Compass DeRose Guide to Emergency Preparedness&nbsp;\u2013 Hardened Shelters\"}}</ref>\n\nUsually, an expedient purpose-built fallout shelter is a trench; with a strong roof buried by 1&nbsp;m (3&nbsp;ft) of earth. The two ends of the trench have ramps or entrances at right angles to the trench, so that gamma rays cannot enter (they can travel only in straight lines). To make the overburden waterproof (in case of rain), a plastic sheet may be buried a few inches below the surface and held down with rocks or bricks.<ref name=NWSS6>{{cite book|last=Kearny|first=Cresson H|title=Nuclear War Survival Skills|year=1986|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|location=Oak Ridge, TN|isbn=0-942487-01-X|pages=37\u201345|url=http://www.oism.org/nwss/s73p916.htm|quote=\"The 3-foot thickness of earth shown (or a 2-foot thickness of concrete) will provide an effective barrier, attenuating (absorbing) about 99.9%, of all gamma rays from fallout.\" \"A right-angle turn, either from a vertical or horizontal entry, causes a reduction of about 90%.\" \"...a large piece of 4-mil-thick polyethylene was placed over the mound.

The flaps open in one direction and close in the other, pumping air. (This is a [[Kearny air pump]], or KAP, named after the inventor, [[Cresson Kearny]])\n\nUnfiltered air is safe, since the most dangerous fallout has the consistency of sand or finely ground pumice.<ref name=NWSS7/> Such large particles are not easily ingested into the soft tissues of the body, so extensive filters are not required. Any exposure to fine dust is far less hazardous than exposure to the fallout outside the shelter. Dust fine enough to pass the entrance will probably pass through the shelter.<ref name=NWSS7>{{cite book|last=Kearny|first=Cresson H|title=Nuclear War Survival Skills |year= 1986|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|location=Oak Ridge, TN|isbn=0-942487-01-X |pages=51\u201356 |url=http://www.oism.org/nwss/s73p917.htm}}</ref> Some shelters, however, incorporate [[Chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear|NBC]]-filters for additional protection.\n\n=== Locations ===\nEffective public shelters can be the middle floors of some tall buildings or parking structures, or below ground level in most buildings with more than 10 floors. The thickness of the upper floors must form an effective shield, and the windows of the sheltered area must not view fallout-covered ground that is closer than 1.5&nbsp;km (1&nbsp;mi). One of Switzerland's solutions is to use road tunnels passing through the mountains, with some of [[Sonnenberg Tunnel|these shelters]] being able to protect tens of thousands.<ref name=BBC1>{{cite news|last=Foulkes|first=Imogen|title=Swiss still braced for nuclear war|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/6347519.stm|accessdate=August 15, 2012|newspaper=BBC News, Switzerland|date=February 10, 2007}}</ref>\n\nFallout shelters are not always underground.

Alpha particles are identical to a helium-4 nucleus (two protons and two neutrons), and travel at speeds in excess of 5% of the speed of light. [[Alpha particle]]s have little penetrating power; most cannot penetrate through human skin. Avoiding direct exposure with fallout particles will prevent injury from alpha radiation.<ref name=NWSSC>{{cite book|last=Kearny|first=Cresson H|title=Nuclear War Survival Skills|year=1986|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|location=Oak Ridge, TN|isbn=0-942487-01-X|pages=45|url=http://www.oism.org/nwss/s73p916.htm}}</ref>\n\n=== Beta (\u03b2) ===\n[[Beta particle|Beta radiation]] consists of particles (high-speed electrons) given off by some fallout. Most beta particles cannot penetrate more than about 10 feet (3 metres) of air or about {{frac|1|8}} inch (3 millimetres) of water, wood, or human body tissue; or a sheet of aluminum foil. Avoiding direct exposure with fallout particles will prevent most injuries from beta radiation.<ref name=NWSSD/>\n\nThe primary dangers associated with beta radiation are internal exposure from ingested fallout particles and beta burns from fallout particles no more than a few days old. [[Beta burn]]s can result from contact with highly radioactive particles on bare skin; ordinary clothing separating fresh fallout particles from the skin can provide significant shielding.<ref name=NWSSD>{{cite book |last=Kearny |first=Cresson H |title=Nuclear War Survival Skills |year=1986 |publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory |location=Oak Ridge, TN |isbn=0-942487-01-X |page=44 |url=http://www.oism.org/nwss/s73p916.htm}}</ref>\n\n=== Gamma (\u03b3) ===\n[[Gamma ray|Gamma radiation]] penetrates further through matter than alpha or beta radiation. Most of the design of a typical fallout shelter is intended to protect against gamma [[electromagnetic radiation|rays]]. Gamma rays are better absorbed by materials with high atomic numbers and high density, although neither effect is important compared to the total mass per area in the path of the gamma ray. Thus, lead is only modestly better as a gamma shield than an equal mass of another shielding material such as aluminum, concrete, water or soil.\n\nSome gamma radiation from fallout will penetrate into even the best shelters. However, the radiation dose received while inside a shelter can be significantly reduced with proper shielding. Ten [[Radiation protection#Shielding design|halving thicknesses]] of a given material can reduce gamma exposure to less than {{frac|1|1000}} of unshielded exposure.<ref name=NWSSE>{{cite book |last=Kearny |first=Cresson H |title=Nuclear War Survival Skills |year=1986 |publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory |location=Oak Ridge, TN |isbn=0-942487-01-X |pages=11\u201320 |url=http://www.oism.org/nwss/s73p912.htm}}</ref>\n\n== Weapons versus nuclear accident fallout ==\nThe bulk of the [[radioactivity]] in nuclear accident fallout is more long-lived than that in [[fallout|weapons fallout]]. A good table of the [[nuclide]]s, such as that provided by the [[Korean Atomic Energy Research Institute]], includes the [[Nuclear fission|fission]] yields of the different nuclides. From this data it is possible to calculate the isotopic mixture in the fallout (due to [[fission products]] in bomb fallout).{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\n== Other matters and simple improvements ==\nWhile a person's home may not be a purpose-made shelter, it could be thought of as one if measures are taken to improve the degree of [[Radiation protection|fallout protection]].\n\n=== Measures to lower the beta dose ===\nThe main threat of [[Radiation#Beta|beta radiation]] exposure comes from ''[[hot particle]]s'' in contact with or close to the skin of a person. Also, swallowed or inhaled hot particles could cause [[beta burn]]s. As it is important to avoid bringing hot particles into the shelter, one option is to remove one's outer clothing, or follow other [[human decontamination|decontamination procedures]], on entry. Fallout particles will cease to be radioactive enough to cause beta burns within a few days following a nuclear explosion. The danger of gamma radiation will persist for far longer than the threat of beta burns in areas with heavy fallout exposure.<ref name=NWSSA>{{cite book|last=Kearny|first=Cresson H|title=Nuclear War Survival Skills|year=1986|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|location=Oak Ridge, TN|isbn=0-942487-01-X|pages=131|url=http://www.oism.org/nwss/s73p926.htm#Message2481}}</ref>\n\n=== Measures to lower the gamma dose rate ===\nThe gamma dose rate due to the contamination brought into the shelter on the clothing of a person is likely to be small (by wartime standards) compared to [[Radiation#Gamma|gamma radiation]] that penetrates through the walls of the shelter.<ref name=NWSSA/> The following measures can be taken to reduce the amount of gamma radiation entering the shelter:\n* Roofs and gutters can be cleaned to lower the dose rate in the house.\n* The top inch of soil in the area near the house can be either removed or dug up and mixed with the [[subsoil]]. This reduces the dose rate as the gamma rays have to pass through the topsoil before they can irradiate anything above.\n* Nearby roads can be rinsed and washed down to remove dust and debris; the [[fallout]] would collect in the sewers and gutters for easier disposal. In [[Kiev]] after the [[Chernobyl accident]] a program of road washing was used to control the spread of radioactivity.\n* Windows can be bricked up, or the sill raised to reduce the hole in the shielding formed by the wall.\n* Gaps in the shielding can be blocked using containers of water. While water has a much lower density than that of lead, it is still able to shield some gamma rays.\n* Earth (or other dense material) can be heaped up against the exposed walls of the building; this forces the gamma rays to pass through a thicker layer of shielding before entering the house.\n* Nearby trees can be removed to reduce the dose due to fallout which is on the branches and leaves. It has been suggested by the US government that a fallout shelter should not be dug close to trees for this reason.<ref name=NWSSB>{{cite book|last=Kearny|first=Cresson H|title=Nuclear War Survival Skills|year=1986|publisher=Oak Ridge National Laboratory|location=Oak Ridge, TN|isbn=0-942487-01-X|pages=39|url=http://www.oism.org/nwss/s73p916.htm}}</ref>\n\n== Fallout shelters in popular culture ==\n[[File:United States Fallout Shelter Sign.svg|thumb|Robert W.

The islands have few [[mineral]] deposits worth exploiting, except for high-grade phosphate. The potential for a tourist industry exists, but the remoteness of the location and a lack of adequate facilities hinder development. Financial assistance from the US is the primary source of revenue, with the US pledged to spend $1.3 billion in the islands in 1986-2001. Geographical isolation and a poorly developed infrastructure are major impediments to long-term growth.\n\nUnder the terms of the [[Compact of Free Association]], the [[United States]] provided FSM with around $2 billion in grants and services from 1986 to 2001. The Compact's financial terms are being renegotiated for an extension period. In 2001 the U.S. provided more than $84 million in Compact grants\u2014an amount equivalent to over one-third of FSM's [[gross domestic product|GDP]]\u2014plus more than $20 million through other federal programs. Total official development assistance from all sources was more than $100 million in 2001, with nearly 90% of that total coming from the U.S.\n\nThe FSM [[public sector]] plays a central role in the economy as the administrator of the Compact money. The national and state-level governments employ over one-half of the country's workers and provide services accounting for more than 40%of GDP. Faced with the potential decrease or cessation of some of the assistance programs upon the Compact's financial provisions' expiry in 2001, the Government of the FSM in 1996 began to implement a program of economic reforms designed to reduce the role of the public sector in the economy. In addition, the advent of music startups using .fm domain names has provided a new stream of revenue to the government.\n\n==Industries==\n\nThe fishing industry is highly important. Foreign commercial fishing fleets pay over $20 million annually for the right to operate in FSM territorial waters. These licensing fees account for nearly 30% of domestic budgetary revenue. Additionally, exports of marine products, mainly reexports of fish to Japan, account for nearly 85% of export revenue.\n\nThe [[tourism|tourist industry]] is present but has been hampered by a lack of infrastructure. Visitor attractions include scuba diving in each state, World War II battle sites, and the ancient ruined city of [[Nan Madol]] on [[Pohnpei]]. Some 15,000 tourists visit the islands each year. The [[Asian Development Bank]] has identified tourism as one of FSM's highest potential growth industries.\n\nFarming is mainly subsistence, and its importance is declining. The principal crops are coconuts, bananas, betel nuts, cassava, and sweet potatoes. Less than 10% of the formal labor force and less than 7% of export revenue come from the agriculture sector. Manufacturing activity is modest, consisting mainly of a garment factory in [[Yap]] and production of buttons from [[trochus]] shells.\n\n==Taxation and trade==\n\nThe large inflow of official assistance to FSM allows it to run a substantial trade deficit and to have a much lighter tax burden than other states in the region (11% of GDP in FSM compared to 18%-25% elsewhere). The government also borrowed against future Compact disbursements in the early 1990s, yielding an [[national debt|external debt]] of $111 million in 1997 (over 50% of GDP).\n\nThere are no [[patent]] laws in Micronesia.<ref>http://www.billanderson.com.au/Gazetteer-Patents.htm</ref>\n\n==Statistics==\n'''GDP:'''\npurchasing power parity - $277 million (2002 est.)\n<br>''note:''\nGDP is supplemented by grant aid, averaging perhaps $100 million annually\n\n'''GDP - real growth rate:'''\n1% (2002 est.)\n\n'''GDP - per capita:'''\npurchasing power parity - $3 900 (2002 est.)\n\n'''GDP - composition by sector:'''\n<br>''agriculture:''\n47%\n<br>''industry:''\n10%\n<br>''services:''\n43% (2010 est.)\n\n'''Population below poverty line:'''\n22.3%\n\n'''Household income or consumption by percentage share:'''\n<br>''lowest 10%:''\nNA%\n<br>''highest 10%:''\nNA%\n\n'''Inflation rate (consumer prices):'''\n2% (2012 est.)\n\n'''Labor force:'''\n37,410 (2000)\n\n'''Labor force - by occupation:'''\ntwo-thirds are government employees\n\n'''Unemployment rate:'''\n15% (2010 estimate)\n\n'''Budget:'''\n<br>''revenues:''\n$157.5 million ($74 million less grants\n<br>''expenditures:''\n$134 million; including capital expenditures of $17.9 million (FY05 est.)\n\n'''Industries:'''\ntourism, construction, [[fish processing]], craft items from shell, wood, and [[pearl]]s\n\n'''Industrial production growth rate:'''\nNA%\n\n'''Electricity - production:'''\n261 million kWh (2010)\n\n'''Electricity - consumption:'''\n222 million kWh (2010)\n\n'''Electricity - exports:'''\n0 kWh (2010)\n\n'''Electricity - imports:'''\n0 kWh (2010)\n\n'''Agriculture - products:'''\n[[black pepper]], tropical fruits and vegetables, [[coconut]]s, [[cassava]] ([[tapioca]]), [[sweet potato]]es; [[pig]]s, [[chicken]]s\n\n'''Exports:'''\n$123 million (f.o.b., 2000 est.)\n\n'''Exports - commodities:'''\nfish, garments, [[banana]]s, black pepper\n\n'''Exports - partners:'''\n[[Japan]], [[United States]], [[Guam]], [[China]] (2010)\n\n'''Imports:'''\n$82.5 million f.o.b.

Fans typically are interested in even minor details of the object(s) of their fandom and spend a significant portion of their time and energy involved with their interest, often as a part of a [[social network]] with particular practices (a fandom); this is what differentiates \"fannish\" (fandom-affiliated) fans from those with only a casual interest.\n\nA fandom can grow around any area of [[human interest]] or activity. The subject of fan interest can be narrowly defined, focused on something like an individual [[celebrity]], or more widely defined, encompassing entire [[hobby|hobbies]], [[genre]]s or [[fashion]]s. While it is now used to apply to groups of people fascinated with any subject, the term has its roots in those with an enthusiastic appreciation for sports. [[Merriam\u2013Webster|Merriam-Webster's dictionary]] traces the usage of the term back as far as 1903.<ref name=\"mw-1903\">{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fandom|title=Fandom - Definition of fandom by Merriam-Webster|work=merriam-webster.com}}</ref>\n\nFandom as a term can also be used in a broad sense to refer to the [[interconnected]] [[social network]]s of individual fandoms,{{vague|date=November 2016}} many of which overlap. There are a number of large conventions that cater to fandom in this broad sense, catering to interests in film, comics, anime, television shows, cosplay, and the opportunity to buy and sell related merchandise.

Science fiction fandom dates back to the 1930s and maintains organized clubs and associations in many cities around the world.

[[Amateur press association]]s are another form of fan publication and networking. Originally using print-based media, these sub-cultures have migrated much of their communications and interaction onto the Internet, which they also use for the purpose of archiving detailed information pertinent to their given fanbase. Often, fans congregate on forums and discussion boards to share their love for and criticism of a specific work. This congregation can lead to a high level of organization and community within the fandom, as well as infighting. Although there is some level of hierarchy among most of the discussion boards in which certain contributors are valued more highly than others, newcomers are most often welcomed into the fold. Most importantly, these sorts of discussion boards can have an effect on the media itself as was the case in the television show ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]''.

Fort Collins is a midsize college city, home to [[Colorado State University]].\n\n==History==\nFort Collins was founded as a military outpost of the [[United States Army]] in 1864. It succeeded a previous encampment, known as [[Camp Collins]], on the [[Cache La Poudre River]], near what is known today as [[Laporte, Colorado|Laporte]]. Camp Collins was erected during the Indian wars of the mid-1860s to protect the Overland mail route that had been recently relocated through the region. Travelers crossing the county on the [[Overland Trail]] would camp there, but a flood destroyed the camp in June 1864.<ref name=\"flooding\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.fort-collins.co.us/oem/historical-flooding.php |title=Flooding Timeline in Fort Collins |accessdate=September 28, 2007 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uRWtNFfn?url=http://www.ci.fort-collins.co.us/oem/historical-flooding.php |archivedate=November 23, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}</ref> Afterward, the commander of the fort wrote to the commandant of Fort Laramie in southeast Wyoming, Colonel [[William O.

The fort was decommissioned in 1867. The original fort site is now adjacent to the present historic \"Old Town\" portion of the city. The first school and church opened in 1866, and the town was [[plat]]ted in 1867. The civilian population of Fort Collins, led by local businessman Joseph Mason, led an effort to relocate the county seat to Fort Collins from LaPorte, and they were successful in 1868.<ref name=\"l1860\">{{cite web |url=http://history.fcgov.com/archive/timeline/1860.php |title=Fort Collins Time Line 1860 |accessdate=March 24, 2007 |work=Fort Collins Local History Archive |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710232717/http://history.fcgov.com/archive/timeline/1860.php |archivedate=July 10, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe city's first population boom came in 1872, with the establishment of an agricultural colony.

Wounded, Le Testu was captured and later beheaded.  The small band of adventurers dragged as much gold and silver as they could carry back across some 18 miles of jungle-covered mountains to where they had left the raiding boats. When they got to the coast, the boats were gone. Drake and his men, downhearted, exhausted and hungry, had nowhere to go and the Spanish were not far behind.\n\nAt this point Drake rallied his men, buried the treasure on the beach, and built a raft to sail with two volunteers ten miles along the surf-lashed coast to where they had left the flagship.  When Drake finally reached its deck, his men were alarmed at his bedraggled appearance.  Fearing the worst, they asked him how the raid had gone. Drake could not resist a joke and teased them by looking downhearted. Then he laughed, pulled a necklace of Spanish gold from around his neck and said \"Our voyage is made, lads!\" By 9 August 1573, he had returned to Plymouth.\n\nIt was during this expedition that he climbed a high tree in the central mountains of the [[Isthmus of Panama]] and thus became the first Englishman to see the Pacific Ocean. He remarked as he saw it that he hoped one day an Englishman would be able to sail it\u2014which he would do years later as part of his circumnavigation of the world.<ref>Cummins 1997, p. 287</ref>\n\nWhen Drake returned to Plymouth after the raids, the government signed a temporary truce with King Philip II of Spain and so was unable to acknowledge Drake's accomplishment officially. Drake was considered a hero in England and a pirate in Spain for his raids.<ref>Cummins 1997, p. 273</ref>\n\n==Rathlin Island massacre==\nDrake was present at the [[Rathlin Island massacre]] in 1575. Acting on the instructions of Sir Henry Sidney and the Earl of Essex, Sir John Norreys and Drake laid siege to [[Rathlin Castle]].

The northern limit of Drake's exploration of the Pacific coast of North America is still in dispute. [[Drake's Bay]] is south of [[Cape Mendocino]].]]\n\nWith the success of the Panama isthmus raid, in 1577 [[Elizabeth I of England]] sent Drake to start an expedition against the Spanish along the [[Pacific]] coast of the Americas. Drake used the plans that Sir [[Richard Grenville]] had received the patent for in 1574 from Elizabeth, which was rescinded a year later after protests from Philip of Spain. He set out from Plymouth on 15 November 1577, but bad weather threatened him and his fleet.  They were forced to take refuge in [[Falmouth, Cornwall]], from where they returned to Plymouth for repair.\n\nAfter this major setback, Drake set sail again on 13 December aboard ''[[Golden Hind|Pelican]]'' with four other ships and 164 men. He soon added a sixth ship, ''Mary'' (formerly ''Santa Maria''), a Portuguese merchant ship that had been captured off the coast of Africa near the [[Portuguese Cape Verde|Cape Verde Islands]]. He also added its captain, Nuno da Silva, a man with considerable experience navigating in South American waters.\n\nDrake's fleet suffered great attrition; he scuttled both ''Christopher'' and the [[flyboat]] ''Swan'' due to loss of men on the Atlantic crossing. He made landfall at the gloomy bay of [[Puerto San Juli\u00e1n|San Julian]], in what is now [[Argentina]]. Ferdinand Magellan had called here half a century earlier, where he put to death some mutineers. Drake's men saw weathered and bleached skeletons on the grim Spanish [[gibbet]]s. Following Magellan's example, Drake tried and executed his own \"mutineer\" [[Thomas Doughty (explorer)|Thomas Doughty]]. The crew discovered that ''Mary'' had rotting timbers, so they burned the ship. Drake decided to remain the winter in San Julian before attempting the [[Strait of Magellan]].\n\n===Execution of Thomas Doughty===\n{{Main|Thomas Doughty (explorer)}}\n[[File:DrakeStatueTavistock.jpg|thumb|upright|Bronze statue in Tavistock, in the parish of which he was born, by [[Joseph Boehm]], 1883.]]\n\nOn his voyage to interfere with Spanish treasure fleets, Drake had several quarrels with his co-commander Thomas Doughty and on 3 June 1578, accused him of witchcraft and charged him with [[mutiny]] and [[treason]] in a shipboard trial.<ref name= Coote /> Drake claimed to have a (never presented) commission from the Queen to carry out such acts and denied Doughty a trial in England. The main pieces of evidence against Doughty were the testimony of the ship's carpenter, Edward Bright, who after the trial was promoted to master of the ship ''Marigold'', and Doughty's admission of telling [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|Lord Burghley]], a vocal opponent of agitating the Spanish, of the intent of the voyage. Drake consented to his request of [[Eucharist|Communion]] and dined with him, of which [[Francis Fletcher (clergyman)|Francis Fletcher]] had this strange account:\n\n{{quote|And after this holy repast, they dined also at the same table together, as cheerfully, in sobriety, as ever in their lives they had done aforetime, each cheering up the other, and taking their leave, by drinking each to other, as if some journey only had been in hand.}}\n\nDrake had Thomas Doughty beheaded on 2 July 1578. When the ship's chaplain Francis Fletcher in a sermon suggested that the woes of the voyage in January 1580 were connected to the unjust demise of Doughty, Drake chained the clergyman to a hatch cover and pronounced him excommunicated.\n\n===Entering the Pacific (1578)===\n[[File:Sfec goldenhind02crop.jpg|thumb|A replica of the ''[[Golden Hind]]'']]\n\nThe three remaining ships of his convoy departed for the Magellan Strait at the southern tip of South America. A few weeks later (September 1578) Drake made it to the Pacific, but violent storms destroyed one of the three ships, the ''Marigold'' (captained by John Thomas) in the strait and caused another, the ''Elizabeth'' captained by [[John Wynter]], to return to England, leaving only the ''Pelican''. After this passage, the ''Pelican'' was pushed south and discovered an island that Drake called [[Elizabeth Island (Cape Horn)|Elizabeth Island]]. Drake, like navigators before him, probably reached a latitude of 55\u00b0S (according to astronomical data quoted in [[Richard Hakluyt|Hakluyt]]'s ''The Principall Navigations, Voiages and Discoveries of the English Nation'' of 1589) along the Chilean coast.<ref name=Wagner>Wagner, Henry R., ''Sir Francis Drake's Voyage Around the World: Its Aims and Achievements'', Kessinger Publishing, LLC, 2006, {{ISBN|1-4286-2255-1}}.</ref> In the Magellan Strait Francis and his men engaged in skirmish with local indigenous people, becoming the first Europeans to kill indigenous peoples in southern Patagonia.<ref name=Mateo>{{cite book |last=Martinic |first=Mateo |author-link=Mateo Martinic |date=1977 |title=Historia del Estrecho de Magallanes |language=Spanish |url=http://www.memoriachilena.cl/602/w3-article-10441.html |location=Santiago |publisher=Andr\u00e9s Bello |pages=67\u201368 |isbn=}}</ref> During the stay in the strait, crew members discovered that an infusion made of the bark of ''[[Drimys winteri]]'' could be used as remedy against [[scurvy]].

The first report of his discovery of an open channel south of [[Tierra del Fuego]] was written after the 1618 publication of the voyage of [[Willem Schouten]] and [[Jacob le Maire]] around Cape Horn in 1616.<ref name=Kelsey>Kelsey, Harry, ''Sir Francis Drake; The Queen's Pirate'', Yale University Press, New Haven, 1998, {{ISBN|0-300-07182-5}}.</ref>\n\nDrake pushed onwards in his lone flagship, now renamed the ''[[Golden Hind]]'' in honour of Sir [[Christopher Hatton]] (after his [[coat of arms]]). The ''Golden Hind'' sailed north along the [[Pacific]] coast of South America, attacking Spanish ports and pillaging towns. Some Spanish ships were captured, and Drake used their more accurate charts. Before reaching the coast of [[Peru]], Drake visited [[Mocha Island]], where he was seriously injured by hostile [[Mapuche]]. Later he sacked the port of [[Valpara\u00edso]] further north in [[Chile]], where he also captured a ship full of [[Chilean wine]].<ref name=Orich>{{cite journal|last=Cort\u00e9s Olivares|first=Hern\u00e1n F. |url=http://www.scielo.cl/scielo.php?pid=S0718-23762005000200005&script=sci_arttext&tlng=es |title=El origen, producci\u00f3n y comercio del pisco chileno, 1546\u20131931 |doi=10.4067/S0718-23762005000200005 |journal=[[Revista Universum]] |publisher=Scielo.cl |date= |accessdate=25 October 2012 |language=Spanish}}</ref>\n\n===Capture of Spanish treasure ships===\nNear [[Lima]], Drake captured a Spanish ship laden with 25,000&nbsp;[[Spanish dollar|pesos]] of Peruvian gold, amounting in value to 37,000&nbsp;[[ducat]]s of Spanish money (about \u00a37m by modern standards). Drake also discovered news of another ship, ''[[Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Concepci\u00f3n]]'', which was sailing west towards [[Manila]]. It would come to be called the ''[[Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Concepci\u00f3n|Cacafuego]]''. Drake gave chase and eventually captured the treasure ship, which proved his most profitable capture.\n\nAboard ''Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Concepci\u00f3n'', Drake found {{convert|80|lb|abbr=on}} of gold, a golden [[crucifix]], [[gemstone|jewels]], 13&nbsp;chests full of royals of plate and 26&nbsp;tons of silver. Drake was naturally pleased at his good luck in capturing the galleon, and he showed it by dining with the captured ship's officers and gentleman passengers. He offloaded his captives a short time later, and gave each one gifts appropriate to their rank, as well as a letter of safe conduct.\n\n===Coast of California: Nova Albion (1579)===\n{{Main|New Albion}}\n[[File:Drake CA 1590.jpg|thumb|250px|Drake's landing in California, engraving published 1590 by [[Theodor de Bry]]]]\n\nAfter looting the Cacafuego, Drake turned north, hoping to meet another Spanish treasure ship coming south on its return from [[Manila galleon|Manila to Acapulco]]. Although he failed to find a treasure ship, Drake reputedly sailed as far north as the 38th parallel, landing on the coast of California on 17 June 1579. He found a good port, landed, repaired and restocked his vessels, then stayed for a time, keeping friendly relations with the [[Coast Miwok]] natives. He claimed the land in the name of the [[Trinity|Holy Trinity]] for the English Crown, called ''[[Nova Albion]]''\u2014[[Latin]] for \"New Britain\". Assertions that he left some of his men behind as an embryo \"colony\" are founded on the reduced number who were with him in the [[Maluku Islands|Moluccas]].<ref>Dismissed by John Cummins, ''Francis Drake: The Lives of a Hero'' (1997) p. 118: \"In view of the prominence given in different versions to the crowning of Drake it would be odd if the establishment of a colony had gone unrecorded.\"</ref>\n\nThe precise location of the port was carefully guarded to keep it secret from the Spaniards, and several of Drake's maps may have been altered to this end.  All first-hand records from the voyage, including logs, paintings and charts, were lost when [[Whitehall Palace]] burned in 1698. A bronze plaque inscribed with Drake's claim to the new lands \u2013 [[Drake's Plate of Brass]] \u2013 fitting the description in his account, was discovered in [[Marin County]], California but was later declared a hoax.

While there, ''Golden Hind'' became caught on a reef and was almost lost. After the sailors waited three days for convenient tides and had dumped cargo, they freed the barque. Befriending a sultan king of the Moluccas, Drake and his men became involved in some intrigues with the Portuguese there. He made multiple stops on his way toward the tip of Africa, eventually rounded the [[Cape of Good Hope]], and reached [[Sierra Leone]] by 22 July 1580.\n\n===Return to Plymouth (1580)===\n\nOn 26 September, ''Golden Hind'' sailed into Plymouth with Drake and 59&nbsp;remaining crew aboard, along with a rich cargo of spices and captured Spanish treasures. The Queen's half-share of the cargo surpassed the rest of the crown's income for that entire year. Drake was hailed as the first Englishman to circumnavigate the Earth (and the second such voyage arriving with at least one ship intact, after [[Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Elcano|Elcano]]'s in 1520).<ref name=\"The Drake Jewel\">{{cite web|url=http://oieahc.wm.edu/uncommon/118/drake.cfm |title=The Drake Jewel |publisher=Oieahc.wm.edu |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe Queen declared that all written accounts of Drake's voyages were to become the Queen's secrets of the Realm,<!--first publication date is needed here--> and Drake and the other participants of his voyages on the pain of death sworn to their secrecy; she intended to keep Drake's activities away from the eyes of rival Spain. Drake presented the Queen with a jewel token commemorating the circumnavigation. Taken as a prize off the Pacific coast of Mexico, it was made of enamelled gold and bore an African diamond and a ship with an ebony hull.<ref name=\"The Drake Jewel\"/>\n\nFor her part, the Queen gave Drake a jewel with her portrait, an unusual gift to bestow upon a commoner, and one that Drake sported proudly in his 1591 portrait by [[Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger|Marcus Gheeraerts]] now at the [[National Maritime Museum]], Greenwich. On one side is a state portrait of Elizabeth by the miniaturist [[Nicholas Hilliard]], on the other a [[sardonyx]] cameo of double portrait busts, a regal woman and an African male.

Bronze plaque by [[Joseph Boehm]], 1883, base of Drake statue, Tavistock]]\n[[File:Loutherbourg-Spanish Armada.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Spanish Armada]].]]\n\nDrake was [[vice admiral]] in command of the English fleet (under [[Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham|Lord Howard of Effingham]],) when it overcame the [[Spanish Armada]] that was attempting to invade England in 1588. As the English fleet pursued the Armada up the English Channel in closing darkness, Drake broke off and captured the Spanish galleon ''Rosario'', along with Admiral Pedro de Vald\u00e9s and all his crew. The Spanish ship was known to be carrying substantial funds to pay the Spanish Army in the Low Countries. Drake's ship had been leading the English pursuit of the Armada by means of a lantern. By extinguishing this for the capture, Drake put the fleet into disarray overnight.\n\nOn the night of 29 July, along with Howard, Drake organised [[Fire ship|fire-ships]], causing the majority of the Spanish captains to break formation and sail out of [[Calais]] into the open sea. The next day, Drake was present at the [[Naval battle of Gravelines|Battle of Gravelines]]. He wrote as follows to Admiral Henry Seymour after coming upon part of the Spanish Armada, whilst aboard ''[[English ship Revenge (1577)|Revenge]]'' on 31 July 1588 (21 July 1588 [[Old Style and New Style dates|O.S.]]):<ref>Letter to Admiral Henry Seymour written aboard ''Revenge'' on 31 July 1588 (21 July 1588 [[Old Style and New Style dates|O.S.]]) Turner, Sharon. ''The History of England from the Earliest Period to the Death of Elizabeth'', 1835.</ref><blockquote>Coming up to them, there has passed some common shot between some of our fleet and some of them; and as far as we perceive, they are determined to sell their lives with blows.</blockquote>\n\nThe most famous (but probably apocryphal) anecdote about Drake relates that, prior to the battle, he was playing a game of [[bowls]] on [[Plymouth Hoe]]. On being warned of the approach of the Spanish fleet, Drake is said to have remarked that there was plenty of time to finish the game and still beat the Spaniards. There is no known eyewitness account of this incident and the earliest retelling of it was printed 37 years later.<ref name=Kelsey/> Adverse winds and currents caused some delay in the launching of the English fleet as the Spanish drew nearer,<ref name=Kelsey /> perhaps prompting a popular myth of Drake's cavalier attitude to the Spanish threat.\n\n===Drake\u2013Norris Expedition===\n{{Main|English Armada}}\n\nIn 1589, the year after defeating the Armada, Drake and [[John Norreys|Sir John Norreys]] were given three tasks: seek out and destroy the remaining ships, support the rebels in [[Lisbon]], Portugal against King Philip II (then king of Spain and Portugal), and take the [[Azores]] if possible. Drake and Norreys destroyed a few ships in the harbour of [[A Coru\u00f1a]] in Spain but lost more than 12,000 lives and 20 ships.{{citation needed|date=March 2008}} This delayed Drake, and he was forced to forgo hunting the rest of the surviving ships and head on to Lisbon.<ref name=Kraus />\n\n==Defeats and death==\n[[File:BurialOfDrakeTavistockMonument.jpg|thumb|Drake's burial at sea off [[Portobelo, Col\u00f3n|Portobello]]. Bronze plaque by [[Joseph Boehm]], 1883, base of Drake statue, Tavistock.]]\n\nDrake's seafaring career continued into his mid-fifties. In 1595, he [[Battle of Las Palmas|failed to conquer]] the port of Las Palmas, and following a disastrous campaign against Spanish America, where he suffered a number of defeats, he unsuccessfully attacked San Juan de Puerto Rico, eventually losing the [[Battle of San Juan (1595)|Battle of San Juan]].\n\nThe Spanish gunners from [[El Morro Castle]] shot a cannonball through the cabin of Drake's flagship, but he survived. He attempted to attack San Juan again, but a few weeks later, in January 1596, he died (aged about 56) of [[dysentery]], a common disease in the tropics at the time, while anchored off the coast of [[Portobelo]], [[Panama]], where some Spanish treasure ships had sought shelter. Following his death, the English fleet withdrew.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thepirateking.com/bios/drake_francis.htm|title=Sir Francis Drake | website=thepirateking.com |accessdate=28 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nBefore dying, he asked to be dressed in his full armour. He was buried at sea in a sealed lead-lined coffin, near Portobelo, a few miles off the coastline. It is supposed that his final resting place is near the wrecks of two British ships, the ''Elizabeth'' and the ''Delight'', scuttled in Portobelo Bay. Divers continue to search for the coffin.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sir Francis Drake's body 'close to being found off Panama'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15447632|work=BBC News|accessdate=9 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/centralamericaandthecaribbean/panama/8847105/Sir-Francis-Drakes-final-fleet-discovered-off-the-coast-of-Panama.html|website=Telegraph Newspaper|title=Sir Francis Drake's final fleet 'discovered off the coast of Panama' |last1 = Henderson | first1 =Barney  |last2 = Swaine| first2=Jon  | date=24 October 2011 |accessdate=28 July 2017}}</ref> Drake\u2019s body has never been recovered.\n\n==Cultural impact==\n[[File:NPG Drake.jpg|thumb|upright|This portrait, circa 1581, may have been copied from [[Nicholas Hilliard|Hilliard's]] [[:Image:Sfdrake42.jpg|miniature]]\u2014note the similar shirt\u2014and the somewhat oddly-proportioned body, added by an artist who did not have access to Drake.

Places there carrying his name include the naval base ([[HMS Drake]]), [[Drake's Island]] and a [[Drake Circus Shopping Centre|shopping centre]] and [[roundabout]] named [[Drake (ward)|Drake Circus]]. [[Plymouth Hoe]] is also home to a statue of Drake.\n\nIn the United States [[Drakes Bay]] and [[Sir Francis Drake Boulevard]] of [[Marin County, California]] are both named after him, as well as the high school in [[San Anselmo, California]]. The boulevard runs between Drakes Bay at [[Point Reyes]] to [[New Albion#Point San Quentin, San Francisco Bay, California|Point San Quentin]] on [[San Francisco Bay]]. A large hotel in [[Union Square, San Francisco]] also bears his name.  Additionally, the [[Sir Francis Drake Channel]] in the [[British Virgin Islands]] bears his name.\n\nIn [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]], where some theorize he may also have landed to the north of the usual site considered to be [[Nova Albion]], various mountains were named in the 1930s for him, or in connection with Elizabeth I or other figures of that era, including [[Mount Sir Francis Drake]], [[Mount Queen Bess]], and the [[Golden Hinde]], the highest mountain on [[Vancouver Island]].\n\nDrake's will was the focus of a vast [[confidence scheme]] which [[Oscar Hartzell]] perpetrated in the 1920s and 1930s.  He convinced thousands of people, mostly in the American Midwest, that Drake's fortune was being held by the British government, and had compounded to a huge amount. If their last name was Drake they might be eligible for a share if they paid Hartzell to be their agent. The swindle continued until a copy of Drake's will was brought to Hartzell's mail fraud trial and he was convicted and imprisoned.<ref name=Rayner-Richard>Rayner, Richard (22 April 2002). \"The Admiral and the Con Man\".

This transformation is illustrated in Diagram 1. Over the time period measured in the diagram, the signal contains 3 distinct dominant frequencies. \n\nAn FFT [[algorithm]] computes the [[discrete Fourier transform]] (DFT) of a sequence, or its inverse (IFFT). [[Fourier analysis]] converts a signal from its original domain to a representation in the [[frequency domain]] and vice versa. An FFT rapidly computes such transformations by [[matrix decomposition|factorizing]] the [[DFT matrix]] into a product of [[sparse matrix|sparse]] (mostly zero) factors.<ref name=\"Loan_1992\"/> As a result, it manages to reduce the [[computational complexity theory|complexity]] of computing the DFT from <math>O(n^2)</math>, which arises if one simply applies the definition of DFT, to <math>O(n \\log n)</math>, where <math>n</math> is the data size.\n\nFast Fourier transforms are widely used for [[discrete Fourier transform#Applications|many applications]] in engineering, science, and mathematics. The basic ideas were popularized in 1965, but some algorithms had been derived as early as 1805.<ref name=\"Heideman_Johnson_Burrus_1984\"/> In 1994, [[Gilbert Strang]] described the FFT as \"the most important [[numerical analysis|numerical algorithm]] of our lifetime\"<ref name=\"Strang_1994\"/><ref name=\"Kent_2002\"/> and it was included in Top 10 Algorithms of 20th Century by the [[IEEE]] journal ''[[Computing in Science & Engineering]]''.<ref name=\"Dongarra_Sullivan_2000\"/>\n\n==Overview==\n{{Refimprove section|date=November 2017}}\nThere are many different FFT algorithms based on a wide range of published theories, from simple [[complex number|complex-number arithmetic]] to [[group theory]] and [[number theory]]; this article gives an overview of the available techniques and some of their general properties, while the specific algorithms are described in subsidiary articles linked below.\n\nThe DFT is obtained by decomposing a [[sequence]] of values into components of different frequencies.<ref name=\"Heideman_Johnson_Burrus_1984\"/> This operation is useful in many fields (see [[discrete Fourier transform]] for properties and applications of the transform) but computing it directly from the definition is often too slow to be practical. An FFT is a way to compute the same result more quickly: computing the DFT of ''N'' points in the naive way, using the definition, takes [[Big O notation|O]](''N''<sup>2</sup>) arithmetical operations, while an FFT can compute the same DFT in only O(''N'' log ''N'') operations. The difference in speed can be enormous, especially for long data sets where ''N'' may be in the thousands or millions. In practice, the computation time can be reduced by several [[orders of magnitude]] in such cases, and the improvement is roughly [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional to]] ''N''<math>/</math>&nbsp;log&nbsp;''N''. This huge improvement made the calculation of the DFT practical; FFTs are of great importance to a wide variety of applications, from [[digital signal processing]] and solving [[partial differential equation]]s to algorithms for quick [[multiplication algorithm|multiplication of large integers]].\n\nThe best-known FFT algorithms depend upon the [[factorization]] of ''N'', but there are FFTs with [[Big O notation|O(''N''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''N'')]] [[Computational complexity theory|complexity]] for all ''N'', even for [[prime number|prime]]&nbsp;''N''. Many FFT algorithms only depend on the fact that <math>e^{-2\\pi i/N}</math> is an ''N''-th [[primitive root of unity]], and thus can be applied to analogous transforms over any [[finite field]], such as [[number-theoretic transform]]s. Since the inverse DFT is the same as the DFT, but with the opposite sign in the exponent and a 1/''N'' factor, any FFT algorithm can easily be adapted for it.\n\n== History ==\nThe development of fast algorithms for DFT can be traced to [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]]'s unpublished work in 1805 when he needed it to interpolate the orbit of asteroids [[2 Pallas|Pallas]] and [[3 Juno|Juno]] from sample observations.<ref name=\"Gauss_1866\"/><ref name=\"Heideman_Johnson_Burrus_1985\"/> His method was very similar to the one published in 1965 by [[James Cooley|Cooley]] and [[John Tukey|Tukey]], who are generally credited for the invention of the modern generic FFT algorithm. While Gauss's work predated even [[Joseph Fourier|Fourier]]'s results in 1822, he did not analyze the computation time and eventually used other methods to achieve his goal.\n\nBetween 1805 and 1965, some versions of FFT were published by other authors. [[Frank Yates]] in 1932 published his version called ''interaction algorithm'', which provided efficient computation of [[Hadamard transform|Hadamard and Walsh transforms]].<ref name=\"Yates_1937\"/> Yates' algorithm is still used in the field of statistical design and analysis of experiments. In 1942, [[G. C. Danielson]] and [[Cornelius Lanczos]] published their version to compute DFT for [[x-ray crystallography]], a field where calculation of Fourier transforms presented a formidable bottleneck.<ref name=\"Danielson_Lanczos_1942\"/><ref name=\"Lanczos_1956\"/> While many methods in the past had focused on reducing the constant factor for <math>O(n^2)</math> computation by taking advantage of \"symmetries\", Danielson and Lanczos realized that one could use the \"periodicity\" and apply a \"doubling trick\" to get <math>O(n \\log n)</math> runtime.<ref name=\"Cooley_Lewis_Welch_1967\"/>\n\n[[James Cooley]] and [[John Tukey]] published a [[Cooley\u2013Tukey FFT algorithm|more general version of FFT]] in 1965 that is applicable when N is composite and not necessarily a power of 2.<ref name=\"Cooley_Tukey_1965\"/> Tukey came up with the idea during a meeting of [[President Kennedy]]'s Science Advisory Committee where a discussion topic involved detecting nuclear tests by the Soviet Union by setting up sensors to surround the country from outside. To analyze the output of these sensors, a fast Fourier transform algorithm would be needed. In discussion with Tukey, [[Richard Garwin]] recognized the general applicability of the algorithm not just to national security problems, but also to a wide range of problems including one of immediate interest to him, determining the periodicities of the spin orientations in a 3-D crystal of Helium-3.<ref name=\"Cooley_1987\"/> Garwin gave Tukey's idea to Cooley (both worked at [[Thomas J. Watson Research Center|IBM's Watson labs]]) for implementation.<ref name=\"Garwin_1969\"/> Cooley and Tukey published the paper in a relatively short time of six months.<ref name=\"Rockmore_2000\"/> As Tukey did not work at IBM, the patentability of the idea was doubted and the algorithm went into the public domain, which, through the computing revolution of the next decade, made FFT one of the indispensable algorithms in digital signal processing.\n\n==Definition and speed==\nAn FFT computes the [[discrete Fourier transform|DFT]] and produces exactly the same result as evaluating the DFT definition directly; the most important difference is that an FFT is much faster. (In the presence of [[round-off error]], many FFT algorithms are also much more accurate than evaluating the DFT definition directly, as discussed below.)\n\nLet ''x''<sub>0</sub>, ...., ''x''<sub>''N''\u22121</sub> be [[complex number]]s. The DFT is defined by the formula\n\n:<math> X_k =  \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n e^{-i2\\pi kn/N}\n\\qquad\nk = 0,\\dots,N-1. </math>\n\nEvaluating this definition directly requires O(''N''<sup>2</sup>) operations: there are ''N'' outputs ''X''<sub>''k''</sub>, and each output requires a sum of ''N'' terms. An FFT is any method to compute the same results in O(''N''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''N'') operations. All known FFT algorithms require [[Big O notation#Use in computer science|\u0398]](''N''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''N'') operations, although there is no known proof that a lower complexity score is impossible.<ref name=\"Frigo_Johnson_2007\"/>\n\nTo illustrate the savings of an FFT, consider the count of complex multiplications and additions for N=4096 data points. Evaluating the DFT's sums directly involves ''N''<sup>2</sup> complex multiplications and ''N''(''N''\u22121) complex additions, of which O(''N'') operations can be saved by eliminating trivial operations such as multiplications by 1, leaving about 30 million operations. On the other hand, the radix-2 [[#Cooley\u2013Tukey algorithm|Cooley\u2013Tukey algorithm]], for ''N'' a power of 2, can compute the same result with only (''N''/2)log<sub>2</sub>(''N'') complex multiplications (again, ignoring simplifications of multiplications by 1 and similar) and ''N''&nbsp;log<sub>2</sub>(''N'') complex additions, in total about 30,000 operations - a thousand times less than with direct evaluation. In practice, actual performance on modern computers is usually dominated by factors other than the speed of arithmetic operations and the analysis is a complicated subject (see, e.g., Frigo & [[Steven G. Johnson|Johnson]], 2005),<ref name=\"Frigo_Johnson_2005\"/> but the overall improvement from O(''N''<sup>2</sup>) to O(''N''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''N'') remains.\n\n==Algorithms==\n\n===Cooley\u2013Tukey algorithm===\n{{main article|Cooley\u2013Tukey FFT algorithm}}\n\nBy far the most commonly used FFT is the Cooley\u2013Tukey algorithm. This is a [[divide and conquer algorithm]] that [[recursion|recursively]] breaks down a DFT of any [[composite number|composite]] size ''N'' = ''N''<sub>1</sub>''N''<sub>2</sub> into many smaller DFTs of sizes ''N''<sub>1</sub> and ''N''<sub>2</sub>, along with O(''N'') multiplications by complex [[roots of unity]] traditionally called [[twiddle factor]]s (after Gentleman and Sande, 1966<ref name=\"Gentleman_Sande_1966\"/>).\n\nThis method (and the general idea of an FFT) was popularized by a publication of Cooley and Tukey in 1965,<ref name=\"Cooley_Tukey_1965\"/> but it was later discovered<ref name=\"Heideman_Johnson_Burrus_1984\"/> that those two authors had independently re-invented an algorithm known to [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] around 1805<ref name=\"Gauss_1805\"/> (and subsequently rediscovered several times in limited forms).\n\nThe best known use of the Cooley\u2013Tukey algorithm is to divide the transform into two pieces of size ''N''/2 at each step, and is therefore limited to power-of-two sizes, but any factorization can be used in general (as was known to both Gauss and Cooley/Tukey<ref name=\"Heideman_Johnson_Burrus_1984\"/>). These are called the ''radix-2'' and ''mixed-radix'' cases, respectively (and other variants such as the [[split-radix FFT]] have their own names as well).  Although the basic idea is recursive, most traditional implementations rearrange the algorithm to avoid explicit recursion. Also, because the Cooley\u2013Tukey algorithm breaks the DFT into smaller DFTs, it can be combined arbitrarily with any other algorithm for the DFT, such as those described below.\n\n===Other FFT algorithms===\n{{main article|Prime-factor FFT algorithm|Bruun's FFT algorithm|Rader's FFT algorithm|Bluestein's FFT algorithm|Hexagonal Fast Fourier Transform}}\n\nThere are other FFT algorithms distinct from Cooley\u2013Tukey.\n\n[[Cornelius Lanczos]] did pioneering work on the FFT and FFS ([[fast Fourier sampling]] method) with [[G. C. Danielson]] (1940).\n\nFor ''N'' = ''N''<sub>1</sub>''N''<sub>2</sub> with [[coprime]] ''N''<sub>1</sub> and ''N''<sub>2</sub>, one can use the [[Prime-factor FFT algorithm|prime-factor]] (Good\u2013Thomas) algorithm (PFA), based on the [[Chinese remainder theorem]], to factorize the DFT similarly to Cooley\u2013Tukey but without the twiddle factors. The Rader\u2013Brenner algorithm (1976)<ref name=\"Brenner_Rader_1976\"/> is a Cooley\u2013Tukey-like factorization but with purely imaginary twiddle factors, reducing multiplications at the cost of increased additions and reduced [[numerical stability]]; it was later superseded by the [[split-radix FFT algorithm|split-radix]] variant of Cooley\u2013Tukey (which achieves the same multiplication count but with fewer additions and without sacrificing accuracy). Algorithms that recursively factorize the DFT into smaller operations other than DFTs include the Bruun and [[Quick Fourier transform algorithm|QFT]] algorithms. (The Rader\u2013Brenner<ref name=\"Brenner_Rader_1976\"/> and QFT algorithms were proposed for power-of-two sizes, but it is possible that they could be adapted to general composite ''n''. Bruun's algorithm applies to arbitrary even composite sizes.) [[Bruun's FFT algorithm|Bruun's algorithm]], in particular, is based on interpreting the FFT as a recursive factorization of the [[polynomial]] ''z''<sup>''N''</sup>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1, here into real-coefficient polynomials of the form ''z''<sup>''M''</sup>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 and ''z''<sup>2''M''</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''az''<sup>''M''</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;1.\n\nAnother polynomial viewpoint is exploited by the Winograd FFT algorithm,<ref name=\"Winograd_1978\"/><ref name=\"Winograd_1979\"/> which factorizes ''z''<sup>''N''</sup>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 into [[cyclotomic polynomial]]s\u2014these often have coefficients of 1,&nbsp;0,&nbsp;or&nbsp;\u22121, and therefore require few (if any) multiplications, so Winograd can be used to obtain minimal-multiplication FFTs and is often used to find efficient algorithms for small factors. Indeed, Winograd showed that the DFT can be computed with only O(''N'') irrational multiplications, leading to a proven achievable lower bound on the number of multiplications for power-of-two sizes; unfortunately, this comes at the cost of many more additions, a tradeoff no longer favorable on modern [[central processing unit|processors]] with [[floating-point unit|hardware multipliers]]. In particular, Winograd also makes use of the PFA as well as an algorithm by Rader for FFTs of ''prime'' sizes.\n\n[[Rader's FFT algorithm|Rader's algorithm]], exploiting the existence of a [[generating set of a group|generator]] for the multiplicative [[group (mathematics)|group]] modulo prime ''N'', expresses a DFT of prime size ''n'' as a cyclic [[convolution]] of (composite) size ''N''\u22121, which can then be computed by a pair of ordinary FFTs via the [[convolution theorem]] (although Winograd uses other convolution methods). Another prime-size FFT is due to L. I. Bluestein, and is sometimes called the [[chirp-z algorithm]]; it also re-expresses a DFT as a convolution, but this time of the ''same'' size (which can be zero-padded to a [[power of two]] and evaluated by radix-2 Cooley\u2013Tukey FFTs, for example), via the identity\n\n: <math>nk = -\\frac{(k-n)^2} 2 + \\frac{n^2} 2 + \\frac{k^2} 2.</math>\n\n[[Hexagonal Fast Fourier Transform]] aims at computing an efficient FFT for the hexagonally sampled data by using a new addressing scheme for hexagonal grids, called Array Set Addressing (ASA).\n\n==FFT algorithms specialized for real and/or symmetric data==\nIn many applications, the input data for the DFT are purely real, in which case the outputs satisfy the symmetry\n\n:<math>X_{N-k} = X_k^*</math>\n\nand efficient FFT algorithms have been designed for this situation (see e.g. Sorensen, 1987).<ref name=\"Sorensen_Jones_Heideman_Burrus_1987_1\"/><ref name=\"Sorensen_Jones_Heideman_Burrus_1987_2\"/> One approach consists of taking an ordinary algorithm (e.g. Cooley\u2013Tukey) and removing the redundant parts of the computation, saving roughly a factor of two in time and memory. Alternatively, it is possible to express an ''even''-length real-input DFT as a complex DFT of half the length (whose real and imaginary parts are the even/odd elements of the original real data), followed by O(''N'') post-processing operations.\n\nIt was once believed that real-input DFTs could be more efficiently computed by means of the [[discrete Hartley transform]] (DHT), but it was subsequently argued that a specialized real-input DFT algorithm (FFT) can typically be found that requires fewer operations than the corresponding DHT algorithm (FHT) for the same number of inputs. Bruun's algorithm (above) is another method that was initially proposed to take advantage of real inputs, but it has not proved popular.\n\nThere are further FFT specializations for the cases of real data that have [[even and odd functions|even/odd]] symmetry, in which case one can gain another factor of (roughly) two in time and memory and the DFT becomes the discrete cosine/sine transform(s) ([[discrete cosine transform|DCT]]/[[discrete sine transform|DST]]).  Instead of directly modifying an FFT algorithm for these cases, DCTs/DSTs can also be computed via FFTs of real data combined with O(''N'') pre/post processing.\n\n==Computational issues==\n\n===Bounds on complexity and operation counts===\n{{unsolved|computer science|What is the lower bound on the complexity of fast Fourier transform algorithms?  Can they be faster than <math>O(N\\log N)</math>?}}\nA fundamental question of longstanding theoretical interest is to prove lower bounds on the [[computational complexity theory|complexity]] and exact operation counts of fast Fourier transforms, and many open problems remain. It is not even rigorously proved whether DFTs truly require \u03a9(''N''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''N'') (i.e., order ''N''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''N'' or greater) operations, even for the simple case of [[power of two]] sizes, although no algorithms with lower complexity are known. In particular, the count of arithmetic operations is usually the focus of such questions, although actual performance on modern-day computers is determined by many other factors such as [[Cache (computing)|cache]] or [[pipeline (computing)|CPU pipeline]] optimization.\n\nFollowing pioneering work by [[Shmuel Winograd|Winograd]] (1978),<ref name=\"Winograd_1978\"/> a tight \u0398(''N'') lower bound ''is'' known for the [[Arithmetic complexity of the discrete Fourier transform|number of real multiplications required by an FFT]]. It can be shown that only <math>4N-2\\log_2^2 N-2\\log_2 N-4</math> irrational real multiplications are required to compute a DFT of power-of-two length <math>N=2^m</math>. Moreover, explicit algorithms that achieve this count are known (Heideman & [[Charles Sidney Burrus|Burrus]], 1986;<ref name=\"Heideman_Burrus_1986\"/> Duhamel, 1990<ref name=\"Duhamel_1990\"/>). Unfortunately, these algorithms require too many additions to be practical, at least on modern computers with hardware multipliers (Duhamel, 1990;<ref name=\"Duhamel_1990\"/> Frigo & [[Steven G. Johnson|Johnson]], 2005).<ref name=\"Frigo_Johnson_2005\"/>\n\nA tight lower bound is ''not'' known on the number of required additions, although lower bounds have been proved under some restrictive assumptions on the algorithms. In 1973, Morgenstern<ref name=\"Morgenstern_1973\"/> proved an \u03a9(''N''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''N'') lower bound on the addition count for algorithms where the multiplicative constants have bounded magnitudes (which is true for most but not all FFT algorithms). This result, however, applies only to the unnormalized Fourier transform (which is a scaling of a unitary matrix by a factor of <math>\\sqrt N</math>), and does not explain why the Fourier matrix is harder to compute than any other unitary matrix (including the identity matrix)  under the same scaling. [[Victor Pan|Pan]] (1986)<ref name=\"Pan_1986\"/> proved an \u03a9(''N''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''N'') lower bound assuming a bound on a measure of the FFT algorithm's \"asynchronicity\", but the generality of this assumption is unclear. For the case of power-of-two ''N'', [[Christos Papadimitriou|Papadimitriou]] (1979)<ref name=\"Papadimitriou_1979\"/> argued that the number <math>N \\log_2 N</math> of complex-number additions achieved by Cooley\u2013Tukey algorithms is ''optimal'' under certain assumptions on the [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] of the algorithm (his assumptions imply, among other things, that no additive identities in the roots of unity are exploited). (This argument would imply that at least <math>2 N \\log_2 N</math> real additions are required, although this is not a tight bound because extra additions are required as part of complex-number multiplications.) Thus far, no published FFT algorithm has achieved fewer than <math>N \\log_2 N</math> complex-number additions (or their equivalent) for power-of-two&nbsp;''N''.\n\nA third problem is to minimize the ''total'' number of real multiplications and additions, sometimes called the \"arithmetic complexity\" (although in this context it is the exact count and not the asymptotic complexity that is being considered).  Again, no tight lower bound has been proven. Since 1968, however, the lowest published count for power-of-two ''N'' was long achieved by the [[split-radix FFT algorithm]], which requires <math>4N\\log_2 N-6N+8</math> real multiplications and additions for ''N'' > 1. This was recently reduced to <math>\\sim \\frac{34}{9} N \\log_2 N</math> (Johnson and Frigo, 2007;<ref name=\"Frigo_Johnson_2007\"/> Lundy and Van Buskirk, 2007<ref name=\"Lundy_Buskirk_2007\"/>). A slightly larger count (but still better than split radix for ''N''\u2265256) was shown to be provably optimal for ''N''\u2264512 under additional restrictions on the possible algorithms (split-radix-like flowgraphs with unit-modulus multiplicative factors), by reduction to a [[satisfiability modulo theories]] problem solvable by [[Proof by exhaustion|brute force]] (Haynal & Haynal, 2011).<ref name=\"Haynal_2011\"/>\n\nMost of the attempts to lower or prove the complexity of FFT algorithms have focused on the ordinary complex-data case, because it is the simplest. However, complex-data FFTs are so closely related to algorithms for related problems such as real-data FFTs, [[discrete cosine transform]]s, [[discrete Hartley transform]]s, and so on, that any improvement in one of these would immediately lead to improvements in the others (Duhamel & Vetterli, 1990).<ref name=\"Duhamel_Vetterli_1990\"/>\n\n===Approximations===\nAll of the FFT algorithms discussed above compute the DFT exactly (i.e. neglecting [[floating-point]] errors). A few \"FFT\" algorithms have been proposed, however, that compute the DFT ''approximately'', with an error that can be made arbitrarily small at the expense of increased computations. Such algorithms trade the approximation error for increased speed or other properties. For example, an approximate FFT algorithm by Edelman et al. (1999)<ref name=\"Edelman_McCorquodale_Toledo_1999\"/> achieves lower communication requirements for [[parallel computing]] with the help of a [[fast multipole method]]. A [[wavelet]]-based approximate FFT by Guo and Burrus (1996)<ref name=\"Guo_Burrus_1996\"/> takes sparse inputs/outputs (time/frequency localization) into account more efficiently than is possible with an exact FFT. Another algorithm for approximate computation of a subset of the DFT outputs is due to Shentov et al. (1995).<ref name=\"Shentov_Mitra_Heute_Hossen_1995\"/> The Edelman algorithm works equally well for sparse and non-sparse data, since it is based on the compressibility (rank deficiency) of the Fourier matrix itself rather than the compressibility (sparsity) of the data. Conversely, if the data are sparse\u2014that is, if only ''K'' out of ''N'' Fourier coefficients are nonzero\u2014then the complexity can be reduced to O(''K''&nbsp;log(''N'')log(''N''/''K'')), and this has been demonstrated to lead to practical speedups compared to an ordinary FFT for ''N''/''K''&nbsp;>&nbsp;32 in a large-''N'' example (''N''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2<sup>22</sup>) using a probabilistic approximate algorithm (which estimates the largest ''K'' coefficients to several decimal places).<ref name=\"Hassanieh_2012\"/>\n\n===Accuracy===\nEven the \"exact\" FFT algorithms have errors when finite-precision floating-point arithmetic is used, but these errors are typically quite small; most FFT algorithms, e.g. Cooley\u2013Tukey, have excellent numerical properties as a consequence of the [[pairwise summation]] structure of the algorithms.  The upper bound on the [[approximation error|relative error]] for the Cooley\u2013Tukey algorithm is O(''\u03b5'' log ''N''), compared to O(''\u03b5N''<sup>3/2</sup>) for the na\u00efve DFT formula,<ref name=\"Gentleman_Sande_1966\"/> where \u03b5 is the machine floating-point relative precision. In fact, the [[root mean square]] (rms) errors are much better than these upper bounds, being only O(''\u03b5'' {{radic|log ''N''}}) for Cooley\u2013Tukey and O(''\u03b5'' {{radic|''N''}}) for the na\u00efve DFT (Schatzman, 1996).<ref name=\"Schatzman_1996\"/> These results, however, are very sensitive to the accuracy of the twiddle factors used in the FFT (i.e. the [[trigonometric function]] values), and it is not unusual for incautious FFT implementations to have much worse accuracy, e.g. if they use inaccurate [[generating trigonometric tables|trigonometric recurrence]] formulas. Some FFTs other than Cooley\u2013Tukey, such as the Rader\u2013Brenner algorithm, are intrinsically less stable.\n\nIn [[fixed-point arithmetic]], the finite-precision errors accumulated by FFT algorithms are worse, with rms errors growing as O({{radic|''N''}}) for the Cooley\u2013Tukey algorithm (Welch, 1969).<ref name=\"Welch_1969\"/> Moreover, even achieving this accuracy requires careful attention to scaling to minimize loss of precision, and fixed-point FFT algorithms involve rescaling at each intermediate stage of decompositions like Cooley\u2013Tukey.\n\nTo verify the correctness of an FFT implementation, rigorous guarantees can be obtained in O(''N''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''N'') time by a simple procedure checking the linearity, impulse-response, and time-shift properties of the transform on random inputs (Erg\u00fcn, 1995).<ref name=\"Erg\u00fcn_1995\"/>\n\n==Multidimensional FFTs==\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Discrete Fourier transform]] -->\n\nAs defined in the [[Discrete Fourier transform#Multidimensional DFT|multidimensional DFT]] article, the multidimensional DFT\n\n:<math>X_\\mathbf{k} = \\sum_{\\mathbf{n}=0}^{\\mathbf{N}-1} e^{-2\\pi i \\mathbf{k} \\cdot (\\mathbf{n} / \\mathbf{N})} x_\\mathbf{n}</math>\n\ntransforms an array ''x''<sub>'''n'''</sub> with a ''d''-dimensional [[coordinate vector|vector]] of indices <math>\\mathbf{n}=(n_1, \\ldots, n_d)</math> by a set of ''d'' nested summations (over <math>n_j = 0 \\ldots N_j-1</math> for each ''j''), where the division '''n'''/'''N''', defined as <math>\\mathbf{n} / \\mathbf{N} = (n_1/N_1, \\ldots, n_d/N_d)</math>, is performed element-wise.  Equivalently, it is the composition of a sequence of ''d'' sets of one-dimensional DFTs, performed along one dimension at a time (in any order).\n\nThis compositional viewpoint immediately provides the simplest and most common multidimensional DFT algorithm, known as the '''row-column''' algorithm (after the two-dimensional case, below). That is, one simply performs a sequence of ''d'' one-dimensional FFTs (by any of the above algorithms): first you transform along the ''n''<sub>1</sub> dimension, then along the ''n''<sub>2</sub> dimension, and so on (or actually, any ordering works). This method is easily shown to have the usual O(''N''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''N'') complexity, where <math>N = N_1 \\cdot N_2 \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot N_d</math> is the total number of data points transformed. In particular, there are ''N''/''N''<sub>1</sub> transforms of size ''N''<sub>1</sub>, etcetera, so the complexity of the sequence of FFTs is:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n& \\frac{N}{N_1} O(N_1 \\log N_1) + \\cdots + \\frac{N}{N_d} O(N_d \\log N_d) \\\\[6pt]\n= {} & O\\left(N \\left[\\log N_1 + \\cdots + \\log N_d\\right]\\right) = O(N \\log N).\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nIn two dimensions, the ''x''<sub>'''k'''</sub> can be viewed as an <math>n_1 \\times n_2</math> [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]], and this algorithm corresponds to first performing the FFT of all the rows (resp. columns), grouping the resulting transformed rows (resp. columns) together as another <math>n_1 \\times n_2</math> matrix, and then performing the FFT on each of the columns (resp. rows) of this second matrix, and similarly grouping the results into the final result matrix.\n\nIn more than two dimensions, it is often advantageous for [[Cache (computing)|cache]] locality to group the dimensions recursively.  For example, a three-dimensional FFT might first perform two-dimensional FFTs of each planar \"slice\" for each fixed ''n''<sub>1</sub>, and then perform the one-dimensional FFTs along the ''n''<sub>1</sub> direction. More generally, an [[asymptotically optimal]] [[cache-oblivious]] algorithm consists of recursively dividing the dimensions into two groups <math>(n_1, \\ldots, n_{d/2})</math> and <math>(n_{d/2+1}, \\ldots, n_d)</math> that are transformed recursively (rounding if ''d'' is not even) (see Frigo and Johnson, 2005).<ref name=\"Frigo_Johnson_2005\"/> Still, this remains a straightforward variation of the row-column algorithm that ultimately requires only a one-dimensional FFT algorithm as the base case, and still has O(''N''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''N'') complexity.  Yet another variation is to perform matrix [[transpose|transpositions]] in between transforming subsequent dimensions, so that the transforms operate on contiguous data; this is especially important for [[out-of-core]] and [[distributed memory]] situations where accessing non-contiguous data is extremely time-consuming.\n\nThere are other multidimensional FFT algorithms that are distinct from the row-column algorithm, although all of them have O(''N''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''N'') complexity. Perhaps the simplest non-row-column FFT is the [[vector-radix FFT algorithm]], which is a generalization of the ordinary Cooley\u2013Tukey algorithm where one divides the transform dimensions by a vector <math>\\mathbf{r}=(r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_d)</math> of radices at each step. (This may also have cache benefits.) The simplest case of vector-radix is where all of the radices are equal (e.g. vector-radix-2 divides ''all'' of the dimensions by two), but this is not necessary.  Vector radix with only a single non-unit radix at a time, i.e. <math>\\mathbf{r}=(1, \\ldots, 1, r, 1, \\ldots, 1)</math>, is essentially a row-column algorithm. Other, more complicated, methods include polynomial transform algorithms due to Nussbaumer (1977),<ref name=\"Nussbaumer_1977\"/> which view the transform in terms of convolutions and polynomial products. See Duhamel and Vetterli (1990)<ref name=\"Duhamel_Vetterli_1990\"/> for more information and references.\n\n==Other generalizations==\nAn O(''N''<sup>5/2</sup>log&nbsp;''N'') generalization to [[spherical harmonics]] on the sphere ''S''<sup>2</sup> with ''N''<sup>2</sup> nodes was described by Mohlenkamp,<ref name=\"Mohlenkamp_1999\"/> along with an algorithm conjectured (but not proven) to have O(''N''<sup>2</sup> log<sup>2</sup>(''N'')) complexity; Mohlenkamp also provides an implementation in the libftsh library.<ref name=\"libftsh\"/> A spherical-harmonic algorithm with O(''N''<sup>2</sup>log&nbsp;''N'') complexity is described by Rokhlin and Tygert.<ref name=\"Rokhlin_Tygert_2006\"/>\n\nThe [[fast folding algorithm]] is analogous to the FFT, except that it operates on a series of binned waveforms rather than a series of real or complex scalar values. Rotation (which in the FFT is multiplication by a complex phasor) is a circular shift of the component waveform.\n\nVarious groups have also published \"FFT\" algorithms for non-equispaced data, as reviewed in Potts ''et al.'' (2001).<ref name=\"Potts_Steidl_Tasche_2001\"/> Such algorithms do not strictly compute the DFT (which is only defined for equispaced data), but rather some approximation thereof (a [[non-uniform discrete Fourier transform]], or NDFT, which itself is often computed only approximately). More generally there are various other methods of [[spectral estimation]].\n\n==Applications==\nFFT's importance derives from the fact that in signal processing and image processing it has made working in frequency domain equally computationally feasible as working in temporal or spatial domain. Some of the important applications of FFT includes,<ref name=\"Rockmore_2000\"/><ref name=\"Chu_George_1999\"/>\n* Fast large integer and polynomial multiplication\n* Efficient matrix-vector multiplication for [[Toeplitz matrix|Toeplitz]], [[Circulant matrix|circulant]] and other structured matrices\n* Filtering algorithms (see [[Overlap-add method|overlap-add]] and [[Overlap-save method|overlap-save]] methods)\n* Fast algorithms for discrete cosine or sine transforms (example, [[Discrete cosine transform|Fast DCT]] used for JPEG, MP3/MPEG encoding)\n* Fast [[Chebyshev approximation]]\n* Fast discrete [[Hartley transform]]\n* Solving [[Recurrence relation|difference equation]]s\n* Computation of [[Mass spectrometry|isotopic distributions]].<ref name=\"Fernandez-de-Cossio_2012\"/>\n\n==Research areas==\n* '''Big FFTs''': With the explosion of big data in fields such as astronomy, the need for 512k FFTs has arisen for certain interferometry calculations. The data collected by projects such as [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe|MAP]] and [[LIGO]] require FFTs of tens of billions of points. As this size does not fit into main memory, so called out-of-core FFTs are an active area of research.<ref name=\"Cormen_Nicol_1998\"/>\n* '''Approximate FFTs''': For applications such as MRI, it is necessary to compute DFTs for nonuniformly spaced grid points and/or frequencies. Multipole based approaches can compute approximate quantities with factor of runtime increase.<ref name=\"Dutt_Rokhlin_1993\"/>\n* '''[[Fourier transform on finite groups|Group FFTs]]''': The FFT may also be explained and interpreted using [[Group representation|group representation theory]] that allows for further generalization. A function on any compact group, including non cyclic, has an expansion in terms of a basis of irreducible matrix elements. It remains active area of research to find efficient algorithm for performing this change of basis. Applications including efficient spherical harmonic expansion, analyzing certain markov processes, robotics etc.<ref name=\"Rockmore_2004\"/>\n* '''[[Quantum Fourier transform|Quantum FFTs]]''': Shor's fast algorithm for [[integer factorization]] on a quantum computer has a subroutine to compute DFT of a binary vector. This is implemented as sequence of 1- or 2-bit quantum gates now known as quantum FFT, which is effectively the Cooley\u2013Tukey FFT realized as a particular factorization of the Fourier matrix.

However, although the Jacobites had captured both of the other forts in the chain of three [[Great Glen]] fortifications ([[Fort Augustus]] and the original [[Fort George, Highland|Fort George]]) they failed to take Fort William.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Fort William was the home of {{HMS|St Christopher|shore establishment|6}} which was a training base for Royal Navy [[British Coastal Forces of World War II|Coastal Forces]].\n\nMore on the history of the town and the region can be found in the [[West Highland Museum]] on the High Street.\n\n[[File:Ben Nevis.

They join in the intertidal zone and briefly become one river before discharging to the sea. The town and its suburbs are surrounded by picturesque mountains. It is also on the shore of [[Loch Eil]]. It is close to [[Ben Nevis]], the highest mountain in the [[British Isles]], [[Glen Nevis]] and the town of [[Achnaphubuil]], is on the opposite shore of the loch. When the railway opened to Fort William on 7 August 1894, the station was given prime position at the south end of the town. The consequence was that the town was separated from the lochside by railway tracks until the 1970s when the present by-pass was built, and the station was re-located to the north end.\n\nThe town is centred on the High Street, which was pedestrianised in the 1990s. Off this there are several squares. Monzie Square (named after the Cameron Campbells of Monzie, [[Perthshire]], former landowners in the town), Station Square, where the long-since demolished railway station used to be, Gordon Square (named after the Gordons, who owned land where the town now stands in the late 18th century, when the town was named Gordonsburgh), and Cameron Square&nbsp;\u2014 formerly known as Town Hall Square. There is also Fraser Square which is not so square-like since it now opens out into Middle Street but it still houses the Imperial Hotel.\n\nThe main residential areas of the town are unseen from the High Street and from the [[A82 road|A82 main road]]. Upper Achintore and the Plantation spread steeply uphill from above the high street.\n[[Image:Corpach and Inverlochy crop.jpg|thumb|left|Inverlochy, aluminium plant, Corpach and Loch Eil]]\nInverlochy, Claggan, An-Aird, Lochyside, [[Caol]], [[Banavie]] and [[Corpach]] outwith (i.e. outside) the town are the other main residential areas.

Thoroughly English [[List of English words of French origin|words of French origin]], such as ''art'', ''competition'', ''force'', ''machine'', ''money'', ''police'', ''publicity'', ''role'', ''routine'' and ''table'', are pronounced according to [[English language|English]] rules of [[phonology]], rather than [[French language|French]], and are commonly used by English speakers without any consciousness of their French origin.\n\nThis article, on the other hand, covers French words and phrases that have entered the English lexicon without ever losing their character as Gallicisms: they remain unmistakably \"French\" to an English speaker. They are most common in written English, where they retain French [[diacritic]]s and are usually printed in italics. In spoken English, at least some attempt is generally made to pronounce them as they would sound in French; an entirely English pronunciation is regarded as a [[solecism]].\n\nSome of them were [[Franglais|never \"good French\"]], in the sense of being grammatical, idiomatic French usage. Some others were once normal French but have become very old-fashioned, or have acquired different meanings and connotations in the original language, to the extent that they would not be understood (either at all, or in the intended sense) by a native French speaker.\n\n<!--BEGIN OUTLINE-->\n<center>\n{| border=\"0\" class=\"toccolours\"\n|-\n! {{MediaWiki:Toc}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|\n[[#A|A]] [[#B|B]] [[#C|C]] [[#D|D]] [[#E|E]] [[#F|F]] [[#G|G]] [[#H|H]] [[#I|I]] [[#J|J]] K [[#L|L]] [[#M|M]] [[#N|N]] [[#O|O]] [[#P|P]] [[#Q|Q]] [[#R|R]] [[#S|S]] [[#T|T]] [[#U|U]] [[#V|V]] W X Y [[#Z|Z]] __NOTOC__\n\n[[#Not used as such in French|Not used as such in French]] \u2014 [[#Found only in English|Found only in English]] \u2014 [[#French phrases in international air-sea rescue|French phrases in international air-sea rescue]] \u2014 [[#See also|See also]] \u2014 [[#References|References]]\n|}\n</center>\n<!--END OUTLINE-->\n\n== Used in English and French ==\n\n=== A ===\n[[Image:Aperitif for five.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ap\u00e9ritif]]s with amuse-gueules]]\n[[Image:Striding Edge.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Ar\u00eate]]]]\n\n; [[wikt:\u00e0 gogo|\u00e0 gogo]]: in abundance.

It means \"in an unaltered way\" and can be used either for people or things. For people, it rather refers to a person who does not use make-up or artificial manners (''un entretien au naturel'' = a backstage interview). For things, it means that they have not been altered. Often used in cooking, like ''thon au naturel'': canned tuna without any spices or oil. Also in heraldry, meaning \"in natural colours\", especially flesh colour, which is not one of the \"standard\" colours of heraldry.\n; [[auteur]]: A film director, specifically one who controls most aspects of a film, or other controller of an artistic situation. The English connotation derives from French film theory. It was popularized in the journal ''[[Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma]]'': auteur theory maintains that directors like Hitchcock exert a level of creative control equivalent to the author of a literary work. In French, the word means \"author\", but some expressions like ''cin\u00e9ma d'auteur'' are also in use.\n; [[wikt:b\u00eate noire|b\u00eate noire]]: a scary or unpopular person, idea, or thing, or the archetypal scary monster in a story; literally \"black beast.\" In French, ''\u00eatre la b\u00eate noire de quelqu'un'' (\"to be somebody's black beast\") means that you're particularly hated by this person or this person has a strong aversion against you, regardless of whether you're scary or not. The dictionary of the [[Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise]] admits its use only for people, though other dictionaries admits it for things or ideas too. It also means that one is repeatedly defeated by a person, who is thus considered their archenemy (for instance, \"Nadal is the b\u00eate noire of Roger Federer\").\n; [[boutique]]: a clothing store, usually selling designer/one off pieces rather than mass-produced clothes. Can also describe a quirky and/or upmarket hotel. In French, it can describe any shop, clothing or otherwise. The expression ''h\u00f4tel-boutique'' can be used to refer to upmarket hotels, but the word is recent and not as widespread as the equivalent expression [[boutique hotel]].\n; [[boutonni\u00e8re]]: In English, a boutonni\u00e8re is a flower placed in the buttonhole of a suit jacket. In French, a boutonni\u00e8re is the buttonhole itself. Yet the French expression \"Une fleur \u00e0 la boutonni\u00e8re\" has an equivalent meaning.\n; c'est magnifique, mais ce n'est pas la guerre: \"it is magnificent, but it is not war\" \u2014 quotation from [[Pierre Bosquet|Marshal Pierre Bosquet]] commenting on the [[charge of the Light Brigade]].

The word ch\u00e2teau is also used for castles in French, so where clarification is needed, the term ch\u00e2teau fort (\"strong castle\") is used to describe a castle.\n; [[chef]]: in English, a person who cooks professionally for other people. In French, a professional cook is a ''cuisinier'' (lit. \"cook\"), ''chef-cuisinier'' referring to a head cook. Also, '''sous-chef''', the second-in-command, directly under the head chef. Traditionally, ''chef'' used to means the head, for example a \"couvre-chef\" is a headgear, but by extension it's often used in job titles, military ranks, for a person in charge or who leads a group of people: \"chef d'\u00c9tat\" (lit. \"Head of State\" and \"Chief of State\"), \"chef d'entreprise\" (\"Business executive\"), \"chef d'orchestre\" (Conductor of an Orchestra), \"sergeant-chef\" (Staff Sergeant), \"chef de gare\" (stationmaster), \"chef de famille\" (head of household), etc. More casually in a work context, a ''chef'' is a boss.\n; [[cinq \u00e0 sept]]: extraconjugal affair between five and seven pm.

It is spelled ''conn'''a'''isseur'' in modern French (lit. \"someone who knows\").\n; [[corsage]]: A bouquet of flowers worn on a woman's dress or worn around her wrist. In French, it refers to a woman's chest (from shoulder to waist) and, by extension, the part of a woman's garment that covers this area.\n; [[coup de main]] (pl. coups de main): a surprise attack. In French, ''[donner] un coup de main'' means \"[to give] a hand\" (to give assistance). Even if the English meaning exists as well (as in ''faire le coup de main''), it is old-fashioned.\n; [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] (pl. coups d'\u00c9tat): a sudden change in government by force; literally \"hit (blow) of state.\" French uses the capital \u00c9, because the use of a capital letter alters the meaning of the word ('''\u00c9'''tat: a State, as in a country; '''\u00e9'''tat: a state of being). It also cannot be shortened as ''coup'', which literally means a \"hit\" in French, but can be used figuratively to mean many more things.\n; [[wiktionary:d\u00e9but|d\u00e9but]]: first public performance of an entertainment personality or group. In French, it means \"beginning.\" The English meaning of the word exists only when in the plural form: ''[faire] ses d\u00e9buts [sur sc\u00e8ne]'' (to make one's d\u00e9buts on the stage).\n; [[d\u00e9colletage]]: a low-cut neckline, cleavage.

This term is commonly used in Canadian French; however, in France, it means a repairman. In France, a convenience store would be a ''sup\u00e9rette'' or ''\u00e9picerie [de quartier]''.\n; [[\u00e9migr\u00e9]]: one who has emigrated for political reasons. French also use the word ''exil\u00e9'' (exiled) or ''r\u00e9fugi\u00e9'' (refugee) or even \"exil\u00e9 politique\" or \"r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 politique\".\n; [[encore (concert)|encore]]: A request to repeat a performance, as in ''Encore!'', lit. 'again'; also used to describe additional songs played at the end of a [[concert|gig]].

In French, ''masse'' refers only to a physical mass, whether for people or objects. It cannot be used for something immaterial, like, for example, the voice: \"they all together said 'get out'\" would be translated as ''ils ont dit 'dehors' en ch\u0153ur'' ([like a chorus]). Also, ''en masse'' refers to numerous people or objects (a crowd or a mountain of things). In colloquial Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois French, it means \"a bunch\" (as in ''il y avait du monde en masse'', \"there was a bunch of people\").\n; [[en suite]]: as a set (not to be confused with ''ensuite'', meaning \"then\"). Can refer, in particular, to hotel rooms with attached private bathroom, especially in Britain where hotels without private facilities are more common than in North America. In French, ''suite'', when in the context of a hotel, already means several rooms following each other. ''J'ai lou\u00e9 une suite au Ritz'' would be translated as \"I rented a suite at the Ritz.\" ''En suite'' is not grammatically incorrect in French, but it is not an expression in itself and it is not used.\n; [[entr\u00e9e]]: lit. \"entrance\"; in French, the first dish that starts a meal, i.e. the entrance to the meal. It can refer to a set of bites or small snacks, or a small dish served before a main course. The main dish or \"plat de r\u00e9sistance\" comes after the entr\u00e9e. In American English, the meaning has migrated to \"main dish\". In other varieties of English it maintains its French meaning.\n; [[\u00e9p\u00e9e]]: a fencing weapon descended from the duelling sword. In French, apart from fencing (the sport) the term is more generic: it means sword.\n; [[escritoire]]: a writing table. It is spelt ''\u00e9critoire'' in modern French.\n; [[Expos\u00e9 (journalism)|expos\u00e9]]: a published exposure of a fraud or scandal (past participle of \"to expose\"); in French refers to a talk or a report on any kind of subject.\n; [[femme]]: a stereotypically effeminate gay man or lesbian (slang, pronounced as written). In French, ''femme'' (pronounced 'fam') means \"woman.\"\n; [[fin de si\u00e8cle]]: comparable to (but not exactly the same as) [[turn-of-the-century]] but with a connotation of decadence, usually applied to the period from 1890 through 1910. In French, it means \"end of the century\", but it isn't a recognized expression as such. The French expression \"ambiance [de] fin de r\u00e8gne\" (lit. \"end-of-reign atmosphere\") also has a light connotation of boredom and decadence.\n; [[wikt:forte|forte]]: a strength, a strong point, typically of a person, from the French ''fort(e)'' (strong) and/or Italian ''forte'' (strong, esp. \"loud\" in music) and/or Latin ''forte'' (neuter form of ''fortis'', strong). French uses ''fort(e)'' for both people and objects.\n: According to Merriam Webster Dictionary, \"In ''forte'' we have a word derived from French that in its \"strong point\" sense has no entirely satisfactory pronunciation. Usage writers have denigrated \\'for-\"tA\\ and \\'for-tE\\ because they reflect the influence of the Italian-derived ''forte''. Their recommended pronunciation \\'fort\\, however, does not exactly reflect French either: the French would write the word ''le fort'' and would rhyme it with English ''for'' [French doesn't pronounce the final \"t\"]. All are standard, however. In British English \\'fo-\"tA\\ and \\'fot\\ predominate; \\'for-\"tA\\ and \\for-'tA\\ are probably the most frequent pronunciations in American English.\"\n: The New Oxford Dictionary of English derives it from fencing. In French, ''le fort d'une \u00e9p\u00e9e'' is the third of a blade nearer the hilt, the strongest part of the sword used for parrying.\n\n; [[hors d'oeuvre]]: term used for the snacks served with drinks before a meal. Literally \"outside of the work\". The French use ''ap\u00e9ritif'' to refer to the time before a meal and the drinks consumed during that time, yet \"hors d'\u0153uvre\" is a synonym of \"entr\u00e9e\" in French and means the first dish that starts a meal. In Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois French, ''ap\u00e9ritif'' refers to the drink only, and ''hors-d'\u0153uvre'' (usually plural) refers to a set of bites, while an ''entr\u00e9e'' is a small dish (an ''entr\u00e9e'' can be made as ''hors-d'\u0153uvres'', but not all of them are).\n; la sauce est tout: \"The sauce is everything!\" or \"The secret's in the sauce!\" Tagline used in a 1950s American television commercial campaign for an American line of canned food products. Grammatically correct but not used in French, where one might say ''Tout est dans la sauce'' or ''C'est la sauce qui fait (passer) le poisson''.\n; [[:wiktionary:fr:fr:lavatoire|Lavatoire]] or [[Toilet (room)|Lavatory]]: A once commonly used British term for a toilet or water closet. Before the age of the internet, it was commonly believed, and widely taught in schools in Britain, that the word Toilet was a rather vulgar, impure, corruption of the French word \"[[:fr:Toilettes|Toilettes]]\" and that Lavatory was the correct expression to use because it was much closer in meaning to the French the word it was derived from, \"Lavatoire\", which was supposed to mean \"to wash, or to clean, yourself\". Actually, though the word Lavatoire does exist in French, it never meant a toilet or a bathroom. The Lavatoire was the holy stone upon which the bodies of ecclesiastics, priest and members of the clergy, were once washed after their deaths, in order to prepare them for the afterlife, for their journey to heaven.\n; [[Marquee (sign)|marquee]]: the sign above a theater that tells you what is playing. From ''marquise'', which means not only a marchioness but also an awning. Theater buildings are generally old and nowadays there is never such a sign above them; there is only the advertisement for the play (''l'affiche'').\n; {{visible anchor|nostalgie de la boue}}: \"yearning for the mud\"; attraction to what is unworthy, crude or degrading.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nostalgie+de+la+boue|title=Definition of NOSTALGIE DE LA BOUE|author=|date=|website=www.merriam-webster.com|accessdate=April 14, 2018}}</ref> Though grammatically correct, it is not used in French.\n; objet trouv\u00e9: an ordinary object, such as a piece of driftwood, a shell, or a manufactured article, that is treated as an ''objet d'art'' because it is aesthetically pleasing.<ref>\"Throughout the year, the acquisition of a new vase or photograph, or the discovery of an object trouv\u00e9 \u2013 a skeleton leaf, a fragment of painted paper, an intriguingly shaped piece of wood \u2013 is the excuse for a bout of rearranging,\" Elspeth Thompson, \"Still life with Agn\u00e8s\", ''The Sunday Telegraph Magazine'', August 18, 1996.</ref> In French, ''les objets trouv\u00e9s'', short for ''le bureau des objets trouv\u00e9s'', means the lost-and-found, the lost property.\n; [[outr\u00e9]]: out of the ordinary, unusual.

The correct expression in French is ''pass\u00e9 de mode.'' Pass\u00e9 means past, passed, or (for a colour) faded.\n; [[peignoir]]: a woman's dressing gown. It means [[bathrobe]]. In French, both ''peignoir'' and ''robe de chambre'' are used interchangeably, though the latter is generally considered formal and the former is generally seen as colloquial.\n; [[pi\u00e8ce d'occasion]]: \"occasional piece\"; item written or composed for a special occasion. In French, it means \"second-hand hardware.\" Can be shortened as ''pi\u00e8ce d'occas{{'}}'' or even ''occas{{'}}'' (pronounced /okaz/).\n; [[Portmanteau|portemanteau]] (pl. portemanteaux): in English a portmanteau is a large piece of luggage for clothes that opens (like a book or a diptych) into two parts. From this literal sense, [[Lewis Carroll]], in his novel ''[[Through the Looking Glass]]'' playfully coined a further [[Literal and figurative language|figurative]] sense for portmanteau meaning a word that fuses two or more words or parts of words to give a combined meaning. In French, lit. a 'coat-carrier', originally a person who carried the royal coat or dress train, now a large suitcase; more often, a clothes hanger. The equivalent of the English/ Lewis-Carroll ''portemanteau'' is ''un mot-valise'' (lit. a suitcase word).\n; [[potpourri]]: medley, mixture; French write it ''pot-pourri'', literally 'rotten pot': primarily a pot in which different kinds of flowers or spices are put to dry for years for the scent.\n; [[wikt:pr\u00e9cis|pr\u00e9cis]]: a concise summary. In French, when talking about a school course, it means an abridged book about the matter. Literally, ''pr\u00e9cis'' means precise, accurate.\n; [[premi\u00e8re]]: refers to the first performance of a play, a film, etc. \"La premi\u00e8re\" can be used in same way in French, but it more generally means \"the first\".\n; [[wikt:raisonneur|raisonneur]]: a type of author intrusion in which a writer inserts a character to argue the author's viewpoint; alter ego, sometimes called 'author avatar'. In French, a ''raisonneur'' is a character in a play who stands for morality and reason, i.e., not necessarily the author's point of view. The first meaning of this word though is a man (fem. ''raisonneuse'') who overdoes reasonings, who tires by objecting with numerous arguments to every order.\n; [[wikt:recherch\u00e9|recherch\u00e9]]: lit. searched; obscure; pretentious. In French, means 'sophisticated' or 'delicate', or simply 'studied', without the negative connotations of the English.\n; [[wikt:rendezvous|rendezvous]]: lit. \"present yourself\" or \"proceed to\"; a meeting, appointment, or date in French. In English, it generally endorses a mysterious overtone and refers to a one-on-one meeting with someone for another purpose than a date. Always hyphenated in French: ''rendez-vous''. Its only accepted abbreviation in French is RDV.\n; [[reprise]]: repetition of previous music in a suite, programme, etc. In French, it may mean an alternate version of a piece of music, or a [[cover version]], or the rebroadcast of a show, piece or movie that was originally broadcast a while ago (although the term ''rediffusion'' is generally preferred, especially when talking about something on television). To express the repetition of a previous musical theme, French would exclusively use the Italian term [[Coda (music)|coda]].\n; [[r\u00e9sum\u00e9]]: in [[North American English]], a document listing one's qualifications for employment. In French, it means summary; French speakers would use instead ''curriculum vit\u00e6'', or its abbreviation, C.V. (like most other English speakers).\n; [[wikt:risqu\u00e9|risqu\u00e9]] '''(also risque)''': sexually suggestive;<ref>\"Teacher Alan Faulkner warned: 'Some of the skirts were getting very risque and [...] the girls would face disciplinary action',\" ''Daily Mail'', September 21, 1996.</ref> in French, the meaning of ''risqu\u00e9'' is \"risky\", with no sexual connotation. Francophones use instead ''os\u00e9'' (lit. \"daring\") or sometimes ''d\u00e9vergond\u00e9'' (very formal language). ''Os\u00e9'', unlike ''d\u00e9vergond\u00e9'', cannot be used for people themselves, only for things (such as pictures) or attitudes.\n; ''rouge'' (lit. \"red\") : 1) a [[rouge (cosmetics)|rouge]] is red makeup, also called blusher. ''Rouge \u00e0 l\u00e8vres'' is French for \"lipstick\", even if the lipstick is not red at all. The French equivalent to the English meaning is \"fard \u00e0 joues\"; 2) in [[Canadian football]], a [[Single (football)|rouge]] is awarded when the ball is kicked into the end zone by any legal means, other than a successful field goal, and the receiving team does not return or kick the ball out of its end zone.\n; [[s\u00e9ance]] : a gathering, usually using a 'medium', attempting to communicate with the dead. In French, the word means 'sitting' and usually refers to any kind of meeting or session.\n; [[table d'h\u00f4te]] (pl. tables d'h\u00f4te): in English, when used it usually refers to type of meal: a full-course meal offered at a fixed price. However, in French, it refers to a type of lodging: the closest English equivalent would be \"a bed & breakfast\" or \"B&B.\" The origin of the meaning (for French speakers) is that at a table d'h\u00f4te (literally \"table of the house\" or \"table of the host\"), unlike at a full-service purpose-built hotel, all patrons eat together at the host's table, whatever the family have prepared for themselves (typically traditional regional dishes). Indeed, in France today a lodging labeled \"table d'h\u00f4te\" might perhaps not even offer food; the appellation meaning what an English-speaker would think of as a \"bed & breakfast -style\" family-home lodging (as opposed to a purpose-built hotel). In Quebec, ''table d'h\u00f4te'' generally has the same meaning as in English, the expression ''couette et caf\u00e9'' (lit. \"duvet and coffee\") is generally used to talk about B&B style accommodations, where the English expression is not used.\n; [[tableau vivant]] (pl. tableaux vivants, often shortened as ''tableau''): in drama, a scene where actors remain motionless as if in a picture.

Exchange controls such as these were imposed by the South African government to restrict the outflow of capital from the country.]]\nThe [[South Africa]]n '''financial rand''' was the most visible part of a system of [[capital control]]s. Although the financial rand was abolished in March 1995, some capital controls remain in place. These capital controls are locally referred to as \"exchange controls\", although the system has since 1995 moved towards surveillance \u2014  recording and reporting to the authorities of foreign currency transactions \u2014 rather than control.\n\nCapital controls have been in place in South Africa in various guises on an uninterrupted basis since the outbreak of [[World War II]], when [[Great Britain]] and its dominions implemented the [[Sterling area]].\n\nFollowing the 1960 [[Sharpeville massacre]], South Africa experienced significant outflows of foreign exchange on the [[capital account]] of the [[balance of payments]] and instituted an additional level of capital controls, known as the Blocked Rand system. This had the principal effect of blocking outflows of capital to the other countries in the Sterling Area, notably Britain.\n\nTo some extent the Blocked Rand system mirrored [[Germany|Germany's]] [[Reichsbank]] system introduced under [[Hjalmar Schacht]] in 1937, called \"aski\" accounts \u2014 short for ''Ausl\u00e4nder Sonderkonten f\u00fcr Inlandszahlungen'' (\"foreigners' special accounts for inland payments\"). In other words, creating a closed loop system that did not create a claim on the foreign exchange reserves of the Third Reich, or in this case South Africa.\n\nThe report of the De Kock Commission on Exchange Controls tabled in November 1978, proposed a gradual easing of exchange controls. This saw the replacement of the Blocked Rand by the Financial Rand in early 1979. In line with this policy, the Financial Rand itself was abolished in 1983 and non-residents could repatriate the majority of their South African investments via the Commercial Rand.\n\nThis easing was, however, short-lived and the Financial Rand system was re-introduced on 1 September 1985. The outflows during 1984\u20131985 were largely the result of economic sanctions in response to [[apartheid]].<ref name=\"Lewis\">{{cite book\n|title=The Economics of Apartheid\n|first=Stephen R., Jr.\n|last=Lewis\n|publisher=[[Council on Foreign Relations]] Press\n|year=1990\n|isbn=0-87609-056-0\n|page=76}}</ref> At the same time, the government enacted the exchange controls.

There are two known Iron Age sites \u2013 a promontory fort at Landberg and the foundations of a house underlying an early Christian settlement at Kirkigeo.\n\nMost of the place-names date from after the 9th-century Norse settlement of the Northern Isles. By that time the croft lands had clearly been in use for centuries.\n\nBetween the 9th and 15th centuries, Fair Isle was a [[List of possessions of Norway|Norwegian possession]]. In 1469, Shetland along with Orkney, became a part of the dowry of the [[Christian I of Denmark|King of Denmark]]'s daughter, [[Margaret of Denmark, Queen of Scotland|Margaret]], on her marriage to [[James III of Scotland]].<ref>Krauskopf, Sharma (2003). ''Scotland's Northern Lights'': Sharma Krauskopf. p. 7.</ref>\n\nOn 20 August 1588 the flagship of the [[Spanish Armada]], ''[[El Gran Grif\u00f3n]]'', was shipwrecked in the cove of Stroms Heelor, forcing its 300 sailors to spend six weeks living with the islanders. The wreck was discovered in 1970. The large Canadian sailing ship ''[[Black Watch (full rigged ship)|Black Watch]]'' was wrecked on Fair Isle in 1877.\n[[File:Fair Isle - Croft houses.jpg|thumb|260px|[[Croft houses]]]]\nFair Isle was bought by the [[National Trust for Scotland]] in 1954 from George Waterston, the founder of the bird observatory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ntseducation.org.uk/students/case-fairIsle.html |title=Case Study: Wind Power on Fair Isle |publisher=[[National Trust for Scotland]] |accessdate=2008-05-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420084059/http://www.ntseducation.org.uk/students/case-fairIsle.html |archivedate=20 April 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book| author=Nicolson, James R| year=1972| title=Shetland| location=Newton Abbot| publisher=David & Charles| page=27}}</ref>\n\nThe population has been decreasing steadily from about 400 in 1900. There are currently around 55 permanent residents on the island,<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\"/> the majority of whom are crofters who work the land. The island has 14 [[scheduled monument]]s, ranging from the earliest signs of human activity to the remains of a [[World War II|Second World War]] radar station. The two automated lighthouses are protected as [[listed buildings]].\n\nThe island houses a series of high-technology relay stations carrying vital TV, radio, telephone and military communication links between Shetland, Orkney and the Scottish mainland.<ref>See reference at [http://www.fairisle.org.uk/History/ Fairisle.org.uk].</ref> In this respect it continues its historic role as a signal-station, linking the mainland and the more remote island groups. In 1976, when television relay equipment was updated to permit colour broadcasts to Shetland, the new equipment was housed in former World War Two radar station buildings on Fair Isle.<ref>See \"Bringing Colour to the Shetland Isles\", by Gerry L Sanderson, 1976, page 48, available on-line [http://tx.mb21.co.uk/gallery/bringing_colour_to_the_Shetland_isles.pdf here].</ref> Many television signals are relayed from Orkney to Shetland (rather than from the Scottish mainland) via Orkney's Keelylang Hill transmitter station.\n\n==Economy==\nOver the centuries the island has changed hands many times. Trading links with [[Northern Europe]] are reflected in Fair Isle Haa, a traditional [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] trading booth located not far from the South Harbour, traditionally used by residents of the southern part of the island. Rent was usually paid to [[absentee landlord]]s (who rarely visited) in butter, cloth and fish oil.\n\nFishing has always been an important industry for the island. In 1702, the Dutch, who were interested in Shetland's herring fisheries, fought a naval battle against French warships just off the island.\n\nFair Isle is also noted for its [[woollen]] [[sweater|jumpers]], with [[Fair Isle (technique)|knitting]] forming an important source of income for the women of the islands. The principal activity for the male islanders is [[crofting]].\n\nIn January 2004, Fair Isle was granted [[Fairtrade Town|Fairtrade Island]] status.\n\n==Bird observatory==\nFair Isle has a permanent [[bird observatory]], founded by [[George Waterston]] in 1948. Because of its importance as a [[bird migration]] watchpoint, it provides most of the accommodation on the island.<ref>{{cite book|last=Okill|first=David|first2=Deryk|last2=Shaw|year=2010|title=Bird Observatories of Britain and Ireland|contribution=Fair Isle|url=http://www.poyserbooks.com/images/Bird_Observatories_of_Britain_and_Ireland_9781408110409.pdf|editors=Archer, Mike; Grantham, Mark; Howlett, Peter; Stansfield, Steven|publisher=T & A D Poyser|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yg0Dk0ka?url=http://www.poyserbooks.com/images/Bird_Observatories_of_Britain_and_Ireland_9781408110409.pdf|archivedate=14 May 2011|deadurl=yes|df=}}</ref> The first director of the observatory was [[Kenneth Williamson]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fairislebirdobs.co.uk/history.htm |title=The History of Fair Isle Bird Observatory |publisher=fairislebirdobs.co.uk |accessdate=2008-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513125312/http://www.fairislebirdobs.co.uk/history.htm |archivedate=13 May 2008 }}</ref> It is unusual amongst bird observatories in providing catered, rather than hostel-style, accommodation.\n\nMany rare species of bird have been found on the island, and it is probably the best place in [[western Europe]] to see skulking [[Siberia]]n [[passerine]]s such as [[Pechora pipit]], [[lanceolated warbler]] and [[Pallas's grasshopper warbler]]. In spring 2008 a [[calandra lark]] was identified in April, and in May a [[Caspian plover]] was observed, only the fourth such record for the UK.<ref name=Hugh>{{cite news| author=Hughes, Mark| date=5 May 2008| title=Rare bird sends twitchers on a wild plover chase| location=London| publisher=[[The Independent]]| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/nature/rare-bird-sends-twitchers-on-a-wild-plover-chase-821129.html| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080505144852/http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/nature/rare-bird-sends-twitchers-on-a-wild-plover-chase-821129.html | archivedate=2008-05-05| accessdate=2009-07-24}}</ref> On 6 June a [[citril finch]] was found and identified by islander Tommy Hyndman, a first record for Britain. September was highlighted by [[brown flycatcher]], [[red-flanked bluetail]] and [[Siberian thrush]].\n\nFair Isle can claim to be the best place to find rare birds in Britain, with at least 27 first records. Spring 2009 started well with notable birds including [[white-tailed eagle]], [[green-winged teal]], [[red-rumped swallow]] and a [[brown-headed cowbird]] (second for Britain).  The island is home to an [[endemism|endemic]] subspecies of [[Eurasian wren]], the [[Fair Isle wren]] ''Troglodytes troglodytes fridariensis''.\n\n==Infrastructure==\n[[File:Fairislesunset.jpg|thumb|Sunset over the South Lighthouse]]\nOther than the restaurant of the Bird Observatory, and its little evening-only bar, there are no pubs or restaurants on the island. There is one shop, and one school (see below). There is a community hall available for meetings and social events.\n\n===Electricity supply===\nFair Isle is not connected to the [[National Grid (Great Britain)|National Grid]] and electricity is provided by the Fair Isle Electricity Company. From the 1980s,<ref name=\"BBC-12102018\">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-45812273|title=The glory of 24-hour power finally reaches Fair Isle|work=BBC News|first=John|last=Johnston|date=12 October 2018|accessdate=12 October 2018}}</ref> power was generated by two [[diesel generator]]s and two [[wind turbine]]s.

It was originally part of the [[Highlands and Islands Fire and Rescue Service]], which was absorbed into the national [[Scottish Fire and Rescue Service]] on 1 April 2013. A locally organised volunteer fire brigade was formed in 1996 by island residents. This was later absorbed into the statutory fire service, with professional training provided, and the local service designated a retained fire crew. The first purpose-built [[fire engine]] was stationed to the island in 2002.<ref>History of the service and the appliance recorded in [http://www.scotsman.com/news/scotland/top-stories/new-fire-stations-opened-on-fair-isle-and-whalsay-1-2837231 The Scotsman] newspaper.</ref> In October 2011 a contract for the construction of a \u00a3140,000 purpose-built fire station was awarded to Shetland company Ness Engineering,<ref>Contract award and value recorded in [http://www.shetlandtimes.co.uk/2011/10/31/work-to-begin-over-the-winter-on-long-overdue-fair-isle-fire-station/ The Shetland Times] newspaper.</ref> who completed the construction and equipping of the fire station, including its connection to the island power and water supplies, and the installation of a rain-water harvesting system within the building.<ref>Construction and design outlined by [http://www.nessengineering.com/fairislefire Ness Engineering].</ref> The new fire station was officially opened on 14 March 2013.<ref>Link to photographs of the [http://fair-isle.blogspot.co.uk/2013/03/the-opening-of-fair-isles-new-fire.html opening ceremony].</ref>\n\nThere is a small [[Her Majesty's Coastguard|Coastguard]] cliff-rescue team on the island. Like the fire service, the Coastguard is a retained (volunteer) emergency service.<ref>[http://fair-isle.blogspot.co.uk/2012/09/hm-coastguard-metal-ceremony-service.html Photographs] of Fair Isle Coastguard team members receiving long-service awards.</ref> The Fair Isle Coastguard cliff rescue team were the first British Coastguard unit to be equipped with a [[quadbike]].<ref>The quadbike is reported, with photographs, [http://fair-isle.blogspot.co.uk/2013/12/photos-about-fair-isle-december-2013.html here].</ref> The quadbike is painted in H M Coastguard livery, with reflective [[Battenburg markings]] and has an optional equipment trailer.\n\nThere are no emergency medical services on Fair Isle. Routine medical care is provided by a community nurse. In the event of accident and emergency the community nurse provides [[first aid]] until casualties can be removed to Shetland Mainland, usually by fixed-wing air ambulance. In severe weather conditions the Coastguard helicopter can sometimes undertake medical evacuations when the air ambulance is grounded.<ref>An example of such a [http://www.dft.gov.uk/mca/mcga07-home/newsandpublications/press-releases.htm?id=EDA198123A531C6A&m=4&y=2009 medical evacuation].</ref>\n\n==Transport==\n\n===Air===\n[[File:Directflight Britten-Norman BN-2B-20 Islander at Fair Isle.jpg|thumb|A [[Britten-Norman Islander]] of [[Directflight]] at [[Fair Isle Airport]] preparing for the flight to [[Tingwall Airport]] (April 2011)]]\n[[Fair Isle Airport]] serves the island with flights to [[Tingwall Airport]] near [[Lerwick]], and weekly to [[Sumburgh Airport|Sumburgh]]. Flights to [[Kirkwall Airport|Kirkwall]] are scheduled to begin in September 2017, provided by [[Loganair]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/transport/new-fair-isle-flights-from-orkney-launched-by-loganair-1-4401941 |title=New Fair Isle flights from Orkney launched by Loganair |newspaper=The Scotsman |first=Alastair |last=Dalton |date=23 March 2017 |accessdate=9 June 2017}}</ref> Private aircraft use the facility and scheduled flights arrive twice daily, three days a week. There is a small terminal building, but facilities are otherwise very limited. Fire cover is provided by the island fire service.\n\nThere is also a helipad at the South Fair Isle lighthouse, for official use by the [[Northern Lighthouse Board]] and Coastguard helicopters, and a second one at the North Fair Isle lighthouse.\n\n===Sea===\nThere are two main harbours (north harbour and south harbour), both formed naturally. The north harbour is the main route for goods, provisions, and [[Royal Mail]] postal services arriving at and departing from the island. The ferry ''[[Good Shepherd IV]]'' plies between Fair Isle north harbour and [[Grutness]] on Shetland Mainland.\n\n===Road===\nA road network connects the populated areas of the island, along its full length.\n\n==Education==\nFair Isle has one primary school, with two classrooms. There is a full-time head teacher, and a part-time assistant teacher.<ref>School [http://www.fairisle.shetland.sch.uk website].</ref> The number of pupils varies over time, but is generally between 5 and 10, with 5 pupils in 2014/2015. Islanders of secondary school age are generally educated off-island, on Shetland Mainland, where they board in halls of residence, returning to the island during holiday periods.\n\n==Religion==\nChristianity is the only formally organised religion on Fair Isle. There are two churches, one Methodist, and one [[Church of Scotland]] (Presbyterian). The Methodist Church has a resident non-stipendiary minister, who reports to a full-time minister on Shetland Mainland.<ref>Details of ministers on the [http://www.methodistchurchinshetland.org.uk Shetland Methodist website]</ref> The Methodist Church was constructed in 1886.<ref>Date referenced at [http://www.undiscoveredscotland.co.uk/fairisle/church/ Undiscovered Scotland].</ref> The Church of Scotland church was built in 1892. The Church of Scotland parish which contains Fair Isle is Dunrossness, which is linked with Sandwick, Cunningsburgh and Quarff parish. The congregation's minister is [[the Reverend]] Charles H Greig.\n\n==Wartime military role ==\nDuring the Second World War, the [[Royal Air Force]] built a [[radar station]] on top of Ward Hill {{convert|712|ft}} during the [[Battle of the Atlantic]]. The ruined buildings and [[nissen hut]]s are still present. A cable-operated [[narrow gauge railway]] lies disused, though it was once used to send supplies up to the summit of Ward Hill.\n\nOn 17 January 1941, a German [[Heinkel He 111]] bomber, modified as a meteorological aircraft, crashed on the island; wreckage remains on the crash-site to the present day.<ref name=\"crashSitesScotland\" /> The aircraft had been flying on a routine  weather reconnaissance flight from its base at [[Oldenburg]] in Germany. It was intercepted by RAF [[Hawker Hurricane]] fighters from [[No. 3 Squadron RAF|3 Squadron]], based at [[RAF Sumburgh]]; both of the aircraft's engines were damaged and several of the five crew were wounded. The pilot managed to make a crash-landing on Fair Isle to avoid ditching his crippled aircraft in the sea. Two crew died and three survived. The dead crew were buried in the island's churchyard; the survivors were detained by the islanders and remained for several days until weather conditions allowed them to be taken off the island by means of the Shetland Lifeboat.<ref name=\"crashSitesScotland\">{{cite web | url=http://www.aircrashsites-scotland.co.uk/heinkel-he111_fair-isle.htm | title=Deutsche Luftwaffe Heinkel He111 H-2 / T5+EU | publisher=Air Crash Sites Scotland | accessdate=2013-04-10}}</ref>\n\n==Climate==\nFair Isle experiences an [[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Cfb'', bordering on a [[subpolar oceanic climate]] (''Cfc''), with cool summers and mild winters. This is especially pronounced due to its location far from any sizeable landmass; Fair Isle has the smallest overall temperature range (least continental) of any weather station in the British Isles: an absolute maximum of {{convert|20.2|C|F}} and an absolute minimum of {{convert|-5.6|C|F}} since 1951. This 60+ year temperature span is actually smaller than many places in inland southern England will record within a given three-month period.\n\nThe lowest temperature recorded in recent years was {{convert|-4.6|C|F}} in February 2010.<ref>{{cite web | publisher = [[Tutiempo]] | url= http://www.tutiempo.net/en/Climate/FAIR_ISLE/02-2010/30080.htm | title = 2010 temperature}}</ref>  Rainfall, at under {{convert|1000|mm}}, is lower than one might expect for somewhere often in the main path of [[Atlantic depression]]s. This is explained by a lack of heavy [[convective rainfall]] during spring and summer months due to the absence of warm surface conditions.\n\nFair Isle's ocean moderation is so strong that areas on the same latitudes in the Scandinavian inland less than 1000 kilometres to the east have average summer highs 2\u20133 degrees higher than Fair Isle's all-time record temperature, for example the Norwegian capital of [[Oslo]] and the Swedish capital of [[Stockholm]]. The \u22125 all-time low is uniquely mild for European locations on the [[59th parallel north]]. The winter daily means are comparable to many areas as far south in the British Isles as south-central England, due to the extreme maritime moderation.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Fair Isle 57 m

Falls''''' was the third puppet TV show produced by [[Gerry Anderson]] for  [[ITV Granada|Granada Television]]. It was based on an idea by [[Barry Gray]], who also wrote the show's music.{{r|BFI4FF}} The series was the first to use an early version of Anderson's [[Supermarionation]] puppetry. Thirty-nine 13-minute episodes were produced, broadcast by Granada from February until November 1960. The setting is the late 19th-century fictional Kansas town of Four Feather Falls, where the hero of the series, Tex Tucker, is a [[sheriffs in the United States|sheriff]]. The four feathers of the title refers to four magical feathers given to Tex by the [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] [[Tribal chief|chief]] Kalamakooya as a reward for saving his grandson: two of the feathers allowed Tex's guns to swivel and fire without being touched whenever he was in danger, whilst the other two conferred the power of speech on Tex's horse and dog.\n\nTex's speaking voice was provided by [[Nicholas Parsons]], and his singing voice by [[Michael Holliday]]. The series has never been repeated on British television, but it was released on DVD in 2005.\n\n==Production==\nAmerican [[Western (genre)|Western]] television shows such as ''[[Wagon Train]]'' and ''[[Gunsmoke]]'' were popular with British audiences, therefore [[Gerry Anderson]] and his business partner [[Arthur Provis]] decided to make a [[cowboy]] series, based on an idea offered to them by [[Barry Gray]].{{r|BFI4FF}} Anderson considered the puppets with static heads, made by [[Christine Glanville]] for his earlier productions, to be unacceptable because the viewer could not tell which character was talking unless its puppet moved up or down. Anderson's aim was to make the puppets look as realistic as possible, the beginning of the [[Supermarionation]] puppetry process, although that term was not coined until his next series, ''[[Supercar (TV series)|Supercar]]''.\n\nThe puppets' [[papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9]] heads were replaced by interchangeable hollow [[fibre glass]] heads with internal rods that could move the eyes from side to side. The heads also contained sound-activated [[solenoid]]s, which allowed the puppets' lips to move automatically in synchronisation with the dialogue.{{r|NMM}} The electronics of the day required more space than would be available in a human-scale head, therefore all the puppets in ''Four Feather Falls'' had oversized heads.\n\nExcept for the pilot episode, which was made in [[AP Films]]' studios at [[Islet Park]],{{r|tv.heaven}} the series was produced in a converted warehouse in the [[Slough Trading Estate]].{{r|NMM}} The cast assembled to record each script without seeing the puppets, much like recording a radio series; synchronisation of each character's speech with the movement of its puppet's mouth was performed later.{{sfnp|Parsons|2011|loc=The Joys of Television|ps=}} The show was filmed in black and white. {{r|tv.heaven}} Its tight budget precluded the use of sophisticated [[special effects]], and less-costly alternatives were used. For example, to achieve the effect of [[muzzle flash]]es, small specks of black paint were carefully applied to the [[35 mm film|35 mm]] [[film negative|negative]]s so they would appear as white flashes on the finished prints. The wires used to control the puppets were eight feet long and made of [[tungsten]], an improvement on the curtain wire used in the two earlier series, and were only 1/200 of an inch thick. Being shiny, the wires had to be blackened. The puppets were made one-third life size with the [[puppeteer]]s on a bridge eight feet above the set. The horses moved by being pulled along on a trolley, which meant the viewer never saw their feet when they were moving.\n\n[[Continuity (fiction)|Continuity]] for the series was provided by [[Sylvia Anderson|Sylvia Thamm]] who married Gerry Anderson.\n\n==Plot==\nThe series is set in the fictitious late 19th-century [[Western (genre)|Western]] town of Four Feather Falls, Kansas, and features the adventures of its [[Sheriffs in the United States|sheriff]], Tex Tucker. In the first episode, Grandpa Twink relates the story of how it all began to grandson, Little Jake. Tex is riding up from the valley and comes across a lost and hungry [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indian]] boy, Makooya and saves him. Tex is given four [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] feathers by the boy's grandfather, chief Kalamakooya, as a reward for saving his grandson. Two of the feathers allow his guns to swivel and fire automatically (often while Tex's hands are raised),{{efn|The swivelling guns solved the problem of how a puppet cowboy could be quick on the draw without looking like he had gone into a spasm when one of his wires was suddenly yanked.{{r|BFI4FF}}}} and the other two allow his horse, Rocky, and his dog, Dusty, to speak. As Tex, his horse, and dog are very thirsty, Kalamakooya also makes a waterfall where there had been no water before, and so when the town was built it was named after Tex's feathers and the waterfall.\n\nThe characters of the town are Grandpa Twink, who does little but rest in a chair; his grandson Little Jake, the only child in town; Ma Jones, who runs the town store; Doc Haggerty; Slim Jim, the bartender of the Denison [[Western saloon|saloon]]; Marvin Jackson, the bank manager; and Dan Morse, the [[telegraph]]ist. Other characters appeared from time to time for only one episode, often just visiting town.  The villains included Pedro, who was introduced in the first show and Fernando, who first appeared in the second episode as a [[sidekick]] and someone Pedro could blame when things went wrong, as they always did. Big Ben was another villain who appeared from time to time, as did Red Scalp, a renegade Indian. Other villains only appeared in single episodes.\n\n==Episodes==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|- style=\"color:white\"\n! scope=\"col\"  style=\"background:#689BBD\"|No.\n! scope=\"col\"  style=\"background:#689BBD\"|Title\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#689BBD;\"|Directed by\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#689BBD;\"|Written by\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#689BBD;\"|Original air date\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#689BBD;\"|Production<br>code\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber=1\n| Title=How it Began\n| DirectedBy=Gerry Anderson\n| WrittenBy=Mary Cathcart Borer\n| OriginalAirDate={{Start date|1960|2|25|df=y}}\n| ProdCode=1\n| ShortSummary=Whilst out in the desert Tex Tucker finds and shelters an Indian boy and is rewarded with four magic feathers by the boy's grandfather.

The only analogue instruments were the [[Radio direction finder#Radio-magnetic indicator (RMI)|RMI]] and brake pressure indicator.]]\n'''Fly-by-wire''' ('''FBW''') is a system that replaces the conventional [[aircraft flight control system#Hydro-mechanical|manual flight controls]] of an aircraft with an [[electronics|electronic]] interface. The movements of flight controls are converted to electronic signals transmitted by wires (hence the fly-by-wire term), and flight control [[computers]] determine how to move the [[actuator]]s at each control surface to provide the ordered response. It can use [[Aircraft flight control system|mechanical flight control]] backup systems ([[Boeing 777#Fly-by-wire|Boeing 777]]) or use fully fly-by-wire controls.<ref name=suth >[http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/679158.pdf Fly by Wire Flight Control Systems] Sutherland</ref>\n\nImproved fully fly-by-wire systems interpret the pilot's control input as a desired outcome and calculates the control surface activities required to deliver that outcome; this results in different combinations of rudder, elevator, aileron, flaps and engine controls in different situations using a closed loop ([[Feedback#Electronic engineering|feedback]]). The pilot may not be fully aware of all the control outputs needed to effect a command, only that the aircraft is acting as expected. The fly-by-wire computers continually act to stabilise the aircraft and adjust its flying characteristics without the pilot's input and to prevent the pilot operating outside of the aircraft's safe [[performance envelope]].<ref name=\"Crane\">Crane, Dale: ''Dictionary of Aeronautical Terms, third edition'', page 224. Aviation Supplies & Academics, 1997. {{ISBN|1-56027-287-2}}</ref><ref name=unstable/>\n\n==Development==\nMechanical and hydro-mechanical [[aircraft flight control systems|flight control systems]] are relatively heavy and require careful routing of flight control cables through the aircraft by systems of pulleys, cranks, tension cables and hydraulic pipes. Both systems often require redundant backup to deal with failures, which increases weight. Both have limited ability to compensate for changing [[aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] conditions. Dangerous characteristics such as [[stall (flight)|stalling]], spinning and [[pilot-induced oscillation]] (PIO), which depend mainly on the stability and structure of the aircraft concerned rather than the control system itself, are depending on pilot's action.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\nThe term \"fly-by-wire\" implies a purely electrically signaled control system. It is used in the general sense of computer-configured controls, where a computer system is interposed between the operator and the final control actuators or surfaces. This modifies the manual inputs of the pilot in accordance with control parameters.<ref name=Crane/>\n\n[[Side-stick]]s, [[centre stick]]s, or conventional flight [[yoke (aircraft)|control yoke]]s can be used to fly FBW aircraft.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\n===Basic operation===\n\n====Closed feedback loop control====\n[[File:Feedback loop with descriptions.svg|thumb|right|Simple [[feedback]] loop]]\nA pilot commands the flight control computer to make the aircraft perform a certain action, such as pitch the aircraft up, or roll to one side, by moving the control column or [[sidestick]]. The flight control computer then calculates what control surface movements will cause the plane to perform that action and issues those commands to the electronic controllers for each surface.<ref name=suth/> The controllers at each surface receive these commands and then move actuators attached to the control surface until it has moved to where the flight control computer commanded it to. The controllers measure the position of the flight control surface with sensors such as [[LVDT]]s.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\n====Automatic stability systems====\nFly-by-wire control systems allow aircraft computers to perform tasks without pilot input. Automatic stability systems operate in this way. [[Gyroscope]]s fitted with [[sensor]]s are mounted in an aircraft to sense movement changes in the [[flight dynamics (aircraft)|pitch, roll and yaw axes]]. Any movement (from straight and level flight for example) results in signals to the computer, which can automatically move control actuators to stabilize the aircraft.<ref name=unstable/>\n\n===Safety and redundancy===\nWhile traditional mechanical or hydraulic control systems usually fail gradually, the loss of all flight control computers immediately renders the aircraft uncontrollable. For this reason, most fly-by-wire systems incorporate either redundant computers (triplex, quadruplex etc.), some kind of mechanical or hydraulic backup or a combination of both. A \"mixed\" control system with mechanical backup feedbacks any rudder elevation directly to the pilot and therefore makes closed loop (feedback) systems senseless.<ref name=suth/>\n\nAircraft systems may be quadruplexed (four independent channels) to prevent loss of signals in the case of failure of one or even two channels. High performance aircraft that have fly-by-wire controls (also called CCVs or Control-Configured Vehicles) may be deliberately designed to have low or even negative stability in some flight regimes {{ndash}} rapid-reacting CCV controls can electronically stabilize the lack of natural stability.<ref name=unstable>[https://jagger.berkeley.edu/~pack/me234/GSBode.pdf Respect the unstable - Berkeley Center for Control and Identification]</ref>\n\nPre-flight safety checks of a fly-by-wire system are often performed using [[built-in test equipment]] (BITE). A number of control movement steps can automatically performed, reducing workload of the [[Aviator|pilot]] or [[groundcrew]] and speeding up flight-checks.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\nSome aircraft, the [[Panavia Tornado]] for example, retain a very basic hydro-mechanical backup system for limited flight control capability on losing electrical power; in the case of the Tornado this allows rudimentary control of the [[stabilator]]s only for pitch and roll axis movements.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\n===Weight saving===\nA FBW aircraft can be lighter than a similar design with conventional controls. This is partly due to the lower overall weight of the system components, and partly because the natural stability of the aircraft can be relaxed, slightly for a transport aircraft and more for a maneuverable fighter, which means that the stability surfaces that are part of the aircraft structure can therefore be made smaller. These include the vertical and horizontal stabilizers (fin and [[tailplane]]) that are (normally) at the rear of the [[fuselage]]. If these structures can be reduced in size, airframe weight is reduced. The advantages of FBW controls were first exploited by the military and then in the commercial airline market. The Airbus series of airliners used full-authority FBW controls beginning with their A320 series, see [[A320 flight control]] (though some limited FBW functions existed on A310).<ref>Dominique Bri\u00e8re, Christian Favre, Pascal Traverse, ''Electrical Flight Controls, From Airbus A320/330/340 to Future Military Transport Aircraft: A Family of Fault-Tolerant Systems'', chapitre 12 du ''Avionics Handbook'', Cary Spitzer ed., CRC Press 2001, {{ISBN|0-8493-8348-X}}</ref> Boeing followed with their 777 and later designs.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\n===History===\n[[File:Avro Arrow rollout.jpg|thumb|right|[[Avro Canada CF-105 Arrow]], first non-experimental aircraft flown with a fly-by-wire control system]]\n[[File:F-8C FBW.jpg|thumb|right|[[F-8 Crusader|F-8C Crusader]] digital fly-by-wire testbed]]\nServo-electrically operated control surfaces were first tested in the 1930s on the Soviet [[Tupolev ANT-20]].<ref>[http://www.tupolev.ru/russian/Show.asp?SectionID=163 Official site of PSC \"Tupolev\".

The control mechanisms in the cockpit now operate signal transducers, which in turn generate the appropriate electronic commands. These are next processed by an electronic controller\u2014either an [[analogue electronics|analog]] one, or (more modernly) a [[digital electronics|digital]] one. Aircraft and [[spacecraft]] [[autopilot]]s are now part of the electronic controller.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}\n\nThe hydraulic circuits are similar except that mechanical servo valves are replaced with electrically controlled servo valves, operated by the electronic controller. This is the simplest and earliest configuration of an analog fly-by-wire flight control system. In this configuration, the flight control systems must simulate \"feel\". The electronic controller controls electrical feel devices that provide the appropriate \"feel\" forces on the manual controls. This was used in [[Concorde]], the first production fly-by-wire airliner.<ref>The Tay-Viscount was the first airliner to be fitted with electrical controls [http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1986/1986%20-%200838.html ''Flight'' 1986]</ref>\n\nIn more sophisticated versions, [[analog computer]]s replaced the electronic controller. The canceled 1950s Canadian supersonic interceptor, the [[Avro Canada CF-105 Arrow]], employed this type of system. Analog computers also allowed some customization of flight control characteristics, including [[relaxed stability]]. This was exploited by the early versions of [[F-16]], giving it impressive maneuverability.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}\n\n==Digital systems==\n[[File:Fly by wire.jpg|thumb|The NASA F-8 Crusader with its fly-by-wire system in green and Apollo guidance computer]]\nA digital fly-by-wire flight control system can be extended to its analog counterpart. The signal processing by digital computers can integrate the history and complex algorithms receiving input from any aircraft sensor (such as the [[altimeter]]s and the [[pitot tube]]s). The computers sense position and force inputs from pilot controls and aircraft sensors. They solve [[differential equation]]s to determine the appropriate command signals that move the flight controls to execute the intentions of the pilot.<ref name=avihand >{{cite web|url=http://davi.ws/avionics/TheAvionicsHandbook_Cap_12.pdf|title=The Avionics Handbook|website=davi.ws|accessdate=24 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe programming of the digital computers enable [[flight envelope protection]]. These protections are tailored to an aircraft's handling characteristics to stay within aerodynamic and structural limitations of the aircraft. For example, the computer in flight envelope protection mode can try to prevent the aircraft from being handled dangerously by preventing pilots from exceeding preset limits on the aircraft's flight-control envelope, such as those that prevent stalls and spins, and which limit airspeeds and [[g force]]s on the airplane. Software can also be included that stabilize the flight-control inputs to avoid [[pilot-induced oscillation]]s.<ref name=airbus >[https://web.archive.org/web/20090327095042if_/http://personales.upv.es/juaruiga/teaching/TFC/Material/Trabajos/AIRBUS.PDF Airbus A320/A330/A340 Electrical Flight Controls: A Family of Fault-Tolerant Systems]</ref>\n\nSince the flight-control computers continuously feedback the environment, pilot's workloads can be reduced.<ref name=airbus/> Also, in military and naval applications, it is now possible to fly [[military aircraft]] that have [[relaxed stability]]. The primary benefit for such aircraft is more maneuverability during combat and training flights, and the so-called \"carefree handling\" because stalling, spinning and other undesirable performances are prevented automatically by the computers. Digital flight control systems enable inherently unstable combat aircraft, such as the [[Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk]] and the [[Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit]] [[flying wing]] to fly in usable and safe manners.<ref name=avihand/>\n\n===Legislation===\nThe [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) of the United States has adopted the [[Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics|RTCA]]/[[DO-178C]], titled \"Software Considerations in Airborne Systems and Equipment Certification\", as the certification standard for aviation software. Any [[safety-critical]] component in a digital fly-by-wire system including [[physical law|applications of the laws]] of [[aeronautics]] and computer [[operating system]]s will need to be certified to DO-178C Level A or B, depending on the class of aircraft, which is applicable for preventing potential catastrophic failures.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aviationexplorer.com/Fly_By_Wire_Aircraft.html|title=Fly-By-Wire Aircraft Facts History Pictures and Information|last=Explorer|first=Aviation|website=www.aviationexplorer.com|access-date=2016-10-13}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, the top concern for computerized, digital, fly-by-wire systems is reliability, even more so than for analog electronic control systems. This is because the digital computers that are running software are often the only control path between the pilot and aircraft's [[flight control surfaces]]. If the computer software crashes for any reason, the pilot may be unable to control an aircraft. Hence virtually all fly-by-wire flight control systems are either triply or quadruply [[redundancy (engineering)|redundant in their computers and electronics]]. These have three or four flight-control computers operating in parallel, and three or four separate [[Bus (computing)|data buses]] connecting them with each control surface.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}\n\n===Redundancy===\nThe multiple redundant flight control computers continuously monitor each other's output. If one computer begins to give aberrant results for any reason, potentially including software or hardware failures or flawed input data, then the combined system is designed to exclude the results from that computer in deciding the appropriate actions for the flight controls. Depending on specific system details there may be the potential to reboot an aberrant flight control computer, or to reincorporate its inputs if they return to agreement. Complex logic exists to deal with multiple failures, which may prompt the system to revert to simpler back-up modes.<ref name=avihand/><ref name=airbus/>\n\nIn addition, most of the early digital fly-by-wire aircraft also had an analog electrical, a mechanical, or a hydraulic back-up flight control system. The Space Shuttle has, in addition to its redundant set of four [[digital computer]]s running its primary flight-control software, a fifth back-up computer running a separately developed, reduced-function, software flight-control system \u2013 one that can be commanded to take over in the event that a fault ever affects all of the computers in the other four. This back-up system serves to reduce the risk of total flight-control-system failure ever happening because of a general-purpose flight software fault that has escaped notice in the other four computers.<ref name=suth/><ref name=avihand/>\n\n===Efficiency of flight===\nFor airliners, flight-control redundancy improves their safety, but fly-by-wire control systems, which are physically lighter and have lower maintenance demands than conventional controls also improve economy, both in terms of cost of ownership and for in-flight economy. In certain designs with limited relaxed stability in the pitch axis, for example the Boeing 777, the flight control system may allow the aircraft to fly at a more aerodynamically efficient angle of attack than a conventionally stable design. Modern airliners also commonly feature computerized Full-Authority Digital Engine Control systems ([[FADEC]]s) that control their [[jet engine]]s, air inlets, fuel storage and distribution system, in a similar fashion to the way that FBW controls the flight control surfaces.

On modern military aircraft other systems such as autostabilization, navigation, radar and weapons system are all integrated with the flight control systems. FADEC allows maximum performance to be extracted from the aircraft without fear of engine misoperation, aircraft damage or high pilot workloads.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\nIn the civil field, the integration increases flight safety and economy. The Airbus A320 and its fly-by-wire brethren are protected from dangerous situations such as low-speed stall or overstressing by [[flight envelope protection]]. As a result, in such conditions, the flight control systems commands the engines to increase thrust without pilot intervention. In economy cruise modes, the flight control systems adjust the throttles and fuel tank selections more precisely than all but the most skillful pilots. FADEC reduces rudder drag needed to compensate for sideways flight from unbalanced engine thrust. On the A330/A340 family, fuel is transferred between the main (wing and center fuselage) tanks and a fuel tank in the horizontal stabilizer, to optimize the aircraft's center of gravity during cruise flight. The fuel management controls keep the aircraft's center of gravity accurately trimmed with fuel weight, rather than drag-inducing aerodynamic trims in the elevators.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\n==Further developments==\n\n===Fly-by-optics<!--This section is linked from Airship Industries-->===\nFly-by-optics is sometimes used instead of fly-by-wire because it offers a higher data transfer rate, immunity to electromagnetic interference, and lighter weight. In most cases, the cables are just changed from electrical to [[optical fiber]] cables. Sometimes it is referred to as \"fly-by-light\" due to its use of fiber optics. The data generated by the software and interpreted by the controller remain the same.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} Fly-by-light has the effect of decreasing electro-magnetic disturbances to sensors in comparison to more common fly-by-wire control systems. The [[Kawasaki P-1]] is the first production aircraft in the world to be equipped with such a flight control system.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.iiss.org/en/militarybalanceblog/blogsections/2015-090c/september-a013/japans-p1-leads-defence-export-drive-125e|title=Japans P1 leads defence export drive|website=www.iiss.org|accessdate=24 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Power-by-wire===\nHaving eliminated the mechanical transmission circuits in fly-by-wire flight control systems, the next step is to eliminate the bulky and heavy hydraulic circuits. The hydraulic circuit is replaced by an electrical power circuit. The power circuits power electrical or self-contained electrohydraulic actuators that are controlled by the digital flight control computers. All benefits of digital fly-by-wire are retained.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nThe biggest benefits are weight savings, the possibility of redundant power circuits and tighter integration between the aircraft flight control systems and its avionics systems. The absence of hydraulics greatly reduces maintenance costs. This system is used in the [[Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II]] and in [[Airbus A380]] backup flight controls. The [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner|Boeing 787]] and [[Airbus A350]] also incorporate electrically powered backup flight controls which remain operational even in the event of a total loss of hydraulic power.<ref>[http://www.fzt.haw-hamburg.de/pers/Scholz/dglr/hh/text_2007_09_20_A350XWB.pdf A350 XWB family & technologies]</ref>\n\n===Fly-by-wireless===\nWiring adds a considerable amount of weight to an aircraft; therefore, researchers are exploring implementing fly-by-wireless solutions. Fly-by-wireless systems are very similar to fly-by-wire systems, however, instead of using a wired protocol for the [[physical layer]] a wireless protocol is employed.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nIn addition to reducing weight, implementing a wireless solution has the potential to reduce costs throughout an aircraft's life cycle. For example, many key failure points associated with wire and connectors will be eliminated thus hours spent troubleshooting wires and connectors will be reduced. Furthermore, engineering costs could potentially decrease because less time would be spent on designing wiring installations, late changes in an aircraft's design would be easier to manage, etc.<ref>[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20070013704_2007011172.pdf \"Fly-by-Wireless\": A Revolution in Aerospace Vehicle Architecture for Instrumentation and Control]</ref>\n\n===Intelligent flight control system===\nA newer flight control system, called [[intelligent flight control system]] (IFCS), is an extension of modern digital fly-by-wire flight control systems. The aim is to intelligently compensate for aircraft damage and failure during flight, such as automatically using engine thrust and other avionics to compensate for severe failures such as loss of hydraulics, loss of rudder, loss of ailerons, loss of an engine, etc. Several demonstrations were made on a flight simulator where a [[Cessna]]-trained small-aircraft pilot successfully landed a heavily damaged full-size concept jet, without prior experience with large-body jet aircraft. This development is being spearheaded by [[NASA]] [[Armstrong Flight Research Center|Dryden Flight Research Center]].<ref>[http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/news/FactSheets/FS-076-DFRC.html Intelligent Flight Control System]. ''IFCS Fact Sheet''. NASA. Retrieved 8 June 2011.</ref> It is reported that enhancements are mostly software upgrades to existing fully computerized digital fly-by-wire flight control systems. The [[Dassault Falcon 7X]] and [[Embraer Legacy 500]] business jets have flight computers that can partially compensate for engine-out scenarios by adjusting thrust levels and control inputs, but still require pilots to respond appropriately.<ref>[http://www.flyingmag.com/aircraft/jets/fly-by-wire-fact-versus-science-fiction Flying Magazine Fly by Wire]. \"Fly by Wire: Fact versus Science Fiction\".

It began on Friday, 2 April 1982, when [[1982 invasion of the Falkland Islands|Argentina invaded]] and [[Occupation of the Falkland Islands|occupied the Falkland Islands]] (and, [[Invasion of South Georgia|the following day, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]]) in an attempt to establish [[Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute|the sovereignty it had claimed over them]]. On 5 April, the British government dispatched a naval [[task force]] to engage the [[Argentine Navy]] and [[Argentine Air Force|Air Force]] before making an [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious assault]] on the islands. The conflict lasted 74 days and ended with the Argentine surrender on 14 June 1982, returning the islands to British control. In total, 649 Argentine military personnel, 255 British military personnel, and three Falkland Islanders<!-- Please don't change these figures without discussing in talk. Thanks. --> died during the hostilities.\n\nThe conflict was a major episode in the [[History of the Falkland Islands|protracted confrontation]] over the territories' [[sovereignty]]. Argentina asserted (and maintains) that the islands are Argentine territory,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nationalturk.com/en/argentina-to-reaffirm-sovereignty-rights-over-the-falkland-islands-15712 |title= Argentine to reaffirm Sovereignty Rights over The Falkland Islands |publisher= National Turk |accessdate=7 January 2012}}</ref> and the Argentine government thus characterised its military action as the reclamation of its own territory. The British government regarded the action as an invasion of a territory that had been a [[Crown colony]] since 1841. [[Falkland Islanders]], who have inhabited the islands since the early 19th century, are predominantly descendants of British settlers, and strongly [[Falkland Islands status referendum, 1986|favour British sovereignty]]. Neither state officially [[Declaration of war|declared war]], although both governments declared the Islands a war zone.  Hostilities were almost exclusively limited to the territories under dispute and the area of the South Atlantic where they lie.\n\nThe conflict has had a strong effect in both countries and has been the subject of various [[Cultural impact of the Falklands War|books, articles, films, and songs]]. Patriotic sentiment ran high in Argentina, but the outcome prompted large protests against the [[Proceso de Reorganizacion Nacional|ruling military government]], hastening its downfall. In the United Kingdom, the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government, bolstered by the successful outcome, [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|was re-elected with an increased majority the following year]].

The longest and only paved runway was at the capital, [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]], and even that was too short to support fast jets (although an [[Arresting gear|arrestor gear]] was fitted in April to support Skyhawks). Therefore, the Argentines were forced to launch their major strikes from the mainland, severely hampering their efforts at forward staging, [[combat air patrol]]s, and [[close air support]] over the islands. The effective loiter time of incoming Argentine aircraft was low, and they were later compelled to overfly British forces in any attempt to attack the islands.\n\nThe first major Argentine strike force comprised 36 aircraft ([[Douglas A-4 Skyhawk|A-4 Skyhawks]], [[IAI Nesher|IAI Daggers]], [[English Electric Canberra]]s, and [[Dassault Mirage III|Mirage III]] escorts), and was sent on 1 May, in the belief that the British invasion was imminent or landings had already taken place. Only a section of Grupo 6 (flying IAI Dagger aircraft) found ships, which were firing at Argentine defences near the islands. The Daggers managed to attack the ships and return safely. This greatly boosted morale of the Argentine pilots, who now knew they could survive an attack against modern warships, protected by radar ground clutter from the Islands and by using a late [[Toss bombing|pop up]] profile. Meanwhile, other Argentine aircraft were intercepted by [[BAE Sea Harrier]]s operating from {{HMS|Invincible|R05|6}}.

Both sides refused to fight at the other's best altitude, until two Mirages finally descended to engage. One was shot down by an [[AIM-9 Sidewinder|AIM-9L Sidewinder]] [[air-to-air missile]] (AAM), while the other escaped but was damaged and without enough fuel to return to its mainland air base.

The decoying would be later extended with the formation of the [[Escuadr\u00f3n F\u00e9nix]], a squadron of civilian jets flying 24 hours-a-day simulating strike aircraft preparing to attack the fleet.

The first naval loss was the [[World War II|Second World War]]-vintage Argentine [[light cruiser]] {{ship|ARA|General Belgrano}}. The [[nuclear submarine|nuclear-powered submarine]] {{HMS|Conqueror|S48|6}} sank ''General Belgrano'' on 2 May. Three hundred and twenty-three members of ''General Belgrano''{{'}}s crew died in the incident. More than 700 men were rescued from the open ocean despite cold seas and stormy weather. The losses from ''General Belgrano'' totalled nearly half of the Argentine deaths in the Falklands conflict and the loss of the ship hardened the stance of the Argentine government.\n\nRegardless of [[ARA General Belgrano#Controversy over the sinking|controversies over the sinking]]\u2014including disagreement about the exact nature of the maritime exclusion zone and whether ''General Belgrano'' had been returning to port at the time of the sinking\u2014it had a crucial strategic effect: the elimination of the Argentine naval threat. After her loss, the entire Argentine fleet, with the exception of the conventional submarine {{ship|ARA|San Luis|S-32|6}},<ref name=\"handle.dtic.mil\"/> returned to port and did not leave again during the fighting. The two escorting [[destroyer]]s and the battle group centred on the aircraft carrier {{ship|ARA|Veinticinco de Mayo|V-2|6}} both withdrew from the area, ending the direct threat to the British fleet that their [[pincer movement]] had represented. \n\nHowever, settling the controversy in 2003, the ship's captain Hector Bonzo confirmed that ''General Belgrano'' had actually been manoeuvering, not \"sailing away\" from the exclusion zone, and had  orders to sink \"any British ship he could find\". Further, Captain Bonzo stated that any suggestion that HMS ''Conqueror''{{'s}} actions were a \"betrayal\" was utterly wrong; rather, the submarine carried out its duties according to the accepted rules of war.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/may/25/uk.world|website=[[The Guardian]]|title=Belgrano crew 'trigger happy'|author=Peter Beaumont|date=25 May 2003|accessdate=20 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn a separate incident later that night, British forces engaged an Argentine patrol gunboat, the {{ship|ARA|Alferez Sobral|A-9|6}}, that was searching for the crew of the Argentine Air Force Canberra light bomber shot down on 1 May. Two Royal Navy [[Westland Lynx|Lynx]] helicopters fired four [[Sea Skua]] missiles at her.

She was struck amidships, with devastating effect, ultimately killing 20 crew members and severely injuring 24 others. The ship was abandoned several hours later, gutted and deformed by the fires that continued to burn for six more days. She finally sank outside the [[Total Exclusion Zone|Maritime Exclusion Zone]] on 10 May.\n\nThe incident is described in detail by Admiral [[Sandy Woodward]] in his book ''One Hundred Days'', in Chapter One. Woodward was a former commanding officer of ''Sheffield''.<ref>{{harvnb|Woodward|Robinson|1997|p=8}}</ref> The destruction of ''Sheffield'' (the first Royal Navy ship sunk in action since the Second World War) had a profound impact on the British public, bringing home the fact that the \"Falklands Crisis\", as the [[BBC News]] put it, was now an actual \"shooting war\".\n\nThe tempo of operations increased throughout the first half of May as the United Nations' attempts to mediate a peace were rejected by the Argentinians. The final British negotiating position was presented to Argentina by UN Secretary General [[P\u00e9rez de Cu\u00e9llar]] on 18 May 1982. In it, the British abandoned their previous \"red-line\" that British administration of the islands should be restored on the withdrawal of Argentinian forces, as supported by [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 502]]. Instead, it proposed a UN administrator should supervise the mutual withdrawal of both Argentinian and British forces, then govern the islands in consultation with the representative institutions of the islands, including Argentines, although no Argentines lived there. Reference to \"[[self-determination]]\" of the islanders was dropped and the British proposed that future negotiations over the sovereignty of the islands should be conducted by the UN.<ref>[[Charles Moore (journalist)|Charles Moore]], ''Margaret Thatcher: The Authorized Biography'' (2013) Volume 1, pp. 726\u2013728</ref>\n\n===British special forces operations===\nGiven the threat to the British fleet posed by the Etendard-Exocet combination, plans were made to use C-130s to fly in some [[Special Air Service|SAS]] troops to attack the home base of the five Etendards at [[R\u00edo Grande, Tierra del Fuego]].

Now, with the British troops on the ground, the [[Argentine Air Force]] began the night bombing campaign against them using [[English Electric Canberra|Canberra]] bomber planes until the last day of the war (14 June).\n\n[[File:HMS Antelope 1982.jpg|thumb|left|{{HMS|Antelope|F170|6}} smoking after being hit, 23 May]]\n[[File:HMS Coventry D118.jpg|thumb|left|{{HMS|Coventry|D118|6}}]]\nAt sea, the paucity of the British ships' anti-aircraft defences was demonstrated in the sinking of {{HMS|Ardent|F184|6}} on 21 May, {{HMS|Antelope|F170|6}} on 24 May, and {{ship|MV|Atlantic Conveyor}} (struck by two AM39 Exocets) on 25 May along with a vital cargo of [[helicopter]]s, runway-building equipment and tents.

However, many British ships escaped being sunk because of weaknesses of the Argentine pilots' bombing tactics described below.\n\nTo avoid the highest concentration of British air defences, Argentine pilots released ordnance from very low altitude, and hence their bomb [[fuze]]s<!--For anyone tempted to correct the \"mis-spelling\", 'fuze' is a component of a bomb, 'fuse' is an electrical component, 'fuze' is correct in this instance --> did not have sufficient time to arm before impact. The low release of the [[retarded bomb]]s (some of which the British had sold to the Argentines years earlier) meant that many never exploded, as there was insufficient time in the air for them to arm themselves.\n\nA simple free-fall bomb in a low altitude release, impacts almost directly below the aircraft, which is then within the lethal fragmentation zone of the explosion. A retarded bomb has a small parachute or air brake that opens to reduce the speed of the bomb to produce a safe horizontal separation between the bomb and the aircraft. The <!--For anyone tempted to correct the \"mis-spelling\", 'fuze' is a component of a bomb, 'fuse' is an electrical component, 'fuze' is correct in this instance -->fuze for a retarded bomb requires that the retarder be open a minimum time to ensure safe separation. The pilots would have been aware of this\u2014but due to the high concentration required to avoid [[Surface-to-air missiles|SAMs]], [[Anti-Aircraft Artillery]] (AAA), and British [[BAE Sea Harrier|Sea Harriers]], many failed to climb to the necessary release point. The Argentine forces solved the problem by fitting improvised [[Gravity bomb|retarding devices]], allowing the pilots to effectively employ low-level bombing attacks on 8 June.\n\nIn his autobiographical account of the Falklands War, Admiral Woodward blamed the [[BBC World Service]] for disclosing information that led the Argentines to change the retarding devices on the bombs. The World Service reported the lack of detonations after receiving a briefing on the matter from a [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] official. He describes the BBC as being more concerned with being \"fearless seekers after truth\" than with the lives of British servicemen.<ref name=\"Woodward\">{{harvnb|Woodward|Robinson|1997}}{{Page needed|date=September 2011}}</ref> Colonel [['H'.

A 13-strong Argentine Army Commando detachment (Captain Jos\u00e9 Vercesi's 1st Assault Section, 602nd Commando Company) found itself trapped in a small shepherd's house at Top Malo. The Argentine commandos fired from windows and doorways and then took refuge in a stream bed {{convert|200|m|ft|-2}} from the burning house. Completely surrounded, they fought 19 M&AWC marines under Captain Rod Boswell for 45 minutes until, with their ammunition almost exhausted, they elected to surrender.\n\nThree Cadre members were badly wounded.

During this build-up, the Argentine air assaults on the British naval forces continued, killing 56. Of the dead, 32 were from the [[Welsh Guards]] on [[RFA Sir Galahad (1966)|RFA ''Sir Galahad'']] and [[RFA Sir Tristram (L3505)|RFA ''Sir Tristram'']] on 8 June. According to Surgeon-Commander Rick Jolly of the Falklands Field Hospital, more than 150 men suffered burns and injuries of some kind in the attack, including, famously, [[Simon Weston]].<ref>Rick Jolly, ''The Red & Green Life Machine'', p. 124.</ref>\n\nThe Guards were sent to support an advance along the southern approach to Stanley. On 2 June, a small advance party of 2 Para moved to Swan Inlet house in a number of Army [[Westland Scout]] helicopters. Telephoning ahead to [[Fitzroy, Falkland Islands|Fitzroy]], they discovered that the area was clear of Argentines and (exceeding their authority) commandeered the one remaining [[Boeing Chinook (UK variants)|RAF Chinook]] helicopter to frantically ferry another contingent of 2 Para ahead to Fitzroy (a settlement on Port Pleasant) and [[Bluff Cove]] (a settlement on Port Fitzroy).\n\nThis uncoordinated advance caused great difficulties in planning for the commanders of the combined operation, as they now found themselves with a {{convert|30|mi|km}} string of indefensible positions on their southern flank. Support could not be sent by air as the single remaining Chinook was already heavily oversubscribed. The soldiers could march, but their equipment and heavy supplies would need to be ferried by sea.\n\nPlans were drawn up for half the Welsh Guards to march light on the night of 2 June, whilst the Scots Guards and the second half of the Welsh Guards were to be ferried from San Carlos Water in the [[Landing Ship Logistics]] (LSL) ''Sir Tristram'' and the [[amphibious transport dock|landing platform dock]] (LPD) ''Intrepid'' on the night of 5 June. ''Intrepid'' was planned to stay one day and unload itself and as much of ''Sir Tristram'' as possible, leaving the next evening for the relative safety of San Carlos. Escorts would be provided for this day, after which ''Sir Tristram'' would be left to unload using a [[Mexeflote]] (a powered raft) for as long as it took to finish.\n\nPolitical pressure from above to not risk the LPD forced Commodore Clapp to alter this plan. Two lower-value LSLs would be sent, but with no suitable beaches to land on, ''Intrepid''{{'}}s [[landing craft]] would need to accompany them to unload. A complicated operation across several nights with ''Intrepid'' and her sister ship {{HMS|Fearless|L10|2}} sailing half-way to dispatch their craft was devised.\n\nThe attempted overland march by half the Welsh Guards failed, possibly as they refused to march light and attempted to carry their equipment. They returned to San Carlos and landed directly at Bluff Cove when ''Fearless'' dispatched her landing craft. ''Sir Tristram'' sailed on the night of 6 June and was joined by ''Sir Galahad'' at dawn on 7 June. Anchored {{convert|1200|ft|m}} apart in Port Pleasant, the landing ships were near Fitzroy, the designated landing point.\n\nThe landing craft should have been able to unload the ships to that point relatively quickly, but confusion over the ordered disembarkation point (the first half of the Guards going direct to Bluff Cove) resulted in the senior Welsh Guards infantry officer aboard insisting that his troops should be ferried the far longer distance directly to Port Fitzroy/Bluff Cove. The alternative was for the infantrymen to march via the recently repaired Bluff Cove bridge (destroyed by retreating Argentine [[combat engineering|combat engineers]]) to their destination, a journey of around {{convert|7|mi|km|spell=in}}.\n\nOn ''Sir Galahad''{{'}}s stern ramp there was an argument about what to do. The officers on board were told that they could not sail to Bluff Cove that day. They were told that they had to get their men off ship and onto the beach as soon as possible as the ships were vulnerable to enemy aircraft. It would take 20 minutes to transport the men to shore using the LCU and Mexeflote. They would then have the choice of walking the seven miles to Bluff Cove or wait until dark to sail there. The officers on board said that they would remain on board until dark and then sail. They refused to take their men off the ship. They possibly doubted that the bridge had been repaired due to the presence on board ''Sir Galahad'' of the [[Royal Engineer]] Troop whose job it was to repair the bridge. The Welsh Guards were keen to rejoin the rest of their Battalion, who were potentially facing the enemy without their support. They had also not seen any enemy aircraft since landing at [[San Carlos, Falkland Islands|San Carlos]] and may have been overconfident in the air defences. [[Ewen Southby-Tailyour]] gave a direct order for the men to leave the ship and go to the beach, the order was ignored.<ref name=\"SouthbyTailyour1990\">{{cite book|author=Ewen Southby-Tailyour|title=Reasons in Writing: A Commando's View of the Falklands War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0NWkAwAAQBAJ|date=31 December 1990|publisher=Pen and Sword|isbn=978-1-84415-014-4|page=297}} ''\"It was clear that I was achieving nothing and so, in desperation, I gave a direct order for the infantry to get ashore with or without their kit in order that we could get on with unloading Sir Tristram.<br />  The officers ignored my order.

This had disastrous consequences. Without escorts, having not yet established their air defence, and still almost fully laden, the two LSLs in Port Pleasant were sitting targets for two waves of Argentine [[Douglas A-4 Skyhawk|A-4 Skyhawks]].\n\nThe disaster at Port Pleasant (although often known as Bluff Cove) would provide the world with some of the most sobering images of the war as TV news video footage showed [[Royal Navy|Navy]] helicopters hovering in thick smoke to winch survivors from the burning landing ships.\n\n[[File:Cardiff anchored outside Port Stanley.JPG|thumb|right|HMS ''Cardiff'' anchored outside Port Stanley at the end of hostilities in 1982]]\n\nBritish casualties were 48 killed and 115 wounded.<ref>{{Cite journal |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/8/newsid_2500000/2500607.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=1982:Fifty die in Argentine air attack}}</ref> Three Argentine pilots were also killed.

Mount Harriet was taken at a cost of 2 British and 18 Argentine soldiers. At Two Sisters, the British faced both enemy resistance and [[friendly fire]], but managed to capture their objectives.

On the Argentine side beside the Military Hospital at Port Stanley, the [[Argentine Air Force Mobile Field Hospital]] was deployed at [[Comodoro Rivadavia]].\n\n===Red Cross Box===\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2014}}\n\nBefore British offensive operations began, the British and Argentine governments agreed to establish an area on the high seas where both sides could station hospital ships without fear of attack by the other side. This area, a circle 20 nautical miles in diameter, was referred to as the Red Cross Box ({{coord|48|30|S|53|45|W|scale:10000000}}), about {{convert|45|mi|km}} north of [[Falkland Sound]]. Ultimately, the British stationed four ships ({{HMS|Hydra|A144|6}}, {{HMS|Hecla|A133|6}} and {{HMS|Herald|H138|6}} and the primary hospital ship [[SS Uganda (1952)|SS ''Uganda'']]) within the box, while the Argentines stationed three ({{ship|ARA|Almirante Ir\u00edzar|Q-5|6}}, ''Bahia Paraiso'' and {{ship|ARA|Puerto Deseado|Q-20|2}}).\n\n[[File:HMS Hecla 1982 Gibraltar.jpg|thumb|''Hecla'' at HM Naval Base Gibraltar, during conversion to a hospital ship for service during the Falklands War]]\nThe hospital ships were non-warships converted to serve as hospital ships. The three British naval vessels were survey vessels and ''Uganda'' was a passenger liner. ''Almirante Irizar'' was an icebreaker, ''Bahia Paraiso'' was an Antarctic supply transport and ''Puerto Deseado'' was a survey ship. The British and Argentine vessels operating within the Box were in radio contact and there was some transfer of patients between the hospital ships. For example, the ''Uganda'' on four occasions transferred patients to an Argentine hospital ship. The British naval hospital ships operated as casualty ferries, carrying casualties from both sides from the Falklands to ''Uganda'' and operating a shuttle service between the Red Cross Box and Montevideo.\n\nThroughout the conflict officials of the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) conducted inspections to verify that all concerned were abiding by the rules of the Geneva Conventions. On 12 June, some personnel were transferred from the Argentine hospital ship to the British ships by helicopter. Argentine naval officers also inspected the British casualty ferries in the estuary of the [[R\u00edo de la Plata|River Plate]].\n\n===British casualty evacuation===\n''Hydra'' worked with ''Hecla'' and ''Herald'', to take casualties from ''Uganda'' to [[Montevideo]], Uruguay, where a fleet of Uruguayan ambulances met them. [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] [[VC10]] aircraft then flew the casualties to the UK for transfer to the [[RAF Princess Alexandra Hospital|Princess Alexandra Hospital]] at [[RAF Wroughton]], near [[Swindon]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://natowatch.org/node/1558|title=NATO's Ebola 'capability gap': where are the hospital ships?|last=Davis|first=Ian|date=17 October 2014|website=NATO Watch|publisher=NATO|access-date=2 February 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{Main article|Aftermath of the Falklands War}}[[File:Malvimasmemorial.jpg|thumb|left|The ''Monumento a los Ca\u00eddos en Malvinas'' (\"Monument for the Fallen in the Falklands\") in [[Plaza San Mart\u00edn (Buenos Aires)|Plaza San Mart\u00edn]], Buenos Aires; a member of the historic ''Patricios'' regiment stands guard{{refn|Buenos Aires War Memorial is at coordinates {{Coord|-34.59373|-58.374782|type:landmark|name=Buenos Aires War Memorial}}|group=nb}}]]\n\nThis brief war brought many consequences for all the parties involved, besides the considerable casualty rate and large [[materiel]] loss, especially of shipping and aircraft, relative to the deployed military strengths of the opposing sides.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, Margaret Thatcher's popularity increased. The success of the Falklands campaign was widely regarded as a factor in the turnaround in fortunes for the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government, who had been trailing behind the [[SDP-Liberal Alliance]] in the opinion polls for months before the conflict began, but after the success in the Falklands the Conservatives returned to the top of the opinion polls by a wide margin and went on to win the following year's [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|general election]] by a landslide.<ref>{{Cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/vote_2005/basics/4393313.stm |title= 1983: Thatcher triumphs again |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=8 June 2010 | date=5 April 2005}}</ref> Subsequently, Defence Secretary Nott's proposed cuts to the Royal Navy were abandoned.\n\nThe islanders subsequently had full British citizenship restored in 1983, their lifestyle was improved by investments the UK made after the war and by the liberalisation of economic measures that had been stalled through fear of angering Argentina. In 1985, a [[Constitution of the Falkland Islands|new constitution]] was enacted promoting self-government, which has continued to devolve power to the islanders.\n\n[[File:1982 Liberation Memorial in Stanley (5612271774).jpg|thumb|upright|The [[1982 Liberation Memorial]] in [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]], [[Falkland Islands]]{{refn|1982 Liberation Memorial is at coordinates {{Coord|-51.691395|-57.867298|type:landmark|name=1982 Liberation Memorial}}|group=nb}}]]\nIn Argentina, the Falklands War meant that a [[Beagle conflict|possible war with Chile]] was avoided. Further, Argentina returned to a democratic government in the [[Argentine general election, 1983|1983 general election]], the first free general election since 1973. It also had a major social impact, destroying the military's image as the \"moral reserve of the nation\" that they had maintained through most of the 20th century.\n\nVarious figures have been produced for the number of veterans who have committed [[suicide]] since the war.

As such, it has been the subject of intense study by military analysts and historians. The most significant \"lessons learned\" include: the vulnerability of surface ships to anti-ship missiles and submarines, the challenges of co-ordinating logistical support for a long-distance projection of power, and reconfirmation of the role of tactical air power, including the use of helicopters.\n\nIn 1986, the [[BBC]] broadcast the ''[[Horizon (BBC TV series)|Horizon]]'' programme, ''In the Wake of HMS Sheffield'', which discussed lessons learned from the conflict, and measures since taken to implement them, such as [[stealth ship]]s and [[close-in weapon system]]s.\n\n===Memorials===\nThere are several memorials on the Falkland Islands themselves, the most notable of which is the [[1982 Liberation Memorial]], unveiled in 1984 on the second anniversary of the end of the war. It lists the names of the 255 British military personnel who died during the war and is located in front of the Secretariat Building in Stanley, overlooking [[Stanley Harbour]].

The UK reported six military personnel were injured in 1982 and a further two injured in 1983. Most military accidents took place while clearing the minefields in the immediate aftermath of the 1982 conflict or in the process of trying to establish the extent of the minefield perimeters, particularly where no detailed records existed.\n\nOn 9 May 2008, the Falkland Islands Government asserted that the minefields, which represent 0.1% of the available farmland on the islands \"present no long term social or economic difficulties for the Falklands,\" and that the impact of clearing the mines would cause more problems than containing them.

Several accounts of how he originally defined his scale exist. The lower defining point, 0&nbsp;\u00b0F, was established as the [[temperature]] of a solution of [[brine]] made from equal parts of ice, water and salt (ammonium chloride).<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2018-02-09|title=Fahrenheit: Facts, History & Conversion Formulas|url=https://www.livescience.com/39916-fahrenheit.html|website=Live Science}}</ref> Further limits were established as the melting point of ice (32&nbsp;\u00b0F) and his best estimate of the average [[human body temperature]] (96&nbsp;\u00b0F, about 2.6&nbsp;\u00b0F less than the modern value due to a later redefinition of the scale).<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/science/Fahrenheit-temperature-scale Fahrenheit temperature scale], Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online. 25 September 2015</ref> The scale is now usually defined by two fixed points: the temperature at which [[water]] freezes into [[ice]] is defined as 32&nbsp;\u00b0F, and the boiling point of water is defined to be 212&nbsp;\u00b0F, a 180&nbsp;\u00b0F separation, as defined at sea level and standard atmospheric pressure.\n\nAt the end of the 2010s, Fahrenheit was used as the official temperature scale only in the [[United States]] (including its [[Unincorporated territories of the United States|unincorporated territories]]), its [[Compact of Free Association|freely associated states]] in the Western Pacific ([[Palau]], the [[Federated States of Micronesia]] and the [[Marshall Islands]]), the [[The Bahamas|Bahamas]], the [[Cayman Islands]] and [[Liberia]]. [[Antigua and Barbuda]] and other islands which use the same meteorological service, such as [[Anguilla]], the [[British Virgin Islands]], [[Montserrat]] and [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]], as well as [[Bermuda]], [[Belize]] and the [[Turks and Caicos Islands]], use Fahrenheit and [[Celsius]]. All other countries in the world officially now use the Celsius scale, named after [[Swedish people|Swedish]] [[astronomer]] [[Anders Celsius]].\n\n==Definition and conversion==\n{{temperature}}\nOn the Fahrenheit scale, the [[freezing point]] of [[water]] is 32&nbsp;degrees&nbsp;Fahrenheit (\u00b0F) and the [[boiling point]] is 212&nbsp;\u00b0F (at [[standard atmospheric pressure]]). This puts the boiling and freezing points of water 180&nbsp;degrees apart.<ref name=\"rank\"/> Therefore, a degree on the Fahrenheit scale is {{frac|1|180}} of the interval between the freezing point and the boiling point. On the Celsius scale, the freezing and boiling points of water are 100&nbsp;degrees apart. A temperature interval of 1&nbsp;\u00b0F is equal to an interval of {{frac|5|9}}&nbsp;degrees Celsius. The Fahrenheit and Celsius scales intersect at \u221240\u00b0 (i.e., \u221240&nbsp;\u00b0F = \u221240&nbsp;\u00b0C).\n\n[[Absolute zero]] is \u2212273.15&nbsp;\u00b0C or \u2212459.67&nbsp;\u00b0F.

He invented the [[mercury thermometer]] (first practical, accurate [[thermometer]]) and Fahrenheit scale (first widely used, standardized [[temperature scale]]).]]\nFahrenheit proposed his temperature scale in 1724, basing it on two reference points of temperature. In his initial scale (which is not the final Fahrenheit scale), the zero point was determined by placing the [[thermometer]] in  a mixture of [[ice]], water, and [[ammonium chloride]] (''salis Armoniaci'').<ref>\"Sal Armoniac\" was an impure form of ammonium chloride.  The French chemist [[Nicolas Lemery|Nicolas L\u00e9mery]] (1645 \u2013 1715) discussed it in his book ''Cours de Chymie'' (A Course of Chemistry, 1675), describing where it occurs naturally and how it can be prepared artificially.  It occurs naturally in the deserts of northern Africa, where it forms from puddles of animal urine.  It can be prepared artificially by boiling 5 parts of urine, 1 part of sea salt, and \u00bd part of chimney soot until the mixture has dried.  The mixture is then heated in a sublimation pot until it sublimates ; the sublimated crystals are ''sal Armoniac''.  See:\n*  Nicolas L\u00e9mery, ''Cours de chymie'' \u2026 , 7th ed.

In any case, the definition of the Fahrenheit scale has changed since.\n\nAccording to a letter Fahrenheit wrote to his friend [[Herman Boerhaave]],<ref>Ernst Cohen and W.A.T. Cohen-De Meester. ''Chemisch Weekblad'', volume 33 (1936), pages 374\u2013393, cited and translated in http://www.sizes.com:80/units/temperature_Fahrenheit.htm</ref> his scale was built on the work of [[Ole R\u00f8mer]], whom he had met earlier. In [[R\u00f8mer scale|R\u00f8mer's scale]], brine freezes at zero, water freezes and melts at 7.5&nbsp;degrees, body temperature is 22.5, and water boils at 60&nbsp;degrees. Fahrenheit multiplied each value by four in order to eliminate fractions and increase the [[granularity]] of the scale. He then re-calibrated his scale using the melting point of ice and normal human body temperature (which were at 30 and 90 degrees); he adjusted the scale so that the melting point of ice would be 32 degrees and body temperature 96 degrees, so that 64 intervals would separate the two, allowing him to mark degree lines on his instruments by simply bisecting the interval six times (since 64 is 2 to the sixth power).<ref name=TMU>{{Cite book |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-71590-4 |last=Frautschi |first=Steven C. |author2=Richard P.
