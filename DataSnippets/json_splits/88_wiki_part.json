As the first non-[[Franks|Frankish]] king, he established the [[Ottonian Dynasty]] of kings and [[Holy Roman Emperor|emperor]]s, and he is generally considered to be the founder and first king of the [[medieval]] [[Kingdom of Germany|German state]], known until then as East Francia. An avid [[hunter]], he obtained the epithet \"the Fowler\"<ref>A fowler is one who hunts [[wildfowl]].</ref> because he was allegedly fixing his [[birding]] nets when [[Courier|messenger]]s arrived to inform him that he was to be king. \n\nHe was born into the [[Ottonian dynasty|Liudolfing]] line of [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxon duke]]s. His father [[Otto I of Saxony]] died in 912 and was succeeded by Henry. The new duke launched a [[rebellion]] against the king of East Francia, [[Conrad I of Germany]], over the rights to lands in the [[Duchy of Thuringia]]. They reconciled in 915 and on his deathbed in 918, Conrad recommended Henry as the next king, considering the duke the only one who could hold the kingdom together in the face of internal revolts and external [[Magyar tribes|Magyar]] [[Hungarian invasions of Europe|raids]]. \n\nHenry was elected and crowned king in 919. He went on to defeat the rebellious dukes of [[Arnulf of Bavaria|Bavaria]] and [[Burchard II of Swabia|Swabia]], consolidating his rule. Through successful warfare and a dynastic marriage, Henry acquired [[Lotharingia]] as a [[vassal]] in 925. Unlike his [[Carolingian]] predecessors, Henry did not seek to create a centralized monarchy, ruling through federated autonomous [[stem duchies]] instead. Henry built an extensive system of [[fortifications]] and mobile [[heavy cavalry]] across Germany to neutralize the Magyar threat and in 933 routed them at the [[Battle of Riade]], ending Magyar attacks for the next 21 years and giving rise to a sense of German nationhood. Henry greatly expanded German hegemony in Europe with his defeat of the Slavs in 929 at the [[Battle of Lenzen]] along the [[Elbe]] river, by compelling the submission of Duke [[Wenceslaus I, Duke of Bohemia|Wenceslaus I of Bohemia]] through an invasion of the [[Duchy of Bohemia]] the same year and by conquering [[Danes|Danish]] realms in [[Schleswig]] in 934. Henry's hegemonic status north of the Alps was acknowledged by King [[Rudolph of France|Rudolph of West Francia]] and King [[Rudolph II of Burgundy|Rudolph II of Upper Burgundy]], who both accepted a place of subordination as allies in 935. Henry planned an expedition to [[Rome]] to be crowned as [[Holy Roman Emperor]] by the [[Pope]], but the design was thwarted by a hunting accident near the royal palace of [[Bodfeld]] in the autumn of 935 that mortally injured him.\n\nHenry prevented a collapse of royal power, as had happened in [[West Francia]], and left a much stronger kingdom to his successor [[Otto I]]. Henry died of a [[stroke]] on 2 July 936 in his [[Kaiserpfalz|royal palace]] in [[Memleben]], one of his favourite places. He was buried at [[Quedlinburg Abbey]], established by his wife [[Matilda of Ringelheim|Matilda]] in his honor.\n\n==Family==\nBorn in [[Memleben]], in what is now [[Saxony-Anhalt]], Henry was the son of [[Otto the Illustrious]], Duke of Saxony, and his wife [[Hedwiga]], daughter of [[Henry of Franconia]] and Ingeltrude and a great-great-granddaughter of [[Charlemagne]]. In 906 he married [[Hatheburg of Merseburg]], daughter of the Saxon count Erwin. She had previously been a nun. The marriage was annulled in 909 because her vows as a nun were deemed by the church to remain valid. She had already given birth to Henry's son [[Thankmar]]. The annulment placed a question mark over Thankmar's legitimacy. Later that year he married [[Matilda of Ringelheim|Matilda]], daughter of [[Dietrich of Ringelheim]], Count in [[Westphalia]]. Matilda bore him three sons, one called [[Otto I|Otto]], and two daughters, [[Hedwig of Saxony|Hedwig]] and [[Gerberga of Saxony|Gerberga]], and founded many religious institutions, including the [[Quedlinburg Abbey]] where Henry is buried. She was later [[canonization|canonized]].\n\n==Rule==\n[[File:Heinrich-der-finkler-darbringung-der-kaiserkrone.jpg|thumb|Legend of the German crown offered to Henry, [[Hermann Vogel (German illustrator)|Hermann Vogel]] (1854\u20131921)]]\nHenry became Duke of Saxony after his father's death in 912. An able ruler, he continued to strengthen the position of his duchy within the weakening kingdom of [[East Francia]], and was frequently in conflict with his neighbors to the South in [[Duchy of Franconia]].\n\nOn 23 December 918 [[Conrad I of Germany|Conrad I]], king of East Francia and Franconian duke, died. Although Henry had rebelled against Conrad I between 912 and 915 over the lands in [[Thuringia]], Conrad recommended Henry as his successor. Kingship now changed from Franks to [[Saxons]], who had suffered greatly during the conquests of Charlemagne and were proud of their identity. Henry, as Saxon, was the first non-Frank on the throne.\n\nConrad's choice was conveyed by his brother, duke [[Eberhard III of Franconia]] at the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] of [[Fritzlar]] in 919. The assembled Franconian and Saxon nobles elected Henry to be king with other regional dukes not participating in election. Archbishop Heriger of [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Mainz]] offered to [[Anointing|anoint]] Henry according to the usual ceremony, but he refused - the only king of his time not to undergo that rite - allegedly because he wished to be king not by the church's but by the people's acclaim.\n\nHenry, who was elected to kingship by only Saxons and Franconians at Fritzlar, had to subdue other dukes. Duke [[Arnulf of Bavaria]] did not submit until Henry defeated him in two campaigns in 921. Henry besieged his residence at Ratisbon ([[Regensburg]]) and forced Arnulf into submission. Arnulf had crowned himself as king of Bavaria in 919, but in 921 renounced crown and submitted to Henry while maintaining large autonomy and the right to mint his own coins. Duke [[Burchard II of Swabia]] soon swore fealty to the new King, but when he died, Henry appointed a noble from Franconia to be the new duke.\n\nHenry was too weak to impose absolutist rule, and regarded his kingdom as a confederation of [[stem duchies]] rather than as a feudal monarchy and saw himself as ''[[primus inter pares]] (first among equals)''. Instead of seeking to administer the empire through counts, as Charlemagne had done and as his successors had attempted, Henry allowed the local dukes in [[Duchy of Franconia]], [[Duchy of Swabia]], and [[Duchy of Bavaria]] to maintain large internal autonomy.\n\n===Wars over Lotharingia===\n[[File:Lotharingia-959.svg|thumb|Map of Lotharingia in the 10th century.]]\n{{main|Lotharingia}}\nIn 920 king of [[West Francia]] [[Charles the Simple]] invaded and marched as far as [[Pfeddersheim]] near [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], but retreated when he learned that Henry was organizing an army.<ref>Gwatkin ,''The Cambridge Medieval History: Volume III. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1926.''p 180</ref> On 7 November 921, Henry and Charles met and concluded the [[Treaty of Bonn]], which they called a pact of friendship. Henry then saw an opportunity to wrest [[Lotharingia]] when a civil war over royal succession began in West Francia after coronation of king [[Robert I of France|Robert I]]. In 923 Henry crossed the Rhine twice, capturing a large part of the duchy. The eastern part of Lotharingia was left in Henry's possession until October 924.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n\nIn 925 duke [[Gilbert, Duke of Lorraine|Gilbert of Lotharingia]] rebelled. Henry invaded the duchy and besieged Gilbert at [[Z\u00fclpich]] (Tolbiac), captured the town, and became master of a large portion of his lands. Allowing Gilbert to remain in power as duke, Henry arranged the marriage of his daughter Gerberga to his new vassal in 928. Thus he brought that realm, which had been lost in 910, back into the kingdom as the fifth stem duchy.\n\n===Wars with Magyars===\nThe threat of Magyar raiders improved his situation, as all the dukes and nobles realized that only a strong state could defend their lands against barbarian incursions.\n\nIn 919 Henry was defeated by the Magyars in the [[Battle of P\u00fcchen]],{{cn|date=November 2017}} hardly escaping from being killed in battle, managing to take refuge in the town of P\u00fcchen.<ref>Thietmari Merseburgensis Episcopi Chronicon, [http://www.dmgh.de/de/fs1/object/goToPage/bsb00000689.html?pageNo=21 Die Chronik des Bischofs Thietmar von Merseburg und ihre Korveier \u00dcberarbeitung] herausg. von Robert Holtzmann. Berlin Weidmannsche Buchhandlung, 1935, p. 21-22 Latin original text: \"''Rex autem Avares sepenumero insurgentes expulit.

And when he once, with insufficient forces, dared to attack them, he was defeated and fled in a city, with the name Bichni [P\u00fcchen]. Because he there escaped death, so he gave the citizens the same greater privileges than they had before, and which have no match among their countrymen until this day, and besides that, he gave them rich presents too\"</ref>\n\nIn 921 [[Magyars]] once again invaded East Francia and Italy. Although a sizable Magyar force was defeated near  [[Bleiburg]] in the Bavarian [[March of Carinthia]] by Eberhard and the Count of Meran<ref>Menzel, W. Germany from the Earliest Period</ref> and another group was routed by [[Liutfried]], count of [[Elsass]] (French reading: [[Alsace]]), the Magyars continued raiding East Francia.\n\nHenry, having captured a Hungarian prince, managed to arrange a ten-year-truce in 924, though he agreed to pay annual tribute. By doing so he and dukes gained time to build new fortified towns and to train a new elite cavalry force.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Leyser|first1=Karl|title=Medieval Germany and Its Neighbours 900-1250|date=1982|publisher=The   Hambledon Press|location=London|isbn=978-0907628088|page=13|edition=1st}}</ref> Henry built fortified settlements as a defense against Magyar and Slav invaders. In 932 Henry refused to pay the annual tribute to Magyars. When they began raiding again, Henry, with his improved army in 933 at the [[Battle of Riade]] crushed Magyars so completely, that they never returned to the northern lands of Henry\u2019s kingdom.<ref>[https://books.google.lv/books?id=hFcHAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA5&dq=conrad+I+of+germany&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=snippet&q=duke%20henry%20saxony&f=false A Short History of Germany]</ref>\n\n===Wars with Slavs===\nDuring the truce with the Magyars, Henry subdued the [[Polabian Slavs]] who lived on his eastern borders. In the winter of 928 he marched against the Slavic [[Hevelli]] tribes and seized their capital, [[Brandenburg an der Havel|Brandenburg]]. He then invaded the [[Glomacze]] lands on the middle [[Elbe]] river, conquering the capital Gana (Jahna) after a [[Siege of Gana|siege]], and had a fortress (the later [[Albrechtsburg]]) built at [[Meissen]]. In 929, with the help of Arnulf of Bavaria, Henry entered [[Duchy of Bohemia]] and forced Duke [[Wenceslaus I, Duke of Bohemia|Wenceslaus I]] to resume the annual payment of tribute to the king.<ref>''Bohemia to the Extinction of the Premyslids'', Kamil Krofta, ''The Cambridge Medieval History: Victory of the Papacy'', Vol. VI, ed.

Counts Bernard and Thietmar marched against the fortress of [[Lenzen]] beyond the Elbe, and, after fierce [[Battle of Lenzen|fighting]], completely routed the enemy on 4 September 929. The [[Germans|Lusatians]] and the [[Ukrani]] on the lower [[Oder]] were subdued and made tributary in 932 and 934, respectively.<ref>Gwatkin, The Cambridge Medieval History: Volume III.</ref> In conquered lands Henry did not create [[March (territory)|march]] administration, which was implemented by his successor Otto I.\n\n===Wars with Danes===\nHenry also pacified territories to the north, where the [[Denmark|Danes]] had been harrying the [[Frisians]] by sea. The monk and chronicler [[Widukind of Corvey]] in his ''Res gestae Saxonicae'' reports that the Danes were subjects of Henry the Fowler. {{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} Henry incorporated into his kingdom territories held by the [[Wends]], who together with the Danes had attacked Germany, and also conquered [[Schleswig]] in 934.<ref>[https://books.google.lv/books?id=hFcHAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA5&dq=conrad+I+of+germany&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=snippet&q=duke%20henry%20saxony&f=false A Short History of Germany]</ref>\n\n==Family and children==\n{{Ottonian dynasty}}\n{{main article|Ottonian dynasty}}\n\nAs the first Saxon king of East Francia, Henry was the founder of the [[Ottonian dynasty]].

After the attempts to achieve German national unity failed with the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|Revolutions of 1848]], Wagner strongly relied on the picture of Henry as the actual ruler of all German tribes as advocated by [[Pan-Germanism|pan-Germanist]] activists like [[Friedrich Ludwig Jahn]].\n\nThere are indications that [[Heinrich Himmler]] saw himself as the reincarnation of Henry, who was proclaimed to be the first king of Germany.<ref>Frischauer, Willi.

His father [[Hamilcar Barca]] was the leading Carthaginian commander during the [[First Punic War]]. His younger brothers were [[Mago Barca|Mago]] and [[Hasdrubal Barca|Hasdrubal]], and he was brother-in-law to [[Hasdrubal the Fair]].\n\nHannibal lived during a period of great tension in the western Mediterranean Basin, when the [[Roman Republic]] established its supremacy over other great powers such as ancient Carthage, the [[Etruscans]], the [[Samnites]], and the Greek kingdom of [[Syracuse, Sicily#Greek period|Syracuse]]. One of his most famous achievements was at the outbreak of the [[Second Punic War]], when he [[Hannibal's crossing of the Alps|marched an army]] which included war elephants from [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]] over the [[Pyrenees]] and the [[Alps]] into Italy. In his first few years in Italy, he won dramatic victories at [[Battle of the Trebia|the Trebia]], [[Battle of Lake Trasimene|Lake Trasimene]], and [[Battle of Cannae|Cannae]]. He distinguished himself for his ability to determine his and his opponent's respective strengths and weaknesses, and to plan battles accordingly. Hannibal's well-planned strategies allowed him to conquer many allies of Rome. \n\nHannibal occupied much of Italy for 15 years but was unable to march on Rome. An enemy counter-invasion of North Africa forced him to return to Carthage, where he was decisively defeated by [[Scipio Africanus]] at the [[Battle of Zama]]. Scipio had studied Hannibal's tactics and brilliantly devised some of his own, and he finally defeated Rome's nemesis at Zama, having previously driven Hannibal's brother Hasdrubal out of the Iberian Peninsula.\n\nAfter the war, Hannibal successfully ran for the office of [[shophet|sufet]]. He enacted political and financial reforms to enable the payment of the war indemnity imposed by Rome; however, those reforms were unpopular with members of the Carthaginian aristocracy and in Rome, and he fled into voluntary exile. During this time, he lived at the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]] court, where he acted as military advisor to [[Antiochus III the Great]] in his war against Rome. Antiochus met defeat at the [[Battle of Magnesia]] and was forced to accept Rome's terms, and Hannibal fled again, making a stop in the [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]]. His flight ended in the court of [[Bithynia]], where he achieved an outstanding naval victory against a fleet from [[Pergamon]]. He was afterwards betrayed to the Romans and committed suicide by poisoning himself.\n\nHannibal is often regarded as one of the greatest military strategists in history and one of the greatest generals of Mediterranean antiquity, together with [[Philip of Macedon]], [[Alexander the Great]], [[Julius Caesar]], and [[Scipio Africanus]]. [[Plutarch]] states that Scipio asked Hannibal who was the greatest general, and Hannibal replied either Alexander or [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]], then himself<ref>\"Plutarch, and when asked what his choices would be if he had beaten Scipio, he replied that he would be the best of them all\" ''Life of Titus Flamininus'' 21.3\u20134.</ref> (or Pyrrhus, Scipio, then himself, according to another version of the event).<ref>Plutarch, ''Life of Pyrrhus'' 8.2.</ref> Military historian [[Theodore Ayrault Dodge]] called Hannibal the \"father of strategy\",<ref name=\"dodge\">{{cite book|title=Hannibal: A History of the Art of War Among the Carthaginians and Romans Down to the Battle of Pydna, 168 BC|first=Theodore |last=Ayrault Dodge|publisher=Da Capo Press |year=1995}}</ref> because his enemy Rome adopted elements of his military tactics in its own strategic arsenal. This praise has earned him a strong reputation in the modern world, and he was regarded as a great strategist by [[Napoleon]] and others.\n\n==Name==\nThe [[anglicisation of names|English form]] of the name is derived from the [[latinisation of names|Latin]]. [[Greek historiography|Greek historians]] rendered the name as ''Ann\u00edbas B\u00e1rkas'' ({{lang|grc|\u1f08\u03bd\u03bd\u03af\u03b2\u03b1\u03c2 \u0392\u03ac\u03c1\u03ba\u03b1\u03c2}}).\n\nHannibal was his [[given name]].

Its precise vocalization remains a matter of debate.

Lancel, ''Hannibal'' p.6.</ref>\n\nIn English, his clan are sometimes collectively known as the [[Barcids]]. As with [[Greek name|Greek]] and [[Roman naming conventions|Roman practice]], [[patronymic]]s were a common part of Carthaginian nomenclature, so that Hannibal would also have been known as \"Hannibal son of Hamilcar\".<ref>Ameling, Walter ''Karthago: Studien zu Milit\u00e4r, Staat und Gesellschaft'' pp. 81\u20132.</ref>\n\n==Background and early career==\n[[File:Hasdrubal coin.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A Carthaginian coin depicting [[Hasdrubal Barca]] (245\u2013207 BC), one of Hannibal's younger brothers, wearing a ''[[diadem]]'']]\n[[File:Dishekel hispano-cartagin\u00e9s-2.jpg|thumb|A [[Carthaginian currency|Carthaginian]] [[shekel]], dated 237\u2013227 BC, depicting the Punic god [[Melqart]] (equivalent of [[Hercules]]/[[Heracles]]), most likely with the features of [[Hamilcar Barca]], father of Hannibal Barca; on the reverse is a man riding an elephant]]\n[[File:Carthage, quarter shekel, 237-209 BC, SNG BM Spain 102.jpg|alt=|thumb|A [[Carthaginian currency|quarter shekel]] of Carthage, perhaps minted in Spain; the obverse may depict Hannibal with the traits of a young [[Melqart]]; the reverse features one of his famous [[war elephants]].<ref>''Sylloge Nummorum Graecorum, Great Britain, Volume IX, British Museum, Part 2: Spain'', London, 2002, n\u00b0 102.</ref>]]\n\nHannibal was one of the sons of [[Hamilcar Barca]], a Carthaginian leader. He was born in what is present day Tunisia. He had several sisters and two brothers, [[Hasdrubal Barca|Hasdrubal]] and [[Mago Barca|Mago]]. His brothers-in-law were [[Hasdrubal the Fair]] and the [[Numidians|Numidian]] king [[Naravas]]. He was still a child when his sisters married, and his brothers-in-law were close associates during his father's struggles in the [[Mercenary War]] and the Punic conquest of the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. In light of Hamilcar Barca's cognomen, historians refer to Hamilcar's family as the Barcids. However, there is debate as to whether the cognomen Barca (meaning \"thunderbolt\") was applied to Hamilcar alone or was hereditary within his family. If the latter, then Hannibal and his brothers also bore the name \"Barca\".<ref>Lancel, S. ''Hannibal'' p.6.</ref>\n\nAfter Carthage's defeat in the [[First Punic War]], Hamilcar set out to improve his family's and Carthage's fortunes. With that in mind and supported by [[C\u00e1diz|Gades]], Hamilcar began the subjugation of the tribes of the Iberian Peninsula. Carthage at the time was in such a poor state that it lacked a navy able to transport his army; instead, Hamilcar had to march his forces across [[Numidia]] towards the [[Pillars of Hercules]] and then cross the [[Strait of Gibraltar]].<ref>[[Gavin de Beer|De Beer, Sir Gavin]] (1969). ''Hannibal: Challenging Rome's Supremacy'' p.91.</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Polybius]], Hannibal much later said that when he came upon his father and begged to go with him, Hamilcar agreed and demanded that he swear that as long as he lived he would never be a friend of Rome. There is even an account of him at a very young age (9 years old) begging his father to take him to an overseas war. In the story, Hannibal's father took him up and brought him to a sacrificial chamber. Hamilcar held Hannibal over the fire roaring in the chamber and made him swear that he would never be a friend of Rome. Other sources report that Hannibal told his father, \"I swear so soon as age will permit...I will use fire and steel to arrest the destiny of Rome.\"<ref name=\"dodge\"/><ref>[http://www.reversespins.com/patton.html Reverse Spins] ''Patton, the Second Coming of Hannibal''.</ref> According to the tradition, Hannibal's oath took place in the town of [[Pe\u00f1\u00edscola]], today part of the [[Valencian Community]], Spain.<ref>Hilowitz, Beverley (1974).

Hasdrubal pursued a policy of consolidation of Carthage's Iberian interests, even signing a [[treaty]] with Rome whereby Carthage would not expand north of the [[Ebro]] so long as Rome did not expand south of it.<ref>[[Gavin de Beer|De Beer, Sir Gavin]] (1969).

His following campaign in 220 BC was against the [[Vaccaei]] to the west, where he stormed the Vaccaen strongholds of Helmantice and Arbucala. On his return home, laden with many spoils, a coalition of Spanish tribes, led by the [[Carpetani]], attacked, and Hannibal won his first major battlefield success and showed off his tactical skills at the battle of the River Tagus.<ref>Hoyos, D. ''Hannibal's Dynasty: Power and Politics in the Western Mediterranean, 247\u2013183 BC'', pp. 89\u201391, 2003</ref> However, Rome, fearing the growing strength of Hannibal in Iberia, made an alliance with the city of [[Sagunto|Saguntum]], which lay a considerable distance south of the River Ebro and claimed the city as its [[protectorate]]. Hannibal not only perceived this as a breach of the treaty signed with Hasdrubal, but as he was already planning an attack on Rome, this was his way to start the war. So he laid [[siege]] to the city, which fell after eight months.<ref>[[Gavin de Beer|De Beer, Sir Gavin]] (1969). ''Hannibal: Challenging Rome's Supremacy'' p.112-113.</ref>\n\nHannibal sent the booty from Saguntum to Carthage, a shrewd move which gained him much support from the government; Livy records that only [[Hanno the Great#Hanno II the Great|Hanno II the Great]] spoke against him.<ref>{{cite web|title=''The History of Rome: Vol III''|url=http://www.brainfly.net/html/books/brn0131c.htm}}, by Livy</ref> In Rome, the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] reacted to this apparent violation of the treaty by dispatching a delegation to Carthage to demand whether Hannibal had destroyed Saguntum in accordance with orders from Carthage.

He maintained this post for eight years until 221&nbsp;BC. Soon the Romans became aware of an alliance between Carthage and the [[Celts]] of the [[Po Valley]] in [[Northern Italy]]. The Celts were amassing forces to invade farther south in Italy, presumably with Carthaginian backing. Therefore, the Romans preemptively invaded the Po region in 225&nbsp;BC. By 220&nbsp;BC, the Romans had annexed the area as [[Cisalpine Gaul]].<ref>Fagan, Garret G. \"The History of Ancient Rome\". Lecture 13: \"The Second Punic War\". Teaching Company, \"Great Courses\" series.</ref> Hasdrubal was assassinated around the same time (221&nbsp;BC), bringing Hannibal to the fore. It seems that the Romans lulled themselves into a false sense of security, having dealt with the threat of a Gallo-Carthaginian invasion, and perhaps knowing that the original Carthaginian commander had been killed.\n\nHannibal departed [[Cartagena, Spain|New Carthage]] in late spring of 218&nbsp;BC.<ref>{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Lancel|first=Serge|authorlink=Serge Lancel|title=Hannibal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6uVh2FH-LF4C&pg=PA225|year=1999|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0-631-21848-7}}, p. 225</ref> He fought his way through the northern tribes to the foothills of the [[Pyrenees]], subduing the tribes through clever mountain tactics and stubborn fighting. He left a detachment of 20,000 troops to garrison the newly conquered region. At the Pyrenees, he released 11,000 Iberian troops who showed reluctance to leave their homeland.

Hannibal's army numbered 38,000 infantry, 8,000 cavalry, and 38 elephants, almost none of which would survive the harsh conditions of the Alps.<ref>{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Lancel|first=Serge|authorlink=Serge Lancel|title=Hannibal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6uVh2FH-LF4C&pg=PA225|year=1999|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0-631-21848-7}}, p. 60]</ref>\n\n[[File:Heinrich Leutemann - Hannibals \u00dcbergang \u00fcber die Alpen (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|left|Hannibal and his men crossing the [[Alps]].]]\n\nHannibal outmaneuvered the natives who had tried to prevent his crossing, then evaded a Roman force marching from the Mediterranean coast by turning inland up the valley of the Rh\u00f4ne. His exact route over the Alps has been the source of scholarly dispute ever since (Polybius, the surviving ancient account closest in time to Hannibal's campaign, reports that the route was already debated). The most influential modern theories favor either a march up the valley of the [[Dr\u00f4me (river)|Dr\u00f4me]] and a crossing of the main range to the south of the modern highway over the [[Col de Montgen\u00e8vre]] or a march farther north up the valleys of the [[Is\u00e8re (river)|Is\u00e8re]] and [[Arc (Savoie)|Arc]] crossing the main range near the present [[Mont Cenis|Col de Mont Cenis]] or the [[Little St Bernard Pass]].<ref>Montgen\u00e8vre: [[Peter Connolly]], ''Hannibal and the Enemies of Rome'' (1978); ([http://www.livius.org/ha-hd/hannibal/alps.html extensive summary]); [[Col de la Traversette]]: Gavin de Beer, ''Alps and Elephants'' and [[Napoleon III]]; Mahaney 2008, \"Hannibal's Odyssey; Environmental Background to the Alpine Invasion of Italia\"; Mont Cenis: Denis Proctor, ''Hannibal's March in History''.

Hunt responds to this by proposing that Hannibal's Celtic guides purposefully misguided the Carthaginian general.\n\nBy Livy's account, the crossing was accomplished in the face of huge difficulties.<ref>Livy History of Rome book21,36</ref> These Hannibal surmounted with ingenuity, such as when he used [[fire-setting|vinegar and fire]] to break through a rockfall.<ref>Livy History of Rome, Book 21 sections 32\u201336</ref> According to Polybius, he arrived in Italy accompanied by 20,000-foot soldiers, 4,000 horsemen, and only a few elephants. The fired rockfall event is mentioned only by Livy; Polybius is mute on the subject and there is no evidence<ref>Mahaney, W.C., et al., 2009. \"The Traversette rockfall: geomorphological reconstruction and importance in interpreting classical history.\" Archaeometry, v. 52, no. 1, pp. 156\u2013172.</ref> of carbonized rock at the only two-tier rockfall in the Western Alps, located below the [[Col de la Traversette]] (Mahaney, 2008). If Polybius is correct in his figure for the number of troops that he commanded after the crossing of the Rh\u00f4ne, this would suggest that he had lost almost half of his force. Historians such as Serge Lancell have questioned the reliability of the figures for the number of troops that he had when he left Hispania.<ref>S. Lancel, ''Hannibal'' (1995; English translation 1999) page 60.</ref> From the start, he seems to have calculated that he would have to operate without aid from Hispania.\n\nHannibal's vision of military affairs was derived partly from the teaching of his Greek tutors and partly from experience gained alongside his father, and it stretched over most of the Hellenistic World of his time. Indeed, the breadth of his vision gave rise to his grand strategy of conquering Rome by opening a northern front and subduing allied city-states on the peninsula, rather than by attacking Rome directly. Historical events which led to the defeat of Carthage during the First Punic War when his father commanded the Carthaginian Army also led Hannibal to plan the invasion of Italy by land across the Alps.\n\nThe task was daunting, to say the least. It involved the mobilization of between 60,000 and 100,000 troops and the training of a war-elephant corps, all of which had to be provisioned along the way. The alpine invasion of Italy was a military operation that would shake the Mediterranean World of 218&nbsp;BC with repercussions for more than two decades.\n\n===Battle of Trebia===\n{{Main article|Battle of the Trebia}}\n[[File:Battle trebia.gif|thumb|right|300px|A diagram depicting the tactics used in the [[Battle of the Trebia]]]]\nHannibal's perilous march brought him into the Roman territory and frustrated the attempts of the enemy to fight out the main issue on foreign ground. His sudden appearance among the [[Gaul]]s of the Po Valley, moreover, enabled him to detach those tribes from their new allegiance to the Romans before the Romans could take steps to check the rebellion. [[Publius Cornelius Scipio]] was the consul who commanded the Roman force sent to intercept Hannibal (he was also Scipio Africanus' father). He had not expected Hannibal to make an attempt to cross the Alps, since the Romans were prepared to fight the war in the Iberian Peninsula. With a small detachment still positioned in Gaul, Scipio made an attempt to intercept Hannibal. He succeeded, through prompt decision and speedy movement, in transporting his army to Italy by sea in time to meet Hannibal. Hannibal's forces moved through the Po Valley and were engaged in the [[Battle of Ticinus]]. Here, Hannibal forced the Romans to evacuate the plain of [[Lombardy]], by virtue of his superior [[cavalry]].<ref name=\"dodge_old\">[[Theodore Ayrault Dodge|Dodge, Theodore]]. ''Hannibal''. Cambridge Massachusetts: De Capo Press, 1891 {{ISBN|0-306-81362-9}}</ref> The victory was minor, but it encouraged the Gauls and Ligurians to join the Carthaginian cause, whose troops bolstered his army back to around 40,000 men. Scipio was severely injured, his life only saved by the bravery of his son who rode back onto the field to rescue his fallen father. Scipio retreated across the Trebia to camp at [[Piacenza|Placentia]] with his army mostly intact.<ref name=\"dodge_old\" />\n\nThe other [[Roman consul]]ar army was rushed to the Po Valley. Even before news of the defeat at Ticinus had reached Rome, the Senate had ordered Consul [[Tiberius Sempronius Longus (consul 218 BC)|Tiberius Sempronius Longus]] to bring his army back from Sicily to meet Scipio and face Hannibal. Hannibal, by skillful maneuvers, was in position to head him off, for he lay on the direct road between Placentia and Arminum, by which Sempronius would have to march to reinforce Scipio. He then captured Clastidium, from which he drew large amounts of supplies for his men. But this gain was not without loss, as Sempronius avoided Hannibal's watchfulness, slipped around his flank, and joined his colleague in his camp near the [[Trebbia|Trebia River]] near [[Piacenza|Placentia]]. There Hannibal had an opportunity to show his masterful military skill at the Trebia in December of the same year, after wearing down the superior Roman [[infantry]], when he cut it to pieces with a surprise attack and ambush from the flanks.\n\n===Battle of Lake Trasimene===\n{{Main article|Battle of Lake Trasimene}}\nHannibal quartered his troops for the winter with the Gauls, whose support for him had abated. In the spring of 217&nbsp;BC, Hannibal decided to find a more reliable base of operations farther south. Gnaeus Servilius and Gaius Flaminius (the new consuls of Rome) were expecting Hannibal to advance on Rome, and they took their armies to block the eastern and western routes that Hannibal could use.<ref>Polybius, ''Histories'', Book III, 77</ref>\n[[File:Battle of lake trasimene.gif|right|300px|thumb|[[Battle of Lake Trasimene]], 217&nbsp;BC.<br />From the Department of History, United States Military Academy]]\nThe only alternative route to central Italy lay at the mouth of the [[Arno]]. This area was practically one huge marsh, and happened to be overflowing more than usual during this particular season. Hannibal knew that this route was full of difficulties, but it remained the surest and certainly the quickest way to central Italy. [[Polybius]] claims that Hannibal's men marched for four days and three nights, \"through a land that was under water\", suffering terribly from fatigue and enforced want of sleep. He crossed without opposition over both the [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]] (during which he lost his right eye<ref>{{cite book |author1=John Selby Watson |author2=Marcus Junianus |author3=Justinus, Cornelius |author4=Nepos, Eutropius | url = https://books.google.com/?id=7KuFCUqLA8gC&pg=RA1-PA421&vq=right+eye&dq=hannibal+greatest | title = Justin, Cornelius Nepos, and Eutropius: Literally Translated, with Notes | year = 1853 | publisher = H.

As Polybius recounts, \"he [Hannibal] calculated that, if he passed the camp and made a descent into the district beyond, Flaminius (partly for fear of popular reproach and partly of personal irritation) would be unable to endure watching passively the devastation of the country but would spontaneously follow him... and give him opportunities for attack.\"<ref>[[B. H. Liddell Hart|Liddell Hart, B. H.]], ''Strategy'', New York City, New York, Penguin Group, 1967</ref> At the same time, Hannibal tried to break the allegiance of Rome's allies by proving that Flaminius was powerless to protect them. Despite this, Flaminius remained passively encamped at Arretium. Hannibal marched boldly around Flaminius' left flank, unable to draw him into battle by mere devastation, and effectively cut him off from Rome (thus executing the first recorded [[turning movement]] in military history). He then advanced through the uplands of [[Etruria]], provoking Flaminius into a hasty pursuit and catching him in a [[defile (geography)|defile]] on the shore of [[Lake Trasimeno|Lake Trasimenus]]. There Hannibal destroyed Flaminius' army in the waters or on the adjoining slopes, killing Flaminius as well (see [[Battle of Lake Trasimene]]). This was the most costly ambush that the Romans ever sustained until the [[Battle of Carrhae]] against the [[Parthian Empire]].\n\nHannibal had now disposed of the only field force that could check his advance upon Rome, but he realized that, without [[siege engine]]s, he could not hope to take the capital. He preferred to exploit his victory by entering into central and southern Italy and encouraging a general revolt against the sovereign power.<ref>[http://www.iwar.org.uk/military/resources/hannibal/Parker_J_P_01.pdf USAWC] ''Comparing Strategies of the 2nd Punic War'' by James Parker.

Departing from Roman military traditions, Fabius adopted the [[Fabian strategy|strategy named after him]], avoiding open battle while placing several Roman armies in Hannibal's vicinity in order to watch and limit his movements.\n\nHannibal ravaged Apulia but was unable to bring Fabius to battle, so he decided to march through [[Samnium]] to [[Campania]], one of the richest and most fertile provinces of Italy, hoping that the devastation would draw Fabius into battle. Fabius closely followed Hannibal's path of destruction, yet still refused to let himself be drawn out of the defensive. This strategy was unpopular with many Romans, who believed that it was a form of cowardice.\n\nHannibal decided that it would be unwise to winter in the already devastated lowlands of Campania, but Fabius had ensured that all the passes were blocked out of Campania. To avoid this, Hannibal deceived the Romans into thinking that the Carthaginian army was going to escape through the woods. As the Romans moved off towards the woods, Hannibal's army occupied the pass, and then made their way through the pass unopposed. Fabius was within striking distance but in this case his caution worked against him. Smelling a stratagem (rightly), he stayed put. For the winter, Hannibal found comfortable quarters in the [[Apulia]]n plain. What Hannibal achieved in extricating his army was, as [[Adrian Goldsworthy]] puts it, \"a classic of ancient generalship, finding its way into nearly every historical narrative of the war and being used by later military manuals\".<ref>Goldsworthy, Adrian K. ''The Roman Army at War 100 BC&nbsp;\u2014 AD 200'', New York</ref> This was a severe blow to Fabius' prestige and soon after this his period of dictatorial power ended.\n\n===Battle of Cannae===\n[[File:Battle cannae destruction.gif|right|thumb|330px|Destruction of the Roman army (red), courtesy of The Department of History, United States Military Academy]]{{Main article|Battle of Cannae}}\nIn the spring of 216&nbsp;BC, Hannibal took the initiative and seized the large supply depot at Cannae in the Apulian plain. By capturing Cannae, Hannibal had placed himself between the Romans and their crucial sources of supply.<ref name=\"polybius\">{{cite web| url = http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/polybius-cannae.html | title = Internet Ancient History Sourcebook}}</ref> Once the Roman Senate resumed their consular elections in 216&nbsp;BC, they appointed [[Gaius Terentius Varro]] and [[Lucius Aemilius Paullus (consul 219 BC)|Lucius Aemilius Paullus]] as [[Roman consul|consuls]]. In the meantime, the Romans hoped to gain success through sheer strength and weight of numbers, and they raised a new army of unprecedented size, estimated by some to be as large as 100,000 men, but more likely around 50\u201380,000.<ref name=\"cottrell\">Cottrell, Leonard, ''Enemy of Rome'', Evans Bros, 1965, {{ISBN|0-237-44320-1}}</ref>\n\nThe Romans and allied legions resolved to confront Hannibal and marched southward to [[Apulia]]. They eventually found him on the left bank of the Aufidus River, and encamped {{convert|6|mi|km|spell=in}} away. On this occasion, the two armies were combined into one, the consuls having to alternate their command on a daily basis. Varro was in command on the first day, a man of reckless and hubristic nature (according to Livy) and determined to defeat Hannibal.<ref name=\"cottrell\"/> Hannibal capitalized on the eagerness of Varro and drew him into a trap by using an [[Pincer movement|envelopment tactic]]. This eliminated the Roman numerical advantage by shrinking the combat area. Hannibal drew up his least reliable infantry in a semicircle in the center with the wings composed of the Gallic and Numidian horse.<ref name=\"cottrell\"/> The Roman legions forced their way through Hannibal's weak center, but the Libyan mercenaries on the wings, swung around by the movement, menaced their flanks. The onslaught of Hannibal's cavalry was irresistible. Hannibal's chief cavalry commander [[Maharbal]] led the mobile [[Numidian cavalry]] on the right, and they shattered the Roman cavalry opposing them. Hannibal's Iberian and Gallic heavy cavalry, led by Hanno on the left, defeated the Roman heavy cavalry, and then both the Carthaginian heavy cavalry and the Numidians attacked the legions from behind. As a result, the Roman army was hemmed in with no means of escape.\n\nDue to these brilliant tactics, Hannibal managed to surround and destroy all but a small remnant of his enemy, despite his own inferior numbers. Depending upon the source, it is estimated that 50,000\u201370,000 Romans were killed or captured.<ref name=\"dodge\" /> Among the dead were Roman Consul [[Lucius Aemilius Paullus (consul 219 BC)|Lucius Aemilius Paullus]], as well as two consuls for the preceding year, two [[quaestor]]s, twenty-nine out of the forty-eight [[military tribune]]s, and an additional eighty senators (at a time when the Roman Senate was composed of no more than 300 men, this constituted 25%\u201330% of the governing body). This makes the battle one of the most catastrophic defeats in the history of [[Ancient Rome]], and one of the bloodiest battles in all of human history (in terms of the number of lives lost within a single day).<ref name=\"cottrell\"/>\n\nAfter Cannae, the Romans were very hesitant to confront Hannibal in pitched battle, preferring instead to weaken him by attrition, relying on their advantages of interior lines, supply, and manpower. As a result, Hannibal fought no more major battles in Italy for the rest of the war. It is believed that his refusal to bring the war to Rome itself was due to a lack of commitment from Carthage of men, money, and material&nbsp;\u2014 principally siege equipment. Whatever the reason, the choice prompted Maharbal to say, \"Hannibal, you know how to gain a victory, but not how to use one.\"<ref>Prevas, John, ''Hannibal Crosses the Alps'', p.

[[Evelyn S. Shuckburgh]] (London: Macmillan, 1889), I. 264\u2013275.</ref> During that same year, the Greek cities in Sicily were induced to revolt against Roman political control, while Macedonian King [[Philip V of Macedon|Philip V]] [[Macedonian\u2013Carthaginian Treaty|pledged his support]] to Hannibal&nbsp;\u2013 thus initiating the [[First Macedonian War]] against Rome. Hannibal also secured an alliance with newly appointed [[tyrant]] [[Hieronymus of Syracuse]]. It is often argued that, if Hannibal had received proper material reinforcements from Carthage, he might have succeeded with a direct attack upon Rome. Instead, he had to content himself with subduing the fortresses that still held out against him, and the only other notable event of 216&nbsp;BC was the defection of certain Italian territories, including [[Capua]], the second largest city of Italy, which Hannibal made his new base. However, only a few of the Italian city-states defected to him that he had expected to gain as allies.\n\n===Stalemate===\nThe war in Italy settled into a strategic stalemate. The Romans used the [[Attrition warfare|attritional]] strategy that Fabius had taught them, and which, they finally realized, was the only feasible means of defeating Hannibal.<ref>Prevas, John, ''Hannibal Crosses the Alps: The Invasion of Italy and the Second Punic War'', p.

His immediate objectives were reduced to minor operations centered mainly round the cities of [[Campania]].\n\nThe forces detached to his lieutenants were generally unable to hold their own, and neither his home government nor his new ally Philip V of Macedon helped to make up his losses. His position in southern Italy, therefore, became increasingly difficult and his chance of ultimately conquering Rome grew ever more remote. Hannibal still won a number of notable victories: completely destroying two Roman armies in 212&nbsp;BC, and killing two consuls (including the famed [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus]]) in a battle in 208&nbsp;BC. However, Hannibal slowly began losing ground\u2014inadequately supported by his Italian allies, abandoned by his government (either because of jealousy or simply because Carthage was overstretched), and unable to match Rome's resources. He was never able to bring about another grand decisive victory that could produce a lasting strategic change.\n\nCarthaginian political will was embodied in the ruling oligarchy. There was a Carthaginian Senate, but the real power was with the inner \"[[Council of 30 Nobles]]\" and the board of judges from ruling families known as the \"[[Hundred and Four]]\". These two bodies came from the wealthy, commercial families of Carthage. Two political factions operated in Carthage: the war party, also known as the \"[[Barcid]]s\" (Hannibal's family name); and the peace party led by [[Hanno the Great#Hanno II the Great|Hanno II the Great]]. Hanno had been instrumental in denying Hannibal's requested reinforcements following the battle at Cannae.\n\nHannibal started the war without the full backing of Carthaginian oligarchy. His attack of Saguntum had presented the oligarchy with a choice of war with Rome or loss of prestige in Iberia. The oligarchy, not Hannibal, controlled the strategic resources of Carthage. Hannibal constantly sought reinforcements from either Iberia or North Africa. Hannibal's troops who were lost in combat were replaced with less well-trained and motivated mercenaries from Italy or Gaul. The commercial interests of the Carthaginian oligarchy dictated the reinforcement and supply of Iberia rather than Hannibal throughout the campaign.\n\n===Hannibal's retreat in Italy===\n[[File:Escipi\u00f3n africano.JPG|thumb|upright|Bust of [[Scipio Africanus]] from the [[Villa of the Papyri]]]]\nIn March 212&nbsp;BC, Hannibal [[Battle of Tarentum (212 BC)|captured]] [[Taranto|Tarentum]] in a surprise attack but he failed to obtain control of its harbour. The tide was slowly turning against him, and in favor of Rome.\n\nThe Roman consuls mounted a [[Battle of Capua|siege of Capua]] in 212 BC. Hannibal attacked them, forcing their withdrawal from Campania. He moved to Lucania and destroyed a 16,000-man Roman army at the [[Battle of the Silarus]], with 15,000 Romans killed. Another opportunity presented itself soon after, a Roman army of 18,000 men being destroyed by Hannibal at the [[Battle of Herdonia (212 BC)|first battle of Herdonia]] with 16,000 Roman dead, freeing Apulia from the Romans for the year. The Roman consuls mounted another [[Battle of Capua (211 BC)|siege of Capua]] in 211&nbsp;BC, conquering the city. Hannibal attempted to lift the siege with an assault on the Roman siege lines but failed. He marched on Rome to force the recall of the Roman armies. He drew off 15,000 Roman soldiers, but the siege continued and Capua fell. In 212 BC, Marcellus [[Siege of Syracuse (213\u2013212 BC)|conquered]] Syracuse and the Romans destroyed the Carthaginian army in Sicily in 211\u2013210 BC. In 210 BC, the Romans entered into an alliance with the [[Aetolian League]] to counter [[Philip V of Macedon]]. Philip, who attempted to exploit Rome's preoccupation in Italy to conquer [[Illyria]], now found himself under attack from several sides at once and was quickly subdued by Rome and her Greek allies.\n\nIn 210&nbsp;BC, Hannibal again proved his superiority in tactics by inflicting a severe defeat at the [[Battle of Herdonia (210 BC)|Battle of Herdonia]] (modern [[Ordona]]) in Apulia upon a [[proconsul]]ar army and, in 208&nbsp;BC, destroyed a Roman force engaged in the siege of [[Locri]] at the [[Battle of Petelia]]. But with the loss of Tarentum in 209&nbsp;BC and the gradual reconquest by the Romans of [[Samnium]] and [[Lucania]], his hold on south Italy was almost lost. In 207&nbsp;BC, he succeeded in making his way again into Apulia, where he waited to concert measures for a combined march upon Rome with his brother [[Hasdrubal Barca]]. On hearing, however, of his brother's defeat and death at the [[battle of the Metaurus]], he retired to [[Calabria]], where he maintained himself for the ensuing years. His brother's head had been cut off, carried across Italy, and tossed over the palisade of Hannibal's camp as a cold message of the iron-clad will of the Roman Republic. The combination of these events marked the end to Hannibal's success in Italy. With the failure of his brother Mago in [[Liguria]] (205\u2013203&nbsp;BC) and of his own negotiations with Phillip V, the last hope of recovering his ascendancy in Italy was lost. In 203&nbsp;BC, after nearly fifteen years of fighting in Italy, and with the military fortunes of Carthage rapidly declining, Hannibal was recalled to Carthage to direct the defense of his native country against a Roman invasion under Scipio Africanus.\n\n{{anchor|Conclusion of the Second Punic War}}\n\n==Conclusion of the Second Punic War (203\u2013201 BC)==\n{{anchor|Return}}\n\n===Return to Carthage===\n[[File:Campagna africana di Scipione 202 aC.png|thumb|left|upright=2.0|Final act of the Second Punic War with the [[battle of Zama]] (202 BC)]]\n\nIn 203&nbsp;BC, Hannibal was recalled from Italy by the war party in Carthage. After leaving a record of his expedition engraved in [[Punic language|Punic]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] upon bronze tablets in the temple of [[Juno Lacinia]] at [[Crotone|Crotona]], he sailed back to Africa.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/12582/12582-h/12582-h.htm#b46 |title=28.46 |publisher=Gutenberg.org |date=11 June 2004 |accessdate=6 June 2013}}</ref> His arrival immediately restored the predominance of the war party, which placed him in command of a combined force of [[Africa]]n [[conscription|levies]] and his mercenaries from Italy. In 202&nbsp;BC, Hannibal met Scipio in a fruitless peace conference. Despite mutual admiration, negotiations floundered due to Roman allegations of \"Punic Faith,\" referring to the breach of protocols that ended the First Punic War by the Carthaginian attack on Saguntum, and a Carthaginan attack on a stranded Roman fleet. Scipio and Carthage had worked out a peace plan, which was approved by Rome. The terms of the treaty were quite modest, but the war had been long for the Romans. Carthage could keep its African territory but would lose its overseas empire. Masinissa ([[Numidia]]) was to be independent. Also, Carthage was to reduce its fleet and pay a war indemnity. But Carthage then made a terrible blunder. Its long-suffering citizens had captured a stranded Roman fleet in the [[Gulf of Tunis]] and stripped it of supplies, an action that aggravated the faltering negotiations. Meanwhile, Hannibal, recalled from Italy by the Carthaginian Senate, had returned with his army. Fortified by both Hannibal and the supplies, the Carthaginians rebuffed the treaty and Roman protests. The decisive [[battle of Zama]] soon followed; the defeat removed Hannibal's air of invincibility.\n\n===Battle of Zama (202 BC)===\n{{Main article|Battle of Zama}}\nUnlike most battles of the [[Second Punic War]], at Zama, the Romans were superior in cavalry and the Carthaginians had the edge in infantry. This Roman cavalry superiority was due to the betrayal of [[Masinissa]], who had earlier assisted Carthage in Iberia, but changed sides in 206&nbsp;BC with the promise of land and due to his personal conflicts with [[Syphax]], a Carthaginian ally. Although the aging Hannibal was suffering from mental exhaustion and deteriorating health after years of campaigning in Italy, the Carthaginians still had the advantage in numbers and were boosted by the presence of 80 war elephants.<!-- 80 elephants, cited to sources by main article -->\n\n[[File:Slaget ved Zama - Cornelis Cort, 1567.jpg|right|thumb|Engraving of the [[Battle of Zama]] by [[Cornelis Cort]], 1567.

Some historians say that the elephants routed the Carthaginian cavalry and not the Romans, whilst others suggest that it was actually a tactical retreat planned by Hannibal.<ref>Scullard, H.H.

At one point, it seemed that Hannibal was on the verge of victory, but Scipio was able to rally his men, and his cavalry, having routed the Carthaginian cavalry, attacked Hannibal's rear. This two-pronged attack caused the Carthaginian formation to collapse.\n\nWith their foremost general defeated, the Carthaginians had no choice but to surrender. Carthage lost approximately 20,000 troops with an additional 15,000 wounded. In contrast, the Romans suffered only 2,500 casualties. The last major battle of the Second Punic War resulted in a loss of respect for Hannibal by his fellow Carthaginians.

They considered him the greatest enemy Rome had ever faced. [[Livy]] gives us the idea that Hannibal was extremely cruel. Even [[Cicero]], when he talked of Rome and its two great enemies, spoke of the \"honourable\" [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]] and the \"cruel\" Hannibal. Yet a different picture sometimes emerges. When Hannibal's successes had brought about the death of two [[Roman consul]]s, he vainly searched for the body of [[Gaius Flaminius]] on the shores of [[Lake Trasimeno|Lake Trasimene]], held ceremonial rituals in recognition of [[Lucius Aemilius Paullus (General)|Lucius Aemilius Paullus]], and sent [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus|Marcellus]]' ashes back to his family in Rome. Any bias attributed to [[Polybius]], however, is more troublesome. [[Ronald J. Mellor|Ronald Mellor]] considered the Greek scholar a loyal partisan of [[Scipio Aemilianus]],<ref>[[Ronald J. Mellor|Mellor, Ronald J.]] ''The Historians of Ancient Rome''</ref> while H. Ormerod does not view him as an 'altogether unprejudiced witness' when it came to his pet peeves, the Aetolians, the Carthaginians, and the Cretans.<ref>Omerod, H. ''Piracy in the Ancient World'', p.141</ref> Nonetheless, Polybius did recognize that the reputation for cruelty the Romans attached to Hannibal Barca might in reality have been due to mistaking him for one of his officers, Hannibal Monomachus.<ref>[[Gavin de Beer|De Beer, Sir Gavin]] (1969).

M. W. Turner]] envelops Hannibal's crossing of the Alps in [[Romanticism|Romantic]] atmosphere.]]\n\nHannibal is generally regarded as one of the best military strategists and tacticians of all time, the double envelopment at Cannae an enduring legacy of tactical brilliance. According to [[Appian]], several years after the Second Punic War, Hannibal served as a political advisor in the Seleucid Kingdom and [[Scipio Africanus|Scipio]] was sent there on a diplomatic mission from Rome.\n{{quote|It is said that at one of their meetings in the gymnasium Scipio and Hannibal had a conversation on the subject of generalship, in the presence of a number of bystanders, and that Scipio asked Hannibal whom he considered the greatest general, to which the latter replied, \"[[Alexander the Great|Alexander of Macedonia]]\".\n\nTo this Scipio assented since he also yielded the first place to Alexander. Then he asked Hannibal whom he placed next, and he replied, \"[[Pyrrhus of Epirus]]\", because he considered boldness the first qualification of a general; \"for it would not be possible\", he said, \"to find two kings more enterprising than these\".\n\nScipio was rather nettled by this, but nevertheless he asked Hannibal to whom he would give the third place, expecting that at least the third would be assigned to him; but Hannibal replied, \"to myself; for when I was a young man I conquered Hispania and crossed the Alps with an army, the first after [[Hercules]].\"\n\nAs Scipio saw that he was likely to prolong his self-laudation he said, laughing, \"where would you place yourself, Hannibal, if you had not been defeated by me?\" Hannibal, now perceiving his jealousy, replied, \"in that case I should have put myself before Alexander\". Thus Hannibal continued his self-laudation, but flattered Scipio in an indirect manner by suggesting that he had conquered one who was the superior of Alexander.\n\nAt the end of this conversation Hannibal invited Scipio to be his guest, and Scipio replied that he would be so gladly if Hannibal were not living with [[Antiochus III the Great|Antiochus]], who was held in suspicion by the Romans. Thus did they, in a manner worthy of great commanders, cast aside their enmity at the end of their wars.<ref name=\"appian\">Appian, ''History of the Syrian Wars'', \u00a710 and \u00a711 at [http://www.livius.org/ap-ark/appian/appian_syriaca_02.html Livius.org]</ref>}}Military academies all over the world continue to study Hannibal's exploits, especially his victory at [[Battle of Cannae|Cannae]].{{cn|date=April 2018}}\n\n[[File:Hannibal in Italy by Jacopo Ripanda - Sala di Annibale - Palazzo dei Conservatori - Musei Capitolini - Rome 2016 (2).jpg|thumb|right|Hannibal's celebrated feat in crossing the Alps with [[war elephant]]s passed into European legend: detail of a fresco by [[Jacopo Ripanda]], ca. 1510, [[Capitoline Museums]], [[Rome]].]]\n\nMaximilian Otto Bismarck Caspari, in his article in the [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition]], praises Hannibal in these words:\n{{quotation|As to the transcendent military genius of Hannibal there cannot be two opinions. The man who for fifteen years could hold his ground in a hostile country against several powerful armies and a succession of able generals must have been a commander and a [[:wikt:tactician|tactician]] of supreme capacity. In the use of strategies and [[ambush|ambuscades]] he certainly surpassed all other generals of antiquity. Wonderful as his achievements were, we must marvel the more when we take into account the grudging support he received from Carthage. As his veterans melted away, he had to organize fresh levies on the spot. We never hear of a mutiny in his army, composed though it was of North Africans, Iberians and [[Gauls]]. Again, all we know of him comes for the most part from hostile sources. The Romans feared and hated him so much that they could not do him justice. Livy speaks of his great qualities, but he adds that his vices were equally great, among which he singles out his more than Punic perfidy and an inhuman cruelty. For the first there would seem to be no further justification than that he was consummately skillful in the use of ambuscades. For the latter there is, we believe, no more ground than that at certain crises he acted in the general spirit of ancient warfare. Sometimes he contrasts most favorably with his enemy. No such brutality stains his name as that perpetrated by [[Gaius Claudius Nero|Claudius Nero]] on the vanquished [[Hasdrubal Barca]]. Polybius merely says that he was accused of cruelty by the Romans and of avarice by the Carthaginians. He had indeed bitter enemies, and his life was one continuous struggle against destiny.

No battle in history is a finer sample of tactics than Cannae. But he was yet greater in logistics and strategy. No captain ever marched to and fro among so many armies of troops superior to his own numbers and material as fearlessly and skillfully as he. No man ever held his own so long or so ably against such odds. Constantly overmatched by better soldiers, led by generals always respectable, often of great ability, he yet defied all their efforts to drive him from Italy, for half a generation. Excepting in the case of Alexander, and some few isolated instances, all wars up to the Second Punic War, had been decided largely, if not entirely, by battle-tactics. Strategic ability had been comprehended only on a minor scale. Armies had marched towards each other, had fought in parallel order, and the conqueror had imposed terms on his opponent. Any variation from this rule consisted in ambuscades or other stratagems. That war could be waged by avoiding in lieu of seeking battle; that the results of a victory could be earned by attacks upon the enemy's communications, by flank-maneuvers, by seizing positions from which safely to threaten him in case he moved, and by other devices of strategy, was not understood... [However] For the first time in the history of war, we see two contending generals avoiding each other, occupying impregnable camps on heights, marching about each other's flanks to seize cities or supplies in their rear, harassing each other with small-war, and rarely venturing on a battle which might prove a fatal disaster\u2014all with a well-conceived purpose of placing his opponent at a strategic disadvantage...

He was voted the [[SABC3's Great South Africans|11th greatest South African]] in 2004 despite having been banned from cricket for life due to his role in a match-fixing scandal. He died in a plane crash in 2002.\n\n==Early life==\nCronje was born in [[Bloemfontein]], South Africa to Ewie Cronje and San-Marie Cronje on 25 September 1969. He graduated in 1987 from Grey College in Bloemfontein, where he was the head boy. An excellent all round sportsman, he represented the then [[Orange Free State Province]] in [[cricket]] and [[Rugby union|rugby]] at schools level. He was the [[captain (sports)|captain]] of his school's cricket and rugby teams. Cronje earned a Bachelor of Commerce degree from the [[University of the Free State]]. He had an older brother, Frans Cronje, and a younger sister, Hester Parsons.\n\nHis father Ewie had played for [[Orange Free State cricket team|Orange Free State]] in the 1960s, and Frans had also played [[first-class cricket]].\n\n==First-class career==\n\nCronje made his first-class debut for Orange Free State against [[Transvaal cricket team|Transvaal]] at [[Johannesburg]] in January 1988 at the age of 18. In the following season, he was a regular, appearing in all eight [[SuperSport Series|Currie Cup]] matches plus being part of the Benson and Hedges Series winning team, scoring 73 as an opener in the final. In 1989\u201390, despite playing all the Currie Cup matches, he failed to make a century, and averaged only 19.76; however, in one-day games he averaged 60.12. During that season he scored his maiden century for [[South African Universities cricket team|South African Universities]] against [[Mike Gatting]]'s [[South African rebel tours#England Rebel Tour 1990|rebel]]s.<ref>{{cite web|title=South African Universities v England XI, England XI in South Africa 1989/90|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/52/52369.html|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=21 October 2010}}</ref>\n\nDespite having just turned 21, Cronje was made captain of Orange Free State for the 1990\u201391 season. He scored his maiden century for them against [[Natal cricket team|Natal]] in December 1990, and finished the season with another century and a total of 715 runs at 39.72. That season he also scored 159* in a 40-over match against [[Griqualand West cricket team|Griqualand West]].\n\nIn 1992\u201393, he captained Orange Free State to the Castle Cup/Total Power Series double.\n\nIn 1995, Cronje appeared for [[Leicestershire County Cricket Club|Leicestershire]] where he scored 1301 runs at 52.04 finishing the season as the county's leading scorer.\n\nIn 1995\u201396, he finished the season top of the batting averages in the Currie Cup,<ref>{{cite web|title=Batting and Fielding in Castle Cup 1995/96 (Ordered by Average)|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/RSA/Castle_Cup_1995-96/Batting_by_Average.html|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=21 October 2010}}</ref> his top score of 158 helped Free State chase down 389 to beat Northern Transvaal.<ref>{{cite web|title=Free State v Northern Transvaal, Castle Cup 1995/96|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/61/61280.html|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=21 October 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 1997, Cronje played for [[Ireland national cricket team|Ireland]] as an overseas player in the [[Benson and Hedges Cup]] and helped them to a 46-run win over [[Middlesex County Cricket Club|Middlesex]] by scoring 94 not out and taking three wickets.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ireland v Middlesex, Benson and Hedges Cup 1997 (Group D)|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/61/61280.html|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=21 October 2010}}</ref> This was Ireland's first ever win against English county opposition.<ref>{{cite web|last=James|first=Daniel|title=Irish 'weekend amateurs' enjoy historic success|url=http://static.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1997/ENG_LOCAL/B+H/R01/IRELAND_MIDDX_B+H_28-29APR1997_MR|publisher=Cricinfo|accessdate=21 October 2010|date=30 April 1997}}</ref> Later in the same competition, he scored 85 and took one wicket against [[Glamorgan County Cricket Club|Glamorgan]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Glamorgan v Ireland, Benson and Hedges Cup 1997 (Group D)|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/63/63891.html|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=21 October 2010}}</ref>\n\n==International career==\n\n===Debuts===\nCronje's form in 1991/92 was impressive especially in the one-day format where he averaged 61.40. He earned an international call up for the [[1992 Cricket World Cup|1992 World Cup]], making his [[One Day International]] debut against [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]] at [[Sydney]]. During the tournament he played in eight of the team's nine games, averaging 34.00 with the bat, while his medium pace was used in bowling 20 overs.\n\nAfter the World Cup Cronje was part of the tour to the West Indies; he featured in the three ODI's, and in the Test match at [[Bridgetown]] that followed, he made his [[Test cricket|Test]] debut. This was South Africa's first Test since readmission and they came close to beating a strong [[West Indies national cricket team|West Indian]] side, going into the final day at 122/2 chasing 200 they collapsed to 148.\n\n[[India national cricket team|India]] toured South Africa in 1992/93. In the first one-day international, he hit the famous six when his team needed 6 runs off only 4 balls, and was awarded Man of the match for his bowling. In the one-day series, Cronje managed just one fifty but with the ball he was economical and took his career best figures of 5/32, becoming the second South African to take five wickets in an ODI.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rosendorff|first=Peter|title=South Africa vs India 1st ODI Match Report|url=http://static.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1992-93/IND_IN_RSA/IND_RSA_ODI1_07DEC1992_MR|publisher=Cricinfo|accessdate=21 October 2010|date=3 November 1993}}</ref> In the Test series that followed he scored his maiden test century, 135 off 411 balls, after coming in at 0\u20131 in the second over he was last man out, after eight and three-quarter hours, in a total of 275. This contributed to South Africa's first Test win since readmission. At the end of the season in a triangular tournament with [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan]] and West Indies he scored 81 off 70 balls against Pakistan.\n\nIn South Africa's next Test series against [[Sri Lanka national cricket team|Sri Lanka]], Cronje scored his second Test century, 122 in the second Test in [[Colombo]]; the victory margin of an innings and 208 runs is a South African record. He finished the series with 237 runs at 59.25 after scoring 73* in the drawn third Test.\n\n===Stand-in captain===\n\nIn 1993\u201394, there was another Castle Cup/Total Power Series double for Orange Free State. In international cricket, he was named as vice-captain for the tour of Australia despite being the youngest member of the squad. In the first ODI of the triangular tournament with [[New Zealand national cricket team|New Zealand]] and [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]], he guided South Africa to victory against Australia at the MCG with 91*, which won him the man of the match award. He scored 71 in a rain-affected first test at [[Melbourne]] before a tense second test that South Africa won by 5 runs. An injury to captain [[Kepler Wessels]] meant Cronje was captain for the final day of the match. Between the second and third tests, the one-day tournament continued, now with Cronje as captain, South Africa made the final series but lost it 2\u20131 to Australia. He became South Africa's second youngest Test captain, after [[Murray Bisset]] in 1898\u201399, when he led the team for the third test at [[Adelaide]] but it was an unsuccessful start to his captaincy career as the series was squared.\n\nIn February 1994, there was the return series as Australia toured South Africa. Cronje started the ODI series with scores of 112, 97, 45 and 50* and when Australia played Orange Free State in their final match before the first Test, Cronje hit 251 off 306 balls, 200 of these came on the final day in which 294 runs were added. Despite this, Orange Free State lost the match. In the first test at Johannesburg, he added another century as South Africa won by 197 runs. This innings was the end of a 14-day period in which he'd scored 721 runs against the Aussies. However, he failed to reach fifty in the next two tests and four ODIs as both series were drawn.\n\nThere was another drawn series when South Africa toured England in 1994. Cronje scored only one century on the whole tour and scored only 90 runs in the three-test series. In October 1994, South Africa again came up against Australia in a triangular one day series also featuring [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan]]. Cronje scored 354 runs at an average of 88.50. Despite this, South Africa lost all their matches.<ref>{{cite web|title=Batting and Fielding for South Africa, Wills Triangular Series 1994/95|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/PAK/Wills_Triangular_Series_1994-95/South_Africa_Batting.html|publisher=CricketArchive|accessdate=21 October 2010}}</ref> This series was [[Bob Woolmer]]'s first as coach and Kepler Wessels' last as captain. Cronje, who'd previously been vice-captain, was named as captain for the test series with New Zealand in 1994\u201395.\n\n===Permanent captain===\n\nSouth Africa lost the first Test in Johannesburg but before the second test the two teams plus Pakistan and Sri Lanka competed for the [[Mandela Trophy]], New Zealand failed to gain a win in the six match round robin stage while South Africa beat Pakistan in the final. This changed the momentum as South Africa secured wins in [[Durban]] and [[Cape Town]], where Cronje scored his fourth test century, he was the first captain since [[W. G. Grace]] to win a three-match rubber after being one down.\n\nIn early 1995, South Africa won one-off tests against both Pakistan and New Zealand, in [[Auckland]] Cronje scored the only century of the match before a final day declaration left his bowlers barely enough time to dismiss the Kiwis.\n\nIn October 1995, South Africa won a one-off Test with [[Zimbabwe national cricket team|Zimbabwe]]. Cronje scored a second innings 54* to guide them to a seven wicket win. In two one-dayers that followed, he took five wickets as South Africa comfortably won both. South Africa won the five Test series against England 1\u20130 despite Cronje struggling, scoring 113 runs at 18.83. However, he top scored in the one-day series that they won 6\u20131.\n\nIn the [[1996 Cricket World Cup|1996 World Cup]], he scored 78 and 45* against New Zealand and Pakistan respectively as South Africa won their group but in the Quarter final with West Indies a [[Brian Lara]] century ended their ten-game winning streak.\n\nThe 1996\u201397 season featured back-to-back series with India. The first away was lost 2\u20131. The home series was won 2\u20130. In the six tests combined, Cronje managed one fifty. Cronje produced better form against Australia, averaging over 50 in both test and ODI series although both were lost.\n\nCronje started 1997\u201398 by leading South Africa to their first series victory in Pakistan, his batting continued to struggle with his biggest contribution being taking the wickets of [[Inzamam-ul-Haq]] and [[Moin Khan]] in the Third Test.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pakistan v South Africa, 1997/98, Third Test, Scorecard|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63768.html|publisher=Cricinfo|accessdate=21 October 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Better form===\nCronje once again came up against Australia and once again ended on the losing side. In the triangular one day series they won the group with Australia just scraping through, they also won the first 'final' but South Africa lost the last two finals. During the group matches Cronje had threatened to lead his team off after [[Pat Symcox]] had missiles thrown at him, Symcox had the last laugh ending the match with 4/24. Before the Test series started he scored consecutive centuries against [[Tasmania cricket team|Tasmania]] and [[Australia A cricket team|Australia A]] these were his first in two years.\n\nIn the first Test, Cronje scored 70 as South Africa saved the match; in the second Test, he lasted 335 minutes for his 88. Despite this, they lost by an innings. In the third Test, they scored 517 and although [[Mark Taylor (cricketer)|Mark Taylor]] carried his bat for 169, Australia needed to bat 109 overs to save the match. [[Mark Waugh]] batted 404 minutes, and, despite controversy when Waugh hit one of his bails off (under Law 35 he was adjudged to have finished his stroke and therefore given not out), South Africa fell three wickets short. Cronje put a stump through the umpires' dressing room door after the match and was lucky to avoid a ban.<ref>{{cite web|title=Australia v South Africa, Third Test Report|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/153368.html|work=Wisden Cricketers' Almanack \u2013 online archive|publisher=John Wisden & Co.|accessdate=20 October 2010|year=1999}}</ref>\n\nCronje missed the first Test of the series with Pakistan because of a knee injury. The second Test at Durban was lost, but he top scored at [[Port Elizabeth]] with 85, to help square the three Test series 1\u20131. There was still time in the season for a two-Test series with Sri Lanka. The first was won with Cronje scoring 49 and 74; in the second Test, he took 3/14, his best bowling in Tests, and smashed 82 off 63 balls, his fifty being brought up with three consecutive sixes off [[Muttiah Muralitharan]], and was reached off just 31 balls; at the time, it was the second fastest in Tests after [[Kapil Dev]]'s.<ref>{{cite web|title=South Africa v Sri Lanka, 1997/98, Second Test, Scorecard|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63800.html|publisher=Cricinfo|accessdate=21 October 2010}}</ref> In the triangular series, which South Africa won, he scored only one fifty at [[East London, South Africa|East London]] where he also took 2/17 off 10 overs.<ref>{{cite web|title=South Africa v Pakistan, 1997/98, Fifth Match, Scorecard|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/66083.html|publisher=Cricinfo|accessdate=21 October 2010}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1998 Test series against England, Cronje scored five consecutive fifties, having failed to score one in the nine previous Tests against them.

On the final morning as they batted on, news filtered through that the captains had met and were going to \"make a game of it\". A target of 250 from 70 overs was agreed. When South Africa reached 248/8, Cronje declared; both teams then forfeited an innings leaving England a target of 249 to win the Test, which they did with two wickets left and only five balls remaining. It ended South Africa's 14 game unbeaten streak in Test cricket. It was later learnt Cronje accepted money and a gift from a bookmaker in return for making an early declaration in this Test.

After an enquiry by the [[King Commission]], Cronje was banned from any involvement in cricket for life.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cronje banned for life|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/93082.html|publisher=Cricinfo|accessdate=21 October 2010|date=11 October 2000}}</ref> He challenged his life ban in September 2001 but on 17 October 2001, his application was dismissed.<ref>{{cite web|last=Robinson|first=Peter|title=Cronje remains an outcast|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/109086.html|publisher=Cricinfo|accessdate=21 October 2010|date=17 October 2001}}</ref>\n\nAfter 13 years, on 22 July 2013, the Indian Police registered a [[First Information Report]] for match-fixing in 2000; the charge sheet in the case involving a few South African cricketers including its former captain Hansie Cronje, was finally filed. The scandal was one of the biggest ever to have hit international cricket until the [[Pakistan cricket spot-fixing scandal]].\n\n==Death==\n\nOn 1 June 2002, Cronje's scheduled flight home from Johannesburg to [[George, Western Cape|George]] was grounded. He then hitched a ride as the only passenger aboard a [[Hawker Siddeley HS 748]] [[turboprop]] aircraft. Near George airport, the pilots lost visibility in clouds and were unable to land, partly due to unusable navigational equipment. While circling, the plane crashed into the [[Outeniqua Mountains]] northeast of the airport. Cronje, aged 32, and the two pilots were killed instantly.\n\nIn August 2006, an inquest into the plane crash was opened by South Africa's High Court.<ref>{{cite news|title=Cronje inquest opens|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/cricket/cronje-inquest-opens/2006/08/08/1154802862135.html|publisher=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=3 March 2010|date=8 August 2006}}</ref> The inquest concluded that \"the death of the deceased Wessel Johannes Cronje was brought about by an act or omission [[prima facie]] amounting to an offence on the part of pilots.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Pilot error caused Cronje crash|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4790609.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=3 March 2010|date=14 August 2006}}</ref>\n\nTheories that Cronje was murdered on the orders of a cricket betting syndicate flourished after his death and were most recently re-floated by former [[Nottinghamshire]] coach [[Clive Rice]] in the wake of the death of Pakistan coach [[Bob Woolmer]] in March 2007.

(''Hultsfreds kommun'') is a [[Municipalities of Sweden|municipality]] in [[Kalmar County]], in south-eastern [[Sweden]]. The seat is in the town of [[Hultsfred]].\n\nThe present municipality was created in 1971 through the amalgamation of the market town (''[[k\u00f6ping]]'') of Hultsfred (instituted in 1927) with a number of surrounding municipalities. In 1863 there were eight entities in the area.\n\nHultsfred is known as the site of a major [[Rock and roll|rock]] festival in Sweden, the [[Hultsfred Festival]].\n\n==Geography==\nBasically every one of the localities of Hultsfred Municipality are situated on the railway. Besides Hultsfred, in the mid north of the municipality, there are the towns of [[Virserum]] in the south-west and other ever smaller settlements such as [[L\u00f6nneberga]], [[Silverdalen]] and [[M\u00e5lilla]]. The population of the municipality has however been decreasing with some 2,000 people in the last 10 years, as many people move to larger [[cities of Sweden|cities]], causing a decrease in nativity.\n\nMuch of the geography is taken up with forests, a notability for the entire province of [[Sm\u00e5land]], with some few scattered areas suitable for agriculture.\n\n==History==\nIn the age known as the [[Nordic Bronze Age]], the area had some shipping of furs to northern Germany and the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] army, but not much is known from that time other than the area being inhabited; there has also been older finds from 3000-4000 BC. However, from the medieval age, around 1100 AD, there still remains a few churches.\n\nThe area continued to be inhabited mainly by farmers until the 20th century. In the 17th and 18th there was some production of iron in Kalmar County, totalling about 10 mines; of those 2 were located to the municipality of Hultsfred. Hultsfred was a center for some military exercising companies during the 19th century, and some remaining building can be visited in the vicinity of Silver\u00e5n. When the railroads through Sweden were built late in that century, Hultsfred received a population boost.\n\nThere are several folks museums around the area that keeps trace of its history.\n\n==Localities==\nThere are eight [[Urban areas in Sweden|urban area]]s (also called a T\u00e4tort or locality) in Hultsfred Municipality.\n\nIn the table the localities are listed according to the size of the population as of December 31, 2005. The municipal seat is in bold characters.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! # !! Locality !!

The principle of ministerial responsibility to the lower House did not develop until the 19th century\u2014the House of Lords was superior to the House of Commons both in theory and in practice. Members of the House of Commons (MPs) were elected in an antiquated [[electoral system]], under which [[constituency|constituencies]] of vastly different sizes existed. Thus, the borough of [[Old Sarum]], with seven voters, could elect two members, as could the borough of [[Dunwich (UK Parliament constituency)|Dunwich]], which had almost completely disappeared into the sea due to land erosion.\n\nMany small constituencies, known as pocket or [[rotten borough]]s, were controlled by members of the House of Lords, who could ensure the election of their relatives or supporters. During the reforms of the 19th century, beginning with the [[Reform Act 1832]], the electoral system for the House of Commons was progressively regularised. No longer dependent on the Lords for their seats, MPs grew more assertive.\n\nThe supremacy of the British House of Commons was established in the early 20th century. In 1909, the Commons passed the so-called \"[[People's Budget]]\", which made numerous changes to the taxation system which were detrimental to wealthy landowners. The House of Lords, which consisted mostly of powerful landowners, rejected the Budget. On the basis of the Budget's popularity and the Lords' consequent unpopularity, the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] narrowly won two general elections in 1910.\n\nUsing the result as a mandate, the Liberal Prime Minister, [[Herbert Henry Asquith]], introduced the Parliament Bill, which sought to restrict the powers of the House of Lords. (He did not reintroduce the land tax provision of the People's Budget.) When the Lords refused to pass the bill, Asquith countered with a promise extracted from the King in secret before the second general election of 1910 and requested the creation of several hundred Liberal peers, so as to erase the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] majority in the House of Lords. In the face of such a threat, the House of Lords narrowly passed the bill.\n\nThe [[Parliament Act 1911]], as it became, prevented the Lords from blocking a [[money bill]] (a bill dealing with taxation), and allowed them to delay any other bill for a maximum of three sessions (reduced to two sessions in 1949), after which it could become law over their objections. However, regardless of the Parliament Acts of 1911 and 1949, the House of Lords has always retained the unrestricted power to veto any bill outright which attempts to extend the life of a parliament.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/how/laws/parliamentacts/ |title=The Parliament Acts |publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom|accessdate=17 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland===\nThe [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]] created the parliaments of [[Northern Ireland]] and [[Southern Ireland (1921\u201322)|Southern Ireland]] and reduced the representation of both parts at Westminster. The number of Northern Ireland seats was increased again after the introduction of [[Direct rule over Northern Ireland|direct rule]] in 1973.  The [[Irish Free State]] became independent in 1922, and in 1927 parliament was renamed the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\n\nFurther reforms to the House of Lords were made in the 20th century. The [[Life Peerages Act 1958]] authorised the regular creation of [[life peerage]] dignities. By the 1960s, the regular creation of hereditary peerage dignities had ceased; thereafter, almost all new peers were life peers only.\n\nThe [[House of Lords Act 1999]] removed the automatic right of hereditary peers to sit in the Upper House, although it made an exception for 92 of them to be elected to life-terms by the other hereditary peers, with by-elections upon their death. The House of Lords is now a chamber that is subordinate to the House of Commons. Additionally, the [[Constitutional Reform Act 2005]] led to abolition of the [[judicial functions of the House of Lords]] with the creation of the new [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] in October 2009.\n\n==Composition and powers==\nThe legislative authority, the [[Crown-in-Parliament]], has three separate elements: the Monarch, the [[House of Lords]], and the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]].  No individual may be a member of both Houses, and members of the House of Lords are legally barred from voting in elections for members of the House of Commons. Formerly, no-one could be a member of Parliament while holding an [[Office of profit]] under the Crown, thus maintaining the [[separation of powers]], but the principle has been gradually eroded. Until 1919, Members of Parliament who were appointed to ministerial office lost their right to sit in the House of Commons and had to seek re-election. The rule survives in the [[House of Commons Disqualification Act 1975]] which specifies a number of state positions that make an individual ineligible to serve as a member of Parliament. The only vestige of the principle is the process of [[Resignation from the British House of Commons|resignation from the House of Commons]].\n\n[[Royal Assent]] of the Monarch is required for all Bills to become law, and certain Delegated Legislation must be made by the Monarch by [[Order in Council]]. The Crown also has executive powers which do not depend on Parliament, through [[Royal Prerogative|prerogative powers]], including the power to make treaties, declare war, award honours, and appoint officers and civil servants. In practice these are always exercised by the monarch on the advice of the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] and the other ministers of [[HM Government]]. The Prime Minister and government are directly accountable to Parliament, through its control of public finances, and to the public, through the election of members of parliament.\n\nThe Monarch also appoints the Prime Minister, who then forms a government from members of the Houses of Parliament. This must be someone who could command a majority in a confidence vote in the House of Commons. In the past the monarch has occasionally had to make a judgment, as in the appointment of [[Alec Douglas-Home]] in 1963 when it was thought that the incumbent Prime Minister, [[Harold Macmillan]], had become ill with terminal cancer. However, today the monarch is advised by the outgoing Prime Minister as to whom he or she should offer the position next.\n\nThe Upper House is formally styled \"The Right Honourable The Lords Spiritual and Temporal in Parliament Assembled\", the Lords Spiritual being bishops of the [[Church of England]] and the Lords Temporal being [[Peerage|Peers of the Realm]]. The Lords Spiritual and Lords Temporal are considered separate \"[[Estates of the realm|estates]]\", but they sit, debate and vote together.\n\nSince the [[Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949]], the powers of the House of Lords have been very much less than those of the House of Commons. All bills except [[money bills]] are debated and voted upon in the House of Lords; however, by voting against a bill, the House of Lords can only delay it for a maximum of two parliamentary sessions over a year. After that time, the House of Commons can force the Bill through without the Lords' consent, under the Parliament Acts. The House of Lords can also hold the government to account through questions to government ministers and the operation of a small number of select committees. The highest court in England & Wales and in Northern Ireland used to be a committee of the House of Lords, but it became an independent [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|supreme court]] in 2009.\n\nThe Lords Spiritual formerly included all of the senior clergymen of the Church of England\u2014archbishops, bishops, abbots and mitred priors. Upon the Dissolution of the Monasteries under Henry VIII the abbots and mitred priors lost their positions in Parliament. All [[diocesan bishop]]s continued to sit in Parliament, but the [[Bishopric of Manchester Act 1847]], and later Acts, provide that only the 26 most senior are Lords Spiritual. These always include the incumbents of the \"five great [[episcopal see|sees]]\", namely the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], the [[Archbishop of York]], the [[Bishop of London]], the [[Bishop of Durham]] and the [[Bishop of Winchester]]. The remaining 21 Lords Spiritual are the most senior diocesan bishops, ranked in order of [[consecration]], although the [[Lords Spiritual (Women) Act 2015]] makes time-limited provision for vacancies to be filled by women who are bishops.\n\nThe Lords Temporal are all members of the [[Peerage]]. Formerly, they were all hereditary peers. The right of some hereditary peers to sit in Parliament was not automatic: after Scotland and England united into Great Britain in 1707, it was provided that all peers whose dignities had been created by English kings could sit in Parliament, but those whose dignities had been created by Scottish kings were to elect a limited number of \"[[representative peers]]\". A similar arrangement was made in respect of Ireland when it was united with Great Britain in 1801, but when southern Ireland left the United Kingdom in 1922 the election of Irish representative peers ceased. By the [[Peerage Act 1963]], the election of Scottish representative peers also ended, and all Scottish peers were granted the right to sit in Parliament. Under the House of Lords Act 1999, only life peerages (that is to say, peerage dignities which cannot be inherited) automatically entitle their holders to seats in the House of Lords. Of the hereditary peers, only 92\u2014the [[Earl Marshal]], the [[Lord Great Chamberlain]] and the 90 elected by other peers\u2014retain their seats in the House.\n\nThe Commons, the last of the \"estates\" of the Kingdom, are represented in the House of Commons, which is formally styled \"The Honourable The Commons in Parliament Assembled\" (\"commons\" coming not from the term \"commoner\", but from ''{{lang|fr|commune}}'', the old French term for a district).{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} In 2016, the House consists of 650 members. Each \"Member of Parliament\" or \"MP\" is chosen by a single constituency by the [[First Past the Post electoral system|First-Past-the-Post]] electoral system. Universal adult [[suffrage]] exists for those 18 and over; citizens of the United Kingdom, and those of the [[Republic of Ireland]] and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth nations]] resident in the United Kingdom, are qualified to vote, unless they are in prison at the time of the election. The term of members of the House of Commons depends on the term of Parliament, a maximum of five years; a general election, during which all the seats are contested, occurs after each dissolution (see below).\n\nAll legislation must be passed by the House of Commons to become law and it controls taxation and the supply of money to the government. Government ministers (including the Prime Minister) must regularly answer questions in the House of Commons and there are a number of [[Select Committee (United Kingdom)|select committees]] that scrutinise particular issues and the workings of the government.  There are also mechanisms that allow members of the House of Commons to bring to the attention of the government particular issues affecting their constituents.\n\n==State Opening==\n{{Main|State Opening of Parliament}}\nThe State Opening of Parliament is an annual event that marks the commencement of a session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It is held in the [[House of Lords]] Chamber.  Before 2012, it took place in November or December,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/faqs/house-of-lords-faqs/lords-stateopening/ |title=State Opening of Parliament |date=6 October 2009 |publisher=House of Lords Information Office |accessdate=14 October 2009}}</ref> or, in a general election year, when the new Parliament first assembled. From 2012 onwards, the ceremony has taken place in May or June.\n\n[[File:John Hampden portrait.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|right|Leading 17th century Parliamentarian [[John Hampden]] is one of the [[Five Members]] annually commemorated]]\nUpon the signal of the Monarch, the [[Lord Great Chamberlain]] raises his wand of office to signal to [[Black Rod]], who is charged with summoning the House of Commons and has been waiting in the Commons lobby. Black Rod turns and, under the escort of the Door-keeper of the House of Lords and an [[Inspector#United Kingdom|inspector of police]], approaches the doors to the Chamber of the Commons. In 1642, King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] stormed into the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]] in an unsuccessful attempt to arrest the [[Five Members]], who included the celebrated English patriot and leading Parliamentarian [[John Hampden]]. This action sparked the [[English Civil War]].<ref>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Black Rod|volume=4}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first1=John Joseph |last1=Bagley |first2=A.

He is then admitted, and announces the command of the monarch for the attendance of the Commons.<ref name=\"State opening\"/>\n\nThe monarch reads a speech, known as the [[Speech from the Throne]], which is prepared by the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] and the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]], outlining the Government's agenda for the coming year. The speech reflects the legislative agenda for which the Government intends to seek the agreement of both Houses of Parliament.\n\nAfter the monarch leaves, each Chamber proceeds to the consideration of an \"Address in Reply to Her Majesty's Gracious Speech\". But, first, each House considers a bill ''[[pro forma]]'' to symbolise their right to deliberate independently of the monarch. In the House of Lords, the bill is called the [[Select Vestries Bill]], while the Commons equivalent is the [[Outlawries Bill]]. The Bills are considered for the sake of form only, and do not make any actual progress.\n\n==Procedure==\n:''See also the [[Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom#Stages of a bill|stages of a bill]] section in [[Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom]]''\nBoth houses of the British Parliament are presided over by a speaker, the [[Speaker of the British House of Commons|Speaker of the House]] for the Commons and the [[Lord Speaker]] in the House of Lords.\n\nFor the Commons, the approval of the Sovereign is theoretically required before the election of the Speaker becomes valid, but it is, by modern convention, always granted. The Speaker's place may be taken by three deputies, known as the Chairman, First Deputy Chairman and Second Deputy [[Chairman of Ways and Means]]. (They take their name from the Committee of Ways and Means, of which they were once presiding officers, but which no longer exists.)\n\nPrior to July 2006, the House of Lords was presided over by a [[Lord Chancellor]] (a Cabinet member), whose influence as Speaker was very limited (whilst the powers belonging to the Speaker of the House of Commons are vast). However, as part of the [[Constitutional Reform Act 2005]], the position of Speaker of the House of Lords (as it is termed in the Act) was separated from the office of Lord Chancellor (the office which has control over the judiciary as a whole), though the Lords remain largely self-governing.  Decisions on points of order and on the disciplining of unruly members are made by the whole body in the Upper House, but by the Speaker alone in the Lower House. Speeches in the House of Lords are addressed to the House as a whole (using the words \"My Lords\"), but those in the House of Commons are addressed to the Speaker alone (using \"Mr Speaker\" or \"Madam Speaker\").  Speeches may be made to [[List of people who have addressed both Houses of the United Kingdom Parliament|both Houses simultaneously]].\n\nBoth Houses may decide questions by [[voice vote]]; members shout out \"Aye!\" and \"No!\" in the Commons\u2014or \"Content!\" and \"Not-Content!\" in the Lords\u2014and the presiding officer declares the result. The pronouncement of either Speaker may be challenged, and a recorded vote (known as a [[division (vote)|division]]) demanded. (The Speaker of the House of Commons may choose to overrule a frivolous request for a division, but the Lord Speaker does not have that power.) In each House, a division requires members to file into one of the two lobbies alongside the Chamber; their names are recorded by clerks, and their votes are counted as they exit the lobbies to re-enter the Chamber. The Speaker of the House of Commons is expected to be non-partisan, and does not cast a vote except in the case of a tie; the Lord Speaker, however, votes along with the other Lords.\n\nBoth Houses normally conduct their business in public, and there are galleries where visitors may sit.\n\n==Term==\nAs at 2016, Parliament has a fixed term of 5 years.\n\nOriginally there was no fixed limit on the length of a Parliament, but the [[Triennial Act 1694]] set the maximum duration at three years. As the frequent elections were deemed inconvenient, the [[Septennial Act 1715]] extended the maximum to seven years, but the [[Parliament Act 1911]] reduced it to five. During the [[Second World War]], the term was temporarily extended to ten years by Acts of Parliament. Since the end of the war the maximum has remained five years. Modern Parliaments, however, rarely continued for the maximum duration; normally, they were dissolved earlier. For instance, the [[Fifty-Second Parliament of the United Kingdom|52nd]], which assembled in 1997, was dissolved after four years. The Septennial Act was repealed by the [[Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011]].\n\n'''Summary history of terms of the Parliament of the United Kingdom'''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"       \n|-       \n!

Parliament is formally summoned 40 days in advance by the Sovereign, who is the source of parliamentary authority. On the day indicated by the Sovereign's proclamation, the two Houses assemble in their respective chambers. The Commons are then summoned to the House of Lords, where [[Lords Commissioners]] (representatives of the Sovereign) instruct them to elect a Speaker. The Commons perform the election; on the next day, they return to the House of Lords, where the Lords Commissioners confirm the election and grant the new Speaker the royal approval in the Sovereign's name.\n\nThe business of Parliament for the next few days of its session involves the taking of the [[Oath of Allegiance (United Kingdom)|oaths of allegiance]]. Once a majority of the members have taken the oath in each House, the State Opening of Parliament may take place. The Lords take their seats in the House of Lords Chamber, the Commons appear at the Bar (at the entrance to the Chamber), and the Sovereign takes his or her seat on the throne. The Sovereign then reads the [[Speech from the Throne]]\u2014the content of which is determined by the Ministers of the Crown\u2014outlining the Government's legislative agenda for the upcoming year. Thereafter, each House proceeds to the transaction of legislative business.\n\nBy custom, before considering the Government's legislative agenda, a bill is introduced ''pro forma'' in each House\u2014the [[Select Vestries Bill]] in the House of Lords and the [[Outlawries Bill]] in the House of Commons. These bills do not become laws; they are ceremonial indications of the power of each House to debate independently of the Crown. After the ''pro forma'' bill is introduced, each House debates the content of the Speech from the Throne for several days. Once each House formally sends its reply to the Speech, legislative business may commence, appointing committees, electing officers, passing resolutions and considering legislation.\n\nA session of Parliament is brought to an end by a [[legislative session#Procedure in Commonwealth realms|prorogation]]. There is a ceremony similar to the State Opening, but much less well-known to the general public. Normally, the Sovereign does not personally attend the prorogation ceremony in the House of Lords; he or she is represented by Lords Commissioners. The next session of Parliament begins under the procedures described above, but it is not necessary to conduct another election of a Speaker or take the oaths of allegiance afresh at the beginning of such subsequent sessions. Instead, the State Opening of Parliament proceeds directly. To avoid the delay of opening a new session in the event of an emergency during the long summer recess, Parliament is no longer prorogued beforehand, but only after the Houses have reconvened in the autumn; the State Opening follows a few days later.\n\nEach Parliament comes to an end, after a number of sessions, in anticipation of a general election. [[Dissolution of the Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament is dissolved]] by virtue of the [[Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011]]. Prior to that, dissolution was effected by the Sovereign, always on the advice of the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister could seek dissolution at a time politically advantageous to his or her party. If the Prime Minister loses the support of the House of Commons, Parliament will dissolve and a new election will be held. Parliaments can also be dissolved if two-thirds of the House of Commons votes for an early election.\n\nFormerly, the demise of the Sovereign automatically brought a Parliament to an end, the Crown being seen as the ''{{lang|la|caput, principium, et finis}}'' (beginning, basis and end) of the body, but this is no longer the case. The first change was during the reign of William and Mary, when it was seen to be inconvenient to have no Parliament at a time when succession to the Crown could be disputed, and an Act was passed that provided that a Parliament was to continue for six months after the death of a Sovereign, unless dissolved earlier. Under the [[Representation of the People Act 1867]] Parliament can now continue for as long as it would otherwise have done in the event of the death of the Sovereign.\n\nAfter each Parliament concludes, the Crown issues writs to hold a general election and elect new members of the House of Commons, though membership of the House of Lords does not change.\n\n==Legislative functions==\n[[File:Palace of Westminster, London - Feb 2007.jpg|right|upright=1.35|thumb|Parliament meets in the [[Palace of Westminster]].]]\nLaws can be made by Acts of the United Kingdom Parliament. While Acts can apply to the whole of the United Kingdom including Scotland, due to the continuing separation of [[Scots law]] many Acts do not apply to Scotland and may be matched either by equivalent Acts that apply to Scotland alone or, since 1999, by legislation set by the [[Scottish Parliament]] relating to devolved matters.\n\nThis has led to a paradox known as the [[West Lothian question]]. The existence of a devolved Scottish Parliament means that while Westminster MPs from Scotland may vote directly on matters that affect English constituencies, they may not have much power over their laws affecting their own constituency. Since there is no devolved \"English Parliament\", the converse is not true. While any Act of the Scottish Parliament may be overturned, amended or ignored by Westminster, in practice this has yet to happen. [[Legislative Consent Motion]]s enables the UK Parliament to vote on issues normally devolved to Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland, as part of United Kingdom legislation.\n\nLaws, in draft form known as bills, may be introduced by any member of either House. A bill introduced by a Minister is known as a \"Government Bill\"; one introduced by another member is called a \"[[Private Members' Bills in the Parliament of the United Kingdom|Private Member's Bill]]\". A different way of categorising bills involves the subject. Most bills, involving the general public, are called \"[[public bill]]s\". A bill that seeks to grant special rights to an individual or small group of individuals, or a body such as a local authority, is called a \"[[Local and Personal Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom|Private Bill]]\". A Public Bill which affects private rights (in the way a Private Bill would) is called a \"[[Hybrid Bill]]\", although those that draft bills take pains to avoid this.\n\nPrivate Members' Bills make up the majority of bills, but are far less likely to be passed than government bills. There are three methods for an MP to introduce a Private Member's Bill. The Private Members' Ballot (once per Session) put names into a ballot, and those who win are given time to propose a bill. The [[Ten Minute Rule]] is another method, where MPs are granted ten minutes to outline the case for a new piece of legislation. Standing Order 57 is the third method, which allows a bill to be introduced without debate if a day's notice is given to the Table Office. [[Filibuster]]ing is a danger, as an opponent of a bill can waste much of the limited time allotted to it. Private Members' Bills have no chance of success if the current government opposes them, but they are used in moral issues: the bills to decriminalise homosexuality and abortion were Private Members' Bills, for example. Governments can sometimes attempt to use Private Members' Bills to pass things it would rather not be associated with. \"Handout bills\" are bills which a government hands to MPs who win Private Members' Ballots.\n\nEach Bill goes through several stages in each House. The first stage, called the [[first reading]], is a formality. At the [[second reading]], the general principles of the bill are debated, and the House may vote to reject the bill, by not passing the motion \"That the Bill be now read a second time\". Defeats of Government Bills in the Commons are extremely rare, the last being in 2005, and may constitute a [[motion of no confidence]]. (Defeats of Bills in the Lords never affect confidence and are much more frequent.)\n\nFollowing the second reading, the bill is sent to a committee. In the House of Lords, the [[Committee of the Whole House]] or the [[Grand Committee]] are used. Each consists of all members of the House; the latter operates under special procedures, and is used only for uncontroversial bills. In the House of Commons, the bill is usually committed to a Public Bill Committee, consisting of between 16 and 50 members, but the Committee of the Whole House is used for important legislation. Several other types of committees, including Select Committees, may be used, but rarely. A committee considers the bill clause by clause, and reports the bill as amended to the House, where further detailed consideration (\"consideration stage\" or \"report stage\") occurs. However, a practice which used to be called the \"kangaroo\" (Standing Order 32) allows the Speaker to select which amendments are debated. This device is also used under Standing Order 89 by the committee chairman, to restrict debate in committee. The Speaker, who is impartial as between the parties, by convention selects amendments for debate which represent the main divisions of opinion within the House. Other amendments can technically be proposed, but in practice have no chance of success unless the parties in the House are closely divided. If pressed they would normally be casually defeated by acclamation.\n\nOnce the House has considered the bill, the third reading follows. In the House of Commons, no further amendments may be made, and the passage of the motion \"That the Bill be now read a third time\" is passage of the whole bill. In the House of Lords further amendments to the bill may be moved. After the passage of the third reading motion, the House of Lords must vote on the motion \"That the Bill do now pass\". Following its passage in one House, the bill is sent to the other House. If passed in identical form by both Houses, it may be presented for the Sovereign's Assent. If one House passes amendments that the other will not agree to, and the two Houses cannot resolve their disagreements, the bill will normally fail.\n\nSince the passage of the Parliament Act 1911 the power of the House of Lords to reject bills passed by the House of Commons has been restricted, with further restrictions were placed by the Parliament Act 1949. If the House of Commons passes a public bill in two successive sessions, and the House of Lords rejects it both times, the Commons may direct that the bill be presented to the Sovereign for his or her Assent, disregarding the rejection of the Bill in the House of Lords. In each case, the bill must be passed by the House of Commons at least one calendar month before the end of the session. The provision does not apply to Private Bills bills or to Public bills if they originated in the House of Lords or if they seek to extend the duration of a Parliament beyond five years. A special procedure applies in relation to bills classified by the Speaker of the House of Commons as \"Money Bills\". A Money Bill concerns ''solely'' national taxation or public funds; the Speaker's certificate is deemed conclusive under all circumstances. If the House of Lords fails to pass a Money Bill within one month of its passage in the House of Commons, the Lower House may direct that the Bill be submitted for the Sovereign's Assent immediately.{{sfn|May|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nEven before the passage of the Parliament Acts, the Commons possessed pre-eminence in cases of financial matters. By ancient custom, the House of Lords may not introduce a bill relating to taxation or [[Westminster System|Supply]], nor amend a bill so as to insert a provision relating to taxation or Supply, nor amend a Supply Bill in any way. The House of Commons is free to waive this privilege, and sometimes does so to allow the House of Lords to pass amendments with financial implications. The House of Lords remains free to reject bills relating to Supply and taxation, but may be over-ruled easily if the bills are Money Bills. (A bill relating to revenue and Supply may not be a Money Bill if, for example, it includes subjects other than national taxation and public funds).\n\nThe last stage of a bill involves the granting of the [[Royal Assent]]. Theoretically, the Sovereign may either grant or withhold Royal Assent (make the bill a law or veto the bill). In modern times the Sovereign always grants the Royal Assent, using the [[Anglo-Norman language|Norman French]] words \"[[La Reyne le veult]]\" (the Queen wishes it; \"Le Roy\" instead in the case of a king). The last refusal to grant the Assent was in 1708, when [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] withheld her Assent from a bill \"for the settling of Militia in Scotland\", in the words \"{{lang|xno|La reyne s'avisera}}\" (the Queen will think it over).\n\nThus, every bill obtains the assent of all three components of Parliament before it becomes law (except where the House of Lords is over-ridden under the [[Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949]]). The words \"BE IT ENACTED by the Queen's [King's] most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:-\",{{sfn|May|Chisholm|1911}} or, where the House of Lords' authority has been over-ridden by use of the Parliament Acts, the words \"BE IT ENACTED by The Queen's [King's] most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Commons in this present Parliament assembled, in accordance with the provisions of the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949, and by the authority of the same, as follows:-\" appear near the beginning of each Act of Parliament. These words are known as the [[enacting formula]].\n\n==Judicial functions==\nPrior to the creation of the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] in October 2009, Parliament also used to perform several judicial functions. The Queen-in-Parliament constituted the highest court in the realm for most purposes, but the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Privy Council]] had jurisdiction in some cases (for instance, appeals from ecclesiastical courts). The jurisdiction of Parliament arose from the ancient custom of petitioning the Houses to redress grievances and to do justice. The House of Commons ceased considering petitions to reverse the judgements of lower courts in 1399, effectively leaving the House of Lords as the court of last resort. In modern times, the [[judicial functions of the House of Lords]] were performed not by the whole House, but by a group of \"Lords of Appeal in Ordinary\" (judges granted life peerage dignities under the [[Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876]] by the Sovereign) and by \"Lords of Appeal\" (other peers with experience in the judiciary). However, under the [[Constitutional Reform Act 2005]], these judicial functions were transferred to the newly created [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]] in 2009, and the Lords of Appeal in Ordinary became the first Justices of the Court. Peers who hold high judicial office are no longer allowed to vote or speak in the Lords until they retire as Justices.\n\nIn the late 19th century, Acts allowed for the appointment of ''Scottish Lords of Appeal in Ordinary'' and ended appeal in Scottish criminal matters to the House of Lords, so that the [[High Court of Justiciary]] became the highest criminal court in [[Scotland]]. There is an argument that the provisions of Article XIX of the Union with England Act 1707 prevent any Court outside Scotland from hearing any appeal in criminal cases: ''\"And that the said Courts or any other of the like nature after the Unions shall have no power to Cognosce Review or Alter the Acts or Sentences of the Judicatures within Scotland or stop the Execution of the same.\"''  The House of Lords judicial committee usually had a minimum of two Scottish Judges to ensure that some experience of [[Scots law]] was brought to bear on Scottish appeals in civil cases, from the [[Court of Session]]. The Supreme Court now usually has at least three Scottish judges, together with at least two from Northern Ireland.  As Wales is developing its own judicature, it is likely that the same principle will be applied.\n\nCertain other judicial functions have historically been performed by the House of Lords. Until 1948, it was the body in which peers had to be tried for [[felony|felonies]] or [[high treason]]; now, they are tried by normal juries. The last occasion of the trial of a peer in the House of Lords was in 1935. When the House of Commons [[impeachment|impeaches]] an individual, the trial takes place in the House of Lords. Impeachments are now rare; the last one occurred in 1806. In 2006, a number of MPs attempted to revive the custom, having signed a motion for the impeachment of [[Tony Blair]], but this was unsuccessful.\n\n==Relationship with the UK Government==\nThe British Government is answerable to the House of Commons. However, neither the Prime Minister nor members of the Government are elected by the House of Commons. Instead, the Queen requests the person most likely to command the support of a majority in the House, normally the leader of the largest party in the House of Commons, to form a government. So that they may be accountable to the Lower House, the Prime Minister and most members of the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] are, by convention, members of the House of Commons. The last Prime Minister to be a member of the House of Lords was [[Alec Douglas-Home|Alec Douglas-Home, 14th Earl of Home]], who became Prime Minister in 1963. To adhere to the convention under which he was responsible to the Lower House, he disclaimed his peerage and procured election to the House of Commons within days of becoming Prime Minister.\n\nGovernments have a tendency to dominate the legislative functions of Parliament, by using their in-built majority in the House of Commons, and sometimes using their patronage power to appoint supportive peers in the Lords.{{Dubious|date=June 2010}} In practice, governments can pass any legislation (within reason) in the Commons they wish, unless there is major dissent by MPs in the governing party.{{Dubious|date=June 2010}}\nBut even in these situations, it is highly unlikely a bill will be defeated, though dissenting MPs may be able to extract concessions from the government. In 1976, [[Lord Hailsham]] created a now widely used name for this behaviour, in an academic paper called \"[[elective dictatorship]]\".\n\nParliament controls the executive by passing or rejecting its Bills and by forcing Ministers of the Crown to answer for their actions, either at [[Prime Minister's Questions|\"Question Time\"]] or during meetings of the [[List of Committees of the United Kingdom Parliament|parliamentary committees]]. In both cases, Ministers are asked questions by members of their Houses, and are obliged to answer.\n\nAlthough the House of Lords may scrutinise the executive through Question Time and through its committees, it cannot bring down the Government. A ministry must always retain the confidence and support of the House of Commons. The Lower House may indicate its lack of support by rejecting a [[Motion of no confidence votes in the United Kingdom|Motion of Confidence]] or by passing a [[Motion of no confidence votes in the United Kingdom|Motion of No Confidence]]. Confidence Motions are generally originated by the Government to reinforce its support in the House, whilst No Confidence Motions are introduced by the Opposition. The motions sometimes take the form \"That this House has [no] confidence in Her Majesty's Government\" but several other varieties, many referring to specific policies supported or opposed by Parliament, are used. For instance, a Confidence Motion of 1992 used the form, \"That this House expresses the support for the economic policy of Her Majesty's Government.\" Such a motion may theoretically be introduced in the House of Lords, but, as the Government need not enjoy the confidence of that House, would not be of the same effect as a similar motion in the House of Commons; the only modern instance of such an occurrence involves the 'No Confidence' motion that was introduced in 1993 and subsequently defeated.\n\nMany votes are considered votes of confidence, although not including the language mentioned above. Important bills that form part of the Government's agenda (as stated in the Speech from the Throne) are generally considered matters of confidence. The defeat of such a bill by the House of Commons indicates that a Government no longer has the confidence of that House. The same effect is achieved if the House of Commons \"[[Loss of supply|withdraws Supply]]\", that is, rejects the budget.\n\nWhere a Government has lost the confidence of the House of Commons, in other words has lost the ability to secure the basic requirement of the authority of the House of Commons to tax and to spend Government money, the Prime Minister is obliged either to resign, or seek the dissolution of Parliament and a new general election. Otherwise the machinery of government grinds to a halt within days.  The third choice - to mount a coup d'etat or an anti-democratic revolution - is hardly to be contemplated in the present age.  Though all three situations have arisen in recent years even in developed economies, international relations have allowed a disaster to be avoided.\n\nWhere a Prime Minister has ceased to retain the necessary majority and requests a dissolution, the Sovereign can in theory reject his or her request, forcing a resignation and allowing the [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]] to be asked to form a new government. This power is used extremely rarely. The conditions that should be met to allow such a refusal are known as the [[Lascelles Principles]]. These conditions and principles are [[Constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional conventions]] arising from the Sovereign's [[reserve power]]s as well as longstanding tradition and practice, not laid down in law.\n\nIn practice, the House of Commons' scrutiny of the Government is very weak. Since the [[first-past-the-post]] electoral system is employed in elections, the governing party tends to enjoy a large majority in the Commons; there is often limited need to compromise with other parties. Modern British political parties are so tightly organised that they leave relatively little room for free action by their MPs. In many cases, MPs may be expelled from their parties for voting against the instructions of party leaders. During the 20th century, the Government has lost confidence issues only three times\u2014twice in 1924, and once in 1979.\n\n===Parliamentary questions===\n{{see also|Question Time#United Kingdom|Prime Minister's Questions}}\nIn the United Kingdom, question time in the House of Commons lasts for an hour each day from Monday to Thursday (2:30 to 3:30&nbsp;pm on Mondays, 11:30&nbsp;am to 12:30&nbsp;pm on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, and 9:30 to 10:30&nbsp;am on Thursdays). Each Government department has its place in a rota which repeats every five weeks. The exception to this sequence are the Business Questions (Questions to the [[Leader of House of Commons]]), in which questions are answered each Thursday about the business of the House the following week. Also, [[Questions to the Prime Minister]] takes place each Wednesday from noon to 12:30&nbsp;pm.\n\nIn addition to government departments, there are also questions to the Church commissioners.<ref name=\"pdf\" /> Additionally, each Member of Parliament is entitled to table questions for written answer. Written questions are addressed to the Ministerial head of a government department, usually a [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|Secretary of State]], but they are often answered by a [[Minister of State]] or [[Parliamentary Under Secretary of State]]. Written Questions are submitted to the Clerks of the Table Office, either on paper or electronically, and answers are recorded in ''[[Hansard|The Official Report (Hansard)]]'' so as to be widely available and accessible.<ref name=\"pdf\" />\n\nIn the House of Lords, a half-hour is set aside each afternoon at the start of the day's proceedings for Lords' oral questions. A peer submits a question in advance, which then appears on the [[Order Paper]] for the day's proceedings.<ref name=\"pdf\" /> The Lord shall say: \"''My Lords, I beg leave to ask the Question standing in my name on the Order Paper''\". The Minister responsible then answers the question. The Lord is then allowed to ask a supplementary question and other peers ask further questions on the theme of the original put down on the order paper. (For instance, if the question regards immigration, Lords can ask the Minister any question related to immigration during the allowed period).<ref name=\"pdf\">{{cite web\n |author=House of Commons Information Office \n |title=Parliamentary Questions: House of Commons Information Office Factsheet P1 \n |date=June 2005 \n |url=http://www.parliament.uk/documents/upload/p01.pdf \n |deadurl=yes \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061016215929/http://www.parliament.uk/documents/upload/p01.pdf \n |archivedate=16 October 2006 \n}}\n</ref>\n\n==Sovereignty==\n[[File:Stormont Parliamentary Building 01.JPG|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Parliament Buildings (Northern Ireland)|Parliament Buildings]], [[Stormont, Belfast|Stormont]], [[Northern Ireland]] is home to the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]].]]\nSeveral different views have been taken of Parliament's sovereignty. According to the jurist [[William Blackstone|Sir William Blackstone]], \"It has sovereign and uncontrollable authority in making, confirming, enlarging, restraining, abrogating, repealing, reviving, and expounding of laws, concerning matters of all possible denominations, ecclesiastical, or temporal, civil, military, maritime, or criminal ... it can, in short, do every thing that is not naturally impossible.\"\n\nA different view has been taken by the Scottish judge [[Thomas Cooper, 1st Baron Cooper of Culross|Lord Cooper of Culross]]. When he decided the 1953 case of ''[[MacCormick v. Lord Advocate]]'' as [[Court of Session|Lord President of the Court of Session]], he stated, \"The principle of unlimited sovereignty of Parliament is a distinctively English principle and has no counterpart in Scottish constitutional law.\" He continued, \"Considering that the [[Act of Union 1707|Union legislation]] extinguished the Parliaments of Scotland and England and replaced them by a new Parliament, I have difficulty in seeing why the new Parliament of Great Britain must inherit all the peculiar characteristics of the English Parliament but none of the Scottish.\" Nevertheless, he did not give a conclusive opinion on the subject.\n\nThus, the question of Parliamentary sovereignty appears to remain unresolved. Parliament has not passed any Act defining its own sovereignty. A related possible limitation on Parliament relates to the Scottish legal system and Presbyterian faith, preservation of which were Scottish preconditions to the creation of the unified Parliament. Since the Parliament of the United Kingdom was set up in reliance on these promises, it may be that it has no power to make laws that break them.\n\nParliament's power has often been eroded by its own Acts. Acts passed in [[Church of Scotland Act 1921|1921]] and 1925 granted the [[Church of Scotland]] complete independence in ecclesiastical matters. More recently, its power has been restricted by membership of the [[European Union]], which has the power to make laws enforceable in each member state. In the [[Factortame case]], the [[European Court of Justice]] ruled that British courts could have powers to overturn British legislation contravening European law.\n\nParliament has also created national devolved parliaments and assemblies with differing degrees of legislative authority in [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]]. Parliament still has the power over areas for which responsibility lies with the devolved institutions, but would gain the agreement of those institutions to act on their behalf. Similarly, it has granted the power to make regulations to Ministers of the Crown, and the power to enact religious legislation to the [[General Synod]] of the Church of England. (Measures of the General Synod and, in some cases proposed [[statutory instrument]]s made by ministers, must be approved by both Houses before they become law.)\n\nIn every case aforementioned, authority has been conceded by Act of Parliament and may be taken back in the same manner. It is entirely within the authority of Parliament, for example, to abolish the devolved governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland or to leave the EU. However, Parliament also revoked its legislative competence over Australia and Canada with the [[Australia Act|Australia]] and [[Canada Act 1982|Canada Acts]]: although the Parliament of the United Kingdom could pass an Act reversing its action, it would not take effect in Australia or Canada as the competence of the '''Imperial Parliament''' is no longer recognised there in law.\n\nOne well-recognised exception to Parliament's power involves binding future Parliaments. No Act of Parliament may be made secure from amendment or repeal by a future Parliament. For example, although the [[Act of Union 1800]] states that the Kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland are to be united \"forever\", Parliament permitted southern Ireland to leave the United Kingdom in 1922.\n\nOn 22 March 2017 an [[Islamic terrorism|Islamist]]-related terror attack happened in which [[2017 Westminster attack|a man stabbed a police officer]] after ploughing into pedestrians on [[Westminster Bridge]]. Five people were killed, including the attacker and the police officer.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-39359158|title=London attack: Four dead in Westminster terror incident|publisher=BBC News|date=22 March 2017}}.

The House of Lords relies on inherent right. In the case of the House of Commons, the Speaker goes to the Lords' Chamber at the beginning of each new Parliament and requests representatives of the Sovereign to confirm the Lower House's \"undoubted\" privileges and rights. The ceremony observed by the House of Commons dates to the reign of King Henry VIII. Each House is the guardian of its privileges, and may punish breaches thereof. The extent of parliamentary privilege is based on law and custom. Sir William Blackstone states that these privileges are \"very large and indefinite\", and cannot be defined except by the Houses of Parliament themselves.\n\nThe foremost privilege claimed by both Houses is that of [[freedom of speech]] in debate; nothing said in either House may be questioned in any court or other institution outside Parliament. Another privilege claimed is that of freedom from arrest; at one time this was held to apply for any arrest except for [[high treason]], [[felony]] or [[breach of the peace]] but it now excludes any arrest on criminal charges; it applies during a session of Parliament, and 40 days before or after such a session.<ref>{{cite web| title = United Kingdom; Member of Parliament | work = PARLINE database on national parliaments | publisher = [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]] | url = http://www.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/2336_D.htm | accessdate = 22 February 2008 }}</ref> Members of both Houses are no longer privileged from service on [[jury|juries]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=[[Erskine May: Parliamentary Practice]] |last=May |first=Erskine |authorlink=Erskine May, 1st Baron Farnborough |year=2004 |publisher=Lexis Nexis UK |isbn=0-406-97094-7 |pages=119, 125 }}</ref>\n\nBoth Houses possess the power to punish breaches of their privilege.

This provoked mockery from a newly elected 20-year-old MP who described it as \"ridiculous\" snobbery.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Chips are down as Mhairi heads for the canteen|last=Lo Dico|first=Joy|date=18 May 2015|work=[[London Evening Standard]]|page=16|access-date=|via=}}</ref>\n\n==Emblem==\n[[File:Parliament portcullis.png|right|thumb|upright=0.65|The Crowned [[Portcullis]] of Parliament]]\n\nThe quasi-official emblem of the Houses of Parliament is a crowned [[portcullis]]. The portcullis was originally the badge of various English noble families from the 14th century. It went on to be adopted by the kings of the [[Tudor dynasty]] in the 16th century, under whom the Palace of Westminster became the regular meeting place of Parliament. The crown was added to make the badge a specifically royal symbol.\n\nThe portcullis probably first came to be associated with the [[Palace of Westminster]] through its use as decoration in the rebuilding of the Palace after the fire of 1512. However, at the time it was only one of many symbols. The widespread use of the portcullis throughout the Palace dates from the 19th century, when [[Charles Barry]] and [[Augustus Pugin]] used it extensively as a decorative feature in their designs for the new Palace built following the disastrous 1834 fire.\n\nThe crowned portcullis came to be accepted during the 20th century as the emblem of both houses of parliament. This was simply a result of custom and usage rather than a specific decision. The emblem now appears on official stationery, publications and papers, and is stamped on various items in use in the Palace of Westminster, such as cutlery, silverware and china.<ref>[http://www.parliament.uk/documents/documents/upload/2009-HCIO-Factsheet-Portcullis.pdf The Portcullis (factsheet)], House of Commons Information Office, November 2007</ref> Various shades of red and green are used for visual identification of the [[House of Lords]] and the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]].\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=32em}}\n* [[History of democracy]]\n* ''[[The History of Parliament]]''\n* [[Act of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Act of Parliament]]\n* [[List of Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom]]\n* [[Acts of Parliament of the United Kingdom relating to the European Communities and the European Union]]\n* [[List of British governments]]\n* [[List of Parliamentary constituencies in the United Kingdom]]\n* [[List of Parliaments of the United Kingdom]]\n* [[Parliamentary agents]]\n* [[Parliamentary Brief]]\n* [[Parliament in the Making]]\n* [[Parliamentary records of the United Kingdom]]\n* [[Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology]]\n* [[Parliament Week]]\n* [[Records of members of parliament of the United Kingdom]]\n* [[Parliament of the United Kingdom relocation]]\n* [[TheyWorkForYou]]\n* [[Westminster system]]\n{{div col end}}\n'''Lists of MPs elected:'''\n{{div col|colwidth=35em}}\n* [[List of MPs elected in the United Kingdom general election, 1966]]\n* [[List of MPs elected in the United Kingdom general election, 1970]]\n* [[MPs elected in the United Kingdom general election, February 1974]]\n* [[MPs elected in the United Kingdom general election, October 1974]]\n* [[List of MPs elected in the United Kingdom general election, 1979]]\n* [[List of MPs elected in the United Kingdom general election, 1983]]\n* [[List of MPs elected in the United Kingdom general election, 1987]]\n* [[List of MPs elected in the United Kingdom general election, 1992]]\n* [[List of MPs elected in the United Kingdom general election, 1997]]\n* [[List of MPs elected in the United Kingdom general election, 2001]]\n* [[List of MPs elected in the United Kingdom general election, 2005]]\n* [[List of MPs elected in the United Kingdom general election, 2010]]\n* [[List of MPs elected in the United Kingdom general election, 2015]]\n* [[List of MPs elected in the United Kingdom general election, 2017]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last=Blackstone |first=Sir William |year=1765 |title=Commentaries on the Laws of England |location=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon Press|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |first1=K.

He is one of the [[Twelve Minor Prophets|Twelve Prophets]] of the Jewish [[Hebrew Bible]], also known as the [[Minor Prophets]] of the Christian [[Old Testament]].<ref name=EB1911>{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Hosea |volume=13 |pages=784\u2013786 |first1=William Robertson |last1=Smith |first2=Henry Wheeler |last2=Robinson}}</ref> Hosea is often seen as a \"prophet of doom\", but underneath his message of destruction is a promise of restoration. The [[Talmud]] claims that he was the greatest prophet of his generation.<ref>[[Pesachim]] 87a</ref> The period of Hosea's ministry extended to some sixty years and he was the only prophet of Israel of his time who left any written prophecy.\n\n==Name==\nThe name \"Hosea\", meaning \"salvation\", or \"He saves\", or \"He helps\", seems to have been not uncommon, being derived from the auspicious verb from which we have the frequently recurring word \"salvation\". It may be a contraction of a larger form of which the divine name ([[Tetragrammaton|YHWH]]) or its abbreviation formed a part, so as to signify \"YHWH helps\". According to the Bible\n[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers+13:8&version=NKJV Numbers 13:8], [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers+13:16&version=NKJV 13:16] that was the original name of [[Joshua|Joshua, son of Nun]], until [[Moses]] gave him the longer, [[theophoric name]] ''Yehoshua'', \"YHWH is salvation\".{{citation needed|date =June 2018}}\n\n==Location==\nAlthough it is not expressly stated in the [[Book of Hosea]], it is apparent from the level of detail and familiarity focused on northern geography, that Hosea conducted his prophetic ministries in the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Northern Israel (Samaria)]] of which he was a native.<ref name=je>[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/7894-hosea-the-prophet Hirsch, Emil G. and Ryssel, Victor. \"Hosea, the Prophet\", ''Jewish Encyclopedia'']{{PD-notice}}</ref> In Hosea 5:8 ff., there seems to be a reference to the [[Syro-Ephraimite War]] which led to the capture of the kingdom by the Assyrians (c. 734\u2013732 BC). Hosea\u2019s long ministry (ca. 750\u2013725) seems to have ended before the fall of Samaria in 722/721.<ref name=Intro>[http://www.usccb.org/bible/scripture.cfm?bk=Hosea&ch= \"Introduction\", Hosea, ''New American Bible'', Revised Edition.]</ref>\n\n==Family==\nLittle is known about the life or social status of Hosea. According to the Book of Hosea, he married [[Gomer (wife of Hosea)|Gomer]], the daughter of Diblaim,<ref name=EB1911/> but she proved to be unfaithful. Hosea, however, knew nothing of her character at the time of his marriage; on the contrary, it was made manifest to him only afterward, as if through a special intervention of God, in order to serve to the prophet as a symbol of Israel's unfaithfulness to the Lord.<ref name=je/> His marriage will dramatize the breakdown in the relationship between God and His people Israel.<ref name=mjl>[https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/hosea-amos-prophets-to-the-north/ \"Hosea & Amos: Prophets to the North\", My Jewish Learning]</ref> Hosea's family life reflected the \"adulterous\" relationship which Israel had built with polytheistic gods.\n\n[[File:Duccio di Buoninsegna 063.jpg|thumb|''The Prophet Hosea'', by [[Duccio di Buoninsegna]], in the [[Cathedral (Siena)|Siena Cathedral]] (c. 1309\u20131311)]]\nSimilarly, his children's names represent God\u2019s estrangement from Israel.<ref name=mjl/> They are prophetic of the fall of the ruling dynasty and the severed covenant with God &ndash; much like the prophet [[Isaiah]] a generation later. The name of Hosea's daughter, Lo-ruhamah, which translates as \"not pitied\", is chosen as a sign of displeasure with the people of Israel for following false gods. (In Hosea 2:23 she is redeemed, shown mercy with the term ''Ruhamah''.) The name of Hosea's son, Lo-ammi, which translates as \"not my people\", is chosen as a sign of the Lord's displeasure with the people of Israel for following those false gods (see Hosea 1:8\u20139).\n\n==Christian thought==\nOne of the early writing prophets, Hosea used his own experience as a symbolic representation of God and Israel. The relationship between Hosea and Gomer parallels the relationship between God and Israel. Even though Gomer runs away from Hosea and sleeps with another man, he loves her anyway and forgives her. Likewise, even though the people of Israel worshipped false gods, God continued to love them and did not abandon his covenant with them.<ref name=Intro/>\n\nThe Book of Hosea was a severe warning to the northern kingdom against the growing idolatry being practiced there;  the book was a dramatic call to repentance.  Christians extend the analogy of Hosea to Christ and the church: Christ the husband, [[Bride of Christ|his church the bride]].  Christians see in this book a comparable call to the church not to forsake the Lord Jesus Christ. Christians also take the buying back of Gomer as the redemptive qualities of Jesus Christ's sacrifice on the cross.\n\nOther preachers, like Charles Spurgeon, saw Hosea as a striking presentation of the mercy of God in his sermon on Hosea 1:7 titled The LORD's Own Salvation. \u201cBut I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save them by the Lord their God, and will not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle, by horses, nor by horsemen.\u201d \u2013 Hosea 1:7 in his sermon NO. 2057, December 16TH, 1888.\n\n==Islamic literature==\nThe [[Qur'an]] mentions only some prophets by name, but makes it clear that many were sent who are not mentioned.<ref>Qur'an 40:78</ref> Therefore, many [[Muslim]] [[scholar]]s, such as ([[Ibn Ishaq]]), speak of Hosea as one of the true [[Hebrew]] [[prophet]]s of [[Israel]]. The [[Book of Hosea]] has also been used in Qur'anic exegesis by [[Abdullah Yusuf Ali]], especially in reference to Qur'anic verses which speak of the backsliding of [[Israel]].<ref>[[Abdullah Yusuf Ali]] refers to Hosea 8:14 for his notes on Q. 5:60</ref>\n\n==Observances==\nHe is commemorated with the other [[Minor prophet]]s in the [[Calendar of Saints (Armenian Apostolic Church)|Calendar of saints]] of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] on July 31. He is commemorated on the [[Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar]], with a [[feast day]] on October 17 (for those churches which follow the [[Julian Calendar]], October 17 currently falls on October 30 of the modern [[Gregorian Calendar]]). He is also commemorated on the Sunday of the Holy Fathers (the Sunday before the [[Christmas|Nativity of the Lord]]).\n\n==Tomb of Hosea==\n[[File:Hosea's tomb.jpg|thumb|The structure at the cemetery in [[Safed]] known as the Tomb of Hosea.]]\nJewish tradition holds that the tomb of Hosea is a structure located in the Jewish cemetery of [[Safed]],<ref>{{Cite book|title=Minor Prophets in a Major Key|last=Woodall|first=Chris|publisher=Wipf & Stock Publishers|year=2018|isbn=9781532642180|location=Eugene, OR|pages=5}}</ref> however, [[Emil G.

Jewish sources, however, do not group him with those two prophets, who are often placed together, so it is possible that he was slightly earlier than the pair.\n\nBecause the final chapter of his book is a song, it is sometimes assumed that he was a member of the [[tribe of Levi]], which served as musicians in [[Solomon's Temple]].{{sfnp|Lehrman|1948|p=211}}\n\n===Name===\nThe name Habakkuk, or Habacuc,{{refn|group=lower-alpha|The spelling \"Habacuc\" is the one used in the [[Douay\u2013Rheims Bible]], an official translation of the Roman Catholic Vulgate into English{{sfnp|Leslie|1962}} that was completed in 1610.

Verses 33\u201339 state that Habakkuk is in Judea and after making some stew, he's told by the [[angel of the Lord]] to take the stew to Daniel, who is in [[Babylon]] in the lion's den. After proclaiming he is unaware of both the den and Babylon, the angel transports Habakkuk to the lion's den. Habakkuk gives Daniel the food to sustain him, and is immediately taken back to \"his own place\".\n\nHabakkuk is also mentioned in [[Lives of the Prophets]], which also notes his time in Babylon.{{sfnp|Coogan|2009|p=298}}\n\nAccording to the [[Zohar]] (Volume 1, page 8b) Habakkuk is the boy born to the Shunamite woman through [[Elisha]]'s blessing:\n\n{{quote|1= And he said, About this season, according to the time of life, thou shalt '''embrace''' ({{lang|he|\u05d7\u05d1\u05e7\u05ea}}&nbsp;\u2013 hoveket, therefore Habakkuk) a son. And she said, Nay, my lord, [thou] man of God, do not lie unto thine handmaid.<ref>({{Bibleverse|2|Kings|4:16|HE}})</ref>}}\n\n==Works==\n{{Main|Book of Habakkuk}}\n\nThe only work attributed to Habakkuk is the short book of the Bible that bears his name. The book of Habbakuk consists of five oracles about the [[Chaldea]]ns ([[Babylonia]]ns) and a song of praise to [[God]].\n\nThe style of the book has been praised by many scholars,{{sfnp|Irving|1908|p=52}} suggesting that its author was a man of great literary talent. The entire book follows the structure of a [[chiasmus]] in which [[Parallelism (rhetoric)|parallelism of thought]] is used to bracket sections of the text.{{sfnp|Walker|Lund|1934}}\n\nHabakkuk is unusual among the prophets in that he openly questions the working of God (1:3a, 1:13b).{{sfnp|Achtemeier|1993|p=265}} In the first part of the first chapter, the Prophet sees the injustice among his people and asks why God does not take action: \"O LORD, how long shall I cry for help, and you will not hear? Or cry to you \u201cViolence!\u201d and you will not save?\" (1:2, ESV).\n\n==Tombs==\nThe final resting place of Habakkuk has been claimed at multiple locations. The fifth-century Christian historian [[Sozomen]] claimed that the relics of Habakkuk were found at Cela, when God revealed their location to [[Zebennus]], bishop of [[Eleutheropolis]], in a dream.{{sfnp|Sozomen|1855|p=358}} Currently, one location in Israel and one in Iran lay claim to being the burial site of the prophet.\n\n===Tomb in Israel===\n[[File:Prophet Habakkuk Tomb ap 002.jpg|thumb|right|Tomb of Habakkuk near [[Kadarim]], Israel.]]\nThe burial place of Habakkuk is identified by Jewish tradition as a hillside in the [[Upper Galilee Regional Council|Upper Galilee]] region of northern [[Israel]], close to the villages [[Kadarim]] and [[Hukok]], about six miles southwest of [[Safed]] and twelve miles north of [[Mount Tabor]].{{sfnp|Hirsch|Seligsohn|1906}} A small stone building, erected during the 20th century, protects the tomb.{{sfnp|MyTzadik}} Tradition dating as early as the 12th century AD holds that Habakkuk's tomb is at this location,{{sfnp|Lissovsky|2008}} but the tomb may also be of a local [[sheikh]] of [[Yaquq]], a name related to the biblical place named \"Hukkok\",<ref>{{bibleref|Joshua|19:34|ESV}}</ref> whose pronunciation and spelling in Hebrew are close to \"Habakkuk\".{{sfnp|Ben Yosef|2007}} Archaeological findings in this location include several burial places dated to the [[Second Temple period]].\n\n===Persian shrine===\n[[File:Habakuk mausoleum Tuyserkan Iran.jpg|thumb|right|Shrine of Habakkuk in [[Tuyserkan]], [[Iran]].]]\nA [[mausoleum]] southeast of the city of [[Tuyserkan]] in the west of [[Iran]] is also believed to be Habakkuk's burial place.{{sfnp|Toyserkan.com}} It is protected by Iran's [[Cultural Heritage, Handcrafts and Tourism Organization]]. The Organization's guide to the [[Hamadan Province]] states that Habakkuk was believed to be a guardian to [[Solomon's Temple]], and that he was captured by the Babylonians and remained in their prison for some years. After being freed by [[Cyrus the Great]], he went to [[Ecbatana]] and remained there until he died, and was buried somewhere nearby, in what is today Tuyserkan. Habakkuk is called both Habaghugh and Hayaghugh by the Muslim locals.\n\nThe surrounding shrine may date to the period of the [[Seljuq Empire]] (11\u201312th century); it consists of an octagonal wall and conical dome. Underneath the shrine is a hidden basement with three floors. In the center of the shrine's courtyard is the grave where Habakkuk is said to be buried. A stone upon the grave is inscribed in both Hebrew and [[Persian language|Persian]] stating that the prophet's father was Shioua Lovit, and his mother was Lesho Namit. Both Muslims and Jews visit it to pay their respects.{{sfnp|Tehran Jewish Committee}}\n\n==Commemoration==\n===Christian===\nOn the [[Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar]], his feast day is December 2.{{sfnp|McBrien|2001|p=485}} In the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]], the twelve minor prophets are read in the [[Roman Breviary]] during the fourth and fifth weeks of November,{{sfnp|Batiffol|1898|p=265}} which are the last two weeks of the liturgical year, and his feast day is January 15.{{sfnp|Benedictine Monks|1920|p=131}}{{refn|group=lower-alpha|While has been stated that the feastday of Habbakuk is January 15 in the Roman Liturgy, this is an error arising from confusion with the early Christian martyr Abachum or Abacus, who is recorded in the current [[Roman Martyrology]] on January 19, along with Saints [[Marius, Martha, Audifax, and Abachum|Marius, Martha, and Audifax]],{{sfnp|Martyrologium|2004}} all of whom are thought to have been martyred in 270 and buried that day or 20 January.

Among his many proofs, Imam Ridha asks \"Do you know the prophet Habakkuk?\" He said, \u201cYes. I know of him.\u201d al-Ridha said, \u201cand this is narrated in your book, \u2018Allah brought down speech on Mount Faran, and the heavens were \ufb01lled with the glori\ufb01cation of Muhammad and his community.

Qur'an 16:36</ref> Thus, Muslims have traditionally had no problem accepting those other Hebrew prophets not mentioned in the [[Quran]] or [[hadith]] as legitimate prophets of God, especially as the Quran itself states: \"Surely We sent down the [[Torah]] (to Moses), wherein is guidance and light; thereby the Prophets (who followed him), who had surrendered themselves, gave judgment for those who were Jewish, as did the masters and the [[rabbi]]s, following such portion of God's Book as they were given to keep and were witnesses to,\"<ref>Qur'an 5:44, cf. Arberry translation.</ref> with this passage having often been interpreted by Muslims to include within the phrase \"prophets\" an allusion to all the prophetic figures of the Jewish scriptural portion of the [[nevi'im]], that is to say all the prophets of Israel after [[Moses]] and [[Aaron]].

He may have been one of the [[Babylonian captivity|captives taken to Babylon]] by [[Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon|Nebuchadnezzar]]. He began God\u2019s prophesy about sixteen years after the [[Babylonian captivity#Return|return of the Jews to Judah]] (ca. 520 BCE). The work of rebuilding the [[Second Temple|temple]] had been put to a stop through the intrigues of the [[Samaritan]]s. After having been suspended for eighteen years, the work was resumed through the efforts of Haggai and Zechariah.<ref>{{Bibleverse||Ezra|6:14|131}}</ref> They exhorted the people, which roused them from their lethargy, and induced them to take advantage of a change in the policy of the Persian government under [[Darius I]].\n\nThe name Haggai, with various vocalizations, is also found in the [[Book of Esther]], as a [[Eunuch (court official)|eunuch]] servant of the [[Esther|Queen]].\n\n== Haggai Prophecies ==\n[[File:Tissot Haggai.jpg|thumb|150px|Haggai (watercolor circa 1896\u20131902 by [[James Tissot]])]]\nHaggai prophesied in 520 BCE Jerusalem, about the people needing to complete building the Temple. The new Temple was bound to exceed the awesomeness of the previous Temple. He claimed if the Temple was not built there would be poverty, famine and drought affecting the Jewish nation.\n\nThere is a controversy regarding who edited Haggai's works. According to scholars,  they credit it to his students. However, Jewish Tradition believe, that the Men of the Great Assembly were responsible for the edits. The Men of the Great Assembly are traditionally known for continuing the work of Ezra and Nehemiah.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Haggai and officials of his time==\nHaggai supported the officials of his time, specifically [[Zerubbabel]], the governor, and [[Joshua the High Priest]]. In the Book of Haggai, God refers to Zerubbabel as \"my servant\" as King David was, and says he will make him as a \"signet ring,\" as King Jehoiachin was (Haggai 2:23; cf. Jer 22:24). The signet ring symbolized a ring worn on the hand of Yahweh, showing that a king held divine favour.  Thus, Haggai is implicitly, but not explicitly, saying that Zerubbabel would preside over a restored Davidic kingdom.<ref>{{cite book |last=Coogan |first=Michael |title=A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2009 |page=346 |isbn=0195332725 }}</ref>\n\n== Jewish Persian Diplomacy ==\nThe Persian Empire was growing weak, and Haggai saw time as an opportunity to restore the Davidic Kingdom. He believed that the Kingdom of David was able to rise and take back their part in Jewish issues. Haggai\u2019s message was directed to the nobles and Zerubbabel, as he would be the first Davidic monarch restored. He saw this as important because the Kingdom would be an end to Jewish Idol worship.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Haggai in Jewish tradition==\nHaggai, in rabbinic writing, is often referred to as one of the men of the [[Great Assembly]]. The [[Babylonian Talmud]] (5th century CE) mentions a tradition concerning the prophet Haggai,<ref>Babylonian Talmud (''Yebamot'' 16a)</ref> saying that he gave instruction concerning three things: (a) that it is not lawful for a man whose brother married his daughter (as a co-wife in a polygamous relationship) to consummate a [[levirate marriage]] with one of his deceased brother's co-wives (a teaching accepted by the [[School of Hillel]], but rejected by the [[School of Shammai]]);<ref>A quintessential Jewish teaching, since it is lawful for a Jewish man to marry his brother's daughter, or his sister's daughter. Likewise, [[polygamy]] was permitted under [[Mosaic law]], as also the biblical injunction to take in marriage the wife of one's deceased brother (Heb. ''Yibum'' = levirate marriage) when they had no offspring. The problem, however, that arises here is that a man whose daughter was married to his brother, had his brother died childless, he (the living brother who is the father of his brother's wife) could not consummate a marriage with his own daughter, a thing prohibited in Jewish law, and therefore even the co-wives of his brother assume the same prohibition and are forbidden for him to marry.</ref> (b) that Jews living in the regions of [[Ammon]] and [[Moab]] separate from their produce the [[Poor tithe|poor man's tithe]] during the [[Sabbatical year (Bible)|Sabbatical year]]; (c) that they accept of proselytes from the peoples of [[Tadmor]] (Palmyra) and from the people of [[Kardu|\u1e32ardu]].\n\n== Liturgical commemoration ==\nOn the [[Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar]], Haggai is commemorated as a [[saint]] and prophet. His [[feast day]] is 16 December (for those churches which follow the traditional [[Julian Calendar]], 16 December currently falls on 29 December of the modern [[Gregorian Calendar]]). He is also commemorated, in common with the other righteous persons of the Old Testament, on the Sunday of the Holy Fathers (the Sunday before the [[Christmas|Nativity of the Lord]]).\n\nHaggai is commemorated with the other [[Minor prophet]]s in the [[Calendar of Saints (Armenian Apostolic Church)|Calendar of saints]] of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] on 31 July.\n\n== Haggai in Freemasonry ==\nIn the Masonic degree of [[Holy Royal Arch]] Haggai is one of the Three Principals of the Chapter. Named after Haggai the prophet and accompanies [[Zerubbabel]], Prince of the People, and [[Joshua the High Priest|Joshua, the son of Josedech, the High Priest]].\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Book of Haggai]]\n*[[Tomb of the Prophets Haggai, Zechariah and Malachi]]\n\n== References ==\n* {{EBD|wstitle=Haggai}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://ocafs.oca.org/FeastSaintsViewer.asp?SID=4&ID=1&FSID=103556 Prophet Haggai] Orthodox [[icon]] and [[synaxarion]]\n\n{{Prophets of the Tanakh}}\n{{Catholic saints}}\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:6th-century BC writers]]\n[[Category:Christian saints from the Old Testament]]\n<!-- Don't need head category [[:Category:Prophets in Judaism]] or [[Category:Prophets in Christianity]], both hold sub-cat [[:Category:Prophets of the Hebrew Bible]] which is in the template {{Prophets of the Tanakh}} -->", "sha1": "gi5ik0a62ckvgdchkmtbqzaxsijdh7g"}}, {"title": "Herman Hollerith", "ns": "0", "id": "13969", "revision": {"id": "866753017", "parentid": "866752974", "timestamp": "2018-11-01T10:07:35Z", "contributor": {"username": "RHcosm", "id": "34625434"}, "comment": "Reverted 1 edit by [[Special:Contributions/157.39.232.166|157.39.232.166]] ([[User talk:157.39.232.166|talk]]) to last revision by 67.160.197.209.

For example, if a specific hole location indicates ''marital status'', then a hole there can indicate ''married'' while not having a hole indicates ''single''.  Hollerith determined that data in specified locations on a card, the now-familiar rows and columns, could be counted or sorted electromechanically. A description of this system, ''An Electric Tabulating System (1889)'', was submitted by Hollerith to Columbia University as his doctoral thesis, and is reprinted in Randell's book.<ref>{{cite book | editor-last = Randell | editor-first = Brian | title = The Origins of Digital Computers, Selected Papers |edition=3rd | publisher = Springer-Verlag | year = 1982 | isbn = 0-387-11319-3}}</ref> On January 8, 1889, Hollerith was issued U.S. Patent 395,782,<ref name=HPatent>{{Cite patent|country=US|number=395782|status=patent|title=Art of compiling statistics|inventor=Herman Hollerith|pridate=1884-09-23|gdate=1889-01-08}}</ref> claim 2 of which reads:\n[[File:Card puncher - NARA - 513295.jpg|thumb|left|Photo dated December 31, 1919 <!-- date is found within a group of photos, not with this individual photo--> of census worker with Hollerith pantograph punch.

Prehistoric men may have painted animals to \"catch\" their [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] or [[spirit]] in order to hunt them more easily or the paintings may represent an [[animistic]] vision and homage to surrounding [[nature]].

Mostly, animals were painted, not only animals that were used as food but also animals that represented strength like the [[rhinoceros]] or large [[Felidae]], as in the Chauvet Cave. Signs like dots were sometimes drawn. Rare human representations include handprints and stencils, and figures depicting [[therianthrope|human / animal]] hybrids. The Chauvet Cave in the [[Ard\u00e8che]] [[Departments of France]] contains the most important preserved cave paintings of the Paleolithic era, painted around 31,000 BC. The [[Altamira (cave)|Altamira]] cave paintings in Spain were done 14,000 to 12,000 BC and show, among others, [[bison]]s. The hall of bulls in [[Lascaux]], Dordogne, France, is one of the best known cave paintings and dates to about 15,000 to 10,000 BC.\n\nIf there is meaning to the paintings, it remains unknown. The caves were not in an inhabited area, so they may have been used for seasonal rituals. The animals are accompanied by signs which suggest a possible magic use. Arrow-like symbols in Lascaux are sometimes interpreted as being used as [[calendar]]s or [[almanac]]s, but the evidence remains inconclusive.<ref>M.

The earliest paintings were not representational but ornamental; they consisted of patterns or designs rather than pictures. Early pottery was painted with spirals, zigzags, dots, or animals. It was only during the [[Warring States period]] (403\u2013221 B.C.) that artists began to represent the world around them. [[Japanese painting]] is one of the oldest and most highly refined of the [[Japanese art]]s, encompassing a wide variety of genre and styles. The history of Japanese painting is a long history of synthesis and competition between native [[Japanese aesthetics]] and adaptation of imported ideas. Korean painting, as an independent form, began around 108 B.C., around the fall of [[Gojoseon]], making it one of the oldest in the world. The artwork of that time period evolved into the various styles that characterized the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]] period, most notably the paintings and frescoes that adorn the tombs of [[Goguryeo]]'s royalty. During the Three Kingdoms period and through the [[Goryeo dynasty]], Korean painting was characterized primarily by a combination of Korean-style landscapes, facial features, Buddhist-centered themes, and an emphasis on celestial observation that was facilitated by the rapid development of Korean astronomy.\n\n===East Asian===\n''See also [[Chinese painting]], [[Japanese painting]], [[Korean painting]].''\n<gallery widths=\"140px\" heights=\"140px\" perrow=\"4\">\nFile:Lacquer painting from Ch'u State.jpg|A [[lacquerware]] painting from the Jingmen Tomb (Chinese: \u834a\u9580\u695a\u5893; Pinyin: J\u012bngm\u00e9n ch\u01d4 m\u00f9) of the [[State of Chu]] (704\u2013223 BC), depicting men wearing precursors to ''[[Hanfu]]'' (i.e. traditional [[silk]] dress) and riding in a two-horsed [[chariot]]\nFile:Confucius, fresco from a Western Han tomb of Dongping County, Shandong province, China.jpg|Detail of a fresco showing the Chinese philosopher [[Confucius]], from a [[Western Han]] (202 BC - 9 AD) tomb of [[Dongping County]], [[Shandong province]]\nFile:Western Han Dynasty Woman, Han Tomb in Sian, Shensi.jpg|A Chinese woman in ''[[Hanfu]]'' attire, fresco from a [[Western Han]] (202 BC - 9 AD) tomb of [[Xi'an]] (ancient [[Chang'an]]), [[Shaanxi province]]\nImage:Guardians of Day and Night, Han Dynasty.jpg|Paintings on tile of guardian spirits donned in [[Han Chinese clothing|Chinese robes]], from the [[Han Dynasty]] (202 BC \u2013 220 AD)\nFile:Gentlemen in conversation, Eastern Han Dynasty.jpg|''Gentlemen in Conversation'', tomb painting dated to the [[Eastern Han Dynasty]] (25\u2013220 AD).\nFile:Basket from Lo-lang.jpg|[[Lacquerware]] basket from the [[Lelang Commandery]], showing seated men wearing ''[[Hanfu]]'' robes, [[Eastern Han Dynasty]] (25-220 AD)\nFile:Dahuting mural, Eastern Han Dynasty.jpg|Female court attendants wearing ''[[Hanfu]]'' robes, a mural from an [[Eastern Han]] (25-220 AD) tomb in [[Zhengzhou]], [[Henan province]]\nFile:Dahuting tomb mural detail of women wearing hanfu, Eastern Han period.jpg|Female court attendants wearing ''[[Hanfu]]'' robes, a mural from an [[Eastern Han]] (25-220 AD) tomb in [[Zhengzhou]], [[Henan province]]\nFile:Male figure from a lacquer painting over wood, Northern Wei.jpg|Male figure wearing ''[[Hanfu]]'' robes, from a lacquerware painting over wood, [[Northern Wei]] period, 5th century AD\nFile:Side wall statues Yungang.jpg|[[Buddhist art]] of painted [[relief]] sculptures from the [[Yungang Grottoes]], [[Northern Wei Dynasty]] (386-535 AD)\nImage:Sun Quan Tang.jpg|Emperor [[Sun Quan]] in the ''Thirteen Emperors Scroll and Northern Qi Scholars Collating Classic Texts'', by [[Yan Liben]] (c. 600\u2013673 AD), Chinese\nImage:EightySevenCelestials3.jpg|Eighty-Seven Celestials, by [[Wu Daozi]] (685\u2013758), [[Tang dynasty]], Chinese\nImage:Hangan03.jpg|Portrait of ''Night-Shining White'', by [[Han Gan]], 8th century, [[Tang dynasty]], Chinese\nImage:Spring Outing of the Tang Court.jpg|''Spring Outing of the Tang Court'', by [[Zhang Xuan]], 8th century, [[Tang dynasty]], Chinese\nFile:Anonymous-Astana Graves Servant Girl2.jpg|''Servant'', 8th century, [[Tang dynasty]], Chinese\nImage:Meister nach Chang Hs\u00fcan 001.jpg|''Ladies making silk'', a remake of an 8th-century original by [[Zhang Xuan]] by [[Emperor Huizong of Song]], early 12th century, Chinese\nImage:E innga kyo.jpg|An illustrated sutra from the [[Nara period]], 8th century, Japanese\nImage:Chou Fang 001.jpg|''Ladies Playing Double Sixes'', by [[Zhou Fang (Tang dynasty)|Zhou Fang]] (730\u2013800 AD), [[Tang dynasty]], Chinese\nImage:A palace concert.jpg|''[[A Palace Concert]]'', [[Tang Dynasty]], Chinese\nImage:Xiao and Xiang rivers.jpg|''The Xiao and Xiang Rivers'', by [[Dong Yuan]] (c. 934\u2013962 AD), Chinese\nImage:Gu Hongzhong's Night Revels, Detail 1.jpg|''Night Revels'', a [[Song dynasty]] remake of a 10th-century original by [[Gu Hongzhong]].\nFile:Shenzong of Song.jpg|Court portrait of [[Emperor Shenzong of Song]] (r. 1067\u20131085), Chinese\nImage:Songhuizong4.jpg|''Golden Pheasant and Cotton Rose'', by [[Emperor Huizong of Song]] (r.1100\u20131126 AD), Chinese\nImage:Songhuizong8.jpg|''Listening to the Guqin'', by [[Emperor Huizong of Song]] (1100\u20131126 AD), Chinese\nImage:Su Han Ch'en 001.jpg|''Children Playing'', by Su Han Chen, c. 1150, Chinese\nImage:Chinesischer Maler des 12.

Far east traditional painting is characterized by water based techniques, less realism, \"elegant\" and stylized subjects, graphical approach to depiction, the importance of [[white space (visual arts)|white space]] (or [[negative space]]) and a preference for [[landscape]] (instead of the human figure) as a subject. Beyond ink and color on silk or paper scrolls, gold on [[lacquer]] was also a common medium in painted East Asian artwork. Although silk was a somewhat expensive medium to paint upon in the past, the invention of paper during the 1st century AD by the Han court eunuch [[Cai Lun]] provided not only a cheap and widespread medium for writing, but also a cheap and widespread medium for painting (making it more accessible to the public).\n\nThe ideologies of [[Confucianism]], [[Daoism]], and [[Buddhism]] played important roles in East Asian art.

They were often in simplistic stylized format and in more-or-less rudimentary geometric patterns. They often depicted mythological creatures, domestic scenes, labor scenes, or palatial scenes filled with officials at court. Artwork during this period and the subsequent [[Qin Dynasty]] (221 \u2013 207 BC) and [[Han Dynasty]] (202 BC \u2013 220 AD) was made not as a means in and of itself or for higher personal expression; rather artwork was created to symbolize and honor funerary rites, representations of mythological deities or spirits of ancestors, etc. Paintings on silk of court officials and domestic scenes could be found during the Han Dynasty, along with scenes of men hunting on horseback or partaking in military parade. There was also painting on three dimensional works of art like figurines and statues, such as the original-painted colors covering the soldier and horse statues of the [[Terracotta Army]]. During the social and cultural climate of the ancient [[Eastern Jin Dynasty]] (316 \u2013 420 AD) based at Nanjing in the south, painting became one of the official pastimes of [[Confucian]]-taught bureaucratic officials and [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrats]] (along with music played by the [[guqin]] zither, writing fanciful [[calligraphy]], and writing and reciting of poetry). Painting became a common form of artistic self-expression, and during this period painters at court or amongst elite social circuits were judged and ranked by their peers.\n\n[[Image:Zhang Shengwen. L'enseignement de Bouddha Sakyamuni.jpg|thumb|''The [[Gautama Buddha|Sakyamuni Buddha]]'', by [[Zhang Shengwen]], 1173\u20131176 AD, [[Song dynasty]] period.]]\nThe establishment of classical Chinese landscape painting is accredited largely to the [[Eastern Jin Dynasty]] artist [[Gu Kaizhi]] (344 \u2013 406 AD), one of the most famous artists of Chinese history. Like the elongated scroll scenes of Kaizhi, [[Tang dynasty]] (618 \u2013 907 AD) Chinese artists like [[Wu Daozi]] painted vivid and highly detailed artwork on long horizontal handscrolls (which were very popular during the Tang), such as his ''Eighty Seven Celestial People''. Painted artwork during the Tang period pertained the effects of an idealized landscape environment, with sparse amount of objects, persons, or activity, as well as monochromatic in nature (example: the murals of Price Yide's tomb in the Qianling Mausoleum). There were also figures such as early Tang-era painter [[Zhan Ziqian]], who painted superb landscape paintings that were well ahead of his day in portrayal of realism. However, landscape art did not reach greater level of maturity and realism in general until the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms]] period (907 \u2013 960 AD). During this time, there were exceptional landscape painters like [[Dong Yuan]] (refer to this article for an example of his artwork), and those who painted more vivid and realistic depictions of domestic scenes, like [[Gu Hongzhong]] and his ''Night Revels of Han Xizai''.\n[[Image:Loquats and Mountain Bird.jpg|thumb|left|''Loquats and Mountain Bird'', anonymous artist of the [[Southern Song dynasty]]; paintings in leaf album style such as this were popular in the Southern Song (1127\u20131279).]]\n\nDuring the Chinese [[Song dynasty]] (960 \u2013 1279 AD), not only landscape art was improved upon, but portrait painting became more standardized and sophisticated than before (for example, refer to [[Emperor Huizong of Song]]), and reached its classical age maturity during the [[Ming Dynasty]] (1368 \u2013 1644 AD). During the late 13th century and first half of the 14th century, Chinese under the [[Mongol]]-controlled [[Yuan Dynasty]] were not allowed to enter higher posts of government (reserved for Mongols or other ethnic groups from Central Asia), and the [[Imperial examination]] was ceased for the time being. Many Confucian-educated Chinese who now lacked profession turned to the arts of painting and theatre instead, as the Yuan period became one of the most vibrant and abundant eras for Chinese artwork. An example of such would be [[Qian Xuan]] (1235\u20131305 AD), who was an official of the Song dynasty, but out of patriotism, refused to serve the Yuan court and dedicated himself to painting. Examples of superb art from this period include the rich and detailed painted murals of the Yongle Palace ,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chinaculture.org/gb/en_artqa/2003-09/24/content_39769.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-03-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070405094841/http://www.chinaculture.org/gb/en_artqa/2003-09/24/content_39769.htm |archivedate=5 April 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcc.leidenuniv.nl/index.php3?m=245&c=55|title=Chinastudies - bacheloropleiding - Geesteswetenschappen - Humanities - Universiteit Leiden|website=www.tcc.leidenuniv.nl}}</ref> or \"Dachunyang Longevity Palace\", of 1262 AD, a [[UNESCO]] World Heritage site. Within the palace, paintings cover an area of more than 1000 square meters, and hold mostly Daoist themes. It was during the Song dynasty that painters would also gather in social clubs or meetings to discuss their art or others' artwork, the praising of which often led to persuasions to trade and sell precious works of art. However, there were also many harsh critics of others art as well, showing the difference in style and taste amongst different painters. In 1088 AD, the polymath scientist and statesman [[Shen Kuo]] once wrote of the artwork of one [[Li Cheng (painter)|Li Cheng]], who he criticized as follows:\n\n{{quote|\n...Then there was Li Cheng, who when he depicted [[pavilion]]s and lodges amidst mountains, storeyed buildings, [[pagoda]]s and the like, always used to paint the [[eave]]s as seen from below. His idea was that 'one should look upwards from underneath, just as a man standing on level ground and looking up at the eaves of a pagoda can see its rafters and its cantilever eave rafters'. This is all wrong. In general the proper way of painting a landscape is to see the small from the viewpoint of the large...just as one looks at artificial mountains in gardens (as one walks about). If one applies (Li's method) to the painting of real mountains, looking up at them from below, one can only see one profile at a time, and not the wealth of their multitudinous slopes and profiles, to say nothing of all that is going on in the valleys and [[canyon]]s, and in the lanes and [[courtyard]]s with their dwellings and houses. If we stand to the east of a mountain its western parts would be on the vanishing boundary of far-off distance, and vice versa. Surely this could not be called a successful painting? Mr. Li did not understand the principle of 'seeing the small from the viewpoint of the large'. He was certainly marvelous at diminishing accurately heights and distances, but should one attach such importance to the angles and corners of buildings?<ref>Needham, Joseph (1986).

Later Ming Dynasty artists would take after this Song dynasty emphasis for intricate detail and realism on objects in nature, especially in depictions of animals (such as ducks, swans, sparrows, tigers, etc.) amongst patches of brightly colored flowers and thickets of brush and wood (a good example would be the anonymous Ming Dynasty painting ''Birds and Plum Blossoms'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asia.si.edu/collections/zoomObject.cfm?ObjectId=4693|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704090030/http://www.asia.si.edu/collections/zoomObject.cfm?ObjectId=4693|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2007-07-04|title=Request Rejected|website=www.asia.si.edu}}</ref> housed in the Freer Gallery of the Smithsonian Museum in Washington, D.C.). There were many renowned Ming Dynasty artists; [[Qiu Ying]] is an excellent example of a paramount Ming era painter (famous even in his own day), utilizing in his artwork domestic scenes, bustling palatial scenes, and nature scenes of river valleys and steeped mountains shrouded in mist and swirling clouds. During the Ming Dynasty there were also different and rivaling schools of art associated with painting, such as the [[Wu School]] and the [[Zhe school (painting)|Zhe School]].\n\nClassical Chinese painting continued on into the early modern [[Qing Dynasty]], with highly realistic portrait paintings like seen in the late Ming Dynasty of the early 17th century. The portraits of [[Kangxi Emperor]], [[Yongzheng Emperor]], and [[Qianlong Emperor]] are excellent examples of realistic Chinese portrait painting. During the Qianlong reign period and the continuing 19th century, European [[Baroque]] styles of painting had noticeable influence on Chinese portrait paintings, especially with painted visual effects of lighting and shading. Likewise, East Asian paintings and other works of art (such as [[porcelain]] and lacquerware) were highly prized in Europe since initial contact in the 16th century.\n\n[[Image:Geiami - Viewing a Waterfall.jpeg|thumb|[[Muromachi period]], [[Shingei]] (1431\u20131485), ''Viewing a Waterfall'', Nezu Museum, Tokyo.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nezu-muse.or.jp/syuuzou/kaiga/10169.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-06-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927105016/http://www.nezu-muse.or.jp/syuuzou/kaiga/10169.html |archivedate=27 September 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>]]\n\n====Japanese ====\n{{main|Japanese painting|Japonism}}\n\nJapanese painting (\u7d75\u753b) is one of the oldest and most highly refined of the Japanese arts, encompassing a wide variety of genres and styles. As with Japanese arts in general, Japanese painting developed through a long history of synthesis and competition between native Japanese [[aesthetics]] and adaptation of imported ideas. [[Ukiyo-e]], or \"pictures of the floating world,\" is a genre of Japanese [[woodblock printing|woodblock prints]] (or \"[[woodcut]]s\") and paintings produced between the 17th and 20th centuries, featuring motifs of landscapes, theater, and courtesan districts. It is the main artistic genre of [[woodblock printing in Japan|Japanese woodblock printing]]. Japanese printmaking, especially from the [[Edo period]], exerted enormous influence on [[French painting]] over the 19th century.\n\n====Korean ====\n{{main|Korean painting}}\n\nKorean painting, as an independent form, began around 108 B.C., around the fall of [[Gojoseon]], making it one of the oldest in the world. The artwork of that time period evolved into the various styles that characterized the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]] period, most notably the paintings and frescoes that adorn the tombs of [[Goguryeo]]'s royalty. During the Three Kingdoms period and through the [[Goryeo dynasty]], Korean painting was characterized primarily by a combination of Korean-style landscapes, facial features, Buddhist-centered themes, and an emphasis on celestial observation that was facilitated by the rapid development of Korean astronomy. It wasn't until the [[Joseon dynasty]] that Confucian themes began to take root in Korean paintings, used in harmony with indigenous aspects.\n\nThe history of Korean painting has been characterized by the use monochromatic works of black brushwork, often on mulberry paper or silk. This style is evident in \"Min-Hwa\", or colorful folk art, tomb paintings, and ritual and festival arts, both of which incorporated an extensive use of colour.\n\n===South Asian===\n<gallery widths=\"140px\" heights=\"140px\" perrow=\"4\">\nImage:S\u00fcdindischer Meister um 1540 001.jpg|A group of women from South India, Hindupur, c. 1540.\nImage:Meister des G\u00eet\u00e2-Govinda-Manuskripts 001.jpg|''[[Krsna|Krishna]] embraces Gop\u00ees'', G\u00eet\u00e2-Govinda-manuscript, 1760\u20131765.\nImage:Indischer Maler um 850 001.jpg|''Floating Figures Dancing'', a mural of c. 850.\nImage:S\u00fcdindischer Meister um 1540 002.jpg|''Wild Pig Hunt'', c. 1540.\nImage:ChandBibiHawking.png|''Chand Bibi hawking'', Deccan style, 18th century\nImage:Indischer Maler um 1750 (III) 001.jpg|A Lady Listening to Music, c. 1750.\nImage:Indischer Maler von 1720 001.jpg|Rasama\u00f1jar\u00ee manuscript of the Bh\u00e2nudatta (erotic treatise), 1720.\nImage:Radha and Krishna in Discussion.jpg|Bahsoli painting of Radha and Krishna in Discussion, c. 1730.\nImage:Maharaja Sital Dev of Mankot in Devotion.jpg|Bahsoli painting of Maharaja Sital Dev of Mankot in Devotion, c. 1690.\nImage:Indischer Maler um 1615 (I) 001.jpg|Portrait of [[Ibrahim Adil Shah II]] (1580\u20131626) of [[Bijapur Sultanate|Bijapur]], 1615.\nImage:Meister des Nuj\u00fbm-al-'Ul\u00fbm-Manuskripts 001.jpg|''The Throne of the Wealth'', Nuj\u00fbm-al-' Ul\u00fbm-manuscript, 1570.\nImage:Elefant und Jungtier aus dem Stall der Moghulkaiser.jpg|Elephant and cub out of the stable of the [[Moghul]] ruler, 17th century.\nImage:Meister der Hamza-N\u00e2ma-Handschrift 001.jpg|''Mihrdukht Shoots an Arrow Through a Ring'', 1564\u20131579.\nImage:Meister des Portr\u00e4ts des Govardh\u00e2n Chand 001.jpg|Portrait of the Govardh\u00e2n Chand, [[Punjab region|Punjab]] style, c. 1750.\nImage:Ravi Varma-Ravana Sita Jathayu.jpg|Ravana kills Jathayu; the captive Sita despairs, by [[Raja Ravi Varma]]\nImage:Akbar and Tansen visit Haridas.jpg|''Akbar and Tansen Visit Haridas in Vrindavan'', [[Rajasthan]] style, c. 1750.\nImage:Indischer Maler um 1760 001.jpg|A man with children, [[Punjab region|Punjab]] style, 1760.\nImage:Indischer Maler um 1770 001.jpg|''R\u00e2dh\u00e2 arrests Krishna'', [[Punjab region|Punjab]] style, 1770.\nImage:Indischer Maler von 1780 001.jpg|''Rama and Sita in the Forest'', [[Punjab region|Punjab]] style, 1780.\n</gallery>\n\n===Indian ===\n{{main|Indian painting|Mughal painting}}\nIndian paintings historically revolved around the religious deities and kings. Indian art is a collective term for several different schools of art that existed in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. The paintings varied from large frescoes of [[Ajanta Caves|Ajanta]] to the intricate [[Mughal painting|Mughal]] miniature paintings to the metal embellished works from the [[Tanjore]] school. The paintings from the [[Gandhar(city/kingdom)|Gandhar]]\u2013[[Taxila]] are influenced by the [[Persian art|Persian]] works in the west. The eastern style of painting was mostly developed around the [[Nalanda]] school of art. The works are mostly inspired by various scenes from [[Hindu mythology|Indian mythology]].\n\n====History====\n[[Image:Bhimbetka.JPG|thumb|[[Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka]], [[rock painting]], [[Stone Age]], India]]\n\nThe earliest Indian paintings were the rock paintings of [[prehistory|prehistoric]] times, the [[petroglyph]]s as found in places like the [[Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka]], and some of them are older than 5500 BC. Such works continued and after several millennia, in the 7th century, carved pillars of [[Ajanta Caves|Ajanta]], Maharashtra state present a fine example of Indian paintings, and the colors, mostly various shades of red and orange, were derived from minerals.\n\n[[Ajanta Caves]] in Maharashtra, India are [[Rock cut architecture|rock-cut]] cave monuments dating back to the 2nd century [[BCE]] and containing paintings and sculpture considered to be masterpieces of both Buddhist religious art<ref>UNESCO World Heritage Site.

The origins of Madhubani painting are shrouded in antiquity.\n[[Image:Durga Mahisasuramardini.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Mother Goddess]] A miniature painting of the [[Pahari people|Pahari]] style, dating to the eighteenth century. Pahari and Rajput miniatures share many common features.]]\n\n=====Rajput =====\n[[Rajput painting]], a style of [[Indian painting]], evolved and flourished, during the 18th century, in the royal courts of [[Rajputana]], India. Each Rajput kingdom evolved a distinct style, but with certain common features. Rajput paintings depict a number of themes, events of epics like the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, Krishna's life, beautiful landscapes, and humans. Miniatures were the preferred medium of Rajput painting, but several manuscripts also contain Rajput paintings, and paintings were even done on the walls of palaces, inner chambers of the forts, havelies, particularly, the havelis of Shekhawait.\n\nThe colors extracted from certain minerals, plant sources, conch shells, and were even derived by processing precious stones, gold and silver were used. The preparation of desired colors was a lengthy process, sometimes taking weeks. Brushes used were very fine.\n\n=====Mughal =====\n[[File:Two Scribes Seated with Books and a Writing Table Fragment of a decorative margin Northern India.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|left|Two Scribes Seated with Books and a Writing Table Fragment of a decorative margin Northern India (Mughal school), ca. 1640\u20131650]]\n[[Mughal painting]] is a particular style of [[Indian painting]], generally confined to illustrations on the book and done in miniatures, and which emerged, developed and took shape during the period of the [[Mughal Empire]] 16th \u221219th centuries.\n\n=====Tanjore =====\n[[Tanjore painting]] is an important form of classical [[South India]]n painting native to the town of [[Tanjore]] in Tamil Nadu. The art form dates back to the early 9th century, a period dominated by the [[Chola dynasty|Chola]] rulers, who encouraged art and literature. These paintings are known for their elegance, rich colors, and attention to detail. The themes for most of these paintings are [[Hindu]] Gods and Goddesses and scenes from [[Hindu mythology]]. In modern times, these paintings have become a much sought after souvenir during festive occasions in South India.\n\nThe process of making a Tanjore painting involves many stages. The first stage involves the making of the preliminary sketch of the image on the base. The base consists of a cloth pasted over a wooden base. Then chalk powder or [[zinc oxide]] is mixed with water-soluble [[adhesive]] and applied on the base. To make the base smoother, a mild [[abrasive]] is sometimes used. After the drawing is made, decoration of the jewellery and the apparels in the image is done with semi-precious stones. Laces or threads are also used to decorate the jewellery. On top of this, the gold foils are pasted. Finally, [[dyes]] are used to add colors to the figures in the paintings.\n\n=====Madras School=====\nDuring British rule in India, the crown found that Madras had some of the most talented and intellectual artistic minds in the world. As the British had also established a huge settlement in and around Madras, Georgetown was chosen to establish an institute that would cater to the artistic expectations of the royal family in London. This has come to be known as the [[Madras School]]. At first traditional artists were employed to produce exquisite varieties of furniture, metal work, and curios and their work was sent to the royal palaces of the Queen.\n\nUnlike the Bengal School where 'copying' is the norm of teaching, the Madras School flourishes on 'creating' new styles, arguments and trends.\n\n=====Bengal School=====\n{{main|Bengal school of art}}\n\n[[File:Bharat Mata.jpg|right|thumb|''Bharat Mata'' by [[Abanindranath Tagore]] (1871\u20131951), a nephew of the poet [[Rabindranath Tagore]], and a pioneer of the movement]]\nThe [[Bengal school of art]] was an influential style of art that flourished in [[British India|India]] during the [[British Raj]] in the early 20th century. It was associated with Indian nationalism, but was also promoted and supported by many British arts administrators.\n\nThe Bengal School arose as an [[avant garde]] and nationalist movement reacting against the [[academic art]] styles previously promoted in India, both by [[Indian artist]]s such as [[Raja Ravi Varma]] and in British art schools. Following the widespread influence of Indian spiritual ideas in the West, the British art teacher [[Ernest Binfield Havel]] attempted to reform the teaching methods at the [[Calcutta School of Art]] by encouraging students to imitate [[Mughal painting|Mughal]] miniatures. This caused immense controversy, leading to a strike by students and complaints from the local press, including from nationalists who considered it to be a retrogressive move. Havel was supported by the artist [[Abanindranath Tagore]], a nephew of the poet [[Rabindranath Tagore]]. Tagore painted a number of works influenced by Mughal art, a style that he and Havel believed to be expressive of India's distinct spiritual qualities, as opposed to the \"materialism\" of the West. Tagore's best-known painting, ''Bharat Mata'' (Mother India), depicted a young woman, portrayed with four arms in the manner of Hindu deities, holding objects symbolic of India's national aspirations. Tagore later attempted to develop links with Japanese artists as part of an aspiration to construct a [[pan-Asianist]] model of art.\n\nThe Bengal School's influence in India declined with the spread of [[modernist]] ideas in the 1920s. In the post-independence period, Indian artists showed more adaptability as they borrowed freely from european styles and amalgamated them freely with the Indian motifs to new forms of art. While artists like [[Francis Newton Souza]] and [[Tyeb Mehta]] were more western in their approach, there were others like [[Ganesh Pyne]] and [[Maqbool Fida Husain]] who developed thoroughly indigenous styles of work. Today after the process of liberalization of market in India, the artists are experiencing more exposure to the international art-scene which is helping them in emerging with newer forms of art which were hitherto not seen in India. [[Jitish Kallat]] had shot to fame in the late 1990s with his paintings which were both modern and beyond the scope of generic definition. However, while artists in India in the new century are trying out new styles, themes and metaphors, it would not have been possible to get such quick recognition without the aid of the business houses which are now entering the art field like they had never before.\n\n=====Modern Indian =====\n{{main|Modern Indian painting}}\n[[Amrita Sher-Gil]] was an Indian painter, sometimes known as India's [[Frida Kahlo]],<ref name=\"AmritaMaps\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mapsofindia.com/who-is-who/art-culture/amrita-sher-gill.html |title=Amrita Sher-Gill |publisher= mapsofindia.com}}</ref> and today considered an important woman painter of 20th-century India, whose legacy stands at par with that of the Masters of [[Bengal Renaissance]];<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/res/web/pIe/ie/daily/19991017/iex17018.html |title=First Lady of the Modern Canvas |publisher=[[Indian Express]] |date=17 October 1999 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110305222544/http://www.indianexpress.com/res/web/pIe/ie/daily/19991017/iex17018.html |archivedate=5 March 2011 |df= }}</ref><ref name=\"Indiawomenpainters\">{{cite web|url=http://www.21stcenturyindianart.com/women.htm |title=Women painters |publisher=21stcenturyindianart.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071220174924/http://www.21stcenturyindianart.com/women.htm |archivedate=20 December 2007 |df= }}</ref> she is also the 'most expensive' woman painter of India.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://us.rediff.com/money/2007/dec/29art.htm |title=Most expensive Indian artists |publisher=us.rediff.com }}</ref>\n\nToday, she is amongst ''Nine Masters'', whose work was declared as ''art treasures'' by The [[Archaeological Survey of India]], in 1976 and 1979,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chdmuseum.nic.in/art_gallery/nine_masters.html |title=Nine Masters |publisher=[[Government Museum and Art Gallery, Chandigarh]] Official website |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204055532/http://chdmuseum.nic.in/art_gallery/nine_masters.html |archivedate=4 December 2010 |df= }}</ref> and over 100 of her paintings are now displayed at [[National Gallery of Modern Art]], New Delhi.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ngmaindia.gov.in/sh-amrita.asp |title= Showcase: Amrita Sher-Gil |publisher=National Gallery of Modern Art}}</ref>\n\nDuring the colonial era, Western influences started to make an impact on Indian art. Some artists developed a style that used Western ideas of composition, perspective and realism to illustrate Indian themes. Others, like [[Jamini Roy]], consciously drew inspiration from folk art.\n\nBy the time of Independence in 1947, several schools of art in India provided access to modern techniques and ideas. Galleries were established to showcase these artists. Modern Indian art typically shows the influence of Western styles, but is often inspired by Indian themes and images. Major artists are beginning to gain international recognition, initially among the Indian diaspora, but also among non-Indian audiences.\n\nThe [[Progressive Artists' Group]], established shortly after India became independent in 1947, was intended to establish new ways of expressing India in the post-colonial era. The founders were six eminent artists \u2013 [[K. H. Ara]], [[S. K. Bakre]], [[H. A. Gade]], [[M.F. Husain]], [[S.H. Raza]] and [[Francis Newton Souza|F. N. Souza]], though the group was dissolved in 1956, it was profoundly influential in changing the idiom of Indian art. Almost all India's major artists in the 1950s were associated with the group. Some of those who are well-known today are Bal Chabda, [[Manishi Dey]], [[Mukul Dey]], [[Vasudeo S. Gaitonde|V. S. Gaitonde]], [[Ram Kumar (artist)|Ram Kumar]], [[Tyeb Mehta]], and [[Akbar Padamsee]]. Other famous painters like [[Jahar Dasgupta]], Prokash Karmakar, [[John Wilkins (Indian artist)|John Wilkins]], Narayanan Ramachandran, and Bijon Choudhuri enriched the art culture of India. They have become the icons of modern Indian art. Art historians like Prof. Rai [[Anand Krishna]] have also referred to those works of modern artistes that reflect Indian ethos. Geeta Vadhera has had acclaim in translating complex, Indian spiritual themes onto canvas like Sufi thought, the Upanishads and the Bhagwad Geeta.\n\nIndian art got a boost with the economic liberalization of the country since the early 1990s. Artists from various fields now started bringing in varied styles of work. In post-liberalization India, many artists have established themselves in the international art market like the abstract painter [[Natvar Bhavsar]], figurative artist [[Devajyoti Ray]] and sculptor [[Anish Kapoor]] whose mammoth [[postminimalist]] artworks have acquired attention for their sheer size. Many art houses and galleries have also opened in USA and Europe to showcase Indian artworks.\n\n===Filipino ===\n{{Main|Arts of the Philippines}}\n{{See also|Women in Philippine art}}\n[[File:The Parisian Life by Juan Luna.jpg|thumb|[[Juan Luna]], ''[[The Parisian Life (painting)|The Parisian Life]]'', 1892]]\n[[File:Fabian de la Rosa, Women working in a rice field.jpg|thumb|[[Fabi\u00e1n de la Rosa]], ''Women Working in rice field'', 1902]]\n\nFilipino painting as a whole can be seen as an amalgamation of many cultural influences, though it tends to be more Western in its current form with Eastern roots.\n\nEarly Filipino painting can be found in red slip (clay mixed with water) designs embellished on the ritual pottery of the Philippines such as the acclaimed [[Manunggul Jar]]. Evidence of Philippine pottery-making dated as early as 6000{{nbsp}}BC has been found in Sanga-sanga Cave, Sulu and Laurente Cave, Cagayan. It has been proven that by 5000{{nbsp}}BC, the making of pottery was practiced throughout the country. Early Filipinos started making pottery before their Cambodian neighbors and at about the same time as the Thais as part of what appears to be a widespread Ice Age development of pottery technology. Further evidences of painting are manifested in the [[History of tattooing#Philippines|tattoo tradition]] of early Filipinos, whom the Portuguese explorer referred to as ''Pintados'' or the 'Painted People' of the Visayas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.admu.edu.ph/offices/mirlab/panublion/islas.html |title=Islas de los Pintados: The Visayan Islands |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927161432/http://www.admu.edu.ph/offices/mirlab/panublion/islas.html |archivedate=27 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Various designs referencing flora and fauna with heavenly bodies decorate their bodies in various colored pigmentation.

Early [[modern art|modernist]] painters such as [[Dami\u00e1n Domingo]] was associated with religious and secular paintings. The art of [[Juan Luna]] and [[F\u00e9lix Resurrecci\u00f3n Hidalgo|F\u00e9lix Hidalgo]] showed a trend for political statement.

Egyptian wall painting and decorative painting is often graphic, sometimes more symbolic than realistic. Egyptian painting depicts figures in bold outline and flat [[silhouette]], in which symmetry is a constant characteristic. [[Art of Ancient Egypt|Egyptian painting]] has close connection with its written language \u2013 called [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]]. Painted symbols are found amongst the first forms of written language. The Egyptians also painted on [[linen]], remnants of which survive today. Ancient Egyptian paintings survived due to the extremely dry climate. The ancient Egyptians created paintings to make the [[afterlife]] of the deceased a pleasant place. The themes included journey through the afterworld or their protective deities introducing the deceased to the gods of the underworld. Some examples of such paintings are paintings of the gods and goddesses [[Ra]], [[Horus]], [[Anubis]], [[Nut (goddess)|Nut]], [[Osiris]] and [[Isis]]. Some tomb paintings show activities that the deceased were involved in when they were alive and wished to carry on doing for eternity. In the [[New Kingdom]] and later, the [[Book of the Dead]] was buried with the entombed person.

The wall paintings found in the palace of [[Knossos]] are similar to that of the [[Egyptians]] but much more free in style. Around 1100{{nbsp}}BC, tribes from the north of Greece conquered Greece and the Greek art took a new direction.\n\n[[File:Hades and Persephone, Vergina.jpg|thumb|400px|A fresco showing [[Hades]] and [[Persephone]] riding in a [[chariot]], from the tomb of Queen [[Eurydice I of Macedon]] at [[Vergina]], Greece, 4th century BC]]\n[[Ancient Greece]] had skilled painters, sculptors (though both endeavours were regarded as mere manual labour at the time), and architects. The [[Parthenon]] is an example of their architecture that has lasted to modern days. Greek marble sculpture is often described as the highest form of [[classicism|Classical]] art. Painting on [[pottery of Ancient Greece]] and [[Ceramics (art)|ceramics]] gives a particularly informative glimpse into the way society in Ancient Greece functioned. [[Black-figure vase painting]] and [[Red-figure vase painting]] gives many surviving examples of what Greek painting was. Some famous Greek painters on wooden panels who are mentioned in texts are [[Apelles]], [[Zeuxis and Parrhasius]], however no examples of Ancient Greek panel painting survive, only written descriptions by their contemporaries or later Romans. Zeuxis lived in 5\u20136{{nbsp}}BC and was said to be the first to use [[sfumato]]. According to [[Pliny the Elder]], the realism of his paintings was such that birds tried to eat the painted grapes. Apelles is described as the greatest painter of [[classical antiquity|Antiquity]] for perfect technique in drawing, brilliant color and modeling.\n\n[[Roman art]] was influenced by Greece and can in part be taken as a descendant of ancient Greek painting. However, Roman painting does have important unique characteristics. The only surviving Roman paintings are wall paintings, many from villas in [[Campania]], in Southern Italy. Such painting can be grouped into 4 main \"styles\" or periods<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.art-and-archaeology.com/roman/painting.html |title=Roman Painting |publisher=art-and-archaeology.com}}</ref> and may contain the first examples of [[trompe-l'\u0153il]], pseudo-perspective, and pure landscape.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accd.edu/sac/vat/arthistory/arts1303/Rome4.htm |title=Roman Wall Painting |publisher=accd.edu |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070319123717/http://www.accd.edu/sac/vat/arthistory/arts1303/Rome4.htm |archivedate=19 March 2007 |df= }}</ref> Almost the only painted portraits surviving from the Ancient world are a large number of [[Fayum mummy portraits|coffin-portraits]] of bust form found in the [[Late Antique]] cemetery of [[Al-Fayum]].

[[Byzantine art]], once its style was established by the 6th century, placed great emphasis on retaining traditional [[iconography]] and style, and gradually evolved during the thousand years of the [[Byzantine Empire]] and the living traditions of Greek and Russian [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox]] [[icon]]-painting.  Byzantine painting has a hieratic feeling and icons were and still are seen as a representation of divine revelation.  There were many [[fresco]]s, but fewer of these have survived than [[mosaic]]s.\nByzantine art has been compared to contemporary [[abstraction]], in its flatness and highly stylised depictions of figures and landscape.  Some periods of Byzantine art, especially the so-called [[Macedonian art (Byzantine)|Macedonian art]] of around the 10th century, are more flexible in approach. Frescos of the Palaeologian Renaissance of the early 14th century survive in the [[Chora Church]] in Istanbul.\n[[Image:Hastings book of the hours.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Book of Hours]]]]\nIn post-Antique Catholic Europe the first distinctive artistic style to emerge that included painting was the [[Insular art]] of the British Isles, where the only surviving examples are miniatures in [[Illuminated manuscript]]s such as the [[Book of Kells]].<ref>Putnam A.M., Geo. Haven. Books and Their Makers During The Middle Ages. Vol. 1. New York: Hillary House, 1962. Print.</ref>  These are most famous for their abstract decoration, although figures, and sometimes scenes, were also depicted, especially in [[Evangelist portrait]]s. [[Carolingian art|Carolingian]] and [[Ottonian art]] also survives mostly in manuscripts, although some wall-painting remain, and more are documented.  The art of this period combines Insular and \"barbarian\" influences with a strong Byzantine influence and an aspiration to recover classical monumentality and poise.\n\nWalls of [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic art|Gothic]] churches were decorated with [[fresco]]es as well as sculpture and many of the few remaining [[mural]]s have great intensity, and combine the decorative energy of Insular art with a new monumentality in the treatment of figures. Far more miniatures in [[Illuminated manuscript]]s survive from the period, showing the same characteristics, which continue into the [[Gothic art|Gothic period]].\n\nPanel painting becomes more common during the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] period, under the heavy influence of Byzantine icons.  Towards the middle of the 13th century, [[Medieval art]] and [[Gothic painting]] became more realistic, with the beginnings of interest in the depiction of volume and perspective in Italy with [[Cimabue]] and then his pupil [[Giotto]].  From Giotto on, the treatment of composition by the best painters also became much more free and innovative.  They are considered to be the two great medieval masters of painting in western culture. Cimabue, within the Byzantine tradition, used a more realistic and dramatic approach to his art. His pupil, Giotto, took these innovations to a higher level which in turn set the foundations for the western painting tradition. Both artists were pioneers in the move towards naturalism.\n\nChurches were built with more and more windows and the use of colorful [[stained glass]] become a staple in decoration. One of the most famous examples of this is found in the cathedral of [[Notre Dame de Paris]]. By the 14th century Western societies were both richer and more cultivated and painters found new patrons in the nobility and even the [[bourgeoisie]]. Illuminated manuscripts took on a new character and slim, fashionably dressed court women were shown in their landscapes. This style soon became known as International style and [[tempera]] panel paintings and altarpieces gained importance.\n\n===Renaissance and Mannerism===\n{{Main|Renaissance painting|Early Netherlandish painting|Italian Renaissance painting|Mannerism|High Renaissance|}}\n<gallery widths=\"140px\" heights=\"140px\" perrow=\"4\">\nFile:Robert Campin - L' Annonciation - 1425.jpg|[[Robert Campin]], c. 1425\nFile:Van Eyck - Arnolfini Portrait.jpg|[[Jan van Eyck]], 1434\nFile:Weyden_Deposition.jpg|[[Rogier van der Weyden]], c. 1435\nFile:Hugo van der Goes - The Adoration of the Kings (Monforte Altar) - Google Art Project.jpg|[[Hugo van der Goes]], c.&nbsp;1470\nFile:Dieric_Bouts_-_The_Last_Supper_-_WGA03003.jpg|[[Dieric Bouts]], 1464\u20131467\nFile:Das_J\u00fcngste_Gericht_%28Memling%29.jpg|[[Hans Memling]], c.&nbsp;1466\u20131473\nFile:Petrus_Christus_-_Portrait_of_a_Young_Woman_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg|[[Petrus Christus]], c. 1470\nFile:The Garden of Earthly Delights by Bosch High Resolution.jpg|[[Hieronymus Bosch]], c.&nbsp;1480\u20131505\nFile:La Anunciaci\u00f3n, de Fra Angelico.jpg|[[Fra Angelico]], 1425\u20131428\nFile:Paolo Uccello 047b.jpg|[[Paolo Uccello]], c. 1470\nFile:Masaccio_expulsion-1427.jpg|[[Masaccio]], 1426\u20131427\nFile:Madonna and Child (Filippo Lippi).jpg|[[Filippo Lippi]], 1440\u20131445\nFile:Andrea Mantegna 036.jpg|[[Andrea Mantegna]], c. 1458\u20131460\nFile:Piero della Francesca - Resurrection - WGA17609.jpg|[[Piero della Francesca]], 1463\u20131465\nFile:Sandro Botticelli - La nascita di Venere - Google Art Project - edited.jpg|[[Sandro Botticelli]], 1483\u20131485\nFile:Mona Lisa, by Leonardo da Vinci, from C2RMF retouched.jpg|[[Leonardo da Vinci]], 1503\u20131506\nFile:Raphael - Madonna in the Meadow - Google Art Project.jpg|[[Raphael]], 1505\u20131506\nFile:Michelangelo - Creation of Adam.jpg|[[Michelangelo]], c. 1511\nFile:1530 Cranach Judith mit dem Haupt des Holofernes anagoria.JPG|[[Lucas Cranach the Elder]], c.&nbsp;1530\nFile:Albrecht D\u00fcrer - 1500 self-portrait (High resolution and detail).jpg|[[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]], 1500\nFile:Mathis_Gothart_Gr\u00fcnewald_030.jpg|[[Matthias Gr\u00fcnewald]], 1512\u20131516\nFile:Giovanni Bellini St Francis in Ecstasy.jpg|[[Giovanni Bellini]], c. 1480\nFile:Giorgione tempest.jpg|[[Giorgione]], c. 1505\nFile:Titian Bacchus and Ariadne.jpg|[[Titian]], 1520\u20131523\nFile:Jacopo Pontormo - Kreuzabnahme Christi.jpg|[[Pontormo]], 1526\u20131528\nFile:Angelo Bronzino - Venus, Cupid, Folly and Time - National Gallery, London.jpg|[[Bronzino]], 1540\u20131545\nFile:Pieter Bruegel the Elder- The Harvesters - Google Art Project.jpg|[[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel]], 1565\nFile:Hans Holbein, the Younger - Sir Thomas More - Google Art Project.jpg|[[Hans Holbein the Younger]], 1527\nFile:Jacopo Tintoretto - The Origin of the Milky Way - Google Art Project.jpg|[[Jacopo Tintoretto]], 1582\nFile:Paolo_Veronese_008.jpg|[[Paolo Veronese]], 1562\u20131563\nFile:1595 Wtewael Die Sintflut anagoria.JPG|[[Joachim Wtewael]], 1595\nFile:El Greco View of Toledo.jpg|[[El Greco]], 1596\u20131600\n</gallery>\nThe Renaissance (French for 'rebirth'), a cultural movement roughly spanning the 14th through the mid-17th century, heralded the study of classical sources, as well as advances in science which profoundly influenced European intellectual and artistic life. In the [[Low Countries]], especially in modern day [[Flanders]], a new way of painting was established in the beginning of the 15th century. In the footsteps of the developments made in the [[illuminated manuscript|illumination of manuscripts]], especially by the [[Limbourg Brothers]], artists became fascinated by the tangible in the visible world and began representing objects in an extremely naturalistic way.<ref name=\"Gardner et al\">Gardner, H., Kleiner, F. S., & Mamiya, C. J. (2006). Gardner's art through the ages: the Western perspective. Belmont, CA, Thomson Wadsworth: 430-437</ref> The adoption of [[oil painting]] whose invention was traditionally, but erroneously, credited to [[Jan van Eyck]], made possible a new [[verisimilitude]] in depicting this naturalism. The medium of oil paint was already present in the work of [[Melchior Broederlam]], but painters like Jan van Eyck and [[Robert Campin]] brought its use to new heights and employed it to represent the naturalism they were aiming for. With this new medium the painters of this period were capable of creating richer colors with a deep intense tonality. The illusion of glowing light with a porcelain-like finish characterized [[Early Netherlandish painting]] and was a major difference to the matte surface of [[tempera]] paint used in Italy.<ref name=\"Gardner et al\" /> Unlike the Italians, whose work drew heavily from the art of Ancient Greece and Rome, the northerners retained a stylistic residue of the sculpture and [[illuminated manuscripts]] of the Middle Ages (especially its naturalism). The most important artist of this time was [[Jan van Eyck]], whose work ranks among the finest made by artists who are now known as [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish painters]] or [[Flemish Primitives]] (since most artists were active in cities in modern day Flanders). The first painter of this period was [[the Master of Fl\u00e9malle]], nowadays identified as [[Robert Campin]], whose work follows the art of the [[International Gothic]]. Another important painter of this period was [[Rogier van der Weyden]], whose compositions stressed human emotion and drama, demonstrated for instance in his [[The Descent from the Cross (van der Weyden)|Descent from the Cross]], which ranks among the most famous works of the 15th century and was the most influential Netherlandish painting of Christ's crucifixion. Other important artists from this period are [[Hugo van der Goes]] (whose work was highly influential in Italy), [[Dieric Bouts]] (who was among the first northern painters to demonstrate the use of a single vanishing point),<ref name=\"Gardner et al\" /> [[Petrus Christus]], [[Hans Memling]] and [[Gerard David]].\n\nIn Italy, the art of [[Classical antiquity]] inspired a style of painting that emphasized the ideal. Artists such as [[Paolo Uccello]], [[Masaccio]], [[Fra Angelico]], [[Piero della Francesca]], [[Andrea Mantegna]], [[Filippo Lippi]], [[Sandro Botticelli]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Michelangelo Buonarroti]], and [[Raphael]] took painting to a higher level through the use of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], the study of [[human anatomy]] and proportion, and through their development of an unprecedented refinement in drawing and painting techniques. A somewhat more naturalistic style emerged in [[Venice]]. Painters of the [[Venetian school (art)|Venetian school]], such as [[Giovanni Bellini]], [[Giorgione]], [[Titian]], [[Tintoretto]], and [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]], were less concerned with precision in their drawing than with the richness of color and unity of effect that could be achieved by a more spontaneous approach to painting.\n\nFlemish, Dutch and German painters of the Renaissance such as [[Hans Holbein the Younger]], [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]], [[Lucas Cranach the Elder|Lucas Cranach]], [[Matthias Gr\u00fcnewald]], [[Hieronymous Bosch]], and [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel]] represent a different approach from their Italian colleagues, one that is more realistic and less idealized. [[Genre painting]] became a popular idiom amongst the Northern painters like [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel]].\n\nRenaissance painting reflects the revolution of ideas and science ([[astronomy]], [[geography]]) that occurred in this period, the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], and the invention of the [[printing press]]. D\u00fcrer, considered one of the greatest of printmakers, states that painters are not mere [[artisan]]s but [[Intellectual|thinkers]] as well. With the development of [[easel painting]] in the Renaissance, painting gained independence from architecture. Easel paintings\u2014movable pictures which could be hung easily on walls\u2014became a popular alternative to paintings fixed to furniture, walls or other structures. Following centuries dominated by religious imagery, secular subject matter slowly returned to Western painting. Artists included visions of the world around them, or the products of their own imaginations in their paintings. Those who could afford the expense could become patrons and commission portraits of themselves or their family.\n\nThe [[High Renaissance]] gave rise to a stylized art known as [[Mannerism]]. In place of the balanced compositions and rational approach to perspective that characterized art at the dawn of the 16th century, the Mannerists sought instability, artifice, and doubt. The unperturbed faces and gestures of [[Piero della Francesca]] and the calm Virgins of Raphael are replaced by the troubled expressions of [[Pontormo]] and the emotional intensity of [[El Greco]]. Restless and unstable compositions, often extreme or disjunctive effects of perspective, and stylized poses are characteristic of Italian Mannerists such as [[Tintoretto]], Pontormo, and [[Bronzino]], and appeared later in the work of [[Northern Mannerism|Northern Mannerists]] such as [[Hendrick Goltzius]], [[Bartholomeus Spranger]], and [[Joachim Wtewael]].\n\n===Baroque and Rococo===\n{{Main|Baroque|Baroque painting|Rococo|Quadratura|Dutch Golden Age painting|Flemish Baroque painting}}\n<gallery widths=\"140px\" heights=\"140px\" perrow=\"4\">\nFile:Caravaggio - Bacco adolescente - Google Art Project.jpg|[[Caravaggio]], 1595\u20131597\nFile:Artemisia Gentileschi - Giuditta decapita Oloferne - Google Art Project.jpg|[[Artemisia Gentileschi]], 1614\u20131620\nFile:Rubens_-_Judgement_of_Paris.jpg|[[Peter Paul Rubens]], 1632\u20131635\nFile:Cavalier_soldier_Hals-1624x.jpg|[[Frans Hals]], 1624\nFile:Judith_Leyster_A_Game_of_Tric_Trac.jpg|[[Judith Leyster]], 1630\nFile:The_Nightwatch_by_Rembrandt.jpg|[[Rembrandt|Rembrandt van Rijn]], 1642\nFile:Pieter_de_Hooch_-_The_Courtyard_of_a_House_in_Delft.jpg|[[Pieter de Hooch]], 1658\nFile:Johannes Vermeer - Het melkmeisje - Google Art Project.jpg|[[Johannes Vermeer]], c.&nbsp;1660\nFile:The_way_you_hear_it.jpg|[[Jan Steen]], c. 1665\nFile:The_Windmill_at_Wijk_bij_Duurstede_1670_Ruisdael.jpg|[[Jacob van Ruisdael]], 1670\nFile:Willem_Clasz._Heda_-_Breakfast_Table_with_Blackberry_Pie_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg|[[Willem Claesz.

Mamiya, \"Gardner's Art Through the Ages\" (Belmont, CA: Thomson/Wadsworth, 2005)</ref>\n\nBaroque painting is characterized by great drama, rich, deep color, and intense light and dark shadows. Baroque art was meant to evoke emotion and passion instead of the calm rationality that had been prized during the Renaissance. During the period beginning around 1600 and continuing throughout the 17th century, painting is characterized as Baroque. Among the greatest painters of the Baroque are [[Caravaggio]], [[Rembrandt]], [[Frans Hals]], [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez|Vel\u00e1zquez]], [[Nicolas Poussin|Poussin]], and [[Johannes Vermeer]]. Caravaggio is an heir of the [[Humanism|humanist]] painting of the [[High Renaissance]]. His [[realism (visual arts)|realistic]] approach to the human figure, painted directly from life and dramatically spotlit against a dark background, shocked his contemporaries and opened a new chapter in the history of painting.\nBaroque painting often dramatizes scenes using light effects; this can be seen in works by Rembrandt, Vermeer, [[Le Nain]], [[Georges de La Tour|La Tour]], and [[Jusepe de Ribera]].\n\n[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn - Portret van een paar als oudtestamentische figuren, genaamd 'Het Joodse bruidje' - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Rembrandt|Rembrandt van Rijn]], ''The Jewish Bride'', ca.&nbsp;1665\u20131669]]\nIn Italy, the Baroque style is epitomized by religious and mythological paintings in the [[Grand Manner]] by artists such as [[the Carracci]], [[Guido Reni]], and [[Luca Giordano]]. Illusionistic church ceiling frescoes by [[Pietro da Cortona]] seemed to open to the sky. A much quieter type of Baroque emerged in the [[Dutch Republic]], where easel paintings of everyday subjects were popular with middle-class collectors, and many painters became specialists in [[genre painting|genre]], others in landscape or seascape or still life. Vermeer, [[Gerard ter Borch]], and [[Pieter de Hooch]] brought great technical refinement to the painting of domestic scenes, as did [[Willem Claesz. Heda]] to still life. In contrast, Rembrandt excelled in painting every type of subject, and developed an individual [[painterliness|painterly]] style in which the chiaroscuro and dark backgrounds derived from Caravaggio and the [[Utrecht Caravaggists]] lose their theatrical quality.\n\nDuring the 18th century, [[Rococo]] followed as a lighter extension of Baroque, often frivolous and erotic. Rococo developed first in the decorative arts and interior design in France. [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]]'s succession brought a change in the court artists and general artistic fashion.  The 1730s represented the height of Rococo development in France exemplified by the works of [[Antoine Watteau]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Boucher]].  Rococo still maintained the Baroque taste for complex forms and intricate patterns, but by this point, it had begun to integrate a variety of diverse characteristics, including a taste for Oriental designs and asymmetric compositions.\n\nThe Rococo style spread with French artists and engraved publications.  It was readily received in the Catholic parts of Germany, [[Bohemia]], and [[Austria]], where it was merged with the lively German Baroque traditions.  German Rococo was applied with enthusiasm to churches and palaces, particularly in the south, while [[Frederician Rococo]] developed in the [[Kingdom of Prussia]].\n\nThe French masters [[Jean-Antoine Watteau|Watteau]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Boucher|Boucher]] and [[Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard|Fragonard]] represent the style, as do [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]] and [[Jean-Baptiste-Sim\u00e9on Chardin]] who was considered by some as the best French painter of the 18th century \u2013 the ''Anti-Rococo''. [[Portrait]]ure was an important component of painting in all countries, but especially in England, where the leaders were [[William Hogarth]], in a blunt realist style, and [[Francis Hayman]], [[Angelica Kauffman]] (who was Swiss), [[Thomas Gainsborough]] and [[Joshua Reynolds]] in more flattering styles influenced by [[Anthony van Dyck]]. In France during the Rococo era [[Jean-Baptiste Greuze]] (the favorite painter of [[Denis Diderot]]),<ref>[[Edmond de Goncourt|Edmond]] and [[Jules de Goncourt]], ''French Eighteenth-Century Painters.'' Cornell Paperbacks, 1981, pp. 222\u2013225. {{ISBN|0-8014-9218-1}}</ref> excelled in portraits and [[history painting]]s, and [[Maurice Quentin de La Tour]] and [[\u00c9lisabeth Vig\u00e9e-Lebrun]] were highly accomplished [[Portrait painting|portrait painters]]. La Tour specialized in [[pastel]] painting, which became a popular medium during this period.\n\n[[William Hogarth]] helped develop a theoretical foundation for Rococo beauty. Though not intentionally referencing the movement, he argued in his ''Analysis of Beauty'' (1753) that the undulating lines and S-curves prominent in Rococo were the basis for grace and beauty in art or nature (unlike the straight line or the circle in [[Classicism]]). The beginning of the end for Rococo came in the early 1760s as figures like [[Voltaire]] and [[Jacques-Fran\u00e7ois Blondel]] began to voice their criticism of the superficiality and degeneracy of the art.  Blondel decried the \"ridiculous jumble of shells, dragons, reeds, palm-trees and plants\" in contemporary interiors.<ref>[http://digi.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/sammlung6/allg/buch.xml?docname=blondel1737 Uni-Heidelberg.de]{{dead link|date=August 2014}}</ref>\n\nBy 1785, Rococo had passed out of fashion in France, replaced by the order and seriousness of [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] artists like [[Jacques-Louis David]].\n\n===19th century: Neo-classicism, History painting, Romanticism, Impressionism, Post-Impressionism, Symbolism===\n{{Main|Neoclassicism|History painting|Romanticism|Impressionism|Post-Impressionism|Symbolism (arts)}}\n<gallery widths=\"140px\" heights=\"140px\" perrow=\"4\">\nImage:David_-_The_Death_of_Socrates.jpg|[[Jacques-Louis David]] 1787\nImage:Watsonandtheshark-original.jpg|[[John Singleton Copley]] 1778\nImage:Constable DeadhamVale.jpg|[[John Constable]] 1802\nImage:Antoine-Jean Gros - Bonaparte visitant les pestif\u00e9r\u00e9s de Jaffa.jpg|[[Antoine-Jean Gros]], 1804\nImage:Jean-Auguste-Dominique_Ingres_-_Oedipus_and_the_Sphinx_-_Walters_379.jpg|[[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres]] 1814\nFile:El Tres de Mayo, by Francisco de Goya, from Prado thin black margin.jpg|[[Francisco de Goya]] 1814\nImage:Jean Louis Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault 002.jpg|[[Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault]] 1819\nImage:Caspar_David_Friedrich_-_Mondaufgang_am_Meer_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg|[[Caspar David Friedrich]] c.1822\nImage:Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix - La libert\u00e9 guidant le peuple.jpg|[[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix]] 1830\nImage:The Fighting Temeraire, JMW Turner, National Gallery.jpg|[[J.

Ingres' work already contains much of the sensuality, but none of the spontaneity, that was to characterize [[Romanticism]].\nThis movement turned its attention toward landscape and nature as well as the human figure and the supremacy of natural order above mankind's will. There is a [[pantheism|pantheist]] philosophy (see [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]) within this conception that opposes [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideals by seeing mankind's destiny in a more tragic or pessimistic light. The idea that human beings are not above the forces of [[Nature]] is in contradiction to [[Ancient Greek]] and Renaissance ideals where mankind was above all things and owned his fate. This thinking led romantic artists to depict the [[Sublimation (psychology)|sublime]], ruined churches, shipwrecks, massacres and madness.\n\nBy the mid-19th-century painters became liberated from the demands of their patronage to only depict scenes from religion, mythology, portraiture or history. The idea \"art for art's sake\" began to find expression in the work of painters like Francisco de Goya, John Constable, and J.M.W. Turner. Romantic painters saw [[landscape painting]] as an important genre to express the vanity of mankind in opposition to the grandeur of nature. Until then, landscape painting wasn't considered the most important genre for painters (like portraiture or history painting). But painters like J.M.W. Turner and Caspar David Friedrich managed to elevate landscape painting to an eminence rivalling history painting.\nSome of the major painters of this period are [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix]], [[Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault]], [[J. M. W. Turner]], [[Caspar David Friedrich]] and [[John Constable]]. [[Francisco de Goya]]'s late work demonstrates the Romantic interest in the irrational, while the work of [[Arnold B\u00f6cklin]] evokes mystery and the paintings of [[Aesthetic movement]] artist [[James McNeill Whistler]] evoke both sophistication and [[decadent movement|decadence]]. In the United States the Romantic tradition of landscape painting was known as the [[Hudson River School]]:<ref>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0268/is_5_40/ai_82469521 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120708024742/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0268/is_5_40/ai_82469521 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=8 July 2012 |last=Novack |first=Barbara |title=American Sublime Artforum |year=2002 |accessdate=30 October 2008 |work=ArtForum }}</ref> exponents include [[Thomas Cole]], [[Frederic Edwin Church]], [[Albert Bierstadt]], [[Thomas Moran]], and [[John Frederick Kensett]]. [[Luminism (American art style)|Luminism]] was a movement in American landscape painting related to the [[Hudson River School]].\n\n[[Image:Mary Cassatt Young Mother Sewing.jpg|thumb|left|''Young Mother Sewing'', [[Mary Cassatt]]]]The leading [[Barbizon School]] painter [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot|Camille Corot]] painted in both a romantic and a [[Realism (visual arts)|realistic]] vein; his work prefigures [[Impressionism]], as does the paintings of [[Eug\u00e8ne Boudin]] who was one of the first French landscape painters to paint outdoors. Boudin was also an important influence on the young [[Claude Monet]], whom in 1857 he introduced to [[Plein air]] painting. A major force in the turn towards [[Realism (visual arts)|Realism]] at mid-century was [[Gustave Courbet]]. In the latter third of the century Impressionists like [[\u00c9douard Manet]], [[Claude Monet]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Camille Pissarro]], [[Alfred Sisley]], [[Berthe Morisot]], [[Mary Cassatt]], and [[Edgar Degas]] worked in a more direct approach than had previously been exhibited publicly. They eschewed allegory and narrative in favor of individualized responses to the modern world, sometimes painted with little or no preparatory study, relying on deftness of drawing and a highly chromatic pallette. Manet, Degas, Renoir, Morisot, and Cassatt concentrated primarily on the human subject. Both Manet and Degas reinterpreted classical figurative canons within contemporary situations; in Manet's case the re-imaginings met with hostile public reception. Renoir, Morisot, and Cassatt turned to domestic life for inspiration, with Renoir focusing on the female nude. Monet, Pissarro, and Sisley used the landscape as their primary motif, the transience of light and weather playing a major role in their work. While Sisley most closely adhered to the original principals of the Impressionist perception of the landscape, Monet sought challenges in increasingly chromatic and changeable conditions, culminating in his series of monumental works of [[Water Lilies]] painted in [[Giverny]].\n[[Image:The Scream.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Edvard Munch]], 1893, early example of [[Expressionism]]]]\nPissarro adopted some of the experiments of [[Post-Impressionism]]. Slightly younger Post-Impressionists like [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Paul Gauguin]], and [[Georges Seurat]], along with [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]] led art to the edge of [[modernism]]; for Gauguin Impressionism gave way to a personal symbolism; Seurat transformed Impressionism's broken color into a scientific optical study, structured on frieze-like\ncompositions; Van Gogh's turbulent method of paint application, coupled with a sonorous use of color, predicted [[Expressionism]] and [[Fauvism]], and C\u00e9zanne, desiring to unite classical composition with a revolutionary abstraction of natural forms, would come to be seen as a precursor of 20th-century art.\nThe spell of Impressionism was felt throughout the world, including in the United States, where it became integral to the painting of [[American Impressionists]] such as [[Childe Hassam]], [[John Twachtman]], and [[Theodore Robinson]]; and in Australia where painters of the [[Heidelberg School]] such as [[Arthur Streeton]], [[Frederick McCubbin]] and [[Charles Conder]] painted ''[[en plein air]]'' and were particularly interested in the Australian landscape and light. It also exerted influence on painters who were not primarily Impressionistic in theory, like the portrait and landscape painter [[John Singer Sargent]]. At the same time in America at the turn of the 20th century there existed a native and nearly insular realism, as richly embodied in the figurative work of [[Thomas Eakins]], the [[Ashcan School]], and the landscapes and seascapes of [[Winslow Homer]], all of whose paintings were deeply invested in the solidity of natural forms. The visionary landscape, a motive largely dependent on the ambiguity of the nocturne, found its advocates in [[Albert Pinkham Ryder]] and [[Ralph Albert Blakelock]].\n\nIn the late 19th century there also were several, rather dissimilar, groups of [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist painters]] whose works resonated with younger artists of the 20th century, especially with the [[Fauvism|Fauvists]] and the [[Surrealism|Surrealists]]. Among them were [[Gustave Moreau]], [[Odilon Redon]], [[Pierre Puvis de Chavannes]], [[Henri Fantin-Latour]], [[Arnold B\u00f6cklin]], [[Edvard Munch]], [[F\u00e9licien Rops]], and [[Jan Toorop]], and [[Gustave Klimt]] amongst others including the [[Russian Symbolism|Russian Symbolists]] like [[Mikhail Vrubel]].\n\n[[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist painters]] mined [[mythology]] and dream imagery for a visual language of the soul, seeking evocative paintings that brought to mind a static world of silence. The symbols used in Symbolism are not the familiar [[emblems]] of mainstream [[iconography]] but intensely personal, private, obscure and ambiguous references. More a philosophy than an actual style of art, the Symbolist painters influenced the contemporary [[Art Nouveau]] movement and [[Les Nabis]]. In their exploration of dreamlike subjects, symbolist painters are found across centuries and cultures, as they are still today; [[Bernard Delvaille]] has described [[Ren\u00e9 Magritte]]'s surrealism as \"Symbolism plus [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]\".<ref>{{cite book| last = Delvaille| first = Bernard|authorlink=Bernard Delvaille| title = La po\u00e9sie symboliste: [anthologie]| year = 1971| isbn = 978-2-221-50161-0 }}</ref>\n\n===20th-century modern and contemporary===\n{{main|Modern Art|Modernism|Contemporary art}}\nThe heritage of painters like [[Van Gogh]], [[C\u00e9zanne]], [[Gauguin]], and [[Seurat]] was essential for the development of modern art. At the beginning of the 20th century [[Henri Matisse]] and several other young artists revolutionized the Paris art world with \"wild\", multi-colored, expressive, landscapes and figure paintings that the critics called [[Fauvism]].

At the beginning of the 20th century [[Henri Matisse]] and several other young artists including the pre-cubist [[Georges Braque]], [[Andr\u00e9 Derain]], [[Raoul Dufy]] and [[Maurice de Vlaminck]] revolutionized the Paris art world with \"wild\", multi-colored, expressive, landscapes and figure paintings that the critics called [[Fauvism]]. [[Henri Matisse]]'s second version of ''[[The Dance (painting)|The Dance]]'' signifies a key point in his career and in the development of modern painting.<ref>Russell T. Clement. ''Four French Symbolists''. Greenwood Press, 1996. Page 114.</ref> It reflects Matisse's incipient fascination with [[primitive art]]: the intense warm colors against the cool blue-green background and the rhythmical succession of dancing nudes convey the feelings of emotional liberation and [[hedonism]]. [[Pablo Picasso]] made his first [[Cubism|cubist]] paintings based on C\u00e9zanne's idea that all depiction of nature can be reduced to three solids: [[cube]], [[sphere]] and [[cone (geometry)|cone]]. With the painting [[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]] 1907, Picasso dramatically created a new and radical picture depicting a raw and primitive brothel scene with five prostitutes, violently painted women, reminiscent of [[African tribal masks]] and his own new [[Cubist]] inventions. [[analytic Cubism]] was jointly developed by Pablo Picasso and [[Georges Braque]], exemplified by ''Violin and Candlestick, Paris'', from about 1908 through 1912. Analytic cubism, the first clear manifestation of cubism, was followed by [[synthetic cubism]], practised by Braque, Picasso, [[Fernand L\u00e9ger]], [[Juan Gris]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Marcel Duchamp]] and countless other artists into the 1920s. [[Synthetic cubism]] is characterized by the introduction of different textures, surfaces, [[collage]] elements, [[papier coll\u00e9]] and a large variety of merged subject matter.\n[[Image:Bonnard-the dining room in the country.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pierre Bonnard]], 1913, European [[Modernism|modernist Narrative painting]]]]\n[[Image:De Chirico's Love Song.jpg|thumb|[[Giorgio de Chirico]] 1914, pre-[[Surrealism]]]]\n\nLes Fauves (French for ''The Wild Beasts'') were early-20th-century painters, experimenting with freedom of expression through color. The name was given, humorously and not as a compliment, to the group by art critic [[Louis Vauxcelles]]. [[Fauvism]] was a short-lived and loose grouping of early-20th-century artists whose works emphasized [[painterly]] qualities, and the imaginative use of deep color over the representational values. Fauvists made the subject of the painting easy to read, exaggerated perspectives and an interesting prescient prediction of the Fauves was expressed in 1888 by [[Paul Gauguin]] to [[Paul S\u00e9rusier]],\n\n''\"How do you see these trees? They are yellow. So, put in yellow; this shadow, rather blue, paint it with pure [[ultramarine]]; these red leaves? Put in [[vermilion]].\"''\n\nThe leaders of the movement were [[Henri Matisse]] and [[Andr\u00e9 Derain]] \u2014 friendly rivals of a sort, each with his own followers. Ultimately [[Matisse]] became the ''yang'' to [[Picasso]]'s ''yin'' in the 20th century. Fauvist painters included [[Albert Marquet]], [[Charles Camoin]], [[Maurice de Vlaminck]], [[Raoul Dufy]], [[Othon Friesz]], the Dutch painter [[Kees van Dongen]], and Picasso's partner in Cubism, [[Georges Braque]] amongst others.<ref>{{cite book| author = John Elderfield|author2=Stephen Andrew Roberts| title = European Co-operation on Social Science Information and Documentation (ECSSID) Technical Meeting, University of Kent at Canterbury, 25th-26th March 1991: Report to British Library Research & Development Department| year = 1991| isbn = 978-0-87070-638-7 }}</ref>\nFauvism, as a movement, had no concrete theories, and was short lived, beginning in 1905 and ending in 1907, they only had three exhibitions. Matisse was seen as the leader of the movement, due to his seniority in age and prior self-establishment in the academic art world. His 1905 portrait of Mme. Matisse ''The Green Line'', (above), caused a sensation in Paris when it was first exhibited. He said he wanted to create art to delight; art as a decoration was his purpose and it can be said that his use of bright colors tries to maintain serenity of composition. In 1906 at the suggestion of his dealer [[Ambroise Vollard]], [[Andr\u00e9 Derain]] went to London and produced a series of paintings like ''Charing Cross Bridge, London'' (above) in the [[Fauvism|Fauvist]] style, paraphrasing the famous series by the [[Impressionist]] painter [[Claude Monet]]. Masters like [[Henri Matisse]] and [[Pierre Bonnard]] continued developing their narrative styles independent of any movement throughout the 20th century.\n\nBy 1907 Fauvism no longer was a shocking new movement, soon it was replaced by [[Cubism]] on the critics' radar screen as the latest new development in [[Contemporary Art]] of the time.\nIn 1907 [[Guillaume Apollinaire|Appolinaire]], commenting about Matisse in an article published in La Falange, said, \"We are not here in the presence of an extravagant or an extremist undertaking: Matisse's art is eminently reasonable.\"<ref>{{cite book |author=William Stanley Rubin |author2=Judith Cousins |author3=Museum of Modern Art New York| title = Picasso and Braque: pioneering cubism| year = 1989| isbn = 0-87070-676-4| page = 348 }}</ref>\n[[Analytic cubism]]  was jointly developed by Pablo Picasso and [[Georges Braque]] from about 1908 through 1912.

[[Giorgio De Chirico]] moved to Paris in July 1911, where he joined his brother Andrea (the poet and painter known as [[Alberto Savinio]]). Through his brother he met Pierre Laprade a member of the jury at the Salon d'Automne, where he exhibited three of his dreamlike works: ''Enigma of the Oracle'', ''Enigma of an Afternoon'' and ''Self-Portrait''. During 1913 he exhibited his work at the [[Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants]] and Salon d'Automne, his work was noticed by [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] and several others. His compelling and mysterious paintings are considered instrumental to the early beginnings of [[Surrealism]].

Van Gogh's painting exerted great influence upon 20th-century [[Expressionism]], as can be seen in the work of the [[Fauvism|Fauves]], [[Die Br\u00fccke]] (a group led by German painter [[Ernst Kirchner]]), and the Expressionism of [[Edvard Munch]], [[Egon Schiele]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]], [[Chaim Soutine]] and others..\n\n[[Wassily Kandinsky]] a Russian painter, [[printmaker]] and art theorist, one of the most famous 20th-century artists is generally considered the first important painter of [[Modern Art|modern]] abstract art. As an early Modernist, in search of new modes of visual expression, and spiritual expression, he theorized as did contemporary [[occultists]] and [[theosophists]], that pure visual abstraction had corollary vibrations with sound and music. They posited that pure abstraction could express pure spirituality. His earliest abstractions were generally titled as the example in the (above gallery) ''Composition VII'', making connection to the work of the composers of music. Kandinsky included many of his theories about abstract art in his book ''Concerning the Spiritual in Art.'' [[Robert Delaunay]] was a French artist who is associated with [[Orphism (art)|Orphism]], (reminiscent of a link between pure abstraction and cubism). His later works were more abstract, reminiscent of [[Paul Klee]]. His key contributions to abstract painting refer to his bold use of color, and a clear love of experimentation of both depth and tone. At the invitation of [[Wassily Kandinsky]], Delaunay and his wife the artist [[Sonia Delaunay]], joined The Blue Rider ([[Der Blaue Reiter]]), a [[Munich]]-based group of abstract artists, in 1911, and his art took a turn to the abstract.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tate.org.uk/collections/glossary/definition.jsp?entryId=86 |title=Der Blaue Reiter |publisher= Tate Glossary |accessdate=10 August 2009 }}</ref>\n\nOther major pioneers of early abstraction include Russian painter [[Kasimir Malevich]], who after the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]] in 1917, and after pressure from the [[Stalinist]] regime in 1924 returned to painting imagery and ''Peasants and Workers in the field'', and Swiss painter [[Paul Klee]] whose masterful color experiments made him an important pioneer of [[abstract painting]] at the [[Bauhaus]]. Still other important pioneers of abstract painting include the Swedish artist [[Hilma af Klint]], Czech painter [[Franti\u0161ek Kupka]] as well as American artists [[Stanton MacDonald-Wright]] and [[Morgan Russell]] who, in 1912, founded [[Synchromism]], an art movement that closely resembles [[Orphism (art)|Orphism]].\n\n''[[Expressionism]]'' and ''[[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]]'' are broad rubrics that involve several important and related movements in 20th-century painting that dominated much of the avant-garde art being made in Western, Eastern and Northern Europe. Expressionist works were painted largely between World War I and World War II, mostly in France, Germany, Norway, Russia, Belgium, and Austria. Expressionist artists are related to both Surrealism and Symbolism and are each uniquely and somewhat eccentrically personal. [[Fauvism]], [[Die Br\u00fccke]], and [[Der Blaue Reiter]] are three of the best known groups of Expressionist and Symbolist painters.\n\nArtists as interesting and diverse as [[Marc Chagall]], whose painting ''[[I and the Village]]'', (above) tells an autobiographical story that examines the relationship between the artist and his origins, with a lexicon of artistic [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]]. [[Gustav Klimt]], [[Egon Schiele]], [[Edvard Munch]], [[Emil Nolde]], [[Chaim Soutine]], [[James Ensor]], [[Oskar Kokoschka]], [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]], [[Max Beckmann]], [[Franz Marc]], [[K\u00e4the Schmidt Kollwitz]], [[Georges Rouault]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]] and some of the Americans abroad like [[Marsden Hartley]], and [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]], were considered influential expressionist painters. Although [[Alberto Giacometti]] is primarily thought of as an intense [[Surrealist]] sculptor, he made intense expressionist paintings as well.\n\n====Pioneers of abstraction====\n<gallery widths=\"140px\" heights=\"140px\" perrow=\"4\">\nFile:Gray Tree 1911.jpg|[[Piet Mondrian]], 1912, early [[De Stijl]]\nImage:Malevici06.jpg|[[Kasimir Malevich]] 1916, [[Suprematism]]\nImage:Theo van Doesburg Composition VII (the three graces).jpg|[[Theo van Doesburg]] 1917, [[De Stijl]], [[Neo-Plasticism]]\nImage:MacDonaldWright_AirplaneSynchYelOrng.jpg|[[Stanton MacDonald-Wright]] 1920, [[Synchromism]]\n</gallery>\n[[Piet Mondrian]]'s art was also related to his spiritual and philosophical studies. In 1908 he became interested in the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophical]] movement launched by [[Helena Petrovna Blavatsky]] in the late 19th century. Blavatsky believed that it was possible to attain a knowledge of nature more profound than that provided by empirical means, and much of Mondrian's work for the rest of his life was inspired by his search for that spiritual knowledge.\n\n[[File:Piet Mondriaan, 1939-1942 - Composition 10.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Piet Mondrian]], ''\"Composition No. 10\"'' 1939\u201342, [[De Stijl]]]]\n[[File:Cosmic Synchrony.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Morgan Russell]], ''Cosmic Synchromy'' (1913-14), [[Synchromism]]]]\n[[De Stijl]] also known as [[neoplasticism]], was a Dutch artistic movement founded in 1917.

Next to van Doesburg, the group's principal members were the painters [[Piet Mondrian]], [[Vilmos Husz\u00e1r]], and [[Bart van der Leck]], and the architects [[Gerrit Rietveld]], [[Robert van 't Hoff]], and [[J. J. P. Oud]]. The artistic philosophy that formed a basis for the group's work is known as ''neoplasticism'' \u2014 the new plastic art (or ''Nieuwe Beelding'' in Dutch).\n\nProponents of De Stijl sought to express a new [[utopia]]n ideal of spiritual harmony and order. They advocated pure [[abstract art|abstraction]] and universality by a reduction to the essentials of form and colour; they simplified visual compositions to the vertical and horizontal directions, and used only [[primary colors]] along with black and white. Indeed, according to the [[Tate Gallery]]'s online article on neoplasticism, Mondrian himself sets forth these delimitations in his essay \"Neo-Plasticism in Pictorial Art\". He writes, \"...&nbsp;this new plastic idea will ignore the particulars of appearance, that is to say, natural form and colour. On the contrary, it should find its expression in the abstraction of form and colour, that is to say, in the straight line and the clearly defined primary colour.\" The Tate article further summarizes that this art allows \"only primary colours and non-colours, only squares and rectangles, only straight and horizontal or vertical line.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tate.org.uk/collections/glossary/definition.jsp?entryId=191 |title=Neo-Plasticism |publisher=tate.org.uk}}</ref> The [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]]'s online article on De Stijl summarizes these traits in similar terms: \"It [De Stijl] was posited on the fundamental principle of the geometry of the straight line, the square, and the rectangle, combined with a strong asymmetricality; the predominant use of pure primary colors with black and white; and the relationship between positive and negative elements in an arrangement of non-objective forms and lines.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/glossary_De_Stijl.html |title=The style; Holland, 1917 |publisher=guggenheimcollection.org |accessdate=30 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821042905/http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/glossary_De_Stijl.html |archivedate=21 August 2008 |df= }}</ref>\n\nDe Stijl movement was influenced by [[Cubist]] painting as well as by the mysticism and the ideas about \"ideal\" geometric forms (such as the \"perfect straight line\") in the [[neoplatonic]] philosophy of [[mathematician]] [[M. H. J. Schoenmaekers]]. The works of De Stijl would influence the [[Bauhaus]] style and the [[International Style (architecture)|international style]] of architecture as well as clothing and interior design. However, it did not follow the general guidelines of an \"ism\" (Cubism, Futurism, Surrealism), nor did it adhere to the principles of art schools like Bauhaus; it was a collective project, a joint enterprise.\n\n====Dada and Surrealism====\n{{main|Dada|Surrealism}}\n<gallery widths=\"160px\" heights=\"160px\" perrow=\"4\">\nImage:Picabia Machine Turn.jpg|[[Francis Picabia]] 1916, Dada\nImage:DasUndbild.jpg|[[Kurt Schwitters]], 1919, [[collage|painted collage]], [[Dada]]\nFile:The Elephant Celebes.jpg|[[Max Ernst]], 1921), Surrealism\nImage:Pedestal Table in the Studio.jpg|[[Andr\u00e9 Masson]], 1922, early Surrealism\n</gallery>\n\n[[File:Francis Picabia, 1915, New York..jpg|thumb|250px|[[Francis Picabia]], (Left) ''Le saint des saints c'est de moi qu'il s'agit dans ce portrait'', 1 July 1915; (center) ''Portrait d'une jeune fille americaine dans l'\u00e9tat de nudit\u00e9'', 5 July 1915: (right) ''J'ai vu et c'est de toi qu'il s'agit, De Zayas!

After Duchamp's [[Nude Descending a Staircase]] became the international cause celebre at the 1913 Armory show in New York he created ''[[The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even]], [[Large Glass]]''. The ''[[Large Glass]]'' pushed the art of painting to radical new limits being part painting, part collage, part construction. Duchamp became closely associated with the [[Dada]] movement that began in neutral [[Zurich]], Switzerland, during World War I and peaked from 1916 to 1920. The movement primarily involved visual arts, literature (poetry, art manifestoes, art theory), theatre, and graphic design, and concentrated its anti war politic through a rejection of the prevailing standards in art through [[anti-art]] cultural works. [[Francis Picabia]], [[Man Ray]], [[Kurt Schwitters]], [[Tristan Tzara]], [[Hans Richter (artist)|Hans Richter]], [[Jean Arp]], [[Sophie Taeuber-Arp]], along with Duchamp and many others are associated with the Dadaist movement. Duchamp and several [[Dadaists]] are also associated with Surrealism, the movement that dominated European painting in the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nIn 1924 [[Andr\u00e9 Breton]] published the ''[[Surrealist Manifesto]].'' The [[Surrealist]] movement in painting became synonymous with the [[avant-garde]] and which featured artists whose works varied from the abstract to the super-realist. With works on paper like ''Machine Turn Quickly'', (above) Francis Picabia continued his involvement in the [[Dada]] movement through 1919 in [[Zurich]] and Paris, before breaking away from it after developing an interest in [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] art. [[Yves Tanguy]], [[Ren\u00e9 Magritte]] and [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]] are particularly known for their realistic depictions of dream imagery and fantastic manifestations of the imagination. [[Joan Mir\u00f3]]'s ''[[The Tilled Field]]'' of 1923\u20131924 verges on abstraction, this early painting of a complex of objects and figures, and arrangements of sexually active characters; was Mir\u00f3's first Surrealist masterpiece.<ref>Spector, Nancy. \"[http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/artist_work_md_109_7.html The Tilled Field, 1923\u20131924] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925010715/http://www.guggenheimcollection.org/site/artist_work_md_109_7.html |date=25 September 2008 }}\".

The more abstract [[Joan Mir\u00f3]], [[Jean Arp]], [[Andr\u00e9 Masson]], and [[Max Ernst]] were very influential, especially in the United States during the 1940s.\nThroughout the 1930s, Surrealism continued to become more visible to the public at large. A [[British Surrealist Group|Surrealist group developed in Britain]] and, according to Breton, their 1936 [[London International Surrealist Exhibition]] was a high water mark of the period and became the model for international exhibitions. Surrealist groups in Japan, and especially in Latin America, the Caribbean and in Mexico produced innovative and original works.\n\nDal\u00ed and [[Ren\u00e9 Magritte|Magritte]] created some of the most widely recognized images of the movement. The 1928/1929 painting ''This Is Not A Pipe'', by [[Ren\u00e9 Magritte|Magritte]] is the subject of a [[Michel Foucault]] 1973 book, ''This is not a Pipe'' (English edition, 1991), that discusses the painting and its [[paradox]]. Dal\u00ed joined the group in 1929, and participated in the rapid establishment of the visual style between 1930 and 1935.\n\nSurrealism as a visual movement had found a method: to expose psychological truth by stripping ordinary objects of their normal significance, in order to create a compelling image that was beyond ordinary formal organization, and perception, sometimes evoking empathy from the viewer, sometimes laughter and sometimes outrage and bewilderment.\n\n1931 marked a year when several Surrealist painters produced works which marked turning points in their stylistic evolution: in one example, liquid shapes become the trademark of Dal\u00ed, particularly in his ''[[The Persistence of Memory]]'', which features the image of watches that sag as if they are melting. Evocations of time and its compelling mystery and absurdity.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?object_id=79018 |title=The Persistence of Memory |publisher=MoMA Online Collection }}</ref>\n\nThe characteristics of this style \u2013 a combination of the depictive, the abstract, and the psychological \u2013 came to stand for the alienation which many people felt in the [[Modernism|modernist]] period, combined with the sense of reaching more deeply into the psyche, to be \"made whole with one's individuality.\"\n[[File:Murdering Airplane.jpg|thumb|[[Max Ernst]], 1920, early [[Surrealism]]]]\nMax Ernst whose 1920 painting ''Murdering Airplane'', studied philosophy and psychology in Bonn and was interested in the alternative realities experienced by the insane. His paintings may have been inspired by the [[psychoanalyst]] [[Sigmund Freud]]'s study of the delusions of a paranoiac, Daniel Paul Schreber. Freud identified Schreber's fantasy of becoming a woman as a ''[[castration complex]].'' The central image of two pairs of legs refers to Schreber's hermaphroditic desires. Ernst's inscription on the back of the painting reads: ''The picture is curious because of its symmetry. The two sexes balance one another.''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?cgroupid=999999961&workid=4133&searchid=19833&tabview=text |title=Max Ernst (1891\u20131976).

Mir\u00f3 acknowledged in letters to his dealer [[Pierre Matisse]] the importance of Masson as an example to him in his early years in Paris.\n\nLong after personal, political and professional tensions have fragmented the Surrealist group into thin air and ether, Magritte, Mir\u00f3, Dal\u00ed and the other Surrealists continue to define a visual program in the arts. Other prominent surrealist artists include [[Giorgio de Chirico]], [[M\u00e9ret Oppenheim]], [[Toyen]], [[Gr\u00e9goire Michonze]], [[Roberto Matta]], [[Kay Sage]], [[Leonora Carrington]], [[Dorothea Tanning]], and [[Leonor Fini]] among others.\n\n====Before and after the war====\n<gallery widths=\"140px\" heights=\"140px\" perrow=\"6\">\nFile:Egon Schiele - Self-Portrait with Physalis - Google Art Project.jpg|[[Egon Schiele]], [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] and [[Expressionism]] 1912\nFile:Kirchner 1913 Street, Berlin.jpg|[[Ernst Kirchner]], [[Die Br\u00fccke]] 1913\nImage:Modigliani - Nu couch\u00e9.jpg|[[Amedeo Modigliani]] [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] and [[Expressionism]] 1917\nImage:Davis steeple street.jpg|[[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]], American [[Modernism]] 1922\nFile:1920, Soutine, Chemin de la Fontaine des Tins at C\u00e9ret.jpg|[[Chaim Soutine]], [[Expressionism]], c. 1920\n</gallery>\n[[File:Die Zwitscher-Maschine (Twittering Machine).jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Paul Klee]], 1922, [[Bauhaus]]]]\n[[Der Blaue Reiter]] was a German movement lasting from 1911 to 1914, fundamental to Expressionism, along with [[Die Br\u00fccke]] which was founded the previous decade in 1905 and was a group of German [[expressionist]] artists formed in [[Dresden]] in 1905. Founding members of Die Br\u00fccke were [[Fritz Bleyl]], [[Erich Heckel]], [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]] and [[Karl Schmidt-Rottluff]].

Der Blaue Reiter lacked a central artistic manifesto, but was centered around Kandinsky and Marc. Artists [[Gabriele M\u00fcnter]] and [[Paul Klee]] were also involved.\n[[File:Patrick Henry Bruce Stilleben.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Patrick Henry Bruce]], [[American modernism]], 1924]]\n\nThe name of the movement comes from a painting by Kandinsky created in 1903. It is also claimed that the name could have derived from Marc's enthusiasm for horses and Kandinsky's love of the colour blue. For Kandinsky, ''blue'' is the colour of spirituality: the darker the blue, the more it awakens human desire for the eternal.\n\nIn the USA during the period between World War I and World War II painters tended to go to Europe for recognition. Artists like [[Marsden Hartley]], [[Patrick Henry Bruce]], [[Gerald Murphy]] and [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]], created reputations abroad. In New York City, [[Albert Pinkham Ryder]] and [[Ralph Albert Blakelock|Ralph Blakelock]] were influential and important figures in advanced American painting between 1900 and 1920.

In Germany [[Max Beckmann]], [[Otto Dix]], [[George Grosz]] and others politicized their paintings, foreshadowing the coming of World War II. While in America [[American Scene painting]] and the [[social realism]] and [[regionalism (art)|regionalism]] movements that contained both political and social commentary dominated the art world. Artists like [[Ben Shahn]], [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]], [[Grant Wood]], [[George Tooker]], [[John Steuart Curry]], [[Reginald Marsh (artist)|Reginald Marsh]], and others became prominent. In Latin America besides the [[Uruguay]]an painter [[Joaqu\u00edn Torres Garc\u00eda]] and [[Rufino Tamayo]] from Mexico, the [[Mexican muralism|muralist movement]] with [[Diego Rivera]], [[David Siqueiros]], [[Jos\u00e9 Orozco]], [[Pedro Nel G\u00f3mez]] and [[Santiago Martinez Delgado]] and the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] paintings by [[Frida Kahlo]] began a renaissance of the arts for the region, with a use of color and historic, and political messages. [[Frida Kahlo]]'s Symbolist works also relate strongly to Surrealism and to the [[Magic Realism]] movement in literature. The psychological drama in many of Kahlo's self portraits (above) underscore the vitality and relevance of her paintings to artists in the 21st century.\n\n''[[American Gothic]]'' is a painting by [[Grant Wood]] from 1930. Portraying a [[pitchfork]]-holding farmer and a younger woman in front of a house of [[Carpenter Gothic]] style, it is one of the most familiar images in 20th-century [[Visual art of the United States|American art]]. Art critics had favorable opinions about the painting, like [[Gertrude Stein]] and [[Christopher Morley]], they assumed the painting was meant to be a satire of rural small-town life. It was thus seen as part of the trend towards increasingly critical depictions of rural America, along the lines of [[Sherwood Anderson]]'s ''1919 [[Winesburg, Ohio (novel)|Winesburg, Ohio]]'', [[Sinclair Lewis]]' 1920 ''[[Main Street (novel)|Main Street]]'', and [[Carl Van Vechten]]'s ''The Tattooed Countess'' in literature.<ref name=\"slate\">Fineman, Mia, [http://www.slate.com/id/2120494/ The Most Famous Farm Couple in the World: Why American Gothic still fascinates.], ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', 8 June 2005</ref> However, with the onset of the [[Great Depression]], the painting came to be seen as a depiction of steadfast American pioneer spirit.\n\nDiego Rivera is perhaps best known by the public world for his 1933 mural, \"[[Man at the Crossroads]]\", in the lobby of the RCA Building at [[Rockefeller Center]]. When his patron [[Nelson Rockefeller]] discovered that the mural included a portrait of [[Vladimir Lenin]] and other communist imagery, he fired Rivera, and the unfinished work was eventually destroyed by Rockefeller's staff. The film ''[[Cradle Will Rock]]'' includes a dramatization of the controversy. [[Frida Kahlo]] (Rivera's wife's) works are often characterized by their stark portrayals of pain. Of her 143 paintings 55 are [[Self portrait|self-portraits]], which frequently incorporate symbolic portrayals of her physical and psychological wounds. Kahlo was deeply influenced by indigenous Mexican culture, which is apparent in her paintings' bright colors and dramatic symbolism. Christian and Jewish themes are often depicted in her work as well; she combined elements of the classic religious Mexican tradition\u2014which were often bloody and violent\u2014with [[surrealist]] renderings. While her paintings are not overtly Christian \u2013 she was, after all, an avowed communist \u2013 they certainly contain elements of the macabre Mexican Christian style of religious paintings.\n\nPolitical activism was an important piece of [[David Siqueiros]]' life, and frequently inspired him to set aside his artistic career. His art was deeply rooted in the [[Mexican Revolution]], a violent and chaotic period in Mexican history in which various social and political factions fought for recognition and power. The period from the 1920s to the 1950s is known as the Mexican Renaissance, and Siqueiros was active in the attempt to create an art that was at once Mexican and universal. He briefly gave up painting to focus on organizing miners in Jalisco.\n\n====World conflict====\n<gallery widths=\"140px\" heights=\"140px\" perrow=\"4\">\nFile:Ernst Ludwig Kirchner - Bogensch\u00fctzen -1935-37.jpg|[[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]], 1935\u20131937, [[German Expressionism]]\nFile:Wassily Kandinsky, 1939 - Composition X.png|[[Wassily Kandinsky]] ''Composition X'' 1939, [[Geometric abstraction]]\n</gallery>\nDuring the 1930s radical leftist politics characterized many of the artists connected to [[Surrealism]], including [[Pablo Picasso]].<ref>Lewis, Helena.

Pablo Picasso painted his mural sized ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]'' to commemorate the horrors of the bombing.\n[[Image:PicassoGuernica.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pablo Picasso]] [[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]] 1937, protest against Fascism]]\nIn its final form, ''Guernica'' is an immense black and white, {{convert|3.5|m|ft|abbr=off}} tall and {{convert|7.8|m|ft|abbr=off}} wide mural painted in oil. The mural presents a scene of death, violence, brutality, suffering, and helplessness without portraying their immediate causes. The choice to paint in black and white contrasts with the intensity of the scene depicted and invokes the immediacy of a newspaper photograph.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arthistoryarchive.com/arthistory/cubism/Pablo-Picasso.html|title=Pablo Picasso \u2013 Biography, Quotes & Paintings |publisher=arthistoryarchive.com |accessdate=14 June 2007}}</ref>\nPicasso painted the mural sized painting called ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]'' in protest of the bombing. The painting was first exhibited in Paris in 1937, then [[Scandinavia]], then London in 1938 and finally in 1939 at Picasso's request the painting was sent to the United States in an extended loan (for safekeeping) at [[MoMA]]. The painting went on a tour of museums throughout the USA until its final return to the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City where it was exhibited for nearly thirty years. Finally in accord with [[Pablo Picasso]]'s wish to give the painting to the people of Spain as a gift, it was sent to Spain in 1981.\n[[File:Max Beckmann, 1918-19, The Night (Die Nacht), oil on canvas, 133 x 154 cm, Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen, D\u00fcsseldorf.jpg|thumb|[[Max Beckmann]], ''[[The Night (painting)|The Night (Die Nacht)]]'', 1918\u20131919, [[Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen]], D\u00fcsseldorf]]\nDuring the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s, through the years of World War II American art was characterized by [[Social Realism]] and [[American Scene Painting]] in the work of [[Grant Wood]], [[Edward Hopper]], [[Ben Shahn]], [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]], and several others. ''[[Nighthawks]]'' (1942) is a painting by Edward Hopper that portrays people sitting in a downtown [[diner]] late at night. It is not only Hopper's most famous painting, but one of the most recognizable in American art. It is currently in the collection of the [[Art Institute of Chicago]]. The scene was inspired by a [[diner]] (since demolished) in [[Greenwich Village]], Hopper's home neighborhood in [[Manhattan]]. Hopper began painting it immediately after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. After this event there was a large feeling of gloominess over the country, a feeling that is portrayed in the painting. The urban street is empty outside the diner, and inside none of the three patrons is apparently looking or talking to the others but instead is lost in their own thoughts. This portrayal of modern urban life as empty or lonely is a common theme throughout Hopper's work.\n\nThe Dynamic for artists in Europe during the 1930s deteriorated rapidly as the Nazi's power in Germany and across Eastern Europe increased. The climate became so hostile for artists and art associated with [[Modernism]] and [[Abstract art|abstraction]] that many left for the Americas. ''[[Degenerate art]]'' was a term adopted by the [[Nazi]] regime in Germany for virtually all [[modern art]]. Such art was banned on the grounds that it was un-German or [[Jewish Bolshevism|Jewish Bolshevist]] in nature, and those identified as degenerate artists were subjected to sanctions. These included being dismissed from teaching positions, being forbidden to exhibit or to sell their art, and in some cases being forbidden to produce art entirely.\n\n''Degenerate Art'' was also the title of an exhibition, mounted by the Nazis in [[Munich]] in 1937, consisting of modernist artworks chaotically hung and accompanied by text labels deriding the art. Designed to inflame public opinion against modernism, the exhibition subsequently traveled to several other cities in Germany and Austria. German artist [[Max Beckmann]] and scores of others fled Europe for New York. In New York City a new generation of young and exciting Modernist painters led by [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Willem de Kooning]], and others were just beginning to come of age.\n\n[[Arshile Gorky]]'s portrait of someone who might be [[Willem de Kooning]] (above) is an example of the evolution of [[abstract expressionism]] from the context of figure painting, [[cubism]] and [[surrealism]]. Along with his friends de Kooning and [[John D. Graham]] Gorky created bio-morphically shaped and abstracted figurative compositions that by the 1940s evolved into totally abstract paintings. Gorky's work seems to be a careful analysis of memory, emotion and shape, using line and color to express feeling and nature.\n\n====Towards mid-century====\n[[File:Nighthawks by Edward Hopper 1942.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Edward Hopper]] 1942, [[American Scene painting]]]]\nThe 1940s in New York City heralded the triumph of American [[abstract expressionism]], a modernist movement that combined lessons learned from [[Henri Matisse]], [[Pablo Picasso]], Surrealism, [[Joan Mir\u00f3]], Cubism, [[Fauvism]], and early Modernism via great teachers in America like [[Hans Hofmann]] and [[John D. Graham]]. American artists benefited from the presence of [[Piet Mondrian]], [[Fernand L\u00e9ger]], [[Max Ernst]] and the [[Andr\u00e9 Breton]] group, Pierre Matisse's gallery, and [[Peggy Guggenheim]]'s gallery ''[[The Art of This Century]]'', as well as other factors. The figurative work of [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]], [[Frida Kahlo]], [[Edward Hopper]], [[Lucian Freud]], [[Andrew Wyeth]] and others served as a kind of alternative to abstract expressionism.\n\nPost-Second World War American painting called Abstract expressionism included artists like [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Willem de Kooning]], [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Mark Rothko]], [[Hans Hofmann]], [[Clyfford Still]], [[Franz Kline]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], [[Mark Tobey]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[James Brooks (painter)|James Brooks]], [[Philip Guston]], [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Conrad Marca-Relli]], [[Jack Tworkov]], [[William Baziotes]], [[Richard Pousette-Dart]], [[Ad Reinhardt]], [[Hedda Sterne]], [[Jimmy Ernst]], [[Esteban Vicente]], [[Bradley Walker Tomlin]], and [[Theodoros Stamos]], among others. American Abstract expressionism got its name in 1946 from the art critic [[Robert Coates (critic)|Robert Coates]]. It is seen as combining the emotional intensity and self-denial of the German Expressionists with the anti-figurative aesthetic of the European abstract schools such as [[futurism (art)|futurism]], the [[Bauhaus]] and synthetic cubism. Abstract expressionism, [[action painting]], and [[Color Field]] painting are synonymous with the [[New York School (art)|New York School]].\n\nTechnically Surrealism was an important predecessor for abstract expressionism with its emphasis on spontaneous, [[Surrealist automatism|automatic]] or subconscious creation. [[Jackson Pollock]]'s dripping paint onto a canvas laid on the floor is a technique that has its roots in the work of [[Andr\u00e9 Masson]]. Another important ear<nowiki>ly m</nowiki>anifestation of what came to be abstract expressionism is the work of American Northwest artist [[Mark Tobey]], especially his \"white writing\" canvases, which, though generally not large in scale, anticipate the \"all over\" look of Pollock's drip paintings.\n\n====Abstract expressionism====\n{{main|Abstract expressionism|Action painting|Color Field painting|Lyrical Abstraction}}\n<gallery widths=\"140px\" heights=\"140px\" perrow=\"4\">\n\n</gallery>\n[[File:Blue Poles (Jackson Pollock painting).jpg|thumb|300px|[[Jackson Pollock]], ''[[Blue Poles]],'' 1952, [[National Gallery of Australia]]]]\nAdditionally, Abstract expressionism has an image of being rebellious, anarchic, highly idiosyncratic and, some feel, rather nihilistic. In practice, the term is applied to any number of artists working (mostly) in New York who had quite different styles, and even applied to work which is not especially abstract nor expressionist. Pollock's energetic \"[[action painting]]s\", with their \"busy\" feel, are different both technically and aesthetically, to the violent and grotesque ''Women'' series of [[Willem de Kooning]]. As seen above in the gallery ''Woman V'' is one of a series of six paintings made by de Kooning between 1950 and 1953 that depict a three-quarter-length female figure. He began the first of these paintings, ''Woman I'' collection: [[The Museum of Modern Art]], New York City, in June 1950, repeatedly changing and painting out the image until January or February 1952, when the painting was abandoned unfinished. The art historian [[Meyer Schapiro]] saw the painting in de Kooning's studio soon afterwards and encouraged the artist to persist. De Kooning's response was to begin three other paintings on the same theme; ''Woman II'' collection: [[The Museum of Modern Art]], New York City, ''[[Woman III]]'', [[Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art]], ''Woman IV'', [[Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art]], [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. During the summer of 1952, spent at [[East Hampton (town), New York|East Hampton]], de Kooning further explored the theme through drawings and pastels. He may have finished work on ''Woman I'' by the end of June, or possibly as late as November 1952, and probably the other three women pictures were concluded at much the same time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nga.gov.au/International/Catalogue/Detail.cfm?IRN=47761&BioArtistIRN=25281&MnuID=2&GalID=1 |title=Willem De Kooning: Woman V 1952\u201353 |publisher= [[National Gallery of Australia]] |accessdate=30 November 2010}}</ref> The ''Woman series'' are decidedly [[Figurative art|figurative paintings]]. Another important artist is [[Franz Kline]], as demonstrated by his painting ''High Street'', 1950 as with [[Jackson Pollock]] and other Abstract Expressionists, was labelled an \"action painter\" because of his seemingly spontaneous and intense style, focusing less, or not at all, on figures or imagery, but on the actual brush strokes and use of canvas.<ref>[https://hyperallergic.com/66831/painting-at-the-speed-of-sight-franz-klines-rapid-transit/ Painting at the Speed of Light]</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/art-history-definition-action-painting-183188|title=Art History Definition: Action Painting|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2018-05-04}}</ref><ref>[https://www.moma.org/audio/playlist/1/81 Franz Kline, ''Number 2'' (1954), Museum of Modern Art, New York]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0520050150 Rudolf Arnheim, ''The Power of the Center: A Study of Composition in the Visual Arts''], University of California Press, 1983, pp. 71-72, {{ISBN|0520050150}}</ref>\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | header =\n | header_align = left/right/center\n | header_background =\n | footer =\n | footer_align = left/right/center\n | footer_background =\n | width =\n | image1 = Robert Motherwell's 'Elegy to the Spanish Republic No. 110'.jpg\n | width1 = 133\n | caption1 = [[Robert Motherwell]], ''Elegy to the Spanish Republic No. 110''\n | alt1 = see text\n}}\n[[Clyfford Still]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]], and the serenely shimmering blocks of color in [[Mark Rothko]]'s work (which is not what would usually be called expressionist and which Rothko denied was abstract), are classified as abstract expressionists, albeit from what [[Clement Greenberg]] termed the [[Color Field]] direction of abstract expressionism. Both [[Hans Hofmann]] and [[Robert Motherwell]] (gallery) can be comfortably described as practitioners of [[action painting]] and Color Field painting.\n\nAbstract expressionism has many stylistic similarities to the Russian artists of the early 20th century such as [[Wassily Kandinsky]]. Although it is true that spontaneity or of the impression of spontaneity characterized many of the abstract expressionists works, most of these paintings involved careful planning, especially since their large size demanded it. An exception might be the drip paintings of Pollock.\n\nWhy this style gained mainstream acceptance in the 1950s is a matter of debate. American [[Social realism]] had been the mainstream in the 1930s. It had been influenced not only by the [[Great Depression]] but also by the [[Socialist Realism|Social Realists]] of Mexico such as [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]] and [[Diego Rivera]]. The political climate after World War II did not long tolerate the social protests of those painters. Abstract expressionism arose during World War II and began to be showcased during the early 1940s at galleries in New York like ''[[The Art of This Century Gallery]]''. The late 1940s through the mid-1950s ushered in the [[McCarthy era]]. It was after World War II and a time of political conservatism and extreme artistic censorship in the United States. Some people have conjectured that since the subject matter was often totally abstract, Abstract expressionism became a safe strategy for artists to pursue this style. Abstract art could be seen as apolitical. Or if the art was political, the message was largely for the insiders. However, those theorists are in the minority. As the first truly original school of painting in America, Abstract expressionism demonstrated the vitality and creativity of the country in the post-war years, as well as its ability (or need) to develop an aesthetic sense that was not constrained by the European standards of beauty.\n\nAlthough Abstract expressionism spread quickly throughout the United States, the major centers of this style were New York City and California, especially in the [[New York School (art)|New York School]], and the San Francisco Bay area. Abstract expressionist paintings share certain characteristics, including the use of large canvases, an [[all-over painting|\"all-over\"]] approach, in which the whole canvas is treated with equal importance (as opposed to the center being of more interest than the edges). The canvas as the ''arena'' became a credo of action painting, while the [[Picture plane#Integrity of the picture plane|''integrity of the picture plane'']] became a credo of the Color Field painters. Many other artists began exhibiting their abstract expressionist related paintings during the 1950s including [[Alfred Leslie]], [[Sam Francis]], [[Joan Mitchell]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Cy Twombly]], [[Milton Resnick]], [[Michael Goldberg (painter)|Michael Goldberg]], [[Norman Bluhm]], [[Ray Parker (painter)|Ray Parker]], [[Nicolas Carone]], [[Grace Hartigan]], [[Friedel Dzubas]], and [[Robert Goodnough]] among others.  \n\nDuring the 1950s Color Field painting initially referred to a particular type of [[abstract expressionism]], especially the work of [[Mark Rothko]], Clyfford Still, Barnett Newman, [[Robert Motherwell]] and [[Adolph Gottlieb]]. It essentially involved abstract paintings with large, flat expanses of color that expressed the sensual, and visual feelings and properties of large areas of nuanced surface. Art critic [[Clement Greenberg]] perceived Color Field painting as related to but different from Action painting. The overall expanse and gestalt of the work of the early color field painters speaks of an almost religious experience, awestruck in the face of an expanding universe of sensuality, color and surface. During the early-to-mid-1960s, ''Color Field painting'' came to refer to the styles of artists like [[Jules Olitski]], [[Kenneth Noland]], and [[Helen Frankenthaler]], whose works were related to second-generation abstract expressionism, and to younger artists like [[Larry Zox]], and [[Frank Stella]], \u2013 all moving in a new direction. Artists like Clyfford Still, [[Mark Rothko]], [[Hans Hofmann]], [[Morris Louis]], [[Jules Olitski]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[Larry Zox]], and others often used greatly reduced references to nature, and they painted with a highly articulated and psychological use of color. In general these artists eliminated recognizable imagery. In ''Mountains and Sea'', from 1952, a seminal work of [[Color Field]] painting by [[Helen Frankenthaler]] the artist used the stain technique for the first time.\n\nIn Europe there was the continuation of Surrealism, Cubism, Dada and the works of [[Matisse]]. Also in Europe, [[Tachisme]] (the European equivalent to Abstract expressionism) took hold of the newest generation. [[Serge Poliakoff]], [[Nicolas de Sta\u00ebl]], [[Georges Mathieu]], [[Vieira da Silva]], [[Jean Dubuffet]], [[Yves Klein]] and [[Pierre Soulages]] among others are considered important figures in post-war European painting.\n\nEventually abstract painting in America evolved into movements such as [[Neo-Dada]], Color Field painting, [[Post painterly abstraction]], [[Op art]], [[hard-edge painting]], [[Minimal art]], [[shaped canvas]] painting, [[Lyrical Abstraction]], [[Neo-expressionism]] and the continuation of Abstract expressionism. As a response to the tendency toward abstraction imagery emerged through various new movements, notably [[Pop art]].\n\n====Pop art====\n<!-- NOTE TO EDITORS: DO NOT ADD YOUR OWN NAME TO THIS LIST! -->\n{{main|Pop art}}\nEarlier in England in 1956 the term ''Pop Art'' was used by [[Lawrence Alloway]] for paintings that celebrated consumerism of the post World War II era. This movement rejected abstract expressionism and its focus on the hermeneutic and psychological interior, in favor of art which depicted, and often celebrated material consumer culture, advertising, and iconography of the mass production age.<ref>{{cite book| last = Alloway| first = Lawrence| title = Topics in American art: since 1945| year = 1975| publisher = W.

Although the paintings of [[Gerald Murphy]], [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]] and [[Charles Demuth]] during the 1920s and 1930s set the table for pop art in America. In New York City during the mid-1950s [[Robert Rauschenberg]] and [[Jasper Johns]] created works of art that at first seemed to be continuations of [[Abstract expressionist]] painting. Actually their works and the work of [[Larry Rivers]], were radical departures from abstract expressionism especially in the use of banal and literal imagery and the inclusion and the combining of mundane materials into their work. The innovations of Johns' specific use of various images and objects like chairs, numbers, targets, beer cans and the American flag; Rivers paintings of subjects drawn from popular culture such as [[George Washington]] crossing the [[Delaware]], and his inclusions of images from advertisements like the camel from [[Camel cigarettes]], and Rauschenberg's surprising constructions using inclusions of objects and pictures taken from popular culture, hardware stores, junkyards, the city streets, and [[taxidermy]] gave rise to a radical new movement in [[Visual art of the United States|American art]]. Eventually by 1963 the movement came to be known worldwide as pop art.\n\nAmerican pop art is exemplified by artists: [[Andy Warhol]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Wayne Thiebaud]], [[James Rosenquist]], [[Jim Dine]], [[Tom Wesselmann]] and [[Roy Lichtenstein]] among others. Lichtenstein's most important work is arguably ''[[Whaam!]]'' (1963, [[Tate Modern]], London<ref name=\"Tate_Whaam\">{{cite web\n |url=http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?workid=8782\n |work=Tate Collection\n |title=Whaam!\n |first=Roy\n |last=Lichtenstein\n |accessdate=27 January 2008\n}}</ref>), one of the earliest known examples of [[pop art]], adapted a [[comic-book]] panel from a 1962 issue of [[DC Comics]]' ''[[All-American Men of War]]''.<ref name=\"Lichtenstein_Foundation_Whaam\">{{cite web\n |url=http://www.image-duplicator.com/main.php?decade=60&year=63&work_id=137\n |work=Roy Lichtenstein Foundation website\n |title=Whaam!\n |first=Roy\n |last=Lichtenstein\n |accessdate=12 September 2009\n}}</ref> The painting depicts a fighter aircraft firing a rocket into an enemy plane, with a red-and-yellow explosion.

In October 1962 the [[Sidney Janis]] Gallery mounted ''The New Realists'' the first major pop art group exhibition in an uptown art gallery in New York City. [[Sidney Janis]] mounted the exhibition in a 57th Street storefront near his gallery at 15 E. 57th Street. The show sent shockwaves through the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] and reverberated worldwide. Earlier in the fall of 1962 an historically important and ground-breaking ''[[New Painting of Common Objects]]'' exhibition of pop art, curated by [[Walter Hopps]] at the [[Pasadena Art Museum]] sent shock waves across the Western United States.\n\nWhile in the downtown scene in New York City's [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] [[Tenth street galleries|10th Street galleries]] artists were formulating an American version of [[Pop Art]]. [[Claes Oldenburg]] had his storefront and made painted objects, and the [[Green Gallery]] on [[57th Street (Manhattan)|57th Street]] began to show [[Tom Wesselmann]] and [[James Rosenquist]]. Later [[Leo Castelli]] exhibited other American artists including the bulk of the careers of Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein and his use of Benday dots, a technique used in commercial reproduction. There is a connection between the radical works of Duchamp, and [[Man Ray]], the rebellious Dadaists \u2013 with a sense of humor; and pop artists like [[Alex Katz]] (who became known for his parodies of portrait photography and suburban life), Claes Oldenburg, Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein and the others.\n\nWhile throughout the 20th century many painters continued to practice landscape and figurative painting with contemporary subjects and solid technique, like [[Milton Avery]], [[John D. Graham]], [[Fairfield Porter]], [[Edward Hopper]], [[Balthus]], [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]], [[Nicolas de Sta\u00ebl]], [[Andrew Wyeth]], [[Lucian Freud]], [[Frank Auerbach]], [[Philip Pearlstein]], [[David Park (painter)|David Park]], [[Nathan Oliveira]], [[David Hockney]], [[Malcolm Morley]], [[Richard Estes]], [[Ralph Goings]], [[Audrey Flack]], [[Chuck Close]], [[Susan Rothenberg]], [[Eric Fischl]], [[Vija Celmins]] and [[Richard Diebenkorn]].\n\n====Figurative, landscape, still-Life, seascape, and Realism====\n<gallery widths=\"140px\" heights=\"140px\" perrow=\"4\">\n|[[Edward Hopper]], ''The El Station'' (1908) [[Cityscape]]\n\n</gallery>\n\nDuring the 1930s through the 1960s abstract painting in America and Europe evolved into movements such as [[abstract expressionism]], Color Field painting, [[Post painterly abstraction]], [[Op art]], [[hard-edge painting]], [[Minimal art]], [[shaped canvas]] painting, and [[Lyrical Abstraction]]. Other artists reacted as a response to the tendency toward abstraction, allowing figurative imagery to continue through various new contexts like the [[Bay Area Figurative Movement]] in the 1950s and new forms of [[expressionism]] from the 1940s through the 1960s. In Italy during this time, [[Giorgio Morandi]] was the foremost still life painter, exploring a wide variety of approaches to depicting everyday bottles and kitchen implements.<ref>David Piper, p. 635</ref> Throughout the 20th century many painters practiced [[Realism (visual arts)|Realism]] and used expressive imagery; practicing landscape and figurative painting with contemporary subjects and solid technique, and unique expressivity like [[still-life]] painter [[Giorgio Morandi]], [[Milton Avery]], [[John D.

Along with [[Henri Matisse]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Pierre Bonnard]], [[Georges Braque]], and other 20th-century masters. In particular Milton Avery through his use of color and his interest in seascape and landscape paintings connected with the Color field aspect of Abstract expressionism as manifested by [[Adolph Gottlieb]] and [[Mark Rothko]] as well as the lessons American painters took from the work of [[Henri Matisse]].<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0DEEDA1139F934A35752C0A9639C8B63&ref=miltonavery NY Times, Grace Glueck, Art in Review; ''Milton Avery &ndash; Onrushing Waves'']</ref><ref>[http://observer.com/2002/05/the-summer-of-57-with-milton-avery-gottlieb-rothko/ Hilton Kramer, NY Observer, ''Summer of 57 with Avery, Gottlieb, Rothko'']</ref>\n\n''[[Head VI]]'', 1949 is a painting by the Irish born artist [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]] and is an example of Post World War II European [[Expressionism]].

Born in [[Bologna, Italy]] in 1890, throughout his career, Morandi concentrated almost exclusively on still lives and landscapes, except for a few self-portraits. With great sensitivity to tone, color, and compositional balance, he would depict the same familiar bottles and vases again and again in paintings notable for their simplicity of execution. Morandi executed 133 etchings, a significant body of work in its own right, and his drawings and watercolors often approach abstraction in their economy of means. Through his simple and repetitive motifs and economical use of color, value and surface, Morandi became a prescient and important forerunner of [[Minimalism]]. He died in Bologna in 1964.\n\nAfter World War II the term [[School of Paris]] often referred to [[Tachisme]], the European equivalent of American Abstract expressionism and those artists are also related to [[COBRA (avant-garde movement)|Cobra]]. Important proponents being [[Jean Dubuffet]], [[Pierre Soulages]], [[Nicholas de Sta\u00ebl]], [[Hans Hartung]], [[Serge Poliakoff]], and [[Georges Mathieu]], among several others. During the early 1950s [[Jean Dubuffet|Dubuffet]] (who was always a figurative artist), and [[Nicolas de Sta\u00ebl|de Sta\u00ebl]], abandoned abstraction, and returned to imagery via figuration and landscape. De Sta\u00ebl 's work was quickly recognised within the post-war art world, and he became one of the most influential artists of the 1950s. His return to representation (seascapes, footballers, jazz musicians, seagulls) during the early 1950s can be seen as an influential precedent for the American [[Bay Area Figurative Movement]], as many of those abstract painters like [[Richard Diebenkorn]], [[David Park (painter)|David Park]], [[Elmer Bischoff]], [[Wayne Thiebaud]], [[Nathan Oliveira]], [[Joan Brown]] and others made a similar move; returning to imagery during the mid-1950s. Much of de Sta\u00ebl 's late work \u2013 in particular his thinned, and diluted oil on canvas abstract landscapes of the mid-1950s predicts Color Field painting and [[Lyrical Abstraction]] of the 1960s and 1970s.

The Bay Area Figurative Movement of whom [[David Park (painter)|David Park]], [[Elmer Bischoff]], [[Nathan Oliveira]] and [[Richard Diebenkorn]] whose painting ''Cityscape 1'', 1963 is a typical example were influential members flourished during the 1950s and 1960s in California. Although throughout the 20th century painters continued to practice [[Realism (visual arts)|Realism]] and use imagery, practicing landscape and figurative painting with contemporary subjects and solid technique, and unique expressivity like [[Milton Avery]], [[Edward Hopper]], [[Jean Dubuffet]], [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]], [[Frank Auerbach]], [[Lucian Freud]], [[Philip Pearlstein]], and others. Younger painters practiced the use of imagery in new and radical ways. [[Yves Klein]], [[Martial Raysse]], [[Niki de Saint Phalle]], [[Wolf Vostell]], [[David Hockney]], [[Alex Katz]], [[Malcolm Morley]], [[Ralph Goings]], [[Audrey Flack]], [[Richard Estes]], [[Chuck Close]], [[Susan Rothenberg]], [[Eric Fischl]], [[John Baeder]] and [[Vija Celmins]] were a few who became prominent between the 1960s and the 1980s. [[Fairfield Porter]] was largely self-taught, and produced representational work in the midst of the [[abstract expressionism|Abstract Expressionist]] movement. His subjects were primarily landscapes, domestic interiors and portraits of family, friends and fellow artists, many of them affiliated with the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] of writers, including [[John Ashbery]], [[Frank O'Hara]], and [[James Schuyler]]. Many of his paintings were set in or around the family summer house on [[Great Spruce Head Island, Maine]].\n\nAlso during the 1960s and 1970s, there was a reaction against painting. Critics like Douglas Crimp viewed the work of artists like [[Ad Reinhardt]], and declared the \"death of painting\". Artists began to practice new ways of making art. New movements gained prominence some of which are: [[Fluxus]], [[Happening]], [[Video art]], [[Installation art]] [[Mail art]], the [[situationists]], [[Conceptual art]], [[Postminimalism]], [[Earth art]], [[arte povera]], [[performance art]] and [[body art]] among others.<ref>Douglas Crimp, ''The End of Painting'', October, Vol. 16, Spring, 1981, pp. 69-86</ref><ref>Douglas Crimp, ''On the Museum's Ruins'', Cambridge, Mass., 1993</ref>\n\nNeo-Dada is also a movement that started 1n the 1950s and 1960s and was related to Abstract expressionism only with imagery. Featuring the emergence of combined manufactured items, with artist materials, moving away from previous conventions of painting. This trend in art is exemplified by the work of [[Jasper Johns]] and [[Robert Rauschenberg]], whose \"combines\" in the 1950s were forerunners of Pop Art and [[Installation art]], and made use of the assemblage of large physical objects, including stuffed animals, birds and commercial photography. [[Robert Rauschenberg]], [[Jasper Johns]], [[Larry Rivers]], [[John Chamberlain (sculptor)|John Chamberlain]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[George Segal (artist)|George Segal]], [[Jim Dine]], and [[Edward Kienholz]] among others were important pioneers of both abstraction and Pop Art; creating new conventions of art-making; they made acceptable in serious contemporary art circles the radical inclusion of unlikely materials as parts of their works of art.\n\n====New abstraction from the 1950s through the 1980s====\n<!-- NOTE TO EDITORS: DO NOT ADD YOUR OWN NAME TO THIS LIST! -->\n<gallery widths=\"140px\" heights=\"140px\" perrow=\"4\">\n[[Image:Frankenthaler Helen Mountains and Sea 1952.jpg|[[Helen Frankenthaler]] 1952, [[Color Field]] painting]]\n\n\nImage:IKB 191.jpg|[[Yves Klein]], 1962, [[Monochrome painting]]\nImage:Josef Albers's painting 'Homage to the Square', 1965.jpg|[[Josef Albers]] 1965, [[Geometric abstraction]]\nImage:Newman-Who's Afraid of Red, Yellow and Blue.jpg|[[Barnett Newman]], 1966, [[Color Field]] \u2013 [[Minimalism]]\n\n</gallery>\n[[Color Field painting]] clearly pointed toward a new direction in American painting, away from [[abstract expressionism]]. Color Field painting is related to [[post-painterly abstraction]], [[suprematism]], [[abstract expressionism]], [[hard-edge painting]] and [[Lyrical Abstraction]].\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s abstract painting continued to develop in America through varied styles. [[Geometric abstraction]], Op art, [[hard-edge painting]], Color Field painting and [[Minimalism|minimal]] painting, were some interrelated directions for advanced abstract painting as well as some other new movements. [[Morris Louis]] was an important pioneer in advanced [[Color Field]] painting, his work can serve as a bridge between [[abstract expressionism]], Color Field painting, and [[minimal art]]. Two influential teachers [[Josef Albers]] and [[Hans Hofmann]] introduced a new generation of American artists to their advanced theories of color and space. [[Josef Albers]] is best remembered for his work as a [[Geometric abstraction]]ist painter and theorist. Most famous of all are the hundreds of paintings and prints that make up the series ''Homage to the Square''. In this rigorous series, begun in 1949, Albers explored chromatic interactions with flat colored squares arranged concentrically on the canvas. Albers' theories on art and education were formative for the next generation of artists. His own paintings form the foundation of both [[hard-edge painting]] and Op art.\n\n[[Josef Albers]], [[Hans Hofmann]], [[Ilya Bolotowsky]], [[Burgoyne Diller]], [[Victor Vasarely]], [[Bridget Riley]], [[Richard Anuszkiewicz]], [[Frank Stella]], [[Morris Louis]], [[Kenneth Noland]],<ref>{{cite web |first=Terry |last=Fenton |title=Online essay about Kenneth Noland, and acrylic paint |url=http://www.sharecom.ca/noland/materials |accessdate=30 April 2007}}</ref> [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Larry Poons]], [[Ronald Davis]], [[Larry Zox]], [[Al Held]] and some others like [[Mino Argento]],<ref>Noel, Frackman \"Mino Argento create. These canvases in which geometric forms, squares, arcs, and lines\", Arts Magazine p.19 December 1979</ref> are artists closely associated with [[Geometric abstraction]], Op art, Color Field painting, and in the case of Hofmann and Newman Abstract expressionism as well.\n\nIn 1965, an exhibition called ''[[The Responsive Eye]]'', curated by William C. Seitz, was held at the [[Museum of Modern Art]], in New York City. The works shown were wide ranging, encompassing the [[Minimalism]] of [[Frank Stella]], the Op art of Larry Poons, the work of [[Alexander Liberman]], alongside the masters of the Op Art movement: [[Victor Vasarely]], [[Richard Anuszkiewicz]], Bridget Riley and others. The exhibition focused on the perceptual aspects of art, which result both from the illusion of movement and the interaction of color relationships. Op art, also known as optical art, is a style present in some paintings and other works of art that use [[optical illusion]]s. Op art is also closely akin to [[geometric abstraction]] and [[hard-edge painting]]. Although sometimes the term used for it is perceptual abstraction.\n\nOp art is a method of painting concerning the interaction between illusion and picture plane, between understanding and seeing.<ref>John Lancaster. ''Introducing Op Art'', London: BT Batsford Ltd, 1973, p. 28.</ref> Op art works are abstract, with many of the better known pieces made in only black and white. When the viewer looks at them, the impression is given of movement, hidden images, flashing and vibration, patterns, or alternatively, of swelling or warping.\n\nColor Field painting sought to rid art of superfluous rhetoric. Artists like [[Clyfford Still]], [[Mark Rothko]], [[Hans Hofmann]], [[Morris Louis]], [[Jules Olitski]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Helen Frankenthaler]], [[John Hoyland]], [[Larry Zox]], and others often used greatly reduced references to nature, and they painted with a highly articulated and psychological use of color. In general these artists eliminated recognizable imagery. Certain artists quoted references to past or present art, but in general color field painting presents abstraction as an end in itself. In pursuing this direction of [[modern art]], artists wanted to present each painting as one unified, cohesive, monolithic image.\n\n[[Frank Stella]], [[Kenneth Noland]], [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Barnett Newman]], [[Ronald Davis]], [[Neil Williams (artist)|Neil Williams]], [[Robert Mangold]], [[Charles Hinman]], [[Richard Tuttle]], David Novros, and Al Loving are examples of artists associated with the use of the [[shaped canvas]] during the period beginning in the early 1960s. Many [[Geometric abstract art]]ists, [[minimalism|minimalists]], and [[Hard-edge]] painters elected to use the edges of the image to define the shape of the painting rather than accepting the rectangular format. In fact, the use of the [[shaped canvas]] is primarily associated with paintings of the 1960s and 1970s that are coolly [[abstract art|abstract]], formalistic, geometrical, objective, rationalistic, clean-lined, brashly sharp-edged, or [[minimalist]] in character. The Andre Emmerich Gallery, the [[Leo Castelli]] Gallery, the Richard Feigen Gallery, and the [[Park Place Gallery]] were important showcases for [[Color Field]] painting, [[shaped canvas]] painting and [[Lyrical Abstraction]] in New York City during the 1960s. There is a connection with [[post-painterly abstraction]], which reacted against [[abstract expressionism]]s' mysticism, hyper-subjectivity, and emphasis on making the act of painting itself dramatically visible \u2013 as well as the solemn acceptance of the flat rectangle as an almost ritual prerequisite for serious painting. During the 1960s Color Field painting and [[Minimal art]] were often closely associated with each other. In actuality by the early 1970s both movements became decidedly diverse.\n\n====Washington Color School, Shaped Canvas, Abstract Illusionism, Lyrical Abstraction====\n<gallery widths=\"140px\" heights=\"140px\" perrow=\"4\">\nImage:Ring of Ronald Davis.jpg|[[Ronald Davis]] 1968, [[Abstract Illusionism]]\nImage:Forwilliamblake.jpg|[[Ronnie Landfield]], 1968, [[Lyrical Abstraction]]\n</gallery>\nAnother related movement of the late 1960s, [[Lyrical Abstraction]] (the term being coined by Larry Aldrich, the founder of the [[Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum]], Ridgefield Connecticut), encompassed what Aldrich said he saw in the studios of many artists at that time.<ref>Aldrich, Larry.

Direct drawing, calligraphic use of line, the effects of brushed, splattered, stained, squeegeed, poured, and splashed paint superficially resemble the effects seen in abstract expressionism and color field painting. However, the styles are markedly different. Setting it apart from [[abstract expressionism]] and [[action painting]] of the 1940s and 1950s is the approach to composition and drama. As seen in action painting there is an emphasis on brushstrokes, high compositional drama, dynamic compositional tension. While in Lyrical Abstraction there is a sense of compositional randomness, all over composition, low key and relaxed compositional drama and an emphasis on process, repetition, and an all over sensibility.,<ref>The Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art, ''Lyrical Abstraction'', exhibition: 5 April through 7 June 1970</ref><ref>''Lyrical Abstraction'' Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, 25 May \u2013 6 July 1971</ref>\n\n====Hard-edge painting, minimalism, postminimalism, monochrome painting====\n<gallery widths=\"140px\" heights=\"140px\" perrow=\"4\">\nImage:Robert Mangold's acrylic and pencil 'X Within X Orange', 1981.jpg|[[Robert Mangold]] 1981, [[Minimalism]]\nImage:'Red Canvas' by Richard Tuttle, 1967, Corcoran Gallery of Art.jpg|[[Richard Tuttle]], 1967, [[Postminimalism]]\nImage:The Dylan Painting.jpg|[[Brice Marden]], 1966/1986, [[Monochrome painting]]\n</gallery>\n\n[[Agnes Martin]], [[Robert Mangold]], [[Brice Marden]], [[Jo Baer]], [[Robert Ryman]], [[Richard Tuttle]], [[Neil Williams (artist)|Neil Williams]], David Novros, Paul Mogenson, [[Charles Hinman]] are examples of artists associated with [[Minimalism]] and (exceptions of Martin, Baer and Marden) the use of the [[shaped canvas]] also during the period beginning in the early 1960s.

Artists as diverse as Agnes Martin, Al Held, [[Larry Zox]], [[Frank Stella]], [[Larry Poons]], [[Brice Marden]] and others explored the power of simplification. The convergence of [[Color Field]] painting, [[minimal art]], hard-edge painting, [[Lyrical Abstraction]], and postminimalism blurred the distinction between movements that became more apparent in the 1980s and 1990s. The [[neo-expressionism]] movement is related to earlier developments in [[abstract expressionism]], [[neo-Dada]], Lyrical Abstraction and postminimal painting.\n\n====Neo Expressionism====\n<!-- NOTE TO EDITORS: DO NOT ADD YOUR OWN NAME TO THIS LIST! -->\n<gallery widths=\"140px\" heights=\"140px\" perrow=\"4\">\n\n</gallery>\n\nIn the late 1960s the [[abstract expressionist]] painter [[Philip Guston]] helped to lead a transition from abstract expressionism to [[Neo-expressionism]] in painting, abandoning the so-called \"pure abstraction\" of abstract expressionism in favor of more cartoonish renderings of various personal symbols and objects. These works were inspirational to a new generation of painters interested in a revival of expressive imagery. His painting ''Painting, Smoking, Eating'' 1973, seen above in the gallery is an example of Guston's final and conclusive return to representation.\n\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, there was also a return to painting that occurred almost simultaneously in Italy, Germany, France and [[UK|Britain]]. These movements were called [[Transavantguardia]], [[Neue Wilde]], [[Figuration Libre]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tate.org.uk/collections/glossary/definition.jsp?entryId=188 |title=Tate online glossary }}</ref> [[Neo-expressionism]], the school of London, and in the late 1980s the [[Stuckists]] respectively. These painting were characterized by large formats, free expressive mark making, figuration, myth and imagination. All work in this genre came to be labeled [[neo-expressionism]]. Critical reaction was divided. Some critics regarded it as driven by profit motivations by large commercial galleries. This type of art continues in popularity into the 21st century, even after the art crash of the late 1980s. [[Anselm Kiefer]] is a leading figure in European [[Neo-expressionism]] by the 1980s, Kiefer's themes widened from a focus on Germany's role in civilization to the fate of art and culture in general. His work became more sculptural and involves not only national identity and collective memory, but also [[occult]] [[symbol]]ism, [[theology]] and [[mysticism]]. The theme of all the work is the trauma experienced by entire societies, and the continual rebirth and renewal in life.\n\nDuring the late 1970s in the United States painters who began working with invigorated surfaces and who returned to imagery like [[Susan Rothenberg]] gained in popularity, especially as seen above in paintings like ''Horse 2'', 1979. During the 1980s American artists like [[Eric Fischl]], [[David Salle]], [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]] (who began as a [[graffiti artist]]), [[Julian Schnabel]], and [[Keith Haring]], and Italian painters like [[Mimmo Paladino]], [[Sandro Chia]], and [[Enzo Cucchi]], among others defined the idea of [[Neo-expressionism]] in America.\n\nNeo-expressionism was a style of [[Modernism|modern]] painting that became popular in the late 1970s and dominated the art market until the mid-1980s. It developed in Europe as a reaction against the conceptual and [[minimalism|minimalistic]] art of the 1960s and 1970s. Neo-expressionists returned to portraying recognizable objects, such as the human body (although sometimes in a virtually abstract manner), in a rough and violently emotional way using vivid colours and banal colour harmonies. The veteran painters [[Philip Guston]], [[Frank Auerbach]], [[Leon Kossoff]], [[Gerhard Richter]], [[A. R. Penck]] and [[Georg Baselitz]], along with slightly younger artists like [[Anselm Kiefer]], [[Eric Fischl]], [[Susan Rothenberg]], [[Francesco Clemente]], [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]], [[Julian Schnabel]], [[Keith Haring]], and many others became known for working in this intense expressionist vein of painting.\n\nPainting still holds a respected position in [[contemporary art]]. Art is an open field no longer divided by the objective versus non-objective dichotomy. Artists can achieve critical success whether their images are representational or abstract. What has currency is content, exploring the boundaries of the medium, and a refusal to recapitulate the works of the past as an end goal.\n\n====Contemporary painting into the 21st century====\n{{main|Contemporary art|Postmodern art|Late Modernism}}\n<!--\n<gallery widths=\"140px\" heights=\"140px\" perrow=\"4\">\n[[Image:La scienza della laziness (The Science of Laziness) by Frank Stella, 1984, oil, enamel and alkyd paint on canvas, etched magnesium, aluminum and fiberglass, National Gallery of Art (Washington, D.

Pictorial activity was reduced to [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|Arabesque]], mainly [[Abstract art|abstract]], with [[geometrical]] configuration or floral and plant-like patterns. Strongly connected to architecture and [[calligraphy]], it can be widely seen as used for the painting of [[tile]]s in mosques or in illuminations around the text of the Koran and other books. In fact, abstract art is not an invention of modern art but it is present in [[pre-classical]], [[barbarian]] and non-western cultures many centuries before it and is essentially a decorative or [[applied art]]. Notable illustrator [[M. C. Escher]] was influenced by this geometrical and pattern-based art. [[Art Nouveau]] ([[Aubrey Beardsley]] and the architect [[Antonio Gaud\u00ed]]) re-introduced abstract floral patterns into western art.\n\nNote that despite the taboo of figurative visualization, some Muslim countries did cultivate a rich tradition in painting, though not in its own right, but as a companion to the written word. Iranian or Persian art, widely known as Persian miniature, concentrates on the illustration of epic or romantic works of literature. Persian illustrators deliberately avoided the use of shading and perspective, though familiar with it in their pre-Islamic history, in order to abide by the rule of not creating any lifelike illusion of the real world. Their aim was not to depict the world as it is, but to create images of an ideal world of timeless beauty and perfect order.\n\nIn present days, painting by art students or professional artists in Arab and non-Arab Muslim countries follows the same tendencies of Western culture art.\n\n===Iran===\n{{main|Persian painting|Persian calligraphy|List of Persian painters|Iranian art}}\nOriental historian Basil Gray believes \"Iran has offered a particularly unique {{sic}} art to the world which is excellent in its kind\". Caves in Iran's Lorestan province exhibit painted imagery of animals and hunting scenes. Some such as those in Fars Province and Sialk are at least 5,000 years old. Painting in Iran is thought to have reached a climax during the Tamerlane era, when outstanding masters such as Kamaleddin Behzad gave birth to a new style of painting.\n\nPaintings of the Qajar period are a combination of European influences and Safavid miniature schools of painting such as those introduced by [[Reza Abbasi]] and classical works by [[Mihr 'Ali]]. Masters such as [[Kamal-ol-molk]] further pushed forward the European influence in Iran. It was during the Qajar era when \"Coffee House painting\" emerged. Subjects of this style were often religious in nature depicting scenes from Shia epics and the like.\n<gallery widths=\"140px\" heights=\"140px\" perrow=\"4\">\nImage:Babur-drunken.jpg|[[Farrukh Beg]] (ca. 1545 \u2013 ca. 1615), ''A Drunken [[Babur]] Returns to Camp at Night'', [[Lahore]], Pakistan, 1589\nFile:Fath_Ali_Shah(Saad_Abad).jpg|[[Mihr 'Ali]] (fl. 1795\u20131830), ''Fat'h Ali Shah Qajar'' (1813\u201314)\nFile:Rammal by Kamalolmolk.jpg|[[Kamal-ol-molk]] (1847\u20131940), ''Predictor of the Future'', 1892, Museum of Sadabad, [[Teheran]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Pakistan===\n{{main|Culture of Pakistan}}\n<gallery widths=\"140px\" heights=\"140px\" perrow=\"4\">\nImage:LAgha_Star.jpg|[[Lubna Agha]], ''Star'' \u2013 a painting inspired by the artisans of Morocco\nImage:Anarkali.jpg|[[Abdur Rahman Chughtai|AR Chughtai]], ''Anarkali''\n</gallery>\n\n==Oceania==\n{{main|Art of Oceania}}\n\n===Australia===\n{{main|Aboriginal art|Art of Australia|List of Australian artists|Visual arts of Australia}}\n\n===New Zealand===\n{{main|Art of New Zealand|List of New Zealand artists}}\n\n==Africa==\n{{main|African art|African tribal masks|Tingatinga (painting)}}\n\n<gallery widths=\"140px\" heights=\"140px\" perrow=\"4\">\nImage:Himba_lady_preparing_deodorant.jpg|[[Himba people|Himba]] woman covered with traditional [[red ochre]] [[pigment]].

[[Contemporary art|contemporary]]\n</gallery>\n\nAfrican traditional culture and tribes do not seem to have great interest in two-dimensional representations in favour of sculpture and [[relief]]. However, decorative painting in African culture is often abstract and geometrical. Another pictorial manifestation is [[body painting]], and [[face painting]] present for example in [[Maasai people|Maasai]] and [[K\u0129k\u0169y\u0169]] culture in their ceremony rituals. Ceremonial [[cave painting]] in certain villages can be found to be still in use. Note that [[Pablo Picasso]] and other modern artists were influenced by [[African sculpture]] and [[masks]] in their varied styles.\nContemporary African artists follow western art movements and their paintings have little difference from occidental art works.\n\n===Sudanese===\n[[File:Prince Arikankharer Slaying His Enemies, Meroitic, beginning of first century AD, sandstone - Worcester Art Museum - IMG 7535.JPG|thumb|Traces of paint on a relief depicting Prince [[Arikhankharer]] smiting his enemies, from the [[Meroitic period]] of the [[Kingdom of Kush]], early 1st century AD]]\n\nThe [[Kingdom of Kush]] in ancient [[Nubia]] (i.e. modern [[Sudan]]), bordering [[Ancient Egypt]], produced a wide variety of arts, including wall paintings and painted objects.

It is the [[official language]] of  Hungary and one of the 24 official languages of the [[European Union]]. Outside Hungary it is also spoken by communities of [[Hungarian people|Hungarians]] in the countries that today make up [[Slovakia]], western [[Ukraine]] ([[Zakarpattia Oblast|Subcarpathia]]), central and western [[Romania]] ([[Transylvania]]), northern [[Serbia]] ([[Vojvodina]]), northern [[Croatia]], and northern [[Slovenia]] ([[Prekmurje|Mur region]]). It is also spoken by Hungarian [[diaspora]] communities worldwide, especially in [[North America]] (particularly the [[Hungarian Americans|United States]] and Canada) and in Israel. Like [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Estonian language|Estonian]], Hungarian belongs to the [[Uralic languages|Uralic language family]].\n\n==Classification==\n{{See also|Regular sound correspondences between Hungarian and other Uralic languages}}\nHungarian is a member of the [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] language family. Linguistic connections between Hungarian and other Uralic languages were noticed in the 1670s, and the family itself (then called Finno-Ugric) was established in 1717, but the classification of Hungarian as a Uralic/Finno-Ugric rather than Turkic language continued to be a matter of impassioned political controversy throughout the 18th and into the 19th centuries. Hungarian has traditionally been assigned to an [[Ugric languages|Ugric]] branch within Uralic/Finno-Ugric, along with the [[Mansi language|Mansi]] and [[Khanty language|Khanty]] languages of western [[Siberia]] ([[Khanty\u2013Mansia]] region), but it is no longer clear that it is a valid group.  When the [[Samoyed languages]] were determined to be part of the family, it was thought at first that Finnic and Ugric (Finno-Ugric) were closer to each other than to the Samoyed branch of the family, but that now is frequently questioned.<ref name=\"SalmTax\">[http://www.helsinki.fi/~tasalmin/kuzn.html Salminen, Tapani (2002): ''Problems in the taxonomy of the Uralic languages in the light of modern comparative studies'']</ref><ref>Michalove, Peter A. (2002) The Classification of the Uralic Languages: Lexical Evidence from Finno-Ugric. In: Finnisch-Ugrische Forschungen, vol. 57</ref>\n\nThe [[name of Hungary]] could be a result of regular sound changes of ''Ungrian/Ugrian'', and the fact that the Eastern Slavs referred to Hungarians as ''\u01eagry/\u01eagrove'' (sg. ''\u01eagrin\u016d'') seemed to confirm that.<ref>{{Citation | last = Lebedynsky | first = Iaroslav | language = French | title = Les Nomades: Les peuples nomades de la steppe des origines aux invasions mongoles |trans-title=The Nomads: the steppe nomad people from origins to Mongol invasions | page = 191}}.</ref> Current literature favors the hypothesis that it comes from the name of the Turkic tribe [[Onogurs|Onogur]] (which means \"ten arrows\" or \"ten tribes\").<ref>Sugar, P.F..''A History of Hungary''.

''The Uralic Language Family: Facts, Myths and Statistics''. Blackwell Publishing, 2002: p. 19</ref>'''\n\nThere are numerous regular sound correspondences between Hungarian and the other Ugric languages. For example, Hungarian {{IPA|/a\u02d0/}} corresponds to [[Khanty language|Khanty]] {{IPA|/o/}} in certain positions, and Hungarian {{IPA|/h/}} corresponds to Khanty {{IPA|/x/}}, while Hungarian final {{IPA|/z/}} corresponds to Khanty final {{IPA|/t/}}. For example, Hungarian ''h\u00e1z'' {{IPA-hu|ha\u02d0z|}} \"house\" vs. Khanty ''xot'' {{IPA|[xot]}} \"house\", and Hungarian ''sz\u00e1z'' {{IPA|[sa\u02d0z]}} \"hundred\" vs. Khanty ''sot'' {{IPA|[sot]}} \"hundred\". The distance between the Ugric and Finnic languages is greater, but the correspondences are also regular.\n\n=== Early classification ===\nDuring the latter half of the 19th century, a competing hypothesis proposed a Turkic affinity of Hungarian. Following an academic debate known as ''Az ugor-t\u00f6r\u00f6k h\u00e1bor\u00fa'' (\"the Ugric-Turkic battle\"), the Finno-Ugric hypothesis was concluded the sounder of the two, foremost based on work by the German [[linguist]] {{Interlanguage link multi|Josef Budenz|de}}.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Linguistica Uralica|issue=2/2001|author1-first=Angela|author1-last=Marcantonio|author2-first=Pirjo|author2-last=Nummenaho|author3-first=Michela|author3-last=Salvagni|url=http://www.kirj.ee/public/va_lu/l37-2-1.pdf|format=PDF|title=The \"Ugric-Turkic Battle\": A Critical Review|accessdate=8 October 2017|year=2001}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Main article |History of the Hungarian language}}\n\n===Prehistory===\n====Scholarly consensus====\nThe traditional view holds that the Hungarian language diverged from its [[Ugric languages|Ugric]] relatives in the first half of the [[1st millennium BC|1st millennium {{smallcaps|b.c.}}]], in western [[Siberia]] east of the southern [[Ural mountains|Urals]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Uralic Languages |last= Abondolo |first=Daniel |publisher=Routledge |year=1998 |location=London |pages=1\u201342 |chapter=Introduction}}</ref> The [[Hungarians]] gradually changed their lifestyle from being settled hunters to being [[Nomadic pastoralism|nomadic pastoralists]], probably as a result of early contacts with Iranian nomads ([[Scythians]] and [[Sarmatians]]).

After analysis of the plant pollens in the supposed homeland of the Magyars, which were preserved in the soil, it became clear to scientists that the [[taiga]] and [[deciduous forest]]s were only in contact during the second millennium B.C.E., which is much too late to affect Finno-Ugrian history. So the territory sought by the linguists as the location of the putative \u2018ancient homeland\u2019 never existed. At 5,000-6,000 B.C.E., the period at which the Uralic era has been dated, the taiga was still thousands of kilometres away from the Ural mountains and the mixed deciduous forest had only just begun its northward advance.\u201d</ref>\n\n[[Geneticist]] Endre Nepar\u00e1czki  argues that the Hungarian conquerors of the late 9th century were in fact [[Huns|Hunnic tribes]].<ref>{{cite biorxiv |last=Nepar\u00e1czki |first=E |display-authors=etal |date=2016-12-07 |biorxiv=092239 |title=Revising mtDNA haplotypes of the ancient Hungarian conquerors with next generation sequencing}}</ref><ref name='Neparacki'>Endre Neparacki, [http://doktori.bibl.u-szeged.hu/3794/1/Neparaczki_PhD.pdf A honfoglal\u00f3k genetikai sz\u00e1rmaz\u00e1s\u00e1nak \u00e9s rokons\u00e1gi viszonyainak vizsg\u00e1lata archeogenetikai m\u00f3dszerekkel], ELTE TTK Biol\u00f3gia Doktori Iskola, 2017, p. 69</ref> Given the fact that the Magyars are traditionally believed to have brought the Hungarian language into the Carpathian Basin, Nepar\u00e1czki's hypothesis would seem to imply that the Huns must have spoken Hungarian.<ref name='Neparacki'/> The chief difficulty with this proposition is that [[paleogenetics|paleogenetic]] research on its own can neither prove nor disprove the origins of languages.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nN\u00e1ndor Dreisziger holds that the Hungarian language may have been spoken by the late [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]] and that [[\u00c1rp\u00e1d]]'s Magyars were a Turkic-speaking elite who ruled over a Finno-Ugric, proto-Hungarian-speaking population during the migrations.<ref>Dreisziger, N\u00e1ndor. \u201c\u00c1rmin V\u00e1mb\u00e9ry (1832-1913) as a Historian of Hungarian Settlement in the Carpathian Basin.\u201d AHEA: E-Journal of the American Hungarian Educators Association, Volume 6 (2013) [http://ahea.net/e-journal/volume-6-2013/6?&request=modules/journals/journalarticleattachments&download=240&ajax=1]</ref>\n\n====Controversy over origins====\nToday the [[scientific consensus|consensus]] among [[linguist]]s is that Hungarian is a member of the [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] family of languages.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nFor many years, however, it was a matter of dispute whether Hungarian was a [[Finno-Ugric languages|Finno-Ugric]]/[[Uralic language]] or more closely related to the [[Turkic languages]] (a controversy known as the \"[[Ugric\u2013Turkish war]]\")<ref>elanguage.net/journals/pragmatics/article/download/205/144</ref>\u2014or whether indeed both the Uralic and the Turkic families formed part of a [[superfamily (linguistics)|superfamily]] of [[Ural\u2013Altaic languages]]. Hungarians did in fact absorb some Turkic influences during several centuries of cohabitation. For example, the Hungarians appear to have learned [[animal husbandry]] techniques from the Turkic [[Chuvash people]], as a high proportion of words specific to [[agriculture]] and [[livestock]] are of Chuvash origin. A strong Chuvash influence was also apparent in Hungarian [[burial]] customs.

Budapest, 1943.</ref>\n\n===Old Hungarian===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}\nThe first written accounts of Hungarian, mostly [[personal name]] and [[place name]]s, date to the 10th century. No significant texts written in [[Old Hungarian script]] have survived, as wood, the [[writing material|medium of writing]] in use at the time, was perishable.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nThe [[Kingdom of Hungary]] was founded in 1000 by [[Stephen I of Hungary|Stephen I]]. The country became a [[Western culture|Western]]-styled [[Christian]] ([[Roman Catholic]]) state, with [[Latin script]] replacing Hungarian runes. The earliest remaining fragments of the language are found in the [[establishing charter of the abbey of Tihany]] from 1055, intermingled with [[Latin language|Latin]] text. The first extant text fully written in Hungarian is the [[Funeral Sermon and Prayer]], which dates to the 1190s. Although the [[orthography]] of these early texts differed considerably from that used today, contemporary Hungarians can still understand a great deal of the reconstructed spoken language, despite changes in grammar and vocabulary.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nA more extensive body of [[Hungarian literature]] arose after 1300. The earliest known example of Hungarian [[Christian poetry|religious poetry]] is the 14th-century ''[[Lamentations of Mary]]''. The first [[Bible translation]] was the [[Hussite Bible]] in the 1430s.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nThe standard language lost its [[diphthongs]], and several [[postposition]]s transformed into [[suffix]]es, including ''re\u00e1'' \"onto\" (the phrase ''utu '''rea''''' \"onto the way\" found in the 1055 text would later become ''\u00fat'''ra'''''). There were also changes in the system of [[vowel harmony]]. At one time, Hungarian used six [[verb]] [[Grammatical tense|tenses]]. Today, only two are commonly used (present and past); the future is formed with an [[auxiliary verb]] and is usually not counted as a separate tense.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\n===Modern Hungarian===\n[[File:Esztergom Jord\u00e1nszky-k\u00f3dex.JPG|thumb|The [[Bible]] in Hungarian]]\n\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}\n\nIn 1533, [[Krak\u00f3w]] [[printing press|printer]] [[Benedek Komj\u00e1ti]] published the first Hungarian-language book set in [[movable type]], a translation of the [[Pauline letters|letters of Saint Paul]] entitled ''Az zenth Paal leueley magyar nyeluen'' (modern orthography: ''Az Szent P\u00e1l levelei magyar nyelven'').{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nBy the 17th century, the language already closely resembled its present-day form, although two of the past tenses remained in use. [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[French language|French]] loans also began to appear.

Some words were shortened (''gy\u0151zedelem'' > ''gy\u0151zelem'', 'triumph' or 'victory'); a number of [[dialect]]al words spread nationally (''e.g.'', ''cselleng'' 'dawdle'); extinct words were reintroduced (''d\u00edsz'', 'd\u00e9cor'); a wide range of expressions were [[neologism|coined]] using the various derivative suffixes; and some other, less frequently used methods of expanding the language were utilized. This movement produced more than ten thousand words, most of which are used actively today.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nThe 19th and 20th centuries saw further [[Standard language#Standardization|standardization]] of the language, and differences between [[mutually comprehensible]] dialects gradually diminished.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nIn 1920, Hungary signed the [[Treaty of Trianon]], losing 71 percent of its territory and one-third of the ethnic Hungarian population along with it.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nToday the language holds [[official language|official]] status nationally in Hungary and regionally in [[Hungarian minority in Romania|Romania]], [[Hungarians in Slovakia|Slovakia]], [[Hungarians in Vojvodina|Serbia]], [[Hungarians in Austria|Austria]] and [[Slovenia]].{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\n==Geographic distribution==\n[[File:Hungarian language in Transylvania.svg|thumb|upright=1.36|Areas of [[Transylvania]] where Hungarian has co-official status (areas in which at least 20% of the population is Hungarian)]]\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Country!!Speakers!!Notes\n|-\n|[[Hungary]]||align=\"right\"| 9,896,333 ||(2011)<ref name=\"Hungarian census\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ksh.hu/nepszamlalas/tablak_teruleti_00|title=K\u00f6zponti Statisztikai Hivatal|website=Ksh.hu|accessdate=8 October 2017}}</ref> \n|-\n|[[Romania]]<br><small>(mainly [[Transylvania]])</small>||align=\"right\"| 1,268,444 ||(2011)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.recensamantromania.ro/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/TS5.pdf|title=Romanian census 2011|website=Recensamantromania.ro|accessdate=8 October 2017}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[Slovakia]]<ref group=\"note\">This number is a lower estimate, as 382,493 people (7.0% of the total population) did not specify their mother tongue.</ref>||align=\"right\"|458 467|| (2011)<ref>[http://portal.statistics.sk/showdoc.do?docid=50553 Slovak census 2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114081722/http://portal.statistics.sk/showdoc.do?docid=50553 |date=2012-11-14 }}</ref>\n|-\n|[[Serbia]]<br><small>(mainly [[Vojvodina]])</small>||align=\"right\"|241,164|| (2011)<ref>[[Languages of Vojvodina]]</ref>{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=January 2018}}\n|-\n|[[Ukraine]] <br><small>(mainly [[Zakarpattia Oblast|Zakarpattia]])</small>||align=\"right\"|149,400 ||(2001)<ref>[http://www.ukrcensus.gov.ua/eng/results/general/language/ Ukrainian census 2001]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820175518/http://www.ukrcensus.gov.ua/eng/results/general/language/ |date=August 20, 2010 }}</ref>\n|-\n|[[United States]]||align=\"right\"|117,973 ||(2000)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/QTTable?_bm=y&-geo_id=01000US&-qr_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U_QTP16&-ds_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U|title=American FactFinder - Results|first=U.S. Census|last=Bureau|website=factfinder.census.gov|accessdate=8 October 2017}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[Canada]]||align=\"right\"|75,555 ||(2001)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census01/products/standard/themes/RetrieveProductTable.cfm?Temporal=2001&PID=55670&APATH=3&GID=431515&METH=1&PTYPE=55430&THEME=41&FOCUS=0&AID=0&PLACENAME=0&PROVINCE=0&SEARCH=0&GC=0&GK=0&VID=0&FL=0&RL=0&FREE=0|title=File Not Found|website=12.statcan.ca|accessdate=8 October 2017}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[Israel]]||align=\"right\"|70,000||\n|-\n|[[Austria]] <br><small>(mainly [[Burgenland]])</small>||align=\"right\"|22,000||\n|-\n|[[Australia]] <br><small></small>||align=\"right\"|20,883||2011<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sbs.com.au/censusexplorer/|title=SBS Census Explorer|website=Sbs.com.au|accessdate=8 October 2017}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[Croatia]]||align=\"right\"|16,500||\n|-\n|[[Slovenia]]<br><small>(mainly [[Prekmurje]])</small>||align=\"right\"|9,240||\n|-\n|'''Total''' ||'''12\u201313 million'''||\n|}\n:''Source: National censuses, [[Ethnologue]]''\n\nHungarian has about 13 million<ref name=Ethnologue>{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/language/hun|title=Hungarian|website=Ethnologue.com|accessdate=8 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vpNOCLJImNkC&pg=PA9 |title=Hungarian Practical Dictionary: Hungarian-English, English-Hungarian |last=Szab\u00f3 |first=\u00c9va |date=2005 |publisher=Hippocrene Books |location=New York |pages=9 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ox89vJtDfMYC&pg=PA1 |title=Hungarian-English/English-Hungarian: Dictionary & Phrasebook |last=Ward |first=Judit Hajnal |date=2002 |publisher=Hippocrene Books |pages=1}}</ref> native speakers, of whom more than 9.8 million live in Hungary.

These dialects are, for the most part, [[mutually intelligible]]. The Hungarian [[Cs\u00e1ng\u00f3]] dialect, which is mentioned but not listed separately by Ethnologue, is spoken primarily in [[Bac\u0103u County]] in eastern Romania. The Cs\u00e1ng\u00f3 Hungarian group has been largely isolated from other [[Hungarian people]], and they therefore preserved features that closely resemble earlier forms of Hungarian.\n\n==Phonology==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}\n[[File:Hungarian vowel chart with rounded short a.svg|right|thumb|upright=1.36|Hungarian vowels]]\n{{Main article|Hungarian phonology}}\n\nHungarian has 14 vowel phonemes and 25 consonant phonemes. The vowel phonemes can be grouped as pairs of short and long vowels such as ''o'' and ''\u00f3''. Most of the pairs have a similar pronunciation and vary significantly only in their duration.

Most consonant phonemes can occur as [[Consonant length|geminates]].\n\nThe sound [[voiced palatal plosive]] {{IPA|/\u025f/}}, written {{angle bracket|gy}}, sounds similar to 'd' in [[British English]] 'duty' (in fact, it is more similar to the [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] phoneme '\u0453' as in '\u0453\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d'). It occurs in the name of the country, \"Magyarorsz\u00e1g\" (Hungary), pronounced {{IPA|/\u02c8m\u0252\u025f\u0252rorsa\u02d0\u0261/}}.\n\nA single 'r' is pronounced as an [[alveolar tap]] (''akkora'' 'of that size'), but a double 'r' is pronounced as an [[alveolar trill]] (''akkorra'' 'by that time'), like in [[Spanish language|Spanish]].\n\n===Prosody===\nPrimary stress is always on the first [[syllable]] of a word, as in Finnish and the neighbouring [[Slovak language|Slovak]] and [[Czech language|Czech]]. There is a secondary stress on other syllables in compounds: ''viszontl\u00e1t\u00e1sra'' (\"goodbye\") is pronounced {{IPA|/\u02c8visont\u02ccla\u02d0ta\u02d0\u0283r\u0252/}}. Elongated vowels in non-initial syllables may seem to be stressed to an English-speaker, as length and stress correlate in English.\n\n==Grammar==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}\n{{Main article |Hungarian grammar}}\nHungarian, an [[agglutinative language]], uses various [[affixes]], mainly [[suffixes]] but also some [[prefixes]] and a [[circumfix]], to change a word's meaning and its grammatical function.\n\n===Vowel harmony===\nHungarian uses [[vowel harmony]] to attach suffixes to words. That means that most suffixes have two or three different forms, and the choice between them depends on the vowels of the head word. There are some minor and unpredictable exceptions to the rule.\n\n===Nouns===\nNouns have a large number of [[Grammatical case|cases]] (between 18 and 35, depending on the definition), but they are generally formed regularly with suffixes. The nominative case is unmarked (''az alma'' 'the apple') and, for example, the accusative is marked with the suffix ''\u2013t'' (''az alm\u00e1t'' '[I eat] the apple'). Half of the 18 cases express a combination of the source-location-target and surface-inside-proximity ternary distinctions (three times three cases); there is a separate case ending \u2013''b\u00f3l''/''\u2013b\u0151l'' meaning a combination of source and insideness: 'from inside of'.\n\nPossession is expressed by a possessive suffix on the possessed object, rather than the possessor as  in English (Peter's apple becomes ''P\u00e9ter alm\u00e1ja'', literally 'Peter apple-his'). Noun plurals are formed with''\u2013k'' (''az alm\u00e1k'' \u2018the apples\u2019), but after a numeral, the singular is used (''k\u00e9t alma'' \u2018two apples\u2019, literally \u2018two apple\u2019; not ''*k\u00e9t alm\u00e1k'').\n\nUnlike English, Hungarian uses case suffixes and mostly [[preposition and postposition|postpositions]], instead of prepositions.\n\nThere are two types of [[article (grammar)|articles]] in Hungarian, definite and indefinite, which roughly correspond to the equivalents in English.\n\n===Adjectives===\nAdjectives precede nouns (''a piros alma'' 'the red apple') and have three degrees: positive (''piros'' 'red'), comparative (''pirosabb'' 'redder') and superlative (''a legpirosabb'' 'the reddest').\n\nIf the noun takes the plural or a case, an attributive adjective is invariable: ''a piros alm\u00e1k'' 'the red apples'. However, a predicative adjective agrees with the noun:  ''az alm\u00e1k piros'''ak''''' 'the apples are red'. Adjectives by themselves can behave as nouns (and so can take case suffixes): ''Melyik alm\u00e1t k\u00e9red?&nbsp;\u2013 A piros'''at'''.'' 'Which apple would you like?&nbsp;\u2013 The red one'.\n\n===Verbs===\n{{See also|Hungarian verbs}}\nVerbs are conjugated according to two tenses (past and present), three moods (indicative, conditional and imperative-subjunctive), two numbers (singular or plural), three persons (first, second and third) and definiteness.\n\nThe last feature is most characteristic: the definite conjugation is used with a [[transitive verb]] whose (direct) object is definite (''P\u00e9ter eszi az alm\u00e1t''. \"Peter eats the apple\".), but the indefinite conjugation either for a verb with an indefinite direct object (''P\u00e9ter eszik egy alm\u00e1t''. \"Peter eats an apple\".) or for a verb without an object. (''P\u00e9ter eszik''. \"Peter eats\".){{Clarify|date=March 2015|reason=Does Hungarian also have the concept of indirect objects (equating in English to prepositional phrases); and if so, into which class would fall the conjugation of a verb with an indirect, definite object? (&quot;Peter watches for the apple.&quot;)}}\nSince conjugation expresses the person and number, personal pronouns are usually omitted except for emphasis.<!-- A definite object usually has the definite article before it (e.g. ''az alma'' \u2018the apple\u2019), while an indefinite has the indefinite article (''egy alma'' \u2018an apple\u2019), or does not have any articles (this is sometimes used for generalization.) -->\n\nThe [[present tense]] is unmarked, and the past is formed by using the suffix&nbsp;\u2013t or \u2013tt: ''hall'' 'hears'; ''hallott'' 'heard', past. Future may be expressed with the present tense (usually with a word defining the time of the event: ''holnap'' 'tomorrow') or by using the auxiliary verb ''fog'' (similar to the English 'will'), followed by the infinitive.\n\nThe [[indicative mood]] and the [[conditional mood]] are used both in the present and the past tenses. The conditional past is expressed by using the conjugated past form and the auxiliary word ''volna ''(''hallott volna'' 'would have heard')''.'' The [[imperative mood]] is used only in the present tense.\n\nVerbs have [[verbal prefix]]es, which are also known as [[coverb]]s. Most of them define direction of movement: ''lemegy'' \"goes down\", ''felmegy'' \"goes up\". Some verbal prefixes give an [[grammatical aspect|aspect]] to the verb, such as the prefix ''meg-'', which generally marks [[telicity]].\n\nVowel harmony also plays a major role in verb conjugations.  All Hungarian verb conjugations (as well as postpositions and possessive suffixes, for that matter) can be thought of as 'templates' into which vowels are inserted. Based on the nature of a verb's infinitive, which always ends in '-ni', one can create a generic 'template', which has mostly consonants. The vowels are then inserted into the 'template' according to the rules of vowel harmony, based on the categorization of the vowel in the verb root (front, back, rounded, unrounded).\n\n===Word order===\nThe neutral word order is [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]] (SVO). However, Hungarian, a [[topic-prominent language]], has a [[word order]] that depends not only on syntax but also on the [[topic-comment]] structure of the sentence (for example, what aspect is assumed to be known and what is emphasized).\n\nA Hungarian sentence generally has the following order: topic, comment (or focus), verb and the rest.\n\nThe topic shows that the proposition is only for that particular thing or aspect, and it implies that the proposition is not true for some others. For example, in \"''Az alm\u00e1t J\u00e1nos l\u00e1tja\".'' ('It is John who sees the apple'. Literally 'The apple John sees.'), the apple is in the topic, implying that other objects may be seen by not him but other people (the pear may be seen by Peter). The topic part may be empty.\n\nThe focus shows the new information for the listeners that may not have been known or that their knowledge must be corrected. For example, \"\u00c9n vagyok az ap\u00e1d\". ('I am your father'. Literally, 'It is I who am your father'.), from the movie ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'', the pronoun I (''\u00e9n'') is in the focus and implies that it is new information, and the listener thought that someone else is his father.\n\nAlthough Hungarian is sometimes described as having free word order, different word orders are generally not interchangeable, and the neutral order is not always correct to use. Also, the intonation is also different with different topic-comment structures. The topic usually has a rising intonation, the focus having a falling intonation. In the following examples, the topic is marked with italics, and the focus (comment) is marked with boldface.\n*J\u00e1nos l\u00e1tja az alm\u00e1t. - 'John sees the apple'. Neutral sentence.\n*''J\u00e1nos'' '''l\u00e1tja''' az alm\u00e1t. - 'John '''sees''' the apple'. (Peter may not see the apple.)\n*'''J\u00e1nos''' l\u00e1tja az ''alm\u00e1t''. - 'It is John who sees the apple'. (The listener may have thought that it is Peter.)\n*''J\u00e1nos''''' az alm\u00e1t '''l\u00e1tja. - 'What John sees is the apple'. (It is the apple, not the pear, that John specifically sees. However, Peter may see the pear.)\n*''Az alm\u00e1t''''' l\u00e1tja''' J\u00e1nos. - 'It is the apple that is seen by John'. (The pear may not be seen by John, but it may be smelled, for example.)\n*''Az alm\u00e1t''''' J\u00e1nos''' l\u00e1tja. - 'It is by John that the apple is seen'. (It is not seen by Peter, but the pear may be seen by Peter, for example.)\n\n==Politeness==\n{{Main article|T\u2013V distinction#Hungarian}}\n\nHungarian has a four-tiered system for expressing levels of politeness. From highest to lowest:\n\n*''\u00d6n'' (''\u00f6n\u00f6z\u00e9s''): Use of this form in speech shows respect towards the person addressed, but it is also the common way of speaking in official texts and business communications. Here \"you\", the second person, is grammatically addressed in the third person.\n*''Maga'' (''mag\u00e1z\u00e1s'', ''mag\u00e1z\u00f3d\u00e1s''): Use of this form serves to show that the speakers wish to distance themselves from the person they address. A boss could also address a subordinate as ''maga''. Aside from the different [[pronoun]] it is grammatically the same as \"''\u00f6n\u00f6z\u00e9s''\".\n*''N\u00e9ni/b\u00e1csi'' (''tetszikez\u00e9s''): This is a somewhat affectionate way of expressing politeness and is grammatically the same as \"''\u00f6n\u00f6z\u00e9s''\" or \"''mag\u00e1z\u00f3d\u00e1s''\", but adds a certain verb in auxiliary role \"''tetszik''\" (\"like\") to support the main verb of the sentence. For example, children are supposed to address adults who are not parent, close friends or close relatives by using \"''tetszik''\" (\"you like\"): \"''Hogy vagy?''\" (\"How are you?\") here becomes \"''Hogy tetszik lenni?''\" (\"How do you like to be?\"). The elderly, especially women, are generally addressed this way, even by adults.\n*''Te'' (''tegez\u00e9s'', ''tegez\u0151d\u00e9s'' or ''pertu'', [[per tu]] from [[Latin]]): Used generally, i.e. with persons with whom none of the above forms of politeness is required, and, in religious contexts, to address [[God]]. The highest rank, the [[king]], was traditionally addressed \"per tu\" by all, peasants and noblemen alike, though with Hungary not having had any crowned king since 1918, this practice survives only in folk tales and children's stories. Use of \"''tegez\u00e9s''\" in the media and advertisements has become more frequent since the early 1990s. It is informal and is normally used in families, among friends, colleagues, among young people, and adults speaking to children; it can be compared to addressing somebody by their first name in English. Perhaps prompted by the widespread use of English (a language without [[T\u2013V distinction]] [[thou|in most contemporary dialects]]) on the Internet, \"''tegez\u00e9s''\" is also becoming the standard way to address people over the Internet, regardless of politeness.\n\nThe four-tiered system has somewhat been eroded due to the recent expansion of \"''tegez\u0151d\u00e9s''\".\n\nSome anomalies emerged with the arrival of multinational companies who have addressed their customers in the ''te'' (least polite) form right from the beginning of their presence in Hungary. A typical example is the Swedish furniture shop [[IKEA]], whose web site and other publications address the customers in ''te'' form. When a news site<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kanizsaujsag.hu/hirek/8351/miert-tegezik-a-magyarokat-a-multik/|title=Mi\u00e9rt tegezik a magyarokat a multik? - Kanizsa \u00dajs\u00e1g|first=Kanizsa|last=Ujsag|website=Kanizsaujsag.hu|accessdate=8 October 2017}}</ref> asked IKEA\u2014using the ''te'' form\u2014why they address their customers this way, IKEA's PR Manager explained in his answer\u2014using the ''\u00f6n'' form\u2014that their way of communication reflects IKEA's open-mindedness and the Swedish culture. However IKEA in France use the most polite (''vous'') form. Another example is the communication of Telenor (a mobile network operator) towards its customers.

The words in these bushes share a common root, are related through inflection, derivation and compounding, and are usually broadly related in meaning.\n\nThe basic vocabulary shares some hundreds word roots with other [[Uralic languages]] like [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Estonian language|Estonian]], [[Mansi language|Mansi]] and [[Khanty language|Khanty]]. Examples of such include the verb ''\u00e9l'' 'live' (Finnish ''el\u00e4\u00e4''<ref name=Helsinki>{{cite web|title=\"Related words\" in Finnish and Hungarian|url=http://www.helsinki.fi/~jolaakso/f-h-ety.html|publisher=Helsinki University Bulletin|accessdate=2008-06-15}}</ref>), the numbers ''kett\u0151'' 'two', ''h\u00e1rom'' 'three', ''n\u00e9gy'' 'four' (cf.

Agricultural words are about 50% r-Turkic and 50% Slavic; pastoral terms are more r-Turkic, less Ugric and less Slavic. Finally, Christian and state terminology is more Slavic and less r-Turkic. The Slavic is most probably proto-Slovakian and/or -Slovenian. This is easily understood in the Uralic paradigm, proto-Magyars were first similar to Ob-Ugors who were mainly hunters, fishers & gatherers, but with some horses, too. Then they accultured to Bulgarian r-Turks, so the older layer of agriculture words (wine, beer, wheat, barley &c.) are purely r-Turkic, and also lots of termini of statesmanship & religion were, too.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rmki.kfki.hu/~lukacs/DETREHUN.htm|title=PROTO-MAGYAR TEXTS FROM THE MIDDLE OF 1st MILLENIUM<!--sic-->?|website=Rmki.kfki.hu|accessdate=8 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n{{bar box\n| width = 300px\n| title = Origin of word roots in Hungarian<ref name=\"kenesei-p134\">''A nyelv \u00e9s a nyelvek'' (\"Language and languages\"), edited by Istv\u00e1n Kenesei.

There are an increasing number of English loan-words, especially in technical fields.\n\nAnother source<ref name=\"Halukinen-p307\">''The Structure and Development of the Finnish Language'', The Uralic and Altaic Series: 1960\u20131993 V.1-150, By Denis Sinor, John R. Krueger, Lauri Hakulinen, Gustav Bayerle, Translated by John R. Krueger, Compiled by Gustav Bayerle, Contributor Denis Sinor, Published by Routledge, 1997\n{{ISBN|0-7007-0380-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7007-0380-7}}, 383 pages. p. 307</ref> differs in that loanwords in Hungarian are held to constitute about 45% of bases in the language. Although the lexical percentage of native words in Hungarian is 55%, their use accounts for 88.4% of all words used (the percentage of loanwords used being just 11.6%). Therefore, the history of Hungarian has come, especially since the 19th century, to favor neologisms from original bases, whilst still having developed as many terms from neighboring languages in the lexicon.\n\n===Word formation===\nWords can be compounds or derived.  Most derivation is with suffixes, but there is a small set of derivational prefixes as well.\n\n====Compounds====\nCompounds have been present in the language since the [[Proto-Uralic]] era. Numerous ancient compounds transformed to base words during the centuries. Today, compounds play an important role in vocabulary.\n\nA good example is the word ''arc'':\n\n:: ''orr'' (nose) + ''sz\u00e1j'' (mouth) \u2192 ''orca'' (face) (colloquial until the end of the 19th century and still in use in some dialects) > ''arc'' (face)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nemzetismeret.hu/?id=3.2 |title=It's written in chapter Testr\u00e9szek |publisher=Nemzetismeret.hu |date= |accessdate=2010-01-31}}</ref>\n\nCompounds are made up of two base words: the first is the prefix, the latter is the suffix. A compound can be ''subordinative'': <!-- subordinative is \"al\u00e1rendel\u0151\" in Hungarian; it was rather coined by me. I can't find *ANY* reference on this in English. If you can, please translate al\u00e1rendel\u0151 properly. Other \"Hunglish\" words include subjective, objective, determinative, adjunctive and coordinative. --> the prefix is in logical connection with the suffix. If the prefix is the subject of the suffix, the compound is generally classified as a [[subjective case|subjective]] one. There are [[objective case|objective]], [[determiner (linguistics)|determinative]], and [[adjunct (grammar)|adjunct]]ive compounds as well. Some examples are given below:\n\n: Subjective:\n:: ''menny'' (heaven) + ''d\u00f6r\u00f6g'' (rumble) \u2192 ''mennyd\u00f6r\u00f6g'' (thundering)\n:: ''Nap'' (Sun) + ''s\u00fct\u00f6tte'' (lit by) \u2192 ''naps\u00fct\u00f6tte'' (sunlit)\n: Objective:\n:: ''fa'' (tree, wood) + ''v\u00e1g\u00f3'' (cutter) \u2192 ''fav\u00e1g\u00f3'' (lumberjack, literally \"woodcutter\")\n: Determinative:\n:: ''\u00faj'' (new) + ''j\u00e1'' (modification of ''-v\u00e1, -v\u00e9'' a suffix meaning \"making it to something\")  + ''\u00e9p\u00edt\u00e9s'' (construction) \u2192 ''\u00fajj\u00e1\u00e9p\u00edt\u00e9s'' (reconstruction, literally \"making something to be new by construction\")\n: Adjunctive:\n:: ''s\u00e1rga'' (yellow) + ''r\u00e9z'' (copper) \u2192 ''s\u00e1rgar\u00e9z'' (brass)\n\nAccording to current orthographic rules, a subordinative compound word has to be written as a single word, without spaces; however, if the length of a compound of three or more words (not counting one-syllable verbal prefixes) is seven or more [[syllables]] long  (not counting case suffixes), a hyphen must be inserted at the appropriate boundary to ease the determination of word boundaries for the reader.\n\nOther compound words are ''coordinatives'': there is no concrete relation between the prefix and the suffix. Subcategories include word duplications (to emphasise the meaning; ''olykor-olykor''\n'really occasionally'), twin words (where a base word and a distorted form of it makes up a compound: ''gizgaz'', where the suffix 'gaz' means 'weed' and the prefix ''giz'' is the distorted form; the compound itself means 'inconsiderable weed'), and such compounds which have meanings, but neither their prefixes, nor their suffixes make sense (for example, ''hercehurca'' 'complex, obsolete procedures').\n\nA compound also can be made up by multiple (i.e., more than two) base words: in this case, at least one word element, or even both the prefix and the suffix is a compound. Some examples:\n\n: ''elme'' [mind; standalone base] + (''gy\u00f3gy'' [medical] + ''int\u00e9zet'' [institute]) \u2192 ''elmegy\u00f3gyint\u00e9zet'' ([[Psychiatric hospital|asylum]])\n: (''hadi'' [militarian] + ''fogoly'' [prisoner]) + (''munka'' [work] + ''t\u00e1bor'' [camp]) \u2192 ''hadifogoly-munkat\u00e1bor'' (work camp of prisoners of war)\n\n===Noteworthy lexical items===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}\n\n====Points of the compass====\nHungarian words for the points of the compass are directly derived from the position of the [[Sun]] during the [[day]] in the [[Northern hemisphere]].\n\n*North = \u00e9szak (from \"\u00e9j(szaka)\", 'night'), as the Sun never shines from the North\n*South = d\u00e9l ('noon'), as the Sun shines from the South at noon\n*East = kelet ('rise'), as the Sun rises in the East\n*West = nyugat ('set'), as the Sun sets in the West\n\n====Two words for \"red\"====\n<!-- Must this \"red\" issue really be this long? -->\n\nThere are two basic words for \"red\" in Hungarian: \"piros\" and \"v\u00f6r\u00f6s\" (variant: \"veres\"; compare with Estonian \"verev\" or Finnish \"punainen\"). (They are basic in the sense that one is not a sub-type of the other, as the English \"scarlet\" is of \"red\".) The word \"v\u00f6r\u00f6s\" is related to \"v\u00e9r\", meaning \"blood\" (Finnish and Estonian \"veri\"). When they refer to an actual difference in colour (as on a colour chart), \"v\u00f6r\u00f6s\" usually refers to the deeper (darker and/or more red and less orange) hue of red. In English similar differences exist between \"scarlet\"  and \"red\". While many languages have multiple [[colour name|names for this colour]], often Hungarian scholars assume this is unique in recognizing two shades of red as separate and distinct \"[[folk colour]]s\".<ref name=\"basiccolor\">Berlin, B and Kay, P (1969). \"Basic Color Terms.\" Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press</ref>\n\nHowever, the two words are also used independently of the above in [[collocation]]s. \"Piros\" is learned by children first, as it is generally used to describe inanimate, artificial things, or things seen as cheerful or neutral, while \"v\u00f6r\u00f6s\" typically refers to animate or natural things (biological, geological, physical and astronomical objects), as well as serious or emotionally charged subjects.\n\nWhen the rules outlined above are in contradiction, typical collocations usually prevail. In some cases where a typical collocation does not exist, the use of either of the two words may be equally adequate.\n\nExamples:\n*Expressions where \"red\" typically translates to \"piros\": a red road sign, red traffic lights, the red line of [[Budapest Metro]], red (now called express) bus lines in Budapest, a holiday shown in red in the calendar, ruddy complexion, the red nose of a clown, some red flowers (those of a neutral nature, e.g. tulips), red peppers and paprika, red card suits (hearts and diamonds), red stripes on a flag (but the [[red flag (politics)|red flag]] and its variants translate to \"v\u00f6r\u00f6s\"), etc.\n*Expressions where \"red\" typically translates to \"v\u00f6r\u00f6s\": [[Red Sea]], [[Red Square]], [[Red Army]], [[Red Baron]], [[Erik the Red]], [[red wine]], red carpet (for receiving important guests), red hair or beard, red lion (the mythical animal), the [[Red Cross]], the novel ''[[The Red and the Black]]'', [[redshift]], [[red giant]], [[red blood cell]]s, [[red oak]], some red flowers (those with passionate connotations, e.g. roses), red fox, names of ferric and other red minerals, red copper, rust, red phosphorus, the colour of blushing with anger or shame, the red nose of an alcoholic (in contrast with that of a clown, see above), the red posterior of a baboon, red meat, regular onion (not the red onion, which is \"lila\"), [[litmus test|litmus]] paper (in acid), cities, countries, or other political entities associated with [[leftist]] movements (e.g. [[Red Vienna]], [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Red Russia]]), etc.\n\n====Kinship terms====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}\nThe Hungarian words for brothers and sisters are differentiated based upon relative age. There is also a general word for \"sibling\": ''testv\u00e9r'', from ''test'' \"body\" and ''v\u00e9r'' \"blood\"; ''i.e.'', originating from the same body and blood.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| ||younger||elder||unspecified<br>relative age\n|-\n|brother||''\u00f6cs<!--yes, it's written as \"\u00f6cs\", not \"\u00f6ccs\"-->''||''b\u00e1ty<!-- it is written as \"b\u00e1ty\", not \"b\u00e1tya\" -->''||''fiv\u00e9r'' or<br>''fi\u00fatestv\u00e9r''\n|-\n|sister||''h\u00fag''||''n\u0151v\u00e9r''||''n\u0151v\u00e9r'' or<br>''l\u00e1nytestv\u00e9r''\n|-\n|sibling|| <small>''kistestv\u00e9r''</small> || <small>''(nagytestv\u00e9r)''</small> ||''testv\u00e9r''\n|}\n\n(There used to be a separate word for \"elder sister\", ''n\u00e9ne'',<!-- NEM N\u00c9NI, HANEM N\u00c9NE, E-VEL--> but it has become obsolete [except to mean \"aunt\" in some dialects] and has been replaced by the generic word for \"sister\".)\n\nIn addition, there are separate prefixes for several ancestors and descendants:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|parent||grandparent||great-<br>grandparent||great-great-<br>grandparent||great-great-great-<br>grandparent\n|great-great-great-great-\ngrandparent\n|-\n||''sz\u00fcl\u0151''||''nagysz\u00fcl\u0151''||''d\u00e9d(nagy)sz\u00fcl\u0151''||''\u00fck(nagy)sz\u00fcl\u0151''||''sz\u00e9p(nagy)sz\u00fcl\u0151''<br>(OR ''\u00fck-\u00fck(nagy)sz\u00fcl\u0151'')\n|''\u00f3(nagy)sz\u00fcl\u0151''\n(OR ''\u00fck-\u00fck-\u00fck(nagy)sz\u00fcl\u0151)''\n|-\n|child||grandchild||great-<br>grandchild||great-great-<br>grandchild||great-great-great-<br>grandchild\n|great-great-great-great-<br>grandchild\n|-\n|''gyerek''||''unoka''||''d\u00e9dunoka''||''\u00fckunoka''||''sz\u00e9punoka''<br>(OR ''\u00fck-\u00fckunoka'')\n|''\u00f3unoka''<br>(OR ''\u00fck-\u00fck-\u00fckunoka'')\n|}\n\nThe words for \"boy\" and \"girl\" are applied with possessive suffixes.

However, the word ''fi\u00fa'' can also take the regular suffix, in which case the resulting word ''(fi\u00faja)'' will refer to a lover or partner (boyfriend), rather than a male offspring.\n\nThe word ''fi\u00fa'' (boy) is also often noted as an extreme example of the ability of the language to add suffixes to a word, by forming ''fiai\u00e9i'', adding vowel-form suffixes only, where the result is quite a frequently used word:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| fi\u00fa || boy\n|-\n| fia || his/her son\n|-\n| fiai || his/her sons\n|-\n| fi\u00e1\u00e9 || his/her son's (singular object)\n|-\n| fi\u00e1\u00e9i || his/her son's (plural object)\n|-\n| fiai\u00e9 || his/her sons' (singular object)\n|-\n| fiai\u00e9i || his/her sons' (plural object)\n|}\n\n====Extremely long words====\n*''megszents\u00e9gtelen\u00edthetetlens\u00e9gesked\u00e9seitek\u00e9rt''\n: Partition to root and suffixes with explanations:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| meg- || verb prefix; in this case, it means \"completed\"\n|-\n| szent || holy (the word root)\n|-\n| -s\u00e9g || like English \"-ness\", as in \"holiness\"\n|-\n| -t(e)len || variant of \"-tlen\", noun suffix expressing the lack of something; like English \"-less\", as in \"useless\"\n|-\n| -\u00edt || constitutes a transitive verb from an adjective\n|-\n| -het || expresses possibility; somewhat similar to the English modal verbs \"may\" or \"can\"\n|-\n| -(e)tlen || another variant of \"-tlen\"\n|-\n| -s\u00e9g || (see above)\n|-\n| -es || constitutes an adjective from a noun; like English \"-y\" as in \"witty\"\n|-\n| -ked || attached to an adjective (e.g. \"strong\"), produces the verb \"to pretend to be (strong)\" <!-- cf. \"okoskodik\", \"er\u0151sk\u00f6dik\"; the \"-ik\" is dropped due to the further suffixes, thus it is better not to mark it in the table -->\n|-\n| -\u00e9s || constitutes a noun from a verb; there are various ways this is done in English, e.g. \"-ance\" in \"acceptance\"\n|-\n| -eitek || plural possessive suffix, second-person plural (e.g. \"apple\" \u2192 \"your apples\", where \"your\" refers to multiple people)\n|-\n| -\u00e9rt || approximately translates to \"because of\", or in this case simply \"for\"\n|}\n\n: '''Translation:''' \"for your [plural] repeated pretending to be indesecrable\"<!-- the element \"repeated\" comes from -s\u00e9gesked\u00e9s-, which can refer to a constant and annoying habit-->\n\nThe above word is often considered to be the longest word in Hungarian, although there are longer words like:\n\n* ''legeslegmegszents\u00e9gtelen\u00edttethetetlenebbjeitekk\u00e9nt''\n:''leges-leg-meg-'''''szent'''''-s\u00e9g-telen-\u00edt-tet-het-etlen-ebb-je-i-tek-k\u00e9nt''\n:\"like those of you that are the very least possible to get desecrated\"\n\nWords of such length are not used in practice, but when spoken they are easily understood by natives. They were invented to show, in a somewhat facetious way, the ability of the language to form long words (see [[agglutinative language]]). They are not compound words\u2014they are formed by adding a series of one and two-syllable suffixes (and a few prefixes) to a simple root (\"szent\", saint or holy).\nThere is virtually no limit for the length of words, but when too many suffixes are added, the meaning of the word becomes less clear, and the word becomes hard to understand, and will work like a riddle even for native speakers.\n\n====Hungarian words in English====\nThe English word best known as being of Hungarian origin is probably ''[[paprika]]'', from Serbo-Croatian ''papar'' \"pepper\" and the Hungarian diminutive ''-ka''.  The most common however is ''[[Coach (carriage)|coach]]'', from ''kocsi'', originally ''kocsi szek\u00e9r'' \"car from/in the style of [[Kocs]]\".  Others are:\n\n* [[shako]], from ''cs\u00e1k\u00f3'', from ''cs\u00e1k\u00f3s\u00fcveg'' \"peaked cap\"\n* [[sabre]], from ''szablya''\n* [[wikt:heyduck|heyduck]], from ''hajd\u00fak'', plural of ''hajd\u00fa'' \"brigand\"\n* [[tolpatch]], from ''talpas'' \"foot-soldier\", apparently derived from ''talp'' \"[[sole (foot)|sole]]\".\n\n==Writing system==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}\n{{Main article|Hungarian alphabet|Hungarian orthography|Hungarian braille}}\n[[File:Tihany 1055.PNG|thumb|The oldest surviving words written in Hungarian, from the founding declaration of the [[Tihany|Benedictine Abbey of Tihany]], 1055. <br> It reads \"''feheruuaru rea meneh hodu utu rea''\" (in modern Hungarian \"''Feh\u00e9rv\u00e1rra men\u0151 hadi \u00fatra''\", meaning \"''to the military road going to [[Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r|Feh\u00e9rv\u00e1r]]''\")]]\n[[File:A 4-es t\u00e1bl\u00e1ja.jpg|thumb|Hungarian language road sign]]\n\n[[File:Codex of munchen - bible in hungarian.jpg|thumb|Medieval Hungarian book (a copy of the [[Hussite Bible]]), 1466]]\n\nThe Hungarian language was originally written in right-to-left [[Old Hungarian alphabet|Old Hungarian runes]], superficially similar in appearance to the better-known [[futhark]] runes but unrelated. When [[Stephen I of Hungary]] established the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] in the year 1000, the old system was gradually discarded in favour of the Latin alphabet and left-to-right order. Although now not used at all in everyday life, the old script is still known and practiced by some enthusiasts.\n\nModern Hungarian is written using an expanded [[Latin script|Latin alphabet]], and has a [[phoneme|phonemic]] orthography, i.e. pronunciation can generally be predicted from the written language. In addition to the standard letters of the Latin alphabet, Hungarian uses several modified Latin characters to represent the additional vowel sounds of the language. These include letters with acute accents ''(\u00e1, \u00e9, \u00ed, \u00f3, \u00fa)'' to represent long vowels, and umlauts (''\u00f6'' and ''\u00fc'') and their long counterparts [[Double acute accent|''\u0151'' and ''\u0171'']] to represent front vowels. Sometimes (usually as a result of a technical glitch on a computer) {{angle bracket|\u00f4}} or {{angle bracket|\u00f5}} is used for {{angle bracket|\u0151}}, and {{angle bracket|\u00fb}} for {{angle bracket|\u0171}}. This is often due to the limitations of the [[ISO/IEC 8859-1|Latin-1 / ISO-8859-1 code page]]. These letters are not part of the Hungarian language, and are considered misprints. Hungarian can be properly represented with the [[ISO/IEC 8859-2|Latin-2 / ISO-8859-2 code page]], but this [[code page]] is not always available. (Hungarian is the only language using both {{angle bracket|\u0151}} and {{angle bracket|\u0171}}.) [[Unicode]] includes them, and so they can be used on the Internet.\n\nAdditionally, the letter pairs [[Hungarian ny|{{angle bracket|ny}}]], [[Hungarian ty|{{angle bracket|ty}}]], and [[Hungarian gy|{{angle bracket|gy}}]] represent the palatal consonants {{IPA|/\u0272/}}, {{IPA|/c/}}, and {{IPA|/\u025f/}} (a little like the \"d+y\" sounds in British \"''du''ke\" or American \"woul''d y''ou\")&nbsp;\u2013 a bit like saying \"d\" with the tongue pointing to the [[palate]].\n\nHungarian uses {{angle bracket|s}} for {{IPA|/\u0283/}} and [[Hungarian sz|{{angle bracket|sz}}]] for {{IPA|/s/}}, which is the reverse of [[Polish language|Polish]] usage. The letter [[Hungarian zs|{{angle bracket|zs}}]] is {{IPA|/\u0292/}} and [[Hungarian cs|{{angle bracket|cs}}]] is {{IPA|/t\u0361\u0283/}}. These digraphs are considered single letters in the alphabet. The letter [[Hungarian ly|{{angle bracket|ly}}]] is also a \"single letter digraph\", but is pronounced like {{IPA|/j/}} (English {{angle bracket|y}}), and appears mostly in old words. The letters [[Hungarian dz|{{angle bracket|dz}}]] and [[Hungarian dzs|{{angle bracket|dzs}}]] {{IPA|/d\u0361\u0292/}} are exotic remnants and are hard to find even in longer texts. Some examples still in common use are ''madzag'' (\"string\"), ''edzeni'' (\"to train (athletically)\") and ''dzsungel'' (\"jungle\").\n\nSometimes additional information is required for partitioning words with digraphs: h\u00e1zsz\u00e1m (\"street number\") = ''h\u00e1z'' (\"house\") + ''sz\u00e1m'' (\"number\"), not an unintelligible ''h\u00e1zs'' + ''z\u00e1m''.\n\nHungarian distinguishes between long and short vowels, with long vowels written with acutes. It also distinguishes between long and short consonants, with long consonants being doubled. For example, ''lenni'' (\"to be\"), ''hozz\u00e1sz\u00f3l\u00e1s'' (\"comment\"). The digraphs, when doubled, become trigraphs: {{angle bracket|sz}} + {{angle bracket|sz}} = {{angbr|ssz}}, e.g. ''m\u0171v\u00e9sszel'' (\"with an artist\"). But when the digraph occurs at the end of a line, all of the letters are written out. For example, (\"with a bus\"):\n:... ''busz-''\n:''szal''...\n\nWhen the first lexeme of a compound ends in a digraph and the second lexeme starts with the same digraph, both digraphs are written out: ''jegy'' + ''gy\u0171r\u0171'' = ''jegygy\u0171r\u0171'' (\"engagement/wedding ring\", ''jegy'' means \"sign\", \"mark\". The term ''jegyben lenni/j\u00e1rni'' means \"to be engaged\"; ''gy\u0171r\u0171'' means \"ring\").\n\nUsually a trigraph is a double digraph, but there are a few exceptions: ''tizennyolc'' (\"eighteen\") is a concatenation of ''tizen'' + ''nyolc''. There are doubling [[minimal pair]]s: ''tol'' (\"push\") vs. ''toll'' (\"feather\" or \"pen\").\n\nWhile to English speakers they may seem unusual at first, once the new orthography and pronunciation are learned, written Hungarian is almost completely phonemic (except for etymological spellings and \"ly, j\" representing {{IPA|/j/}}).\n\n==Word order==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}\nThe [[word order]] is basically from general to specific. This is a typical analytical approach and is used generally in Hungarian.\n\n===Name order===\n{{Main article|Hungarian names}}\nThe Hungarian language uses the so-called eastern [[Personal name#Name order|name order]], in which the surname (general, deriving from the family) comes first and the [[given name]] comes last. If a second given name is used, this follows the first given name.\n\n====Hungarian names in foreign languages====\nFor clarity, in foreign languages Hungarian names are usually represented in the western name order. Sometimes, however, especially in the neighbouring countries of Hungary&nbsp;\u2013 where there is a [[Treaty of Trianon|significant Hungarian population]]&nbsp;\u2013 the Hungarian name order is retained, as it causes less confusion there.\n\nFor an example of foreign use, the birth name of the Hungarian-born physicist, the \"father of the [[hydrogen bomb]]\" was '''''Teller Ede''''', but he immigrated to the United States in the 1930s and thus became known as '''''[[Edward Teller]]'''''. Prior to the mid-20th century, given names were usually translated along with the name order; this is no longer as common. For example, the pianist uses ''[[Andr\u00e1s Schiff]]'' when abroad, not ''Andrew Schiff'' (in Hungarian ''Schiff Andr\u00e1s''). If a second given name is present, it becomes a middle name and is usually written out in full, rather than truncated to an initial.\n\n====Foreign names in Hungarian====\nIn modern usage, foreign names retain their order when used in Hungarian. Therefore:\n\n*Amikor ''Kiss J\u00e1nos'' Los Angelesben volt, l\u00e1tta ''John Travolt\u00e1-t.'' (means: When Kiss J\u00e1nos was in [[Los Angeles]] he saw John Travolta.)\n:The Hungarian name ''Kiss J\u00e1nos'' is in the Hungarian name order (''J\u00e1nos'' is equivalent to ''John''), but the foreign name ''John Travolta'' remains in the western name order.\n\nBefore the 20th century, not only was it common to reverse the order of foreign personalities, they were also \"Hungarianised\": ''Goethe J\u00e1nos Farkas'' (originally [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe]]). This usage sounds odd today, when only a few well-known personalities are referred to using their Hungarianised names, including ''Verne Gyula'' ([[Jules Verne]]), ''Marx K\u00e1roly'' ([[Karl Marx]]), ''Kolumbusz Krist\u00f3f'' ([[Christopher Columbus]], note that it is also translated in English).\n\nSome native speakers disapprove of this usage; the names of certain historical religious personalities (including popes), however, are always Hungarianised by practically all speakers, such as ''Luther M\u00e1rton'' ([[Martin Luther]]), ''Husz J\u00e1nos'' ([[Jan Hus]]), ''K\u00e1lvin J\u00e1nos'' ([[John Calvin]]); just like the names of [[monarch]]s, for example the king of Spain, [[Juan Carlos I]] is referred to as ''I. J\u00e1nos K\u00e1roly'' or the queen of the UK, [[Elizabeth II]] is referred to as ''II. Erzs\u00e9bet''.\n\n[[Japanese names]], which are usually written in western order in the rest of Europe, retain their original order in Hungarian, e. g. ''Kuroszava Akira'' instead of [[Akira Kurosawa]].\n\n====Date and time====\nThe Hungarian convention for date and time is to go from the generic to the specific: 1. year, 2. month, 3. day, 4. hour, 5. minute, (6. second)\n\nThe year and day are always written in [[Arabic numerals]], followed by a [[full stop]]. The month can be written by its full name or can be abbreviated, or even denoted by [[Roman numerals|Roman]] or Arabic numerals. Except for the first case (month written by its full name), the month is followed by a full stop. Usually, when the month is written in letters, there is no leading zero before the day. On the other hand, when the month is written in Arabic numerals, a leading zero is common, but not obligatory. Except at the beginning of a sentence, the name of the month always begins with a lower-case letter.\n\nHours, minutes, and seconds are separated by a colon (H:m:s). Fractions of a second are separated by a full stop from the rest of the time. Hungary generally uses the [[24-hour clock]] format, but in verbal (and written) communication [[12-hour clock]] format can also be used. See below for usage examples.\n\nDate and time may be separated by a comma or simply written one after the other.\n\n*2008. febru\u00e1r 9. 16:23:42 ''or'' 2008. febru\u00e1r 9., 16:23:42\n*2008. febr. 9.\n*2008. 02. 09. ''or'' 2008. 2. 9. (rarely)\n*2008. II. 9.\n\nDate separated by [[hyphen]] is also spreading, especially on datestamps. Here&nbsp;\u2013 just like the version separated by full stops&nbsp;\u2013 leading zeros are in use.\n\n*2008-02-09\n\nWhen only hours and minutes are written in a sentence (so not only \"displaying\" time), these parts can be separated by a [[full stop]] (e.g. \"Tal\u00e1lkozzunk 10.35-kor.\"&nbsp;\u2013 \"Let's meet at 10.35.\"), or it is also regular to write hours in normal size, and minutes put in [[superscript]] (and not necessarily) underlined (e.g. \"A tal\u00e1lkoz\u00f3 10<sup>35</sup>-kor kezd\u0151dik.\" ''or'' \"A tal\u00e1lkoz\u00f3 10<sup><u>35</u></sup>-kor kezd\u0151dik.\"&nbsp;\u2013 \"The meeting begins at 10.35.\").\n\nAlso, in verbal and written communication it is common to use \"d\u00e9lel\u0151tt\" (literally \"before noon\") and \"d\u00e9lut\u00e1n\" (lit. \"after noon\") abbreviated as \"de.\" and \"du.\" respectively. D\u00e9lel\u0151tt and d\u00e9lut\u00e1n is said or written before the time, e.g. \"D\u00e9lut\u00e1n 4 \u00f3ra van.\"&nbsp;\u2013 \"It's 4 p.m.\". However e.g. \"d\u00e9lel\u0151tt 5 \u00f3ra\" (should mean \"5 a.m.\") or \"d\u00e9lut\u00e1n 10 \u00f3ra\" (should mean \"10 p.m.\") are never used, because at these times the sun is not up, instead \"hajnal\" (\"dawn\"), \"reggel\" (\"morning\"), \"este\" (\"evening\") and \"\u00e9jjel\" (\"night\") is used, however there are no exact rules for the use of these, as everybody uses them according to their habits (e.g. somebody may have woken up at 5 a.m. so he/she says \"Reggel 6-kor ettem.\"&nbsp;\u2013 \"I had food at ''*morning'' 6.\", and somebody woke up at 11 a.m. so he/she says \"Hajnali 6-kor m\u00e9g aludtam.\"&nbsp;\u2013 \"I was still sleeping at ''*dawn'' 6.\"). Roughly, these expressions mean these times:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Expression!!Approximate time\n|-\n|Hajnal||4\u20136 a.m.\n|-\n|Reggel||6\u20139 a.m.\n|-\n|D\u00e9lel\u0151tt (de.)||9 a.m.&nbsp;\u2013 12 p.m.\n|-\n|D\u00e9l*||=12 p.m. (=\"noon\")\n|-\n|D\u00e9lut\u00e1n (du.)||12\u20136 p.m.\n|-\n|Este||6\u201311 p.m.\n|-\n|\u00c9jjel||11 p.m.&nbsp;\u2013 4 a.m.\n|-\n|\u00c9jf\u00e9l*||=12 a.m. (=\"midnight\")\n|}\n* * \"D\u00e9l\" and \"\u00e9jf\u00e9l\" mean these exact times, so using time after them is incorrect. So there is '''no''' \"\u00c9jf\u00e9l 0-kor m\u00e9g buliztunk\" (\"We were still partying at ''*midnight 0''.\") or \"D\u00e9l 12-kor s\u00fct a nap.\" (\"The sun shines at ''*noon 12''.\"). Instead \"\u00c9jf\u00e9l'''kor''' m\u00e9g buliztunk.\" and \"D\u00e9l'''ben''' s\u00fct a nap.\" is correct. (More confusingly, one can say \"D\u00e9l'''i''' 12-kor s\u00fct a nap.\", meaning \"The sun shines at 12 '''of''' noon.\", i.e. \"The sun shines at 12, which is the 12 of daytime.\") \"D\u00e9len s\u00fct a nap\" on the other hand means \"The sun shines in the south\", as D\u00e9l means both noon and south.\n\n==== Addresses ====\n\nAlthough address formatting is increasingly being influenced by standard European conventions, the traditional Hungarian style is:\n\n'''Budapest, De\u00e1k Ferenc t\u00e9r 1. 1052'''\n\nSo the order is: 1) settlement (most general), 2) street/square/etc. (more specific), 3) house number (most specific) 4)(HU-)postcode. The house number may be followed by the storey and door numbers. The HU- part before the postcode is only for incoming postal traffic from foreign countries. Addresses on envelopes and postal parcels should be formatted and placed on the right side as follows:\n\nName of the recipient<br />\nSettlement<br />\nStreet address (up to door number if necessary)<br />\n(HU-)postcode\n\n==Vocabulary examples==\n''Note: The stress is always placed on the first syllable of each word.  The remaining syllables all receive an equal, lesser stress.  All syllables are pronounced clearly and evenly, even at the end of a sentence, unlike in English.''\n\n=== Numbers ===\n<small>Source: Wiktionary<ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:Hungarian_cardinal_numbers|title=Category:Hungarian cardinal numbers - Wiktionary|website=en.wiktionary.org|accessdate=8 October 2017}}</ref></small>\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The Ancient Greek [[wikt:\u1f51\u03bc\u03ae\u03bd|\u1f51\u03bc\u03ae\u03bd]] (''hymen'') for membrane provides a plausible [[etymology]] for the term because species in this order have membranous wings.

Their [[insect mouthparts|mouthparts]] are adapted for chewing, with well-developed [[Mandible (insect mouthpart)|mandible]]s (ectognathous mouthparts).  Many species have further developed the mouthparts into a lengthy [[proboscis]], with which they can drink liquids, such as [[nectar]]. They have large [[compound eyes]], and typically three simple eyes, [[ocelli]].\n\nThe forward margin of the hind wing bears a number of hooked bristles, or \"[[hamuli]]\", which lock onto the fore wing, keeping them held together. The smaller species may have only two or three hamuli on each side, but the largest wasps may have a considerable number, keeping the wings gripped together especially tightly. Hymenopteran wings have relatively few veins compared with many other insects, especially in the smaller species.\n\nIn the more ancestral hymenopterans, the [[ovipositor]] is blade-like, and has evolved for slicing plant tissues. In the majority, however, it is modified for piercing, and, in some cases, is several times the length of the body. In some species, the ovipositor has become modified as a [[stinger]], and the [[egg (biology)|eggs]] are laid from the base of the structure, rather than from the tip, which is used only to inject [[venom]]. The sting is typically used to immobilise prey, but in some wasps and bees may be used in defense.<ref name=IIBD/>\n\nHymenopteran larvae typically have a distinct head region, three thoracic segments, and usually nine or 10 abdominal segments. In the suborder [[Symphyta]], the larvae resemble [[caterpillar]]s in appearance, and like them, typically feed on leaves. They have large chewing mandibles, three pairs of thoracic limbs, and, in most cases, six or eight abdominal [[proleg]]s. Unlike caterpillars, however, the prolegs have no grasping spines, and the antennae are reduced to mere stubs. Symphytan larvae that are wood borers or stem borers have no abdominal legs and the thoracic legs are smaller than those of non-borers.\n\nWith rare exceptions larvae of the suborder [[Apocrita]] have no legs and are [[maggot]]like in form, and are adapted to life in a protected environment. This may be the body of a host organism, or a cell in a nest, where the adults will care for the larva. In parasitic forms, the head is often greatly reduced and partially withdrawn into the prothorax (anterior part of the thorax). Sense organs appear to be poorly developed, with no ocelli, very small or absent antennae, and toothlike, sicklelike, or spinelike mandibles. They are also unable to defecate until they reach adulthood due to having an incomplete digestive tract (a blind sac), presumably to avoid contaminating their environment.<ref name=IIBD/> The larvae of stinging forms ([[Aculeata]]) generally have 10 pairs of spiracles, or breathing pores, whereas parasitic forms usually have nine pairs present.<ref name=\"Missouri2007\">{{cite book |last=Hunt |first=James H. |title=The Evolution of Social Wasps |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bFMoSxCVSVIC&pg=PA12 |date=2007 |publisher=Oxford University Press, USA |isbn=978-0-19-804207-5|page=12}}</ref>\n\n==Reproduction==\n\n===Sex determination===\n{{main article|Haplodiploid sex-determination system}}\n\nAmong most or all hymenopterans, sex is [[sex-determination system|determined]] by the number of [[chromosome]]s an individual possesses.<ref name=Cowan2004>{{cite journal |author1=David P.

This is especially likely to occur in an individual whose parents were [[siblings]] or other close relatives. Diploid males are known to be produced by inbreeding in many ant, bee, and wasp species.

Because of this, cooperation among kindred females may be unusually advantageous, and has been hypothesized to contribute to the multiple origins of [[eusociality]] within this order.<ref name=IIBD/> In many colonies of bees, ants, and wasps, worker females will remove eggs laid by other workers due to increased relatedness to direct siblings, a phenomenon known as [[worker policing]].<ref>Davies, N.R., Krebs, J.R., and West, S.A.

In a public service career that spanned over 50 years, he is most notable for having served as the 15th [[Vice President of the United States]]. The first [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] to hold the office, Hamlin served from 1861 to 1865. He is considered among the most influential politicians to have come from Maine.\n\nA native of [[Paris, Maine]], (then part of Massachusetts) Hamlin managed his father's farm before becoming a newspaper editor. He studied law, was admitted to the bar in 1833, and began to practice in [[Hampden, Maine]]. Originally a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], Hamlin began his political career with election to the Maine House of Representatives in 1835 and an appointment to the military staff of the [[Governor of Maine]].  As an officer in the militia, he took part in the 1839 negotiations that helped end the [[Aroostook War]].  In the 1840s Hamlin was elected and served in the [[United States House of Representatives]]. In 1848 the state house elected him to the [[United States Senate]], where he served until January 1857. He served temporarily as governor for six weeks in the beginning of 1857, after which he returned to the Senate. Hamlin was an active opponent of slavery; he supported the [[Wilmot Proviso]] and opposed the [[Compromise Measures of 1850]]. In 1854, he strongly opposed passage of the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]]. Hamlin's increasingly anti-slavery views caused him to leave the Democratic Party for the newly formed Republican Party in 1856.\n\nIn 1860, Hamlin was the Republican nominee for Vice President; selected to run with Abraham Lincoln, who was from Illinois, Hamlin was chosen in part to bring geographic balance to the ticket and in part because as a former Democrat, he could work to convince other anti-slavery Democrats that their future lay with the Republican Party.  The Lincoln and Hamlin ticket was successful, and Hamlin served as Vice President from 1861 to 1865, which included the majority of the [[American Civil War]]. The first Republican Vice President, Hamlin held the office in an era when the office was considered more a part of the legislative branch than the executive; he was not personally close to Lincoln and did not play a major role in his administration.  Even so, Hamlin supported the administration's legislative program in his role as presiding officer of the Senate, and he looked for other ways to demonstrate his support for the Union, including a term of service in a [[Maine State Guard|Maine militia unit]] during the war.\n\nFor the 1864 election, Hamlin was replaced as Vice Presidential nominee by [[Andrew Johnson]], a [[Southern Democrat]] chosen for his appeal to [[Southern Unionists]]. After leaving the vice presidency, Hamlin served as [[Boston Custom House|Collector]] of the [[Port of Boston]], a lucrative post to which he was appointed by Johnson after the latter succeeded to the presidency following Lincoln's assassination. However, Hamlin later resigned as Collector because of his disagreement with Johnson over [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] of the former Confederacy.\n\nIn 1869, Hamlin was elected again to the U.S. Senate, and he served two terms.  After leaving the Senate in 1881, he served briefly as [[United States Ambassador to Spain]] before returning to Maine in late 1882.  In retirement, Hamlin was a resident of [[Bangor, Maine]], where he died in 1891.  He was buried at [[Mount Hope Cemetery, Bangor|Mount Hope Cemetery]] in Bangor.\n\n==Early life==\n\n[[File:Younger Hannibal Hamlin.jpg|thumb|left|Hamlin in early middle age (30s or 40s)]]\nHamlin was born to Cyrus Hamlin and his wife Anna, n\u00e9e Livermore, in [[Paris, Maine|Paris]] (in modern-day [[Maine]], then a part of [[Massachusetts]]). He was a descendant in the sixth generation of English colonist James Hamlin, who had settled in the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] in 1639. He was a grandnephew of U.S. Senator [[Samuel Livermore]] II<ref name=\"lifeandtimes\">{{cite book |last=Hamlin |first=Charles Eugene|date=1899|title=The Life and Times of Hannibal Hamlin by his Grandson Charles Eugene Hamlin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uBFCAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA12|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|publisher=Riverside Press|page=2,12}}</ref> of New Hampshire.\n\nHamlin attended the district schools and [[Hebron Academy]] and later managed his father's farm. From 1827 to 1830 he published the ''Oxford Jeffersonian'' newspaper in partnership with [[Horatio King]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Waterman|first=Charles E.|date=August 1, 1891|title=The Birthplace of Hannibal Hamlin|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BrUVAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA731|journal=[[The New England Magazine]]|volume=4|issue=6|location=Boston, MA|page=731}}</ref>\n\nHe studied law with the firm headed by [[Samuel Fessenden]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Hamlin|first=Charles Eugene|date=1899|title=The Life and Times of Hannibal Hamlin |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uBFCAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA41|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|publisher=Riverside Press|page=41}}</ref> was admitted to the bar in 1833, and began practicing in [[Hampden, Maine]], where he lived until 1848.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=H000121|title=HAMLIN, Hannibal - Biographical Information|accessdate=2018-08-06|publisher=US Congress}}\n</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nHamlin married Sarah Jane Emery of Paris Hill in 1833.

The next year, Hamlin married her half-sister, [[Ellen Vesta Emery]] in 1856. They had two children together: Hannibal E. and Frank.

Appointed a [[Major (United States)|Major]] on the staff of Governor [[John Fairfield]], he served with the militia in the bloodless [[Aroostook War]] of 1839. He facilitated negotiations between Fairfield and Lieutenant Governor [[John Harvey (British Army officer)|John Harvey]] of [[New Brunswick]], which helped reduce tensions and make possible the [[Webster\u2013Ashburton Treaty]], which ended the war.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nHamlin unsuccessfully ran for the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 1840 and left the State House in 1841. He later was elected to two terms in the [[United States House of Representatives]], serving from 1843 to 1847. He was elected by the state legislature to fill a [[U.S. Senate]] vacancy in 1848, and to a full term in 1851. A [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] at the beginning of his career, Hamlin supported the candidacy of [[Franklin Pierce]] in 1852.\n\nFrom the very beginning of his service in Congress, Hamlin was prominent as an opponent of the extension of slavery. He was a conspicuous supporter of the [[Wilmot Proviso]] and spoke against the [[Compromise Measures of 1850]].  In 1854, Hamlin strongly opposed the passage of the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]], which repealed the [[Missouri Compromise]]. After the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] endorsed that repeal at the [[1856 Democratic National Convention]], on June 12, 1856, he withdrew from the Democratic Party and joined the newly organized [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]], causing a national sensation.\n\nThe Republicans nominated Hamlin for [[Governor of Maine]] in the same year. He carried the election by a large majority and was inaugurated on January 8, 1857. In the latter part of February 1857, however, he resigned the governorship. He returned to the [[United States Senate]], serving from 1857 to January 1861.\n\n==Vice presidency==\n\n[[File:Hamlin button 1860.jpg|left|thumb|1860 election campaign button for [[Abraham Lincoln]] and Hannibal Hamlin.  The other side of the button has Lincoln's portrait.]]\nHamlin was nominated by the Republican Party to serve as [[Vice President of the United States]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1860|1860 presidential election]] on a ticket with former Representative [[Abraham Lincoln]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://millercenter.org/president/biography/lincoln-campaigns-and-elections |title=Abraham Lincoln: Campaigns and Elections (Winning Republican Support) |publisher= The Miller Center |access-date=August 27, 2016}}</ref> Given that Lincoln was from Illinois, a vice presidential nominee from [[Maine]] made sense in terms of regional balance. As a former Democrat, Hamlin could also be expected to try to persuade other anti-slavery Democrats that joining the Republican Party was the only way to ensure slavery's demise.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nHamlin and Lincoln were not close personally, but had a good working relationship.  At the time, the Vice President was considered part of the legislative branch in his role as President of the Senate, and so did not attend cabinet meetings; thus, Hamlin did not regularly visit the White House.

He opted to serve, arguing that he could set an example by doing the duty expected of any citizen, and the only concession made because of his office was that he was quartered with the officers. He reported to [[Fort McClary]] in July, initially taking part in routine assignments including guard duty, and later taking over as the company cook.

Although Lincoln was renominated, War Democrat [[Andrew Johnson]] of Tennessee was named to replace Hamlin as Lincoln's running mate. Lincoln was seeking to broaden his base of support and was also looking ahead to Southern [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], at which Johnson had proven himself adept as military governor of occupied Tennessee. Hamlin, by contrast, was an ally of the Northern \"[[Radical Republicans]]\" (who would later [[Impeachment of Andrew Johnson|impeach Johnson]]). Lincoln and Johnson were elected in November 1864, and Hamlin's term expired on March 4, 1865.\n\nAfter leaving the vice presidency Hamlin served briefly as [[Boston Custom House|Collector]] of the [[Port of Boston]].  Appointed to the post by Johnson, Hamlin resigned in protest over Johnson's [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] policy and accompanying efforts to build a political following loyal to him after he had been repudiated by the Republicans.  Republicans had supported Johnson as part of the National Union ticket during the war, but opposed him after he became President and his position on Reconstruction deviated from theirs.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hamlin |first=Charles Eugene |date=1899 |title=The Life and Times of Hannibal Hamlin |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uBFCAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA507 |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |publisher=Riverside Press |pages=505\u2013509}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Hamlin narrowly missed becoming President, his vice presidency would usher in a half-century of sustained national influence for the [[Maine Republican Party]]. In the period 1861\u20131911, Maine Republicans occupied the offices of Vice President, [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] (twice), [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate]], [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives]] (twice), and would field a presidential nominee in [[James G. Blaine]], a level of influence in national politics unmatched by subsequent Maine political delegations.\n\n==Later life==\nNot content with private life, Hamlin returned to the U.S. Senate in 1869 to serve two more 6-year terms before declining to run for re-election in 1880 because of an ailing heart. His last duty as a public servant came in 1881 when [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[James G. Blaine]] convinced President [[James A. Garfield]] to name Hamlin as [[United States Ambassador to Spain]]. Hamlin received the appointment on June 30, 1881, and held the post until October 17, 1882.\n\nUpon returning from Spain, Hamlin retired from public life to his home in [[Bangor, Maine]], which he had purchased in 1851. The [[Hannibal Hamlin House]] \u2013 as it is known today \u2013 is located in central Bangor at 15 5th Street; incorporating [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]], [[Italianate architecture|Italianate]], and [[Mansard roof|Mansard]]-style architecture, the mansion was posted to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1979.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://landmarkhunter.com/151758-hannibal-hamlin-house|title=The Hannibal Hamlin House posted to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979|accessdate=November 13, 2011}}</ref>\n\nHamlin was elected as a Third Class Companion of the [[Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States]].  Third Class was the MOLLUS division created to recognize civilians who had contributed outstanding service to the Union during the war.\n\n==Death==\n\nOn [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]], July 4, 1891, Hamlin collapsed and fell unconscious while playing cards at the Tarratine Club he founded in downtown Bangor. He was then placed on one of the club's couches and died a few hours later. He was 81.

Charles and Cyrus served in the Union forces during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], both becoming generals, Charles by [[brevet (military)|brevet]].  Cyrus was among the first Union officers to argue for the enlistment of black troops, and himself commanded a brigade of freedmen in the Mississippi River campaign. Charles and sister Sarah were present at [[Ford's Theater]] the night of [[Abraham Lincoln assassination|Lincoln's assassination]]. Hannibal Emery Hamlin was [[Maine Attorney General]] from 1905 to 1908.

All homeostatic control mechanisms have at least three interdependent components for the variable being regulated: a receptor, a control centre, and an effector. The receptor is the sensing component that monitors and responds to changes in the environment, either external or internal. Receptors include [[thermoreceptor]]s, and [[mechanoreceptor]]s. Control centres include the [[respiratory centre]], and the [[renin\u2013angiotensin system]]. An effector is the target acted on, to bring about the change back to the normal state. At the cellular level, receptors include [[nuclear receptor]]s that bring about changes in [[gene expression]] through up-regulation or down-regulation, and act in [[negative feedback]] mechanisms. An example of this is in the control of [[bile acid]]s in the [[liver]].<ref name=\"Kalaany\">{{cite journal|last1=Kalaany|first1=NY|last2=Mangelsdorf|first2=DJ|title=LXRS and FXR: the yin and yang of cholesterol and fat metabolism.|journal=Annual Review of Physiology|date=2006|volume=68|pages=159\u201391|doi=10.1146/annurev.physiol.68.033104.152158|pmid=16460270}}</ref>\n\nSome centres, such as the [[renin\u2013angiotensin system]], control more than one variable.

The control center  responds to the signal by determining an appropriate response and sending signals to an [[Effector cell|effector]], which can be one or more muscles, an organ, or a gland.

However, a great many other homeostatic mechanisms, encompassing many aspects of [[human physiology]], control other entities in the body.

The medulla oblongata then distributes messages along [[Motor neuron|motor or efferent nerves]] belonging to the [[autonomic nervous system]] to a wide variety of effector organs, whose activity is consequently changed to reverse the error in the blood pressure. One of the effector organs is the heart whose rate is stimulated to rise ([[tachycardia]]) when the arterial blood pressure falls, or to slow down ([[bradycardia]]) when the pressure rises above set point.<ref name=tortora2 /> Thus the heart rate (for which there is no sensor in the body) is not homeostatically controlled, but is one of effector responses to errors in the arterial blood pressure. Another example is the rate of [[sweating]]. This is one of the effectors in the homeostatic control of body temperature, and therefore highly variable in rough proportion to the heat load that threatens to destabilize the body's core

The liver is inhibited from producing [[glucose]], taking it up instead, and converting it to [[glycogen]] and [[triglycerides]]. The glycogen is stored in the liver, but the triglycerides are secreted into the blood as [[very low-density lipoprotein]] (VLDL) particles which are taken up by [[adipose tissue]], there to be stored as fats. The fat cells take up glucose through special glucose transporters ([[GLUT4]]), whose numbers in the cell wall are increased as a direct effect of insulin acting on these cells. The glucose that enters the fat cells in this manner is converted into triglycerides (via the same metabolic pathways as are used by the liver) and then stored in those fat cells together with the VLDL-derived triglycerides that were made in the liver.

The arterioles are the main resistance vessels in the [[arterial tree]], and small changes in diameter cause large changes in the resistance to flow through them. When the arterial blood pressure rises the arterioles are stimulated to [[vasodilation|dilate]] making it easier for blood to leave the arteries, thus deflating them, and bringing the blood pressure down, back to normal. At the same time the heart is stimulated via [[cholinergic]] [[Parasympathetic nervous system|parasympathetic nerves]] to beat more slowly (called [[bradycardia]]), ensuring that the inflow of blood into the arteries is reduced, thus adding to the reduction in pressure, and correction of the original error.\n\nLow pressure in the arteries, causes the opposite reflex of constriction of the arterioles, and a speeding up of the heart rate (called [[tachycardia]]). If the drop in blood pressure is very rapid or excessive, the medulla oblongata stimulates the [[adrenal medulla]], via \"preganglionic\" [[sympathetic nerves]], to secrete [[epinephrine]] (adrenaline) into the blood. This hormone enhances the tachycardia and causes severe [[vasoconstriction]] of the arterioles to all but the essential organ in the body (especially the heart, lungs and brain).

The sensors for the second are the [[parafollicular cells]] in the [[thyroid gland]]. The parathyroid chief cells secrete [[parathyroid hormone]] (PTH) in response to a fall in the plasma ionized calcium level; the parafollicular cells of the thyroid gland secrete [[calcitonin]] in response to a rise in the  plasma ionized calcium level.\n\nThe effector organs of the first homeostatic mechanism are the [[bone]]s, the [[kidney]], and, via a hormone released into the blood by the kidney in response to high PTH levels in the blood, the [[duodenum]] and [[jejunum]]. Parathyroid hormone (in high concentrations in the blood) causes [[bone resorption]], releasing calcium  into the plasma. This is a very rapid action which can correct a threatening [[hypocalcemia]] within minutes. High PTH concentrations cause the excretion of [[Phosphate|phosphate ions]] via the urine. Since phosphates combine with calcium ions to form insoluble salts, a decrease in the level of phosphates in the blood, releases free calcium ions into the plasma ionized calcium pool. PTH has a second action on the kidneys. It stimulates the manufacture and release, by the kidneys, of [[calcitriol]] into the blood. This [[steroid]] hormone acts on the epithelial cells of the upper small intestine, increasing their capacity to absorb calcium from the gut contents into the blood.<ref>{{cite book |last1= Stryer |first1= Lubert | title=In: Biochemistry. |chapter= Vitamin D is derived from cholesterol by the ring-splitting action of light.|page=707 |edition=  Fourth |location= New York |publisher= W.H.

This hormone acts primarily on bone, causing the rapid removal of calcium from the blood and depositing it, in insoluble form, in the bones.\n\nThe two homeostatic mechanisms working through PTH on the one hand, and calcitonin on the other can very rapidly correct any impending error in the plasma ionized calcium level by either removing calcium from the blood and depositing it in the skeleton, or by removing calcium from it.

However, when the blood circulates through the lungs a pulmonary capillary [[Endothelium|endothelial]] enzyme called [[angiotensin-converting enzyme]] (ACE) cleaves a further two amino acids from angiotensin I to form an octapeptide known as [[Angiotensin#Angiotensin II|angiotensin II]].  Angiotensin II is a hormone which acts on the [[adrenal cortex]], causing the release into the blood of the [[steroid hormone]], [[aldosterone]]. Angiotensin II also acts on the smooth muscle in the walls of the arterioles causing these small diameter vessels to constrict, thereby restricting the outflow of blood from the arterial tree, causing the arterial blood pressure to rise. This therefore reinforces the measures described above (under the heading of \"Arterial blood pressure\"), which defend the arterial blood pressure against changes, especially [[hypotension]].\n\nThe angiotensin II-stimulated [[aldosterone]] released from the [[zona glomerulosa]] of the [[adrenal glands]] has an effect on particularly the epithelial cells of the [[distal convoluted tubules]] and [[collecting ducts]] of the kidneys.

The hyponatremia can only be ''corrected'' by the consumption of salt in the diet. However, it is not certain whether a \"salt hunger\" can be initiated by hyponatremia, or by what mechanism this might come about.\n\nWhen the plasma sodium ion concentration is higher than normal ([[hypernatremia]]), the release of renin from the juxtaglomerular apparatus is halted, ceasing the production of angiotensin II, and its consequent aldosterone-release into the blood. The kidneys respond by excreting sodium ions into the urine, thereby normalizing the plasma sodium ion concentration. The low angiotensin II levels in the blood lower the arterial blood pressure as an inevitable concomitant response.\n\nThe reabsorption of sodium ions from the tubular fluid as a result of high aldosterone levels in the blood does not, of itself, cause renal tubular water to be returned to the blood from the [[distal convoluted tubule]]s or [[collecting duct]]s. This is because sodium is reabsorbed in exchange for potassium and therefore causes only a modest change in the [[Osmotic pressure|osmotic gradient]] between the blood and the tubular fluid. Furthermore, the epithelium of the distal convoluted tubules and collecting ducts is impermeable to water in the absence of [[Vasopressin|antidiuretic hormone]] (ADH) in the blood. ADH is part of the control of [[fluid balance]]. Its levels in the blood vary with the [[osmolality]] of the plasma, which is measured in the [[hypothalamus]] of the brain. Aldosterone's action on the kidney tubules prevents sodium loss to the [[extracellular fluid]] (ECF). So there is no change in the osmolality of the ECF, and therefore no change in the ADH concentration of the plasma. However, low aldosterone levels cause a loss of sodium ions from the ECF, which could potentially cause a change in extracellular osmolality and therefore of ADH levels in the blood.\n\n===Potassium concentration===\n{{Main |Potassium#Homeostasis |Potassium in biology}}\nHigh potassium concentrations in the plasma cause [[depolarization]] of the [[zona glomerulosa]] cells' membranes in the outer layer of the [[adrenal cortex]].<ref name=\"pmid22546854\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Hu C, Rusin CG, Tan Z, Guagliardo NA, Barrett PQ |title=Zona glomerulosa cells of the mouse adrenal cortex are intrinsic electrical oscillators. |journal=J Clin Invest |volume=122 |issue=6 |pages=2046\u20132053 |date=June 2012 |pmid=22546854 |doi=10.1172/JCI61996 |url=http://www.jci.org/articles/view/61996 |pmc=3966877}}</ref> This causes the release of [[aldosterone]] into the blood.\n\nAldosterone acts primarily on the [[distal convoluted tubule]]s and [[collecting duct]]s of the kidneys, stimulating the excretion of potassium ions into the urine.<ref name=tortora3 /> It does so, however, by activating the [[basolateral]] [[Na+/K+-ATPase|Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> pumps]] of the tubular epithelial cells.

[[Fluid balance]] involves keeping the fluid volume stabilised, and also keeping the levels of [[electrolyte]]s in the extracellular fluid stable. Fluid balance is maintained by the process of [[osmoregulation]] and by behaviour. [[Osmotic pressure]] is detected by [[osmoreceptor]]s in the [[median preoptic nucleus]] in the [[hypothalamus]]. Measurement of the plasma [[osmolality]] to give an indication of the water content of the body, relies on the fact that water losses from the body, (through [[Transepidermal water loss|unavoidable water loss through the skin]] which is not entirely waterproof and therefore always slightly moist, [[Breathing#Upper airways|water vapor in the exhaled air]], [[Perspiration|sweating]], [[vomiting]], normal [[feces]] and especially  [[diarrhea]]) are all [[hypotonic]], meaning that they are less salty than the body fluids (compare, for instance, the taste of saliva with that of tears. The latter have almost the same salt content as the extracellular fluid, whereas the former is hypotonic with respect to plasma. Saliva does not taste salty, whereas tears are decidedly salty). Nearly all normal and abnormal losses of [[body water]] therefore cause the extracellular fluid to become [[Tonicity#Hypertonicity|hypertonic]]. Conversely excessive fluid intake dilutes the extracellular fluid causing the hypothalamus to register [[hypotonic hyponatremia]] conditions.\n\nWhen the [[hypothalamus]] detects a hypertonic extracellular environment, it causes the secretion of an antidiuretic hormone (ADH) called [[vasopressin]] which acts on the effector organ, which in this case is the [[kidney]]. The effect of vasopressin on the kidney tubules is to reabsorb water from the [[distal convoluted tubule]]s and [[Collecting duct system|collecting ducts]], thus preventing aggravation of the water loss via the urine. The hypothalamus simultaneously stimulates the nearby [[Thirst|thirst center]] causing an almost irresistible (if the hypertonicity is severe enough) urge to drink water. The cessation of urine flow prevents the [[hypovolemia]] and [[Tonicity#Hypertonicity|hypertonicity]] from getting worse; the drinking of water corrects the defect.\n\nHypo-osmolality results in very low plasma ADH levels. This results in the inhibition of water reabsorption from the kidney tubules, causing high volumes of very dilute urine to be excreted, thus getting rid of the excess water in the body.\n\nUrinary water loss, when the body water homeostat is intact, is a ''compensatory'' water loss, ''correcting'' any water excess in the body. However, since the kidneys cannot generate water, the thirst reflex is the all important second effector mechanism of the body water homeostat, ''correcting'' any water deficit in the body.\n\n===Blood pH===\n[[File:2714_Respiratory_Regulation_of_Blood.jpg|border|right|364x364px]]\n{{Main|Acid\u2013base homeostasis |Acid-base imbalance}}\nThe [[pH#Living systems|plasma pH]] can be altered by respiratory changes in the partial pressure of carbon dioxide; or altered by metabolic changes in the [[carbonic acid]] to [[bicarbonate ion]] ratio. The [[bicarbonate buffer system]] regulates the ratio of carbonic acid  to bicarbonate to be equal to 1:20, at which ratio the blood pH is 7.4 (as explained in the [[Henderson\u2013Hasselbalch equation]]). A change in the plasma pH gives an [[acid\u2013base imbalance]].\nIn [[acid\u2013base homeostasis]] there are two mechanisms that can help regulate the pH. [[Respiratory compensation]] a mechanism of the [[respiratory center]], adjusts the [[PCO2|partial pressure of carbon dioxide]] by changing the rate and depth of breathing, to bring the pH back to normal. The partial pressure of carbon dioxide also determines the concentration of carbonic acid, and the bicarbonate buffer system can also come into play. Renal compensation can help the bicarbonate buffer system.\nThe sensor for the plasma bicarbonate concentration is not known for certain. It is very probable that the renal tubular cells of the distal convoluted tubules are themselves sensitive to the pH of the plasma.{{citation needed |date=November 2017}} The metabolism of these cells produces carbon dioxide, which is rapidly converted to hydrogen and bicarbonate through the action of [[carbonic anhydrase]].<ref name=tortora1 /> When the ECF pH falls (becoming more acidic) the renal tubular cells excrete hydrogen ions into the tubular fluid to leave the body via urine.

The resulting reaction in the plasma is the formation of carbonic acid which is in equilibrium with the plasma partial pressure of carbon dioxide.  This is tightly regulated to ensure that there is no excessive build-up of carbonic acid or bicarbonate. The overall effect is therefore that hydrogen ions are lost in the urine when the pH of the plasma falls. The concomitant rise in the plasma bicarbonate mops up the increased hydrogen ions (caused by the fall in plasma pH) and the resulting excess carbonic acid is disposed of in the lungs as carbon dioxide. This restores the normal ratio between bicarbonate and the partial pressure of carbon dioxide and therefore the plasma pH.\nThe converse happens when a high plasma pH stimulates the kidneys to secrete hydrogen ions into the blood and to excrete bicarbonate into the urine.

To achieve energy homeostasis [[appetite]] is regulated by two hormones, [[grehlin]] and [[leptin]]. Grehlin stimulates hunger and the intake of food and leptin acts to signal satiety (fullness).\n\n==Clinical significance==\nMany diseases are the result of a homeostatic failure. Almost any homeostatic component can malfunction, either as a result of an [[genetic disorder|inherited defect]], an [[inborn error of metabolism]], or an acquired disease. Some homeostatic mechanisms have inbuilt redundancies, which ensures that life is not immediately threatened if a component malfunctions; but sometimes a homeostatic malfunction can result in serious disease, which can be fatal if not treated. A well known example of a homeostatic failure is shown in [[Diabetes mellitus type 1|type 1 diabetes mellitus]]. Here [[blood sugar regulation]] is unable to function because the [[beta cells]] of the [[pancreatic islets]] are destroyed and cannot produce the necessary [[insulin]]. The blood sugar rises in a condition known as [[hyperglycemia]].\n\nThe plasma ionized calcium homeostat can be disrupted by the constant, unchanging, over-production of [[parathyroid hormone]] by a parathyroid [[adenoma]] resulting in the typically features of [[hyperparathyroidism]], namely high plasma ionized Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels and the resorption of bone, which can lead to spontaneous fractures.

The inefficiencies gradually result in an unstable internal environment that increases the risk of illness, and leads to the physical changes associated with aging.<ref name=Marieb/>\n\nVarious [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]] diseases are kept under control by homeostatic compensation, which masks a problem by compensating for it (making up for it) in another way. However, the compensating mechanisms eventually wear out or are disrupted by a new complicating factor (such as the advent of a concurrent acute viral infection), which sends the body reeling through a new cascade of events. Such decompensation unmasks the underlying disease, worsening its symptoms. Common examples include decompensated [[heart failure]], [[kidney failure]], and [[liver failure]].\n\n==Biosphere==\nIn the [[Gaia hypothesis]], [[James Lovelock]]<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lovelock |first1=James | title=Healing Gaia: Practical medicine for the Planet|location=New York |publisher=Harmony Books |publication-date=1991|isbn= 0-517-57848-4}}</ref> stated that the entire mass of living matter on Earth (or any planet with life) functions as a vast homeostatic [[superorganism]] that actively modifies its planetary environment to produce the environmental conditions necessary for its own survival. In this view, the entire planet maintains several homeostats (the primary one being temperature homeostasis). Whether this sort of system is present on Earth is open to debate. However, some relatively simple homeostatic mechanisms are generally accepted. For example, it is sometimes claimed that when atmospheric carbon dioxide levels rise, certain plants may be able to grow better and thus act to remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. However, warming has exacerbated droughts, making water the actual [[limiting factor]] on land. When sunlight is plentiful and atmospheric temperature climbs, it has been claimed that the [[phytoplankton]] of the ocean surface waters, acting as global sunshine, and therefore heat sensors, may thrive and produce more [[dimethyl sulfide]] (DMS). The DMS molecules act as [[cloud condensation nuclei]], which produce more clouds, and thus increase the atmospheric [[albedo]], and this feeds back to lower the temperature of the atmosphere. However, rising sea temperature has stratified the oceans, separating warm, sunlit waters from cool, nutrient-rich waters. Thus, nutrients have become the limiting factor, and plankton levels have actually fallen over the past 50 years, not risen. As scientists discover more about Earth, vast numbers of positive and negative feedback loops are being discovered, that, together, maintain a metastable condition, sometimes within very broad range of environmental conditions.\n\n==Predictive==\n{{main|Predictive homeostasis}}\nPredictive homeostasis is an anticipatory response to an expected challenge in the future, such as the stimulation of insulin secretion by gut hormones which enter the blood in response to a meal.<ref name=koeslag /> This insulin secretion occurs before the blood sugar level rises, lowering the blood sugar level in anticipation of a large influx into the blood of glucose resulting from the digestion of carbohydrates in the gut.<ref>{{cite book | first1 = Walter F. | last1 = Boron | first2 = Emile L. | last2 = Boulpaep | title = Medical physiology: a cellular and molecular approach | year = 2009 | publisher = Saunders/Elsevier | location = Philadelphia, PA | isbn = 9781416031154 | edition=  2nd International | name-list-format = vanc }}</ref> Such anticipatory reactions are open loop systems which are based, essentially, on \"guess work\", and are not self-correcting.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Koeslag |first1=J.H. |last2=Saunders |first2=P.T. |last3=Wessels |first3=J.A. | title=Glucose homeostasis with infinite gain: further lessons from the Daisyworld parable? |journal= Journal of Endocrinology | publication-date=1997 |volume=134 |pages=187\u2013192  }}</ref> Anticipatory responses always require a closed loop negative feedback system to correct the 'over-shoots' and 'under-shoots' to which the anticipatory systems are prone.\n\n==Other fields==\nThe term has come to be used in other fields, for example:\n\n===Risk===\n{{Main|Risk homeostasis}}\nAn [[actuary]] may refer to ''risk homeostasis'', where (for example) people who have anti-lock brakes have no better safety record than those without anti-lock brakes, because the former unconsciously compensate for the safer vehicle via less-safe driving habits.

The English historian and biographer [[John Strype]] did not use the word \"hockey\" when he translated the proclamation in 1720.\n\nThe word ''hockey'' itself is of unknown origin. One supposition is that it is a derivative of ''hoquet'', a [[Middle French]] word for a [[Shepherd's crook|shepherd's stave]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=hockey&searchmode=none |title=Hockey |publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=2011-06-18}}</ref> The curved, or \"hooked\" ends of the sticks used for hockey would indeed have resembled these staves.

The NHL rules are slightly different from those used in Olympic ice hockey over many categories. International ice hockey rules were adopted from Canadian rules in the early 1900s.{{sfn|Podnieks|Szemberg|2007|p=198}}\n\nThe contemporary sport developed in Canada from European and native influences. These included various stick and ball games similar to field hockey, bandy and other games where two teams push a ball or object back and forth with sticks. These were played outdoors on ice under the name \"hockey\" in England throughout the 19th century, and even earlier under various other names.{{sfn|Gid\u00e9n|Houda|Martel|2014|p=}} In Canada, there are 24 reports{{sfn|Gid\u00e9n|Houda|Martel|2014|pp=24, 25, 248}} of hockey-like games in the 19th century before 1875 (five of them using the name \"hockey\"). The [[First indoor hockey game|first organized and recorded game]] of ice hockey was played indoors in [[Montreal|Montreal, Quebec]], Canada, on March 3, 1875, and featured several [[McGill University]] students.\n\n[[Ice hockey stick]]s are long L-shaped sticks made of wood, [[graphite#Uses|graphite]], or [[composite materials|composites]] with a blade at the bottom that can lie flat on the playing surface when the stick is held upright and can legally curve either way, for [[left-handed|left]]- or [[right-handed]] players.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.thesportjournal.org/article/biomechanics-ice-hockey-slap-shots-which-stick-best |title=Biomechanics of Ice Hockey Slap Shots: Which Stick Is Best? |last=Laliberte |first=David J. |work=The Sport Journal |issn=1543-9518 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090806023625/http://www.thesportjournal.org/article/biomechanics-ice-hockey-slap-shots-which-stick-best |archivedate=2009-08-06 |df= }}</ref>\n\n=== Ice sledge hockey ===\n{{Main|Ice sledge hockey}}\nIce sledge hockey or para ice hockey is a form of ice hockey designed for players with physical [[disability|disabilities]] affecting their lower bodies. Players sit on double-bladed [[sled]]ges and use two sticks; each stick has a blade at one end and small picks at the other. Players use the sticks to pass, stickhandle and shoot the puck, and to propel their sledges.

There is no classification point system dictating who can play inline sledge hockey, unlike the situation with other team sports such as wheelchair basketball and wheelchair rugby. Inline sledge hockey is being developed to allow everyone, regardless of whether they have a disability or not, to complete up to world championship level based solely on talent and ability.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} The first game of inline sledge hockey was played at Bisley, England, on 19 December 2009 between the Hull Stingrays and the Grimsby Redwings. [[Matt Lloyd, Paralympic Athlete|Matt Lloyd]] is credited with inventing inline sledge hockey, and Great Britain is seen as the international leader in the game's development.\n\n=== Roller hockey (inline) ===\n{{main|Roller in-line hockey}}\n[[File:Argentin player during 2007 rink hockey world championship.jpg|thumb|right|Rink hockey \u2013 Rollhockey \u2013 Hoquei em Patins]]\n[[Inline hockey]] is a variation of [[roller hockey]] very similar to [[ice hockey]], from which it is derived. Inline hockey is played by two teams, consisting of four skaters and one goalie, on a dry rink divided into two halves by a center line, with one net at each end of the rink. The game is played in three 15-minute periods with a variation of the ice hockey off-side rule. Icings are also called, but are usually referred to as illegal clearing.<ref>For rink dimensions and an overview of the rules of the game, see [http://www.iihf.com/fileadmin/user_upload/PDF/InLineRuleBook2005.pdf IIHF Inline Rules].</ref> The governing body is the [[International Ice Hockey Federation|IIHF]], as for ice hockey, but some leagues and competitions do not follow the IIHF regulations, in particular USA Inline and Canada Inline.\n\n=== Roller hockey (quad) ===\n{{main|Roller hockey (quad)}}\nRoller hockey, also known as quad hockey, international-style ball hockey, and Hoquei em Patins, is an overarching name for a roller sport that has existed since long before inline skates were invented. This sport is played in over sixty countries and has a worldwide following. Roller hockey was a demonstration sport at the [[Barcelona 1992|1992 Barcelona Summer Olympics]].\n\n=== Street hockey ===\n{{main|Street hockey}}\nAlso known as road hockey, this is a dry-land variant of ice and roller hockey played year-round on a hard surface (usually asphalt). A ball is usually used instead of a puck, and protective equipment is not usually worn.\n\n\n==Other forms of hockey==\n[[File:Mapuche Chueca-Alonso Ovalle.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Native [[Mapuche]]s playing [[:es:Pal\u00edn (juego)|pal\u00edn]], shown in ''Hist\u00f3rica Relaci\u00f3n del Reino de Chile'' by [[Alonso de Ovalle]], Rome, 1646]]\nOther games derived from hockey or its predecessors include the following:\n[[File:Boxhockey1935.jpg|thumb|Box Hockey being played in Miami, Florida, 1935]]\n* [[Air hockey]] is played indoors with a puck on an air-cushion table.\n* Beach hockey, a variation of street hockey, is a common sight on [[Southern California]] beaches.\n* [[Ball hockey]] is played in a gym using sticks and a ball, often a [[tennis]] ball with the felt removed.\n* [[Box hockey]] is a schoolyard game played by two people.

It is {{convert|10.0|mi|km|1}} south-west of [[Jedburgh]] and {{convert|8.9|mi|km|1}} south-southeast of [[Selkirk, Scottish Borders|Selkirk]]. It is one of the farthest towns from the sea in Scotland, in the heart of [[Teviotdale]], and the biggest town in the former county of Roxburghshire. Hawick's architecture is distinctive in that it has many [[sandstone]] buildings with [[slate]] roofs. The town is at the\nconfluence of the [[Slitrig Water]] with the [[River Teviot]].  Hawick is known for its yearly [[Common Riding]], for its rugby team [[Hawick RFC|Hawick Rugby Football Club]] and for its [[Knitted fabric|knitwear]] industry.\n\nAt the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 census]] Hawick had a resident population of 14,801.

In the centre of the High Street is the [[Scots Baronial Style architecture|Scots baronial style]] town hall, built in 1886, and the east end has an equestrian statue, known as \"the Horse\", erected in 1914. Drumlanrig's Tower, now a museum, dates largely from the mid-16th century.\nIn 2009 another monument the \"Turning of the Bull\" (artist, Angela Hunter, Innerleithen, Scotland) was unveiled in Hawick. This monument depicts William Rule turning the wild bull as it was charging King Robert the Bruce, thus saving the king's life and beginning the Scottish Clan of Turnbull. A poem written by John Leyden commemorates this historical event. \"His arms robust the hardy hunter flung around his bending horns, and upward wrung, with writhing force his neck retorted round, and rolled the panting monster to the ground, crushed, with enormous strength, his bony skull; and courtiers hailed the man who turned the bull.\"\n\n{{Historical populations\n|title=Population\n|type=Hawick\n|1971|17,251\n|1991|15,704\n|2001|14,573\n|2011|14,294\n|2016|13,730\n|source      =<br/><ref>[http://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/files/census/setloc-ks01.pdf]</ref><ref>[https://www.citypopulation.de/php/uk-scotland.php]</ref><ref>[https://www.scotsman.com/news/plea-for-hawick-a-town-in-deep-trouble-1-517198]</ref>\n}}\n\n== Economy ==\nCompanies: Hawick Cashmere, Hawick Knitwear, [[Johnstons of Elgin]], [[Lyle & Scott]], Peter Scott, [[Pringle of Scotland]], and Scott and Charters, have had and in many cases still have manufacturing plants in Hawick, producing luxury [[cashmere wool|cashmere]] and [[merino]] wool knitwear. The first knitting machine was brought to Hawick in 1771 by John Hardie, building on an existing carpet manufacturing trade.  Originally based on linen, this quickly moved to wool and factories multiplied, driving the growth of the town.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} Engineering firm Turnbull and Scott had their headquarters in an Elizabethan-style listed building on Commercial Road before moving to [[Burnfoot, Scottish Borders|Burnfoot]].<ref>{{cite web|title=16-20 Commercial Road|url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/sc-50816-16-20-even-numbers-commercial-road-turnbu|publisher=British Listed Buildings}}</ref>\n\n== Transport ==\nHawick lies in the centre of the valley of the Teviot.

Hatfield is mentioned in the [[Domesday Book]] as the property of the Abbey of Ely, and unusually, the original census data which compilers of Domesday used still survives, giving us slightly more information than in the final Domesday record.<ref>''Hatfield And Its People'', Workers Educational Association, 13 vols., 1959\u20131966</ref> No other records remain until 1226, when [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] granted the [[Bishop of Ely|Bishops of Ely]] rights to an annual four-day fair and a weekly market. The town was then called [[Bishop's Hatfield]].\n\nHatfield House is the seat of the [[Marquess of Salisbury|Cecil]] family, the Marquesses of Salisbury. [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth Tudor]] was confined there for three years in what is now known as \"The Old Palace\" in Hatfield Park. Legend has it that it was here in 1558, while sitting under an oak tree in the Park, that she learned that she had become Queen following the death of her half-sister, [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary I]]. She held her first Council in the Great Hall (The Old Palace) of Hatfield. In 1851, the route of the Great North Road (now the A1000) was altered to avoid cutting through the grounds of Hatfield House.\n\n{|\n|[[File:Hatfield St Etheldreda.jpg|thumb|Church of St Etheldreda in Old Hatfield.]]\n|}\n\nThe town grew up around the gates of Hatfield House. Old Hatfield retains many historic buildings, notably the Old Palace, [[\u00c6thelthryth|St Etheldreda]]'s Church and [[Hatfield House]]. The Old Palace was built by the Bishop of Ely, [[John Morton (archbishop)|Cardinal Morton]], in 1497, during the reign of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]], and the only surviving wing is still used today for Elizabethan-style banquets. [[St Etheldreda's Church, Hatfield|St Etheldreda's Church]] was founded by the monks from Ely, and the first wooden church, built in 1285, was probably sited where the existing building stands overlooking the old town.\n\n===Aerospace industry===\n[[File:Hatfield, The Comet hotel - geograph.org.uk - 209701.jpg|thumb|The Comet; the carving of the pillar is by [[Eric Kennington]]]]\nIn 1930 the [[de Havilland]] [[Hatfield Aerodrome|airfield and aircraft factory]] was opened at Hatfield and by 1949 it had become the largest employer in the town, with almost 4,000 staff.<ref name=brett/> It was taken over by [[Hawker Siddeley]] in 1960 and merged into [[British Aerospace]] in 1978.<ref>http://hatfieldaviationheritage.co.uk/hatfield-aerodrome/{{dead link|date=November 2016}}</ref> In the 1930s it produced a range of small biplanes. During the [[Second World War]] it produced the [[de Havilland Mosquito|Mosquito]] fighter bomber and developed the [[de Havilland Vampire|Vampire]], the second British production jet aircraft after the Gloster Meteor. After the war, facilities were expanded and it developed the [[de Havilland Comet|Comet]] airliner (the world's first production jet liner), the [[Hawker Siddeley Trident|Trident]] airliner, and an early [[bizjet]], the [[BAe 125|DH125]].\n\nBritish Aerospace closed the Hatfield site in 1993 having moved the [[British Aerospace 146|BAe 146]] production line to [[Woodford Aerodrome]]. The land was used as a film set for [[Steven Spielberg]]'s movie ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]'' and most of the [[BBC]]/[[Home Box Office|HBO]] television drama ''[[Band of Brothers (TV miniseries)|Band of Brothers]]''. It was later developed for housing, higher education, commerce and retail. Part of the former British Aerospace site was intended to be the site of a \u00a3500&nbsp;million new hospital to replace the [[Queen Elizabeth II Hospital]] in Welwyn GC and a new campus for [[Oaklands College]], but both projects were cancelled.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\nToday, Hatfield's aviation history is remembered by the names of certain local streets and pubs (e.g. Comet Way, The Airfield, Dragon Road) as well as ''The Comet Hotel'' (now owned by Ramada) built in the 1930s. ''The Harrier Pub'' (formerly ''The Hilltop'') is actually named after the Harrier bird, not the aircraft, hence the original pub sign showing the bird.

An additional train service calls at all stations to Moorgate in the City of London.\n\nThere was a fatal [[Hatfield rail crash|rail crash]] at Hatfield in 2000, which brought track maintenance deficiencies to public attention.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1482439/Hatfield-crash-was-disaster-waiting-to-happen.html|title=Hatfield crash 'was disaster waiting to happen'|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=31 January 2005|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180210181641/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1482439/Hatfield-crash-was-disaster-waiting-to-happen.html|archivedate=10 February 2018|df=dmy-all}}</ref> A garden beside the [[East Coast Main Line]] was built as a memorial to the crash victims.\n\n==Notable residents==\n{{sources|section|date=July 2017}}\n===Business===\n*[[Michael Birch (businessman)|Michael Birch]] (born 1970), founder of the social network [[BEBO]], lived in Hatfield.\n*[[Geoffrey de Havilland|Sir Geoffrey de Havilland]] (1882\u20131965), founder of De Havilland Aircraft Company\n*[[Jack Olding]] (Henry John Douglas Olding, fl. mid-20th c.), wartime tank and tractor importer, came from Hatfield.\n\n===Music and dance===\n*[[Babe Ruth (band)|Babe Ruth]], a 1970s rock band, came from Hatfield.<ref>[http://www.discogs.com/artist/Babe+Ruth Discogs Babe Ruth] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621134713/http://www.discogs.com/artist/Babe+Ruth |date=21 June 2008 }}; [http://www.bobbyshred.com/baberuth.html Bobby Shred's Babe Ruth Tribute Page.]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060114171826/http://www.bobbyshred.com/baberuth.html |date=14 January 2006 }}</ref>\n*[[Colin Blunstone]] (born 1945) of [[The Zombies]] lived in Hatfield.\n*[[Martin Carthy]] (born 1941), folk musician, was born in Hatfield.\n*[[Sandra Conley]] (born 1943), principal dancer with the Royal Ballet.<ref name=ODD>{{cite web|title=Sandra Conley|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/sandra-conley|website=The Oxford Dictionary of Dance|accessdate=29 October 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112042257/http://www.answers.com/topic/sandra-conley|archivedate=12 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n*[[Donovan]] (born 1946), folk musician, moved to Hatfield at the age of 10 and spent the rest of his childhood there.<ref name=donovan>{{cite book|last=Donovan|first=Leitch|title=The Hurdy Gurdy Man|year=2006|publisher=Arrow|isbn=978-0-09948703-6|page=16}}</ref>\n*[[Barbara Gaskin]] (born 1950), pop singer, No.1 with ''It's My Party''\n*[[Alan Shacklock]] (born 1950), pop musician and record producer, lived in Hatfield.\n*[[Sal Solo]] (Christopher Scott Stevens, born 1961), rock singer, was born in Hatfield.\n*[[Mick Taylor]] (born 1949), [[Rolling Stones]] guitarist 1969\u20131974, grew up in Hatfield.\n*[[Tracey Thorn]] (born 1962), lead singer of [[Everything But The Girl]], was born in Hatfield and attended [[Bishops Hatfield Girls School]].\n\n===Politics, nobility and royalty===\n*[[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury]] (c. 1563\u20131612), statesman\n*[[Robert Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury]] (1830\u20131903), Conservative politician, lived at [[Hatfield House]] and was buried at St Etheldreda Church.\n*[[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 5th Marquess of Salisbury]] (1893\u20131972), Conservative politician\n*[[William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne]] (1779\u20131848), prime minister, was buried at St Etheldreda Church.\n*[[George Stephen, 1st Baron Mount Stephen]] (1829\u20131921) lived at [[Brocket Hall]].\n*[[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston]] (1784\u20131865), prime minister\n*Elizabeth Tudor, later [[Queen Elizabeth I]] (1533\u20131603), lived at Hatfield House (Hatfield Old Palace).\n*[[Malcolm Wicks]] (1947\u20132012), [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] politician and Minister for Energy, was born in Hatfield.\n\n===Religion===\n*[[Walter Curle]] (1575\u20131647), [[Bishop of Winchester]] and a close supporter of [[William Laud]], was born in Hatfield.\n*[[John Morton (archbishop)|John Morton]] (c. 1420\u20131500), Cardinal and [[Bishop of Ely]], built Hatfield Old Palace.\n\n===Science and scholarship===\n*[[L.

It is bordered by [[Bedfordshire]] to the north, [[Cambridgeshire]] to the northeast, [[Essex]] to the east, [[Buckinghamshire]] to the west and [[Greater London]] to the south. For government statistical purposes, it is placed in the [[East of England]] region.\n\nIn 2013, the county had a population of 1,140,700<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Hertfordshire Local Information System|url=http://www.hertslis.org/peoppla/pop/respop/|title=Resident Population|accessdate=10 February 2015}}</ref> living in an area of {{convert|634|sqmi|km2}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hertslis.org/geog/areameas/|publisher=Hertfordshire Local Information System|title=Area Measurements|accessdate=10 February 2015}}</ref> Four towns have between 50,000 and 100,000 residents: [[Hemel Hempstead]], [[Stevenage]], [[Watford]] and [[St Albans]]. [[Hertford]], once the main [[market town]] for the medieval agricultural county, derives its name from a [[wikt:hart|hart]] (stag) and a [[ford (crossing)|ford]], used as the components of the county's coat of arms and flag.  Elevations are high for the region in the north and west.  These reach over {{convert|800|ft}} in the western projection around [[Tring]] which is in the [[Chilterns]].  The county's borders are approximately the [[drainage divide|watershed]]s of the [[River Colne, Hertfordshire|Colne]] and [[River Lea|Lea]]; both flowing to the south; each accompanied by a canal. Hertfordshire's undeveloped land is mainly agricultural and much is protected by [[Green belt (United Kingdom)|green belt]].\n\nThe county's landmarks span many centuries, ranging from the [[Six Hills]] in the [[New towns in the United Kingdom|new town]] of [[Stevenage]] built by local inhabitants during the [[Roman Britain|Roman]] period, to [[Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden|Leavesden Film Studios]]. The volume of intact medieval and [[Tudor architecture|Tudor buildings]] surpasses London, in places in well-preserved [[conservation area]]s, especially in [[St Albans]] which includes some remains of [[Verulamium]], the town where in the 3rd century an early recorded British martyrdom took place. [[Saint Alban]], a Romano-British soldier, took the place of a Christian priest and was beheaded on Holywell Hill. His martyr's cross of a yellow saltire on a blue background is reflected in the [[Flag of Hertfordshire|flag and coat of arms of Hertfordshire]].\n\nHertfordshire is well-served with motorways and railways, providing good access to [[London]]. The largest sector of the economy of the county is in services.\n\n== History ==\n{{main|History of Hertfordshire}}\nHertfordshire was the area assigned to a fortress constructed at [[Hertford]] under the rule of [[Edward the Elder]] in 913. Hertford is derived from the [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] ''heort ford,'' meaning [[deer]] crossing (of a watercourse). The name Hertfordshire is first recorded in the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' in 1011. Deer feature in many county emblems.\n\nThere is evidence of humans living in Hertfordshire from the [[Mesolithic period]]. It was first farmed during the [[Neolithic period]] and permanent habitation appeared at the beginning of the [[Bronze Age]]. This was followed by tribes settling in the area during the [[Iron Age]].\n\nFollowing the [[Roman conquest of Britain|Roman conquest of Britain in AD 43]], the aboriginal [[Catuvellauni]] quickly submitted and adapted to the Roman life; resulting in the development of several new towns, including [[Verulamium]] (St Albans) where in c. 293 the first recorded British martyrdom is traditionally believed to have taken place. [[Saint Alban]], a Romano-British soldier, took the place of a Christian priest and was beheaded on Holywell Hill. His martyr's cross of a yellow saltire on a blue background is reflected in the [[Flag of Hertfordshire|flag and coat of arms of Hertfordshire]] as the yellow background to the stag or Hart representing the county. He is the Patron Saint of Hertfordshire.\n\nWith the [[End of Roman rule in Britain|departure of the Roman Legions in the early 5th century]], the now unprotected territory was invaded and colonised by the [[Anglo-Saxons]]. By the 6th century the majority of the modern county was part of the [[East Saxon]] kingdom. This relatively short lived kingdom collapsed in the 9th century, ceding the territory of Hertfordshire to the control of the West Anglians of [[Mercia]]. The region finally became an English shire in the 10th century, on the merger of the West Saxon and Mercian kingdoms.\n\nA century later, [[William the Conqueror|William of Normandy]] received the surrender of the surviving senior English Lords and Clergy at [[Berkhamsted]], resulting in a new Anglicised title of [[William the Conqueror]] before embarking on an uncontested entry into London and his coronation at [[Westminster]]. Hertfordshire was used for some of the new Norman castles at [[Bishop's Stortford]], and at [[Kings Langley|King's Langley]], a staging post between London and the royal residence of [[Berkhamsted]].\n\nThe [[Domesday Book]] recorded the county as having nine [[hundred (country subdivision)|hundreds]]. [[Tring (hundred)|Tring]] and [[Danais (hundred)|Danais]] became one{{mdash}}[[Dacorum]]{{mdash}}from Danis Corum or Danish rule harking back to a [[Viking]] not [[Saxons|Saxon]] past. The other seven were [[Braughing]], [[Stevenage|Broadwater]], [[Liberty of St Albans|Cashio]], [[Buntingford|Edwinstree]], [[Hertford]], [[Hitchin]] and [[Odsey]].\n\nThe first shooting-down of a [[zeppelin]] over Great Britain during WW1 happened in Cuffley.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hertsatwar.co.uk/zeppelin-raids-hertfordshire|title=Zeppelin Raids - Herts at War|website=www.hertsatwar.co.uk|access-date=23 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nAs London grew, Hertfordshire became conveniently close to the English capital; much of the area was owned by the [[nobility]] and [[aristocracy]], this [[patronage]] helped to boost the local economy. However, the greatest boost to Hertfordshire came during the [[Industrial Revolution]], after which the population rose dramatically. In 1903, [[Letchworth]] became the world's first [[Garden city movement|garden city]] and [[Stevenage]] became the first town to redevelop under the [[New Towns Act 1946]].\n\nFrom the [[1920s in film|1920s]] until the late [[1980s in film|1980s]], the town of [[Borehamwood]] was home to one of the major British [[film studio]] complexes, including the [[MGM-British Studios]]. Many well-known films were made here including the first three ''[[Star Wars]]'' movies ([[Star Wars (film)|IV]], [[The Empire Strikes Back|V]], & [[Return of the Jedi|VI]]). The studios generally used the name of [[Elstree]]. American director [[Stanley Kubrick]] not only used to shoot in those studios but also lived in the area until his death. ''[[Big Brother UK]]'' and ''[[Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?]]'' have been filmed there. ''[[EastEnders]]'' is filmed at Elstree. Hertfordshire has seen development at [[Leavesden Film Studios]] developed on the Leavesden Aerodrome site; the [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' series]] was filmed here and the 1995 James Bond film ''[[GoldenEye]]''.<ref>[http://www.filmlondon.org.uk/content.asp?CategoryID=836 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807090806/http://www.filmlondon.org.uk/content.asp?CategoryID=836 |date=7 August 2007 }}</ref>\n\nOn 17 October 2000, the [[Hatfield rail crash]] killed four people with over 70 injured.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-11560482|title=Hatfield train crash remembered|date=2010-10-17|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-08-02|language=en-GB}}</ref> The crash exposed the shortcomings of [[Railtrack]], which consequently saw speed restrictions and major track replacement.

The beds dip in a south-easterly direction towards the syncline's lowest point roughly under the [[River Thames]]. The most important formations are the [[Cretaceous]] [[Chalk]], exposed as the high ground in the north and west of the county, forming the [[Chiltern Hills]] and the younger [[Palaeocene]], [[Reading Beds]] and [[Eocene]], [[London Clay]] which occupy the remaining southern part. The eastern half of the county was covered by glaciers during the [[Ice Age]] and has a superficial layer of glacial [[boulder clay]]s.\n\n=== Natural resources and environment ===\n[[File:De Wint, Peter, Cornfields near Tring Station, Hertfordshire, 1847.jpg|thumb|left|[[Peter de Wint]], ''Cornfields near Tring Station, Hertfordshire'', 1847, [[Princeton University Art Museum]]]]\nMuch of the county is given over to agriculture.

In the past, clay has supplied local brick-making and still does in [[Bovingdon]], just south-west of Hemel Hempstead. The chalk that is the bedrock of much of the county provides an [[aquifer]] that feeds streams and is also exploited to provide water supplies for much of the county and beyond. Chalk has also been used as a building material and, once fired, the resultant lime was spread on agricultural land to improve fertility. The mining of chalk since the early 18th century has left unrecorded underground galleries that occasionally collapse unexpectedly and endanger buildings.<ref>{{cite web\n | last =\n | first =\n | authorlink =\n | author2 =\n | title = About the chalk mines\n | work =\n | publisher = Dacorum Borough Council\n | year = 2008\n | url = http://www.dacorum.gov.uk/default.aspx?page=5692\n | doi =\n | accessdate = 7 February 2009 }}\n</ref>\n\nFresh water is supplied to London from [[Ware, Hertfordshire|Ware]], using the [[New River (England)|New River]] built by [[Hugh Myddleton]] and opened in 1613.

She eventually amassed more than 90 van Gogh paintings and 185 drawings, one of the world's largest collections of the artist's work, second only to the [[Van Gogh Museum]] in Amsterdam.

He resisted his father's urging to take up the [[natural sciences]] and became more and more interested in the [[humanities]]. His mother, Emma Karoline Johanna Geiese (1869\u20131904) died of [[diabetes]] while Hans-Georg was four years old, and he later noted that this may have had an effect on his decision to not pursue scientific studies. [[Jean Grondin]] describes Gadamer as finding in his mother \"a poetic and almost religious counterpart to the iron fist of his father\".{{sfn|Grondin|2003|p=21}} Gadamer did not serve during [[World War I]] for reasons of ill health{{sfn|Grondin|2003|p=45}} and similarly was exempted from serving during [[World War II]] due to [[polio]].{{sfn|Grondin|2003|p=46}}\n\nHe grew up and studied classics and philosophy in the [[University of Breslau]]{{sfn|Grondin|2003|p=37}} under [[Richard H\u00f6nigswald]], but soon moved back to the University of Marburg to study with the [[Neo-Kantian]] philosophers [[Paul Natorp]] (his [[doctoral thesis]] advisor) and [[Nicolai Hartmann]]. He defended his [[dissertation]] ''The Essence of Pleasure in Plato's Dialogues'' ({{lang|de|Das Wesen der Lust nach den Platonischen Dialogen}}) in 1922.{{sfn|Cesare|2007|p=5\u20137}}\n\nShortly thereafter, Gadamer moved to [[University of Freiburg|Freiburg University]] and began studying with [[Martin Heidegger]], who was then a promising young scholar who had not yet received a professorship. He and Heidegger became close, and when Heidegger received a position at [[University of Marburg|Marburg]], Gadamer followed him there, where he became one of a group of students such as [[Leo Strauss]], [[Karl L\u00f6with]], and [[Hannah Arendt]]. It was Heidegger's influence that gave Gadamer's thought its distinctive cast and led him away from the earlier neo-Kantian influences of Natorp and Hartmann. Gadamer studied Aristotle both under [[Edmund Husserl]] and under Heidegger.{{sfn|Cesare|2007|p=7\u20138}}\n\nGadamer [[habilitation|habilitated]] in 1929 and spent most of the early 1930s lecturing in Marburg. Unlike Heidegger, who joined the [[Nazi Party]] in May 1933 and continued as a member until the party was dissolved following World War II, Gadamer was silent on [[Nazism]], and he was not politically active during the [[Third Reich]]. Gadamer did not join the Nazis, and he did not serve in the army because of the polio he had contracted in 1922. He joined the [[National Socialist Teachers League]] in August 1933.<ref>Ideologische M\u00e4chte im deutschen Faschismus Band 5: Heidegger im Kontext: Gesamt\u00fcberblick zum NS-Engagement der Universit\u00e4tsphilosophen, George Leaman, Rainer Alisch, Thomas Laugstien, Verlag: Argument Hamburg, 1993, p. 105, {{ISBN|3886192059}}</ref>\n\nIn 1933 Gadamer signed the ''[[w:de:Bekenntnis der deutschen Professoren zu Adolf Hitler|Loyalty Oath of German Professors to Adolf Hitler and the National Socialist State]]''.\n\nIn April 1937 he became a temporary professor at Marburg,<ref>{{cite book|last=De Cesare|first=Donatella|title=Gadamer: A Philosophical Portrait|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QmVdtUFL-ugC&lpg=PA17|year=2013|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=0253007631|page=17}}</ref> then in 1938 he received a professorship at [[Leipzig University]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Dostal|first=Robert|title=The Cambridge Companion to Gadamer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Byz-nfrKQkC&lpg=PA21|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521000416|page=20}}</ref> From an [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]-point of view Gadamer was classified as neither supportive nor disapproving in the \"''SD-Dossiers \u00fcber Philosophie-Professoren\"'' (i.e. SD-files concerning philosophy professors) that were set up by the [[Sicherheitsdienst|SS-Security-Service (SD)]].<ref>Leaman, Georg / Simon, Gerd: Deutsche Philosophen aus der Sicht des Sicherheitsdienstes des Reichsf\u00fchrers SS.

The debate was inconclusive, but marked the beginning of warm relations between the two men. It was Gadamer who secured Habermas's first professorship in the University of Heidelberg.\n\nIn 1968, Gadamer invited [[Tomonobu Imamichi]] for lectures at Heidelberg, but their relationship became very cool after Imamichi alleged that Heidegger had taken his concept of ''[[Dasein]]'' out of [[Okakura Kakuzo]]'s concept of ''das in-der-Welt-sein'' (to be in the [[being in the world]]) expressed in ''[[The Book of Tea]]'', which Imamichi's teacher had offered to Heidegger in 1919, after having followed lessons with him the year before.<ref name=\"Imamichi\">{{cite web |first=Tomonobu |last=Imamichi |title=In Search of Wisdom.

A last meeting between Gadamer and Derrida was held at the Stift of Heidelberg in July 2001, coordinated by Derrida's students Joseph Cohen and Raphael Zagury-Orly.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} This meeting marked, in many ways, a turn in their philosophical encounter. After Gadamer's death, Derrida called their failure to find common ground one of the worst debacles of his life and expressed, in the main obituary for Gadamer, his great personal and philosophical respect. [[Richard J. Bernstein]] said that \"[a] genuine dialogue between Gadamer and Derrida has never taken place.

On March 13, 2002, Gadamer died at Heidelberg's University Clinic at the age of 102.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://geocities.com/fdomauricio/Gadamer.htm |title=Hans-Georg Gadamer, 1900-2002 |last=Marucio |first=Fernando |access-date=21 May 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091018215428/http://geocities.com/fdomauricio/Gadamer.htm |archive-date=18 October 2009 |language=es |work=Geocities}}</ref> He is buried in the K\u00f6pfel cemetery in [[Ziegelhausen]].{{sfn|Cesare|2007|pp=27\u201328}}\n\n==Work==\n\n===Philosophical hermeneutics and ''Truth and Method''===\nGadamer's philosophical project, as explained in ''[[Truth and Method]]'', was to elaborate on the concept of \"[[Hermeneutics|philosophical hermeneutics]]\", which Heidegger initiated but never dealt with at length. Gadamer's goal was to uncover the nature of human understanding. In ''Truth and Method'', Gadamer argued that \"truth\" and \"method\" were at odds with one another. For Gadamer, \"the experience of art is exemplary in its provision of truths that are inaccessible by scientific methods, and this experience is projected to the whole domain of human sciences.\"<ref>Skorin-Kapov, Jadranka (2016), \"The Intertwining of Aesthetics and Ethics: Exceeding of Expectations, Ecstasy, Sublimity,\" Lexington Books, {{ISBN|978-1498524568}}</ref> He was critical of two approaches to the [[human science]]s (''[[Geisteswissenschaft]]en''). On the one hand, he was critical of modern approaches to humanities that modeled themselves on the natural sciences, which simply sought to \u201cobjectively\u201d observe and analyze texts and art. On the other hand, he took issue with the traditional German approaches to the humanities, represented for instance by [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] and [[Wilhelm Dilthey]], who believed that meaning, as an object, could be found within a text through a particular process that allowed for a connection with the author\u2019s thoughts that led to the creation of a text (Schleiermacher),<ref>Schleiermacher, Friedrich D. E. \"The Hermeneutics: Outline of the 1819 Lectures,\" ''New Literary History'', Vol. 10, No. 1, Literary Hermeneutics (Autumn, 1978), 5;10.</ref> or the situation that led to an expression of human inner life (Dilthey).<ref>Palmer, Richard (1969). ''Hermeneutics: Interpretation Theory in Schleiermacher, Dilthey, Heidegger, and Gadamer''. Evanston, IL: Northwestern University Press. p. 98. {{ISBN|9780810104594}}.</ref>\n\nHowever, Gadamer argued meaning and understanding are not objects to be found through certain methods, but are inevitable phenomena.<ref name=\"Palmer, Richard 1969 p. 163\">Palmer, Richard (1969). ''Hermeneutics: Interpretation Theory in Schleiermacher, Dilthey, Heidegger, and Gadamer''. Evanston, IL: Northwestern University Press. p. 163. {{ISBN|9780810104594}}.</ref>  Hermeneutics is not a process in which an interpreter finds a particular meaning, but \u201ca philosophical effort to account for understanding as an ontological\u2014the ontological\u2014process of man.\u201d<ref name=\"Palmer, Richard 1969 p. 163\"/>  Thus, Gadamer is not giving a prescriptive method on how to understand, but rather he is working to examine how understanding, whether of texts, artwork, or experience, is possible at all.  Gadamer intended ''Truth and Method'' to be a description of what we always do when we interpret things (even if we do not know it): \"My real concern was and is philosophic: not what we do or what we ought to do, but what happens to us over and above our wanting and doing\".<ref>Truth and Method 2nd ed. Sheed and Ward, London 1989 XXVIII</ref>\n\nAs a result of [[Martin Heidegger]]\u2019s temporal analysis of human existence, Gadamer argued that people have a so-called historically-effected [[consciousness]] (''wirkungsgeschichtliches Bewu\u00dftsein''), and that they are embedded in the particular history and culture that shaped them. However the historical consciousness is not an object over and against our existence, but \u201ca stream in which we move and participate, in every act of understanding.\u201d<ref>Palmer, Richard (1969). ''Hermeneutics: Interpretation Theory in Schleiermacher, Dilthey, Heidegger, and Gadamer''. Evanston, IL: Northwestern University Press. p. 117. {{ISBN|9780810104594}}.</ref>  Therefore, people do not come to any given thing without some form of preunderstanding established by this historical stream.  The tradition in which an interpreter stands establishes \"prejudices\" that affect how he or she will make interpretations. For Gadamer, these prejudices are not something that hinders our ability to make interpretations, but are both integral to the reality of being, and \u201care the basis of our being able to understand history at all.\u201d<ref>Palmer, Richard (1969). ''Hermeneutics: Interpretation Theory in Schleiermacher, Dilthey, Heidegger, and Gadamer''. Evanston, IL: Northwestern University Press. p. 182. {{ISBN|9780810104594}}.</ref> Gadamer criticized Enlightenment thinkers for harboring a \"prejudice against prejudices\".<ref>Gonzalez, Francisco J, \u201cDialectic and Dialogue in the Hermeneutics of Paul Ricouer and H.G. Gadamer,\u201d ''Continental Philosophy Review'', 39 (2006), 328.</ref>\n\nFor Gadamer, interpreting a text involves a [[fusion of horizons]] (''Horizontverschmelzung'').  Both the text and the interpreter find themselves within a particular historical tradition, or \u201chorizon.\u201d  Each horizon is expressed through the medium of language, and both text and interpreter belong to and participate in history and language.  This \u201cbelongingness\u201d to language is the common ground between interpreter and text that makes understanding possible.  As an interpreter seeks to understand a text, a common horizon emerges.  This fusion of horizons does not mean the interpreter now fully understands some kind of objective meaning, but is \u201can event in which a world opens itself to him.\u201d<ref>Palmer, Richard (1969). ''Hermeneutics: Interpretation Theory in Schleiermacher, Dilthey, Heidegger, and Gadamer''. Evanston, IL: Northwestern University Press. p. 209. {{ISBN|9780810104594}}.</ref>  The result is a deeper understanding of the subject matter.\n\nGadamer further explains the hermeneutical experience as a dialogue.  To justify this, he uses [[Plato#The dialogues|Plato\u2019s dialogues]] as a model for how we are to engage with written texts.  To be in conversation, one must take seriously \u201cthe truth claim of the person with whom one is conversing.\u201d<ref>Gonzalez, Francisco J, \u201cDialectic and Dialogue in the Hermeneutics of Paul Ricouer and H.G. Gadamer,\u201d ''Continental Philosophy Review'', 39 (2006), 322-323.</ref>  Further, each participant in the conversation relates to one another insofar as they belong to the common goal of understanding one another.<ref name=\"Gonzalez, Francisco J 2006\">Gonzalez, Francisco J, \u201cDialectic and Dialogue in the Hermeneutics of Paul Ricouer and H.G. Gadamer,\u201d ''Continental Philosophy Review'', 39 (2006), 323.</ref>  Ultimately, for Gadamer, the most important dynamic of conversation as a model for the interpretation of a text is \u201cthe give-and-take of question and answer.\u201d<ref name=\"Gonzalez, Francisco J 2006\"/>  In other words, the interpretation of a\ngiven text will change depending on the questions the interpreter asks of the\ntext. The \"meaning\" emerges not as an object that lies in the text or in the interpreter, but rather an event that results from the interaction of the two.\n\n''Truth and Method'' was published twice in English, and the revised edition is now considered authoritative. The German-language edition of Gadamer's Collected Works includes a volume in which Gadamer elaborates his argument and discusses the critical response to the book. Finally, Gadamer's essay on [[Paul Celan|Celan]] (entitled \"Who Am I and Who Are You?\") has been considered by many\u2014including Heidegger and Gadamer himself\u2014as a \"second volume\" or continuation of the argument in ''Truth and Method''.\n\n====Contributions to communication ethics====\nGadamer's ''Truth and Method'' has become an authoritative work in the [[communication ethics]] field, spawning several prominent ethics theories and guidelines.  The most profound of these is the formulation of the dialogic coordinates, a standard set of prerequisite communication elements necessary for inciting dialogue.  Adhering to Gadamer's theories regarding bias, communicators can better initiate dialogic transaction, allowing biases to merge and promote mutual understanding and learning.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Communication Ethics Literacy: Dialogue and Difference Arnett, Harden Fritz & Bell, Los Angeles 2009</ref>\n\n===Other works===\nGadamer also added philosophical substance to the notion of human health. In ''The Enigma of Health'', Gadamer explored what it means to heal, as a patient and a provider. In this work the practice and art of medicine are thoroughly examined, as is the inevitability of any cure.<ref name=\"Dostal-intro\">{{Cite book|author=Robert J. Dostal|chapter=Introduction|title=The Cambridge Companion to Gadamer|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2002|isbn=0521801931}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to his work in hermeneutics, Gadamer is also well known for a long list of publications on Greek philosophy. Indeed, while ''Truth and Method'' became central to his later career, much of Gadamer's early life centered around studying Greek thinkers, [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] specifically. In the Italian introduction to ''Truth and Method'', Gadamer said that his work on Greek philosophy was \"the best and most original part\" of his career.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Gadamer: A Philosophical Portrait|author=Donatella Di Cesare|others=Niall Keane (trans.)|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=9780253007636|page=1}}</ref> His book ''Plato's Dialectical Ethics'' looks at the ''[[Philebus]]'' dialogue through the lens of [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] and the philosophy of [[Martin Heidegger]].<ref name=\"Dostal-intro\" />\n\n==Prizes and awards==\n:1971: [[Pour le M\u00e9rite]] and the [[Reuchlin Prize]]\n:1972: [[Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany|Great Cross of Merit with Star of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany]]\n:1979: [[Sigmund Freud Award]] for scientific prose and [[Hegel Prize]]\n:1986: [[Jaspers Prize]]\n:1990: Great Cross of Merit with Star and Sash of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany\n:1993: Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany\n:12 January 1996: appointed an honorary member of the [[Saxon Academy of Sciences]] in [[Leipzig]]\n;Honorary doctorates:\n:1995: [[University of Wroc\u0142aw]]\n:1996: [[University of Leipzig]]\n:1999: [[Philipps-University Marburg]]\n\n==Bibliography==\n;Primary\n*''[[Dialogue and Dialectic: Eight Hermeneutical Studies on Plato]]''.

This came about in spite of initial disapproval by contemporary medical opinion (which worried about women's frail health) and by ''savoir vivre'' guidebooks (which referred the public attention drawn to what was assumed to be the wife's sexual initiation). The most popular honeymoon destinations at the time were the [[French Riviera]] and [[Italy]], particularly its seaside resorts and romantic cities such as [[Rome]], [[Verona]] or [[Venice]]. Typically honeymoons would start on the night of the marriage, with the couple leaving midway through the reception to catch a late train or ship. However, in the 21st century, many couples will not leave until 1\u20133 days after the ceremony and reception. In Jewish traditions, honeymoons are often put off seven days to allow for the seven nights of feasting if the visits to friends and family cannot be incorporated into the trip.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe honeymoon was originally the period following marriage, \"characterized by love and happiness\", as attested since 1546.<ref name=\"oed\">''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', [http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/88181 ''s.v.'']</ref> The word may allude to \"the idea that the first month of marriage is the sweetest.\"<ref>''Merriam-Webster Dictionary'' [https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/honeymoon ''s.v.'']</ref>\n\n<!--Apparently plagiarised quote, see https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2008/nov/18/the-presidential-honeymoon/-->\nAccording to a different version of the Oxford English Dictionary:\n{{quote|\"The first month after marriage, when there is nothing but [[wikt:tenderness|tenderness]] and [[pleasure]]\" ([[Samuel Johnson]]); originally having no reference to the period of a month, but comparing the mutual affection of newly married persons to the changing moon which is no sooner full than it begins to wane; now, usually, the holiday spent together by a newly married couple, before settling down at home.\"}}\n\nToday, ''honeymoon'' has a positive meaning, but originally it may have referred to the inevitable waning of love like a [[moon phase|phase of the moon]]. In 1552, [[Richard Huloet]] wrote:\n{{quote|Hony mone, a term proverbially applied to such as be newly married, which will not fall out at the first, but th'one loveth the other at the beginning exceedingly, the likelihood of their exceadinge love appearing to aswage, ye which time the vulgar people call the hony mone.|Abcedarium Anglico-Latinum pro Tyrunculis<ref name=\"oed\"/>}}\n\nA fanciful 19th-century theory claimed that the word alludes to \"the custom of the higher order of the Teutones... to drink Mead, or Metheglin, a beverage made with ''honey'', for thirty days after every wedding\",<ref>William Pulleyn, ''The Etymological Compendium'', 1853, [https://books.google.com/books?id=NAAXAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA178 p. 178]</ref><ref>[[Ebenezer Cobham Brewer]], ''Dictionary of Phrase and Fable'', 4th edition, 1870?, [https://books.google.com/books?id=8AARAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA413 p. 413]</ref> but the theory is now rejected.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Brohaugh|first1=Bill|title=Everything you know about English is wrong|date=2008|publisher=Sourcebooks|location=Naperville, Ill.|isbn=9781402211355|page=92}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Monger|first1=George P.|title=Marriage customs of the world : an encyclopedia of dating customs and wedding traditions|date=2013|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|isbn=9781598846645|page=352|edition=Expanded 2nd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=avDXAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA352|accessdate=1 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn many modern languages, the word for a honeymoon is a [[calque]] (''e.g.'' French ''lune de miel'') or near-calque of the English.\n\n==Effects==\nOne 2015 scholarly study concluded that going on a honeymoon is associated with a somewhat lower risk of [[divorce]], regardless of how much or little is spent on the honeymoon itself.<ref name=\":0\" />  However, high spending and incurring significant debt on other wedding-related expenses such as [[Engagement ring|engagement rings]] and [[Wedding ceremony|wedding ceremonies]] is associated with a high risk of divorce.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Francis-Tan|first=Andrew|last2=Mialon|first2=Hugo M.|date=2014-09-15|title=\u2018A Diamond is Forever\u2019 and Other Fairy Tales: The Relationship between Wedding Expenses and Marriage Duration|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2501480|language=en|location=Rochester, NY|doi=10.2139/ssrn.2501480}}</ref> \n\n== See also ==\n\n*[[Babymoon]]\n*[[Bride kidnapping]]\n\n==References==\n{{Sister project links \n|voy=Honeymoon travel\n|commonscat=Honeymoons \n|wikt=honeymoon \n|n=no |q=no |s=no |author=no |b=no |v=no}}\n\n<references />\n\n{{Tourism}}\n{{wedding}}\n\n[[Category:Wedding]]\n[[Category:Types of tourism]]\n[[Category:Types of travel]]", "sha1": "l0ff0szmvobcjcdr7lewmfy8hv6puud"}}, {"title": "Harold Kushner", "ns": "0", "id": "13992", "revision": {"id": "853642744", "parentid": "852070070", "timestamp": "2018-08-06T03:08:58Z", "contributor": {"username": "Gene Wilson", "id": "6713489"}, "comment": "/* top */[[Wikipedia:Village pump (policy)/Archive 126#RfC: Religion in biographical infoboxes|RFC on religion in biographical infoboxes]] using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Hatnote|For the mathematician see [[Harold J.

The same institution awarded him a doctoral degree in Bible in 1972. Kushner has also studied at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], taught at [[Clark University]] and the Rabbinical School of the JTS, and received six [[honorary doctorates]].\n\n== Congregational Rabbi ==\nHe served as the congregational rabbi of Temple Israel of Natick, in [[Natick, Massachusetts]] for 24 years and belongs to the [[Rabbinical Assembly]].\n\n== Author ==\nHe is the author of a best selling book on the [[problem of evil]], ''[[When Bad Things Happen to Good People]].'' Written following the death of his son, Aaron, from the premature aging disease [[progeria]], the book deals with questions about human suffering, [[God]], [[omnipotence]] and [[theodicy]].  Aaron was born in 1963 and died in 1977; the book was published in 1981.\n\nKushner has written a number of other popular theological books, such as ''How Good Do We Have to Be?'' (Dedicated to his grandson, Carl), ''To Life!'' and many others. In collaboration with the late [[Chaim Potok]], Kushner co-edited ''Etz Hayim: A Torah Commentary'', the new official [[Torah]] commentary of the [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative movement]], which was jointly published in 2001 by the [[Rabbinical Assembly]] and the [[Jewish Publication Society]]. His ''Living a Life That Matters'' became a best seller in the fall of 2001. Kushner's book, ''The Lord Is My Shepherd'', was a meditation on the [[Psalm 23|Twenty-Third Psalm]] released in 2003.

Heapsort can be thought of as an improved [[selection sort]]: like that algorithm, it divides its input into a sorted and an unsorted region, and it iteratively shrinks the unsorted region by extracting the largest element and moving that to the sorted region. The improvement consists of the use of a [[heap (data structure)|heap]] data structure rather than a linear-time search to find the maximum.<ref>{{cite book |first=Steven |last=Skiena |authorlink=Steven Skiena |title=The Algorithm Design Manual |publisher=Springer |year=2008 |page=109 |chapter=Searching and Sorting |isbn=1-84800-069-3 |quote=[H]eapsort is nothing but an implementation of selection sort using the right data structure.|doi=10.1007/978-1-84800-070-4_4}}<!--DOI for chapter--></ref>\n\nAlthough somewhat slower in practice on most machines than a well-implemented [[quicksort]], it has the advantage of a more favorable worst-case [[big O notation|{{math|O(''n'' log ''n'')}}]] runtime.  Heapsort is an [[in-place algorithm]], but it is not a [[stable sort]].\n\nHeapsort was invented by [[J. W. J. Williams]] in 1964.<ref>{{harvnb|Williams|1964}}</ref> This was also the birth of the heap, presented already by Williams as a useful data structure in its own right.<ref name=\"brass\">{{cite book |first=Peter |last=Brass |title=Advanced Data Structures |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-521-88037-4 |page=209}}</ref> In the same year, [[Robert Floyd|R. W. Floyd]] published an improved version that could sort an array in-place, continuing his earlier research into the [[treesort]] algorithm.<ref name=\"brass\"/>\n\n== Overview ==\nThe heapsort algorithm can be divided into two parts.\n\nIn the first step, a [[Heap (data structure)|heap]] is [[Binary heap#Building a heap|built]] out of the data. The heap is often placed in an array with the layout of a complete [[Binary tree#Types of binary trees|binary tree]]. The complete binary tree maps the binary tree structure into the array indices; each array index represents a node; the index of the node's parent, left child branch, or right child branch are simple expressions.  For a zero-based array, the root node is stored at index 0; if <code>i</code> is the index of the current node, then\n<pre>\n  iParent(i)     = floor((i-1) / 2) where floor functions map a real number to the smallest leading integer.\n  iLeftChild(i)  = 2*i + 1\n  iRightChild(i) = 2*i + 2\n</pre>\n\nIn the second step, a sorted array is created by repeatedly removing the largest element from the heap (the root of the heap), and inserting it into the array. The heap is updated after each removal to maintain the heap property. Once all objects have been removed from the heap, the result is a sorted array.\n\nHeapsort can be performed in place. The array can be split into two parts, the sorted array and the heap. The storage of heaps as arrays is diagrammed [[Binary heap#Heap implementation|here]].  The heap's invariant is preserved after each extraction, so the only cost is that of extraction.\n\n== Algorithm ==\nThe heapsort algorithm involves preparing the list by first turning it into a [[Binary heap|max heap]]. The algorithm then repeatedly swaps the first value of the list with the last value, decreasing the range of values considered in the heap operation by one, and sifting the new first value into its position in the heap. This repeats until the range of considered values is one value in length.\n\nThe steps are:\n# Call the buildMaxHeap() function on the list. Also referred to as heapify(), this builds a heap from a list in O(n) operations.\n# Swap the first element of the list with the final element. Decrease the considered range of the list by one.\n# Call the siftDown() function on the list to sift the new first element to its appropriate index in the heap.\n# Go to step (2) unless the considered range of the list is one element.\nThe buildMaxHeap() operation is run once, and is {{math|O(''n'')}} in performance. The siftDown() function is {{math|O(log&nbsp;''n'')}}, and is called {{mvar|n}} times. Therefore, the performance of this algorithm is {{math|1=O(''n'' + ''n'' log ''n'') = O(''n'' log ''n'')}}.\n\n=== Pseudocode ===\n\nThe following is a critical way to implement the algorithm in [[pseudocode]]. Arrays are [[Comparison of programming languages (array)|zero-based]] and <code>swap</code> is used to exchange two elements of the array. Movement 'down' means from the root towards the leaves, or from lower indices to higher. Note that during the sort, the largest element is at the root of the heap at <code>a[0]</code>, while at the end of the sort, the largest element is in <code>a[end]</code>.\n\n '''procedure''' heapsort(a, count) '''is'''\n     '''input:''' an unordered array ''a'' of length ''count''\n  \n     ''(Build the heap in array a so that largest value is at the root)''\n     heapify(a, count)\n \n     ''(The following loop maintains the [[Loop invariant|invariants]] that a[0:end] is a heap and every element''\n      ''beyond end is greater than everything before it (so a[end:count] is in sorted order))''\n     end \u2190 count - 1\n     '''while''' end > 0 '''do'''\n         ''(a[0] is the root and largest value. The swap moves it in front of the sorted elements.)''\n         swap(a[end], a[0])\n         ''(the heap size is reduced by one)''\n         end \u2190 end - 1\n         ''(the swap ruined the heap property, so restore it)''\n         siftDown(a, 0, end)\n\nThe sorting routine uses two subroutines, <code>heapify</code> and <code>siftDown</code>. The former is the common in-place heap construction routine, while the latter is a common subroutine for implementing <code>heapify</code>.\n \n ''(Put elements of 'a' in heap order, in-place)''\n '''procedure''' heapify(a, count) '''is'''\n     ''(start is assigned the index in 'a' of the last parent node)''\n     ''(the last element in a 0-based array is at index count-1; find the parent of that element)''\n     start \u2190 iParent(count-1)\n     \n     '''while''' start \u2265 0 '''do'''\n         ''(sift down the node at index 'start' to the proper place such that all nodes below''\n         '' the start index are in heap order)''\n         siftDown(a, start, count - 1)\n         ''(go to the next parent node)''\n         start \u2190 start - 1\n     ''(after sifting down the root all nodes/elements are in heap order)''\n \n ''(Repair the heap whose root element is at index 'start', assuming the heaps rooted at its children are valid)\n '''procedure''' siftDown(a, start, end) '''is'''\n     root \u2190 start\n \n     '''while''' iLeftChild(root) \u2264 end '''do'''    ''(While the root has at least one child)''\n         child \u2190 iLeftChild(root)   ''(Left child of root)''\n         swap \u2190 root                ''(Keeps track of child to swap with)''\n \n         '''if''' a[swap] < a[child]\n             swap \u2190 child\n         ''(If there is a right child and that child is greater)''\n         '''if''' child+1 \u2264 end '''and''' a[swap] < a[child+1]\n             swap \u2190 child + 1\n         '''if''' swap = root\n             ''(The root holds the largest element. Since we assume the heaps rooted at the''\n             '' children are valid, this means that we are done.)''\n             '''return'''\n         '''else'''\n             swap(a[root], a[swap])\n             root \u2190 swap            ''(repeat to continue sifting down the child now)''\n\nThe <code>heapify</code> procedure can be thought of as building a heap from the bottom up by successively sifting downward to establish the [[Heap (data structure)|heap property]]. An alternative version (shown below) that builds the heap top-down and sifts upward may be simpler to understand. This <code>siftUp</code> version can be visualized as starting with an empty heap and successively inserting elements, whereas the <code>siftDown</code> version given above treats the entire input array as a full but \"broken\" heap and \"repairs\" it starting from the last non-trivial sub-heap (that is, the last parent node).\n\n[[File:Binary heap bottomup vs topdown.svg|thumb|right|Difference in time complexity between the \"siftDown\" version and the \"siftUp\" version.]]\nAlso, the <code>siftDown</code> version of heapify [[Binary heap#Building a heap|has {{math|''O''(''n'')}} time complexity]], while the <code>siftUp</code> version given below has {{math|''O''(''n'' log ''n'')}} time complexity due to its equivalence with inserting each element, one at a time, into an empty heap.<ref>{{cite web|title=Priority Queues|url=http://faculty.simpson.edu/lydia.sinapova/www/cmsc250/LN250_Weiss/L10-PQueues.htm|accessdate=24 May 2011}}</ref>\nThis may seem counter-intuitive since, at a glance, it is apparent that the former only makes half as many calls to its logarithmic-time sifting function as the latter; i.e., they seem to differ only by a constant factor, which never affects asymptotic analysis.\n\nTo grasp the intuition behind this difference in complexity, note that the number of swaps that may occur during any one siftUp call ''increases'' with the depth of the node on which the call is made. The crux is that there are many (exponentially many) more \"deep\" nodes than there are \"shallow\" nodes in a heap, so that siftUp may have its full logarithmic running-time on the approximately linear number of calls made on the nodes at or near the \"bottom\" of the heap. On the other hand, the number of swaps that may occur during any one siftDown call ''decreases'' as the depth of the node on which the call is made increases. Thus, when the <code>siftDown</code> <code>heapify</code> begins and is calling <code>siftDown</code> on the bottom and most numerous node-layers, each sifting call will incur, at most, a number of swaps equal to the \"height\" (from the bottom of the heap) of the node on which the sifting call is made. In other words, about half the calls to siftDown will have at most only one swap, then about a quarter of the calls will have at most two swaps, etc.\n\nThe heapsort algorithm itself has {{math|''O''(''n'' log ''n'')}} time complexity using either version of heapify.\n\n  '''procedure''' heapify(a,count) is\n      ''(end is assigned the index of the first (left) child of the root)''\n      end := 1\n      \n      '''while''' end < count\n          ''(sift up the node at index end to the proper place such that all nodes above''\n          '' the end index are in heap order)''\n          siftUp(a, 0, end)\n          end := end + 1\n      ''(after sifting up the last node all nodes are in heap order)''\n  \n  '''procedure''' siftUp(a, start, end) '''is'''\n      '''input: ''' ''start represents the limit of how far up the heap to sift.''\n                    ''end is the node to sift up.''\n      child := end \n      '''while''' child > start\n          parent := iParent(child)\n          '''if''' a[parent] < a[child] '''then''' ''(out of max-heap order)''\n              swap(a[parent], a[child])\n              child := parent ''(repeat to continue sifting up the parent now)''\n          '''else'''\n              '''return'''\n\n== Variations ==\n*The most important variation to the basic algorithm is an improvement by Floyd that uses only one comparison in each [[Binary heap#Insert|siftup]] run, which must be followed by a [[Binary heap#Delete|siftdown]] for the original child. The worst-case number of comparisons during the Floyd's heap-construction phase of Heapsort is known to be equal to 2N \u2212 2s<sub>2</sub>(N) \u2212 e<sub>2</sub>(N), where s<sub>2</sub>(N) is the number of 1 bits in the binary representation of N and e<sub>2</sub>(N) is number of trailing 0 bits.<ref>{{citation\n | last1 = Suchenek | first1 = Marek A.\n | title = Elementary Yet Precise Worst-Case Analysis of Floyd's Heap-Construction Program\n | doi = 10.3233/FI-2012-751\n | pages = 75\u201392\n | publisher = IOS Press\n | journal = [[Fundamenta Informaticae]]\n | volume = 120\n | issue = 1\n | year = 2012}}</ref>\n* The standard implementation of Floyd's heap-construction algorithm causes a large number of [[cache miss]]es once the size of the data exceeds that of the [[CPU cache]].

As they show, this modification can allow the algorithm to sort more quickly than {{math|O(''n''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''n'')}} for inputs that are already nearly sorted.\n* Several variants such as [[weak heap]]sort require {{math|''n''log<sub>2</sub>''n''+O(1)}} comparisons in the worst case, close to the theoretical minimum, using one extra bit of state per node.  While this extra bit makes the algorithms not truly in-place, if space for it can be found inside the element, these algorithms are simple and efficient,<ref name=Bojesen00/>{{Rp|40}} but still slower than binary heaps if key comparisons are cheap enough (e.g. integer keys) that a constant factor does not matter.<ref name=Kat2014-11-14P>{{cite conference |title=Seeking for the best priority queue: Lessons learnt |first=Jyrki |last=Katajainen |date=23 September 2013 |conference=Algorithm Engineering (Seminar 13391) |location=Dagstuhl |pages=19\u201320, 24 |url=http://hjemmesider.diku.dk/~jyrki/Myris/Kat2013-09-23P.html}}</ref>\n* Katajainen's \"ultimate heapsort\" requires no extra storage, performs {{math|''n''log<sub>2</sub>''n''+O(1)}} comparisons, and a similar number of element moves.<ref>{{cite conference |title=The Ultimate Heapsort |date=2\u20133 February 1998 |first=Jyrki |last=Katajainen |conference=Computing: the 4th Australasian Theory Symposium |url=http://hjemmesider.diku.dk/~jyrki/Myris/Kat1998C.html |journal=Australian Computer Science Communications |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=87\u201396 |location=Perth }}</ref>  It is, however, even more complex and not justified unless comparisons are very expensive.\n\n=== Bottom-up heapsort ===\nBottom-up heapsort is a variant which reduces the number of comparisons required by a significant factor.  While ordinary heapsort requires {{math|2 ''n'' log<sub>2</sub> ''n'' + ''O''(''n'')}} comparisons worst-case and on average,{{r|Wegener}} the bottom-up variant requires {{math|''n'' log<sub>2</sub> ''n'' + ''O''(1)}} comparisons on average, and {{math|1.5 ''n'' log<sub>2</sub> ''n'' + ''O''(''n'')}} in the worst case.{{r|fleischer}}\n\nThis is accomplished by improving the <code>siftDown</code> procedure.  The change makes little difference to the linear-time heap-building phase, but is significant in the second phase.  Like ordinary heapsort, each iteration of the second phase extracts the top of the heap, {{math|''a''[0]}}, and fills the gap it leaves with {{math|''a''[''end'']}}, then sifts this latter element down the heap.  But this element comes from the lowest level of the heap, meaning it is one of the smallest elements in the heap, so the sift-down will likely take many steps to move it back down. In ordinary heapsort, each step of the sift-down requires two comparisons, to find the minimum of three elements: the new node and its two children.\n\nBottom-up heapsort instead finds the path of largest children to the leaf level of the tree (as if it were inserting \u2212\u221e) using only one comparison per level.  Put another way, it finds a leaf which has the property that it and all of its ancestors are greater than or equal to their siblings.  (In the absence of equal keys, this leaf is unique.)  Then, from this leaf, it searches ''upward'' (using one comparison per level) for the correct position in that path to insert {{math|''a''[''end'']}}.  This is the same location as ordinary heapsort finds, and requires the same number of exchanges to perform the insert, but fewer comparisons are required to find that location.<ref

other sorts ==\nHeapsort primarily competes with [[quicksort]], another very efficient general purpose nearly-in-place comparison-based sort algorithm.\n\nQuicksort is typically somewhat faster due to some factors, but the worst-case running time for quicksort is {{math|O(''n''<sup>2</sup>)}}, which is unacceptable for large data sets and can be deliberately triggered given enough knowledge of the implementation, creating a security risk. See [[quicksort]] for a detailed discussion of this problem and possible solutions.\n\nThus, because of the {{math|O(''n'' log ''n'')}} upper bound on heapsort's running time and constant upper bound on its auxiliary storage, embedded systems with real-time constraints or systems concerned with security often use heapsort, such as the Linux kernel.<ref>https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/lib/sort.c Linux kernel source</ref>\n\nHeapsort also competes with [[merge sort]], which has the same time bounds. Merge sort requires {{math|\u03a9(''n'')}} auxiliary space, but heapsort requires only a constant amount. Heapsort typically runs faster in practice on machines with small or slow [[data cache]]s, and does not require as much external memory. On the other hand, merge sort has several advantages over heapsort:\n* Merge sort on arrays has considerably better data cache performance, often outperforming heapsort on modern desktop computers because merge sort frequently accesses contiguous memory locations (good [[locality of reference]]); heapsort references are spread throughout the heap.\n* Heapsort is not a [[stable sort]]; merge sort is stable.\n* Merge sort [[parallel algorithm|parallelizes]] well and can achieve close to [[linear speedup]] with a trivial implementation; heapsort is not an obvious candidate for a parallel algorithm.\n* Merge sort can be adapted to operate on '''singly''' [[linked list]]s with {{math|O(1)}} extra space. Heapsort can be adapted to operate on '''doubly''' linked lists with only {{math|O(1)}} extra space overhead.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n* Merge sort is used in [[external sorting]]; heapsort is not. Locality of reference is the issue.\n\n[[Introsort]] is an alternative to heapsort that combines quicksort and heapsort to retain advantages of both: worst case speed of heapsort and average speed of quicksort.\n\n== Example ==\nLet { 6, 5, 3, 1, 8, 7, 2, 4 } be the list that we want to sort from the smallest to the largest. (NOTE, for 'Building the Heap' step: Larger nodes don't stay below smaller node parents. They are swapped with parents, and then recursively checked if another swap is needed, to keep larger numbers above smaller numbers on the heap binary tree.)\n[[File:Heapsort-example.gif|350px|thumb|right|An example on heapsort.]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ style=\"text-align: left;\" | 1.

A common implementation of a heap is the [[binary heap]], in which the tree is a binary tree (see figure). The heap data structure, specifically the binary heap, was introduced by [[J. W. J. Williams]] in 1964, as a data structure for the [[heapsort]] sorting algorithm.<ref>{{Citation |first=J. W. J. |last=Williams |author-link=J. W. J.

A heap is not a sorted structure and can be regarded as partially ordered. As visible from the heap-diagram, there is no particular relationship among nodes on any given level, even among the siblings. When a heap is a complete binary tree, it has a smallest possible height\u2014a heap with ''N'' nodes and for each node ''a'' branches always has log<sub>''a''</sub> ''N'' height. A heap is a useful data structure when you need to remove the object with the highest (or lowest) priority.\n\nNote that, as shown in the graphic, there is no implied ordering between siblings or cousins and no implied sequence for an [[Inorder traversal|in-order traversal]] (as there would be in, e.g., a [[binary search tree]]). The heap relation mentioned above applies only between nodes and their parents, grandparents, etc.  The maximum number of children each node can have depends on the type of heap, but in many types it is at most two, which is known as a binary heap.\n\n==Operations==\nThe common operations involving heaps are:\n;Basic\n* ''find-max'' [or ''find-min'']: find a maximum item of a max-heap, or a minimum item of a min-heap, respectively (a.k.a. ''[[Peek (data type operation)|peek]]'')\n* ''insert'': adding a new key to the heap (a.k.a., ''push''<ref>The Python Standard Library, 8.4. heapq \u2014 Heap queue algorithm, [https://docs.python.org/2/library/heapq.html#heapq.heappush heapq.heappush]</ref>)\n* ''extract-max'' [or ''extract-min'']: returns the node of maximum value from a max heap [or minimum value from a min heap] after removing it from the heap (a.k.a., ''pop''<ref>The Python Standard Library, 8.4. heapq \u2014 Heap queue algorithm, [https://docs.python.org/2/library/heapq.html#heapq.heappop heapq.heappop]</ref>)\n* ''delete-max'' [or ''delete-min'']: removing the root node of a max heap [or min heap], respectively\n* ''replace'': pop root and push a new key. More efficient than pop followed by push, since only need to balance once, not twice, and appropriate for fixed-size heaps.<ref>The Python Standard Library, 8.4. heapq \u2014 Heap queue algorithm, [https://docs.python.org/2/library/heapq.html#heapq.heapreplace heapq.heapreplace]</ref>\n\n;Creation\n* ''create-heap'': create an empty heap\n* ''heapify'': create a heap out of given array of elements\n* ''merge'' (''union''): joining two heaps to form a valid new heap containing all the elements of both, preserving the original heaps.\n* ''meld'': joining two heaps to form a valid new heap containing all the elements of both, destroying the original heaps.\n\n;Inspection\n* ''size'': return the number of items in the heap.\n* ''is-empty'': return true if the heap is empty, false otherwise.\n\n;Internal\n* ''increase-key'' or ''decrease-key'': updating a key within a max- or min-heap, respectively\n* ''delete'': delete an arbitrary node (followed by moving last node and sifting to maintain heap)\n* ''sift-up'': move a node up in the tree, as long as needed; used to restore heap condition after insertion. Called \"sift\" because node moves up the tree until it reaches the correct level, as in a [[sieve]].\n* ''sift-down'': move a node down in the tree, similar to sift-up; used to restore heap condition after deletion or replacement.\n\n==Implementation==\nHeaps are usually implemented in an array (fixed size or [[dynamic array]]), and do not require pointers between elements. After an element is inserted into or deleted from a heap, the heap property may be violated and the heap must be balanced by internal operations.\n\n[[File:Heap-as-array.svg|thumb|300px|Example of a complete binary max-heap with node keys being integers from 1 to 100 and how it would be stored in an array.]]\n[[Binary heap]]s may be represented in a very space-efficient way (as an [[implicit data structure]]) using an [[array data structure|array]] alone. The first (or last) element will contain the root. The next two elements of the array contain its children. The next four contain the four children of the two child nodes, etc. Thus the children of the node at position ''n'' would be at positions '''2n''' and '''2n + 1''' in a one-based array, or '''2n + 1''' and '''2n + 2''' in a zero-based array. This allows moving up or down the tree by doing simple index computations. Balancing a heap is done by sift-up or sift-down operations (swapping elements which are out of order). As we can build a heap from an array without requiring extra memory (for the nodes, for example), [[heapsort]] can be used to sort an array in-place.\n\nDifferent types of heaps implement the operations in different ways, but notably, insertion is often done by adding the new element at the end of the heap in the first available free space. This will generally violate the heap property, and so the elements are then sifted up until the heap property has been reestablished. Similarly, deleting the root is done by removing the root and then putting the last element in the root and sifting down to rebalance. Thus replacing is done by deleting the root and putting the ''new'' element in the root and sifting down, avoiding a sifting up step compared to pop (sift down of last element) followed by push (sift up of new element).\n\nConstruction of a binary (or ''d''-ary) heap out of a given array of elements may be performed in linear time using the classic [[Heapsort#Variations|Floyd algorithm]], with the worst-case number of comparisons equal to 2''N'' \u2212 2''s''<sub>2</sub>(''N'') \u2212 ''e''<sub>2</sub>(''N'') (for a binary heap), where ''s''<sub>2</sub>(''N'') is the sum of all digits of the binary representation of ''N'' and ''e''<sub>2</sub>(''N'') is the exponent of 2 in the prime factorization of ''N''.<ref>{{citation\n | last1 = Suchenek | first1 = Marek A.\n | title = Elementary Yet Precise Worst-Case Analysis of Floyd's Heap-Construction Program\n | doi = 10.3233/FI-2012-751\n | pages = 75\u201392\n | publisher = IOS Press\n | journal = Fundamenta Informaticae\n | volume = 120\n | issue = 1\n | year = 2012}}.</ref> This is faster than a sequence of consecutive insertions into an originally empty heap, which is log-linear.{{efn|Each insertion takes O(log(''k'')) in the existing size of the heap, thus <math>\\sum_{k=1}^n O(\\log k)</math>.

Examples of the need for merging include external sorting and streaming results from distributed data such as a log structured merge tree.

(Using extract-max and insert functions of a priority queue are much less efficient.)\n*[[Order statistics]]: The Heap data structure can be used to efficiently find the kth smallest (or largest) element in an array.\n\n==Implementations==\n* The [[C++ Standard Library]] provides the <tt>make_heap</tt>, <tt>push_heap</tt> and <tt>pop_heap</tt> algorithms for heaps (usually implemented as binary heaps), which operate on arbitrary random access [[iterator]]s. It treats the iterators as a reference to an array, and uses the array-to-heap conversion. It also provides the container adaptor <tt>priority_queue</tt>, which wraps these facilities in a container-like class. However, there is no standard support for the replace, sift-up/sift-down, or decrease/increase-key operations.\n* The [[Boost (C++ libraries)|Boost C++ libraries]] include a heaps library. Unlike the STL, it supports decrease and increase operations, and supports additional types of heap: specifically, it supports ''d''-ary, binomial, Fibonacci, pairing and skew heaps.\n* There is a [https://github.com/valyala/gheap generic heap implementation] for [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[C++]] with [[D-ary heap]] and [[B-heap]]  support.

This class implements by default a min-heap; to implement a max-heap, programmer should write a custom comparator. There is no support for the replace, sift-up/sift-down, or decrease/increase-key operations.\n* [[Python (programming language)|Python]] has a [https://docs.python.org/library/heapq.html <tt>heapq</tt>] module that implements a priority queue using a binary heap.

The only direct links in a hierarchy, insofar as they are hierarchical, are to one's immediate superior or to one of one's subordinates, although a system that is largely hierarchical can also incorporate alternative hierarchies. Indirect hierarchical links can extend \"vertically\" upwards or downwards via multiple links in the same direction, following a [[path (graph theory)|path]]. All parts of the hierarchy which are not linked vertically to one another nevertheless can be \"horizontally\" linked through a path by traveling up the hierarchy to find a common direct or indirect superior, and then down again. This is akin to two [[co-worker]]s or [[colleague]]s; each reports to a common superior, but they have the same relative amount of authority. Organizational forms exist that are both alternative and complementary to hierarchy. [[Heterarchy]] is one such form.\n\n==Nomenclature==\n{{see also| Glossary of graph theory| Taxonomy (general)| Structure}}\nHierarchies have their own special vocabulary. These terms are easiest to understand when a hierarchy is diagrammed (see [[#Visualization|below]]).\n\nIn an organizational context, the following terms are often used related to hierarchies:<ref name=\"Dawkins\"/><ref name=\"Architecture\"/>\n* '''[[Entity|Object]]''': one entity (e.g., a person, department or [[concept]] or element of arrangement or member of a set)\n* '''[[System]]''': the entire set of objects that are being arranged hierarchically (e.g., an administration)\n* '''[[Dimension]]''': another word for \"system\" from on-line analytical processing (e.g. cubes)\n* '''[[Element (mathematics)|Member]]''': an (element or object) at any (level or rank) in a (class-system, taxonomy or dimension)\n*'''Terms about Positioning'''\n**'''[[Ranking|Rank]]''': the relative [[value (ethics)|value]], worth, [[complexity]], [[Power (philosophy)|power]], [[importance]], [[authority]], level etc. of an object\n**'''[[wikt:level#Noun|Level]]''': a set of objects with the same rank OR importance\n**'''[[Order of precedence|Ordering]]''': the arrangement of the (ranks or levels)\n**'''Hierarchy''': the arrangement of a particular set of members into (ranks or levels). Multiple hierarchies are possible per (dimension taxonomy or Classification-system), in which selected levels of the dimension are omitted to flatten the structure\n*'''Terms about Placement'''\n**'''[[wikt:hierarch|Hierarch]]''', the apex of the hierarchy, consisting of one single orphan (object or member) in the top level of a dimension. The root of an inverted-tree structure\n**'''[[wikt:member|Member]]''', a (member or node) in any level of a hierarchy in a dimension to which (superior and subordinate) members are attached \n**'''[[wikt:orphan|Orphan]]''', a member in any level of a dimension without a parent member. Often the apex of a disconnected branch. Orphans can be grafted back into the hierarchy by creating a relationship (interaction) with a parent in the immediately superior level\n**'''[[wikt:leaf|Leaf]]''', a member in any level of a dimension without subordinates in the hierarchy\n**'''[[wikt:neighbour|Neighbour]]''': a member adjacent to another member in the same (level or rank). Always a peer.\n**'''[[Superior (hierarchy)|Superior]]''': a higher level or an object ranked at a higher level (A parent or an ancestor)\n**'''[[wikt:subordinate|Subordinate]]''': a lower level or an object ranked at a lower level (A child or a descendent)\n** '''[[Family of sets|Collection]]''': all of the objects at one level (i.e Peers)\n** '''[[wikt:peer|Peer]]''': an object with the same rank (and therefore at the same level)\n** '''[[Interpersonal relationship|Interaction]]''': the relationship between an object and its direct superior or subordinate (i.e. a superior/inferior pair)\n*** a '''direct''' interaction occurs when one object is on a level exactly one higher or one lower than the other (i.e., on a [[tree (graph theory)|tree]], the two objects have a line between them)\n** '''[[Distance (graph theory)|Distance]]''': the minimum number of connections between two objects, i.e., one less than the number of objects that need to be \"crossed\" to trace a [[path (graph theory)|path]] from one object to another\n** '''[[wikt:Span|Span]]''': a [[qualitative data|qualitative]] description of the width of a level when diagrammed, i.e., the number of subordinates an object has\n*'''Terms about Nature'''\n** '''[[wikt:attribute|Attribute]]''': a heritable characteristic of (members and their subordinates) in a level (eg. ''hair-colour'')\n** '''[[wikt:attribute-value|Attribute-value]]''': the specific value of a heritable characteristic (eg. ''Auburn'')\n\nIn a mathematical context (in [[graph theory]]), the [[Glossary of graph theory|general terminology]] used is different.\n\nMost hierarchies use a more specific vocabulary pertaining to their subject, but the idea behind them is the same. For example, with [[data structure]]s, objects are known as [[node (computer science)|nodes]], superiors are called [[parent node|parents]] and subordinates are called [[child node|children]]. In a business setting, a superior is a [[supervisor|supervisor/boss]] and a peer is a [[colleague]].\n\n===Degree of branching===\n[[Degree (graph theory)|Degree]] of [[Bifurcation theory|branching]] refers to the number of direct [[#Terminology|subordinates]] or children an object has (in graph theory, equivalent to the number of other [[vertex (graph theory)|vertices]] connected to via outgoing arcs, in a directed graph) a node has. Hierarchies can be categorized based on the \"maximum degree\", the highest degree present in the system as a whole. Categorization in this way yields two broad classes: ''linear'' and ''branching''.\n\nIn a '''linear hierarchy'''<!--per WP:R#PLA, this SHOULD be bold-->, the maximum degree is 1.<ref name=\"Dawkins\"/> In other words, all of the objects can be visualized in a line-up, and each object (excluding the top and bottom ones) has exactly one direct subordinate and one direct superior. Note that this is referring to the ''objects'' and not the ''levels''; every hierarchy has this property with respect to levels, but normally each level can have an infinite number of objects. An example of a linear hierarchy is the [[hierarchy of life]].\n\nIn a '''branching hierarchy'''<!--per WP:R#PLA, this SHOULD be bold-->, one or more objects has a degree of 2 or more (and therefore the minimum degree is 2 or higher).<ref name=\"Dawkins\"/> For many people, the word \"hierarchy\" automatically evokes an image of a branching hierarchy.<ref name=\"Dawkins\"/> Branching hierarchies are present within numerous systems, including [[organization]]s and [[classification scheme]]s. The broad category of branching hierarchies can be further subdivided based on the degree.\n\nA '''flat hierarchy'''<!--per WP:R#PLA, this SHOULD be bold--> is a branching hierarchy in which the maximum degree approaches infinity, i.e., that has a wide span.<ref name=\"Architecture\">{{cite journal|last=Simon|first=Herbert A.|title=The Architecture of Complexity|journal=[[Proc. Am. Philos. Soc.]]|volume=106|issue=6|date=12 December 1962|pages=467\u2013482|publisher=[[American Philosophical Society]]|issn=0003-049X|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |jstor=985254 |citeseerx=10.1.1.110.961}}{{registration required}}</ref> Most often, systems intuitively regarded as hierarchical have at most a moderate span. Therefore, a flat hierarchy is often not viewed as a hierarchy at all. For example, [[diamond]]s and [[graphite]] are flat hierarchies of numerous [[carbon]] atoms which can be further decomposed into subatomic particles.\n\nAn '''overlapping hierarchy'''<!--per WP:R#PLA, this SHOULD be bold--> is a branching hierarchy in which at least one object has two parent objects.<ref name=\"Dawkins\"/> For example, a [[graduate student]] can have two [[research supervisor|co-supervisors]] to whom the student reports directly and equally, and who have the same level of authority within the [[university]] hierarchy (i.e., they have the same [[list of academic ranks|position]] or [[tenure]] status).\n\n==History of the term==\nPossibly the first use of the English word \"hierarchy\" cited by the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' was in 1880, when it was used in reference to the three orders of three angels as depicted by [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]] (5th\u20136th centuries). Pseudo-Dionysius used the related [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word (\u1f31\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03af\u03b1 ''hierarchia'') both in reference to the [[De Coelesti Hierarchia|celestial hierarchy]] and the [[ecclesiastical hierarchy]].<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07322c.htm CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Hierarchy<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The Greek term \u1f31\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03af\u03b1 means \"rule of a high priest\"<ref>[https://www.etymonline.com/word/hierarchy \"hierarchy\"].

Since hierarchical churches, such as the [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] (see [[Catholic Church hierarchy]]) and [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]] churches, had tables of organization that were \"hierarchical\" in the modern sense of the word (traditionally with [[God in Christianity|God]] as the pinnacle or head of the hierarchy), the term came to refer to similar organizational methods in [[secular]] settings.\n\n==Visualization==<!--if you change this section's title, please also change the wikilinks throughout the article that link to it! -->\n[[File:Maslow's hierarchy of needs.png|thumb|right|200px|[[Maslow's hierarchy of needs|Maslow's hierarchy of human needs]]. This is an example of a hierarchy visualized with a triangle diagram.]]\nA hierarchy is typically depicted as a [[pyramid (geometry)|pyramid]], where the height of a level represents that level's status and width of a level represents the quantity of items at that level relative to the whole. For example, the few [[Board of Directors|Directors]] of a company could be at the [[apex (geometry)|apex]], and the [[Base (geometry)|base]] could be thousands of people who have no subordinates.\n\nThese pyramids are typically diagrammed with a [[tree structure|tree]] or [[triangle]] [[diagram]] (but note that not all triangle/pyramid diagrams are hierarchical, for example, the 1992 [[History of USDA nutrition guides#Food Guide Pyramid|USDA food guide pyramid]]), both of which serve to emphasize the size differences between the levels. An example of a triangle diagram appears to the right. An [[organizational chart]] is the diagram of a hierarchy within an [[organization]], and is depicted in tree form [[#Organizations|below]].\n\nMore recently, as computers have allowed the storage and navigation of ever larger data sets, various methods have been developed to represent hierarchies in a manner that makes more efficient use of the available space on a computer's screen. Examples include fractal maps, [[treemapping|TreeMaps]] and [[Radial tree|Radial Trees]].\n\n==Visual hierarchy==\nIn the design field, mainly graphic design, successful layouts and formatting of the content on documents are heavily dependent on the rules of [[visual hierarchy]]. Visual hierarchy is also important for proper organization of files on computers.\n\nAn example of visually representing hierarchy is through the Nested clusters. The Nested clusters represents hierarchical relationships by using layers of information. The child element is within the parent element, such as in a [[Venn diagram]]. This structure of representing hierarchy is most effective in representing simple relationships. For example, when directing someone to open a file on a computer desktop, one may first direct them towards the main folder, then the subfolders within the main folder. They will keep opening files within the folders until the designated file is located.\n\nFor more complicated hierarchies, the stair structure represents hierarchical relationships through the use of visual stacking. Visually imagine the top of a downward staircase beginning at the left and descending on the right. The child elements are towards the bottom of the stairs and the parent elements are at the top. This structure is effective when representing more complicated hierarchies where steps are not placed in obvious sequences. Further steps are concealed unless all of the steps are revealed in sequence. In the computer desktop example, a file that is being sought after can only be found once another file is opened. The link for the desired file is within another document. All the steps must be completed until the final destination is reached.\n\n==Informal representation==\nIn plain English, a hierarchy can be thought of as a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] in which:<ref name=\"Dawkins\">{{cite conference|last=Dawkins|first=Richard|authorlink=Richard Dawkins|title=Hierarchical organization: a candidate principle for ethology|conference=Growing points in ethology: based on a conference sponsored by St. John's College and King's College, Cambridge|editors=Bateson, Paul Patrick Gordon; Hinde, Robert A.|year=1976|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England|isbn=0-521-29086-4|pages=7\u201354}}</ref>\n# No element is superior to itself, and\n# One element, the ''hierarch'', is superior to all of the other elements in the set.\nThe first requirement is also interpreted to mean that a hierarchy can have no [[Cycle (graph theory)|circular relationships]]; the association between two objects is always [[Transitive relation|transitive]].\nThe second requirement asserts that a hierarchy must have a leader or [[root node|root]] that is common to all of the objects.\n\n==Mathematical representation==\n{{Main|Hierarchy (mathematics)}}\nMathematically, in its most general form, a hierarchy is a [[partially ordered set]] or ''poset''.<ref name=\"Lehmann\">{{cite conference|last=Lehmann|first=Fritz|title=Big Posets of Participatings and Thematic Roles|pages=50\u201374|conference=Conceptual structures: knowledge representation as interlingua\u20144th International Conference on Conceptual Structures, ICCS '96, Sydney, Australia, August 19\u201322, 1996\u2014proceedings\n|isbn=3-540-61534-2|year=1996|publisher=Springer|editor-last=Eklund|editor-first=Peter G.|editor2-last=Ellis|editor2-first=Gerard|editor3-last=Mann|editor3-first=Graham|series=Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence 115|location=Germany}}</ref> The [[#Terminology|system]] in this case is the entire poset, which is constituted of elements. Within this system, each element shares a particular unambiguous property. Objects with the same property value are grouped together, and each of those resulting [[#Terminology|levels]] is referred to as a [[class (set theory)|class]].\n\n\"Hierarchy\" is particularly used to refer to a poset in which the classes are organized in terms of increasing complexity. <!--Mathematically, a hierarchy can be depicted as a [[combinatorial]] [[object]].-->\nOperations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division are often performed in a certain sequence or order. Usually, addition and subtraction are performed after multiplication and division has already been applied to a problem. The use of parenthesis is also a representation of hierarchy, for they show which operation is to be done prior to the following ones. For example:\n(2 + 5) \u00d7 (7 - 4).\nIn this problem, typically one would multiply 5 by 7 first, based on the rules of mathematical hierarchy. But when the parentheses are placed, one will know to do the operations within the parentheses first before continuing on with the problem. These rules are largely dominant in algebraic problems, ones that include several steps in order to solve. The use of hierarchy in mathematics is beneficial in order to quickly and efficiently solve a problem without having to go through the process of slowly dissecting the problem. Most of these rules are now known as the proper way into solving certain equations.\n\n==Subtypes==\n===Nested hierarchy===<!--if you change this title, change the wiki links within the article that link to it!-->\n[[File:Russian-Matroshka no bg.jpg|200px|right|thumb|[[Matryoshka doll]]s, also known as ''nesting dolls'' or ''Russian dolls''. Each doll is encompassed inside another until the smallest one is reached. This is the concept of ''nesting''. When the concept is applied to [[set (mathematics)|sets]], the resulting ordering is a ''nested hierarchy''.]]\nA nested hierarchy or ''inclusion hierarchy'' is a hierarchical ordering of [[nested set]]s.<ref name=\"natsocsci-ch4\">{{cite encyclopedia|title=Hierarchy, Complexity, Society|last=Lane|first=David|pages=81\u2013120|encyclopedia=Hierarchy in Natural and Social Sciences|editor=Pumain, Denise|publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]]|location=New York, New York|year=2006|isbn=978-1-4020-4126-6}}</ref> The concept of nesting is exemplified in Russian [[matryoshka doll]]s. Each doll is encompassed by another doll, all the way to the outer doll. The outer doll holds all of the inner dolls, the next outer doll holds all the remaining inner dolls, and so on. Matryoshkas represent a nested hierarchy where each level contains only one object, i.e., there is only one of each size of doll; a generalized nested hierarchy allows for multiple objects within levels but with each object having only one parent at each level. The general concept is both demonstrated and mathematically formulated in the following example:\n\n: <math> \\text{square} \\subset \\text{quadrilateral} \\subset \\text{polygon} \\subset \\text{shape} \\, </math>\n\nA square can always also be referred to as a quadrilateral, polygon or shape. In this way, it is a hierarchy. However, consider the set of polygons using this classification. A square can ''only'' be a quadrilateral; it can never be a [[triangle]], [[hexagon]], etc.\n\nNested hierarchies are the organizational schemes behind [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomies]] and systematic classifications. For example, using the original [[Linnaean taxonomy]] (the version he laid out in the 10th edition of ''[[Systema Naturae]]''), a human can be formulated as:<ref>{{cite book|title=Systema naturae per regna tria naturae :secundum classes, ordines, genera, species, cum characteribus, differentiis, synonymis, locis|last=Linnaei|first=Carl von|authorlink=Carl Linnaeus|year=1959|edition=10th|language=Latin|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/542#|location=[[Stockholm]]|publisher=Impensis Direct|isbn=0-665-53008-0|accessdate=2011-09-24}}</ref>\n\n: <math>\\text{H. sapiens} \\subset \\text{Homo} \\subset \\text{Primates} \\subset \\text{Mammalia} \\subset \\text{Animalia}</math>\n\nTaxonomies may change frequently (as seen in [[biological classification|biological taxonomy]]), but the underlying concept of nested hierarchies is always the same.\n\nIn many programming taxonomies and syntax models (as well as fractals in mathematics), nested hierarchies, including Russian dolls, are also used to illustrate the properties of [[self-similarity]] and [[recursion]]. Recursion itself is included as a subset of hierarchical programming, and recursive thinking can be synonymous with a form of hierarchical thinking and logic.<ref name=Corballis>{{cite book |first=Michael |last=Corballis |title=The Recursive Mind  |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2011 |isbn=978-0691145471}}</ref>\n\n====Containment hierarchy====\nA containment hierarchy is a direct extrapolation of the [[#Nested hierarchy|nested hierarchy]] concept. All of the ordered sets are still nested, but every set must be \"[[strict subset|strict]]\"\u2014no two sets can be identical. The shapes example above can be modified to demonstrate this:\n\n: <math> \\text{square} \\subsetneq \\text{quadrilateral} \\subsetneq \\text{polygon} \\subsetneq \\text{shape} \\, </math>\n\nThe notation <math> x \\subsetneq y \\, </math> means ''x'' is a subset of ''y'' but is not equal to&nbsp;''y''.\n\nA general example of a containment hierarchy is demonstrated in [[inheritance (computer science)|class inheritance]] in [[object-oriented programming]].\n\nTwo types of containment hierarchies are the ''subsumptive'' containment hierarchy and the ''compositional'' containment hierarchy. A subsumptive hierarchy \"[[wikt:subsume|subsumes]]\" its children, and a compositional hierarchy is \"[[wikt:composed|composed]]\" of its children.

A subsumptive hierarchy can also be defined abstractly as a hierarchy of \"[[concept]]s\".<ref name=\"sys model\"/> For example, with the Linnaean hierarchy outlined above, an entity name like ''Animalia'' is a way to group all the species that fit the [[wikt:conceptualization|conceptualization]] of an animal.\n\n=====Compositional containment hierarchy=====\nA ''compositional'' containment hierarchy is an ordering of the parts that make up a system\u2014the system is \"composed\" of these parts.<ref name=\"Parsons\">{{cite book|last=Parsons|first=David|title=Object Oriented Programming in C++|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2002|pages=110\u2013185|isbn=0-8264-5428-3}}</ref> Most engineered structures, whether natural or artificial, can be broken down in this manner.\n\nThe compositional hierarchy that every person encounters at every moment is the [[hierarchy of life]].

In fact, the last two levels apply to all [[matter]], at least at the [[macroscopic scale]]. Moreover, each of these levels inherit all the properties of their [[#Terminology|children]].\n\nIn this particular example, there are also ''[[emergent properties]]''\u2014functions that are not seen at the lower level (e.g., [[cognition]] is not a property of [[neuron]]s but is of the [[Human brain|brain]])\u2014and a scalar quality (molecules are bigger than atoms, cells are bigger than molecules, etc.). Both of these concepts commonly exist in compositional hierarchies, but they are not a required general property. These ''level hierarchies'' are characterized by bi-directional [[Causality|causation]].<ref name=\"natsocsci-ch4\"/> ''Upward causation'' involves lower-level entities causing some property of a higher level entity; children entities may interact to yield parent entities, and parents are composed at least partly by their children.

Most [[organized religion]]s, regardless of their internal governance structures, operate as a hierarchy under [[God]]. Many [[Christian denomination]]s have an [[autocephalous]] [[ecclesiastical hierarchy]] of leadership. Families are viewed as a hierarchical structure in terms of [[cousinship]] (e.g., first cousin once removed, second cousin, etc.), [[ancestry]] (as depicted in a [[family tree]]) and [[inheritance]] ([[order of succession|succession]] and [[heir]]ship). All the requisites of a well-rounded life and [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] can be organized using [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs|Maslow's hierarchy of human needs]]. [[Learning]] must often follow a hierarchical scheme\u2014to learn [[differential equation]]s one must first learn [[calculus]]; to learn calculus one must first learn [[elementary algebra]]; and so on.

Hierarchies are so infused into daily life that they are viewed as trivial.<ref name=\"Dawkins\"/><ref name=\"electrodynamics\"/>\n\nWhile the above examples are often clearly depicted in a hierarchical form and are classic examples, hierarchies exist in numerous systems where this branching structure is not immediately apparent. For example, most [[postal code]] systems are hierarchical. Using the [[Postal codes in Canada|Canadian postal code system]] as an example, the top level's binding concept is the \"[[forward sortation area|postal district]]\", and consists of 18 objects (letters). The next level down is the \"zone\", where the objects are the digits 0\u20139. This is an example of an [[#Degree_of_branching|overlapping hierarchy]], because each of these 10 objects has 18 parents. The hierarchy continues downward to generate, in theory, 7,200,000 unique codes of the format ''A0A 0A0'' (the second and third letter position allow 20 objects each). Most [[library classification]] systems are also hierarchical. The [[Dewey Decimal Classification|Dewey Decimal System]] is regarded as infinitely hierarchical because there is no finite bound on the number of digits can be used after the decimal point.<ref name=\"Dewey\">{{cite journal|title=Tracking Nuclear Sources|date=May\u2013June 2009|last=Walker|first=Randy|publisher=wellservicingmagazine.com|pages=28\u201330|url=http://wellservicingmagazine.com/sites/default/files/pdfmag/WSM_MAYJUN09.PDF|format=PDF}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}} See also [[Dewey Decimal Classification|Wikipedia article]].</ref>\n\n[[File:Organizational chart.svg|thumb|200px|A simple [[hierarchical organization|organizational hierarchy]] depicted in the form of a [[tree structure|tree]]. Diagrams like this are called [[organizational chart]]s.]]\n\n===Organizations===\n{{Main|Organizational structure|Hierarchical organization}}\n\n[[Organization]]s can be structured as a [[dominance hierarchy]]. In an organizational hierarchy, there is a single person or group with the most [[power (philosophy)|power]] and [[authority]], and each subsequent level represents a lesser authority. Most organizations are structured in this manner, including [[Forms of government|governments]], [[Company|companies]], [[militia]] and [[organized religion]]s. The units or persons within an organization are depicted hierarchically in an [[organizational chart]].\n\nIn a [[reverse hierarchy]], the conceptual [[pyramid (geometry)|pyramid]] of authority is turned upside-down, so that the apex is at the bottom and the base is at the top. This mode represents the idea that members of the higher rankings are responsible for the members of the lower rankings.\n\n=== Life===\n{{Main|Biological organisation#Fundamentals}}\n\nEmpirically,  we observe in nature a large proportion of the (complex) biological systems, they  exhibit hierarchic structure. On theoretical grounds we could expect complex systems to be hierarchies in a world in which complexity had to evolve from simplicity. [[Systems theory|System]] hierarchies analysis performed in the 1950s,<ref>{{harvnb|Evans|1951}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Evans|1956}}</ref> laid the empirical foundations for a [[Branches of science|field]] that would be, from the 1980s, '''hierarchical ecology'''.<ref>{{harvnb|Margalef|1975}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|O'Neill|1986}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Wicken|Ulanowicz|1988}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Pumain|2006}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Jordan|J\u00f8rgensen|2012}}</ref>\n\nThe theoretical foundations are summarized by Thermodynamics.\nWhen [[biological systems]] are modeled as [[physical system]]s, in its most general abstraction, they are [[Thermodynamic system#Open system|thermodynamic open systems]] that exhibit [[self-organisation|self-organised]] behavior, and the [[Set theory|set/subset]] relations between [[dissipative structures]] can be characterized in a hierarchy.\n\n===Computer graphic imaging===\n{{Main|3D modeling}}\n[[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] and [[computer animation]] [[computer program|programs]] mostly use hierarchies for models. On a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[3d modeling|model]] of a [[human]] for example, the [[chest]] is a [[parent]] of the upper left arm, which is a parent of the lower left arm, which is a parent of the [[hand]]. This is used in [[3D modeling|modeling]] and [[animation]] for almost everything built as a 3D [[Digital data|digital]] model.\n\n===Linguistics===\nMany grammatical theories, such as [[phrase-structure grammar]], involve hierarchy.\n\n[[Direct\u2013inverse language]]s such as [[Cree language|Cree]] and [[Mapudungun language|Mapudungun]] distinguish subject and object on [[verb]]s not by different subject and object markers, but via a hierarchy of persons.\n\nIn this system, the three (or four with [[Algonquian languages]]) persons are placed in a hierarchy of [[salience (language)|salience]]. To distinguish which is subject and which object, ''inverse markers'' are used if the object outranks the subject.\n\n===Music===\nThe structure of a musical composition is often understood hierarchically (for example by [[Heinrich Schenker]] (1768\u20131835, see [[Schenkerian analysis]]), and in the (1985) [[Generative theory of tonal music|Generative Theory of Tonal Music]], by composer [[Fred Lerdahl]] and linguist Ray [[Jackendoff]]). The sum of all notes in a piece is understood to be an all-inclusive surface, which can be reduced to successively more sparse and more fundamental types of motion. The levels of structure that operate in Schenker's theory are the foreground, which is seen in all the details of the musical score; the middle ground, which is roughly a summary of an essential contrapuntal progression and voice-leading; and the background or [[Ursatz]], which is one of only a few basic \"long-range counterpoint\" structures that are shared in the gamut of tonal music literature.\n\nThe [[pitch (music)|pitches]] and [[Musical form|form]] of [[Tonality|tonal]] music are organized hierarchically, all pitches deriving their importance from their relationship to a [[Tonic (music)|tonic]] [[Key signature|key]], and secondary themes in other keys are brought back to the tonic in a recapitulation of the primary theme. [[Susan McClary]] connects this specifically in the [[sonata-allegro form]] to the feminist hierarchy of gender (see above) in her book ''Feminine Endings'', even pointing out that primary themes were often previously called \"masculine\" and secondary themes \"feminine.\"\n\n===Ethics, behavioral psychology, philosophies of identity===\n[[File:Hierarchy Of Purposes.jpg|thumb|right|alt=|Career-oriented purposes can be diagrammed using a hierarchy describing how less important actions support a larger goal.]]\nIn [[ethics]], various [[virtues]] are enumerated and sometimes organized hierarchically according to certain brands of [[virtue theory]].\n\nIn some of these random examples, there is an asymmetry of 'compositional' significance between levels of structure, so that small parts of the whole hierarchical array depend, for their meaning, on their membership in larger parts.There is a hierarchy of activities in human life: productive activity serves or is guided by the moral life; the moral life is guided by practical reason; practical reason (used in moral and political life) serves contemplative reason (whereby we contemplate God). Practical reason sets aside time and resources for contemplative reason.\n\nIn the work of diverse theorists such as [[William James]] (1842\u20131910), [[Michel Foucault]] (1926\u20131984) and [[Hayden White]], important critiques of hierarchical [[epistemology]] are advanced. James famously asserts in his work \"Radical Empiricism\" that clear distinctions of type and category are a constant but unwritten goal of scientific reasoning, so that when they are discovered, success is declared. But if aspects of the world are organized differently, involving inherent and intractable ambiguities, then scientific questions are often considered unresolved.\n\nHierarchy in ethics emerged in Western Europe, West Asia and North Africa around the 1600s. In this aspect, the term hierarchy refers to how distinguishable they are from real to unreal. [[Feminists]], [[Marxists]], [[anarchists]], [[communists]], [[critical theorists]] and others, all of whom have multiple interpretations, criticize the hierarchies commonly found within human society, especially in social relationships. Hierarchies are present in all parts of society: in businesses, schools, families, etc. These relationships are often viewed as necessary. Entities that stand in hierarchical arrangements are animals, humans, plants, etc. In some{{Which|date=July 2012}} cultures, God can also be an addition to this hierarchy. However, feminists, Marxists, critical theorists, and others analyze hierarchy in terms of the values and power that it arbitrarily assigns to one group over another. Hierarchical ethics offers a way of logical reasoning that is compatible with religious commitments.

Such hours varied by [[season]], [[latitude]], and [[weather]]. It was subsequently divided into 60 [[minute]]s, each of 60 [[second]]s. Its [[ancient East Asia|East Asian]] equivalent was the [[Chinese Traditional Time System|''shi'']], which was {{frac|12}} of the [[solar time|apparent solar day]]; a similar system was eventually developed in Europe which measured its '''equal''' or '''equinoctial hour''' as {{frac|24}} of such days measured from noon to noon. The minor variations of this unit were eventually smoothed by making it {{frac|24}} of the [[mean solar day]], based on the measure of the sun's transit along the [[celestial equator]] rather than along the [[ecliptic]].

The use of 24 hours for the entire day meant hours varied much less and the clocks needed to be adjusted only a few times a month.\n\n===Modernity===\n{{main|Decimal time|Metric system}}\nThe minor irregularities of the apparent solar day were smoothed by measuring time using the [[mean solar day]], using the Sun's movement along the [[celestial equator]] rather than along the [[ecliptic]]. The irregularities of this time system were so minor that most clocks reckoning such hours did not need adjustment. However, scientific measurements eventually became precise enough to note the effect of [[tidal deceleration]] of the [[Earth]] by the [[Moon]], which gradually lengthens the Earth's days. \n\nDuring the [[French Revolution]], a [[French Revolutionary units|general decimalization of measures]] was enacted, including [[decimal time]] between 1793 and 1795. Under its provisions, the French hour ({{lang-fr|{{linktext|heure}}}}) was {{frac|10}} of the day and divided formally into 100 decimal minutes (''{{lang|fr|minute d\u00e9cimale}}'') and informally into 10 tenths (''{{lang|fr|{{linktext|d\u00e9cime}}}}''). This hour was only briefly in official use, being repealed by the same 1795 legislation that first established the metric system.\n\nThe [[metric system]] bases its measurements of time upon the [[second]], defined since 1952 in terms of the Earth's rotation in {{sc|ad}}{{nbsp}}1900. Its hours are a secondary unit computed as precisely 3,600 seconds.<ref name=sportsillustrated>{{citation |url=http://www.bipm.org/en/publications/si-brochure/ |title=The International System of Units (SI), ''8th ed.'' |contribution-url=http://www.bipm.org/en/publications/si-brochure/table6.html |contribution=Non-SI Units Accepted for Use with the SI, and Units Based on Fundamental Constants (contd.) |publisher=International Bureau of Weights and Measures |date=2014 |location=Paris }}</ref> However, an hour of [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC), used as the basis of most civil time, has lasted 3,601 seconds 27 times since 1972 in order to keep it within 0.9 seconds of [[UT1|universal time]], which is based on measurements of the [[Mean solar time|mean solar day]] at [[0\u00b0 longitude]]. The addition of these seconds accommodates the very gradual slowing of the [[Earth's rotation|rotation]] of the [[Earth]].\n\nIn modern life, the ubiquity of clocks and other timekeeping devices means that segmentation of days according to their hours is commonplace. Most forms of [[employment]], whether [[wage labor|wage]] or [[salary|salaried]] labour, involves compensation based upon measured or expected hours worked. The fight for an [[eight-hour day]] was a part of [[labor movement|labour movement]]s around the world. Informal [[rush hour]]s and [[happy hour]]s cover the times of day when commuting slows down due to congestion or alcoholic drinks are available at discounted prices. The [[hour record]] for the greatest distance travelled by a cyclist within the span of an hour is one of [[cycling]]'s greatest honours.\n\n==Counting hours==\n[[File:Equatorial sundial topview.gif|thumb|Top view of an equatorial sundial.

This animation depicts the motion of the shadow from 3&nbsp;a.m. to 9&nbsp;p.m. on mid-summer's day, when the Sun is at its highest declination (roughly 23.5\u00b0). Sunrise and sunset occur at 3&nbsp;a.m. and 9&nbsp;p.m. respectively on that day at geographical latitudes near 57.5\u00b0, roughly the latitude of Aberdeen or Sitka, Alaska.]]\n\n[[File:Planispheric astrolabe.png|thumb|Planispheric astrolabe designed for the latitude of Varese (Italy)]]\n\nMany different ways of counting the hours have been used. Because sunrise, sunset, and, to a lesser extent, noon, are the conspicuous points in the day, starting to count at these times was, for most people in most early societies, much easier than starting at midnight. However, with accurate clocks and modern astronomical equipment (and the telegraph or similar means to transfer a time signal in a split-second), this issue is much less relevant.\n\n[[Astrolabe]]s, [[sundial]]s, and [[astronomical clock]]s sometimes show the hour length and count using some of these older definitions and counting methods.\n\n=== Counting from dawn ===\nIn ancient and medieval cultures, the counting of hours generally started with sunrise. Before the widespread use of artificial light, societies were more concerned with the division between night and day, and daily routines often began when light was sufficient.{{sfnp|Landes|1983|p=76}}\n\n\"Babylonian hours\", as used on modern sundials, divide the day and night into 24 equal hours, reckoned from the time of sunrise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/aslaksen/projects/sundials/dial_furniture_hours.html |title=Different Classification of Hours |publisher=Math.nus.edu.sg |date= |accessdate=2018-09-20}}</ref>  They are so named from the false belief of ancient authors that the Babylonians divided the day into 24 parts, beginning at sunrise.  In fact, they divided the day into 12 parts (called ''kaspu'' or \"double hours\") or into 60 equal parts.{{sfnp|Holford-Strevens|2005}}\n\n==== Unequal hours ====\nSunrise marked the beginning of the first hour, the middle of the day was at the end of the sixth hour and sunset at the end of the twelfth hour. This meant that the duration of hours varied with the season. In the Northern hemisphere, particularly in the more northerly latitudes, summer daytime hours were longer than winter daytime hours, each being one twelfth of the time between sunrise and sunset. These variable-length hours were variously known as temporal, unequal, or seasonal hours and were in use until the appearance of the mechanical clock, which furthered the adoption of equal length hours.{{sfnp|Landes|1983|p=76}}\n\nThis is also the system used in [[Halakha|Jewish law]] and frequently called \"Talmudic hour\" (''Sha'a Zemanit'') in a variety of texts. The Talmudic hour is one twelfth of time elapsed from sunrise to sunset, day hours therefore being longer than night hours in the summer; in winter they reverse.\n\nThe Indic day began at sunrise. The term ''hora'' was used to indicate an hour. The time was measured based on the length of the shadow at day time. A ''hora'' translated to 2.5 ''pe''. There are 60 ''pe'' per day, 60 minutes per ''pe'' and 60 ''kshana'' (snap of a finger or instant) per minute. ''Pe'' was measured with a bowl with a hole placed in still water. Time taken for this graduated bowl was one ''pe''. Kings usually had an officer in charge of this clock.\n\n=== Counting from sunset ===\nIn so-called \"[[Italy|Italian]] time\", \"Italian hours\", or \"old Czech time\", the first hour started with the sunset [[Angelus]] bell (or at the end of dusk, i.e., half an hour after sunset, depending on local custom and geographical latitude). The hours were numbered from 1 to 24. For example, in Lugano, the sun rose in December during the 14th hour and noon was during the 19th hour; in June the Sun rose during the 7th hour and noon was in the 15th hour. Sunset was always at the end of the 24th hour. The clocks in church towers struck only from 1 to 12, thus only during night or early morning hours.\n\nThis manner of counting hours had the advantage that everyone could easily know how much time they had to finish their day's work without artificial light. It was already widely used in [[Italy]] by the 14th century and lasted until the mid-18th century; it was officially abolished in 1755, or in some regions customary until the mid-19th century.{{efn|There is a trace of that system, for instance, in [[Verdi]]'s [[opera]]s where in ''[[Rigoletto]]'' or in ''[[Un ballo in maschera]]'' midnight is announced by the bell striking 6 times, not 12. But in his last opera, ''[[Falstaff (opera)|Falstaff]]'', strangely, he abandoned that style, perhaps under influence of contemporary trends at end of 19th [[century]] when he composed it, and the midnight bell strikes 12 times.}}\n\nThe system of Italian hours can be seen on a number of clocks in Europe, where the dial is numbered from 1 to 24 in either Roman or Arabic numerals. The [[St mark's clock|St Mark's Clock]] in Venice, and the [[Orloj]] in Prague are famous examples. It was also used in [[Poland]] and [[Bohemia]] until the 17th century.\n\nThe [[Islamic]] day begins at sunset. The first prayer of the day ([[maghrib]]) is to be performed between just after sunset and the end of twilight. Until 1968 Saudi Arabia used the system of counting 24 equal hours with the first hour starting at sunset.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.aramcoworld.com/issue/196902/dinner.at.when.htm|title=Saudi Aramco World :         Dinner At When?|website=archive.aramcoworld.com}}</ref>\n\n=== Counting from noon ===\nFor many centuries, up to 1925, astronomers counted the hours and days from noon, because it was the easiest solar event to measure accurately. An advantage of this method (used in the [[Julian Date]] system, in which a new Julian Day begins at noon) is that the date doesn't change during a single night's observing.\n\n=== Counting from midnight ===\nIn the modern [[12-hour clock]], counting the hours starts at midnight and restarts at noon. Hours are numbered 12, 1, 2, ..., 11. [[solar time|Solar noon]] is always close to 12 noon (ignoring artificial adjustments due to [[time zone]]s and [[daylight saving time]]), differing according to the [[equation of time]] by as much as fifteen minutes either way. At the [[equinox]]es sunrise is around 6&nbsp;a.m. ({{lang-la|ante meridiem}}, before noon), and sunset around 6&nbsp;p.m. ({{lang-la|post meridiem}}, after noon).\n\nIn the modern [[24-hour clock]], counting the hours starts at midnight, and hours are numbered from 0 to 23. Solar noon is always close to 12:00, again differing according to the equation of time. At the equinoxes sunrise is around 06:00, and sunset around 18:00.\n\n== Derived measures==\n* [[air changes per hour]] (ACH), a measure of the replacements of air within a defined space used for [[indoor air quality]]\n* [[ampere-hour]] (Ah), a measure of [[electrical charge]] used in [[electrochemistry]]\n* [[British thermal unit|BTU]]-hour, a measure of power used in the [[electrical power industry|power industry]] and for air conditioners and heaters\n* [[credit hour]], a measure of an academic [[course (education)|course]]'s contracted instructional time per week for a semester\n* [[horsepower-hour]] (hph), a measure of energy used in the railroad industry\n* [[hour angle]], a measure of the angle between the [[meridian (astronomy)|meridian plane]] and the [[hour circle]] passing through a certain point used in the [[equatorial coordinate system]]\n* [[kilometer per hour|kilometre per hour]] ({{frac|km|h}}), a measure of land speed\n* [[kilowatt-hour]] (kWh), a measure of energy commonly used as an electrical billing unit\n* [[knot (unit)|knot]] (kn), a measure of [[nautical mile]]s per hour, used for maritime and aerial speed\n* [[man-hour]], an averaged amount of work performed per person per hour used in productivity analysis\n* [[meter per hour]] ({{frac|m|h}}), a measure of slow speeds\n* [[mile per hour]] (mph), a measure of land speed\n* [[passengers per hour per direction]] (p/h/d), a measure of the capacity of [[public transport]]ation systems\n* [[pound per hour]] (PPH), a measure of [[mass flow]] used for engines' fuel flow\n* [[working hours|work or working hour]], a measure of working time used in various regulations, such as those distinguishing [[part-time|part-]] and [[full-time]] employment and those limiting [[truck driver]]s' [[Drivers' working hours|working hours]] or [[hours of service]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[Horology]]\n* [[Horae]], the deified hours of ancient Greece and Rome\n* [[Hexadecimal time|Hexadecimal hour]], a proposed unit lasting 1{{nbsp}}h 30{{nbsp}}min\n* [[Decimal time|Decimal hour]] or deciday, a French Revolutionary unit lasting 2{{nbsp}}h 24{{nbsp}}min\n* [[Golden Hour (photography)|Golden Hour]] & [[Blue hour|Blue Hour]] in photography\n* [[Metric time]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{noteslist}}\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{citation |title=The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] |ref={{harvid|''OED''}} |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press }}.\n* {{citation |last=Baxter |first=William H. |author2=Laurent Sagart |display-authors=1 |ref={{harvid|Baxter & al.|2014}} |date=2014 |title=Old Chinese: A New Reconstruction |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press }}, available in part here [http://ocbaxtersagart.lsait.lsa.umich.edu].\n* {{citation |last=Clagett |first=Marshall |authorlink=Marshall Clagett |url=https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=xKKPUpDOTKAC&printsec=frontcover |title=Ancient Egyptian Science, ''Vol. II:'' Calendars, Clocks, and Astronomy |date=1995 |publisher=American Philosophical Society |location=Philadelphia |series=''Memoirs of the APS'', No. 214 }}.\n* {{citation |last=Dershowitz |first=Nachum |author2=Edward M.

Some writers {{Who|date=November 2015}} have proposed that Hezekiah served as coregent with his father Ahaz for about 14 years. His sole reign is dated by William F.

In place of this, he centralized the worship of God at the Jerusalem Temple. Hezekiah also defeated the [[Philistines]], \"as far as Gaza and its territory\", ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|18:8|HE}}) and resumed the [[Passover]] pilgrimage and the tradition of inviting the [[Ten Lost Tribes|scattered tribes of Israel]] to take part in a Passover festival. He sent messengers to [[Tribe of Ephraim|Ephraim]] and [[Tribe of Manasseh|Manasseh]] inviting them to Jerusalem for the celebration of the Passover. The messengers, however, were not only not listened to, but were even laughed at; only a few men of [[Tribe of Asher|Asher]], Manasseh, and [[Tribe of Zebulun|Zebulun]] came to the city. Nevertheless, the Passover was celebrated with great solemnity and such rejoicing as had not been in Jerusalem since the days of [[Solomon]].<ref name=je /> Hezekiah is portrayed by the Bible as a great and good king.\n\n=== Political moves and Assyrian invasion ===\n{{Main article|Sennacherib's campaign in Judah}}\n[[File:Assyrian Archers.jpg|thumb|Assyrian archers]]\n\nAfter the death of Assyrian king [[Sargon II]] in 705 BC, Sargon's son [[Sennacherib]] became king of Assyria. In 703 BC, Sennacherib began a series of major campaigns to quash opposition to Assyrian rule, starting with cities in the eastern part of the realm. In 701 BC, Sennacherib turned toward cities in the west. Hezekiah then had to face the invasion of Judah. According to the Bible, Hezekiah did not rely on Egypt for support, but relied on God and prayed to Him for deliverance of his capital city Jerusalem. ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|18:19-22|HE}}; {{bibleverse|2|Kings|18:32-36|HE}}; {{bibleverse|2|Kings|19:14-19|HE}}; {{bibleverse|2|Kings|19:28|HE}}; {{bibleverse|Isaiah|31:1-3|HE}})\n\nThe Assyrians recorded that Sennacherib lifted his siege of Jerusalem after Hezekiah paid Sennacherib tribute. The Bible records that Hezekiah paid him three hundred [[talent (weight)|talents]] of silver and thirty of gold as tribute, even sending the doors of the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]] to produce the promised amount, but, even after the payment was made, Sennacherib renewed his assault on Jerusalem.<ref name=\"Peter J p255-256\">[[Peter J. Leithart]], \"1 & 2 Kings,\" ''Brazos Theological Commentary on the Bible'', p. 255\u2013256, [[Baker Publishing Group]], [[Grand Rapids, MI]] (2006)</ref> Sennacherib surrounded the city and sent his [[Rabshakeh]] to the walls as a messenger. The Rabshakeh addressed the soldiers manning the city wall in Hebrew (''[[:wikt:\u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d3\u05d9\u05ea|Y\u0115huwdiyth]]''), asking them to distrust [[YHWH|Yahweh]] and Hezekiah, claiming that Hezekiah's righteous reforms (destroying the idols and [[High place|High Places]]) were a sign that the people should not trust their god to be favorably disposed ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|18:17\u201335|HE}}). {{bibleverse|2|Kings|19:15|HE}} records that Hezekiah went to the Temple and there he prayed to God.\n\n=== Hezekiah's construction ===\n[[File:Hezekiahs Tunnel.jpg|thumb|left|[[Siloam Tunnel]]]]\nKnowing that Jerusalem would eventually be subject to siege, Hezekiah had been preparing for some time by fortifying the walls of the capital, building towers, and constructing a tunnel to bring fresh water to the city from a spring outside its walls.<ref name=Spar/> He made at least two major preparations that would help Jerusalem to resist conquest: the construction of the [[Siloam Tunnel]], and construction of the [[Broad Wall (Jerusalem)|Broad Wall]].\n\n<blockquote>\"When Sennacherib had come, intent on making war against Jerusalem, Hezekiah consulted with his officers about stopping the flow of the springs outside the city \u2026 for otherwise, they thought, the King of Assyria would come and find water in abundance\" ({{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|32:2\u20134|HE}}).</blockquote> \n\nThe narratives of the Bible state that Sennacherib's army [[Assyrian Siege of Jerusalem|besieged Jerusalem]]. ({{bibleverse||Isaiah|33:1|HE}}; {{bibleverse|2|Kings|18:17|HE}}; {{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|32:9|HE}}; {{bibleverse||Isaiah|36|HE}})\n\n=== Defeat of Sennacherib's army ===\n[[File:Peter Paul Rubens 082.jpg|thumb|''[[The Defeat of Sennacherib]]'', oil on panel by [[Peter Paul Rubens]], seventeenth century]]\nAccording to the biblical record, Sennacherib sent threatening letters warning Hezekiah that he had not desisted from his determination to take the Judean capital. ({{bibleverse|Isaiah|37:9-20|HE}}) Although they besieged Jerusalem, the biblical accounts state that the Assyrians did not so much as \"shoot an arrow there, ... nor cast up a siege rampart against it\", and that God sent out an angel who, in one night, struck down \"a hundred and eighty-five thousand in the camp of the Assyrians,\" sending Sennacherib back \"with shame of face to his own land\".<ref>{{bibleverse|Isaiah|37:33-37|HE}}; {{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|32:21|HE}}</ref>\n\nSennacherib's inscriptions make no mention of the disaster suffered by his forces. But, as Professor [[Jack Finegan]] comments: \"In view of the general note of boasting which pervades the inscriptions of the Assyrian kings, ... it is hardly to be expected that Sennacherib would record such a defeat.\" <ref>See Light From the Ancient Past, 1959, p. 213</ref> The [[Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges]] refers to an \"Egyptian tradition, according to which Sennacherib had already reached [[Pelusium]] in Egypt, when in a single night his army was rendered helpless by a plague of [[Apodemus|field-mice]] which gnawed the bows of the soldiers and the thongs of their shields\".<ref>[http://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/isaiah/37.htm Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges] on Isaiah 37, accessed 10 May 2018, quoting Herodotus, ii. 141</ref> The version of the matter that Sennacherib presents, as found inscribed on what is known as the [[Sennacherib's Annals|Sennacherib Prism]] preserved in the [[University of Chicago Oriental Institute]], in part says: \"As to Hezekiah, the Jew, he did not submit to my yoke ... Hezekiah himself ... did send me, later, to Nineveh, my lordly city, together with 30 talents of gold, 800 talents of silver, ...\" <ref>Ancient Near Eastern Texts, p. 288</ref> This version inflates the number of silver talents sent from 300 to 800; but in other regards it confirms the biblical record and shows that Sennacherib made no claim that he captured Jerusalem. However, Sennacherib presents the matter of Hezekiah's paying tribute as having come after the Assyrian threat of a siege against Jerusalem, whereas the Bible states it was paid before.\n\n=== Death of Sennacherib ===\n[[File:The Flight of Adrammelech Murch.jpg|thumb|left|170px|''The Flight of Adrammelech'', biblical illustration by Arthur Murch]]\nOf Sennacherib's death {{bibleverse|2|Kings|19:37|HE}} says\n\n<blockquote>\"It came about as he was worshiping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer killed him [Sennacherib] with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Ararat.

It was written in cuneiform, the Mesopotamian form of writing of the day. The prism records the conquest of 46 strong towns <ref>James B. Pritchard, ed., ''Ancient Near Eastern Texts Related to the Old Testament'' (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1965) 287\u2013288.</ref> and \"uncountable smaller places,\" along with the siege of Jerusalem where Sennacherib says he just \"shut him up...like a bird in a cage,\"<ref name=\"Archaeological Bible\" /> subsequently enforcing a larger tribute upon him.\n\nThe Hebrew Bible states that during the night, the angel of Jehovah (YHWH Hebrew) brought death to 185,000 Assyrians troops ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|19:35|HE}}), forcing the army to abandon the siege, yet it also records a tribute paid to Sennacherib of 300 silver talents following the siege. There is no account of the supernatural event in the prism.  Sennacherib's account records his levying of a tribute from Hezekiah, the king of Judea, who was within Jerusalem, leaving the city as the only one intact following the exile of the northern ten-tribe kingdom of Israel due to idolatry. (2 Kings 17:22,23; 2 Kings 18:1-8) Sennacherib recorded a payment of 800 silver talents, which suggests a capitulation to end the siege.  However, Inscriptions have been discovered describing Sennacherib\u2019s defeat of the Ethiopian forces. These say: \u201cAs to Hezekiah, the Jew, he did not submit to my yoke, I laid siege to 46 of his strong cities . . . and conquered (them) . . . Himself I made a prisoner in Jerusalem, his royal residence, like a bird in a cage.\u201d (Ancient Near Eastern Texts, p.&nbsp;288) He does not claim to have captured the city. This is consistent with the Bible account of Hezekiah\u2019s revolt against Assyria in the sense that neither account seems to indicate that Sennacherib ever entered or formally captured the city.  Sennacherib in this inscription claims that Hezekiah paid for tribute 800 talents of silver, in contrast with the Bible\u2019s 300, however this could be due to boastful exaggeration which was not uncommon amongst kings of the period. Furthermore, the annals {{unspecific}} record a list of booty sent from Jerusalem to Nineveh.{{sfn|Grayson|1991|p=110}} In the inscription, Sennacherib claims that Hezekiah accepted servitude, and some theorize that Hezekiah remained on his throne as a vassal ruler.{{sfn|Grabbe|2003|p=314}} The campaign is recorded with differences in the Assyrian records and in the biblical [[Books of Kings]]; there is agreement that the Assyrian have a propensity for exaggeration.<ref name=\"Archaeological Bible\" />{{sfn|Grabbe|2003|p=308-309}}\n\nOne theory that takes the biblical view posits that a defeat was caused by \"possibly an outbreak of the bubonic plague\" (303).<ref name =\"Zondervan Handbook\">''Zondervan Handbook to the Bible''.

The Jewish historian [[Josephus]] followed the writings of Herodotus.<ref name=\"Anchor Dictionary\" /> These historians record Sennacherib's failure to take Jerusalem is \"uncontested\".<ref name=\"Anchor Dictionary\" />\n\n== Chronological interpretation ==\nUnderstanding the biblically recorded sequence of events in Hezekiah's life as chronological or not is critical to the contextual interpretation of his reign. According to scholar [[Stephen L. Harris]], chapter 20 of [[2 Kings]] does not follow the events of chapters 18 and 19 (161).<ref name=\"Harris Bible\">Harris, Stephen L. ''Understanding the Bible''. 8th ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, 2011.</ref> Rather, the Babylonian envoys precede the Assyrian invasion and siege. Chapter 20 would have been added during the exile, and Harris says it \"evidently took place before Sennacherib's invasion' when Hezekiah was \"trying to recruit Babylon as an ally against Assyria.'<ref name=\"Harris Bible\" /> Consequently, \"Hezekiah ends his long reign impoverished and ruling over only a tiny scrap of his former domain.'<ref name=\"Harris Bible\" /> Likewise, ''The Archaeological Study Bible'' says, \"The presence of these riches' that Hezekiah shows to the Babylonians \"indicates that this event took place before Hezekiah's payment of tribute to Sennacherib in 701 BC\" (564).<ref name=\"Archaeological Bible\" /> Again, \"Though the king's illness and the subsequent Babylonian mission are described at the end of the accounts of his reign, they must have occurred before the war with Assyria.<ref name=\"Bible Encyclopedia\" /> Thus, Isaiah's chastening of Hezekiah is due to his alliances made with other countries during the Assyrian conflict for insurance. To a reader who interprets the chapters chronologically, it would appear that Hezekiah ended his reign at a climax, but with a scholarly analysis, his end would contrarily be interpreted as a long fall from where he began.\n\n== Other chronological notes ==\nThere has been considerable academic debate about the actual dates of reigns of the Israelite kings. Scholars have endeavored to synchronize the chronology of events referred to in the [[Hebrew Bible]] with those derived from other external sources. In the case of Hezekiah, scholars have noted that the apparent inconsistencies are resolved by accepting the evidence that Hezekiah, like his predecessors for four generations in the kings of Judah, had a coregency with his father, and this coregency began in 729 BC.\n\nAs an example of the reasoning that finds inconsistencies in calculations when coregencies are ''a priori'' ruled out, {{bibleverse|2|Kings|18:10|NIV}} dates the fall of [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Samaria]] (the Northern Kingdom) to the 6th year of Hezekiah's reign. [[William F. Albright]] has dated the fall of the Kingdom of Israel to 721 BC, while [[Edwin R. Thiele|E. R. Thiele]] calculates the date as 723 BC.<ref>Edwin R. Thiele, ''[[The Mysterious Numbers of the Hebrew Kings]]'' (3rd ed.; Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan/Kregel, 1983) pp. 134, 217.</ref> If Abright's or Thiele's dating are correct, then Hezekiah's reign would begin in either 729 or 727 BC. On the other hand, {{bibleverse-nb|2|Kings|18:13|NIV}} states that Sennacherib invaded Judah in the 14th year of Hezekiah's reign. Dating based on Assyrian records date this invasion to 701 BC, and Hezekiah's reign would therefore begin in 716/715 BC.<ref>Leslie McFall, \"A Translation Guide to the Chronological Data in Kings and Chronicles,\" ''Bibliotheca Sacra'' 148 (1991) p. 33. ([https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.btinternet.com/~lmf12/TransGuide.pdf&date=2010-07-19+09:25:20 Link])</ref> This dating would be confirmed by the account of Hezekiah's illness in chapter 20, which immediately follows Sennacherib's departure ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|20|NIV}}). This would date his illness to Hezekiah's 14th year, which is confirmed by Isaiah's statement ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|20:6|NIV}}) that he will live fifteen more years (29 \u2212 15 = 14). As shown below, these problems are all addressed by scholars who make reference to the ancient Near Eastern practice of [[coregency]].\n\nFollowing the approach of [[Julius Wellhausen|Wellhausen]], another set of calculations shows it is probable that Hezekiah did not ascend the throne before 722 BC. By Albright's calculations, [[Jehu]]'s initial year is 842 BC; and between it and Samaria's destruction the ''Books of Kings'' give the total number of the years the kings of Israel ruled as 143 7/12, while for the kings of Judah the number is 165. This discrepancy, amounting in the case of Judah to 45 years (165\u2013120), has been accounted for in various ways; but every one of those theories must allow that Hezekiah's first six years fell before 722 BC. (That Hezekiah began to reign before 722 BC, however, is entirely consistent with the principle that the Ahaz/Hezekiah coregency began in 729 BC.) Nor is it clearly known how old Hezekiah was when called to the throne, although {{bibleverse|2|Kings|18:2|NIV}} states he was twenty-five years of age. His father died at the age of thirty-six ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|16:2|NIV}}); it is not likely that Ahaz at the age of eleven should have had a son. Hezekiah's own son Manasseh ascended the throne twenty-nine years later, at the age of twelve. This places his birth in the seventeenth year of his father's reign, or gives Hezekiah's age as forty-two, if he was twenty-five at his ascension. It is more probable that Ahaz was twenty-one or twenty-five when Hezekiah was born (and suggesting an error in the text), and that the latter was thirty-two at the birth of his son and successor, Manasseh.\n\n[[File:Chludov proclamation.jpg|thumb|right|Miniature from [[Chludov Psalter]]]]\nSince Albright and [[Richard Elliott Friedman|Friedman]], several scholars have explained these dating problems on the basis of a coregency between Hezekiah and his father Ahaz between 729 and 716/715 BC. Assyriologists and Egyptologists recognize that coregency was a practice both in Assyria and Egypt.<ref>William J.

Douglas, ed., ''New Bible Dictionary'' (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 1965) p. 1160.</ref> After noting that coregencies were only used sporadically in the northern kingdom (Israel), Nadav Na'aman writes,\n<blockquote>In the kingdom of Judah, on the other hand, the nomination of a co-regent was the common procedure, beginning from David who, before his death, elevated his son Solomon to the throne. When taking into account the permanent nature of the co-regency in Judah from the time of Joash, one may dare to conclude that dating the co-regencies accurately is indeed the key for solving the problems of biblical chronology in the eighth century BC.\"<ref>Nadav Na'aman, \"Historical and Chronological Notes on the Kingdoms of Israel and Judah in the Eighth Century BC\" ''[[Vetus Testamentum]]'' 36 (1986) p. 91.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAmong the numerous scholars who have recognized the coregency between Ahaz and Hezekiah are Kenneth Kitchen in his various writings,<ref>See Kitchen's chronology in ''New Bible Dictionary'' p. 220.</ref> Leslie McFall,<ref>Leslie McFall, \"Translation Guide\" p.42.</ref> and Jack Finegan.<ref>Jack Finegan, ''Handbook of Biblical Chronology'' (rev. ed.; Peabody MA: Hendrickson, 1998) p. 246.</ref> McFall, in his 1991 article, argues that if 729 BC (that is, the Judean regnal year beginning in Tishri of 729) is taken as the start of the Ahaz/Hezekiah coregency, and 716/715 BC as the date of the death of Ahaz, then all the extensive chronological data for Hezekiah and his contemporaries in the late eighth century BC are in harmony. Further, McFall found that no [[Conjecture (textual criticism)|textual emendation]]s are required among the numerous dates, reign lengths, and synchronisms given in the [[Hebrew Bible|Hebrew Testament]] for this period.<ref>Leslie McFall, \"Translation Guide\" pp. 4\u201345 ([https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.btinternet.com/~lmf12/TransGuide.pdf&date=2010-07-19+09:25:20 Link]).</ref> In contrast, those who do not accept the Ancient Near Eastern principle of coregencies require multiple emendations of the Scriptural text, and there is no general agreement on which texts should be emended, nor is there any consensus among these scholars on the resultant chronology for the eighth century BC. This is in contrast with the general consensus among those who accept the Biblical and near Eastern practice of coregencies that Hezekiah was installed as coregent with his father Ahaz in 729 BC, and the synchronisms of 2 Kings 18 must be measured from that date, whereas the synchronisms to Sennacherib are measured from the sole reign starting in 716/715 BC. The two synchronisms to [[Hoshea]] of Israel in 2 Kings 18 are then in exact agreement with the dates of Hoshea's reign that can be determined from Assyrian sources, as is the date of Samaria's fall as stated in 2 Kings 18:10. An analogous situation of two ways of measurement, both equally valid,  is encountered in the dates given for [[Jehoram of Israel]], whose first year is synchronized to the 18th year of the sole reign of [[Jehoshaphat]] of Judah in 2 Kings 3:1 (853/852 BC), but his reign is also reckoned according to another method as starting in the second year of the coregency of Jehoshaphat and his son [[Jehoram of Judah]] (2 Kings 1:17); both methods refer to the same calendrical year.\n\nScholars who accept the principle of coregencies note that abundant evidence for their use is found in the biblical material itself.<ref>Thiele, ''Mysterious Numbers'' chapter 3, \"Coregencies and Rival Reigns.\"</ref> The agreement of scholarship built on these principles with both biblical and secular texts was such that the Thiele/McFall chronology was accepted as the best chronology for the kingdom period in Jack Finegan's encyclopedic ''Handbook of Biblical Chronology''.<ref>Jack Finegan, ''Handbook of Biblical Chronology'' p. 246.</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Resources==\n* {{cite book | last = Grena | first =  G.M. | year = 2004 | title = LMLK\u2014A Mystery Belonging to the King vol. 1 | location= Redondo Beach, California | publisher=4000 Years of Writing History | isbn = 0-9748786-0-X }}\n* {{cite book | last = Austin | first = Lynn | title = Gods And Kings | isbn = 0-7642-2989-3 }} a fictionalized account of Hezekiah's rise to power, Book 1 in Austin's \"Chronicles of the Kings\" series\n\n== External links ==\n{{commonscat}}\n*[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/264743/Hezekiah \"Hezekiah.\"] Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica.

In cases of moderate haemophilia symptoms are variable which manifest along a spectrum between severe and mild forms.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nIn both haemophilia A and B, there is spontaneous bleeding but a normal bleeding time, normal [[prothrombin time]], normal [[thrombin time]], but prolonged [[partial thromboplastin time]]. [[Internal bleeding]] is common in people with severe haemophilia and some individuals with moderate haemophilia. The most characteristic type of internal bleed is a [[hemarthrosis|joint bleed]] where blood enters into the [[joint|joint spaces]].<ref name=emed/> This is most common with severe haemophiliacs and can occur spontaneously (without evident trauma). If not treated promptly, joint bleeds can lead to permanent joint damage and disfigurement.<ref name=emed/> Bleeding into soft tissues such as [[muscle]]s and [[subcutaneous tissue]]s is less severe but can lead to damage and requires treatment.\n\nChildren with mild to moderate haemophilia may not have any signs or symptoms at birth especially if they do not undergo [[circumcision]]. Their first symptoms are often frequent and large [[bruise]]s and [[hematoma|haematoma]]s from frequent bumps and falls as they learn to walk. Swelling and bruising from bleeding in the joints, [[soft tissue]], and muscles may also occur. Children with mild haemophilia may not have noticeable symptoms for many years. Often, the first sign in very mild haemophiliacs is heavy bleeding from a [[dentistry|dental procedure]], an accident, or [[surgery]]. Females who are carriers usually have enough clotting factors from their one normal gene to prevent serious bleeding problems, though some may present as mild haemophiliacs.\n\n===Complications===\nSevere complications are much more common in cases of severe and moderate haemophilia.

Since the mutations causing the disease are [[X-linked recessive inheritance|X-linked recessive]], a female carrying the defect on one of her X-chromosomes may not be affected by it, as the equivalent [[allele]] on her other chromosome should express itself to produce the necessary clotting factors, due to X inactivation. However, the Y-chromosome in the male has no gene for factors VIII or IX. If the genes responsible for production of factor VIII or factor IX present on a male's X-chromosome are deficient there is no equivalent on the Y-chromosome to cancel it out, so the deficient gene is not masked and the disorder will develop.\n\nSince a male receives his single X-chromosome from his mother, the son of a healthy female silently carrying the deficient gene will have a 50% chance of inheriting that gene from her and with it the disease; and if his mother is affected with haemophilia, he will have a 100% chance of being a haemophiliac. In contrast, for a female to inherit the disease, she must receive two deficient X-chromosomes, one from her mother and the other from her father (who must therefore be a haemophiliac himself). Hence, haemophilia is expressed far more commonly among males than females, while double-X females are far more likely to be silent carriers, survive childhood and to submit each of her genetic children to an at least 50% risk of receiving the deficient gene. However, it is possible for female carriers to become mild haemophiliacs due to [[lyonisation]] (inactivation) of the X-chromosomes. Haemophiliac daughters are more common than they once were, as improved treatments for the disease have allowed more haemophiliac males to survive to adulthood and become parents. Adult females may experience [[menorrhagia]] (heavy periods) due to the bleeding tendency. The pattern of inheritance is criss-cross type. This type of pattern is also seen in [[colour blindness]].\n\nA mother who is a [[Genetic carrier|carrier]] has a 50% chance of passing the faulty X-chromosome to her daughter, while an affected father will always pass on the affected gene to his daughters. A son cannot inherit the defective gene from his father. This is a recessive trait and can be passed on if cases are more severe with carrier. [[Genetic testing]] and [[genetic counselling]] is recommended for families with haemophilia. [[Prenatal testing]], such as [[amniocentesis]], is available to pregnant women who may be carriers of the condition.\n\nAs with all genetic disorders, it is of course also possible for a human to acquire it spontaneously through [[mutation]], rather than inheriting it, because of a new mutation in one of their parents' gametes. Spontaneous mutations account for about 33% of all cases of haemophilia A. About 30% of cases of haemophilia B are the result of a spontaneous gene mutation.\n\nIf a female gives birth to a haemophiliac son, either the female is a carrier for the blood disorder or the haemophilia was the result of a spontaneous mutation. Until modern direct [[Genetic fingerprinting|DNA testing]], however, it was impossible to determine if a female with only healthy children was a carrier or not. Generally, the more healthy sons she bore, the higher the probability that she was not a carrier.\n\nIf a male is afflicted with the disease and has children with a female who is not a carrier, his daughters will be carriers of haemophilia. His sons, however, will not be affected with the disease. The disease is X-linked and the father cannot pass haemophilia through the Y-chromosome. Males with the disorder are then no more likely to pass on the gene to their children than carrier females, though all daughters they sire will be carriers and all sons they father will not have haemophilia (unless the mother is a carrier).\n\n===Severity===\nThere are numerous different mutations which cause each type of haemophilia. Due to differences in changes to the genes involved, people with haemophilia often have some level of active clotting factor.

Several options are available to parents. If there is no family history of haemophilia, it is usually only diagnosed when a child begins to walk or crawl. They may experience joint bleeds or easy bruising.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Haemophilia/Pages/Diagnosis.aspx|title=Haemophilia - Diagnosis - NHS Choices|last=Choices|first=NHS|website=www.nhs.uk|access-date=2017-01-01|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170101162311/http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Haemophilia/Pages/Diagnosis.aspx|archivedate=2017-01-01|df=}}</ref>\n\nMild haemophilia may only be discovered later, usually after an injury or a dental or surgical procedure.\n\n=== Before pregnancy ===\nGenetic testing and counselling are available to help determine the risk of passing the condition onto a child.<ref name=\":0\" /> This may involve testing a sample of tissue or blood to look for signs of the genetic mutation that causes haemophilia.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== During pregnancy ===\nA pregnant woman with a history of haemophilia in her family can test for the haemophilia gene.

Factor replacement can be either isolated from human [[blood serum]], [[recombinant DNA|recombinant]], or a combination of the two. Some people develop [[antibodies]] (inhibitors) against the replacement factors given to them, so the amount of the factor has to be increased or non-human replacement products must be given, such as [[porcine]] factor VIII.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nIf a person becomes refractory to replacement coagulation factor as a result of high levels of circulating inhibitors, this may be partially overcome with recombinant human [[factor VII]].\n\nIn early 2008, the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approved anti-haemophilic factor, genetically engineered from the genes of Chinese hamster ovary cells. Since 1993 recombinant factor products (which are typically cultured in Chinese hamster ovary ([[Chinese Hamster Ovary cell|CHO]]) tissue culture cells and involve little, if any [[human plasma]] products) have been available and have been widely used in wealthier western countries. While recombinant clotting factor products offer higher purity and safety, they are, like concentrate, extremely expensive, and not generally available in the developing world. In many cases, factor products of any sort are difficult to obtain in developing countries.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nClotting factors are either given preventively or on-demand. Preventive use involves the infusion of clotting factor on a regular schedule in order to keep clotting levels sufficiently high to prevent spontaneous bleeding episodes. On-demand (or episodic) treatment involves treating bleeding episodes once they arise. In 2007, a trial comparing on-demand treatment of boys (< 30 months) with haemophilia A with [[preventive healthcare|prophylactic treatment]] (infusions of 25 IU/kg body weight of Factor VIII every other day) in respect to its effect on the prevention of joint-diseases.

In contrast, cellulose contains only anhydrous glucose. For instance, besides glucose, sugar monomers in hemicellulose can include [[xylose]], [[mannose]], [[galactose]], [[rhamnose]], and [[arabinose]]. Hemicelluloses contain most of the D-[[pentose]] sugars, and occasionally small amounts of L-sugars as well.  [[Xylose]] is in most cases the sugar monomer present in the largest amount, although in softwoods mannose can be the most abundant sugar. Not only regular sugars can be found in hemicellulose, but also their acidified form, for instance [[glucuronic acid]] and [[galacturonic acid]] can be present. Hemicellulose is often associated with cellulose, but it has different composition.\n\n==Structural comparison to cellulose==\nUnlike cellulose, hemicellulose (also a polysaccharide) consists of shorter chains \u2013 500\u20133,000 sugar units as opposed to 7,000\u201315,000 glucose molecules per polymer, as seen in cellulose.<ref name=\"pmid22874093\">{{cite journal | author=Gibson LJ | title=The hierarchical structure and mechanics of plant materials | journal= [[Journal of the Royal Society Interface]] | volume=9 | issue=76 | year=2013 | pages=2749\u20132766 | url=http://rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/9/76/2749.long | pmc=3479918 | pmid=22874093 | doi=10.1098/rsif.2012.0341}}</ref> In addition, hemicellulose is a branched [[polymer]], while cellulose is unbranched.\n\n==Native structure==\n[[File:Plant cell wall diagram-en.svg|thumb|Section of a cell wall; hemicellulose in green]]\nHemicelluloses are embedded in the cell walls of plants, sometimes in chains that form a '[[Matrix (biology)|ground]]' \u2013 they bind with [[pectin]] to cellulose to form a network of cross-linked fibres.\n\n== Biosynthesis ==\nHemicelluloses are synthesised from sugar nucleotides in the cell's [[Golgi apparatus]]. Two models explain their synthesis: 1) a '2 component model' where modification occurs at two transmembrane proteins, and 2) a '1 component model' where modification occurs only at one transmembrane protein. After synthesis, hemicelluloses are transported to the plasma membrane via Golgi vesicles.\n\n==Applications==\nAs percent content of hemicellulose increases in animal feed, the voluntary feed intake decreases.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nHemicellulose is represented by the difference between [[neutral detergent fiber]] (NDF) and acid detergent fiber (ADF).\n\n==Functions==\n[[Microfibrils]] are cross-linked together by hemicellulose [[homopolymer]]s.

Scholars argue this duality is reflective of the split ethnic identities in white America.<ref name=\"Harkins\"/>\n\n==Etymology and history==\nThe [[Appalachian Mountains]] were settled in the 18th century by settlers primarily from the Province of [[Ulster]] in [[Ireland]]. The settlers from Ulster were mainly [[Protestantism|Protestants]] who migrated to Ireland, during the [[Plantation of Ulster]] in the 17th century, from [[Scotland]] and [[Northern England]]. Many further migrated to the American colonies beginning in the 1730s, and in America became known as the [[Scots-Irish American|Scots-Irish]].<ref name=\"Montgomery 2006 82\">{{cite book |first=Michael |last=Montgomery |title=From Ulster to America: The Scotch-Irish Heritage of American Engliscom/books?id=I957OegamHMC|page=82}}</ref> \n\nScholars argue that the term \"hillbilly\" originated from Scottish dialect. The term \"hill-folk\" referred to people who preferred isolation from the greater society, and \"billy\" meant \"comrade\" or \"companion\". It is suggested that \"hill-folk\" and \"billie\" were combined when the [[Cameronian]]s fled to the [[Scottish Highlands]].<ref name=\"Hillbilly Music: Source and Symbol\">{{cite journal |last1=Green |first1=Archie |title=Hillbilly Music: Source and Symbol|journal=Journal of American Folklore |date=1965 |volume=78 |issue=309 |pages=204\u2013228 |doi=10.2307/538356<!--|accessdate=1 August 2014-->}}</ref>\n\nOthers have suggested the term originated in 17th century Ireland, during the [[Williamite War in Ireland|Williamite War]], when Protestant supporters of [[William III of England|King William III]] (\"King Billy\") were often referred to as \"Billy's Boys\".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/legacies/immig_emig/northern_ireland/ni_2/article_2.shtml |title=Hillbillies in the White House |work=[[BBC News]]}}</ref> However, some scholars disagree with this theory. Michael Montgomery's ''From Ulster to America: The Scotch-Irish Heritage of American English'' states, \"In Ulster in recent years it has sometimes been supposed that it was coined to refer to followers of King William III and brought to America by early Ulster emigrants, but this derivation is almost certainly incorrect. ... In America ''hillbilly'' was first attested only in 1898, which suggests a later, independent development.\"<ref name=\"Montgomery 2006 82\"/>\n\nThe term \"hillbilly\" spread in the years following the [[American Civil War]]. At this time, the country was developing both technologically and socially, but the Appalachian region was falling behind. Before the war, Appalachia was not distinctively different from other rural areas of the country. Post-war, although the [[frontier]] pushed farther west, the region maintained frontier characteristics. Appalachians themselves were perceived as backward, quick to violence and inbred in their isolation. Fueled by news stories of mountain feuds such as that in the 1880s between the [[Hatfield\u2013McCoy feud|Hatfields and McCoys]], the hillbilly stereotype developed in the late 19th to early 20th century.<ref name=\"Harkins\" />\n\nThe \"classic\" hillbilly stereotype reached its current characterization during the years of the [[Great Depression]], when many mountaineers left their homes to find work in other areas of the country. The period of Appalachian out-migration, roughly from the 1930s through the 1950s, saw many mountain residents moving North to the Midwestern industrial cities of [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]], [[Akron, Ohio|Akron]], and [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]]. \n\nThis movement North, which became known as the \"[[Hillbilly Highway]]\", brought these previously isolated communities into mainstream United States culture. In response, poor white mountaineers became central characters in newspapers, pamphlets, and eventually, motion pictures. Authors at the time were inspired by historical figures such as [[Davy Crockett]] and [[Daniel Boone]]. The mountaineer image transferred over to the 20th century where the \"hillbilly\" stereotype emerged.<ref name=\"Harkins\" />\n\n==In popular culture==\nPop culture has perpetuated the \"hillbilly\" stereotype. Scholarly works suggest that the media has exploited both the Appalachian region and people by classifying them as \"hillbillies\". These generalizations do not match the cultural experiences of Appalachians. Appalachians, like many other groups, do not subscribe to a single identity.<ref name=Billings>{{cite book|last1=Billings|first1=Dwight B.|last2=Norman|first2=Gurney|last3=Ledford|first3=Katherine|title=Back Talk from Appalachia: Confronting Stereotypes |date=2000 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kx8FNbtA7CQC&pg=PR4&dq=Back+Talk+from+Appalachia+Confronting+Stereotypes&hl=en&sa=X&ei=7SrWU-_eCKzy7Abt-4DgCg&ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Back%20Talk%20from%20Appalachia%20Confronting%20Stereotypes&f=false|accessdate=31 July 2014}}</ref> One of the issues associated with stereotyping is that it is profitable.

Films such as ''[[Sergeant York (film)|Sergeant York]]'' or the [[Ma and Pa Kettle]] series portrayed the \"hillbilly\" as wild but good-natured. Television programs of the 1960s such as ''[[The Real McCoys]]'', ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'', and especially ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'', portrayed the \"hillbilly\" as backwards but with enough wisdom to outwit more sophisticated city folk. ''[[Gunsmoke]]''{{'s}} [[Festus Haggen]] was portrayed as intelligent and quick-witted (but lacking \"education\"). The popular 1970s television variety show ''[[Hee Haw]]'' regularly lampooned the stereotypical \"hillbilly\" lifestyle. A darker image of the hillbilly is found in the film ''[[Deliverance]]'' (1972), based on a novel by [[James Dickey]] which depicted some \"hillbillies\" as genetically deficient, [[inbreeding|inbred]], and murderous, while depicting others as helpful, friendly, and smart.\n\n\"Hillbillies\" were at the center of reality television in the 21st century. Network television shows such as ''New Beverly Hillbillies'', ''High Life'', and ''[[The Simple Life]]'' displayed the \"hillbilly\" lifestyle for viewers in the United States. This sparked protests across the country with rural-minded individuals gathering to fight the stereotype. The Center for Rural Strategies started a nationwide campaign stating the stereotype was \"politically incorrect\". The Kentucky-based organization engaged political figures in the movement such as [[Robert Byrd]] and [[Mike Huckabee]]. Both protestors argued that the discrimination of any other group in United States would not be tolerated, so neither should the discrimination against rural U.S. citizens. A 2003 piece published by ''[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]]'' read, \"In this day of hypersensitivity to diversity and political correctness, Appalachians have been a group that it is still socially acceptable to demean and joke about. ... But rural folks have spoken up and said 'enough' to the Hollywood mockers.\"<ref name=Pate>{{cite book |last1=Pate|first1=Susan|title=Grappling With Diversity Readings On Civil Rights Pedagogy and Critical Multiculturalism |date=2008 |publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=vE1chnGUbrMC&oi=fnd&pg=PA205&dq=%22hillbilly+stereotype%22&ots=O0z3RMRrYc&sig=o53GXRD2aO4Q2LkDcRlzD1sigmU#v=onepage&q=%22hillbilly%20stereotype%22&f=false}}</ref>\n\n''[[Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis]]'' (2016) is a memoir by [[J.

Appalachian folk song existed long before the \"hillbilly\" label. When the commercial industry was combined with \"traditional Appalachian folksong\", \"hillbilly music\" was formed. Some argue this is a \"High Culture\" issue where sophisticated individuals may see something considered \"unsophisticated\" as \"trash\".<ref name=\"Hillbilly Music: Source and Symbol\" />\n\nIn the early-20th century, artists began to utilize the \"hillbilly\" label. The term gained momentum due to [[Ralph Peer]], the recording director of [[Okeh Records|OKeh Records]], who heard it being used among Southerners when he went down to Virginia to record the music and labeled all Southern country music as so from then on.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Pop, Rock and Soul Reader: Histories and Debates|last=Brackett|first=David|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref>  [[The York Brothers]] entitled one of their songs \"Hillbilly Rose\" and [[the Delmore Brothers]] followed with their song \"Hillbilly Boogie\". In 1927, the [[Gennett Records|Gennett]] studios in [[Richmond, Indiana]], made a recording of black fiddler Jim Booker. The recordings were labeled \"made for Hillbilly\" in the Gennett files and were marketed to a white audience. Columbia Records had much success with the \"Hill Billies\" featuring [[Al Hopkins]] and [[Charlie Bowman|Fiddlin' Charlie Bowman]].\n\nBy the late-1940s, radio stations started to use the \"hillbilly music\" label. Originally, \"hillbilly\" was used to describe fiddlers and string bands, but now it was used to describe traditional Appalachian music. Appalachians had never used this term to describe their own music. Popular songs whose style bore characteristics of both hillbilly and [[African American]] music were referred to as ''[[old-time music|hillbilly boogie]]'' and ''[[rockabilly]]''. [[Elvis Presley]] was a prominent player of rockabilly and was known early in his career as the \"Hillbilly Cat\".\n\nWhen the Country Music Association was founded in 1958, the term ''hillbilly music'' gradually fell out of use. The music industry merged hillbilly music, [[Western swing]], and [[Western music (North America)|Cowboy music]], to form the current category C&W, [[Country and Western]].\n\nSome artists (notably [[Hank Williams]]) and fans were offended by the \"hillbilly music\" label. While the term is not used as frequently today, it is still used on occasion to refer to [[old-time music]] or [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]]. For example, [[WHRB]] broadcasts a popular weekly radio show entitled \"Hillbilly at Harvard\". The show is devoted to playing a mix of [[old-time music]], [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]], and traditional [[country music|country and western]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Potier |first=Beth |title='Hillbilly at Harvard' hosts heady hoedown weekly |url=http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2002/01.10/14-hillbilly.html |work=Harvard University Gazette |publisher=Harvard University |accessdate=19 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716181047/http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2002/01.10/14-hillbilly.html |archivedate=16 July 2012 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==Cultural implications==\nThe hillbilly stereotype is considered to have had a traumatizing effect on some in the Appalachian region. Feelings of shame, self-hatred, and detachment are cited as a result of \"culturally transmitted traumatic stress syndrome\". Appalachian scholars say that the large-scale stereotyping has rewritten Appalachian history, making Appalachians feel particularly vulnerable. \"Hillbilly\" has now become part of Appalachian identity and some Appalachians feel they are constantly defending themselves against this image.<ref name=Billings />\n\nThe stereotyping also has political implications for the region. There is a sense of \"perceived history\" that prevents many political issues from receiving adequate attention. Appalachians are often blamed for economic struggles. \"Moonshiners, welfare cheats, and coal miners\" are stereotypes stemming from the greater hillbilly stereotype in the region. This [[prejudice]] has been said to serve as a barrier for addressing some serious issues such as the economy and the environment.<ref name=Billings />\n\nDespite the political and social difficulties associated with stereotyping, Appalachians have organized to enact change. The [[War on Poverty]] is sometimes considered to be an example of one effort that allowed for Appalachian community organization. [[Grassroots]] movements, protests, and strikes are common in the area, though not always successful.<ref name=Billings />\n\n==Intragroup versus intergroup usage==\nThe [[Springfield, Missouri]] Chamber of Commerce once presented dignitaries visiting the city with an \"Ozark Hillbilly Medallion\" and a certificate proclaiming the honoree a \"hillbilly of the Ozarks\". On June 7, 1952, President [[Harry S. Truman]] received the medallion after a breakfast speech<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.trumanlibrary.org/publicpapers/index.php?pid=2414&st=&st1= |title=Remarks at a Breakfast of the 35th Division Association, Springfield, Missouri |date=June 7, 1952 |accessdate=30 October 2010}}</ref> at the Shrine Mosque for the [[35th Infantry Division (United States)|35th Division]] Association.

The event began by local Shriners as a fundraiser to support the Shriners Children's Hospital. It has grown since its beginning in 1976 and now is the second largest festival held in the state of Kentucky. Artists and craftspeople showcase their talents and sell their works on display. Nationally renowned musicians as well as the best of the regional mountain musicians share six different stages located throughout the downtown area of Pikeville. Aspiring hillbillies from across the nation compete to come up with the wildest Hillbilly outfit. The event has earned its name as the Mardi Gras of the Mountains. Fans of \"mountain music\" come from around the United States to hear this annual concentrated gathering of talent. Some refer to this event as the equivalent of a \"Woodstock\" for mountain music.\n\nThe term \"Hillbilly\" is used with pride by a number of people within the region as well as famous persons, such as singer [[Dolly Parton]], chef [[Sean Brock]], and actress [[Minnie Pearl]]. Positive self-identification with the term generally includes identification with a set of \"hillbilly values\" including love and respect for nature, strong work ethic, generosity toward neighbors and those in need, family ties, self-reliance, resiliency, and a simple lifestyle.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Appalachian stereotypes]]\n* [[Country (identity)]]\n* [[Cracker (pejorative)]]\n* [[Hillbilly armor]]\n* [[List of ethnic slurs]]\n* [[Redneck]]\n* [[Trailer trash]]\n* [[Yokel]]\n* [[Zomia (geography)]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Ethnic slurs}}\n\n[[Category:American folklore]]\n[[Category:American people of Scotch-Irish descent]]\n[[Category:American regional nicknames]]\n[[Category:Appalachian culture]]\n[[Category:Appalachian people]]\n[[Category:Appalachian society]]\n[[Category:Appalachian studies]]\n[[Category:European-American culture in Appalachia]]\n[[Category:Ozarks]]\n[[Category:Pejorative terms for people]]\n[[Category:Scotch-Irish American history]]\n[[Category:Stereotypes of rural people]]\n[[Category:Stereotypes of white Americans]]", "sha1": "b6xz82f40qyh66b3kfq518p2jdc0vlh"}}, {"title": "Host", "ns": "0", "id": "14012", "revision": {"id": "857737055", "parentid": "857736646", "timestamp": "2018-09-02T18:01:29Z", "contributor": {"username": "Bkonrad", "id": "44062"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Reverted edits by [[Special:Contribs/184.22.45.153|184.22.45.153]] ([[User talk:184.22.45.153|talk]]) to last version by Johnuniq", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "<!---------------------------------------------------------------------->\n<!--     From MoS:DAB: use ONE LINK per entry, SHORT descriptions.    -->\n<!--    AVOID: piping links, external links, redlinks with little     -->\n<!--            potential, full sentences, and references             -->\n<!---------------------------------------------------------------------->\n{{Wiktionary|host|h\u00f6st|h\u00f8st|hos\u0165}}\n'''Host''' (masculine) and '''hostess''' (feminine) most often refer to a person responsible for guests at an event or providing [[hospitality]] during it.\n\n'''Host''' may also refer to:\n{{TOC right}}\n== Places==\n*[[Host, Pennsylvania]], a village in Berks County\n\n==People==\n*[[Jim Host]] (born 1937), American businessman\n*[[Michel Host]] (born 1942), French writer\n*\"Host\", an author abbreviation in botany for [[Nicolaus Thomas Host]]\n\n==Arts, entertainment, and media==\n===Fictional entities===\n* [[Armies and hosts of Middle-earth warfare]], fictional entities in J.R.R.

Cort\u00e9s was part of the generation of Spanish colonizers who began the first phase of the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]].\n\nBorn in [[Medell\u00edn, Spain]], to a family of lesser [[nobility]], Cort\u00e9s chose to pursue adventure and riches in the [[New World]]. He went to [[Hispaniola]] and later to [[Cuba]], where he received an ''[[encomienda]]'' (the right to the labor of certain subjects). For a short time, he served as ''[[alcalde]]'' (magistrate) of the second Spanish town founded on the island. In 1519, he was elected captain of the third expedition to the mainland, an expedition which he partly funded. His enmity with the Governor of Cuba, [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez de Cu\u00e9llar]], resulted in the recall of the expedition at the last moment, an order which Cort\u00e9s ignored.\n\nArriving on the continent, Cort\u00e9s executed a successful strategy of allying with some [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous people]] against others. He also used a native woman, [[La Malinche|Do\u00f1a Marina]], as an [[interpreter]]. She later bore his first son. When the Governor of Cuba sent emissaries to arrest Cort\u00e9s, he fought them and won, using the extra troops as reinforcements. Cort\u00e9s wrote letters directly to the king asking to be acknowledged for his successes instead of being punished for mutiny. After he overthrew the [[Aztec Empire]], Cort\u00e9s was awarded the title of ''Marqu\u00e9s del Valle de [[Oaxaca]]'', while the more prestigious title of [[New Spain|Viceroy]] was given to a high-ranking nobleman, [[Antonio de Mendoza]]. In 1541 Cort\u00e9s returned to Spain, where he died six years later of natural causes but embittered.\n\nBecause of the controversial undertakings of Cort\u00e9s and the scarcity of reliable sources of information about him, it is difficult to describe his personality or motivations. Early lionizing of the conquistadors did not encourage deep examination of Cort\u00e9s. Later reconsideration of the conquistadors in the context of modern anti-colonial sentiment has done little to enlarge understanding of Cort\u00e9s. As a result of these historical trends, descriptions of Cort\u00e9s tend to be simplistic, and either damning or idealizing.\n\n==Name==\n{{Spanish colonization of the Americas}}\n{{See also|Spanish naming customs}}\n\nCort\u00e9s himself used the form \"Hernando\" or \"Fernando\" for his given name, as seen in his signature and the title of an early portrait.<ref>See information box for his signature and painting.</ref> [[William Hickling Prescott]]'s ''Conquest of Mexico'' (1843) also refers to him as Hernando Cort\u00e9s.  At some point writers began using the shortened form of \"Hern\u00e1n\" more generally.\n\n==Early life==\nCort\u00e9s was born in 1485 in the town of [[Medell\u00edn (Spain)|Medell\u00edn]], in modern-day [[Extremadura]], [[Spain]]. His father, Mart\u00edn Cort\u00e9s de Monroy, born in 1449 to Rodrigo or Ruy Fern\u00e1ndez de Monroy and his wife Mar\u00eda Cort\u00e9s, was an [[infantry]] [[Captain (OF-2)|captain]] of distinguished ancestry but slender means. Hern\u00e1n's mother was Catal\u00edna Pizarro Altamirano.<ref name=\"Machado, J. T 1970\">Machado, J. T. Montalv\u00e3o, ''Dos Pizarros de Espanha aos de Portugal e Brasil'', Author's Edition, 1st Edition, Lisbon, 1970.</ref>\n\nThrough his mother, Hern\u00e1n was second cousin once removed of [[Francisco Pizarro]], who later conquered the [[Inca Empire]] of modern-day [[Peru]], and not to be confused with another Francisco Pizarro, who joined Cort\u00e9s to conquer the [[Aztec]]s. (His mother's father, Diego Altamirano, was cousin to Leonor S\u00e1nchez Pizarro Altamirano, first cousin of Pizarro's father.)<ref name=\"Machado, J. T 1970\"/> Through his father, Hern\u00e1n was related to [[Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando]], the third [[Governor of Hispaniola]]. His paternal great-grandfather was [[Rodrigo de Monroy y Almaraz, 5th Lord of Monroy]].\n\nAccording to his [[biographer]], [[chaplain]], and friend [[Francisco L\u00f3pez de G\u00f3mara]], Cort\u00e9s was pale and sickly as a child. At the age of 14, he was sent to study Latin under an uncle in Salamanca. Modern historians have misconstrued this personal tutoring as time enrolled at the University of Salamanca.<ref>David A. Boruchoff, \"Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s,\" ''International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences'', 2nd. ed. (2008), vol. 2, pp. 146\u201349 [http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Hernan_Cortes.aspx Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]</ref>\n\nAfter two years, Cort\u00e9s returned home to Medell\u00edn, much to the irritation of his parents, who had hoped to see him equipped for a profitable legal career. However, those two years at [[Salamanca]], plus his long period of training and experience as a notary, first in Valladolid and later in [[Hispaniola]], gave him knowledge of the legal codes of Castile that he applied to help justify his unauthorized conquest of Mexico.<ref>Boruchoff, \"Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s,\" [http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Hernan_Cortes.aspx Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s], ''Encyclopedia</ref>\n\nAt this point in his life, Cort\u00e9s was described by G\u00f3mara as ruthless, haughty, and mischievous.<ref name=\"Hernan Cort\u00e9s\">[http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/imperialism/notes/cortez.html Francisco L\u00f3pez de G\u00f3mara, \"Hernan Cort\u00e9s\"], The Latin Library</ref> The 16-year-old youth had returned home to feel constrained life in his small provincial town. By this time, news of the exciting discoveries of [[Christopher Columbus]] in the New World was streaming back to Spain.\n\n==Early career in the New World==\nPlans were made for Cort\u00e9s to sail to the Americas with a family acquaintance and distant relative, Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando, the newly appointed [[Governor of Hispaniola]]. (This island is now divided between [[Haiti]] and the [[Dominican Republic]]). Cort\u00e9s suffered an injury and was prevented from traveling. He spent the next year wandering the country, probably spending most of his time in Spain's southern ports of [[Cadiz]], [[Palos de la Frontera|Palos]], [[Sanl\u00facar de Barrameda|Sanlucar]], and [[Seville]]. He finally left for Hispaniola in 1504 and became a colonist.<ref>Crow, John A. ''The Epic of Latin America''. Los Angeles, California: University of California Press, 1992. 4th ed. p. 73</ref>\n\n===Arrival===\nCort\u00e9s reached Hispaniola in a ship commanded by Alonso Quintero, who tried to deceive his superiors and reach the New World before them in order to secure personal advantages. Quintero's mutinous conduct may have served as a model for Cort\u00e9s in his subsequent career. The history of the conquistadores is rife with accounts of rivalry, jockeying for positions, mutiny, and betrayal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://coloquio.com/famosos/cortes.htm |title=Famous Hispanics: Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s |publisher=Coloquio.com |date= |accessdate=2009-07-23}}</ref>\n\nUpon his arrival in 1504 in [[Santo Domingo]], the capital of Hispaniola, the 18-year-old Cort\u00e9s registered as a citizen; this entitled him to a building plot and land to farm. Soon afterward, Governor Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando granted him an ''[[encomienda]]'' and appointed him as a notary of the town of [[Azua de Compostela]]. His next five years seemed to help establish him in the colony; in 1506, Cort\u00e9s took part in the conquest of Hispaniola and Cuba. The expedition leader awarded him a large estate of land and Indian slaves for his efforts.\n\n===Cuba (1511\u20131519)===\nIn 1511, Cort\u00e9s  accompanied [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez de Cu\u00e9llar]], an aide of the Governor of Hispaniola, in his expedition to conquer Cuba. Vel\u00e1zquez was appointed [[Governor of New Spain]]. At the age of 26, Cort\u00e9s was made clerk to the treasurer with the responsibility of ensuring that the Crown received the ''quinto'', or customary one fifth of the profits from the expedition.\n\nVel\u00e1zquez was so impressed with Cort\u00e9s that he secured a high political position for him in the colony. He became secretary for Governor Vel\u00e1zquez. Cort\u00e9s was twice appointed municipal magistrate (''[[alcalde]]'') of [[Santiago de Cuba|Santiago]]. In Cuba, Cort\u00e9s became a man of substance with an ''[[encomienda]]'' to provide Indian labor for his mines and cattle. This new position of power also made him the new source of leadership, which opposing forces in the colony could then turn to. In 1514, Cort\u00e9s led a group which demanded that more Indians be assigned to the settlers.\n\nAs time went on, relations between Cort\u00e9s and Governor Vel\u00e1zquez became strained.<ref name=Hassig94>Hassig, Ross. ''Mexico and the Spanish Conquest''. Longman Group UK Limited, 1994, pp. 45\u201346</ref> This began once news reached Vel\u00e1zquez that [[Juan de Grijalva]] had established a colony on the mainland where there was a bonanza of silver and gold, and Vel\u00e1zquez decided to send him help. Cort\u00e9s was appointed [[Captain-General]] of this new expedition in October 1518, but was advised to move fast before Vel\u00e1zquez changed his mind.<ref name=Hassig94/>\n\nWith Cort\u00e9s' experience as an administrator, knowledge gained from many failed expeditions, and his impeccable rhetoric he was able to gather six ships and 300 men, within a month. Vel\u00e1zquez's jealousy exploded and he decided to put the expedition in other hands. However, Cort\u00e9s quickly gathered more men and ships in other Cuban ports.\n\nCort\u00e9s also found time to become romantically involved with Catalina Xu\u00e1rez (or Ju\u00e1rez), the sister-in-law of Governor Vel\u00e1zquez. Part of Vel\u00e1zquez's displeasure seems to have been based on a belief that Cort\u00e9s was trifling with Catalina's affections. Cort\u00e9s was temporarily distracted by one of Catalina's sisters but finally married Catalina, reluctantly, under pressure from Governor Vel\u00e1zquez. However, by doing so, he hoped to secure the good will of both her family and that of Vel\u00e1zquez.<ref>Sanderson Beck, [http://www.san.beck.org/11-2-SpanishConquest.html#3 \"Cort\u00e8s in Mexico\"]</ref>\n\nIt was not until he had been almost 15 years in the Indies that Cort\u00e9s began to look beyond his substantial status as mayor of the capital of Cuba and as a man of affairs in the thriving colony. He missed the first two expeditions, under the orders of [[Francisco Hern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba (discoverer of Yucat\u00e1n)|Francisco Hern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba]] and then [[Juan de Grijalva]], sent by Diego Vel\u00e1zquez to [[Mexico]] in 1518.\n\n==Conquest of Mexico (1519\u20131521)==\n{{Main|Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire}}\n\n[[Image:Ruta de Cort\u00e9s.svg|thumb|300px|A map depicting Cort\u00e9s's invasion route from the coast to the Aztec capital of [[Tenochtitlan]].]]\nIn 1518, Vel\u00e1zquez put Cort\u00e9s in command of an expedition to explore and secure the interior of Mexico for colonization. At the last minute, due to the old argument between the two, Vel\u00e1zquez changed his mind and revoked Cort\u00e9s's charter. He ignored the orders and, in an act of open [[mutiny]], went anyway in February 1519. He stopped in [[Trinidad, Cuba]], to hire more soldiers and obtain more horses.

Catalina lacked the noble title of ''do\u00f1a,'' so at this point his marriage with her no longer raised his status. Their marriage had been childless. Since Cort\u00e9s had sired children with a variety of indigenous women, including a son around 1522 by his cultural translator, [[La Malinche|Do\u00f1a Marina]], Cort\u00e9s knew he was capable of fathering children. Cort\u00e9s's only male heir at this point was illegitimate, but nonetheless named after Cort\u00e9s's father, Mart\u00edn Cort\u00e9s. This son [[Mart\u00edn Cort\u00e9s (son of Malinche)|Mart\u00edn Cort\u00e9s]] was sometimes called \"El Mestizo\".\n\nCatalina Su\u00e1rez died under mysterious circumstances the night of November 1\u20132, 1522.

In 1529 he had been accorded the noble designation of ''[[Don (honorific)|don]]'', but more importantly was given the noble title of Marquis of the Valley of Oaxaca and married the Spanish noblewoman Do\u00f1a Juana de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga.

During the [[Age of Discovery]], the [[Catholic Church and the Age of Discovery|Catholic Church]] had seen early attempts at conversion in the Caribbean islands by Spanish friars, particularly the mendicant orders. Cort\u00e9s made a request to the Spanish monarch to send [[Franciscan]] and [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] friars to Mexico to convert the vast indigenous populations to Christianity. In his fourth letter to the king, Cort\u00e9s pleaded for friars rather than diocesan or secular priests because those clerics were in his view a serious danger to the Indians' conversion.\n\n<blockquote>If these people [Indians] were now to see the affairs of the Church and the service of God in the hands of canons or other dignitaries, and saw them indulge in the vices and profanities now common in Spain, knowing that such men were the ministers of God, it would bring our Faith into much harm that I believe any further preaching would be of no avail.<ref>Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s, ''Letters from Mexico'', translated and edited by A.R. Pagden. New York: Grossman Publishers, 1971, p. 333.</ref></blockquote>\n\nHe wished the mendicants to be the main evangelists.  Mendicant friars did not usually have full priestly powers to perform all the sacraments needed for conversion of the Indians and growth of the neophytes in the Christian faith, so Cort\u00e9s laid out a solution to this to the king.\n\n<blockquote>Your Majesty should likewise beseech His Holiness [the pope] to grant these powers to the two principal persons in the religious orders that are to come here, and that they should be his delegates, one from the Order of St. Francis and the other from the Order of St. Dominic. They should bring the most extensive powers Your Majesty is able to obtain, for, because these lands are so far from the Church of Rome, and we, the Christians who now reside here and shall do so in the future, are so far from the proper remedies of our consciences and, as we are human, so subject to sin, it is essential that His Holiness should be generous with us and grant to these persons most extensive powers, to be handed down to persons actually in residence here whether it be given to the general of each order or to his provincials.<ref>Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s, ''Letters from Mexico'', translated and edited by A.R. Pagden. New York: Grossman Publishers, 1971, p. 334</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe Franciscans arrived in May 1524, a symbolically powerful group of twelve known as the [[Twelve Apostles of Mexico]], led by Fray [[Mart\u00edn de Valencia]].  Franciscan [[Geronimo de Mendieta]] claimed that Cort\u00e9s's most important deed was the way he met this first group of Franciscans. The conqueror himself was said to have met the friars as they approached the capital, kneeling at the feet of the friars who had walked from the coast. This story was told by Franciscans to demonstrate Cort\u00e9s piety and humility and was a powerful message to all, including the Indians, that Cort\u00e9s's earthly power was subordinate to the spiritual power of the friars. However, one of the first twelve Franciscans, Fray [[Toribio de Benavente Motolinia]] does not mention it in his history.<ref>John Leddy Phelan, ''The Millennial Kingdom of the Franciscans in the New World,'' chapter 3, \"Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s, the Moses of the New World,\" Berkeley: University of California Press, second edition, revised, 1971, pp. 33\u201334.</ref> Cort\u00e9s and the Franciscans had a particularly strong alliance in Mexico, with Franciscans seeing him as \"the new Moses\" for conquering Mexico and opening it to Christian evangelization. In Motolinia's 1555 response to Dominican [[Bartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas]], he praises Cort\u00e9s.\n\n<blockquote>And as to those who murmur against the Marqu\u00e9s del Valle [Cort\u00e9s], God rest him, and who try to blacken and obscure his deeds, I believe that before God their deeds are not as acceptable as those of the Marqu\u00e9s. Although as a human he was a sinner, he had faith and works of a good Christian, and a great desire to employ his life and property in widening and augmenting the fair of Jesus Christ, and dying for the conversion of these gentiles ... Who has loved and defended the Indians of this new world like Cort\u00e9s? ... Through this captain, God opened the door for us to preach his holy gospel and it was he who caused the Indians to revere the holy sacraments and respect the ministers of the church.<ref>Toribio de Benavente Motolinia, \"The Franciscan reply (to the Dominicans) in ''Letters and People of the Spanish Indies, Sixteenth Century,'' translated and edited by [[James Lockhart (historian)|James Lockhart]] and Enrique Otte.

Whereas Book XII of the Florentine Codex concludes with an account of Spaniards' search for gold, in Sahag\u00fan's 1585 revised account, he ends with praise of Cort\u00e9s for requesting the Franciscans be sent to Mexico to convert the Indians.<ref>Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan, ''Conquest of New Spain, 1585 Revision,'' translated by Howard F.

Fearing that [[Cuauht\u00e9moc]] might head an insurrection in Mexico, he brought him with him to Honduras. In a controversial move, Cuauht\u00e9moc was executed during the journey. Raging over Olid's treason, Cort\u00e9s issued a decree to arrest Vel\u00e1zquez, whom he was sure was behind Olid's treason.

The Licentiate then fell ill and died shortly after his arrival, appointing [[Marcos de Aguilar]] as ''alcalde mayor''. The aged Aguilar also became sick and appointed [[Alonso de Estrada]] governor, who was confirmed in his functions by a royal decree in August 1527. Cort\u00e9s, suspected of poisoning them, refrained from taking over the government.\n\nEstrada sent Diego de Figueroa to the south. De Figueroa raided graveyards and extorted contributions, meeting his end when the ship carrying these treasures sank. Albornoz persuaded Alonso de Estrada to release Salazar and Chirinos. When Cort\u00e9s complained angrily after one of his adherents' hands was cut off, Estrada ordered him exiled. Cort\u00e9s sailed for Spain in 1528 to appeal to King Charles.\n\n===First return to Spain (1528) and Marquisate of the Valley of Oaxaca===\n[[Image:Jakob Seisenegger 001.jpg|thumb|upright|''Emperor Charles V with Hound'' (1532), a painting by the 16th-century artist [[Jakob Seisenegger]].]]\nIn 1528, Cort\u00e9s returned to Spain to appeal to the justice of his master, Charles V.

Denying he had held back on gold due the crown, he showed that he had contributed more than the quinto (one-fifth) required. Indeed, he had spent lavishly to build the new capital of Mexico City on the ruins of the Aztec capital of Tenochtitl\u00e1n, leveled during the siege that brought down the Aztec empire.\n\nHe was received by Charles with every distinction, and decorated with the [[order of Santiago]]. In return for his efforts in expanding the still young [[Spanish Empire]], Cort\u00e9s was rewarded in 1529 by being accorded the noble title of ''[[Don (honorific)|don]]'' but more importantly named the ''\"Marqu\u00e9s del Valle de [[Oaxaca]]\"'' ([[Marquisate of the Valley of Oaxaca|Marquis of the Valley of Oaxaca]] and married the Spanish noblewoman Do\u00f1a Juana Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, after the 1522 death of his much less distinguished first wife, Catalina Su\u00e1rez.  The noble title and senorial estate of the Marquesado was passed down to his descendants until 1811. The Oaxaca Valley was one of the wealthiest regions of New Spain, and Cort\u00e9s had 23,000 [[vassal]]s in 23 named [[encomiendas]] in perpetuity.<ref name=Grunberg/><ref>Robert Himmerich y Valencia, ''The Encomenderos of New Spain, 1521\u20131555.

During his travel to Spain, his property was mismanaged by abusive colonial administrators. He sided with local natives in a lawsuit. The natives documented the abuses in the [[Huexotzinco Codex]].\n\nThe entailed estate and title passed to his legitimate son Don [[Mart\u00edn Cort\u00e9s, 2nd Marquis of the Valley of Oaxaca|Mart\u00edn Cort\u00e9s]] upon Cort\u00e9s's death in 1547, who became the Second Marquis. Don Mart\u00edn's association with the so-called Encomenderos' Conspiracy endangered the entailed holdings, but they were restored and remained the continuing reward for Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s's family through the generations.\n\n===Return to Mexico===\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2015}}\n[[Image:Hernan Fernando Cortes.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s Monroy, with his coat of arms on the upper left corner. Painting reproduced in the book ''America'' (R. Cronau 19th century).]]\nCort\u00e9s returned to Mexico in 1530 with new titles and honors, but with diminished power. Although Cort\u00e9s still retained military authority and permission to continue his conquests, viceroy Don [[Antonio de Mendoza]] was appointed in 1535 to administer New Spain's civil affairs. This division of power led to continual dissension, and caused the failure of several enterprises in which Cort\u00e9s was engaged.\n\nOn returning to Mexico, Cort\u00e9s found the country in a state of [[anarchy]]. There was a strong suspicion in court circles of an intended rebellion by Cort\u00e9s, and a charge was brought against him that cast a fatal blight upon his character and plans. He was accused of murdering his first wife. The proceedings of the investigation were kept secret.\n\nNo report, either exonerating or condemning Cort\u00e9s, was published. Had the Government declared him innocent, it would have greatly increased his popularity. Had it declared him a criminal, a crisis would have been precipitated by the accused and his party. Silence was the only safe policy, but that silence is suggestive that grave danger was feared from his influence.\n\nAfter reasserting his position and reestablishing some sort of order, Cort\u00e9s retired to his estates at [[Palace of Cort\u00e9s, Cuernavaca|Cuernavaca]], about 30 miles (48&nbsp;km) south of Mexico City. There he concentrated on the building of his palace and on Pacific exploration. Remaining in Mexico between 1530 and 1541, Cort\u00e9s quarreled with [[Nu\u00f1o Beltr\u00e1n de Guzm\u00e1n]] and disputed the right to explore the territory that is today [[California]] with [[Antonio de Mendoza]], the first viceroy.\n\nCortes acquired several silver mines in [[Zumpango del Rio]] in 1534.  By the early 1540s, he owned 20 silver mines in [[Sultepec]], 12 in [[Taxco]], and 3 in [[Zacualpan, State of Mexico|Zacualpan]].  Earlier, Cortes had claimed the silver in the [[Tamazula de Gordiano|Tamazula]] area.<ref name=\"Bakewell\">{{cite book|author=West, Robert.

Cort\u00e9s also spent time exploring the Pacific coast of Mexico. The [[Gulf of California]] was originally named the ''Sea of Cortes'' by its discoverer [[Francisco de Ulloa]] in 1539. This was the last major expedition by Cort\u00e9s.\n\n==Later life and death==\n\n===Second return to Spain===\nAfter his exploration of Baja California, Cort\u00e9s returned to Spain in 1541, hoping to confound his angry civilians, who had brought many lawsuits against him (for debts, abuse of power, etc.).<ref name=Grunberg/>\n\nOn his return he was utterly neglected, and could scarcely obtain an audience. On one occasion he forced his way through a crowd that surrounded the emperor's carriage, and mounted on the footstep.

In February 1544 he made a claim on the royal treasury, but was ignored for the next three years. Disgusted, he decided to return to Mexico in 1547. When he reached Seville, he was stricken with [[dysentery]]. He died in [[Castilleja de la Cuesta]], [[Seville]] province, on December 2, 1547, from a case of [[pleurisy]] at the age of 62.\n\nLike [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]], he died a wealthy but embittered man.{{clarify|post-text=See [[Talk:Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s#Narrative confusion|talk page]].|date=December 2013}} He left his many [[mestizo]] and white children well cared for in his will, along with every one of their mothers. He requested in his will that his remains eventually be buried in Mexico. Before he died he had the Pope remove the \"natural\" status of four of his children (legitimizing them in the eyes of the church), including [[Mart\u00edn Cort\u00e9s (son of do\u00f1a Marina)|Martin]], the son he had with Do\u00f1a Marina (also known as La Malinche), said to be his favourite.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} His daughter, Do\u00f1a Catalina, however, died shortly after her father's death.\n[[File:Busto de Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s.jpg|thumb|left|Bust Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s in the [[:es:Archivo General de Indias|Archivo de Indias]] in [[Seville]]]]\nAfter his death, his body was moved more than eight times for several reasons. On December 4, 1547 he was buried in the [[mausoleum]] of the Duke of Medina in the church of San Isidoro del Campo, Sevilla. Three years later (1550) due to the space being required by the duke, his body was moved to the altar of Santa Catarina in the same church. In his testament, Cort\u00e9s asked for his body to be buried in the monastery he had ordered to be built in Coyoacan in M\u00e9xico, ten years after his death, but the monastery was never built. So in 1566, his body was sent to New Spain and buried in the church of  San Francisco de Texcoco, where his mother and one of his sisters were buried.\n[[File:Tumba de Cort\u00e9s.JPG|thumb|Tomb of Cort\u00e9s in the Hospital de Jes\u00fas Nazareno, which he founded in Mexico City.]]\nIn 1629, ''Don Pedro Cort\u00e9s fourth \"Marquez del Valle'', his last male descendant, died, so the viceroy decided to move the bones of Cort\u00e9s along with those of his descendant to the Franciscan church in M\u00e9xico. This was delayed for nine years, while his body stayed in the main room of the palace of the viceroy. Eventually it was moved to the Sagrario of  Franciscan church, where it stayed for 87 years. In 1716, it was moved to another place in the same church. In 1794, his bones were moved to the \"[[Hospital de Jes\u00fas Nazareno|Hospital de Jesus]]\" (founded by Cort\u00e9s), where a statue by [[Manuel Tols\u00e1|Tols\u00e1]] and a mausoleum were made.

Another main source is the biography written by Cort\u00e9s's private chaplain [[Lopez de G\u00f3mara]], which was written in Spain several years after the conquest. G\u00f3mara never set foot in the Americas and knew only what Cort\u00e9s had told him, and he had an affinity for knightly romantic stories which he incorporated richly in the biography. The third major source is written as a reaction to what its author calls \"the lies of Gomara\", the eyewitness account written by the Conquistador [[Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo]] does not paint Cort\u00e9s as a [[romantic hero]] but rather tries to emphasize that Cort\u00e9s's men should also be remembered as important participants in the undertakings in Mexico.\n[[File:1000 pesetas, 12 de octubre de 1992, Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s.jpg|thumb|300px|1000 Spanish peseta note issued in 1992]]\nIn the years following the conquest more critical accounts of the Spanish arrival in Mexico were written. The [[Dominican friar]] [[Bartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas]] wrote his ''[[A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies]]'' which raises strong accusations of brutality and heinous violence towards the Indians; accusations against both the conquistadors in general and Cort\u00e9s in particular.<ref name=\"WDL\">{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/515/ |title = Mirror of the Cruel and Horrible Spanish Tyranny Perpetrated in the Netherlands, by the Tyrant, the Duke of Alba, and Other Commanders of King Philip II |website = [[World Digital Library]] |year = 1620 |accessdate = 2013-08-25 }}</ref> The accounts of the conquest given in the [[Florentine Codex]] by the Franciscan [[Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan]] and his native informants are also less than flattering towards Cort\u00e9s.

The plot follows his amoral and manipulative scheme to become leader of the governing party and, thus, [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]].\n\nMichael Dobbs did not envision writing the second and third books, as Urquhart dies at the end of the first novel.

[[Francis Urquhart]] ([[Ian Richardson]]), an [[Member of Parliament|MP]] and the Government [[Chief Whip]] in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], introduces viewers to the contestants, from which [[List of House of Cards trilogy characters#Henry Collingridge, MP|Henry \"Hal\" Collingridge]] ([[David Lyon (actor)|David Lyon]]) emerges victorious. Urquhart is secretly contemptuous of the well-meaning but weak Collingridge, but expects a promotion to a senior position in the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]]. After the general election, which the party wins by a reduced majority, Urquhart submits his suggestions for a [[reshuffle]] that includes his desired promotion. However, Collingridge \u2013 citing [[Harold Macmillan]]'s political demise after the 1962 [[Night of the Long Knives (1962)|Night of the Long Knives]] \u2013 effects no changes at all. Urquhart resolves to oust Collingridge, with encouragement from his wife, [[Elizabeth Urquhart|Elizabeth]] ([[Diane Fletcher]]).\n\nAt the same time, with Elizabeth's blessing, Urquhart begins an affair with [[Mattie Storin]] ([[Susannah Harker]]), a junior political reporter at a Conservative-leaning [[tabloid newspaper]] called ''The Chronicle''. The affair allows Urquhart to manipulate Mattie and indirectly skew her coverage of the Conservative leadership contest in his favour. Mattie has an apparent [[Electra complex]]; she finds appeal in Urquhart's much older age and later refers to him as \"Daddy.\" Another unwitting pawn is Roger O'Neill ([[Miles Anderson]]), the party's [[cocaine]]-addicted public relations consultant.\n\nUrquhart [[blackmail]]s O'Neill into leaking information on budget cuts that humiliates Collingridge during the [[Prime Minister's Questions]]. Later, he blames [[Chairman of the Conservative Party|party chairman]] [[List of House of Cards trilogy characters#Lord 'Teddy' Billsborough|Lord \"Teddy\" Billsborough]] ([[Nicholas Selby]]) for leaking an internal poll showing a drop in [[Tory]] numbers, leading Collingridge to sack him. As Collingridge's image suffers, Urquhart encourages ultraconservative [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] [[List of House of Cards trilogy characters#Patrick Woolton, MP|Patrick Woolton]] ([[Malcolm Tierney]]) and ''Chronicle'' owner Benjamin Landless to support his removal. Urquhart also poses as Collingridge's alcoholic brother Charles ([[James Villiers]]), to trade shares in a chemical company about to benefit from advance information confidential to the government. Consequently, Collingridge becomes falsely accused of [[insider trading]] and is forced to resign.\n\nIn the ensuing leadership race, Urquhart initially feigns unwillingness to stand before announcing his candidacy. With the help of his underling, [[Tim Stamper (fictional character)|Tim Stamper]] ([[Colin Jeavons]]), Urquhart goes about making sure his competitors drop out of the race: [[Secretary of State for Health|Health Secretary]] Peter MacKenzie (Christopher Owen) accidentally runs his car over a disabled protester at a demonstration staged by Urquhart and is forced by the public outcry to withdraw, while [[Secretary of State for Education|Education Secretary]] Harold Earle (Kenneth Gilbert) is blackmailed into withdrawing when Urquhart anonymously sends pictures of him in the company of a [[Male prostitution|rent boy]] whom Earle had paid for sex.\n\nThe first ballot leaves Urquhart to face Woolton and [[List of House of Cards trilogy characters#Michael Samuels|Michael Samuels]], the moderate [[Secretary of State for the Environment|Environment Secretary]] supported by Billsborough. Urquhart eliminates Woolton by a prolonged scheme: at the [[party conference]], he pressures O'Neill into persuading his personal assistant and lover, Penny Guy ([[Alphonsia Emmanuel]]), to have a [[one-night stand]] with Woolton in his suite, which Urquhart records via a bugged [[ministerial red box]]. When the tape is sent to Woolton, he is led to assume that Samuels is behind the scheme and backs Urquhart in the contest. Urquhart also receives support from Collingridge, who is unaware of Urquhart's role in his own downfall. Samuels is forced out of the running when the tabloids reveal that he backed leftist causes as a student at [[University of Cambridge]].\n\nStumbling across contradictions in the allegations against Collingridge and his brother, Mattie begins to dig deeper. On Urquhart's orders, O'Neill arranges for her car and flat to be vandalised in a show of intimidation. However, O'Neill becomes increasingly uneasy with what he is being asked to do, and his cocaine addiction adds to his instability. Urquhart mixes O'Neill's cocaine with rat poison, causing him to kill himself when taking the cocaine in a motorway lavatory. Though initially blind to the truth of matters thanks to her relations with Urquhart, Mattie eventually deduces that Urquhart is responsible for O'Neill's death and is behind the unfortunate downfalls of Collingridge and all of Urquhart's rivals.\n\nMattie looks for Urquhart at the point when it seems his victory is certain. She eventually finds him on the roof garden of the [[Houses of Parliament]], where she confronts him. He admits to O'Neill's murder and everything else he has done. He then asks whether he can trust Mattie, and, though she answers in the affirmative, he does not believe her and throws her off the roof onto a van parked below. An unseen person picks up Mattie's tape recorder, which she had been using to secretly record her conversations with Urquhart. The series ends with Urquhart defeating Samuels in the second leadership ballot and being driven to [[Buckingham Palace]] to be invited to form a government by [[Elizabeth II]].\n\n==Deviations from the novel in the series==\nIn the first novel, but not in the television series:\n* Urquhart never speaks directly to the reader; the character is written solely in a [[Third-person narrative|third-person]] perspective.\n* When alone, Urquhart is much less self-assured and decisive. \n* Mattie Storin works for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''. (In the television series she is a journalist with the fictional ''Chronicle'' newspaper.)\n* Mattie Storin does not have a relationship with Urquhart; she does not even talk to him frequently. She does, however, have a sexual relationship with John Krajewski.\n* Urquhart's wife is called Miranda and is a minor character, not sharing in his schemes. (In the later novels, ''[[To Play the King]]'' and ''[[The Final Cut (TV serial)|The Final Cut]]'', however, she is called \"[[Minor characters in the House of Cards trilogy#Elizabeth Urquhart|Elizabeth]]\" and plays a larger role, as in the television series.)\n* The Conservative [[party conference]] is held in [[Bournemouth]]. (In the television series it occurs in [[Brighton]].)\n* The minor character [[Minor characters in the House of Cards trilogy#Tim Stamper, MP|Tim Stamper]] is introduced for the on-screen adaptation (although Dobbs introduces him in the novel ''To Play the King'').\n* Earle's [[rent boy]] appears in person at an important speech of Earle's, distracting him; subsequently, Earle is harassed by reporters who have been told of his indiscretion.\n* In the final confrontation scene Urquhart throws himself from the roof terrace and Mattie survives.\n\nBefore the series was reissued in 2013 to coincide with the release of the US version of ''[[House of Cards (U.S. TV series)|House of Cards]]'', Dobbs rewrote portions of the novel to bring the series in line with the television mini-series and restore continuity among the three novels.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} In the 2013 version:\n\n*Urquhart murders Mattie Storin, throwing her off the roof after she confronts Urquhart about his actions. \n*Mattie Storin does not scream \"Daddy\" as she falls. \n*Urquhart covers up his murder of Mattie Storin by claiming she was an obsessed stalker who was mentally ill and vows to make mental health amongst the young a priority policy-wise.   \n*Mattie Storin works for newspaper ''The Chronicle'', per the TV series.\n*Urquhart's wife Miranda is changed to Mortima.\n*Tim Stamper, though present in the TV mini-series, does not appear in the revised version of the novel.\n*Urquhart makes asides to the audience in the form of epigraphs at the beginning of each chapter (the original novel has no chapters).\n\n==Reception==\nThe first installment of the TV series coincidentally aired two days before the [[Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 1990|Conservative Party leadership election]].<ref name=Richardsons-rule/> Author Dobbs said that [[John Major]]'s leadership headquarters \"came to a halt\" to view the show.<ref name=\"daily mail\">{{cite news | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-435108/House-Cards-actor-Ian-Richardson-dies-sleep.html | title=House of Cards actor Ian Richardson dies in his sleep\n | publisher=Daily Mail | accessdate=16 July 2009 | location=London | date=9 February 2007}}</ref> During a time of \"disillusionment with politics\", the series \"caught the nation's mood\".<ref name=\"independent\">{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/ian-richardson-the-pm-who-couldnt-possibly-comment-dies-aged-72-435815.html | title=Ian Richardson, the PM who couldn't possibly comment, dies aged 72| publisher=The Independent| accessdate=16 July 2009 | location=London | first=Terry | last=Kirby | date=10 February 2007}}</ref>\n\nIan Richardson won a Best Actor [[BAFTA]] in 1991 for his role as Urquhart, and Andrew Davies won an [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Miniseries, Movie or a Dramatic Special#1990s|Emmy]] for outstanding writing in a miniseries.\n\nThe series ranked 84th in the [[British Film Institute]] list of the [[100 Greatest British Television Programmes]].<ref name=BFI100/>\n\n==American adaptation==\n{{main|House of Cards (U.S. TV series)}}\nThe Urquhart trilogy has been adapted in the United States as ''[[House of Cards (U.S. TV series)|House of Cards]]''.

In 1918, aged 21, she moved to [[Washington, D.C.]], where she later took classes at [[Strayer Business College]] and [[George Washington University Law School]].{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n==Career==\nGandy briefly worked in a department store in Washington before finding a job as a file clerk at the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] in 1918. Within weeks, she went to work as a typist for Hoover, effective March 25, 1918, having told Hoover in her interview she had \"no immediate plans to marry.\" She, like Hoover, would never marry; both were completely devoted to the Bureau.\n\n[[Image:Hoover-JEdgar-LOC.jpg|thumb|upright|[[J. Edgar Hoover]], director of the F.B.I, photographed in 1961. Gandy worked for him from 1918 to his death in 1972.]]\n\nWhen Hoover went to the Bureau of Investigation (its original title; it became the F.B.I. in 1935) as its assistant director on August 22, 1921, he specifically requested Gandy return from vacation to help him in the new post. Hoover became director of the Bureau in 1924, and Gandy continued in his service. She was promoted to \"office assistant\" on August 23, 1937 and \"executive assistant\" on October 1, 1939. Though she would receive promotions in her civil service grade subsequently, she retained her title as executive assistant until her retirement on May 2, 1972, the day Hoover died. Hoover said of her: \"if there is anyone in this Bureau whose services are indispensable, I consider Miss Gandy to be that person.\"  Despite this, [[Curt Gentry]] wrote:\n\n<blockquote>Theirs was a rigidly formal relationship. He'd always called her 'Miss Gandy' (when angry, barking it out as one word). In all those fifty-four years he had never once called her by her first name.</blockquote>\n\nHoover biographers [[Athan Theoharis|Theoharis]] and Cox would say \"her stern face recalled [[Cerberus]] at the gate,\"<ref name=TheoCox/> a view echoed by [[Anthony Summers]] in his life of Hoover, who also pictured Gandy as Hoover's first line of defense against the outside world.<ref>Anthony Summers.

Yet behind the politeness was a resolute firmness not unlike his, and no small amount of influence. Many a career in the Bureau had been quietly manipulated by her. Even those who disliked him, praised her, most often commenting on her remarkable ability to get along with all kinds of people. That she had held her position for fifty-four years was the best evidence of this, for it was a Bureau tradition that the closer you were to him, the more demanding he was.</blockquote>\n\n[[William C. Sullivan]], an agent with the Bureau for three decades, reported in his memoir when he worked in the [[public relations]] section answering mail from the public, he  gave a correspondent the wrong measurements for Hoover's personal [[Popovers|popover]] recipe, relying on memory rather than the files. Gandy, ever protective of her boss, caught the error and brought it to Hoover's attention. The director then placed an official [[letter of reprimand]] in Sullivan's file for the lapse. [[Mark Felt]], deputy associate director of the Bureau, wrote in his memoir that Gandy \"was bright and alert and quick-tempered&mdash;and completely dedicated to her boss.\"{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n===Files===\n\nHoover died during the night of May 1\u20132, 1972. According to [[Curt Gentry]], who wrote the 1991 book ''J Edgar Hoover: The Man and the Secrets'', Hoover's body was not discovered by his live-in cook and general housekeeper, Annie Fields; rather, it was discovered by James Crawford, who had been Hoover's chauffeur for 37 years. Crawford then yelled out to Fields and Tom Moton (Hoover's new chauffeur after Crawford had retired in January 1972). Ms. Fields first called Hoover's personal physician, Dr. Robert Choisser, then used another phone to call [[Clyde Tolson]]'s private number. Tolson then called Helen Gandy's private number with the news of Hoover's death along with orders to begin destroying the files. Within an hour, the \"D List\" (\"d\" standing for destruction) was being distributed, and the destruction of files began. However, ''[[The New York Times]]'' quoted an anonymous F.B.I. source in spring 1975, who said: \"Gandy had begun almost a year before Mr. Hoover's death and was instructed to purge the files that were then in his office.\"\n\n[[Image:Patrickgrey.jpeg|right|frame|[[L. Patrick Gray]], was appointed Acting FBI Director by [[President Nixon]] after Hoover's death.]]\nAnthony Summers reported that [[G. Gordon Liddy]] had said of his sources in the F.B.I.: \"by the time [[L. Patrick Gray|Gray]] went in to get the files, Miss Gandy had already got rid of them.\" The day after Hoover died, Gray, who had been named acting director by President [[Richard Nixon]] upon Tolson's resignation from that position, went to Hoover's office. Gandy paused from her work to give Gray a tour. He found file cabinets open and packing boxes being filled with papers. She informed him the boxes contained personal papers of Hoover's. Gandy stated Gray flipped through a few files and approved her work, but Gray was to deny he looked at any papers. Gandy also told Gray it would be a week before she could clear Hoover's effects out so Gray could move into the suite.\n\nGray reported to Nixon that he had secured Hoover's office and its contents. However, he had sealed only Hoover's personal inner office, where no files were stored, not the entire suite of offices. Since 1957, Hoover's \"Official/Confidential\" files, containing material too sensitive to include in the Bureau's central files, had been kept in the outer office, where Gandy sat. Gentry reported that Gray would not have known where to look in Gandy's office for the files, as her office was lined floor to ceiling with filing cabinets; moreover, without her index to the files, he would not have been able to locate incriminating material, for files were deliberately mislabeled, e.g., President Nixon's file was labeled \"Obscene Matters\".\n\nOn May 4, Gandy turned over 12 boxes labelled \"Official/Confidential\", containing 167 files and 17,750 pages, to [[W. Mark Felt|Mark Felt]].  Many of them contained derogatory information. Gray told the press that afternoon that \"there are no dossiers or secret files. There are just general files and I took steps to preserve their integrity.\" Gandy retained the \"Personal File\".\n\nGandy worked on going through Hoover's \"Personal File\" in the office until May 12. She then transferred at least 32 file drawers of material to the basement [[recreation room|rec room]] of Hoover's Washington home at 4936 Thirtieth Place, NW, where she continued her work from May 13 to July 17. Gandy later testified nothing official had been removed from the Bureau's offices, \"not even his badge.\" At Hoover's residence the destruction was overseen by [[John P. Mohr]], the number three man in the Bureau after Hoover and Tolson. They were aided by [[James Jesus Angleton]], the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]'s counterintelligence chief, whom Hoover's neighbors saw removing boxes from Hoover's home. Mohr would claim the boxes Angleton removed were cases of spoiled wine.\n\nWhen the [[United States House of Representatives|House]] [[United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform|Committee on Government Oversight]] investigated the F.B.I.'s spying on and harassment of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] and others in 1975, Gandy was called to testify. \"I tore them up, put them in boxes, and they were taken away to be shredded,\" she told the congressmen about the papers. The Bureau's Washington field office had F.B.I. drivers transport the material to Hoover's home, then once Gandy had gone through the material, the drivers transported it back to the field office in the [[Old Post Office Building (Washington)|Old Post Office Building]] on Pennsylvania Avenue, where it was shredded and burned.\n\nGandy stated that Hoover had left standing instructions to destroy his personal papers upon his death, and that this instruction was confirmed by Tolson and Gray. Gandy stated that she destroyed no official papers, that everything was personal papers of Hoover's. The staff of the subcommittee did not believe her, but she told the committee: \"I have no reason to lie.\"  Representative [[Andrew Maguire]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]-[[New Jersey]]), a freshman member of the [[94th United States Congress|94th Congress]], said \"I find your testimony very difficult to believe.\" Gandy held her ground: \"That is your privilege.\"\n\n\"I can give you my word. I know what there was&mdash;letters to and from friends, personal friends, a lot of letters,\" she testified. Gandy also said the files she took to his home also included his financial papers, such as tax returns and investment statements, the deed to his home, and papers relating to his dogs' pedigrees.\n\nCurt Gentry wrote:\n\n:Helen Gandy must have felt quite safe in testifying as she did for who could contradict her?  Only one other person knew exactly what the files contained and he was dead.\n\nIn ''J. Edgar Hoover: The Man and His Secrets'', Gentry describes the nature of the files:<ref>Bardsley, Marilyn. \"[http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/gangsters_outlaws/cops_others/hoover/2.html The Life and Career of J.

In 1702, [[Thomas Savery]] wrote in ''The Miner's Friend'':\n\n<blockquote>So that an engine which will raise as much water as two horses, working together at one time in such a work, can do, and for which there must be constantly kept ten or twelve horses for doing the same.

Hydraulic power is still needed though, as between 2 and 7&nbsp;hp are required to push [[drilling mud|mud]] through the drill bit to clear waste rock. Additional  hydraulic power  may also be used to drive a down-hole mud motor to power [[directional drilling]].<ref name=\"Schlumberger, Hydraulic horsepower\" />\n\n=== Boiler horsepower ===\nBoiler horsepower is a [[steam boiler|boiler]]'s capacity to deliver [[steam]] to a [[steam engine]] and is not the same unit of power as the 550&nbsp;ft-lb/s definition. One boiler horsepower is equal to the thermal energy rate required to evaporate 34.5&nbsp;lb of fresh water at 212&nbsp;\u00b0F in one hour. In the early days of steam use, the boiler horsepower was roughly comparable to the horsepower of engines fed by the boiler.<ref>Robert McCain Johnston ''Elements of Applied Thermodynamics'', Naval Institute Press, 1992 {{ISBN|1557502269}}, p. 503.</ref>\n\nThe term \"boiler horsepower\" was originally developed at the [[Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition]] in 1876, where the best steam engines of that period were tested.  The average steam consumption of those engines (per output horsepower) was determined to be the evaporation of 30 pounds of water per hour, based on feed water at 100&nbsp;\u00b0F, and saturated steam generated at 70 [[psig]].  This original definition is equivalent to a boiler heat output of 33,485 Btu/h.  Years later in 1884, the [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers|ASME]] re-defined the boiler horsepower as the thermal output equal to the evaporation of 34.5 pounds per hour of water \"from and at\" 212&nbsp;\u00b0F.  This considerably simplified boiler testing, and provided more accurate comparisons of the boilers at that time. This revised definition is equivalent to a boiler heat output of 33,469 Btu/h.  Present industrial practice is to define \"boiler horsepower\" as a boiler thermal output equal to 33,475 Btu/h, which is very close to the original and revised definitions.\n\nBoiler horsepower is still used to measure boiler output in industrial boiler engineering in Australia, the US, and New Zealand. Boiler horsepower is abbreviated BHP, not to be confused with brake horsepower, below, which is also abbreviated BHP.\n\n===Drawbar horsepower===\n{{See also|Power at rail}}\n\nDrawbar horsepower (dbhp) is the power a [[railway]] [[locomotive]] has available to haul a [[train]] or an agricultural tractor to pull an implement. This is a measured figure rather than a calculated one. A special [[railway car]] called a [[dynamometer car]] coupled behind the locomotive keeps a continuous record of the [[drawbar (haulage)|drawbar]] pull exerted, and the speed. From these, the power generated can be calculated. To determine the maximum power available, a controllable load is required; it is normally a second locomotive with its brakes applied, in addition to a static load.\n\nIf the drawbar force (<math>F</math>) is measured in pounds-force (lbf) and speed (<math>v</math>) is measured in miles per hour (mph), then the drawbar power (<math>P</math>) in horsepower (hp) is:\n\n:<math>P / {\\rm hp} = {(F / {\\rm lbf}) (v / {\\rm mph}) \\over 375}</math>\n\nExample: How much power is needed to pull a drawbar load of 2,025 pounds-force at 5 miles per hour?\n\n:<math>P / {\\rm hp} = {{2025 \\times 5 } \\over 375} = 27</math>\n\nThe constant 375 is because 1&nbsp;hp = 375&nbsp;lbf\u22c5mph. If other units are used, the constant is different. When using coherent [[SI]] units (watts, newtons, and metres per second), no constant is needed, and the formula becomes <math>P = Fv</math>.\n\nThis formula may also be used to calculate the horsepower of a jet engine, using the speed of the jet and the thrust required to maintain that speed.\n\nExample: How much power is generated with a thrust of 4,000 pounds at 400 miles per hour?\n\n:<math>P / {\\rm hp} = {{4000 \\times 400 } \\over 375} = 4266.7</math>\n\n===RAC horsepower (taxable horsepower)===\n\n{{See also|Tax horsepower}}\nThis measure was instituted by the [[Royal Automobile Club]] in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and was used to denote the power of early 20th-century British [[automobile|cars]]. (An identical measure, known as [[ALAM]] horsepower or [[National Automobile Chamber of Commerce|NACC]] horsepower, was used for early U.S. automobiles.) Many cars took their names from this figure (hence the [[Austin Motor Company|Austin]] Seven and [[Riley (automobile)|Riley]] Nine), while others had names such as \"40/50 hp\", which indicated the RAC figure followed by the true measured power.\n\nTaxable horsepower does not reflect developed horsepower; rather, it is a calculated figure based on the engine's bore size, number of cylinders, and a (now archaic) presumption of engine efficiency. As new engines were designed with ever-increasing efficiency, it was no longer a useful measure, but was kept in use by UK regulations which used the rating for [[tax horsepower|tax purposes]].\n\n:<math>\\text{RAC h.p.}=\\frac{2}{5}D^2 n</math>\n\n:where\n\n: ''D'' is the diameter (or [[Bore (engine)|bore]]) of the cylinder in inches\n: ''n'' is the number of cylinders<ref>{{Cite web |url= http://www.designchambers.com/wolfhound/wolfhoundRACHP.htm |title= The RAC HP (horsepower) Rating - Was there any technical basis? |first= Richard |last= Hodgson |publisher=wolfhound.org.uk |accessdate=2007-08-11 |postscript=}}</ref>\n\nThis is equal to the [[engine displacement]] in cubic inches divided by 0.625\u03c0 then divided again by the [[Stroke (engine)|stroke]] in inches.\n\nSince taxable horsepower was computed based on bore and number of cylinders, not based on actual displacement, it gave rise to engines with 'undersquare' dimensions (bore smaller than stroke) this tended to impose an artificially low limit on rotational speed ([[revolutions per minute|rpm]]), hampering the potential power output and efficiency of the engine.\n\nThe situation persisted for several generations of four- and six-cylinder British engines: for example, [[Jaguar (car)|Jaguar's]] 3.4-litre XK engine of the 1950s had six cylinders with a bore of {{convert|83|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} and a stroke of {{convert|106|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=3}},<ref>{{Cite web|first=Dan |last=Mooney |url=http://www.classicjaguar.com/xkengine.html |title=The XK engine by Roger Bywater |publisher=Classicjaguar.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-13 |postscript= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100223052130/http://www.classicjaguar.com/xkengine.html |archivedate=2010-02-23 |df= }}</ref> where most American automakers had long since moved to oversquare (large bore, short stroke) [[V8 engine|V-8s]] (see, for example, the early [[Chrysler FirePower engine|Chrysler Hemi]]).\n\n==Measurement==\n\nThe power of an engine may be measured or estimated at several points in the transmission of the power from its generation to its application. A number of names are used for the power developed at various stages in this process, but none is a clear indicator of either the measurement system or definition used.\n\nIn the case of an engine [[dynamometer]], power is measured at the engine's [[flywheel]].{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Also, with a chassis dynamometer or ''rolling road'', power output is measured at the driving wheels.

It is calculated from the pressures developed in the cylinders, measured by a device called an ''[[indicator diagram|engine indicator]]'' \u2013 hence indicated horsepower. As the piston advances throughout its stroke, the pressure against the piston generally decreases, and the indicator device usually generates a graph of pressure vs stroke within the working cylinder. From this graph the amount of work performed during the piston stroke may be calculated.\n\nIndicated horsepower was a better measure of engine power than nominal horsepower (nhp) because it took account of steam pressure.  But unlike later measures such as shaft horsepower (shp) and brake horsepower (bhp), it did not take into account power losses due to the machinery internal frictional losses, such as a piston sliding within the cylinder, plus bearing friction, transmission and gear box friction, etc.\n\n==={{anchor|brake horsepower|bhp|Brake_horsepower_.28bhp.29}} Brake horsepower===\nBrake horsepower (bhp) is the power measured at the crankshaft just outside the engine, before the losses of power caused by the gearbox and drive train.\n\nIn Europe, the [[horsepower#Deutsches Institut f\u00fcr Normung 70020 (DIN 70020)|DIN 70020]] standard tests the engine fitted with all ancillaries and exhaust system as used in the car. The older American standard ([[Horsepower#SAE gross power|SAE gross horsepower]], referred to as bhp) used an engine without alternator, water pump, and other auxiliary components such as power steering pump, muffled exhaust system, etc., so the figures were higher than the European figures for the same engine. The newer American standard (referred to as [[Horsepower#SAE net power|SAE net horsepower]]) tests an engine with all the auxiliary components (see \"Engine power test standards\" below).\n\nBrake refers to the device which was used to load an engine and hold it at a desired rotational speed. During testing, the output torque and rotational speed were measured to determine the brake horsepower. Horsepower was originally measured and calculated by use of the \"indicator diagram\" (a James Watt invention of the late 18th century), and later by means of a [[Prony brake]] connected to the engine's output shaft. More recently, an electrical brake [[dynamometer]] is used instead of a Prony brake. Although the output delivered to the drive wheels is less than that obtainable at the engine's crankshaft, use of a chassis dynamometer gives an indication of an engine's \"real world\" horsepower after losses in the drive train and gearbox.\n\n===Shaft horsepower===\nShaft horsepower (shp) is the power delivered to a propeller shaft, a turbine shaft \u2013 or to an output shaft of an automotive transmission.<ref>[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/shaft_horsepower Oxford Dictionary. Retrieved 2016-12-06.] [http://www.dictionary.com/browse/shaft-horsepower Dictionary.com Unabridged, Random House Inc. Retrieved 2016-12-06.]</ref> This shaft horsepower can be measured with a [[Torque sensor|torque (torsion) meter]], or estimated from the horsepower at the crankshaft and a standard figure for the losses in the transmission (typical figures are around 10%). Shaft horsepower is a common rating for jet engines, industrial turbines, and some marine applications. Reciprocating internal-combustion [[automobile]] engines are rated instead in the US by SAE certified net power, which is measured at the engine's crankshaft, and so does not account for losses in the transmission.\n\nEquivalent shaft horsepower (eshp) is sometimes used to rate [[turboprop]] engines. It includes the equivalent power derived from jet thrust.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aviation_dictionary.enacademic.com/2550/equivalent_shaft_horsepower|title=equivalent shaft horsepower|website=aviation_dictionary.enacademic.com}}</ref>\n\n===Wheel horsepower===\nMotor vehicle dynamometers can measure wheel horsepower (whp), which is the effective, true horsepower delivered to the driving wheel(s), representing the actual power available to accelerate the vehicle after all losses in the drive train, and all parasitic losses such as pumps, fans, alternator, muffled exhaust, etc.  The vehicle is generally attached to the dynamometer and accelerates a large roller and Power Absorbing Unit which is driven by the vehicle's drive wheel(s).  The actual power is then computer calculated based on the rotational inertia of the roller, its resultant acceleration rates and power applied by the Power Absorbing Unit. Some motor vehicle (and motorbike) dynamometers can also be purely inertia-based where the power output is calculated from measuring the acceleration of a roller drum with a known rotational inertia and known parasitic frictional losses of the roller drum's bearings.\n\n==Engine power test standards==\nThere exist a number of different standard determining how the power and torque of an automobile engine is measured and corrected. Correction factors are used to adjust power and torque measurements to standard atmospheric conditions, to provide a more accurate comparison between engines as they are affected by the pressure, humidity, and temperature of ambient air.<ref>Heywood, J.B. \"Internal Combustion Engine Fundamentals\", {{ISBN|0-07-100499-8}}, page 54</ref> Some standards are described below.\n\n===Society of Automotive Engineers/SAE International===\n\n====Early \"SAE horsepower\" (see [[Horsepower#RAC horsepower (taxable horsepower)|RAC horsepower]])====\nIn the early twentieth century, a so-called \"SAE horsepower\" was sometimes quoted for U.S. automobiles. This long predates the [[Society of Automotive Engineers|Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE)]] horsepower measurement standards and was really just another term for the widely used ALAM or NACC horsepower figure, which was the same as the British RAC horsepower, used for tax purposes.\n\n====SAE gross power====\nPrior to the 1972 model year, American automakers rated and advertised their engines in brake horsepower, ''[[horsepower#Brake horsepower (bhp)|bhp]]'', which was a version of brake horsepower called SAE gross horsepower because it was measured according to Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) standards (J245 and J1995) that call for a stock test engine without accessories (such as dynamo/alternator, radiator fan, water pump),<ref name=\"Lucchesi\" /> and sometimes fitted with long tube test [[Exhaust manifold|headers]] in lieu of the [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEM]] exhaust manifolds. This contrasts with both [[horsepower#SAE net power|SAE net power]] and [[horsepower#Deutsches Institut f\u00fcr Normung 70020 (DIN 70020)|DIN 70020]] standards, which account for engine accessories (but not transmission losses). The atmospheric correction standards for barometric pressure, humidity and temperature for SAE gross power testing were relatively idealistic.\n\n====SAE net power====\nIn the United States, the term ''[[horsepower#Brake horsepower (bhp)|bhp]]'' fell into disuse in 1971\u20131972, as automakers began to quote power in terms of SAE net horsepower in accord with SAE standard J1349. Like [[horsepower#SAE gross power|SAE gross]] and other brake horsepower protocols, SAE net hp is measured at the engine's crankshaft, and so does not account for transmission losses. However, similar to the [[horsepower#Deutsches Institut f\u00fcr Normung 70020 (DIN 70020)|DIN 70020]] standard, SAE net power testing protocol calls for standard production-type belt-driven accessories, air cleaner, emission controls, exhaust system, and other power-consuming accessories. This produces ratings in closer alignment with the power produced by the engine as it is actually configured and sold.\n\n====SAE certified power====\nIn 2005, the SAE introduced \"SAE Certified Power\" with SAE J2723.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sae.org/certifiedpower/ |title=Certified Power - SAE J1349 Certified Power SAE International |publisher=Sae.org |date= |accessdate=2011-07-18}}</ref> This test is voluntary and is in itself not a separate engine test code but a certification of either J1349 or J1995 after which the manufacturer is allowed to advertise \"Certified to SAE J1349\" or \"Certified to SAE J1995\" depending on which test standard have been followed. To attain certification the test must follow the SAE standard in question, take place in an [[ISO 9000]]/9002 certified facility and be witnessed by an SAE approved third party.\n\nA few manufacturers such as Honda and Toyota switched to the new ratings immediately, with multi-directional results; the rated output of [[Cadillac|Cadillac's]] [[supercharger|supercharged]] [[GM Premium V engine#Supercharged|Northstar]] V8 jumped from {{convert|440|to|469|hp|kW|abbr=on}} under the new tests, while the rating for [[Toyota Motor Corporation|Toyota's]] [[Toyota Camry|Camry]] 3.0&nbsp;L ''[[Toyota MZ engine#1MZ-FE|1MZ-FE]]'' V6 fell from {{convert|210|to|190|hp|kW|abbr=on}}. The company's Lexus ES 330 and Camry SE V6 were previously rated at {{convert|225|hp|kW|abbr=on}} but the ES 330 dropped to {{convert|218|hp|kW|abbr=on}} while the Camry declined to {{convert|210|hp|kW|abbr=on}}. The first engine certified under the new program was the 7.0&nbsp;L [[GM LS engine#7.0 L|LS7]] used in the 2006 [[Chevrolet Corvette]] Z06.  Certified power rose slightly from {{convert|500|to|505|hp|kW|sigfig=3|abbr=on}}.\n\nWhile Toyota and Honda are retesting their entire vehicle lineups, other automakers generally are retesting only those with updated powertrains. For example, the 2006 Ford Five Hundred is rated at 203 horsepower, the same as that of 2005 model. However, the 2006 rating does not reflect the new SAE testing procedure, as Ford is not going to incur the extra expense of retesting its existing engines. Over time, most automakers are expected to comply with the new guidelines.\n\nSAE tightened its horsepower rules to eliminate the opportunity for engine manufacturers to manipulate factors affecting performance such as how much oil was in the crankcase, engine control system calibration, and whether an engine was tested with premium fuel. In some cases, such can add up to a change in horsepower ratings. A road test editor at Edmunds.com, John Di Pietro, said decreases in horsepower ratings for some 2006 models are not that dramatic. For vehicles like a midsize family sedan, it is likely that the reputation of the manufacturer will be more important.<ref>Jeff Plungis, ''Asians Oversell Horsepower'', Detroit News</ref>\n\n==={{anchor|DIN|70020}}''Deutsches Institut f\u00fcr Normung'' 70020 (DIN 70020)===\nDIN 70020 is a [[Germany|German]] [[DIN]] standard for measuring road vehicle horsepower. Similar to [[horsepower#SAE gross power|SAE net power]] rating, and unlike [[horsepower#SAE gross power|SAE gross power]], DIN testing measures the engine as installed in the vehicle, with cooling system, charging system and stock exhaust system all connected.  DIN 70020 is often seen abbreviated as \"PS\", derived from the German word for horsepower ''[[#Metric horsepower|Pferdest\u00e4rke]]''. DIN hp is measured at the engine's output shaft, usually expressed in metric horsepower rather than [[#Mechanical horsepower|mechanical horsepower]].\n\n===CUNA===\nA test standard by [[Italy|Italian]] CUNA (''Commissione Tecnica per l'Unificazione nell'Automobile'', Technical Commission for Automobile Unification), a federated entity of [[standards organisation]] [[Ente Nazionale Italiano di Unificazione|UNI]], was formerly used in Italy.\nCUNA prescribed that the engine be tested with all accessories necessary to its running fitted (such as the water pump), while all others\u2014such as alternator/dynamo, radiator fan, and exhaust manifold\u2014could be omitted.<ref name=\"Lucchesi\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.it/books?id=FVF6CERm7poC&pg=PA550 |first=Domenico |last=Lucchesi |title=Corso di tecnica automobilistica, vol. 1<sup>o</sup>\u2014Il motore |page=550 |publisher=[[Hoepli|Ulrico Hoepli Editore S.p.A.]] |edition=6th |year=2004 |language=it |isbn=88-203-1493-2}}</ref> All calibration and accessories had to be as on production engines.<ref name=\"Lucchesi\" />\n\n==={{anchor|ECE R24}}Economic Commission for Europe R24===\nECE R24 is a [[UNECE Regulations|UN standard]] for the approval of compression ignition engine emissions, installation and measurement of engine power.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unece.org/trans/main/wp29/wp29regs/r024r2e.pdf|title=Text of the 1958 Agreement, ECE Regulation 24, Revision 2, Annex 10|website=www.unece.org}}</ref> It is similar to DIN 70020 standard, but with different requirements for connecting an engine's fan during testing causing it to absorb less power from the engine.<ref>{{cite web |first=Jim |last=Breen |url=http://www.farmersjournal.ie/2003/0322/farmmanagement/machinery/tractor.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20030406025121/http://www.farmersjournal.ie/2003/0322/farmmanagement/machinery/tractor.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2003-04-06 |title=Farmers Journal: Tractor and machine comparison: what's the \u2018true' measure - 22 March 2003 |publisher=Farmersjournal.ie |date=2003-03-22 }}</ref>\n\n==={{anchor|ECE R85}}Economic Commission for Europe R85===\nECE R85 is a [[UNECE Regulations|UN standard]] for the approval of internal combustion engines with regard to the measurement of the net power.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://live.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/trans/main/wp29/wp29regs/r085e.pdf |title=ECE Regulation 85 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-07-18}}</ref>\n\n===80/1269/EEC===\n[[Directive 80/1269/EEC|80/1269/EEC]] of 16 December 1980 is a European Union standard for road vehicle engine power.\n\n==={{anchor|ISO}}International Organization for Standardization===\nThe [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) publishes several standards for measuring engine horsepower.\n* [[ISO 14396]] specifies the additional and method requirement for determining the power of reciprocating internal combustion engines when presented for an [[ISO 8178]] exhaust emission test.

[[Trinovantes]] were the [[Iron Age]] tribe who inhabited the area prior to the Romans. Geoffrey provides prehistoric London with a rich array of legendary kings, such as [[Lud son of Heli|Lud]] (see also [[Lludd Llaw Eraint|Lludd, from Welsh mythology]]) who, he claims, renamed the town ''Caer Ludein'', from which London was derived, and was buried at [[Ludgate]].\n\nSome recent discoveries indicate probable very early settlements near the Thames in the London area.

Archaeology Data Service, The University of York.</ref> after the [[Roman conquest of Britain|invasion of AD 43]]. London, like Rome, was founded on the point of the river where it was narrow enough to bridge and the strategic location of the city provided easy access to much of Europe. Early Roman London occupied a relatively small area, roughly equivalent to the size of [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]]. In around AD 60, it was destroyed by the [[Iceni]] led by their queen [[Boudica]]. The city was quickly rebuilt as a planned Roman town and recovered after perhaps 10 years, the city growing rapidly over the following decades.\n\nDuring the 2nd century ''Londinium'' was at its height and replaced [[Camulodunum|Colchester]] as the capital of [[Roman Britain]] (Britannia). Its population was around 60,000 inhabitants. It boasted major public buildings, including the largest [[basilica]] north of the Alps, [[Roman temple|temples]], [[Thermae|bath houses]], an [[amphitheatre]] and a large [[fort]] for the city garrison. Political instability and recession from the 3rd century onwards led to a slow decline.\n\nAt some time between AD 180 and AD 225, the Romans built the defensive [[London Wall]] around the landward side of the city. The wall was about {{convert|3|km|mi}} long, {{convert|6|m|ft}} high, and {{convert|2.5|m|ft}} thick. The wall would survive for another 1,600 years and define the [[City of London]]'s perimeters for centuries to come. The perimeters of the present City are roughly defined by the line of the ancient wall.\n\nLondonium was an ethnically diverse city with inhabitants from across the Roman Empire, including natives of Britannia, [[continental Europe]], the [[Middle East]], and [[North Africa]].<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-34809804 DNA study finds London was ethnically diverse from start], [[BBC]], 23 November 2015</ref>\n\nIn the late 3rd century, Londinium was raided on several occasions by Saxon pirates.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} This led, from around 255 onwards, to the construction of an additional riverside wall. Six of the traditional seven city gates of London are of Roman origin, namely: [[Ludgate]], [[Newgate]], [[Aldersgate]], [[Cripplegate]], [[Bishopsgate]] and [[Aldgate]] ([[Moorgate]] is the exception, being of medieval origin).\n\nBy the 5th century, the Roman Empire was in rapid decline and in AD 410, the Roman occupation of Britannia came to an end. Following this, the Roman city also went into rapid decline and by the end of the 5th century was practically abandoned.\n\n===Anglo-Saxon London (5th century \u2013 1066)===\n{{Main|Anglo-Saxon London}}\nUntil recently it was believed that [[Anglo-Saxon]] settlement initially avoided the area immediately around Londinium. However, the discovery in 2008 of an Anglo-Saxon cemetery at [[Covent Garden]] indicates that the incomers had begun to settle there at least as early as the 6th century and possibly in the 5th. The main focus of this settlement was outside the Roman walls, clustering a short distance to the west along what is now the [[Strand, London|Strand]], between the [[Aldwych]] and [[Trafalgar Square]]. It was known as ''Lundenwic'', the ''-wic'' suffix here denoting a trading settlement. Recent excavations have also highlighted the population density and relatively sophisticated urban organisation of this earlier Anglo-Saxon London, which was laid out on a grid pattern and grew to house a likely population of 10-12,000.\n\nEarly Anglo-Saxon London belonged to a people known as the [[Middle Saxons]], from whom the name of the county of [[Middlesex]] is derived, but who probably also occupied the approximate area of modern [[Hertfordshire]] and [[Surrey]]. However, by the early 7th century the London area had been incorporated into the kingdom of the [[East Saxons]]. In 604 King [[Saeberht of Essex]] converted to Christianity and London received [[Mellitus]], its first post-Roman bishop.\n\nAt this time Essex was under the overlordship of King [[\u00c6thelberht of Kent]], and it was under \u00c6thelberht's patronage that Mellitus founded the first [[St. Paul's Cathedral]], traditionally said to be on the site of an old Roman Temple of Diana (although [[Christopher Wren]] found no evidence of this). It would have only been a modest church at first and may well have been destroyed after he was expelled from the city by Saeberht's [[paganism|pagan]] successors.\n\nThe permanent establishment of Christianity in the East Saxon kingdom took place in the reign of King [[Sigeberht the Good|Sigeberht II]] in the 650s. During the 8th century, the kingdom of [[Mercia]] extended its dominance over south-eastern England, initially through overlordship which at times developed into outright annexation. London seems to have come under direct Mercian control in the 730s.\n\n[[File:Alfred the Great silver coin.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Silver coin of Alfred, with the legend ''\u00c6LFRED REX'']]\n[[File:Statue d'Alfred le Grand \u00e0 Winchester.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Statue of [[Alfred the Great]] at [[Winchester]], erected 1899]]\n\n[[Viking]] attacks dominated most of the 9th century, becoming increasingly common from around 830 onwards. London was sacked in 842 and again in 851. The [[Denmark|Danish]] \"[[Great Heathen Army]]\", which had rampaged across England since 865, wintered in London in 871. The city remained in Danish hands until 886, when it was captured by the forces of King [[Alfred the Great]] of [[Wessex]] and reincorporated into Mercia, then governed under Alfred's sovereignty by his son-in-law [[Ealdorman]] [[Earl Aethelred of Mercia|\u00c6thelred]].\n\n[[File:Southwark Bridge City Plaque.JPG|thumb|upright=1.1|Plaque in the [[City of London]] noting the re-establishment of the Roman walled city]]\n\nAround this time the focus of settlement moved within the old Roman walls for the sake of defence, and the city became known as ''[[Lundenburh]]''. The Roman walls were repaired and the defensive ditch re-cut, while the bridge was probably rebuilt at this time. A second fortified [[Borough]] was established on the south bank at [[Southwark]], the ''Suthringa Geworc'' (defensive work of the men of [[Surrey]]). The old settlement of ''Lundenwic'' became known as the ''ealdwic'' or \"old settlement\", a name which survives today as Aldwich.\n\nFrom this point, the City of London began to develop its own unique local government. Following Ethelred's death in 911 it was transferred to Wessex, preceding the absorption of the rest of Mercia in 918. Although it faced competition for political pre-eminence in the united [[Kingdom of England]] from the traditional West Saxon centre of [[Winchester]], London's size and commercial wealth brought it a steadily increasing importance as a focus of governmental activity. King [[Athelstan of England|Athelstan]] held many meetings of the ''witan'' in London and issued laws from there, while King [[\u00c6thelred the Unready]] issued the [[Laws of London]] there in 978.\n\nFollowing the resumption of Viking attacks in the reign of Ethelred, London was unsuccessfully attacked in 994 by an army under King [[Sweyn Forkbeard]] of Denmark. As English resistance to the sustained and escalating Danish onslaught finally collapsed in 1013, London repulsed an attack by the Danes and was the last place to hold out while the rest of the country submitted to Sweyn, but by the end of the year it too capitulated and \u00c6thelred fled abroad. Sweyn died just five weeks after having been proclaimed king and \u00c6thelred was restored to the throne, but Sweyn's son [[Canute the Great|Cnut]] returned to the attack in 1015.\n\nAfter \u00c6thelred's death at London in 1016 his son [[Edmund Ironside]] was proclaimed king there by the ''[[witangemot]]'' and left to gather forces in Wessex. London was then subjected to a systematic siege by Cnut but was relieved by King Edmund's army; when Edmund again left to recruit reinforcements in Wessex the Danes resumed the siege but were again unsuccessful. However, following his defeat at the [[Battle of Assandun]] Edmund ceded to Cnut all of England north of the Thames, including London, and his death a few weeks later left Cnut in control of the whole country.\n\nA Norse saga tells of a battle when King \u00c6thelred returned to attack Danish-occupied London. According to the saga, the Danes lined [[London Bridge]] and showered the attackers with spears. Undaunted, the attackers pulled the roofs off nearby houses and held them over their heads in the boats. Thus protected, they were able to get close enough to the bridge to attach ropes to the piers and pull the bridge down, thus ending the Viking occupation of London. This story presumably relates to \u00c6thelred's return to power after Sweyn's death in 1014, but there is no strong evidence of any such struggle for control of London on that occasion.\n\nFollowing the extinction of Cnut's dynasty in 1042 English rule was restored under [[Edward the Confessor]]. He was responsible for the foundation of [[Westminster Abbey]] and spent much of his time at [[Westminster]], which from this time steadily supplanted the City itself as the centre of government. Edward's death at Westminster in 1066 without a clear heir led to a succession dispute and the [[Norman conquest of England]]. Earl [[Harold Godwinson]] was elected king by the ''witangemot'' and crowned in Westminster Abbey but was defeated and killed by [[William I of England|William the Bastard, Duke of Normandy]] at the [[Battle of Hastings]]. The surviving members of the ''witan'' met in London and elected King Edward's young nephew [[Edgar the \u00c6theling]] as king.\n\nThe [[Normans]] advanced to the south bank of the Thames opposite London, where they defeated an English attack and burned Southwark but were unable to storm the bridge. They moved upstream and crossed the river at [[Wallingford, Oxfordshire|Wallingford]] before advancing on London from the north-west. The resolve of the English leadership to resist collapsed and the chief citizens of London went out together with the leading members of the Church and aristocracy to submit to William at [[Berkhamstead]], although according to some accounts there was a subsequent violent clash when the Normans reached the city. Having occupied London, William was crowned king in Westminster Abbey.\n\n===Norman and Medieval London (1066 \u2013 late 15th century)===\n{{Main|Norman and Medieval London}}\n[[File:towrlndn.JPG|thumb|A depiction of the imprisonment of [[Charles, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], in the [[Tower of London]] from a 15th-century manuscript.]]\n\nThe new Norman regime established new fortresses within the city to dominate the native population. By far the most important of these was the [[Tower of London]] at the eastern end of the city, where the initial timber fortification was rapidly replaced by the construction of the first stone castle in England. The smaller forts of [[Baynard's Castle]] and [[Montfichet's Castle]] were also established along the waterfront. King William also granted a [[charter]] in 1067 confirming the city's existing rights, privileges and laws. London was a centre of England's nascent [[History of the Jews in England (1066\u20131290)|Jewish population]], the first of whom arrived in about 1070.<ref>Jacobs, Joseph. TITLE.

This bridge would last for 600 years, and remained the only bridge across the [[River Thames]] until 1739.\n\nViolence against Jews took place in 1190, after it was rumoured that the new King had ordered their massacre after they had presented themselves at his coronation.<ref name=Jacobs>{{cite web|last1=Jacobs|first1=Joseph|title=England|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/5764-england|website=[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]|publisher=JewishEncyclopedia.com|year=1906}}</ref>\n\nIn 1216, during the [[First Barons' War]] London was occupied by [[Louis VIII of France|Prince Louis of France]], who had been called in by the baronial rebels against [[John of England|King John]] and was acclaimed as King of England in [[Old St. Paul's Cathedral|St Paul's Cathedral]]. However, following John's death in 1217 Louis's supporters reverted to their [[Plantagenet]] allegiance, rallying round John's son [[Henry III of England|Henry III]], and Louis was forced to withdraw from England.\n\nIn 1224, after an accusation of [[ritual murder]], the Jewish community was subjected to a steep punitive levy. Then in 1232, Henry III confiscated the principal [[synagogue]] of the London Jewish community because he claimed their chanting was audible in a neighboring church.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Jewish Community of London |url=https://dbs.bh.org.il/place/london-england |publisher=[[The Museum of the Jewish People at Beit Hatfutsot]] |accessdate=2 July 2018}}</ref> In 1264, during the [[Second Barons' War]], [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]]'s rebels occupied London and killed 500 Jews while attempting to seize records of debts.<ref name=Mundill2010>{{Citation |publisher = Continuum |ol = 24816680M |isbn = 9781847251862 |publication-place = London |title = The King's Jews |url = https://archive.org/details/kingsjewsmoneyma00mund |author = Robin R.

They left for France, Holland and further afield; their property was seized, and many suffered robbery and murder as they departed.<ref name=Jacobs/>\n\nOver the following centuries, London would shake off the heavy French cultural and linguistic influence which had been there since the times of the Norman conquest. The city would figure heavily in the development of [[Early Modern English]].\n[[File:Map of London, 1300.svg|thumb|300px|London {{Circa|1300}}]]\n\nDuring the [[Peasants' Revolt]] of 1381, London was invaded by rebels led by [[Wat Tyler]]. A group of peasants stormed the [[Tower of London]] and executed the [[Lord Chancellor]], Archbishop [[Simon Sudbury]], and the [[Lord Treasurer]]. The peasants looted the city and set fire to numerous buildings. Tyler was stabbed to death by the Lord Mayor [[William Walworth]] in a confrontation at [[Smithfield, London|Smithfield]] and the revolt collapsed.\n\nTrade increased steadily during the Middle Ages, and London grew rapidly as a result. In 1100, London's population was somewhat more than 15,000. By 1300, it had grown to roughly 80,000. London lost at least half of its population during the [[Black Death]] in the mid-14th century, but its economic and political importance stimulated a rapid recovery despite further epidemics. Trade in London was organised into various [[guild]]s, which effectively controlled the city, and elected the [[Lord Mayor of the City of London]].\n\nMedieval London was made up of narrow and twisting streets, and most of the buildings were made from combustible materials such as timber and straw, which made fire a constant threat, while sanitation in cities was of low-quality.\n\n==Modern history==\n\n===Tudor London (1485\u20131603)===\n{{main|Tudor London}}\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n!colspan=3|Wyngaerde's \"[[Panorama of London]] in 1543\"\n|-\n|[[File:Panorama of London in 1543 Wyngaerde Section 1.jpg|250px|Section 1]]\n|[[File:Panorama of London in 1543 Wyngaerde Section 2.jpg|250px|Section 2]]\n|[[File:Panorama of London in 1543 Wyngaerde Section 3.jpg|250px|Section 3]]\n|}\n\n[[File:London - John Norden's map of 1593.jpg|thumb|300px|[[John Norden]]'s map of London in 1593.

It existed until 1853, when the Hanseatic cities of [[L\u00fcbeck]], [[Bremen]] and [[Hamburg]] sold the property to [[South Eastern Railway, UK|South Eastern Railway]].<ref name=EB>{{1911|wstitle=Steelyard, Merchants of the}}</ref> [[Woollen]] cloth was shipped undyed and undressed from 14th/15th century London to the nearby shores of the [[Low Countries]], where it was considered indispensable.<ref>J.

CUP Archive</ref>\n\nDuring the [[English Reformation|Reformation]], London was the principal early centre of [[Protestantism]] in England. Its close commercial connections with the Protestant heartlands in northern continental Europe, large foreign mercantile communities, disproportionately large number of literate inhabitants and role as the centre of the English print trade all contributed to the spread of the new ideas of religious reform. Before the Reformation, more than half of the area of London was the property of [[monasteries]], [[nunnery|nunneries]] and other religious houses.<ref name=pevsner>[[Nikolaus Pevsner]], ''London I: The Cities of London and Westminster'' rev. edition,1962, Introduction p 48.</ref>\n\n[[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]'s \"[[Dissolution of the Monasteries]]\" had a profound effect on the city as nearly all of this property changed hands. The process started in the mid 1530s, and by 1538 most of the larger monastic houses had been abolished. Holy Trinity Aldgate went to [[John Tuchet, 8th Baron Audley|Lord Audley]], and the [[William Paulet, 1st Marquess of Winchester|Marquess of Winchester]] built himself a house in part of its precincts. The [[London Charterhouse|Charterhouse]] went to Lord North, Blackfriars to [[W:George Brooke, 9th Baron Cobham|Lord Cobham]], the leper hospital of St Giles to Lord Dudley, while the king took for himself the leper hospital of St James, which was rebuilt as [[St James's Palace]].<ref name=\"pevsner\"/>\n\nThe period saw London rapidly rising in importance among Europe's commercial centres. Trade expanded beyond Western Europe to Russia, the Levant, and the Americas. This was the period of [[mercantilism]] and monopoly trading companies such as the [[Muscovy Company]] (1555) and the [[British East India Company]] (1600) were established in London by Royal Charter. The latter, which ultimately came to rule India, was one of the key institutions in London, and in Britain as a whole, for two and a half centuries. Immigrants arrived in London not just from all over England and Wales, but from abroad as well, for example Huguenots from France; the population rose from an estimated 50,000 in 1530 to about 225,000 in 1605.<ref name=pevsner/> The growth of the population and wealth of London was fuelled by a vast expansion in the use of coastal shipping.\n\nThe late 16th and early 17th century saw the great flourishing of drama in London whose preeminent figure was [[William Shakespeare]]. During the mostly calm later years of Elizabeth's reign, some of her courtiers and some of the wealthier citizens of London built themselves country residences in [[Middlesex]], [[Essex]] and [[Surrey]]. This was an early stirring of the villa movement, the taste for residences which were neither of the city nor on an agricultural estate, but at the time of Elizabeth's death in 1603, London was still very compact.\n\n[[File:Civitas Londinium or The Agas Map of London.jpg|thumb|600px|centre|The [[Woodcut map of London|\"Woodcut\" map of London]], formally titled ''Civitas Londinum'' ({{Circa|1561}})]]\n\nXenophobia was rampant in London, and increased after the 1580s. Many immigrants became disillusioned by routine threats of violence and molestation, attempts at expulsion of foreigners, and the great difficulty in acquiring English citizenship. Dutch cities proved more hospitable, and many left London permanently.<ref>Bich Luu Lien, \"Taking the Bread Out of Our Mouths: Xenophobia in Early Modern London,\" ''Immigrants and Minorities,'' July 2000, Vol. 19 Issue 2, pp 1-22</ref> Foreigners are estimated to have made up 4,000 of the 100,000 residents of London by 1600, many being Dutch and German workers and traders.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/60417612|title=Bloody foreigners : the story of immigration to Britain|last=Winder|first=Robert|publisher=Abacus|year=2005|isbn=9780349115665|location=London|pages=|oclc=60417612|quote=Most of the foreigners who came this way were ambitious and knowledgeable.

In the opening years of that century the immediate environs of the City, with the principal exception of the aristocratic residences in the direction of Westminster, were still considered not conducive to health. Immediately to the north was [[Moorfields]], which had recently been drained and laid out in walks, but it was frequented by beggars and travellers, who crossed it in order to get into London. Adjoining Moorfields were [[Finsbury]] Fields, a favourite practising ground for the archers, [[Mile End]], then a common on the Great Eastern Road and famous as a rendezvous for the troops.\n\nThe preparations for [[James I of England|King James I]] becoming king were interrupted by a severe plague epidemic, which may have killed over thirty thousand people. The [[Lord Mayor's Show]], which had been discontinued for some years, was revived by order of the king in 1609. The dissolved monastery of the [[London Charterhouse|Charterhouse]], which had been bought and sold by the courtiers several times, was purchased by [[Thomas Sutton]] for \u00a313,000. The new hospital, chapel, and schoolhouse were begun in 1611. [[Charterhouse School]] was to be one of the principal [[public school (England)|public schools]] in London until it moved to Surrey in Victorian times, and the site is still used as a [[Barts and The London, Queen Mary's School of Medicine and Dentistry|medical school]].<ref>Sheila Hannah Williams, ''The Lord Mayor's Show in Tudor and Stuart Times'' (1959).</ref>\n\nThe general meeting-place of Londoners in the day-time was the nave of [[Old St. Paul's Cathedral]]. Merchants conducted business in the aisles, and used the font as a counter upon which to make their payments; lawyers received clients at their particular pillars; and the unemployed looked for work. St Paul's Churchyard was the centre of the book trade and [[Fleet Street]] was a centre of public entertainment. Under James I the theatre, which established itself so firmly in the latter years of Elizabeth, grew further in popularity. The performances at the public theatres were complemented by elaborate [[masques]] at the royal court and at the inns of court.<ref>Michael Berlin,  \"Civic ceremony in early modern London.\" ''Urban History'' 13 (1986): 15-27.. \"Civic ceremony in early modern London.\" ''Urban History'' (1986) 13#1 pp: 15-27.</ref>\n\n[[Charles I of England|Charles I]] acceded to the throne in 1625. During his reign, aristocrats began to inhabit the [[West End of London|West End]] in large numbers. In addition to those who had specific business at court, increasing numbers of country landowners and their families lived in London for part of the year simply for the social life. This was the beginning of the \"London season\". [[Lincoln's Inn Fields]] was built about 1629.<ref>Judith Milhous, ''Thomas Betterton and the management of Lincoln's Inn Fields, 1695\u20131708'' (Southern Illinois University Press, 1979)</ref> The piazza of [[Covent Garden]], designed by England's first classically trained architect [[Inigo Jones]] followed in about 1632.

In August of the same year the King raised his banner at [[Nottingham]], and during the [[English Civil War]] London took the side of the parliament. Initially the king had the upper hand in military terms and in November he won the [[Battle of Brentford (1642)|Battle of Brentford]] a few miles to the west of London. The City organised a new makeshift army and Charles hesitated and retreated. Subsequently, an extensive system of fortifications was built to protect London from a renewed attack by the Royalists. This comprised a strong earthen rampart, enhanced with bastions and redoubts. It was well beyond the City walls and encompassed the whole urban area, including Westminster and Southwark. London was not seriously threatened by the royalists again, and the financial resources of the City made an important contribution to the parliamentarians' victory in the war.\n\nThe unsanitary and overcrowded City of London has suffered from the numerous outbreaks of the plague many times over the centuries, but in Britain it is the last major outbreak which is remembered as the \"[[Great Plague of London|Great Plague]]\" It occurred in 1665 and 1666 and killed around 60,000 people, which was one fifth of the population. [[Samuel Pepys]] chronicled the epidemic in his diary. On 4 September 1665 he wrote \"I have stayed in the city till above 7400 died in one week, and of them about 6000 of the plague, and little noise heard day or night but tolling of bells.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Peter Hampson Ditchfield|title=Memorials of Old London|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XW4LAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA76|year=1908|page=76}}</ref><ref>Walter George Bell, ''The Great Plague in London'' (Bracken Books, 1995).</ref>\n\n====Great Fire of London (1666)====\n{{main|Great Fire of London}}\nThe Great Plague was immediately followed by another catastrophe, albeit one which helped to put an end to the plague. On the Sunday, 2 September 1666 the [[Great Fire of London]] broke out at one o'clock in the morning at a bakery in [[Pudding Lane]] in the southern part of the City. Fanned by an eastern wind the fire spread, and efforts to arrest it by pulling down houses to make firebreaks were disorganised to begin with. On Tuesday night the wind fell somewhat, and on Wednesday the fire slackened. On Thursday it was extinguished, but on the evening of that day the flames again burst forth at the Temple. Some houses were at once blown up by gunpowder, and thus the fire was finally mastered. [[The Monument]] was built to commemorate the fire: for over a century and a half it bore an inscription attributing the conflagration to a ''\"popish frenzy\"''.<ref>Peter Ackroyd, ''The great fire of London'' (U of Chicago Press, 1988)</ref>\n\n[[File:John Evelyn's plan for the rebuilding of London after the Great Fire.JPG|thumb|350px|[[John Evelyn]]'s plan for the rebuilding of London after the Great Fire]]\nThe fire destroyed about 60% of the City, including [[Old St Paul's Cathedral]], 87 parish churches, 44 [[livery company]] halls and the [[Royal Exchange, London|Royal Exchange]]. However, the number of lives lost was surprisingly small; it is believed to have been 16 at most. Within a few days of the fire, three plans were presented to the king for the rebuilding of the city, by [[Christopher Wren]], [[John Evelyn]] and [[Robert Hooke]].<ref>Thomas Fiddian Reddaway, ''The rebuilding of London after the great fire'' (Arnold, 1951).</ref>\n\nWren proposed to build main thoroughfares north and south, and east and west, to insulate all the churches in conspicuous positions, to form the most public places into large piazzas, to unite the halls of the 12 chief livery companies into one regular square annexed to the [[Guildhall, London|Guildhall]], and to make a fine quay on the bank of the river from [[Blackfriars, London|Blackfriars]] to the [[Tower of London]]. Wren wished to build the new streets straight and in three standard widths of thirty, sixty and ninety feet. Evelyn's plan differed from Wren's chiefly in proposing a street from the church of [[St Dunstan's in the East]] to the St Paul's, and in having no quay or terrace along the river. These plans were not implemented, and the rebuilt city generally followed the streetplan of the old one, and most of it has survived into the 21st century.\n\n[[File:London - Richard Blome's map of 1673.JPG|thumb|350px|[[Richard Blome]]'s map of London (1673). The development of the West End had recently begun to accelerate.]]\n\nNonetheless, the new City was different from the old one. Many aristocratic residents never returned, preferring to take new houses in the West End, where fashionable new districts such as [[St. James's]] were built close to the main royal residence, which was [[Whitehall Palace]] until it was destroyed by fire in the 1690s, and thereafter [[St. James's Palace]]. The rural lane of [[Piccadilly]] sprouted courtiers mansions such as [[Burlington House]]. Thus the separation between the middle class mercantile City of London, and the aristocratic world of the court in [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]] became complete.<ref>Timothy Baker, ''London: rebuilding the city after the great fire'' (Phillimore & Company, 2000)</ref>\n\nIn the City itself there was a move from wooden buildings to stone and brick construction to reduce the risk of fire. Parliament's [[Rebuilding of London Act 1666]] stated ''\"building with brick [is] not only more comely and durable, but also more safe against future perils of fire\"''. From then on only doorcases, window-frames and shop fronts were allowed to be made of wood.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Thomas Robert Way|author2=Henry Benjamin Wheatley|title=Reliques of Old London|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vjZAAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA10|year=1896|page=10}}</ref>\n\nChristopher Wren's plan for a new model London came to nothing, but he was appointed to rebuild the ruined parish churches and to replace [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. His domed [[baroque]] cathedral was the primary symbol of London for at least a century and a half. As city surveyor, [[Robert Hooke]] oversaw the reconstruction of the City's houses. The [[East End]], that is the area immediately to the east of the city walls, also became heavily populated in the decades after the Great Fire. London's docks began to extend downstream, attracting many working people who worked on the docks themselves and in the processing and distributive trades. These people lived in [[Whitechapel]], [[Wapping]], [[Stepney]] and [[Limehouse]], generally in slum conditions.<ref>Michael Alan Ralph Cooper, ''A More Beautiful City: Robert Hooke and the Rebuilding of London After the Great Fire'' (Sutton Pub Limited, 2003)</ref>\n\nIn the winter of 1683\u20131684, a [[Thames frost fairs|frost fair]] was held on the Thames. The frost, which began about seven weeks before Christmas and continued for six weeks after, was the greatest on record. The [[Revocation of the Edict of Nantes]] in 1685 led to a large migration on [[Huguenots]] to London. They established a silk industry at [[Spitalfields]].<ref>{{cite book|author=William Andrews|title=Famous Frosts and Frost Fairs in Great Britain: Chronicled from the Earliest to the Present Time|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y70TAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA16|year=1887|publisher=G. Redway|pages=16\u201317}}</ref>\n\nAt this time the [[Bank of England]] was founded, and the British East India Company was expanding its influence. [[Lloyd's of London]] also began to operate in the late 17th century. In 1700, London handled 80% of England's imports, 69% of its exports and 86% of its re-exports. Many of the goods were luxuries from the Americas and Asia such as silk, sugar, tea and tobacco. The last figure emphasises London's role as an [[entrepot]]: while it had many craftsmen in the 17th century, and would later acquire some large factories, its economic prominence was never based primarily on industry. Instead it was a great trading and redistribution centre. Goods were brought to London by England's increasingly dominant merchant navy, not only to satisfy domestic demand, but also for re-export throughout Europe and beyond.<ref>{{cite book|author=Miles Ogborn|title=Spaces of Modernity: London's Geographies, 1680-1780|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tCp_X-AUQ6MC&pg=PA206|year=1998|publisher=Guilford Press|page=206}}</ref>\n\n[[William III of England|William III]], a Dutchman, cared little for London, the smoke of which gave him asthma, and after the first fire at Whitehall Palace (1691) he purchased Nottingham House and transformed it into [[Kensington Palace]]. [[Kensington]] was then an insignificant village, but the arrival of the court soon caused it to grow in importance. The palace was rarely favoured by future monarchs, but its construction was another step in the expansion of the bounds of London. During the same reign [[Greenwich Hospital (London)|Greenwich Hospital]], then well outside the boundary of London, but now comfortably inside it, was begun; it was the naval complement to the [[Chelsea Hospital]] for former soldiers, which had been founded in 1681. During the reign of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] an act was passed authorising the building of 50 new churches to serve the greatly increased population living outside the boundaries of the City of London.<ref>Jason R.

Bowles.JPG|thumb|250px|A view of London from the east in 1751]]\n{{main|18th-century London}}\nThe 18th century was a period of rapid growth for London, reflecting an increasing national population, the early stirrings of the [[Industrial Revolution]], and London's role at the centre of the evolving [[British Empire]].\n\nIn 1707, an [[Acts of Union 1707|Act of Union]] was passed merging the Scottish and the English Parliaments, thus establishing the Kingdom of Great Britain. A year later, in 1708 Christopher Wren's masterpiece, [[St Paul's Cathedral]] was completed on his birthday. However, the first service had been held on 2 December 1697; more than 10 years earlier. This Cathedral replaced the original St. Paul's which had been completely destroyed in the [[Great Fire of London]]. This building is considered one of the finest in Britain and a fine example of [[Baroque architecture]].\n\n[[File:StPaulsClockTower.jpg|thumb|The Clock Tower of Wren's [[St Paul's Cathedral]]]]\n\nMany tradesmen from different countries came to London to trade goods and merchandise. Also, more immigrants moved to London making the population greater. More people also moved to London for work and for business making London an altogether bigger and busier city. [[Great Britain in the Seven Years' War|Britain's victory in the Seven Years' War]] increased the country's international standing and opened large new markets to British trade, further boosting London's prosperity.\n\nDuring the Georgian period London spread beyond its traditional limits at an accelerating pace. This is shown in a series of detailed maps, particularly [[John Rocque]]'s 1741\u201345 map ''(see below)'' and his [[John Rocque's Map of London, 1746|1746 Map of London]]. New districts such as [[Mayfair]] were built for the rich in the West End, new bridges over the Thames encouraged an acceleration of development in [[South London]] and in the East End, the [[Port of London]] expanded downstream from the City. During this period was also the uprising of the American colonies. In 1780, the [[Tower of London]] held its only American prisoner, former President of the [[Continental Congress]], [[Henry Laurens]]. In 1779, he was the Congress's representative of Holland, and got the country's support for the Revolution. On his return voyage back to America, the Royal Navy captured him and charged him with treason after finding evidence of a reason of war between Great Britain and the Netherlands. He was released from the Tower on 21 December 1781 in exchange for General [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Lord Cornwallis]].\n\nIn 1762, [[George III of Great Britain|George III]] acquired [[Buckingham Palace]] (then called Buckingham House) from the Duke of Buckingham. It was enlarged over the next 75 years by architects such as John Nash.\n[[File:Buckingham House 1710.jpeg|thumb|250px|[[Buckingham Palace]] as it appeared in the 17th century]]\n[[File:Buckingham Palace engraved by J.Woods after Hablot Browne & R.Garland publ 1837 edited.jpg|thumb|250px|Buckingham Palace in 1837, enlarged by [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]]]]\n[[English coffeehouses in the 17th and 18th centuries|A phenomenon of the era was the coffeehouse]], which became a popular place to debate ideas. Growing literacy and the development of the [[printing press]] meant that news became widely available. [[Fleet Street]] became the centre of the embryonic national press during the century.\n\n18th-century London was dogged by crime.  The [[Bow Street Runners]] were established in 1750 as a professional police force. Penalties for crime were harsh, with the death penalty being applied for fairly minor crimes. Public [[hanging]]s were common in London, and were popular public events.\n\nIn 1780, London was rocked by the [[Gordon Riots]], an uprising by [[Protestant]]s against [[Roman Catholic]] emancipation led by [[Lord George Gordon]]. Severe damage was caused to Catholic churches and homes, and 285 rioters were killed.\n\nIn the year 1787, freed slaves from London, America, and many of Britain's colonies founded [[Freetown]] in modern-day Sierra Leone.\n\nUp until 1750, [[London Bridge]] was the only crossing over the [[Thames]], but in that year [[Westminster Bridge]] was opened and, for the first time in history, London Bridge, in a sense, had a rival. In 1798, Frankfurt banker [[Nathan Mayer Rothschild]] arrived in London and set up a banking house in the city, with a large sum of money given to him by his father, [[Amschel Mayer Rothschild]]. The Rothschilds also had banks in Paris and Vienna. The bank financed numerous large-scale projects, especially regarding railways around the world and the Suez Canal.<ref>Niall Ferguson, ''The House of Rothschild'' (2 vol. 1998) 2:171-75, 297-304</ref>\n\nThe 18th century saw the breakaway of the American colonies and many other unfortunate events in London, but also great change and Enlightenment. This all led into the beginning of modern times, the 19th century.\n\n[[File:Rocque's Map of London 1741-5.jpg|thumb|centre|500px|A detailed copy of [[John Rocque]]'s Map of London, 1741-5.]]\n\n===19th century===\n{{main|19th-century London}}\n[[File:London engraved by J. & C. Walker in 1845 from a map by R Creighton.JPG|thumb|350px|London as engraved by J. & C. Walker in 1845 from a map by R Creighton. Many districts in the West End were fully developed, and the East End also extended well beyond the eastern fringe of the City of London. There were now several bridges over the Thames, allowing the rapid development of [[South London]].]]\nDuring the 19th century, London was transformed into the world's largest city and capital of the British Empire. Its population expanded from 1&nbsp;million in 1800 to 6.7&nbsp;million a century later. During this period, London became a global political, financial, and trading capital. In this position, it was largely unrivalled until the latter part of the century, when [[Paris]] and [[New York City|New York]] began to threaten its dominance.\n\nWhile the city grew wealthy as Britain's holdings expanded, 19th-century London was also a city of poverty, where millions lived in overcrowded and unsanitary [[slum]]s. Life for the poor was immortalised by [[Charles Dickens]] in such novels as [[Oliver Twist]]  In 1810, after the death of [[Sir Francis Baring]] and Abraham Goldsmid, Rothschild emerges as the major banker in London.\n\nIn 1829, the then Home Secretary (and future prime minister) [[Robert Peel]] established the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]] as a police force covering the entire urban area. The force gained the nickname of \"bobbies\" or \"peelers\" named after Robert Peel.\n\n19th-century London was transformed by the coming of the railways. A new network of metropolitan railways allowed for the development of suburbs in neighbouring counties from which middle-class and wealthy people could commute to the centre. While this spurred the massive outward growth of the city, the growth of greater London also exacerbated the class divide, as the wealthier classes emigrated to the suburbs, leaving the poor to inhabit the inner city areas.\n\nThe first railway to be built in London was a line from [[London Bridge]] to [[Greenwich]], which opened in 1836. This was soon followed by the opening of great rail termini which eventually linked London to every corner of Great Britain, including [[Euston railway station|Euston station]] (1837), [[Paddington station]] (1838), [[Fenchurch Street station]] (1841), [[London Waterloo railway station|Waterloo station]] (1848), [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross station]] (1850), and [[St Pancras station]] (1863). From 1863, the first lines of the [[London Underground]] were constructed.\n\nThe urbanised area continued to grow rapidly, spreading into [[Islington]], [[Paddington]], [[Belgravia]], [[Holborn]], [[Finsbury]], [[Shoreditch]], [[Southwark]] and [[Lambeth]]. Towards the middle of the century, London's antiquated local government system, consisting of ancient parishes and [[vestry|vestries]], struggled to cope with the rapid growth in population. In 1855, the [[Metropolitan Board of Works]] (MBW) was created to provide London with adequate infrastructure to cope with its growth. One of its first tasks was addressing London's sanitation problems. At the time, raw [[sewage]] was pumped straight into the [[River Thames]]. This culminated in [[The Great Stink]] of 1858.<ref>Lee Jackson, ''Dirty Old London: The Victorian Fight Against Filth'' (2014)</ref> Parliament finally gave consent for the MBW to construct a large system of [[sanitary sewer|sewers]]. The engineer put in charge of building the new system was [[Joseph Bazalgette]]. In what was one of the largest [[civil engineering]] projects of the 19th century, he oversaw construction of over 2100&nbsp;km of tunnels and pipes under London to take away sewage and provide clean drinking water. When the [[London sewerage system]] was completed, the death toll in London dropped dramatically, and epidemics of [[cholera]] and other diseases were curtailed. Bazalgette's system is still in use today.<ref>Stephen Halliday, ''The great stink of London: Sir Joseph Bazalgette and the cleansing of the Victorian metropolis'' (The History Press, 2013)</ref>\n\nOne of the most famous events of 19th-century London was the [[Great Exhibition of 1851]]. Held at [[The Crystal Palace]], the fair attracted 6&nbsp;million visitors from across the world and displayed Britain at the height of its Imperial dominance.<ref>Jeffrey A., Auerbach, ed. ''The Great Exhibition of 1851: a nation on display'' (Yale University Press, 1999)</ref>\n[[File:Westminster.JPG|thumb|The Houses of Parliament from Westminster Bridge in the early 1890s]]\nAs the capital of a massive empire, London became a magnet for immigrants from the colonies and poorer parts of Europe. A large Irish population settled in the city during the Victorian period, with many of the newcomers refugees from the [[Great Irish Famine|Great Famine (1845\u20131849)]]. At one point, Catholic Irish made up about 20% of London's population; they typically lived in overcrowded slums.<ref>Lynn Hollen Lees, ''Exiles of Erin: Irish Migrants in Victorian London'' (Manchester University Press, 1979)</ref> London also became home to [[History of the Jews in England|a sizable Jewish community]], which was notable for its entrepreneurship in the clothing trade and merchandising.<ref>Andrew Godley, ''Jewish Immigrant Entrepreneurship in New York and London, 1880\u20131914'' (2001)</ref>\n\nIn 1888, the new [[County of London]] was established, administered by the [[London County Council]]. This was the first elected London-wide administrative body, replacing the earlier Metropolitan Board of Works, which had been made up of appointees. The County of London covered broadly what was then the full extent of the London conurbation, although the conurbation later outgrew the boundaries of the county. In 1900, the county was sub-divided into 28 [[Metropolitan boroughs of the County of London|metropolitan boroughs]], which formed a more local tier of administration than the county council.\n\nMany famous buildings and landmarks of London were constructed during the 19th century including:\n* [[Trafalgar Square]]\n* [[Clock Tower, Palace of Westminster|Big Ben]] and the [[Palace of Westminster|Houses of Parliament]]\n* The [[Royal Albert Hall]]\n* The [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]\n* [[Tower Bridge]]\n\n===20th century===\n====1900 to 1939====<!-- This section is linked from [[London 1900-1939]] -->\n{{main|History of London 1900\u20131939}}\n[[File:Cheapside 1909.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cheapside]] pictured in 1909, with the church of [[St Mary-le-Bow]] in the background.]]\nLondon entered the 20th century at the height of its influence as the capital of one of the largest empires in history, but the new century was to bring many challenges.\n\nLondon's population continued to grow rapidly in the early decades of the century, and [[public transport]] was greatly expanded. A large tram network was constructed by the London County Council, through the [[London County Council Tramways|LCC Tramways]]; the first [[bus|motorbus]] service began in the 1900s. Improvements to London's overground and underground rail network, including large scale electrification were progressively carried out.\n\nDuring World War I, London experienced its first bombing raids carried out by German [[zeppelin]] [[airship]]s; these killed around 700 people and caused great terror, but were merely a foretaste of what was to come. The city of London would experience many more terrors as a result of both World Wars. The largest explosion in London occurred during World War I: the [[Silvertown explosion]], when a munitions factory containing 50 tons of [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]] exploded, killing 73 and injuring 400.\n\nThe [[Interwar|period between the two World Wars]] saw London's geographical extent growing more quickly than ever before or since. A preference for lower density suburban housing, typically [[semi-detached]], by Londoners seeking a more \"rural\" lifestyle, superseded Londoners' old predilection for [[terraced house]]s. This was facilitated not only by a continuing expansion of the rail network, including trams and the Underground, but also by slowly widening car ownership. London's suburbs expanded outside the boundaries of the County of London, into the neighbouring counties of [[Essex]], [[Hertfordshire]], [[Kent]], [[Middlesex]] and [[Surrey]].\n\nLike the rest of the country, London suffered severe unemployment during the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s. In the [[East End of London|East End]] during the 1930s, politically extreme parties of both right and left flourished. The [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] and the [[British Union of Fascists]] both gained serious support. Clashes between right and left culminated in the [[Battle of Cable Street]] in 1936. The population of London reached an all-time peak of 8.6&nbsp;million in 1939.\n\nLarge numbers of Jewish immigrants fleeing from [[Nazi Germany]] settled in London during the 1930s, mostly in the [[East End of London|East End]].\n\nLabour Party politician [[Herbert Morrison]] was a dominant figure in local government in the 1920s and 1930s. He became mayor of Hackney and a member of the London County Council in 1922, and for a while was Minister of Transport in Ramsay MacDonald's cabinet. When Labour gained power in London in 1934, Morrison unified the bus, tram and trolleybus services with the Underground, by the creation of the [[London Passenger Transport Board]] (known as London Transport) in 1933., He led the effort to finance and build the new [[Waterloo Bridge]]. He designed the [[Metropolitan Green Belt]] around the suburbs and worked to clear slums, build schools, and reform public assistance.<ref>George W. Jones and Bernard Donoughue, ''Herbert Morrison: Portrait of a Politician'' (1973) pp 189-210.</ref>\n\n====In World War II====\n{{main|London in World War II|The Blitz}}\n[[File:Blitzaftermath.jpg|thumb|250px|Firefighters putting out flames after an air raid during [[The Blitz]], 1941.]]\n\nDuring [[World War II]], London, as many other British cities, suffered severe damage, being bombed extensively by the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' as a part of [[The Blitz]]. Prior to the bombing, hundreds of thousands of children in London were evacuated to the countryside to avoid the bombing. Civilians took shelter from the air raids in underground stations.\n\nThe heaviest bombing took place during [[The Blitz]] between 7 September 1940 and 10 May 1941. During this period, London was subjected to 71 separate raids receiving over 18,000 tonnes of high explosive. One raid in December 1940, which became known as the [[Second Great Fire of London]], saw a [[firestorm]] engulf much of the [[City of London]] and destroy many historic buildings. [[St Paul's Cathedral]], however, remained unscathed; a photograph showing the Cathedral shrouded in smoke became a famous image of the war.<ref>Maureen Hill, ''The Blitz''. Marks and Spencer, 2002</ref>\n\nHaving failed to defeat Britain, Hitler turned his attention to the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern front]] and regular bombing raids ceased. They began again, but on a smaller scale with the \"[[Operation Steinbock|Little Blitz]]\" in early 1944. Towards the end of the war, during 1944/45 London again came under heavy attack by pilotless [[V-1 flying bomb]]s and [[V-2 rocket]]s, which were fired from Nazi occupied Europe. These attacks only came to an end when their launch sites were captured by advancing Allied forces.\n\nLondon suffered severe damage and heavy casualties, the worst hit part being the [[Port of London|Docklands]] area. By the war's end, just under 30,000 Londoners had been killed by the bombing, and over 50,000 seriously injured,<ref>[http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/homefront/arp/arp4.html Air Raid Precautions] homefront website</ref> tens of thousands of buildings were destroyed, and hundreds of thousands of people were made homeless.<ref>Amy Helen Bell, ''London was ours: Diaries and memoirs of the London Blitz'' (IB Tauris, 2011)</ref>\n\n====1945\u20132000====<!--This section is linked from [[Modern London (from 1945)]]-->\n{{Anchor|London 1945\u20132000}}\n[[File:London , Piccadilly Circus looking up Shaftsbury Ave , circa 1949 ,Kodachrome by Chalmers Butterfield.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Shaftesbury Avenue]], {{Circa|1949}}]]\nThree years after the war, the [[1948 Summer Olympics]] were held at the original [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]], at a time when the city had barely recovered from the war. London's rebuilding was slow to begin. However, in 1951 the [[Festival of Britain]] was held, which marked an increasing mood of optimism and forward looking.\n\nIn the immediate postwar years housing was a major issue in London, due to the large amount of housing which had been destroyed in the war. The authorities decided upon high-rise [[tower block|blocks of flats]] as the answer to housing shortages. During the 1950s and 1960s the skyline of London altered dramatically as tower blocks were erected, although these later proved unpopular. In a bid to reduce the number of people living in overcrowded housing, a policy was introduced of encouraging people to move into newly built [[New town#United Kingdom|new towns]] surrounding London.<ref>Richard Quentin Donald Hornsey, ''The Spiv and the Architect: Unruly Life in Postwar London'' (U of Minnesota Press, 2010).</ref>\n\nThrough the 19th and in the early half of the 20th century, Londoners used coal for heating their homes, which produced large amounts of smoke. In combination with climatic conditions this often caused a characteristic smog, and London became known for its typical \"London Fog\", also known as \"Pea Soupers\". London was sometimes referred to as \"The Smoke\" because of this. In 1952, this culminated in the disastrous [[Great Smog of 1952]] which lasted for five days and killed over 4,000 people. In response to this, the [[Clean Air Act 1956]] was passed, mandating the creating of \"smokeless zones\" where the use of \"smokeless\" fuels was required (this was at a time when most households still used open fires); the Act was effective.<ref>Devra L. Davis, \"A look back at the London smog of 1952 and the half century since.\" ''Environmental health perspectives'' 110.12 (2002): A734.</ref>\n\n[[File:Londons Carnaby Street, 1966.jpg|thumb|250px|Young people in [[Carnaby Street]] in the 1960s]]\nStarting in the mid-1960s, and partly as a result of the success of such UK musicians as [[the Beatles]] and [[The Rolling Stones]], London became a centre for the worldwide [[youth culture]], exemplified by the [[Swinging London]] subculture which made [[Carnaby Street]] a household name of youth fashion around the world. London's role as a trendsetter for youth fashion was revived strongly in the 1980s during the [[New wave music|new wave]] and [[Punk rock|punk]] eras. In the mid-1990s this was revived to some extent with the emergence of the [[Britpop]] era.\n\nFrom the 1950s onwards London became home to a large number of immigrants, largely from [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries such as [[Jamaica]], [[India]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Pakistan]], which dramatically changed the face of London, turning it into one of the most diverse cities in Europe. However, the integration of the new immigrants was not always easy. Racial tensions emerged in events such as the [[1981 Brixton riot|Brixton Riots]] in the early 1980s.<ref>Matt Cook, \"\u2018Gay Times\u2019: Identity, Locality, Memory, and the Brixton Squats in 1970's London.\" ''Twentieth Century British History'' (2013) 24#1 pp: 84-109.</ref>\n\nFrom the beginning of \"[[The Troubles]]\" in [[Northern Ireland]] in the early 1970s until the mid-1990s, London was subjected to repeated [[List of terrorist incidents in London|terrorist attacks]] by the [[Provisional IRA]].\n\nThe outward expansion of London was slowed by the war, and the introduction of the [[Metropolitan Green Belt]]. Due to this outward expansion, in 1965 the old [[County of London]] (which by now only covered part of the London conurbation) and the [[London County Council]] were abolished, and the much larger area of [[Greater London]] was established with a new [[Greater London Council]] (GLC) to administer it, along with 32 new [[London borough]]s.\n\nGreater London's population declined steadily in the decades after World War II, from an estimated peak of 8.6&nbsp;million in 1939 to around 6.8&nbsp;million in the 1980s. However, it then began to increase again in the late 1980s, encouraged by strong economic performance and an increasingly positive image.\n\nLondon's traditional status as a major port declined dramatically in the post-war decades as the old [[London Docklands|Docklands]] could not accommodate large modern container ships. The principal ports for London moved downstream to the ports of [[Port of Felixstowe|Felixstowe]] and [[Port of Tilbury|Tilbury]]. The docklands area had become largely derelict by the 1980s, but was redeveloped into flats and offices from the mid-1980s onwards. The [[Thames Barrier]] was completed in the 1980s to protect London against tidal surges from the [[North Sea]].\n\nIn the early 1980s political disputes between the GLC run by [[Ken Livingstone]] and the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government of [[Margaret Thatcher]] led to the GLC's abolition in 1986, with most of its powers relegated to the [[London borough]]s. This left London as the only large metropolis in the world without a central administration.\n\nIn 2000, London-wide government was restored, with the creation of the [[Greater London Authority]] (GLA) by [[Tony Blair]]'s government, covering the same area of Greater London. The new authority had similar powers to the old GLC, but was made up of a directly elected [[Mayor of London|Mayor]] and a [[London Assembly]]. The first election took place on 4 May, with [[Ken Livingstone]] comfortably regaining his previous post. London was recognised as one of the nine [[regions of England]]. In global perspective, it was emerging as a [[World city]] widely compared to New York and Tokyo.<ref>Greg Clark, ''The Making of a World City: London 1991 to 2021'' (John Wiley & Sons, 2014)</ref>\n\n===21st century===\n[[File:Skyscrapper Shard London.jpg|thumb|[[The Shard]], an icon of 21st century London]]\n\nAround the start of the 21st century, London hosted the much derided [[Millennium Dome]] at [[Greenwich]], to mark the new century. Other Millennium projects were more successful. One was the largest observation wheel in the world, the \"Millennium Wheel\", or the [[London Eye]], which was erected as a temporary structure, but soon became a fixture, and draws four million visitors a year. The [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]] also released a flood of funds for major enhancements to existing attractions, for example the roofing of the Great Court at the [[British Museum]].\n\nThe [[London Plan]], published by the [[Mayor of London]] in 2004, estimated that the population would reach 8.1&nbsp;million by 2016, and continue to rise thereafter. This was reflected in a move towards denser, more urban styles of building, including a greatly increased number of [[Tall buildings in London|tall buildings]], and proposals for major enhancements to the public transport network. However, funding for projects such as [[Crossrail]] remained a struggle.\n\nOn 6 July 2005 London won [[London 2012 Olympic bid|the right to host the 2012 Olympics and Paralympics]] making it the first city to host the modern games three times. However, celebrations were cut short the following day when the city was rocked by [[7 July 2005 London bombings|a series of terrorist attacks]]. More than 50 were killed and 750 injured in three bombings on [[London Underground]] trains and a fourth on a double decker bus near King's Cross.\n\nLondon was the starting point for [[2011 England riots|countrywide riots]] which occurred in August 2011, when thousands of people rioted in several city boroughs and in towns across England. In 2011, the population grew over 8 million people for the first time in decades. [[White British]] formed less than half of the population for [[Ethnic groups in London#2011 Census|the first time]].\n\nIn the public there was ambivalence leading-up to the Olympics,<ref>[http://travel.nytimes.com/2012/04/29/travel/a-profile-of-london-by-aa-gill.html My London, and Welcome to It] 27 April 2012</ref> though public sentiment changed strongly in their favour following a successful opening ceremony and when the anticipated organisational and transport problems never occurred.\n\n===Population===\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The calendar takes the form of an early [[Mesolithic]] monument containing a series of 12 pits which appear to help the observer track lunar months by mimicking the phases of the moon.

A form of writing known as [[cuneiform]] emerged among the Sumerians around 3500\u20133000 BC. Our knowledge of Sumerian astronomy is indirect, via the earliest Babylonian star catalogues dating from about 1200 BC. The fact that many star names appear in Sumerian suggests a continuity reaching into the Early Bronze Age. Astral theology, which gave planetary gods an important role in [[Mesopotamian mythology]] and [[Mesopotamian religion|religion]], began with the Sumerians. They also used a [[sexagesimal]] (base 60) place-value number system, which simplified the task of recording very large and very small numbers. The modern practice of dividing a circle into 360 [[degree (angle)|degrees]], or an hour into 60 minutes, began with the Sumerians. For more information, see the articles on [[Babylonian numerals]] and [[Babylonian mathematics|mathematics]].\n\nClassical sources frequently use the term [[wikt:Chaldean|Chaldean]]s for the astronomers of Mesopotamia, who were, in reality, priest-scribes specializing in [[astrology]] and other forms of [[divination]].\n\nThe first evidence of recognition that astronomical phenomena are periodic and of the application of mathematics to their prediction is Babylonian. Tablets dating back to the [[First Babylonian Dynasty|Old Babylonian period]] document the application of mathematics to the variation in the length of daylight over a solar year. Centuries of Babylonian observations of celestial phenomena are recorded in the series of [[cuneiform]] tablets known as the ''[[En\u016bma Anu Enlil]]''. The oldest significant astronomical text that we possess is Tablet 63 of the ''En\u016bma Anu Enlil'', the [[Venus tablet of Ammisaduqa|Venus tablet]] of [[Ammi-saduqa]], which lists the first and last visible risings of Venus over a period of about 21 years and is the earliest evidence that the phenomena of a planet were recognized as periodic. The [[MUL.APIN]], contains catalogues of stars and constellations as well as schemes for predicting [[heliacal rising]]s and the settings of the planets, lengths of daylight measured by a [[water clock]], [[gnomon]], shadows, and [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalations]]. The Babylonian GU text arranges stars in 'strings' that lie along declination circles and thus measure right-ascensions or time-intervals, and also employs the stars of the zenith, which are also separated by given right-ascensional differences.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Pingree|1998}}<br>{{Harvtxt|Rochberg|2004}}<br>{{Harvtxt|Evans|1998}}</ref>\n\nA significant increase in the quality and frequency of Babylonian observations appeared during the reign of [[Nabonassar]] (747\u2013733 BC). The systematic records of ominous phenomena in [[Babylonian astronomical diaries]] that began at this time allowed for the discovery of a repeating 18-year cycle of [[lunar eclipses]], for example. The Greek astronomer [[Ptolemy]] later used Nabonassar's reign to fix the beginning of an era, since he felt that the earliest usable observations began at this time.\n\nThe last stages in the development of Babylonian astronomy took place during the time of the [[Seleucid Empire]] (323\u201360 BC). In the 3rd century BC, astronomers began to use \"goal-year texts\" to predict the motions of the planets. These texts compiled records of past observations to find repeating occurrences of ominous phenomena for each planet. About the same time, or shortly afterwards, astronomers created mathematical models that allowed them to predict these phenomena directly, without consulting past records. A notable Babylonian astronomer from this time was [[Seleucus of Seleucia]], who was a supporter of the [[heliocentrism|heliocentric model]].\n\nBabylonian astronomy was the basis for much of what was done in [[Greek astronomy|Greek and Hellenistic astronomy]], in classical [[Indian astronomy]], in Sassanian Iran, in Byzantium, in Syria, in [[Islamic astronomy]], in Central Asia, and in Western Europe.<ref name=dp1998>{{Harvtxt|Pingree|1998}}</ref>\n\n===India===\n[[File:Jantar Mantar at Jaipur.jpg|thumb|Historical [[Jantar Mantar (Jaipur)|Jantar Mantar]] observatory in [[Jaipur]], India.]]\n{{Main|Indian astronomy}}\n{{Further|Jyotisha}}\n\nAstronomy in the Indian subcontinent dates back to the period of [[Indus Valley Civilization]] during 3rd millennium BCE, when it was used to create calendars.<ref name=\"Bely\">{{cite book|title=A Question and Answer Guide to Astronomy|page=197|author1=Pierre-Yves Bely |author2=Carol Christian |author3=Jean-Ren\u00e9 Roy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PbLPel3zRdEC&pg=PA197|year=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-18066-5}}</ref> As the Indus Valley civilization did not leave behind written documents, the oldest extant Indian astronomical text is the [[Vedanga Jyotisha]], dating from the [[Vedic period]].<ref name=Cosmic>{{cite book|last=Subbarayappa|first=B.

The first geometrical, three-dimensional models to explain the apparent motion of the planets were developed in the 4th century BC by [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]] and [[Callippus of Cyzicus]]. Their models were based on nested homocentric spheres centered upon the Earth. Their younger contemporary [[Heraclides Ponticus]] proposed that the Earth rotates around its axis.\n\nA different approach to celestial phenomena was taken by natural philosophers such as [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]]. They were less concerned with developing mathematical predictive models than with developing an explanation of the reasons for the motions of the Cosmos. In his ''Timaeus'', Plato described the universe as a spherical body divided into circles carrying the planets and governed according to harmonic intervals by a world soul.<ref>Plato, ''Timaeus,'' 33B-36D</ref> Aristotle, drawing on the mathematical model of Eudoxus, proposed that the universe was made of a complex system of concentric [[Celestial spheres|spheres]], whose circular motions combined to carry the planets around the earth.<ref>Aristotle, ''Metaphysics,'' 1072a18-1074a32</ref> This basic cosmological model prevailed, in various forms, until the 16th century.\n\nIn the 3rd century BC [[Aristarchus of Samos]] was the first to suggest a [[heliocentric]] system, although only fragmentary descriptions of his idea survive.<ref>Pedersen, ''Early Physics and Astronomy'', pp. 55\u20136</ref> [[Eratosthenes]], using the angles of shadows created at widely separated regions, estimated the circumference of the [[Earth]] with great accuracy.<ref>Pedersen, ''Early Physics and Astronomy'', pp. 45\u20137</ref>\n\nGreek geometrical astronomy developed away from the model of concentric spheres to employ more complex models in which an [[deferent|eccentric]] circle would carry around a smaller circle, called an [[epicycle]] which in turn carried around a planet. The first such model is attributed to [[Apollonius of Perga]] and further developments in it were carried out in the 2nd century BC by [[Hipparchus|Hipparchus of Nicea]]. Hipparchus made a number of other contributions, including the first measurement of [[precession]] and the compilation of the first star catalog in which he proposed our modern system of [[apparent magnitude]]s.\n\nThe [[Antikythera mechanism]], an [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] astronomical observational device for calculating the movements of the Sun and the Moon, possibly the planets, dates from about 150\u2013100 BC, and was the first ancestor of an astronomical [[computer]]. It was discovered in an ancient shipwreck off the Greek island of [[Antikythera]], between [[Kythera]] and [[Crete]]. The device became famous for its use of a [[differential gear]], previously believed to have been invented in the 16th century, and the miniaturization and complexity of its parts, comparable to a clock made in the 18th century. The original mechanism is displayed in the Bronze collection of the [[National Archaeological Museum of Athens]], accompanied by a replica.\n\nDepending on the historian's viewpoint, the acme or corruption of physical Greek astronomy is seen with [[Ptolemy|Ptolemy of Alexandria]], who wrote the classic comprehensive presentation of geocentric astronomy, the ''Megale Syntaxis'' (Great Synthesis), better known by its Arabic title ''[[Almagest]]'', which had a lasting effect on astronomy up to the [[Renaissance]]. In his ''Planetary Hypotheses'', Ptolemy ventured into the realm of cosmology, developing a physical model of his geometric system, in a universe many times smaller than the more realistic conception of [[Aristarchus of Samos]] four centuries earlier.\n\n===Egypt===\n{{Main|Egyptian astronomy}}\n[[File:Senenmut-Grab.JPG|thumb|Chart from [[Astronomical ceiling of Senemut Tomb|Senemut's tomb]], [[18th dynasty]]<ref>Full version at [http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/100000870#fullscreen Met Museum]</ref>]]\n\nThe precise orientation of the [[Egyptian pyramids]] affords a lasting demonstration of the high degree of technical skill in watching the heavens attained in the 3rd millennium BC.

The rising of [[Sirius]] ([[Egyptian language|Egyptian]]: Sopdet, [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: Sothis) at the beginning of the inundation was a particularly important point to fix in the yearly calendar.\n\nWriting in the [[Roman era]], [[Clement of Alexandria]] gives some idea of the importance of astronomical observations to the sacred rites:\n<blockquote>And after the Singer advances the Astrologer (\u1f61\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03ba\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2), with a ''horologium'' (\u1f61\u03c1\u03bf\u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd) in his hand, and a ''palm'' (\u03c6\u03bf\u03af\u03bd\u03b9\u03be), the symbols of [[ancient Egyptian astronomy|astrology]]. He must know by heart the [[Hermetism|Hermetic]] astrological books, which are four in number. Of these, one is about the arrangement of the fixed stars that are visible; one on the positions of the sun and moon and five planets; one on the conjunctions and phases of the sun and moon; and one concerns their risings.<ref>Clement of Alexandria, ''Stromata'', vi. 4</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe Astrologer's instruments (''horologium'' and ''palm'') are a [[plumb line]] and sighting instrument{{Clarify|date=November 2009}}<!--SEE TALK!-->. They have been identified with two inscribed objects in the [[Egyptian Museum of Berlin|Berlin Museum]]; a short handle from which a plumb line was hung, and a palm branch with a sight-slit in the broader end. The latter was held close to the eye, the former in the other hand, perhaps at arms length. The \"Hermetic\" books which Clement refers to are the Egyptian theological texts, which probably have nothing to do with [[Hellenistic]] [[Hermetism]].<ref>Neugebauer O, ''Egyptian Planetary Texts'', Transactions, American Philosophical Society, Vol. 32, Part 2, 1942, Page 237.</ref>\n\nFrom the tables of stars on the ceiling of the tombs of [[Rameses VI]] and [[Rameses IX]] it seems that for fixing the hours of the night a man seated on the ground faced the Astrologer in such a position that the line of observation of the [[pole star]] passed over the middle of his head. On the different days of the year each hour was determined by a fixed star [[culmination|culminating]] or nearly culminating in it, and the position of these stars at the time is given in the tables as in the centre, on the left eye, on the right shoulder, etc. According to the texts, in founding or rebuilding temples the [[north]] axis was determined by the same apparatus, and we may conclude that it was the usual one for astronomical observations. In careful hands it might give results of a high degree of accuracy.\n\n===China===\n[[Image:Su Song Star Map 2.JPG|thumb|[[History of typography in East Asia|Printed]] star map of [[Su Song]] (1020\u20131101) showing the south polar projection.]]\n{{Main|Chinese astronomy}}\n{{See also|Book of Silk|Chinese astrology|Timeline of Chinese astronomy}}\n\nThe astronomy of [[East Asia]] began in [[China]].

Detailed records of astronomical observations were kept from about the 6th century BC, until the introduction of Western astronomy and the telescope in the 17th century. Chinese astronomers were able to precisely predict eclipses.\n\nMuch of early Chinese astronomy was for the purpose of timekeeping. The Chinese used a lunisolar calendar, but because the cycles of the Sun and the Moon are different, astronomers often prepared new calendars and made observations for that purpose.\n\nAstrological divination was also an important part of astronomy. Astronomers took careful note of \"guest stars\" which suddenly appeared among the [[fixed star]]s. They were the first to record a supernova, in the Astrological Annals of the Houhanshu in 185 AD. Also, the supernova that created the [[Crab Nebula]] in 1054 is an example of a \"guest star\" observed by Chinese astronomers, although it was not recorded by their European contemporaries.

Kepler was, however, the first to attempt to derive mathematical predictions of celestial motions from assumed physical causes. Kepler discovered the three laws of planetary motion that now carry his name. Those laws being as follows:\n\n#The orbit of a planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one of the two foci.\n#A line segment joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time.\n#The square of the orbital period of a planet is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit.<ref>Bruce Stephenson (1994). ''Kepler's Physical Astronomy''. [[Princeton University Press]]. p. 170. {{ISBN|0-691-03652-7}}.</ref>\n\nWith these laws, he managed to improve upon the existing Heliocentric model. The first two were published in 1609. Kepler's contributions improved upon the overall system, giving it more credibility because it adequately explained events and could cause more reliable predictions. Before this the Copernican model was just as unreliable as the ptolemaic model.  This improvement came because Kepler realized the orbits were not perfect circles, but ellipses.[[Image:galileo.arp.300pix.jpg|thumb|[[Galileo Galilei]] (1564\u20131642) crafted his own telescope and discovered that our Moon had craters, that Jupiter had moons, that the Sun had spots, and that Venus had phases like our Moon.]]Galileo Galilei was among the first to use a telescope to observe the sky, and after constructing a 20x refractor telescope.<ref>GINGERICH, O.

Realizing that the same force that attracts objects to the surface of the Earth held the moon in orbit around the Earth, Newton was able to explain\u2014in one theoretical framework\u2014all known gravitational phenomena. In his [[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]], he derived Kepler's laws from first principles. Those first principles are as follows:\n\n#In an [[inertial frame of reference]], an object either remains at rest or continues to move at constant [[velocity]], unless acted upon by a [[force]].\n#In an inertial reference frame, the vector [[Vector sum|sum]] of the [[Forces|force]]s F on an object is equal to the [[Mass|mas]]s m of that object multiplied by the [[acceleration]] a of the object: F = ma.

It was proved that the [[chemical element]]s found in the Sun (chiefly [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]]) were also found on Earth.\nDuring the 20th century [[spectroscopy]] (the study of these lines) advanced, especially because of the advent of [[quantum physics]], that was necessary to understand the observations.\n\nAlthough in previous centuries noted astronomers were exclusively male, at the turn of the 20th century women began to play a role in the great discoveries. In this period prior to modern computers, women at the [[United States Naval Observatory]] (USNO), [[Harvard University]], and other astronomy research institutions began to be hired as human \"computers,\" who performed the tedious calculations while scientists performed research requiring more background knowledge. [http://maia.usno.navy.mil/women_history/history.html]  A number of discoveries in this period were originally noted by the women \"computers\" and reported to their supervisors. For example, at the Harvard Observatory [[Henrietta Swan Leavitt]] discovered the [[cepheid variable]] star period-luminosity relation which she further developed into a method of measuring distance outside of our solar system. [[Annie Jump Cannon]], also at Harvard, organized the stellar [[stellar classification|spectral types]] according to stellar temperature.

This had a major impact on astronomy, spawning the fields of [[infrared astronomy]], [[radio astronomy]], [[x-ray astronomy]] and finally [[gamma-ray astronomy]]. With the advent of [[spectroscopy]] it was proven that other stars were similar to our own sun, but with a range of [[temperature]]s, [[mass]]es and sizes. The existence of our [[galaxy]], the [[Milky Way]], as a separate group of stars was only proven in the 20th century, along with the existence of \"external\" galaxies, and soon after, the expansion of the [[universe]] seen in the recession of most galaxies from us.\n\n==See also==\n{{Wikipedia books|Astronomy}}\n{{Portal|Astronomy|X-ray astronomy|Radio}}\n<!-- New links in alphabetical order please -->\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Age of the universe]]\n* [[Anthropic principle]]\n* [[Archaeoastronomy]]\n* [[Big Bang]]\n* [[Cosmology]]\n* [[History of astrology]]\n* [[History of Mars observation]]\n* [[History of supernova observation]]\n* [[History of telescopes]]\n* [[Hebrew astronomy]]\n* [[Letters on Sunspots]]\n* [[Metric expansion of space]]\n* [[Patronage in Astronomy]]\n* [[Physical cosmology]]\n* [[Timeline of astronomy]]\n* [[List of astronomical instrument makers]]\n* [[List of astronomers]]\n* [[List of Russian astronomers and astrophysicists]]\n* [[List of astronomical observatories]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n<!--See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Footnotes for an explanation of how to generate footnotes using the <ref(erences/)> tags-->\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Historians of astronomy==\n* Scholars Past.

The obvious source was atmospheric nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>), comprising nearly 80% of the air, however N<sub>2</sub> is exceptionally stable and will not readily react with other chemicals.

On each pass only about 15% conversion occurs, but any unreacted gases are recycled, and eventually an overall conversion of 97% is achieved.<ref name=Appl/>\n\nThe steam reforming, shift conversion, carbon dioxide removal, and methanation steps each operate at pressures of about {{convert|2.5|\u2013|3.5|MPa|abbr=on|bar psi}}, and the ammonia synthesis loop operates at pressures ranging from {{convert|6|\u2013|18|MPa|abbr=on|bar psi}}, depending upon which proprietary process is used.<ref name=Appl/>\n\n===Sources of hydrogen===\nThe major source of hydrogen is [[methane]] from [[natural gas]]. The conversion, [[steam reforming]], is conducted with steam in a high temperature and pressure tube inside a reformer with a nickel catalyst, separating the carbon and hydrogen atoms in the natural gas.\n\n===Reaction rate and equilibrium===\nNitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) is very unreactive because the [[molecules]] are held together by strong [[Chemical bond|triple bonds]]. The Haber process relies on catalysts that accelerate the scission of this triple bond.\n\nTwo opposing considerations are relevant to this synthesis: the position of the equilibrium and the [[reaction rate|rate of reaction]]. At room temperature, the equilibrium is strongly in favor of ammonia, but the reaction doesn't proceed at a detectable rate. The obvious solution is to raise the temperature, but because the reaction is [[exothermic reaction|exothermic]], the equilibrium constant (using bar or [[atmosphere (unit)|atm]] units) becomes 1 around {{convert|150|\u2013|200|\u00b0C|F|abbr=on}}.

Thus one might suppose that a low temperature is to be used and some other means to increase rate. However, the catalyst itself requires a temperature of at least 400&nbsp;\u00b0C to be efficient.\n\n[[Pressure]] is the obvious choice to favor the forward reaction because there are 4&nbsp;moles of reactant for every 2&nbsp;moles of product (see [[entropy]]), and the pressure used ({{convert|15|\u2013|25|MPa|abbr=on|bar psi}}) alters the equilibrium concentrations to give a profitable yield.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nEconomically, pressure is an expensive commodity. Pipes, valves, and reaction vessels need to be strengthened, and there are safety considerations of working at 20&nbsp;MPa. In addition, running pumps and compressors takes considerable energy. Thus the compromise used gives a single pass yield of around 15%.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\nAnother way to increase the yield of the reaction would be to remove the product (i.e. ammonia gas) from the system. In practice, gaseous ammonia is not removed from the reactor itself, since the temperature is too high; it is removed from the equilibrium mixture of gases leaving the reaction vessel. The hot gases are cooled enough, whilst maintaining a high pressure, for the ammonia to condense and be removed as liquid. Unreacted hydrogen and nitrogen gases are then returned to the reaction vessel to undergo further reaction.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\n===Catalysts===\nThe most popular catalysts are based on iron promoted with K<sub>2</sub>O, CaO, SiO<sub>2</sub>, and Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. The original Haber\u2013Bosch reaction chambers used [[osmium]] as the catalyst, but it was available in extremely small quantities. Haber noted [[uranium]] was almost as effective and easier to obtain than osmium. Under Bosch's direction in 1909, the BASF researcher [[Alwin Mittasch]] discovered a much less expensive [[iron]]-based catalyst, which is still used today. Some ammonia production utilizes [[ruthenium]]-based catalysts (the KAAP process). Ruthenium forms more active catalysts that allows milder operating pressures. Such catalysts are prepared by decomposition of [[triruthenium dodecacarbonyl]] on [[graphite]].<ref name=Appl/>\n\nIn industrial practice, the iron catalyst is obtained from finely ground iron powder, which is usually obtained by reduction of high purity [[magnetite]] (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>). The pulverized iron metal is burnt (oxidized) to give magnetite of a defined particle size. The magnetite particles are then partially reduced, removing some of the [[oxygen]] in the process. The resulting catalyst particles consist of a core of magnetite, encased in a shell of [[w\u00fcstite]] (FeO, ferrous oxide), which in turn is surrounded by an outer shell of iron metal. The catalyst maintains most of its bulk volume during the reduction, resulting in a highly porous high surface area material, which enhances its effectiveness as a catalyst. Other minor components of the catalyst include [[Calcium oxide|calcium]] and [[aluminium oxide]]s, which support the iron catalyst and help it maintain its surface area. These oxides of Ca, Al, K, and Si are unreactive to reduction by the hydrogen.<ref name=Appl/>\n\n[[File:Potential energy diagram for ammonia synthesis.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|energy diagram]]\nThe [[reaction mechanism]], involving the heterogeneous catalyst, is believed to involve the following steps:<ref>{{cite web |last1=Wennerstr\u00f6m |first1=H\u00e5kan |last2=Lidin |first2=Sven |title=Scientific Background on the Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2007 Chemical Processes on Solid Surfaces |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2007/advanced-chemistryprize2007.pdf |website=NobelPrize.org |publisher=Swedish Academy of Sciences |accessdate=17 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n# N<sub>2</sub> (g) \u2192 N<sub>2</sub> (adsorbed)\n# N<sub>2</sub> (adsorbed) \u2192 2&nbsp;N (adsorbed)\n# H<sub>2</sub> (g) \u2192 H<sub>2</sub> (adsorbed)\n# H<sub>2</sub> (adsorbed) \u2192 2&nbsp;H (adsorbed)\n# N (adsorbed) + 3&nbsp;H(adsorbed)\u2192 NH<sub>3</sub> (adsorbed)\n# NH<sub>3</sub> (adsorbed) \u2192 NH<sub>3</sub> (g)\n\nReaction 5 occurs in three steps, forming NH, NH<sub>2</sub>, and then NH<sub>3</sub>.

The site offers a matchmaking engine called 'Meet Me' and an extended profile feature called \"Hotlists\". The domain hotornot.com is currently owned by Hot Or Not Limited,<ref>{{cite web|title=Hot or Not Privacy Policy|url=http://hotornot.com/privacy/|publisher=Hot Or Not|accessdate=6 April 2015}}</ref> and was previously owned by [[Avid Life Media]]. 'Hot or Not' was a significant influence on the people who went on to create the [[social media]] sites [[Facebook]] and [[YouTube]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = Rich, Thriving, Busy: Where Hot Or Not's Co-Founders Are Today|url = http://abcnews.go.com/Business/founders-hot-today/story?id=23901082|website = ABC News|date = 2014-06-03|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\nUsers would submit photographs of themselves to the site for the purpose of other users to rate said person's attractiveness on a [[Scale of one to ten|scale of 1 - 10]], with the cumulative average acting as the overall score for a given photograph.\n\n==History==\nThe site was founded in October 2000 by James Hong and Jim Young, two friends and [[Silicon Valley]]-based engineers. Both graduated from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in electrical engineering, with Young pursuing a [[Ph.D]] at the time. It was inspired by some other developers' ideas.\n\nThe site was a technical solution to a disagreement the founders had one day over a passing woman's attractiveness. The site was originally called \"Am I Hot or Not\". Within a week of launching, it had reached almost two million page views per day. Within a few months, the site was immediately behind [[CNET]] and [[NBCi]] on [[NetNielsen Rating]]'s Top 25 advertising domains. To keep up with rising costs Hong and Young added a [[matchmaking]] component to their website called \"Meet Me at Hot or Not\", i.e. a system of [[range voting]].<ref name=hotOrNotSolution>{{cite web|last=Levy|first=Steven|title=The 'Hot or Not' Solution|url=http://www.rangevoting.org/LevyNewsweek17Dec07.html|accessdate=9 March 2013}}</ref>  The matchmaking service has been especially successful and the site continues to generate most of its revenue through subscriptions. In the December 2006 issue of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, the founders of [[YouTube]] stated that they originally set out to make a version of Hot or Not with Video before developing their more inclusive site. [[Mark Zuckerberg]] of [[Facebook]] similarly got his start by creating a Hot or Not type site called [[Facemash|FaceMash]], where he posted photos from [[Harvard University|Harvard]]'s Facebook for the university's community to rate.<ref>[https://techcrunch.com/2010/10/05/facemash-sale/ Facemash.com, Home of Zuckerberg's Facebook Predecessor, For Sale] TechCrunch, October 5, 2010.

Regardless, despite any [[Head start (positioning)|head starts]] of its predecessors, Hot or Not quickly became the most popular. Since AmIHotOrNot.com's launch, the concept has spawned many imitators. The concept always remained the same, but the subject matter varied greatly. The concept has also been integrated with a wide variety of dating and matchmaking systems. In 2007 BecauseImHot.com launched and deleted anyone with a rating below 7 after a voting audit or the first 50 votes (whichever is first).\n\n==Research==\nIn 2005, as an example of using [[image morphing]] methods to study the effects of [[averageness]], imaging researcher Pierre Tourigny created a composite of about 30 faces to find out the current standard of good looks on the Internet (as shown above). On the Hot or Not web site, people rate others' attractiveness on a scale of 1 to 10. An average score based on hundreds or even thousands of individual ratings takes only a few days to emerge. To make this hot or not palette of morphed images, photos from the site were sorted by rank and used SquirlzMorph to create multi-morph composites from them. Unlike projects like Face of Tomorrow,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.faceoftomorrow.com |title=faceoftomorrow.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150801070644/http://faceoftomorrow.com/ |archivedate=1 August 2015 }}</ref> where the subjects are posed for the purpose, the portraits are blurry because the source images are of low resolution with differences in variables such as posture, hair styles and glasses, so that in this instance images could use only 36 control points for the morphs.<ref>Manitou (2006).

Moreover, according to these researchers, one of the basic functions of the brain is to classify images into a hot or not type categorization. The study's researchers also discovered that sexy shots induce a uniquely powerful reaction in the brain, equal in effect for both men and women, and that erotic images produced a strong reaction in the [[hypothalamus]].<ref>Wittlin, Maggie, \"[http://www.seedmagazine.com/news/2006/07/hot_or_not.php Hot or Not \u2013 Women\u2019s brains respond to erotic images as quickly and strongly as men\u2019s]\".

[[Common Intermediate Format|CIF]])\n* 704x576 (a.k.a. 4CIF)\n* 1408x1152 (a.k.a. 16CIF)\n\nIn March 1997, an informative Appendix I describing Error Tracking \u2013 an encoding technique for providing improved robustness to data losses and errors, was approved to provide information for the aid of implementers having an interest in such techniques.\n\n=== H.263v2 (H.263+) ===\nH.263v2 (also known as ''H.263+'', or as ''the 1998 version of H.263'') is the informal name of the second edition of the ITU-T H.263 international video coding standard. It retained the entire technical content of the original version of the standard, but enhanced H.263 capabilities by adding several annexes which can substantially improve encoding efficiency and provide other capabilities (such as enhanced robustness against data loss in the transmission channel). The H.263+ project was ratified by the ITU in February 1998.  It added the following Annexes:\n* Annex I \u2013 Advanced INTRA Coding mode\n* Annex J \u2013 [[Deblocking filter (video)|Deblocking Filter mode]]\n* Annex K \u2013 Slice Structured mode\n* Annex L \u2013 Supplemental Enhancement Information Specification\n* Annex M \u2013 Improved PB-frames mode\n* Annex N \u2013 Reference Picture Selection mode\n* Annex O \u2013 Temporal, SNR, and Spatial Scalability mode\n* Annex P \u2013 Reference picture resampling\n* Annex Q \u2013 Reduced-Resolution Update mode (see implementors' guide correction as noted below)\n* Annex R \u2013 Independent Segment Decoding mode\n* Annex S \u2013 Alternative INTER VLC mode\n* Annex T \u2013 Modified Quantization mode\nH.263v2 also added support for flexible customized picture formats and custom picture clock frequencies.  As noted above, the only picture formats previously supported in H.263 had been Sub-QCIF, QCIF, [[Common Intermediate Format|CIF]], 4CIF, and 16CIF, and the only picture clock frequency had been 30000/1001 (approximately 29.97) clock ticks per second.\n\nH.263v2 specified a set of recommended modes in an informative appendix (Appendix II, since deprecated):\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" style=\"font-size: 100%; text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!\n!Level 1\n!Level 2\n!Level 3\n|-\n!

These annexes and an additional annex that specified profiles (approved the following year) were originally published as separate documents from the main body of the standard itself. The additional annexes specified are:\n* Annex U \u2013 Enhanced reference picture selection mode\n* Annex V \u2013 Data-partitioned slice mode\n* Annex W \u2013 Additional supplemental enhancement information specification\n* Annex X (originally specified in 2001) \u2013 Profiles and levels definition\n\nThe prior informative Appendix II (recommended optional enhancement) was obsoleted by the creation of the normative Annex X.\n\nIn June 2001, another informative appendix (Appendix III, Examples for H.263 encoder/decoder implementations) was approved.  It describes techniques for encoding and for error/loss concealment by decoders.\n\nIn January 2005, a unified H.263 specification document was produced (with the exception of Appendix III, which remains as a separately-published document).\n\nIn August 2005, an implementors guide was approved to correct a small error in the seldom-used Annex Q reduced-resolution update mode.\n\n==Open-source implementation==\nIn countries without software patents, H.263 video can be legally encoded<ref>http://www.mplayerhq.hu/DOCS/HTML/en/menc-feat-enc-libavcodec.html</ref> and decoded with the free [[LGPL]]-licensed [[libavcodec]] library (part of the [[FFmpeg]] project) which is used by programs such as [[ffdshow]], [[VLC media player]] and [[MPlayer]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[H.262/MPEG-2 Part 2]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n*  [http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-H.263/ The ITU-T specification for H.263]\n*  [https://web.archive.org/web/20011030094328/http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/avt-charter.html IETF AVT Working Group] - Group that reviews codec packetizations for [[Real-time Transport Protocol|RTP]]\n**  RFC 4629 - RTP Payload Format for ITU-T Rec.

The most basic such formation is the 10&nbsp;nm fiber or beads on a string conformation.  This involves the wrapping of DNA around nucleosomes with approximately 50 base pairs of [[DNA]] separating each pair of [[nucleosome]]s (also referred to as linker [[DNA]]). Higher-order structures include the 30&nbsp;nm fiber (forming an irregular zigzag) and 100&nbsp;nm fiber, these being the structures found in normal cells.  During mitosis and meiosis, the condensed [[chromosome]]s are assembled through interactions between nucleosomes and other regulatory proteins.\n\nHistones are subdivided into canonical replication-dependent histones that are expressed during the S-phase of cell cycle and replication-independent [[histone variants]], expressed during the whole cell cycle. In animals, genes encoding canonical histones are typically clustered along the chromosome, lack introns and use a stem loop structure at the 3\u2019 end instead of a polyA tail. Genes encoding histone variants are usually not clustered, have introns and their mRNAs are regulated with polyA tails. Complex multicellular organisms typically have a higher number of histone variants providing a variety of different functions. Recent data are accumulating about the roles of diverse histone variants highlighting the functional links between variants and the delicate regulation of organism development. Histone variants from different organisms, their classification and variant specific features can be found in [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/HistoneDB2.0/ \"HistoneDB 2.0 - Variants\"] database.\n\nThe following is a list of human histone proteins:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!

The 4 'core' histones (H2A, H2B, H3 and H4) are relatively similar in structure and are highly conserved through [[evolution]], all featuring a '[[helix turn helix]] turn helix' motif (DNA-binding protein motif that recognize specific DNA sequence).  They also share the feature of long 'tails' on one end of the [[amino acid]] structure - this being the location of post-translational modification (see below).\n\nIt has been proposed that histone proteins are evolutionarily related to the helical part of the extended AAA+ ATPase domain, the C-domain, and to the N-terminal substrate recognition domain of Clp/Hsp100 proteins.

Based on Rodriguez-Paredes and Esteller, Nature, 2011]]\n\nA huge catalogue of histone modifications have been described, but a functional understanding of most is still lacking. Collectively, it is thought that histone modifications may underlie a [[histone code]], whereby combinations of histone modifications have specific meanings. However, most functional data concerns individual prominent histone modifications that are biochemically amenable to detailed study.\n\n===Chemistry of histone modifications===\n\n==== Lysine methylation ====\n[[File:methyl lysine.svg|right|300px]]\n\nThe addition of one, two, or many methyl groups to lysine has little effect on the chemistry of the histone; methylation leaves the charge of the lysine intact and adds a minimal number of atoms so steric interactions are mostly unaffected. However, proteins containing Tudor, chromo or PHD domains, amongst others, can recognise lysine methylation with exquisite sensitivity and differentiate mono, di and tri-methyl lysine, to the extent that, for some lysines (e.g.: H4K20) mono, di and tri-methylation appear to have different meanings. Because of this, lysine methylation tends to be a very informative mark and dominates the known histone modification functions.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==== Arginine methylation ====\n[[File:methyl arginine.svg|right|350px]]\n\nWhat was said above of the chemistry of lysine methylation also applies to arginine methylation, and some protein domains\u2014e.g., Tudor domains\u2014can be specific for methyl arginine instead of methyl lysine. Arginine is known to be mono- or di-methylated, and methylation can be symmetric or asymmetric, potentially with different meanings.\n\n==== Arginine citrullination ====\n\nEnzymes called [[Protein-arginine deiminase|peptidylarginine deiminases]] (PADs) hydrolyze the imine group of arginines and attach a keto group, so that there is one less positive charge on the amino acid residue. This process has been involved in the activation of gene expression by making the modified histones less tightly bound to DNA and thus making the chromatin more accessible.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Christophorou MA, Castelo-Branco G, Halley-Stott RP, Oliveira CS, Loos R, Radzisheuskaya A, Mowen KA, Bertone P, Silva JC, Zernicka-Goetz M, Nielsen ML, Gurdon JB, Kouzarides T | title = Citrullination regulates pluripotency and histone H1 binding to chromatin | journal = Nature | volume = 507 | issue = 7490 | pages = 104\u20138 | date = Mar 2014 | pmid = 24463520 | doi = 10.1038/nature12942 | url = https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/254537 | pmc = 4843970 }}</ref> PADs can also produce the opposite effect by removing or inhibiting mono-methylation of arginine residues on histones and thus antagonizing the positive effect arginine methylation has on transcriptional activity.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cuthbert GL, Daujat S, Snowden AW, Erdjument-Bromage H, Hagiwara T, Yamada M, Schneider R, Gregory PD, Tempst P, Bannister AJ, Kouzarides T | title = Histone deimination antagonizes arginine methylation | journal = Cell | volume = 118 | issue = 5 | pages = 545\u201353 | date = Sep 2004 | pmid = 15339660 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2004.08.020 }}</ref>\n\n==== Lysine acetylation ====\n[[File:acetyl lysine.tif|right]]\n\nAddition of an acetyl group has a major chemical effect on lysine as it neutralises the positive charge. This reduces electrostatic attraction between the histone and the negatively charged DNA backbone, loosening the chromatin structure; highly acetylated histones form more accessible chromatin and tend to be associated with active transcription.

These proteins are synthesized during S phase of the cell cycle. There are different mechanisms which contribute to the increase of histone synthesis. \n\n=== Yeast ===\nYeast carry one or two copies of each histone gene, which are not clustered but rather scattered throughout chromosomes. Histone gene transcription is controlled by multiple gene regulatory proteins such as transcription factors which bind to histone promoter regions. In budding yeast, the candidate gene for activation of histone gene expression is SBF. SBF is a transcription factor that is activated in late G1 phase, when it dissociates from its repressor Whi5. This occurs when Whi5 is phosphorylated by Cdc8 which is a G1/S Cdk.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = de Bruin RA, McDonald WH, Kalashnikova TI, Yates J, Wittenberg C | title = Cln3 activates G1-specific transcription via phosphorylation of the SBF bound repressor Whi5 | journal = Cell | volume = 117 | issue = 7 | pages = 887\u201398 | date = June 2004 | pmid = 15210110 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2004.05.025 }}</ref>   Suppression of histone gene expression outside of S phases is dependent on Hir proteins which form inactive chromatin structure at the locus of histone genes, causing transcriptional activators to be blocked.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Xu H, Kim UJ, Schuster T, Grunstein M | title = Identification of a new set of cell cycle-regulatory genes that regulate S-phase transcription of histone genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae | journal = Molecular and Cellular Biology | volume = 12 | issue = 11 | pages = 5249\u201359 | date = November 1992 | pmid = 1406694 | doi =  10.1128/mcb.12.11.5249 | pmc=360458}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Dimova D, Nackerdien Z, Furgeson S, Eguchi S, Osley MA | title = A role for transcriptional repressors in targeting the yeast Swi/Snf complex | journal = Molecular Cell | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = 75\u201383 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10445029 | doi = 10.1016/S1097-2765(00)80189-6  }}</ref>\n\n=== Metazoans ===\nIn metazoans the increase in the rate of histone synthesis is due to the increase in processing of pre-mRNA to its mature form as well as decrease in mRNA degradation; this results in an increase of active mRNA for translation of histone proteins.

This arrangement is a form of a [[hierarchy]]. In an organization, the hierarchy usually consists of a singular/group of [[Power (social and political)|power]] at the top with subsequent levels of power beneath them. This is the dominant mode of organization among large organizations; most [[corporation]]s, [[Forms of government|governments]], and [[organized religion]]s are hierarchical organizations with different levels of [[management]], power or [[authority]]. For example, the broad, top-level overview of the general organization of the [[Catholic Church hierarchy|Catholic Church]] consists of the [[Pope]], then the [[Cardinal (Catholic)|Cardinals]], then the [[Archbishop]]s, and so on. \n\nMembers of hierarchical organizational structures chiefly communicate with their immediate superior and with their immediate subordinates. Structuring organizations in this way is useful partly because it can reduce the communication overhead by limiting information flow; this is also its major limitation.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\n==Visualization==\nA hierarchy is typically visualized as a [[pyramid (geometry)|pyramid]], where the height of the ranking or person depicts their power status and the width of that level represents how many people or business divisions are at that level relative to the whole\u2014the highest-ranking people are at the [[Apex (geometry)|apex]], and there are very few of them; the [[Base (geometry)|base]] may include thousands of people who have no subordinates. These hierarchies are typically depicted with a [[tree structure|tree]] or [[triangle]] [[diagram]], creating an [[organizational chart]] or organigram. Those nearest the top have more power than those nearest the bottom, and there being fewer people at the top than at the bottom. As a result, superiors in a hierarchy generally have higher status and command greater rewards than their subordinates.\n\n==Common models==\nAll governments and most companies have similar structures. Traditionally, the [[monarch]] was the pinnacle of the [[State (polity)|state]]. In many countries, [[feudalism]] and [[manorialism]] provided a formal [[social structure]] that established hierarchical links at every level of society, with the monarch at the top. \n\nIn modern post-feudal states the nominal top of the hierarchy still remains the [[head of state]], which may be a [[president]] or a [[constitutional monarch]], although in many modern states the powers of the head of state are delegated among different bodies. Below the head, there is commonly a [[senate]], [[parliament]] or [[congress]], which in turn often delegate the day-to-day running of the country to a [[prime minister]]. In many [[democracies]], the people are considered to be the notional top of the hierarchy, over the head of state; in reality, the people's power is restricted to voting in elections.\n\nIn business, the business owner traditionally occupied the pinnacle of the [[organization]]. In most modern large companies, there is now no longer a single dominant shareholder, and the collective power of the business owners is for most purposes delegated to a [[board of directors]], which in turn delegates the day-to-day running of the company to a [[managing director]] or [[CEO]]. Again, although the shareholders of the company are the nominal top of the hierarchy, in reality many companies are run at least in part as personal fiefdoms by their management; [[corporate governance]] rules are an attempt to mitigate this tendency.\n\n== Studies ==\nThe [[organizational development]] theorist [[Elliott Jacques]] identified a special role for hierarchy in his concept of [[requisite organization]]. \n \nThe [[iron law of oligarchy]], introduced by [[Robert Michels]], describes the inevitable tendency of hierarchical organizations to become [[oligarchy|oligarchic]] in their decision making.\n\nThe [[Peter principle|Peter Principle]] is a term coined by [[Laurence J. Peter]] in which the selection of a candidate for a position in an  hierarchical organization is based on the candidate's performance in their current role, rather than on abilities relevant to the intended role. Thus, employees only stop being promoted once they can no longer perform effectively, and managers in an hierarchical organization \"rise to the level of their incompetence.\" \n\n[[Hierarchiology]] is another term coined by Laurence J. Peter, described in his humorous book of the same name, to refer to the study of hierarchical organizations and the behavior of their members.\n\n{{quote|Having formulated the Principle, I discovered that I had inadvertently founded a new science, hierarchiology, the study of hierarchies. The term hierarchy was originally used to describe the system of church government by priests graded into ranks. The contemporary meaning includes any organization whose members or employees are arranged in order of rank, grade or class. Hierarchiology, although a relatively recent discipline, appears to have great applicability to the fields of public and private administration.|Dr. [[Laurence J. Peter]] and [[Raymond Hull]]|''[[The Peter Principle]]: Why Things Always Go Wrong''}}\n\n[[The IRG Solution \u2013 hierarchical incompetence and how to overcome it]] argued that hierarchies were inherently incompetent, and were only able to function due to large amounts of informal [[lateral communication]] fostered by private informal networks.\n\n==Criticism and alternatives==\nIn the work of diverse theorists such as [[William James]] (1842\u20131910), [[Michel Foucault]] (1926\u20131984) and [[Hayden White]], important critiques of hierarchical epistemology are advanced. James famously asserts in his work \"Radical Empiricism\" that clear distinctions of type and category are a constant but unwritten goal of scientific reasoning, so that when they are discovered, success is declared. But if aspects of the world are organized differently, involving inherent and intractable ambiguities, then scientific questions are often considered unresolved. A hesitation to declare success upon the discovery of ambiguities leaves heterarchy at an artificial and subjective disadvantage in the scope of human knowledge. This bias is an artifact of an aesthetic or pedagogical preference for hierarchy, and not necessarily an expression of objective observation.\n\nHierarchies and hierarchical thinking has been criticized by many people, including [[Susan McClary]] and one political philosophy which is vehemently opposed to hierarchical organization: [[anarchism]]. [[Heterarchy]] is the most commonly proposed alternative to hierarchy and this has been combined with [[responsible autonomy]] by [[Gerard Fairtlough]] in his work on [[Triarchy]] theory. The most beneficial aspect of a hierarchical organization is the clear command that is established. However, hierarchy may become dismantled by abuse of power.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nAmidst constant innovation in information and communication technologies, hierarchical authority structures are giving way to greater decision-making latitude for individuals and more flexible definitions of job activities and this new style of work presents a challenge to existing organizational forms, with some research studies contrasting traditional organizational forms against groups that operate as online communities that are characterized by personal motivation and the satisfaction of making one's own decisions.<ref>Zhao, Rosson, Rosson (2007).

Both Milligan and Sellers credited him with keeping the act on the bill when club owners had wanted to sack them.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}\n\nAfter a regional touring career, his first break came in radio when he was chosen as resident comedian for the Welsh series ''[[Welsh Rarebit (radio programme)|Welsh Rarebit]],'' followed by appearances on ''[[Variety Bandbox]]'' and a regular role in ''[[Educating Archie]]''.\n\nSecombe met [[Michael Bentine]] at the Windmill Theatre, and was introduced to [[Peter Sellers]] by his agent [[Jimmy Grafton]]. Together with Spike Milligan, the four wrote a comedy radio script, and ''Those Crazy People'' was commissioned<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/thegoonshow/ \"Comedy The Goon Show\"], BBC website</ref> and first broadcast on 28 May 1951.

Trained under Italian [[maestro]] [[Manlio di Veroli]], he emerged as a ''[[bel canto]]'' [[tenor]] (characteristically, he insisted that in his case this meant \"can belto\") and had a long list of best-selling record albums to his credit.<ref name=\"BBCWales\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/southwest/halloffame/showbiz/harrysecombe.shtml|title=Sir Harry Secombe|publisher=BBC Wales|accessdate=2 March 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn 1958 he appeared in the film ''[[Jet Storm]],'' which starred [[Sybil Thorndike|Dame Sybil Thorndike]] and [[Richard Attenborough]]<!-- he wasn't knighted until 1976. --> and in the same year Secombe starred in the title role in ''[[Davy (film)|Davy]]'', one of [[Ealing Studios]]' last films.<ref name=\"BBCWales\"/>\n\nThe power of his voice allowed Secombe to appear in many stage [[Musical theater|musicals]]. This included 1963's ''[[Pickwick (musical)|Pickwick]],'' based on [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[The Pickwick Papers]]'', which gave him the number 18 hit single \"[[If I Ruled the World]]\" \u2013 his later signature tune.

A [[sketch comedy]] show featuring [[Julian Orchard]] as Secombe's regular [[sidekick]], the series also featured guest appearances by fellow Goon Spike Milligan as well as leading performers such as [[Ronnie Barker]] and [[Arthur Lowe]].

When compared to the opioids [[hydromorphone]], [[fentanyl]], [[oxycodone]], and [[pethidine]] (meperidine), former addicts showed a strong preference for heroin and morphine, suggesting that heroin and morphine are particularly susceptible to abuse and addiction.

It may be prescribed for the treatment of acute pain, such as in severe [[physical trauma]], [[myocardial infarction]], post-[[surgery|surgical]] pain and [[chronic pain]], including  end-stage [[terminal illness]]es. In other countries it is more common to use morphine or other strong opioids in these situations. In 2004 the [[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence]] produced guidance on the management of [[caesarean section]], which recommended the use of [[intrathecal]] or [[epidural]] diamorphine for post-operative [[pain relief]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg132/chapter/1-recommendations#procedural-aspects-of-cs |title=National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (2011) Caesarean section.NICE Guideline (CG132) |accessdate=28 October 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151025180200/http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg132/chapter/1-recommendations#procedural-aspects-of-cs |archivedate=25 October 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nDiamorphine continues to be widely used in [[palliative care]] in the UK, where it is commonly given by the [[Subcutaneous injection|subcutaneous]] route, often via a [[syringe driver]], if patients cannot easily swallow [[morphine|morphine solution]]. The advantage of diamorphine over morphine is that diamorphine is more [[lipophilicity|fat soluble]] and therefore more potent by injection, so smaller doses of it are needed for the same effect on pain. Both of these factors are advantageous if giving high doses of opioids via the subcutaneous route, which is often necessary in palliative care.\n\n====Maintenance therapy====\n{{Main|Heroin-assisted treatment}}\nA number of European countries prescribe heroin for treatment of [[heroin addiction]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lintzeris|first1=N|title=Prescription of heroin for the management of heroin dependence: current status|journal=CNS Drugs|date=2009|volume=23|issue=6|pages=463\u201376|pmid=19480466|doi=10.2165/00023210-200923060-00002}}</ref> Diamorphine may be used as a [[heroin maintenance|maintenance drug]] to assist the treatment of opiate addiction, normally in long-term chronic intravenous (IV) heroin users. It is only prescribed following exhaustive efforts at treatment via other means. It is sometimes thought that heroin users can walk into a clinic and walk out with a prescription, but the process takes many weeks before a prescription for diamorphine is issued. Though this is somewhat controversial among proponents of a [[zero-tolerance]] [[drug policy]], it has proven superior to [[methadone]] in improving the social and health situations of addicts.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Haasen C, Verthein U, Degkwitz P, Berger J, Krausz M, Naber D | title = Heroin-assisted treatment for opioid dependence: Randomised controlled trial | journal = The British Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 191 | pages = 55\u201362 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17602126 | doi = 10.1192/bjp.bp.106.026112 }}</ref>\n\nThe UK Department of Health's [[Rolleston Committee]] Report<ref>{{cite web|title=Rolleston Report|url=http://www.drugtext.org/Table/Rolleston-Report/|publisher=Departmental Commission on Morphine and Heroin Addiction, United Kingdom|accessdate=28 January 2011|year=1926|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110417125310/http://www.drugtext.org/Table/Rolleston-Report/|archivedate=17 April 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> in 1926 established the British approach to diamorphine prescription to users, which was maintained for the next 40 years: dealers were prosecuted, but doctors could prescribe diamorphine to users when withdrawing. In 1964 the [[Brain Committee]] recommended that only selected approved doctors working at approved specialised centres be allowed to prescribe diamorphine and benzoylmethylecgonine ([[cocaine]]) to users. The law was made more restrictive in 1968. Beginning in the 1970s, the emphasis shifted to abstinence and the use of methadone; currently only a small number of users in the UK are prescribed diamorphine.<ref>{{cite web| last =Goldacre| first =Ben| year =1998| url =http://www.badscience.net/?p=327| title =Methadone and Heroin: An Exercise in Medical Scepticism| accessdate =18 December 2006| deadurl =no| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070304065723/http://www.badscience.net/?p=327| archivedate =4 March 2007| df =dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn 1994, Switzerland began a trial [[heroin-assisted treatment|diamorphine maintenance]] program for users that had failed multiple withdrawal programs.

While the onset of the rush induced by injection can occur in as little as a few seconds, the oral route of administration requires approximately half an hour before the high sets in. Thus, with both higher the dosage of heroin used and faster the route of administration used, the higher potential risk for psychological [[addiction]].\n\nLarge doses of heroin can cause fatal respiratory depression, and the drug has been used for suicide or as a murder weapon.

Heroin base (commonly found in Europe), when prepared for injection, will only dissolve in water when mixed with an acid (most commonly citric acid powder or lemon juice) and heated. Heroin in the east-coast United States is most commonly found in the hydrochloride salt form, requiring just water (and no heat) to dissolve. Users tend to initially inject in the easily accessible arm veins, but as these veins collapse over time, users resort to more dangerous areas of the body, such as the [[femoral vein]] in the groin. Users who have used this route of administration often develop a [[deep vein thrombosis]].{{medcn|date=April 2014}} Intravenous users can use a various single dose range using a [[hypodermic needle]]. The dose of heroin used for recreational purposes is dependent on the frequency and level of use: thus a first-time user may use between 5 and 20&nbsp;mg, while an established addict may require several hundred mg per day. As with the injection of any drug, if a group of users [[needle sharing|share a common needle]] without sterilization procedures, blood-borne diseases, such as [[HIV/AIDS]] or [[hepatitis]], can be transmitted.\nThe use of a common dispenser for water for the use in the preparation of the injection, as well as the sharing of spoons and/or filters can also cause the spread of blood-borne diseases. Many countries now supply small sterile spoons and filters for single use in order to prevent the spread of disease.<ref>http://www.idaat.org/files/documents_file-4.pdf {{dead link |date=July 2017 }}</ref>\n\n===Smoking===\nSmoking heroin refers to vaporizing it to inhale the resulting fumes, rather than burning and inhaling the smoke. It is commonly smoked in glass pipes made from [[glassblowing|glassblown]] [[Pyrex|Pyrex tubes]] and light bulbs. Heroin may be smoked from aluminium foil, which is heated by an underneath flame, with the resulting smoke inhaled through a tube of rolled up foil, a method also known as \"[[chasing the dragon]]\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Strang|first=J.|last2=Griffiths|first2=P.|last3=Gossop|first3=M.|date=June 1997|title=Heroin smoking by 'chasing the dragon': origins and history|journal=Addiction|volume=92|issue=6|pages=673\u2013683; discussion 685\u2013695|issn=0965-2140|pmid=9246796|doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.1997.tb02927.x}}</ref>\n\n===Insufflation===\nAnother popular route to intake heroin is [[insufflation]] (snorting), where a user crushes the heroin into a fine powder and then gently inhales it (sometimes with a straw or a rolled-up [[banknote]], as with cocaine) into the nose, where heroin is absorbed through the soft tissue in the [[mucous membrane]] of the [[sinus cavity]] and straight into the bloodstream. This method of administration redirects [[First pass effect|first-pass metabolism]], with a quicker onset and higher bioavailability than oral administration, though the duration of action is shortened. This method is sometimes preferred by users who do not want to prepare and administer heroin for injection or smoking, but still experience a fast onset. Snorting heroin becomes an often unwanted route, once a user begins to inject the drug. The user may still get high on the drug from snorting, and experience a nod, but will not get a rush. A \"rush\" is caused by a large amount of heroin entering the body at once. When the drug is taken in through the nose, the user does not get the rush because the drug is absorbed slowly rather than instantly.\n\n===Suppository===\nLittle research has been focused on the [[suppository]] (anal insertion) or [[pessary]] (vaginal insertion) methods of administration, also known as \"plugging\". These methods of administration are commonly carried out using an [[oral syringe]]. Heroin can be dissolved and withdrawn into an oral syringe which may then be lubricated and inserted into the anus or vagina before the plunger is pushed. The rectum or the vaginal canal is where the majority of the drug would likely be taken up, through the membranes lining their walls.\n\n==Adverse effects==\nLike most [[opioids]], unadulterated heroin may lead to adverse effects. The purity of street heroin varies greatly, leading to overdoses when the purity is higher than they expected.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/26/us/heroin-fentanyl.html|title=Heroin Epidemic Is Yielding to a Deadlier Cousin: Fentanyl|last=Seelye|first=Katharine Q.|date=2016-03-25|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=2016-05-15|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517152627/http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/26/us/heroin-fentanyl.html|archivedate=17 May 2016|deadurl=no|issn=0362-4331|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== Short term effects ===\n[[File:Short-term effects of heroin.png|thumb|Short-term effects of usage<ref name=\"ONDCP\">{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/drugfact/heroin/heroin_ff.html#healtheffects |title=Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP): Heroin Facts & Figures |publisher=Whitehousedrugpolicy.gov |accessdate=20 July 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110806022931/http://www.whitehousedrugpolicy.gov/drugfact/heroin/heroin_ff.html#healtheffects |archivedate=6 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>]]\nUsers report an intense [[Rush (psychology)|rush]], an acute transcendent state of [[euphoria]], which occurs while diamorphine is being metabolized into [[6-monoacetylmorphine]] (6-MAM) and morphine in the brain. Some believe that heroin produces more euphoria than other opioids; one possible explanation is the presence of 6-monoacetylmorphine, a metabolite unique to heroin \u2013 although a more likely explanation is the rapidity of onset. While other opioids of recreational use produce only morphine, heroin also leaves 6-MAM, also a psycho-[[active metabolite]]. However, this perception is not supported by the results of clinical studies comparing the physiological and subjective effects of injected heroin and morphine in individuals formerly addicted to opioids; these subjects showed no preference for one drug over the other. Equipotent injected doses had comparable action courses, with no difference in subjects' self-rated feelings of euphoria, ambition, nervousness, relaxation, drowsiness, or sleepiness.<ref name=\"martin and fraser\" /> The rush is usually accompanied by a warm flushing of the skin, dry mouth, and a heavy feeling in the extremities. &nbsp;[[Nausea]], [[vomiting]], and severe [[itch]]ing may also occur.

Studies have shown some deterioration of the brain's white matter due to heroin use, which may affect decision-making abilities, the ability to regulate behavior, and responses to stressful situations. Heroin also produces profound degrees of tolerance and physical dependence. Tolerance occurs when more and more of the drug is required to achieve the same effects.

This reverses the effects of heroin and other opioids and causes an immediate return of consciousness but may result in [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] symptoms. The [[half-life]] of naloxone is shorter than most opioids, so that it has to be administered multiple times until the opioid has been metabolized by the body.\n\nDepending on drug interactions and numerous other factors, death from overdose can take anywhere from several minutes to several hours. Death usually occurs due to [[Hypoxia (medical)|lack of oxygen]] resulting from the lack of breathing caused by the opioid.

Most commercial opiate screening tests cross-react appreciably with these metabolites, as well as with other biotransformation products likely to be present following usage of street-grade diamorphine such as 6-acetylcodeine and codeine. However, chromatographic techniques can easily distinguish and measure each of these substances. When interpreting the results of a test, it is important to consider the diamorphine usage history of the individual, since a chronic user can develop tolerance to doses that would incapacitate an opiate-naive individual, and the chronic user often has high baseline values of these metabolites in his system. Furthermore, some testing procedures employ a hydrolysis step before quantitation that converts many of the metabolic products to morphine, yielding a result that may be 2&nbsp;times larger than with a method that examines each product individually.<ref>{{cite book |first=R. |last=Baselt |title=Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man |edition=9th |publisher=Biomedical Publications |location=Seal Beach, CA |year=2011 |pages=793\u20137 |isbn=978-0-9626523-8-7}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:BayerHeroin.png|thumb|upright|Advertisement for [[Bayer]] Heroin]]\n\n{{see also|History of opium in China}}\n\nThe [[opium poppy]] was cultivated in lower [[Mesopotamia]] as long ago as 3400 BCE.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/heroin/etc/history.html|title=Opium Throughout History|publisher=PBS Frontline|accessdate=22 October 2006|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060923053042/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/heroin/etc/history.html|archivedate=23 September 2006|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The chemical analysis of [[opium]] in the 19th century revealed that most of its activity could be ascribed to two [[alkaloids]], [[codeine]] and [[morphine]].\n\nDiamorphine was first synthesized in 1874 by [[C.

The penalty applies even to citizens of countries where the penalty is not in place, sometimes causing controversy when foreign visitors are arrested for trafficking, for example the arrest of [[Bali Nine|nine Australians in Bali]], the [[death sentence]] given to [[Nola Blake]] in Thailand in 1987, or the hanging of an Australian citizen [[Van Tuong Nguyen]] in Singapore.\n\n====Trafficking history====\n[[File:HeroinWorld-en.svg|thumb|400px|Primary worldwide producers of heroin]]\n\nThe origins of the present international illegal heroin trade can be traced back to laws passed in many countries in the early 1900s that closely regulated the production and sale of opium and its derivatives including heroin. At first, heroin flowed from countries where it was still legal into countries where it was no longer legal. By the mid-1920s, heroin production had been made illegal in many parts of the world. An illegal trade developed at that time between heroin labs in China (mostly in Shanghai and Tianjin) and other nations. The weakness of government in China and conditions of civil war enabled heroin production to take root there. Chinese [[Triad society|triad]] gangs eventually came to play a major role in the illicit heroin trade. The [[French Connection]] route started in the 1930s.\n\nHeroin trafficking was virtually eliminated in the U.S. during [[World War II]] because of temporary trade disruptions caused by the war. Japan's war with China had cut the normal distribution routes for heroin and the war had generally disrupted the movement of opium. After World War II, [[the Mafia]] took advantage of the weakness of the postwar Italian government and set up heroin labs in Sicily. The Mafia took advantage of Sicily's location along the historic route opium took westward into Europe and the United States.<ref>Eric C. Schneider, ''Smack:  Heroin and the American City'', University of Pennsylvania Press, 2008, chapter one</ref> Large-scale international heroin production effectively ended in China with the victory of the communists in the civil war in the late 1940s.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} The elimination of Chinese production happened at the same time that Sicily's role in the trade developed.\n\nAlthough it remained legal in some countries until after World War II, health risks, addiction, and widespread recreational use led most western countries to declare heroin a controlled substance by the latter half of the 20th century. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the [[CIA]] supported anti-Communist Chinese Nationalists settled near the [[China|Sino]]-Burmese border and [[Hmong people|Hmong]] tribesmen in [[Laos]]. This helped the development of the [[Golden Triangle (Southeast Asia)|Golden Triangle]] opium production region, which supplied about one-third of heroin consumed in US after the 1973 American withdrawal from Vietnam. In 1999, Burma, the heartland of the Golden Triangle, was the second largest producer of heroin, after [[Afghanistan]].<ref name=\"Afghan_Burmese_heroin\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1590827.stm|title=War Views: Afghan heroin trade will live on.|date=October 2001|work=Richard Davenport-Hines|publisher=BBC|accessdate=30 October 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115095732/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1590827.stm|archivedate=15 January 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe Soviet-Afghan war led to increased production in the Pakistani-Afghan border regions, as U.S.-backed [[mujaheddin]] militants raised money for arms from selling opium, contributing heavily to the modern [[Golden Crescent]] creation. By 1980, 60 percent of heroin sold in the U.S. originated in Afghanistan.<ref name=\"Afghan_Burmese_heroin\"/> It increased international production of heroin at lower prices in the 1980s. The trade shifted away from Sicily in the late 1970s as various criminal organizations violently fought with each other over the trade. The fighting also led to a stepped-up government law enforcement presence in Sicily.\n\nFollowing the discovery at a Jordanian airport of a [[toner cartridge]] that had been modified into an [[improvised explosive device]], the resultant increased level of airfreight scrutiny led to a major shortage (drought) of heroin from October 2010 until April 2011. This was reported in most of mainland Europe and the UK which led to a price increase of approximately 30 percent in the cost of street heroin and an increased demand for diverted [[methadone]]. The number of addicts seeking treatment also increased significantly during this period. Other heroin droughts (shortages) have been attributed to cartels restricting supply in order to force a price increase and also to a fungus that attacked the opium crop of 2009.

One aspect of harm reduction initiatives focuses on the behaviour of individual users. In the case of diamorphine, this includes promoting safer means of taking the drug, such as smoking, nasal use, oral or rectal insertion. This attempts to avoid the higher risks of overdose, infections and [[Blood-borne disease|blood-borne viruses]] associated with injecting the drug. Other measures include using a small amount of the drug first to gauge the strength, and minimize the risks of overdose. For the same reason, [[poly drug use]] (the use of two or more drugs at the same time) is discouraged. Injecting diamorphine users are encouraged to use new needles, syringes, spoons/steri-cups and filters every time they inject and not share these with other users. Users are also encouraged to not use it on their own, as others can assist in the event of an overdose.\n\nGovernments that support a harm reduction approach usually fund [[needle-exchange programme|needle and syringe exchange programs]], which supply new needles and syringes on a confidential basis, as well as education on proper filtering before injection, safer injection techniques, safe disposal of used injecting gear and other equipment used when preparing diamorphine for injection may also be supplied including citric acid sachets/vitamin C sachets, steri-cups, filters, alcohol pre-injection swabs, sterile water ampules and tourniquets (to stop use of shoe laces or belts).\n\nAnother harm reduction measure employed for example in Europe, Canada and Australia are [[safe injection sites]] where users can inject diamorphine and [[cocaine]] under the supervision of medically trained staff. Safe injection sites are low threshold and allow social services to approach problem users that would otherwise be hard to reach.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kimber J, Dolan K, Wodak A | title = Survey of drug consumption rooms: service delivery and perceived public health and amenity impact | journal = Drug and Alcohol Review | volume = 24 | issue = 1 | pages = 21\u20134 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16191717 | doi = 10.1080/09595230500125047 }}</ref>\nIn the UK the Criminal Justice System has a protocol in place that requires that any individual that is arrested and is suspected of having a substance misuse problem be offered the chance to enter a treatment program. This has had the effect of drastically reducing an area's crime rate as individuals arrested for theft in order to supply the funds for their drugs are no longer in the position of having to steal to purchase heroin because they have been placed onto a [[methadone]] program, quite often more quickly than would have been possible had they not been arrested. This aspect of harm reduction is seen as being beneficial to both the individual and the community at large, who are then protected from the possible theft of their goods.<ref>http://www.idaat.org/files/newsletters_file-8.pdf{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>Lancashire Constabulary-Harm Reduction in the Community page 7</ref>\n\nDuring the late 1980s and early 1990s, Swiss authorities ran the ZIPP-AIDS (Zurich Intervention Pilot Project), handing out free syringes in the officially tolerated drug scene in [[Platzspitz park]].<ref name=\"urlNCJRS Abstract - National Criminal Justice Reference Service\">{{cite web|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/publications/abstract.aspx?ID=146728|title=NCJRS Abstract - National Criminal Justice Reference Service|format=|website=|accessdate=2016-03-04|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306090806/https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/publications/abstract.aspx?ID=146728|archivedate=6 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In 1994, Zurich started a pilot project using prescription heroin in heroin-assisted treatment (HAT) which allowed users to obtain heroin and inject it under medical supervision.<ref name=\"pmid11705488\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Rehm J, Gschwend P, Steffen T, Gutzwiller F, Dobler-Mikola A, Uchtenhagen A |title=Feasibility, safety, and efficacy of injectable heroin prescription for refractory opioid addicts: a follow-up study |journal=Lancet |volume=358 |issue=9291 |pages=1417\u201323 |year=2001 |pmid=11705488 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(01)06529-1 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(01)06529-1 |accessdate=2016-03-04}}</ref> The HAT program proved to be cost-beneficial to society and improve patients overall health and social stability<ref name=\"pmid11705488\"/> and has since been introduced in multiple European countries.<ref name=\"urlHeroin Assisted Treatment | Drug Policy Alliance\">{{cite web|url=http://www.drugpolicy.org/resource/heroin-assisted-treatment-hat|title=Heroin Assisted Treatment &#124; Drug Policy Alliance|format=|website=|accessdate=2016-03-04|quote=Netherlands, United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, Denmark, Belgium, Canada, and Luxembourg|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160316041752/http://www.drugpolicy.org/resource/heroin-assisted-treatment-hat|archivedate=16 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Research==\nResearchers are attempting to reproduce the biosynthetic pathway that produces [[morphine]] in [[genetically engineered]] [[yeast]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn27546-home-brew-heroin-soon-anyone-will-be-able-to-make-illegal-drugs/|title=Home-brew heroin: soon anyone will be able to make illegal drugs|publisher=New Scientist|author=Michael Le Page|date=18 May 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160413033207/https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn27546-home-brew-heroin-soon-anyone-will-be-able-to-make-illegal-drugs/|archivedate=13 April 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In June 2015 the ''S''-reticuline could be produced from sugar and ''R''-reticuline could be converted to morphine, but the intermediate reaction could not be performed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.sciencemag.org/biology/2015/06/final-step-sugar-morphine-conversion-deciphered|title=Final step in sugar-to-morphine conversion deciphered|publisher=Science|author=Robert F.

The team won the [[List of Italian football champions|Serie A Championship]] in [[1984\u201385 Serie A|1984\u201385]].\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Origins and early history ===\nFounded in 1903 by a group of high school students, the club was named ''Hellas'' (the Greek word for [[Greece]]), at the request of a professor of [[classics]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Bertoldi|first=Luigi|title=80 anni di storia del Verona Calcio|year=1983|publisher=Editoriale Bortolazzi-Stei s.r.l.|location=Verona|isbn= |page=11}}</ref> At a time in which football was played seriously only in the larger cities of the northwest of Italy, most of Verona was indifferent to the growing sport. However, when in 1906 two city teams chose the city's Roman amphitheatre as a venue to showcase the game, crowd enthusiasm and media interest began to rise.\n\nDuring these first few years, Hellas was one of three or four area teams playing mainly at a municipal level while fighting against city rivals Bentegodi to become the city's premier football outfit. By the 1907\u201308 season, Hellas was playing against regional teams and an intense rivalry with [[Vicenza Calcio|Vicenza]] that lasts to this day was born.\n\nFrom 1898 to 1926, Italian football was organised into regional groups. In this period, Hellas was one of the founding teams of the early league and often among its top final contenders. In 1911, the city helped Hellas replace the early, gritty football fields with a proper venue. This allowed the team to take part in its first regional tournament, which until 1926, was the qualifying stage for the national title.\n\nIn 1919, following a return to activity after a four-year suspension of all football competition in Italy during World War I, the team merged with city rival Verona and changed its name to Hellas Verona. Between 1926 and 1929, the elite \"''Campionato Nazionale''\" assimilated the top sides from the various regional groups and Hellas Verona joined the privileged teams, yet struggled to remain competitive.\n\n[[Serie A]], as it is structured today, began in 1929, when the ''Campionato Nazionale'' turned into a professional league. Still an amateur team, Hellas merged with two city rivals, Bentegodi and Scaligera, to form AC Verona. Hoping to build a first class contender for future years the new team debuted in Serie B in 1929. It would take the ''gialloblu'' 28 years to finally achieve their goal. After first being promoted to Serie A for one season in 1957\u201358, in 1959, the team merged with another city rival (called Hellas) and commemorated its beginnings by changing its name to Hellas Verona AC.\n\n=== Success in the 1970s and 1980s ===\nCoached by [[Nils Liedholm]], the team returned to Serie A in 1968 and remained in the elite league almost without interruption until 1990. Along the way, it scored a famous 5\u20133 win in the 1972\u201373 season that cost [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] the ''[[scudetto]]'' (the Serie A title). The fact that the result came late during the last matchday of the season makes the sudden and unexpected end to the ''rossoneri'''s title ambitions all the more memorable.\n\nIn 1973\u201374, Hellas finished the season in fourth-last, just narrowly avoiding relegation, but were nonetheless sent down to [[Serie B]] during the summer months as a result of a scandal involving team president Saverio Garonzi. After a year in Serie B, Hellas returned to Serie A.\n\nIn the 1975\u201376 season, the team had a successful run in the [[Coppa Italia]], eliminating highly rated teams such as [[Torino F.C.|Torino]], [[Cagliari Calcio|Cagliari]] and [[Inter Milan|Internazionale]] from the tournament. However, in their first ever final in the competition, Hellas were trounced 4\u20130 by [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]].\n\nUnder the leadership of coach [[Osvaldo Bagnoli]], in 1982\u201383 the team secured a fourth-place in Serie A (its highest finish at the time) and even led the Serie A standings for a few weeks. The same season Hellas again reached the Coppa Italia final. After a 2\u20130 home victory, Hellas then travelled to [[Turin]] to play [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] but were defeated 3\u20130 after extra time.\n\nFurther disappointment followed in the 1983\u201384 season when the team again reached the Coppa Italia final, only to lose the Cup in the final minutes of the return match against defending Serie A champions [[A.S. Roma|Roma]]\n\nThe team made its first European appearance in the [[1983-84 UEFA Cup]] and were knocked out in the second round of the tournament by [[SK Sturm Graz|Sturm Graz]]. Hellas were eliminated from the [[1985\u201386 European Cup]] in the second round by defending champions and fellow Serie A side Juventus after a contested game, the result of a scandalous arbitrage by the French Wurtz, having beaten [[PAOK F.C.|PAOK]] of Greece in the first round.<ref>{{Cite news| title = 1985/86 European Champions Clubs' Cup| url = http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/season=1985/clubs/club=52301/history/index.html| publisher = uefa.com| accessdate = | date=}}</ref>\n\nIn 1988, the team had their best international result when they reached the UEFA Cup quarterfinals with four victories and three draws. The decisive defeat came from German side [[SV Werder Bremen|Werder Bremen]].\n\n=== 1984\u20131985 ''Scudetto'' ===\nAlthough the [[1984\u201385 Serie A|1984\u201385 season]] squad was made up of a mix of emerging players and mature stars, at the beginning of the season no one would have regarded the team as having the necessary ingredients to make it to the end. Certainly, the additions of [[Hans-Peter Briegel]] in midfield and of Danish striker [[Preben Elkj\u00e6r Larsen|Preben Elkj\u00e6r]] to an attack that already featured the wing play of [[Pietro Fanna]], the creative abilities of [[Antonio Di Gennaro]] and the scoring touch of [[Giuseppe Galderisi]] were to prove crucial.\n\nTo mention a few of the memorable milestones on the road to the ''scudetto'': a decisive win against Juventus (2\u20130), with a goal scored by Elkj\u00e6r after having lost a boot in a tackle just outside the box, set the stage early in the championship; an away win over [[Udinese Calcio|Udinese]] (5\u20133) ended any speculation that the team was losing energy at the midway point; three straight wins (including a hard fought 1\u20130 victory against a strong Roma side) served notice that the team had kept its polish and focus intact during their rival's final surge; and a 1\u20131 draw in [[Bergamo]] against [[Atalanta B.C.|Atalanta]] secured the title with a game in hand.\n\nHellas finished the year with a 15\u201313\u20132 record and 43 points, four points ahead of [[Torino F.C.]] with Internazionale and [[U.C. Sampdoria|Sampdoria]] rounding out the top four spots. This unusual final table of the [[Serie A]] (with the most successful Italian teams of the time, Juventus and Roma, ending up much lower than expected) has led to many speculations. The 1984\u201385 season was the only season when referees were assigned to matches by way of a random draw. Before then each referee had always been assigned to a specific match by a special commission of referees (''designatori arbitrali''). After the betting scandal of the early 1980 (the [[Totonero 1980|Calcio Scommesse scandal]]), it was decided to clean up the image of Italian football by assigning referees randomly instead of picking them, to clear up all the suspicions and accusations always accompanying Italy's football life. This resulted in a quieter championship and in a completely unexpected final table.\n\nIn the following season, won again by Juventus, the choice of the referees went back in the hands of the ''designatori arbitrali''. In 2006, a [[Calciopoli|major scandal in Italian football]] revealed that certain clubs had been illegally influencing the referee selection process in an attempt to ensure that certain referees were assigned to their matches.\n\n=== Between Serie A and Serie B ===\nThese were more than mere modest achievements for a mid-size city with a limited appeal to fans across the nation. But soon enough financial difficulties caught up with team managers. In 1991 the team folded and was reborn as Verona, regularly moving to and fro between Serie A and Serie B for several seasons. In 1995 the name was officially changed back to Hellas Verona.\n\nAfter a three-year stay, their last stint in Serie A ended in grief in 2002. That season emerging international talents such as [[Adrian Mutu]], [[Mauro Camoranesi]], [[Alberto Gilardino]], [[Martin Laursen]], [[Massimo Oddo]], [[Marco Cassetti]] and coach [[Alberto Malesani]] failed to capitalise on an excellent start and eventually dropped into fourth-to-last place for the first time all season on the very last matchday, enforcing relegation into Serie B.\n\n=== Decline and Serie A comeback (2002\u20132016) ===\nFollowing the 2002 relegation to Serie B, team fortunes continued to slip throughout the decade. In the 2003\u201304 season Hellas Verona struggled in [[Serie B]] and spent most of the season fighting off an unthinkable relegation to [[Serie C1]]. Undeterred, the fans supported their team and a string of late season wins eventually warded off the danger. Over 5,000 of them followed Hellas to Como on the final day of the season to celebrate.\n\nIn 2004\u201305, things looked much brighter for the team. After a rocky start, Hellas put together a string of results and climbed to third spot. The ''giallobl\u00f9'' held on to the position until January 2005, when transfers weakened the team, yet they managed to take the battle for Serie A to the last day of the season.\n\nThe [[2006\u201307 Serie B]] seemed to start well, due to the club takeover by [[Pietro Arvedi D'Emilei]], which ended nine years of controversial leadership under chairman [[Gianbattista Pastorello]], heavily contested by the supporters in his later years at Verona. However, Verona was immediately involved in the relegation battle, and [[Massimo Ficcadenti]] was replaced in December 2006 by [[Giampiero Ventura]]. Despite a recovery in the results, Verona ended in an 18th place, thus being forced to play a two-legged playoff against 19th-placed [[Spezia Calcio 1906|Spezia]] to avert relegation. A 2\u20131 away loss in the first leg at La Spezia was followed by a 0\u20130 home tie, and Verona were relegated to [[Serie C1]] after 64 years of play in the two highest divisions.\n\nVerona appointed experienced coach [[Franco Colomba]] for the new season with the aim to return to Serie B as soon as possible. However, despite being widely considered the division favourite, the ''giallobl\u00f9'' spent almost the entire season in last place. After seven matches, club management sacked Colomba in early October and replaced him with youth team coach (and former Verona player) [[Davide Pellegrini]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.channel4.com/sport/football_italia/oct8f.html |publisher=Football Italia |title=Punch-drunk Verona fire Colomba |date=8 October 2007 |accessdate=14 November 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201124950/http://www.channel4.com/sport/football_italia/oct8f.html |archivedate=1 December 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref> A new owner acquired the club in late 2007, appointing [[Giovanni Galli]] in December as new director of football and [[Maurizio Sarri]] as new head coach. Halfway through the 2007\u201308 season, the team remained at the bottom of Serie C1, on the brink of relegation to the fourth level ([[Serie C2]]). In response, club management sacked Sarri and brought back Pellegrini. Thanks to a late-season surge the ''scaligeri'' avoided direct relegation by qualifying for the relegation play-off, and narrowly averted dropping to [[Lega Pro Seconda Divisione]] in the final game, beating [[Aurora Pro Patria 1919|Pro Patria]] 2\u20131 on aggregate. However, despite the decline in results, attendance and season ticket sales remained on 15,000 average.\n\nFor the 2008\u201309 season, Verona appointed former [[U.S. Sassuolo Calcio|Sassuolo]] and [[Piacenza Calcio|Piacenza]] manager [[Gian Marco Remondina]] with the aim to win promotion to Serie B. However, the season did not start impressively, with Verona being out of the playoff zone by mid-season, and club chairman [[Pietro Arvedi D'Emilei]] entering into a coma after being involved in a car crash on his way back from a league match in December 2008. Arvedi died in March 2009, two months after the club was bought by new chairman Giovanni Martinelli.\n\nThe following season looked promising, as new transfer players were brought aboard, and fans enthusiastically embraced the new campaign. Season ticket figures climbed to over 10,000, placing Verona ahead of several Serie A teams and all but Torino in Serie B attendance.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Tifosi dell'Hellas Verona: 10.442 abbonamenti! |url=http://www.hellasweb.it/news/tifosi-dellhellas-verona-10-442-abbonamenti |publisher=hellasweb.it |accessdate= |date= |language=italian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722041141/http://www.hellasweb.it/news/tifosi-dellhellas-verona-10-442-abbonamenti |archivedate=22 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The team led the standings for much of the season, accumulating a seven-point lead by early in the spring. However, the advantage was gradually squandered, and the team dropped to second place on the second-last day of the season, with a chance to regain first place in the final regular season match against [[Calcio Portogruaro Summaga|Portogruaro]] on home soil. Verona, however, disappointed a crowd of over 25,000 fans<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.datasport.it/news/2010/maggio/9/26248/lega-pro-tabellini-34a-giornata.html |publisher=Data Sport |title=Lega Pro 1/B: i tabellini della 34.a giornata |date=9 May 2009 |accessdate=8 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100512164623/http://www.datasport.it/news/2010/maggio/9/26248/lega-pro-tabellini-34a-giornata.html |archivedate=12 May 2010 }}</ref> and, with the loss, dropped to third place and headed towards the play-offs. A managerial change for the post-season saw the firing of Remondina and the arrival of [[Giovanni Vavassori]]. After eliminating [[A.C. Rimini 1912|Rimini]] in the semi-finals (1\u20130; 0\u20130) Verona lost the final to [[Delfino Pescara 1936|Pescara]] (2\u20132 on home soil and 0\u20131 in the return match) and were condemned to a fourth-straight year of third division football.\n\nFormer [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990 World Cup]] star [[Giuseppe Giannini]] (a famous captain of Roma for many years) signed as manager for the 2010\u201311 campaign. Once again, the team was almost entirely revamped during the transfer season. The squad struggled in the early months and Giannini was eventually sacked and replaced by former Internazionale defender [[Andrea Mandorlini]], who succeeded in reorganising the team's play and bringing discipline both on and off the pitch. In the second half of the season, Verona climbed back from the bottom of the division to clinch a play-off berth (fifth place) on the last day of the regular season. The team advanced to the play-off final after eliminating [[Sorrento Calcio|Sorrento]] in the semi-finals 3\u20131 on aggregate. Following the play-off final, after four years of Lega Pro football, Verona were promoted back to Serie B after a 2\u20131 aggregate win over [[U.S. Salernitana 1919|Salernitana]] on 19 June 2011.\n\nOn 18 May 2013, Verona finished second in Serie B and were promoted to Serie A after an 11-year absence.<ref>{{Cite news| title = Hellas Verona back in Serie A after 11 years away| url = https://sports.yahoo.com/news/soccer-hellas-verona-back-serie-11-years-away-174534103.html| publisher = sports.yahoo.com| accessdate =| date=18 May 2013}}</ref> Their return to the top flight began against title contenders Milan and Roma, beating the former 2\u20131 and losing to the latter 3\u20130. The team continued at a steady pace, finishing the first half of the season with 32 points and sitting in sixth place\u201411 points behind the closest [[UEFA Champions League]] spot\u2014and tied with Internazionale for the final [[UEFA Europa League]] spot. Verona, however, ultimately finished the year in tenth.\n\nDuring the [[2015\u201316 Serie A|2015\u201316 season]], Verona hadn't won a single match since the beginning of the campaign until the club edged [[Atalanta B.C.|Atalanta]] 2\u20131 on 3 February 2016 in a win at home; coming twenty-three games into the season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.com/italian-serie-a/match/432040/hellas-verona-atalanta/report|title=Hellas Verona claim long-awaited first Serie A win of the season|publisher=ESPNFC|date=3 February 2016|accessdate=3 February 2016}}</ref> Consequently, Verona were relegated from Serie A.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.us/italian-serie-a/match/431919/hellas-verona-ac-milan/report|title=Hellas Verona relegated from Serie A despite late win over AC Milan|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n== Colours and badge ==\nThe team's colours are yellow and blue and ''gialloblu'' (literally, \"yellow-blue\" in Italian) is the team's most widely used nickname. The colours represent the city itself and Verona's [[emblem]] (a yellow cross on a blue shield) appears on most team apparel. Two more team nicknames are ''Mastini'' (the [[English Mastiff|mastiff]]s) and ''Scaligeri'', both references to [[Mastino I della Scala]] of the [[Scaliger|Della Scala princes]] that ruled the city during the 13th and 14th centuries.\n\nThe Scala family [[coat of arms]] is depicted on the team's jersey and on its trademark logo as a stylised image of two large, powerful mastiffs facing opposite directions, introduced in 1995.<ref>{{cite news|title=Getting shirty ~ Hellas Verona, 1995\u201396|work=wsc.co.uk|publisher=When Saturday Comes|date=19 August 2014|accessdate=17 March 2017|url=http://www.wsc.co.uk/wsc-daily/1185-august-2014/11814-getting-shirty-hellas-verona-1995-96}}</ref> In essence, the term \"''scaligeri''\" is synonymous with Veronese, and therefore can describe anything or anyone from Verona (e.g., [[A.C.

Chievo Verona|Chievo Verona]] are known as the \"[[Derby della Scala]]\". The name refers to the [[Scaligeri]] or della Scala aristocratic family, who were rulers of [[Verona]] during the [[Middle Ages]] and early [[Renaissance]]. In the season [[2001\u201302 Serie A|2001\u201302]], both Hellas Verona and the city rivals of Chievo Verona were playing in the [[Serie A]]. The first ever derby of Verona in Serie A took place on 18 November 2001, while both teams were ranked among the top four. The match was won by Hellas, 3\u20132. Chievo got revenge in the return match in spring 2002, winning 2\u20131. Verona thus became the fifth city in Italy, after [[Derby della Madonnina|Milan]], [[Derby della Capitale|Rome]], [[Derby della Mole|Turin]] and [[Derby della Lanterna|Genoa]] to host a cross-town derby in Serie A.<ref>{{cite news|title=Verona derby top dogs|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/1664718.stm|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|date=19 November 2001}}</ref>\n\n== Honours ==\n*'''[[Serie A]]''' champions: [[Serie A 1984-85|1984\u201385]]<ref>{{Cite news| title = Winners| url = http://www.legaseriea.it/en/serie-a-tim/albo-d-oro| publisher = Lega Nazionale Professionisti Serie A | accessdate = | date=}}</ref>\n*'''[[Serie B]]''' champions: [[Serie B 1956-57|1956\u201357]], [[Serie B 1981-82|1981\u201382]], 1998\u201399<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesi/ital2champ.html|title=Italy&nbsp;\u2013 List of Second Division (Serie B) Champions|work=The Record Sport Soccer Statistics Foundation|accessdate=28 May 2013}}</ref>\n*'''[[Coppa Italia]]:''' runners-up: 1976, 1983, 1984<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesi/italcuphist.html|title=Italy&nbsp;\u2013 List of Cup Finals|work=The Record Sport Soccer Statistics Foundation|accessdate=28 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Sponsors ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}\n\n=== Kit sponsors ===\n* 1980\u201387: Adidas\n* 1987\u201389: Hummel\n* 1989\u201391: Adidas\n* 1991\u201395: Uhlsport\n* 1995\u201300: Errea\n* 2000\u201303: Lotto\n* 2003\u201306: Legea\n* 2006\u201313: Asics\n* 2013\u2013present: Nike\n\n=== Official sponsors ===\n* 1982\u201386: [[Canon Inc.|Canon]]\n* 1986\u201389: [[Ricoh]]\n* 1989\u201396: Rana\n* 1996\u201397: Ferroli\n* 1997\u201398: ZG Camini Inox\n* 1998\u201399: Atreyu Immobiliare<ref>1998 [http://archiviostorico.gazzetta.it/1998/novembre/06/Verona_volo_sponsor_picco_ga_0_9811061990.shtml Verona in volo, lo sponsor a picco]</ref>\n* 1999\u201300: Salumi Marsilli\n* 2000\u201301: Net Business\n* 2001\u201302: Amica Chips\n* 2002\u201306: Clerman\n* 2006\u201307: Unika\n* 2007\u201308: ''No sponsor''\n* 2008\u201310: Giallo\n* 2010\u201311: Banca Di Verona/Sicurint Group, Protec/Consorzio Asimov\n* 2011\u201312: AGSM/Sicurint Group, Protec/Leaderform\n* 2012\u201313: AGSM, Leaderform\n* 2013\u201314: Franklin & Marshall/Manila Grace, AGSM/Leaderform\n* 2014\u201315: Franklin & Marshall, AGSM/Leaderform\n* 2015\u2013present: Metano Nord, Leaderform\n\n== Current squad ==\n\n=== First team squad ===<!--Keep this as Current squad or provide an anchor, as there are links to it-->\n<!----------------------------- READ THIS NOTICE FIRST BEFORE EDITING ----------------------------------\n&nbsp;\u2013 Do ''not'' add new players before their signing is OFFICIALLY announced by the club, including medicals\n&nbsp;\u2013 Do ''not'' remove players before their exit is officially announced by the club\n&nbsp;\u2013 Do ''not'' change or add squad numbers until it is official on the club website's squad list\n&nbsp;\u2013 This is Wikipedia, not a football gazette.

The Pali Text Society's ''Pali-English Dictionary'' (1921\u201325) defines ''h\u012bna'' in even stronger terms, with a semantic field that includes \"poor, miserable; vile, base, abject, contemptible\", and \"despicable\".\n\nThe term was translated by [[Kum\u0101raj\u012bva]] and others into [[Classical Chinese]] as \"small vehicle\" (\u5c0f meaning \"small\", \u4e58 meaning \"vehicle\"), although earlier and more accurate translations of the term also exist.

In his translation and commentary of [[Asanga]]'s ''Distinguishing Dharma from Dharmata'', he writes, \"all three traditions of hinayana, mahayana, and vajrayana were practiced in Tibet and that the hinayana which literally means \"lesser vehicle\" is in no way inferior to the mahayana.\"<ref name=\"Khenchen Thrangu Rinpoche, Dharma and Dharmata, note 5\">Khenchen Thrangu Rinpoche. ''Distinguishing Dharma and Dharmata.'' 1999. p. 113</ref>\n\n==Origins==\nAccording to Jan Nattier, it is most likely that the term H\u012bnay\u0101na postdates the term Mah\u0101y\u0101na and was only added at a later date due to antagonism and conflict between the bodhisattva and \u015br\u0101vaka ideals. The sequence of terms then began with the term ''Bodhisattvay\u0101na'' \"bodhisattva-vehicle\", which was given the epithet Mah\u0101y\u0101na \"Great Vehicle\". It was only later, after attitudes toward the bodhisattva teachings had become more critical, that the term H\u012bnay\u0101na was created as a back-formation, contrasting with the already established term Mah\u0101y\u0101na.<ref>Nattier, Jan (2003), ''A few good men: the Bodhisattva path according to the Inquiry of Ugra'': p. 174</ref> The earliest Mah\u0101y\u0101na texts often use the term Mah\u0101y\u0101na as an epithet and synonym for Bodhisattvay\u0101na, but the term H\u012bnay\u0101na is comparatively rare in early texts, and is usually not found at all in the earliest translations. Therefore, the often-perceived symmetry between Mah\u0101y\u0101na and H\u012bnay\u0101na can be deceptive, as the terms were not actually coined in relation to one another in the same era.<ref>Nattier, Jan (2003), ''A few good men: the Bodhisattva path according to the Inquiry of Ugra'': p. 172</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Paul Williams (philosopher)|Paul Williams]], \"the deep-rooted misconception concerning an unfailing, ubiquitous fierce criticism of the Lesser Vehicle by the [Mah\u0101y\u0101na] is not supported by our texts.\"<ref name=\"Williams, Jane 2004. p. 43\">Williams, Jane, and Williams, Paul.

There is no evidence that Mah\u0101y\u0101na ever referred to a separate formal school of Buddhism but rather as a certain set of ideals, and later doctrines.<ref>Nattier, Jan (2003), ''A few good men: the Bodhisattva path according to the Inquiry of Ugra'': p. 193-194</ref> [[Paul Williams (philosopher)|Paul Williams]] has also noted that the Mah\u0101y\u0101na never had nor ever attempted to have a separate [[vinaya]] or ordination lineage from the early Buddhist schools, and therefore [[bhikkhu|bhik\u1e63u]]s and [[bhikkhuni|bhik\u1e63u\u1e47\u012b]]s adhering to the Mah\u0101y\u0101na formally adheres to the vinaya of an early school. This continues today with the [[Dharmaguptaka]] ordination lineage in East Asia and the [[Mulasarvastivada|M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da]] ordination lineage in [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. Mah\u0101y\u0101na was never a separate sect of the early schools.<ref>Williams, Paul (2008) ''Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations'': p. 4-5</ref> From Chinese monks visiting India, we now know that both Mah\u0101y\u0101na and non-Mah\u0101y\u0101na monks in India often lived in the same monasteries side by side.<ref>Williams, Paul (2000) ''Buddhist Thought: A Complete Introduction to the Indian Tradition'': p. 97</ref>\n\nThe Chinese Buddhist monk and pilgrim [[Yijing (monk)|Yijing]] wrote about the relationship between the various \"vehicles\" and the early Buddhist schools in India.

Instead, what is demonstrated in the definition of ''H\u012bnay\u0101na'' given by Yijing is that the term referred to individuals based on doctrinal differences.<ref name=\"Williams, Paul 2008 p. 5\"/>\n\n==H\u012bnay\u0101na as \u015ar\u0101vakay\u0101na==\n\nScholar Isabelle Onians asserts that although \"the Mah\u0101y\u0101na ... very occasionally referred  to earlier Buddhism as the Hinay\u0101na, the Inferior Way, [...] the preponderance of this name in the secondary literature is far out of proportion to occurrences in the Indian texts.\" She notes that the term [[\u015ar\u0101vakay\u0101na]] was \"the more politically correct and much more usual\" term used by Mah\u0101y\u0101nists.<ref>Isabelle Onians, \"Tantric Buddhist Apologetics, or Antinomianism as a Norm,\" D.Phil. dissertation, Oxford, Trinity Term 2001 pg 72</ref> Jonathan Silk has argued that the term \"Hinayana\" was used to refer to whomever one wanted to criticize on any given occasion, and did not refer to any definite grouping of Buddhists.<ref>Jonathan A Silk.

Additionally, the concept of the bodhisattva as one who puts off enlightenment rather than reaching awakening as soon as possible, has no roots in Theravada textual or cultural contexts, current or historical. Aside from the Theravada schools being geographically distant from the Mahayana, the Hinayana distinction is used in reference to certain views and practices that had become found within the Mahayana tradition itself. Theravada, as well as Mahayana schools stress the urgency of one's own awakening in order to end suffering.<ref>Frank J. Hoffman and Deegalle Mahinda, ''P\u0101li Buddhism.''

He was highly praised for his work in ''[[The Petrified Forest]]'' (1936). Bogart had originated the role of Duke Mantee in the 1935 Broadway production, but [[Warner Bros.]] wanted to cast the then much better known [[Edward G.

His breakthrough came in 1941 when his performances in ''[[High Sierra (film)|High Sierra]]'' and ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]'' made him a star. His first true romantic lead role came in 1942's ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'', breaking his [[typecasting (acting)|typecasting]] as a gangster.

By one account, his lip was cut by shrapnel when his ship, the {{USS|Leviathan|ID-1326|6}}, was shelled, although some claim Bogart did not make it to sea until after the Armistice had been signed. Another version, which Bogart's longtime friend, author [[Nathaniel Benchley]], believed, is that Bogart was injured while taking a prisoner to [[Portsmouth Naval Prison]] in [[Kittery, Maine]]. While changing trains in Boston, the handcuffed prisoner allegedly asked Bogart for a cigarette, then while Bogart looked for a match, the prisoner smashed him across the mouth with the cuffs, cutting Bogart's lip and fleeing. Recaptured, the prisoner was taken to jail. An alternative version has Bogart struck in the mouth by a handcuff loosened while freeing his charge, the other still around the prisoner's wrist.<ref>Citro et al. 2005, pp. 240\u2013241.</ref> By the time Bogart was treated by a doctor, a scar had already formed. [[David Niven]] said that when he first asked Bogart about his scar, he said it was caused by a childhood accident. \"Goddamn doctor\", Bogart later told Niven, \"instead of stitching it up, he screwed it up.\" Niven claims the stories that Bogart got the scar during wartime were made up by the studios to inject glamour. His post-service physical makes no mention of the lip scar, even though it mentions many smaller scars.<ref name=\"Sperber p.27\" /> When actress [[Louise Brooks]] met Bogart in 1924, he had some scar tissue on his upper lip, which Brooks said that Bogart may have had partially repaired before entering films in 1930.<ref name=\"Meyers_p18-19\" /> She also said his \"lip wound gave him no speech impediment, either before or after it was mended.\"\n\n== Early career ==\nBogart returned home to find his father suffering from poor health, his medical practice faltering, and much of the family's wealth lost on bad investments in timber.<ref>Sperber and Lax 1997, p. 28.</ref> During his naval days, Bogart's character and values developed independently of family influence, and he began to rebel somewhat against their values. He came to be a liberal who hated pretensions, phonies, and snobs, and at times defied conventional behavior and authority, traits he displayed in both life and the movies. He did not, however, forsake good manners, articulateness, punctuality, modesty, and a dislike of being touched.<ref name=Meyers_p22,31>{{Harvnb|Meyers|1997|pp=22, 31.}}</ref> After his naval service, he worked as a shipper and then bond salesman.<ref name=Meyers_p23>{{Harvnb|Meyers|1997|p=23.}}</ref> He joined the [[United States Coast Guard Reserve|Coast Guard Reserve]].\n\n[[File:Swifty Humphrey Bogart 1922 newspaper.png|thumb|left|Bogart received plaudits in an October 15, 1922 newspaper review of the stage play ''Swifty'', which stated: \"Humphrey Bogart as the erring young man, Tom Proctor, did an excellent bit of work in the main\".<ref>[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030214/1922-10-17/ed-1/seq-8/ \"Chronicling America.\"] ''New-York tribune'', October 17, 1922 via ''Historic American Newspapers'', ''Library of Congress''. <></ref>]]\n\nBogart resumed his friendship with Bill Brady, Jr., whose father had show business connections.

Nobody likes me on sight.

Shooting on a new film might begin days or only hours after the previous one wrapped. The [[studio system]], then at the most entrenched, restricted actors to their home lot, with only occasional loan-outs. Any actor declining a role could be suspended without pay. Bogart disliked the roles chosen for him, but he worked steadily. Between 1936 and 1940, he averaged a film every two months, at times working on two simultaneously.\n\nAmenities at Warners were few compared to the prestigious [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. Bogart thought that the Warners wardrobe department was cheap, and often wore his own suits in his movies. In ''[[High Sierra (film)|High Sierra]]'', Bogart used his own pet dog Zero to play his character's dog, Pard. His disputes with Warner Bros. over roles and money were similar to those the studio waged with other high-spirited, less-than-obedient stars, such as [[Bette Davis]], [[James Cagney]], [[Errol Flynn]] and [[Olivia de Havilland]].<ref name=\"Meyers_p54\">{{Harvnb|Meyers|1997|p=54.}}</ref>\n\n[[File:James Cagney Humphrey Bogart in The Roaring Twenties trailer.jpg|left|thumb|Taking a back seat to [[James Cagney]] in ''[[The Roaring Twenties]]'' (1939)]]\n\nThe leading men ahead of Bogart at Warner Bros. included not only such marquee names as [[James Cagney]] and [[Edward G.

Bogart was gunned down on film repeatedly by Cagney and Edward G. Robinson, among others. In ''[[Black Legion (film)|Black Legion]]'' (1937), for a change, he played a good man caught up and destroyed by a racist organization, a movie [[Graham Greene]] described as \"intelligent and exciting, if rather earnest\".<ref name=Meyers_p67>{{Harvnb|Meyers|1997|p=67.}}</ref>\n\nIn 1938, Warner Bros. put Bogart in a \"[[hillbilly]] musical\" called ''[[Swing Your Lady]]'' as a wrestling promoter; he later apparently considered this his worst film performance.<ref>[[Eric Lax|Lax, Eric]].

Jack Warner settled the dispute and filming resumed.<ref>Sperber and Lax 1997, pp. 263\u2013264.</ref>  Hawks said of Bacall: \"Bogie fell in love with the character she played, so she had to keep playing it the rest of her life.\"<ref name=Meyers_p168>{{Harvnb|Meyers|1997|p=168.}}</ref>\n\n=== ''The Big Sleep'' ===\n[[File:Bogart and Bacall The Big Sleep.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Bacall and Bogart in ''[[The Big Sleep (1946 film)|The Big Sleep]]'' (1946)]]\nJust months after wrapping the film, Bogart and Bacall were reunited for an encore, the film noir ''[[The Big Sleep (1946 film)|The Big Sleep]]'', based on the novel by [[Raymond Chandler]], again with script help from [[William Faulkner]]. Chandler thoroughly admired Bogart's performance: \"Bogart can be tough without a gun. Also, he has a sense of humor that contains that grating undertone of contempt.\"<ref>Sperber and Lax 1997, p. 289.</ref> The film was completed and slated for release in 1945, then withdrawn and substantially re-edited to add new, juiced-up scenes exploiting both the box office chemistry that shone between Bogart and Bacall in ''To Have and Have Not'', and the notoriety of their personal relationship.\n\nAt director Howard Hawks' urging, production partner Charles K. Feldman agreed to Bacall's scenes being re-written to heighten the 'insolent' quality that had intrigued critics and audiences in that film. By chance, a 35-mm nitrate composite master positive (fine grain) of the 1945 version survived. The UCLA Film Archive, in association with Turner Entertainment and with funding provided by [[Hugh Hefner]], restored and released it in 1996.<ref>\"8th Annual Festival of Preservation Program.\" ''UCLA Film & Television Archive'', June 27, 1996.</ref>\n\nWhile filming, Bogart was still torn between his new love and his sense of duty to his marriage. The mood on the set was tense, the actors both emotionally exhausted as Bogart tried to find a way out of his dilemma. The dialogue, especially in the newly shot scenes, was full of sexual [[innuendo]] supplied by Hawks, and Bogart proves convincing and enduring as private detective [[Philip Marlowe]]. In the end, the film was successful, though some critics found the plot confusing and overcomplicated.<ref name=Meyers_p180>{{Harvnb|Meyers|1997|p=180.}}</ref>  Reportedly a bemused Chandler himself could not answer baffled screenwriters' question over who killed the limousine driver early in the story.\n\n=== Marriage ===\n[[File:Bogart Bacall wedding 1945.jpg|thumb|upright|Best man [[Louis Bromfield]] (center) at the wedding of Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall at [[Malabar Farm State Park|Malabar Farm]] (May 21, 1945)]]\nBogart filed for divorce from Methot in February 1945.

After his plastic surgery, the rest of the film is shot normally, with Bogart intent on finding the real murderer in a crime for which he was blamed and sentenced to prison.\n\nThe couple next starred in the future classic, ''[[Key Largo (film)|Key Largo]]''. Directed by John Huston, the film highlighted [[Edward G. Robinson]] as gangster \"Johnny Rocco,\" a seething older synthesis of many of his vicious early bad guy roles. The characters are trapped during a spectacular hurricane in a hotel owned by Bacall's screen father-in-law, played by [[Lionel Barrymore]]. [[Claire Trevor]] won an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for her heart-wrenching performance as Rocco's physically abused alcoholic girlfriend. Though Robinson had always had top billing over Bogart in their previous films together, this time Robinson's name appears to the right of Bogart's, but placed a little higher on the posters and in the film's opening credits, to signify Robinson's near-equal status. Robinson's image was also markedly larger and centered on the original poster, with Bogart relegated to the background.\n\nIn the film's trailer, Bogart is repeatedly mentioned first, but Robinson's name is listed above Bogart's in a cast list at the trailer's end. Robinson's role is evocative of Duke Mantee in ''[[The Petrified Forest]]'' (1936), a Bogart leading man breakthrough the studio had originally earmarked for Robinson.\n\n=== Children ===\nBogart became a first-time father at age 49 when Bacall gave birth to Stephen Humphrey Bogart on January 6, 1949, during the filming of ''[[Tokyo Joe (1949 film)|Tokyo Joe]]''.<ref name=\"Bacall\" /> The name was drawn from Bogart's character's nickname in ''To Have and Have Not'', \"Steve\".<ref>Sperber and Lax 1997, p. 422.</ref> Stephen would go on to become an author and biographer, later hosting a television special about his father on [[Turner Classic Movies]]. Three years later the couple's daughter, Leslie Howard Bogart, was born on August 23, 1952 and she would draw her name from Bogart's friend and ''The Petrified Forest'' co-star, British actor [[Leslie Howard (actor)|Leslie Howard]].<ref name=\"shickelbook\" /><ref name=\"Bacall\" />\n\n== Later career ==\nThe enormous success of ''Casablanca'' redefined Bogart's career. For the first time, Bogart could be cast successfully as both a tough, strong man and vulnerable love interest. Despite his elevated standing, he did not yet have a contractual right of script refusal. When he got weak scripts he simply dug in his heels and locked horns again with the front office, as he did on the film ''Conflict'' (1945).<ref>Sperber and Lax 1997, p. 214.</ref> Though he submitted to Jack Warner on it, he successfully turned down ''[[God Is My Co-Pilot (film)|God is My Co-Pilot]]'' (1945).<ref name=Meyers_p164>{{Harvnb|Meyers|1997|p=164.}}</ref>\n\n=== ''The Treasure of the Sierra Madre'' ===\n[[File:Humphrey Bogart in The Treasure of the Sierra Madre trailer.jpg|thumb|Bogart sports a trademark scruff in the trailer for ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'' (1948).]]\nRiding high in 1947 with a new contract which provided limited script refusal and the right to form his own production company, Bogart reunited with John Huston for ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'', a stark tale of greed played out by three gold prospectors in Mexico. Without either a love interest or happy ending it was deemed a risky project.<ref>Sperber and Lax 1997, p. 337.</ref> Bogart later said of co-star (and John Huston's father) [[Walter Huston]], \"He's probably the only performer in Hollywood to whom I'd gladly lose a scene\".<ref>Sperber and Lax 1997, p. 343.</ref>\n\nThe film was shot in the heat of summer for greater realism and atmosphere, proving grueling to make.<ref name=Meyers_p227>{{Harvnb|Meyers|1997|p=227.}}</ref> [[James Agee]] wrote, \"Bogart does a wonderful job with this character&nbsp;... miles ahead of the very good work he has done before\". John Huston won the [[Academy Award for Best Director]] and screenplay and his father won [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]], but the film had mediocre box office results. Bogart complained, \"An intelligent script, beautifully directed\u2014something different\u2014and the public turned a cold shoulder on it\".<ref name=Meyers_p229-230>{{Harvnb|Meyers|1997|pp=229\u2013230.}}</ref>\n\n=== House Un-American Activities Committee ===\nBogart, a liberal [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]],<ref>Porter 2003, p. 9.</ref> organized a delegation to Washington, D.C., called the [[Committee for the First Amendment]], against what he perceived to be the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]]'s harassment of Hollywood screenwriters and actors. He subsequently wrote an article \"I'm No Communist\" in the March 1948 edition of ''[[Photoplay]]'' magazine in which he distanced himself from [[Hollywood blacklist|The Hollywood Ten]] to counter the negative publicity resulting from his appearance. Bogart wrote: \"The ten men cited for contempt by the House Un-American Activities Committee were not defended by us.\"<ref>Bogart, Humphrey. [http://www.oldmagazinearticles.com/1948-Humphrey_Bogart_on_Hollywood_Blacklist_editorial_pdf \"I'm no Communist.\"] ''Photoplay'', March 1948.</ref>\n\n=== Santana Productions ===\nIn 1948, Bogart created his film studio, [[Santana Productions]] (named after his yacht with the cabin cruiser in ''Key Largo'').<ref name=Meyers_p236>{{Harvnb|Meyers|1997|p=236.}}</ref> Earning the right to create his own company had left Jack Warner furious, and afraid other stars would do the same and further erode the major studios' power. In addition to the pressure they were bearing from freelancing actors like Bogart, [[James Stewart]], [[Henry Fonda]] and others, they were beginning to buckle from the eroding impact of television and enforcement of anti-trust laws breaking up theater chains.<ref name=Meyers_p235>{{Harvnb|Meyers|1997|p=235.}}</ref> Bogart performed in his final films for Warners, ''[[Chain Lightning (1950 film)|Chain Lightning]]'' (1950) and ''[[The Enforcer (1951 film)|The Enforcer]]'' (1951).\n\n[[File:LonelyPlaceTrailer.jpg|thumb|left|Dour as Dixon Steele, with ''[[In A Lonely Place]]'' co-star [[Gloria Grahame]]]]\n\nThe company released its films through [[Columbia Pictures]]. Without letting up, Bogart starred in ''[[Knock on Any Door]]'' (1949), ''[[Tokyo Joe (film)|Tokyo Joe]]'' (1949), ''[[In a Lonely Place]]'' (1950), ''[[Sirocco (film)|Sirocco]]'' (1951) and ''[[Beat the Devil (film)|Beat the Devil]]'' (1953). Santana made two other films without him: ''[[And Baby Makes Three]]'' (1949) and ''[[The Family Secret (1951 film)|The Family Secret]]'' (1951).\n\nWhile the majority lost money at the box office, ultimately forcing Santana's sale, at least two are well remembered today: ''In a Lonely Place'' is considered by many a high point in film noir. Bogart plays embittered writer Dixon Steele, whose history of violence lands him as top suspect in a murder case. At the same time he falls in love with an alluring but failed actress played by [[Gloria Grahame]]. It is considered among his best performances,<ref>{{Rotten-tomatoes|id=in_a_lonely_place|title=In a Lonely Place}}</ref> and many Bogart biographers and actress/writer Louise Brooks feel the role is the closest to the real Bogart of any he played. She wrote that the film \"gave him a role that he could play with complexity, because the film character's pride in his art, his selfishness, drunkenness, lack of energy stabbed with lightning strokes of violence were shared by the real Bogart\". The character even mimics some of Bogart's personal habits, including twice ordering Bogart's favorite meal of ham and eggs.<ref name=Meyers_p240-241>{{Harvnb|Meyers|1997|pp=240\u2013241.}}</ref>\n\nSomething of a parody of ''The Maltese Falcon'', ''Beat the Devil'' was their final film for Bogart and [[John Huston]]. Co-written by [[Truman Capote]], the eccentrically filmed tale follows an amoral group of rogues chasing an unattainable treasure.<ref>Sperber and Lax 1997, p. 471.</ref> Bogart sold his interest in Santana to Columbia for over $1&nbsp;million in 1955.<ref name=Meyers_p243>{{Harvnb|Meyers|1997|p=243.}}</ref>\n\n=== ''The African Queen'' ===\n[[File:Hepburn bogart african queen.png|thumb|With [[Katharine Hepburn]] in a promotional image for ''[[The African Queen (film)|The African Queen]]'']]\nWorking outside of his own Santana Productions, Bogart starred with [[Katharine Hepburn]] in the John Huston directed ''[[The African Queen (film)|The African Queen]]'' in 1951. The [[C. S. Forester|C.S. Forester]] novel on which it was based was overlooked and left undeveloped for fifteen years until producer [[Sam Spiegel]] and Huston bought the rights. Spiegel sent Katharine Hepburn the book and she suggested Bogart for the male lead, firmly believing that \"he was the only man who could have played that part\".<ref>Sperber and Lax 1997, p. 439.</ref> Huston's love of adventure, deep, longstanding friendship\u2013and success\u2013with Bogart, and a chance to work with Hepburn, convinced the actor to leave the comfortable confines of Hollywood for a difficult shoot on location in the [[Belgian Congo]] in Africa. Bogart was to get 30 percent of the profits and Hepburn 10 percent, plus a relatively small salary for both. The stars met up in London and announced the happy prospect of working together.\n\nBacall came for the four-month-plus duration, leaving their young child to be cared for in L.A. The Bogarts started the trip with a junket through Europe, including a visit with [[Pope Pius XII]].<ref name=Meyers_p248>{{Harvnb|Meyers|1997|p=248.}}</ref>  Later, the glamor would be gone and Bacall would make herself useful as a cook, nurse and clothes washer, earning her husband's praise: \"I don't know what we'd have done without her. She [[Lux (soap)|Luxed]] my undies in darkest Africa\".<ref name=Meyers_p249>{{Harvnb|Meyers|1997|p=249.}}</ref>  Just about everyone in the cast came down with [[dysentery]] except Bogart and Huston, who subsisted on canned food and alcohol. Bogart explained: \"All I ate was baked beans, canned [[asparagus]] and [[Scotch whisky]]. Whenever a fly bit Huston or me, it dropped dead.\"<ref>Sperber and Lax 1997, p. 444.</ref> Hepburn, a [[Teetotalism|teetotaler]] in and out of character, fared worse in the difficult conditions, losing weight and at one point falling very ill. Bogart resisted Huston's insistence on using real [[leech]]es in a key scene where Charlie has to drag his steam launch through an infested marsh, until reasonable fakes were employed.<ref>Sperber and Lax 1997, p. 447.</ref> In the end, the crew overcame illness, soldier ant invasions, leaking boats, poor food, attacking [[hippopotamus|hippos]], poor water filters, fierce heat, isolation, and a boat fire to complete a memorable film.<ref>Sperber and Lax 1997, pp. 444\u2013445.</ref> Despite the discomfort of jumping from the boat into swamps, rivers and marshes the film apparently rekindled Bogart's early love of boats. On his return to California he bought a classic mahogany [[Hacker-Craft]] runabout, which he kept until his death.\n\nThe role of cantankerous skipper Charlie Allnutt won Bogart his only [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] in three nominations, for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor in a Leading Role]] in 1951. Bogart considered his performance to be the best of his film career.<ref name=Meyers_p258>{{Harvnb|Meyers|1997|p=258.}}</ref>  He had vowed to friends that if he won, his speech would break the convention of thanking everyone in sight. He advised [[Claire Trevor]], when she had been nominated for ''[[Key Largo (film)|Key Largo]]'', to \"just say you did it all yourself and don't thank anyone\". But when Bogart won the Academy Award, which he truly coveted despite his well-advertised disdain for Hollywood, he said \"It's a long way from the Belgian Congo to the stage of this theatre. It's nicer to be here. Thank you very much&nbsp;... No one does it alone. As in tennis, you need a good opponent or partner to bring out the best in you. John and Katie helped me to be where I am now\". Despite the thrilling win and the recognition, Bogart later commented, \"The way to survive an Oscar is never to try to win another one&nbsp;... too many stars&nbsp;... win it and then figure they have to top themselves&nbsp;... they become afraid to take chances. The result: A lot of dull performances in dull pictures\".<ref name=Meyers_p259-260>{{Harvnb|Meyers|1997|pp=259\u2013260.}}</ref>\n\n''The African Queen'' marked the first [[Technicolor]] film starring Bogart. He appeared in relatively few color films of any kind during the rest of his career, which continued for another five years.\n\n=== Final roles ===\nBogart dropped his asking price to get the role of Captain Queeg in [[Edward Dmytryk]]'s 1954 drama ''[[The Caine Mutiny (film)|The Caine Mutiny]]''. Though he griped with some of his old bitterness about having to do so,<ref>Sperber and Lax 1997, p. 480.</ref> he delivered a strong performance in the lead, earning him his final Oscar nomination as well as being the subject of the cover story in the June 7, 1954 issue of ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]''.  Yet for all his success, Bogart was still his [[Depression (mood)|melancholy]] old self, grumbling and feuding with the studio, while his health was beginning to deteriorate. The character of Queeg mirrored in some ways those Bogart had played in ''The Maltese Falcon'', ''Casablanca'' and ''The Big Sleep''\u2013the wary loner who trusts no one\u2014but without either the warmth or humor of those roles. Like his portrayal of Fred C. Dobbs in ''The Treasure of the Sierra Madre'', Bogart played a paranoid, self-pitying character whose small-mindedness eventually destroyed him. Three months before the film's release, Bogart appeared as Queeg on the cover of ''TIME'' magazine, while on Broadway [[Henry Fonda]] was starring in the stage version (in a different role), both of which generated strong publicity for the film.<ref name=Meyers_p279-280>{{Harvnb|Meyers|1997|pp=279\u2013280.}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Sabrina8.jpg|thumb|Bogart and Hepburn]]\nIn ''[[Sabrina (1954 film)|Sabrina]]'', [[Billy Wilder]] wished to cast [[Cary Grant]] as the older male lead. However, he chose Bogart to play the elder, conservative brother who competes with his younger playboy sibling ([[William Holden]]) for the affection of the Cinderella-like Sabrina ([[Audrey Hepburn]]). Bogart was lukewarm about the part, but agreed to it on a handshake with Wilder, sans finished script but with the director's assurances he would take good care of Bogart during the filming.<ref name=Meyers_p281>{{Harvnb|Meyers|1997|p=281.}}</ref> Nevertheless, Bogart got on poorly with his director and co-stars. He complained about the script and its last-minute drafting and delivery, and accused Wilder of favoring Hepburn and Holden on and off the set. At the root was Wilder being the opposite of Bogart's ideal director, John Huston, in both style and personality. Bogart groused to the press that Wilder was \"overbearing\" and \"is the kind of [[Prussia]]n German with a riding crop. He is the type of director I don't like to work with&nbsp;... the picture is a crock of crap. I got sick and tired of who gets Sabrina.\"<ref name=Meyers_p283>{{Harvnb|Meyers|1997|p=283.}}</ref>  Wilder later claimed, \"We parted as enemies but finally made up.\" Despite the acrimony, the film was successful. ''[[The New York Times]]'' crowed that Bogart was \"incredibly adroit&nbsp;... the skill with which this old rock-ribbed actor blends the gags and such duplicities with a manly manner of melting is one of the incalculable joys of the show.\"<ref>Sperber and Lax 1997, p. 495.</ref>\n\n[[File:Humphrey Bogart in The Barefoot Contessa trailer.jpg|left|thumb|Bogart in ''[[The Barefoot Contessa]]'']]\n\n[[Joseph L. Mankiewicz]]'s 1954 film, ''[[The Barefoot Contessa]]'', was filmed in [[Rome]]. In this Hollywood back-story Bogart is again a broken-down man, the cynical director-narrator who saves his career by making a star of a [[flamenco]] dancer modeled on real life film sex goddess [[Rita Hayworth]]. Bogart was uneasy with [[Ava Gardner]] in the female lead, as she had just split from close \"[[Rat Pack]]\" buddy [[Frank Sinatra]] and was carrying on an affair with bullfighter [[Luis Miguel Domingu\u00edn]]. Bogart told her, \"Half the world's female population would throw themselves at Frank's feet and here you are flouncing around with guys who wear capes and little ballerina slippers.\" He was also annoyed by her inexperienced performance. Later, Gardner credited Bogart with helping her both on and offscreen. Bogart's performance was generally praised as the strongest part of the film.<ref name=Meyers_p288-290>{{Harvnb|Meyers|1997|pp=288\u2013290.}}</ref> During the filming, while Bacall was home, Bogart resumed his discreet affair with [[Verita Bouvaire-Thompson]], his long-time studio assistant, whom he took sailing and enjoyed drinking with. When his wife suddenly arrived on the scene discovering them together, she took it quite well, extracting an expensive shopping spree from her husband, the three traveling together after the shooting.<ref name=Meyers_p291-292>{{Harvnb|Meyers|1997|pp=291\u2013292.}}</ref>\n\nBogart could be generous with actors, particularly those who were blacklisted, down on their luck, or having personal problems. During the filming of the [[Edward Dmytryk]] directed ''[[The Left Hand of God]]'' (1955), he noticed his co-star [[Gene Tierney]] having a hard time remembering her lines and behaving oddly. He coached Tierney, feeding her lines. He was familiar with mental illness from his sister's bouts of depression, and encouraged Tierney to seek treatment.<ref>\"Gene Tierney: A Shattered Portrait\". ''The Biography Channel''. Airdate: March 26, 1999.</ref><ref>Tierney and Herskowitz 1978, pp. 164\u2013165.</ref> He also stood behind [[Joan Bennett]] and insisted on her as his co-star in [[Michael Curtiz]]'s ''[[We're No Angels (1955 film)|We're No Angels]]'' when an ugly public scandal made her [[persona non grata]] with Jack Warner.<ref>Meyers 1997, p. 294.</ref>\n\n=== Television and radio ===\n[[File:Bacall, Bogart, Fonda crop.jpg|right|thumb|Bacall, Bogart and Henry Fonda in the television version of ''The Petrified Forest'' (1955)]]\nWhile Bogart rarely performed on television, he and Bacall appeared on [[Edward R. Murrow]]'s ''[[Person to Person]]'' in which they disagreed in answering every question. Bogart was also featured on ''[[The Jack Benny Program|The Jack Benny Show]]''. The surviving [[kinescope]] of the live telecast captures him in his only TV sketch comedy outing. Bogart and Bacall worked together on an early color telecast in 1955, an [[NBC]] adaptation of ''The Petrified Forest'' for ''[[Producers' Showcase]]'', with Bogart receiving [[Billing (filmmaking)|top billing]] and [[Henry Fonda]] playing Leslie Howard's role; a [[black and white]] kinescope of the live telecast has also survived. Bogart performed radio adaptations of some of his best known films, such as ''Casablanca'' and ''The Maltese Falcon''. He also recorded a radio series called ''[[Bold Venture]]'' with Bacall. In 1995, newly developed digital technology allowed Bogart's image to be inserted in the ''[[Tales from the Crypt (TV series)|Tales from the Crypt]]'' television episode \"You, Murderer\" as one of its many ''Casablanca'' references. The \"Ingrid Bergman\" character was played by her daughter [[Isabella Rossellini]].\n\n== Personal life ==\n[[File:Humphrey Bogart and Mike Lane 1956.jpg|thumb|upright|Bogart and [[Mike Lane]] in ''[[The Harder They Fall]]'']]\n\n=== Rat Pack ===\nBogart was a founding member and the original leader of the so-called Hollywood [[Rat Pack]]. In the spring of 1955, after a long party in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] attended by [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Judy Garland]], her husband [[Sidney Luft]], [[Michael Romanoff]] and wife Gloria, [[David Niven]], [[Angie Dickinson]] and others, Bacall surveyed the wreckage and declared, \"You look like a goddamn rat pack.\"<ref name=\"sperber p. 504.\">Sperber and Lax 1997, p. 504.</ref>\n\nThe name stuck and was made official at Romanoff's in [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]].

In 1955, though he was well established as an independent producer, his health was failing. In the wake of Santana, Bogart had formed a new company and had eager plans for a film, ''[[John P. Marquand#Popular fiction|Melville Goodwin]], U.S.A.'', in which he would play a general, and Bacall a press magnate. However, his persistent cough and difficulty eating became too serious to ignore, and he dropped the project.<ref>The film was subsequently renamed ''Top Secret Affair'' and made with Kirk Douglas and Susan Hayward: Sperber and Lax 1997, pp. 509\u2013510.</ref>\n\nAs a heavy smoker and drinker, Bogart developed [[esophageal cancer]]. He did not speak of his health and visited a doctor in January 1956, after much persistence from Bacall. The disease worsened several weeks later. On March 1, 1956, he underwent a surgical operation in which his entire [[esophagus]], two [[lymph node]]s and a rib were removed. However, the surgery failed, even with [[chemotherapy]].<ref>Sperber and Lax 1997, p. 510.</ref> Bogart underwent corrective surgery in November 1956, when the cancer had spread.<ref name=\"shickelbook\" /> With time, he grew too weak to walk up and down stairs, fighting the pain yet still able to joke: \"Put me in the [[dumbwaiter]] and I'll ride down to the first floor in style.\" It was then altered to accommodate his wheelchair.<ref>Bacall 1978, p. 273.</ref> Sinatra, Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy visited Bogart on January 13, 1957. In an interview, Hepburn said:\n\n{{quote|Spence patted him on the shoulder and said, \"Goodnight, Bogie.\" Bogie turned his eyes to Spence very quietly and with a sweet smile covered Spence's hand with his own and said, \"Goodbye, Spence.\" Spence's heart stood still. He understood.<ref>Sperber and Lax 1997, p. 516.</ref> }}\n\nBogart fell into a coma and died on the next day. He had just turned 57 twenty days prior and weighed only {{convert|80|lb|kg}}. His simple funeral was held at All Saints Episcopal Church, with musical selections from favorite composers [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] and [[Claude Debussy]].

Bacall asked Tracy to give the eulogy, but he was too upset, so John Huston spoke instead. He reminded the gathered mourners about Bogart:\n\n{{quote|Himself, he never took too seriously\u2014his work most seriously. He regarded the somewhat gaudy figure of Bogart, the star, with an amused cynicism; Bogart, the actor, he held in deep respect&nbsp;... In each of the fountains at Versailles there is a pike which keeps all the carp active; otherwise they would grow overfat and die. Bogie took rare delight in performing a similar duty in the fountains of Hollywood. Yet his victims seldom bore him any malice, and when they did, not for long. His shafts were fashioned only to stick into the outer layer of complacency, and not to penetrate through to the regions of the spirit where real injuries are done&nbsp;... He is quite irreplaceable. There will never be another like him.<ref>Sperber and Lax 1997, p. 518.</ref> }}\n\nBogart's cremated remains were interred in [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale)|Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery]], [[Glendale, California]], in the Garden of Memory, Columbarium of Eternal Light.

On it was inscribed an allusion to a line from the film ''To Have and Have Not'', which Bacall had said to him shortly after their first meeting: \"You know how to whistle, don't you, Steve?

History paintings usually depict a moment in a narrative story, rather than a specific and static subject, as in a portrait.  The term is derived from the wider senses of the word ''historia'' in Latin and Italian, meaning  \"story\" or \"narrative\", and essentially means \"story painting\". Most history paintings are not of scenes from [[history]], especially paintings from before about 1850.\n\nIn modern English, historical painting is sometimes used to describe the painting of scenes from history in its narrower sense, especially for 19th-century art, excluding religious, mythological and allegorical subjects, which are included in the broader term history painting, and before the 19th century were the most common subjects for history paintings.\n\nHistory paintings almost always contain a number of figures, often a large number, and normally show some type of action that is a moment in a narrative. The genre includes depictions of moments in religious narratives, above all the ''[[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]]'', as well as narrative scenes from [[mythology]], and also [[allegorical]] scenes.<ref>[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/glossary/history-painting National Gallery, Glossary entry]; [http://www.nga.gov/collection/gallery/gg61/gg61-main1.html History Painting Gallery] from The National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC; Green and Seddon, 7-8; Harrison, 105-106</ref> These groups were for long the most frequently painted; works such as [[Michelangelo]]'s [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]] are therefore history paintings, as are most very large paintings before the 19th century. The term covers large paintings in [[oil on canvas]] or [[fresco]] produced between the Renaissance and the late 19th century, after which the term is generally not used even for the many works that still meet the basic definition.<ref>Green and Seddon, 11-15</ref>\n\nHistory painting may be used interchangeably with '''historical painting''', and was especially so used before the 20th century.<ref>{{cite web|title=History painting|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/History+painting|work=Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary|publisher=The Free Dictionary}}</ref>  Where a distinction is made \"historical painting\" is the painting of scenes from secular history, whether specific episodes or generalized scenes.  In the 19th century historical painting in this sense became a distinct genre. In phrases such as \"historical painting materials\", \"historical\" means in use before about 1900, or some earlier date.\n\nHistory paintings were traditionally regarded as the highest form of Western painting, occupying the most prestigious place in the [[hierarchy of genres]], and considered the equivalent to the [[epic (genre)|epic]] in literature. In his  ''[[De Pictura]]'' of 1436, [[Leon Battista Alberti]] had argued that multi-figure history painting was the noblest form of art, as being the most difficult, which required mastery of all the others, because it was a visual form of history, and because it had the greatest potential to move the viewer. He placed emphasis on the ability to depict the interactions between the figures by gesture and expression.<ref>Blunt, 11-12; Barlow, 1</ref>\n\nThis view remained general until the 19th century, when artistic movements began to struggle against the establishment institutions of [[academic art]], which continued to adhere to it. At the same time there was from the latter part of the 18th century an increased interest in depicting in the form of history painting moments of drama from recent or contemporary history, which had long largely been confined to [[military art|battle-scenes]] and scenes of formal surrenders and the like. Scenes from ancient history had been popular in the [[early Renaissance]], and once again became common in the [[Baroque]] and [[Rococo]] periods, and still more so with the rise of [[Neoclassicism]]. In some 19th or 20th century contexts, the term may refer specifically to paintings of scenes from secular history, rather than those from religious narratives, literature or mythology.\n\n[[File:Jacques-Louis David - Oath of the Horatii - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Jacques-Louis David]]'s ''[[Oath of the Horatii]]'', 1786, with a scene from ancient history.]]\n\n==Development==\nThe term is generally not used in art history in speaking of medieval painting, although the Western tradition was developing in large [[altarpiece]]s, fresco cycles, and other works, as well as [[miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]] in [[illuminated manuscripts]]. It comes to the fore in [[Italian Renaissance painting]], where a series of increasingly ambitious works were produced, many still religious, but several, especially in Florence, which did actually feature near-contemporary historical scenes such as the set of three huge canvases on ''[[The Battle of San Romano]]'' by [[Paolo Uccello]], the abortive ''[[Battle of Cascina (Michelangelo)|Battle of Cascina]]'' by Michelangelo and the ''[[The Battle of Anghiari (painting)|Battle of Anghiari]]'' by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], neither of which were completed. Scenes from ancient history and mythology were also popular. Writers such as Alberti and the following century [[Giorgio Vasari]] in his ''[[Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects|Lives of the Artists]]'', followed public and artistic opinion in judging the best painters above all on their production of large works of history painting (though in fact the only modern (post-classical) work described in ''[[De Pictura]]'' is [[Giotto]]'s huge ''[[Navicella (mosaic)|Navicella]]'' in mosaic).  Artists continued for centuries to strive to make their reputation by producing such works, often neglecting genres to which their talents were better suited.\n[[File:Leo the Great and Attila by Raffael.png|thumb|right|''[[The Meeting of Leo the Great and Attila]]'' by [[Raphael]] and his workshop]]\n[[File:Angelo Bronzino 001.jpg|thumb|''[[Venus, Cupid, Folly and Time]]'', [[Agnolo Bronzino]], c. 1545. According to [[Andr\u00e9 F\u00e9libien]] allegory was the highest form of all history painting.]]\n\nThere was some objection to the term, as many writers preferred terms such as \"poetic painting\" (''poesia''), or wanted to make a distinction between the \"true\" ''istoria'', covering history including biblical and religious scenes, and the ''fabula'', covering pagan myth, allegory, and scenes from fiction, which could not be regarded as true.<ref>See Reynolds below; nonetheless he bowed to convention: \"In conformity to custom, I call this part of the art history painting; it ought to be called poetical, as in reality it is.\" (''Discources'', IV); for debates over terminology in the Italian Renaissance, see Bull, 391-394</ref> The large works of [[Raphael]] were long considered, with those of Michelangelo, as the finest models for the genre.\n\nIn the [[Raphael Rooms]] in the [[Vatican Palace]], allegories and historical scenes are mixed together, and the [[Raphael Cartoons]] show scenes from the Gospels, all in the [[Grand Manner]] that from the [[High Renaissance]] became associated with, and often expected in, history painting. In the Late Renaissance and [[Baroque]] the painting of actual history tended to degenerate into panoramic battle-scenes with the victorious monarch or general perched on a horse accompanied with his retinue, or formal scenes of ceremonies, although some artists managed to make a masterpiece from such unpromising material, as [[Vel\u00e1zquez]] did with his ''[[The Surrender of Breda]]''.\n\nAn influential formulation of the hierarchy of genres, confirming the history painting at the top, was made in 1667 by [[Andr\u00e9 F\u00e9libien]], a historiographer, architect and theoretician of French classicism became the classic statement of the theory for the 18th century:<blockquote>Celui qui fait parfaitement des pa\u00efsages est au-dessus d'un autre qui ne fait que des fruits, des fleurs ou des coquilles. Celui qui peint des animaux vivants est plus estimable que ceux qui ne repr\u00e9sentent que des choses mortes & sans mouvement ; & comme la figure de l'homme est le plus parfait ouvrage de Dieu sur la Terre, il est certain aussi que celui qui se rend l'imitateur de Dieu en peignant des figures humaines, est beaucoup plus excellent que tous les autres ... un Peintre qui ne fait que des portraits, n'a pas encore cette haute perfection de l'Art, & ne peut pr\u00e9tendre \u00e0 l'honneur que re\u00e7oivent les plus s\u00e7avans. Il faut pour cela passer d'une seule figure \u00e0 la repr\u00e9sentation de plusieurs ensemble ; il faut traiter l'histoire & la fable ; il faut repr\u00e9senter de grandes actions comme les historiens, ou des sujets agr\u00e9ables comme les Po\u00ebtes ; & montant encore plus haut, il faut par des compositions all\u00e9goriques, s\u00e7avoir couvrir sous le voile de la fable les vertus des grands hommes, & les myst\u00e8res les plus relevez.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=jl8IAeoj-7IC&lpg=PA96&dq=Hierarchy%20of%20genres%20painting&lr=&as_brr=3&pg=PA97#v=onepage&q=Hierarchy%20of%20genres%20painting&f=false Books.google.co.uk], translation</ref></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>He who produces perfect landscapes is above another who only produces fruit, flowers or seashells. He who paints living animals is more than those who only represent dead things without movement, and as man is the most perfect work of God on the earth, it is also certain that he who becomes an imitator of God in representing human figures, is much more excellent than all the others ... a painter who only does portraits still does not have the highest perfection of his art, and cannot expect the honour due to the most skilled. For that he must pass from representing a single figure to several together; history and myth must be depicted; great events must be represented as by historians, or like the poets, subjects that will please, and climbing still higher, he must have the skill to cover under the veil of myth the virtues of great men in allegories, and the mysteries they reveal\".</blockquote>\n\nBy the late 18th century, with both religious and mytholological painting in decline, there was an increased demand for paintings of scenes from history, including contemporary history. This was in part driven by the changing audience for ambitious paintings, which now increasingly made their reputation in public exhibitions rather than by impressing the owners of and visitors to palaces and public buildings. Classical history remained popular, but scenes from national histories were often the best-received. From 1760 onwards, the [[Society of Artists of Great Britain]], the first body to organize regular exhibitions in London, awarded two generous prizes each year to paintings of subjects from British history.<ref>Strong, 17, and 32-34 and generally on growth of historical painting.</ref> \n[[Image:Benjamin West 005.jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[Benjamin West]], ''[[The Death of General Wolfe]]'' (1770), an early example of the vogue for painting scenes from recent history.]]\n\nThe unheroic nature of modern dress was regarded as a serious difficulty. When, in 1770, [[Benjamin West]] proposed to paint ''[[The Death of General Wolfe]]'' in contemporary dress, he was firmly instructed to use classical costume by many people. He ignored these comments and showed the scene in modern dress. Although [[George III]] refused to purchase the work, West succeeded both in overcoming his critics' objections and inaugurating a more historically accurate style in such paintings.<ref>Rothenstein, 16-17; Strong, 24-26</ref> Other artists depicted scenes, regardless of when they occurred, in classical dress and for a long time, especially during the [[French Revolution]], history painting often focused on depictions of the heroic male nude.\n\nThe large production, using the finest French artists, of propaganda paintings glorifying the exploits of [[Napoleon]], were matched by works, showing both victories and losses, from the anti-Napoleonic alliance by artists such as [[Goya]] and [[J.M.W. Turner]]. [[Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault]]'s ''[[The Raft of the Medusa]]'' (1818\u20131819) was a sensation, appearing to update the history painting for the 19th century, and showing anonymous figures famous only for being victims of what was then a famous and controversial disaster at sea. Conveniently their clothes had been worn away to classical-seeming rags by the point the painting depicts. At the same time the demand for traditional large religious history paintings very largely fell away.\n[[File:David Wilkie Chelsea Pensioners Reading the Waterloo Dispatch.jpg|thumb|300px|[[David Wilkie (artist)|Sir David Wilkie]], ''[[The Chelsea Pensioners reading the Waterloo Dispatch]]'', 1822. Genre or history painting? The types have merged, in a way typical of the 19th century.]]\n\nIn the mid-nineteenth century there arose a style known as [[historicism (art)|historicism]], which marked a formal imitation of historical styles and/or artists. Another development in the nineteenth century was the treatment of historical subjects, often on a large scale, with the values of [[Genre works|genre painting]], the depiction of scenes of everyday life, and [[anecdote]]. Grand depictions of events of great public importance were supplemented with scenes depicting more personal incidents in the lives of the great, or of scenes centred on unnamed figures involved in historical events, as in the [[Troubadour style]]. At the same time scenes of ordinary life with moral, political or satirical content became often the main vehicle for expressive interplay between figures in painting, whether given a modern or historical setting.\n\nBy the later 19th century, history painting was often explicitly rejected by [[avant-garde]] movements such as the [[Impressionism|Impressionists]] (except for [[\u00c9douard Manet]]) and the [[Symbolist]]s, and according to one recent writer \"[[Modernism]] was to a considerable extent built upon the rejection of History Painting... All other genres are deemed capable of entering, in one form or another, the 'pantheon' of modernity considered, but History Painting is excluded\".<ref>Barlow, 1</ref>\n\n==History painting and historical painting==\n[[File:Past and Present Number One.jpg|thumb|left|\"No. 1, Misfortune\" from [[Augustus Egg]]'s ''[[Past and Present (paintings)|Past and Present]]'', 1858. The husband has discovered his wife's infidelity. ''Prayer'' and ''Despair'' complete the set.]]\n\n===The terms===\nInitially, \"history painting\" and \"historical painting\" were used interchangeably in English, as when Sir [[Joshua Reynolds]] in his fourth ''Discourse'' uses both indiscriminately to cover \"history painting\", while saying \"...it ought to be called poetical, as in reality it is\", reflecting the French term ''peinture historique'', one equivalent of \"history painting\".  The terms began to separate in the 19th century, with \"historical painting\" becoming a sub-group of \"history painting\" restricted to subjects taken from history in its normal sense.  In 1853 [[John Ruskin]] asked his audience: \"What do you at present ''mean'' by historical painting? Now-a-days it means the endeavour, by the power of imagination, to portray some historical event of past days.\"<ref>Lecture IV, p. 172, ''Lectures on Architecture and Painting: Delivered at Edinburgh, in November, 1853'', 1854, Wiley, [https://books.google.com/books?id=qKsaAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA172&dq=%22historical+painting%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=lxuvUePlD4Pu0gXYk4CwBA&ved=0CEQQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&q=%22historical%20painting%22&f=false google books].</ref>  So for example [[Harold Wethey]]'s three-volume catalogue of the paintings of [[Titian]] (Phaidon, 1969\u201375) is divided between \"Religious Paintings\", \"Portraits\", and \"Mythological and Historical Paintings\", though both volumes I and III cover what is included in the term \"History Paintings\".  This distinction is useful but is by no means generally observed, and the terms are still often used in a confusing manner. Because of the potential for confusion modern academic writing tends to avoid the phrase \"historical painting\", talking instead of \"historical subject matter\" in history painting, but where the phrase is still used in contemporary scholarship it will normally mean the painting of subjects from history, very often in the 19th century.<ref>As shown in the usages in Barlow, Strong, and Wright</ref>  \"Historical painting\" may also be used, especially in discussion of painting techniques in conservation studies, to mean \"old\", as opposed to modern or recent painting.<ref>As in \"The beautifully renovated Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam will open its doors to the public in 2013. To celebrate this event the Rijksmuseum will host a three-day symposium on Historical Painting Techniques. The central theme of the symposium will be the technical study of historically used painting techniques, the historical painting materials, their origin and trade, and their application in the painter\u2019s workshop.\" [https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/research-and-library/painting-techniques Rijksmuseum, \"Painting Techniques - Call for Papers\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531094855/https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/research-and-library/painting-techniques |date=2013-05-31 }}</ref>\n\nIn 19th-century British writing on art the terms \"'''subject painting'''\" or \"anecdotic\" painting were often used for works in a line of development going back to [[William Hogarth]] of monoscenic depictions of crucial moments in an implied narrative with unidentified characters,<ref>{{cite book|author=Pamela M.

During the Revolutionary and Napoleonic periods the heroic treatment of contemporary history in a frankly propagandistic fashion by [[Antoine-Jean, Baron Gros]], [[Jacques-Louis David]], [[Carle Vernet]] and others was supported by the French state, but after the fall of Napoleon in 1815 the French governments were not regarded as suitable for heroic treatment and many artists retreated further into the past to find subjects, though in Britain depicting the victories of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] mostly occurred after they were over.  Another path was to choose contemporary subjects that were oppositional to government either at home and abroad, and many of what were arguably the last great generation of history paintings were protests at contemporary episodes of repression or outrages at home or abroad: [[Goya]]'s ''[[The Third of May 1808]]'' (1814), [[Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault]]'s ''[[The Raft of the Medusa]]'' (1818\u201319), [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix]]'s ''[[The Massacre at Chios]]'' (1824) and ''[[Liberty Leading the People]]'' (1830).  These were heroic, but showed heroic suffering by ordinary civilians.\n[[File:PAUL DELAROCHE - Ejecuci\u00f3n de Lady Jane Grey (National Gallery de Londres, 1834).jpg|thumb|[[Paul Delaroche]], ''[[The Execution of Lady Jane Grey]]'', 1833, [[National Gallery]], London]]\n\n[[Romanticism|Romantic artists]] such as G\u00e9ricault and Delacroix, and those from other movements such as the English [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]] continued to regard history painting as the ideal for their most ambitious works. Others such as [[Jan Matejko]] in Poland, [[Vasily Surikov]] in Russia, and [[Paul Delaroche]] in France became specialized painters of large historical subjects.  The ''[[style troubadour]]'' (\"[[troubadour]] style\") was a somewhat derisive French term for earlier paintings of medieval and Renaissance scenes, which were often small and depicting moments of anecdote rather than drama; [[Ingres]], [[Richard Parkes Bonington]] and  [[Henri Jean-Baptiste Victoire Fradelle|Henri Fradelle]] painted such works. Sir [[Roy Strong]] calls this type of work the \"Intimate Romantic\", and in French it was known as the \"peinture de genre historique\" or \"peinture anecdotique\" (\"historical genre painting\" or \"anecdotal painting\").<ref>Strong, 36-40; Wright, 269-273, French terms on p. 269</ref>\n\nChurch commissions for large group scenes from the Bible had greatly reduced, and historical painting became very significant.

A hyperbola has two pieces, called [[connected component (graph theory)|connected component]]s or branches, that are mirror images of each other and resemble two infinite [[bow (weapon)|bows]].  The hyperbola is one of the three kinds of [[conic section]], formed by the intersection of a [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] and a double [[cone (geometry)|cone]].  (The other conic sections are the [[parabola]] and the [[ellipse]]. A [[circle]] is a special case of an ellipse.) If the plane intersects both halves of the double cone but does not pass through the apex of the cones, then the conic is a hyperbola.\n\nHyperbolas arise in many ways: \n* as the curve representing the function <math>f(x) = 1/x</math> in the [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian plane]],\n* as the path followed by the shadow of the tip of a [[sundial]],\n* as the shape of an [[open orbit]] (as distinct from a closed elliptical orbit), such as the orbit of a [[spacecraft]] during a [[gravity assist]]ed swing-by of a planet or more generally any spacecraft exceeding the [[escape velocity]] of the nearest planet,\n* as the path of a single-apparition [[comet]] (one travelling too fast ever to return to the solar system),\n* as the [[Rutherford scattering|scattering trajectory]] of a [[subatomic particle]] (acted on by repulsive instead of attractive forces but the principle is the same),\n* in [[hyperbolic navigation|radio navigation]], when the difference between distances to two points, but not the distances themselves, can be determined,\nand so on.\n\nEach [[branch (mathematics)|branch]] of the hyperbola has two arms which become straighter (lower curvature) further out from the center of the hyperbola. Diagonally opposite arms, one from each branch, tend in the limit to a common line, called the [[asymptote]] of those two arms. So there are two asymptotes, whose intersection is at the center of [[symmetry]] of the hyperbola, which can be thought of as the mirror point about which each branch reflects to form the other branch. In the case of the curve <math>f(x) = 1/x</math> the asymptotes are the two [[coordinate axes]].\n\nHyperbolas share many of the ellipses' analytical properties such as [[eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity]], [[focus (geometry)|focus]], and [[directrix (conic section)|directrix]]. Typically the correspondence can be made with nothing more than a change of sign in some term. Many other [[mathematical object]]s have their origin in the hyperbola, such as [[hyperbolic paraboloid]]s (saddle surfaces), [[hyperboloid]]s (\"wastebaskets\"), [[hyperbolic geometry]] ([[Nikolai Lobachevsky|Lobachevsky]]'s celebrated [[non-Euclidean geometry]]), [[hyperbolic function]]s (sinh, cosh, tanh, etc.), and [[gyrovector space]]s (a geometry proposed for use in both [[theory of relativity|relativity]] and [[quantum mechanics]] which is not [[Euclidean geometry|Euclidean]]).\n\n==Etymology and history==\nThe word \"hyperbola\" derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u1f51\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b2\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae}}, meaning \"over-thrown\" or \"excessive\", from which the English term [[hyperbole]] also derives. Hyperbolae were discovered by [[Menaechmus]] in his investigations of the problem of [[doubling the cube]], but were then called sections of obtuse cones.<ref>{{citation |title=Apollonius of Perga: Treatise on Conic Sections with Introductions Including an Essay on Earlier History on the Subject |first=Sir Thomas Little |last=Heath |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1896 |contribution=Chapter I.

The rectangle could be \"applied\" to the segment (meaning, have an equal length), be shorter than the segment or exceed the segment.<ref>{{citation|pages=30\u201331|first=Howard|last=Eves|title=A Survey of Geometry (Vol. One)|year=1963|publisher=Allyn and Bacon}}</ref>\n\n== Definition of a hyperbola as locus of points ==\n[[File:Hyperbel-def-e.svg|thumb|Hyperbola: definition by the distances of points to two fixed points (foci)]]\n[[File:Hyperbel-def-dc.svg|thumb|Hyperbola: definition with director circle]]\nA hyperbola can be defined geometrically as a set of points ([[locus of points]]) in the Euclidean plane:\n\n* A '''hyperbola''' is a set of points, such that for any point <math>P</math> of the set, the absolute difference of the distances <math>|PF_1|,\\ |PF_2|</math> to two fixed points <math>F_1,F_2</math> (the ''foci''), is  constant, usually denoted by <math>2a, \\ a>0\\ :</math>\n\n:<math>H = \\{P \\mid ||PF_2| - |PF_1 || = 2a \\}\\ .</math>\n\nThe midpoint <math>M</math> of the line segment joining the foci is called the ''center'' of the hyperbola. The line through the foci is called the ''major axis''. It contains the ''vertices'' <math>V_1,V_2</math>, which have distance  <math>a</math> to the center. The distance <math>c</math> of the foci to the center is called the ''focal distance'' or ''linear eccentricity''. The quotient <math>\\tfrac c a</math> is the ''eccentricity'' <math>e</math>.\n\nThe equation <math>||PF_2| - |PF_1 || = 2a</math> can be viewed in a different way (see diagram):<br />\nIf <math>c_2</math> is the circle with midpoint <math>F_2</math> and radius <math>2a</math>, then the distance of a point <math>P</math> of the right branch to the circle <math>c_2</math> equals the distance to the focus <math>F_1</math>:\n::<math>|PF_1|=|Pc_2|.</math>\n<math>c_2</math> is called  the ''circular directrix'' (related to focus <math>F_2</math>) of the hyperbola.<ref>{{citation|first1=Tom M.|last1=Apostol|first2=Mamikon A.|last2=Mnatsakanian|title=New Horizons in Geometry|year=2012|publisher=The Mathematical Association of America|series=The Dolciani Mathematical Expositions #47|isbn=978-0-88385-354-2|page=251}}</ref><ref>The German term for this circle is ''Leitkreis'' which can be translated as \"Director circle\", but that term has a different meaning in the English literature (see [[Director circle]]).</ref> In order to get the left branch of the hyperbola, one has to use the circular directrix related to <math>F_1</math>. This property should not be confused with the definition of a hyperbola with help of a directrix (line) below.\n\n== Hyperbola in Cartesian coordinates ==\n=== Equation ===\nIf Cartesian coordinates are introduced such that the origin is the center of the hyperbola and the ''x''-axis is the major axis, then the hyperbola is called ''east-west-opening'' and \n:the ''foci'' are the points <math>F_1=(c,0),\\ F_2=(-c,0)</math>, \n:the ''vertices'' are <math>V_1=(a, 0),\\ V_2=(-a,0)</math>.\nFor an arbitrary point <math>(x,y)</math> the distance to the focus <math>(c,0)</math> is \n<math>\\sqrt{ (x-c)^2 + y^2 }</math> and to the second focus <math>\\sqrt{ (x+c)^2 + y^2 }</math>. Hence the point <math>(x,y)</math> is on the hyperbola if the following condition is fulfilled \n:<math>\\sqrt{(x-c)^2 + y^2} - \\sqrt{(x+c)^2 + y^2} = \\pm 2a \\ .</math>\nRemove the square roots by suitable squarings and use the relation <math>b^2 = c^2-a^2</math> to obtain the equation of the hyperbola:\n\n*<math>\\frac{x^2}{a^2}-\\frac{y^2}{b^2}= 1 \\ .</math>\n\nThis equation is called the ''canonical form'' of a hyperbola, because any hyperbola, regardless of its orientation relative to the Cartesian axes and regardless of the location of its center, can be transformed to this form by a change of variables, giving a hyperbola that is [[congruence (geometry)|congruent]] to the original (see [[#Quadratic equation|below]]).\n\nThe axes of [[symmetry (geometry)|symmetry]] or ''principal axes'' are the ''transverse axis'' (containing the segment of length 2''a'' with endpoints at the vertices) and the ''conjugate axis'' (containing the segment of length 2''b'' perpendicular to the transverse axis and with midpoint at the hyperbola\u2019s center). As opposed to an ellipse, a hyperbola has only two vertices: <math>(a,0),\\; (-a,0)</math>. The two points <math>(0,b),\\; (0,-b)</math> on the conjugate axis are ''not'' on the hyperbola.\n\nIt follows from the equation that the hyperbola is ''symmetric'' with respect to both of the coordinate axes and hence symmetric with respect to the origin.\n\n====Eccentricity====\nFor a hyperbola in the above canonical form, the [[eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity]] is given by\n\n:<math>e=\\sqrt{1+\\frac{b^2}{a^2}}.</math>\n\nTwo hyperbolas are [[similarity (geometry)|geometrically similar]] to each other \u2013 meaning that they have the same shape, so that one can be transformed into the other by [[translation (mathematics)|rigid left and right movements]], [[rotation (mathematics)|rotation]], [[reflection (mathematics)|taking a mirror image]], and scaling (magnification) \u2013 if and only if they have the same eccentricity.\n\n=== Asymptotes ===\n[[File:Hyperbel-param-e.svg|250px|thumb|Hyperbola: semi-axes ''a'',''b'', linear eccentricity ''c'', semi latus rectum ''p'']]\n[[File:Hyperbola-3prop.svg|300px|thumb|Hyperbola: 3 properties]]\nSolving the equation (above) of the hyperbola for <math>y</math> yields\n:<math>y=\\pm\\frac{b}{a}\\sqrt{x^2-a^2}.</math>\nIt follows from this that the hyperbola approaches the two lines  \n*<math>y=\\pm \\frac{b}{a}x </math>\nfor large values of <math>|x|</math>.

One half of it is the ''semi-latus rectum'' <math>p</math>. A calculation shows\n*<math>p = \\frac{b^2}a.</math>\nThe semi-latus rectum <math>p</math> may also be viewed as the ''[[radius of curvature]] '' of the [[osculating circle]]s at the vertices.\n\n=== Tangent ===\nThe simplest way to determine the equation of the tangent at a point <math>(x_0,y_0)</math> is to [[Implicit differentiation|implicitly differentiate]] the equation <math>\\tfrac{x^2}{a^2}-\\tfrac{y^2}{b^2}= 1</math> of the hyperbola. Denoting ''dy/dx'' as ''y\u2032'', this produces\n:<math>\\frac{2x}{a^2}-\\frac{2yy'}{b^2}= 0 \\ \\rightarrow \\ y'=\\frac{x}{y}\\frac{b^2}{a^2}\\ \\rightarrow \\ y=\\frac{x_0}{y_0}\\frac{b^2}{a^2}(x-x_0) +y_0.</math>\nWith respect to <math>\\tfrac{x_0^2}{a^2}-\\tfrac{y_0^2}{b^2}= 1</math>, the equation of the tangent at point <math>(x_0,y_0)</math> is,\n*<math>\\frac{x_0}{a^2}x-\\frac{y_0}{b^2}y = 1.</math>\n\nA particular tangent line distinguishes the hyperbola from the other conic sections.<ref>J. W. Downs, ''Practical Conic Sections'', Dover Publ., 2003 (orig. 1993): p. 26.</ref> Let ''f'' be the distance from the vertex ''V'' (on both the hyperbola and its axis through the two foci) to the nearer focus. Then the distance, along a line perpendicular to that axis, from that focus to a point P on the hyperbola is greater than 2''f''. The tangent to the hyperbola at P intersects that axis at point Q at an angle \u2220PQV of greater than 45\u00b0.\n\n=== Rectangular hyperbola ===\nIn the case <math>a = b</math> the hyperbola is called ''rectangular'' (or ''equilateral''), because its asymptotes intersect rectangularly (i.e., are perpendicular). For this case, the linear eccentricity is <math>c=\\sqrt{2}a</math>, the eccentricity <math>e=\\sqrt{2}</math> and the semi-latus rectum <math>p=a</math>.\n\n=== Parametric representation with hyperbolic sine/cosine ===\nUsing the [[Hyperbolic function|hyperbolic sine and cosine functions]] <math>\\cosh,\\sinh</math>, a parametric representation of the hyperbola <math>\\tfrac{x^2}{a^2}-\\tfrac{y^2}{b^2}= 1</math> can be obtained, which is similar to the parametric representation of an ellipse:\n*<math>(\\pm a \\cosh t, b \\sinh t),\\, t \\in \\R \\ ,</math>\nwhich satisfies the Cartesian equation because <math>\\cosh^2 t -\\sinh^2 t =1 .</math>\n\nFurther parametric representations are given in the section [[#Parametric equations|Parametric equations]] below.\n\n[[File:Drini-conjugatehyperbolas.svg|thumb|Here {{nowrap|''a'' {{=}} ''b'' {{=}} 1}} giving the [[unit hyperbola]] in blue and its conjugate hyperbola in green, sharing the same red asymptotes.]]\n\n=== Conjugate hyperbola ===\nExchange <math>x</math> and <math>y</math> to obtain the equation of the '''conjugate hyperbola''' (see diagram):\n*<math>\\frac{y^2}{a^2}-\\frac{x^2}{b^2}= 1 \\ ,</math> also written as \n:<math>\\frac{x^2}{a^2}-\\frac{y^2}{b^2}= -1 \\ .</math>\n\n== Hyperbola with equation y=A/x ==\n[[File:Hyperbel-gs-hl.svg|thumb|Rotating the coordinate system in order to describe a rectangular hyperbola as graph of a function]]\n[[File:Hyperbeln-gs-3.svg|thumb|Three rectangular hyperbolas <math>y=A/x</math> with the coordinate axes as asymptotes<br />\nred: A=1, magenta: A=4;

Because any hyperbola is an affine image of the hyperbola <math>y=1/x</math> (see section below) and an affine transformation preserves parallelism and midpoints of line segments, the property is true for all hyperbolas:<br />\nFor two points <math>P=(x_1,\\tfrac {1 }{x_1}), \\ Q=(x_2,\\tfrac {1 }{x_2})</math> of the hyperbola <math>y=1/x</math>  \n* the midpoint of the chord is <math>M=(\\tfrac{x_1+x_2}{2},\\cdots)=\\cdots =\\tfrac{x_1+x_2}{2}\\; (1,\\tfrac{1}{x_1x_2}) \\ ;</math>\n* the slope of the chord is <math>\\frac{\\tfrac {1 }{x_2}-\\tfrac {1 }{x_1}}{x_2-x_1}=\\cdots =-\\tfrac{1}{x_1x_2} \\ .</math>\nFor parallel chords the slope is constant and the midpoints of the parallel chords lie on the line <math>y=\\tfrac{1}{x_1x_2} \\; x \\ .</math>\n\nConsequence: for any pair of points <math>P,Q</math> of a chord there exists a ''skew reflection'' with an axis (set of fixed points) passing through the center of the hyperbola, which exchanges the points <math>P,Q</math> and leaves the hyperbola (as a whole) fixed. A skew reflection is a generalization of an ordinary reflection across a line <math>m</math>, where all point-image pairs are on a line perpendicular to <math>m</math>.\n\nBecause a skew reflection leaves the hyperbola fixed, the pair of asymptotes is fixed, too.

The process of \"reciprocation in a circle ''C''\" consists of replacing every line and point in a geometrical figure with their corresponding [[pole and polar]], respectively. The ''pole'' of a line is the [[inversive geometry#Circle inversion|inversion]] of its closest point to the circle ''C'', whereas the polar of a point is the converse, namely, a line whose closest point to ''C'' is the inversion of the point.\n\nThe eccentricity of the conic section obtained by reciprocation is the ratio of the distances between the two circles' centers to the radius ''r'' of reciprocation circle ''C''. If '''B''' and '''C''' represent the points at the centers of the corresponding circles, then\n\n:<math>\ne = \\frac{\\overline{BC}}{r}.\n</math>\n\nSince the eccentricity of a hyperbola is always greater than one, the center '''B''' must lie outside of the reciprocating circle ''C''.\n\nThis definition implies that the hyperbola is both the [[locus (mathematics)|locus]] of the poles of the tangent lines to the circle ''B'', as well as the [[envelope (mathematics)|envelope]] of the polar lines of the points on ''B''. Conversely, the circle ''B'' is the envelope of polars of points on the hyperbola, and the locus of poles of tangent lines to the hyperbola. Two tangent lines to ''B'' have no (finite) poles because they pass through the center '''C''' of the reciprocation circle ''C''; the polars of the corresponding tangent points on ''B'' are the asymptotes of the hyperbola. The two branches of the hyperbola correspond to the two parts of the circle ''B'' that are separated by these tangent points.\n\n===Quadratic equation===\nA hyperbola can also be defined as a second-degree equation in the Cartesian coordinates (''x'', ''y'') in the [[plane (geometry)|plane]],\n\n:<math>\nA_{xx} x^2 + 2 A_{xy} xy + A_{yy} y^2 + 2 B_x x + 2 B_y y + C = 0,\n</math>\n\nprovided that the constants ''A''<sub>''xx''</sub>, ''A''<sub>''xy''</sub>, ''A''<sub>''yy''</sub>, ''B''<sub>''x''</sub>, ''B''<sub>''y''</sub>, and ''C'' satisfy the determinant condition\n\n:<math>\nD := \\begin{vmatrix} A_{xx} & A_{xy}\\\\A_{xy} & A_{yy} \\end{vmatrix} < 0.\\,\n</math>\n\nThis determinant is conventionally called the [[discriminant#Discriminant of a conic section|discriminant]] of the conic section.<ref>{{citation\n|title=Math refresher for scientists and engineers\n|first1=John R.\n|last1=Fanchi\n|publisher=John Wiley and Sons\n|year=2006\n|isbn=0-471-75715-2\n|pages=44\u201345\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=75mAJPcAWT8C}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=75mAJPcAWT8C&pg=PA45 Section 3.2, page 45]\n</ref>\n\nA special case of a hyperbola\u2014the ''[[degenerate conic|degenerate hyperbola]]'' consisting of two intersecting lines\u2014occurs when another determinant is zero:\n\n:<math>\n\\Delta := \\begin{vmatrix} A_{xx} & A_{xy} & B_x \\\\A_{xy} & A_{yy} & B_y \\\\ B_x & B_y & C \\end{vmatrix} = 0.\n</math>\n\nThis determinant \u0394 is sometimes called the discriminant of the conic section.<ref>Korn, Granino A. and Korn, Theresa M.

The special case of a parabola does not appear in this example.<br />\n(If center O were ''on'' the sphere, all images of the circles would be circles or lines; see [[stereographic projection]]).]]\nBesides providing a uniform description of circles, ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas, conic sections can also be understood as a natural model of the geometry of perspective in the case where the scene being viewed consists of circles, or more generally an ellipse. The viewer is typically a camera or the human eye and the image of the scene a [[central projection]] onto an image plane, i.e., all projection rays pass a fixed point O, the center. The '''lens plane''' is a plane parallel to the image plane at the lens O.\n\nThe image of a circle c is \n:a) a '''circle''', if circle c is in a special position, for example parallel to the image plane and others (see stereographic projection),\n:b) an '''ellipse''', if c has ''no'' point with the lens plane in common,\n:c) a '''parabola''', if c has ''one'' point with the lens plane in common and\n:d) a '''hyperbola''', if c has ''two'' points with the lens plane in common.\n\n(Special positions where the circle plane contains point O are omitted.)\n\nThese results can be understood if one recognizes that the projection process can be seen in two steps: 1) circle c and point O generate a cone which is 2) cut by the image plane, in order to generate the image.\n\nOne sees a hyperbola whenever catching sight of a portion of a circle cut by one's lens plane. The inability to see very much of the arms of the visible branch, combined with the complete absence of the second branch, makes it virtually impossible for the human visual system to recognize the connection with hyperbolas.\n\n==Derived curves==\n{{Sinusoidal_spirals.svg}}\nSeveral other curves can be derived from the hyperbola by [[inversive geometry#Circle inversion|inversion]], the so-called [[inverse curve]]s of the hyperbola. If the center of inversion is chosen as the hyperbola's own center, the inverse curve is the [[lemniscate of Bernoulli]]; the lemniscate is also the envelope of circles centered on a rectangular hyperbola and passing through the origin. If the center of inversion is chosen at a focus or a vertex of the hyperbola, the resulting inverse curves are a [[lima\u00e7on]] or a [[strophoid]], respectively.\n\n== Elliptic coordinates ==\nA family of confocal hyperbolas is the basis of the system of [[elliptic coordinates]] in two dimensions. These hyperbolas are described by the equation\n\n:<math>\n\\left(\\frac x {c \\cos\\theta}\\right)^2 - \\left(\\frac y {c \\sin\\theta}\\right)^2 = 1\n</math>\n\nwhere the foci are located at a distance ''c'' from the origin on the ''x''-axis, and where \u03b8 is the angle of the asymptotes with the ''x''-axis. Every hyperbola in this family is orthogonal to every ellipse that shares the same foci. This orthogonality may be shown by a [[conformal map]] of the Cartesian coordinate system ''w'' = ''z'' + 1/''z'', where ''z''= ''x'' + ''iy'' are the original Cartesian coordinates, and ''w''=''u'' + ''iv'' are those after the transformation.\n\nOther orthogonal two-dimensional coordinate systems involving hyperbolas may be obtained by other conformal mappings. For example, the mapping ''w'' = ''z''<sup>2</sup> transforms the Cartesian coordinate system into two families of orthogonal hyperbolas.\n\n==Other properties of hyperbolas==\n*The following are [[concurrent lines|concurrent]]: (1) a circle passing through the hyperbola's foci and centered at the hyperbola's center; (2) either of the lines that are tangent to the hyperbola at the vertices; and (3) either of the asymptotes of the hyperbola.<ref name=web4>{{cite web|url=http://mathafou.free.fr/themes_en/hyperb.html|title=Hyperbola|website=Mathafou.free.fr|accessdate=26 August 2018}}</ref><ref name=web1>[http://www.ul.ie/~rynnet/swconics/HP%27s.htm]</ref>\n*The following are also concurrent: (1) the circle that is centered at the hyperbola's center and that passes through the hyperbola's vertices; (2) either directrix; and (3) either of the asymptotes.<ref name=web1/>\n\n==Hyperbolic functions==\n[[Image:Hyperbolic functions-2.svg|thumb|296px|right|A ray through the [[unit hyperbola]] <math>x^2\\ -\\ y^2\\ =\\ 1</math> in the point <math> (\\cosh\\,a,\\,\\sinh\\,a)</math>, where <math>a</math> is twice the area between the ray, the hyperbola, and the <math>x</math>-axis. For points on the hyperbola below the <math>x</math>-axis, the area is considered negative.]]\n\nJust as the [[trigonometric function]]s are defined in terms of the unit circle, so also the [[hyperbolic function]]s are defined in terms of the [[unit hyperbola]], as shown in this diagram.\n\n==Applications==\n[[File:Akademia Ekonomiczna w Krakowie Pawilon C.JPG|thumb|right|Hyperbolas as declination lines on a sundial]]\n\n===Sundials===\nHyperbolas may be seen in many [[sundial]]s. On any given day, the sun revolves in a circle on the [[celestial sphere]], and its rays striking the point on a sundial traces out a cone of light. The intersection of this cone with the horizontal plane of the ground forms a conic section. At most populated latitudes and at most times of the year, this conic section is a hyperbola. In practical terms, the shadow of the tip of a pole traces out a hyperbola on the ground over the course of a day (this path is called the ''declination line''). The shape of this hyperbola varies with the geographical latitude and with the time of the year, since those factors affect the cone of the sun's rays relative to the horizon. The collection of such hyperbolas for a whole year at a given location was called a ''pelekinon'' by the Greeks, since it resembles a double-bladed axe.\n\n===Multilateration===\nA hyperbola is the basis for solving [[multilateration]] problems, the task of locating a point from the differences in its distances to given points \u2014 or, equivalently, the difference in arrival times of synchronized signals between the point and the given points. Such problems are important in navigation, particularly on water; a ship can locate its position from the difference in arrival times of signals from a [[LORAN]] or [[GPS]] transmitters. Conversely, a homing beacon or any transmitter can be located by comparing the arrival times of its signals at two separate receiving stations; such techniques may be used to track objects and people. In particular, the set of possible positions of a point that has a distance difference of 2''a'' from two given points is a hyperbola of vertex separation 2''a'' whose foci are the two given points.\n\n===Path followed by a particle===\nThe path followed by any particle in the classical [[Kepler problem]] is a [[conic section]]. In particular, if the total energy ''E'' of the particle is greater than zero (i.e., if the particle is unbound), the path of such a particle is a hyperbola. This property is useful in studying atomic and sub-atomic forces by scattering high-energy particles; for example, the [[Geiger\u2013Marsden experiment|Rutherford experiment]] demonstrated the existence of an [[atomic nucleus]] by examining the scattering of [[alpha particle]]s from [[gold]] atoms. If the short-range nuclear interactions are ignored, the atomic nucleus and the alpha particle interact only by a repulsive [[Coulomb's law|Coulomb force]], which satisfies the [[inverse square law]] requirement for a Kepler problem.\n\n===Korteweg\u2013de Vries equation===\nThe hyperbolic trig function <math>\\operatorname{sech}\\, x</math> appears as one solution to the [[Korteweg\u2013de Vries equation]] which describes the motion of a soliton wave in a canal.\n\n===Angle trisection===\n[[File:Hyperbola angle trisection.svg|thumb|Trisecting an angle (AOB) using a hyperbola of eccentricity 2 (yellow curve)]]\n\nAs shown first by [[Apollonius of Perga]], a hyperbola can be used to [[angle trisection|trisect any angle]], a well studied problem of geometry. Given an angle, first draw a circle centered at its vertex '''O''', which intersects the sides of the angle at points '''A''' and '''B'''. Next draw the line segment with endpoints  '''A''' and '''B''' and its perpendicular bisector <math>\\ell</math>. Construct a hyperbola of [[eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity]] ''e''=2 with <math>\\ell</math> as [[Directrix (conic section)|directrix]] and '''B''' as a focus. Let '''P''' be the intersection (upper) of the hyperbola with the circle. Angle '''POB''' trisects angle '''AOB'''.\n\nTo prove this, reflect the line segment '''OP''' about the line <math>\\ell</math> obtaining the point '''P'''' as the image of '''P'''.

Like his father, [[Babur]], he lost his kingdom early but regained it with the aid of the [[Safavid dynasty]] of Persia, with additional territory. At the time of his death in 1556, the Mughal Empire spanned almost one million square kilometres.\n\nIn December 1530, Humayun succeeded his father to the throne of [[Delhi]] as ruler of the Mughal territories in the Indian subcontinent. At the age of 22, Humayun was an inexperienced ruler when he came to power. His half-brother [[Kamran Mirza]] inherited [[Kabul]] and [[Lahore]], the northernmost parts of their father's empire. Mirza was to become a bitter rival of Humayun.\n\nHumayun lost Mughal territories to [[Sher Shah Suri]], but regained them 15 years later with Safavid aid. Humayun's return from Persia was accompanied by a large retinue of Persian noblemen and signalled an important change in Mughal court culture. The [[Moghulistan|Central Asian origins]] of the dynasty were largely overshadowed by the influences of [[Persian art]], [[Persian architecture|architecture]], [[Persian language|language]] and [[Persian literature|literature]]. There are many stone carvings and thousands of [[Persian language In India|Persian]] manuscripts in India dating from the time of Humayun.\n\nSubsequently, Humayun further expanded the Empire in a very short time, leaving a substantial legacy for his son, [[Akbar]].\n\n==Background==\nThe decision of [[Babur]] to divide the territories of his empire between two of his sons was unusual in India, although it had been a common Central Asian practice since the time of [[Genghis Khan]]. Unlike most [[monarchies]], which practised [[primogeniture]], the Timurids followed the example of Genghis and did not leave an entire kingdom to the eldest son. Although under that system only a  could claim sovereignty and khanal authority, any male Chinggisid within a given sub-branch had an equal right to the throne (though the Timurids were not Chinggisid in their paternal ancestry).<ref name = \"Multiple\"/> While Genghis Khan's Empire had been peacefully divided between his sons upon his death, almost every Chinggisid succession since had resulted in fratricide.<ref>{{cite book |last=Soucek |first=Svat |date=2000 |title=A History of Inner Asia |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-65704-4}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=November 2012}}\n\nTimur himself had divided his territories among [[Pir Muhammad bin Jahangir Mirza|Pir Muhammad]], [[Miran Shah]], [[Khalil Sultan]] and [[Shah Rukh (Timurid dynasty)|Shah Rukh]], which resulted in inter-family warfare.<ref name=\"Multiple\">Sharaf Al-Din: \"Zafar-nama\".</ref>{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}{{npsn|date=May 2017}} Upon Babur's death, Humayun's territories were the least secure. He had ruled only four years, and not all ''umarah'' (nobles) viewed Humayun as the rightful ruler. Indeed, earlier, when Babur had become ill, some of the nobles had tried to install his Brother-in-law, Mahdi Khwaja, as ruler. Although this attempt failed, it was a sign of problems to come.<ref>Nizamuddin Ahmad: \"Tabaqat-i-Akbari\".</ref>{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}{{npsn|date=May 2017}}\n\n==Early reign==\n[[File:1508-Babur celebrates the birth of Humayun in the Chahar Bagh of Kabul.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Babur]] celebrates the birth of Humayun in the [[Charbagh]] of [[Kabul]].]]\n\nWhen Humayun came to the throne of the [[Mughal Empire]], several of his brothers revolted against him. Another brother Khalil Mirza (1509\u201330) supported Humayun but was assassinated. The Emperor commenced construction of a tomb for his brother in 1538, but this was not yet finished when Humayun was forced to flee to Persia. Sher Shah destroyed the structure and no further work was done on it after Humayun's restoration.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nHumayun had two major rivals for his lands: [[Sultan Bahadur]] of Gujarat to the southwest and [[Sher Shah Suri]] (Sher Khan) settled along the [[river Ganges]] in [[Bihar]] to the east. Humayun's first campaign was to confront Sher Shah Suri. Halfway through this offensive Humayun had to abandon it and concentrate on Gujarat, where a threat from Ahmed Shah had to be met. Humayun was victorious annexing [[Gujarat]], [[Malwa]], [[Champaner]] and the great fort of [[Mandu, Madhya Pradesh|Mandu]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nDuring the first five years of Humayun's reign, Bahadur and Sher Khan extended their rule, although Sultan Bahadur faced pressure in the east from sporadic conflicts with the [[Portugal|Portuguese]]. While the Mughals had obtained firearms via the [[Ottoman Empire]], Bahadur's Gujarat had acquired them through a series of contracts drawn up with the Portuguese, allowing the Portuguese to establish a strategic foothold in north western India.<ref name = \"Multiple2\"/>\n\nIn 1535 Humayun was made aware that the Sultan of Gujarat was planning an assault on the Mughal territories with Portuguese aid. Humayun gathered an army and marched on Bahadur. Within a month he had captured the forts of [[Mandu, Madhya Pradesh|Mandu]] and [[Champaner]]. However, instead of pressing his attack, Humayun ceased the campaign  and consolidated his newly conquered territory. Sultan Bahadur, meanwhile escaped and took up refuge with the Portuguese.<ref name=\"Banerji1938\">{{harvnb|Banerji|1938}}</ref>\n\n==Sher Shah Suri==\n[[File:Flight of Sultan Bahadur During Humayun's Campaign in Gujarat 1535.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Mughal Emperor]] Humayun, fights [[Bahadur Shah of Gujarat]], in the year 1535.]]\n\nShortly after Humayun had marched on Gujarat, [[Sher Shah Suri]] saw an opportunity to wrest control of Agra from the Mughals. He began to gather his army together hoping for a rapid and decisive siege of the Mughal capital. Upon hearing this alarming news, Humayun quickly marched his troops back to Agra allowing Bahadur to easily regain control of the territories Humayun had recently taken. In February 1537, however, Bahadur was killed when a botched plan to kidnap the Portuguese viceroy ended in a fire-fight that the Sultan lost.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nWhilst Humayun succeeded in protecting Agra from Sher Shah, the second city of the Empire, [[Gaur, West Bengal|Gaur]] the capital of the ''vilayat'' of Bengal, was sacked. Humayun's troops had been delayed while trying to take [[Chunar]], a fort occupied by Sher Shah's son, in order to protect his troops from an attack from the rear. The stores of grain at Gauri, the largest in the empire, were emptied, and Humayun arrived to see corpses littering the roads.<ref name = \"Multiple3\"/> The vast wealth of Bengal was depleted and brought East, giving Sher Shah a substantial war chest.<ref name = \"Multiple2\"/>\n\nSher Shah withdrew to the east, but Humayun did not follow: instead he \"shut himself up for a considerable time in his Harem, and indulged himself in every kind of luxury.\"<ref name=\"Multiple3\">Jauhar: \"Tadhkirat al-Waqiat\".</ref>{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}{{npsn|date=May 2017}} Hindal, Humayun's 19-year-old brother, had agreed to aid him in this battle and protect the rear from attack, but he abandoned his position and withdrew to Agra, where he decreed himself acting emperor. When Humayun sent the grand ''Mufti'', Sheikh Buhlul, to reason with him; the Sheikh was killed.

However, his return home had treacherous motives as he intended to stake a claim for Humayun's apparently collapsing empire.

This was to become an entrenched battle in which both sides spent a lot of time digging themselves into positions. The major part of the Mughal army, the artillery, was now immobile, and Humayun decided to engage in some diplomacy using Muhammad Aziz as ambassador. Humayun agreed to allow Sher Shah to rule over Bengal and Bihar, but only as provinces granted to him by his Emperor, Humayun, falling short of outright sovereignty. The two rulers also struck a bargain in order to save face: Humayun's troops would charge those of Sher Shah whose forces then retreat in feigned fear. Thus honour would, supposedly, be satisfied.<ref>Badauni: \"Muntakhab al-Tawarikh\".</ref>{{npsn|date=May 2017}}\n\nOnce the Army of Humayun had made its charge and Sher Shah's troops made their agreed-upon retreat, the Mughal troops relaxed their defensive preparations and returned to their entrenchments without posting a proper guard. Observing the Mughals' vulnerability, Sher Shah reneged on his earlier agreement. That very night, his army approached the Mughal camp and finding the Mughal troops unprepared with a majority asleep, they advanced and killed most of them.

Humayun was soundly defeated. He retreated to Agra, pursued by Sher Shah, and thence through [[Delhi]] to Lahore.

When he reached [[Sirhind]], Humayun sent an ambassador carrying the message \"I have left you the whole of Hindustan (''i.e.'' the lands to the East of Punjab, comprising most of the Ganges Valley). Leave Lahore alone, and let Sirhind be a boundary between you and me.\" Sher Shah, however, replied \"I have left you Kabul. You should go there.\" [[Kabul]] was the capital of the empire of Humayun's brother Kamran, who was far from willing to hand over any of his territories to his brother. Instead, Kamran approached Sher Shah and proposed that he actually revolt against his brother and side with Sher Shah in return for most of the [[Punjab region|Punjab]]. Sher Shah dismissed his help, believing it not to be required, though word soon spread to Lahore about the treacherous proposal, and Humayun was urged to make an example of Kamran and kill him. Humayun refused, citing the last words of his father, [[Babur]], \"Do nothing against your brothers, even though they may deserve it.\"<ref name=\"Multiple8\">[[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak|Abul-Fazel]]: \"Akbar-nama\".</ref>{{npsn|date=May 2017}}\n\n===Withdrawing further===\n[[File:Humayun's Genealogical Order up to Timure.jpg|thumb|Humayun's Genealogical Order up to Timur]]\nHumayun decided it would be wise to withdraw still further. He and his army rode out through and across the [[Thar Desert]], when the [[Hindu]] ruler [[Rao Maldeo Rathore]] allied with Sher Shah Suri against the Mughal Empire. In many accounts Humayun mentions how he and his pregnant wife had to trace their steps through the desert at the hottest time of year. Their rations were low, and they had little to eat; even drinking water was a major problem in the desert. When [[Hamida Banu Begum|Hamida Bano]]'s horse died, no one would lend the Queen (who was now eight months pregnant) a horse, so Humayun did so himself, resulting in him riding a camel for six kilometres (four miles), although Khaled Beg then offered him his mount. Humayun was later to describe this incident as the lowest point in his life.\nHumayun asked that his brothers join him as he fell back into [[Sindh]]. While the previously rebellious Hindal Mirza remained loyal and was ordered to join his brothers in Kandahar. Kamran Mirza and Askari Mirza instead decided to head to the relative peace of Kabul. This was to be a definitive schism in the family. Humayun headed for [[Sindh]] because he expected aid from the [[Emir]] of [[Sindh]], Hussein Umrani, whom he had appointed and who owed him his allegiance. Also, his wife Hamida hailed from Sindh; she was the daughter of a prestigious ''pir'' family (a ''pir'' is a [[Shia]] or [[Sufi]] religious mystic) of Persian heritage long settled in Sindh. En route to the Emir's court, Humayun had to break journey because his pregnant wife Hamida was unable to travel further. Humayun sought refuge with the [[Hindu]] ruler of the [[oasis]] town of [[Umerkot|Amarkot]] (now part of Sindh province).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Tareekh-i- Sher Shahi|last=Sarwani|first=Abbas Khan|publisher=Sang-i-Meel Publishers|year=2006|isbn=978-9693518047|location=Lahore, Pakistan|pages=}}</ref>\n\nRana Prasad Rao of [[Umerkot|Amarkot]] duly welcomed Humayun into his home and sheltered the refugees for several months. Here, in the household of a Hindu [[Rajput]] nobleman, Humayun's wife Hamida Bano, daughter of a Sindhi family, gave birth to the future Emperor [[Akbar]] on 15 October 1542. The date of birth is well established because Humayun consulted his astronomer to utilise the [[astrolabe]] and check the location of the planets. The infant was the long-awaited heir-apparent to the 34-year-old Humayun and the answer of many prayers. Shortly after the birth, Humayun and his party left Amarkot for Sindh, leaving Hamida and her child in the custody of their Hindu hosts. A couple of years later, at Humayun's behest, Hamida would leave her infant son in the safety of remote Amarkot and join her husband as he fled into Persia. The infant Akbar was to live for more than five years, all alone, in the care of a Hindu, [[Rajput]] foster-family. This was to have a profound, indelible influence on his views and personality, and a momentous effect on the subsequent history of India. In particular, Akbar developed a strong affinity for the Rajputs, going out of his way to forge alliances (including marriage alliances) with them, and they would form the bedrock of support for his dynasty for two centuries.\n\nFor a change, Humayun was not deceived in the character of the man on whom he has pinned his hopes. Emir Hussein Umrani, ruler of Sindh, welcomed Humayun's presence and was loyal to Humayun just as he had been loyal to Babur against the renegade [[Arghun]]s. While in Sindh, Humayun alongside Emir Hussein Umrani, gathered horses and weapons and formed new alliances that helped regain lost territories. Until finally Humayun had gathered hundreds of [[Sindhis|Sindhi]] and [[Baloch people|Baloch]] tribesmen alongside his Mughals and then marched towards Kandahar and later Kabul, thousands more gathered by his side as Humayun continually declared himself the rightful [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] heir of the first Mughal Emperor, Babur.\n\n==Retreat to Kabul==\n[[File:Humayun finally defeated his rebellious brother Kamran in Kabul in 1553.jpg|thumb|200px|Humayun and his [[Mughal Army]] defeats [[Kamran Mirza]] in 1553.]]\n\nAfter Humayun set out from his expedition in [[Sindh]], along with 300 camels (mostly wild) and 2000 loads of grain, he set off to join his brothers in Kandahar after crossing the [[Indus River]] on 11 July 1543 along with the ambition to regain the Mughal Empire and overthrow the [[Suri dynasty]]. Among the tribes that had sworn allegiance to Humayun were the Magsi, [[Rind (Baloch tribe)|Rind]] and many others.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nIn Kamran Mirza's territory, Hindal Mirza had been placed under [[house arrest]] in [[Kabul]] after refusing to have the ''[[Khutba]]'' recited in Kamran Mirza's name. His other brother Askari Mirza was now ordered to gather an army and march on Humayun. When Humayun received word of the approaching hostile army he decided against facing them, and instead sought refuge elsewhere. Akbar was left behind in camp close to Kandahar for, as it was December it would have been too cold and dangerous to include the 14-month-old toddler in the forthcoming march through the dangerous and snowy mountains of the [[Hindu Kush]].

Amongst other trials the Imperial party were forced to live on horse meat boiled in the soldiers' helmets. These indignities continued during the month it took them to reach [[Herat]], however after their arrival they were reintroduced to the finer things in life. Upon entering  the city his army was greeted with an armed escort, and they were treated to lavish food and clothing. They were given fine accommodations and the roads were cleared and cleaned before them. [[Tahmasp I|Shah Tahmasp]], unlike Humayun's own family, actually welcomed the Mughal, and treated him as a royal visitor. Here Humayun went sightseeing and was amazed at the Persian artwork and architecture he saw: much of this was the work of the Timurid Sultan [[Husayn Bayqarah]] and his ancestor, princess [[Gauhar Shad]], thus he was able to admire the work of his relatives and ancestors at first hand.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nHe was introduced to the work of the Persian miniaturists, and [[Kamaleddin Behzad]] had two of his pupils join Humayun in his court. Humayun was amazed at their work and asked if they would work for him if he were to regain the sovereignty of Hindustan: they agreed. With so much going on Humayun did not even meet the Shah until July, some six months after his arrival in Persia. After a lengthy journey from Herat the two met in [[Qazvin (city)|Qazvin]] where a large feast and parties were held for the event. The meeting of the two monarchs is depicted in a famous wall-painting in the [[Chehel Sotoun]] (Forty Columns) palace in [[Isfahan (city)|Esfahan]].\n\nThe Shah urged that Humayun convert from [[Sunni]] to [[Shia Islam]], and Humayun eventually accepted, in order to keep himself and several hundred followers alive. Although the Mughals initially disagreed to their conversion they knew that with this outward acceptance of Shi'ism, [[Tahmasp I|Shah Tahmasp]] was eventually prepared to offer Humayun more substantial support.<ref>{{harvnb|Richards|1993|p=11|ps=: \"At the Safavid court, Humayun, under extreme duress, accepted the Shia faith in order to keep himself and several hundred followers alive. After this initial test, Shah Tahmasp grew more friendly and eventually agreed to underwrite Humayun's attempt to regain power.\"}}</ref> When Humayun's brother, Kamran Mirza, offered to cede Kandahar to the Persians in exchange for Humayun, dead or alive, [[Tahmasp I|Shah Tahmasp]] refused. Instead the Shah staged a celebration for Humayun, with 300 tents, an imperial Persian carpet, 12 musical bands and \"meat of all kinds\". Here the Shah announced that all this, and 12,000 elite cavalry{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} were his to lead an attack on his brother Kamran. All that [[Tahmasp I|Shah Tahmasp]] asked for was that, if Humayun's forces were victorious, Kandahar would be his.\n\n==Kandahar and onwards==\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2017}}\n[[File:\u2018Abd al-Samad. Akbar Presents a Painting to His Father Humayun. Mughal, probably Kabul, c. 1550\u20131556. Golestan Palace Library, Tehran.jpg|thumb|upright|The infant [[Akbar]] presents a painting to his father Humayun.]]\n\nWith this Persian [[Safavid Dynasty|Safavid]] aid Humayun took [[Kandahar]] from Askari Mirza after a two-week siege. He noted how the nobles who had served Askari Mirza quickly flocked to serve him, \"in very truth the greater part of the inhabitants of the world are like a flock of sheep, wherever one goes the others immediately follow\". Kandahar was, as agreed, given to the Shah of Persia who sent his infant son, Murad, as the Viceroy. However, the baby soon died and Humayun thought himself strong enough to assume power.\n\nHumayun now prepared to take Kabul, ruled by his brother Kamran Mirza. In the end, there was no actual siege. Kamran Mirza was detested as a leader and as Humayun's Persian army approached the city hundreds of Kamran Mirza's troops changed sides, flocking to join Humayun and swelling his ranks. Kamran Mirza absconded and began building an army outside the city. In November 1545, Hamida and Humayun were reunited with their son [[Akbar]], and held a huge feast. They also held another, larger, feast in the child's honour when he was [[Circumcision|circumcised]].\n\n[[File:The Emperor Humayun Returning from a Journey Greets his Son.jpg|thumb|200px|Humayun is reunited with [[Akbar]].]]\n\nHowever, while Humayun had a larger army than his brother and had the upper hand, on two occasions his poor military judgement allowed Kamran Mirza to retake Kabul and Kandahar, forcing Humayun to mount further campaigns for their recapture. He may have been aided in this by his reputation for leniency towards the troops who had defended the cities against him, as opposed to Kamran Mirza, whose brief periods of possession were marked by atrocities against the inhabitants who, he supposed, had helped his brother.\n\nHis youngest brother, Hindal Mirza, formerly the most disloyal of his siblings, died fighting on his behalf. His brother Askari Mirza was shackled in chains at the behest of his nobles and aides. He was allowed go on [[Hajj]], and died en route in the desert outside [[Damascus]].\n\nHumayun's other brother, Kamran Mirza, had repeatedly sought to have Humayun killed. In 1552 Kamran Mirza attempted to make a pact with [[Islam Shah]], [[Sher Shah Suri|Sher Shah's]] successor, but was apprehended by a [[Gakhars|Gakhar]]. The Gakhars were one of the minority of tribal groups who had consistently remained loyal to their oath to the Mughals. Sultan Adam of the Gakhars handed Kamran Mirza over to Humayun. Humayun was inclined to forgive his brother. However he was warned that allowing Kamran Mirza's repeated acts of treachery to go unpunished could foment rebellion amongst his own supporters. So, instead of killing his brother, Humayun had Kamran Mirza blinded which would end any claim by the latter to the throne. Humayun sent Kamran Mirza on [[Hajj]], as he hoped to see his brother thereby absolved of his offences. However Kamran Mirza died close to [[Mecca]] in the [[Arabian Peninsula]] in 1557.\n\n==Restoration of the Mughal Empire==\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2017}}\n[[File:Humayun Receives the Head of Qaracha Khan.jpg|thumb|200px|The Mughal Emperor Humayun receiving the head of his opponent.]]\n[[File:Humayun sitting.jpg|thumb|200px|An image from an album commissioned by [[Shah Jahan]] shows Humayun sitting beneath a tree in his garden in India.]]\n\n[[Sher Shah Suri]] had died in 1545; his son and successor [[Islam Shah]] died in 1554. These two deaths left the dynasty reeling and disintegrating. Three rivals for the throne all marched on Delhi, while in many cities leaders tried to stake a claim for independence. This was a perfect opportunity for the Mughals to march back to India.\n\nThe Mughal Emperor Humayun gathered a vast army and attempted the challenging task of retaking the throne in Delhi. Humayun placed the army under the leadership of [[Bairam Khan]], a wise move given Humayun's own record of military ineptitude, and it turned out to be prescient as Bairam proved himself a great tactician. At the  [[Battle of Sirhind (1555)|Battle of Sirhind]] on 22 June 1555, the armies of [[Sikandar Shah Suri]] were decisively defeated and the [[Mughal Empire]] was re-established in [[India]].\n\n===Marriage relations with the Khanzadas===\nThe ''Gazetteer of Ulwur'' states:\n\n{{quote|Soon after Babur's death, his successor, Humayun, was in AD 1540 supplanted by the Pathan Sher Shah, who, in AD 1545, was followed by Islam Shah. During the reign of the latter a battle was fought and lost by the Emperor's troops at Firozpur Jhirka, in Mewat, on which, however, Islam Shah did not loose his hold. Adil Shah, the third of the Pathan interlopers, who succeeded in AD 1552, had to contend for the Empire with the returned Humayun.\n\nIn these struggles for the restoration of Babar's dynasty Khanzadas apparently do not figure at all. Humayun seems to have conciliated them by marrying the elder daughter of Jamal Khan, nephew of Babar's opponent, Hasan Khan, and by causing his great minister, Bairam Khan, to marry a younger daughter of the same Mewatti.<ref>{{cite book |last=Powlett |first=P.

The fort of [[Rohtas Fort|Rohtas]], which was built in 1541\u201343 by Sher Shah Suri to crush the [[Gakhars]] who were loyal to Humayun, was surrendered without a shot by a treacherous commander. The walls of the Rohtas Fort measure up to 12.5 meters in thickness and up to 18.28 meters in height. They extend for 4&nbsp;km and feature 68 semi-circular bastions. Its sandstone gates, both massive and ornate, are thought to have exerted a profound influence on [[Mughal architecture|Mughal]] military architecture.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nThe only major battle faced by Humayun's armies was against Sikander Suri in [[Sirhind]], where Bairam Khan employed a tactic whereby he engaged his enemy in open battle, but then retreated quickly in apparent fear. When the enemy followed after them they were surprised by entrenched defensive positions and were easily annihilated.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nAfter Sirhind, most towns and villages chose to welcome the invading army as it made its way to the capital. On 23 July 1555, Humayun once again sat on Babur's throne in Delhi.\n\n===Ruling Kashmir===\n[[File:Copper coin of Humayun, 944 A. H., Delhi.JPG|thumb|200px|Copper coin of Humayun]]\n\nWith all of Humayun's brothers now dead, there was no fear of another usurping his throne during his military campaigns. He was also now an established leader and could trust his generals. With this new-found strength Humayun embarked on a series of military campaigns aimed at extending his reign over areas in eastern and western India. His sojourn in exile seems to have reduced his reliance on astrology, and his military leadership came to imitate the more effective methods that he had observed in Persia.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n== Character ==\nEdward S.

''Kurf\u00fcrsten'', {{lang-cz|Kurfi\u0159t}}, {{lang-la|Princeps Elector}}) of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], or '''Electors''' for short, were the members of the [[electoral college]] that elected the [[Holy Roman Emperor]].\n\nFrom the 13th century onwards, the Prince-Electors had the privilege of [[Imperial election|electing]] the [[King of the Romans]], who would be crowned by the Pope as Holy Roman Emperor. [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] was the last to be a crowned Emperor (elected 1519, crowned 1530); his successors were elected Emperors directly by the electoral college, each being titled \"Elected Emperor of the Romans\" ({{lang-de|erw\u00e4hlter R\u00f6mischer Kaiser}}; {{lang-la|electus Romanorum imperator}}). In practice, every emperor from 1440 onwards (except for [[Charles VII, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VII]] and [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis I]]) came from the Austrian [[House of Habsburg]], and the Electors merely ratified the Habsburg [[Order of succession|succession]].\n\nThe dignity of Elector carried great prestige and was considered to be second only to that of King or Emperor.<ref>[http://www.heraldica.org/topics/royalty/nations.htm Precedence among Nations]</ref> The Electors had exclusive privileges that were not shared with the other princes of the Empire, and they continued to hold their original titles alongside that of Elector. The [[heir apparent]] to a secular prince-elector was known  as an '''electoral prince''' ({{lang-de|Kurprinz}}).\n\n== Etymology of ''Kurf\u00fcrst'' ==\n\nThe German element ''Kur-'' is based on the [[Middle High German]] irregular verb ''kiesen''<ref>[[Deutsches W\u00f6rterbuch]]: [http://www.woerterbuchnetz.de/DWB?lemma=kurfuerst Kurf\u00fcrst], [http://www.woerterbuchnetz.de/DWB?lemma=kuer K\u00fcr] and [http://www.woerterbuchnetz.de/DWB?lemma=kiesen kiesen]</ref> and is related etymologically to the English word ''choose'' (cf. [[Old English language|Old English]] ''ceosan'' {{IPA-ang|t\u0283eo\u032fzan|}}, participle ''coren'' 'having been chosen' and [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''kiusan''). In English, the \"s\"/\"r\" mix in the Germanic verb conjugation has been regularized to \"s\" throughout, while German retains the ''r'' in ''Kur-''. There is also a modern German verb ''k\u00fcren'' which means 'to choose' in a ceremonial sense. ''[[F\u00fcrst]]'' is German for 'prince', but while the German language distinguishes between the head of a principality (''der F\u00fcrst'') and the son of a monarch (''der Prinz''), English uses ''prince'' for both concepts. ''F\u00fcrst'' itself is related to English ''first'' and is thus the 'foremost' person in his realm. Note that 'prince' derives from Latin ''princeps'', which carried the same meaning.\n\n== Rights and privileges ==\nElectors were ''reichsst\u00e4nde'' ([[Imperial State|Imperial Estates]]), enjoying precedence over the other princes. They were, until the 18th century, exclusively entitled to be addressed with the title ''Durchlaucht'' (Serene Highness). In 1742, the electors became entitled to the superlative ''Durchl\u00e4uchtigste'' (Most Serene Highness), while other princes were promoted to ''Durchlaucht''.\n\nAs Imperial Estates, the electors enjoyed all the privileges of the other princes enjoying that status, including the right to enter into alliances, autonomy in relation to dynastic affairs and precedence over other subjects. The Golden Bull had granted them the [[Privilegium de non appellando]], which prevented their subjects from lodging an appeal to a higher Imperial court. However, while this privilege, and some others, were automatically granted to Electors, they were not exclusive to them and many of the larger Imperial Estates were also to be individually granted some or all those rights and privileges.<ref>Even a small [[Free Imperial City]] such as [[Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd]] had been granted the ''Privilegium de non appellando'' in 1475. Cf. [[:s:de:Kaiser Friedrich III.: Privilegium de non appellando f\u00fcr Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd, 1475|Kaiser Friedrich III.: Privilegium de non appellando f\u00fcr Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd, 1475]]</ref>\n\n== Imperial Diet ==\nThe electors, like the other princes ruling States of the Empire, were members of the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]], which was divided into three ''collegia'': the Council of Electors, the Council of Princes, and the Council of Cities. In addition to being members of the Council of Electors, several lay electors were therefore members of the Council of Princes as well by virtue of other territories they possessed. In many cases, the lay electors ruled numerous States of the Empire, and therefore held several votes in the Council of Princes. In 1792, the King of Bohemia held three votes, the Elector of Bavaria six votes, the Elector of Brandenburg eight votes, and the Elector of Hanover six votes. Thus, of the hundred votes in the [[List of Imperial Diet participants (1792)|Council of Princes in 1792]], twenty-three belonged to electors. The lay electors therefore exercised considerable influence, being members of the small Council of Electors and holding a significant number of votes in the Council of Princes. The assent of both bodies was required for important decisions affecting the structure of the Empire, such as the creation of new electorates or States of the Empire.\n\nIn addition to voting by colleges or councils, the Imperial Diet also voted on religious lines, as provided for by the [[Peace of Westphalia]]. The Archbishop of Mainz presided over the [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]] body, or ''corpus catholicorum'', while the Elector of Saxony presided over the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] body, or ''[[corpus evangelicorum]]''. The division into religious bodies was on the basis of the official religion of the state, and not of its rulers. Thus, even when the Electors of Saxony were Catholics during the eighteenth century, they continued to preside over the ''corpus evangelicorum'', since the state of Saxony was officially Protestant.\n\n== Elections ==\n{{Main|Imperial election}}\n[[File:Wapen 1545 Kaiserwappen des Heiligen R\u00f6mischen Reichs Polychromie.jpg|thumb|300px|Coats of arms of prince electors surround the Holy Roman Emperor's; from flags book of [[Jacob K\u00f6bel]] (1545). Left to right: Cologne, Bohemia, Brandenburg, Saxony, the Palatinate, Trier, Mainz]]\nThe individual chosen by the electors assumed the title \"King of the Romans\", though he actually reigned in Germany. The King of the Romans became Holy Roman Emperor only when crowned by the Pope. On many occasions, a Pope refused to crown a king with whom he was engaged in a dispute, but a lack of a papal coronation deprived a king of only the title Emperor and not of the power to govern{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} (cf [[Declaration of Rhense]]). The Habsburg dynasty stopped the practice of papal coronations. After [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], all individuals chosen by the electors were merely \"Emperors elect\".{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\nThe electors were originally summoned by the Archbishop of Mainz within one month of an Emperor's death, and met within three months of being summoned. During the ''interregnum'', imperial power was exercised by two [[imperial vicar]]s. Each vicar, in the words of the Golden Bull, was \"the administrator of the empire itself, with the power of passing judgments, of presenting to ecclesiastical benefices, of collecting returns and revenues and investing with fiefs, of receiving oaths of fealty for and in the name of the holy empire\". The Elector of Saxony was vicar in areas operating under Saxon law ([[Saxony]], [[Westphalia]], [[Electorate of Hanover|Hanover]], and northern Germany), while the Elector Palatine was vicar in the remainder of the Empire ([[Franconia]], [[Swabia]], the [[Rhine]], and southern Germany). The Elector of Bavaria replaced the Elector Palatine in 1623, but when the latter was granted a new electorate in 1648, there was a dispute between the two as to which was vicar. In 1659, both purported to act as vicar, but the other vicar recognised the Elector of Bavaria. Later, the two electors made a pact to act as joint vicars, but the Imperial Diet rejected the agreement. In 1711, while the Elector of Bavaria was under the [[ban of the Empire]], the Elector Palatine again acted as vicar, but his cousin was restored to his position upon his restoration three years later.  Finally, in 1745, the two agreed to alternate as vicars, with Bavaria starting first. This arrangement was upheld by the Imperial Diet in 1752. In 1777 the question became moot when the Elector Palatine inherited Bavaria.  On many occasions, however, there was no interregnum, as a new king had been elected during the lifetime of the previous Emperor.\n\n[[Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt]] regularly served as the site of the election from the fifteenth century on, but elections were also held at [[Cologne]] (1531), [[Regensburg]] (1575 and 1636), and [[Augsburg]] (1653 and 1690). An elector could appear in person or could appoint another elector as his proxy. More often, an electoral suite or embassy was sent to cast the vote; the credentials of such representatives were verified by the Archbishop of Mainz, who presided over the ceremony. The deliberations were held at the city hall, but voting occurred in the cathedral. In Frankfurt, a special electoral chapel, or ''Wahlkapelle'', was used for elections. Under the Golden Bull, a majority of electors sufficed to elect a king, and each elector could cast only one vote. Electors were free to vote for whomsoever they pleased (including themselves), but dynastic considerations played a great part in the choice. Electors drafted a ''[[Wahlkapitulation]]'', or electoral capitulation, which was presented to the king-elect. The capitulation may be described as a contract between the princes and the king, the latter conceding rights and powers to the electors and other princes. Once an individual swore to abide by the electoral capitulation, he assumed the office of King of the Romans.\n\nIn the 10th and 11th centuries, princes often acted merely to confirm hereditary succession in the Saxon [[Ottonian dynasty]] and Franconian [[Salian dynasty]]. But with the actual formation of the prince-elector class, elections became more open, starting with the election of [[Lothair II, Holy Roman Emperor|Lothair II]] in 1125. The [[Hohenstaufen|Staufen]] dynasty managed to get its sons formally elected in their fathers' lifetimes almost as a formality. After these lines ended in extinction, the electors began to elect kings from different families so that the throne would not once again settle within a single dynasty. For some two centuries, the monarchy was elective both in theory and in practice; the arrangement, however, did not last, since the powerful [[House of Habsburg]] managed to secure succession within their dynasty during the fifteenth century. All kings elected from 1438 onwards were from among the Habsburg Archdukes of Austria (and later Kings of Hungary and Bohemia) until 1740, when the archduchy was inherited by a woman, [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]], sparking the [[War of the Austrian Succession]]. A representative of the House of Wittelsbach was elected for a short period of time, but in 1745, Maria Theresa's husband, [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis I]] of the Habsburg-Lorraine dynasty, became King. All of his successors were also from the same family. Hence, for the greater part of the Empire's history, the role of the electors was largely ceremonial.\n\n== High offices ==\n<!--This section linked from [[Clemens August of Bavaria]]-->\n\n[[Image:COA family de Kurpfalz.svg|thumb|150px|right|The Arms of [[Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria|Maximilian, Duke of Bavaria]], Arch-Steward and Prince-Elector.]]\n[[Image:Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom (1816-1837).svg|thumb|150px|right|The Arms of [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]], King of Great Britain and Ireland and Elector (later King) of Hanover.]]\nEach elector held a \"High Office of the Empire\" (''Reichserz\u00e4mter'') and was a member of the (ceremonial) [[Imperial Household]]. The three spiritual electors were all Arch-Chancellors ({{lang-de|Erzkanzler}}, {{lang-la|Archicancellarius}}): the [[Archbishop of Mainz]] was Arch-Chancellor of Germany, the [[Archbishop of Cologne]] was Arch-Chancellor of Italy, and the [[Archbishop of Trier]] was Arch-Chancellor of Burgundy.

When the Count Palatine was granted a new electorate, he assumed the position of Arch-Treasurer of the Empire. When the Duke of Bavaria was banned in 1706, the Elector Palatine returned to the office of Arch-Steward, and in 1710 the Elector of Hanover was promoted to the post of Arch-Treasurer. Matters were complicated by the Duke of Bavaria's restoration in 1714; the Elector of Bavaria resumed the office of Arch-Steward, while the Elector Palatine returned to the post of Arch-Treasurer, and the Elector of Hanover was given the new office of Archbannerbearer. The Electors of Hanover, however, continued to be styled Arch-Treasurers, though the Elector Palatine was the one who actually exercised the office until 1777, when he inherited Bavaria and the Arch-Stewardship. After 1777, no further changes were made to the Imperial Household; new offices were planned for the Electors admitted in 1803, but the Empire was abolished before they could be created. The Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg, however, started to adopt the trappings of the Arch-Bannerbearer.\n\nMany High Officers were entitled to use [[Augmentation of Honour|augmentations]] on their [[heraldry|coats of arms]]; these augmentations, which were special marks of honour, appeared in the centre of the electors' shields (as shown in the image above) atop the other charges (in [[Heraldry|heraldic]] terms, the augmentations appeared in the form of [[inescutcheon]]s). The Arch-Steward used ''[[gules]] an [[Globus cruciger|orb]] [[Or (heraldry)|Or]]'' (a gold orb on a red field). The Arch-Marshal utilised the more complicated ''[[Fess|per fess]] [[Sable (heraldry)|sable]] and [[argent]], two swords in [[saltire]] gules'' (two red swords arranged in the form of a [[saltire]], on a black and white field). The Arch-Chamberlain's augmentation was ''[[azure (heraldry)|azure]] a sceptre [[Pale (heraldry)|palewise]] Or'' (a gold sceptre on a blue field), while the Arch-Treasurer's was ''gules the [[Imperial Crown of the Holy Roman Empire|crown of Charlemagne]] Or'' (a gold crown on a red field). As noted above, the Elector Palatine and the Elector of Hanover styled themselves Arch-Treasurer from 1714 until 1777; during this time, both electors used the corresponding augmentations. The three Arch-Chancellors and the Arch-Cupbearer did not use any augmentations.\n\nThe electors discharged the ceremonial duties associated with their offices only during coronations, where they bore the crown and regalia of the Empire. Otherwise, they were represented by holders of corresponding \"[[Hereditary Offices of the Household]]\". The Arch-Butler was represented by the Butler ([[Cupbearer]]) (the [[Count of Althann]]), the Arch-Seneschal by the [[Steward (office)|Steward]] (the [[House of Waldburg|Count of Waldburg]]), the Arch-Chamberlain by the [[Chamberlain (office)|Chamberlain]] (the [[Count of Hohenzollern]]), the Arch-Marshal by the [[Marshal]] (the [[Count of Pappenheim]]), and the Arch-Treasurer by the [[Treasurer]] (the [[Count of Sinzendorf]]). The Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg assigned the count of Zeppelin-[[Aschhausen]] as hereditary Bannerbearer.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Philipp Veit 008.jpg|thumb|Coats of arms representing the seven original electors with the figure of [[Germania (personification)|Germania]]]]\n\nThe German practice of electing [[monarch]]s began when ancient [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]] formed ''ad hoc'' coalitions and elected the leaders thereof. Elections were irregularly held by the [[Franks]], whose [[successor state]]s include [[France]] and the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The [[List of French monarchs|French monarchy]] eventually became [[Heredity|hereditary]], but the Holy Roman Emperors remained elective, at least in theory, although the Habsburgs provided most of the later monarchs. While all free men originally exercised the right to vote in such elections, suffrage eventually came to be limited to the leading men of the realm. In the election of [[Lothar II, Holy Roman Emperor|Lothar II]] in 1125, a small number of eminent [[nobility|noble]]s chose the monarch and then submitted him to the remaining magnates for their approbation.\n\nSoon, the right to choose the monarch was settled on an exclusive group of princes, and the procedure of seeking the approval of the remaining nobles was abandoned. The college of electors was mentioned in 1152 and again in 1198. The composition of electors at that time is unclear, but appears to have included representatives of the church and the [[duke]]s of the [[Stem duchy|four nations of Germany]]: the [[Franks]] ([[Duchy of Franconia]]), [[Swabians]] ([[Duchy of Swabia]]), [[Saxons]] ([[Duchy of Saxony]]) and [[Bavarians]] ([[Duchy of Bavaria]]).\n\n=== 1257 to Thirty Years' War ===\n\nThe electoral college is known to have existed by 1152, but its composition is unknown. A letter written by [[Pope Urban IV]] in 1265 suggests that by \"[[time immemorial|immemorial custom]]\", seven princes had the right to elect the King and future Emperor. The pope wrote that the seven electors were those who had just voted in the election of 1257, which resulted in the election of two kings.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bryce |first1=James |title=The Holy Roman Empire |date=1866 |publisher=Macmillan |location=London |page=252 |edition=Revised}}</ref>\n\n* Three ecclesiastical Electors:\n** The [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Archbishop of Mainz]]\n** The [[Electorate of Trier|Archbishop of Trier]]\n** The [[Electorate of Cologne|Archbishop of Cologne]]\n* Four secular Electors:\n** The [[King of Bohemia]]\n** The [[Electorate of the Palatinate|Count Palatine of the Rhine]]\n** The [[Electorate of Saxony|Duke of Saxony]]\n** The [[Margraviate of Brandenburg|Margrave of Brandenburg]]\n\nThe three Archbishops oversaw the most venerable and powerful [[Episcopal see|see]]s in Germany, while the other four were supposed to represent the dukes of the four nations. The Count Palatine of the Rhine held most of the former Duchy of Franconia after the last Duke died in 1039. The Margrave of Brandenburg became an Elector when the Duchy of Swabia was dissolved after the last Duke of Swabia was beheaded in 1268. Saxony, even with diminished territory, retained its eminent position.\n\nThe Palatinate and Bavaria were originally held by the same individual, but in 1253, they were divided between two members of the [[House of Wittelsbach]]. The other electors refused to allow two princes from the same dynasty to have electoral rights, so a heated rivalry arose between the Count Palatine and the Duke of Bavaria over who should hold the Wittelsbach seat.\n\nMeanwhile, the King of Bohemia, who held the ancient imperial office of Arch-Cupbearer, asserted his right to participate in elections. Sometimes he was challenged on the grounds that his kingdom was not German, though usually he was recognized, instead of Bavaria which after all was just a younger line of Wittelsbachs.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe [[Declaration of Rhense]] issued in 1338 had the effect that election by the majority of the electors automatically conferred the royal title and rule over the empire, without papal confirmation. The [[Golden Bull of 1356]] finally resolved the disputes among the electors. Under it, the Archbishops of [[Archbishop of Mainz|Mainz]], [[Archbishop of Trier|Trier]], and [[Electorate of Cologne|Cologne]], as well as the [[King of Bohemia]], the [[Electorate of the Palatinate|Count Palatine of the Rhine]], the [[Duke of Saxony]], and the [[Margrave of Brandenburg]] held the right to elect the King.\n\n[[File:Westfaelischer Friede in Muenster (Gerard Terborch 1648).jpg|thumb|300px|right|''The Ratification of the Treaty of M\u00fcnster'' by Gerard Terborch, 1648.]]\n\nThe college's composition remained unchanged until the 17th century, although the Electorate of Saxony was transferred from the senior to the junior branch of the Wettin family in 1547, in the aftermath of the [[Schmalkaldic War]].\n\n=== Thirty Years' War to Napoleon ===\n\nIn 1621, the Elector Palatine, [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine|Frederick V]], came under the [[imperial ban]] after participating in the [[Thirty Years' War#The Bohemian Revolt|Bohemian Revolt]] (a part of the [[Thirty Years' War]]). The Elector Palatine's seat was conferred on the Duke of Bavaria, the head of a junior branch of his family. Originally, the Duke held the electorate personally, but it was later made hereditary along with the duchy. When the Thirty Years' War concluded with the [[Peace of Westphalia]] in 1648, a new electorate was created for the Count Palatine of the Rhine. Since the Elector of Bavaria retained his seat, the number of electors increased to eight; the two Wittelsbach lines now sufficiently estranged so as not to pose a combined potential threat.\n\nIn 1685, the religious composition of the College of Electors was disrupted when a Catholic branch of the Wittelsbach family inherited the Palatinate. A new Protestant electorate was created in 1692 for the Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg, who became known as the Elector of Hanover (the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] officially confirmed the creation in 1708). The Elector of Saxony converted to Catholicism in 1697 so that he could become King of Poland, but no additional Protestant electors were created. Although the Elector of Saxony was personally Catholic, the Electorate itself remained officially Protestant, and the Elector even remained the leader of the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)#Religious bodies|Protestant body in the Reichstag]].\n\nIn 1706, the Elector of Bavaria and Archbishop of Cologne were [[Imperial ban|banned]] during the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], but both were restored in 1714 after the [[Treaty of Baden (1714)|Peace of Baden]]. In 1777, the number of electors was reduced to eight when the Elector Palatine inherited Bavaria.\n\nMany changes to the composition of the college were necessitated by [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]'s aggression during the early 19th century. The [[Treaty of Lun\u00e9ville]] (1801), which ceded territory on the [[Rhine]]'s left bank to [[France]], led to the abolition of the archbishoprics of Trier and Cologne, and the transfer of the remaining spiritual Elector from Mainz to [[Regensburg]]. In 1803, electorates were created for the [[Rulers of W\u00fcrttemberg|Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg]], the [[Margrave of Baden]], the [[Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel]], and the [[Duchy of Salzburg|Duke of Salzburg]], bringing the total number of electors to ten. When [[Austria]] annexed Salzburg under the [[Treaty of Pressburg (1805)]], the Duke of Salzburg moved to the [[Grand Duchy of W\u00fcrzburg]] and retained his electorate. None of the new electors, however, had an opportunity to cast votes, as the Holy Roman Empire was abolished in 1806, and the new electorates were never confirmed by the Emperor.\n\n=== After the Empire ===\n\nAfter the abolition of the Holy Roman Empire in August 1806, the Electors continued to reign over their territories, many of them taking higher titles. The Electors of Bavaria, W\u00fcrttemberg, and Saxony styled themselves Kings, while the Electors of Baden, Hesse-Darmstadt, [[Karl Theodor Anton Maria von Dalberg|Regensburg]], and [[Ferdinand III, Grand Duke of Tuscany|W\u00fcrzburg]] became Grand Dukes. The Elector of Hesse-Kassel, however, retained the meaningless title \"Elector of Hesse\", thus distinguishing himself from other Hessian princes (the Grand Duke of Hesse-Darmstadt and the Landgrave of Hesse-Homburg). Napoleon soon exiled him and Kassel was annexed to the [[Kingdom of Westphalia]], a new creation. The King of Great Britain remained at war with Napoleon and continued to style himself Elector of Hanover, while the Hanoverian government continued to operate in London.\n\nThe [[Congress of Vienna]] accepted the Electors of Bavaria, W\u00fcrttemberg, and Saxony as Kings, along with the newly created Grand Dukes. The Elector of Hanover finally joined his fellow Electors by declaring himself the King of Hanover. The restored Elector of Hesse, a Napoleonic creation, tried to be recognized as the King of the [[Chatti]]. However, the European powers refused to acknowledge this title at the [[Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle (1818)]] and instead listed him with the [[grand duchy|grand dukes]] as a \"Royal Highness\".<ref name=\"satow1932\">{{cite book|last1=Satow|first1=Ernest Mason|title=A Guide to Diplomatic Practice|date=1932|publisher=Longmans|location=London}}</ref> Believing the title of Prince-Elector to be superior in dignity to that of Grand Duke, the Elector of Hesse-Kassel chose to remain an Elector, even though there was no longer a Holy Roman Emperor to elect. Hesse-Kassel remained the only Electorate in Germany until 1866, when the country backed the losing side in the [[Austro-Prussian War]] and was absorbed into Prussia.\n\n==Confessional balance==\n\nReligion was a factor in the election of the Holy Roman Emperor, as some [[Protestant]] electors would refuse to vote for a [[Roman Catholic]] and [[vice versa]]. Most of the time, religion played a minor role and was overshadowed by other factors, including dynastic, territorial and other political interests. For example, the Protestant [[Elector of Saxony]] voted for [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II, Archduke of Austria]], putting his political interests first even though Ferdinand was a staunch [[Roman Catholic]] who would eventually lead the Empire into the [[Thirty Years' War]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nAt the height of the [[Protestant Reformation]], there were times when the electoral college had a Protestant majority. However, all of the Holy Roman Emperors were Catholic. Some historians maintain that [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand III]] had been touched by the reformed philosophies and was probably the closest the Holy Roman Empire ever came to a Protestant emperor; he remained nominally a Catholic throughout his life, although reportedly he refused last rites on his deathbed.<ref>See Parker, pp. 20\u201350.</ref> Other historians maintain he was as Catholic as his brother, but tended to see religion as outside the political sphere.<ref>Holborn, pp. 250\u2013251.</ref>\n\n===Spiritual===\n\n*The [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Elector of Mainz]] was always a [[Roman Catholic]].\n*The [[Electorate of Trier|Elector of Trier]]  was always a [[Roman Catholic]].\n*The [[Electorate of Cologne|Elector of Cologne]] was usually a [[Roman Catholic]], with the exception of [[Hermann V von Wied]] ([[Lutheran]], 1542\u20131546) and [[Gebhard Truchsess von Waldburg]] ([[Calvinist]], 1582\u20131588).\n\n===Secular===\n*The [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Elector of Bohemia]] was usually a [[Roman Catholic]], with the exception of [[George of Podebrady]] ([[Hussite]], 1457\u20131471) and [[Frederick I, Elector Palatine|Frederick I]] ([[Calvinist]], 1619\u20131620).\n*The [[Margraviate of Brandenburg|Elector of Brandenburg]], who was also [[List of monarchs of Prussia|Duke of Prussia]] from 1618 (King in Prussia from 1701, King of Prussia from 1772), was a [[Roman Catholic]] until 1539, then a [[Lutheran]] until 1613, then a [[Calvinist]] until the end of the Empire.\n*The [[Electoral Palatinate|Elector Palatine]] was a [[Roman Catholic]] until the 1530s, then a [[Lutheran]] until 1559, then a [[Calvinist]] until 1575, then again a [[Lutheran]] until 1583, then again a [[Calvinist]] until 1623, when the electoral dignity was lost to [[Electoral Bavaria|Bavaria]].\n*The [[Electorate of Saxony|Elector of Saxony]] was a [[Roman Catholic]] until 1525, then a [[Lutheran]] until 1697, and then again a [[Roman Catholic]].\n\n===Added in the 17th century===\n*The [[Electorate of Bavaria|Elector of Bavaria]] was always a [[Roman Catholic]].\n*The [[Elector of Hanover]], was a [[Lutheran]] until 1714, when he became [[List of British monarchs|King of Great Britain]] and also the head of the [[Anglican]] [[Church of England]] and the [[Calvinist]] [[Church of Scotland]].\n\n===Added in the 19th century===\n*The [[Principality of Regensburg|Elector of Regensburg]] [[Karl Theodor Anton Maria von Dalberg]] was a [[Roman Catholic]].\n*The [[Electorate of Salzburg|Elector of Salzburg]] (1803\u20131805) and [[Grand Duchy of W\u00fcrzburg|W\u00fcrzburg]] (1805\u20131806) [[Ferdinand III, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Ferdinand III and I]] was a [[Roman Catholic]].\n*The [[Electorate of W\u00fcrttemberg|Elector of W\u00fcrttemberg]] [[Frederick I of W\u00fcrttemberg|Frederick I]] was a [[Lutheran]].\n*The [[Electorate of Baden|Elector of Baden]] [[Charles Frederick, Grand Duke of Baden|Charles Frederick]] was a [[Lutheran]].\n*The [[Electorate of Hesse|Elector of Hesse]] [[William I, Elector of Hesse|William I]] was a [[Calvinist]].\n\n==Coats of arms==\nCoat of arms of the states granted the electoral dignity:\n\nThree ecclesiastic/spiritual electors (archbishops):\n\n<gallery widths=\"100px\" heights=\"100px\" perrow=\"4\">\nFile:Coat_of_arms_of_the_Archbishopric_of_Mainz_(1250).svg|Archbishop of Mainz\nFile:Trier_Arms.svg|Archbishop of Trier\nFile:COA Kurkoeln.svg|Archbishop of Cologne\n</gallery>\n\nFour secular electors:\n\n<gallery widths=\"100px\" heights=\"100px\" perrow=\"4\">\nFile:Blason_Boheme.svg|Kingdom of Bohemia\nFile:Arms_of_the_Palatinate_(Bavaria-Palatinate).svg|County Palatine of the Rhine\nFile:Coat_of_arms_of_Saxony.svg|Duchy of Saxony\nFile:Armoiries_\u00e9lecteur_Brandebourg.svg|Margraviate of Brandenburg\n</gallery>\n\nElectors added in 17th century:\n\n<gallery widths=\"100px\" heights=\"100px\" perrow=\"4\">\nFile:Bavaria_Arms.svg|Duchy of Bavaria was granted electoral dignity by [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]] in 1623, removing the dignity from the County Palatine of the Rhine\nCoat_of_Arms_of_George_I_Louis,_Elector_of_Hanover_(1708-1714).svg|[[Electorate of Hanover]] (Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg), made an elector by [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]] in 1692 as a reward for aid given in the [[War of the Grand Alliance]]\n</gallery>\n\nDuring the collapse of the Holy Roman Empire, between 1803 and 1806:\n\n<gallery widths=\"100px\" heights=\"100px\" perrow=\"6\">\nFile:Wappen_Regensburg.svg|Principality of Regensburg was added in 1803, after the annexation of Mainz by the French\nFile:Kursalzburg.png|Grand Duchy of Salzburg was added in 1803.

He spent the rest of the 1930s and much of the 1940s setting multiple [[Flight airspeed record|world air speed records]] and building the [[Hughes H-1 Racer]] and [[H-4 Hercules]] (the ''Spruce Goose''). He acquired and expanded [[Trans World Airlines]] and later acquired [[Hughes Airwest|Air West]], renaming it [[Hughes Airwest]].

The date remains uncertain due to conflicting dates from various sources. He repeatedly claimed that his birthday was on Christmas Eve. A 1941 [[affidavit]] [[birth certificate]] of Hughes that was signed by his aunt Annette Gano Lummis and Estelle Boughton Sharp states that he was born on December 24, 1905, in [[Harris County, Texas]].{{#tag:ref|No time of birth is listed.

The senior Hughes made the shrewd and lucrative decision to commercialize the invention by leasing the bits instead of selling them, obtained several early patents, and founded the [[Hughes Tool Company]] in 1909. Hughes' uncle was the famed novelist, screenwriter, and film director [[Rupert Hughes]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.anb.org/articles/10/10-01809.html|title=American National Biography Online: Hughes, Howard|website=www.anb.org|access-date=August 15, 2017}}</ref>\n\nAt a young age, Hughes demonstrated an interest in science and technology.

He often scored near par figures, played the game to a three handicap during his 20s, and for a time aimed for a professional golf career. He golfed frequently with top players, including [[Gene Sarazen]]. Hughes rarely played competitively and gradually gave up his passion for the sport to pursue other interests.<ref>Barkow 1986, p. 13.</ref>\n\nHughes withdrew from [[Rice University]] shortly after his father's death. On June 1, 1925, he married Ella Botts Rice, daughter of David Rice and Martha Lawson Botts of Houston. They moved to Los Angeles, where he hoped to make a name for himself as a filmmaker.\n\n==Business career==\n{{Main|Summa Corporation}}\nHughes enjoyed a highly successful business career beyond engineering, aviation, and filmmaking, though many of his career endeavors involved varying entrepreneurial roles. The Summa Corporation was the name adopted for the business interests of Howard Hughes after he sold the tool division of [[Hughes Tool Company]] in 1972. The company serves as the principal holding company for Hughes' business ventures and investments. It is primarily involved in aerospace and defense, electronics, mass media, manufacturing, and hospitality industries, but has maintained a strong presence in a wide variety of industries including real estate, petroleum drilling and oilfield services, consulting, entertainment, and engineering. Much of his fortune was later used for philanthropic causes, notably towards health care and medical research.\n\n===Entertainment===\nHughes entered the entertainment industry after dropping out of Rice University and moving to Los Angeles. His first two films, ''Everybody's Acting'' (1927) and ''[[Two Arabian Knights]]'' (1928), were financial successes, the latter winning the first [[Academy Award for Best Director]] of a comedy picture. ''[[The Racket (1928 film)|The Racket]]'' (1928) and ''[[The Front Page (1931 film)|The Front Page]]'' (1931) were also nominated for [[Academy Awards]].\n\nHughes spent $3.8&nbsp;million to make the flying film ''[[Hell's Angels (film)|Hell's Angels]]'' (1930). It earned nearly $8 million, about double the production and advertising costs.{{Clarify|reason=as figures differ from Wikipedia's discreet \"Hell's Angels\" entry.|date=February 2018}} ''Hell's Angels'' received one [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]]. He produced another hit, ''[[Scarface (1932 film)|Scarface]]'' (1932), a production delayed by censors' concern over its violence.\n\n''[[The Outlaw]]'' (1943) was completed in 1941 and featured [[Jane Russell]]. It also received considerable attention from industry censors, this time owing to Russell's revealing costumes. Hughes designed a special [[bra]] for his leading lady, although Russell said it was uncomfortable and decided against wearing it.\n\n====RKO====\n{{Main|RKO Pictures}}\n\n[[File:Howard-Hughes-TIME-1948.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Hughes on the cover of [[TIME Magazine]], July 1948 (with [[Spruce Goose]] on the background)]]\n\nDuring the 1940s to the late 1950s, the Hughes Tool Company ventured into the film industry when it obtained partial ownership of the RKO companies which included RKO Pictures, RKO Studios, a chain of movie theaters known as RKO Theatres and a network of radio stations known as the RKO Radio Network.\n\nIn 1948, Hughes gained control of [[RKO]], a struggling major Hollywood studio, by acquiring 25% of the outstanding stock from [[Floyd Odlum]]'s [[Atlas Corporation]]. Within weeks of acquiring the studio, Hughes dismissed three-quarters of the work force and production was shut down for six months during which time investigations were conducted of each employee who remained with RKO as far as their political leanings were concerned. Only after ensuring that the stars under contract to RKO had no suspect affiliations would Hughes approve completed pictures to be sent back for re-shooting. This was especially true of the women who were under contract to RKO at that time. If Hughes felt that his stars did not properly represent the political views of his liking or if a film's [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] politics were not sufficiently clear, he pulled the plug. In 1952, an abortive sale to a Chicago-based group connected to the mafia with no experience in the industry also disrupted studio operations at RKO even further.\n\nIn 1953, Hughes was involved with a high profile lawsuit as part of the settlement of the ''[[United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.]]'' [[Antitrust]] Case. As a result of the hearings, the shaky status of RKO became increasingly apparent. A steady stream of lawsuits from RKO's minority shareholders had grown to be extremely annoying to Hughes. They had accused him of financial misconduct and corporate mismanagement. Since Hughes wanted to focus primarily on his aircraft manufacturing and TWA holdings during the [[Korean War]] years, Hughes offered to buy out all other stockholders in order to dispense with their distractions.\n\nBy the end of 1954 Hughes had gained near-total control of RKO at a cost of nearly $24&nbsp;million, becoming the closest thing to a sole owner of a Hollywood studio seen in three decades. Six months later, Hughes sold the studio to the [[General Tire and Rubber Company]] for $25&nbsp;million. Hughes retained the rights to pictures that he had personally produced, including those made at RKO. He also retained Jane Russell's contract. For Howard Hughes, this was the virtual end of his 25-year involvement in the motion picture industry. However, his reputation as a financial wizard emerged unscathed. During that time period, RKO became known as the home of film noir classic productions thanks in part to the limited budgets required to make such films during Hughes' tenure. Hughes reportedly walked away from RKO having made $6.5&nbsp;million in personal profit.<ref>Lasky 1989, p. 229.</ref>\n\nGeneral Tire was interested mainly in exploiting the value of the RKO library for television programming even though it made some attempts to continue producing films. After a year and a half of mixed success, General Tire shut down film production entirely at RKO at the end of January 1957. The studio lots in Hollywood and [[Culver City]] were sold to [[Desilu Productions]] later that year for $6.15&nbsp;million.\n\n===Real estate===\n{{main|Howard Hughes Corporation}}\n\nBeyond extending his business prowess in the manufacturing, aviation, entertainment, and hospitality industries, Hughes was a successful [[real estate]] investor. Hughes was deeply involved in the American real estate industry where he amassed vast holdings of undeveloped land both in [[Las Vegas]] and in the desert surrounding the city that had gone unused during his lifetime. In 1968, the [[Hughes Tool Company]] purchased the North Las Vegas Air Terminal.\n\nOriginally known as Summa Corporation, The Howard Hughes Corporation was formed in 1972 when the oil tools business of Hughes Tool Company, then owned by Howard Hughes Jr., was floated on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] under the Hughes Tool name. This forced the remaining businesses of the \"original\" Hughes Tool to adopt a new corporate name Summa. The name \"Summa\"{{emdash}}Latin for \"highest\"{{emdash}}was adopted without the approval of Hughes himself, who preferred to keep his own name on the business, and suggested HRH Properties (for Hughes Resorts and Hotels, and also his own initials). In 1988, Summa announced plans for [[Summerlin, Nevada|Summerlin]], a master-planned community named for the paternal grandmother of Howard Hughes, Jean Amelia Summerlin.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nInitially staying in the [[Desert Inn]], Hughes refused to vacate his room, and instead decided to purchase the entire hotel. Hughes extended his financial empire to include Las Vegas real estate, hotels, and media outlets, spending an estimated $300 million, and using his considerable powers to take-over many of the well known hotels, especially the [[Organized crime in the United States|organized crime]] connected venues. He quickly became one of the most powerful men in Las Vegas. He was instrumental in changing the image of Las Vegas from its [[Wild West]] roots into a more refined cosmopolitan city.\n\n===Aviation and aerospace===\n[[File:Howard Hughes.jpg|thumb|Hughes with his [[Boeing 100]] in the 1940s]]\n\nAnother portion of Hughes' business interests lay in aviation, airlines, and the aerospace and defense industries. Hughes was a lifelong aircraft enthusiast and pilot. He survived four airplane accidents: one while filming ''Hell's Angels'', one while setting the air speed record in the Hughes Racer, one at Lake Mead in 1943, and the near fatal crash of the Hughes XF-11 in 1946. At Rogers Airport in Los Angeles, he learned to fly from pioneer aviators, including [[Moye Stephens]]. He set many world records and commissioned the construction of custom aircraft for himself while heading [[Hughes Aircraft]] at the [[Grand Central Airport (United States)|airport in Glendale]], CA. Operating from there, the most technologically important aircraft he commissioned was the [[Hughes H-1 Racer]]. On September 13, 1935, Hughes, flying the H-1, set the landplane [[Flight airspeed record|airspeed record]] of {{convert|352|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} over his test course near [[Santa Ana, California]] ([[Giuseppe Motta (aviator)|Giuseppe Motta]] reached 362&nbsp;mph in 1929 and [[George Stainforth]] reached 407.5&nbsp;mph in 1931, both in seaplanes). This was the last time in history that the world airspeed record was set in an aircraft built by a private individual. A year and a half later, on January 19, 1937, flying the same H-1 Racer fitted with longer wings, Hughes set a new [[transcontinental airspeed record]] by flying non-stop from Los Angeles to Newark in seven hours, 28 minutes, and 25 seconds (beating his own previous record of nine hours, 27 minutes). His average ground speed over the flight was {{convert|322|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.<ref>Onkst, David H.

Retrieved: January 5, 2008.</ref>\n\nThe H-1 Racer featured a number of design innovations: it had retractable landing gear (as [[Boeing Monomail]] had five years before) and all rivets and joints set flush into the body of the aircraft to reduce drag. The H-1 Racer is thought to have influenced the design of a number of [[World War II]] fighters such as the [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero]], [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190]], and [[F8F Bearcat]],<ref>[http://www.wrightools.com/hughes/h1_history.htm \"Aviator Howard Hughes H-1 Racer History.\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050830082007/http://www.wrightools.com/hughes/h1_history.htm |date=August 30, 2005 }} ''wrightools.com''. Retrieved: January 5, 2008.</ref> although that has never been reliably confirmed. The H-1 Racer was donated to the [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian]] in 1975 and is on display at the [[National Air and Space Museum]].\n\n====Round-the-world flight====\nOn July 14, 1938, Hughes set another record by completing a flight around the world in just 91 hours (three days, 19 hours, 17 minutes), beating the previous record set in 1933 by [[Wiley Post]] in a single engine [[Lockheed Vega]] by almost four days. Hughes returned home ahead of photographs of his flight. Taking off from [[New York City]], Hughes continued to [[Paris]], [[Moscow]], [[Omsk]], [[Yakutsk]], [[Fairbanks, Alaska|Fairbanks]], [[Minneapolis]], then returning to New York City. For this flight he flew a [[Lockheed Model 14 Super Electra|Lockheed 14 Super Electra]] (NX18973, a twin-engine transport with a four-man crew) fitted with the latest radio and navigational equipment. Hughes wanted the flight to be a triumph of American aviation technology, illustrating that safe, long-distance air travel was possible. Albert Lodwick of [[Mystic, Iowa]] provided organizational skills as the [[Flight operations quality assurance|flight operations]] manager.<ref>{{cite web | title = Around the World in 91 Hours | url = http://www.historicalmarkerproject.com/markers/HM1P4Z_around-the-world-in-91-hours_Centerville-IA.html | work = Historical Marker Project website | accessdate = July 27, 2016}}</ref> While he had previously been relatively obscure despite his wealth, being better known for dating [[Katharine Hepburn]], New York City now gave Hughes a [[ticker-tape parade]] in the [[Canyon of Heroes]].<ref name=\"life19380725\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=n08EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PA9#v=onepage \"A Rich Young Texan with a Poet's Face Gets Hero's Welcome on World Flight.\"] ''Life '', July 25, 1938, pp. 9\u201311, 14.

The project was opposed by the military services, thinking it would siphon resources from higher priority programs, but was advocated by Hughes' powerful allies in Washington, D.C. After disputes, Kaiser withdrew from the project and Hughes elected to continue it as the H-4 Hercules. However, the aircraft was not completed until after the end of World War II.<ref>Parker 2013, pp. 49\u201358.</ref><ref>Herman 2012, pp. 277\u2013280.</ref>\n\nThe Hercules was the world's largest flying boat, the largest aircraft made from wood,<ref>[http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/design/q0188.shtml \"Largest Plane in the World.\"] ''Aerospaceweb.org'' .

''Building Victory: Aircraft Manufacturing in the Los Angeles Area in World War II,'' pp. 58, Cypress, CA, 2013.</ref>\n\nThe Hercules was nicknamed the ''Spruce Goose'' by its critics, but it was actually made largely from [[birch]], not [[spruce]], rather than of aluminum, because the contract required that Hughes build the aircraft of \"non-[[strategic material]]s\". It was built in Hughes' [[Westchester, California]], facility. In 1947, Howard Hughes was summoned to testify before the [[Senate War Investigating Committee]] to explain why the H-4 development had been so troubled, and why $22 million had produced only two prototypes of the XF-11. General Elliott Roosevelt and numerous other USAAF officers were also called to testify in hearings that transfixed the nation during August and November 1947. In hotly disputed testimony over [[Trans World Airlines|TWA]]'s route awards and malfeasance in the defense acquisition process, Hughes turned the tables on his main interlocutor, Maine Senator [[Owen Brewster]], and the hearings were widely interpreted as a Hughes victory. After being displayed at the harbor of Long Beach, California, the Hercules was moved to [[McMinnville, Oregon]], where it is now part of the [[Evergreen Aviation & Space Museum]].<ref>[http://www.evergreenmuseum.org/the-museum/aircraft-exhibits/the-spruce-goose/ \"Spruce Goose.\"] ''Evergreen Aviation and Space Museum''.

During and after World War II, Hughes fashioned his company into a major defense contractor. The [[Hughes Helicopters]] division started in 1947 when [[helicopter]] manufacturer [[Kellett Autogiro Corporation|Kellett]] sold their latest design to Hughes for production. The company was a major American aerospace and defense contractor manufacturing numerous technology related products that include spacecraft vehicles, military aircraft, radar systems, electro-optical systems, the first working laser, aircraft computer systems, missile systems, ion-propulsion engines (for space travel), commercial satellites, and other electronics systems.\n\nIn 1948, Hughes created a new division of the company: the [[Hughes Aerospace#Hughes Aerospace Group|Hughes Aerospace]] Group. The Hughes Space and Communications Group and the Hughes Space Systems Division were later spun off in 1948 to form their own divisions and ultimately became the [[Hughes Space and Communications Company#Hughes Space and Communications|Hughes Space and Communications Company]] in 1961. In 1953, Howard Hughes gave all his stock in the Hughes Aircraft Company to the newly formed Howard Hughes Medical Institute, thereby turning the aerospace and defense contractor into a tax-exempt charitable organization. The Howard Hughes Medical Institute sold Hughes Aircraft in 1985 to General Motors for $5.2 billion. In 1997, General Motors sold Hughes Aircraft to [[Raytheon]] and in 2000, sold Hughes Space & Communications to Boeing. A combination of Boeing, GM, and [[Raytheon]] acquired the [[Hughes Research Laboratories]], where it focused on advanced developments in microelectronics, information & systems sciences, materials, sensors, and photonics; their workspace spans from basic research to product delivery. It has particularly emphasized capabilities in high performance integrated circuits, high power lasers, antennas, networking, and smart materials.\n\n====Airlines====\nIn 1939, at the urging of [[Jack Frye]], president of [[Trans World Airlines]] ([[TWA]]), Hughes began to quietly purchase a majority share of TWA stock, and took a controlling interest in the airline by 1944.<ref name=\":1\">Bartlett and Steele 2011, p. 216.</ref> Although he never had an official position with TWA, Hughes handpicked the board of directors, and often issued orders directly to airline staff.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.stlmag.com/TWA-Death-Of-A-Legend/|title=TWA \u2013 Death Of A Legend|last=Grant|first=Elaine X.|date=July 28, 2006|work=St. Louis Magazine|access-date=January 10, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>\n[[File:Lockheed L-1049G Super Constellation, Trans World Airlines (TWA) JP7078570.jpg|thumb|Lockheed Constellation in TWA livery]]\nHughes is commonly credited as the driving force behind the [[Lockheed Constellation]] airliner, which Hughes and Frye ordered in 1939 as a long-range replacement for TWA's fleet of [[Boeing 307|Boeing 307 Stratoliner]]s, Hughes personally financed TWA's acquisition of 40 Constellations for $18 million, the largest aircraft order in history up to that time. The Constellations were among the highest-performing commercial aircraft of the late 1940s and 1950s, and allowed TWA to pioneer nonstop transcontinental service.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://airwaysmag.com/best-of-airways/howard-hughes-twas-constellations/|title=Howard Hughes and TWA\u00b4S Constellations \u2013 Airways Magazine|date=June 6, 2016|work=Airways Magazine|access-date=January 10, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> During World War II, Hughes leveraged political connections in Washington to obtain rights for TWA to serve Europe, making it the only U.S. carrier with a combination of domestic and transatlantic routes.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAfter the [[Boeing 707]] was announced, Hughes opted to pursue a more unique jet aircraft for TWA and approached [[Convair]] in late 1954. Convair proposed two concepts to Hughes, but Hughes was unable to decide which concept to adopt, and Convair eventually abandoned its initial jet project after the mockups of the 707 and [[Douglas DC-8]] were unveiled.<ref>Barlett and Steele 2011, pp. 218\u2013219.</ref> Even after competitors such as [[United Airlines]], [[American Airlines]] and [[Pan American World Airways]] had placed large orders for the 707, Hughes only placed eight orders for 707s through the Hughes Tool Company and forbade TWA from using the aircraft.<ref name=\":2\" /> After finally beginning to reserve 707 orders in 1956, Hughes embarked on a plan to build his own \"superior\" jet aircraft for TWA, applied for [[Civil Aeronautics Board|CAB]] permission to sell Hughes aircraft to TWA, and began negotiations with the state of Florida to build a manufacturing plant there. However, he abandoned this plan around 1958, and in the interim, negotiated new contracts for 707 and [[Convair 880]] aircraft and engines totaling $400 million.<ref>Barlett and Steele 2011, pp. 219\u2013222.</ref>\n\nThe financing of TWA's jet orders precipitated the end of Hughes' relationship with [[Noah Dietrich]], and ultimately Hughes's ouster from control of TWA. Hughes did not have enough cash on hand or future cash flow to pay for the orders, and did not immediately seek bank financing. Hughes's refusal to heed Dietrich's financing advice led to a major rift between the two by the end of 1956. Hughes believed that Dietrich wished to have Hughes committed as mentally incompetent, although the evidence of this is inconclusive. Dietrich resigned by telephone in May 1957 after repeated requests for stock options, which Hughes refused to grant, and with no further progress on the jet financing.<ref>Barlett and Steele 2011, p. 224-228.</ref> As Hughes's mental state worsened, he ordered various tactics to delay payments to Boeing and Convair; his behavior led TWA's banks to insist that he be removed from management as a condition for further financing.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIn 1960, Hughes was ultimately forced out of management of TWA, although he continued to own 78% of the company. In 1961, TWA filed suit against Hughes Tool Company, claiming that the latter had violated antitrust law by using TWA as a captive market for aircraft trading. The claim was largely dependent upon obtaining testimony from Hughes himself. Hughes went into hiding and refused to testify. A default judgment was issued against Hughes Tool Company for $135 million in 1963, but was overturned by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in 1973, on the basis that Hughes was immune from prosecution.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/12/23/archives/just-about-everybody-versus-howard-hughes-the-strange-case-of-twa.html|title=The strange case of T.W.A. vs. Howard Hughes vs. T.W.A.|last=Brooks|first=John|date=December 23, 1973|work=The New York Times|access-date=January 10, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> In 1966, a U.S. federal court forced Hughes to sell his TWA shares because of concerns over [[conflict of interest]] between his ownership of both TWA and Hughes Aircraft.

After his death in 1976, many thought that the balance of Hughes' estate would go to the institute, although it was ultimately divided among his cousins and other heirs, given the lack of a will to the contrary.

He also proposed to [[Joan Fontaine]] several times, according to her autobiography ''No Bed of Roses''. [[Jean Harlow]] accompanied him to the premiere of ''Hell's Angels'', but [[Noah Dietrich]] wrote many years later that the relationship was strictly professional, as Hughes apparently personally disliked Harlow. In his 1971 book, ''Howard: The Amazing Mr. Hughes'', Dietrich said that Hughes genuinely liked and respected [[Jane Russell]], but never sought romantic involvement with her. According to Russell's autobiography, however, Hughes once tried to bed her after a party. Russell (who was married at the time) refused him, and Hughes promised it would never happen again. The two maintained a professional and private friendship for many years. Hughes remained good friends with Tierney who, after his failed attempts to seduce her, was quoted as saying \"I don't think Howard could love anything that did not have a motor in it.\" Later, when Tierney's daughter Daria was born deaf and blind and with a severe [[learning disability]] because of Tierney's being exposed to [[rubella]] during her pregnancy, Hughes saw to it that Daria received the best medical care and paid all expenses.<ref>Tierney and Herskowitz 1978, p. 97.</ref>\n\n===Buys luxury yacht, fatal car accident===\nIn 1933, Hughes made a purchase of an unseen luxury steam yacht named the ''[[Rover (yacht)|Rover]]'', which was previously owned by British shipping magnate [[James Mackay, 1st Earl of Inchcape|Lord Inchcape]]. \"I have never seen the ''Rover'' but bought it on the blue prints, photographs and the reports of Lloyd's surveyors.

He wrote a detailed memorandum to the crew on how to fix the problem. [[Richard Fleischer]], who directed ''[[His Kind of Woman]]'' with Hughes as executive producer, wrote at length in his autobiography about the difficulty of dealing with the tycoon. In his book, ''Just Tell Me When to Cry'', Fleischer explained that Hughes was fixated on trivial details and was alternately indecisive and obstinate. He also revealed that Hughes' unpredictable [[mood swing]]s made him wonder if the film would ever be completed.\n\nIn 1958, Hughes told his aides that he wanted to screen some movies at a film studio near his home. He stayed in the studio's darkened screening room for more than four months, never leaving. He ate only [[chocolate]] bars and chicken and drank only [[milk]], and was surrounded by dozens of [[Kleenex]] boxes that he continuously stacked and re-arranged. He wrote detailed memos to his aides giving them explicit instructions neither to look at him nor speak to him unless spoken to. Throughout this period, Hughes sat fixated in his chair, often naked, continually watching movies. When he finally emerged in the summer of 1958, his hygiene was terrible. He had neither bathed nor cut his hair and nails for weeks; this may have been due to [[allodynia]], which results in a pain response to stimuli that would normally not cause pain.<ref name=PPM.Tennant/>\n\nAfter the screening room incident, Hughes moved into a [[bungalow]] at the [[Beverly Hills Hotel]] where he also rented rooms for his aides, his wife, and numerous girlfriends. He would sit naked in his bedroom with a pink hotel napkin placed over his genitals, watching movies. This may have been because Hughes found the touch of clothing painful due to allodynia. He may have watched movies to distract himself from his pain\u2014a common practice among patients with intractable pain, especially those who do not receive adequate treatment.<ref name=PPM.Tennant/> In one year, Hughes spent an estimated $11&nbsp;million at the hotel.\n\nHughes began purchasing all restaurant chains and four star hotels that had been founded within the state of [[Texas]]. This included, if for only a short period, many unknown franchises currently out of business. He placed ownership of the restaurants with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and all licenses were resold shortly after.\n\nAnother time, he became obsessed with the 1968 film ''[[Ice Station Zebra]]'', and had it run on a continuous loop in his home. According to his aides, he watched it 150 times.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,918526,00.html|title=TYCOONS: The Secret Life of Howard Hughes|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|publisher=[[TIME Inc.]]|location=New York City|date=December 13, 1976|accessdate=March 13, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Dave|last=Kehr|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/11/movies/11dvd.html|title=New DVDs: 'Ice Station Zebra'|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=New York Times Company|location=New York City|date=January 11, 2005|accessdate=November 8, 2013}}</ref>\n\nHughes insisted on using tissues to pick up objects to insulate himself from germs. He would also notice dust, stains, or other imperfections on people's clothes and demand that they take care of them. Once one of the most visible men in America, Hughes ultimately vanished from public view, although tabloids continued to follow rumors of his behavior and whereabouts. He was reported to be terminally ill, mentally unstable, or even dead.\n\nInjuries from numerous aircraft crashes caused Hughes to spend much of his later life in pain, and he eventually became addicted to [[codeine]], which he injected [[Intramuscular injection|intramuscularly]].<ref name=PPM.Tennant/> Hughes had his hair cut and nails trimmed only once a year, likely due to the pain caused by the [[Complex Regional Pain Syndrome|RSD/CRPS]], which was caused by the plane crashes.<ref name=PPM.Tennant/> He also stored his urine in bottles.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0201/20/lklw.00.html|title=Guests Discuss the Late Howard Hughes|publisher=CNN|date=January 20, 2002|accessdate=May 5, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=William|last=Booth|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A7810-2004Dec17.html|title=Leo and Howard|work=[[The Washington Post]]|publisher=Nash Holdings LLC|location=Washington, DC|date=December 19, 2004|accessdate=May 5, 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[File:1954 Chrysler New Yorker Howard Hughes rear.JPG|thumb|Hughes had this 1954 [[Chrysler New Yorker]] equipped with an aircraft-grade air filtration system that took up the entire trunk.]]\n\n===Later years as a Las Vegas recluse===\nThe wealthy and aging Hughes, accompanied by his entourage of personal aides, began moving from one hotel to another, always taking up residence in the top floor penthouse.

As Hughes wrote in a memo to an aide, \"I like to think of Las Vegas in terms of a well-dressed man in a dinner jacket and a beautifully jeweled and furred female getting out of an expensive car.\" Hughes bought several local television stations (including [[KLAS-TV]]).\n\nHughes' considerable business holdings were overseen by a small panel unofficially dubbed \"The Mormon Mafia\" because of the many [[Latter-day Saint]]s on the committee, led by [[Frank William Gay]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,918528,00.html|title=The Keepers of the King|magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|publisher=[[Time, Inc.]]|location=New York City|date=December 13, 1976|accessdate=January 5, 2008}}</ref> In addition to supervising day-to-day business operations and Hughes' health, they also went to great pains to satisfy Hughes' every whim. For example, Hughes once became fond of [[Baskin-Robbins]]' banana nut ice cream, so his aides sought to secure a bulk shipment for him, only to discover that Baskin-Robbins had discontinued the flavor. They put in a request for the smallest amount the company could provide for a special order, 350 gallons (1,300 L), and had it shipped from Los Angeles.

During the 1960s and early 1970s, he disapproved of underground nuclear testing at the [[Nevada Test Site]]. Hughes was concerned about the risk from residual [[Ionizing radiation|nuclear radiation]], and attempted to halt the tests.

Hughes offered her a settlement of over a million dollars, but she declined it. Hughes did not insist on a [[gag order|confidentiality agreement]] from Peters as a condition of the divorce. Aides reported that Hughes never spoke ill of her. She refused to discuss her life with Hughes and declined several lucrative offers from publishers and biographers.

The so-called \"Mormon Will\" gave $1.56 billion to various charitable organizations (including $625&nbsp;million to the [[Howard Hughes Medical Institute]]), nearly $470&nbsp;million to the upper management in Hughes' companies and to his aides, $156&nbsp;million to first cousin William Lummis, and $156&nbsp;million split equally between his two ex-wives Ella Rice and [[Jean Peters]].\n\nIn this will, Hughes left his entire estate to the Hughes Medical Institute, as he had no connection to family and was seriously ill. This is contrary to the many wills that have surfaced after his death. The original will that included payments to aides never surfaced. It was apparently in a home surrounding the Desert Inn Golf Course belonging to the mother of an assistant. He had no desire to leave any money to family, aides or churches, including William Gay and Frank Morse.<ref>Morse, 1976</ref>{{Full citation needed|date=January 2016}} Hughes was not Mormon and had no reason to leave his estate to that church. Frank P. Morse is still the attorney of record for Hughes.\n\nA further $156&nbsp;million was endowed to a gas-station owner, [[Melvin Dummar]], who told reporters that in 1967, he found a disheveled and dirty man lying along [[U.S. Route 95]], just {{convert|150|mi|km}} north of [[Las Vegas]]. The man asked for a ride to Vegas. Dropping him off at the [[Sands Hotel]], Dummar said the man told him that he was Hughes. Dummar later claimed that days after Hughes' death a \"mysterious man\" appeared at his gas station, leaving an envelope containing the will on his desk. Unsure if the will was genuine and unsure of what to do, Dummar left the will at the LDS Church office. In 1978, a [[Nevada]] court ruled the Mormon Will a forgery, and officially declared that Hughes had died intestate (without a valid will). Dummar's story was later adapted into [[Jonathan Demme]]'s film ''[[Melvin and Howard]]'' in 1980.\n\nHughes' $2.5&nbsp;billion estate was eventually split in 1983 among 22 cousins, including William Lummis, who serves as a trustee of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ruled that [[Hughes Aircraft]] was owned by the [[Howard Hughes Medical Institute]], which sold it to [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] in 1985 for $5.2&nbsp;billion. The court rejected suits by the states of California and Texas that claimed they were owed [[inheritance tax]]. In 1984 Hughes' estate paid an undisclosed amount to [[Terry Moore (actress)|Terry Moore]], who claimed she and Hughes had secretly married on a yacht in [[international waters]] off [[Mexico]] in 1949 and never divorced. Moore never produced proof of a marriage, but her book, ''The Beauty and the Billionaire,'' became a bestseller.\n\n==Awards==\n\n*[[Congressional Gold Medal]] (presented August 7, 1939)\n*[[National Aviation Hall of Fame]] (inducted 1973)\n*[[International Air & Space Hall of Fame]] (inducted 1987)<ref>Sprekelmeyer, Linda, editor.

The town is administered by the municipality of [[Rotterdam]] as a district of that city. Its district covers an area of 16.7&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, of which 13.92&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> is land. On 1 January 1999 it had an estimated population of 9,400.\n\nTowns near \"the Hook\" ({{lang-nl|\"de Hoek\"}}) include [[Monster, Netherlands|Monster]], [['s-Gravenzande]], [[Naaldwijk]] and [[Delft]] to the northeast, and [[Maassluis]] to the southeast. On the other side of the river is the [[Europoort|Europort]] and the [[Maasvlakte]]. The wide sandy beach, one section of which is designated for use by [[naturist]]s, runs for approximately 18 kilometres to [[Scheveningen]] and for most of this distance is backed by extensive [[Sand dune#Coastal dunes|sand dunes]] through which there are foot and cycle paths.\n\nOn the north side of the New Waterway, to the west of the town, is a pier part of which is accessible to pedestrians and cyclists.\n\nThe Berghaven is a small [[harbour]] on the New Waterway where the Rotterdam and Europort [[Maritime pilot|pilots]] are based. This small harbour is only for the use of the pilot service, government vessels and the Hook of Holland [[Lifeboat (rescue)|lifeboat]].\n\nDuring World War II this was one of the most important places for the Germans to hold because of the harbour.\n\n==Transport links==\n\n===Railways===\nThe [[Schiedam\u2013Hoek van Holland railway]] is a 24-kilometre [[branch line]] from [[Schiedam Centrum station]] via [[Vlaardingen]] and [[Maassluis]]. The final two stations on the line are located within the town. [[Hoek van Holland Haven railway station|Hoek van Holland Haven]], the penultimate station, is close to the town centre, adjacent to the ferry terminal and the small harbour, the Berghaven. [[Hoek van Holland Strand railway station|Hoek van Holland Strand]], the terminus, is closest to the beach.\n\nThe railway line opened for service in 1893 and was [[electrification (railway)|electrified]] in 1935. International trains ran from Berlin and Moscow to connect these with London via the ferry service.   Services on the line to [[Rotterdam Centraal station]] were being operated by [[Nederlandse Spoorwegen|NS]] every half hour during the day until April 2017, when the line was closed for conversion to [[rapid transit|metro]] standards. It is expected to reopen in September 2018 as an extension of the [[Rotterdam Metro]], but will not connect directly to Rotterdam Centraal as a change will be necessary.\n\n===Ferry===\nHoek van Holland is also the location of an international [[ferry]] terminal, where service to eastern [[England]] has operated from since 1893, uninterrupted except for during the two [[World Wars]]. Currently, two routes are being operated: one, a day and night freight and passenger service, to [[Harwich International Port|Harwich]], [[Essex]] and the other, a night, freight-only service to [[North Killingholme Haven]], [[Lincolnshire]]. The passenger ferry service is operated by [[Stena Line Holland BV|Stena Line]] as part of the [[Dutchflyer]] rail-ferry service between Hook van Holland Haven station and [[Harwich International railway station|Harwich International station]] in England, from which [[Greater Anglia (train operating company)|Greater Anglia]] provides service to [[Liverpool Street station]] in central [[London]].\n\nA local ferry operated by [[Rotterdamse Elektrische Tram|RET]] links the Hook with the [[Maasvlakte]] part of the [[Port of Rotterdam]].\n\n===Motorways===\nThe [[A20 motorway (Netherlands)|A20 motorway]] begins approximately 10 kilometres east of Hoek van Holland near [[Westerlee, South Holland|Westerlee]], heading east towards [[Rotterdam]] and [[Utrecht]]. It connects to the [[A4 motorway (Netherlands)|A4]] heading north towards the [[The Hague|Hague]] and [[Amsterdam]] 17 kilometres east of the town.\n\n== Notable people ==\n* [[Jan Knippenberg]] (1948 in Hoek van Holland - 1995) a Dutch ultrarunner and historian, in 1974 he ran from Hoek van Holland to Stockholm (1600 km) in 18 days\n* [[Richard de Mos]] (born 1976) a Dutch PVV politician, climate change sceptic, brought up in Hoek van Holland. \n* [[Jesper Leerdam]] (born 1987 in Hoek van Holland) a Dutch footballer currently playing for Dayton Dutch Lions\n* [[Roy Kortsmit]] (born 1992 in Hoek van Holland) a Dutch professional footballer who currently plays as a goalkeeper for Sparta Rotterdam\n* [[Bryan Janssen]] (born 1995 in Hoek van Holland) a Dutch professional footballer who plays for FC Dordrecht, as a goalkeeper\n\n==References==\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist}}\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Hendy|first1=John|last2=Cowsill|first2=Miles|last3=Brown|first3=Stephen|title=Harwich - Hook of Holland 1893-2010|date=2010|publisher=Ferry Publications|location=Ramsey, Isle of Man|isbn=9781906608101}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikivoyage|Hook of Holland}}\n*[http://hoekvanholland.nl/?lang=en Hook of Holland VVV (tourist information) site]\n*[http://www.stenaline.nl/ Harwich - Hoek ferry service]\n\n{{Boroughs of Rotterdam}}\n\n{{Coord|51.9763|4.1323|region:NL_type:city|display=title}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hook Of Holland}}\n[[Category:Rotterdam]]\n[[Category:Boroughs of Rotterdam]]\n[[Category:Populated coastal places in the Netherlands]]\n[[Category:Populated places in South Holland]]\n[[Category:Port cities and towns in the Netherlands]]\n[[Category:Port cities and towns of the North Sea]]", "sha1": "itvqbs6dufwgd7h7tlofu1p5w4abirz"}}, {"title": "Hugh Binning", "ns": "0", "id": "14063", "revision": {"id": "864478670", "parentid": "830178483", "timestamp": "2018-10-17T13:51:22Z", "contributor": {"username": "Tom.Reding", "id": "9784415"}, "minor": "", "comment": "[[WP:AWB/T|typo(s) fixed]]: l\u2019s \u2192 l's (17)", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2015}}\n'''Hugh Binning''' (1627\u20131653) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[philosopher]] and [[Theology|theologian]].  Binning was born in Scotland during the reign of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], ordained in the ([[Presbyterian]]) [[Church of Scotland]] and died during the time of [[Oliver Cromwell]] and the [[Commonwealth of England]].\n\nA precocious child, Binning at age 13 was admitted to the study of philosophy at the [[University of Glasgow]]. By the age of 19, he was appointed regent and professor of philosophy at the University of Glasgow. Three years later, he was called to be minister and presided at a church in [[Govan]], adjacent to the city of [[Glasgow]]; a post he held until his untimely death of [[Consumption (disease)|consumption]] at the age of 26. He was a follower of [[James Dalrymple, 1st Viscount of Stair|James Dalrymple]]. In later life he was well known as an [[evangelical Christian]].<ref>[[Andrew Pyle (philosopher)|Andrew Pyle]] (editor), ''Dictionary of Seventeenth Century British Philosophers'' (2000), article pp. 90-95.</ref>\n\n==Impact of the Commonwealth==\nHugh Binning was born two years after [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] ascended to the thrones of England, Ireland, and Scotland.  At the time, each was an independent country sharing the same monarch. The [[Acts of Union 1707]] integrated Scotland and England to form the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]; the [[Acts of Union 1800]] integrated Ireland to form [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]].\n\nThe period was dominated by both political and religious strife between the three independent countries. The religious dispute centered on whether religion was to be dictated by the monarch or was to be the choice of the people; whether people have a direct relationship with God or they needed to use an intermediary. The civil disputes centered on the extent of the king's power, a question of the [[Divine right of kings]]; specifically whether the King has right to raise taxes and armed forces without the [[Consent of the governed]].  These wars ultimately changed the relationship between king and subjects.\n\nIn 1638 the [[General Assembly of the Church of Scotland]] voted to remove bishops and the [[Book of Common Prayer]] that had been introduced by Charles I to impose the Anglican model on the Presbyterian Church of Scotland.  Public riots occurred.  The result was the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]], an interrelated series of conflicts that took place in the three countries sharing the same monarch. The first of the conflicts was in 1639, the First of the [[Bishops' Wars]], a single border skirmish between England and Scotland; also known as ''the war the armys did not wanted to fight.''\n\nTo maintain his English power base Charles I made secret alliances with Catholic Ireland and Presbyterian Scotland to invade Anglican England, promising that each country could establish their own separate state religion. Once these secret entreaties became known to the English [[Long Parliament]], the [[Independent (religion)|Congregationalist faction]] (of which [[Oliver Cromwell]] was a primary spokesman) took matters into their own hands and Parliament established an army separate from the King.  Then, Charles I was executed in January 1649, which led to the rule of [[Cromwell]] and the establishment of the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]].  The conflicts concluded with [[The English Restoration]] of the monarchy with the return of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], in 1660.\n\nThe [[Act of Classes]] was passed by the Parliament of Scotland on 23 January 1649; the act banned [[Royalists]] (people supporting the monarchy) from holding political or military office.  In exile, Charles II signed the [[Treaty of Breda (1650)]] with the Scottish Parliament; among other things, the treaty established Presbyterianism as the national religion.  Charles was crowned King of Scots at [[Scone, Scotland|Scone]] in January 1651.  By September 1651 Scotland was annexed by England, its legislative institutions abolished, Presbyterianism dis-established, and Charles was forced into exile in France.\n\nThe Scottish Parliament rescinded the Act of Classes in 1651, which produced a split within Scottish Society.  The sides of the conflict were called the Resolutioners (who supported the rescission of the act \u2013 supported the monarchy and the Scottish [[House of Stewart]]) and the Protesters (who supported Cromwell and the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]]); Binning sided with the Protestors.<ref>\n{{cite web\n|url=http://biblehub.com/library/howie/biographia_scoticana_scots_worthies/the_life_of_mr_hugh.htm |title=http://biblehub.com/library/howie/biographia_scoticana_scots_worthies/the_life_of_mr_hugh.htm |publisher=Bible Hub}}</ref>\n\nWhen Cromwell sent troops to Scotland, he was also attempting to dis-establish [[Presbyterian]]ism and the [[Church of Scotland]], Binning spoke against Cromwell's act.  On Saturday 19 April 1651, Cromwell entered Glasgow and the next day he heard a sermon by three ministers who condemned Cromwell for invading Scotland.  That evening, Cromwell summoned those ministers and others, to a debate on the issue.  At the debate, Rev Hugh Binning is said to have out-debated Cromwell's ministers so completely that he silenced Cromwell's ministers.<ref>\n{{cite web\n|url=http://christianbookshelf.org/howie/biographia_scoticana_scots_worthies/the_life_of_mr_hugh.htm\n|title= The Life of Mr. Hugh Binning. \n|publisher=Biographia Scoticana (Scots Worthies)\n|last=Howie\n|first=John\n|accessdate=11 January 2013\n}}\n</ref>\n\n==Politics==\nHugh Binning political views were based on his theology.  Binning was a [[Covenanter]], a movement that began in Scotland at [[Greyfriars Kirkyard]] in 1638 with the National Covenant and continued with the 1643 [[Solemn League and Covenant]] \u2013 in effect a treaty between the English [[Long Parliament]] and Scotland for the preservation of the reformed religion in exchange for troops to confront the threat of Irish Catholic troops joining the [[Royalist]] army.  Binning could also be described as a Protestor; both political positions were taken because of their religious implications.  However, he saw the evils of the politics of his day was not a \u201cfomenter of factions\u201d writing \u201cA Treatise of Christian Love\u201d as a response.<ref name=\"worthies\">{{cite book\n|title=Lives of the Scottish Covenanters; a Brief Historical Account of the most Eminent Noblemen, Gentlemen, Ministers, and Others\u2026 from the beginning of the 16th Century to the year 1688. \n|origyear=1775\n|year=1863\n|editors=A Clergyman of the Church of Scotland\n|publisher=W.

Binning was a [[Calvinist]] and follower of [[John Knox]].  As a profession, Binning was trained as a Philosopher, and he believed that [[philosophy]] was the servant of [[theology]].  He thought that both Philosophy and Theology should be taught in parallel. Binning's writing, which are primarily a collection of his sermons, \u201cforms an important bridge between the 17th century, when philosophy in Scotland was heavily dominated by Calvinism, and the 18th century when figures such as [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]] re-asserted a greater degree of independence between the two and allied philosophy with the developing human sciences.\u201d\n<ref>\n{{cite web\n|title= Hugh Binning 1627-1653 - The International Society for Scottish Philosophy\n|url=http://www.scottishphilosophy.org/hughbinning.html \n|accessdate=11 January 2013\n}}\n</ref>\n\nReligiously, Hugh Binning was, what we would call today, an [[Evangelical]] [[Calvinist]].  He spoke on the primacy of God's love as the ground of salvation: \n:\u2026 our salvation is not the business of Christ alone, but the whole Godhead is interested in it deeply, so deeply that you cannot say who loves it most, or who likes it most.  The Father is the very fountain of it, his love is the spring of all.<ref>{{cite book\n|title=\"Of The Unity Of The Godhead And The Trinity Of Persons, Lecture  XIII\" The Works of the Rev.

If a thing may be subject to diverse acceptations, it can put the best construction on it. It is so benign and good in its own nature that it is not inclinable to suspect others. It desires to condemn no man, but would gladly, as far as reason and conscience will permit, absolve every man. It is so far from desire of revenge, that it is not provoked or troubled with an injury. For that were nothing else but to wrong itself because others have wronged it already, and it is so far from wronging others, that it will not willingly so much as think evil of them. Yet if need require, charity can execute justice, and inflict chastisement, not out of desire of another\u2019s misery, but out of love and compassion to mankind. Charitas non punit quia peccatum est, sed ne peccaretur, ''it looks more to prevention of future sin, than to revenge of a bypast fault'', and can do all without any discomposure of spirit, as a physician cuts a vein without anger.

Matthew M'Kell,<ref name=\"kindle-works7\">Binning, Hugh; Kindle Locations 20469-20474</ref>\n<ref group=\"note\">\"Matthew M\u2019Kell, was a minister in the parish of [[Bothwell]], near Glasgow.  \u201cAfter having been, on different occasions brought before the Privy council, and imprisoned, he was, on the 8th of January, 1674, upon his refusing to engage not to preach, ordered to confine himself to the parish of [[Carluke]], and security was required from him that he would appear before the Council at their summons\u2026. He died at Edinburgh, in March 1681\u201d.

Spelling of names was not as precise in those days, e.g. when describing Hugh Binning in the same document, there are variations of the spelling of the Binning name.  \nHugh M\u2019Kell was arrested for being concerned in the insurrection at [[Pentland Rising]]. Hugh M'Keil was imprisoned and tortured (his foot was mangled to the point of compound fractures using the [[Boot (torture)|boot]]). In the end, M'Kell was executed in Edinburgh on 22 December 1666 because he would not sign the [[Test Act]] \u2013 because his preaching would not conform to the Anglican tradition. \"The address of young M\u2019Kail on the scaffold concluded with these sublime expressions\u2014\u201cFarewell, father and mother, friends and relations. Farewell the world, and all delights. Farewell meat and drink. Farewell sun, moon and stars. Welcome God and Father! Welcome sweet Lord Jesus the Mediator of the new covenant! Welcome blessed Spirit of grace, and God of all consolation! Welcome glory! Welcome eternal life! Welcome death!\u201d \nWe are told by Kirkton that \u201cwhen Mr. M\u2019Kail died, there was such a lamentation as was never known in Scotland before, not one dry cheek upon all the street or in all the numberless windows in the market place\u201d \nIt was discovered afterwards, that [[Alexander Burnet]], then the archbishop of Glasgow, had in his possession at the time, a letter from the king, forbidding any more blood to be shed.

After a national search for a replacement on the faculty, three men were selected to compete for the position.  Hugh was one of those selected, but was at a disadvantage because of his extreme youth and because he was not of noble birth. However, he had strong support from the existing faculty, who suggested that the candidates speak extemporaneously on any topic of the candidate's choice.  After hearing Hugh speak, the other candidates withdrew, making Hugh a regent and professor of philosophy, while he was still 18 years old.<ref name=\"worthies2\">Scottish Worthies p 203</ref>{{rp|203}}\n\nOn 7 February 1648 (at the age of 21) Hugh was appointed an Advocate before the Court of Sessions (an attorney).  In the same year he married Barbara Simpson (sometimes called Mary), daughter of Rev. James Simpson a minister in Ireland.  Their son, John, was born in 1650.<ref name=\"Works of Hugh Binning\"/>\n\nHugh died around September 1653 and was buried in the churchyard of Govan, where [[Patrick Gillespie]], then principal of the University of Glasgow, ordered a monument inscribed in Latin, roughly translated: \n:Here lies Mr. Hugh Binning, a man distinguished for his piety and eloquence, learned in philology, philosophy, and theology, a Prelate, faithful to the Gospel, and finally an excellent preacher.  In the middle of a series of events, he was taken at the age of 26, in the year of our Lord 1653. Alive, he changed the society of his own land because he walked with God.

Together they had a daughter, Jean who married Daniel MacKenzie, who was on the winning side of the [[Battle of Bothwell Bridge]] serving as an ensign under Lieutenant-Colonel William Ramsay (who became the third [[Earl of Dalhousie]]), in the Earl of Mar's Regiment of Foot.<ref name=\"jardine\"/>\n\nHugh's son, John Binning, married Hanna Keir, who was born in Ireland.  The Binning's were [[Covenanters]], a resistance movement that objected to the return of Charles II (who was received into the Catholic Church on his deathbed).  They were on the losing side in the 1679 [[Battle of Bothwell Bridge]]. Most of the rebels who were not executed were exiled to the Americas; about 30 Covenanters were exiled to the Carolinas on the Carolina Merchant in 1684. After the battle, John and Hanna were separated.  \n<ref>\n{{cite web\n|title=The Departed: The Covenanters Banished on the Carolina Merchant in 1684\n|first=Mark\n|last=Jardine\n|url=http://drmarkjardine.wordpress.com/2012/07/25/the-departed-the-covenanters-banished-on-the-carolina-merchant-in-1684\n|accessdate=17 January 2013\n}}\n</ref>\n\nIn the aftermath of the battle at Bothwell Bridge, Hugh's widow (now Barbara Gordon) tried to reclaim the family estate at Dalvennan by saying that John and his wife owed his step father a considerable some of money.  The legal action was successful and Dalvennan became the possession of John's half sister Jean, and her husband Daniel MacKenzie.<ref name=\"jardine\"/> In addition, Jean came into possession Hanna Keir's property in Ireland.\n\nBy 1683, Jean was widowed.  John Binning was branded a traitor, was sentenced to death and forfeited his property to the Crown.  John's wife (Hanna Keir) was branded as a traitor and forfeited her property in Ireland.  In 1685 Jean \"donated\" the Binning family's home at Dalvennan and other properties, along with the Keir properties to Roderick MacKenzie, who was a Scottish advocate of [[James II of England|James II (James VII of Scotland)]], and the [[baillie]] of [[Carrick, Scotland|Carrick]]. According to an act of the Scottish Parliament, Roderick MacKenzie was also very effective in \u201csuppressing the rebellious, fanatical party in the western and other shires of this realm, and putting the laws to vigorous execution against them\u201d<ref>\n{{cite web\n|title= Ratification in favour of Mr Roderick MacKenzie of Dalvennan\n|publisher=Parliamentary Register, Charters: Ratifications\n|date=16 June 1685\n|url= http://www.rps.ac.uk/trans/1685/4/125\n|accessdate=19 January 2013\n}}\n</ref>\n\nSince Bothwell Bridge, Hanna had been hiding from the authorities.  In 1685 Hanna was in Edinburgh where she was found during a sweep for subversives and imprisoned in the [[Tolbooth]] of Edinburgh, a combination city hall and prison. Those arrested with Hanna were exiled to North America, however she developed [[Dysentery]] and remained behind.  By 1687, near death, Hanna petitioned the [[Privy Council of Scotland]] for her release; she was exiled to her family in Ireland, where she died around 1692.<ref name=\"jardine\"/>\n \nIn 1690 the Scottish Parliament rescinded John's fines and forfeiture, but he was not able to recover his family's estates, the courts suggesting that John had relinquished his claim to Dalvennan in exchange for forgiveness of debt, rather than forfeiture.<ref>\n{{cite web\n|title= Remit to the committee for fines and forfeitures in favour of Mr Roderick MacKenzie, advocate, anent the gift of forfeiture of the lands of Dalvennan\n|publisher=Parliamentary Register, Prodedure: remit to committee\n|date=22 July 1690\n|accessdate=19 January 2013\n|url=http://www.rps.ac.uk/trans/1690/4/180\n}}\n</ref>\n\nThere is little documentation about John after his wife's death. John received a small income from royalties on his father Hugh's works after parliament extended copyrights on Hugh's writings to him.  However, the income was not significant and John made several petitions to the Scottish parliament for money, the last occurring in 1717.  It is thought that John died in [[Somerset]] county, in southwestern England. \n<ref>\n{{cite web\n|title= The Scottish Nation - Binning and Byres\n|url=http://www.electricscotland.com/history/nation/binning.htm\n|accessdate=11 January 2013\n}}\n</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=\"note\"}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{Eminent Scotsmen|Binning, Hugh|1|215-16}}\n* {{cite DNB|wstitle=Binning, Hugh}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Gutenberg author | id=Binning,+Hugh | name=Hugh Binning}}\n* {{Internet Archive author |sname=Hugh Binning}}\n*{{prdl|146}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20061017045632/http://www.covenanter.org/HBinning/hughbinning.htm Biographical Sketch from the home page of the Reformed Presbyterian Church (Covenanted)]\n* [http://scotlandskillingtimes.com/wp/?cat=1181 John Binning of Dalvennan, The Forfeited: The Carrick Lairds at the Battle of Bothwell Bridge]\n* [http://www.bing.com/maps/default.aspx?encType=1&where1=Dalvennan%2c+Scotland%2c+United+Kingdom&cp=55.3630218505859~-4.54986000061035&qpvt=Dalvennan%2c+scotland&FORM=MIRE Map of Dalvennan, South Ayrshire, Scotland]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Binning, Hugh}}\n[[Category:1627 births]]\n[[Category:1653 deaths]]\n[[Category:Scottish Calvinist and Reformed theologians]]\n[[Category:Academics of the University of Glasgow]]\n[[Category:Scottish philosophers]]\n[[Category:Alumni of the University of Glasgow]]\n[[Category:People from Ayr]]\n[[Category:17th-century Calvinist and Reformed theologians]]\n[[Category:17th-century Scottish people]]\n[[Category:17th-century philosophers]]\n[[Category:17th-century deaths from tuberculosis]]", "sha1": "qoeoocwmfoqlyxwn24s4jaav4i7k8ya"}}, {"title": "Henry Home, Lord Kames", "ns": "0", "id": "14064", "revision": {"id": "830178488", "parentid": "824000710", "timestamp": "2018-03-13T06:53:28Z", "contributor": {"username": "InternetArchiveBot", "id": "27015025"}, "comment": "Rescuing 1 sources and tagging 0 as dead. #IABot (v1.6.5) ([[User:Artix Kreiger|Artix Kreiger]])", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2017}}\n{{Use British English|date=November 2017}}\n[[File:Henry Home, Lord Kames by David Martin.jpg|thumb|Henry Home, Lord Kames, by David Martin.]]\n[[File:Henry Home, Lord Kames; Hugo Arnot; James Burnett, Lord Monboddo by John Kay.jpg|thumb|200px|''Henry Home, Lord Kames; [[Hugo Arnot]]; [[James Burnett, Lord Monboddo]]'', by [[John Kay (caricaturist)|John Kay]].]]\n[[File:The Home-Drummond grave, Kincardine-in-Menteith.jpg|thumb|The Home-Drummond grave, Kincardine-in-Menteith]]\n'''Henry Home, Lord Kames''' (1696{{spaced ndash}}27 December 1782) was a Scottish [[advocate]], judge, philosopher, writer and [[Scottish Agricultural Revolution|agricultural improver]]. A central figure of the [[Scottish Enlightenment]], a founder member of the [[Philosophical Society of Edinburgh]], and active in the [[Select Society]], his [[prot\u00e9g\u00e9]]s included [[David Hume]], [[Adam Smith]], and [[James Boswell]].\n\n==Biography==\nBorn at [[Kames House]], between [[Eccles, Berwickshire|Eccles]] and Birgham, [[Berwickshire]], he was [[educated at home]] by a [[private tutor]]. He studied law at [[Edinburgh]], was called to the bar in 1724, and became an [[advocate]]. He soon acquired reputation by a number of publications on the civil and Scottish law, and was one of the leaders of the [[Scottish Enlightenment]]. In 1752, he was \"raised to the bench\", thus acquiring the title of '''Lord Kames'''.\n\nHome was on the panel of judges in the [[Joseph Knight (slave)|Joseph Knight]] case which ruled that there could be no slavery in [[Scotland]].\n\nHis address in 1775 is shown as New Street on the [[Canongate]].<ref>Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1775</ref>\n\nHe is buried in the Home-Drummond plot at Kincardine-in-Menteith just west of [[Blair Drummond]].\n\n==Writings==\nHome wrote much about the importance of property to society.  In his ''Essay Upon Several Subjects Concerning British Antiquities'', written just after the [[Jacobite rising of 1745]] he described how the [[politics of Scotland]] were not based on loyalty to Kings or Queens as Jacobites had said but on royal land grants given in return for loyalty.\n\nIn ''Historical Law Tracts'' and later in ''Sketches on the History of Man'' he described human history as having four distinct stages.  The first was as a [[hunter-gatherer]] where people avoided each other out of competition.  The second stage he described was a [[herder]] of domestic animals which required forming larger societies.  No laws were needed at these stages except those given by the head of the family or society.  [[Agriculture]] was the third stage requiring greater cooperation and new relationships to allow for trade or employment (or slavery).  He argued that 'the intimate union among a multitude of individuals, occasioned by agriculture' required a new set of rights and obligations in society.  This requires laws and law enforcers.  A fourth stage moves from villages and farms to [[civilization|seaports and market towns]] requiring yet more laws and complexity but also much to benefit from. Kames could see these stages within Scotland itself,<ref>''[[How the Scots Invented the Modern World]]'', by Arthur Hermann, {{ISBN|0-609-60635-2}}</ref> with the pastoral/agricultural highlands, the agricultural/industrial lowlands and the growing commercial (\"polite\") towns of Glasgow and Edinburgh.\n\nHome was a [[polygenist]], he believed God had created different races on earth in separate regions. In his book ''Sketches of the History of Man'', in 1774, Home claimed that the environment, climate, or state of society could not account for racial differences, so that the races must have come from distinct, separate stocks.<ref>John P. Jackson, Nadine M. Weidman Race, Racism, and science: social impact and interaction, Rutgers University Press, 2005, pp. 39\u201341</ref>\n\nThe above studies created the genre of the story of civilization and defined the fields of [[anthropology]] and [[sociology]] and therefore the modern study of history for two hundred years.\n\nIn the popular book ''Elements of Criticism'' (1762) Home interrogated the notion of fixed or arbitrary rules of literary composition, and endeavoured to establish a new theory based on the principles of human nature. The late eighteenth-century tradition of sentimental writing was associated with his notion that 'the genuine rules of criticism are all of them derived from the human heart.<ref>Vol. 1, p. 16.</ref> Prof Neil Rhodes has argued that Lord Kames played a significant role in the development of English as an academic discipline in the Scottish Universities.<ref>See 'From Rhetoric to Composition' in ''The Scottish Invention of English Literature'', ed. Robert Crawford, p. 28.</ref>\n\n==Social milieu==\nHe enjoyed intelligent conversation and cultivated a large number of intellectual associates, among them [[John Home]], [[David Hume]] and [[James Boswell]].[https://web.archive.org/web/20060109230637/http://www.jamesboswell.info/People/people.php?person=57].

The town became a naval base in 1657 and was heavily fortified,<ref>Trollope, C., \"The Defences of Harwich\", ''Fort'' ([[Fortress Study Group]]), 1982, ('''10'''), pp5-31</ref> with [[Harwich Redoubt]], [[Beacon Hill Battery]], and [[Bath Side Battery]].\n\nHarwich is the likely launch point of the ''[[Mayflower]]'' which carried English [[Puritans]] to [[North America]], and is the presumed birthplace of ''Mayflower'' captain [[Christopher Jones (Mayflower captain)|Christopher Jones]].  \n\nHarwich today is contiguous with [[Dovercourt]] and the two, along with [[Parkeston, Essex|Parkeston]], are often referred to collectively as Harwich.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Harwich Harbour 1804.png|upright|thumb|left|An 1804 chart of Harwich from a survey by Graeme Spence]]\nThe town's name means \"military settlement\", from Old English ''here-wic''.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=PzIer-wYbnQC&pg=PA152&lpg=PA152&dq=harwich+military+settlement&source=bl&ots=OF_uuFNMyw&sig=fLhEb4KSJS4YXP_bXFlipo0q9Ig&hl=en&ei=4Kt7S_X7C4PlkAWEi638BA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9&ved=0CCgQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=harwich%20military%20settlement&f=false Adrian Room, ''Placenames of the World'' (2003), \"Harwich\"].

However, unfavourable winds forced his fleet to sail into the [[English Channel]] instead and eventually land at [[Torbay]]. Due to the involvement of the [[Frederick Schomberg, 1st Duke of Schomberg|Schomberg]] family in the invasion, Charles Louis Schomberg was made Marquess of Harwich.<ref>{{cite web|title=Charles Louis Schomberg, Marquess of Harwich |work=The Peerage|url=http://thepeerage.com/p1375.htm#i13741 |publisher=Lundy Consulting Ltd |accessdate=27 March 2012 |date=10 May 2003 }}</ref>\n\nWriter [[Daniel Defoe]] devotes a few pages to the town in ''[[A tour thro' the Whole Island of Great Britain]]''.

The locals also claimed that \"the same spring is said to turn wood into iron\", but Defoe put this down to the presence of \"[[ferrous sulphate|copperas]]\" in the water. Regarding the atmosphere of the town, he states: \"Harwich is a town of hurry and business, not much of gaiety and pleasure; yet the inhabitants seem warm in their nests and some of them are very wealthy\".<ref name=Defoe/>\n\nHarwich played an important part in the Napoleonic and more especially the two world wars. Of particular note:\n\n1793-1815--Post Office Station for communication with Europe, one of embarkation and evacuation bases for expeditions to Holland in 1799, 1809 and 1813/14; base for capturing enemy privateers. The dockyard built many ships for the Navy, including [[HMS Conqueror (1801)|HMS ''Conqueror'']] which captured the French [[Pierre-Charles Villeneuve|Admiral Villeneuve]] at the [[Battle of Trafalgar]]. The Redoubt and the now-demolished Ordnance Building date from that era.\n\n1914-18--base for the [[Royal Navy]]'s [[Harwich Force]] light cruisers and destroyers under Commodore Tyrwhitt, and for British submarines. In November 1918 the German [[U-Boat]] fleet surrendered to the Royal Navy in the harbour.\n\n1939-1945--one of main East Coast minesweeping and destroyer bases, at one period base for British and French submarines; assembled fleets for Dutch and [[Dunkirk evacuation]]s and follow-up to [[D-Day]]; unusually a target in 1940 for Italian bombers. \n\n===Royal Naval Dockyard===\n{{main|Harwich Dockyard}}\nHarwich Dockyard was established as a [[Royal Navy Dockyard]] in 1652. It ceased to operate as a Royal Dockyard in 1713 (though a Royal Navy presence was maintained until 1829). During the various wars with France and Holland, through to 1815, the dockyard was responsible for both building and repairing numerous warships. [[HMS Conqueror (1801)|HMS ''Conqueror'']], a 74-gun ship completed in 1801, captured the French admiral Villeneuve at Trafalgar.\nThe yard was then a semi-private concern, with the actual shipbuilding contracted to Joseph Graham, who was sometimes mayor of the town.<ref>{{cite book|last=Foynes|first=Julian|title=East Anglia Against the Tricolor|publisher= Poppyland Press|date=2016}}</ref>\nDuring [[World War II]] parts of Harwich were again requisitioned for naval use and ships were based at [[HMS Badger (shore establishment)|HMS ''Badger'']]; ''Badger'' was decommissioned in 1946, but the [[Royal Naval Auxiliary Service]] maintained a headquarters on the site until 1992.<ref>{{cite web|title=www.harwichanddovercourt.co.uk|url=http://www.harwichanddovercourt.co.uk/the-war-years/}}</ref>\n\n==Port==\n[[File:HarwichDocks.jpg|thumbnail|left|Harwich 'Navyard' and Harwich seen from the river]]\nThe Royal Navy no longer has a presence in Harwich but [[Harwich International Port]] at nearby [[Parkeston, Essex|Parkeston]] continues to offer regular [[ferry]] services to the [[Hook of Holland]] (Hoek van Holland) in the [[Netherlands]].

Both were coal-fired.\n\nIn 1818 these were replaced by stone structures, designed by John Rennie Senior, which can still be seen today (they no longer function as lighthouses: one houses the town's maritime museum, the other is (in 2015) also being converted into a museum).<ref>{{cite web|title=Local newspaper report|url=http://www.gazette-news.co.uk/news/local/clacton/11688026.High_hopes_for_High_Lighthouse/}}</ref> They were owned by General Rebow of [[Wivenhoe Park]], who was able to charge 1d per ton on all cargo entering the port, for upkeep of the lights.

Landscape - WGA1082.jpg|thumb|Winter Scene on a Canal]]\n'''Hendrick Avercamp''' (January 27, 1585 (bapt.) &ndash; May 15, 1634 (buried)) was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] painter. Avercamp was born in [[Amsterdam]], where he studied with the Danish-born portrait painter [[Pieter Isaacks]] (1569\u20131625), and perhaps also with [[David Vinckboons]]. In 1608 he moved from Amsterdam to [[Kampen, Overijssel|Kampen]] in the province of [[Overijssel]]. Avercamp was deaf and [[Muteness|mute]] and was known as \"de Stomme van Kampen\" (the mute of Kampen).\n\nAs one of the first landscape painters of the 17th-century Dutch school, he specialized in painting the Netherlands in winter. Avercamp's paintings are colorful and lively, with carefully crafted images of the people in the landscape.  Many of Avercamp's paintings feature people ice skating on frozen lakes.\n\nAvercamp's work enjoyed great popularity and he sold his drawings, many of which were tinted with water-color, as finished pictures to be pasted into the albums of collectors. The [[Royal Collection]] has an outstanding collection of his works.\n\nAvercamp died in Kampen and was interred there in the [[Bovenkerk, Kampen|Sint Nicolaaskerk]].\n\n==Artwork==\nAvercamp probably painted in his studio on the basis of sketches he had made in the winter.\nAvercamp is famous even abroad for his winter landscapes. The passion for painting skating characters probably came from his childhood: he was practicing this hobby with his parents. The last quarter of the 16th century, during which Avercamp was born, was one of the coldest periods of the [[Little Ice Age]].\n\nThe Flemish painting tradition is mainly expressed in Avercamp's early work. This is consistent with the landscapes of [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]]. Avercamp painted landscapes with a high horizon and many figures who are working on something. The paintings are narrative, with many anecdotes. For instance, naughty details are included in the painting \"Winter landscape with skaters\": a couple making love, buttocks and a peeing male. [[File:Winter landscape with skaters, by Hendrick Avercamp.jpg|thumb|[[Winter Landscape with Skaters]]]]\n\nLater in his life drawing the atmosphere was also important in his work. The horizon also gradually dropped down under more and more air.\n\nAvercamp used the painting technique of [[aerial perspective]]. The depth is suggested by change of color in the distance. To the front objects are painted, such as trees or a boat. This technique strengthens the impression of depth in the painting.\n\nAvercamp has also painted cattle and seascapes.\n\nSometimes Avercamp used paper frames, which were a cheap alternative to oil paintings. He first drew with pen and ink. This work was then covered with finishing paint. The contours of the drawing remained. Even with this technique Avercamp could show the pale wintry colors and nuances of the ice .\n\nAvercamp produced about a hundred paintings. The bulk of his artwork can be seen in the [[Rijksmuseum]] in Amsterdam, the [[Mauritshuis]] in The Hague and abroad. \nFrom November 20, 2009 to February 15, 2010 the Rijksmuseum presented an exhibition of his work entitled \"Little Ice Age\".\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Hendrick Avercamp}}\n*[http://www.ibiblio.org/wm/paint/auth/avercamp/ Avercamp at the WebMuseum]\n*[http://www.museumsyndicate.com/artist.php?artist=187 Avercamp at Museum Syndicate]\n*[https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/explore-the-collection/overview/hendrick-avercamp Avercamp at Rijksmuseum Amsterdam]\n*[http://www.owlstand.com/exhibition/room/33bef103-fc18-4d5b-a7b5-9b314973ed41 master pieces from Hendrick Avercamp - Online Exhibition at Owlstand]\n*{{Art UK bio}} \n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Avercamp, Hendrick}}\n[[Category:1585 births]]\n[[Category:1634 deaths]]\n[[Category:Dutch Golden Age painters]]\n[[Category:Dutch male painters]]\n[[Category:Artists from Amsterdam]]\n[[Category:People from Kampen, Overijssel]]\n[[Category:Mute people]]", "sha1": "oyfkkdbnfiiiwkude9sn84lux9zm70t"}}, {"title": "Hans Baldung", "ns": "0", "id": "14068", "revision": {"id": "854179164", "parentid": "854123398", "timestamp": "2018-08-09T13:56:56Z", "contributor": {"username": "Nerdgoonrant", "id": "18519073"}, "minor": "", "comment": "/* Witchcraft and religious imagery */  added links, removed dead-end tag", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2012}}\n{{Infobox artist\n| bgcolour      = #EEDD73\n| name          = Hans Baldung \n| image         = Hans Baldung, Self-Portrait.jpg\n| imagesize     = 250\n| caption       = Self-Portrait\n|birth_name=Hans Baldung Grien\n| birth_date    =c. 1484\n| birth_place   = Free Imperial City of [[Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd]]\n| death_date    = September 1545 (aged c. 61)\n| death_place   = Free Imperial City of [[Strasbourg]]\n| nationality   =\n| field         = [[Printmaking]], painting\n| training      =\n| patrons       =\n| awards        =\n}}\n[[File:Hans Baldung Grien - Portrait of a Man - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Portrait of a Man]]\n\n'''Hans Baldung Grien''' or '''Gr\u00fcn'''{{sfn|Baynes|Smith|1880|p=224}} ({{nowrap|c. 1484 \u2013}} September 1545) was a German artist in painting and [[printmaking]] who was considered the most gifted student of [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]]. Throughout his lifetime, Baldung developed a distinctive style, full of color, expression and imagination. His talents were varied, and he produced a great and extensive variety of work including portraits, woodcuts, altarpieces, drawings, tapestries, allegories and mythological motifs.\n\n==Early life==\n\nHans Baldung was born in [[Swabia]], Germany around the year 1484 to a family of intellectuals, academics and professionals. His father was a lawyer and his uncle was a doctor, and many other of his family members maintained professional degrees. In fact, Baldung was the first male in his family not to attend university, but was one of the first German artists to come from an academic family.<ref>Brady, Thomas A. \"The Social Place of a German Renaissance Artist: Hans Baldung Grien (1484/5-1545) at Strausbourg\", ''[[Central European History]]'', vol. 8, no. 4, 1975, pp. 303-304., [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4545752 JSTOR]</ref> His earliest training as an artist began around 1500 in the Upper Rhineland by an artist from Strasbourg.\n\n==Life as a student of D\u00fcrer==\n[[File:Hans Baldung Grien - Die Kreuzigung Christi - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Crucifixion]]\n\nBeginning in 1503, Baldung was an apprentice for the most well renowned German artist of the day: Albrecht D\u00fcrer. Here, he may have been given his nickname \u201cGrien.\u201d This name is thought to have come foremost from a preference to the color green:  he seems to have worn green clothing. He probably also got this nickname to distinguish him from at least two other Hanses in D\u00fcrer's shop, Hans Sch\u00e4ufelein and Hans Suess von Kulmbach. He later included the name \"Grien\" in his monogram, and it has also been suggested that the name came from, or consciously echoed, \"grienhals\", a German word for witch\u2014one of his signature themes.  Hans quickly picked up D\u00fcrer's influence and style, and they became good friends:  Baldung managed D\u00fcrer's workshop during the latter's second sojourn in Venice. In his later trip to the Netherlands in 1521 D\u00fcrer's diary shows that he took with him and sold prints by Baldung. On D\u00fcrer's death Baldung was sent a lock of his hair, which suggests a close friendship. Near the end of his apprenticeship, Grien oversaw the production of stained glass, woodcuts and engravings, and therefore developed an affinity for them.\n\n==Strasbourg==\n\nIn 1509, when Baldung\u2019s apprenticeship was complete, he moved back to Strasbourg and became a [[Citizenship#Middle Ages|citizen there]]. He became a celebrity of the town, and received many important [[commissioner|commissions]].  The following year he married Margarethe Herlin, a local merchant's daughter,<ref>Brady, Thomas A. \"The Social Place of a German Renaissance Artist: Hans Baldung Grien (1484/5-1545) at Strausbourg\", ''[[Central European History]]'', vol. 8, no. 4, 1975, pp. 305, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4545752 JSTOR]</ref> joined the [[guild]] \"zur Steltz\", opened a workshop, and began signing his works with the HGB [[monogram]] that he used for the rest of his career. His style also became much more deliberately individual\u2014a tendency some [[art historians]] have termed \"[[mannerist]].\"\n\n==Witchcraft and religious imagery==\n[[File:Hans Baldung Grien - The Trinity and Mystic Piet\u00e0 - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[The Trinity and Mystic Piet\u00e0]]'']] \n\nIn addition to traditional religious subjects, Baldung was concerned during these years with the profane theme of the imminence of death and with scenes of sorcery and [[witchcraft]]. He helped introduce supernatural and [[Erotic art|erotic]] themes into German art, although these were already amply present in his master's work. Most famously, he depicted witches, also a local interest: Strasbourg's humanists studied witchcraft and its bishop was charged with finding and prosecuting witches. His most characteristic paintings are small in scale; a series of puzzling, often erotic allegories and mythological works. The number of Hans Baldung's religious works diminished with the [[Protestant Reformation]], which generally repudiated church art as either wasteful or idolatrous. But earlier, around the same time that he produced Adam and Eve, the artist became interested in themes related to death, the supernatural, witchcraft, sorcery, and the relation between the sexes.  Baldung\u2019s fascination with witchcraft lasted to the end of his career.\n\nHans Baldung Grien's work depicting witches was produced in the first half of the 16th century, before [[witch hunting]] became a widespread cultural phenomenon in Europe. Thus Baldung's work did not represent cultural beliefs at the time of creation but largely individual choices.<ref name=\":0\">Sullivan, Margaret A. \u201cThe Witches of D\u00fcrer and Hans Baldung Grien.\u201d Renaissance Quarterly, vol. 53, no. 2, 2000, pp. 333\u2013401., www.jstor.org/stable/2901872.</ref> Furthermore, Baldung never worked directly with any Reformation leaders to spread religious ideals through his artwork, although living in fervently religious Strasbourg,<ref>Rowlands, John. \"Washington and Yale. Hans Baldung Grien\", ''[[The Burlington Magazine]]'', vol. 123, no. 937, 1981, pp. 263\u2013263., [www.jstor.org/stable/880364 JSTOR]</ref> although he was a supporter of the movement, working on the high altar in the city of M\u00fcnster, Germany.<ref>Nenonen, Marko, and Raisa Maria Toivo, eds. ''Writing witch-hunt histories: challenging the paradigm''. Brill, 2013.</ref>\n\nBaldung was the first artist to heavily incorporate witches and witchcraft into his artwork (his mentor Albrecht D\u00fcrer had sporadically included them but not as prominently as Baldung would). During his lifetime there were minimal witch trials, as well as a lack of witch manuals or witch hunts, therefore, some believe Baldung's depictions of witchcraft to be based on folklore rather than the cultural beliefs of his time. By contrast, throughout the early sixteenth century, [[humanism]] became very popular, and within this movement, Latin literature was valorized, particularly poetry and satire. Baldung partook in this culture, producing not only many works depicting Strasbourg humanists and scenes from ancient art and literature, but what some have described as his satirical take on his depiction of witches. Gert von der Osten comments on this aspect of \"Baldung [treating] his witches humorously, an attitude that reflects the dominant viewpoint of the humanists in Strasbourg at this time who viewed witchcraft as 'lustig,' a matter that was more amusing than serious\".<ref name=\":0\" /> Furthermore, his art simultaneously represents ideals presented in ancient Greek and Roman poetry, such as the pre-16th century notion that witches could control the weather, which Baldung is believed to have alluded to in his 1523 oil painting \"Weather Witches\", which showcases two attractive and naked witches in front of a stormy sky.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nBaldung also regularly incorporated scenes of witches flying in his art, a characteristic that had been contested centuries before his artwork came into being. Flying was inherently attributed to witches by those who believed in the myth of the Sabbath (without their ability to fly, the myth fragmented), such as Baldung, which he depicted in works like \"Witches Preparing for the Sabbath Flight\" (1514).<ref>Hults, Linda C. \"Baldung and the Witches of Freiburg: The Evidence of Images\", ''The Journal of Interdisciplinary History'', vol. 18, no. 2, 1987, pp. 249\u2013276., [www.jstor.org/stable/204283 JSTOR]</ref>\n\n==Work==\n\n===Painting===\n[[File:Hans Baldung Grien - Bildnis einer Dame (Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza).jpg|thumb|Throughout his life, Baldung painted numerous portraits, known for their sharp characterizations.]]\n\nThroughout his life, Baldung painted numerous portraits, known for their sharp characterizations. While D\u00fcrer rigorously details his models, Baldung's style differs by focusing more on the personality of the represented character, an abstract conception of the model's state of mind. Baldung settled eventually in Strasbourg and then to Freiburg im Breisgau, where he executed what is held to be his masterpiece. Here in painted an eleven-panel altarpiece for the Freiburg Cathedral, still intact today, depicting scenes from the life of the Virgin, including, The Annunciation, The Visitation, The Nativity, The Flight into Egypt, The Crucifixion, Four Saints and The Donators. These depictions were a large part of the artist\u2019s greater body of work containing several renowned pieces of the Virgin.{{sfn|Cleef|1907}}\n\nThe earliest pictures assigned to him by some are altar-pieces with the monogram '''H. B.''' interlaced, and the date of 1496, in the monastery chapel of Lichtenthal near [[Baden-Baden]]. Another early work is a portrait of the [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|emperor Maximilian]], drawn in 1501 on a leaf of a sketch-book now in the print-room at [[Karlsruhe]]. \"The Martyrdom of St Sebastian and the Epiphany\" (now Berlin, 1507), were painted for the market-church of [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]] in Saxony.{{sfn|Ashby|1911|p=640}}\n\nBaldung's [[old master print|prints]], though D\u00fcreresque, are very individual in style, and often in subject. They show little direct Italian influence. His paintings are less important than his prints. He worked mainly in [[woodcut]], although he made six [[engraving]]s, one very fine. He joined in the fashion for [[chiaroscuro woodcut]]s, adding a tone block to a woodcut of 1510.  Most of his hundreds of woodcuts were commissioned for books, as was usual at the time; his \"single-leaf\" woodcuts (i.e. prints not for book illustration) are fewer than 100, though no two catalogues agree as to the exact number.\n\nUnconventional as a draughtsman, his treatment of human form is often exaggerated and eccentric (hence his linkage, in the art historical literature, with European [[Mannerism]]), whilst his ornamental style\u2014profuse, eclectic, and akin to the self-consciously \"German\" strain of contemporary [[Tilia|limewood]] sculptors\u2014is equally distinctive.  Though Baldung has been commonly called the [[Correggio]] of the north, his compositions are a curious medley of glaring and heterogeneous colours, in which pure black is contrasted with pale yellow, dirty grey, impure red and glowing green. Flesh is a mere glaze under which the features are indicated by lines.{{sfn|Ashby|1911|p=640}}\n\nHis works are notable for their individualistic departure from the Renaissance composure of his model, D\u00fcrer, for the wild and fantastic strength that some of them display, and for their remarkable themes.  In the field of painting, his ''[[Eve, the Serpent and Death]]'' ([[National Gallery of Canada]]) shows his strengths well.  There is special force in the \"Death and the Maiden\" panel of 1517 (Basel), in the \"Weather Witches\" (Frankfurt), in the monumental panels of \"Adam\" and \"Eve\" (Madrid), and in his many powerful portraits. Baldung's most sustained effort is the altarpiece of Freiburg, where the Coronation of the Virgin, and the Twelve Apostles, the Annunciation, Visitation, Nativity and Flight into Egypt, and the Crucifixion, with [[donor portrait|portraits of donors]], are executed with some of that fanciful power that [[Martin Schongauer]] bequeathed to the [[Swabian school]].{{sfn|Ashby|1911|p=640}}\n\nAs a portrait painter he is well known. He drew [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], as well as Maximilian; and his bust of Margrave Philip in the Munich Gallery tells us that he was connected with the reigning family of Baden as early as 1514. At a later period he had sittings with Margrave Christopher of Baden, Ottilia his wife, and all their children, and the picture containing these portraits is still in the gallery at Karlsruhe. Like D\u00fcrer and [[Lucas Cranach the Elder|Cranach]], Baldung supported the [[Protestant Reformation]]. He was present at the [[diet of Augsburg]] in 1518, and one of his [[woodcut]]s represents [[Martin Luther|Luther]] in quasi-saintly guise, under the protection of (or being inspired by) the Holy Spirit, which hovers over him in the shape of a dove.{{sfn|Ashby|1911|p=640}}\n\n==Selected works==\n[[File:Hans Baldung - Mater Dolorosa (detail) - WGA01206.jpg|thumb|Hans Baldung - Mater Dolorosa (detail)]]\n\n*Two altar wings (Charles the Great, St. George), Augsburg, State Gallery.\n*The birth Christ, Basel, Kunstmuseum Basel, 1510\n*The crucifixion of Christ, Basel, Kunstmuseum Basel,  1512\n*Death and the Maiden, Basel, Kunstmuseum Basel, 1517\n*The crucifixion of Christ, Berlin, Gem\u00e4ldegalerie, 1512\n*The Lamentation of Christ, Berlin, Gem\u00e4ldegalerie, 1516\n*Pyramus and Thisbe, Berlin, Gem\u00e4ldegalerie, around 1530\n*The Mass of St. Gregory, Cleveland, Cleveland Museum of Art, 1511\n*Christ as a gardener, Darmstadt, Hessen State Museum, 1539\n*The Adoration of the Magi, Dessau, Anhalt Art Gallery, 1510\n*Adam and Eva, Florence, Galleria degli Uffizi - Uffizi  \n*Frankfurt am Main, St\u00e4del The Baptism of Christ . 1518\n*Portrait of a youth, Hampton Court, Royal Collection  1509\n*The unlikely couple, Liverpool, Walker Art Gallery, 1527\n*Portrait of a man, London, National Gallery, 1514 \n* [[The Three Ages of Man and Death]], Museo del Prado, Madrid\n*The Holy Trinity, London, National Gallery, 1512\n*Venus with Cupid, Otterlo, Rijksmuseum Kr\u00f6ller-M\u00fcller, 1525\n*Phyllis and Aristotle, Paris, Louvre . 1503\n*Stockholm, National Museum Mercury as a planet God . for 1530-1540\n*Vienna, Paintings Gallery of the Academy of Fine Arts The Rest on the Flight into Egypt . 1513\n\n{{Clear}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\" 135px\" caption=\"Selected works\">\nFile:Hans Baldung - Die Heilige Jungfrau als K\u00f6nigin des Himmels mit dem Christkind.jpg|The Virgin as Queen of Heaven with the Christ Child in her arms\nFile:Hans Baldung - Mater Dolorosa - WGA01205.jpg|Mater Dolorosa \nFile:Hans Baldung Grien - Ruhe auf der Flucht der heiligen Familie nach \u00c4gypten.jpg|''Ruhe auf der Flucht der heiligen Familie nach \u00c4gypten''\nFile:Baldung FR Hochaltar.02.JPG|Nativity\nFile:Hans Baldung Grien - Venus and Amor - Google Art Project.jpg| Venus and Amor \nFile:Hans Baldung Grien - Adam - Google Art Project.jpg|Hans Baldung Grien - Adam \nFile:Hans Baldung Grien - Eve - Google Art Project.jpg|Hans Baldung Grien - Eve \nFile:Hans Baldung - The Three Graces - WGA01196.jpg|[[Charites|The Three Graces]]\nFile:Hans Baldung called Grien - Lucretia - Google Art Project.jpg| Lucretia.

The hammered dulcimer is set before the musician, who, in more traditional styles, may sit cross legged on the floor, or at a more modern style of standing or sitting at a wooden stand on legs. The player holds a small spoon shaped [[mallet]] hammer in each hand to strike the strings (''[[cf.]]'' [[Appalachian dulcimer]]). The Graeco-Roman ''dulcimer'' (sweet song) derives from the [[Latin]] ''dulcis'' (sweet) and the Greek ''melos'' (song). The dulcimer, in which the strings are beaten with small hammers, originated from the [[psaltery]], in which the strings are plucked.<ref name=merr-web>{{cite web|title=Definition of DULCIMER|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dulcimer?show=0&t=1343588430|publisher=Merriam-Webster, Incorporated|accessdate=29 July 2012}}</ref> \nHammered dulcimers, and other similar instruments, are traditionally played in [[Iraq]], [[India]], [[Iran]], [[Southwest Asia]], [[China]], and parts of [[Southeast Asia]], [[Central Europe]] ([[Hungary]], [[Slovenia]], [[Romania]], [[Slovakia]], [[Poland]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Switzerland]] (particularly [[Appenzell]]), [[Austria]] and [[Bavaria]]), the Balkans, [[Eastern Europe]] ([[Ukraine]] and [[Belarus]]) and [[Scandinavia]]. The instrument is also played in the [[United Kingdom]] ([[Wales]], [[East Anglia]], [[Northumbria]]) and the [[United States|U.S.]], where its traditional use in [[folk music]] saw a notable revival in the late 20th century.<ref>Groce, Nancy, ''The Hammered Dulcimer in America''.

The bass bridge holds up bass strings, which are played to the left of the bridge. The treble strings can be played on either side of the treble bridge. In the usual construction, playing them on the left side gives a note a fifth higher than playing them on the right of the bridge.\n\nThe dulcimer comes in various sizes, identified by the number of strings that cross each of the bridges. A 15/14, for example, has 15 strings crossing the treble bridge and 14 crossing the bass bridge, and can span three [[octave]]s. The strings of a hammered dulcimer are usually found in pairs, two strings for each note (though some instruments have three or four strings per note). Each set of strings is tuned in [[unison]] and is called a [[Course (music)|course]]. As with a [[piano]], the purpose of using multiple strings per course is to make the instrument louder, although as the courses are rarely in perfect unison, a [[chorus effect]] usually results like a [[mandolin]]. A hammered dulcimer, like an [[autoharp]], [[harp]], or piano, requires a [[tuning wrench]] for tuning, since the dulcimer's strings are wound around tuning pins with square heads. (Ordinarily, 5&nbsp;mm \"zither pins\" are used, similar to, but smaller in diameter than piano tuning pins, which come in various sizes ranging upwards from \"1/0\" or 7&nbsp;mm.)\n\nThe strings of the hammered dulcimer are often tuned according to a [[circle of fifths]] pattern.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rizzetta|first=Sam|title=Hammer Dulcimer: History and Playing|url=http://www.si.edu/Encyclopedia_Si/nmah/hdhist.htm|work=Encyclopedia Smithsonian|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=3 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Traditional or Fifth-Interval Tuning|url=http://manufacturing.dustystrings.com/instrumentbuilding/hammereddulcimers/models/traditionaltuning/tabid/684/Default.aspx|publisher=Dusty Strings|accessdate=3 June 2013}}</ref>   Typically, the lowest note (often a G or D) is struck at the lower right-hand of the instrument, just to the left of the right-hand (bass) bridge. As a player strikes the courses above in sequence, they ascend following a repeating sequence of two whole steps and a half step. With this tuning, a [[diatonic scale]] is broken into two [[tetrachord]]s, or groups of four notes. For example, on an instrument with D as the lowest note, the D major scale is played starting in the lower-right corner and ascending the bass bridge: D \u2013 E \u2013 F{{sharp}} \u2013 G. This is the lower tetrachord of the D major scale. At this point the player returns to the bottom of the instrument and shifts to the treble strings to the right of the treble bridge to play the higher tetrachord: A \u2013 B \u2013 C{{Music|#}} \u2013 D. The player can continue up the scale on the right side of the treble bridge with E \u2013 F{{sharp}} \u2013 G \u2013 A \u2013 B, but the next note will be C, not C{{sharp}}, so he or she must switch to the left side of the treble bridge (and closer to the player) to continue the D major scale. See the drawing on the left above, in which \"DO\" would correspond to D (see [[Movable do solf\u00e8ge]]).\n\nThe shift from the bass bridge to the treble bridge is required because the bass bridge's fourth string G is the start of the lower tetrachord of the G scale. The player could go on up a couple notes (G - A - B), but the next note will be a flatted seventh (C natural in this case), because this note is drawn from the G tetrachord. This D major scale with a flatted seventh is the [[mixolydian mode]] in D.\n\nThe same thing happens as the player goes up the treble bridge \u2013 after getting to [[Movable do solf\u00e8ge|La]] (B in this case), one has to go to the left of the treble bridge. Moving from the left side of the bass bridge to the right side of the treble bridge is analogous to moving from the right side of the treble bridge to the left side of the treble bridge.\n\nThe whole pattern can be shifted up by three courses, so that instead of a D-major scale one would have a G-major scale, and so on. This transposes one [[equally tempered]] scale to another. Shifting down three courses transposes the D-major scale to A-major, but of course the first Do-Re-Mi would be shifted off the instrument.\n\nThis tuning results in most, but not all, notes of the [[chromatic scale]] being available. To fill in the gaps, many modern dulcimer builders include extra short bridges at the top and bottom of the soundboard, where extra strings are tuned to some or all of the missing pitches. Such instruments are often called \"chromatic dulcimers\" as opposed to the more traditional \"diatonic dulcimers\".\n\nThe tetrachord markers found on the bridges of most hammered dulcimers in the [[English-speaking world]] were introduced by the American player and maker [[Sam Rizzetta]] in the 1960s.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rizzetta|first=Sam|title=Luthier Spotlight Sam Rizzetta and Music, Dulcimer Sessions|work=Encyclopedia Smithsonian|publisher=Mel Bay|accessdate=9 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn the Alps there are also chromatic dulcimers with crossed strings, which are in a whole tone distance in every row. This chromatic ''Salzburger hackbrett'' was developed in the mid 1930s from the diatonic hammered dulcimer by Tobi Reizer and his son along with Franz Peyer and Heinrich Bandzauner. In the postwar period it was one of the instruments taught in state-sponsored music schools.<ref>Gifford, Paul M., ''The Hammered Dulcimer: A History'', Lanham, Maryland: Scarecrow Press, 2001. Page 81.</ref>\n\nHammered dulcimers of non-European descent may have other tuning patterns, and builders of European-style dulcimers sometimes experiment with alternate tuning patterns.\n\n==Hammers==\nThe instrument is referred to as hammered in reference to the small [[Percussion mallet|mallets]] (referred to as ''hammers'') that players use to strike the strings. Hammers are usually made of [[wood]] (most likely hard woods such as maple, cherry, padauk, oak, walnut, or any other hard wood), but can also be made from any material, including [[metal]] and [[plastic]]. In the Western hemisphere, hammers are usually stiff, but in Asia, flexible hammers are often used. The head of the hammer can be left bare for a sharp attack sound, or can be covered with [[adhesive tape]], [[leather]], or [[Textile|fabric]] for a softer sound. \nTwo-sided hammers are also available. The heads of two sided hammers are usually oval or round. Most of the time, one side is left as bare wood while the other side may be covered in leather or a softer material such as piano felt.\n\nSeveral traditional players have used hammers that differ substantially from those in common use today. [[Paul Van Arsdale]] (b. 1920), a player from upstate [[New York (state)|New York]], uses flexible hammers made from [[hacksaw]] blades, with leather-covered wooden blocks attached to the ends (these are modeled after the hammers used by his grandfather, Jesse Martin). The [[Ireland|Irish]] player [[John Rea (musician)|John Rea]] (1915\u20131983) used hammers made of thick steel wire, wound with wool. He made these himself from old bicycle spokes. [[Billy Bennington]] (1900\u20131986), a player from [[Norfolk]] in [[England]], used cane hammers bound with wool.\n\n== Variants and adaptations ==\n[[File:Th. Steinweg Nachf. Braunschweig.jpg|thumb|A piano]]\n\nThe hammered dulcimer was extensively used during the Middle Ages in England, France, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands and Spain. Although it had a distinctive name in each country, it was everywhere regarded as a kind of [[Psalterium (instrument)|psalterium]]. The importance of the method of setting the strings in [[vibration]] by means of hammers, and its bearing on the [[acoustics]] of the instrument, were recognized only when the invention of the [[piano]]forte had become a matter of history. It was then perceived that the psalterium in which the strings were plucked, and the dulcimer in which they were struck, when provided with keyboards, gave rise to two distinct families of instruments, differing essentially in [[tone quality]], in technique and in capabilities: the [[evolution]] of the psalterium stopped at the [[harpsichord]], that of the dulcimer gave us the pianoforte.<ref>{{Cite EB1911 |last=Schlesinger |first=Kathleen |authorlink=Kathleen Schlesinger |wstitle=Dulcimer }}</ref>\n\n==Around the world==\n{{Listen|filename=Payvar-Dehlavi-Concertino for Santur.ogg|title=Concertino for Santur and Orchestra, by Faramarz Payvar and Hossein Dehlavi.|description=|format=[[Ogg]]}}\n[[File:Oprekelj - ugla\u0161evanje.jpg|thumb|Tuning of a hammered dulcimer (southeastern Slovenia)]]\nVersions of the hammered dulcimer are used throughout the world. In Eastern Europe, a larger descendant of the hammered dulcimer called the [[cimbalom]] is played and has been used by a number of [[Classical music|classical]] [[composer]]s, including [[Zolt\u00e1n Kod\u00e1ly]], [[Igor Stravinsky]] and [[Pierre Boulez]]. The [[khim]] is the name of both the [[Thailand|Thai]] and the [[Khmer people|Khmer]] hammered dulcimer.\n\nThe [[santur]] or [[santoor]] is a type of hammered dulcimer that originated in [[Mesopotamia]] and is found in Iran, Iraq and India.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of hammered dulcimer players]]\n* [[Santoor]]\n* [[Santur]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Gifford, Paul M.

In formulating his teaching he explained why he did not accept the conclusions of the [[Pontifical Commission on Birth Control]] established by his predecessor, [[Pope John XXIII]], a commission he himself had expanded.<ref>See encyclical, n.6.</ref>\n\nMainly because of its prohibition of artificial contraception (some licit therapeutic procedures with the sole intent to cure bodily diseases are excepted)<ref>http://w2.vatican.va/content/paul-vi/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-vi_enc_25071968_humanae-vitae.html</ref>, the encyclical was politically controversial. It affirmed traditional Church [[Catholic moral theology|moral teaching]] on the [[sanctity of life]] and the procreative and unitive nature of conjugal relations.\n\nIt was the last of Paul's seven encyclicals.<ref name=\"paulvi\" />\n\n==Summary==\n\n===Affirmation of traditional teaching===\nIn this encyclical Paul VI reaffirmed the Catholic Church's orthodox view of marriage and marital relations and a continued condemnation of \"artificial\" [[contraception|birth control]]. There were two Papal committees and numerous independent experts looking into the latest advancement of science and medicine on the question of artificial birth control,<ref>([http://www.zenit.org/english/visualizza.phtml?sid=38825 ''Germain Grisez on Human\u00e6 Vitae, Then and Now''], Retrieved 2 March 2006</ref> which were noted by the Pope in his encyclical.<ref name=HV_2-8>''Humanae Vitae'', nos. 2-8</ref> The expressed views of Paul VI reflected the teachings of his predecessors, especially [[Pius XI]],<ref>Pius XI, encyc.letter ''Divini illius Magistri'': AAS 22 (1930), pgs. 58-61; encyc. letter ''Casti connubii'': AAS 22 (1930), pgs. 545-546</ref> [[Pius XII]]<ref>Discorsi e radiomessaggi di Pio XII, VI, pgs. 191-2; to Italian Association of Catholic Midwives: AAS 43 (1951), pgs. 835-54</ref> and [[John XXIII]],<ref>John XXIII, encyc. letter ''Mater et magistra'': AAS 53 (1961), pg. 457</ref> all of whom had insisted on the divine obligations of the marital partners in light of their partnership with God the creator.\n\n===Doctrinal basis===\n{{POV section|date=January 2013}}\nPaul VI himself, even as commission members issued their personal views over the years, always reaffirmed the teachings of the Church, repeating them more than once in the first years of his Pontificate.<ref>''Herder Korrespondenz'', Orbis Catholicus Freiburg, Herder Verlag, 1964-1968</ref>\n\nTo Pope Paul VI, as with of all his predecessors, marital relations are much more than a union of two people. In his view, They constitute a union of the loving couple with a loving God, in which the two persons generate the matter for the body, while God creates the unique soul of a person. For this reason, Paul VI teaches in the first sentence of ''Humanae Vitae'', that the \"transmission of human life is a most serious role in which married people collaborate freely and responsibly with God the Creator.\"<ref name=HV_1>''Humanae vitae'', no. 1</ref> This is divine partnership, so Paul VI does not allow for arbitrary human decisions, which may limit divine providence. According to Paul VI, marital relations are a source of great joy, but also of difficulties and hardships.<ref name=\"HV_1\" /> The question of human [[procreation]] with God, exceeds in the view of Paul VI specific disciplines such as [[biology]], [[psychology]], [[demography]] or [[sociology]].<ref name=HV_7>''Humane vitae'', no. 7</ref> According to Paul VI, married love takes its origin from God, who is love, and from this basic dignity, he defines his position:\n{{quote |text=Love is total \u2014 that very special form of personal friendship in which husband and wife generously share everything, allowing no unreasonable exceptions and not thinking solely of their own convenience. Whoever really loves his partner loves not only for what he receives, but loves that partner for the partner's own sake, content to be able to enrich the other with the gift of himself.<ref name=HV_8-9>''Humanae vitae'', nos. 8-9</ref>}}\n\nThe encyclical opens with an assertion of the competency of the [[magisterium]] of the Catholic Church to decide questions of morality. It then goes on to observe that circumstances often dictate that married couples should limit the number of children, and that the sexual act between husband and wife is still worthy even if it can be foreseen not to result in procreation. Nevertheless, it is held that the sexual act must retain its intrinsic relationship to the procreation of human life.\n\nEvery action specifically intended to prevent procreation is forbidden, except in medically necessary circumstances. Therapeutic means necessary to cure diseases are exempted, even if a foreseeable impediment to procreation should result, but only if infertility is not directly intended.<ref name=HV>''Humanae vitae''</ref> This is held to directly contradict the moral order which was established by God. [[Abortion]], even for therapeutic reasons, is absolutely forbidden, as is [[Human sterilization|sterilization]], even if temporary. Therapeutic means which induce infertility are allowed (''e.g.'', [[hysterectomy]]), if they are not specifically intended to cause infertility (e.g., the uterus is cancerous, so the preservation of life is intended). If there are well grounded reasons (arising from the physical or psychological condition of husband or wife, or from external circumstances), [[Natural family planning]] methods (abstaining from intercourse during certain parts of the [[menstrual cycle]]) are allowed, since they take advantage of a faculty provided by nature.<ref name=HV/>\n\nThe acceptance of artificial methods of birth control is then claimed to result in several negative consequences, among them a general lowering of moral standards resulting from sex without consequences, and the danger that men may reduce women to being a mere instrument for the satisfaction of [their] own desires; finally, abuse of power by public authorities, and a false sense of autonomy.<ref name=HV_17>''Humanae vitae'', no. 17</ref>\n\n===Appeal to natural law and conclusion===\nPublic authorities should oppose laws which undermine [[natural law]];<ref name=HV_23>''Humanae vitae'', no. 23</ref> scientists should further study effective methods of natural birth control; doctors should further familiarize themselves with this teaching, in order to be able to give advice to their patients,<ref name=HV_27>''Humanae vitae'', no. 27</ref> priests must spell out clearly and completely the Church's teaching on marriage.<ref name=HV_28>''Humanae vitae'', no. 28</ref> The encyclical acknowledges that \"perhaps not everyone will easily accept this particular teaching\", but that \"...it comes as no surprise to the church that she, no less than her Divine founder is destined to be a sign of contradiction.\" <ref name=HV_17/> Noted is the duty of proclaiming the entire moral law, \"both natural and evangelical.\"<ref name=HV_17/> The encyclical also points out that the Roman Catholic Church cannot \"declare lawful what is in fact unlawful\", because she is concerned with \"safeguarding the holiness of marriage, in order to guide married life to its full human and Christian perfection.\"<ref name=HV_30>''Humane vitae'', no. 30</ref> This is to be the priority for his fellow bishops and priests and lay people. The Pope predicts that future progress in social cultural and economic spheres will make marital and family life more joyful, provided God's design for the world is faithfully followed.<ref name=HV_30/> The encyclical closes with an appeal to observe the natural laws of the Most High God. \"These laws must be wisely and lovingly observed.\"<ref name=HV_31>''Humanae vitae'', no. 31</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\n{{See also|Christian views on contraception}}\nThere had been a long-standing general Christian prohibition on contraception and abortion, with such Church Fathers as [[Clement of Alexandria]] and [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] condemning the practices.

As Vatican Council II was concluding, Pope Paul VI enlarged it to fifty-eight members, including married couples, laywomen, theologians and bishops. The last document issued by the council (''Gaudium et spes'') contained a section titled \"Fostering the Nobility of Marriage\" (1965, nos. 47-52), which discussed marriage from the personalist point of view. The \"duty of responsible parenthood\" was affirmed, but the determination of licit and illicit forms of regulating birth was reserved to Pope Paul VI. In the spring of 1966, following the close of the council, the commission held its fifth and final meeting, having been enlarged again to include sixteen bishops as an executive committee. The commission was only consultative but it submitted a report approved by a majority of 64 members to Paul VI. It proposed he approve at least some form of contraception for married couples. A minority of four members opposed this report and issued a parallel report to the Pope.<ref>[{{cite book | last = Rausch | first = Thomas P.  | title = Catholicism in the Third Millennium | publisher = [[Liturgical Press]] | edition = 2nd | location = Collegeville, MN | date = 2003 | page = 148 | isbn = 0-8146-5899-7}}]</ref> After two more years of study and consultation, the pope issued ''Humanae vitae'', which removed any doubt that the Church views hormonal anti-ovulants as contraceptive.

Wojty\u0142a had earlier defended the church's position from a philosophical standpoint in his 1960 book ''[[Love and Responsibility]]''. Wojty\u0142a's position was strongly considered and it was reflected in the final draft of the encyclical, although much of his language and arguments were not incorporated. Weigel attributes much of the poor reception of the encyclical to the omission of many of Wojty\u0142a's arguments.<ref>{{cite book|last=Weigel|first=George| title= Witness to Hope|publisher=HarperCollins |origyear=1999|year=2001 |isbn=0-06-018793-X |quote=The encyclical was not drafted precisely as Wojtyla proposed.}}</ref>\n\nIn 2017, anticipating the 50th anniversary of the encyclical, four theologians led by Mgr.

Men rightly observe that a conjugal act imposed on one's partner without regard to his or her condition or personal and reasonable wishes in the matter, is no true act of love, and therefore offends the moral order in its particular application to the intimate relationship of husband and wife. If they further reflect, they must also recognize that an act of mutual love which impairs the capacity to transmit life which God the Creator, through specific laws, has built into it, frustrates His design which constitutes the norm of marriage, and contradicts the will of the Author of life. Hence to use this divine gift while depriving it, even if only partially, of its meaning and purpose, is equally repugnant to the nature of man and of woman, and is consequently in opposition to the plan of God and His holy will. But to experience the gift of married love while respecting the laws of conception is to acknowledge that one is not the master of the sources of life but rather the minister of the design established by the Creator. Just as man does not have unlimited dominion over his body in general, so also, and with more particular reason, he has no such dominion over his specifically sexual faculties, for these are concerned by their very nature with the generation of life, of which God is the source. \"Human life is sacred\u2014all men must recognize that fact,\" Our predecessor Pope John XXIII recalled. \"From its very inception it reveals the creating hand of God.\"<ref>See John XXIII,  encyc. letter Mater et Magistra: AAS 53 (1961), pg. 447 [TPS VII, pg. 331].</ref>\n\n===Lawful therapeutic means===\n15. ...the Church does not consider at all illicit the use of those therapeutic means necessary to cure bodily diseases, even if a foreseeable impediment to procreation should result therefrom &mdash; provided such impediment is not directly intended.\n\n===Recourse to infertile periods===\n16. ...If therefore there are well-grounded reasons for spacing births, arising from the physical or psychological condition of husband or wife, or from external circumstances, the Church teaches that married people may then take advantage of the natural cycles immanent in the reproductive system and engage in marital intercourse only during those times that are infertile, thus controlling birth in a way which does not in the least offend the moral principles which We have just explained.\n\n===Concern of the Church===\n18. It is to be anticipated that perhaps not everyone will easily accept this particular teaching. There is too much clamorous outcry against the voice of the Church, and this is intensified by modern means of communication. But it comes as no surprise to the Church that it, no less than its divine Founder, is destined to be a \"sign of contradiction.\"<ref>Lk 2. 34</ref>) The Church does not, because of this, evade the duty imposed on it of proclaiming humbly but firmly the entire moral law, both natural and evangelical. Since the Church did not make either of these laws, it cannot be their arbiter\u2014only their guardian and interpreter. It could never be right for the Church to declare lawful what is in fact unlawful, since that, by its very nature, is always opposed to the true good of man. In preserving intact the whole moral law of marriage, the Church is convinced that it is contributing to the creation of a truly human civilization. The Church urges man not to betray his personal responsibilities by putting all his faith in technical expedients. In this way it defends the dignity of husband and wife. This course of action shows that the Church, loyal to the example and teaching of the divine Savior, is sincere and unselfish in its regard for men whom it strives to help even now during this earthly pilgrimage \"to share God's life as sons of the living God, the Father of all men\".\n\n===Developing countries===\n23. We are fully aware of the difficulties confronting the public authorities in this matter, especially in the developing countries. In fact, We had in mind the justifiable anxieties which weigh upon them when We published Our encyclical letter ''Populorum Progressio''. But now We join Our voice to that of Our predecessor John XXIII of venerable memory, and We make Our own his words: \"No statement of the problem and no solution to it is acceptable which does violence to man's essential dignity; those who propose such solutions base them on an utterly materialistic conception of man himself and his life. The only possible solution to this question is one which envisages the social and economic progress both of individuals and of the whole of human society, and which respects and promotes true human values.\"<ref>John XXIII, Encyc. letter ''Mater et Magistra'': AAS 53 (1961), pg. 447 [TPS VII, pg. 331]</ref> No one can, without being grossly unfair, make divine Providence responsible for what clearly seems to be the result of misguided governmental policies, of an insufficient sense of social justice, of a selfish accumulation of material goods, and finally of a culpable failure to undertake those initiatives and responsibilities which would raise the standard of living of peoples and their children.<ref>See Paul VI, encyc. letter ''Populorum progressio'' #48-55: AAS 59 (1967), pgs. 281-4 [TPS XII, pgs. 160-2] \"If only all governments which were able would do what some are already doing so nobly, and bestir themselves to renew their efforts and their undertakings!

The teaching has been criticized by development organizations and others who claim that it limits the methods available to fight worldwide population growth and struggle against [[HIV/AIDS]]. Within two days of the encyclical's release, a group of dissident theologians, led by Rev. [[Charles Curran (theologian)|Charles Curran]], then of [[The Catholic University of America]], issued a statement stating, \"spouses may responsibly decide according to their conscience that artificial contraception in some circumstances is permissible and indeed necessary to preserve and foster the value and sacredness of marriage.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://americamagazine.org/node/148840 | work=America | title=Humanae Vitae 25 Years Later | date=7 July 1993 | accessdate=11 November 2013 | first1=Richard | last1=McCormick}}</ref>\n\n===Canadian bishops===\nTwo months later, the controversial \"[[Winnipeg Statement]]\" issued by the [[Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops]] stated that those who cannot accept the teaching should not be considered shut off from the Catholic Church, and that individuals can in good conscience use contraception as long as they have first made an honest attempt to accept the difficult directives of the encyclical.\n\n===Dutch Catechism===\nThe Dutch Catechism of 1966, based on the Dutch bishops' interpretation of the just completed Vatican Council, and the first post-Council comprehensive Catholic catechism, noted the lack of mention of artificial contraception in the Council.   \"As everyone can ascertain nowadays, there are several methods of regulating births. The Second Vatican Council did not speak of any of these concrete methods\u2026 This is a different standpoint than that taken under Pius XI some thirty years which was also maintained by his successor ... we can sense here a clear development in the Church, a development, which is also going on outside the Church.\"<ref>''A New Catechism'', pg. 402</ref>\n\n===Soviet Union===\nIn the [[Soviet Union]], ''Literaturnaja Gazeta'', a publication of Soviet intellectuals, included an editorial and statement by  Russian physicians against the encyclical.<ref>HK 1968, pg. 548</ref>\n\n===Ecumenical reactions===\nEcumenical reactions were mixed. Liberal and Moderate [[Lutheran]]s and the [[World Council of Churches]] were disappointed.

With the encyclical, he wanted to express consideration for human life. He explained his intention to some of his friends by using a comparison: although one must not lie, sometimes it is not possible to do otherwise; it may be necessary to conceal the truth, or it may be unavoidable to tell a lie.

They along with numerous Catholic authors and speakers such as such as [[Christopher West]], [[Matt Fradd]], [[Jason Evert]], and [[Leah Darrow]] are currently advancing a deeper appreciation and understanding of the Church's teaching regarding sex and marriage. At the official level, Catholicism\u2019s commitment to ''Humanae Vitae'' is more stable than ever.  According to [[John L. Allen, Jr.]], \"In addition, three decades of bishops\u2019 appointments by John Paul II and Benedict XVI, both unambiguously committed to ''Humanae Vitae'', mean that senior leaders in Catholicism these days are far less inclined than they were in 1968 to distance themselves from the ban on birth control, or to soft-pedal it. Some Catholic bishops have brought out documents of their own defending ''Humanae Vitae''.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/27/opinion/27allen.html | work=New York Times | title=The Pope vs. the Pill | date=27 July 2008 | accessdate=19 January 2012 | first1=John | last1=Allen}}</ref>  Also, developments in [[fertility awareness]] since the 1960s <ref>For example, one Natural Birth Control website (Justisse) quotes the ''British Medical Journal'' (Volume 307, 2003): \"According to the World Health Organization, 93% of women everywhere can identify the symptoms which distinguish adequately between the fertile and the infertile phases of the [menstrual] cycle\u2026 [Using fertility awareness for reproductive planning] is inexpensive, highly effective, without side effects and may be particularly acceptable to and efficacious among [certain] people.\" {{cite web|title=World Health Organization Endorses Fertility Awareness|publisher=Justisse|url=http://www.justisse.ca/new/index.asp|accessdate=27 March 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061214225809/http://www.justisse.ca/new/index.asp |archivedate=14 December 2006}}</ref> have given rise to [[natural family planning]] organizations such as the Billings Ovulation Method, [[Couple to Couple League]] and the [[Creighton Model FertilityCare System]], which actively provide formal instruction on the use and reliability of natural methods of birth control.\n\n===Pope John Paul I===\n[[Albino Luciani]]'s views on ''Humanae vitae'' have been debated.<ref>Kay Withers, \"Pope John Paul I and Birth Control\", ''America'', 24 March 1979, pp. 233-34.</ref> Journalist [[John L. Allen, Jr.]] claims that \"it's virtually certain that John Paul I would not have reversed Paul VI\u2019s teaching, particularly since he was no doctrinal radical. Moreover, as Patriarch in [[Venice]] some had seen a hardening of his stance on social issues as the years went by.\" According to Allen \"...it is reasonable to assume that John Paul I would not have insisted upon the negative judgment in ''Humanae Vitae'' as aggressively and publicly as John Paul II did, and probably would not have treated it as a quasi-infallible teaching. It would have remained a more 'open' question\".<ref>[http://www.nationalcatholicreporter.org/word/word090503.htm ''National Catholic Reporter'']</ref><ref>Kay Withers, \"Pope John Paul I and Birth Control\", ''America'', 24 March 1979, pgs. 233-4</ref> Other sources take a different view and note that during his time as Patriarch of Venice that \"Luciani was intransigent with his upholding of the teaching of the Church and severe with those, through intellectual pride and disobedience paid no attention to the Church's prohibition of contraception\", though while not condoning the sin, he was tolerant of those who sincerely tried and failed to live up to the Church's teaching. The book states that \"...if some people think that his compassion and gentleness in this respect implies he was against Humane Vitae one can only infer it was wishful thinking on their part and an attempt to find an ally in favor of artificial contraception.\"<ref>Raymond and Lauretta, ''The Smiling Pope, The Life & Teaching of John Paul I''. Our Sunday Visitor Press: 2004</ref>\n\n===Pope John Paul II===\nAfter he became pope in 1978, [[John Paul II]] continued on the [[Catholic Theology of the Body]] of his predecessors with a series of lectures, entitled ''[[Theology of the Body]]'', in which he talked about an ''original unity between man and women'',<ref>{{cite book|first=George|last=Weigel|title=Witness to hope, The biography of Pope John Paul II|location=New York|year=2005|page=336}}</ref> purity of heart (on the [[Sermon on the Mount]]), [[marriage]] and [[celibacy]] and reflections on ''Humanae vitae'', focusing largely on responsible parenthood and marital chastity.<ref>Weigel, pgs. 336-43</ref>\n\nIn 1981, the Pope's Apostolic exhortation, [[Familiaris consortio]] restated the Church's opposition to artificial birth control stated previously in Humanae vitae.\n\nJohn Paul II readdressed some of the same issues in his 1993 encyclical [[Veritatis Splendor|''Veritatis splendor'']]. He reaffirmed much of ''Humanae vitae'', and specifically described the practice of artificial contraception as an act not permitted by Catholic teaching in any circumstances. The same encyclical also clarifies the use of conscience in arriving at moral decisions, including in the use of contraception. However, John Paul also said, \u201cIt is not right then to regard the moral conscience of the individual and the magisterium of the Church as two contenders, as two realities in conflict. The authority which the magisterium enjoys by the will of Christ exists so that the moral conscience can attain the truth with security and remain in it.\u201d John Paul quoted ''Humanae vitae'' as a compassionate encyclical, \"Christ has come not to judge the world but to save it, and while he was uncompromisingly stern towards sin, he was patient and rich in mercy towards sinners\".<ref>''Veritatis Splendor'', pg. 95; see ''Humanae vitae'', no. 29</ref>\n\nPope John Paul's 1995 encyclical, ''[[Evangelium vitae]]'' (\"The Gospel of Life\"), affirmed the Church's position on contraception and multiple topics related to [[Culture of life]].\n\n===Pope Benedict XVI===\nOn 12 May 2008, [[Benedict XVI]] accepted an invitation to talk to participants in the International Congress organized by the [[Pontifical Lateran University]] on the 40th anniversary of ''Humanae vitae''. He put the encyclical in the broader view of love in a global context, a topic he called \"so controversial, yet so crucial for humanity's future.\" ''Humanae vitae'' became \"a sign of contradiction but also of continuity of the Church's doctrine and tradition... What was true yesterday is true also today.\"<ref>Benedict XVI, international congress organized by the Pontifical Lateran University on the 40th anniversary of the encyclical ''Humanae vitae'', 12 May 2008</ref> The Church continues to reflect  \"in an ever new and deeper way on the fundamental principles that concern marriage and procreation.\" The key message of ''Humanae vitae'' is love. Benedict states, that the fullness of a person is achieved by a unity of soul and body, but neither spirit nor body alone can love, only the two together. If this unity is broken, if only the body is satisfied, love becomes a commodity.<ref>Quoted from ''Deus Caritas Est''</ref>\n\n===Pope Francis===\nOn 16 January 2015, Pope Francis said to a meeting with families in Manila, insisting on the need to protect the family: \"The family is ...threatened by growing efforts on the part of some to redefine the very institution of marriage, by relativism, by the culture of the ephemeral, by a lack of openness to life. I think of Blessed Paul VI. At a time when the problem of population growth was being raised, he had the courage to defend openness to life in families. He knew the difficulties that are there in every family, and so in his Encyclical he was very merciful towards particular cases, and he asked confessors to be very merciful and understanding in dealing with particular cases. But he also had a broader vision: he looked at the peoples of the earth and he saw this threat of the destruction of the family through the privation of children [original Spanish: destrucci\u00f3n de la familia por la privaci\u00f3n de los hijos]. Paul VI was courageous; he was a good pastor and he warned his flock of the wolves who were coming.\"<ref>https://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/es/speeches/2015/january/documents/papa-francesco_20150116_srilanka-filippine-incontro-famiglie.html</ref><ref>http://opinion.inquirer.net/82016/the-popes-most-insistent-message</ref>\n\nA year before, on 1 May 2014, [[Pope Francis]], in an interview given to Italian newspaper ''Corriere della Sera'', expressed his opinion and praise for ''Humanae Vitae'': \"Everything depends on how ''Humanae Vitae'' is interpreted. Paul VI himself, in the end, urged confessors to be very merciful and pay attention to concrete situations. But his genius was prophetic, he had the courage to take a stand against the majority, to defend moral discipline, to exercise a cultural restraint, to oppose present and future neo-Malthusianism. The question is not of changing doctrine, but of digging deep and making sure that pastoral care takes into account situations and what it is possible for persons to do.\"<ref>[http://chiesa.espresso.repubblica.it/articolo/1350783?eng=y Francis, the Pope of \"Humanae Vitae\", Chiesa.Espressonline.it, Article By Sandro Magister, 1 May 2014]</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book\n | last = Wojty\u0142a | first = Karol\n | authorlink = Karol Wojty\u0142a\n | title = Love and Responsibility\n | publisher = Ignatius Press\n | isbn = 0-89870-445-6 | year = 1993}}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Smith | first = Janet\n | title = Why Humanae Vitae Was Right: A Reader\n | publisher = Ignatius Press\n | isbn = 0-89870-433-2 | year = 1993}}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Shivanandan | first = Mary\n | title = Crossing the Threshold of Love: A New Vision of Marriage\n | publisher = Catholic University of America Press\n | isbn =  0-8132-0941-2 | year = 1999}}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Hahn | first = Kimberly\n | title = Life-Giving Love\n | publisher = Charis Books\n | isbn =  0-8132-0941-2 | year = 2002}}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Kippley | first = John F.\n | title = Sex and the Marriage Covenant: A Basis for Morality\n | publisher =  Ignatius Press\n | isbn =  0-89870-973-3 | year = 2005}}\n* {{cite book\n | last = McClory | first = Robert\n | title = Turning point: the inside story of the Papal Birth Control Commission, and how Humanae Vitae changed the life of Patty Crowley and the future of the church\n | publisher = Crossroads Publishing\n | isbn = 0-8245-1458-0 | year = 1995}}\n* {{cite journal\n | last = Rubio | first = Julie Hanlon\n | title = Beyond the LIberal/Conservative Divide on Contraception\n | journal = [[Horizons (journal)|Horizons: the Journal of the College Theology Society]]\n | publisher = Villanova University\n | volume = 32 | issue = 2\n |date=Fall 2005}}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Dominion | first = Jack\n |author2=Hugh Montefiore\n | title = God, Sex and Love\n | publisher = SCM Press | year = 1989}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.webcitation.org/5xI2Wz6n5?url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-vi_enc_25071968_humanae-vitae_en.html ''Humanae vitae'', official English translation]\n* [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-vi_enc_25071968_humanae-vitae_lt.html Original Latin text of ''Humanae vitae'']\n* [http://www.viastuas.net.au/bc/WeigelHV.html The Humanae Vitae controversy], chapter from George Weigel's biography of Karol Wojty\u0142a\n* [[G.

The idea of using automated machinery beyond the [[printing press]] to build a more useful encyclopedia can be traced to [[Paul Otlet]]'s 1934 book ''Trait\u00e9 de documentation''; Otlet also founded the [[Mundaneum]], an institution dedicated to indexing the world's knowledge, in 1910. This concept of a machine-assisted encyclopedia was further expanded in [[H. G. Wells]]' book of essays ''[[World Brain]]'' (1938) and [[Vannevar Bush]]'s future vision of the [[microfilm]]-based [[Memex]] in his essay \"[[As We May Think]]\" (1945).<ref name =reaglechap2>Reagle, Joseph (2010).

While previous encyclopedias, notably the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'', were book-based, Microsoft's [[Encarta]], published in 1993, was available on CD-ROM and [[hyperlink]]ed. The development of the [[World Wide Web]] led to many attempts to develop [[internet encyclopedia project]]s.

Nupedia, by contrast, had produced barely two dozen articles.

As Nupedia was then structured, no stage of the editorial process could proceed before the previous stage was completed. Kovitz brought up the wiki and sketched out \"[[wiki magic]]\", the mysterious process by which communities with common interests work to improve wiki pages by incremental contributions. If it worked for the rambunctious hacker culture of programming, Kovitz said, it could work for any online collaborative project. The wiki could break the Nupedia bottleneck by permitting volunteers to work simultaneously all over the project. With Kovitz in tow, Sanger rushed back to his apartment and called Wales to share the idea.

The goals and methods of GNUpedia were nearly identical to Wikipedia: anyone can contribute, small contributions welcome, plan on taking years, narrow focus on encyclopedic content as the primary goal, anyone can read articles, anyone can mirror articles, anyone can translate articles, use libre-licensed code to run the site, encourage peer review, and rely primarily on volunteers. GNUpedia was roughly intended to be a combination of Wikipedia and also [[Wikibooks]]. The main exceptions were:\n\n# The strong prohibition against *any* sort of centralized control (\"[must not be] written under the direction of a single organization, which made all decisions about the content, and... published in a centralized fashion. ...we dare not allow any organization to decide what counts as part of [our encyclopedia]\"). In particular, [[deletionist]]s were not allowed; editing an article would require [[fork (software development)|forking]] it, making a change, and then saving the result as a 'new' article on the same topic.\n# Assuming attribution for articles (rather than anonymous by default), requiring attribution for quotations, and allowing original authors to control straightforward translations, In particular, the idea was to have a set of N articles covering the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]], with some to-be-determined mechanism for readers to endorse/rank/like/plus/star the version of the article they found best.\n# Given the structure above, where every topic (especially controversial ones) might have a thousand articles purporting to be *the* GNUpedia article about [[Sarah Palin]], Stallman explicitly rejected the idea of a centralized website that would specify which article of those thousand was worth reading. Instead of an official [[card catalogue|catalogue]], the plan was to rely on search engines at first (the reader would begin by [[googling]] \"gnupedia sarah palin\"), and then eventually if necessary construct catalogues according to the same principles as articles were constructed.

As railroads overtook canals for transportation, canal systems were modified and developed into hydropower systems; the [[history of Lowell, Massachusetts]] is a classic example of commercial development and industrialization, built upon the availability of water power.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://library.uml.edu/clh/Malone/notes_01.pdf|title=Waterpower in Lowell|publisher=University of Massachusetts|accessdate=28 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nTechnological advances had moved the open water wheel into an enclosed [[turbine]] or [[Water engine|water motor]]. In 1848 [[James B. Francis]], while working as head engineer of Lowell's Locks and Canals company, improved on these designs to create a turbine with 90% efficiency.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} He applied scientific principles and testing methods to the problem of turbine design. His mathematical and graphical calculation methods allowed the confident design of high-efficiency turbines to exactly match a site's specific flow conditions.  The [[Francis turbine|Francis reaction turbine]] is still in wide use today. In the 1870s, deriving from uses in the California mining industry, [[Lester Allan Pelton]] developed the high efficiency [[Pelton wheel|Pelton wheel impulse turbine]], which utilized hydropower from the high head streams characteristic of the mountainous California interior.\n\n=== Hydraulic power-pipe networks ===\n[[Hydraulic power network]]s used pipes to carry pressurized water and transmit mechanical power from the source to end users. The power source was normally a head of water, which could also be assisted by a pump. These were extensive in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] cities in the United Kingdom. A hydraulic power network was also developed in [[Geneva]], Switzerland. The world-famous [[Jet d'Eau]] was originally designed as the over-pressure relief valve for the network.<ref name=geneva>{{cite web|url=http://www.geneve-tourisme.ch/?rubrique=0000000172|title=Things to do in Geneva, Switzerland - Geneva Tourism Official Website|website=www.geneve-tourisme.ch}}</ref>\n\n=== Compressed air hydro ===\n{{See also|Trompe}}\nWhere there is a plentiful head of water it can be made to generate [[compressed air]] directly without moving parts. In these designs, a falling column of water is purposely mixed with air bubbles generated through turbulence or a venturi pressure reducer at the high-level intake. This is allowed to fall down a shaft into a subterranean, high-roofed chamber where the now-compressed air separates from the water and becomes trapped. The height of the falling water column maintains compression of the air in the top of the chamber, while an outlet, submerged below the water level in the chamber allows water to flow back to the surface at a lower level than the intake. A separate outlet in the roof of the chamber supplies the compressed air. A facility on this principle was built on the [[Montreal River (Timiskaming District)|Montreal River]] at Ragged Shutes near [[Cobalt, Ontario]] in 1910 and supplied 5,000 horsepower to nearby mines.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Maynard|first=Frank|date=November 1910|title=Five thousand horsepower from air bubbles|journal=Popular Mechanics|pages=633|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-N0DAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>\n\n== Hydropower types ==\n{{Main article|Hydroelectricity}}\nHydropower is used primarily to generate [[electricity]]. Broad categories include:\n* [[Hydroelectricity#Generating methods|Conventional hydroelectric]], referring to hydroelectric dams.\n* [[Run-of-the-river hydroelectricity]], which captures the kinetic energy in rivers or streams, without a large reservoir and sometimes without the use of dams.\n* [[Small hydro]] projects are 10 megawatts or less and often have no artificial reservoirs.\n* [[Micro hydro]] projects provide a few kilowatts to a few hundred kilowatts to isolated homes, villages, or small industries.\n* [[Conduit hydroelectricity]] projects utilize water which has already been diverted for use elsewhere; in a municipal water system, for example.\n* [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity]] stores water pumped uphill into reservoirs during periods of low demand to be released for generation when demand is high or system generation is low.\n* [[Pressure buffering hydropower]] use natural sources (waves for example) for water pumping to turbines while exceeding water is pumped uphill into reservoirs and releases when incoming water flow isn't enough.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" mode=\"packed\" caption=\"\" widths=\"250px\" heights=\"165px\">\nFile:Hydroelectric dam.svg|A [[Hydroelectricity#Generating methods|conventional]] dammed-hydro facility (hydroelectric dam) is the most common type of hydroelectric power generation.\nFile:Hongping-Power-Station-5425.jpg|Hongping Power station, in Hongping Town, [[Shennongjia]], has a design typical for [[small hydro]] stations in the western part of China's [[Hubei]] Province.

Power is a function of the [[hydraulic head]] and [[rate of fluid flow]]. The head is the energy per unit weight (or unit mass) of water. The static head is proportional to the difference in height through which the water falls. Dynamic head is related to the velocity of moving water. Each unit of water can do an amount of work equal to its weight times the head.\n\nThe power available from falling water can be calculated from the flow rate and density of water, the height of fall, and the local acceleration due to gravity.\nIn SI units, the power is:\n\n<math>P=\\eta\\rho\\,Qgh\\!</math>\n\nwhere\n* P is power in watts\n* \u03b7 is the dimensionless efficiency of the turbine\n* \u03c1 is the density of water in kilograms per cubic metre\n* Q is the flow in cubic metres per second\n* g is the acceleration due to gravity\n* h is the height difference between inlet and outlet in metres\n\nTo illustrate, power is calculated for a turbine that is 85% efficient, with water at 1000&nbsp;kg/cubic metre (62.5 pounds/cubic foot) and a flow rate of 80 cubic-meters/second (2800 cubic-feet/second), gravity of 9.81 metres per second squared and with a net head of 145&nbsp;m (480&nbsp;ft).\n\nIn SI units:\n:<math>\\text{Power (W)}  = 0.85\\times 1000 \\times 80 \\times 9.81 \\times 145 </math> which gives 97 MW\n\nIn English units, the density is given in pounds per cubic foot so acceleration due to gravity is inherent in the unit of weight. A conversion factor is required to change from foot lbs/second to kilowatts:\n:<math>\\text{Power (W)} = 0.85\\times 62.5 \\times 2800 \\times 480 \\times 1.356 </math> which gives 97 MW (130,000 [[horsepower]])\n\nOperators of hydroelectric stations will compare the total electrical energy produced with the theoretical potential energy of the water passing through the turbine to calculate efficiency. Procedures and definitions for calculation of efficiency are given in test codes such as [[ASME]] PTC 18 and [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] 60041. Field testing of turbines is used to validate the manufacturer's guaranteed efficiency. Detailed calculation of the efficiency of a hydropower turbine will account for the head lost due to flow friction in the power canal or penstock, rise in tail water level due to flow, the location of the station and effect of varying gravity, the temperature and barometric pressure of the air, the density of the water at ambient temperature, and the altitudes above sea level of the forebay and tailbay. For precise calculations, errors due to rounding and the number of [[significant digit]]s of constants must be considered.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nSome hydropower systems such as [[water wheel]]s can draw power from the flow of a body of water without necessarily changing its height. In this case, the available power is the [[kinetic energy]] of the flowing water. Over-shot water wheels can efficiently capture both types of energy.<ref>{{cite book|last1=S.

Development of a hydropower site requires analysis of [[streamflow|flow records]], sometimes spanning decades, to assess the reliable annual energy supply. Dams and reservoirs provide a more dependable source of power by smoothing seasonal changes in water flow. However reservoirs have significant [[Environmental impact of reservoirs|environmental impact]], as does alteration of naturally occurring stream flow. The design of dams must also account for the worst-case, \"probable maximum flood\" that can be expected at the site; a [[spillway]] is often included to bypass flood flows around the dam. A computer [[Hydrological modelling|model of the hydraulic basin]] and rainfall and snowfall records are used to predict the maximum flood.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\n== Sustainability ==\n{{see also|Environmental impact of reservoirs}}\nAs with other forms of economic activity, hydropower projects can have both a positive and a negative environmental and social impact, because the construction of a dam and power plant, along with the impounding of a reservoir, creates certain social and physical changes.<ref>{{Cite web|title = The Allure and Perils of Hydropower |url = https://undark.org/article/hydropower-dams-albania-vjosa/|website = www.undark.org|accessdate = 2017-11-17}}</ref>\nHydropower projects can also have indirect consequences, contributing to [[global warming]]: reservoirs accumulate plant material, which then decomposes, emitting [[methane]] in uneven bursts.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/09/hundreds-new-dams-could-mean-trouble-our-climate |title=Hundreds of new dams could mean trouble for our climate|work=Science |date=September 28, 2016|accessdate= 2016-10-11 |doi=10.1126/science.aah7356|publisher=AAAS}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/50/9/766/269391|title=Reservoir Surfaces as Sources of Greenhouse Gases to the Atmosphere: A Global Estimate: Reservoirs are sources of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, and their surface areas have increased to the point where they should be included in global inventories of anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases|first1=St|last1=Louis|first2=Vincent|last2=L|first3=Carol A.|last3=Kelly|first4=\u00c9ric|last4=Duchemin|first5=John W.

Some breeds have been developed through centuries of crossings with other breeds, while others, such as [[Tennessee Walking Horse]]s and [[Morgan horse|Morgans]], developed from a [[foundation bloodstock|single sire]] from which all current breed members descend. There are more than 300&nbsp;horse breeds in the world today.<ref>Hedge ''Horse Conformation'' pp. 307\u2013308</ref>\n\n==Origin of breeds==\n{{seealso|Domestication of the horse|Horse}}\n\nModern horse breeds developed in response to a need for \"form to function\", the necessity to develop certain physical characteristics in order to perform a certain type of work.<ref name=Sponenberg155>Sponenberg, \"The Proliferation of Horse Breeds\", p. 155</ref> Thus, powerful but refined breeds such as the [[Andalusian horse|Andalusian]] or the [[Lusitano]] developed in the [[Iberian peninsula]] as riding horses that also had a great aptitude for [[dressage]],<ref name=Sponenberg155/> while heavy draft horses such as the [[Clydesdale (horse)|Clydesdale]] and the [[Shire horse|Shire]] developed out of a need to perform demanding [[farm]] work and pull heavy wagons.<ref>Sponenberg, \"The Proliferation of Horse Breeds\",  pp. 156\u201357</ref> Ponies of all breeds originally developed mainly from the need for a [[working animal]] that could fulfill specific local draft and transportation needs while surviving in harsh environments. However, by the 20th century, many pony breeds had [[Arabian horse|Arabian]] and other blood added to make a more refined pony suitable for riding.<ref>Sponenberg, \"The Proliferation of Horse Breeds\", pp. 155, 170-173</ref> Other horse breeds developed specifically for light agricultural work, heavy and light carriage and road work, various equestrian disciplines, or simply as pets.<ref name=Spon162>Sponenberg, \"The Proliferation of Horse Breeds\",  p. 162</ref>\n\n==Purebreds and registries==\n{{main|Breed registry|Purebred}}\nHorses have been [[Selective breeding|selectively bred]] since their [[domestication of the horse|domestication]]. Today, there are over 300 breeds of horses in the world.{{citation needed|date=January 2009}}  However, the concept of [[purebred]] bloodstock and a controlled, written [[breed registry]] only became of significant importance in modern times.  Today, the standards for defining and registration of different breeds vary. Sometimes purebred horses are called [[Thoroughbred]]s, which is incorrect; \"Thoroughbred\" is a specific breed of horse, while a \"purebred\" is a horse (or any other animal) with a defined [[Pedigree chart|pedigree]] recognized by a breed registry.<ref name=Ensminger424>Ensminger ''Horses and Horsemanship'' p. 424</ref> \n\nAn early example of people who practiced selective horse breeding were the [[Bedouin]], who had a reputation for careful breeding practices, keeping extensive pedigrees of their [[Arabian horse]]s and placing great value upon pure bloodlines.<ref>Edwards ''The Arabian'', pp. 22\u201323</ref> Though these pedigrees were originally transmitted via an [[oral tradition]], written pedigrees of Arabian horses can be found that date to the 14th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.waho.org/History.html |title=Is Purity the Issue? |accessdate=2008-04-29 |work=WAHO Publication Number 21 January 1998 |publisher=World Arabian Horse Organization |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705105054/http://www.waho.org/Purityissue.html |archivedate=5 July 2008 |df= }}</ref> In the same period of the early [[Renaissance]], the [[Carthusian]] monks of southern [[Spain]] bred horses and kept meticulous pedigrees of the best bloodstock; the lineage survives to this day in the [[Andalusian horse]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.ansi.okstate.edu/breeds/horses/andalusian/index.htm|title= Andalusian|accessdate= 2008-04-29|work= Breeds of Livestock|publisher= Oklahoma State University|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080312061526/http://www.ansi.okstate.edu/breeds/horses/andalusian/index.htm|archivedate= 2008-03-12|df= }}</ref> One of the earliest formal registries was [[General Stud Book]] for Thoroughbreds, which began in 1791 and traced back to the Arabian stallions imported to England from the Middle East that became the [[foundation bloodstock|foundation]] stallions for the breed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishhorseracing.com/goracing/racing/racehorses/history.asp |title=History of Thoroughbreds |accessdate=2008-04-03 |work=Britishhorseracing.com |publisher=British Horseracing Authority |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201154621/http://www.britishhorseracing.com/goracing/racing/racehorses/history.asp |archivedate=2014-02-01 |df= }}</ref>\n\nSome breed registries have a [[closed stud book]], where registration is based on pedigree, and no outside animals can gain admittance.

Most of the [[warmblood]] breeds used in [[sport horse]] disciplines, have open stud books to varying degrees. While pedigree is considered, outside bloodlines are admitted to the registry if the horses meet the set standard for the registry.  These registries usually require a [[studbook selection]] process involving judging of an individual animal's quality, performance, and [[Equine conformation|conformation]] before registration is finalized.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.americanwarmblood.org/|title= What Is A Warmblood Anyway?|accessdate=2008-05-01 |author= Bernhold, Suzette|work= Warmblood Whisper|publisher= American Warmblood Society}}</ref> A few \"registries,\" particularly some [[color breed]] registries, are very open and will allow membership of all horses that meet limited criteria, such as coat color and species, regardless of pedigree or conformation.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.palominohorseassoc.com/regandmembershipins.htm|title= Registration and Membership Instructions|accessdate=2008-05-01 |publisher= Palomino Horse Association}}</ref><ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.pintohorseregistry.com/RulesProcedures.html|title=Registration Procedure|publisher=National Pinto Horse Registry|accessdate=2008-09-28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012133616/http://www.pintohorseregistry.com/RulesProcedures.html|archivedate=2008-10-12|df=}}</ref>\n\nBreed registries also differ as to their acceptance or rejection of breeding technology. For example, all [[Jockey Club]] Thoroughbred registries require that a registered Thoroughbred be a product of a natural mating, so called \"live cover\". A [[foal]] born of two Thoroughbred parents, but by means of [[artificial insemination]] or [[embryo transfer]], cannot be registered in the Thoroughbred studbook.<ref name=JockeyClub/> On the other hand, since the advent of [[DNA]] testing to verify parentage, most breed registries now allow artificial insemination (AI), embryo transfer (ET), or both. The high value of stallions has helped with the acceptance of these techniques because they allow a stallion to breed more mares with each \"collection,\" and greatly reduce the risk of injury during mating.<ref>{{cite journal |author= McAfee, Melonyce |date=2007-01-30|title= Did They Save Barbaro's Semen? |journal= Slate  |url= http://www.slate.com/id/2158610/ |accessdate=2008-05-01}}</ref> [[Cloning]] of horses is highly controversial, and at the present time most mainstream breed registries will not accept cloned horses, though several cloned horses and mules have been produced.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Mott, Maryann |date=2006-04-04|title= Champion Horses Cloned by Texas Breeder |journal= National Geographic News  |url= http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/04/0404_060404_horse_clone.html |accessdate=2008-05-01}}</ref> Such restrictions have led to legal challenges in the United States, sometime based on state law and sometimes based on antitrust laws.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Becker|first1=Frank|title=Equine Law|date=2013|isbn=978-0-615-90347-7|page=207}}</ref>\n\n==Hybrids==\nHorses can [[crossbreed]] with other [[equine]] species to produce [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]]s.

It has distinguished itself by minimalism, irreverence, and a cast of regulars whose takes on suggested inventions are often funnier than the original submission.\n\n==Usage==\nHalfbakery can be read by anyone, but only logged-in users can contribute.  A user with an account can submit new ''ideas'' (the inventions) and add ''links'' and ''annotations'' to existing ideas. An account is currently\ngained by e-mailing the \"bakesperson,\" an e-mail address provided on the site. Logged in users can also vote ''for'' or ''against'' a particular idea. Users are able to edit and delete their ideas, links, annotations, votes, and even their whole account. A few selected users can illustrate ideas, and the illustrations are linked to on the idea's page.\n\nThe site is run by the bakesperson, jutta, and a small group of volunteer moderators who can contribute ideas themselves and have rights to delete ideas, annotations and links provided by other users. Moderators, however, must adhere to guidelines and are generally forbidden from deleting the links or annotations of other users. Moderators are unable to see who cast votes or alter votes other than their own.\n\n==Ideas==\nHalfbakery has a variety of mechanisms for creating and discussing ideas.\n\nAn idea is initially created with the following components:\n* Title: This is usually short, and often makes use of a [[pun]] or [[alliteration]].\n* Category: There are many categories, which are created by the bakesperson as needed.\n* Summary: Used as a subtitle, this either clarifies the title, gives a summary or a humorous line.\n* Description: The details of the idea.\n\nOnce created, an idea can be discussed by other users.  Users can add annotations, include links to other Halfbaked ideas, and vote on the idea.  All user comments, links, and votes can be changed or removed by the users who posted them, and comments and links can also be removed by the idea creator.\n\n===Writing style===\nThe style of writing on the Halfbakery is distinctive. Close attention is paid to grammatical, semantical and spelling mistakes, in contrast to other online [[Internet forum|forums]]. Writing is seldom overly formal, but too much slang or contraction is frowned upon. Ideas can be either serious or satirical, but ideas written too formally are not well received. Lack of paragraph breaks usually draws criticism concerning the perceived readability. A common occurrence is a user giving a negative vote, promising to retract it once the offending mistakes have been removed.\n\n===Jargon===\nThere is a lot of Halfbakery jargon, due to its communal nature. Here are a few examples:\n\n* baked - the idea has already been built\n* half-baked - the idea already exists in fiction, or in the Halfbakery itself.\n* WTCTTISITMWIBNIIWR - \"Wasn't that cool, that thing I saw in the movie? Wouldn't it be neat if it were real?\"  (And several analogous formations.)  A complaint about lacking originality.\n* WIBNI - Wouldn't it be nice if. Used if something is impossible.\n* autoboner - a mythical user who votes against everything (\"bone\" is short for fishbone, the icon for a negative vote).\n* MFD - [marked-for-deletion], a search tag that can lead to idea deletion after moderator review (also used as a verb, meaning 'to mark an idea for deletion).\n* bone - same as fishbone, a vote against an idea (also used as a verb)\n* bun or pastry - same as croissant, or a vote for an idea (also used as a verb)\n* The symbols [+] and [-] used in an annotation to indicate if a user voted for or against an idea\n* HB, 1/2B, .5B, B/2, 'Bakery - Acronyms or Abbreviations for Halfbakery\n* Halfbaker, 'Baker - A user of the Halfbakery.\n\n===In-jokes===\nThe Halfbakery has a number of in-jokes. These mostly take the form of humorous misspellings, prodigious reference to things, or reference to several of the regular users. A few in-jokes are listed here, although the only way to know all of them is to be a regular user of the Halfbakery for some time.\n\n* elf - Used instead of self in many circumstances.\n* shirley - Used instead of surely, as in the 1980s movie ''[[Airplane!]]''\n* custard - will appear in many of the ideas, and is usually a guarantee of at least one croissant (although simply mentioning custard to try to get votes will not make you popular).\n* Synonymic naming - Many times when referring to another baker, synonyms are used for parts of their names\n* [[Van de Graaff generator]]s are another oft-appearing device on the Halfbakery.\n* TPPCPPC, Third Person Plural Conditional Past Perfect Continuous - a complicated tense, which makes use of a lot of [[auxiliary verbs]], that has become a standing joke since its inclusion in 'Third Person Plural Conditional Past Perfect Continuous Song Lyrics', an idea that is sadly no more.\n* [[buttered cat paradox|cat-and-buttered-toast]] - often used in reference to any perpetual motion device\n* the halfbakery logo changes for the day each Halloween\n* pirates - similar in usage to custard or mimes\n* Fishties - this is an infamous idea, which had the largest organised conspiracy on the HB. A user made an idea, for ties smelling of fish, and then got people to make an account and vote for it, with a comment mentioning the name of a country.\n* The Great Crash of Oct '04 (or Sept '04, or just '04) - a huge crash of the Halfbakery, in which all the data was lost. The Halfbakery was brought back to life using a combination of the [[Internet Archive#Wayback Machine|Wayback Machine]] and [[Google|Google's]] cache. There are still hundreds of abandoned accounts asking their owners to reclaim them, and links which lead nowhere.\n* Pedantry - being pedantic is considered, by some regulars, to be a virtue of sorts\n* Half - Due to the name of the site, any aspect of half-ness is given special significance. Even the voting scale is halved (-2.5 to 2.5 instead of -5 to 5).\n* Vagina Jam - an infamous idea often referenced in ideas that are only vaguely related.\n\n==References==\n{{nofootnotes|date=August 2018}}\n* Mentioned in ''[[Eats, Shoots & Leaves]]'' by [[Lynne Truss]], 2003 ({{ISBN|1-86197-612-7}}) as an example of online debate about punctuation.\n* [http://slashdot.org/articles/00/09/01/2039205.shtml Slashdot], article about [[Patent#Criticism|AntiPatenting]]; brings Halfbakery as an archetype site.\n* [https://archive.is/20130814221643/http://trends.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=01/07/26/2240242&tid=138&tid=12&tid=29&tid=31 NewsForge], article about Halfbakery and its bustling activity (200 new ideas a week) - article in the open source software online news site.\n* [http://www.advogato.org/person/jmason/diary.html?start=54 Active open-source developer Justin Mason's blog on anti-patenting, bringing Halfbakery as example site].\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060110055639/http://www.halfbakery.com/ The Halfbakery]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090107000741/http://web.media.mit.edu/~bcd/dsm/ass1/observe.html Observations about Halfbakery from a social perspective]\n\n[[Category:Ideas banks]]\n[[Category:Community websites]]\n[[Category:Comedy websites]]", "sha1": "i2utdlm9plkw1qixx21e4purqabd3ri"}}, {"title": "Horse breeding", "ns": "0", "id": "14082", "revision": {"id": "865465221", "parentid": "865465193", "timestamp": "2018-10-24T03:48:00Z", "contributor": {"username": "Shellwood", "id": "2366721"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Reverted edits by [[Special:Contributions/2600:1702:19C0:FB30:1C0E:AEB:F895:76FF|2600:1702:19C0:FB30:1C0E:AEB:F895:76FF]] ([[User talk:2600:1702:19C0:FB30:1C0E:AEB:F895:76FF|talk]]) ([[WP:HG|HG]]) (3.4.4)", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{refimprove|date=June 2013}}\n[[File:horses.london.750pix.jpg|thumb|Mares and a foal]]\n'''Horse breeding''' is reproduction in [[horse]]s, and particularly the human-directed process of [[selective breeding]] of animals, particularly [[purebred]] horses of a given [[Horse breed|breed]]. Planned matings can be used to produce specifically desired characteristics in [[domestication|domesticated]] horses.  Furthermore, modern breeding management and technologies can increase the rate of conception, a healthy pregnancy, and successful foaling.\n\n== Terminology ==\nThe male parent of a horse, a [[Stallion (horse)|stallion]], is commonly known as the ''sire'' and the female parent, the [[mare (horse)|mare]], is called the ''dam''.  Both are genetically important, as each parent provides half of the genetic makeup of the ensuing offspring, called a [[foal]].  Contrary to popular misuse, \"colt\" refers to a young male horse only; \"filly\" is a young female.  Though many horse owners may simply breed a family [[mare (horse)|mare]] to a local stallion in order to produce a companion animal, most professional breeders use [[selective breeding]] to produce individuals of a given [[phenotype]], or [[breed]]. Alternatively, a breeder could, using individuals of differing phenotypes, create a new breed with specific characteristics.\n\nA horse is \"bred\" where it is foaled (born). Thus a [[Colt (horse)|colt]] conceived in England but foaled in the United States is regarded as being bred in the US.<ref name=\"Montgomery\">Montgomery, E.S, \"The Thoroughbred\", Arco, New York, 1973 {{ISBN|0-668-02824-6}}</ref><ref>AJC & VRC, \"Australian Stud Book\", Vol. 31, Ramsay Ware Stockland Pty. Ltd., North Melbourne, 1980</ref> In some cases, most notably in the Thoroughbred breeding industry, American- and Canadian-bred horses may also be described by the state or province in which they are foaled. Some breeds denote the country, or state, where conception took place as the origin of the foal.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\nSimilarly, the \"breeder\", is the person who owned or leased the mare at the time of foaling. That individual may not have had anything to do with the mating of the mare.<ref name=\"Montgomery\" /><ref name=\"Stratton\">Stratton, Charles, The International Horseman's Dictionary, Lansdowne Press, Melbourne, 1978, {{ISBN|0-7018-0590-0}}</ref> It is important to review each breed registry's rules to determine which applies to any specific foal.\n\nIn the horse breeding industry, the term \"half-brother\" or \"half-sister\" only describes horses which have the same dam, but different sires.<ref name=\"EfH\">Summerhayes, RS, Encyclopaedia for Horsemen, Warne & Co, London & New York, 1966</ref> Horses with the same sire but different dams are simply said to be \"by the same sire\", and no [[sibling]] relationship is implied.<ref name=\"de Bourg\">de Bourg, Ross, \"The Australian and New Zealand Thoroughbred\", Nelson, West Melbourne, 1980, {{ISBN|0-17-005860-3}}</ref>  \"Full\" (or \"own\") siblings have both the same dam and the same sire.  The terms paternal half-sibling, and maternal half-sibling are also often used.  Three-quarter siblings are horses out of the same dam, and are by sires that are either half-brothers (i.e. same dam) or who are by the same sire.<ref name=\"Napier\">Napier, Miles, \"Blood Will Tell\", JA Allen & Co, London, 1977</ref>\n\n[[Thoroughbred]]s and [[Arabian horse|Arabians]] are also classified through the \"distaff\" or direct female line, known as their \"family\" or \"tail female\" line, tracing back to their taproot [[foundation bloodstock]] or the beginning of their respective [[breed registry|stud books]]. The female line of descent always appears at the bottom of a tabulated pedigree and is therefore often known as the ''bottom line''.<ref name=\"Napier\" />  In addition, the [[maternal grandfather]] of a horse has a special term: [[wikt:damsire|damsire]].\n\n\"[[Linebreeding]]\" technically is the duplication of fourth generation or more distant ancestors.<ref name=\"de Bourg\" />  However, the term is often used more loosely, describing horses with duplication of ancestors closer than the fourth generation.  It also is sometimes used as a [[euphemism]] for the practice of [[inbreeding]], a practice that is generally frowned upon by horse breeders, though used by some in an attempt to fix certain traits.\n\n== Estrous cycle of the mare ==\n{{See also|Horse anatomy#Reproductive system}}\n[[File:Astutus 2.jpg|thumb|Stallion checking a mare in estrus. The mare welcomes the stallion by lowering her rear and lifting her tail.]]\n\nThe [[estrous cycle]] (also spelled oestrous) controls when a mare is [[sexually receptive]] toward a stallion, and helps to physically prepare the mare for conception. It generally occurs during the spring and summer months, although some mares may be sexually receptive into the late fall, and is controlled by the [[photoperiod]] (length of the day), the cycle first triggered when the days begin to lengthen. The [[estrous cycle]] lasts about 19\u201322 days, with the average being 21 days. As the days shorten, the mare returns to a period when she is not sexually receptive, known as [[anestrus]]. Anestrus \u2013 occurring in the majority of, but not all, mares \u2013 prevents the mare from conceiving in the winter months, as that would result in her foaling during the harshest part of the year, a time when it would be most difficult for the foal to survive.\n\nThis cycle contains 2 phases:\n* Estrus, or Follicular, phase: 5\u20137 days in length, when the mare is sexually receptive to a stallion. [[Estrogen]] is secreted by the follicle. [[Ovulation]] occurs in the final 24\u201348 hours of estrus.\n* Diestrus, or Luteal, phase: 14\u201315 days in length, the mare is not sexually receptive to the stallion. The [[corpus luteum]] secretes [[progesterone]].\n\nDepending on breed, on average, 16% of mares have double ovulations, allowing them to twin, though this does not affect the length of time of estrus or diestrus.\n\n=== Effects on the reproductive system during the estrous cycle ===\nChanges in hormone levels can have great effects on the physical characteristics of the reproductive organs of the mare, thereby preparing, or preventing, her from conceiving.\n* '''Uterus''': increased levels of estrogen during estrus cause [[edema]] within the uterus, making it feel heavier, and the uterus loses its tone. This edema decreases following ovulation, and the muscular tone increases. High levels of progesterone do not cause edema within the uterus. The uterus becomes flaccid during anestrus.\n* '''Cervix''': the cervix starts to relax right before estrus occurs, with maximal relaxation around the time of ovulation. The secretions of the cervix increase. High progesterone levels (during diestrus) cause the cervix to close and become toned.\n* '''Vagina''': the portion of the vagina near the cervix becomes engorged with blood right before estrus. The vagina becomes relaxed and secretions increase.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n* '''Vulva''': relaxes right before estrus begins.

The cycle begins when the increased day length causes the [[pineal gland]] to reduce the levels of [[melatonin]], thereby allowing the [[hypothalamus]] to secrete GnRH.\n* '''GnRH ([[Gonadotropin releasing hormone]])''': secreted by the hypothalamus, causes the pituitary to release two gonadotrophins: LH and FSH.\n* '''LH ([[Luteinizing hormone]])''': levels are highest 2 days following ovulation, then slowly decrease over 4\u20135 days, dipping to their lowest levels 5\u201316 days after ovulation. Stimulates maturation of the follicle, which then in turn secretes estrogen. Unlike most mammals, the mare does not have an increase of LH right before ovulation.\n* '''FSH ([[Follicle-stimulating hormone]])''': secreted by the pituitary, causes the ovarian follicle to develop. Levels of FSH rise slightly at the end of estrus, but have their highest peak about 10 days before the next ovulation. FSH is inhibited by inhibin (see below), at the same time LH and estrogen levels rise, which prevents immature follicles from continuing their growth. Mares may however have multiple FSH waves during a single estrous cycle, and diestrus follicles resulting from a diestrus FSH wave are not uncommon, particularly in the height of the natural breeding season.\n* '''[[Estrogen]]''': secreted by the developing follicle, it causes the pituitary gland to secrete more LH (therefore, these 2 hormones are in a positive feedback loop). Additionally, it causes behavioral changes in the mare, making her more receptive toward the stallion, and causes physical changes in the cervix, uterus, and vagina to prepare the mare for conception (see above). Estrogen peaks 1\u20132 days before ovulation, and decreases within 2 days following ovulation.\n* '''[[Inhibin]]''': secreted by the developed follicle right before ovulation, \"turns off\" FSH, which is no longer needed now that the follicle is larger.\n* '''[[Progesterone]]''': prevents conception and decreases sexual receptibility of the mare to the stallion. Progesterone is therefore lowest during the estrus phase, and increases during diestrus. It decreases 12\u201315 days after ovulation, when the [[corpus luteum]] begins to decrease in size.\n* '''[[Prostaglandin]]''': secreted by the endrometrium 13\u201315 days following ovulation, causes luteolysis and prevents the corpus luteum from secreting progesterone\n* '''eCG \u2013 [[equine chorionic gonadotropin]] \u2013 also called PMSG (pregnant mare serum gonadotropin)''': chorionic gonadotropins secreted if the mare conceives. First secreted by the endometrial cups around the 36th day of gestation, peaking around day 60, and decreasing after about 120 days of gestation. Also help to stimulate the growth of the fetal gonads.\n* '''[[Prolactin]]''': stimulates lactation\n* '''[[Oxytocin]]''': stimulates the uterus to contract\n\n== Breeding and gestation ==\nWhile horses in the wild mate and foal in mid to late spring, in the case of horses domestically bred for competitive purposes, especially [[horse racing]], it is desirable that they be born as close to January 1 in the northern hemisphere or August 1 in the southern hemisphere as possible,<ref>The [[Australian Racing Board]] uses August 1 as its standard cutoff date, but also uses the date of conception to determine age. A foal born on or after July 1 of a given calendar year is included in the birth cohort of that calendar year if his or her dam was covered no later than August 31 of the previous calendar year. See {{cite web|url=http://www.australianracingboard.com.au/uploadimg/Rules260909.pdf |title=Rule AR.46 |work=Australian Rules of Racing |date=2009-09-29 |accessdate=2010-08-03}}</ref> so as to be at an advantage in size and maturity when competing against other horses in the same age group. When an early foal is desired, barn managers will put the mare \"under lights\" by keeping the barn lights on in the winter to simulate a longer day, thus bringing the mare into estrus sooner than she would in nature.  Mares signal estrus and ovulation by urination in the presence of a stallion, raising the tail and revealing the [[vulva]]. A [[Stallion (horse)|stallion]], approaching with a high head, will usually nicker, nip and nudge the mare, as well as [[Flehmen response|sniff her urine]] to determine her readiness for mating.\n\nOnce fertilized, the [[oocyte]] (egg) remains in the [[oviduct]] for approximately 5.5 more days, and then descends into the [[uterus]]. The initial single cell combination is already dividing and by the time of entry into the uterus, the egg might have already reached the [[blastocyst]] stage.\n\nThe [[gestation]] period lasts for about eleven months, or about 340 days (normal average range 320\u2013370 days). During the early days of pregnancy, the [[conceptus]] is mobile, moving about in the uterus until about day 16 when \"fixation\" occurs. Shortly after fixation, the [[embryo]] proper (so called up to about 35 days) will become visible on trans-rectal [[ultrasound]] (about day 21) and a heartbeat should be visible by about day 23. After the formation of the [[endometrial cup]]s and early placentation is initiated (35\u201340 days of gestation) the terminology changes, and the embryo is referred to as a [[fetus]]. True implantation \u2013 invasion into the endometrium of any sort \u2013 does not occur until about day 35 of pregnancy with the formation of the endometrial cups, and true [[placentation]] (formation of the placenta) is not initiated until about day 40-45 and not completed until about 140 days of pregnancy. The fetus sex can be determined by day 70 of the gestation using ultrasound. Halfway through gestation the fetus is the size of between a [[rabbit]] and a [[beagle]]. The most dramatic fetal development occurs in the last 3 months of pregnancy when 60% of fetal growth occurs.\n\nColts are carried on average about 4 days longer than fillies.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Hura |first=V |date=October 1997 |title=The effect of some factors on gestation length in nonius breed mares in Slovakia (Egyes t\u00e9nyez\u00f5k hat\u00e1sa a n\u00f3niusz fajta vemhess\u00e9g\u00e9nek id\u00f5tartam\u00e1ra)|journal=Proceedings of Roundtable Conference on Animal Biotechnology |volume=XIII |url=http://www.oai.hu/kerekasztal/XIII./hura.htm |accessdate= 2008-04-22 |display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\n=== Care of the pregnant mare ===\nDomestic mares receive specific care and nutrition to ensure that they and their foals are healthy. Mares are given vaccinations against diseases such as the [[Equine herpesvirus 1|Rhinopneumonitis]] (EHV-1) virus (which can cause abortions) as well as vaccines for other conditions that may occur in a given region of the world. Pre-foaling vaccines are recommended 4\u20136 weeks prior to foaling to maximize the [[immunoglobulin]] content of the [[colostrum]] in the first milk.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aaep.org/vaccination_passivetransfer.htm|title=Sign In|first=Advanced Solutions International,|last=Inc.|website=www.aaep.org}}</ref>  Mares are dewormed a few weeks prior to foaling, as the mare is the primary source of parasites for the foal.<ref>[http://www.aaep.org/health_articles_view.php?id=140 \"Expectant Mare: Assuring the Health and Well-Being of the Pregnant Mare\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415220750/http://www.aaep.org/health_articles_view.php?id=140 |date=2008-04-15 }}</ref>\n\nMares can be used for riding or driving during most of their pregnancy.  Exercise is healthy, though should be moderated when a mare is heavily in foal.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} Exercise in excessively high temperatures has been suggested as being detrimental to pregnancy maintenance during the embryonic period;<ref>Mortensen C, Choi YH, Hinrichs K, Ing N, Kraemer D, Vogelsang S, Vogelsang M. 2006.

However, during this time, the mare may be provided supplemental vitamins and minerals, particularly if forage quality is questionable.  During the last 3\u20134 months of gestation, rapid growth of the fetus increases the mare's nutritional requirements. Energy requirements during these last few months, and during the first few months of lactation are similar to those of a horse in full training.  Trace minerals such as copper are extremely important, particularly during the tenth month of pregnancy, for proper skeletal formation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://horse.purinamills.com/products/pregnantlactatingmare.asp|title=\"Nutritional Management of Pregnant and Lactating Mares\"|website=purinamills.com}}</ref> Many feeds designed for pregnant and [[lactation|lactating]] mares provide the careful balance required of increased protein, increased calories through extra fat as well as vitamins and minerals.  Overfeeding the pregnant mare, particularly during early gestation, should be avoided, as excess weight may contribute to difficulties foaling or fetal/foal related problems.\n\n== Foaling ==\n\n[[File:Baby gives birth to Tia.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A mare in the early stages of labor]]\n\nMares due to foal are usually separated from other horses, both for the benefit of the mare and the safety of the soon-to-be-delivered foal.  In addition, separation allows the mare to be monitored more closely by humans for any problems that may occur while giving birth.  In the [[northern hemisphere]] a special foaling stall that is large and clutter free is frequently used, particularly by major breeding farms.  Originally, this was due in part to a need for protection from the harsh winter climate present when mares foal early in the year, but even in moderate climates, such as [[Florida]], foaling stalls are still common because they allow closer monitoring of mares.  Smaller breeders often use a small [[pen (enclosure)|pen]] with a large shed for foaling, or they may remove a wall between two box stalls in a small barn to make a large stall.  In the milder climates seen in much of the [[southern hemisphere]], most mares foal outside, often in a [[Field (agriculture)|paddock]]<ref>[http://www.petalia.com.au/Templates/StoryTemplate_Process.cfm?specie=Horses&story_no=2166 ''Preparation for Foaling'' by Brad Dowling BVSc MVetClinStud FACVSc] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110207155236/http://petalia.com.au/Templates/StoryTemplate_Process.cfm?specie=Horses&story_no=2166 |date=2011-02-07 }} Retrieved 2011-2-7</ref><ref name=\"MD\">Delbridge, Arthur, \"The Macquarie Dictionary\", 2nd ed., Macquarie Library, North Ryde, 1991, p. 1274</ref> built specifically for foaling, especially on the larger [[stud farm]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbntv.com.au/index.php/2008/08/01/horsing-around-stud-style/#more-4997/|title=Foaling video on an Australian stud farm|website=nbntv.com.au|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090809204940/http://www.nbntv.com.au/index.php/2008/08/01/horsing-around-stud-style/#more-4997/|archivedate=2009-08-09|df=}}</ref> Many stud farms worldwide employ technology to alert human managers when the mare is about to foal, including [[webcam]]s, [[closed-circuit television]], or assorted types of devices that alert a handler via a remote alarm when a mare lies down in a position to foal.\n\nOn the other hand, some breeders, particularly those in remote areas or with extremely large numbers of horses, may allow mares to foal out in a field amongst a herd, but may also see higher rates of foal and mare mortality in doing so.\n\nMost mares foal at night or early in the morning, and prefer to give birth alone when possible.  Labor is rapid, often no more than 30 minutes, and from the time the feet of the foal appear to full delivery is often only about 15 to 20 minutes. Once the foal is born, the mare will lick the newborn foal to clean it and help blood circulation. In a very short time, the foal will attempt to stand and get milk from its mother. A foal should stand and nurse within the first hour of life.\n\nTo create a bond with her foal, the mare licks and nuzzles the foal, enabling her to distinguish the foal from others.  Some mares are aggressive when protecting their foals, and may attack other horses or unfamiliar humans that come near their newborns.\n\nAfter birth, a foal's navel is dipped in antiseptic to prevent infection, it is sometimes given an [[enema]] to help clear the [[meconium]] from its digestive tract, and the newborn is monitored to ensure that it stands and nurses without difficulty.   While most horse births happen without complications, many owners have first aid supplies prepared and a [[veterinarian]] on call in case of a birthing emergency.  People who supervise foaling should also watch the mare to be sure that she passes the [[placenta]] in a timely fashion, and that it is complete with no fragments remaining in the [[uterus]], where retained fetal membranes could cause a serious inflammatory condition ([[endometritis]]) and/or infection.  If the placenta is not removed from the stall after it is passed, a mare will often eat it, an instinct from the wild, where blood would attract predators.\n\n=== Foal care ===\n[[File:Finnhorse mare with foal.jpg|thumb|A foal with its mother, or dam]]\nFoals develop rapidly, and within a few hours a wild foal can travel with the herd.  In domestic breeding, the foal and dam are usually separated from the herd for a while, but within a few weeks are typically pastured with the other horses.  A foal will begin to eat hay, grass and grain alongside the mare at about 4 weeks old; by 10\u201312 weeks the foal requires more nutrition than the mare's milk can supply.  Foals are typically weaned at 4\u20138 months of age, although in the wild a foal may nurse for a year.\n\n== How breeds develop ==\n{{See also|List of horse breeds}}\nBeyond the appearance and [[equine conformation|conformation]] of a specific type of horse, breeders aspire to improve physical performance abilities. This concept, known as matching \"form to function,\" has led to the development of not only different breeds, but also families or bloodlines within breeds that are specialists for excelling at specific tasks.\n\nFor example, the [[Arabian horse]] of the desert naturally developed speed and endurance to travel long distances and survive in a harsh environment, and [[domestication]] by humans added a trainable disposition to the animal's natural abilities.  In the meantime, in northern [[Europe]], the locally adapted heavy horse with a thick, warm coat was domesticated and put to work as a [[farm]] animal that could pull a [[plow]] or wagon.  This animal was later adapted through selective breeding to create a strong but rideable animal suitable for the heavily armored [[knight]] in [[war horse|warfare]].\n\nThen, centuries later, when people in [[Europe]] wanted faster horses than could be produced from local horses through simple selective breeding, they imported [[Arabian horse|Arabians]] and other oriental horses to breed as an [[outcross]] to the heavier, local animals.  This led to the development of breeds such as the [[Thoroughbred]], a horse taller than the Arabian and faster over the distances of a few miles required of a European race horse or light [[cavalry]] horse. Another cross between oriental and European horses produced the [[Andalusian horse|Andalusian]], a horse developed in [[Spain]] that was powerfully built, but extremely nimble and capable of the quick bursts of speed over short distances necessary for certain types of combat as well as for tasks such as [[bullfighting]].\n\nLater, the people who settled the [[Americas]] needed a hardy horse that was capable of working with [[cattle]].  Thus, Arabians and Thoroughbreds were crossed on Spanish horses, both domesticated animals descended from those brought over by the [[Conquistadors]], and [[feral]] horses such as the [[Mustang (horse)|Mustangs]], descended from the Spanish horse, but adapted by [[natural selection]] to the ecology and climate of the west.  These crosses ultimately produced new breeds such as the [[American Quarter Horse]] and the [[Criollo (horse)|Criollo]] of [[Argentina]].\n\nIn modern times, these breeds themselves have since been selectively bred to further specialize at certain tasks.  One example of this is the [[American Quarter Horse]].  Once a general-purpose working [[ranch]] horse, different bloodlines now specialize in different events.  For example, larger, heavier animals with a very steady attitude are bred to give competitors an advantage in events such as [[team roping]], where a horse has to start and stop quickly, but also must calmly hold a full-grown [[Cattle#Terminology|steer]] at the end of a rope. On the other hand, for an event known as [[cutting]], where the horse must separate a [[cow]] from a herd and prevent it from rejoining the group, the best horses are smaller, quick, alert, athletic and highly trainable.  They must learn quickly, have conformation that allows quick stops and fast, low turns, and the best competitors have a certain amount of independent mental ability to anticipate and counter the movement of a cow, popularly known as \"cow sense.\"\n\nAnother example is the [[Thoroughbred]].  While most representatives of this breed are bred for [[horse racing]], there are also specialized bloodlines suitable as [[show hunter]]s or [[show jumping|show jumpers]].  The hunter must have a tall, smooth build that allows it to trot and canter smoothly and efficiently.  Instead of speed, value is placed on appearance and upon giving the equestrian a comfortable ride, with natural jumping ability that shows [[bascule (horse)|bascule]] and good form.\n\nA [[show jumping|show jumper]], however, is bred less for overall form and more for power over tall fences, along with speed, scope, and agility. This favors a horse with a good galloping stride, powerful hindquarters that can change speed or direction easily, plus a good shoulder angle and length of neck. A jumper has a more powerful build than either the hunter or the racehorse.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://practicalhorsemanmag.com/health-archive/which_thoroughbred_061008-11584|title=Which Thoroughbred Best Fits My Needs?|work=Expert how-to for English Riders|access-date=2018-10-13|language=en}}</ref>\n\n== History of horse breeding ==\nThe history of horse breeding goes back millennia.  Though the precise date is in dispute, humans could have domesticated the horse as far back as approximately 4500 BCE. However, evidence of planned breeding has a more blurry history. It is well known, for example, that the Romans did breed horses and valued them in their armies, but little is known regarding their breeding and husbandry practices: all that remains are statues and artwork. Mankind has plenty of equestrian statues of Roman emperors, horses are mentioned in the [[Odyssey]] by Homer, and hieroglyphics and paintings left behind by Egyptians tell stories of pharaohs hunting elephants from chariots. Nearly nothing is known of what became of the horses they bred for hippodromes, for warfare, or even for farming.\n\nOne of the earliest people known to document the breedings of their horses were the [[Bedouin]] of the [[Middle East]], the breeders of the [[Arabian horse]]. While it is difficult to determine how far back the Bedouin passed on pedigree information via an [[oral tradition]], there were written pedigrees of Arabian horses by CE 1330.<ref name=\"Pyramid Society\">{{cite web |url= http://www.pyramidarabians.com/news/articles/arabianmystique.html |title= Egyptian Arabians: The Mystique Unfolded |accessdate= 2006-05-10 |author= Lewis, Barbara S. |work= Arabians |publisher= Pyramid Arabians |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060508005004/http://www.pyramidarabians.com/news/articles/arabianmystique.html |archivedate= 2006-05-08 |df=  }}</ref>  The [[Akhal-Teke]] of West-Central [[Asia]] is another breed with roots in ancient times that was also bred specifically for war and racing. The nomads of the [[Mongolia]]n steppes bred horses for several thousand years as well, and the [[Caspian horse]] is believed to be a very close relative of Ottoman horses from the earliest origins of the Turks in Central Asia.\n\nThe types of horse bred varied with culture and with the times. The uses to which a horse was put also determined its qualities, including smooth amblers for riding, fast horses for carrying messengers, heavy horses for plowing and pulling heavy wagons, ponies for hauling cars of ore from mines, packhorses, carriage horses and many others.\n\n[[Middle Ages|Medieval]] Europe bred large horses specifically for war, called [[destrier]]s. These horses were the ancestors of the great heavy horses of today, and their size was preferred not simply because of the weight of the armor, but also because a large horse provided more power for the knight's lance. Weighing almost twice as much as a normal riding horse, the destrier was a powerful weapon in battle meant to act like a giant battering ram that could quite literally run down men on an enemy line.\n\nOn the other hand, during this same time, lighter horses were bred in northern Africa and the Middle East, where a faster, more agile horse was preferred. The lighter horse suited the raids and battles of desert people, allowing them to outmaneuver rather than overpower the enemy.  When Middle Eastern warriors and European knights collided in warfare, the heavy knights were frequently outmaneuvered.  The Europeans, however, responded by crossing their native breeds with [[oriental horse|\"oriental\" type horses]] such as the [[Arabian (horse)|Arabian]], [[Barb (horse)|Barb]], and [[Turkoman horse]]  This cross-breeding led both to a nimbler war horse, such as today's [[Andalusian horse]], but also created a type of horse known as a [[Courser (horse)|Courser]], a predecessor to the [[Thoroughbred]], which was used as a message horse.\n\nDuring the [[Renaissance]], horses were bred not only for war, but for [[classical dressage|haute ecole]] riding, derived from the most athletic movements required of a war horse, and popular among the elite nobility of the time. Breeds such as the [[Lipizzan]]  and the now extinct [[Neapolitan horse]] were developed from Spanish-bred horses for this purpose, and also became the preferred mounts of cavalry officers, who were derived mostly from the ranks of the nobility. It was during this time that firearms were developed, and so the light cavalry horse, a faster and quicker war horse, was bred for \"shoot and run\" tactics rather than the shock action as in the Middle Ages. Fine horses usually had a well muscled, curved neck, slender body, and sweeping mane, as the nobility liked to show off their wealth and breeding in paintings of the era.\n\nAfter [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] retook the British throne in 1660, horse racing, which had been banned by Cromwell, was revived. The [[Thoroughbred]] was developed 40 years later, bred to be the ultimate racehorse, through the lines of three [[foundation bloodstock|foundation]] [[Arabian horse|Arabian]] stallions and one Turkish horse.\n\nIn the 18th century, [[James Burnett, Lord Monboddo]] noted the importance of selecting appropriate parentage to achieve desired outcomes of successive generations.  Monboddo worked more broadly in the abstract thought of [[species]] relationships and evolution of species. The Thoroughbred breeding hub in Lexington, Kentucky was developed in the late 18th century, and became a mainstay in American racehorse breeding.\n\nThe 17th and 18th centuries saw more of a need for fine carriage horses in Europe, bringing in the dawn of the [[warmblood]]. The warmblood breeds have been exceptionally good at adapting to changing times, and from their carriage horse beginnings they easily transitioned during the 20th century into a sport horse type. Today's warmblood breeds, although still used for [[combined driving|competitive driving]], are more often seen competing in [[show jumping]] or [[dressage]].\n\nThe Thoroughbred continues to dominate the horse racing world, although its lines have been more recently used to improve warmblood breeds and to develop sport horses. The [[Selle Fran\u00e7ais|French saddle horse]] is an excellent example as is the [[Irish Sport Horse]], the latter being an unusual combination between a Thoroughbred and a draft breed.\n\nThe [[American Quarter Horse]] was developed early in the 18th century, mainly for quarter racing (racing \u00bc of a mile). Colonists did not have racetracks or any of the trappings of Europe that the earliest Thoroughbreds had at their disposal, so instead the owners of Quarter Horses would run their horses on roads that lead through town as a form of local entertainment. As the USA expanded West, the breed went with settlers as a farm and ranch animal, and \"cow sense\" was particularly valued: their use for herding cattle increased on rough, dry terrain that often involved sitting in the saddle for long hours. \n\nHowever, this did not mean that the original  \u00bc-mile races that colonists held ever went out of fashion, so today there are three types: the stock horse type, the racer, and the more recently evolving sport type. The racing type most resembles the finer-boned ancestors of the first racing Quarter Horses, and the type is still used for \u00bc-mile races. The stock horse type, used in western events and as a farm and patrol animal is bred for a shorter stride, an ability to stop and turn quickly, and an unflappable attitude that remains calm and focused even in the face of an angry charging steer. The first two are still to this day bred to have a combination of explosive speed that exceeds the Thoroughbred on short distances clocked as high as 55 mph, but they still retain the gentle, calm, and kindly temperament of their ancestors that makes them easily handled.\n\nThe [[Canadian horse]]'s origin corresponds to shipments of French horses, some of which came from Louis XIV's own stable and most likely were Baroque horses meant to be gentlemen's mounts. These were ill suited to farm work and to the hardscrabble life of the New World, so like the Americans, early Canadians crossed their horses with natives escapees. In time they evolved along similar lines as the Quarter Horse to the South as both the USA and Canada spread westward and needed a calm and tractable horse versatile enough to carry the farmer's son to school but still capable of running fast and running hard as a cavalry horse, a stockhorse, or a horse to pull a conestoga wagon. \n\nOther horses from North America retained a hint of their mustang origins by being either derived from stock that Native Americans bred that came in a rainbow of color, like the [[Appaloosa]] and [[American Paint Horse]].   with those East of the Mississippi River increasingly bred to impress and mimic the trends of the upper classes of Europe: The [[Tennessee Walking Horse]] and [[Saddlebred]] were originally plantation horses bred for their gait and comfortable ride in the saddle as a plantation master would survey his vast lands like an English lord.\n\nHorses were needed for heavy draft and carriage work until replaced by the automobile, truck, and tractor. After this time, draft and [[carriage]] horse numbers dropped significantly, though light riding horses remained popular for recreational pursuits. Draft horses today are used on a few small farms, but today are seen mainly for pulling and plowing competitions rather than farm work. Heavy harness horses are now used as an outcross with lighter breeds, such as the [[Thoroughbred]], to produce the modern [[warmblood]] breeds popular in [[sport horse]] disciplines, particularly at the [[Equestrian at the Summer Olympics|Olympic]] level.\n\n== Deciding to breed a horse ==\nBreeding a horse is an endeavor where the owner, particularly of the mare, will usually need to invest considerable time and money. For this reason, a horse owner needs to consider several factors, including:\n* Does the proposed breeding animal have valuable genetic qualities to pass on?\n* Is the proposed breeding animal in good physical health, fertile, and able to withstand the rigors of reproduction?\n* For what purpose will the foal be used?\n* Is there a market for the foal in the event that the owner does not wish to keep the foal for its entire life?\n* What is the anticipated economic benefit, if any, to the owner of the ensuing foal?\n* What is the anticipated economic benefit, if any, to the owner(s) of the sire and dam or the foal?\n* Does the owner of the mare have the expertise to properly manage the mare through [[gestation]] and [[parturition]]?\n* Does the owner of the potential foal have the expertise to properly manage and train a young animal once it is born?\n\nThere are [[value judgement]]s involved in considering whether an animal is suitable breeding stock, hotly debated by breeders.  Additional personal beliefs may come into play when considering a suitable level of care for the mare and ensuing foal, the potential market or use for the foal, and other tangible and intangible benefits to the owner.\n\nIf the breeding endeavor is intended to make a profit, there are additional market factors to consider, which may vary considerably from year to year, from breed to breed, and by region of the world.  In many cases, the low end of the market is saturated with horses, and the law of [[supply and demand]] thus allows little or no profit to be made from breeding unregistered animals or animals of poor quality, even if registered.\n\nThe minimum cost of breeding for a mare owner includes the [[stud fee]], and the cost of proper [[equine nutrition|nutrition]], [[horse care|management]] and [[veterinary medicine|veterinary]] care of the mare throughout gestation, parturition, and care of both mare and foal up to the time of weaning.  Veterinary expenses may be higher if specialized reproductive technologies are used or health complications occur.\n\nMaking a profit in horse breeding is often difficult.  While some owners of only a few horses may keep a foal for purely personal enjoyment, many individuals breed horses in hopes of making some money in the process.\n\nA rule of thumb is that a foal intended for sale should be worth three times the cost of the stud fee if it were sold at the moment of birth.  From birth forward, the costs of care and training are added to the value of the foal, with a sale price going up accordingly. If the foal wins awards in some form of competition, that may also enhance the price.\n\nOn the other hand, without careful thought, foals bred without a potential market for them may wind up being sold at a loss, and in a worst-case scenario, sold for \"salvage\" value\u2014a euphemism for sale to slaughter as [[horsemeat]].\n\nTherefore, a mare owner must consider their reasons for breeding, asking hard questions of themselves as to whether their motivations are based on either emotion or profit and how realistic those motivations may be.\n\n== Choosing breeding stock ==\n[[File:Totilas.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[Stallion (horse)|stallion]] with a proven competition record is one criterion for being a suitable sire.]]\nThe stallion should be chosen to complement the mare, with the goal of producing a foal that has the best qualities of both animals, yet avoids having the weaker qualities of either parent.   Generally, the stallion should have proven himself in the discipline or sport the mare owner wishes for the \"career\" of the ensuing foal.  Mares should also have a competition record showing that they also have suitable traits, though this does not happen as often.\n\nSome breeders consider the quality of the sire to be more important than the quality of the dam.  However, other breeders maintain that the mare is the most important parent.  Because stallions can produce far more offspring than mares, a single stallion can have a greater overall impact on a breed.  However, the mare may have a greater influence on an individual foal because its physical characteristics influence the developing foal in the womb and the foal also learns habits from its dam when young. Foals may also learn the \"language of intimidation and submission\" from their dam, and this [[imprinting (psychology)|imprinting]] may affect the foal's status and rank within the herd.<ref>McGreevy, Paul. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=PhEXRDFLK9kC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false Equine Behaviour \u2013 A Guide For Veterinarians and Equine Scientists].''{{Full citation needed|date=November 2012}}</ref> Many times, a mature horse will achieve status in a herd similar to that of its dam; the offspring of dominant mares become dominant themselves.\n{{See also|Horse behavior}}\n\nA purebred horse is usually worth more than a horse of mixed breeding, though this matters more in some disciplines than others.  The breed of the horse is sometimes secondary when breeding for a [[sport horse]], but some disciplines may prefer a certain [[list of horse breeds|breed]] or a specific [[phenotype]] of horse. Sometimes, [[purebred]] bloodlines are an absolute requirement:  For example, most [[horse racing|racehorses]] in the world must be recorded with a [[breed registry]] in order to race.\n\nBloodlines are often considered, as some bloodlines are known to cross well with others.  If the parents have not yet proven themselves by competition or by producing quality offspring, the bloodlines of the horse are often a good indicator of quality and possible strengths and weaknesses. Some bloodlines are known not only for their athletic ability, but could also carry a conformational or genetic defect, poor temperament, or for a medical problem. Some bloodlines are also fashionable or otherwise marketable, which is an important consideration should the mare owner wish to sell the foal.\n\nHorse breeders also consider conformation, size and temperament.  All of these traits are heritable, and will determine if the foal will be a success in its chosen discipline.  The offspring, or \"[[get (animal)|get]]\", of a stallion are often excellent indicators of his ability to pass on his characteristics, and the particular traits he actually passes on. Some stallions are fantastic performers but never produce offspring of comparable quality.  Others sire fillies of great abilities but not colts.  At times, a horse of mediocre ability sires foals of outstanding quality.\n\nMare owners also look into the question of if the stallion is fertile and has successfully \"settled\" (i.e. impregnated) mares.  A stallion may not be able to breed naturally, or old age may decrease his performance.  Mare care boarding fees and [[semen collection]] fees can be a major cost.\n\n== Costs related to breeding ==\nBreeding a horse can be an expensive endeavor, whether breeding a backyard competition horse or the next Olympic medalist. Costs may include:\n* The stud and booking fee\n* Fees for collecting, handling, and transporting semen (if AI is used and semen is shipped)\n* Mare exams: to determine if she is healthy enough to breed, to determine when she ovulates, and (if AI is used) to inseminate her\n* Mare transport, care, and board if the mare is bred live cover at the stallion's residence\n* Veterinary bills to keep the pregnant mare healthy while in foal\n* Possible veterinary bills during pregnancy or foaling should something go wrong\n* Veterinary bills for the foal for its first exam a few days following foaling\n\nStud fees are determined by the quality of the stallion, his performance record, the performance record of his get (offspring), as well as the sport and general market that the animal is standing for.\n\nThe highest stud fees are generally for racing [[Thoroughbred]]s, which may charge from two to three thousand dollars for a breeding to a new or unproven stallion, to several hundred thousand dollars for a breeding to a proven producer of stakes winners. Stallions in other disciplines often have stud fees that begin in the range of $1,000 to $3,000, with top contenders who produce champions in certain disciplines able to command as much as $20,000 for one breeding. The lowest stud fees to breed to a [[grade horse]] or an animal of low-quality pedigree may only be $100\u2013$200, but there are trade-offs: the horse will probably be unproven, and likely to produce lower-quality offspring than a horse with a stud fee that is in the typical range for quality breeding stock.\n\nAs a stallion's career, either performance or breeding, improves, his stud fee tends to increase in proportion. If one or two offspring are especially successful, winning several stakes races or an Olympic medal, the stud fee will generally greatly increase. Younger, unproven stallions will generally have a lower stud fee earlier on in their careers.\n\nTo help decrease the risk of financial loss should the mare die or abort the foal while pregnant, many studs have a [[live foal guarantee]] (LFG) \u2013 also known as \"no foal, free return\" or \"NFFR\" - allowing the owner to have a free breeding to their stallion the next year. However, this is not offered for every breeding.\n\n== Covering the mare ==\n[[File:K\u00fcnstliche Vagina.jpg|roght|thumb|200px|An [[artificial vagina]], used to collect semen]]\nThere are two general ways to \"cover\" or breed the mare:\n* '''Live cover''': the mare is brought to the stallion's residence and is covered \"live\" in the breeding shed. She may also be turned out in a pasture with the stallion for several days to breed naturally ('pasture bred'). The former situation is often preferred, as it provides a more controlled environment, allowing the breeder to ensure that the mare was covered, and places the handlers in a position to remove the horses from one another should one attempt to kick or bite the other.\n* '''[[Artificial Insemination]] (AI)''': the mare is inseminated by a veterinarian or an equine reproduction manager, using either fresh, cooled or frozen semen.\n\nAfter the mare is bred or artificially inseminated, she is checked using [[ultrasound]] 14\u201316 days later to see if she \"took\", and is pregnant. A second check is usually performed at 28 days. If the mare is not pregnant, she may be bred again during her next cycle.\n\nIt is considered safe to breed a mare to a stallion of much larger size.  Because of the mare's type of placenta and its attachment and blood supply, the foal will be limited in its growth within the uterus to the size of the mare's uterus, but will grow to its genetic potential after it is born. Test breedings have been done with [[draft horse]] stallions bred to small mares with no increase in the number of difficult births.<ref>Stanford, Dr. David, Woodside Equine Clinic, Ashland, VA</ref>\n\n=== Live cover ===\n\nWhen breeding live cover, the mare is usually boarded at the stud. She may be \"teased\" several times with a stallion that will not breed to her, usually with the stallion being presented to the mare over a barrier. Her reaction to the [[teaser (animal)|teaser]], whether hostile or passive, is noted. A mare that is in heat will generally tolerate a teaser (although this is not always the case), and may present herself to him, holding her tail to the side. A veterinarian may also determine if the mare is ready to be bred, by ultrasound or palpating daily to determine if ovulation has occurred. Live cover can also be done in liberty on a paddock or on pasture, although due to safety and efficacy concerns, it is not common at professional breeding farms.\n\nWhen it has been determined that the mare is ready, both the mare and intended stud will be cleaned. The mare will then be presented to the stallion, usually with one handler controlling the mare and one or more handlers in charge of the stallion. Multiple handlers are preferred, as the mare and stallion can be easily separated should there be any trouble.\n\n[[The Jockey Club]], the organization that oversees the [[Thoroughbred]] industry in the United States, requires all registered foals to be bred through live cover.  Artificial insemination, listed below, is not permitted.<ref name=\"Thoroughbred Rules for Registration\">Section V, Rule 1, Part D, [http://www.jockeyclub.com/registry.asp?section=3#one ''The American Stud Book Principal Rules and Requirements.''] ''[[The Jockey Club]]'', 2011. Accessed 2011-02-15.</ref> Similar rules apply in other countries.<ref>See Rule AR.15C, ''Australian Rules of Racing'', which explicitly prohibits human manipulation of the breeding process.</ref>\n\nBy contrast, the U.S. [[standardbred horse|standardbred]] industry allows registered foals to be bred by live cover, or by artificial insemination (AI) with fresh or frozen (not dried) semen. No other artificial fertility treatment is allowed. In addition, foals bred via AI of frozen semen may only be registered if the stallion's sperm was collected during his lifetime, and used no later than the calendar year of his death or castration.<ref name=\"Standardbred AI\">Rule 26, Section 6, [http://www.ustrotting.com/pdf/USTARuleBook.pdf  ''Rules and Regulations of the United States Trotting Association 2009.''] ''[[United States Trotting Association]]'', 2009. Accessed 2011-02-15.</ref>\n\n=== Artificial insemination ===\n\n[[Artificial insemination]] (AI) has several advantages over live cover, and has a very similar conception rate:\n* The mare and stallion never have to come in contact with each other, which therefore reduces breeding accidents, such as the mare kicking the stallion.\n* AI opens up the world to international breeding, as semen may be shipped across continents to mares that would otherwise be unable to breed to a particular stallion.\n* A mare also does not have to travel to the stallion, so the process is less stressful on her, and if she already has a foal, the foal does not have to travel.\n* AI allows more mares to be bred from one stallion, as the ejaculate may be split between mares.\n* AI reduces the chance of spreading sexually transmitted diseases between mare and stallion.\n* AI allows mares or stallions with health issues, such as sore hocks which may prevent a stallion from mounting, to continue to breed.\n* Frozen semen may be stored and used to breed mares even after the stallion is dead, allowing his lines to continue. However, the semen of some stallions does not freeze well. Some breed registries may not permit the registration of foals resulting from the use of frozen semen after the stallion's death, although other large registries accept such usage and provide registrations.  The overall trend is toward permitting use of frozen semen after the death of the stallion.\n\nA stallion is usually trained to mount a phantom (or dummy) mare, although a live mare may be used, and he is most commonly collected using an [[artificial vagina]] (AV) which is heated to simulate the vagina of the mare. The AV has a filter and collection area at one end to capture the semen, which can then be processed in a lab. The semen may be chilled or frozen and shipped to the mare owner or used to breed mares \"on-farm\". When the mare is in heat, the person inseminating introduces the semen directly into her uterus using a syringe and pipette.\n\n=== Advanced reproductive techniques ===\n[[File:Andrew Thornton.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The [[Thoroughbred]] industry does not allow AI or embryo transplant.]]\n\nOften an owner does not want to take a valuable competition mare out of training to carry a foal. This presents a problem, as the mare will usually be quite old by the time she is retired from her competitive career, at which time it is more difficult to impregnate her. Other times, a mare may have physical problems that prevent or discourage breeding. However, there are now several options for breeding these mares. These options also allow a mare to produce multiple foals each breeding season, instead of the usual one. Therefore, mares may have an even greater value for breeding.\n* '''[[Embryo transfer|Embryo Transfer]]''': This relatively new method involves flushing out the mare's fertilized embryo a few days following insemination, and transferring to a surrogate mare, which has been synchronized to be in the same phase of the estrous cycle as the donor mare.<ref>[http://www.aaep.org/health_articles_view.php?id=143 \"Embryo Transfer\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415220448/http://www.aaep.org/health_articles_view.php?id=143 |date=2008-04-15 }}</ref>\n* '''Gamete Intrafallopian Transfer (GIFT)''': The mare's ovum and the stallion's sperm are deposited in the oviduct of a surrogate dam. This technique is very useful for subfertile stallions, as fewer sperm are needed, so a stallion with a low sperm count can still successfully breed.\n* '''Egg Transfer''': An [[oocyte]] is removed from the mare's follicle and transferred into the oviduct of the recipient mare, who is then bred. This is best for mares with physical problems, such as an obstructed oviduct, that prevent breeding.\n* '''Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI)''': Used in horses due to lack of successful co-incubation of female and male gametes in simple IVF. A plug of the zona pellucida is removed and a single sperm cell is injected into the ooplasm of the mature oocyte. An advantage of ICSI over IVF is that lower quality sperm can be used since the sperm does not have to penetrate the zona pellucida. The success rate of ICSI is 23-44% blastocyst development.<ref>Galli, Cesare, Roberto Duchi, Silvia Colleoni, Irina Lagutina, Giovanna Lazzari.

The term \"''heterosexual''\" was first published in 1892 in [[Charles Gilbert Chaddock|C.G. Chaddock's]] translation of [[Richard von Krafft-Ebing|Krafft-Ebing's]] \"[[Psychopathia Sexualis (book)#Psychopathia Sexualis|Psychopathia Sexualis]]\". The noun came into use from the early 1920s, but did not enter common use until the 1960s. The colloquial shortening \"hetero\" is attested from 1933. The abstract noun \"heterosexuality\" is first recorded in 1900.<ref>p.22, Mills</ref> The word ''\"heterosexual\"'' was first listed in Merriam-Webster's ''New International Dictionary'' as a [[Medical terminology|medical term]] for \"morbid sexual passion for one of the opposite sex\"; however, in 1934 in their ''Second Edition Unabridged'' it is defined as a \"manifestation of sexual passion for one of the opposite sex; normal sexuality\".<ref>(p.&nbsp;92, Katz)</ref>\nThe adjective ''heterosexual'' is used for [[intimate relationship]]s or [[human sexual behavior|sexual relations]] between male and female.\n\n=== Terminology ===\n\nThe current use of the term ''heterosexual'' has its roots in the broader 19th century tradition of personality taxonomy. It continues to influence the development of the modern concept of sexual orientation, and can be used to describe individuals' sexual orientation, sexual history, or self-identification. Some reject the term ''heterosexual'', as they feel that the word only refers to one's sexual behavior and does not refer to non-sexual romantic feelings. The term ''heterosexual'' is suggested to have come into use as a [[neologism]] after, and opposite to, the word ''homosexual'' by [[Karl Maria Kertbeny]] in 1868. In [[LGBT]] slang, the term ''[[Breeder (slang)|breeder]]'' has been used as a denigrating phrase to deride heterosexuals. Hyponyms of heterosexual include ''heteroflexible''.<ref>Porn.com: Making Sense of Online Pornography - Page 229, Feona Attwood - 2010</ref><ref>Patience: A Gay Man's Virtue - Page 80, La Lumiere - 2012</ref>\n\nThe word can be informally<ref>\"hetero.\" Dictionary.com Unabridged.

One of the first uses of the word in this way was in 1941 by author G. W. Henry.<ref name=Henry>Henry, G. W. (1941). ''Sex Variants: A Study of Homosexual Patterns''. New York: Paul B. Hoeber</ref> Henry's book concerned conversations with homosexual males and used this term in connection with people who are identified as [[ex-gay]]s. It is now simply a colloquial term for \"heterosexual\", having changed in primary meaning over time. Some object to usage of the term ''straight'' because it implies that non-heteros are crooked.<ref>Encyclopedia Of School Psychology - Page 298, T. Steuart Watson, Christopher H. Skinner - 2004</ref>\n\n== Symbolism ==\n[[File:HeteroSym-pinkblue.svg|140px|thumb|upright|One version of a heterosexuality symbol]]\n\nHeterosexual symbolism dates back to the earliest artifacts of humanity, with [[gender symbols]], ritual fertility carvings, and primitive art. This was later expressed in the symbolism of [[fertility rites]] and [[Polytheism#Historical polytheism|polytheistic worship]], which often included images of human [[Sex organ|reproductive organs]], such as [[lingam]] in [[Hinduism]]. Modern symbols of heterosexuality in societies derived from European traditions still reference symbols used in these ancient beliefs. One such image is a combination of the symbol for [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], the Roman god of war, as the definitive [[male]] symbol of masculinity, and [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], the Roman goddess of love and beauty, as the definitive [[female]] symbol of femininity. The [[unicode]] character for this combined symbol is \u26a4 (U+26A4).\n\n== History==\n{{Main|History of human sexuality}}\n[[File:52-aspetti di vita quotidiana, amore,Taccuino Sanitatis, Cas.jpg|thumb|240px|Illustration from ''[[Tacuinum Sanitatis]]'', a medieval handbook on wellness.]]\n\n== Religious aspects ==\n{{See also|Religion and sexuality}}\n{{multiple image\n| align = vertical\n|width1=186\n|image1=Peter Paul Rubens 004.jpg\n|caption1= [[Abrahamic religion]]s believe [[Adam and Eve]] as the first human heterosexual couple and the predecessor of the humanity.\n|width2=240\n|image2=Jatalinga sur cuve \u00e0 ablution (mus\u00e9e Guimet) (5153565239).jpg\n|caption2= In Hinduism, [[lingam|Shivalingam]] (penis of [[Shiva]]) and [[Yoni]] (womb of [[Shakti]]) is often worshipped as a heterosexual symbol of divine power. \n}}\nThe [[Judeo-Christian]] tradition has several scriptures related to heterosexuality.

One widely reported early estimate was 10% (e.g., Marmor, 1980; Voeller, 1990). Some recent data provided support for this estimate (Bagley and Tremblay, 1998), but most recent large national samples suggest that the prevalence of male homosexuality in modern western societies, including the United States, is lower than this early estimate (e.g., 1\u20132% in Billy et al., 1993; 2\u20133% in Laumann et al., 1994; 6% in Sell et al., 1995; 1\u20133% in Wellings et al., 1994). It is of note, however, that homosexuality is defined in different ways in these studies. For example, some use same-sex behavior and not same-sex attraction as the operational definition of homosexuality (e.g., Billy et al., 1993); many sex researchers (e.g., Bailey et al., 2000; Bogaert, 2003; Money, 1988; Zucker and Bradley, 1995) now emphasize attraction over overt behavior in conceptualizing sexual orientation.\" (p. 33) Also: \"...the prevalence of male homosexuality (in particular, same-sex attraction) varies over time and across societies (and hence is a \"moving target\") in part because of two effects: (1) variations in fertility rate or family size; and (2) the fraternal birth order effect.

Quantitative studies by [[Alfred Kinsey]] in the 1940s and [[Fritz Klein (sex researcher)|Dr. Fritz Klein]]'s sexual orientation grid in the 1980s find distributions similar to those postulated by their predecessors.\n\nAccording to ''Sexual Behavior in the Human Male'' by Alfred Kinsey and several other modern studies, the majority of humans have had both heterosexual and homosexual experiences or sensations and are bisexual. Kinsey himself, along with current sex therapists, focused on the historicity and fluidity of sexual orientation. Kinsey's studies consistently found sexual orientation to be something that evolves in many directions over a person's lifetime; rarely, but not necessarily, including forming attractions to a new sex. Rarely do individuals radically reorient their sexualities rapidly\u2014and still less do they do so volitionally\u2014but often sexualities expand, shift, and absorb new elements over decades. For example, socially normative \"age-appropriate\" sexuality requires a shifting object of attraction (especially in the passage through adolescence). Contemporary [[queer theory]], incorporating many ideas from [[social constructionism]], tends to look at sexuality as something that has meaning only within a given historical framework. Sexuality, then, is seen as a participation in a larger social discourse and, though in some sense fluid, not as something strictly determinable by the individual.\n\nOther studies have disputed Kinsey's methodology. \"His figures were undermined when it was revealed that he had disproportionately interviewed homosexuals and prisoners (many sex offenders).\"<ref>Tom Bethell (April 2005). \"Kinsey as Pervert\".</cite> ''American Spectator'', '''38''', 42\u201344. {{ISSN|0148-8414}}.</ref><ref>Julia A.

Revisiting Kinsey's methodology\".</cite> ''The Journal of Sex Research'' '''35''' (2): 132-40, {{ISSN|0022-4499}}.</ref>\n\nSexologists have attributed discrepancies in some findings to negative societal attitudes towards a particular sexual orientation. For example, people may state different sexual orientations depending on whether their immediate social environment is public or private. Reluctance to disclose one's actual sexual orientation is often referred to as \"being in the closet.\" Individuals capable of enjoyable sexual relations with both sexes or one sex may feel inclined to restrict themselves to heterosexual or homosexual relations in societies that stigmatize same-sex or opposite-sex relations.\n\n=== Nature and nurture ===\n\nThe considerable \"[[nature and nurture]]\" debate exists over whether predominantly biological or psychological factors produce sexual orientation in humans, or whether both significantly factor into sexual orientation. Candidate factors include [[Biology and sexual orientation#Empirical studies|genes]], the exposure of fetuses to certain [[Biology and sexual orientation#Early fixation hypothesis|hormones]] (or lack thereof) and [[Environment and sexual orientation|environmental factors]].\n\n=== Critique of studies ===\n\nThe studies performed in order to find the origin of sexual orientation have been criticized for being too limited in scope, mostly for focusing only on heterosexuality and homosexuality as two diametrically opposite poles with no orientation in between. It is also asserted that scientific studies focus too much on the search for a biological explanation for sexual orientation, and not enough on the combined effects of both biology and psychology.<ref name=CFRG/>\n\nIn a brief by the [[Council for Responsible Genetics]],<ref name=CFRG/> it was stated that sexual orientation is not fixed either way, and on the discourse over sexual orientation: \"Noticeably missing from this debate is the notion, championed by Kinsey, that human sexual expression is as variable among people as many other [[complex traits]]. Yet just like intelligence, sexuality is a complex human feature that modern science is attempting to explain with genetics. Research on brain size, hormone levels, finger length, and other biological traits have yet to yield evidence for this, however. It is important to note that traits such as these result from a combination of gene expression and developmental and other environmental factors. Well-known biologist and social theorist, Anne Fausto-Sterling advocates in her book Sexing the Body, for what scientists term a \u201csystems approach\u201d to be applied to our understanding of sexual preference. Rather than determining that this results from purely biological processes, a trait evolves from developmental processes that include both biological and social elements.\"<ref name=CFRG>{{cite web | url=http://www.councilforresponsiblegenetics.org/ViewPage.aspx?pageId=66 | title=Brief on Sexual Orientation and Genetic Determinism | publisher=[[Council for Responsible Genetics]] website | date=May 2006 | accessdate=24 January 2016}}</ref> According to the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA), there are numerous theories about the origins of a person's sexual orientation, but some believe that \"sexual orientation is most likely the result of a complex interaction of environmental, cognitive and biological factors,\" and that genetic factors play a \"significant role\" in determining a person's sexuality.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.jmu.edu/safezone/wm_library/Sexual%20Orientation%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf | title=Fact and Information Sheet About: Sexual Orientation: Taken from \"Answers to Your Questions About Sexual Orientation and Homosexuality\" by the American Psychological Association. | publisher=[[James Madison University]] | work=Office of Public Affairs, [[American Psychological Association]] | accessdate=24 January 2016 | page=4}}</ref>\n\n===Sexual fluidity===\n{{Main|Sexual orientation identity|Sexual fluidity}}\nOften, sexual orientation and [[sexual orientation identity]] are not distinguished, which can impact accurately assessing sexual identity and whether or not sexual orientation is able to change; sexual orientation identity can change throughout an individual's life, and may or may not align with biological sex, sexual behavior or actual sexual orientation.<ref name=\"Sinclair\">Sinclair, Karen, About Whoever: The Social Imprint on Identity and Orientation, NY, 2013 {{ISBN|9780981450513}}</ref><ref name=\"Rosario et al.\">{{cite journal | last1 = Rosario | first1 = M. | last2 = Schrimshaw | first2 = E. | last3 = Hunter | first3 = J. |last4 = Braun | first4 = L. | year = 2006 | title = Sexual identity development among lesbian, gay, and bisexual youths: Consistency and change over time | url = | journal = Journal of Sex Research | volume = 43 | issue = 1| pages = 46\u201358 | doi=10.1080/00224490609552298| pmc = 3215279 | pmid=16817067}}</ref><ref name=\"Concordance/discordance in SO\">{{cite journal|first=Michael W.|last=Ross|author2=Essien, E.

In \u201cThe Invention of Heterosexuality,\u201d Jonathon Ned Katz dates the definition of heterosexuality, as it is used today, to the late 19th century.<ref name=\"Katz\">{{cite journal|last1=Katz|first1=Jonathon Ned|title=The Invention of Heterosexuality|journal=Socialist Review|date=January\u2013March 1990|issue=20|pages=7\u201334|url=https://english101sp2015.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/jonathan-katz_the-invention-of-heterosexuality.pdf|accessdate=5 December 2016}}</ref> In the [[Victorian era]], sex was seen as a means to achieve reproduction, relations between the sexes were not believed to be overtly sexual. The body was thought of as a tool for procreation, \u201chuman energy, though of as a closed and severely limited system, was to be used in producing children and in work, not wasted in libidinous pleasures.\u201d<ref name=\"Katz\"/> Modern ideas of [[sexuality]] and [[eroticism]] began to develop in America and Germany in the later 19th century. The changing economy and the \u201ctransformation of the family from producer to consumer\u201d<ref name=\"Katz\"/> resulted in shifting values. The Victorian work ethic had changed, pleasure became more highly valued and this allowed ideas of human sexuality to change. [[Consumer culture]] had created a market for the erotic, pleasure became [[commoditized]]. At the same time medical doctors began to acquire more power and influence. They developed the medical model of Normal Love in which healthy men and women enjoyed sex as part of a \u201cnew ideal of male-female relationships that included.. an essential, necessary, normal eroticism.\u201d <ref name=\"Katz\"/> This \u2018Normal Sexual\u2019 ideal also had a counterpart, the Victorian Sex Pervert, anyone who failed to meet the [[Norm (social)|norm]]. The basic oppositeness of the sexes was the basis for normal, healthy sexual attraction. \u201cThe attention paid the sexual abnormal created a need to name the sexual normal, the better to distinguish the average him and her from the deviant it.\u201d <ref name=\"Katz\"/> The creation term \u2018heterosexual\u2019 consolidated the social existence of the pre-existing heterosexual experience and created a sense of ensured and validated normalcy within it.\n\n== Heteronormativity and heterosexism ==\n{{See also|Sexual orientation change efforts|Ex-gay movement|Heterosexuals Organized for a Moral Environment|National Association for Research & Therapy of Homosexuality}}\n[[File:Man-and-woman-icon.svg|thumb|upright|right|This image often used on Straight Pride T-shirts]]\n\n[[Heteronormativity]] denotes or relates to a world view that promotes heterosexuality as the normal or preferred sexual orientation for people to have.

The tower is the first circular skyscraper in Hong Kong. It is named after Hong Kong-listed property firm [[Hopewell Holdings|Hopewell Holdings Limited]], which constructed the building. Hopewell Holdings Limited's headquarters are in the building and its Chief executive officer, [[Gordon Wu]], has his office on the top floor.\n\n==Description==\nConstruction started in 1977 and was completed in 1980. Upon completion, Hopewell Centre surpassed [[Jardine House]] as Hong Kong's tallest building. It was also the second tallest building in Asia at the time. It kept its title in Hong Kong until 1989, when the [[Bank of China Tower, Hong Kong|Bank of China Tower]] was completed. The building is now the 20th tallest building in Hong Kong.\n\nThe building has a circular floor plan. Although the front entrance is on the 'ground floor', commuters are taken through a set of escalators to the 3rd floor lift lobby. Hopewell Centre stands on the slope of a hill so steep that the building has its back entrance on the 17th floor towards [[Kennedy Road, Hong Kong|Kennedy Road]]. There is a circular private swimming pool on the roof of the building built for [[feng shui]] reasons.<ref>https://www.scmp.com/magazines/hk-magazine/article/2037278/whats-history-hopewell-centre</ref>\n\nA [[revolving restaurant]] located on the 62nd floor, called \"Revolving 66\", overlooks other tall buildings below and [[Victoria Harbour|the harbour]]. It was originally called Revolving 62, but soon changed its name as locals kept calling it Revolving 66. It completes a 360-degree rotation each hour. Passengers take either office lifts (faster) or the scenic lifts (with a view) to the 56/F, where they transfer to smaller lifts up to the 62/F. The restaurant is now named The Grand Buffet.\n\nThe building comprises several groups of lifts. Lobbies are on the 3rd and 17th floor, and are connected to Queen's Road East and Kennedy Road respectively. A mini-skylobby is on the 56th floor and serves as a transfer floor for diners heading to the 60/F and 62/F restaurants. The building's white 'bumps' between the windows have built in window-washer guide rails.\n\nThis skyscraper was the filming location for R&B group [[Dru Hill]]'s music video for \"How Deep Is Your Love,\" directed by [[Brett Ratner]], who also directed the movie [[Rush Hour (1998 film)|Rush Hour]], whose soundtrack features the song.

The town was officially incorporated in 1694, and originally included the lands of the current town of [[Brewster, Massachusetts|Brewster]]. Early industry involved fishing and farming. The town is considered by some to be the birthplace of the [[cranberry]] industry, with the first commercial operation opened in 1846. There are still many bogs in the town, although the economy is now more centered on tourism and as a residential community. The town is also the site of the start/finish line of the \"Sail Around the Cape\", which rounds the Cape counter-clockwise, returning via the [[Cape Cod Canal]].<ref>''Cape Cod, Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket Street Atlas.''

The system is analogous to the [[pennant number]] system that the [[Royal Navy]] and other European and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] navies use.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== United States Navy ===\nThe U.S. Navy began to assign unique [[Naval Registry Identification Number]]s to its ships in the 1890s. The system was a simple one in which each ship received a number which was appended to its ship type, fully spelled out, and added parenthetically after the ship's name when deemed necessary to avoid confusion between ships. Under this system, for example, the [[battleship]] [[USS Indiana (BB-1)|''Indiana'']] was USS ''Indiana'' (Battleship No. 1), the [[cruiser]] [[USS Olympia (C-6)|''Olympia'']] was USS ''Olympia'' (Cruiser No. 6), and so on. Beginning in 1907, some ships also were referred to alternatively by single-letter or three-letter codes\u2014for example, USS ''Indiana'' (Battleship No. 1) could be referred to as USS ''Indiana'' (B-1) and USS ''Olympia'' (Cruiser No. 6) could also be referred to as USS ''Olympia'' (C-6), while USS ''Pennsylvania'' (Armored Cruiser No. 4) could be referred to as USS ''Pennsylvania'' (ACR-4). However, rather than replacing it, these codes coexisted and were used interchangeably with the older system until the modern system was instituted on 17 July 1920.\n\nDuring [[World War I]], the U.S. Navy acquired large numbers of privately owned and commercial ships and craft for use as [[patrol vessel]]s, [[Minelayer|mine warfare vessels]],  and various types of naval [[auxiliary ship]]s, some of them with identical names. To keep track of them all, the Navy assigned unique identifying numbers to them. Those deemed appropriate for patrol work received [[section patrol]] numbers (SP), while those intended for other purposes received \"identification numbers\", generally abbreviated \"Id. No.\" or \"ID;\" some ships and craft changed from an SP to an ID number or vice versa during their careers, without their unique numbers themselves changing, and some ships and craft assigned numbers in anticipation of naval service never were acquired by the Navy. The SP/ID numbering sequence was unified and continuous, with no SP number repeated in the ID series or vice versa so that there could not be, for example, both an \"SP-435\" and an \"Id. No 435\". The SP and ID numbers were used parenthetically after each boat's or ship's name to identify it; although this system pre-dated the modern hull classification system and its numbers were not referred to at the time as \"hull codes\" or \"hull numbers,\" it was used in a similar manner to today's system and can be considered its precursor.<ref>Naval History and heritage Command Online Library of Selected Images (at http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/shusn-no/spid-no.htm).</ref>\n\n=== United States Revenue Cutter Service and United States Coast Guard ===\nThe [[United States Revenue Cutter Service]], which merged with the [[United States Lifesaving Service]] in January 1915 to form the modern [[United States Coast Guard]], began following the Navy's lead in the 1890s, with its [[United States Coast Guard Cutter|cutters]] having parenthetical numbers called [[Naval Registry Identification Number]]s following their names, such as (Cutter No. 1), etc.  This persisted until the Navy's modern hull classification system's introduction in 1920, which included Coast Guard ships and craft.\n\n=== United States Coast and Geodetic Survey ===\n\nLike the U.S. Navy, the [[United States Coast and Geodetic Survey]] \u2013 a uniformed seagoing service of the [[United States Government]] and a predecessor of the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) \u2013 adopted a hull number system for its fleet in the 20th century. Its largest vessels, \"Category I\" [[Oceanography|oceanographic]] [[survey ship]]s, were classified as \"ocean survey ships\" and given the designation \"OSS\". Intermediate-sized \"Category II\" oceanographic survey ships received the designation \"MSS\" for \"medium survey ship,\" and smaller \"Category III\" oceanographic survey ships were given the classification \"CSS\" for \"coastal survey ship.\" A fourth designation, \"ASV\" for \"auxiliary survey vessel,\" included even smaller vessels. In each case, a particular ship received a unique designation based on its classification and a unique hull number separated by a space rather than a hyphen; for example, the third Coast and Geodetic Survey ship named ''Pioneer'' was an ocean survey ship officially known as [[USC&GS Pioneer (OSS 31)|USC&GS ''Pioneer'' (OSS 31)]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=uYSPAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA3612&lpg=PA3612&dq=Ocean+Survey+Ship+(OSS)+MSS+CSS&source=bl&ots=q0Iq2sEN7a&sig=HN4i6XsnjYb3s8LOLXrPMbSaIUg&hl=en&sa=X&ei=3nBpU8XXFdHboASC64DoAg&ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Ocean%20Survey%20Ship%20(OSS)%20MSS%20CSS&f=false United States Department of State, ''United States Treaties and Other International Obligations, Volume 23, Part Four'', Washington, D.C.:U.S. Government Printing Office, 1972, p. 3612.]</ref><ref>[http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/cgs/011_pdf/CSC-0205.pdf United States Department of Commerce, ''Annual Report of the Director of the Coast and Geodetic Survey for the Fiscal Year Ending June 30, 1964'', U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C.: 1964, pp. 3\u20135.]</ref> The Coast and Geodetic Survey{{'}}s system persisted after the creation of NOAA in 1970, when NOAA took control of the Survey{{'}}s fleet, but NOAA later changed to its modern hull classification system.\n\n== The modern hull classification system ==\n\n=== United States Navy ===\n\nThe U.S. Navy instituted its modern hull classification system on 17 July 1920, doing away with section patrol numbers, \"identification numbers\", and the other numbering systems described above.  In the new system, all hull classification symbols are at least two letters; for basic types the symbol is the first letter of the type name, doubled, except for aircraft carriers.\n\nThe combination of symbol and hull number identifies a modern Navy ship uniquely. A heavily modified or re-purposed ship may receive a new symbol, and either retain the hull number or receive a new one. For example, the heavy gun cruiser {{USS|Boston|CA-69}} was converted to a gun/missile cruiser, changing the hull number to CAG-1. Also, the system of symbols has changed a number of times both since it was introduced in 1907 and since the modern system was instituted in 1920, so ships' symbols sometimes change without anything being done to the physical ship.<ref>Derdall and DiGiulian, (section: ''Nomenclature history'')</ref>\n\nHull numbers are assigned by classification. Duplication between, but not within, classifications is permitted. Hence, CV-1 was the [[aircraft carrier]] {{USS|Langley|CV-1|6}} and BB-1 was the battleship {{USS|Indiana|BB-1|6}}.\n\nShip types and classifications have come and gone over the years, and many of the symbols listed below are not presently in use. The [[Naval Vessel Register]] maintains an online database of U.S. Navy ships showing which symbols are presently in use.\n\nAfter [[World War II]] until 1975, the U.S. Navy defined a \"[[frigate]]\" as a type of surface warship larger than a [[destroyer]] and smaller than a cruiser.  In other navies, such a ship generally was referred to as a \"[[flotilla leader]]\", or \"destroyer leader\".  Hence the U.S. Navy's use of \"DL\" for \"frigate\" prior to 1975, while \"frigates\" in other navies were smaller than destroyers and more like what the U.S. Navy termed a \"[[destroyer escort]]\", \"[[ocean escort]]\", or \"DE\".  The [[United States Navy 1975 ship reclassification]] of [[cruiser]]s, frigates, and ocean escorts brought U.S. Navy classifications into line with other nations' classifications, at least cosmetically in terms of terminology, and eliminated the perceived [[United States Navy 1975 ship reclassification#The \"cruiser gap\"|\"cruiser gap\"]] with the [[Soviet Navy]] by redesignating the former \"frigates\" as \"cruisers\".\n\n==== Military Sealift Command ====\nIf a U.S. Navy ship's hull classification symbol begins with \"T-\", it is part of the [[Military Sealift Command]], has a primarily civilian crew, and is a [[United States Naval Ship]] (USNS) in non-commissioned service \u2013 as opposed to a [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] [[United States Ship]] (USS) with an all-military crew.\n\n=== United States Coast Guard ===\nIf a ship's hull classification symbol begins with \"W\", it is a ship of the [[United States Coast Guard]].  Until 1965, the Coast Guard used U.S. Navy hull classification codes, prepending a \"W\" to their beginning.  In 1965, it retired some of the less mission-appropriate Navy-based classifications and developed new ones of its own, most notably WHEC for \"[[high endurance cutter]]\" and WMEC for \"[[medium endurance cutter]]\".\n\n=== National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ===\nThe [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA), a component of the [[United States Department of Commerce]], includes the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Commissioned Officer Corps]] (or \"NOAA Corps\"), one of the seven [[uniformed services of the United States]], and operates a fleet of seagoing research and survey ships. The [[NOAA ships and aircraft|NOAA fleet]] also uses a hull classification symbol system, which it also calls \"hull numbers,\" for its ships.\n\nAfter NOAA took over the former Coast and Geodetic Survey fleet in 1970 along with research vessels of other government agencies, it adopted a new system of ship classification. In its system, the NOAA fleet is divided into two broad categories, [[research ship]]s and [[survey ship]]s.  The research ships, which include [[Oceanography|oceanographic]] and [[Fishery|fisheries]] research vessels, are given hull numbers beginning with \"R\", while the survey ships, generally [[hydrography|hydrographic]] survey vessels, receive hull numbers beginning with \"S\". The letter is followed by a three-digit number; the first digit indicates the NOAA \"class\" (i.e., size) of the vessel, which NOAA assigns based on the ship's [[gross ton]]nage and [[horsepower]], while the next two digits combine with the first digit to create a unique three-digit identifying number for the ship.\n\nGenerally, each NOAA hull number is written with a space between the letter and the three-digit number, as in, for example, {{ship|NOAAS|Nancy Foster|R 352}} or {{ship|NOAAS|Thomas Jefferson|S 222}}.<ref>Wertheim, ''The Naval Institute Guide to Combat Fleets of the World, 15th Edition: Their Ships, Aircraft, and Systems'', p. 1005.</ref>\n\nUnlike the Navy, once an older NOAA ship leaves service, a newer one can be given the same hull number; for example, \"S 222\" was assigned to {{ship|NOAAS|Mount Mitchell|S 222}}, then assigned to NOAAS ''Thomas Jefferson'' (S 222), which entered NOAA service after ''Mount Mitchell'' was stricken.\n\n== United States Navy hull classification codes ==\n\nThe U.S. Navy's system of alpha-numeric ship designators, and its associated hull numbers, have been for several decades a unique method of categorizing ships of all types: combatants, auxiliaries and district craft. Though considerably changed in detail and expanded over the years, this system remains essentially the same as when formally implemented in 1920. It is a very useful tool for organizing and keeping track of naval vessels, and also provides the basis for the identification numbers painted on the bows (and frequently the sterns) of most U.S. Navy ships.\n\nThe ship designator and hull number system's roots extend back to the late 1880s, when ship type serial numbers were assigned to most of the new-construction warships of the emerging \"Steel Navy\". During the course of the next thirty years, these same numbers were combined with filing codes used by the Navy's clerks to create an informal version of the system that was put in place in 1920. Limited usage of ship numbers goes back even earlier, most notably to the \"Jeffersonian Gunboats\" of the early 1800s and the \"Tinclad\" river gunboats of the Civil War Mississippi Squadron.\n\nIt is important to understand that hull number letter prefixes are not acronyms, and should not be carelessly treated as abbreviations of ship type classifications. Thus, \"DD\" does not stand for anything more than \"Destroyer\". \"SS\" simply means \"Submarine\". And \"FF\" is the post-1975 type code for \"Frigate.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=U.S. Navy Ships \u2013 Listed by Hull Number|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/shusn-no/usnsh-no.htm|publisher=Naval History and Heritage Command}}</ref>\n\nThe hull classification codes for ships in active duty in the United States Navy are governed under Secretary of the Navy Instruction 5030.8B [http://www.nvr.navy.mil/5030.8B.pdf (SECNAVINST 5030.8B).]\n\n=== Warships ===\nWarships are designed to participate in combat operations.\n\nThe origin of the 2 letter code derives from the need to distinguish various cruiser subtypes.<ref>Derdall and DiGiulian, (section: ''Cruisers'')</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|align=\"center\" rowspan=\"5\" | Cruiser\n| armored (1921\u20131931)<br>heavy (1931\u2013)\n!

Contrary to popular belief, the \"CV\" hull classification symbol does not stand for \"carrier vessel\". \"CV\" derives from the cruiser designation, with the v for French ''voler'', \"to fly\"{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}. Aircraft carriers are designated in two sequences: the first sequence runs from CV-1 USS ''[[USS Langley (CV-1)|Langley]]'' to the very latest ships, and the second sequence, \"CVE\" for escort carriers, ran from CVE-1 [[USS Long Island (CVE-1)|''Long Island'']] to CVE-127 [[USS Okinawa (CVE-127)|''Okinawa'']] before being discontinued.\n* AV: [[Seaplane tender|Seaplane Tender]] (retired)\n* AVG: [[Auxiliary Aircraft Ferry]] ([[Escort carrier]]) (1941\u201342)\n* AVD: [[Seaplane Tender Destroyer]] (retired)\n* AVP: [[Seaplane Tender]], Small (retired)\n* AVT (i) Auxiliary Aircraft Transport (retired)\n* AVT (ii) Auxiliary Training Carrier (retired)\n* ACV: [[Auxiliary Aircraft Carrier]] (Escort carrier) (1942)\n* CV: [[Fleet aircraft carrier]] (1921\u20131975), multi-purpose [[aircraft carrier]] (1975\u2013present)\n* CVA: Aircraft Carrier, Attack (category merged into CV, 30 June 1975)\n* CV(N): Aircraft Carrier, Night (Deck equipped with lighting and pilots trained and for nighttime fights) (1944) (retired)\n* CVAN: Aircraft Carrier, Attack, Nuclear-powered (category merged into CVN, 30 June 1975)\n* CVB: Aircraft Carrier, Large (Original USS ''Midway'' class, category merged into CVA, 1952)\n* CVE: [[Escort aircraft carrier]] (retired) (1943\u2013retirement of type)\n* CVHA: Aircraft Carrier, Helicopter Assault (retired in favor of several LH-series [[amphibious assault ship]] hull codes)\n* CVHE: Aircraft Carrier, Helicopter, Escort (retired)\n* CVL: [[Light aircraft carrier]] or Aircraft Carrier, Small (retired) <ref>[https://www.history.navy.mil/content/dam/nhhc/research/histories/naval-aviation/Naval%20Aviation%20News/1940/pdf/1aug43.pdf Bureau of Aeronautics, Navy Department.\"New Carrier Designations\".

The primary surface combatants are battleships, cruisers and destroyers.  Battleships are very heavily armed and armored; cruisers moderately so; destroyers and smaller warships, less so.  Before 1920, ships were called \"<type> no. X\", with the type fully pronounced.  The types were commonly abbreviated in ship lists to \"B-X\", \"C-X\", \"D-X\" et cetera\u2014for example, before 1920, {{USS|Minnesota|BB-22}} would have been called \"USS ''Minnesota'', Battleship number&nbsp;22\" orally and \"USS ''Minnesota'', B-22\" in writing.

Such designations usually occur during periods of sudden mobilization, such as that which occurred prior to, and during, [[World War II]] or the [[Korean War]], when it was determined that a sudden temporary need arose for a ship for which there was no official Navy designation.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], for example, a number of commercial vessels were requisitioned, or acquired, by the U.S. Navy to meet the sudden requirements of war. A [[yacht]] acquired by the U.S. Navy during the start of World War II might seem desirable to the Navy whose use for the vessel might not be fully developed or explored at the time of acquisition.\n\nOn the other hand, a U.S. Navy vessel, such as the yacht in the example above, already in commission or service, might be desired, or found useful, for another need or purpose for which there is no official designation.\n* IX: Unclassified Miscellaneous Auxiliary Ship, for example yacht ''Chanco'' acquired by the U.S. Navy on 1 October 1940. It was classified as a [[Minesweeper (ship)|minesweeper]] {{USS|Kestrel|AMc-5|1}}, but instead, mainly used as a [[patrol craft]] along the [[New England]] coast. When another assignment came, and it could not be determined how to classify the vessel, it was redesignated IX-175 on 10 July 1944.\n* IXSS: Unclassified Miscellaneous Submarines, such as the {{USS|Cod|IXSS-224}}, the {{USS|Angler|IXSS-240}} and the {{USS|Croaker|IXSS-246}}.\n* YAG: Miscellaneous Auxiliary Service Craft, such as the {{USS|George Eastman|YAG-39}}, {{USS|Butternut|YAG-60}} and {{USS|Christiana|YAG-32}} which, curiously, was earlier known as {{USS|Christiana|IX-80|1}}.\n\nNumerous other U.S. Navy vessels were launched with a temporary, or nominal, designation, such as YMS or PC, since it could not be determined, at time of construction, what they should be used for. Many of these were vessels in the 150 to 200 feet length class with powerful engines, whose function could be that of a [[Minesweeper (ship)|minesweeper]], [[patrol craft]], [[submarine chaser]], [[seaplane tender]], [[tugboat]], or other. Once their destiny, or capability, was found or determined, such vessels were reclassified with their actual designation.\n\n== National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration hull codes ==\n* R: Research ships, including oceanographic and fisheries research ships\n* S: Survey ships, including hydrographic survey ships\n\nThe letter is paired with a three-digit number.

If the custodian is acting beyond his or her authority, then the prisoner must be released. Any prisoner, or another person acting on his or her behalf, may petition the court, or a judge, for a writ of ''habeas corpus''. One reason for the writ to be sought by a person other than the prisoner is that the detainee might be held [[Solitary confinement|incommunicado]]. Most [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions provide a similar remedy for those unlawfully detained, but this is not always called ''habeas corpus''.<ref>{{cite book|title=Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution|first=Albert|last=Venn Dicey|url=https://books.google.com/?id=kz40AAAAIAAJ&pg=PR3&dq=INTRODUCTION+TO+THE+STUDY+OF+THE+LAW+OF+THE+CONSTITUTION+A.+V.+Dicey|year=1908}}</ref> For example, in some Spanish-speaking nations, the equivalent remedy for unlawful imprisonment is the ''[[amparo de libertad]]'' (\"protection of freedom\").\n\n''Habeas corpus'' has certain limitations. Though a writ of right, it is not a writ of course.<ref group=\"Note\">The applicant must make out a ''prima facie'' case. However, once that is done, the applicant is entitled to the writ as of right, which is then granted ''ex debito justitae'' (\"from a debt of justice\", that is, as a matter of right)</ref> It is technically only a procedural [[legal remedy|remedy]]; it is a guarantee against any detention that is forbidden by law, but it does not necessarily protect other rights, such as the entitlement to a fair trial. So if an imposition such as internment without trial is permitted by the law, then ''habeas corpus'' may not be a useful remedy. In some countries, the writ has been temporarily or permanently suspended under the pretext of war or [[state of emergency]].{{elucidate|date=February 2016}}\n\nThe right to petition for a writ of ''habeas corpus'' has nonetheless long been celebrated as the most efficient safeguard of the liberty of the subject. The jurist [[Albert Venn Dicey]] wrote that the British [[Habeas Corpus Act 1679|Habeas Corpus Acts]] \"declare no principle and define no rights, but they are for practical purposes worth a hundred constitutional articles guaranteeing individual liberty\".<ref>Anthony Wright (1994) [https://books.google.com/books?id=I7oOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA16&dq=declare+no+principle+and+define+no+rights,+but+they+are+for+practical+purposes+worth+a+hundred+constitutional+articles+guaranteeing+individual+liberty&hl=en&ei=Z04mTJuMA9KUOOSj3bMC&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10&ved=0CFQQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=declare%20no%20principle%20and%20define%20no%20rights%2C%20but%20they%20are%20for%20practical%20purposes%20worth%20a%20hundred%20constitutional%20articles%20guaranteeing%20individual%20liberty&f=false ''Citizens and subjects: an essay on British politics''], Routledge, 1994</ref>\n\nThe writ of ''habeas corpus'' is one of what are called the \"extraordinary\", \"[[common law]]\", or \"[[prerogative writ]]s\", which were historically issued by the [[English courts]] in the name of the monarch to control inferior courts and public authorities within the kingdom. The most common of the other such prerogative writs are ''[[quo warranto]]'', ''[[prohibito]]'', ''[[mandamus]]'', ''[[procedendo]]'', and ''[[certiorari]]''. The due process for such petitions is not simply civil or criminal, because they incorporate the presumption of non-authority. The official who is the respondent must prove his authority to do or not do something. Failing this, the court must decide for the petitioner, who may be any person, not just an interested party. This differs from a motion in a civil process in which the movant must have standing, and bears the burden of proof.\n\n==Etymology==\nFrom Latin ''habeas'', 2nd person singular present [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]] active of ''habere'', \"to have\", \"to hold\"; and ''corpus'', accusative singular of ''corpus'', \"body\". In reference to more than one person, ''habeas corpora''.\n\nLiterally, the phrase means \"[we command] that you have the [detainee's] body [brought to court]\". The complete phrase ''habeas corpus ad subjiciendum'' means \"that you have the person for the purpose of subjecting him/her to (examination)\". These are the opening words of writs in 14th century Anglo-French documents requiring a person to be brought before a court or judge, especially to determine if that person is being legally detained.<ref>{{cite web |title=habeas corpus |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=habeas%20corpus |website=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=17 February 2013}}</ref>\n\n{{quotation|Praecipimus tibi quod '''corpus''' A.B. in prisona nostra sub custodia tua detentum, ut dicitur, una cum die et causa captionis et detentionis suae, quocumque nomine praedictus A.B. censeatur in eadem, '''habeas''' coram nobis ... ad subjiciendum et recipiendum ea quae curia nostra de eo adtunc et ibidem ordinare contigerit in hac parte.

However, other [[writ]]s were issued with the same effect as early as the reign of [[Henry II of England|Henry&nbsp;II]] in the 12th century. Blackstone explained the basis of the writ, saying \"[t]he king is at all times entitled to have an account, why the liberty of any of his subjects is restrained, wherever that restraint may be inflicted.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Blackstone |first1=William |title=Commentaries on the Laws of England: A Facsimile of the First Edition of 1765-1769, vol. 3, pp. 129-37 |date=1768 |publisher=University of Chicago Press (1979), reproduced in ''The Founders' Constitution,'' Volume 3, Article 1, Section 9, Clause 2, Document 4 |location=Chicago |url=http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a1_9_2s4.html |accessdate=6 October 2017}}</ref> The procedure for issuing a writ of ''habeas corpus'' was first codified by the [[Habeas Corpus Act 1679]], following judicial rulings which had restricted the effectiveness of the writ.

Rev. 18 (1940): 172, 174-175.</ref> The cornerstone purpose of the <nowiki>''writ of habeas corpus'' was to limit the King's Chancery's ability to undermine the surety of law by allowing courts of justice decisions to be overturned in favor and application of ''equity'', a process managed by the Chancelor (a bishop) with the King'</nowiki>s authority <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/images/public_education/05_mar08_habeascorpus_landman.pdf|title=Understanding Habeas Corpus|last=Landman|first=James|date=|website=American Bar Association|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref>.\n\nThe 1679 codification of ''habeas corpus'' took place in the context of a [[Exclusion crisis|sharp confrontation]] between King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] and the [[British Parliament|Parliament]], which was dominated by the then sharply oppositional, nascent [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig Party]]. The Whig leaders had good reasons to fear the King moving against them through the courts (as indeed happened in 1681) and regarded ''habeas corpus'' as safeguarding their own persons. The short-lived Parliament which made this enactment came to be known as the ''[[Habeas Corpus Parliament]]'' - being dissolved by the King immediately afterwards.\n\nThen, as now, the writ of ''habeas corpus'' was issued by a superior court in the name of the Sovereign, and commanded the addressee (a lower court, sheriff, or private subject) to produce the prisoner before the royal courts of law. A ''habeas corpus'' petition could be made by the prisoner him or herself or by a third party on his or her behalf and, as a result of the Habeas Corpus Acts, could be made regardless of whether the court was in session, by presenting the petition to a judge. Since the 18th century the writ has also been used in cases of unlawful detention by private individuals, most famously in ''[[Somersett's Case]]'' (1772), where the black slave Somersett was ordered to be freed.<ref>Frederick Charles Moncreiff (2006). \"The Wit and Wisdom of the Bench and Bar\", pp.85\u201386. The Lawbook Exchange, Ltd.</ref> During that case, these famous words are said to have been uttered: \"The air of England has long been too pure for a slave, and every man is free who breathes it\".<ref>George Birkbeck Hil (2004) [https://books.google.com/books?id=2EQCXQ0IbUkC&pg=PA364&dq=The+air+of+England+has+long+been+too+pure+for+a+slave,+and+every+man+is+free+who+breathes+it.&hl=en&ei=qEkmTPatLoesOPHBiM0F&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CCwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=The%20air%20of%20England%20has%20long%20been%20too%20pure%20for%20a%20slave%2C%20and%20every%20man%20is%20free%20who%20breathes%20it.&f=false Life of Johnson, Volume 3] Kessinger Publishing, 2004</ref> During the [[Seven Years' War]] and later conflicts, the Writ was used on behalf of soldiers and sailors [[Impressment|pressed]] into military and naval service.<ref>Costello, Kevin, Habeas Corpus and Military and Naval Impressment 1756\u20131816, The Journal of Legal History 29.2 215 (2008)</ref> The [[Habeas Corpus Act 1816]] introduced some changes and expanded the territoriality of the legislation.\n\nThe privilege of ''habeas corpus'' has been suspended or restricted several times during [[English history]], most recently during the 18th and 19th centuries. Although internment without trial has been authorised by statute since that time, for example during the two [[World War]]s and the [[The Troubles|Troubles]] in [[Northern Ireland]], the ''habeas corpus'' procedure has in modern times always technically remained available to such internees. However, as ''habeas corpus'' is only a procedural device to examine the lawfulness of a prisoner's detention, so long as the detention is in accordance with an [[Act of Parliament]], the petition for ''habeas corpus'' is unsuccessful. Since the passage of the [[Human Rights Act 1998]], the courts have been able to declare an Act of Parliament to be incompatible with the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], but such a declaration of incompatibility has no legal effect unless and until it is acted upon by the government.<ref>[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt200607/jtselect/jtrights/128/12807.htm Joint Committee On Human Rights Sixteenth Report]</ref>\n\nThe wording of the writ of ''habeas corpus'' implies that the prisoner is brought to the court for the legality of the imprisonment to be examined. However, rather than issuing the writ immediately and waiting for the return of the writ by the custodian, modern practice in England is for the original application to be followed by a hearing with both parties present to decide the legality of the detention, without any writ being issued. If the detention is held to be unlawful, the prisoner can usually then be released or [[bail]]ed by order of the court without having to be produced before it. With the development of modern public law, applications for habeas corpus have been to some extent discouraged, in favour of applications for [[judicial review]].<ref>Re (Habeas Corpus) [1996] QB 599; Re B [1991] 1 FLR 106</ref> The writ, however, maintains its vigour, and was held by the UK Supreme Court to be available in respect of a prisoner captured by British forces in Afghanistan, albeit that the Secretary of State made a valid return to the writ justifying the detention of the claimant.<ref>[[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs v Rahmatullah]] [2012] UKSC 48</ref>\n\n==Other jurisdictions==\n===Australia===\nThe writ of ''habeas corpus'' as a procedural remedy is part of [[Australia]]'s English law inheritance.<ref>Clark, David and Gerard McCoy (1998), \"Habeas Corpus\" (Federation Press)</ref> In 2005, the [[Australian parliament]] passed the [[Australian Anti-Terrorism Act 2005]].

The Act was also used to justify German, Slavic, and [[Ukrainian Canadian internment]] during the [[First World War]], and the internment of German-Canadians, Italian-Canadians and [[Japanese Canadian internment|Japanese-Canadians]] during the [[Second World War]].

Its article 5 provides that everyone has the right to liberty and sets forth permissible circumstances under which people may be deprived of their liberty and procedural safeguards in case of detention.

Article 104, paragraph 2 requires that any arrested individual be brought before a judge by the end of the day following the day of the arrest. For those detained as criminal suspects, article 104, paragraph 3 specifically requires that the judge must grant a hearing to the suspect in order to rule on the detention.\n\nRestrictions on the power of the authorities to arrest and detain individuals also emanate from article 2 paragraph 2 of the Basic Law which guarantees liberty and requires a statutory authorization for any deprivation of liberty. In addition, several other articles of the Basic Law have a bearing on the issue. The most important of these are article 19, which generally requires a statutory basis for any infringements of the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Basic Law while also guaranteeing judicial review; article 20, paragraph 3, which guarantees the rule of law; and article 3 which guarantees equality.\n\nIn particular, a constitutional obligation to grant remedies for improper detention is required by article 19, paragraph 4 of the Basic Law, which provides as follows: \"Should any person's right be violated by public authority, he may have recourse to the courts. If no other jurisdiction has been established, recourse shall be to the ordinary courts.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/law/help/habeas-corpus/germany.php |title=Habeas Corpus Rights: Germany&#124;Law Library of Congress |publisher=Loc.gov |date= March 2009|accessdate=2013-06-17}}</ref>\n\n===India===\nThe Indian judiciary, in a catena of cases, has effectively resorted to the writ of ''habeas corpus'' to secure release of a person from illegal detention.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Baxi |first1=Pratiksha (April 2009 - Reprint 2012) |title=Habeas Corpus Juridical Narratives of Sexual Governance |url=http://www.jnu.ac.in/cslg/workingPaper/09-Habeus%20%28Pratiksha%20Baxi%29.pdf |publisher=Centre for the Study of Law and Governance Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi |accessdate=23 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006125237/http://www.jnu.ac.in/cslg/workingPaper/09-Habeus%20%28Pratiksha%20Baxi%29.pdf |archivedate=6 October 2016 |df= }}</ref> For example, in October 2009, the Karnataka High Court heard a ''habeas corpus'' petition filed by the parents of a girl who married a Muslim boy from Kannur district and was allegedly confined in a ''madrasa'' in Malapuram town.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/love-jihad-court-unhappy-with-probe/article169724.ece|title='Love Jihad': court unhappy with probe|date=27 Oct 2009|newspaper=The Hindu}}</ref> Usually, in most other jurisdictions, the writ is directed at police authorities.

The scope of ''habeas'' relief has expanded in recent times by actions of the Indian judiciary.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.legalserviceindia.com/articles/wha.htm |title=Writ Of Habeas Corpus For Securing Liberty - Author - ABS-CBN News |publisher=Legalserviceindia.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-30}}</ref>\n\nIn 1976, the ''habeas'' writ was used in the [[Rajan case]], a student victim of torture in local police custody during the nationwide [[The Emergency (India)|Emergency]] in India. On 12 March 2014, [[Subrata Roy]]'s counsel approached the Chief Justice moving a ''habeas corpus'' petition. It was also filed by the Panthers Party to protest the imprisonment of [[Anna Hazare]], a social activist.\n\n===Ireland===\nIn the [[Republic of Ireland]], the writ of ''habeas corpus'' is available at common law and under the Habeas Corpus Acts of 1782 and 1816. A remedy equivalent to ''habeas corpus'' is also guaranteed by Article 40 of the [[Constitution of Ireland|1937 constitution]].\n\nThe article guarantees that \"no citizen shall be deprived of his personal liberty save in accordance with law\" and outlines a specific procedure for the [[High Court (Ireland)|High Court]] to enquire into the lawfulness of any person's detention. It does not mention the Latin term, ''habeas corpus'', but includes the English phrase \"produce the body\".\n\nArticle 40.4.2\u00b0 provides that a prisoner, or anyone acting on his behalf, may make a complaint to the High Court (or to any High Court judge) of unlawful detention. The court must then investigate the matter \"forthwith\" and may order that the defendant bring the prisoner before the court and give reasons for his detention. The court must immediately release the detainee unless it is satisfied that he is being held lawfully. The remedy is available not only to prisoners of the state, but also to persons unlawfully detained by any private party. However the constitution provides that the procedure is not binding on the [[Irish Defence Forces|Defence Forces]] during a state of war or armed rebellion.\n\nThe full text of Article 40.4.2\u00b0 is as follows: {{quote|Upon complaint being made by or on behalf of any person to the High Court or any judge thereof alleging that such person is being unlawfully detained, the High Court and any and every judge thereof to whom such complaint is made shall forthwith enquire into the said complaint and may order the person in whose custody such person is detained to ''produce the body'' of such person before the High Court on a named day and to certify in writing the grounds of his detention, and the High Court shall, upon the body of such person being produced before that Court and after giving the person in whose custody he is detained an opportunity of justifying the detention, order the release of such person from such detention unless satisfied that he is being detained in accordance with the law. [''Italics'' added]}}\n\nThe writ of ''habeas corpus'' continued as part of the Irish law when the state seceded from the [[United Kingdom]] in 1922. A remedy equivalent to ''habeas corpus'' was also guaranteed by Article 6 of the [[Constitution of the Irish Free State]], enacted in 1922. That article used similar wording to Article 40.4 of the current constitution, which replaced it 1937.\n\nThe relationship between the Article 40 and the Habeas Corpus Acts of 1782 and 1816 is ambiguous, and Forde and Leonard write that \"The extent if any to which Art 40.4 has replaced these Acts has yet to be determined\". In ''The State (Ahern) v Cotter'' (1982) Walsh J opined that the ancient writ referred to in the Habeas Corpus Acts remains in existence in Irish law as a separate remedy from that provided for in Article 40.<ref>Michael Forde, David Leonard, ''Constitutional Law of Ireland'', 2013, pp. 371-372.</ref>\n\nIn 1941, the Article 40 procedure was restricted by the [[Second Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|Second Amendment]]. Prior to the amendment, a prisoner had the constitutional right to apply to any [[High Court of the Republic of Ireland|High Court]] judge for an enquiry into her detention, and to as many High Court judges as she wished. If the prisoner successfully challenged her detention before the High Court she was entitled to immediate, unconditional release.\n\nThe Second Amendment provided that a prisoner has only the right to apply to a single judge, and, once a writ has been issued, the President of the High Court has authority to choose the judge or panel of three judges who will decide the case. If the High Court finds that the prisoner's detention is unlawful due to the unconstitutionality of a law the judge must refer the matter to the [[Irish Supreme Court|Supreme Court]], and until the Supreme's Court's decision is rendered the prisoner may be released only on bail.\n\nThe power of the state to detain persons prior to trial was extended by the [[Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|Sixteenth Amendment]], in 1996. In 1965, the Supreme Court ruled in the ''O'Callaghan'' case that the constitution required that an individual charged with a crime could be refused bail only if she was likely to flee or to interfere with witnesses or evidence. Since the Sixteenth Amendment, it has been possible for a court to take into account whether a person has committed serious crimes while on bail in the past.\n\n===Italy===\nThe right to freedom from arbitrary detention is guaranteed by Article 13 of the [[Constitution of Italy]], which states:<ref>{{cite web|title=The Italian Constitution|url=http://www.quirinale.it/page/costituzione|publisher=The official website of the Presidency of the Italian Republic}}</ref> {{quote|Personal liberty is inviolable. No one may be detained, inspected, or searched nor otherwise subjected to any restriction of personal liberty except by order of the Judiciary stating a reason and only in such cases and in such manner as provided by the law. In exceptional circumstances and under such conditions of necessity and urgency as shall conclusively be defined by the law, the police may take provisional measures that shall be referred within 48 hours to the Judiciary for validation and which, in default of such validation in the following 48 hours, shall be revoked and considered null and void. Any act of physical and moral violence against a person subjected to restriction of personal liberty shall be punished. The law shall establish the maximum duration of preventive detention.}}\n\n===Malaysia===\nIn [[Malaysia]], the remedy of ''habeas corpus'' is guaranteed by the federal constitution, although not by name. Article 5(2) of the [[Constitution of Malaysia]] provides that \"Where complaint is made to a High Court or any judge thereof that a person is being unlawfully detained the court shall inquire into the complaint and, unless satisfied that the detention is lawful, shall order him to be produced before the court and release him\".\n\nAs there are several statutes, for example, the [[Internal Security Act (Malaysia)|Internal Security Act 1960]], that still permit detention without trial, the procedure is usually effective in such cases only if it can be shown that there was a procedural error in the way that the detention was ordered.\n\n===New Zealand===\nIn [[New Zealand]], ''habeas corpus'' may be invoked against the government or private individuals. In 2006, a child was allegedly kidnapped by his maternal grandfather after a custody dispute. The father began ''habeas corpus'' proceedings against the mother, the grandfather, the grandmother, the great grandmother, and another person alleged to have assisted in the kidnap of the child. The mother did not present the child to the court and so was imprisoned for [[contempt of court]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&ObjectID=10407667|title=New Zealand Herald newspaper|publisher=Nzherald.co.nz|date=2006-10-26|accessdate=2010-08-30}}</ref> She was released when the grandfather came forward with the child in late January 2007.\n\n===Pakistan===\nIssuance of a writ is an exercise of an extraordinary jurisdiction of the superior courts in Pakistan. A writ of habeas corpus may be issued by any High Court of a province in Pakistan. Article 199 of the [[Constitution of Pakistan|1973 Constitution]] of the [[Islamic Republic of Pakistan]], specifically provides for the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus, empowering the courts to exercise this prerogative. Subject to the Article 199 of the Constitution, \"A High Court may, if it is satisfied that no other adequate remedy is provided by law, on the application of any person, make an order that a person in custody within the territorial jurisdiction of the Court be brought before it so that the Court may satisfy itself that he is not being held in custody without a lawful authority or in an unlawful manner\". The hallmark of extraordinary constitutional jurisdiction is to keep various functionaries of State within the ambit of their authority. Once a High Court has assumed jurisdiction to adjudicate the matter before it, justiciability of the issue raised before it is beyond question. The Supreme Court of Pakistan has stated clearly that the use of words \"in an unlawful manner\" implies that the court may examine, if a statute has allowed such detention, whether it was a colorable exercise of the power of authority. Thus, the court can examine the malafides of the action taken.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/law/help/habeas-corpus/pakistan.php|title=Habeas Corpus Rights: Pakistan|work=loc.gov|date=March 2009}}</ref>\n\n===The Philippines===\nIn the Bill of Rights of the Philippine constitution, ''habeas corpus'' is guaranteed in terms almost identically to those used in the U.S. Constitution. in Article 3, Section 15 of the [[Constitution of the Philippines]] states that \"The privilege of the writ of ''habeas corpus'' shall not be suspended except in cases of invasion or rebellion when the public safety requires it\".\n\nIn 1971, after the [[Plaza Miranda bombing]], the Marcos administration, under [[Ferdinand Marcos]], suspended ''habeas corpus'' in an effort to stifle the oncoming insurgency, having blamed the [[Communist Party of the Philippines|Filipino Communist Party]] for the events of August 21. Many considered this to be a prelude to [[martial law]]. After widespread protests, however, the Arroyo administration decided to reintroduce the writ. In December 2009, ''habeas corpus'' was suspended in Maguindanao as the province was placed under martial law. This occurred in response to the [[Maguindanao massacre]].<ref>{{cite web|author=andoybarrios on Sat, 12/05/2009 - 23:08|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/12/04/09/arroyo-orders-martial-law-maguindanao|title=Arroyo proclaims martial law in Maguindanao - ABS-CBN News Online|publisher=Abs-cbnnews.com|date=2009-12-05|accessdate=2010-08-30}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, President [[Rodrigo Duterte]] said he was planning on suspending the habeas corpus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/152167-duterte-suspend-writ-habeas-corpus-warning|title=Duterte to suspend writ of habeas corpus if 'forced'|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nOn May 23, 2017 at 10&nbsp;pm Philippine time, President [[Rodrigo Duterte]] declared martial law in the whole island of Mindanao including Sulu and Tawi-tawi for the period of 60 days due to the series of attacks mounted by the [[Maute group]], an ISIS-linked terrorist organization.

This is now known as the Criminal Procedure Act 1701 c.6.<ref>See [http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?ActiveTextDocId=1519689 Full text of the Act]. This law was given its current short title by the [[Statute Law Revision (Scotland) Act 1964]]</ref> It was originally called \"the Act for preventing wrongful imprisonment and against undue delays in trials\". It is still in force although certain parts have been repealed.\n\n===Spain===\nThe present [[Constitution of Spain]] states that \"A ''habeas corpus'' procedure shall be provided for by law to ensure the immediate handing over to the judicial authorities of any person illegally arrested\". The statute which regulates the procedure is the ''Law of Habeas Corpus of 24 May 1984'', which provides that a person imprisoned may, on her or his own or through a third person, allege that she or he is imprisoned unlawfully and request to appear before a judge. The request must specify the grounds on which the detention is considered to be unlawful, which can be, for example, that the custodian holding the prisoner does not have the legal authority, that the prisoner's constitutional rights have been violated, or that he has been subjected to mistreatment. The judge may then request additional information if needed, and may issue a ''habeas corpus'' order, at which point the custodian has 24 hours to bring the prisoner before the judge.\n\nHistorically, many of the territories of Spain had remedies equivalent to the ''habeas corpus'', such as the privilege of ''manifestaci\u00f3n'' in the [[Crown or Aragon]] or the right of the Tree in [[Biscay]].\n\n===United States===\n{{Main|Habeas corpus in the United States}}\n<!-- This section is only a BRIEF SUMMARY. Please consider adding extra material to the main article instead! -->\nThe United States inherited ''habeas corpus'' from the [[English common law]]. In England, the writ was issued in the name of the monarch. When the original [[Thirteen Colonies|thirteen American colonies]] declared independence, and became a republic based on popular sovereignty, any person, in the name of the people, acquired authority to initiate such writs. The [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] specifically includes the ''habeas'' procedure in the [[Suspension Clause]] (Clause 2), located in [[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article One]], Section 9. This states that \"The privilege of the writ of ''habeas corpus'' shall not be suspended, unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it\".\n\nThe writ of ''habeas corpus ad subjiciendum'' is a civil, not criminal, ''[[ex parte]]'' proceeding in which a court inquires as to the legitimacy of a prisoner's custody. Typically, ''habeas corpus'' proceedings are to determine whether the court that imposed sentence on the defendant had jurisdiction and authority to do so, or whether the defendant's sentence has expired. ''Habeas corpus'' is also used as a legal avenue to challenge other types of custody such as pretrial detention or detention by the [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement|United States Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] pursuant to a deportation proceeding.\n\nPresidents [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[Ulysses Grant]] suspended ''habeas corpus'' during the Civil War and Reconstruction for some places or types of cases.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usgovinfo.about.com/od/historicdocuments/a/lincolnhabeas.htm |title=Abraham Lincoln's 1862 Proclamation Suspending Habeas Corpus |publisher=Usgovinfo.about.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=70261 |title=Ulysses S. Grant: Proclamation 204 \u2013 Suspending the Writ of Habeas Corpus in the County of Union, South Carolina |publisher=Presidency.ucsb.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-06-17}}</ref> During [[World War II]], President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] suspended habeas corpus. Following the [[September 11 attacks]], President [[George W. Bush]] attempted to place [[Guantanamo Bay]] detainees outside of the jurisdiction of ''habeas corpus'', but the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] overturned this action in ''[[Boumediene v. Bush]]''.\n\n==Equivalent remedies==\n===Biscay===\nIn 1526, the ''Fuero Nuevo of the Se\u00f1or\u00edo de Vizcaya'' (''New Charter of the Lordship of Biscay'') established a form of ''habeas corpus'' in the territory of the ''[[Lord of Biscay|Se\u00f1or\u00edo de Vizcaya]]'', nowadays part of [[Spain]]. This revised version of the ''Fuero Viejo'' (Old Charter) of 1451 codified the medieval custom whereby no person could be arbitrarily detained without being summoned first to the [[Gernikako Arbola|Oak of Gernika]], an ancestral oak tree located in the outskirts of [[Gernika]] under which all laws of the Lordship of Biscay were passed. \n\nThe New Charter formalised that no one could be detained without a court order (Law 26 of Chapter 9) nor due to debts (Law 3 of Chapter 16). It also established that no one could be arrested without previously having been summoned to the [[Gernikako Arbola|Oak of Gernika]] and given 30 days to answer the said summon, and that upon presenting themselves under the Tree, they had to be provided with all evidence and accusations so that they could defend themselves (Law 7 of Chapter 9). No one could be sent to prison or deprived of their freedom until being formally trialed, and no one could be accused of a different crime until their current court trial was over (Law 5 of Chapter 5). Those fearing they were being arrested illegally could appeal to the ''Regimiento General'' that their rights could be upheld. The ''Regimiento'' (the executive arm of the [[Juntas Generales]] of Biscay) would demand the prisoner be handed over to them, and thereafter the prisoner would be released and placed under the protection of the Regimiento while awaiting for trial<ref>Trask, L. The History of Basque Routledge: 1997 {{ISBN|0-415-13116-2}}</ref>. \n\n===Crown of Aragon===\nThe [[Crown of Aragon]] also had a remedy equivalent to the ''habeas corpus'' called the ''manifestaci\u00f3n de personas'' (literally, ''demonstration of persons'').<ref>R.E. Giesey, If not, not: The Oath of the Aragonese and the Legendary Laws of Sobrarbe. Princeton University Press, 1968</ref> According to the right of ''manifestaci\u00f3n'', the [[Justicia de Aragon]] (lit. ''Justice of Aragon'', an aragonese judiciary figure similar to an [[ombudsman]], but with far reaching executive powers) could require a judge, a court of justice, or any other official that they handed to the ''Justicia'' (i.e., that they ''demonstrated'') anyone being prosecuted so as to guarantee that this person's rights were upheld, and that no violence would befall this person prior to him being sentenced <ref>Tom\u00e1s y Valiente, Francisco (2000). La tortura judicial en Espa\u00f1a (2\u00aa edici\u00f3n). Barcelona: Cr\u00edtica. {{ISBN|84-8432-029-4}}.</ref>. Furthermore, the ''Justicia'' retained the right to examine the judgement and decide whether it satisfied the conditions of a fair trial; if the ''Justicia'' was not satisfied, he could refuse to hand the accused back to the authorities. The right of ''manifestaci\u00f3n'' acted like an habeas corpus: knowing that the appeal to the ''Justicia'' would immediately follow any unlawful detention, these were effectively illegal. Equally, [[torture]] (which had been banned since 1325 in Aragon) could never took place.<ref>Tom\u00e1s y Valiente, Francisco (2000). La tortura judicial en Espa\u00f1a (2\u00aa edici\u00f3n). Barcelona: Cr\u00edtica. {{ISBN|84-8432-029-4}}.</ref> In some cases, people exerting their right of manifestaci\u00f3n were kept under the Justicia's watch in ''manifestaci\u00f3n'' prisons (famous for their mild and easy conditions) or house arrest; more generally however, the person was released from confinement and placed under the ''Justicia's protection'', awaiting trial. The ''Justicia'' always granted the right of ''manifestaci\u00f3n'' by default, but they only really had to act in extreme cases, as for instance famously happened in 1590 when [[Antonio P\u00e9rez (statesman)|Antonio P\u00e9rez]], the disgraced secretary to [[Philip II of Spain]], fled from [[Castile]] to Aragon and used his aragonese ascendency to appeal to the ''Justicia'' for manifestaci\u00f3n right, and therefore prevent his arrest at the King's behest. \n\nThe right of ''manifestaci\u00f3n'' was codified in 1325 in the [[ Declaratio Privilegii generalis]] passed by the [[Aragonese Corts]] under king [[James II of Aragon]]<ref>Gonz\u00e1lez Ant\u00f3n, Luis, ''Las Uniones aragonesas y las Cortes del Reino (1283-1301)'', Zaragoza, Escuela de Estudios Medievales; CSIC; Librer\u00eda General, 1975. {{ISBN|978-84-00-04150-2}} [http://books.google.es/books?id=sIYVCrzY8-4C&lpg=PP1&hl=es&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false Vol I.

It had been practiced since the inception of the kingdom of Aragon in the 11th century, and therefore predates the ''habeas corpus'' itself.<ref>Tom\u00e1s y Valiente, Francisco (2000).

This revolutionary innovation in civil [[libertarianism]] gave Polish citizens due process-style rights that did not exist in any other European country for another 250 years. Originally, the Privilege of Jedlnia was restricted to the nobility (the [[szlachta]]), but it was extended to cover townsmen in the [[Constitution of 3rd May|1791 Constitution]]. Importantly, social classifications in the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] were not as rigid as in other European countries; townspeople and Jews were sometimes ennobled. The Privilege of Jedlnia provided broader coverage than many subsequently enacted habeas corpus laws because Poland's nobility constituted an unusually large percentage of the country's total population, which was Europe's largest. As a result, by the 16th century, it was protecting the liberty of between five hundred thousand and a million Poles.<ref>[http://indylaw.indiana.edu/instructors/cole/web%20page/polconst.pdf Poland's 1997 Constitution in Its Historical Context]; Daniel H.

In 1952, he filed a petition for a \"United Nations Writ of Habeas Corpus\" on behalf of [[William N. Oatis]], an American journalist jailed the previous year by the Communist government of [[Czechoslovakia]].<ref>The petition was titled \"United Nations Ex Rel., Luis Kutner, For and on Behalf of William N.

Through his administrative direction, he is regarded as the main initiator of what would be known as the [[Age of Discovery]]. Henry was the fourth<ref>Bulliet, Richard W. ''The Earth and Its Peoples: A Global History''. Boston: Wadsworth Cengage Learning, 2011. Print.</ref> child of the Portuguese king [[John I of Portugal|John I]] and responsible for the early development of Portuguese exploration and maritime trade with other continents through the systematic exploration of Western Africa, the islands of the Atlantic Ocean, and the search for new routes.\n\nKing John I founded the [[House of Aviz]]. Henry encouraged his father to conquer [[Ceuta]] (1415), the [[Muslim]] port on the [[North Africa]]n coast across the [[Straits of Gibraltar]] from the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. He learned of the opportunities offered by the [[Sahara]]n trade routes that terminated there, and became fascinated with [[Africa]] in general; he was most intrigued by the Christian legend of [[Prester John]] and the expansion of Portuguese trade. Henry is regarded as the patron of [[Portugal in the Age of Discovery|Portuguese exploration]].\n\n== Life ==\n[[File:Henry the Navigator (Cronicas).jpg|thumb|220px|upright|Frontispiece of [[Gomes Eanes de Zurara|Zurara]]'s ''Cr\u00f3nicas dos Feitos de Guin\u00e9'' (Paris codex), with the phrase ''talent de bien faire'' (\"the talent of doing well\" or \"Hunger for good deeds\") and the pyramids, of Prince Henry's ''motto''. It has been argued that the image inserted portrays his brother, King [[Duarte I of Portugal|Duarte]], rather than Henry. The ''empresa'' or ''divisa'' placed below is Henry's motto. According to Friar [[Lu\u00eds de Sousa (writer)|Luis de Sousa]], based on papers of Henry`s contemporary chronicler [[Gomes Eanes de Zurara]], and other 15th-century documents, Henry's pyramids represented the [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids of Egypt]], at [[Giza]], and at the top of his pyramids was a golden sun.]]\n\nHenry was the third surviving son of [[John I of Portugal|King John I]] and his wife [[Philippa of Lancaster|Philippa]],<ref name=mariners>[http://ageofex.marinersmuseum.org/index.php?type=explorer&id=33 \"Prince Henry the Navigator\", The Mariners' Museum]</ref> sister of [[Henry IV of England|King Henry IV of England]]. He was baptized in [[Porto]], and may have been born there, probably when the royal couple was living in the city's old [[mint (coin)|mint]], now called [[Casa do Infante]] (Prince's House), or in the region nearby. Another possibility is that he was born at the Monastery of Le\u00e7a do Bailio, in [[Fort of Le\u00e7a de Palmeira|Le\u00e7a de Palmeira]], during the same period of the royal couple's residence in the city of Porto.\n\nHenry was 21 when he and his father and brothers [[Conquest of Ceuta|captured the Moorish port of Ceuta]] in northern [[Morocco]]. Ceuta had long been a base for [[Barbary pirate]]s who raided the Portuguese coast, depopulating villages by capturing their inhabitants to be sold in the [[African slave trade]]. Following this success, Henry began to explore the coast of Africa, most of which was unknown to Europeans. His objectives included finding the source of the [[West Africa]]n gold trade and the legendary Christian kingdom of [[Prester John]], and stopping the pirate attacks on the Portuguese coast.\n\nAt that time, the ships of the Mediterranean were too slow and too heavy to make these voyages. Under his direction, a new and much lighter ship was developed, the [[caravel]], which could sail further and faster,<ref>\n{{cite book\n|title=The Genius That Was China: East and West in the Making of the Modern World\n|last1=Merson\n |first1= John\n|authorlink= \n|year= 1990|publisher = The Overlook Press\n|location=Woodstock, New York\n|isbn= 0-87951-397-7|pages=72\n| postscript =A companion to the PBS Series ''The Genius That Was China''}}</ref> and, above all, was highly maneuverable and could sail much nearer the wind, or \"[[Sailing into the wind|into the wind]]\". This made the caravel largely independent of the prevailing winds. \nWith the caravel, Portuguese mariners explored rivers and shallow waters as well as the open ocean with wide autonomy. In fact, the invention of the caravel was what made Portugal poised to take the lead in transoceanic exploration.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Discoverers: A History of Man's Search to Know His World and Himself|last=Boorstin|first=Daniel|publisher=Vintage|year=1985|isbn=|location=|pages=156\u201364}}</ref>\n\nIn 1419, Henry's father appointed him governor of the province of the [[Algarve]].\n\n== Resources and income ==\nOn 25 May 1420, Henry gained appointment as the Grand Master of the [[Order of Christ (Portugal)|Military Order of Christ]], the Portuguese successor to the [[Knights Templar]], which had its headquarters at [[Tomar]], in central Portugal.<ref name=Prestage>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07239a.htm Prestage, Edgar. \"Prince Henry the Navigator.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 7. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 23 May 2015</ref> Henry held this position for the remainder of his life, and the Order was an important source of funds for Henry's ambitious plans, especially his persistent attempts to conquer the [[Canary Islands]], which the Portuguese had claimed to have discovered before the year 1346.\n\nIn 1425, his second brother the Infante [[Peter, Duke of Coimbra]], made a tour of Europe. While largely a diplomatic mission, among his goals was to seek out geographic material for his brother Henry. Peter returned from Venice with a current world map drafted by a Venetian cartographer.<ref name=Rush>[http://www.21stcenturysciencetech.com/Articles_2014/Henry_Navigator.pdf Rush, Timothy. \"Prince Henry the Navigator and the Apollo Project that Launched Columbus\", ''21st Century'', summer, 1992]</ref>\n\nIn 1431, he donated houses for the ''[[Estudo Geral]]'' to reunite all the sciences\u2014grammar, logic, rhetoric, arithmetic, music, and astronomy\u2014into what would later become the [[University of Lisbon]]. For other subjects like medicine or philosophy, he ordered that each room should be decorated according to each subject that was being taught.\n\nHenry also had other resources. When John I died in 1433, Henry's eldest brother [[Edward of Portugal]] became king. He granted Henry all profits from trading within the areas he discovered as well as the sole right to authorize expeditions beyond [[Cape Bojador]]. Henry also held a monopoly on tuna fishing in the [[Algarve]]. When Edward died eight years later, Henry supported his brother [[Peter, Duke of Coimbra]] for the regency during the minority of Edward's son [[Afonso V of Portugal|Afonso V]], and in return received a confirmation of this levy.\n\nHenry functioned as a primary organizer of the disastrous [[Battle of Tangier (1437)|expedition to Tangier]] in 1437. Henry's younger brother [[Ferdinand the Saint Prince|Ferdinand]] was given as a hostage to guarantee that the Portuguese would fulfill the terms of the peace agreement that had been made with \u00c7ala Ben \u00c7ala. The [[Portuguese Cortes]] refused to approve the return of [[Ceuta]] in exchange for the Infante Ferdinand who remained in captivity until his death six years later.\n\nPrince Regent Peter had an important role and responsibility in the Portuguese maritime expansion in the Atlantic Ocean and Africa during his administration. Henry promoted the colonization of the [[Azores]] during Peter's regency (1439\u20131448).\n\nFor most of the latter part of his life, Henry concentrated on his maritime activities, or on Portuguese court politics.\n\n== Vila do Infante and Portuguese exploration ==\n[[File:Alternative Henry the Navigator (St. Vincent Panels).jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait believed to be the true likeness of Henry the Navigator. Detail from the fifth panel of the [[Saint Vincent Panels|polyptych of St. Vincent]] by [[Nuno Gon\u00e7alves]], c.1470]]\nAccording to [[Jo\u00e3o de Barros]], in the Algarve he repopulated a village that he called [[Sagres (Vila do Bispo)|Ter\u00e7anabal]] (from ''ter\u00e7a nabal'' or ''tercena nabal'').<ref>{{cite book|last=Bluteau|first=Rafael|title=Vocabulario portuguez & latino ...|year=1721|publisher=na officina de Pascoal da Sylva|location=Lisbon|pages=109|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RwGCgmERezIC&pg=PA109}}</ref> This village was situated in a strategic position for his maritime enterprises and was later called Vila do Infante (\"Estate or Town of the Prince\").\n\nIt is traditionally suggested that Henry gathered at his villa on the [[Sagres Point|Sagres]] peninsula a school of navigators and [[mapmaking|map-makers]]. However modern historians hold this to be a misconception. He did employ some cartographers to chart the coast of [[Mauritania]] after the voyages he sent there, but there was no center of navigation science or observatory in the modern sense of the word, nor was there an organized navigational center.<ref name=\"Randles\">Randles, W.G.L. \"The alleged nautical school founded in the fifteenth century at Sagres by Prince Henry of Portugal called the 'Navigator'\".

[[Jehuda Cresques]], a noted [[cartographer]], has been said to have accepted an invitation to come to Portugal to make maps for the infante. This last incident probably accounts for the legend of the School of Sagres, which is now discredited.<ref name=Prestage />\n\nThe first contacts with the African slave market were made by expeditions to ransom Portuguese subjects enslaved by pirate attacks on Portuguese ships or villages. As Sir Peter Russell remarks in his biography, \"In Henryspeak, conversion and enslavement were interchangeable terms.\"<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/prince-henry-the-navigator-a-life/oclc/123072923|title=Prince Henry \"the Navigator\": a life|last=Russell|first=P.

The nearby port of [[Lagos, Portugal|Lagos]] provided a convenient harbor from which these expeditions left. The voyages were made in very small ships, mostly the [[caravel]], a light and maneuverable vessel. The caravel used the [[lateen sail]], the prevailing rig in Christian Mediterranean navigation since late antiquity.<ref>{{harvnb|Castro|Fonseca|Vacas|Ciciliot|2008|p=2}}</ref> Most of the voyages sent out by Henry consisted of one or two ships that navigated by following the coast, stopping at night to tie up along some shore.\n\nDuring Prince Henry's time and after, the Portuguese navigators discovered and perfected the North Atlantic ''[[Volta do Mar]]'' (the \"turn of the sea\" or \"return from the sea\"): the dependable pattern of [[trade winds]] blowing largely from the east near the equator and the returning [[westerlies]] in the mid-Atlantic. This was a major step in the [[history of navigation]], when an understanding of [[Winds in the Age of Sail|oceanic wind patterns]] was crucial to Atlantic navigation, from Africa and the open ocean to Europe, and enabled the main route between the [[New World]] and Europe in the North Atlantic in future voyages of discovery. Although the lateen sail allowed [[Point of sail#Close-hauled|sailing upwind]] to some extent, it was worth even major extensions of course to have a faster and calmer [[Point of sail#Running downwind|following wind]] for most of a journey. Portuguese mariners who sailed south and southwest towards the [[Canary Islands]] and West Africa would afterwards sail far to the northwest \u2014 that is, away from continental Portugal, and seemingly in the wrong direction\u2014before turning northeast near the [[Azores]] islands and finally east to Europe in order to have largely following winds for their full journey. [[Christopher Columbus]] used this on his transatlantic voyages.\n\n=== Madeira ===\nThe first explorations followed not long after the capture of Ceuta in 1415. Henry was interested in locating the source of the [[caravan (travellers)|caravan]]s that brought gold to the city. During the reign of his father, John I, [[Jo\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alves Zarco]] and [[Trist\u00e3o Vaz Teixeira]] were sent to explore along the African coast. Zarco, a knight in service to Prince Henry, had commanded the caravels guarding the coast of Algarve from the incursions of the [[Moors]]. He had also been at Ceuta.\n\nIn 1418, Zarco and Teixeira were blown off-course by a storm while making the ''volta do mar'' westward swing to return to Portugal. They found shelter at an island they named [[Porto Santo Island|Porto Santo]]. Henry directed that Porto Santo be colonized. The move to claim the [[Madeira]]n islands was probably a response to [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]]'s efforts to claim the Canary Islands.<ref>Fernandez-Armesto, Felipe. ''1492: The Year Our World Began''. {{ISBN|1-4088-0950-8}}</ref> In 1420, settlers then moved to the nearby island of [[Madeira Island|Madeira]].\n\n=== The Azores ===\nA chart drawn by the [[Catalans|Catalan]] cartographer, [[Gabriel de Vallseca]] of [[Mallorca]], has been interpreted to indicate that the Azores were first discovered by [[Diogo de Silves]] in 1427. In 1431, [[Gon\u00e7alo Velho]] was dispatched with orders to determine the location of \"islands\" first identified by de Silves. Velho apparently got a far as the [[Formigas]], in the eastern archipelago, before having to return to Sagres, probably due to bad weather.\n\nBy this time the Portuguese navigators had also reached the [[Sargasso Sea]] (western North Atlantic region), naming it after the [[Sargassum]] seaweed growing there (''sarga\u00e7o'' / ''sargasso'' in Portuguese).<ref>http://www.bookdrum.com/books/wide-sargasso-sea/9780140818031/setting.html</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Sargasso Sea|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/blueplanet/infobursts/sargasso_bg.shtml|work=BBC \u2013 Homepage|publisher=BBC|accessdate=6 June 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== West African coast ===\nUntil Henry's time, [[Cape Bojador]] remained the most southerly point known to Europeans on the desert coast of Africa. Superstitious seafarers held that beyond the cape lay sea monsters and the edge of the world. In 1434, [[Gil Eanes]], the commander of one of Henry's expeditions, became the first European known to pass Cape Bojador.\n\n[[File:External Statues, Palm House, Sefton Park (7).jpg|thumb|upright|''Henry the Navigator'' bronze by [[L\u00e9on-Joseph Chavalliaud]] (1899), outside the Palm House at [[Sefton Park]], [[Liverpool]] (in appearance similar to the sculpture of the beginning of the 16th century, in the [[Jer\u00f3nimos Monastery]], Lisbon, possibly close to the true likeness of Prince Henry)]]\n\nUsing the new ship type, the expeditions then pushed onwards. [[Nuno Trist\u00e3o]] and [[Ant\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alves]] reached [[Ras Nouadhibou|Cape Blanco]] in 1441. The Portuguese sighted the [[Bay of Arguin]] in 1443 and built an important fort there around the year 1448. [[Dinis Dias]] soon came across the [[Senegal River]] and rounded the peninsula of [[Cap-Vert]] in 1444. By this stage the explorers had passed the southern boundary of the desert, and from then on Henry had one of his wishes fulfilled: the Portuguese had circumvented the Muslim land-based trade routes across the western [[Sahara Desert]], and slaves and gold began arriving in Portugal. This rerouting of trade devastated  Algiers and Tunis, but made Portugal rich.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Foundations of Early Modern Europe, 1460-1559|last=Rice Jr.|first=Eugene F.|last2=Grafton|first2=Anthony|publisher=W.W.

A cruzado was equal to 400 reis at the time. From 1444 to 1446, as many as forty vessels sailed from [[Lagos, Portugal|Lagos]] on Henry's behalf, and the first private mercantile expeditions began.\n\n[[Alvise Cadamosto]] explored the Atlantic coast of Africa and discovered several islands of the [[Cape Verde]] archipelago between 1455 and 1456. In his first voyage, which started on 22 March 1455, he visited the Madeira Islands and the Canary Islands. On the second voyage, in 1456, Cadamosto became the first European to reach the Cape Verde Islands. [[Ant\u00f3nio Noli]] later claimed the credit. By 1462, the Portuguese had explored the coast of Africa as far as present-day [[Sierra Leone]]. Twenty-eight years later, [[Bartolomeu Dias]] proved that Africa could be circumnavigated when he reached the southern tip of the continent, now known as the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. In 1498, [[Vasco da Gama]] became the first European sailor to reach India by sea.\n\n== Origin of the \"Navigator\" nickname ==\nNo one used the nickname \"Navigator\" to refer to prince Henry during his lifetime or in the following three centuries. The term was coined by two nineteenth-century German historians: [[Heinrich Schaefer]] and [[Gustave de Veer]]. Later on it was made popular by two British authors who included it in the titles of their biographies of the prince: [[Henry Major]] in 1868 and [[Raymond Beazley]] in 1895.<ref name=\"Randles\" /> In Portuguese, even in modern times, it is uncommon to call him by this epithet; the preferred use is \"Infante D.

These valleys were fertile because the soil there was rich and could bear many root crops. The civilizations in [[Mesopotamia]], [[India]], and [[China]] shared many similarities and likely exchanged technologies and ideas such as [[mathematics]] and the [[wheel]]. Other notions such as that of writing likely developed individually in each area. Cities, states and then empires developed in these lowlands.\n\nThe steppe region had long been inhabited by mounted nomads, and from the central steppes they could reach all areas of the Asian continent. The northern part of the continent, covering much of [[Siberia]] was also inaccessible to the steppe nomads due to the dense forests and the [[tundra]].  These areas in Siberia were very sparsely populated.\n\nThe centre and periphery were kept separate by mountains and deserts.  The [[Caucasus Mountains|Caucasus]], [[Himalayas|Himalaya]], [[Karakum Desert]], and [[Gobi Desert]] formed barriers that the steppe horsemen could only cross with difficulty.  While technologically and culturally the city dwellers were more advanced, they could do little militarily to defend against the mounted hordes of the steppe.  However, the lowlands did not have enough open grasslands to support a large horsebound force.  Thus the nomads who conquered states in the Middle East were soon forced to adapt to the local societies.\n\nAsia's history would feature major developments seen in other parts of the world, as well as events that would affect those other regions. These include the trade of the [[Silk Road]], which spread cultures, languages, religion, and disease throughout Afro-Eurasian trade. Another major advancement was the innovation of [[gunpowder]] in medieval China, which led to advanced warfare through the use of [[gun]]s.\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==Prehistory==\n{{main|Prehistory of Asia}}\nA report by archaeologist Rakesh Tewari on Lahuradewa, [[India]] shows new C14 datings that range between 9000 and 8000 BCE associated with rice, making Lahuradewa the earliest Neolithic site in entire South Asia.<ref name=\"archae\">{{cite web\n|url=http://www.uparchaeology.org/archae.pdf\n|title=Second preliminary report of the excavations at Lahuradewa district\n|publisher=Directorate of Archaeology (U.P, India)\n|deadurl=yes\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613040512/http://www.uparchaeology.org/archae.pdf\n|archivedate=2011-06-13\n|df=\n}}\n</ref>\n\nThe [[prehistoric Beifudi site]] near Yixian in [[Hebei]] Province, China,  contains relics of a culture contemporaneous with the [[Cishan culture|Cishan]] and [[Xinglongwa culture|Xinglongwa]] cultures of about 8000\u20137000 BCE, neolithic cultures east of the [[Taihang Mountains]],  filling in an archaeological gap between the two Northern Chinese cultures.

Since there was little rainfall, [[irrigation]] systems were necessary. The [[Ubaid period|Ubaid]] culture flourished from 5500 BCE.\n\n==Ancient==\n===Bronze Age===\n{{Main|Ancient Near East|Synoptic table of the principal old world prehistoric cultures}}\nThe [[Chalcolithic]] period (or Copper Age) began about 4500 BCE, then the [[Bronze Age]] began about 3500 BCE, replacing the Neolithic cultures.\n\nThe [[Indus Valley Civilization]] (IVC) was a Bronze Age civilization (3300\u20131300 BCE; mature period 2600\u20131900 BCE) which was centered mostly in the western part of the Indian Subcontinent; it is considered that an early form of Hinduism was performed during this civilization. Some of the great cities of this civilization include [[Harappa]] and [[Mohenjo-daro]], which had a high level of town planning and arts. The cause of the destruction of these regions around 1700 BCE is debatable, although evidence suggests it was caused by natural disasters (especially flooding).<ref>{{cite web|title=The Indus Valley Civilisation|url=http://library.thinkquest.org/11372/data/history.htm|work=ThinkQuest|accessdate=9 February 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509014129/http://library.thinkquest.org/11372/data/history.htm|archivedate=9 May 2013|df=}}</ref> This era marks [[Vedic period]] in India, which lasted from roughly 1500 to 500 BCE.

Persian politics included a tolerance for other cultures, a highly [[centralized government]], and significant infrastructure developments. Later, in [[Darius I|Darius the Great]]'s rule, the territories were integrated, a bureaucracy was developed, nobility were assigned military positions, tax collection was carefully organized, and spies were used to ensure the loyalty of regional officials. The primary religion of Persia at this time was [[Zoroastrianism]], developed by the philosopher [[Zoroaster]]. It introduced an early form of [[monotheism]] to the area. The religion banned animal sacrifice and the use of intoxicants in rituals; and introduced the concept of spiritual salvation through personal moral action, an [[end time]], and both [[General judgment|general]] and [[Particular judgment]] with a [[heaven]] or [[hell]]. These concepts would heavily influence later emperors and the masses. More importantly, Zoroastrianism would be an important precursor for the [[Abrahamic religions]] such as Christianity, Islam, or Judaism. The Persian Empire was successful in establishing peace and stability throughout the Middle East and were a major influence in art, politics (affecting Hellenistic leaders), and religion.\n\n[[Alexander the Great]] conquered this dynasty in the 4th century BCE, creating the brief [[Hellenistic period]]. He was unable to establish stability and after his death, Persia broke into small, weak dynasties including the [[Seleucid Empire]], followed by the [[Parthian Empire]]. By the end of the Classical age, Persia had been reconsolidated into the [[Sassanid Empire]], also known as the second Persian Empire.\n\nThe [[Roman Empire]] would later control parts of Western Asia. The [[Seleucid]], [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] and [[Sassanid]] dynasties of Persia dominated Western Asia for centuries.\n\n====India====\nThe Maurya and Gupta empires are called the Golden Age of India and were marked by extensive inventions and discoveries in science, technology, art, religion, and philosophy that crystallized the elements of what is generally known as Indian culture. The religions of [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]], which began in Indian sub-continent, were an important influence on South, East and Southeast Asia.\n\nBy 600 BCE, India had been divided into 17 regional states that would occasionally feud amongst themselves. In 327 BCE, [[Alexander the Great]] came to India with a vision of conquering the whole world. He crossed northwestern India and created the province [[Bactria]] but could not move further because his army wanted to go back to their family. Shortly prior, the soldier [[Chandragupta Maurya]] began to take control of the Ganges river and soon established the [[Maurya Empire]]. The Maurya Empire (Sanskrit: \u092e\u094c\u0930\u094d\u092f \u0930\u093e\u091c\u0935\u0902\u0936, Maurya R\u0101javan\u015bha) was the geographically extensive and powerful empire in ancient India, ruled by the Mauryan dynasty from 321 to 185 BCE. It was one of the world's largest empires in its time, stretching to the [[Himalayas]] in the north, what is now [[Assam]] in the east, probably beyond modern [[Pakistan]] in the west, and annexing [[Balochistan]] and much of what is now [[Afghanistan]], at its greatest extent. South of Mauryan empire was the [[Tamilakam]] an independent country dominated by three dynasties, the [[Pandya dynasty|Pandyans]], [[Cholas]] and [[Cheras]]. The government established by Chandragupta was led by an autocratic king, who primarily relied on the military to assert his power.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=65}} It also applied the use of a bureaucracy and even sponsored a postal service.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=65}} Chandragupta's grandson, [[Ashoka]], greatly extended the empire by conquering most of modern-day India (save for the southern tip). He eventually converted to Buddhism, though, and began a peaceful life where he promoted the religion as well as humane methods throughout India. The Maurya Empire would disintegrate soon after Ashoka's death and was conquered by the Kushan invaders from the northwest, establishing the [[Kushan Empire]]. Their conversion to Buddhism caused the religion to be associated with foreigners and therefore a decline in its popularity occurred.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=65}}\n\nThe Kushan Empire would fall apart by 220 CE, creating more political turmoil in India. Then in 320, the [[Gupta Empire]] (Sanskrit: \u0917\u0941\u092a\u094d\u0924 \u0930\u093e\u091c\u0935\u0902\u0936, Gupta R\u0101javan\u015bha) was established and covered much of the Indian Subcontinent. Founded by [[Maharaja Sri-Gupta]], the dynasty was the model of a classical civilization. Gupta kings united the area primarily through negotiation of local leaders and families as well as strategical intermarriage.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=66}} Their rule covered less land than the Maurya Empire, but established the greatest stability.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=66}} In 535, the empire ended when India was overrun by the [[Huns]].\n\n====Classical China====\n\n=====Zhou Dynasty=====\n{{main|Zhou Dynasty}}\nSince 1029 BCE, the [[Zhou Dynasty]] ({{zh|c=\u5468\u671d|p=Zh\u014du Ch\u00e1o|w=Chou Ch'ao}} {{IPA-cmn|t\u0282\u00f3\u028a t\u0282\u02b0\u0251\u030c\u028a|}}), had existed in China and it would continue to until 258 BCE.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=43}} The Zhou dynasty had been using a [[Feudalism|feudal system]] by giving power to local nobility and relying on their loyalty in order to control its large territory.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=43}} As a result, the Chinese government at this time tended to be very decentralized and weak, and there was often little the emperor could do to resolve national issues. Nonetheless, the government was able to retain its position with the creation of the [[Mandate of Heaven]], which could establish an emperor as divinely chosen to rule. The Zhou additionally discouraged the [[human sacrifice]] of the preceding eras and unified the [[Chinese language]]. Finally, the Zhou government encouraged settlers to move into the [[Yangtze River]] valley, thus creating the Chinese Middle Kingdom.\n\nBut by 500 BCE, its political stability began to decline due to repeated nomadic incursions{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=43}} and internal conflict derived from the fighting princes and families. This was lessened by the many philosophical movements, starting with the life of [[Confucius]]. His philosophical writings (called [[Confucianism]]) concerning the respect of elders and of the state would later be popularly used in the Han Dynasty. Additionally, [[Laozi]]'s concepts of [[Taoism]], including [[yin and yang]] and the innate duality and balance of nature and the universe, became popular throughout this period. Nevertheless, the Zhou Dynasty eventually disintegrated as the local nobles began to gain more power and their conflict devolved into the [[Warring States period]], from 402 to 201 BCE.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=44}}\n\n=====Qin Dynasty=====\n{{main|Qin Dynasty}}\nOne leader eventually came on top, [[Qin Shi Huang]] ({{zh|c=\u59cb\u7687\u5e1d}}, ''Sh\u01d0 Hu\u00e1ngd\u00ec''), who overthrew the last Zhou emperor and established the Qin dynasty.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=43}} The [[Qin Dynasty]] (Chinese: \u79e6\u671d; pinyin: Q\u00edn Ch\u00e1o) was the first ruling dynasty of Imperial China, lasting from 221 to 207 BCE.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=42}} The new Emperor abolished the feudal system and directly appointed a bureaucracy that would rely on him for power. Huang's imperial forces crushed any regional resistance, and they furthered the Chinese empire by expanding down to the [[South China Sea]] and northern [[Vietnam]]. Greater organization brought a uniform tax system, a national census, regulated road building (and cart width), standard measurements, standard coinage, and an official written and spoken language.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=45}} Further reforms included new irrigation projects, the encouragement of [[silk]] manufacturing,{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=45}} and (most famously) the beginning of the construction of the Great Wall of China\u2014designed to keep out the nomadic raiders who'd constantly badger the Chinese people. However, Shi Huang was infamous for his tyranny, forcing laborers to build the Wall, ordering heavy taxes, and severely punishing all who opposed him. He oppressed Confucians and promoted [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], the idea that people were inherently evil, and that a strong, forceful government was needed to control them. Legalism was infused with realistic, logical views and rejected the pleasures of educated conversation as frivolous. All of this made Shi Huang extremely unpopular with the people. As the Qin began to weaken, various factions began to fight for control of China.\n\n=====Han Dynasty=====\n{{main|Han Dynasty}}\n[[File:SeidenstrasseGMT.JPG|300px|thumb|The [[Silk Road]] in Asia]]\nThe [[Han Dynasty]] (simplified Chinese: \u6c49\u671d; traditional Chinese: \u6f22\u671d; pinyin: H\u00e0n Ch\u00e1o ;206 BCE \u2013 220 CE) was the second imperial dynasty of China, preceded by the Qin Dynasty and succeeded by the Three Kingdoms (220\u2013265 CE). Spanning over four centuries, the period of the Han Dynasty is considered a golden age in Chinese history. One of the Han Dynasty's greatest emperors, [[Emperor Wu of Han]], established a peace throughout China comparable to the [[Pax Romana]] seen in the Mediterranean a hundred years later.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=45}} To this day, China's majority ethnic group refers to itself as the \"Han people\". The Han Dynasty was established when two peasants succeeded in rising up against Shi Huang's significantly weaker successor-son. The new Han government retained the centralization and bureaucracy of the Qin, but greatly reduced the repression seen before. They expanded their territory into [[Korea]], [[Vietnam]], and [[Central Asia]], creating an even larger empire than the Qin.\n\nThe Han developed contacts with the Persian Empire in the Middle East and the Romans, through the [[Silk Road]], with which they were able to trade many commodities\u2014primarily silk. Many ancient civilizations were influenced by the [[Silk Road]], which connected China, [[India]], the Middle East and Europe. Han emperors like Wu also promoted Confucianism as the national \"religion\" (although it is debated by theologians as to whether it is defined as such or as a philosophy). Shrines devoted to Confucius were built and Confucian philosophy was taught to all scholars who entered the Chinese bureaucracy. The bureaucracy was further improved with the introduction of an examination system that selected scholars of high merit. These bureaucrats were often upper-class people educated in special schools, but whose power was often checked by the lower-class brought into the bureaucracy through their skill. The Chinese imperial bureaucracy was very effective and highly respected by all in the realm and would last over 2,000 years. The Han government was highly organized and it commanded the military, judicial law (which used a system of courts and strict laws), agricultural production, the economy, and the general lives of its people. The government also promoted intellectual philosophy, scientific research, and detailed historical records.\n\nHowever, despite all of this impressive stability, central power began to lose control by the turn of the [[Common Era]]. As the Han Dynasty declined, many factors continued to pummel it into submission until China was left in a state of chaos. By 100 CE, philosophical activity slowed, and corruption ran rampant in the bureaucracy. Local landlords began to take control as the scholars neglected their duties, and this resulted in heavy taxation of the peasantry. Taoists began to gain significant ground and protested the decline. They started to proclaim magical powers and promised to save China with them; the Taoist [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]] in 184 (led by rebels in yellow scarves) failed but was able to weaken the government. The aforementioned Huns combined with diseases killed up to half of the population and officially ended the Han Dynasty by 220. The ensuing period of chaos was so terrible it lasted for three centuries, where many weak regional rulers and dynasties failed to establish order in China. This period of chaos and attempts at order is commonly known as that of the [[Six Dynasties]]. The first part of this included the [[Three Kingdoms]] which  started in 220 and describes the brief and weak successor \"dynasties\" that followed the Han. In 265, the [[Jin dynasty (265\u2013420)|Jin dynasty]] of China was started and this soon split into two different empires in control of northwestern and southeastern China. In 420, the conquest and abdication of those two dynasties resulted in the first of the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]]. The Northern and Southern Dynasties passed through until finally, by 557, the [[Northern Zhou Dynasty]] ruled the north and the [[Chen Dynasty]] ruled the south.\n\n==Medieval{{anchor|Medieval}}==\nDuring this period, the [[Eastern world]] empires continued to expand through trade, migration and conquests of neighboring areas. Gunpowder was widely used as early as the 11th century and they were using moveable type printing five hundred years before Gutenberg created his press. Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism were the dominant philosophies of the Far East during the Middle Ages. Marco Polo was not the first Westerner to travel to the Orient and return with amazing stories of this different culture, but his accounts published in the late 13th and early 14th centuries were the first to be widely read throughout Europe.\n\n===Western Asia (Middle East)===\n{{main|Medieval Middle East}}\n\nThe Arabian peninsula and the surrounding [[Middle East]] and [[Near East]] regions saw dramatic change during the Medieval era caused primarily by the spread of [[Islam]] and the establishment of the Arabian Empires.\n\nIn the 5th century, the Middle East was separated into small, weak states; the two most prominent were the [[Sasanian Empire]] of the [[History of Iran|Persian]]s in what is now [[Iran]] and [[Iraq]], and the Byzantine Empire in [[Anatolia]] (modern-day [[Turkey]]). The Byzantines and Sasanians fought with each other continually, a reflection of the rivalry between the Roman Empire and the Persian Empire seen during the previous five hundred years. The fighting weakened both states, leaving the stage open to a new power. Meanwhile, the nomadic [[Bedouin]] tribes who dominated the Arabian desert saw a period of tribal stability, greater trade networking and a familiarity with Abrahamic religions or monotheism.\n\nWhile the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] Roman and [[Sassanian Empire|Sassanid]] Persian empires were both weakened by the [[Byzantine\u2013Sasanian War of 602\u2013628]], a new power in the form of [[Islam]] grew in the Middle East under [[Muhammad in Medina]]. In a series of rapid [[Muslim conquests]], the [[Rashidun army]], led by the [[Caliph]]s and skilled military commanders such as [[Khalid ibn al-Walid]], swept through most of the Middle East, taking more than half of Byzantine territory in the [[Arab\u2013Byzantine wars]] and completely engulfing Persia in the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]]. It would be the Arab [[Caliphate]]s of the [[Middle Ages]] that would first unify the entire Middle East as a distinct region and create the dominant [[Arab|ethnic identity]] that persists today. These Caliphates included the [[Rashidun Caliphate]], [[Umayyad Caliphate]], [[Abbasid Caliphate]], and later the [[Seljuq Empire]].\n\nAfter Muhammad introduced Islam, it jump-started Middle Eastern culture into an [[Islamic Golden Age]], inspiring achievements in [[architecture]], the revival of old advances in science and technology, and the formation of a distinct way of life. Muslims saved and spread Greek advances in [[History of medicine|medicine]], [[History of elementary algebra|algebra]], [[History of geometry|geometry]], [[History of astronomy|astronomy]], [[History of anatomy|anatomy]], and [[History of ethics|ethics]] that would later finds it way back to Western Europe.\n\nThe dominance of the Arabs came to a sudden end in the mid-11th century with the arrival of the [[Seljuq Turks]], migrating south from the Turkic homelands in Central Asia. They conquered Persia, Iraq (capturing Baghdad in 1055), Syria, Palestine, and the [[Hejaz]]. This was followed by a series of Christian Western Europe invasions. The fragmentation of the Middle East allowed joined forces, mainly from England, France, and the emerging [[Holy Roman Empire]], to enter the region. In 1099 the knights of the [[First Crusade]] captured [[Jerusalem]] and founded the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], which survived until 1187, when [[Saladin]] retook the city. Smaller crusader fiefdoms survived until 1291. In the early 13th century, a new wave of invaders, the armies of the [[Mongol Empire]], swept through the region, sacking Baghdad in the [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)]] and advancing as far south as the border of [[Egypt]] in what became known as the [[Mongol conquests]]. The Mongols eventually retreated in 1335, but the chaos that ensued throughout the empire deposed the Seljuq Turks. In 1401, the region was further plagued by the Turko-Mongol, [[Timur]], and his ferocious raids. By then, another group of Turks had arisen as well, the [[Ottoman Turks|Ottomans]].\n\n===Central Asia===\n{{main|Medieval Central Asia}}\n\n====Mongol Empire====\nThe [[Mongol Empire]] conquered a large part of Asia in the 13th century, an area extending from China to Europe. Medieval Asia was the kingdom of the Khans. Never before had any person controlled as much land as [[Genghis Khan]]. He built his power unifying separate Mongol tribes before expanding his kingdom south and west. He and his grandson, Kublai Khan, controlled lands in China, Burma, Central Asia, Russia, Iran, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe. Estimates are that the Mongol armies reduced the population of China by nearly a third. Genghis Khan was a pagan who tolerated nearly every religion, and their culture often suffered the harshest treatment from Mongol armies. The Khan armies pushed as far west as Jerusalem before being defeated in 1260.\n\n===South Asia===\n====India====\n{{main|Medieval India}}\n[[File:Buddhist Expansion.svg|thumb|right|320px|Buddhist adoption in Asia, Mahayana Buddhism first entered China through [[Silk Road]].]]\n\nThe Indian early medieval age, 600 to 1200, is defined by regional kingdoms and cultural diversity. When [[Harsha]] of [[Kannauj]], who ruled much of the Indo-Gangetic Plain from 606 to 647, attempted to expand southwards, he was defeated by the [[Chalukya dynasty|Chalukya]] ruler of the Deccan. When his successor attempted to expand eastwards, he was defeated by the [[Pala Empire|Pala]] king of [[Bengal]]. When the Chalukyas attempted to expand southwards, they were defeated by the [[Pallava]]s from farther south, who in turn were opposed by the [[Pandyas]] and the [[Cholas]] from still farther south. The Cholas could under the rule of [[Raja Raja Chola]] defeat their rivals and rise to a regional power. Cholas expanded northward and defeated [[Eastern Chalukya]], [[Eastern Ganga dynasty|Kalinga]] and the [[Pala Empire|Pala]]. Under [[Rajendra Chola]] the Cholas created the first notable navy of Indian subcontinent. The [[Chola navy]] extended the influence of Chola empire to [[southeast asia]]. During this time, pastoral peoples whose land had been cleared to make way for the growing agricultural economy were accommodated within caste society, as were new non-traditional ruling classes.<ref>{{citation|last=Stein|first=B.|author-link=Burton Stein|date=16 June 1998|title=A History of India|edition=1st|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|place=Oxford|isbn=978-0-631-20546-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SXdVS0SzQSAC|pages=119\u2013122}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent]] mainly took place from the 12th century onwards, though earlier Muslim conquests made limited inroads into the region, beginning during the period of the ascendancy of the [[Rajput]] Kingdoms in North India, although [[Sindh]] and Multan were captured in 8th century.\n\n===East Asia===\n{{main|History of East Asia}}\n\n====China====\n{{main|Medieval China}}\nChina saw the rise and fall of the Sui, Tang, Song, and Yuan dynasties and therefore improvements in its bureaucracy, the spread of [[Buddhism]], and the advent of [[Neo-Confucianism]]. It was an unsurpassed era for Chinese ceramics and painting. Medieval architectural masterpieces the Great South Gate in Todaiji, Japan, and the Tien-ning Temple in Peking, China are some of the surviving constructs from this era.\n\n=====Sui Dynasty=====\n{{main|Sui Dynasty}}\nA new powerful dynasty began to rise in the 580s, amongst the divided factions of China. This was started when an aristocrat named Yang Jian married his daughter into the Northern Zhou Dynasty. He proclaimed himself [[Emperor Wen of Sui]] and appeased the nomadic military by abandoning the Confucian scholar-gentry. Emperor Wen soon led the conquest of the southern Chen Dynasty and united China once more under the [[Sui Dynasty]]. The emperor lowered taxes and constructed granaries that he used to prevent famine and control the market. Later Wen's son would murder him for the throne and declare himself [[Emperor Yang of Sui]]. Emperor Yang revived the Confucian scholars and the bureaucracy, much to anger of the aristocrats and nomadic military leaders. Yang became an excessive leader who overused China's resources for personal luxury and perpetuated exhaustive attempts to reconquer Korea. His military failures and neglect of the empire forced his own ministers to assassinate him in 618, ending the Sui Dynasty.\n\n=====Tang dynasty=====\n{{main|Tang dynasty}}\n[[File:Battle of Talas.png|thumb|380px|[[Battle of Talas]] between Tang dynasty and [[Abbasid Caliphate]] c. 751]]\n\nFortunately, one of Yang's most respectable advisors, Li Yuan, was able to claim the throne quickly, preventing a chaotic collapse. He proclaimed himself [[Emperor Gaozu of Tang|Emperor Gaozu]], and established the [[Tang dynasty]] in 623. The Tang saw expansion of China through conquest to Tibet in the west, [[Vietnam]] in the south, and Manchuria in the north. Tang emperors also improved the education of scholars in the Chinese bureaucracy. A Ministry of Rites was established and the examination system was improved to better qualify scholars for their jobs.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=270|loc=Chapter 12|quote=In the Tang and Song periods, the examination system was greatly expanded, and the pattern of advancement in the civil service was much more regularized. This meant that in the political realm more than any previous political system (and those yet to come for centuries), the Chinese connected merit as measured by tested skills with authority and status.}} In addition, Buddhism became popular in China with two different strains between the peasantry and the elite, the [[Pure Land Buddhism|Pure Land]] and [[Zen]] strains, respectively.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|pages=271\u2013272|loc=Chapter 12|quote=Among the masses, the salvationist pure land strain of Mahayana Buddhism won widespread conversions because it seemed to provide a refuge from an age of war and turmoil. Members of the elite class, on the other hand, were more attracted to the Chan variant of Buddhism, or Zen as it is known in Japan and the West.}} Greatly supporting the spread of Buddhism was [[Wu Zetian|Empress Wu]], who additionally claimed an unofficial \"Zhou Dynasty\" and displayed China's tolerance of a woman ruler, which was rare at the time. However, Buddhism would also experience some backlash, especially from Confucianists and Taoists. This would usually involve criticism about how it was costing the state money, since the government was unable to tax Buddhist monasteries, and additionally sent many grants and gifts to them.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=273|loc=Chapter 12|quote=Because monastic lands and resources were not taxed, the Tang regime lost huge amounts of revenue as a result of imperial grants or the gifts of wealthy families to Buddhist monasteries.}}\n\nThe Tang dynasty began to decline under the rule of [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang|Emperor Xuanzong]], who began to neglect the economy and military and caused unrest amongst the court officials due to the excessive influence of his concubine, [[Yang Guifei]], and her family.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=274|loc=Chapter 12|quote=The arrogance and excessive ambition of Yang Guifei and her family angered members of the rival cliques at court, who took every opportunity to turn Yang's excesses into a cause for popular unreast.}} This eventually sparked a revolt in 755.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=274|loc=Chapter 12|quote=The deepening crisis came to a head in 755 when one of [Xuanzong]'s main military leaders&nbsp;... led a widely supported revolt with the aim of founding a new dynasty to supplant the Tang.}} Although the revolt failed, subduing it required involvement with the unruly nomadic tribes outside of China and distributing more power to local leaders\u2014leaving the government and economy in a degraded state. The Tang dynasty officially ended in 907 and various factions led by the aforementioned nomadic tribes and local leaders would fight for control of China in the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]].\n\n=====Liao, Song and Jin dynasties=====\n{{main|Liao dynasty|Song dynasty|Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)}}\nBy 960, most of China proper had been reunited under the [[Song dynasty]], although it lost territories in the north and could not defeat one of the nomadic tribes there\u2014the [[Liao dynasty]] of the highly sinicized [[Khitan people]]. From then on, the Song would have to pay tribute to avoid invasion and thus set the precedent for other nomadic kingdoms to oppress them. The Song also saw the revival of Confucianism in the form of [[Neo-Confucianism]]. This had the effect of putting the Confucian scholars at a higher status than aristocrats or Buddhists and also intensified the reduction of power in women. The infamous practice of [[foot binding]] developed in this period as a result. Eventually the Liao dynasty in the north was overthrown by the [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin dynasty]] of the Manchu-related [[Jurchen people]]. The new Jin kingdom [[Jin\u2013Song Wars|invaded northern China]], leaving the Song to flee farther south and creating the [[Southern Song dynasty]] in 1126. There, cultural life flourished.\n\n=====Yuan Dynasty=====\n{{main|Yuan Dynasty}}\n [[File:Route of Marco Polo.png|thumb|380px|Map of Marco Polo's travels]]\nBy 1227, the Mongols had conquered the [[Western Xia]] kingdom northwest of China. Soon the Mongols incurred upon the Jin empire of the Jurchens. Chinese cities were soon besieged by the Mongol hordes that showed little mercy for those who resisted and the Southern Song Chinese were quickly losing territory. In 1271 the current great khan, [[Kublai Khan]], claimed himself Emperor of China and officially established the Yuan Dynasty. By 1290, all of China was under control of the Mongols, marking the first time they were ever completely conquered by a foreign invader; the new capital was established at [[Khanbaliq]] (modern-day [[Beijing]]). Kublai Khan segregated Mongol culture from Chinese culture by discouraging interactions between the two peoples, separating living spaces and places of worship, and reserving top administrative positions to Mongols, thus preventing Confucian scholars to continue the bureaucratic system. Nevertheless, Kublai remained fascinated with Chinese thinking, surrounding himself with Chinese Buddhist, Taoist, or Confucian advisors.\n\nMongol women displayed a contrasting independent nature compared to the Chinese women who continued to be suppressed. Mongol women often rode out on hunts or even to war. Kublai's wife, [[Chabi]], was a perfect example of this; Chabi advised her husband on several political and diplomatic matters; she convinced him that the Chinese were to be respected and well-treated in order to make them easier to rule.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=327|loc=Chapter 14|quote=[Chabi] convinced Kubilai that the harsh treatment of the survivors of the defeated Song imperial family would only anger the peoples of north China and make them more difficult to rule.}} However this was not enough to affect Chinese women's position, and the increasingly Neo-Confucian successors of Kublai further repressed Chinese and even Mongol women.\n\nThe Black Death, which would later ravage Western Europe, had its beginnings in Asia, where it wiped out large populations in China in 1331.\n\n====Japan====\n{{main|Medieval Japan}}\n[[File:Shotoku Taishi.jpg|thumb|left|Sculpture of [[Prince Sh\u014dtoku]]]]\n\n=====Asuka period=====\nJapan's medieval history began with the [[Asuka period]], from around 600 to 710. The time was characterized by the [[Taika Reform]] and imperial centralization, both of which were a direct result of growing Chinese contact and influences. In 603, [[Prince Sh\u014dtoku]] of the [[Imperial House of Japan|Yamato dynasty]] began significant political and cultural changes. He issued the [[Seventeen-article constitution]] in 604, centralizing power towards the emperor (under the title ''tenno'', or heavenly sovereign) and removing the power to levy taxes from provincial lords. Sh\u014dtoku was also a patron of Buddhism and he encouraged building temples competitively.{{sfn|Bowman|2000|pages=124\u2013137}}\n\n=====Nara period=====\nSh\u014dtoku's reforms transitioned Japan to the [[Nara period]] (c. 710 to c. 794), with the moving of the Japanese capital to [[Nara, Nara|Nara]] in [[Honshu]]. This period saw the culmination of Chinese-style writing, etiquette, and architecture in Japan along with Confucian ideals{{sfn|Stearns|Adas|Schwartz|Gilbert|2011|pages=291\u2013301}} to supplement the already present Buddhism. Peasants revered both Confucian scholars and Buddhist monks. However, Buddhism gained the status of state religion, and the government ordered the construction of Buddhist temples, monasteries, and statues.{{sfn|Bowman|2000|pages=124\u2013137}} The lavish spending combined with the fact that many aristocrats did not pay taxes, put a heavy burden on peasantry that caused poverty and famine.{{sfn|Bowman|2000|pages=124\u2013137}} Eventually the Buddhist position got out of control, threatening to seize imperial power and causing [[Emperor Kanmu]] to move the capital to [[Heian-ky\u014d]] to avoid a Buddhist takeover.{{sfn|Stearns|Adas|Schwartz|Gilbert|2011|pages=291\u2013301}} This marked the beginning of the [[Heian period]] and the end of Taika reform.\n\n=====Heian period=====\nWith the Heian period (from 794 to 1185) came a decline of imperial power. Chinese influence also declined, as a result of its correlation with imperial centralization and the [[Mandate of Heaven|heavenly mandate]], which came to be regarded as ineffective. By 838, the Japanese court discontinued its embassies in China; only traders and Buddhist monks continued to travel to China. Buddhism itself came to be considered more Japanese than Chinese, and persisted to be popular in Japan. Buddhists monks and monasteries continued their attempts to gather personal power in courts, along with aristocrats. One particular noble family that dominated influence in the imperial bureaucracy was the [[Fujiwara clan]]. During this time cultural life in the imperial court flourished. There was a focus on beauty and social interaction and writing and literature was considered refined. Noblewomen were cultured the same as noblemen, dabbling in creative works and politics. A prime example of both Japanese literature and women's role in high-class culture at this time was ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'', written by the [[lady-in-waiting]] [[Murasaki Shikibu]]. Popularization of wooden palaces and [[sh\u014dji]] sliding doors amongst the nobility also occurred.\n\nLoss of imperial power also led to the rise of provincial warrior elites. Small lords began to function independently. They administered laws, supervised public works projects, and collected revenue for themselves instead of the imperial court. Regional lords also began to build their own armies. These warriors were loyal only their local lords and not the emperor, although the imperial government increasingly called them in to protect the capital. The regional warrior class developed into the [[samurai]], which created its own culture: including specialized weapons such as the [[katana]] and a form of chivalry, [[bushido]]. The imperial government's loss of control in the second half of the Heian period allowed banditry to grow, requiring both feudal lords and Buddhist monasteries to procure warriors for protection. As imperial control over Japan declined, feudal lords also became more independent and seceded from the empire. These feudal states squandered the peasants living in them, reducing the farmers to an almost [[serfdom]] status. Peasants were also rigidly restricted from rising to the samurai class, being physically set off by dress and weapon restrictions. As a result of their oppression, many peasants turned to Buddhism as a hope for reward in the afterlife for upright behavior.{{sfn|Stearns|Adas|Schwartz|Gilbert|2011|pages=296}}\n\nWith the increase of feudalism, families in the imperial court began to depend on alliances with regional lords. The Fujiwara clan declined from power, replaced by a rivalry between the [[Taira clan]] and the [[Minamoto clan]]. This rivalry grew into the [[Genpei War]] in the early 1180s. This war saw the use of both samurai and peasant soldiers. For the samurai, battle was ritual and they often easily cut down the poorly trained peasantry. The Minamoto clan proved successful due to their rural alliances. Once the Taira was destroyed, the Minamoto established a military government called the [[shogunate]] (or bakufu), centered in [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]].\n\n=====Kamakura period=====\nThe end of the Genpei War and the establishment of the [[Kamakura shogunate]] marked the end of the Heian period and the beginning of the [[Kamakura period]] in 1185, solidifying feudal Japan.\n\n====Korea====\n{{main|Medieval Korea}}\nKorea was fought between the three local kingdoms: [[Silla]], [[Baekje]], and [[Goguryeo]]. This continued until the Silla allied with Tang China to conquer all of Korea. Attempts at sinicization occurred.\n\n===Southeast Asia===\n{{main|Medieval Southeast Asia}}\n\n==Early modern==\n{{further|Early modern period}}\n[[File:Modern Asia (1796).tif|thumb|245px|A 1796 map of Asia (or the \"[[Eastern world]]\"), which also included the continent of [[Australia]] (then known as [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]]) within its realm.]]\nThe [[Russian Empire]] began to expand into Asia from the 17th century, and would eventually take control of all of [[Siberia]] and most of Central Asia by the end of the 19th century. The [[Ottoman Empire]] controlled Anatolia, the Middle East, North Africa and the Balkans from the 16th century onwards. In the 17th century, the [[Manchu people|Manchu]] conquered China and established the [[Qing Dynasty]]. In the 16th century, the [[Mughal Empire]] controlled much of India and initiated the second golden age for India. China was the largest economy in the world for much of the time, followed by India until the 18th century.\n\n===Ming China===\n\nBy 1368, [[Zhu Yuanzhang]] had claimed himself [[Hongwu Emperor]] and established the Ming Dynasty of China. Immediately, the new emperor and his followers drove the Mongols and their culture out of China and beyond the Great Wall.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=503|loc=Chapter 22|quote=Immediately after he seized the throne, Zhu launched an effort to rid China of all traces of the \"barbarian\" Mongols. Mongol dress was discarded, Mongol names were dropped by those who had adopted them and were removed from buildings and court records, and Mongol palaces and administrative buildings in some areas were raided and sacked. The nomads themselves fled or were driven beyond the Great Wall, where military expeditions pursued them on several occasions.}} The new emperor was somewhat suspicious of the scholars that dominated China's bureaucracy, for he had been born a peasant and was uneducated.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=503|loc=Chapter 22|quote=Because the Hongwu emperor, like the founder of the earlier Han dynasty, was from a peasant family and thus poorly educated, he viewed the scholar-gentry with some suspicion.}} Nevertheless, Confucian scholars were necessary to China's bureaucracy and were reestablished as well as reforms that would improve the exam systems and make them more important in entering the bureaucracy than ever before. The exams became more rigorous, cut down harshly on cheating, and those who excelled were more highly appraised. Finally, Hongwu also directed more power towards the role of emperor so as to end the corrupt influences of the bureaucrats.\n\n====Society and economy====\nThe Hongwu emperor, perhaps for his sympathy of the common-folk, had built many irrigation systems and other public projects that provided help for the peasant farmers.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=504|loc=Chapter 22|quote=Perhaps because his lowly origins and personal suffering made him sensitive to the plight of the peasantry, Hongwu introduced measures that would improve the lot of the common people. Like most strong emperors, he promoted public works projects, including dike building and the extension of irrigation systems aimed at improving the farmers' yields.}} They were also allowed to cultivate and claim unoccupied land without having to pay any taxes and labor demands were lowered.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=504|loc=Chapter 22|quote=... Hongwu decreed that unoccupied lands would become the tax-exempt property of those who cleared and cultivated them. He lowered forced labor demands on the peasantry by both the government and members of the gentry class.}} However, none of this was able to stop the rising landlord class that gained many privileges from the government and slowly gained control of the peasantry. Moneylenders foreclosed on peasant debt in exchange for mortgages and bought up farmer land, forcing them to become the landlords' tenants or to wander elsewhere for work.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=505|loc=Chapter 22}} Also during this time, [[Neo-Confucianism]] intensified even more than the previous two dynasties (the Song and Yuan). Focus on the superiority of elders over youth, men over women, and teachers over students resulted in minor discrimination of the \"inferior\" classes. The fine arts grew in the Ming era, with improved techniques in brush painting that depicted scenes of court, city or country life; people such as scholars or travelers; or the beauty of mountains, lakes, or marshes. The Chinese novel fully developed in this era, with such classics written such as ''[[Water Margin]]'', ''[[Journey to the West]]'', and ''[[Jin Ping Mei]]''.\n\nEconomics grew rapidly in the Ming Dynasty as well. The introduction of American crops such as [[maize]], [[sweet potatoes]], and [[peanut]]s allowed for cultivation of crops in infertile land and helped prevent famine. The population boom that began in the Song dynasty accelerated until China's population went from 80 or 90 million to 150 million in three centuries, culminating in 1600.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=507|loc=Chapter 22|quote=By 1600 the population of China had risen to as many as 150 million from 80 to 90 million in the 14th century.}} This paralleled the market economy that was growing both internally and externally. Silk, tea, ceramics, and lacquer-ware were produced by artisans that traded them in Asia and to Europeans. Westerners began to trade (with some Chinese-assigned limits), primarily in the port-towns of [[Macau]] and [[Guangzhou|Canton]]. Although merchants benefited greatly from this, land remained the primary symbol of wealth in China and traders' riches were often put into acquiring more land.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=507|loc=Chapter 22|quote=Much of the merchants' wealth was invested in land rather than plowed back into trade or manufacturing, because land owning, not commerce, remained the surest route to social status in China.}} Therefore, little of these riches were used in private enterprises that could've allowed for China to develop the [[market economy]] that often accompanied the highly-successful Western countries.\n\n====Foreign interests====\n[[File:Fort St. George, Chennai.jpg|thumb|left|A view of the [[Fort St George]] in 18th-century [[Madras]].]]\nIn the interest of national glory, the Chinese began sending impressive [[Junk (ship)|junk]] ships across the [[South China Sea]] and the [[Indian Ocean]]. From 1403 to 1433, the [[Yongle Emperor]] commissioned [[Treasure voyages|expeditions]] led by the admiral [[Zheng He]], a Muslim [[eunuch]] from China. Chinese junks carrying hundreds of soldiers, goods, and animals for zoos, traveled to Southeast Asia, Persia, southern Arabia, and east Africa to show off Chinese power. Their prowess exceeded that of current Europeans at the time, and had these expeditions not ended, the world economy may be different from today.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=339|loc=Chapter 15|quote=There is no question that the course of world history might have been changed dramatically had the Chinese thrust continued, for the tiny European expeditions that began to creep down the western coast of Africa at about the same time would have been no match for this combination of merchant and military organization.}} In 1433, the Chinese government decided that the cost of a navy was an unnecessary expense. The Chinese navy was slowly dismantled and focus on interior reform and military defense began. It was China's longstanding priority that they protect themselves from nomads and they have accordingly returned to it. The growing limits on the Chinese navy would leave them vulnerable to foreign invasion by sea later on.\n\n[[File:Schall-von-bell.jpg|thumb|Here a Jesuit, Adam Schall von Bell (1592\u20131666), is dressed as an official of the Chinese Department of Astronomy.]]\n\nAs was inevitable, Westerners arrived on the Chinese east coast, primarily [[Jesuit]] missionaries which reached the mainland in 1582. They attempted to [[Jesuit China missions|convert the Chinese people to Christianity]] by first converting the top of the social hierarchy and allowing the lower classes to subsequently convert. To further gain support, many Jesuits adopted Chinese dress, customs, and language.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=508|loc=Chapter 22|quote=The Jesuits believed that the best way to convert a great civilization such as China was to adopt the dress, customs, language and manners of its elite.}} Some Chinese scholars were interested in certain Western teachings and especially in Western technology. By the 1580s, Jesuit scholars like [[Matteo Ricci]] and [[Adam Schall]] amazed the Chinese elite with technological advances such as European clocks, improved calendars and cannons, and the accurate prediction of eclipses.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=508|loc=Chapter 22|quote=Beginning in the 1580s, a succession of brilliant Jesuit scholars ... spent most of their time in the imperial city, correcting faulty calendars, forging cannons, fixing clocks imported from Europe, and astounding the Chinese scholar-gentry with the accuracy of their instruments and their ability to predict eclipses.}} Although some the scholar-gentry converted, many were suspicious of the Westerners whom they called \"barbarians\" and even resented them for the embarrassment they received at the hand of Western correction. Nevertheless, a small group of Jesuit scholars remained at the court to impress the emperor and his advisors.\n\n====Decline====\n[[Image:Batavia, C. de Jonghe (1740).jpg|thumb|left|Dutch Batavia in the 17th century, built in what is now [[North Jakarta]]]]\n\nNear the end of the 1500s, the extremely centralized government that gave so much power to the emperor had begun to fail as more incompetent rulers took the mantle. Along with these weak rulers came increasingly corrupt officials who took advantage of the decline. Once more the public projects fell into disrepair due to neglect by the bureaucracy and resulted in floods, drought, and famine that rocked the peasantry. The famine soon became so terrible that some peasants resorted to selling their children to slavery to save them from starvation, or to eating bark, the feces of geese, or [[Cannibalism|other people]].{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=509|loc=Chapter 22|quote=Peasants in afflicted districts were reduced to eating the bark from trees or the excrement of wild geese. Some peasants sold their children into slavery to keep them from starving, and peasants in some areas resorted to cannibalism.}} Many landlords abused the situation by building large estates where desperate farmers would work and be exploited. In turn, many of these farmers resorted to flight, banditry, and open rebellion.\n\nAll of this corresponded with the usual dynastic decline of China seen before, as well as the growing foreign threats. In the mid-16th century, Japanese and ethnic Chinese pirates began to raid the southern coast, and neither the bureaucracy nor the military were able to stop them.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=510|loc=Chapter 22|quote=One of the early signs of the seriousness of imperial deterioration was the inability of Chinese bureaucrats and military forces to put an end to the epidemic of Japanese (and ethnic Chinese) pirate attacks that ravaged the southern coast in the mid-16th century.}} The threat of the northern [[Manchu people]] also grew. The Manchu were an already large state north of China, when in the early 17th century a local leader named [[Nurhaci]] suddenly united them under the [[Eight Banners]]\u2014armies that the opposing families were organized into. The Manchus adopted many Chinese customs, specifically taking after their bureaucracy. Nevertheless, the Manchus still remained a Chinese [[vassal]]. In 1644 Chinese administration became so weak, the 16th and last emperor, the [[Chongzhen Emperor]], did not respond to the severity of an ensuing rebellion by local dissenters until the enemy had invaded the [[Forbidden City]] (his personal estate). He soon hanged himself in the imperial gardens.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=510|loc=Chapter 22|quote=By [1644], the administrative apparatus had become so feeble that the last Ming emperor, Chongzhen, did not realize how serious the rebel advance was until enemy soldiers were scaling the walls of the forbidden city. ... the ill-fated Chongzhen retreated to the imperial gardens and hanged himself rather than face capture.}} For a brief amount of time, the [[Shun Dynasty]] was claimed, until a loyalist Ming official called support from the Manchus to put down the new dynasty. The Shun Dynasty ended within a year and the Manchu were now within the Great Wall. Taking advantage of the situation, the Manchus marched on the Chinese capital of Beijing. [[Manchu conquest of China|Within two decades]] all of China belonged to the Manchu and the [[Qing Dynasty]] was established.\n\n==Late modern==\n{{further|Modern history#Late modern period}}\n\n===Qing China===\n{{Main|Qing Dynasty}}\n\nBy 1644, the northern [[Manchu people]] had conquered China and established a foreign dynasty\u2014the [[Qing Dynasty]]\u2014once more. The Manchu Qing emperors, especially Confucian scholar [[Kangxi Emperor|Kangxi]], remained largely conservative\u2014retaining the bureaucracy and the scholars within it, as well as the Confucian ideals present in Chinese society. However, changes in the economy and new attempts at resolving certain issues occurred too. These included increased trade with Western countries that brought large amounts of silver into the Chinese economy in exchange for tea, [[porcelain]], and silk textiles. This allowed for a new merchant-class, the [[comprador]]s, to develop. In addition, repairs were done on existing [[Levee|dikes]], canals, roadways, and [[irrigation]] works. This, combined with the lowering of taxes and government-assigned labor, was supposed to calm peasant unrest. However, the Qing failed to control the growing landlord class which had begun to exploit the peasantry and abuse their position.\n\nBy the late 18th century, both internal and external issues began to arise in Qing China's politics, society, and economy. The exam system with which scholars were assigned into the bureaucracy became increasingly corrupt; bribes and other forms of cheating allowed for inexperienced and inept scholars to enter the bureaucracy and this eventually caused rampant neglect of the peasantry, military, and the previously mentioned infrastructure projects. Poverty and banditry steadily rose, especially in rural areas, and mass migrations looking for work throughout China occurred. The perpetually conservative government refused to make reforms that could resolve these issues.\n\n====Opium War====\n{{Main|First Opium War}}\n\nChina saw its status reduced by what it perceived as parasitic trade with Westerners. Originally, European traders were at a disadvantage because the Chinese cared little for their goods, while European demand for Chinese commodities such as tea and porcelain only grew. In order to tip the trade imbalance in their favor, British merchants began to sell Indian [[opium]] to the Chinese. Not only did this sap Chinese bullion reserves, it also led to widespread drug addiction amongst the [[scholar official|bureaucracy]] and society in general. A ban was placed on opium as early as 1729 by the [[Yongzheng Emperor]], but little was done to enforce it. By the early 19th century, under the new [[Daoguang Emperor]], the government began serious efforts to eradicate opium from Chinese society. Leading this endeavour were respected scholar-officials including [[Imperial Commissioner (China)|Imperial Commissioner]] [[Lin Zexu]].\n\nAfter Lin [[Destruction of opium at Humen|destroyed more than 20,000 chests of opium]] in the summer of 1839, Europeans demanded compensation for what they saw as unwarranted Chinese interference in their affairs. When it was not paid, the British declared war later the same year, starting what became known as the [[First Opium War]]. The outdated Chinese [[Junk (ship)|junks]] were no match for the advanced British gunboats, and soon the [[Yangzi River]] region came under threat of British bombardment and invasion. The emperor had no choice but to sue for peace, resulting in the exile of Lin and the making of the [[Treaty of Nanking]], which ceded the British control of [[Hong Kong]] and opened up trade and diplomacy with other European countries, including Germany, France, and the USA.\n\n==Contemporary==\n{{further|Contemporary history}}\n[[File:Asia (late 19th century- early 20th century).jpg|thumb|380px|left|Map of Asia for early 20th century]]\n\nThe European powers had control of other parts of Asia by the early 20th century, such as [[British Raj|British India]], [[French Indochina]], [[Spanish East Indies]], and Portuguese [[Macau]] and [[Goa]]. The [[Great Game]] between Russia and Britain was the struggle for power in the Central Asian region in the nineteenth century. The [[Trans-Siberian Railway]], crossing Asia by train, was complete by 1916. Parts of Asia remained free from European control, although not influence, such as [[Persia]], [[Thailand]] and most of China. In the twentieth century, [[Imperial Japan]] expanded into China and Southeast Asia during the [[Second World War]]. After the war, many Asian countries became independent from European powers. During the [[Cold War]], the northern parts of Asia were communist controlled with the [[Soviet Union]] and People's Republic of China, while western allies formed pacts such as [[CENTO]] and [[SEATO]]. Conflicts such as the [[Korean War]], [[Vietnam War]] and [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]] were fought between communists and anti-communists. In the decades after the Second World War, a massive restructuring plan drove Japan to become the world's second-largest economy, a phenomenon known as the [[Japanese post-war economic miracle]]. The [[Arab\u2013Israeli conflict]] has dominated much of the recent history of the Middle East. After the [[Soviet Union]]'s collapse in 1991, there were many new independent nations in Central Asia.\n\n===China===\n{{main|History of the Republic of China|History of the People's Republic of China}}\nPrior to [[World War II]], China faced a civil war between [[Mao Zedong]]'s Communist party and [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s nationalist party; the nationalists appeared to be in the lead. However, once the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese invaded]] in 1937, the two parties were forced to form a temporary cease-fire in order to defend China. The nationalists faced many military failures that caused them to lose territory and subsequently, respect from the Chinese masses. In contrast, the communists' use of guerilla warfare (led by [[Lin Biao]]) proved effective against the Japanese's conventional methods and put the Communist Party on top by 1945. They also gained popularity for the reforms they were already applying in controlled areas, including land redistribution, education reforms, and widespread health care. For the next four years, the nationalists would be forced to retreat to the small island east of China, known as [[Taiwan]] (formerly known as Formosa), where they remain today. In mainland China, the [[People's Republic of China]] was established by the Communist Party, with [[Mao Zedong]] as its [[President of the People's Republic of China|state chairman]].\n\nThe communist government in China was defined by the party [[Professional revolutionaries|cadres]]. These hard-line officers controlled the [[People's Liberation Army]], which itself controlled large amounts of the bureaucracy. This system was further controlled by the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|Central Committee]], which additionally supported the state chairman who was considered the head of the government. The People's Republic's foreign policies included the repressing of [[secession]] attempts in Mongolia and Tibet and supporting of [[North Korea]] and [[North Vietnam]] in the [[Korean War]] and [[Vietnam War]], respectively. Additionally, by 1960 China began to cut off its connections with the Soviet Union due to border disputes and an increasing Chinese sense of superiority, especially the personal feeling of Mao over the Russian premier, [[Nikita Khrushchev]].\n\nToday China, India, South Korea, Japan and [[Russia]] play important roles in world economics and politics. China today is the world's second largest economy and the second fastest growing economy. Indian economy is the seventh-largest in the world by nominal GDP and the third-largest by purchasing power parity and is the fastest growing economy.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* {{Portal-inline|History of Asia}}\n* [[Ancient Asian history]]\n* [[History of Southeast Asia]]\n* [[List of historians]], inclusive of most major historians\n* {{slink|List of history journals|Asia}}\n* [[Prehistoric Asia]]\n* [[Naval history of World War II]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* \"Asia Reborn: A Continent Rises from the Ravages of Colonialism and War to a New Dynamism\" by Prasenjit K.

These groups are generally believed to have been isolated from peoples of the \"[[Old World]]\" until the coming of Europeans in the 10th century from Norway and with the [[voyages of Christopher Columbus]] in 1492.\n\nThe ancestors of today's [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indigenous peoples]] were the [[Paleo-Indians]]; they were [[hunter-gatherer]]s who migrated into North America. The most popular theory asserts that migrants came to the [[Americas]] via [[Beringia]], the land mass now covered by the ocean waters of the [[Bering Strait]]. Small [[lithic stage]] peoples followed [[megafauna]] like bison, mammoth (now extinct), and caribou, thus gaining the modern nickname \"big-game hunters.\" Groups of people may also have traveled into North America on shelf or sheet ice along the northern Pacific coast.\n\nCultural traits brought by the first immigrants later evolved and spawned such cultures as [[Iroquois]] on North America and [[Pirah\u00e3 people|Pirah\u00e3]] of South America. These cultures later developed into [[civilization]]s. In many cases, these cultures expanded at a later date than their Old World counterparts.

Spain colonized most of the Americas from present-day [[Southwestern United States]], [[Florida]] and the [[Caribbean]] to the southern tip of South America. Portugal settled in what is mostly present-day [[Brazil]] while England established colonies on the [[Thirteen Colonies|Eastern coast of the United States]], as well as the [[Northwestern United States|North Pacific coast]] and in most of [[Canada]]. France settled in [[Quebec]] and other parts of Eastern [[Canada]] and claimed an area in what is today the central United States. The Netherlands settled New Netherland (administrative centre New Amsterdam - now New York), some Caribbean islands and parts of Northern South America.\n\nEuropean colonization of the Americas led to the rise of new cultures, civilizations and eventually states, which resulted from the fusion of Native American and European traditions, peoples and institutions. The transformation of American cultures through colonization is evident in architecture, religion, gastronomy, the arts and particularly languages, the most widespread being [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (376 million speakers), [[English language|English]] (348 million) and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] (201 million). The colonial period lasted approximately three centuries, from the early 16th to the early 19th centuries, when [[Brazil]] and the larger [[Hispanic America]]n nations declared independence. The [[United States]] obtained independence from England much earlier, in 1776, while Canada formed a federal dominion in 1867. Others remained attached to their European parent state until the end of the 19th century, such as [[Cuba]] and [[Puerto Rico]] which were linked to Spain until 1898. Smaller territories such as [[Guyana]] obtained independence in the mid-20th century, while certain Caribbean islands and [[French Guiana]] remain part of a European power to this day.\n\n==Pre-colonization==\n{{main|Pre-Columbian era}}\n{{further|History of Canada|History of the United States|History of Mexico|History of Central America|History of South America}}\n\n===Migration into the continents===\n{{details|Settlement of the Americas}}\n{{details|topic=Native American genetic heritage|Genetic history of indigenous peoples of the Americas}}\n[[File:Spreading homo sapiens la.svg|thumb|320px|Map of [[early human migrations]]]] \nThe specifics of Paleo-Indian migration to and throughout the Americas, including the exact dates and routes traveled, are subject to ongoing research and discussion.<ref name=\"national\">{{cite web\n |title=Atlas of the Human Journey-The Genographic Project \n |publisher=National Geographic Society. \n |date=1996\u20132008 \n |url=https://genographic.nationalgeographic.com/genographic/atlas.html?era=e003 \n |accessdate=2009-10-06 \n |deadurl=yes \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501094643/https://genographic.nationalgeographic.com/genographic/atlas.html?era=e003 \n |archivedate=2011-05-01 \n |df= \n}}\n</ref> The traditional theory has been that these early migrants moved into the [[Beringia|Beringia land bridge]] between eastern Siberia and present-day Alaska around 40,000 \u2013 17,000 years ago, when sea levels were significantly lowered due to the [[Quaternary glaciation]].<ref name=\"national\"/><ref name=Smithsonian>{{cite web|first1=Drs.

The time period derives its name from the appearance of \"[[Lithic flake]]d\" stone tools. [[Stone tool]]s, particularly [[projectile point]]s and [[Scraper (archaeology)|scrapers]], are the primary evidence of the earliest well known human activity in the [[Americas]]. [[Lithic reduction]] stone tools are used by [[archaeologists]] and [[anthropologist]]s to classify cultural periods.\n\n===Archaic stage (8000 BCE \u2013 1000 BCE)===\n{{see also|Pre-Columbian era|History of Mesoamerica (Paleo-Indian)}}\nSeveral thousand years after the first migrations, the first complex civilizations arose as hunter-gatherers settled into semi-agricultural communities. Identifiable sedentary settlements began to emerge in the so-called Middle [[Archaic stage|Archaic period]] around 6000 BCE. Particular [[archaeological culture]]s can be identified and easily classified throughout the Archaic period.\n\nIn the late Archaic, on the north-central coastal region of Peru, a complex civilization arose which has been termed the [[Norte Chico civilization]], also known as Caral-Supe. It is the oldest known civilization in the Americas and one of the [[Cradle of civilization|five sites]] where civilization originated independently and indigenously in the ancient world, flourishing between the 30th and 18th centuries BC. It pre-dated the Mesoamerican [[Olmec]] civilization by nearly two millennia. It was contemporaneous with the Egypt following the unification of its kingdom under [[Narmer]] and the emergence of the first [[Egyptian hieroglyphics]].\n\nMonumental architecture, including earthwork platform mounds and sunken plazas have been identified as part of the civilization. Archaeological evidence points to the use of textile technology and the worship of common god symbols. Government, possibly in the form of theocracy, is assumed to have been required to manage the region. However, numerous questions remain about its organization. In archaeological nomenclature, the culture was pre-ceramic culture of the pre-Columbian Late Archaic period. It appears to have lacked ceramics and art.\n\nOngoing scholarly debate persists over the extent to which the flourishing of Norte Chico resulted from its abundant maritime food resources, and the relationship that these resources would suggest between coastal and inland sites.\n\nThe role of seafood in the Norte Chico diet has been a subject of scholarly debate. In 1973, examining the Aspero region of Norte Chico, [[Michael E. Moseley]] contended that a maritime subsistence (seafood) economy had been the basis of society and its early flourishing. This theory, later termed \"maritime foundation of Andean Civilization\" was at odds with the general scholarly consensus that civilization arose as a result of intensive grain-based agriculture, as had been the case in the emergence of civilizations in northeast Africa (Egypt) and southwest Asia (Mesopotamia).\n\nWhile earlier research pointed to edible domestic plants such as [[Squash (plant)|squash]], [[beans]], [[lucuma]], [[guava]], [[pacay]], and [[camote]] at Caral, publications by Haas and colleagues have added [[avocado]], [[Canna (plant)|achira]], and [[corn]] (Zea Mays) to the list of foods consumed in the region. In 2013, Haas and colleagues reported that maize was a primary component of the diet throughout the period of 3000 to 1800 BC.<ref name=HaasPNAS2013>{{cite journal | last1= Haas | first1= Jonathan | author2= Winifred Creamer, Luis Huam\u00e1n Mes\u00eda, David Goldstein, Karl Reinhard, and Cindy Vergel Rodr\u00edguez | year = 2013 | title = Evidence for maize (Zea mays) in the Late Archaic (3000\u20131800 B.C.) in the Norte Chico region of Peru |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 110 | issue = 13 |pages = 4945\u20134949 | doi= 10.1073/pnas.1219425110 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1073%2Fpnas.1219425110 |accessdate = 2013-11-20 | publisher = National Academy of Sciences of the United States |quote=New data drawn from coprolites, pollen records, and stone tool residues, combined with 126 radiocarbon dates, demonstrate that maize was widely grown, intensively processed, and constituted a primary component of the diet throughout the period from 3000 to 1800 B.C. | pmid=23440194 | pmc=3612639}}</ref>\n\n[[Cotton]] was another widespread crop in Norte Chico, essential to the production of fishing nets and textiles. Jonathan Haas noted a mutual dependency, whereby \"The prehistoric residents of the Norte Chico needed the fish resources for their protein and the fishermen needed the cotton to make the nets to catch the fish.\"\n\nIn the 2005 book ''[[1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus]]'', journalist Charles C. Mann surveyed the literature at the time, reporting a date \"sometime before 3200 BC, and possibly before 3500 BC\" as the beginning date for the formation of Norte Chico. He notes that the earliest date securely associated with a city is 3500 BC, at [[Huaricanga]] in the (inland) Fortaleza area.\n\nThe Norte Chico civilization began to decline around 1800 BC as more powerful centers appeared to the south and north along its coast, and to the east within the Andes Mountains.\n\n===Mesoamerica, the Woodland Period, and Mississippian culture (2000 BCE \u2013 500 CE)===\n{{see also|Indigenous peoples of the Americas|List of pre-Columbian cultures}} \n[[File:Ameicas 1000 BCE crop.png|thumb|240px|right|Simple map of subsistence methods in the Americas at 1000 BCE.\n{{legend|#FEFE00|[[hunter-gatherers]]}}\n{{legend|#00FE00|[[Agriculture|simple farming societies]]}}\n{{legend|#FE7334|complex farming societies (tribal [[chiefdom]]s or [[civilization]]s)}}\n]]\nAfter the decline of the Norte Chico civilization, several large, centralized civilizations developed in the Western Hemisphere: [[Chav\u00edn culture|Chavin]], [[Nazca]], [[Moche (culture)|Moche]], [[Huari culture|Huari]], [[Quitus]], [[Ca\u00f1ari]]s, [[Chimu]], [[Pachacamac]], [[Tiahuanaco]], [[Aymara people|Aymara]] and [[Inca]] in the Central [[Andes]] (Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia); [[Muisca people|Muisca]] in Colombia ; [[Ta\u00ednos]] in Dominican Republic (Hispaniola, Espa\u00f1ola) and part of Caribbean; and the [[Olmec]]s, [[Maya civilization|Maya]], [[Toltec]]s, [[Mixtec]]s, [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotecs]], [[Aztec]]s and [[Pur\u00e9pecha people|Purepecha]] in southern North America (Mexico, Guatemala).\n\nThe [[Olmec]] civilization was the first Mesoamerican civilization, beginning around 1600-1400 BC and ending around 400 BC. Mesoamerica is considered one of the [[Cradle of civilization|six sites]] around the globe in which civilization developed independently and indigenously. This civilization is considered the mother culture of the Mesoamerican civilizations. The Mesoamerican calendar, numeral system, writing, and much of the Mesoamerican pantheon seem to have begun with the Olmec.\n\nSome elements of agriculture seem to have been practiced in Mesoamerica quite early. The [[Maize#Origin|domestication of maize]] is thought to have begun around 7,500 to 12,000 years ago. The earliest record of lowland maize cultivation dates to around 5100 BC.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scienceblog.com/community/older/2003/I/20035654.html |title=Agriculture's origin may be hidden in 'invisible' clues |publisher=Scienceblog.com |date=2003-02-14 |accessdate=2009-04-18}}</ref> Agriculture continued to be mixed with a hunting-gathering-fishing lifestyle until quite late compared to other regions, but by 2700 BC, Mesoamericans were relying on maize, and living mostly in villages. Temple mounds and classes started to appear. By 1300/ 1200 BC, small centres coalesced into the Olmec civilization, which seems to have been a set of city-states, united in religious and commercial concerns. The Olmec cities had ceremonial complexes with earth/clay pyramids, palaces, stone monuments, aqueducts and walled plazas. The first of these centers was at San Lorenzo (until 900 bc). La Venta was the last great Olmec centre. Olmec artisans sculpted jade and clay figurines of Jaguars and humans. Their iconic giant heads - believed to be of Olmec rulers - stood in every major city.\n\nThe Olmec civilization ended in 400 BC, with the defacing and destruction of San Lorenzo and La Venta, two of the major cities. It nevertheless spawned many other states, most notably the Mayan civilization, whose first cities began appearing around 700-600 BC. Olmec influences continued to appear in many later Mesoamerican civilizations.\n\nCities of the Aztecs, Mayas, and Incas were as large and organized as the largest in the Old World, with an estimated population of 200,000 to 350,000 in [[Tenochtitlan]], the capital of the [[Aztec empire]]. The market established in the city was said to have been the largest ever seen by the [[conquistador]]s when they arrived. The capital of the Cahokians, [[Cahokia]], located near modern [[East St. Louis, Illinois]], may have reached a population of over 20,000. At its peak, between the 12th and 13th centuries, Cahokia may have been the most populous city in North America. [[Monk's Mound]], the major ceremonial center of Cahokia, remains the largest earthen construction of the prehistoric New World.\n\nThese civilizations developed agriculture as well, breeding [[maize]] (corn) from having ears 2\u20135&nbsp;cm in length to perhaps 10\u201315&nbsp;cm in length. [[Potato]]es, [[tomato]]es, [[pumpkin]]s, [[bean]]s, [[avocado]]s, and [[chocolate]] are now the most popular of the pre-Columbian agricultural products. The civilizations did not develop extensive livestock as there were few suitable species, although [[alpaca]]s and [[llama]]s were domesticated for use as beasts of burden and sources of wool and meat in the [[Andes]]. By the 15th century, maize was being farmed in the [[Mississippi River]] Valley after introduction from [[Mexico]]. The course of further agricultural development was greatly altered by the arrival of [[European ethnic groups|Europeans]].\n\n===Classic stage (800 BCE \u2013 1533 CE)===\n{{main|History of North America|History of Mexico|History of Central America|History of the Caribbean}}\n;Cahokia\n{{main|Cahokia}}\nCahokia was a major regional [[chiefdom]], with trade and tributary chiefdoms located in a range of areas from bordering the [[Great Lakes]] to the [[Gulf of Mexico]].\n\n;Haudenosaune\n{{main|Iroquois}}\nThe [[Iroquois|Iroquois League of Nations]] or \"People of the Long House\", based in present-day upstate and western [[New York (state)|New York]], had a [[Confederation|confederacy]] model from the mid-15th&nbsp;century.

For example, it is based on inherited rather than elected leadership, selected by female members of the tribes, consensus decision-making regardless of population size of the tribes, and a single group capable of bringing matters before the legislative body.<ref name=\"Tooker\"/>\n\nLong-distance trading did not prevent warfare and displacement among the indigenous peoples, and their oral histories tell of numerous migrations to the historic territories where Europeans encountered them. The Iroquois invaded and attacked tribes in the Ohio River area of present-day Kentucky and claimed the hunting grounds.

Tribes originating in the Ohio Valley who moved west included the [[Osage Nation|Osage]], [[Kaw people|Kaw]], [[Ponca]] and [[Omaha people]]. By the mid-17th century, they had resettled in their historical lands in present-day [[Kansas]], [[Nebraska]], [[Arkansas]] and [[Oklahoma]].

The name was adopted with a pejorative tone by the Spaniards when referring especially to the semi-nomadic [[hunter-gatherer]] peoples of northern Mexico.\n\n====Mesoamerica====\n{{main|Mesoamerica}}\n\n;Zapotec\nThe [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]] emerged around 1500 years BCE. Their writing system influenced the later Olmec. They left behind the great city [[Monte Alban]].\n\n;Olmec\nThe [[Olmec]] civilization emerged around 1200 BCE in [[Mesoamerica]] and ended around 400 BCE. Olmec art and concepts influenced surrounding cultures after their downfall. This civilization was thought to be the first in America to develop a writing system. After the Olmecs abandoned their cities for unknown reasons, the Maya, Zapotec and Teotihuacan arose.\n\n;Purepecha\nThe [[Pur\u00e9pecha people|Purepecha]] civilization emerged around 1000 CE in [[Mesoamerica]] . They flourished from 1100 CE to 1530 CE. They continue to live on in the state of [[Michoac\u00e1n]].

The [[Classic Maya collapse|Classic Maya]] may have collapsed due to changing climate in the end of the 10th century.\n\n;Toltec\nThe [[Toltec]] were a nomadic people, dating from the 10th - 12th century, whose language was also spoken by the Aztecs.\n\n;Teotihuacan\n[[Teotihuacan]] (4th century BCE - 7/8th century CE) was both a city, and an empire of the same name, which, at its zenith between 150 and the 5th century, covered most of Mesoamerica.\n\n;Aztec\nThe [[Aztec]] having started to build their empire around 14th century found their civilization abruptly ended by the Spanish conquistadors. They lived in Mesoamerica, and surrounding lands. Their capital city Tenochtitlan was one of the largest cities of all time.\n\n====South America====\n[[File:Inca Quipu.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Inca Quipu. [[Larco Museum|Larco Museum Collection.]]]]\n{{main|Pre-Columbian South America}}\n\n;Norte Chico\nThe oldest known civilization of the Americas was established in the [[Norte Chico (Peruvian region)|Norte Chico]] region of modern Peru. Complex society emerged in the group of coastal valleys, between 3000 and 1800 BCE. The [[Quipu]], a distinctive recording device among Andean civilizations, apparently dates from the era of Norte Chico's prominence.\n\n;Chav\u00edn\nThe [[Chav\u00edn]] established a trade network and developed agriculture by as early as (or late compared to the Old World) 900 BCE according to some estimates and archaeological finds. Artifacts were found at a site called Chav\u00edn in modern [[Peru]] at an elevation of 3,177 meters. Chav\u00edn civilization spanned from 900 BCE to 300 BCE.\n\n;[[Inca]]\nHolding their capital at the great city of [[Cusco]], the [[Inca civilization]] dominated the Andes region from 1438 to 1533.\nKnown as ''Tahuantinsuyu'', or \"the land of the four regions\", in [[Quechua languages|Quechua]], the Inca culture was highly distinct and developed. Cities were built with precise, unmatched stonework, constructed over many levels of mountain terrain. [[Terrace farming]] was a useful form of agriculture.

Speculations exist about other Old World discoveries of the New World, but none of these are generally or completely accepted by most scholars.\n\nSpain sponsored a major exploration led by Italian explorer [[Christopher Columbus]] in 1492; it quickly led to extensive [[European colonization of the Americas]]. The Europeans brought Old World diseases which are thought to have caused catastrophic epidemics and a huge decrease of the native population. Columbus came at a time in which many technical developments in sailing techniques and communication made it possible to report his voyages easily and to spread word of them throughout Europe. It was also a time of growing religious, imperial and economic rivalries that led to a competition for the establishment of colonies.\n\n===Colonial period===\n{{see also|Colonial history of the United States|Former colonies and territories in Canada}}\n15th to 19th century colonies in the New World:\n*[[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] (1492)\n*[[Viceroyalty of New Spain]] (1535 to 1821)\n*[[Viceroyalty of Peru]] (1542\u20131824)\n*[[Spanish Main]]\n*[[Spanish West Indies]]\n*[[Captaincy General of Guatemala]]\n*[[British America]] / [[Thirteen Colonies]] (1497/1584/1607 to 1776/20th century)\n*[[Danish West Indies]]\n*[[New Netherland]]\n*[[New France]]\n*[[Captaincy General of Venezuela]]\n*[[Portuguese colonization of the Americas]] (1499 to 1822)\n*[[Colonial Brazil]] (1500 to 1815)\n\n===Decolonization===\n{{details|Decolonization of the Americas}}\nThe formation of sovereign states in the New World began with the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] of 1776. The [[American Revolutionary War]] lasted through the period of the [[Siege of Yorktown]] \u2014 its last major campaign \u2014 in the early autumn of 1781, with peace being achieved [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|in 1783]].\n \nThe Spanish colonies won their independence in the first quarter of the 19th century, in the [[Spanish American wars of independence]]. [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] and [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]], among others, led their independence struggle. Although Bolivar attempted to keep the Spanish-speaking parts of Latin America politically allied, they rapidly became independent of one another as well, and several further wars were fought, such as the [[Paraguayan War]] and the [[War of the Pacific]]. (See [[Latin American integration]].) In the Portuguese colony [[Pedro I of Brazil|Dom Pedro I]] (also Pedro IV of Portugal), son of the Portuguese [[monarch|king]] [[Dom Jo\u00e3o VI]], proclaimed the country's independence in 1822 and became Brazil's first [[Emperor]]. This was peacefully accepted by the crown in Portugal, upon compensation.\n\n===Effects of slavery===\n{{further|Slavery in the Spanish New World colonies|Slavery in the British and French Caribbean|History of slavery in Brazil |Slavery in Canada|History of slavery in the United States}}\nSlavery has had a significant role in the economic development of the [[New World]] after the colonization of the Americas by the Europeans.

Canada bore the brunt of several major battles during the early stages of the war, including the use of [[Poison gas in World War I|poison gas]] attacks at [[Second Battle of Ypres|Ypres]]. Losses became grave, and the government eventually brought in [[conscription]], despite the fact this was against the wishes of the majority of [[French Canadians]]. In the ensuing [[Conscription Crisis of 1917]], riots broke out on the streets of [[Montreal]]. In neighboring Newfoundland, the new dominion suffered a devastating loss on July 1, 1916, the [[First day on the Somme]].\n\nThe United States stayed out of the conflict [[American entry into World War I|until 1917]], when it joined the Entente powers. The United States was then able to play a crucial role at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference of 1919]] that shaped [[interwar]] Europe. Mexico was not part of the war, as the country was embroiled in the Mexican Revolution at the time.\n\n{{further|Roaring Twenties|Great Depression|Cristero War}}\n\nThe 1920s brought an age of great prosperity in the United States, and to a lesser degree Canada. But the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] combined with [[dust bowl|drought]] ushered in a period of economic hardship in the United States and [[Great Depression in Canada|Canada]]. From 1936 to 1949, there was a popular uprising against the anti-Catholic Mexican government of the time, set off specifically by the anti-clerical provisions of the [[Mexican Constitution of 1917]].\n\n{{further|Military history of Canada during World War II|Military history of the United States during World War II|United States home front during World War II|SS Potrero del Llano|Faja de Oro|Escuadr\u00f3n 201}}\n\nOnce again, Canada found itself at war before its neighbors, however even Canadian contributions were slight before the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. The entry of the United States into the war helped to tip the balance in favour of the [[Allies of World War II|allies]]. Two Mexican tankers, transporting oil to the United States, were attacked and sunk by the Germans in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] waters, in 1942. The incident happened in spite of Mexico's neutrality at that time. This led Mexico to enter the conflict with a declaration of war on the Axis nations. The destruction of Europe wrought by the war vaulted all North American countries to more important roles in world affairs, especially the United States, which emerged as a \"[[superpower]]\".\n\n{{further|History of the United States (1945\u201364)|History of Canada (1945\u201360)|Civil rights movement}}\n\nThe early Cold War era saw the United States as the most powerful nation in a Western coalition of which Mexico and Canada were also a part. In Canada, Quebec was transformed by the [[Quiet Revolution]] and the emergence of [[Quebec nationalism]]. Mexico experienced an era of huge economic growth after World War II, a heavy industrialization process and a growth of its middle class, a period known in Mexican history as ''\"El Milagro Mexicano\"'' (the Mexican miracle). The Caribbean saw the beginnings of [[decolonization]], while on the largest island the [[Cuban Revolution]] introduced Cold War rivalries into Latin America.\n\n{{further|History of the United States (1964\u201380)|History of Canada (1960\u201381)}}\n\nThe [[civil rights movement]] in the U.S. ended [[Jim Crow]] and empowered black voters in the 1960s, which allowed black citizens to move into high government offices for the first time since Reconstruction. However, the dominant [[New Deal coalition]] collapsed in the mid 1960s in disputes over race and the [[Vietnam War]], and the conservative movement began its rise to power, as [[Modern liberalism in the United States|the once dominant liberalism weakened and collapsed]]. Canada during this era was dominated by the leadership of [[Pierre Elliot Trudeau]]. In 1982, at the end of his tenure, Canada enshrined a new constitution.\n\n{{further|History of the United States (1980\u201391)|History of Canada (1982\u201392)}}\n\nCanada's [[Brian Mulroney]] not only ran on a similar platform but also favored closer trade ties with the United States. This led to the [[Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement]] in January 1989. Mexican presidents [[Miguel de la Madrid]], in the early 1980s and [[Carlos Salinas de Gortari]] in the late 1980s, started implementing liberal economic strategies that were seen as a good move. However, Mexico experienced a strong economic recession in 1982 and the Mexican peso suffered a devaluation. In the United States president [[Ronald Reagan]] attempted to move the United States back towards a hard anti-communist line in foreign affairs, in what his supporters saw as an attempt to assert moral leadership (compared to the Soviet Union) in the world community. Domestically, Reagan attempted to bring in a package of [[privatization]] and [[regulation]] to stimulate the economy.\n\n{{further|History of the United States (1991\u2013present)|History of Canada (1992\u2013present)}}\n\nThe end of the Cold War and the beginning of the era of sustained economic expansion coincided during the 1990s. On January 1, 1994, Canada, Mexico and the United States signed the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]], creating the world's largest free trade area. In 2000, [[Vicente Fox]] became the first non-[[Partido Revolucionario Institucional|PRI]] candidate to win the Mexican presidency in over 70 years. The optimism of the 1990s was shattered by the [[9/11]] attacks of 2001 on the United States, which prompted military intervention in [[Afghanistan]], which also involved Canada. Canada did not support the United States' later move to [[Iraq War|invade Iraq]], however.\n\nIn the U.S. the [[Reagan Era]] of conservative national policies, deregulation and tax cuts took control with the election of [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1980. By 2010, political scientists were debating whether the election of [[Barack Obama]] in 2008 represented an end of the Reagan Era, or was only a reaction against the bubble economy of the 2000s (decade), which burst in 2008 and became the [[Late-2000s recession]] with prolonged unemployment.\n\n===Central America===\n<div style=\"float: right; margin: 0 0 1em 2em; width: 20em; text-align: right; font-size: 0.86em; font-family: lucida grande, sans-serif; line-height: normal;\"><!-- start of floated right section -->\n<div style=\"border: 1px solid #aaaaaa; background: #f9f9f9; text-align: left; padding: 0.5em 1em; text-align: center;\"><!-- start of slate grey box \n-->\n{| style=\"background: transparent; text-align: left; table-layout: auto; border-collapse: collapse; padding: 0; font-size: 100%;\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"\n! style=\"border-top: solid 1px #ccd2d9; padding: 0.4em 1em 0.4em 0; vertical-align: top; text-align: left;\" | Area\n| style=\"border-top: solid 1px #ccd2d9; padding: 0.4em 1em 0.4em 0; vertical-align: top\" | 560,988&nbsp;km\u00b2\n|-\n! style=\"border-top: solid 1px #ccd2d9; padding: 0.4em 1em 0.4em 0; vertical-align: top; text-align: left;\" | Population\n| style=\"border-top: solid 1px #ccd2d9; padding: 0.4em 1em 0.4em 0; vertical-align: top\" | 50,807,778\n|-\n! style=\"border-top: solid 1px #ccd2d9; padding: 0.4em 1em 0.4em 0; vertical-align: top; text-align: left;\" | Countries\n| style=\"border-top: solid 1px #ccd2d9; padding: 0.4em 1em 0.4em 0; vertical-align: top\" | {{BLZ}}<br />{{CRI}}<br />{{GUA}}<br />{{HND}}<br />{{NIC}}<br />{{PAN}}<br />{{SLV}}<br />{{DOM}}\n|-\n|}\n</div><!-- fin de la tabla flotante gris -->\n</div><!-- la secci\u00f3n inicia a partir de aqu\u00ed -->\n{{main|History of Central America}}\n{{see also|History of Belize|History of Costa Rica|History of El Salvador|History of Guatemala|History of Honduras|History of Nicaragua|History of Panama}}\nDespite the failure of a lasting political union, the concept of Central American reunification, though lacking enthusiasm from the leaders of the individual countries, rises from time to time. In 1856&ndash;1857 the region successfully established a military coalition to repel an invasion by United States adventurer [[William Walker (filibuster)|William Walker]]. Today, all five nations fly [[flag]]s that retain the old federal motif of two outer blue bands bounding an inner white stripe. (Costa Rica, traditionally the least committed of the five to regional integration, modified its flag significantly in 1848 by darkening the blue and adding a double-wide inner red band, in honor of the French tricolor).\n\nIn 1907, a [[Central American Court of Justice]] was created. On December 13, 1960, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua established the [[Central American Common Market]] (\"CACM\"). Costa Rica, because of its relative economic prosperity and political stability, chose not to participate in the CACM. The goals for the CACM were to create greater political unification and success of [[import substitution industrialization]] policies. The project was an immediate economic success, but was abandoned after the 1969 \"[[Football War]]\" between El Salvador and Honduras. A [[Central American Parliament]] has operated, as a purely advisory body, since 1991. Costa Rica has repeatedly declined invitations to join the regional parliament, which seats deputies from the four other former members of the Union, as well as from [[Panama]] and the [[Dominican Republic]].\n\n===South America===\n{{see also|History of South America}}\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, the governments of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Uruguay were overthrown or displaced by U.S.-aligned military dictatorships. These dictatorships detained tens of thousands of [[political prisoner]]s, many of whom were tortured and/or killed (on inter-state collaboration, see [[Operation Condor]]). Economically, they began a transition to [[neoliberal]] economic policies. They placed their own actions within the United States [[Cold War]] doctrine of \"National Security\" against internal subversion. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Peru suffered from an [[Internal conflict in Peru|internal conflict]] (see [[T\u00fapac Amaru Revolutionary Movement]] and [[Shining Path]]). Revolutionary movements and right-wing military dictatorships have been common, but starting in the 1980s a wave of democratization came through the continent, and democratic rule is widespread now. Allegations of corruption remain common, and several nations have seen crises which have forced the resignation of their presidents, although normal civilian succession has continued.\n\n[[Developing countries' debt|International indebtedness]] became a notable problem, as most recently illustrated by [[Argentina]]'s [[Argentine economic crisis (1999&ndash;2002)|default]] in the early 21st century. In recent years, South American governments have drifted to the left, with [[socialist]] leaders being elected in Chile, [[Bolivia]], Brazil, [[Venezuela]], and a leftist president in Argentina and [[Uruguay]]. Despite the move to the left, South America is still largely capitalist. With the founding of the [[Union of South American Nations]], South America has started down the road of economic integration, with plans for political integration in the [[European Union]] style.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\" style=\"font-size:100%\"\n|- style=\"background:#ececec;\"\n!

Some notable pre-colonial states and societies in Africa include the [[Ajuran Empire]], [[D'mt]], [[Adal Sultanate]], [[Warsangali Sultanate]], [[Kingdom of Nri]], [[Nok culture]], [[Mali Empire]], [[Songhai Empire]], [[Benin Empire]], [[Oyo Empire]], [[Ashanti Empire]], [[Ghana Empire]], [[Mossi Kingdoms]], [[Mutapa Empire]], [[Kingdom of Mapungubwe]], [[Kingdom of Sine]], [[Sennar (sultanate)|Kingdom of Sennar]], [[Kingdom of Saloum]], [[Kingdom of Baol]], Kingdom of [[Cayor]], [[Kingdom of Zimbabwe]], [[Kingdom of Kongo]], Empire of [[Kaabu]], Kingdom of [[Ile Ife]], [[Ancient Carthage]], [[Numidia]], [[Mauretania]], and the [[Aksumite Empire]].

One could say the Portuguese was part of it all in partnership with the European. That includes the triangular trade, with the Portuguese initially acquiring slaves through trade and later by force as part of the [[Atlantic slave trade]]. They transported enslaved [[West Africa|West]], [[Central Africa|Central]], and [[Southern Africa|Southern]] Africans overseas.<ref>http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/slavetrade.htm</ref> Subsequently, European colonization of Africa developed rapidly from around 10% (1870) to over 90% (1914) in the [[Scramble for Africa]] (1881-1914).  However following struggles for independence in many parts of the continent, as well as a weakened Europe after the [[Second World War]] {{nowrap|(1939 - 1945)}}, [[decolonization]] took place across the continent, culminating in the 1960 [[Year of Africa]].\n\nAfrica's pre-colonial history has been challenging to research, mostly due to the extreme lack of documentation, architecture and innovation that Europe and Asia have been so richly dense in for thousands of years. Disciplines such as the recording of [[oral history]], [[historical linguistics]], [[archaeology of Africa|archaeology]] and [[genetics]] have been crucial. Due to the African languages being exceedingly simple, low in syllable count and lacking overall complexity when Europeans first landed, attempting to translate words to English (or otherwise) was proven very difficult, however has been made easier to decipher today. \n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n{{Human history}}\n\n==Prehistory==\n{{Further information|Prehistoric North Africa|African archaeology}}\n\n===Paleolithic===\n{{Main article|Lower Paleolithic|Middle Stone Age|Later Stone Age}}\nThe first known [[Hominidae|hominids]] evolved in Africa. According to [[paleontology]], the early hominids' skull anatomy was similar to that of the [[gorilla]] and the [[chimpanzee]], [[great apes]] that also evolved in Africa, but the hominids had adopted a [[biped]]al locomotion which freed their hands. This gave them a crucial advantage, enabling them to live in both forested areas and on the open [[savanna]] at a time when Africa was drying up and the savanna was encroaching on forested areas. This would have occurred 10 to 5 million years ago, but these claims are controversial because biologists and genetics have humans appearing around the last 70 thousand to 200 thousand years.<ref>Shillington, Kevin (2005), ''History of Africa'', p. 2.

They were tool users, and makers of tools. They scavenged for meat and were omnivores.<ref>Shillington (2005), p. 2.</ref>\n\nBy approximately 3.3 million years ago, primitive stone tools were first used to scavenge kills made by other predators and to harvest carrion and marrow from their bones. In hunting, ''[[Homo habilis]]'' was probably not capable of competing with large predators and was still more prey than hunter. ''H. habilis'' probably did steal eggs from nests and may have been able to catch small [[game (food)|game]] and weakened larger prey (cubs and older animals). The tools were classed as [[Oldowan]].<ref name=\"Shillington 2005, p. 2-3\">Shillington (2005), p. 2-3.</ref>\n\nAround 1.8 million years ago, ''[[Homo ergaster]]'' first appeared in the fossil record in Africa. From ''Homo ergaster'', ''[[Homo erectus]]'' evolved 1.5 million years ago. Some of the earlier representatives of this species were still fairly small-brained and used primitive stone tools, much like ''H. habilis''. The brain later grew in size, and ''H. erectus'' eventually developed a more complex stone tool technology called the [[Acheulean]]. Possibly the first hunters, ''H. erectus'' mastered the art of making fire and was the first hominid to leave Africa, colonizing most of [[Afro-Eurasia]] and perhaps later giving rise to ''[[Homo floresiensis]]''. Although some recent writers have suggested that ''[[Homo georgicus]]'' was the first and primary hominid ever to live outside Africa, many scientists consider ''H. georgicus'' to be an early and primitive member of the ''H. erectus'' species.<ref>Shillington (2005), p. 3.</ref><ref>Ehret, Christopher (2002), ''The Civilizations of Africa'', p. 22.

By 13,000 to 11,000 BC, people began collecting wild grains. This spread to [[Western Asia]], which domesticated its wild grains, [[wheat]] and [[barley]]. Between 10,000 and 8000 BC, [[Northeast Africa]] was cultivating wheat and barley and raising sheep and cattle from Southwest Asia. A wet climatic phase in Africa turned the Ethiopian Highlands into a mountain forest. [[Omotic languages|Omotic speakers]] domesticated [[Ensete|enset]] around 6500\u20135500 BC. Around 7000 BC, the settlers of the Ethiopian highlands domesticated [[donkey]]s, and by 4000 BC domesticated donkeys had spread to Southwest Asia. [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]] speakers, partially turning away from cattle herding, domesticated [[teff]] and [[finger millet]] between 5500 and 3500 BC.<ref>Diamond, Jared (1997), ''Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies'', pp. 126\u2013127.</ref><ref>Ehret (2002), pp. 64\u201375, 80\u201381, 87\u201388.</ref>\n\nIn the [[steppe]]s and [[savanna]]hs of the [[Sahara]] and [[Sahel]] in Northern West Africa, the [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan speakers]] and [[Mand\u00e9 peoples]] started to collect and domesticate wild millet, [[African rice]] and [[sorghum]] between 8000 and 6000 BC. Later, [[gourd]]s, [[watermelon]]s, [[castor bean]]s, and [[cotton]] were also collected and domesticated. The people started capturing wild cattle and holding them in circular thorn hedges, resulting in [[domestication]].<ref>Ehret (2002), pp. 64\u201375.</ref> They also started making [[pottery]] and built stone settlements (see [[Tichitt]] and [[Oualata]]). [[Fishing]], using bone-tipped [[harpoon]]s, became a major activity in the numerous streams and lakes formed from the increased rains.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} Mande peoples have been credited with the independent development of agriculture about 3000\u20134000 BC.<ref>https://www.britannica.com/topic/Mande</ref>\n\nIn West Africa, the wet phase ushered in an expanding [[rainforest]] and wooded savanna from [[Senegal]] to [[Cameroon]]. Between 9000 and 5000 BC, [[Niger\u2013Congo languages|Niger\u2013Congo speakers]] domesticated the [[Elaeis guineensis|oil palm]] and [[raffia palm]]. Two seed plants, [[black-eyed pea]]s and [[voandzeia]] (African groundnuts), were domesticated, followed by [[okra]] and [[kola nut]]s. Since most of the plants grew in the forest, the Niger\u2013Congo speakers invented polished stone axes for clearing forest.<ref>Ehret (2002), pp. 82\u201384.</ref>\n\nMost of [[Southern Africa]] was occupied by [[pygmy peoples]] and [[Khoisan]] who engaged in hunting and gathering.

In the [[Horn of Africa]] the [[Kingdom of Aksum]] ruled modern-day [[Eritrea]], northern [[Ethiopia]] and the coastal area of the western part of the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. The Ancient Egyptians established ties with the [[Land of Punt]] in 2,350 BC.

The regions with the largest population pressure were in the [[Nile Delta]] region of [[Lower Egypt]], in [[Upper Egypt]], and also along the [[Cataracts of the Nile|second and third cataracts]] of the [[Dongola]] reach of the Nile in Nubia. This population pressure and growth was brought about by the cultivation of southwest Asian crops, including wheat and barley, and the raising of sheep, goats, and cattle. Population growth led to competition for farm land and the need to regulate farming. Regulation was established by the formation of [[Bureaucracy|bureaucracies]] among sacral chiefdoms. The first and most powerful of the chiefdoms was [[Ta-Seti]], founded around 3,500 BC. The idea of sacral chiefdom spread throughout Upper and Lower Egypt.<ref>Ehret (2002), pp. 143\u201346.</ref>\n\n[[File:All Gizah Pyramids.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The [[pyramids of Giza]], symbols of the civilization of ancient Egypt]]\nLater consolidation of the chiefdoms into broader political entities began to occur in Upper and Lower Egypt, culminating into the unification of Egypt into one political entity by [[Narmer]] ([[Menes]]) in 3,100 BC. Instead of being viewed as a sacral chief, he became a [[Imperial cult|divine king]]. The [[henotheism]], or worship of a single god within a polytheistic system, practiced in the sacral chiefdoms along Upper and Lower Egypt, became the polytheistic [[Ancient Egyptian religion]]. Bureaucracies became more centralized under the [[pharaoh]]s, run by [[Vizier (Ancient Egypt)|viziers]], governors, tax collectors, generals, artists, and technicians. They engaged in tax collecting, organizing of labor for major public works, and building irrigation systems, [[pyramid]]s, temples, and canals. During the [[Fourth Dynasty of Egypt|Fourth Dynasty]] (2,620\u20132,480\nBC), long distance trade was developed, with the [[Levant]] for timber, with Nubia for gold and skins, with [[Land of Punt|Punt]] for [[frankincense]], and also with the western Libyan territories. For most of the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]], Egypt developed her fundamental systems, institutions and culture, always through the central bureaucracy and by the divinity of the [[Pharaoh]].<ref>Davidson, Basil (1991), ''Africa In History: Themes and Outlines'', pp. 30\u201333.

By 2,200 BC, the Old Kingdom's stability was undermined by rivalry among the governors of the [[Nome (Egypt)|nomes]] who challenged the power of pharaohs and by invasions of Asiatics into the Nile Delta.

Connections with the southern regions of [[Kingdom of Kush|Kush]], Wawat and Irthet at the second cataract were made stronger. Then came the [[Second Intermediate Period of Egypt|Second Intermediate Period]], with the invasion of the [[Hyksos]] on horse-drawn [[chariot]]s and utilizing bronze weapons, a technology heretofore unseen in Egypt. Horse-drawn chariots soon spread to the west in the inhabitable Sahara and North Africa. The Hyksos failed to hold on to their Egyptian territories and were absorbed by Egyptian society. This eventually led to one of Egypt's most powerful phases, the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]] (1,580\u20131,080 BC), with the [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth Dynasty]]. Egypt became a [[superpower]] controlling Nubia and [[Judea]] while exerting political influence on the Libyans to the West and on the Mediterranean.<ref name=\"Davidson 1991, pp. 30-33\"/>\n\nAs before, the New Kingdom ended with invasion from the west by Libyan princes, leading to the [[Third Intermediate Period of Egypt|Third Intermediate Period]]. Beginning with [[Shoshenq I]], the [[Twenty-second Dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-second Dynasty]] was established. It ruled for two centuries.<ref name=\"Davidson 1991, pp. 30-33\"/>\n\nTo the south, Nubian independence and strength was being reasserted. This reassertion led to the conquest of Egypt by Nubia, begun by [[Kashta]] and completed by [[Piye]] (Pianhky, 751\u2013730 BC) and [[Shabaka]] (716\u2013695 BC). This was the birth of the [[Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt]]. The Nubians tried to re-establish Egyptian traditions and customs. They ruled Egypt for a hundred years. This was ended by an [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyrian]] invasion, with [[Taharqa]] experiencing the full might of Assyrian iron weapons. The Nubian pharaoh [[Tantamani]] was the last of the Twenty-fifth dynasty.<ref name=\"Davidson 1991, pp. 30-33\"/>\n\nWhen the Assyrians and Nubians left, a new [[Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-sixth Dynasty]] emerged from [[Sais, Egypt|Sais]]. It lasted until 525 BC, when Egypt was invaded by the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]]. Unlike the Assyrians, the Persians stayed. In 332, Egypt was conquered by [[Alexander the Great]]. This was the beginning of the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]], which ended with [[Egypt (Roman province)|Roman conquest]] in 30 BC.

Ta-Seti was a powerful sacral kingdom in the Nile Valley at the 1st and 2nd cataracts that exerted an influence over nearby chiefdoms based on pictorial representation ruling over [[Upper Egypt]]. Ta-Seti traded as far as [[Syro-Palestine]], as well as with Egypt. Ta-Seti exported gold, copper, ostrich feathers, [[ebony]] and [[ivory trade|ivory]] to the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]]. By the 32nd century BC, Ta-Seti was in decline. After the unification of Egypt by [[Narmer]] in 3,100 BC, Ta-Seti was invaded by the Pharaoh [[Hor-Aha]] of the [[First Dynasty of Egypt|First Dynasty]], destroying the final remnants of the kingdom.

Around the latter part of the third millennium, there was further consolidation of the sacral kingdoms. Two kingdoms in particular emerged: the Sai kingdom, immediately south of Egypt, and the [[Kingdom of Kerma]] at the third cataract. Sometime around the 18th century BC, the Kingdom of Kerma conquered the Kingdom of Sai, becoming a serious rival to Egypt. Kerma occupied a territory from the first cataract to the confluence of the [[Blue Nile]], [[White Nile]], and [[Atbarah River]]. About 1,575 to 1,550 BC, during the latter part of the [[Seventeenth Dynasty of Egypt|Seventeenth Dynasty]], the Kingdom of Kerma invaded Egypt.<ref>Alberge, Dalya. \"Tomb Reveals Ancient Egypt's Humiliating Secret\", ''The Times''{London}, 28 July 2003(Monday).</ref> The Kingdom of Kerma allied itself with the [[Hyksos]] invasion of Egypt.<ref>Ehret (2002), pp. 148\u2013151.</ref>\n\nEgypt eventually re-energized under the [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth Dynasty]] and conquered the Kingdom of Kerma or [[Kingdom of Kush|Kush]], ruling it for almost 500 years. The Kushites were Egyptianized during this period. By 1100 BC, the Egyptians had withdrawn from Kush. The region regained independence and reasserted its culture. Kush built a new religion around [[Amun]] and made [[Napata]] its spiritual center. In 730 BC, the Kingdom of Kush invaded Egypt, taking over [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] and beginning the Nubian Empire. The empire extended from [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] to the confluence of the Blue Nile, the White Nile, and River Atbara.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 40\u201341.</ref>\n\nIn 760 BC, the Kushites were expelled from Egypt by iron-wielding [[Assyria]]ns. Later, the administrative capital was moved from Napata to [[Mer\u00f6e]], developing a new Nubian culture. Initially, Meroites were highly Egyptianized, but they subsequently began to take on distinctive features. Nubia became a center of iron-making and cotton cloth manufacturing. Egyptian writing was replaced by the [[Meroitic alphabet]]. The lion god [[Apedemak]] was added to the Egyptian pantheon of gods. Trade links to the [[Red Sea]] increased, linking Nubia with Mediterranean [[Ancient Greece|Greece]]. Its architecture and art diversified, with pictures of lions, ostriches, giraffes, and elephants. Eventually, with the rise of [[Aksum]], Nubia's trade links were broken and it suffered environmental degradation from the tree cutting required for iron production. In 350 AD, the Aksumite king [[Ezana]] brought Mer\u00f6e to an end.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 42\u201345.</ref>\n\n===Carthage===\n{{main article|Ancient Carthage}}\n[[File:Carthaginianempire.PNG|thumb|250px|Carthaginian Empire]]\nThe Egyptians referred to the people west of the Nile, ancestral to the [[Berber people|Berbers]], as [[Ancient Libya|Libyans]]. The Libyans were agriculturalists like the [[Mauri (people)|Mauri]] of [[Morocco]] and the [[Numidians]] of central and eastern [[Algeria]] and [[Tunis]]. They were also nomadic, having the horse, and occupied the arid pastures and desert, like the [[Gaetuli]]. Berber desert nomads were typically in conflict with Berber coastal agriculturalists.<ref>Iliffe, John (2007), ''Africans: The History of a Continent'', p. 30. 2nd ed. New York:Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-521-68297-8}}.</ref>\n\nThe [[Phoenicia]]ns were Mediterranean [[Seaman|seamen]] in constant search for valuable metals such as copper, gold, tin, and lead. They began to populate the North African coast with settlements{{mdash}}trading and mixing with the native Berber population. In 814 BC, Phoenicians from [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] established the city of [[Carthage]]. By 600 BC, Carthage had become a major trading entity and power in the Mediterranean, largely through trade with tropical Africa. Carthage's prosperity fostered the growth of the Berber kingdoms, [[Numidia]] and [[Mauretania]]. Around 500 BC, Carthage provided a strong impetus for trade with [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. Berber middlemen, who had maintained contacts with Sub-Saharan Africa since the desert had desiccated, utilized pack animals to transfer products from oasis to oasis. Danger lurked from the [[Garamantes]] of [[Fes|Fez]], who raided caravans. Salt and metal goods were traded for gold, slaves, beads, and ivory.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 63\u201365.</ref>\n\n[[File:Ruines de Carthage.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Ruins of Carthage]]\nThe [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginians]] were rivals to the [[ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. Carthage fought the [[Punic Wars]], three wars with Rome: the [[First Punic War]] (264 to 241 BC), over [[Sicily]]; the [[Second Punic War]] (218 to 201 BC), in which [[Hannibal]] invaded Europe; and the [[Third Punic War]] (149 to 146 BC). Carthage lost the first two wars, and in the third it was destroyed, becoming the [[Africa (Roman province)|Roman province of Africa]], with the Berber Kingdom of Numidia assisting Rome. The Roman province of Africa became a major agricultural supplier of wheat, [[olive]]s, and [[olive oil]] to [[Roman Empire|imperial Rome]] via exorbitant taxation. Two centuries later, Rome brought the Berber kingdoms of Numidia and Mauretania under its authority. In the 420's AD, [[Vandal Kingdom|Vandals]] invaded North Africa and Rome lost her territories. The Berber kingdoms subsequently regained their independence.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 65.</ref>\n\n[[Christianity]] gained a foothold in Africa at [[Alexandria]] in the 1st century AD and spread to [[Maghreb|Northwest Africa]]. By 313 AD, with the [[Edict of Milan]], all of Roman North Africa was Christian. [[Egyptians]] adopted [[Monophysitism|Monophysite]] Christianity and formed the independent [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Church]]. Berbers adopted [[Donatism|Donatist]] Christianity. Both groups refused to accept the authority of the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]]. {{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n====Role of the Berbers====\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2011}}\nAs Carthaginian power grew, its impact on the indigenous population increased dramatically. [[Berber people|Berber]] civilization was already at a stage in which agriculture, manufacturing, trade, and political organization supported several states. Trade links between Carthage and the Berbers in the interior grew, but territorial expansion also resulted in the enslavement or military recruitment of some Berbers and in the extraction of tribute from others. By the early 4th century BC, Berbers formed one of the largest element, with Gauls, of the Carthaginian army. In the [[Revolt of the Mercenaries]], Berber soldiers participated from 241 to 238 BC after being unpaid following the defeat of Carthage in the [[First Punic War]]. Berbers succeeded in obtaining control of much of Carthage's North African territory, and they minted coins bearing the name Libyan, used in Greek to describe natives of North Africa. The Carthaginian state declined because of successive defeats by the Romans in the [[Punic Wars]]; in 146 BC the city of Carthage was destroyed. As Carthaginian power waned, the influence of Berber leaders in the hinterland grew. By the 2nd century BC, several large but loosely administered Berber kingdoms had emerged. Two of them were established in [[Numidia]], behind the coastal areas controlled by Carthage. West of Numidia lay Mauretania, which extended across the [[Moulouya River]] in Morocco to the Atlantic Ocean. The high point of Berber civilization, unequaled until the coming of the [[Almohad]]s and [[Almoravid dynasty]] more than a millennium later, was reached during the reign of [[Masinissa]] in the 2nd century BC. After Masinissa's death in 148 BC, the Berber kingdoms were divided and reunited several times. Masinissa's line survived until 24 AD, when the remaining Berber territory was annexed to the [[Roman Empire]].\n\n===Somalia===\n{{Further information|Maritime history of Somalia|History of Somalia}}\n[[File:Qableh1.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Ruins of [[Qa'ableh]], an early center of [[Somali people|Somali]] civilization]]\nThe ancestors of the [[Somali people]] were an important link in the [[Horn of Africa]] connecting the region's commerce with the rest of the ancient world.

The [[Roman emperor]] [[Trajan]] established a frontier in the south by encircling the Aur\u00e8s and [[Nemencha]] mountains and building a line of forts from Vescera (modern [[Biskra]]) to Ad Majores ([[Hennchir Besseriani]], southeast of Biskra). The defensive line extended at least as far as Castellum Dimmidi (modern [[Messa\u00e2d]], southwest of Biskra), Roman Algeria's southernmost fort. Romans settled and developed the area around Sitifis (modern [[S\u00e9tif]]) in the 2nd century, but farther west the influence of Rome did not extend beyond the coast and principal military roads until much later. {{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nThe Roman military presence of North Africa remained relatively small, consisting of about 28,000 troops and auxiliaries in [[Numidia]] and the two [[Mauretania]]n provinces. Starting in the 2nd century AD, these garrisons were manned mostly by local inhabitants.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nAside from [[Carthage]], urbanization in North Africa came in part with the establishment of settlements of veterans under the Roman emperors [[Claudius]] (reigned 41\u201354), [[Nerva]] (96\u201398), and [[Trajan]] (98\u2013117). In Algeria such settlements included [[Tipasa]], Cuicul or Curculum (modern [[Dj\u00e9mila|Djemila]], northeast of S\u00e9tif), Thamugadi (modern [[Timgad]], southeast of S\u00e9tif), and Sitifis (modern S\u00e9tif). The prosperity of most towns depended on [[agriculture]]. Called the \"granary of the empire\", North Africa became one of the largest exporters of grain in the empire, shipping to the provinces which did not produce cereals, like [[Roman Italy|Italy]] and [[Roman Greece|Greece]]. Other crops included fruit, figs, grapes, and beans. By the 2nd century AD, olive oil rivaled cereals as an export item.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nThe beginnings of the [[Historiography of the fall of the Western Roman Empire|Roman imperial decline]] seemed less serious in North Africa than elsewhere. However, uprisings did take place. In 238 AD, landowners rebelled unsuccessfully against imperial fiscal policies. Sporadic tribal revolts in the Mauretanian mountains followed from 253 to 288, during the [[Crisis of the Third Century]]. The towns also suffered economic difficulties, and building activity almost ceased.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nThe towns of Roman North Africa had a substantial [[History of the Jews in the Roman Empire|Jewish population]]. Some Jews had been deported from [[Judea]] or [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] in the 1st and 2nd centuries AD for rebelling against Roman rule; others had come earlier with [[Punics|Punic]] settlers. In addition, a number of Berber tribes had converted to [[Judaism]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nChristianity arrived in the 2nd century and soon gained converts in the towns and among slaves. More than eighty bishops, some from distant frontier regions of Numidia, attended the [[Council of Carthage (256)]] in 256. By the end of the 4th century, the settled areas had become [[Christianization|Christianized]], and some Berber tribes had converted ''en masse''.{{cn|date=April 2018}}\n\nA division in the church that came to be known as the [[Donatism|Donatist]] [[heresy]] began in 313 among [[Christian]]s in North Africa. The Donatists stressed the holiness of the church and refused to accept the authority to administer the sacraments of those who had surrendered the scriptures when they were forbidden under the Emperor [[Diocletian]] (reigned 284\u2013305). The Donatists also opposed the involvement of [[Constantine the Great]] (reigned 306\u2013337) in church affairs in contrast to the majority of Christians who welcomed official imperial recognition.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nThe occasionally violent Donatist controversy has been characterized{{by whom|date=December 2013}} as a struggle between opponents and supporters of the Roman system. The most articulate North African critic of the Donatist position, which came to be called a heresy, was [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], bishop of [[Hippo Regius]]. Augustine maintained that the unworthiness of a minister did not affect the validity of the sacraments because their true minister was [[Jesus]] [[Christ]]. In his sermons and books Augustine, who is considered a leading exponent of Christian dogma, evolved a theory of the right of orthodox Christian rulers to use force against schismatics and heretics. Although the dispute was resolved by a decision of an imperial commission in Carthage in 411, Donatist communities continued to exist as late as the 6th century.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nA decline in trade weakened Roman control.

Local opposition delayed full Byzantine control of the region for twelve years, however, and when imperial control came, it was but a shadow of the control exercised by Rome. Although an impressive series of fortifications were built, Byzantine rule was compromised by official corruption, incompetence, military weakness, and lack of concern in Constantinople for African affairs, which made it an easy target for the Arabs during the [[Early Muslim conquests]] .

D'mt traded through the [[Red Sea]] with Egypt and the Mediterranean, providing frankincense. By the 5th and 3rd centuries, D'mt had declined, and several successor states took its place. Later there was greater trade with [[South Arabia]], mainly with the port of [[Sabaeans|Saba]]. [[Adulis]] became an important commercial center in the [[Ethiopian Highlands]]. The interaction of the peoples in the two regions, the southern Arabia [[Sabaeans]] and the northern Ethiopians, resulted in the [[Ge'ez]] culture and language and eventual development of the [[Ge'ez script]]. Trade links increased and expanded from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean, with Egypt, Greece, and Rome, to the [[Black Sea]], and to [[Persia]], India, and China. Aksum was known throughout those lands. By the 5th century BC, the region was very prosperous, exporting ivory, hippopotamus hides, gold dust, spices, and live elephants. It imported silver, gold, olive oil, and wine. Aksum manufactured glass crystal, brass, and copper for export. A powerful Aksum emerged, unifying parts of eastern Sudan, northern Ethiopia ([[Tigray Region|Tigre]]), and [[Eritrea]]. Its kings built stone palatial buildings and were buried under megalithic monuments. By 300 AD, Aksum was minting its own coins in silver and gold.<ref>Collins, Robert O., and James M.

At the end of the 6th century, the [[Sasanian Empire]] pushed Aksum out of the peninsula. With the spread of [[Islam]] through [[Western Asia]] and Northern Africa, Aksum's trading networks in the Mediterranean faltered. The Red Sea trade diminished as it was diverted to the [[Persian Gulf]] and dominated by [[Arabs]], causing Aksum to decline.

Symbiotic trade relations developed before the [[trans-Saharan trade]], in response to the opportunities afforded by north-south diversity in ecosystems across deserts, grasslands, and forests. The agriculturists received salt from the desert nomads. The desert nomads acquired meat and other foods from pastoralists and farmers of the grasslands and from fishermen on the [[Niger River]].

Kanem arose by engaging in the trans-Saharan trade. It exchanged slaves captured by raiding the south for horses from North Africa, which in turn aided in the acquisition of slaves. By the late 11th century, the Islamic [[Sayfawa Dynasty|Sayfawa (Saifawa) dynasty]] was founded by [[Hummay|Humai (Hummay) ibn Salamna]]. The Sayfawa Dynasty ruled for 771 years, making it one of the longest-lasting dynasties in human history.<ref name=\"Burns 2007 pp. 88-89\"/> In addition to trade, taxation of local farms around Kanem became a source of state income. Kanem reached its peak under ''Mai'' (king) [[Dunama Dabbalemi|Dunama Dibalemi ibn Salma]] (1210\u20131248). The empire reportedly was able to field 40,000 cavalry, and it extended from [[Fezzan]] in the north to the [[Sao civilisation|Sao]] state in the south.

The authority of the ''balopwe'' resided in his spiritual power rather than his military authority. The army was relatively small. The Luba was able to control regional trade and collect tribute for redistribution. Numerous offshoot states were formed with founders claiming descent from the Luba. The Luba political system spread throughout [[Central Africa]], southern [[Uganda]], [[Rwanda]], [[Burundi]], [[Malawi]], [[Zambia]], [[Zimbabwe]], and the western Congo.

Slave trading increased with Afonso's wars of conquest. About 1568 to 1569, the [[Jaga (people)|Jaga]] invaded Kongo, laying waste to the kingdom and forcing the ''manikongo'' into exile. In 1574, Manikongo [[\u00c1lvaro I of Kongo|\u00c1lvaro I]] was reinstated with the help of Portuguese mercenaries. During the latter part of the 1660s, the Portuguese tried to gain control of Kongo. Manikongo [[Ant\u00f3nio I of Kongo|Ant\u00f3nio I]] (1661\u20131665), with a Kongolese army of 5,000, was destroyed by an army of Afro-Portuguese at the [[Battle of Mbwila]].

Ndongo was ruled by the ''ngola''. Ndongo would also engage in slave trading with the Portuguese, with [[S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9]] being a transit point to Brazil. The kingdom was not as welcoming as Kongo; it viewed the Portuguese with great suspicion and as an enemy. The Portuguese in the latter part of the 16th century tried to gain control of Ndongo but were defeated by the [[Northern Mbundu people|Mbundu]]. Ndongo experienced depopulation from slave raiding. The leaders established another state at [[Kingdom of Matamba|Matamba]], affiliated with [[Nzinga of Ndongo and Matamba|Queen Nzinga]], who put up a strong resistance to the Portuguese until coming to terms with them. The Portuguese settled along the coast as trade dealers, not venturing on conquest of the interior. Slavery wreaked havoc in the interior, with states initiating wars of conquest for captives. The [[Imbangala]] formed the slave-raiding state of [[Kasanje Kingdom|Kasanje]], a major source of slaves during the 17th and 18th centuries.<ref>Shillington (2005), p. 198, 199.</ref><ref>Davidson (1991), p. 158.</ref>\n\n===Horn of Africa===\n\n====Somalia====\n[[File:Gondereshe2008.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Citadel]] of [[Gondershe|Gondershe, Somalia]] was an important city in the medieval [[Somali people|Somali]] [[Ajuran Sultanate|Ajuran Empire]]]]\n\nThe [[History of Islam|birth of Islam]] opposite Somalia's Red Sea coast meant that Somali merchants and sailors living on the [[Arabian Peninsula]] gradually came under the influence of the new religion through their converted [[Arab]] Muslim trading partners.

Conflict arose as to who should be the successor of the prophet. The [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]]s had initially taken control of the [[Caliphate]], with their capital at [[Damascus]]. Later, the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]]s had taken control, moving the capital to [[Baghdad]]. The [[Berber people]], being independent in spirit and hostile to outside interference in their affairs and to [[Arab]] exclusivity in orthodox Islam, adopted [[Shia Islam|Shi'ite]] and [[Kharijites|Kharijite]] Islam, both considered unorthodox and hostile to the authority of the Abbasid Caliphate. Numerous Kharijite kingdoms came and fell during the 8th and 9th centuries, asserting their independence from Baghdad. In the early 10th century, Shi'ite groups from Syria, claiming descent from Muhammad's daughter [[Fatimah]], founded the [[Fatimid Dynasty]] in the [[Maghreb]]. By 950, they had conquered all of the Maghreb and by 969 all of Egypt. They had immediately broken away from Baghdad.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 75, 76.</ref>\n\nIn an attempt to bring about a purer form of Islam among the [[Zenaga people|Sanhaja]] Berbers, [[Abdallah ibn Yasin]] founded the [[Almoravid dynasty|Almoravid]] movement in present-day [[Mauritania]] and [[Western Sahara]]. The Sanhaja Berbers, like the [[Soninke people|Soninke]], practiced an indigenous religion alongside Islam. Abdallah ibn Yasin found ready converts in the [[Lamtuna]] Sanhaja, who were dominated by the Soninke in the south and the [[Zenata]] Berbers in the north. By the 1040s, all of the Lamtuna was converted to the Almoravid movement. With the help of Yahya ibn Umar and his brother [[Abu-Bakr Ibn-Umar|Abu Bakr ibn Umar]], the sons of the Lamtuna chief, the Almoravids created an empire extending from the Sahel to the Mediterranean. After the death of Abdallah ibn Yassin and Yahya ibn Umar, Abu Bakr split the empire in half, between himself and [[Yusuf ibn Tashfin]], because it was too big to be ruled by one individual. Abu Bakr took the south to continue fighting the Soninke, and Yusuf ibn Tashfin took the north, expanding it to southern Spain. The death of Abu Bakr in 1087 saw a breakdown of unity and increase military dissension in the south. This caused a re-expansion of the Soninke. The Almoravids were once held responsible for bringing down the [[Ghana Empire]] in 1076, but this view is no longer credited.<ref>Shillington, Kevin (2005). p 90.</ref>\n\n[[File:Safi minaret.png|thumb|left|250px|The Almohad minaret in Safi]]\n\nDuring the 10th through 13th centuries, there was a large-scale movement of [[bedouin]]s out of the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. About 1050, a quarter of a million Arab nomads from Egypt moved into the Maghreb. Those following the northern coast were referred to as [[Banu Hilal]]. Those going south of the [[Atlas Mountains]] were the [[Banu Sulaym]]. This movement spread the use of the [[Arabic language]] and hastened the decline of the [[Berber languages|Berber language]] and the [[Arabization|Arabisation]] of North Africa. Later an Arabised Berber group, the Hawwara, went south to Nubia via Egypt.<ref>Shillington, Kevin (2005), pp. 156, 157</ref>\n\nIn the 1140s, [[Abd al-Mu'min]] declared [[jihad]] on the [[Almoravids]], charging them with decadence and corruption. He united the northern Berbers against the Almoravids, overthrowing them and forming the [[Almohad dynasty|Almohad]] Empire. During this period, the Maghreb became thoroughly [[Islamization|Islamised]] and saw the spread of [[literacy]], the development of [[algebra]], and the use of the number [[0 (number)|zero]] and [[decimal]]s. By the 13th century, the Almohad states had split into three rival states. Muslim states were largely extinguished in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] by the Christian kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]], and [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]]. Around 1415, Portugal engaged in a ''[[reconquista]]'' of North Africa by capturing [[Ceuta]], and in later centuries Spain and Portugal acquired other ports on the North African coast. In 1492, at the end of the [[Granada War]], Spain defeated Muslims in the [[Emirate of Granada]], effectively ending eight centuries of Muslim domination in southern Iberia.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 88\u201392.</ref>\n\nPortugal and Spain took the ports of [[Tangiers]], [[Algiers]], [[Tripoli]], and [[Tunis]]. This put them in direct competition with the [[Ottoman Empire]], which re-took the ports using Turkish corsairs ([[Piracy|pirates]] and [[privateer]]s). The Turkish corsairs would use the ports for raiding Christian ships, a major source of booty for the towns. Technically, North Africa was under the control of the Ottoman Empire, but only the coastal towns were fully under [[Istanbul]]'s control. Tripoli benefited from trade with [[Borno State|Borno]]. The [[pashas]] of Tripoli traded horses, firearms, and armor via Fez with the sultans of the [[Bornu Empire]] for slaves.<ref>Shillington, Kevin (2005), pp. 166,167</ref>\n\nIn the 16th century, an Arab nomad tribe that claimed descent from Muhammad's daughter, the [[Saadi dynasty|Saadis]], conquered and united [[Morocco]]. They prevented the Ottoman Empire from reaching to the Atlantic and expelled Portugal from Morocco's western coast. [[Ahmad al-Mansur]] brought the state to the height of its power. He invaded [[Songhai Empire|Songhay]] in 1591, to control the gold trade, which had been diverted to the western coast of Africa for European ships and to the east, to Tunis. Morocco's hold on Songhay diminished in the 17th century. In 1603, after Ahmad's death, the kingdom split into the two sultanates of [[Fes]] and [[Marrakesh]]. Later it was reunited by [[Al-Rashid of Morocco|Moulay al-Rashid]], founder of the [[Alaouite Dynasty]] (1672\u20131727). His brother and successor, [[Ismail ibn Sharif]](1672\u20131727), strengthened the unity of the country by importing slaves from the Sudan to build up the military.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 167\u2013168.</ref>\n\n====Nile Valley====\n\n=====Egypt=====\n{{Further information|Lists of rulers of Egypt}}\n[[File:Fatimid Caliphate.PNG|thumb|right|250px|Fatimid Caliphate]]\n\nIn 642 AD, the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] conquered [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|Byzantine Egypt]].<ref name=\"Shillington 2005 pp. 65-67\"/>\n\nEgypt under the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] was prosperous. Dams and canals were repaired, and wheat, barley, flax, and cotton production increased. Egypt became a major producer of linen and cotton cloth. Its Mediterranean and Red Sea trade increased. Egypt also minted a gold currency called the Fatimid dinar, which was used for international trade. The bulk of revenues came from taxing the [[fellah]]in ([[peasant]] farmers), and taxes were high. Tax collecting was leased to [[Berber people|Berber]] overlords, who were soldiers who had taken part in the Fatimid conquest in 969 AD. The overlords paid a share to the caliphs and retained what was left. Eventually, they became landlords and constituted a settled land aristocracy.<ref>Shillington, Kevin (2005), p. 157.</ref>\n\nTo fill the military ranks, [[Mamluk]] Turkish slave cavalry and Sudanese slave infantry were used. Berber freemen were also recruited. In the 1150s, tax revenues from farms diminished. The soldiers revolted and wreaked havoc in the countryside, slowed trade, and diminished the power and authority of the Fatimid caliphs.<ref>Shillington (2005), p. 158.</ref>\n\nDuring the 1160s, Fatimid Egypt came under threat from [[Crusades|European crusaders]]. Out of this threat, a [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] general named [[Saladin|\u1e62al\u0101\u1e25 ad-D\u012bn Y\u016bsuf ibn Ayy\u016bb]] (Saladin), with a small band of professional soldiers, emerged as an outstanding Muslim defender. Saladin defeated the Christian crusaders at Egypt's borders and [[Siege of Jerusalem (1187)|recaptured Jerusalem]] in 1187. On the death of [[Al-Adid]], the last Fatimid caliph, in 1171, Saladin became the ruler of Egypt, ushering in the [[Ayyubid Dynasty]]. Under his rule, Egypt returned to [[Sunni Islam]], [[Cairo]] became an important center of Arab Islamic learning, and Mamluk slaves were increasingly recruited from Turkey and southern Russia for military service. Support for the military was tied to the ''iqta'', a form of land taxation in which soldiers were given ownership in return for military service.<ref>Shillington, Kevin (2005), pp. 158,159</ref>\n\nOver time, Mamluk slave soldiers became a very powerful [[landed nobility|landed aristocracy]], to the point of getting rid of the Ayyubid dynasty in 1250 and establishing a [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk dynasty]]. The more powerful Mamluks were referred to as ''[[Emir|amirs]]''. For 250 years, Mamluks controlled all of Egypt under a military dictatorship. Egypt extended her territories to Syria and Palestine, thwarted the crusaders, and halted a [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] invasion in 1260 at the [[Battle of Ain Jalut]]. Mamluk Egypt came to be viewed as a protector of Islam, and of [[Medina]] and [[Mecca]]. Eventually the ''iqta'' system declined and proved unreliable for providing an adequate military. The Mamluks started viewing their ''iqta'' as hereditary and became attuned to urban living. Farm production declined, and dams and canals lapsed into disrepair. Mamluk military skill and technology did not keep pace with new technology of [[handgun]]s and [[cannon]]s.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 159\u2013161.</ref>\n\nWith the rise of the [[Ottoman Empire]], Egypt was easily defeated. In 1517, at the end of an [[Ottoman\u2013Mamluk War (1516\u201317)|Ottoman\u2013Mamluk War]], Egypt became part of the Ottoman Empire. The [[Istanbul]] government revived the ''iqta'' system. Trade was reestablished in the Red Sea, but it could not completely connect with the [[Indian Ocean]] trade because of growing Portuguese presence. During the 17th and 18th centuries, hereditary Mamluks regained power. The leading Mamluks were referred to as ''[[bey]]s''. [[Pasha]]s, or viceroys, represented the Istanbul government in name only, operating independently. During the 18th century, dynasties of pashas became established. The government was weak and corrupt.<ref>Shillington (2005), p. 161.</ref>\n\nIn 1798, [[Napoleon]] [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|invaded Egypt]]. The local forces had little ability to resist the French conquest. However, the [[British Empire]] and the Ottoman Empire were able to remove French occupation in 1801. These events marked the beginning of a 19th-century Anglo-Franco rivalry over Egypt.<ref>Shillington (2005), p. 162.</ref>\n\n=====Sudan=====\n\n====Christian and Islamic Nubia====\n{{Further information|List of rulers of Makuria}}\n[[File:Christian Nubia.png|thumb|right|250px|Christian Nubia and the Nile [[cataract]]s]]\nAfter [[Ezana of Axum|Ezana of Aksum]] sacked [[Meroe]], people associated with the site of [[Ballana]] moved into [[Nubia]] from the southwest and founded three kingdoms: [[Kingdom of Makuria|Makuria]], [[Nobatia]], and [[Alodia]]. They would rule for 200 years. Makuria was above the [[Cataracts of the Nile|third cataract]], along the Dongola Reach with its capital at [[Dongola]]. Nobadia was to the north with its capital at [[Faras]], and [[Alodia]] was to the south with its capital at [[Soba (city)|Soba]]. Makuria eventually absorbed Nobadia. The people of the region converted to [[Monophysitism|Monophysite Christianity]] around 500 to 600 CE. The church initially started writing in [[Coptic language|Coptic]], then in [[Greek language|Greek]], and finally in [[Old Nubian language|Old Nubian]], a [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]] language. The church was aligned with the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Egyptian Coptic Church]].<ref>Shillington (2005), p. 67</ref><ref>Ehret (2002), p. 305.</ref>\n\nBy 641, [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|Egypt was conquered]] by the [[Rashidun Caliphate]]. This effectively blocked Christian Nubia and Aksum from Mediterranean Christendom. In 651\u2013652, Arabs from Egypt invaded Christian Nubia. Nubian archers soundly defeated the invaders. The [[Bakt|Baqt (or Bakt) Treaty]] was drawn, recognizing Christian Nubia and regulating trade. The treaty controlled relations between Christian Nubia and Islamic Egypt for almost six hundred years.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 77.</ref>\n\nBy the 13th century, Christian Nubia began its decline. The authority of the monarchy was diminished by the church and nobility. Arab [[bedouin]] tribes began to infiltrate Nubia, causing further havoc. ''[[Fakir]]s'' (holy men) practicing [[Sufism]] introduced Islam into Nubia. By 1366, Nubia had become divided into petty fiefdoms when it was invaded by [[Mamluk]]s. During the 15th century, Nubia was open to Arab immigration. Arab nomads intermingled with the population and introduced the [[Arab culture]] and the [[Arabic]] language. By the 16th century, [[Makuria]] and [[Nobadia]] had been [[Islamization|Islamized]]. During the 16th century, Abdallah Jamma headed an Arab confederation that destroyed Soba, capital of Alodia, the last holdout of Christian Nubia. Later Alodia would fall under the [[Sennar (sultanate)|Funj Sultanate]].<ref>Collins and Burns 2007, p. 77.</ref>\n\nDuring the 15th century, [[Funj people|Funj]] herders migrated north to [[Alodia]] and occupied it. Between 1504 and 1505, the kingdom expanded, reaching its peak and establishing its capital at [[Sennar]] under [[Badi II|Badi II Abu Daqn]] (c. 1644\u20131680). By the end of the 16th century, the Funj had converted to Islam. They pushed their empire westward to [[Kurdufan|Kordofan]]. They expanded eastward, but were halted by Ethiopia. They controlled Nubia down to the 3rd Cataract. The economy depended on captured enemies to fill the army and on merchants travelling through Sennar. Under [[Badi IV]] (1724\u20131762), the army turned on the king, making him nothing but a figurehead. In 1821, the Funj were conquered by [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]] (1805\u20131849), Pasha of Egypt.<ref>Page, Willie F.(2001).

The state arose in the 12th century CE. Its wealth came from controlling the trade in ivory from the [[Limpopo River|Limpopo Valley]], copper from the mountains of northern [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]], and gold from the [[Zimbabwe]] Plateau between the Limpopo and [[Zambezi River|Zambezi]] rivers, with the [[Swahili people|Swahili]] merchants at [[Chibuene]]. By the mid-13th century, Mapungubwe was abandoned.<ref>Ehret, Christopher (2002). p. 252.</ref>\n\nAfter the decline of Mapungubwe, [[Great Zimbabwe]] rose on the Zimbabwe Plateau. ''Zimbabwe'' means stone building. Great Zimbabwe was the first city in Southern Africa and was the center of an empire, consolidating lesser [[Shona people|Shona]] polities. Stone building was inherited from Mapungubwe. These building techniques were enhanced and came into maturity at Great Zimbabwe, represented by the wall of the Great Enclosure. The dry-stack stone masonry technology was also used to build smaller compounds in the area. Great Zimbabwe flourished by trading with Swahili [[Kilwa Empire|Kilwa]] and [[Sofala]]. The rise of Great Zimbabwe parallels the rise of Kilwa. Great Zimbabwe was a major source of gold. Its royal court lived in luxury, wore Indian cotton, surrounded themselves with copper and gold ornaments, and ate on plates from as far away as Persia and China. Around the 1420s and 1430s, Great Zimbabwe was on decline. The city was abandoned by 1450. Some have attributed the decline to the rise of the trading town [[Ingombe Ilede]].<ref>Ehret (2002), pp. 252\u2013254.</ref><ref name=\"Shillington 2005, pp. 147-153\">Shillington (2005), pp. 147\u2013153.</ref>\n\nA new chapter of Shona history ensued. Nyatsimba Mutota, a northern Shona king of the Karanga, engaged in conquest. He and his son Mutope conquered the Zimbabwe Plateau, going through [[Mozambique]] to the east coast, linking the empire to the coastal trade. They called their empire ''Wilayatu 'l Mu'anamutapah'' or ''mwanamutapa'' (Lord of the Plundered Lands), or the [[Kingdom of Mutapa]]. ''Monomotapa'' was the Portuguese corruption. They did not build stone structures; the northern Shonas had no traditions of building in stone. After the death of Matope in 1480, the empire split into two small empires: [[Torwa dynasty|Torwa]] in the south and Mutapa in the north. The split occurred over rivalry from two Shona lords, Changa and Togwa, with the ''mwanamutapa'' line. Changa was able to acquire the south, forming the [[Kingdom of Butua]] with its capital at [[Khami]].<ref name=\"Shillington 2005, pp. 147-153\"/><ref name=\"Davidson 1991, pp. 252-254\">Davidson (1991), pp. 252\u2013254.</ref>\n\nThe [[Kingdom of Mutapa|Mutapa Empire]] continued in the north under the ''mwenemutapa'' line. During the 16th century the Portuguese were able to establish permanent markets up the Zambezi River in an attempt to gain political and military control of Mutapa. They were partially successful. In 1628, a decisive battle allowed them to put a puppet ''mwanamutapa'' named Mavura, who signed treaties that gave favorable mineral export rights to the Portuguese. The Portuguese were successful in destroying the ''mwanamutapa'' system of government and undermining trade. By 1667, Mutapa was in decay. Chiefs would not allow digging for gold because of fear of Portuguese theft, and the population declined.<ref>Davidson (1991), pp. 252\u2013154.</ref>\n\nThe [[Kingdom of Butua]] was ruled by a ''changamire'', a title derived from the founder, Changa. Later it became the [[Rozwi Empire]]. The Portuguese tried to gain a foothold but were thrown out of the region in 1693, by Changamire Dombo. The 17th century was a period of peace and prosperity. The Rozwi Empire fell into ruins in the 1830s from invading [[Nguni people|Nguni]] from [[KwaZulu-Natal|Natal]].<ref name=\"Davidson 1991, pp. 252-254\"/>\n\n====Namibia====\n[[File:Realnam.JPG|thumb|250px|Herero and Nama territories]]\nBy 1500 AD, most of southern Africa had established states. In northwestern [[Namibia]], the [[Ovambo people|Ovambo]] engaged in farming and the [[Herero people|Herero]] engaged in herding. As cattle numbers increased, the Herero moved southward to central Namibia for grazing land. A related group, the [[Mbanderu people|Ovambanderu]], expanded to [[Ghanzi]] in northwestern [[Botswana]]. The [[Nama people|Nama]], a [[Khoisan languages|Khoi-speaking]], sheep-raising group, moved northward and came into contact with the Herero; this would set the stage for much conflict between the two groups. The expanding [[Lozi people|Lozi]] states pushed the [[Mbukushu]], [[Kuhane language|Subiya]], and Yei to Botei, [[Kavango Region|Okavango]], and [[Chobe District|Chobe]] in northern Botswana.<ref>Shillington (2005), p. 218.</ref>\n\n====South Africa and Botswana====\n\n=====Sotho\u2013Tswana=====\n[[File:Realzulu.JPG|thumb|250px|South African ethnic groups]]\nThe development of [[Sotho\u2013Tswana peoples|Sotho\u2013Tswana]] states based on the [[highveld]], south of the [[Limpopo River]], began around 1000 CE. The chief's power rested on cattle and his connection to the ancestor. This can be seen in the [[Toutswemogala Hill]] settlements with stone foundations and stone walls, north of the highveld and south of the [[Vaal River]]. Northwest of the Vaal River developed early [[Tswana people|Tswana]] states centered on towns of thousands of people. When disagreements or rivalry arose, different groups moved to form their own states.<ref name=\"Shillington 2005, pp. 153-155\">Shillington (2005), pp. 153\u2013155.</ref>\n\n=====Nguni peoples=====\nSoutheast of the [[Drakensberg]] mountains lived [[Nguni languages|Nguni-speaking]] peoples ([[Zulu people|Zulu]], [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]], [[Swazi people|Swazi]], and [[South Ndebele people|Ndebele]]). They too engaged in state building, with new states developing from rivalry, disagreements, and population pressure causing movement into new regions. This 19th-century process of warfare, state building and migration later became known as the Mfecane (Nguni) or Difaqane (Sotho). Its major catalyst was the consolidation of the [[Zulu Kingdom]].<ref>Worden, Nigel. The Making of Modern South Africa, Oxford UK/Cambridge USA: Blackwell Publishers, 1995, p. 13.</ref> They were metalworkers, cultivators of millet, and cattle herders.<ref name=\"Shillington 2005, pp. 153-155\"/>\n\n=====Khoisan and Afrikaaner=====\n[[File:SouthAfrica1885.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Political map of Southern Africa in 1885]]\nThe [[Khoisan]] lived in the southwestern [[Cape Province]], where winter rainfall is plentiful. Earlier Khoisan populations were absorbed by [[Bantu peoples]], such as the [[Sotho people|Sotho]] and [[Nguni people|Nguni]], but the [[Bantu expansion]] stopped at the region with winter rainfall. Some [[Bantu languages]] have incorporated the [[click consonant]] of the [[Khoisan languages]]. The Khoisan traded with their Bantu neighbors, providing cattle, sheep, and hunted items. In return, their Bantu speaking neighbors traded copper, iron, and tobacco.<ref name=\"Shillington 2005, pp. 153-155\"/>\n\nBy the 16th century, the [[Dutch East India Company]] established a replenishing station at [[Table Bay]] for restocking water and purchasing meat from the [[Khoikhoi]]. The Khoikhoi received copper, iron, tobacco, and beads in exchange. In order to control the price of meat and stock and make service more consistent, the Dutch established a permanent settlement at Table Bay in 1652. They grew fresh fruit and vegetables and established a hospital for sick sailors. To increase produce, the Dutch decided to increase the number of farms at Table Bay by encouraging freeburgher ''[[boer]]s'' (farmers) on lands worked initially by slaves from West Africa. The land was taken from Khoikhoi grazing land, triggering the first [[Khoikhoi-Dutch Wars|Khoikhoi-Dutch war]] in 1659. No victors emerged, but the Dutch assumed a \"[[right of conquest]]\" by which they claimed all of the cape. In a series of wars pitting the Khoikhoi against each other, the Boers assumed all Khoikhoi land and claimed all their cattle. The second Khoikoi-Dutch war (1673\u20131677) was a cattle raid. The Khoikhoi also died in thousands from European diseases.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 210\u2013213.</ref>\n\nBy the 18th century, the cape colony had grown, with slaves coming from [[Madagascar]], [[Mozambique]], and [[Indonesia]]. The settlement also started to expand northward, but Khoikhoi resistance, raids, and [[guerrilla warfare]] slowed the expansion during the 18th century. Boers who started to practice pastoralism were known as ''[[trekboer]]s''. A common source of ''trekboer'' labor was orphan children who were captured during raids and whose parents had been killed.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 213, 214.</ref>\n\n===Southeast Africa===\n\n====Prehistory====\nAccording to the theory of [[recent African origin of modern humans]], the mainstream position held within the scientific community, all humans originate from either [[East Africa|Southeast Africa]] or the [[Horn of Africa]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Liu|first1=Hua|last2=Prugnolle|first2=Franck|last3=Manica|first3=Andrea|last4=Balloux|first4=Fran\u00e7ois|title=A Geographically Explicit Genetic Model of Worldwide Human-Settlement History|journal=The American Journal of Human Genetics|date=August 2006|volume=79|issue=2|pages=230\u2013237|doi=10.1086/505436|pmid=16826514|pmc=1559480}}</ref> During the first millennium CE, [[Nilotic]] and [[Bantu languages|Bantu]]-speaking peoples [[Bantu expansion|moved into the region]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n====Swahili coast====\n[[File:Swahili door Zanzibar.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A traditional Zanzibari-style [[Swahili people|Swahili]] coast door in [[Zanzibar]].]]\nFollowing the Bantu Migration, on the coastal section of Southeast Africa, a mixed Bantu community developed through contact with [[Muslim]] [[Arab]] and [[Persian people|Persian]] traders, leading to the development of the mixed Arab, Persian and African [[Swahili Coast|Swahili City States]].<ref>{{cite book|author=James De Vere Allen|title=Swahili origins: Swahili culture & the Shungwaya phenomenon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_D5yAAAAMAAJ|year=1993|publisher=J.

The culture's earliest dated artifacts are located in the [[Kagera Region]] of [[Tanzania]], and it extended as far west as the [[Kivu]] region of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], as far east as the [[Nyanza Province|Nyanza]] and [[Western Province (Kenya)|Western]] provinces of [[Kenya]], and north into [[Uganda]], [[Rwanda]] and [[Burundi]].

Research into early Iron Age civilizations in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] has been undertaken concurrently with studies on African linguistics on Bantu expansion. The Urewe culture may correspond to the Eastern subfamily of Bantu languages, spoken by the descendants of the first wave of Bantu peoples to settle East Africa. At first sight, Urewe seems to be a fully developed civilization recognizable through its distinctive, stylish earthenware and highly technical and sophisticated iron working techniques. Given our current level of knowledge, neither seems to have developed or altered for nearly 2,000 years. However, minor local variations in the ceramic ware can be observed.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nUrewe is the name of the site in Kenya brought to prominence through the publication in 1948 of [[Mary Leakey]]'s archaeological findings.

The Austronesians introduced [[banana]] and [[rice]] cultivation, and the Bantu speakers introduced cattle and other farming practices. About the year 1000, Arab and Indian trade settlement were started in northern Madagascar to exploit the Indian Ocean trade.<ref>Shillington (2005), p. 135.</ref> By the 14th century, [[Islam]] was introduced on the island by traders. Madagascar functioned in the East African medieval period as a contact port for the other Swahili seaport city-states such as [[Sofala]], [[Kilwa Sultanate|Kilwa]], [[Mombasa]], and [[Zanzibar]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nSeveral kingdoms emerged after the 15th century: the [[Sakalava people|Sakalava Kingdom]] (16th century) on the west coast, [[Tsitambala]] Kingdom (17th century) on the east coast, and [[Merina]] (15th century) in the central highlands. By the 19th century, Merina controlled the whole island.

[[Radama I of Madagascar|Radama I]] (1810\u20131828) invited Christian [[Missionary|missionaries]] in the early 19th century. Queen [[Ranavalona I]] \"the Cruel\" (1828\u201361) banned the practice of [[Christianity]] in the kingdom, and an estimated 150,000 Christians perished. Under [[Radama II of Madagascar|Radama II]] (1861\u20131863), Madagascar took a French orientation, with great commercial concession given to the French. In 1895, in the second [[Franco-Hova War]], the French invaded Madagascar, taking over [[Antsiranana]] (Diego Suarez) and declaring Madagascar a [[protectorate]].<ref name=\"Lye, Keith2002. pp. 242,243\"/>\n\n====Lake Plateau states and empires====\nBetween the 14th and 15th centuries, large Southeast African kingdoms and states emerged, such as the [[Buganda]]<ref name=\"Roland Oliver 1800. pp. 24-25\">Roland Oliver, et al. \"Africa South of the Equator\", in Africa Since 1800.

Cattle herding, cereal growing, and banana cultivation were the economic mainstays of these states. The [[Ntusi]] and [[Bigo]] earthworks are representative of one of the first states, the [[Bunyoro kingdom]], which oral tradition stipulates was part of the [[Empire of Kitara]] that dominated the whole Lakes region. A [[Luo peoples|Luo]] ethnic elite, from the Bito clan, ruled over the [[Bantu languages|Bantu-speaking]] [[Nyoro people]]. The society was essentially Nyoro in its culture, based on the evidence from pottery, settlement patterns, and economic specialization.<ref name=\"Burns 2007 pp. 122-123\">Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 122\u2013123.</ref>\n\nThe Bito clan claimed legitimacy by being descended from the Bachwezi clan, who were said to have ruled the Empire of Kitara.

Kato Kintu may have migrated to the northwest of [[Lake Victoria]] as early as 1000 BC. Buganda was ruled by the ''[[Kabaka of Buganda|kabaka]]'' with a ''bataka'' composed of the clan heads. Over time, the ''kabakas'' diluted the authority of the ''bataka'', with Buganda becoming a centralized monarchy. By the 16th century, Buganda was engaged in expansion but had a serious rival in [[Bunyoro]]. By the 1870s, Buganda was a wealthy nation-state. The ''kabaka'' ruled with his ''Lukiko'' (council of ministers). Buganda had a naval fleet of a hundred vessels, each manned by thirty men. Buganda supplanted Bunyoro as the most important state in the region. However, by the early 20th century, Buganda became a province of the British [[Uganda Protectorate]].<ref>Lye, Keith (2002). p. 121,122.</ref>\n\n=====Rwanda=====\nSoutheast of Bunyoro, near [[Lake Kivu]] at the bottom of the western rift, the [[Kingdom of Rwanda]] was founded, perhaps during the 17th century. [[Tutsi]] (BaTutsi) pastoralists formed the elite, with a king called the ''[[mwami]]''. The [[Hutu]] (BaHutu) were farmers. Both groups spoke the same language, but there were strict social norms against marrying each other and interaction. According to oral tradition, the Kingdom of Rwanda was founded by Mwami Ruganzu II (Ruganzu Ndori) (c. 1600\u20131624), with his capital near [[Kigali]]. It took 200 years to attain a truly centralized kingdom under Mwami [[Kigeli IV of Rwanda|Kigeli IV]] (Kigeri Rwabugiri) (1840\u20131895). Subjugation of the Hutu proved more difficult than subduing the Tutsi. The last Tutsi chief gave up to Mwami [[Mutara II of Rwanda|Mutara II]] (Mutara Rwogera) (1802\u20131853) in 1852, but the last Hutu holdout was conquered in the 1920s by Mwami [[Yuhi V of Rwanda|Yuhi V]] (Yuli Musinga) (1896\u20131931).<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 123\u2013124.</ref>\n\n=====Burundi=====\n{{Further information|List of Kings of Burundi}}\nSouth of the Kingdom of Rwanda was the [[Burundian monarchy|Kingdom of Burundi]]. It was founded by the Tutsi chief [[Ntare I Kivimira Savuyimba Semunganzashamba Rushatsi Cambarantama|Ntare Rushatsi]] (c. 1657\u20131705). Like Rwanda, Burundi was built on cattle raised by Tutsi pastoralists, crops from Hutu farmers, conquest, and political innovations. Under Mwami [[Ntare IV Rutaganzwa Rugamba|Ntari Rugaamba]] (c. 1795\u20131852), Burundi pursued an aggressive expansionist policy, one based more on diplomacy than force.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 124.</ref>\n\n====Maravi (Malawi)====\n[[File:Maravi Kingdom map c. 1650s.svg|thumb|right|120px|Maravi Kingdom]]\nThe [[Maravi]] claimed descent from Karonga (''kalonga''), who took that title as king. The Maravi connected Central Africa to the east coastal trade, with [[Swahili people|Swahili]] [[Kilwa Empire|Kilwa]]. By the 17th century, the Maravi Empire encompassed all the area between [[Lake Malawi]] and the mouth of the [[Zambezi River]]. The ''karonga'' was Mzura, who did much to extend the empire. Mzura made a pact with the Portuguese to establish a 4,000-man army to attack the [[Shona people|Shona]] in return for aid in defeating his rival Lundi, a chief of the Zimba. In 1623, he turned on the Portuguese and assisted the Shona. In 1640, he welcomed back the Portuguese for trade. The Maravi Empire did not long survive the death of Mzura. By the 18th century, it had broken into its previous polities.<ref>Davidson (1991), pp. 164\u2013165.</ref>\n\n===West Africa===\n\n====Sahelian empires & states====\n\n=====Ghana=====\n{{see also|Serer history}}\n[[File:Ghana empire map.png|thumb|right|250px|Ghana at its greatest extent]]\nThe [[Ghana Empire]] may have been an established kingdom as early as the 8th century AD, founded among the [[Soninke people|Soninke]] by Dinge Cisse. Ghana was first mentioned by Arab geographer [[Al-Farazi]] in the late 8th century. Ghana was inhabited by urban dwellers and rural farmers. The urban dwellers were the administrators of the empire, who were Muslims, and the ''Ghana'' (king), who practiced traditional religion. Two towns existed, one where the Muslim administrators and Berber-Arabs lived, which was connected by a stone-paved road to the king's residence. The rural dwellers lived in villages, which joined together into broader polities that pledged loyalty to the ''Ghana.'' The ''Ghana'' was viewed as divine, and his physical well-being reflected on the whole society. Ghana converted to [[Islam]] around 1050, after conquering [[Aoudaghost]].<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 80\u201385.</ref>\n\nThe Ghana Empire grew wealthy by taxing the [[trans-Saharan trade]] that linked [[Tiaret]] and [[Sijilmasa]] to Aoudaghost. Ghana controlled access to the goldfields of [[Bambouk]], southeast of [[Koumbi Saleh]]. A percentage of salt and gold going through its territory was taken. The empire was not involved in production.<ref>Iliffe, John(2007). p. 51\u201353.</ref>\n\nBy the 11th century, Ghana was in decline. It was once thought that the sacking of Koumbi Saleh by Berbers under the [[Almoravid dynasty]] in 1076 was the cause. This is no longer accepted. Several alternative explanations are cited. One important reason is the transfer of the gold trade east to the [[Niger River]] and the [[Taghaza]] Trail, and Ghana's consequent economic decline. Another reason cited is political instability through rivalry among the different hereditary polities.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 83.</ref>\nThe empire came to an end in 1230, when [[Takrur]] in northern [[Senegal]] took over the capital.<ref>Davidson (1991), pp. 173, 174.</ref><ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/africa/features/storyofafrica/4chapter1.shtml The Story of Africa| BBC World Service<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n=====Mali=====\n{{Further information|Keita Dynasty}}\n[[File:MALI empire map.PNG|thumb|250px|Mali Empire at its greatest extent]]\nThe [[Mali Empire]] began in the 13th century AD, when a [[Mand\u00e9 peoples|Mande]] (Mandingo) leader, [[Sundiata Keita|Sundiata]] (Lord Lion) of the Keita clan, defeated [[Soumaoro Kant\u00e9]], king of the [[Susu people|Sosso]] or southern [[Soninke people|Soninke]], at the [[Battle of Kirina]] in c. 1235. Sundiata continued his conquest from the fertile forests and Niger Valley, east to the Niger Bend, north into the Sahara, and west to the Atlantic Ocean, absorbing the remains of the Ghana Empire. Sundiata took on the title of ''[[Mansa (title)|mansa]]''. He established the capital of his empire at [[Niani, Mali|Niani]].<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 83\u201384.</ref>\n\nAlthough the salt and gold trade continued to be important to the Mali Empire, agriculture and pastoralism was also critical. The growing of [[sorghum]], [[millet]], and rice was a vital function. On the northern borders of the [[Sahel]], grazing cattle, sheep, goats, and camels were major activities. Mande society was organize around the village and land. A cluster of villages was called a ''kafu'', ruled by a ''farma''. The ''farma'' paid tribute to the ''mansa''. A dedicated army of elite cavalry and infantry maintained order, commanded by the royal court. A formidable force could be raised from tributary regions, if necessary.<ref name=\"Burns 2007 pp. 83-87\">Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 83\u201387.</ref>\n\nConversion to [[Islam]] was a gradual process. The power of the ''mansa'' depended on upholding traditional beliefs and a spiritual foundation of power. Sundiata initially kept Islam at bay. Later ''mansas'' were devout Muslims but still acknowledged traditional [[Deity|deities]] and took part in traditional rituals and festivals, which were important to the Mande. Islam became a court religion under Sundiata's son [[Uli I of Mali|Uli I]] (1225\u20131270). ''Mansa'' Uli made a pilgrimage to [[Mecca]], becoming recognized within the Muslim world. The court was staffed with literate Muslims as secretaries and accountants. Muslim traveller [[Ibn Battuta]] left vivid descriptions of the empire.<ref name=\"Burns 2007 pp. 83-87\"/>\n\nMali reached the peak of its power and extent in the 14th century, when [[Musa I of Mali|''Mansa'' Musa]] (1312\u20131337) made his famous ''[[hajj]]'' to Mecca with 500 slaves, each holding a bar of gold worth 500 mitqals.<ref>Davidson, Basil (1971), ''Great Ages of Man: African Kingdoms'', p. 83. New York City: [[Time Life|Time Life Books]]. [[Library of Congress]] 66-25647.</ref> ''Mansa'' Musa's ''hajj'' devalued gold in [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Egypt]] for a decade. He made a great impression on the minds of the Muslim and European world. He invited scholars and architects like [[Al Sahili|Ishal al-Tuedjin]] (al-Sahili) to further integrate Mali into the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]].<ref name=\"Burns 2007 pp. 83-87\"/>\n\nThe Mali Empire saw an expansion of learning and [[literacy]]. In 1285, [[Sakura (mansa)|Sakura]], a [[Freedman|freed slave]], usurped the throne. This ''mansa'' drove the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] out of [[Timbuktu]] and established it as a center of learning and commerce. The book trade increased, and book copying became a very respectable and profitable profession. Timbuktu and [[Djenn\u00e9]] became important centers of learning within the Islamic world.<ref>Davidson (1971), pp. 84\u201385.</ref>\n\nAfter the reign of [[Suleyman (mansa)|Mansa Suleyman]] (1341\u20131360), Mali began its spiral downward. [[Mossi people|Mossi]] cavalry raided the exposed southern border. Tuareg harassed the northern border in order to retake Timbuktu. [[Fula people|Fulani]] (Fulbe) eroded Mali's authority in the west by establishing the independent [[Imamate of Futa Toro]], a successor to the kingdom of [[Takrur]]. [[Serer people|Serer]] and [[Wolof Empire|Wolof]] alliances were broken. In 1545 to 1546, the [[Songhai Empire]] took [[Niani, Mali Empire|Niani]]. After 1599, the empire lost the [[Bambouk]] goldfields and disintegrated into petty polities.<ref name=\"Burns 2007 pp. 83-87\"/>\n\n=====Songhai=====\n{{Further information|Askiya Dynasty|Sonni Dynasty}}\n[[File:SONGHAI empire map.PNG|thumb|right|250px|The Songhai Empire, c. 1500]]\nThe [[Songhai people]] are descended from fishermen on the [[Niger River|Middle Niger River]]. They established their capital at Kukiya in the 9th century AD and at [[Gao]] in the 12th century. The Songhai speak a [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan language]].<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 87.</ref>\n\n[[Sonni Ali]], a Songhai, began his conquest by capturing [[Timbuktu]] in 1468 from the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]]. He extended the empire to the north, deep into the desert, pushed the [[Mossi people|Mossi]] further south of the Niger, and expanded southwest to Djenne. His army consisted of cavalry and a fleet of canoes. Sonni Ali was not a Muslim, and he was portrayed negatively by Berber-Arab scholars, especially for attacking Muslim Timbuktu. After his death in 1492, his heirs were deposed by General [[Askia Mohammad I|Muhammad Ture]], a Muslim of Soninke origins<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 100\u2013101.</ref>\n\nMuhammad Ture (1493\u20131528) founded the [[Askiya Dynasty]], ''[[askiya]]'' being the title of the king. He consolidated the conquests of Sonni Ali. Islam was used to extend his authority by declaring [[jihad]] on the Mossi, reviving the trans-Saharan trade, and having the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid \"shadow\" caliph]] in Cairo declare him as caliph of Sudan. He established Timbuktu as a great center of Islamic learning. Muhammad Ture expanded the empire by pushing the Tuareg north, capturing A\u00efr in the east, and capturing salt-producing [[Taghaza]]. He brought the [[Hausa Kingdoms|Hausa states]] into the Songhay trading network. He further centralized the administration of the empire by selecting administrators from loyal servants and families and assigning them to conquered territories. They were responsible for raising local militias. Centralization made Songhay very stable, even during dynastic disputes. [[Leo Africanus]] left vivid descriptions of the empire under Askiya Muhammad. Askiya Muhammad was deposed by his son in 1528. After much rivalry, Muhammad Ture's last son [[Askia Daoud|Askiya Daoud]] (1529\u20131582) assumed the throne.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 88.</ref>\n\nIn 1591, [[Morocco]] invaded the Songhai Empire under [[Ahmad al-Mansur]] of the [[Saadi Dynasty]] in order to secure the goldfields of the Sahel. At the [[Battle of Tondibi]], the Songhai army was defeated. The Moroccans captured Djenne, Gao, and Timbuktu, but they were unable to secure the whole region. Askiya Nuhu and the Songhay army regrouped at [[Dendi Kingdom|Dendi]] in the heart of Songhai territory where a spirited guerrilla resistance sapped the resources of the Moroccans, who were dependent upon constant resupply from Morocco. Songhai split into several states during the 17th century.\n\nMorocco found its venture unprofitable. The gold trade had been diverted to Europeans on the coast. Most of the trans-Saharan trade was now diverted east to [[Bornu Empire|Bornu]]. Expensive equipment purchased with gold had to be sent across the Sahara, an unsustainable scenario. The Moroccans who remained married into the population and were referred to as ''[[Arma people|Arma]]'' or ''Ruma''. They established themselves at Timbuktu as a military caste with various fiefs, independent from Morocco. Amid the chaos, other groups began to assert themselves, including the [[Fula people|Fulani]] of [[Futa Tooro]] who encroached from the west. The [[Bambara Empire]], one of the states that broke from Songhai, sacked Gao. In 1737, the Tuareg massacred the ''Arma''.<ref name=\"Burns 2007 pp. 88-89\">Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 88\u201389.</ref><ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 100\u2013102, 179\u2013181.</ref>\n\n=====Sokoto Caliphate=====\nThe [[Fula people|Fulani]] were migratory people. They moved from [[Mauritania]] and settled in [[Futa Tooro]], [[Fouta Djallon|Futa Djallon]], and subsequently throughout the rest of West Africa. By the 14th century CE, they had converted to [[Islam]]. During the 16th century, they established themselves at [[Macina, Mali|Macina]] in southern [[Mali]]. During the 1670s, they declared [[jihad]]s on non-Muslims. Several states were formed from these jihadist wars, at Futa Toro, Futa Djallon, Macina, [[Oualia]], and Bundu. The most important of these states was the [[Sokoto Caliphate]] or [[Fulani Empire]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nIn the city of [[Gobir]], [[Usman dan Fodio]] (1754\u20131817) accused the Hausa leadership of practicing an impure version of Islam and of being morally corrupt. In 1804, he launched the [[Fulani War]] as a jihad among a population that was restless about high taxes and discontented with its leaders. Jihad fever swept northern [[Nigeria]], with strong support among both the Fulani and the Hausa. Usman created an empire that included parts of northern Nigeria, [[Benin]], and [[Cameroon]], with [[Sokoto]] as its capital. He retired to teach and write and handed the empire to his son [[Muhammed Bello]].

During the 13th century, when the gold mines in modern-day [[Mali]] started to dry up, Bonoman and later other Akan states began to rise to prominence as the major players in the Gold trade. It was [[Bonoman]] and other Akan kingdoms like [[Denkyira]], [[Akyem]], [[Akwamu]] which were the predecessors to what became the all-powerful [[Empire of Ashanti]]. When and how the Ashante got to their present location is debatable. What is known is that by the 17th century an Akan people were identified as living in a state called Kwaaman. The location of the state was north of Lake Bosomtwe. The state's revenue was mainly derived from trading in gold and [[kola nut]]s and clearing forest to plant [[yam (vegetable)|yams]]. They built towns between the [[Pra River (Ghana)|Pra]] and [[Ofin]] rivers. They formed alliances for defense and paid tribute to [[Denkyira]] one of the more powerful Akan states at that time along with Adansi and [[Akwamu]]. During the 16th century, Ashante society experienced sudden changes, including population growth because of cultivation of [[New World]] plants such as [[cassava]] and [[maize]] and an increase in the gold trade between the coast and the north.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 139.</ref>\n\nBy the 17th century, [[Osei Kofi Tutu I]] (c. 1695\u20131717), with help of [[Okomfo Anokye]], unified what became the Ashante into a confederation with the [[Asante royal thrones|Golden Stool]] as a symbol of their unity and spirit. Osei Tutu engaged in a massive territorial expansion. He built up the Ashante army based on the [[Akan people|Akan]] state of [[Akwamu]], introducing new organization and turning a disciplined militia into an effective fighting machine. In 1701, the Ashante conquered Denkyira, giving them access to the coastal trade with Europeans, especially the Dutch. [[Opoku Ware I]] (1720\u20131745) engaged in further expansion, adding other southern Akan states to the growing empire. He turned north adding [[Techiman]], Banda, [[Gyaaman]], and [[Gonja people|Gonja]], states on the [[Black Volta]]. Between 1744 and 1745, ''Asantehene'' Opoku attacked the powerful northern state of Dagomba, gaining control of the important middle Niger trade routes. [[Kusi Obodom]] (1750\u20131764) succeeded Opoku. He solidified all the newly won territories. [[Osei Kwadwo]] (1777\u20131803) imposed administrative reforms that allowed the empire to be governed effectively and to continue its military expansion. [[Osei Kwame Panyin]] (1777\u20131803), Osei Tutu Kwame (1804\u20131807), and Osei Bonsu (1807\u20131824) continued territorial consolidation and expansion. The Ashante Empire included all of present-day [[Ghana]] and large parts of the [[Ivory Coast]].<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 140.</ref>\n\nThe ''ashantehene'' inherited his position from his mother. He was assisted at the capital, Kumasi, by a civil service of men talented in trade, diplomacy, and the military, with a head called the ''Gyaasehene''. Men from Arabia, Sudan, and Europe were employed in the civil service, all of them appointed by the ''ashantehene''. At the capital and in other towns, the ''ankobia'' or special police were used as bodyguards to the ''ashantehene'', as sources of intelligence, and to suppress rebellion. Communication throughout the empire was maintained via a network of well-kept roads from the coast to the middle Niger and linking together other trade cities.<ref>Davidson (1991), p. 240.</ref><ref>Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 140\u2013141.</ref>\n\nFor most of the 19th century, the Ashante Empire remained powerful. It was later destroyed in 1900 by British superior weaponry and organization following the four [[Anglo-Ashanti wars]].<ref>Davidson (1991), p. 242.</ref>\n\n=====Dahomey=====\n{{Further information|History of the Kingdom of Dahomey}}\n[[File:Dahomey amazon2.jpg|frame|left|250px|Dahomey Amazons, an all-women fighting unit]]\nThe [[Dahomey|Dahomey Kingdom]] was founded in the early 17th century when the [[Aja people]] of the [[Allada]] kingdom moved northward and settled among the [[Fon people|Fon]]. They began to assert their power a few years later. In so doing they established the Kingdom of Dahomey, with its capital at [[Agbome]]. King [[Houegbadja]] (c. 1645\u20131685) organized Dahomey into a powerful centralized state. He declared all lands to be owned of the king and subject to taxation. [[Primogeniture]] in the kingship was established, neutralizing all input from village chiefs. A \"cult of kingship\" was established. A captive slave would be sacrificed annually to honor the royal ancestors. During the 1720s, the slave-trading states of [[Kingdom of Whydah|Whydah]] and [[Allada]] were taken, giving Dahomey direct access to the slave coast and trade with Europeans. King [[Agadja]] (1708\u20131740) attempted to end the slave trade by keeping the slaves on plantations producing palm oil, but the European profits on slaves and Dahomey's dependency on [[firearm]]s were too great. In 1730, under king Agaja, Dahomey was conquered by the [[Oyo Empire]], and Dahomey had to pay tribute. Taxes on slaves were mostly paid in cowrie shells. During the 19th century, palm oil was the main trading commodity.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 191, 192.</ref> [[French colonial empire|France]] conquered Dahomey during the [[Second Franco-Dahomean War]] (1892\u20131894) and established a colonial government there. Most of the troops who fought against Dahomey were native Africans. {{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n=====Yoruba=====\n{{Further information|List of rulers of the Yoruba state of Oyo}}\n[[File:WestAfrica1625.png|thumb|right|250px|Oyo Empire and surrounding states, c. 1625]]\nTraditionally, the [[Yoruba people]] viewed themselves as the inhabitants of a united empire, in contrast to the situation today, in which \"Yoruba\" is the cultural-linguistic designation for speakers of a language in the [[Niger\u2013Congo]] family. The name comes from a [[Hausa language|Hausa]] word to refer to the [[Oyo Empire]]. The first Yoruba state was [[Ife|Ile-Ife]], said to have been founded around 1000 AD by a supernatural figure, the first ''oni'' [[Oduduwa]]. Oduduwa's sons would be the founders of the different city-states of the Yoruba, and his daughters would become the mothers of the various Yoruba ''obas'', or kings. Yoruba city-states were usually governed by an ''oba'' and an ''iwarefa'', a council of chiefs who advised the ''oba.'' by the 18th century, the Yoruba city-states formed a loose confederation, with the ''Oni'' of Ife as the head and Ife as the capital. As time went on, the individual city-states became more powerful with their ''obas'' assuming more powerful spiritual positions and diluting the authority of the ''Oni'' of Ife. Rivalry became intense among the city-states.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 131\u2013132.</ref>\n\nThe Oyo Empire rose in the 16th century. The Oyo state had been conquered in 1550 by the kingdom of [[Nupe people|Nupe]], which was in possession of cavalry, an important tactical advantage. The ''alafin'' (king) of Oyo was sent into exile. After returning, ''Alafin'' [[Orompoto]] (c. 1560\u20131580) built up an army based on heavily armed cavalry and long-service troops. This made them invincible in combat on the northern grasslands and in the thinly wooded forests. By the end of the 16th century, Oyo had added the western region of the Niger to the hills of Togo, the Yoruba of [[Ketu (Benin)|Ketu]], Dahomey, and the Fon nation.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nA governing council served the empire, with clear executive divisions. Each acquired region was assigned a local administrator. Families served in king-making capacities. Oyo, as a northern Yoruba kingdom, served as middle-man in the north-south trade and connecting the eastern forest of [[Guinea]] with the western and central [[Sahel|Sudan]], the Sahara, and North Africa. The Yoruba manufactured cloth, ironware, and pottery, which were exchanged for salt, leather, and most importantly horses from the Sudan to maintain the cavalry. Oyo remained strong for two hundred years.<ref>Davidson (1991), pp. 173\u2013174.</ref><ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 134.</ref> It became a protectorate of [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]] in 1888, before further fragmenting into warring factions.

It was engaged in political expansion and consolidation from its very beginning. Under ''Oba'' (king) [[Ewuare]] (c. 1450\u20131480 AD), the state was organized for conquest. He solidified central authority and initiated 30 years of war with his neighbors. At his death, the Benin Empire extended to [[Dahomey]] in the west, to the [[Niger Delta]] in the east, along the west African coast, and to the Yoruba towns in the north.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nEwuare's grandson ''Oba'' [[Esigie]] (1504\u20131550) eroded the power of the ''uzama'' (state council) and increased contact and trade with Europeans, especially with the Portuguese who provided a new source of copper for court art.\nThe ''oba'' ruled with the advice of the ''uzama'', a council consisting of chiefs of powerful families and town chiefs of different guilds. Later its authority was diminished by the establishment of administrative dignitaries. Women wielded power. The [[Queen mothers (Africa)|queen mother]] who produced the future ''oba'' wielded immense influence.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 134\u2013135.</ref>\n\nBenin was never a significant exporter of slaves, as Alan Ryder's book Benin and the Europeans showed. By the early 18th century, it was wrecked with dynastic disputes and civil wars. However, it regained much of its former power in the reigns of Oba Eresoyen and Oba Akengbuda. After the 16th century, Benin mainly exported pepper, ivory, gum, and cotton cloth to the Portuguese and Dutch who resold it to other African societies on the coast. In 1897, the British sacked the city.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 188\u2013189.</ref>\n\n=====Niger Delta and Igbo=====\n{{Further information|List of rulers of Nri}}\n{{Igbo land labelled map}}\nThe [[Niger Delta]] comprised numerous [[city-state]]s with numerous forms of government. These city-states were protected by the waterways and thick vegetation of the delta. The region was transformed by trade in the 17th century. The delta's city-states were comparable to those of the [[Swahili people]] in East Africa. Some, like [[Kingdom of Bonny|Bonny]], [[Kalabari Kingdom|Kalabari]], and [[Kingdom of Warri|Warri]], had kings. Others, like [[Brass, Nigeria|Brass]], were republics with small senates, and those at [[Cross River State|Cross River]] and [[Calabar|Old Calabar]] were ruled by merchants of the ''ekpe'' society. The ''ekpe'' society regulated trade and made rules for members known as house systems. Some of these houses, like the Pepples of Bonny, were well known in the Americas and Europe.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 136\u2013137.</ref>\n\nThe [[Igbo people|Igbo]] lived east of the delta (but with the [[Anioma]] on the west of the Niger River). The [[Kingdom of Nri]] rose in the 9th century, with the ''Eze'' Nri being its leader. It was a political entity composed of villages, and each village was autonomous and independent with its own territory and name, each recognized by its neighbors. Villages were democratic with all males and sometimes females a part of the decision-making process. Graves at [[Igbo-Ukwu]] (800 AD) contained brass artifacts of local manufacture and glass beads from Egypt or India, indicative of extraregional trade.<ref>Martin, Phyllis M. and O'Meara, Patrick(1995). p. 95.</ref><ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 137.</ref>\n\n==19th century==\n\n===Southern Africa===\nBy the 1850s, British and German missionaries and traders had penetrated present-day [[Namibia]]. [[Herero people|Herero]] and [[Nama people|Nama]] competed for guns and ammunition, providing cattle, ivory, and ostrich feathers. The Germans were more firmly established than the British in the region. By 1884, the [[German colonial empire|Germans]] declared the coastal region from the [[Orange River]] to the [[Cunene River|Kunene River]] a German protectorate, part of [[German South West Africa]]. They pursued an aggressive policy of land expansion for white settlements. They exploited rivalry between the Nama and Herero.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 218, 327\u2013329, 340\u2013342.</ref>\n\nThe Herero entered into an alliance with the Germans, thinking they could get an upper hand on the Nama. The Germans set up a garrison at the Herero capital and started allocating Herero land for white settlements, including the best grazing land in the central plateau, and made tax and labor demands. The Herero and [[Mbanderu people|Ovambanderu]] rebelled, but the rebellion was crushed and leaders were executed. Between 1896 and 1897, [[rinderpest]] crippled the economic backbone of the Herero and Nama economy and slowed white expansion. The Germans continued the policy of making Namibia a white settlement by seizing land and cattle, and even trying to export Herero labor to South Africa.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 218, 327</ref>\n\nIn 1904, the Herero rebelled. German General [[Lothar von Trotha]] implemented an [[Herero and Namaqua genocide|extermination policy]] at the [[Battle of Waterberg]], which drove the Herero west of the [[Kalahari Desert]]. At the end of 1905, only 16,000 Herero were alive, out of a previous population of 80,000. Nama resistance was crushed in 1907. All Nama and Herero cattle and land were confiscated from the very diminished population, with remaining Nama and Herero assuming a subordinate position. Labor had to be imported from among the Ovambo.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 218, 327.</ref>\n\n===Nguniland===\nA moment of great disorder in southern Africa was the ''[[Mfecane]]'', \"the crushing.\" It was started by the northern Nguni kingdoms of [[Mthethwa Paramountcy|Mthethwa]], [[Ndwandwe]], and [[Swaziland]] over scarce resource and famine. When [[Dingiswayo]] of Mthethwa died, [[Shaka]] of the Zulu people took over. He established the [[Zulu Kingdom]], asserting authority over the Ndwandwe and pushing the Swazi north. The scattering Ndwandwe and Swazi caused the Mfecane to spread. During the 1820s, Shaka expanded the empire all along the Drakensberg foothills, with tribute being paid as far south as the [[Tugela River|Tugela]] and [[Umzimkulu River|Umzimkulu]] rivers. He replaced the chiefs of conquered polities with ''indunas'', responsible to him. He introduced a centralized, dedicated, and disciplined military force not seen in the region, with a new weapon in the short stabbing-spear.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 256, 257, 270.</ref>\n\nIn 1828, Shaka was assassinated by his half brother [[Dingane kaSenzangakhona|Dingane]], who lacked the military genius and leadership skills of Shaka. [[Voortrekkers]] tried to occupy Zulu land in 1838. In the early months they were defeated, but the survivors regrouped at the [[Blood River|Ncome River]] and soundly defeated the Zulu. However, the Voortrekkers dared not settle Zulu land. Dingane was killed in 1840 during a civil war. His brother [[Mpande]] took over and strengthened Zulu territories to the north. In 1879 [[Anglo-Zulu War|the Zulu Kingdom was invaded]] by Britain in a quest to control all of [[South Africa]]. The Zulu Kingdom was victorious at the [[Battle of Isandlwana]] but was defeated at the [[Battle of Ulundi]].<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 256, 257.</ref><ref name=\"Davidson 1991, pp. 274\u2013275\">Davidson (1991), pp. 274\u2013275.</ref>\n\nOne of the major states to emerge from the [[Mfecane]] was the [[Lesotho|Sotho Kingdom]] founded at [[Thaba Bosiu]] by [[Moshoeshoe I]] around 1821 to 1822. It was a [[confederation]] of different polities that accepted the absolute authority of Moshoeshoe. During the 1830s, the kingdom invited missionaries as a strategic means of acquiring guns and horses from the [[Cape Province|Cape]]. The [[Orange Free State]] slowly diminished the kingdom but never completely defeated it. In 1868, Moshoeshoe asked that the Sotho Kingdom be annexed by Britain, to save the remnant. It became the British protectorate of [[Basutoland]].<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 261\u2013262, 271.</ref>\n\n===Voortrekkers===\nBy the 19th century, most Khoikhoi territory was under [[Boer]] control. The Khoikhoi had lost economic and political independence and had been absorbed into Boer society. The Boers spoke [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]], a language or dialect derived from Dutch, and no longer called themselves Boers but [[Afrikaners]]. Some Khoikhoi were used as [[commando]]s in raids against other Khoikhoi and later Xhosa. A mixed Khoi, slave, and European population called the [[Cape Coloureds]], who were outcasts within colonial society, also arose. Khoikhoi who lived far on the frontier included the Kora, [[Oorlams creole|Oorlams]], and [[Griqua people|Griqua]]. In 1795, the British took over the cape colony from the Dutch.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 215\u2013216.</ref>\n\nIn the 1830s, Boers embarked on a journey of expansion, east of the [[Great Fish River]] into the Zuurveld. They were referred to as ''[[Voortrekkers]]''. They founded republics of the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]] and [[Orange Free State]], mostly in areas of sparse population that had been diminished by the ''[[Mfecane|Mfecane/Difaqane]]''. Unlike the Khoisan, the Bantu states were not conquered by the Afrikaners, because of population density and greater unity. Additionally, they began to arm themselves with guns acquired through trade at the cape. In some cases, as in the [[Xhosa Wars|Xhosa/Boer Wars]], Boers were removed from [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] lands. It required a dedicated imperial military force to subdue the Bantu-speaking states. In 1901, the Boer republics were defeated by Britain in the [[Second Boer War]]. The defeat however consummated many Afrikaners' ambition: South Africa would be under white rule. The British placed all power\u2014legislative, executive, administrative\u2014in English and Afrikaner hands.<ref name=\"Davidson 1991, pp. 274\u2013275\"/><ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 268\u2013271.</ref>\n\n===European trade, exploration and conquest===\n{{Further information|European exploration of Africa|African slave trade|Scramble for Africa}}\n[[File:Maxim machine gun Megapixie.jpg|thumb|right|250px|1895 .303 tripod mounted Maxim machine gun]]\nBetween 1878 and 1898, European states partitioned and conquered most of Africa. For 400 years, European nations had mainly limited their involvement to trading stations on the African coast. Few dared venture inland from the coast; those that did, like the Portuguese, often met defeats and had to retreat to the coast. Several technological innovations helped to overcome this 400-year pattern. One was the development of [[repeating rifle]]s, which were easier and quicker to load than [[musket]]s. [[Artillery]] was being used increasingly. In 1885, [[Hiram S. Maxim]] developed the [[maxim gun]], the model of the modern-day [[machine gun]]. European states kept these weapons largely among themselves by refusing to sell these weapons to African leaders.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 268\u2013269.</ref>\n\nAfrican germs took numerous European lives and deterred permanent settlements. Diseases such as [[yellow fever]], [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]], [[yaws]], and [[leprosy]] made Africa a very inhospitable place for Europeans. The deadliest disease was [[malaria]], endemic throughout [[Tropical Africa]]. In 1854, the discovery of [[quinine]] and other medical innovations helped to make conquest and colonization in Africa possible.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 269.</ref>\n\nStrong motives for conquest of Africa were at play. Raw materials were needed for European factories. Europe in the early part of the 19th century was undergoing its [[Industrial Revolution]]. Nationalist rivalries and prestige were at play. Acquiring African colonies would show rivals that a nation was powerful and significant. These factors culminated in the [[Scramble for Africa]].<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 265.</ref>\n\n[[File:Davidlivingstone cropped.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[David Livingstone]], early European explorer of the interior of Africa]]\nKnowledge of Africa increased. Numerous European explorers began to explore the continent. [[Mungo Park (explorer)|Mungo Park]] traversed the [[Niger River]]. [[James Bruce]] travelled through [[Ethiopia]] and located the source of the [[Blue Nile]]. [[Richard Francis Burton]] was the first European at [[Lake Tanganyika]]. [[Samuel White Baker]] explored the Upper Nile. [[John Hanning Speke]] located a source of the [[Nile]] at [[Lake Victoria]]. Other significant European explorers included [[Heinrich Barth]], [[Henry Morton Stanley]] (coiner of the term \"[[wikt:Dark Continent|Dark Continent]]\" for Africa in an 1878 book), [[Ant\u00f3nio Silva Porto|Silva Porto]], [[Alexandre de Serpa Pinto]], [[Rene Caille]], [[Friedrich Gerhard Rohlfs]], [[Gustav Nachtigal]], [[George Schweinfurth]], and [[Joseph Thomson (explorer)|Joseph Thomson]]. The most famous of the explorers was [[David Livingstone]], who explored southern Africa and traversed the continent from the Atlantic at [[Luanda]] to the Indian Ocean at [[Quelimane]]. European explorers made use of African guides and servants, and established long-distance trading routes were used.<ref>Shillington (2005), p. 295.</ref><ref name=\"Burns 2007 pp. 254-257\">Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 254\u2013257.</ref>\n\nMissionaries attempting to spread [[Christianity]] also increased European knowledge of Africa.<ref name=\"Burns 2007 pp. 254-257\"/> Between 1884 and 1885, European nations met at the [[Berlin Conference (1884)|Berlin West Africa Conference]] to discuss the partitioning of Africa. It was agreed that European claims to parts of Africa would only be recognised if Europeans provided effective occupation. In a series of treaties in 1890\u20131891, colonial boundaries were completely drawn. All of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] was claimed by European powers, except for Ethiopia (Abyssinia) and [[Liberia]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nThe European powers set up a variety of different administrations in Africa, reflecting different ambitions and degrees of power. In some areas, such as parts of [[British West Africa]], colonial control was tenuous and intended for simple economic extraction, strategic power, or as part of a long term development plan. In other areas, Europeans were encouraged to settle, creating settler states in which a European minority dominated. Settlers only came to a few colonies in sufficient numbers to have a strong impact. British settler colonies included [[British East Africa]] (now Kenya), [[Northern Rhodesia|Northern]] and [[Southern Rhodesia]], ([[Zambia]] and [[Zimbabwe]], respectively), and [[South Africa]], which already had a significant population of European settlers, the [[Boer]]s. France planned to settle [[French Algeria|Algeria]] and eventually incorporate it into the French state on an equal basis with the European provinces. Algeria's proximity across the Mediterranean allowed plans of this scale.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nIn most areas colonial administrations did not have the manpower or resources to fully administer the territory and had to rely on local power structures to help them. Various factions and groups within the societies exploited this European requirement for their own purposes, attempting to gain positions of power within their own communities by cooperating with Europeans. One aspect of this struggle included what [[Terence Ranger]] has termed the \"invention of tradition.\" In order to legitimize their own claims to power in the eyes of both the colonial administrators and their own people, native elites would essentially manufacture \"traditional\" claims to power, or ceremonies. As a result, many societies were thrown into disarray by the new order.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nFollowing the [[Scramble for Africa]], an early but secondary focus for most [[colony|colonial]] [[regime]]s was the suppression of slavery and the slave trade. By the end of the colonial period they were mostly successful in this aim, though slavery is still very active in Africa.<ref>Lovejoy, Paul E. 2012</ref>\n\n===France versus Britain: the Fashoda crisis of 1898===\n[[File:Fashoda Incident map - en.svg|thumb|left|upright 1.6|Central and east Africa, 1898, during the [[Fashoda Incident]].]]\n{{further information|French colonial empire}}\nAs a part of the [[Scramble for Africa]], France had the establishment of a continuous west-east axis of the continent as an objective, in contrast with [[Cape to Cairo Red Line|the British north-south axis]].

They ruled until after World War II when forces of nationalism grew much stronger. In the 1950s and 1960s the colonial holdings became independent states. The process was usually peaceful but there were several long bitter bloody civil wars, as in Algeria,<ref>Alistair Horne, ''A savage war of peace: Algeria 1954\u20131962'' (1977).</ref> Kenya<ref>David Anderson, ''Histories of the hanged: The dirty war in Kenya and the end of empire'' (2005).</ref> and elsewhere. Across Africa the powerful new force of [[nationalism]] drew upon the organizational skills that natives learned in the British and French and other armies in the world wars. It led to organizations that were not controlled by or endorsed by either the colonial powers not the traditional local power structures that were collaborating with the colonial powers. Nationalistic organizations began to challenge both the traditional and the new colonial structures and finally displaced them. Leaders of nationalist movements took control when the European authorities exited; many ruled for decades or until they died off. These structures included political, educational, religious, and other social organizations. In recent decades, many African countries have undergone the triumph and defeat of nationalistic fervor, changing in the process the loci of the centralizing state power and patrimonial state.<ref>Gabriel Almond and James S. Coleman, ''The Politics of the Developing Areas'' (1971)</ref><ref>Festus Ugboaja Ohaegbulam, ''Nationalism in colonial and post-colonial Africa'' (University Press of America, 1977).</ref><ref>Thomas Hodgkin, ''Nationalism in Colonial Africa'' (1956)</ref>\n\n===World War I===\nWith the vast majority of the continent under the colonial control of European governments, the World Wars were significant events in the geopolitical history of Africa.  Africa was a theater of war and saw fighting in both wars.  More important in most regions, the [[total war]] footing of colonial powers impacted the governance of African colonies, through resource allocation, conscription, and taxation.  In [[World War I]] there were several campaigns in Africa, including the [[Togoland Campaign]], the [[Kamerun Campaign]], the [[South West Africa campaign]], and the [[East African Campaign (World War I)|East African campaign]].  In each, Allied forces, primarily British, but also French, Belgian, South African, and Portuguese, sought to force the Germans out of their African colonies.  In each, German forces were badly outnumbered and, due to Allied naval superiority, were cut off from reinforcement or resupply.  The Allies eventually conquered all German colonies; German forces in East Africa managed to avoid surrender thorughout the war, though they could not hold any territory after 1917. After World War I, [[List of former German colonies|former German colonies]] in Africa were taken over by France, Belgium, and the British Empire.\n\nAfter World War I, colonial powers continued to consolidate their control over their African territories.  In some areas, particularly in Southern and East Africa, large settler populations were successful in pressing for additional devolution of administration, so-called \"home rule\" by the white settlers.  In many cases, settler regimes were harsher on African populations, tending to see them more as a threat to political power, as opposed to colonial regimes which had generally endeavored to coopt local populations into economic production.  The [[Great Depression]] strongly affected Africa's non-subsistence economy, much of which was based on commodity production for Western markets.  As demand increased in the late 1930s, Africa's economy rebounded as well.\n\nAfrica was the site of one of the first instances of [[fascist]] territorial expansions in the 1930s.  Italy had attempted to conquer Ethiopia in the 1890s but had been rebuffed in the [[First Italo-Ethiopian War]].  Ethiopia lay between two Italian colonies, [[Italian Somaliland]] and [[Eritrea]] and was invaded in October 1935.  With an overwhelming advantage in [[armor]] and aircraft, by May 1936, Italian forces had occupied the capital of [[Addis Ababa]] and effectively declared victory. Ethiopia and their other colonies were consolidated into [[Italian East Africa]].\n===World War II: Political===\n[[File:Map of Africa in 1939.png|thumb|right|Areas controlled by European powers in 1939. British (red) and Belgian (Orange) colonies fought with the Allies. Italian (green) with the Axis. French colonies (dark blue) fought alongside the Allies until the Fall of France in June 1940. Vichy was in control until the Free French prevailed in late 1942. Portuguese (brown) and Spanish (teal) colonies remained neutral.]]\n\nAfrica was a large continent whose geography gave it strategic importance during the war. North Africa was the scene of major British and American campaigns against Italy and Germany; East Africa was the scene of a major British campaign against Italy.  The vast  geography provided major transportation routes linking the United States to the Middle East and Mediterranean regions. The sea route around South Africa was heavily used even though it added 40 days to voyages that had to avoid the dangerous Suez region. Lend Lease supplies to Russia often came this way. Internally, long-distance road and railroad connections facilitated the British war effort. The Union of Africa had dominion status and was largely self-governing, the other British possessions were ruled by the colonial office, usually with close ties to local chiefs and kings. Italian holdings were the target of successful British military campaigns. The Belgian Congo, and two other Belgian colonies, were major exporters. In terms of numbers and wealth, the British -controlled the richest portions of Africa, and made extensive use not only of the geography, but the manpower, and the natural resources.  Civilian colonial officials made a special effort to upgrade the African infrastructure, promote agriculture, integrate colonial Africa with the world economy, and recruit over a half million soldiers. <ref>  Ashley Jackson, ''The British Empire and the Second World War '' (2006) 171-239. </ref><ref>David Killingray and Richard Rathbone, edfs. ''Africa and the Second World War'' (1986).</ref>\n\nBefore the war, Britain had made few plans for the utilization of Africa, but it quickly set up command structures. The Army set up the West Africa Command, which recruited 200,000 soldiers. The East Africa Command was created in September 1941 to support the overstretched Middle East Command.  It provided the largest number of men, over 320,000, chiefly from Kenya, Tanganyika, and Uganda. The Southern Command was the domain of South Africa. The Royal Navy set up the South Atlantic Command based in Sierra Leone, that became one of the main convoy assembly points. The RAF Coastal Command had major submarine-hunting operations based in West Africa, while a smaller RAF command Dealt with submarines in the Indian Ocean. Ferrying aircraft from North America and Britain was the major mission of the Western Desert Air Force. In addition smaller more localized commands were set up throughout the war.<ref>  Jackson, ''The British Empire and the Second World War '' (2006) 175-77. </ref>\n\nBefore 1939, the military establishments were very small throughout British Africa, and largely consisted of whites, who comprised under two percent of the population outside South Africa.   As soon as the war began, newly created African units were set up, primarily by the Army.  The new recruits were almost always volunteers, usually provided in close cooperation with local tribal leaders. During the war, military pay scales far exceeded what civilians natives could earn, especially when food, housing and clothing allowances are included. The largest numbers were in construction units, called Pioneer units, with over 82,000 soldiers.. The RAF and Navy also did some recruiting. The volunteers did some fighting, a great deal of guard duty, and construction work. 80,000 served in the Middle East. A special effort was made not to challenge white supremacy, certainly before the war, and to a large extent during the war itself. Nevertheless, the soldiers were drilled and train to European standards, given strong doses of propaganda, and learn leadership and organizational skills that proved essential to the formation of nationalistic and independence movements after 1945. There were minor episodes of discontent, but nothing serious, among the natives.<ref>Jackson, ''The British Empire and the Second World War '' (2006) pp 180-189.</ref> Afrikaner nationalism was a factor in South Africa, But the proto-German Afrikaner prime minister was replaced in 1939 by [[Jan Smuts]], an Afrikaner who was an enthusiastic supporter of the British Empire. His government closely cooperated with London and raised 340,000 volunteers (190,000 were white, or about one-third of the eligible white men).<ref>Jackson, ''The British Empire and the Second World War '' (2006) pp 240-45.</ref>\n====French Africa====\nAs early as 1857, the French established volunteer units of black soldiers in sub- Sahara Africa, termed the ''tirailleurs senegalais.'' They served in military operations throughout the Empire, including 171,000 soldiers in World War I and 160,000 in World War II. <ref>Robert Aldrich, ''Greater France: A History of French Overseas Expansion'' (1996) p 223.</ref>  About 90,000 became POWs in Germany.

Gabon fell to Free France after the [[Battle of Gabon]] in November 1940, but West Africa remained under Vichy control until November 1942.  Vichy forces tried to resist the overwhelming  [[Allied landings in North Africa]] (operation ''Torch'') in November 1942. Vichy Admiral [[Fran\u00e7ois Darlan]] suddenly switched sides and the fighting ended.<ref>Arthur L. Funk, \"Negotiating the 'Deal with Darlan'.\" ''Journal of Contemporary History'' 8.2 (1973): 81-117.</ref> The Allies gave Darlan control of North African French forces in exchange for support from both [[French North Africa]] as well as [[French West Africa]].

De Gaulle finally won out.<ref>Arthur Layton Funk, ''Charles de Gaulle: the crucial years, 1943-1944'' (1959).</ref>\n\n===World War II: Military===\n\nSince Germany had lost its African colonies following World War I, World War II did not reach Africa until [[Pact of Steel|Italy joined the war]] on June 10, 1940, controlling Libya and Italian East Africa.  With the [[fall of France]] on June 25, most of France's colonies in North and West Africa were controlled by the [[Vichy government]], though much of Central Africa fell under [[Free French]] control after some fighting between Vichy and Free French forces at the [[Battle of Dakar]] and the [[Battle of Gabon]].   After the fall of France, Africa was the only active theater for ground combat until the [[Italian invasion of Greece]] in October.  In the [[Western Desert campaign]] Italian forces from Libya sought to overrun Egypt, controlled by the British.  Simultaneously, in the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African campaign]], Italian East African forces overran [[British Somaliland]] and some British outposts in [[Kenya]] and [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]].  When Italy's efforts to conquer Egypt (including the crucial [[Suez Canal]]) and Sudan fell short, they were unable to reestablish supply to Italian East Africa. Without the ability to reinforce or resupply and surrounded by Allied possessions, Italian East Africa was conquered by mainly British and South African forces in 1941. In North Africa, the Italians soon requested help from the Germans who sent a substantial force under General [[Rommel]].  With German help, the Axis forces regained the upper hand but were unable to break through British defenses in two tries at [[El Alamein]].  In late 1942, Allied forces, mainly Americans and Canadians, invaded French North Africa in [[Operation Torch]], where Vichy French forces initially surprised them with their resistance but were convinced to stop fighting after three days.  The second front relieved pressure on  the British in Egypt who began pushing west to meet up with the Torch forces, eventually pinning German and Italian forces in [[Tunisia]], which was conquered by May 1943 in the [[Tunisia campaign]], ending the war in Africa. The only other significant operations occurred in the French colony of Madagascar, which was invaded by the British in May 1942 to deny its ports to the Axis (potentially the [[Imperial Japan|Japanese]] who had reached the eastern Indian Ocean).  The French garrisons in Madagascar surrendered in November 1942.\n\n===Post-war Africa: decolonization===\n{{further information|Historical African place names}}\n[[File:Africa independence dates.svg|thumb|right|250px|Dates of independence of African countries]]\n\nThe [[decolonization of Africa]] started with [[Libya]] in 1951, although [[Liberia]], [[South Africa]], [[Egypt]] and [[Ethiopia]] were already independent. Many countries followed in the 1950s and 1960s, with a peak in 1960 with the [[Year of Africa]], which saw 17 African nations declare independence, including a large part of [[French West Africa]]. Most of the remaining countries gained independence throughout the 1960s, although some colonizers (Portugal in particular) were reluctant to relinquish sovereignty, resulting in bitter wars of independence which lasted for a decade or more. The last African countries to gain formal independence were [[Guinea-Bissau]] (1974), [[Mozambique]] (1975) and [[Angola]] (1975) from Portugal; [[Djibouti]] from France in 1977; [[Zimbabwe]] from the United Kingdom in 1980; and [[Namibia]] from South Africa in 1990.

Professional scholarship appeared around 1900, and began with the study of business operations, typically using government documents and unpublished archives.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nThe economic approach was widely practiced in the 1930s, primarily to provide descriptions of the changes underway in the previous half-century.

Melo Coutinho), the [[Tanimbar Islands]], some of the [[Caroline Islands]] (by [[Gomes de Sequeira]] in 1525), and west [[Papua New Guinea]] (by [[Jorge de Menezes]] in 1526). In 1519 a [[Crown of Castile|Castilian]] ([[Spanish Empire|'Spanish']]) expedition led by [[Ferdinand Magellan]] sailed down the east coast of South America, found and sailed through the [[Strait of Magellan|strait that bears his name]] and on 28 November 1520 entered the ocean which he named \"Pacific\". The three remaining ships, led by Magellan and his captains [[Duarte Barbosa]] and [[Jo\u00e3o Serr\u00e3o]], then sailed north and caught the [[trade winds]] which carried them across the Pacific to the Philippines where Magellan was killed. One surviving ship led by [[Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Elcano]] returned west across the Indian Ocean and [[Trinidad (ship)|the other]] went north in the hope of finding the [[westerlies]] and reaching Mexico. Unable to find the right winds, it was forced to return to the East Indies.

From then until 1815 the annual [[Manila Galleons]] crossed the Pacific from Mexico to the Philippines and back, in the first transpacific trade route in history. Combined with the Spanish Atlantic or [[West Indies Fleet]], the Manila Galleons formed one of the first global maritime exchange in human history, linking Seville in Spain with Manila in the Philippines, via Mexico.\n\nLater, in the quest for [[Terra Australis]], Spanish explorers in the 17th century discovered the [[Pitcairn Islands|Pitcairn]] and [[Vanuatu]] archipelagos, and sailed the [[Torres Strait]] between [[Australia]] and New Guinea, named after navigator [[Lu\u00eds Vaz de Torres]]. In 1668 the Spanish founded a colony on [[Guam]] as a resting place for west-bound galleons.

Cook mapped the complete New Zealand coastline, making only some minor errors (such as calling [[Banks Peninsula]] an island, and thinking [[Stewart Island/Rakiura]] was a peninsula of the [[South Island]]). He also identified [[Cook Strait]], which separates the [[North Island]] from the South Island, and which Tasman had not seen.\n\nCook then voyaged west, reaching the south-eastern coast of Australia on 19 April 1770, and in doing so his expedition became the first recorded Europeans to have encountered its eastern coastline.<ref group=\"note\">At this time, the [[International Date Line]] had yet to be established, so the dates in Cook's journal are a day earlier than those accepted today.</ref> On 23 April he made his first recorded direct observation of [[indigenous Australians]] at [[Brush Island]] near [[Bawley Point, New South Wales|Bawley Point]], noting in his journal: \"''\u2026and were so near the Shore as to distinguish several people upon the Sea beach they appear'd to be of a very dark or black Colour but whether this was the real colour of their skins or the C[l]othes<!--not a mistake, don't change it--> they might have on I know not''.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://southseas.nla.gov.au/journals/cook/17700422.html|title=Cook's Journal: Daily Entries, 22 April 1770|accessdate=21 September 2011}}</ref> On 29 April Cook and crew made their first landfall on the mainland of the continent at a place now known as the [[Cronulla sand dunes, Kurnell Peninsula|Kurnell Peninsula]].

On his first voyage, Cook had demonstrated by circumnavigating New Zealand that it was not attached to a larger landmass to the south. Although he charted almost the entire eastern coastline of Australia, showing it to be continental in size, the Terra Australis was believed by the Royal Society to lie further south.<ref>{{harvnb|Hough|1994|p=182}}</ref>\n\nCook commanded {{HMS|Resolution|1771|6}} on this voyage, while [[Tobias Furneaux]] commanded its companion ship, {{HMS|Adventure|1771|6}}. Cook's expedition circumnavigated the globe at an extreme southern [[latitude]], becoming one of the first to cross the [[Antarctic Circle]] (17 January 1773). In the Antarctic fog, ''Resolution'' and ''Adventure'' became separated. Furneaux made his way to New Zealand, where he lost some of his men during an encounter with [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]], and eventually sailed back to Britain, while Cook continued to explore the Antarctic, reaching 71\u00b010'S on 31 January 1774.<ref name=\"G_Williams\" />\n\n[[File:James Cook, English navigator, witnessing human sacrifice in Taihiti (Otaheite) c. 1773.jpg|thumb|upright=1.36|right|James Cook witnessing human sacrifice in [[Tahiti]] c. 1773]]\n\nCook almost encountered the mainland of [[Antarctica]], but turned towards Tahiti to resupply his ship. He then resumed his southward course in a second fruitless attempt to find the supposed continent. On this leg of the voyage he brought a young Tahitian named [[Omai]], who proved to be somewhat less knowledgeable about the Pacific than [[Tupaia (navigator)|Tupaia]] had been on the first voyage. On his return voyage to New Zealand in 1774, Cook landed at the [[Tonga|Friendly Islands]], [[Easter Island]], [[Norfolk Island]], [[New Caledonia]], and [[Vanuatu]].\n\nBefore returning to England, Cook made a final sweep across the South Atlantic from [[Cape Horn]].

Cook explored and mapped the coast all the way to the [[Bering Strait]], on the way identifying what came to be known as [[Cook Inlet]] in Alaska. In a single visit, Cook charted the majority of the North American north-west coastline on world maps for the first time, determined the extent of Alaska, and closed the gaps in Russian (from the West) and Spanish (from the South) exploratory probes of the Northern limits of the Pacific.<ref name=G_Williams>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/captaincook_01.shtml|title=Captain Cook: Explorer, Navigator and Pioneer|first=Glyn|last=Williams|date=17 February 2011 |accessdate=5 September 2011 |publisher=BBC}}</ref>\n\nCook returned to Hawaii in 1779. After sailing around the archipelago for some eight weeks, he made landfall at [[Kealakekua Bay]], on [[Hawaii (island)|'Hawaii Island']], largest island in the [[Hawaiian Islands|Hawaiian Archipelago]]. Cook's arrival coincided with the ''[[Makahiki]]'', a Hawaiian [[harvest festival]] of worship for the Polynesian god [[Lono]]. Coincidentally the form of Cook's ship, HMS ''Resolution'', or more particularly the mast formation, sails and rigging, resembled certain significant artefacts that formed part of the season of worship.<ref name=\"collingridge\">{{harvnb|Collingridge|2003|}}</ref><ref name=\"seven\" /> Similarly, Cook's clockwise route around the island of Hawaii before making landfall resembled the processions that took place in a clockwise direction around the island during the Lono festivals. It has been argued (most extensively by [[Marshall Sahlins]]) that such coincidences were the reasons for Cook's (and to a limited extent, his crew's) initial [[apotheosis|deification]] by some Hawaiians who treated Cook as an incarnation of Lono.<ref name=\"Sahlins1985\">{{harvnb|Sahlins|1985}}</ref> Though this view was first suggested by members of Cook's expedition, the idea that any Hawaiians understood Cook to be Lono, and the evidence presented in support of it, were challenged in 1992.<ref name=\"seven\">{{harvnb|Obeyesekere|1992}}</ref><ref name=\"2nd ed\">{{harvnb|Obeyesekere|1997}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Zoffany Death of Captain Cook.jpg|thumb|right|''[[The Death of Captain James Cook (Zoffany)|The Death of Captain James Cook, 14 February 1779]]'', an unfinished painting by [[Johann Zoffany]], {{circa|1795}}<ref name=\"NMM \u2013 The Death of Captain James Cook\">{{cite web|url=http://collections.rmg.co.uk/collections/objects/11916.html|title=The Death of Captain James Cook, 14 February 1779 \u2013 National Maritime Museum|publisher=[[National Maritime Museum]]|accessdate=11 July 2012}}</ref>]]\n\nAfter a month's stay, Cook resumed his exploration of the Northern Pacific. Shortly after leaving Hawaii Island, however, the ''Resolution''{{'s}} foremast broke, so the ships returned to [[Kealakekua Bay]] for repairs. Tensions rose, and a number of quarrels broke out between the Europeans and Hawaiians. On 14 February 1779, at Kealakekua Bay, some Hawaiians took one of Cook's small boats. As thefts were quite common in [[Tahiti]] and the other islands, Cook would have taken hostages until the stolen articles were returned.<ref name=\"collingridge\" /> He attempted to take as hostage the [[Alii Aimoku of Hawaii|King of Hawai\u02bbi]], [[Kalani\u02bb\u014dpu\u02bbu]]. The Hawaiians prevented this, and Cook's men had to retreat to the beach. As Cook turned his back to help launch the boats, he was struck on the head by the villagers and then stabbed to death as he fell on his face in the surf.<ref>{{harvnb|Collingridge|2003|p=410}}</ref> Hawaiian tradition says that he was killed by a chief named [[Kalaimanokahoowaha|Kalaimanokaho\u02bbowaha or Kana\u02bbina]].<ref>{{cite book|authorlink=Sheldon Dibble|last=Dibble|first=Sheldon|title=History of the Sandwich Islands|publisher=Press of the Mission Seminary|year=1843|location=Lahainaluna|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EwqpkYKuXSMC|page=61}}</ref> The Hawaiians dragged his body away.

The body was [[Disembowelment|disembowelled]], baked to facilitate removal of the flesh, and the bones were carefully cleaned for preservation as [[Icon|religious icons]] in a fashion somewhat reminiscent of the treatment of European saints in the [[Middle Ages]].

In 1883, following a short-lived French annexation of [[New Ireland (island)|New Ireland]], the [[British colony]] of [[Queensland]] annexed south-eastern New Guinea. However, the Queensland government's superiors in the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] revoked the claim, and (formally) assumed direct responsibility in 1884, when [[German Empire|Germany]] claimed north-eastern New Guinea as the protectorate of [[German New Guinea]] (also called [[Kaiser-Wilhelmsland]]).\n\nThe first Dutch government posts were established in 1898 and in 1902:  Manokwari on the north coast, Fak-Fak in the west and Merauke in the south at the border with [[Territory of Papua|British New Guinea]].  The German, Dutch and British colonial administrators each attempted to suppress the still-widespread practices of inter-village warfare and [[headhunting]] within their respective territories.<ref>White, Osmar.

During World War I, Australian forces seized German New Guinea, which in 1920 became the [[Territory of New Guinea]],\nto be administered by Australia under a [[League of Nations mandate]].  The territories under Australian administration became collectively known as The Territories of Papua and New Guinea (until February 1942).\n\n=== German colonization ===\n\nGermany established colonies in [[German New Guinea|New Guinea]] in 1884, and [[German Samoa|Samoa]] in 1900.\n\nFollowing [[papal]] mediation and German compensation of $4.5 million, Spain recognized a German claim in 1885. Germany established a [[protectorate]] and set up trading stations on the islands of [[Jaluit]] and [[Ebon Atoll|Ebon]] to carry out the flourishing [[copra]] (dried [[coconut]] meat) trade. Marshallese [[Iroij]] (high chiefs) continued to rule under indirect colonial German administration.\n\n=== American colonization ===\n\nThe United States also expanded into the Pacific, beginning with [[Baker Island]] and [[Howland Island]] in 1857, and with Hawaii becoming a [[Territory of Hawaii|U.S. territory]] in 1898. Disagreements between the US, Germany and UK over Samoa led to the [[Tripartite Convention (1899)|Tripartite Convention of 1899]].\n\nSamoa aligned its interests with the United States in a Deed of Succession, signed by the ''[[Tui Manua Elisala|Tui Man\u00fa\u02bba]]'' (supreme chief of Man\u00fa\u02bba) on 16 July 1904 at the Crown residence of the Tuimanu\u02bba called the ''Faleula'' in the place called Lalopua (from Official documents of the Tuimanu\u02bba government, 1893; Office of the Governor, 2004).\n\nCession followed the [[Tripartite Convention (1899)|Tripartite Convention of 1899]] that partitioned the eastern islands of [[Samoa]] (including Tutuila and the Man\u00fa\u02bba Group) from the western islands of Samoa (including \u02bbUpolu and Savai\u02bbi).\n\n=== Japanese colonization ===\nAt the beginning of World War I, Japan assumed control of the Marshall Islands. The Japanese headquarters was established at the German center of administration, [[Jaluit]]. On 31 January 1944, during World War II, American forces landed on [[Kwajalein]] [[atoll]] and U.S. Marines and Army troops later took control of the islands from the Japanese on 3 February, following intense fighting on Kwajalein and [[Enewetak Atoll|Enewetak]] atolls. In 1947, the United States, as the occupying power, entered into an agreement with the [[UN Security Council]] to administer much of [[Micronesia]], including the Marshall Islands, as the [[Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands]].\n\nDuring World War II, Japan colonized many Oceanic colonies by wresting control from western powers.\n\n== Samoan Crisis 1887\u20131889 ==\n{{See also|Samoan Civil War|Second Samoan Civil War|Siege of Apia|German Samoa}}\n\n[[File:Samoan Crisis wrecks 2.jpg|thumb|right|Wrecked vessels at Apia, 1889]]\n\n[[File:SMS Adler 1889 1.jpg|thumb|left|SMS ''Adler'' wrecked at Apia, 1889]]\n\nThe '''Samoan Crisis''' was a confrontation standoff between the United States, [[Imperial Germany]] and Great Britain from 1887\u20131889 over control of the [[Samoan Islands]] during the [[Samoan Civil War]].

The attack led to the [[Military history of the United States during World War II|United States' entry into World War II]].\n\nThe attack was intended as a [[preventive war|preventive]] action in order to keep the [[U.S. Pacific Fleet]] from interfering with military actions the [[Empire of Japan]] was planning in South-East Asia against overseas territories of the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and the United States. There were simultaneous Japanese attacks on the U.S.-held [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Philippines]] and on the [[British Empire]] in [[British Malaya|Malaya]], [[Singapore]], and Hong Kong.\n\nThe Japanese subsequently invaded New Guinea, the Solomon Islands and other Pacific islands. The Japanese were turned back at the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]] and the [[Kokoda Track campaign]] before they were finally defeated in 1945.\n\nSome of the most prominent Oceanic battlegrounds were the [[Solomon Islands campaign]], the [[Bombing of Darwin|Air raids on Darwin]], the [[Kokoda Track campaign|Kokada Track]], and the [[Borneo campaign]].\n\nIn 1940 the administration of French Polynesia recognised the Free French Forces and many Polynesians served in World War II.

Following a landing near Gona, on the north coast of [[New Guinea]], Japanese forces attempted to advance south overland through the mountains of the [[Owen Stanley Range]] to seize [[Port Moresby]] as part of a strategy of isolating Australia from the United States. Initially only limited Australian forces were available to oppose them, and after making rapid progress the Japanese [[South Seas Force]] clashed with under strength Australian forces at Awala, forcing them back to Kokoda. A number of Japanese attacks were subsequently fought off by the Australian [[Australian Army Reserve|Militia]], yet they began to withdraw over the Owen Stanley Range, down the [[Kokoda Track]].\n\nIn sight of Port Moresby itself, the Japanese began to run out of momentum against the Australians who began to receive further reinforcements. Having outrun their supply lines and following the reverses suffered by the Japanese at [[Guadalcanal Campaign|Guadalcanal]], the Japanese were now on the defensive, marking the limit of the Japanese advance southwards. The Japanese subsequently withdrew to establish a defensive position on the north coast, but they were followed by the Australians who recaptured Kokoda on 2 November. Further fighting continued into November and December as the Australian and [[US Army|United States]] forces assaulted the Japanese beachheads, in what later became known as the [[Battle of Buna\u2013Gona]].{{Clear}}\n\n== Nuclear testing in Oceania ==\n\n[[File:Crossroads baker explosion.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.36|A 21 kiloton underwater [[nuclear weapon]]s test, known as Operation CROSSROADS (Event Baker), conducted at [[Bikini Atoll]] (1946)]]\n\nDue to its low population, Oceania was a popular location for atmospheric and [[Underground nuclear testing|underground nuclear tests]]. Tests were conducted in various locations by the United Kingdom ([[Operation Grapple]] and [[British nuclear tests at Maralinga#Operation Antler|Operation Antler]]), the United States ([[Bikini atomic experiments|Bikini atoll]] and the [[Pacific Proving Grounds|Marshall Islands]]) and France ([[Moruroa]]), often with devastating consequences for the inhabitants.\n\nFrom 1946 to 1958, the Marshall Islands served as the [[Pacific Proving Grounds]] for the United States, and was the site of 67 [[nuclear tests]] on various atolls. The world's first [[hydrogen bomb]], codenamed \"[[Ivy Mike|Mike]]\", was tested at the [[Enewetak]] atoll in the [[Marshall Islands]] on 1 November (local date) in 1952, by the United States.\n\nIn 1954, [[Nuclear fallout|fallout]] from the American [[Castle Bravo]] [[hydrogen bomb]] test in the [[Marshall Islands]] was such that the inhabitants of the [[Rongelap]] Atoll were forced to abandon their island. Three years later the islanders were allowed to return, but suffered abnormally high levels of cancer. They were evacuated again in 1985 and in 1996 given $45 million in compensation.\n\nA series of British tests were also conducted in the 1950s at [[British nuclear tests at Maralinga|Maralinga]] in [[South Australia]], forcing the removal of the [[Pitjantjatjara people|Pitjantjatjara]] and [[Yankunytjatjara]] peoples from their ancestral homelands.\n\nIn 1962, France's early nuclear testing ground of Algeria became independent and the atoll of [[Moruroa]] in the Tuamotu Archipelago was selected as the new testing site. Moruroa atoll became notorious as a site of French nuclear testing, primarily because tests were carried out there after most Pacific testing had ceased. These tests were opposed by most other nations in Oceania.  The last atmospheric test was conducted in 1974, and the last underground test in 1996.\n\nFrench [[nuclear testing]] in the Pacific was controversial in the 1980s, in 1985 French agents caused the [[Sinking of the Rainbow Warrior]] in [[Auckland]] to prevent it from arriving at the test site in [[Moruroa]]. In September 1995, France stirred up widespread protests by resuming nuclear testing at Fangataufa atoll after a three-year moratorium. The last test was on 27 January 1996. On 29 January 1996, France announced that it would accede to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, and no longer test nuclear weapons.\n\n== Fijian coups ==\n{{Main|1987 Fijian coups d'\u00e9tat|2000 Fijian coup d'\u00e9tat|2006 Fijian coup d'\u00e9tat}}\n\n[[File:Fiji-0050.JPG|thumb|right|The burnt out remains of Govinda's Restaurant in Suva: over 100 shops and businesses were ransacked in Suva's central business district on 19 May 2000]]\n\nFiji has suffered several [[coups d'\u00e9tat]]: military in 1987 and 2006 and civilian in 2000.

The 1987 coup followed the election of a multi-ethnic coalition, which [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Sitiveni Rabuka]] overthrew, claiming racial discrimination against ethnic Fijians. The coup was denounced by the [[United Nations]] and Fiji was expelled from the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].\n\nThe 2000 coup was essentially a repeat of the 1987 affair, although it was led by civilian [[George Speight]], apparently with military support. [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] [[Frank Bainimarama]], who was opposed to Speight, then took over and appointed a new Prime Minister. Speight was later tried and convicted for [[treason]]. Many indigenous Fijians were unhappy at the treatment of Speight and his supporters, feeling that the coup had been legitimate. In 2006 the [[Parliament of Fiji|Fijian parliament]] attempted to introduce a series of bills which would have, amongst other things, pardoned those involved in the 2000 coup. Bainimarama, concerned that the legal and racial injustices of the previous coups would be perpetuated, staged his own coup. It was internationally condemned, and Fiji again suspended from the Commonwealth.\n\nIn 2006 the then Australia Defence Minister, [[Brendan Nelson]], warned Fijian officials of an Australian Naval fleet within proximity of Fiji that would respond to any attacks against its citizens.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/hands-off-fiji-army-commander-warns/2006/11/24/1164341398059.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Hands off Fiji, army commander warns | date=25 November 2006}}</ref>\n\n== Bougainville Civil War ==\n{{Main|History of Bougainville}}\n\nThe Australian government estimated that anywhere between 15,000 and 20,000 people could have died in the [[Bougainville Civil War]].

These were resisted by Papua New Guinea primarily because of the presence in Bougainville of the Panguna mine, which was vital to Papua New Guinea's economy.
