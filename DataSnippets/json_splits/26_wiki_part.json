It is among the largest of the African forest [[antelope]] [[species]].\n\nBongos are characterised by a striking reddish-brown coat, black and white markings, white-yellow stripes and long slightly spiralled horns. Indeed, bongos are the only [[Tragelaphus|tragelaphid]] in which both sexes have horns. They have a complex social interaction and are found in African dense forest mosaics.\n\nThe '''western''' or '''lowland bongo''', ''T. e. eurycerus'', faces an ongoing population decline, and the [[IUCN]] Antelope Specialist Group considers it to be [[Near Threatened]] on the [[conservation status]] scale.\n\nThe '''eastern''' or''' mountain bongo''', ''T. e. isaaci'', of [[Kenya]], has a coat even more vibrant than that of ''T. e. eurycerus''. The mountain bongo is only found in the wild in one remote region of central Kenya. This bongo is classified by the IUCN Antelope Specialist Group as [[Critically Endangered]], with more specimens in captivity than in the wild.\n\nIn 2000, the [[Association of Zoos and Aquariums]] in the USA (AZA) upgraded the bongo to a Species Survival Plan participant and in 2006 added the Bongo Restoration to Mount Kenya Project to its list of the Top Ten Wildlife Conservation Success Stories of the year. However, in 2013, it seems, these successes have been negated with reports of possibly only 100 mountain bongos left in the wild due to [[logging]] and [[poaching]].\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe [[scientific name]] of the bongo is ''Tragelaphus eurycerus'', and it belongs to the [[genus]] ''[[Tragelaphus]]'' and [[family (biology)|family]] [[Bovidae]]. It was first described by Irish naturalist [[William Ogilby]] in 1837.<ref name=MSW3>{{MSW3|id=14200729|page=698}}</ref> The [[Generic name (biology)|generic name]] ''Tragelaphus'' is composed of two Greek words: ''tragos'', meaning a male goat; and ''elaphos'', meaning deer.<ref>{{MerriamWebsterDictionary|Tragelaphus|accessdate=7 February 2016}}</ref> The [[Specific name (zoology)|specific name]] ''eurycerus'' originated from the fusion of ''eurus'' (broad, widespread) and ''keras'' (an animal's horn).<ref name=\"huffman\">{{cite web|last1=Huffman|first1=B.|title=Bongo|url=http://www.ultimateungulate.com/artiodactyla/tragelaphus_eurycerus.html|website=Ultimate Ungulate|accessdate=7 February 2016}}</ref> The common name \"bongo\" originated probably from the [[Kele language (Gabon)|Kele]] language of [[Gabon]]. The first known use of the name \"bongo\" dates back to 1861.<ref>{{MerriamWebsterDictionary|Bongo|accessdate=7 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nBongos are further classified into two [[subspecies]]: ''T. e. eurycerus'', the lowland or western bongo, and the far rarer ''T. e. isaaci'', the mountain or eastern bongo, restricted to the mountains of Kenya only. The eastern bongo is larger and heavier than the western bongo. Two other subspecies are described from West and Central Africa, but taxonomic clarification is required. They have been observed to live up to 19 years.<ref name=Spinage>Spinage, C.A. (1986) ''The Natural History of Antelopes''. New York: Facts on File Publications.</ref>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nBongos are found in [[tropical]] [[jungle]]s with dense undergrowth up to an altitude of {{convert|4,000|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} in Central Africa, with isolated populations in [[Kenya]], and these West African countries: [[Cameroon]], the [[Central African Republic]], the [[Republic of the Congo]], the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], the [[Ivory Coast]], [[Equatorial Guinea]],  [[Gabon]], [[Ghana]], [[Guinea]], [[Liberia]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[South Sudan]].\n[[Image:Tragelaphus eurycerus isaaciPCCA20071227-8374B.jpg|left|thumb|A bongo drinks from a [[swamp]].]]\nHistorically, bongos are found in three disjunct parts of Africa: East, Central and West. Today, all three populations\u2019 ranges have shrunk in size due to habitat loss for agriculture and uncontrolled timber cutting, as well as [[hunting]] for [[meat]].\n\nBongos favour disturbed forest mosaics that provide fresh, low-level green vegetation.   Such habitats may be promoted by heavy browsing by [[African elephant|elephants]], fires, flooding, tree-felling (natural or by logging), and [[fallowing]]. Mass [[bamboo]] die-off provides ideal habitat in East Africa. They can live in bamboo forests.\n\n==Appearance==\nBongos are one of the largest of the forest antelopes. In addition to the deep [[chestnut]] colour of their coats, they have bright white stripes on their sides to help with [[camouflage]].\n\nAdults of both sexes are similar in size. Adult height is about {{convert|1.1|to|1.3|m|ft|abbr=on}} at the shoulder and length is {{convert|2.15|to|3.15|m|ft|abbr=on}}, including a tail of {{convert|45|-|65|cm|in|abbr=on}}. Females weigh around {{convert|150|\u2013|235|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, while males weigh about {{convert|220|\u2013|405|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. Its large size puts it as the third-largest in the Bovidae tribe of Strepsicerotini, behind both the [[common eland|common]] and [[giant eland|greater eland]]s by about {{convert|300|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, and above the greater kudu by about {{convert|40|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite journal|title=''Tragelaphus eurycerus''|url=http://www.science.smith.edu/msi/pdf/i0076-3519-111-01-0001.pdf|journal=Mammalian Species|volume=111|pages=1\u20134|year=1978|author=Ralls, Katherine|doi=10.2307/3503808}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| author = Kingdon, Jonathan |url = | title =''Kingdon Guide to African Mammals''| year = 1993| isbn = 978-0-85112-235-9}}</ref>\n\nBoth sexes have heavy spiral horns; those of the male are longer and more massive. All bongos in captivity are from the isolated [[Aberdare Mountains]] of central [[Kenya]].\n\n===Coat and body===\n[[Image:BongoNEW.jpg|thumb|left|The side facial patination of an eastern bongo]] \nThe bongo sports a bright [[auburn hair|auburn]] or [[chestnut (color)|chestnut]] coat, with the neck, chest, and legs generally darker than the rest of the body. Coats of male bongos become darker as they age until they reach a dark [[mahogany]]-brown colour. Coats of female bongos are usually more brightly coloured than those of males. The eastern bongo is darker in color than the western and this is especially pronounced in older males which tend to be chestnut brown, especially on the forepart of their bodies.\n\nThe pigmentation in the coat rubs off quite easily; [[anecdotal]] reports suggest rain running off a bongo may be tinted red with [[pigment]]. The smooth coat is marked with 10\u201315 vertical white-yellow stripes, spread along the back from the base of the neck to the rump. The number of stripes on each side is rarely the same. It also has a short, bristly, brown ridge of dorsal hair from the shoulder to the rump; the white stripes run into this ridge.\n\nA white chevron appears between the eyes, and two large white spots grace each cheek. Another white chevron occurs where the neck meets the chest. The large ears are to sharpen hearing, and the distinctive coloration may help bongos identify one another in their dark forest habitats. Bongos have no special secretion glands, so rely less on scent to find one another than do other similar antelopes. The lips of a bongo are white, topped with a black muzzle.\n\n===Horns===\n[[Image:Bongo Burger Zoo.jpg|thumb|upright|An eastern bongo's horns]]\nBongos have two heavy and slightly spiralled [[horn (anatomy)|horns]] that slope over their backs, and like many other [[antelope]] species, both male and female bongos have horns. Bongos are the only tragelaphids in which both sexes have horns. The horns of bongos are in the form of a [[lyre]] and bear a resemblance to those of the related antelope species of [[nyala]]s, [[sitatunga]]s, [[bushbuck]]s, [[kudu]]s and [[Taurotragus|elands]].\n\nUnlike [[deer]], which have branched [[antler]]s shed annually, bongos and other antelopes have pointed horns they keep throughout their lives. Males have massive backswept horns, while females have smaller, thinner, and more parallel horns. The size of the horns range between {{convert|75|and|99|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}}. The horns twist once.\n\nLike all other horns of antelopes, the core of a bongo's horn is hollow and the outer layer of the horn is made of [[keratin]], the same material that makes up human fingernails, toenails. and hair. The bongo runs gracefully and at full speed through even the thickest tangles of [[liana]]s, laying its heavy spiralled horns on its back so the brush cannot impede its flight. Bongos are hunted for their horns by humans.<ref>Walther, F. R. (1990) \"Spiral-horned antelopes\". In ''Grzimek's Encyclopedia of Mammals''. S. P. Parker (ed.). New York: McGraw-Hill. Volume 5, pp. 344\u2013359.</ref>\n\n==Social organization and behavior==\n[[Image:Mountain bongo mount kenya.jpg|thumb|left|This female eastern bongo presents her hindquarters while looking over her shoulder to check for threats at Mt. Kenya Wildlife Conservancy.]]\nLike other forest [[ungulates]], bongos are seldom seen in large groups. Males, called bulls, tend to be solitary, while females with young live in groups of six to eight. Bongos have seldom been seen in herds of more than 20. [[Gestation]] is about 285&nbsp;days (9.5&nbsp;months), with one young per birth, and [[weaning]] occurs at six months. [[Sexual maturity]] is reached at 24\u201327&nbsp;months. The preferred habitat of this species is so dense and difficult to operate in, that few Europeans or Americans observed this species until the 1960s.<!-- conflict - zoo? Current living animals derive solely from Kenyan importations made during 1969\u20131978.<ref>Kingdon, Jonathan (1982) ''East African Mammals'' Vol. IIIC. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press.</ref>-->\nAs young males mature and leave their maternal groups, they most often remain solitary, although rarely they join an older male. Adult males of similar size/age tend to avoid one another. Occasionally, they meet and spar with their horns in a ritualised manner and it is rare for serious fights to take place. However, such fights are usually discouraged by visual displays, in which the males bulge their necks, roll their eyes, and hold their horns in a vertical position while slowly pacing back and forth in front of the other male. They seek out females only during mating time.<ref>Estes, Richard D. (1991) ''The Behavior Guide to African Mammals: Including Hoofed Mammals, Carnivores, Primates''. Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press.</ref> When they are with a herd of females, males do not coerce them or try to restrict their movements as do some other antelopes.\n\nAlthough mostly [[nocturnal]], they are occasionally active during the day. However, like deer, bongos may exhibit [[crepuscular]] behaviour.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Bongos are both timid and easily frightened; after a scare, a bongo moves away at considerable speed, even through dense undergrowth. Once they find cover, they stay alert and face away from the disturbance, but peek every now and then to check the situation.<ref name=Spinage/> The bongo's hindquarters are less conspicuous than the forequarters, and from this position the animal can quickly flee.\n\nWhen in distress, the bongo emits a [[bleat]]. It uses a limited number of vocalisations, mostly grunts and snorts; females have a weak mooing contact-call for their young. Females prefer to use traditional [[Birth|calving]] grounds restricted to certain areas, while newborn calves lie in hiding for a week or more, receiving short visits by the mother to [[Breastfeeding|suckle]].<ref>Estes, Richard (1993) ''The Safari Companion''. Vermont: Chelsea Green Publishing Co..</ref>\n\nThe calves grow rapidly and can soon accompany their mothers in the nursery herds. Their horns grow rapidly and begin to show in 3.5 months. They are weaned after six months and reach sexual maturity at about 20 months.\n\n==Diet==\n[[Image:BongoP2.jpg|thumb|upright|A male bongo eating grass at [[Louisville Zoo]]]]\nLike many forest [[ungulate]]s, bongos are [[Herbivore|herbivorous]] browsers and feed on [[Leaf|leaves]], [[Shrub|bushes]], [[vine]]s, [[bark (biology)|bark]] and pith of rotting trees, [[grass]]es/herbs, [[root]]s, [[cereal]]s, and [[fruit]]s.\n\nBongos require [[salt]] in their [[diet (nutrition)|diets]], and are known to regularly visit natural salt licks. Examination of bongo feces revealed that charcoal from trees burnt by lightning is consumed. This behavior is believed to be a means of getting salts and [[mineral]]s into their diets. This behavior has also been reported in the [[okapi]]. Another similarity to the okapi, though the bongo is unrelated, is that the bongo has a long [[prehensile]] tongue which it uses to grasp grasses and leaves.\n\nSuitable habitats for bongos must have permanent water available.<ref>Nowak, Ronald (1991) ''M. Walker's Mammals of the World'' 5th ed. Vol. II. Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press</ref> As a large animal, the bongo requires an ample amount of food, and is restricted to areas with abundant year-round growth of herbs and low shrubs.\n\n==Population and conservation==\nFew estimates of population density are available. Assuming average population densities of 0.25 animals per km<sup>2</sup> in regions where it is known to be common or abundant, and 0.02 per km<sup>2</sup> elsewhere, and with a total area of occupancy of 327,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, a total population estimate of around 28,000 is suggested. Only about 60% are in protected areas, suggesting the actual numbers of the lowland subspecies may only be in the low tens of thousands. In Kenya, their numbers have declined significantly and on [[Mt. Kenya]], they were [[Wiktionary:extirpate|extirpated]] within the last decade due to illegal hunting with dogs. Although information on their status in the wild is lacking, lowland bongos are not presently considered endangered.\n\nBongos are susceptible to diseases such as [[rinderpest]], which almost exterminated the species during the 1890s. ''Tragelaphus eurycerus'' may suffer from [[goitre]]. Over the course of the disease, the [[thyroid glands]] greatly enlarge (up to 10 x 20&nbsp;cm) and may become [[:wikt:polycystic|polycystic]]. Pathogenesis of goiter in the bongo may reflect a mixture of genetic predisposition coupled with environmental factors, including a period of exposure to a [[goitrogen]].<ref name='schiller'>{{Cite journal\n | doi = 10.1177/030098589503200305\n| pmid = 7604491\n| title = Clinical and Morphologic Findings of Familial Goiter in Bongo Antelope (Tragelaphus eurycerus)\n| journal = Veterinary Pathology\n| volume = 32\n| issue = 3\n| pages = 242\u20139\n| year = 1995\n| last1 = Schiller | first1 = C.

Humans prey on them for their [[Fur|pelt]]s, horns, and meat, with the species being a common local source for \"bush meat\".<ref name=MSW3/> Bongo populations have been greatly reduced by hunting, [[poaching]], and [[animal trapping]], although some bongo refuges exist.\n\nAlthough bongos are quite easy for humans to catch using snares, many people native to the bongos' habitat believed that if they ate or touched bongo, they would have spasms similar to [[epileptic seizures]]. Because of this [[superstition]], bongos were less harmed in their native ranges than expected. However, these taboos are said no longer to exist, which may account for increased hunting by humans in recent times.\n\n===Zoo programmes===\n[[Image:Eastern Bongo at Edinburgh Zoo.jpg|thumb|upright|Eastern bongo at [[Edinburgh Zoo]]]] \nAn international studbook is maintained to help manage animals held in captivity. Because of its bright colour, it is very popular in zoos and private collections. In North America, over 400 individuals are thought to be held, a population that probably exceeds that of the mountain bongo in the wild.\n\nIn 2000, the [[Association of Zoos and Aquariums]] (AZA) upgraded the bongo to a Species Survival Plan participant, which works to improve the [[genetic diversity]] of managed animal populations. The target population for participating zoos and private collections in North America is 250 animals. Through the efforts of zoos in North America, a reintroduction to the population in Kenya is being developed.\n\nAt least one collaborative effort for reintroduction between North American wildlife facilities has already been carried out. In 2004, 18 eastern bongos born in North American zoos gathered at [[White Oak Conservation]] in [[Yulee, Florida]] for release in Kenya. White Oak staff members traveled with the bongos to a Mt. Kenya holding facility, where they stayed until being reintroduced.<ref>{{cite web|title=Eastern Bongo|url=http://www.whiteoakwildlife.org/animal-programs/eastern-bongo/|accessdate=21 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Conservation===\nIn the last few decades, a rapid decline in the numbers of wild mountain bongo has occurred due to poaching and human pressure on their habitat, with local extinctions reported in [[Cherangani Hills|Cherangani]] and [[Chepalungu]] hills, Kenya.\n\nThe Bongo Surveillance Programme, working alongside the [[Kenya Wildlife Service]], have recorded photos of bongos at remote salt licks in the Aberdare Forests using camera traps, and, by analyzing [[DNA]] extracted from [[Feces|dung]], have confirmed the presence of bongo in Mount Kenya, [[Ol Doinyo Eburru|Eburru]] and [[Mau forest]]s. The programme estimate as few as 140 animals left in the wild \u2013 spread across four isolated populations. Whilst captive breeding programmes can be viewed as having been successful in ensuring survival of this species in Europe and North America, the situation in the wild has been less promising. Evidence exists of bongo surviving in Kenya. However, these populations are believed to be small, fragmented, and vulnerable to extinction.\n\nAnimal populations with impoverished genetic diversity are inherently less able to adapt to changes in their environments (such as climate change, disease outbreaks, habitat change, etc.). The isolation of the four remaining small bongo populations, which themselves would appear to be in decline, means a substantial amount of genetic material is lost each generation. Whilst the population remains small, the impact of transfers will be greater, so the establishment of a \"metapopulation management plan\" occurs concurrently with conservation initiatives to enhance ''in situ'' population growth, and this initiative is both urgent and fundamental to the future survival of mountain bongo in the wild.\n\nThe western/lowland bongo faces an ongoing population decline as habitat destruction and hunting pressures increase with the relentless expansion of human settlement. Its long-term survival will only be assured in areas which receive active protection and management. At present, such areas comprise about 30,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, and several are in countries where political stability is fragile. So, a realistic possibility exists whereby its status could decline to Threatened in the near future.\n\nAs the largest and most spectacular forest antelope, the western/lowland bongo is both an important flagship species for protected areas such as national parks, and a major trophy species which has been taken in increasing numbers in Central Africa by sport hunters during the 1990s.<ref name=j1>{{Cite journal\n | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-3008.1999.00079.x\n| title = The potential role of safari hunting as a source of revenue for protected areas in the Congo Basin\n| journal = Oryx\n| volume = 33\n| issue = 4\n| pages = 340\n| year = 1999\n| last1 = Wilkie | first1 = D.

If this does not occur, it will eventually become extinct in the wild. The existence of a healthy captive population of this subspecies offers the potential for its reintroduction.<ref>IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources). 2002. IUCN Red List of Threatened Species</ref>\n\n===Groups supporting bongo conservation in Kenya===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Four bongo calves with nanny.jpg|thumb|left|Four bongo calves photographed here with a \"nanny\": All will be released into the wild near Mount Kenya.]] -->\nIn 2004, Dr. Jake Veasey, the head of the Department of Animal Management and Conservation at [[Woburn Safari Park]] and a member of the European Association of Zoos and Aquariums Population Management Advisory Group, with the assistance of Lindsay Banks, took over responsibility for the management and coordination of the European Endangered Species Programme for the eastern bongo. This includes some 250 animals across Europe and the Middle East.\n\nAlong with the [[Rothschild giraffe]], the eastern bongo is arguably one of the most threatened large mammals in Africa, with recent estimates numbering less than 140 animals, below a minimum sustainable viable population. The situation is exacerbated because these animals are spread across four isolated populations. Whilst the bongo endangered species program can be viewed as having been successful in ensuring survival of this species in Europe, it has not yet become actively involved in the conservation of this species in the wild in a coordinated fashion. The plan is to engage in conservation activities in Kenya to assist in reversing the decline of the eastern bongo populations and genetic diversity in Africa, and in particular, applying population management expertise to help ensure the persistence of genetic diversity in the free ranging wild populations.\n\n[[Image:Baby Bongo 002.jpg|thumb|upright|A baby eastern bongo at [[Louisville Zoo]] in [[Kentucky]]]]\nTo illustrate significance of genetic diversity loss, assume the average metapopulation size is 35 animals based on 140 animals spread across four populations (140/4=35). Assuming stable populations, these populations will lose 8% of their genetic diversity every decade. By managing all four populations as one, through strategic transfers, gene loss is reduced from 8% to 2% per decade, without any increase in bongo numbers in Kenya. By managing the European and African populations as one \u2013 by strategic exports from Europe combined with ''in situ'' transfers, gene loss is reduced to 0.72% every 100 years, with both populations remaining stable. If populations in Kenya are allowed to grow through the implementation of effective conservation, including strategic transfers, gene loss can be effectively halted in this species and its future secured in the wild.\n\nThe initial aims of the project are: \n# Through faecal [[DNA]] analysis, estimate the genetic diversity of the remaining wild bongos and calculate the relatedness of the isolated wild populations.\n# More accurately estimate the total population of wild bongos through faecal DNA analysis, camera trapping, and transect surveying.\n# Through direct sampling, estimate the genetic diversity of the captive bongo population and calculate its relatedness with the remaining isolated wild populations.\n# Collect DNA samples from western bongos to calculate the relatedness of the two subspecies.\n# Fund rangers to collect the above data in Kenya, enhance the degree of protection afforded to and level of understanding of the eastern bongos' ecological needs.\n# To realise such a metapopulation management plan, work with local communities is essential to reverse the decline and allow for the implementation of a transfer strategy. A substantial proportion of wild genetic diversity likely will have already been lost.\n\nIf effective protection were implemented immediately and bongo populations allowed to expand without transfers, then this would create a bigger population of genetically impoverished bongos. These animals would be less able to adapt to a dynamic environment. Whilst the population remains small, the impact of transfers will be greater. For this reason, the 'metapopulation management plan' must occur concurrently with conservation strategies to enhance ''in situ'' population growth. This initiative is both urgent and fundamental to the future survival of the mountain bongo in the wild.\n\n<!-- uncited, different from Programme?

George French Angus may have collected a description of a bunyip in his account of a \"water spirit\" from the Moorundi people of the [[Murray River]] before 1847, stating it is \"much dreaded by them&nbsp;... It inhabits the Murray; but&nbsp;... they have some difficulty describing it. Its most usual form&nbsp;... is said to be that of an enormous starfish.\"<ref>George French Angus(1847) ''Savage Life and Scenes in Australia and New Zealand''. Vol 1, p.99. London. Reprinted 1969 Libraries Board of South Australia.</ref> Robert Brough Smyth's ''Aborigines of Victoria'' (1878) devoted ten pages to the bunyip, but concluded \"in truth little is known among the blacks respecting its form, covering or habits; they appear to have been in such dread of it as to have been unable to take note of its characteristics.\"<ref>Smyth cited in {{harvnb|Holden|2001|p = 175}}</ref> Common features as reported in many 19th-century newspaper accounts include a dog-like face, a crocodile-like head, dark fur, a [[horse]]-like tail, [[flipper (anatomy)|flipper]]s, and [[walrus]]-like [[tusk]]s or horns, or a [[duck]]-like bill.<ref>For numerous examples see Peter Ravenscroft's survey of nineteenth-century newspaper accounts of the bunyip at ''Bunyip and Inland Seal Archive''[http://archive.li/BFSng]</ref>\n\nThe Challicum bunyip, an outline image of a bunyip carved by Aborigines into the bank of Fiery Creek, near [[Ararat, Victoria|Ararat]], Victoria, was first recorded by ''The Australasian'' newspaper in 1851. According to the report, the bunyip had been speared after killing an Aboriginal man. Antiquarian Reynell Johns claimed that until the mid-1850s, Aboriginal people made a \"habit of visiting the place annually and retracing the outlines of the figure [of the bunyip] which is about 11 paces long and 4 paces in extreme breadth.\"<ref>Johns cited in {{harvnb|Holden|2001|p = 176}}</ref> The outline image no longer exists.{{sfn|Holden|2001|p = 176}}\n\n== Debate over origins of the bunyip ==\nNon-Aboriginal Australians have made various attempts to understand and explain the origins of the bunyip as a physical entity over the past 150 years. Writing in 1933, Charles Fenner suggested that it was likely that the \"actual origin of the bunyip myth lies in the fact that from time to time seals have made their way up the Murray and Darling (Rivers)\". He provided examples of seals found as far inland as [[Barmera, South Australia|Overland Corner]], [[Loxton, South Australia|Loxton]], and [[Conargo, New South Wales|Conargo]] and reminded readers that \"the smooth fur, prominent 'apricot' eyes, and the bellowing cry are characteristic of the seal\",{{sfn|Fenner|1933|pp = 2 \u2013 6}} especially [[southern elephant seal]]s and [[leopard seal]]s.<ref>[http://www.janesoceania.com/australia_bunyips_mythology1/index1.htm BUNYIP SIGHTINGS - IN SEARCH OF AN ORIGIN]</ref>\n\nAnother suggestion is that the bunyip may be a [[cultural memory]] of extinct Australian marsupials such as the ''[[Diprotodon]]'', ''[[Zygomaturus]]'', ''[[Nototherium]]'', or ''[[Palorchestes]]''. This connection was first formally made by Dr George Bennett of the Australian Museum in 1871.{{sfn|Holden|2001|p=90}} In the early 1990s, palaeontologist Pat Vickers-Rich and geologist Neil Archbold also cautiously suggested that Aboriginal legends \"perhaps had stemmed from an acquaintance with prehistoric bones or even living prehistoric animals themselves&nbsp;... When confronted with the remains of some of the now extinct Australian marsupials, Aborigines would often identify them as the bunyip.\"<ref name = PVR>{{citation |editor1-first = Pat |editor1-last = Vikers-Rich |editor2-first = J.M. |editor2-last = Monaghan |editor3-first = R.F.|editor3-last = Baird |editor4-first = T.H. |editor4-last = Rich |year = 1991 |title = Vertebrate Palaeontology of Australasia |page = 2 |publisher = Pioneer Design Studio and Monash University |isbn = 0-909674-36-1}}</ref> They also note that \"legends about the'' mihirung paringmal'' of western Victorian Aborigines&nbsp;... may allude to the&nbsp;... extinct giant birds the [[Dromornithidae]].\"<ref name = PVR/>\n\nIn a 2017 ''[[Australian Birdlife]]'' article, Karl Brandt suggested Aboriginal encounters with the [[southern cassowary]] inspired the myth.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Brandt|first1=Karl|title=Bunyip Hunters|journal=Australian Birdlife|date=June 2017|volume= 6|issue=2|page= 10}}</ref> According to the first written description of the bunyip from 1845,<ref name = \"firstuse\"/> the creature, which laid pale blue eggs of immense size, possessed deadly claws, powerful hind legs, a brightly coloured chest, and an [[emu]]-like head, characteristics shared with then undiscovered Australian cassowary. As the creature's bill was described as having serrated projections, each \"like the bone of the [[stingray]]\", this bunyip was associated with the indigenous people of [[Far North Queensland]], renowned for their spears tipped with stingray barbs and their proximity to the cassowary's Australian range.\n\nAnother association to the bunyip is the shy Australasian bittern (''[[Botaurus poiciloptilus]]'').{{sfn|Fenner|1933|p = 6}} During the breeding season, the male call of this marsh-dwelling bird is a \"low pitched boom\";<ref>{{citation |first1 = Ken |last1 = Simpson |first2 = Nicolas |last2 = Day |first3 = Peter |last3 = Trusler |year = 1999 |title = [[Field Guide to the Birds of Australia (Simpson & Day)|Field Guide to the Birds of Australia]] |page = 72 |publisher = Viking Books, Australia |isbn = 0-670-87918-5}}</ref> hence, it is occasionally called the \"bunyip bird\".<ref name = Oxford/>\n\n== Early accounts of European settlers ==\n[[File:Story of the bunyip 1882.jpg|thumb|right|An 1882 illustration of an Aboriginal man telling the story of the bunyip to two European children]]\n\nDuring the early settlement of Australia by Europeans, the notion became commonly held that the bunyip was an unknown animal that awaited discovery. Unfamiliar with the sights and sounds of the island continent's peculiar fauna, early Europeans believed that the bunyip described to them was one more strange Australian animal and they sometimes attributed unfamiliar animal calls or cries to it. Scholars suggest also that 19th-century bunyip lore was reinforced by imported European folklore, such as that of the Irish [[P\u00faca]].<ref name = Oxford/>\n\nA large number of bunyip sightings occurred during the 1840s and 1850s, particularly in the southeastern colonies of [[Colony of Victoria|Victoria]], [[Colony of New South Wales|New South Wales]] and [[Colony of South Australia|South Australia]], as European settlers extended their reach. The following is not an exhaustive list of accounts:\n\n=== Hume find of 1818 ===\nOne of the earliest accounts relating to a large unknown freshwater animal was in 1818,{{sfn|Holden|2001|p = 86}} when [[Hamilton Hume]] and James Meehan found some large bones at [[Lake Bathurst]] in [[New South Wales]]. They did not call the animal a bunyip, but described the remains indicating the creature as very much like a [[hippopotamus]] or [[manatee]].

Or she may be seen at night as a shrouded woman, crouched beneath the trees, lamenting with veiled face, or flying past in the moonlight, crying bitterly. And the cry of this spirit is mournful beyond all other sounds on earth, and betokens certain death to some member of the family whenever it is heard in the silence of the night.<ref>Wilde, Jane (1887).

Boston: Ticknor and Co. pp. 259\u201360.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n==Keening==\nIn Ireland and parts of Scotland, a traditional part of mourning is the [[keening]] woman (''bean chaointe''), who wails a lament - in {{lang-ga|Caoineadh}}, {{IPA-ga|'k\u0270i\u02d0n\u02b2i}} (Munster dialect), {{IPA-ga|\u02c8k\u0270i\u02d0n\u02b2\u0259|}} (Connaught dialect) or {{IPA-ga|\u02c8ki\u02d0n\u02b2u\u02d0|}} (Ulster dialect), ''caoin'' meaning \"to weep, to wail\". This keening woman may in some cases be a professional, and the best keeners would be in high demand.\n\nIrish legend speaks of a lament being sung by a fairy woman; she would sing it when a family member died or was about to die, even if the person had died far away and news of their death had not yet come, so that the wailing of the banshee was the first warning the household had of the death.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/644410117|title=Celtic culture : a historical encyclopedia|last=T.|first=Koch, John|date=2006-01-01|publisher=ABC CLIO|year=|isbn=9781851094400|location=|pages=189|oclc=644410117|quote=[Its occurrence] is most strongly associated with the old family or ancestral home and land, even when a family member dies abroad.

EPA regulations also require seed companies to train farmers how to maintain refuges, to collect data on the refuges and to report that data to the EPA.<ref name=Witowski/> A study of these reports found that from 2003 to 2005 farmer compliance with keeping refuges was above 90%, but that by 2008 approximately 25% of Bt corn farmers did not keep refuges properly, raising concerns that resistance would develop.<ref name=Witowski/>\n\nUnmodified crops received most of the economic benefits of Bt corn in the US in 1996-2007, because of the overall reduction of pest populations. This reduction came because females laid eggs on modified and unmodified strains alike.<ref name=sci1009/>\n\nSeed bags containing both Bt and refuge seed have been approved by the EPA in the United States. These seed mixtures were marketed as \"Refuge in a Bag\" (RIB) to increase farmer compliance with refuge requirements and reduce additional work needed at planting from having separate Bt and refuge seed bags on hand. The EPA approved a lower percentage of refuge seed in these seed mixtures ranging from 5 to 10%. This strategy is likely to reduce the likelihood of Bt-resistance occurring for [[corn rootworm]], but may increase the risk of resistance for [[lepidopteran]] pests, such as [[European corn borer]]. Increased concerns for resistance with seed mixtures include partially resistant larvae on a Bt plant being able to move to a susceptible plant to survive or cross pollination of refuge pollen on to Bt plants that can lower the amount of Bt expressed in kernels for ear feeding insects.<ref name=\"Siegfried\">{{cite journal |last=Siegfried|first=B.D.|title= Understanding successful resistance management |journal= GM Crops & Food |volume= 3 |issue= 3 |pages= 184\u2013193 |year= 2012 |url= http://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1060&context=ent_pubs |doi=10.4161/gmcr.20715|display-authors=etal}}</ref><ref name=\"Devos\">{{cite journal |last= Devos|first=Y.|title= Resistance evolution to the first generation of genetically modified Diabrotica-active Bt-maize events by western corn rootworm: management and monitoring considerations |journal= Transgenic Research |volume= 22  |pages= 269\u2013299 |year= 2013 |url= http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2247&context=usdaarsfacpub |doi=10.1007/s11248-012-9657-4|display-authors=etal |pmid=23011587}}</ref>\n\n== Resistance ==\nResistant strains of the European corn borer have developed in areas with defective or absent refuge management.<ref name=sci1009>{{Cite journal | last1 = Tabashnik | first1 = B.

Anyhow, this represents a notable advance in comparison with the lack of studies published in recent years in scientific journals by those companies.\"|pmid=21296423}}<p>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.tufts.edu/~skrimsky/PDF/Illusory%20Consensus%20GMOs.PDF|title=An Illusory Consensus behind GMO Health Assessment|first=Sheldon|last=Krimsky|journal=Science, Technology, & Human Values|pages=1\u201332|doi=10.1177/0162243915598381|date=2015|quote=\"I began this article with the testimonials from respected scientists that there is literally no scientific controversy over the health effects of GMOs.

These pathogens fall into two broad categories, bloodborne (carried in the body fluids) and airborne.

Every patient was treated as if infected and therefore precautions were taken to minimize risk. Other conditions which called for minimizing risks with BSI:\n\n* Diseases with air-borne transmission (e.g., [[tuberculosis]])\n* Diseases with droplet transmission (e.g., [[mumps]], [[rubella]], [[influenza]], [[pertussis]])\n* Transmission by direct or indirect contact with dried skin (e.g., colonisation with [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]]) or contaminated surfaces\n* [[Prion]] diseases (e.g., [[Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease]])\nor any combination of the above.\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Barrier nursing]]\n\n== Further reading ==\n*{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/hicpac/2007IP/2007isolationPrecautions.html |title=CDC - 2007 Isolation Precautions - HICPAC |work=Center For Disease Control}}\n*{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/biosafety/ |title=CDC - Biosafety Home |work=Center For Disease Control |accessdate=}}\n\n{{Health care}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Body Substance Isolation}}\n[[Category:Medical hygiene]]", "sha1": "f8t5p7nbgykepwcnwree432zxkbl2w5"}}, {"title": "Boudica", "ns": "0", "id": "4517", "revision": {"id": "866643598", "parentid": "866615193", "timestamp": "2018-10-31T16:34:23Z", "contributor": {"username": "Richard Keatinge", "id": "1179038"}, "comment": "sources further up page, minor changes", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{redirect|Boudicca|the cruise ship|MV Boudicca}}\n{{redirect|Boadicea}}\n{{for|the 2003 film also known as \"Warrior Queen\"|Boudica (film)}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2012}}\n{{Infobox person\n|image = Boadicea Haranguing the Britons (called Boudicca, or Boadicea) by John Opie.jpg\n|image_size =\n|caption = Queen Boudica in [[John Opie]]'s painting ''Boadicea Haranguing the Britons''\n|birth_date =\n|birth_place = [[Roman Britain|Britannia]]\n|death_date = {{Circa|60}} or 61 AD\n|other_names = Boudicea, Boadicea, Buddug\n|occupation = Queen of the [[Iceni]]\n|spouse = [[Prasutagus]]\n}}\n\n'''Boudica''' or '''Boudicca''' ([[Latinisation of names|Latinised]] as '''Boadicea''' or '''Boudicea''' {{IPAc-en|b|o\u028a|d|\u1d7b|\u02c8|s|i\u02d0|\u0259}}, and known in [[Welsh language|Welsh]] as '''{{lang|cy|Buddug}}''' {{IPA-cy|\u02c8b\u0268\u031e\u00f0\u0268\u031e\u0261}})<ref>{{Cite book|author=[[John Davies (historian)|John Davies]]|title=A History of Wales|publisher=Penguin|year=1993 |location=London, UK|page=28|isbn=0-14-014581-8 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=The Warrior Queens|last=Fraser|first=Antonia|publisher=Penguin books|year=1990|isbn=0 14008517 3|location=Penguin books Canada Ltd,20801 John street,markham,Ontario L3R 1B4|pages=3.4}}</ref> was a queen of the [[Celtic Britons|British]] [[Celts|Celtic]] [[Iceni]] tribe who led an uprising against the occupying forces of the [[Roman Empire]] in AD 60 or 61, and died shortly after its failure, having supposedly poisoned herself.

During Claudius's conquest of southern Britain in AD 43, the Iceni initially allied with Rome.

Ostorius defeated them and went on to put down other uprisings around Britain.<ref>Tacitus, ''The Annals'', 12.31-32</ref> The Iceni remained independent, under Prasutagus.

Tacitus wrote, \"The Icenian king Prasutagus, celebrated for his long prosperity, had named the emperor his heir, together with his two daughters; an act of deference which he thought would place his kingdom and household beyond the risk of injury. The result was contrary \u2014 so much so that his kingdom was pillaged by centurions, his household by slaves; as though they had been prizes of war.\" He added that Boudica was lashed, her two daughters were raped, and that the estates of the leading Iceni men were confiscated.<ref name=\"Tacitus, The Annals, 14.31\">Tacitus, ''The Annals'', 14.31</ref> Cassius Dio wrote: \"An excuse for the war was found in the confiscation of the sums of money that Claudius had given to the foremost Britons; for these sums, as [[Catus Decianus|Decianus Catus]], the procurator of the island maintained, were to be paid back.\" He also said that another reason was \"the fact that [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], in the hope of receiving a good rate of interest, had lent to the islanders 40,000,000 sesterces that they did not want, and had afterwards called in this loan all at once and had resorted to severe measures in exacting it.\"<ref>Cassius Dio, ''Roman History'', 62.2</ref>\n\n=== Boudica's uprising ===\nIn AD 60 or 61, while the current governor, [[Gaius Suetonius Paulinus]], was leading a campaign against the island of {{lang|la|Mona}} (modern [[Anglesey]]) in the north of Wales, which was a refuge for British rebels and a stronghold of the [[druid]]s, the Iceni conspired with their neighbours the Trinovantes, amongst others, to revolt. Boudica was chosen as their leader. Tacitus records that she addressed her army with these words, \"It is not as a woman descended from noble ancestry, but as one of the people that I am avenging lost freedom, my scourged body, the outraged chastity of my daughters,\" and concluded, \"This is a woman's resolve; as for men, they may live and be slaves.\"<ref name=\":0\">Tacitus, Publius, Cornelius, The Annals, Book 14, Chapter 35</ref> According to Tacitus, they drew inspiration from the example of [[Arminius]], the prince of the [[Cherusci]] who had driven the Romans out of Germany in AD 9, and their own ancestors who had driven [[Julius Caesar]] from Britain.<ref>Tacitus, {{lang|la|Agricola}} [[s:Agricola#15|15]]</ref> Dio says that at the outset Boudica employed a form of [[divination]], releasing a [[hare]] from the folds of her dress and interpreting the direction in which it ran, and invoked [[Andraste]], a British [[goddess]] of [[Victoria (mythology)|victory]].\n\nThe rebels' first target was {{lang|la|[[Camulodunum#Iceni Revolt|Camulodunum]]}} ([[Colchester]]), the former Trinovantian capital and, at that time, a Roman {{lang|la|[[Colonia (Roman)|colonia]]}}. The Roman veterans who had been settled there had mistreated the locals, and a temple to the former emperor [[Claudius]] had been erected there at local expense, making the city a focus for resentment. The Roman inhabitants sought reinforcements from the procurator, Catus Decianus, but he sent only two hundred [[Auxiliaries (Roman military)|auxiliary troops]].

Suetonius, however, with wonderful resolution, marched amidst a hostile population to Londinium, which, though undistinguished by the name of a colony, was much frequented by a number of merchants and trading vessels. Uncertain whether he should choose it as a seat of war, as he looked round on his scanty force of soldiers, and remembered with what a serious warning the rashness of Petillius had been punished, he resolved to save the province at the cost of a single town. Nor did the tears and weeping of the people, as they implored his aid, deter him from giving the signal of departure and receiving into his army all who would go with him.

Dio says that, even if they were lined up one deep, they would not have extended the length of Boudica's line. By now the rebel forces were said to have numbered 230,000-300,000. However, this number should be treated with scepticism&nbsp;\u2014 Dio's account is known only from a late [[epitome]]. \n\nBoudica exhorted her troops from her [[chariot]], her daughters beside her. Tacitus records her giving a short speech in which she presents herself not as an [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]] avenging her lost wealth, but as an ordinary person, avenging her lost freedom, her battered body, and the abused chastity of her daughters. She said their cause was just, and the deities were on their side; the one legion that had dared to face them had been destroyed. She, a woman, was resolved to win or die; if the men wanted to live in slavery, that was their choice.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n<blockquote>At first, the legionaries stood motionless, keeping to the defile as a natural protection: then, when the closer advance of the enemy had enabled them to exhaust their missiles with certitude of aim, they dashed forward in a wedge-like formation. The auxiliaries charged in the same style; and the cavalry, with lances extended, broke a way through any parties of resolute men whom they encountered. The remainder took to flight, although escape was difficult, as the cordon of wagons had blocked the outlets. The troops gave no quarter even to the women: the baggage animals themselves had been speared and added to the pile of bodies. The glory won in the course of the day was remarkable, and equal to that of our older victories: for, by some accounts, little less than eighty thousand Britons fell, at a cost of some four hundred Romans killed and a not much greater number of wounded. Boudica ended her days by poison; while [[Poenius Postumus]], camp-prefect of the second legion, informed of the exploits of the men of the fourteenth and twentieth, and conscious that he had cheated his own corps of a share in the honours and had violated the rules of the service by ignoring the orders of his commander, ran his sword through his body.<ref name=\":0\" /></blockquote>\n\nAccording to Tacitus in his ''Annals'', Boudica poisoned herself, though in the {{lang|la|Agricola}} which was written almost twenty years before the ''Annals'' he mentions nothing of suicide and attributes the end of the revolt to {{lang|la|socordia}} (\"indolence\"); Dio says she fell sick and died and then was given a lavish burial.\n\n[[Catus Decianus]], who had fled to Gaul, was replaced by [[Gaius Julius Alpinus Classicianus]].

In post-war Argentina, success of the Birome ballpoint was limited, but in mid-1945, the ''Eversharp'' Co., a maker of [[mechanical pencil]]s, teamed up with [[Eberhard Faber]] Co. to license the rights from Birome for sales in the United States.<ref name=\"About\"/><ref name=\"1940s\"/>\n\nDuring the same period, American entrepreneur [[Milton Reynolds]] came across a Birome ballpoint pen during a business trip to [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina.<ref name=\"About\"/><ref name=\"1940s\"/> Recognizing commercial potential, he purchased several ballpoint samples, returned to the United States, and founded ''[[Milton Reynolds#The Reynolds International Pen Company|Reynolds International Pen Company]]''. Reynolds bypassed the Birome patent with sufficient design alterations to obtain an American patent, beating Eversharp and other competitors to introduce the pen to the U.S. market.<ref name=\"About\"/><ref name=\"1940s\"/> Debuting at [[Gimbels]] department store in New York City on 29 October 1945,<ref name=\"1940s\"/> for US$12.50 each (1945 US dollar value, about ${{Inflation|US|12.50|1945}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars),<ref name=\"1940s\"/> ''Reynolds Rocket'' became the first commercially successful ballpoint pen.<ref name=\"About\"/><ref name=\"How ballpoints work\"/><ref>{{cite book|title=Inventing the 20th century: 100 inventions that shaped the world|year=2002|publisher=NYU Press|author=Stephen Van Dulken|author2=Andrew Phillips|page=106}}</ref> Reynolds went to great extremes to market the pen, with great success; Gimbel's sold many thousands of pens within one week. In Britain, the Miles Martin pen company was producing the first commercially successful ballpoint pens there by the end of 1945.<ref name=\"About\"/>\n\nNeither Reynolds' nor Eversharp's ballpoint lived up to consumer expectations in America. Ballpoint pen sales peaked in 1946, and consumer interest subsequently plunged due to market-saturation.<ref name=\"1940s\"/> By the early 1950s the ballpoint boom had subsided and Reynolds' company folded.<ref name=\"About\"/>\n\n[[Paper Mate]] pens, among the emerging ballpoint brands of the 1950s, bought the rights to distribute their own ballpoint pens in Canada.<ref name=\"intrigue\"/> Facing concerns about ink-reliability, Paper Mate pioneered new ink formulas and advertised them as \"banker-approved\".<ref name=\"1940s\"/> In 1954, [[Parker Pens]] released ''[[Jotter|The Jotter]]''\u2014the company's first ballpoint\u2014boasting additional features and technological advances which also included the use of tungsten-carbide textured ball-bearings in their pens.<ref name=\"About\"/> In less than a year, Parker sold several million pens at prices between three and nine dollars.<ref name=\"About\"/> In the 1960s, the failing [[Eversharp|Eversharp Co.]] sold its pen division to Parker and ultimately folded.<ref name=\"About\"/>\n\n[[Marcel Bich]] also introduced a ballpoint pen to the American marketplace in the 1950s, licensed from B\u00edr\u00f3 and based on the Argentine designs.<ref name=\"bpp encyc\"/><ref name=\"Phaidon\"/> Bich shortened his name to Bic in 1953, becoming the ballpoint brand now recognised globally.<ref name=\"How ballpoints work\"/> Bic pens struggled until the company launched its \"Writes The First Time, Every Time!\" advertising campaign in the 1960s.<ref name=\"How ballpoints work\"/> Competition during this era forced unit prices to drop considerably.<ref name=\"How ballpoints work\"/>\n\n==Inks==\nBallpoint pen ink is normally a paste containing around 25 to 40 percent dye. The dyes are suspended in a solvent of \"oil\". The most common of the oils are [[benzyl alcohol]] or [[phenoxyethanol]], which mix with the dyes to create a smooth paste that dries quickly. The dyes used in blue and black ballpoint pens are basic dyes based on [[triarylmethane]] and acid dyes derived from diazo compounds or [[phthalocyanine]]. Common dyes in blue (and black) ink are [[Prussian blue]], Victoria blue, [[methyl violet]], [[crystal violet]] and [[phthalocyanine blue]]. The dye [[eosin]] is commonly used for red ink.\n\nThe inks are resistant to water after drying but can be defaced by certain solvents.\n\n==Types of ballpoint pens==\n[[Image:4 Bic Cristal pens and caps.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bic Cristal]] ballpoint pens shown in four basic ink colours.]]\n[[File:Jinhao 182 twist action ballpoint pen disassembled.jpg|thumb|right|Twist action ballpoint pen with large capacity G2 type refill.]]\n[[File:Ball point pen refills en.png|thumb|right|Various commonly used ballpoint refill types.]]\n\nBallpoint pens are produced in both disposable and refillable models. Refills allow for the entire internal ink reservoir, including a ballpoint and socket, to be replaced. Such characteristics are usually associated with designer-type pens or those constructed of finer materials. The simplest types of ballpoint pens are disposable and have a cap to cover the tip when the pen is not in use, or a mechanism for retracting the tip,<ref name=\"bpp encyc\"/> which varies between manufacturers but is usually a spring- or screw-mechanism.\n\n[[Rollerball pen]]s employ the same ballpoint mechanics, but with the use of water-based inks instead of oil-based inks. Compared to oil-based ballpoints, rollerball pens are said to provide more fluid ink-flow, but the water-based inks will blot if held stationary against the writing surface. Water-based inks also remain wet longer when freshly applied and are thus prone to ''smearing''\u2014posing problems to left-handed people (or right handed people writing [[right-to-left]] script)\u2014and ''running'', should the writing surface become wet.\n\nSome ballpoint pens use a hybrid ink formulation whose viscosity is lower than that of standard ballpoint ink, but greater than rollerball ink. The ink dries faster than a standard ballpoint to prevent smearing when writing. These pens are better suited for left handed persons. Examples are the Uni Jetstream and Pilot Acroball ranges. These pens are also labelled \"extra smooth\", as they offer a smoother writing experience compared to normal ballpoint pens. \n\nBecause of a ballpoint pen's reliance on gravity to coat the ball with ink, most cannot be used to write upside-down. However, technology developed by Fisher pens in the United States resulted in the production of what came to be known as the \"Fisher [[Space Pen]]\". Space Pens combine a more viscous ink with a pressurised ink reservoir<ref name=\"How ballpoints work\"/> that forces the ink toward the point. Unlike standard ballpoints, the rear end of a Space Pen's pressurized reservoir is sealed, eliminating evaporation and leakage,<ref name=\"How ballpoints work\"/> thus allowing the pen to write upside-down, in zero-gravity environments, and reportedly underwater.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spacepen.com/about-us.aspx|title=Fisher Space Pen \u2013 About Us|accessdate=5 November 2011}}</ref> Astronauts have made use of these pens in outer space.<ref name=\"How ballpoints work\"/>\n\nBallpoint pens with erasable ink were pioneered by the [[Paper Mate]] pen company.<ref name=\"Erasable\"/> The ink formulas of erasable ballpoints have properties similar to [[rubber cement]], allowing the ink to be literally rubbed clean from the writing surface before drying and eventually becoming permanent.<ref name=\"Erasable\"/> Erasable ink is much thicker than standard ballpoint inks, requiring pressurised cartridges to facilitate inkflow\u2014meaning they can also write upside-down. Though these pens are equipped with erasers, any eraser will suffice.<ref name=\"Erasable\"/>\n\nThe inexpensive, disposable [[Bic Cristal]] (also simply ''Bic pen'' or ''Biro'') is reportedly the most widely sold pen in the world.<ref name=\"Phaidon\">''Phaidon Design Classics- Volume 2'', 2006 Phaidon Press Ltd. {{ISBN|0-7148-4399-7}}</ref><ref name=\"Humble\">[http://www.moma.org/exhibitions/2004/pdfs/humble_checklist.pdf ''Humble Masterpieces''] \u2013 [[The Museum of Modern Art]] New York, 8 April \u2013 27 September 2004.</ref> It was the Bic company's first product and is still synonymous with the company name.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/BIC-Corporation-Company-History.html|title=BIC Corporation \u2013 Company History |publisher=Fundinguniverse.com|date= |accessdate=17 August 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bicworld.com/en/bic-group/history/ |title=History |publisher=Bicworld.com|date= |accessdate=17 August 2011}}</ref> The Bic Cristal is part of the permanent collection at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in [[New York City]], acknowledged for its [[industrial design]].<ref name=\"Bic Cristal in MoMA collection\"/><ref name=\"Humble\"/> Its hexagonal barrel mimics that of a wooden [[pencil]] and is transparent, showing the ink level in the reservoir.

Sometimes ballpoint refills are combined with another non-ballpoint refill.\n\nSometimes ballpoint pens combine a ballpoint tip on one end and touchscreen stylus on the other.\n\nBallpoint pens are sometimes provided free by businesses, such as hotels, as a form of advertising\u2014printed with a company's name; a ballpoint pen is a relatively low cost advertisement that is highly effective (customers will use, and therefore see, a pen daily). Businesses and charities include ballpoint pens in direct mail campaigns to increase a customer's interest in the mailing. Ballpoints have also been produced to commemorate events, such as a pen commemorating the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy.<ref name=\"bpp encyc\"/>\n\n==As art medium==\n{{Main|Ballpoint pen artwork}}\n[[File:McQueen ballpoint biro drawing art.jpg|thumb|Example of a ballpoint pen work-in-progress \u2013 rendering of actor [[Steve McQueen]] by artist James Mylne.]]\n[[File:Lennie Mace \"Uchuu Neko Parade\" 2005 Tokyo, ballpoint \"Penting\" 130x92cm.jpg|thumb|Ballpoint \"''PENting''\" by [[Lennie Mace]], Uchuu Neko Parade (2005) ballpoint pen and hardware on paper.]]\n\nBallpoint pens have proven to be a versatile [[art medium]] for professional artists as well as amateur [[doodle]]rs.<ref name=\"NYT\"/> Low cost, availability, and portability are cited by practitioners as qualities which make this common writing tool a convenient, alternative art supply.<ref name=\"Oddity\"/> Some artists use them within [[mixed-media]] works, while others use them solely as their medium-of-choice.<ref name=\"Tricks\"/>\n\nEffects not generally associated with ballpoint pens can be achieved.<ref name=\"Weekender\"/> Traditional [[pen|pen-and-ink]] techniques such as [[stipple|stippling]] and [[cross-hatching]] can be used to create half-tones<ref name=\"Mylne\"/> or the illusion of form and volume.<ref name=\"Art of Sketching\"/> For artists whose interests necessitate precision line-work, ballpoints are an obvious attraction; ballpoint pens allow for sharp lines not as effectively executed using a brush.<ref name=\"Japan Times\"/> Finely applied, the resulting imagery has been mistaken for airbrushed artwork<ref name=\"Tokyo Journal\"/> and photography,<ref name=\"Telegraph\"/> causing reactions of disbelief which ballpoint artist [[Lennie Mace]] refers to as the ''Wow Factor''.<ref name=\"Japan Times\"/><ref name=\"Tokyo Journal\"/>\n\nFamous 20th-century artists such as [[Andy Warhol]], among others, have utilised ballpoint pens to some extent during their careers.<ref name=\"Warhol BPP\"/> Ballpoint pen artwork continues to attract interest in the 21st century, with [[contemporary]] artists gaining recognition for their specific use of ballpoint pens; for their technical proficiency, imagination, and innovation. Korean-American artist [[Il Lee]] has been creating large-scale, ballpoint-only abstract artwork since the late 1970s.<ref name=\"NYT\"/> Since the 1980s, [[Lennie Mace]] creates imaginative, ballpoint-only artwork of varying content and complexity, applied to unconventional surfaces including wood and denim.<ref name=\"Gekkan\"/> The artist coined terms such as ''PENtings'' and ''Media Graffiti'' to describe his varied output.<ref name=\"Japan Times\"/> More recently, British artist [[James Mylne (artist)|James Mylne]] has been creating photo-realistic artwork using mostly black ballpoints, sometimes with minimal mixed-media color.<ref name=\"Telegraph\"/> In the mid-2000s (decade), [[Juan Francisco Casas]] generated Internet attention for a series of large-scale, [[photorealism|photo-realistic]] ballpoint duplications of his own [[snapshot (photography)|snapshots]] of friends, utilising only blue pens.<ref name=\"Casas\"/>\n\nUsing ballpoint pens to create artwork is not without limitations. Color availability and sensitivity of ink to light are among concerns of ballpoint pen artists.<ref name=\"Care\"/> Mistakes pose greater risks to ballpoint artists; once a line is drawn, it generally cannot be erased.<ref name=\"Japan Times\"/> Additionally, \"blobbing\" of ink on the drawing surface and \"skipping\" of ink-flow require consideration when using ballpoint pens for artistic purposes.<ref name=\"Tricks\"/> Although the mechanics of ballpoint pens remain relatively unchanged, ink composition has evolved to solve certain problems over the years, resulting in unpredictable sensitivity to light and some extent of fading.<ref name=\"Care\"/>\n\n==Manufacturing==\n[[File:Ink holder of a ballpen.jpg|thumb|300px|The ink holder of a disposable ballpoint pen.]]\nAlthough designs and construction vary between brands, basic components of all ballpoint pens are universal.<ref name=\"bpp encyc\"/> Standard components of a ballpoint tip include the freely rotating ''ball'' itself (distributing the ink on the writing surface), a ''socket'' holding the ball in place, small ''ink channels'' that provide ink to the ball through the socket, and a self-contained ''ink reservoir'' supplying ink to the ball.<ref name=\"How ballpoints work\"/> In modern disposable pens, narrow plastic tubes contain the ink, which is compelled downward to the ball by gravity.<ref name=\"How ballpoints work\"/> Brass, steel, or tungsten carbide are used to manufacture the ball bearing-like points,<ref name=\"How ballpoints work\"/> then housed in a brass socket.<ref name=\"Incredible Pen\"/>\n\nThe function of these components can be compared with the ball-applicator of roll-on antiperspirant; the same technology at a larger scale. The ballpoint tip delivers the ink to the writing surface while acting as a ''buffer'' between the ink in the reservoir and the air outside, preventing the quick-drying ink from drying inside the reservoir. Modern ballpoints are said to have a two-year shelf life, on average.<ref name=\"How ballpoints work\"/>\n\nA ballpoint tip that can write comfortably for a long period of time is not easy to produce as it requires high-precision machinery and thin high grade steel alloy plates. China, which currently (2017) produces about 80 percent of the world's ballpoint pens, relied up to 2017 on imported ballpoint tips and metal alloys.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/01/18/finally-china-manufactures-a-ballpoint-pen-all-by-itself/ |title=Finally, China manufactures a ballpoint pen all by itself |publisher=washingtonpost.com |date=18 January 2017 |accessdate=21 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe common ballpoint pen is a product of [[mass production]], with components produced separately on assembly lines.<ref name=\"Incredible Pen\"/> Basic steps in the manufacturing process include the production of ink formulas, moulding of metal and plastic components, and assembly.<ref name=\"bpp encyc\"/> [[Marcel Bich]] was involved in developing the production of inexpensive ballpoint pens.<ref name=\"How ballpoints work\"/>\n\n===Standards===\nThe [[International Organization for Standardization]] has published standards for ball point and roller ball pens:\n\n; ISO 12756:1998: Drawing and writing instruments \u2013 Ball point pens \u2013 Vocabulary<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/en/CatalogueDetailPage.CatalogueDetail?CSNUMBER=27200&ICS1=1&ICS2=100&ICS3=40 |title=ISO 12756:1998 \u2013 Drawing and writing instruments \u2013 Ball point pens and roller ball pens \u2013 Vocabulary |publisher=Iso.org |date=12 June 2009 |accessdate=11 September 2010}}</ref>\n; ISO 12757-1:1998: Ball point pens and refills \u2013 Part 1: General use<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/en/CatalogueDetailPage.CatalogueDetail?CSNUMBER=1129&ICS1=97&ICS2=180&ICS3= |title=ISO 12757-1:1998 \u2013 Ball point pens and refills \u2013 Part 1: General use |publisher=Iso.org |date=12 June 2009 |accessdate=11 September 2010}}</ref>\n; ISO 12757-2:1998: Ball point pens and refills \u2013 Part 2: Documentary use (DOC)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/en/CatalogueDetailPage.CatalogueDetail?CSNUMBER=23718&ICS1=1&ICS2=100&ICS3=40 |title=ISO 12757-2:1998 \u2013 Ball point pens and refills \u2013 Part 2: Documentary use (DOC) |publisher=Iso.org |date=12 June 2009 |accessdate=11 September 2010}}</ref>\n; ISO 14145-1:1998: Roller ball pens and refills \u2013 Part 1: General use<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/en/CatalogueDetailPage.CatalogueDetail?CSNUMBER=23719&ICS1=97&ICS2=180&ICS3= |title=ISO 14145-1:1998 \u2013 Roller ball pens and refills \u2013 Part 1: General use |publisher=Iso.org |date=12 June 2009 |accessdate=11 September 2010}}</ref>\n; ISO 14145-2:1998: Roller ball pens and refills \u2013 Part 2: Documentary use (DOC)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/en/CatalogueDetailPage.CatalogueDetail?CSNUMBER=23720&ICS1=1&ICS2=100&ICS3=40 |title=ISO 14145-2:1998 \u2013 Roller ball pens and refills \u2013 Part 2: Documentary use (DOC) |publisher=Iso.org |date=12 June 2009 |accessdate=11 September 2010}}</ref>\n\n== Guinness World Records ==\n\n* The world's largest functioning ballpoint pen was made by Acharya Makunuri Srinivasa in India.

The company was founded in 1886 as the [[American Arithmometer Company]], and after the 1986 merger with [[UNIVAC|Sperry UNIVAC]] was renamed [[Unisys]]. The company's history paralleled many of the major developments in [[history of computing|computing]]. At its start, it produced mechanical [[adding machine]]s, and later moved into programmable ledgers and then computers. It was one of the largest producers of [[mainframe computer]]s in the world, also producing related equipment including [[typewriter]]s and [[Printer (computing)|printer]]s.\n\n==Early history==\n[[File:Burrough's Adding Machines, 1914.jpg|thumb|<center>1914 advertisement</center>]]\n[[File:BurroughsCorporationAddingMachine.jpg|thumb|upright|An early Burroughs [[adding machine]] ]]\n[[File:1890s adding machine.jpg|thumb|150px|Desktop model in use around 1910]]\nIn 1886, the American Arithmometer Company was established in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]] to produce and sell an [[adding machine]] invented by [[William Seward Burroughs I|William Seward Burroughs]] (grandfather of [[Beat Generation]] author [[William S. Burroughs]]). In 1904, six years after Burroughs' death, the company moved to Detroit and changed its name to the Burroughs Adding Machine Company. It was soon the biggest adding machine company in America.\n\n==Evolving product lines==\n\nThe adding machine range began with the basic, hand-cranked P100 which was only capable of adding. The design included some revolutionary features, foremost of which was the [[dashpot]]. The P200 offered a subtraction capability and the P300 provided a means of keeping 2 separate totals. The P400 provided a moveable carriage, and the P600 and top-of-the-range P612 offered some limited programmability based upon the position of the carriage. The range was further extended by the inclusion of the \"J\" series which provided a single finger calculation facility, and the \"c\" series of both manual and electrical assisted [[comptometer]]s. In the late 1960s, the Burroughs sponsored [[Nixie tube|\"nixi-tube\"]] provided an electronic display calculator. Burroughs developed a range of adding machines with different capabilities, gradually increasing in their capabilities. A revolutionary adding machine was the ''Sensimatic'', which was able to perform many business functions semi-automatically. It had a moving programmable carriage to maintain [[general ledger|ledgers]]. It could store 9, 18 or 27 [[Trial balance|balances]] during the ledger posting operations and worked with a mechanical adder named a Crossfooter. The Sensimatic developed into the ''Sensitronic'' which could store balances on a [[Magnetic stripe card|magnetic stripe]] which was part of the ledger card. This balance was read into the accumulator when the card was inserted into the carriage. The Sensitronic was followed by the E1000, E2000, E3000, E4000, E6000 and the E8000, which were computer systems supporting  card reader/punches and a [[line printer]].\n\nLater, Burroughs was selling more than adding machines, including typewriters. But the biggest shift in company history came in 1953: the Burroughs Adding Machine Company was renamed the Burroughs Corporation and began moving into computer products, initially for banking institutions. This move began with Burroughs' purchase in June 1956, of the [[ElectroData Corporation]] in [[Pasadena, California]], a spinoff of the Consolidated Engineering Corporation which had designed test instruments and had a cooperative relationship with [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]] in Pasadena.<ref name=\"Sawyer\">Sawyer, T.J., [http://tjsawyer.com/B205Home.htm \"Burroughs 205 HomePage\"]</ref> ElectroData had built the [[Datatron|Datatron 205]] and was working on the Datatron 220.<ref name=\"Sawyer\"/> The first major computer product that came from this marriage was the B205 tube computer. In the late 1960s the L and TC series range was produced (e.g. the [[Burroughs TC500|TC500]]\u2014Terminal Computer 500) which had a [[IBM Selectric typewriter|golf ball printer]] and in the beginning a 1K (64 bit) disk [[Computer memory|memory]]. These were popular as branch [[Computer terminal|terminal]]s to the B5500/6500/6700 systems, and sold well in the banking sector, where they were often connected to non-Burroughs mainframes. In conjunction with these products, Burroughs also manufactured an extensive range of cheque processing equipment, normally attached as terminals to a larger system such as a B2700 or B1700.\n\n==A force in the computing industry==\nBurroughs was one of the nine major United States computer companies in the 1960s, with [[IBM]] the largest, [[Honeywell]], [[NCR Corporation]], [[Control Data Corporation]] (CDC), [[General Electric]] (GE), [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC), [[RCA]] and [[Sperry Rand]] ([[UNIVAC]] line). In terms of sales, Burroughs was always a distant second to [[IBM]]. In fact, IBM's market share was so much larger than all of the others that this group was often referred to as \"IBM and the Seven Dwarfs.\"<ref>\n{{cite web|\nurl=http://www.dvorak.org/blog/ibm-and-the-seven-dwarfs-dwarf-one-burroughs/ |\ntitle=IBM and the Seven Dwarfs \u2014 Dwarf One: Burroughs|\npublisher=Dvorak Uncensored|\nauthor=[[John C. Dvorak|Dvorak, John C.]]|\ndate=2006-11-25|\naccessdate=2010-02-04}}</ref> By 1972 when GE and RCA were no longer in the mainframe business, the remaining five companies behind IBM became known as the [[BUNCH]], an [[acronym]] based on their initials.\n\nAt the same time, Burroughs was very much a competitor. Like IBM, Burroughs tried to supply a complete line of products for its customers, including Burroughs-designed printers, [[disk drive]]s, [[tape drive]]s, computer printing paper, and even [[typewriter ribbon]]s.\n\nIn the 1950s, Burroughs worked with the [[Federal Reserve Bank]] on the development and computer processing of [[magnetic ink character recognition]] (MICR) especially for the processing of bank cheques. Burroughs made special MICR/OCR sorter/readers which attached to their medium systems line of computers ([[Burroughs B2000|2700/3700/4700]]) and this entrenched the company in the computer side of the banking industry.\n\n===Developments and innovations===\nThe Burroughs Corporation developed three highly innovative [[computer architecture|architectures]], based on the design philosophy of \"[[language-directed design]]\". Their machine instruction sets favored one or many [[high level programming languages]], such as [[ALGOL]], [[COBOL]] or [[FORTRAN]]. All three architectures were considered [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] class machines:\n* The [[Burroughs large systems]] machines started with the B5000 in 1961. The B5500 came a few years later when large rotating disks replaced drums as the main external memory media.  These B5000 Series systems used the world's first virtual memory multi-programming operating system.  They were followed by the B6500/B6700 in the later 1960s, the B7700 in the mid 1970s, and the A series in the 1980s. The underlying architecture of these machines is similar and continues today as the [[Unisys]] ClearPath MCP line of computers: [[stack machine]]s designed to be programmed in an extended [[Algol 60]]. Their [[operating system]]s, called MCP ([[MCP (Burroughs Large Systems)|Master Control Program]]&mdash;the name later borrowed by the screenwriters for ''[[Tron]]''), were programmed in [[Executive Systems Problem Oriented Language|ESPOL]] (Executive Systems Programming Oriented Language, a minor extension of ALGOL), and later in NEWP (with further extensions to ALGOL) almost a decade before [[Unix]]. The command interface developed into a compiled [[Structured programming|structured language]] with declarations, statements and procedures called WFL ([[Work Flow Language]]). Many [[computer scientist]]s consider these series of computers to be technologically groundbreaking. Stack oriented processors, with 48 bit word length where each word was defined as data or program contributed significantly to a secure operating environment, long before [[spyware]] and [[Computer virus|viruses]] affected computing. And the modularity of these large systems was also unique: multiple [[CPU]]s, multiple memory modules and multiple [[I/O]] and Data Comm processors permitted incremental and [[cost effective]] growth of system performance and reliability. In industries like banking, where continuous operations was mandatory, Burroughs large systems penetrated most every large bank, including the [[Federal Reserve Bank]]. And Burroughs built the backbone [[switching systems]] for [[Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication]] (SWIFT) which sent its first message in 1977. Unisys is still the provider to SWIFT today.\n* Burroughs produced the [[Burroughs B2500|B2500]] or \"medium systems\" computers aimed primarily at the business world. The machines were designed to execute [[COBOL]] efficiently. This included a BCD ([[Binary Coded Decimal]]) based arithmetic unit, storing and addressing the main memory using [[base 10]] numbering instead of [[Binary numeral system|binary]]. The designation for these systems was Burroughs B2500 through B49xx, followed by Unisys V-Series V340 through V560.\n* Burroughs produced the [[Burroughs B1700|B1700]] or \"small systems\" computers that were designed to be [[microprogram]]med, with each process potentially getting its own [[virtual machine]] designed to be the best match to the [[programming language]] chosen for the program being run.\n* The smallest general-purpose computers were the B700 \"microprocessors\" which were used both as stand-alone systems and as special-purpose data-communications or disk-subsystem controllers.\n* Burroughs also manufactured an extensive range of [[accounting machine]]s including both stand-alone systems such as the [[Burroughs Sensimatic|Sensimatic]], L500 and B80, and dedicated terminals including the TC500 and specialised check processing equipment.<ref>[http://www.picklesnet.com/burroughs/descriptions/b80.htm Burroughs B80 Family]</ref>\n* In 1982, Burroughs began producing [[personal computer]]s, the B20 and B25 lines with the [[Intel 8086]]/[[Intel 8088|8088]] family of 16-bit chips as the processor.<ref>[http://www.oocities.org/siliconvalley/pines/4011/misc-doc/Intro.htm \"B25 FAMILY OF UNIVERSAL WORKSTATIONS INTRODUCTION\"], 1987</ref> These ran the [[Convergent Technologies Operating System|BTOS]] operating system, which Burroughs licensed from [[Convergent Technologies (Unisys)|Convergent Technologies]]. These machines implemented an early [[Local Area Network]] to share a [[hard disk]] between [[workgroup (computer networking)|workgroup]] users. These microcomputers were later manufactured in [[Kunming]], [[China]] for use in China under agreement with Burroughs.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/03/business/china-deal-for-burroughs.html \"China Deal For Burroughs\"], ''The New York Times'', [[Associated Press|AP]] story, January 3, 1985</ref>\n* Burroughs collaborated with [[University of Illinois]] on a multiprocessor architecture developing the [[ILLIAC IV]] computer in the early 1960s. The ILLIAC had up to 128 parallel processors while the B6700 & B7700 only accommodated a total of 7 CPUs and/or IO units (the 8th unit was the memory tester).\n* Burroughs made military computers, such as the D825 (the \"D\" prefix signifying it was for defense industrial use), in its Great Valley Laboratory in [[Paoli, Pennsylvania]].<ref>[http://www.smecc.org/burroughs_buic_-__an_gsa-51__sage_backup.htm \"Burroughs BUIC - AN/GSA-51 SAGE Backup\"], archived at SMECC</ref><ref>{{Cite book | last1 = Anderson | first1 = J.

Burroughs designated it the B8300 after [[Trans World Airlines]] (TWA) ordered one in September 1965. A system with three instruction processors was installed at TWA's reservations center in [[Rockleigh, New Jersey]] in 1968. The system, which was called George, with an application programmed in [[JOVIAL]], was intended to support some 4000 terminals, but the system experienced repeated crashes due to a filing system disk allocation error when operating under a large load. A fourth processor was added but did nothing to resolve the problem. The problem was resolved in late 1970 and the system became stable. Unfortunately, the decision to cancel the project was being made at the very time that the problem was resolved. TWA cancelled the project and acquired one [[IBM System/360]] Model 75, two IBM System/360 model 65s, and IBM's [[Programmed Airline Reservations System|PARS]] software for its reservations system. TWA sued Burroughs for non-fulfillment of the contract, but Burroughs counter-sued, stating that the basic system did work and that the problems were in TWA's applications software. The two companies reached an out-of-court settlement.<ref name=\"B3G\">{{cite journal|last=Gray|first=George|url=http://wiki.cc.gatech.edu/folklore/index.php/Burroughs_Third-Generation_Computers|title=Burroughs Third-Generation Computers|journal=Unisys History Newsletter|volume=3|issue=5|date=October 1999|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171002194413/https://wiki.cc.gatech.edu/folklore/index.php/Main_Page|archive-date=October 2, 2017}}</ref>\n*  Burroughs developed a half-size version of the D825 called the D82, cutting the word size from 48 to 24 bits and simplifying the computer's instruction set. The D82 could have up to 32,768 words of core memory and continued the use of separate instruction and i/o processors. Burroughs sold a D82 to [[Air Canada]] to handle reservations for trips originating in [[Montreal]] and [[Quebec]]. This design was further refined and made much more compact as the [[Pershing_missile_bibliography#Burroughs|D84]] machine which was completed in 1965. A D84 processor/memory unit with 4096 words of memory occupied just 1.4 cubic feet. This system was used successfully in two military projects: field test systems used to check the electronics of the Air Force [[General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark]] fighter plane and systems used to control the countdown and launch of the Army's [[Pershing 1]] [[Pershing 1a]] missile systems.<ref name=\"B3G\"/><ref>[http://umedia.lib.umn.edu/node/30883 \"Title: Trade show exhibition featuring the D84; Date 1965\"], University of Minnesota archives</ref>\n\n==Merger==\nIn September 1986, Burroughs Corporation merged with [[Sperry Corporation]] to form [[Unisys]]. For a time, the combined company retained the Burroughs processors as the A- and V-systems lines.

Traditionally, the term brick referred to a unit composed of [[clay]], but it is now used to denote any rectangular units laid in mortar. A brick can be composed of clay-bearing soil, sand, and lime, or [[concrete]] materials. Bricks are produced in numerous classes, types, materials, and sizes which vary with region and time period, and are produced in bulk quantities. Two basic categories of bricks are ''fired'' and ''non-fired'' bricks.\n\n[[Concrete masonry unit|Block]] is a similar term referring to a rectangular building unit composed of similar materials, but is usually larger than a brick. Lightweight bricks (also called lightweight blocks) are made from [[expanded clay aggregate]].\n\nFired bricks are one of the longest-lasting and strongest [[building material]]s, sometimes referred to as artificial stone, and have been used since circa 4000 BC. Air-dried bricks, also known as [[mudbrick]]s, have a history older than fired bricks, and have an additional ingredient of a mechanical binder such as straw.\n\nBricks are laid in ''courses'' and numerous patterns known as ''bonds'', collectively known as [[brickwork]], and may be laid in various kinds of [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] to hold the bricks together to make a durable structure.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Historic brick street in Natchitoches, LA IMG 1943.JPG|thumb|left|Bricked Front Street along the [[Cane River]] in historic [[Natchitoches, Louisiana|Natchitoches]], [[Louisiana]]]]\n=== Middle East and South Asia ===\n[[File:Ishtika House Construction - Saradas.jpg|thumb|left|House construction using bricks in Kerala, India]]\n[[File:Shebli2.jpg|thumb|upright|The brickwork of [[Shebeli Tower]] in [[Iran]] displays 12th-century craftsmanship]]\n[[File:JetawanaStupa1.JPG|thumb|upright|left|The ancient [[Jetavanaramaya]] [[stupa]] in [[Anuradhapura]], [[Sri Lanka]] is one of the largest brick structures in the world.]]\nThe earliest bricks were ''dried brick'', meaning that they were formed from clay-bearing earth or mud and dried (usually in the sun) until they were strong enough for use.

An independent style of brick architecture, known as [[brick Gothic]] (similar to [[Gothic architecture]]) flourished in places that lacked indigenous sources of rocks. Examples of this architectural style can be found in modern-day [[Denmark]], [[Germany]], [[Poland]], and [[Russia]].\n\nThis style evolved into [[List of Brick Renaissance buildings|Brick Renaissance]] as the stylistic changes associated with the [[Italian Renaissance]] spread to northern Europe, leading to the adoption of [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] elements into brick building. A clear distinction between the two styles only developed at the transition to [[Baroque architecture]]. In [[L\u00fcbeck]], for example, Brick Renaissance is clearly recognisable in buildings equipped with terracotta reliefs by the artist Statius von D\u00fcren, who was also active at [[Schwerin]] ([[Schwerin Castle]]) and [[Wismar]] (F\u00fcrstenhof).\n\nLong-distance [[bulk transport]] of bricks and other construction equipment remained prohibitively expensive until the development of modern transportation infrastructure, with the construction of [[canal]], [[road]]s, and [[railway]]s.\n\n=== Industrial era ===\nProduction of bricks increased massively with the onset of the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the rise in factory building in England. For reasons of speed and economy, bricks were increasingly preferred as building material to stone, even in areas where the stone was readily available. It was at this time in [[London]] that bright red brick was chosen for construction to make the buildings more visible in the heavy fog and to help prevent traffic accidents.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ZQl3C5BAHsC|title=London the Biography|author=Peter Ackroyd|page=435|publisher=Random House|year=2001|isbn=978-0-09-942258-7}}</ref>\n\nThe transition from the traditional method of production known as hand-moulding to a mechanised form of mass-production slowly took place during the first half of the nineteenth century. Possibly the first successful brick-making machine was [[patent]]ed by Henry Clayton, employed at the Atlas Works in [[Middlesex]], England, in 1855, and was capable of producing up to 25,000 bricks daily with minimal supervision.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US13123|title=Henry Clayton|accessdate=17 December 2012}}</ref> His mechanical apparatus soon achieved widespread attention after it was adopted for use by the [[South Eastern Railway, UK|South Eastern Railway Company]] for brick-making at their factory near [[Folkestone]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=S54AAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&pg=GBS.PA361|title=The Mechanics Magazine and Journal of Engineering, Agricultural Machinery, Manufactures and Shipbuilding|year=1859|page=361}}</ref> The [[Bradley & Craven Ltd]] \u2018Stiff-Plastic Brickmaking Machine\u2019 was patented in 1853, apparently predating Clayton.

The use of brick for [[skyscraper]] construction severely limited the size of the building \u2013 the [[Monadnock Building]], built in 1896 in Chicago, required exceptionally thick walls to maintain the structural integrity of its 17 storeys.\n\nFollowing pioneering work in the 1950s at the [[ETH Zurich|Swiss Federal Institute of Technology]] and the [[Building Research Establishment]] in [[Watford]], UK, the use of improved masonry for the construction of tall structures up to 18 storeys high was made viable. However, the use of brick has largely remained restricted to small to medium-sized buildings, as steel and concrete remain superior materials for high-rise construction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dehoopsteenwerwe.co.za/information03.html|title=The History of Bricks|publisher=De Hoop:Steenwerve Brickfields}}</ref>\n\n== Types ==\n[[File:2008 BeaconHill Boston 2302897829.jpg|thumb|This wall in [[Beacon Hill, Boston]] shows different types of brickwork and stone foundations]]\nThere are thousands of types of bricks that are named for their use, size, forming method, origin, quality, texture, and/or materials.\n\nCategorized by manufacture method:\n* Extruded \u2013 made by being forced through an opening in a steel die, with a very consistent size and shape.\n** Wire-cut \u2013 cut to size after extrusion with a tensioned wire which may leave drag marks\n* Moulded \u2013 shaped in moulds rather than being extruded\n** Machine-moulded - clay is forced into moulds using pressure\n** Handmade - clay is forced into moulds by a person\n* Dry-pressed - similar to soft mud method, but starts with a much thicker clay mix and is compressed with great force.\n\nCategorized by use:\n* Common or building \u2013 A brick not intended to be visible, used for internal structure\n* Face \u2013 A brick used on exterior surfaces to present a clean appearance\n* Hollow \u2013 not solid, the holes are less than 25% of the brick volume\n** Perforated \u2013 holes greater than 25% of the brick volume\n* Keyed \u2013 indentations in at least one face and end to be used with rendering and plastering\n* Paving \u2013 brick intended to be in ground contact as a walkway or roadway\n* Thin \u2013 brick with normal height and length but thin width to be used as a veneer\n\nSpecialized use bricks:\n* Chemically resistant \u2013 bricks made with resistance to chemicals\n** [[Acid brick]] \u2013 acid resistant bricks\n* [[Engineering brick|Engineering]] \u2013 a type of hard, dense, brick used where strength, low water porosity or acid (flue gas) resistance are needed.

The shaped clay is then fired (\"burned\") at 900\u20131000&nbsp;\u00b0C to achieve strength.\n* Dry-pressed bricks \u2013 The dry-press method is similar to the soft-mud moulded method, but starts with a much thicker clay mix, so it forms more accurate, sharper-edged bricks. The greater force in pressing and the longer burn make this method more expensive.\n* Extruded bricks \u2013 For extruded bricks the clay is mixed with 10\u201315% [[water]] (stiff extrusion) or 20\u201325% water (soft extrusion) in a [[pugmill]]. This mixture is forced through a [[Die (manufacturing)|die]] to create a long cable of material of the desired width and depth. This mass is then cut into bricks of the desired length by a wall of wires. Most structural bricks are made by this method as it produces hard, dense bricks, and suitable dies can produce perforations as well. The introduction of such holes reduces the volume of clay needed, and hence the cost. Hollow bricks are lighter and easier to handle, and have different thermal properties from solid bricks. The cut bricks are hardened by drying for 20 to 40 hours at 50 to 150&nbsp;\u00b0C before being fired. The heat for drying is often waste heat from the kiln.\n\n==== Kilns ====\n[[File:Raw Indian brick.jpg|thumb|Raw (green) Indian brick]]\n[[File:Xhosa brickmaker at kiln near Ngcobo.jpg|thumb|left|[[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] brickmaker at kiln near [[Ngcobo]] in 2007]]\n[[File:A brickmaker - Tashrih al-aqvam (1825), f.253v - BL Add. 27255.jpg|thumb|A brickmaker in India \u2013 ''Tashrih al-aqvam'' (1825)]]\nIn many modern [[brickworks]], bricks are usually fired in a continuously fired tunnel kiln, in which the bricks are fired as they move slowly through the kiln on [[conveyors]], rails, or kiln cars, which achieves a more consistent brick product. The bricks often have [[Lime (material)|lime]], ash, and organic matter added, which accelerates the burning process.\n\nThe other major kiln type is the Bull's Trench Kiln (BTK), based on a design developed by British engineer W. Bull in the late 19th century.\n\nAn oval or circular trench is dug, 6\u20139 metres wide, 2-2.5 metres deep, and 100\u2013150 metres in circumference. A tall exhaust chimney is constructed in the centre. Half or more of the trench is filled with \"green\" (unfired) bricks which are stacked in an open lattice pattern to allow airflow. The lattice is capped with a roofing layer of finished brick.\n\nIn operation, new green bricks, along with roofing bricks, are stacked at one end of the brick pile; cooled finished bricks are removed from the other end for transport to their destinations. In the middle, the brick workers create a firing zone by dropping fuel (coal, wood, oil, debris, and so on) through access holes in the roof above the trench.\n\nThe advantage of the BTK design is a much greater energy efficiency compared with [[clamp kiln|clamp]] or [[scove kiln]]s. Sheet metal or boards are used to route the airflow through the brick lattice so that fresh air flows first through the recently burned bricks, heating the air, then through the active burning zone. The air continues through the green brick zone (pre-heating and drying the bricks), and finally out the chimney, where the rising gases create suction that pulls air through the system. The reuse of heated air yields savings in fuel cost.\n\nAs with the rail process, the BTK process is continuous. A half-dozen labourers working around the clock can fire approximately 15,000\u201325,000 bricks a day. Unlike the rail process, in the BTK process the bricks do not move. Instead, the locations at which the bricks are loaded, fired, and unloaded gradually rotate through the trench.<ref>Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency, [http://www.environment.gov.pk/EA-GLines/I1B-Brick%20Kilns.pdf Brick Kiln Units (PDF file)]</ref>\n\n==== Influences on colour ====\n[[File:London stock brick (bridge).jpg|thumb|Yellow London Stocks at [[London Waterloo station|Waterloo station]]]]\nThe fired colour of tired clay bricks is influenced by the chemical and mineral content of the raw materials, the firing temperature, and the atmosphere in the kiln. For example, pink bricks are the result of a high iron content, white or yellow bricks have a higher lime content. Most bricks burn to various red hues; as the temperature is increased the colour moves through dark red, purple, and then to brown or grey at around {{convert|1300|C|0|abbr=on}}. The names of bricks may reflect their origin and colour, such as [[London stock brick]] and Cambridgeshire White. ''Brick tinting'' may be performed to change the colour of bricks to blend-in areas of brickwork with the surrounding masonry.\n\nAn impervious and ornamental surface may be laid on brick either by [[salt glaze pottery|salt glazing]], in which salt is added during the burning process, or by the use of a [[Slip (ceramics)|slip]], which is a glaze material into which the bricks are dipped. Subsequent reheating in the kiln fuses the slip into a glazed surface integral with the brick base.\n\n=== Chemically set bricks ===\nChemically set bricks are not fired but may have the curing process accelerated by the application of heat and pressure in an autoclave.\n\n==== Calcium-silicate bricks ====\n[[File:Mexitegel.jpg|thumb|left|Swedish Mexitegel is a sand-lime or lime-cement brick.]]\n<!--\n    NB: This is NOT related to the chemical compound \"calcium silicate\"\n    These are bricks made from calcium compounds (lime) and silicate compounds (sand)\n-->\nCalcium-silicate bricks are also called sandlime or flintlime bricks, depending on their ingredients. Rather than being made with clay they are made with [[Lime (mineral)|lime]] binding the silicate material. The raw materials for calcium-silicate bricks include lime mixed in a proportion of about 1 to 10 with sand, [[quartz]], crushed [[flint]], or crushed siliceous rock together with mineral [[colourant]]s. The materials are mixed and left until the lime is completely hydrated; the mixture is then pressed into moulds and cured in an [[autoclave]] for three to fourteen hours to speed the chemical hardening.<ref name=\"EMS\">McArthur, Hugh, and Duncan Spalding. ''Engineering materials science: properties, uses, degradation and remediation''. Chichester, U.K.: Horwood Pub., 2004. 194. Print.</ref> The finished bricks are very accurate and uniform, although the sharp [[arris]]es need careful handling to avoid damage to brick and bricklayer. The bricks can be made in a variety of colours; white, black, buff, and grey-blues are common, and pastel shades can be achieved. This type of brick is common in Sweden, especially in houses built or renovated in the 1970s. In India these are known as [[fly ash brick]]s, manufactured using the FaL-G (fly ash, lime, and gypsum) process. Calcium-silicate bricks are also manufactured in Canada and the United States, and meet the criteria set forth in ASTM C73 \u2013 10 Standard Specification for Calcium Silicate Brick (Sand-Lime Brick).\n\n==== Concrete bricks ====\n{{Main|Concrete masonry unit}}\n[[File:Brickworks in Hainan - cement vessel, maker, stacker 01.jpg|thumb|A concrete brick-making assembly line in [[Guilinyang]] Town, Hainan, China. This operation produces a pallet containing 42 bricks, approximately every 30 seconds.]]\n\nBricks formed from [[concrete]] are usually termed as blocks, and are typically pale grey. They are made from a dry, small aggregate concrete which is formed in steel moulds by vibration and compaction in either an \"egglayer\" or static machine. The finished blocks are cured, rather than fired, using low-pressure steam. Concrete blocks are manufactured in a much wider range of shapes and sizes than clay bricks and are also available with a wider range of face treatments \u2013 a number of which simulate the appearance of clay bricks.\n\nConcrete bricks are available in many colours and as an engineering brick made with sulfate-resisting Portland cement or equivalent. When made with adequate amount of cement they are suitable for harsh environments such as wet conditions and retaining walls. They are made to standards BS 6073, EN 771-3 or ASTM C55. Concrete bricks contract or shrink so they need movement joints every 5 to 6 metres, but are similar to other bricks of similar density in thermal and sound resistance and fire resistance.<ref name=\"EMS\" />\n\n=== Compressed earth blocks ===\n{{Main|Compressed earth block}}\n[[Compressed earth block]]s are made mostly from slightly moistened local soils compressed with a mechanical hydraulic press or manual lever press. A small amount of a cement binder may be added, resulting in a ''stabilised compressed earth block''.\n\n== Optimal dimensions, characteristics, and strength ==\n[[File:comparison_house_brick_size.svg|thumb|left|300px|Comparison of typical brick sizes of assorted countries with isometric projections with dimensions in mm]]\n[[File:Brick pile.jpg|thumb|Loose bricks]]\nFor efficient handling and laying, bricks must be small enough and light enough to be picked up by the bricklayer using one hand (leaving the other hand free for the trowel). Bricks are usually laid flat, and as a result, the effective limit on the width of a brick is set by the distance which can conveniently be spanned between the thumb and fingers of one hand, normally about four inches (about 100&nbsp;mm). In most cases, the length of a brick is twice its width plus the width of a mortar joint, about eight inches (about 200&nbsp;mm) or slightly more. This allows bricks to be laid ''[[Brickwork|bonded]]'' in a structure which increases stability and strength (for an example, see the illustration of bricks laid in ''English bond'', at the head of this article). The wall is built using alternating courses of ''stretchers'', bricks laid longways, and ''headers'', bricks laid crossways. The headers tie the wall together over its width. In fact, this wall is built in a variation of ''English bond'' called ''English cross bond'' where the successive layers of stretchers are displaced horizontally from each other by half a brick length. In true ''English bond'', the perpendicular lines of the stretcher courses are in line with each other.\n\nA bigger brick makes for a thicker (and thus more insulating) wall. Historically, this meant that bigger bricks were necessary in colder climates (see for instance the slightly larger size of the Russian brick in table below), while a smaller brick was adequate, and more economical, in warmer regions. A notable illustration of this correlation is the [[Green Gate]] in Gdansk; built in 1571 of imported [[Dutch brick]], too small for the colder climate of Gdansk, it was notorious for being a chilly and drafty residence. Nowadays this is no longer an issue, as modern walls typically incorporate specialised insulation materials.\n\nThe correct brick for a job can be selected from a choice of colour, surface texture, density, weight, absorption, and pore structure, thermal characteristics, thermal and moisture movement, and fire resistance.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"clear:left\"\n|+Face brick (\"house brick\") sizes, (alphabetical order)\n!Standard !!Imperial !!Metric\n|-\n|{{AUS}} || 9 \u00d7 4\u2153 \u00d7 3 [[Inch|in]] || 230 \u00d7 110 \u00d7 76&nbsp;[[Millimetre|mm]]\n|-\n|{{DEN}} || 9 \u00d7 4\u00bc \u00d7 2\u00bc in|| 228 \u00d7 108 \u00d7 54&nbsp;mm\n|-\n|{{GER}} || 9 \u00d7 4\u00bc \u00d7 2\u00be in|| 240 \u00d7 115 \u00d7 71&nbsp;mm\n|-\n|{{IND}} || 9 \u00d7 4\u00bc \u00d7 2\u00be in|| 228 \u00d7 107 \u00d7 69&nbsp;mm\n|-\n|{{ROM}} || 9 \u00d7 4\u00bc \u00d7 2\u00bd in|| 240 \u00d7 115 \u00d7 63&nbsp;mm\n|-\n|{{RUS}} || 10 \u00d7 4\u00be \u00d7 2\u00bd in || 250 \u00d7 120 \u00d7 65&nbsp;mm\n|-\n|{{RSA}} || 8\u00be \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 in|| 222 \u00d7 106 \u00d7 73&nbsp;mm\n|-\n|{{SWE}} || 10 \u00d7 4\u00be \u00d7 2\u00bd in || 250 \u00d7 120 \u00d7 62&nbsp;mm\n|-\n|{{UK}} || 8\u00bd \u00d7 4 \u00d7 2\u00bd in|| 215 \u00d7 102.5 \u00d7 65&nbsp;mm\n|-\n|{{USA}} || 7\u215d \u00d7 3\u215d \u00d7 2\u00bc in|| 194 \u00d7 92 \u00d7 57&nbsp;mm\n|}\n\nIn England, the length and width of the common brick has remained fairly constant over the centuries (but see [[brick tax]]), but the depth has varied from about two inches (about 51&nbsp;mm) or smaller in earlier times to about two and a half inches (about 64&nbsp;mm) more recently. In the [[United Kingdom]], the usual size of a modern brick is 215 \u00d7 102.5 \u00d7 65&nbsp;mm (about {{frac|8|5|8}} \u00d7 {{frac|4|1|8}} \u00d7 {{frac|2|5|8}}&nbsp;inches), which, with a nominal 10&nbsp;mm ({{frac|3|8}}&nbsp;inch) mortar joint, forms a ''[[unit size]]'' of 225 \u00d7 112.5 \u00d7 75&nbsp;mm (9 \u00d7 {{frac|4|1|2}} \u00d7 3&nbsp;inches), for a ratio of 6:3:2.\n\nIn the United States, modern standard bricks are specified for various uses;<ref>[http://www.gobrick.com/portals/25/docs/technical%20notes/tn9a.pdf].

Technical Note 10, Dimensioning and Estimating Brick Masonry (pdf file) Retrieved 8 November 2016.</ref>\n\nSome brickmakers create innovative sizes and shapes for bricks used for plastering (and therefore not visible on the inside of the building) where their inherent mechanical properties are more important than their visual ones.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20081206161820/http://www.crammix.co.za/maxilite.htm Crammix ''Maxilite'']. crammix.co.za</ref> These bricks are usually slightly larger, but not as large as blocks and offer the following advantages:\n* A slightly larger brick requires less mortar and handling (fewer bricks), which reduces cost\n* Their ribbed exterior aids plastering\n* More complex interior cavities allow improved insulation, while maintaining strength.\n\nBlocks have a much greater range of sizes. Standard co-ordinating sizes in length and height (in mm) include 400\u00d7200, 450\u00d7150, 450\u00d7200, 450\u00d7225, 450\u00d7300, 600\u00d7150, 600\u00d7200, and 600\u00d7225; depths (work size, mm) include 60, 75, 90, 100, 115, 140, 150, 190, 200, 225, and 250. They are usable across this range as they are lighter than clay bricks. The density of solid clay bricks is around 2000&nbsp;kg/m\u00b3: this is reduced by frogging, hollow bricks, and so on, but aerated autoclaved concrete, even as a solid brick, can have densities in the range of 450\u2013850&nbsp;kg/m\u00b3.\n\nBricks may also be classified as ''solid'' (less than 25% perforations by volume, although the brick may be \"frogged,\" having indentations on one of the longer faces), ''perforated'' (containing a pattern of small holes through the brick, removing no more than 25% of the volume), ''cellular'' (containing a pattern of holes removing more than 20% of the volume, but closed on one face), or ''hollow'' (containing a pattern of large holes removing more than 25% of the brick's volume). Blocks may be solid, cellular or hollow\n\nThe term \"frog\" can refer to the indentation or the implement used to make it. Modern brickmakers usually use plastic frogs but in the past they were made of wood.\n\n[[File:Vault of Roman Bath in Bath - England.jpg|thumb|upright|Brick arch from a vault in [[Aquae Sulis|Roman Bath]] \u2013 England]]\n[[File:Dixie Highway Maitland.jpg|thumb|left|A brick section of the old [[Dixie Highway]], United States]]\n\nThe compressive strength of bricks produced in the United States ranges from about 1000&nbsp;lbf/in\u00b2 to 15,000&nbsp;lbf/in\u00b2 (7 to 105 [[MPa]] or N/mm\u00b2 ), varying according to the use to which the brick are to be put. In England clay bricks can have strengths of up to 100 [[MPa]], although a common house brick is likely to show a range of 20\u201340 [[MPa]].\n\n== Use ==\nIn the United States, bricks have been used for both buildings and pavements. Examples of brick use in buildings can be seen in colonial era buildings and other notable structures around the country.  Bricks have been used in pavements especially during the late 19th century and early 20th century. The introduction of asphalt and concrete reduced the use of brick pavements, but it is  used as a method of [[traffic calming]] or as a decorative surface in [[pedestrianized zone|pedestrian precincts]]. For example, in the early 1900s, most of the streets in the city of [[Grand Rapids]], [[Michigan]], were paved with bricks. Today, there are only about 20 blocks of brick-paved streets remaining (totalling less than 0.5 percent of all the streets in the city limits).<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090704104107/http://ostpxweb.dot.gov/preserveamerica/stories/michigan/index.cfm Michigan | Success Stories | Preserve America | Office of the Secretary of Transportation | U.S. Department of Transportation].</ref> Much like in Grand Rapids, municipalities across the United States began replacing brick streets with inexpensive [[asphalt concrete]] by the mid-20th century.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2003-07-31-brick-roads_x.htm|title=Bricks come back to city streets|last=Schwartz|first=Emma|date=2003-07-31|work=[[USA Today]]|access-date=2017-05-04|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}</ref>\n\nBricks in the [[metallurgy]] and [[glass]] industries are often used for lining [[furnace]]s, in particular [[refractory]] bricks such as [[silica]], [[Periclase|magnesia]], [[Grog (clay)|chamotte]] and neutral ([[chromomagnesite]]) [[fire brick|refractory bricks]]. This type of brick must have good [[thermal shock]] resistance, refractoriness under load, high melting point, and satisfactory [[porosity]]. There is a large refractory [[brick industry]], especially in the United Kingdom, Japan, the United States, Belgium and the Netherlands.\n\nIn Northwest Europe, bricks have been used in construction for centuries. Until recently, almost all houses were built almost entirely from bricks. Although many houses are now built using a mixture of [[concrete block]]s and other materials, many houses are skinned with a layer of bricks on the outside for aesthetic appeal.\n\n[[Engineering brick]]s are used where strength, low water porosity or acid (flue gas) resistance are needed.\n\nIn the UK a [[red brick university]] is one founded in the late 19th or early 20th century. The term is used to refer to such institutions collectively to distinguish them from the older [[Oxbridge]] institutions, and refers to the use of bricks, as opposed to stone, in their buildings.\n\nColombian architect [[Rogelio Salmona]] was noted for his extensive use of red bricks in his buildings and for using natural shapes like spirals, radial geometry and curves in his designs.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/06/arts/06salmona.html?_r=1&ref=obituaries&oref=slogin | work=The New York Times | first=Simon | last=Romero | title=Rogelio Salmona, Colombian Architect Who Transformed Cities, Is Dead at 78 | date=6 October 2007}}</ref> Most buildings in [[Colombia]] are made of brick, given the abundance of clay in equatorial countries like this one.\n\n== Limitations ==\nStarting in the 20th century, the use of brickwork declined in some areas due to concerns with earthquakes. Earthquakes such as the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|San Francisco earthquake of 1906]] and the [[1933 Long Beach earthquake]] revealed the weaknesses of unreinforced brick masonry in earthquake-prone areas. During seismic events, the mortar cracks and crumbles, and the bricks are no longer held together. Brick masonry with steel reinforcement, which helps hold the masonry together during earthquakes, was used to replace many of the unreinforced masonry buildings. Retrofitting older unreinforced masonry structures has been mandated in many jurisdictions.\n{{wide image|San Francisco earthquake.jpg|1600px|A panorama after the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]].|100%|center}}\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:Pergamonmuseum Babylon Ischtar-Tor.jpg|[[Ishtar Gate]] of [[Babylon]] in the [[Pergamon Museum]], [[Berlin]], [[Germany]]\nFile:Opus reticulatum 2.JPG|Roman [[opus reticulatum]] on Hadrian's Villa in [[Tivoli, Italy]] (2nd century)\nFile:Munich Frauenkirche.jpg|[[Frauenkirche (Munich)|Frauenkirche]], [[Munich]], [[Germany]], erected 1468\u20131488, looking up at the towers\nFile:Torun sw Jakub szczyt zach.JPG|Eastern gable of church of St. James in [[Toru\u0144]] (14th century)\nFile:Radzyn Chelm zamek zendrowka.jpg|Decorative pattern made of strongly fired bricks in [[Radzy\u0144 Che\u0142mi\u0144ski|Radzy\u0144]] Castle (14th century)\nFile:Teruel - Torre de San Mart\u00edn.jpg|[[Mud\u00e9jar]] brick church tower in [[Teruel]], [[Spain]], (14th century)\nFile:thornbury.twochimneys.arp.750pix.jpg|Brick sculpting on [[Thornbury Castle]], Thornbury, near [[Bristol]], England.

He is considered one of the most important composers of the 20th century; he and [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]] are regarded as Hungary's greatest composers {{harv|Gillies |2001}}. Through his collection and analytical study of [[folk music]], he was one of the founders of comparative musicology, which later became [[ethnomusicology]]. \n\n==Biography==\n===Childhood and early years (1881\u201398)===\nBart\u00f3k was born in the [[Banat]]ian town of Nagyszentmikl\u00f3s in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], [[Austria-Hungary]] (since 1920 [[S\u00e2nnicolau Mare]], Romania) on 25 March 1881. \n\nBart\u00f3k had a diverse ancestry. On his father's side, the Bart\u00f3k family was a Hungarian lower noble family, originating from [[Borsodszir\u00e1k]], [[Borsod County|Borsod]] {{harv|M\u00f3ser|2006a|loc=44}}. \nAlthough his paternal grandmother was from a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] Serbian <!-- is this correct, Catholic Serbian family\" -->family, Bart\u00f3k's father, also named B\u00e9la, considered himself to be an ethnic-born Hungarian. \nB\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k's mother, Paula (n\u00e9e Voit), an ethnic German, spoke [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] fluently {{harv|Hooker|2001|loc=16}}. She was a native of Tur\u010diansky Sv\u00e4t\u00fd Martin (now [[Martin, Slovakia]]).{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} Paula also had Magyar (Ter\u00e9z Fegyveres) and Slavic ([[Polereczky]]: Magyarized Slavic) ancestors.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nB\u00e9la displayed notable musical talent very early in life: according to his mother, he could distinguish between different dance rhythms that she played on the piano before he learned to speak in complete sentences {{harv|Gillies|1990|loc=6}}. By the age of four he was able to play 40 pieces on the piano and his mother began formally teaching him the next year.\n\nB\u00e9la was a small and sickly child and suffered from severe [[eczema]] until the age of five {{harv|Gillies|1990|loc=5}}. In 1888, when he was seven, his father (the director of an agricultural school) died suddenly. His mother then took him and his sister, Erzs\u00e9bet, to live in [[Nagysz\u0151l\u0151s]] (today [[Vinogradiv]], Ukraine) and then to [[Pozsony]] (present-day [[Bratislava]], Slovakia).{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nHe gave his first public recital aged 11 in Nagysz\u0151l\u0151s, to a warm critical reception {{harv|Griffiths|1988|loc={{Page needed|date=April 2016}}}}. Among the pieces he played was his own first composition, written two years previously: a short piece called \"The Course of the Danube\" {{harv|de Toth|1999}}. Shortly thereafter L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Erkel accepted him as a pupil {{harv|Stevens|1964|loc=8}}.\n\n===Early musical career (1899\u20131908)===\n[[File:Bartok tablo.jpg|thumb|left|Bart\u00f3k's signature on his high-school-graduation photograph, dated 9 September 1899]]\n\nFrom 1899 to 1903, Bart\u00f3k studied piano under [[Istv\u00e1n Thom\u00e1n]], a former student of [[Franz Liszt]], and composition under [[J\u00e1nos Koessler]] at the [[Royal Academy of Music in Budapest]] {{harv|Anon.|2018}}. There he met [[Zolt\u00e1n Kod\u00e1ly]], who made a strong impression on him and became a lifelong friend and colleague {{harv|Rockwell|1982}}. In 1903, Bart\u00f3k wrote his first major orchestral work, Kossuth, a [[symphonic poem]] which honored [[Lajos Kossuth]], hero of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848]] {{harv|Stevens|2018}}.\n\nThe music of [[Richard Strauss]], whom he met in 1902 at the [[Budapest]] premiere of ''[[Also sprach Zarathustra (Strauss)|Also sprach Zarathustra]]'', strongly influenced his early work {{harv|Wilhelm|1989|loc=73}}. When visiting a holiday resort in the summer of 1904, Bart\u00f3k overheard a young nanny, Lidi D\u00f3sa from [[Kib\u00e9d]] in Transylvania, sing folk songs to the children in her care. This sparked his lifelong dedication to folk music {{harv|Kory|2007}}.\n\nFrom 1907, he also began to be influenced by the French composer [[Claude Debussy]], whose compositions Kod\u00e1ly had brought back from Paris. Bart\u00f3k's large-scale orchestral works were still in the style of [[Johannes Brahms]] and Richard Strauss, but he wrote a number of small piano pieces which showed his growing interest in folk music. The first piece to show clear signs of this new interest is the [[String Quartet No. 1 (Bart\u00f3k)|String Quartet No. 1]] in A minor (1908), which contains folk-like elements {{harv|Rodda|1990\u20132018}}.\n\nIn 1907, Bart\u00f3k began teaching as a piano professor at the Royal Academy {{harv|Anon.|1945}}. This position freed him from touring Europe as a pianist and enabled him to work in Hungary. Among his notable students were [[Fritz Reiner]], [[Sir Georg Solti]], [[Gy\u00f6rgy S\u00e1ndor]], [[Ern\u0151 Balogh]], and [[Lili Kraus]]. After Bart\u00f3k moved to the United States, he taught [[Jack Beeson]] and [[Violet Archer]].\n\nIn 1908, he and Kod\u00e1ly traveled into the countryside to collect and research old [[Hungarian people|Magyar]] folk melodies. Their growing interest in folk music coincided with a contemporary social interest in traditional national culture. They made some surprising discoveries. Magyar folk music had previously been categorised as [[Romani people|Gypsy]] music. The classic example is Franz Liszt's famous ''[[Hungarian Rhapsodies]]'' for piano, which he based on popular art songs performed by [[Romani people|Romani]] bands of the time. In contrast, Bart\u00f3k and Kod\u00e1ly discovered that the old Magyar folk melodies were based on [[pentatonic]] scales, similar to those in Asian folk traditions, such as those of Central Asia, [[Anatolia]] and [[Siberia]].\n\nBart\u00f3k and Kod\u00e1ly quickly set about incorporating elements of such Magyar peasant music into their compositions. They both frequently quoted folk song melodies ''verbatim'' and wrote pieces derived entirely from authentic songs. An example is his two volumes entitled ''For Children'' for solo piano, containing 80 folk tunes to which he wrote accompaniment. Bart\u00f3k's style in his art music compositions was a synthesis of folk music, classicism, and modernism. His melodic and harmonic sense was profoundly influenced by the folk music of Hungary, Romania, and other nations. He was especially fond of the asymmetrical dance rhythms and pungent harmonies found in [[Bulgarian music]]. Most of his early compositions offer a blend of nationalist and late Romanticism elements.\n\n===Middle years and career (1909\u201339)===\n\n====Personal life====\nIn 1909, at the age of 28, Bart\u00f3k married M\u00e1rta Ziegler (1893\u20131967), aged 16. Their son, B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k III, was born on 22 August 1910. After nearly 15 years together, Bart\u00f3k divorced M\u00e1rta in June 1923. Two months after his divorce, he married [[Ditta P\u00e1sztory-Bart\u00f3k|Ditta P\u00e1sztory]] (1903\u20131982), a piano student, ten days after proposing to her. She was aged 19, he 42. Their son, P\u00e9ter, was born in 1924 {{harv|Vetter|2007|loc=22}}.\n\n====Opera====\nIn 1911, Bart\u00f3k wrote what was to be his only opera, ''[[Bluebeard's Castle]]'', dedicated to M\u00e1rta. He entered it for a prize by the Hungarian Fine Arts Commission, but they rejected his work as not fit for the stage {{harv|Chalmers|1995|loc=93}}. In 1917 Bart\u00f3k revised the score for the 1918 premi\u00e8re, and rewrote the ending. Following the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic|1919 revolution]] in which he actively participated, he was pressured by the [[Horthy's Hungary|Horthy regime]] to remove the name of the librettist [[B\u00e9la Bal\u00e1zs]] from the opera {{harv|Chalmers|1995|loc=123}}{{Failed verification|date=September 2016}}<!--Horthy's name does not even occur on p. 123 of Chalmers's book, and Horthy was certainly no Communist!-->, as he was blacklisted and had left the country for Vienna. ''Bluebeard's Castle'' received only one revival, in 1936, before Bart\u00f3k emigrated. For the remainder of his life, although he was passionately devoted to Hungary, its people and its culture, he never felt much loyalty to the government or its official establishments.\n\n====Folk music and composition====\n[[File:Bartok recording folk music.jpg|thumb|B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k using a [[phonograph]] to record folk songs sung by peasants in what is now [[Slovakia]]]]\n\nAfter his disappointment over the Fine Arts Commission competition, Bart\u00f3k wrote little for two or three years, preferring to concentrate on collecting and arranging folk music. He collected first in the [[Carpathian Basin]] (then the [[Kingdom of Hungary in the 18th and 19th century|Kingdom of Hungary]]), where he notated [[Hungarian folk music|Hungarian]], [[Music of Slovakia|Slovak]], [[Music of Romania|Romanian]], and [[Music of Bulgaria|Bulgarian]] folk music. He also collected in [[Moldavia]], [[Wallachia]], and (in 1913) [[Algeria]]. The outbreak of [[World War I]] forced him to stop the expeditions; and he returned to composing, writing the ballet ''[[The Wooden Prince]]'' (1914\u201316) and the [[String Quartet No. 2 (Bart\u00f3k)|String Quartet No. 2]] in (1915\u201317), both influenced by [[Debussy]].\n\nRaised as a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], by his early adulthood Bart\u00f3k had become an atheist. He later became attracted to [[Unitarianism]] and publicly converted to the [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] faith in 1916. Although Bart\u00f3k was not conventionally religious, according to his son B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k III, \"he was a nature lover: he always mentioned the miraculous order of nature with great reverence.\" As an adult, B\u00e9la III later became lay president of the Hungarian Unitarian Church {{harv|Hughes|1999\u20132007}}.\n\nBart\u00f3k wrote another ballet, ''[[The Miraculous Mandarin]]'', influenced by [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Arnold Schoenberg]], as well as [[Richard Strauss]]. A modern story of prostitution, robbery, and murder, it was started in 1918, but not performed until 1926 because of its sexual content. He next wrote his two [[violin sonata]]s (written in 1921 and 1922 respectively), which are harmonically and structurally some of his most complex pieces.\n\nIn 1927\u201328, Bart\u00f3k wrote his [[String Quartet No. 3 (Bart\u00f3k)|Third]] and [[String Quartet No. 4 (Bart\u00f3k)|Fourth String Quartets]], after which his compositions demonstrated his mature style. Notable examples of this period are ''[[Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta]]'' (1936) and [[Divertimento for String Orchestra (Bart\u00f3k)|Divertimento for String Orchestra]] (1939). The [[String Quartet No. 5 (Bart\u00f3k)|Fifth String Quartet]] was composed in 1934, and the [[String Quartet No. 6 (Bart\u00f3k)|Sixth String Quartet]] (his last) in 1939.\n\nIn 1936 he travelled to [[Turkey]] to collect and study folk music. He worked in collaboration with Turkish composer [[Ahmet Adnan Saygun]] mostly around [[Adana]] ({{harvnb|\u00d6zgent\u00fcrk|2008}}; {{harvnb|Sipos|2000}}).\n\n===World War II and last years in America (1940\u201345)===\nIn 1940, as the European political situation worsened after the outbreak of World War II, Bart\u00f3k was increasingly tempted to flee Hungary. He was strongly opposed to the [[Nazis]] and Hungary's siding with Germany. After the Nazis came to power in the early 1930s, Bart\u00f3k refused to give concerts in Germany and broke away from his publisher there. His anti-fascist political views caused him a great deal of trouble with the establishment in Hungary. Having first sent his manuscripts out of the country, Bart\u00f3k reluctantly emigrated to the U.S. with his wife [[Ditta P\u00e1sztory-Bart\u00f3k|Ditta]] in October that year. They settled in New York City after arriving on the night of October 29\u201330, 1940 via a steamer from Lisbon. After joining them in 1942, their younger son, P\u00e9ter Bart\u00f3k, enlisted in the [[United States Navy]] where he served in the Pacific during the remainder of the war and later settled in Florida where he became a recording and sound engineer. His elder son, by his first marriage, B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k III, remained in Hungary and later worked as a railroad official until his retirement in the early 1980s.\n\nAlthough he became an American citizen in 1945, shortly before his death {{harv|Gagn\u00e9|2012|loc=28}}, Bart\u00f3k never felt fully at home in the USA. He initially found it difficult to compose. Although well known in America as a pianist, ethnomusicologist and teacher, he was not well known as a composer. There was little American interest in his music during his final years. He and his wife Ditta gave some concerts, although demand for them was low.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} Bart\u00f3k, who had made some recordings in Hungary, also recorded for [[Columbia Records]] after he came to the US; many of these recordings (some with Bart\u00f3k's own spoken introductions) were later issued on LP and CD {{harvard citations |last=Bart\u00f3k|year=1994 |year2=1995a |year3=1995b |year4=2003 |year5=2007 |year6=2008}}.\n\nSupported by a research fellowship from [[Columbia University]], for several years, Bart\u00f3k and Ditta worked on a large collection of [[Serbian language|Serbian]] and [[Croatian language|Croatian]] folk songs in Columbia's libraries. Bart\u00f3k's economic difficulties during his first years in America were mitigated by publication royalties, teaching and performance tours. While his finances were always precarious, he did not live and die in poverty as was the common myth. He had enough friends and supporters to ensure that there was sufficient money and work available for him to live on. Bart\u00f3k was a proud man and did not easily accept charity. Despite being short on cash at times, he often refused money that his friends offered him out of their own pockets. Although he was not a member of the [[ASCAP]], the society paid for any medical care he needed during his last two years. Bart\u00f3k reluctantly accepted this {{harv|Chalmers|1995|loc=196\u2013203}}.\n\nThe first symptoms of his health problems began late in 1940, when his right shoulder began to show signs of stiffening. In 1942, symptoms increased and he started having bouts of fever, but no underlying disease was diagnosed, in spite of medical examinations. Finally, in April 1944, [[leukemia]] was diagnosed, but by this time, little could be done {{harv|Chalmers|1995|loc=202\u2013207}}.\n\nAs his body slowly failed, Bart\u00f3k found more creative energy, and he produced a final set of masterpieces, partly thanks to the violinist [[Joseph Szigeti]] and the conductor [[Fritz Reiner]] (Reiner had been Bart\u00f3k's friend and champion since his days as Bart\u00f3k's student at the Royal Academy). Bart\u00f3k's last work might well have been the String Quartet No. 6 but for [[Serge Koussevitzky]]'s [[commission (art)|commission]] for the [[Concerto for Orchestra (Bart\u00f3k)|Concerto for Orchestra]]. Koussevitsky's [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]] premi\u00e8red the work in December 1944 to highly positive reviews. The Concerto for Orchestra quickly became Bart\u00f3k's most popular work, although he did not live to see its full impact. In 1944, he was also commissioned by [[Yehudi Menuhin]] to write a [[Sonata for Solo Violin (Bart\u00f3k)|Sonata for Solo Violin]]. In 1945, Bart\u00f3k composed his [[Piano Concerto No. 3 (Bart\u00f3k)|Piano Concerto No. 3]], a graceful and almost neo-classical work, as a surprise 42nd birthday present for Ditta, but he died just over a month before her birthday, with the scoring not quite finished. He had also sketched his [[Viola Concerto (Bart\u00f3k)|Viola Concerto]], but had barely started the scoring at his death, leaving completed only the viola part and sketches of the orchestral part.\n\n[[File:HUF 1000 1983 obverse.jpg|thumb|B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k's portrait on 1,000 [[Hungarian forint]] banknote (printed between 1983 and 1992; no longer in circulation)]]\nB\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k died at age 64 in a hospital in New York City from complications of [[leukemia]] (specifically, of secondary [[polycythemia]]) on 26 September 1945. His funeral was attended by only ten people. Among them were his wife Ditta, their son P\u00e9ter, and his pianist friend [[Gy\u00f6rgy S\u00e1ndor]] {{harv|Anon.|2006}}.\n\nBart\u00f3k's body was initially interred in [[Ferncliff Cemetery]] in Hartsdale, New York. During the final year of communist Hungary in the late 1980s, the Hungarian government, along with his two sons, B\u00e9la III and P\u00e9ter, requested that his remains be exhumed and transferred back to [[Budapest]] for burial, where Hungary arranged a [[state funeral]] for him on 7 July 1988. He was reinterred at Budapest's [[Farkasr\u00e9ti Cemetery]], next to the remains of Ditta, who died in 1982, the year after his centenary {{harv|Chalmers |1995|loc=214}}.\n\nThe two unfinished works were later completed by his pupil [[Tibor Serly]]. Gy\u00f6rgy S\u00e1ndor was the soloist in the first performance of the Third Piano Concerto on February&nbsp;8, 1946. Ditta P\u00e1sztory-Bart\u00f3k later played and recorded it. The Viola Concerto was revised and published in the 1990s by Bart\u00f3k's son, Peter {{harv|Maurice|2004|loc={{Page needed|date=October 2017}}}}; this version may be closer to what Bart\u00f3k intended {{harv|Chalmers|1995|loc=210}}.\n\nConcurrently, Peter Bart\u00f3k, in association with Argentinian musician [[Nelson Dellamaggiore]], worked to reprint and revise past editions of the Third Piano Concerto {{harv|Somfai|1996}}.\n\n==Statues==\n[[File:Statue of B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k.JPG|thumb|right|Statue of Bart\u00f3k in [[Mak\u00f3]], Hungary]]\n* A statue of Bart\u00f3k stands in [[Brussels]], Belgium near the central train station in a public square, ''Spanjeplein-Place d'Espagne'' ({{harvnb|Anon.|2014}}; {{harvnb|Dicaire|2010|loc=145}})\n* A statue stands outside Malvern Court, south of [[South Kensington]] [[London Underground|Underground Station]], and just north of 7 Sydney Place, where he stayed when performing in London.

In his search for new forms of tonality, Bart\u00f3k turned to Hungarian folk music, as well as to other folk music of the [[Carpathian Basin]] and even of Algeria and Turkey; in so doing he became influential in that stream of modernism which exploited indigenous music and techniques {{harv|Botstein|[n.d.]|loc=\u00a76}}.\n\nOne characteristic style of music is his [[Night music (Bart\u00f3k)|Night music]], which he used mostly in slow movements of multi-movement ensemble or orchestral compositions in his mature period. It is characterised by \"eerie dissonances providing a backdrop to sounds of nature and lonely melodies\" {{harv|Schneider|2006|loc=84}}. An example is the third movement (Adagio) of his ''Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta''.\n\nHis music can be grouped roughly in accordance with the different periods in his life.\n\n===Early Years (1890\u20131902)===\n\nThe works of Bartok\u2019s youth were written in a classical and early romantic style touched with influences of popular and Gypsy music {{harv|Citron|1963|loc={{Page needed|date=September 2018}}}}. Between 1890 and 1894 (nine to 13 years of age) he wrote 31 piano pieces with corresponding opus numbers. Although most of these were simple dance pieces, in these early works Bartok began to tackle some more advanced forms, as in his ten-part programmatic ''A Duna foly\u00e1sa'' (\u201cThe Course of the Danube\u201d, 1890\u201394), which he played in his first public recital in 1892 {{harv|Cooper}1956|loc=11}}.\n\nIn catholic grammar school Bartok took to studying the scores of composers \"from [[Bach]] to [[Wagner]]\" {{harv|Moreux|1974|loc=18}}, his compositions now advancing in style and taking on similarities to [[Schumann]] and [[Brahms]] {{harv|Cooper|1956|loc=14}}. Following his matriculation into the Budapest Academy in 1890 he composed very little, though he began to work on exercises in orchestration and familiarized himself thoroughly with the operas of Wagner {{harv|Stevens|1993|loc=12}}. In 1902 his creative energies were revitalized the discovery of the music of [[Richard Strauss]], whose tone poem ''Also sprach Zarathustra'', according to Bart\u00f3k, \"stimulated the greatest enthusiasm in me; at last I saw the way that lay before me.\" Bartok also owned the score to [[Ein Heldenleben|''A Hero\u2019s Life'']], which he transcribed for the piano and committed to memory {{harv|Stevens|1993|loc=15\u201316}}.\n\n===New Influences (1903\u201311)===\n\nUnder the influence of Strauss Bart\u00f3k composed in 1903 ''Kossuth'', a symphonic poem in ten tableaux on the subject of the 1848 Hungarian war of independence, reflecting the composers growing interest in musical nationalism {{harv|Stevens|1993|loc=17}}. A year later he renewed his opus numbers with the [[Rhapsody, Op. 1 (Bartok)|''Rhapsody for Piano and Orchestra'']] serving as Opus 1. Driven by nationalistic fervor and a desire to transcend the influence of prior composers, Bartok began a lifelong devotion to folk music which was sparked by his overhearing nanny Lidi D\u00f3sa\u2019s singing of Transylvanian folk songs at a Hungarian resort in 1904 {{harv|Stevens|1993|loc=22}}. Bart\u00f3k began to collect Magyar peasant melodies, later extending to the folk music of other peoples of the Carpathian Basin {{harv|Moreux|1974|loc=60}}. His compositional output would gradually prune away romantic elements in favour of an idiom that embodied folk music as intrinsic and essential to its style. Later in life he would have this to say on the incorporation of folk and art music:\n\n<blockquote>The question is, what are the ways in which peasant music is taken over and becomes transmuted into modern music? We may, for instance, take over a peasant melody unchanged or only slightly varied, write an accompaniment to it and possibly some opening and concluding phrases. This kind of work would show a certain analogy with Bach's treatment of chorales. ... Another method ... is the following: the composer does not make use of a real peasant melody but invents his own imitation of such melodies. There is no true difference between this method and the one described above. ... There is yet a third way ... Neither peasant melodies nor imitations of peasant melodies can be found in his music, but it is pervaded by the atmosphere of peasant music. In this case we may say, he has completely absorbed the idiom of peasant music which has become his musical mother tongue. {{harv|Fisk|1997|loc=271}}</blockquote>\n\nBart\u00f3k became first acquainted with Debussy's music in 1907 and regarded his music highly. In an interview in 1939 Bart\u00f3k said\n<blockquote>\nDebussy's great service to music was to reawaken among all musicians an awareness of harmony and its possibilities. In that, he was just as important as Beethoven, who revealed to us the possibilities of progressive form, or as Bach, who showed us the transcendent significance of counterpoint. Now, what I am always asking myself is this: is it possible to make a synthesis of these three great masters, a living synthesis that will be valid for our time? {{harv|Moreux|1953|loc=92}} </blockquote> Debussy's influence is present in the Fourteen Bagatelles (1908). These made [[Ferruccio Busoni]] exclaim 'At last something truly new!' {{harv|Bart\u00f3k|1948|loc=2:83<!--It would be preferable to cite the letter from the English edition, for the benefit of readers not fluent in Hungarian.-->}}. Until 1911, Bart\u00f3k composed widely differing works which ranged from adherence to romantic-style, to folk song arrangements and to his modernist opera ''Bluebeard's Castle''. The negative reception of his work led him to focus on folk music research after 1911 and abandon composition with the exception of folk music arrangements ({{harvnb|Gillies|1993|loc=404}}; {{harvnb|Stevens|1964|loc=47\u201349}}).\n\n===New inspiration and experimentation (1916\u201321)===\nHis pessimistic attitude towards composing was lifted by the stormy and inspiring contact with Kl\u00e1ra Gombossy in the summer of 1915 {{harv|Gillies|1993|loc=405}}. This interesting episode in Bart\u00f3k's life remained hidden until it was researched by Denijs Dille between 1979 and 1989 {{harv|Dille|1990|loc=257\u201377}}. Bart\u00f3k started composing again, including the Suite for piano opus 14 (1916), and ''The Miraculous Mandarin'' (1918) and he completed ''The Wooden Prince'' (1917).\n\nBart\u00f3k felt the result of World War I as a personal tragedy {{harv|Stevens|1993|loc=3<!--If the page number is from the first edition of 1953, this may require correction. The ISBN cited in the bibliography was for the third edition of 1993.-->}}. Many regions he loved were severed from [[Hungary]]: [[Transylvania]], the [[Banat]] where he was born, and [[Pozsony]] where his mother lived. Additionally, the political relations between Hungary and the other successor states to the [[Austro-Hungarian empire]] prohibited his folk music research outside of Hungary {{harv|Somfai|1996|loc=18}}. Bart\u00f3k also wrote the noteworthy ''[[Eight Improvisations on Hungarian Peasant Songs]]'' in 1920, and the sunny ''[[Dance Suite (Bart\u00f3k)|Dance Suite]]'' in 1923, the year of his second marriage.\n\n===\"Synthesis of East and West\" (1926\u201345)===\nIn 1926, Bart\u00f3k needed a significant piece for piano and orchestra with which he could tour in Europe and America. In the preparation for writing his [[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Bart\u00f3k)|First Piano Concerto]], he wrote his Sonata, ''[[Out of Doors (Bart\u00f3k)|Out of Doors]]'', and ''Nine Little Pieces'', all for solo piano {{harv|Gillies|1993|loc=173}}. He increasingly found his own voice in his maturity. The style of his last period\u2014named \"Synthesis of East and West\" {{harv|Gillies|1993|loc=189}}\u2014is hard to define let alone to put under one term. In his mature period, Bart\u00f3k wrote relatively few works but most of them are large-scale compositions for large settings. Only his voice works have programmatic titles and his late works often adhere to classical forms.\n\nAmong his masterworks are all the six [[List of string quartets by B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k|string quartets]] (1908, 1917, 1927, 1928, 1934, and 1939), the ''[[Cantata Profana]]'' (1930, Bart\u00f3k declared that this was the work he felt and professed to be his most personal \"credo\" {{harv|Szabolcsi|1974|loc=186}}, the ''Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta'' (1936), the Concerto for Orchestra (1943) and the Third Piano Concerto (1945).\n\nBart\u00f3k also made a lasting contribution to the literature for younger students: for his son P\u00e9ter's music lessons, he composed ''[[Mikrokosmos (Bart\u00f3k)|Mikrokosmos]]'', a six-volume collection of graded piano pieces.\n\n==Musical analysis==\n[[File:Bartok Bela Baja.jpg|thumb|right|B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k memorial plaque in [[Baja, Hungary]]]]\n[[File:Musik Meile Wien, B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k (30).jpg|thumb|upright|''Walk of Fame Vienna'']]\n[[Paul Wilson (music theorist)|Paul Wilson]] lists as the most prominent characteristics of Bart\u00f3k's music from late 1920s onwards the influence of the [[Carpathian basin]] and European art music, and his changing attitude toward (and use of) tonality, but without the use of the traditional [[Diatonic functionality|harmonic functions]] associated with major and minor scales {{harv|Wilson|1992|loc=2\u20134}}.\n\nAlthough Bart\u00f3k claimed in his writings that his music was always tonal, he rarely uses the chords or scales of tonality, and so the descriptive resources of tonal theory are of limited use. [[George Perle|George]] {{harvtxt|Perle|1955}} and Elliott {{harvtxt|Antokoletz|1984}} focus on alternative methods of signaling tonal centers, via axes of inversional symmetry. Others view Bart\u00f3k's axes of symmetry in terms of atonal analytic protocols. [[Richard Cohn|Richard]] {{harvtxt|Cohn|1988}} argues that [[Inversion (music)#Inversional equivalency|inversional symmetry]] is often a byproduct of another atonal procedure, the formation of chords from transpositionally related dyads. Atonal pitch-class theory also furnishes the resources for exploring [[polymodal chromaticism]], [[projected set]]s, [[privileged pattern]]s, and large set types used as source sets such as the equal tempered twelve tone [[tone row#total chromatic|aggregate]], [[octatonic scale]] (and [[alpha chord]]), the diatonic and ''heptatonia secunda'' seven-note scales, and less often the whole tone scale and the primary pentatonic collection {{harv|Wilson|1992|loc=24\u201329}}.\n\nHe rarely used the simple aggregate actively to shape musical structure, though there are notable examples such as the second theme from the first movement of his Second Violin Concerto, commenting that he \"wanted to show [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]] that one can use all twelve tones and still remain tonal\" {{harv|Gillies|1990|loc=185}}. More thoroughly, in the first eight measures of the last movement of his Second Quartet, all notes gradually gather with the twelfth (G{{music|\u266d}}) sounding for the first time on the last beat of measure 8, marking the end of the first section. The aggregate is partitioned in the opening of the Third String Quartet with C{{music|\u266f}}\u2013D\u2013D{{music|\u266f}}\u2013E in the accompaniment (strings) while the remaining pitch classes are used in the melody (violin 1) and more often as 7\u201335 (diatonic or \"white-key\" collection) and 5\u201335 (pentatonic or \"black-key\" collection) such as in no. 6 of the ''Eight Improvisations''. There, the primary theme is on the black keys in the left hand, while the right accompanies with triads from the white keys. In measures 50\u201351 in the third movement of the Fourth Quartet, the first violin and cello play black-key chords, while the second violin and viola play stepwise diatonic lines {{harv|Wilson|1992|loc=25}}. On the other hand, from as early as the Suite for piano, Op. 14 (1914), he occasionally employed a form of [[serialism]] based on compound interval cycles, some of which are maximally distributed, multi-aggregate cycles ({{harvnb|Martins|2004}}; {{harvnb|Gollin|2007}}).\n\n[[Image:Bartok - Sonata for two pianos and percussion, 3rd mov. fibonacci.png|thumb|[[Fibonacci number|Fibonacci]] intervals (counting in semitones) in Bart\u00f3k's [[Sonata for Two Pianos and Percussion]], 3rd mov. (1937) ({{harvnb|Maconie|2005|loc=26, 28}}, citing {{harvnb|Lendvai|1972}}) {{audio|Bartok - Sonata for two pianos and percussion, 3rd mov. fibonacci.mid|Play}}]]\n[[Ern\u0151 Lendvai]] (1971) analyses Bart\u00f3k's works as being based on two opposing tonal systems, that of the [[acoustic scale]] and the [[axis system]], as well as using the [[golden ratio|golden section]] as a structural principle.\n\n[[Milton Babbitt]], in his 1949 critique of Bart\u00f3k's string quartets, criticized Bart\u00f3k for using tonality and non tonal methods unique to each piece. Babbitt noted that \"Bart\u00f3k's solution was a specific one, it cannot be duplicated\" {{harv|Babbitt|1949|loc=385}}. Bart\u00f3k's use of \"two organizational principles\"\u2014tonality for large scale relationships and the piece-specific method for moment to moment thematic elements\u2014was a problem for Babbitt, who worried that the \"highly attenuated tonality\" requires extreme non-harmonic methods to create a feeling of closure {{harv|Babbitt|1949|loc=377\u201378}}.\n\n==Catalogues and opus numbers==\nThe cataloguing of Bart\u00f3k's works is somewhat complex. Bart\u00f3k assigned opus numbers to his works three times, the last of these series ending with the Sonata for Violin and Piano No. 1, Op. 21 in 1921. He ended this practice because of the difficulty of distinguishing between original works and ethnographic arrangements, and between major and minor works. Since his death, three attempts\u2014two full and one partial\u2014have been made at cataloguing. The first, and still most widely used, is [[Andr\u00e1s Sz\u0151ll\u0151sy]]'s chronological Sz. numbers, from 1 to 121. [[Denijs Dille]] subsequently reorganised the juvenilia (Sz. 1\u201325) thematically, as DD numbers 1 to 77. The most recent catalogue is that of [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Somfai]]; this is a chronological index with works identified by BB numbers 1 to 129, incorporating corrections based on the B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k Thematic Catalogue.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}\n\nOn 1 January 2016, his works entered the [[public domain]] in the [[European Union]] {{harv|Anon.|2016}}.\n\n==Discography==\n\nTogether with his like-minded contemporary [[Zoltan Kodaly]], Bartok embarked on an extensive programme of field research to capture the folk and peasant melodies of [[Hungarian language|Magyar]],  [[Slovak language|Slovak]] and Rumanian language territories {{harv|Moreux|1974|loc=60}}. At first they would transcribe the melodies by hand, but later they began to use a wax cylinder recording machine invented by [[Thomas Edison]] {{harv|Music|2018}}. Compilations of Bart\u00f3k\u2019s field recordings, interviews, and original piano playing have been released over the years, largely by the Hungarian record label Hungaroton:\n* Bart\u00f3k, B\u00e9la. 1994.

The next few years, continuing this story in a fairy-tale manner, were hard and poverty-stricken, but crammed full of useful experience. Apart from learning how to exist on one meal a day and other artistic exercises, he worked at an open-air park show, sang and yodelled with any band that would have him, and worked with a traveling medicine show. Eventually he got a job with a popular group known as the \"Down Homers\" while they were in [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]], [[Connecticut]]. Soon after this he decided, as all successful people must decide at some time or another, to be his own boss again \u2013 and he has been that ever since.' These notes fail to account for his early band, known as the Four Aces of Western Swing. During the 1940s Haley was considered one of the top cowboy yodelers in America as \"Silver Yodeling Bill Haley\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hillbilly-music.com/artists/story/index.php?id=13813 |title=Bill Haley and the Saddlemen |publisher=Hillbilly-Music.com |date=February 9, 1981 |accessdate=November 4, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe sleeve notes conclude: \"For six years Bill Haley was a musical director of Radio Station [[WPWA]] in [[Chester, Pennsylvania|Chester]], Pennsylvania, and led his own band all through this period. It was then known as Bill Haley's Saddlemen, indicating their definite leaning toward the tough Western style. They continued playing in clubs as well as over the radio around [[Philadelphia]], and in 1951 made their first recordings on Ed Wilson's Keystone Records in Philadelphia.\"  On June 14, 1951 the Saddlemen recorded a cover of \"[[Rocket 88]]\".\n\n===Bill Haley and His Comets===\n[[Image:Bill Haley, 1974, Li\u00e9ge 1.jpg|thumb|upright|Bill Haley and the Comets performing in 1974]]\n{{main|Bill Haley & His Comets}}\nDuring the Labor Day weekend in 1952, the Saddlemen were renamed '''Bill Haley with Haley's Comets''' (inspired by the supposedly official pronunciation of [[Halley's Comet]], a name suggested by WPWA radio station program director, Bob Johnson, where Bill Haley had a live radio program from noon to 1 pm), and in 1953, Haley's recording of \"[[Crazy Man, Crazy]]\" (co-written by him and his bass player, [[Marshall Lytle]], although Lytle would not receive credit until 2001) became the first rock and roll song to hit the American charts, peaking at number 15 on ''Billboard'' and number 11 on ''Cash Box''. Soon after, the band's name was revised to \"Bill Haley & His Comets\".\n\nIn 1953, \"[[Rock Around the Clock]]\" was recorded by Haley.<ref>Dawson 2005</ref> Initially, it was relatively successful, peaking at number  23 on the ''Billboard'' pop singles chart and staying on the charts for a few weeks. A month later it re-entered at number one.\n\nHaley soon had another worldwide hit with \"[[Shake, Rattle and Roll]]\", which went on to sell a million copies and was the first rock 'n' roll song to enter the British singles charts in December 1954, becoming a gold record. He retained elements of the original (which was slow blues), but sped it up with some country music aspects into the song (specifically, Western swing) and changed up the lyrics. Haley and his band were important in launching the music known as \"Rock and Roll\" to a wider audience after a period of it being considered an underground genre.\n\nWhen \"Rock Around the Clock\" appeared as the theme song of the 1955 film ''[[Blackboard Jungle]]'' starring [[Glenn Ford]], it soared to the top of the American ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' chart for eight weeks. The single is commonly used as a convenient line of demarcation between the \"rock era\" and the music industry that preceded it. ''Billboard'' separated its statistical tabulations into 1890\u20131954 and 1955\u2013present. After the record rose to number one, Haley was quickly given the title \"Father of Rock and Roll\" by the media, and by teenagers who had come to embrace the new style of music. With the song's success, the age of rock music began overnight and ended the dominance of the jazz and pop standards performed by [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Jo Stafford]], [[Perry Como]], [[Bing Crosby]], and others. Nevertheless, in the United Kingdom, Haley was supported by former Dankworth Seven lead vocalist [[Frank Holder (musician)|Frank Holder]] among others.\n\n\"Rock Around the Clock\" was the first record to sell over one million copies in both [[UK|Britain]] and [[West Germany|Germany]]. Later on in 1957, Haley became the first major American rock singer to tour Europe. Haley continued to score hits throughout the 1950s such as \"[[See You Later, Alligator]]\" and he starred in the first rock and roll musical films ''[[Rock Around the Clock (film)|Rock Around the Clock]]'' and ''[[Don't Knock the Rock]]'', both in 1956. Haley was already 30 years old, so he was soon eclipsed in the United States by the younger, sexier [[Elvis Presley]], but continued to enjoy great popularity in Latin America, Europe, and Australia during the 1960s.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Bill Haley Elvis Presley 1955 Cleveland.jpg|left|thumb|Bill Haley and Elvis Presley at the Brooklyn High School Auditorium, Cleveland, Ohio, October 20, 1955{{ffdc|1=Bill Haley Elvis Presley 1955 Cleveland.jpg|log=2018 March 29}}]] -->\nBill Haley and the Comets performed \"Rock Around the Clock\" on the ''[[Texaco Star Theater]]'' hosted by [[Milton Berle]] on Tuesday, May 31, 1955, on [[NBC]] in an'' a cappella'' and lip-synched version. Berle predicted that the song would go number one: \"A group of entertainers who are going right to the top.\" Berle also sang and danced to the song which was performed by the entire cast of the show. This was one of the earliest nationally televised performances by a rock and roll band and provided the new musical genre with a much wider audience.\n\nBill Haley and the Comets were the first rock and roll act to appear on the iconic American musical variety series the ''[[Ed Sullivan Show]]'' on Sunday, August 7, 1955, on [[CBS]] in a broadcast that originated from the Shakespeare Festival Theater in Hartford, Connecticut. They performed a live version of \"Rock Around the Clock\" with Franny Beecher on lead guitar and Dick Richards on drums. The band made their second appearance on the show on Sunday, April 28, 1957, performing the songs \"[[Rudy's Rock]]\" and \"Forty Cups of Coffee\".\n\nBill Haley and the Comets appeared on ''[[American Bandstand]]'' hosted by [[Dick Clark]] on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] twice in 1957, on the prime time show October 28, 1957, and on the regular daytime show on November 27, 1957. The band also appeared on Dick Clark's ''Saturday Night Beechnut Show'', also known as ''[[The Dick Clark Show]]'', a primetime TV series from New York on March 22, 1958, during the first season and on February 20, 1960, performing \"Rock Around the Clock\", \"Shake, Rattle and Roll\", and \"Tamiami\".\n\n=== Personal life ===\n\n====Marriages====\nBill Haley was married three times:\n* Dorothy Crowe \t(11 December 1946 - 14 November 1952) (divorced) (two children)\n* Barbara Joan Cupchak \t(18 November 1952 - 1960) (divorced) (five children)\n* Martha Velasco \t(1963 - 9 February 1981; his death) (three children)<ref>https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0006426/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm</ref>\n\n====Children====\nBill Haley had at least ten children.

Nonetheless, he and his band continued to be a popular touring act, benefiting from a 1950s nostalgia movement that began in the late 1960s and the signing of a lucrative record deal with the European [[Sonet Records|Sonet]] label. After performing for [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] at the [[Royal Variety Performance]] on November 10, 1979, Haley made his final performances in South Africa in May and June 1980. Before the South African tour, he was diagnosed with a [[brain tumor]], and a planned tour of [[Germany]] in the autumn of 1980 was cancelled.\n\nThe October 25, 1980 issue of German tabloid ''[[Bild]]'' reported that Haley had a brain tumor, quoting British manager Patrick Malynn as saying that Haley \"had taken a fit [and] didn't recognize anyone any more\" after being taken to his home in Beverly Hills, in addition to the paper quoting a doctor that the tumor was inoperable.<ref name=\"Bill Haley 1982. page 154\">Bill Haley: The Daddy of Rock and Roll.

The doctor prescribed a medication to stop the overproduction, but said Bill would have to stop drinking. Martha said, \"This is pointless.\" She took him home, however, fed him and gave him his first dose.

Liner notes for a 2003 CD release by [[Hydra Records]] entitled ''Bill Haley and Friends Vol. 2: The Legendary Cowboy Recordings'' reveal that several additional Cowboy label single releases were planned for the Four Aces, but this never occurred.\n\nA number of previously unreleased Haley country-western recordings from the 1946\u20131950 period began to emerge near the end of Haley's life, some of which were released by the [[Arzee Records|Arzee]] label, with titles such as \"Yodel Your Blues Away\" and \"Rose of My Heart.\" Still more demos, alternate takes, and wholly unheard-before recordings have been released since Haley's death. Notable examples of such releases include the albums ''Golden Country Origins'' by [[Grassroots Records]] of Australia and ''Hillbilly Haley'' by the British label, [[Rollercoaster Records|Rollercoaster]], as well as the aforementioned German release by Hydra Records.

It is a member of the group of species known as [[New World quail]]s (Odontophoridae). They were initially placed with the Old World quails in the pheasant [[family (biology)|family]] ([[Phasianidae]]), but are not particularly closely related. The name \"[[Colinus|bobwhite]]\" derives from its characteristic whistling call. Despite its secretive nature, the northern bobwhite is one of the most familiar quails in eastern North America because it is frequently the only quail in its range. Habitat degradation has likely contributed to the northern bobwhite population in eastern North America declining by roughly 85% from 1966-2014.<ref>{{cite web|title=Northern Bobwhite|url=https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Northern_Bobwhite/lifehistory|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=2017-02-14}}</ref> This population decline is apparently range-wide and continuing.<ref>{{cite web|title=The 116th Christmas Bird Count Summary|url=http://www.audubon.org/news/the-116th-christmas-bird-count-summary|publisher=National Audubon Society|accessdate=2017-02-22}}</ref>\n\nThere are 21 [[subspecies]] of northern bobwhite, many of which are hunted extensively as [[game birds]]. One subspecies, the masked bobwhite (''Colinus virginianus ridgwayi''), is listed as endangered with wild populations located in the northern Mexican state of [[Sonora]] and a reintroduced population in [[Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge]] in [[southern Arizona]].\n\n==Description==\nThis is a moderately-sized [[quail]] and is the only small galliform native to eastern North America. The bobwhite can range from {{convert|24|to|28|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length with a {{convert|33|to|38|cm|in|abbr=on}} wingspan. As indicated by body mass, weights increase in birds found further north, as corresponds to [[Bergmann's rule]]. In Mexico, northern bobwhites weigh from {{convert|129|to|159|g|oz|abbr=on}} whereas in the north they average {{convert|170|to|173|g|oz|abbr=on}} and large males can attain as much as {{convert|255|g|oz|abbr=on}}.<ref>''Pheasants, Partridges, and Grouse : A Guide to the Pheasants, Partridges, Quails, Grouse, Guineafowl, Buttonquails, and Sandgrouse of the World (Princeton Field Guides)'' by Tami Davis Biddle.

This species is [[Sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]]. Males have a white throat and brow stripe bordered by black. The overall rufous plumage has gray mottling on the wings, white scalloped stripes on the flanks, and black scallops on the whitish underparts. The tail is gray. Females are similar but are duller overall and have a buff throat and brow without the black border. Both sexes have pale legs and feet.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n\n===Subspecies===\n[[File:76 Virginian Partridge.jpg|thumb|230px|right|<center>Plate 76 of ''[[Birds of America (book)|Birds of America]]'' by [[John James Audubon]] depicting Virginian Partridge.</center>]]\nThere are twenty-one recognized [[subspecies]] in 3 groups. 1 subspecies is extinct.\n*Eastern Group\n** ''C. v. aridus'' ([[George Newbold Lawrence|Lawrence]], 1853) - Jaumave bobwhite - west-central [[Tamaulipas]] to southeastern [[San Luis Potos\u00ed]]\n** ''C. v. cubanensis'' ([[George Robert Gray|GR Gray]], 1846) - Cuban bobwhite - [[Cuba]] and the [[Isla de la Juventud|Isle of Pines]]\n** ''C. v. floridanus'' ([[Elliott Coues|Coues]], 1872) - Florida bobwhite - peninsular [[Florida]]\n** ''C. v. insulanus'' (Howe, 1904) - Key West bobwhite - [[Florida Keys]]\u2020\n** ''C. v. maculatus'' ([[Edward William Nelson|Nelson]], 1899) - spot-bellied bobwhite - central Tamaulipas to northern [[Veracruz]] and southeastern San Luis Potos\u00ed\n** ''C. v. marilandicus'' (Linnaeus, 1758) - coastal [[New England]] to [[Pennsylvania]] and central [[Virginia]]\n** ''C. v. mexicanus'' (Linnaeus, 1766) - eastern United States west of [[East Coast of the United States|Atlantic Seaboard]] to [[Great Plains]]\n** ''C. v. taylori'' (Lincoln, 1915) - plains bobwhite - [[South Dakota]] to northern [[Texas]], western [[Missouri]] and northwest [[Arkansas]]\n** ''C. v. texanus'' ([[George Newbold Lawrence|Lawrence]], 1853) - Texas bobwhite - southwest Texas to northern [[Mexico]]\n** ''C. v. virginianus'' (Linnaeus, 1758) - nominate - Atlantic coast from Virginia to northern Florida and southeast [[Alabama]]\n*Grayson's Group\n** ''C. v. graysoni'' (Lawrence, 1867) - Grayson's bobwhite - west central Mexico\n** ''C. v. nigripectus'' (Nelson, 2015) - puebla bobwhite - eastern Mexico\n*Black-breasted Group\n** ''C. v. godmani'' (Nelson, 1897) - Godman's bobwhite - eastern slopes and mountains of central [[Veracruz]]\n** ''C. v. minor'' (Nelson, 1901) - least bobwhite - northeast [[Chiapas]] and [[Tabasco]]\n** ''C. v. pectoralis'' ([[John Gould|Gould]], 1883) - black-breasted bobwhite - eastern slopes and mountains of central [[Veracruz]]\n** ''C. v. thayeri'' ([[Outram Bangs|Bangs]] and [[James Lee Peters|Peters]], 1928) - Thayer's bobwhite - northeast [[Oaxaca]]\n*Masked Group\n** ''C. v. atriceps'' ([[William Robert Ogilvie-Grant|Ogilvie-Grant]], 1893) - black-headed bobwhite - interior of western Oaxaca\n** ''C. v. coyolcos'' ([[Philipp Ludwig Statius M\u00fcller|Statius M\u00fcller]], 1776) - Coyolcos bobwhite - Pacific Coast of Oaxaca and [[Chiapas]]\n** ''C. v. harrisoni'' (Orr and Webster, 1968) - southwest Oaxaca\n** ''C. v. insignis'' (Nelson, 1897) - Guatemalan bobwhite - Guatemala and southern Chiapas\n** ''C. v. ridgwayi'' ([[William Brewster (ornithologist)|Brewster]], 1885) - masked bobwhite - north central [[Sonora]]\n** ''C. v. salvini'' (Nelson, 1897) - Salvin's bobwhite - coastal and southern Chiapas\n\n==Diet==\nThe northern bobwhite's diet consists of plant material and small invertebrates, such as [[tick]]s, [[snail]]s, [[grasshopper]]s, [[potato beetle|beetle]]s, spiders, crickets, and leafhoppers.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Butler|first=DA|last2=Palmer|first2=WE|last3=Cook|first3=MP|date=2012|title=The invertebrate diet of northern bobwhite chicks in Georgia, United States|url=|journal=Animal Biodiversity and Conservation|volume=35.2|pages=415-418|via=}}</ref> Plant sources include seeds, wild berries, [[partridge pea]]s, and cultivated grains.

Its range covers the southeastern quadrant of the [[United States]] from the [[Great Lakes]] and southern [[Minnesota]] east to [[Pennsylvania]] and southern [[Massachusetts]], and extending west to southern [[Nebraska]], [[Kansas]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Colorado]] front-range foothills to 7000 feet, and all but westernmost [[Texas]]. It is absent from the southern tip of [[Florida]] and the highest elevations of the [[Appalachian Mountains]], but occurs in eastern [[Mexico]] and in [[Cuba]]. Isolated populations have been introduced in [[Oregon]] and [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. The northern bobwhite has also been [[introduced species|introduced]] to [[New Zealand]].\n\n==Vocalizations==\nThe clear whistle \"bob-WHITE\" or \"bob-bob-WHITE\" call is very recognizable. The syllables are slow and widely spaced, rising in pitch a full octave from beginning to end. Other calls include [[lisp]]s, peeps, and more rapidly whistled warning calls. Another phrase to used mimic the call of the bobwhite is \"Bobwhite, your (bob) peas (bob) ripe (white)?\".{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n==Behavior==\n[[File:Colin de Virginie MHNT.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Egg]]\nLike most game birds, the northern bobwhite is shy and elusive. When threatened, it will crouch and freeze, relying on camouflage to stay undetected, but will flush into low flight if closely disturbed. It is generally solitary or paired early in the year, but family groups are common in the late summer and winter roosts may have two dozen or more birds in a single covey.\n\n==Reproduction==\nThe species was once considered monogamous, but with the advent of radio telemetry, the sexual behavior of bobwhites has better been described as ambisexual polygamy.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Beef, Brush, and Bobwhites|last=Hernandez|first=F|publisher=Texas A&M University Press|year=2012|isbn=9781603444750|location=|pages=}}</ref> Either parent may incubate a clutch for 23 days, and the precocial young leave the nest shortly after hatching.

Westerskov, MSc, PhD. Complete Book of New Zealand Birds</ref> from Northland to Southland. The bird was briefly on the Nelson game shooting licence, but: \"It would seem that the committee was a little too eager in placing these Quail on the licence, or the shooters of the day were over-zealous and greedy in their bag limits, for the Virginian Quail, like the Mountain Quail were soon thing of the past.\"<ref>Ann.Rep. Nelson Acclimatisation Society, 1968:38</ref> The Taranaki (Acclimatisation) Society released a few in 1900 and was confidant that in a year or two they might offer good sport; two years later, broods were reported and the species was said to be ''steadily increasing''; but after another two years they seemed ''to have disappeared'' and that was the end of them. The Otago (Acclimatisation) Society imported more in 1948,<ref>Ann.Rep. Otago Acclimatisation Society, 1948</ref> but these releases ''did no good''.<ref>Ann.Rep. North Canterbury Acclimatisation Society, 1954:21</ref><ref>Gamekeepers for the Nation, 1994, R.M. McDowell</ref> After 1923, no more genuinely wild birds were sighted until 1952, when a small population was found North-West of Wairoa in the Ruapapa Road area. Since then bobwhite have been found at several localities around Waikaremoana, in farmland, open bush and along roadsides.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\nMore birds have been imported into [[New Zealand]] by private individuals since the 1990s and a healthy captive population is now held by backyard aviculturalists and have been found to be easily cared for, bred, and are popular for their song and good looks. A larger proportion of the national captive population belong to a few game preserves and game bird breeders. Though the birds would be self-sustaining in the wild if they were protected; it is tricky to guess what the effect of an annual population subsidy and hunting has on any of the original populations from the Acclimatisation Society releases. It would be fair to suggest most birds in the wild are no more than one generation from captive stock.\n\nAn [[albino]] hen was present in a [[covey]] in Bayview, Hawkes Bay for a couple of seasons sometime around 2000.<ref>J.J. Holland</ref>\n\n=== Captive populations ===\n\nBobwhites are popular throughout the world, with healthy captive populations everywhere where bird-keeping is enjoyed. Certain countries/states require permits and record keeping, as the possibility that an introduced population may compete with or spread diseases with native quail is a real threat.\n\n==Captivity==\n[[File:Domesticated quail.png|thumb|Domesticated northern bobwhite]]\n=== Housing ===\n\nBobwhites are generally compatible with most [[parrots]], [[softbills]] and [[dove]]. This species should, however, be the only ground-dwelling species in the aviary. Most individuals will do little damage to [[finches]], but one should watch that nests are not being crushed when the species perches at night. Single pairs are preferred, unless the birds have been raised together as a group since they were chicks. Some fighting will occur between cocks at breeding time. One cock may be capable of servicing several hens at once, but the fertility seems to be highest in the eggs from the ''preferred'' hen. Aviary style is a compromise between what is tolerated by the bird and what is best for the bird. Open parrot-style type aviaries may be used, but some birds will remain flighty and shy in this situation. In a planted aviary, this species will generally settle down to become quite tame and confiding. Parents with chicks will roost on the ground, forming a circular arrangement, with heads facing outwards. In the early morning and late afternoon, the cock will utter its call, which, although not loud, carries well and may offend noise-sensitive neighbors. Most breeding facilities keep birds in breeding groups, on wire up off the ground. This keeps the birds clean and generally avoids diseases and parasites which can devastate a covey. Cages with mesh floors for pairs and trios are also employed, but usually where there is a photo-period manipulation to keep birds breeding through winter.\n\n=== Feeding ===\n\nIn the wild the bobwhite feeds on a variety of seeds of weeds, grasses, as well as insects. These are generally collected on the ground or from low foliage. Birds in the aviary are easily catered for with a commercial small seed mix (finch, budgerigar, or small parrot mix) when supplemented with greenfeed. Live food is not usually necessary for breeding, but will be ravenously accepted. High protein foods such as chicken grower crumble are more convenient to supply and will be useful for the stimulation of breeding birds. Extra [[calcium]] is required, especially by laying hens; it can be supplied in the form of shell grit, or [[cuttlefish]] bone.\n\n=== Breeding ===\n\nIn an open aviary hens will lay all over the show if a nesting site and privacy are not provided. Hens that do this may lay upwards of 80 eggs in a season which can be taken for artificial incubation -  and chicks hand raised. Otherwise hens with nesting cover, that do make a nest (on the ground) will build up 8\u201325 eggs in a clutch, with eggs being laid daily\n\n=== Mutations and hybrids ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}\nSome captive bobwhite hybrids recorded are between [[blue quail]] ([[scaled quail]]), [[Gambel's quail]], [[California quail]], [[mountain quail]] and it has long been suggested that there are [[Japanese quail]] hybrids being bred commercially; there is a distinct lack of photographic proof to substantiate this. Inter-subspecific hybrids have been common.\n\nSeveral mutations have long been established, including Californian Jumbo, Wisconsin Jumbo, Northern Giant, Albino, Snowflake, Blonde, Fawn, Barred, Silver, and Red.\n\n==Similar species==\nThe Central American [[spot-bellied bobwhite]] looks very similar, but lacks black facial coloration. The Asian [[rain quail]] is smaller in size and has a black breast.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Colinus virginianus|Northern Bobwhite}}\n{{Wikispecies|Colinus virginianus}}\n{{Collier's Poster|Virginian Quail}}\n* [http://www.seattleaudubon.org/birdweb/bird_details.aspx?id=127 Northern Bobwhite at BirdWeb (seattleaudubon.org)]\n* [http://birding.about.com/od/birdprofiles/p/Northern-Bobwhite.htm Northern Bobwhite info] at About.com\n* [http://bringbackbobwhites.org/ National Bobwhite Conservation Initiative]\n* {{InternetBirdCollection|northern-bobwhite-colinus-virginianus|Northern Bobwhite}}\n* {{VIREO|Northern+Bobwhite|Northern Bobwhite}}\n* {{IUCN_Map|22728956|Colinus virginianus}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q142651}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:bobwhite, northern}}\n[[Category:Colinus|northern bobwhite]]\n[[Category:Birds of the United States]]\n[[Category:Birds of Mexico]]\n[[Category:Birds of Cuba]]\n[[Category:Birds described in 1758|northern bobwhite]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus]]\n[[Category:Game birds]]", "sha1": "5y5882dkjvi27j5wxud6069lqigqj15"}}, {"title": "Bluescreen", "ns": "0", "id": "4530", "redirect": {"title": "Blue screen"}, "revision": {"id": "574587516", "parentid": "574580012", "timestamp": "2013-09-26T10:59:59Z", "contributor": {"username": "Largoplazo", "id": "2766075"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Reverted 3 edits by [[Special:Contributions/Evyrosita123|Evyrosita123]] ([[User talk:Evyrosita123|talk]]) to last revision by Kephir.

There is evidence that it becomes less prevalent with age but nevertheless accounts for a similar percentage of psychiatric admissions; that older bipolar patients had first experienced symptoms at a later age; that later onset of mania is associated with more neurologic impairment; that substance abuse is considerably less common in older groups; and that there is probably a greater degree of variation in presentation and course, for instance individuals may develop new-onset mania associated with vascular changes, or become manic only after recurrent depressive episodes, or may have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder at an early age and still meet criteria. There is also some weak and not conclusive evidence that mania is less intense and there is a higher prevalence of mixed episodes, although there may be a reduced response to treatment.

Initially known for playing \"tough guys\", he went on to achieve success with more complex and challenging roles. He was nominated four times for [[Academy Awards]], and won once for his work in ''[[Elmer Gantry (film)|Elmer Gantry]]'' in 1960. He also won a [[Golden Globe Award]] for that performance and [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA Awards]] for ''[[Birdman of Alcatraz (film)|Birdman of Alcatraz]]'' (1962) and ''[[Atlantic City (1980 film)|Atlantic City]]'' (1980).\n\nDuring the 1950s his production company [[Hecht-Hill-Lancaster]] was highly successful, making films such as ''[[Trapeze (film)|Trapeze]]'' (1956), ''[[Sweet Smell of Success]]'' (1957), ''[[Run Silent, Run Deep (1958 film)|Run Silent, Run Deep]]'' (1958), and ''[[Separate Tables (film)|Separate Tables]]'' (1958). The [[American Film Institute]] ranks Lancaster as #19 of the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars|greatest male stars]] of classic Hollywood cinema.<ref>[http://afi.com/100years/stars.aspx \"AFI's 50 GREATEST AMERICAN SCREEN LEGENDS\"] ''[[American Film Institute]].''

All four of his grandparents were [[Irish people|Irish]] immigrants to the United States, from the province of [[Ulster]]; his maternal grandparents were from [[Belfast]] and were descendants of [[English people|English]] immigrants to Ireland.<ref name=\"buford p. 12\"/> Lancaster grew up in [[East Harlem]] and spent much of his time on the streets, where he developed a great interest and skill in gymnastics while attending [[DeWitt Clinton High School]], where he was a basketball star. Before he graduated from DeWitt Clinton, his mother died of a [[cerebral hemorrhage]]. Lancaster was accepted by [[New York University]] with an athletic scholarship, but subsequently dropped out.<ref>Buford 2008, p. 28.</ref>\n\n==Circus and military careers==\n {{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 220\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1    = Circus-Lancaster-Cravat.jpg\n| alt1      =\n| caption1  = Lancaster and [[Nick Cravat]], performing with the [[Federal Theatre Project]] Circus (1935\u201338)\n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2    = Circus-Lancaster.jpg\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  = Cravat and Lancaster performing on the horizontal bars\n<!-- Image 3 -->\n| image3    =Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr in From Here to Eternity trailer.jpg\n| alt3      =\n| caption3  = With [[Deborah Kerr]] in ''[[From Here to Eternity]]'' (1953)\n}}\nAt 19, Lancaster met [[Nick Cravat]], with whom he developed a lifelong partnership. Together they learned to act in local theatre productions and circus arts at [[Union Settlement Association|Union Settlement]], one of the city's oldest settlement houses.<ref>Andreychuk 2005, p. 3.</ref> They formed the acrobat duo Lang and Cravat in the 1930s, and soon joined the Kay Brothers circus. However, in 1939, an injury forced Lancaster to give up the profession, with great regret. He then found temporary work, first as a salesman for [[Marshall Fields]] and then as a singing waiter in various restaurants.<ref>Andreychuk 2005, p. 6.</ref>\n\nWith the United States having then entered [[World War II]], Lancaster joined the [[United States Army]] in 1942 and performed with the Army's 21st [[Special Services (entertainment)|Special Services]] Division, one of the military groups organized to follow the troops on the ground and provide [[USO]] entertainment to keep up morale. He served with General [[Mark W. Clark|Mark Clark]]'s [[United States Army North|Fifth Army]] in Italy from 1943 to 1945.<ref>Andreychuk 2005, p. 7.</ref>\n\n==Film career==\n===Acting===\n[[File:Killers001.jpg|left|thumb|With [[Ava Gardner]] in ''[[The Killers (1946 film)|The Killers]]'' (1946)]]\nAlthough initially unenthusiastic about acting, Lancaster auditioned for a Broadway play after returning to New York from his Army service, and was offered a role. Although [[Harry Brown (writer)|Harry Brown]]'s ''[[Eight Iron Men|A Sound of Hunting]]'' had a run of only three weeks, Lancaster's performance attracted the interest of a Hollywood agent, [[Harold Hecht]] and, through him, Lancaster was brought to the attention of producer [[Hal B. Wallis]], who signed him to an eight-movie contract. Lancaster's first filmed movie was ''[[Desert Fury]]''. But producer [[Mark Hellinger]] approached him to star in ''[[The Killers (1946 film)|The Killers]]'', in 1946, which was completed and released prior to ''Desert Fury'' and to great critical success.\n\nThe tall, muscular actor won significant acclaim and appeared in two more films the following year. Subsequently, he played in a variety of films, especially in dramas, [[Thriller film|thrillers]], and military and adventure films. In two, ''[[The Flame and the Arrow]]'' and ''[[The Crimson Pirate]]'', his friend from his circus years, Nick Cravat, played a key supporting role, and both actors impressed audiences with their acrobatic prowess.\n\nIn 1953, Lancaster played one of his best-remembered roles with [[Deborah Kerr]] in ''[[From Here to Eternity]]''. The [[American Film Institute]] acknowledged the iconic status of the scene from that film in which he and Deborah Kerr make love on a Hawaiian beach amid the crashing waves. The organization named it one of \"AFI's top 100 Most Romantic Films\" of all time.\n\nLancaster won the 1960 Academy Award for Best Actor, a Golden Globe Award, and the [[New York Film Critics Award]] for his performance in ''[[Elmer Gantry (film)|Elmer Gantry]]''. He followed this with widely diverse roles, including a [[Nazi]] on trial for [[war crimes]] in ''[[Judgment at Nuremberg]]'', a convict serving a life sentence in ''[[Birdman of Alcatraz]]'', and a proud Italian nobleman in ''[[The Leopard (1963 film)|The Leopard]]''. He also played a US Air Force general attempting a coup in the political thriller ''[[Seven Days in May]]''.\n\n[[File:Burt Lancaster 1960.jpg|thumb|left|Drawing of Lancaster after he won an Oscar for ''Elmer Gantry'' (1960). Artist: [[Nicholas Volpe]]]]\nIn 1966, at the age of 52, Lancaster appeared nude in director [[Frank Perry]]'s film ''[[The Swimmer (1968 film)|The Swimmer]]'', in what the critic [[Roger Ebert]] called \"his finest performance\".<ref name=\"Ebert\">{{cite news|first=Roger|last=Ebert|authorlink=Roger Ebert|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-swimmer-1968|title=Review: \"The Swimmer\"|newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|publisher=[[Sun-Times Media Group]]|location=Chicago, Illinois|date=July 2, 1968|accessdate=October 24, 2018|via=RogerEbert.com}}</ref> Prior to working on ''The Swimmer'', Lancaster was terrified of the water because he did not know how to swim. In preparation for the film, he took swimming lessons from [[University of California Los Angeles|UCLA]] swim coach Bob Horn.<ref name=\"StoryOftheSwimmer\">{{cite AV media|people=[[Chris Innis|Innis, Chris]]|url=http://grindhousereleasing.com/?tag=story-of-the-swimmer|chapter=The Story of The Swimmer|title=The Swimmer|publisher=[[Grindhouse Releasing]]|location=Los Angeles, California|edition=2014|format=Blu-ray/DVD}}</ref> The film was not released until 1968, when it proved to be a commercial failure, though Lancaster remained proud of the movie and his performance.\n\nLancaster co-starred with [[Lee Marvin]] in the 1966 western adventure film, ''[[The Professionals (1966 film)|The Professionals]]'', and with [[Dean Martin]] in the first of the so-called [[disaster film]] blockbusters, ''[[Airport (1970 film)|Airport]]'', one of the biggest box-office hits of 1970 and, at that time, reportedly the highest-grossing film in the history of [[Universal Pictures]].\n\nDuring the latter part of his career, Lancaster left adventure and acrobatic films behind and portrayed more distinguished characters. This period brought him work on several international productions, with directors such as [[Luchino Visconti]], [[Bernardo Bertolucci]] and [[Louis Malle]]. His last Oscar nomination was for Malle's 1980 film ''[[Atlantic City (1980 film)|Atlantic City]]''.\n\nLancaster sought demanding roles, and if he liked a part or a director, he was prepared to work for much lower pay than he might have earned elsewhere. He even helped to finance movies in whose artistic value he believed. He also mentored directors such as [[Sydney Pollack]] and [[John Frankenheimer]], and appeared in several television films. Lancaster's last film was ''[[Field of Dreams]]'' (1989).\n\nFor his contribution to the motion picture industry, Lancaster has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6801 Hollywood Boulevard.\n\n===Producing and directing===\n[[File:Burt Lancaster - Audrey Hepburn - 1960.JPG|thumb|left|With [[Audrey Hepburn]] in ''[[The Unforgiven (1960 film)|The Unforgiven]]'' (1960)]]\nLancaster was an early and successful actor/producer. When approached to venture into the film business, after having been in the theater for only a brief period, he chose not to sign with a major studio. Instead he signed with agent [[Harold Hecht]], who promised him the opportunity to produce their own movies within five years of hitting Hollywood. Hecht kept his promise and the two formed a partnership production company under the name Norma Productions, named after Lancaster's wife. Their first movie together was ''[[Kiss the Blood Off My Hands]]'', released in 1948. Hecht and Lancaster produced two additional films in the early 1950s under the Norma Productions company; ''[[The Flame and the Arrow]]'' in 1950 and ''[[Ten Tall Men]]'' in 1951, two [[swashbucklers]] selected to showcase Lancaster's acrobatic skills.\n\nIn 1951 the actor/producer duo changed the company's name to Hecht-Lancaster Productions. The first film under the new name was another swashbuckler: ''[[The Crimson Pirate]]'', released in 1952. This was followed by ''[[Apache (film)|Apache]]'' two years later. In 1954 Lancaster was hired to star in the [[Warner Brothers]] film ''[[His Majesty O'Keefe]]''. This proved to be a turning point for both Lancaster and his company. Lancaster had insisted that the film be produced by Hecht. ''His Majesty O'Keefe'' featured a new Hollywood writer on board. [[James Hill (producer)|James Hill]] immediately hit it off with Lancaster and Hecht, and he was invited to co-produce upcoming Hecht-Lancaster films, giving up his writer position. His first as a producer was ''[[Vera Cruz (film)|Vera Cruz]]'', released in 1954.\n\nWithout Hill, Hecht and Lancaster produced ''[[Marty (film)|Marty]]'', a 1955 film starring [[Ernest Borgnine]], which won both the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] and the [[Palme d'Or]] award at the [[Cannes Film Festival]]. ''Marty'' was also the first film produced by the company not to feature Lancaster in an acting role. ''Vera Cruz'' had been a huge success but ''Marty'' secured Hecht-Lancaster as one of the most successful independent production companies in Hollywood at the time. ''[[The Kentuckian]]'' (1955) was directed by Lancaster in his [[directorial debut]].\n\nIn 1955 Hill was made an equal partner in the company and the name was upgraded to [[Hecht-Hill-Lancaster]], releasing their first film in 1956, ''[[Trapeze (film)|Trapeze]]'', in which Lancaster performed many of his own stunts. ''Trapeze'' went on to become the production company's top box office success. Following ''Trapeze'' Lancaster worked with [[Tony Curtis]] again on ''[[Sweet Smell of Success]]'' (released in 1957), a co-production between Hecht-Hill-Lancaster and Curtis' own company Curtleigh Productions (co-owned with his wife, [[Janet Leigh]]). In 1956 Lancaster and Hecht entered the music industry with the companies [[Hecht-Lancaster & Buzzell Music]] and [[Calyork Music]].<ref>[http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Billboard/50s/1957/Billboard%201957-03-16.pdf \"Buzzell Ties with Hecht & Lancaster\", ''Billboard'', March 16 1957, p8]</ref>\n\nHecht-Hill-Lancaster produced seven additional films in the late 1950s; four starring Lancaster; ''[[Run Silent, Run Deep (1958 film)|Run Silent, Run Deep]]'' (1958), ''[[Separate Tables (film)|Separate Tables]]'' (1958), ''[[The Devil's Disciple]]'' (1959) and ''[[The Unforgiven (1960 film)|The Unforgiven]]'' (1960), and three without Lancaster: ''[[The Bachelor Party]]'' (1956), ''[[Take a Giant Step]]'' (1959) and ''[[Summer of the Seventeenth Doll]]'' (1960). Additionally Hecht-Hill-Lancaster served as the production company for the 1960-1961 TV series ''[[Whiplash (TV series)|Whiplash]]''. The \"H-H-L\" team impressed Hollywood with its success; as ''Life'' wrote in 1957, \"[a]fter the independent production of a baker's dozen of pictures, it has yet to have its first flop ... (They were also good pictures.).\" <ref name=\"hodgins19570610\">Hodgins, Eric.

Moscow, USSR, 1978.]]\nThe Hecht-Hill-Lancaster Productions company dissolved in 1960, after Hill ruptured his relation with both Hecht and Lancaster. Hill went on to produce a single additional film, ''[[The Happy Thieves]]'', in a new production company, Hillworth Productions, co-owned with his wife [[Rita Hayworth]]. Hecht and Lancaster worked on two more films together: ''[[The Young Savages]]'', released in 1961, and ''[[Birdman of Alcatraz (film)|Birdman of Alcatraz]]'', released in 1962 through Norma Productions as the production company's final film. Hecht went on to produce five films without Lancaster's assistance, through his company Harold Hecht Films Productions between 1961 and 1967, including another Academy Award winner, ''[[Cat Ballou]]'', starring [[Lee Marvin]] and [[Jane Fonda]]. Lancaster and Hecht would reunite twelve years after ''Birdman of Alcatraz'' for what ended up being Hecht's final film, ''[[Ulzana's Raid]]'', in 1972.\n\nIn 1967, Lancaster formed a new partnership with [[Roland Kibbee]], who had already worked as a writer on five Lancaster projects; ''Ten Tall Men'', ''The Crimson Pirate'', ''[[Three Sailors and a Girl]]'' (in which Lancaster made a cameo appearance), ''Vera Cruz'' and ''The Devil's Disciple''. Through Norlan Productions, Lancaster and Kibbee produced ''[[The Scalphunters]]'' in 1968, ''[[Valdez Is Coming]]'' in 1971 (which was also written by Kibbee) and ''[[The Midnight Man (1974 film)|The Midnight Man]]'' in 1974. ''The Midnight Man'' was written, produced and directed by both Kibbee and Lancaster, and would be the actor's final film as a producer.<ref>Buford 2008, pp. 138, 354.</ref> In his career, Lancaster produced twenty-three films, directed two and wrote for one.\n\n===Frequent collaborators===\n[[File:Judgment at Nuremberg-Burt Lancaster 2.jpg|thumb|In ''[[Judgment at Nuremberg]]'' (1961)]]\n\nLancaster appeared in a total of 17 films produced by his agent [[Harold Hecht]]. Eight of these were co-produced by [[James Hill (producer)|James Hill]]. He also appeared in eight films produced by [[Hal B. Wallis]] and two with producer [[Mark Hellinger]]. Although Lancaster's work alongside Kirk Douglas was mostly known as a successful pair of actors, Douglas in fact produced four films for the pair, through his production companies Bryna Productions and Joel Productions. Roland Kibbee also produced three Lancaster films. Lancaster was also cast in two [[Stanley Kramer]] productions.\n\n[[John Frankenheimer]] directed five films with Lancaster: ''[[The Young Savages]]'' (1961), ''Birdman of Alcatraz'' (1962), ''[[Seven Days in May]]'' (1964), ''[[The Train (1964 film)|The Train]]'' (1964), and ''[[The Gypsy Moths]]'' (1969). He was directed four times by [[Robert Aldrich]], three times by [[Robert Siodmak]] and [[Sydney Pollack]], and twice by [[Byron Haskin]], [[Daniel Mann]], [[John Sturges]], [[John Huston]], [[Richard Brooks]], [[Alexander Mackendrick]], [[Luchino Visconti]], and [[Michael Winner]].\n\n[[Roland Kibbee]] wrote for seven Lancaster films. Lancaster used make-up veteran Robert Schiffer in 20 credited films, hiring Schiffer on nearly all the films he produced.\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Bill Lancaster 1967.JPG|thumb|left|Lancaster's son [[Bill Lancaster|Bill]] in ''[[The Big Valley]]'' (1967)]]\n\n===Marriages and relationships===\nLancaster vigorously guarded his private life. He was married three times. His first two marriages, to June Ernst from 1935 to 1946 and Norma Anderson from 1946 to 1969, ended in divorce. His third marriage, to Susan Martin, lasted from September 1990 until his death in 1994. All five of his children were with Anderson: [[Bill Lancaster|Bill]] (who became an actor and screenwriter), James, Susan, Joanna, and Sighle (pronounced \"Sheila\"). Friends say he claimed he was romantically involved with [[Deborah Kerr]] during the filming of ''From Here to Eternity'' in 1953.<ref>Buford 2008, pp. 127\u201330.</ref> However, Kerr stated that while there was a spark of attraction, nothing ever happened.

However, he still managed to continue acting. In 1988, Lancaster was well enough to attend a Congressional hearing with old colleagues such as [[James Stewart]] and [[Ginger Rogers]] to protest against media magnate [[Ted Turner]]'s plan to [[colorize]] various black-and-white films from the 1930s and 1940s.\n\nLancaster's acting career ended after he suffered a stroke on November 30, 1990, which left him partly [[paralysis|paralyzed]] and largely unable to speak.

They spoke an exclusive dialect, Baltic German.

Up until early 20th century \"Latvian\" and \"Lithuanian\" could be used to mean the entire language family.<ref>Bojt\u00e1r page 11.</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\nThe Balts or Baltic peoples, defined as speakers of one of the [[Baltic languages]], a branch of the Indo-European language family, are descended from a group of Indo-European tribes who settled the area between the lower [[Vistula]] and southeast shore of the [[Baltic Sea]] and upper [[Daugava]] and [[Dnieper]] rivers. Because the thousands of lakes and swamps in this area contributed to the Balts' geographical isolation, the Baltic languages retain a number of conservative or archaic features.\n\nIt is possible{{according to whom|date=February 2014}} that around 3,500\u20132,500 B.C., there was massive migration of peoples representing the [[Corded Ware culture]]. They came from the southeast and spread all across Eastern and Central Europe, reaching even southern Finland. It is believed{{by whom|date=February 2014}} that Corded Ware culture peoples were [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] ancestors of many Europeans, including Balts. It is thought{{by whom|date=February 2014}} that those Indo-European newcomers were quite numerous and in the Eastern Baltic assimilated earlier indigenous cultures (Europidic cultures such as the [[Narva culture]] and [[Neman culture]]). Over time the new people formed the Baltic peoples and they spread in the area from the Baltic sea in the west to the [[Volga]] in the east.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nSome of the major authorities on Balts, such as [[Kazimieras B\u016bga]], [[Max Vasmer]], [[Vladimir Toporov]] and [[Oleg Trubachyov]],{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} in conducting etymological studies of eastern European river names, were able to identify in certain regions names of specifically Baltic provenance, which most likely indicate where the Balts lived in prehistoric times. This information is summarized and synthesized by [[Marija Gimbutas]] in ''The Balts'' (1963) to obtain a likely proto-Baltic homeland. Its borders are approximately: from a line on the [[Pomerania]]n coast eastward to include or nearly include the present-day sites of [[Berlin]], [[Warsaw]], [[Kiev]], and [[Kursk]], northward through [[Moscow]] to the River Berzha, westward in an irregular line to the coast of the [[Gulf of Riga]], north of [[Riga]].\n\n===Proto-history===\nA possible early reference to a Baltic people occurs in 98 CE, when [[Tacitus]] names a tribe living near the Baltic Sea (''Mare Svebicum'') as the [[Aesti]] (''Aestiorum gentes'') and describes them as [[amber]] gatherers. However, it is not clear if the Aesti mentioned by Tacitus were: (1) a (now-extinct) Baltic people (possibly synonymous with the [[Old Prussians|Brus/Pr\u016bsa]]), or; (2) a [[Finno-Ugric people]] (e.g. modern [[Estonians]]). The Aesti appear to have inhabited the [[Sambia (Baltic)|Sambian]] peninsula (in or near the present [[Kaliningrad Oblast]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nOver time, the area of Baltic habitation shrank, due to assimilation by other groups, and invasions. According to one of the theories which has gained considerable traction over the years, one of the western Baltic tribes, the [[Galindians]], [[Galindae]], or Goliad, migrated to the Eastern end of Baltic realm around the 4th century CE, and settled around modern day Moscow, Russia.<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/37147068/%D0%91%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%82%D1%8B_%D0%B2_%D0%BC%D0%B8%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%86%D0%B8%D1%8F%D1%85_%D0%92%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE_%D0%BF%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8F_%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%B2._%D0%93%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B4%D1%8B_%D0%98%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D1%84%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BC%D0%B0%D1%82_3-4_2017._%D0%A1._95-124 Tarasov I.

The eastern Baltic region was inhabited by ancestors of the Western Balts: [[Old Prussians|Brus/Pr\u016bsa]] (\"Old Prussians\"), [[Sudovians]]/[[Jotvingians]], [[Scalvians]], [[Nadruvians]], and [[Curonians]]. The Eastern Balts, including the hypothesised [[Dniepr Balts]], were living in modern-day Belarus, Ukraine and Russia.\n\nSubsequent [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] and [[Goths|Gothic]] domination in the first half of the first millennium CE in Northern and Eastern Europe, as well as later Slavic expansion, caused large migrations of the Balts \u2014 first, the [[Galindae]] or [[Galindians]] towards the east, and later, Eastern Balts towards the west \u2014 until, in the 13th and 14th centuries, they reached the general area that the present-day Balts inhabit. Many other Eastern and Southern Balts either assimilated with other Balts, or Slavs in the 4th\u20137th centuries and were gradually slavicized.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\n===Middle Ages===\nIn the 12th and the 13th centuries, internal struggles, as well as invasions by [[Ruthenians]] and [[Poles]] and later the expansion of the [[Teutonic Order]] resulted in an almost complete annihilation of the Galindians, Curonians, and Yotvingians.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} Gradually Old Prussians became [[Germanization|Germanized]] or some Lithuanized during period from the 15th to the 17th centuries, especially after the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] in [[Prussia]].{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} The cultures of the Lithuanians and Latgalians/Latvians survived and became the ancestors of the populations of the modern countries of [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]].\n\nOld Prussian was closely related to the other extinct Western [[Baltic language]]s, [[Curonian language|Curonian]], [[Galindian language|Galindian]] and [[Sudovian language|Sudovian]]. It is more distantly related to the surviving Eastern [[Baltic language]]s, [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] and [[Latvian language|Latvian]].

interval timecode|VITC]]) is a [[human-readable]] on-screen version of the [[timecode]] information for a piece of material superimposed on a video image. BITC is sometimes used in conjunction with \"real\" machine-readable timecode, but more often used in copies of original material on to a non-broadcast format such as VHS, so that the VHS copies can be traced back to their master tape and the original time codes easily located. \n\nMany professional [[VTR]]s can \"burn\" (overlay) the tape timecode onto one of their outputs. This output (which usually also displays the setup menu or [[on-screen display]]) is known as the ''super out'' or ''monitor out''. The ''character'' switch or menu item turns this behaviour on or off. The ''character'' function is also used to display the timecode on the preview monitors in [[linear video editing|linear editing]] suites.\n\nVideotapes that are recorded with timecode numbers overlaid on the video are referred to as ''window dubs'', named after the \"window\" that displays the burnt-in timecode on-screen.\n\nWhen editing was done using magnetic tapes that were subject to damage from excessive wear, it was common to use a window dub as a working copy for the majority of the editing process.  Editing decisions would be made using a window dub, and no specialized equipment was needed to write down an [[edit decision list]] which would then be replicated from the high-quality masters.\n\nTimecode can also be superimposed on video using a dedicated overlay device, often called a \"window dub inserter\".  This inputs a video signal and its separate timecode audio signal, reads the timecode, superimposes the timecode display over the video, and outputs the combined display (usually via composite), all in real time.  Stand-alone timecode generator / readers often have the window dub function built-in.  \n\nSome consumer cameras, in particular DV cameras, can \"burn\" (overlay) the tape timecode onto the composite output. This output typically is semi-transparent and may include other tape information. It is usually activated by turning on the 'display' info in one of the camera's sub-menus. While not as 'professional' as an overlay as created by a professional [[VCR]]s, it is a cheap alternative that is just as accurate.\n\nTimecode is stored in the metadata areas of captured DV AVI files, and some software is able to \"burn\" (overlay) this into the video frames. For example, DVMP Pro<ref>[http://www.dvmp.co.uk/dv-media-player-pro.htm DVMP Pro] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629090029/http://www.dvmp.co.uk/dv-media-player-pro.htm |date=June 29, 2007 }} - Software for burning in timecode and other items of metadata for DV AVI files.</ref> is able to \"burn\" timecode or other items of DV metadata (such as date and time, iris, shutter speed, gain, white balance mode, etc.) into DV AVI files.\n\n[[Optical character recognition|OCR]] techniques can be used to read BITC in situations where other forms of timecode are not available.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Linear timecode]]\n*[[Vertical interval timecode]]\n*[[SMPTE time code]]\n*[[MIDI timecode]]\n*[[CTL timecode]]\n*[[AES/EBU|AES-EBU embedded timecode]]\n*[[Rewritable consumer timecode]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Burnt-In Timecode}}\n[[Category:Timecodes]]\n[[Category:Film and video technology]]", "sha1": "1da2b5fzelt7r1n2px4rohsqitqd7yh"}}, {"title": "Bra\u2013ket notation", "ns": "0", "id": "4542", "revision": {"id": "864655705", "parentid": "864655216", "timestamp": "2018-10-18T16:33:03Z", "contributor": {"username": "Cuzkatzimhut", "id": "2996924"}, "comment": "/* The unit operator */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Quantum mechanics|cTopic=Background}}\n\nIn [[quantum mechanics]], '''bra\u2013ket notation''' is a standard notation for describing [[quantum state]]s. It can also be used to denote abstract [[vector space|vectors]] and [[linear functional]]s in [[mathematics]]. \nThe notation uses [[angle bracket]]s (the \u27e8 and \u27e9 symbols) and a [[vertical bar]] (the | symbol), to denote the [[scalar product]] of vectors or the action of a linear functional on a vector in a complex vector space.  The scalar product or action is written as\n\n:<math>\\langle\\phi{\\mid}\\psi\\rangle.</math>\n\nThe right part is called the '''ket''' {{IPAc-en|k|\u025b|t}}; it is a [[vector space|vector]], typically represented as a [[column vector]] and written \n\n:<math>|\\psi\\rangle.</math>\n\nThe left part is called the '''bra''', {{IPAc-en|b|r|\u0251\u02d0}}; it is the [[Hermitian conjugate]] of the ket with the same label, typically represented as a [[row vector]] and is written\n\n:<math>\\langle\\phi|.</math>\n\nA combination of bras, kets, and operators is interpreted using [[matrix multiplication]]. A bra and a ket with the same label are [[Hermitian conjugate]]s of each other.\n\nBra-ket notation was introduced in 1939 by [[Paul Dirac]]<ref name=\"Dirac\">{{harvnb|Dirac|1939}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Shankar|1994|loc=Chapter 1}}</ref> and is also known as the '''Dirac notation'''.  \n\nThe bra-ket notation has a precursor in [[Hermann Grassmann]]'s use of the notation\n<math>[\\phi{\\mid}\\psi]</math>\nfor his inner products nearly 100 years earlier.<ref name=\"Grassmann\">{{harvnb|Grassmann|1862}}</ref>\n\n==Introduction==\nBra\u2013ket notation is a notation for [[linear algebra]], particularly focused on vectors, [[inner product]]s, [[linear operator]]s, [[Hermitian conjugation]], and the [[dual space]], for both finite-dimensional and infinite-dimensional [[complex vector space]]s. It is specifically designed to ease the types of calculations that frequently come up in [[quantum mechanics]].\n\nIts use in quantum mechanics is quite widespread. Many phenomena that are explained using quantum mechanics are usually explained using bra\u2013ket notation.\n\nIn simple cases, a ket {{math|{{ket|''m''}}}} can be described as a [[column vector]], a bra with the same label {{math|{{bra|''m''}}}} is its [[conjugate transpose]] (which is a row vector), and writing bras, kets, and linear operators next to each other implies [[matrix multiplication]].<ref name=\"Bra-Ket Notation Trivializes Matrix Multiplication\">[http://algassert.com/post/1629 Gidney, Craig (2017). Bra\u2013Ket Notation Trivializes Matrix Multiplication]</ref> However, kets may also exist in uncountably-infinite-dimensional vector spaces, such that they cannot be literally written as a column vector. Also, writing a column vector as a list of numbers requires picking a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]], whereas one can write \"{{math|{{ket|''m''}}}}\" without committing to any particular basis. This is helpful because quantum mechanics calculations involve frequently switching between different bases (e.g. position basis, momentum basis, energy eigenbasis, etc.), so it is better to have the basis vectors (if any) written out explicitly.  In some situations involving two important basis vectors they will be referred to simply as \"{{math|{{ket|''-''}}}}\" and \"{{math|{{ket|''+''}}}}\".\n\nThe standard mathematical notation for the [[inner product]], preferred as well by some physicists, expresses exactly the same thing as the bra\u2013ket notation,\n\n:<math>(\\phi,\\psi) = \\langle\\phi{\\mid}\\psi\\rangle = \\bigl(\\langle\\phi|\\bigr) \\,  \\bigl(|\\psi\\rangle\\bigr),</math>\n\nBras and kets can also be configured in other ways, such as the [[outer product]]\n\n:<math>|\\psi\\rangle\\langle\\phi|</math>\n\nwhich can also be represented as a matrix multiplication (i.e., a column vector times a row vector equals a matrix).\n\nIf the ket is an element of a vector space, the bra is technically an element of its [[dual space]]\u2014see [[Riesz representation theorem]].\n\n==Vector spaces==\n\n===Vectors vs kets===\n\nIn mathematics, the term \"vector\" is used to refer generally to any element of any vector space. In physics, however, the term \"vector\" is much more specific: \"Vector\" refers almost exclusively to quantities like [[displacement (vector)|displacement]] or [[velocity]], which have three components that relate directly to the three dimensions of the real world. Such vectors are typically denoted with over arrows ({{math|{{vec|''r''}}}}) or boldface ({{math|'''r'''}}).\n\nIn quantum mechanics, a [[quantum state]] is typically represented as an element of an abstract complex vector space\u2014for example the infinite-dimensional vector space of all possible [[wavefunction]]s (functions mapping each point of 3D space to a complex number). Since the term \"vector\" is already used for something else (see previous paragraph), it is very common to refer to these elements of abstract complex vector spaces as \"kets\", and to write them using ket notation.\n\n===Ket notation===\n\nKet notation, invented by Dirac, uses vertical bars and angular brackets: {{math|{{ket|''A''}}}}. When this notation is used, these quantities are called \"kets\", and {{math|{{ket|''A''}}}} is read as \"ket-A\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Quantum Mechanics Demystified |first=D. |last=McMahon |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=2006 |isbn=0-07-145546-9}}</ref> These kets can be manipulated using the usual rules of linear algebra, for example:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n|A \\rangle &= |B\\rangle + |C\\rangle \\\\\n|C \\rangle &= (-1+2i)|D \\rangle \\\\\n|D \\rangle &= \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-x^2} |x\\rangle \\, \\mathrm{d}x \\,.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nNote how any symbols, letters, numbers, or even words\u2014whatever serves as a convenient label\u2014can be used as the label inside a ket. For example, the last line above involves infinitely many different kets, one for each real number {{math|''x''}}. In other words, the symbol \"{{math|{{ket|''A''}}}}\" has a specific and universal mathematical meaning, while just the \"{{math|''A''}}\" by itself does not. For example, {{math|{{ket|1}} + {{ket|2}}}} might or might not be equal to {{math|{{ket|3}}}}. Nevertheless, for convenience, there is usually some logical scheme behind the labels inside kets, such as the common practice of labeling [[stationary state|energy eigenkets]] in quantum mechanics through a listing of their [[quantum number]]s.\n\n===Inner products and bras===\n{{main article|Inner product}}\nAn [[inner product]] is a generalization of the [[dot product]]. The inner product of two vectors is a scalar. In neutral notation (notation dedicated to the inner product ''only''), this might be written {{math|(''A'', ''B'')}}, where {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''B''}} are elements of the abstract vector space, i.e. both are ''kets''.\n\nBra\u2013ket notation uses a specific notation for inner products:\n\n:<math> (A, B) = \\langle A | B \\rangle = \\text{the inner product of ket } | A \\rangle \\text{ with ket } | B \\rangle</math>\n\nBra\u2013ket notation splits this inner product (also called a \"bracket\") into two pieces, the \"bra\" and the \"ket\":\n\n:<math> \\langle A | B \\rangle = \\bigl( \\langle A | \\bigr) \\, \\bigl( | B \\rangle \\bigr)</math>\n\nwhere {{math|{{bra|''A''}}}} is called a bra, read as \"bra-A\", and {{math|{{ket|''B''}}}} is a ket as above.\n\nThe purpose of \"splitting\" the inner product into a bra and a ket is that ''both'' the bra {{math|{{bra|''A''}}}} and the ket {{math|{{ket|''B''}}}} are meaningful ''on their own'', and can be used in other contexts besides within an inner product. There are two main ways to think about the meanings of separate bras and kets. Accordingly, the interpretation of the expression {{math|{{bra-ket|''A''|''B''}}}} has a second interpretation, namely that of the action of a [[linear functional]] per below.\n\n====Bras and kets as row and column vectors====\nFor a finite-dimensional vector space, using a fixed [[orthonormal basis]], the inner product can be written as a [[matrix multiplication]] of a row vector with a column vector:\n:<math> \\langle A | B \\rangle \\doteq A_1^* B_1 + A_2^* B_2 + \\cdots + A_N^* B_N =\n\\begin{pmatrix} A_1^* & A_2^* & \\cdots & A_N^* \\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix} B_1 \\\\ B_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ B_N \\end{pmatrix}</math>\nBased on this, the bras and kets can be defined as:\n:<math>\\begin{align} \\langle A | &\\doteq \\begin{pmatrix} A_1^* & A_2^* & \\cdots & A_N^* \\end{pmatrix} \\\\\n| B \\rangle &\\doteq \\begin{pmatrix} B_1 \\\\ B_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ B_N \\end{pmatrix} \\end{align}</math>\nand then it is understood that a bra next to a ket implies [[matrix multiplication]].\n\nThe [[conjugate transpose]] (also called ''Hermitian conjugate'') of a bra is the corresponding ket and vice versa:\n:<math>\\langle A |^\\dagger = |A \\rangle, \\quad |A \\rangle^\\dagger = \\langle A |</math>\nbecause if one starts with the bra\n:<math>\\begin{pmatrix} A_1^* & A_2^* & \\cdots & A_N^* \\end{pmatrix} \\,,</math>\nthen performs a [[complex conjugation]], and then a [[matrix transpose]], one ends up with the ket\n:<math>\\begin{pmatrix} A_1 \\\\ A_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ A_N \\end{pmatrix}</math>\n\n====Bras as linear functionals====\n{{main article|Dual space|Riesz representation theorem}}\nA more abstract definition, which is equivalent but more easily generalized to infinite-dimensional spaces, is to say that bras are [[linear functional]]s on the space of kets, i.e. linear transformations that input a ket and output a complex number. The bra linear functionals are defined to be consistent with the inner product. Thus, if {{math|{{bra|''A''}}}} is the linear functional corresponding to {{math|{{ket|''A''}}}} under the [[Riesz representation theorem]], then\n\n:<math>\\langle A | B \\rangle = \\langle A|\\bigl(|B\\rangle\\bigr)\\,,</math>\n\ni.e. it produces ''the same'' complex number as the inner product does. The terminology for the right hand side is though ''not'' inner product, which always involves two ''kets''. Confusing this is harmless, since the same number is produced in the end.\n\nIn mathematics terminology, the [[vector space]] of bras is the [[dual space]] to the vector space of kets, and corresponding bras and kets are related by the [[Riesz representation theorem]].\n\n=== Non-normalizable states and non-Hilbert spaces ===\n\nBra\u2013ket notation can be used even if the vector space is not a [[Hilbert space]].\n\nIn quantum mechanics, it is common practice to write down kets which have infinite [[norm (mathematics)|norm]], i.e. non-[[normalizable wavefunction]]s. Examples include states whose [[wavefunction]]s are [[Dirac delta function]]s or infinite [[plane wave]]s. These do not, technically, belong to the [[Hilbert space]] itself. However, the definition of \"Hilbert space\" can be broadened to accommodate these states (see the [[Gelfand\u2013Naimark\u2013Segal construction]] or [[rigged Hilbert space]]s). The bra\u2013ket notation continues to work in an analogous way in this broader context.\n\n[[Banach space]]s are a different generalization of Hilbert spaces. In a Banach space {{math|{{mathcal|B}}}}, the vectors may be notated by kets and the continuous [[linear functional]]s by bras. Over any vector space without [[topology]], we may also notate the vectors by kets and the linear functionals by bras. In these more general contexts, the bracket does not have the meaning of an inner product, because the Riesz representation theorem does not apply.\n\n==Usage in quantum mechanics==\n\nThe mathematical structure of [[quantum mechanics]] is based in large part on [[linear algebra]]:\n*[[Wave function]]s and other [[quantum state]]s can be represented as vectors in a complex [[Hilbert space]]. (The exact structure of this Hilbert space depends on the situation.) In bra\u2013ket notation, for example, an electron might be in the \"state\" {{math|{{ket|''\u03c8''}}}}. (Technically, the quantum states are ''[[ray (geometry)|ray]]s'' of vectors in the Hilbert space, as {{math|''c''{{ket|''\u03c8''}}}} corresponds to the same state for any nonzero complex number {{math|''c''}}.)\n*[[Quantum superposition]]s can be described as vector sums of the constituent states. For example, an electron in the state {{math|{{ket|1}} + ''i'' {{ket|2}}}} is in a quantum superposition of the states {{math|{{ket|1}}}} and {{math|{{ket|2}}}}.\n*[[Measurement in quantum mechanics|Measurements]] are associated with [[linear operator]]s (called [[observable]]s) on the Hilbert space of quantum states.\n*Dynamics are also described by linear operators on the Hilbert space. For example, in the [[Schr\u00f6dinger picture]], there is a linear [[time evolution]] operator {{math|''U''}} with the property that if an electron is in state {{math|{{ket|''\u03c8''}}}} right now, at a later time it will be in the state {{math|''U''{{ket|''\u03c8''}}}}, the same {{math|''U''}} for every possible {{math|{{ket|''\u03c8''}}}}.\n*[[Normalizable wave function|Wave function normalization]] is scaling a wave function so that its [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] is 1.\n\nSince virtually every calculation in quantum mechanics involves vectors and linear operators, it can involve, and often does involve, bra\u2013ket notation. A few examples follow:\n\n===Spinless position\u2013space wave function===\n  {{multiple image\n   | left\n   | footer    = Components of complex vectors plotted against index number; discrete {{math|''k''}} and continuous {{math|''x''}}.

This label is the eigenvalue of the position operator acting on such a basis state, <math> \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}|\\mathbf{r}\\rangle =   \\mathbf{r}|\\mathbf{r}\\rangle </math>.  Since there are an [[uncountably infinite]] number of vector components in the basis, this is an uncountably infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. The dimensions of the Hilbert space (usually infinite) and position space (usually 1, 2 or 3) are not to be conflated.\n\nStarting from any ket {{math|{{ket|\u03a8}}}} in this Hilbert space,  one may ''define'' a complex scalar function of {{math|'''r'''}}, known as a [[wavefunction]],\n:<math>\\Psi(\\mathbf{r}) \\ \\stackrel{\\text{def}}{=}\\ \\lang \\mathbf{r}|\\Psi\\rang \\,.</math>\n\nOn the left-hand side, {{math|\u03a8('''r''')}} is a function mapping any point in space to a complex number; on the right-hand side, {{math|{{ket|\u03a8}} {{=}} \u222b d<sup>3</sup>'''r''' \u03a8('''r''') {{ket|'''r'''}}}} is a ket consisting of a superposition of kets with relative coefficients specified by that function.\n\nIt is then customary to define linear operators acting on wavefunctions in terms of linear operators acting on kets, by\n:<math>A \\Psi(\\mathbf{r}) \\ \\stackrel{\\text{def}}{=}\\ \\lang \\mathbf{r}|A|\\Psi\\rang \\,.</math>\n\nFor instance, the [[momentum]] operator {{math|'''p'''}} has the following form,\n:<math>\\mathbf{p} \\Psi(\\mathbf{r}) \\ \\stackrel{\\text{def}}{=}\\ \\lang \\mathbf{r} |\\mathbf{p}|\\Psi\\rang = - i \\hbar \\nabla \\Psi(\\mathbf{r}) \\,.</math>\n\nOne occasionally encounters an expression such as\n:<math>\\nabla |\\Psi\\rang \\,,</math>\nthough this is something of an [[abuse of notation]]. The differential operator must be understood to be an abstract operator, acting on kets, that has the effect of differentiating wavefunctions once the expression is projected into the position basis,\n:<math>\\nabla \\lang\\mathbf{r}|\\Psi\\rang \\,,</math>\neven though, in the momentum basis, the operator amounts to a mere multiplication operator (by {{math|''i\u0127'''''p'''}}).\n\n===Overlap of states===\nIn quantum mechanics the expression {{math|{{bra-ket|''\u03c6''|''\u03c8''}}}} is typically interpreted as the [[probability amplitude]] for the state {{math|''\u03c8''}} to [[wavefunction collapse|collapse]] into the state {{math|''\u03c6''}}. Mathematically, this means the coefficient for the projection of {{math|''\u03c8''}} onto {{math|''\u03c6''}}.  It is also described as the projection of state {{math|''\u03c8''}} onto state {{math|''\u03c6''}}.\n\n===Changing basis for a spin-{{sfrac|1|2}} particle===\nA stationary [[spin-\u00bd|spin-{{sfrac|1|2}}]] particle has a two-dimensional Hilbert space. One [[orthonormal basis]] is:\n:<math>|{\\uparrow}_z \\rangle \\,, \\; |{\\downarrow}_z \\rangle</math>\nwhere {{math|{{ket|\u2191<sub>''z''</sub>}}}} is the state with a definite value of the [[angular momentum operator|spin operator {{math|''S<sub>z</sub>''}}]] equal to +{{sfrac|1|2}} and  {{math|{{ket|\u2193<sub>''z''</sub>}}}} is the state with a definite value of the [[angular momentum operator|spin operator {{math|''S<sub>z</sub>''}}]] equal to \u2212{{sfrac|1|2}}.\n\nSince these are a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]], ''any'' [[quantum state]] of the particle can be expressed as a [[linear combination]] (i.e., [[quantum superposition]]) of these two states:\n:<math>|\\psi \\rangle = a_{\\psi} |{\\uparrow}_z \\rangle + b_{\\psi} |{\\downarrow}_z \\rangle</math>\nwhere {{math|''a<sub>\u03c8</sub>''}} and {{math|''b<sub>\u03c8</sub>''}} are complex numbers.\n\nA ''different'' basis for the same Hilbert space is:\n:<math>|{\\uparrow}_x \\rangle \\,, \\; |{\\downarrow}_x \\rangle</math>\ndefined in terms of {{math|''S<sub>x</sub>''}} rather than {{math|''S<sub>z</sub>''}}.\n\nAgain, ''any'' state of the particle can be expressed as a linear combination of these two:\n:<math>|\\psi \\rangle = c_{\\psi} |{\\uparrow}_x \\rangle + d_{\\psi} |{\\downarrow}_x \\rangle</math>\n\nIn vector form, you might write\n:<math>|\\psi\\rangle \\doteq \\begin{pmatrix} a_\\psi \\\\ b_\\psi \\end{pmatrix} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad |\\psi\\rangle \\doteq \\begin{pmatrix} c_\\psi \\\\ d_\\psi \\end{pmatrix} </math>\ndepending on which basis you are using. In other words, the \"coordinates\" of a vector depend on the basis used.\n\nThere is a mathematical relationship between {{math|''a''<sub>\u03c8</sub>}}, {{math|''b''<sub>\u03c8</sub>}}, {{math|''c''<sub>\u03c8</sub>}} and {{math|''d''<sub>\u03c8</sub>}}; see [[change of basis]].\n\n===Misleading uses===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}\n\nThere are a few conventions and abuses of notation that are generally accepted by the physics community, but which might confuse the non-initiated.\n\nIt is common to use the same symbol for ''labels'' and ''constants'' in the same equation. For example, {{math|''\u03b1\u0302'' {{ket|''\u03b1''}} {{=}} ''\u03b1'' {{ket|''\u03b1''}}}}, where the symbol {{math|''\u03b1''}} is used '''simultaneously''' as the ''name of the operator'' {{math|''\u03b1\u0302''}}, its ''eigenvector'' {{math|{{ket|''\u03b1''}}}} and the associated ''eigenvalue'' {{math|''\u03b1''}}.\n\nSomething similar occurs in component notation of vectors. While {{math|''\u03a8''}} (uppercase) is traditionally associated with wavefunctions, {{math|''\u03c8''}} (lowercase) may be used to denote a ''label'', a ''wave function'' or ''complex constant'' in the same context, usually differentiated only by a subscript.\n\nThe main abuses are including operations inside the vector labels. This is done for a fast notation of scaling vectors. E.g. if the vector {{math|{{ket|''\u03b1''}}}} is scaled by {{sqrt|2}}, it might be denoted by {{math|{{ket|''\u03b1''/{{sqrt|2}}}}}}, which makes no sense since {{math|''\u03b1''}} is a label, not a function or a number, so you can't perform operations on it.\n\nThis is especially common when denoting vectors as tensor products, where part of the labels are moved '''outside''' the designed slot, e.g. {{math|{{ket|''\u03b1''}} {{=}} {{ket|''\u03b1''/{{sqrt|2}}<sub>1</sub>}} \u2297 {{ket|''\u03b1''/{{sqrt|2}}<sub>2</sub>}}}}. Here part of the labeling that should state that all three vectors are different was moved outside the kets, as subscripts 1 and 2. And a further abuse occurs, since {{math|''\u03b1''}} is meant to refer to the norm of the first vector\u2014which is a ''label'' denoting a ''value''.\n\n==Linear operators==\n{{see also|Linear operator}}\n\n===Linear operators acting on kets===\n\nA [[linear operator]] is a map that inputs a ket and outputs a ket. (In order to be called \"linear\", it is required to have [[linear operator|certain properties]].) In other words, if {{math|'''''A'''''}} is a linear operator and {{math|{{ket|''\u03c8''}}}} is a ket, then {{math|'''''A'''''{{ket|''\u03c8''}}}} is another ket.\n\nIn an {{math|''N''}}-dimensional Hilbert space, {{math|{{ket|''\u03c8''}}}} can be written as an {{math|''N'' \u00d7 1}} [[column vector]], and then {{math|'''''A'''''}} is an {{math|''N'' \u00d7 ''N''}} matrix with complex entries. The ket {{math|'''''A'''''{{ket|''\u03c8''}}}} can be computed by normal [[matrix multiplication]].\n\nLinear operators are ubiquitous in the theory of quantum mechanics. For example, observable physical quantities are represented by [[self-adjoint operator]]s, such as [[energy]] or [[momentum]], whereas transformative processes are represented by [[unitary operator|unitary]] linear operators such as rotation or the progression of time.\n\n===Linear operators acting on bras===\n\nOperators can also be viewed as acting on bras ''from the right hand side''. Specifically, if {{math|'''''A'''''}} is a linear operator and {{math|{{bra|''\u03c6''}}}} is a bra, then {{math|{{bra|''\u03c6''}}'''''A'''''}} is another bra defined by the rule\n\n:<math>\\bigl(\\langle\\phi|\\boldsymbol{A}\\bigr) |\\psi\\rangle = \\langle\\phi| \\bigl(\\boldsymbol{A}|\\psi\\rangle\\bigr) \\,,</math>\n\n(in other words, a [[function composition]]). This expression is commonly written as (cf. [[energy inner product]])\n\n:<math>\\langle\\phi|\\boldsymbol{A}|\\psi\\rangle \\,.</math>\n\nIn an {{math|''N''}}-dimensional Hilbert space, {{math|{{bra|''\u03c6''}}}} can be written as a {{math|1 \u00d7 ''N''}} [[row vector]], and {{math|'''''A'''''}} (as in the previous section) is an {{math|''N'' \u00d7 ''N''}} matrix. Then the bra {{math|{{bra|''\u03c6''}}'''''A'''''}} can be computed by normal [[matrix multiplication]].\n\nIf the same state vector appears on both bra and ket side,\n:<math>\\langle\\psi|\\boldsymbol{A}|\\psi\\rangle \\,,</math>\nthen this expression gives the [[expectation value (quantum mechanics)|expectation value]], or mean or average value, of the observable represented by operator {{math|'''''A'''''}} for the physical system in the state {{math|{{ket|''\u03c8''}}}}.\n\n===Outer products===\n\nA convenient way to define linear operators on a Hilbert space {{math|{{mathcal|H}}}} is given by the [[outer product]]: if {{math|{{bra|''\u03c6''}}}} is a bra and {{math|{{ket|''\u03c8''}}}} is a ket, the outer product\n:<math> |\\phi\\rang \\, \\lang \\psi| </math>\ndenotes the [[finite-rank operator|rank-one operator]] with the rule \n:<math> \\bigl(|\\phi\\rang \\lang \\psi|\\bigr)(x) = \\lang \\psi | x \\rang |\\phi \\rang</math>.\n\nFor a finite-dimensional vector space, the outer product can be understood as simple matrix multiplication:\n:<math> |\\phi \\rangle \\, \\langle \\psi | \\doteq \n\\begin{pmatrix} \\phi_1 \\\\ \\phi_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\phi_N \\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix} \\psi_1^* & \\psi_2^* & \\cdots & \\psi_N^* \\end{pmatrix}\n= \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\phi_1 \\psi_1^* & \\phi_1 \\psi_2^* & \\cdots & \\phi_1 \\psi_N^* \\\\\n\\phi_2 \\psi_1^* & \\phi_2 \\psi_2^* & \\cdots & \\phi_2 \\psi_N^* \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n\\phi_N \\psi_1^* & \\phi_N \\psi_2^* & \\cdots & \\phi_N \\psi_N^* \\end{pmatrix}\n</math>\nThe outer product is an {{math|''N'' \u00d7 ''N''}} matrix, as expected for a linear operator.\n\nOne of the uses of the outer product is to construct [[projection operator]]s. Given a ket {{math|{{ket|''\u03c8''}}}} of norm 1, the orthogonal projection onto the [[Linear subspace|subspace]] spanned by {{math|{{ket|''\u03c8''}}}} is\n:<math>|\\psi\\rangle \\, \\langle\\psi| \\,.</math>\n\n===Hermitian conjugate operator===\n{{main article|Hermitian conjugate}}\nJust as kets and bras can be transformed into each other (making {{math|{{ket|''\u03c8''}}}} into {{math|{{bra|''\u03c8''}}}}), the element from the dual space corresponding to {{math|''A''{{ket|''\u03c8''}}}} is {{math|{{bra|''\u03c8''}}''A''<sup>\u2020</sup>}},  where {{math|''A''<sup>\u2020</sup>}} denotes the [[Hermitian conjugate]] (or adjoint) of the operator {{math|''A''}}. In other words,\n:<math> |\\phi\\rangle = A |\\psi\\rangle \\quad \\text{if and only if} \\quad \\langle\\phi| = \\langle \\psi | A^\\dagger \\,.</math>\n\nIf {{math|''A''}} is expressed as an {{math|''N'' \u00d7 ''N''}} matrix, then {{math|''A''<sup>\u2020</sup>}} is its [[conjugate transpose]].\n\n[[Self-adjoint]] operators, where {{math|''A'' {{=}} ''A''<sup>\u2020</sup>}}, play an important role in quantum mechanics; for example, an [[observable]] is always described by a self-adjoint operator. If {{mvar|A}} is a self-adjoint operator, then {{math|{{bra|''\u03c8''}}''A''{{ket|''\u03c8''}}}} is always a real number (not complex). This implies that [[Expectation value (quantum mechanics)|expectation values]] of observables are real.\n\n==Properties==\nBra\u2013ket notation was designed to facilitate the formal manipulation of linear-algebraic expressions. Some of the properties that allow this manipulation are listed herein. In what follows, {{math|''c''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''c''<sub>2</sub>}} denote arbitrary [[complex number]]s, {{math|''c''*}} denotes the [[complex conjugate]] of {{math|''c''}}, {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''B''}} denote arbitrary linear operators, and these properties are to hold for any choice of bras and kets.\n\n===Linearity===\n* Since bras are linear functionals,\n\n::<math>\\langle\\phi| \\bigl( c_1|\\psi_1\\rangle + c_2|\\psi_2\\rangle \\bigr) = c_1\\langle\\phi|\\psi_1\\rangle + c_2\\langle\\phi|\\psi_2\\rangle \\,. </math>\n\n* By the definition of addition and scalar multiplication of linear functionals in the [[dual space]],<ref>[http://bohr.physics.berkeley.edu/classes/221/1112/notes/hilbert.pdf Lecture notes by Robert Littlejohn], eqns 12 and 13</ref>\n\n::<math>\\bigl(c_1 \\langle\\phi_1| + c_2 \\langle\\phi_2|\\bigr) |\\psi\\rangle = c_1 \\langle\\phi_1|\\psi\\rangle + c_2 \\langle\\phi_2|\\psi\\rangle \\,. </math>\n\n===Associativity===\nGiven any expression involving complex numbers, bras, kets, inner products, outer products, and/or linear operators (but not addition), written in bra\u2013ket notation, the parenthetical groupings do not matter (i.e., the [[associative property]] holds). For example:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\lang \\psi| \\bigl(A |\\phi\\rang\\bigr) = \\bigl(\\lang \\psi|A\\bigr)|\\phi\\rang \\, &\\stackrel{\\text{def}}{=} \\, \\lang \\psi | A | \\phi \\rang \\\\\n\\bigl(A|\\psi\\rang\\bigr)\\lang \\phi| = A\\bigl(|\\psi\\rang \\lang \\phi|\\bigr) \\, &\\stackrel{\\text{def}}{=} \\, A | \\psi \\rang \\lang \\phi |\n\\end{align}</math>\nand so forth. The expressions on the right (with no parentheses whatsoever) are allowed to be written unambiguously ''because'' of the equalities on the left. Note that the associative property does ''not'' hold for expressions that include nonlinear operators, such as the [[antilinear]] [[T-symmetry|time reversal operator]] in physics.\n\n===Hermitian conjugation===\nBra\u2013ket notation makes it particularly easy to compute the Hermitian conjugate (also called ''dagger'', and denoted {{math|\u2020}}) of expressions. The formal rules are:\n* The Hermitian conjugate of a bra is the corresponding ket, and vice versa.\n* The Hermitian conjugate of a complex number is its complex conjugate.\n* The Hermitian conjugate of the Hermitian conjugate of anything (linear operators, bras, kets, numbers) is itself\u2014i.e.,\n::<math>\\left(x^\\dagger\\right)^\\dagger=x \\,.</math>\n* Given any combination of complex numbers, bras, kets, inner products, outer products, and/or linear operators, written in bra\u2013ket notation, its Hermitian conjugate can be computed by reversing the order of the components, and taking the Hermitian conjugate of each.\n\nThese rules are sufficient to formally write the Hermitian conjugate of any such expression; some examples are as follows:\n* Kets:\n::<math>\n\\bigl(c_1|\\psi_1\\rangle + c_2|\\psi_2\\rangle\\bigr)^\\dagger = c_1^* \\langle\\psi_1| + c_2^* \\langle\\psi_2| \\,.\n</math>\n* Inner products:\n::<math>\\langle \\phi | \\psi \\rangle^* = \\langle \\psi|\\phi\\rangle \\,.</math>\n\n:Note that {{math|{{bra-ket|''\u03c6''|''\u03c8''}}}} is a scalar, so the Hermitian conjugate is just the complex conjugate, i.e.\n::<math>\\bigl(\\langle \\phi | \\psi \\rangle\\bigr)^\\dagger = \\langle \\phi | \\psi \\rangle^*</math>\n* Matrix elements:\n::<math>\\begin{align}\n\\langle \\phi| A | \\psi \\rangle^* &= \\left\\langle \\psi \\left| A^\\dagger \\right|\\phi \\right\\rangle \\\\\n\\left\\langle \\phi\\left| A^\\dagger B^\\dagger \\right| \\psi \\right\\rangle^* &= \\langle \\psi | BA |\\phi \\rangle \\,.\n\\end{align}</math>\n* Outer products:\n::<math>\\Big(\\bigl(c_1|\\phi_1\\rangle\\langle \\psi_1|\\bigr) + \\bigl(c_2|\\phi_2\\rangle\\langle\\psi_2|\\bigr)\\Big)^\\dagger = \\bigl(c_1^* |\\psi_1\\rangle\\langle \\phi_1|\\bigr) + \\bigl(c_2^*|\\psi_2\\rangle\\langle\\phi_2|\\bigr) \\,.</math>\n\n==Composite bras and kets==\nTwo Hilbert spaces {{math|''V''}} and {{math|''W''}} may form a third space {{math|''V'' \u2297 ''W''}} by a [[tensor product]]. In quantum mechanics, this is used for describing composite systems. If a system is composed of two subsystems described in {{math|''V''}} and {{math|''W''}} respectively, then the Hilbert space of the entire system is the tensor product of the two spaces. (The exception to this is if the subsystems are actually [[identical particles]]. In that case, the situation is a little more complicated.)\n\nIf {{math|{{ket|''\u03c8''}}}} is a ket in {{math|''V''}} and {{math|{{ket|''\u03c6''}}}} is a ket in {{math|''W''}}, the direct product of the two kets is a ket in {{math|''V'' \u2297 ''W''}}. This is written in various notations:\n:<math>|\\psi\\rangle|\\phi\\rangle \\,,\\quad |\\psi\\rangle \\otimes |\\phi\\rangle\\,,\\quad|\\psi \\phi\\rangle\\,,\\quad|\\psi ,\\phi\\rangle\\,.</math>\n\nSee [[quantum entanglement#Quantum mechanical framework|quantum entanglement]] and the [[EPR paradox#Mathematical formulation|EPR paradox]] for applications of this product.\n\n==The unit operator==\nConsider a complete [[orthonormal]] system (''[[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]]''),\n:<math>\\{ e_i \\ | \\ i \\in \\mathbb{N} \\} \\,,</math>\nfor a Hilbert space {{math|''H''}}, with respect to the norm from an inner product {{math|{{angbr|\u00b7,\u00b7}}}}. \n\nFrom basic [[functional analysis]], it is  known that any ket {{math|{{ket|''\u03c8''}}}} can also be written as\n:<math>|\\psi\\rangle = \\sum_{i \\in \\mathbb{N}} \\langle e_i | \\psi \\rangle | e_i \\rangle,</math>\nwith {{math|{{bra-ket|\u00b7|\u00b7}}}} the inner product on the Hilbert space.\n\nFrom the commutativity of kets with (complex) scalars, it follows that\n:<math>\\sum_{i \\in \\mathbb{N}} | e_i \\rangle \\langle e_i | = 1\\!\\! 1</math>\nmust be the ''identity operator'', which sends each vector to itself. \n\nThis, then,  can be inserted in any expression without affecting its value; for example\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\langle v | w \\rangle &= \\langle v | \\left( \\sum_{i \\in \\mathbb{N}} | e_i \\rangle \\langle e_i| \\right) | w \\rangle \\\\\n                      &= \\langle v | \\left( \\sum_{i \\in \\mathbb{N}} | e_i \\rangle \\langle e_i| \\right) \\left( \\sum_{j \\in \\mathbb{N}} | e_j \\rangle \\langle e_j |\\right)| w \\rangle \\\\\n&= \\langle v | e_i \\rangle \\langle e_i | e_j \\rangle \\langle e_j | w \\rangle \\,, \n\\end{align}</math>\nwhere, in the last identity, the [[Einstein summation convention]] has been used.\n\nIn [[quantum mechanics]], it often occurs that little or no information about the inner product {{math|{{bra-ket|''\u03c8''|''\u03c6''}}}} of two arbitrary (state) kets is present, while it is still possible to say something about the expansion coefficients {{math|{{bra-ket|''\u03c8''|''e<sub>i</sub>''}} {{=}} {{bra-ket|''e<sub>i</sub>''|''\u03c8''}}*}} and {{math|{{bra-ket|''e<sub>i</sub>''|''\u03c6''}}}} of those vectors with respect to a specific (orthonormalized) basis. In this case, it is particularly useful to insert the unit operator into the bracket one time or more.\n\nFor more information, see [[Resolution of the identity]], \n*   &nbsp; &nbsp; {{math|1 {{=}} \u222b d''x'' {{ket|''x''}}{{bra|''x''}} {{=}} \u222b d''p'' {{ket|''p''}}{{bra|''p''}}}},  where  {{math| {{ket|''p''}} {{=}} \u222b d''x'' ''e''<sup>''ixp''/''\u0127''</sup>{{ket|''x''}}/{{sqrt|2''\u03c0\u0127''}}}}.  \n\nSince {{math|{{bra-ket|''x''\u2032|''x''}} {{=}} ''\u03b4''(''x'' \u2212 ''x''\u2032)}}, plane waves follow, {{math|{{bra-ket|''x''|''p''}} {{=}} ''e''<sup>''ixp''/''\u0127''</sup>/{{sqrt|2''\u03c0\u0127''}}}}.<ref>In his book (1958), Ch. III.20, Dirac defines the ''standard ket'' which, up to a normalization,  is the translationally invariant momentum eigenstate <math>|\\varpi\\rangle=\\lim_{p\\to 0} |p\\rangle</math> in the momentum representation, i.e.,  <math>\\hat{p}|\\varpi\\rangle=0</math>. Consequently, the corresponding wavefunction is a constant,   <math> \\langle x|\\varpi\\rangle  \\sqrt{2\\pi \\hbar}=1</math>, and <math>|x\\rangle= \\delta(\\hat{x}-x) |\\varpi\\rangle  \\sqrt{2\\pi \\hbar}</math>. </ref>\n\nTypically, when all matrix elements of an operator such as \n:<math> \\langle x|   A |y\\rangle   </math>\nare available,\nthis resolution serves to reconstitute the full operator,\n:<math> \\int dx dy ~~ |x\\rangle \\langle x|   A |y\\rangle \\langle y | =  A ~.   </math>\n\n== Notation used by mathematicians ==\n\nThe object physicists are considering when using bra\u2013ket notation is a [[Hilbert space]] (a [[Complete metric space|complete]] [[inner product space]]).\n\nLet {{math|{{mathcal|H}}}} be a Hilbert space and {{math|''h'' \u2208 {{mathcal|H}}}} a vector in {{math|{{mathcal|H}}}}. What physicists would denote by {{math|{{ket|''h''}}}} is the vector itself. That is,\n\n:<math> |h\\rangle\\in \\mathcal{H} </math>.\n\nLet {{math|{{mathcal|H}}*}} be the [[dual space]] of {{math|{{mathcal|H}}}}. This is the space of linear functionals on {{math|{{mathcal|H}}}}. The isomorphism {{math|''\u03a6'' : {{mathcal|H}} \u2192 {{mathcal|H}}*}} is defined by {{math|''\u03a6''(''h'') {{=}} ''\u03c6<sub>h</sub>''}}, where for every {{math|''g'' \u2208 {{mathcal|H}}}} we define\n:<math> \\phi_h(g) = \\mbox{IP}(h,g) = (h,g) = \\langle h,g \\rangle = \\langle h|g \\rangle </math>,\nwhere {{math|IP(\u00b7,\u00b7)}}, {{math|(\u00b7,\u00b7)}}, {{math|{{angbr|\u00b7,\u00b7}}}} and {{math|{{bra-ket|\u00b7|\u00b7}}}} are just different notations for expressing an inner product between two elements in a Hilbert space (or for the first three, in any inner product space). Notational confusion arises when identifying {{math|''\u03c6<sub>h</sub>''}} and {{math|''g''}} with {{math|{{bra|''h''}}}} and {{math|{{ket|''g''}}}} respectively. This is because of literal symbolic substitutions. Let {{math|''\u03c6<sub>h</sub>'' {{=}} ''H'' {{=}} {{bra|''h''}}}} and let {{math|''g'' {{=}} G {{=}} {{ket|''g''}}}}. This gives\n\n:<math> \\phi_h(g) = H(g) = H(G)=\\langle h|(G) = \\langle h|\\bigl(|g\\rangle\\bigr) \\,. </math>\n\nOne ignores the parentheses and removes the double bars. Some properties of this notation are convenient since we are dealing with linear operators and composition acts like a [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]] multiplication.\n\nMoreover, mathematicians usually write the dual entity not at the first place, as the physicists do, but at the second one, and they usually use not an [[asterisk]] but an overline (which the physicists reserve for averages and the [[Dirac_equation#Conservation_of_probability_current|Dirac spinor adjoint]]) to denote [[complex conjugate]] numbers; i.e., for scalar products mathematicians usually write\n:<math>(\\phi ,\\psi )=\\int \\phi (x)\\cdot \\overline{\\psi(x)}\\, \\mathrm{d}x \\,,</math>\nwhereas physicists would write for the same quantity\n:<math> \\langle\\psi |\\phi \\rangle=\\int \\mathrm{d}x\\,\\psi^*(x)\\cdot\\phi(x)\\,.</math>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Mathematics|Physics}}\n* [[Angular momentum diagrams (quantum mechanics)]]\n* [[N-slit interferometric equation|{{mvar|n}}-slit interferometric equation]]\n* [[Quantum state]]\n* [[Inner product]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite journal |last=Dirac |first=P.

It lies between [[Violet (color)|violet]] and [[green]] on the [[optical spectrum|spectrum]] of [[visible light]]. The eye perceives blue when observing light with a [[dominant wavelength]] between approximately 450 and 495 [[nanometre]]s.  Most blues contain a slight mixture of other colors; [[Azure (color)|azure]] contains some green, while [[ultramarine]] contains some violet. The clear daytime sky and the deep sea appear blue because of an optical effect known as [[Rayleigh scattering#Cause of the blue color of the sky|Rayleigh scattering]].  An optical effect called [[Tyndall scattering]] explains [[blue eyes]]. Distant objects appear more blue because of another optical effect called [[atmospheric perspective]].\n\n<!-- second para - history -->\nBlue has been an important colour in art and decoration since ancient times. The semi-precious stone [[lapis lazuli]] was used in ancient Egypt for jewellery and ornament and later, in [[the Renaissance]], to make the pigment [[ultramarine]], the most expensive of all pigments. In the eighth century Chinese artists used [[cobalt blue]] to colour fine [[blue and white porcelain]]. In the [[Middle Ages]], European artists used it in the windows of [[Cathedrals]].  Europeans wore clothing coloured with the vegetable dye [[woad]] until it was replaced by the finer [[indigo]] from America.  In the 19th century, synthetic blue dyes and pigments gradually replaced mineral pigments and synthetic dyes.  Dark blue became a common colour for military uniforms and later, in the late 20th century, for business suits.  Because blue has commonly been associated with harmony, it was chosen as the colour of the flags of the [[United Nations]] and the [[European Union]].<ref>Michel Pastoureau, ''Bleu \u2013 Histoire d'une couleur''</ref>\n\n<!-- third para - symbolism and associations-->Surveys in the US and Europe show that blue is the colour most commonly associated with harmony, faithfulness, confidence, distance, infinity, the imagination, cold, and sometimes with sadness.{{Sfn|Heller|2009|page=24}} In US and European public opinion polls it is the most popular colour, chosen by almost half of both men and women as their favourite colour.{{Sfn|Heller|2009|page=22}} The same surveys also showed that blue was the colour most associated with the masculine, just ahead of black, and was also the colour most associated with intelligence, knowledge, calm and concentration.{{Sfn|Heller|2009|page=24}}\n\n==Shades and variations==\n{{Main article|Shades of blue}}\n[[File:Linear visible spectrum.svg|center|400px|Blue is between violet and green in the spectrum of visible light]]\nBlue is the colour of light between violet and green on the [[visible spectrum]]. Hues of blue include indigo and [[ultramarine]], closer to violet; pure blue, without any mixture of other colours; [[Cyan]], which is midway in the spectrum between blue and green, and the other blue-greens [[Turquoise (color)|turquoise]], [[teal]], and [[aquamarine (color)|aquamarine]].\n\nBlue also varies in shade or tint; darker shades of blue contain black or grey, while lighter tints contain white.  Darker shades of blue include ultramarine, [[cobalt blue]], [[navy blue]], and [[Prussian blue]]; while lighter tints include [[sky blue]], [[azure (color)|azure]], and [[Egyptian blue]]. (For a more complete list see the [[List of colors|List of colours]]).\n\nBlue pigments were originally made from minerals such as [[lapis lazuli]], [[cobalt]] and [[azurite]], and blue dyes were made from plants; usually [[woad]] in Europe, and ''[[Indigofera tinctoria]]'', or true indigo, in Asia and Africa.

See [[Color term|Colour term]].\n\nSeveral languages, including [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Thai language|Thai]], [[Korean Language|Korean]], and [[Lakota Sioux]], use the same word to describe blue and green. For example, in Vietnamese the colour of both tree leaves and the sky is ''xanh''. In Japanese, the word for blue (\u9752 ao) is often used for colours that English speakers would refer to as green, such as the colour of a traffic signal meaning \"go\".

Blues with a higher frequency and thus a shorter wavelength gradually look more violet, while those with a lower frequency and a longer wavelength gradually appear more green. Pure blue, in the middle, has a wavelength of 470 nanometres.\n\nIsaac Newton included blue as one of the seven colours in his first description the [[visible spectrum]],  He chose seven colours because that was the number of notes in the musical scale, which he believed was related to the optical spectrum.  He included [[indigo]], the hue between blue and violet, as one of the separate colours, though today it is usually considered a hue of blue.<ref>Arthur C. Hardy and Fred H. Perrin. ''The Principles of Optics.'' McGraw-Hill Book Co., Inc., New York. 1932.</ref>\n\nIn painting and traditional [[colour theory]], blue is one of the three [[primary color|primary colours]] of pigments (red, yellow, blue), which can be mixed to form a wide [[gamut]] of colours.  Red and blue mixed together form violet, blue and yellow together form green.  Mixing all three primary colours together produces a dark grey. From the Renaissance onwards, painters used this system to create their colours. (See [[RYB]] colour system.)\n\nThe RYB model was used for [[colour printing]] by [[Jacob Christoph Le Blon]] as early as 1725. Later, printers discovered that more accurate colours could be created by using combinations of magenta, cyan, yellow and black ink, put onto separate inked plates and then overlaid one at a time onto paper. This method could produce almost all the colours in the spectrum with reasonable accuracy.\n\nIn the 19th century the Scottish physicist [[James Clerk Maxwell]] found a new way of explaining colours, by the wavelength of their light. He showed that white light could be created by combining red, blue and green light, and that virtually all colours could be made by different combinations of these three colours. His idea, called [[additive colour]] or the [[RGB colour model]], is used today to create colours on televisions and computer screens. The screen is covered by tiny pixels, each with three fluorescent elements for creating red, green and blue light. If the red, blue and green elements all glow at once, the pixel looks white. As the screen is scanned from behind with electrons, each pixel creates its own designated colour, composing a complete picture on the screen.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\" 200px\" >\nFile:RGB illumination.jpg|Additive colour mixing. The projection of [[primary colour]] lights on a screen shows secondary colours where two overlap; the combination red, green, and blue each in full intensity makes white.\nFile:RGB pixels.jpg|Blue and orange pixels on an LCD television screen. Closeup of the red, green and blue sub-pixels on left.\n</gallery>\n\nOn the [[HSL and HSV|HSV colour wheel]], the [[Complementary color|complement]] of blue is [[yellow]]; that is, a colour corresponding to an equal mixture of [[red]] and [[green]] light. On a colour wheel based on traditional colour theory ([[RYB color model|RYB]]) where blue was considered a primary colour, its complementary colour is considered to be [[orange (colour)|orange]] (based on the [[Munsell color system|Munsell colour wheel]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sanford-artedventures.com/study/g_color_wheel.html |title=Glossary Term: Color wheel |website=Sanford-artedventures.com |accessdate=2009-04-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907184837/http://www.sanford-artedventures.com/study/g_color_wheel.html |archivedate=September 7, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n===Pigments and dyes===\nBlue [[pigments]] were made from minerals, especially [[lapis lazuli]] and [[azurite]] ({{chem|Cu|3|(CO|3|)|2|(OH)|2|)}}.  These minerals were crushed, ground into powder, and then mixed with a quick-drying binding agent, such as egg yolk ([[tempera painting]]); or with a slow-drying oil, such as [[linseed oil]], for [[oil painting]]. To make blue [[stained glass]], [[cobalt blue]] (cobalt(II) aluminate: {{chem|CoAl|2|O|4}})pigment was mixed with the glass. Other common blue pigments made from minerals are [[ultramarine]] ({{chem|Na<sub>8-10</sub>||Al|6|Si|6|O|24|S<sub>2-4</sub>}}), [[cerulean blue]] (primarily cobalt (II) stanate: {{chem|Co|2|SnO|4}}), and [[Prussian blue]] (milori blue: primarily {{chem|Fe|7|(CN)|18}}).\n\n[[Natural dyes]] to colour cloth and tapestries were made from plants. [[Woad]] and [[Indigofera tinctoria|true indigo]] were used to produce [[indigo dye]] used to colour fabrics blue or [[indigo]]. Since the 18th century, natural blue dyes have largely been replaced by synthetic dyes.\n\n{{anchor|Reflex Blue}}\t\n\"Reflex blue\" used to be the name of a common blue pigment in ink manufacturing. \t\nIn the 1960s, the name was adopted into the proprietary [[Pantone Matching System]] (PMS) to refer to this specific pigment.

When sunlight passes through the atmosphere, the blue wavelengths are scattered more widely by the oxygen and nitrogen molecules, and more blue comes to our eyes. This effect is called [[Rayleigh scattering]], after [[Lord Rayleigh]], the British physicist who discovered it. It was confirmed by [[Albert Einstein]] in 1911.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/General/BlueSky/blue_sky.html|title=Why is the sky Blue?|website=ucr.edu|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151102085211/http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/General/BlueSky/blue_sky.html|archivedate=2015-11-02|df=}}</ref>\n\nNear sunrise and sunset, most of the light we see comes in nearly tangent to the Earth's surface, so that the light's path through the atmosphere is so long that much of the blue and even green light is scattered out, leaving the sun rays and the clouds it illuminates red.

For example, mountains in the distance often appear blue.

In a painting where different parts of the composition are blue, green and red, the blue will appear to be more distant, and the red closer to the viewer.

The Greek word for dark blue, ''kyaneos'', could also mean dark green, violet, black or brown. The ancient Greek word for a light blue, ''glaukos'', also could mean light green, grey, or yellow.<ref>Michel Pastourou, ''Bleu: Histoire d'une couleur'', p. 24</ref> The Greeks imported indigo dye from India, calling it indikon. They used Egyptian blue in the wall paintings of [[Knossos]], in Crete, (2100 BC). It was not one of the four primary colours for Greek painting described by [[Pliny the Elder]] (red, yellow, black, and white), but nonetheless it was used as a background colour behind the friezes on Greek temples and to colour the beards of Greek statues.<ref name=\"Ball106\">Philip Ball, ''Bright Earth: Art and the Invention of Colour'', p. 106</ref>\n\nThe Romans also imported indigo dye, but blue was the colour of working class clothing; the nobles and rich wore white, black, red or violet. Blue was considered the colour of mourning, and the colour of barbarians. Julius Caesar reported that the Celts and Germans dyed their faces blue to frighten their enemies, and tinted their hair blue when they grew old.<ref>Caesar, ''The Gallic Wars'', V., 14, 2. Cited by Miche Pastourou, p. 178.</ref> Nonetheless, the Romans made extensive use of blue for decoration. According to [[Vitruvius]], they made dark blue pigment from indigo, and imported Egyptian blue pigment. The walls of Roman villas in [[Pompeii]] had frescoes of brilliant blue skies, and blue pigments were found in the shops of colour merchants.<ref name=\"Ball106\"/> The Romans had many different words for varieties of blue, including ''caeruleus'', ''caesius'', ''glaucus'', ''cyaneus'', ''lividus'', ''venetus'', ''aerius'', and ''ferreus'', but two words, both of foreign origin, became the most enduring; ''blavus'', from the Germanic word ''blau'', which eventually became ''bleu'' or blue; and ''azureus'', from the Arabic word ''lazaward'', which became azure.<ref>Michel Pastoureau, ''Bleu: Histoire d'une couleur'', p. 26.</ref>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\" 150px\" >\nFile:Mesolapis.jpg|[[Lapis lazuli]] pendant from [[Mesopotamia]] (c. 2900 BC).\nFile:Lapis bowl Iran.JPG|A lapis lazuli bowl from Iran (End of 3rd, beginning 2nd millennium BC)\nFile:Hippopotamus-E 7709-IMG 9899-gradient.jpg|A hippopotamus decorated with aquatic plants, made of faience with a blue glaze, made to resemble lapis lazuli.

The nobility wore red or purple, while only the poor wore blue clothing, coloured with poor-quality dyes made from the [[woad]] plant. Blue played no part in the rich costumes of the clergy or the architecture or decoration of churches. This changed dramatically between 1130 and 1140 in Paris, when the [[Abbe Suger]] rebuilt the [[Saint Denis Basilica]]. He installed [[stained glass]] windows coloured with [[cobalt]], which, combined with the light from the red glass, filled the church with a bluish violet light. The church became the marvel of the Christian world, and the colour became known as the \"bleu de Saint-Denis\". In the years that followed even more elegant blue stained glass windows were installed in other churches, including at [[Chartres Cathedral]] and [[Sainte-Chapelle]] in Paris.<ref>Michel Pastoureau, Bleu \u2013 Histoire d'une couleur, pp.&nbsp;44\u201347</ref>\n\nAnother important factor in the increased prestige of the colour blue in the 12th century was the veneration of the [[Virgin Mary]], and a change in the colours used to depict her clothing. In earlier centuries her robes had usually been painted in sombre black, grey, violet, dark green or dark blue. In the 12th century the Roma Catholic Church dictated that painters in Italy (and the rest of Europe consequently) to paint the Virgin Mary with the new most expensive pigment imported from Asia; [[ultramarine]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} Blue became associated with holiness, humility and virtue.\n\nUltramarine was made from lapis lazuli, from the mines of [[Badakshan]], in the mountains of Afghanistan, near the source of the [[Oxus]] River. The mines were visited by Marco Polo in about 1271; he reported, \"here is found a high mountain from which they extract the finest and most beautiful of blues.\" Ground lapis was used in Byzantine manuscripts as early as the 6th century, but it was impure and varied greatly in colour. Ultramarine refined out the impurities through a long and difficult process, creating a rich and deep blue. It was called ''bleu outremer'' in French and ''blu oltremare'' in Italian, since it came from the other side of the sea. It cost far more than any other colour, and it became the luxury colour for the Kings and Princes of Europe.<ref>Philip Ball, ''Bright Earth, Art and Invention of Colour''. p. 346</ref>\n\nKing [[Louis IX of France]], better known as Saint Louis (1214\u20131270), became the first king of France to regularly dress in blue. This was copied by other nobles.  Paintings of the mythical [[King Arthur]] began to show him dressed in blue.  The coat of arms of the kings of France became an azure or light blue shield, sprinkled with golden [[fleur-de-lis]] or lilies. Blue had come from obscurity to become the royal colour.<ref>Michel Pastoureau, ''Blue \u2013 Histoire d'une couleur'', pp.&nbsp;51\u201352.</ref>\n\nOnce blue became the colour of the king, it also became the colour of the wealthy and powerful in Europe. In the Middle Ages in France and to some extent in Italy, the dyeing of blue cloth was subject to license from the crown or state. In Italy, the dyeing of blue was assigned to a specific guild, the ''tintori di guado,'' and could not be done by anyone else without severe penalty. The wearing of blue implied some dignity and some wealth.<ref>Daniel V. Thompson, ''The Materials and Techniques of Medieval Painting'' (1956), Dover Publications, New York, ({{ISBN|0-486-20327-1}})</ref>\n\nBesides ultramarine, several other blues were widely used in the Middle Ages and later in the Renaissance. [[Azurite]], a form of copper carbonate, was often used as a substitute for ultramarine. The Romans used it under the name lapis armenius, or Armenian stone. The British called it azure of Amayne, or German azure. The Germans themselves called it bergblau, or mountain stone. It was mined in France, Hungary, Spain and Germany, and it made a pale blue with a hint of green, which was ideal for painting skies. It was a favourite background colour of the German painter [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]].<ref>Philip Ball, ''Bright Earth, Art and the Invention of Colour''. pp.&nbsp;139\u201340</ref>\n\nAnother blue often used in the Middle Ages was called tournesol or folium. It was made from the plant [[Crozophora tinctoria]], which grew in the south of France. It made a fine transparent blue valued in medieval manuscripts.<ref>Philip Ball, Bright Earth, Art and the Invention of Colour. pp.&nbsp;141\u201343</ref>\n\nAnother common blue pigment was [[smalt]], which was made by grinding blue cobalt glass into a fine powder. It made a deep violet blue similar to ultramarine, and was vivid in frescoes, but it lost some of its brilliance in oil paintings. It became especially popular in the 17th century, when ultramarine was difficult to obtain. It was employed at times by [[Titian]], [[Tintoretto]], [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]], [[El Greco]], [[Van Dyck]], [[Rubens]] and [[Rembrandt]].<ref>Philip Ball, Bright Earth, Art and the Invention of Colour. p. 178</ref>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\" 150px\">\nFile:Basilique Saint-Denis chapelle de la Vierge.jpg|Stained glass windows of the Basilica of Saint Denis (1141\u20131144).\nFile:Chartres - cath\u00e9drale - ND de la belle verri\u00e8re.JPG|Notre Dame de la Belle Verri\u00e8re window, Chartres Cathedral.

(painted in 1450).\n</gallery>\n\n===In the European Renaissance===\nIn the Renaissance, a revolution occurred in painting; artists began to paint the world as it was actually seen, with perspective, depth, shadows, and light from a single source. Artists had to adapt their use of blue to the new rules.  In medieval paintings, blue was used to attract the attention of the viewer to the Virgin Mary, and identify her. In Renaissance paintings, artists tried to create harmonies between blue and red, lightening the blue with lead white paint and adding shadows and highlights. [[Raphael]] was a master of this technique, carefully balancing the reds and the blues so no one colour dominated the picture.<ref>Philip Ball, ''Bright Earth, Art and Invention of Colour'', p. 165</ref>\n\nUltramarine was the most prestigious blue of the Renaissance, and patrons sometimes specified that it be used in paintings they commissioned. The contract for the ''Madone des Harpies'' by [[Andrea del Sarto]] (1514) required that the robe of the Virgin Mary be coloured with ultramarine costing \"at least five good florins an ounce.\"<ref>Philip Ball, ''Bright Earth, Art and Invention of Colour'', p. 347</ref> Good ultramarine was more expensive than gold; in 1508 the German painter [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]] reported in a letter that he had paid twelve ducats \u2013 the equivalent of forty-one grams of gold \u2013 for just thirty grams of ultramarine.<ref>Eva Heller, ''Psychologie de la couleur \u2013 effets et symboliques'' p. 20.</ref>\n\nOften painters or clients saved money by using less expensive blues, such as azurite smalt, or pigments made with indigo, but this sometimes caused problems. Pigments made from azurite were less expensive, but tended to turn dark and green with time. An example is the robe of the Virgin Mary in The ''[[Madonna and Child Enthroned with Saints (Raphael)|Madonna and Child Enthroned with Saints]]'' by [[Raphael]] in the [[Metropolitan Museum]] in New York. The Virgin Mary's azurite blue robe has degraded into a greenish-black.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/110001822|title=Raphael (Raffaello Sanzio or Santi) \u2013 Madonna and Child Enthroned with Saints \u2013 The Metropolitan Museum of Art|website=metmuseum.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120704115007/http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/110001822|archivedate=2012-07-04|df=}}</ref>\n\nThe introduction of oil painting changed the way colours looked and how they were used.  Ultramarine pigment, for instance, was much darker when used in oil painting than when used in [[tempera]] painting, in frescoes.  To balance their colours, Renaissance artists like Raphael added white to lighten the ultramarine.  The sombre dark blue robe of the Virgin Mary became a brilliant sky blue.<ref>Philip Ball, ''Bright Earth, Art and Invention of Colour'', p. 171</ref> [[Titian]] created his rich blues by using many thin glazes of paint of different blues and violets which allowed the light to pass through, which made a complex and luminous colour, like stained glass. He also used layers of finely ground or coarsely ground ultramarine, which gave subtle variations to the blue.<ref>Philip Ball, ''Bright Earth, Art and Invention of Colour'', pp.&nbsp;186\u201389</ref>\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\" 150px\" >\nFile:Giotto - Scrovegni - -18- - Adoration of the Magi.jpg|[[Giotto]] was one of the first Italian Renaissance painters to use [[ultramarine]], here in the murals of the Arena Chapel in [[Padua]] (circa 1305).\nFile:Angelico, madonna col bambino, pinacoteca sabauda.jpg|Throughout the 14th and 15th centuries, the robes of the [[Virgin Mary]] were painted with [[ultramarine]].

Beginning in the 14th century, this type of porcelain was exported in large quantity to Europe where it inspired a whole style of art, called [[Chinoiserie]].  European courts tried for many years to imitate Chinese blue and white porcelain, but only succeeded in the 18th century after a missionary brought the secret back from China.\n\nOther famous white and blue patterns appeared in Delft, Meissen, Staffordshire, and Saint Petersburg, Russia.\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\" 200px\" >\nFile:Early blue and white ware circa 1335 Jingdezhen.jpg|Chinese [[blue and white porcelain]] from about 1335, made in Jingdezhen, the porcelain centre of China.

The rise of the colour blue in fashion in the 12th and 13th centuries led to a blue dye industry in several cities, notably [[Amiens]], [[Toulouse]], and [[Erfurt]]. They made a dye called pastel from [[woad]], a plant common in Europe, which had been used to make blue dye by the Celts and German tribes.  Blue became a colour worn by domestics and artisans, not just nobles. In 1570, when Pope [[Pius V]] listed the colours that could be used for ecclesiastical dress and for altar decoration, he excluded blue, because he considered it too common.<ref name=autogenerated3>Eva Heller, ''Psychologie de la couleur effets et symboliques'' p. 21</ref>\n\nThe process of making blue with woad was long and noxious \u2013 it involved soaking the leaves of the plant for from three days to a week in human urine, ideally urine from men who had been drinking a great deal of alcohol, which was said to improve the colour. The fabric was then soaked for a day in the resulting mixture, then put out in the sun, where as it dried it turned blue.<ref name=autogenerated3 />\n\nThe pastel industry was threatened in the 15th century by the arrival from India of the same dye ([[indigo]]), obtained from a shrub widely grown in Asia. The Asian indigo dye precursors is more readily obtained. In 1498, [[Vasco de Gama]] opened a trade route to import indigo from India to Europe.  In India, the indigo leaves were soaked in water, fermented, pressed into cakes, dried into bricks, then carried to the ports London, Marseille, Genoa, and Bruges. Later, in the 17th century, the British, Spanish, and Dutch established indigo plantations in Jamaica, South Carolina, the Virgin Islands and South America, and began to import American indigo to Europe.\n\nThe countries with large and prosperous pastel industries tried to block the use of indigo. The German government outlawed the use of indigo in 1577, describing it as a \"pernicious, deceitful and corrosive substance, the Devil's dye.\"<ref>[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/13242/13242-8.txt ''Lippincott's Magazine of Popular Literature and Science'', Volume 17, No. 100, April 1876] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106154802/http://www.gutenberg.org/files/13242/13242-8.txt |date=2012-11-06 }}.</ref><ref>D G Schreber, ''Historische, physische und economische Beschreibung des Waidtes'', 1752, the appendix; Thorpe JF and Ingold CK, 1923, ''Synthetic colouring matters \u2013 vat colours'' (London: Longmans, Green), p. 23</ref> In France, [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]], in an edict of 1609, forbade under pain of death the use of \"the false and pernicious Indian drug\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Foucaud |first=\u00c9douard |editor-last=Frost |editor-first=John |title=The book of illustrious mechanics of Europe and America |year=1846 |page=236 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TaQbAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA236 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160629124556/https://books.google.com/books?id=TaQbAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA236 |archivedate=2016-06-29 |df= }}</ref> It was forbidden in England until 1611, when British traders established their own indigo industry in India and began to import it into Europe.<ref name=autogenerated4>Eva Heller, ''Psychologie de la couleur \u2013 effets et symboliques'' p. 28</ref>\n\nThe efforts to block indigo were in vain; the quality of indigo blue was too high and the price too low for pastel made from woad to compete. In 1737 both the French and German governments finally allowed the use of indigo. This ruined the dye industries in Toulouse and the other cities that produced pastel, but created a thriving new indigo commerce to seaports such as Bordeaux, Nantes and Marseille.<ref>F.

The German chemical firm BASF put the new dye on the market in 1897, in direct competition with the British-run indigo industry in India, which produced most of the world's indigo. In 1897 Britain sold ten thousand tons of natural indigo on the world market, while BASF sold six hundred tons of synthetic indigo. The British industry cut prices and reduced the salaries of its workers, but it was unable to compete; the synthetic indigo was more pure, made a more lasting blue, and was not dependent upon good or bad harvests. In 1911, India sold only 660 tons of natural indigo, while BASF sold 22,000 tons of synthetic indigo.  In 2002, more than 38,000 tons of synthetic indigo was produced, often for the production of blue jeans.<ref name=Ullmann>Elmar Steingruber \"Indigo and Indigo Colorants\" Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2004, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI| 10.1002/14356007.a14_149.pub2}}</ref>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\" 150px\" >\nFile:Isatis tinctoria02.JPG|[[Isatis tinctoria]], or woad, was the main source of blue dye in Europe from ancient times until the arrival of indigo from Asia and America.

The reasons were economic; the German states were trying to protect their pastel dye industry against competition from imported indigo dye. When Brandenburg became the Kingdom of [[Prussia]] in 1701, the uniform colour was adopted by the Prussian army. Most German soldiers wore dark blue uniforms until the [[First World War]], with the exception of the Bavarians, who wore light blue.<ref>Eva Heller, ''Psychologie de la couleur, effets et symboliques'' p. 30</ref>\n\nThanks in part to the availability of indigo dye, the 18th century saw the widespread use of blue military uniforms. Prior to 1748, British naval officers simply wore upper-class civilian clothing and wigs. In 1748, the British uniform for naval officers was officially established as an embroidered coat of the colour then called marine blue, now known as [[navy blue]].<ref>J.R. Hill, ''The Oxford Illustrated History of the Royal Navy'', Oxford University Press, 1995.</ref> When the [[Continental Navy]] of the United States was created in 1775, it largely copied the British uniform and colour.\n\nIn the late 18th century, the blue uniform became a symbol of liberty and revolution. In October 1774, even before the United States declared its independence, [[George Mason]] and one hundred Virginia neighbours of [[George Washington]] organised a voluntary militia unit (the Fairfax County Independent Company of Volunteers) and elected Washington the honorary commander.  For their uniforms they chose blue and [[Buff (colour)|buff]], the colours of the [[Whig (British political party)|Whig Party]], the opposition party in England, whose policies were supported by George Washington and many other [[Patriot (American Revolution)|patriots]] in the American colonies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blueandbuff.blogspot.com/2009/10/buff-and-blue-whig-politics-in-late.html|title=Blue and Buff: Buff and Blue: Whig politics in the late 18th century|author=Blue and Buff|website=blueandbuff.blogspot.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416121410/http://blueandbuff.blogspot.com/2009/10/buff-and-blue-whig-politics-in-late.html|archivedate=2014-04-16|df=}}</ref><ref>[[Ron Chernow]], ''[[Washington: A Life]]'', p. 174. {{ISBN|978-0-14-311996-8}}.</ref>\n\nWhen the [[Continental Army]] was established in 1775 at the outbreak of the [[American Revolution]], the first [[Continental Congress]] declared that the official uniform colour would be brown, but this was not popular with many militias, whose officers were already wearing blue. In 1778 the Congress asked George Washington to design a new uniform, and in 1779 Washington made the official colour of all uniforms blue and [[buff (colour)|buff]]. Blue continued to be the colour of the field uniform of the US Army until 1902, and is still the colour of the dress uniform.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mil/symbols/uniforms/history.html|title=Army Dress Uniform|website=army.mil|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141119095538/http://www.army.mil/symbols/uniforms/history.html|archivedate=2014-11-19|df=}}</ref>\n\nIn France the [[Gardes Fran\u00e7aises]], the elite regiment which protected [[Louis XVI]], wore dark blue uniforms with red trim. In 1789, the soldiers gradually changed their allegiance from the king to the people, and they played a leading role in the [[storming of the Bastille]]. After the fall of Bastille, a new armed force, the [[Garde Nationale]], was formed under the command of the [[Marquis de Lafayette]], who had served with George Washington in America. Lafayette gave the Garde Nationale dark blue uniforms similar to those of the Continental Army. Blue became the colour of the revolutionary armies, opposed to the white uniforms of the Royalists and the Austrians.<ref>Jean Tulard, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Fayard, Alfred Fierro, ''Histoire et dictionnaire de la R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise'', 1789\u20131799, \u00c9ditions Robert Laffont, collection Bouquins, Paris, 1987. {{ISBN|2-7028-2076-X}}</ref>\n\n[[Napoleon Bonaparte]] abandoned many of the doctrines of the French Revolution but he kept blue as the uniform colour for his army, although he had great difficulty obtaining the blue dye, since the British controlled the seas and blocked the importation of indigo to France. Napoleon was forced to dye uniforms with woad, which had an inferior blue colour.<ref>Michel Pastoureau, ''Bleu \u2013 Histoire d'une couleur'', pp.&nbsp;137\u201340</ref> The French army wore a dark blue uniform coat with red trousers until 1915, when it was found to be a too visible target on the battlefields of [[World War I]].  It was replaced with uniforms of a light blue-grey colour called horizon blue.\n\nBlue was the colour of liberty and revolution in the 18th century, but in the 19th it increasingly became the colour of government authority, the uniform colour of policemen and other public servants. It was considered serious and authoritative, without being menacing. In 1829, when [[Robert Peel]] created the first [[London Metropolitan Police]], he made the colour of the uniform jacket a dark, almost black blue, to make the policemen look different from soldiers, who until then had patrolled the streets. The traditional blue jacket with silver buttons of the London \"bobbie\" was not abandoned until the mid-1990s, when it was replaced by a light blue shirt and a jumper or sweater of the colour officially known as NATO blue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.met.police.uk/history/definition.htm|title=History|author=Metropolitan Police|website=met.police.uk|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20081203173318/http://www.met.police.uk/history/definition.htm|archivedate=2008-12-03|df=}}</ref>\n\nThe [[New York City Police Department]], modelled after the London Metropolitan Police, was created in 1844, and in 1853, they were officially given a navy blue uniform, the colour they wear today.<ref name=\"okidegbe\">{{Citation |last=Okidegbe |first=Ngozi |chapter=I Love a Man in Uniform: The Debate Surrounding Uniforming the New York Police Force in the 19th Century |editor-last=Wiggerich |editor-first=Sandro |editor2-last=Kensy |editor2-first=Steven |title=Staat Macht Uniform |publisher=Franz Steiner Verlag |publication-date=2011 |isbn=978-3-515-09933-2}}</ref>\n\nNavy blue is one of the most popular school uniform colors, with the Toronto Catholic District School Board adopting a dress code policy which requires students system-wide to wear white tops and navy blue bottoms.\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\" 180px\" >\nFile:Inf.

The Egyptians had created a synthetic colour, Egyptian blue, three thousand years BC, but the formula had been lost. The Chinese had also created synthetic pigments, but the formula was not known in the west.\n\nIn 1709 a German druggist and pigment maker named [[Johann Jacob Diesbach]] accidentally discovered a new blue while experimenting with potassium and iron sulphides. The new colour was first called Berlin blue, but later became known as [[Prussian blue]]. By 1710 it was being used by the French painter [[Antoine Watteau]], and later his successor [[Nicolas Lancret]]. It became immensely popular for the manufacture of wallpaper, and in the 19th century was widely used by French impressionist painters.<ref>Michel Pastoureau, ''Bleu \u2013 HIstoire d'une couleur'', pp.&nbsp;114\u201316</ref>\n\nBeginning in the 1820s, Prussian blue was imported into Japan through the port of [[Nagasaki]]. It was called ''bero-ai'', or Berlin blue, and it became popular because it did not fade like traditional Japanese blue pigment, ''ai-gami'', made from the [[dayflower]]. Prussian blue was used by both [[Hokusai]], in his famous wave paintings, and [[Hiroshige]].<ref>oger Keyes, ''Japanese Woodblock Prints: A Catalogue of the Mary A. Ainsworth Collection'', R, Allen Memorial Art Museum, Oberlin College, 1984, p. 42, plate #140, p. 91 and catalogue entry #439, p. 185.  for more on the story of Prussian blue in Japanese prints, see also the website of the Victoria and Albert Museum, London.</ref>\n\nIn 1824 the [[Societ\u00e9 pour l'Encouragement d'Industrie]] in France offered a prize for the invention of an artificial [[ultramarine]] which could rival the natural colour made from lapis lazuli. The prize was won in 1826 by a chemist named Jean Baptiste Guimet, but he refused to reveal the formula of his colour. In 1828, another scientist, [[Christian Gmelin]] then a professor of chemistry in T\u00fcbingen, found the process and published his formula. This was the beginning of new industry to manufacture artificial ultramarine, which eventually almost completely replaced the natural product.<ref>Maerz and Paul (1930).  ''A Dictionary of Color'' New York: McGraw Hill p. 206</ref>\n\nIn 1878 a German chemist named a. Von Baeyer discovered a synthetic substitute for [[indigotine]], the active ingredient of indigo. This product gradually replaced natural indigo, and after the end of the First World War, it brought an end to the trade of indigo from the East and West Indies.\n\nIn 1901 a new synthetic blue dye, called [[Indanthrone blue]], was invented, which had even greater resistance to fading during washing or in the sun. This dye gradually replaced artificial indigo, whose production ceased in about 1970. Today almost all blue clothing is dyed with an indanthrone blue.<ref>Eva Heller, ''Psychologie de la couleur,'' p. 32.</ref>\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\" 200px\" >\nFile:The Blue Boy.jpg|[[Thomas Gainsborough]]'s ''[[The Blue Boy]]'' includes \"the lavish lapis lazuli, the darker indigo pigment and the paler cobalt.\"<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.tate.org.uk/context-comment/blogs/eight-blue-moments-art-history | title = Eight blue moments in art history | publisher = The Tate}}</ref>\nFile:Great Wave off Kanagawa2.jpg|The 19th-century Japanese woodblock artist [[Hokusai]] used [[Prussian blue]], a synthetic colour imported from Europe, in his wave paintings, such as in ''[[The Great Wave off Kanagawa]]''.\nFile:Indigoproduktion BASF 1890.JPG|A synthetic indigo dye factory in Germany in 1890.

[[J.M.W. Turner]] experimented with the new cobalt blue, and of the twenty colours most used by the [[Impressionism|Impressionists]], twelve were new and synthetic colours, including cobalt blue, ultramarine and cerulean blue.<ref name=\"Ball265\">Philip Ball, ''Bright Earth, Art and the Invention of Colour'', p. 265.</ref>\n\nAnother important influence on painting in the 19th century was the theory of complementary colours, developed by the French chemist Michel Eugene Chevreul in 1828 and published in 1839. He demonstrated that placing complementary colours, such as blue and yellow-orange or ultramarine and yellow, next to each other heightened the intensity of each colour \"to the apogee of their tonality.\"<ref>Michel Eugene Chevreul, ''De la loi du contraste simultan\u00e9 des couleurs'', Paris,  (1839).  Cited by Philip Ball, p. 257.</ref>  In 1879 an American physicist, Ogden Rood, published a book charting the complementary colours of each colour in the spectrum.<ref>Ogden Rood, Modern Chromatics, (1879).</ref> This principle of painting was used by Claude Monet in his ''Impression \u2013 Sunrise \u2013 Fog'' (1872), where he put a vivid blue next to a bright orange sun, (1872) and in ''R\u00e9gate \u00e0 Argenteuil'' (1872), where he painted an orange sun against blue water. The colours brighten each other. Renoir used the same contrast of cobalt blue water and an orange sun in ''Canotage sur la Seine'' (1879\u20131880). Both Monet and Renoir liked to use pure colours, without any blending.<ref name=\"Ball265\"/>\n\nMonet and the impressionists were among the first to observe that shadows were full of colour. In his ''La Gare Saint-Lazare'', the grey smoke, vapour and dark shadows are actually composed of mixtures of bright pigment, including cobalt blue, cerulean blue, synthetic ultramarine, emerald green, Guillet green, chrome yellow, vermilion and ecarlate red.<ref>Philip Ball, ''Bright Earth, Art and the Invention of Colour'', p. 268.</ref> Blue was a favourite colour of the impressionist painters, who used it not just to depict nature but to create moods, feelings and atmospheres. [[Cobalt blue]], a pigment of cobalt oxide-aluminium oxide, was a favourite of [[Auguste Renoir]] and [[Vincent van Gogh]]. It was similar to [[smalt]], a pigment used for centuries to make blue glass, but it was much improved by the French chemist [[Louis Jacques Th\u00e9nard]], who introduced it in 1802.  It was very stable but extremely expensive. Van Gogh wrote to his brother Theo, \"'Cobalt [blue] is a divine colour and there is nothing so beautiful for putting atmosphere around things&nbsp;...\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Cobalt blue |url=http://webexhibits.org/pigments/indiv/overview/coblue.html |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120620100134/http://www.webexhibits.org/pigments/indiv/overview/coblue.html |archivedate=2012-06-20 |df= }}</ref>\n\nVan Gogh described to his brother Theo how he composed a sky: \"The dark blue sky is spotted with clouds of an even darker blue than the fundamental blue of intense cobalt, and others of a lighter blue, like the bluish white of the Milky Way&nbsp;... the sea was very dark ultramarine, the shore a sort of violet and of light red as I see it, and on the dunes, a few bushes of prussian blue.\"<ref>Letter to his brother Theo, (1888).

Wearing blue implied dignity and wealth, and blue clothing was restricted to the nobility.<ref>Daniel V. Thompson (1956), ''The Materials and Techniques of Medieval Painting'', Dover Publications, New York ({{ISBN|0-486-20327-1}})</ref> However, blue was replaced by black as the power colour in the 14th century, when European princes, and then merchants and bankers, wanted to show their seriousness, dignity and devoutness (see [[Black]]).\n\nBlue gradually returned to court fashion in the 17th century, as part of a palette of peacock-bright colours shown off in extremely elaborate costumes. The modern blue business suit has its roots in England in the middle of the 17th century. Following the London plague of 1665 and the [[London fire]] of 1666, King [[Charles II of England]] ordered that his courtiers wear simple coats, waistcoats and breeches, and the palette of colours became blue, grey, white and buff. Widely imitated, this style of men's fashion became almost a uniform of the London merchant class and the English country gentleman.<ref name=\"SuitablyDressed\">\"Suitably Dressed,\" the ''Economist'', December 16, 2010.</ref>\n\nDuring the American Revolution, the leader of the Whig Party in England, [[Charles James Fox]], wore a blue coat and buff waistcoat and breeches, the colours of the Whig Party and of the uniform of [[George Washington]], whose principles he supported. The men's suit followed the basic form of the military uniforms of the time, particularly the uniforms of the cavalry.<ref name=\"SuitablyDressed\"/>\n\nIn the early 19th century, during the [[British Regency|Regency]] of the future King [[George IV]], the blue suit was revolutionised by a courtier named George [[Beau Brummel]]. Brummel created a suit that closely fitted the human form.  The new style had a long tail coat cut to fit the body and long tight trousers to replace the knee-length breeches and stockings of the previous century. He used plain colours, such as blue and grey, to concentrate attention on the form of the body, not the clothes. Brummel observed, \"If people turn to look at you in the street, you are not well dressed.\"<ref>*Kelly, Ian. ''Beau Brummell: The Ultimate Dandy''. Hodder & Stoughton, 2005</ref>  This fashion was adopted by the Prince Regent, then by London society and the upper classes.  Originally the coat and trousers were different colours, but in the 19th century the suit of a single colour became fashionable. By the late 19th century the black suit had become the uniform of businessmen in England and America. In the 20th century, the black suit was largely replaced by the dark blue or grey suit.<ref name=\"SuitablyDressed\"/>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\" 150px\" >\nFile:Louis-innocentiv.jpg|King [[Louis IX of France]] (on the right, with Pope Innocent) was the first European king to wear blue.

During his [[Blue Period]] (1901\u20131904) [[Pablo Picasso]] used blue and green, with hardly any warm colours, to create a melancholy mood. In Russia, the [[symbolist]] painter [[Pavel Kuznetsov]] and the [[Blue Rose (art group)|Blue Rose]] art group (1906\u20131908) used blue to create a fantastic and exotic atmosphere. In Germany, [[Wassily Kandinsky]] and other Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9s formed the art group called [[Der Blaue Reiter]] (The Blue Rider), and used blue to symbolise spirituality and eternity.<ref name=autogenerated1>Wassily Kandinsky, M.

Matisse wrote, \"A certain blue penetrates your soul.\"<ref>\"Un certain bleu p\u00e9n\u00e8tre votre \u00e2me.\" Cited by C.A. Riley, ''Color Codes'', University Press of New England, Hanover, New Hampshire, 1995.</ref>\n\nIn the art of the second half of the 20th century, painters of the [[abstract expressionist]] movement began to use blue and other colours in pure form, without any attempt to represent anything, to inspire ideas and emotions. Painter [[Mark Rothko]] observed that colour was \"only an instrument;\" his interest was \"in expressing human emotions tragedy, ecstasy, doom, and so on.\"<ref>''Mark Rothko 1903\u20131970''. Tate Gallery Publishing, 1987.</ref>\n\nIn fashion blue, particularly dark blue, was seen as a colour which was serious but not grim. In the mid-20th century, blue passed black as the most common colour of men's business suits, the costume usually worn by political and business leaders. Public opinion polls in the United States and Europe showed that blue was the favourite colour of over fifty per cent of respondents. Green was far behind with twenty per cent, while white and red received about eight per cent each.<ref>Michel Pastoureau, ''Bleu \u2013 Histoire d'une couleur'', pp.&nbsp;149\u201353.</ref>\n\nIn 1873 a German immigrant in San Francisco, [[Levi Strauss]], invented a sturdy kind of work trousers, made of [[denim]] fabric and coloured with [[indigo]] dye, called [[jeans|blue jeans]]. In 1935, they were raised to the level of high fashion by [[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue magazine]]. Beginning in the 1950s, they became an essential part of uniform of young people in the United States, Europe, and around the world.\n\nBlue was also seen as a colour which was authoritative without being threatening. Following the [[Second World War]], blue was adopted as the colour of important international organisations, including the United Nations, the [[Council of Europe]], [[UNESCO]], the European Union, and [[NATO]]. United Nations peacekeepers wear blue helmets to stress their peacekeeping role. Blue is used by the [[NATO Military Symbols for Land Based Systems]] to denote friendly forces, hence the term \"blue on blue\" for [[friendly fire]], and [[Blue Force Tracking]] for location of friendly units. The [[People's Liberation Army]] of China (formerly known as the \"Red Army\") uses the term \"Blue Army\" to refer to hostile forces during exercises.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sinodefence.com/army/organisation/blue-army.asp|title=Blue Army (OPFOR) Units|accessdate=2013-05-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130814034817/http://www.sinodefence.com/army/organisation/blue-army.asp|archivedate=2013-08-14|df=}}</ref>\n\nThe 20th century saw the invention of new ways of creating blue, such as [[chemiluminescence]], making blue light through a chemical reaction.\n\nIn the 20th century, it also became possible to own your own colour of blue. The French artist [[Yves Klein]], with the help of a French paint dealer, created a specific blue called [[International Klein blue]], which he patented. It was made of ultramarine combined with a resin called Rhodopa, which gave it a particularly brilliant colour. The baseball team the Los Angeles Dodgers developed its own blue, called [[Dodger blue]], and several American universities invented new blues for their colours.\n\nWith the dawn of the [[World Wide Web]], blue has become the standard colour for [[hyperlinks]] in [[Graphical user interface|graphic browsers]] (though in most browsers links turn purple if you visit their target), to make their presence within text obvious to readers.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\" 180px\" >\nFile:Old guitarist chicago.jpg|During his [[Blue Period]], [[Pablo Picasso]] used blue as the colour of melancholy, as in ''[[The Old Guitarist]]''.\nFile:Kuznetsov vstepi.jpg|The Russian avant-garde painter [[Pavel Kuznetsov]] and his group, the [[Blue Rose]], used blue to symbolise fantasy and exoticism.

[[ragtime]] singer and guitarist. He played with a fluid, syncopated [[fingerstyle guitar]] technique, common among many exponents of Piedmont blues. Unlike his contemporaries, he came to use [[twelve-string guitar]]s exclusively. McTell was also an adept [[Slide (guitar)|slide guitarist]], unusual among ragtime bluesmen. His vocal style, a smooth and often laid-back [[tenor]], differed greatly from many of the harsher voices of [[Delta blues|Delta]] bluesmen such as [[Charley Patton]]. McTell performed in various musical styles, including [[blues]], [[ragtime]], [[Gospel music|religious music]] and [[hokum]].\n\nMcTell was born in [[Thomson, Georgia]]. He learned to play the guitar in his early teens. He soon became a street performer in several Georgia cities, including [[Atlanta]] and [[Augusta, Georgia|Augusta]], and first recorded in 1927 for [[Victor Records]]. He never produced a major [[hit record]], but he had a prolific recording career with different labels and under different names in the 1920s and 1930s. In 1940, he was recorded by the folklorist [[John A. Lomax]] and [[Ruby Terrill Lomax]] for the folk song archive of the [[Library of Congress]]. He was active in the 1940s and 1950s, playing on the streets of Atlanta, often with his longtime associate [[Curley Weaver]]. Twice more he recorded professionally. His last recordings originated during an impromptu session recorded by an Atlanta record store owner in 1956. McTell died three years later, having suffered for years from diabetes and alcoholism. Despite his lack of commercial success, he was one of the few blues musicians of his generation who continued to actively play and record during the 1940s and 1950s. He did not live to see the [[American folk music revival]], in which many other bluesmen were \"rediscovered.\"<ref name=NGE/>\n\nMcTell's influence extended over a wide variety of artists, including the [[The Allman Brothers Band|Allman Brothers Band]], who covered his \"[[Statesboro Blues]],\" and [[Bob Dylan]], who paid tribute to him in his 1983 song \"[[Blind Willie McTell (song)|Blind Willie McTell]],\" the refrain of which is \"And I know no one can sing the blues like Blind Willie McTell.\" Other artists influenced by McTell include [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]], [[Alvin Youngblood Hart]], [[Ralph McTell]], [[Chris Smither]], [[Jack White]], and the [[The White Stripes|White Stripes]].\n\n==Biography==\nHe was born William Samuel McTier<ref name=UNC>Conner, Patrick. \"[http://toto.lib.unca.edu/sounds/piedmontblues/mctell.html Blind Willie McTell] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101173308/http://toto.lib.unca.edu/sounds/piedmontblues/mctell.html |date=November 1, 2013 }}\".

He was related to the bluesman and gospel pioneer [[Thomas A. Dorsey]].<ref name=UNC /> McTell's father left the family when Willie was young. After his mother died, in the 1920s, he left his hometown and became an itinerant musician, or \"[[songster]].\" He began his recording career in 1927 for [[Victor Records]] in [[Atlanta]].<ref name=green>Green, Justin. ''Musical Legends''. {{ISBN|0-86719-587-8}}.</ref>\n\nMcTell married Ruth Kate Williams,<ref name=\"NGE\"/> now better known as [[Kate McTell]], in 1934. She accompanied him on stage and on several recordings before becoming a nurse in 1939. For most of their marriage, from 1942 until his death, they lived apart, she in [[Fort Gordon]], near Augusta, and he working around Atlanta.\n\nIn the years before [[World War II]], McTell traveled and performed widely, recording for several labels under different names: Blind Willie McTell (for Victor and Decca), Blind Sammie (for Columbia), Georgia Bill (for Okeh), Hot Shot Willie (for Victor), Blind Willie (for Vocalion and Bluebird), Barrelhouse Sammie (for Atlantic), and Pig & Whistle Red (for Regal). The appellation \"Pig & Whistle\" was a reference to a chain of barbecue restaurants in Atlanta;{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} McTell often played for tips in the parking lot of a Pig 'n Whistle restaurant. He also played behind a nearby building that later became Ray Lee's Blue Lantern Lounge. Like [[Lead Belly]], another songster who began his career as a street artist, McTell favored the somewhat unwieldy and unusual [[twelve-string guitar]], whose greater volume made it suitable for outdoor playing.\n\nIn 1940 John A. Lomax and his wife, [[Ruby Terrill Lomax]], a professor of [[classics]] at the [[University of Texas at Austin]], interviewed and recorded McTell for the Archive of American Folk Song of the Library of Congress in a two-hour session held in their hotel room in Atlanta.<ref name=\"Russell 3\">{{cite book|first=Tony|last=Russell|year=1997|title=The Blues: From Robert Johnson to Robert Cray|publisher=Carlton Books|location=Dubai|page=13|isbn=1-85868-255-X}}</ref> These recordings document McTell's distinctive musical style, which bridges the gap between the raw country blues of the early part of the 20th century and the more conventionally melodious, [[ragtime]]-influenced East Coast Piedmont blues sound. The Lomaxes also elicited from the singer traditional songs (such as [[Boll Weevil (song)|\"The Boll Weevil\"]] and [[John Henry (folklore)#Music|\"John Henry\"]]) and spirituals (such as \"[[Amazing Grace]]\"), which were not part of his usual commercial repertoire. In the interview, John A. Lomax is heard asking if McTell knows any \"complaining\" songs (an earlier term for [[protest song]]s), to which the singer replies somewhat uncomfortably and evasively that he does not. The Library of Congress paid McTell $10, the equivalent of $154.56 in 2011, for this two-hour session.<ref name=green /> The material from this 1940 session was issued in 1960 as an LP and later as a CD, under the somewhat misleading title ''The Complete Library of Congress Recordings'', notwithstanding the fact that it was truncated, in that it omitted some of John A. Lomax's interactions with the singer and entirely omitted the contributions of Ruby Terrill Lomax.<ref>McTell's biographer [[Michael Gray (author)|Michael Gray]] attributes these omissions to the folklore archivist Rae Korson, who was evidently hostile to his New Deal folklore predecessors at the library: \"The widely sold version of the McTell-Lomax sessions deletes conversations and information, removes Ruby Lomax from the room almost entirely\u2014making John Lomax seem to monopolize things and keep her silent, which he doesn\u2019t at all\u2014and robs Lomax of several touches of warmth and humanity, including questions asked by Ruby Terrill and John Lomax.\" Gray, Michael (2009).

Chicago Review Press. p. 273.</ref>\n\nMcTell recorded for [[Atlantic Records]] and [[Regal Records (1949)|Regal Records]] in 1949, but these recordings met with less commercial success than his previous works. He continued to perform around Atlanta, but his career was cut short by ill health, mostly due to [[diabetes]] and alcoholism. In 1956, an Atlanta record store manager, Edward Rhodes, discovered McTell playing in the street for quarters and enticed him with a bottle of corn liquor into his store, where he captured a few final performances on a tape recorder. These recordings were released posthumously by Prestige/[[Bluesville Records]] as ''Last Session''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bluesnet.hub.org/readings/mctell.html|title=Blind Willie McTell|publisher=bluesnet|accessdate=November 17, 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100420180950/http://bluesnet.hub.org/readings/mctell.html|archivedate=April 20, 2010|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Beginning in 1957, McTell was a preacher at Mt.

Given the wide range of practices, some of which may be engaged in by people who do not consider themselves as practicing BDSM, inclusion in the BDSM community or subculture is usually dependent upon [[self-identification]] and shared experience.\n\n[[File:BDSM acronym.svg|thumb|The BDSM initialism.]]\nThe term \"BDSM\" is first recorded in a [[Usenet]] posting from 1991,<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/14168#eid289098363|title = BDSM ''n.''

BDSM is now used as a catch-all phrase covering a wide range of activities, forms of [[interpersonal relationship]]s, and distinct subcultures. BDSM communities generally welcome anyone with a non-normative streak who identifies with the community; this may include [[cross-dresser]]s, [[body modification]] enthusiasts, [[animal roleplay]]ers, [[rubber fetishism|rubber fetishists]], and others.\n\nActivities and relationships within a BDSM context are often characterized by the participants taking on complementary, but unequal roles; thus, the idea of [[Consent (BDSM)|informed consent]] of both the partners is essential. The terms \"submissive\" and \"dominant\" are often used to distinguish these roles: the dominant partner (\"dom\") takes psychological control over the submissive (\"sub\"). The terms \"top\" and \"bottom\" are also used: the top is the instigator of an action while the bottom is the receiver of the action. The two sets of terms are subtly different: for example, someone may choose to act as bottom to another person, for example, by being whipped, purely recreationally, without any implication of being psychologically dominated by them, or a submissive may be ordered to massage their dominant partner.  Despite the bottom performing the action and the top receiving they have not necessarily switched roles.\n\nThe abbreviations \"sub\" and \"dom\" are frequently used instead of \"submissive\" and \"dominant\". Sometimes the female-specific terms \"mistress\", \"domme\" or \"[[dominatrix]]\" are used to describe a dominant woman, instead of the gender-neutral term \"dom\". Individuals who can change between top/dominant and bottom/submissive roles\u2014whether from relationship to relationship or within a given relationship\u2014are known as ''[[Top, bottom, switch (BDSM)#Switch|switches]]''. The precise definition of roles and self-identification is a common subject of debate within the community.<ref name=\"Terms\">{{cite web|last=Grau|first=Johnson|url=http://www.leathernroses.com/generalbdsm/ssbbfaqdefines.htm|title=What do B&D, S&M, D&S, \"top\", \"bottom\" mean|publisher=Leather Roses|date=1995|accessdate=27 January 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080111223259/http://www.leathernroses.com/generalbdsm/ssbbfaqdefines.htm| archivedate= 11 January 2008 | deadurl= no}}</ref>\n\n== Fundamentals ==\n\n[[File:Man Cuffed to Bedrail.jpg|thumb|upright|A man handcuffed to a bed and blindfolded.]]\n\n\"BDSM\" is an umbrella term for certain kinds of erotic behavior between consenting adults. There are distinct [[subculture]]s under this umbrella term. Terminology for roles varies widely among the subcultures. ''[[Top (BDSM)|Top]]'' and ''[[Top (BDSM)|dominant]]'' are widely used for those partner(s) in the relationship or activity who are, respectively, the physically active or controlling participants. ''[[Bottom (BDSM)|Bottom]]'' and ''[[Bottom (BDSM)|submissive]]'' are widely used for those partner(s) in the relationship or activity who are, respectively, the physically receptive or controlled participants. The interaction between tops and bottoms\u2014where physical or mental control of the bottom is surrendered to the top\u2014is sometimes known as \"power exchange\", whether in the context of an encounter or a relationship.<ref name=\"bdsmdict\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.xeromag.com/fvbdglossary.html |title=Dictionary of BDSM Terms |accessdate=26 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nBDSM actions can often take place during a specific period of time agreed to by both parties, referred to as \"play\", a \"scene\", or a \"session\". Participants usually derive pleasure from this, even though many of the practices\u2014such as inflicting pain or [[erotic humiliation|humiliation]] or being restrained \u2014 would be unpleasant under other circumstances. Explicit [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]], such as [[sexual penetration]], may occur within a session, but is not essential.<ref name='sexual'>{{Cite book |first1=Phillip |last1=Miller |first2=Molly |last2=Devon |first3=William A. |last3=Granzig |title=Screw the Roses, Send Me the Thorns: The Romance and Sexual Sorcery of Sadomasochism |page=55 |publisher=Mystic Rose Books |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-9645960-0-9}}</ref> Such explicit sexual interaction is, for legal reasons, seen only rarely in public play spaces, and it is sometimes specifically banned by the rules of a party or playspace. Whether it is a public \"playspace\"\u2014ranging from a party at an established community dungeon to a hosted play \"zone\" at a nightclub or social event\u2014the parameters of allowance can vary. Some have a policy of [[panties]]/[[nipple sticker]] for women (underwear for men) and some allow full [[nudity]] with explicit sexual interaction allowed.<ref name=\"bdsmdict\" />\n\n[[File:Caged woman.jpg|thumb|upright|A caged woman at [[Folsom Street Fair]], USA. The red marks on her body are from consensual whipping done at the Fair.]]\nThe fundamental principles for the exercise of BDSM require that it should be performed with the informed consent of all involved parties. Since the 1980s, many practitioners and organizations have adopted the motto (originally from the statement of purpose of GMSMA\u2014a gay SM activist organization) \"[[safe, sane and consensual]]\", commonly abbreviated as \"SSC\", which means that everything is based on safe activities, that all participants be of sufficiently sound/sane mind to consent, and that all participants do consent.<ref>Bill Henkin, Sybil Holiday: Consensual Sadomasochism : How to Talk About It and How to Do It Safely, Page 64, Publisher: Daedalus Publishing Company 2006, {{ISBN|978-1-881943-12-9}}</ref> It is mutual consent that makes a clear legal and ethical distinction between BDSM and such crimes as sexual assault or [[domestic violence]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://sexsupport.org/abusevsere.html|title = VICSS / Difference between Abuse and Power Exchange by the NLA, Dutch SM Media Information Center and Powerrotics|accessdate = 10 December 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071216091307/https://sexsupport.org/abusevsere.html| archivedate= 16 December 2007 | deadurl= no}}</ref>\n\nSome BDSM practitioners prefer a code of behavior that differs from \"SSC\" and is described as \"[[risk-aware consensual kink]]\" (RACK), indicating a preference for a style in which the ''individual'' responsibility of the involved parties is emphasized more strongly, with each participant being responsible for his or her own well-being. Advocates of RACK argue that SSC can hamper discussion of risk because no activity is truly \"safe\", and that discussion of even low-risk possibilities is necessary for truly informed consent. They further argue that setting a discrete line between \"safe\" and \"not-safe\" activities ideologically denies consenting adults the right to evaluate risks vs rewards for themselves; that some adults will be drawn to certain activities regardless of the risk; and that BDSM play\u2014particularly higher-risk play or [[edgeplay]]\u2014should be treated with the same regard as extreme sports, with both respect and the demand that practitioners educate themselves and practice the higher-risk activities to decrease risk. RACK may be seen as focusing primarily upon awareness and informed consent, rather than accepted safe practices.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.withinreality.com/rackssc.html|title = Rack vs. SSC|accessdate = 13 November 2006|year = 2003|website = Within Reality}}</ref> Consent is the most important criterion here. The consent and compliance for a sadomasochistic situation can be granted only by people who can judge the potential results. For their consent, they must have relevant information (extent to which the scene will go, potential risks, if a safeword will be used, what that is, and so on) at hand and the necessary mental capacity to judge. The resulting consent and understanding is occasionally summarized in a written \"[[Contract (BDSM)|contract]]\", which is an agreement of what can and cannot take place.<ref>Dossie Easton, Janet W. Hardy: The New Topping Book, Greenery Press (CA) 2002, {{ISBN|978-1-890159-36-8}}</ref>\n\nIn general, BDSM play is usually structured such that it is possible for the consenting partner to withdraw his or her consent at any point during a scene;<ref>Dossie Easton, Janet W. Hardy: The New Topping Book. Page 72, Greenery Press (CA) 2002, {{ISBN|978-1-890159-36-8}}</ref> for example, by using a [[safeword]] that was agreed on in advance.<ref name=sm101>{{Cite book |authorlink=Jay Wiseman |last=Wiseman |first=Jay |title=SM 101: A Realistic Introduction |publisher=Greenery Press |location=California |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-9639763-8-3 }}</ref><ref>Dossie Easton, Janet W. Hardy: The New Topping Book. Page 71, Greenery Press (CA) 2002</ref> Use of the agreed safeword (or occasionally a \"safe symbol\" such as dropping a ball or ringing a bell, especially when speech is restricted) is seen by some as an explicit withdrawal of consent. Failure to honor a safeword is considered serious misconduct and could even change the sexual consent situation into a crime, depending on the relevant law,<ref name=sm101 /> since the bottom or top has explicitly revoked his or her consent to any actions that follow the use of the safeword (see [[BDSM#Legal status|Legal status]]). For other scenes, particularly in established relationships, a safeword may be agreed to signify a warning (\"this is getting too intense\") rather than explicit withdrawal of consent; and a few choose not to use a safeword at all.\n\n=== Terminology and subtypes ===\n[[File:Bondage model and rigger at BoundCon 2015 custom photoshoot 8.jpg|thumb|A male [[bondage rigger]] demonstrates to the audience on how to do [[rope bondage]], at [[BoundCon]] 2015 event in Germany.

Individual tastes and preferences in the area of [[human sexuality]] may overlap among these areas, which are discussed separately here.\n\nBondage and discipline are two aspects of BDSM that do not seem to relate to each other because of the type of activities involved, but they have conceptual similarities, and that is why they appear jointly. Contrary to the other two types, B&D does not define the tops and bottoms itself, and is used to describe the general activities with either partner being the receiver and the giver.<ref name=\"Zakfar, A Professional Dominatrix 2010\">Zakfar, A Professional Dominatrix, 2010, Lulu.com, {{ISBN|978-0-557-64184-0}}.</ref>\n\nThe term ''bondage'' describes the practice of physical restraint.

Sadism describes sexual pleasure derived by inflicting [[pain]], degradation, humiliation on another person or causing another person to suffer. On the other hand, the masochist enjoys being hurt, humiliated, or suffering within the consensual scenario.<ref name=\"bdsmdict\" /> Sadomasochistic scenes sometimes reach a level that appear more extreme or cruel than other forms of BDSM\u2014for example, when a masochist is brought to tears or is severely bruised\u2014and is occasionally unwelcome at BDSM events or parties.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} Sadomasochism does not imply enjoyment through causing or receiving pain in other situations (for example, accidental injury, medical procedures).{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n[[File:Sade (van Loo).png|thumb|upright=0.7|left|''Portrait of [[Marquis de Sade]]'' by [[Charles-Am\u00e9d\u00e9e-Philippe van Loo]] (1761).]]\nThe terms ''sadism'' and ''masochism'' are derived from the names of the [[Marquis de Sade]] and [[Leopold von Sacher-Masoch]], based on the content of the authors' works.

This led to the first time use of the compound term ''sado-masochism'' (German ''sado-masochismus'') by the Viennese psychoanalytic [[Isidor Isaak Sadger]] in their work, ''\u00dcber den sado-masochistischen Komplex'' (\"Regarding the sadomasochistic complex\") in 1913.<ref>Isidor Isaak Sadger: ''\u00dcber den sado-masochistischen Komplex''. in: Jahrbuch f\u00fcr psychoanalytische und psychopathologische Forschungen, Bd. 5, 1913, S. 157\u2013232 (German)</ref>\n\nIn the later 20th century, BDSM activists have protested against these conceptual models, as they were derived from the philosophies of two singular historical figures.

The bottom is frequently the partner who specifies the basic conditions of the session and gives instructions, directly or indirectly, in the negotiation, while the top often respects this guidance. Other bottoms often called \"brats\" try to incur punishment from their tops by provoking them or \"misbehaving\". Nevertheless, a purist \"school\" exists within the BDSM community, which regards such \"topping from the bottom\" as rude or even incompatible with the standards of BDSM relations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.submissiveguide.com/2009/01/5-ways-to-recognize-topping-from-the-bottom/|title=5 Ways to Recognize Topping from the Bottom|author=lunaKM|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141010090227/http://www.submissiveguide.com/2009/01/5-ways-to-recognize-topping-from-the-bottom/|archivedate=10 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== Types of relationships ===\n;Play\n\nBDSM practitioners sometimes regard the practice of BDSM in their sex life as [[sexual roleplaying|roleplaying]] and so often use the terms \"play\" and \"playing\" to describe activities where in their roles.

It is also common in personal relationships to use the term \"kink play\" for BDSM activities, or more specific terms for the type of activity. The relationships can be of varied types.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Makai|first1=Michael|title=Domination & Submission: The BDSM Relationship Handbook|date=September 2013|publisher=Createspace|isbn=978-1492775973}}</ref>\n\n;Long term\nEarly writings on BDSM both by the academic and BDSM community spoke little of long-term relationships with some in the gay leather community suggesting short-term play relationships to be the only feasible relationship models, and recommending people to get married and \"play\" with BDSM outside of marriage. In recent times though writers of BDSM and sites for BDSM have been more focused on long-term relationships.\n\nA 2003 study, the first to look at these relationships, fully demonstrated that \"quality long-term functioning relationships\" exist among practitioners of BDSM, with either sex being the top or bottom (homosexual couples were not looked at).<ref>{{Harvnb|Cutler|2003|pp=99}}</ref> Respondents in the study expressed their BDSM orientation to be built into who they are, but considered exploring their BDSM interests an ongoing task, and showed flexibility and adaptability in order to match their interests with their partners.<ref name=autogenerated4>{{Harvnb|Cutler|2003|pp=102}}</ref> The \"perfect match\" where both in the relationship shared the same tastes and desires was rare, and most relationships required both partners to take up or put away some of their desires.<ref name=autogenerated4 /> The BDSM activities that the couples partook in varied in sexual to nonsexual significance for the partners who reported doing certain BDSM activities for \"couple bonding, stress release, and spiritual quests\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Cutler|2003|pp=103}}</ref> The most reported issue amongst respondents was not finding enough time to be in role with most adopting a lifestyle wherein both partners maintain their dominant or submissive role throughout the day.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{Harvnb|Cutler|2003|pp=104}}</ref>\n\nAmongst the respondents, it was typically the bottoms who wanted to play harder, and be more restricted into their roles when there was a difference in desire to play in the relationship.<ref name=autogenerated2 /><ref name=autogenerated3>{{Harvnb|Cutler|2003|pp=107}}</ref> The author of the study, Bert Cutler, speculated that tops may be less often in the mood to play due to the increased demand for responsibility on their part: being aware of the safety of the situation and prepared to remove the bottom from a dangerous scenario, being conscious of the desires and limits of the bottom, and so on.<ref name=autogenerated3 /> The author of the study stressed that successful long-term BDSM relationships came after \"early and thorough disclosure\" from both parties of their BDSM interests.<ref name=autogenerated3 />\n\nMany of those engaged in long-term BDSM relationships learned their skills from larger BDSM organizations and communities<ref>{{Harvnb|Cutler|2003|pp=108}}</ref> There was a lot of discussion by the respondents on the amount of control the top possessed in the relationships with almost non-existent discussion of the top \"being better, or smarter, or of more value\" than the bottom.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{Harvnb|Cutler|2003|pp=109}}</ref>\nCouples were generally of the same mind of whether or not they were in an ongoing relationship, but in such cases the bottom was not locked up constantly, but that their role in the context of the relationship was always present, even when the top was doing non-dominant activities such as household chores, or the bottom being in a more dominant position.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> In its conclusion the study states:\n\n<blockquote>The respondents valued themselves, their partners, and their relationships. All couples expressed considerable goodwill toward their partners. The power exchange between the cohorts appears to be serving purposes beyond any sexual satisfaction, including experiencing a sense of being taken care of and bonding with a partner.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cutler|2003|pp=110}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe study further goes on to list three aspects that made the successful relationships work: early disclosure of interests and continued transparency, a commitment to personal growth, and the use of the dominant/submissive roles as a tool to maintain the relationship.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cutler|2003|pp=111}}</ref> In his closing remarks, the author of the study theorizes that due to the serious potential for harm, couples in BDSM relationships develop increased communication that may be higher than in mainstream relationships.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cutler|2003|pp=112}}</ref>\n\n;Professional services\nA professional [[dominatrix]] or [[professional dominant]], often referred to within the culture as a \"pro-dom(me)\", offers services encompassing the range of bondage, discipline, and dominance in exchange for money. The term \"dominatrix\" is little-used within the non-professional BDSM scene. A non-professional dominant woman is more commonly referred to simply as a \"domme\", \"dominant\", or \"[[femdom]]\" (short for female dominance). There are also services provided by professional female submissives (\"pro-subs\"). A professional submissive consents to her client's dominant behavior within negotiated limits, and often works within a professional [[dungeon (BDSM)|dungeon]].

A BDSM activity can, but need not, involve [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]] or [[sexual roleplay]]. A characteristic of many [[BDSM relationship]]s is the [[Power exchange (BDSM)|power exchange]] from the bottom to the dominant partner, and bondage features prominently in BDSM scenes and sexual roleplay.\n\n'The Scene' (including use of the definite article 'the') is also used in the BDSM community to refer to the BDSM community as a whole. Thus someone who is on 'the Scene', and prepared to play in public, might take part in 'a scene' at a public [[Play party (BDSM)|play party]].<ref>*{{cite book|ref = harv|last = Aggrawal|first = Anil|year = 2008|title = Forensic and Medico-Legal Aspects of Sexual Crimes and Unusual Sexual Practices|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=uNkNhPZQprcC&dq|publisher  = CRC Press|isbn = 978-1-4200-4308-2|accessdate = 5 July 2010}} P.147-148, 154, 172, 174</ref>\n\nA scene can take place in private between two or more people, and can involve a domestic arrangement, such as [[servitude (BDSM)|servitude]] or a casual or committed lifestyle [[Master/slave (BDSM)|master/slave relationship]]. BDSM elements may involve settings of [[Master/slave (BDSM)#Slave training|slave training]] or punishment for breaches of instructions.\n\nA scene can also take place in a club, where the [[Play (BDSM)|play]] can be viewed by others. When a scene takes place in a public setting, it may be because the participants enjoy being watched by others, or because of the [[bondage equipment|equipment]] available, or because having third parties present adds safety for play partners who have only recently met.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.novad.org/Primer/Definitions.html |title=Definition of Terms |accessdate=2012-01-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120101092731/http://www.novad.org/Primer/Definitions.html |archivedate=1 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }} Novad Primer Definitions</ref>\n\n=== Etiquette ===\nStandard social etiquette rules still apply when at a BDSM event, such as not intimately touching someone you do not know, not touching someone else's belongings (including toys), and abiding by dress codes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dominantguide.com/325/basics-of-dungeon-etiquette/ |title=Basics of Dungeon Etiquette|date=29 April 2013|author=Rev|website=Dominant Guide|accessdate=5 December 2016}}</ref> Many events open to the public also have rules addressing alcohol consumption, recreational drugs, cell phones, and photography.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rascal's Club Rules|url=http://www.rascals-club.com/rules.html|website=Rascal's Club|accessdate=25 May 2018|language=English}}</ref>\n\nA specific scene takes place within the general conventions and [[etiquette]] of BDSM, such as requirements for mutual [[Consent (BDSM)|consent]] and agreement as to the [[Limits (BDSM)|limits]] of any BDSM activity. This agreement can be incorporated into a [[Contract (BDSM)|formal contract]].

The parties show similarities with ones in the [[dark culture]], being based on a more or less strictly enforced [[dress code]]; most often clothing made of latex, leather or vinyl/PVC, lycra and so on., emphasizing the body's shape and the primary and secondary sexual characteristic. The requirement for such dress codes differ. While some events have none, others have a policy in order to create a more coherent atmosphere and to prevent onlookers from taking part.<ref>[http://www.datenschlag.org/txt/smpabes.html datenschlag.org] (German)</ref>\n\nAt these parties, BDSM can be publicly performed on a stage, or more privately in separate \"dungeons\".<ref>Dossie Easton, Janet W. Hardy: ''The New Topping Book''. Page 163</ref> A reason for the relatively fast spread of this kind of event is the opportunity to use a wide range of \"playing equipment\", which in most apartments or houses is unavailable. Slings, St. Andrew's crosses (or similar restraining constructs), spanking benches, and punishing supports or cages are often made available. The problem of noise disturbance is also lessened at these events, while in the home setting many BDSM activities can be limited by this factor. In addition, such parties offer both [[Exhibitionism|exhibitionists]] and [[Voyeurism|voyeurs]] a forum to indulge their inclinations without social criticism. Sexual intercourse is not permitted within most public BDSM play spaces or not often seen in others, because it is not the emphasis of this kind of play. In order to ensure the maximum safety and comfort for the participants certain standards of behavior have evolved; these include aspects of [[courtesy]], [[privacy]], respect and safewords.<ref name=sm101 /> Today BDSM parties are taking place in most of the larger cities in the Western world.\n\nThis scene appears particularly on the Internet, in publications, and in meetings such as at [[fetish club]]s (like [[Torture Garden (fetish club)|Torture Garden]]), SM parties, gatherings called [[Munch (BDSM)|munches]], and erotic fairs like [[Venus Berlin]].

For some, taking on a role of compliance or helplessness offers a form of therapeutic escape; from the stresses of life, from responsibility, or from guilt. For others, being under the power of a strong, controlling presence may evoke the feelings of safety and protection associated with childhood. They likewise may derive satisfaction from earning the approval of that figure ''(see: [[Servitude (BDSM)]])''. A sadist, on the other hand, may enjoy the feeling of power and authority that comes from playing the dominant role, or receive pleasure vicariously through the suffering of the masochist. It is poorly understood, though, what ultimately connects these emotional experiences to sexual gratification, or how that connection initially forms.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\nJoseph Merlino, author and psychiatry adviser to the ''[[New York Daily News]]'', said in an interview that a sadomasochistic relationship, as long as it is consensual, is not a psychological problem:\n{{quote|It's a problem only if it is getting that individual into difficulties, if he or she is not happy with it, or it's causing problems in their personal or professional lives. If it's not, I'm not seeing that as a problem. But assuming that it did, what I would wonder about is what is his or her biology that would cause a tendency toward a problem, and dynamically, what were the experiences this individual had that led him or her toward one of the ends of the spectrum.<ref>[[n:Dr. Joseph Merlino on sexuality, insanity, Freud, fetishes and apathy#Gender identity and Heteronormativity|Interview with Dr. Joseph Merlino]], David Shankbone, ''[[Wikinews]]'', October 5, 2007.</ref>}}\nIt is agreed on by some psychologists that experiences during early [[Psychosexual development|sexual development]] can have a profound effect on the character of sexuality later in life. Sadomasochistic desires, however, seem to form at a variety of ages. Some individuals report having had them before puberty, while others do not discover them until well into adulthood. According to one study, the majority of male sadomasochists (53%) developed their interest before the age of 15, while the majority of females (78%) developed their interest afterwards (Breslow, Evans, and Langley 1985). The prevalence of sadomasochism within the general population is unknown. Despite female sadists being less visible than males, some surveys have resulted in comparable amounts of sadistic fantasies between females and males.<ref name=\"Fedoroff640\">{{harvnb|Fedoroff|2008|p=640}}: \"...surveys have found no difference in frequency of sadistic fantasies in men and women.\"</ref> The results of such studies demonstrate that one's sex does not determine preference for sadism.<ref name=\"Fedoroff644\">{{harvnb|Fedoroff|2008|p=644}}: \"This review indicates that sexual sadism, as currently defined, is a heterogeneous phenomenon.\"</ref>\n\nFollowing a phenomenological study of nine individuals involved in sexual masochistic sessions who regarded pain as central to their experience,<ref>Kurt, H., & Ronel, N.

It was also demonstrated how the first masochistic experience is placed on a pedestal, with subsequent use aiming at retrieving this lost sensation, much as described in the descriptive literature on addiction.

The German [[Bundesvereinigung Sadomasochismus]] is committed to the same aim of providing information and driving press relations. In 1996 the website and mailing list [[Datenschlag]] went online in German and English providing the largest [[bibliography]], as well as one of the most extensive historical collections of sources related to BDSM.\n\n=== Social (non-medical) research ===\nRichters et al. (2008) study also found that people who engaged in BDSM were more likely to have experienced a wider range of sexual practices (e.g. [[Oral sex|oral]] or [[anal sex]], more than one partner, [[group sex]], [[phone sex]], viewed [[pornography]], used a [[sex toy]], [[fisting]], [[Anilingus|rimming]], etc.). They were, however, not any more likely to have been coerced, unhappy,  anxious, or experiencing [[Sexual dysfunction|sexual difficulties]]. On the contrary, men who had engaged in BDSM scored lower on a psychological distress scale than men who did not.<ref name=\"a2\" />\n\nThere have been few studies on the psychological aspects of BDSM using modern scientific standards. Psychotherapist [[Charles Allen Moser|Charles Moser]] has said there is no evidence for the theory that BDSM has common symptoms or any common psychopathology, emphasizing that there is no evidence that BDSM practitioners have any special psychiatric other problems based on their sexual preferences.<ref name=\"moser\" />\n\nProblems do sometimes occur in the area of self classification by the person concerned. During the phase of the \"coming-out\", self-questioning related to one's own \"normality\" is quite common. According to Moser, the discovery of BDSM preferences ''can'' result in fear of the current non-BDSM relationship's destruction. This, combined with the fear of discrimination in everyday life, leads in some cases to a double life which can be highly burdensome. At the same time, the denial of BDSM preferences can induce stress and dissatisfaction with one's own \"vanilla\"-lifestyle, feeding the apprehension of finding no partner. Moser states that BDSM practitioners having problems finding BDSM partners would probably have problems in finding a non-BDSM partner as well. The wish to remove BDSM preferences is another possible reason for psychological problems since it is not possible in most cases. Finally, the scientist states that BDSM practitioners seldom commit violent crimes. From his point of view, crimes of BDSM practitioners usually have no connection with the BDSM components existing in their life. Moser's study comes to the conclusion that there is no scientific evidence, which could give reason to refuse members of this group work- or safety certificates, adoption possibilities, custody or other social rights or privileges. The Swiss psychoanalyst Fritz Morgenthaler shares a similar perspective in his book, ''Homosexuality, Heterosexuality, Perversion'' (1988). He states that possible problems result not necessarily from the non-normative behavior, but in most cases primarily from the real or feared reactions of the social environment towards their own preferences.<ref>Fritz Morgenthaler: ''Homosexuality, Heterosexuality, Perversion'', Analytic, April 1988, {{ISBN|978-0-88163-060-2}}</ref> In 1940 psychoanalyst [[Theodor Reik]] reached implicitly the same conclusion in his standard work ''[[Aus Leiden Freuden.

Masochismus und Gesellschaft'', Fischer, 1983, {{ISBN|978-3-596-26768-2}} (German)</ref>\n\nMoser's results are further supported by a 2008 Australian study by Richters ''et al.'' on the demographic and psychosocial features of BDSM participants. The study found that BDSM practitioners were no more likely to have experienced sexual assault than the control group, and were not more likely to feel unhappy or anxious. The BDSM males reported higher levels of psychological well-being than the controls. It was concluded that \"BDSM is simply a sexual interest or subculture attractive to a minority, not a pathological symptom of past abuse or difficulty with 'normal' sex.\"<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Richters | first1 = J. | last2 = De Visser | first2 = R.

They concluded that \"men more often display an engagement in dominant practices, whereas females take on the submissive part. This result is inline with a recent study about mate preferences that has shown that women have a generally higher preference for a dominant partner than men do (Giebel, Moran, Schawohl, & Weierstall, 2015). Women also prefer dominant men, and even men who are aggressive, for a short-term relationship and for the purpose of sexual intercourse (Giebel, Weierstall, Schauer, & Elbert, 2013)\".<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Weierstall | first1 = Roland | last2 =  Giebel | first2 = Gilda | year = 2017 | title = The Sadomasochism Checklist: A Tool for the Assessment of Sadomasochistic Behavior | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 46 | issue = 3| pages = 735\u2013745 | doi = 10.1007/s10508-016-0789-0 | pmid = 27488306 }}</ref> Similarly, studies on sexual fantasy differences between men and women show the latter prefer submissive and passive fantasies over dominant and active ones, with rape and force being common.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Wilson | first1 = Glenn | year = 2010 | title = The Sex Fantasy Questionnaire: An update | journal = Sexual and Relationship Therapy | volume = 25 | issue = 1| pages = 68\u201372 | doi = 10.1080/14681990903505799 }}</ref>\n\n==== Gender differences in masochistic scripts ====\n[[File:Female whipping two women.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A whipping scene where both dominant and submissives are female, Paris, 1930]]\n\nOne common belief of BDSM and kink is that women are more likely to take on masochistic roles than men. [[Roy Baumeister]] (2010) actually had more male masochists in his study than female, and fewer male dominants than female. The lack of statistical significance in these gender differences suggests that no assumptions should be made regarding gender and masochistic roles in BDSM. One explanation why we might think otherwise lies in our social and cultural ideals about [[femininity]]; masochism may emphasize certain stereotypically feminine elements through activities like [[Feminization (activity)|feminization]] of men and ultra-feminine clothing for women. But such tendencies of the submissive masochistic role should not be interpreted as a connection between it and the stereotypical female role\u2014many masochistic scripts do not include any of these tendencies.<ref name=\"a4\" >{{cite journal | last1 = Baumeister | first1 = R.

Trends also suggested that male masochism included more bondage and oral sex than female (though the data was not significant). Female masochists, on the other hand, experienced greater: frequency in pain, pain as punishment for 'misdeeds' in the relationship context, display humiliation, genital intercourse, and presence of non-participating audiences. The exclusiveness of dominant males in a heterosexual relationship happens because, historically, men in power preferred multiple partners. Finally, Baumeister observes a contrast between the 'intense sensation' focus of male masochism to a more 'meaning and emotion' centred female masochistic script.<ref name=\"a4\" />\n\nPrior argues that although some of these women may appear to be engaging in traditional subordinate or submissive roles, BDSM allows women in both dominant and submissive roles to express and experience personal power through their sexual identities. In a study that she conducted in 2013, she found that the majority of the women she interviewed identified as bottom, [[Female submission|submissive]], captive, or slave/[[sexual slavery (BDSM)|sex slave]]. In turn, Prior was able to answer whether or not these women found an incongruity between their sexual identities and feminist identity. Her research found that these women saw little to no incongruity, and in fact felt that their feminist identity supported identities of submissive and slave. For them these are sexually and emotionally fulfilling roles and identities that, in some cases, feed other aspects of their lives. Prior contends that third wave feminism provides a space for women in BDSM communities to express their sexual identities fully, even when those identities seem counter-intuitive to the ideals of feminism. Furthermore, women who do identify as submissive, sexually or otherwise, find a space within BDSM where they can fully express themselves as integrated, well-balanced, and powerful women.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Prior|first1=Emily|title=Women's Perspectives of BDSM Power Exchange|journal=Electronic Journal of Human Sexuality|date=2013|volume=16|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA365455101&v=2.1&u=txshracd2598&it=r&p=AONE&sw=w&asid=c799ed9c2682c1c57c56ec8c16af7e4d|accessdate=4 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n==== Women in S/M culture ====\n\nLevitt, Moser, & Jamison's 1994 study provides a general, if outdated, description of characteristics of women in the sadomasochistic (S/M) subculture.

The gay men also had higher incomes than the general population, and tended to work in white collar jobs while straight men tended toward blue collar ones. Because there were not enough female respondents (22), no conclusions could be drawn from them.\n\nSexually speaking, the same 2006 study by Nordling et al. found that gay males were aware of their S/M preferences and took part in them at an earlier age, preferring [[Leather subculture|leather]], [[anal sex]], [[rimming]], [[dildo]]s and special equipment or uniform scenes. In contrast, straight men preferred verbal humiliation, mask and blindfolds, [[Gag (BDSM)|gags]], [[Latex and PVC fetishism|rubber/latex]] outfits, [[caning]], [[vaginal sex]], and [[cross-dressing]] among other activities. From the questionnaire, researchers were able to identify four separate sexual themes: [[Hypermasculinity|hyper-masculinity]], giving and receiving pain, physical restriction (i.e. bondage), and psychological humiliation. Gay men preferred activities that tended towards hyper-masculinity while straight men showed greater preference for humiliation. Though there were not enough female respondents to draw a similar conclusion with, the fact that there is a difference in gay and straight men suggests strongly that S/M (and BDSM in general) can not be considered a homogenous phenomenon. As Nordling et al. (2006) puts it, \"People who identify as sadomasochists mean different things by these identifications.\" (54)<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Nordling | first1 = N. | last2 = Sandnabba | first2 = N.

The reasoning behind this is that 'coming-out' had become primarily the territory of the gay and lesbian, with bisexuals feeling the push to be one or the other (and being right only half the time either way). What he found in 2001, was that people in BDSM were open to discussion about the topic of bisexuality and pansexuality and all controversies they bring to the table, but personal biases and issues stood in the way of actively using such labels. A decade later, Lenius (2011) looks back on his study and considers if anything has changed. He concluded that the standing of bisexuals in the BDSM and kink community was unchanged, and believed that positive shifts in attitude were moderated by society's changing views towards different sexualities and orientations. But Lenius (2011) does emphasize that the pansexual promoting BDSM community helped advance greater acceptance of alternative sexualities.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Lenius | first1 = S | year = 2001 | title = Bisexuals and BDSM | url = | journal = [[Journal of Bisexuality]] | volume = 1 | issue = 4| pages = 69\u201378 | doi=10.1300/j159v01n04_06}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Lenius | first1 = S | year = 2011 | title = A Reflection on \"Bisexuals and BDSM: Bisexual People in a Pansexual Community\"\u2014Ten Years Later (and a Preview of the Next Sexual Revolution) | url = | journal = [[Journal of Bisexuality]] | volume = 11 | issue = 4| pages = 420\u2013425 | doi=10.1080/15299716.2011.620466}}</ref>\n\nBrandy Lin Simula (2012), on the other hand, argues that BDSM actively resists gender conforming and identified three different types of BDSM bisexuality: [[Genderqueer|gender-switching]], gender-based styles (taking on a different gendered style depending on gender of partner when playing), and rejection of gender (resisting the idea that gender matters in their play partners). Simula (2012) explains that practitioners of BDSM routinely challenge our concepts of sexuality by pushing the limits on pre-existing ideas of sexual orientation and gender norms. For some, BDSM and kink provides a platform in creating identities that are fluid, ever-changing.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Simula | first1 = B.

There have been many involvements by institutions of political power to marginalize subgroups and sexual minorities.<ref name=\"a3\" /> Mental health professionals have a long history of holding negative assumptions and stereotypes about the BDSM community. Beginning with the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]]-II, Sexual Sadism and Sexual Masochism have been listed as sexually deviant behaviours.

(2006), major themes of biased and inadequate care to BDSM clients are:\n\n* Considering BDSM to be unhealthy\n* Requiring a client to give up BDSM activities in order to continue in treatment\n* Confusing BDSM with abuse\n* Having to educate the therapist about BDSM\n* Assuming that BDSM interests are indicative of past family/spousal abuse\n* Therapists misrepresenting their expertise by stating that they are BDSM-positive when they are not actually knowledgeable about BDSM practices\n\nThese same researchers suggested that therapists should be open to learning more about BDSM, to show comfort in talking about BDSM issues, and to understand and promote \"safe, sane, consensual\" BDSM.<ref name=\"a3\" />\n\nThere has also been research which suggests BDSM can be a beneficial way for victims of sexual assault to deal with their trauma, most notably by Corie Hammers, but this work is limited in scope and to date, has not undergone empirical testing as a treatment.\n\n=== History of behavioral treatment ===\n{{original research section|date=August 2016}}\nBoth terms were introduced to the medical field by German [[psychiatrist]] [[Richard von Krafft-Ebing]] in his 1886 compilation of case studies ''Psychopathia Sexualis''. Pain and physical violence are not essential in Krafft-Ebing's conception, and he defined \"masochism\" (German ''masochismus'') entirely in terms of control.<ref>{{Cite book|last = von Krafft-Ebing |first = Richard |authorlink = Richard von Krafft-Ebing | title = Psychopathia Sexualis |year = 1886 | url = https://archive.org/details/psychopathiasexu00krafuoft |publisher = |page = 131 |chapter = Masochis |quote = [The masochist] is controlled by the idea of being completely and unconditionally subject to the will of a person of the opposite sex; of being treated by this person as by a master, humiliated and abused. This idea is coloured by lustful feeling; the masochist lives in fancies, in which he creates situations of this kind and often attempts to realise them}}</ref> [[Sigmund Freud]], a psychoanalyst and a contemporary of Krafft-Ebing, noted that both were often found in the same individuals, and combined the two into a single dichotomous entity known as \"sadomasochism\" (German ''sadomasochismus'', often abbreviated as ''S&M'' or ''S/M''). This observation is commonly verified in both literature and practice; many sadists and masochists{{Who|date=November 2014}} define themselves as \"[[switch (BDSM)|switchable]]\"\u2014capable of taking pleasure in either role. However it has also been argued (Deleuze, ''Coldness and Cruelty'') that the concurrence of sadism and masochism in Freud's model should not be taken for granted.\n\nFreud introduced the terms \"primary\" and \"secondary\" masochism. Though this idea has come under a number of interpretations, in a primary masochism the masochist undergoes a complete, not just a partial, rejection by the model or courted object (or sadist), possibly involving the model taking a rival as a preferred mate. This complete rejection is related to the death drive (''todestrieb'') in Freud's psychoanalysis. In a secondary masochism, by contrast, the masochist experiences a less serious, more feigned rejection and punishment by the model. Secondary masochism, in other words, is the relatively casual version, more akin to a charade, and most commentators are quick to point out its contrivedness.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nRejection is not desired by a primary masochist in quite the same sense as the feigned rejection occurring within a mutually consensual relationship\u2014or even where the masochist happens to be the one having actual initiative power (this is the confusion of the distinctions of casual appearance and discrete motives which underlies the analyses of [[Deleuze]] and [[Sartre]], for example).{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}{{Original research inline|date=November 2014}} In ''[[Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World]]'', [[Ren\u00e9 Girard]] attempts to resuscitate and reinterpret Freud's distinction of primary and secondary masochism, in connection with his own philosophy.\n\nBoth Krafft-Ebing and Freud assumed that sadism in men resulted from the distortion of the aggressive component of the male sexual instinct. Masochism in men, however, was seen as a more significant aberration, contrary to the nature of male sexuality. Freud doubted that masochism in men was ever a primary tendency, and speculated that it may exist only as a transformation of sadism. Sadomasochism in women received comparatively little discussion, as it was believed that it occurred primarily in men. Both also assumed that masochism was so inherent to female sexuality that it would be difficult to distinguish as a separate inclination.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n[[Havelock Ellis]], in ''Studies in the Psychology of Sex'', argued that there is no clear distinction between the aspects of sadism and masochism, and that they may be regarded as complementary emotional states. He also made the important point that sadomasochism is concerned only with pain in regard to sexual pleasure, and not in regard to cruelty, as Freud had suggested. In other words, the sadomasochist generally desires that the pain be inflicted or received in love, not in abuse, for the pleasure of either one or both participants. This mutual pleasure may even be essential for the satisfaction of those involved.\n\nHere, Ellis touches upon the often paradoxical nature of widely reported consensual S&M practices. It is described as not simply pain to initiate pleasure, but violence\u2014\"or the simulation of involuntary violent acts\"\u2014said to express love. This irony is highly evident in the observation by many, that not only are popularly practiced sadomasochistic activities usually performed at the express request of the masochist, but that it is often the designated masochist who may direct such activities, through subtle emotional cues perceived or mutually understood and consensually recognized by the designated sadist.\n\nIn his essay ''Coldness and Cruelty'', (originally ''Pr\u00e9sentation de Sacher-Masoch'', 1967) [[Gilles Deleuze]] rejects the term \"sadomasochism\" as artificial, especially in the context of the quintessentially modern masochistic work, Sacher-Masoch's ''Venus In Furs''. Deleuze's counterargument is that the tendency toward masochism is based on intensified desire brought on or enhanced by the acting out of frustration at the delay of gratification. Taken to its extreme, an intolerably indefinite delay is 'rewarded' by punitive perpetual delay, manifested as unwavering coldness. The masochist derives pleasure from, as Deleuze puts it, the \"Contract\": the process by which he can control another individual and turn the individual into someone cold and callous. The sadist, in contrast, derives pleasure from the \"Law\": the unavoidable power that places one person below another. The sadist attempts to destroy the [[Id, ego, and super-ego#Ego|ego]] in an effort to unify the [[Id, ego, and super-ego#Id|id]] and [[Id, ego, and super-ego#Super-ego|super-ego]], in effect gratifying the most base desires the sadist can express while ignoring or completely suppressing the will of the ego, or of the conscience. Thus, Deleuze attempts to argue that masochism and sadism arise from such different impulses that the combination of the two terms is meaningless and misleading. A masochist's perception of their own self-subjugating sadistic desires and capacities are treated by Deleuze as reactions to prior experience of sadistic objectification. (E.g. in terms of psychology, compulsively defensive appeasement of pathological guilt feelings as opposed to the volition of a strong free will.) The epilogue of ''Venus In Furs'' shows the character of Severin has become embittered by his experiment in the alleged control of masochism, and advocates instead the domination of women.{{Original research inline|date=November 2014}}\n\nBefore Deleuze, however, [[Sartre]] had presented his own theory of sadism and masochism, at which Deleuze's deconstructive argument, which took away the symmetry of the two roles, was probably directed. Because the pleasure or power in looking at the victim figures prominently in sadism and masochism, Sartre was able to link these phenomena to his famous philosophy of the \"Look of the Other\". Sartre argued that masochism is an attempt by the \"For-itself\" (consciousness) to reduce itself to nothing, becoming an object that is drowned out by the \"abyss of the Other's subjectivity\".<ref>Jean-Paul Sartre, ''[[Being and Nothingness]]''</ref> By this Sartre means that, given that for the \"for-itself\" desire to attain a point of view in which it is both subject and object, one possible strategy is to gather and intensify every feeling and posture in which the self appears as an object to be rejected, tested, and humiliated; and in this way the for-itself strives toward a point of view in which there is only one subjectivity in the relationship, which would be both that of the abuser and the abused. Conversely, Sartre held sadism to be the effort to annihilate the subjectivity of the victim. That means that the sadist is exhilarated by the emotional distress of the victim because they seek a subjectivity that views the victim as both subject and object.\n\nThis argument may appear stronger if it is understood that this \"look of the other\" theory is either only an aspect of the faculties of desire, or somehow its primary faculty. This does not account for the turn that Deleuze took for his own theory of these matters, but the premise of \"desire as 'look'\" is associated with theoretical distinctions always detracted by Deleuze, in what he regarded as its essential error to recognize \"desire as lack\"\u2014which he identified in the philosophical temperament of Plato, Socrates, and [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]]. For Deleuze, insofar as desire is a lack it is reducible to the \"look\".{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nFinally, after Deleuze, [[Ren\u00e9 Girard]] included his account of sado-masochism in ''Things Hidden Since the Foundation of The World'', originally ''Des choses cach\u00e9es depuis la fondation du monde'', 1978, making the chapter on masochism a coherent part of his theory of [[mimetic desire]]. In this view of sado-masochism, the violence of the practices are an expression of a peripheral rivalry that has developed around the actual love-object. There is clearly a similarity to Deleuze, since both in the violence surrounding the memory of mimetic crisis and its avoidance, and in the resistance to affection that is focused on by Deleuze, there is an understanding of the value of the love object in terms of the processes of its valuation, acquisition and the test it imposes on the suitor.{{Original research inline|date=November 2014}}\n\n=== Clinical issues ===\nNichols (2006) compiled some common clinical issues: countertransference, non-disclosure, coming-out, partner/families, and bleed-through.<ref name=\"a1\" >{{cite journal | last1 = Nichols | first1 = M | year = 2006 | title = Psychotherapeutic issues with \"kinky\" clients: Clinical problems, yours and theirs | url = | journal = Journal of Homosexuality | volume = 50 | issue = 2\u20133| pages = 281\u2013300 | doi=10.1300/j082v50n02_14| pmid = 16803768 }}</ref>\n\n[[Countertransference]] is a common problem in clinical settings. Despite having no evidence, therapists may find themselves believing that their client\u2019s pathology is \"self-evident\". Therapists may feel intense disgust and aversive reactions. Feelings of countertransference can interfere with therapy. Another common problem is when clients conceal their sexual preferences from their therapists. This can compromise any therapy. To avoid non-disclosure, therapists are encouraged to communicate their openness in indirect ways with literatures and artworks in the waiting room. Therapists can also deliberately bring up BDSM topics during the course of therapy. With less informed therapists, sometimes they over-focus on clients\u2019 sexuality which detracts from original issues such as family relationships, depression, etc. A special subgroup that needs counselling is the \"newbie\". Individuals just coming out might have internalized shame, fear, and self-hatred about their sexual preferences. Therapists need to provide acceptance, care, and model positive attitude; providing reassurance, [[psychoeducation]], and [[bibliotherapy]] for these clients is crucial. The average age when BDSM individuals realize their sexual preference is around 26 years.<ref name=\"a3\" /> Many people hide their sexuality until they can no longer contain their desires. However, they may have married or had children by this point. Therefore, therapists need to facilitate couple's counselling and disclosure. It is important for therapists to consider fairness to partner and family of clients. In situations when boundaries between roles in the bedroom and roles in the rest of the relationship blurs, a \"bleed-through\" problem has occurred. Therapists need to help clients resolve distress and deal with any underlying problems that led to the initial bleed-through.{{Original research inline|date=December 2014}}\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Origins ===\n[[File:Tomba Della Fustigazione.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[fresco]] in the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] [[Tomb of the Whipping]], fifth century BC.]]\n[[File:Sm2.jpg|thumb|upright|Copper engraving, about 1780.]]\n[[File:\u00c9douard-Henri Avril (8).jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Flagellation scene, illustration to [[Fanny Hill]] by [[\u00c9douard-Henri Avril]], 1907.]]\n\nPractices of BDSM survive from some of the oldest textual records in the world, associated with rituals to the Goddess [[Inanna]] ([[Ishtar]] in [[Akkadian]]).

This concept is that anyone willingly causing \"injury\" to another person is to be punished. In this context though \"injury\" is legally defined as \"anything causing a condition of illness\", and \"illness\" is ill-defined itself in two different legal ways. The first is \"any anatomical or functional alteration of the organism\" (thus technically including little scratches and bruises too); The second is \"a significant worsening of a previous condition relevant to organic and relational processes, requiring any kind of therapy\". This could make it somewhat risky to play with someone as later the \"victim\" may call foul play citing even an insignificant mark as evidence against the partner. Also any injury requiring over 20 days of medical care must be denounced by the professional medic who discovers it, leading to automatic indictment of the person who caused it.<ref>[http://www.ayzad.com/ Ayzad], ''BDSM \u2013 Guida per esploratori dell'erotismo estremo'', Castelvecchi, 2004 {{ISBN|978-88-7615-025-8}}</ref>\n\n=== Nordic countries ===\nIn September 2010 a Swedish court acquitted a 32-year-old man of assault for engaging in consensual BDSM play with a 16-year-old woman (the [[age of consent]] in Sweden is 15).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.se/29302/20100928|title=Man freed in landmark S&M case|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014|date=2010-09-28}}</ref> Norway's legal system has likewise taken a similar position,<ref>[http://www.revisef65.org/loven.html SM og loven] (Norwegian)</ref> that safe and consensual BDSM play should not be subject to criminal prosecution.

Minors (i.e. those under 16) are not subject to punishment for BDSM play as long as the age difference between them is less than three years. Certain practices however require granting consent for light injuries with only those over 18 permitted to give consent. On 1 April 2002 Articles 135 and 197 of the Swiss Criminal Code were tightened to make ownership of ''\"objects or demonstrations [...] which depict sexual acts with violent content\"'' a punishable offense. This law amounts to a general criminalization of sado-masochism since nearly every sado-masochist will have some kind of media which fulfills this criterion.

Many BDSM practitioners cite the legal decision of [[People v.

However, many individual states do criminalize specific BDSM actions within their state borders. Some states specifically address the idea of \"consent to BDSM acts\" within their assault laws, such as the state of New Jersey, which defines \"simple assault\" to be \"a disorderly persons offense unless committed in a fight or scuffle ''entered into by mutual consent'', in which case it is a petty disorderly persons offense\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://njlawman.com/legal%20research/2c.htm|title=New Jersey Criminal Offenses|author=|date=|website=njlawman.com|accessdate=28 November 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104155828/http://njlawman.com/legal%20research/2c.htm|archivedate=4 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[Oregon Ballot Measure 9]] was a [[initiative|ballot measure]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Oregon]] in 1992, concerning sadism, masochism, [[gay rights]], pedophilia, and [[public education]], that drew widespread national attention.

This culture is often viewed as a [[subculture]], mainly because BDSM is often still regarded as \"unusual\" by some of the public. Many people hide their leaning from society since they are afraid of the incomprehension and of social exclusion. It is commonly known in the BDSM culture that there are practitioners living on all continents, but there is no documented evidence for many countries (due to restrictive laws and censorship motivated by politics or religion) except their presence in online BDSM communities and dating sites.{{Original research inline|date=December 2014}}\n\nIn contrast to frameworks seeking to explain sadomasochism through psychological, psychoanalytic, medical or forensic approaches, which seek to categorize behaviour and desires and find a root \"cause\", Romana Byrne suggests that such practices can be seen as examples of \"aesthetic sexuality\", in which a founding physiological or psychological impulse is irrelevant. Rather, sadism and masochism may be practiced through choice and deliberation, driven by certain aesthetic goals tied to style, pleasure, and identity. These practices, in certain circumstances and contexts, can be compared with the creation of art.<ref>Romana Byrne (2013) [https://books.google.com/books/about/Aesthetic_Sexuality.html?id=uccTAgAAQBAJ&redir_esc=y Aesthetic Sexuality: A Literary History of Sadomasochism], New York: Bloomsbury, pp.1-4.</ref>\n\n=== Symbols ===\n[[File:BDSM-rights-flag-Tanos.svg|150px|alt=BDSM Rights Flag colour|thumb|align=left|The BDSM rights flag.]]\n[[File:Leather, Latex, and BDSM pride - Light.svg|150px|thumb|The [[leather pride flag]], a symbol of the BDSM and fetish subculture.]]\n[[File:BDSM logo.svg|130px|thumb|[[Triskelion]]-type BDSM emblem.]]\nOne of the most commonly used symbols of the BDSM community is a derivation of a [[triskelion]] shape within a circle.<ref name=Luminais>{{cite book|last1=Luminais|first1=Misty|title=In the Habit of Being Kinky: Practice and Resistance in a BDSM Community, Texas, USA|date=May 2012|publisher=Washington State University|page=121|url=https://research.wsulibs.wsu.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/2376/4093/Luminais_wsu_0251E_10404.pdf?sequence=1|accessdate=10 November 2014}}</ref>  Various forms of triskele have had many uses and many meanings in many cultures; its BDSM usage derives from the ''Ring of O'' in the classic book ''[[Story of O]]''.

They are three separate items, that are normally associated together.\n\nThe BDSM rights flag, shown to the right, is intended to represent the belief that people whose sexuality or relationship preferences include BDSM practises deserve the same human rights as everyone else, and should not be discriminated against for pursuing BDSM with consenting adults.\n\nThe flag is inspired by the leather pride flag and BDSM emblem, but is specifically intended to represent the concept of BDSM rights and to be without the other symbols' restrictions against commercial use. It is designed to be recognisable by people familiar with either the leather pride flag or BDSM triskelion (or triskele) as \"something to do with BDSM\"; and to be distinctive whether reproduced in full colour, or in black and white (or another pair of colours).<ref name=\"bdsmrights\">{{cite web|title= BDSMrights.com |url=http://www.bdsmrights.com/}}</ref>\n\nBDSM and [[fetish fashion|fetish items and styles]] have been spread widely in western societies' everyday life by different factors, such as [[avant-garde]] fashion, [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]], [[goth subculture]], and science fiction TV series,<ref>Fuentes Rodr\u00edguez, C\u00e9sar: ''Mundo G\u00f3tico''.

With the release of the 1986 film ''[[9\u00bd Weeks]]'', the topic of BDSM was transferred to mainstream cinema. From the 1990s, cinematic representation of alternative sexualities, including BDSM, increased dramatically, as seen in documentary productions such as ''[[Graphic Sexual Horror]]'' (a 2009 film based on the website [[Insex]]), ''[[Kink (film)|Kink]]'' (a 2013 film based on the website [[Kink.com]]), and movies such as ''[[Fifty Shades of Grey (film)|Fifty Shades of Grey]]'' (2015) and its sequels.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Falk|first1=G.|last2=Weinberg|first2=T.S.|title=Sadomasochism and Popular Western Culture|date=1983|publisher=NY Prometheus Books|location=Amherst, NY|pages=137\u2013144}}</ref>\n\n=== Theatre ===\nAlthough it would be possible to establish certain elements related to BDSM in classical theater, not until the emergence of contemporary theatre would some plays have BDSM as the main theme. Exemplifying this are two works: one Austrian, one German, in which BDSM is not only incorporated, but integral to the storyline of the play.\n* ''[[Worauf sich K\u00f6rper kaprizieren]]'', Austria. Peter Kern directed and wrote the script for this comedy which is a present-day adaption of [[Jean Genet]]'s 1950 film, ''[[Un chant d'amour]]''. It is about a marriage in which the wife (film veteran Miriam Goldschmidt) submits her husband (Heinrich Herkie) and the butler (G\u00fcnter Bubbnik) to her sadistic treatment, until two new characters take their places.<ref>[[Der Standard]], edici\u00f3n del 3 September 2006</ref>\n* ''[[Ach, Hilde]]'' (Oh, Hilda), Germany. This play by Anna Schwemmer premiered in Berlin. A young Hilde becomes pregnant, and after being abandoned by her boyfriend she decides to become a professional dominatrix to earn money. The play carefully crafts a playful and frivolous picture of the field of professional dominatrices.<ref>[[BILD]]-Zeitung, Berl\u00edn, 15 March 1998</ref>\n\n=== Literature ===\n{{main|Sadism and masochism in fiction}}\n{{See also|List of BDSM authors}}\nAlthough examples of literature catering to BDSM and fetishistic tastes were created in earlier periods, BDSM literature as it exists today cannot be found much earlier than [[World War II]].\n\nThe word Sadism originates from the works of [[Donatien Alphonse Fran\u00e7ois, Marquis de Sade]], and the word Masochism originates from [[Leopold von Sacher-Masoch]], the author of ''[[Venus in Furs]]''. However, it is worth noting that the Marquis de Sade describes unconsented abuse in his works, such as in ''[[Justine (Sade novel)|Justine]]''. ''Venus in Furs'' describes a consented domme-sub relationship.\n\nA central work in modern BDSM literature is undoubtedly the ''[[Story of O]]'' (1954) by [[Anne Desclos]] under the pseudonym [[Pauline R\u00e9age]].\n\nOther notable works include ''[[9\u00bd Weeks (book)|9\u00bd Weeks]]'' (1978) by [[Elizabeth McNeill]], some works of the writer [[Anne Rice]] (''[[Exit to Eden]]'', and her ''[[The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty|Claiming of Sleeping Beauty]]'' series of books), [[Jeanne de Berg]] (''[[The Image (novel)|L'Image]]'' (1956) dedicated to [[Pauline R\u00e9age]]). Works from the [[Gor]] series by [[John Norman]], and naturally all the works of [[Patrick Califia]], [[Gloria Brame]], the group [[Samois]] and many of the writer [[Georges Bataille]] (Histoire de l'oeil-Story of the Eye, Madame Edwarda, 1937), as well as [[Bob Flanagan]]: ''Slave Sonnets'' (1986), ''Fuck Journal'' (1987), ''A Taste of Honey'' (1990). A common part of many of the poems of [[Pablo Neruda]] is a reflection on feelings and sensations arising from the relations of EPE or erotic exchange of power. The ''[[Fifty Shades trilogy|Fifty Shades]]'' trilogy is a series of very popular erotic romance novels by [[E. L. James]] which involve BDSM; however the novels have been criticized for their inaccurate and harmful depiction of BDSM.\n\nIn the 21st century, a number of prestigious university presses, such as [[Duke University]], [[Indiana University]] and [[University of Chicago]], have published books on BDSM written by professors, thereby lending academic legitimacy to this once taboo topic.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.chronicle.com/article/Scholars-in-Bondage/139251|title=Scholars in Bondage|journal=The Chronicle of Higher Education|date=20 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Art ===\n{{See also|List of BDSM artists|List of BDSM photographers}}\n* In photography: [[Eric Kroll]] and [[Irving Klaw]] (with [[Bettie Page]], the first well-known bondage model), and Japanese photographer [[Araki Nobuyoshi]], whose works are exhibited in several major art museums, galleries and private collections, such as the Baroness Marion Lambert, the world's largest holder of contemporary photographic art.

The bug was regarded as severe, since [[Common Gateway Interface|CGI]] scripts using Bash could be vulnerable, enabling [[arbitrary code execution]].

Bash can execute the vast majority of Bourne shell scripts without modification, with the exception of Bourne shell scripts stumbling into fringe syntax behavior interpreted differently in Bash or attempting to run a system command matching a newer Bash builtin, etc.  Bash command syntax includes ideas drawn from the [[Korn shell]] (ksh) and the [[C shell]] (csh) such as command line editing, [[command history]], the directory stack, the <code>$RANDOM</code> and <code>$PPID</code> variables, and POSIX [[command substitution]] syntax <code>$(\u2026)</code>.\n\nWhen a user presses the [[tab key]] within an interactive command-shell, Bash automatically uses [[command line completion]], since beta version of 2.04<ref>http://www.caliban.org/bash/index.shtml</ref>, to match partly typed program names, filenames and variable names.  The Bash command-line completion system is very flexible and customizable, and is often packaged with functions that complete arguments and filenames for specific programs and tasks.\n\nBash's syntax has many extensions lacking in the Bourne shell. Bash can perform integer calculations (\"arithmetic evaluation\") without spawning external processes. It uses the <code>((\u2026))</code> command and the <code>$((\u2026))</code> variable syntax for this purpose. Its syntax simplifies [[redirection (computing)|I/O redirection]]. For example, it can redirect [[standard out]]put (stdout) and [[Standard error stream|standard error]] (stderr) at the same time using the <code>&></code> operator. This is simpler to type than the Bourne shell equivalent '<code>command > file 2>&1</code>'.  Bash supports [[process substitution]] using the <code><(command)</code> and <code>>(command)</code>syntax, which substitutes the output of (or input to) a command where a filename is normally used.  (This is implemented through ''/proc/fd/'' unnamed pipes on systems that support that, or via temporary [[named pipe]]s where necessary).\n\nWhen using the 'function' keyword, Bash function declarations are not compatible with Bourne/Korn/POSIX scripts (the Korn shell has the same problem when using 'function'), but Bash accepts the same function declaration syntax as the Bourne and Korn shells, and is POSIX-conformant. Because of these and other differences, Bash shell scripts are rarely runnable under the Bourne or Korn shell interpreters unless deliberately written with that compatibility in mind, which is becoming less common as Linux becomes more widespread. But in POSIX mode, Bash conforms with POSIX more closely.<ref name=\"GNUBASHREF\">\n{{Citation\n  | title = The GNU Bash Reference Manual, for Bash, Version 4.1\n  | place =\n  | publisher =\n  | origyear =\n  | date = December 23, 2009\n  | volume =\n  | edition =\n  | chapter = 6.11 Bash POSIX Mode\n  | chapterurl = https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Bash-POSIX-Mode.html\n  | accessdate = October 26, 2010\n\n  | url = https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/index.html\n| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101203065400/https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/index.html| archivedate= December 3, 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}\n</ref>\n\nBash supports [[here document]]s.

The results of each expanded string are not sorted and left to right order is preserved:\n\n<source lang=\"console\">\n$ echo a{p,c,d,b}e\nape ace ade abe\n$ echo {a,b,c}{d,e,f}\nad ae af bd be bf cd ce cf\n</source>\nUsers should not use brace expansions in portable shell scripts, because the [[Bourne shell]] does not produce the same output.\n\n<source lang=\"console\">\n$ # A traditional shell does not produce the same output\n$ /bin/sh -c 'echo a{p,c,d,b}e'\na{p,c,d,b}e\n</source>\n\nWhen brace expansion is combined with wildcards, the braces are expanded first, and then the resulting wildcards are substituted normally.  Hence, a listing of JPEG and PNG images in the current directory could be obtained using:\n\n<source lang=\"bash\">\nls *.{jpg,jpeg,png}    # expands to *.jpg *.jpeg *.png - after which,\n                       # the wildcards are processed\necho *.{png,jp{e,}g}   # echo just show the expansions -\n                       # and braces in braces are possible.\n</source>\n\nIn addition to alternation, brace expansion can be used for sequential ranges between two integers or characters separated by double dots. Newer versions of Bash allow a third integer to specify the increment.\n\n<source lang=\"console\">\n$ echo {1..10}\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n$ echo file{1..4}.txt\nfile1.txt file2.txt file3.txt file4.txt\n$ echo {a..e}\na b c d e\n$ echo {1..10..3}\n1 4 7 10\n$ echo {a..j..3}\na d g j\n</source>\n\nWhen brace expansion is combined with variable expansion the variable expansion is performed '''after''' the brace expansion, which in some cases may necessitate the use of the <code>eval</code> built-in, thus:\n\n<source lang=\"console\">\n$ start=1; end=10\n$ echo {$start..$end}  # fails to expand due to the evaluation order\n{1..10}\n$ eval echo {$start..$end} # variable expansion occurs then resulting string is evaluated\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n</source>\n\n===Startup scripts===\nWhen Bash starts, it executes the commands in a variety of [[Hidden file and hidden directory#Unix and Unix-like environments|dot files]].  Though similar to Bash shell script commands, which have execute permission enabled and an [[interpreter directive]] like <code>#!/bin/bash</code>, the initialization files used by Bash require neither.\n\n====Execution order of startup files====\n<!-- A little margin for readability -->\n<div style=\"margin: 1.5em 3em\">\n\n=====When started as an interactive login shell=====\nBash reads and executes <code>/etc/profile</code> (if it exists). (Often this file calls <code>/etc/bash.bashrc</code>.)\n\nAfter reading that file, it looks for <code>~/.bash_profile</code>, <code>~/.bash_login</code>, and <code>~/.profile</code> ''in that order'', and reads and executes the first one that exists and is readable.\n\n=====When a login shell exits=====\nBash reads and executes <code>~/.bash_logout</code> (if it exists).\n\n=====When started as an interactive shell (but not a login shell)=====\nBash reads and executes <code>/etc/bash.bashrc</code> and then <code>~/.bashrc</code> (if it exists). This may be inhibited by using the <code>--norc</code> option. The <code>--rcfile file</code> option forces Bash to read and execute commands from <code>file</code> instead of <code>~/.bashrc</code>.\n</div>\n\n====Comparison with the Bourne shell and csh startup sequences====\nElements of Bash derive from the [[Bourne shell]] and [[C shell|csh]]. These allow limited startup file sharing with the Bourne shell and provide some startup features familiar to csh users.\n\n<!-- A little margin for readability -->\n<div style=\"margin: 1.5em 3em\">\n\n=====Setting inheritable environment variables=====\nThe Bourne shell uses the <code>~/.profile</code> at login to set environment variables that subprocesses then inherit. Bash can use the <code>~/.profile</code> in a compatible way, by executing it explicitly from the Bash-specific <code>~/.bash_profile</code> or <code>~/.bash_login</code> with the line below.  Bash-specific syntax can be kept out of the <code>~/.profile</code> to keep the latter compatible with the Bourne shell.\n<source lang=\"bash\">. ~/.profile</source>\n\n=====Aliases and Functions=====\nThese two facilities, [[alias (command)|aliases]] from ''csh'' and the more general functions that largely supersede them from Bourne shell, were not typically inheritable from the login shell, and had to be redefined in each subshell spawned from the login shell.  Although there is an <code>ENV</code> environment variable that could be applied to the problem, both ''csh'' and Bash support per-subshell startup files that address it directly.  In Bash, the <code>~/.bashrc</code> is called for interactive subshells.  If user-defined functions from the <code>~/.bashrc</code> are desired in the login shell as well, the <code>~/.bash_login</code> can include the line below after any setting up of environment variables:\n<source lang=\"bash\">. ~/.bashrc</source>\n\n=====Commands performed only at login and logout=====\nThe ''csh'' supports a <code>~/.login</code> file for purposes of tasks performed only during initial login, such as displaying system load, disk status, whether email has come in, logging the login time, etc.  The Bourne shell can emulate this in the <code>~/.profile</code>, but doesn't predefine a file name.  To achieve similar semantics to the csh model, the <code>~/.bash_profile</code> can contain the line below, after the environment setup and function setup:\n<source lang=\"bash\">. ~/.bash_login</source>\nLikewise, the ''csh'' has a <code>~/.logout</code> file run only when the login shell exits.  The Bash equivalent is <code>~/.bash_logout</code>, and requires no special setup.  In the Bourne shell, the [[Trap_(computing)|<code>trap</code>]] built-in can be used to achieve a similar effect.\n</div>\n\n=====Legacy-compatible Bash startup example=====\nThe skeleton <code>~/.bash_profile</code> below is compatible with the Bourne shell and gives semantics similar to csh for the <code>~/.bashrc</code> and <code>~/.bash_login</code>.  The <code>[ -r ''filename'' ]</code> are tests to see if the ''filename'' exists and is readable, simply skipping the part after the <code>&&</code> if it's not.\n\n<source lang=\"bash\">\n[ -r ~/.profile ] && . ~/.profile             # set up environment, once, Bourne-sh syntax only\nif [ -n \"$PS1\" ] ; then                       # are we interactive?\n   [ -r ~/.bashrc     ] && . ~/.bashrc        # tty/prompt/function setup for interactive shells\n   [ -r ~/.bash_login ] && . ~/.bash_login    # any at-login tasks for login shell only\nfi                                            # End of \"if\" block\n</source>\n\n====Operating system issues in Bash startup====\nSome versions of [[Unix]] and [[Linux]] contain Bash system startup scripts, generally under the <code>/etc</code> directories. Bash calls these as part of its standard initialization, but other startup files can read them in a different order than the documented Bash startup sequence.  The default content of the root user's files may also have issues, as well as the skeleton files the system provides to new user accounts upon setup.  The startup scripts that launch the [[X window system]] may also do surprising things with the user's Bash startup scripts in an attempt to set up user-environment variables before launching the [[window manager]]. These issues can often be addressed using a <code>~/.xsession</code> or <code>~/.xprofile</code> file to read the <code>~/.profile</code> \u2014 which provides the environment variables that Bash shell windows spawned from the window manager need, such as [[xterm]] or [[Gnome Terminal]].\n\n===Portability===\nInvoking Bash with the <code>--posix</code> option or stating <code>set -o posix</code> in a script causes Bash to conform very closely to the [[Posix#POSIX.2|POSIX 1003.2 standard]].<ref name=tldp />\nBash shell scripts intended for [[portability (computer science)|portability]] should at least take into account the Bourne shell it intends to replace. Bash has certain features that the traditional Bourne shell lacks. They include:<ref name=tldp>{{cite web|author=Mendel Cooper|title=Portability Issues|url=http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/portabilityissues.html|work=The Linux Documentation Project|publisher=ibiblio.org}}</ref>\n\n* Certain extended invocation options\n* Command substitution using $( ) notation (this feature is part of the POSIX 1003.2 standard though)\n* Brace expansion\n* Certain array operations, and associative arrays\n* The double brackets extended test construct\n* The double-parentheses arithmetic-evaluation construct\n* Certain string-manipulation operations\n* Process substitution\n* A Regular Expression matching operator\n* Bash-specific builtins\n* [[Coprocess]]es\n\nA \"bashism\" is a portion of bash code that does not run properly on other Unix shells.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://linux.die.net/man/1/checkbashisms|title=checkbashisms(1) - Linux man page|website=linux.die.net}}</ref>\n\n===Keyboard shortcuts===\n{{Main article|GNU Readline}}\nBash uses readline to provide keyboard shortcuts for command line editing using the default ([[Emacs]]) key bindings. [[Vi-binding]]s can be enabled by running <code>set -o vi</code>.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hypexr.org/bash_tutorial.php#emacs |title=BASH Help - A Bash Tutorial |publisher=Hypexr.org |date=October 5, 2012 |accessdate=July 21, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Process management===\nThe Bash shell has two modes of execution for commands: [[batch (Unix) | batch]], and concurrent mode.\n\nTo execute commands in batch (i.e., in sequence) they must be separated by the character \";\", or on separate lines:\n\n<source lang=\"bash\">\ncommand1; command2\n</source>\n\nin this example, when command1 is finished, command2 is executed.\n\nYou can also have a [[background execution]] of command1 using (symbol &) at the end of your execution command, and process will be executed in background returning immediately control to your shell and allowing you to keep executing commands.\n<source lang=\"bash\">command1 &</source>\n\nOr to have a concurrent execution of two command1 and command2, they must be executed in the Bash shell in the following way:\n\n<source lang=\"bash\">\ncommand1 & command2\n</source>\n\nIn this case command1 is executed in the background ''&'' symbol, returning immediately control to the shell that executes command2 in the foreground.\n\nA process can be stopped and returned control to bash by typing {{Key press|Ctrl|z}} while the process is running in the foreground<ref>https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#index-background</ref>.\n\nA list of all processes, both in the background and stopped, can be achieved by running <code>jobs</code>:\n<source lang=\"console\">\n$ jobs\n[1]-  Running                  command1 &\n[2]+  Stopped                  command2\n</source>\n\nIn the output, the number in brackets refers to the job id. The plus sign signifies the default process for <code>bg</code> and <code>fg</code>. The text \"Running\" and \"Stopped\" refer to the [[Process state]]. The last string is the command that started the process. \n\nThe state of a process can be changed using various commands. The <code>fg</code> command brings a process to the foreground, while the <code>bg</code> sets a stopped process running in the background. <code>bg</code> and <code>fg</code> can take a job id as their first argument, to specify the process to act on. Without one, they use the default process, identified by a plus sign in the output of <code>jobs</code>. The <code>[[Kill_(command)|kill]]</code> command can be used to end a process prematurely, by sending it a [[Signal (IPC)|signal]]. The job id must be specified after a percent sign:\n\n<source lang=\"bash\">\nkill -s SIGKILL %1 or kill -9 %1\n</source>\n\n===Conditional execution===\nBash supplies \"conditional execution\" command separators that make execution of a command contingent on the [[Exit status|exit code]] set by a precedent command. For example:\n\n<source lang=\"bash\">\ncd \"$SOMEWHERE\" && ./do_something || echo \"An error occurred\" >&2\n</source>\n\nWhere ''./do_something'' is only executed if the ''cd'' (change directory) command was \"successful\" (returned an exit status of zero) and the ''echo'' command would only be executed if either the ''cd'' or the ''./do_something'' command return an \"error\" (non-zero exit status).\n\nFor all commands the exit status is stored in the special variable <code>$?</code>.  Bash also supports {{code|2=bash|if ...;then ...;else ...;fi}} and {{code|2=bash|case $VARIABLE in $pattern)...;;$other_pattern)...;; esac}} forms of conditional command evaluation.\n\n===Bug reporting===\n{{Redirect|bashbug|the widely reported September 2014 bug found in Bash|Shellshock (software bug)}}\nAn external command called ''bashbug'' reports Bash shell bugs. When the command is invoked, it brings up the user's default editor with a form to fill in. The form is mailed to the Bash maintainers (or optionally to other email addresses).<ref>\n[http://linux.die.net/man/1/bashbug bashbug(1)], die.net\n</ref><ref>\n[https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/bashbug.1.html \"Linux / Unix Command: bashbug\"], apple.com\n</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Free software}}\n* [[Comparison of command shells]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|GNU Bash|Bash}}\n{{Wikibooks|Bash Shell Scripting}}\n* {{official website|https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/}}\n* [http://www.computerworld.com.au/article/222764/ 2008 interview with GNU Bash's maintainer, Chet Ramey]\n* [https://github.com/lanl/MPI-Bash MPI-Bash]: A [[Message_Passing_Interface|MPI]]-enabled plugin for the Bourne-Again Shell by [[Scott Pakin]]\n\n{{GNU}}\n{{Unix shells}}{{Programming languages}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bash (Unix Shell)}}\n[[Category:1989 software]]\n[[Category:Cross-platform free software]]\n[[Category:Domain-specific programming languages]]\n[[Category:Free software programmed in C]]\n[[Category:GNU Project software]]\n[[Category:Scripting languages]]\n[[Category:Text-oriented programming languages]]\n[[Category:Unix shells]]", "sha1": "ht2fffa95lkh0ol8pvov2ox6vv5pdtm"}}, {"title": "Blizzard", "ns": "0", "id": "4548", "revision": {"id": "866294348", "parentid": "866294275", "timestamp": "2018-10-29T14:00:04Z", "contributor": {"username": "Theinstantmatrix", "id": "31567860"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Reverted edits by [[Special:Contribs/50.206.215.94|50.206.215.94]] ([[User talk:50.206.215.94|talk]]) to last version by ClueBot NG", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Other uses}}\n{{Infobox weather type\n|name=Blizzard\n|image=Blizzard1 - NOAA.jpg\n|caption=A blizzard in [[Goodland, Kansas]].\n|area of occurrence= [[Temperate]] and [[Polar regions of Earth|polar]] regions, [[Alpine climate|high mountains]].\n|season= Usually [[winter]].\n|effect= [[Power outages]], dangerous travel conditions.\n}}\n{{Weather}}\n{{see also|Cold waves}}\n\nA '''blizzard''' is a severe [[Winter storm|snowstorm]] characterized by strong sustained winds of at least {{convert|35|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} and lasting for a prolonged period of time\u2014typically three hours or more. A [[ground blizzard]] is a weather condition where snow is not falling but loose snow on the ground is lifted and blown by strong winds.

The difference between a blizzard and a snowstorm is the strength of the wind, not the amount of snow. To be a blizzard, a snow storm must have sustained winds or frequent gusts that are greater than or equal to {{convert|56|km/h|abbr=on}} with blowing or drifting snow which reduces [[visibility]] to {{convert|400|m|mi|abbr=on|disp=or}} or less and must last for a prolonged period of time\u2014typically three hours or more.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weather.gov/glossary/index.php?letter=b|title=Blizzard at the US National Weather Service glossary |publisher=Weather.gov |date=2009-06-25 |accessdate=2012-08-18}}</ref><ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=http://www.ussartf.org/blizzards.htm|title=Blizzards|website=www.ussartf.org|accessdate=11 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nWhile severe cold and large amounts of [[snowdrift|drifting snow]] may accompany blizzards, they are not required. Blizzards can bring [[Whiteout (weather)|whiteout]] conditions, and can paralyze regions for days at a time, particularly where snowfall is unusual or rare.\n\nA severe blizzard has winds over {{convert|72|km/h|abbr=on}}, near zero visibility, and temperatures of {{convert|-12|C|}} or lower.<ref name=autogenerated2>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/69478/blizzard \"Blizzard\"] ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online'' retrieved 17 March 2012</ref> In [[Antarctica]], blizzards are associated with winds spilling over the edge of the ice plateau at an average velocity of {{convert|160|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}.<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\n[[Ground blizzard]] refers to a weather condition where loose snow or ice on the ground is lifted and blown by strong winds. The primary difference between a ground blizzard as opposed to a regular blizzard is that in a ground blizzard no precipitation is produced at the time, but rather all the precipitation is already present in the form of snow or ice at the surface.\n[[File:Old farm at Overtown in deep snow in 1963.jpg|thumb|Drifted snow near [[Burrow-with-Burrow]], Lancashire, England, January 1963]]\nThe Australia Bureau of [[Meteorology]] describes a blizzard as, \"Violent and very cold wind which is laden with snow, some part, at least, of which has been raised from snow covered ground.\"\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/info/wwords/ |title=Blizzard definition, Weather Words, Australian Government Bureau of Meteorology |publisher=Bom.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2012-08-18}}</ref>\n\nThe ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' concludes the term ''blizzard'' is likely onomatopoeic, derived from the same sense as ''blow, blast, blister, and bluster''; the first recorded use of it for weather dates to 1829, when it was defined as a \"violent blow\". It achieved its modern definition by 1859, when it was in use in the [[western United States]]. The term became common in the press during the harsh winter of 1880\u201381.<ref>{{cite book|title=Entry for Blizzard|publisher=[[Oxford English Dictionary]]|url=http://www.oed.com}}</ref>\n\n==United States storm systems==\n[[File:Duluth blizzard, December 2007.jpg|thumb|Duluth blizzard, December 2007|[[Duluth, Minnesota]] blizzard, March 2007]]\n[[File:Blizzard2 - NOAA.jpg|thumb|March blizzard in North Dakota, 1966.]]\n\nIn the United States, storm systems powerful enough to cause blizzards usually form when the [[jet stream]] dips far to the south, allowing cold, dry polar air from the north to clash with warm, humid air moving up from the south.<ref name=autogenerated1 /><ref>[http://www.weather.com/encyclopedia/winter/blizzard.html weather.com - Storm Encyclopedia<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130211082356/http://www.weather.com/encyclopedia/winter/blizzard.html |date=February 11, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nWhen cold, moist air from the Pacific Ocean moves eastward to the [[Rocky Mountains]] and the [[Great Plains]], and warmer, moist air moves north from the [[Gulf of Mexico]], all that is needed is a movement of cold polar air moving south to form potential blizzard conditions that may extend from the [[Texas Panhandle]] to the [[Great Lakes]] and [[Midwest]]. A blizzard also may be formed when a cold front and warm front mix together and a blizzard forms at the border line.\n\nAnother storm system occurs when a cold core low over the [[Hudson Bay]] area in Canada is displaced southward over southeastern Canada, the Great Lakes, and [[New England]]. When the rapidly moving cold front collides with warmer air coming north from the [[Gulf of Mexico]], strong surface winds, significant cold air [[advection]], and extensive wintry precipitation occur.\n\n[[Image:Nearwhiteoutinminnesota.JPG|thumb|Conditions approaching a blizzard whiteout in [[Minnesota]], on March 1, 2007. Note the unclear horizon near the center.]]\n\n[[Low pressure systems]] moving out of the Rocky Mountains onto the Great Plains, a broad expanse of flat land, much of it covered in [[prairie]], [[steppe]] and [[grassland]], can cause thunderstorms and rain to the south and heavy snows and strong winds to the north. With few trees or other obstructions to reduce wind and blowing, this part of the country is particularly vulnerable to blizzards with very low temperatures and [[whiteout (weather)|whiteout]] conditions. In a true whiteout there is no visible horizon. People can become lost in their own front yards, when the door is only {{convert|10|ft|m|0|order=flip|abbr=on}} away, and they would have to feel their way back.

It gets its name from the direction the wind is coming from. The usage of the term in North America comes from the wind associated with many different types of storms some of which can form in the North Atlantic Ocean and some of which form as far south as the Gulf of Mexico. The term is most often used in the coastal areas of [[New England]] and [[Atlantic Canada]]. This type of storm has characteristics similar to a [[hurricane]]. More specifically it describes a [[low-pressure area]] whose center of [[rotation]] is just off the coast and whose leading winds in the left-forward quadrant rotate onto land from the northeast. High storm waves may sink ships at sea and cause coastal flooding and beach erosion. Notable nor'easters include The [[Great Blizzard of 1888]], one of the worst blizzards in U.S. history. It dropped {{convert|40|-|50|in|cm|order=flip|abbr=on}} of snow and had sustained winds of more than {{convert|45|mph}} that produced snowdrifts in excess of {{convert|50|ft|m}}.

On March 29, 1881, snowdrifts in Minnesota were higher than locomotives.]]\n\nThe winter of 1880\u20131881 is widely considered the most severe winter ever known in parts of the United States. Many children\u2014and their parents\u2014learned of \"The Snow Winter\" through the children's book ''[[The Long Winter (novel)|The Long Winter]]'' by [[Laura Ingalls Wilder]], in which the author tells of her family's efforts to survive. The snow arrived in October 1880 and blizzard followed blizzard throughout the winter and into March 1881, leaving many areas snowbound throughout the entire winter. Accurate details in Wilder's novel include the blizzards' frequency and the deep cold, the [[Chicago and North Western Railway]] stopping trains until the spring thaw because the snow made the tracks impassable, the near-starvation of the townspeople, and the courage of her future husband Almanzo and another man, who ventured out on the open prairie in search of a cache of wheat that no one was even sure existed.\n\nThe October blizzard brought snowfalls so deep that two-story homes had snow up to the second floor windows. No one was prepared for the deep snow so early in the season and farmers all over the region were caught before their crops had even been harvested, their grain milled, or with their fuel supplies for the winter in place. By January the train service was almost entirely suspended from the region. Railroads hired scores of men to dig out the tracks but it was a wasted effort: As soon as they had finished shoveling a stretch of line, a new storm arrived, filling up the line and leaving their work useless.\n\nThere were no winter thaws and on February 2, 1881, a second massive blizzard struck that lasted for nine days. In the towns the streets were filled with solid drifts to the tops of the buildings and tunneling was needed to secure passage about town. Homes and barns were completely covered, compelling farmers to tunnel to reach and feed their stock.\n\nWhen the snow finally melted in late spring of 1881, huge sections of the plains were flooded. Massive ice jams clogged the [[Missouri River]] and when they broke the downstream areas were ravaged. Most of the town of [[Yankton, South Dakota|Yankton]], in what is now South Dakota, was washed away when the river overflowed its banks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2003/winter/little-town-in-nara-2.html|title=Prologue|date=8 March 2012|work=archives.gov}}</ref><ref>{{citation|url=http://files.usgwarchives.net/sd/history/robinson/liii.txt|title=Chapter LIII: Dakota Territory History \u2013 1880\u20131881|work=History of South Dakota|author=Doane Robinson|volume=1|date=1904|p=306\u2013309}}</ref>\n\n===The Storm of the Century===\n[[File:1993 Storm of the Century Asheville, North Carolina snowfall.jpg|thumb|Under the weight of snow, a tree falls next to a car in [[Asheville, North Carolina]]]]\n\nThe [[1993 Storm of the Century|Storm of the Century]], also known as the Great Blizzard of 1993, was a large [[cyclone|cyclonic]] storm that formed over the [[Gulf of Mexico]] on March 12, 1993, and dissipated in the North Atlantic Ocean on March 15.

The massive explosion of the volcano [[1883 eruption of Krakatoa|Krakatoa]] in the South Pacific late in August 1883 is a suspected cause of these huge blizzards during these several years. The clouds of ash it emitted continued to circulate around the world for many years. Weather patterns continued to be chaotic for years, and temperatures did not return to normal until 1888. Record rainfall was experienced in Southern California during July 1883 to June 1884.

January 12\u201313, 1888. What made the storm so deadly was the timing (during work and school hours), the suddenness, and the brief spell of warmer weather that preceded it. In addition, the very strong wind fields behind the cold front and the powdery nature of the snow reduced visibilities on the open plains to zero. People ventured from the safety of their homes to do chores, go to town, attend school, or simply enjoy the relative warmth of the day. As a result, thousands of people\u2014including many schoolchildren\u2014got caught in the blizzard.\n*[[Great Blizzard of 1888|Great Blizzard of March 1888]] March 11\u201314, 1888.

On March 12, an unexpected northeaster hit New England and the mid-Atlantic, dropping up to {{convert|50|in|cm|abbr=on|}} of snow in the space of three days. New York City experienced its heaviest snowfall recorded to date at that time, all street railcars were stranded, and the storm lead to the creation of the NYC subway system. Snowdrifts reached up to the second story of some buildings. Some 400 people died from this blizzard, including many sailors aboard vessels that were beset by gale-force winds and turbulent seas.\n*[[Great Blizzard of 1899]] February 11\u201314, 1899. An extremely unusual blizzard in that it reached into the far southern states of the US. It hit in February, and the area around Washington, D.C., experienced 51 hours straight of snowfall. The port of New Orleans was totally iced over; revelers participating in the New Orleans [[Mardi Gras]] had to wait for the parade routes to be shoveled free of snow. Concurrent with this blizzard was the extremely cold arctic air. Many city and state record low temperatures date back to this event, including all-time records for locations in the Midwest and South.

The morning of the storm was unseasonably warm but by mid afternoon conditions quickly deteriorated into a raging blizzard that would last into the next day. A total of 145 deaths were blamed on the storm, almost a third of them duck hunters who had taken time off to take advantage of the ideal hunting conditions. Weather forecasters had not predicted the severity of the oncoming storm, and as a result the hunters were not dressed for cold weather. When the storm began many hunters took shelter on small islands in the Mississippi River, and the {{convert|50|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} winds and {{convert|5|ft|m|adj=on}} waves overcame their encampments.

It was followed by two more months of blizzard after blizzard with high winds and bitter cold. Deep drifts isolated southeast Wyoming, northern Colorado, western South Dakota and western Nebraska, for weeks. Railroad tracks and roads were all drifted in with drifts of 20 feet and more.  Hundreds of people that had been traveling on trains were stranded.  Motorists that had set out on January 2 found their way to private farm homes in rural areas and hotels and other buildings in towns; some dwellings were so crowded that there wasn't enough room for all to sleep at once.  It would be weeks before they were plowed out. The Federal government quickly responded with aid, airlifting food and hay for livestock.  The total rescue effort involved numerous volunteers and local agencies plus at least ten major state and federal agencies from the U.S. Army to the National Park Service. Private businesses, including railroad and oil companies, also lent manpower and heavy equipment to the work of plowing out.

Babur ruled nearby [[Osh]] in [[Fergana Valley]], located in modern [[Kyrgyzstan]], pondered his future on Sulayman Mountain and even constructed a mosque atop of the mountain. Babur somehow concludes that the confines of the Fergana would cramp his aspirations as a descendant of famous conquering warrior princes. He wrote of the city:\n\n<blockquote>\"There are many sayings about the excellence of Osh. On the southeastern side of the Osh fortress is a well-proportioned mountain called Bara-Koh, where, on its summit, Sultan Mahmud Khan built a pavilion. Farther down, on a spur of the same mountain, I had a porticoed pavilion built in 902 (1496-7)\"<ref>''The Babur-nama'' Ed. & trans. Wheeler M. Thackston (New York) 2002 pp4-5</ref></blockquote>\n\nBabur was the eldest son of [[Umar Sheikh Mirza]], governor of [[Fergana]] and great grandson of Timur the Great. He ascended the throne of Fergana in its capital [[Akhsikent]] in 1494 at the age of twelve and faced rebellion. He conquered [[Samarkand]] two years later, only to lose the vilayat of Fergana soon after. In his attempt to reconquer Fergana, he lost control of Samarkand. In 1501, his attempt to recapture both vilayats went in vain as he was defeated by [[Muhammad Shaybani Khan]]. In 1504, he conquered [[Kabul]], which was under the rule of the infant heir of [[Ulugh Begh]]. Babur formed a partnership with [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] ruler [[Ismail I]] and reconquered parts of [[Turkistan]], including Samarkand, only to again lose it and the other newly conquered lands to the Sheybanids.\n\nAfter losing Samarkand for the third time, Babur turned his attention to the [[South Asia|South]]. At that time, the [[Indo-Gangetic Plain]] of the northern Indian Subcontinent was ruled by [[Ibrahim Lodi]] of the Afghan [[Lodi dynasty]], whereas [[Rajputana]] was ruled by a Hindu [[Rajput|Rajput Confederacy]], led by [[Rana Sanga]] of [[Mewar]]. According to historical records and [[Baburnama]] (autobiography written by Babur himself) [[Daulat Khan Lodi]] invited him to attack on Delhi where [[Ibrahim Lodi]] was ruling at that time. He sent his [[ambassador]] to him to support him in his attack on Delhi. Also in 1524, [[Daulat Khan Lodi]], a rebel of the Lodhi dynasty, invited Babur to overthrow Ibrahim and become ruler. Babur defeated Ibrahim Lodi at the [[First Battle of Panipat]] in 1526 CE and founded the Mughal empire. However, he again faced opposition, this time from Rana Sanga of Mewar and Medini Rai,another rajput ruler in the battle of Chanderi who considered Babur a foreigner. The Rana was defeated in the [[Battle of Khanwa]].\n\nBabur married several times. Notable among his sons are [[Humayun]], [[Kamran Mirza]] and [[Hindal Mirza]]. Babur died in 1530 and was succeeded by Humayun. According to Babur's wishes, he was buried in [[Bagh-e-Babur]] in Kabul, [[Afghanistan]]. Being a patrilineal descendant of Timur, Babur considered himself a Timurid and [[Chagatai Khanate|Chagatai]] [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]].<ref name=\"Richards1995\">{{citation |last=Richards |first=John F. |title=The Mughal Empire |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HHyVh29gy4QC |year=1995 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=6 |isbn=978-0-521-56603-2}}</ref> He is considered a national hero in [[Uzbekistan]] and [[Kyrgyzstan]].

King [[Louis VI of France]] convened a national council of the French bishops at [[\u00c9tampes]] in 1130, and Bernard was chosen to judge between the rivals for pope.   By the end of 1131, the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of France|France]], [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Holy Roman Empire|Germany]], [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], and [[Aragon]] supported Innocent; however, most of Italy, southern France, and [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]], with the Latin patriarchs of [[Constantinople]], [[Antioch]], and [[Jerusalem]] supported Anacletus. Bernard set out to convince these other regions to rally behind Innocent. \n\nIn 1139, Bernard assisted at the [[Second Council of the Lateran]]. He subsequently denounced the teachings of [[Peter Abelard]] to the pope, who called a [[council at Sens]] in 1141 to settle the matter. Bernard soon saw one of his disciples elected [[Pope Eugene III]]. Having previously helped end the schism within the church, Bernard was now called upon to combat heresy. In June 1145, Bernard traveled in southern France and his preaching there helped strengthen support against heresy.\n\nAfter the Christian defeat at the [[Siege of Edessa]], the pope commissioned Bernard to preach the [[Second Crusade]]. The last years of Bernard's life were saddened by the failure of the crusaders, the entire responsibility for which was thrown upon him. Bernard died at the age of 63, after 40 years as a monk. He was the first Cistercian placed on the [[calendar of saints]], and was [[canonized]] by [[Pope Alexander III]] on 18 January 1174. In 1830 [[Pope Pius VIII]] bestowed upon Bernard the title \"[[Doctor of the Church]]\".\n\n==Early life (1090\u20131113)==\nBernard's parents were [[Tescelin de Fontaine]], lord of [[Fontaine-l\u00e8s-Dijon]], and [[:fr:Al\u00e8the (sainte)|Al\u00e8the de Montbard]], both members of the highest nobility of [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]]. Bernard was the third of seven children, six of whom were sons. At the age of nine years, he was sent to a school at [[Ch\u00e2tillon-sur-Seine]] run by the [[secular canons]] of Saint-Vorles. Bernard had a great taste for literature and devoted himself for some time to poetry. His success in his studies won the admiration of his teachers. He wanted to excel in literature in order to take up the study of the [[Bible]]. He had a special devotion to the [[Blessed Virgin Mary (Roman Catholic)|Virgin Mary]], and he would later write several works about the [[Queen of Heaven]].{{sfn|Gildas|1907}}\n\n[[File:Fra bartolomeo 02 Vision of St Bernard with Sts Benedict and John the Evangelist.jpg|thumb|left|''The Vision of St Bernard'', by [[Fra Bartolommeo]], c. 1504 ([[Uffizi]])]]\nBernard would expand upon [[Anselm of Canterbury]]'s role in transmuting the sacramentally ritual Christianity of the [[Early Middle Ages]] into a new, more personally held faith, with the life of Christ as a model and a new emphasis on the Virgin Mary. In opposition to the rational approach to divine understanding that the [[scholastics]] adopted, Bernard would preach an immediate faith, in which the intercessor was the Virgin Mary. He is often cited for saying that St. Mary Magdalene was the Apostle to the Apostles.\n\nBernard was only nineteen years of age when his mother died. During his youth, he did not escape trying temptations and around this time he thought of retiring from the world and living a life of solitude and prayer.{{sfn|Bunson|Bunson|Bunson|1998|p=129}}\n\nIn 1098 Saint [[Robert of Molesme]] had founded [[C\u00eeteaux Abbey]], near [[Dijon]], with the purpose of restoring the [[Rule of St Benedict]] in all its rigour. Returning to Molesme, he left the government of the new abbey to Saint [[Alberic of C\u00eeteaux]], who died in the year 1109. After the death of his mother, Bernard sought admission into the Cistercian order. At the age of 22, while Bernard was at prayer in a church, he felt the calling of God to enter the monastery of C\u00eeteaux.{{sfn|Pirlo|1997}} In 1113 Saint [[Stephen Harding]] had just succeeded Saint Alberic as third [[Abbot of C\u00eeteaux]] when Bernard and thirty other young noblemen of Burgundy sought admission into the monastery.{{sfn|McManners|1990|p=204}} Bernard's testimony was so irresistible that 30 of his friends, brothers, and relatives followed him into the monastic life.{{sfn|Pirlo|1997}}\n\n==Abbot of Clairvaux (1115\u201328)==\n[[File:Jorg Breu Sr St Bernhard Zwettl.jpg|thumb|Bernard exorcising a possession, altarpiece by [[J\u00f6rg Breu the Elder]], c. 1500]]\nThe little community of reformed [[Benedictines]] at [[C\u00eeteaux]], which would have so profound an influence on Western [[monasticism]], grew rapidly. Three years later, Bernard was sent with a band of twelve monks to found a new house at Vall\u00e9e d'Absinthe,{{sfn|Pirlo|1997}} in the [[Diocese of Langres]]. This Bernard named ''Claire Vall\u00e9e'', or ''Clairvaux'', on 25 June 1115, and the names of Bernard and Clairvaux would soon become inseparable.{{sfn|Bunson|Bunson|Bunson|1998|p=129}} During the absence of the [[Bishop of Langres]], Bernard was blessed as [[abbot]] by [[William of Champeaux]], [[Bishop of Ch\u00e2lons-sur-Marne]]. From that moment a strong friendship sprang up between the abbot and the bishop, who was professor of theology at [[Notre Dame of Paris]], and the founder of the [[Abbey of St. Victor, Paris]].{{sfn|Gildas|1907}}\n\nThe beginnings of [[Clairvaux Abbey]] were trying and painful. The regime was so austere that Bernard became ill, and only the influence of his friend William of Champeaux and the authority of the [[Chapter (religion)|general chapter]] could make him mitigate the austerities. The monastery, however, made rapid progress. Disciples flocked to it in great numbers and put themselves under the direction of Bernard. The reputation of his holiness soon attracted 130 new monks, including his own father.{{sfn|Pirlo|1997}} His father and all his brothers entered Clairvaux to pursue religious life, leaving only Humbeline, his sister, in the secular world. She, with the consent of her husband, soon took the veil in the [[Benedictine]] [[nunnery]] of [[Jully-les-Nonnains]]. [[Gerard of Clairvaux]], Bernard's older brother, became the [[Obedientiaries|cellarer]] of Citeaux. The abbey became too small for its members and it was necessary to send out bands to found new houses.<ref>{{cite web|title=Expositio in Apocalypsim|type=manuscript|id=MS Mm.5.31|url=http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-MM-00005-00031/229|website=Cambridge Digital Library|publisher=Cambridge Digital Library|accessdate=26 January 2016}}</ref> In 1118 [[Trois-Fontaines Abbey]] was founded in the [[diocese of Ch\u00e2lons]]; in 1119 [[Fontenay Abbey]] in the [[Diocese of Autun]]; and in 1121 [[Foigny Abbey]] near [[Vervins]], in the [[diocese of Laon]]. In addition to these victories, Bernard also had his trials. During an absence from Clairvaux, the Grand Prior of the [[Abbey of Cluny]] went to Clairvaux and enticed away Bernard's cousin, [[Robert of Ch\u00e2tillon]]. This was the occasion of the longest and most emotional of Bernard's letters.{{sfn|Gildas|1907}}\n\n[[File:Dehio 212 Cluny.jpg|thumb|left|The abbey of Cluny as it would have looked in Bernard's time]]\nIn the year 1119, Bernard was present at the first general chapter of the order convoked by Stephen of C\u00eeteaux. Though not yet 30 years old, Bernard was listened to with the greatest attention and respect, especially when he developed his thoughts upon the revival of the primitive spirit of regularity and fervour in all the monastic orders. It was this general chapter that gave definitive form to the constitutions of the order and the regulations of the ''Charter of Charity'', which [[Pope Callixtus II]] confirmed on 23 December 1119. In 1120, Bernard wrote his first work, ''{{lang|la|De Gradibus Superbiae et Humilitatis}}'', and his homilies which he entitled ''{{lang|la|De Laudibus Mariae}}''. The monks of the abbey of Cluny were unhappy to see C\u00eeteaux take the lead role among the religious orders of the Roman Catholic Church. For this reason, the [[Black Monks]] attempted to make it appear that the rules of the new order were impracticable. At the solicitation of William of St. Thierry, Bernard defended the order by publishing his ''Apology'' which was divided into two parts. In the first part, he proved himself innocent of the charges of Cluny and in the second he gave his reasons for his counterattacks. He protested his profound esteem for the Benedictines of Cluny whom he declared he loved equally as well as the other religious orders. [[Peter the Venerable]], [[abbot of Cluny]], answered Bernard and assured him of his great admiration and sincere friendship. In the meantime Cluny established a reform, and [[Abbot Suger]], the minister of [[Louis VI of France]], was converted by the ''Apology'' of Bernard. He hastened to terminate his worldly life and restore discipline in his monastery. The zeal of Bernard extended to the bishops, the clergy, and lay people. Bernard's letter to the [[archbishop of Sens]] was seen as a real treatise, ''\"De Officiis Episcoporum.\"'' About the same time he wrote his work on ''Grace and Free Will''.{{sfn|Gildas|1907}}\n\n==Doctor of the Church (1128\u201346)==\n[[File:Francisco Ribalta - Christ Embracing St Bernard - WGA19350.jpg|thumb|Christ Embracing St Bernard by [[Francisco Ribalta]]]]\nIn the year 1128 AD, Bernard participated in the [[Council of Troyes]], which had been convoked by [[Pope Honorius II]], and was presided over by Cardinal [[Matthew of Albano]]. The purpose of this council was to settle certain disputes of the [[Bishop of Paris|bishops of Paris]], and regulate other matters of the [[Church of France]]. The bishops made Bernard secretary of the council, and charged him with drawing up the synodal statutes. After the council, the [[bishop of Verdun]] was deposed. It was at this council that Bernard traced the outlines of the Rule of the [[Knights Templar]] who soon became the ideal of Christian nobility. Around this time, he praised them in his ''[[Liber ad milites templi de laude novae militiae]]''.<ref>Durant (1950) p.593.</ref>\n\nAgain reproaches arose against Bernard and he was denounced, even in [[Rome]]. He was accused of being a monk who meddled with matters that did not concern him. Cardinal Harmeric, on behalf of the pope, wrote Bernard a sharp letter of remonstrance stating, \"It is not fitting that noisy and troublesome frogs should come out of their marshes to trouble the Holy See and the cardinals.\"{{sfn|Gildas|1907}}\n\nBernard answered the letter by saying that, if he had assisted at the council, it was because he had been dragged to it by force, replying:\n\n{{quote|Now illustrious Harmeric if you so wished, who would have been more capable of freeing me from the necessity of assisting at the council than yourself? Forbid those noisy troublesome frogs to come out of their holes, to leave their marshes ... Then your friend will no longer be exposed to the accusations of pride and presumption.{{sfn|Gildas|1907}}}}\n\nThis letter made a positive impression on Harmeric, and in the [[Holy See|Vatican]].\n\n===Schism===\nBernard's influence was soon felt in provincial affairs. He defended the rights of the Church against the encroachments of kings and princes, and recalled to their duty [[Henri Sanglier]], archbishop of Sens and [[Stephen of Senlis]], bishop of Paris. On the death of Honorius II, which occurred on 14 February 1130, a [[Papal schism of 1130|schism]] broke out in the Church by the election of two popes, [[Pope Innocent II]] and Antipope Anacletus II. Innocent II, having been banished from Rome by Anacletus, took refuge in France. Louis VI convened a national council of the French bishops at [[\u00c9tampes]], and Bernard, summoned there by consent of the bishops, was chosen to judge between the rival popes. He decided in favour of [[Innocent II]]. After the council of \u00c9tampes, Bernard spoke with King [[Henry I of England]], also known as Henry Beauclerc, about Henry I's reservations regarding [[Pope Innocent II]]. Henry I was sceptical because most of the bishops of England supported [[Antipope Anacletus II]]; Bernard persuaded him to support Innocent. This caused the pope to be recognized by all the great powers. \n\nHe then went with him into Italy and reconciled [[Pisa]] with [[Genoa]], and [[Milan]] with the pope. The same year Bernard was again at the [[Council of Reims]] at the side of Innocent II. He then went to [[Aquitaine]] where he succeeded for the time in detaching [[William X, Duke of Aquitaine]], from the cause of Anacletus.{{sfn|Bunson|Bunson|Bunson|1998|p=129}}\n[[File:Marten Pepijn - Saint Bernard and the Duke of Aquitaine.jpg|thumb|left|''Saint Bernard and the Duke of Aquitaine'', by [[Marten Pepijn]]]]\n\n[[Germany]] had decided to support Innocent through [[Norbert of Xanten]], who was a friend of Bernard's. However, Innocent insisted on Bernard's company when he met with [[Lothair II, Holy Roman Emperor]]. Lothair II became Innocent's strongest ally among the nobility. Although the councils of \u00c9tampes, [[W\u00fcrzburg]], [[Council of Clermont|Clermont]], and [[Rheims]] all supported Innocent, large portions of the Christian world still supported Anacletus.\n\nBernard wrote to Gerard of Angouleme (a letter known as Letter 126), which questioned Gerard's reasons for supporting Anacletus. Bernard would later comment that Gerard was his most formidable opponent during the whole schism. After persuading Gerard, Bernard traveled to visit [[William X, Duke of Aquitaine]]. He was the hardest for Bernard to convince. He did not pledge allegiance to Innocent until 1135. After that, Bernard spent most of his time in [[Italy]] persuading the Italians to pledge allegiance to Innocent. He traveled to Sicily in 1137 to convince the king of Sicily to follow Innocent. The whole conflict ended when Anacletus died on 25 January 1138.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cristiani|first=L\u00e9on|translator-last=Bouchard|translator-first=M. Angeline|year=|orig-year=\u00a91977|title=St. Bernard of Clairvaux, 1090-1153|url=|location=Boston|publisher=St. Paul Editions|page=|oclc=2874038}}</ref>\n\nIn 1132, Bernard accompanied Innocent II into Italy, and at Cluny the pope abolished the dues which Clairvaux used to pay to that abbey. This action gave rise to a quarrel between the [[Cistercians|White Monks]] and the Black Monks which lasted 20 years. In May of that year, the pope, supported by the army of Lothair III, entered Rome, but Lothair III, feeling himself too weak to resist the partisans of Anacletus, retired beyond the Alps, and Innocent sought refuge in Pisa in September 1133. Bernard had returned to France in June and was continuing the work of peacemaking which he had commenced in 1130. Towards the end of 1134, he made a second journey into Aquitaine, where William X had relapsed into schism. Bernard invited William to the Mass which he celebrated in the Church of La Couldre. At the [[Eucharist]], he \"admonished the Duke not to despise God as he did His servants\".{{sfn|Gildas|1907}} William yielded and the schism ended. Bernard went again to Italy, where [[Roger II of Sicily]] was endeavouring to withdraw the Pisans from their allegiance to Innocent. He recalled the city of Milan to obedience to the pope as they had followed the deposed [[Anselm V, Archbishop of Milan]]. For this, he was offered, and he refused, the [[Archbishop of Milan|archbishopric of Milan]]. He then returned to Clairvaux. Believing himself at last secure in his cloister, Bernard devoted himself with renewed vigour to the composition of the works which would win for him the title of \"Doctor of the Church\". He wrote at this time his sermons on the ''[[Song of Songs]]''.{{efn|Other mystics such as [[John of the Cross]] also found their language and symbols in ''Song of Songs''.{{sfn|Cunningham|Egan|1996|p=128}}}} In 1137, he was again forced to leave his solitude by order of the pope to put an end to the quarrel between Lothair and Roger of Sicily. At the conference held at Palermo, Bernard succeeded in convincing Roger of the rights of Innocent II. He also silenced the final supporters who sustained the schism. Anacletus died of \"grief and disappointment\" in 1138, and with him the schism ended.{{sfn|Gildas|1907}}\n\nIn 1139, Bernard assisted at the [[Second Council of the Lateran]], in which the surviving adherents of the schism were definitively condemned. About the same time, Bernard was visited at Clairvaux by [[Saint Malachy]], [[Primate of All Ireland]], and a very close friendship formed between them. Malachy wanted to become a Cistercian, but the pope would not give his permission. Malachy would die at Clairvaux in 1148.{{sfn|Gildas|1907}}\n\n===Contest with Abelard===\nTowards the close of the 11th century, a spirit of independence flourished within schools of [[philosophy]] and [[theology]]. This led for a time to the exaltation of human reason and rationalism. The movement found an ardent and powerful advocate in [[Peter Abelard]]. Abelard's treatise on the [[Trinity]] had been condemned as heretical in 1121, and he was compelled to throw his own book into the fire. However, Abelard continued to develop his teachings, which were controversial in some quarters. Bernard, informed of this by [[William of St-Thierry]], is said to have held a meeting with Abelard intending to persuade him to amend his writings, during which Abelard repented and promised to do so. But once out of Bernard's presence, he reneged.{{sfn|Evans|2000|pp=115\u2013123}} Bernard then denounced Abelard to the pope and cardinals of the [[Roman Curia|Curia]]. Abelard sought a debate with Bernard, but Bernard initially declined, saying he did not feel matters of such importance should be settled by logical analyses. Bernard's letters to William of St-Thierry also express his apprehension about confronting the preeminent logician. Abelard continued to press for a public debate, and made his challenge widely known, making it hard for Bernard to decline. In 1141, at the urgings of Abelard, the archbishop of Sens called a council of bishops, where Abelard and Bernard were to put their respective cases so Abelard would have a chance to clear his name.{{sfn|Evans|2000|pp=115\u2013123}} Bernard lobbied the prelates on the evening before the debate, swaying many of them to his view. The next day, after Bernard made his opening statement, Abelard decided to retire without attempting to answer.{{sfn|Evans|2000|pp=115\u2013123}} The council found in favour of Bernard and their judgment was confirmed by the pope. Abelard submitted without resistance, and he retired to Cluny to live under the protection of Peter the Venerable, where he died two years later.{{sfn|Bunson|Bunson|Bunson|1998|p=129}}\n\n===Cistercian Order and heresy===\nBernard had occupied himself in sending bands of monks from his overcrowded monastery into Germany, Sweden, England, Ireland, Portugal, Switzerland, and Italy. Some of these, at the command of Innocent II, took possession of Tre Fontane Abbey, from which Eugene III would be chosen in 1145. Pope Innocent II died in the year 1143. His two successors, [[Pope Celestine II]] and [[Pope Lucius II]], reigned only a short time, and then Bernard saw one of his disciples, Bernard of Pisa, and known thereafter as Eugene III, raised to the [[Chair of Saint Peter]].{{sfn|Bunson|Bunson|Bunson|1998|p=130}} Bernard sent him, at the pope's own request, various instructions which comprise the ''Book of Considerations,'' the predominating idea of which is that the reformation of the Church ought to commence with the sanctity of the pope. Temporal matters are merely accessories; the principles according to Bernard's work were that piety and meditation were to precede action.{{sfn|McManners|1990|p=210}}\n\nHaving previously helped end the schism within the Church, Bernard was now called upon to combat heresy. [[Henry of Lausanne]], a former [[Cluny Abbey|Cluniac]] monk, had adopted the teachings of the Petrobrusians, followers of [[Peter of Bruys]] and spread them in a modified form after Peter's death.{{sfn|Alphand\u00e9ry|1911|pp=298\u2013299}} Henry of Lausanne's followers became known as Henricians. In June 1145, at the invitation of Cardinal [[Alberic of Ostia]], Bernard traveled in southern France.{{sfn|McManners|1990|p=211}} His preaching, aided by his ascetic looks and simple attire, helped doom the new sects. Both the Henrician and the Petrobrusian faiths began to die out by the end of that year. Soon afterwards, Henry of Lausanne was arrested, brought before the [[bishop of Toulouse]], and probably imprisoned for life. In a letter to the people of Toulouse, undoubtedly written at the end of 1146, Bernard calls upon them to extirpate the last remnants of the heresy. He also preached against [[Catharism]].{{sfn|Bunson|Bunson|Bunson|1998|p=130}}\n\n==Second Crusade (1146\u201349)==\nNews came at this time from the [[Holy Land]] that alarmed [[Christendom]]. Christians had been defeated at the [[Siege of Edessa]] and most of the county had fallen into the hands of the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk Turks]].{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p=48}} The [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] and the other [[Crusader states]] were threatened with similar disaster. Deputations of the bishops of [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia|Armenia]] solicited aid from the pope, and the King of France also sent ambassadors. In 1144 Eugene III commissioned Bernard to preach the Second Crusade{{sfn|Pirlo|1997}} and granted the same indulgences for it which [[Pope Urban II]] had accorded to the [[First Crusade]]<!--what were they? 1st Crusade article doesn't mention-->.<ref name=\"d594\">Durant (1950) p.594.</ref>\n\n[[File:Heiligenkreuz.Bernard of Clervaux.jpg|thumb|left|Bernard of Clairvaux, true effigy by Georg Andreas Wasshuber (1650\u20131732)]]\nThere was at first virtually no popular enthusiasm for the crusade as there had been in 1095. Bernard found it expedient to dwell upon taking the cross as a potent means of gaining absolution for sin and attaining grace. On 31 March, with King [[Louis VII of France]] present, he preached to an enormous crowd in a field at [[V\u00e9zelay]], making \"the speech of his life\"<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Popes-History-JOHN-JU-NORWICH/dp/0099565870|title=The Popes: A History|last=NORWICH|first=JOHN JU|date=2012|publisher=Vintage|isbn=9780099565871|location=London|language=English}}</ref>.

King and monk stood together, [[Gelasian doctrine|representing the combined will of earth and heaven]]. The enthusiasm of the assembly of Clermont in 1095, when [[Peter the Hermit]] and Urban II launched the first crusade, was matched by the holy fervor inspired by Bernard as he cried, \"O ye who listen to me! Hasten to appease the anger of heaven, but no longer implore its goodness by vain complaints. Clothe yourselves in sackcloth, but also cover yourselves with your impenetrable [[buckler]]s. The din of arms, the danger, the labors, the fatigues of war, are the penances that God now imposes upon you. Hasten then to expiate your sins by victories over the Infidels, and let the deliverance of the holy places be the reward of your repentance.\" As in the olden scene, the cry \"''{{lang|la|[[Deus vult]]! Deus vult}}!''{{thinsp}}\" rolled over the fields, and was echoed by the voice of the orator: \"Cursed be he who does not stain his sword with blood.\"{{sfn|Ludlow|1896|pp=164-167}}}}\n\nWhen Bernard was finished the crowd enlisted en masse; they supposedly ran out of cloth to make crosses. Bernard is said to have flung off his own robe and began tearing it into strips to make more<ref name=\"d594\" /><ref name=\":12\" />. Others followed his example and he and his helpers were supposedly still producing crosses as night fell.<ref name=\":12\" /> \n\nUnlike the First Crusade, the new venture attracted royalty, such as [[Eleanor of Aquitaine|Eleanor of Aquitaine, Queen of France]]; [[Thierry of Alsace]], [[Count of Flanders]]; [[Henry I of Champagne|Henry, the future Count of Champagne]]; Louis's brother [[Robert I of Dreux]]; [[Alphonse I of Toulouse]]; [[William II of Nevers]]; [[William de Warenne, 3rd Earl of Surrey]]; [[Hugh VII of Lusignan]], [[Yves II, Count of Soissons]]; and numerous other nobles and bishops. But an even greater show of support came from the common people. Bernard wrote to the pope a few days afterwards, \"Cities and castles are now empty. There is not left one man to seven women, and everywhere there are widows to still-living husbands.\"<ref name=\"d594\" />\n\nBernard then passed into Germany, and the reported miracles which multiplied almost at his every step undoubtedly contributed to the success of his mission. [[Conrad III of Germany]] and his nephew [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]], received the cross from the hand of Bernard.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p=48}} Pope Eugenius came in person to France to encourage the enterprise. As in the First Crusade, the preaching led to attacks on [[Jews]]; a fanatical French monk named [[Radulphe]] was apparently inspiring massacres of Jews in the Rhineland, [[Cologne]], [[Mainz]], [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], and [[Speyer]], with Radulphe claiming Jews were not contributing financially to the rescue of the Holy Land. The [[archbishop of Cologne]] and the [[archbishop of Mainz]] were vehemently opposed to these attacks and asked Bernard to denounce them. This he did, but when the campaign continued, Bernard traveled from Flanders to Germany to deal with the problems in person. He then found Radulphe in Mainz and was able to silence him, returning him to his monastery.<ref>Durant (1950) p. 391.</ref>\n\nThe last years of Bernard's life were saddened by the failure of the Second Crusade he had preached, the entire responsibility for which was thrown upon him.{{sfn|Bunson|Bunson|Bunson|1998|p=130}} Bernard considered it his duty to send an apology to the Pope and it is inserted in the second part of his ''\"Book of Considerations.\"'' There he explains how the sins of the crusaders were the cause of their misfortune and failures. \n\nMoved by his burning words, many Christians embarked for the Holy Land, but the crusade ended in miserable failure.{{sfn|Pirlo|1997}}\n\n==Final years (1149\u201353)==\n[[File:BernhardClairvaux Lactatio SourceUnknown.jpg|thumb|Bernard receiving milk from the breast of the Virgin Mary. The scene is a legend which allegedly took place at [[Speyer Cathedral]] in 1146.]]\nThe death of his contemporaries served as a warning to Bernard of his own approaching end. The first to die was Suger in 1152, of whom Bernard wrote to Eugene III, \"If there is any precious vase adorning the palace of the King of Kings it is the soul of the venerable Suger\". Conrad III and his son Henry died the same year. From the beginning of the year 1153, Bernard felt his death approaching. The passing of Pope Eugenius had struck the fatal blow by taking from him one whom he considered his greatest friend and consoler. Bernard died at age sixty-three on 20 August 1153, after forty years spent in the cloister.{{sfn|Bunson|Bunson|Bunson|1998|p=130}} He was buried at the Clairvaux Abbey, but after its dissolution in 1792 by the [[French Revolution|French revolutionary government]], his remains were transferred to [[Troyes Cathedral]].\n\n==Theology==\n{{Main article|Doctor Mellifluus}}\n\nBernard was named a Doctor of the Church in 1830. At the 800th anniversary of his death, [[Pope Pius XII]] issued an encyclical on Bernard, ''[[Doctor Mellifluus]]'', in which he labeled him \"The Last of the Fathers.\" Bernard did not reject human philosophy which is genuine philosophy, which leads to God; he differentiates between different kinds of knowledge, the highest being theological. The central elements of Bernard's Mariology are how he explained the [[virginity]] of Mary, ''the \"Star of the Sea\"'', and her role as [[Mediatrix]].\n\nThe first abbot of Clairvaux developed a rich theology of sacred space and [[Cistercian Hymnal|music]], writing extensively on both. \n\nBernard, like [[Thomas Aquinas]], denied the doctrine of the [[Immaculate Conception of Mary]]. {{sfn|James|1998|loc=ep. 174}}{{sfn|Most|1996}} [[John Calvin]] quotes Bernard several times<ref>{{cite book|last=Lane|first=Anthony N.

Another time, while sleeping in an inn, a prostitute was introduced naked beside him, and he saved his chastity by running.{{sfn|Pirlo|1997}}\n\nMany miracles were attributed to his intercession. One time he restored the power of speech to an old man that he might confess his sins before he died. Another time, an immense number of flies, that had infested the Church of Foigny, died instantly after the [[excommunication]] he made on them.{{sfn|Pirlo|1997}}\n\nSo great was his reputation that princes and [[Pope]]s sought his advice, and even the enemies of the Church admired the holiness of his life and the greatness of his writings.{{sfn|Pirlo|1997}}\n\n==Spirituality==\n[[File:Stained glass St Bernard MNMA Cl3273.jpg|thumb|left|Stained glass representing Bernard.

Although it has at times been suggested that the sermon form is a rhetorical device in a set of works which were only ever designed to be read, since such finely polished and lengthy literary pieces could not accurately have been recorded by a monk while Bernard was preaching, recent scholarship has tended toward the theory that, although what exists in these texts was certainly the product of Bernard's writing, they likely found their origins in sermons preached to the monks of Clairvaux.{{efn|For a history of the debate over the ''Sermons'', and an attempted solution, see {{harvc|last=Leclercq|first=Jean|chapter=Introduction|pp=vii\u2013xxx|in=Walsh|year=1976}}}} Bernard began to write these in 1135 but died without completing the series, with 86 sermons complete.

Gilbert wrote 47 sermons before he died in 1172, taking the series up to Chapter 5 of the Song of Songs. Another English Cistercian abbot, [[John of Ford]], wrote another 120 sermons on the Song of Songs, so completing the Cistercian sermon-commentary on the book.\n* There are 125 surviving ''{{lang|la|Sermones per annum}}'' (''Sermons on the Liturgical Year'').\n* There are also the ''{{lang|la|Sermones de diversis}}'' (''Sermons on Different Topics'').\n* 547 letters survive.{{sfn|SBOp|loc=v. 7\u20138}}\n \nMany letters, treatises, and other works, falsely attributed to him survive, and are now referred to as works by pseudo-Bernard.{{sfn|Gildas|1907}} These include:\n*{{cite book|author=pseudo-Bernard (pseud. of Guigo I)|author-link=Guigo I|year=c. 1150|title=L'\u00e9chelle du clo\u00eetre|trans-title=The scale of the cloister|type=letter|language=fr}}{{sfn|Gildas|1907}}\n*{{cite book|author=pseudo-Bernard|year=|title=Meditatio|trans-title=Meditations|language=la}} This was probably written at some point in the thirteenth century.

Bishkek is also the administrative centre of the [[Chuy Region]]. The province surrounds the city, although the city itself is not part of the province, but rather a province-level unit of Kyrgyzstan.\n\nIn 1825 [[Khokand]] authorities established the fortress of \"Pishpek\" in order to control local caravan-routes and to collect tribute from Kyrgyz tribes. On 4 September 1860, with the approval of the Kyrgyz, Russian forces led by Colonel Zimmermann destroyed the fortress. \nIn 1868 a Russian settlement was established on the site of the fortress under its original name, \"Pishpek\". It lay within the General Governorship of [[Russian Turkestan]] and its [[Semirechye Oblast]].\n\nIn 1925 the [[Kara-Kirghiz Autonomous Oblast]] was established in Russian Turkestan, promoting Pishpek to its capital. In 1926 the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] renamed the city as ''Frunze'', after the [[Bolshevik]] military leader [[Mikhail Frunze]] (1885\u20131925), who was born there. In 1936, the city of Frunze became the capital of the [[Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic]], during the final stages of the [[national delimitation in the Soviet Union]].\n\nIn 1991 the Kyrgyz parliament changed the capital's name to \"Bishkek\".\n\nBishkek is situated at an altitude of about {{convert|800|meters}}, just off the northern fringe of the [[Kyrgyz Ala-Too]] range, an extension of the [[Tian Shan]] mountain range. These mountains rise to a height of {{convert|4855|meters}} and provide a  backdrop to the city. North of the city, a fertile and gently undulating steppe extends far north into neighboring [[Kazakhstan]]. The [[Chui River]] drains most of the area. Bishkek is connected to the [[Turkestan-Siberia Railway]] by a [[spur line]].\n\nBishkek is a city of wide boulevards and marble-faced public buildings combined with numerous [[Khrushchyovka|Soviet-style]] apartment blocks surrounding interior courtyards. There are also thousands of smaller privately built houses, mostly outside the city centre. Streets follow a grid pattern, with most flanked on both sides by narrow irrigation channels, watering innumerable trees to provide shade in the hot summers.\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Timeline of Bishkek}}\n\n===Kokhand rule===\n\nOriginally a caravan rest stop (possibly founded by the [[Sogdians]]) on one of the branches of the [[Silk Road]] through the [[Tian Shan]] range, the location was fortified in 1825 by the [[Uzbekistan|Uzbek]] khan of [[Kokhand]] with a mud fort. In the last years of Kokhand rule, the Pishpek fortress was led by Atabek, the Datka.\n\n===Tsarist era===\n\nIn 1860, the fort was conquered and razed by the military forces of Colonel Zimmermann when [[Imperial Russia|Tsarist Russia]] annexed the area. Colonel [[Zimmermann]] rebuilt the town over the destroyed fort and put field Poruchik Titov as head of a new Russian garrison. The site was redeveloped from 1877 onward by the Russian government, which encouraged the settlement of Russian peasants by giving them fertile land to develop.\n\n===Soviet era===\n[[File:Michael Frunze Statue vor dem Bahnhof von Bischkek.JPG|thumb|upright|left|Frunze statue near the railway station]]\nIn 1926, the city became the capital of the newly established [[Kara-Kirghiz Autonomous Oblast|Kirghiz ASSR]] and was renamed \"Frunze\" after [[Mikhail Frunze]], [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin's]] close associate who was born in Bishkek and played key roles during the [[Russian Revolution of 1905|revolutions of 1905]] and [[Russian Revolution of 1917|1917]] and during the [[Russian civil war]] of the early 1920s.\n\n===Independence era===\n\nThe early 1990s were tumultuous. In June 1990, a state of emergency was declared following severe ethnic riots in southern Kyrgyzstan that threatened to spread to the capital. The city was renamed Bishkek on 5 February 1991 and Kyrgyzstan achieved independence later that year during the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985\u20131991)|breakup of the Soviet Union]]. Before independence, the majority of Bishkek's population were ethnic [[Russian people|Russians]]. In 2004, Russians made up approximately 20% of the city's population, and about {{nowrap|7\u20138%}} in 2011.<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3681/is_200407/ai_n9472919 Residential Real Estate Market in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan: Current Conditions and Prospects]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090321113715/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3681/is_200407/ai_n9472919 |date=21 March 2009 }}</ref>\n\nToday, Bishkek is a modern city with many restaurants and cafes, and with many second-hand European and Japanese cars and minibuses crowding its streets. However, streets and sidewalks have fallen into disrepair since the 1990s. At the same time, Bishkek still preserves its former Soviet feel with Soviet-period buildings and gardens prevailing over newer structures.\n\nBishkek is also the country's financial center, with all of the country's 21 commercial banks headquartered there. During the Soviet era, the city was home to a large number of industrial plants, but most have been shut down since 1991 or now operate on a much reduced scale. One of Bishkek's largest employment centers today is the [[Dordoy Bazaar|Dordoy Bazaar open market]], where many of the Chinese goods imported to [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] countries are sold.\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Orientation===\nThough the city is relatively young, the surrounding area has some sites of interest dating to prehistorical times.  There are also sites from the [[Greco-Buddhist]] period, the period of [[Nestorian Church|Nestorian]] influence, the era of the Central Asian ''[[khanate]]s'', and the Soviet period.\n[[File:Russian Orthodox cathedral in Bishkek.jpg|thumb|Russian Orthodox cathedral of the Holy Resurrection.]]\n[[File:Bishkek historical museum.jpg|thumb|right|National Historical Museum]]\n\nThe central part of the city is laid out on a rectangular grid plan. The city's main street is the east\u2013west Chui Avenue ([[Chuy Prospekti]]), named after the region's [[Chui River|main river]]. In the Soviet era, it was called [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] Avenue. Along or near it are many of the most important government buildings and  universities.  These include the [[Kyrgyz Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences]] compound. The westernmost section of the avenue is known as [[Deng Xiaoping]] Avenue.\n\nThe main north\u2013south street is [[Yusup Abdrakhmanov]] Street, still commonly referred to by its old name, Sovietskaya Street. Its northern and southern sections are called, respectively, Yelebesov and Baityk Batyr Streets. Several major shopping centers are located along it, and in the north it provides access to [[Dordoy Bazaar]].\n\nErkindik (\"Freedom\") Boulevard runs from north to south, from the main railroad station (Bishkek II) south of Chui Avenue to the museum quarter and sculpture park just north of Chui Avenue, and further north toward the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In the past it was called Dzerzhinsky Boulevard,  named after a Communist revolutionary, [[Felix Edmundovich Dzerzhinsky|Felix Dzerzhinsky]], and its northern continuation is still called Dzerzhinsky Street.\n\nAn important east\u2013west street is Jibek Jolu ('[[Silk Road]]'). It runs parallel to Chui Avenue about {{convert|1|mi|km|order=flip|0|abbr=on}} north of it, and is part of the main east\u2013west road of [[Chui Province]]. Both the eastern and western bus terminals are located along Jibek Jolu.\n\nThere is a Roman Catholic church located at ul. Vasiljeva 197 (near Rynok Bayat). It is the only Catholic cathedral in Kyrgyzstan.<ref>[http://www.catholic-kyrgyzstan.org/ Catholic Church in Kyrgyzstan]. Catholic-kyrgyzstan.org.

The mountains to the south provide a natural boundary and protection from much of the damaging weather, as does the smaller mountain chain which runs north-west to south-east. In the winter months, sparse [[Winter storm|snow storms]] and frequent heavy [[fog]] are the dominating features. There are sometimes temperature inversions, during which the fog can last for days at a time.\n{{clear}}\n{{Weather box\n|width = auto\n|location = Bishkek\n|metric first = y\n|single line = y\n|Jan record high C = 19.2\n|Feb record high C = 25.3\n|Mar record high C = 30.5\n|Apr record high C = 34.7\n|May record high C = 35.6\n|Jun record high C = 40.9\n|Jul record high C = 42.8\n|Aug record high C = 39.7\n|Sep record high C = 36.8\n|Oct record high C = 34.1\n|Nov record high C = 27.9\n|Dec record high C = 23.3\n|year record high C = 42.8\n|Jan high C = 3.2\n|Feb high C = 4.9\n|Mar high C = 11.2\n|Apr high C = 18.5\n|May high C = 23.6\n|Jun high C = 29.0\n|Jul high C = 31.7\n|Aug high C = 30.9\n|Sep high C = 25.5\n|Oct high C = 17.8\n|Nov high C = 11.0\n|Dec high C = 5.0\n|year high C = 17.7\n| Jan mean C = \u22122.6\n| Feb mean C = \u22120.8\n| Mar mean C = 5.3\n| Apr mean C = 12.3\n| May mean C = 17.4\n| Jun mean C = 22.4\n| Jul mean C = 24.9\n| Aug mean C = 23.8\n| Sep mean C = 18.5\n| Oct mean C = 11.0\n| Nov mean C = 4.7\n| Dec mean C = \u22120.9\n|year mean C = 11.3\n|Jan low C = \u22127.1\n|Feb low C = \u22125.2\n|Mar low C = 0.4\n|Apr low C = 6.4\n|May low C = 11.1\n|Jun low C = 15.6\n|Jul low C = 17.9\n|Aug low C = 16.4\n|Sep low C = 11.3\n|Oct low C = 5.0\n|Nov low C = \u22120.1\n|Dec low C = \u22125.1\n|year low C = 5.6\n|Jan record low C = \u221231.9\n|Feb record low C = \u221234.0\n|Mar record low C = \u221221.8\n|Apr record low C = \u221212.3\n|May record low C = \u22125.5\n|Jun record low C = 2.4\n|Jul record low C = 7.4\n|Aug record low C = 5.1\n|Sep record low C = \u22122.8\n|Oct record low C = \u221211.2\n|Nov record low C = \u221232.2\n|Dec record low C = \u221229.1\n|year record low C = \u221234.0\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 26\n|Feb precipitation mm = 35\n|Mar precipitation mm = 55\n|Apr precipitation mm = 67\n|May precipitation mm = 61\n|Jun precipitation mm = 34\n|Jul precipitation mm = 21\n|Aug precipitation mm = 13\n|Sep precipitation mm = 19\n|Oct precipitation mm = 45\n|Nov precipitation mm = 42\n|Dec precipitation mm = 35\n|year precipitation mm = 453\n|Jan humidity = 75\n|Feb humidity = 75\n|Mar humidity = 71\n|Apr humidity = 63\n|May humidity = 60\n|Jun humidity = 50\n|Jul humidity = 46\n|Aug humidity = 45\n|Sep humidity = 48\n|Oct humidity = 62\n|Nov humidity = 70\n|Dec humidity = 75\n|year humidity = 62\n|Jan rain days = 3\n|Feb rain days = 5\n|Mar rain days = 9\n|Apr rain days = 12\n|May rain days = 13\n|Jun rain days = 10\n|Jul rain days = 10\n|Aug rain days = 6\n|Sep rain days = 6\n|Oct rain days = 8\n|Nov rain days = 7\n|Dec rain days = 4\n|year rain days = 93\n|Jan snow days = 9\n|Feb snow days = 9\n|Mar snow days = 5\n|Apr snow days = 2\n|May snow days = 0.3\n|Jun snow days = 0\n|Jul snow days = 0\n|Aug snow days = 0\n|Sep snow days = 0\n|Oct snow days = 1\n|Nov snow days = 4\n|Dec snow days = 7\n|year snow days = 37\n|Jan sun = 137\n|Feb sun = 128\n|Mar sun = 153\n|Apr sun = 194\n|May sun = 261\n|Jun sun = 306\n|Jul sun = 332\n|Aug sun = 317\n|Sep sun = 264\n|Oct sun = 196\n|Nov sun = 144\n|Dec sun = 114\n|year sun = 2546\n|source 1 = Pogoda.ru.net<ref name = Pogoda >\n{{cite web\n| url = http://www.pogodaiklimat.ru/climate/38353.htm\n| title = Weather and Climate-The Climate of Bishkek\n| publisher = Weather and Climate\n| language = Russian\n| accessdate = 8 February 2015\n}}</ref> \n|source 2 = NOAA (sun, 1961\u20131990)<ref name = NOAA >\n{{cite web\n| url = ftp://ftp.atdd.noaa.gov/pub/GCOS/WMO-Normals/TABLES/REG_II/KY/38353.TXT\n| title = Frunze (Bishkek) Climate Normals 1961\u20131990\n| publisher = [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]\n| accessdate = 8 February 2015}}</ref>\n|date=August 2010\n}}\n\n==Demographics==\nBishkek is the most populated city in Kyrgyzstan.

The som's value fluctuates regularly, but averaged around 61 som per U.S. dollar as of February 2015. The economy in Bishkek is primarily agricultural, and agricultural products are sometimes bartered in the outlying regions. The streets of Bishkek are regularly lined with produce vendors in a market style venue. In most of the downtown area there is a more urban cityscape with banks, stores, markets and malls. Sought after goods include hand-crafted artisan pieces, such as statues, carvings, paintings and many nature-based sculptures.\n\n=== Housing ===\nAs with many cities in Post-Soviet states, housing in Bishkek has undergone extensive changes since the collapse of the Soviet Union. While housing was formerly distributed to citizens in the Soviet-era, housing in Bishkek has since become privatized.\n\nThough single family houses are slowly becoming more popular, the majority of the residents live in Soviet-era apartments. Despite the Kyrgyz economy experiencing growth, increases in available housing has been slow with very little new construction. As a result of this growing prosperity and the lack of new formal housing, prices have been rising significantly \u2013 doubling from 2001 to 2002.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Roseman|first=Gary|title=The Residential Real Estate Market in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan|journal=Real Estate Issues|volume=Summer 2004}}</ref>\n\nThose unable to afford the high price of housing within Bishkek, notably internal migrants from rural villages and small provincial towns often have to resort to informal squatter settlements on the outskirts of the city. These settlements are estimated to house 400,000 people or about 30 percent of Bishkek\u2019s population. While many of the settlements have lacked basic necessities such as electricity and running water, recently there has been a push by the local government to provide these services.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Isabaeva|first=Eliza|title=Migration into the \"Illegality\" and Coping with Difficulties in a Squatter Settlement in Bishkek|journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Ethnologie|volume=138 |year=2013}}</ref>\n\n==Government==\nLocal government is administered by the Bishkek Mayor's Office.  [[Askarbek Salymbekov]] was mayor until his resignation in August 2005, after which his deputy, [[Arstanbek Nogoev]], took over the mayorship. Nogoev was in turn removed from his position in October 2007 through a decree of President [[Kurmanbek Bakiyev]] and replaced by businessman and former first deputy prime minister [[Daniar Usenov]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesca.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=182916&Itemid=7|publisher=The Times of Central Asia|title=New mayor of Bishkek promises to solve capital\u2019s problems|date=17 October 2007|accessdate=18 October 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080619111339/http://www.timesca.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=182916&Itemid=7 |archivedate=19 June 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://jamestown.org/edm/article.php?article_id=2372503|journal=Eurasia Daily Monitor|publisher=The Jamestown Foundation|volume=4|issue=190|last=Marat|first=Erica|title=Upcoming referendum sinks Kyrgyzstan deeper into crisis|date=15 October 2007|accessdate=18 October 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071022122621/http://jamestown.org/edm/article.php?article_id=2372503 |archivedate = 22 October 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Kyrgyz capital gets new mayor |url=http://www.hri.org/news/balkans/rferl/2005/05-08-22.rferl.html#20 |publisher=Radio Free Europe |date=22 August 2005 |accessdate=18 October 2007 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uKgVssqi?url=http://www.hri.org/news/balkans/rferl/2005/05-08-22.rferl.html#20 |archivedate=18 November 2010 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}</ref> In July 2008 former head of the Kyrgyz Railways [[Nariman Tuleyev]] was appointed mayor, who was dismissed by the interim government after 7 April 2010.

These services are remarkably slow (over 48 hours to Yekaterinburg), due to long stops at the border and the indirect route (the trains first have to go west for more than a {{convert|100|km}} before they enter the main [[Turksib]] line and can continue to the east or north).

Russia subsequently (2003) established an air base of its own ([[Kant (air base)|Kant Air Base]]) near [[Kant, Kyrgyzstan|Kant]], some {{convert|20|km}} east of Bishkek.

Young William Wallace witnesses Longshanks' treachery, survives the deaths of his father and brother, and is taken abroad on a pilgrimage throughout Europe by his paternal Uncle Argyle, where he is educated. Years later, Longshanks grants his noblemen land and privileges in Scotland, including [[Droit du seigneur|''Prima Nocte'']]. Meanwhile, a grown Wallace returns to Scotland and falls in love with his childhood friend Murron MacClannough, and the two marry in secret. Wallace rescues Murron from being raped by English soldiers, but as she fights off their second attempt, Murron is captured and publicly executed. In retribution, Wallace leads his clan to [[Action at Lanark|slaughter the English garrison]] in his hometown and send the occupying garrison at Lanark back to England.\n\nLongshanks orders his son [[Edward II of England|Prince Edward]] to stop Wallace by any means necessary. Wallace rebels against the English, and as his legend spreads, hundreds of Scots from the surrounding clans join him. Wallace leads his army to victory at the [[Battle of Stirling Bridge]] and then destroys the city of [[York, England|York]], killing Longshanks' nephew and sending his severed head to the king. Wallace seeks the assistance of [[Robert the Bruce]], the son of nobleman [[Robert de Brus, 6th Lord of Annandale|Robert the Elder]] and a contender for the Scottish crown. Robert is dominated by his father, who wishes to secure the throne for his son by submitting to the English. Worried by the threat of the rebellion, Longshanks sends his son's wife [[Isabella of France]] to try to negotiate with Wallace as a distraction for the landing of another invasion force in Scotland.\n\nAfter meeting him in person, Isabella becomes enamored of Wallace. Warned of the coming invasion by Isabella, Wallace implores the Scottish nobility to take immediate action to counter the threat and take back the country. Leading the English army himself, Longshanks confronts the Scots at Falkirk where noblemen Lochlan and Mornay, having been bribed by Longshanks, betray Wallace, causing the Scots to lose the [[Battle of Falkirk|battle]]. As Wallace charges toward the departing Longshanks on horseback, he is intercepted by one of the king's lancers, who turns out to be Robert the Bruce, but filled with remorse, Bruce gets Wallace to safety before the English can capture him. Wallace kills Lochlan and Mornay for their betrayal, and wages a guerrilla war against the English for the next seven years, assisted by Isabella, with whom he eventually has an affair. Robert sets up a meeting with Wallace in Edinburgh, but Robert's father has conspired with other nobles to capture and hand over Wallace to the English. Learning of his treachery, Robert disowns his father. Isabella exacts revenge on the now terminally ill Longshanks by telling him that his bloodline will be destroyed upon his death as she is now pregnant with Wallace's child.\n\nIn London, Wallace is brought before an English magistrate, tried for high treason, and condemned to public torture and beheading. Even whilst being [[hanged, drawn and quartered]], Wallace refuses to submit to the king. As cries for mercy come from the watching crowd deeply moved by the Scotsman's valor, the magistrate offers him one final chance, asking him only to utter the word, \"Mercy\", and be granted a quick death. Wallace instead shouts, \"Freedom!\", and the judge orders his death. Moments before being decapitated, Wallace sees a vision of Murron in the crowd, smiling at him.\n\nIn 1314, Robert, now Scotland's king, leads a Scottish army before a ceremonial line of English troops on the fields of [[Battle of Bannockburn|Bannockburn]], where he is to formally accept English rule. As he begins to ride toward the English, he stops and invokes Wallace's memory, imploring his men to fight with him as they did with Wallace. Robert then leads his army into battle against the stunned English, winning the Scots their freedom.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Mel Gibson]] as [[William Wallace]]\n** James Robinson as young William Wallace\n* [[Sophie Marceau]] as Princess [[Isabella of France]]\n* [[Angus Macfadyen]] as [[Robert the Bruce]]\n* [[Patrick McGoohan]] as King [[Edward I of England|Edward \"Longshanks\"]]\n* [[Catherine McCormack]] as Murron MacClannough-Wallace\n** Mhairi Calvey as young Murron\n* [[Brendan Gleeson]] as Hamish\n** Andrew Weir as young Hamish\n* [[Peter Hanly]] as [[Edward II of England|Prince Edward]]\n* [[James Cosmo]] as Campbell\n* [[David O'Hara]] as Stephen of Ireland\n* [[Ian Bannen]] as [[Robert de Brus, 6th Lord of Annandale|Bruce's father]]\n* [[Se\u00e1n McGinley]] as MacClannough\n* [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]] as Argyle Wallace\n* [[Sean Lawlor]] as Malcolm Wallace\n* Sandy Nelson as John Wallace\n* [[Stephen Billington]] as Phillip\n* [[John Kavanagh (actor)|John Kavanagh]] as Craig\n* [[Alun Armstrong]] as Mornay\n* John Murtagh as Lochlan\n* [[Tommy Flanagan (actor)|Tommy Flanagan]] as Morrison\n* [[Donal Gibson]] as Stewart\n* Jeanne Marine as Nicolette\n* [[Michael Byrne (actor)|Michael Byrne]] as Smythe\n* [[Malcolm Tierney]] as [[William Heselrig|Magistrate]]\n* [[Bernard Horsfall]] as Balliol\n* [[Peter Mullan]] as Veteran\n* [[Gerard McSorley]] as Cheltham (inspired by [[Hugh de Cressingham]])\n* [[Richard Leaf]] as Governor of York\n* [[Mark Lees]] as Old Crippled Scotsman\n* [[Tam White]] as MacGregor\n* [[Jimmy Chisholm]] as Faudron\n* [[David Gant]] as the Royal Magistrate\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\nProducer [[Alan Ladd Jr.]] initially had the project at [[MGM-Path\u00e9 Communications]] when he picked up the script from Wallace.<ref>{{Citation|last=gaspare88|title=Making Of Braveheart Behind The Scenes Documentary|date=2018-02-07|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X20ii_zg_N4|access-date=2018-10-26}}</ref> When [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] was going through new management in 1993, Ladd left the studio and took some of its top properties, including ''Braveheart''.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_HtZAAAAMAAJ&q=Ladd+takes+Braveheart&dq=Ladd+takes+Braveheart|title=Robin Hood: A Cinematic History of the English Outlaw and His Scottish Counterparts|last=Nollen|first=Scott Allen|date=1999-01-01|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9780786406432|language=en}}</ref> Gibson picked up the script and although he liked it, he passed on it.

Edward enjoyed poetry and harp music, was a devoted and loving husband to his wife [[Eleanor of Castile]], and as a religious man he gave generously to charity.

Aldiss was named a Grand Master by the [[Science Fiction Writers of America]] in 2000 and inducted by the Science Fiction Hall of Fame in 2004.

As a result, Faber and Faber published Aldiss' first book, ''The Brightfount Diaries'' (1955), a 200-page novel in diary form about the life of a sales assistant in a bookshop.\n\nAbout this time he also began to write science fiction for various magazines. According to [[ISFDB]], his first [[speculative fiction]] in print was the [[short story]] ''Criminal Record'', published by [[John Carnell]] in the July 1954 issue of ''[[Science Fantasy (magazine)|Science Fantasy]]''.<ref name=isfdb/> Several of his stories appeared in 1955, including three in monthly issues of ''[[New Worlds (magazine)|New Worlds]]'',<ref name=\"isfdb\"/> a more important magazine also edited by Carnell.<!-- supported by our magazine articles -->\n\nIn 1954, ''[[The Observer]]'' newspaper ran a competition for a short story set in the year 2500.

Aldiss confessed to being a science fiction author, to the delight of the publishers, who had a number of [[science fiction fandom|science fiction fans]] in high places, and so his first science fiction book was published,{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} a collection of short stories entitled ''Space, Time and Nathaniel'' (Faber, 1957). By this time, his earnings from writing matched his wages in the bookshop, and he made the decision to become a full-time writer.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n[[File:Brian Aldiss (3).jpg|left|thumb|upright|In 2012]]\nAldiss led the voting for Most Promising New Author of 1958 at the next year's [[Worldcon]], but finished behind \"no award\".<ref name=SFAwards/> He was elected president of the [[British Science Fiction Association]] in 1960.

For Faber he edited ''Introducing SF'', a collection of stories typifying various themes of science fiction, and ''Best Fantasy Stories''. In 1961, he edited an anthology of reprinted short science fiction for the British paperback publisher [[Penguin Books]] under the title ''Penguin Science Fiction''. This was remarkably successful, went into numerous reprints, and was followed up by two further anthologies: ''More Penguin Science Fiction'' (1963) and ''Yet More Penguin Science Fiction'' (1964). The later anthologies enjoyed the same success as the first, and all three were eventually published together as ''The Penguin Science Fiction Omnibus'' (1973), which also went into a number of reprints. In the 1970s, he produced several large collections of classic grand-scale science fiction, under the titles ''Space Opera'' (1974), ''Space Odysseys'' (1975), ''Galactic Empires'' (1976), ''Evil Earths'' (1976), and ''Perilous Planets'' (1978) which were quite successful.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} Around this time, he edited a large-format volume ''Science Fiction Art'' (1975), with selections of artwork from the magazines and [[pulp magazines|pulps]].\n\nIn response to the results from the [[space probe|planetary probes]] of the 1960s and 1970s, which showed that [[Venus]] was completely unlike the hot, tropical jungle usually depicted in science fiction, Aldiss and Harrison edited an anthology ''[[Farewell, Fantastic Venus]]!'', reprinting stories based on the pre-probe ideas of Venus.

The battle unfolded in extensive manoeuvring and three main engagements (the battlecruiser action, the fleet action and the night action), from 31 May to 1 June 1916, off the [[North Sea]] coast of Denmark's [[Jutland]] Peninsula.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/world-war-one/naval-warfare-and-world-war-one/the-battle-of-jutland/ |title= The Battle of Jutland |publisher= History Learning Site |date= |accessdate= 26 July 2016}}</ref> It was the largest naval battle and the only full-scale clash of [[battleship]]s in that war.  Jutland was the third [[fleet action]] between steel battleships, following the smaller but more decisive battles of the [[Battle of the Yellow Sea|Yellow Sea (1904)]] and [[Battle of Tsushima|Tsushima (1905)]] during the [[Russo-Japanese War]].  Jutland was the last major battle in world history fought primarily by battleships.<ref>Jeremy Black, \"Jutland's Place in History,\" ''Naval History'' (June 2016) 30#3 pp 16\u201321.</ref>\n\nGermany's High Seas Fleet intended to lure out, trap, and destroy a portion of the Grand Fleet, as the German naval force was insufficient to openly engage the entire British fleet. This formed part of a larger strategy to break the British [[blockade of Germany]] and to allow German naval vessels access to the Atlantic. Meanwhile, Great Britain's Royal Navy pursued a strategy of engaging and destroying the High Seas Fleet, thereby keeping German naval forces contained and away from Britain and her [[Sea lines of communication|shipping lanes]].<ref>{{cite news|title= ''Distant Victory: The Battle of Jutland and the Allied Triumph in the First World War'', page XCIV |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=VlTmHeEYgxsC&pg=PA94&lpg=PA94&dq=battle+of+jutland+germany+wanted+access+to+the+atlantic&source=bl&ots=6Z2ftnrc0N&sig=2oRrq40o4U9c8slBn4KgzFwBftU&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi-7JWuz4LNAhUmCcAKHYDqAasQ6AEISjAI#v=onepage&q=battle%20of%20jutland%20germany%20wanted%20access%20to%20the%20atlantic&f=false|date= July 2006|publisher= Praeger Security International|accessdate= 30 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe Germans planned to use Vice-Admiral [[Franz von Hipper|Franz Hipper]]'s fast scouting group of five modern [[battlecruiser]]s to lure Vice-Admiral [[David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty|Sir David Beatty's]] battlecruiser squadrons into the path of the main German fleet. They stationed submarines in advance across the likely routes of the British ships. However, the British learned from signal intercepts that a major fleet operation was likely, so on 30 May Jellicoe sailed with the Grand Fleet to rendezvous with Beatty, passing over the locations of the German submarine [[Picket (military)|picket lines]] while they were unprepared. The German plan had been delayed, causing further problems for their submarines, which had reached the limit of their endurance at sea.\n\nOn the afternoon of 31 May, Beatty encountered Hipper's battlecruiser force long before the Germans had expected. In a running battle, Hipper successfully drew the British [[vanguard]] into the path of the High Seas Fleet. By the time Beatty sighted the larger force and turned back towards the British main fleet, he had lost two battlecruisers from a force of six battlecruisers and four powerful battleships \u2013 though he had sped ahead of his battleships of [[5th Battle Squadron (United Kingdom)#Battle of Jutland|5th Battle Squadron]] earlier in the day, effectively losing them as an integral component for much of this opening action against the five ships commanded by Hipper. Beatty's withdrawal at the sight of the High Seas Fleet, which the British had not known were in the open sea, would reverse the course of the battle by drawing the German fleet in pursuit towards the British Grand Fleet. Between 18:30, when the sun was lowering on the western horizon, back-lighting the German forces, and nightfall at about 20:30, the two fleets \u2013 totalling 250 ships between them \u2013 directly engaged twice.\n\nFourteen British and eleven German ships sank, with a total of 9,823 deaths. After sunset, and throughout the night, Jellicoe manoeuvred to cut the Germans off from their base, hoping to continue the battle the next morning, but under the cover of darkness Scheer broke through the British light forces forming the rearguard of the Grand Fleet and returned to port.<ref>Campbell, ''Analysis'' pp. 274</ref>\n\nBoth sides claimed victory. The British lost more ships and twice as many sailors but succeeded in containing the German fleet. The British press criticised the Grand Fleet's failure to force a decisive outcome, while Scheer's plan of destroying a substantial portion of the British fleet also failed. The British strategy of denying Germany access to both the United Kingdom and the Atlantic did succeed, which was the British long-term goal.<ref>{{cite news|title= ''Distant Victory: The Battle of Jutland and the Allied Triumph in the First World War'', page XCV |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=VlTmHeEYgxsC&pg=PA94&lpg=PA94&dq=battle+of+jutland+germany+wanted+access+to+the+atlantic&source=bl&ots=6Z2ftnrc0N&sig=2oRrq40o4U9c8slBn4KgzFwBftU&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi-7JWuz4LNAhUmCcAKHYDqAasQ6AEISjAI#v=onepage&q=battle%20of%20jutland%20germany%20wanted%20access%20to%20the%20atlantic&f=false|date= July 2006|publisher= Praeger Security International|accessdate= 30 May 2016}}</ref> The Germans' \"[[fleet in being]]\" continued to pose a threat, requiring the British to keep their battleships concentrated in the North Sea, but the battle reinforced the German policy of avoiding all fleet-to-fleet contact. At the end of 1916, after further unsuccessful attempts to reduce the Royal Navy's numerical advantage, the German Navy accepted that its surface ships had been successfully contained, subsequently turning its efforts and resources to [[unrestricted submarine warfare]] and the destruction of Allied and neutral shipping, which \u2013 along with the [[Zimmermann Telegram]] \u2013 by April 1917 triggered the [[United States|United States of America]]'s declaration of war on Germany.<ref>Protasio, John.

Debate over their performance and the significance of the battle continues to this day.\n{{TOC limit|limit=2}}\n\n==Background and planning==\n\n===German planning===\nWith 16 [[dreadnought]]-type battleships, compared with the Royal Navy's 28, the German [[High Seas Fleet]] stood little chance of winning a head-to-head clash. The Germans therefore adopted a [[Defeat in detail|divide-and-conquer strategy]]. They would stage raids into the North Sea and bombard the English coast, with the aim of luring out small British squadrons and pickets, which could then be destroyed by superior forces or submarines.\n\nIn January 1916, Admiral [[Hugo von Pohl|von Pohl]], commander of the German fleet, fell ill. He was replaced by Scheer, who believed that the fleet had been used too defensively, had better ships and men than the British, and ought to take the war to them.<ref>Tarrant p.49</ref> According to Scheer, the German [[naval strategy]] should be:\n\n{{quote |to damage the English fleet by offensive raids against the naval forces engaged in watching and blockading the [[Heligoland Bight|German Bight]], as well as by [[naval mine|mine]]-laying on the British coast and [[submarine]] attack, whenever possible. After an equality of strength had been realised as a result of these operations, and all our forces had been made ready and concentrated, an attempt was to be made with our fleet to seek battle under circumstances unfavourable to the enemy.}}\n\n[[File:Almirante Reinhard Scheer.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Reinhard Scheer]], German fleet commander]]\n\nOn 25 April 1916, a decision was made by the German admiralty to halt indiscriminate attacks by submarine on merchant shipping. This followed protests from neutral countries, notably the United States, that their nationals had been the victims of attacks. Germany agreed that future attacks would only take place in accord with internationally agreed prize rules, which required an attacker to give a warning and allow the crews of vessels time to escape, and not to attack neutral vessels at all. Scheer believed that it would not be possible to continue attacks on these terms, which took away the advantage of secret approach by submarines and left them vulnerable to even relatively small guns on the target ships. Instead, he set about deploying the submarine fleet against military vessels.<ref>Tarrant p. 55</ref>\n\nIt was hoped that, following a successful German submarine attack, fast British escorts, such as [[destroyer]]s, would be tied down by anti-submarine operations. If the Germans could catch the British in the expected locations, good prospects were thought to exist of at least partially redressing the balance of forces between the fleets. \"After the British sortied in response to the raiding attack force\", the Royal Navy's centuries-old instincts for aggressive action could be exploited to draw its weakened units towards the main German fleet under Scheer. The hope was that Scheer would thus be able to ambush a section of the British fleet and destroy it.<ref>Campbell, p. 2</ref>\n\n====Submarine deployments====\nA plan was devised to station submarines offshore from British naval bases, and then stage some action that would draw out the British ships to the waiting submarines. The battlecruiser {{SMS|Seydlitz}} had been damaged in a previous engagement, but was due to be repaired by mid May, so an operation was scheduled for 17 May 1916. At the start of May, difficulties with condensers were discovered on ships of the third battleship squadron, so the operation was put back to 23 May. Ten submarines\u2014{{SMU|U-24||2}}, {{SMU|U-32|Germany|2}}, {{SMU|U-43|Germany|2}}, {{SMU|U-44||2}}, {{SMU|UC-47||2}}, {{SMU|U-51||2}}, {{SMU|U-52||2}}, {{SMU|U-63|Germany|2}}, {{SMU|U-66||2}}, and {{SMU|U-70||2}}\u2014were given orders first to patrol in the central North Sea between 17 and 22 May, and then to take up waiting positions. ''U-43'' and ''U-44'' were stationed in the [[Pentland Firth]], which the Grand Fleet was likely to cross leaving [[Scapa Flow]], while the remainder proceeded to the [[Firth of Forth]], awaiting battlecruisers departing [[Rosyth Dockyard|Rosyth]]. Each boat had an allocated area, within which it could move around as necessary to avoid detection, but was instructed to keep within it. During the initial North Sea patrol the boats were instructed to sail only north\u2013south so that any enemy who chanced to encounter one would believe it was departing or returning from operations on the west coast (which required them to pass around the north of Britain). Once at their final positions, the boats were under strict orders to avoid premature detection that might give away the operation. It was arranged that a coded signal would be transmitted to alert the submarines exactly when the operation commenced: \"Take into account the enemy's forces may be putting to sea\".<ref>Tarrant p. 56-57</ref>\n\nAdditionally, ''UB-27'' was sent out on 20 May with instructions to work its way into the Firth of Forth past [[Isle of May|May Island]]. ''U-46'' was ordered to patrol the coast of [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]], which had been chosen for the diversionary attack, but because of engine problems it was unable to leave port and ''U-47'' was diverted to this task. On 13 May, ''U-72'' was sent to lay mines in the Firth of Forth; on the 23rd, ''U-74'' departed to lay mines in the Moray Firth; and on the 24th, ''U-75'' was dispatched similarly west of the Orkney Islands. ''UB-21'' and ''UB-22'' were sent to patrol the Humber, where (incorrect) reports had suggested the presence of British warships. ''U-22'', ''U-46'' and ''U-67'' were positioned north of Terschelling to protect against intervention by British light forces stationed at Harwich.<ref>Tarrant pp. 57\u201358</ref>\n\nOn 22 May 1916, it was discovered that ''Seydlitz'' was still not watertight after repairs and would not now be ready until the 29th. The ambush submarines were now on station and experiencing difficulties of their own: visibility near the coast was frequently poor due to fog, and sea conditions were either so calm the slightest ripple, as from the periscope, could give away their position, or so rough as to make it very hard to keep the vessel at a steady depth. The British had become aware of unusual submarine activity, and had begun counter patrols that forced the submarines out of position. ''UB-27'' passed Bell Rock on the night of 23 May on its way into the Firth of Forth as planned, but was halted by engine trouble. After repairs it continued to approach, following behind merchant vessels, and reached Largo Bay on 25 May. There the boat became entangled in nets that fouled one of the propellers, forcing it to abandon the operation and return home. ''U-74'' was detected by four armed trawlers on 27 May and sunk {{convert|25|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} south-east of Peterhead. ''U-75'' laid its mines off the Orkney Islands, which, although they played no part in the battle, were responsible later for sinking the cruiser {{HMS|Hampshire|1903|2}} carrying [[Herbert Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]] (head of the army) on a mission to Russia on 5 June. ''U-72'' was forced to abandon its mission without laying any mines when an oil leak meant it was leaving a visible surface trail astern.<ref>Tarrant pp. 58\u201360</ref>\n\n====Zeppelins====\n{{refimprove section|date=May 2017}}\n[[File:Carte Skagerrak-Kattegat2.png|thumb|The throat of the [[Skagerrak]], the strategic gateway to the Baltic and North Atlantic, waters off Jutland, Norway and Sweden]]\nThe Germans maintained a fleet of [[Zeppelin]]s that they used for aerial reconnaissance and occasional bombing raids. The planned raid on Sunderland intended to use Zeppelins to watch out for the British fleet approaching from the north, which might otherwise surprise the raiders.\n\nBy 28 May, strong north-easterly winds meant that it would not be possible to send out the Zeppelins, so the raid again had to be postponed. The submarines could only stay on station until 1 June before their supplies would be exhausted and they had to return, so a decision had to be made quickly about the raid.\n\nIt was decided to use an alternative plan, abandoning the attack on Sunderland but instead sending a patrol of battlecruisers to the [[Skagerrak]], where it was likely they would encounter merchant ships carrying British cargo and British cruiser patrols. It was felt this could be done without air support, because the action would now be much closer to Germany, relying instead on cruiser and torpedo boat patrols for reconnaissance.\n\nOrders for the alternative plan were issued on 28 May, although it was still hoped that last-minute improvements in the weather would allow the original plan to go ahead. The German fleet assembled in the [[Jade (river)|Jade River]] and at [[Wilhelmshaven]] and was instructed to raise steam and be ready for action from midnight on 28 May.<ref>Tarrant p. 61</ref>\n\nBy 14:00 on 30 May, the wind was still too strong and the final decision was made to use the alternative plan. The coded signal \"31 May G.G.2490\" was transmitted to the ships of the fleet to inform them the Skagerrak attack would start on 31 May. The pre-arranged signal to the waiting submarines was transmitted throughout the day from the E-Dienst radio station at [[Brugge]], and the U-boat tender ''Arcona'' anchored at [[Emden]]. Only two of the waiting submarines, {{SMU|U-66||2}} and {{SMU|U-32|Germany|2}}, received the order.<ref>Tarrant pp. 62, 60, 65</ref>\n\n===British response===\nUnfortunately for the German plan, the British had obtained a copy of the main German codebook from the light cruiser {{SMS|Magdeburg||6}}, which had been boarded by the [[Imperial Russian Navy|Russian Navy]] after the ship ran aground in Russian [[territorial waters]] in 1914. German naval radio communications could therefore often be quickly deciphered, and the British [[Admiralty]] usually knew about German activities.\n\nThe British Admiralty's [[Room 40]] maintained [[direction finding]] and interception of German naval signals. It had intercepted and decrypted a German signal on 28 May that provided \"ample evidence that the German fleet was stirring in the North Sea.\"<ref>Stille, Mark. British Dreadnought vs. German Dreadnought: Jutland 1916. 2010. Osprey Publishing.[Page 56]</ref> Further signals were intercepted, and although they were not decrypted it was clear that a major operation was likely. At 11:00 on 30 May, Jellicoe was warned that the German fleet seemed prepared to sail the following morning. By 17:00, the Admiralty had intercepted the signal from Scheer, \"31 May G.G.2490\", making it clear something significant was imminent.<ref>Tarrant pp. 63\u201364</ref>\n\nNot knowing the Germans' objective, Jellicoe and his staff decided to position the fleet to head off any attempt by the Germans to enter the North Atlantic or the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] through the Skagerrak, by taking up a position off Norway where they could potentially cut off any German raid into the shipping lanes of the Atlantic or prevent the Germans from heading into the Baltic. A position further west was unnecessary, as that area of the [[North Sea]] could be patrolled by air using blimps and scouting aircraft.{{citation needed|date = May 2012}}\n\n[[File:John Jellicoe, Admiral of the Fleet.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Jellicoe, 1st Earl Jellicoe|John Jellicoe]], British fleet commander]]\nConsequently, Admiral Jellicoe led the sixteen dreadnought battleships of the 1st and 4th Battle Squadrons of the Grand Fleet and three battlecruisers of the 3rd Battlecruiser Squadron eastwards out of [[Scapa Flow]] at 22:30 on 30 May. He was to meet the 2nd Battle Squadron of eight dreadnought battleships commanded by Vice-Admiral [[Martyn Jerram]] coming from [[Cromarty]]. Hipper's raiding force did not leave the [[Jade Estuary|Outer Jade Roads]] until 01:00 on 31 May, heading west of Heligoland Island following a cleared channel through the minefields, heading north at {{convert|16|kn|lk=in}}. The main German fleet of sixteen dreadnought battleships of 1st and 3rd Battle Squadrons left the Jade at 02:30, being joined off Heligoland at 04:00 by the six pre-dreadnoughts of the 2nd Battle Squadron coming from the Elbe River. Beatty's faster force of six ships of the 1st and 2nd Battlecruiser Squadrons plus the [[5th Battle Squadron (United Kingdom)#Battle of Jutland|5th Battle Squadron]] of four fast battleships left the Firth of Forth on the next day;{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Jellicoe intended to rendezvous with him {{convert|90|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} west of the mouth of the Skagerrak off the coast of Jutland and wait for the Germans to appear or for their intentions to become clear. The planned position would give him the widest range of responses to likely German moves.<ref>Tarrant p. 64</ref>\n\n==Naval tactics in 1916==\n\nThe principle of [[Force concentration|concentration of force]] was fundamental to the fleet tactics of this time (as in earlier periods). Tactical doctrine called for a fleet approaching battle to be in a compact formation of parallel columns, allowing relatively easy manoeuvring, and giving shortened sight lines within the formation, which simplified the passing of the signals necessary for command and control.<ref name=\"gwpda.org\">http://www.gwpda.org/naval/nr191401.htm</ref>\n\nA fleet formed in several short columns could change its heading faster than one formed in a single long column. Since most command signals were made with [[flag]]s or [[Aldis lamp|signal lamps]] between ships, the flagship was usually placed at the head of the centre column so that its signals might be more easily seen by the many ships of the formation. Wireless telegraphy was in use, though security (radio direction finding), encryption, and the limitation of the radio sets made their extensive use more problematic. Command and control of such huge fleets remained difficult.<ref name=\"gwpda.org\"/><ref>Sutherland, Cramwell, p. 13</ref>\n\nThus, it might take a very long time for a signal from the flagship to be relayed to the entire formation. It was usually necessary for a signal to be confirmed by each ship before it could be relayed to other ships, and an order for a fleet movement would have to be received and acknowledged by every ship before it could be executed. In a large single-column formation, a signal could take 10 minutes or more to be passed from one end of the line to the other, whereas in a formation of parallel columns, visibility across the diagonals was often better (and always shorter) than in a single long column, and the diagonals gave signal \"redundancy\", increasing the probability that a message would be quickly seen and correctly interpreted.<ref name=\"gwpda.org\"/>\n\nHowever, before battle was joined the heavy units of the fleet would, if possible, deploy into a single column. To form the battle line in the correct orientation relative to the enemy, the commanding admiral had to know the enemy fleet's distance, bearing, heading, and speed. It was the task of the scouting forces, consisting primarily of [[battlecruiser]]s and [[cruiser]]s, to find the enemy and report this information in sufficient time, and, if possible, to deny the enemy's scouting forces the opportunity of obtaining the equivalent information.<ref name=\"gwpda.org\"/>\n\nIdeally, the battle line would cross the intended path of the enemy column so that the maximum number of guns could be brought to bear, while the enemy could fire only with the forward guns of the leading ships, a manoeuvre known as \"[[crossing the T]]\". Admiral [[T\u014dg\u014d Heihachir\u014d|T\u014dg\u014d]], commander of the Japanese battleship fleet, had achieved this against Admiral [[Zinovy Rozhestvensky]]'s Russian battleships in 1905 at the [[Battle of Tsushima]], with devastating results.<ref>Forczyk pp. 58\u201362</ref> Jellicoe achieved this twice in one hour against the High Seas Fleet at Jutland, but on both occasions, Scheer managed to turn away and disengage, thereby avoiding a decisive action. {{clear left}}\n\n===Ship design===\nWithin the existing technological limits, a trade-off had to be made between the weight and size of guns, the weight of armour protecting the ship, and the maximum speed. Battleships sacrificed speed for armour and heavy naval guns ({{convert|11|in|mm|abbr=on}} or larger). British battlecruisers sacrificed weight of armour for greater speed, while their German counterparts were armed with lighter guns and heavier armour. These weight savings allowed them to escape danger or catch other ships. Generally, the larger guns mounted on British ships allowed an engagement at greater range. In theory, a lightly armoured ship could stay out of range of a slower opponent while still scoring hits. The fast pace of development in the pre-war years meant that every few years, a new generation of ships rendered its predecessors obsolete. Thus, fairly young ships could still be obsolete compared to the newest ships, and fare badly in an engagement against them.<ref name=\"Castles666\">'Castles of Steel' p. 666</ref>\n\n[[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|Admiral John Fisher]], responsible for reconstruction of the British fleet in the pre-war period, favoured large guns, oil fuel, and speed. [[Alfred von Tirpitz|Admiral Tirpitz]], responsible for the German fleet, favoured ship survivability and chose to sacrifice some gun size for improved armour. The German battlecruiser {{SMS|Derfflinger}} had [[belt armour]] equivalent in thickness\u2014though not as comprehensive\u2014to the British battleship {{HMS|Iron Duke|1912|6}}, significantly better than on the British battlecruisers such as ''Tiger''.

At 03:40, it sighted the cruisers {{HMS|Galatea|1914|6}} and {{HMS|Phaeton|1914|2}} leaving the Forth at {{convert|18|kn}}. It launched one torpedo at the leading cruiser at a range of {{convert|1000|yd|m|abbr=on}}, but its periscope jammed 'up', giving away the position of the submarine as it manoeuvred to fire a second. The lead cruiser turned away to dodge the torpedo, while the second turned towards the submarine, attempting to ram. ''U-32'' [[crash dive]]d, and on raising its periscope at 04:10 saw two battlecruisers (the 2nd Battlecruiser Squadron) heading south-east.

This now brought it into contact with the 2nd Battle Squadron, coming from the Moray Firth. At 05:00, it had to crash dive when the cruiser {{HMS|Duke of Edinburgh||2}} appeared from the mist heading toward it. It was followed by another cruiser, {{HMS|Boadicea|1908|2}}, and eight battleships. ''U-66'' got within {{convert|350|yd|m|abbr=on}} of the battleships preparing to fire, but was forced to dive by an approaching destroyer and missed the opportunity.

It was known to the intelligence staff that Scheer deliberately used a different call sign when at sea, but no one asked for this information or explained the reason behind the query \u2013 to locate the German fleet.<ref>Marder III pp. 41\u201342</ref>\n\nThe German battlecruisers cleared the minefields surrounding the [[Amrum]] swept channel by 09:00. They then proceeded north-west, passing {{convert|35|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} west of the [[Horns Rev|Horn's Reef]] lightship heading for the [[Fisher Bank|Little Fisher Bank]] at the mouth of the Skagerrak. The High Seas Fleet followed some {{convert|50|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} behind. The battlecruisers were in line ahead, with the four cruisers of the II scouting group plus supporting torpedo boats ranged in an arc {{convert|8|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} ahead and to either side.

The High Seas Fleet similarly adopted a line-ahead formation, with close screening by torpedo boats to either side and a further screen of five cruisers surrounding the column {{convert|5|-|8|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} away. The wind had finally moderated so that Zeppelins could be used, and by 11:30 five had been sent out: ''L14'' to the Skagerrak, ''L23'' {{convert|240|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} east of Noss Head in the Pentland Firth, ''L21'' {{convert|120|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} off Peterhead, ''L9'' {{convert|100|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} off Sunderland, and ''L16'' {{convert|80|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} east of Flamborough Head.

His orders were to stop his scouting patrol when he reached a point {{convert|260|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} east of Britain and then turn north to meet Jellicoe, which he did at this time. Beatty's ships were divided into three columns, with the two battlecruiser squadrons leading in parallel lines {{convert|3|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} apart. The 5th Battle Squadron was stationed {{convert|5|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} to the north-west, on the side furthest away from any expected enemy contact, while a screen of cruisers and destroyers was spread south-east of the battlecruisers.

The first shots of the battle were fired at 14:28 when {{HMS|Galatea|1914|6}} and {{HMS|Phaeton|1914|2}} of the British 1st Light [[Cruiser Squadron]] opened on the German torpedo boats, which withdrew toward their approaching light cruisers.

This was the first time in history that a carrier-based aeroplane was used for reconnaissance in naval combat. ''Engadine''{{'}}s aircraft did locate and report some German light cruisers just before 15:30 and came under anti-aircraft gunfire but attempts to relay reports from the aeroplane failed.<ref name=Camp-35>{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |page=35}}</ref>\n\nUnfortunately for Beatty, his initial course changes at 14:32 were not received by [[Hugh Evan-Thomas|Sir Hugh Evan-Thomas's]] 5th Battle Squadron (the distance being too great to read his flags), because the battlecruiser {{HMS|Tiger|1913|6}}\u2014the last ship in his column\u2014was no longer in a position where she could relay signals by searchlight to Evan-Thomas, as she had previously been ordered to do. Whereas before the north turn, ''Tiger'' had been the closest ship to Evan-Thomas, she was now further away than Beatty in ''Lion''. Matters were aggravated because Evan-Thomas had not been briefed regarding standing orders within Beatty's squadron, as his squadron normally operated with the Grand Fleet. Fleet ships were expected to obey movement orders precisely and not deviate from them. Beatty's standing instructions expected his officers to use their initiative and keep station with the flagship.<ref>'Marder' III p. 55</ref> As a result, the four {{sclass-|Queen Elizabeth|battleship|1}}s\u2014which were the fastest and most heavily armed in the world at that time\u2014remained on the previous course for several minutes, ending up {{convert|10|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} behind rather than five.<ref>{{cite book|title=Analysis |last=Campbell |page=32}}</ref> Beatty also had the opportunity during the previous hours to concentrate his forces, and no reason not to do so, whereas he steamed ahead at full speed, faster than the battleships could manage.

He also failed to use the time available to rearrange his battlecruisers into a fighting formation, with the result that they were still manoeuvring when the battle started.<ref>Brooks pp. 234\u2013237</ref>\n\nAt 15:48, with the opposing forces roughly parallel at {{convert|15000|yd|m|abbr=on}}, with the British to the south-west of the Germans (i.e., on the right side), Hipper opened fire, followed by the British ships as their guns came to bear upon targets <span style=\"background:lightblue\">(position 2)</span>. Thus began the opening phase of the battlecruiser action, known as the ''Run to the South'', in which the British chased the Germans, and Hipper intentionally led Beatty toward Scheer. During the first minutes of the ensuing battle, all the British ships except ''Princess Royal'' fired far over their German opponents, due to adverse visibility conditions, before finally getting the range. Only ''Lion'' and ''Princess Royal'' had settled into formation, so the other four ships were hampered in aiming by their own turning. Beatty was to windward of Hipper, and therefore funnel and gun smoke from his own ships tended to obscure his targets, while Hipper's smoke blew clear. Also, the eastern sky was overcast and the grey German ships were indistinct and difficult to range.<ref>{{cite book|title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=38\u201339}}</ref>\n\n[[File:HMS Lion (1910).jpg|thumb|left|[[David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty|Beatty's]] flagship ''Lion'' burning after being hit by a salvo from ''L\u00fctzow'']]\n[[File:HMS Indefatigable sinking.jpg|thumb|left|HMS ''Indefatigable'' sinking after being struck by shells from the German battlecruiser ''Von der Tann'']]\n\nBeatty had ordered his ships to engage in a line, one British ship engaging with one German and his [[flagship]] {{HMS|Lion|1910|6}} doubling on the German flagship {{SMS|L\u00fctzow||6}}. However, due to another mistake with signalling by flag, and possibly because ''Queen Mary'' and ''Tiger'' were unable to see the German lead ship because of smoke,<ref>Brooks p. 239</ref> the second German ship, ''Derfflinger'', was left un-engaged and free to fire without disruption. {{SMS|Moltke||6}} drew fire from two of Beatty's battlecruisers, but still fired with great accuracy during this time, hitting ''Tiger'' 9 times in the first 12 minutes. The Germans drew first blood. Aided by superior visibility, Hipper's five battlecruisers quickly registered hits on three of the six British battlecruisers. Seven minutes passed before the British managed to score their first hit.<ref>{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=39\u201341}}</ref>\n\nThe first near-kill of the Run to the South occurred at 16:00, when a {{convert|30.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} shell from ''L\u00fctzow'' wrecked the \"Q\" turret amidships on Beatty's flagship ''Lion''. Dozens of crewmen were instantly killed, but far larger destruction was averted when the mortally wounded turret commander \u2013 Major [[Francis John William Harvey|Francis Harvey]] of the [[Royal Marines]] \u2013 promptly ordered the magazine doors shut and the magazine flooded. This prevented a magazine explosion at 16:28, when a flash fire ignited ready cordite charges beneath the turret and killed everyone in the chambers outside \"Q\" magazine. ''Lion'' was saved.<ref>{{cite book|title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=64\u201366}}</ref> {{HMS|Indefatigable|1909|6}} was not so lucky; at 16:02, just 14 minutes into the gunnery exchange, she was hit aft by three {{convert|28|cm|in|abbr=on}} shells from {{SMS|Von der Tann||6}}, causing damage sufficient to knock her out of line and detonating \"X\" magazine aft. Soon after, despite the near-maximum range, ''Von der Tann'' put another {{convert|28|cm|in|abbr=on}} shell on ''Indefatigable''{{'}}s \"A\" turret forward. The plunging shells probably pierced the thin upper armour, and seconds later ''Indefatigable'' was ripped apart by another magazine explosion, sinking immediately with her crew of 1,019 officers and men, leaving only two survivors.<ref>{{cite book|title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=60\u201361}}</ref> <span style=\"background:lightblue\">(position 3)</span>.\n\nHipper's position deteriorated somewhat by 16:15 as the 5th Battle Squadron finally came into range, so that he had to contend with gunfire from the four battleships astern as well as Beatty's five remaining battlecruisers to starboard. But he knew his baiting mission was close to completion, as his force was rapidly closing with Scheer's main body. At 16:08, the lead battleship of the 5th Battle Squadron, {{HMS|Barham|04|6}}, caught up with Hipper and opened fire at extreme range, scoring a {{convert|15|in|mm|abbr=on}} hit on ''Von der Tann'' within 60 seconds.

This was the first news that Beatty and Jellicoe had that Scheer and his battle fleet were even at sea. Simultaneously, an all-out destroyer action raged in the space between the opposing battlecruiser forces, as British and German destroyers fought with each other and attempted to torpedo the larger enemy ships. Each side fired many torpedoes, but both battlecruiser forces turned away from the attacks and all escaped harm except ''Seydlitz'', which was hit forward at 16:57 by a torpedo fired by the British destroyer {{HMS|Petard|1916|6}}. Though taking on water, ''Seydlitz'' maintained speed. The destroyer {{HMS|Nestor|1915|6}}, under the command of [[Edward Bingham|Captain Barry Bingham]], led the British attacks. The British disabled the German torpedo boat {{SMS|V27||2}}, which the Germans soon abandoned and sank, and ''Petard'' then torpedoed and sank {{SMS|V29||2}}, her second score of the day. {{SMS|S35||2}} and {{SMS|V26||2}} rescued the crews of their sunken sister ships. But ''Nestor'' and another British destroyer \u2013 {{HMS|Nomad|1916|6}} \u2013 were immobilised by shell hits, and were later sunk by Scheer's passing dreadnoughts. Bingham was rescued, and awarded the Victoria Cross for his leadership in the destroyer action.<ref>{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=50\u201356}}</ref>\n\n===Run to the north===\nAs soon as he himself sighted the vanguard of Scheer's distant battleship line {{convert|12|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} away, at 16:40, Beatty turned his battlecruiser force 180\u00b0, heading north to draw the Germans toward Jellicoe.<ref>{{cite book|title=Analysis |last=Campbell |page=52}}</ref> <span style=\"background:lightblue\">(position 5)</span>. Beatty's withdrawal toward Jellicoe is called the \"Run to the North\", in which the tables turned and the Germans chased the British. Because Beatty once again failed to signal his intentions adequately, the battleships of the 5th Battle Squadron \u2013 which were too far behind to read his flags \u2013 found themselves passing the battlecruisers on an opposing course and heading directly toward the approaching main body of the High Seas Fleet. At 16:48, at extreme range, Scheer's leading battleships opened fire.<ref name=Camp-54>{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |page=54}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, at 16:47, having received Goodenough's signal and knowing that Beatty was now leading the German battle fleet north to him, Jellicoe signalled to his own forces that the fleet action they had waited so long for was finally imminent; at 16:51, by radio, he informed the Admiralty so in London.<ref>{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=58\u201359}}</ref>\n\nThe difficulties of the 5th Battle Squadron were compounded when Beatty gave the order to Evan-Thomas to \"turn in succession\" (rather than \"turn together\") at 16:48 as the battleships passed him. Evan-Thomas acknowledged the signal, but [[Lieutenant-Commander]] [[Ralph Seymour (naval officer)|Ralph Seymour]], Beatty's [[flag lieutenant]], aggravated the situation when he did not haul down the flags (to execute the signal) for some minutes. At 16:55, when the 5BS had moved within range of the enemy battleships, Evan-Thomas issued his own flag command warning his squadron to expect sudden manoeuvres and to follow his lead, before starting to turn on his own initiative. The order to turn in succession would have resulted in all four ships turning in the same patch of sea as they reached it one by one, giving the High Seas Fleet repeated opportunity with ample time to find the proper range. However, the captain of the trailing ship ({{HMS|Malaya}}) turned early, mitigating the adverse results.<ref name=Camp-54/><ref>Massie, pp. 600\u2013601</ref>\n\nFor the next hour, the 5th Battle Squadron acted as Beatty's rearguard, drawing fire from all the German ships within range, while by 17:10 Beatty had deliberately eased his own squadron out of range of Hipper's now-superior battlecruiser force.<ref>{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=96\u201397}}</ref> Since visibility and firepower now favoured the Germans, there was no incentive for Beatty to risk further battlecruiser losses when his own gunnery could not be effective. Illustrating the imbalance, Beatty's battlecruisers did not score any hits on the Germans in this phase until 17:45,<ref>{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |page=135 }}</ref> but they had rapidly received five more before he opened the range (four on ''Lion'', of which three were by ''L\u00fctzow'', and one on ''Tiger'' by ''Seydlitz'').<ref>{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=124\u2013125, 145}}</ref> Now the only targets the Germans could reach, the ships of the 5th Battle Squadron, received simultaneous fire from Hipper's battlecruisers to the east (which HMS ''Barham'' and {{HMS|Valiant|1914|2}} engaged) and Scheer's leading battleships to the south-east (which {{HMS|Warspite|03|6}} and {{HMS|Malaya||2}} engaged).<ref>{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |page=100}}</ref> Three took hits: ''Barham'' (four by ''Derfflinger''), ''Warspite'' (two by ''Seydlitz''), and ''Malaya'' (seven by the German battleships).

At the same time, the {{convert|15|in|mm|abbr=on}} fire of the four British ships was accurate and effective. As the two British squadrons headed north at top speed, eagerly chased by the entire German fleet, the 5th Battle Squadron scored 13 hits on the enemy battlecruisers (four on ''L\u00fctzow'', three on ''Derfflinger'', six on ''Seydlitz'') and five on battleships (although only one, on {{SMS|Markgraf||6}}, did any serious damage).<ref>{{cite book|title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=134\u2013145}}</ref> <span style=\"background:lightblue\">(position 6)</span>.\n\n===The fleets converge===\nJellicoe was now aware that full fleet engagement was nearing, but had insufficient information on the position and course of the Germans. To assist Beatty, early in the battle at about 16:05, Jellicoe had ordered [[Rear-Admiral]] [[Horace Hood]]'s [[3rd Battlecruiser Squadron]] to speed ahead to find and support Beatty's force, and Hood was now racing SSE well in advance of Jellicoe's northern force.<ref>{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |page=59}}</ref> [[Sir Robert Arbuthnot, 4th Baronet|Rear-Admiral Arbuthnot]]'s 1st Cruiser Squadron patrolled the van of Jellicoe's main battleship force as it advanced steadily to the south-east.\n\nAt 17:33, the armoured cruiser {{HMS|Black Prince|1904|6}} of Arbuthnot's squadron, on the far southwest flank of Jellicoe's force, came within view of {{HMS|Falmouth|1910|6}}, which was about {{convert|5|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} ahead of Beatty with the 3rd Light Cruiser Squadron, establishing the first visual link between the converging bodies of the Grand Fleet.<ref>{{cite book|title=Analysis |last=Campbell |page=118}}</ref> At 17:38, the scout cruiser {{HMS|Chester|1915|6}}, screening Hood's oncoming battlecruisers, was intercepted by the van of the German scouting forces under Rear-Admiral Boedicker.<ref>{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |page=111}}</ref>\n\nHeavily outnumbered by Boedicker's four light cruisers, ''Chester'' was pounded before being relieved by Hood's heavy units, which swung westward for that purpose. Hood's flagship {{HMS|Invincible|1907|6}} disabled the light cruiser {{SMS|Wiesbaden||6}} shortly after 17:56. ''Wiesbaden'' became a sitting target for most of the British fleet during the next hour, but remained afloat and fired some torpedoes at the passing enemy battleships from long range. Meanwhile, Boedicker's other ships turned toward Hipper and Scheer in the mistaken belief that Hood was leading a larger force of British capital ships from the north and east. A chaotic destroyer action in mist and smoke ensued as German torpedo boats attempted to blunt the arrival of this new formation, but Hood's battlecruisers dodged all the torpedoes fired at them. In this action, after leading a torpedo counter-attack, the British destroyer {{HMS|Shark|1912|6}} was disabled, but continued to return fire at numerous passing enemy ships for the next hour.<ref>{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=111\u2013115}}</ref>\n\n==Fleet action==\n\n===Deployment===\n\n[[File:Jutland fleet action.png|right|thumb|upright=1.5|(1) 18:00 Scouting forces rejoin their respective fleets.<br />(2) 18:15 British fleet deploys into battle line <br />(3) 18:30 German fleet under fire turns away<br />(4) 19:00 German fleet turns back<br />(5) 19:15 German fleet turns away for second time <br />(6) 20:00<br />(7) 21:00 Nightfall: Jellicoe assumes night cruising formation]]\nIn the meantime, Beatty and Evan-Thomas had resumed their engagement with Hipper's battlecruisers, this time with the visual conditions to their advantage. With several of his ships damaged, Hipper turned back toward Scheer at around 18:00, just as Beatty's flagship ''Lion'' was finally sighted from Jellicoe's flagship ''Iron Duke''. Jellicoe twice demanded the latest position of the German battlefleet from Beatty, who could not see the German battleships and failed to respond to the question until 18:14. Meanwhile, Jellicoe received confused sighting reports of varying accuracy and limited usefulness from light cruisers and battleships on the starboard (southern) flank of his force.<ref name=Camp-120>{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=120\u2013121}}</ref>\n\nJellicoe was in a worrying position. He needed to know the location of the German fleet to judge when and how to deploy his battleships from their cruising formation (six columns of four ships each) into a single battle line. The deployment could be on either the westernmost or the easternmost column, and had to be carried out before the Germans arrived; but early deployment could mean losing any chance of a decisive encounter. Deploying to the west would bring his fleet closer to Scheer, gaining valuable time as dusk approached, but the Germans might arrive before the manoeuvre was complete. Deploying to the east would take the force away from Scheer, but Jellicoe's ships might be able to [[crossing the T|cross the \"T\"]], and visibility would strongly favour British gunnery \u2013 Scheer's forces would be silhouetted against the setting sun to the west, while the Grand Fleet would be indistinct against the dark skies to the north and east, and would be hidden by reflection of the low sunlight off intervening haze and smoke. Deployment would take twenty irreplaceable minutes, and the fleets were closing at full speed. In one of the most critical and difficult tactical command decisions of the entire war, Jellicoe ordered deployment to the east at 18:15.<ref name=Camp-120/><ref>{{cite book |title=Castles |last=Massie |pages=612\u2013613}}</ref>\n\n===Windy Corner===\nMeanwhile, Hipper had rejoined Scheer, and the combined High Seas Fleet was heading north, directly toward Jellicoe. Scheer had no indication that Jellicoe was at sea, let alone that he was bearing down from the north-west, and was distracted by the intervention of Hood's ships to his north and east. Beatty's four surviving battlecruisers were now crossing the van of the British dreadnoughts to join Hood's three battlecruisers; at this time, Arbuthnot's flagship, the armoured cruiser {{HMS|Defence|1907|6}}, and her squadron-mate {{HMS|Warrior|1905|6}} both charged across Beatty's bows, and ''Lion'' narrowly avoided a collision with ''Warrior''.<ref>{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |page=115}}</ref> Nearby, numerous British light cruisers and destroyers on the south-western flank of the deploying battleships were also crossing each other's courses in attempts to reach their proper stations, often barely escaping collisions, and under fire from some of the approaching German ships. This period of peril and heavy traffic attending the merger and deployment of the British forces later became known as \"Windy Corner\".<ref>Massie, p. 614</ref>\n\nArbuthnot was attracted by the drifting hull of the crippled ''Wiesbaden''. With ''Warrior'', ''Defence'' closed in for the kill, only to blunder right into the gun sights of Hipper's and Scheer's oncoming capital ships. ''Defence'' was deluged by heavy-calibre gunfire from many German battleships, which detonated her magazines in a spectacular explosion viewed by most of the deploying Grand Fleet. She sank with all hands (903 officers and men). ''Warrior'' was also hit badly, but was spared destruction by a mishap to the nearby battleship ''Warspite''. ''Warspite'' had her steering gear overheat and jam under heavy load at high speed as the 5th Battle Squadron made a turn to the north at 18:19.<ref>{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=153, 179}}</ref> Steaming at top speed in wide circles, ''Warspite'' appeared as a juicy target to the German dreadnoughts and took 13 hits, inadvertently drawing fire from the hapless ''Warrior''. ''Warspite'' was brought back under control and survived the onslaught, but was badly damaged, had to reduce speed, and withdrew northward; later (at 21:07), she was ordered back to port by Evan-Thomas.<ref>{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |page=259}}</ref> ''Warspite'' went on to a long and illustrious career, serving also in World War II. ''Warrior'', on the other hand, was abandoned and sank the next day after her crew was taken off at 08:25 on 1 June by ''Engadine'', which towed the sinking armoured cruiser {{convert|100|mi|nmi km|abbr=on}} during the night.<ref>{{cite book|title=Analysis |last=Campbell |page=319}}</ref>\n\n[[File:InvincibleBlowingUpJutland1916.jpg|thumb|left|''Invincible'' blowing up after being struck by shells from ''L\u00fctzow'' and ''Derfflinger'']]\nAs ''Defence'' sank and ''Warspite'' circled, at about 18:19, Hipper moved within range of Hood's 3rd Battlecruiser Squadron, but was still also within range of Beatty's ships. At first, visibility favoured the British: {{HMS|Indomitable|1907|6}} hit ''Derfflinger'' three times and ''Seydlitz'' once,<ref>{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=185\u2013187}}</ref> while ''L\u00fctzow'' quickly took 10 hits from ''Lion'', {{HMS|Inflexible|1907|2}} and ''Invincible'', including two below-waterline hits forward by ''Invincible'' that would ultimately doom Hipper's flagship.<ref>{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |page=183}}</ref> But at 18:30, ''Invincible'' abruptly appeared as a clear target before ''L\u00fctzow'' and ''Derfflinger''. The two German ships then fired three salvoes each at ''Invincible'', and sank her in 90 seconds. A {{convert|30.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} shell from the third salvo struck ''Invincible''{{'}}s Q-turret amidships, detonating the magazines below and causing her to blow up and sink. All but six of her crew of 1,032 officers and men, including Rear-Admiral Hood, were killed.<ref>{{cite book|title=Analysis |last=Campbell |page=159}}</ref> Of the remaining British battlecruisers, only ''Princess Royal'' received heavy-calibre hits at this time (two {{convert|30.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} by the battleship ''Markgraf''). ''L\u00fctzow'', flooding forward and unable to communicate by radio, was now out of action and began to attempt to withdraw; therefore Hipper left his flagship and transferred to the torpedo boat {{SMS|G39||6}}, hoping to board one of the other battlecruisers later.\n\n===Crossing the T===\nBy 18:30, the main battle fleet action was joined for the first time, with Jellicoe effectively \"crossing Scheer's T\". The officers on the lead German battleships, and Scheer himself, were taken completely by surprise when they emerged from drifting clouds of smoky mist to suddenly find themselves facing the massed firepower of the entire Grand Fleet main battle line, which they did not know was even at sea.<ref name=Massie-621>{{cite book |title=Castles |last=Massie |page=621}}</ref> Jellicoe's flagship ''Iron Duke'' quickly scored seven hits on the lead German dreadnought, {{SMS|K\u00f6nig||6}} but in this brief exchange, which lasted only minutes, as few as 10 of the Grand Fleet's 24 dreadnoughts actually opened fire.<ref>{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=187\u2013188}}</ref> The Germans were hampered by poor visibility, in addition to being in an unfavourable tactical position, just as Jellicoe had intended. Realising he was heading into a death trap, Scheer ordered his fleet to turn and disengage at 18:33. Under a pall of smoke and mist, Scheer's forces succeeded in disengaging by an expertly executed 180\u00b0 turn in unison (\"battle about turn to starboard\", German ''Gefechtskehrtwendung nach Steuerbord''), which was a well-practised emergency manoeuvre of the High Seas Fleet.<ref>{{cite book |title=Castles |last=Massie |page=622}}</ref> Scheer declared:\n\n{{bquote |It was now obvious that we were confronted by a large portion of the English fleet.

Starting at 18:40, battleships at the rear of Jellicoe's line were in fact sighting and avoiding torpedoes, and at 18:54 {{HMS|Marlborough|1912|6}} was hit by a torpedo (probably from the disabled ''Wiesbaden''), which reduced her speed to {{convert|16|kn}}.<ref>{{cite book|title=Analysis |last=Campbell |page=167}}</ref> Meanwhile, Scheer, knowing that it was not yet dark enough to escape and that his fleet would suffer terribly in a stern chase, doubled back to the east at 18:55. In his memoirs he wrote, \"the manoeuvre would be bound to surprise the enemy, to upset his plans for the rest of the day, and if the blow fell heavily it would facilitate the breaking loose at night.\" But the turn to the east took his ships, again, directly towards Jellicoe's fully deployed battle line.<ref>{{cite book |title=Castles |last=Massie |pages=624\u2013625}}</ref>\n\nSimultaneously, the disabled British destroyer HMS ''Shark'' fought desperately against a group of four German torpedo boats and disabled {{SMS|V48||2}} with gunfire, but was eventually torpedoed and sunk at 19:02 by the German destroyer {{SMS|S54||2}}.

By 19:15, Jellicoe had crossed Scheer's \"T\" again. This time his arc of fire was tighter and deadlier, causing severe damage to the German battleships, particularly Rear-Admiral Behncke's leading 3rd Squadron (SMS ''K\u00f6nig'', {{SMS|Grosser Kurf\u00fcrst|1913|2}}, ''Markgraf'', and {{SMS|Kaiser|1911|2}} all being hit, along with {{SMS|Helgoland||6}} of the 1st Squadron),<ref name=Camp-246>{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |page=246}}</ref> while on the British side, only the battleship {{HMS|Colossus|1910|6}} was hit (twice, by {{SMS|Seydlitz||6}} but with little damage done).<ref>{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |page=218}}</ref>\n\nAt 19:17, for the second time in less than an hour, Scheer turned his outnumbered and out-gunned fleet to the west using the \"battle about turn\" (German: ''Gefechtskehrtwendung''), but this time it was executed only with difficulty, as the High Seas Fleet's lead squadrons began to lose formation under concentrated gunfire.<ref>{{cite book |title=Analysis |last=Campbell |pages=200\u2013201}}</ref> To deter a British chase, Scheer ordered a major torpedo attack by his destroyers and a potentially sacrificial charge by Scouting Group I's four remaining battlecruisers.

Had the other messages been forwarded, which confirmed the information received at 23:15, or had British ships reported accurately sightings and engagements with German destroyers, cruisers and battleships, then Jellicoe could have altered course to intercept Scheer at the Horns Reef.

News that ''L\u00fctzow'', ''Elbing'' and ''Rostock'' had been scuttled was withheld, on the grounds this information would not be known to the enemy. The victory of the Skagerrak was celebrated in the press, children were given a holiday and the nation celebrated. The Kaiser announced a new chapter in world history. Post-war, the official German history hailed the battle as a victory and it continued to be celebrated until after World War II.<ref>Tarrant pp. 274\u2013276</ref>\n\nIn Britain, the first official news came from German wireless broadcasts. Ships began to arrive in port, their crews sending messages to friends and relatives both of their survival and the loss of some 6,000 others. The authorities considered suppressing the news, but it had already spread widely. Some crews coming ashore found rumours had already reported them dead to relatives, while others were jeered for the defeat they had suffered.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.familyletters.co.uk/21-june-1916-paul-to-ted/|title=21 June 1916 \u2013 Paul to Ted|date=1 June 2016|newspaper=familyletters.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=13 January 2017}}</ref> At 19:00 on 2 June, the Admiralty released a statement based on information from Jellicoe containing the bare news of losses on each side.

On 3 June, the Admiralty issued a further statement expanding on German losses, and another the following day with exaggerated claims. However, on 7 June the German admission of the losses of  ''L\u00fctzow'' and ''Rostock'' started to redress the sense of the battle as a loss. International perception of the battle began to change towards a qualified British victory, the German attempt to change the balance of power in the North Sea having been repulsed. In July, bad news from the ''[[Battle of the Somme|Somme campaign]]'' swept concern over Jutland from the British consciousness.<ref>Steele & Hart pp. 421\u2013422</ref>\n\n===Assessments===\n\n[[File:SMS Seydlitz damage.jpg|thumb|left|SMS ''Seydlitz'' was heavily damaged in the battle, hit by twenty-one main calibre shells, several secondary calibre and one torpedo. 98 men were killed and 55 injured.]]\nAt Jutland, the Germans, with a 99-strong fleet, sank {{convert|115000|LT|t|abbr=on}} of British ships, while a 151-strong British fleet sank {{convert|62000|LT|t|abbr=on}} of German ships. The British lost 6,094 seamen; the Germans 2,551. Several other ships were badly damaged, such as {{HMS|Lion|1910|2}} and {{SMS|Seydlitz||2}}.\n\nAs of the summer of 1916, the High Seas Fleet's strategy was to whittle away the numerical advantage of the Royal Navy by bringing its full strength to bear against isolated squadrons of enemy capital ships whilst declining to be drawn into a general fleet battle until it had achieved something resembling parity in heavy ships. In tactical terms, the High Seas Fleet had clearly inflicted significantly greater losses on the Grand Fleet than it had suffered itself at Jutland and the Germans never had any intention of attempting to hold the site of the battle,<ref name=\"suth\">{{cite book |author=Sutherland & Canwell |title=The Battle of Jutland |publisher=Pen & Sword |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-84415-529-3}}</ref> so some historians support the German claim of victory at Jutland.\n\nHowever, Scheer seems to have quickly realised that further battles with a similar rate of attrition would exhaust the High Seas Fleet long before it reduced the Grand Fleet.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}  Further, after the 19 August advance was nearly intercepted by the Grand Fleet, he no longer believed that it would be possible to trap a single squadron of Royal Navy warships without having the Grand Fleet intervene before he could return to port. Therefore, the High Seas Fleet abandoned its forays into the North Sea and turned its attention to the Baltic for most of 1917 whilst Scheer switched tactics against Britain to unrestricted submarine warfare in the Atlantic.\n\nAt a strategic level, the outcome has been the subject of a huge amount of literature with no clear consensus. The battle was widely viewed as indecisive in the immediate aftermath and this view remains influential.\n\nDespite numerical superiority, the British had been disappointed in their hopes for a decisive victory {{citation needed|date=May 2016}} comparable to [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]] and the objective of the influential strategic doctrines of [[Alfred Mahan]]. The High Seas Fleet survived as a [[fleet in being]]. Most of its losses were made good within a month \u2013 even ''Seydlitz'', the most badly damaged ship to survive the battle, was repaired by October and officially back in service by November. However, the Germans had failed in their objective of destroying a substantial portion of the British Fleet, and no progress had been made towards the goal of allowing the High Seas Fleet to operate in the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nSubsequently, there has been considerable support for the view of Jutland as a strategic victory for the British. While the British had not destroyed the German fleet and had lost more ships than their enemy, the Germans had retreated to harbour; at the end of the battle the British were in command of the area.\n\nThe German fleet would only sortie into the North Sea thrice more, with a [[Action of 19 August 1916|raid on 19 August]], one in October 1916 and another in April 1918. All three were unopposed by capital ships and quickly aborted as neither side were prepared to take the risks of mines and submarines.\n\nApart from these three abortive operations the High Seas Fleet \u2013 unwilling to risk another encounter with the British fleet \u2013 confined its activities to the Baltic Sea for the remainder of the war. Jellicoe issued an order prohibiting the Grand Fleet from steaming south of the line of Horns Reef owing to the threat of mines and U-boats.<ref>Massie, ''Castles'', p. 684</ref> A German naval expert, writing publicly about Jutland in November 1918, commented, \"Our Fleet losses were severe.

As a result, some German ships with only {{convert|8|in|cm|abbr=on}}-thick armour survived hits from {{convert|15|in|cm|adj=on}} projectiles. Had these shells penetrated the armour and then exploded, German losses would probably have been far greater.\n* Communication between ships and the British commander-in-chief were comparatively poor. For most of the battle, Jellicoe had no idea where the German ships were, even though British ships were in contact. They failed to report enemy positions, contrary to the Grand Fleet's Battle Plan. Some of the most important signalling was carried out solely by flag instead of wireless or using redundant methods to ensure communications\u2014a questionable procedure, given the mixture of haze and smoke that obscured the battlefield, and a foreshadowing of similar failures by habit-bound and conservatively minded professional officers of rank to take advantage of new technology in World War II.\n\n====Shell performance====\nGerman [[Armour-piercing shot and shell|armour-piercing shells]] were far more effective than the British ones, which often failed to penetrate heavy armour.<ref>Campbell, pp. 386\u2013387</ref> The issue particularly concerned shells striking at oblique angles, which became increasingly the case at long range.<ref>Marder III p. 170</ref> Germany had adopted [[trinitrotoluene]] (TNT) as the explosive filler for artillery shells in 1902, while the United Kingdom was still using a [[picric acid]] mixture (Lyddite). The shock of impact of a shell against armour often prematurely detonated Lyddite in advance of [[fuze]] function while TNT detonation could be delayed until after the shell had penetrated and the fuze had functioned in the vulnerable area behind the armour plate.<ref>Brown, pp. 151\u2013152</ref> Some 17 British shells hit the side armour of the German dreadnoughts or battlecruisers. Of these, four would not have penetrated under any circumstances. Of the remaining 13, one penetrated the armour and exploded inside. This showed a 7.5 per cent chance of proper shell function on the British side, a result of overly brittle shells and Lyddite exploding too soon.<ref>Campbell, pp. 386\u2013388</ref>\n\nThe issue of poorly performing shells had been known to Jellicoe, who as Third Sea Lord from 1908 to 1910 had ordered new shells to be designed. However, the matter had not been followed through after his posting to sea and new shells had never been thoroughly tested.<ref>'Castles' p. 61.</ref> Beatty discovered the problem at a party aboard ''Lion'' a short time after the battle, when a Swedish Naval officer was present. He had recently visited Berlin, where the German navy had scoffed at how British shells had broken up on their ships' armour.<ref name=Castles668>'Castles' p. 668</ref> The question of shell effectiveness had also been raised after the [[Battle of Dogger Bank (1915)|Battle of Dogger Bank]], but no action had been taken.<ref name=\"Marder\">Marder III p. 171</ref> Hipper later commented, \"It was nothing but the poor quality of their bursting charges which saved us from disaster.\"<ref>'Castles' p. 671 citing Marder Vol. III p. 81</ref>\n\nAdmiral Dreyer, writing later about the battle, during which he had been captain of the British flagship ''Iron Duke'', estimated that effective shells as later introduced would have led to the sinking of six more German capital ships, based upon the actual number of hits achieved in the battle.<ref>Marder p. 169</ref> The system of testing shells, which remained in use up to 1944, meant that, statistically, a batch of shells of which 70% were faulty stood an even chance of being accepted. Indeed, even shells that failed this relatively mild test had still been issued to ships. Analysis of the test results afterwards by the Ordnance Board suggested the likelihood that 30\u201370% of shells would not have passed the standard penetration test specified by the Admiralty.<ref name=\"Marder\" />\n\nEfforts to replace the shells were initially resisted by the Admiralty, and action was not taken until Jellicoe became First Sea Lord in December 1916. As an initial response, the worst of the existing shells were withdrawn from ships in early 1917 and replaced from reserve supplies.<ref>Marder III, p. 215</ref> New shells were designed, but did not arrive until April 1918, and were never used in action.<ref name=Castles668/>\n\n====Battlecruiser losses====\nBritish battlecruisers were designed to chase and destroy enemy cruisers from out of the range of those ships. They were not designed to be [[ship of the line|ships of the line]] and exchange [[broadside]]s with the enemy. One German and three British battlecruisers were sunk\u2014but none were destroyed by enemy shells penetrating the belt armour and detonating the magazines. Each of the British battlecruisers was penetrated through a turret roof and her magazines ignited by flash fires passing through the turret and shell-handling rooms.<ref>{{cite book |title=Castles |last=Massie |pages=666\u2013667}}</ref> ''L\u00fctzow'' sustained 24 hits and her flooding could not be contained.

Of this there can be no question. But it is also undoubted that the gunnery of the German battle-cruisers in the early stages was of a very high standard.|Sir John Jellicoe|''Jellicoe's official despatch''<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.gwpda.org/naval/jut02.htm |title=Battle of Jutland \u2013 Jellicoe's Despatch |publisher=referencing ''Battle of Jutland \u2013 Official Despatches with Appendicies'', \"Presented to Parliament by Command of His Majesty, His Majesty's Stationery Office, 1920}}</ref>}}\n\nJellicoe and Beatty, as well as other senior officers, gave an impression that the loss of the battlecruisers was caused by weak armour, despite reports by two committees and earlier statements by Jellicoe and other senior officers that Cordite and its management were to blame. This led to calls for armour to be increased, and an additional {{convert|1|in|cm|abbr=on}} was placed over the relatively thin decks above magazines. To compensate for the increase in weight, ships had to carry correspondingly less fuel, water and other supplies. Whether or not thin deck armour was a potential weakness of British ships, the battle provided no evidence that it was the case. At least amongst the surviving ships, no enemy shell was found to have penetrated deck armour anywhere.<ref>Marder III p. 218</ref> The design of the new battlecruiser {{HMS|Hood|51|6}} (which had started building at the time of the battle) was altered to give her {{convert|5000|LT|t|abbr=on}} of additional armour.<ref>Marder III p. 219</ref>\n\n====Ammunition handling====\nBritish and German [[propellant]] charges differed in packaging, handling, and chemistry. The British propellant was of two types, MK1 and MD. The Mark 1 cordite had a formula of 37% nitrocellulose, 58% nitroglycerine, and 5% petroleum jelly. It was a good propellant but burned hot and caused an erosion problem in gun barrels. The petroleum jelly served as both a lubricant and a stabiliser. Cordite MD was developed to reduce barrel wear, its formula being 65% nitrocellulose, 30% nitroglycerine, and 5% petroleum jelly. While cordite MD solved the gun-barrel erosion issue, it did nothing to improve its storage properties, which were poor. Cordite was very sensitive to variations of temperature, and acid propagation/cordite deterioration would take place at a very rapid rate. Cordite MD also shed micro-dust particles of nitrocellulose and iron pyrite.<ref name=\"navweaps.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.navweaps.com/index_tech/tech-100.htm|title=Naval Propellants \u2013 A Brief Overview|author=Tony DiGiulian|publisher=navweaps.com|accessdate=27 May 2014}}</ref>  While cordite propellant was manageable, it required a vigilant gunnery officer, strict cordite lot control, and frequent testing of the cordite lots in the ships' magazines.<ref name=\"worldwar1.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwar1.co.uk/grant.htm|title=Battle of Jutland, Memoir \u2013 World War 1 Naval Combat|publisher=worldwar1.co.uk|accessdate=27 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nBritish [[cordite]] propellant (when uncased and exposed in the silk bag) tended to burn violently, causing uncontrollable \"flash fires\" when ignited by nearby shell hits. In 1945, a test was conducted by the U.S.N. Bureau of Ordnance (Bulletin of Ordnance Information, No.245, pp.&nbsp;54\u201360)<ref name=\"warship\">{{cite web|url=http://www.warship.org/loss_of_hms_hood__part_3.htm#68 |title=Loss of HMS Hood&nbsp; Part 3 |publisher=warship.org |accessdate=27 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150111072209/http://www.warship.org/loss_of_hms_hood__part_3.htm |archivedate=11 January 2015 }}</ref> testing the sensitivity of cordite to then-current U.S. Naval propellant powders against a measurable and repeatable flash source. It found that cordite would ignite at 530&nbsp;mm/22\" from the flash, the current U.S. powder at 120&nbsp;mm, /5\", and the U.S. flashless powder at 25&nbsp;mm./1\"/\n\nThis meant that about 75 times the propellant would immediately ignite when exposed to flash, as compared to the U.S. powder. British ships had inadequate protection against these flash fires. German propellant (''RP C/12'', handled in brass cartridge cases) was less vulnerable and less volatile in composition.<ref>Campbell, pp. 377\u2013378</ref>  German propellants were not that different in composition from cordite\u2014with one major exception: [[centralite]]. This was symmetrical Diethyl Diphenyl Urea, which served as a stabiliser that was superior to the petroleum jelly used in British practice. It stored better and burned but did not explode. Stored and used in brass cases, it proved much less sensitive to flash. RP C/12 was composed of 64.13% nitrocellulose, 29.77% nitroglycerine, 5.75% centralite, 0.25% magnesium oxide and 0.10% graphite.<ref name=\"navweaps.com\" />\n\nThe Royal Navy Battle Cruiser Fleet had also emphasised speed in ammunition handling over established safety protocol. In practice drills, cordite could not be supplied to the guns rapidly enough through the hoists and hatches. To bring up the propellant in good time to load for the next broadside, many safety doors were kept open that should have been shut to safeguard against flash fires. Bags of cordite were also stocked and kept locally, creating a total breakdown of safety design features. By staging charges in the chambers between the gun turret and magazine, the Royal Navy enhanced their rate of fire but left their ships vulnerable to chain reaction ammunition fires and magazine explosions.<ref name=\"worldwar1.co.uk\"/><ref>Campbell, pp. 371\u2013372</ref> This 'bad safety habit' carried over into real battle practices.<ref name=\"worldwar1.co.uk\"/> Furthermore, the doctrine of a high rate of fire also led to the decision in 1913 to increase the supply of shells and cordite held on the British ships by 50%, for fear of running out of ammunition. When this exceeded the capacity of the ships' magazines, cordite was stored in insecure places.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Lambert |title=Bloody Ships |page=36}}</ref>\n\nThe British cordite charges were stored two silk bags to a metal cylindrical container, with a 16-oz gunpowder igniter charge, which was covered with a thick paper wad, four charges being used on each projectile. The gun crews were removing the charges from their containers and removing the paper covering over the gunpowder igniter charges. The effect of having eight loads at the ready was to have {{convert|4|ST|kg|abbr=on}} of exposed explosive, with each charge leaking small amounts of gunpowder from the igniter bags. In effect, the gun crews had laid an explosive train from the turret to the magazines, and one shell hit to a battlecruiser turret was enough to end a ship.<ref>British Battlecruisers 1914\u201318, Lawrence Burr, Tony Bryan pp. 41\u201342</ref>\n\nA diving expedition during the summer of 2003 provided corroboration of this practice. It examined the wrecks of ''Invincible'', ''Queen Mary'', ''Defence'', and ''L\u00fctzow'' to investigate the cause of the British ships' tendency to suffer from internal explosions. From this evidence, a major part of the blame may be laid on lax handling of the cordite propellant for the shells of the main guns. The wreck of the ''Queen Mary'' revealed cordite containers stacked in the working chamber of the X turret instead of the magazine.<ref>British Battlecruisers 1914\u201318, Lawrence Burr, Tony Bryan p. 43</ref>\n\nThere was a further difference in the propellant itself. While the German ''RP C/12'' burned when exposed to fire, it did not explode, as opposed to cordite. ''RP C/12'' was extensively studied by the British and, after World War I, would form the basis of the later Cordite SC.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNGER_projectiles.htm |title=German Ammunition, Guns and Mountings Definitions |accessdate=19 May 2008 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080517110752/http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNGER_projectiles.htm| archivedate= 17 May 2008 | deadurl= no}}</ref>\n\nThe memoirs of Alexander Grant, Gunner on ''Lion'', suggest that some British officers were aware of the dangers of careless handling of cordite:\n\n{{quote|With the introduction of cordite to replace powder for firing guns, regulations regarding the necessary precautions for handling explosives became unconsciously considerably relaxed, even I regret to say, to a dangerous degree throughout the Service. The gradual lapse in the regulations on board ship seemed to be due to two factors. First, cordite is a much safer explosive to handle than gun-powder. Second, but more important, the altered construction of the magazines on board led to a feeling of false security....The iron or steel deck, the disappearance of the wood lining, the electric lights fitted inside, the steel doors, open because there was now no chute for passing cartridges out; all this gave officers and men a comparative easiness of mind regarding the precautions necessary with explosive material.<ref>[http://www.worldwar1.co.uk/grant.htm Memoir of Gunnery Officer Alexander Grant]</ref>}}\n\nGrant had already introduced measures onboard ''Lion'' to limit the number of cartridges kept outside the magazine and to ensure doors were kept closed, probably contributing to her survival.<ref>marder III p. 174</ref>\n\nOn 5 June 1916, the First Lord of the Admiralty advised Cabinet Members that the three battlecruisers had been lost due to unsafe cordite management.<ref name=\"Lawrence Burr p.40\">British Battlecruisers 1914\u201318, Lawrence Burr, Tony Bryan p. 40</ref>\n\nOn 22 November 1916, following detailed interviews of the survivors of the destroyed battlecruisers, the Third Sea Lord, Rear Admiral Tudor, issued a report detailing the stacking of charges by the gun crews in the handling rooms to speed up loading of the guns.<ref name=\"Lawrence Burr p.40\"/>\n\nAfter the battle, the B.C.F.

Because of its demonstrated advantages, it was installed on ships progressively as the war went on, had been fitted to a majority of British capital ships by May 1916, and had been installed on the main guns of all but two of the Grand Fleet's capital ships.<ref>Brooks p. 224</ref> The Royal Navy used centralised [[fire-control system]]s on their capital ships, directed from a point high up on the ship where the fall of shells could best be seen, utilising a director sight for both training and elevating the guns. In contrast, the German battlecruisers controlled the fire of turrets using a training-only director, which also did not fire the guns at once. The rest of the German capital ships were without even this innovation. German range-finding equipment was generally superior to the British {{convert|9|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} FT24, as its operators were trained to a higher standard due to the complexity of the Zeiss {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on}} range finders. Their [[Stereoscopic rangefinder|stereoscopic]] design meant that in certain conditions they could range on a target enshrouded by smoke.<ref>Brooks, pp. 221\u2013222</ref> The German equipment was not superior in range to the British [[Barr & Stroud]] {{convert|15|ft|m|abbr=on}} rangefinder found in the newest British capital ships, and, unlike the British range finders, the German range takers had to be replaced as often as every thirty minutes, as their eyesight became impaired, affecting the ranges provided to their gunnery equipment.<ref>Brooks, p. 223</ref>\n\nThe results of the battle confirmed the value of firing guns by centralised director. The battle prompted the Royal Navy to install director firing systems in cruisers and destroyers, where it had not thus far been used, and for secondary armament on battleships.<ref>Marder III pp. 213\u2013214</ref>\n\nGerman ships were considered to have been quicker in determining the correct range to targets, thus obtaining an early advantage. The British used a 'bracket system', whereby a salvo was fired at the best-guess range and, depending where it landed, the range was progressively corrected up or down until successive shots were landing in front of and behind the enemy. The Germans used a 'ladder system', whereby an initial volley of three shots at different ranges was used, with the centre shot at the best-guess range. The ladder system allowed the gunners to get ranging information from the three shots more quickly than the bracket system, which required waiting between shots to see how the last had landed. British ships adopted the German system.<ref>Marder III pp.166, 214</ref>\n\nIt was determined that {{convert|9|ft|m|adj=on}} range finders of the sort issued to most British ships were not adequate at long range and did not perform as well as the {{convert|15|ft|m|adj=on}} range finders on some of the most modern ships. In 1917, range finders of base lengths of {{convert|25|and|30|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} were introduced on the battleships to improve accuracy.<ref>Marder p. 215</ref>\n\n====Signalling====\nThroughout the battle, British ships experienced difficulties with communications, whereas the Germans did not suffer such problems. The British preferred signalling using ship-to-ship flag and lamp signals, avoiding wireless, whereas the Germans used wireless successfully. One conclusion drawn was that flag signals were not a satisfactory way to control the fleet. Experience using lamps, particularly at night when issuing challenges to other ships, demonstrated this was an excellent way to advertise your precise location to an enemy, inviting a reply by gunfire. Recognition signals by lamp, once seen, could also easily be copied in future engagements.<ref>Marder III pp. 175\u2013176</ref>\n\nBritish ships both failed to report engagements with the enemy but also, in the case of cruisers and destroyers, failed to actively seek out the enemy. A culture had arisen within the fleet of not acting without orders, which could prove fatal when any circumstances prevented orders being sent or received. Commanders failed to engage the enemy because they believed other, more senior officers must also be aware of the enemy nearby, and would have given orders to act if this was expected. Wireless, the most direct way to pass messages across the fleet (although it was being jammed by German ships), was avoided either for perceived reasons of not giving away the presence of ships or for fear of cluttering up the airwaves with unnecessary reports.<ref>Marder III pp. 176\u2013178</ref>\n\n====Fleet Standing Orders====\nNaval operations were governed by standing orders issued to all the ships. These attempted to set out what ships should do in all circumstances, particularly in situations where ships would have to react without referring to higher authority, or when communications failed. A number of changes were introduced as a result of experience gained in the battle.\n\nA new signal was introduced instructing squadron commanders to act independently as they thought best while still supporting the main fleet, particularly for use when circumstances would make it difficult to send detailed orders. The description stressed that this was not intended to be the only time commanders might take independent action, but was intended to make plain times when they definitely should. Similarly, instructions on what to do if the fleet was instructed to take evasive action against torpedoes were amended. Commanders were given discretion that if their part of the fleet was not under immediate attack, they should continue engaging the enemy rather than turning away with the rest of the fleet. In this battle, when the fleet turned away from Scheer's destroyer attack covering his retreat, not all the British ships had been affected, and could have continued to engage the enemy.<ref>MarderIII p. 222</ref>\n\nA number of opportunities to attack enemy ships by torpedo had presented themselves but had been missed. All ships, not just the destroyers armed principally with torpedoes but also battleships, were reminded that they carried torpedoes intended to be used whenever an opportunity arose. Destroyers were instructed to close the enemy fleet to fire torpedoes as soon as engagements between the main ships on either side would keep enemy guns busy directed at larger targets. Destroyers should also be ready to immediately engage enemy destroyers if they should launch an attack, endeavouring to disrupt their chances of launching torpedoes and keep them away from the main fleet.<ref>Marder III pp. 224\u2013225</ref>\n\nTo add some flexibility when deploying for attack, a new signal was provided for deploying the fleet to the centre, rather than as previously only either to left or right of the standard closed-up formation for travelling. The fast and powerful 5th Battle Squadron was moved to the front of the cruising formation so it would have the option of deploying left or right depending upon the enemy position. In the event of engagements at night, although the fleet still preferred to avoid night fighting, a destroyer and cruiser squadron would be specifically detailed to seek out the enemy and launch destroyer attacks.<ref>Marder III p. 226</ref>\n\n==Controversy==\nAt the time, Jellicoe was criticised for his caution and for allowing Scheer to escape.<ref name=Massie-631>Massie, p. 631</ref> Beatty, in particular, was convinced that Jellicoe had missed a tremendous opportunity to annihilate the High Seas Fleet<ref>Massie, p. 670</ref> and win what would amount to another [[battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]]. Jellicoe was promoted away from active command to become First Sea Lord, the professional head of the Royal Navy, while Beatty replaced him as commander of the Grand Fleet.\n\nThe controversy raged within the navy and in public for about a decade after the war. Criticism focused on Jellicoe's decision at 19:15. Scheer had ordered his cruisers and destroyers forward in a torpedo attack to cover the turning away of his battleships. Jellicoe chose to turn to the south-east, and so keep out of range of the torpedoes. Supporters of Jellicoe, including the historian [[Cyril Falls]], pointed to the folly of risking defeat in battle when one already has [[command of the sea]].<ref name=Massie-675>{{cite book |title=Castles |last=Massie |page=675}}</ref> Jellicoe himself, in a letter to the Admiralty seventeen months before the battle, said that he intended to turn his fleet away from any mass torpedo attack (that being the universally accepted proper tactical response to such attacks, practised by all the major navies of the world<ref name=Massie-675/>). He said that, in the event of a fleet engagement in which the enemy turned away, he would assume they intended to draw him over mines or submarines, and he would decline to be so drawn. The Admiralty approved this plan and expressed full confidence in Jellicoe at the time (October 1914).<ref>Massie, p. 632</ref>\n\nThe stakes were high, the pressure on Jellicoe immense, and his caution certainly understandable. His judgement might have been that even 90% odds in favour were not good enough to bet the British Empire. The former [[First Lord of the Admiralty]] [[Winston Churchill]] said of the battle that Jellicoe \"was the only man on either side who could have lost the war in an afternoon.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Castles |last=Massie |page=681}}</ref>\n\nThe criticism of Jellicoe also fails to sufficiently credit Scheer, who was determined to preserve his fleet by avoiding the full British battle line, and who showed great skill in effecting his escape.<ref>{{cite book |title=Castles |last=Massie |page=672}}</ref>\n\n===Beatty's actions===\nOn the other hand, some of Jellicoe's supporters condemned the actions of Beatty for the British failure to achieve a complete victory.<ref>{{cite book |title=Castles |last=Massie |pages=670, 679}}</ref> Although Beatty was undeniably brave, his mismanagement of the initial encounter with Hipper's squadron and the High Seas Fleet cost considerable advantage in the first hours of the battle.<ref>{{cite book |title=Castles |last=Massie |pages=673\u2013674}}</ref> His most glaring failure was in not providing Jellicoe with periodic information on the position, course, and speed of the High Seas Fleet.<ref>{{cite book |title=Castles |last=Massie |page=674}}</ref> Beatty, aboard the battlecruiser ''Lion'', left behind the four fast battleships of the 5th Battle Squadron \u2013 the most powerful warships in the world at the time \u2013 engaging with six ships when better control would have given him 10 against Hipper's five. Though Beatty's larger {{convert|13.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} guns out-ranged Hipper's {{convert|11|and|12|in|mm|abbr=on}} guns by thousands of yards, Beatty held his fire for 10 minutes and closed the German squadron until within range of the Germans' superior gunnery, under lighting conditions that favoured the Germans.<ref>{{cite book|title=Castles |last=Massie |pages=589\u2013590}}</ref> Most of the British losses in tonnage occurred in Beatty's force.\n\n==Death toll==\n{{See also|Damage to major ships at the Battle of Jutland}}\n{{See also|List of ships sunk at the Battle of Jutland}}\nThe total loss of life was 9,823 men, of which the British losses were 6,784 and German losses were 3,039.<ref>Brewers Dictionary of 20th Century Phrase and Fable</ref> Counted among the British losses are 2 members of the [[Royal Australian Navy]], and 1 member of the [[Royal Canadian Navy]]. 6 Australian nationals serving in the Royal Navy were also killed.<ref name=\"Commonwealth\">[http://www.gwpda.org/naval/jutloscm.htm Great War Primary Documents Archive, 2007, \"Battle of Jutland \u2013 Commonwealth Casualties\"] (Access: 24 February 2012).</ref>\n\n===British===\n113,300 [[long ton|tons]] sunk:<ref name=\"Nasmith, pg261\"/>\n* Battlecruisers {{HMS|Indefatigable|1909|2}}, {{HMS|Queen Mary||2}}, {{HMS|Invincible|1907|2}}\n* Armoured cruisers {{HMS|Black Prince|1904|2}}, {{HMS|Warrior|1905|2}}, {{HMS|Defence|1907|2}}\n* Flotilla leader {{HMS|Tipperary|1915|2}}\n* Destroyers {{HMS|Shark|1912|2}}, {{HMS|Sparrowhawk|1912|2}}, {{HMS|Turbulent|1916|2}}, {{HMS|Ardent|1913|2}}, {{HMS|Fortune|1913|2}}, {{HMS|Nomad||2}}, {{HMS|Nestor|1915|2}}\n\n===German===\n62,300 [[long ton|tons]] sunk:<ref name=\"Nasmith, pg261\"/>\n* Battlecruiser {{SMS|L\u00fctzow||2}}\n* Pre-Dreadnought {{SMS|Pommern||2}}\n* Light cruisers {{SMS|Frauenlob||2}}, {{SMS|Elbing||2}}, {{SMS|Rostock||2}}, {{SMS|Wiesbaden||2}}\n* Destroyers (Heavy torpedo-boats) {{SMS|V48||2}}, {{SMS|S35||2}}, {{SMS|V27||2}}, {{SMS|V4||2}}, {{SMS|V29||2}}\n\n==Selected honours==\nThe [[Victoria Cross]] is the highest military decoration awarded for valour \"in the face of the enemy\" to members of the [[British Empire]] armed forces.

It is estimated that about 80 percent of the population of Mali speak Bambara as a first or second language. It has a [[subject\u2013object\u2013verb]] clause structure and two lexical [[tone (tonal language)|tone]]s.\n\n==Classification==\nBambara is a variety of a group of closely related languages called [[Manding languages|Manding]], whose native speakers trace their cultural history to the medieval [[Mali Empire]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mandelang.kunstkamera.ru/files/mandelang/mandekan.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120408104148/http://mandelang.kunstkamera.ru/files/mandelang/mandekan.pdf |archivedate=2012-04-08 |df= }}</ref> Varieties of Manding are generally considered (among native speakers) to be mutually intelligible &ndash; dependent on exposure or familiarity with dialects between speakers &ndash; and spoken by 30 to 40 million people in the countries [[Burkina Faso]], [[Senegal]], [[Guinea-Bissau]], [[Guinea]], [[Liberia]], [[Ivory Coast]] and [[the Gambia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sil.org/SILESR/2000/2000-003/Manding/Manding.htm|title=Mand\u00e9 Language Family: Manding|website=www.sil.org|accessdate=1 January 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121102940/http://www.sil.org/SILESR/2000/2000-003/Manding/Manding.htm|archivedate=21 January 2013|df=}}</ref> Manding is part of the larger [[Mande languages|Mand\u00e9]] family of languages.\n\n==Alphabet and literature==\nIt uses seven vowels a, e, \u025b, i, o, \u0254 and u, each of which can be nasalized, pharyngealized and murmured, giving a total number of 21 vowels (the letters approximate their [[help:IPA|IPA]] equivalents). {{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\nWriting with the latin alphabet began during the [[French West Africa|French]] occupation, and the first orthography was introduced in 1967. Literacy is limited, especially in rural areas. Although written literature is only slowly evolving (due to the predominance of French as the \"language of the educated\"), there exists a wealth of [[oral history|oral literature]], which is often tales of kings and heroes. This oral literature is mainly tradited by the [[griot]]s (''Jeliw'' in Bambara) who are a mixture of [[storytelling|storyteller]]s, praise singers, and human history books who have studied the trade of singing and reciting for many years. Many of their songs are very old and are said to date back to the old empire of Mali.\n\n==Geographical distribution==\nBambara is spoken throughout Mali as a lingua franca. The language is most widely spoken in the areas east, south, and north of Bamako, where native speakers and/or those that identify as members of the Bambara ethnic group are most densely populated. These regions are also usually considered to be the historical geographical origin of Bambara people, particularly [[S\u00e9gou]], after diverging from other Manding groups.<ref name=\"autogenerated2000\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sil.org/SILESR/2000/2000-003/Manding/Bamana.htm|title=Mand\u00e9 Language Family: Maps of Manding-East, North-Eastern Manding, Bamana, Urban  koine|website=www.sil.org|accessdate=1 January 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130122172907/http://www.sil.org/SILESR/2000/2000-003/Manding/Bamana.htm|archivedate=22 January 2013|df=}}</ref>\n\n==Dialects==\nThe main dialect is Standard Bamara, which has significant influence from Maninkakan.{{clarify|date=August 2015}} Bambara has many local dialects: Kaarta, Tambacounda (west); Beledugu, Bananba, Mesekele (north); Jitumu, Jamaladugu, Segu (center); Cakadugu, Keleyadugu, Jalakadougu, Kurulamini, Banim\u0254nc\u025b, C\u025bmala, C\u025bndugu, Banink\u0254, Sh\u025bndugu, Ganadugu (south); Kala, Kuruma, Saro, dialects to the northeast of Mopti (especially B\u0254r\u025b); Zegedugu, B\u025bndugu, Bak\u0254kan, J\u0254nka (southeast).,<ref name=\"autogenerated2000\"/><ref>Vydrine 1999</ref>\n\n==Writing==\nSince 1967, Bambara has mostly been written in the [[Latin script]], using [[African reference alphabet|some additional phonetic characters]]. The vowels are ''a, e, [[\u025b]]'' (formerly ''[[\u00e8]]''<span style=\"margin-left:3px\">)</span>, ''i, o, [[\u0254]]'' (formerly ''[[\u00f2]]''<span style=\"margin-left:3px\">)</span>, ''u''<span style=\"margin-left:2px\">;</span> accents can be used to indicate tonality. The former digraph ''ny'' is now written ''[[\u0272]]'' when it designates a palatal nasal glide; the ''ny'' spelling is kept for the combination of a nasal vowel with a subsequent oral palatal glide. Following the 1966 Bamako spelling conventions, a nasal velar glide \"[[\u014b]]\" is written as \"[[\u014b]]\", although in early publications it was often transcribed as ''ng'' or ''nk''.\n\nThe [[N'Ko script|N'Ko]] ({{script|Nkoo|\u07d2\u07de\u07cf}}) alphabet is a script devised by [[Solomana Kante]] in 1949 as a writing system for the Manding languages of West Africa; N\u2019Ko means 'I say' in all Manding languages. Kante created N\u2019Ko in response to what he felt were beliefs that Africans were a \"cultureless people\" since prior to this time there had been no indigenous African writing system for his language. N'ko came first into use in Kankan, Guinea as a Maninka alphabet and disseminated from there into other Manding-speaking parts of West Africa. N'ko and the [[Arabic script]] are still in use for Bambara, although the Latin script is much more common.\n<!--\nThere are some or just one?

Although, there are some exceptions:\n* \"W\" is pronounced as in English (e.g. wait), but placed at the end of a word, \"w\" is the plural mark and is pronounced as [u]\n* \"S\" is pronounced most often as in the English word \"see\", but sometimes it can be pronounced as \"sh\" (in phonetic alphabet [\u0283]) as in the word \"shoe\", or again as [z]\n* \"G\" is pronounced most often as in the English word \"go\", but within a word it can be pronounced as in the Spanish word \"abogado\" (in phonetic alphabet [\u0263]), and sometimes at the beginning [gw]<ref>{{Cite book|title=Cours pratique de bambara|last=Bailleul|first=Charles|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=3}}</ref>\n\n==Grammar==\nLike Turkish and Japanese, it is an agglutinative language, meaning that morphemes are glued together to form a word.\n\nThe basic sentence structure is Subject Object Verb.  Take the phrase, \"n t'a don\" (I don't know [it]). \"n\" is the subject (me), \"a\" is the object (it), and \"[ka] don\" is the verb ([to] know). The \"t'\" is from the present tense marker \"t\u00e9.\" \"t\u00e9\" is the negative present tense marker and \"b\u00e9\" is the affirmative present tense marker. Therefore, \"n b'a don\" would mean \"I know it\".\n\nBambara is an [[subject\u2013object\u2013verb|SOV]] language and has two (mid/standard and high) [[tone (tonal language)|tone]]s; e.g. ''sa'' 'die' vs. ''s\u00e1'' 'snake.' The typical argument structure of the language consists of a subject, followed by an aspectival auxiliary, followed by the direct object, and finally a transitive verb.  Naturally, if the verb is intransitive, the direct object is absent.\n\nBambara does not inflect for gender. Gender for a noun can be specified by adding an adjective, ''-c\u025b'' or ''-k\u025b'' for male and ''-muso'' for female. The plural is formed by attaching a vocalic suffix ''-u'', most often with a low tone (in the orthography, ''-w'') to nouns or adjectives.\n\nBambara uses postpositions in much the same manner as languages like English and French use prepositions. These postpositions are found after the verb and are used to express direction, location, and in some cases, possession.\n\n===Loan words===\nIn urban areas, many Bambara conjunctions have been replaced in everyday use by French borrowings that often mark code-switches. The [[Bamako]] dialect makes use of sentences like: ''N taara Kita mais il n'y avait personne l\u00e0-bas.'' : ''I went to Kita [Bambara] but there was no one there [French].'' The sentence in Bambara alone would be ''N taara Kita nka m\u0254g\u0254si tunt\u025b yen.'' The French proposition \"est-ce que\" is also used in Bambara; however, it is pronounced more slowly and as three syllables, {{IPA|[\u025bs\u0259k\u0259]}}.\n\nBambara uses many French loan words. For example, some people might say:\n''I ka kulosi ye jauni ye'': \"Your skirt is yellow\" (using a derivation of the French word for yellow, jaune.)\n\nHowever, one could also say:\n''I ka kulosi ye neremuguman ye'', also meaning \"your skirt is yellow.\" The original Bambara word for yellow comes from \"''neremugu'',\" being flour (''mugu'') made from [[Parkia biglobosa|n\u00e9r\u00e9]] (locust bean), a seed from a long seed pod. Neremugu is often used in sauces in Southern Mali.\n\nMost French loan words are suffixed with the sound 'i'; this is particularly common when using French words which have a meaning not traditionally found in Mali. For example, the Bambara word for [[snow]] is ''niegei'', based on the French word for snow ''neige''. As there has never been snow in Mali, there was no unique word in Bambara to describe it.\n\n===Examples===\n:''N b\u025b bamanankan m\u025bn d\u0254\u0254ni-d\u0254\u0254ni''\n:I understand/hear a little bit of Bambara (lit: I ''aux positive'' Bambara hear small-small)\n\n:''I t\u025bna dumuni ke wa?''\n:Aren't you going to eat? (lit: you ''aux negative future'' eating do ''question particle'')\n\n:''Du Mara be ameriki hali bi wa?''\n:Is Dou Mara still living in the USA? (lit: Dou Mara still America in live ''question particle'')\n\n==Music==\nMalian artists such as [[Oumou Sangar\u00e9]], [[Sidiki Diabat\u00e9]], [[Rokia Traor\u00e9]], [[Ali Farka Tour\u00e9]], [[Salif Keita]], [[Habib Koit\u00e9]], and the married duo [[Amadou & Mariam]] often sing in Bambara.  A\u00efda of the band [[M\u00e9tisse (band)|M\u00e9tisse]] often sings in [[Dyula language|Dioula]], as does [[Mory Kante]], born in Guinea to a Malian mother; his most famous song to date is \"Yeke Yeke\" ([[Alpha Blondy]]).  Lyrics in Bambara occur on [[Stevie Wonder]]'s soundtrack ''[[Journey through the Secret Life of Plants]]''.\n[[Tiken Jah Fakoly]] (reggae) often sings in Dioula and French.\n\nAdditionally, in 2010, [[Spain|Spanish]] rock group [[Dover (band)|Dover]] released its 7th studio album [[I Ka Ken\u00e9]], with the majority of lyrics in the language. American rapper [[Nas]] also released a track titled \"Sabali\" in 2010, which featured [[Damian Marley]]. ''Sabali'' is a Bambara word that means patience.\n\n==Legal status==\nBambara is one of several languages designated by Mali as a [[national language]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Skattum |first=Ingse |date=2010 |title=L'introduction des langues nationales dans le syst\u00e8me \u00e9ducatif au Mali: objectifs et cons\u00e9quences |trans-title=The Introduction of National Languages to the Malian Educational System: Problems and Consequences |url=http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/docserver/19552629/3/1/19552629_003_01_S013_text.pdf?expires=1487354096&id=id&accname=guest&checksum=2A729881414DED33D000C3984B49D9E3 |language=French |journal=Journal of Language Contact |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=248 |doi=10.1163/19552629-90000013 |access-date=February 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Bailleul Ch.

This is also reflected in the city's nickname as the \"[[City of Winds]]\". A less probable [[folk etymology]] explains the name as deriving from ''Baghkuy'', meaning \"God's town\". ''Baga'' (now ''\u0628\u063a'' ''bagh'') and ''kuy'' are the [[Old Persian language|Old Persian]] words for \"god\" and \"town\" respectively; the name ''Baghkuy'' may be compared with ''[[Baghdad|Baghd\u0101d]]'' (\"God-given\") in which ''d\u0101d'' is the Old Persian word for \"give\". [[Arabic language|Arabic]] sources refer to the city as ''Baku'', ''Bakukh'', ''Bakuya'', and ''Bakuye'', all of which seem to come from a Persian name.\n\nDuring [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet rule]], the city was spelled in Cyrillic as \"\u0411\u0430\u043a\u0443\"{{Specify|date=November 2017}}{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} in Russian and \u00ab\u0411\u0430\u043a\u044b\u00bb in Azerbaijani.

Between the 12th and 14th centuries, massive fortifications were undertaken in Baku and the surrounding towns. The [[Maiden Tower (Baku)|Maiden Tower]], the [[Ramana Tower]], the [[Nardaran Fortress]], the Shagan Castle, the [[Quadrangular castle (Mardakan)|Mardakan Castle]], the [[Round Castle (Mardakan)|Round Castle]] and also the famous [[Sabayil Castle]] on the island of the [[Bay of Baku]] was built during this period. The [[Old City (Baku)|city walls of Baku]] were also rebuilt and strengthened.\n\nBy the early 16th century Baku's wealth and strategic position attracted the focus of its larger neighbors; in the previous two centuries, it was under the rule of the in Iran-centred [[Kara Koyunlu]] and [[Ak Koyunlu]]. The fall of the Ak Koyunlu brought the city immediately into the sphere of the newly formed Iranian [[Safavid dynasty]], led by king (''[[shah]]'') [[Ismail I]] (r. 1501\u20131524). Ismail I laid siege to Baku in 1501 and captured it; he allowed the Shirvanshahs to remain in power, under Safavid suzerainty. His successor, king [[Tahmasp I]] (r. 1524\u20131576), completely removed the Shirvanshahs from power, and made Baku a part of the [[Safavid Shirvan|Shirvan]] province. Baku remained as an integral part of his empire and the successive Iranian dynasties to come for the next centuries, until the irrevocable cession in the [[Treaty of Gulistan|first half of the 19th century]]. The House of Shirvan, who ruled Baku since the 9th century, was extinguished in the course of the Safavid rule.\n\nAt this time the city was enclosed within the lines of strong walls, which were washed by the sea on one side and protected by a wide trench on land. The Ottomans briefly gained control over Baku as a result of the [[Ottoman-Safavid War (1578-1590)|Ottoman-Safavid War of 1578\u20131590]]; by 1607, it was again put under Iranian control.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3SapTk5iGDkC&pg=PA65|title=Cities of the Middle East and North Africa|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-57607-919-5|author1=Dumper|first1=Michael|last2=Stanley|first2=Bruce E|year=2007}}</ref> In 1604 Baku fortress was destroyed by Shah [[Abbas I of Persia|Abbas I]] (r. 1588-1629).\n\n[[File:Ateshgah temple inscription.png|upright|thumb|left|[[Ateshgah of Baku|Atashgah]] is a temple built by [[India]]n traders before 1745, west of the Caspian Sea.

On 13 June 1796, a Russian flotilla entered Baku Bay, and a garrison of Russian troops was placed inside the city. Later, however, [[Paul I of Russia|Pavel I]] ordered the cessation of the campaign and the withdrawal of Russian forces following his predecessor, [[Catherine the Great]]'s death. In March 1797, the tsarist troops left Baku and the city became part of [[Qajar Iran]] again.\n\nIn 1813, following the [[Russo-Persian War (1804\u201313)|Russo-Persian War of 1804\u20131813]], Qajar Iran was forced to sign the [[Treaty of Gulistan]] with Russia, which provided for the irrevocable cession of Baku and most of Iran's territories in the [[North Caucasus]] and [[South Caucasus]] to Russia. During the next and final bout of hostilities between the two, the [[Russo-Persian War (1826\u201328)|Russo-Persian War of 1826\u20131828]], Baku was briefly recaptured by the Iranians.

It was mechanically drilled, though a number of hand-dug wells predate it. Large-scale oil exploration started in 1872 when Russian imperial authorities auctioned the parcels of oil-rich land around Baku to private investors. The pioneer of oil extracting from the bottom of the sea was Polish geologist Witold Zglenicki.<ref>[[Witold Zglenicki]]</ref> Soon after that Swiss, British, French, Belgian, German, Swedish and American investors appeared in Baku. Among them were the firms of the [[Robert Nobel|Nobel brothers]] together with the family [[Schuch|von B\u00f6rtzell-Szuch]] (Carl Knut B\u00f6rtzell, who also owned the [[Livadia Palace]]) and the [[Rothschild family]]. An industrial oil belt, better known as Black City, was established near Baku.\n\nProfessor [[A. V. Williams Jackson]] of Columbia University wrote in his work ''From Constantinople to the Home of Omar Khayyam'' (1911):\n{{quotation|Baku is a city founded upon oil, for to its inexhaustible founts of naphtha it owes its very existence, its maintenance, its prosperity... At present Baku produces one-fifth of the oil that is used in the world, and the immense output in crude petroleum from this single city far surpasses that in any other district where oil is found.

During the infamous [[March Days]], Bolsheviks and [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation|Dashnaks]] seeking to establish control over Baku streets, were faced with armed Azerbaijani groups.

Shortly after this Baku was proclaimed the new capital of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic.\n\nWith Turkey having lost the war by October 1918 they conducted the [[Armistice of Mudros]] with the British which meant Baku was to be evacuated. Headed by General [[William Montgomery Thomson|William Thomson]], British troops of 5,000 soldiers, including parts of Dunsterforce, arrived in Baku on 17 November. Thomson declared himself military governor of Baku and implemented [[Martial law]] on the capital until \"the civil power would be strong enough to release the forces from the responsibility to maintain the public order\".

On 28 April 1920, the [[11th Army (RSFSR)|11th Red Army]] invaded Baku and reinstalled the Bolsheviks, making Baku the capital of the [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic]].\n\nThe city underwent many major changes. As a result, Baku played a great role in many branches of the Soviet life. Since about 1921, the city was headed by Baku City Executive Committee, commonly known in Russian as ''Bakgorispolkom''. Together with Baku Party Committee (known as the ''Baksovet''), it developed the economic significance of the Caspian metropolis. From 1922 to 1930, Baku was the venue for one of the major [[Trade fair]]s of the Soviet Union, serving as a commercial bridgehead to Iran and the Middle East.<ref>Etienne Forestier-Peyrat, \u2033[http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/ab_imperio/summary/v2013/2013.4.forestier-peyrat.html Red Passage to Iran: Baku Trade Fair and the Unmaking of the Azerbaijani Borderland, 1922\u20131930]\u2033, ''Ab Imperio'', Vol 2013, Issue 4, pp. 79\u2013112.</ref>\n\n=== World War II ===\nBaku's growing importance as a major energy hub remained in sight of the major powers. During [[World War II]] and the [[Case Blue|Nazi German invasion of the southwestern Soviet Union]], Baku had become of vital strategic importance. In fact, capturing the [[Petroleum industry in Azerbaijan#World War II|oil fields of Baku]] was one of the ultimate goals of [[Operation Edelweiss]], carried out between May and November 1942. However, the German Army's closest approach to Baku was no closer than some {{convert|530|km|0|abbr=off}} northwest of Baku in November 1942, falling far short of the city's capture before being driven back during the Soviet [[Operation Little Saturn]] in mid-December 1942.\n\n=== Fall of the Soviet Union and later ===\nAfter the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], Baku embarked on a process of restructuring on a scale unseen in its history.<ref>{{cite web|title=Money from oil changes the face of Azerbaijan|url=http://news.az/articles/society/41029|publisher=news.az|accessdate=22 July 2011}}</ref> Thousands of buildings from the Soviet period were demolished to make way for a green belt on its shores; parks and gardens were built on the land reclaimed by filling up the beaches of the [[Baku Bay]].

In the vicinity of the city there are a number of [[mud volcano]]es (Keyraki, Bogkh-bogkha, [[Lokbatan]] and others) and [[salt lake]]s ([[Lake Boyukshor|Boyukshor]], Khodasan and so on).\n\n=== Climate ===\nBaku has a [[temperate]] [[semi-arid climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]: ''BSk'') with hot and humid summers, cool and occasionally wet winters, and strong winds all year long. However, unlike many other cities with such climate features, Baku does not see extremely hot summers. This is largely because of its northerly [[latitude]] and the fact that it is located on a peninsula on the shore of the Caspian Sea. Baku and the [[Absheron Peninsula]] on which it is situated, is the most arid part of Azerbaijan ([[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] here is around or less than {{convert|200|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} a year). The majority of the light annual precipitation occurs in seasons other than summer, but none of these seasons are particularly wet.\nDuring Soviet times, Baku with its long hours of sunshine and dry healthy climate, was a vacation destination where citizens could enjoy beaches or relax in now-dilapidated [[destination spa|spa]] complexes overlooking the Caspian Sea.

There are a number of ancient hamams in Baku dating back to the 12th, 14th and 18th centuries. Hamams play a very important role in the architectural appearance of Baku.<ref>https://www.azernews.az/travel/62986.html</ref>\n\n==== Teze Bey Hamam ====\nTeze Bey is the most popular hamam (traditional bath) in Baku. It was built in 1886 in the center of Baku and in 2003 it was fully restored and modernized. Along with its modern amenities, Teze Bey features a swimming pool and architectural details inspired by Oriental, Russian and Finnish baths.\n\n==== Gum Hamam ====\nGum Hamam was discovered during archaeological excavations underneath the sand; hence the name: Gum hamam (sand bath). It was built sometime during the 12th\u201314th centuries.\n\n==== Bairamali hamam ====\nIn ancient times Bairamali Hamam was called \u201cBey Hamam\u201d. The original structure was built sometime during the 12th\u201314th centuries and was reconstructed in 1881.\n\n==== Agha Mikayil Hamam ====\nAgha Mikayil Hamam was constructed in the 18th century by Haji Agha Mikayil on Kichik Gala Street in the Old City (icherisheher). It is still operating in its ancient setting. The Hamam is open to women on Mondays and Fridays and to men on the other days of the week.\n\n=== Modern Architecture ===\n \nLate modern and postmodern architecture began to appear in the early 2000s. With economic development, old buildings such as Atlant House were razed to make way for new ones. Buildings with all-glass shells have appeared around the city, the most prominent examples being the [[Azerbaijan Tower]], [[Heydar Aliyev Center|Heydar Aliyev Cultural Center]], [[Flame Towers]], [[Baku Crystal Hall]], [[Baku White City]] and [[SOCAR Tower]]. These projects also caught the attention of international media as notable programmes such as [[Discovery Channel]]'s [[Extreme Engineering]] did pieces focusing in on changes to the city.<ref>{{cite web|title=Heydar Aliyev Cultural Center And Flame Towers|url=http://science.discovery.com/tv/build-bigger/projects/azerbaijan/heydar-aliyev-cultural-center.html|publisher=Discovery Communications|accessdate=25 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe Old City of Baku, also known as the Walled City of Baku, refers to the ancient Baku settlement. Most of the walls and towers, strengthened after the Russian conquest in 1806, survived.

[[Baku State University]], the first established university in Azerbaijan was opened in 1919 by the government of the [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]]. In the early years of the Soviet era, Baku already had [[Azerbaijan State Oil Academy]], [[Azerbaijan Medical University]] and [[Azerbaijan State Economic University]]. In the post-WWII period, a few more universities were established such as [[Azerbaijan Technical University]], [[Azerbaijan University of Languages]] and the [[Azerbaijan Architecture and Construction University]]. After 1991 when Azerbaijan gained independence from the Soviet Union, the fall of communism led to the development of a number of private institutions, including [[Qafqaz University]] and [[Khazar University]] which are currently considered the most prestigious academic institutions. Apart from the private universities, the government established the [[Academy of Public Administration (Azerbaijan)|Academy of Public Administration]], the [[Azerbaijan Diplomatic Academy]] and various military academies. The largest universities according to the student population are Baku State University and Azerbaijan State Economic University.

Publicly run kindergartens and elementary schools (years 1 through 11) are operated by local wards or municipal offices.\n\nThe [[Azerbaijan National Academy of Sciences]], the main state research organization in Azerbaijan is locating in Baku as well.

instrument]] with a characteristic triangular wooden, hollow body and three strings. Two strings are usually tuned to the same note and the third string is a [[perfect fourth]] higher. The higher-pitched balalaikas are used to play melodies and chords.The instrument generally has a short [[sustain]], necessitating rapid strumming or plucking when it is used to play melodies. Balalaikas are often used for Russian folk music and dancing.\n\nThe balalaika ''family of instruments'' includes instruments of various sizes, from the highest-pitched to the lowest: the piccolo balalaika, prima balalaika, secunda balalaika, alto balalaika, bass balalaika, and contrabass balalaika. There are balalaika orchestras which consist solely of different balalaikas; these ensembles typically play Classical music that has been arranged for balalaikas. The prima balalaika is the most common; the piccolo is rare. There have also been ''descant'' and ''tenor'' balalaikas, but these are considered obsolete. All have three-sided bodies; spruce, evergreen, or fir tops; and backs made of three to nine wooden sections (usually maple). They are typically strung with three strings, and the necks are fretted.\n\nThe prima balalaika, secunda and alto are played either with the fingers or a [[plectrum]] (pick), depending on the music being played, and the bass and contrabass (equipped with extension legs that rest on the floor) are played with leather plectra. The rare piccolo instrument is usually played with a pick.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.balalaika.org/_instruments.htm |title=The Washington Balalaika Society |publisher=www.balalaika.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301144711/http://www.balalaika.org/_instruments.htm |archivedate=1 March 2009 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe earliest mention of the term ''balalaika'' dates back to a 1688 Russian document.<ref>Belinskiy, Dmitry.

Sometimes the balalaika is tuned \"guitar style\" by folk musicians to G<sub>3</sub>\u2013B<sub>3</sub>\u2013D<sub>4</sub> (mimicking the three highest strings of the [[Russian guitar]]), whereby it is easier to play for Russian guitar players, although classically trained balalaika purists avoid this tuning. It can also be tuned to E<sub>4</sub>\u2013A<sub>4</sub>\u2013D<sub>5</sub>, like its cousin, the [[domra]], to make it easier for those trained on the domra to play the instrument, and still have a balalaika sound.<ref>[http://www.get-tuned.com/balalaika.php How to tune a Balalaika]</ref>  The folk (pre-Andreev) tuning D<sub>4</sub>\u2013F{{music|sharp}}<sub>4</sub>\u2013A<sub>4</sub> was very popular, as this makes it easier to play certain [[riff]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://balalaikafr.free.fr/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=18&Itemid=61&lang=us|title=Balalaika.fr \u2013 Origins of balalaika|author=Micha Tcherkassky}}</ref>\n\nThe balalaika has been made the following sizes:<ref>Ekkel, Bibs; ''The Complete Balalaika Book''; Mel Bay Publications; Pacific, Missouri:  1997.  pg. 90\u201392.  {{ISBN|0-7866-2475-2}}</ref>\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

These have three double courses similar to the stringing of the [[mandolin]] and often use a \"guitar\" tuning.<ref>[http://www.mandolinluthier.com/balalaika_page.htm| \nWhat is a balalaika?]</ref> \n\nFour string alto balalaikas are also encountered and are used in the orchestra of the [[Piatnistky Folk Choir]].\n\nThe piccolo, prima, d secunda balalaikas were originally strung with gut with the thinnest melody string made of stainless steel. Today, nylon strings are commonly used in place of gut.<ref>[http://www.balalajka.com/info.html Basic Information]</ref>\n\nAmateur and/or souvenir-style prima balalaikas usually have a total of 16 frets, while in professional orchesta-like ones that number raises to 24.<ref>Ibid.</ref>\n\n=== Technique ===\n\nAn important part of balalaika technique is the use of the left thumb to fret notes on the lower string, particularly on the prima, where it is used to form [[chord (music)|chords]]. Traditionally, the side of the [[index finger]] of the right hand is used to sound notes on the prima, while a [[plectrum]] is used on the larger sizes.\n\nBecause of the large size of the contrabass's strings, it is not uncommon to see players using plectra made from a leather shoe or boot [[heel (shoe)|heel]]. The bass balalaika and contrabass balalaika rest on the ground, on a wooden or metal pin that is drilled into one of its corners.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Stamp-russia2014-musical-instruments-block.png|thumb|300px|right|Balalaika Postal stamps.]]\n=== Possible origins ===\n\nThe exact origins of the balalaika are unknown.\n\nHowever, it is commonly agreed that it descended from the [[domra]], an instrument from the [[Caucasus region]] of Russia. There is also similarity to the Kazakh [[dombra]], which has 2 strings, and the Mongolian [[topshur]].<ref>\nFindeizen, Nikolai. ''History of Music in Russia from Antiquity to 1800.'' Ed. Milo\u0161 Velimirovi\u0107\n and Claudia Jensen. Vol. 1. Bloomington, IN: Indiana UP, 2008. P. 172.</ref>\n\n=== The pre-Andreyev period ===\nEarly representations of the balalaika show it with anywhere from two to six strings, which resembles certain Central Asian instruments. Similarly, [[fret]]s on earlier balalaikas were made of animal gut and tied to the neck so that they could be moved around by the player at will (as is the case with the modern [[baglama|saz]], which allows for the playing distinctive to Turkish and Central Asian music).\n\nThe first known document mentioning the instrument dates back to 1688. A guard's logbook from the [[Moscow Kremlin]] records that two [[commoners]] were stopped from playing the Balalika whilst drunk.<ref>{{cite news|title=Balalaika orchestra offers glimpse of instruments, music|url=http://www.dailyprogress.com/entertainment/article_3bd28b46-7c32-5f5d-aa33-fd7d73a5a781.html|accessdate=18 December 2012|newspaper=The Daily Progress|date=28 September 2012}}</ref> Further documents from 1700 and 1714 also mention the instrument.

Ivanov. The instrument began to be used in his concert performances. A few years later, St. Petersburg craftsman Paserbsky further refined the instruments by adding a fully chromatic set of frets and also a number of balalaikas in orchestral sizes with the tunings now found in modern instruments. Andreyev patented the design and arranged numerous traditional Russian folk melodies for the orchestra. He also composed a body of concert pieces for the instrument.<ref>\u041f\u0440\u043e\u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432, \u0410. \u041c., ed.

Ed. James R. Millar.\n Vol. 2. New York: Macmillan Reference USA, 2004. p. 510.</ref>  The balalaika orchestra in its full form consists of balalaikas, [[domra]]s, [[gusli]], [[bayan (music)|bayan]], [[Vladimir Shepherd's Horns]], [[garmoshka]]s and several types of percussion instruments.\n\nWith the establishment of the Soviet system and the entrenchment of a proletarian cultural direction, the culture of the working classes (which included that of village labourers) was actively supported by the Soviet establishment. The concept of the balalaika orchestra was adopted wholeheartedly by the Soviet government as something distinctively proletarian (that is, from the working classes) and was also deemed progressive. Significant amounts of energy and time were devoted to support and foster formal study of the balalaika, from which highly skilled ensemble groups such as the [[Osipov State Russian Folk Orchestra]] emerged. Balalaika virtuosi such as [[Boris Feoktistov]] and [[Pavel Necheporenko]] became stars both inside and outside the Soviet Union.

The top four and the bottom 19 storeys are used by the Bank, while the other floors are leased out.<!--from Chinese article --> Ownership has since been transferred to BOCHK, although the Bank of China has leased back several floors for use by its own operations in Hong Kong.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}\n\n===Favouritism controversy===\nThe Government had apparently given preferential treatment to Chinese companies, and was again criticised for the apparent preferential treatment to the BOCHK.<ref name=\"dearfriends\" />\n\nThe price paid was half the amount of the 6,250 m\u00b2 Admiralty II plot, for which the [[MTR Corporation]] paid HK$1.82 billion in cash. The BOC would make initial payment of $60 million, with the rest payable over 13 years at 6% interest. The announcement of the sale was also poorly handled, and a dive in business confidence ensued. The [[Hang Seng Index]] fell 80 points, and the [[Hong Kong dollar|HK$]] lost 1.5% of its value the next day.<ref name=\"dearfriends\" />\n\n=== Construction ===\n[[File:HK-architecture-BOCHK-Bank-of-China-Building-under-construction-1988-00.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The Bank of China Building under construction in 1988]]\nThe tower was built by Japanese contractor [[Kumagai Gumi]].

A press conference scheduled for 24 May 1989, two weeks before the massacre, was intended to show off the building's \"designer socialist furnishings\", but was called off as the student demonstrations in [[Beijing]] escalated.

However, owing to project delays, groundbreaking took place in March 1985, almost two years late. It was topped out in 1989, and occupied on 15 June 1990.<!--from Chinese article -->\n\n== Design ==\n[[File:Bank of China Tower massing model.svg|thumb|right|[[Massing]] model showing the shape of the Bank of China Tower. The labels correspond to the number of 'X' shapes on each outward facing side.]]\nDesigned by [[Pritzker Prize]]-winning architect [[I. M. Pei]], the building is {{convert|315.0|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} high with two masts reaching {{convert|367.4|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} high. The 72-storey building is located near [[Central (MTR)|Central MTR station]]. This was the tallest building in Hong Kong and Asia from 1990 to 1992, the first building outside the United States to break the 305 m (1,000&nbsp;ft) mark, and the first composite [[space frame]] high-rise building. That also means it was the tallest outside the United States from its completion year, 1990. It is now the fourth tallest skyscraper in Hong Kong, after [[International Commerce Centre]], [[Two International Finance Centre]] and [[Central Plaza (Hong Kong)|Central Plaza]].\n\nA small observation deck on the 43rd floor of the building is open to the public.\n\nThe [[structural expressionism]] adopted in the design of this building resembles growing bamboo shoots, symbolising livelihood and prosperity. The whole structure is supported by the four steel columns at the corners of the building, with the triangular frameworks transferring the weight of the structure onto these four columns. It is covered with glass curtain walls.\n\nWhile its distinctive look makes it one of Hong Kong's most identifiable landmarks today, it was the source of some controversy at one time, as the bank is the only major building in Hong Kong to have bypassed the convention of consulting with [[feng shui]] masters on matters of design prior to construction.\n\nThe building has been criticised by some practitioners of feng shui for its sharp edges and its negative symbolism by the numerous 'X' shapes in its original design, though Pei modified the design to some degree before construction following this feedback. The building's profile from some angles resembles that of a [[Cleaver (knife)|meat cleaver]] and it is sometimes referred to as a \"vertical knife\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/style/article/100-years-of-i-m-pei-bank-of-china/index.html|title=How I.M.

By 1900, the family was farming southeast of [[Streetman, Texas]]. Jefferson's birth date was recorded as September 1893 in the [[1900 census]].<ref>1900 US Census.

He became a [[busking|street musician]], playing in [[East Texas]] towns in front of barbershops and on street corners.<ref name=\"dicaire\"/> According to his cousin Alec Jefferson, quoted in the notes for ''Blind Lemon Jefferson, Classic Sides'':\n\n{{quote|They were rough. Men were [[prostitution|hustling women]] and selling [[bootleg liquor|bootleg]] and Lemon was singing for them all night... he'd start singing about eight and go on until four in the morning... mostly it would be just him sitting there and playing and singing all night.}}\n\nIn the early 1910s, Jefferson began traveling frequently to Dallas, where he met and played with the blues musician [[Lead Belly]].<ref name=\"dicaire\"/> Jefferson was one of the earliest and most prominent figures in the blues movement developing in the [[Deep Ellum]] section of Dallas. It is likely that he moved to Deep Ellum on a more permanent basis by 1917, where he met Aaron Thibeaux Walker, also known as [[T-Bone Walker]]. Jefferson taught Walker the basics of playing blues guitar in exchange for Walker's occasional services as a guide. By the early 1920s, Jefferson was earning enough money for his musical performances to support a wife and, possibly, a child.<ref name=\"dicaire\"/> However, firm evidence of his marriage and children has not been found.\n\n===Beginning of recording career===\nPrior to Jefferson, few artists had recorded solo voice and blues guitar, the first of which were the vocalist [[Sara Martin]] and the guitarist Sylvester Weaver, who recorded \"Longing for Daddy Blues\", probably on October 24, 1923.<ref>Gibbs, Craig Martin (2012). ''Black Recording Artists, 1877\u20131926: An Annotated Discography''.

Uncharacteristically, his first two recordings from this session were [[Gospel music|gospel]] songs (\"[[Lord, I Want to Be a Christian|I Want to Be Like Jesus in My Heart]]\" and \"All I Want Is That Pure Religion\"), released under the name '''Deacon L. J. Bates'''.

Their popularity led to the release of the other two songs from that session, \"Got the Blues\" and \"Long Lonesome Blues\", which became a runaway success, with sales in six figures. He recorded about 100 tracks between 1926 and 1929; 43 [[gramophone record|records]] were issued, all but one for [[Paramount Records]]. Paramount's studio techniques and quality were poor, and the recordings were released with poor sound quality. In May 1926, Paramount re-recorded Jefferson performing his hits \"Got the Blues\" and \"Long Lonesome Blues\" in the superior facilities at [[Autograph Records|Marsh Laboratories]], and subsequent releases used those versions. Both versions appear on compilation albums.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n===Success with Paramount Records===\n[[File:ParamountLabelBLJefferson.jpg|thumb|Label of one of Jefferson's Paramount records, 1926]]\nLargely because of the popularity of artists such as Jefferson and his contemporaries [[Blind Blake]] and [[Ma Rainey]], Paramount became the leading recording company for the blues in the 1920s.<ref>Dixon, R. M. W.; Godrich, J. (1970). \"Recording the Blues\". Reprinted in Oliver, Paul; Russell, Tony; Dixon, Robert M. W.; Godrich, John; Rye, Howard (2001). ''Yonder Come the Blues''. Cambridge. p. 288. {{ISBN|0-521-78777-7}}.</ref> Jefferson's earnings reputedly enabled him to buy a car and employ chauffeurs (this information has been disputed); he was given a Ford car \"worth over $700\" by [[Mayo Williams]], Paramount's connection with the black community. This was a common compensation for recording rights in that market. Jefferson is known to have done an unusual amount of traveling for the time in the American South, which is reflected in the difficulty of placing his music in a single regional category.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nJefferson's \"old-fashioned\" sound and confident musicianship made it easy to market him. His skillful guitar playing and impressive vocal range opened the door for a new generation of male solo blues performers, such as [[Furry Lewis]], [[Charlie Patton]], and [[Barbecue Bob]].<ref name=\"Evans 2000 83\u2013116\"/> He stuck to no musical conventions, varying his [[riff]]s and rhythm and singing complex and expressive lyrics in a manner exceptional at the time for a \"simple country blues singer.\" According to the North Carolina musician Walter Davis, Jefferson played on the streets in [[Johnson City, Tennessee]], during the early 1920s, at which time Davis and the entertainer Clarence Greene learned the art of blues guitar.<ref>Erbsen, Wayne (1981). \"Walter Davis: Fist and Skull Banjo\". ''Bluegrass Unlimited'', March 1981. pp. 22\u201326.</ref>\n\nJefferson was reputedly unhappy with his royalties (although Williams said that Jefferson had a bank account containing as much as $1500). In 1927, when Williams moved to [[Okeh Records]], he took Jefferson with him, and Okeh quickly recorded and released Jefferson's \"Matchbox Blues\", backed with \"[[That Black Snake Moan|Black Snake Moan]]\".<ref name=\"Russell\"/> It was his only Okeh recording, probably because of contractual obligations with Paramount. Jefferson's two songs released on Okeh have considerably better sound quality than his Paramount records at the time. When he returned to Paramount a few months later, \"Matchbox Blues\" had already become such a hit that Paramount re-recorded and released two new versions, with the producer [[Arthur Laibly]]. In 1927, Jefferson recorded another of his classic songs, the haunting \"[[See That My Grave Is Kept Clean]]\" (again using the pseudonym Deacon L. J. Bates), and two other uncharacteristically spiritual songs, \"He Arose from the Dead\" and \"Where Shall I Be\". \"See That My Grave Is Kept Clean\" was so successful that it was re-recorded and re-released in 1928.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n===Death and grave===\nJefferson died in Chicago at 10:00&nbsp;a.m. on December 19, 1929, of what his death certificate said was \"probably acute [[myocarditis]]\".<ref>{{cite book |title=The Frog Blues & Jazz Annual No. 1: The Musicians, the Records & the Music of the 78 Era |year=2010 |publisher=[[Frog Records]] |isbn=0956471706}}</ref> For many years, rumors circulated that a jealous lover had poisoned his coffee, but a more likely explanation is that he died of a heart attack after becoming disoriented during a snowstorm. Some have said that he died of a heart attack after being attacked by a dog in the middle of the night. In his 1983 book ''Tolbert's Texas'', [[Frank X. Tolbert]] claims that he was killed while being robbed of a large royalty payment by a guide escorting him to [[Chicago Union Station]] to catch a train home to Texas. Paramount Records paid for the return of his body to Texas by train, accompanied by the pianist [[William Ezell]].{{cn|date=September 2018}}\n\nJefferson was buried at [[Wortham, Texas|Wortham]] Negro Cemetery (later Wortham Black Cemetery). His grave was unmarked until 1967, when a Texas historical marker was erected in the general area of his plot, however the precise location of the grave is unknown. By 1996, the cemetery and marker were in poor condition, and a new granite headstone was erected in 1997. The inscription reads: \"Lord, it's one kind favour I'll ask of you, see that my grave is kept clean.\" In 2007 the cemetery's name was changed to Blind Lemon Memorial Cemetery, and his gravesite is kept clean by a cemetery committee in Wortham.<ref>[http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fje01 \"Jefferson, Blind Lemon\"].

A child having a nightmare in Japan will wake up and repeat three times, \"Baku-san, come eat my dream.\" Legends say that the baku will come into the child's room and devour the bad dream, allowing the child to go back to sleep peacefully. However, calling to the baku must be done sparingly, because if he remains hungry after eating one's nightmare, he may also devour their hopes and desires as well, leaving them to live an empty life. The baku can also be summoned for protection from bad dreams prior to falling asleep at night. In the 1910s, it was common for Japanese children to keep a baku talisman at their bedside.<ref>M.Reese:\"The Asian traditions and myths\".pg.60</ref><ref>Hadland Davis F., \"Myths and Legends of Japan\" (London: [[G.

Little is known about his early life, but he may have been a sailor on [[privateer]] ships during [[Queen Anne's War]] before settling on the [[The Bahamas|Bahamian]] island of [[New Providence]], a base for Captain [[Benjamin Hornigold]], whose crew Teach joined around 1716. Hornigold placed him in command of a [[sloop]] that he had captured, and the two engaged in numerous acts of piracy. Their numbers were boosted by the addition to their fleet of two more ships, one of which was commanded by [[Stede Bonnet]]; but Hornigold retired from piracy towards the end of 1717, taking two vessels with him.\n\nTeach captured a French merchant vessel, renamed her ''[[Queen Anne's Revenge]]'', and equipped her with 40 guns. He became a renowned pirate, his nickname derived from his thick black beard and fearsome appearance; he was reported to have tied lit fuses ([[slow match]]es) under his hat to frighten his enemies.  He formed an alliance of pirates and blockaded the port of [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charles Town, South Carolina]], ransoming the port's inhabitants. He then ran ''Queen Anne's Revenge'' aground on a sandbar near [[Beaufort, North Carolina]].  He parted company with Bonnet and settled in [[Bath, North Carolina]], also known as Bath Town where he accepted a royal pardon.  But he was soon back at sea, where he attracted the attention of [[Alexander Spotswood]], the [[Governor of Virginia]].  Spotswood arranged for a party of soldiers and sailors to capture the pirate, which they did on 22&nbsp;November 1718 following a ferocious battle. Teach and several of his crew were killed by a small force of sailors led by Lieutenant [[Robert Maynard]].\n\nTeach was a shrewd and calculating leader who spurned the use of force, relying instead on his fearsome image to elicit the response that he desired from those whom he robbed.  Contrary to the modern-day picture of the traditional tyrannical pirate, he commanded his vessels with the consent of their crews and there is no known account of his ever having harmed or murdered those whom he held captive. He was romanticized after his death and became the inspiration for an archetypal pirate in works of fiction across many genres.\n\n==Early life==\nLittle is known about Blackbeard's early life.  It is commonly believed that at the time of his death he was between 35&nbsp;and&nbsp;40 years old and thus born in about 1680.<ref>{{Harvnb|Perry|2006|p=14}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Konstam|2007|pp=10\u201312}}</ref>  In contemporary records his name is most often given as Blackbeard, Edward Thatch or Edward Teach; the latter is most often used.  Several spellings of his surname exist\u2014Thatch, Thach, Thache, Thack, Tack, Thatche and Theach.  One early source claims that his surname was Drummond, but the lack of any supporting documentation makes this unlikely.  Pirates habitually used fictitious surnames while engaged in piracy, so as not to tarnish the family name, and this makes it unlikely that Teach's real name will ever be known.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|pp=3\u20134}}</ref><ref name=\"ONDB-Blackbeard\">{{Citation|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/27097|title=Teach, Edward (Blackbeard) (d. 1718) |last=Wood|first=Peter H|year=2004|work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=9 June 2009 |subscription=yes}}</ref>\n\nThe 17th-century rise of Britain's American colonies and the rapid 18th-century expansion of the [[Atlantic slave trade]] had made Bristol an important international sea port, and Teach was most likely raised in what was then the second-largest city in England. He could almost certainly read and write; he communicated with merchants and when killed had in his possession a letter addressed to him by the Chief Justice and Secretary of the [[Province of Carolina]], Tobias Knight. The author Robert Lee speculated that Teach may therefore have been born into a respectable, wealthy family.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|pp=4\u20135}}</ref>  He may have arrived in the Caribbean in the last years of the 17th century, on a merchant vessel (possibly a [[slave ship]]).<ref>{{Harvnb|Konstam|2007|p=19}}</ref>  The 18th-century author [[Captain Charles Johnson|Charles Johnson]] claimed that Teach was for some time a sailor operating from [[Jamaica]] on privateer ships during the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], and that \"he had often distinguished himself for his uncommon boldness and personal courage\".<ref name=\"Johnson 1724 70\">{{Harvnb|Johnson|1724|p=70}}</ref>  At what point during the war Teach joined the fighting is, in keeping with the record of most of his life before he became a pirate, unknown.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|p=9}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Edward Teach (Black Beard), Walking the Plank, from the Pirates of the Spanish Main series (N19) for Allen & Ginter Cigarettes MET DP835032.jpg|thumb|left|Edward Teach (Black Beard), Walking the Plank, from the Pirates of the Spanish Main series (N19) for Allen & Ginter Cigarettes MET DP835032]]\n\n==New Providence==\nWith its history of colonialism, trade and piracy, the West Indies was the setting for many 17th and 18th-century maritime incidents.  The privateer-turned-pirate [[Henry Jennings]] and his followers decided, early in the 18th century, to use the uninhabited island of [[New Providence]] as a base for their operations; it was within easy reach of the [[Florida Strait]] and its busy shipping lanes, which were filled with European vessels crossing the Atlantic.  New Providence's harbour could easily accommodate hundreds of ships but was too shallow for the [[Royal Navy]]'s larger vessels to navigate.  The author George Woodbury described New Providence as \"no city of homes; it was a place of temporary sojourn and refreshment for a literally floating population,\" continuing, \"The only permanent residents were the piratical camp followers, the traders, and the hangers-on; all others were transient.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Woodbury|1951|pp=71\u201372}}</ref> In New Providence, pirates found a welcome respite from the law.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|pp=9\u201311}}</ref>\n\nTeach was one of those who came to enjoy the island's benefits. Probably shortly after the signing of the [[Treaty of Utrecht]], he moved there from Jamaica, and, along with most privateers once involved in the war, became involved in piracy. Possibly about 1716, he joined the crew of Captain [[Benjamin Hornigold]], a renowned pirate who operated from New Providence's safe waters. In 1716 Hornigold placed Teach in charge of a [[sloop]] he had taken as a prize.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|pp=11\u201312}}</ref> In early 1717, Hornigold and Teach, each captaining a sloop, set out for the mainland.  They captured a boat carrying 120&nbsp;barrels of flour out of [[Havana]], and shortly thereafter took 100&nbsp;barrels of wine from a sloop out of [[Bermuda]].  A few days later they stopped a vessel sailing from [[Madeira]] to Charles Town, South Carolina. Teach and his quartermaster, William Howard,{{refn|Benjamin Hornigold may at this time have already parted company with Teach and his two vessels. If this was the case, William Howard would have been left in command of Teach's other sloop.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}|group=\"nb\"}} may at this time have struggled to control their crews. By then they had probably developed a taste for [[Madeira wine]], and on 29&nbsp;September near [[Cape Charles, Virginia|Cape Charles]] all they took from the ''Betty'' of Virginia was her cargo of Madeira, before they [[scuttling|scuttled]] her with the remaining cargo.<ref>{{Harvnb|Konstam|2007|pp=68\u201369}}</ref>\n\nIt was during this cruise with Hornigold that the earliest known report of Teach was made, in which he is recorded as a pirate in his own right, in command of a large crew. In a report made by a Captain Mathew Munthe on an anti-piracy patrol for North Carolina, \"Thatch\" was described as operating \"a sloop 6 gunns {{sic}} and about 70 men\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Konstam|2007|p=64}}</ref> In September Teach and Hornigold encountered Stede Bonnet, a landowner and military officer from a wealthy family who had turned to piracy earlier that year. Bonnet's crew of about 70&nbsp;were reportedly dissatisfied with his command, so with Bonnet's permission, Teach took control of his ship ''Revenge''. The pirates' flotilla now consisted of three ships; Teach on ''Revenge'', Teach's old sloop and Hornigold's ''Ranger''. By October, another vessel had been captured and added to the small fleet.<ref>{{Harvnb|Konstam|2007|pp=78\u201379}}</ref> The sloops ''Robert'' of [[Philadelphia]] and ''Good Intent'' of [[Dublin]] were stopped on 22&nbsp;October 1717, and their cargo holds emptied.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|pp=13\u201314}}</ref>\n\nAs a former British privateer, Hornigold attacked only his old enemies, but for his crew, the sight of British vessels filled with valuable cargo passing by unharmed became too much, and at some point toward the end of 1717 he was demoted. Whether Teach had any involvement in this decision is unknown,<ref>{{Harvnb|Konstam|2007|pp=66\u201367}}</ref> but Hornigold quickly retired from piracy. He took ''Ranger'' and one of the sloops, leaving Teach with ''Revenge'' and the remaining sloop.<ref>{{Harvnb|Konstam|2007|p=79}}</ref> The two never met again, and with many other occupants of New Providence, Hornigold accepted the King's pardon from [[Woodes Rogers]] in June the following year.<ref>{{Harvnb|Woodbury|1951|p=155}}</ref>\n\n===Blackbeard===\n[[File:Blackbeard the Pirate.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Blackbeard, as pictured by [[Benjamin Cole (instrument maker)|Benjamin Cole]] in the second edition of Charles Johnson's ''General Historie''<ref name=\"Johnson 1724 70\"/>]]\nOn 28&nbsp;November Teach's two ships attacked a French merchant vessel off the coast of [[Saint Vincent (island)|Saint Vincent]]. They each fired a [[broadside]] across its bulwarks, killing several of its crew, and forcing its captain to surrender.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|p=14}}</ref> The ship was ''La Concorde'' of [[Saint-Malo]], a large French [[guineaman]] carrying a cargo of slaves. Teach and his crews sailed the vessel south along [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]] to [[Bequia]], where they disembarked her crew and cargo, and converted the ship for their own use. The crew of ''La Concorde'' were given the smaller of Teach's two sloops, which they renamed ''Mauvaise Rencontre'' (Bad Meeting), and sailed for Martinique. Teach may have recruited some of their slaves, but the remainder were left on the island and were later recaptured by the returning crew of ''Mauvaise Rencontre''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Konstam|2007|pp=81\u201388}}</ref>\n\nTeach immediately renamed ''La Concorde'' as ''Queen Anne's Revenge'' and equipped her with 40&nbsp;guns.

After a lengthy engagement, he forced the large and well-armed merchant ship to surrender. He ordered her to move closer to the shore, disembarked her crew and emptied her cargo holds, and then burned and sank the vessel. The incident was chronicled in the ''Boston News-Letter'', which called Teach the commander of a \"French ship of 32&nbsp;Guns, a [[Brigantine|Briganteen]] of 10&nbsp;guns and a Sloop of 12&nbsp;guns.\" When or where Teach collected the ten gun briganteen is unknown, but by that time he may have been in command of at least 150&nbsp;men split among three vessels.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|p=18}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Konstam|2007|p=88}}</ref>\n\nOn 5&nbsp;December 1717 Teach stopped the merchant sloop ''Margaret'' off the coast of Crab Island, near [[Anguilla]]. Her captain, Henry Bostock, and crew, remained Teach's prisoners for about eight hours, and were forced to watch as their sloop was ransacked. Bostock, who had been held aboard ''Queen Anne's Revenge'', was returned unharmed to ''Margaret'' and was allowed to leave with his crew.<ref>{{Harvnb|Konstam|2007|pp=154\u2013155}}</ref> He returned to his base of operations on [[Saint Christopher Island]] and reported the matter to Governor Walter Hamilton, who requested that he sign an [[affidavit]] about the encounter. Bostock's deposition details Teach's command of two vessels: a sloop and a large French guineaman, Dutch-built, with 36&nbsp;cannon and a crew of 300&nbsp;men.

Henry Bostock claimed to have heard the pirates say they would head toward the Spanish-controlled [[Saman\u00e1 Bay]] in Hispaniola, but a cursory search revealed no pirate activity.  Captain Hume of {{HMS|Scarborough|1711}} reported on 6&nbsp;February that a \"Pyrate Ship of 36&nbsp;Guns and 250&nbsp;men, and a Sloop of 10&nbsp;Guns and 100&nbsp;men were Said to be Cruizing amongst the Leeward Islands\".

Teach may have understood this and surrendered to a pardon of 5&nbsp;September 1717.  The proclamation offered rewards to those persons who captured pirates who refused to surrender, covered incidences of murder committed during acts of piracy and allowed those who had suffered the theft of their property the right to recover their goods\u2014but only through legal channels.  Teach therefore would have been under no obligation to surrender his loot to the Crown.  According to Lee (1974), if Teach did surrender, ''Queen Anne's Revenge'' would likely have been anchored at [[Ocracoke Inlet]], from which place he would have travelled to [[Bath, North Carolina]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|pp=28\u201330}}</ref> -->\nIn March 1718, while taking on water at Turneffe Island east of [[Belize]], both ships spotted the Jamaican logwood cutting sloop ''Adventure'' making for the harbour.

They then sailed to the wrecks of the [[1715 Treasure Fleet|1715 Spanish fleet]], off the eastern coast of [[Florida]].  There Teach disembarked the crew of the captured Spanish sloop, before proceeding north to the port of Charles Town, South Carolina, attacking three vessels along the way.<ref>{{Harvnb|Konstam|2007|p=130}}</ref>\n\n===Blockade of Charles Town===\nBy May 1718, Teach had awarded himself the rank of [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] and was at the height of his power. Late that month his flotilla blockaded the port of Charles Town in the [[Province of South Carolina]]. All vessels entering or leaving the port were stopped, and as the town had no [[guard ship]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Konstam|2007|p=164}}</ref> its [[pilot boat]] was the first to be captured. Over the next five or six days about nine vessels were stopped and ransacked as they attempted to sail past [[Charleston Bar|Charles Town Bar]], where Teach's fleet was anchored. One such ship, headed for London with a group of prominent Charles Town citizens which included Samuel Wragg (a member of the Council of the Province of Carolina), was the ''Crowley''.  Her passengers were questioned about the vessels still in port and then locked below decks for about half a day. Teach informed the prisoners that his fleet required medical supplies from the colonial government of South Carolina, and that if none were forthcoming, all prisoners would be executed, their heads sent to the Governor and all captured ships burnt.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|pp=39\u201342}}</ref>\n\nWragg agreed to Teach's demands, and a Mr. Marks and two pirates were given two days to collect the drugs. Teach moved his fleet, and the captured ships, to within about five or six [[League (unit)|leagues]] from land. Three days later a messenger, sent by Marks, returned to the fleet; Marks's boat had capsized and delayed their arrival in Charles Town. Teach granted a reprieve of two days, but still the party did not return. He then called a meeting of his fellow sailors and moved eight ships into the harbour, causing panic within the town. When Marks finally returned to the fleet, he explained what had happened. On his arrival he had presented the pirates' demands to the Governor and the drugs had been quickly gathered, but the two pirates sent to escort him had proved difficult to find; they had been busy drinking with friends and were finally discovered, drunk.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|pp=42\u201347}}</ref>\n\nTeach kept to his side of the bargain and released the captured ships and his prisoners\u2014albeit relieved of their valuables, including the fine clothing some had worn.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|p=47}}</ref>\n\n===Beaufort Inlet===\nWhilst at Charles Town, Teach learned that Woodes Rogers had left England with several [[Man-of-war|men-of-war]], with orders to purge the West Indies of pirates.  Teach's flotilla sailed northward along the Atlantic coast and into [[Topsail Inlet]] (commonly known as Beaufort Inlet), off the coast of North Carolina.  There they intended to [[Careening|careen]] their ships to scrape their hulls, but on 10 June, 1718 the ''Queen Anne's Revenge'' ran aground on a sandbar, cracking her [[main-mast]] and severely damaging many of her timbers.  Teach ordered several sloops to throw ropes across the flagship in an attempt to free her.  A sloop commanded by [[Israel Hands]] of ''Adventure'' also ran aground, and both vessels appeared to be damaged beyond repair,<ref>{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|pp=50\u201351}}</ref> leaving only ''Revenge'' and the captured Spanish sloop.<ref>{{Harvnb|Konstam|2007|p=183}}</ref>\n\nTeach had at some stage learnt of the offer of a royal pardon and probably confided in Bonnet his willingness to accept it.  The pardon was open to all pirates who surrendered on or before 5&nbsp;September 1718, but contained a caveat stipulating that immunity was offered only against crimes committed before 5&nbsp;January.  Although in theory this left Bonnet and Teach at risk of being hanged for their actions at Charles Town Bar, most authorities could waive such conditions.  Teach thought that Governor [[Charles Eden (politician)|Charles Eden]] was a man he could trust, but to make sure, he waited to see what would happen to another captain.<ref>{{Harvnb|Konstam|2007|pp=183\u2013185}}</ref>  Bonnet left immediately on a small sailing boat{{refn|Possibly a longboat from ''Queen Anne's Revenge''.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}|group=\"nb\"}} for Bath Town, where he surrendered to Governor Eden, and received his pardon.  He then travelled back to Beaufort Inlet to collect the ''Revenge'' and the remainder of his crew, intending to sail to [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|Saint Thomas Island]] to receive a commission.  Unfortunately for him, Teach had stripped the vessel of its valuables and provisions, and had marooned its crew; Bonnet set out for revenge, but was unable to find him.  He and his crew returned to piracy and were captured on 27&nbsp;September 1718 at the mouth of the [[Cape Fear River]].  All but four were tried and hanged in Charles Town.<ref name=\"Leepp5254\">{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|pp=52\u201354}}</ref>{{refn|The captured ''Revenge'' was later included in a fleet of ships commanded by the Governor of South Carolina.  The fleet made a ferocious attack on a group of pirates near the entrance to Charles Town Harbour, resulting in the execution of 49&nbsp;pirates inside a month.  Their bodies were hung in [[gibbet]]s near [[Battery Park (Charleston)|White Point]].<ref name=\"Leepp5254\"/>|group=\"nb\"}}\n\nThe author Robert Lee surmised that Teach and Hands intentionally ran the ships aground to reduce the fleet's crew complement, increasing their share of the spoils.  During the trial of Bonnet's crew, ''Revenge''{{'}}s [[boatswain]] Ignatius Pell testified that \"the ship was run ashore and lost, which Thatch [Teach] caused to be done.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Cobbett|Howell|Howell|1816|p=1249}}</ref>  Lee considers it plausible that Teach let Bonnet in on his plan to accept a pardon from Governor Eden.  He suggested that Bonnet do the same, and as war between the [[War of the Quadruple Alliance|Quadruple Alliance of 1718]] and Spain was threatening, to consider taking a privateer's commission from England.  Lee suggests that Teach also offered Bonnet the return of his ship ''Revenge''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|pp=51\u201352}}</ref>  Konstam (2007) proposes a similar idea, explaining that Teach began to see ''Queen Anne's Revenge'' as something of a liability; while a pirate fleet was anchored, news of this was sent to neighbouring towns and colonies, and any vessels nearby would delay sailing.  It was prudent therefore for Teach not to linger for too long, although wrecking the ship was a somewhat extreme measure.<ref>{{Harvnb|Konstam|2007|pp=150,&nbsp;167}}</ref>\n\n===Pardon===\n[[File:Ocracoke inlet north carolina 1775.jpg|right|thumb|A map of the area around [[Ocracoke Inlet]], 1775]]\nBefore sailing northward on his remaining sloop to [[Ocracoke Inlet]], Teach marooned about 25&nbsp;men on a small sandy island about a league from the mainland.  He may have done this to stifle any protest they made, if they guessed their captain's plans.  Bonnet rescued them two days later.<ref>{{Harvnb|Konstam|2007|p=187}}</ref>  Teach continued on to Bath, where in June 1718\u2014only days after Bonnet had departed with his pardon\u2014he and his much-reduced crew received their pardon from Governor Eden.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|pp=52\u201353,&nbsp;56}}</ref>\n\nHe settled in Bath, on the eastern side of Bath Creek at Plum Point, near Eden's home.  During July and August he travelled between his base in the town and his sloop off Ocracoke.  Johnson's account states that he [[Mary Ormond|married]] the daughter of a local plantation owner, although there is no supporting evidence for this.  Eden gave Teach permission to sail to St Thomas to seek a commission as a privateer (a useful way of removing bored and troublesome pirates from the small settlement), and Teach was given official title to his remaining sloop, which he renamed ''Adventure''.  By the end of August he had returned to piracy, and in the same month the Governor of Pennsylvania issued a warrant for his arrest, but by then Teach was probably operating in [[Delaware Bay]], some distance away.  He took two French ships leaving the Caribbean, moved one crew across to the other, and sailed the remaining ship back to Ocracoke.<ref>{{Harvnb|Konstam|2007|pp=198\u2013202}}</ref>  In September he told Eden that he had found the French ship at sea, deserted.  A [[Vice admiralty court|Vice Admiralty Court]] was quickly convened, presided over by Tobias Knight and the Collector of Customs.  The ship was judged as a derelict found at sea, and of its cargo twenty&nbsp;[[hogshead]]s of sugar were awarded to Knight and sixty&nbsp;to Eden; Teach and his crew were given what remained in the vessel's hold.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|p=80}}</ref>\n\nOcracoke Inlet was Teach's favourite anchorage.  It was a perfect vantage point from which to view ships travelling between the various settlements of northeast Carolina, and it was from there that Teach first spotted the approaching ship of [[Charles Vane]], another English pirate.  Several months earlier Vane had rejected the pardon brought by Woodes Rogers and escaped the men-of-war the English captain brought with him to [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]].  He had also been pursued by Teach's old commander, Benjamin Hornigold, who was by then a pirate hunter.  Teach and Vane spent several nights on the southern tip of Ocracoke Island, accompanied by such notorious figures as Israel Hands, Robert Deal and [[Calico Jack]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|pp=85,88\u201390}}</ref>\n\n===Alexander Spotswood===\nAs it spread throughout the neighbouring colonies, the news of Teach and Vane's impromptu party worried the Governor of Pennsylvania enough to send out two sloops to capture the pirates.<ref>{{Harvnb|Konstam|2007|pp=204\u2013205}}</ref>  They were unsuccessful, but Governor of Virginia Alexander Spotswood was also concerned that the supposedly retired freebooter and his crew were living in nearby North Carolina.  Some of Teach's former crew had already moved into several Virginian seaport towns, prompting Spotswood to issue a proclamation on 10&nbsp;July, requiring all former pirates to make themselves known to the authorities, to give up their arms and to not travel in groups larger than three.  As head of a [[Crown colony]], Spotswood viewed the [[proprietary colony]] of North Carolina with contempt; he had little faith in the ability of the Carolinians to control the pirates, who he suspected would be back to their old ways, disrupting Virginian commerce, as soon as their money ran out.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|pp=94\u201395}}</ref>\n[[File:General History of the Pyrates - Blackbeard the Pirate (1725).jpg|thumb|upright|''Blackbeard the Pirate'': this was published in the ''[[A General History of the Pyrates|General History of the Pyrates]]'', 1725.]]\nSpotswood learnt that William Howard, the former quartermaster of ''Queen Anne's Revenge'', was in the area, and believing that he might know of Teach's whereabouts had the pirate and his two slaves arrested.

The charges referred to several acts of piracy supposedly committed after the pardon's cut-off date, in \"a sloop belonging to ye subjects of the King of Spain\", but ignored the fact that they took place outside Spotswood's jurisdiction and in a vessel then legally owned.  Another charge cited two attacks, one of which was the capture of a slave ship off Charles Town Bar, from which one of Howard's slaves was presumed to have come.  Howard was sent to await trial before a Court of Vice-Admiralty, on the charge of piracy, but Brand and his colleague, Captain Gordon (of {{HMS|Pearl|1708|6}}) refused to serve with Holloway present.{{refn|The two captains refused as Holloway was involved in the civil action.|group=\"nb\"}}  Incensed, Holloway had no option but to stand down, and was replaced by the [[Attorney General of Virginia]], John Clayton, whom Spotswood described as \"an honester man [than Holloway]\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|p=104}}</ref>  Howard was found guilty and sentenced to be hanged, but was saved by a commission from London, which directed Spotswood to pardon all acts of piracy committed by surrendering pirates before 23&nbsp;July 1718.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|pp=104\u2013105}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Konstam|2007|pp=205\u2013207}}</ref>\n\nSpotswood had obtained from Howard valuable information on Teach's whereabouts,<ref>{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|p=105}}</ref> and he planned to send his forces across the border into North Carolina to capture him.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|p=106}}</ref>  He gained the support of two men keen to discredit North Carolina's Governor\u2014Edward Moseley and Colonel Maurice Moore.  He also wrote to the [[Board of Trade|Lords of Trade]], suggesting that the Crown might benefit financially from Teach's capture.  Spotswood personally financed the operation, possibly believing that Teach had fabulous treasures hidden away.  He ordered Captains Gordon and Brand of HMS ''Pearl'' and HMS ''Lyme'' to travel overland to Bath.  Lieutenant Robert Maynard of HMS ''Pearl'' was given command of two commandeered sloops, to approach the town from the sea.{{refn|HMS ''Pearl'' and HMS ''Lyme'' drew too much water and were therefore unable to navigate the sandbars around Ocracoke.<ref>{{Harvnb|Konstam|2007|p=241}}</ref>|group=\"nb\"}}  An extra incentive for Teach's capture was the offer of a reward from the Assembly of Virginia, over and above any that might be received from the Crown.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|pp=108\u2013110}}</ref>\n\nMaynard took command of the two armed sloops on 17&nbsp;November.  He was given 57&nbsp;men\u201433&nbsp;from HMS ''Pearl'' and 24 from HMS ''Lyme''.  Maynard and the detachment from HMS ''Pearl'' took the larger of the two vessels and named her ''Jane''; the rest took ''Ranger'', commanded by one of Maynard's officers, a Mister Hyde.

Brand set out for North Carolina six days later, arriving within three miles of Bath on 23&nbsp;November.  Included in Brand's force were several North Carolinians, including Colonel Moore and Captain Jeremiah Vail, sent to put down any local objection to the presence of foreign soldiers.  Moore went into the town to see if Teach was there, reporting back that he was not, but that the pirate was expected at \"every minute.\"  Brand then went to Governor Eden's home and informed him of his purpose.  The next day, Brand sent two canoes down [[Pamlico River]] to Ocracoke Inlet, to see if Teach could be seen.  They returned two days later and reported on what eventually transpired.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|pp=111\u2013112}}</ref>\n\n===Last battle===\nMaynard found the pirates anchored on the inner side of [[Ocracoke, North Carolina|Ocracoke Island]], on the evening of 21&nbsp;November.<ref>{{Harvnb|Woodard|2007|pp=289\u2013290}}</ref>  He had ascertained their position from ships he had stopped along his journey, but unfamiliar with the local channels and shoals he decided to wait until the following morning to make his attack.

With Israel Hands ashore in Bath with about&nbsp;24 of ''Adventure''{{'}}s sailors, he also had a much-reduced crew.  Johnson (1724) reported that the pirate had \"no more than twenty-five men on board\" and that he \"gave out to all the vessels that he spoke with that he had forty\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Johnson|1724|p=81}}</ref>  \"Thirteen white and six Negroes\", was the number later reported by Brand to the Admiralty.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|p=210}}</ref>\n\nAt daybreak, preceded by a small boat taking [[Depth sounding|soundings]], Maynard's two sloops entered the channel.  The small craft was quickly spotted by ''Adventure'' and fired at as soon as it was within range of her guns.  While the boat made a quick retreat to the ''Jane'', Teach cut the ''Adventure''{{'}}s anchor cable.  His crew hoisted the sails and the ''Adventure'' manoeuvred to point her starboard guns toward Maynard's sloops, which were slowly closing the gap.<ref>{{Harvnb|Konstam|2007|pp=246\u2013248}}</ref>  Hyde moved ''Ranger'' to the port side of ''Jane'' and the [[Union flag]] was unfurled on each ship.  ''Adventure'' then turned toward the beach of Ocracoke Island, heading for a narrow channel.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|pp=115\u2013117}}</ref>  What happened next is uncertain.  Johnson claimed that there was an exchange of small-arms fire following which ''Adventure'' ran aground on a [[Shoal|sandbar]], and Maynard anchored and then lightened his ship to pass over the obstacle.

Teach watched as the gap between the vessels closed,  and ordered his men to be ready.  The two vessels contacted one another as the ''Adventure''{{'}}s grappling hooks hit their target and several grenades, made from powder and shot-filled bottles and ignited by fuses, broke across the sloop's deck.  As the smoke cleared, Teach led his men aboard, buoyant at the sight of Maynard's apparently empty ship, his men firing at the small group formed by the lieutenant and his men at the [[stern]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|pp=119\u2013120}}</ref>\n\nThe rest of Maynard's men then burst from the hold, shouting and firing.  The plan to surprise Teach and his crew worked; the pirates were apparently taken aback at the assault.  Teach rallied his men and the two groups fought across the deck, which was already slick with blood from those killed or injured by Teach's broadside.  Maynard and Teach fired their [[flintlock]]s at each other, then threw them away.  Teach drew his cutlass and managed to break Maynard's sword.  Against superior training and a slight advantage in numbers, the pirates were pushed back toward the bow, allowing the ''Jane''{{'}}s crew to surround Maynard and Teach, who was by then completely isolated.<ref>{{Harvnb|Konstam|2007|pp=255\u2013257}}</ref>  As Maynard drew back to fire once again, Teach moved in to attack him, but was slashed across the neck by one of Maynard's men.  Badly wounded, he was then attacked and killed by several more of Maynard's crew.  The remaining pirates quickly surrendered.  Those left on the ''Adventure'' were captured by the ''Ranger''{{'}}s crew, including one who planned to set fire to the powder room and blow up the ship.  Varying accounts exist of the battle's list of casualties; Maynard reported that&nbsp;8 of his men and 12&nbsp;pirates were killed.  Brand reported that 10&nbsp;pirates and 11&nbsp;of Maynard's men were killed.  Spotswood claimed ten&nbsp;pirates and ten&nbsp;of the King's men dead.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|pp=120\u2013123}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Blackbeard's head.jpg|thumb|upright|Edward Teach's severed head hangs from Maynard's bowsprit, as pictured in Charles Elles's ''The Pirates Own Book'' (1837)]]\nMaynard later examined Teach's body, noting that it had been shot five times and cut about twenty.  He also found several items of correspondence, including a letter to the pirate from Tobias Knight.  Teach's corpse was thrown into the inlet and his head was suspended from the [[bowsprit]] of Maynard's sloop so that the reward could be collected.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|pp=122, 124}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nLieutenant Maynard remained at Ocracoke for several more days, making repairs and burying the dead.<ref>{{Harvnb|Konstam|2007|p=259}}</ref>  Teach's loot\u2014sugar, cocoa, [[Indigo dye|indigo]] and cotton\u2014found \"in pirate sloops and ashore in a tent where the sloops lay\", was sold at auction along with sugar and cotton found in Tobias Knight's barn, for \u00a32,238.  Governor Spotswood used a portion of this to pay for the entire operation.  The prize money for capturing Teach was to have been about \u00a3400, but it was split between the crews of HMS ''Lyme'' and HMS ''Pearl''.  As Captain Brand and his troops had not been the ones fighting for their lives, Maynard thought this extremely unfair.  He lost much of any support he may have had though when it was discovered that he and his crew had helped themselves to about \u00a390 of Teach's booty.  The two companies did not receive their prize money for another four years,<ref>{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|p=139}}</ref><ref name=\"Leepp125126\">{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|pp=125\u2013126}}</ref> and despite his bravery Maynard was not promoted; instead, he faded into obscurity.<ref>{{Harvnb|Konstam|2007|pp=272\u2013274}}</ref>\n\nThe remainder of Teach's crew and former associates were found by Brand, in Bath,<ref name=\"Leepp125126\"/> and were transported to [[Williamsburg, Virginia]], where they were jailed on charges of piracy.  Several were black, prompting Spotswood to ask his council what could be done about \"the Circumstances of these Negroes to exempt them from undergoing the same Tryal as other pirates.\"  Regardless, the men were tried with their comrades in Williamsburg's Capitol building, under admiralty law, on 12&nbsp;March 1719.  No records of the day's proceedings remain, but 14&nbsp;of the 16&nbsp;accused were found guilty.  Of the remaining two, one proved that he had partaken of the fight out of necessity, having been on Teach's ship only as a guest at a drinking party the night before, and not as a pirate.  The other, Israel Hands, was not present at the fight.  He claimed that during a drinking session Teach had shot him in the knee, and that he was still covered by the royal pardon.{{refn|Konstam (2007) suggests that while imprisoned, Hands was an informant for Spotswood.<ref>{{Harvnb|Konstam|2007|p=271}}</ref>|group=\"nb\"}}  The remaining <!-- 13 - will have to check this number -->pirates were [[Hanging#Short drop|hanged]], then left to rot in [[gibbet]]s along Williamsburg's Capitol Landing Road (known for some time after as \"Gallows Road\").<ref>{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|pp=136\u2013138}}</ref>\n\nGovernor Eden was certainly embarrassed by Spotswood's invasion of North Carolina,<ref>{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|p=127}}</ref> and Spotswood disavowed himself of any part of the seizure.  He defended his actions, writing to [[John Carteret, 2nd Earl Granville|Lord Carteret]], a shareholder of the Province of Carolina, that he might benefit from the sale of the seized property and reminding the Earl of the number of Virginians who had died to protect his interests.  He argued for the secrecy of the operation by suggesting that Eden \"could contribute nothing to the Success of the Design\", and told Eden that his authority to capture the pirates came from the king.  Eden was heavily criticised for his involvement with Teach and was accused of being his accomplice.  By criticising Eden, Spotswood intended to bolster the legitimacy of his invasion.<ref>{{Harvnb|Konstam|2007|p=233}}</ref>  Lee (1974) concludes that although Spotswood may have thought that the ends justified the means, he had no legal authority to invade North Carolina, to capture the pirates and to seize and auction their goods.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|pp=127\u2013135}}</ref>  Eden doubtless shared the same view.  As Spotswood had also accused Tobias Knight of being in league with Teach, on 4&nbsp;April 1719, Eden had Knight brought in for questioning.  Israel Hands had, weeks earlier, testified that Knight had been on board the ''Adventure'' in August 1718, shortly after Teach had brought a French ship to North Carolina as a prize.  Four pirates had testified that with Teach, they had visited Knight's home to give him presents.  This testimony and the letter found on Teach's body by Maynard appeared compelling, but Knight conducted his defence with competence.  Despite being very sick and close to death, he questioned the reliability of Spotswood's witnesses.  He claimed that Israel Hands had talked under duress, and that under North Carolinian law, the other witness, an African, was unable to testify.  The sugar, he argued, was stored at his house legally, and Teach had visited him only on business, in his official capacity.  The board found Knight innocent of all charges.  He died later that year.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|pp=143\u2013153}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Konstam|2007|pp=274\u2013277}}</ref>\n\nEden was annoyed that the accusations against Knight arose during a trial in which he played no part.  The goods which Brand seized were officially North Carolinian property and Eden considered him a thief.  The argument raged back and forth between the colonies until Eden's death on 17&nbsp;March 1722.  His will named one of Spotswood's opponents, John Holloway, a beneficiary.  In the same year, Spotswood, who for years had fought his enemies in the [[House of Burgesses]] and the Council, was replaced by [[Hugh Drysdale]], once [[Robert Walpole]] was convinced to act.<ref name=\"Leepp98101\"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Konstam|2007|pp=276\u2013280}}</ref>\n\n==Modern view==\n{{See also|Blackbeard in popular culture}}\n<!-- Please see the relevant talk page discussion on Pirates of the Caribbean 4 before adding any information about that film, here. -->\n{{Quote box |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center | quote = We normally think about pirates as sort of blood-lusting, that they want to slash somebody to pieces.

Privateers who became pirates were generally considered by the English government to be reserve naval forces, and were sometimes given active encouragement; as far back as 1581 [[Francis Drake]] was knighted by [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]], when he returned to England from a round-the-world expedition with plunder worth an estimated \u00a31,500,000.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|p=5}}</ref>  Royal pardons were regularly issued, usually when England was on the verge of war, and the public's opinion of pirates was often favourable, some considering them akin to patrons.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lee|1974|p=168}}</ref> Economist [[Peter Leeson]] believes that pirates were generally shrewd businessmen, far removed from the modern, romanticised view of them as barbarians.<ref name=\"Leeson\"/>  After Woodes Rogers' 1718 landing at New Providence and his ending of the [[Republic of Pirates|pirate republic]], piracy in the West Indies fell into terminal decline.  With no easily accessible outlet to fence their stolen goods, pirates were reduced to a subsistence livelihood, and following almost a century of naval warfare between the British, French and Spanish\u2014during which sailors could find easy employment\u2014lone privateers found themselves outnumbered by the powerful ships employed by the [[British Empire]] to defend its merchant fleets.  The popularity of the slave trade helped bring to an end the frontier condition of the West Indies, and in these circumstances, piracy was no longer able to flourish as it once did.<ref>{{Harvnb|Woodbury|1951|pp=201\u2013208}}</ref>\n\nSince the end of this so-called [[golden age of piracy]], Teach and his exploits have become the stuff of lore, inspiring books, films and even amusement park rides.  Much of what is known about him can be sourced to Charles Johnson's ''[[A General Historie of the Robberies and Murders of the Most Notorious Pyrates]]'', published in Britain in 1724.<ref>{{Harvnb|Woodard|2007|p=325}}</ref>  A recognised authority on the pirates of his time, Johnson's descriptions of such figures as [[Anne Bonny]] and [[Mary Read]] were for years required reading for those interested in the subject.<ref name=\"Leepp89\"/>  Readers were titillated by his stories and a second edition was quickly published, though author Angus Konstam suspects that Johnson's entry on Blackbeard was \"coloured a little to make a more sensational story.\"{{refn|Amongst many questionable \"facts\" in Johnson's account is the encounter between Teach and {{HMS|Scarborough|1711|6}}.<ref>{{Harvnb|Konstam|2007|p=90}}</ref>  Neither the log of the ''Scarborough'' nor the letters of its captain mention such an encounter; historian Colin Woodard believes that Johnson confused and conflated two actual events: the ''Scarborough''{{'}}s battle against John Martel's band and Blackbeard's close encounter with another warship, {{HMS|Seaford|1697|6}}.<ref>{{Harvnb|Woodard|2007|pp=222\u2013223}}</ref>|group=\"nb\"}}  ''A General Historie'', though, is generally considered to be a reliable source.<ref name=\"Konstamp4\">{{Harvnb|Konstam|2007|p=4}}</ref><ref name=\"Konstampp12\">{{Harvnb|Konstam|2007|pp=1\u20132}}</ref>  Johnson may have been an assumed alias.

The available records include nothing to suggest that the burial of treasure was a common practice, except in the imaginations of the writers of fictional accounts such as ''[[Treasure Island]]''.

Bugzilla was originally written in [[Tcl]], but Weissman decided to port it to [[Perl]] before its release as part of Netscape's early open source code drops, in the hope that more people would be able to contribute to it, given that Perl seemed to be a more popular language at the time.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bugzilla.org/status/roadmap.html#history | title = Brief History | work = Development Roadmap | publisher = Mozilla.org | accessdate = 2006-11-22 }}</ref>\n\nBugzilla 2.0 was the result of that port to Perl, and the first version was released to the public via anonymous [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]]. In April 2000, Weissman handed over control of the Bugzilla project to [[Tara Hernandez]]. Under her leadership, some of the regular contributors were coerced into taking more responsibility, and Bugzilla development became more community-driven. In July 2001, facing distraction from her other responsibilities in Netscape, Hernandez handed control to Dave Miller, who was still in charge {{as of|2013|lc=on}}.<ref name=\"bugzilla-dev-profiles\">{{cite web | url = http://www.bugzilla.org/developers/profiles.html | title = Developer Profiles | work = Bugzilla Website | publisher = Mozilla.org | accessdate = 2013-07-02 }}</ref>\n\nBugzilla 3.0 was released on May 10, 2007 and brought refreshed [[User interface|UI]], [[XML-RPC]] interface, custom fields and resolutions, [[mod_perl]]<!-- THE UNDERSCORE IS DELIBERATE --> support, shared saved searches, and improved [[UTF-8]] support, along with other changes.\n\nBugzilla 4.0 was released on February 15, 2011 and Bugzilla 5.0 was released in July 2015. \n\n=== Timeline ===\n\nBugzilla's release timeline:<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.bugzilla.org/releases/ |title = Release Dates |work=Release Information |publisher=Mozilla.org |accessdate=2011-03-31 }}</ref>\n\n<timeline>\nDefine $now = 26/06/2018\nDefine $width = 556\nDefine $warning = 436 #

Bugzilla is usually installed on [[Linux]] using the [[Apache HTTP Server]], but any web server that supports [[Common Gateway Interface|CGI]] such as [[Lighttpd]], [[Hiawatha (web server)|Hiawatha]], [[Cherokee (web server)|Cherokee]] can be used. Bugzilla's installation process is [[command line]] driven and runs through a series of stages where system requirements and software capabilities are checked.\n\n== Design ==\n[[Image:Bugzilla Lifecycle color-aqua.svg|thumb|270px|The lifecycle of a Bugzilla bug]]\n\nWhile the potential exists in the code to turn Bugzilla into a [[issue tracking system|technical support ticket system]], task management tool, or project management tool, Bugzilla's developers have chosen to focus on the task of designing a system to track software defects. Mandated design requirements include:<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bugzilla.org/status/roadmap.html#design | title = Design Principles | work = Development Roadmap | publisher = Mozilla.org | accessdate = 2006-11-22 }}</ref>\n\n* The ability to run on freely available, open-source tools. While Bugzilla development includes work to support commercial databases, tools, and operating systems.\n* The maintenance of speed and efficiency at all costs. One of Bugzilla's major attractions to developers is its lightweight implementation and speed, so calls into the database are minimized whenever possible, data fetching is kept as light as possible, and generation of heavy [[HTML]] is avoided.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n* Tickets. For instance, Mozilla.org uses it to track feature requests as well. In this case items (called bugs) can be submitted by anybody, and will be assigned to a particular developer. Various status updates for each bug are allowed, together with user notes and bug examples.\n\nIn practice, most Bugzilla projects allowing the public to file bugs&mdash;such as the  Bugzilla bug database for Bugzilla itself&mdash;assign all bugs to a gatekeeper, whose job it is to assign responsibility and priority level.\n\n== Zarro Boogs ==\n<!-- linked from redirect [[Zarro boogs]] -->\nBy design, Bugzilla is programmed to return the string \"zarro boogs found\" instead of \"0 bugs found\" when a search for bugs returns no results.<ref name=\"zarro\">{{cite web | url = http://www.bugzilla.org/docs/3.0/html/glossary.html#gloss-zarro | title = Bugzilla Guide glossary entry for ''Zarro Boogs Found'' | work = Glossary | publisher = Bugzilla.org | accessdate = 2008-04-21}}</ref> \"Zarro Boogs\" is a meta-statement about the nature of software [[software bug|debugging]].

When asked to explain this message, Terry Weissman (an early Bugzilla developer) had the following to say:\n\n:I've been asked to explain this ... way back when, when Netscape released version 4.0 of its browser, we had a release party. Naturally, there had been a big push to try and fix every known bug before the release. Naturally, that hadn't actually happened.  (This is not unique to Netscape or to 4.0; the same thing has happened with every software project I've ever seen.) Anyway, at the release party, T-shirts were handed out that said something like \"Netscape 4.0: Zarro Boogs\". Just like the software, the T-shirt had no known bugs. Uh-huh. So, when you query for a list of bugs, and it gets no results, you can think of this as a friendly reminder.

Ballads derive from the medieval [[Music of France|French]] ''chanson ballad\u00e9e'' or ''[[Ballade (forme fixe)|ballade]]'', which were originally \"danced songs<nowiki>''</nowiki>. Ballads were particularly characteristic of the popular poetry and song of the British Isles from the later [[medieval]] period until the 19th century. They were widely used across [[Europe]], and later in [[Australia]], [[North Africa]], [[North America]] and [[South America]]. Ballads are often 13 lines with an ABABBCBC form, consisting of couplets (two lines) of rhymed verse, each of 14 syllables. Another common form is ABAB or ABCB repeated, in alternating 8 and 6 syllable lines.\n\nMany ballads were written and sold as single sheet [[Broadside (music)|broadsides]]. The form was often used by [[poet]]s and [[composer]]s from the 18th century onwards to produce lyrical ballads. In the later 19th century, the term took on the meaning of a slow form of popular [[love song]] and is now often used for any love song, particularly the [[sentimental ballad]] of [[pop music|pop]] or [[rock music|rock]].\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:Here begynneth a gest of Robyn Hode.png|thumb|upright|A sixteenth-century printed ballad, the [[A Gest of Robyn Hode]]]]\nThe ballad derives its name from medieval [[French language|French]] dance songs or \"ballares\" ([[Latin|L]]: ''ballare'', to dance),<ref>W. Apel, ''Harvard Dictionary of Music'' (Harvard, 1944; 2nd edn., 1972), p. 70.</ref> from which 'ballet' is also derived, as did the alternative rival form that became the French [[Ballade (forme fixe)|ballade]].<ref>A. Jacobs, ''A Short History of Western Music'' (1972, Penguin, 1976), p. 21.</ref><ref>W. Apel, ''Harvard Dictionary of Music'' (1944, Harvard, 1972), pp. 70-72.</ref> As a narrative song, their theme and function may originate from [[Scandinavia]]n and [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] traditions of storytelling that can be seen in poems such as [[Beowulf]].<ref name=Houseman1952>J. E. Housman, ''British Popular Ballads'' (1952, London: Ayer Publishing, 1969), p. 15.</ref> Musically they were influenced by the [[Minnesinger]].<ref>A. Jacobs, ''A Short History of Western Music'' (Penguin 1972, 1976), p. 20.</ref> The earliest example of a recognizable ballad in form in [[England]] is \"[[Judas (ballad)|Judas]]\" in a 13th-century [[manuscript]].<ref name=\"N. Bold, 1979 p. 5\">A. N. Bold, ''The Ballad'' (Routledge, 1979), p. 5.</ref>\nThis means that the two words, ballad and ballet, are both derived from the French language.\n\n==Ballad form==\n{{See also|AABA form}}\nBallads were originally written to accompany dances, and so were composed in couplets with refrains in alternate lines. These refrains would have been sung by the dancers in time with the dance.<ref name=\"British Literature pg 610\">\"Popular Ballads\", ''The Broadview Anthology of British Literature: The Restoration and the Eighteenth Century'', p. 610.</ref> Most northern and west European ballads are written in [[ballad stanza]]s or [[quatrains]] (four-line [[stanzas]]) of alternating lines of [[Iamb (foot)|iambic]] (an unstressed followed by a stressed syllable) [[tetrameter]] (eight syllables) and iambic [[trimeter]] (six syllables), known as [[Common metre#Variants|ballad meter]]. Usually, only the second and fourth line of a quatrain are rhymed (in the scheme a, b, c, b), which has been taken to suggest that, originally, ballads consisted of couplets (two lines) of rhymed verse, each of 14 syllables.<ref name=\"I. Ousby, 2006 p. 66\">D. Head and I. Ousby, ''The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English'' (Cambridge University Press, 2006), p. 66.</ref> This can be seen in this stanza from \"[[Lord Thomas and Fair Annet]]\":\n\nThe '''horse''' | fair '''Ann''' | et '''rode''' | up'''on''' |<br />\nHe '''amb''' | led '''like''' | the '''wind''' |,<br />\nWith '''sil''' | ver '''he''' | was '''shod''' | be'''fore''',<br />\nWith '''burn''' | ing '''gold''' | be'''hind''' |.<ref name=Houseman1952/>\n\nThere is considerable variation on this pattern in almost every respect, including length, number of lines and rhyming scheme, making the strict definition of a ballad extremely difficult. In southern and eastern Europe, and in countries that derive their tradition from them, ballad structure differs significantly, like Spanish ''romanceros'', which are [[octosyllabic]] and use [[Literary consonance|consonance]] rather than rhyme.<ref>T. A. Green, ''Folklore: An Encyclopedia of Beliefs, Customs, Tales, Music, and Art'' ([[ABC-CLIO]], 1997), p. 81.</ref>\n\nBallads usually are heavily influenced by the regions in which they originate and use the common dialect of the people. [[Scotland]]'s ballads in particular, both in theme and language, are strongly characterised by their distinctive tradition, even exhibiting some pre-Christian influences in the inclusion of supernatural elements such as travel to the [[Fairy]] Kingdom in the [[Scots language|Scots]] ballad \"Tam Lin\".<ref>\"Popular Ballads\" ''The Broadview Anthology of British Literature: The Restoration and the Eighteenth Century'', pp. 610-17.</ref> The ballads do not have any known author or correct version; instead, having been passed down mainly by oral tradition since the Middle Ages, there are many variations of each. The ballads remained an oral tradition until the increased interest in folk songs in the 18th century led collectors such as [[Thomas Percy (bishop of Dromore)|Bishop Thomas Percy]] (1729\u20131811) to publish volumes of popular ballads.<ref name=\"British Literature pg 610\"/>\n\nIn all traditions most ballads are narrative in nature, with a self-contained story, often concise, and rely on imagery, rather than description, which can be tragic, historical, romantic or comic.<ref name=\"I. Ousby, 2006 p. 66\"/> Themes concerning rural laborers and their sexuality are common, and there are many ballads based on the Robin Hood legend.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/review/980|title=Songs of Protest, Songs of Love: Popular Ballads in Eighteenth-Century Britain {{!}} Reviews in History|website=www.history.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-12-12}}</ref> Another common feature of ballads is repetition, sometimes of fourth lines in succeeding stanzas, as a [[refrain]], sometimes of third and fourth lines of a stanza and sometimes of entire stanzas.<ref name=Houseman1952/>\n\n==Composition==\n[[File:Scott's Minstrelsy Of The Scottish Border.JPG|thumb|A copy of [[Walter Scott|Walter Scott's]] ''The Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border''.]]\nScholars of ballads have been divided into \"communalists\", such as [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] (1744\u20131803) and the [[Brothers Grimm]], who argue that ballads are originally communal compositions, and \"individualists\" such as [[Cecil Sharp]], who assert that there was one single original author.<ref name=\"N. Bold, 1979 p. 5\"/> Communalists tend to see more recent, particularly printed, broadside ballads of known authorship as a debased form of the genre, while individualists see variants as corruptions of an original text.<ref>M. Hawkins-Dady, ''Reader's Guide to Literature in English'' (Taylor & Francis, 1996), p. 54.</ref> More recently scholars have pointed to the interchange of oral and written forms of the ballad.<ref name=\"A. Green, 1997 p. 353\">T. A. Green, ''Folklore: An Encyclopedia of Beliefs, Customs, Tales, Music, and Art'' (ABC-CLIO, 1997), p. 353.</ref>\n\n==Transmission==\nThe transmission of ballads comprises a key stage in their re-composition. In romantic terms this process is often dramatized as a narrative of degeneration away from the pure 'folk memory' or 'immemorial tradition'.<ref>Ruth Finnegan, ''Oral Poetry: Its Nature, Significance and Social Context'' (Cambridge University Press, 1977), p. 140.</ref> In the introduction to ''[[The Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border]]'' (1802) the romantic poet and historical novelist [[Walter Scott]] argued a need to 'remove obvious corruptions' in order to attempt to restore a supposed original. For Scott, the process of multiple recitations 'incurs the risk of impertinent interpolations from the conceit of one rehearser, unintelligible blunders from the stupidity of another, and omissions equally to be regretted, from the want of memory of a third.' Similarly, John Robert Moore noted 'a natural tendency to oblivescence'.<ref>\"The Influence of transmission on the English Ballads\", ''Modern Language Review'' 11 (1916), p. 387.</ref> According to Scott, transcribed ballads often have a 'flatness and insipidity' compared to their oral counterparts.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\n==Classification==\n[[File:Illustration to the ballad Young Beckie from \"Some British Ballads\".jpg|right|thumb|Illustration by [[Arthur Rackham]] to ''[[Young Bekie]].'']] European Ballads have been generally classified into three major groups: traditional, broadside and literary. In America a distinction is drawn between ballads that are versions of European, particularly British and Irish songs, and 'Native American ballads', developed without reference to earlier songs. A further development was the evolution of the blues ballad, which mixed the genre with Afro-American music. For the late 19th century the music publishing industry found a market for what are often termed sentimental ballads, and these are the origin of the modern use of the term 'ballad' to mean a slow love song.\n\n===Traditional ballads===\n{{See also|Child Ballads}}\nThe traditional, classical or popular (meaning of the people) ballad has been seen as beginning with the wandering [[minstrels]] of late medieval Europe.<ref name=Houseman1952/> From the end of the 15th century there are printed ballads that suggest a rich tradition of popular music. A reference in [[William Langland]]'s ''[[Piers Plowman]]'' indicates that ballads about [[Robin Hood]] were being sung from at least the late 14th century and the oldest detailed material is [[Wynkyn de Worde|Wynkyn de Worde's]] collection of Robin Hood ballads printed about 1495.<ref name=Sweers2005>B. Sweers, ''Electric Folk: The Changing Face of English Traditional Music'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), p. 45.</ref>\n\nEarly collections of English ballads were made by [[Samuel Pepys]] (1633\u20131703) and in the [[Roxburghe Ballads]] collected by [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|Robert Harley]], 1st (1784), which paralleled the work in Scotland by [[Walter Scott]] and [[Robert Burns]].<ref name=Sweers2005/> Inspired by his reading as a teenager of ''[[Reliques of Ancient English Poetry]]'' by [[Thomas Percy (bishop of Dromore)|Thomas Percy]], Scott began collecting ballads while he attended Edinburgh University in the 1790s. He published his research from 1802 to 1803 in a three-volume work, ''[[The Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border]]''. Burns collaborated with [[James Johnson (engraver)|James Johnson]] on the multi-volume ''[[Scots Musical Museum]]'', a miscellany of folk songs and poetry with original work by Burns. Around the same time, he worked with [[George Thomson (musician)|George Thompson]] on ''[[A Select Collection of Original Scottish Airs for the Voice]]''.<ref name=\"Scott\">{{cite book|last=Gregory|first=E.

Bold, 1979 p. 5\"/> They attempted to record and classify all the known ballads and variants in their chosen regions. Since Child died before writing a commentary on his work it is uncertain exactly how and why he differentiated the 305 ballads printed that would be published as ''[[The English and Scottish Popular Ballads]]''.<ref>T. A. Green, ''Folklore: An Encyclopedia of Beliefs, Customs, Tales, Music, and Art'' (ABC-CLIO, 1997), p. 352.</ref> There have been many different and contradictory attempts to classify traditional ballads by theme, but commonly identified types are the religious, supernatural, tragic, love ballads, historic, legendary and humorous.<ref name=Houseman1952/> The traditional form and content of the ballad were modified to form the basis for twenty-three bawdy pornographic ballads that appeared in the underground Victorian magazine ''[[The Pearl (magazine)|The Pearl]]'', which ran for eighteen issues between 1879 and 1880. Unlike the traditional ballad, these obscene ballads aggressively mocked sentimental nostalgia and local lore.<ref>Thomas J.

They were generally printed on one side of a medium to large sheet of poor quality paper. In the first half of the 17th century, they were printed in black-letter or gothic type and included multiple, eye-catching illustrations, a popular tune title, as well as an alluring poem.<ref>E.

Capp, 'Popular literature', in B. Reay, ed., ''Popular Culture in Seventeenth-Century England'' (Routledge, 1985), p. 204.</ref>\n\n===Literary ballads===\nLiterary or lyrical ballads grew out of an increasing interest in the ballad form among social elites and intellectuals, particularly in the [[Romantic movement]] from the later 18th century. Respected literary figures [[Robert Burns]] and [[Walter Scott]] in Scotland collected and wrote their own ballads. Similarly in England [[William Wordsworth]] and [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] produced a collection of ''[[Lyrical Ballads]]'' in 1798 that included Coleridge's ''[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]''. Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Keats were attracted to the simple and natural style of these folk ballads and tried to imitate it.<ref>\"Popular Ballads\", ''The Broadview Anthology of British Literature'', p. 610.</ref> At the same time in Germany [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] cooperated with [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]] on a series of ballads, some of which were later set to music by [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]].<ref>J. R. Williams, ''The Life of Goethe'' (Blackwell Publishing, 2001), pp. 106-8.</ref> Later important examples of the poetic form included Rudyard Kipling's \"[[Barrack-Room Ballads]]\" (1892-6) and [[Oscar Wilde]]'s ''[[The Ballad of Reading Gaol]]'' (1897).<ref>S. Ledger, S. McCracken, ''Cultural Politics at the Fin de Si\u00e8cle'' (Cambridge University Press, 1995), p. 152.</ref> Victorian poet [[Christina Rossetti]] used ballad forms to explore spiritual and moral issues and to discuss the stereotypical treatment and representation of men and women's roles in society.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\n==Ballad operas==\n{{Main article|Ballad opera}}\n[[File:William Hogarth 016.jpg|thumb|200px|Painting based on ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]'', Act III Scene 2, [[William Hogarth]], c. 1728]]\nIn the 18th century ballad operas developed as a form of [[England|English]] [[stage play|stage entertainment]], partly in opposition to the Italian domination of the London operatic scene.<ref>M. Lubbock, ''The Complete Book of Light Opera'' (New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts, 1962) pp. 467-68.</ref> It consisted of racy and often [[Satire|satirical]] spoken (English) dialogue, interspersed with songs that are deliberately kept very short to minimize disruptions to the flow of the story. Rather than the more aristocratic themes and music of the Italian opera, the ballad operas were set to the music of popular folk songs and dealt with lower-class characters.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/50485/ballad-opera \"Ballad opera\"], ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'', retrieved 7 April 2015.</ref> Subject matter involved the lower, often criminal, orders, and typically showed a suspension (or inversion) of the high moral values of the Italian opera of the period. The first, most important and successful was ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]'' of 1728, with a libretto by [[John Gay]] and music arranged by [[John Christopher Pepusch]], both of whom probably influenced by [[Paris]] ian vaudeville and the burlesques and musical plays of [[Thomas d'Urfey]] (1653\u20131723), a number of whose collected ballads they used in their work.<ref>F. Kidson, ''The Beggar's Opera: Its Predecessors and Successors'' (Cambridge University Press, 1969), p. 71.</ref> Gay produced further works in this style, including a sequel under the title ''Polly''. [[Henry Fielding]], [[Colley Cibber]], Arne, Dibdin, Arnold, Shield, Jackson of Exeter, Hook and many others produced ballad operas that enjoyed great popularity.<ref>M. Lubbock, ''The Complete Book of Light Opera'' (New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts, 1962), pp. 467-68.</ref> Ballad opera was attempted in America and Prussia. Later it moved into a more pastoral form, like [[Isaac Bickerstaffe|Isaac Bickerstaffe's]] ''Love in a Village'' (1763) and [[William Shield|Shield's]] ''Rosina'' (1781), using more original music that imitated, rather than reproduced, existing ballads. Although the form declined in popularity towards the end of the 18th century its influence can be seen in light operas like that of [[Gilbert and Sullivan|Gilbert and Sullivan's]] early works like ''[[The Sorcerer]]'' as well as in the modern musical.<ref>G. Wren, ''A Most Ingenious Paradox: The Art of Gilbert and Sullivan'' (Oxford University Press, 2006), p. 41.</ref> In the 20th century, one of the most influential plays, [[Kurt Weill]] and [[Bertolt Brecht|Bertolt Brecht's]] (1928) ''[[The Threepenny Opera]]'' was a reworking of ''The Beggar's Opera'', setting a similar story with the same characters, and containing much of the same satirical bite, but only using one tune from the original.<ref>K. Lawrence, ''Decolonizing Tradition: New Views of Twentieth-century \"British\" Literary Canons'' (University of Illinois Press, 1992), p. 30.</ref> The term ballad opera has also been used to describe musicals using folk music, such as ''The Martins and the Coys'' in 1944, and [[Peter Bellamy|Peter Bellamy's]] ''The Transports'' in 1977.<ref>A.

Gruchow, ''The North Star State: A Minnesota History Reader'', (Minnesota Historical Society Press, 2002), p. 461.</ref> The satiric elements of ballad opera can be seen in some modern musicals such as ''[[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]]'' and ''[[Cabaret (musical)|Cabaret]]''.<ref>L.

Blues ballads tend to deal with active protagonists, often anti-heroes, resisting adversity and authority, but frequently lacking a strong narrative and emphasising character instead.<ref name=Cohen2005/> They were often accompanied by banjo and guitar which followed [[the blues]] musical format.<ref name=\"A.

The rhyming songs, [[poems]] and tales written in the form of ballads often relate to the itinerant and rebellious spirit of Australia in [[The Bush]], and the authors and performers are often referred to as bush bards.<ref name=\"abc.net.au\">Kerry O'Brien December 10, 2003 7:30 Report, [http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2003/s1007523.htm abc.net.au]</ref> The 19th century was the golden age of bush ballads. Several collectors have catalogued the songs including [[John Meredith (folklorist)|John Meredith]] whose recording in the 1950s became the basis of the collection in the [[National Library of Australia]].<ref name=\"abc.net.au\"/> The songs tell personal stories of life in the wide open country of Australia. Typical subjects include mining, raising and droving cattle, [[sheep shearing]], wanderings, war stories, the [[1891 Australian shearers' strike]], class conflicts between the landless working class and the [[Squatting (pastoral)|squatters]] (landowners), and outlaws such as [[Ned Kelly]], as well as love interests and more modern fare such as [[Truck driver|trucking]].<ref>G.

They were generally sentimental, narrative, strophic songs published separately or as part of an [[opera]] (descendants perhaps of [[broadside (music)|broadside ballads]], but with [[sheet music|printed music]], and usually newly composed). Such songs include \"Little Rosewood Casket\" (1870), \"[[After the Ball (song)|After the Ball]]\" (1892) and \"[[Danny Boy]]\".<ref name=Cohen2005/> The association with sentimentality led to the term \"ballad\" being used for slow [[love song]]s from the 1950s onwards.

Writer [[Richard Meltzer]] also provided the band with lyrics from their early days up through their most recent studio album. Pearlman also gave stage names to each of the band members (Jesse Python for Eric Bloom, Andy Panda for Andy Winters, Prince Omega for Albert Bouchard, La Verne for Allen Lanier) but only Buck Dharma kept his.<ref>{{cite book |last=Popoff |first=Martin |title=Blue Oyster Cult, Secrets Revealed! |publisher=Metal Blade Records, Inc. |isbn=0-9752807-0-8 |page=9}}</ref> The band recorded an album's worth of material for [[Elektra Records]] in 1968. When Braunstein departed in early 1969, Elektra shelved the album.\n\n[[Eric Bloom]] got hired by the band as their [[acoustical engineering|acoustic engineer]] and eventually became lead singer, replacing Braunstein, through a series of three unlikely coincidences, one in which Lanier decided to join Bloom on a drive to an [[upstate New York|upstate]] gig where he spent the night with Bloom's old college bandmates and got to hear old tapes of Bloom's talent as lead vocalist.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR1NpyxowP4 \"Three Strokes of Fate\"], Living Legends Music interview (posted to YouTube on Nov 4, 2008) where Bloom explains three highly unlikely events that happened in which he ended up joining the band and becoming their lead singer:<br>1) Being their amp salesperson at Sam Ash,<br>2) Telling one person where he as staying in NYC and getting the soundboard job offer,<br>3) Upstate roadtrip where Lanier decided to join and got to hear Bloom's old band tapes as lead vocalist.</ref>  Because of this, Bloom was offered the job of lead singer for Soft White Underbelly. However, a bad review of a 1969 Fillmore East show caused Pearlman to change the name of the band&nbsp;\u2013 first to Oaxaca, then to the Stalk-Forrest Group. The band recorded yet another album's worth of material for Elektra, but only one single (\"What Is Quicksand?\" b/w \"Arthur Comics\") was released (and only in a promo edition of 300 copies) on [[Elektra Records]] (this album was eventually released, with additional outtakes, by Rhino Handmade Records as ''[[St. Cecilia: The Elektra Recordings]]'' in 2001). The album featured Bloom as their main lead singer, but Roeser also sang lead on a few songs, a pattern of sharing lead vocals that has continued throughout the band's career.\n\nAfter a few more temporary band names, including the Santos Sisters, the band settled on Blue \u00d6yster Cult in 1971 (see [[#Band name and logo|below]] for its origin).\n\nNew York City producer/composer and jingle writer [[David Lucas (composer)|David Lucas]] saw the band perform and took them into his Warehouse Recording Studio and produced four demos, with which Pearlman was able to get the renamed band another audition with [[Columbia Records]]. [[Clive Davis]] liked what he heard, and signed the band to the label.

The album featured the songs \"[[Cities on Flame with Rock and Roll]]\", \"Stairway to the Stars\" and \"Then Came the Last Days of May\". By this time, the band's sound had become more oriented toward hard rock, but songs like \"She's As Beautiful As a Foot\" and \"Redeemed\" also showed a strong element of the band's psychedelic roots. All of the band members except for Allen Lanier sang lead, a pattern that would continue on many subsequent albums, although lead singer Eric Bloom sang the majority of the songs. The album sold well, and Blue \u00d6yster Cult toured with artists such as [[The Byrds]], [[Mahavishnu Orchestra]] and [[Alice Cooper]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Perry |first=Shawn |url=http://www.vintagerock.com/ebloom_interview.aspx |title=The Eric Bloom Interview |publisher=Vintagerock.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070720122423/http://www.vintagerock.com/ebloom_interview.aspx |archivedate=2007-07-20 }}</ref> During the touring process, the band's sound became heavier and more direct.\n\nTheir next album ''[[Tyranny and Mutation]]'', released in 1973, was written while the band was on tour for their first LP. It contained songs such as \"The Red and the Black\" (an ode to the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] and a rewrite of \"I'm On the Lamb But I Ain't No Sheep\" from the debut album), \"Hot Rails to Hell\" and \"Baby Ice Dog\", the first of the band's many collaborations with [[Patti Smith]]. It featured a harder-rocking approach than before, though the band's songs were also growing more complex. The album outsold its predecessor, a trend that would continue with their next few albums.\n\nThe band's third album, ''[[Secret Treaties]]'' (1974) received positive reviews, featuring songs such as \"Career of Evil\" (co-written by Patti Smith), \"Dominance and Submission\" and \"[[Astronomy (song)|Astronomy]]\". As a result of constant touring, the band was now capable of headlining arenas. The album continued the trend of growing sales, and would eventually go gold.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&se=blue+oyster+cult+secret+treaties#search_section|title=Gold & Platinum - RIAA|work=RIAA|access-date=2018-03-13|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n{{cns|As the three albums during this formative period all had black-and-white covers, the period of their career has been dubbed the 'black and white years' by fans and critics.|date=June 2018}}\n\n===Commercial success (1975\u201381)===\nThe band's first live album ''[[On Your Feet or on Your Knees]]'' (1975) achieved greater success and went gold. Its success gave the band more time to work on a follow-up. The band members were able to purchase home recording units to record demos for their next album.\n\nTheir next studio album, ''[[Agents of Fortune]]'' (1976), was their first to go platinum and was again produced by David Lucas. It contained the hit single \"[[(Don't Fear) The Reaper]]\", which reached number 12 on the Billboard charts and has become a classic of the heavy rock genre. Other major songs on the album were \"(This Ain't) The Summer of Love\", \"E.T.I. (Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence)\" and \"The Revenge of Vera Gemini\". Having recorded demos of the songs at home before recording the album, the band's songwriting process had become more individual, with none of the songs featuring the collaborative writing between the band members that had been common on their earlier albums.  Although the album still featured their trademark hard rock with sinister lyrics, the songs had become more conventional in structure, and the production was more polished.  For the first and only time, the album featured lead vocals from all five band members, with Allen Lanier singing lead on the song ''True Confessions.'' With Albert Bouchard singing lead on three songs and Joe Bouchard and Donald Roeser singing lead on one each, Eric Bloom ended up taking the lead on only four of the album's ten songs.\n\nFor the tour, the band added lasers to their light show, for which they became known. They were among the first acts to use lasers in performance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blueoystercult.com/History/history6.html|publisher=Blue Oyster Cult.com|title=The History of B\u00d6C|accessdate=2008-09-14}}</ref>\n\nTheir next album, ''[[Spectres (album)|Spectres]]'' (1977), had the FM radio hit \"[[Godzilla (song)|Godzilla]]\", and would become the one of the band's better-selling albums, with other well-known songs like \"I Love The Night\" and \"Goin' Through The Motions.\" However, its sales were not as strong as those for the previous album, going gold but not platinum, becoming their first album to sell less than its predecessor. It featured even more polished production, and continued the trend of the lead vocals extensively shared between members, although Allen Lanier did not sing lead. As with the previous album, Eric Bloom sang lead on fewer than half the songs.\n\nThe band then released another live album, ''[[Some Enchanted Evening (Blue \u00d6yster Cult album)|Some Enchanted Evening]]'' (1978). Though it was intended as another double-live album in the vein of ''On Your Feet or on Your Knees'', Columbia insisted that it be edited down to single-album length. It was a resounding commercial success, becoming Blue \u00d6yster Cult's most popular album and eventually selling over 2 million copies. It also revealed that while the band's studio work was becoming increasingly well-produced, they were still very much a hard rock band on stage.\n\nIt was followed by the studio album ''[[Mirrors (Blue \u00d6yster Cult album)|Mirrors]]'' (1979). For ''Mirrors'', instead of working with previous producers Sandy Pearlman (who instead went on to manage [[Black Sabbath]]) and Murray Krugman, Blue \u00d6yster Cult chose [[Tom Werman]], who had worked with acts such as [[Cheap Trick]] and [[Ted Nugent]]. It featured the band's glossiest production to date. It also gave Roeser, the lead vocalist on the band's biggest hits, bigger prominence as a vocalist, singing lead on four of the nine songs.  However, the resulting album sales were disappointing.<ref>https://worldhistoryproject.org/1979/6/blue-oyster-cult-releases-mirrors</ref>\n\nPearlman's association with Black Sabbath led to Sabbath's ''[[Heaven and Hell (Black Sabbath album)|Heaven and Hell]]'' producer [[Martin Birch]] being hired for the next Blue \u00d6yster Cult record. The album found the band returning to their hard-rock roots, and although both of the Bouchard brothers and guitarist Roeser all got lead vocal turns, it was the band's first album since ''Secret Treaties'' to feature nominal lead singer Eric Bloom singing the majority of the tracks. The result was positive, with ''[[Cult\u00f6saurus Erectus]]'' (1980) receiving good reviews. The album went to number 12 in the United Kingdom, but did not do as well in the United States. The song \"Black Blade\", which was written by Bloom with lyrics by science fiction and fantasy author [[Michael Moorcock]], is a kind of retelling of Moorcock's epic [[Elric of Melnibon\u00e9]] saga. The band also did a co-headlining tour with Black Sabbath in support of the album, calling the tour \"[[Black and Blue (video)|Black and Blue]]\".\n\nBirch produced the band's next album as well, ''[[Fire of Unknown Origin]]'' (1981). The biggest hit on this album was the Top 40 hit \"[[Burnin' for You]]\", a song Roeser had written with a [[Richard Meltzer]] lyric. He had intended to use it on his solo album, ''[[Flat Out (Buck Dharma album)|Flat Out]]'' (1982), but he was convinced to use it on the Blue \u00d6yster Cult album instead. The revival of the band's heavier sound continued, albeit with fairly heavy use of synthesizers and some noticeable [[New wave music|New Wave]] influence on a few tracks. It contained other fan favorites such as \"Joan Crawford\" (inspired by the book and film ''[[Mommie Dearest]]'') and \"[[Veteran of the Psychic Wars]]\", another song co-written by Moorcock. Several of the songs had been written for the animated film ''[[Heavy Metal (film)|Heavy Metal]]'', but only \"Veteran of the Psychic Wars\" (which had not been written for ''Heavy Metal'') was actually used in the movie. The album marked a strong commercial resurgence for the band and achieved gold status, their first studio album since ''Spectres'' to do so.\n\nDuring the tour for ''Fire of Unknown Origin'', Albert Bouchard had a falling out with the others and left the band, and Rick Downey (formerly the band's lighting designer) replaced him on drums. This marked the end of the band's original and best-known lineup.\n\n===Decline and fall (1982\u201387)===\nAfter leaving the band, Albert Bouchard spent five years working on a solo album based on Sandy Pearlman's poem \"Imaginos\". Blue \u00d6yster Cult also released a third live album ''[[Extraterrestrial Live]]''.\n\nThe band then went to the studio for the next album, ''[[The Rev\u00f6lution by Night]]'' (1983), with [[Bruce Fairbairn]] as producer. After two albums of a return to a harder rocking sound, the band adopted a more radio-friendly, AOR-oriented sound with Fairbairn providing a 1980's-style production. This approach met with some success, especially on its highest-charting single, Roeser's \"Shooting Shark\", co-written by Patti Smith and featuring [[Randy Jackson]] on bass, which reached number 83 on the charts. Bloom's \"Take Me Away\" also achieved some FM radio play. However, the album did not match the sales of its predecessor, failed to go gold, and marked the beginning of the band's second commercial decline. After touring for ''Rev\u00f6lution'', Rick Downey left, leaving Blue \u00d6yster Cult without a drummer.\n\nThe band re-united with Albert Bouchard for a California tour in February 1985, infamously known as the \"Albert Returns\" Tour. This arrangement was only temporary, and caused more tensions between the band and Bouchard, as he had thought he would be staying on permanently, which was not the case. The band had only intended to use him as a last-minute fill-in until another drummer could come on board, which resulted in Bouchard's leaving after the tour. Allen Lanier also quit the band shortly thereafter, leaving the band without a keyboardist and with only three remaining original members. This incarnation of the band would sometimes be referred to as '3\u00d6C' by fans, a pun on the number of original members left.\n\nBlue \u00d6yster Cult hired drummer Jimmy Wilcox and keyboardist Tommy Zvoncheck to finish the album ''[[Club Ninja]]'', which was poorly received, with only \"Dancing In the Ruins\"\u2014one of several songs on the record written entirely by outside songwriters\u2014enjoying minimal success on radio and [[MTV]]. The best-known original on the album is \"Perfect Water\" written by Dharma and [[Jim Carroll]] (noted author of ''[[The Basketball Diaries]]''). While the band members have generally been disparaging about the album in retrospect, Joe Bouchard has stated that \"Perfect Water\" is \"perfect genius.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Blue \u00d6yster Cult: Secrets Revealed!|last1=Popoff|first1=Martin|date=March 2009|publisher=Power Chord Press|isbn=0-9752807-0-8|edition=2|location=[[Toronto]], [[Canada]]|page=218|chapter=Club Ninja|authorlink1=Martin Popoff}}<!--| accessdate = 2012-03-17 --></ref>\n\nThe band toured in Germany, after which bassist Bouchard left, leaving only two members of the classic lineup, Eric Bloom and Donald Roeser\u2014some referred to the band as \"Two \u00d6yster Cult\" during this period. Jon Rogers was hired to replace Joe, and this version of the band finished out the 1986 tour. After the tour wound up that year, the band took a temporary break from recording and touring.[[File:Blue \u00d6yster Cult Sweden Rock 2008.jpg|thumb|Blue \u00d6yster Cult performing at the [[Sweden Rock Festival]], 2008.]] When Blue \u00d6yster Cult received an offer to tour in Greece in the early summer of 1987, the band reformed. Allen Lanier had agreed to rejoin, so the new line-up now featured three founding members, along with Jon Rogers returning on bass, and Ron Riddle as the band's newest drummer.\n\n[[Columbia Records]] was not interested in releasing the ''[[Imaginos]]'' project as an Albert Bouchard solo album, so it was arranged for it to be released in 1988 by Columbia as a Blue \u00d6yster Cult album, with some new lead vocal overdubs from Bloom and Roeser and lead guitar overdubs from Roeser. These replaced most of Albert Bouchard's lead vocals, as well as many lead guitar parts that had been recorded by session musicians. Joe Bouchard and Allen Lanier had earlier contributed some minor keyboard and backing vocal parts to the album, allowing all 5 original members to be credited. The album did not sell well (despite a positive review in ''Rolling Stone'' magazine), and though the then-current Blue \u00d6yster Cult lineup (minus both Bouchard brothers) did tour to promote ''Imaginos'', promotion by the label was virtually non-existent. When Columbia Records' parent company CBS Records was purchased by [[Sony]] and became [[Sony Music Entertainment]], Blue \u00d6yster Cult were dropped from the label.\n\n=== 1990s and early 2000s ===\nThe band spent the next 11 years touring without releasing an album of new material, though they did contribute two new songs to the ''[[Bad Channels]]'' movie soundtrack, released in 1992, and also released an album of re-recorded songs from the band's original lineup called ''[[Cult Classic]]'' in 1994. During these years, while the three original members remained constant, there were several changes in the band's rhythm section. Riddle quit in 1991 and was followed by a series of other drummers including\n[[Chuck Burgi]] (1991\u20131992, 1992\u20131995, 1996\u20131997), [[John Miceli]] (1992, 1995), John O'Reilly (1995\u20131996) and [[Bobby Rondinelli]] (1997\u20132004). As for the bass position, Rogers left in 1995, and was replaced by Danny Miranda.\n\n[[File:Blue \u00d6yster Cult 2012 Edmonton 223b.JPG|thumb|right|Blue \u00d6yster Cult performs in [[Edmonton|Edmonton, Alberta]], Canada on August 18, 2012.]]\nIn the late 1990s, Blue \u00d6yster Cult secured a recording contract with CMC Records (later purchased by [[Sanctuary Records]]), and continued to tour frequently. Two studio albums were released, ''[[Heaven Forbid]]'' (1998) and ''[[Curse of the Hidden Mirror]]'' (2001). Both albums featured songs co-written by cyberpunk/horror novelist [[John Shirley]]. The first mostly featured Miranda on bass and Burgi on drums, though a few tracks feature earliest bassist Jon Rogers and one track features Rondinelli on drums, who had joined the band near the end of the recording. ''Curse of the Hidden Mirror'' features Miranda and Rondinelli as the rhythm section, and the pair contributed to the songwriting as well. Neither album sold well.\n\nAnother live record, ''[[A Long Day's Night]]'' and DVD (same title), followed in 2002, both drawn from one concert in Chicago. This album also featured the Bloom, Roeser, Lainer, Miranda, Rondinelli lineup.\n\nAlthough the band's lineup had remained stable from 1997 to 2004, they began to experience personnel changes again in 2004. Rondinelli left in 2004, and was replaced by Jules Radino. Miranda left during the same year and ended up as the bassist for [[Queen + Paul Rodgers]]. He was replaced by Richie Castellano, who would also take occasional turns as a lead vocalist onstage.\n\nIn 2001, Sony/Columbia's reissue arm, [[Legacy Records]] issued expanded versions of the first four Blue \u00d6yster Cult studio albums, including some previously unreleased demos and outtakes from album sessions, live recordings (from the ''Live 72'' EP), and post-St. Cecilia tunes from the Stalk-Forrest Group era.\n\n[[File:Allenlanier.JPG|right|thumb|Blue \u00d6yster Cult live in 2006]]\n\n=== Recent events ===\nAllen Lanier retired from live performances in 2007 after not appearing with the band since late 2006. Castellano switched to rhythm guitar and keyboards (Castellano also filled in on lead guitar and vocals for an ailing Buck Dharma in two shows in 2005), and the position of bassist was taken up by [[Rudy Sarzo]] (previously a member of [[Quiet Riot]], [[Whitesnake]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]] and [[Dio (band)|Dio]]), with the band employing Danny Miranda and Jon Rogers as guest bassists to fill in when Sarzo was unavailable. Sarzo then joined as an official member of the band, although Rogers continued to occasionally fill in when Sarzo was busy.\n\nIn February 2007, the Sony Legacy remaster series continued, releasing expanded versions of studio album ''[[Spectres (album)|Spectres]]'' and live album ''[[Some Enchanted Evening (Blue \u00d6yster Cult album)|Some Enchanted Evening]]''.\n\nIn December 2008, B\u00d6C management announced that Roeser had fallen down a staircase in his [[Florida]] home and injured his shoulder. As a result, several tour dates in December 2008 and January 2009 were canceled or postponed. The band returned to touring by the fall of 2009.\n\nIn June 2012, the band announced that bassist [[Rudy Sarzo]] was leaving the band and was being replaced by former [[Utopia (American band)|Utopia]] bassist [[Kasim Sulton]].\n\nIn August of the same year, it was announced that Sony Legacy would be releasing a 17-disc boxed set entitled ''The Complete Columbia Albums Collection'' on October 30, 2012. The set includes the first round of the remastered series plus the long-awaited remastered versions of; ''On Your Feet or on Your Knees'' (1975), ''[[Mirrors (Blue \u00d6yster Cult album)|Mirrors]]'', ''[[Cult\u00f6saurus Erectus]]'', ''[[Fire Of Unknown Origin]]'', ''[[Extraterrestrial Live]]'', ''[[The Rev\u00f6lution by Night]]'', ''[[Club Ninja]]'' and ''[[Imaginos]]''. Also exclusive to this set are two discs of rare and unreleased B-sides, demos and radio broadcasts.\n\nAlso in 2012, celebrating the 40th anniversary of Blue \u00d6yster Cult, the then-current incarnation of the band reunited for the first time in 25 years with other original members Joe and Albert Bouchard and Allan Lanier as guests for a special event in New York.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/original-blue-oyster-cult-lineup-reunites-new-york-city/|title=Original Blue Oyster Cult Lineup Reunites in New York City|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|language=en|access-date=2018-03-13}}</ref>\n\nFounding keyboardist/guitarist Allen Lanier died of [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] on August 14, 2013.<ref>[http://www.noise11.com/news/allen-lanier-of-blue-oyster-cult-dead-at-66-20130815 Allen Lanier of Blue Oyster Cult Dead At 66 | News | Music News].

The shows featured songs from ''Agents of Fortune'' that had either not been played live before (\"True Confessions\", \"The Revenge of Vera Gemini\", \"Sinful Love\", \"Tenderloin\", \"Debbie Denise\"), songs that had not been played since the album's debut tour (\"Morning Final\"), and songs that were either no longer or never were played frequently (\"This Ain't the Summer of Love\", \"Tattoo Vampire\"), as well as the fan favorite \"Five Guitars\", which had not been played since Albert initially left the band in 1981. Albert played in the following songs at the show: \"The Revenge of Vera Gemini\" (vocals, guitar), \"Sinful Love\" (vocals, guitar), \"Tattoo Vampire\" (guitar), \"Morning Final\" (guitar), \"Tenderloin\" (cymbals), \"Debbie Denise\" (vocals, acoustic guitar), \"Cities on Flame with Rock and Roll\" (vocals, drums), and \"Five Guitars\" (guitar).<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://getreadytorock.me.uk/blog/2016/07/gig-review-blue-oyster-cult-kentish-town-forum-29-july-2016/|title=Gig review: BLUE OYSTER CULT \u2013 Kentish Town Forum, London, 29 July 2016|work=Get Ready to ROCK!

The southern section, extending down from the Winter Garden, which is located in Brookfield Place, contains residential apartment buildings such as Gateway Plaza and the Rector Place apartment buildings. In this section lies the majority of Battery Park City's residential areas, in three sections: Gateway Plaza, a high-rise building complex; the \"Rector Place Residential Neighborhood\"; and the\" Battery Place Residential Neighborhood\". These subsections contain most of the area's residential buildings, along with [[park]] space, [[supermarket]]s, [[restaurant]]s, and [[movie theater]]s. Construction of residential buildings began north of the World Financial Center in the late 1990s, and completion of the final lots took place in early 2011.

That plan became complicated when Governor [[Nelson Rockefeller]] announced his desire to redevelop a part of the area as a separate project. The various groups reached a compromise, and in 1966 the governor unveiled the proposal for what would become Battery Park City. The creation of architect [[Wallace K. Harrison]], the proposal called for a 'comprehensive community' consisting of housing, social infrastructure and light industry. The landscaping of the park space and later the Winter Garden was designed by [[M.

This test, called the ''whiff test'', is performed by adding a small amount of [[potassium hydroxide]] to a [[microscopic slide]] containing the vaginal discharge. A characteristic [[fishy odor]] is considered a positive whiff test and is suggestive of bacterial vaginosis.\n* Loss of [[acidity]]. To control bacterial growth, the vagina is normally slightly acidic with a [[pH]] of 3.8\u20134.2. A swab of the discharge is put onto [[litmus paper]] to check its acidity. A pH greater than 4.5 is considered alkaline and is suggestive of bacterial vaginosis.\n* The presence of ''[[clue cell]]s'' on wet mount. Similar to the whiff test, the test for clue cells is performed by placing a drop of [[sodium chloride]] solution on a slide containing vaginal discharge. If present, clue cells can be visualized under a microscope. They are so-named because they give a clue to the reason behind the discharge. These are [[epithelial]] cells that are coated with bacteria.\n\nTwo positive results in addition to the discharge itself are enough to diagnose BV.

An immigrant from [[Ukraine]], Marie Selig attended college, a rare accomplishment for a woman in the early 20th century, and became a school teacher. When Selig was only three, Marie began taking him and his older brother, Jerry, to [[Borchert Field]], where the minor league [[Milwaukee Brewers (minor league baseball team)|Milwaukee Brewers]] played. When the [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston Braves]] relocated to Milwaukee in 1953, Selig switched allegiances, and eventually became the team's largest public stockholder. Selig was devastated when he learned that the Braves were going to leave Milwaukee in favor of [[Atlanta]]. In 1965, when the Braves left Milwaukee, he divested his stock in the team.  As a youngster, Selig's favorite player was [[Hersh Martin|Hershel Martin]].\n\n== Milwaukee Brewers owner ==\n{{see also|Milwaukee Brewers}}\n\nAs a minority owner of the [[Milwaukee Braves (1953\u201365)|Milwaukee Braves]], Selig founded the organization '''''Teams, Inc.''''', in an attempt to prevent the majority owners (based out of Chicago) from moving the club to a larger television market. This was challenged legally on the basis that no prior team relocations (in the modern era) left a city without a team. Prior movements had all originated in cities which were home to at least two teams. When his quest to keep the team in Milwaukee finally failed after the [[1965 in baseball|1965 season]], he changed the group's name to Milwaukee Brewers Baseball Club, Inc., after the [[Milwaukee Brewers (minor league baseball team)|minor league baseball team]] he grew up watching, and devoted himself to returning Major League Baseball to Milwaukee.\n\nSelig arranged for major league games to be played at [[Milwaukee County Stadium]]. The first, a pre-season match-up between the [[Chicago White Sox]] and [[Minnesota Twins]], drew more than 51,000 spectators. Selig followed this up by hosting nine White Sox regular-season games in 1968 and eleven in 1969. One of the games played in Milwaukee that year was against the expansion [[Seattle Pilots]], the team that would become the Brewers. Those Milwaukee \"home\" games were phenomenally successful, with the handful of games accounting for about ''one-third'' of total White Sox home attendance.\n\nTo satisfy that fan base, Selig decided to purchase the White Sox (with the intention of moving them to Milwaukee) in 1969. He entered into an agreement to buy the club, but the [[American League]] vetoed the sale, preferring to keep an American League team in Chicago, which at the time was still America's second largest city. Selig turned his attention to other franchises.\n\n[[File:Bud Selig statue.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Selig Monument]]'' outside of [[Miller Park (Milwaukee)|Miller Park]]]]\n\nIn 1970, he purchased the bankrupt Seattle Pilots franchise, moving them to his hometown and officially renaming the team the ''Brewers''.\n\nDuring Selig's tenure as club president, the Brewers participated in postseason play in 1981, when the team finished first in the American League East during the second half of the season, and in 1982, when the team made it to the [[1982 World Series|World Series]], under the leadership of future [[Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Famers]] [[Robin Yount]] and [[Paul Molitor]]. Under Selig's watch, the Brewers also won seven Organization of the Year awards. Selig was part of the owners' [[Baseball collusion#1985\u20131987|collusion]] in 1985\u20131987, resulting in the owners paying US$280 million in damages to the players.\n\nUpon his assumption of the commissioner's role, Selig transferred his ownership interest in the Brewers to his daughter [[Wendy Selig-Prieb]] in order to remove any technical conflicts of interest, though it was widely presumed he maintained some hand in team operations. Although the team has been sold to [[Los Angeles]] investor [[Mark Attanasio]], questions remain regarding Selig's past involvement. Selig's defenders point to the poor management of the team after Selig-Prieb took control as proof that Selig was not working behind the scenes.\n\nSelig was elected to the [[Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame]] in 2001.\n\nOn August 24, 2010, a statue of Selig, the ''[[Selig Monument]]'', commissioned by Brewers owner Mark Attanasio and designed by artist Brian Maughan, was unveiled outside Miller Park in Milwaukee.\n\n== Acting Commissioner (1992\u20131998) ==\n\nSelig became an increasingly vocal opponent of Commissioner [[Fay Vincent]], and soon became the leader of a group of owners seeking his removal. Selig has never stated that the owners [[Baseball collusion|colluded]], while Vincent has:\n\n{{quote|The [[Major League Baseball Players Association|Union]] basically doesn't trust the ownership because [[Baseball collusion|collusion]] was a US$280 million theft by Selig and [[Jerry Reinsdorf]] of that money from the players. I mean, they rigged the signing of [[free agent]]s. They got caught. They paid $280 million to the players. And I think that's polluted labor relations in baseball ever since it happened. I think it's the reason [[MLBPA]] executive director [[Donald Fehr]] has no trust in Selig.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bizofbaseball.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1173&Itemid=81 |title=Interview with Fay Vincent |publisher=Bizofbaseball.com |date=November 9, 2005 |accessdate=October 17, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713054852/http://www.bizofbaseball.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1173&Itemid=81 |archivedate=July 13, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>|Fay Vincent}}\n\nFollowing an 18-9 [[no-confidence vote]], Vincent resigned. Selig had by this time become chairman of the '''Executive Council of Major League Baseball''', and as such became [[de facto]] acting commissioner.\n\nHis first major act was to institute the [[MLB Wild Card|Wild Card]] and divisional playoff play, which has created much controversy amongst baseball fans. Those against the Wild Card see it as diminishing the importance of the [[pennant race]] and the regular season, with the true race often being for second rather than first place, while those in favor of it view it as an opportunity for teams to have a shot at the playoffs even when they have no chance of a first-place finish in their division, thus maintaining fan interest later in the season.\n\nSelig suspended [[Cincinnati Reds]] owner [[Marge Schott]] for a year in 1993 for repeated racially insensitive and prejudicial remarks and actions. The same year, [[New York Yankees]] owner [[George Steinbrenner]] was reinstated from a lifelong suspension that was instituted by Selig's predecessor [[Fay Vincent]]. [[Pete Rose]] has claimed that he applied for reinstatement over the years and received no such consideration. Rose, along with his close friend and former teammate [[Mike Schmidt]] (who is a strong supporter of Rose's reinstatement into baseball), met with Selig in 2002, where Rose privately admitted to Selig (two years before going public with his admission) about [[Dowd Report|betting on baseball]]. Bud Selig was a close friend of the late [[A. Bartlett Giamatti|Bart Giamatti]], who was the commissioner when Rose was first banned from the sport in 1989.\n\nAs acting commissioner, Selig represented MLB during the [[1994\u201395 Major League Baseball strike|1994 players strike]] and cancelled the [[1994 World Series|World Series]], marking the first time the annual event had not been staged since [[1904 World Series|1904]].\n\n== Commissioner (1998\u20132015) ==\n\nAfter a six-year search for a new commissioner, the owners voted to give Selig the title on a permanent basis midway through the [[1998 in baseball|1998 season]].\n\nDuring his tenure the game avoided a third work stoppage in 2002, and has seen the implementation of [[interleague play]].\n\nWhereas in the past, the [[National League|National]] and [[American League|American]] leagues had separate administrative organizations (which, for example, allowed for the introduction of different rules such as the [[designated hitter]]), under Selig, Major League Baseball consolidated the administrative functions of both leagues into the Commissioner's Office in 2000. The last official presidents of the NL and AL were [[Leonard S. Coleman Jr.]] and Dr. [[Gene Budig]] respectively.\n\n=== Reaction after September 11, 2001 ===\n\nOn September 11, 2001, Selig ordered all baseball games postponed for a week because of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|terror attacks on New York and Washington]]. The games were postponed not only out of respect and mourning for the victims, but also out of concern for the safety and security of fans and players.\n\n===2001 contraction attempt===\n\nAfter the conclusion of the [[2001 World Series]], Selig held a vote on contracting two teams, reportedly the [[Minnesota Twins]] and [[Montreal Expos]].<ref name=\"ESPN-ContractionTimeline\">{{cite web| last = Schoenfield| first = David| title = Still 30 teams: Contraction timeline| publisher = ESPN.com| date = February 5, 2002| url = http://static.espn.go.com/mlb/s/2002/0205/1323230.html| accessdate = October 7, 2008 }}</ref>  This action led to Selig (along with former Expos owner [[Jeffrey Loria]]) being sued for racketeering and conspiring with Loria to deliberately defraud the Expos minority owners.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Chass|first1=Murray|authorlink1=Murray Chass|title=A Group's Racketeering Suit Brings Baseball to Full Bristle|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/17/sports/baseball-a-group-s-racketeering-suit-brings-baseball-to-full-bristle.html|accessdate=February 11, 2016|work=New York Times|date=July 17, 2002}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Joseph|first1=Dave|title=Keep An Eye On Selig, Loria|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2002-07-17/sports/0207170092_1_marlins-bud-selig-suit|accessdate=February 11, 2016|work=Sun Sentinel|date=July 17, 2002}}</ref> If found liable, the league could have been ordered to pay as much as $500 million in total damages.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Grace|first1=Francie|title=Racketeering Suit Names Baseball Execs|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/racketeering-suit-names-baseball-execs/|accessdate=February 11, 2016|agency=Reuters|publisher=CBS News|date=July 17, 2002}}</ref> The judge also ruled that the Expos could not be moved or contracted until the case was over.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Talalay|first1=Sarah|title=Suit Against Marlins' Loria Put On Hold Pending Arbitration Ruling|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2002-11-16/sports/0211150867_1_jeffrey-loria-loria-and-samson-arbitration|accessdate=February 11, 2016|work=Sun Sentinel|date=November 16, 2002|quote=Kessler was also not disappointed by the judge's ruling, which allows the partners to come back to court to request an injunction to prevent the Expos from being relocated, should baseball try to move them before the arbitration is resolved.}}</ref> The case eventually went to arbitration and was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum.<ref>{{cite news|title=Once panel makes decision, other options then unfold|url=http://espn.go.com/espn/print?id=1461497&type=news|accessdate=February 11, 2016|agency=Associated Press|publisher=ESPN.com|date=November 15, 2002}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=How Jeff Loria became the miracle Marlin|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/nathanvardi/2011/11/14/how-jeff-loria-became-the-miracle-marlin/|accessdate=February 11, 2016|first1=Nathan|last1=Vardi|work=Forbes|date=November 14, 2011}}</ref>\n\nA week after Selig's announcement, Hennepin County Judge Harry Seymour Crump issued a temporary restraining order that forced the Twins to honor their lease and play the 2002 season at the [[Metrodome]].<ref name=ipppav>http://www.twincities.com/2014/07/10/contraction-nearly-stole-twins-baseball-from-minnesota/</ref>  In August 2002, the effort to contract the Twins officially fizzled as players and owners reached a consensus on a new labor agreement which extended the team's [[Metrodome]] lease.<ref name=ipppav />\n\n=== Changes to the MLB All-Star Game ===\n\nThe [[2002 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|2002 All-Star Game]], played in Selig's hometown of [[Miller Park (Milwaukee)|Milwaukee]], was tied 7\u20137 after nine innings, and remained tied after the bottom of the 11th inning. Due to the recent managerial trend of granting playing time to as many available players as possible within the regulation nine innings, both managers had used their entire roster. Concerned for the arms of the pitchers currently on the mound, Selig made the controversial decision to declare the game a tie,<ref name=\"usaToday-2007-07-10\">{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/allstar/2007-07-10-AllStartiegamefeature_N.htm | work=USA Today | title=Tie in '02 All-Star Game mattered | first=Bob | last=Nightengale | date=July 11, 2007}}</ref> to the dissatisfaction of the Milwaukee fans. Selig later said that this call was \"embarrassing\" and that he was \"tremendously saddened\" by the outcome of the game.<ref name=\"usaToday-2007-07-10\"/>\n\nSelig subsequently tried to reinvigorate the All-Star Game by awarding the winning league home-field advantage in the World Series; that practice was initiated in 2003 and continued through 2016. The [[2003 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|2003 All-Star Game]] had the same U.S. viewership as 2002 (9.5 [[Share (ratings)|rating]]; 17 [[Ratings share|share]]) and the ratings declined in 2004 (8.8 rating; 15 share) and 2005 (8.1 rating; 14 share).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/asgbox/asgtv.shtml |title=All-Star Game Television Ratings on Baseball Almanac |publisher=Baseball-almanac.com |date= |accessdate=October 17, 2009}}</ref> The American television audience increased in 2006 (9.3 rating; 16 share).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/baseball/mlb/specials/all_star/2006/07/12/bc.bbo.all.starratings.ap/index.html |title=SI.com&nbsp;\u2014 MLB - 2006 All Star Game&nbsp;\u2014 Ratings up for All-Star Game, HR Derby&nbsp;\u2014 Wednesday July 12, 2006 6:41PM |work=Sports Illustrated|date=July 12, 2006 |accessdate=October 17, 2009}}</ref>\n\n=== Disciplinary actions ===\n\nOn July 1, 2005, Selig suspended [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] pitcher [[Kenny Rogers (baseball)|Kenny Rogers]] for 20 games and fined him US$50,000. On June 29, 2005, Rogers had purposely grabbed the camera of a cameraman, resulting in one camera falling to the ground. When the cameraman proceeded to pick up his camera, Rogers went back to him in an arguably threatening way. One of the reporters then resumed filming and Rogers knocked him down again.<ref name=\"ESPN-KennyRogers\">{{cite news| agency = Associated Press| authorlink = Associated Press| title = Rangers pitcher threatens and confronts cameramen| publisher = ESPN.com| date = June 30, 2005| url = http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2097491| accessdate = January 16, 2010 }}</ref> While an appeal of his suspension was pending, Rogers appeared at the [[2005 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|2005 All-Star Game]] in [[Detroit Michigan|Detroit]], where fans loudly booed him. On July 22, 2005, Selig heard Rogers' appeal of his suspension. Selig decided to uphold the 20 games, however, an independent arbitrator ruled that Selig had exceeded his authority and reduced it to 13 games, but upheld the fine.\n\n=== Performance-enhancing drugs ===\n{{main|2006 Baseball steroids investigation}}\n\nIn 2005, Selig faced [[U.S. Congress|Congress]] on the issue of [[Anabolic steroids|steroids]]. After the Congressional hearings in early 2005, and with the scrutiny of the sports and national media upon this issue, Selig put forth a proposal for a stricter performance-enhancing drug testing regime to replace the current system. This proposal also included the banning of [[amphetamines]], a first for the major North American sports leagues. The [[Major League Baseball Players Association|MLB Players Association]] and MLB reached an agreement in November on the new policy.<ref>{{cite news |title = MLBPA/MLB joint announcement |url = http://mlbplayers.mlb.com/pa/releases/releases.jsp?content=111505 |publisher = MLBPA |date = November 15, 2005 |accessdate = March 21, 2007}}</ref>\n\nSelig's testimony on the subject has been contradictory.  In 2005, Selig told reporters, \"I never even heard about them [steroids] until 1998 or 1999.  I ran a team and nobody was closer to their players and I never heard any comment from them.  It wasn't until 1998 or '99 that I heard the discussion.\"<ref>[http://www.commondreams.org/views05/0215-23.htm Bashing Bush: Jose Canseco Comes Clean<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120623020901/http://www.commondreams.org/views05/0215-23.htm |date=June 23, 2012 }}</ref>  But a year later, testifying to Congress in 2006, Selig claimed personal credit for spotting the problem early: \"In 1994, before anybody was really talking about steroids in baseball, we proposed a program of testing for such substances to the MLBPA.

On March 30, 2006, as a response to the controversy of the use of performance-enhancing drugs and the anticipated career home run record to be set by [[Barry Bonds]], Selig asked former [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[George J. Mitchell]]  to lead an independent investigation into the use of steroids in baseball's recent past. [[Joe Sheehan]] from ''[[Baseball Prospectus]]'' wrote that the commission has been focusing \"blame for the era exclusively on uniformed personnel\", and failing to investigate any role played by team ownership and management.<ref>{{cite web | last = Sheehan | first = Joe | title = Prospectus Today&nbsp;\u2014 Break with the Past | publisher = Baseball Prospectus | date = May 22, 2007 | url = http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=6261 | accessdate = August 14, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nMuch controversy surrounded Selig and his involvement in Bonds' all-time home run record chase. For months, speculation surrounded Selig and the possibility that he and [[Hank Aaron|Henry Aaron]] would not attend Bonds' games as he closed in on the record. Selig announced in July 2007 when Bonds was near 755 home runs that he would attend the games. Selig was in attendance for Bonds' record-tying home run against the [[San Diego Padres]], sitting in Padres owner [[John Moores (baseball)|John Moores]]' private suite. When Bonds hit his 755th home run, Selig refused to applaud Bonds' accomplishment, instead choosing to keep his hands in his pockets and have a look of disdain on his face. Bud Selig also did not attend the [[San Francisco Giants]]' game on August 7 when Barry Bonds hit his record-breaking 756th home run against the [[Washington Nationals]]; after the event, Selig released a statement congratulating Bonds.\n\nOn December 13, 2007, former senator Mitchell released his [[Mitchell Report (baseball)|report on the use of performance-enhancing substances by MLB players]]. The report names many current and former players who allegedly used performance-enhancing drugs during their career.\n\nSelig has been widely criticized for not taking an active enough role to stem the tide of steroid use in baseball until it had blossomed into a debilitating problem for the industry. ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' columnist [[Jay Mariotti]] called Selig the \"Steroids Commissioner.\"<ref>[http://www.suntimes.com/sports/mariotti/742620,mariotti011608.article Selig's only legacy: S-T-E-R-O-I-D-S]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080324132320/http://www.suntimes.com/sports/mariotti/742620%2Cmariotti011608.article |date=March 24, 2008 }}</ref> Selig has been called to [[United States Congress|Congress]] several times to testify on performance-enhancing drug use.

[[Mike Scioscia]], manager of the American League West Division Champion Los Angeles Angels, dismissed the decision as \"Ridiculous. I don't know. Can I say it any clearer than that?

He ordered the roof at [[Minute Maid Park]] to be opened for games three and four of the [[2005 World Series]], pre-empting the authority held by the Astros. The roof was closed for all prior playoff games and similar weather conditions.<ref>{{cite web|author=John Shea. |url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2005-10-25/sports/17394710_1_general-manager-tim-purpura-roof-astros |title=WORLD SERIES NOTES Roof's not an open and shut case |publisher=Hearst Communications |date=October 25, 2005 |accessdate=November 16, 2011}}</ref> For [[Hurricane Ike]] in 2008, Selig mandated that the Astros play two home games against the [[Chicago Cubs]] in his hometown of Milwaukee despite proximity to the visiting Cubs; the home ballparks for the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] and [[Atlanta Braves]] were both available to host the games. The Astros subsequently were victims of a no-hitter by [[Carlos Zambrano]] and recorded a single hit in the following game.<ref>{{cite news|author=Karen Crouse. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/18/sports/baseball/18astros.html |title=Hurricane Sent Astros Into a Spin |work=The New York Times |date=September 17, 2008 |accessdate=November 16, 2011}}</ref> In the midst of the playoff race, this decision and its impact deeply affected the playoff race and seedings with eight teams holding winning records at the moment. The Milwaukee Brewers benefited from these events by qualifying in the playoffs as a Wild Card team, only to lose in the [[2008 National League Division Series|NLDS]] to the [[Philadelphia Phillies]], the eventual World Series winner. In 2011, Selig also demanded that the Astros move to the [[American League West]] as a condition of the sale of the franchise to businessman Jim Crane; the team switched leagues in 2013 in return for $70 million discount in the purchase price.<ref name=\"MLB-Astros-AL-approved\">{{cite web| last = Bloom| first = Barry M.| title = Astros sale to Crane, move to AL approved| publisher = MLB Advanced Media| date = November 17, 2011| url = http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20111117&content_id=25992120| accessdate = May 1, 2013}}</ref>\n\nUnited States bankruptcy judge Kevin Gross rendered a stern warning to Selig in regards to the [[2011 Los Angeles Dodgers ownership dispute]].  Treating other teams differently in regards to their media contracts drew accusations that Selig did not act in good faith with respect to the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]].  Selig rejected the television deal that [[Frank McCourt (executive)|Frank McCourt]] negotiated that intended to bring the franchise out of bankruptcy, claiming McCourt violated the Baseball Agreement. In comparison, no action was taken against [[New York Mets]] owner [[Fred Wilpon]] despite being in a similar position.  Gross stated, \"Should the Commissioner falter in proving alleged wrongdoing, the Court may allow LAD (Los Angeles Dodgers) to take further, limited discovery.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Bill Shaikin |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/oct/07/sports/la-sp-dodgers-mccourt-20111008 |title=Judge sides with MLB, but warns Bud Selig |work=Los Angeles Times |date=October 17, 2011 |accessdate=November 16, 2011}}</ref> Some critics have used Selig's handling of the Dodgers to point out a double standard in treatment of MLB owners.

The last species to go extinct, ''B. occidentalis'', was succeeded at 3,000 BC by ''B. bison''.\n\nOf the two surviving species, the [[American bison]], ''B. bison'', found only in [[North America]], is the more numerous.

During that period, a handful of ranchers gathered remnants of the existing herds to save the species from extinction. These ranchers bred some of the bison with cattle in an effort to produce \"cattleo\"<ref name=\"Halbert2007\" /> (today called \"[[beefalo]]\") Accidental crossings were also known to occur. Generally, male domestic bulls were crossed with buffalo cows, producing offspring of which only the females were fertile. The crossbred animals did not demonstrate any form of hybrid vigor, so the practice was abandoned. Wisent-American bison hybrids were briefly experimented with in Germany (and found to be fully fertile) and a herd of such animals is maintained in Russia. A herd of cattle-wisent crossbreeds ([[zubron]]) is maintained in Poland. First-generation crosses do not occur naturally, requiring caesarean delivery. First-generation males are infertile. The U.S. National Bison Association has adopted a code of ethics that prohibits its members from deliberately crossbreeding bison with any other species. In the United States, many ranchers are now using DNA testing to cull the residual cattle genetics from their bison herds. The proportion of cattle DNA that has been measured in introgressed individuals and bison herds today is typically quite low, ranging from 0.56 to 1.8%.<ref name=Halbert2007/><ref name=Polziehn/>\n\nThere are also remnant purebred American bison herds on public lands in North America.

A bison wallow is a shallow depression in the soil, either wet or dry. Bison roll in these depressions, covering themselves with mud or dust. Possible explanations suggested for wallowing behavior include grooming behavior associated with moulting, male-male interaction (typically [[Rut (mammalian reproduction)|rutting]] behavior), social behavior for group cohesion, play behavior, relief from skin irritation due to biting insects, reduction of [[Parasitism|ectoparasite]] load ([[tick]]s and [[Louse|lice]]), and thermoregulation.<ref name=\"JSTOR\">{{cite journal |last=McMillan |first=B.

Typical habitat is open or semiopen grasslands, as well as sagebrush, semiarid lands, and scrublands. Some lightly wooded areas are also known historically to have supported bison.

They are also classified as [[fermion]]s, ''i.e.'', they have half-integer [[Spin (physics)|spin]]. \n\nThe name \"baryon\" comes from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word for \"heavy\" (\u03b2\u03b1\u03c1\u03cd\u03c2, ''bar\u00fds''), because, at the time of their naming, most known elementary particles had lower masses than the baryons. Each baryon has a corresponding [[antiparticle]] (antibaryon) where their corresponding antiquarks replace quarks. For example, a proton is made of two [[up quark]]s and one [[down quark]]; and its corresponding antiparticle, the [[antiproton]], is made of two up antiquarks and one down antiquark.\n\nAs quark-based particles, baryons participate in the [[strong interaction]], which is [[force carrier|mediated]] by particles known as [[gluon]]s. The most familiar baryons are [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s, both of which contain three quarks, and for this reason these particles are sometimes described as '''triquarks'''.  These particles make up most of the mass of the visible [[matter]] in the [[universe]], as well as forming the components of the [[atomic nucleus|nucleus of every atom]]. [[Electron]]s (the other major component of the [[atom]]) are members of a different family of particles, known as [[lepton]]s, which do not interact via the strong force. [[Exotic baryon]]s containing five quarks (known as [[pentaquark]]s) have also been discovered and studied.\n\n==Background==\nBaryons are strongly interacting [[fermion]]s; that is, they are acted on by the [[strong nuclear force]] and are described by [[Fermi\u2212Dirac statistics]], which apply to all particles obeying the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]. This is in contrast to the [[boson]]s, which do not obey the exclusion principle.\n\nBaryons, along with [[meson]]s, are [[hadron]]s, particles composed of [[quark]]s. Quarks have [[baryon number]]s of ''B''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{sfrac|1|3}} and antiquarks have baryon numbers of ''B''&nbsp;=&nbsp;\u2212{{sfrac|1|3}}. The term \"baryon\" usually refers to ''triquarks''\u2014baryons made of three quarks (''B''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{sfrac|1|3}}&nbsp;+&nbsp;{{sfrac|1|3}}&nbsp;+&nbsp;{{sfrac|1|3}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;1).\n\nOther [[exotic baryon]]s have been proposed, such as [[pentaquark]]s\u2014baryons made of four quarks and one antiquark (''B''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{sfrac|1|3}}&nbsp;+&nbsp;{{sfrac|1|3}}&nbsp;+&nbsp;{{sfrac|1|3}}&nbsp;+&nbsp;{{sfrac|1|3}}&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;{{sfrac|1|3}}&nbsp;=&nbsp;1),<ref>H.

Non-baryonic matter, as implied by the name, is any sort of matter that is not composed primarily of baryons. This might include [[neutrino]]s and free [[electron]]s, [[dark matter]], [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric particles]], [[axion]]s, and [[black hole]]s.\n\nThe very existence of baryons is also a significant issue in cosmology because it is assumed that the Big Bang produced a state with equal amounts of baryons and antibaryons. The process by which baryons came to outnumber their [[antiparticle]]s is called [[baryogenesis]].\n\n==Baryogenesis==\n{{Main article|Baryogenesis}}\n\nExperiments are consistent with the number of quarks in the universe being a constant and, to be more specific,  the number of baryons being a constant {{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}; in technical language, the total [[baryon number]] appears to be ''[[Conservation law (physics)|conserved]].''  Within the prevailing [[Standard Model]] of particle physics, the number of baryons may change in multiples of three due to the action of [[sphaleron]]s, although this is rare and has not been observed under experiment.  Some [[grand unified theory|grand unified theories]] of particle physics also predict that a single [[proton]] can decay, changing the baryon number by one; however, this has not yet been observed under experiment. The excess of baryons over antibaryons in the present universe is thought to be due to non-[[conservation of baryon number]] in the very early universe, though this is not well understood.\n\n==Properties==\n\n===Isospin and charge===\n{{Main article|Isospin}}\n\n[[File:Baryon-decuplet-small.svg|thumb|200px|\nCombinations of three '''[[up quark|u]], [[down quark|d]]''' or '''[[strange quark|s]]''' quarks forming baryons with a spin-{{sfrac|3|2}} form the ''[[Eightfold way (physics)|uds baryon decuplet]]'']]\n[[File:Baryon-octet-small.svg|thumb|200px|Combinations of three '''[[up quark|u]], [[down quark|d]]''' or '''[[strange quark|s]]''' quarks forming baryons with a spin-{{sfrac|1|2}} form the ''[[Eightfold way (physics)|uds baryon octet]]'']]\n\nThe concept of isospin was first proposed by [[Werner Heisenberg]] in 1932 to explain the similarities between protons and neutrons under the [[strong interaction]].<ref>W. Heisenberg (1932)</ref> Although they had different electric charges, their masses were so similar that physicists believed they were the same particle. The different electric charges were explained as being the result of some unknown excitation similar to spin. This unknown excitation was later dubbed ''isospin'' by [[Eugene Wigner]] in 1937.<ref>E. Wigner (1937)</ref>\n\nThis belief lasted until [[Murray Gell-Mann]] proposed the [[quark model]] in 1964 (containing originally only the u, d, and s quarks).<ref>M. Gell-Mann (1964)</ref> The success of the isospin model is now understood to be the result of the similar masses of u and d quarks. Since u and d quarks have similar masses, particles made of the same number then also have similar masses. The exact specific u and d quark composition determines the charge, as u quarks carry charge +{{sfrac|2|3}} while d quarks carry charge \u2212{{sfrac|1|3}}. For example, the four [[Delta baryon|Deltas]] all have different charges ({{SubatomicParticle|Delta++}} (uuu), {{SubatomicParticle|Delta+}} (uud), {{SubatomicParticle|Delta0}} (udd), {{SubatomicParticle|Delta-}} (ddd)), but have similar masses (~1,232&nbsp;MeV/c<sup>2</sup>) as they are each made of a combination of three u and d quarks. Under the isospin model, they were considered to be a single particle in different charged states.\n\nThe mathematics of isospin was modeled after that of spin. Isospin projections varied in increments of 1 just like those of spin, and to each projection was associated a \"[[Quantum state|charged state]]\". Since the \"[[Delta baryon|Delta particle]]\" had four \"charged states\", it was said to be of isospin ''I''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{sfrac|3|2}}. Its \"charged states\" {{SubatomicParticle|Delta++}}, {{SubatomicParticle|Delta+}}, {{SubatomicParticle|Delta0}}, and {{SubatomicParticle|Delta-}}, corresponded to the isospin projections ''I''<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;+{{sfrac|3|2}}, ''I''<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;+{{sfrac|1|2}}, ''I''<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;\u2212{{sfrac|1|2}}, and ''I''<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;\u2212{{sfrac|3|2}}, respectively. Another example is the \"nucleon particle\". As there were two nucleon \"charged states\", it was said to be of isospin {{sfrac|1|2}}. The positive nucleon {{SubatomicParticle|Nucleon+}} (proton) was identified with ''I''<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;+{{sfrac|1|2}} and the neutral nucleon {{SubatomicParticle|Nucleon0}} (neutron) with ''I''<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;\u2212{{sfrac|1|2}}.<ref name=WongA>S.S.M. Wong (1998a)</ref> It was later noted that the isospin projections were related to the up and down quark content of particles by the relation:<br>\n:<math>I_\\mathrm{3}=\\frac{1}{2}[(n_\\mathrm{u}-n_\\mathrm{\\bar{u}})-(n_\\mathrm{d}-n_\\mathrm{\\bar{d}})],</math>\nwhere the ''n'''s are the number of up and down quarks and antiquarks.\n\nIn the \"isospin picture\", the four Deltas and the two nucleons were thought to be the different states of two particles. However, in the quark model, Deltas are different states of nucleons (the N<sup>++</sup> or N<sup>\u2212</sup> are forbidden by [[Pauli's exclusion principle]]). Isospin, although conveying an inaccurate picture of things, is still used to classify baryons, leading to unnatural and often confusing nomenclature.\n\n===Flavour quantum numbers===\n{{Main article|Flavour (particle physics)#Flavour quantum numbers}}\n\nThe [[strangeness]] [[flavour (particle physics)#Flavour quantum numbers|flavour quantum number]] ''S'' (not to be confused with spin) was noticed to go up and down along with particle mass. The higher the mass, the lower the strangeness (the more s quarks). Particles could be described with isospin projections (related to charge) and strangeness (mass) (see the uds octet and decuplet figures on the right). As other quarks were discovered, new quantum numbers were made to have similar description of udc and udb octets and decuplets. Since only the u and d mass are similar, this description of particle mass and charge in terms of isospin and flavour quantum numbers works well only for octet and decuplet made of one u, one d, and one other quark, and breaks down for the other octets and decuplets (for example, ucb octet and decuplet). If the quarks all had the same mass, their behaviour would be called ''symmetric'', as they would all behave in the same way to the strong interaction. Since quarks do not have the same mass, they do not interact in the same way (exactly like an electron placed in an electric field will accelerate more than a proton placed in the same field because of its lighter mass), and the symmetry is said to be [[broken symmetry|broken]].\n\nIt was noted that charge (''Q'') was related to the isospin projection (''I''<sub>3</sub>), the [[baryon number]] (''B'') and flavour quantum numbers (''S'', ''C'', ''B''&prime;, ''T'') by the [[Gell-Mann\u2013Nishijima formula]]:<ref name=WongA/><br>\n:<math>Q=I_\\mathrm{3}+\\frac{1}{2}(B+S+C+B^\\prime+T),</math>\n\nwhere ''S'', ''C'', ''B''&prime;, and ''T'' represent the [[strangeness]], [[charm (quantum number)|charm]], [[bottomness]] and [[topness]] flavour quantum numbers, respectively. They are related to the number of strange, charm, bottom, and top quarks and antiquark according to the relations:<br>\n:<math>S=-(n_\\mathrm{s}-n_\\mathrm{\\bar{s}}),</math>\n:<math>C=+(n_\\mathrm{c}-n_\\mathrm{\\bar{c}}),</math>\n:<math>B^\\prime=-(n_\\mathrm{b}-n_\\mathrm{\\bar{b}}),</math>\n:<math>T=+(n_\\mathrm{t}-n_\\mathrm{\\bar{t}}),</math>\n\nmeaning that the Gell-Mann\u2013Nishijima formula is equivalent to the expression of charge in terms of quark content:\n:<math>Q=\\frac{2}{3}[(n_\\mathrm{u}-n_\\mathrm{\\bar{u}})+(n_\\mathrm{c}-n_\\mathrm{\\bar{c}})+(n_\\mathrm{t}-n_\\mathrm{\\bar{t}})]-\\frac{1}{3}[(n_\\mathrm{d}-n_\\mathrm{\\bar{d}})+(n_\\mathrm{s}-n_\\mathrm{\\bar{s}})+(n_\\mathrm{b}-n_\\mathrm{\\bar{b}})].</math>\n\n===Spin, orbital angular momentum, and total angular momentum===\n{{Main article|Spin (physics)|Angular momentum operator|Quantum numbers|Clebsch\u2013Gordan coefficients}}\n[[Spin (physics)|Spin]] (quantum number ''S'') is a [[Euclidean vector|vector]] quantity that represents the \"intrinsic\" [[angular momentum]] of a particle. It comes in increments of {{sfrac|1|2}}&nbsp;[[Planck's constant|\u0127]] (pronounced \"h-bar\"). The \u0127 is often dropped because it is the \"fundamental\" unit of spin, and it is implied that \"spin 1\" means \"spin 1&nbsp;\u0127\". In some systems of [[natural units]], \u0127 is chosen to be 1, and therefore does not appear anywhere.\n\n[[Quark]]s are [[fermion]]ic particles of spin {{sfrac|1|2}} (''S''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{sfrac|1|2}}). Because spin projections vary in increments of 1 (that is 1&nbsp;\u0127), a single quark has a spin vector of length {{sfrac|1|2}}, and has two spin projections (''S''<sub>z</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;+{{sfrac|1|2}} and ''S''<sub>z</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;\u2212{{sfrac|1|2}}). Two quarks can have their spins aligned, in which case the two spin vectors add to make a vector of length ''S''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 and three spin projections (''S''<sub>z</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;+1, ''S''<sub>z</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, and ''S''<sub>z</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;\u22121). If two quarks have unaligned spins, the spin vectors add up to make a vector of length ''S''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 and has only one spin projection (''S''<sub>z</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;0), etc. Since baryons are made of three quarks, their spin vectors can add to make a vector of length ''S''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{sfrac|3|2}}, which has four spin projections (''S''<sub>z</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;+{{sfrac|3|2}}, ''S''<sub>z</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;+{{sfrac|1|2}}, ''S''<sub>z</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;\u2212{{sfrac|1|2}}, and ''S''<sub>z</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;\u2212{{sfrac|3|2}}), or a vector of length ''S''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{sfrac|1|2}} with two spin projections (''S''<sub>z</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;+{{sfrac|1|2}}, and ''S''<sub>z</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;\u2212{{sfrac|1|2}}).<ref name=Shankar>R. Shankar (1994)</ref>\n\nThere is another quantity of angular momentum, called the [[angular momentum operator|orbital angular momentum]] ([[azimuthal quantum number]] ''L''), that comes in increments of 1&nbsp;\u0127, which represent the angular moment due to quarks orbiting around each other. The [[angular momentum operator|total angular momentum]] ([[total angular momentum quantum number]] ''J'') of a particle is therefore the combination of intrinsic angular momentum (spin) and orbital angular momentum. It can take any value from {{nowrap|''J'' {{=}} {{!}}''L'' \u2212 ''S''{{!}}}} to {{nowrap|''J'' {{=}} {{!}}''L'' + ''S''{{!}}}}, in increments of 1.\n<center>\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+Baryon angular momentum quantum numbers for ''L'' = 0, 1, 2, 3\n|-\n!width=\"100\"| Spin (''S'')\n!width=\"100\"| Orbital angular momentum (''L'')\n!width=\"100\"| Total angular momentum (''J'')\n!width=\"100\"| Parity (''P'')<br>([[#Parity|See below]]) \n!width=\"100\"| Condensed notation (''J''<sup>''P''</sup>)\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"| {{sfrac|1|2}} || 0 || {{sfrac|1|2}} || + || {{sfrac|1|2}}<sup>+</sup>\n|-\n| 1 || {{sfrac|3|2}}, {{sfrac|1|2}} || \u2212 || {{sfrac|3|2}}<sup>\u2212</sup>, {{sfrac|1|2}}<sup>\u2212</sup>\n|-\n| 2 || {{sfrac|5|2}}, {{sfrac|3|2}} || + || {{sfrac|5|2}}<sup>+</sup>, {{sfrac|3|2}}<sup>+</sup>\n|-\n| 3 || {{sfrac|7|2}}, {{sfrac|5|2}} || \u2212 || {{sfrac|7|2}}<sup>\u2212</sup>, {{sfrac|5|2}}<sup>\u2212</sup>\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"| {{sfrac|3|2}} || 0 || {{sfrac|3|2}} || + || {{sfrac|3|2}}<sup>+</sup>\n|-\n| 1 || {{sfrac|5|2}}, {{sfrac|3|2}}, {{sfrac|1|2}} || \u2212 || {{sfrac|5|2}}<sup>\u2212</sup>, {{sfrac|3|2}}<sup>\u2212</sup>, {{sfrac|1|2}}<sup>\u2212</sup>\n|-\n| 2 || {{sfrac|7|2}}, {{sfrac|5|2}}, {{sfrac|3|2}}, {{sfrac|1|2}} || + || {{sfrac|7|2}}<sup>+</sup>, {{sfrac|5|2}}<sup>+</sup>, {{sfrac|3|2}}<sup>+</sup>, {{sfrac|1|2}}<sup>+</sup>\n|-\n| 3 || {{sfrac|9|2}}, {{sfrac|7|2}}, {{sfrac|5|2}}, {{sfrac|3|2}} || \u2212 || {{sfrac|9|2}}<sup>\u2212</sup>, {{sfrac|7|2}}<sup>\u2212</sup>, {{sfrac|5|2}}<sup>\u2212</sup>, {{sfrac|3|2}}<sup>\u2212</sup>\n|}\n</center>\n\nParticle physicists are most interested in baryons with no orbital angular momentum (''L''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0), as they correspond to [[ground state]]s\u2014states of minimal energy. Therefore, the two groups of baryons most studied are the ''S''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{sfrac|1|2}}; ''L''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 and ''S''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{sfrac|3|2}}; ''L''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, which corresponds to ''J''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{sfrac|1|2}}<sup>+</sup> and ''J''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{sfrac|3|2}}<sup>+</sup>, respectively, although they are not the only ones. It is also possible to obtain ''J''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{sfrac|3|2}}<sup>+</sup> particles from ''S''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{sfrac|1|2}} and ''L''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2, as well as ''S''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{sfrac|3|2}} and ''L''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2. This phenomenon of having multiple particles in the same total angular momentum configuration is called ''[[degenerate energy level|degeneracy]]''. How to distinguish between these degenerate baryons is an active area of research in [[baryon spectroscopy]].<ref>H. Garcilazo ''et al.'' (2007)</ref><ref>D.M. Manley (2005)</ref>\n\n===Parity===\n{{Main article|Parity (physics)}}\n\nIf the universe were reflected in a mirror, most of the laws of physics would be identical\u2014things would behave the same way regardless of what we call \"left\" and what we call \"right\". This concept of mirror reflection is called [[parity (physics)|intrinsic parity]]\" or simply \"parity\" (''P''). [[Gravity]], the [[electromagnetic force]], and the [[strong interaction]] all behave in the same way regardless of whether or not the universe is reflected in a mirror, and thus are said to [[P-symmetry|conserve parity]] (P-symmetry). However, the [[weak interaction]] does distinguish \"left\" from \"right\", a phenomenon called [[parity violation]] (P-violation).\n\nBased on this, if the [[wavefunction]] for each particle (in more precise terms, the [[quantum field]] for each particle type) were simultaneously mirror-reversed, then the new set of wavefunctions would perfectly satisfy the laws of physics (apart from the weak interaction). It turns out that this is not quite true: for the equations to be satisfied, the wavefunctions of certain types of particles have to be multiplied by \u22121, in addition to being mirror-reversed. Such particle types are said to have negative or odd parity (''P''&nbsp;=&nbsp;\u22121, or alternatively ''P''&nbsp;=&nbsp;\u2013), while the other particles are said to have positive or even parity (''P''&nbsp;=&nbsp;+1, or alternatively ''P''&nbsp;=&nbsp;+).\n\nFor baryons, the parity is related to the orbital angular momentum by the relation:<ref name=WongB>S.S.M. Wong (1998b)</ref>\n:<math>P=(-1)^L.\\ </math>\n\nAs a consequence, baryons with no orbital angular momentum (''L''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0) all have even parity (''P''&nbsp;=&nbsp;+).\n\n==Nomenclature==\nBaryons are classified into groups according to their [[isospin]] (''I'') values and [[quark]] (''q'') content. There are six groups of baryons\u2014[[nucleon]] ({{SubatomicParticle|Nucleon}}), [[Delta baryon|Delta]] ({{SubatomicParticle|Delta}}), [[Lambda baryon|Lambda]] ({{SubatomicParticle|Lambda}}), [[Sigma baryon|Sigma]] ({{SubatomicParticle|Sigma}}), [[Xi baryon|Xi]] ({{SubatomicParticle|Xi}}), and [[Omega baryon|Omega]] ({{SubatomicParticle|Omega}}). The rules for classification are defined by the [[Particle Data Group]]. These rules consider the [[up quark|up]] ({{SubatomicParticle|Up quark}}), [[down quark|down]] ({{SubatomicParticle|Down quark}}) and [[strange quark|strange]] ({{SubatomicParticle|Strange quark}}) quarks to be ''light'' and the [[charm quark|charm]] ({{SubatomicParticle|Charm quark}}), [[bottom quark|bottom]] ({{SubatomicParticle|Bottom quark}}), and [[top quark|top]] ({{SubatomicParticle|Top quark}}) quarks to be ''heavy''. The rules cover all the particles that can be made from three of each of the six quarks, even though baryons made of top quarks are not expected to exist because of the [[top quark|top quark's short lifetime]]. The rules do not cover pentaquarks.<ref name=PDGBaryonsymbols>C. Amsler ''et al.'' (2008): [http://pdg.lbl.gov/2008/reviews/namingrpp.pdf Naming scheme for hadrons]</ref>\n\n* Baryons with three {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Up quark}} and/or {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Down quark}} quarks are {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Nucleon}}'s (''I'' = {{sfrac|1|2}}) or {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Delta}}'s (''I'' = {{sfrac|3|2}}).\n* Baryons with two {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Up quark}} and/or {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Down quark}} quarks are {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Lambda}}'s (''I'' = 0) or {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Sigma}}'s (''I'' = 1). If the third quark is heavy, its identity is given by a subscript.\n* Baryons with one {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Up quark}} or {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Down quark}} quark are {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Xi}}'s (''I'' = {{sfrac|1|2}}). One or two subscripts are used if one or both of the remaining quarks are heavy.\n* Baryons with no {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Up quark}} or {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Down quark}} quarks are {{SubatomicParticle|link=yes|Omega}}'s (''I'' = 0), and subscripts indicate any heavy quark content.\n* Baryons that decay strongly have their masses as part of their names. For example, \u03a3<sup>0</sup> does not decay strongly, but \u0394<sup>++</sup>(1232) does.\n\nIt is also a widespread (but not universal) practice to follow some additional rules when distinguishing between some states that would otherwise have the same symbol.<ref name=WongA/>\n\n* Baryons in [[total angular momentum]] ''J''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{sfrac|3|2}} configuration that have the same symbols as their ''J''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{sfrac|1|2}} counterparts are denoted by an asterisk (&nbsp;*&nbsp;).\n* Two baryons can be made of three different quarks in ''J''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{sfrac|1|2}} configuration. In this case, a prime (&nbsp;&prime;&nbsp;) is used to distinguish between them.\n** ''Exception'': When two of the three quarks are one up and one down quark, one baryon is dubbed \u039b while the other is dubbed \u03a3.\n\nQuarks carry a charge, so knowing the charge of a particle indirectly gives the quark content. For example, the rules above say that a {{SubatomicParticle|charmed Lambda+}} contains a c quark and some combination of two u and/or d quarks. The c quark has a charge of (''Q''&nbsp;=&nbsp;+{{sfrac|2|3}}), therefore the other two must be a u quark (''Q''&nbsp;=&nbsp;+{{sfrac|2|3}}), and a d quark (''Q''&nbsp;=&nbsp;\u2212{{sfrac|1|3}}) to have the correct total charge (''Q''&nbsp;=&nbsp;+1).\n\n== See also ==\n{{Wikipedia books\n |1=Hadronic Matter\n |3=Particles of the Standard Model\n}}\n* [[Eightfold way (physics)|Eightfold way]]\n* [[List of baryons]]\n* [[Meson]]\n* [[Timeline of particle discoveries]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite journal |author=C.

Using [[braille translator|braille translation]] software, a document can be embossed with relative ease, making braille production efficient and cost-effective.\n\nBlind users tend to call other [[Printer (computing)|printer]]s \"ink printers,\" to distinguish them from their braille counterparts. This is often the case regardless of the type of printer being discussed (e.g., [[Thermal printing|thermal printers]] being called \"ink printers\" even though they use no ink).\n\nAs with ink printers and presses, embossers range from those intended for consumers to those used by large publishers. Thus, an embosser can cost roughly anywhere from US$2,000 to $150,000.\n\n== Types ==\nThe fastest industrial braille embosser is probably the $77,000 Belgian-made [[NV Interpoint 55]], first produced in 1991, which uses a separate [[air compressor]] to drive the embossing head and can output up to 800 braille characters per second. Adoption was slow at first; in 2000 the [[National Federation of the Blind]] said there were only three of these in the USA, one owned by the NFB itself and the other two by the [[Watchtower Bible and Tract Society]].<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20120219022351/http://nfb.org/legacy/bm/bm00/bm0005/brlm0005.htm</ref> As of 2008 there are more than 60 in use across the world.<ref>http://www.givengain.com/unique/blindsa/upload/blindsa1008.doc</ref>\n\nSmaller desktop braille embossers are more common and can be found in libraries, universities, and specialist education centers, as well as being privately owned by blind individuals. Particularly with some lower-priced embossers, it may be necessary to use an acoustic cabinet or hood to [[Soundproofing|dampen the noise level]].\n\nBraille embossers usually need special braille paper which is thicker and more expensive than normal paper. Some high-end embossers are capable of printing on normal paper. Embossers can be either one-sided or two-sided. Duplex embossing requires lining up the dots so they do not overlap (called \"interpoint\" because the points on the other side are placed in between the points on the first side).\n\nOnce one copy of a document has been produced, printing further copies is often quicker by means of a device called a [[thermoform]], which produces copies on soft plastic. However the resulting braille is not as easily readable as braille that has been freshly embossed, in much the same way that a poor-quality [[photocopy]] is not as readable as the original. Hence large publishers do not generally use thermoforms.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Braigo]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n{{FOLDOC}}\n\n{{Braille}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Braille Embosser}}\n[[Category:Braille technology]]", "sha1": "jb79oatukklqqugwd1w99qnh4lwq2sx"}}, {"title": "Brachycephalic", "ns": "0", "id": "4590", "redirect": {"title": "Brachycephaly"}, "revision": {"id": "343921978", "parentid": "15902852", "timestamp": "2010-02-14T04:22:21Z", "contributor": {"username": "Dodo bird", "id": "901231"}, "minor": "", "comment": "#REDIRECT [[Brachycephaly]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Brachycephaly]]", "sha1": "pdghld1hq8dg23g5wnh6v0ayh5hep8l"}}, {"title": "Basic Role-Playing", "ns": "0", "id": "4592", "revision": {"id": "849242136", "parentid": "815638477", "timestamp": "2018-07-07T15:38:19Z", "contributor": {"ip": "2602:306:BD63:6CA0:45E7:415:5991:DB28"}, "comment": "/* Licensed games */ fixed nonsense sentence", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Italic title}}\n{{Infobox RPG\n|title=Basic Role-Playing (BRP)\n|image=[[Image:Basic Roleplaying.gif|200px]]\n|caption=Cover of the first edition of ''Basic Role-Playing''\n|designer=[[Greg Stafford]] and [[Lynn Willis]]\n|publisher=[[Chaosium]]\n|date=1980, 1982, 2002, 2004, 2008\n|genre=Universal\n}}\n\n'''''Basic Role-Playing''''' ('''''BRP''''') is a [[role-playing game system]] which originated in the ''[[RuneQuest]]'' [[fantasy]] [[role-playing game]].

A percentile skill-based system, ''BRP'' was used as the basis for most of the games published by [[Chaosium]], including  ''[[Call of Cthulhu (role-playing game)|Call of Cthulhu]]'', ''[[Stormbringer (role-playing game)|Stormbringer]]'', and ''[[Elfquest (role-playing game)|Elfquest]]''.\n\n== History ==\nThe core rules were originally written by [[Steve Perrin]]<ref>{{cite journal| last =Ehara| first =Tadashi| authorlink = Tadashi Ehara| coauthors =  | title =My Life and Role-Playing| journal =[[Different Worlds]]| volume = | issue = 3| pages =8\u20139| publisher =[[Chaosium]]|date=June\u2013July 1979}}</ref> as part of his game ''RuneQuest''.<ref>{{cite journal| last =Donohoe| first =Jim| authorlink = | coauthors =  | title =Open Box: Runequest| journal =[[White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf]]| volume = | issue = 11| pages =18\u201319| publisher =[[Games Workshop]]|date=February\u2013March 1979| issn = 0265-8712}}</ref> It was [[Greg Stafford]]'s idea to simplify the rules (eliminating such things as Strike Ranks and Hit Locations) and issue them in a 16-page booklet called ''Basic Role-Playing''. Over the years several others, including [[Sandy Petersen]], [[Lynn Willis]], and [[Steve Henderson (game designer)|Steve Henderson]], contributed to the system.\n\nThe ''BRP'' was notable for being the first role-playing game system to introduce a full skill system to characters regardless of their profession. This was developed in ''RuneQuest'' but was also later adopted by the more skill-oriented ''Call of Cthulhu''.<ref>{{cite journal | last =Turnbull  | first =Don | title =Open Box: Call of Cthulhu | journal =[[White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf]] | issue = 32 | pages =18 | publisher =[[Games Workshop]]|date=August 1982| issn = 0265-8712}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal| last =Szymanski| first =Michael  | title =Call of Cthulhu in the Eighties| journal =[[Different Worlds]]| issue = 45| pages =8\u20139 | publisher =[[Chaosium]] |date=March\u2013April 1987}}</ref> \n\n''BRP'' was conceived of as a generic system for playing any sort of RPG. Specific rule systems to support differing genres can be added to the core rules in a modular design. In order to underscore this, in 1982 Chaosium released the ''[[Worlds of Wonder (game)|Worlds of Wonder]]'' box set, which contained a revised main booklet and several booklets providing the additional rules for playing in specific genres. ''[[Superworld]]'', a superhero-themed game, began as a portion of the ''Worlds of Wonder'' set. A third edition of the core booklet, now titled ''Basic Roleplaying: The Chaosium System'', was released in 2002.<ref>{{cite book|title=Basic Roleplaying: The Chaosium System|last1=Stafford|first1=Greg|last2=Willis|first2=Lynn|isbn=9781568821689|year=2002}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, Chaosium published the ''Basic Roleplaying'' monographs, a series of paperback booklets. The first four monographs (''Players Book'', ''Magic Book'', ''Creatures Book'', and ''Gamemaster Book'') were essentially ''RuneQuest'' 3rd Edition, but with the ''RuneQuest'' name and other trademarks removed, as Chaosium had lost the rights to the name but retained copyright of the rules text. Additional monographs allowing for new mechanics, thereby extending the system to other genres, were released in the following years. Many of these mongraphs reproduced rules from other Chaosium-published ''BRP'' games that had gone out of print. \n\nIn 2008 most monographs were collected and updated as a single, comprehensive book, nicknamed the \"Big Gold Book\", allowing game masters to essentially build their own game from the various subsystems included. A quickstart booklet for new players accompanied it.\n\nOther games published over the years by Chaosium using the ''BRP'' ruleset include ''[[Ringworld (RPG)|Ringworld]]'', ''[[Hawkmoon (role-playing game)|Hawkmoon]]'', and ''[[Nephilim (RPG)|Nephilim]]''.\n\n== Rules system ==\n''BRP'' is similar to other generic systems such as ''[[GURPS]]'', ''[[Hero System]]'' or ''[[Savage Worlds]]'' in that it uses a simple resolution method which can be broadly applied. ''BRP'' uses a core set of seven [[Ability score|characteristics]]: Size, Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Power, and Appearance or Charisma. From those, a character derives scores in various [[Skill (role-playing)|skills]], expressed as percentages. These skill scores are the basis of play. When attempting an action, the player rolls percentile dice trying to get a result equal to or lower than the character's current skill score. Each incarnation of the ''BRP'' rules has changed or added to the core ideas and mechanics, so that games are not identical. For example, in ''Call of Cthulhu'', skills may never be over 100%, while in ''Stormbringer'' skills in excess of 100% are within reach for all characters. Scores can increase through experience checks, the mechanics of which vary in an individual game. \n\n''BRP'' treats armor and defense as separate functions: the act of parrying is a defensive skill that reduced an opponent's chance to successfully land an attack, and the purpose of armor is to absorb damage. \n\nThe last major element of many ''BRP'' games is that there is no difference between the player character race systems and that of the monster or opponents. By varying ability scores, the same system is used for a human hero as a troll villain. This approach allows for players to play a wide variety of non-human species.\n\n== Licensed games ==\nChaosium was an early adopter of licensing out its ''BRP'' system to other companies, something that was unique at the time they began but rather commonplace now thanks to the [[D20 System|d20]] licenses.<ref name=\"bhotg7\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rpg.net/columns/briefhistory/briefhistory7.phtml |title=Brief History of the Game |accessdate=2007-09-14 |author=Shannon Appelcline |date=2006-11-02 |work= |publisher=RPG.Net| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070923012632/http://www.rpg.net/columns/briefhistory/briefhistory7.phtml| archivedate= 23 September 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>  This places the ''BRP'' in the notable position of being one of the first products to allow other game companies to develop games or game aids for their work. Companies such as Green Knight and [[Pagan Publishing]] built their earliest works to support Chaosium's games.\n\nOther, non-Chaosium games have used ''BRP'' for its core rules. For example, ''[[Other Suns]]'', published by [[Fantasy Games Unlimited]] (FGU), used them under license. ''BRP'' was also used as the base for the highly successful Swedish game ''[[Drakar och Demoner]]'' from [[Target Games]].<ref>http://www.svd.se/drakar-och-demoner-flyger-igen<small>(in Swedish)</small></ref>\n\n==Reception==\nRonald Pehr reviewed ''Basic Role-Playing'' in ''[[The Space Gamer]]'' No. 41.<ref name=\"SG\">{{cite journal|last=Pehr |first=Ronald |date=July 1981 |title=Capsule Reviews|journal=[[The Space Gamer]]|publisher=[[Steve Jackson Games]]|issue=41|pages=30}}</ref> Pehr commented that \"''Basic Role-Playing'' is too little too late.

It also influenced the academic development of [[cryptanalysis|cryptanalytic attack]]s. Both [[differential cryptanalysis|differential]] and [[linear cryptanalysis]] arose out of studies on the DES design. {{As of | 2016}} there is a palette of attack techniques against which a block cipher must be secure, in addition to being robust against [[brute-force attack]]s.\n\nEven a secure block cipher is suitable only for the encryption of a single block under a fixed key. A multitude of [[block cipher modes of operation|modes of operation]] have been designed to allow their repeated use in a secure way, commonly to achieve the security goals of [[confidentiality]] and [[authentication|authenticity]].

However, this will make the cipher inefficient. Thus, efficiency is the most important additional design criterion for professional ciphers. Further, a good block cipher is designed to avoid side-channel attacks, such as input-dependent memory accesses that might leak secret data via the cache state or the execution time. In addition, the cipher should be concise, for small hardware and software implementations. Finally, the cipher should be easily cryptanalyzable, such that it can be shown how many rounds the cipher needs to be reduced to, so that the existing cryptographic attacks would work \u2013 and, conversely, that it can be shown that the number of actual rounds is large enough to protect against them.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n===Substitution\u2013permutation networks===\n[[Image:SubstitutionPermutationNetwork2.png|thumb|200px|right|A sketch of a substitution\u2013permutation network with 3 rounds, encrypting a plaintext block of 16 bits into a ciphertext block of 16 bits.

In the simplest case, known as the [[Electronic Codebook]] (ECB) mode, a message is first split into separate blocks of the cipher's block size (possibly extending the last block with [[Padding (cryptography)|padding]] bits), and then each block is encrypted and decrypted independently.

The resultant ciphertext block is then used as the new initialization vector for the next plaintext block. In the [[cipher feedback]] (CFB) mode, which emulates a [[stream cipher#Self-synchronizing stream ciphers|self-synchronizing stream cipher]], the initialization vector is first encrypted and then added to the plaintext block.

The newer [[counter mode|counter]] (CTR) mode similarly creates a key stream, but has the advantage of only needing unique and not (pseudo-)random values as initialization vectors; the needed randomness is derived internally by using the initialization vector as a block counter and encrypting this counter for each block.<ref name=\"nist800-38a\"/>\n\nFrom a [[provable security|security-theoretic]] point of view, modes of operation must provide what is known as [[semantic security]].{{sfn|Bellare|Rogaway|2005|loc=section 5.6}} Informally, it means that given some ciphertext under an unknown key one cannot practically derive any information from the ciphertext (other than the length of the message) over what one would have known without seeing the ciphertext.

On the other hand, CBC mode can be proven to be secure under the assumption that the underlying block cipher is likewise secure. Note, however, that making statements like this requires formal mathematical definitions for what it means for an encryption algorithm or a block cipher to \"be secure\". This section describes two common notions for what properties a block cipher should have. Each corresponds to a mathematical model that can be used to prove properties of higher level algorithms, such as CBC.\n\nThis general approach to cryptography \u2013 proving higher-level algorithms (such as CBC) are secure under explicitly stated assumptions regarding their components (such as a block cipher) \u2013 is known as ''provable security''.\n\n===Standard model===\n{{main | Ciphertext indistinguishability }}\nInformally, a block cipher is secure in the standard model if an attacker cannot tell the difference between the block cipher (equipped with a random key) and a random permutation.\n\nTo be a bit more precise, let ''E'' be an ''n''-bit block cipher. We imagine the following game:\n# The person running the game flips a coin.\n#* If the coin lands on heads, he chooses a random key ''K'' and defines the function ''f = E<sub>K</sub>''.\n#* If the coin lands on tails, he chooses a random permutation ''{{pi}}'' on the set of ''n''-bit strings, and defines the function ''f = {{pi}}''.\n# The attacker chooses an ''n''-bit string ''X'', and the person running the game tells him the value of ''f(X)''.\n# Step 2 is repeated a total of ''q'' times. (Each of these ''q'' interactions is a ''query''.)\n# The attacker guesses how the coin landed. He wins if his guess is correct.\n\nThe attacker, which we can model as an algorithm, is called an ''[[Adversary (cryptography)|adversary]]''. The function ''f'' (which the adversary was able to query) is called an ''[[Oracle machine|oracle]]''.\n\nNote that an adversary can trivially ensure a 50% chance of winning simply by guessing at random (or even by, for example, always guessing \"heads\"). Therefore, let ''P<sub>E</sub>(A)'' denote the probability that the adversary ''A'' wins this game against ''E'', and define the ''advantage'' of ''A'' as 2(''P<sub>E</sub>(A)'' \u2212 1/2). It follows that if ''A'' guesses randomly, its advantage will be 0; on the other hand, if ''A'' always wins, then its advantage is 1. The block cipher ''E'' is a ''pseudo-random permutation'' (PRP) if no adversary has an advantage significantly greater than 0, given specified restrictions on ''q'' and the adversary's running time. If in Step 2 above adversaries have the option of learning ''f<sup>\u22121</sup>(X)'' instead of ''f(X)'' (but still have only small advantages) then ''E'' is a ''strong'' PRP (SPRP). An adversary is ''non-adaptive'' if it chooses all ''q'' values for ''X'' before the game begins (that is, it does not use any information gleaned from previous queries to choose each ''X'' as it goes).\n\nThese definitions have proven useful for analyzing various modes of operation. For example, one can define a similar game for measuring the security of a block cipher-based encryption algorithm, and then try to show (through a [[Reduction (complexity)|reduction argument]]) that the probability of an adversary winning this new game is not much more than ''P<sub>E</sub>(A)'' for some ''A''. (The reduction typically provides limits on ''q'' and the running time of ''A''.) Equivalently, if ''P<sub>E</sub>(A)'' is small for all relevant ''A'', then no attacker has a significant probability of winning the new game. This formalizes the idea that the higher-level algorithm inherits the block cipher's security.\n\n===Ideal cipher model===\n{{expand section|date=April 2012}}\n\n==Practical evaluation==\nBlock ciphers may be evaluated according to multiple criteria in practice. Common factors include:{{sfn|Menezes|van Oorschot|Vanstone|1996|p=227}}<ref name=\"AESr2report\">{{citation|author1=James Nechvatal |author2=Elaine Barker |author3=Lawrence Bassham |author4=William Burr |author5=Morris Dworkin |author6=James Foti |author7=Edward Roback |title=Report on the Development of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)|publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)|date=October 2000|url=http://csrc.nist.gov/archive/aes/round2/r2report.pdf}}</ref>\n*Key parameters, such as its key size and block size, both of which provide an upper bound on the security of the cipher.\n*The ''estimated security level'', which is based on the confidence gained in the block cipher design after it has largely withstood major efforts in cryptanalysis over time, the design's mathematical soundness, and the existence of practical or certificational<ref>Attacks that show that the cipher does not perform as advertised (i.e., the level of difficulty involved in breaking it is lower than claimed), which are nevertheless of high enough complexity so that they are not practically achievable.</ref> attacks.\n*The cipher's ''complexity'' and its suitability for implementation in [[electronic hardware|hardware]] or [[software]].

A revised version of the algorithm was adopted as a U.S. government [[Federal Information Processing Standard]]: FIPS PUB 46 [[Data Encryption Standard]] (DES).<ref>[http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips46-3/fips46-3.pdf FIPS PUB 46-3 ''Data Encryption Standard (DES)''] (This is the third edition, 1999, but includes historical information in the preliminary section 12.)</ref> It was chosen by the U.S. National Bureau of Standards (NBS) after a public invitation for submissions and some internal changes by [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NBS]] (and, potentially, the [[NSA]]). DES was publicly released in 1976 and has been widely used.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nDES was designed to, among other things, resist a certain cryptanalytic attack known to the NSA and rediscovered by IBM, though unknown publicly until rediscovered again and published by [[Eli Biham]] and [[Adi Shamir]] in the late 1980s. The technique is called [[differential cryptanalysis]] and remains one of the few general attacks against block ciphers; [[linear cryptanalysis]] is another, but may have been unknown even to the NSA, prior to its publication by [[Mitsuru Matsui]]. DES prompted a large amount of other work and publications in cryptography and [[cryptanalysis]] in the open community and it inspired many new cipher designs.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nDES has a block size of 64 bits and a [[key size]] of 56 bits. 64-bit blocks became common in block cipher designs after DES. Key length depended on several factors, including government regulation. Many observers{{who|date=April 2012}} in the 1970s commented that the 56-bit key length used for DES was too short. As time went on, its inadequacy became apparent, especially after a [[EFF DES cracker|special purpose machine designed to break DES]] was demonstrated in 1998 by the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]]. An extension to DES, [[Triple DES]], triple-encrypts each block with either two independent keys (112-bit key and 80-bit security) or three independent keys (168-bit key and 112-bit security). It was widely adopted as a replacement. As of 2011, the three-key version is still considered secure, though the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) standards no longer permit the use of the two-key version in new applications, due to its 80-bit security level.<ref name=NIST_SP_800-57>[http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-57/sp800-57-Part1-revised2_Mar08-2007.pdf NIST Special Publication 800-57 ''Recommendation for Key Management \u2014 Part 1: General (Revised)'', March, 2007] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606050814/http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-57/sp800-57-Part1-revised2_Mar08-2007.pdf |date=June 6, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n===IDEA===\nThe ''[[International Data Encryption Algorithm]]'' (''IDEA'') is a block cipher designed by [[James Massey]] of [[ETH Zurich]] and [[Xuejia Lai]]; it was first described in 1991, as an intended replacement for DES.\n\nIDEA operates on 64-bit [[block size (cryptography)|blocks]] using a 128-bit key, and consists of a series of eight identical transformations (a ''round'') and an output transformation (the ''half-round''). The processes for encryption and decryption are similar. IDEA derives much of its security by interleaving operations from different [[group (mathematics)|groups]] \u2013 [[modular arithmetic|modular]] addition and multiplication, and bitwise ''[[exclusive or]] (XOR)'' \u2013 which are algebraically \"incompatible\" in some sense.\n\nThe designers analysed IDEA to measure its strength against [[differential cryptanalysis]] and concluded that it is immune under certain assumptions. No successful [[linear cryptanalysis|linear]] or algebraic weaknesses have been reported. {{As of|2012}}, the best attack which applies to all keys can break full 8.5-round IDEA using a narrow-bicliques attack about four times faster than brute force.\n\n===RC5===\n[[File:RC5 InfoBox Diagram.svg|thumb|160px|right|One round (two half-rounds) of the RC5 block cipher]]\n{{Main|RC5}}\nRC5 is a block cipher designed by [[Ron Rivest|Ronald Rivest]] in 1994 which, unlike many other ciphers, has a variable block size (32, 64 or 128 bits), key size (0 to 2040 bits) and number of rounds (0 to 255). The original suggested choice of parameters were a block size of 64 bits, a 128-bit key and 12 rounds.\n\nA key feature of RC5 is the use of data-dependent rotations; one of the goals of RC5 was to prompt the study and evaluation of such operations as a cryptographic primitive. RC5 also consists of a number of [[modular arithmetic|modular]] additions and XORs. The general structure of the algorithm is a [[Feistel cipher|Feistel]]-like network. The encryption and decryption routines can be specified in a few lines of code. The key schedule, however, is more complex, expanding the key using an essentially [[one-way function]] with the binary expansions of both [[e (mathematical constant)|e]] and the [[golden ratio]] as sources of \"[[nothing up my sleeve number]]s\". The tantalising simplicity of the algorithm together with the novelty of the data-dependent rotations has made RC5 an attractive object of study for cryptanalysts.\n\n12-round RC5 (with 64-bit blocks) is susceptible to a [[differential cryptanalysis|differential attack]] using 2<sup>44</sup> chosen plaintexts.<ref name=\"Biryukov\">Biryukov A. and Kushilevitz E. (1998). Improved Cryptanalysis of RC5. EUROCRYPT 1998.</ref> 18\u201320 rounds are suggested as sufficient protection.\n\n===Rijndael / AES===\n{{Main|Advanced Encryption Standard}}\nDES has been superseded as a United States Federal Standard by the AES, adopted by NIST in 2001 after a 5-year [[Advanced Encryption Standard process|public competition]]. The cipher was developed by two Belgian cryptographers, [[Joan Daemen]] and [[Vincent Rijmen]], and submitted under the name ''Rijndael''.\n\nAES has a fixed block size of 128 bits and a key size of 128, 192, or 256 bits, whereas Rijndael can be specified with block and key sizes in any multiple of 32 bits, with a minimum of 128 bits. The blocksize has a maximum of 256 bits, but the keysize has no theoretical maximum. AES operates on a 4\u00d74 [[column-major order]] matrix of bytes, termed the ''state'' (versions of Rijndael with a larger block size have additional columns in the state).\n\n===Blowfish===\n{{Main|Blowfish (cipher)}}\n''[[Blowfish (cipher)|Blowfish]]'' is a block cipher, designed in 1993 by [[Bruce Schneier]] and included in a large number of cipher suites and encryption products. Blowfish has a 64-bit block size and a variable [[key length]] from 1 bit up to 448 bits.<ref name=blowfish-paper>{{cite journal |author=[[Bruce Schneier]] |year=1993 |title=Description of a New Variable-Length Key, 64-Bit Block Cipher (Blowfish) |url=http://www.schneier.com/paper-blowfish-fse.html }}</ref> It is a 16-round [[Feistel cipher]] and uses large key-dependent [[Substitution box|S-boxes]]. Notable features of the design include the key-dependent [[S-box]]es and a highly complex [[key schedule]].\n\nSchneier designed Blowfish as a general-purpose algorithm, intended as an alternative to the ageing DES and free of the problems and constraints associated with other algorithms. At the time Blowfish was released, many other designs were proprietary, encumbered by [[patent]]s or were commercial/government secrets. Schneier has stated that, \"Blowfish is unpatented, and will remain so in all countries. The algorithm is hereby placed in the [[public domain]], and can be freely used by anyone.\" Blowfish provides a good encryption rate in software and no effective [[cryptanalysis]] of the full-round version has been found to date.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\n==Generalizations==\n\n===Tweakable block ciphers===\n{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}\nM. Liskov, R. Rivest, and D. Wagner have described a generalized version of block ciphers called \"tweakable\" block ciphers.<ref name=\"tweak\">{{cite journal|authors=M. Liskov, R. Rivest, and D. Wagner|title=Tweakable Block Ciphers|journal=Crypto 2002|url=http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~jrblack/class/csci7000/f03/papers/tweak-crypto02.pdf}}</ref> A tweakable block cipher accepts a second input called the ''tweak'' along with its usual plaintext or ciphertext input. The tweak, along with the key, selects the permutation computed by the cipher. If changing tweaks is sufficiently lightweight (compared with a usually fairly expensive key setup operation), then some interesting new operation modes become possible. The [[disk encryption theory]] article describes some of these modes.\n\n===Format-preserving encryption===\n{{Main|Format-preserving encryption}}\nBlock ciphers traditionally work over a binary [[Alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]]. That is, both the input and the output are binary strings, consisting of ''n'' zeroes and ones. In some situations, however, one may wish to have a block cipher that works over some other alphabet; for example, encrypting 16-digit credit card numbers in such a way that the ciphertext is also a 16-digit number might facilitate adding an encryption layer to legacy software. This is an example of ''format-preserving encryption''. More generally, format-preserving encryption requires a keyed permutation on some finite [[Formal language|language]]. This makes format-preserving encryption schemes a natural generalization of (tweakable) block ciphers. In contrast, traditional encryption schemes, such as CBC, are not permutations because the same plaintext can encrypt to multiple different ciphertexts, even when using a fixed key.\n\n==Relation to other cryptographic primitives==\nBlock ciphers can be used to build other cryptographic primitives, such as those below. For these other primitives to be cryptographically secure, care has to be taken to build them the right way.\n\n* [[Stream cipher]]s can be built using block ciphers. OFB-mode and CTR mode are block modes that turn a block cipher into a stream cipher.\n* [[Cryptographic hash function]]s can be built using block ciphers.<ref>[http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=44737 ISO/IEC 10118-2:2010 ''Information technology \u2014 Security techniques \u2014 Hash-functions \u2014 Part 2: Hash-functions using an n-bit block cipher'']</ref>{{sfn|Menezes|van Oorschot|Vanstone|1996|loc=Chapter 9: Hash Functions and Data Integrity}} See [[one-way compression function]] for descriptions of several such methods. The methods resemble the block cipher modes of operation usually used for encryption.\n* [[Cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator]]s (CSPRNGs) can be built using block ciphers.<ref>[http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-90A/SP800-90A.pdf NIST Special Publication 800-90A ''Recommendation for Random Number Generation Using Deterministic Random Bit Generators'']</ref>{{sfn|Menezes|van Oorschot|Vanstone|1996|loc=Chapter 5: Pseudorandom Bits and Sequences}}\n* Secure [[pseudorandom permutation]]s of arbitrarily sized finite sets can be constructed with block ciphers; see [[Format-Preserving Encryption]].\n* [[Message authentication code]]s (MACs) are often built from block ciphers. [[CBC-MAC]], [[One-key MAC|OMAC]] and [[PMAC (cryptography)|PMAC]] are such MACs.\n* [[Authenticated encryption]] is also built from block ciphers. It means to both encrypt and MAC at the same time. That is to both provide [[confidentiality]] and [[authentication]]. [[CCM mode|CCM]], [[EAX mode|EAX]], [[Galois/Counter Mode|GCM]] and [[OCB mode|OCB]] are such authenticated encryption modes.\n\nJust as block ciphers can be used to build hash functions, hash functions can be used to build block ciphers. Examples of such block ciphers are [[SHACAL]], [[BEAR and LION ciphers|BEAR and LION]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Cryptography}}\n*[[Cipher security summary]]\n*[[Topics in cryptography]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book|first1=Lars R. |last1=Knudsen |first2=Matthew |last2=Robshaw |title=The Block Cipher Companion|publisher=Springer|year=2011|isbn=9783642173417|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YiZKt_FcmYQC}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.users.zetnet.co.uk/hopwood/crypto/scan/cs.html A list of many symmetric algorithms, the majority of which are block ciphers.]\n* [http://www.mat.dtu.dk/people/Lars.R.Knudsen/bc.html The block cipher lounge]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070306055504/http://www.rsa.com/rsalabs/node.asp?id=2168 What is a block cipher?] from RSA [[FAQ]]\n\n{{Cryptography navbox|block}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Block Cipher}}\n[[Category:Block ciphers|*]]\n[[Category:Cryptographic primitives]]", "sha1": "9ub9tgus31rloy8gxxdgi5eo1xa6hb6"}}, {"title": "Wireless broadband", "ns": "0", "id": "4595", "revision": {"id": "862180974", "parentid": "862180942", "timestamp": "2018-10-02T17:46:23Z", "contributor": {"ip": "159.153.60.73"}, "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{about|wireless networking in general|local area network technologies|Wireless LAN}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=March 2011}}\n\n[[File:Dishes ft worth2.JPG|thumb |right |upright=1.3 |Three [[fixed wireless]] dishes with protective covers on top of 307 W. 7th Street, [[Fort Worth, Texas]] around 2001]]\n\n'''Wireless broadband''' is telecommunications technology that provides high-speed [[wireless]] [[Internet access]] or [[computer network]]ing access over a wide area.

To receive this type of Internet connection, consumers mount a small [[Parabolic antenna|dish]] to the roof of their home or office and point it to the transmitter. [[Line-of-sight propagation|Line of sight]] is usually necessary for WISPs operating in the [[IEEE 802.11|2.4 and 5 GHz]] bands with 900&nbsp;MHz offering better [[NLOS]] (non-line-of-sight) performance.\n\n===Residential Wireless Internet===\nProviders of fixed wireless broadband services typically provide equipment to customers and install a small antenna or dish somewhere on the roof. This equipment is usually deployed as a service and maintained by the company providing that service. Fixed wireless services have become particularly popular in many rural areas where Cable, DSL or other typical home Internet services are not available.\n\n===Business Wireless Internet===\nMany companies in the US and worldwide have started using wireless alternatives to incumbent and local providers for internet and voice service. These providers tend to offer competitive services and options in areas where there is a difficulty getting affordable Ethernet connections from terrestrial providers such as ATT, Comcast, Verizon and others. Also, companies looking for full diversity between carriers for critical uptime requirements may seek wireless alternatives to local options.\n\n===Demand for spectrum===\n{{Main|Spectrum reallocation}}\nTo cope with increased demand for wireless broadband, increased [[Radio spectrum|spectrum]] would be needed. Studies began in 2009, and while some unused spectrum was available, it appeared broadcasters would have to give up at least some spectrum. This led to strong objections from the broadcasting community. In 2013, auctions were planned, and for now any action by broadcasters is voluntary.\n\n==Mobile wireless broadband==\nCalled [[mobile broadband]], wireless broadband technologies include services from [[mobile phone]] service providers such as [[Verizon Wireless]], [[Sprint Corporation]], and [[AT&T Mobility]],and T-Mobile  which allow a more mobile version of Internet access. Consumers can purchase a [[PC card]], laptop card, or [[USB]] equipment to connect their PC or laptop to the Internet via [[cell phone tower]]s. This type of connection would be stable in almost any area that could also receive a strong cell phone connection. These connections can cost more for portable convenience as well as having speed limitations in all but urban environments.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\nOn June 2, 2010, after months of discussion,  AT&T became the first wireless Internet provider in the USA to announce plans to charge according to usage. As the only [[iPhone]] service in the United States, AT&T experienced the problem of heavy Internet use more than other providers. About 3 percent of AT&T [[Smartphone|smart phone]] customers account for 40 percent of the technology's use. 98 percent of the company's customers use less than 2 [[gigabyte]]s (4000 page views, 10,000 emails or 200 minutes of [[Streaming media|streaming video]]), the limit under the $25 monthly plan, and 65 percent use less than 200 [[megabyte]]s, the limit for the $15 plan. For each gigabyte in excess of the limit, customers would be charged $10 a month starting June 7, 2010, though existing customers would not be required to change from the $30 a month unlimited service plan. The new plan would become a requirement for those upgrading to the new iPhone technology later in the summer.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thesunnews.com/2010/06/03/1509693/att-first-carrier-to-end-unlimited.html |title=AT&T first carrier to end unlimited data plans |last=Bartash |first=Jeffrey|work=[[MarketWatch]]|date=June 3, 2010|accessdate=2010-06-03}}</ref>\n\n==Licensing==\n\nA wireless connection can be either licensed or unlicensed. In the [[United States|U.S.]], licensed connections use a private [[Electromagnetic spectrum|spectrum]] the user has secured rights to from the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC). In other countries, spectrum is licensed from the country's national radio communications authority (such as the [[Australian Communications and Media Authority|ACMA]] in [[Australia]] or [[Nigerian Communications Commission]] in [[Nigeria]] (NCC)). Licensing is usually expensive and often reserved for large companies who wish to guarantee private access to spectrum for use in point to point communication. Because of this, most wireless ISP's use [[unlicensed spectrum]] which is publicly shared.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Clearwire]]\n* [[CorDECT]]\n* [[HIPERMAN]]\n* [[Skyriver]], provider in California\n*

Borg then won 19 straight points on serve in the deciding set and prevailed after 3 hours, 53 minutes.<ref name=\"aftonbladet.se1\" /> Borg himself commented years later that this was the first time that he was afraid that he would lose, as well as feeling that it was the beginning of the end of his dominance.<ref name=\"sverigesradio\" /><ref name=\"Observer 2007-01-07\">{{cite news |first=Tim |last=Adams |title='I can't explain except to say I wanted to play again.

With 19,103 fans in attendance, Borg won a deciding third-set tie-break for the second year in a row. Borg then defeated [[Ivan Lendl]] for his second Masters title.<ref name=\"sverigesradio\" />\n\n===1981 \u2013 Sixth and final French Open title===\nBorg won his last Grand Slam title at the French Open in [[1981 French Open \u2013 Men's Singles|1981]], defeating Lendl in a five-set final. Borg's six French Open Grand Slam titles was a record bettered only by [[Rafael Nadal]] in 2012.\n\nIn reaching the Wimbledon final in [[1981 Wimbledon Championships \u2013 Men's Singles|1981]], Borg stretched his winning streak at the [[All England Club]] to a record 41 matches. In a semifinal, Borg was down to Connors by two sets to love, before coming back to win the match. However, Borg's streak was brought to an end by McEnroe, who defeated him in four sets. Years afterward, Borg remarked \"And when I lost what shocked me was I wasn't even upset. That was not me: losing a Wimbledon final and not upset. I hate to lose.\" Borg around that time felt that his desire to play was gone, despite McEnroe's desperate efforts to persuade him not to retire and continue their rivalry.<ref name=\"Observer 2007-01-07\"/>\n\nBorg went on to lose to McEnroe at the [[1981 US Open \u2013 Men's Singles|1981]] US Open. After that defeat, Borg walked off the court and out of the stadium before the ceremonies and press conference had begun, and headed straight for the airport.<ref name=\"sverigesradio\" /><ref name=\"Observer 2007-01-07\" /> There are reports that Borg received threats after his semifinal win over Connors. In later years, Borg apologized to McEnroe. The 1981 US Open would be the Swede's last Grand Slam final. Major tournaments and tour organizers were enforcing a new rule; by 1982, that players had to play at least 10 official tournaments per year. However, Borg wanted to curtail his schedule after many years of winning so often. Although he felt in good condition physically, he recognized that the relentless drive to win and defy tour organizers had begun to fade.<ref name=\"Observer 2007-01-07\"/>\n\nBorg failed to win the US Open in 10 tries, losing four finals, [[1976 US Open \u2013 Men's Singles|1976]] and [[1978 US Open \u2013 Men's Singles|1978]] to [[Jimmy Connors]], and [[1980 US Open \u2013 Men's Singles|1980]] and [[1981 US Open \u2013 Men's Singles|1981]] to John McEnroe. He played on hard courts at the US Open from 1978 to 1981 and reached the final there on three occasions, in 1978, 1980 and 1981. He led 3\u20132 in the fifth set of the 1980 final, before losing. That match followed Borg's classic encounter with McEnroe at the 1980 Wimbledon. In 1978, 1979 and 1980, Borg was halfway to a Grand Slam after victories at the French and Wimbledon (the Australian Open being the last Grand Slam tournament of each year at the time) only to falter at Flushing Meadow, lefty Tanner his conqueror in 1979.\n\nIn 1982, Borg played only one tournament, losing to [[Yannick Noah]] in the quarterfinals of [[Monte Carlo Masters|Monte Carlo]] in April. Nevertheless, Borg's announcement in January 1983 that he was retiring from the game at the age of 26 was a shock to the tennis world. McEnroe tried unsuccessfully to persuade Borg to continue. He did, however, play Monte Carlo again in March 1983, reaching the second round, and Stuttgart in July 1984.\n\n===Retirement===\n[[File:Bj\u00f6rn Borg2.jpg|right|thumb|Borg in 1991]]\nUpon retirement, Borg had three residences, a penthouse in Monte Carlo, not far from his [[pro shop]], a mansion on Long Island, New York and a small island off the Swedish coast.\n\nBorg later bounced back as the owner of the Bj\u00f6rn Borg fashion label. In Sweden his label has become very successful, second only to [[Calvin Klein]].<ref name=\"Observer 2007-01-07\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bjornborg.com/en/ |title=Index of /en |publisher=Bjornborg.com |date=27 October 2010 |accessdate=20 April 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Failed comeback===\nFrom 1991\u20131993, Borg attempted a comeback on the men's professional tennis tour, coached by a Welsh karate expert named Ron Thatcher (aka Tai Honsai). Before his 1991 return, Borg grew his hair out as it had been during his previous professional tennis career and he returned to using a wooden racket; he had kept his hair cut and used modern graphite rackets in exhibitions he played during the late 1980s. Borg, however, failed to win a single match. He faced [[Jordi Arrese]] in his first match back, again at Monte Carlo but without practising or playing any exhibition matches, and fell in two sets. In his first nine matches, played in 1991 and 1992, Borg failed to win a single set. He fared slightly better in 1993, taking a set off his opponent in each of the three matches he played. He came closest to getting a win in what turned out to be his final tour match, falling to [[Alexander Volkov (tennis)|Alexander Volkov]].\n\nIn 1992 Borg, aged 35, using a graphite racket, defeated [[John Lloyd (tennis)|John Lloyd]], 37, at the Inglewood Forum Tennis Challenge. Borg later joined the Champions tour, returning to shorter hair and using modern rackets.\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Bj\u00f6rn Borg and Mariana Simionescu 1980.jpg|thumb|Borg and Simionescu in [[Snagov]], Romania, on 24 July 1980]]\nBorg married Romanian tennis pro [[Mariana Simionescu]] in [[Bucharest]] on 24 July 1980.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article125612212 |title=TENNIS Bjorn Borg weds in Bucharest |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |volume=54, |issue=16,374 |date=25 July 1980 |page=18 |via=[[National Library of Australia]]}}</ref> The marriage ended in divorce in 1984.

Borg also never won the Australian Open, as he only played in the event once, in 1974 as a 17-year-old. The only players to defeat Borg in a Grand Slam final were fellow World No. 1 tennis players [[John McEnroe]] and [[Jimmy Connors]]. Even though it was then played on grass, a surface where he enjoyed much success, Borg chose to play the Australian Open only once, in 1974, where he lost in the third round. [[Phil Dent]], a contemporary of Borg, has pointed out that skipping Grand Slam tournaments\u2014especially the Australian Open\u2014was not unusual then, before counting Grand Slam titles became the norm.<ref>{{cite web |author=Bonnie DeSimoneArchive |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/french07/columns/story?columnist=desimone_bonnie&id=2882705 |title=Chris Evert owned Roland Garros like no other |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=26 May 2007 |accessdate=20 April 2012}}</ref> Additionally, another contemporary [[Arthur Ashe]] told ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', \"I think Bjorn could have won the U.S. Open.

His highly unorthodox backhand involved taking his racket back with both hands but actually generating his power with his dominant right hand, letting go of the grip with his left hand around point of contact, and following through with his swing as a one-hander.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20150703004013/http://www.slagproffset.se/Tennisboken/Analys%20av%20bra%20spelares%20teknik%20-%20del%20II/Servetekniken%20hos%20en%20rekordh%C3%A5llare.html Aanalys av bra spelares teknik \u2013 Slagproffset] Retrieved 2 July 2015</ref> He hit the ball hard and high from the back of the court and brought it down with considerable [[topspin]], which made his ground strokes very consistent.<ref name=bbc_legends>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/wimbledon_history/3742099.stm |title=Wimbledon legends: Bjorn Borg |accessdate=20 January 2009 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=31 May 2004}}</ref> There had been other players, particularly [[Rod Laver]] and [[Arthur Ashe]], who played with topspin on both the forehand and backhand, yet Laver and Ashe used topspin only as a way to mix up their shots to pass their opponents at the net easily.

Both of these factors allowed Borg to be dominant at the French Open.<ref name=\"dn.se\">{{cite web |url=http://www.dn.se/sport/johan-esk-han-ar-solklar-etta-pa-150-listan/ |title=Johan Esk: Han \u00e4r solklar etta p\u00e5 150-listan |work=DN.SE |accessdate=2 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nOne of the factors that made Borg unique was his dominance on the grass courts of Wimbledon, where baseliners since World War II did not usually succeed. Some experts attributed his dominance on this surface to his consistency, an underrated serve, equally underrated volleys, and his adaptation to grass courts. Against the best players, he almost always served-and-volleyed on his first serves (but he naturally played from the baseline after his second serves).<ref name=\"dn.se\" /><ref name=\"aftonbladet.se\">{{cite web |url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/sportbladet/tennis/article19119729.ab |title=St\u00f6rsta \u00f6gonblicket i idrottshistorien... |work=Aftonbladet |accessdate=2 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nAnother trait usually associated with Borg is his grace under pressure.

He could outlast most of his opponents under the most grueling conditions. Contrary to popular belief, however, this wasn't due to his exceptionally low resting heart rate, often reported to be near 35 beats per minute. In his introduction to Borg's autobiography ''My Life and Game'', Eugene Scott relates that this rumor arose from a medical exam the 18-year-old Borg once took for military service, where his pulse was recorded as 38. Scott goes on to reveal Borg's true pulse rate as \"about 50 when he wakes up and around 60 in the afternoon.\"<ref>Borg, Bj\u00f6rn, and Eugene L. Scott.

Sutter has attempted to list all tournaments meeting his criteria for selection beginning with 1946 and ending in the fall of 1991. For each tournament, he has indicated the city, the date of the final, the winner, the runner-up, and the score of the final. A tournament is included in his list if: (1) the draw for the tournament included at least eight players (with a few exceptions, such as the Pepsi Grand Slam tournaments in the second half of the 1970s which included only players that had won a Grand Slam tournament); and (2) the level of the tournaments was at least equal to the present day challenger tournaments. Sutter's book is probably the most exhaustive source of tennis tournament information since World War II, even though some professional tournaments held before the start of the open era are missing. Later, Sutter issued a second edition of his book, with only the players, their wins, and years for the 1946 through 27 April 2003, period.\n\n==Video==\n* ''The Wimbledon Collection \u2013 Legends of Wimbledon \u2013 Bjorn Borg'' Standing Room Only, DVD Release Date: 21 September 2004, Run Time: 52 minutes, ASIN: B0002HODA4.\n* ''The Wimbledon Collection \u2013 The Classic Match \u2013 Borg vs. McEnroe 1981 Final'' Standing Room Only, DVD Release Date: 21 September 2004, Run Time: 210 minutes, ASIN: B0002HODAE.\n* ''The Wimbledon Collection \u2013 The Classic Match \u2013 Borg vs. McEnroe 1980 Final'' Standing Room Only, DVD Release Date: 21 September 2004, Run Time: 240 minutes; ASIN: B0002HOEK8.\n* ''Wimbledon Classic Match: Gerulaitis vs Borg'' Standing Room Only, DVD Release Date: 31 October 2006, Run Time: 180 minutes, ASIN: B000ICLR8O.\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|Bj\u00f6rn Borg}}\n* {{ATP}}\n* {{ITF}}\n* {{Davis Cup player}}\n* {{Tennis Hall of Fame}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110203182757/http://www.wimbledon.org/en_GB/about/history/bjorn_borg.html Official Wimbledon website profile]\n* [http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/tennis/wimbledon_history/3742099.stm BBC profile]\n* [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/tennis/article6637160.ece Sunday Times article 5 July 2009]\n* [https://www.bjornborg.com/ Bj\u00f6rn Borg (brand)]\n\n{{Bj\u00f6rn Borg start boxes}}\n{{navboxes|title=Bj\u00f6rn Borg in [[grand slam (tennis)|Grand Slam tournaments]]\n| list1=\n{{Men's tennis players who won two or more Grand Slam singles titles in one calendar year}}\n{{Wimbledon boys' singles champions}}\n{{French Open men's singles champions}}\n{{Wimbledon men's singles champions}}\n}}\n{{navboxes|title=Bj\u00f6rn Borg's [[Bj\u00f6rn Borg career statistics|achievements]]\n| list1=\n{{Tennis World Number Ones (men)}}\n{{Year-End Championships winners}}\n{{WCT Year-End Championships winners}}\n}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Borg, Bjorn}}\n[[Category:French Open champions]]\n[[Category:International Tennis Hall of Fame inductees]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:People from Monte Carlo]]\n[[Category:People from S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje]]\n[[Category:Sportspeople from Stockholm]]\n[[Category:Swedish expatriates in Monaco]]\n[[Category:Swedish male tennis players]]\n[[Category:Wimbledon champions]]\n[[Category:Wimbledon junior champions]]\n[[Category:World No. 1 tennis players]]\n[[Category:1956 births]]\n[[Category:Grand Slam (tennis) champions in men's singles]]", "sha1": "631uz1jeo2ran1dtt48hg3w8exthym9"}}, {"title": "Booch method", "ns": "0", "id": "4603", "revision": {"id": "853272865", "parentid": "853217772", "timestamp": "2018-08-03T15:42:59Z", "contributor": {"username": "72", "id": "28970402"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Reverted edits by [[Special:Contribs/202.53.87.74|202.53.87.74]] ([[User talk:202.53.87.74|talk]]) to last version by 73.189.240.68", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "[[Image:Booch-diagram.png|thumb|250px|Class diagram]]\n\nThe '''Booch method'''<ref name=\"book\">{{cite book\n | first = Grady\n | last = Booch\n | authorlink = Grady Booch\n | year = 1993\n | title = Object-oriented Analysis and Design with Applications\n | edition = 2nd\n |  location= Redwood City | publisher=Benjamin Cummings\n | isbn = 0-8053-5340-2\n}}</ref> is a method for object-oriented software development.

The battle was the climax of a [[Mediterranean campaign of 1798|naval campaign]] that had raged across the Mediterranean during the previous three months, as a large French convoy sailed from [[Toulon]] to [[Alexandria]] carrying an expeditionary force under General [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]. The British fleet was led in the battle by Rear-Admiral Sir [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Horatio Nelson]]; they decisively defeated the French under Vice-Admiral [[Fran\u00e7ois-Paul Brueys d'Aigalliers]].\n\nBonaparte sought to invade Egypt as the first step in a campaign against [[British India]], part of a greater effort to drive Britain out of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]]. As Bonaparte's fleet crossed the Mediterranean, it was pursued by a British force under Nelson who had been sent from the British fleet in the [[Tagus]] to learn the purpose of the French expedition and to defeat it. He chased the French for more than two months, on several occasions missing them only by a matter of hours. Bonaparte was aware of Nelson's pursuit and enforced absolute secrecy about his destination. He was able to capture [[Malta]] and then land in Egypt without interception by the British naval forces.\n\nWith the French army ashore, the French fleet anchored in Aboukir Bay, {{convert|20|mi|km}} northeast of Alexandria. Commander Vice-Admiral Fran\u00e7ois-Paul Brueys d'Aigalliers believed that he had established a formidable defensive position. The British fleet arrived off Egypt on 1 August and discovered Brueys's dispositions, and Nelson ordered an immediate attack. His ships advanced on the French line and split into two divisions as they approached. One cut across the head of the line and passed between the anchored French and the shore, while the other engaged the seaward side of the French fleet.\n\nTrapped in a crossfire, the leading French warships were battered into surrender during a fierce three-hour battle, while the centre succeeded in repelling the initial British attack. As British reinforcements arrived, the centre came under renewed assault and, at 22:00, the French flagship [[French ship Orient (1791)|''Orient'']] exploded. The rear division of the French fleet attempted to break out of the bay, with Brueys dead and his [[vanguard]] and centre defeated, but only two [[ships of the line]] and two [[frigate]]s escaped from a total of 17 ships engaged.\n\nThe battle reversed the strategic situation between the two nations' forces in the Mediterranean and entrenched the Royal Navy in the dominant position that it retained for the rest of the war. It also encouraged other European countries to turn against France, and was a factor in the outbreak of the [[War of the Second Coalition]]. Bonaparte's army was trapped in Egypt, and Royal Navy dominance off the Syrian coast contributed significantly to the French defeat at the [[Siege of Acre (1799)|Siege of Acre]] in 1799 which preceded Bonaparte's return to Europe. Nelson had been wounded in the battle, and he was proclaimed a hero across Europe and was subsequently made [[Baron Nelson]]\u2014although he was privately dissatisfied with his rewards. His captains were also highly praised and went on to form the nucleus of the legendary [[Nelson's Band of Brothers]]. The legend of the battle has remained prominent in the popular consciousness, with perhaps the best-known representation being [[Felicia Hemans]]' 1826 poem ''[[Casabianca (poem)|Casabianca]]''.\n\n==Background==\n[[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s victories in northern Italy over the [[Austrian Empire]] helped secure victory for the French in the [[War of the First Coalition]] in 1797, and Great Britain remained the only major European power still at war with the [[French First Republic|French Republic]].<ref name=\"SM224\">[[#Reference-Maffeo|Maffeo, p. 224]]</ref> The [[French Directory]] investigated a number of strategic options to counter British opposition, including projected invasions of Ireland and Britain and the expansion of the [[French Navy]] to challenge the [[Royal Navy]] at sea.<ref name=\"WJ113\">[[#Reference-James|James, p. 113]]</ref> Despite significant efforts, British control of Northern European waters rendered these ambitions impractical in the short term,<ref name=\"PP116\">[[#Reference-Padfield|Padfield, p. 116]]</ref> and the Royal Navy remained firmly in control of the Atlantic Ocean. However, the French navy was dominant in the Mediterranean, following the withdrawal of the British fleet after the outbreak of war between Britain and Spain in 1796.<ref name=\"JK36\">[[#Reference-Keegan|Keegan, p. 36]]</ref> This allowed Bonaparte to propose an [[Napoleonic Campaign in Egypt|invasion of Egypt]] as an alternative to confronting Britain directly, believing that the British would be too distracted by an imminent [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|Irish uprising]] to intervene in the Mediterranean.<ref name=\"JHR141\">[[#Reference-Rose|Rose, p. 141]]</ref>\n\nBonaparte believed that, by establishing a permanent presence in Egypt (nominally part of the neutral [[Ottoman Empire]]), the French would obtain a staging point for future operations against [[British India]], possibly in conjunction with the [[Tipu Sultan]] of [[Seringapatam]], that might successfully drive the British out of the war.<ref name=\"RLA7\">[[#Reference-Adkins|Adkins, p. 7]]</ref> The campaign would sever the chain of communication that connected Britain with India, an essential part of the [[British Empire]] whose trade generated the wealth that Britain required to prosecute the war successfully.<ref name=\"SM230\">[[#Reference-Maffeo|Maffeo, p. 230]]</ref> The French Directory agreed with Bonaparte's plans, although a major factor in their decision was a desire to see the politically ambitious Bonaparte and the fiercely loyal veterans of his Italian campaigns travel as far from France as possible.<ref name=\"NR457\">[[#Reference-Rodger|Rodger, p. 457]]</ref> During the spring of 1798, Bonaparte assembled more than 35,000 soldiers in Mediterranean France and Italy and developed a powerful fleet at [[Toulon]].

Alarmed by reports of French preparations on the Mediterranean coast, [[George Spencer, 2nd Earl Spencer|Lord Spencer]] at the [[Admiralty]] sent a message to Vice-Admiral [[John Jervis, 1st Earl of St Vincent|Earl St. Vincent]], commander of the Mediterranean Fleet based in the [[Tagus River]], to despatch a squadron to investigate.<ref name=\"SM233\">[[#Reference-Maffeo|Maffeo, p. 233]]</ref> This squadron, consisting of three [[Ship of the line|ships of the line]] and three [[frigates]], was entrusted to Rear-Admiral Sir Horatio Nelson.\n\nNelson was a highly experienced officer who had been blinded in one eye during fighting in [[Corsica]] in 1794 and subsequently commended for his capture of two Spanish [[ships of the line]] at the [[Battle of Cape St. Vincent (1797)|Battle of Cape St. Vincent]] in February 1797.

Bonaparte had ordered the fleet to anchor in Aboukir Bay, a shallow and exposed anchorage, but had supplemented the orders with the suggestion that, if Aboukir Bay was too dangerous, Brueys could sail north to [[Corfu]], leaving only the transports and a handful of lighter warships at Alexandria.<ref name=\"JHR142\">[[#Reference-Rose|Rose, p. 142]]</ref> Brueys refused, in the belief that his squadron could provide essential support to the French army on shore, and called his captains aboard his 120-gun flagship ''[[French ship Orient (1791)|Orient]]'' to discuss their response should Nelson discover the fleet in its anchorage. Despite vocal opposition from [[Contre-amiral]] [[Armand Blanquet]],<ref name=\"EB199\">[[#Reference-Bradford|Bradford, p. 199]]</ref>  who insisted that the fleet would be best able to respond in open water, the rest of the captains agreed that anchoring in a [[line of battle]] inside the bay presented the strongest tactic for confronting Nelson.<ref name=\"WJ159\">[[#Reference-James|James, p. 159]]</ref> It is possible that Bonaparte envisaged Aboukir Bay as a temporary anchorage: on 27 July, he expressed the expectation that Brueys had already transferred his ships to Alexandria, and three days later, he issued orders for the fleet to make for Corfu in preparation for naval operations against the Ottoman territories in the Balkans,<ref name=\"JHR143\">[[#Reference-Rose|Rose, p. 143]]</ref> although [[Bedouin]] [[Irregular military|partisans]]<ref name=\"EB192\">[[#Reference-Bradford|Bradford, p. 192]]</ref> intercepted and killed the courier carrying the instructions.\n[[File:Fran\u00e7ois-Paul Brueys d'Aigalliers.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Fran\u00e7ois-Paul Brueys d'Aigalliers<br />artist unknown, [[Palace of Versailles]]|alt=A man in an ornate naval uniform with long grey hair stands on a ship's quarterdeck.]]\nAboukir Bay is a coastal indentation {{convert|16|nmi|km}} across, stretching from the village of [[Abu Qir]] in the west to the town of [[Rosetta]] to the east, where one of the mouths of the [[River Nile]] empties into the Mediterranean.<ref name=\"SM268\">[[#Reference-Maffeo|Maffeo, p.&nbsp;268\u2013269]]</ref> In 1798, the bay was protected at its western end by extensive rocky [[shoal]]s which ran {{convert|3|mi|km}} into the bay from a [[promontory]] guarded by Aboukir Castle. A small fort situated on [[Nelson's Island|an island]] among the rocks protected the shoals.<ref name=\"WLC357\">[[#Reference-Clowes|Clowes, p. 357]]</ref> The fort was garrisoned by French soldiers and armed with at least four cannon and two heavy [[mortar (weapon)|mortars]].<ref name=\"WJ160\">[[#Reference-James|James, p. 160]]</ref> Brueys had augmented the fort with his [[bomb vessel]]s and [[gunboat]]s, anchored among the rocks to the west of the island in a position to give support to the head of the French line. Further shoals ran unevenly to the south of the island and extended across the bay in a rough semicircle approximately {{convert|1650|yd|m}} from the shore.<ref name=\"WLC358\">[[#Reference-Clowes|Clowes, p. 358]]</ref> These shoals were too shallow to permit the passage of larger warships, and so Brueys ordered his thirteen ships of the line to form up in a line of battle following the northeastern edge of the shoals to the south of the island, a position that allowed the ships to disembark supplies from their port sides while covering the landings with their starboard batteries.<ref name=\"RG31\">[[#Reference-Gardiner|Gardiner, p. 31]]</ref> Orders were issued for each ship to attach strong cables to the bow and stern of their neighbours, which would effectively turn the line into a long battery forming a theoretically impregnable barrier.<ref name=\"OW66\">[[#Reference-Warner|Warner, p. 66]]</ref> Brueys positioned a second, inner line of four frigates approximately {{convert|350|yd|m}} west of the main line, roughly halfway between the line and the shoal. The van of the French line was led by ''[[French ship Guerrier (1754)|Guerrier]]'', positioned {{convert|2400|yd|m}} southeast of Aboukir Island and about {{convert|1000|yd|m}} from the edge of the shoals that surrounded the island.<ref name=\"WJ160\"/> The line stretched southeast, with the centre bowed seawards away from the shoal. The French ships were spaced at intervals of {{convert|160|yd|m}} and the whole line was {{convert|2850|yd|m}} long,<ref name=\"WLC359\">[[#Reference-Clowes|Clowes, p. 359]]</ref> with the flagship ''Orient'' at the centre and two large 80-gun ships anchored on either side.<ref name=\"NM260\">[[#Reference-Mostert|Mostert, p. 260]]</ref> The rear division of the line was under the command of Contre-amiral [[Pierre-Charles Villeneuve]] in ''[[French ship Guillaume Tell (1795)|Guillaume Tell]]''.<ref name=\"WJ160\"/>\n\nIn deploying his ships in this way, Brueys hoped that the British would be forced by the shoals to attack his strong centre and rear, allowing his van to use the prevailing northeasterly wind to counterattack the British once they were engaged.<ref name=\"PP120\">[[#Reference-Padfield|Padfield, p. 120]]</ref> However, he had made a serious misjudgement: he had left enough room between ''Guerrier'' and the shoals for an enemy ship to cut across the head of the French line and proceed between the shoals and the French ships, allowing the unsupported vanguard to be caught in a crossfire by two divisions of enemy ships.<ref name=\"RLA24\"/>  Compounding this error, the French only prepared their ships for battle on their starboard (seaward) sides, from which they expected the attack would have to come; their landward port sides were unprepared.<ref>George A. Henty, ''At Aboukir and Acre: A Story of Napoleon's Invasion of Egypt'', Fireship Press, 2008, p. 295.</ref>\nThe port side gun ports were closed, and the decks on that side were uncleared, with various stored items blocking access to the guns.<ref>R.G. Grant, ''Battle at Sea: 3,000 Years of Naval Warfare'', DK Publications, 2011, p. 180.</ref>  Brueys' dispositions had a second significant flaw: The 160-yard gaps between ships were large enough for a British ship to push through and break the French line.<ref name=\"RG13\">[[#Reference-Gardiner|Gardiner, p. 13]]</ref> Furthermore, not all of the French captains had followed Brueys' orders to attach cables to their neighbours' bow and stern, which would have prevented such a manoeuvre.<ref name=\"JK63\">[[#Reference-Keegan|Keegan, p. 63]]</ref> The problem was exacerbated by orders to only anchor at the bow, which allowed the ships to swing with the wind and widened the gaps. It also created areas within the French line not covered by the broadside of any ship. British vessels could anchor in those spaces and engage the French without reply. In addition, the deployment of Brueys' fleet prevented the rear from effectively supporting the van due to the prevailing winds.<ref name=\"WLC372\">[[#Reference-Clowes|Clowes, p. 372]]</ref>\n\nA more pressing problem for Brueys was a lack of food and water for the fleet: Bonaparte had unloaded almost all of the provisions carried aboard and no supplies were reaching the ships from the shore. To remedy this, Brueys sent foraging parties of 25 men from each ship along the coast to requisition food, dig wells, and collect water.<ref name=\"OW66\"/> Constant attacks by Bedouin partisans, however, required escorts of heavily armed guards for each party. Hence, up to a third of the fleet's sailors were away from their ships at any one time.<ref name=\"NM261\">[[#Reference-Mostert|Mostert, p. 261]]</ref> Brueys wrote a letter describing the situation to [[List of Naval Ministers of France|Minister of Marine]] [[\u00c9tienne Eustache Bruix]], reporting that \"Our crews are weak, both in number and quality.

The ships are firing on eight ships flying the British flag that are steadily approaching them from the right of the picture.]]\nAlthough initially disappointed that the main French fleet was not at Alexandria, Nelson knew from the presence of the transports that they must be nearby. At 14:00 on 1 August, lookouts on [[HMS Zealous (1785)|HMS ''Zealous'']] reported the French anchored in Aboukir Bay, its signal lieutenant just beating the lieutenant on [[HMS Goliath (1781)|HMS ''Goliath'']] with the signal, but inaccurately describing 16 French ships of the line instead of 13.<ref name=\"PP118\">[[#Reference-Padfield|Padfield, p. 118]]</ref> At the same time, French lookouts on ''[[French ship Heureux (1782)|Heureux]]'', the ninth ship in the French line, sighted the British fleet approximately  nine nautical miles off the mouth of Aboukir Bay. The French initially reported just 11 British ships \u2013 ''Swiftsure'' and ''Alexander'' were still returning from their scouting operations at Alexandria, and so were {{convert|3|nmi|km}} to the west of the main fleet, out of sight.<ref name=\"RLA23\">[[#Reference-Adkins|Adkins, p. 23]]</ref>  Troubridge's ship, [[HMS Culloden (1783)|HMS ''Culloden'']]'','' was also some distance from the main body, towing a captured merchant ship. At the sight of the French, Troubridge abandoned the vessel and made strenuous efforts to rejoin Nelson.<ref name=\"PP118\"/> Due to the need for so many sailors to work onshore, Brueys had not deployed any of his lighter warships as scouts, which left him unable to react swiftly to the sudden appearance of the British.<ref name=\"NR460\">[[#Reference-Rodger|Rodger, p. 460]]</ref>\n\nAs his ships readied for action, Brueys ordered his captains to gather for a conference on ''Orient'' and hastily recalled his shore parties, although most had still not returned by the start of the battle.<ref name=\"RLA23\" /> To replace them, large numbers of men were taken out of the frigates and distributed among the ships of the line.<ref name=\"WJ161\" /> Brueys also hoped to lure the British fleet onto the shoals at Aboukir Island, sending the brigs ''[[French brig Alerte (1787)|Alerte]]'' and ''Railleur'' to act as decoys in the shallow waters.<ref name=\"WLC359\" /> By 16:00, ''Alexander'' and ''Swiftsure'' were also in sight, although some distance from the main British fleet. Brueys gave orders to abandon the plan to remain at anchor and instead for his line to set sail.<ref name=\"NM265\">[[#Reference-Mostert|Mostert, p. 265]]</ref> Blanquet protested the order on the grounds that there were not enough men aboard the French ships to both sail the ships and man the guns.<ref name=\"OW72\">[[#Reference-Warner|Warner, p. 72]]</ref> Nelson gave orders for his leading ships to slow down, to allow the British fleet to approach in a more organised formation. This convinced Brueys that rather than risk an evening battle in confined waters, the British were planning to wait for the following day. He rescinded his earlier order to sail.<ref name=\"EB200\">[[#Reference-Bradford|Bradford, p. 200]]</ref>  Brueys may have been hoping that the delay would allow him to slip past the British during the night and thus follow Bonaparte's orders not to engage the British fleet directly if he could avoid it.<ref name=\"WJ161\">[[#Reference-James|James, p. 161]]</ref>\n\nNelson ordered the fleet to slow down at 16:00 to allow his ships to rig \"springs\" on their anchor cables, a system of attaching the bow anchor that increased stability and allowed his ships to swing their [[broadside]]s to face an enemy while stationary. It also increased manoeuvrability and therefore reduced the risk of coming under [[raking fire]].<ref name=\"WLC360\">[[#Reference-Clowes|Clowes, p. 360]]</ref> Nelson's plan, shaped through discussion with his senior captains during the return voyage to Alexandria,<ref name=\"SM268\" /> was to advance on the French and pass down the seaward side of the van and centre of the French line, so that each French ship would face two British ships and the massive ''Orient'' would be fighting against three.<ref name=\"WJ162\">[[#Reference-James|James, p. 162]]</ref> The direction of the wind meant that the French rear division would be unable to join the battle easily and would be cut off from the front portions of the line.<ref name=\"WJ165\" /> To ensure that in the smoke and confusion of a night battle his ships would not accidentally open fire on one another, Nelson ordered that each ship prepare four horizontal lights at the head of their [[mizzen]] mast and  hoist an illuminated [[White Ensign]], which was different enough from the [[French tricolour]] that it would not be mistaken in poor visibility, reducing the risk that British ships might fire on one another in the darkness.<ref name=\"WJ166\">[[#Reference-James|James, p. 166]]</ref> As his ship was readied for battle, Nelson held a final dinner with ''Vanguard''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s officers, announcing as he rose: \"Before this time tomorrow I shall have gained a [[peerage of the United Kingdom|peerage]] or [[Westminster Abbey]],\"<ref name=\"PP119\">[[#Reference-Padfield|Padfield, p. 119]]</ref> in reference to the rewards of victory or the traditional burial place of British military heroes.\n\n[[File:Pocock's Battle of the Nile.jpg|thumb|left|''The Battle of the Nile, 1 August 1798'', [[Nicholas Pocock]], 1808, [[National Maritime Museum]]|alt=A broad view of a bay.

To the right of the line a number of ships with all sails set are grouped around the head of the line, as smoke rises from many of the ships on both sides.]]\nShortly after the French order to set sail was abandoned, the British fleet began rapidly approaching once more. Brueys, now expecting to come under attack that night, ordered each of his ships to place springs on their anchor cables and prepare for action.<ref name=\"RLA23\"/> He sent the ''Alerte'' ahead, which passed close to the leading British ships and then steered sharply to the west over the shoal, in the hope that the ships of the line might follow and become grounded.<ref name=\"EB200\"/> None of Nelson's captains fell for the ruse and the British fleet continued undeterred.<ref name=\"WJ162\"/> At 17:30, Nelson hailed one of his two leading ships, HMS ''Zealous'' under Captain [[Sir Samuel Hood, 1st Baronet|Samuel Hood]], which had been racing ''Goliath'' to be the first to fire on the French. The admiral ordered Hood to establish the safest course into the harbour. The British had no charts of the depth or shape of the bay, except a rough sketch map ''Swiftsure'' had obtained from a merchant captain, an inaccurate British atlas on ''Zealous'',<ref name=\"SM269\">[[#Reference-Maffeo|Maffeo, p. 269]]</ref> and a 35-year-old French map aboard ''Goliath''.<ref name=\"RLA24\">[[#Reference-Adkins|Adkins, p. 24]]</ref> Hood replied that he would take careful [[Depth sounding|soundings]] as he advanced to test the depth of the water,<ref name=\"WLC361\">[[#Reference-Clowes|Clowes, p. 361]]</ref> and that, \"If you will allow the honour of leading you into battle, I will keep the lead going.\"<ref name=\"EB202\">[[#Reference-Bradford|Bradford, p. 202]]</ref> Shortly afterwards, Nelson paused to speak with the brig [[HMS Mutine (1797)|HMS ''Mutine'']], whose commander, Lieutenant [[Sir Thomas Hardy, 1st Baronet|Thomas Hardy]], had seized some [[maritime pilots]] from a small Alexandrine vessel.<ref name=\"PP123\">[[#Reference-Padfield|Padfield, p. 123]]</ref> As ''Vanguard'' came to a stop, the following ships slowed. This caused a gap to open up between ''Zealous'' and ''Goliath'' and the rest of the fleet.<ref name=\"RLA24\"/> To counter this effect, Nelson ordered [[HMS Theseus (1786)|HMS ''Theseus'']] under Captain [[Ralph Willett Miller|Ralph Miller]] to pass his flagship and join ''Zealous'' and ''Goliath'' in the vanguard.<ref name=\"WLC361\"/> By 18:00, the British fleet was again under full sail, ''Vanguard'' sixth in the line of ten ships as ''Culloden'' trailed behind to the north and  ''Alexander'' and ''Swiftsure'' hastened to catch up to the west.<ref name=\"WJ163\">[[#Reference-James|James, p. 163]]</ref> Following the rapid change from a loose formation to a rigid line of battle both fleets raised their colours; each British ship added additional [[Union Flag]]s in its rigging in case its main flag was shot away.<ref name=\"WJ164\">[[#Reference-James|James, p. 164]]</ref> At 18:20, as ''Goliath'' and ''Zealous'' rapidly bore down on them, the leading French ships ''Guerrier'' and ''[[French ship Conqu\u00e9rant (1747)|Conqu\u00e9rant]]'' opened fire.<ref name=\"RG33\">[[#Reference-Gardiner|Gardiner, p. 33]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Map Battle of the Nile 1798-en.png|thumb|350px|Map of ship positions and movements during the Battle of Aboukir Bay, 1\u20132 August 1798.

On his own initiative, Foley decided to exploit this tactical error and changed his angle of approach to sail through the gap.<ref name=\"EB202\"/> As the bow of ''Guerrier'' came within range, ''Goliath'' opened fire, inflicting severe damage with a double-shotted raking broadside as the British ship turned to port and passed down the unprepared port side of ''Guerrier.''<ref name=\"JK63\"/> Foley's [[Royal Marines]] and a company of Austrian [[grenadier]]s joined the attack, firing their muskets.<ref name=\"OW102\">[[#Reference-Warner|Warner, p. 102]]</ref> Foley had intended to anchor alongside the French ship and engage it closely, but his anchor took too long to descend and his ship passed ''Guerrier'' entirely.<ref name=\"NM266\">[[#Reference-Mostert|Mostert, p. 266]]</ref> ''Goliath'' eventually stopped close to the bow of ''Conqu\u00e9rant'', opening fire on the new opponent and using the unengaged starboard guns to exchange occasional shots with the frigate ''[[French frigate S\u00e9rieuse (1779)|S\u00e9rieuse]]'' and bomb vessel ''Hercule,'' which were anchored inshore of the battle line.<ref name=\"WLC361\"/>\n\nFoley's attack was followed by Hood in ''Zealous'', who also crossed the French line and successfully anchored next to ''Guerrier'' in the space Foley had intended, engaging the lead ship's bow from close range.<ref name=\"RLA25\">[[#Reference-Adkins|Adkins, p. 25]]</ref> Within five minutes ''Guerrier''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s foremast had fallen, to cheers from the crews of the approaching British ships.<ref name=\"WLC362\">[[#Reference-Clowes|Clowes, p. 362]]</ref> The speed of the British advance took the French captains by surprise; they were still aboard ''Orient'' in conference with the admiral when the firing started. Hastily launching their boats, they returned to their vessels. Captain [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois-Timoth\u00e9e Trullet]] of ''Guerrier'' shouted orders from his barge for his men to return fire on ''Zealous''.<ref name=\"RLA25\" />\n\nThe third British ship into action was [[HMS Orion (1787)|HMS ''Orion'']] under Captain [[James Saumarez, 1st Baron de Saumarez|Sir James Saumarez]], which rounded the engagement at the head of the battle line and passed between the French main line and the frigates that lay closer inshore.<ref name=\"PP124\">[[#Reference-Padfield|Padfield, p. 124]]</ref> As he did so, the frigate ''S\u00e9rieuse'' opened fire on ''Orion'', wounding two men. The [[convention in naval warfare]] of the time was that ships of the line did not attack frigates when there were ships of equal size to engage, but in firing first French Captain [[Claude-Jean Martin]] had negated the rule. Saumarez waited until the frigate was at close range before replying.<ref name=\"RLA26\">[[#Reference-Adkins|Adkins, p. 26]]</ref> ''Orion'' needed just one broadside to reduce the frigate to a wreck, and Martin's disabled ship drifted away over the shoal.<ref name=\"WJ165\" /> During the delay this detour caused, two other British ships joined the battle: [[HMS Theseus (1786)|Theseus]], which had been disguised as a [[first-rate]] ship,<ref name=\"OW109\">[[#Reference-Warner|Warner, p. 109]]</ref> followed Foley's track across ''Guerrier''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s bow. Miller steered his ship through the middle of the melee between the anchored British and French ships until he encountered the third French ship, ''[[HMS Spartiate (1798)|Spartiate]]''. Anchoring to port, Miller's ship opened fire at close range. [[HMS Audacious (1785)|HMS ''Audacious'']] under Captain [[Davidge Gould]] crossed the French line between ''Guerrier'' and ''Conqu\u00e9rant'', anchoring between the ships and raking them both.<ref name=\"WLC362\" />{{Cref2|Note B}} ''Orion'' then rejoined the action further south than intended, firing on the fifth French ship, ''[[French ship Souverain (1792)|Peuple Souverain]],'' and Admiral Blanquet's flagship, ''[[French ship Franklin (1797)|Franklin]]''.<ref name=\"WJ165\">[[#Reference-James|James, p. 165]]</ref>\n[[File:Battle of the Nile.jpg|thumb|left|Battle of the Nile - Rif'at]]\nThe next three British ships, ''Vanguard'' in the lead followed by [[HMS Minotaur (1793)|HMS ''Minotaur'']] and [[HMS Defence (1763)|HMS ''Defence'']], remained in line of battle formation and anchored on the starboard side of the French line at 18:40.<ref name=\"RG33\" /> Nelson focused his flagship's fire on ''Spartiate'', while Captain [[Thomas Louis]] in ''Minotaur'' attacked the unengaged ''[[French ship Aquilon (1789)|Aquilon]]'' and Captain [[John Peyton (Royal Navy officer)|John Peyton]] in ''Defence'' joined the attack on ''Peuple Souverain''.<ref name=\"WLC362\" /> With the French vanguard now heavily outnumbered, the following British ships, [[HMS Bellerophon (1786)|HMS ''Bellerophon'']] and [[HMS Majestic (1785)|HMS ''Majestic'']]'','' passed by the melee and advanced on the so far unengaged French centre.<ref name=\"PP127\">[[#Reference-Padfield|Padfield, p. 127]]</ref> Both ships were soon fighting enemies much more powerful than they and began to take severe damage.

By this time, ''Guerrier'' had been completely dismasted and heavily battered. ''Zealous'' by contrast was barely touched: Hood had situated ''Zealous'' outside the arc of most of the French ship's broadsides, and in any case ''Guerrier'' was not prepared for an engagement on both sides simultaneously, with its port guns blocked by stores.<ref name=\"WJ166\"/> Although their ship was a wreck, the crew of ''Guerrier'' refused to surrender, continuing to fire the few functional guns whenever possible despite heavy answering fire from ''Zealous''.<ref name=\"NM267\">[[#Reference-Mostert|Mostert, p. 267]]</ref> In addition to his cannon fire, Hood called up his marines and ordered them to fire volleys of musket shot at the deck of the French ship, driving the crew out of sight but still failing to secure the surrender from Captain Trullet. It was not until 21:00, when Hood sent a small boat to ''Guerrier'' with a boarding party, that the French ship finally surrendered.<ref name=\"WJ166\"/> ''Conqu\u00e9rant'' was defeated more rapidly, after heavy broadsides from passing British ships and the close attentions of ''Audacious'' and ''Goliath'' brought down all three masts before 19:00. With his ship immobile and badly damaged, the mortally wounded Captain [[Etienne Dalbarade]] [[Striking the colours|struck his colours]] and a boarding party seized control.<ref name=\"WLC364\"/> Unlike ''Zealous'', these British ships suffered relatively severe damage in the engagement. ''Goliath'' lost most of its rigging, suffered damage to all three masts and suffered more than 60 casualties.<ref name=\"WJ167\">[[#Reference-James|James, p. 167]]</ref> With his opponents defeated, Captain Gould on ''Audacious'' used the spring on his cable to transfer fire to ''Spartiate'', the next French ship in line.

Within minutes all three of his ship's masts had fallen, but the battle around ''Spartiate'' continued until 21:00, when the badly wounded Emeriau ordered his colours struck.<ref name=\"WJ167\"/> Although ''Spartiate'' was outnumbered, it had been supported by the next in line, ''Aquilon'', which was the only ship of the French van squadron fighting a single opponent, ''Minotaur''. Captain [[Antoine Ren\u00e9 Th\u00e9venard]] used the spring on his anchor cable to angle his broadside into a raking position across the bow of Nelson's flagship, which consequently suffered more than 100 casualties, including the admiral.<ref name=\"WJ167\"/> At approximately 20:30, an iron splinter fired in a [[Naval artillery in the Age of Sail#Shot|langrage]] shot from ''Spartiate ''struck Nelson over his blinded right eye.<ref name=\"OW92\">[[#Reference-Warner|Warner, p. 92]]</ref> The wound caused a flap of skin to fall across his face, rendering him temporarily completely blind.<ref name=\"WJ175\">[[#Reference-James|James, p. 175]]</ref> Nelson collapsed into the arms of Captain [[Edward Berry]] and was carried below.

''Peuple Souverain'' drifted south towards the flagship ''Orient'', which mistakenly opened fire on the darkened vessel.<ref name=\"IG59\">[[#Reference-Germani|Germani, p. 59]]</ref> ''Orion'' and ''Defence'' were unable to immediately pursue. ''Defence'' had lost its fore topmast and an improvised [[fireship]] that drifted through the battle narrowly missed ''Orion''.

The wrecked ship surrendered during the night. ''Franklin'' remained in combat, but Blanquet had suffered a severe head wound and Captain Gillet had been carried below unconscious with severe wounds.

Burning [[wadding]] from one of the British ships is believed to have floated onto the poop deck and ignited the paint.

Many ships had only [[jury masts]] and it took a full day for the convoy to reach the mouth of the bay, finally sailing into open water on 15 August. On 16 August the British burned and destroyed the grounded prize ''Heureux'' as no longer fit for service and on 18 August also burned ''Guerrier'' and ''Mercure''.<ref name=\"WJ183\" /> On 19 August, Nelson sailed for Naples with ''Vanguard'', ''Culloden,'' and ''Alexander'', leaving Hood in command of ''Zealous'', ''Goliath'', ''Swiftsure,'' and the recently joined frigates to watch over French activities at Alexandria.<ref name=\"WJ184\">[[#Reference-James|James, p. 184]]</ref>\n\nThe first message to reach Bonaparte regarding the disaster that had overtaken his fleet arrived on 14 August at his camp on the road between [[Salahieh]] and [[Cairo]].<ref name=\"JC110\" /> The messenger was a staff officer sent by the Governor of Alexandria General [[Jean Baptiste Kl\u00e9ber]], and the report had been hastily written by Admiral Ganteaume, who had subsequently rejoined Villeneuve's ships at sea. One account reports that when he was handed the message, Bonaparte read it without emotion before calling the messenger to him and demanding further details. When the messenger had finished, the French general reportedly announced ''\"Nous n'avons plus de flotte: eh bien. Il faut rester en ces contr\u00e9es, ou en sortir grands comme les anciens\"'' (\"We no longer have a fleet: well, we must either remain in this country or quit it as great as the ancients\").<ref name=\"WJ184\" /> Another story, as told by the general's secretary, [[Louis Antoine Fauvelet de Bourrienne|Bourienne]], claims that Bonaparte was almost overcome by the news and exclaimed \"Unfortunate Brueys, what have you done!\"<ref name=\"RLA38\" /> Bonaparte later placed much of the blame for the defeat on the wounded Admiral Blanquet, falsely accusing him of surrendering ''Franklin'' while his ship was undamaged. Protestations from Ganteaume and Minister \u00c9tienne Eustache Bruix later reduced the degree of criticism Blanquet faced, but he never again served in a command capacity.<ref name=\"WJ184\" /> Bonaparte's most immediate concern however was with his own officers, who began to question the wisdom of the entire expedition.

According to Acts 4:36, Barnabas was a [[Cyprus|Cypriot]] [[Jew]]. Named an [[Apostle (Christian)|apostle]] in Acts 14:14, he and [[Paul the Apostle]] undertook missionary journeys together and defended [[Gentile]] converts against the [[Judaizers]]. They traveled together making more converts (c. 45\u201347), and participated in the [[Council of Jerusalem]] (c. 50) Barnabas and Paul successfully evangelized among the [[Godfearers|\"God-fearing\"]] Gentiles who attended [[synagogue]]s in various [[Hellenization|Hellenized]] cities of [[Anatolia]].\n\nBarnabas' story appears in the [[Acts of the Apostles]], and Paul mentions him in some of his [[epistle]]s. [[Tertullian]] named him as the author of the [[Epistle to the Hebrews]], but this and other attributions are conjecture. [[Clement of Alexandria]] and some scholars have ascribed the [[Epistle of Barnabas]] to him, but his authorship is disputed.\n\nAlthough the date, place, and circumstances of his death are historically unverifiable, Christian tradition holds that Barnabas was [[martyr]]ed at [[Salamis, Cyprus]], in 61 AD. He is traditionally identified as the founder of the [[Cypriot Orthodox Church]]. The [[feast day]] of Barnabas is celebrated on June 11.\n\nBarnabas is usually identified as the cousin of [[Mark the Evangelist]] on the basis of Colossians 4.  Infrequent occurrence in the Septuagint to its presence in Josephus and Philo, \"anepsios\" consistently carries the connotation of \"cousin\". Some traditions hold that [[Aristobulus of Britannia]], one of the [[Seventy Disciples]], was the brother of Barnabas.\n\n== Name and etymologies ==\nHis [[Greeks|Hellenic]] [[Jewish]] parents called him Joseph (although the [[Byzantine text-type]] calls him {{lang|grc|\u0399\u1f60\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2}}, ''I\u014ds\u0113s'', 'Joses', a [[Greek language|Greek]] variant of 'Joseph'), but when he sold all his goods and gave the money to the apostles in [[Jerusalem]], they gave him a new name: Barnabas. This name appears to be from the [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] {{lang|arc|\u05d1\u05e8 \u05e0\u05d7\u05de\u05d4}}, ''{{transl|sem|bar ne\u1e25m\u0101}}'', meaning 'son (of) consolation'. The Greek text of the {{Bibleref2|Acts|4:36}} explains the name as {{lang|grc|\u03c5\u1f31\u1f78\u03c2 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03bb\u03ae\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03c2}}, ''hyios parakl\u0113se\u014ds'', meaning ''\"son of consolation\" or \"son of encouragement\".''\n\n== Biblical narrative ==\n[[File:St-barnab\u00e9-veronese-rouen.jpg|thumb|right|''Barnabas curing the sick'' by [[Paolo Veronese]], [[Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts de Rouen]].]]\nBarnabas appears mainly in [[Acts]], a history of the early [[Christian church]]. He also appears in several of [[Paul's epistles]].\n\nBarnabas, a native of [[Cyprus]] and a [[Levite]], is first mentioned in the [[Acts of the Apostles]] as a member of the early Christian community in [[Jerusalem]], who sold some land that he owned and gave the proceeds to the community (Acts 4:36-37). When the future [[Paul of Tarsus|Apostle Paul]] returned to Jerusalem after his conversion, Barnabas introduced him to the apostles (9:27). Easton, in his Bible Dictionary, supposes that they had been fellow students in the school of [[Gamaliel]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eastonsbibledictionary.org/453-Barnabas.php|title=Barnabas|website=eastonsbibledictionary.org}}</ref>\n\nThe successful preaching of Christianity at Antioch to non-Jews led the church at Jerusalem to send Barnabas there to oversee the movement (Acts 11:20\u201322). He found the work so extensive and weighty that he went to [[Tarsus (city)|Tarsus]] in search of Paul (still referred to as Saul), \"an admirable colleague\", to assist him. Paul returned with him to Antioch and labored with him for a whole year (Acts 11:25\u201326). At the end of this period, the two were sent up to Jerusalem (44 AD) with contributions from the church at Antioch for the relief of the poorer Christians in Judea.\n\nThey returned to Antioch taking John Mark with them, the cousin or nephew of Barnabas. Later, they went to Cyprus and some of the principal cities of [[Pamphylia]], [[Pisidia]], and [[Lycaonia]] (Acts 13:14). After recounting what the governor of Cyprus [[Sergius Paulus]] believed,  Acts 13:9 speaks of Barnabas's companion no longer as Saul, but as Paul, his [[Roman naming conventions|Roman name]], and generally refers to the two no longer as \"Barnabas and Saul\" as heretofore (11:30; 12:25; 13:2, 7), but as \"Paul and Barnabas\" (13:43, 46, 50; 14:20; 15:2, 22, 35). Only in 14:14 and 15:12-25 does Barnabas again occupy the first place, in the first passage with recollection of 14:12, in the last 2, because Barnabas stood in closer relation to the Jerusalem church than Paul. Paul appears as the more eloquent missionary (13:16; 14:8-9; 19-20), whence the [[Lystran]]s regarded him as [[Hermes]] and Barnabas as [[Zeus]].The [[King James Version]] renders the [[Greek language|Greek]] name \"Zeus\" by the [[Latin]] name \"[[Jupiter (god)|Jupiter]]\" (14:12).\n\n[[File:Breenbergh, Bartholomeus, Saints Paul and Barnabas at Lystra (Sacrifice at Lystra), 1637.jpg|thumb|left|''Saints Paul and Barnabas at Lystra (Sacrifice at Lystra)'' by [[Bartholomeus Breenberg]], 1637, [[Princeton University Art Museum]]]]\n\nReturning from this first missionary journey to Antioch, they were again sent up to Jerusalem to consult with the church there regarding the relation of Gentiles to the church (Acts 15:2; Galatians 2:1). According to Galatians 2:9-10, Barnabas was included with Paul in the agreement made between them, on the one hand, and [[James, brother of Jesus|James]], [[Saint Peter|Peter]], and [[John the Apostle|John]], on the other, that the two former should in the future preach to the pagans, not forgetting the poor at Jerusalem. This matter having been settled, they returned again to Antioch, bringing the agreement of the [[Council of Jerusalem|council]] that [[Gentiles]] were to be admitted into the church  without having to adopt Jewish practices.\n\nAfter they had returned to Antioch from the Jerusalem council, they spent some time there (15:35). Peter came and associated freely there with the Gentiles, eating with them, until criticized for this by some disciples of James, as against Mosaic law. Upon their remonstrances, Peter yielded apparently through fear of displeasing them, and refused to eat any longer with the Gentiles. Barnabas followed his example. Paul considered that they \"walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel\" and upbraided them before the whole church (Galatians 2:11-15).\n\nPaul then asked Barnabas to accompany him on another journey (15:36). Barnabas wished to take John Mark along, but Paul did not, as he had left them on the earlier journey (15:37-38). The dispute ended by Paul and Barnabas taking separate routes. Paul took [[Silas]] as his companion, and journeyed through [[Syria]] and [[Cilicia]]; while Barnabas took John Mark to visit Cyprus (15:36-41). [[John Francis Fenlon]] suggests that Paul may have been somewhat influenced by the attitude recently taken by Barnabas, which might have proven prejudicial to their work.\n\nBarnabas is not mentioned again in the [[Acts of the Apostles]]. However, Gal. 2:11-13 says, \"And when [[Kephas]] came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face because he clearly was wrong. For, until some people came from James, he used to eat with the Gentiles; but when they came, he began to draw back and separated himself, because he was afraid of the circumcised. And the rest of the Jews (also) acted hypocritically along with him, with the result that even Barnabas was carried away by their hypocrisy.\" Barnabas is also mentioned in the [[First Epistle to the Corinthians]], in which it is mentioned that he and Paul funded their missions by working side jobs and (it is implied) went without wives and other benefits other apostles received (1 Cor. 9:6); Paul states that he and Barnabas forsook those benefits \"that we may cause no hindrance to the Good News of Christ\" (1 Cor. 9:12).\n\n== Barnabas and Antioch ==\n[[Antioch]], the third-most important city of the Roman Empire,<ref>Cross, F.

New York: Oxford University Press. 2005</ref> It relates that certain Jews coming to Syria and Salamis, where Barnabas was then preaching the gospel, being highly exasperated at his extraordinary success, fell upon him as he was disputing in the synagogue, dragged him out, and, after the most inhumane [[torture]]s, stoned him to death. His kinsman, John Mark, who was a spectator of this barbarous action, privately interred his body.<ref name=PFS>\"The Life of our Blessed Lord and Savior Jesus Christ: And the Lives and Sufferings of His Holy Evangelists and Apostles,\" p.455, 1857 AD, Miller, Orton & Co., 25 Park Row, New York.</ref>\n\nAlthough it is believed he was [[martyr]]ed by being stoned, the [[apocrypha]]l [[Acts of Barnabas]] states that he was bound with a rope by the neck, and then being dragged only to the site where he would be burned to death. This is highly unlikely since the apocryphal Acts states that his bones were burnt to dust and that relics of some of his bones are stored in a church today; on the other hand, the fire in the apocryphal Acts could have cremated only some of his bones.\n\nAccording to the History of the Cyprus Church,<ref>Church of Cyprus, History of Cyprus Church, The Autocephaly of the Cyprus Church [http://www.churchofcyprus.org.cy/article.php?articleID=92 churchofcyprus.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723150830/http://www.churchofcyprus.org.cy/article.php?articleID=92 |date=2011-07-23 }}</ref> in 478 Barnabas appeared in a dream to the Archbishop of Constantia ([[Salamis, Cyprus]]) Anthemios and revealed to him the place of his sepulchre beneath a [[carob]]-tree. The following day Anthemios found the tomb and inside it the remains of Barnabas with a manuscript of Matthew's Gospel on his breast. Anthemios presented the Gospel to Emperor [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]] at [[Constantinople]] and received from him the privileges of the [[Cypriot Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox Church of Cyprus]], that is, the purple cloak which the [[List of archbishops of Cyprus|Greek Archbishop of Cyprus]] wears at festivals of the church, the imperial sceptre and the red ink with which he affixes his signature.\n\nAnthemios then placed the venerable remains of Barnabas in a church which he founded near the tomb. Excavations near the site of a present-day church and monastery, have revealed an early church with two empty tombs, believed to be that of St. Barnabas and Anthemios.<ref>Cyprus Commemorative Stamp issue: 1900th Death Anniversary of Apostle Barnabas, [http://www.philatelism.com/details.php?issueid=22 philatelism.com]</ref>\n\nSt. Barnabas is venerated as the [[Patron Saint]] of [[Cyprus]].\n\n==Other sources==\nAlthough many assume that the biblical [[Mark the Cousin of Barnabas]] ([[Colossians]] 4:10) is the same as John Mark (Acts 12:12, 25; 13:5, 13; 15: 37) and [[Mark the Evangelist]], the traditionally believed author of the [[Gospel of Mark]], according to [[Hippolytus of Rome]],<ref>Ante-Nicean Fathers, ed. Alexander Roberts, James Donaldson and A. Cleaveland Coxe, vol. 5 (Peabody MA: Hendrickson Publishers, 1999), 255-6</ref> the three \"Mark\"s are distinct persons. They were all members of the [[Seventy Disciples|Seventy Apostles of Christ]], including Barnabas himself. There are two people named Barnabas among Hippolytus' list of Seventy Disciples, one (#13) became the bishop of Milan, the other (#25) the bishop of Heraclea. Most likely one of these two is the biblical Barnabas; the first one is more likely, because the numbering by Hippolytus seems to indicate a level of significance. [[Clement of Alexandria]] (''Stromata'', ii, 20) also makes Barnabas one of the [[Seventy Disciples]] that are mentioned in the [[Gospel of Luke]] 10:1ff.\n\nOther sources bring Barnabas to [[Rome]] and [[Alexandria, Egypt|Alexandria]]. In the [[Clementine literature|\"Clementine Recognitions\"]] (i, 7) he is depicted as preaching in Rome even during Christ's lifetime.\n\nNot older than the 3rd century is the tradition of the later activity and martyrdom of Barnabas in [[Cyprus]], where his remains are said to have been discovered under the Emperor [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]]. The question whether Barnabas was an apostle was often discussed during the Middle Ages.<ref>Compare [[C. J. Hefele]], ''Das Sendschreiben des Apostels Barnabas,'' T\u00fcbingen, 1840; [[Otto Braunsberger]], \"Der Apostel Barnabas,\" Mainz, 1876.</ref>\n\n== Alleged writings ==\n[[Tertullian]] and other Western writers regard Barnabas as the author of the [[Letter to the Hebrews]]. This may have been the Roman tradition\u2014which Tertullian usually follows\u2014and in Rome the epistle may have had its first readers. Modern biblical scholarship considers its authorship unknown, though Barnabas amongst others has been proposed as potential authors.<ref>Mitchell, Alan C. ''Hebrews'' (Liturgical Press, 2007) p. 6.</ref>\n\n\u201c[[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]] of the ninth century, refers to some in his day who were uncertain whether the Acts was written by Clement of Rome, Barnabas, or Luke. Yet Photius is certain that the work must be ascribed to Luke.\u201d <ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=IcwSvPYSpvkC&pg=PA7 ''Commentary on the Acts''] Edwin Wilbur Rice, 1900, p.7. Adolf Harnack mistakenly wrote that Photius believed Barnabas was the author in the 1908 Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge, Volume 1, p. 487</ref>\n\nHe is also traditionally associated with the [[Epistle of Barnabas]], although some modern scholars think it more likely that that epistle was written in Alexandria in the 130s. John Dominic Crossan quotes Koester as stating that New Testament writings are used \"neither explicitly nor tacitly\" in the Epistle of Barnabas and that this \"would argue for an early date, perhaps even before the end of the first century AD.\" Crossan continues (The Cross that Spoke, p.&nbsp;121):\nRichardson and Shukster have also argued for a first-century date. Among several arguments they point to the detail of \"a little king, who shall subdue three of the kings under one\" and \"a little crescent horn, and that it subdued under one three of the great horns\" in Barnabas 4:4-5. They propose a composition \"date during or immediately after the reign of Nerva (96-8 AD.) . . . viewed as bringing to an end the glorious Flavian dynasty of Vespasian, Titus, and Domitian . . . when a powerful, distinguished, and successful dynasty was brought low, humiliated by an assassin's knife\" (33, 40).\nIn 16:3-4, the Epistle of Barnabas says: \"Furthermore he says again, 'Lo, they who destroyed this temple shall themselves build it.' That is happening now. For owing to the war it was destroyed by the enemy; at present even the servants of the enemy will build it up again.\" This clearly places Barnabas after the destruction of the temple in 70 AD. But it also places Barnabas before the Bar Kochba revolt in 132 AD, after which there could have been no hope that the Romans would help to rebuild the temple. This shows that the document comes from the period between these two revolts.\nJay Curry Treat states on the dating of Barnabas (The Anchor Bible Dictionary, v. 1, pp.&nbsp;613\u2013614):\nSince Barnabas 16:3 refers to the destruction of the temple, Barnabas must be written after 70 C.E. It must be written before its first indisputable use in Clement of Alexandria, ca. 190. Since 16:4 expects the temple to be rebuilt, it was most likely written before Hadrian built a Roman temple on the site ca. 135. Attempts to use 4:4-5 and 16:1-5 to specify the time of origin more exactly have not won wide agreement. It is important to remember that traditions of varying ages have been incorporated into this work.\nTreat comments on the provenance of the Epistle of Barnabas (op. cit., p.&nbsp;613):\nBarnabas does not give enough indications to permit confident identification of either the teacher's location or the location to which he writes. His thought, hermeneutical methods, and style have many parallels throughout the known Jewish and Christian worlds. Most scholars have located the work's origin in the area of Alexandria, on the grounds that it has many affinities with Alexandrian Jewish and Christian thought and because its first witnesses are Alexandrian. Recently, Prigent (Prigent and Kraft 1971: 20-24), Wengst (1971: 114-18), and Scorza Barcellona (1975: 62-65) have suggested other origins based on affinities in Palestine, Syria, and Asia Minor. The place of origin must remain an open question, although the Gk-speaking E. Mediterranean appears most probable.\nConcerning the relationship between Barnabas and the New Testament, Treat writes (op. cit., p.&nbsp;614):\nAlthough Barnabas 4:14 appears to quote Matt 22:14, it must remain an open question whether the Barnabas circle knew written gospels. Based on Koester's analysis (1957: 125-27, 157), it appears more likely that Barnabas stood in the living oral tradition used by the written gospels. For example, the reference to gall and vinegar in Barnabas 7:3, 5 seems to preserve an early stage of tradition that influenced the formation of the passion narratives in the Gospel of Peter and the synoptic gospels.\n\nThe 5th century ''[[Decretum Gelasianum]]'' includes a ''Gospel of Barnabas'' amongst works condemned as [[apocrypha]]l; but no certain text or quotation from this work has been identified.\n\nAnother book using that same title, the [[Gospel of Barnabas]], survives in two post-medieval manuscripts in Italian and Spanish.<ref>Compare [[T.

Engraving by Willem Swidde.]]\n\nBirka was founded around AD 750 by either a king in order to control and expand trade or it emerged from a seasonal trading place around.<ref name=\":0\" /> It is one of the earliest urban settlements in Scandinavia. Birka was the Baltic link in [[Dnieper trade route|the river and portage route]] through [[Staraya Ladoga|Ladoga]] (Aldeigja) and [[Novgorod]] (Holmsgard) to the [[Byzantine Empire]] and the [[Abbasid]] [[Califate]].<ref>2006 [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]. Article \"Birca\".</ref> Birka was also important as the site of the first known [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Wiktionary:congregation|congregation]] in Sweden, founded in 831 by [[Ansgar|Saint Ansgar]].\n\nAs a trading center Birka most likely offered [[Fur|furs]] and iron goods as well as craft products, in exchange for various materials from much of Europe and western Asia. Furs were obtained from the [[Sami people|Sami]], [[Finns]], and people in northwestern Russia as well as from local trappers. Furs included [[bear]], [[fox]], [[marten]], [[otter]], [[beaver]] and other species. Reindeer antler was an important item in exchange as well as hand-carved [[Comb|combs]] made from antler. Also walrus teeth, amber, and honey were exchanged. Foreign goods found from the graves of Birka include glass and metal ware, pottery from the [[Rhineland]], clothing and textiles including [[Chinese silk]], Byzantine [[embroidery]] with extremely fine gold thread, [[Brocade|brocades]] with gold [[passementerie]] and plaited cords of high quality. From the ninth century onwards coins minted at [[Haithabu]] in northern Germany and elsewhere in Scandinavia start to appear. The vast majority of the coins found at Birka are however silver [[Dirham|dirhams]] from the Caliphate. English and Carolingian coins are rare.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nSources of Birka are mainly archaeological remains. No texts survive from this area, though the written text ''[[Vita Ansgari]]'' (\"The life of Ansgar\") by [[Rimbert]] (c. 865) describes the missionary work of [[Ansgar]] around 830 at Birka, and ''Gesta Hammaburgensis Ecclesiae Pontificum'' (Deeds of Bishops of the Hamburg Church) by [[Adam of Bremen]] in 1075 describes the [[archbishop]] Unni, who died at Birka in 936.<!--The majority of sources I was able to consult, including Britannica, speak about the first settlement of any size from ca. 800. Perhaps this should be reflected in text of the article.--> St Ansgar's work was the first attempt to convert the inhabitants from [[Norse Mythology|the Norse religion]] to Christianity, and it was unsuccessful.\n\nBoth Rimbert and Adam were German clergymen writing in [[Latin]]. There are no known [[Old Norse language|Norse]] sources mentioning the name of the settlement, or even the settlement itself, and the original Norse name of Birka is unknown. ''Birca'' is the [[Romanization|Latinised]] form given in the sources and ''Birka'' its contemporary, unhistorical Swedish form. The Latin name is probably derived from an [[Old Norse]] word \"[[birk (market place)|birk]]\" which probably meant a market place. Related to this was the ''Bj\u00e4rk\u00f6a law'' ([[bj\u00e4rk\u00f6ar\u00e4tt]]) which regulated the life on market places in Denmark, Norway and Sweden. Both terms in different forms are very common in Scandinavian place names still today leading to speculation that all references to Birca especially by Adam of Bremen were not about the same location.\n\nBoth publications are silent on Birca's size, layout and appearance. Based on Rimbert's account, Birca was significant because it had a port and it was the place for the regional [[Thing (assembly)|ting]]. Adam only mentions the port, but otherwise Birca seems to have been significant to him because it had been the bridgehead of Ansgar's Christian mission and because archbishop Unni had been buried there.\n\n''Vita Ansgari'' and ''Gesta'' are sometimes ambiguous, which has caused some controversy as to whether Birca and the Bj\u00f6rk\u00f6 settlement were the same location. Many other locations have been suggested through the years.<ref>Some of them being [[Link\u00f6ping]], [[K\u00f6pingsvik]] and even [[Saltvik]] in [[\u00c5land]].</ref> However, Bj\u00f6rk\u00f6 is the only location that can show remains of a town of Birca's significance, which is why the vast majority of scholars regard Bj\u00f6rk\u00f6 as the location of Birca.<ref>Harrison, Dick, ''Sveriges historia -- medeltiden'' (Falk\u00f6ping, 2002), p. 51</ref>\n\nBirka was abandoned during the later half of the 10th century. Based on the coin finds, the city seems to have silenced around 960.<ref>Lindqvist, Herman. ''Historien om Sverige. Islossning till kungarike''. 1996.

Translation in English.</ref> monk and later [[Archbishopric of Bremen|archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen]] [[Rimbert]] gives the first known description of Birka. The town was the center of Catholic missionary activities in the 9th century Sweden. Rimbert's interests were in the Christian faith, not so much in the Swedish geopolicy, so his descriptions of Birka remain approximate at best.\n\n===Bridgehead of Christian missionaries===\nThis is how it all started in 829:\n\n<blockquote>Meanwhile it happened that Swedish ambassadors had come to the Emperor [[Louis the Pious]], and, amongst other matters which they had been ordered to bring to the attention of the emperor, they informed him that there were many belonging to their nation who desired to embrace the Christian religion, and that their king so far favoured this suggestion that he would permit God's priests to reside there, provided that they might be deemed worthy of such a favour and that the emperor would send them suitable preachers. (Chapter IX)</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>[[Ansgar]] then undertook the mission committed to him by the emperor, who desired that he should go to the Swedes and discover whether this people was prepared to accept the faith as their messengers had declared. (Chapter X)</blockquote>\n\nAnsgar was already experienced in the missionary work in [[Denmark]], and set forth to Sweden. Rimbert describes the trip very generally:\n\n<blockquote>It may suffice for me to say that while they were in the midst of their journey they fell into the hands of pirates. The merchants with whom they were travelling, defended themselves vigorously and for a time successfully, but eventually they were conquered and overcome by the pirates, who took from them their ships and all that they possessed, whilst they themselves barely escaped on. foot to land. \u2014With great difficulty they accomplished their long journey on foot, traversing also the intervening seas (maria), where it was possible, by ship, and eventually arrived at the Swedish port called Birka. (Chapters X and XI)</blockquote>\n\nRimbert does not say where Ansgar sailed off or where he landed. Noteworthy is just his note about several \"seas\" that they had to cross to get to Birka from the place they had landed to. Since Rimbert mentions them to have crossed the seas by ship \"where it was possible\" they clearly had the alternative of going around them as well, meaning that the seas were probably the numerous lakes in southern Sweden. When Ansgar again travelled to Birka from Germany about 852, it went easier:\n\n<blockquote>Ansgar accomplished the journey on which he had set out, and after spending nearly twenty days in a ship, he arrived at Birka (Chapter XXVI)</blockquote>\n\nThis might mean that he sailed off from [[Hamburg]] or [[Bremen (city)|Bremen]] instead of some port in Baltic Sea, since the later account by Adam of Bremen gives the distance of [[Scania]] and Birka to be only five days at sea.\n\n===King in Birka===\nSeveral Swedish kings of the 9th century, [[Bj\u00f6rn at Haugi|Bj\u00f6rn]], [[Anund Uppsale|Anund]] and [[Olof (I) of Sweden|Olof]], are all mentioned in ''Vita'' to have spent time in Birka. None of them is however said to have had his residence there, as the Swedish king and his retinue periodically moved between the [[Husby (estate)|Husby]]s, parts of the network of royal estates called [[Uppsala \u00f6d]].\n\nKing Bj\u00f6rn met Ansgar in Birka when he arrived there in 829 (Chapter XI). Later King Olof met him there as well during his last trip in 852 (Chapter XXVI).\n\n===Church in Birka===\nAnsgar's missionary work resulted in first churches to be built in Sweden. Talking about [[Herigar]], the prefect of Birka:\n\n<blockquote>A little later he built a church on his own ancestral property and served God with the utmost devotion. (Chapter XI)</blockquote>\n\nHerigar's church was not far from the place where tings were held:\n\n<blockquote>On one occasion he himself was sitting in an assembly of people, a stage having been arranged for a council on an open plain. He then summoned his servants and told them to carry him to his church. (Chapter XIX)</blockquote>\n\nAnother church was also built in Sweden, however location is left open:\n\n<blockquote>This Gautbert, who at his consecration received the honoured name of the apostle Simeon, went to Sweden, and was honourably received by the king and the people; and he began, amidst general goodwill and approval, to build a church there (Chapter XIV)</blockquote>\n\nThe exiled Swedish King [[Anund Uppsale]] confirms that either one of the churches was in Birka itself when he ponders if Birka should be plundered:\n\n<blockquote>\"There are there,\" he said, \"many great and powerful gods, and in former time a church was built there, and there are many Christians there who worship Christ\" (Chapter XIX)</blockquote>\n\n===Fortress in Birka?===\n[[File:Entry in a defensive wall on Birka September 2015.jpg|thumb|An entry point in a Viking-era defensive wall on Birka]]\nDanes attacked Birka, accompanied with the deposed king [[Anund Uppsale|Anund]], which caused great distress in the town.\n\n<blockquote>Being in great difficulty they fled to a neighbouring city (ad civitatem, qu\u00e6 iuxta erat, confugerunt) and began to promise and offer to their gods\u2014But inasmuch as the city was not strong and there were few to offer resistance, they sent messengers to the Danes and asked for friendship and alliance. \u2014Hergeir, the faithful servant of the Lord, was angry with them and said, \"They will lead away your wives and sons as captives, they will burn our city (urbs) and town (vicus)\"<ref>The Latin word ''vicus'' which Rimbert uses about Birka can also be translated as \"market place\" or \"village\".</ref> and will destroy you with the sword (Chapter XIX)</blockquote>\n\nAs the neighbouring \"city\" is not mentioned in any other context than during the Danish attack as a place where people took refuge, it probably meant a nearby fortress. Eventually Danes left, sparing Birka from destruction.\n\n===''Ting'' in Birka===\nWhen Ansgar asked if King [[Olof (I) of Sweden|Olof]]<ref>Scandinavian sources omit King Olof from the list of kings that reigned in [[Uppsala]].</ref> would permit him to establish the Christian religion in the kingdom during his second visit in 852, the king said to him:\n\n<blockquote>On this account I have not the power, nor do I dare, to approve the objects of your mission until I can consult our gods by the casting of lots and until I can enquire the will of the people in regard to this matter. Let your messenger attend with me the next assembly (Chapter XXVI)</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>When the day for the assembly which was held in the town of Birka drew near, in accordance with their national custom the king caused a proclamation to be made to the people by the voice of a herald, in order that they might be informed concerning the object of their mission. \u2014The king then rose up from amongst the assembly and forthwith directed one of his own messengers to accompany the bishop's messenger, and to tell him that the people were unanimously inclined to accept his proposal and at the same time to tell him that, whilst their action was entirely agreeable to him, he could not give his full consent until, in another assembly, which was to be held in another part of his kingdom, he could announce this resolution to the people who lived in that district. (Chapter XXVII)</blockquote>\n\n[[Thing (assembly)|Tings]] were huge open-air events, which required plenty of space. The more important ting that king Olof talked about was probably the ''[[Thing of all Swedes|Ting of all Swedes]]'', which was held at the end of February in [[Uppsala]], during the [[Disting]]. The king was obliged to obey the common decisions made at this ting, and the most powerful man at this assembly was not the king, but the [[lawspeaker]] of [[Tiundaland]]. Locally important tings were the Westrogothic ''[[Thing of all Geats|Ting of all Geats]]'' in Skara and the Ostrogothic ''[[Lionga thing|Lionga ting]]'' in the vicinity of today's [[Link\u00f6ping]].\n\n==Adam of Bremen's Birka==\nIn ''[[Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum]]'' (Deeds of Bishops of the Hamburg Church),<ref>[http://hbar.phys.msu.su/gorm/chrons/bremen.htm Adam of Bremen, Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050207105412/http://hbar.phys.msu.su/gorm/chrons/bremen.htm |date=2005-02-07 }}, online text in Latin. Note that ''Scholias'' at the end of the text are later supplements, possibly by Adam himself or copyists. English translation of ''Gesta'' is not available in public domain, and the translation of the selected parts is by Wikipedia editors.</ref> Adam of Bremen mentions Birka many times, and the book is the main source of information on the city. After its initial release in 1075/6, ''Gesta'' was complemented with supplementary ''Scholias'' until the death of Adam in the 1080s. Birca is described as an existing city in the original version, but then as destroyed in ''Scholia 138''.\n\nOne of Adam's main sources had been the German bishop [[Adalvard|Adalvard the Younger]] of [[Sigtuna]] and later of [[Skara]] as hinted in ''Scholia 119''. He was also very familiar with Rimbert's work. Adam himself never visited Birka.\n\n===Birka's location and port===\nAdam described Birka as a [[Geat]]ish port town and had gathered many details about it.\n\n<blockquote>Birka is the main Geatish town ([[oppidum]] Gothorum), situated in the middle of Sweden (Suevoniae), not far (non longe) from the [[Temple at Uppsala|temple called Uppsala]] (Ubsola) which the Swedes (Sueones) held in the highest esteem when it comes to the worship of the gods; here forms an inlet of the Baltic or the Barbaric Sea a port facing north which welcomes all the wild peoples all around this sea but which is risky for those who are careless or ignorant of such places ... they have therefore blocked this inlet of the troubled sea with hidden masses of rocks along more than 100 [[Ancient Greek units of measurement|stadions]] (18 km). On this anchorage, being the best sheltered within the maritime region of Sweden (Suevoniae), all the ships belonging to Danes (Danorum) known as Norwegians (Nortmannorum) as well as to [[Slavs]] (Sclavorum), [[Sambians|Sembrians]] (Semborum) and other [[Scythians|Scythian]] (Scithiae) peoples use to convene every year for sundry necessary commerce. (I 62)</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>Turning from the northern parts to the mouth of the Baltic Sea we first meet the Norwegians (Nortmanni), then the Danish region of [[Sk\u00e5ne]] (Sconia) stands out, and beyond these live the Geats (Gothi) for a long stretch all the way to Birka. (IV 14)</blockquote>\n\nHaving described [[V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland]] and [[Skara]], Adam writes:\n\n<blockquote>Beyond it [[\u00d6sterg\u00f6tland]] (Ostrogothia) extends along the sea, that is called the Baltic Sea, all the way to Birka. (IV 23)</blockquote>\n\nNoteworthy in the following statement is the usage of the term \"not far\" (non longe) which was also used to describe the distance between Birka and the Uppsala temple:\n\n<blockquote>Furthermore we have been told that there are many more islands in that sea, one of which is called the Great [[Estonia|Estland]] (Aestland) -- And this island is told to be quite close to the Woman Land ([[Terra Feminarum|terrae feminarum]]), which<ref>Note that Adam's words \"cum illa superior\" may also refer to [[Courland]] discussed in Chapter IV 16 just before Estland thus meaning that Birka was not far away from Courland. Compare with Rimbert's story about an attack to Courland, ''Vita Ansgari'' Chapter XXX.</ref> is not far (non longe) away from Birka of the Swedes. (IV 17)</blockquote>\n\nAdam also had travel instructions from Sk\u00e5ne to [[Sigtuna]]:\n\n<blockquote>From Sk\u00e5ne (Sconia) of the Danes one reaches Sigtuna (Sictonam) or Birka after five days at sea, for they are indeed alike.<ref>The word ''iuxta'' can also be translated \"close by\".</ref> But by land from Sk\u00e5ne across the Geatish people (Gothorum populos) and cities Skara (Scaranem), Telgas and Birka, one reaches Sigtuna only after a full month. (IV 28)</blockquote>\n\n\"Telgas\" is not mentioned anywhere else, and it remains as speculative as Birka. The most popular identification among many telge names in Sweden is [[S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje]].<ref>Assuming Birka and Bj\u00f6rk\u00f6 settlement were the same, Adam's travel instructions were latest from the 10th century when Bj\u00f6rk\u00f6 settlement still existed. S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje is mentioned as \"T\u00e6lgia\" etc in medieval sources. ''Gesta'' excluded, it is mentioned for the first time in 1281. However, it is considered possible that S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje was already established in the 11th century, but dating the city to be contemporary to the Bj\u00f6rk\u00f6 settlement is unlikely.</ref> ''Scholia 121'' of IV 20 tells also:\n\n<blockquote>For those who sail from Sk\u00e5ne (Sconia) of the Danes to Birka, the journey takes five days, from Birka to Russia (Ruzziam) likewise five days at sea. (Scholia 121)</blockquote>\n\nThe following definition remains even more mysterious:\n\n<blockquote>In pity of their errors, our archbishop ordained as their diocesan capital Birka, which is in the middle of Sweden (Sueoniae) facing [[Jumne]] (Iumnem), the capital of the Slavs, and equally distant from all the coasts of the surrounding sea. (IV 20)</blockquote>\n\nSince it is physically impossible for any Swedish town to face Jumne, the latter being situated along [[Oder|River Oder]], Adam's statement is probably a misunderstanding. No place having a similar name to Birka is known to have situated on the opposite shore of Oder, so it may be possible that something similar to Jumne was located opposite to Birka.\n\n===Bishop in Birka===\n[[Archbishopric of Bremen|Archbishopric of Hamburg-Bremen]] that oversaw the missionary work in Scandinavia until 1103, had appointed bishops to Sweden at least from 1014 onwards, the first see being in [[Skara]]. Several bishops were appointed for Sweden in 1060s, one also for Birka.\n\n<blockquote>For Sweden, six were consecrated: [[Adalvard|Adalvard the Elder]] (Adalwardum) and Acilinum, also [[Adalvard|Adalvard the Younger]] (Adalwardum) and Tadicum, and furthermore Simeon (Symeonem) and the monk John (Iohannem). (III 70)</blockquote>\n\n''Scholia 94'' appends this as follows:\n\n<blockquote>Adalvard the Elder (Adalwardus senior) was to superintend both lands of the Geats (uterque praefectus est Gothiae), Adalvard the Younger Sigtuna (Sictunam) and Uppsala (Ubsalam), Simeon (Symon) the [[Sami people]] (Scritefingos), John (Iohannes) the islands of the Baltic Sea. (Scholia 94)</blockquote>\n\nFurthermore, the following was said about John's location after talking about Birka:\n\n<blockquote>For this city he ordained, as the first among our people, the abbot Hiltin, whom he wanted to call John. (IV 20)</blockquote>\n\nJohn seems to have been situated in Birka in order to prepare for the missionary work among the many heathen people that flooded to Birca from around the Baltic coasts. This was a logical continuation to Birka's position as the first missionary town in Sweden. Noteworthy here is that the biggest islands in the Baltic Sea, [[\u00d6land]] and [[Gotland]], were part of the [[diocese of Link\u00f6ping]] in the Middle Ages, covering also \u00d6sterg\u00f6tland and eastern [[Sm\u00e5land]].\n\n===Location of Unni's tomb===\n''Scholia 122'' of IV 20 locates the tomb of Hamburg's archbishop [[Unni (archbishop)|Unni]] in Birka:\n\n<blockquote>There is the port of Saint [[Ansgar]] and the tomb of the holy Archbishop Unni, and a familiar haven, it is said, for the holy confessors of our diocese. (Scholia 122)</blockquote>\n\nAccording to ''Gesta'', Unni had died in 936 (I 64).<ref>Unni's head was taken to the [[Bremen Cathedral]] where it still today is. Date 17.9.936 is written in the lead plate attached to the saint's skull. Lindqvist, Herman. ''Historien om Sverige'', 1992. {{ISBN|91-1-931502-3}}. See page 226.</ref>\n\n===Birka's destruction===\nAfter having consistently described Birka as an existing city, ''Scholia 138'' of IV 29 describes Birka's sudden demise. Talking about [[Adalvard|Adalvard the Younger]], the bishop of Sigtuna and later that of Skara, Adam or a later copyist has written:\n\n<blockquote>During his journey he seized the opportunity to make a detour to Birka, which is now reduced to loneliness so that one can hardly find vestiges of the city; therefore impossible to come upon the tomb of the holy Archbishop Unni. (Scholia 138)</blockquote>\n\nThe remark does not make it clear if Adalvard found the city destroyed or if that had happened after his visit and the later remark was just to warn the future pilgrims not to go there anymore in vain. As Adalvard was back in Bremen already by 1069 and is mentioned as one of Adam's sources of information, it would have been expected that word about Birka's destruction had reached also Adam before he published his work half a decade later.\n\n==Bj\u00f6rk\u00f6 archaeological site==\n[[File:Birka Svarta jorden 1991.jpg|thumb|1991 excavation in dark earth]]\n[[File:BirkaExcavation2.png|thumb|right|July 2004 excavation of Birka]]\nThe exact location of Birca was also lost during the centuries, leading to speculation from Swedish historians. However, the island of Bj\u00f6rk\u00f6 was first claimed to have been Birka already about 1450 in the so-called \"[[Chronicle of Sweden]]\" (''Prosaiska kr\u00f6nikan''):\n\n<blockquote>And there were three capitals in Sweden two of which were not long away from Uppsala (vpsala). The one was called Sigtuna (siktuna) and the other Birka (birka). Birka was on an island in Lake M\u00e4laren (m\u00e4lar) that is called Bj\u00f6rk\u00f6 (birk\u00f6\u00f6). The third was in Westg\u00f6taland (westerg\u00f6tlandh) and was called Skara (skara).<ref>[http://www.nordlund.lu.se/Fornsvenska/Fsv%20Folder/05_Filer/Proskron.rtf Prosaiska kr\u00f6nikan]. Original text. Translation in English is by Wikipedia editors.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn search of Birka, National Antiquarian [[Johan Hadorph]] was the first to attempt excavations on Bj\u00f6rk\u00f6 in the late 17th century.\n\nIn the late 19th century, [[Hjalmar Stolpe]], an [[Entomology|entomologist]] by education, arrived on Bj\u00f6rk\u00f6 to study fossilized insects found in [[amber]] on the island. Stolpe found very large amounts of amber on the island, which is unusual since amber is not normally found in lake M\u00e4laren. Stolpe speculated that the island may have been an important trading post, prompting him to conduct a series of archeological excavations between 1871-95. The excavations soon indicated that a major settlement had been located on the island and eventually Stolpe spent two decades excavating the island. After Bj\u00f6rk\u00f6 came to be identified with ancient Birka, it has been assumed that the original name of Birka was simply ''Bierk\u00f8'' (sometimes spelt ''Bj\u00e4rk\u00f6''), an earlier form of ''Bj\u00f6rk\u00f6''.\n\nOwnership of Bj\u00f6rk\u00f6 is today mainly in private hands, and used for farming. The settlement site, however is an [[archaeological]] site, and a [[museum]] has been built nearby for exhibition of finds (mostly replicas), models and reconstructions. It is a popular site to visit during the summer times. The complete collection of archaeological finds from the excavations on Bj\u00f6rk\u00f6 are held by [[Swedish Museum of National Antiquities|The Swedish History Museum]] in [[Stockholm]], and many of the artefacts are on display there.\n\nThe archaeological remains are located in the north part of Bj\u00f6rk\u00f6 and span an area of about 7 [[hectare]]s (17 [[acre]]s). The remains are both burial-sites and buildings, and in the south part of this area, there is also a [[hill fort]] called \"Borgen\" (\"The Fortress\"). The construction technique of the buildings is still unknown, but the main material was [[wood]]. An adjacent island holds the remains of [[Hovg\u00e5rden]], an estate which housed the King's retinue during visits.\n\nApproximately 700 people lived at Birka when it was at its largest, and about 3,000 graves have been found.<ref>[[Bj\u00f6rn Ambrosiani|Ambrosiani, Bj\u00f6rn]], Birka, in: Pulsiano, Phillip (ed.), Madieval Scandinavia.

Bj\u00f6rk\u00f6 is today mainly agricultural, and shipping lines carry tourists to the island, where a museum showcases a view of life during the Viking era.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Birka}}\n* [http://www.raa.se/upplev-kulturarvet/varldsarv/birka-och-hovgarden/ Birka and Hovg\u00e5rden] at the [[Swedish National Heritage Board]]\n* [http://whc.unesco.org/sites/555.htm Birka and Hovg\u00e5rden] - at UNESCO\n* [https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://uk.geocities.com/ancientinstruments/page0006.html&date=2009-10-25+04:11:38  Reconstructions of Bone Flutes like the ones from Birka]\n* [http://historiska.se/birka// The Swedish History Museum]\n\n{{Baltic emporia}}\n{{World Heritage Sites in Sweden}}\n\n[[Category:Viking Age in Sweden]]\n[[Category:World Heritage Sites in Sweden]]\n[[Category:M\u00e4laren]]\n[[Category:Archaeological sites in Sweden]]\n[[Category:Scandinavian archaeology]]\n[[Category:Former populated places in Sweden]]\n[[Category:Geography of Stockholm County]]\n[[Category:Uppland]]\n[[Category:Museums in Stockholm County]]\n[[Category:Archaeological museums in Sweden]]\n[[Category:Viking Age museums]]", "sha1": "f1lq7owgpn8fxmu2hg74asqp109ld05"}}, {"title": "Beta-lactamase", "ns": "0", "id": "4609", "revision": {"id": "863218962", "parentid": "861776073", "timestamp": "2018-10-09T12:52:44Z", "contributor": {"ip": "117.17.155.57"}, "comment": "/* Evolution */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Infobox protein family\n| Symbol = \u03b2-lactamase domain\n| Name = Beta-lactamase\n| image = PDB_1bsg_EBI.jpg\n| width = 300px\n| caption = Structure of a ''[[Streptomyces albus]]'' beta-lactamase\n| Pfam = PF00144\n| Pfam_clan = CL0013\n| InterPro = IPR001466\n| SMART =\n| PROSITE = PS00146\n| MEROPS =\n| SCOP = 56601\n| TCDB =\n| OPM family =\n| OPM protein =\n| PDB = {{PDB2|1axb}}, {{PDB2|1blp}}, {{PDB2|1bsg}}, {{PDB2|1bue}}, {{PDB2|1e25}}, {{PDB2|1ghi}}, {{PDB2|1i2s}}, {{PDB2|1n9b}}, {{PDB2|1ong}}, {{PDB2|2cc1}}, {{PDB2|2gdn}}, {{PDB2|3dwz}}\n}}\n{{enzyme\n| Name = \u03b2-lactamase\n| EC_number = 3.5.2.6\n| CAS_number = 9073-60-3\n| IUBMB_EC_number = 3/5/2/6\n| GO_code = 0008800\n| image = Lactamase Application V.1.svg\n| width = 300px\n| caption = Action of \u03b2-lactamase and [[decarboxylation]] of the intermediate\n}}\n\n[[Image:Beta-lactam antibiotics example 1.svg|thumb|Core structure of [[penicillin]]s (top) and [[cephalosporin]]s (bottom).

Beta-lactamase provides antibiotic resistance by breaking the [[antibiotic]]s' structure. These antibiotics all have a common element in their molecular structure: a four-atom ring known as a [[\u03b2-lactam]]. Through [[hydrolysis]], the lactamase enzyme breaks the \u03b2-lactam ring open, deactivating the molecule's antibacterial properties.\n\nBeta-lactam antibiotics are typically used to treat a broad spectrum of [[Gram-positive]] and [[Gram-negative]] bacteria.\n\nBeta-lactamases produced by Gram-negative organisms are usually secreted, especially when antibiotics are present in the environment.<ref name=\"pmid4894721\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Neu HC | title = Effect of beta-lactamase location in Escherichia coli on penicillin synergy | journal = Appl Microbiol | volume = 17 | issue = 6 | pages = 783\u20136  | date = June 1969 | pmid = 4894721 | pmc = 377810 | doi =  }}</ref>\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe structure of a ''[[Streptomyces]]'' \u03b2-lactamase is given by {{PDB link|1BSG}}.\n\n== Penicillinase ==\nPenicillinase is a specific type of \u03b2-lactamase, showing specificity for [[penicillin]]s, again by [[hydrolysis|hydrolysing]] the [[\u03b2-lactam]] ring.

Penicillinase-resistant beta-lactams such as [[methicillin]] were developed, but there is now widespread [[antibiotic resistance|resistance]] to even these.\n\n==Resistance in Gram-negative bacteria==\nAmong Gram-negative bacteria, the emergence of resistance to expanded-spectrum cephalossporins has been a major concern. It appeared initially in a limited number of bacterial species (''[[Enterobacter cloacae|E. cloacae]]'', ''[[Citrobacter freundii|C. freundii]]'', ''[[S. marcescens]]'', and ''[[P. aeruginosa]]'') that could mutate to hyperproduce their chromosomal class C \u03b2-lactamase. A few years later, resistance appeared in bacterial species not naturally producing AmpC enzymes (''[[K. pneumoniae]]'', ''[[Salmonella]]'' spp., ''[[Proteus mirabilis|P. mirabilis]]'') due to the production of TEM- or SHV-type ESBLs (extended spectrum beta lactamases). Characteristically, such resistance has included oxyimino- (for example [[ceftizoxime]], [[cefotaxime]], [[ceftriaxone]], and [[ceftazidime]], as well as the oxyimino-monobactam [[aztreonam]]), but not 7-alpha-methoxy-cephalosporins  ([[cephamycins]]; in other words, [[cefoxitin]] and [[cefotetan]]); has been blocked by inhibitors such as [[clavulanate]], [[sulbactam]] or [[tazobactam]] and did not involve [[carbapenems]] and [[temocillin]]. Chromosomal-mediated AmpC \u03b2-lactamases represent a new threat, since they confer resistance to 7-alpha-methoxy-cephalosporins ([[cephamycins]]) such as [[cefoxitin]] or [[cefotetan]] but are not affected by commercially available \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors, and can, in strains with loss of outer membrane porins, provide resistance to carbapenems.<ref name=\"pmid11751104\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Philippon A, Arlet G, Jacoby GA | title = Plasmid-determined AmpC-type beta-lactamases | journal = Antimicrob.

These beta-lactamases differ from the TEM and SHV enzymes in that they belong to molecular class D and functional group 2d . The OXA-type beta-lactamases confer resistance to [[ampicillin]] and [[cephalothin]] and are characterized by their high hydrolytic activity against [[oxacillin]] and [[cloxacillin]] and the fact that they are poorly inhibited by [[clavulanic acid]]. Amino acid substitutions in OXA enzymes can also give the ESBL phenotype. While most ESBLs have been found in ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'', ''[[K. pneumoniae]]'', and other [[Enterobacteriaceae]], the OXA-type ESBLs have been found mainly in ''[[P. aeruginosa]]''. OXA-type ESBLs have been found mainly in ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' isolates from Turkey and France. The OXA beta-lactamase family was originally created as a phenotypic rather than a genotypic group for a few beta-lactamases that had a specific hydrolysis profile. Therefore, there is as little as 20% sequence homology among some of the members of this family. However, recent additions to this family show some degree of homology to one or more of the existing members of the OXA beta-lactamase family. Some confer resistance predominantly to ceftazidime, but OXA-17 confers greater resistance to cefotaxime and cefepime than it does resistance to ceftazidime.\n\n==== Others ====\nOther plasmid-mediated ESBLs, such as PER, VEB, GES, and IBC beta-lactamases, have been described but are uncommon and have been found mainly in ''[[P. aeruginosa]]'' and at a limited number of geographic sites. PER-1 in isolates in Turkey, France, and Italy; VEB-1 and VEB-2 in strains from Southeast Asia; and GES-1, GES-2, and IBC-2 in isolates from South Africa, France, and Greece. PER-1 is also common in multiresistant acinetobacter species in Korea and Turkey. Some of these enzymes are found in Enterobacteriaceae as well, whereas other uncommon ESBLs (such as BES-1, IBC-1, SFO-1, and TLA-1) have been found only in Enterobacteriaceae.\n\n====Treatment====\nWhile ESBL-producing organisms were previously associated with hospitals and institutional care, these organisms are now increasingly found in the community.  CTX-M-15-positive [[Escherichia coli|E. coli]] are a cause of community-acquired [[cystitis|urinary infections]] in the UK,<ref name = \"Woodford_2006\"/> and tend to be resistant to all oral \u03b2-lactam antibiotics, as well as [[quinolone antibiotic|quinolones]] and [[sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfonamide]]s.  Treatment options may include [[nitrofurantoin]], [[fosfomycin]], [[mecillinam]] and [[chloramphenicol]].  In desperation, once-daily [[ertapenem]] or [[gentamicin]] injections may also be used.\n\n=== Inhibitor-resistant \u03b2-lactamases ===\nAlthough the inhibitor-resistant \u03b2-lactamases are not ESBLs, they are often discussed with ESBLs because they are also derivatives of the classical TEM- or SHV-type enzymes. These enzymes were at first given the designation IRT for inhibitor-resistant TEM \u03b2-lactamase; however, all have subsequently been renamed with numerical TEM designations. There are at least 19 distinct inhibitor-resistant TEM \u03b2-lactamases. Inhibitor-resistant TEM \u03b2-lactamases have been found mainly in clinical isolates of ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'', but also some strains of ''[[K. pneumoniae]]'', ''[[Klebsiella oxytoca]]'', ''[[Proteus mirabilis|P. mirabilis]]'', and ''[[Citrobacter freundii]]''. Although the inhibitor-resistant TEM variants are resistant to inhibition by [[clavulanic acid]] and [[sulbactam]], thereby showing clinical resistance to the beta-lactam\u2014lactamase inhibitor combinations of [[amoxicillin]]-[[clavulanate]] ([[co-amoxiclav]]), [[ticarcillin]]-[[clavulanate]] ([[co-ticarclav]]), and [[ampicillin/sulbactam]], they normally remain susceptible to inhibition by [[tazobactam]] and subsequently the combination of [[piperacillin/tazobactam]],{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the tazobactam susceptibility, as source n\u00b04 states otherwise|date=November 2014}} although resistance has been described. This is no longer a primarily European epidemiology, it is found in northern parts of America often and should be tested for with complex UTI's.<ref name=\"pmid11585791\"/>\n\n===AmpC-type \u03b2-lactamases (Class C)===\nAmpC type \u03b2-lactamases are commonly isolated from extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. AmpC \u03b2-lactamases (also termed class C or group 1) are typically encoded on the chromosome of many Gram-negative bacteria including ''[[Citrobacter]]'', ''[[Serratia]]'' and ''[[Enterobacter]]'' species where its expression is usually [[Regulation of gene expression#Inducible vs. repressible systems|inducible]]; it may also occur on ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' but is not usually inducible, although it can be hyperexpressed.  AmpC type \u03b2-lactamases may also be carried on plasmids.<ref name=\"pmid11751104\"/> AmpC \u03b2-lactamases, in contrast to ESBLs, hydrolyse broad and extended-spectrum cephalosporins (cephamycins as well as to oxyimino-\u03b2-lactams) but are not inhibited by \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors such as [[clavulanic acid]]. AmpC-type \u03b2-lactamase organisms are often clinically grouped through the acronym, \"SPACE\": ''[[Serratia]], [[Pseudomonas]]'' or ''[[Proteus bacteria|Proteus]], [[Acinetobacter]], [[Citrobacter]]'', and ''[[Enterobacter]]''.\n\n===Carbapenemases===\nCarbapenems are famously stable to AmpC \u03b2-lactamases and extended-spectrum-\u03b2-lactamases. Carbapenemases are a diverse group of \u03b2-lactamases that are active not only against the oxyimino-cephalosporins and cephamycins but also against the carbapenems. Aztreonam is stable to the metallo-\u03b2-lactamases,\nbut many IMP and VIM producers are resistant, owing to other mechanisms.   Carbapenemases were formerly believed to derive only from classes A, B, and D, but a class C carbapenemase has been described.\n\n====IMP-type carbapenemases (metallo-\u03b2-lactamases) (Class B)====\nPlasmid-mediated IMP-type carbapenemases, 19 varieties of which are currently known, became established in Japan in the 1990s both in enteric Gram-negative organisms and in ''[[Pseudomonas]]'' and ''[[Acinetobacter]]'' species. IMP enzymes spread slowly to other countries in the Far East, were reported from Europe in 1997, and have been found in Canada and Brazil.\n\n====VIM (Verona integron-encoded metallo-\u03b2-lactamase) (Class B)====\nA second growing family of carbapenemases, the VIM family, was reported from Italy in 1999 and now includes 10 members, which have a wide geographic distribution in Europe, South America, and the Far East and have been found in the United States. VIM-1 was discovered in ''P. aeruginosa'' in Italy in 1996; since then, VIM-2 - now the predominant variant - was found repeatedly in Europe and the Far East; VIM-3 and -4 are minor variants of VIM-2 and -1, respectively. VIM enzymes occur mostly in ''P. aeruginosa'', also ''P. putida'' and, very rarely, Enterobacteriaceae.\n\nAmino acid sequence diversity is up to 10% in the VIM family, 15% in the IMP family, and 70% between VIM and IMP. Enzymes of both the families, nevertheless, are similar. Both are integron-associated, sometimes within plasmids. Both hydrolyse all \u03b2-lactams except monobactams, and evade all \u03b2-lactam inhibitors. The VIM enzymes are among the most widely distributed MBLs, with >40 VIM variants having been reported. Biochemical and biophysical studies revealed that VIM variants have only small variations in their kinetic parameters but substantial differences in their thermal stabilities and inhibition profiles.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Makena|first=Anne|last2=D\u00fczg\u00fcn|first2=Azer \u00d6|last3=Brem|first3=J\u00fcrgen|last4=McDonough|first4=Michael A.|last5=Rydzik|first5=Anna M.|last6=Abboud|first6=Martine I.|last7=Saral|first7=Ay\u015feg\u00fcl|last8=\u00c7i\u00e7ek|first8=Ay\u015feg\u00fcl \u00c7|last9=Sandalli|first9=Cemal|date=2016-03-01|title=Comparison of Verona Integron-Borne Metallo-\u03b2-Lactamase (VIM) Variants Reveals Differences in Stability and Inhibition Profiles|url=http://aac.asm.org/content/60/3/1377|journal=Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy|language=en|volume=60|issue=3|pages=1377\u20131384|doi=10.1128/AAC.01768-15|issn=0066-4804|pmc=4775916|pmid=26666919}}</ref>\n\n==== OXA (oxacillinase) group of \u03b2-lactamases (Class D) ====\nThe OXA group of \u03b2-lactamases occur mainly in Acinetobacter species and are divided into two clusters. OXA carbapenemases hydrolyse carbapenems very slowly ''in vitro'', and the high MICs seen for some Acinetobacter hosts (>64&nbsp;mg/L) may reflect secondary mechanisms. They are sometimes augmented in clinical isolates by additional resistance mechanisms, such as impermeability or efflux.  OXA carbapenemases also tend to have a reduced hydrolytic efficiency towards penicillins and cephalosporins.<ref name=\"pmid17374723\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Santillana E, Beceiro A, Bou G, Romero A | title = Crystal structure of the carbapenemase OXA-24 reveals insights into the mechanism of carbapenem hydrolysis | journal = Proc.

Moreover, one should suspect these strains when treatment with these agents for Gram-negative infections fails despite reported ''in vitro'' susceptibility. Once an ESBL-producing strain is detected, the laboratory should report it as \"resistant\" to all penicillins, cephalosporins, and aztreonam, even if it is tested (in vitro) as susceptible.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Associated resistance to [[aminoglycosides]] and [[trimethoprim]]-[[sulfamethoxazole]], as well as high frequency of co-existence of [[fluoroquinolone]] resistance, creates problems. Beta-lactamase inhibitors such as [[clavulanate]], [[sulbactam]], and [[tazobactam]] ''in vitro'' inhibit most ESBLs, but the clinical effectiveness of beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations cannot be relied on consistently for therapy. [[Cephamycins]] ([[cefoxitin]] and [[cefotetan]]) are not hydrolyzed by majority of ESBLs, but are hydrolyzed by associated AmpC-type \u03b2-lactamase.  Also, \u03b2-lactam/\u03b2-lactamase inhibitor combinations may not be effective against organisms that produce AmpC-type \u03b2-lactamase.  Sometimes these strains decrease the expression of outer membrane proteins, rendering them resistant to cephamycins. ''In vivo'' studies have yielded mixed results against ESBL-producing ''[[K. pneumoniae]]''. ([[Cefepime]], a fourth-generation cephalosporin, has demonstrated ''in vitro'' stability in the presence of many ESBL/AmpC strains.) Currently, [[carbapenems]] are, in general, regarded as the preferred agent for treatment of infections due to ESBL-producing organisms. Carbapenems are resistant to ESBL-mediated hydrolysis and exhibit excellent ''in vitro'' activity against strains of [[Enterobacteriaceae]] expressing ESBLs.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\n=== According to genes ===\n\n====ESBLs====\n\nStrains producing only ESBLs are susceptible to [[cephamycins]] and [[carbapenems]] ''in vitro'' and show little if any [[inoculum effect]] with these agents.\n\nFor organisms producing '''TEM''' and '''SHV''' type ESBLs, apparent ''in vitro'' sensitivity to [[cefepime]] and to [[piperacillin/tazobactam]] is common, but both drugs show an inoculum effect, with diminished susceptibility as the size of the inoculum is increased from 10<sup>5</sup> to 10<sup>7</sup> organisms.\n\nStrains with some '''CTX-M'''\u2013type and '''OXA'''-type ESBLs are resistant to [[cefepime]] on testing, despite the use of a standard inoculum.\n\n====Inhibitor-Resistant \u03b2-lactamases====\n\nAlthough the inhibitor-resistant TEM variants are resistant to inhibition by [[clavulanic acid]] and [[sulbactam]], thereby showing clinical resistance to the beta-lactam\u2014beta lactamase inhibitor combinations of [[amoxicillin]]-[[clavulanate]] ([[Co-amoxiclav]]), [[ticarcillin]]-[[clavulanate]], and [[ampicillin/sulbactam]], they remain susceptible to inhibition by [[tazobactam]] and subsequently the combination of [[piperacillin/tazobactam]].\n\n====AmpC====\n\nAmpC-producing strains are typically resistant to [[oxyimino-beta lactams]] and to [[cephamycins]] and are susceptible to [[carbapenems]]; however, diminished porin expression can make such a strain carbapenem-resistant as well.\n\n====Carbapenemases====\n\nStrains with '''IMP-, VIM-, and OXA'''-type carbapenemases usually remain susceptible. Resistance to non-beta-lactam antibiotics is common in strains making any of these enzymes, such that alternative options for non-beta-lactam therapy need to be determined by direct susceptibility testing. Resistance to [[fluoroquinolones]] and [[aminoglycosides]] is especially high.\n\n===According to species===\n\n====''Escherichia coli'' or ''Klebsiella''====\n\nFor infections caused by ESBL-producing ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' or ''[[Klebsiella]]'' species, treatment with [[imipenem]] or [[meropenem]] has been associated with the best outcomes in terms of survival and bacteriologic clearance. [[Cefepime]] and [[piperacillin/tazobactam]] have been less successful. [[Ceftriaxone]], [[cefotaxime]], and [[ceftazidime]] have failed even more often, despite the organism's susceptibility to the antibiotic ''in vitro''. Several reports have documented failure of [[cephamycin]] therapy as a result of resistance due to porin loss. Some patients have responded to [[aminoglycoside]] or [[Quinolone antibiotic|quinolone]] therapy, but, in a recent comparison of [[ciprofloxacin]] and [[imipenem]] for bacteremia involving an ESBL-producing ''[[K. pneumoniae]]'', [[imipenem]] produced the better outcome\n\n====''Pseudomonas aeruginosa''====\n\nThere have been few clinical studies to define the optimal therapy for infections caused by ESBL producing ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' strains.\n\n== Detection ==\n\nBeta-lactamase enzymatic activity can be detected using [[nitrocefin]], a chromogenic [[cephalosporin]] substrate which changes color from yellow to red upon beta-lactamase mediated hydrolysis.<ref name=\"pmid4208895\">{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Callaghan CH, Morris A, Kirby SM, Shingler AH | title = Novel method for detection of beta-lactamases by using a chromogenic cephalosporin substrate | journal = Antimicrob.

As the CX-HLS needed to be able to be loaded from the front, a door had to be included where the cockpit usually was.

Boeing believed that the scheme would be able to deliver a flexible and fast, carrier platform with global reach, particularly where other bases were not available. Modified versions of the 747-200 and Lockheed C-5A were considered as the base aircraft. The concept, which included a complementary 747 AWACS version with two reconnaissance \"microfighters\", was considered technically feasible in 1973.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/529372.pdf |title=Investigation of a Micro-Fighter / Airborne Aircraft Carrier Concept |date=September 1973 |publisher=Defense Technical Information Center |accessdate=November 21, 2015}}</ref>\n* '''[[Evergreen 747 Supertanker]]''' \u2013 A Boeing 747-200 modified as an aerial application platform for fire fighting using {{convert|20000|USgal|L}} of firefighting chemicals.<ref>[http://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgstc.nsf/0/3daa36596e85e7a58625721f00596da7/$FILE/ST01912LA.pdf \"Supplementary Type Certificate ST01912LA Installation and removal of internal tanks, associated systems and support structure for the aerial dispersant of liquids\"].

The center engine would have been fitted in the tail with an [[S-duct]] intake similar to the L-1011's. Overall, the 747 trijet would have had more payload, range, and passenger capacity than both of them. However, engineering studies showed that a major redesign of the 747 wing would be necessary. Maintaining the same 747 handling characteristics would be important to minimize pilot retraining. Boeing decided instead to pursue a shortened four-engine 747, resulting in the 747SP.<ref>Jenkins 2000, pp. 69\u201371.</ref>\n\n====747 ASB====\nBoeing announced the 747 ASB (''Advanced Short Body'') in 1986 as a response to the [[Airbus A340]] and the [[McDonnell Douglas MD-11]]. This aircraft design would have combined the advanced technology used on the [[Boeing 747-400|747-400]] with the foreshortened 747SP fuselage.

It took place on 25 October 1415 ([[Saint Crispin's Day]]) in the [[County of Saint-Pol]], [[Artois]], some 40&nbsp;km south of [[Calais]] (now [[Azincourt]] in northern France).{{sfn|Monstrelet |1853|p=340}}{{Ref label|b|b|none}} England's unexpected victory at Agincourt against a numerically superior French army boosted English morale and prestige, crippled France, and started a new period in the war during which the English began enjoying great military successes.\n\nAfter several decades of relative peace, the English had [[Hundred Years' War (1415\u201353)|renewed their war effort]] in 1415 amid the failure of negotiations with the French. In the ensuing campaign, many soldiers died due to disease and the English numbers dwindled; they tried to withdraw to [[Pale of Calais|English-held Calais]] but found their path blocked by a considerably larger French army. Despite the disadvantage, the following battle ended in an overwhelming tactical victory for the English.\n\nKing [[Henry V of England]] led his troops into battle and participated in hand-to-hand fighting. King [[Charles VI of France]] did not command the French army himself, as he suffered from severe psychotic illnesses with moderate mental incapacitation. Instead, the French were commanded by Constable [[Charles I of Albret|Charles d'Albret]] and various prominent French noblemen of the [[Armagnac (party)|Armagnac party]].\n\nThis battle is notable for the use of the [[English longbow]] in very large numbers, with the English and Welsh archers making up nearly 80 percent of Henry's army. The devastation of the French cavalry at their hands signaled the decline of cavalry and the increasing dominance of ranged weapons on the battlefield.{{Citation needed|reason=statement has been strengthened to fact from conjecture needing RS support|date=October 2018}}\n\nAgincourt is one of England's most celebrated victories and was one of the most important English triumphs in the Hundred Years' War, along with the [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy]] (1346) and [[Battle of Poitiers]] (1356). It forms the centrepiece of the play ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'' by [[William Shakespeare]].\n\n==Contemporary accounts==\nThe Battle of Agincourt is well documented by at least seven contemporary accounts, three from eyewitnesses. The approximate location of the battle has never been in dispute and the place remains relatively unaltered after 600 years. Immediately after the battle, Henry summoned the heralds of the two armies who had watched the battle together with principal French herald Montjoie, and they settled on the name of the battle as Azincourt after the nearest fortified place.{{sfn|Keegan|1976|p=86}} Two of the most frequently cited accounts come from Burgundian sources, one from [[Jean Le F\u00e8vre de Saint-Remy]] who was present at the battle, and the other from [[Enguerrand de Monstrelet]]. The English eyewitness account comes from the anonymous ''Gesta Henrici Quinti'', believed to be written by a chaplain in the King's household who would have been in the baggage train at the battle.{{sfn|Curry|2000|pp=22\u20136}} A recent re-appraisal of Henry's strategy of the Agincourt campaign incorporates these three accounts and argues that war was seen as a legal due process for solving the disagreement over claims to the French throne.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Honig|first1=Jan Willem|title=Reappraising Late Medieval Strategy: The Example of the 1415 Agincourt Campaign|journal=War in History|date=2012|volume=19|issue=123|pages=123\u2013151|url=http://wih.sagepub.com/content/19/2/123.abstract|accessdate=8 December 2014}} {{pn|date=August 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Campaign==\n{{Main article|Hundred Years War}}\n\n[[Henry V of England|Henry V]] invaded France following the failure of negotiations with the French. He claimed the title of King of France through his great-grandfather [[Edward III of England|Edward III]], although in practice the English kings were generally prepared to renounce this claim if the French would acknowledge the English claim on [[Aquitaine]] and other French lands (the terms of the [[Treaty of Br\u00e9tigny]]).{{sfn|Barker|2005|p=13}} He initially called a [[Magnum Concilium|Great Council]] in the spring of 1414 to discuss going to war with France, but the lords insisted that he should negotiate further and moderate his claims. In the following negotiations Henry said that he would give up his claim to the French throne if the French would pay the 1.6 million crowns outstanding from the ransom of [[John II of France|John II]] (who had been captured at the [[Battle of Poitiers (1356)|Battle of Poitiers]] in 1356), and concede English ownership of the lands of [[Normandy]], [[Touraine]], [[Anjou]], [[Duchy of Brittany|Brittany]] and [[County of Flanders|Flanders]], as well as [[Duchy of Aquitaine|Aquitaine]]. Henry would marry [[Catherine of Valois|Catherine]], the young daughter of [[Charles VI of France|Charles VI]], and receive a dowry of 2 million crowns. The French responded with what they considered the generous terms of marriage with Catherine, a dowry of 600,000 crowns, and an enlarged Aquitaine. By 1415, negotiations had ground to a halt, with the English claiming that the French had mocked their claims and ridiculed Henry himself.{{sfn|Barker|2005|pp=67\u201369}} In December 1414, the English [[Parliament of England|parliament]] was persuaded to grant Henry a \"double subsidy\", a tax at twice the traditional rate, to recover his inheritance from the French. On 19 April 1415, Henry again asked the Great Council to sanction war with France, and this time they agreed.{{sfn|Barker|2005|pp=107, 114}}\n\nHenry's army landed in northern France on 13 August 1415, carried by a fleet described by Shakespeare as \"a city on the inconstant billows dancing / For so appears this fleet majestical\", often reported to comprise 1,500 ships, but probably far smaller, and besieged the port of [[Harfleur]] with an army of about 12,000, and up to 20,000 horses.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/27/henry-v-agincourt-fleet-invasion-france Guardian newspaper:French correction: Henry V's Agincourt fleet was half as big, historian claims, 28 July 2015]</ref> The [[siege of Harfleur|siege]] took longer than expected. The town surrendered on 22 September, and the English army did not leave until 8 October. The campaign season was coming to an end, and the English army had suffered many casualties through disease. Rather than retire directly to England for the winter, with his costly expedition resulting in the capture of only one town, Henry decided to march most of his army (roughly 9,000) through [[Normandy]] to the port of [[Calais]], the English stronghold in northern France, to demonstrate by his presence in the territory at the head of an army that his right to rule in the duchy was more than a mere abstract legal and historical claim.{{sfn|Hibbert|1971|p=67}} He also intended the manoeuvre as a deliberate provocation to battle aimed at [[Louis, Dauphin of France, Duke of Guyenne|the dauphin]], who had failed to respond to Henry's personal challenge to combat at Harfleur.{{sfn|Barker|2005|p=219}}\n\nThe French had raised an army during the siege which assembled around [[Rouen]]. This was not strictly a [[feudal]] army, but an army paid through a system similar to the English. The French hoped to raise 9,000 troops, but the army was not ready in time to relieve Harfleur. After Henry V marched to the north, the French moved to block them along the [[Somme river|River Somme]]. They were successful for a time, forcing Henry to move south, away from Calais, to find a [[Ford (crossing)|ford]]. The English finally crossed the Somme south of [[P\u00e9ronne, Somme|P\u00e9ronne]], at [[B\u00e9thencourt-sur-Somme|B\u00e9thencourt]] and [[Voyennes]] {{sfn|Wylie|Waugh|1914|p=118}}{{sfn|Seward|1999|p=162}} and resumed marching north. Without a river obstacle to defend, the French were hesitant to force a battle. They shadowed Henry's army while calling a ''semonce des nobles'',<ref>{{cite web |title= Living dictionary of the French language|date=25 May 2013| url=http://dvlf.uchicago.edu/mot/semonce|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214091454/http://dvlf.uchicago.edu/mot/semonce |archivedate=14 December 2013}} {{verify source|date=August 2013}}</ref> calling on local nobles to join the army. By 24 October, both armies faced each other for battle, but the French declined, hoping for the arrival of more troops. The two armies spent the night of 24 October on open ground. The next day the French initiated negotiations as a delaying tactic, but Henry ordered his army to advance and to start a battle that, given the state of his army, he would have preferred to avoid, or to fight defensively: that was how [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy|Cr\u00e9cy]] and the other famous longbow victories had been won. The English had very little food, had marched {{convert|260|mi}} in two and a half weeks, were suffering from sickness such as [[dysentery]], and faced much larger numbers of well-equipped French men at arms. The French army blocked Henry's way to the safety of Calais, however, and delaying battle would only further weaken his tired army and allow more French troops to arrive.{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|pp=436\u20137}}\n\n==Battle==\n===Battlefield===\nThe location of the battle is not precisely fixed in contemporary accounts. Most authors believe it was fought in the narrow strip of open land formed between the woods of [[Tramecourt]] and Azincourt (close to the modern village of [[Azincourt]]). However, the lack of archaeological evidence at this traditional site has led to suggestions it was fought to the west of Azincourt.<ref>Sutherland (2015)</ref>\n\n====English deployment====\n[[File:Map Agincort.svg|thumb|The battle of Agincourt]]\nEarly on the 25th, Henry deployed his army (approximately 1,500 [[man-at-arms|men-at-arms]] and 7,000 [[English longbow|longbowmen]]) across a {{convert|750|yd|adj=on}} part of the [[defile (geography)|defile]]. The army was organised into three \"battles\" or divisions: the [[Vanguard (military formation)|vanguard]], led by the [[Edward of Norwich, 2nd Duke of York|Duke of York]]; the main battle led by Henry himself; and the [[Rear guard|rearguard]], led by [[Thomas de Camoys, 1st Baron Camoys|Lord Camoys]]. In addition, [[Thomas Erpingham|Sir Thomas Erpingham]], one of Henry's most experienced household knights, had a role in marshalling the archers.{{sfn|Barker|2005|pp=271, 290}} It is likely that the English adopted their usual battle line of longbowmen on either flank, with men-at-arms and knights in the centre. They might also have deployed some archers in the centre of the line. The English men-at-arms in plate and mail were placed shoulder to shoulder four deep. The English and Welsh archers on the flanks drove pointed wooden [[archer's stake|stakes]], or palings, into the ground at an angle to force [[cavalry]] to veer off. This use of stakes could have been inspired by the [[Battle of Nicopolis]] of 1396, where forces of the [[Ottoman Empire]] used the tactic against French cavalry.{{Ref label|c|c|none}}\n\nThe English made their [[Sacrament of Penance|confessions]] before the battle, as was customary.{{sfn|Curry|2006|p=166}} Henry, worried about the enemy launching surprise raids, and wanting his troops to remain focused, ordered all his men to spend the night before the battle in silence, on pain of having an ear cut off. He told his men that he would rather die in the coming battle than be captured and ransomed.{{sfn|Barker|2005|pp=267\u20138}}\n\nHenry made a speech emphasising the justness of his cause, and reminding his army of previous great defeats the kings of England had inflicted on the French. The [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundian]] sources have him concluding the speech by telling his men that the French had boasted that they would cut off two fingers from the right hand of every archer, so that he could never draw a longbow again. Whether this was true is open to question; as previously noted, death was the normal fate of any soldier who could not be ransomed.{{sfn|Barker|2005|pp=283\u20134}}\n\n====French deployment====\nThe French force was not only larger than that of the English, but their noble men-at-arms would have considered themselves superior to the large number of archers in the English army, whom the French (based on their experience in recent memory of using and facing archers) considered relatively insignificant.{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|p=422}} For example, the chronicler Edmond de Dyntner stated that there were \"ten French nobles against one English\", ignoring the archers completely.{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|p=422}} Several French accounts emphasise that the French leaders were so eager to defeat the English (and win the ransoms of the English men-at-arms) that they insisted on being in the first line; as one of the contemporary accounts put it: \"All the lords wanted to be in the vanguard, against the opinion of the constable and the experienced knights.\"{{sfn|Rogers|2008b|p=107}}\n\nThe French were arrayed in three lines or \"battles\". The first line was led by Constable d'Albret, [[Marshal of France|Marshal]] [[Jean Le Maingre|Boucicault]], and the [[Charles, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|Dukes of Orl\u00e9ans]] and [[John I, Duke of Bourbon|Bourbon]], with attached cavalry wings under the [[Louis, Count of Vend\u00f4me|Count of Vend\u00f4me]] and Sir Clignet de Brebant. The second line was commanded by the [[Edward III of Bar|Dukes of Bar]] and [[John I, Duke of Alen\u00e7on|Alen\u00e7on]] and the [[Philip II, Count of Nevers|Count of Nevers]]. The third line was under the [[Counts of Dammartin]] and Fauconberg.{{sfn|Barker|2005|pp=276\u20138}} The Burgundian chronicler [[Jean de Wavrin]] said there were 8,000 men-at-arms, 4,000 archers and 1,500 crossbowmen in the vanguard, with two wings of 600 and 800 mounted men-at-arms, and a main battle comprising \"as many knights, esquires and archers as in the vanguard\", with the rearguard containing \"all of the rest of the men-at-arms\".<ref>[http://www.deremilitari.org/RESOURCES/SOURCES/agincourt.htm ''Battle of Agincourt 1415'', Wavrin]</ref> The Herald of Berry gave figures of 4,800 men-at-arms in the first line, 3,000 men in the second line, with two \"wings\" containing 600 mounted men-at-arms each, and a total of \"10,000 men-at-arms\",<ref>Quoted in {{harvnb|Curry|2000|p=181}}.</ref> but does not mention a third line.\n\nThousands of troops appear to have been in the rearguard, containing servants and commoners whom the French were either unable or unwilling to deploy. Wavrin gives the total French army size as 50,000: \"They had plenty of archers and crossbowmen but nobody wanted to let them fire {{sic}}. The reason for this was that the site was so narrow that there was only enough room for the men-at-arms.\"<ref>Quoted in {{harvnb|Curry|2000|p=159}}.</ref> A different source says that the French did not even deploy 4,000 of the best crossbowmen \"on the pretext they had no need of their help\".<ref>Quoted in {{harvnb|Curry|2000|p=106}}.</ref>\n\n===Terrain===\nThe field of battle was arguably the most significant factor in deciding the outcome. The recently ploughed land hemmed in by dense woodland favoured the English, both because of its narrowness, and because of the thick mud through which the French knights had to walk.{{sfn|Wason|2004|p=74}}{{sfn|Holmes|1996|p=48}}\n\nAccounts of the battle describe the French engaging the English men-at-arms before being rushed from the sides by the longbowmen as the [[m\u00eal\u00e9e]] developed. The English account in the ''Gesta Henrici'' says: \"For when some of them, killed when battle was first joined, fall at the front, so great was the undisciplined violence and pressure of the mass of men behind them that the living fell on top of the dead, and others falling on top of the living were killed as well.\"{{sfn|Curry|2000|p=37}}\n\nAlthough the French initially pushed the English back, they became so closely packed that they were described as having trouble using their weapons properly. The French monk of St. Denis says: \"Their vanguard, composed of about 5,000 men, found itself at first so tightly packed that those who were in the third rank could scarcely use their swords,\"<ref>Quoted in {{harvnb|Curry|2000|p=107}}.</ref> and the Burgundian sources have a similar passage.\n\nAs the battle was fought on a recently ploughed field, and there had recently been heavy rain leaving it very muddy, it proved very tiring to walk through in full plate armour. The French monk of St. Denis describes the French troops as \"marching through the middle of the mud where they sank up to their knees. So they were already overcome with fatigue even before they advanced against the enemy\". The deep, soft mud particularly favoured the English force because, once knocked to the ground, the heavily armoured French knights had a hard time getting back up to fight in the m\u00eal\u00e9e. Barker states that some knights, encumbered by their armour, actually drowned in their helmets.{{sfn|Barker|2005|p=300}}\n\n===Fighting===\n====Opening moves====\n[[File:Morning of the Battle of Agincourt, 25th October 1415.PNG|thumb|''Morning of the Battle of Agincourt, 25 October 1415'', painted by Sir [[John Gilbert (painter)|John Gilbert]] in the 19th century]]\nOn the morning of 25 October, the French were still waiting for additional troops to arrive. The [[Anthony, Duke of Brabant|Duke of Brabant]] (about 2,000 men),{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|p=449}} the [[Louis II of Naples|Duke of Anjou]] (about 600 men),{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|p=449}} and the [[John VI, Duke of Brittany|Duke of Brittany]] (6,000 men, according to Monstrelet),{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|p=416}} were all marching to join the army.\n\nFor three hours after sunrise there was no fighting. Military textbooks of the time stated: \"Everywhere and on all occasions that foot soldiers march against their enemy face to face, those who march lose and those who remain standing still and holding firm win.\"{{sfn|Barker|2005|p=287}} On top of this, the French were expecting thousands of men to join them if they waited. They were blocking Henry's retreat, and were perfectly happy to wait for as long as it took. There had even been a suggestion that the English would run away rather than give battle when they saw that they would be fighting so many French princes.{{sfn|Barker|2005|p=288}}\n\nHenry's men, on the other hand, were already very weary from hunger, illness and marching. Even though Henry knew as well as the French did that his army would perform better on the defensive, he was eventually forced to take a calculated risk, and move his army further forward to start the battle.{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|pp=436\u20137}} This entailed abandoning his chosen position and pulling out, advancing, and then re-installing the long sharpened wooden stakes pointed outwards toward the enemy, which helped protect the longbowmen from cavalry charges.{{sfn|Keegan|1976|pp=90\u20131}} (The use of stakes was an innovation for the English: during the [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy]], for example, the archers had been instead protected by pits and other obstacles.{{sfn|Bennett|1994}})\n\nThe tightness of the terrain also seems to have restricted the planned deployment of the French forces. The French had originally drawn up a battle plan that had archers and crossbowmen in front of their men-at-arms, with a cavalry force at the rear specifically designed to \"fall upon the archers, and use their force to break them,\"{{sfn|Barker|2005|p=273}} but in the event, the French archers and crossbowmen were deployed ''behind'' and to the sides of the men-at-arms (where they seem to have played almost no part, except possibly for an initial volley of arrows at the start of the battle). The cavalry force, which could have devastated the English line if it had attacked while they moved their stakes, charged only ''after'' the initial volley of arrows from the English. It is unclear whether the delay occurred because the French were hoping the English would launch a frontal assault (and were surprised when the English instead started shooting from their new defensive position), or whether the French mounted knights instead did not react quickly enough to the English advance. French chroniclers agree that when the mounted charge did come, it did not contain as many men as it should have; Gilles le Bouvier states that some had wandered off to warm themselves and others were walking or feeding their horses.{{sfn|Barker|2005|p=291}}\n\n====French cavalry attack====\nThe French cavalry, despite being disorganised and not at full numbers, charged towards the longbowmen, but it was a disaster, with the French knights unable to outflank the longbowmen (because of the encroaching woodland) and unable to charge through the forest of sharpened stakes that protected the archers. [[John Keegan]] argues that the longbows' main influence on the battle at this point was injuries to horses: armoured only on the head, many horses would have become dangerously out of control when struck in the back or flank from the high-elevation long range shots used as the charge started.{{sfn|Keegan|1976|pp=92\u20136}} The mounted charge and subsequent retreat churned up the already muddy terrain between the French and the English. Juliet Barker quotes a contemporary account by a monk of [[Saint Denis Basilica|St. Denis]] who reports how the wounded and panicking horses galloped through the advancing infantry, scattering them and trampling them down in their headlong flight from the battlefield.{{sfn|Barker|2005|p=293}}\n\n====Main French assault====\n[[File:King Henry V at the Battle of Agincourt, 1415.png|thumb|left|upright=1.2|King Henry V at the Battle of Agincourt, 1415, by Sir John Gilbert in the 19th century.]]\nThe plate armour of the French men-at-arms allowed them to close the 1,000 yards or so to the English lines while being under what the French monk of Saint Denis described as \"a terrifying hail of arrow shot\". A complete coat of plate was considered such good protection that shields were generally not used,{{sfn|Nicholson|2004|p=109}} although the Burgundian contemporary sources distinguish between Frenchmen who used shields and those who did not, and Rogers has suggested that the front elements of the French force used axes and shields.{{sfn|Rogers|2008|p=90}} Modern historians are divided on how effective the longbow fire would have been against plate armour of the time, with some suggesting that arrows could not penetrate, especially the better quality steel armour, but others suggesting arrows could penetrate, especially the poorer quality [[wrought iron]] armour. Rogers suggested that the longbow could penetrate a wrought iron breastplate at short range and penetrate the thinner armour on the limbs even at {{convert|220|yd}}. He considered a knight in the best-quality steel armour invulnerable to an arrow on the breastplate or top of the helmet, but vulnerable to shots hitting the limbs, particularly at close range.{{sfn|Rogers|2008|pp= 110\u201313}} In any case, to protect themselves as much as possible from the arrows, the French had to lower their visors and bend their helmeted heads to avoid being shot in the face, as the eye- and air-holes in their helmets were among the weakest points in the armour. This head-lowered position restricted their breathing and their vision. Then they had to walk a few hundred yards (metres) through thick mud and a press of comrades while wearing armour weighing {{convert|50|\u2013|60|lb}}, gathering sticky clay all the way. Increasingly, they had to walk around or over fallen comrades.{{sfn|Barker|2005|pp=297\u2013298}}\n[[File:Vigiles du roi Charles VII 57.jpg|thumb|right|Miniature from Vigiles du roi Charles VII. The battle of Azincourt 1415.]]\nThe surviving French men-at-arms reached the front of the English line and pushed it back, with the longbowmen on the flanks continuing to shoot at point-blank range. When the archers ran out of arrows, they dropped their bows and using [[hatchet]]s, [[sword]]s and the [[mallet]]s they had used to drive their stakes in, attacked the now disordered, fatigued and wounded French men-at-arms massed in front of them. The French could not cope with the thousands of lightly armoured longbowmen assailants (who were much less hindered by the mud and weight of their armour) combined with the English men-at-arms. The impact of thousands of arrows, combined with the slog in heavy armour through the mud, the heat and difficulty breathing in plate armour with the visor down<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Askew |first1=Graham N. |last2=Formenti |first2=Federico|last3= Minetti|first3=Alberto E. |year=2012 |title=Limitations imposed by wearing armour on Medieval soldiers' locomotor performance |journal=Proc.

As the [[Melee|m\u00eal\u00e9e]] developed, the French second line also joined the attack, but they too were swallowed up, with the narrow terrain meaning the extra numbers could not be used effectively. Rogers suggested that the French at the back of their deep formation would have been attempting to literally add their weight to the advance, without realising that they were hindering the ability of those at the front to manoeuvre and fight by pushing them into the English formation of lancepoints. After the initial wave, the French would have had to fight over and on the bodies of those who had fallen before them. In such a \"press\" of thousands of men, Rogers suggested that many could have suffocated in their armour, as was described by several sources, and which was also known to have happened in other battles.{{sfn|Rogers|2008|pp=95\u20138}}\n\nThe French men-at-arms were taken prisoner or killed in the thousands. The fighting lasted about three hours, but eventually the leaders of the second line were killed or captured, as those of the first line had been. The English ''Gesta Henrici'' described three great heaps of the slain around the three main English standards.{{sfn|Curry|2000|p=37}}\nAccording to contemporary English accounts, Henry fought hand to hand. Upon hearing that his youngest brother [[Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester]] had been wounded in the groin, Henry took his household guard and stood over his brother, in the front rank of the fighting, until Humphrey could be dragged to safety. The king received an axe blow to the head, which knocked off a piece of the crown that formed part of his helmet.{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|p=443}}\n\n====Attack on the English baggage train====\n[[File:King Henry V at the Battle of Agincourt.jpg|thumb|upright|1915 depiction of Henry V at the Battle of Agincourt : The King wears on this surcoat the Royal Arms of England, quartered with the Fleur de Lys of France as a symbol of his claim to the throne of France.]]\nThe only French success was an attack on the lightly protected English baggage train, with Ysembart d'Azincourt (leading a small number of men-at-arms and [[Squire|varlets]] plus about 600 peasants) seizing some of Henry's personal treasures, including a crown.{{sfn|Curry|2006|pp=207\u20139}} Whether this was part of a deliberate French plan or an act of local [[brigandage]] is unclear from the sources. Certainly, d'Azincourt was a local knight but he might have been chosen to lead the attack because of his local knowledge and the lack of availability of a more senior soldier.{{sfn|Barker|2005|p=308}} In some accounts the attack happened towards the end of the battle, and led the English to think they were being attacked from the rear. Barker, following the ''Gesta Henrici'', believed to have been written by an English chaplain who was actually in the baggage train, concluded that the attack happened at the ''start'' of the battle.{{sfn|Barker|2005|p=308}}\n\n====Henry orders the killing of the prisoners====\nRegardless of when the baggage assault happened, at some point after the initial English victory, Henry became alarmed that the French were regrouping for another attack. The ''Gesta Henrici'' places this after the English had overcome the onslaught of the French men-at-arms and the weary English troops were eyeing the French rearguard (\"in incomparable number and still fresh\"{{sfn|Curry|2000|p=37}}). Le F\u00e8vre and Wavrin similarly say that it was signs of the French rearguard regrouping and \"marching forward in battle order\" which made the English think they were still in danger.{{sfn|Curry|2000|p=163}} A slaughter of the French prisoners ensued. It seems it was purely a decision of Henry, since the English knights found it contrary to [[chivalry]], and contrary to their interests to kill valuable hostages for whom it was commonplace to ask [[ransom]]. Henry threatened to hang whoever did not obey his orders.\n\nIn any event, Henry ordered the slaughter of what were perhaps several thousand French prisoners, sparing only the highest ranked (presumably those most likely to fetch a large ransom under the chivalric system of warfare). According to most chroniclers, Henry's fear was that the prisoners (who, in an unusual turn of events, actually outnumbered their captors) would realize their advantage in numbers, rearm themselves with the weapons strewn about the field and overwhelm the exhausted English forces. Contemporary chroniclers did not criticise him for it.{{sfn|Barker|2005|pp=302\u2013305}} In his study of the battle, John Keegan{{sfn|Keegan|1976|pp=107\u201312}} argued that the main aim was not to actually kill the French knights but rather to terrorise them into submission and quell any possibility they might resume the fight, which would probably have caused the uncommitted French reserve forces to join the fray, as well. Such an event would have posed a risk to the still-outnumbered English and could have easily turned a stunning victory into a mutually-destructive defeat, as the English forces were now largely intermingled with the French and would have suffered grievously from the arrows of their own longbowmen had they needed to resume shooting. Keegan also speculated that due to the relatively low number of archers actually involved in killing the French knights (roughly 200 by his estimate), together with the refusal of the English knights to assist in a duty they saw as distastefully unchivalrous and combined with the sheer difficulty of killing such a large number of prisoners in such a short space of time, the actual number of French knights killed might not have even reached the hundreds before the reserves fled the field and Henry called an end to the slaughter.{{sfn|Keegan|1976|p=112}}\n\n===Aftermath===\nThe lack of reliable sources makes it impossible to give a precise figure for the French and English [[Casualty (person)|casualties]] (dead, wounded, taken prisoner). However, it is clear that though the English were outnumbered, their losses were far lower than those of the French. The French sources all give 4,000\u201310,000 French dead, with up to 1,600 English dead. The lowest ratio in these French sources has the French losing six times more men than the English. It has been possible to name at least 500 individuals from the French army killed in the battle and over 300 prisoners.<ref>Curry & Mercer (2015), p.165</ref>\n\nThe English sources vary between about 1,500 and 11,000 for the French dead, with English dead put at no more than 100.<ref>All figures on number of dead from table in {{harvnb|Curry|2000|p=12}}.</ref> Barker identifies from the available records \"at least\" 112 Englishmen killed in the fighting, including [[Edward of Norwich, 2nd Duke of York]], a grandson of [[Edward III of England|Edward III]].{{sfn|Barker|2005|p=320}} One widely used estimate puts the English casualties at 450, a significant number in an army of about 8,500, but far fewer than the thousands the French lost, nearly all of whom were killed or captured. Using the lowest French estimate of their own dead of 4,000 would imply a ratio of nearly 9 to 1 in favour of the English, or over 10 to 1 if the prisoners are included.<ref>Casualty estimates from the Religeux of St Denis and Jean Juvenal des Ursins given in {{harvnb|Curry|2000|p=12}}.</ref>\n\nThe French suffered heavily. Three [[duke]]s, at least eight [[count]]s, a [[viscount]], and an [[archbishop]] died, along with numerous other nobles. Of the great royal office holders, France lost her Constable, Admiral, Master of the Crossbowmen and ''pr\u00e9v\u00f4t'' of the marshals.{{sfn|Barker|2005|pp=''x'', 321, 323}} The ''[[bailli]]s'' of nine major northern towns were killed, often along with their sons, relatives and supporters. In the words of Juliet Barker, the battle \"cut a great swath through the natural leaders of French society in [[County of Artois|Artois]], [[Ponthieu]], [[Normandy]], [[Picardy]].\" {{sfn|Barker|2005|pp=322\u20133}} Estimates of the number of prisoners vary between 700 and 2,200, amongst them the [[Charles, duc d'Orl\u00e9ans|Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]] (the famous poet Charles d'Orl\u00e9ans) and [[Jean Le Maingre]] (known as Boucicault), [[Marshal of France]].{{sfn|Barker|2005|pp=337, 367, 368}}\n\nAlthough the victory had been militarily decisive, its impact was complex. It did not lead to further English conquests immediately as Henry's priority was to return to England, which he did on 16 November, to be received in triumph in London on the 23rd.{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|pp=475, 479}} Henry returned a conquering hero, in the eyes of his subjects and European powers outside France, blessed by God. It established the legitimacy of the Lancastrian monarchy and the future campaigns of Henry to pursue his \"rights and privileges\" in France.{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|pp=547\u20139}} Other benefits to the English were longer term. Very quickly after the battle, the fragile truce between the [[Armagnac (party)|Armagnac]] and [[Burgundian (party)|Burgundian]] factions broke down. The brunt of the battle had fallen on the Armagnacs and it was they who suffered the majority of senior casualties and carried the blame for the defeat. The Burgundians seized on the opportunity and within 10 days of the battle had mustered their armies and marched on Paris.{{sfn|Barker|2005|p=354}} This lack of unity in France allowed Henry eighteen months to prepare militarily and politically for a renewed campaign. When that campaign took place, it was made easier by the damage done to the political and military structures of Normandy by the battle.{{sfn|Barker|2005|p=381}}\n\n===Notable casualties===\n====French====\nNotable casualties (most named by [[Enguerrand de Monstrelet]]{{sfn|Monstrelet|1853|loc=[{{google books|D-4DAAAAQAAJ|pg=343|plainurl=yes}} ch. 147]}}) include:<ref>[http://fr.geneawiki.com/index.php/1415 For a fuller list of French casualties, see]</ref>\n\nLeading officers:\n* [[Charles d'Albret|Charles I d'Albret]], [[Count of Dreux]], the [[Constable of France]]{{sfn|Walsingham|2005|p=412}}\n* [[Jacques de Ch\u00e2tillon de Dampi\u00e8re]], Lord of Dampierre, the [[Admiral of France]]\n* [[David de Rambures]], the Grand [[Master of Crossbowmen]] (along with his three youngest sons)\n* Guichard Dauphin, Master of the Royal Household\n\nThree dukes:\n* [[Antoine, Duke of Brabant|Antoine of Burgundy]], [[Duke of Brabant|Duke of Brabant and Limburg]], and [[Elisabeth, Duchess of Luxembourg|consort]] [[Duke of Luxembourg]]{{sfn|Walsingham|2005|p=412}} (a brother of [[John the Fearless]], [[Duke of Burgundy]])\n* [[John I of Alen\u00e7on|John I]], [[Duke of Alen\u00e7on]]-[[Count of Perche|Perche]],{{sfn|Walsingham|2005|p=412}} the second-in-command after d'Albret.\n* [[Edward III of Bar|Edward III]], [[Duke of Bar]]{{sfn|Walsingham|2005|p=412}} (along with his brother and nephew)\n\nSix counts (seven with d'Albret):\n* [[Philip II, Count of Nevers|Philip of Burgundy]], [[Count of Nevers]] and [[Counts and dukes of Rethel|Rethel]] (another brother of John the Fearless)\n* [[Frederick of Lorraine, Count of Vaudemont|Frederick of Lorraine]], [[Count of Vaud\u00e9mont]] (brother of [[Charles II, Duke of Lorraine|Charles II]], [[Duke of Lorraine]])\n* [[Robert of Bar, Count of Marle and Soissons|Robert of Bar]], Count of Marle and [[Count of Soissons|Soissons]] (nephew of Edward III, Duke of Bar).\n* John VI, [[Count of Roucy]],\n* Edward II, Count of Grandpr\u00e9\n* Henry II, Count of Bl\u00e2mont\n\nand some 90 bannerets and others, including:\n* Jean de Montaigu, [[Archbishop of Sens]]\n* [[John of Bar]], Lord of Puisaye (brother of Edward III of Bar)\n* [[Jean I de Cro\u00ff]], Lord of Cro\u00ff-d'Araines (along with two of his sons, John and Archambaud)\n* Jean de B\u00e9thune, Lord of Marueil\n* Gallois de Fougi\u00e8res, [[Provost Marshal]], commemorated as the first French [[gendarme]] to lose his life in battle.<ref>Gilliot (2015)</ref>\n* [[Jean V de Hangest]] \u2013 Consular to the [[Grand Chamberlain of France]]\n*[[Jean IV de Noyelles]], Seigneur de Calonne, de Sailly, de Ricouart, Vicomte de Langle, Chambellan du Duc (along with two of his brothers, Lancelot and Pierre)\n* [[Jan I van Brederode]]\n\n====English====\nNotable casualties included:\n* [[Edward of Norwich, 2nd Duke of York]] (b. 1373)<ref>Rosemary Horrox, \u2018Edward, second duke of York (c.1373\u20131415)\u2019, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/22356, accessed 14 March 2011]</ref>\n* [[Michael de la Pole, 3rd Earl of Suffolk]]<ref>Simon Walker, \u2018Pole, Michael de la, second earl of Suffolk (1367/8\u20131415)\u2019, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2008 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/22453, accessed 14 March 2011]</ref>\n* [[Dafydd Gam]] (Davy Gam) Welsh hero who reputedly saved Henry V's life at Agincourt<ref>T.

The 1911 ''Britannica'' use somewhat different figures of 6,000 archers, 1,000 men-at-arms and \"a few thousands of other foot\" for the English, with the French outnumbering them by \"at least four times\".{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=375}}\n\nWhile not necessarily agreeing with the exact numbers Curry uses, Bertrand Schnerb, a professor of medieval history at the University of Lille, states the French probably had 12,000\u201315,000 troops.{{sfn|Glanz|2009}} Ian Mortimer, in his 2009 book ''1415: Henry V's Year of Glory'', notes how Curry \"minimises French numbers (by limiting her figures to those in the basic army and a few specific additional companies) and maximises English numbers (by assuming the numbers sent home from Harfleur were no greater than sick lists)\", but agrees that previous estimates have exaggerated the odds, and suggests that \"the most extreme imbalance which is credible is fifteen thousand French troops against 8,100 English: a ratio of about two-to-one\".{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|p=566}}\n\nHowever, Clifford J. Rogers, professor of history at the United States Military Academy at West Point, has recently argued that archival records are too incomplete to substantially change his view that the English were outnumbered about 4\u20131.{{sfn|Glanz|2009}}{{sfn|Rogers|2008a|pp=114\u201321}} Juliet Barker also disagrees with Curry's arguments in the acknowledgements section of her 2005 book on Agincourt, saying: \"Surviving administrative records on both sides, but especially the French, are simply too incomplete to support [Curry's] assertion that nine thousand English were pitted against an army only twelve thousand strong. And if the differential really was as low as three to four then this makes a nonsense of the course of the battle as described by eyewitnesses and contemporaries.\"{{sfn|Barker|2005|p=''xvi''}}\n\nThose supporting a greater imbalance have generally put more store by contemporary (and especially eyewitness) accounts. The ''Gesta Henrici'' gives plausible figures for the English of 5,000 archers and 900 men-at-arms, but Mortimer notes it is \"wildly inaccurate\" in stating the English were outnumbered 30\u20131, and there have also been doubts as to how much it was written as propaganda for Henry V. The proportions also seem incorrect, as from surviving records we know that Henry set out with about four times as many archers as men-at-arms, not five and a half times as many. Those who have supported the Gesta figures for the English army have generally thought that although the English army may have left Harfleur with eight or nine thousand men, it is plausible that after weeks of campaigning and disease in hostile territory they would have lost two or three thousand fighting men; however Mortimer states: \"Despite the trials of the march, Henry had lost very few men to illness or death; and we have independent testimony that no more than 160 had been captured on the way.\" {{sfn|Mortimer|2009|p=565}}\n\nAs Mortimer notes, the Burgundian numbers for the size of the French vanguard of 8,000 men-at-arms in the vanguard with 1,400 (or 2,400) men-at-arms in the wings correspond roughly with the figures of ten thousand men-at-arms recorded by the duke of Berry's herald. The Burgundians also recorded 4,000 archers and 1,500 crossbowmen in the \"vanguard\", which would suggest \"fourteen or fifteen thousand fighting men\".{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|p=565}} (It should be noted that the Burgundians actually give the total size of the French army as an implausible 50,000,{{sfn|Curry|2000|p=12}} and the numbers they use do not correspond closely to the odds they describe. Using very similar numbers, Jean Le Fevre states that the English were outnumbered 3\u20131, whereas Wavrin states that the English were outnumbered 6\u20131.{{sfn|Curry|2000|p=157}})\n\nOne particular cause of confusion may have been the number of servants on both sides. Mortimer suggests that because there were a much higher proportion of men-at-arms on the French side, the number of non-combatants was much higher. Each man-at-arms could be expected to have a page, who would have ridden one of his spare horses. If the French army had an extra 10,000 mounted men (as opposed to only 1,500 extra for the English), then \"the English probably did see an army about three times the size of their own fighting force\".{{sfn|Mortimer|2009|pp=421\u20132}}\n\nIt is open to debate whether these should all be counted as non-combatants; Rogers (for example) accepts that the French probably had about 10,000 men-at-arms, but explicitly includes one \"gros valet\" (an armed, armoured and mounted military servant) per French man-at-arms in his calculation of the odds.{{sfn|Rogers|2008|pp=60\u20132}}\n\n==Popular representations==\n[[File:Agincourtcarol.jpg|thumb|The 15th century [[Agincourt Carol]]]]\n;Music\nSoon after the English victory at Agincourt, a number of popular folk songs were created about the battle, the most famous being the \"[[Agincourt Carol]]\", produced in the first half of the 15th century.{{sfn|Curry|2000|p=280\u20133}} Other ballads followed, including \"[[King Henry Fifth's Conquest of France]]\", raising the popular prominence of particular events mentioned only in passing by the original chroniclers, such as the gift of tennis balls before the campaign.{{sfn|Woolf|2003|p=323}}\n\n;Literature\nThe most famous cultural depiction of the battle today is [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'', written in 1599. The play focuses on the pressures of kingship, the tensions between how a king should ''appear'' \u2013 chivalric, honest, and just \u2013 and how a king must sometimes ''act'' \u2013 [[Machiavellian]] and ruthless.{{sfn|Cantor|2006|p=15}} Shakespeare illustrates these tensions by depicting Henry's decision to kill some of the French prisoners, whilst attempting to justify it and distance himself from the event. This moment of the battle is portrayed both as a break with the traditions of chivalry and as key example of the paradox of kingship.{{sfn|Cantor|2006|pp=21\u20132}}\n\nShakespeare's depiction of the battle also plays on the theme of modernity. He contrasts the modern, English king and his army with the medieval, chivalric, older model of the French.{{sfn|Cantor|2006|p=20}}\n\nShakespeare's play presented Henry as leading a truly English force into battle, playing on the importance of the link between the monarch and the common soldiers in the fight.{{sfn|Cantor|2006|p=16}} The original play does not, however, feature any scenes of the actual battle itself, leading critic Rose Zimbardo to characterise it as \"full of warfare, yet empty of conflict.\"{{sfn|Hatchuel|2008|p=193}}\n\nThe play introduced the famous [[St Crispin's Day Speech]], considered one of Shakespeare's most heroic speeches, in which Henry delivers movingly to his soldiers just before the battle, urging his \"band of brothers\" to stand together in the forthcoming fight.{{sfn|Margolies|2006|p=149}} Critic David Margolies describes how it \"oozes honour, military glory, love of country and self-sacrifice\", and forms one of the first instances of English literature linking solidarity and comradeship to success in battle.{{sfn|Margolies|2006|p=149}}{{sfn|Adams|2002|p=31}} Partially as a result, the battle was used as a metaphor at the beginning of the [[First World War]], when the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]]'s attempts to stop the German advances were widely likened to it.{{sfn|Adams|2002|p=183}}\n;Films\nShakespeare's version of the battle of Agincourt has been turned into (several minor and) two major films, starring [[Laurence Olivier]] in [[Henry V (1944 film)|1944]] and [[Kenneth Branagh]] in [[Henry V (1989 film)|1989]]. Made just prior to the invasion of Normandy, Olivier's rendition gives the battle what Sarah Hatchuel has termed an \"exhilarating and heroic\" tone, with an artificial, cinematic look to the battle scenes.{{sfn|Hatchuel|2008|pp=194\u20135}} Branagh's version gives a longer, more [[Realism (arts)|realist]] portrayal of the battle itself, drawing on both historical sources and images from the [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] and [[Falkland War]]s.{{sfn|Hatchuel|2008|p=195}} In his 2007 film adaptation, director Peter Babakitis uses digital effects to exaggerate realist features during the battle scenes, producing a more ''[[Experimental film|avant-garde]]'' interpretation of the fighting at Agincourt.{{sfn|Hatchuel|2008|p=200}} \n;Mock trial\nThe battle remains an important symbol in popular culture. For example, a mock trial of Henry V for the crimes associated with the slaughter of the prisoners was held in Washington, D.C. in March 2010, drawing from both the historical record and Shakespeare's play. Participating as judges were Justices [[Samuel Alito]] and [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]]. The trial ranged widely over whether there was just cause for war and not simply the prisoner issue. Although an audience vote was \"too close to call\", Henry was unanimously found guilty by the court on the basis of \"evolving standards of civil society\".<ref name=\"mock-trial-cspan\">{{cite web | url=http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/id/221111 | title=Judgment at Agincourt | date=16 March 2010 | website=[[C-SPAN]] }} link to video</ref><ref name=\"mock-trial-cd\">{{cite web | url=http://dctheatrescene.com/2010/03/18/high-court-rules-for-french-at-agincourt/ | title=High Court Rules for French at Agincourt | website=DC Theater Scene | first=Tim | last=Treanor | date=18 March 2010 }}</ref><ref name=\"mock-trial-lawj\">{{cite web | url=http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1202446381186 | title=High Court Justices, Legal Luminaries Debate Shakespeare's 'Henry V' | last=Jones | first=Andy | website=[[National Law Journal]] | date=8 March 2010}}</ref>\n\n{{wide image|AGINCOURT.hto3.jpg|1100px|Battlefield today|left}}\n\n==Azincourt today==\n[[File:Agincourt Memorial.jpg|thumb|left|Agincourt Memorial]]\n[[File:Agincourt archers memorial.jpg|thumb|A list of English archers killed at Azincourt, as recorded in the village's museum]]\nThere is a modern museum in Azincourt village dedicated to the battle.<ref>[http://illucolor.fr/7_vallees_comm/Azincourt/index.html Agincourt Museum]</ref> The museum lists the names of combatants of both sides who died in the battle.\n\n==See also==\n* [[V sign]], for more on the \"two-finger salute\" which legends claim derives from the gestures of longbowmen fighting in the English army at the battle of Agincourt.\n\n== Notes ==\n* '''a.''' {{Note label|a|a|none}}Pronunciation: The story of the battle has been retold many times in English, from the fifteenth-century [[Agincourt Carol|Agincourt song]] onwards, and an English pronunciation of {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|\u00e6|d\u0292|\u1d7b|n|k|\u0254\u02d0r|t}} has become established.

The Bronze Age is the second principal period of the [[three-age system|three-age Stone-Bronze-Iron system]], as proposed in modern times by [[Christian J\u00fcrgensen Thomsen]], for classifying and studying ancient societies.\n\nAn ancient civilization is defined to be in the Bronze Age either by producing [[bronze]] by [[smelting]] its own [[copper]] and alloying with [[tin]], [[arsenic]], or other metals, or by trading for bronze from production areas elsewhere. Bronze itself is harder and more durable than other metals available at the time, allowing Bronze Age civilizations to gain a technological advantage.\n\nCopper-tin ores are rare, as reflected in the fact that there were no tin bronzes in [[Western Asia]] before trading in bronze began in the [[3rd millennium BC]]. Worldwide, the Bronze Age generally followed the [[Neolithic]] period, with the [[Chalcolithic]] serving as a transition. Although the [[Iron Age]] generally followed the Bronze Age, in some areas (such as [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]), the Iron Age intruded directly on the Neolithic.<ref>[http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=3432&URL_DO=DO_PRINTPAGE&URL_SECTION=201.html Iron In Africa: Revising The History : Unesco].

According to archaeological evidence, cultures in [[Mesopotamia]] ([[cuneiform script]]) and [[Egypt]] ([[hieroglyph]]s) developed the earliest viable writing systems.\n{{toc limit|4}}\n\n== History ==\nThe overall period is characterized by widespread use of bronze, though the place and time of the introduction and development of bronze technology were not universally synchronous.<ref>Bronze was independently discovered in the [[Maykop culture]] of the [[North Caucasus]] as early as the mid-[[4th millennium BC]], which makes them the producers of the oldest known bronze. However, the Maykop culture only had [[arsenical bronze]]. Other regions developed bronze and its associated technology at different periods.</ref> Human-made tin bronze technology requires set production techniques. Tin must be mined (mainly as the tin ore [[cassiterite]]) and smelted separately, then added to molten copper to make bronze alloy. The Bronze Age was a time of extensive use of metals and of developing trade networks (See ''[[Tin sources and trade in ancient times]]''). A 2013 report suggests that the earliest tin-alloy bronze dates to the mid-5th millennium BC in a [[Vin\u010da culture]] site in [[Plo\u010dnik (archaeological site)|Plo\u010dnik]] ([[Serbia]]), although this culture is not conventionally considered part of the Bronze Age.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Radivojevic | first1 = M | last2 = Rehren | first2 = T | last3 = Kuzmanovic-Cvetkovic | first3 = J | last4 = Jovanovic | first4 = M | last5 = Northover | first5 = JP | year = 2013 | title = Tainted ores and the rise of tin bronzes in Eurasia, {{circa}}6500 years ago | url = http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1420706/ | journal = Antiquity | volume = 87 | issue = 338| pages = 1030\u20131045 | doi = 10.1017/S0003598X0004984X }}</ref> The dating of the foil has been disputed.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Sljivar | first1 = D. | last2 = Boric | first2 = D. | display-authors = 2 | last3 = et al. | year = 2014 | title = Context is everything: comments on Radivojevic et al.

In the 14th century BC, the Hittite Kingdom was at its height, encompassing central Anatolia, southwestern [[Syria]] as far as [[Ugarit]], and upper [[Mesopotamia]]. After 1180 BC, amid general turmoil in the [[Levant]] conjectured to have been associated with the sudden arrival of the [[Sea Peoples]],<ref name=AK2013>{{citation|title=The Philistines and Other \"Sea Peoples\" in Text and Archaeology |work=Society of Biblical Literature Archaeology and biblical studies |volume=15 |first=Ann E. |last=Killebrew |publisher=Society of Biblical Lit |date=2013 |isbn=978-1-58983-721-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gBCl2IQfNioC&pg=PA1 |page=2 |accessdate=2015-06-20 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150903212143/https://books.google.com/books?id=gBCl2IQfNioC&pg=PA1 |archivedate=2015-09-03 |deadurl=yes |df= }}. Quote: \"First coined in 1881 by the French Egyptologist G. Maspero (1896), the somewhat misleading term \"Sea Peoples\" encompasses the ethnonyms Lukka, Sherden, Shekelesh, Teresh, Eqwesh, Denyen, Sikil / Tjekker, Weshesh, and Peleset (Philistines). [Footnote: The modern term \"Sea Peoples\" refers to peoples that appear in several New Kingdom Egyptian texts as originating from \"islands\" (tables 1\u20132; Adams and Cohen, this volume; see, e.g., [[Robert Drews|Drews]] 1993, 57 for a summary). The use of quotation marks in association with the term \"Sea Peoples\" in our title is intended to draw attention to the problematic nature of this commonly used term. It is noteworthy that the designation \"of the sea\" appears only in relation to the Sherden, Shekelesh, and Eqwesh. Subsequently, this term was applied somewhat indiscriminately to several additional ethnonyms, including the Philistines, who are portrayed in their earliest appearance as invaders from the north during the reigns of Merenptah and Ramesses Ill (see, e.g., Sandars 1978; Redford 1992, 243, n. 14; for a recent review of the primary and secondary literature, see Woudhuizen 2006). Hencefore the term Sea Peoples will appear without quotation marks.]\"</ref><ref name=Drews48>[https://books.google.com/books?id=bFpK6aXEWN8C&pg=PA48&lpg=PA48 The End of the Bronze Age: Changes in Warfare and the Catastrophe Ca. 1200 B.C., Robert Drews, p48\u201361] Quote: \"The thesis that a great \"migration of the Sea Peoples\" occurred ca. 1200 B.C. is supposedly based on Egyptian inscriptions, one from the reign of Merneptah and another from the reign of Ramesses III. Yet in the inscriptions themselves such a migration nowhere appears. After reviewing what the Egyptian texts have to say about 'the sea peoples', one Egyptologist (Wolfgang Helck) recently remarked that although some things are unclear, \"eins ist aber sicher: Nach den agyptischen Texten haben wir es nicht mit einer 'Volkerwanderung' zu tun.\" Thus the migration hypothesis is based not on the inscriptions themselves but on their interpretation.\"</ref> the kingdom disintegrated into several independent \"Neo-Hittite\" city-states, some of which survived until as late as the 8th century BC.\n\n[[Arzawa]] in Western Anatolia during the second half of the [[second millennium BC]] likely extended along southern Anatolia in a belt that reaches from near the [[Turkish Lakes Region]] to the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] coast. [[Arzawa]] was the western neighbor\u2014sometimes a rival and sometimes a vassal\u2014of the [[Hittite Kingdom|Middle and New Hittite Kingdoms]].\n\nThe [[Assuwa league]] was a confederation of states in western Anatolia that was defeated by the Hittites under an earlier [[Tudhaliya I]], around 1400 BC. Arzawa has been associated with the much more obscure [[Assuwa]] generally located to its north. It probably bordered it, and may even be an alternative term for it (at least during some periods).\n\n==== Egypt ====\n{{Main|Ancient Egypt}}\n\n===== Early Bronze dynasties =====\n{|align=right\n|-\n! style=\"color:#black; background:#f8eaba; font-size:100%; text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\"|Egyptian Bronze Age\n|-\n|<gallery>\nFile:Caryatid Mirror, about 1540-1296 BC, New Kingdom, Dynasty 18, bronze perhaps with black copper inlay - Cleveland Museum of Art - DSC08779.JPG|Bronze [[mirror]] with a female human figure at the base, [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt]] (1540\u20131296 BC).\nFile:Louvre 042005 06.jpg|Sphinx-lion of [[Thutmose III]] 1479\u20131425 BC\n</gallery>\n|}\n\nIn [[Ancient Egypt]] the Bronze Age begins in the [[Protodynastic Period of Egypt|Protodynastic period]], {{circa|lk=no|3150}} BC.

Page 14.</ref> immediately follows the unification of Lower and Upper Egypt, {{circa|lk=no|3100}} BC. It is generally taken to include the First and Second Dynasties, lasting from the Protodynastic Period of Egypt until about 2686 BC, or the beginning of the Old Kingdom. With the First Dynasty, the capital moved from [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]] to Memphis with a unified Egypt ruled by an Egyptian god-king. Abydos remained the major holy land in the south. The hallmarks of ancient Egyptian civilization, such as art, architecture and many aspects of religion, took shape during the Early Dynastic period. [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] in the Early Bronze Age was the largest city of the time.\nThe [[Old Kingdom]] of the regional Bronze Age<ref name=\"KSnPG\" /> is the name given to the period in the 3rd millennium BC when Egypt attained its first continuous peak of civilization in complexity and achievement \u2013 the first of three \"Kingdom\" periods, which mark the high points of civilization in the [[Geography of Egypt#Nile Valley and Delta|lower Nile Valley]] (the others being [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] and the [[New Kingdom]]).\n\nThe [[First Intermediate Period of Egypt]],<ref>Hansen, M. H. (2000). A comparative study of thirty city-state cultures: An investigation conducted by the Copenhagen Polis Centre. Copenhagen: Det Kongelike Danske Videnskabernes Selskab. Page 68.</ref> often described as a \"dark period\" in ancient Egyptian history, spanned about 100 years after the end of the Old Kingdom from about 2181 to 2055 BC. Very little monumental evidence survives from this period, especially from the early part of it. The First Intermediate Period was a dynamic time when the rule of Egypt was roughly divided between two competing power bases: [[Herakleopolis Magna|Heracleopolis]] in Lower Egypt and [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] in Upper Egypt. These two kingdoms would eventually come into conflict, with the Theban kings conquering the north, resulting in the reunification of Egypt under a single ruler during the second part of the 11th Dynasty.\n\n===== Middle Bronze dynasties =====\nThe [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt]] lasted from 2055 to 1650 BC. During this period, the [[Ancient Egyptian religion|Osiris funerary cult]] rose to dominate Egyptian popular religion. The period comprises two phases: the 11th Dynasty, which ruled from Thebes and the 12th<ref>Othmar Keel and Christoph Uehlinger. ''Gods, goddesses, and images of God in ancient Israel'', 1998. Page 17 (cf. \"The first phase (Middle Bronze Age IIA) runs roughly parallel to the Egyptian Twelfth Dynasty\")</ref> and 13th Dynasties centered on [[el-Lisht]]. The unified kingdom was previously considered to comprise the 11th and 12th Dynasties, but historians now at least partially consider the 13th Dynasty to belong to the Middle Kingdom.\n\nDuring the [[Second Intermediate Period]],<ref>Bruce G. Trigger. ''Ancient Egypt: a social history''. 1983. Page 137. (cf.&nbsp;... \"for the Middle Kingdom and Second Intermediate Period it is the Middle Bronze Age\".)</ref> Ancient Egypt fell into disarray for a second time, between the end of the Middle Kingdom and the start of the New Kingdom. It is best known for the [[Hyksos]], whose reign comprised the 15th and 16th dynasties. The Hyksos first appeared in Egypt during the 11th Dynasty, began their climb to power in the 13th Dynasty, and emerged from the Second Intermediate Period in control of [[Avaris]] and the [[Nile Delta|Delta]]. By the 15th Dynasty, they ruled lower Egypt, and they were expelled at the end of the 17th Dynasty.\n\n===== Late Bronze dynasties =====\nThe [[New Kingdom of Egypt]], also referred to as the Egyptian Empire, lasted from the 16th to the 11th century BC. The New Kingdom followed the Second Intermediate Period and was succeeded by the [[Third Intermediate Period]]. It was Egypt's most prosperous time and marked the peak of Egypt's power. The later New Kingdom, i.e. the 19th and 20th Dynasties (1292\u20131069 BC), is also known as the [[Ramesside period]], after the eleven pharaohs that took the name of Ramesses.\n\n==== Iranian Plateau ====\n{|align=right\n|-\n! style=\"color:#black; background:#f8eaba; font-size:100%; text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\"|Persian Bronze Age\n|-\n|<gallery>\nFile:Elam cool.jpg|Late 3rd Millennium BC silver cup from Marvdasht, [[Fars Province|Fars]], with linear-Elamite inscription.\n</gallery>\n|}\n{{Further|Iranian Plateau}}\n[[Elam]] was a ''pre-Iranic'' ancient civilization located to the east of Mesopotamia. In the Old Elamite period (Middle Bronze Age), Elam consisted of kingdoms on the [[Iranian Plateau]], centered in [[Anshan (Persia)|Anshan]], and from the mid-2nd millennium BC, it was centered in [[Susa]] in the [[Khuzestan]] lowlands. Its culture played a crucial role in the [[Gutian people|Gutian Empire]] and especially during the [[Iranic]] [[Achaemenid dynasty]] that succeeded it.\n\nThe [[Bactria\u2013Margiana Archaeological Complex|Oxus civilization]]<ref>[[Ormonde Maddock Dalton|Dalton, O.

In the Early Bronze Age the culture of the [[Kopet Dag]] oases and [[Altyndepe]] developed a proto-urban society. This corresponds to level IV at [[Namazga-Tepe]]. Altyndepe was a major centre even then. Pottery was wheel-turned. Grapes were grown.

The term Neo-Syria is used to designate the early [[Iron Age]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8qvY8pxVxcwC&pg=PA57|title= A Comparative Study of Thirty City-state Cultures: An Investigation, Volume 21|author= Mogens Herman Hansen| page=57|year= 2000|accessdate=2015-06-05|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150620001516/https://books.google.com/books?id=8qvY8pxVxcwC&pg=PA57|archivedate=2015-06-20}}</ref>\n\nThe old Syrian period was dominated by the [[Ebla#First kingdom|Eblaite first kingdom]], [[Tell Brak#Kingdom of Nagar|Nagar]] and the [[The second kingdom of Mari|Mariote second kingdom]]. The Akkadian conquered large areas of the Levant and were followed by the [[Amorites|Amorite kingdoms]], {{circa|lk=no|2000}}\u20131600 BC, which arose in [[Mari, Syria#The Lim dynasty|Mari]], [[Yamhad]], [[Qatna]], [[Assyria]].<ref>under [[Shamshi-Adad I]]</ref> From the 15th century BC onward, the term [[Amurru kingdom|Amurru]] is usually applied to the region extending north of Canaan as far as [[Kadesh (Syria)|Kadesh]] on the [[Orontes River]].\n\nThe earliest known [[Ugarit]] contact with Egypt (and the first exact dating of Ugaritic civilization) comes from a [[carnelian]] bead identified with the Middle Kingdom pharaoh Senusret I, 1971\u20131926 BC. A [[stela]] and a statuette from the Egyptian pharaohs Senusret III and Amenemhet III have also been found. However, it is unclear at what time these monuments got to Ugarit. In the [[Amarna letters]], messages from Ugarit {{circa|lk=no|1350}} BC written by Ammittamru I, Niqmaddu II, and his queen, were discovered. From the 16th to the 13th century BC, Ugarit remained in constant touch with Egypt and Cyprus (named Alashiya).\n\nThe [[Mitanni]] was a loosely organized state in northern Syria and south-east Anatolia from {{circa|lk=no|1500}}\u20131300 BC. Founded by an Indo-Aryan ruling class that governed a predominantly Hurrian population, Mitanni came to be a regional power after the Hittite destruction of Kassite Babylon created a power vacuum in Mesopotamia. At its beginning, Mitanni's major rival was Egypt under the Thutmosids. However, with the ascent of the Hittite empire, Mitanni and Egypt made an alliance to protect their mutual interests from the threat of Hittite domination. At the height of its power, during the 14th century BC, it had outposts centered on its capital, [[Washukanni]], which archaeologists have located on the headwaters of the Khabur River. Eventually, Mitanni succumbed to Hittite, and later Assyrian attacks, and was reduced to a province of the Middle Assyrian Empire.\n\nThe [[Israelites]] were an [[ancient Semitic-speaking peoples|ancient Semitic-speaking people]] of the [[Ancient Near East]] who inhabited part of [[Canaan]] during the [[history of ancient Israel and Judah|tribal and monarchic periods]] (15th to 6th centuries BC),<ref>Finkelstein, Israel. \"Ethnicity and origin of the Iron I settlers in the Highlands of Canaan: Can the real Israel stand up?.\" The Biblical archaeologist 59.4 (1996): 198\u2013212.</ref><ref>Finkelstein, Israel.

The name \"Israel\" first appears {{circa|lk=no|1209}} BC, at the end of the [[Late Bronze Age]] and the very beginning of the [[Iron Age]], on the [[Merneptah Stele]] raised by the Egyptian pharaoh [[Merneptah]].\n\nThe [[Arameans]] were a Northwest Semitic semi-nomadic and pastoralist people who originated in what is now modern Syria (Biblical Aram) during the Late Bronze Age and the early Iron Age. Large groups migrated to Mesopotamia, where they intermingled with the native Akkadian (Assyrian and Babylonian) population. The Aramaeans never had a unified empire; they were divided into independent kingdoms all across the Near East. After the Bronze Age collapse, their political influence was confined to a number of Syro-Hittite states, which were entirely absorbed into the Neo-Assyrian Empire by the 8th century BC.\n\n==== Mesopotamia ====\n{{Main|History of Mesopotamia|l1=Ancient Mesopotamia}}\nIn [[Mesopotamia]], the [[Bronze Age Mesopotamia|Mesopotamian Bronze Age]] began about 3500 BC and ended with the [[Kassites|Kassite]] period ({{circa|lk=no|1500}} BC \u2013 {{circa|lk=no|1155}} BC). The usual tripartite division into an Early, Middle and Late Bronze Age is not used. Instead, a division primarily based on art-historical and historical characteristics is more common.\n\nThe [[cities of the Ancient Near East]] housed several tens of thousands of people. [[Ur]], [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]], [[Isin]], [[Larsa]] and [[Nippur]] in the Middle Bronze Age and [[Babylon]], [[Calah]] and [[Assur]] in the Late Bronze Age similarly had large populations. The [[Akkadian Empire]] (2335\u20132154 BC) became the dominant power in the region, and after its fall the Sumerians enjoyed a renaissance with the [[Neo-Sumerian Empire]]. [[Assyria]] was extant from as early as the 25th century BC, and became a regional power with the [[Old Assyrian Empire]] ({{circa|lk=no|2025}}\u20131750 BC). The earliest mention of [[Babylon]] (then a small administrative town) appears on a tablet from the reign of [[Sargon of Akkad]] in the 23rd century BC. The [[Amorite]] dynasty established the [[city-state]] of Babylon in the 19th century BC. Over 100 years later, it briefly took over the other city-states and formed the short lived First [[Babylonia]]n Empire during what is also called the [[First Babylonian Dynasty|Old Babylonian Period]]. Akkad, Assyria and Babylonia all used the written [[East Semitic languages|East Semitic]] [[Akkadian language]] for official use and as a spoken language. By that time, the Sumerian language was no longer spoken, but was still in religious use in Assyria and Babylonia, and would remain so until the 1st century AD. The [[Akkadian]] and [[Sumer]]ian traditions played a major role in later Assyrian and Babylonian culture, even though Babylonia (unlike the more militarily powerful Assyria) itself was founded by non-native [[Amorites]] and often ruled by other non-indigenous peoples, such as [[Kassites]], [[Arameans]] and [[Chaldea]]ns, as well as its Assyrian neighbours.\n\n===Asia===\n==== Central Asia ====\n===== Seima-Turbino Phenomenon =====\n{{Main|Seima-Turbino Phenomenon}}\nThe [[Altai Mountains]] in what is now southern [[Russia]] and central [[Mongolia]] have been identified as the point of origin of a cultural enigma termed the [[Seima-Turbino Phenomenon]].<ref name=BBCKeys>{{cite journal\n  | last = Keys\n  | first = David\n  | author-link = David Keys (author)\n  | author2-link =\n  | title = Scholars crack the code of an ancient enigma\n  | journal = [[BBC History (magazine)|BBC History Magazine]]\n  | volume = 10\n  | issue = 1\n  | page = 9\n  | date = January 2009\n  | url =\n  | doi =\n  | id = }}</ref> It is conjectured that changes in climate in this region around 2000 BC and the ensuing ecological, economic and political changes triggered a rapid and massive migration westward into northeast Europe, eastward into China and southward into [[Vietnam]] and [[Thailand]]\n<ref name=White>{{cite journal|last1=White|first1=Joyce|last2=Hamilton|first2=Elizabeth|title=The Transmission of Early Bronze Technology to Thailand: New Perspectives|journal=Journal of World Prehistory|date=2009|volume=22|issue=4|pages=357\u2013397|doi=10.1007/s10963-009-9029-z}}</ref> across a frontier of some 4,000 miles.<ref name=BBCKeys /> This migration took place in just five to six generations and led to peoples from Finland in the west to Thailand in the east employing the same metal working technology and, in some areas, horse breeding and riding.<ref name=BBCKeys /> It is further conjectured that the same migrations spread the [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] group of languages across Europe and Asia: some 39 languages of this group are still extant, including [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Estonian language|Estonian]].<ref name=BBCKeys />\nHowever, recent genetic testings of sites in south Siberia and [[Kazakhstan]] ([[Andronovo]] horizon) would rather support a spreading of the bronze technology via [[Indo-European migrations]] eastwards, as this technology was well known for quite a while in western regions.<ref>{{Cite journal |pmc = 1691686|year = 2004|last1 = Lalueza-Fox|first1 = C.|title = Unravelling migrations in the steppe: Mitochondrial DNA sequences from ancient central Asians|journal = Proceedings.

Examples are the numerous large sacrificial tripods known as [[Ding (vessel)|dings]] in Chinese; there are many other distinct shapes. Surviving identified Chinese ritual bronzes tend to be highly decorated, often with the ''[[taotie]]'' motif, which involves highly stylized animal faces. These appear in three main motif types: those of demons, of symbolic animals, and of abstract symbols.<ref>Erdberg, E.: \"Ancient Chinese Bronzes\", p. 20. Siebenbad-Verlag, 1993.</ref> Many large bronzes also bear [[Chinese bronze inscriptions|cast inscriptions]] that are the great bulk of the surviving body of early [[Chinese writing]] and have helped historians and archaeologists piece together the history of China, especially during the Zhou dynasty (1046\u2013256 BC).\n\nThe bronzes of the Western Zhou dynasty document large portions of history not found in the extant texts that were often composed by persons of varying rank and possibly even social class.

It is also known that in this era the [[breadbasket]] of the Minoan empire, the area north of the [[Black Sea]], also suddenly lost much of its population, and thus probably some capacity to cultivate crops.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}Drought and famine in Anatolia may have also led to the Aegean Collapse by disrupting trade networks, and therefore preventing the Aegean from accessing bronze and luxury goods.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Greek Art and Archaeology|last=Neer|first=Richard T.|publisher=Thames and Hudson Inc.|year=2012|isbn=978-0-500-28877-1|location=New York, New York, USA|page=63}}</ref>\n\nThe Aegean Collapse has been attributed to the exhaustion of the [[Cyprus|Cypriot]] forests causing the end of the bronze trade.<ref>Cities on the Sea., Swiny, S., Hohlfelder, R.

Page 96.</ref> The colonies of the Minoan empire then suffered drought, famine, war, or some combination of those three, and had no access to the distant resources of an empire by which they could easily recover.\n\nThe [[Thera eruption]] occurred around the Aegean Collapse, {{convert|110|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of Crete. Speculation include a [[tsunami]] from Thera (more commonly known today as Santorini) destroyed Cretan cities. A tsunami may have destroyed the Cretan [[navy]] in its home harbour, which then lost crucial naval battles; so that in the [[Minoan chronology|LMIB/LMII]] event ({{circa|lk=no|1450}} BC) the cities of [[Crete]] burned and the [[Mycenaean civilization]] took over [[Knossos]]. If the eruption occurred in the late 17th century BC (as most chronologists now think) then its immediate effects belong to the Middle to Late Bronze Age transition, and not to the end of the Late Bronze Age; but it could have triggered the instability that led to the collapse first of Knossos and then of Bronze Age society overall. One such theory highlights the role of Cretan expertise in administering the empire, post-Thera. If this expertise was concentrated in Crete, then the Mycenaeans may have made political and commercial mistakes in administering the Cretan empire.\n\nArchaeological findings, including some on the island of Thera, suggest that the centre of Minoan Civilization at the time of the eruption was actually on Thera rather than on Crete.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} According to this theory, the catastrophic loss of the political, administrative and economic centre by the eruption as well as the damage wrought by the tsunami to the coastal towns and villages of Crete precipitated the decline of the Minoans. A weakened political entity with a reduced economic and military capability and fabled riches would have then been more vulnerable to human predators. Indeed, the Santorini Eruption is usually dated to  {{circa|lk=no|1630}} BC, while the Mycenaean Greeks first enter the historical record a few decades later, {{circa|lk=no|1600}} BC. Thus, the later Mycenaean assaults on Crete ({{circa|lk=no|1450}} BC) and Troy ( {{circa|lk=no|1250}}BC) are revealed as mere continuations of the steady encroachments of the Greeks upon the weakened Minoan world.\n\n==== Central Europe ====\n{{See also|Bronze Age in Southeastern Europe|Bronze Age in Romania}}\n{|align=right\n|-\n! style=\"color:#black; background:#f8eaba; font-size:100%; text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\"|Central European Bronze Age\n|-\n|<gallery perrow=\"2\">\nFile:Prehistoric Times of Bohemia, Moravia and Slovakia - NM Prague 18.JPG|[[Jeni\u0161ovice (Chrudim District)|Jeni\u0161ovice]] cup\nFile:Bronze cuirass 2900g Grenoble end of 7th early 6th century BCE.jpg|[[Grenoble]] cuirass\nFile:2007 07260179.JPG|Mycenaean sword found in [[Romania]]\nFile:Bronze age weapons Romania.jpg|Bronze Age weaponry and ornaments\n</gallery>\n|}\n\nIn [[Central Europe]], the early Bronze Age [[Unetice culture]] (1800\u20131600 BC) includes numerous smaller groups like the [[Straubingen culture|Straubing]], [[Adlerberg culture|Adlerberg]] and [[Hatvan]] cultures. Some very rich burials, such as the one located at [[Leubingen]] with grave gifts crafted from gold, point to an increase of social stratification already present in the Unetice culture. All in all, cemeteries of this period are rare and of small size. The Unetice culture is followed by the middle Bronze Age (1600\u20131200 BC) [[Tumulus culture]], which is characterised by inhumation burials in [[tumuli]] (barrows). In the eastern [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[K\u00f6r\u00f6s River|K\u00f6r\u00f6s]] tributaries, the early Bronze Age first saw the introduction of the [[Mako culture]], followed by the [[Otomani culture|Otomani]] and [[Gyulavarsand culture]]s.\n\nThe late Bronze Age [[Urnfield]] culture (1300\u2013700 BC) is characterized by cremation burials. It includes the [[Lusatian culture]] in eastern [[Germany]] and [[Poland]] (1300\u2013500 BC) that continues into the [[Iron Age]]. The Central European Bronze Age is followed by the Iron Age [[Hallstatt culture]] (700\u2013450 BC).\n\n[[list of archaeological sites|Important sites]] include:\n* [[Biskupin]] ([[Poland]])\n* [[Nebra (Unstrut)|Nebra]] ([[Germany]])\n* [[Vr\u00e1ble]] ([[Slovakia]])\n* Zug-Sumpf, [[Canton of Zug|Zug]], [[Switzerland]]\n\nThe Bronze Age in Central Europe has been described in the chronological schema of German prehistorian [[Paul Reinecke]]. He described Bronze A1 (Bz A1) period (2300\u20132000 BC : triangular daggers, flat axes, stone wrist-guards, flint arrowheads) and Bronze A2 (Bz A2) period (1950\u20131700 BC : daggers with metal hilt, flanged axes, halberds, pins with perforated spherical heads, solid bracelets) and phases Hallstatt A and B (Ha A and B).\n\n==== South Europe ====\nThe [[Apennine culture]] (also called Italian Bronze Age) is a technology complex of central and southern Italy spanning the [[Chalcolithic]] and Bronze Age proper. The [[Camuni]] were an ancient people of uncertain origin (according to [[Pliny the Elder]], they were [[Euganei]]; according to [[Strabo]], they were [[Rhaetians]]) who lived in [[Val Camonica]] \u2013 in what is now northern [[Lombardy]] \u2013 during the [[Iron Age]], although human groups of hunters, shepherds and farmers are known to have lived in the area since the [[Neolithic]].\n\nLocated in [[Sardinia]] and [[Corsica]], the [[Nuragic civilization]] lasted from the early Bronze Age (18th century BC) to the 2nd century AD, when the islands were already Romanized. They take their name from the characteristic nuragic towers, which evolved from the pre-existing megalithic culture, which built [[dolmen]]s and [[menhir]]s. The nuraghe towers are unanimously considered the best preserved and largest megalithic remains in Europe. Their effective use is still debated: some scholars considered them as monumental tombs, others as [[Giants' grave|Houses of the Giants]], other as fortresses, ovens for metal fusion, prisons or, finally, temples for a solar cult. Around the end of the 3rd millennium BC, Sardinia exported towards Sicily a ''Culture'' that built small dolmens, trilithic or polygonal shaped, that served as tombs as it has been ascertained in the Sicilian dolmen of \u201cCava dei Servi\u201d. From this region they reached Malta island and other countries of Mediterranean basin.<ref>Piccolo, Salvatore, ''op. cit.'', pp. 1 onwards.</ref>\n\nThe [[Terramare]] was an early [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] civilization in the area of what is now [[Pianura Padana]] (northern Italy) before the arrival of the [[Celts]], and in other parts of Europe. They lived in square villages of wooden [[stilt houses]]. These villages were built on land, but generally near a stream, with roads that crossed each other at [[right angles]]. The whole complex denoted the nature of a fortified settlement. Terramare were widespread in the Pianura Padana (specially along the [[Panaro (river)|Panaro]] river, between [[Modena]] and [[Bologna]]) and in the rest of Europe. The civilization developed in the Middle and Late Bronze Age, between the 17th and the 13th centuries BC.\n\nThe [[Castellieri culture]] developed in [[Istria]] during the Middle Bronze Age. It lasted for more than a millennium, from the 15th century BC until the Roman conquest in the 3rd century BC. It takes its name from the fortified boroughs (''Castellieri'', [[Friulian language|Friulian]] ''cjastelir'') that characterized the culture.\n\nThe [[Canegrate culture]] developed from the mid-Bronze Age (13th century BC) until the Iron Age in the [[Pianura Padana]], in what are now western [[Lombardy]], eastern [[Piedmont]] and [[Canton Ticino|Ticino]]. It takes its name from the township of [[Canegrate]] where, in the 20th century, some fifty tombs with ceramics and metal objects were found. The Canegrate culture migrated from the northwest part of the Alps and descended to [[Pianura Padana]] from the Swiss Alps passes and the Ticino.\n\nThe [[Golasecca culture]] developed starting from the late Bronze Age in the [[Po plain]]. It takes its name from Golasecca, a locality next to the [[Ticino]] where, in the early 19th century, abbot Giovanni Battista Giani excavated its first findings (some fifty tombs with ceramics and metal objects). Remains of the Golasecca culture span an area of c. 20,000 square kilometers south to the Alps, between the Po, [[Sesia]] and [[Serio (river)|Serio]] rivers, dating from the 9th to the 4th century BC.\n\n==== West Europe ====\n\n===== Atlantic Bronze Age =====\n{{Main|Atlantic Bronze Age}}\n\n{|align=right\n|-\n! style=\"color:#black; background:#f8eaba; font-size:100%; text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\"|Atlantic Bronze Age\n|-\n|<gallery>\nFile:Sword bronze age (2nd version).jpg|Ceremonial giant dirk (1500\u20131300 BC).\nFile:Casco Leiro.jpg|Golden helmet (Leiro, Galicia)\n</gallery>\n|}\n\nThe [[Atlantic Bronze Age]] is a cultural complex of the period of approximately 1300\u2013700 BC that includes different cultures in Portugal, Andalusia, Galicia and the British Isles. It is marked by economic and cultural exchange. Commercial contacts extend to Denmark and the Mediterranean. The Atlantic Bronze Age was defined by a number of distinct regional centres of metal production, unified by a regular maritime exchange of some of their products.\n\n===== Great Britain =====\n{{Main|Bronze Age Britain}}\nIn [[Great Britain]], the Bronze Age is considered to have been the period from around 2100 to 750 BC. [[Human migration|Migration]] brought new people to the islands from the continent. Recent tooth enamel isotope research on bodies found in early Bronze Age graves around [[Stonehenge]] indicate that at least some of the migrants came from the area of modern [[Switzerland]]. Another example site is Must Farm, near Whittlesey, which has recently been host to the most complete Bronze Age wheel ever to be found. The [[Beaker culture]] displayed different behaviours from the earlier [[Neolithic]] people, and cultural change was significant. Integration is thought to have been peaceful, as many of the early [[henge]] sites were seemingly adopted by the newcomers. The rich [[Wessex culture]] developed in southern Britain at this time. Additionally, the climate was deteriorating; where once the weather was warm and dry it became much wetter as the Bronze Age continued, forcing the population away from easily defended sites in the hills and into the fertile [[valley]]s. Large livestock farms developed in the lowlands and appear to have contributed to economic growth and inspired increasing forest clearances. The [[Deverel-Rimbury culture]] began to emerge in the second half of the Middle Bronze Age ( {{circa|lk=no|1400}}\u20131100 BC) to exploit these conditions. [[Devon]] and [[Cornwall]] were major sources of [[tin]] for much of western Europe and [[copper]] was extracted from sites such as the [[Great Orme]] mine in northern [[Wales]]. Social groups appear to have been tribal but with growing complexity and hierarchies becoming apparent.\n\nThe burial of the dead (which, until this period, had usually been communal) became more individual. For example, whereas in the Neolithic a large [[chambered cairn]] or [[long barrow]] housed the dead, Early Bronze Age people buried their dead in individual [[tumulus|barrows]] (also commonly known and marked on modern British [[Ordnance Survey]] maps as tumuli), or sometimes in [[cist]]s covered with [[cairn]]s.\n\nThe greatest quantities of bronze objects in [[England]] were discovered in [[East Cambridgeshire]], where the most important finds were recovered in [[Isleham]] (more than [[Isleham Hoard|6500 pieces]]).<ref>Hall and Coles, p. 81\u201388.</ref>\nAlloying of copper with zinc or tin to make [[brass]] or [[bronze]] was practised soon after the discovery of copper itself.

The preceding period is known as the [[Copper Age]] and is characterised by the production of [[flat axes]], [[daggers]], [[halberds]] and [[stitching awl|awls]] in copper. The period is divided into three phases: [[Early Bronze Age]] (2000\u20131500 BC), [[Middle Bronze Age]] (1500\u20131200 BC), and [[Late Bronze Age]] (1200\u2013{{circa|lk=no|500}} BC). Ireland is also known for a relatively large number of Early Bronze Age burials.\n\nOne of the characteristic types of artifact of the Early Bronze Age in Ireland is the [https://web.archive.org/web/20130103003030/http://www.metal-detecting.info/bronze-age-flat-axe.html flat axe]. There are five main types of flat axes: [[Lough Ravel]] ({{circa|lk=no|2200}} BC), Ballybeg ({{circa|lk=no|2000}} BC), [[Killaha]] ({{circa|lk=no|2000}} BC), [[Ballyvalley]] ({{circa|lk=no|2000}}\u20131600 BC), [[Derryniggin]] ({{circa|lk=no|1600}} BC), and a number of metal ingots in the shape of axes.<ref>Waddell; Eogan.</ref>\n\n==== North Europe ====\n{{Main|Nordic Bronze Age}}\n{|align=right\n|-\n! style=\"color:#black; background:#f8eaba; font-size:100%; text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\"|Bronze artifacts\n|-\n|<gallery>\nFile:Assorted bronze castings.JPG|Assorted Celtic bronze castings dating from the Bronze Age.\n</gallery>\n|}\n\nThe Bronze Age in Northern Europe spans the entire [[2nd millennium BC]] ([[Unetice culture]], [[Urnfield culture]], [[Tumulus culture]], [[Terramare culture]], [[Lusatian culture]]) lasting until {{circa|lk=no|600}} BC. The [[Nordic Bronze Age|Northern Bronze Age]] was both a period and a Bronze Age culture in Scandinavian pre-history, {{circa|lk=no|1700}}\u2013500 BC, with sites that reached as far east as Estonia. Succeeding the Late Neolithic culture, its ethnic and linguistic affinities are unknown in the absence of written sources. It is followed by the [[Pre-Roman Iron Age]].\n\nEven though Northern European Bronze Age cultures were relatively late, and came into existence via trade, sites present rich and well-preserved objects made of wool, wood and imported Central European bronze and gold. Many rock carvings depict ships, and the large stone burial monuments known as stone ships suggest that shipping played an important role. Thousands of rock carvings depict ships, most probably representing sewn plank built canoes for warfare, fishing and trade. These may have a history as far back as the neolithic period and continue into the Pre-Roman Iron Age, as shown by the [[Hjortspring boat]]. There are many mounds and rock carving sites from the period. Numerous artifacts of bronze and gold are found. No written language existed in the Nordic countries during the Bronze Age. The rock carvings have been dated through comparison with depicted artifacts.\n\n==== Caucasus ====\n[[Arsenical bronze]] artifacts of the [[Maykop culture]] in the [[North Caucasus]] have been dated around the 4th millennium BC.<ref>Philip L. Kohl. The making of bronze age Eurasia.

The name also appears in English as Pit-Grave Culture or Ochre-Grave Culture. The [[Catacomb culture]], {{circa|lk=no|2800}}\u20132200 BC, comprises several related Early Bronze Age cultures occupying what is presently Ukraine. The [[Srubna culture]] was a Late Bronze Age (18th\u201312th centuries BC) culture.

With artifacts of the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] being found in ancient [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], it is clear that these civilizations were not only in touch with each other but also trading with each other. Early long-distance trade was limited almost exclusively to luxury goods like spices, textiles and precious metals. Not only did this make cities with ample amounts of these products extremely rich but also led to an inter-mingling of cultures for the first time in history.<ref name=\"kristiansen\">{{cite journal |last1=Kristiansen |first1=Kristian |title=Connected Histories: the Dynamics of Bronze Age Interaction and Trade 1500-1100 bc |journal=Proceedings of the Prehistoric Society |date=November 26, 2015 |volume=81 |pages=361\u2013392 }}</ref>\n\nTrade routes were not only over land but also over water. The first and most extensive trade routes were over rivers such as the [[Nile]], the [[Tigris]] and the [[Euphrates]] which led to growth of cities on the banks of these rivers. The domestication of camels at a later time also helped encourage the use of trade routes over land, linking the Indus Valley with the Mediterranean. This further led to towns sprouting up in numbers any and everywhere there was a pit-stop or caravan-to-ship port.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Div col}}\n\n* {{Portal-inline|Bronze Age}}\n* [[Human timeline]]\n* [[Life timeline]]\n* [[Middle Bronze Age migrations (Ancient Near East)]]\n* [[Namazga]] V and [[Altyndepe]]\n* [[Oxhide ingot]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n=== Seafaring ===\n* [[Dover Bronze Age Boat]]\u2014the earliest known seagoing plank-built vessel\n* [[Ferriby Boats]]\n* [[Langdon Bay hoard]]\u2014see also [[Dover Museum]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite journal | last1 = Figueiredo | first1 = Elin | year = 2010 | title = Smelting and Recycling Evidences from the Late Bronze Age habitat site of Baioes | url = http://repositorio.ul.pt/bitstream/10451/9795/1/Smelting%20and%20recicling%20evidences%20from%20the%20Late%20Bronze%20Age%20habitat%20site%20of%20Bai%c3%b5es.pdf| journal = Journal of Archaeological Science | volume = 37 | issue = 7| pages = 1623\u20131634 | doi=10.1016/j.jas.2010.01.023| hdl = 10451/9795}}\n* Eogan, George (1983) ''The hoards of the Irish later Bronze Age'', Dublin: University College, 331p., {{ISBN|0-901120-77-4}}\n* Hall, David and Coles, John (1994) ''Fenland survey : an essay in landscape and persistence'', Archaeological report '''1''', London : English Heritage, 170 p., {{ISBN|1-85074-477-7}}\n* Pernicka, E., Eibner, C., \u00d6ztunah, \u00d6., Wagener, G.A.

It was launched as '''BBC News 24''' on 9 November 1997 at 5:30pm as part of the BBC's foray into digital domestic television channels, becoming the first competitor to [[Sky News]], which had been running since 1989.<ref name=\"kcvcng\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20040404035846/http://tvhome.co.uk/bbcnews24/about.phtml About BBC News 24] TV Home</ref> For a time, looped news, sport and weather bulletins were available to view via [[BBC Red Button]].\n\nOn 22 February 2006, the channel was named ''News Channel of the Year'' at the Royal Television Society Television Journalism Awards for the first time in its history.<ref>[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/media/news/a29532/bbc-winners-at-tv-journalism-awards.html BBC winners at TV journalism awards] Dave West; Digital Spy, 23 February 2006</ref> The judges remarked that this was the year that the channel had \"really come into its own.\"<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/newswatch/ukfs/hi/newsid_4740000/newsid_4742600/4742620.stm News 24 wins news channel of the year] Newswatch \u2013 BBC News Online, 23 February 2006</ref>\n\nFrom May 2007, viewers in the UK could watch the channel via the BBC News website. In April 2008, the channel was renamed ''BBC News'' as part of a \u00a3550,000 rebranding of the BBC's news output, complete with a new studio and presentation. Its sister service, BBC World was also renamed ''[[BBC World News]]'' while the national news bulletins became ''BBC News at One'', ''BBC News at Six'' and ''BBC News at Ten''. Across the day the channel averages about twice the audience of Sky News.\n\nThe channel is based at and broadcasts from [[Broadcasting House]] in the [[West End of London]]. In 2017, it was named the [[Royal Television Society|RTS]] ''News Channel of the Year''\n\n== History ==\n\nBBC News 24 was originally available to digital terrestrial, satellite and cable television subscribers. To this day, it and [[BBC Parliament]] remain the only BBC \"digital\" channels which are made available to analogue cable subscribers. This coverage was improved in 1998 with the advent of [[digital television]] in the United Kingdom allowing [[satellite]] and [[digital terrestrial television]] viewers to also view the service. Initially it was difficult to obtain a digital satellite or terrestrial receiver without a subscription to Sky or [[ITV Digital|ONdigital]] respectively, but now the channel forms an important part of the [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] and [[Freesat]] channel packages.\n\nThe BBC had run the international news channel [[BBC World News|BBC World]] for two and a half years prior to the launch of BBC News 24 on 9 November 1997. [[Sky News]] had had a free hand with domestic news for over eight years (since 5 February 1989) and being owned by [[News Corporation]] their papers were used to criticise the BBC for extending its news output.<ref>[http://www.chauy.com/2006/07/the-sky-news-blog-%E2%80%93-a-new-angle-in-the-news/ The Sky News Blog-A New Angle In The News?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207092209/http://www.chauy.com/2006/07/the-sky-news-blog-%E2%80%93-a-new-angle-in-the-news/ |date=7 February 2012 }} Tips 'N' Tutorials</ref>\n\n[[Sky News]] objected to the breaking of its monopoly, complaining about the costs associated with running a channel that only a minority could view from the [[Television licence|licence fee]]. Sky News claimed that a number of British cable operators had been incentivised to carry News 24 (which, as a licence-fee funded channel was made available to such operators for free) in preference to the commercial Sky News. However, in September 1999 the [[European Commission]] ruled against a complaint made by Sky News that the publicly funded channel was unfair and illegal under EU law. The Commission ruled that the [[Television licence|licence fee]] should be considered state aid but that such aid was justified due to the public service remit of the BBC and that it did not exceed actual costs.<ref>[http://www.reckon.co.uk/open/BBC_News_24 BBC News 24 (State aid)] Reckon Regulation & Competition Economics LLP</ref>\n\nThe channel's journalistic output has been overseen by Controller of the channel, [[Kevin Bakhurst]], since 16 December 2005. This was a return to having a dedicated Controller for the channel in the same way as the rest of the BBC's domestic television channels. At launch, Tim Orchard was Controller of News 24 from 1997 until 2000. Editorial decisions were then overseen by Rachel Atwell in her capacity as Deputy Head of television news. Her deputy Mark Popescu became responsible for editorial content in 2004, a role he continued in until the appointment of Bakhurst as Controller in 2005.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4417472.stm BBC to revamp TV news operation] \u2013 BBC News Online, 8 November 2005</ref>\n\nA further announcement by Head of television news [[Peter Horrocks]] came at the same time as Bakhurst's appointment in which he outlined his plan to provide more funding and resources for the channel and shift the corporation's emphasis regarding news away from the traditional BBC One bulletins and across to the rolling news channel. The introduction of simulcasts of the main bulletins on the channel was to allow the news bulletins to pool resources rather than work against each other at key times in the face of competition particularly from Sky News.<ref>[http://www.tvnewsroom.co.uk/newsdesk/news.php?subaction=showfull&id=1131460853&archive=&start_from=&ucat=5& BBC announces changes to Television News] TV Newsroom, 8 November 2005 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080504034036/http://www.tvnewsroom.co.uk/newsdesk/news.php?subaction=showfull&id=1131460853&archive=&start_from=&ucat=5& |date=4 May 2008 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Board of Governors of the BBC|BBC Governors]]' annual report for 2005/2006 reported that average audience figures for fifteen-minute periods had reached 8.6% in multichannel homes, up from 7.8% in 2004/2005.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/review-report-research/bbcannualreport.pdf BBC Governor's Annual Report 2005/2006] Page 47 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070124022001/http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/review-report-research/bbcannualreport.pdf |date=24 January 2007 }}</ref> The 2004 report claimed that the channel outperformed Sky News in both weekly and monthly reach in multichannel homes for the January 2004 period, and for the first time in two years moved ahead of Sky News in being perceived as the channel best for news.<ref>[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/media/news/a15400/bbc-news-24-edging-ahead-of-sky-news.html BBC News 24 edging ahead of Sky News] Neil Wilkes; Digital Spy, 19 August 2004</ref>\n\n=== 2008 rebranding ===\nOn 21 April 2008, BBC News 24 was renamed ''BBC News'' on the channel itself \u2013 but is referred to as the ''BBC News Channel'' on other BBC services.<ref>[http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/media/article3735982.ece BBC News 24 to be renamed] Times Online</ref> This is part of the creative futures plan, launched in 2006, to bring all BBC News output under the single brand name.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/jun/12/digitalmedia.marketingandpr Creative Futures Plan] ''The Guardian''</ref>\n\nThe BBC News Channel moved from the Studio N8 set, which became home to BBC World News, to what was the home of the national news in Studio N6, allowing the channel to share its set with the ''[[BBC News at One]]'' and the ''[[BBC News at Ten]]'' \u2013 with other bulletins moving to Studio TC7.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305172908/http://bbcnewstvchannel.blogspot.in/2015/08/bbc-news-news-24-wins-news-channel-of.html|title=BBC NEWS - News 24 wins news channel of year|date=5 March 2016|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n=== Move to Broadcasting House ===\nThe channel relocated, along with the remaining BBC News services at Television Centre, to the newly refurbished Broadcasting House on 18 March 2013 at 13:00 GMT.

Since 5 Live's move to Manchester, this has been reversed.  For foreign news, first a \"generic minute\" is recorded, then reports are to [[BBC World Service|World Service]] radio, then the reporter talks to any other programmes that are on air.\n\nA key claim made by Lord Lambert in his report had been that the channel was slower to react to breaking news compared with its main rival Sky News.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20040404035846/http://tvhome.co.uk/bbcnews24/about.phtml Getting creative breakthrough...-About BBC News] TV Home</ref> To counteract this, a new feature introduced with the 2003 relaunch was a 'breaking news sting': a globe shown briefly onscreen to direct a viewer's attention to the breaking news.\n\nThe graphics relaunch in January 2007 has since seen the globe sting replaced by a red strapline to highlight the breaking story immediately.\n\nTo complement this, a permanent live news ticker had earlier been introduced in 2006: this had previously been in use only sporadically. News statements are shown as continuously scrolling upper-case text located at the bottom of the screen; some past ambiguities noted have included spelling the plural of MPs as \"MPS\", together with other occasional spelling and grammatical errors. The design of this ticker was slightly altered with the 2007 graphics redesign and from June turned red to indicate breaking news, as ''[[Newswatch (BBC)|Newswatch]]'' reported viewers' confusion. The ticker is removed during trails and weather forecasts.\n\n==== Overnight and BBC World News simulcasts ====\nThe BBC began [[simulcast]]ing the channel overnight on [[Terrestrial television|terrestrial]] channel BBC One with the launch of the channel, ending the tradition of a closedown but at the same time effectively making the service available to many more viewers. In the early 2000s, BBC Two also started simulcasting the channel, although the weekend morning show ''Weekend 24'' had been simulcast on the channel in the early days. During major breaking news events, the BBC News Channel has been broadcast on BBC One; examples of special broadcasts include the [[September 11 attacks|11 September 2001 attacks]], [[7 July 2005 London bombings]], [[Operation Red Dawn|the capture of Saddam Hussein]], and the [[death of Osama bin Laden]].<ref>[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/media/news/a23123/news-24-claims-july-victory.html News 24 claims July victory] Neil Wilkes; Digital Spy, 1 August 2005</ref><ref>[http://www.tvnewsroom.co.uk/newsdesk/news.php?subaction=showfull&id=1124647138&archive=&start_from=&ucat=5& News 24 top for rolling news] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926232800/http://www.tvnewsroom.co.uk/newsdesk/news.php?subaction=showfull&id=1124647138&archive=&start_from=&ucat=5& |date=26 September 2007 }} TV Newsroom, 21 August 2005</ref> \n\nCoverage of major events has also been simulcast on BBC World News. Currently, overnight viewers receive 25-minute editions of BBC News every hour, and on weekdays 00:00\u201302:00 receive ''[[Newsday (programme)|Newsday]]'', live from Singapore and from London which also includes Asia Business Report and Sport Today between 00:30 and 01:00 and also between 01:30 and 02:00\nFrom 02:00\u201305:00 (00:00\u201306:00 on weekends) receive ''[[BBC World News (programme)|BBC World News]]''. ''The Briefing'' airs between 05:00-06:00 on weekdays.\n\n==== BBC One and BBC Two daytime simulcasts ====\n''[[BBC Breakfast]]'' has been simulcast since launch (in 2000) on [[BBC One]] and BBC News, replacing the individual breakfast shows that had run on both channels. Since May 2006, the simulcast runs from 06:00 until 08:30. ''Breakfast'' on BBC One then continues from [[MediaCityUK]] until 09:15 with entertainment and features, whilst [[BBC News]] goes to [[BBC Business Live]] until 09:00 and reverts to its traditional format from 09:00.\n\nThe ''[[BBC News at Ten]]'' began simulcasting on the channel on 30 January 2006 as part of the ''Ten O'Clock Newshour'', followed by extended sport and business news updates. The bulletin was joined in being simulcast on 10 April 2006 when the ''[[BBC News at One]]'' (with [[British Sign Language]] in-vision signing) and ''[[BBC News at Six]]'' bulletins were added to the schedule following a similar format to the ''News at Ten'' in terms of content on the channel once each simulcast ends.\n\nDuring the summer, the hour-long programme ''News 24 Sunday'' was broadcast both on BBC One and the BBC News Channel at 09:00, to replace ''[[The Andrew Marr Show]]'', which is off air. It was presented by a news presenter, and came from the main News channel studio. The programme was made up mostly of interviews focusing on current affairs, and included a full paper review, a weather summary, and a news update at 09:00, 09:30 and 10:00. ''[[Sunday Morning Live (BBC)|Sunday Morning Live]]'' and alternate programming now fill this slot.\n\nFrom 2013, a new programme was created for [[BBC Two]] for 11 am \u2013 12 pm weekdays, consisting of 30 minutes domestic and 30 minutes of BBC World News.  On Wednesdays, when parliament is sitting the latter is replaced by the [[Daily Politics]] for coverage of [[Prime Ministers Questions]]. In March 2016 the channel started showing Newsnight at 23:15.\n\n==== Exclusive programmes ====\n* ''The Briefing'' - [[Sally Bundock]] with news, business, and sports from BBC News.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b09dccgc|title=The Briefing - BBC News|website=BBC|access-date=8 January 2018}}</ref>\n* ''[[Beyond 100 Days]]'' - The latest news from both sides of the Atlantic, presented by [[Katty Kay]] from Washington and [[Christian Fraser]] from London (Monday to Thursday)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b09575tt|title=Beyond 100 Days - BBC News|website=BBC}}</ref>\n* ''[[BBC World News (TV series)|BBC World News]]'' \u2013 The latest international news as they break from the BBC.\n* ''BBC News'' \u2013 The latest national and international news as they break from the BBC.\n* ''[[Newsday (programme)|Newsday]]'' \u2013 Live international news from London and Singapore every weekday.

This included axing some bulletins and replacing them with ''[[Victoria Derbyshire (TV programme)|Victoria Derbyshire]]'' and ''[[BBC Business Live]]'' with Sally Bundock and Ben Thompson in the morning. ''[[Outside Source]] with [[Ros Atkins]]'' \u2013 an \"interactive\" show already broadcast on BBC World News \u2013 aired Mondays-Thursday at (During major stories 18:00) and 21:00 and a new edition of ''[[World News Today]]'' Friday-Sunday at 21:00 (During major stories 19:00/20:00 Monday-Friday) adding to the 19:00 edition on [[BBC Four]]. ''[[HARDtalk]]'' was moved to 20:30 in May. The 00:00 edition was replaced on Sundays-Thursday with ''[[Newsday (programme)|Newsday]]'' and on Friday-Saturday a standard edition of ''[[BBC World News]]''.\n\n==== BBC World News shared programming ====\nBetween 00:00-06:00 (weekdays) UK time, the channel simulcasts with its sister channel, BBC World News, for the first 25 minutes of each hour with world news shown all through the simulcasts.\n\nOn 1 October 2007, BBC World News started broadcasting ''[[BBC World News America]]'' and ''[[World News Today]]'' at 00:00 and 03:00 GMT respectively. ''World News Today'' was simulcast on the BBC News channel at 03:00 GMT. ''BBC World News America'' used to be aired as a reduced length, [[Time shifting|time-delayed]] version at 00:30 GMT, with ''[[ABC World News Tonight]] with [[David Muir]]'' also being shown at 01:30 every Tuesday-Friday.\n\nFrom 13 June 2011, the weekday editions of [[BBC News]] at 01:00, 02:00, 03:00 and 04:00 were replaced with ''[[Newsday (programme)|Newsday]]''. The programme acts as a morning news bulletin for the [[Asia-Pacific]] region and is broadcast as a double-headed news bulletin with [[Rico Hizon]] in [[Singapore]] and [[Babita Sharma]] in London. ''Asia Business Report'' and ''[[Sport Today]]'' are aired at the back of the first three hours of ''Newsday''. But Newsday changed to 23:00\u201302:00 on BBC News a year later meaning [[Mike Embley]] presents Tuesday-Friday ''BBC World News'' 23:00\u201302:00 with [[Kasia Madera]] on Saturdays and Daniela Ritorto 00:00\u201306:00 Sunday, 02:00\u201305:00 Friday/Monday. \n\n''BBC World News'' and ''World Business Report'' air at 05:00. This was previously known as ''The World Today'', However, since November 2017 this has been rebranded as ''The Briefing'' and ''Business Briefing'' on both channels and in lieu of commercials seen on the international broadcasts, the presenters give a brief update on UK news for domestic audiences.{{cn|date=April 2018}}\n\nIn June 2015, BBC News began simulcasting ''Outside Source with Ros Atkins'' on Mondays-Thursday at (During major stories 18:00) / at 21:00 and a new edition of ''World News Today'' Friday-Sunday at (during major stories Monday-Friday 19:00) 21:00. Since January 2017, they began simulcasting ''Beyond 100 Days'' (previously '100 Days'' and ''100 Days +) Monday to Thursday at 19:00, presented from London and Washington. During August, ''Beyond 100 Days'' is replaced by another edition of  ''World News Today''.\n\nTraditionally, during simulcasts in December, care has been taken to conceal the newsroom Christmas tree for international audiences. From 2015, the 21:00 bulletin has always been an edition of ''World News Today'', replacing ''Outside Source with Ros Atkins''.\n\n=== Sports ===\nSince 5 March 2012, sports bulletins come from the ''BBC Sport Centre'' in [[MediaCityUK]] in [[Salford Quays]], where the sports network [[BBC Radio 5 Live]] is also based.\n\nHeadlines are usually provided at 15 minutes past the hour with a full bulletin after the bottom-of-the-hour headlines. There are also extended sports bulletins per day, entitled ''Sportsday'' or ''Sport Today'' (when simulcasting with BBC World News) broadcast at 00:45, 01:45, 02:45, 03:45, 13:30, 18:30, 19:30 (weekends only), 22:30 (weekdays only). Each bulletin is read by a single sports presenter, with the exception of Saturday ''Sportsday'', which is double headed.\n\nThe channel's sports bulletins (internally known as Sport 24) have always had a separate, dedicated production gallery, which is also responsible for the graphics.\n\nBulletins during [[BBC Breakfast]] are presented by [[Sally Nugent]] or [[Mike Bushell]], with the latter also appearing on other sports bulletins on the channel. As of March 2012 the main sports presenters on the channel are Olly Foster, Katie Gornall, [[Katherine Downes]], [[Damian Johnson (broadcaster)|Damian Johnson]], Andrew Lindsay and Jenny Culshaw.\n\nUntil March 2012 bulletins came from the News Channel studio at the quarter to the hour. Presenters for bulletins on the channel have included: Reshmin Choudhury, [[Amanda Davies]], [[Sean Fletcher]], Olly Foster, Matt Gooderick, [[Lizzie Greenwood-Hughes]], [[Celina Hinchcliffe]], [[Rachael Hodges]], [[Damian Johnson (broadcaster)|Damian Johnson]], [[Adnan Nawaz]] and Olympic gold medallist turned journalist [[Matthew Pinsent]].\n\n=== Business ===\nBefore BBC News moved to Broadcasting House, an hourly business update was included during the weekday schedule from the BBC Business Unit. There were two shifts, from 08:30\u201314:00 and 14:00\u201323:00, presented by Penny Haslam, [[Maryam Moshiri]], Ben Thompson, [[Adam Parsons]], [[Susannah Streeter]], [[Joe Lynam]], Sara Coburn or Sally Eden. News Channel updates were usually broadcast at 40 minutes past the hour between 08:00 and 23:00. The 21:40 round-up was often earlier and the 22:40 bulletin is an extended round-up of the day's business news. Until May 2009, the business updates on the BBC News Channel were broadcast from one of the [[London Stock Exchange]]'s studios in central London. From then until March 2013 the bulletins were provided from the channel's studio at [[BBC Television Centre]]. The business updates were axed in March 2013 as part of the BBC's Delivering Quality First plan. But after complaints returned in November 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/aboutthebbc/reports/pdf/dqf_newsandenglishregions.pdf |title=Delivering Quality First|work=BBC|accessdate=19 March 2013}}</ref> \n\nStock market updates now only appear during the quarter-to-the-hour headlines. Rachel Horne is the main presenter from 13:30\u201318:00 with Vishala Sri-Pathma, Alice Baxter, Jamie Robertson, [[Aaron Heslehurst]] and [[Sally Bundock]]. There is normally an extended bulletin at 16:45 when the main business stories of the day are discussed on ''Afternoon Live.'' Bundock and Thompson present ''Business Live'' on weekdays at 08:30. Declan Curry presented ''Your Money'', a weekly round-up on a Saturday morning.\n\n[[Rico Hizon]] or [[Sharanjit Leyl]] regularly present the main business stories during the early hours of the morning from Singapore during the BBC's ''[[Asia Business Report]]'', which is simulcast from BBC World News.  Alice Baxter and [[Sally Bundock]] present ''[[World Business Report]]''.\n\n== News presenters ==\n{{Details|List of BBC newsreaders and reporters}}\n* [[Sally Bundock]] ''The Briefing'', ''Business

Report''. [[Ros Atkins]] presents 'Outside Source'. Philippa Thomas, Alpa Patel, Karin Giannone or Kasia Madera present ''World News Today'' on Weekdays on [[BBC Four]] and weekends on the channel. [[Rico Hizon]] and [[Sharanjit Leyl]] (Reporting from Singapore), [[Babita Sharma]] and Madera are the main overnight presenters on the channel, appearing on ''Newsday'' and generic BBC News bulletins. These programmes are simulcast with [[BBC World News]] and either [[BBC One]] or [[BBC Two]]. Madera, [[Ben Bland]] and [[Mike Embley]] regularly present 02:00\u201305:00 weekdays and 01:00-06:00 weekends. Bundock or [[David Eades]]  present ''The Briefing'' and ''Business Briefing'' on weekday mornings on the channel and [[BBC One]].\n\nThe simulcasting of the main national news bulletins has led to the presenters of those bulletins appearing on the channel and offer relief on the news channel including Huw Edwards, [[Victoria Derbyshire]], [[Fiona Bruce]], [[George Alagiah]], [[Sophie Raworth]], [[Kate Silverton]] and [[Mishal Husain]]. The main ''[[BBC Breakfast|Breakfast]]'' presenters have also appeared on the channel since it was first launched as a simulcast programme in 2000, with the current presenters being [[Dan Walker (broadcaster)|Dan Walker]], [[Louise Minchin]], [[Charlie Stayt]] and Naga Munchetty.\n\nThomas presents the BBC World News programme [[Reporters (BBC News programme)|Reporters]] on the channel, while [[Gavin Esler]] presents ''[[Dateline London]]''. [[Stephen Sackur]] appears on ''[[HARDtalk]]'', which is aired weeknights and at weekends, while Zeinab Badawi, Carrie Gracie and [[Sarah Montague]] provide cover for him. [[Spencer Kelly]] presents the technology news programme ''[[Click (TV programme)|Click]]''. ''[[Newsnight]]'' host [[Evan Davis]] presents ''[[The Bottom Line (radio programme)|The Bottom Line]]''. [[Lee McKenzie]] presents ''Inside F1'' on Grand Prix weekend's. [[Tanya Beckett]] presents ''Talking Business'' and ''Witness''. [[Ade Adepitan]], Rajan Datar, Christa Larwood, Henry Golding and Carmen Robert present ''[[The Travel Show (BBC TV series)|The Travel Show]]''\n\nDuring a major news event one or more of the main news presenters may be sent to present live for the channel from the scene of the story, where they will conduct interviews with the people involved, question correspondents, introduce related reports and also give general information on the story, much as a reporter sent to cover a story would. The presenters often have expertise in the story they are sent to cover, for example channel presenters and former reporters Ben Brown and Clive Myrie were dispatched to [[Cairo]] and [[Tripoli]] during the Middle East uprisings.\n\n== Presentation ==\n\n=== Graphics ===\n{{Listen|filename=Bbc news theme 2007.ogg\n| title=BBC News theme|description=The BBC News title music by [[David Lowe (television and radio composer)|David Lowe]]}}\nThe channel was criticised at launch for its style of presentation, with accusations of it being less authoritative than the BBC One news bulletins, with presenters appearing on-screen without jackets. [[Jenny Abramsky]] had originally planned to have a television version of the informal news radio channel [[BBC Radio 5 Live]], or a TV version of [[Radio 4 News FM]] both of which she had run. The bright design of the set was also blamed for this \u2013 one insider reportedly described it as a \"car crash in a shower\"<ref name = \"kcvcng\"/> \u2013 and was subject to the network relaunch on 25 October 1999. The channel swapped studios with sister channel BBC World, moving to studio N8 within the newsroom, where it remained until 2008. New music and title sequences accompanied this set change, following the look of newly relaunched BBC One bulletins.\n\nGraphics and titles were developed by the [[Lambie-Nairn]] design agency and were gradually rolled out across the whole of BBC News, including a similar design for regional news starting with ''[[Newsroom South East]]'' and the three 'BBC Nations' \u2013 [[BBC Scotland|Scotland]], [[BBC Wales|Wales]] and [[BBC Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland]]. The similarity of main BBC News output was intended to increase the credibility of the channel as well as aiding cross-channel promotion.<ref name=\"aboutN24\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20040404035846/http://tvhome.co.uk/bbcnews24/about.phtml About BBC News] TV Home</ref>\n\nA graphics relaunch in January 2007 saw the channel updated, with redesigned headline straplines, a redesigned '[[digital on-screen graphic]]' and repositioned clock. The clock was originally placed to the left hand side of the channel name though following complaints that this could only be viewed in widescreen, it was moved to the right in February 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/theeditors/2007/01/fine_tuning.html|title=BBC News \u2013 The Editors \u2013 Fine tuning|date=22 January 2007}}</ref> Bulletins on BBC World News and BBC One also introduced similar graphics and title sequences on the same day.\n\nIn 2008, the graphics were again relaunched, using the style introduced in 2007 and a new colour scheme.\n\n=== The Lambert Report ===\nThe Lambert Report into the channel's performance in 2002 called upon News 24 to develop a better brand of its own, to allow viewers to differentiate between itself and similar channels such as [[Sky News]]. As a direct result of this, a brand new style across all presentation for the channel launched on 8 December 2003 at 09:00. [[Philip Hayton]] and [[Anna Jones]] were the first two presenters on the set, the relaunch of which had been put back a week due to previous power disruptions at Television Centre where the channel was based. The new designs also featured a dynamic set of titles for the channel; the globe would begin spinning from where the main story was taking place, while the headline scrolled around in a ribbon; this was occasionally replaced by the BBC News logo. The titles concluded with a red globe surrounded by a red stylised clamshell and BBC News ribbons forming above the BBC News logo.\n\nBulletins on BBC One moved into a new set in January 2003 although retained the previous ivory Lambie-Nairn titles until February 2004. News 24 updated the title colours slightly to match those of BBC One bulletins in time for the 50th anniversary of BBC television news on 5 July 2004.<ref>[http://www.tvradiobits.co.uk/idents/news24b.htm BBC News 24 2003\u201308]{{dead link|date=February 2013}} TV & Radio Bits</ref>\n\n=== Countdown sequence ===\n[[File:BBC News channel countdown.png|thumb|The countdown since 2005 has shown the elements of journalism and production involved in bringing news stories to air (2013 version shown).]]\n\nAn important part of the channel's presentation since launch has been the top of the hour countdown sequence, since there is no presentation system with continuity announcers so the countdown provides a link to the beginning of the next hour. A similar musical device is used on [[BBC Radio 5 Live]], and mirrors the [[BBC pips|pips]] on [[BBC Radio 4]].\n\nPrevious styles have included a series of fictional flags set to music between 1997 and 1999 before the major relaunch, incorporating the new contemporary music composed by [[David Lowe (television and radio composer)|David Lowe]], and graphics developed by [[Lambie-Nairn]]. Various images, originally ivory numbers fully animated against a deep red background, were designed to fit the pace of the channel, and the music soon gained notoriety, and was often satirised and parodied in popular culture, perhaps most famously by comic [[Bill Bailey]] who likened the theme music to an \"apocalyptic [[rave]]\". Images of life around the UK were added in replacement later with the same music, together with footage of the newsroom and exterior of Television Centre. The 2003 relaunch saw a small change to this style with less of a metropolitan feel to the footage.\n\nA new sequence was introduced on 28 March 2005, designed and created by [[Red Bee Media]] and directed by Mark Chaudoir. The full version ran for 60 seconds, though only around 30 seconds were usually shown on air. The music was revised completely but the biggest change came in the footage used \u2013 reflecting the methods and nature of newsgathering, while a strong emphasis was placed on the BBC logo itself. Satellite dishes are shown transmitting and receiving red \"data streams\". In production of the countdown sequence, Clive Norman filmed images around the United Kingdom, Richard Jopson in the United States, while BBC News cameramen filmed images from [[Iraq]], Beijing ([[Tiananmen Square]]), [[Bund of Shanghai]], Africa, as well as areas affected by the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|2004 Asian tsunami]] and others.\n\nThe sequence has since seen several remixes to the music and a change in visuals to focus more on the well-known journalists, with less footage of camera crews and production teams. Changes have also seen the channel logo included during the sequences and at the end, as well as the fonts used for the time. The conclusion of the countdown was altered in 2008 to feature the new presentation style, rather than a data stream moving in towards the camera. Also in 2008, the graphic for the countdown changed, resembling BBC One Rhythm and Movement Idents, due to the logo being in a red square in inferior-left corner.\n\nTo coincide with the move of BBC News to [[Broadcasting House#Second phase|Broadcasting House]], on 18 March 2013 the countdown was updated again along with several other presentation elements. Three of the most striking features of the new countdown include music performed by the [[BBC Concert Orchestra]], a redesign of the \"data streams\" and the ending of the sequence no longer fading to the BBC News globe and logo, but instead stopping with a time-lapse shot outside the corporation's headquarters. The countdown was also extended back to 90 seconds, of which approximately 86 were seen before the first hour from Broadcasting House.\n\nA full three-minute version of the countdown music was made available on [[BBC News Online]] and David Lowe's own website after a remix on 16 May 2006.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/talking_point/4992088.stm News 24 'releases' countdown music] \u2013 BBC News Online, 18 May 2006 {{Update inline|date=December 2016}}</ref>\n\nAn international version of the countdown was launched on BBC World News on 5 September 2005 featuring more international content and similar music. Various changes have been made to the music and visuals since then, with presentation following the style of BBC News. The visuals in the sequence were updated on 10 May 2010. In June 2011, further imagery was added relating to recent events, including the conflict in Libya and views of outside 10 Downing Street. In January 2013, as part of the relocation of BBC News to [[Broadcasting House#Second phase|Broadcasting House]] in Central London, BBC World News received a new countdown in the same style as the BBC News Channel's updated countdown, with some minor differences.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|BBC}}\n{{Wikipedia books|BBC Channels (UK)}}\n* [[List of television stations in the United Kingdom]]\n* [[Sky News]]\n* [[ITV News Channel]]\n* [[ABC News (TV channel)|ABC News Channel]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{bbc.co.uk|tv/bbcnews|BBC News}}\n** {{bbc.co.uk|/news/10318089|BBC News channel stream}} via [[BBC News Online]] (available to UK viewers only - TV Licence required)\n** {{bbc.co.uk|iplayer/live/bbcnews|title=BBC News channel stream}} via [[BBC iPlayer]] (available to UK viewers only - TV Licence required)\n\n{{BBC News}}\n{{Navboxes\n| list1=\n{{BBC Television}}\n{{Media in the United Kingdom|television}}\n{{Freeview}}\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bbc News (Tv Channel)}}\n[[Category:1997 establishments in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Television channels and stations established in 1997]]\n[[Category:24-hour television news channels in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:BBC television channels in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:BBC News channels]]\n[[Category:Television stations in Ireland]]\n[[Category:24-hour television news channels in India]]\n[[Category:Lost BBC episodes]]", "sha1": "ldz5o35vq5tw3dxfv1nuf1u8oqyxo59"}}, {"title": "Bill Oddie", "ns": "0", "id": "4622", "revision": {"id": "866482040", "parentid": "864731317", "timestamp": "2018-10-30T16:19:20Z", "contributor": {"username": "WereSpielChequers", "id": "4071608"}, "minor": "", "comment": "/* Natural history */[[WP:AWB/T|Typo fixing]], replaced: expose  \u2192 expos\u00e9", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Use British English|date=June 2015}}\n{{Infobox person\n | name             = Bill Oddie\n | honorific_suffix = [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]]\n | image            = Bill Oddie (383148953).jpg\n | caption          = Oddie in February 2007\n | image_size       = 220px\n | birth_date       = {{Birth date and age|1941|07|07|df=yes}}\n | birth_place      = [[Rochdale]], England{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n | birth_name       = William Edgar Oddie\n | occupation = Actor, writer, composer, musician, comedian, artist, [[ornithology|ornithologist]], conservationist, television presenter\n | party = [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green]]\n | spouse           = {{Plainlist|\n* Jean Hart (divorced)\n* {{marriage|Laura Beaumont|1983}}\n}}\n | children         = 3, including [[Kate Hardie]]\n | website          = {{Url|billoddie.com}}\n}}\n\n'''William Edgar Oddie''', {{post-nominals|country=UK|OBE}} (born 7 July 1941)<ref>{{cite book |title=From Fringe to Flying Circus: Celebrating a Unique Generation of Comedy 1960\u20131980 |first=Roger |last=Wilmut |publisher=Eyre Metheun |location=London |page=35 |isbn=0-413-46950-6}}</ref> is an English writer, composer, musician, comedian, artist, birder, conservationist, television presenter and actor.

Subsequently, he was a key member of the performers in the  [[BBC]] radio series ''[[I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again]]'', where many of his musical compositions were featured. Some were released on the album ''Distinctly Oddie'' (Polydor, 1967). He was one of the first performers to [[parody]] a rock song, arranging the traditional [[Yorkshire]] folk song \"[[On Ilkla Moor Baht'at]]\" in the style of [[Joe Cocker]]'s hit rendition of [[the Beatles]]' \"[[With a Little Help from My Friends]]\" (released on [[John Peel]]'s [[Dandelion Records]] in 1970 and featured in Peel's special box of most-treasured singles), and singing \"[[Andy Pandy]]\" in the style of a brassy soul number such as [[Wilson Pickett]] or [[Geno Washington]] might perform. In many shows he would do short impressions of [[Hughie Green]].\n\nOn television Oddie was co-writer and performer in the comedy series ''[[Twice a Fortnight]]'' with [[Graeme Garden]], [[Terry Jones]], [[Michael Palin]] and [[Jonathan Lynn]]. Later, he was co-writer and performer in the comedy series ''[[Broaden Your Mind]]'' with [[Tim Brooke-Taylor]] and Graeme Garden, for which Oddie became a cast member for the second series.\n\nOddie, Brooke-Taylor and Garden then co-wrote and appeared in their television comedy series ''[[The Goodies (TV series)|The Goodies]]''.

With the new redesign, the bike lane is now on the right side of the street; it was formerly on the left side adjacent to the pedestrian plazas, causing conflicts between pedestrian and bicycle traffic.<ref>[http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/2012-10-22-broadway-blvd-35-42.pdf Broadway Boulevard II]</ref>\n\nIn spring 2017,  as part of a capital reconstruction of Worth Square, Broadway between 24th and 25th Street was converted to a \"[[Shared space|shared street]]\" where through vehicles are banned and delivery vehicles are restricted to {{convert|5|mph|km/h}}.

Broadway's intersections with avenues, marked by \"[[town square|squares]]\" (some merely triangular slivers of open space), have induced some interesting architecture, such as the [[Flatiron Building]].\n\nAt [[Union Square, Manhattan|Union Square]], Broadway crosses [[14th Street (Manhattan)|14th Street]], merges with [[Park Avenue|Fourth Avenue]], and continues its diagonal uptown course from the Square's northwest corner; Union Square is the only location wherein the physical section of Broadway is discontinuous in Manhattan (other portions of Broadway in Manhattan are pedestrian-only plazas). At [[Madison Square]], the location of the Flatiron Building, Broadway crosses Fifth Avenue at [[23rd Street (Manhattan)|23rd Street]], and is discontinuous to vehicles for a one-block stretch between 24th and 25th Streets. At [[Greeley Square]] (West 33rd Street), Broadway crosses [[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|Sixth Avenue]] (Avenue of the Americas), and is discontinuous to vehicles. [[Macy's Herald Square]] department store, one block north of the vehicular discontinuity, is located on the northwest corner of Broadway and West 34th Street and southwest corner of Broadway and West 35th Street; it is one of the largest [[department store]]s in the world.\n\nOne famous stretch near [[Times Square]], where Broadway crosses Seventh Avenue in [[midtown Manhattan]], is the home of many [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[theatre (structure)|theatres]], housing an ever-changing array of commercial, large-scale plays, particularly [[musical theatre|musicals]]. This area of Manhattan is often called the [[Theater District, Manhattan|Theater District]] or the Great White Way, a nickname originating in the headline \"Found on the Great White Way\" in the edition of February 3, 1902 of the ''[[New York Evening Telegram]]''. The journalistic nickname was inspired by the millions of lights on theater [[Marquee (sign)|marquees]] and [[billboard (advertising)|billboard]] advertisements that illuminate the area. After becoming the city's de facto [[red-light district]] in the 1960s and 1970s (as can be seen in the films ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' and ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]''), since the late 1980s Times Square has emerged as a family tourist center, in effect being [[Disneyfication|Disneyfied]] following the company's purchase and renovation of the [[New Amsterdam Theatre]] on 42nd Street in 1993.<ref>Dunlap, David W.

Named [[Verdi Square]] in 1921 for its monument to Italian composer [[Giuseppe Verdi]], which was erected in 1909, this triangular sliver of public space was designated a Scenic Landmark by the Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1974, one of nine city parks that have received the designation.<ref>[https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/verdi-square Verdi Square], [[New York City Department of Parks and Recreation]].

For many years, all traffic on Broadway flowed on either side of this median and its subway entrance, and its uptown lanes went past it along the western edge of triangular Verdi Square.  In 2001 and 2002, renovation of the historic 72nd Street station and the addition of a second subway control house and passenger shelter on an adjacent center median just north of 72nd Street, across from the original building, resulted in the creation of a public plaza with stone pavers and extensive seating, connecting the newer building with Verdi Square, and making it necessary to divert northbound traffic to Amsterdam Avenue for one block.  While Broadway's southbound lanes at this intersection were unaffected by the new construction, its northbound lanes are no longer contiguous at this intersection.  Drivers can either continue along Amsterdam Avenue to head uptown or turn left on West 73rd Street to resume traveling on Broadway.\n\nSeveral notable apartment buildings are in close proximity to this intersection, including [[The Ansonia]], its ornate architecture dominating the cityscape here.

The Broadway Surface Railroad's [[Broadway Line (Lower Manhattan surface)|Broadway Line]], a [[cable car (railway)|cable car]] line, opened on lower Broadway (below Times Square) in 1893, and soon became the core of the [[Metropolitan Street Railway]], with two cable branches: the [[Broadway and Lexington Avenue Line]] and [[Broadway and Columbus Avenue Line]].\n\nThese streetcar lines were replaced with [[bus route]]s in the 1930s and 1940s. Before Broadway became one-way, the main bus routes along it were the [[New York City Omnibus Company]]'s (NYCO) [[6 (NYCO)|6]] (Broadway below Times Square), [[7 (NYCO)|7]] (Broadway and Columbus Avenue), and [[11 (NYCO)|11]] (Ninth and Amsterdam Avenues), and the [[Surface Transportation Corporation]]'s [[M100 (New York City bus)|M100]] (Kingsbridge) and [[M104 (New York City bus)|M104]] (Broadway Branch). Additionally, the [[Fifth Avenue Coach Company]]'s (FACCo) [[4 (FACCo)|4]] and 5 used Broadway from [[135th Street (Manhattan)|135th Street]] north to Washington Heights, and their 5 and 6 used Broadway between [[57th Street (Manhattan)|57th Street]] and [[72nd Street (Manhattan)|72nd Street]]. With the implementation of one-way traffic, the northbound 6 and 7 were moved to [[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|Sixth Avenue]].\n\n{{As of|2017}}, Broadway is served by the [[M4 (New York City bus)|M4]] (ex-FACCo 4), [[M7 (New York City bus)|M7]] (ex-NYCO 7), [[M55 (New York City bus)|M55]], [[M100 (New York City bus)|M100]], and [[M104 (New York City bus)|M104]].

It maps positions on the <math> j \\omega \\ </math> axis, <math> Re[s]=0 \\ </math>, in the [[s-plane]] to the [[unit circle]], <math> |z| = 1 \\ </math>, in the [[complex plane|z-plane]].  Other bilinear transforms can be used to warp the [[frequency response]] of any discrete-time linear system (for example to approximate the non-linear frequency resolution of the human auditory system) and are implementable in the discrete domain by replacing a system's unit delays <math> \\left( z^{-1} \\right) \\ </math> with first order [[all-pass filter]]s.\n\nThe transform preserves [[BIBO stability|stability]] and maps every point of the [[frequency response]] of the continuous-time filter, <math> H_a(j \\omega_a) \\ </math> to a corresponding point in the frequency response of the discrete-time filter, <math> H_d(e^{j \\omega_d T}) \\ </math> although to a somewhat different frequency, as shown in the [[#Frequency warping|Frequency warping]] section below.  This means that for every feature that one sees in the frequency response of the analog filter, there is a corresponding feature, with identical gain and phase shift, in the frequency response of the digital filter but, perhaps, at a somewhat different frequency.  This is barely noticeable at low frequencies but is quite evident at frequencies close to the [[Nyquist frequency]].\n\n== Discrete-time approximation ==\nThe bilinear transform is a first-order approximation of the natural logarithm function that is an exact mapping of the ''z''-plane to the ''s''-plane.  When the [[Laplace transform]] is performed on a discrete-time signal (with each element of the discrete-time sequence attached to a correspondingly delayed [[Dirac delta function|unit impulse]]), the result is precisely the [[Z transform]] of the discrete-time sequence with the substitution of\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nz &= e^{sT}   \\\\\n  &= \\frac{e^{sT/2}}{e^{-sT/2}} \\\\\n  &\\approx \\frac{1 + s T / 2}{1 - s T / 2}\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nwhere <math> T \\ </math> is the [[numerical integration]] step size of the [[trapezoidal rule]] used in the bilinear transform derivation;<ref>{{cite book |title=Discrete Time Signal Processing Third Edition |last=Oppenheim |first=Alan |year=2010 |publisher=Pearson Higher Education, Inc. |location=Upper Saddle River, NJ |isbn=978-0-13-198842-2 |page=504}}</ref> or, in other words, the sampling period. The above bilinear approximation can be solved for <math> s \\ </math> or a similar approximation for <math> s = (1/T) \\ln(z) \\  \\ </math> can be performed.\n\nThe inverse of this mapping (and its first-order bilinear [[Logarithm#Power series|approximation]]) is\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\ns &= \\frac{1}{T} \\ln(z)  \\\\\n  &= \\frac{2}{T} \\left[\\frac{z-1}{z+1} + \\frac{1}{3} \\left( \\frac{z-1}{z+1} \\right)^3  + \\frac{1}{5} \\left( \\frac{z-1}{z+1} \\right)^5  + \\frac{1}{7} \\left( \\frac{z-1}{z+1} \\right)^7 + \\cdots \\right] \\\\\n  &\\approx  \\frac{2}{T} \\frac{z - 1}{z + 1} \\\\\n  &=  \\frac{2}{T} \\frac{1 - z^{-1}}{1 + z^{-1}}\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThe bilinear transform essentially uses this first order approximation and substitutes into the continuous-time transfer function, <math> H_a(s) \\ </math>\n\n:<math>s \\leftarrow \\frac{2}{T} \\frac{z - 1}{z + 1}.</math>\n\nThat is\n\n:<math>H_d(z) = H_a(s) \\bigg|_{s = \\frac{2}{T} \\frac{z - 1}{z + 1}}= H_a \\left( \\frac{2}{T} \\frac{z-1}{z+1} \\right). \\ </math>\n\n== Stability and minimum-phase property preserved ==\nA continuous-time causal filter is [[BIBO stability|stable]] if the [[Pole (complex analysis)|poles]] of its transfer function fall in the left half of the [[complex number|complex]] [[s-plane]]. A discrete-time causal filter is stable if the poles of its transfer function fall inside the [[unit circle]] in the [[complex plane|complex z-plane]]. The bilinear transform maps the left half of the complex s-plane to the interior of the unit circle in the z-plane. Thus, filters designed in the continuous-time domain that are stable are converted to filters in the discrete-time domain that preserve that stability.\n\nLikewise, a continuous-time filter is [[minimum-phase]] if the [[Zero (complex analysis)|zeros]] of its transfer function fall in the left half of the complex s-plane. A discrete-time filter is minimum-phase if the zeros of its transfer function fall inside the unit circle in the complex z-plane. Then the same mapping property assures that continuous-time filters that are minimum-phase are converted to discrete-time filters that preserve that property of being minimum-phase.\n\n== Example ==\nAs an example take a simple [[low-pass]] [[RC filter]].  This continuous-time filter has a transfer function\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nH_a(s) &= \\frac{1/sC}{R+1/sC} \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{1 + RC s}.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nIf we wish to implement this filter as a digital filter, we can apply the bilinear transform by substituting for <math>s</math> the formula above; after some reworking, we get the following filter representation:\n\n:{|\n|-\n|<math>H_d(z) \\ </math>\n|<math> =H_a \\left( \\frac{2}{T} \\frac{z-1}{z+1}\\right) \\ </math>\n|-\n|\n|<math>= \\frac{1}{1 + RC \\left( \\frac{2}{T} \\frac{z-1}{z+1}\\right)} \\ </math>\n|-\n|\n|<math>= \\frac{1 + z}{(1 - 2 RC / T) + (1 + 2RC / T) z} \\ </math>\n|-\n|\n|<math>= \\frac{1 + z^{-1}}{(1 + 2RC / T) + (1 - 2RC / T) z^{-1}}. \\ </math>\n|}\n\nThe coefficients of the denominator are the 'feed-backward' coefficients and the coefficients of the numerator are the 'feed-forward' coefficients used to implement a real-time [[digital filter]].\n\n== General second-order biquad transformation ==\nIt is possible to relate the coefficients of a continuous-time, analog filter with those of a similar discrete-time digital filter created through the bilinear transform process. Transforming a general, second-order continuous-time filter with the given transfer function\n\n:<math>H_a(s) = \\frac{b_0 s^2 + b_1 s + b_2}{a_0 s^2 + a_1 s + a_2} = \\frac{b_0 + b_1 s^{-1} + b_2 s^{-2}}{a_0 + a_1 s^{-1} + a_2 s^{-2}}</math>\n\nusing the bilinear transform (without prewarping any frequency specification) requires the substitution of\n\n:<math>s \\leftarrow K \\frac{1 - z^{-1}}{1 + z^{-1}}</math>\n\nwhere\n\n:<math>K \\triangleq \\frac{2}{T} </math>.\n\nHowever, if the frequency warping compensation as described below is used in the bilinear transform, so that both analog and digital filter gain and phase agree at frequency <math>\\omega_0</math>, then\n\n:<math>K \\triangleq \\frac{\\omega_0}{\\tan\\left(\\frac{\\omega_0 T}{2}\\right)} </math>.\n\nThis results in a discrete-time [[digital biquad filter]] with coefficients expressed in terms of the coefficients of the original continuous time filter:\n:<math>H_d(z)=\\frac{(b_0 K^2 + b_1 K + b_2) + (2b_2 - 2b_0 K^2)z^{-1} + (b_0 K^2 - b_1 K + b_2)z^{-2}}{(a_0 K^2 + a_1 K + a_2) + (2a_2 - 2a_0 K^2)z^{-1} + (a_0 K^2 - a_1 K + a_2)z^{-2}}</math>\n\nNormally the constant term in the denominator must be normalized to 1 before deriving the corresponding [[difference equation]].  This results in\n\n:<math>H_d(z)=\\frac{\\frac{b_0 K^2 + b_1 K + b_2}{a_0 K^2 + a_1 K + a_2} + \\frac{2b_2 - 2b_0 K^2}{a_0 K^2 + a_1 K + a_2}z^{-1} + \\frac{b_0 K^2 - b_1 K + b_2}{a_0 K^2 + a_1 K + a_2}z^{-2}}{1 + \\frac{2a_2 - 2a_0 K^2}{a_0 K^2 + a_1 K + a_2}z^{-1} + \\frac{a_0 K^2 - a_1 K + a_2}{a_0 K^2 + a_1 K + a_2}z^{-2}}. </math>\n\nThe difference equation (using the [[Digital filter#Direct Form I|Direct Form I]]) is\n\n:<math>\ny[n] = \\frac{b_0 K^2 + b_1 K + b_2}{a_0 K^2 + a_1 K + a_2} \\cdot x[n] + \\frac{2b_2 - 2b_0 K^2}{a_0 K^2 + a_1 K + a_2} \\cdot x[n-1] + \\frac{b_0 K^2 - b_1 K + b_2}{a_0 K^2 + a_1 K + a_2} \\cdot x[n-2] - \\frac{2a_2 - 2a_0 K^2}{a_0 K^2 + a_1 K + a_2} \\cdot y[n-1] - \\frac{a_0 K^2 - a_1 K + a_2}{a_0 K^2 + a_1 K + a_2} \\cdot y[n-2] \\ .\n</math>\n\n== Frequency warping ==\nTo determine the frequency response of a continuous-time filter, the [[transfer function]] <math> H_a(s) </math> is evaluated at <math>s = j \\omega_a </math> which is on the <math> j \\omega </math> axis.  Likewise, to determine the frequency response of a discrete-time filter, the transfer function <math> H_d(z) </math> is evaluated at <math>z = e^{ j \\omega_d T} </math> which is on the unit circle, <math> |z| = 1 </math>.  The bilinear transform maps the <math> j \\omega </math> axis of the ''s''-plane (of which is the domain of <math> H_a(s) </math>) to the unit circle of the ''z''-plane, <math> |z| = 1 </math> (which is the domain of <math> H_d(z) </math>), but it is '''not''' the same mapping <math> z = e^{sT} </math> which also maps the <math> j \\omega </math> axis to the unit circle.  When the actual frequency of <math> \\omega_d </math> is input to the discrete-time filter designed by use of the bilinear transform, then it is desired to know at what frequency, <math> \\omega_a </math>, for the continuous-time filter that this <math> \\omega_d </math> is mapped to.\n\n:<math>H_d(z) = H_a \\left( \\frac{2}{T} \\frac{z-1}{z+1}\\right) </math>\n\n:{|\n|-\n|<math>H_d(e^{ j \\omega_d T}) </math>\n|<math>= H_a \\left( \\frac{2}{T} \\frac{e^{ j \\omega_d T} - 1}{e^{ j \\omega_d T} + 1}\\right) </math>\n|-\n|\n|<math>= H_a \\left( \\frac{2}{T} \\cdot \\frac{e^{j \\omega_d T/2} \\left(e^{j \\omega_d T/2} - e^{-j \\omega_d T/2}\\right)}{e^{j \\omega_d T/2} \\left(e^{j \\omega_d T/2} + e^{-j \\omega_d T/2 }\\right)}\\right) </math>\n|-\n|\n|<math>= H_a \\left( \\frac{2}{T} \\cdot \\frac{\\left(e^{j \\omega_d T/2} - e^{-j \\omega_d T/2}\\right)}{\\left(e^{j \\omega_d T/2} + e^{-j \\omega_d T/2 }\\right)}\\right) </math>\n|-\n|\n|<math>= H_a \\left(j \\frac{2}{T} \\cdot \\frac{ \\left(e^{j \\omega_d T/2} - e^{-j \\omega_d T/2}\\right) /(2j)}{\\left(e^{j \\omega_d T/2} + e^{-j \\omega_d T/2 }\\right) / 2}\\right) </math>\n|-\n|\n|<math>= H_a \\left(j \\frac{2}{T} \\cdot \\frac{ \\sin(\\omega_d T/2) }{ \\cos(\\omega_d T/2) }\\right) </math>\n|-\n|\n|<math>= H_a \\left(j \\frac{2}{T} \\cdot \\tan \\left( \\omega_d T/2 \\right) \\right) </math>\n|}\n\nThis shows that every point on the unit circle in the discrete-time filter z-plane, <math>z = e^{ j \\omega_d T}</math> is mapped to a point on the <math>j \\omega</math> axis on the continuous-time filter s-plane, <math>s = j \\omega_a</math>. That is, the discrete-time to continuous-time frequency mapping of the bilinear transform is\n\n:<math> \\omega_a = \\frac{2}{T} \\tan \\left( \\omega_d \\frac{T}{2} \\right) </math>\n\nand the inverse mapping is\n\n:<math> \\omega_d = \\frac{2}{T} \\arctan \\left( \\omega_a \\frac{T}{2} \\right). </math>\n\nThe discrete-time filter behaves at frequency <math>\\omega_d</math> the same way that the continuous-time filter behaves at frequency <math> (2/T) \\tan(\\omega_d T/2) </math>.  Specifically, the gain and phase shift that the discrete-time filter has at frequency <math>\\omega_d</math> is the same gain and phase shift that the continuous-time filter has at frequency <math>(2/T) \\tan(\\omega_d T/2)</math>.  This means that every feature, every \"bump\" that is visible in the frequency response of the continuous-time filter is also visible in the discrete-time filter, but at a different frequency.  For low frequencies (that is, when <math>\\omega_d \\ll 2/T</math> or <math>\\omega_a \\ll 2/T</math>), then the features are mapped to a ''slightly'' different frequency; <math>\\omega_d \\approx \\omega_a </math>.\n\nOne can see that the entire continuous frequency range\n\n: <math> -\\infty < \\omega_a < +\\infty </math>\n\nis mapped onto the fundamental frequency interval\n\n: <math> -\\frac{\\pi}{T} < \\omega_d < +\\frac{\\pi}{T}. </math>\n\nThe continuous-time filter frequency <math> \\omega_a = 0 </math> corresponds to the discrete-time filter frequency <math> \\omega_d = 0 </math> and the continuous-time filter frequency <math> \\omega_a = \\pm \\infty </math> correspond to the discrete-time filter frequency <math> \\omega_d = \\pm \\pi / T. </math>\n\nOne can also see that there is a nonlinear relationship between <math> \\omega_a \\ </math> and <math> \\omega_d.</math>  This effect of the bilinear transform is called '''frequency warping'''. The continuous-time filter can be designed to compensate for this frequency warping by setting <math> \\omega_a = \\frac{2}{T} \\tan \\left( \\omega_d \\frac{T}{2} \\right) </math> for every frequency specification that the designer has control over (such as corner frequency or center frequency).  This is called '''pre-warping''' the filter design.\n\nIt is possible, however, to compensate for the frequency warping by pre-warping a frequency specification <math> \\omega_0 </math> (usually a resonant frequency or the frequency of the most significant feature of the frequency response) of the continuous-time system.  These pre-warped specifications may then be used in the bilinear transform to obtain the desired discrete-time system. When designing a digital filter as an approximation of a continuous time filter, the frequency response (both amplitude and phase) of the digital filter can be made to match the frequency response of the continuous filter at a specified frequency <math> \\omega_0 </math>, as well as matching at DC, if the following transform is substituted into the continuous filter transfer function.<ref>{{cite book |last=Astrom |first=Karl J. |date=1990 |title=Computer Controlled Systems, Theory and Design |edition=Second |publisher=Prentice-Hall |page=212 |isbn=0-13-168600-3}}</ref> This is a modified version of Tustin's transform shown above.\n\n:<math>s \\leftarrow \\frac{\\omega_0}{\\tan\\left(\\frac{\\omega_0 T}{2}\\right)} \\frac{z - 1}{z + 1}.</math>\n\nHowever, note that this transform becomes the original transform\n\n:<math>s \\leftarrow \\frac{2}{T} \\frac{z - 1}{z + 1}</math>\n\nas <math> \\omega_0 \\to 0 </math>.\n\nThe main advantage of the warping phenomenon is the absence of aliasing distortion of the frequency response characteristic, such as observed with [[Impulse invariance]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Impulse invariance]]\n* [[Matched Z-transform method]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mechanical-engineering/2-161-signal-processing-continuous-and-discrete-fall-2008/lecture-notes/lecture_19.pdf MIT OpenCourseWare Signal Processing: Continuous to Discrete Filter Design]\n* [http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~tymerski/ece452/6.pdf Lecture Notes on Discrete Equivalents]\n\n{{DSP}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bilinear Transform}}\n[[Category:Digital signal processing]]\n[[Category:Transforms]]\n[[Category:Control theory]]", "sha1": "08dlhdoh1gxm6zk3uwoig5jja4iiw23"}}, {"title": "Brian Boitano", "ns": "0", "id": "4631", "revision": {"id": "855449564", "parentid": "845757028", "timestamp": "2018-08-18T11:12:28Z", "contributor": {"username": "Trijnstel", "id": "9748276"}, "comment": "/* Results */ +more results", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Use mdy dates|date=August 2014}}\n{{Infobox figure skater\n|name= Brian Boitano\n|image=Brian Boitano in 2010.jpg\n|caption=Boitano in San Francisco in 2010\n|fullname = Brian Anthony Boitano\n|birth_date= {{Birth date and age|1963|10|22}}\n|birth_place= [[Mountain View, California]], U.S.\n|residence= [[San Francisco]], California\n|height= 5 ft 11 in\n|formercoach= Linda Leaver <br> [[Sandra Bezic]]\n|skating club= Peninsula FSC\n|retired= 1988, 1994\n|medaltemplates= <!-- see [[Template:MedalRelatedTemplates]] -->\n{{MedalCountry |United States}}\n{{MedalSport | Men's [[Figure skating]]}}\n{{MedalCompetition|[[Figure skating at the Winter Olympics|Olympic Games]]}}\n{{MedalGold| [[Figure skating at the 1988 Winter Olympics|1988 Calgary]] | [[Figure skating at the 1988 Winter Olympics#Men|Men's singles]]}}\n{{MedalCompetition|[[World Figure Skating Championships|World Championships]]}}\n{{MedalGold| [[1986 World Figure Skating Championships|1986 Geneva]] |Men's singles}}\n{{MedalGold| [[1988 World Figure Skating Championships|1988 Budapest]] |Men's singles}}\n{{MedalSilver| [[1987 World Figure Skating Championships|1987 Cincinnati]] |Men's singles}}\n{{MedalBronze| [[1985 World Figure Skating Championships|1985 Tokyo]] |Men's singles}}\n{{MedalCompetition|[[World Junior Figure Skating Championships|World Junior Championships]]}}\n{{MedalBronze|[[1978 World Junior Figure Skating Championships|1978 Meg\u00e8ve]]|Men's singles}}\n}}\n\n'''Brian Anthony Boitano''' (born October 22, 1963)<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/brian-boitano/bio/214572 | title = Brian Boitano: Biography | publisher = [[TV Guide|TVGuide.com]] | accessdate= December 19, 2013}}</ref> is an American [[Figure skating|figure skater]] from [[Sunnyvale, California]].

In 1987 he introduced his signature jump, the 'Boitano triple [[lutz jump|lutz]]' in which the skater raises his left arm above his head. He attempted a quadruple jump throughout the 1986\u201387 season and at the 1988 [[World Figure Skating Championships]], but did not cleanly land the jump; he double-footed the landing on two occasions.\n\nBoitano was known primarily as a jumper early in his career and he, along with several other skaters, helped push the technical envelope of men's skating. It was not until his failure to defend his World title in 1987 that he focused specifically on improving his artistry.\n\nBoitano placed second at the 1984 [[United States Figure Skating Championships]], earning himself a trip to the [[1984 Winter Olympics]]. He placed 5th at the Olympics, setting the stage for his success over the next four years.\n\n===World Champion===\nFollowing the 1984 Olympics, several skaters emerged as likely medal hopes following the retirement of [[Scott Hamilton (figure skater)|Scott Hamilton]].\n\nBoitano won the 1985 [[United States Figure Skating Championships]], the first of his four titles. At the first [[1985 World Figure Skating Championships|World Championships]] of the post-Hamilton era in 1985, [[Alexander Fadeev (figure skater)|Alexander Fadeev]] won, with [[Brian Orser]] finishing 2nd and Boitano 3rd. He had injured tendons in his right ankle a few weeks before the 1986 U.S. Championships but went on to win his second national title.<ref name=si021786>{{cite news | url = http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1064528/1/index.htm | title = Books Or Blades, There's No Doubting Thomas | first = E.M.| last = Swift |date = February 17, 1986 | publisher = [[Sports Illustrated]] | accessdate = June 18, 2011}}</ref> At the [[1986 World Figure Skating Championships|1986 World Championships]], Boitano took the title, while Fadeev had a disastrous free skate despite having been in an excellent position to win; Orser finished 2nd once again.\n\nDuring the 1986\u201387 season, Boitano had introduced two new elements to his programs: the 'Tano triple [[lutz jump|lutz]] and a quadruple [[toe loop jump|toe loop]], although he never succeeded in landing a clean quadruple jump in competition. The 1987 World Championships were held in [[Cincinnati]], giving defending World champion Boitano a home-field advantage. The outcome of the event would set the tone for the 1988 Olympics. At Worlds, Boitano fell on his quadruple toe loop attempt and placed second.\n\nAfter losing the world title to Orser at home, Boitano and his coach [[Linda Leaver]] decided that some changes needed to be made if Boitano was to become the Olympic champion.<ref name=\"passiontoskate\">{{Cite book|last=Bezic |first=Sandra |authorlink=Sandra Bezic |author2=Hayes, David |authorlink2=David Hayes (author) |title=The Passion to Skate: An Intimate View of Figure Skating |year=1998 |publisher=Andrews McMeel Pub |location= |isbn=0-8362-6452-5 }}</ref> Boitano had always been good at the technical requirements (\"The first mark\"), but he was weak on the artistic (\"the second mark\"). He was a self-described \"jumping robot.\" In order to help his growth as an artist, he hired choreographer [[Sandra Bezic]] to choreograph his programs for the 1987\u20131988 Olympic season.<ref name=\"passiontoskate\" />\n\nBezic choreographed two programs that featured clean lines and accentuated the skating abilities of the 5' 11\" Boitano.<ref name=\"passiontoskate\" />  The short program was based on [[Giacomo Meyerbeer]]'s ballet ''Les Patineurs'' in which Boitano plays a cocky young man showing off his tricks, using movements dating back to the 19th century.<ref name=\"passiontoskate\" /> In one famous moment, Boitano wipes ice shavings, also called snow, off his skate blade and tosses it over his shoulder after landing a triple axel combination. The free skating program was based on the film score, ''Napoleon'', detailing various phases of a soldier's life.<ref name=\"passiontoskate\" />\n\nBoitano debuted his new programs at 1987 [[Skate Canada International|Skate Canada]], held in the [[Saddledome]] in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]], Canada, the same venue in which he would compete against Brian Orser for the Olympic title three months later. Boitano's new programs were received with standing ovations by the audience. Although Orser won the competition, Boitano skated clean, landing seven triple jumps, including a footwork section into a jump. He did however pop his planned 2nd triple axel.  Boitano, Leaver, and Bezic were so confident about the strength of Boitano's new programs that they omitted the quadruple toe loop, which if landed, could have put him a shoulder above Orser in technical merit.\n\nThe short program at the 1988 [[United States Figure Skating Championships]] proved to be a highlight. Boitano received marks of 6.0 from eight of the nine judges for presentation, the second mark. His free skate was flawed.<ref name=\"passiontoskate\" /> Due to delays, he did not skate until after midnight. Still, Boitano won the competition, and went into the Olympics as the national champion (U.S.), as did Orser (Canadian).\n\n===1988 Olympics: Battle of the Brians===\n{{Main|Battle of the Brians}}\nGoing into the Olympics, Boitano and [[Brian Orser]] each had won a World title and each had an excellent, balanced repertoire, with Boitano being known as the slightly better technician and Orser as the better artist. Adding to the rivalry, Boitano and Orser were both performing military-themed programs. Boitano's was to the music of Napoleon.\n\nThe [[Battle of the Brians]] at the [[Figure skating at the 1988 Winter Olympics|1988 Winter Olympics]] was the highlight of Boitano's amateur career. Boitano and Orser were effectively tied going into the [[free skating]] portion of the event and whoever won that portion would win the event. [[Alexander Vladimirovich Fadeyev|Alexander Fadeev]] had won the [[compulsory figures]] section of the competition with Boitano second and Orser third. In the [[Short program (figure skating)|short program]], Orser placed first and Boitano second. The [[free skating]] was, at the time, worth 50% of the score, and so Boitano's lead would not be enough to hold him in first place if he lost the free skate.\n\nBoitano skated a clean, technically excellent long program, with eight triple jumps, two Axels, and a triple-triple combination. Orser made one small mistake on a jump and omitted his planned second triple axel. Boitano won the Battle in a 5\u20134 split. Boitano won the gold medal, wearing skates with American flag appliqu\u00e9s that are now part of the collections of the [[National Museum of American History]] at the [[Smithsonian Institution]].\n\nFollowing the Olympics, both Orser and Boitano went to the World Championships, which Boitano won. Boitano turned professional soon after.\n\n===Professional career and return to amateur standing===\nFollowing the Olympics, Boitano went on to dominate competitions in the professional ranks, winning 10 straight professional competitions, including 5 consecutive World Professional Championship titles and 4 consecutive wins at the Challenge of Champions. Boitano also appeared in ''[[Carmen on Ice]]'', for which he won an [[Emmy]]. However, Boitano wanted to return to amateur competition and make another run at the Olympics.\n\nBoitano's lobby proved successful and in June 1993, the [[International Skating Union]] (ISU) introduced a clause, commonly known as the \"Boitano rule,\" which allowed professionals to reinstate as \"amateur\" or \"eligible\" skaters. This had been the result of Boitano's active involvement during the early 1990s, which saw professionals being allowed in the Olympic Games in the sports of tennis and basketball.<ref>{{Cite news\n |last=Knisley \n |first=Michael \n |title=1998 Ad \n |publisher=Sporting News \n |date=March 7, 1994 \n |url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1208/is_n10_v217/ai_15194066/pg_1 \n |accessdate=December 7, 2006 \n}}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Boitano reinstated as an amateur to compete in the [[1994 Winter Olympics]] in [[Lillehammer]], [[Norway]].\n\nBoitano competed at the 1994 [[United States Figure Skating Championships]], led after the short program, but lost to [[Scott Davis (figure skater)|Scott Davis]] in the long program in a 6\u20133 split decision.

Bombardier started as a maker of [[snowmobile]]s, and is now a large manufacturer of [[regional airliner]]s, [[business jet]]s, and [[mass transportation]] equipment, as well as a provider of financial services.\n\n==History==\nBombardier was founded by [[Joseph-Armand Bombardier]] as ''L'Auto-Neige Bombardier Limit\u00e9e'' (\"Bombardier Snow Car Limited\") on July 10, 1942, at [[Valcourt (city), Quebec|Valcourt]] in the [[Eastern Townships]], [[Quebec]].<ref name=\"Creation\"/> A mechanic who dreamed of building a vehicle that could \"float on snow;\"{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} in 1935 Bombardier designed and produced his first [[snowmobile]] in a small [[Valcourt (city), Quebec|Valcourt, Quebec]] repair shop, following the death of his two-year-old from [[appendicitis]] complicated by [[peritonitis]] in January 1934, when a blizzard prevented him from reaching hospital in time to save his son.<ref>[https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/joseph-armand-bombardier/ ''The Canadian Encyclopedia'']\"Historica Canada: Joseph-Armand Bombardier\".

In 1937 Bombardier sold 12 snowmobiles, named the B7 and, in 1942, created l'Auto-Neige Bombardier Limit\u00e9e company.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nThe first snowmobiles were large, multipassenger vehicles designed to help people get around during the long winter months. Snowmobiles were used in rural Quebec to take children to school, carry freight, deliver mail, and as ambulances. His invention filled a very particular need in the region and soon business was booming. In&nbsp;1941 Armand opened a new factory in Valcourt. Then a major setback hit the growing business: the [[World War&nbsp;II|Second World War]] was well underway and the Canadian government issued wartime rationing regulations. Bombardier customers had to prove that snowmobiles were essential to their livelihood in order to buy one. To keep his business going, Armand shifted his focus and developed vehicles for the military. After the war, Bombardier experienced another setback in his snowmobile business. In&nbsp;1948, the Quebec government passed a law requiring all highways and local roads to be cleared of snow; the Bombardier company's sales fell by nearly half in one year. Armand Bombardier therefore decided to diversify his business, first by producing tracked snowplows sized specifically for use on municipal sidewalks (replacing [[horse-drawn vehicles]]), then by making all-terrain vehicles for the [[mining]], oil, and [[forestry]] industries.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n[[File:BombardierSnowmobile-pjt.jpg|thumb|Bombardier snowmobile, built in 1952]]\nOf note, the machines had removable front skis that could be replaced with front wheels for use on paved or hard surfaces, thus providing greater utility to his large snowmobiles. Production of these machines evolved over time.  During 1951, the wooden bodies were replaced with sheet steel and these vehicles were powered by [[Chrysler]] flathead six-cylinder engines and 3-speed manual transmissions. In the&nbsp;1960s, V-8&nbsp;engines began to appear and during the 1969/1970 production years, the standard round \"porthole\"-style windows were replaced with larger rectangular windows which allowed more interior light and made them feel less claustrophobic. Following these changes came the switchover to more reliable [[Chrysler]] Industrial 318 engines with the automatic Loadflite transmissions. Production of these machines continued into the mid-1970s.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nBombardier wanted to develop a fast, lightweight snowmobile that could carry one or two people. In the early 1950s, Armand set aside his dream to focus on developing his company's other tracked vehicles, but by the end of the decade, smaller, more efficient engines had been developed and were starting to come onto the market. Bombardier resumed his efforts to build a \"miniature\" snowmobile. He worked alongside his eldest son Germain, who shared his father's mechanical talents. Armand and Germain developed several prototypes of the lightweight snowmobile and finally, the first Bombardier snowmobile went on sale in 1959.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n[[File:BR100+sidea.jpg|thumb|right|Bombardier BR100+ Groomer, mid engine, hard cab model]]\n\nThe [[Ski-Doo]] snowmobile was originally called the \"Ski-Dog\" because Bombardier meant it to be a practical vehicle to replace the dogsled for hunters and trappers. By an accident, a painter misinterpreted the name and painted \"Ski-Doo\" on the first prototype.<ref>{{cite journal\n | last = Skorupa\n | first = Joe\n | title = Ski-doo: 50 years on snow\n | journal = Popular Mechanics\n | volume = 169\n | issue = 1\n | pages = 94, 95\n | publisher = Hearst Magazines\n | location = New York, NY\n | date = January 1992\n | url = https://books.google.ca/books?id=seMDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA94&dq=%22Ski-doo:+50+years+on+snow%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Ok1mUd6mNcWZqgHekoDgDw&ved=0CDwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22Ski-doo%3A%2050%20years%20on%20snow%22&f=false\n | jstor =\n | issn = 0032-4558\n | accessdate = Apr 11, 2013}}</ref> The public soon discovered that speedy vehicles that could zoom over snow were a lot of fun. Suddenly a new winter sport was born, centred in Quebec. In the first year, Bombardier sold 225&nbsp;Ski-Doos; four years later, 8,210 were sold. But Armand was reluctant to focus too much on the Ski-Doo and move resources away from his all-terrain vehicles. He vividly remembered his earlier business setbacks that forced him to diversify. Armand slowed down promotion of the Ski-Doo line to prevent it from dominating the other company products, while still allowing him to dominate the snowmobile industry.  The snowmobiles produced were of exceptional quality and performance, earning a better reputation than the rival [[Polaris Industries|Polaris]] and [[Arctic Cat]] brand of motosleds. In&nbsp;1971, Bombardier completed the purchase of the [[Moto-Ski]] company.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nOn February&nbsp;18,&nbsp;1964, J.&nbsp;Armand Bombardier died of cancer at age&nbsp;56. He left behind a thriving business, but also one that had been focused on one person. Armand dominated his company, overseeing all areas of operation. He controlled the small research department, making all the drawings himself. By the time of his death sales of the company had reached [[Canadian dollar|C$]]20&nbsp;[[million]], which is the equivalent of C$160&nbsp;million in 2004&nbsp;dollars. The younger generation took over, led by Armand's sons and sons-in-law. The young team reorganized and decentralized the company, adopting modern business tactics. The company adopted the latest technological innovation\u2014the computer\u2014to handle inventory, accounts, and billing. Distribution networks were improved and increased, and an incentive program was developed for sales staff.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nIn&nbsp;1967 L'Auto-Neige Bombardier Limit\u00e9e was renamed ''Bombardier Limited'' and on January&nbsp;23,&nbsp;1969, the company went public, listing on the [[Montreal Exchange|Montreal]] and [[Toronto Stock Exchange|Toronto]] [[stock exchange]]s.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nIn October 2016, Bombardier Inc. announced that, by the end of 2018, they will slash up to 7,500 jobs or more than 10 percent of 70,900 employees from 2015.

In 2006, the Bombardier ATV was rebranded as Can-Am. Can-Am was the name of the line of dirt bikes it produced in the 1980s which used high-tech engines featuring Rotax Automatic Variable Exhaust (RAVE) valving to create peak power at a wider range of RPMs.  The bikes were shelved but technology tweaks re-emerged in the company's Ski-Doo snowmobiles (beginning with the 1989 model year Ski-Doo Mach 1).  Many of today's snowmobiles produced by the company feature proprietary engineering by BRP's Rotax brand engine production plant located in Austria.

In modern usage, the key has no well-defined purpose, but while this is the case, it can be used by software for miscellaneous tasks, such as to switch between multiple login sessions, to terminate a program, or to interrupt a modem connection.\n\nBecause the break function is usually combined with the pause function on one key since the introduction of the [[IBM Model M]] 101-key keyboard in 1985, the Break key is also called the '''Pause key'''. It can be used to pause some [[computer game]]s.\n\n==History==\nA standard telegraph circuit connects all the keys, [[Telegraph sounder|sounders]] and batteries in a single series loop. Thus the sounders actuate only when both keys are down (closed, also known as \"marking\" &mdash; after the ink marks made on paper tape by early printing telegraphs). So the receiving operator has to hold their key down or close a built-in shorting switch in order to let the other operator send. As a consequence, the receiving operator could interrupt the sending operator by opening their key, breaking the circuit and forcing it into a \"spacing\" condition. Both sounders stop responding to the sender's keying, alerting the sender. (A physical break in the telegraph line would have the same effect.)\n\nThe [[teleprinter]] operated in a very similar fashion except that the sending station kept the loop closed (logic 1, or \"marking\") even during short pauses between characters. Holding down a special \"break\" key opened the loop, forcing it into a continuous logic 0, or \"spacing\", condition. When this occurred, the teleprinter mechanisms continually actuated without printing anything, as the all-0s character is the non-printing ''NUL'' in both [[Baudot code|Baudot]] and [[ASCII]]. The resulting noise got the sending operator's attention.\n\nThis practice carried over to teleprinter use on [[time-sharing]] computers. A continuous spacing (logical 0) condition violates the rule that every valid character has to end with one or more logic 1 (marking) \"stop\" bits. The computer (specifically the [[UART]]) recognized this as a special \"break\" condition and generated an [[interrupt]] that typically stopped a running program or forced the operating system to prompt for a login. Although asynchronous serial telegraphy is now rare, the {{keypress|Break}} key once used with terminal emulators can still be used by software for similar purposes.\n\n==Sinclair==\nOn the [[Sinclair ZX80]] and [[Sinclair ZX81|ZX81]] computers, the Break is accessed by pressing Space. On the [[Sinclair ZX Spectrum]] it is accessed by {{keypress|Caps Shift|Space}}. The Spectrum+ and later computers have a dedicated {{keypress|Break}} key. It does not trigger an interrupt but will halt any running BASIC program, or terminate the loading or saving of data to cassette tape. An interrupted BASIC program can usually be resumed with the <code>CONTINUE</code> command. The [[Sinclair QL]] computer, without a {{keypress|Break}} key, maps the function to {{keypress|Ctrl|Space}}.\n\n==BBC Micro==\nOn a [[BBC Micro]] computer, the {{keypress|Break}} key generates a hardware reset which would normally cause a [[warm restart]] of the computer. A [[cold restart]] is triggered by pressing {{keypress|Ctrl|Break}}. If a filing system is installed, {{keypress|Shift|Break}} will cause the computer to search for and load or run a file called <code>!Boot</code> on the filing system's default device (e.g. floppy disk 0, network user BOOT). The latter two behaviours were inherited by the successor to [[Acorn MOS]], [[RISC OS]]. These behaviours could be changed or exchanged in software, and were often used in rudimentary [[software piracy|anti-piracy]] techniques.\n\n==Modern keyboards==\nOn many modern [[personal computer|PCs]], {{keypress|Pause}} interrupts screen output by [[BIOS]] until another key is pressed. This is effective during [[booting|boot]] in [[text mode]] and in a [[DOS]] box in [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] safe mode with 50 lines. On early keyboards without a {{keypress|Pause}} key (before the introduction of 101/102-key keyboards) the Pause function was assigned to {{keypress|Ctrl|NumLock}}, and the Break function to {{keypress|Ctrl|ScrLock}}; these key-combinations still work with most programs, even on modern PCs with modern keyboards. Pressing the dedicated {{keypress|Pause}} key on 101/102-key keyboards sends the same [[scancode]]s as pressing {{keypress|Ctrl}}, then {{keypress|NumLock}}, then releasing them in the reverse order would do; additionally, an E1<sub>hex</sub> prefix is sent, which enables 101/102-key-aware software to discern the two situations, while older software usually just ignores the prefix. The {{keypress|Pause}} key is different from all other keys in that it sends no scancodes at all on release; therefore it is not possible for any software to determine whether this key is being held down.<ref>{{cite book|title=PS/2 Hardware Interface Technical Reference|date=October 1990|publisher=IBM|url=http://www.mcamafia.de/pdf/ibm_hitrc11.pdf|page=19|chapter=Keyboard 101- and 102-Key|quote=Except for the Pause key, all keys are make/break.}}</ref>\n\nOn modern keyboards, the {{keypress|Break}} key is usually labeled ''Pause'' with ''Break'' below, sometimes separated by a line, or ''Pause'' on the top of the keycap and ''Break'' on the front. In most Windows environments, the key combination {{keypress|Win|Pause}} brings up the system properties.\n\n==Keyboards without Break key==\nCompact and notebook keyboards often do not have a dedicated {{keypress|Pause/Break}} key.\n\nThese may use the following substitutes for {{keypress|Break}}:\n* {{keypress|Ctrl|Fn|F11}} or {{keypress|Fn|B}} or {{keypress|Fn|Ctrl|B}} on certain [[Lenovo]] laptops.<ref>https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/documents/ht074004</ref><ref>http://forum.thinkpads.com/viewtopic.php?f=60&t=98708</ref><ref name=\"thinkpads1\">http://forum.thinkpads.com/viewtopic.php?t=105807</ref>\n* {{keypress|Ctrl|Fn|B}} or {{keypress|Fn|B}} on certain Dell laptops.<ref name=dell>{{Cite web|url=http://cdn.cnetcontent.com/0b/87/0b875d86-4bdc-4b39-a6a0-fe922d9b71a1.pdf#page=18|title=Dell Inspiron 17 specification|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n* {{keypress|Fn|Esc}} on Samsung.\n* {{keypress|Ctrl|Fn|Shift}} on certain HP laptops.\n\nSubstitutes for {{keypress|Pause}}:\n* {{keypress|Fn|P}} or {{keypress|Fn|Ctrl|P}} or {{keypress|Fn|Alt|P}} on certain Lenovo laptops.<ref name=\"thinkpads1\"/>\n* {{keypress|Fn|B}}  on certain Dell laptops.<ref name=\"thinkpads1\"/>\n* {{keypress|Fn|Shift}} on certain HP laptops.\n\n[[Apple keyboard]]s do not have the Pause/Break key,<ref>Computer Hope, Pause key http://www.computerhope.com/jargon/p/pausekey.htm</ref> as [[Mac OS X]] does not use it{{Original research inline|date=September 2016}}.

Another configuration is often used in [[articulated vehicle]]s, which places the bogies (often [[Jacobs bogie]]s) under the connection between the carriages or wagons.\n\nMost bogies have two axles,<ref name=\"how\" /> but some cars designed for heavy loads have more axles per bogie.

A more modern design uses solid rubber springs.\n* [[Brake (railway)|Brake equipment]]: Two main types are used: [[brake shoe]]s that are pressed against the tread of the wheel, and [[Disc brake#Railroad and tram use|disc brakes]] and pads.\n* In powered vehicles, some form of [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]], usually electrically powered [[traction motor]]s or a hydraulically powered [[torque converter]].\n\nThe connections of the bogie with the rail vehicle allow a certain degree of rotational movement around a vertical axis pivot (bolster), with side bearers preventing excessive movement.

The advanced design gave a better ride quality than the BR1, being rated for {{convert|100|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe side frame of the bogie was usually of bar construction, with simple horn guides attached, allowing the axle boxes vertical movements between them.  The axle boxes had a cast-steel equaliser beam or bar resting on them.  The bar had two steel coil springs placed on it and the bogie frame rested on the springs.  The effect was to allow the bar to act as a compensating lever between the two axles and to use both springs to soften shocks from either axle.  The bogie had a conventional bolster suspension with swing links carrying a spring plank.\n\n==== B4 bogie ====\n[[File:Bogie BT4.JPG|thumb|B4 bogie as used on BR Mark 2 and Irish Cravens]]\n\nThe B4 bogie was introduced in 1963.

Some of the B4-fitted Mark 2s, as well as many B4-fitted Mark 1 [[Brake Gangwayed|BGs]] were allowed to run at {{convert|110|mph}} with extra maintenance, particularly of the wheel profile, and more frequent inspection.\n\n==== BT10 bogie ====\n[[File:Bogie BT10.JPG|thumb|BT10 high-speed bogie as used on MK3]]\n\nThe BT10 bogie was introduced on the [[British Rail Mark 3]] coach in the 1970s. Each wheel is separately connected to the bogie by a swing-arm axle.\n\nThere is dual suspension:\n* Primary suspension via a coil spring and damper mounted on each axle\n* Secondary suspension via two air springs mounted on the pivot plank, this is connected to the bogie by pendulum links.  A constant coach height is maintained by air valves.<ref>[http://www.uctc.net/papers/114.pdf ''Roger Barnett'' - British Rail\u2019s InterCity 125 and 225] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529152114/http://www.uctc.net/papers/114.pdf |date=2008-05-29 }}</ref>\n\n==== Locomotives ====\n\n===== Diesel and electric =====\n{{Main article|UIC classification of locomotive axle arrangements|AAR wheel arrangement}}\n\nMost [[diesel locomotive]]s and [[electric locomotive]]s are carried on bogies.

Furthermore, some tramways have steeper gradients and vertical, as well as horizontal, curves, which means tram bogies often need to pivot on the horizontal axis, as well.\n\nSome [[articulated tram]]s have bogies located under articulations, a setup referred to as a [[Jacobs bogie]]. Often, [[low-floor tram]]s are fitted with nonpivoting bogies and many [[tramway enthusiast]]s see this as a retrograde step, as it leads to more wear of both track and wheels and also significantly reduces the speed at which a tram can round a curve.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.railway2007.fd.cvut.cz/proceedings/Capek+Kolar.pdf |title=\u010cVUT.cz - \u010capek, Kol\u00e1\u0159 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-05-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718170646/http://www.railway2007.fd.cvut.cz/proceedings/Capek+Kolar.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-18 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==== Historic ====\nIn the past, many different types of bogie (truck) have been used under tramcars (e.g. [[J. G. Brill and Company|Brill]], Peckham, maximum traction).  A maximum traction truck has one driving axle with large wheels and one nondriving axle with smaller wheels.  The bogie pivot is located off-centre, so more than half the weight rests on the driving axle.\n\n[[File:Crich-Bogie-wyrdlight-812322.jpg|thumb|upright|Workers maintaining an electro-mechanical bogie from a tram at [[National Tramway Museum|Crich Tramway Village]]]]\n\n=== Hybrid systems ===\n[[File:Bogie-metro-Meteor-p1010692.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mockup]] of the pneumatic bogie system of a [[MP 89]] carriage used on the [[Paris M\u00e9tro Line 14|''Meteor'' metro]], showing the two [[Wheelset (rail transport)#Special wheelsets|special wheelsets]]]]\nThe retractable stadium roof on Toronto's [[Rogers Centre]] used modified off-the-shelf train bogies on a circular rail. The system was chosen for its proven reliability.\n\n[[Rubber-tyred metro]] trains use a specialised version of railway bogies. Special flanged steel wheels are behind the rubber-tired running wheels, with additional horizontal guide wheels in front of and behind the running wheels, as well. The unusually large flanges on the steel wheels guide the bogie through standard [[railroad switch]]es, and in addition keep the train from [[derailment|derailing]] in case the tires deflate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.infovisual.info/05/050_en.html|title=Truck (bogie) - Visual Dictionary|first=Bernard|last=Dery|date=|website=www.infovisual.info|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160616154008/http://infovisual.info/05/050_en.html|archivedate=16 June 2016|df=}}</ref>\n\n=== Variable gauge axles ===\nTo overcome [[break of gauge|breaks of gauge]] some bogies are being fitted with [[variable gauge]] axles (VGA) so that they can operate on two different gauges.  These include the [[SUW 2000]] system from [[ZNTK Pozna\u0144]].\n\n=== Cleminson system ===\nThe Cleminson system is not a true bogie, but serves a similar purpose. It was based on a patent of 1883 by James Cleminson,<ref>http://www.icevirtuallibrary.com/docserver/fulltext/imotp.1897.19461.pdf?expires=1315520526&id=id&accname=guest&checksum=AD521ED02561C3CF38D1772ECF1ACA2B {{dead link|date=November 2012}}</ref> and was once popular on narrow-gauge rolling stock, e.g. on the [[Isle of Man Railway rolling stock|Isle of Man]] and [[Manx Northern Railway]]s.  The vehicle would have three axles and the outer two could pivot to adapt to curvature of the track.  The pivoting was controlled by levers attached to the third (centre) axle, which could slide sideways.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.festipedia.org.uk/wiki/Cleminson_Flexible_Six-Wheeled_Waggon|title=Cleminson flexible six-wheeled waggon - Festipedia|author=|date=|website=www.festipedia.org.uk|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160317160428/https://www.festipedia.org.uk/wiki/Cleminson_Flexible_Six-Wheeled_Waggon|archivedate=17 March 2016|df=}}</ref>\n\n== Tracked vehicles ==\nSome [[tank]]s and other [[Caterpillar track|tracked]] vehicles have bogies as external suspension components (see [[suspension (vehicle)#Armoured fighting vehicle suspension|armoured fighting vehicle suspension]]). This type of bogie usually has two or more road wheels and some type of sprung suspension to smooth the ride across rough terrain. Bogie suspensions keep much of their components on the outside of the vehicle, saving internal space. Although vulnerable to [[antitank]] fire, they can often be repaired or replaced in the field.\n\n== Articulated bogie ==\nAn '''articulated bogie''' is any one of a number of bogie designs that allow [[railway]] equipment to safely turn sharp corners, while reducing or eliminating the \"screeching\" normally associated with metal wheels rounding a bend in the rails. There are a number of such designs, and the term is also applied to train sets that incorporate articulation in the vehicle, as opposed to the bogies themselves.\n\nIf one considers a single bogie \"up close\", it resembles a small rail car with axles at either end. The same effect that causes the bogies to rub against the rails at longer radius causes each of the pairs of wheels to rub on the rails and cause the screeching. Articulated bogies add a second pivot point between the two axles to allow them to rotate to the correct angle even in these cases.\n\n== Articulated lorries (tractor-trailers) ==\n<!-- This section has absolutely nothing to do with [[locomotives]] or other [[railroad car]]s and no such article should be redirected to this section -->\nIn [[Road transport#Trucking and hauling|trucking]], a bogie is the subassembly of axles and wheels that supports a [[semi-trailer]], whether permanently attached to the frame (as on a single trailer) or making up the [[dolly (trailer)|dolly]] that can be hitched and unhitched as needed when hitching up a second or third semi-trailer (as when [[semi-trailer|pulling doubles]] or [[road train|triples]]).\n\n== Bogie (aircraft) ==\n{{Main|Landing gear}}\n[[File:Boeing-777-300 chassis .jpg|thumb|upright=1.14|Main landing gear leg and six-wheel '''bogie''' of a [[Boeing 777|Boeing 777-300]]]]\n{{clear}}\n\n== Image gallery ==\n<gallery class=\"center\" style=\"font-size:92%; line-height:130%\" widths=160 heights=140>\nFile:Journal box.png |A [[journal box]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Railroad Dictionary: J |url=http://www.csx.com/index.cfm/about-csx/company-overview/railroad-dictionary/?i=J |publisher=CSX Corporation |website=CSX.com |year=2012 |accessdate=15 November 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729221255/http://www.csx.com/index.cfm/about-csx/company-overview/railroad-dictionary/?i=J |archivedate=29 July 2014 |df= }}</ref> Journal boxes are no longer used on North American railways.<ref name=\"col\">{{Cite web|title=AAR M-1003 Certified Truck Component Manufacturing|url=http://www.columbuscastings.com/bolster_frames.html|website=ColumbusCastings.com|publisher=Columbus Castings|location=Columbus, Ohio|accessdate=19 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019033202/http://www.columbuscastings.com/bolster_frames.html|archivedate=2014-10-19|df=}}</ref><ref name=\"SCT\">{{Cite web|title=General Information |url=http://www.sctco.com/pdf/sect_1.pdf |website=SCTCO.com |publisher=Standard Car Truck Company |format=PDF |date=January 2000 |accessdate=19 November 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304045504/http://www.sctco.com/pdf/sect_1.pdf |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df= }}</ref>\nFile:Railroad truck, FM55-20.Fig8-8.png |A US-style railroad truck with [[journal bearing]]s in [[journal box]]es<ref name=\"col\" /><ref name=\"SCT\" />\nFile:Bettendorf truck at Illinois Railway Museum.JPG | [[William P.

It originated from the [[nationalization|nationalised]] '''British Steel Corporation''' ('''BSC'''), formed in 1967, which was privatised as a public limited company, British Steel plc, in 1988. It was once a constituent of the [[FTSE 100 Index]]. The company merged with [[Koninklijke Hoogovens]] to form [[Corus Group]] in 1999.\n\n== History ==\nAlasdair M. Blair (1997), Professor of International Relations and Head of the Department of Politics and Public Policy at De Montfort University, has explored the history of British Steel since the Second World War to evaluate the impact of government intervention in a market economy. He suggests that entrepreneurship was lacking in the 1940s; the government could not persuade the industry to upgrade its plants. For generations the industry had followed a piecemeal growth pattern that proved inefficient in the face of world competition. The [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] came to power in 1945, committed to [[socialism]]. In 1946, it put the first steel development plan into practice with the aim of increasing capacity. It passed the [[Iron and Steel Corporation of Great Britain|Iron and Steel Act 1949]], which meant nationalisation of the industry, as the government bought out the shareholders, and created the [[Iron and Steel Corporation of Great Britain]]. American [[Marshall Plan]] aid in 1948\u201350 reinforced modernisation efforts and provided funding for them. However, the nationalisation was reversed by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government after 1952.\n\nThe industry was again nationalised in 1967 under another Labour government, becoming British Steel Corporation (BSC). But by then, 20 years of political manipulation had left companies, such as British Steel, with serious problems: a complacency with existing equipment, plants operating below full capacity (hence the low efficiency), poor-quality assets, outdated technology, government price controls, higher coal and oil costs, lack of funds for capital improvement, and increasing competition in the world market.\n\nBy the 1970s the Labour government's main goal for the declining industry was to keep employment high. Since British Steel was a major employer in depressed regions, it was decided to keep many mills and facilities operating at a loss. In the 1980s, Conservative Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] re-privatised BSC as British Steel. Under private control, the company dramatically cut its work force and underwent a radical reorganisation and massive capital investment to again become competitive in the world marketplace.<ref>Alasdair M. Blair, \"The British iron and steel industry since 1945,\" ''Journal of European Economic History'' (1997) 26#3 pp 571\u201381</ref>\n\n=== Nationalisation ===\nBSC was formed from the assets of former private companies which had been nationalised, largely under the Labour government of [[Harold Wilson]], on 28 July 1967.<ref name=\"google\">{{cite book|title=The Politics of Steel: Western Europe and the Steel Industry in the Crisis Years (1974\u20131984)|author1=M\u00e9ny, Y.|author2=Wright, V.|author3=Rhodes, M.|date=1987|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=9783110105179|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eYZinsF8qEAC|page=315|accessdate=5 October 2014}}</ref> Wilson's was the second attempt at nationalisation, [[Clement Attlee]]'s [[Iron and Steel Corporation of Great Britain]] having been largely privatised by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] governments of the 1950s.  Only one steel company, [[Richard Thomas and Baldwins]], remained in public ownership throughout.\n\nBSC was established under the [[Iron and Steel Act 1967]], which vested in the Corporation the shares of the fourteen major UK-based steel companies then in operation, being:\n*[[David Colville & Sons]];\n*[[Consett Iron Company]] Ltd;\n*[[Dorman Long]] & Company Ltd;\n*[[English Steel Corporation]] Ltd;\n*[[GKN]] Steel Company Ltd;\n*[[John Summers & Sons]] Ltd;\n*[[Lancashire Steel Corporation|The Lancashire Steel Corporation Ltd]];\n*[[Park Gate Iron and Steel Company|The Park Gate Iron and Steel Company Ltd]];\n*[[Richard Thomas and Baldwins]] Ltd;\n*[[Round Oak Steelworks]] Ltd;\n*South Durham Steel & Iron Company Ltd;\n*[[Steel Company of Wales|The Steel Company of Wales Ltd]];\n*[[Stewarts & Lloyds]], Ltd; and\n*[[United Steel Companies|The United Steel Companies Ltd]].\n\nAt the time of its formation, BSC comprised around ninety percent of the UK's steelmaking capacity; it had around 268,500 employees and around 200 wholly  or partly owned subsidiaries based in the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Africa, South Asia, and South America.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uksteel.org.uk/keydates.htm |title=UK Steel:Key dates|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080124014508/http://www.uksteel.org.uk/keydates.htm |archivedate=24 January 2008 |accessdate=23 February 2008}}</ref>\n\nDorman Long, South Durham and Stewarts and Lloyds had merged as British Steel and Tube Ltd before vesting took place. BSC later arranged an exchange deal with [[Guest, Keen and Nettlefolds]] Ltd (GKN), the parent company of GKN Steel, under which BSC acquired [[Dowlais Ironworks]] at [[Merthyr Tydfil]] and GKN took over BSC's [[Brymbo Steelworks]] near [[Wrexham]].\n\n=== Restructuring ===\nAccording to Blair (1997), British Steel faced serious problems at the time of its formation, including obsolescent plants; plants operating under capacity and thus at low efficiency; outdated technology; price controls that reduced marketing flexibility; soaring coal and oil costs; lack of capital investment funds; and increasing competition on the world market. By the 1970s, the government adopted a policy of keeping employment artificially high in the declining industry. This especially impacted BSC since it was a major employer in a number of depressed regions.<ref>Alasdair M. Blair, \"The British iron and steel industry since 1945,\" Journal of European Economic History Winter 1997, Vol. 26 Issue 3, pp 571\u201381</ref>\n\nOne of the arguments aired in favour of nationalisation was that it would enable steel production to be rationalised. This involved concentrating investment on major integrated plants, placed near the coast for ease of access by sea, and closing older, smaller plants, especially those that had been located inland for proximity to coal supplies.\n\nFrom the mid-1970s the (now loss-making) British Steel, pursued a strategy of concentrating steelmaking in five areas: South Wales, [[South Yorkshire]], [[Scunthorpe]], [[Teesside]] and [[Scotland]]. This policy continued following the Conservative victory in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|1979 general election]]. Other traditional steelmaking areas faced cutbacks. Under the Labour government of [[James Callaghan]], a review by Lord Beswick had led to the reprieve of the so-called 'Beswick plants', for social reasons, but subsequent governments were obliged under EU rules to withdraw subsidies. Major changes resulted across Europe, including in the UK:\n\n* At [[Consett]] the closure of the British Steel works in 1980 marked the end of steel production in [[River Derwent, North East England|Derwent Valley]] and the sharp decline of the area.\n* At [[Corby]], the closure of the former Stewarts & Lloyds site in the early 1980s saw the loss of 11,000 jobs, leading to an initial unemployment rate of over 30%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm200102/cmselect/cmtlgr/603/603ap33.htm |title=Select Committee on Transport, Local Government and the Regions|publisher= HMSO|accessdate=23 February 2008}}</ref>\n* In Wales, works at East Moors (Cardiff) closed\n* In Scotland, Western Europe's largest hot [[strip steel]] mill [[Ravenscraig steelworks]], near [[Motherwell]], [[North Lanarkshire]], was closed by British Steel in 1992, leading to huge unemployment in the area. It also led to the closure of several local support and satellite businesses, such as the nearby British Steel [[Clydesdale Works]] in [[Mossend]], [[Clyde Alloy]] in [[Netherton, North Lanarkshire|Netherton]] and equipment maker [[Anderson Strathclyde]]. Demolition of the site's landmark blue gasometer in 1996, and the subsequent cleanup operation, has created the largest [[brownfield land|brownfield site]] in [[Europe]]. This huge area between Motherwell and [[Wishaw]] is in line to be transformed into the new town of [[Ravenscraig]], a project partly funded by [[Tata Steel Europe|Corus]].\n\n=== Privatisation ===\nBritish Steel was [[privatization|privatised]] in 1988 by the Conservative government of [[Margaret Thatcher]].

In 1912, the [[General Post Office]], a government department, became the monopoly telecoms supplier in the United Kingdom. The Post Office Act of 1969 led to the GPO becoming a public corporation. British Telecommunications, trading as ''British Telecom'', was formed in 1980, and became independent of the Post Office in 1981. British Telecommunications was privatised in 1984, becoming ''British Telecommunications plc'', with some 50 percent of its shares sold to investors. The Government sold its remaining stake in further share sales in 1991 and 1993.

As these companies amalgamated and were taken over or collapsed, the remaining companies were transferred to [[Government-owned corporation|state control]] under the [[General Post Office|Post Office]] in 1912. These companies were merged and [[Rebranding|rebranded]] as British Telecom.<ref name=\"BT History\">{{cite web | url = http://www.btplc.com/Thegroup/BTsHistory/ | title = The historical development of BT | year = 2010 | accessdate =12 June 2010 | publisher=BT Group| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100527143141/http://www.btplc.com/Thegroup/BTsHistory/History.htm| archivedate= 27 May 2010 | deadurl= no}}</ref>\n\n===1878 to 1969===\n[[File:BT Tower-1.jpg|thumb|right|The [[BT Tower]], originally the Post Office Tower, completed 1964]]\nIn  1878 [[Alexander Graham Bell]] demonstrated his recently developed telephone to [[Queen Victoria]] at [[Osborne House]] on the [[Isle of Wight]].<ref name=\"Linge\">{{cite news|title=First helped put us in touch 135 years ago|last=Linge|first=Prof. Nigel|date=4 February 2013|work=Manchester Evening News|publisher=MEN Media|page=9}}</ref> A few days later the first telephone in Britain was installed, under licence from the General Post Office, by engineers from David Moseley and Sons,{{explain|date=September 2018}} to connect the [[Manchester]] premises of  hardware merchant John Hudson with his other premises in nearby [[Shudehill]].<ref name=\"Linge\" />  The first telephone exchange,<!--the first in the world, or in Britain?--> allowing any of an area's phones to be connected with any other, was opened in London in August 1879, soon followed by one in Manchester.<ref name=\"Linge\" /> From 1878 on, telephone service in Britain was provided by private companies such as the [[National Telephone Company]]. In 1896, the National Telephone Company was taken over by the General Post Office. In 1912 it became the primary supplier of telecommunications services, after the Post Office took over the private telephone service in Britain, except for a few local authority services.<ref name=\"BT History\" />\n\n====Public corporation====\nConverting the Post Office into a nationalised industry, as opposed to a governmental department, was first discussed in 1932; a report on the subject{{explain|date=September 2018}} that year was rejected.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.btplc.com/thegroup/btshistory/1912to1968/1932.htm|title=1912to1968|publisher=}}</ref> In 1961, more proposals were ignored. <ref name=\"BT History\" />\n\nOn 1 October 1969, under the Post Office Act of 1969, the Post Office ceased to be a government department and it became established as a [[Public company|public corporation]]. The Act gave the Post Office the exclusive privilege of operating telecommunications systems with listed powers to authorise others to run such systems. Effectively, the General Post Office retained its telecommunications monopoly.<ref name=\"BT History\" />\n\n===1970 to 1990===\n[[File:British Telecom 1981.svg|thumb|150px|Logo used from 1980 to 1991]]\nIn 1977, the Carter Committee Report recommended a further division of the two main services and for their relocation under two individual corporations. The findings contained in the report led to the renaming of [[Post Office Telecommunications]] as British Telecommunications (trading as British Telecom) in 1980, although it remained part of the Post Office.<ref name=\"BT History\" />\n\nThe [[British Telecommunications Act 1981]] transferred the responsibility for telecommunications services from the Post Office, creating two separate corporations, [[Post Office Ltd]] and British Telecommunications. At this time the first steps were taken to introduce competition into British telecommunications industry. In particular, the Act empowered the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, as well as British Telecommunications, to license other operators to run public telecommunications systems. Additionally, a framework was established which enabled the Secretary of State to set standards with the [[British Standards Institution]] (BSI) for apparatus supplied to the public by third parties, and had the effect of requiring British Telecommunications to connect approved apparatus to its systems. The Secretary of State made use of these new powers and began the process of opening up the apparatus supply market, where a phased programme of liberalisation was started in 1981. In 1982, a licence was granted to Cable & Wireless to run a public telecommunications network through its subsidiary, [[Mercury Communications Ltd]].<ref name=\"BT History\" /><ref>[http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/mercury-communications-ltd-history/ History of Mercury Communications] fundinguniverse.com</ref>\n\nOn 19 July 1982, the Government formally announced its intention to privatise British Telecommunications with the sale of up to 51% of the company's shares to private investors. This intention was confirmed by the passing of the [[Telecommunications Act 1984]], which received Royal Assent on 12 April that year. The transfer to British Telecommunications plc of the business of British Telecommunications, the statutory corporation, took place on 6 August 1984 and, on 20 November 1984, more than 50 per cent of British Telecommunications shares were sold to the public. At the time, this was the largest share issue in the world.<ref>[https://www.expressandstar.com/days/1976-2000/1984.html Tory conference bombed] ''Express and Sta''r. Retrieved 24 March 2012</ref>\n\nThe new legislation was intended to enable British Telecommunications to become more responsive to competition in GB and to expand its operations globally. Commercial freedom granted to British Telecommunications allowed it to enter into new joint ventures and, if it so decided, to engage in the manufacture of its own apparatus. The company's transfer into the private sector continued in December 1991 when the Government sold around half its remaining holding of 47.6% of shares, reducing its stake to 21.8%. Substantially all the government's remaining shares were sold in a third flotation in July 1993, raising \u00a35&nbsp;billion for the Treasury and introducing 750,000 new shareholders to the company.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/investing/8898538/Privatisation-shares-how-have-they-fared.html Privatisation shares \u2013 how have they fared?] ''The Daily Telegraph'' (London), 18 November 2011</ref>\n\nThe 1984 Act also abolished British Telecommunications's exclusive privilege of running telecommunications systems and established a framework to safeguard the workings of competition. This meant that British Telecommunications finally lost its monopoly in running telecommunications systems, which it had technically retained under the 1981 Act despite the Secretary of State's licensing powers. It now required a licence in the same way as any other telecommunications operator. The principal licence granted to British Telecommunications laid down strict and extensive conditions affecting the range of its activities, including those of manufacture and supply of apparatus.<ref name=\"BT History\" />\n\nIn 1985, [[Cellnet]] was launched as a subsidiary of Telecom Securicor Cellular Radio Limited, a 60:40 venture between British Telecommunications and [[G4S|Securicor]] respectively. Securicor originally invested \u00a34&nbsp;million in Cellnet in 1983. In 1999, BT purchased Securicor's shares in Cellnet for \u00a33.15&nbsp;billion. The company was later rebranded as BT Cellnet, and became a part of BT Wireless, a group of subsidiary companies owned by BT.<ref>{{Cite news | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/404792.stm | title= BT gobbles up Cellnet | date= 27 July 1999 | accessdate =1 May 2010 |publisher=BBC News}}</ref>\n\nThe next major development for British Telecommunications, and a move towards a more open market in telecommunications, occurred in 1991. On 5 March, the Government's [[White Paper]], \"Competition and Choice: Telecommunications Policy\" for the 1990s, was issued. In effect, it ended the duopoly which had been shared by British Telecommunications and [[Mercury Communications]] in the UK since November 1983 and the build-up to privatisation. The new policy enabled customers to acquire telecommunications services from competing providers using a variety of technologies. Independent \"retail\" companies were permitted to bulk-buy telecommunications capacity and sell it in packages to business and domestic users. The White Paper was endorsed by British Telecommunications, the new policy enabling the company to compete freely and more effectively by offering flexible pricing packages to meet the needs of different types of customer.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/030859619190039E|title=Competition and choice in telecommunications: The Duopoly review consultative document|accessdate=15 March 2015 | doi=10.1016/0308-5961(91)90039-E|volume=15|journal=Telecommunications Policy|pages=10\u201314}}</ref>\n\n===1991 to 2006===\n[[File:BT old logo.svg|thumb|150px|The BT brand and piper logo were introduced in 1991.

This alliance gave BT and MCI a global network for providing end-to-end connectivity for advanced business services. Concert was the first company to provide a single-source broad portfolio of global communications services for multinational customers. On 3 November 1996, BT and MCI announced they had entered into a merger agreement to create a global telecommunications company called Concert plc, to be incorporated in GB, with headquarters in both [[London]] and [[Washington, D.C.]] As part of the alliance BT acquired a 20% holding in MCI. Nevertheless, following US carrier [[WorldCom]]'s rival bid for MCI on 1 October 1997, BT ultimately decided in November, to sell its stake in MCI to WorldCom for $7&nbsp;billion. The deal with WorldCom resulted in a profit of more than $2&nbsp;billion on BT's original investment in MCI, with an additional $465&nbsp;million severance fee for the break-up of the proposed merger.<ref name=\"BT History\" />\n\nIn December 2000, following modifications to BT's licence in April 2000, BT offered [[local loop unbundling]] (LLU) to other telecommunications operators, enabling them to use BT's copper local loops (the connection between the customer's premises and the exchange) to connect directly with their customers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.silverlinings.eu/voice/telephone-lines/local-loop-unbundling/|title=Local loop unbundling|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030101249/http://www.silverlinings.eu/voice/telephone-lines/local-loop-unbundling/|archivedate=30 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[File:British Telecom offices in Madrid (Spain) 01.jpg|thumb|BT offices in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]]]]\nFollowing the [[dot com crash]], the group undertook a board restructuring and asset sale to address its large debts.

It also introduced a new regulatory framework. The licensing regime was replaced by a general authorisation for companies to provide telecommunications services subject to general conditions of entitlement and, in some instances, specific conditions.

The USO included connecting consumers to the fixed telephone network, schemes for consumers with special social needs, and the provision of call box services.<ref name=\"BT History\" />\n\nIn the summer of 2004, BT launched Consult 21, an industry consultation for BT's 21st century network (21CN) programme.

On learning of the commission, [[William Burn]] sought an interview with the prince, apparently to complain that Smith previously had plagiarised his work, however, Burn was unsuccessful in depriving Smith of the appointment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottisharchitects.org.uk/architect_full.php?id=201859 |title=William Smith II |work=Dictionary of Scottish Architects 1840\u20131980 |accessdate=23 January 2012}}</ref> William Smith's designs were amended by Prince Albert, who took a close interest in details such as turrets and windows.<ref>Millar, p.57</ref>\n\n[[File:balmoral by queen.JPG|thumb|right|220px|''Balmoral Castle'', painted by Queen Victoria in 1854 during its construction]]\n\nConstruction began during summer 1853, on a site some {{convert|100|yd}} northwest of the original building that was considered to have a better vista.<ref>Millar, pp.56\u201357</ref> Another reason for consideration was, that whilst construction was ongoing, the family would still be able to use the old house.<ref name=Balmoral/>{{rp|9}} Queen Victoria laid the foundation stone on 28 September 1853, during her annual autumn visit.<ref>Millar, p.58</ref> By the autumn of 1855, the royal apartments were ready for occupancy, although the tower was still under construction and the servants had to be lodged in the old house.<ref name=\"Millar, p.59\"/> By coincidence, shortly after their arrival at the estate that autumn, news circulated about the fall of [[Siege of Sevastopol (1854\u201355)|Sevastopol]], ending the Crimean War, resulting in wild celebrations by royalty and locals alike. While visiting the estate shortly thereafter, [[Frederick III, German Emperor|Prince Frederick of Prussia]] asked for the hand of [[Victoria, Princess Royal|Princess Victoria]].<ref name=Balmoral/>{{rp|11}}\n\n[[File:Queen Victoria Prince Albert and their nine children.JPG|alt=Photograph of a seated Victoria, dressed in black, holding an infant with her children and Prince Albert standing around her|thumb|With their nine children, 1857 - ''left to right'': Alice, Arthur, Prince Albert, Edward, Leopold, Louise, Queen Victoria holding Beatrice, Alfred, Victoria, and Helena]]\n\nThe new house was completed in 1856, and the old castle subsequently was demolished.<ref name=garden/> By autumn 1857, a new bridge across the Dee, designed by [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]] linking Crathie and Balmoral was finished.<ref name=Balmoral/>{{rp|11}}\n\nBalmoral Castle is built from [[granite]] quarried at Invergelder on the estate,<ref>{{cite book |title=Scotland's Gardens |author=Little, G.

They decorated Balmoral with tartans and attended [[highland games]] at Braemar. Queen Victoria expressed an affinity for Scotland, even professing herself to be a [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Devine, T.M. |title=The Scottish Nation 1700\u20132000 |publisher=Penguin |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-14-102769-2}}</ref> Added to the work of [[Sir Walter Scott]], this became a major factor in promoting the adoption of [[Highland culture]] by [[Lowland Scotland|Lowland Scots]].

Victoria took long walks of up to four hours daily and Albert spent many days hunting deer and game. In 1849, diarist [[Charles Greville (diarist)|Charles Greville]] described their life at Balmoral as resembling that of gentry rather than royalty.<ref>Millar, p.44</ref> Victoria began a policy of commissioning artists to record Balmoral, its surroundings, and its staff. Over the years, numerous painters were employed at Balmoral, including [[Edwin Landseer|Edwin]] and [[Charles Landseer]], [[Carl Haag]], [[William Wyld]], and [[William Henry Fisk]].<ref>Millar, ''passim''</ref> The royal couple took great interest in their staff. They established a lending library.\n\nDuring the 1850s, new plantations were established near the house and exotic conifers were planted on the grounds. Prince Albert had an active role in these improvements, overseeing the design of [[parterre]]s, the diversion of the main road north of the river via a new bridge, and plans for farm buildings.<ref name=garden/> These buildings included a [[model farm|model dairy]] that he developed during 1861, the year of his death. The dairy was completed by Victoria. Subsequently, she also built several monuments to her husband on the estate. These include a pyramid-shaped cairn built a year after Albert's death, on top of ''Craig Lurachain''. A large statue of Albert with a dog and a gun by [[William Theed]], was inaugurated on 15 October 1867, the twenty-eighth anniversary of their engagement.<ref name=\"Balmoral\">{{cite book|last=MacLean|first=Charles|title=Balmoral Highland Estate|publisher=Balmoral Castle and Estate|year=|isbn=}}</ref>{{rp|20\u201321}}<ref>Millar, p.102</ref>\n\n[[File:Cairn for Prince Albert Balmoral.JPG|thumb|right|220px|Memorial cairn for Prince Albert, Balmoral Estate]]\n\nFollowing Albert's death, Victoria spent increasing periods at Balmoral, staying for as long as four months a year during early summer and autumn. Few further changes were made to the grounds, with the exception of some alterations to mountain paths, the erection of various cairns and monuments, and the addition of some cottages (''Karim Cottage'' and ''Baile na Coille'') built for senior staff.<ref name=garden/><ref name=Balmoral/>{{rp|18}} It was during this period that Victoria began to depend on her servant, [[John Brown (servant)|John Brown]]. He was a local [[wikt:gillie|ghillie]] from Crathie, who became one of her closest companions during her long mourning.<ref name=Balmoral/>{{rp|23}}\n\nIn 1887, Balmoral Castle was the birthplace of [[Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg|Victoria Eugenie]], a granddaughter of Queen Victoria. She was born to [[Princess Beatrice of the United Kingdom|Princess Beatrice]], the fifth daughter of Victoria and Albert. Victoria Eugenie would become the queen of Spain.\n\nIn September 1896, Victoria welcomed [[Nicholas II of Russia|Emperor Nicholas II of Russia]] and [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|Empress Alexandra]] to Balmoral. Four years later Victoria made her last visit to the estate, three months before her death on 22 January 1901.\n\n===After Victoria===\n\n[[File:EdwardVII at Balmoral.jpg|175px|left|thumbnail|right|''[[Edward VII]] relaxing at Balmoral Castle'' - photograph by his wife, Alexandra, c. 1907-1908]]\n\nAfter Victoria's death, the royal family continued to use Balmoral during annual autumn visits. [[George V]] had substantial improvements made during the 1910s and 1920s, including formal gardens to the south of the castle.<ref name=garden/>\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]], royal visits to Balmoral ceased. In addition, due to the enmity with Germany, ''Danzig Shiel'', a lodge built by Victoria in Ballochbuie was renamed ''Garbh Allt Shiel'' and the \"King of Prussia's Fountain\" was removed from the grounds.<ref name=Balmoral/>{{rp|25}}\n\nSince the 1950s, [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]] has added herbaceous borders and a water garden. During the 1980s new staff buildings were built close to the castle.<ref name=garden/>\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:Balmoral Castle porte cochere.jpg|150px|thumb|The \"battlemented\" [[porte coch\u00e8re]].

The seven-storey tower is an architectural feature borrowed from medieval defensive [[tower house]]s. The \"pepper pot\" turrets were influenced by the style of 16th-century French [[ch\u00e2teau]]x. Other features of the Scottish Baronial style are the [[crow-stepped gable]]s, [[dormer]] windows, and [[battlement]]ed [[porte-coch\u00e8re]].<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group| isbn = 978-0-313-31850-4| last = Jones| first = Nigel R.| title = Architecture of England, Scotland, and Wales| date = 2005}}</ref>\n\n==Ownership==\nBalmoral is a private property and, unlike the monarch's [[official residence]]s, is not the property of [[the Crown]]. It originally was purchased personally by Prince Albert, rather than the queen, meaning that no revenues from the estate go to Parliament or to the public purse, as would otherwise be the case for property owned outright by the monarch in accord with the [[Civil List Act 1760]].<ref name=\"Wightman\" /> Along with [[Sandringham House]] in Norfolk, ownership of Balmoral was inherited by [[Edward VIII]] on his accession in 1936. When he [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|abdicated]] later the same year, however, he retained ownership of them. A financial settlement was devised, under which Balmoral and Sandringham were purchased by Edward's brother and successor to the Crown, [[George VI]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/TheRoyalResidences/SandringhamHouse/History.aspx |title=Sandringham House: History |work=The official website of The British Monarchy |publisher=The Royal Household |accessdate=12 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100416104935/http://www.royal.gov.uk/TheRoyalResidences/SandringhamHouse/History.aspx |archive-date=2010-04-16|dead-url=yes}}</ref>\n\nCurrently, the estate is still owned outright by the monarch, but, by Trustees under Deeds of Nomination and Appointment, it is managed by a trust.<ref name=Wightman>{{cite book|last=Wightman|first=Andy|title=The Poor Had No Lawyers|year=2011|publisher=Birlinn|location=Edinburgh|page=113}}</ref>\n\n==The estate==\n\n===Current extent and operation===\n\nBalmoral Estate is within the [[Cairngorms National Park]] and is partly within the Deeside and Lochnagar [[National Scenic Area (Scotland)|National Scenic Area]].<ref name=cons>{{cite web |url=http://www.balmoralcastle.com/conservation.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120805162711/http://www.balmoralcastle.com/conservation.htm|archivedate=2012-08-05|title=Conservation |publisher=Balmoral Estates (archived at web.archive.org|accessdate=18 June 2014}}</ref> The {{convert|50,000|acre|adj=on}} estate contains a wide variety of landscapes, from the [[River Dee, Aberdeenshire|Dee river valley]] to open mountains.

Breton is most closely related to [[Cornish language|Cornish]], both being [[Southwestern Brittonic languages]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Breton-language|title=Breton language|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-09-18}}</ref> [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and the extinct [[Cumbric language|Cumbric]] are the more distantly related [[Western Brittonic languages]].\n\nThe other [[regional language]] of Brittany, [[Gallo language|Gallo]], is a [[Langues d'o\u00efl|langue d'o\u00efl]]. Gallo is consequently close to French, although not mutually intelligible, and a [[Romance languages|Romance language]] descended from [[Latin]] (unlike the similarly named ancient Celtic language [[Gaulish language|Gaulish]]).\n\nHaving declined from more than 1 million speakers around 1950 to about 200,000 in the first decade of the 21st century, Breton is classified as \"severely endangered\" by the UNESCO [[Red Book of Endangered Languages|Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger]]. However, the number of children attending bilingual classes has risen 33% between 2006 and 2012 to 14,709.<ref name=\"Broudic2009\"/><ref name=\"ofis-stats\"/>\n\n==History and status==\n{{see also|Linguistic boundary of Brittany}}\nBreton is spoken in [[Lower Brittany]] ({{lang-br|Breizh-Izel}}), roughly to the west of a line linking [[Plouha]] (west of [[Saint-Brieuc]]) and [[La Roche-Bernard]] (east of [[Vannes]]). It comes from a Brittonic language community that once extended from Great Britain to [[Armorica]] (present-day Brittany) and had even established a toehold in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] (in present-day Spain). Old Breton is attested from the 9th century. It was the language of the upper classes until the 12th century, after which it became the language of commoners in Lower Brittany. The nobility, followed by the [[bourgeoisie]], adopted [[French language|French]]. The written language of the [[Duchy of Brittany]] was [[Latin]], switching to French in the 15th century. There exists a limited tradition of [[Breton literature]]. Some Old Breton vocabulary remains in the present day as [[Philosophy|philosophical]] and scientific terms in Modern Breton. The recognized stages of the Breton language are: '''Old Breton''' - c.800 to c.1100, '''Middle Breton''' - c.1100 to c.1650, '''Modern Breton''' - c.1650 to present.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia |last=Koch |first=John T. |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2006 |location=Santa Barbara, Califfornia |oclc=62381207}}</ref>\n\nThe French monarchy was not concerned with the [[Minority language|minority]] [[languages of France]] spoken by the lower classes, and required the use of French for government business as part of its policy of national unity. During the [[French Revolution]], the government introduced policies favouring French over the regional languages, which it pejoratively referred to as {{lang|fr|[[patois]]}}. The revolutionaries assumed that [[reactionary]] and [[monarchy|monarchist]] forces preferred [[regional language]]s to try to keep the peasant masses underinformed. In 1794, [[Bertrand Bar\u00e8re]] submitted his \"report on the {{lang|fr|patois}}\" to the [[Committee of Public Safety]] in which he said that \"federalism and superstition speak Breton\".<ref name=\"breizh\"/>\n\nSince the 19th century, under the [[French Third Republic|Third]], [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth]] and [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republics]], the government has attempted to stamp out minority languages, including Breton, in state schools, in an effort to build a national culture. Teachers humiliated students for using their regional languages, and such practices prevailed until the late 1960s.<ref name=\"breizh\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.breizh.net/icdbl/saozg/endangered.htm#Image%2520No.%25202:%2520Breton%2520is%2520a%2520hindrance%2520to%2520good%2520citizenship |title=Breton \u2013 An Endangered Language of Europe |last=Kuter |first=Lois  |date=May 2004 |website=breizh.net}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 21st century, due to the political centralization of France, the influence of the media, and the increasing mobility of people, only about 200,000 people can speak Breton, a dramatic decline from more than a million in 1950. The majority of today's speakers are more than 60 years old, and Breton is now classified as an [[endangered language]].<ref name=\"Broudic2009\" />\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, half of the population of Lower Brittany knew only Breton; the other half were bilingual. By 1950, there were only 100,000 [[monolingualism|monolingual]] Bretons, and this rapid decline has continued, with likely no monolingual speakers left today. A statistical survey in 1997 found around 300,000 speakers in Lower Brittany, of whom about 190,000 were aged 60 or older. Few 15- to 19-year-olds spoke Breton.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Qui parle breton aujourd'hui?

Edited by Jehan Lagadec in 1464, it was a trilingual work containing Breton, French and Latin. Today bilingual dictionaries have been published for Breton and languages including English, Dutch, German, Spanish and Welsh. A new generation{{clarify|date=March 2016}} is determined to gain international recognition for Breton. The monolingual dictionary, {{lang|br|Geriadur Brezhoneg an Here}} (1995), defines Breton words in Breton. The first edition contained about 10,000 words, and the second edition of 2001 contains 20,000 words.\n\nIn the early 21st century, the {{lang|br|[[Ofis ar Brezhoneg]]}} (\"Office of the Breton language\") began a campaign to encourage daily use of Breton in the region by both businesses and local communes. Efforts include installing bilingual signs and posters for regional events, as well as encouraging the use of the [[Spilhennig]] to let speakers identify each other. The office also started an [[Internationalization and localization]] policy asking [[Google]], [[Firefox]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mozilla.org/br/firefox/fx/|title=Browse Freely|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{br icon}} [http://www.drouizig.org/index.php/br/troidigezh-br/kenrouedad-br/231-firefox-ha-thunderbird Firefox ha Thunderbird]</ref> and [[SPIP]] to develop their interfaces in Breton. In 2004, the [[Breton Wikipedia]] started, which now counts more than 65,000 articles.

In the other regions of Tr\u00e9gor {{IPA|[\u027e]}} or even {{IPA|[\u0279]}} may be found.\n* The voiced dental fricative ({{IPAslink|\u00f0}}) is a conservative realisation of the [[lenition]] (or the \"spirant mutation\" in cases where the phenomenon originates from the mutation of {{IPA|/t~\u03b8/}}, respectively) of the consonants {{IPA|/d/}} and {{IPA|/t/}} which is to be found in certain varieties of Haut-Vannetais. Most of the Breton dialects do not inherit the sound and thus it is mostly not orthographically fixed. The Peurunvan, for instance, uses{{angbr|z}}  for both mutations which is regularly and more prominently pronounced {{IPA|[z]}} in L\u00e9onais, Cornouaillais, Tr\u00e9gorrois and Bas-Vannetais. In traditional literature written in the Vannetais dialect, two different graphemes are employed for representing the dental fricative, depending on the scripture's historical period. There once was a time when {{angbr|d}} was used to transcribe the sound but today mostly the regular {{angbr|z}} is instead used, and this practice can be traced back to at least the end of the 17th century.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Christmas Hymns in the Vannes Dialect of Breton|publisher=Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies|year=1956|isbn=|editor-last=Hemon|editor-first=Roparz|location=Dublin|pages=x, xxvi|quote=|via=}}</ref> The area this phenomenon has been found to be evident in, encompasses the towns of [[Pontivy]] and [[Baud, Morbihan|Baud]] and surrounding smaller villages like [[Cl\u00e9gu\u00e9rec|Cl\u00e9guerec]], [[Noyal-Pontivy]], [[Plum\u00e9liau]], [[Saint-Allouestre|St. Allouestre]], [[Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy, Morbihan|St. Barth\u00e9lemy]], [[Pluvigner]] and also parts of [[Belle \u00cele|Belle-\u00cele]]. The only known place where the mutation occurs outside of the Vannes country is the [[\u00cele de Sein|\u00cele de-Sein]], an island located off [[Finist\u00e8re]]'s coast. Some scholars also used {{IPA|[\u1e93]}} as the symbol for the sound to indicate that it was rather an \"infra-dental\" consonant than a clear interdental, which is the sound the symbol {{IPA|/\u00f0/}} is usually describes. Other linguists, however, did not draw that distinction, either because they identified the sound to actually be an interdental fricative (such as Roparz Hemon in his phonetic transcription of the dialect used in Plum\u00e9liau or Joseph Loth in his material about the dialect of [[Sauzon]] in Belle-\u00cele) or due to the fact that they merely attached any importance to it and ascertained that their descriptions were not in need of a further clarification of the sound's phonetic realisation as it was a clearly distinguishable phoneme.<ref>{{Cite book |title=A Historical Phonology of Breton|last=Jackson|first=Kenneth H.|publisher=Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies|year=1968|isbn=|location=Dublin|pages=661 ff|quote=|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title = A Historical Morphology and Syntax of Breton|last = Hemon|first = Roparz|publisher = Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies|year = 1975|isbn = 978-0901282637|location = Dublin|pages = 5}}</ref>\n\n==Grammar==\n{{main|Breton grammar}}\n<!-- Description of the grammar of the language. -->\n\n===Verbal aspect===\nAs in [[English language|English]] as well as the other Celtic languages, a variety of verbal constructions are available to express [[grammatical aspect]], for example: showing a distinction between [[progressive tense|progressive]] and habitual actions:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!

However, this is uncertain: for instance, ''menhir'' is ''peulvan'' or ''maen hir'' (\"long stone\"), ''maen sav'' (\"straight stone\") (two words: noun + adjective) in Breton. ''Dolmen'' is a misconstructed word (it should be ''taol-'''''v'''''aen''). Some studies state{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} that these words were borrowed from [[Cornish language|Cornish]]. {{lang|cy|Maen hir}} can be directly translated from Welsh as \"long stone\" (which is exactly what a {{lang|br|menhir}} or {{lang|br|maen hir}} is). The Cornish surnames Mennear, Minear and Manhire all derive from the Cornish ''{{wikt-lang|kw|men}} {{wikt-lang|kw|hyr}}'' (\"long stone\"), as does Tremenheere \"settlement by the long stone\".\n\nThe French word {{wikt-lang|fr|baragouiner}} (\"to jabber in a foreign language\") is derived from Breton ''{{wikt-lang|br|bara}}'' (\"bread\") and ''{{wikt-lang|br|gwin}}'' (\"wine\").  The French word {{wikt-lang|fr|go\u00e9land}} (\"large seagull\") is derived from Breton ''{{wikt-lang|br|gwelan}}'', which shares the same root as English \"gull\" (Welsh ''{{wikt-lang|cy|gwylan}}'', Cornish ''{{wikt-lang|kw|goelann}}'').\n\n==Orthography==\nThe first extant Breton texts, contained in the Leyde manuscript, were written at the end of the 8th century: 50 years prior to the [[Strasbourg Oaths]], considered to be the earliest example of [[French language|French]]. Like many medieval orthographies, Old- and Middle Breton orthography was at first not standardised, and the spelling of a particular word varied at authors' discretion. In 1499, however, the ''[[Catholicon (trilingual dictionary)|Catholicon]]'', was published; as the first dictionary written for both French and Breton, it became a point of reference on how to transcribe the language. The orthography presented in the ''Catholicon'' was largely similar to that of French, in particular with respect to the representation of vowels, as well as the use of both the Latinate digraph {{angbr|qu}}\u2014a remnant of the sound change /k\u02b7/ > /k/ in Latin\u2014and Brittonic {{angbr|cou-}}or {{angbr|cu-}} to represent /k/ before front vowels.\n\nAs phonetic and phonological differences between the dialects began to magnify, many regions, particularly the Vannes country, began to devise their own orthographies. Many of these orthographies were more closely related to the French model, albeit with some modifications. Examples of these modifications include the replacement of Old Breton {{angbr|-z}} with {{angbr|-h}} to denote word-final /x~h/ (an evolution of Old Breton /\u03b8/ in the Vannes dialect) and use of {{angbr|-h}} to denote the initial mutation of /k/ (today this mutation is written {{angbr|c'h}}).<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Historical Morphology and Syntax of Breton|last=Hemon|first=Roparz|publisher=Dublin Institute of Advanced Studies|year=1975|isbn=|location=Dublin|pages=5|quote=|via=}}</ref> and thus needed another transcription.\n\nIn the 1830s [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Le Gonidec]] created a modern phonetic system for the language.\n\nDuring the early years of the 20th century, a group of writers known as {{lang|br|Emglev ar Skrivanerien}} elaborated and reformed Le Gonidec's system. They made it more suitable as a super-dialectal representation of the dialects of [[Cornouaille]], Leon and Tr\u00e9gor (known as from ''Kernev'', ''Leon'' and ''Treger'' in Breton). This '''KLT''' orthography was established in 1911. At the same time writers of the more divergent Vannetais dialect developed a phonetic system also based on that of Le Gonidec.\n\nFollowing proposals made during the 1920s, the KLT and Vannetais orthographies were merged in 1941 to create an orthographic system to represent all four dialects. This {{lang|br|Peurunvan}} (\"wholly unified\") orthography was significant for the inclusion of the ''zh'' [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]], which represents a {{IPA|/h/}} in Vannetais and corresponds to a {{IPA|/z/}} in the KLT dialects.\n\nIn 1955 [[Fran\u00e7ois Falc'hun]] and the group Emgleo Breiz proposed a new orthography. It was designed to use a set of [[graphemes]] closer to the conventions of French. This {{lang|fr|Orthographie Universitaire}} (\"University Orthography\", known in Breton as {{lang|br|Skolveurieg}}) was given official recognition by the French authorities as the \"official orthography of Breton in French education.\" It was opposed in the region and today is used only by the magazine ''Brud Nevez'' and the publishing house Emgl\u00e9o Breiz.\n\nBetween 1971 and 1974, a new standard orthography was devised \u2014 the {{lang|br|etrerannyezhel}} or {{lang|fr|interdialectale}}. This system is based on the derivation of the words.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}\n\nToday the majority of writers continue to use the ''Peurunvan orthography'', and it is the version taught in most Breton-language schools.\n\nDue to the deficient suitableness of those standardised, interdialectal orthography for many dialects (especially the Vannes dialect) they are seen as a threat by some activists, rather than as a helping tool for promoting and spreading the language because it endangers the rich variety of the still living dialects and encourages the usage of a de facto non-existent artificial language.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://projetbabel.org/bretonguened/skriturieu|title=Breton Gu\u00e9ned, Le breton vannetais |last=le Goff |first=S\u00e9bastien |date= |website=projetbabel.org |access-date=2017-01-05 }}</ref>\n\n===Alphabet===\nBreton is written in the [[Latin script]]. ''Peurunvan'', the most commonly used orthography, consists of the following letters:\n\n: a, b, ch, c'h, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, r, s, t, u, v, w, y, z\n\nThe [[circumflex]], [[grave accent]], [[trema (diacritic)|trema]] and [[tilde]] appear on some letters. These [[diacritic]]s are used in the following way:\n\n: \u00e2, \u00ea, \u00ee, \u00f4, \u00fb, \u00f9, \u00fc, \u00f1\n\nSee [[v:Introduction to Breton/Breton pronunciation]] for an introduction to the Breton alphabet and pronunciation.\n\n===Differences between {{lang|br|Skolveurieg}} and {{lang|br|Peurunvan}}===\nBoth orthographies use the above alphabet, although ''\u00e9'' is used only in {{lang|br|Skolveurieg}}.\n\nDifferences between the two systems are particularly noticeable in word endings. In Peurunvan, final [[obstruent]]s, which are devoiced in absolute final position and voiced in [[sandhi]] before voiced sounds, are represented by a grapheme that indicates a voiceless sound. In OU they are written as voiced but represented as voiceless before suffixes: {{lang|br|braz}} (big), {{lang|br|brasoc'h}} (bigger).\n\nIn addition, Peurunvan maintains the KLT convention, which distinguishes noun/adjective pairs by nouns written with a final voiced consonant and adjectives with a voiceless one. No distinction is made in pronunciation, e.g. '''{{lang|br|brezhoneg}}''' ''Breton language'' vs. '''{{lang|br|brezhonek}}''' ''Breton (adj)''.\n\nSome examples of words in the different orthographies:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! {{lang|br|Etrerannyezhel}} (1975) !! {{lang|br|Peurunvan}} (1941) !! {{lang|br|Skolveurieg}} (1956)\n|-\n| {{lang|br|glaw}} || {{lang|br|glav}} || {{lang|br|glao}}\n|-\n| {{lang|br|piw}} || {{lang|br|piv}} || {{lang|br|piou}}\n|-\n| {{lang|br|levr}} || {{lang|br|levr}} || {{lang|br|leor}}\n|-\n| {{lang|br|ewid}} || {{lang|br|evit}} || {{lang|br|evid}}\n|-\n| {{lang|br|gant}} || {{lang|br|gant}} || {{lang|br|gand}}\n|-\n| {{lang|br|anezhi}} || {{lang|br|anezhi}} || {{lang|br|anezi}}\n|-\n| {{lang|br|ouzhpenn}} || {{lang|br|ouzhpenn}} || {{lang|br|ouspenn}}\n|-\n| {{lang|br|brawa\u00f1}} || {{lang|br|brava\u00f1}} || {{lang|br|brava}}\n|-\n| {{lang|br|pelec'h}} || {{lang|br|pelec'h}} || {{lang|br|peleh}}\n|}\n\n===Pronunciation of the Breton alphabet===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

Brochs belong to the classification \"complex [[atlantic roundhouse]]\" devised by Scottish [[archaeologist]]s in the 1980s. Their origin is a matter of some controversy.\n\n==Origin and definition==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=August 2017}}\nThe word ''broch'' is derived from [[Scots language|Lowland Scots]] 'brough', meaning (among other things) fort. In the mid-19th century Scottish [[Antiquarian|antiquaries]] called brochs 'burgs', after [[Old Norse]] ''{{lang|non|borg}}'', with the same meaning. Place names in Scandinavian Scotland such as Burgawater and Burgan show that Old Norse ''{{lang|non|borg}}'' is the older word used for these structures in the north. Brochs are often referred to as ''[[dun]]s'' in the west. Antiquarians began to use the spelling ''broch'' in the 1870s.\n\nA precise definition for the word has proved elusive. Brochs are the most spectacular of a complex class of roundhouse buildings found throughout Atlantic Scotland. The [[Shetland Amenity Trust]] lists about 120 sites in [[Shetland]] as candidate brochs, while the [[Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland]] (RCAHMS) identifies a total of 571 candidate broch sites throughout the country. Researcher Euan MacKie has proposed a much smaller total for Scotland of 104.<ref>Armit (2003) p. 16.</ref>\n[[File:Broch of Mousa - geograph.org.uk - 2800.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Broch of Mousa]]]]\nThe origin of brochs is a subject of continuing research. Sixty years ago most archaeologists believed that brochs, usually regarded as the 'castles' of Iron Age chieftains, were built by immigrants who had been pushed northward after being displaced first by the intrusions of [[Belgae|Belgic tribes]] into what is now southeast England at the end of the second century BC and later by the [[Scotland during the Roman Empire|Roman invasion]] of southern Britain beginning in AD 43. Yet there is now little doubt that the hollow-walled broch tower was purely an invention in what is now Scotland; even the kinds of pottery found inside them that most resembled south British styles were local hybrid forms. The first of the modern review articles on the subject (MacKie 1965)<ref>MacKie, E. W. (1965) 'The origin and development of the broch and wheelhouse building cultures of the Scottish Iron Age'. Proceedings of the Prehistoric Society 31, pp. 93\u2013146.</ref> did not, as is commonly believed, propose that brochs were built by immigrants, but rather that a hybrid culture formed from the blending of a small number of immigrants with the native population of the Hebrides produced them in the first century BC, basing them on earlier, simpler, promontory forts. This view contrasted, for example, with that of Sir [[W. Lindsay Scott]], who argued,<ref>Scott, Sir Lindsay (1947), 'The problem of the brochs', Proceedings of the Prehistoric Society 13, pages 1\u201336.</ref> following Childe (1935),<ref>Childe, V. G. (1935) ''The Prehistory of Scotland''. London.</ref> for a wholesale migration into Atlantic Scotland of people from southwest England.\n\nMacKie's theory has fallen from favour too, mainly because starting in the 1970s there was a general move in archaeology away from 'diffusionist' explanations towards those pointing to exclusively indigenous development. Meanwhile, the increasing number \u2013 albeit still pitifully few \u2013 of [[radiocarbon]] dates for the primary use of brochs (as opposed to their later, secondary use) still suggests that most of the towers were built in the 1st centuries BC and AD.<ref>Parker Pearson, M. & Sharples, N.

[[Caithness]], Sutherland and the [[Northern Isles]] have the densest concentrations, but there are a great many examples in the west of Scotland and the [[Hebrides]]. Although mainly concentrated in the northern Highlands and the Islands, a few examples occur in the [[Scottish Borders|Borders]] (for example [[Edin's Hall Broch]] and [[Bow Castle Broch]]); on the west coast of [[Dumfries and Galloway]]; and near [[Stirling]]. In a c.1560 sketch there appears to be a broch by the river next to [[Annan Castle]] in Dumfries and Galloway.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/seventhreportwit00scotuoft|title=Seventh report with inventory of monuments and constructions in the county of Dumfries|first1=|last1=Scotland.

They were sometimes regarded as the work of Danes or Picts. From the 1930s to the 1960s, archaeologists such as [[V. Gordon Childe]] and later John Hamilton<ref>Hamilton, J.R.C. (1968) ''Excavations at Clickhimin, Shetland''. Edinburgh.</ref> regarded them as castles where local landowners held sway over a subject population.\n\nThe castle theory fell from favour among Scottish archaeologists in the 1980s, due to a lack of supporting archaeological evidence. These archaeologists suggested defensibility was never a major concern in the siting of a broch, and argued that they may have been the \"[[stately home]]s\" of their time, objects of prestige and very visible demonstrations of superiority for important families (Armit 2003). Once again, however, there is a lack of archaeological proof for this reconstruction, and the sheer number of brochs, sometimes in places with a lack of good land, makes it problematic.\n\nBrochs' close groupings and profusion in many areas may indeed suggest that they had a primarily defensive or even offensive function. Some of them were sited beside precipitous cliffs and were protected by large ramparts, artificial or natural: a good example is at Burland near Gulberwick in [[Shetland]], on a clifftop and cut off from the mainland by huge ditches. Often they are at key strategic points. In Shetland they sometimes cluster on each side of narrow stretches of water: the broch of [[Mousa]], for instance, is directly opposite another at Burraland in Sandwick. In [[Orkney]] there are more than a dozen on the facing shores of Eynhallow Sound, and many at the exits and entrances of the great harbour of [[Scapa Flow]]. In [[Sutherland]] quite a few are placed along the sides and at the mouths of deep valleys. Writing in 1956 John Stewart suggested that brochs were forts put up by a military society to scan and protect the countryside and seas.<ref>Stewart, J. (1956) ''An Outline of Shetland Archaeology'', Lerwick: Shetland Times Ltd.</ref>\n\nFinally, some archaeologists consider broch sites individually, doubting that there ever was a single common purpose for which every broch was constructed. There are differences between the various areas in which brochs are found, with regard to position, dimensions and likely status. For example, the broch \"villages\" which occur at a few places in [[Orkney]] have no parallel in the [[Western Isles]].\n\n==Structures==\nGenerally, brochs have a single entrance with bar-holes, door-checks and lintels. There are mural cells and there is a scarcement (ledge), perhaps for timber-framed lean-to dwellings lining the inner face of the wall. Also there is a spiral staircase winding upwards between the inner and outer wall and connecting the galleries.<ref>Prehistoric Scotland (R.W. Feachem, 1992)<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref> Brochs vary from 5 to 15&nbsp;metres (16\u201350&nbsp;ft) in internal diameter, with 3&nbsp;metre (10&nbsp;ft) thick walls. On average, the walls only survive to a few metres in height. There are five extant examples of towers with significantly higher walls: [[Dun Carloway]] on [[Isle of Lewis|Lewis]], [[Dun Telve]] and [[Dun Troddan]] in [[Glenelg, Scotland|Glenelg]], [[Broch of Mousa|Mousa]] in Shetland and [[Dun Dornaigil]] in Sutherland, all of whose walls exceed 6.5&nbsp;m (21&nbsp;ft) in height.<ref>Armit (2003) p. 55.</ref>\n\nMousa's walls are the best preserved and are still 13&nbsp;m tall; it is not clear how many brochs originally stood this high. A frequent characteristic is that the walls are galleried: with an open space between, the outer and inner wall skins are separate but tied together with linking stone slabs; these linking slabs may in some cases have served as steps to higher floors. It is normal for there to be a cell breaking off from the passage beside the door; this is known as the guard cell. It has been found in some Shetland brochs that guard cells in entrance passageways are close to large door-check stones. Although there was much argument in the past, it is now generally accepted among archaeologists that brochs were roofed, perhaps with a conical timber framed roof covered with a locally sourced thatch. The evidence for this assertion is still fairly scanty, although excavations at Dun Bharabhat, Lewis, may support it.

He shared the scene with a then-unknown, non-speaking [[Dana Carvey]], stating famously that \"Mime is money.\" He later starred in the action comedy ''[[Running Scared (1986 film)|Running Scared]]'' (1986) and was directed by Reiner again in ''[[The Princess Bride (film)|The Princess Bride]]'' (1987), in a comedic supporting role as \"Miracle Max\". Reiner got Crystal to accept the part by saying, \"How would you like to play Mel Brooks?\" Reiner also allowed Crystal to ad-lib, and his parting shot, \"Have fun storming the castle!\" is a frequently-quoted line.\n\nReiner directed Crystal for a third time in the romantic comedy ''[[When Harry Met Sally...]]'' (1989), in which Crystal starred alongside [[Meg Ryan]] and for which he was nominated for a [[Golden Globe]]. The film has since become an iconic classic for the genre and is Crystal's most celebrated film. Crystal then starred in the award-winning buddy comedy ''[[City Slickers]]'' (1991), which proved very successful both commercially and critically and for which Crystal was nominated for his second Golden Globe. The film was followed by a sequel, which was less successful. In 1992, he narrated ''[[Dr. Seuss]] Video Classics: [[Horton Hatches the Egg]]''.\n\nFollowing the significant success of these films, Crystal wrote, directed, and starred in ''[[Mr. Saturday Night]]'' (1992) and ''[[Forget Paris]]'' (1995). In the former, Crystal played a serious role in aging makeup, as an egotistical comedian who reflects back on his career, although the character was from his ''SNL'' days. Though some of his subsequent films were not as well received as his earlier hits, Crystal had another success alongside [[Robert De Niro]] in [[Harold Ramis]]' mobster comedy ''[[Analyze This]]'' (1999). More recent performances include roles in ''[[America's Sweethearts]]'' (2001), the sequel ''[[Analyze That]]'' (2002), and ''[[Parental Guidance (film)|Parental Guidance]]'' (2012).\n\nHe directed the made-for-television movie ''[[61*]]'' (2001) based on [[Roger Maris]]'s and [[Mickey Mantle]]'s race to break [[Babe Ruth]]'s single-season home run record in 1961. This earned Crystal an [[Emmy]] nomination for Outstanding Directing for a Miniseries, Movie or a Special.\n\nCrystal was originally asked to voice [[Buzz Lightyear]] in ''[[Toy Story]]'' (1995) but turned it down, a decision he later regretted due to the popularity of the series.<ref name=\"actors\"/> Crystal later went on to provide the voice of Mike Wazowski in the blockbuster Pixar film ''[[Monsters, Inc.]]'' (2001), and reprised his voice role in the prequel, ''[[Monsters University]]'', which was released in June 2013. Crystal also provided the voice of [[Calcifer]] in the English version of [[Hayao Miyazaki]]'s ''[[Howl's Moving Castle (film)|Howl's Moving Castle]]'' (2004).\n\n==== Academy Awards hosting ====\nCrystal hosted the [[Academy Awards]] broadcast in 1990\u20131993, 1997, 1998, 2000, 2004 and 2012. His hosting was critically praised, resulting in two Emmy wins for hosting and writing the 63rd Academy Awards and an Emmy win for writing the 64th Academy Awards.

Years later on ''[[The Dinah Shore Show]]'', in one of his first television appearances, Crystal met Mantle in person and had Mantle re-sign the same program. Crystal would be good friends with Mickey Mantle until Mantle's death in 1995. He and [[Bob Costas]] together wrote the eulogy Costas read at Mantle's funeral, and [[George Steinbrenner]] then invited Crystal to emcee the unveiling of Mantle's monument at [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]]. In his 2013 memoir ''Still Foolin' 'Em'', Crystal writes that after the ceremony, near the Yankee clubhouse, he was punched in the stomach by [[Joe DiMaggio]], who was angry at Crystal for not having introduced him to the crowd as the \"Greatest living player\".\n\nCrystal also was well known for his impressions of Yankee Hall of Famer turned broadcaster [[Phil Rizzuto]].

This temperature is on the order of billionths of a kelvin for [[stellar black hole|black holes of stellar mass]], making it essentially impossible to observe.\n\nObjects whose [[gravitational field]]s are too strong for light to escape were first considered in the 18th century by [[John Michell]] and [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]].<ref name=origin/> The first modern solution of general relativity that would characterize a black hole was found by [[Karl Schwarzschild]] in 1916, although its interpretation as a region of space from which nothing can escape was first published by [[David Finkelstein]] in 1958. Black holes were long considered a mathematical curiosity; it was during the 1960s that theoretical work showed they were a generic prediction of general relativity. The discovery of [[neutron star]]s in the late 1960s sparked interest in [[gravitational collapse|gravitationally collapsed]] compact objects as a possible astrophysical reality.\n\nBlack holes of stellar mass are expected to form when very massive stars collapse at the end of their life cycle. After a black hole has formed, it can continue to grow by absorbing mass from its surroundings. By absorbing other stars and merging with other black holes, [[supermassive black hole]]s of millions of [[solar mass]]es ({{Solar mass|link=y}}) may form. There is general consensus that supermassive black holes exist in the centers of most [[galaxy|galaxies]].\n\nDespite its invisible interior, the presence of a black hole can be inferred through its interaction with other [[matter]] and with [[electromagnetic radiation]] such as visible light. Matter that falls onto a black hole can form an external [[accretion disk]] heated by friction, forming some of the [[Quasar|brightest objects in the universe]]. If there are other stars orbiting a black hole, their orbits can be used to determine the black hole's mass and location. Such observations can be used to exclude possible alternatives such as neutron stars. In this way, astronomers have identified numerous stellar black hole candidates in [[binary star|binary systems]], and established that the radio source known as [[Sagittarius A*]], at the core of the [[Milky Way]] galaxy, contains a supermassive black hole of about 4.3 million [[solar mass]]es.\n\nOn 11 February 2016, the [[LIGO]] collaboration [[first observation of gravitational waves|announced the first direct detection]] of [[gravitational wave]]s, which also represented the first observation of a black hole merger.<ref name=\"PRL-20160211\" /> As of April 2018, six [[List of gravitational wave observations|gravitational wave events]] have been observed that originated from merging black holes.<ref name=\"ligo list\">{{cite web|title=Detection of gravitational waves|url=https://www.ligo.org/detections.php|publisher=[[LIGO]]|accessdate=9 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[File:BlackHole Lensing.gif|thumb|alt=Schwarzschild black hole|Simulation of [[gravitational lens]]ing by a black hole, which distorts the image of a [[galaxy]] in the background]]\n\n[[File:Images of gas cloud being ripped apart by the black hole at the centre of the Milky Way ESO.jpg|thumb|Gas cloud being ripped apart by black hole at the centre of the [[Milky Way]] (observations from 2006, 2010 and 2013 are shown in blue, green and red, respectively).<ref>{{cite news|title=Ripped Apart by a Black Hole|url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1332/|accessdate=19 July 2013|newspaper=ESO Press Release|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130721014626/http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1332/|archivedate=21 July 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>]]\n\n==History==\n[[File:BH LMC.png|thumb|Simulated view of a black hole in front of the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]].

Michell's simplistic calculations assumed that such a body might have the same density as the Sun, and concluded that such a body would form when a star's diameter exceeds the Sun's by a factor of 500, and the surface [[escape velocity]] exceeds the usual speed of light. Michell correctly noted that such supermassive but non-radiating bodies might be detectable through their gravitational effects on nearby visible bodies.<ref>{{Cite journal\n |last=Michell |first=J. |authorlink1=John Michell\n |date=1784\n |title=On the Means of Discovering the Distance, Magnitude, &c. of the Fixed Stars, in Consequence of the Diminution of the Velocity of Their Light, in Case Such a Diminution Should be Found to Take Place in any of Them, and Such Other Data Should be Procured from Observations, as Would be Farther Necessary for That Purpose.

Firstly, the force of gravitation would be so great that light would be unable to escape from it, the rays falling back to the star like a stone to the earth. Secondly, the red shift of the spectral lines would be so great that the spectrum would be shifted out of existence.

In the current epoch of the universe these high densities are only found in stars, but in the early universe shortly after the [[Big Bang]] densities were much greater, possibly allowing for the creation of black holes. High density alone is not enough to allow black hole formation since a uniform mass distribution will not allow the mass to bunch up. In order for [[primordial black holes]] to have formed in such a dense medium, there must have been initial density perturbations that could then grow under their own gravity. Different models for the early universe vary widely in their predictions of the scale of these fluctuations. Various models predict the creation of primordial black holes ranging in size from a [[Planck mass]] to hundreds of thousands of solar masses.<ref name=\"carr primordial\">{{cite book\n |last1=Carr |first1=B.

Observations have been made of weak gravitational lensing, in which light rays are deflected by only a few [[arcseconds]].

As with classical objects at [[absolute zero]] temperature, it was assumed that black holes had zero entropy. If this were the case, the second law of thermodynamics would be violated by entropy-laden matter entering a black hole, resulting in a decrease of the total entropy of the universe. Therefore, Bekenstein proposed that a black hole should have an entropy, and that it should be proportional to its horizon area.<ref name=\"wald99\">{{cite journal\n |last=Wald\n |first=R.

This seemingly causes a violation of the second law of black hole mechanics, since the radiation will carry away energy from the black hole causing it to shrink. The radiation, however also carries away entropy, and it can be proven under general assumptions that the sum of the entropy of the matter surrounding a black hole and one quarter of the area of the horizon as measured in [[Planck units]] is in fact always increasing. This allows the formulation of the [[first law of black hole mechanics]] as an analogue of the [[first law of thermodynamics]], with the mass acting as energy, the surface gravity as temperature and the area as entropy.<ref name=\"wald99\"/>\n\nOne puzzling feature is that the entropy of a black hole scales with its area rather than with its volume, since entropy is normally an [[extensive quantity]] that scales linearly with the volume of the system.

In [[statistical mechanics]], entropy is understood as counting the number of microscopic configurations of a system that have the same macroscopic qualities (such as [[mass]], [[Charge (physics)|charge]], [[pressure]], etc.). Without a satisfactory theory of [[quantum gravity]], one cannot perform such a computation for black holes. Some progress has been made in various approaches to quantum gravity.

Regardless of the type of matter which goes into a black hole, it appears that only information concerning the total mass, charge, and angular momentum are conserved. As long as black holes were thought to persist forever this information loss is not that problematic, as the information can be thought of as existing inside the black hole, inaccessible from the outside, but represented on the event horizon in accordance with the holograpic principle. However, black holes slowly evaporate by emitting [[Hawking radiation]].

For example, beta decay of a [[neutron]] transforms it into a [[proton]] by the emission of an electron, or conversely a proton is converted into a neutron by the emission of a positron ([[positron emission]]), thus changing the [[nuclide]] type. Neither the beta particle nor its associated neutrino exist within the nucleus prior to beta decay, but are created in the decay process. By this process, unstable atoms obtain a more stable [[proton\u2013neutron ratio|ratio of protons to neutrons]]. The probability of a nuclide decaying due to beta and other forms of decay is determined by its [[nuclear binding energy]]. The binding energies of all existing nuclides form what is called the nuclear band or [[valley of stability]].<ref name=\"konya74\">\n{{cite book\n |last1=Konya |first1=J.\n |last2=Nagy |first2=N.

In beta minus (\u03b2<sup>\u2212</sup>) decay, a neutron is converted to a proton, and the process creates an electron and an [[electron antineutrino]]; while in beta plus (\u03b2<sup>+</sup>) decay, a proton is converted to a neutron and the process creates a positron and an electron neutrino. \u03b2<sup>+</sup> decay is also known as [[positron emission]].<ref>\n{{Cite book\n |last1=Basdevant |first1=J.-L.\n |last2=Rich |first2=J.\n |last3=Spiro |first3=M.\n |year=2005\n |title=Fundamentals in Nuclear Physics: From Nuclear Structure to Cosmology\n |publisher=[[Springer (publisher)|Springer]]\n |isbn=978-0387016726\n}}</ref>\n\nBeta decay conserves a quantum number known as the [[lepton number]], or the number of electrons and their associated neutrinos (other leptons are the [[muon]] and [[Tau (particle)|tau]] particles). These particles have lepton number +1, while their antiparticles have lepton number \u22121. Since a proton or neutron has lepton number zero, \u03b2<sup>+</sup> decay (a positron, or antielectron) must be accompanied with an electron neutrino, while \u03b2<sup>\u2212</sup> decay (an electron) must be accompanied by an electron antineutrino.\n\nAn example of electron emission (\u03b2<sup>\u2212</sup> decay) is the decay of [[carbon-14]] into [[nitrogen-14]] with a [[half-life]] of about 5,730 years:\n:{{nuclide|carbon|14}} \u2192 {{nuclide|nitrogen|14}} + {{subatomic particle|electron}} + {{subatomic particle|electron antineutrino}}\n:Or for example the decay of hydrogen-3 into helium-3 which is stable.  \n\nIn this form of decay, the original element becomes a new chemical element in a process known as [[nuclear transmutation]]. This new element has an unchanged [[mass number]] {{mvar|A}}, but an [[atomic number]] {{mvar|Z}} that is increased by one. As in all nuclear decays, the decaying element (in this case {{nuclide|carbon|14}}) is known as the ''parent nuclide'' while the resulting element (in this case {{nuclide|nitrogen|14}}) is known as the ''daughter nuclide''.\n\nAn example of positron emission (\u03b2<sup>+</sup> decay) is the decay of [[magnesium-23]] into [[sodium-23]] with a half-life of about 11.3 s:\n\n:{{nuclide|Magnesium|23}} \u2192 {{nuclide|Sodium|23}} + {{subatomic particle|positron}} + {{subatomic particle|electron neutrino}}\n\u03b2<sup>+</sup> decay also results in nuclear transmutation, with the resulting element having an atomic number that is decreased by one.\n\n[[File:RaE1.jpg|thumb|A beta spectrum, showing a typical division of energy between electron and antineutrino]]\nThe beta spectrum, or distribution of energy values for the beta particles, is continuous. The total energy of the decay process is divided between the electron, the antineutrino, and the recoiling nuclide. In the figure to the right, an example of an electron with 0.40 MeV energy from the beta decay of <sup>210</sup>Bi is shown. In this example, the total decay energy is 1.16 MeV, so the antineutrino has the remaining energy: 1.16-0.40=0.76 MeV. An electron at the far right of the curve would have the maximum possible kinetic energy, leaving the energy of the neutrino to be only its small rest mass.\n\n==History==\n{{Refimprove section|date=September 2014}}\n\n===Discovery and initial characterization===\nRadioactivity was discovered in 1896 by [[Henri Becquerel]] in [[uranium]], and subsequently observed by [[Marie Curie|Marie]] and [[Pierre Curie]] in [[thorium]] and in the new elements [[polonium]] and [[radium]]. In 1899, [[Ernest Rutherford]] separated radioactive emissions into two types: alpha and beta (now beta minus), based on penetration of objects and ability to cause ionization. Alpha rays could be stopped by thin sheets of paper or aluminium, whereas beta rays could penetrate several millimetres of aluminium. In 1900, [[Paul Villard]] identified a still more penetrating type of radiation, which Rutherford identified as a fundamentally new type in 1903 and termed [[gamma ray]]s. Alpha, beta, and gamma are the first three letters of the [[Greek alphabet]].\n\nIn 1900, Becquerel measured the [[mass-to-charge ratio]] ({{math|''m''/''e''}}) for beta particles by the method of [[J.J.&nbsp;Thomson]] used to study cathode rays and identify the electron. He found that {{math|''m''/''e''}} for a beta particle is the same as for Thomson's electron, and therefore suggested that the beta particle is in fact an electron.<ref name=\"Handbook\">{{cite book|last1=L'Annunziata|first1=Michael|title=Handbook of Radioactivity Analysis|date=2012|publisher=Elsevier Inc.|page=3|edition=Third|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=S4FrejzJy0cC&pg=PA3#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=4 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1901, Rutherford and [[Frederick Soddy]] showed that alpha and beta radioactivity involves the [[Nuclear transmutation|transmutation]] of atoms into atoms of other chemical elements. In 1913, after the products of more radioactive decays were known, Soddy and [[Kazimierz Fajans]] independently proposed their [[Radioactive displacement law of Fajans and Soddy|radioactive displacement law]], which states that beta (i.e., {{SubatomicParticle|Beta-}})&nbsp;emission from one element produces another element one place to the right in the [[periodic table]], while alpha emission produces an element two places to the left.\n\n===Neutrinos===\n\nThe study of beta decay provided the first physical evidence for the existence of the [[neutrino]]. In both alpha and gamma decay, the resulting particle has a narrow energy [[Frequency distribution|distribution]], since the particle carries the energy from the difference between the initial and final nuclear states. However, the kinetic energy distribution, or spectrum, of beta particles measured by [[Lise Meitner]] and [[Otto Hahn]] in 1911 and by [[Jean Danysz]] in 1913 showed multiple lines on a diffuse background. These measurements offered the first hint that beta particles have a continuous spectrum.<ref name=\"Jensen\">\n{{cite book\n |last1=Jensen |first1=C.\n |year=2000\n |title=Controversy and Consensus: Nuclear Beta Decay 1911-1934\n |url=https://www.springer.com/birkhauser/physics/book/978-3-7643-5313-1\n |publisher=[[Birkh\u00e4user Verlag]]\n |isbn=978-3-7643-5313-1\n}}</ref> In 1914, [[James Chadwick]] used a magnetic [[spectrometer]] with one of [[Hans Geiger|Hans Geiger's]] new [[Geiger counter|counters]] to make more accurate measurements which showed that the spectrum was continuous.<ref name=\"Jensen\"/><ref>\n{{cite journal\n |last=Chadwick |first=J.\n |year=1914\n |title=Intensit\u00e4tsverteilung im magnetischen Spektren der \u03b2-Strahlen von Radium B + C\n |language=German\n |journal=[[Verhandlungen der Deutschen Physikalischen Gesellschaft]]\n |volume=16 |pages=383\u2013391\n |bibcode=\n |doi=\n}}</ref> The distribution of beta particle energies was in apparent contradiction to the [[law of conservation of energy]].

This spectrum was puzzling for many years.\n\nA second problem is related to the [[conservation of angular momentum]]. Molecular band spectra showed that the [[nuclear spin]] of [[nitrogen-14]] is 1 (i.e. equal to the [[reduced Planck constant]]) and more generally that the spin is integral for nuclei of even [[mass number]] and half-integral for nuclei of odd mass number. This was later explained by the [[Discovery of the neutron#Proton-neutron model of the nucleus|proton-neutron model of the nucleus]].<ref name=Brown/> Beta decay leaves the mass number unchanged, so the change of nuclear spin must be an integer. However, the electron spin is 1/2, hence angular momentum would not be conserved if beta decay were simply electron emission.\n\nFrom 1920\u20131927, [[Charles Drummond Ellis]] (along with Chadwick and colleagues) further established that the beta decay spectrum is continuous. In 1933, Ellis and [[Nevill Mott]] obtained strong evidence that the beta spectrum has an effective upper bound in energy. [[Niels Bohr]] had suggested that the beta spectrum could be explained if [[conservation of energy]] was true only in a statistical sense, thus this [[Laws of science|principle]] might be violated in any given decay.<ref name=Brown/>{{rp|27}} However, the upper bound in beta energies determined by Ellis and Mott ruled out that notion. Now, the problem of how to account for the variability of energy in known beta decay products, as well as for conservation of momentum and angular momentum in the process, became acute.\n\nIn a [[Electron neutrino#Pauli's letter|famous letter]] written in 1930, [[Wolfgang Pauli]] attempted to resolve the beta-particle energy conundrum by suggesting that, in addition to electrons and protons, atomic nuclei also contained an extremely light neutral particle, which he called the neutron. He suggested that this \"neutron\" was also emitted during beta decay (thus accounting for the known missing energy, momentum, and angular momentum), but it had simply not yet been observed. In 1931, [[Enrico Fermi]] renamed Pauli's \"neutron\" the \"neutrino\" (roughly 'little neutral one' in Italian). In 1934, Fermi published his landmark [[Fermi's interaction|theory for beta decay]], where he applied the principles of quantum mechanics to matter particles, supposing that they can be created and annihilated, just as the light quanta in atomic transitions. Thus, according to Fermi, neutrinos are created in the beta-decay process, rather than contained in the nucleus; the same happens to electrons. The neutrino interaction with matter was so weak that detecting it proved a severe experimental challenge. Further indirect evidence of the existence of the neutrino was obtained by observing the recoil of nuclei that emitted such a particle after absorbing an electron.

An often-cited example is the single isotope {{nuclide|copper|64|link=yes}} (29 protons, 35 neutrons), which illustrates three types of beta decay in competition. Copper-64 has a half-life of about 12.7 hours. This isotope has one unpaired proton and one unpaired neutron, so either the proton or the neutron can decay.

Since total angular momentum must be conserved, including orbital and spin angular momentum, beta decay occurs by a variety of quantum state transitions to various nuclear angular momentum or spin states, known as \"Fermi\" or \"Gamow-Teller\" transitions. When beta decay particles carry no angular momentum (L=0), the decay is referred to as \"allowed\", otherwise it is \"forbidden\".\n\nOther decay modes, which are rare, are known as bound state decay and double beta decay.\n\n===Fermi transitions===\nA '''Fermi transition''' is a beta decay in which the spins of the emitted electron (positron) and anti-neutrino (neutrino) couple to total spin <math>S=0</math>, leading to an angular momentum change <math>\\Delta J=0</math> between the initial and final states of the nucleus (assuming an allowed transition). In the non-relativistic limit, the nuclear part of the operator for a Fermi transition is given by\n\n:<math> \\mathcal{O}_{F}=G_{V}\\sum_{a} \\hat{\\tau}_{a\\pm} </math>\nwith <math>G_V</math> the weak vector coupling constant, <math>\\tau_{\\pm}</math> the [[isospin]] [[Ladder operator|raising and lowering operators]], and <math>a</math> running over all protons and neutrons in the nucleus.\n\n===Gamow-Teller transitions===\nA '''Gamow-Teller transition''' is a beta decay in which the spins of the emitted electron (positron) and anti-neutrino (neutrino) couple to total spin <math>S=1</math>, leading to an angular momentum change <math>\\Delta J=0,\\pm 1</math> between the initial and final states of the nucleus (assuming an allowed transition).\nIn this case, the nuclear part of the operator is given by\n\n:<math> \\mathcal{O}_{GT}=G_{A}\\sum_{a} \\hat{\\sigma}_{a}\\hat{\\tau}_{a\\pm} </math>\nwith <math>G_{A}</math> the weak axial-vector coupling constant, and <math>\\sigma</math> the [[Pauli matrices|spin Pauli matrices]], which can produce a spin-flip in the decaying nucleon.\n\n===Forbidden transitions===\nWhen {{math|''L'' > 0}}, the decay is referred to as [[forbidden transition|\"forbidden\"]]. Nuclear [[selection rule]]s require high L-values to be accompanied by changes in [[nuclear spin]]&nbsp;({{mvar|J}}) and [[Parity (physics)|parity]]&nbsp;(\u03c0). The selection rules for the {{mvar|L}}th forbidden transitions are:\n\n:<math>\\Delta J=L-1, L, L+1; \\Delta \\pi=(-1)^L, </math>\n\nwhere {{math|1=\u0394\u03c0=1}} or {{math|\u22121}} corresponds to no parity change or parity change, respectively. The special case of a transition between isobaric analogue states, where the structure of the final state is very similar to the structure of the initial state, is referred to as \"superallowed\" for beta decay, and proceeds very quickly. The following table lists the \u0394{{mvar|J}} and \u0394\u03c0 values for the first few values of&nbsp;{{mvar|L}}:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In nuclei for which both \u03b2&nbsp;decay and \u03b2\u03b2&nbsp;decay are possible, the rarer \u03b2\u03b2&nbsp;decay process is effectively impossible to observe.

The word, meaning \"lightning war\" or \"lightning attack\" in its strategic sense describes a series of quick and decisive short battles to deliver a knockout blow to an enemy state before it could fully mobilize. Tactically, blitzkrieg is a coordinated military effort by tanks, motorized infantry, artillery and aircraft, to create an overwhelming local superiority in combat power, to defeat the opponent and break through its defences.{{sfn|Keegan|2005|p=109}}{{sfn|Harris|1995|pp=334\u2013336}} ''Blitzkrieg'' as used by Germany had considerable psychological, or \"terror\" elements,{{efn|name=terror bombing}} such as the ''Jericho Trompete'', a noise-making siren on the [[Junkers Ju 87]] dive-bomber, to affect the morale of enemy forces.{{efn|name=Junker sirens}} The devices were largely removed when the enemy became used to the noise after the [[Battle of France]] in 1940 and instead bombs sometimes had whistles attached.{{sfn|Griehl| 2001|pp=31, 64\u201365}}{{sfn|Frieser|2005|p=345}} It is also common for historians and writers to include psychological warfare by using [[Fifth columnists]] to spread rumours and lies among the civilian population in the theatre of operations.{{sfn|Keegan|2005|p=109}}\n\n===Origin of the term===\nThe origin of the term ''blitzkrieg'' is obscure. It was never used in the title of a military doctrine or handbook of the German army or air force,{{sfn|Frieser|2005|pp=4\u20135}} and no \"coherent doctrine\" or \"unifying concept of blitzkrieg\" existed.{{sfn|Holmes|Strachan|Bellamy|Bicheno|2001|p=135}} The term seems rarely to have been used in the German military press before 1939 and recent research at the German ''[[Military History Research Office (Germany)|Milit\u00e4rgeschichtliches Forschungsamt]]'' at [[Potsdam]] found it in only two military articles from the 1930s. Both used the term to mean a swift strategic knock-out, rather than a radical new military doctrine or approach to war. The first article (1935) deals primarily with supplies of food and [[materiel]] in wartime. The term ''blitzkrieg'' is used with reference to German efforts to win a quick victory in the First World War but is not associated with the use of armoured, mechanised or air forces. It argued that Germany must develop self-sufficiency in food, because it might again prove impossible to deal a swift knock-out to its enemies, leading to a long war.{{sfn|Harris|1995|p=337}} In the second article (1938), launching a swift strategic knock-out is described as an attractive idea for Germany but difficult to achieve on land under modern conditions (especially against systems of [[fortification]] like the [[Maginot Line]]), unless an exceptionally high degree of surprise could be achieved. The author vaguely suggests that a massive strategic air attack might hold out better prospects but the topic is not explored in detail. A third relatively early use of the term in German occurs in ''Die Deutsche Kriegsst\u00e4rke'' (German War Strength) by Fritz Sternberg, a Jewish, [[Marxist]], political economist and refugee from the Third Reich, published in 1938 in Paris and in London as ''Germany and a Lightning War''. Sternberg wrote that Germany was not prepared economically for a long war but might win a quick war (''\"Blitzkrieg\"''). He did not go into detail about tactics or suggest that the German armed forces had evolved a radically new operational method. His book offers scant clues as to how German lightning victories might be won.{{sfn|Harris|1995|p=337}}\n \n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1987-1210-502, Polen, Stukas.jpg|thumb|Ju 87 Bs over Poland, September\u2013October 1939]]\nIn English and other languages, the term had been used since the 1920s.{{sfn|Fanning|1997|pp=283\u2013287}} The British press used it to describe the German successes in Poland in September 1939, called by Harris \"a piece of journalistic sensationalism \u2013 a buzz-word with which to label the spectacular early successes of the Germans in the Second World War\". It was later applied to the bombing of Britain, particularly London, hence \"[[The Blitz]]\".{{sfn|Harris|1995|pp=338\u2013339}} The German popular press followed suit nine months later, after the fall of France in 1940; hence although the word had been used in German, it was first popularized by British journalism.{{sfn|Harris|1995|pp=337\u2013338}}{{sfn|Frieser|2005|p=4}} [[Heinz Guderian]] referred to it as a word coined by the Allies: \"as a result of the successes of our rapid campaigns our enemies&nbsp;... coined the word ''Blitzkrieg''\".{{sfn|Harris|1995|pp=336\u2013338}} After the German failure in the Soviet Union in 1941, use of the term began to be frowned upon in the Third Reich, and Hitler then denied ever using the term, saying in a speech in November 1941, \"I have never used the word ''Blitzkrieg'', because it is a very silly word\".{{sfn|Frieser|2005|p=5}} In early January 1942, Hitler dismissed it as \"Italian phraseology\".{{sfn|Domarus|1973|p=1776}}{{sfn|Hitler|1942|p=173}}\n\n==Military evolution, 1919\u20131939==\n\n===Germany===\n{{Main article|Infiltration tactics}}\n\nIn 1914, German strategic thinking derived from the writings of [[Carl von Clausewitz]] (June 1, 1780 \u2013 November 16, 1831), [[Helmuth von Moltke the Elder]] (26 October 1800 \u2013 24 April 1891) and [[Alfred von Schlieffen]] (28 February 1833 \u2013 4 January 1913), who advocated manoeuvre, mass and envelopment to create the conditions for a decisive battle ({{lang|de|Vernichtungsschlacht}}). During the war, generals such as [[Oskar von Hutier]] developed tactics to restore manoeuvre on the battlefield. Specialist [[light infantry]] (''[[Stormtrooper|Sturmtruppen]]'', \"storm troops\") were to exploit soft spots, to make gaps for larger infantry units to advance with heavier weapons and exploit the success, leaving isolated strong points to troops following up. Hutier tactics were combined with short hurricane artillery bombardments using massed artillery, devised by Colonel [[Georg Bruchm\u00fcller]]. Attacks were to rely on speed and surprise rather than on weight of numbers. Hutier-Bruchm\u00fcller tactics met with great success in [[Spring Offensive|Operation Michael]], the spring offensive of 1918 and restored temporarily the war of movement, once the Allied trench system had been overrun. The German armies pushed on towards Amiens and then Paris, coming within {{convert|120|km|mi}} before supply difficulties and Allied reinforcements halted the advance.{{sfn|Perrett|1983|pp=30\u201331}}<!--not sure about the second half of the paragraph, Operation Mike was on a wide front-->\n\nOn the Eastern Front, the war did not bog down into [[trench warfare]]; German and Russian armies fought a war of manoeuvre over thousands of miles, which gave the German leadership unique experience not available to the trench-bound western Allies.{{sfn|Corum|1992|p=7}} Studies of operations in the east led to the conclusion that small and coordinated forces possessed more combat power than large, uncoordinated forces. After the war, the ''Reichswehr'' modified Hutier tactics. The commander in chief, [[Hans von Seeckt]], argued that there had been an excessive focus on encirclement and emphasized speed instead.{{sfn|Corum|1997|p=30}} Seeckt inspired a revision of ''[[Bewegungskrieg]]'' (maneuver warfare) thinking and its associated ''[[Auftragstaktik]]'', in which the commander gave his intent and subordinates the discretion to achieve it, within limits determined by the training of an elite officer-corps, which made their decisions predictable to other commanders. Delegation increased the tempo of operations, which had great influence on the success of German armies in the early war period. Seeckt rejected the idea of numerical superiority and developed the German army into a small, mobile force and encouraged technical advances, of which one of the results was enhancing the radio use, which allowed better coordination between motorized infantry, tanks and planes and thus provided the necessary conditions for the subsequent Blitzkrieg. He thus transformed it into an army of commanders, who could cover at least the next level of command.<ref>{{cite book |last1 =Paniccia |first1=Arduino |title=Reshaping the Future: Handbook for a new Strategy |date=Jan 14, 2014 |publisher=Mazzanti Libri \u2013 Me Publisher |isbn=9788898109180 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8o3wAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT56}}</ref>\n<!--The German leadership had been criticized{{by whom|date=March 2015}} for failing to understand the technical advances of the First World War, having given [[History of the tank|tank production]] the lowest priority and having conducted no studies of the [[machine gun]] prior to that war.{{sfn|Corum|1992|p=23}} In response, German officers attended [[technical school]]s during the period of rebuilding after the war.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}-->\n\nGerman operational theories were revised after the First World War.

The ''Reichswehr'' was influenced by its analysis of pre-war German military thought, in particular infiltration tactics, which at the end of the war had seen some breakthroughs on the Western Front<!--they might have thought this but there weren't any, even in 1918--> and the manoeuvre warfare which dominated the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]].\n\n===Britain===\n[[File:IWM-Q-12329-armoured-car-Megiddo-1918.jpg|thumb|right|British armoured car and motorcycle at the [[Battle of Megiddo (1918)]].]]\nThe British army took lessons from the successful infantry and artillery offensives on the Western Front in late 1918. To obtain the best co-operation between all arms, emphasis was placed on detailed planning, rigid control and adherence to orders. Mechanization of the army was considered a means to avoid mass casualties and indecisive nature of offensives, as part of a combined-arms theory of war.{{sfn|French|2000|pp=17\u201318}}{{sfn|Sheffield|2011|p=121}} The four editions of ''Field Service Regulations'' published after 1918 held that only combined-arms operations could create enough fire power to enable mobility on a battlefield.

Colonel [[Charles de Gaulle]]  advocated concentration of armour and aeroplanes. His opinions appeared in his book ''Vers l'Arm\u00e9e de M\u00e9tier'' (Towards the Professional Army, 1933). Like von Seeckt, de Gaulle concluded that France could no longer maintain the huge armies of conscripts and reservists which had fought World War I, and he sought to use tanks, mechanised forces and aircraft to allow a smaller number of highly-trained soldiers to have greater impact in battle. His views little endeared him to the French high command, but are claimed by some{{who?|date=July 2018}} to have influenced [[Heinz Guderian]].{{sfn|De Gaulle|2009|nopp=y}}\n\n===Russia/USSR===\nIn 1916, General [[Alexei Brusilov]] had used surprise and infiltration tactics during the [[Brusilov Offensive]]. Later, Marshal [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky]], Georgii Isserson and other members of the [[Red Army]] developed a concept of [[deep battle]] from the experience of the [[Polish\u2013Soviet War]]. These concepts would guide Red Army doctrine throughout World War II. Realising the limitations of infantry and cavalry, Tukhachevsky was an advocate of mechanised formations and the large-scale industrialisation required. Robert Watt (2008) wrote that blitzkrieg holds little in common with Soviet deep battle.{{sfn|Watt|2008|pp=677\u2013678}} In 2002, H. P.

In 1926, [[military exercise|War games]] and tests were begun at [[Kazan]] and [[Lipetsk]].

Within the Wehrmacht (established in 1935) the command for motorised armored forces was named the ''[[Panzerwaffe]]'' in 1936. The [[Luftwaffe]] (the German air force) was officially established in February 1935, and development began on ground-attack aircraft and doctrines. Hitler strongly supported this new strategy. He read Guderian's 1937 book ''[[Achtung \u2013 Panzer!]]'' and upon observing armoured field exercises at [[Kummersdorf]] he remarked, \"That is what I want \u2013 and that is what I will have.\"{{sfn|Guderian|2001|p=46}}{{sfn|Edwards|1989|p=24}}\n\n====Guderian====\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-139-1112-17, Heinz Guderian.jpg|thumb|upright|Heinz Guderian]]\nGuderian summarised combined-arms tactics as the way to get the mobile and motorised armoured divisions to work together and support each other to achieve decisive success. In his 1950 book, ''[[Panzer Leader (book)|Panzer Leader]]'', he wrote:\n\n{{quote|In this year, 1929, I became convinced that tanks working on their own or in conjunction with infantry could never achieve decisive importance. My historical studies, the exercises carried out in England and our own experience with mock-ups had persuaded me that the tanks would never be able to produce their full effect until the other weapons on whose support they must inevitably rely were brought up to their standard of speed and of cross-country performance. In such formation of all arms, the tanks must play primary role, the other weapons beings subordinated to the requirements of the armour. It would be wrong to include tanks in infantry divisions; what was needed were armoured divisions which would include all the supporting arms needed to allow the tanks to fight with full effect.{{sfn|Guderian|2001|p=13}}}}\n\nGuderian believed that developments in technology were required to support the theory; especially, equipping armoured divisions\u2014tanks\nforemost\u2013with wireless communications. Guderian insisted in 1933 to the high command that every tank in the German armoured force must be equipped with a radio.{{sfn|Guderian|2001|p=20}} At the start of World War II, only the German army was thus prepared with all tanks \"radio-equipped\". This proved critical in early tank battles where German tank commanders exploited the organizational advantage over the [[Allies of World War II | Allies]] that radio communication gave them. Later all Allied armies would copy this innovation. During the Polish campaign, the performance of armoured troops, under the influence of Guderian's ideas,  won over a number of skeptics who had initially expressed doubt about armoured warfare, such as von Rundstedt and Rommel.<ref>{{cite book|last1= Murray|first1= Williamson|title= Military Adaptation in War: With Fear of Change|date= 2011|publisher= Cambridge University Press|isbn= 9781139915861|page= 129|url= https://books.google.com.vn/books?id=fhMWAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA129&dq=rommel+guderian+skeptics+poland&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=rommel%20guderian%20skeptics%20poland&f=false}}</ref>\n\n====Rommel====\n\nAccording to David A.Grossman,<ref>{{cite book|last1= Grossman|first1= David A.|title= Maneuver Warfare in the Light Infantry-The Rommel Model|page= 1|url= http://www.killology.com/maneuver_warfare.pdf}}</ref> by the [[Battle of Caporetto |12th Battle of Isonzo]] (October-November 1917), while conducting a light-infantry operation, Rommel had perfected his maneuver-\nwarfare principles, which were the very same ones that were applied during the Blitzkrieg against France in 1940 (and repeated in the [[Coalition of the Gulf War | Coalition]]  ground offensive against Iraq in the [[1991 Gulf War]]).<ref>{{cite book|last1= Grossman|first1= David A.|title= Maneuver Warfare in the Light Infantry-The Rommel Model|pages= 1\u20133|url= http://www.killology.com/maneuver_warfare.pdf}}</ref>\nDuring the Battle of France, Hitler caused confusion when he suddenly changed his ideas and ordered that everything should be completed in a few weeks (his original plan would have taken years to complete), encouraging Rommel and Guderian to disobey their direct superiors' orders by forging ahead and, on the way, inventing the idea of Blitzkrieg.<ref>{{cite book|last1= Stroud|first1= Rick|title= The Phantom Army of Alamein: The Men Who Hoodwinked Rommel|date= 2013|publisher = A&C Black|isbn= 9781408831281|pages= 33\u201334|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=o2Hu9arToqkC&pg=PA33}}</ref>{{qn|date=July 2018}} It was Rommel who created the new archetype of Blitzkrieg, leading his division far ahead of flanking divisions.<ref>{{cite book|last1= Showalter|first1= Dennis|title= Patton And Rommel: Men of War in the Twentieth Century|date= Jan 3, 2006|publisher= Penguin|isbn= 9781440684685|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=bE1E2My2jvoC&pg=PT149}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1= Lee|first1= T.W.|title= Military Technologies of the World|date= 2008|publisher= ABC-CLIO|isbn= 9780275995362|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-nrZqzQs3jMC&pg=PA258&dq=%22calculating+daredevil%22+rommel&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=%22calculating%20daredevil%22%20rommel&f=false}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1= Brighton|first1= Terry|title= Patton, Montgomery, Rommel: Masters of War|date= 2008|isbn= 9781400114979|page= 247|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=GrN-kBGaUwoC&pg=PR95&dq=%22become+rommel%27s+blitzkrieg%22&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=%22become%20rommel%27s%20blitzkrieg%22&f=false}}</ref> MacGregor and Williamson remark that Rommel's version of Blitzkrieg displayed a significantly better understanding of combined-arms warfare than that of Guderian.<ref>{{cite book|last1= Murray|first1= Williamson|last2= MacGregor|first2= Knox|title= The Dynamics of Military Revolution, 1300\u20132050|date= 2001|publisher= Cambridge University Press|isbn= 9780521800792|page= 172|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=zIIbUmwXitAC&pg=PA172&dq=rommel+guderian+%22infantryman%22&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=rommel%20guderian%20%22infantryman%22&f=false}}</ref> General [[Hermann Hoth | Hoth]] submitted{{when?|date=July 2018}} an official report which declared that Rommel had \"explored new paths in the command of Panzer divisions\".<ref>{{cite book|last1= Showalter|first1= Dennis|title= Patton And Rommel: Men of War in the Twentieth Century|date= Jan 3, 2006|publisher= Penguin|isbn= 9781440684685|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=bE1E2My2jvoC&pg=PT150}}\n</ref>\n\n==Methods of operations==\n\n===''Schwerpunkt''===\n\n''Schwerpunktprinzip'' was a [[heuristic]] device (conceptual tool or thinking formula) used in the German army since the nineteenth century, to make decisions from tactics to strategy about priority. ''Schwerpunkt'' has been translated as ''centre of gravity'', ''crucial'', ''focal point'' and ''point of main effort''. None of these forms is sufficient to describe the universal importance of the term and the concept of ''Schwerpunktprinzip''. Every unit in the army, from the company to the supreme command, decided on a ''Schwerpunkt'' through ''schwerpunktbildung'', as did the support services, which meant that commanders always knew what was most important and why. The German army was trained to support the ''Schwerpunkt'', even when risks had to be taken elsewhere to support the point of main effort.{{sfn|Sheldon|2017|pp=vi, 17}} Through ''Schwerpunktbildung'', the German army could achieve superiority at the ''Schwerpunkt'', whether attacking or defending, to turn local success at the ''Schwerpunkt'' into the progressive disorganisation of the opposing force, creating more opportunities to exploit this advantage, even if numerically and [[Strategy|strategically]] inferior in general. In the 1930s, Guderian summarised this as \"Klotzen, nicht kleckern!\" (\"Kick, don't spatter them!\").{{sfn|Frieser|2005|pp=89\u201390, 156\u2013157}}{{sfn|Bevin|2002|p=227}}\n\n===Pursuit===\nHaving achieved a breakthrough of the enemy's line, units comprising the ''Schwerpunkt'' were not supposed to become decisively engaged with enemy front line units to the right and left of the breakthrough area. Units pouring through the hole were to drive upon set objectives behind the enemy front line. In World War II, German Panzer forces used motorised mobility, to paralyse the opponent's ability to react. Fast-moving mobile forces seized the initiative, exploited weaknesses and acted before opposing forces could respond. Central to this was the [[decision cycle]] (tempo). Decision-making required time to gather information, make a decision, give orders to subordinates to implement the decision. Through superior mobility and faster decision-making cycles, mobile forces could act quicker than the forces opposing them. [[Mission-type tactics|Directive control]] was a fast and flexible method of command. Rather than receiving an explicit order, a commander would be told of his [[Commander's intent|superior's intent]] and the role which his unit was to fill in this concept. The method of execution was then a matter for the discretion of the subordinate commander. Staff burden was reduced at the top and spread among tiers of command with knowledge about their situation. Delegation and the encouragement of initiative aided implementation, important decisions could be taken quickly and communicated verbally or with brief written orders.{{sfn|Frieser|2005|pp=344\u2013346}} Germans soldiers also used [[Methamphetamine#History, society, and culture|Pervitin]], a form of Amphetamine, which was given to drivers, to keep them awake.{{sfn|Frieser|2005|pp=119}}\n\n===Mopping-up===\nThe last part of an offensive operation was the destruction of un-subdued [[pocket (military)|pockets]] of resistance, which had been [[envelop]]ed earlier and by-passed by the fast-moving armoured and motorised spearheads. The ''Kesselschlacht'' 'cauldron battle' was a [[concentric]] attack on such pockets. It was here that most losses were inflicted upon the enemy, primarily through the mass capture of prisoners and weapons. During [[Operation Barbarossa]], huge encirclements in 1941 produced nearly 3.5 million Soviet prisoners, along with masses of equipment.{{sfn|Keegan|1987|p=265}}{{efn|name=Nazi crimes against Soviet POWs}}\n\n===Air power===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-646-5188-17, Flugzeuge Junkers Ju 87.jpg|thumb|The [[Junkers Ju 87|Ju 87 \"Stuka\"]] dive-bomber was used in blitzkrieg operations.]]\n[[Close air support]] was provided in the form of the [[dive bomber]] and [[medium bomber]]. They would support the focal point of attack from the air. German successes are closely related to the extent to which the German ''Luftwaffe'' was able to control the air war in early campaigns in Western and Central Europe, and the Soviet Union. However, the ''Luftwaffe'' was a broadly based force with no constricting central doctrine, other than its resources should be used generally to support national strategy. It was flexible and it was able to carry out both operational-tactical, and strategic bombing. Flexibility was the ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s strength in 1939\u20131941. Paradoxically, from that period onward it became its weakness. While Allied Air Forces were tied to the support of the Army, the ''Luftwaffe'' deployed its resources in a more general, operational way. It switched from [[air superiority]] missions, to medium-range interdiction, to strategic strikes, to close support duties depending on the need of the ground forces. In fact, far from it being a specialist panzer spearhead arm, less than 15 percent of the Luftwaffe was intended for close support of the army in 1939.{{sfn|Buckley|1998|pp=126\u2013127}}\n\n==Limitations and countermeasures==\n\n===Environment===\nThe concepts associated with the term ''blitzkrieg''\u2014deep penetrations by armour, large encirclements, and combined arms attacks\u2014were largely dependent upon terrain and weather conditions. Where the ability for rapid movement across \"tank country\" was not possible, armoured penetrations often were avoided or resulted in failure. Terrain would ideally be flat, firm, unobstructed by natural barriers or fortifications, and interspersed with roads and railways. If it were instead hilly, wooded, marshy, or urban, armour would be vulnerable to infantry in close-quarters combat and unable to break out at full speed. Additionally, units could be halted by mud ([[thaw (weather)|thawing]] along the Eastern Front regularly slowed both sides) or extreme snow. Armour, motorised and aerial support was also naturally dependent on weather.{{citation needed|date= July 2013 |reason= invalid ref: Holmes 2001 not found in bibliography}}\nIt should however be noted that the disadvantages of such terrain could be nullified if surprise was achieved over the enemy by an attack through such terrain. During the Battle of France, the German blitzkrieg-style attack on France went through the Ardennes. There is little doubt that the hilly, heavily wooded Ardennes could have been relatively easily defended by the Allies, even against the bulk of the German armoured units. However, precisely because the French thought the Ardennes unsuitable for massive troop movement, particularly for tanks, they were left with only light defences which were quickly overrun by the ''Wehrmacht''. The Germans quickly advanced through the forest, knocking down the trees the French thought would impede this tactic.{{sfn|Frieser|2005|pp=137\u2013144}}\n\n===Air superiority===\n[[File:Hawker Typhoon ExCC.jpg|thumb|alt=A British designed single engine ground attack aircraft equipped with cannon and rockets|The [[Hawker Typhoon]], especially when armed with eight [[RP-3]] rockets, posed a threat to German armour and motor vehicles during the [[Operation Overlord|Battle of Normandy]] in 1944.]]\nThe influence of air forces over forces on the ground changed significantly over the course of the Second World War. Early German successes were conducted when Allied aircraft could not make a significant impact on the battlefield. In May 1940, there was near parity in numbers of aircraft between the ''Luftwaffe'' and the Allies, but the ''Luftwaffe'' had been developed to support Germany's ground forces, had liaison officers with the mobile formations, and operated a higher number of sorties per aircraft.{{sfn|Boyne|2002|p=233}} In addition, German air parity or superiority allowed the unencumbered movement of ground forces, their unhindered assembly into concentrated attack formations, aerial reconnaissance, aerial resupply of fast moving formations and close air support at the point of attack.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} The Allied air forces had no close air support aircraft, training or doctrine.{{sfn|Boyne|2002|p=233|loc=Excerpt reads: \"The Allies had no CAS aircraft, training or doctrine.}} The Allies flew 434 French and 160 British sorties a day but methods of attacking ground targets had yet to be developed; therefore Allied aircraft caused negligible damage. Against these 600 sorties the ''Luftwaffe'' on average flew 1,500 sorties a day.{{sfn|Dildy|2014|p=36}} On May 13, ''Fliegerkorps'' VIII flew 1,000 sorties in support of the crossing of the Meuse. The following day the Allies made repeated attempts to destroy the German pontoon bridges, but German fighter aircraft, ground fire and ''Luftwaffe'' flak batteries with the panzer forces destroyed 56 percent of the attacking Allied aircraft while the bridges remained intact.{{sfn|Terraine|1998|pp=133\u2013135}}\n\nAllied air superiority became a significant hindrance to German operations during the later years of the war. By June 1944 the Western Allies had complete control of the air over the battlefield and their fighter-bomber aircraft were very effective at attacking ground forces. On D-Day the Allies flew 14,500 sorties over the battlefield area alone, not including sorties flown over north-western Europe. Against this on 6 June the ''Luftwaffe'' flew some 300 sorties. Though German fighter presence over Normandy increased over the next days and weeks, it never approached the numbers the Allies commanded. Fighter-bomber attacks on German formations made movement during daylight almost impossible. Subsequently, shortages soon developed in food, fuel and ammunition, severely hampering the German defenders. German vehicle crews and even flak units experienced great difficulty moving during daylight.{{sfn|Willmott|1984|pp=94, 89|loc=Excerpt reads: \"Many examples of the experiences and losses suffered by German formations moving up to the front are well known. Panzer Lehr, for instance, on 7 June alone lost 84 half-tracks, prime movers and self propelled guns, 40 fuel bowsers, 90 soft-skinned vehicles and five tanks as it made its way from Le Mans to Caen.}} Indeed, the final German offensive operation in the west, [[Operation Wacht am Rhein]], was planned to take place during poor weather to minimize interference by Allied aircraft. Under these conditions it was difficult for German commanders to employ the \"armoured idea\", if at all.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n===Counter-tactics===\nBlitzkrieg is vulnerable to an enemy that is robust enough to weather the shock of the attack and that does not panic at the idea of enemy formations in its rear area.  This is especially true if the attacking formation lacks the reserve to keep funnelling forces into the spearhead, or lacks the mobility to provide infantry, artillery and supplies into the attack.  If the defender can hold the shoulders of the breach they will have the opportunity to counter-attack into the flank of the attacker, potentially cutting off the van as happened to [[Joachim Peiper#The Battle of the Bulge|Kampfgruppe Peiper]] in the Ardennes.\n\nDuring the Battle of France in 1940, the [[4th Armored Division (France, 1940)|4th Armoured Division]] (Major-General Charles de Gaulle) and elements of the 1st Army Tank Brigade [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|(British Expeditionary Force)]] made probing attacks on the German flank, pushing into the rear of the advancing armoured columns at times. This may have been a reason for Hitler to call a halt to the German advance. Those attacks combined with [[Maxime Weygand]]'s [[Hedgehog tactic]] would become the major basis for responding to blitzkrieg attacks in the future: [[Defence in depth|deployment in depth]], permitting enemy or \"shoulders\" of a penetration was essential to channelling the enemy attack, and artillery, properly employed at the shoulders, could take a heavy toll of attackers. While Allied forces in 1940 lacked the experience to successfully develop these strategies, resulting in France's capitulation with heavy losses, they characterised later Allied operations. At the [[Battle of Kursk]] the Red Army employed a combination of defence in great depth, extensive minefields, and tenacious defence of breakthrough shoulders. In this way they depleted German combat power even as German forces advanced.{{citation needed|date= July 2013 |reason= invalid ref: Holmes not found in bibliography}} The reverse can be seen in the Russian summer offensive of 1944, [[Operation Bagration]], which resulted in the destruction of Army Group Center. German attempts to weather the storm and fight out of encirclements failed due to the Russian ability to continue to feed armoured units into the attack, maintaining the mobility and strength of the offensive, arriving in force deep in the rear areas, faster than the Germans could regroup.\n\n<!--In August 1944 at Mortain, stout defence and counterattacks against the German flanks by American and Canadian forces closed the [[Falaise pocket]].{{citation needed|date= July 2013 |reason= invalid ref: Holmes not found in bibliography}} In the Ardennes, determined defenders in a combination of hedgehog defence at [[Battle of Bastogne|Bastogne]], [[Battle of St. Vith|St Vith]] and other locations, and a counter-attack by [[George S.

Strategies based on manoeuvre have the inherent danger of the attacking force overextending its [[supply line]]s, and can be defeated by a determined foe who is willing and able to sacrifice territory for time in which to regroup and rearm, as the Soviets did on the Eastern Front (as opposed to, for example, the Dutch who had no territory to sacrifice). Tank and vehicle production was a constant problem for Germany; indeed, late in the war many panzer \"divisions\" had no more than a few dozen tanks.{{sfn|Simpkin|2000|p=34}} As the end of the war approached, Germany also experienced critical shortages in [[fuel]] and [[ammunition]] stocks as a result of Anglo-American [[strategic bombing]] and blockade. Although production of ''Luftwaffe'' fighter aircraft continued, they would be unable to fly for lack of fuel. What fuel there was went to panzer divisions, and even then they were not able to operate normally. Of those [[Tiger I|Tiger]] tanks lost against the United States Army, nearly half of them were abandoned for lack of fuel.{{sfn|Winchester|2002|pp=18\u201325}}\n\n==Military operations==\n\n===Spanish Civil War===\nGerman volunteers first used armour in live field conditions during the [[Spanish Civil War]] of 1936. Armour commitment consisted of Panzer Battalion 88, a force built around three companies of [[Panzer I]] tanks that functioned as a training cadre for Nationalists. The Luftwaffe deployed squadrons of [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]], dive bombers and [[Military transport aircraft|transport aircraft]] as the ''[[Condor Legion]]''.{{sfn|Edwards|1989|p=145}} Guderian said that the tank deployment was \"on too small a scale to allow accurate assessments to be made.\"{{sfn|Edwards|1989|p=25}} The true test of his \"armoured idea\" would have to wait for the Second World War. However, the ''Luftwaffe'' also provided volunteers to Spain to test both tactics and aircraft in combat, including the first combat use of the ''Stuka''.\n\nDuring the war, the ''Condor Legion'' undertook the [[bombing of Guernica]] which had a tremendous psychological effect on the populations of Europe. The results were exaggerated, and the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]] concluded that the \"city-busting\" techniques were now a part of the German way in war. The targets of the German aircraft were actually the rail lines and bridges. But lacking the ability to hit them with accuracy (only three or four [[Ju 87]]s saw action in Spain), a method of [[carpet bombing]] was chosen resulting in heavy civilian casualties.{{sfn|Corum|1997|p=200}}\n\n===Poland, 1939===\n{{Main article|Invasion of Poland}}\n\n[[File:Poland2.jpg|thumb|alt=A map of Poland showing the German invasion from east Germany, East Prussia and German-occupied Czechoslovakia in September 1939|In Poland, fast moving armies encircled Polish forces (blue circles) but not by independent armoured operations.

Harris have written that German operations during it were consistent with traditional methods. The Wehrmacht strategy was more in line with ''[[Vernichtungsgedanke]]n'' a focus on envelopment to create pockets in broad-front annihilation. Panzer forces were dispersed among the three German concentrations with little emphasis on independent use, being used to create or destroy close pockets of [[Polish Army|Polish forces]] and seize operational-depth terrain in support of the largely un-motorized infantry which followed.{{sfn|Harris|1995|p=339}}\n\nWhile early German tanks, Stuka dive-bombers and concentrated forces were used in the Polish campaign, the majority of the battle was conventional infantry and artillery warfare and most Luftwaffe action was independent of the ground campaign. Matthew Cooper wrote that\n\n{{quote|[t]hroughout the Polish Campaign, the employment of the mechanised units revealed the idea that they were intended solely to ease the advance and to support the activities of the infantry....Thus, any strategic exploitation of the armoured idea was still-born.

German ground and air forces, and were only incidental by-products of the traditional maneuvers of rapid encirclement and of the supporting activities of the flying artillery of the Luftwaffe, both of which had as their purpose the physical destruction of the enemy troops. Such was the ''Vernichtungsgedanke'' of the Polish campaign.{{sfn|Cooper|1997|p=176}}}}\n\nJohn Ellis wrote that \"...there is considerable justice in Matthew Cooper's assertion that the panzer divisions were not given the kind of ''strategic'' mission that was to characterize authentic armoured blitzkrieg, and were almost always closely subordinated to the various mass infantry armies.\"{{sfn|Ellis|1990|p=}} [[Steven Zaloga]] wrote, \"Whilst Western accounts of the September campaign have stressed the shock value of the panzer and Stuka attacks, they have tended to underestimate the punishing effect of German artillery on Polish units.

Yellow opened with a feint conducted against the Netherlands and Belgium by two armoured corps and [[paratrooper]]s. Most of the German armoured forces were placed in Panzer Group von Kleist, which attacked through the [[Ardennes]], a lightly defended sector that the French planned to reinforce if need be, before the Germans could bring up heavy and siege artillery.{{sfn|Liddell Hart|1970|p=73}}{{efn|name=Alphonse Joseph Georges statement}} There was no time for such a reinforcement to be sent, for the Germans did not wait for siege artillery but reached the Meuse and achieved a breakthrough at the [[Battle of Sedan (1940)|Battle of Sedan]] in three days.{{sfn|Frieser|2005|pp=145\u2013182}}\n\nThe group raced to the [[English Channel]], reaching the coast at Abbeville and cut off the BEF, the [[Belgian Army]] and some of the best-equipped divisions of the [[French Army]] in northern France. Armoured and motorised units under Guderian, Rommel and others, advanced far beyond the marching and horse-drawn infantry divisions and far in excess of that with which Hitler and the German high command expected or wished. When the Allies counter-attacked at [[Battle of Arras (1940)|Arras]] using the heavily armoured British [[Matilda I (tank)|Matilda I]] and [[Matilda II]] tanks, a brief panic was created in the German High Command. The armoured and motorised forces were halted by Hitler outside the port of [[Dunkirk]], which was being used to evacuate the Allied forces. [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] promised that the Luftwaffe would complete the destruction of the encircled armies but aerial operations failed to prevent the evacuation of the majority of the Allied troops.

With much of their own armour and heavy equipment lost in Northern France, they lacked the means to fight a mobile war. The Germans followed their initial success with Operation Red, a triple-pronged offensive. The XV Panzer Corps attacked towards [[Brest, France|Brest]], [[XIV Panzer Corps]] attacked east of Paris, towards [[Lyon]] and the XIX Panzer Corps encircled the Maginot Line. The French were hard pressed to organise any sort of counter-attack and were continually ordered to form new defensive lines and found that German forces had already by-passed them and moved on. An armoured counter-attack organised by Colonel de Gaulle could not be sustained and he had to retreat.\n\nPrior to the German offensive in May, Winston Churchill had said \"Thank God for the French Army\".{{sfn|Horne|1969|p=717}} That same French army collapsed after barely two months of fighting. This was in shocking contrast to the four years of trench warfare they had engaged in during the First World War.

These artillery-based tactics were also decisive in Western Front operations after [[Operation Overlord]] and the British Commonwealth and American armies developed flexible and powerful systems for using artillery support.

There has been a great deal of debate about whether it existed as a coherent military strategy. Many historians{{who|date=August 2015}} now think that blitzkrieg was not a military theory and the campaigns conducted by the Germans from 1939 to [[circa]] 1942 (with the exception of Operation Barbarossa) were improvised, rather than being based on a particular military strategy. Blitzkrieg had been called a [[Revolution in Military Affairs]] (RMA) but many writers and historians have concluded that the Germans did not invent a new form of warfare but applied new technologies to traditional ideas of ''Bewegungskrieg'' (manoeuvre warfare) to achieve decisive victory.{{sfn|Citino|2005|p=311}}\n\n===Strategy===\nIn 1965, [[Captain (land)|Captain]] [[Robert J. O'Neill|Robert O'Neill]], Professor of the History of War at the [[Oxford University]] produced an example of the popular view. In ''Doctrine and Training in the German Army 1919\u20131939'', O'Neill wrote\n\n{{quote|What makes this story worth telling is the development of one idea: the blitzkrieg. The German Army had a greater grasp of the effects of technology on the battlefield, and went on to develop a new form of warfare by which its rivals when it came to the test were hopelessly outclassed.}}\n\nOther historians wrote that blitzkrieg was an operational doctrine of the German armed forces and a strategic concept on which the leadership of the ''[[Third Reich]]'' based its strategic and economic planning. Military planners and bureaucrats in the war economy appear rarely, if ever, to have employed the term ''blitzkrieg'' in official documents. That the German army had a \"blitzkrieg doctrine\" was rejected in the late 1970s by Matthew Cooper. The concept of a blitzkrieg ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' was challenged by [[Richard Overy]] in the late 1970s and by Williamson Murray in the mid-1980s. That the ''Third Reich'' went to war on the basis of \"blitzkrieg economics\" was criticised by Richard Overy in the 1980s and George Raudzens described the contradictory senses in which historians have used the word. The notion of a German blitzkrieg concept or doctrine survives in popular history and many historians still support the thesis.{{sfn|Harris|1995|pp=333\u2013348}}\n\nFrieser wrote that after the failure of the [[Schlieffen Plan]] in 1914, the German army concluded that decisive battles were no longer possible in the changed conditions of the twentieth century. Frieser wrote that the [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht]] (OKW), which was created in 1938 had intended to avoid the decisive battle concepts of its predecessors and planned for a long war of exhaustion (''ermattungskrieg''). It was only after the improvised plan for the Battle of France in 1940 was unexpectedly successful, that the German General Staff came to believe that ''vernichtungskrieg'' was still feasible. German thinking reverted to the possibility of a quick and decisive war for the [[Balkans Campaign (World War II)|Balkan Campaign]] and Operation Barbarossa.{{sfn|Frieser|2005|pp=349\u2013350}}\n\n===Doctrine===\nMost academic historians regard the notion of blitzkrieg as military doctrine to be a myth. [[Shimon Naveh]] wrote \"The striking feature of the blitzkrieg concept is the complete absence of a coherent theory which should have served as the general cognitive basis for the actual conduct of operations\". Naveh described it as an \"ad hoc solution\" to operational dangers, thrown together at the last moment.{{sfn|Naveh|1997|pp=128\u2013129}} Overy disagreed with the idea that Hitler and the Nazi regime ever intended a blitzkrieg war, because the once popular belief that the Nazi state organised their economy to carry out its grand strategy in short campaigns was false. Hitler had intended for a rapid unlimited war to occur much later than 1939, but the ''Third Reich's'' aggressive [[foreign policy]] forced the Nazi state into war before it was ready. Hitler and the ''[[Wehrmacht]]'s'' planning in the 1930s did not reflect a blitzkrieg method but the opposite.{{sfn|Overy|1995|pp=233\u2013235}} John Harris wrote that the Wehrmacht never used the word, and it did not appear in German army or air force field manuals; the word was coined in September 1939, by a ''Times'' newspaper reporter. Harris also found no evidence that German military thinking developed a blitzkrieg mentality.{{sfn|Harris|1995|pp=333\u2013336}} [[Karl-Heinz Frieser]] and [[Adam Tooze]] reached similar conclusions to Overy and Naveh, that the notions of blitzkrieg-economy and strategy were myths.{{sfn|Frieser|2005|pp=25\u201327}}{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=371\u2013373}} Frieser wrote that surviving German economists and General Staff officers denied that Germany went to war with a blitzkrieg strategy.{{sfn|Frieser|2005|p=}} [[Robert M.

Milward described an economy positioned between a full war economy and a peacetime economy.{{sfn|Frieser|2005|p=25}}{{sfn|Harris|1995|p=348}} The purpose of the blitzkrieg economy was to allow the German people to enjoy high living standards in the event of hostilities and avoid the economic hardships of the First World War.{{sfn|Overy|1995|p=260}}\n\nOvery wrote that blitzkrieg as a \"coherent military and economic concept has proven a difficult strategy to defend in light of the evidence\".{{sfn|Overy|1995|p=207}} Milward's theory was contrary to Hitler's and German planners' intentions. The Germans, aware of the errors of the First World War, rejected the concept of organising its economy to fight only a short war. Therefore, focus was given to the development of armament in depth for a long war, instead of armament in breadth for a short war. Hitler claimed that relying on surprise alone was \"criminal\" and that \"we have to prepare for a long war along with surprise attack\". During the winter of 1939\u201340, Hitler demobilised many troops from the army to return as skilled workers to factories because the war would be decided by production, not a quick \"Panzer operation\".{{sfn|Frieser|2005|p=26}}\n\nIn the 1930s, Hitler had ordered rearmament programs that cannot be considered limited. In November 1937 Hitler had indicated that most of the armament projects would be completed by 1943\u201345.{{sfn|Overy|1995|pp=192, 195}} The rearmament of the ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' was to have been completed in 1949 and the ''Luftwaffe'' rearmament program was to have matured in 1942, with a force capable of strategic bombing with [[heavy bomber]]s. The construction and training of motorised forces and a full mobilisation of the rail networks would not begin until 1943 and 1944 respectively.{{sfn|Frieser|2005|p=29}} Hitler needed to avoid war until these projects were complete but his misjudgements in 1939 forced Germany into war before rearmament was complete.{{sfn|Overy|1995|p=195}}\n\nAfter the war, [[Albert Speer]] claimed that the German economy achieved greater armaments output, not because of diversions of capacity from civilian to military industry but through streamlining of the economy. Richard Overy pointed out some 23 percent of German output was military by 1939. Between 1937 and 1939, 70 percent of investment capital went into the rubber, synthetic fuel, aircraft and shipbuilding industries. Hermann G\u00f6ring had consistently stated that the task of the [[Four Year Plan]] was to rearm Germany for total war. Hitler's correspondence with his economists also reveals that his intent was to wage war in 1943\u20131945, when the resources of central Europe had been absorbed into the ''Third Reich''.{{sfn|Overy|1995|pp=259, 263}}\n\nLiving standards were not high in the late 1930s. Consumption of consumer goods had fallen from 71 percent in 1928 to 59 percent in 1938. The demands of the war economy reduced the amount of spending in non-military sectors to satisfy the demand for the armed forces. On 9 September, G\u00f6ring as Head of the ''Reich Defence Council'', called for complete \"employment\" of living and fighting power of the national economy for the duration of the war. Overy presents this as evidence that a \"blitzkrieg economy\" did not exist.{{sfn|Overy|1995|pp=261, 265}}\n\nAdam Tooze wrote that the German economy was being prepared for a long war. The expenditure for this war was extensive and put the economy under severe strain. The German leadership were concerned less with how to balance the civilian economy and the needs of civilian consumption but to figure out how to best prepare the economy for total war. Once war had begun, Hitler urged his economic experts to abandon caution and expend all available resources on the war effort but the expansion plans only gradually gained momentum in 1941. Tooze wrote that the huge armament plans in the pre-war period did not indicate any clear-sighted blitzkrieg economy or strategy.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=335, 338, 372}}\n\n===''Heer''===\nFrieser wrote that the {{lang|de|[[German Army (Wehrmacht)|Heer]]}} ({{IPA-de|\u02c8he\u02d0\u0250\u032f}}){{efn|name=Heer}} was not ready for blitzkrieg at the start of the war. A blitzkrieg method called for a young, highly skilled mechanised army. In 1939\u201340, 45 percent of the army was 40 years old and 50 percent of the soldiers had only a few weeks' training. The German army, contrary to the blitzkrieg legend, was not fully motorised and had only 120,000 vehicles, compared to the 300,000 of the French Army. The British also had an \"enviable\" contingent of motorised forces. Thus, \"the image of the German 'Blitzkrieg' army is a figment of propaganda imagination\". During the First World War the German army used 1.4 million horses for transport and in the Second World War used 2.7 million horses; only ten percent of the army was motorised in 1940.{{sfn|Frieser|2005|p=29}}\n\nHalf of the German divisions available in 1940 were combat ready but less well-equipped than the British and French or the Imperial German Army of 1914. In the spring of 1940, the German army was semi-modern, in which a small number of  well-equipped and \"elite\" divisions were offset by many second and third rate divisions\".{{sfn|Frieser|2005|pp=29\u201330, 33}} In 2003, John Mosier wrote that while the French soldiers in 1940 were better trained than German soldiers, as were the Americans later and that the German army was the least mechanised of the major armies, its leadership cadres were larger and better and that the high standard of leadership was the main reason for the successes of the German army in World War II, as it had been in World War I.{{sfn|Mosier|2003|pp=284\u2013288}}\n\n===''Luftwaffe''===\n[[James Corum]] wrote that it was a myth that the ''Luftwaffe'' had a doctrine of [[terror bombing]], in which civilians were attacked to break the will or aid the collapse of an enemy, by the ''Luftwaffe'' in ''Blitzkrieg'' operations. After the bombing of Guernica in 1937 and the [[Rotterdam Blitz]] in 1940, it was commonly assumed that terror bombing was a part of ''Luftwaffe'' doctrine. During the interwar period the ''Luftwaffe'' leadership rejected the concept of terror bombing in favour of battlefield support and [[interdiction]] operations.{{sfn|Corum|1997|p=7}}\n\n{{quote|The vital industries and transportation centers that would be targeted for shutdown were valid military targets. Civilians were not to be targeted directly, but the breakdown of production would affect their morale and will to fight. German legal scholars of the 1930s carefully worked out guidelines for what type of bombing was permissible under international law. While direct attacks against civilians were ruled out as \"terror bombing\", the concept of the attacking the vital war industries \u2013 and probable heavy civilian casualties and breakdown of civilian morale \u2013 was ruled as acceptable.{{sfn|Corum|1997|p=240}}}}\n\nCorum continues: [[General]] [[Walther Wever (general)|Walther Wever]] compiled a doctrine known as ''The Conduct of the Aerial War''. This document, which the ''Luftwaffe'' adopted, rejected [[Giulio Douhet]]'s theory of terror bombing. Terror bombing was deemed to be \"counter-productive\", increasing rather than destroying the enemy's will to resist. Such bombing campaigns were regarded as diversion from the ''Luftwaffe's'' main operations; destruction of the enemy armed forces. The bombings of Guernica, Rotterdam and [[Bombing of Warsaw in World War II|Warsaw]] were tactical missions in support of military operations and were not intended as strategic terror attacks.{{sfn|Corum|1997|pp=143\u2013144, 146, 7}}\n\nJ. P. Harris wrote that most Luftwaffe leaders from Goering through the general staff believed (as did their counterparts in Britain and the United States) that strategic bombing was the chief mission of the air force and that given such a role, the Luftwaffe would win the next war and that\n\n{{quote|Nearly all lectures concerned the strategic uses of airpower; virtually none discussed tactical co-operation with the Army. Similarly in the military journals, emphasis centred on 'strategic\u2019 bombing. The prestigious Milit\u00e4rwissenschaftliche Rundeschau, the War Ministry's journal, which was founded in 1936, published a number of theoretical pieces on future developments in air warfare. Nearly all discussed the use of strategic airpower, some emphasising that aspect of air warfare to the exclusion of others. One author commented that European military powers were increasingly making the bomber force the heart of their airpower. The manoeuvrability and technical capability of the next generation of bombers would be \u2019as unstoppable as the flight of a shell.{{sfn|Harris|1995|p=346}}}}\n\nThe Luftwaffe did end up with an air force consisting mainly of relatively short-range aircraft, but this does not prove that the German air force was solely interested in \u2019tactical\u2019 bombing. It happened because the German aircraft industry lacked the experience to build a long-range bomber fleet quickly, and because Hitler was insistent on the very rapid creation of a numerically large force. It is also significant that Germany's position in the centre of Europe to a large extent obviated the need to make a clear distinction between bombers suitable only for \u2019tactical\u2019 and those necessary for strategic purposes in the early stages of a likely future war.{{sfn|Harris|1995|pp=346\u2013347}}\n\n===Fuller and Liddell Hart===\nBritish theorists [[John Frederick Charles Fuller]] and Captain [[Basil Henry Liddell Hart]] have often been associated with the development of blitzkrieg, though this is a matter of controversy. In recent years historians have uncovered that Liddell Hart distorted and falsified facts to make it appear as if his ideas were adopted. After the war Liddell Hart imposed his own perceptions, after the event, claiming that the mobile tank warfare practised by the ''Wehrmacht'' was a result of his influence.{{sfn|Naveh|1997|p=108}} By manipulation and contrivance, Liddell Hart distorted the actual circumstances of the blitzkrieg formation, and he obscured its origins. Through his indoctrinated idealisation of an ostentatious concept, he reinforced the myth of blitzkrieg. By imposing, retrospectively, his own perceptions of mobile warfare upon the shallow concept of blitzkrieg, he \"created a theoretical imbroglio that has taken 40 years to unravel.\"{{sfn|Naveh|1997|pp=108\u2013109}} Blitzkrieg was not an official doctrine and historians in recent times have come to the conclusion that it did not exist as such.{{efn|name=misconception of blitzkrieg}}\n\n{{quote|It was the opposite of a doctrine. Blitzkrieg consisted of an avalanche of actions that were sorted out less by design and more by success. In hindsight\u2014and with some help from Liddell Hart\u2014this torrent of action was squeezed into something it never was: an operational design.{{sfn|Paret|Craig|Gilbert|1986|p=585}}{{sfn|Naveh|1997|p=108}}}}\n\nThe early 1950s literature transformed blitzkrieg into a historical military doctrine, which carried the signature of Liddell Hart and Guderian. The main evidence of Liddell Hart's deceit and \"tendentious\" report of history can be found in his letters to [[Erich von Manstein]], Heinz Guderian and the relatives and associates of [[Erwin Rommel]]. Liddell Hart, in letters to Guderian, \"imposed his own fabricated version of blitzkrieg on the latter and compelled him to proclaim it as original formula\".{{sfn|Naveh|1997|p=109}}{{sfn|Danchev|1998|p=239}} [[Kenneth Macksey]] found Liddell Hart's original letters to Guderian in the General's papers, requesting that Guderian give him credit for \"impressing him\" with his ideas of armoured warfare. When Liddell Hart was questioned about this in 1968 and the discrepancy between the English and German editions of Guderian's memoirs, \"he gave a conveniently unhelpful though strictly truthful reply. ('There is nothing about the matter in my file of correspondence with Guderian himself except...that I thanked him...for what he said in that additional paragraph'.)\".{{sfn|Danchev|1998|pp=235\u2013239}}\n\nDuring World War I, Fuller had been a staff officer attached to the [[Royal Tank Regiment|new tank corps]]. He developed [[Plan 1919]] for massive, independent tank operations, which he claimed were subsequently studied by the German military. It is variously argued that Fuller's wartime plans and post-war writings were an inspiration or that his readership was low and German experiences during the war received more attention. The German view of themselves as the losers of the war, may be linked to the senior and experienced officers' undertaking a thorough review, studying and rewriting of all their Army doctrine and training manuals.{{sfn|Corum|1992|p=39}}\n\nFuller and Liddell Hart were \"outsiders\": Liddell Hart was unable to serve as a soldier after 1916 after being gassed on the Somme and Fuller's abrasive personality resulted in his premature retirement in 1933.{{sfn|Harris|1995a|p=244}} Their views had limited impact in the British army; the War Office permitted the formation of an [[Experimental Mechanized Force]] on 1 May 1927, composed of tanks, [[Truck|lorried]] infantry, [[Birch gun|self-propelled artillery]] and motorised engineers but the force was disbanded in 1928 on the grounds that it had served its purpose. A new experimental brigade was intended for the next year and became a permanent formation in 1933, during the cuts of the {{nowrap|1932/33\u20131934/35}} financial years.{{sfn|Harris|1995a|pp=197, 210\u2013219, 220\u2013221, 237}}\n\n===Continuity===\nIt has been argued that blitzkrieg was not new; the Germans did not invent something called blitzkrieg in the 1920s and 1930s.{{sfn|Citino|2005|p=311}}{{sfn|Frieser|2005|pp=326\u2013328}} Rather the German concept of wars of movement and concentrated force were seen in wars of [[Prussia]] and the [[Unification of Germany|German wars of unification]]. The first European general to introduce rapid movement, concentrated power and integrated military effort was Swedish King [[Gustavus Adolphus]] during the [[Thirty Years' War]]. The appearance of the aircraft and tank in the First World War, called an RMA, offered the German military a chance to get back to the traditional war of movement as practised by [[Moltke the Elder]]. The so-called \"blitzkrieg campaigns\" of 1939 \u2013 circa 1942, were well within that operational context.{{sfn|Citino|2005|p=311}}\n\nAt the outbreak of war, the German army had no radically new theory of war. The operational thinking of the German army had not changed significantly since the First World War or since the late 19th century. J. P. Harris and [[Robert M. Citino]] point out that the Germans had always had a marked preference for short, decisive campaigns \u2013 but were unable to achieve short-order victories in First World War conditions. The transformation from the stalemate of the First World War into tremendous initial operational and strategic success in the Second, was partly the employment of a relatively small number of mechanised divisions, most importantly the Panzer divisions, and the support of an exceptionally powerful [[air force]].{{sfn|Harris|1995|pp=344\u2013345}}\n\n===Guderian===\nHeinz Guderian is widely regarded as being highly influential in developing the military methods of warfare used by Germany's tank men at the start of the Second World War. This style of warfare brought manoeuvre back to the fore, and placed an emphasis on the offensive.  This style, along with the shockingly rapid collapse in the armies that opposed it, came to be branded as blitzkrieg warfare.{{sfn|Frieser|2005|p=7}}\n\nFollowing Germany's military reforms of the 1920s, Heinz Guderian emerged as a strong proponent of mechanised forces. Within the Inspectorate of Transport Troops, Guderian and colleagues performed theoretical and field exercise work. Guderian met with opposition from some in the General Staff, who were distrustful of the new weapons and who continued to view the infantry as the primary weapon of the army. Among them, Guderian claimed, was Chief of the General Staff [[Ludwig Beck]] (1935\u201338), whom he alleged was sceptical that armoured forces could be decisive. This claim has been disputed by later historians. James Corum wrote:\n\n{{quote|Guderian expressed a hearty contempt for General Ludwig Beck, chief of the General Staff from 1935 to 1938, whom he characterized as hostile to ideas of modern mechanised warfare: [Corum quoting Guderian] \"He [Beck] was a paralysing element wherever he appeared....[S]ignificantly of his way of thought was his much-boosted method of fighting which he called delaying defence\". This is a crude caricature of a highly competent general who authored Army Regulation 300 (Troop Leadership) in 1933, the primary tactical manual of the German Army in World War II, and under whose direction the first three panzer divisions were created in 1935, the largest such force in the world of the time.{{sfn|Corum|1992|pp=140\u2013141}}}}\n\nBy Guderian's account he single-handedly created the German tactical and operational methodology. Between 1922 and 1928 Guderian wrote a number of articles concerning military movement. As the ideas of making use of the combustible engine in a protected encasement to bring mobility back to warfare developed in the German army, Guderian was a  leading proponent of the formations that would be used for this purpose.  He was later asked to write an explanatory book, which was titled ''Achtung Panzer!'' (1937).  In it he explained the theories of the tank men and defended them.\n\nGuderian argued that the tank would be the decisive weapon of the next war. \"If the tanks succeed, then victory follows\", he wrote. In an article addressed to critics of tank warfare, he wrote \"until our critics can produce some new and better method of making a successful land attack other than self-massacre, we shall continue to maintain our beliefs that tanks\u2014properly employed, needless to say\u2014are today the best means available for land attack.\" Addressing the faster rate at which defenders could reinforce an area than attackers could penetrate it during the First World War, Guderian wrote that \"since reserve forces will now be motorized, the building up of new defensive fronts is easier than it used to be; the chances of an offensive based on the timetable of artillery and infantry co-operation are, as a result, even slighter today than they were in the last war.\" He continued, \"We believe that by attacking with tanks we can achieve a higher rate of movement than has been hitherto obtainable, and\u2014what is perhaps even more important\u2014that we can keep moving once a breakthrough has been made.\"{{sfn|Guderian|2001|pp=39\u201346|loc=Guderian's remarks are from an unnamed article published in the National Union of German Officers, 15 October 1937 as quoted in ''Panzer Leader'', pp.39\u201346. Italics removed\u2014the quoted sections are all italics in the original.}} Guderian additionally required that tactical radios be widely used to facilitate co-ordination and command by having one installed in all tanks.\n\nGuderian's leadership was supported, fostered and institutionalised by his supporters in the Reichswehr General Staff system, which worked the Army to greater and greater levels of capability through massive and systematic Movement Warfare war games in the 1930s. Guderian's book incorporated the work of theorists such as Ludwig Ritter von Eimannsberger, whose book, ''The Tank War'' (''Der Kampfwagenkrieg'') (1934) gained a wide audience in the German army. Another German theorist, Ernst Volckheim, wrote a huge amount on tank and combined arms tactics and was influential to German thinking on the use of armoured formations but his work was not acknowledged in Guderian's writings.{{sfn|Corum|1992|p=139}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[AirLand Battle]], blitzkrieg-like doctrine of US Army in 1980s\n* [[Armored warfare]]\n* [[Maneuver warfare]]\n* [[Rush (computer and video games)]], an RTS strategy influenced by the blitzkrieg method\n* [[Shock and awe]], the 21st century US military doctrine.\n* ''[[Vernichtungsgedanke]]'', or \"annihilation concept\".\n* [[Mission-type tactics]]\n* [[Deep Battle]], Soviet Red Army Military Doctrine from the 1930s often confused with blitzkrieg.\n* ''[[Battleplan]]'' (documentary TV series)\n* [[Battle of annihilation|''Vernichtungsschlacht'']], Battle of annihilation\n\n==Notes==\n{{notes\n|notes =\n\n{{efn\n|name=misconception of blitzkrieg\n|Some of the historians that have addressed the misconception of the originality and formalisation of blitzkrieg in their works are: Shimon Naveh {{harv|Naveh|1997|pp=107\u2013108}}, John Paret {{harv|Paret|Craig|Gilbert|1986|p=587}}, [[Karl-Heinz Frieser]] {{harv|Frieser|2005|pp=28\u201332}}, Richard Overy {{harv|Overy|1995|pp=233\u2013235}}, [[Mungo Melvin]] {{harv|Melvin|2011|pp=137}}, and Steven Mercatante {{harv|Mercatante|2012|pp=4\u20135}}.\n}}\n\n{{efn\n|name=casual usage of blitzkrieg\n|These are some of the many notable historians that have casually used the term ''blitzkrieg''\u2014including some who have written on its misconception\u2014to describe several Wehrmacht military operations that were spearheaded by a [[force concentration|dense concentration]] of armoured and motorised formations with the aim of delivering a breakthrough, and exploiting it with speed to paralyse and encircle the enemy: David Glantz ({{harvnb|Glantz|2010|p=14}}; {{harvnb|Glantz|2009|p=164}}; {{harvnb|Glantz|2001}}), [[Jonathan House]] ({{harvnb|Glantz|House|1999|pp=254, 269}}; {{harvnb|Glantz|House|1995|pp=61, 125, 167, 226, 274, 286, 288}}), Lloyd Clark {{harv|Clark|2012|pp=22\u201327, 187}}, Antony Beevor ({{harvnb|Beevor|1999|pp=13, 148}}; {{harvnb|Beevor|2006|p=157}}), Mungo Melvin {{harv|Melvin|2011|pp=46, 79\u201380, 199}}, [[John Erickson (historian)|John Erickson]] {{harv|Erickson|2001|pp=558, 567}} and Steven Mercatante {{harv|Mercatante|2012|pp=65, 77, 91, 301}}.\n}}\n\n{{efn\n|name=Nazi crimes against Soviet POWs\n|58 percent of prisoners died through neglect, starvation, or other causes associated with [[Nazi crimes against Soviet POWs]] {{Harv|Glantz|House|1995|p=57}}.\n}}\n\n{{efn\n|name=terror bombing\n|Nothing appeared in Luftwaffe 'doctrine' stipulating \"terror\" as a major operational factor.

The comic first appeared on 30 July 1938,<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.gonedigging.co.uk/blog/2014/07/10/the-beano-a-happy-76th-birthday/|title=The Beano \u2013 a Happy 76th Birthday!|website=gondigging.co.uk}}</ref> and was published weekly. In September 2009, ''The Beano'''s 3,500th issue was published.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://forbiddenplanet.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/beano3500.jpg |title=Cover photo |website=forbiddenplanet.co.uk}}</ref> One of the best selling comics in [[British popular culture]], along with ''[[The Dandy]]'', the weekly circulation of ''The Beano'' in April 1950 was 1,974,072.<ref name=\"Armstrong\"/> ''The Beano'' is currently edited by John Anderson. Each issue is published on a Wednesday, with the issue date being that of the following Saturday. This means Beano will strike 4000 in the summer of 2019.\n\nIts characters include ''[[Dennis the Menace (UK)|Dennis the Menace]]'', ''[[Minnie the Minx]]'', ''[[The Bash Street Kids]]'', ''[[The Numskulls]]'', ''[[Roger the Dodger]]'', ''[[Billy Whizz]]'' and ''[[Tricky Dicky (Topper)|Tricky Dicky]].'' Earlier characters who have been phased out include ''[[Ball Boy (Beano)|Ball Boy]],'' ''[[Ivy the Terrible]]'', ''[[The Three Bears (comic strip)|The Three Bears]]'' and ''[[Pansy Potter]]''. Some old characters, like ''[[Biffo the Bear]]'', ''[[Lord Snooty]]'', ''[[Baby Face Finlayson]]'' and ''[[Little Plum]]'', have more recently made a return as \"funsize\" quarter-page strips.\n\nThe style of ''Beano'' humour has shifted noticeably over the years,<ref> {{citeweb|title=Dennis Without The Menace Bad Idea|work=Bristol Evening Post|url=http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/news/Dennis-menace-bad-idea-says-Beano-illustrator/article-1255822-detail/article.html|accessdate=14 August 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090819132138/http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/news/Dennis-menace-bad-idea-says-Beano-illustrator/article-1255822-detail/article.html|archivedate=19 August 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> though the longstanding tradition of anarchic humour has remained. For decades strips have appeared to glorify immoral behaviour, e.g. pranking/bullying (''Dennis the Menace''), dishonesty (''Roger the Dodger'') and even robbery (''Baby Face Finlayson'' and ''The Three Bears''). Although the readers' sympathies are assumed to be with the miscreants, the latter are very often shown punished for their actions. Recent years have seen a rise in humour involving gross bodily functions, especially flatulence (which would have been taboo in children's comics prior to the 1990s), while depictions of corporal punishment have declined. For example, the literal slipper - \u201cThe Demon Whacker\u201d - (Dennis the Menace's father's instrument of chastisement) has become the name of the local chief of police (Sergeant Slipper).\n\n==History==\n===Founding, expansion===\nIn 1921, D. C. Thomson had first entered the field of boys' story papers with ''[[Adventure (D.C. Thomson)|Adventure]]''. The success of this paper led to five further publications, ''[[The Rover (comics)|The Rover]]'' and ''[[The Wizard (comic)|The Wizard]]'' in 1922, ''[[The Vanguard (comic)|The Vanguard]]'' in 1924, ''[[Skipper (comic)|The Skipper]]'' in 1930 and ''[[Hotspur (comic)|The Hotspur]]'' in 1933. Although ''The Vanguard'' folded in 1926, the others were a great triumph and became known as \"The Big Five\"; they ended Amalgamated Press's near-monopoly of the British comic industry.<ref>Joseph McAleer, ''Popular Reading and Publishing in Britain 1914\u20131950'', Oxford: Clarendon, 1992, {{ISBN|0-19-820329-2}}, pp. 167-68.</ref>\n\nAnother success was the ''Fun Section'' of D. C. Thomson's Scottish weekly newspaper ''[[The Sunday Post]]'', which included the two strips ''[[Oor Wullie]]'' and ''[[The Broons]]'' by lead artist [[Dudley Watkins]], as well as other funnies and various puzzles and adventure stories. This gave [[R. D. Low]], the head of children's publications at D. C. Thomson at the time, the idea to create another Big Five, this time of comics intended for both boys and girls and consisting mainly of 'funnies' and more lighthearted adventure and text stories.<ref>Ian Brown, ''The Edinburgh History of Scottish Literature'' volume 3: ''Modern transformations: New Identities (from 1918)'', Edinburgh University Press, 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-7486-2482-9}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=mP2kap9YfK4C&pg=PA205&dq=R.+D.+Low+Beano+Dandy+Magic&hl=en&ei=LSNRTNvOM4fGsAO1pdC2AQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CDcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=In%201935%2C%20managing%20editor%20RD%20Low%20informed%20comic%20artist%20Dudley%20Watkins%20that%20he%20planned%20to%20introduce%20two%20new&f=false p. 205].</ref> The first of these publications, ''The Dandy'', commenced in 1937 and was followed by ''The Beano'' on 26 July 1938. ''The Beano'' comic takes its name from the [[English language|English]] word ''beano'', a short form of [[bean-feast]], a term for a festive meal, or loosely ''a good time''.<ref>For further discussion of the origin of this word, see [http://www.bicycle-beano.co.uk/beano.html The Meaning Of Beano] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041207034312/http://www.bicycle-beano.co.uk/beano.html |date=7 December 2004 }}</ref> A third paper, ''[[The Magic Comic]]'', aimed at a slightly younger audience, followed in July 1939, but ceased publication in early 1941, due to paper rationing. Wartime shortages also prevented the New Big Five project from being completed.\n\nThe first edition of ''The Beano'' was dated 30 July 1938.<ref name=issuedates>[http://members.tripod.com/britishcomics/comics.html Issue dates of British comics].

D. C. Thomson's other publications also suffered, with the ''[[Oor Wullie]]'' and ''[[The Broons]]'' annuals falling victim to paper and ink shortages. Paper and ink supplies were fully restored shortly after the end of hostilities and weekly publication of ''The Beano'' and ''The Dandy'' resumed in 1949.\n\nThe 3,000th issue of ''The Beano'' was published in January 2000.<ref name=guardian1>{{citeweb|last=Oliver|first=Mark|url=https://www.theguardian.com/netnotes/article/0,6729,451808,00.html|title=Dennis the Menace|website=theguardian.com|date=14 March 2001|accessdate=30 March 2007}}.</ref> ''The Beano'' is now the longest-running weekly comic, since ''The Dandy'' became a fortnightly comic in 2007, and later stopped publlishing in 2013.\n\n''The Beano'''s weekly circulation in April 1950 was 1,974,072; it currently sells slightly over 31,000 copies per week.<ref name=\"Armstrong\">{{citeweb|last=Armstrong|first=Stephen|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/pixar/11766202/Was-Pixars-Inside-Out-inspired-by-The-Beano.html|title=Was Pixar's Inside Out inspired by The Beano?|website=telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=27 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Merchandising===\n[[File:Beano Comic Stamp.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Beano stamp issued by Royal Mail]]\n[[File:Beanoland at Chessington - geograph.org.uk - 681527.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The now-defunct ''Beanoland'' at [[Chessington World of Adventures]] in the UK.]]\n''The Beano'' is so popular that it had its own section of the [[Chessington World of Adventures]] theme park, \"Beanoland\". This opened in 2000 and survived for a [[decade]] before sponsorship was eventually lost. Most of the major Beanoland attractions remain in operation today but have been rethemed as \"Wild Asia\".\n\nOn 19 March 2012 [[Royal Mail]] launched a special stamp collection to celebrate Britain's rich comic book history.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-17421394 |title=Beano's Dennis the Menace on Royal Mail comic stamps |publisher=BBC News |date= 19 March 2012|accessdate=19 March 2012}}</ref> The collection featured ''The Beano'', ''[[The Dandy]]'', ''[[Eagle (comic)|Eagle]]'', ''[[The Topper (comics)|The Topper]]'', ''[[Roy of the Rovers (comic)|Roy of the Rovers]]'', ''[[Bunty]]'', ''[[Buster (comics)|Buster]]'', ''[[Valiant (comics)|Valiant]]'', ''[[Twinkle (comics)|Twinkle]]'' and ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]''.\n\n===Editors===\nThe original editor was George Moonie from 1938\u201359; followed by Harold Cramond from 1959-84.\n\nEuan Kerr was editor from 1984 until he handed over the reins to Alan Digby in early 2006. Digby had been ''Beano'' Chief Sub Editor when Kerr first became editor, and later edited ''[[The Beezer]]''. Kerr has returned to edit ''BeanoMAX'' as of issue 2 (see below). Following the retirement of Kerr, Digby took over as Editor-in-Chief of both titles. Digby retired in 2011, leaving Michael Stirling as the new editor.\n\nThe following editor of ''The Beano'' was Craig Graham, who joined ''The Beano'' once ''The Dandy'' announced its closure. Upon his arrival as editor, he made many changes to ''The Beano''.\n\n===Revamps===\n[[File:Beanologo.png|thumb|right|upright|Beano logo from 1977 to 2016]]\nThe ''Beano'''s first major revamp was in the 50th birthday issue of 1988, when the page number was increased, the comic had a wider paper style, and more colour was used throughout. Another occurred in issue 2,674, dated 16 October 1993, when the whole comic was now printed in full colour, along with some new strips such as ''[[The Numskulls]]'', which had been moved from ''[[The Beezer]]''.\n\nNo major revamps happened from then until 1998, when Dennis's baby sister Bea was born. The logo was rounded and embossed (but later flattened in February 1999), and there were 8 extra pages. Computers were starting to be used for articles and speech bubbles, rather than the usual hand drawn ones.\n\nSince April 2007, ''The Beano'' has had five revamps to help it keep up to date. The first occurred on 7 April 2007. The logo was raised using a heavy black drop shadow, and the body of the lettering and its yellow trim were separated by a subtle 3D groove effect. The website address was looped inside the \"O\". This logo had been used in the Beano Club for one issue in 2006. Two new comic strips were introduced, these being ''[[The Riot Squad (Beano)|The Riot Squad]]'' and ''[[Fred's Bed]]'', reprints from ''[[Hoot (comic)|Hoot]]'' and ''[[The Beezer]]'' and ''[[The Topper (comics)|Topper]]'' respectively. There was a record number of uncredited [[reprint]]s, with the likes of ''[[Ivy the Terrible]]'', ''[[Calamity James]]'', ''[[Les Pretend]]'' also being reprinted. In certain areas of the UK, such as [[Lancashire]], the price was increased to 99p, while elsewhere it remained as 85p.\n\nThe second happened on 27 October 2007. The logo was still grooved, but was now back to the rounded style which it had from 1999 to 2006. It was quite similar to the original rounded logo from 1998, which was flattened the following year.<br>\nThe number of reprint pages was cut from 4 to 2, but more started to appear after about a month. Two new strips were also added, ''[[Johnny Bean from Happy Bunny Green]]'' and ''[[London B412]]''. The price increased to 99p across the whole UK.\n\nThe third was the least major revamp. The background was changed from one colour behind the logo and another behind the Dennis strip to one single colour or a pattern, such as red and black stripes. New fonts were being used on the front cover, and the \"Pocket money price\" logo had been changed to a large \"WOW! 99p\" which was usually placed in the top corners. No new strips were added this time, but the amount of reprints went up to 5, sometimes lowering back to 4 per week, and an extra ''[[Dennis the Menace (UK)|Dennis]]'' strip was added on the inside back two pages.\n\nThe fourth revamp, which happened with the issue dated 18 October 2008 is the most major revamp to date. There was a return of ''[[Billy the Cat and Katie|Billy the Cat]]'' inside, as well as a new ''[[Super School]]'' strip by [[Lew Stringer]]. The price rose to \u00a31.25 per issue. Different characters appear on the 'O' each week in a cleaner and tidier embossed logo. New headline fonts were introduced (CCZoinks), the balloon font was also changed to Cloudsplitter by [[Blambot]]. But the main change was the paper style, which had finally changed from [[newsprint]] to a [[glossy paper]], much in the style of the inside pages of the then companion papers ''[[Dandy Xtreme]]'' and ''[[BeanoMAX]]''. The only difference between these paper styles is the front cover, which was thicker on the ''Dandy Xtreme'' and ''BeanoMAX'', but the same as the pages throughout in the weekly ''Beano''.\n\nAs of late 2010, ''The Beano'' is printed by BGP and the comic is now in an A4 format. A mild revision of style accompanies this with balloon font changed to CCTimeSaleLower, an upper and lower case font and a much larger Beano logo on the cover. The font CCZoinks appears to have less prominence with CreativeBlockBold taking centre stage. The Beano Club was closed down in 2010 and its pages changed to Beano VIP with more online presence. The paper is still glossy, but the paper stock gives it a matte feel. At the start of 2011, the Beano VIP pages were dropped from the comic, but the online features remain.\n\nIn the issue dated 12 October 2011, there was another revamp. The comic was expanded to 36 pages, and the paper stock was made smoother. The ''[[Number 13 (comics)|Number 13]]'' and ''The Germs'' strips returned as reprints. A reader's page was also reintroduced, this time titled the Menace Gallery. After two appearances, this was renamed ''The Treehouse''.\n\nIn the issue dated 28 January 2012, ''The Beano'''s cover changed. The logo was now more like the logo from 1972-1998, but with \"The\" inside the B much like later versions of the logo. The special \"O\"s that had appeared sometimes in the last year were also kept. The first panel of the Dennis & Gnasher strip also appeared on the cover, like from 1972-2008, but the \"This Week In Beanotown\" feature still appeared across the bottom.\n\nIn late 2012, Craig Graham took over as Beano editor and revamped the comic. As a result, two mini-strip pages titled 'Funsize Funnies' were introduced and featured ''[[Simply Smiffy]]'', ''[[Rasher (comics)|Rasher]]'', ''[[Little Plum]]'', ''[[Les Pretend]]'', ''[[Pup Parade]]'', ''[[Baby Face Finlayson]]'' as well as two new strips ''[[Gnash Gnews]]'' and Winston and also introduced artists such as [[Wilbur Dawbarn]] (who took over Billy Whizz from [[Nick Brennan]]), [[Lew Stringer]] (not seen in the Beano since Super School), [[Alexander Matthews]], [[Paul Palmer (comics)|Paul Palmer]] and [[Nigel Auchterlounie]]. Auchterlounie soon took over writing ''Dennis the Menace and Gnasher'' also which had returned to its pre-2009 style with new characters from the 2009 TV series. In January 2013, ''[[Biffo the Bear]]'', ''[[Pansy Potter]]'', ''[[Lord Snooty]]'' and ''[[Gnipper]]'' were added to the Funsize Funnies, introducing Graham Howie to the Beano and being the return of Wayne Thompson. Later that year, two new comic strips were added called ''[[Big Time Charlie]]'' and ''[[Tricky Dicky (comics)|Tricky Dicky]]'' (relaunch of the classic Topper star) and ''[[Stunt Gran]]'', ''[[BamBeanos]]'', ''[[BSK CCTV]]'' joined the Funsize Funnies replacing Gnash Gnews, Pup Parade and Pansy Potter. Puzzle pages frequently appeared in the comic now, with Jamie Smart and Lew Stringer originally drawing the puzzles, and later on other artists such as Steve Beckett and Barrie Appleby.\n\n===Gnashional Menace Day and the 70th birthday===\nAs a celebration, in partnership with the [[CLIC Sargent]] charity, 2 August 2008 was Gnashional Menace Day, where children were sponsored to behave like Dennis. The anniversary was also celebrated with a 40-page issue (instead of 32 pages; the 60th birthday issue also had extra pages, 48 instead of 24) guest edited by ''[[Wallace and Gromit]]'' creator [[Nick Park]],<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/jul/21/pressandpublishing.animation Gromit creator revels in having a bash at the Beano], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 21 July 2008</ref> price \u00a31.50<ref>{{citweb|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/article1492902.ece|location=London|work=The Sun|first=Martin|last=Phillips|title=Cripes!

There is also a special 64-page book available, ''The Beano Special Collectors Edition: 70 Years of Fun'', giving a brief history of the comic. In the Beano's home city of [[Dundee]], a special exhibition was held at the [[University of Dundee]] featuring original artwork and other memorabilia loaned from D.C. Thomson - it ran until 20 September 2008.<ref>[http://www.dundee.ac.uk/museum/beano.htm Happy Birthday Beano!], the University of Dundee Museum Collections</ref> In London the Cartoon Museum showed the exhibition ''Beano and Dandy Birthday Bash!'' from 30 July to 2 November 2008, featuring original artwork from all eight decades of both ''The Beano'' and ''The Dandy'', including work by [[Dudley D. Watkins]], [[David Law]], [[Leo Baxendale]] and [[Ken Reid (comics)|Ken Reid]] as well as [[David Sutherland (comics artist)|David Sutherland]] and many contemporary artists. There were events for children throughout August.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cartoonmuseum.org|title=The Cartoon Museum - Cartoon Museum|website=cartoonmuseum.com|author=Super User}}</ref>\nThere was also a special coffee table book called ''[[The History of The Beano: The Story So Far]]'', published by Waverly Books.\n\n===75th anniversary, changes===\nIn the 75th Anniversary Special, ''The Beano'' had yet another revamp introducing celebrities as regular characters. As a result, all of the Funsize Funnies as well as the two new recently added comic strips ''[[Tricky Dicky (comics)|Tricky Dicky]]'' and ''[[Big Time Charlie]]'' plus the reprinted ''Calamity James'' were all dropped. ''Bananaman'' came out of Geering reprints after being in them for over a year with Wayne Thompson reprising the role of artist after drawing him previously in ''The Dandy'' from 2010-12. ''Roger the Dodger'' was taken over by Jamie Smart and ''Ball Boy'' was taken over by Alexander Matthews and completely relaunched. Nigel Auchterlounie also took over as scriptwriter of ''The Bash Street Kids'' and ''Bananaman'', as well as now both writing and drawing ''The Numskulls'' which itself had had a huge relaunch with one-off celebrities replacing the role of Edd starting with Ant and Dec. \n\n12-year-old artist Zoom Rockman also joined ''The Beano'' in this issue, drawing ''Skanky Pigeon'' which appeared monthly. In the issue after the 75th Anniversary Special, fourteen new comic strips joined ''The Beano'' with twelve of these becoming the new Funsize Funnies stories, all of which are parodies of either a celebrity or television show: ''High School Moozical'', ''Neigh-Bours'', ''Celebrity Believe It or Not'', ''I Pity the School'', ''Murs Attacks'', ''Ashley's Banjo'', ''Coronation Bleat'', ''Jose's Back'', ''Simon's Bowel'', ''Guess Who?'', ''Watch-Hog'' and ''Danny Diddly O'Donoghue'' as well as two new one-page stories to replace ''Tricky Dicky'' and ''Big Time Charlie'': ''El Poco Loco'' and ''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turkeys''.\n\nStu Munro also took over as both puzzle page artist (as he did in ''The Dandy'') and ''The Dandy's Madvertisements'' were brought back with Stu Munro once again drawing them. Since the 75th Anniversary Special revamp, ''The Beano'' has now gained [[Andy Fanton]], [[Stephen Waller]], [[Dean Rankine]], [[Garry Davies]] and [[Rick Eades]] all from ''The Dandy'' and the only original Beano artists that remain in the comic are [[David Sutherland (comics artist)|David Sutherland]], [[Laura Howell]] and [[Nigel Parkinson]] since [[Barrie Appleby]], [[Barry Glennard]], [[Hunt Emerson]] and [[Dave Eastbury]] all appear to have gone.\n\n==Strips==\n{{further|List of Beano comic strips}}\nA number of strips in the comic have run for a very long time. The top five longest running Beano comic strips are, in descending order, ''Dennis the Menace'', ''Minnie the Minx'', ''Bash Street Kids'', ''Roger the Dodger'', and then the last holder of the title before ''Dennis'', ''Lord Snooty''.\n''Dennis the Menace'''s famous red and black jersey had formed the colours of a few of the ''Beano'' characters' clothes (''Minnie the Minx'' has the same, although the placement of the stripes is a bit different; ''Ball Boy''&apos;s was a vertical red and black; ''Roger the Dodger'' has a chessboard design top, and Danny (from the ''Bash Street Kids'') has a similar cap), but they have changed for ''Minnie'' and ''Ball Boy'' (''Minnie'' at one point had a red and yellow top and ''Ball Boy''&apos;s strip is now black and blue).{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nThere are frequent  [[fictional crossover]]s between ''Beano'' characters, with most of the characters living in the [[fictional]] ''[[Beanotown]]''. Many of the comic strips in ''The Dandy'' are drawn by the same artists, and crossovers between the two comic magazines also occur occasionally. Quite often, one magazine will make a tongue-in-cheek jibe at the other (e.g., a character meeting an elderly lady, and stating that she's \"older than the jokes in ''The Dandy''\"). In the strips, it is expressed that the two towns are rivals with each other and before ''The Dandy'' did a drastic format change they had an embassy in ''Beanotown'' which many of the town's citizens attempted to overrun, but failed (the embassy had no existence in ''The Beano''). This rivalry inspired the spin-off computer game ''[[Beanotown Racing]]'', in which various characters from both comics could be raced around points in ''Beanotown'', including the Embassy. The game was given a large amount of advance publicity in the comics, with storylines often revolving how the characters each acquired his/her vehicle.\n\nOccasionally there are longer than usual strips, for example, a strip of sixteen pages rather than the usual two pages. These longer strips include ''[[The Bash Street Kids]]'' Adventures written and drawn by [[Kev F Sutherland]]<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/herefordandworcester/content/articles/2006/06/13/beano_artist_0807_event_feature.shtml|title=Beano artist in Kidderminster|website=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=6 June 2006}}</ref> which since 2004 have featured parodies of famous comic strip images, including ''[[Amazing Fantasy]]'''s first ''[[Spider-Man]]'' cover, [[Action Comics]]' first ''[[Superman]]'' cover, and most recently the cover of ''[[X-Men]]'' No. 100{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}.\n\n===Reader polls===\nDuring the 1980s, ''The Beano'' ran a 'Readers' Request' feature where readers could request for a particular comic strip to feature in the Beano. This led to the return of dropped characters, including ''[[Little Plum]]'', ''[[Baby Face Finlayson]]'' and ''[[The McTickles]]'', but also led to the introduction of new strips such as ''[[Little Monkey]]''.\n\nReader polls started to appear in the 1990s, allowing the readers to rate the strips in the comic. These polls have been quite influential, as they indicate which strips the readers like best, and strips that have performed poorly in these polls were usually dropped.\n\nOn a number of occasions, the Beano has allowed its readers to vote for which new strips they want to appear in the comic. This usually consists of three new comic strips being run for a number of weeks and the readers can vote on which strips they prefer and the one that receives the most votes stays in the Beano. Readers have been able to cast their votes via telephone, or more recently via the Beano website.\n\nThe first such vote occurred in 1995 with ''[[Vic Volcano]]'' emerging as the winner. In the 1997 competition, two new strips were added permanently, with ''[[Tim Traveller]]'' winning and ''[[Crazy for Daisy]]'' the runner-up. By the early 2000s, these competitions were named Comic Idol (in reference to ''[[Pop Idol]]''). In the 2004 competition, the margin between winner ''[[Joe Jitsu]]'' and runner-up ''[[Colin the Vet]]'' was 1%, so both strips were added to the comic.\n\nThe most recent incarnation in 2010 featured three new strips, ''[[Meebo and Zuky]]'', ''[[Home Invasion]]'', and ''[[Uh oh Si Co!]]''. ''Meebo and Zuky'' won, with ''Home Invasion'' finishing as runner-up, though only ''Meebo and Zuky'' were added to the comic. In 2011, the Dandy did a similar competition where readers voted for their favourite out of four strips, entitled ''Strictly Come Laughing'' (a reference to ''[[Strictly Come Dancing]]'').\n\n==Spin-off comics==\n===Comic libraries===\n{{Main|Fun Size Comics}}\nSince 1982 the comic, along with ''The Dandy'', has also run \"Comic Library\" titles. Released monthly, these titles are a feature length (usually about 64-page) adventure, featuring a character from the comic itself. They are available in A5 size only. In 1998, these were replaced by the ''[[Fun Size Comics|Fun Size Beano]]''. Fun Size Comics were discontinued in late 2010.\n\n===Beano specials===\nThe comic also ran A4-sized ''[[Beano Specials]]'' in 1987 with full coloured pages, which later were replaced by ''[[Beano Superstars]]'' which ran for 121 issues from 1992-2002. These were similar to the Comic Library series. Some of the last issues were printed versions of episodes from the 1996-1998 [[Dennis the Menace and Gnasher (1996 TV series)|''Dennis and Gnasher'' animated TV series]]. A ''Beano Poster Comic'' series was also printed in the early 1990s.\n\nThe Beano Specials returned in 2003, and were now published seasonally. The issues were numbered, and the first one was a Dennis and Friends special, the last a Christmas reprint special. These were replaced by BeanoMAX in early 2007.\n\n===BeanoMAX===\n{{Main|BeanoMAX}}\nOn 15 February 2007, the first issue of a monthly comic entitled BeanoMAX was published. The sister comic features many of the same characters, however the stories in BeanoMAX are written in a longer format meant for 10- to 13-year-olds. The first issue was a [[Comic Relief (charity)|Comic Relief]] special featuring assorted [[celebrity]] guests.\n\n===Plug===\n{{main|Plug (comics)}}\n''Plug'' was a comic based on the eponymous character from ''[[The Bash Street Kids]]'' that began with issue dated 24 September 1977, and is notable for being the first comic to make use of [[rotogravure]] printing. The magazine similar in style to I.P.C's ''Krazy'' which had started the previous year. It contained uncharacteristically outlandish material for D C. Thomson, as well as later including celebrity appearances in the comic.\n\nThe comic revealed Plug's full name to be Percival Proudfoot Plugsley and also gave him a pet monkey by the name of Chumkee. Plug's strip was mostly drawn by [[Vic Neill]] but other artists, including [[Dave Gudgeon]] drew some later strips. Other strips included ''Antchester United'', ''Violent Elizabeth'', ''Eebagoom'', ''Hugh's Zoo'' and ''D'ye Ken John Squeal and his Hopeless Hounds''.\n\nThe venture was unsuccessful, in part because the comic cost 9p, with the ''Beano'' at the time only costing 4p and most of its rivals priced similarly. It merged with ''[[The Beezer]]'' on 24 February 1979.\n\n===''Dennis and Gnasher''===\nThe brand new ''Dennis and Gnasher'' was launched separately from ''The Beano'' in September 2009.\n\n''Dennis and Gnasher'' got their own TV series on [[CBBC]] from 7 September 2009 to accompany the comic's new look. This was their second, having also had one in 1996, which ran for two series on CBBC, ''[[The Children's Channel]]'', and ''[[Fox Kids]]''. It also marked the debut of this Dennis in the US, as ''The Beano'' is not distributed in the US and the title is taken by the ''[[Dennis the Menace (U.S. comics)|newspaper comic strip]]''- the series aired from 10 October 2010 to 10 December 2013 on what was then known as ''The Hub'' (now renamed ''[[Discovery Family]]'').\n\n==Beano Studios==\nOn 8 June 2016, it was announced via a press release that the Beano would now form a studio under their name.  The studio would be use to bring their characters to life via other forms of media, such as television, film and live performances, to allow their properties to be distributed around the world for all audiences.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/company/beano-studios|title=Beano Studios (Linkedin)|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>  Soon after the announcement of the studio's formation, news was released about a new television series based upon the companies famous ''Dennis the Menace'' property, which unlike its previous versions, would be done in CGI rather than the classic 2D style drawing.  The studio would also revamp the website, ''beano.com''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://downthetubes.net/?p=31675|title=Beano Studios Launched, revamp on the way for comic, web site and new Dennis the Menace TV show in the works|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Children's literature}}\n* ''[[The Beano Summer Special]]''\n* ''[[The Beano Annual]]''\n*''[[Beano album]]'' - popular name for ''Blues Breakers with Eric Clapton'' (1966) as Clapton is reading the comic in the cover photo\n* [[List of magazines published in Scotland]]\n* [[British comics]]\n* [[List of Beano comic strips]]\n* [[List of Beano comic strips by annual]]\n* [[The Beano timeline]]\n* [[Beano Video]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.beano.com Official Beano site]\n* [https://shop.beano.com/ Official Beano shop]\n* {{gcdb series|id=11284|title=''The Beano Comic'' (1938-1950)}}\n* {{gcdb series|id=11285|title=''The Beano'' (1950-)}}\n* {{comicbookdb|type=title|id=631|title=''The Beano''}}\n\n{{D.

Bees are adapted for feeding on [[nectar (plant)|nectar]] and [[pollen]], the former primarily as an energy source and the latter primarily for [[protein]] and other nutrients. Most pollen is used as food for [[larva]]e. Bee pollination is important both ecologically and [[List of crop plants pollinated by bees|commercially]]; the decline in wild bees has increased the value of pollination by commercially managed hives of honey bees.\n\nBees range in size from tiny [[stingless bee]] species whose workers are less than {{convert|2|mm|inch|2}} long, to ''[[Megachile pluto]]'', the largest species of [[leafcutter bee]], whose females can attain a length of {{convert|39|mm|inch|2}}. The most common bees in the Northern Hemisphere are the [[Halictidae]], or sweat bees, but they are small and often mistaken for wasps or flies. Vertebrate predators of bees include birds such as [[bee-eater]]s; insect predators include [[beewolf|beewolves]] and [[dragonfly|dragonflies]].\n\nHuman [[beekeeping]] or apiculture has been practised for millennia, since at least the times of [[Ancient Egypt]] and [[Ancient Greece]]. Apart from honey and pollination, honey bees produce beeswax, [[royal jelly]] and [[propolis]]. Bees have appeared in mythology and folklore, through all phases of art and literature, from ancient times to the present day, though primarily focused in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], where beekeeping is far more common.\n\n== Evolution ==\n[[File:Melittosphex burmensis.jpg|thumb|''[[Melittosphex burmensis]]'', a fossil bee preserved in [[amber]] from the [[Early Cretaceous]] of [[Myanmar]]]]\n\nThe ancestors of bees were [[wasp]]s in the family [[Crabronidae]], which were [[Predation|predators]] of other insects. The switch from insect prey to pollen may have resulted from the consumption of prey insects which were flower visitors and were partially covered with pollen when they were fed to the wasp larvae.
