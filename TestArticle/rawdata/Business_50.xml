It is a form of [[strategic management]] designed to increase competition for a buyer's business in [[business-to-business]] relationships while simultaneously lowering the firm's dependence on a single supplier. Successful implementation of this strategy can lower the firm's prices and raise the service and attention from its suppliers.&lt;ref name=Biemans&gt;{{cite web|last=Biemans and Brand|first=Wim G. and Maryse J.|title=Reverse Marketing: Synergy of Purchasing and Relationaship Marketing|url=http://www.arraydev.com/commerce/jim/9802-02.htm|work=arraydev.com/|accessdate=7 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=P.

== History ==

The first survey was conducted in 1999-2000 to assess the business environment and performance of firms in the countries of [[Eastern Europe]] and [[Central Asia]]. The sample included about 4000 firms.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} Since then three other rounds of the survey have been conducted.&lt;ref name="TurleyLuke2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OECD2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=OECD|title=Progress in Policy Reforms to Improve the Investment Climate in South East Europe Investment Reform Index 2006: Investment Reform Index 2006|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rtLVAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA92|date=13 November 2007|publisher=OECD Publishing|isbn=978-92-64-03724-3|pages=92–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The 2008-2009 survey covered more than 11,000 firms.  The 2008 round survey questionnaire and the sampling methodology were significantly modified, making direct cross-period comparisons problematic.
This survey was conducted in the following 28 countries: [[Albania]], [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Belarus]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Estonia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Hungary]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan|Kyrgyz Republic]], [[Montenegro]], [[Lithuania]], [[Latvia]], [[Macedonia (country)|Macedonia]], [[Moldova]], [[Poland]], [[Russia|Russian Federation]], [[Romania]], [[Serbia]], [[Slovakia|Slovak Republic]], [[Slovenia]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Turkey]], [[Ukraine]], [[Uzbekistan]].

== Other business surveys ==

Several other projects are conducted with a similar purpose of describing business environment in different countries, most notably ''The [[Doing Business Report]]''. Unlike ''The Doing Business Report'', BEEPS are only conducted in the countries of Eastern Europe and Central Asia.&lt;ref name="BourguignonJacquet2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hellman, Joel, et al.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4886">'''Blindspots analysis''' (also '''blind spots analysis''') is a method aimed at uncovering obsolete, incomplete, or incorrect assumptions in a decision maker’s mental scheme of the environment. [[Michael Porter]] used the term "blind spots" to refer to conventional wisdom which no longer holds true, but which still guides business strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Porter Michael, E. |date=1980|title= Competitive Strategy|location= NY|publisher= Free Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept was further popularized by [[Barbara Tuchman]], in her book ''The March of Folly'' (1984),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tuchman, Barbara |date=1985|title= The March of Folly|location= NY|publisher= Ballantine Books |edition=Paperback }}&lt;/ref&gt; to describe political decisions and strategies which were clearly wrong in their assumptions, and by other authors since, such as social psychologists [[Mahzarin Banaji]] and [[Anthony Greenwald]] in their study of [[prejudice]].

==Uncovering blind spots==
Ben Gilad fully developed, in his book, ''Business Blindspots'' (1994), the following three-step "Gilad method" for uncovering blind spots&lt;ref&gt;(Gilad, (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;
#''Step One'': Conducting a [[Porter five forces analysis|Porter’s Industry Structure – aka 5 force analysis]] on a given industry or segment (market), augmented with identification of possible change drivers, which are defined as trends with the potential to have profound (structural) effect on the balance of power among the five forces.&lt;ref&gt;(Gilad, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;
#''Step Two:'' Collecting [[competitive intelligence]] on the target company’s top executives assumptions regarding the same industry structure as in Step One. Sources may include annual reports' letters to shareholders, autobiographies, interviews in the press, public appearances and speeches, industry meetings, congressional testimonies, conference calls with security analysts (transcripts are publicly available), and all other statements regarding vision and beliefs. An alternative technique is known among competitive intelligence professionals as “strategy’s reverse engineering” which looks for the underlying assumptions which can rationalize existing strategy.
#''Step Three:'' Compare the results of Step Two with the analysis in Step One. Any contradiction with the analysis in Step One is a potential blindspot.

== Underlying assumptions ==

Underlying Blindspots Analysis is an assumption about the inherent [[cognitive bias|biases]] of decision making at the top of organizations (business, government or otherwise) exceeding those of their subordinates or outsiders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Liff, Stewart|author-link=Stewart Liff|title= The Complete Guide to Hiring and Firing Government Employees|pages= 109–111|publisher= AMACOM|location= New York|date=2009|isbn= 978-0-8144-1450-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; While many top executives in business and government organizations are smart, capable people, they are also vulnerable to several decision biases that come with their powerful positions, including [[cognitive dissonance]], motivated cognitions, overconfidence, and ego-involvement.&lt;ref&gt;(Cramer et al., 2005),(Rosenzweig, 2007), (Bossidy and Charan, 2004), (USA Today, 2005), (Gilad, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rosenzweig, Phil|title= The Halo Effect: ... and the Eight Other Business Delusions That Deceive Managers|location= NY|publisher=The Free Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0743291255|edition=Hardcover}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The impaired ability of leaders to see reality for what it is, and the more objective (less ego-involved) analysis of analysts and mid-level planners means that Step 3 of the Blindspots Analysis can be a powerful tool for pointing to potential blinders

'''Boutique manufacturing''' is a method used for the custom production of certain products in limited quantities by hand or with a restricted level of automation. Products produced this way often include ceramics, furniture, amplifiers, yachts, boats, leather goods or watches and jewellery among others. In industrial countries, boutique manufacturing is being selected generally for high class goods in upper price levels and only for single products or small batches.

==Benefits and disadvantages==

The key advantages of boutique manufacturing in comparison to traditional factory manufacturing with batch fabrication, large or mass production are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;
* low investment in factory automation
* high flexibility during manufacturing
* quick alteration of product types produced on every workplace or production line
* supports build to order without the necessity of using many pre-assembled components; creation of value caused by assembly takes place mainly at the end of the production flow.
* allows an unachieved level of product individualization

Consequently, boutique manufacturing closes the gap between piece production and small batch/low volume production. The workflow organization of a boutique manufacturing entity can be a mixture of both – elements of jobbing or batch production, however involving higher standardization than the first one. Often boutique manufacturing workshop and factories are organized with single workplaces or production cells carrying out a number of subsequent production steps until completion of certain components or even the whole product. Flexibility and variety of products being able to produce in the entity therefore are much higher than with the more standardized method batch production. 

However, with this method, manufacturing of larger quantities of unified products is not possible at reasonable costs. Serial fabrication or large production of goods then would be suitable alternative production methods involving higher grades of automation and standardization.

'''Business metadata''' is data that adds business context to other data.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It provides information authored by business people and/or used by business people.  It is in contrast to [[technical metadata]], which is data used in the storage and structure of the data in a [[database]] or system. Technical metadata includes the database table name and column name, data type, indexes referencing the data, [[Extract, transform, load|ETL]] jobs involving the data, when the data was last updated, accessed, etc.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Concept ==
According to noted author and columnist Lowell Fryman, "The essence of business metadata is in reducing or eliminating the barriers of communication between human and human, as well as human and computer, so that the data conveyed from reports, information systems, or business intelligence applications can be crystal clear, can facilitate business operations, and can be leveraged for all business decision-making processes."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://searchdatamanagement.techtarget.com/news/2240111047/What-is-metadata-Solutions-for-leveraging-technical-and-business-metadata|title=What is metadata? Solutions for leveraging technical and business metadata|work=SearchDataManagement|access-date=2017-03-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dan Linstedt, creator of the [[Data vault modeling|Data Vault]] methodology, says business metadata "...provide[s] definition of the functionality, definition of the data, definition of the elements, and definition of how the data is used within business...business metadata includes business requirements, time-lines, business metrics, business process flows, and business terminology."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.b-eye-network.com/blogs/linstedt/archives/2006/07/technical_versu.php|title=Technical versus Business Metadata - classifications - Blog: Dan E. Linstedt - BeyeNETWORK|website=www.b-eye-network.com|access-date=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Business metadata is important because it can greatly facilitate the usefulness of the data to business people.  A simple example of business metadata is a glossary entry.  Hover functionality in an application or web form can enable a glossary definition to be shown when cursor is on a field or term.

Other examples of business metadata include annotation ability within applications.  For example, a business user may be viewing a [[business intelligence]] (BI) report and notice a trend in the data.  The user may have background knowledge as to why this trend occurs.  Some business intelligence tools enable the user to create an annotation within the report that explains the trend.  Such an annotation can enhance other users' understanding of the data.  This example is especially powerful because it is created by a business user for the use of other business people.

== Examples ==
Other examples of business metadata are:
* Business rules
* Data quality rules
* Valid values for reference data
* Wikis 
* Collaboration software

{{Business administration}}

A '''business process''' or '''business method'''  is a collection of related, structured activities or [[Task (project management)|tasks]] by people or equipment that in a specific sequence produces a service or product (serves a particular business goal) for a particular customer or customers. Business processes occur in all organizantional level and it may or may not be visible to customers. &lt;ref name="WeskeBusiness12"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-D5tpT5Xz8oC&amp;pg=PA5 |chapter=Chapter 1: Introduction |title=Business Process Management: Concepts, Languages, Architectures |author=Weske, M. |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |pages=1–24 |year=2012 |isbn=9783642286162}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KirchmerHigh17"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nz1RDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA3 |chapter=Chapter 1: Business Process Management: What Is It and Why Do You Need It? |title=High Performance Through Business Process Management: Strategy Execution in a Digital World |author=Kirchmer, M. |publisher=Springer |pages=1–28 |year=2017 |isbn=9783319512594}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vonScheelPhase114"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RT7LAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1 |chapter=Phase 1: Process Concept Evolution |title=The Complete Business Process Handbook: Body of Knowledge from Process Modeling to BPM |author=von Scheel, H.; von Rosing, M.; Fonseca, M. et al. |editor1=von Rosing, M.|editor2=Scheer, A.-W.|editor3=von Scheel, H. |volume=1 |publisher=Morgan Kaufmann |year=2014 |pages=1–10 |isbn=9780128004722}}&lt;/ref&gt; A business process may often be visualized (modeled) as a [[flowchart]] of a sequence of activities with interleaving decision points or as a process matrix of a sequence of activities with relevance rules based on data in the process.&lt;ref name="KirchmerHigh17" /&gt;&lt;ref name="vonScheelPhase114" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ChenBusiness12"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HX3gBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA198 |chapter=Chapter 8: BPR Methodologies: Methods and Tools |title=Business Process Engineering: Advancing the State of the Art |author=Chen, M. |editor1=Elzinga, D.J.|editor2=Gulledge, T.R.|editor3=Lee, C.-Y. |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |pages=187–212 |year=2012 |isbn=9781461550914}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ChandBusiness12"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6oVVBNemLRMC&amp;pg=PA36 |chapter=Chapter 3: Business Process Modeling |title=Business Enterprise, Process, and Technology Management: Models and Applications |author=Chand, D.R.; Chircu, A.M. |editor=Elzinga, D.J.; Gulledge, T.R.; Lee, C.-Y. |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |pages=187–212 |year=2012 |isbn=9781466602502}}&lt;/ref&gt; The benefits of using business processes include improved customer satisfaction and improved agility for reacting to rapid market change.&lt;ref name="WeskeBusiness12" /&gt;&lt;ref name="KirchmerHigh17" /&gt; Process-oriented organizations break down the barriers of structural departments and try to avoid [[functional silo]]s.

== Overview ==
A business process begins with a mission objective (an external event) and ends with achievement of the business objective of providing a result that provides customer value. Additionally, a process may be divided into subprocesses (process decomposition), the particular inner functions of the process. Business processes may also have a process owner, a responsible party for ensuring the process runs smoothly from start to finish.&lt;ref name="KirchmerHigh17" /&gt; 

Broadly speaking, business processes can be organized into three types, according to von Rosing ''et al.''&lt;ref name="vonRosingProcess14"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RT7LAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA162 |chapter=Process Tagging - A Process Classification and Categorization Concept |title=The Complete Business Process Handbook: Body of Knowledge from Process Modeling to BPM |author=von Rosing, M.; Kemp, N.; Hove, M.; Ross, J.W. |editor1=von Rosing, M.|editor2=Scheer, A.-W.|editor3=von Scheel, H. |volume=1 |publisher=Morgan Kaufmann |year=2014 |pages=123–172 |isbn=9780128004722}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

# Operational processes, which constitute the [[core business]] and create the primary value stream, e.g., taking orders from customers, opening an account, and manufacturing a component
# [[Management process]]es, the processes that oversee operational processes, including [[corporate governance]], budgetary oversight, and employee oversight
# Supporting processes, which support the core operational processes, e.g., [[accounting]], [[recruitment]], [[call center]], [[technical support]], and safety training

A slightly different approach to these three types is offered by Kirchmer&lt;ref name="KirchmerHigh17" /&gt;:

# Operational processes, which focus on properly executing the operational tasks of an entity; this is where personnel "get the things done"
# Management processes, which ensure that the operational processes are conducted appropriately; this is where managers "ensure efficient and effective work processes"
# Governance processes, which ensure the entity is operating in full compliance with necessary legal regulations, guidelines, and shareholder expectations; this is where executives ensure the "rules and guidelines for business success" are followed

A complex business process may be decomposed into several subprocesses, which have their own attributes but also contribute to achieving the overall goal of the business. The analysis of business processes typically includes the mapping or modeling of processes and sub-processes down to activity/task level. Processes can be modeled through a large number of methods and techniques. For instance, the [[Business Process Modeling Notation]] is a [[business process modeling]] technique that can be used for drawing business processes in a visualized [[workflow]].&lt;ref name="WeskeBusiness12" /&gt;&lt;ref name="KirchmerHigh17" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ChenBusiness12" /&gt;&lt;ref name="vonRosingProcess14" /&gt; While decomposing processes into process types and categories can be useful, care must be taken in doing so as there may be crossover. In the end, all processes are part of a largely unified outcome, one of "customer value creation."&lt;ref name="vonRosingProcess14" /&gt; This goal is expedited with business process management, which aims to analyze, improve, and enact business processes.&lt;ref name="KirchmerHigh17" /&gt;

==History==
=== Adam Smith ===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Division of labour]] --&gt;
An important early (1776) description of processes was that of economist [[Adam Smith]] in his famous example of a [[pin (device)|pin]] factory. Inspired by an article in [[Diderot|Diderot's]] [[Encyclopédie]], Smith described the production of a pin in the following way&lt;ref name="SmithAnInquiry27"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rpMuAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA3 |chapter=Book I. Of the Causes of Improvement in the Productive Powers of Labour, and of the Order According to Which Its Produce Is Naturally Distributed among the Different Ranks of the People |title=An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations |author=Smith, A. |publisher=University Press; Thomas Nelson and Peter Brown |year=1827}}&lt;/ref&gt;:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
”One man draws out the wire; another straights it; a third cuts it; a fourth points it; a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving the head; to make the head requires two or three distinct operations; to put it on is a peculiar business; to whiten the pins is another ... and the important business of making a pin is, in this manner, divided into about eighteen distinct operations, which, in some manufactories, are all performed by distinct hands, though in others the same man will sometimes perform two or three of them.”
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Smith also first recognized how the output could be increased through the use of [[Division of labor|labor division]]. Previously, in a society where production was dominated by [[artisan|handcrafted goods]], one man would perform all the activities required during the production process, while Smith described how the work was divided into a set of simple tasks, which would be performed by specialized workers.&lt;ref name="vonScheelPhase114" /&gt; The result of labor division in Smith’s example resulted in productivity increasing by 24,000 percent (sic), i.e. that the same number of workers made 240 times as many pins as they had been producing before the introduction of labor division.&lt;ref name="SmithAnInquiry27" /&gt;

It is worth noting that Smith did not advocate labor division at any price and ''[[wikt:per se|per se]]''. The appropriate level of task division was defined through experimental design of the production process. In contrast to Smith's view which was limited to the same functional domain and comprised activities that are in direct sequence in the manufacturing process&lt;ref name="SmithAnInquiry27" /&gt;, today's process concept includes cross-functionality as an important characteristic. Following his ideas, the division of labor was adopted widely, while the integration of tasks into a functional, or cross-functional, process was not considered as an alternative option until much later.&lt;ref name="GiaglisItsTime12"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P2DmCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA315 |chapter=It's Time to Engineer Re-engineering: Investigating the Potential of Simulation Modelling for Business Process Redesign |title=Business Process Modelling |author=Giaglis, G.M.; Paul, R.J. |editor=Scholz-Reiter, B.; Stickel, E. |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |year=2012 |pages=313–329 |isbn=9783642803178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Frederick Winslow Taylor ===
American engineer, [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]] greatly influenced and improved the quality of [[industrial processes]] in the early twentieth century. His [[Principles of Scientific Management]] focused on standardization of processes, systematic training and clearly defining the roles of management and employees.&lt;ref name="vonScheelPhase114" /&gt; His methods were widely adopted in the [[United States]], Russia and parts of Europe and led to further developments such as “time and motion study” and visual task optimization techniques, such as [[Gantt charts]].

=== Peter Drucker ===
In the latter part of the twentieth century, management guru [[Peter Drucker]] focused much of his work on simplification and decentralization of processes, which led to the concept of [[outsourcing]]. He also coined the concept of the "[[knowledge worker]] — as differentiated from manual workers — and how knowledge management would become part of an entity's processes.&lt;ref name="DruckerTheAge17"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bx0uDwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover |title=The Age of Discontinuity: Guidelines for Our Changing Society |author=Drucker, P.F. |publisher=Routledge |year=2017 |pages=420 |isbn=9781560006183}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DruckerManagement07"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1YN3kc31nqAC&amp;printsec=frontcover |title=Management Challenges for the 21st Century |author=Drucker, P.F. |publisher=Routledge |year=2007 |pages=208 |isbn=9781136386312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other definitions ===
Davenport (1993)&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Davenport (1993). ''Process Innovation: Reengineering work through information technology''. Harvard Business School Press, Boston&lt;/ref&gt; defines a (business) process as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
”a structured, measured set of activities designed to produce a specific output for a particular customer or market. It implies a strong emphasis on how work is done within an organization, in contrast to a product focus’s emphasis on what. A process is thus a specific ordering of work activities across time and space, with a beginning and an end, and clearly defined inputs and outputs: a structure for action. ... Taking a process approach implies adopting the customer’s point of view. Processes are the structure by which an organization does what is necessary to produce value for its customers.”
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This definition contains certain characteristics a process must possess. These characteristics are achieved by a focus on the business logic of the process (how work is done), instead of taking a product perspective (what is done). Following Davenport's definition of a process we can conclude that a process must have clearly defined boundaries, input and output, that it consists of smaller parts, activities, which are ordered in time and space, that there must be a receiver of the process outcome- a customer - and that the transformation taking place within the process must add customer value.

Hammer &amp; Champy’s (1993)&lt;ref&gt;Michael Hammer and James Champy (1993). ''Reengineering the Corporation: A Manifesto for Business Revolution'', Harper Business&lt;/ref&gt; definition can be considered as a subset of Davenport’s. They define a process as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
”a collection of activities that takes one or more kinds of input and creates an output that is of value to the customer.”
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
As we can note, Hammer &amp; Champy have a more transformation oriented perception, and put less emphasis on the structural component – process boundaries and the order of activities in time and space.

Rummler &amp; Brache (1995)&lt;ref&gt;Rummler &amp; Brache (1995). ''Improving Performance: How to manage the white space on the organizational chart''. Jossey-Bass, San Francisco&lt;/ref&gt; use a definition that clearly encompasses a focus on the organization’s external customers, when stating that
&lt;blockquote&gt;
”a business process is a series of steps designed to produce a product or service. Most processes (...) are cross-functional, spanning the ‘white space’ between the boxes on the organization chart. Some processes result in a product or service that is received by an organization's external customer. We call these primary processes. Other processes produce products that are invisible to the external customer but essential to the effective management of the business. We call these support processes.”
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The above definition distinguishes two types of processes, primary and support processes, depending on whether a process is directly involved in the creation of customer value, or concerned with the organization’s internal activities. In this sense, Rummler and Brache's definition follows Porter's [[value chain]] model, which also builds on a division of primary and secondary activities. According to Rummler and Brache, a typical characteristic of a successful process-based organization is the absence of secondary activities in the primary value flow that is created in the customer oriented primary processes. The characteristic of processes as spanning the white space on the organization chart indicates that processes are embedded in some form of organizational structure. Also, a process can be cross-functional, i.e. it ranges over several business functions.

Johansson et al. (1993).&lt;ref&gt;Henry J. Johansson et al. (1993). ''Business Process Reengineering: BreakPoint Strategies for Market Dominance''. John Wiley &amp; Sons&lt;/ref&gt; define a process as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
”a set of linked activities that take an input and transform it to create an output. Ideally, the transformation that occurs in the process should add value to the input and create an output that is more useful and effective to the recipient either upstream or downstream.”
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This definition also emphasizes the constitution of links between activities and the transformation that takes place within the process. Johansson et al. also include the upstream part of the value chain as a possible recipient of the process output. Summarizing the four definitions above, we can compile the following list of characteristics for a business process:

# ''Definability'' : It must have clearly defined boundaries, input and output.
# ''Order'' : It must consist of activities that are ordered according to their position in time and space (a sequence).
# ''Customer'' : There must be a recipient of the process' outcome, a customer.
# ''Value-adding'' :  The transformation taking place within the process must add value to the recipient, either upstream or downstream.
# ''Embeddedness'' : A process cannot exist in itself, it must be embedded in an organizational structure.
# ''Cross-functionality'' : A process regularly can, but not necessarily must, span several functions.

Frequently, identifying a [[process owner]], (i.e., the person responsible for the continuous improvement of the process) is considered as a prerequisite.  Sometimes the process owner is the same person who is performing the process.

==Related concepts==

===Workflow===

[[Workflow]] is the procedural movement of information, material, and tasks from one participant to another.&lt;ref name="WeskeBusiness2_12"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-D5tpT5Xz8oC&amp;pg=PA50 |chapter=Chapter 2: Evolution of Enterprise Systems Architecture |title=Business Process Management: Concepts, Languages, Architectures |author=Weske, M. |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |pages=25–72 |year=2012 |isbn=9783642286162}}&lt;/ref&gt; Workflow includes the procedures, people and tools involved in each step of a business process. A single workflow may either be sequential, with each step contingent upon completion of the previous one, or parallel, with multiple steps occurring simultaneously. Multiple combinations of single workflows may be connected to achieve a resulting overall process.&lt;ref name="WeskeBusiness2_12" /&gt;

===Business process re-engineering===

[[Business process re-engineering]] (BPR) was originally conceptualized by Hammer and Davenport as a means to improve organizational effectiveness and productivity. It consisted of starting from a blank slate and completely recreating major business processes as well as the use of information technology for significant performance improvement. The term unfortunately became associated with corporate "downsizing" in the mid-1990s.&lt;ref name="KockProcess99"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q2MWwin1QSYC&amp;pg=PA18 |chapter=Chapter 2: What Is a Process? |title=Process Improvement and Organizational Learning: The Role of Collaboration Technologies |author=Kock, N.F. |publisher=Idea Group Publishing |year=1999 |pages=17–28 |isbn=9781878289582}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Business process management (BPM)===

Though the term has been used contextually to mixed effect, "[[business process management]]" (BPM) can generally be defined as a discipline involving a combination of a wide variety of business activity flows (e.g., [[business process automation]], modeling, and optimization) that strives to support the goals of an enterprise within and beyond multiple boundaries, involving many people, from employees to customers and external partners.&lt;ref name="SwensonPhase4_14"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RT7LAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA79 |chapter=Phase 4: What Is Business Process Management? |title=The Complete Business Process Handbook: Body of Knowledge from Process Modeling to BPM |author=Swenson, K.D.; von Rosing, M. |editor1=von Rosing, M.|editor2=Scheer, A.-W.|editor3=von Scheel, H. |volume=1 |publisher=Morgan Kaufmann |year=2015 |pages=79–88 |isbn=9780127999593}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major part of BPM's enterprise support involves the continuous evaluation of existing processes and the identification of ways to improve upon it, resulting in a cycle of overall organizational improvement.

===Knowledge management===

[[Knowledge management]] is the definition of the knowledge that employees and systems use to perform their functions and maintaining it in a format that can be accessed by others. The Duhon and the Gartner Group have defined it as "a discipline that promotes an integrated approach to identifying, capturing, evaluating, retrieving, and sharing all of an enterprise's information assets. These assets may include databases, documents, policies, procedures, and previously un-captured expertise and experience in individual workers."&lt;ref name="NikolićContemp13"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.iiakm.org/ojakm/articles/2013/volume1_1/OJAKM_Volume1_1pp72-81.pdf |format=PDF |title=Contemporary management in a higher education institution in Serbia |journal=Online Journal of Applied Knowledge Management |author=Nikolić, B.; Dakić, J.; Ružić-Dimitrijević, L. |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=72–81 |year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Total quality management===

[[Total quality management]] (TQM) emerged in the early 1980s as organizations sought to improve the quality of their products and services. It was followed by the [[Six Sigma|Six Sigma methodology]] in the mid-1980s, first introduced by Motorola. Six Sigma consists of statistical methods to improve business processes and thus reduce defects in outputs. The "lean approach" to quality management was introduced by the Toyota Motor Company in the 1990s and focused on customer needs and reduction of wastage.&lt;ref name="Juran"&gt;{{Citation | last = Juran | first = Joseph M. | author-link = Joseph M.

===Information technology as an enabler for business process management===

Advances in information technology over the years, have changed business processes within and between business enterprises. In the 1960s, operating systems had limited functionality, and any workflow management systems that were in use were tailor-made for the specific organization. The 1970s-1980s saw the development of data-driven approaches, as data storage and retrieval technologies improved. Data modeling rather than process modeling was the starting point for building an information system. Business processes had to adapt to information technology because process modeling was neglected. The shift towards process-oriented management occurred in the 1990s. Enterprise resource planning software with workflow management components such as SAP, Baan, [[PeopleSoft]], Oracle and [[JD Edwards]] emerged, as did business process management systems (BPMS) later.&lt;ref name="PalmeriBPM_14"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=iBPM - Intelligent Business Process Management |title=The Complete Business Process Handbook: Body of Knowledge from Process Modeling to BPM |author=Palmer, N. |editor1=von Rosing, M.|editor2=Scheer, A.-W.|editor3=von Scheel, H. |volume=1 |publisher=Morgan Kaufmann |year=2015 |pages=349–361 |isbn=9780127999593}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The world of e-business created a need to automate business processes across organizations, which in turn raised the need for standardized protocols and web services composition languages that can be understood across the industry. The [[Business Process Modeling Notation]] (BPMN) and [[Business Motivation Model]] (BMM) are widely used standards for business modeling.&lt;ref name="KirchmerHigh17" /&gt;&lt;ref name="vonScheelPhase114" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ChenBusiness12" /&gt; The Business Modeling and Integration Domain Task Force (BMI DTF) is a consortium of vendors and user companies that continues to work together to develop standards and specifications to promote collaboration and integration of people, systems, processes and information within and across enterprises.&lt;ref name="OMGBusiness"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.omg.org/bmi/ |title=Business Modeling &amp; Integration DTF |publisher=Object Management Group |accessdate=23 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most recent trends in BPM are influenced by the emergence of [[cloud technology]], the prevalence of [[social media]], mobile technology, and the development of analytical techniques. Cloud-based technologies allow companies to purchase resources quickly and as required independent of their location. Social media, websites and smart phones are the newest channels through which organizations reach and support their customers. The abundance of customer data collected through these channels as well as through call center interactions, emails, voice calls, and customer surveys has led to a huge growth in data analytics which in turn is utilized for performance management and improving the ways in which the company services its customers.&lt;ref name="RossSMAC13"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://analytics-magazine.org/analytics-and-business-process-management/ |title=Analytics &amp; Business Process Management |author=Ross, M. |work=Analytics |publisher=Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences |date=July-August 2013 |accessdate=23 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importance of the process chain==

Business processes comprise a set of sequential sub-processes or tasks with alternative paths, depending on certain conditions as applicable, performed to achieve a given objective or produce given outputs. Each process has one or more needed inputs. The inputs and outputs may be received from, or sent to other business processes, other [[organizational unit]]s, or internal or external stakeholders.&lt;ref name="WeskeBusiness12" /&gt;

Business processes are designed to be operated by one or more business functional units, and emphasize the importance of the “[[process chain]]” rather than the individual units.

In general, the various tasks of a business process can be performed in one of two ways&lt;ref name="WeskeBusiness12" /&gt;:

# manually
# by means of business [[data processing]] systems such as [[ERP system]]s

Typically, some process tasks will be manual, while some will be computer-based, and these tasks may be sequenced in many ways. In other words, the data and information that are being handled through the process may pass through manual or computer tasks in any given order.

==Policies, processes and procedures==

The above improvement areas are equally applicable to policies, processes, [[Procedure (business)|detailed procedures]] (sub-processes/tasks) and [[Work instruction|work instructions]]. There is a cascading effect of improvements made at a higher level on those made at a lower level.&lt;ref name="RohdeEffective09"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ymOtDqFjMwYC&amp;pg=PA105 |chapter=Chapter 7: Communicating Your Process Through Effective Policies, Procedures, and Job Aides |title=Effective Process Management: Improving Your Healthcare Delivery |author=Rohde, K.R. |publisher=HC Pro |pages=105–128 |isbn=9781601466549}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, if a recommendation to replace a given policy with a better one is made with proper justification and accepted in principle by business process owners, then corresponding changes in the consequent processes and procedures will follow naturally in order to enable implementation of the policies.

==Reporting as an essential base for execution==

Business processes must include up-to-date and accurate [[business reporting|reports]] to ensure effective action.&lt;ref name="RosingWorking_14"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Working with the Business Process Management (BPM) Life Cycle |title=The Complete Business Process Handbook: Body of Knowledge from Process Modeling to BPM |author=von Rosing, M.; Foldager, U.; Hove, M. et al. |editor1=von Rosing, M.|editor2=Scheer, A.-W.|editor3=von Scheel, H. |volume=1 |publisher=Morgan Kaufmann |year=2015 |pages=265–341 |isbn=9780127999593}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this is the availability of [[purchase order]] status reports for supplier delivery follow-up as described in the section on effectiveness above. There are numerous examples of this in every possible business process.

Another example from production is the process of analysis of line [[wikt:reject|reject]]ions occurring on the shop floor. This process should include systematic periodical analysis of rejections by reason, and present the results in a suitable information report that pinpoints the major reasons, and trends in these reasons, for management to take [[corrective action]]s to control rejections and keep them within acceptable limits. Such a process of analysis and summarisation of line rejection events is clearly superior to a process which merely inquires into each individual rejection as it occurs.

Business [[process owner]]s and operatives should realise that process improvement often occurs with introduction of appropriate transaction, operational, highlight, exception or [[Management information system|M.I.S.]] reports, provided these are consciously used for day-to-day or periodical decision-making. With this understanding would hopefully come the willingness to invest time and other resources in business process improvement by introduction of useful and relevant reporting systems.

== Supporting theories and concepts ==

=== Span of control ===
The [[span of control]] is the number of subordinates a supervisor manages within a structural [[organization]]. Introducing a business process concept has a considerable impact on the structural elements of the organization and thus also on the span of control.&lt;ref name="GlykasBusiness12"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=A Holistic Business Performance Measurement Framework |title=Business Process Management: Theory and Applications |author=Sezenias, E.; Farmakis, A.; Karagiannis, G. et al. |editor=Glykas, M. |publisher=Springer |year=2012 |pages=75–98 |isbn=9783642284090}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Large organizations that are not organized as markets need to be organized in smaller units – [[departmentalization|departments]] – which can be defined according to different principles.

=== Information management concepts ===
[[Information management]], and the organization infrastructure strategies related to it, are a theoretical cornerstone of the business process concept, requiring "a framework for measuring the level of IT support for business processes."&lt;ref name="SidorovaTheRole14"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=The Role of Information Technology in Business Process Management |title=The Role of Information Technology in Business Process Management |author=Sidorova, A.; Torres, R.; Al Beayeyz, A. |editor=vom Brocke, J.; Rosemann, M. |publisher=Springer |series=International Handbooks on Information Systems |pages=421–444 }year=2014 |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-45100-3_18 |isbn=9783642451003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''business record''' is a [[document]] (hard copy or digital) that records a business dealing. Business records include meeting [[minutes]], [[memoranda]], [[employment contract]]s, and [[:Category:Accounting source documents|accounting source documents]].

It must be retrievable at a later date so that the business dealings can be accurately reviewed as required. Since business is dependent upon confidence and trust, not only must the record be accurate and easily retrieved, the processes surrounding its creation and retrieval must be perceived by customers and the business community to consistently deliver a full and accurate record with no gaps or additions.

Most business records have specified [[retention period]]s based on legal requirements and / or internal company policies.  This is important because in many countries (including the United States) many documents ''may'' be required by law to be disclosed to [[Government agency|government regulatory agencies]] or to the general public.  Likewise, they ''may'' be [[Discovery (law)|discoverable]] if the business is [[Lawsuit|sued]].  Under the [[business records exception]] in the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]], certain types of business records, particularly those made and kept with regularity, may be considered [[Admissible evidence|admissible]] in court despite containing [[Hearsay in United States law|hearsay]].

A '''cash advance''' is a service provided by most [[credit card]] and [[charge card]] issuers. The service allows cardholders to withdraw [[cash]], either through an [[automatic teller machine|ATM]] or over the counter at a bank or other financial agency, up to a certain limit. For a credit card, this will be the credit limit (or some percentage of it).

Cash advances often incur a fee of 3 to 5 percent of the amount being borrowed. When made on a credit card, the interest is often higher than other credit card transactions. The interest compounds daily starting from the day cash is borrowed.

Some "purchases" made with a credit card of items that are viewed as cash are also considered to be cash advances in accordance with the credit card network's guidelines, thereby incurring the higher interest rate and the lack of the grace period. These often include [[money order]]s, [[Debit_card#Prepaid_debit_cards|prepaid debit cards]], [[lottery]] tickets, [[gaming chip]]s, and certain taxes and fees paid to certain governments. However, should the merchant not disclose the actual nature of the transactions, these will be processed as regular credit card transactions. Many merchants have passed on the credit card processing fees to the credit card holders in spite of the credit card network's guidelines, which state the credit card holders should not have any extra fee for doing a transaction with a credit card.

Under card scheme rules, a credit card holder presenting an accepted form of identification must be issued a cash advance over the counter at any bank which issues that type of credit card, even if the cardholder cannot give their [[personal identification number|PIN]].

==Overview==

=== Origin ===
Coakes and Smith (2007) define '''Communities of Innovation''' ('''CoI''') as a form of [[Communities of Practice]] that are dedicated to the support of [[innovation]]. They suggest that CoI can be formed from champions of innovation and their [[social network]] and that CoI are safe places for the creation and support of innovatory ideas.&lt;ref name="Coakes and Smith (2007)"/&gt; COI  are groups made up of motivated individuals working together towards a common goal, not because of orders from their superiors, but because they are convinced of their common cause.&lt;ref name="Grimaldi and Rogo (2009)"/&gt;

=== Development ===

==== Communities of Creation ====
Sawhney and Prandelli (2000) proposed the model of Communities of Creation as a new governance mechanism for managing knowledge found in different companies for the purpose of innovation. Intellectual property rights are considered to be owned by the entire community although the community is governed by a central firm which acts as the sponsor and defines the ground rules for participation. This model lies between the closed hierarchical model and the open market-based model.&lt;ref name="Sawhney and Prandelli (2000)"/&gt;

== Communities of Innovation compared to Communities of Practice ==
These are Communities that take total financial, administrative and operational control over the development of their communities. Democratically elected and answerable to the whole community. It is simply an extension of the community saving societies that have  existed for centuries. The prime objective is sustainable environmental and social development controlled by the skills and finance available. It provides employment, improves the future prospects for all participants and their children, and injects a sense of pride and achievement. Using locally available materials linked to new environmentally friendly cost effective construction materials will produce affordable housing, schools and roads.

== Examples of Communities of Innovation ==

=== The COI that developed Linux ===
Traditionally, the company is the most efficient mean of managing knowledge belonging to different people. The primary [[motivation]] is job security, career advancement and recognition. Lee and Cole (2003) argue for a [[community structure]] for knowledge creation that crosses firms’ boundaries.&lt;ref name="Lee and Cole (2003)"&gt;Lee, G. K. and R. E. Cole. 2003. From a firm-based to a community-based model of knowledge creation: The case of the Linux Kernel development. Organization Science 14 (6) 633-649.&lt;/ref&gt; To substantiate their argument they put forth the case of how “thousands of talented volunteers, dispersed across organizational and geographical boundaries, collaborate via the [[Internet]] to produce a knowledge-intensive, [[innovative]] product of high [[Quality (business)|quality]],” the [[Linux]] kernel (Lee and Cole 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;633). The Linux community has proved to be a very efficient mean of managing knowledge belonging to different people. The primary [[motivation]] is value system, recognition and potential career advancement or hop. Lee and Cole (2003) argue that research on [[knowledge management]] has to date focused on [[hierarchy]] and therefore has not adequately addressed the mobilization of [[distributed knowledge]], knowledge that is dispersed among many people. They note that, as illustrated by the [[Linux]] case, “the advent of the Internet and [[Web-based technologies]] has enabled specialized communities to convene, interact, and share [[resources]] extensively via electronic interfaces,” even across firms’ boundaries (Lee and Cole 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;633). People are able to contribute effectively outside their working hours. [[wikt:coordination|coordination]] of the work (including [[feedback]]) is possible even when people are working from different locations. The [[Catchment area (human geography)|catchment area]] is therefore much larger and the [[critical mass]] of software engineers required to develop and maintain the Linux project was therefore achievable.

== Benefits of Community of Innovation ==

=== Organizational Ambidexterity ===

Successful COIs increase innovations within an organization. They therefore have the potential to contribute to [[organizational ambidexterity]], which refers to the organization’s dual capabilities of managing current business and being flexible and adaptable to meet future changes and demands.&lt;ref name="Raisch &amp; Birkinshaw (2008)"&gt;Raisch, S. and J. Birkinshaw. 2008. Organizational ambidexterity: Antecedents, outcomes, and moderators. Journal of Management 34 (3) 375-409&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Conduent Inc.''' is a technology-led [[Business process management|business process services]] company headquartered in [[New Jersey]]. It was formed in 2017 as a divestiture from [[Xerox]]. The company offers digital platforms for businesses and governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/30/business/dealbook/xerox-split-icahn.html |title=Xerox, in Deal With Carl Icahn, to Split Company in Two |first1=Michael J. |last1=de la Merced |first2=Leslie |last2=Picker |date=January 29, 2016 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=2016-01-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=323756013 |title=Company Overview of Conduent Inc. |date=September 8, 2016 |work=[[Bloomberg News|Bloomberg]] |accessdate=2016-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jamerson"/&gt; It has 93,000 employees in more than 40 countries.&lt;ref name="Investor relations"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://investor.conduent.com/ |title=Investor relations |publisher=Conduent |accessdate=2017-01-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
On 30 June 2016, Xerox announced that it would be spinning off its Xerox Business Services division into a wholly separate corporation, for which the name was yet to be determined.  The business scope of the new company was generally understood to be essentially identical to that of former business services company [[Affiliated Computer Services]] (ACS), which Xerox had acquired six years earlier in 2010.&lt;ref name="burke"&gt;Burke, Patrick (2016-07-13). Burke: Xerox spinoff Conduent a likely takeover target. Democrat and Chronicle, 13 July 2016. Retrieved from http://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/money/columnist/burke/2016/07/13/xerox-conduent-carl-icahn-takeover/87026628/.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="farrell"&gt;Farrell, Maureen (2016-01-29).

On 6 October 2016, having previously announced its intent to separate into two separate companies, Xerox announced the identity of the new business services company as Conduent. It described the company's "coined name" as "inspired by the company's expertise in managing transactional relationships between their clients and their constituents".&lt;ref name="identity"&gt;Xerox (2016-10-06). Xerox Unveils Conduent's New Global Brand Identity. Xerox, 6 October 2016. Retrieved from https://www.news.xerox.com/news/Xerox-unveils-global-brand-identity-for-Conduent.&lt;/ref&gt; On its corporate blog, Conduent posted an article by chief marketing officer John Kennedy, who described the name as "derived with inspiration from several places". Kennedy wrote that when trying to summarize what the new company does, "words like conduit, confluence and constituent come to mind." He wrote that the company considered nearly 6,000 possible names before choosing Conduent, which he described as "a name that seemed perfect for our new BPO Company."&lt;ref name="kennedy"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.blogs.conduent.com/2016/06/16/whats-in-a-name/ |title=What's in a name? |first=John |last=Kennedy |date=16 June 2016 |publisher=Conduent |accessdate=24 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 January 2017, Conduent formally came into existence following its separation from [[Xerox]].&lt;ref name="jamerson"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/xerox-stock-climbs-after-splitting-with-business-services-unit-1483461921 |title=Xerox Stock Climbs After Splitting With Business-Services Unit |first=Joshua |last=Jamerson |date=January 3, 2017 |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |accessdate=2017-01-04 |subscription=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the first quarter of 2017, [[Carl Icahn]] owned 9.7% of the company.&lt;ref name=Icahn/&gt;

A '''corporate promoter''' is a firm or person who does the preliminary work incidental to the formation of a company, including its [[promotion (marketing)|promotion]], [[Incorporation (business)|incorporation]], and [[Initial public offering|flotation]], and solicits people to invest money in the company, usually when it is being formed. An [[investment banker]], an [[underwriter]], or a [[stock promoter]] may, wholly or in part, perform the role of a promoter. Promoters generally owe a duty of utmost good faith, so as to not mislead any potential investors, and disclose all material facts about the company's business.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''[[Erlanger v New Sombrero Phosphate Co]]'' (1878) 3 App Cas 1218&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fiduciary duties==
Generally, promoters are in a [[fiduciary relationship]] with the company and its [[investor]]s and  [[shareholder]]s, and must avoid [[conflicts of interest]]s and exercise reasonable care in performing their duties. They must refrain from self-dealing or other types of abuse to take advantage of their position as a promoter.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Self-dealing occurs, for example, when a promoter unfairly profits from the conduct of business with the company by charging higher prices for the goods they sell to the company than it would otherwise pay.

A promoter can be a shareholder in the promoted company. If the promoter is the only shareholder, the company may, in compliance with the rule of the [[United States Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) and similar rules in other jurisdictions, need to disclose the information prior to selling shares to the public.

The fiduciary duties of promoters include:

* not to make any secret profit out of the promotion of the company. Secret profit is made by entering into a transaction on their own behalf and then selling the concerned property to the company at a profit, without disclosing the profit to the company or its members. Pomoters can make profits in dealings with the company, provided they discloses these profits to the company and its members.
* to make full disclosure to the company of all relevant facts, including any profit made by them in transactions with the company.

If a promoter fails to disclose the profits, made by him in the course of promotion or he knowingly makes a false statement in the prospectus, whereby the person relying on that statement, makes a loss, he will be liable to make good the loss, suffered by that other person. The promoter is liable for untrue statements, made in the prospectus.

A person, who subscribes for any shares or debenture in a company on the faith of the untrue statement contained in the prospectus, can sue the promoter for the loss or damages, sustained by the subscriber as the result of such untrue statement.

==Types of promoters==
Promoters may be classified into the following types.

===Professional promoters===
There are firms which specialise in company promotion, including its incorporation and flotation, before handing it over to the shareholders or their representatives for the company.

===Occasional promoters===
These promoters take interest in floating some companies. They are not engaged in promotion work on a regular basis. They take up the promotion of some company and once it is over they go to their original profession.For instance, engineers, lawyers etc. may float some companies.

===Entrepreneur promoters===
They are both promoters and entrepreneurs. They conceive the idea of a new business unit, do the groundwork to establish it and may subsequently become a part of the management.

===Financial promoters===
Some financial institutions, like investment banks or industrial banks, may take up the promotion of a company with a view to finding opportunities for investment.

==Functions of promoters==
The functions of a promoter may include:

===Discovery of a business idea===
The first stage in company promotion is the generation of new ideas. It is the promoter who conceives the idea of setting up a business, and makes an assessment of the viability of a particular aspects business be it technical feasibility ,financial feasibility ,economic feasibility and also incorporation of company .

===Detailed investigation===
Promoters undertakes a detailed investigation of the viability, profitability and future prospects of the growth of the proposed activity, and may seek the help of specialists such as lawyers, accountants, cost accountants, a company secretary, and engineers. Organisations engaged in market research and other specialised agencies. Specialists are in a position to make an objective analysis of their own areas which may help the promoters. Decisions have to be taken regarding the size, location, layout, manpower etc.

===Assembling the factors of production===
If the proposed endeavour gives promise of success and the promoter is willing to undertake the risk of forming the business, step must be taken to assemble various factors of production, such as land, labour, capital and managerial personnel. Assembly of resources involves making contracts for the purchase of these resources.promoters organise the resources to convert the idea into a reality by forming a company.

===Entering into preliminary contracts===
The promoter may enter into contracts with third parties in anticipation of the registration of a company; but after registration, the company must approve or confirm these contracts.

'''Customer intelligence''' ('''CI''') is the process of gathering and analyzing information regarding customers, and their details and activities, to build deeper and more effective [[customer relationship management|customer relationships]] and improve decision-making by vendors.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, Robert, Measuring and Valuing Customer Relationships (2000) Business Intelligence {{ISBN|978-1-898085-33-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==CRM==

Customer intelligence is a key component of effective [[customer relationship management]] (CRM), and when effectively implemented it is a rich source of insight into the behaviour and experience of a company's customer base. 

As an example, some customers walk into a store and walk out without buying anything. Information about these customers/prospects (or their visits) may not exist in a traditional CRM system, as no sales are entered on the store cash register. Although no commercial transaction took place, knowing ''why'' customers leave the store (perhaps by asking them, or a store employee, to complete a survey) and using this data to make inferences about customer behaviour, is an example of CI.

==Process==
Customer Intelligence begins with [[reference data]] – basic key facts about the customer, such as their geographic location.

This data is then supplemented&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oracle.com/oramag/profit/05-may/p25feature.html] Capturing Customer Intelligence – Oracle&lt;/ref&gt; with [[transaction data]] – reports of customer activity. This can be commercial information (for example purchase history from sales and order processing), interactions from service contacts over the phone and via e-mail.

A further subjective dimension can be added, in the form of customer satisfaction surveys or agent data. 

Finally, a company can use competitor insight and [[mystery shopping]] to get a better view of how their service benchmarks in the market.

By mining this data, and placing it in context with wider information about competitors, conditions in the industry, and general trends, information can be obtained about customers' existing and future needs, how they reach decisions, and predictions made about their future behavior.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crm2day.com/customer-intelligence/] Customer Intelligence by CRM Today&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.g2i.org/article/2005/09/customer-intelligence |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20090424045459/http://www.g2i.org/article/2005/09/customer-intelligence |archivedate=24 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example sources of data==

[[Speech analytics]] – used to monitor telephone conversations taking place between companies and customers, using [[phonetic analysis]] or [[speech recognition|speech to text]] to find keywords and phrases, classify call types and identify trends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nexidia.com/solutions/contact_center|title=404|first=|last=Nexidia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Mouse tracking|Click tracking]] – used to monitor the popularity and usage of corporate web sites, this data can provide clues to product interest and buying intention. For example, a company may infer a customer is interested in purchasing a particular service if they are spending time browsing specific product pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webtrends.com/Products/WebTrendsVisitorIntelligence.aspx|title=Digital Marketing Solutions - Webtrends|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Customer relationship management]] – software solutions used for [[Salesforce.com]], [[adeptcrmsales]] and to manage customer relationships which can store data on the quantity, type and category of customer and prospect contacts. 

Frontline data capture which may (or may not) form part of a CRM software solution, but which is used by front line agents to record more subjective data regarding customer contacts, such as the [[root cause]] of the customer picking up the phone (e.g. they received their bill) or their emotional state.

[[Customer satisfaction]] and [[market research]] surveys, often mined via [[text analytics]], which can additionally be applied, for customer intelligence purposes, to contact center notes, e-mail, and other textual sources.

==Benefits==

Customer intelligence provides a detailed understanding of the experience customers have in interacting with a company, and allows predictions to be made regarding reasons behind customer behaviors.

This knowledge can then be applied to support more effective and strategic decision making – for example, understanding why customers call makes it easier to predict (and plan to reduce) call volumes in a [[contact centre (business)|contact centre]].

'''Data monetization''', a form of [[monetization]], may refer to the act of generating measurable economic benefits from available data sources (analytics). Less commonly, it may also refer to the act of monetizing data services&lt;ref&gt;https://inform.tmforum.org/digital-transformation-and-maturity/2018/02/four-models-data-monetization/&lt;/ref&gt;. In the case of analytics, typically, these benefits accrue as revenue or expense savings, but may also include market share or corporate market value gains. Data monetization leverages data generated through business operations, available exogenous data or content, as well as data associated with individual actors such as that collected via electronic devices and sensors participating in the [[internet of things]]. For example, the ubiquity of the [[internet of things]] is generating [[location data]] and other data from sensors and [[mobile devices]] at an ever-increasing rate. When this data is collated against traditional databases, the value and utility of both sources of data increases, leading to tremendous potential to mine data for social good, research and discovery, and achievement of business objectives.  Closely associated with data monetization are the emerging [[data as a service]] models for transactions involving data by the data item.

There are three [[ethical]] and regulatory vectors involved in data monetization due to the sometimes conflicting interests of actors involved in the [[digital supply chain]].  The individual data creator who generates files and records through his own efforts or owns a device such as a sensor or a mobile phone that generates data has a claim to ownership of data.  The business entity that generates data in the course of its operations, such as its transactions with financial institutions or [[risk factors]] discovered through feedback from customers also has a claim on data captured through their systems and platforms. However, the person that contributed the data may also have a legitimate claim on the data.  Internet platforms and service providers, such as [[Google]] or [[Facebook]] that require a user to forgo some ownership interest in their data in exchange for use of the platform also have a legitimate claim on the data.  Thus the practice of data monetization, although common since 2000, is now getting increasing attention from regulators.  The [[European Union]] and the [[United States Congress]] have begun to address these issues.  For instance, in the financial services industry, regulations involving data are included in the [[Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act]] and [[Dodd-Frank]].  Some individual creators of data are shifting to using [[personal data vaults]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/y2014/0032267.html|title=User controlled system and method for collecting, pricing, and trading data|website=Freepatentsonline.com|accessdate=24 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and implementing [[vendor relationship management]] concepts as a reflection of an increasing resistance to their data being federated or aggregated and resold without compensation.  Groups such as the Personal Data Ecosystem Consortium,&lt;ref&gt;[http://personaldataecosystem.org]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140514024308/http://personaldataecosystem.org/ |date=2014-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Patient privacy]] [[privacy rights|rights]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://patientprivacyrights.org/|title=Patient Privacy Rights – Privacy is your right. We help make it happen.|website=Patientprivacyrights.org|accessdate=24 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others are also challenging corporate cooptation of data without compensation.

[[Financial services]] companies are a relatively good example of an industry focused on generating revenue by leveraging data.  [[Credit card]] issuers and [[retail banks]] use customer transaction data to improve targeting of [[cross-sell]] offers.  Partners are increasingly promoting merchant based [[reward programs]] which leverage a bank’s data and provide discounts to customers at the same time.

==Steps==
# Identification of available data sources – this includes data currently available for monetization as well as other external data sources that may enhance the value of what’s currently available.
# Connect, aggregate, attribute, validate, authenticate, and exchange data - this allows data to be converted directly into actionable or revenue generating insight or services.
# Set terms and prices and facilitate data trading - methods for data vetting, storage, and access. For example, many global corporations have locked and siloed data storage infrastructures, which stymies efficient access to data and cooperative and real-time exchange. 
# Perform [[Research]] and [[analytics]] – draw predictive insights from existing data as a basis for using data for to reduce [[risk]], enhance product development or performance, or improve [[customer experience]] or business outcomes.
# Action and leveraging – the last phase of monetizing data includes determining alternative or improved datacentric products, ideas, or services.  Examples may include real-time actionable triggered notifications or enhanced channels such as web or mobile response mechanisms.

==Pricing variables and factors==
*  A [[fee]] for 
**use of a platform to connect buyers and sellers
** use of a platform to configure, organize, and otherwise process data included in a data trade 
** connecting or including a device or sensor into a data supply chain
** connecting and credentialing a creator of a data source and a data buyer – often through a [[federated identity]]
** connecting a data source to other data sources to be included in a data supply chain
** use of an internet service or other transmission services for uploading and downloading data – sometimes, for an individual, through a [[personal cloud]]
** use of encrypted keys to achieve secure data transfer
** use of a search algorithm specifically designed to tag data sources that contain data points of value to the data buyer
** linking a data creator or generator to a data collection protocol or form
** server actions – such as a notification – triggered by an update to a data item or data source included in a data supply chain
*  A price or exchange or other [[trade value]] 
**assigned by a data creator or generator to a data item or a data source 
**offered by a data buyer to a data creator 
**assigned by a data buyer for a data item or a data source formatted according to criteria set by a data buyer
*  An incremental fee assigned by a data buyer for a data item or a data set scaled to the reputation of the data creator

==Benefits==
*  Improved decision-making that leads to [[real time (media)|real time]] [[crowd sourced]] research, improved profits, decreased costs, reduced risk and improved compliance
*  More impactful decisions (e.g., make real-time decisions)
*  More timely (lower latency) decisions (e.g., a vendor making purchase recommendations while the customer is still on the phone or in the store, a customer connecting with multiple vendors to discover the best price, triggered notifications when thresholds are reached for data values)
*  More granular decisions (e.g., localized pricing decisions at an individual or device or sensor level versus larger aggregates).
*Targeted Marketing (e.g., Vendors with access to big data can make targeted advertisements to specific customers within a set data pool decreasing costs for the advertiser and reaching most interested customers)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gartner.com/doc/3795764|title=Market Trends: Ways CSPs Can Exploit Location Data|last=|first=|date=|website=Gartner.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Frameworks==
There are a wide variety of industries, firms and business models related to data monetization.  The following frameworks have been offered to help understand the types of business models that are used:

Roger Ehrenberg of IA Ventures, a [[venture capital]] firm that invests in this sector, has defined three basic types of data product firms:
{{cquote|'''Contributory databases'''. The magic of these businesses is that a customer provides their own data in exchange for receiving a more robust set of aggregated data back that provides insight into the broader marketplace, or provides a vehicle for expressing a view. Give a little, get a lot back in return –  a pretty compelling value proposition, and one that frequently results in a payment from the data contributor in exchange for receiving enriched, aggregated data. Once these contributory databases are developed and customers become reliant on their insights, they become extremely valuable and persistent data assets.

'''Data processing platforms'''. These businesses create barriers through a combination of complex data architectures, proprietary algorithms, and rich analytics to help customers consume data in whatever form they please. Often these businesses have special relationships with key data providers, that when combined with other data and processed as a whole create valuable differentiation and competitive barriers. Bloomberg is an example of a powerful data processing platform. They pull in data from a wide array of sources (including their own homegrown data), integrate it into a unified stream, make it consumable via a dashboard or through an API, and offer a robust analytics suite for a staggering number of use cases. Needless to say, their scale and profitability is the envy of the industry.

'''Data creation platforms'''. These businesses solve vexing problems for large numbers of users, and by their nature capture a broad swath of data from their customers. As these data sets grow, they become increasingly valuable in enabling companies to better tailor their products and features and to target customers with highly contextual and relevant offers. Customers don’t sign up to directly benefit from the data asset; the product is so valuable that they simply want the features offered out-of-the-box. As the product gets better over time, it just cements the lock-in of what is already a successful platform. Mint was an example of this kind of business. People saw value in the core product. But the product continued to get better as more customer data was collected and analyzed. There weren’t network effects, per se, but the sheer scale of the data asset that was created was an essential element of improving the product over time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ehrenberg |first=Roger |title=Creating competitive advantage through data |url=http://www.iaventures.com/creating-competitive-advantage-through-data |publisher=IA Ventures' blog |accessdate=23 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203023719/http://www.iaventures.com/creating-competitive-advantage-through-data |archivedate=3 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Selvanathan and Zuk&lt;ref&gt;Big Data Realized: Developing New Data-Driven Products and Services to Drive Growth Perspective&lt;/ref&gt; offer a framework that includes "monetization methods that are outside the bounds of the traditional value capture systems employed by an enterprise... tuned to match the context and consumption models for the target customer."  They offer examples of "four distinct approaches: platforms, applications, data-as-a-service, and professional services."

==Examples==
*  Packaging of data (with analytics) to be resold to customers for things such as wallet share, [[market share]] and [[benchmarking]]
*  Integration of data (with analytics) into new products as a value-added differentiator such as [[On-Star]] for [[General Motors]] cars
* [[GPS]] enabled [[smartphones]]
* [[Geolocation]]-based offers and location discounts, such as those offered by [[Facebook]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/jan/31/facebook-places-deals-uk-europe|title=Facebook Places Deals to target local business ads in UK and Europe|first=Jemima|last=Kiss|date=31 January 2011|accessdate=24 August 2017|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Groupon]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2011/05/10/groupon-now-launches/|title=Say Hello to Groupon Now &amp; Right Here, Right Now Deals|first=Ben|last=Parr|website=Mashable.com|accessdate=24 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; are other prime examples of data monetization leveraging new emerging channels
* CRM based ad targeting and media attribution, such as those offered by Circulate
*Big Data based [[Marketing campaign|marketing campaigns]] like those offered by Instarea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gartner.com/doc/3795764|title=Market Trends: Ways CSPs Can Exploit Location Data|website=www.gartner.com|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intellectual property landscape==
Some of the patents issued since 2010 by the [[USPTO]] for monetizing data generated by individuals include; 8,271,346, 8,612,307, 8,560,464, 8,510,176, and 7,860,760.  These are usually in class 705 related to electronic commerce, data processing, and cost and price determination. Some of these patents use the term, the data supply chain to reflect emerging technology to federate and aggregate data in real time from many individuals and devices linked together through the [[internet of things]].  Another emerging term is [[information banking]].

An unexplored but potentially disruptive arena for data monetization is the use of [[Bitcoin]] [[micropayments]] for data transactions.  Because Bitcoins are emerging as competitors with payment services like Visa or PayPal that can readily enable and reduce or eliminate transaction costs, transactions for as little as a single data item can be facilitated. Consumers, as well as enterprises who desire to monetize their participation in a data supply chain, may soon be able to access social network enabled Bitcoin exchanges and platforms.&lt;ref&gt;Lomas, Natasha, Techcrunch, August 18, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Clickbait]] and data hijacking may wither as micropayments for data are ubiquitous and enabled. Potentially, even the current need to build out data broker managed data trading exchanges may be bypassed.  Stanley Smith,&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20140831030916/http://www.linkedin.com/pub/stan-smith/9/3ab/b37/] &lt;/ref&gt; who introduced the notion of the data supply chain, has said that simple micropayments for data monetization are the key to evolution of ubiquitous implementation of user configurable data supply schemata, enabling data monetization on a universal scale for all data creators, including the burgeoning internet of things.

'''Distribution''' (or '''place''') is one of the four elements of the [[marketing mix]]. Distribution is the process of making a product or service available for the consumer or business user that needs it. This can be done directly by the producer or service provider, or using indirect channels with distributors or [[intermediaries]]. The other three elements of the [[marketing mix]] are [[Product (business)|product]], [[pricing]], and [[promotion (marketing)|promotion]].

Decisions about distribution need to be taken in line with a company's overall strategic [[Vision statement|vision]] and [[Mission statement|mission]]. Developing a coherent distribution plan is a central component of [[strategic planning]]. At the strategic level, there are three broad approaches to distribution, namely mass, selective or exclusive distribution. The number and type of intermediaries selected largely depends on the strategic approach. The overall distribution channel should add value to the consumer.

==Definition==

Distribution is fundamentally concerned with ensuring that products reach target customers in the most direct and cost efficient manner. In the case of services, distribution is principally concerned with access.&lt;ref&gt;Dent, J., ''Distribution Channels: Understanding and Managing Channels to Market,'' Kogan Page, 2011, Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt; Although distribution, as a concept, is relatively simple, in practice distribution management may involve a diverse range of activities and disciplines including: detailed logistics, transportation, warehousing, storage, inventory management as well as channel management including selection of channel members and rewarding distributors.&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong,G., Adam, S., Denize, S. and Kotler, P., ''Principles of Marketing,'' Sydney, Australia, Pearson, 2014, pp 297-394&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution strategies==
Prior to designing a distribution system, the planner needs to determine what the distribution channel is to achieve in broad terms.  The overall approach to distributing products or services depends on a number of factors including the type of product, especially perishability; the market served; the geographic scope of operations and the firm's overall mission and vision. The process of setting out a broad statement of the aims and objectives of a distribution channel is a strategic level decision.

[[File:Target2398.jpg|thumb|In an intensive distribution approach, the marketer relies on chain stores to reach broad markets in a cost efficient manner.]]

Strategically, there are three approaches to distribution:&lt;ref&gt;Wright, R., ''Marketing: Origins, Concepts, Environment,'' Holborn, London, Thomson Learning, 1999, pp 250-251&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Mass distribution'' (also known as ''intensive distribution''): When products are destined for a mass market, the marketer will seek out intermediaries that appeal to a broad market base. For example, snack foods and drinks are sold via a wide variety of outlets including supermarkets, [[convenience store]]s, [[vending machine]]s, [[cafeteria]]s and others. The choice of distribution outlet is skewed towards those than can deliver mass markets in a cost efficient manner.

* ''Selective distribution:'' A manufacturer may choose to restrict the number of outlets handling a product. For example, a manufacturer of premium electrical goods may choose to deal with department stores and independent outlets that can provide added value service level required to support the product. Dr Scholl orthopedic sandals, for example, only sell their product through pharmacies because this type of intermediary supports the desired ''therapeutic'' positioning of the product. Some of the prestige brands of cosmetics and skincare, such as Estee Lauder, Jurlique and Clinique, insist that sales staff are trained to use the product range. The manufacturer will only allow trained clinicians to sell their products.

* ''Exclusive distribution:'' In an exclusive distribution approach, a manufacturer chooses to deal with one intermediary or one type of intermediary. The advantage of an exclusive approach is that the manufacturer retains greater control over the distribution process. In exclusive arrangements, the distributor is expected to work closely with the manufacturer and add value to the product through service level, after sales care or client support services. The most common type of exclusive arrangement an agreement between a supplier and a retailer granting the retailer exclusive rights within a specific geographic area to carry the supplier's product.&lt;ref&gt;Business Dictionary, http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/exclusive-distribution.html&lt;/ref&gt;


'''Summary of strategic approaches to distribution'''
{| class="wikitable"
|+
!Approach
! Definition
|-
| Intensive distribution
| The producer's products are stocked in the majority of outlets.&lt;ref name="kotler" /&gt;  This strategy is common for mass produced products such as basic supplies, snack foods, magazines and soft drink beverages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://inevitablesteps.com/marketing/intensive-distribution/ |title=Intensive Distribution: Definition, Strategy &amp; Examples |date=June 26, 2015 |publisher=Inevitable Steps |accessdate=February 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| Selective distribution
| The producer relies on a few intermediaries to carry their product.&lt;ref name="kotler" /&gt;  This strategy is commonly observed for more specialised goods that are carried through specialist dealers, for example, brands of craft tools, or large appliances.
|-
| Exclusive distribution
|The producer selects only very few intermediaries.&lt;ref name="kotler" /&gt;  Exclusive distribution occurs where the seller agrees to allow a single retailer the right to sell the manufacturer's products.  This strategy is typical of luxury goods retailers such as Gucci.
|}

===Push vs pull strategy ===

In consumer markets, another key strategic level decision is whether to use a push or pull strategy. In a ''push strategy'', the marketer uses intensive advertising and incentives aimed at distributors, especially retailers and wholesalers, with the expectation that they will stock the product or brand, and that consumers will purchase it when they see it in stores. In contrast, in a ''pull strategy'', the marketer promotes the product directly to consumers hoping that they will pressure retailers to stock the product or brand, thereby pulling it through the distribution channel.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, T.P., Lee, H.L. and Neale., J. J., ''The Practice of Supply Chain Management,'' Springer, 2003, {{ISBN|0-387-24099-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The choice of a push or pull strategy has important implications for advertising and promotion. In a push strategy the promotional mix would consist of trade advertising and sales calls while the advertising media would normally be weighted towards trade magazines, exhibitions and trade shows while a pull strategy would make more extensive use consumer advertising and sales promotions while the media mix would be weighted towards mass-market media such as newspapers, magazines, television and radio.&lt;ref&gt;Varey, E., ''Marketing Communication: A Critical Introduction,''Routledge, 2002, p. 295&lt;/ref&gt;

==Channels and intermediaries==
[[File:Wholesale fish market at Haikou New Port - 14.jpg|thumb|A wholesale fish market at Haikou, New Port]]

Distribution of products takes place by means of channels to become available on markets, in stores or in webshops. Channels are sets of interdependent organizers (called [[intermediaries]] or distributors) involved in making the product available for consumption to end-user.&lt;ref name=kotler&gt;Kotler, Keller and Burton, 2009. Marketing Management, Pearson Education Australia: Frenchs Forest&lt;/ref&gt; This is mostly accomplished through merchant retailers or wholesalers, or in international context by importers. In certain specialist markets, agents or brokers may become involved in distribution channel.  

Typical intermediaries involved in distribution include:

* '''Wholesaler:''' A merchant intermediary who sells chiefly to retailers, other merchants, or industrial, institutional, and commercial users mainly for resale or business use. Wholesalers typically sell in large quantities. (Wholesalers, by definition, do not deal directly with the public).&lt;ref&gt;Merriam-Webster Dictionary, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/wholesaler&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''Retailer:''' A merchant intermediary who sells direct to the public. There are many different types of retail outlet - from hypermarts and supermarkets to small, independent stores.
* '''Agent:''' An intermediary who is authorised to act for a principal in order to facilitate exchange. Unlike merchant wholesalers and retailers, agents do not take title to goods, but simply put buyers and sellers together. Agents are typically paid via commissions by the principal. For example, travel agents are paid a commission of around 15% for each booking made with an airline or hotel operator.
* '''Jobber:''' A special type of wholesaler, typically one who operates on a small scale and sells only to retailers or institutions. For example, rack jobbers are small independent wholesalers who operate from a truck, supplying convenience stores with snack foods and drinks on a regular basis.&lt;ref&gt;Merriam- Webster Dictionary, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/jobber&lt;/ref&gt;

==Channel design==

[[File:Distribution-levels.jpg|thumb|Types of distribution systems]]

A firm can design any number of channels they require to reach customers efficiently and effectively.  Channels can be distinguished by the number of intermediaries between producer and consumer.&lt;ref name=kotler/&gt; If there are no intermediaries then this is known as a ''zero-level'' distribution system or [[direct marketing]]. A ''level one'' (sometimes called ''one-tier'') channel has a single intermediary. A ''level two'' (alternatively a ''two-tier'') channel has two intermediaries, and so on. This flow is typically represented as being manufacturer to retailer to consumer, but may involve other types of intermediaries. In practice, distribution systems for perishable goods tend to be shorter - direct or single intermediary, because of the need to reduce the time a product spends in transit or in storage. In other cases, distribution systems can become quite complex involving many levels and different types of intermediaries.

==Channel mix==
In practice, many organizations use a mix of different channels; a direct sales force may call on larger customers may be complemented with agents to cover smaller customers and prospects. When a single organisation uses a variety of different channels to reach its markets, this is known as a ''multi-channel'' distribution network. In addition, online retailing or [[electronic commerce|e-commerce]] is leading to [[disintermediation]], the removal of intermediaries from a supply chain.  Retailing via smartphone or m-commerce is also a growth area.

==Managing channels==
The firm's marketing department needs to design the most suitable channels for the firm's products, then select appropriate channel members or intermediaries.  An organisation may need to train staff of intermediaries and motivate the intermediary to sell the firm's products.  The firm should monitor the channel's performance over time and modify the channel to enhance performance.

===Channel motivation===

To motivate intermediaries the firm can use positive actions, such as offering higher margins to the intermediary, special deals, premiums and allowances for advertising or display.&lt;ref name=kotler/&gt;  On the other hand, negative actions may be necessary, such as threatening to cut back on margin, or hold back delivery of product. Care must be exercised when considering negative actions as these may fall foul of regulations and can contribute to a public backlash and a public relations disaster.

===Channel conflict===
Channel conflict can arise when one intermediary's actions prevent another intermediary from achieving their objectives.&lt;ref name=kotler/&gt; Vertical channel conflict occurs between the levels within a channel, and horizontal channel conflict occurs between intermediaries at the same level within a channel. Channel conflict is a perennial problem. There are risks that a powerful channel member may coordinate the interests of the channel for personal gain.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, P.E., "George E Brenkert - Marketing Ethics," book review, ''Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews,'' 24 May, 2009 http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/marketing-ethics/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trends in distribution==

===Channel switching===

[[File:Inside a new officeworks store.jpg|thumb|right|The advent of "category killers", such as Australia's Officeworks, has contributed to an increase in channel switching behaviour.]]

Channel-switching (not to be confused with zapping or channel surfing on TV) is the action of consumers switching from one type of channel intermediary to a different type of intermediary for their purchases. Examples include switching from brick-and-mortar stores to online catalogues and e-commerce providers; switching from grocery stores to convenience stores or switching from top tier department stores to mass market discount outlets.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mospace.umsystem.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10355/5598/research.pdf|title=Explaining Consumers' Channel-Switching Behavior Using the Theory of Planned Behavior|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of factors have led to an increase in channel switching behaviour; the growth of e-commerce, the globalization of markets, the advent of [[Category killer]]s (such as Officeworks and Kids 'R Us) as well as changes in the legal or statutory environment. For instance, in Australia and New Zealand, following a relaxation of laws prohibiting supermarkets from selling therapeutic goods, consumers are gradually switching away from pharmacies and towards supermarkets for the purchase of minor analgesics, cough and cold preparations and complementary medicines such as vitamins and herbal remedies.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Morgan Research, "How Vital are Vitamins:, Research Finding No. 5503, Media Release, 14 March 2014 online: http://roymorgan.com.au/findings/5503-how-vital-are-vitamins-201403252241&lt;/ref&gt;

For the consumer, channel switching offers a more diverse shopping experience. However, marketers need to be alert to channel switching because of its potential to erode market share. Evidence of channel switching can suggest that disruptive forces are at play, and that consumer behaviour is undergoing fundamental changes. A consumer may be prompted to switch channels when the product or service can be found at cheaper prices, when superior models become available, when a wider range is offered, or simply because it is more convenient to shop through a different channel (e.g. online or one-stop shopping).&lt;ref&gt;Reardon, J., McCorkle, D.E. "A Consumer Model for Channel Switching Behavior", ''International Journal of Retail and Distribution Management'', Vol. 30, no. 4, pp.179 - 185&lt;/ref&gt; As a hedge against market share losses due to switching behaviour, some retailers engage in multi-channel retailing.&lt;ref&gt;Dholakia1, R.R., Zhao, M. and Dholakia, N., "Multichannel retailing: A case study of early experiences.," ''Journal of Interactive Marketing'', vol. 19, March, 2009, pp 63–74, DOI: 10.1002/dir.20035&lt;/ref&gt;

===Customer value===

The emergence of a [[service-dominant logic]] perspective has focussed scholarly attention on how distribution networks serve to create customer value and to consider how value is co-created by all the players within the distribution chain, including the value created by customers themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Flint, D. J., and Mentzer, J. T., "Striving for Integrated Value Chain Management Given a Service-dominant Logic for Marketing," In R. F. Lusch and S. L. Vargo (Eds.), ''The Service-dominant Logic of Marketing: Dialog, Debate, and Directions,'' Armonk, New York, ME Sharpe, 2006, pp 139–149; Tokman, M., and Beitelspacher, L. S., "Supply Chain Networks and Service-dominant Logic: Suggestions for Future Research," ''International Journal of Physical Distribution &amp; Logistics Management,'' Vol. 41, No. 7, pp 717-726; Yazdanparast, A., Manuj, I., and Swartz, S. M., ''Co-creating Logistics Value: A Service-Dominant Logic Perspective," ''International Journal of Logistics Management,'' Vol. 21, no. 3, 2010, pp 375-403.&lt;/ref&gt; This emphasis on value-creation is contributing to a change in terminology surrounding distribution processes; "distribution networks" are often termed ''value-chains'' while "distribution centres" are often termed ''customer fulfillment centres.'' For example, the retail giant Amazon, which utilises both direct online distribution alongside bricks and mortar stores, now calls its despatch centres "customer fulfillment centres".&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, J., "Amazon is Coming to Australia, and if these Projections are Correct, it’s Arrival is Going to be Massive," ''News.com,'' 29 April, 2017; Pearce, L., “Amazon: Everything You Need to Know about its Plans for Australia,” ''Huffington Post,'' 22 August, 2017 &lt;/ref&gt; Although the term, "customer fulfillment centre" has been criticised on the grounds that it is a [[neologism]], its use is becoming increasingly mainstream as it slowly makes its way into introductory marketing textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;See for example, "Placement: Customer Value Fulfilment," Chapter 10 in Gary Armstrong, Stewart Adam, Sara Denize, and Philip Kotler, ''Principles of Marketing,'' Asia-Pacific ed., Australia, Pearson, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disintermediation===

Disintermediation occurs when manufacturers or service providers eliminate intermediaries from the distribution network and deal directly with purchasers. Disintermediation is found in industries where radically new types of channel intermediaries displace traditional distributors. The widespread public acceptance of online shopping has been a major trigger for disintermediation in some industries. Certain types of traditional intermediaries are dropping by the wayside.&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, G., Adam, S., Denize, S. and Kotler, P., ''Principles of Marketing,'' Asia-Pacific ed., Australia, Pearson, 2014, pp 315-316&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Business administration}}

'''Online Business''' or '''e-business''' is any kind of business or commercial transaction that includes sharing information across the internet. [[Commerce]] constitutes the exchange of products and services between businesses, groups and individuals and can be seen as one of the essential activities of any business. Electronic commerce focuses on the use of [[Information and communications technology|ICT]] to enable the external activities and relationships of the business with individuals, groups and other businesses, while e-business refers to business with help of the [[internet]].&lt;ref&gt;Beynon-Davies P. (2004). E-Business. Palgrave, Basingstoke. {{ISBN|1-4039-1348-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "e-business" was coined by [[IBM]]'s marketing and Internet team in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Gerstner, L. (2002). ''Who says Elephants Can't Dance? Inside IBM's Historic Turnaround.'' pg 172. {{ISBN|0-06-052379-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The e-business (r)evolution |last=Amor |first=D. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1999 |publisher=[[Prentice Hall]] |location=Upper Saddle River |ISBN= |page= |pages= |URL= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1994, IBM, with its agency [[Ogilvy &amp; Mather]], began to use its foundation in IT solutions and expertise to market itself as a leader of conducting business on the Internet through the term "e-business."&lt;ref name = Pettit&gt;{{cite book |title = Learning From Winners: How the ARF Ogilvy Award Winners Use Market Research to Create Advertising Success | first = Raymond | last = Pettit | year = 2012 | publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis | ISBN = 9781136676765 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=cmvmTgt93vcC&amp;pg=PT32#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | pages = 32–33 |accessdate = 2014-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then CEO [[Louis V. Gerstner, Jr.]] was prepared to invest $1 billion to market this new brand.&lt;ref name="Meyer"&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=A2d0RXhp4Q0C&amp;pg=PA30 |title = The Fast Path to Corporate Growth: Leveraging Knowledge and Technologies to New Market Applimcations | page = 30 | first=Marc H. | last = Meyer | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2007 | ISBN=978-0195180862}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After conducting worldwide market research in October 1997, IBM began with an eight-page piece in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' that would introduce the concept of "e-business" and advertise IBM's expertise in the new field.&lt;ref name = Pettit/&gt; IBM decided ''not'' to trademark the term "e-business" in the hopes that other companies would use the term and create an entire new industry.&lt;ref name=Meyer/&gt; However, this proved to be too successful and by 2000, to differentiate itself, IBM launched a $300 million campaign about its "e-business infrastructure" capabilities.&lt;ref name=Meyer/&gt; Since that time, the terms, "e-business" and "e-commerce" have been loosely interchangeable and have become a part of the common vernacular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lowry|first1=Paul Benjamin|last2=Cherrington|first2=J. Owen|last3=Watson|first3=R. J.|title=E-Business Handbook|date=2001|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton, FL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business model==
{{Main|Business model}}

When organizations go online, they have to decide which e-business models best suit their goals.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Timers, (2000), Electronic Commerce - strategies &amp; models for business-to-business trading, pp.31, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd, {{ISBN|0-471-72029-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[business model]] is defined as the organization of product, [[Service (economics)|service]] and information flows, and the source of revenues and benefits for [[suppliers]] and [[customers]]. The concept of e-business model is the same but used in the online presence.

=== Revenue model ===
{{Main|Revenue model}}

A key component of the business model is the [[revenue model or profit model]], which is a framework for generating revenues. It identifies which revenue source to pursue, what value to offer, how to price the value, and who pays for the value. It is a key component of a company's business model. It primarily identifies what product or service will be created in order to generate revenues and the ways in which the product or service will be sold.

Without a well defined revenue model, that is, a clear plan of how to generate revenues, new businesses will more likely struggle due to costs which they will not be able to sustain. By having a clear revenue model, a business can focus on a target audience, fund development plans for a product or service, establish marketing plans, begin a line of credit and raise capital.

==== E-commerce ====
{{Main|E-commerce}}

E-commerce (short for "electronic commerce") is trading in products or services using computer networks, such as the Internet. Electronic commerce draws on technologies such as mobile commerce, electronic funds transfer, supply chain management, Internet marketing, online transaction processing, electronic data interchange (EDI), inventory management systems, and automated data collection. Modern electronic commerce typically uses the World Wide Web for at least one part of the transaction's life cycle, although it may also use other technologies such as e-mail.

While much has been written of the economic advantages of [[electronic commerce|Internet-enabled commerce]], there is also evidence that some aspects of the internet such as maps and [[Location awareness|location-aware service]]s may serve to reinforce [[economic inequality]] and the [[digital divide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=How the Internet Reinforces Inequality in the Real World  | work=The Atlantic | url=http://www.theatlanticcities.com/technology/2013/02/how-internet-reinforces-inequality-real-world/4602/  | author=Badger, Emily |date=6 February 2013 |accessdate=2013-02-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Electronic commerce may be responsible for [[Consolidation (business)|consolidation]] and the decline of [[mom-and-pop]], [[brick and mortar]] businesses resulting in increases in [[income inequality]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zdnet.com/e-commerce-will-make-the-shopping-mall-a-retail-wasteland-7000009960/ "E-commerce will make the shopping mall a retail wasteland"] ''ZDNet'', January 17, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comscore.com/Insights/Press_Releases/2012/12/Free_Shipping_Day_Promotion_Spurs_Late-Season_Online_Spending_Surge "‘Free Shipping Day’ Promotion Spurs Late-Season Online Spending Surge, Improving Season-to-Date Growth Rate to 16 Percent vs. Year Ago"] ''Comscore'', December 23, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theatlanticcities.com/jobs-and-economy/2012/12/death-american-shopping-mall/4252/ "The Death of the American Shopping Mall"] ''The Atlantic — Cities'', December 26, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Author [[Andrew Keen]], a long-time critic of the social transformations caused by the Internet, has recently focused on the economic effects of consolidation from Internet businesses, since these businesses employ much fewer people per dollar of sales than traditional retailers.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

===Security===
E-business systems naturally have greater [[network security|security]] risks than traditional business systems, therefore it is important for e-business systems to be fully protected against these risks. A far greater number of people have access to e-businesses through the internet than would have access to a traditional business. Customers, suppliers, employees, and numerous other people use any particular e-business system daily and expect their confidential information to stay secure. Hackers are one of the great threats to the security of e-businesses. Some common security concerns for e-Businesses include keeping business and customer information private and confidential, authenticity of data, and [[data integrity]]. Some of the methods of protecting e-business security and keeping information secure include physical security measures as well as data storage, data transmission, [[anti-virus software]], [[firewall (computing)|firewall]]s, and [[encryption]] to list a few.&lt;ref name="Pitts"&gt;University of Pittsburgh, comp. e-Business Resource Group Security Guidelines. Publication. 5 August 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="canada"&gt;Industry Canada| Industrie Canada. Industry Canada, 24 Aug. 2010. Web. 30 Nov. 2010. &lt;http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/dir-ect.nsf/eng/h_uw00348.html{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Privacy and confidentiality====
[[Confidentiality]] is the extent to which businesses makes personal information available to other businesses and individuals.&lt;ref name="west"&gt;Westfall, Joseph."Privacy: Electronic Information and the Individual." Santa Clara University. Markkula Center for Applied Ethics, 2010. Web. 30 Nov. 2010. &lt;http://www.scu.edu/ethics/publications/submitted/westfall/privacy.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; With any business, confidential information must remain secure and only be accessible to the intended recipient. However, this becomes even more difficult when dealing with e-businesses specifically. To keep such information secure means protecting any electronic records and files from unauthorized access, as well as ensuring safe transmission and data storage of such information. Tools such as encryption and firewalls manage this specific concern within e-business.&lt;ref name="canada" /&gt;

====Authenticity====
E-business transactions pose greater challenges for establishing authenticity due to the ease with which electronic information may be altered and copied. Both parties in an e-business transaction want to have the assurance that the other party is who they claim to be, especially when a customer places an order and then submits a payment electronically. One common way to ensure this is to limit access to a network or trusted parties by using a [[virtual private network]] (VPN) technology. The establishment of authenticity is even greater when a combination of techniques are used, and such techniques involve checking "something you know" (i.e. password or PIN), "something you need" (i.e. credit card), or "something you are" (i.e. [[digital signature]]s or [[Speaker recognition|voice recognition]] methods). Many times in e-business, however, "something you are" is pretty strongly verified by checking the purchaser's "something you have" (i.e. credit card) and "something you know" (i.e. card number).&lt;ref name="canada"/&gt;

====Data integrity====
Data integrity answers the question "Can the information be changed or corrupted in any way?" This leads to the assurance that the message received is identical to the message sent. A business needs to be confident that data is not changed in transit, whether deliberately or by accident. To help with data integrity, firewalls protect stored data against unauthorized access, while simply backing up data allows recovery should the data or equipment be damaged.&lt;ref name="canada" /&gt;

====Non-repudiation====
This concern deals with the existence of proof in a transaction. A business must have assurance that the receiving party or purchaser cannot deny that a transaction has occurred, and this means having sufficient evidence to prove the transaction. One way to address [[non-repudiation]] is using digital signatures.&lt;ref name="canada" /&gt; A digital signature not only ensures that a message or document has been electronically signed by the person, but since a digital signature can only be created by one person, it also ensures that this person cannot later deny that they provided their  signature.&lt;ref name="non"&gt;"What Is Nonrepudiation? - Definition." Information Security: Covering Today's Security Topics. TechTarget, 4 Sept. 2008. Web. 30 Nov. 2010. &lt;http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid14_gci761640,00.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Access control====
When certain electronic resources and information is limited to only a few authorized individuals, a business and its customers must have the assurance that no one else can access the systems or information. There are a variety of techniques to address this concern including firewalls, access privileges, user identification and authentication techniques (such as passwords and digital certificates), [[Virtual Private Network]]s (VPN), and much more.&lt;ref name="canada" /&gt;

====Availability====
This concern is specifically pertinent to a business' customers as certain information must be available when customers need it. Messages must be delivered in a reliable and timely fashion, and information must be stored and retrieved as required. Because availability of service is important for all e-business websites, steps must be taken to prevent disruption of service by events such as power outages and damage to physical infrastructure. Examples to address this include data backup, fire-suppression systems, Uninterrupted Power Supply (UPS) systems, virus protection, as well as making sure that there is sufficient capacity to handle the demands posed by heavy network traffic.&lt;ref name="canada" /&gt;

====Cost====
The business internet which supports e-business has a cost to maintain of about $2 trillion in outsourced IT dollars just in the United States alone.  With each website custom crafted and maintained in code, the maintenance burden is enormous.  In the twenty-first century, look for new businesses that will help standardize the look and feel of the internet presence of a business to be more uniform in nature to help reduce the cost of maintenance.

===Security solutions===

When it comes to security solutions, sustainable electronic business requires support for data integrity, [[strong authentication]], and [[privacy]].

====Access and data integrity====
There are several different ways to prevent access to the data that is kept online. One way is to use anti-virus software. This is something that most people use to protect their networks regardless of the data they have. '''E-businesses''' should use this because they can then be sure that the information sent and received to their system is clean.&lt;ref name="canada" /&gt;
A second way to protect the data is to use firewalls and network protection. A firewall is used to restrict access to private networks, as well as public networks that a company may use. The firewall also has the ability to log attempts into the network and provide warnings as it is happening. They are very beneficial to keep third-parties out of the network. Businesses that use Wi-Fi need to consider different forms of protection because these networks are easier for someone to access. They should look into protected access, virtual private networks, or internet protocol security.&lt;ref name="canada" /&gt;
Another option they have is an intrusion detection system. This system alerts when there are possible intrusions. Some companies set up traps or "hot spots" to attract people and are then able to know when someone is trying to hack into that area.&lt;ref name="canada" /&gt;

====Encryption====
[[Encryption]], which is actually a part of cryptography, involves transforming texts or messages into a code which is unreadable. These messages have to be decrypted in order to be understandable or usable for someone. There is a key that identifies the data to a certain person or company. With public key encryption, there are actually two keys used. One is public and one is private. The public one is used for encryption, and the private for decryption. The level of the actual encryption can be adjusted and should be based on the information. The key can be just a simple slide of letters or a completely random mix-up of letters. This is relatively easy to implement because there is software that a company can purchase. A company needs to be sure that their keys are registered with a certificate authority.&lt;ref name="canada" /&gt;

====Digital certificates====
The point of a [[digital certificate]] is to identify the owner of a document. This way the receiver knows that it is an authentic document. Companies can use these certificates in several different ways. They can be used as a replacement for user names and passwords. Each employee can be given these to access the documents that they need from wherever they are.
These certificates also use encryption. They are a little more complicated than normal encryption however. They actually used important information within the code. They do this in order to assure authenticity of the documents as well as confidentiality and data integrity which always accompany encryption.&lt;ref name="canada" /&gt;
Digital certificates are not commonly used because they are confusing for people to implement. There can be complications when using different browsers, which means they need to use multiple certificates. The process is being adjusted so that it is easier to use.&lt;ref name="canada" /&gt;

====Digital signatures====
A final way to secure information online would be to use a [[digital signature]]. If a document has a digital signature on it, no one else is able to edit the information without being detected. That way if it is edited, it may be adjusted for reliability after the fact. In order to use a digital signature, one must use a combination of cryptography and a message digest. A message digest is used to give the document a unique value. That value is then encrypted with the sender's private key.&lt;ref name="canada" /&gt;

== Purpose ==
Employee monitoring software is used to supervise employees' performance, prevent illegal activities, avoid confidential info leakage, catch insider threats. Nowadays employee monitoring software is widely used in technology companies.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

== Features ==
An employee monitoring program can monitor almost everything on a computer, such as keystrokes and passwords inputted, websites visited, chats in Facebook Messenger, Skype and other social chats. A piece of monitoring software can also capture screenshots of mobile activities. The administrator can view the logs through a cloud panel, or receive the logs by email.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Employee Monitoring Software features that matter|url=http://www.os-monitor.com/|website=OsMonitor|date=10 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notification ==
It may be better to inform employees in advance if the administrator plans to use employee monitoring software on employees' computers. In this way, employees may behave themselves well and try not to make mistakes.{{cn|date=November 2018}} In this case, employees can increase their efficiency and create more value for the company.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

'''Entrepreneur in Residence''' or '''Executive in Residence''' is a kind of position in [[venture capital]] firms, [[law firm]]s or [[business school]]s that is usually temporary and not formal. This is when an institution brings in an entrepreneur, who is usually in the process of starting or expanding his/her new company.&lt;ref&gt;An Entrepreneurial Life, (2013).

==Venture Capital firm==
In a Venture Capital firm the entrepreneur is funded to work with some of the [[investment]] team of the company as well as being exposed to business-building processes, where he/she can assist the firm with any existing portfolio. In addition he/she is expected to help the company evaluate new potential investments, especially if it is an area of the E.I.R's experience. 
On the other hand, the company usually benefits from this by getting significant access to the new company started by the E.I.R. This is due to the fact that the company gets to, usually, be the first investor in E.I.R's new company, giving them a chance to influence some company decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Festanstellung - Entrepreneur in Residence (m/w) - München, Berlin - www.etventure.com, (2014).

==Law Firm==
In a law firm scenario, the [[entrepreneur]] is expected to provide services to the firm’s clients who are also involved in entrepreneur activity. 
For a firm having an entrepreneur who can interact with other entrepreneurs and advise them is a way of gaining client trust by helping them with business decisions and networks.
In addition Law firms can also have the previous E.I.Rs as their clients once they start up their company. This is an easy and accessible [[clientele]] with whom the companies had previous relationships. 
This is a very beneficial relationship for the E.I.R, who will develop relationships with several other entrepreneurs, that could be potential partners in the future. The E.I.R gets a chance to show his/her knowledge and understanding to the law firm's client and will develop further relationships with any partners of the client's partner as well.

==Business School==
While in a Business school, an E.I.R is expected to provide guidance to business students who are intending to go through the same path as those who are helping them. The type of nurturing an E.I.R can provide to a 
business school environment helps students, professors or whoever wishes to start a business within the institution environment. The E.I.R helps them develop ideas, organize them and follow the right path towards making these ideas reality.
E.I.Rs are usually interested in these types of opportunities for several reasons, including expanding their own [[Curriculum vitae|CV]] through teaching and influence as well as developing relationships with future business owners who could be future partners of the E.I.R.&lt;ref&gt;http://www..gsb.columbia.edu, (2014).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2877">[[File:European-Parliament-of-Enterprises logo-RVB.jpg|thumb|European Parliament of Enterprises]]
'''The European Parliament of Enterprises''' (EPE) is an event for European corporations, organized by [[Eurochambres]], the Association of European Chambers of Commerce and Industry, once every two years. The first edition of the event was launched on 14 October 2008 on the occasion of Eurochambres' fiftieth anniversary.

==Concept==
The concept of the European Parliament of Enterprises originated from the consideration, that there is a democratic gap between the [[European institutions]] and the main actors of economic growth, entrepreneurs and that, consequently, European legislators do not sufficiently take into account entrepreneurs' concerns. 
On the other hand, businesses are largely unfamiliar with the role and functioning of the [[European Union]] and the significance that the institutions’ decisions can have on their activities and results.

==Participants==
751 entrepreneurs, or Members of the European Parliament of Enterprises (MEPEs), gather in the symbolic location of the [[Espace Léopold|Hemicycle]] of the [[European Parliament]]. The composition of the EPE reflects the number of Members of the European Parliament per member state.

==Aims and objectives==
The EPE aims to bring businesses and institutions face-to-face for one day so as to enhance mutual understanding. The EPE represents a unique opportunity for businesses to have a direct debate with high European representatives and to provide them with a direct bottom-up feedback on EU policy related issues.

==Votes==
During the EPE, Members of the European Parliament of Enterprises exercise their voting rights on major EU business-related issues.
The results of the votes are presented by Eurochambres to the relevant political interlocutors from all of the EU institutions as "the voice of European businesses”.
The "European Parliament of Enterprises” is organised with the active cooperation of Eurochambres' members, the national associations of [[Chamber of commerce|Chambers of Commerce &amp; Industry]].

==History==
At its introduction in October 2000, features of the software included "proprietary media delivery technology", a contact list to monitor online and offline status and to enable a one-click video chat session, control of picture size, frame rate, and audio performance, and other "media quality attributes".&lt;ref name="IntTel"/&gt; Services available for a paid subscription were to include "multi-party video conferencing -- up to six people, video messaging -- record, send, and play video messages, and web-based access -- initiate video chat session and view video messages from any browser."&lt;ref name="IntTel"/&gt;  At the time, Eyeball Networks stated that it intended "to charge fees for certain types of use of the Eyeball Chat System, and for the use of some of the features of the system"&lt;ref name="SUA2001"&gt;{{cite web

Upon its release, the software was described in the ''[[Washington Post]]'' as "the first Web video chat service I've tested that seems easy to use" and "similar to videoconferencing programs from Microsoft and other companies, but simpler, and it provides high-quality images."&lt;ref name="WashTech"&gt;{{cite news

[[Beta version]] 0.9 of Eyeball Chat LE was reviewed in ''Internet Telephony Magazine'', which stated, "the video and audio quality can be very good, especially with a first-rate camera. The settings are very customizable, and its floating interface has its pluses. For these reasons, and especially for the multi-party conferencing abilities", the software received the Editor's Choice award.&lt;ref name="IntTel"&gt;{{cite journal

Version 1.1 incorporated text messaging and window docking; version 1.21 (April 2001) incorporated better video capture and firewall support, call blocking, improved text messaging and web integration.&lt;ref name="Upgrade"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[PC Magazine]]'' May 2001 review of Eyeball Chat LE v1.21 approved of the product's "breadth of control", including image resizing, automatic or manual frame rate and quality adjustments, and its management features for call blocking, information privacy, and text chatting or video answering of calls. On the other hand, it was "not quite ready for prime time" because Internet congestion resulted in video and audio degradation, required multiple connection attempts, and the audio lag required speaking "at a deliberate pace, punctuated by pauses". Overall, "Eyeball chat should be graded on a curve", and it was deemed "pretty neat."&lt;ref name="PCMag"&gt;{{cite web

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Video message recording and sending were added, as was IM with AIM, MSN Messenger, and Yahoo! Messenger, and improved contact management and privacy settings.&lt;ref name="Upgrade"/&gt;

In its 2002 review, ''[[ZDNet]] UK'' gave Eyeball Chat 2.0 a score of 5.6 (out of 10). The program's connectivity to AIM, MSN, and Yahoo for sending recorded video messages, real-time video with other Eyeball users, and its installation simplicity were all listed as "pros", but its "hyped-to-the-hilt video-message delivery service"'s inability to interoperate from behind a firewall, lack of ICQ support, no private chat rooms, and "nearly nonexistent" technical support were listed as "cons". It worked "like a charm" with other Eyeball Chat users. The review summarized, "Eyeball Chat 2.0 promises more than it can deliver. For now, Trillian is a better interoperable messenger, since that client handles ICQ too. For video chat, turn to Yahoo Messenger; if you have Windows XP, go for Windows Messenger." &lt;ref name="ZDNet02"&gt;{{cite web

Version 2.1 of the software addressed some criticisms by improving firewall support for live video chat and video messaging, and "video adaptation",&lt;ref name="Upgrade"/&gt; and version 2.2 (August 2002) improved frame rates and audio, support for AIM, MSN, and Yahoo!, improved firewall support, and added new chat rooms.&lt;ref name="Upgrade"/&gt; In its August 2002 review, ''[[USA Today]]'' gave the program 3 out of 4 stars, noting that its video and audio quality was "snappier and sonically cleaner than the competition until Yahoo upgraded its product last week", but, without high-speed Internet connection, video was "virtually unwatchable."&lt;ref name="USAT"&gt;{{cite news

In its May 2011 review of Eyeball Chat 3.1, BSTDownload.com gave the software 4.5/5 stars, stating that it can "import buddies from other services like Google Talk, Yahoo Messenger and MSN", "supports drag-and-drop file sharing and video conferencing (5 simultaneous users maximum)," has picture-in-picture, and snapshots during video chat, can make audio-only PC to PC calls, has an "embedded address book," and supports custom avatars.  Detailed scores for resource usage: 29/35, ease of use: 19/20, look and feel: 9/10, and for functionality: 32/35.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 2011, version 3.2 was announced.&lt;ref name="3.2 Features"/&gt; The French ''Tom's Guide'' made note of the software's emphasis on video (as opposed to Windows Live Messenger) and the integration of phone list with contact list, and referred to the video and audio quality as "fluid and fast".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
The Dutch ''Personal Computer Magazine'' gave the software 2.5 (of 5) stars, called its microphone operation "slow" and the process of adding a contact "clumsy", disliked that the incoming call window is not automatically moved to the front of other windows, and that since Eyeball Chat does not use invitations (like Skype), it's not possible to see who is adding you to their contacts list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

On 13 May 2014, Eyeball Chat closed its chatrooms to all users, stating in the client software advert panel that this is "due to abuse of the system" although the client remains active and the remaining users can still communicate through private messaging, including voice and video chat. Constant attacks, exploits and third-party malicious clients have plagued Eyeballchat since version 2.2. New users remain able to sign up and download the client software.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8733">A '''for-profit corporation''' is an organization which aims to earn profit through its operations and is concerned with its own interests, unlike those of the public ([[non-profit corporation]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Business Dictionary| url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/for-profit-organization.html|accessdate=2014-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
A for-profit corporation is usually an organization operating in the [[private sector]] which sets aims that eventually help the organization itself.
This kind of a company makes [[shares]] of ownership available to the general public. The purchasers of those shares then become the company's [[shareholders]]; shareholders have bought a portion of ownership of the corporation by giving away certain amount of money (differentiating from company to company) or assets of a particular value. Such organizations are usually not aided by the government as they are working for private financial gains, unlike a [[non-profit organization]], which exists to serve a mission. The nature of a for-profit corporation is such that it is required to pay applicable taxes and register with the state. Any donation which they receive will also be subject to the tax policies of the concerned country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carter|first1=Christophia|title=For Profit vs Not-For-Profit Organization|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/profit-vs-not-for-profit-organization-4158.html|website=Small Business|publisher=Chron|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As these organizations are all corporations and have a separate identity from their owners the owners are not in their personal capacity required to satisfy any debts which the company might owe to anyone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Corporation Types |url=http://www.companiesinc.com/corporation/types.asp |website=Companies Incorporated |accessdate=22 October 2014 }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aims==
Unlike non-profit organizations the policies of these organizations are usually profit oriented. Managers(corporate employees) here have a profit oriented mindset and aim at maximising the revenue of the firm which in turn contributes to the dividends (in case of public limited) or profits of the shareholders/owners.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.boundless.com/management/textbooks/boundless-management-textbook/introduction-to-management-1/management-levels-and-types-18/management-in-different-business-types-for-profit-non-profit-and-mutual-benefit-122-5157/&lt;/ref&gt; Their aim can be accompanied by a goal of serving the society however that usually happens in cases of B-corporations.

==Popular models==
A for-profit corporation generally does mean an organization seeking profit however it has both modern forms and is also close to some other types of organizations as seen below.

===B-corporations===
A modern form of profit corporations exists in the form of B-Corporations. A number of for-profit corporations have opted to gain this status. Most organisations get this certificate in order to show their concern for the society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Abnett|first1=Kat|title=Fashion’s B Corporations Blend Business with Social Good|url=http://www.businessoffashion.com/2014/10/fashions-b-corporations-blend-business-social-good.html|website=businessoffashion.com/|publisher=The Business of Fashion|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A benefit corporation does aim to gain profit but also believes in playing a role for the society in terms of considering the environment or the society when crafting its policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Forester|first1=Drake|title=What is the Difference between a Nonprofit Organization and a Benefit Corporation?|url=https://www.score.org/resources/what-difference-between-nonprofit-organization-and-benefit-corporation|website=www.score.org|publisher=Score|accessdate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Their status is actually issued by a non-profit organization called B-Labs. They are accepted as legal entities in several states of the United States and legislations have been passed to ensure their legal status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Corporations|first1=B|website=https://www.bcorporation.net/what-are-b-corps/legislation|accessdate=2014-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proximity to LLCs===
A for-profit corporation can also be seen in context of a limited liability company as both of them have a very similar function. Both of them are common in a way as stakeholders in a for-profit corporation are called shareholders whereas a person who has stakes in a Limited Liability Company is referred to as a member. Subsequently, while corporations have a very defined hierarchy from corporate employees to board members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carter|first1=Christopher|title=LLC vs. For Profit Corporations|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/llc-vs-profit-corporations-17160.html|website=www.smallbusiness.chron.com|publisher=Chron|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==

===To the economy===
As these organizations aim to maximise profit they can be very healthy in an economy as the more they earn the greater is the amount they pay in taxes. That tax is eventually spent back on the people. Such corporations 
have the capacity to grow at a very fast rate and this eventually leads them to employing more people(lowering the employment burden on the government). Their profit maximisation motive also means that they will work on their productivity and will contribute to the GDP of any country they are living in. A higher GDP often leads to a higher living standard.

===To the business===
As the corporation only works for its own interest it gets the opportunity to isolate itself from all worldly matters and do what is best for itself. Here the grip of the owners can also be greater on the business as they have the free choice of making investments and decisions which will generate the greatest revenue for their business. Here they would not be obliged to consider any outer factor(welfare) while designing policies. More profit also means that they can invest the profit back to the business and increase its speed of growth.

==Difference between profit and not-for-profit==
The major distinction between these two organizations can be derived from their names as a non-profit organization does not seek any profit, does not pay any taxes as it works for the welfare of the society and reinvests any surpluses earned back to the business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NonProfit Organization|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/non-profitorganization.asp|website=www.investopedia.com|publisher=Investopedia|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast a for-profit corporation has no legal duty/obligation of working for the welfare of anyone but itself. This is the reason why a for-profit organization is not exempted any tax. Subsequently, at times running a not-for-profit corporation can be more difficult. Although both for and not-for-profit need a good decision making body however the aspect of serving the public puts an extra responsibility on the members of the board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rosenthal|first1=Leslie|title=Nonprofit Corporate Governance: The Board’s Role|url=http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/corpgov/2012/04/15/nonprofit-corporate-governance-the-boards-role/|website=Hravard Law Blog|publisher=The Harvard Law School Forum on  Corporate Governance and Financial Regulation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal parameters==
All for profit corporations in the United States fall under the jurisdiction of the [[Corporations Tax Act]] 2009. These companies are considered to be active for corporation tax purposes. This includes these corporations as they are trading or offering services(charged) to others, investing and are also dealing with the inflow and outflow of income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trading and non-trading for Corporation Tax explained|url=http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/ct/getting-started/trading.htm/|website=hmrc.gov.uk/|publisher=HM Revenue and Customs|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly the owners can also not be taken to the courts for some wrong committed by the company. The company can be represented  by a lawyer in a court of law. However like any other corporation it can not represent itself in a court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Booth|first1=Beresford|title=Corporations Cannot Represent Themselves In  Court|url=http://beresfordlaw.com/corporations-cannot-represent-themselves-in-court/|website=beresforlaw.com|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Geo-replication''' systems are designed to improve the distribution of data across geographically distributed [[Computer networking|data networks]]. This is intended to improve the response time for applications such as [[web portal]]s. Geo-replication can be achieved using software, hardware or a combination of the two. 

== Software ==
Geo-replication software is a [[network performance]]-enhancing technology that is designed to provide improved access to portal or [[intranet]] content for uses at the most remote parts of large organizations. It is based on the principle of storing complete replicas of portal content on local servers, and then keeping the content on those servers up-to-date using heavily compressed data updates.

=== Portal acceleration ===
Geo-replication technologies are used to provide replication of the content of portals, intranets, web applications, content and data between servers, across wide area networks [[Wide area network|WAN]] to allow users at remote sites to access central content at [[Local area network|LAN]] speeds. 

Geo-replication software can improve the performance of data networks that suffer limited [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]], [[Latency (engineering)|latency]] and periodic disconnection. [[Terabyte]]s of data can be replicated over a [[wide area network]], giving remote sites faster access to web applications.

Geo-replication software uses a combination of [[data compression]] and content [[web cache|caching]] technologies. [[Delta encoding|differencing]] technologies can also be employed to reduce the volume of data that has to be transmitted to keep portal content accurate across all servers. This update compression can reduce the load that portal traffic place on networks, and improve the response time of a portal.

=== Portal replication ===
Remote users of web portals and collaboration environments will frequently experience network bandwidth and latency problems which will slow down their experience of opening and closing files, and otherwise interacting with the portal. Geo-replication technology is deployed to accelerate the remote end user portal performance to be equivalent to that experienced by users locally accessing the portal in the central office.

=== Differencing engine technologies ===
To deliver this reduction in the size of the required data updates across a portal, geo-replication systems often use differencing engine technologies. These systems are able to difference the content of each portal server right down to the byte level. This knowledge of the content that is already on each server enables the system to rebuild any changes to the content on one server, across each of the other servers in the deployment from content already hosted on those other servers. This type of differencing system ensures that no content, at the byte level, is ever sent to a server twice.

=== Offline portal replication on laptops === 
Geo-replication systems are often extended to deliver local replication beyond the server and down to the laptop used by a single user. Server to laptop replication enables mobile users to have access to a local replica of their business portal on a standard laptop. This technology may be employed to provide in the field access to portal content by, for example, sales forces and combat forces.

==Location==

The subdistrict runs from [[Shennan Road]] at [[SEG Plaza]] near [[Huaqiang Road Station]] of the [[Shenzhen Metro]] for {{convert|1|km}} north to the Pavilion Hotel.
It is at the spine of a shopping district, with cross streets Zhenzhong Road ({{lang|zh|振中路}}), Zhenhua Road ({{lang|zh|振华路}}) and Zhenxing Road ({{lang|zh|振兴路}}). Huafa Road ({{lang|zh|华发路}}) is immediately parallel to the east with Yannan Road ({{lang|zh|燕南路}}) further away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bing.com/knows/search?q=%E5%8D%8E%E5%BC%BA%E5%8C%97&amp;qs=n&amp;form=QBRE&amp;pq=%E5%8D%8E%E5%BC%BA%E5%8C%97&amp;sc=8-3&amp;sp=-1&amp;sk=&amp;mkt=zh-cn |title=华强北 - Bing 网典 |publisher=Bing.com |date= |accessdate=2018-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sina.com.cn/c/2015-04-30/043931778371.shtml|title=华强北会是中国硅谷吗？|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The central area of the district is along Huaqiang Road ({{lang|zh|华强路}}), a busy pedestrian street which the district is named after.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcmap.com.cn/guangdong/futianqu_huaqiangbeijiedao.html|title=华强北街道介绍_广东深圳市福田区华强北街道地名网|website=www.tcmap.com.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Locale ==

The area is characterized by tree-lined streets with wide ({{convert|5|to|20|m}}) footpaths. Huaqiangbei is famous for its variety of electronics and clothing shops, though it has a notorious [[history]] of selling counterfeit and smuggled goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.tuxi.com.cn/dr/t/nth/nthjae.html|title=华强北手机批发市场见闻：水货、翻新机揭秘 - 突袭资讯|first=|last=IE=edge|website=news.tuxi.com.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sznews.com/zhuanti/node_113326.htm|title=华强北你还好吗？_深圳新闻网|website=www.sznews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.china.com.cn/2015-03/24/content_35140961.htm|title=华强北阵痛求变_新闻中心_中国网|first=|last=李林旭|website=news.china.com.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sznews.com/zhuanti/content/2012-08/13/content_7072822.htm|title=华强北“山寨手机”变身正规军_深圳新闻_深圳新闻网|first=|last=林毓瑾|website=www.sznews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Business administration}}An incident is an event that could lead to loss of, or disruption to, an organization's operations, services or functions. '''Incident management''' ('''IcM''') is a term describing the activities of an organization to identify, analyze, and correct hazards to prevent a future re-occurrence. These incidents within a structured organization are normally dealt with by either an [[incident response team]] (IRT), an [[incident management team]] (IMT), or [[Incident Command System]] (ICS). Without effective incident management, an incident can disrupt business operations, information security, IT systems, employees, customers, or other vital business functions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?itemId=1084688800&amp;r.l1=1073861197&amp;r.l2=1075408323&amp;r.l3=1084688133&amp;r.s=sc&amp;type=RESOURCES|title=What qualifies as an 'incident'? {{!}} Business Link|last=UK|first=Small Business Service, Kingsgate House, 66-74 Victoria Street, London SW1E 6SW,|website=webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-01-04|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110615004920/http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?itemId=1084688800&amp;r.l1=1073861197&amp;r.l2=1075408323&amp;r.l3=1084688133&amp;r.s=sc&amp;type=RESOURCES|archivedate=2011-06-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
An incident is an event that could lead to loss of, or disruption to, an organization's operations, services or functions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebci.org/glossary.pdf Glossary of Terms, The Business Continuity Institute Good Practice Guidelines 2010 Global Edition]. thebci.org Retrieved on 2015-09-03.&lt;/ref&gt; Incident management (IcM) is a term describing the activities of an organization to identify, analyze, and correct hazards to prevent a future re-occurrence. If not managed, an incident can escalate into an emergency, crisis or a disaster. Incident management is therefore the process of limiting the potential disruption caused by such an event, followed by a return to business as usual. Without effective incident management, an incident can disrupt business operations, information security, IT systems, employees, customers, or other vital business functions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Physical incident management ===

Incident management is considered to be much more than just the analysis of perceived threats and hazards towards and organization in order to work out the risk of that event occurring, and therefore the ability of that organization to conduct business as usual activities during the incident. An important part of risk management process and business resilience planning that Incident management is a real time physical activity.

The planning that has happened to formulate the response to an incident—be that a disaster, emergency, crisis or accident—has been done so that effective business resilience can take place to ensure minimal loss or damage whether that is to tangible or non tangible assets of that organization. Efficient physical management of the incident—making best use of both time and resources that are available and understanding how to get more resources from outside the organization when needed by clear and timely liaison—ensure the plan is implemented.

[[National Fire Protection Association]] states that incident management can be described as, '[a]n IMS [incident management system] is "the combination of facilities, equipment, personnel, procedures and communications operating within a common organizational structure, designed to aid in the management of resources during incidents".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nfpa.org/aboutthecodes/AboutTheCodes.asp?DocNum=1600&amp;cookie_test=1|title=List of NFPA Codes and Standards|date=2013|website=www.nfpa.org|language=en|access-date=10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ready.gov/business/implementation/incident|title=Incident Management {{!}} Ready.gov|date=2012|website=www.ready.gov|access-date=10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The physical incident management is the real time response that may last for hours, days, or longer. The [[Cabinet Office|United Kingdom Cabinet Office]] have produced the National Recovery Guidance (NRG), which is aimed at [[First responder|local responders]] as part of the implementation of the [[Civil Contingencies Act 2004]] (CCA). It describes the response as the following: "Response encompasses the actions taken to deal with the immediate effects of an emergency. In many scenarios, it is likely to be relatively short and to last for a matter of hours or days – rapid implementation of arrangements for collaboration, co-ordination and communication are, therefore, vital. Response encompasses the effort to deal not only with the direct effects of the emergency itself (eg fighting fires, rescuing individuals) but also the indirect effects (eg disruption, media interest)".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/national-recovery-guidance|title=National Recovery Guidance - GOV.UK|year=2007|website=www.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2004/36/contents|title=Civil Contingencies Act 2004|year=2012|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|language=en|others=Expert Participation|access-date=10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), which is the world's largest developer of international standards also makes a point in the description of its risk management, principles and guidelines document [[ISO 31000]]:2009 that, "Using ISO 31000 can help organizations increase the likelihood of achieving objectives, improve the identification of opportunities and threats and effectively allocate and use resources for risk treatment".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/iso31000.htm|title=ISO 31000 Risk management|year=2009|website=www.iso.org|language=en|access-date=13 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This again shows the importance of not just good planning but effective allocation of resources to treat the risk.

=== Computer security incident management ===
{{Main|Computer security incident management}}
Today, an important role is played by a Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT), due to the rise of internet crime, and is a common example of incident faced by companies in developed nations all across the world. For example, if an organization discovers that an intruder has gained unauthorized access to a computer system, the CSIRT would analyze the situation, determine the breadth of the compromise, and take corrective action. [[Computer forensics]] is one task included in this process. Currently, over half of the world’s hacking attempts on Trans National Corporations (TNCs) take place in North America (57%). 23% of attempts take place in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.technet.com/b/rhalbheer/archive/2010/03/12/hacking-incidents-2009-interesting-data.aspx Hacking Incidents 2009 – Interesting Data – Roger's Security Blog – Site Home – TechNet Blogs]. Blogs.technet.com (2010-03-12). Retrieved on 2012-11-17.&lt;/ref&gt; Having a well-rounded Computer Security Incident Response team is integral to providing a secure environment for any organization, and is becoming a critical part of the overall design of many modern networking teams.

== Roles ==
Incidents within a structured organization are normally dealt with by either an [[incident response team]] (IRT), or an [[incident management team]] (IMT). These are often designated beforehand or during the event, and are placed in control of the organization whilst the incident is dealt with, to restore normal functions.

The [[Incident Command System]] (ICS) is designed to deal with a larger incident involving a respond from multiple agencies. Popular with [[public safety]] agencies and jurisdictions in the United States, Canada and other countries, it is growing in practice in the private sector as organizations begin to manage without or co-manage emergencies with public safety agencies. ICS is a command and control mechanism that provides an expandable structure to manage emergency agencies.  Although some of the details vary by jurisdiction, ICS normally consists of five primary elements: command, operations, planning, logistics and finance/administration.  Several special staff positions, including public affairs, safety, and liaison, report directly to the incident commander (IC) when the emergency warrants establishment of those positions.

Another response system is the [[Gold–silver–bronze command structure]], which is used by emergency services in the United Kingdom and other countries. The system has three levels of command: a gold commander sets the overall strategy, a silver commander is in direct charge of those at the scene and bronze commanders direct responders on the ground. An individual agency may use the system, or multiple agencies may use the system as they liaise. A common feature of the ICS and Gold-Silver-Bronze systems is that they create a separate command system to the agencies' usual hierarchy.

Usually as part of the wider management process in private organizations, incident management is followed by post-incident analysis where it is determined why the incident happened despite precautions and controls. This analysis is normally overseen by the leaders of the organization, with the view of preventing repetition of the incident through precautionary measures and often changes in policy. This information is then used as feedback to further develop the security policy and/or its practical implementation. In the United States, the [[National Incident Management System]], developed by the [[Department of Homeland Security]], integrates effective practices in emergency management into a comprehensive national framework. This often results in a higher level of contingency planning, exercise and training, as well as an evaluation of the management of the incident.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dhs.gov/xabout/structure/gc_1230910518359.shtm About the Contingency Planning and Incident Management Division | Homeland Security] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402131642/https://www.dhs.gov/xabout/structure/gc_1230910518359.shtm |date=April 2, 2012 }}. Dhs.gov (1999-02-22). Retrieved on 2012-11-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Incident management software systems ==
Incident management software systems are designed for collecting consistent, time sensitive, documented [[incident report]] data. Many of these products include features to automate the approval process of an incident report or case investigation. These products may also have the ability to collect real time incident information such as time and date data. Additionally incident report systems will automatically send notifications, assign tasks and escalations to appropriate individuals depending on the incident type, priority, time, status and custom criteria. Modern products provide the ability for administrators to configure the Incident report forms as needed, create analysis reports and set access controls on the data.  These incident reports may have the ability for customization that may best suit the organizations using the systems. Some of these products have the ability to collect images, video, audio and other data. Incident management software systems exist that relate directly to specific industries.

== Root cause analysis ==
{{Main|root cause analysis}}

=== Human factors ===
{{One source|section
| date = January 2018
}}

During the [[root cause analysis]], human factors should be assessed. James Reason conducted a study into the understanding of adverse effects of human factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reason J | title = Understanding adverse events: human factors | journal = Quality in Health Care | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | pages = 80–9 | date = June 1995 | pmid = 10151618 | pmc = 1055294 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study found that major incident investigations, such as [[Piper Alpha]] and [[Kings Cross Underground fire|Kings Cross Underground Fire]], made it clear that the causes of the accidents were distributed widely within and outside the organization. There are two types of events: active failure—an action that has immediate effects and has the likelihood to cause an accident—and latent or delayed action—events can take years to have an effect and are usually combined with triggering events that then cause the accident.

Active failures are unsafe acts (errors and violations) committed by, for instance, the operators of machinery and supervisors of tasks. It is the people at the human-system interface whose actions can have immediate adverse consequences.

Latent failures are created as the result of decisions taken at the higher echelons of an organisation. Their damaging consequences may lie dormant for a long time, only becoming evident when they combine with local triggering factors (e.g., the [[spring tide]], the loading difficulties at [[Zeebrugge]] harbour, etc.) to breach the system's defences. Decisions taken in the higher echelons of an organization can trigger the events towards an accident becoming more likely, the planning, scheduling, forecasting, designing, policy making, etc., can have a slow burning effect. The actual unsafe act that triggers an accident can be traced back through the organization and the subsequent failures can be exposed, showing the accumulation of latent failures within the system as a whole that led to the accident becoming more likely and ultimately happening. Better improvement action can be applied, and reduce the likelihood of the event happening again.&lt;ref&gt;O’Callaghan, Katherine Mary, [http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp272.01032011/index.html Incident Management:  Human Factors and Minimising Mean Time to Restore] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110917053506/http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp272.01032011/index.html |date=2011-09-17 }}, Ph.D. Thesis, Australian Catholic University, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many '''advertising characters''' used as [[mascots]] and characters by companies in Australia and New Zealand are similar to those used in the [[List of American advertising characters|United States]] and the [[List of European and British advertising characters|United Kingdom]]. There are, however, quite a number that are unique to these two nations.

Many advertisements shown on New Zealand television are made in Australia, and many Australian and New Zealand companies operate similar businesses on both sides of the [[Tasman Sea]]. As such, there is considerable overlap in advertising characters and mascots found in the two countries.

The following is a list of notable mascots and characters created specifically for [[advertising]] purposes in Australia and New Zealand, listed alphabetically by the [[Product (business)|product]] they represent.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18213">A '''marketing information system''' ('''MKIS''') is a [[management information system]] (MIS) designed to support [[marketing]] [[decision making]]. Jobber (2007) defines it as a "system in which marketing data is formally gathered, stored, analysed and distributed to [[management|manager]]s in accordance with their informational needs on a regular basis." In addition, the online business dictionary defines Marketing Information System (MKIS) as "a system that analyzes and assesses marketing information, gathered continuously from sources inside and outside an organization or a store."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/marketing-information-system.html Marketing information system], Business Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, "an overall Marketing Information System can be defined as a set structure of procedures and methods for the regular, planned collection, analysis and presentation of information for use in making marketing decisions." (Kotler, at al, 2006)

== Overview ==
Reid and Bojanic(2010) claimed that, " The term market research informs relatively narrowerly than Marketing Information System(MkIS) which is altered from the term management information [[systemization]]. Market research indicates that information is not collected for a specific reason or project; the major objective is a one-time use. "&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Hospitality Marketing Management|last = Reid|first = Robert D.|publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons,Inc.|year = 2010|isbn = 9780470088586|location = New Jersey|pages = 209|last2 = Bojanic|first2 = David C.|edition = 5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"A marketing information system, which continuously collects the initial, routine and systematic data, is not only used for one particular topic but is designed for monitoring the degree of the marketing success to ensure the achievable of the operation as well."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Importance ==
Developing a MKIS system is becoming extremely important as the strength of economies rely on services and to better understand the specific needs of customers.   Kotler, et al. (2006) defined it more broadly as "people, equipment, and procedures to gather, sort, analyze, evaluate, and distribute needed, timely, and accurate information to marketing decision makers."&lt;ref name="Kotler"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kotler |first=Philip |authorlink= Philip Kotler |author2=Keller, Kevin Lane |authorlink2=Kevin Lane Keller  |editor= |others= |title=Marketing Management |origyear= |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= 12 |series= |year=2006 |publisher=Pearson Education |location= |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Insofar as an economy focuses on services, marketing is important to "monitor the marketing environment for changes in [[buyer behavior]] competition, technology, economic conditions, and government policies."&lt;ref&gt;Robert R. Harmon. (2003). Marketing Information Systems. Encyclopedia of Information Systems, Vol. 3. Elsevier Science (USA), 137-151.&lt;/ref&gt;   In this sense, the role of marketing is becoming pivotal for an organization to "adapt to changes in the market environment." (Harmon, 2003)

As an economy relies on the acquisition of knowledge, MkIS systems are necessary to be able to define and differentiate the [[value proposition]] that one organization provides with respect to another, as well as to define their [[competitive advantage]]. (Harmon, 2003)

The main benefit of MkIS systems is to integrate market-monitoring systems with strategy development and the strategic implementation of policies and processes that help capture and act on [[customer management]] applications with marketing [[decision support system]]s.  This area constitute [[Marketing intelligence]] that supports the analysis and market based activities that support customer relations and customer service with real time information with real time applications that support market based approaches.

=== Relevance of MkIS ===
Shajahan and arya(2004) stated that, "Demands for the MkIS can be expressed by three crucial developments. Firstly, when companies expand and diversify into new markets, both the companies and customer's point of view are needed to be handled by the marketing managers. Therefore, there would be greater need for marketing information. Secondly, when consumers obtain an increment in the level of their income, it causes a tendency for them to be more discriminating during the purchasing procedure. A full awareness of the points that drive a consumer prefer a brand and the points that distinguished his brand from that of the rivals should be obtained by the marketers. This awareness is possible only with the help of a well- designed effective MkIS. Thirdly, the development of the markets and the movement from price to non-price grounds of competition lead to an increase in the importance of adoption and implementation by the competitors and finding the response of the consumers towards them. Analyzing the needs for MkIS from a third person's angle, three more factors come to the forefront viz., the information explosion, increasing complexity in decision making and the technological developments. " &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Management Information Systems|last = Shajahan|first = S.|publisher = New Page International(P) Ltd.|year = 2004|isbn = 8122415490|location = India|pages = 99|last2 = Priyadharshini|first2 = R.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marketing Research(MR)and MkIS ===

In addition, "Great demand of information gathering for marketing decisions results in the need of attention by themselves.  Though marketing research information can be generated by studies, which are normally conducted in the market place whereas marketing information systems are designed to gather, integrate, process and distribute marketing information comprehensively from all sources, including that from marketing research. The contrasting characteristics of MkIS and MR are presented in Table 5.1 as shown below:

The business function of marketing is concerned more with the planning, promotion and sale of products in existing markets and the development of new products and new markets. Thus marketing performs a vital function in the operation of a business enterprise. Business firms who turned to computers have been able to perform vital marketing function effectively for organizations' growth in the face of global competition."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Main Structure ==
According to Robert Jamon (2003), MkIS systems are decomposed on four components: (1) user interfaces, (2) application software, (3) databases, and (4) system support.   The following is a description of each one of these components.

1. [[User interfaces]]. The essential element of the MAkINAS is the managers who will use the system and the interface they need to effectively analyze and use marketing information.  The design of the system will depend on what type of decision managers need to make.

2. [[Application software]]. These are the programs that marketing decision makers use to collect, analyze, and manage data for the purpose of developing the information necessary for marketing decisions.

3. [[Database marketing]]. A marketing database is a system in which marketing data files are organized and stored.

4. [[IBM System/34, 36 System Support Program|System support]]. This component consists of system managers who manage and maintain the system assets including software and hardware network, monitor its activities and ensure compliance with organizational policies.

Along with these components, MkIS systems include [[Marketing decision support system|Marketing Decision Support Systems]] (MDSS), which in turn rely on simple systems such as [[Microsoft Excel]], [[SPSS]], and on-line analytical tools that help collect data.  Data compiled for analysis is stored and processed from a [[data warehouse]], which is simply a [[Information repository|data repository]] system that helps store and further process data collected internally and externally. (Harmon, 2003)

=== Databases ===
From Pride and Ferrell (2010), "Internal database is a part of the most marketing information systems. In addition, it's relatively convenient for access and retrieve of information. A databases allow marketers to tap into an abundance of information useful in making marketing decisions: internal sales reports, newspaper articles, company news releases, government economic reports, bibliographies, and more, often accessed through a computer system."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Marketing|last = Pride|first = William M.|publisher = Cengage Learning,Inc.|year = 2010|isbn = 9780547167473|location = Canada|pages = 148|last2 = Ferrell|first2 = O.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Internal Data ====
In with Birn(2004), " internal data is a part of the data that is needed to be collect and handled by the marketing information system. Further more, managers regard this as a command to make effective operation.But getting the information that is really needed from a marketing information system depends on what the information is and how it is used. The following internal operating data are essential:
* Sales data, presented in a graphic format, can provide regular sales trend information and highlight whether certain customer types need to be targeted or focused.
* Price information by product line, compare with competitors, can monitor market trends; analyzed by customer type, it can check price trends in customer groups.
* Stock level data and trends in key accounts or distributors, focusing on whether different outlets need support, provide market share information.
* Market support information, coordinating the effects of marketing promotions, through advertising, direct marketing, trade incentives, consumer competitions and so on, helps to determine whether decisions are being made effectively.
* Competitive information, reviewing competitors'  promotions and communications to see if the company is doing it better or worse than competitors, can improve market targeting."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Effective Use of Market Research: How to Drive and Focus Better Business Decisions|last = Birn|first = Robin|publisher = Kogan Page Limited|year = 2004|isbn = 074944200X|location = Great Britain|pages = 22|edition = 4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Environmental scanning ===
Sandhusen(2000) defined that, environmental scanning is a display of the nature of MIS processed. " It gives assistance for the marketers to develop the strategies, policies, plans and to make programs and budgets through dealing with the ongoing information on trends."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Marketing|last = Sandhusen|first = Richard L.|publisher = Barron's Educational Series|year = 2000|isbn = 9780764112775|location = Canada|pages = 165|edition = 3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kotler's Model ===
According to Philip Kotler, the four components that comprise the MkIS system are Internal Reports (Records) System, Marketing Research System, Marketing Intelligence System, and Marketing Decision Support System

1.Internal Reports System: It records various data from different department of a company, which is regarded as a major source of information.

2.Marketing Intelligence System: It is a main source used by managers for gaining daily information of the external environment, hence assists the managers to react to the changing rapidly.

3.Marketing Research System: It is used to collect primary and secondary data, and displays the results in forms of reports.

4.Marketing Decision Support System: Compared to the supply of the data by the three previous systems, it focuses more on processing the data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.yourarticlelibrary.com/marketing/mis-marketing-information-system-with-diagram/48703/|title = MIS: Marketing Information System (With Diagram)|date = 2015|accessdate = 1 Nov 2015|website = YourArticleLibrary|publisher = |last = Jaideep|first = S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages , Limitations &amp; Possible Risks ==

=== Advantages ===
Bhasin stated that,"With an increasingly competitive and expanding market, the amount of information needed daily by an organization is profound. So they have to establish a Marketing Information system. There are several advantages of Marketing information systems

* '''Organized Data collection''' –  MkIS can help the managers to organize loads of data collected from the market, thus results in an increment in the productivity.
* '''A broad perspective''' –  With a proper MkIS in place, the organization can be tracked which can be used to analyze independent processes. This helps in establishing a broader perspective which helps us know which steps can be taken to facilitate improvement.
* '''Storage of Important Data''' – The storage of important data is essential in execution and thus proves again that MkIS is not important only for information but also for execution.
* '''Avoidance of Crisis''' – The best way to analyze a stock (share market) is to see its past performance. Top websites like moneycontrol thrive on MIS. Similarly MIS helps you keep tracks of margins and profits. With an amazing information system established, an organizations direction can be analysed and probably crises averted before they place. 
* '''Co-ordination''' –  Consumer durables and FMCG companies have huge number of processes which needs to be co-ordinated. These companies depend completely on MIS for the proper running of the organization.
* '''Analysis and Planning''' –  MkIS plays a crucial role in the planning process, considering the planning procedure requires information. For planning, the first thing which is needed is the organizations capabilities, then the business environment and finallycompetitor analysis. In a proper MkIS, all these are present by default and are continuously updated. Therefore, MkIS is very important for planning and analysis.
* '''Control''' –  Just like MkIS can help in a crisis, in normal times it provides control as you have information of the various processes going on and what is happening across the company."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.marketing91.com/customer-profitablity-analysis-2/|title = 8 Advantages of Marketing Information Systems|date = 23 Oct 2015|accessdate = 23 Oct 2015|website = Marketing 91|publisher = |last = Bhasin|first = Hitesh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Possible risks ===
"Nevertheless, the collection of marketing information should obey a high-frequent manner due to the rapid change in the external market." The possible risks the business may face if they disobey the manner according to Bhasin are:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.marketing91.com/mis-marketing-information-system/|title = MIS – Marketing information system|date = 23 Oct 2015|accessdate = 23 Oct 2015|website = Marketing 91|publisher = |last = Bhasin|first = Hitesh}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Opportunities may be missed.
* There may be a lack of awareness of environmental changes and competitors' actions.
* [[Data collection]] may be difficult to analyze over several time periods.
* Marketing plans and decisions may not be properly reviewed.
* Data collection may be disjointed.
* Previous studies may not be stored in an easy to use format.
* Time lags may result if a new study is required.
* Actions may be reactionary rather than anticipatory.

Maintenance, complexity and setting up a MkIS are one of the major hindrances to Marketing information systems. Furthermore, wrong information being fed in MkIS can become cumbersome and appropriate filters need to be established.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Limitations ===
Kotler and Philip have said that "both primary and secondary researches offer loads of the data and information needed for the marketers, whereas the secondary data sources are relatively superior in quick provision of data at lower cost. Simultaneously, a firm cannot find all the data required by itself, but sometimes can be done with the help of secondary research. However, researchers must assess those data collected from both primary and secondary data sources to enable the accuracy, updates and fairness.  Each primary data collection method – observational, survey, and experimental – has its own advantages and disadvantages. Similarly, each of the various research contact methods – mail, telephone, personal interview, and online – also has its own advantages and drawbacks." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Principles of Marketing|last = Kotler|first = Philip|publisher = Pearson Education,Inc.|year = 2010|isbn = 9780137006694|location = United States of America|pages = 153|last2 = Armstrong|first2 = Gary|edition = 13th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rural Marketing Information System (RuMIS) ==
A RuMIS is necessary not only for corporate organizations engaged in marketing of agricultural goods and manufactured goods intended for sales in rural areas. RuMIS is required also by the agriculturists and farmers who have enormous decis!ion-making to do.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Rural Marketing: Indian Perspective|last = Singh|first = Awadhesh Kumar|publisher = New Age International (P) Ltd.|year = 2005|isbn = 8122416837|location = India|pages = 114|last2 = Pandey|first2 = Satyaprakash}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''multidimensional organization''' is an organization that pursues its objectives simultaneously through multiple dimensions ([[Product (business)|product]], [[region]], [[Account manager|account]], [[Market segmentation|market segment]]).

The multidimensional organization was discussed as early as the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Goggin (1979)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ackoff, R. L. (1994).&lt;/ref&gt; It required the combination of the fall of costs of information, the development of dynamic multidimensional markets, and a new generation of workers and managers, to create this paradigm shift in organization forms.

== Introduction ==
The multidimensional organization exhibits the following:
#the overall [[Performance management|performance]] of the firm is reported simultaneously on multiple dimensions and on multiple levels;
#each of these dimensions has a [[Management|manager]] who is held [[Accountability|accountable]] for the contribution of his dimension to the overall performance;
#these managers depend on each other for required [[resource]]s; and
#these managers [[collective]]ly are accountable for the overall performance.

== Defining characteristics ==

*The most important reported [[profit center]] in its [[Accounting System|accounting system]] is the [[customer]], that is on top of a product or a region, as is common in the [[Strategic business unit|unit organization]].
*Transaction data is owned by a central [[Corporate headquarters|corporate office]], not by units or regions.
*Information regarding the performance of the firm, especially its position with customers, is available to all managers on the different dimensions (an absence of [[information asymmetry]]).
*Contrary to the unit organization, market opportunities and resources are organized under separate responsibilities to avoid risk averse behavior with respect to market opportunities

== Cause ==

The most basic reason for the rise of the multidimensional organization is that due to the fall in costs of [[information]], [[customers]] start to behave in multidimensional ways in terms of their preferences, in the ways in which they select and purchase [[goods and services]], make use of [[Distribution (business)|distribution channels]], etc. To answer this increasing variety in customer behavior, both in private consumers and between businesses, firms need to increase their internal variety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ashby|first=W. R.|author-link= W. Ross Ashby| title=An Introduction to Cybernetics|url=http://pcp.vub.ac.be/books/IntroCyb.pdf|accessdate=29 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The multidimensional organization also answers the emergence of multidimensional strategies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bartlett|first=C. A.|author-link1=Christopher A. Bartlett|author2=Ghoshal, S.|author-link2=Sumantra Ghoshal| title=Managing Across Borders: The Transnational Solution|journal=Harvard Business School Press|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which firms not only pursue [[Dominance (economics)|market dominance]] and superior efficiency, but also need to exploit economies of scale.

== Comparison to other organization forms ==

The multidimensional organization is a new organization form, compared to the U-form, the [[M-form]] and the H-form. It transcends the restrictions with the M-form or multi-unit organization, as well as the problems with the matrix-organization. Examples of firms with a multidimensional organization are IBM, Microsoft, and ASML.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ssrn.com |title=The Emergence of the Multidimensional Organization |author=Strikwerda, J. (2007) | author-link= Hans Strikwerda |accessdate=29 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Comparison to matrix organization ===

The differences between the multidimensional organization and the matrix organization can be summarized as below:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Matrix organization
! Multidimensional organization
|-
| One person may have two bosses, each with their own objectives
| Limited number of managers work n-D, most workers within modules in hierarchy; managers having one common challenge, the performance of the firm with customer C 
|-
| Products and regions are profit center
| Customer is the primary profit center
|-
| Transaction data is owned by regions
| Transaction data is owned by corporate headquarters
|-
| No shared performance information
| Shared information from trusted sources on performance; no information asymmetry
|-
| Transfer prices between dimensions
| No transfer of pricing between dimensions
|-
| No proper management process for planning &amp; control
| Clear management process, giving priority to most critical dimension
|-
| Based on economic model of unit organization
| Based on economic model of exploiting intangible assets in integrated firm
|}

=== Relating to ERP ===

The multidimensional organization implies specific requirements on how transactions are recorded in [[enterprise resource planning]] (ERP) systems, implicating a shift away from the traditional paradigm in IT-governance of business IT-alignment. Now transactions need to be recorded, not only multidimensional, to allow multiple consolidations to occur simultaneously. Particularly, the recording needs to be neutral with respect to business models. ERP systems tend to have a technical lifetime of 10–15 years, whereas business models last for 3–5 years.

The '''Oracle Big Data Appliance''' consists of hardware and software from [[Oracle Corporation]] sold as a [[computer appliance]]. It was announced in 2011, promoted for consolidating and loading unstructured data into [[Oracle Database]] software.

== History ==
Oracle announced the Oracle Big Data Appliance on October 3, 2011 at [[Oracle OpenWorld]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Oracle Digs in On NoSQL, Hadoop, End-to-End Big Data |work= Integration Developer News |author= Vance McCarthy |date= October 2011 |url= http://www.idevnews.com/stories/4858/Oracle-Digs-in-On-NoSQL-Hadoop-End-to-End-Big-Data |access-date= March 2, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
It was similar to the [[Oracle Exadata]] Database Machine and  announced with the Oracle Exalytics Business Intelligence Machine.&lt;ref name="OBA"&gt;{{cite web |author= Barb Darrow |title= Oracle BigData Appliance stakes big claim |date= October 3, 2011 |work= Giga Om |url= http://gigaom.com/2011/10/03/oracle-big-data-appliance-stakes-big-claim/ |accessdate= March 2, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original hardware components of the appliance consisted of a full rack configuration with 864GB of main memory and 432 TB of storage. A full rack consists of 18 servers nodes each of which had two 6-core Intel processors, 48 GB memory per node (upgradable to 96 GB or 144 GB), 12 x 2TB disks per node, InfiniBand Networking and 10 GbE connectivity.&lt;ref name="BBOR" /&gt;

== Software ==
The product includes an open-source distribution of [[Apache Hadoop]]. Support from [[Cloudera]] was announced in January 2012.&lt;ref name="CLO"&gt;{{cite web |author= Doug Henschen |title= Oracle Makes Big Data Appliance Move With Cloudera |work= Information Week |date= January 10, 2012 |url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/software/info_management/232400021 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120113011538/http://www.informationweek.com/news/software/info_management/232400021 |archivedate= January 13, 2012 |accessdate= March 2, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Oracle NoSQL Database]], [[Oracle Data Integrator]] with an adapter for Hadoop Oracle Loader for Hadoop, an open source distribution of [[R (programming language)|R]], [[Oracle Linux]], and [[HotSpot|Oracle Java Hotspot]] Virtual Machine were also mentioned in the announcement..&lt;ref name="BDE" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ORR"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kanaracus|first=Chris|title=Oracle Rolls Out 'Big Data' Appliance|url=http://www.cio.com/article/690884/Oracle_Rolls_Out_Big_Data_Appliance?page=1&amp;taxonomyId=3007|publisher=CIO|accessdate=30 December 2011|date=3 Oct 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2248">A '''power structure''' is an overall system of influence relationships between any individual and every other individual within any selected group of people. A description of a power structure would capture the way in which [[Power (social and political)|power]] or [[authority]] is distributed between people within groups such as a government, nation, institution, organization, or a society.&lt;ref&gt;G. William Domhoff, Thomas R. Dye, ''Power Elites and Organizations'' (1987), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Such structures are of interest to various fields, including [[sociology]], [[government]], [[economics]], and [[business]]. A power structure may be formal and intentionally constructed to maximize values like [[Social justice|fairness]] or [[efficiency]], as in a [[hierarchical organization]] wherein every entity, except one, is subordinate to a single other entity. Conversely, a power structure may be an informal set of roles, such as those found in a [[dominance hierarchy]] in which members of a social group interact, often aggressively, to create a ranking system. A culture that is organised in a dominance hierarchy is a [[dominator culture]], the opposite of an egalitarian culture of partnership. A visible, dominant group or elite that holds power or authority within a power structure is often referred to as being [[the Establishment]]. Power structures are fluid, with changes occurring constantly, either slowly or rapidly, evolving or revolutionary, peacefully or violently.

      <comment>/* Origins and background */ I do not thinl you can say that scholars "generally" hold that Penrose made a substantive contribution; two scholars have advanced this view, but the reality is that such a view is widely dismissed by scholars more generally; an article about RBV is simply not the place to debate Penrose's contributions to management theory; editors who want to do so should put their comments on Penrose's article directly</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18683">The '''resource-based view''' ('''RBV''') is a managerial framework used to determine the strategic resources with the potential to deliver comparative advantage to a firm. These resources can be exploited by the firm in order to achieve sustainable [[competitive advantage]].

Barney's 1991 article "Firm Resources and Sustained Competitive Advantage" is widely cited as a pivotal work in the emergence of the resource-based view. However, some scholars argue that there was evidence for a fragmentary resource-based theory from the 1930s. RBV proposes that firms are heterogeneous because they possess heterogeneous resources, meaning firms can have different strategies because they have different resource mixes.

The RBV focuses managerial attention on the firm's internal resources in an effort to identify those assets, capabilities and competencies with the potential to deliver superior competitive advantages.

==Origins and background==

During the 1990s, the ''resource-based view'' (also known as the ''resource-advantage theory'') of the firm became the dominant paradigm in strategic planning. RBV  can be seen as a reaction against the positioning school and its somewhat prescriptive approach which focused managerial attention on external considerations, notably [[Porter's five forces analysis|industry structure]]. The so-called positioning school had dominated the discipline throughout the 1980s. In contrast, the emergent resource-based view argued that the source of sustainable advantage derives from doing things in a superior manner; by developing superior capabilities and resources. [[Jay Barney]]'s article, "Firm Resources and Sustained Competitive Advantage" (1991), is seen as pivotal in the emergence of the resource-based view.&lt;ref name="prahalad1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Prahalad | first1 = C. K. | last2 = Hamel | first2 = G. | year = | title = The Core Competence of the Corporation | url = | journal = Harvard Business Review | volume = 68 | issue = 3| pages = 79–91 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A number of scholars point out that a fragmentary resource-based perspective was evident from the 1930s, noting that Barney was heavily influenced by Wernerfelt's earlier work which introduced the idea of resource position barriers being roughly analogous to entry barriers in the positioning school.&lt;ref name="priem1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Priem | first1 = R. L. | last2 = Butler | first2 = J. | year = | title = Is the Resource-Based 'View' a Useful Perspective for Strategic Management Research? | url = | journal = Academy of Management Review | volume = 26 | issue = 1| pages = 20–40 | doi=10.5465/amr.2001.4011928}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mahoney | first1 = J.T. | last2 = Pandian | first2 = J.R. | year = | title = The Resource-Based View Within the Conversation of Strategic Management | url = | journal = Strategic Management Journal | volume = 15 | issue = 5| pages = 363–380 | doi=10.1002/smj.4250130505}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars suggest that the resource-based view represents a new paradigm, albeit with roots in "Ricardian and Penrosian economic theories according to which firms can earn sustainable supranormal returns if, and only if, they have superior resources and those resources are protected by some form of isolating mechanism precluding their diffusion throughout the industry."&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, A. and Kipley, D., "Resource-Based View," in: Matthew R. Marvel (ed), ''Encyclopedia of New Venture Management,'' Sage Publications, 2012, p. 397, DOI: https://dx.doi.org/10.4135/9781452218571.n158 &lt;/ref&gt;  While its exact influence is debated, Edith Penrose's 1959 book ''The Theory of the Growth of the Firm'' is held by two scholars of strategy to state many concepts that would later influence the modern, resource-based theory of the firm.&lt;ref&gt;Edith Penrose's (1959) "Contributions to the Resource-based View of Strategic Management", Yasemin Y. Kor and Joseph T. Mahoney, ''Journal of  Management Studies'' 41:1 January 2004 0022-2380 http://www.business.illinois.edu/josephm/Publications/jms_kor%20and%20mahoney%20(2004).pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The RBV is an interdisciplinary approach that represents a substantial shift in thinking.&lt;ref name="fahy1"/&gt; The resource-based view is interdisciplinary in that it was developed within the disciplines of economics, ethics, law, management, marketing, supply chain management and general business.&lt;ref&gt; Hunt, S.D., "A General Theory of Business Marketing: R-A theory, Alderson, the ISBM Framework and the IMP Theoretical Structure," ''Industrial Marketing Management,'' Vol. 41, 2013, pp 283-293&lt;/ref&gt; 

RBV focuses attention on an organisation's internal resources as a means of organising processes and obtaining a competitive advantage. Barney stated that for resources to hold potential as sources of sustainable competitive advantage, they should be valuable, rare, imperfectly imitable and not substitutable (now generally known as ''VRIN'' criteria).&lt;ref&gt;Barney, J. B., "Firm Resources and Sustained Competitive Advantage." ''Journal of Management,'' Vol. 17, No. 1, 1991, pp. 99–120&lt;/ref&gt; The resource-based view suggests that organisations must develop unique, firm-specific core competencies that will allow them to outperform competitors by doing things differently.&lt;ref name="prahalad1"/&gt;

Although the literature presents many different ideas around the concept of the resource-advantage perspective, at its heart, the common theme is that the firm's resources are financial, legal, human, organisational, informational and relational; resources are heterogeneous and imperfectly mobile and that management's key task is to understand and organise resources for sustainable competitive advantage.&lt;ref&gt;Makadok, R., "Toward a Synthesis of the Resource-Based View and Dynamic-Capability Views of Rent Creation," ''Strategic Management Journal,'' Vol. 22, 2001, pp 387-401; Hunt, D. S. and Derozier, C., "The Normative Imperatives of Business and Marketing Strategy: Grounding Strategy in Resource-Advantage View," ''Journal of Business and Industrial Marketing,'' Vol. 19, No. 1, 2004, pp. 5–22&lt;/ref&gt; Key theorists who have contributed to the development of a coherent body of literature include [[Jay Barney|Jay B. Barney]], [[George S. Day]], [[Gary Hamel]], [[Shelby D. Hunt]], G. Hooley and [[C.K. Prahalad]].

== Concept ==

Achieving a sustainable competitive advantage lies at the heart of much of the literature in both strategic management and strategic marketing.&lt;ref name="fahy1"&gt;Fahy, J and Smithee, A. "Strategic Marketing and the Resource Based View of the Firm," ''Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science Review,'' Vol. 1999, 10, online at http://www.amsreview.org/articles/fahy10-1999.pdf or https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/025b/5aa7e682f4cbf1d7637a0bbe51a2a0d602e7.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The resource-based view offers strategists a means of evaluating potential factors that can be deployed to confer a competitive edge. A key insight arising from the resource-based view is that not all resources are of equal importance, nor possess the potential to become a source of sustainable competitive advantage.&lt;ref name="fahy1"/&gt; The sustainability of any competitive advantage depends on the extent to which resources can be imitated or substituted.&lt;ref&gt;Lowson, R., "The Nature of Operations Strategy: Combining Strategic Decisions from an Operations and Market based Perspective," ''Management Decision,'' Vol. 41, No, 6, pp.  538–49&lt;/ref&gt; Barney and others point out that understanding the causal relationship between the sources of advantage and successful strategies can be very difficult in practice.&lt;ref&gt;Barney, J. B., "Firm Resources and Sustained Competitive Advantage," ''Journal of Management,'' Vol. 17, No. 1, 1991, pp. 108–09; Barney uses the term "causally ambiguous" which he describes as a situation when "the link between the resources controlled by the firm and the firm's sustained competitive advantage is not understood or understood only very imperfectly."&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a great deal of managerial effort must be invested in identifying, understanding and classifying core competencies. In addition, management must invest in organisational learning to develop, nurture and maintain key resources and competencies.

In the resource-based view, strategists select the strategy or competitive position that best exploits the internal resources and capabilities relative to external opportunities. Given that strategic resources represent a complex network of inter-related assets and capabilities, organisations can adopt many possible competitive positions. Although scholars debate the precise categories of competitive positions that are used, there is general agreement, within the literature, that the resource-based view is much more flexible than Porter's prescriptive approach to strategy formulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Day | first1 = G.S. | last2 = Wensley | first2 = R. | year = 1988 | title = Assessing Advantage: A Framework for Diagnosing Competitive Superiority | url = | journal = Journal of Marketing | volume = 52 | issue = | pages = 1–26 | doi=10.2307/1251261}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Day | first1 = G. S. | year = 1994 | title = The Capabilities of Market-Driven Organizations | url = | journal = Journal of Marketing | volume = 58 | issue = | pages = 37–52 | doi=10.2307/1251915}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hooley | first1 = G. J. | last2 = Greenley | first2 = G. E. | last3 = Fahy | first3 = J. | last4 = Cadogan | first4 = J. W. | year = 2001 | title = Market-focused Resources, Competitive Positioning and Firm Performance | url = | journal = Journal of Marketing Management | volume = 17 | issue = 5–6| pages = 503–520 | doi=10.1362/026725701323366908}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The key managerial tasks are:

1)   Identify the firm’s potential key resources.

2)   Evaluate whether these resources fulfill the following criteria (also known as ''VRIN'' criteria:&lt;ref&gt;Prahalad, C. K. and Hamel, G., "The Core Competence of the Corporation," ''Harvard Business Review,'' Vol. 68, No. 3, pp. 79–91; Barney, J. B., "Firm Resources and Sustained Competitive Advantage," ''Journal of Management,'' Vol. 17, No. 1, 1991, pp. 99–120&lt;/ref&gt;

* Valuable - they enable a firm to implement strategies that improve its efficiency and effectiveness.
* Rare - not available to other competitors.
* Imperfectly imitable - not easily implemented by others.
* Non-substitutable - not able to be replaced by some other non-rare resource.

3) Develop, nurture and protect resources that pass these evaluations.

== Definitions ==

Given the centrality of resources in terms of conferring competitive advantage, the management and marketing literature carefully defines and classifies resources and capabilities.

=== Resources ===

Barney  defines firm resources as: "all [[assets]], capabilities, organizational processes, firm attributes, information, knowledge, etc. controlled by a firm that enable the firm to conceive of and implement strategies that improve its efficiency and effectiveness” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Barney | first1 = J.B. | year = 2001 | title = Is the Resource-Based "View" a Useful Perspective for Strategic Management Research? | url = | journal = Academy of Management Review | volume = 26 | issue = 1| page = 101 | doi = 10.5465/AMR.2001.4011938 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Capabilities===

Capabilities are “a special type of resource, specifically an organizationally embedded non-transferable firm-specific resource whose purpose is to improve the productivity of the other resources possessed by the firm.” &lt;ref&gt;Makadok, R., "Toward a Synthesis of the Resource-Based View and Dynamic-Capability Views of Rent Creation," ''Strategic Management Journal,'' Vol. 22, 2001, No. 5, pp. 387–401 &lt;/ref&gt;

=== Competitive advantage===

Barney defined a [[competitive advantage]] as "when [a firm] is able to implement a “value creating strategy not simultaneously being implemented by any current or potential competitors.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Barney | first1 = J.B. | year = 2001 | title = Is the Resource-Based "View" a Useful Perspective for Strategic Management Research? | url = | journal = Academy of Management Review | volume = 26 | issue = 1| page = 102 | doi = 10.5465/AMR.2001.4011938 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classification of resources and capabilities===

Firm-based resources may be tangible or intangible.

: ''Tangible resources'' include: physical assets such as financial resources and human resources including real estate, raw materials machinery, plant, inventory, brands, patents and trademarks and cash.&lt;ref&gt;Andriessen, D., ''Making Sense of Intellectual Capital: Designing a Method  for the Valuation of Intangibles,''  Elsevier Butterworth-Heinemann, Burlington, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;
: ''Intangible resources'' may be embedded in organisational routines or practices such as an organization's reputation, culture, knowledge or know-how, accumulated experience, relationships with customers,  suppliers or other key stakeholders.&lt;ref&gt;Lev, B., ''Intangibles:    Management,  Measurement, and Reporting,'' Brookings Institution Press, Washington,, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

==RBV and strategy formulation==

Firms in possession of a resource, or mix of resources that are rare among competitors, are said to have a ''comparative advantage.'' This comparative advantage enables firms to produce marketing offerings that are either (a) perceived as having superior value or (b) can be produced at lower costs. Therefore, a comparative advantage in resources can lead to a competitive advantage in market position.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, S.D. and Morgan, R.M., "The Comparative Advantage of the Firm," ''Journal of Marketing, Vol. 59, April, 1995, pp 1-15&lt;/ref&gt;

In the resource-based view, strategists select the strategy or competitive position that best exploits the internal resources and capabilities relative to external opportunities. Given that strategic resources represent a complex network of inter-related assets and capabilities, organisations can adopt many possible competitive positions. Although scholars debate the precise categories of competitive positions that are used, there is general agreement, within the literature, that the resource-based view is much more flexible than Porter's prescriptive approach to strategy formulation. Hooley et al. suggest the following classification of competitive positions:&lt;ref&gt;Hooley, G., Broderick, A. and Moller, K., "Competitive Positioning and the Resource-Based View of the Firm," ''Journal of Strategic Marketing,'' Vol. 6, 1998, pp. 97–115&lt;/ref&gt;

:* Price positioning
:* Quality positioning
:* Innovation positioning
:* Service positioning
:* Benefit positioning
:* Tailored positioning (one-to-one marketing)

== Criticisms ==
A number of criticisms of RBV have been widely cited,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Barney | first1 = J.B. | year = 2001 | title = Is the Resource-Based "View" a Useful Perspective for Strategic Management Research? | url = | journal = Academy of Management Review | volume = 26 | issue = 1| pages = 41–56 | doi = 10.5465/AMR.2001.4011938 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and are as follows:

* The RBV is [[Tautology (logic)|tautological]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Collis | first1 = D. J. | year = | title = Research Note: How Valuable Are Organizational Capabilities? | url = | journal = Strategic Management Journal | volume = 1994 | issue = | pages = 143–152 | doi=10.1002/smj.4250150910}}; {{cite journal | last1 = Priem | first1 = R.L. | last2 = Butler | first2 = J.E. | year = | title = Tautology in the Resource-Based View and Implications of Externally Determined Resource Value: Further Comments | url = | journal = Academy of Management Review | volume = 26 | issue = 1| pages = 57–66 | doi=10.5465/amr.2001.4011946}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Different resource configurations can generate the same value for firms and thus would not be competitive advantage {{cn|date=January 2018}}
* The role of product markets is underdeveloped in the argument &lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal | last1 = Priem | first1 = R.L. | last2 = Butler | first2 = J.E. | year = | title = Is the Resource-Based Theory a Useful Perspective for Strategic Management Research? | url = | journal = Academy of Management Review | volume = 26 | issue = 1| pages = 22–40 | doi=10.5465/amr.2001.4011928}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The theory has limited prescriptive implications.&lt;ref name="priem1"/&gt;

Other criticisms include:

* The failure to consider factors surrounding resources; that is, an assumption that they simply exist, rather than a critical investigation of how key capabilities are acquired or developed.&lt;ref&gt;Stinchcombe, A.L., "On Equilibrium, Organizational Form, and Competitive Strategy, in Joel A.C. Baum, Frank Dobbin (eds), ''Economics Meets Sociology in Strategic Management (Advances in Strategic Management),'' Volume 17, Emerald Group Publishing Limited, pp 271 - 284&lt;/ref&gt;
* It is perhaps difficult (if not impossible) to find a resource which satisfies all of Barney's VRIN criteria.
* An assumption that a firm can be profitable in a highly competitive market as long as it can exploit advantageous resources does not always hold true. It ignores external factors concerning the industry as a whole; [[Porter 5 forces analysis|Porter’s Industry Structure Analysis]] ought also be considered.&lt;ref&gt;Rumelt, R. P., "How Much does Industry Matter?" ''Strategic Management Journal,'' Vol. 12, No. 3, 1991, pp. 167-185&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SWOT en.svg|thumb|A SWOT analysis, with its four elements in a 2×2 matrix.]]
'''SWOT analysis''' (or '''SWOT matrix''') is a strategic planning technique used to help a person or organization identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats related to  [[business]] competition or project planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SWOT Analysis: Discover New Opportunities, Manage and Eliminate Threats|url=http://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTMC_05.htm|accessdate=24 February 2018|language=en|date=1006|website=www.mindtools.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is intended to specify the objectives of the business venture or project and identify the internal and external factors that are favorable and unfavorable to achieving those objectives. Users of a SWOT analysis often ask and answer questions to generate meaningful information for each category to make the tool useful and identify their competitive advantage. SWOT has been described as the tried-and-true tool of strategic analysis.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Strategic Management|last=Dess|first=Gregory|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2018|isbn=9781259927621|location=United States|pages=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Strengths and weakness are frequently internally-related, while opportunities and threats commonly focus on the external environment. The name is an acronym for the four parameters the technique examines:
* '''''S'''trengths'': characteristics of the business or project that give it an advantage over others.
* '''''W'''eaknesses'': characteristics of the business that place the business or project at a disadvantage relative to others.
* '''''O'''pportunities'': elements in the environment that the business or project could exploit to its advantage.
* '''''T'''hreats'':  elements in the environment that could cause trouble for the business or project.
The degree to which the internal environment of the firm matches with the external environment is expressed by the concept of [[strategic fit]]. Identification of SWOTs is important because they can inform later steps in planning to achieve the objective. First, decision-makers should consider whether the objective is attainable, given the SWOTs. If the objective is ''not'' attainable, they must select a different objective and repeat the process.

Some authors credit SWOT to [[Albert S. Humphrey|Albert Humphrey]], who led a convention at the Stanford Research Institute (now [[SRI International]]) in the 1960s and 1970s using data from [[Fortune 500]] companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sri.com/sites/default/files/brochures/dec-05.pdf|title=SWOT Analysis for Management Consulting|last=Humphrey|first=Albert|date=December 2005|work=SRI Alumni Newsletter|publisher=[[SRI International]]|authorlink=Albert S. Humphrey}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tamplc.com/Humphsprofile.htm|title=Albert Humphrey The "Father" of TAM|publisher=TAM UK|accessdate=2012-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Humphrey himself did not claim the creation of SWOT, and the origins remain obscure.

== Internal and external factors ==
SWOT analysis aims to identify the key internal and external factors seen as important to achieving an objective. SWOT analysis groups key pieces of information into two main categories:

# Internal factors — the ''strengths'' and ''weaknesses'' internal to the organization
# External factors — the ''opportunities'' and ''threats'' presented by the environment external to the organization

Analysis may view the internal factors as strengths or as weaknesses depending upon their effect on the organization's objectives.  What may represent strengths with respect to one objective may be weaknesses (distractions, competition) for another objective.  The factors may include all of the [[marketing mix|4Ps]] as well as [[personnel]], [[finance]], [[manufacturing]] capabilities, and so on.

The external factors may include [[macroeconomic]] matters, [[technological change]], [[legislation]], and sociocultural changes, as well as changes in the marketplace or in competitive position.  The results are often presented in the form of a [[Table (information)|matrix]].

SWOT analysis is just one method of [[categorization]] and has its own weaknesses. For example, it may tend to persuade its users to compile lists rather than to think about actual important factors in achieving objectives. It also presents the resulting lists uncritically and without clear prioritization so that, for example, weak opportunities may appear to balance strong threats.

It is prudent not to eliminate any candidate SWOT entry too quickly. The importance of individual SWOTs will be revealed by the value of the strategies they generate.  A SWOT item that produces valuable strategies is important.  A SWOT item that generates no strategies is not important.

== Use ==
The usefulness of SWOT analysis is not limited to [[For-profit corporation|profit-seeking organizations]].  SWOT analysis may be used in any decision-making situation when a desired end-state (objective) is defined.  Examples include [[non-profit organizations]], governmental units, and individuals. SWOT analysis may also be used in pre-crisis planning and preventive [[crisis management]]. SWOT analysis may also be used in creating a recommendation during a [[viability study]]/survey.

=== Strategy building ===
SWOT analysis can be used effectively to build organizational or personal strategy.  Steps necessary to execute strategy-oriented analysis involve identification of internal and external factors (using the popular 2x2 matrix), selection and evaluation of the most important factors, and identification of relations existing between internal and external features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Blake |first1=Martin |last2=Wijetilaka |first2=Shehan |date=26 February 2015 |title=5 tips to grow your start-up using SWOT analysis |url=http://www.brw.com.au/p/entrepreneurs/tips_to_grow_your_start_up_using_eQEF8Pm8l2Q9hME9TBXvVL |location=Sydney |access-date=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance, strong relations between strengths and opportunities can suggest good conditions in the company and allow using an ''aggressive'' strategy. On the other hand, strong interactions between weaknesses and threats could be analyzed as a potential warning and advice for using a ''defensive'' strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Osita |first=Christian |last2=Onyebuchi |first2=Idoko |last3=Justina |first3=Nzekwe |date=31 January 2014 |title=Organization's stability and productivity: the role of SWOT analysis |url=http://journalijiar.com/uploads/2014-10-02_231409_710.pdf |publisher=International Journal of Innovative and Applied Research (2014) |volume=2 |issue=9 |pages=23–32 |access-date=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Matching and converting ===
One way of using SWOT is matching and converting. Matching is used to find [[competitive advantage]] by matching the strengths to opportunities. Another tactic is to convert weaknesses or threats into strengths or opportunities. An example of a conversion strategy is to find new markets. If the threats or weaknesses cannot be converted, a company should try to minimize or avoid them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shsu.edu/~mkt_ssm/mkt570/Chap04.ppt See for instance: Mehta, S. (2000) ''Marketing Strategy'']&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Corporate planning ===
As part of the development of strategies and plans to enable the organization to achieve its objectives, that organization will use a systematic/rigorous process known as [[corporate planning]]. SWOT alongside [[PEST analysis|PEST]]/[[PESTLE]] can be used as a basis for the analysis of business and environmental factors.&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong. M. A handbook of Human Resource Management Practice (10th edition) 2006, Kogan Page, London {{ISBN|0-7494-4631-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Set objectives — defining what the organization is going to do
* Environmental scanning
** Internal appraisals of the organization's SWOT — this needs to include an assessment of the present situation as well as a portfolio of products/services and an analysis of the product/service lifecycle
* Analysis of existing strategies — this should determine relevance from the results of an internal/external appraisal. This may include [[gap analysis]] of environmental factors
* Strategic Issues defined — key factors in the development of a corporate plan that the organization must address
* Develop new/revised strategies — revised analysis of strategic issues may mean the objectives need to change
* Establish [[critical success factor]]s — the achievement of objectives and strategy implementation
* Preparation of operational, resource, projects plans for strategy implementation
* Monitoring all results — mapping against plans, taking corrective action, which may mean amending objectives/strategies&lt;ref name=arms&gt;Armstrong.M  Management Processes and Functions, 1996, London CIPD  {{ISBN|0-85292-438-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marketing ===
{{Main|Marketing management}}
In many competitor analysis, marketers build detailed profiles of each competitor in the market, focusing especially on their relative competitive strengths and weaknesses using SWOT analysis. Marketing managers will examine each competitor's cost structure, sources of profits, resources and competencies, competitive positioning and product differentiation, degree of [[vertical integration]], historical responses to industry developments, and other factors.

Marketing management often finds it necessary to invest in research to collect the data required to perform accurate marketing analysis. Accordingly, management often conducts market research (alternately marketing research) to obtain this information. Marketers employ a variety of techniques to conduct market research, but some of the more common include:
* Qualitative marketing research such as focus groups
* Quantitative marketing research such as statistical surveys
* Experimental techniques such as test markets
* Observational techniques such as ethnographic (on-site) observation
* Marketing managers may also design and oversee various environmental scanning and competitive intelligence processes to help identify trends and inform the company's marketing analysis.

Below is an example SWOT analysis of a market position of a small management consultancy with specialism in HRM.&lt;ref name=arms /&gt;

== In community organization ==
The SWOT analysis has been used in community work as a tool to identify positive and negative factors within organizations, communities, and the broader society that promote or inhibit successful implementation of social services and social change efforts.&lt;ref name="community tool box"&gt;{{cite web |title=Community Toolbox: Section 14. SWOT analysis |url=http://ctb.ku.edu/en/table-of-contents/assessment/assessing-community-needs-and-resources/swot-analysis/main |accessdate=2014-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used as a preliminary resource, assessing strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats in a community served by a nonprofit or community organization.&lt;ref name="social work" /&gt; This organizing tool is best used in collaboration with community workers and/or community members before developing goals and objectives for a program design or implementing an organizing strategy. The SWOT analysis is a part of the planning for social change process and will not provide a strategic plan if used by itself.  After a SWOT analysis is completed, a social change organization can turn the SWOT list into a series of recommendations to consider before developing a strategic plan.&lt;ref name="our community"&gt;{{cite web |title=Our Community |url=https://www.ourcommunity.com.au/boards/boards_article.jsp?articleId=1369 |accessdate=16 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SWOT Analysis ssw 1.png|thumb|one example of a SWOT Analysis used in community organizing]]
[[File:SWOT Analysis ssw 2.png|thumb|A simple SWOT Analysis used in Community Organizing]]

'''Strengths and weaknesses''' (''internal factors within an organization''):&lt;ref name="community tool box" /&gt;
* Human resources — staff, volunteers, board members, target population
* Physical resources — your location, building, equipment
* Financial — grants, funding agencies, other sources of income
* Activities and processes — programs you run, systems you employ
* Past experiences — building blocks for learning and success, your reputation in the community

'''Opportunities and threats''' (''external factors stemming from community or societal forces''):&lt;ref name="community tool box" /&gt;
* Future trends in your field or the culture
* The economy — local, national, or international
* Funding sources — foundations, donors, legislatures
* Demographics — changes in the age, race, gender, culture of those you serve or in your area
* The physical environment —is your building in a growing part of town? Is the bus company cutting routes?
* Legislation — do new federal requirements make your job harder...or easier?
* Local, national, or international events

Although the SWOT analysis was originally designed as an organizational method for business and industries, it has been replicated in various community work as a tool for identifying external and internal support to combat internal and external opposition.&lt;ref name="community tool box" /&gt; The SWOT analysis is necessary to provide direction to the next stages of the change process.&lt;ref name=BOOK&gt;{{cite book |last=Birkenmaier |first=Julie |title=The Practice of Generalist Social Work |year=2001 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been used by community organizers and community members to further social justice in the context of Social Work practice.

=== Application in community organization ===

As mentioned [[SWOT analysis#top|above]], SWOT can be crucial to determining the success of a project, while factoring in funding, as well as accessibility and logic. Often, a city will spend a year weighing the [[Risk-benefit]]s&lt;ref&gt;[[Pittsburg, California]] tried this out recently with the BART program. Citation: (Document). Pittsburg City, California, www.ci.pittsburg.ca.us/Modules/ShowDocument.aspx?documentid.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Urban Analysis of Urmia, Iran |url=http://rrrs.reviste.ubbcluj.ro/arhive/Artpdf/v10n22014/RRRS10220145.pdf |website=Reviste}}&lt;/ref&gt; of a project before they even vote on it.
==== Elements to consider ====
Elements to consider in a SWOT analysis include understanding the community that a particular organization is working with. This can be done via public forums, listening campaigns, and informational interviews. Data collection will help inform the community members and workers when developing the SWOT analysis. A needs and assets assessment is tooling that can be used to identify the needs and existing resources of the community. When these assessments are done and data has been collected, an analysis of the community can be made that informs the SWOT analysis.&lt;ref name="community tool box" /&gt;

==== Steps for implementation ====
A SWOT analysis is best developed in a group setting such as a work or community meeting. A facilitator can conduct the meeting by first explaining what a SWOT analysis is as well as identifying the meaning of each term.&lt;ref name="community tool box" /&gt;

One way of facilitating the development of a SWOT analysis includes developing an example SWOT with the larger group then separating each group into smaller teams to present to the larger group after set amount of time.&lt;ref name="community tool box" /&gt; This allows for individuals, who may be silenced in a larger group setting, to contribute. Once the allotted time is up, the facilitator may record all the factors of each group onto a large document such as a poster board, and then the large group,  as a collective, can go work through each of the threats and weaknesses to explore options that may be used to combat negative forces with the strengths and opportunities present within the organization and community.&lt;ref name="community tool box" /&gt; A SWOT meeting allows  participants to creatively brainstorm, identify obstacles, and possibly strategize solutions/way forward to these limitations.

==== When to use SWOT analysis ====
The uses of a SWOT analysis by a community organization are as follows: to   organize information, provide insight into barriers&lt;ref name="use and misuse"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chermack |first=Thomas J. |author2=Bernadette K. Kasshanna |title=The Use of and Misuse of SWOT analysis and implications for HRD professionals |journal=Human Resource Development International |date=December 2007 |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=383–399}}&lt;/ref&gt;  that may be present while engaging in social change processes, and identify strengths available that can be activated to counteract these barriers.

''A SWOT analysis can be used to:''
* Explore new solutions to problems &lt;ref name="community tool box" /&gt;
* Identify barriers that will limit goals/objectives &lt;ref name="community tool box" /&gt;
* Decide on direction that will be most effective &lt;ref name="community tool box" /&gt;
* Reveal possibilities and limitations for change&lt;ref name="community tool box" /&gt;
* To revise plans to best navigate systems, communities, and organizations
* As a brainstorming and recording device as a means of communication&lt;ref name="use and misuse" /&gt;
* To enhance "credibility of interpretation" to be used in presentation to leaders or key supporters.&lt;ref name="social work"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Westhues |first=Anne |author2=Jean Lafrance |author3=Glen Schmidt |title=A SWOT analysis of social work education in Canada |journal=Social Work Education: The International Journal |year=2001 |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=35–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Benefits and advantages ===
The SWOT analysis in social work practice framework is beneficial because it helps organizations decide whether or not an objective is obtainable and therefore enables organizations to set achievable goals, objectives, and steps to further the social change or community development effort.&lt;ref name=benefits&gt;{{cite web |last=Quincy |first=Ronald |title=SWOT Analysis: Raising capacity of your organization |url=http://socialwork.rutgers.edu/Libraries/Huamin/Brochure_2.sflb |publisher=Rutgers School of Social Work |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417010302/http://socialwork.rutgers.edu/libraries/huamin/brochure_2.sflb |archivedate=2016-04-17 |accessdate=2013-02-25 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It enables organizers to take visions and produce practical and efficient outcomes that effect long-lasting change, and it helps organizations gather meaningful information to maximize their potential.&lt;ref name="benefits" /&gt; Completing a SWOT analysis is a useful process regarding the consideration of key organizational priorities, such as gender and cultural diversity and fundraising objectives.&lt;ref name="change agency"&gt;{{cite web |title=Campaigners Toolkit: Strategy |publisher=The Change Agency |url=http://www.thechangeagency.org/campaigners-toolkit/training-resources/strategy/ |accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limitations ==
Some findings from Menon et al. (1999)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Menon, A. |title=Antecedents and Consequences of Marketing Strategy Making |journal=Journal of Marketing |volume=63 |pages=18–40 |year=1999 |doi=10.2307/1251943 |jstor=1251943 |issue=2 |publisher=American Marketing Association |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Hill and Westbrook (1997)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hill, T. &amp; R. Westbrook |title=SWOT Analysis: It’s Time for a Product Recall |journal=Long Range Planning |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=46–52 |year=1997 |doi=10.1016/S0024-6301(96)00095-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested that SWOT may harm performance and that "no-one subsequently used the outputs within the later stages of the strategy". 

Other critiques include the misuse of the SWOT analysis as a technique that can be quickly designed without critical thought leading to a misrepresentation of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats within an organization's internal and external surroundings.&lt;ref name="SWOT does not need to be recalled"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Koch |first=Adam |title=SWOT does not need to be recalled: It needs to be enhanced |journal=Swineburne University of Technology |year=2000 |url=http://www.westga.edu/~bquest/2000/swot1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a firm becomes preoccupied with a single strength, such as cost control, they can neglect their weaknesses, such as product quality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Another limitation includes the development of a SWOT analysis simply to defend previously decided goals and objectives. This misuse leads to limitations on brainstorming possibilities and "real" identification of barriers. This misuse also places the organization’s interest above the well-being of the community. Further, a SWOT analysis should be developed as a collaborative with a variety of contributions made by participants including community members. The design of a SWOT analysis by one or two community workers is limiting to the realities of the forces, specifically external factors, and devalues the possible contributions of community members.&lt;ref name="use and misuse" /&gt;

Overall, managers should remember that SWOT is a starting point for discussion and cannot, in itself, show managers how to achieve a competitive advantage.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Because the SWOT analysis is a snapshot of the firm at a particular moment in time, the analysis might obscure the fact that both the internal and external environment are rapidly changing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== The SVOR alternative ==

In project management, the alternative to SWOT known by the acronym SVOR (Strengths, Vulnerabilities, Opportunities, and Risks) compares the project elements along two axes: internal and external, and positive and negative. It takes into account the mathematical link that exists between these various elements, considering also the role of infrastructures. The SVOR table provides an intricate understanding of the elements at play in a given project:&lt;ref&gt;Mesly, Olivier (2017). ''Project feasibility – Tools for uncovering points of vulnerability.'' New York, NY:Taylor and Francis, CRC Press, 546 pages,  9 {{ISBN|9781498757911}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Constraints consist of: calendar of tasks and activities, costs, and norms of quality. The "''k''" constant varies with each project (for example, it may be valued at 1.3).{{cn|date=February 2018}}{{efn|Best source I could find is https://ceopedia.org/index.php/SWOT_analysis but seems unrelated.}}

== SWOT analysis in popular culture ==
=== Ads ===
Many reports have been published about the use of SWOT by real life companies, and how the idea is spreading.{{which|date=October 2018}} [[Coca-Cola (company)|Coca-Cola]] has used this in their television ads&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.valueline.com/Stocks/Highlights/The_Coca-Cola_Company__A_Short_SWOT_Analysis.aspx#.Wo36ULeov4g|title=Value Line - The Most Trusted Name in Investment Research|publisher=Value Line Publishing|website=www.valueline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to effectively target a customer, such as appeal to senses.

=== Television shows ===
In the ''[[Silicon Valley (TV series)|Silicon Valley]]'' episode "Homicide" (Season 2, Episode 6), Jared Dunn ([[Zach Woods]]) introduces the Pied Piper team to SWOT analysis. Later in that episode Dinesh ([[Kumail Nanjiani]]) and Gilfoyle ([[Martin Starr]]) employ the method when deciding whether or not to inform a stunt driver that the calculations for his upcoming jump were performed incorrectly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite website|url=https://www.hbo.com/silicon-valley/season-02/6-homicide/synopsis|website=HBO|title=Synopsis: ''Silicon Valley'' - 'Homicide'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3942">{{Insolvency}}
An '''undervalue transaction''' is a transaction entered into by a [[company (law)|company]]&lt;ref&gt;Some legal systems also apply undervalue transactions to insolvent individuals&lt;/ref&gt; who subsequently goes into [[bankruptcy]] which the court orders be set aside, usually upon the application of a [[liquidator (law)|liquidator]] for the benefit of the debtor's creditors.&lt;ref&gt;See for example, section 238 of the Insolvency Act 1986 in the [[United Kingdom]], and section 558FB of the [[Corporations Act 2001]] in [[Australia]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Under [[Australian insolvency law]] they are referred to as '''uncommercial transactions'''.

Under ordinary principles of [[contract law]], the courts will not generally look into the adequacy of the [[consideration]] provided by either side.  However, if a company is in real peril of going into bankruptcy, many legal systems provide a mechanism that transactions which are seriously commercially disadvantageous to the company can be unwound, so as to prevent prejudice to the creditors of the company.

Normally, for a transaction to be set aside as an undervalue transaction, the liquidator or equivalent must demonstrate that:
#the consideration received by the company in the transaction, in money or money's worth is significantly less than the value, in money or money's worth, provided by the company;
#the transaction was entered into during the "vulnerability period"; and
#at the time of the transaction, the company was unable to pay its debts as they fell due, or became unable to pay its debts as they fell due as a result of the transaction.&lt;ref&gt;This is the ''cash-flow'' test of insolvency.  Some jurisdictions (although not many) apply the ''balance-sheet'' test of insolvency to undervalue transactions, either as an alternative to the cash-flow test, or in addition to it.&lt;/ref&gt;

The vulnerability period is the period of time immediately prior to the company going into bankruptcy.  The length of the vulnerability period varies between countries, and some countries apply different vulnerability periods in different circumstances.  For example, in the United Kingdom, the vulnerability period is either:
#two years, if the person with whom the company entered into the transaction with is a "connected person",&lt;ref&gt;Connected person is usually defined under the relevant legislation, e.g. in the United Kingdom, see section 249 of the Insolvency Act, and which is drafted so as to try and catch all insiders and affiliates, other than employees&lt;/ref&gt; or
#6 months, in all other cases.
The period is calculated by reference to the period of time immediately preceding the company going into liquidation or administration.

The effect of a successful application to have a transaction declared as an undervalue transaction varies.  Inevitably the other party to the transaction who received the benefit has to return the benefit (or account for it) it to the liquidator.  In some countries the assets are treated in the normal way, and may be taken by any [[secured creditor]]s who have a [[security interest]] which catches the assets (characteristically, a [[floating charge]]).&lt;ref&gt;See ''Re Oasis Merchandising Services Ltd'' (1997) BCC 282, now superseded by legislation.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, some countries have "ring-fenced" recoveries of unfair preferences so that they are made available to the pool of assets for [[unsecured creditor]]s.

Many jurisdictions which have prohibitions on undervalue transactions also provide for an exception in the case of transactions entered into in the [[ordinary course of business]] where the [[Board of directors|directors]] are of a view that it is for the benefit of the company, and such transactions are usually either validated or presumed to be validated.

=== Narendra Modi Controversy ===

In 2013, the WIEF organizers invited the Gujarat chief minister [[Narendra Modi]] to deliver the keynote address via video-conferencing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://zeenews.india.com/news/nation/wharton-snub-support-grows-for-narendra-modi_832838.html | title = Wharton snub: Support grows for Narendra Modi | date = 2013-03-04 | accessdate = 2013-03-04 | publisher = Zee News }}&lt;/ref&gt; Toorjo Ghose, an assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania  and a small group of colleagues put together a petition after learning about Wharton's invitation to Modi. Kasturi Sen,  a Philadelphia-based attorney, created a group on Facebook and initially hosted the petition there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-03-05/news/37469804_1_responsible-student-body-organisers-wharton-india-economic-forum  Narendra Modi's address at Wharton nulled via Facebook, ET Bureau, Economic Times,  Mar 5, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;  The petition cited the [[India–United States relations#2005 Denial of Visa Application and Revocation of Visa|revocation of visa to Modi]] in 2005 by the US state department.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303380004579520041301275638 Why Narendra Modi Was Banned From the U.S., JAMES MANN Wall Street Journal,  May 2, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; They were joined by Ania Loomba and Suvir Kaul, both Indian-American [[University of Pennsylvania|UPenn]] professors, who were critical of Modi's handling of the [[2002 Gujarat violence|2002 Hindu-Muslim riots]], started formal a petition demanding the cancellation of the invitation, failing which they would protest his virtual presence at the event.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedp.com/article/2013/03/petition-against-narendra-modis-invitation-to-the-wharton-india-economic-forum  Petition against Narendra Modi's invitation to the Wharton India Economic Forum, By PETITIONERS, The Daily Pennsylvanian, 03/10/13]&lt;/ref&gt;

The petition was sent to  [[Amy Gutmann]], the UPenn president. The university leadership stepped in to diffuse what it saw as a potentially explosive situation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/newdelhi/inside-story-why-wharton-cancelled-modi-s-lecture/article1-1021161.aspx Inside story: why Wharton cancelled Modi's lecture, Charu Sudan Kasturi, Hindustan Times  New Delhi, March 05, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;
The WIEF organizers had to cancel the invitation, even though they stood by the earlier decision to invite Modi. They stated that they wanted to avoid putting Modi in a "compromising position".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-21651603 | title = India minister Narendra Modi's US speech cancelled | publisher = BBC | date = 2013-03-03 | accessdate = 2013-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the decision, the petition had been signed by around 135 people, and the number of signatories grew to 250 later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report_a-petition-signed-by-about-135-people-behind-wharton-s-decision-to-cancel-narendra-modi-invite_1807248 | title = A petition signed by about 135 people behind Wharton's decision to cancel Narendra Modi invite | newspaper = DNA | date = 2013-03-04 | accessdate = 2013-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A senior Wharton official distanced Wharton from the decision stating “Make no mistake, the move to not have Modi was a result of UPenn, not Wharton,”  pointing to the fact that not a single Wharton faculty member had signed the petition demanding cancellation of Modi's speech.

In Modi's support, the [[Shiv Sena]] leader [[Suresh Prabhakar Prabhu]] scrapped his visit to Wharton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.deccanherald.com/content/316390/sena-leader-prabhu-cancels-wharton.html | title = Sena leader Prabhu cancels Wharton visit after Modi snub |work= India Today |date= 2013-03-04 |accessdate= 2013-03-04 |publisher= Zee News }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another speaker, the Wall Street Journal writer and journalist [[Sadanand Dhume]], also pulled out from the forum in protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/columnist-sadanand-dhume-opts-out-of-wharton-forum-113030500661_1.html | title = Columnist Sadanand Dhume opts out of Wharton forum | newspaper = Business Standard | date = 2013-03-05 | accessdate = 2013-03-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was replaced by [[Padma Shri Awards (2010–2019)#2010|Sudhir Parikh]], a New Jersey-based eminent physician, philanthropist, publisher and [[Padma Shri]] awardee. However, Parikh too withdrew from the conference as a mark of protest.
