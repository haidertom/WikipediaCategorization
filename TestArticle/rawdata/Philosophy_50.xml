'''Agni Yoga''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: ''Агни Йога'') or the '''Living Ethics''' (Russian: ''Жива́я Этика''), or the '''Teaching of Life''' (Russian: ''Учение Жизни'') is a one of the [[Neo-Theosophy|neo-theosophical]] [[religious doctrine]] transmitted by the [[Helena Roerich]] and [[Nicholas Roerich]] from 1920. The term ''Agni Yoga'' means “Mergence with Divine Fire” or “Path to Mergence with Divine Fire”. This term was introduced by the Roerichs. The followers of Agni Yoga believe that the teaching was given to the Roerich family and their associates by [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom|Master]] [[Morya (Theosophy)|Morya]], the [[guru]] of Roerichs and [[Helena Blavatsky]], one of the founders of the modern theosophical movement and the [[Theosophical Society]]. 

Agni Yoga is a path of practice in daily life. It is the [[yoga]] of fiery energy, of consciousness, of responsible, directed thought. It teaches that the evolution of the [[planetary consciousness]] is a pressing necessity and that, through [[Individual#Buddhism|individual]] striving, it is an attainable aspiration for mankind. According to Helena Roerich, Agni Yoga is the [[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|synthesis]] of all [[yoga]]s. In all the [[List of Hindu texts|ancient Hindu scriptures]], the approaching Fiery Age was predicted. Agni-Fire, which to a varying degree is at the heart of all the yogas, will extremely sate the atmosphere of our planet, and all the branches of Yoga will be merged into a fiery synthesis. Agni Yoga is a fire [[baptism]].

The most significant features of Agni Yoga are cosmism and [[universalism]]. They are expressed in the interpretation of any phenomena of human existence from the point of view of their cosmic significance and interrelation with the being of the [[Universe]].

Agni Yoga played a significant role in bringing knowledge of [[Asian religions]] to [[Western world]]. Living Ethics has an international following and  has thousands of adherents. The ideas of Teaching of Life have exerted an influence on another [[esoteric]] movements and philosophies, among them the [[New Age]] and [[Transhumanism]].

==Birth of the new religion==

===Etymology and concept===
The term ''Agni Yoga'' means “Mergence with Divine Fire” or “Path to Mergence with Divine Fire”. This term was introduced to the western public by the [[Nicholas Roerich]] and [[Helena Roerich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highest-yoga.info/en/yoga/agni-yoga.html |title=Agni Yoga |publisher=highest-yoga.info |accessdate=21 November 2018 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/746J1WitJ |archivedate=21 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Agni]]'' ({{lang-sa|अग्नि}}) is the [[Vedas|Vedic]] and Living Ethics ''God of Fire'', one marks immortality and the symbol of life. Agni is one of the supreme gods in the [[Rigveda]]. In Agni Yoga it is the Creative Fire of the Universe, the root of  the "Fire of Space"; and "psychic energy", the powers of the human mind and heart, particularly those manifesting in love, thought, and creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/world-religions/oclc/659908115?ht=edition&amp;referer=null |author=[[John Bowker (theologian)|Bowker, John]] |title=World Religions |publisher=New York: DK Publishing, Inc. |accessdate=10 September 2018 |year=1997 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6wJMDtNzh?url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/world-religions/oclc/659908115?ht=edition&amp;referer=null |archivedate=8 January 2018 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origin myth found in many [[Indo-European culture]]s Agni is a bird like being, that brings fire from the gods to mankind. Alternatively, this messenger brings an elixir of immortality from heaven to [[Earth]]. In the early [[Vedic literature]], Agni primarily connotes the fire as a god, one reflecting the primordial powers to consume, transform and convey.&lt;ref name="Macdonell1898p15"&gt;{{cite book |author=Arthur Anthony Macdonell |title=Vedic Mythology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b7Meabtj8mcC |year=1898 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-1113-3 |pages=15–16, 92–93 |accessdate=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Yoga]]'' ({{lang-sa|योग}}; {{pronunciation|Yoga pronunciation.ogg |help=no}}) is one of the six orthodox schools of [[Hindu philosophy]]. There is a broad variety of yoga schools, practices, and goals in [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Jainism]]. Yoga is a group of [[soul|spiritual]], [[mind|mental]], and [[Human body|physical]] practices or disciplines which originated in [[ancient India]]. The term ''Yoga'' has been applied to a variety of practices and methods. In Hinduism these include [[Jnana yoga|Jnana Yoga]], [[Bhakti yoga|Bhakti Yoga]], [[Karma yoga|Karma Yoga]], [[Laya yoga|Laya Yoga]] and [[Hatha yoga|Hatha Yoga]]. The term ''[[Rāja yoga]]'' originally referred to the ultimate goal of yoga, which is [[Samadhi]] ([[Sanskrit]]: {{lang|sa|समाधि}}, {{IPA-hns|səˈmaːdʱi|hi}}), but was popularised by [[Swami Vivekananda]] as the common name for ''Ashtanga Yoga''. In the Ashtanga Yoga tradition, ''Samadhi'' is the eighth and final limb identified in the [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]].&lt;ref name="Feuerstein2012"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Georg Feuerstein]] |title=The Yoga Tradition: Its History, Literature, Philosophy and Practice |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cI5XDwAAQBAJ |date=23 October 2012 |publisher=Hohm Press |isbn=978-1-935387-39-8 |page=37 |accessdate=10 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=yogadarsanabook3&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/yogadaranasutra00patagoog#page/n112/mode/2up |title=The Yoga-darsana: The sutras of Patanjali with the Bhasya of Vyasa - Book 3  GN Jha (Translator) |publisher=Harvard University Archives |pages=94-96 |accessdate=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Aum]]'' or ''Oṃ'' ([[Devanagari]]: {{script|Deva|'''ॐ'''}}), {{audio|Om pro.ogg|listen}}, is a sacred sound and a spiritual symbol in [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Jainism]]. This word has three [[phoneme]]s: ''a'', ''u'', and ''m'', though it is often described as [[trisyllabic]] despite this being either archaic or the result of translation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite-book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e89eDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT287&amp;dq=%22om%22+%22three%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjWvpr3_8zcAhVDd6wKHehnCgIQ6AEIQzAF#v=onepage&amp;q=%22om%22%20%22three%22&amp;f=false |title=The Om Mala: Meanings of the Mystic Sound |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |isbn=9789387471856 |accessdate=13 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite-book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dLlIAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=%22om%22+%22three%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjWvpr3_8zcAhVDd6wKHehnCgIQ6AEITzAH#v=onepage&amp;q=%22om%22%20%22three%22&amp;f=false |author=Vālmīki |year=1891 |title=The Yoga-vásishtha-mahárámáyana of Válmiki |volume=1 |page=61 |publisher=Bonnerjee and Company |accessdate=26 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; That signifies the essence of the ultimate reality, consciousness or [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite-book |url=https://www.amazon.com/Illustrated-Encyclopedia-Hinduism-Vol-N-Z/dp/0823931803/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1538043614&amp;sr=1-1 |author=James G Lochtefeld |title=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism |year=2002| volume=2 N-Z |page=482 |publisher=Rosen Publishing |isbn=978-0823931804 |accessdate=27 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The twelfth book of the [[Scriptures]] of Agni Yoga is called ''AUM''. Aum, as this book says, was a synthesis of sonant strivings. Prayer and inward concentration are excellent attainments which render healthful the state of the spirit. Each one in his own way has contributed a manifestation useful to spiritual concentration, whether he sought the solution in music, in song, or in the dance; man was striving to create a particularly exalted state of mind, promoting the reception of the higher energies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://agniyoga.org/ay_en/Aum.php |title=Aum, §4 |publisher=agniyoga.org |year=1936 |accessdate=14 October 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/73ASzqsWl?url=http://agniyoga.org/ay_en/Aum.php |archivedate=14 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ur'' or ''[[Aditi]]'' ([[Sanskrit]]: अदिति "limitless"),&lt;ref&gt;From ''a-'' ([[privative a]]) and ''diti'' "bound," which is from the Proto Indo-European root *''da-'' "to bind."&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Vedas]] and Living Ethics is the Mother of the gods and all twelve zodiacal spirits from whose cosmic matrix the heavenly bodies were born. As celestial mother of every existing form and being, the synthesis of all things, she is associated with space and with mystic speech. She is mentioned nearly 80 times in the [[Rigveda]]: the verse "[[Daksha]] sprang from Aditi and Aditi from Daksha" is seen by Theosophists as a reference to "the eternal cyclic re-birth of the same divine Essence" and divine wisdom.&lt;ref name=theosociety&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/etgloss/adi-ag.htm |title=Adi-Ag: Encyclopedic Theosophical Glossary |publisher=Theosociety.org |accessdate=4 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/73fwLSZQ7?url=https://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/etgloss/adi-ag.htm |archivedate=4 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Ur is the root of the Light of Fire", it is stated in the [[holy writ]] of Agni Yoga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://agniyoga.org/ay_en/Fiery-World-I.php |title=Fiery World Part I Preface |publisher=agniyoga.org |accessdate=14 October 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/73ATDKnlB?url=http://agniyoga.org/ay_en/Fiery-World-I.php |archivedate=14 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Shambhala]]'' ({{lang-sa|शम्भलः}}, {{bo|t=བདེ་འབྱུང}};) is a birthplace of [[Kalki]], the final incarnation of [[Vishnu]], who will usher in a New Age — [[Satya Yuga]].

''[[Karma]]'' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɑr|m|ə}}; {{lang-sa|कर्म|karma}}, {{IPA-sa|ˈkərmə|IPA|Karma.ogg}}) means action, work or deed. It also refers to the spiritual principle of cause and effect where intent and actions of an individual influence his future. Good intent and good deeds contribute to good karma and future happiness, while bad intent and bad deeds contribute to bad karma and future suffering. With origins in [[History of India|ancient India]]'s [[Vedic civilization]], the philosophy of karma is closely associated with the idea of [[Reincarnation|rebirth]] in many schools of [[Indian religions]], particularly [[Karma in Hinduism|Hinduism]], [[Karma in Buddhism|Buddhism]], [[Karma in Jainism|Jainism]] and [[Sikhism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Parvesh Singla |title=The Manual of Life – Karma |year=2002 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1mXR35jX-TsC&amp;pg=PP5 |publisher=books.google.com |pages=5–7 |accessdate=17 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Karma works as one of the great principles of Cosmic Action. ''When man realizes the power of karma and strives to express the best aspirations, his path is parallel with the universal energy. The universal energy attracts the creative strivings. The future and the Infinite are thus being built'', written in the Holy Scripture of Agni Yoga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://agniyoga.org/ay_en/Infinity-II.php |title=Infinity Part II, 159 |publisher=agniyoga.org |year=1930 |accessdate=21 October 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/73L93b1d9?url=http://agniyoga.org/ay_en/Infinity-II.php |archivedate=21 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Spiritual evolution]]'' is the [[philosophy|philosophical]], [[theology|theological]], [[Esoteric knowledge|esoteric]] or [[Spirituality|spiritual]] idea that nature and human beings and [[human culture]] evolve: either extending from an established [[esoteric cosmology|cosmological]] [[pattern]] (ascent), or in accordance with certain pre-established potentials.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube |GbWMw249xY8 |The Hidden History of Humanity}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase "spiritual evolution" can occur in the context of ''higher evolution'', a term used to differentiate psychological, mental, or spiritual evolution from the ''lower evolution'' or [[biological evolution]] of physical form.&lt;ref&gt;

====Theosophy====
{{Main|Theosophy (Blavatskian)}}

The [[Theosophical Society]] was officially formed in [[New York City]] on 17 November 1875 by [[Helena Blavatsky]], [[Henry Steel Olcott]], [[William Quan Judge]], and others. It was self-described as "an unsectarian body of seekers after Truth, who endeavour to promote Brotherhood and strive to serve humanity." After a few years Olcott and Blavatsky moved to India and established the International Headquarters at [[Theosophical Society Adyar|Adyar]], in [[Chennai|Madras]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.de/books/about/The_Theosophical_Movement.html?id=OC4IAQAAIAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y |year=1951 |title=The Theosophical Movement 1875–1950 |publisher=Cunningham Press |location=Los Angeles |accessdate=26 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Madame Blavatsky (''Upasica'' - this spiritual name means a female lay disciple. So the ''Teachers'' called [[Helena Petrovna Blavatsky|HPB]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Theosophy and culture: Nicholas Roerich |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=AdpG8sGt8K8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=ru&amp;source=gbs_atb#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |author=Stasulane, Anita |publisher=Gregorian Biblical BookShop |location=Rome |volume=8 |year=2005 |page=26-27 |isbn=978-88-7839-035-5 |accessdate=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;), the greatest [[occultist]] in the history of [[Western civilization]], insisted that [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] is not a [[religion]], although did refer to it as the modern transmission of the "once universal religion" that she claimed had existed deep into the human past. The motto of the Theosophical movement: '''There is no Religion higher than Truth'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.ultindia.org/tm_magazine/TMOct2018.pdf |title=The motto is located at the top of the magazine page |journal=The Theosophical Movement.

Theosophical organisations, regard it as a system that embraces what they see as the "essential truth" underlying religion, philosophy, and science. Theosophical groups allow their members to hold other religious allegiances, resulting in [[Theosophists]] who also identify as [[Christians]], [[Buddhists]], or [[Hindus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.ru/books/about/Is_Theosophy_a_Religion.html?id=2Kd5ngEACAAJ&amp;source=kp_cover&amp;redir_esc=y |last=Blavatsky |first=Helena |year=2013 |title=Is Theosophy a Religion? |pages=24 |isbn=9781258977719 |accessdate=10 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term [[Neo-Theosophy]] was coined by Ferdinand T. Brooks around 1912. This term used by the followers of Helena Blavatsky to denominate the system of theosophical ideas expounded following the death of Blavatsky in 1891. This material differed in major respects from Blavatsky's original presentation, but it is accepted as genuinely theosophical by many theosophists around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.blavatskyarchives.com/thomas/ |title=Theosophy Versus Neo-Theosophy: Margaret Thomas' Study of C.

Other neo-theosophists include [[Rudolf Steiner]]'s contemporary [[Peter Deunov]] and [[Samael Aun Weor]]. [[Dion Fortune]] and [[Aleister Crowley]] were also influencers of the leading edge of the theosophical movement. Some examples of neo-theosophists today include [[Benjamin Creme]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=http://share-international.org/books/PDFs/BCreme_TransmissionAMeditationForTheNewAge_Jun06.pdf |author=[[Benjamin Creme]] |title=Transmission A meditation for the New Age |publisher=share-international.org |accessdate=5 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/73hqv2NN3?url=http://share-international.org/books/PDFs/BCreme_TransmissionAMeditationForTheNewAge_Jun06.pdf |archivedate=5 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Victor Skumin]]. So, in 1990, Skumin, based on the theosophical concept of [[spiritual evolution]], proposed a classification of '''Homo spiritalis''' ([[Latin]]: ''Spiritual man''), the sixth root race, consisting of eight sub-races (subspecies): ''HS-0'' Anabiosis spiritalis, ''HS-1'' Scientella spiritalis, ''HS-2'' Aurora spiritalis, ''HS-3'' Ascensus spiritalis, ''HS-4'' Vocatus spiritalis, ''HS-5'' Illuminatio spiritalis, ''НS-6'' Creatio spiritalis, and ''HS-7'' Servitus spiritalis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Skumin |first=V.

Russian [[philosophy]] as a separate entity started its development in the [[History of Russia (1892–1917)|19th century]], defined initially by the opposition of [[Westernizers]], advocating Russia's following the Western political and economical models, and [[Slavophiles]], insisting on developing [[Russia]] as a unique civilization. The latter group included [[Nikolai Danilevsky]] and [[Konstantin Leontiev]], the early founders of [[eurasianism]]. ''Slavophilia'' was an intellectual movement originating from 19th century that wanted the [[Russian Empire]] to be developed upon values and institutions derived from its early history. There were also similar movements in [[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Poland]], and [[Serbia]]. Depending on the historical context, its opposite could be termed [[Slavophobia]], a fear of [[Slavic culture]].&lt;ref name=Brit&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9068172/Slavophile |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |title=Slavophile  Russian history |accessdate=6 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/73jPhqyh2?url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Slavophile |archivedate=6 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discussion of Russia's place in the world has since become the most characteristic feature of Russian philosophy. Notable  philosophers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries include [[Vladimir Solovyov (philosopher)|Vladimir Solovyev]], [[Vasily Rozanov]], [[Lev Shestov]], [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Sergei Bulgakov]], [[Pavel Florensky]], [[Pitirim Sorokin]].In its further development, Russian philosophy was also marked by deep connection to [[literature]] and interest in [[creativity]], [[society]], [[religion]], and [[Russian cosmism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite-book |url=https://www.amazon.com/Red-Cosmos-Tsiolkovskii-Grandfather-Centennial/dp/1603441174 |author=James T.

Vladimir Solovyov described his encounters with the entity ''Sophia'' in his works, such as ''Three Encounters'' and ''Lectures on Godmanhood''. His fusion was driven by the desire to reconcile or unite with Orthodox Christianity the various traditions by the Russian [[Slavophiles]]' concept of [[sobornost]]. His Russian religious philosophy had a very strong impact on the [[Russian Symbolism|Russian Symbolist]] art movements of his time. His teachings on ''Sophia'', conceived as the merciful unifying feminine wisdom of God comparable to the Hebrew [[Shekinah]] or various goddess traditions, have been deemed a [[heresy]] by [[Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia]] and as unsound and unorthodox by the [[Patriarchate of Moscow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ecumenizm.tripod.com/ECUMENIZM/id17.html |title=The Sophian heresy and attempts to feminize God |publisher=ecumenizm.tripod.com |accessdate=6 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/73jQWHmoo?url=http://ecumenizm.tripod.com/ECUMENIZM/id17.html |archivedate=6 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nikolai Fyodorovich Fyodorov|Nikolai Fyodorov]] was a [[Russian Orthodox Christian]] philosopher, who was part of the Russian cosmism movement and a precursor of [[transhumanism]]. Fedorov argued that humanity is the culmination of [[evolution]], as well as its creator and director. Humans must therefore direct evolution where their reason and morality dictate. Fedorov stated that the struggle against death can become the most natural cause uniting all people, regardless of their nationality, race, citizenship or wealth. He called this the ''Common Cause''. Fedorov thought that death and afterdeath existence should become the subject of comprehensive scientific inquiry, that achieving [[immortality]] and revival is the greatest goal of science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.berdyaev.com/berdiaev/berd_lib/1915_186.html |author=[[Nikolai Berdyaev]] |title=The religion of resuscitative resurrection The "Philosophy of the Common Task" of N.

At the beginning of the 20th century, there was a burst of scientific investigation into interplanetary travel, largely driven by the fiction writers such as [[Jules Verne]] and [[Herbert Wells]] as well as philosophical movements like [[Russian cosmism]]. In 1903, [[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]] published the first serious scientific work on space travel. His work was essentially unknown outside the [[Russian Empire]], but inside the country it inspired further research, experimentation and the formation of the Society for Studies of [[Interplanetary spaceflight]].&lt;ref name="Riper2007"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k8CxJeFzCdQC&amp;pg=PA26 |author=A.

He believed humans would eventually colonize the [[Milky Way]]. His thought preceded the Space Age by several decades, and some of what he foresaw in his imagination has come into being since his death. Tsiolkovsky did not believe in traditional religious cosmology, but instead he believed in a cosmic being that governed humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.prlib.ru/en/node/404538 |last=[[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky|Tsiolkovsky]] |first=Konstantin Eduardovich |title=The Will of the Universe; Unknown Intelligent Forces |place=[[Kaluga]] |publisher=The author's edition |year=1928 |pages=23 |language=Russian |accessdate=6 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/73jR4GDrr?url=https://www.prlib.ru/en/node/404538 |archivedate=6 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ideas of the Russian philosophers and cossmists later were developed by those in the transhumanist movement and [[Rerikhism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year=2013 |url=http://sovieteramuseum.com/?product=art-works-by-russian-cosmism-painter-xx-xxi-ct-catalogue-of-exhibition-2013 |title=Art works by Russian cosmism painter XX – XXI ct.

Information about [[Vedanta]] and [[Buddhism]] spread in [[Western countries]] in the first decade of the 20th century. In the United States of the 1920s, when the voises in religion were arguing over [[fundamentalism]] and [[modernism]] as the only available choice, and long before [[Shangri-La]] had become a popularly accepted myth, a vanguard movement was promoting the alternative of the wisdom of the [[Eastern world]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brian Taves |year=1985 |title=Philosophy Into Popular Fiction: Talbot Mundy and The Theosophical Society |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/41171147?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents |journal=Southern California QuarterlyTo |volume=67 |issue=2 |pages=153-186 |doi=10.2307/41171147 |issn= |accessdate=11 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/73qsRpCDp?url=http://scq.ucpress.edu/content/67/2/153 |archivedate=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] proposed the existence of a society of Secret Chiefs called the [[Great White Brotherhood]]. The members of this Brotherhood, in belief systems akin to Theosophy and [[New Age]], are said to be perfected beings of great power who spread spiritual teachings through selected humans. The members of the Brotherhood may be known as the [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]] or the [[Ascended Masters]]. They are referred to by [[theosophist]]s as Elder Brothers of the human race, [[Adept]]s, [[Mahātmā]]s, or simply as the Masters. The first person to talk about them in the West was [[Helena Blavatsky]], after she and other people claimed to have received messages from them. These included [[Nicholas Roerich]] and [[Helena Roerich]], too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.ru/books?id=TI6fAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+myth+of+the+Masters+revived&amp;hl=ru&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiY0bbboKTeAhWOhqYKHY0ABHMQ6AEIKzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20myth%20of%20the%20Masters%20revived&amp;f=false |title=The myth of the Masters revived: The Occult Lives of Nikolai and Elena Roerich |publisher=books.google.ru |isbn=978-90-04-27043-5 |accessdate=26 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She emphasized that knowledge was the leading path of all great Teachers.

When Nicholas Roerich passed away, his wife is believed to have carried on the work prescribed by Master Morya, “I exist only due to the ray of the Great Master, who said it was necessary for me to remain because no one could replace me as I worked under the highest Cosmic Sign, and this century was in need of my attainment”. The main aim of Helena Roerich was to spread the message of Agni Yoga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rbth.com/blogs/tatar_straits/2017/03/18/when-helena-roerich-called-kalimpong-home_721753 |title=When Helena Roerich called Kalimpong home |author=Ajay Kamalakaran |publisher=Russia beyond |date=18 March 2017 |accessdate=11 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/73qtOgEyJ?url=https://www.rbth.com/blogs/tatar_straits/2017/03/18/when-helena-roerich-called-kalimpong-home_721753 |archivedate=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Agni Yoga Society in the State of New York===
The Agni Yoga Society was founded in 1920 by Helena and Nicholas Roerich. It is a non-profit educational institution incor|porated in 1946 under the laws of the [[State of New York]], and is supported entirely by voluntary contributions and membership dues. The organization was located in the building ''[[Master Apartments]]''. The aims of the Society are embodied in the philosophy that gives it its name—Agni Yoga—as contained in the books of the Agni Yoga Series published by the Society. In them is found a synthesis of ancient Eastern beliefs and modern Western thought and a bridge between the spiritual and the scientific.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.agniyoga.us/ |title=AGNI YOGA (Sacred Heart Fire) AGNI YOGA The Great Synthesis |publisher=agniyoga.us |accessdate=11 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/73qtsQePo?url=http://www.agniyoga.us/ |archivedate=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Unlike previous [[yoga]]s, Agni Yoga is a path of practice in daily life. It is the yoga of fiery energy, of consciousness, of responsible, directed thought. It teaches that the evolution of the planetary consciousness is a pressing necessity and that, through individual striving, it is an attainable aspiration for mankind. Though not systematized in an ordinary sense, it is a teaching that helps the student to discover moral and spiritual guide-posts by which to learn to govern his or her life and thus contribute to the [[common good]]. For this reason Agni Yoga has been called a ''Living ethic''. 
Speaking about the role of [[personality]] in the [[spiritual evolution]] of mankind, [[Helena Roerich]] wrote,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.aquaac.org/un/elttrs/201003.html |title=The Spiritual Work of the United Nations and the Liberation of Humanity Creating Fundamental Global Transformations through the Power of Thought |publisher=aquaac.org |accessdate=11 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/73qu54znq?url=http://www.aquaac.org/un/elttrs/201003.html  |archivedate=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.agniyoga.org/ay_en/Letters-of-Helena-Roerich-II.php |title=Letters of Helena Roerich II, 25 October 1936 |publisher=agniyoga.org |accessdate=25 October 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6p2OJSzbs?url=http://www.agniyoga.org/ay_en/Letters-of-Helena-Roerich-II.php |archivedate=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The greatest benefit that we can contribute consists in the broadening of consciousness, and the improvement and enrichment of our thinking, together with the purification of the heart, in order to strengthen our emanations; and by thus raising our vibrations, we restore the health of all that surrounds us.
True, it is impossible to increase our store of psychic energy without the help of the Teacher; however if our hearts are open and purified, and if our organism permits it, the Teacher will not tarry in manifesting himself''.}}

===Latvian Roerich Society in Riga===
The [[Latvia]]n Roerich Society is one of the oldest society established by the Roerichs family. In 1920 Vladimir Schibayev, while being in [[London]], met  Nicholas and Helena Roerichs. In [[Riga]] they created a group of people to study Agni Yoga and another theosophical literature. In 1928, Schibayev went to [[India]], to become the secretary of Roerich.&lt;ref name="la"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latvijasrerihabiedriba.lv/images/RXLVang.htm |title=In short about Latvian Roerich Society |publisher=latvijasrerihabiedriba |accessdate=11 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/73quP4eRE?url=http://www.latvijasrerihabiedriba.lv/images/RXLVang.htm |archivedate=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Riga the place of the leader of Latvian Roerich Society was taken by [[Doctor (title)|doctor]]-[[Homeopathy|homeopath]] [[:lv:Fēlikss Lūkins|Felix Lukin.]] [[Dr.]] Felix Lukin and his son Dr. [[:lv:Haralds Lūkins|Harald Lukin]] conducted [[clinical trials]] are many natural [[medication]]s that they received from [[Svetoslav Roerich]] of the Himalayan Research Institute named ''Urusvati''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xB-0B1OWsbIC&amp;pg=PA144&amp;lpg=PA144&amp;dq=Feliks+Lukin&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9sr1G3-LjI&amp;sig=BOFxH1ypWEF0Mff4E_p4yCgnFWc&amp;hl=ru&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwikrLTm8JbeAhUFposKHVn1DlA4ChDoATAFegQIBBAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Feliks%20Lukin&amp;f=false |title=History and status of homoeopathy around the world |author=Aswarda Das |publisher=books.google.com |isbn=81-8056-573-4 |year=2005 |pages=144-147 |accessdate=21 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936 [[:lv:Rihards Rudzītis|Rihard Rudzitis]] officially became the president of the Latvian Society. During his lead, the books of Living Ethics, the works by the Roerichs, [[Helena Blavatsky]]’s and works by Rudzitis himself were published. In 1937 the first conference of [[Baltic states|Baltic]] Roerich Societies took place. The Latvian Society was renewed at the [[Soviet Union]] in 1988. Dr. Harald Lukin carried the Roerichs [[Banner of Peace]]. The new president Gunta Rudzite, the daughter of Rihard Rudzitis, held contacts with many people of the republics in the [[USSR]] who were interested in the ideas of Agni Yoga. On 2005 the Roerich Society received a social beneficial status in the [[Republic of Latvia]].&lt;ref name="la"/&gt;

===Master Institute of United Arts in New York City===
Nicolas Roerich is known as a thinker and a builder of life. His art and writings are an evocation to Beauty, to Knowledge, and to Culture. His vision is nicely captured in his philosophical statement of the Master Institute of United Arts which he formed in [[New York City]] in 1921:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://blog.philosophicalsociety.org/2017/07/12/nicholas-roerichs-symbolic-journey/ |title=Inspired By Art: Nicholas Roerich’s Symbolic Journey |publisher=philosophicalsociety.org |accessdate=11 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/73qumopSR?url=https://blog.philosophicalsociety.org/2017/07/12/nicholas-roerichs-symbolic-journey/ |archivedate=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|''Art will unify all humanity. Art is one – indivisible. Art has its many branches, yet all are one.  Art is the manifestation of the coming synthesis. Art is for all''.}}

Mr. and Mrs. Horch financed and directed the Master Institute that taught the fine and dramatic arts. For much of its existence, the Master Institute was housed in the [[Master Apartments]], designed by Harvery Wiley Corbett in 1929 for Roerich and built on the site of the former Horch mansion at 310 Riverside Dr. in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/archival/collections/ldpd_6636038/ |title=Louis L. and Nettie S.

Roerich planned to realize the educational concepts at the Institute. He invited as teachers such famous people as [[George Bellows]], [[Claude Fayette Bragdon]], [[Norman Bel Geddes]], [[Stark Young]], [[Deems Taylor]], [[Robert Edmond Jones]], and [[Lee Simonson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roerich.org/roerich-biography.php |title=Nicholas Roerich Biography America |publisher=Nicholas Roerich Museum New York |accessdate=11 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/73qvhsopy?url=http://www.roerich.org/roerich-biography.php |archivedate=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intensive work was in process under direct supervision of Roerich. Nicholas gave lectures, organized new classes, for example classes of music and sculpture for the blind. Many representatives of American science and culture expressed their willingness to educate students according with the proposed curriculum. There were [[Felix Salmond]], [[Ernest Bloch]], and [[Michael Fokin]]. In the ''Institute of United Arts in New York City'' also taught [[Rockwell Kent]], [[Claude Bragdon]], [[George Bellows]], and [[Norman Bel Geddes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roerich-izvara.ru/eng/museum/roerich-and-america-13.htm

Some contemporaries were skeptical spiritual mission of Nicholas Roerich. But those who embraced his philosophy experienced something transformative in his canvases. Roerich's name is universally known not only as Master of the brush but also as a thinker and a builder of life. The works of the Artist are an evocation to Beauty, to Knowledge, and to Culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://blog.philosophicalsociety.org/tag/master-institute-of-united-arts/ |title=Tag Archives: Master Institute of United Arts |publisher=The Masonic Philosophical Society |accessdate=11 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/73qwQmTGL?url=https://blog.philosophicalsociety.org/tag/master-institute-of-united-arts/ |archivedate=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roerich's family moved to [[India]] in December 1923. They settled in [[Darjeeling]], a town in the [[India]]n [[States and union territories of India|state]] of [[West Bengal]]. It is located in the [[Lower Himalayan Range]]s at an elevation of {{convert|6700|ft|1|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ignca.gov.in/roerich-himalayan-museum-of-folk-and-tribal-art/ |title=Roerich Himalayan Museum Of Folk And Tribal Art |publisher=ignca.gov.in |accessdate=11 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/73qx6ANWT?url=http://ignca.gov.in/roerich-himalayan-museum-of-folk-and-tribal-art/ |archivedate=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1925 to 1928, Roerichs took part in a [[Central Asia]] expedition, that traveled through hard-to-reach and little-investigated regions of [[India]], [[China]], [[Soviet Union]], [[Mongolia]] and [[Tibet]]. [[Sikkim]] was the starting point of the expedition. During the expedition, research in topics such as [[history]], [[archeology]], [[ethnography]], [[history of philosophy]], [[arts]] and [[religions]], and [[geography]] was conducted. Rare manuscripts were found, and rich linguistic materials were collected. Special attention was paid to the problem of historical unity of cultures of various peoples. In 1925, Helena Roerich began to translate an extensive selection from ''[[The Mahatma Letters to A.P. Sinnett]]''. She also wrote a book named "Chalice of the East", which was published under the pen name "Iskander Khanum". Helena Roerich's manuscript "Foundations of Buddhism" was published in 1926, at [[Ulaanbaatar|Urga]], where her expedition was staying at the time. In this book, the fundamental philosophical notions of Buddha's Teaching were interpreted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.found-helenaroerich.ru/eng/biography/ |title=Helena I.

===Nicholas Roerich Museum in New York City===
[[File:WTM3 The Fixers 0015.jpg |180px |thumb |right |[[Nicholas Roerich Museum, New York City]]]]
{{Main|Nicholas Roerich Museum, New York City}}

The Nicholas Roerich Museum in New York City was originally located in the Master Apartments at 103rd Street and [[Riverside Drive (Manhattan)]], which were built especially for Roerich in 1929. Now the museum is located in a brownstone at 319 West 107th Street on Manhattan's Upper West Side. This Museum is one of the most off-the-beaten-path of Manhattan's museums, a collection of works by Nicolas Roerich, who lived on the Upper West Side for a time in the 1920's. The brownstone is chock-full of amazing natural scenes from the Himalayas, where this artist spent  two decades of his life. Roerich usually painted in stark tempera, with blazing orange skies or impossibly deep blue mountains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/16/travel/journeys-specialty-museums-finding-art-not-crowds-in-new-york.html |date=16 April 2006 |author=Seth Kugel |title=JOURNEYS: SPECIALTY MUSEUMS; Finding Art, Not Crowds, in New York.

Currently, the museum includes between 100 and 200 of Roerich's works as well as a collection of archival materials and still attracts pilgrims from throughout the world. The mission of the Nicholas Roerich Museum is one: to make available to the public the full range of Roerich’s accomplishments. They cover the realms of art, science, spirituality, peacemaking, and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I5Kyo03NxncC&amp;pg=PA86&amp;dq=%22Nicholas+Roerich+Museum%22&amp;ei=CfWySJWGBIyuyAT-uKz-Bg&amp;sig=ACfU3U1VaGGP0xsNuixcSHcUcdMEJCcA3g |title=Spiritual Places| last=Squires| first=Emily| authorlink=Emily Squires |author2=Len Belzer |year=2000| pages=86 |publisher=Cosimo, Inc. |isbn=1931044031 |accessdate=17 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Museum seeks to realize the ideas of Agni Yoga on the role of culture in the evolution of the world and evolution of the human consciousness. Information about these Roerich's ideas is always available. The museum also provides an opportunity for young musicians to perform in front of an audience on a voluntary and free basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roerich.org/museum-about.php?mid=about_en |title=Nicholas Roerich Museum New York |publisher=roerich.org |accessdate=14 October 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6j1nfmzWO?url=http://www.roerich.org/museum-about.php |archivedate=15 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The core of the Rerikhism is the philosophy of cosmic reality – the Agni Yoga, which develops the idea of a close relationship between man and [[Cosmos]], contains knowledge which assists in understanding the specific features peculiar to the new evolutionary stage of mankind's development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.icr.su/museum/ |title=The Nicholas Roerich Museum |accessdate=17 September 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6pms1o0eG?url=http://en.icr.su/museum/ |publisher=en.icr.su |archivedate=17 April 2017 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The World Organisation of Culture of Health===

''The World Organisation of Culture of Health ('''WOCH''')'' — International [[Social movement organization|social movement]] ''To Health via Culture'' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Междунаро́дное обще́ственное Движе́ние «К Здоро́вью че́рез Культу́ру») was founded in the year 1994. [[Victor Skumin]] was elected to the post of the President-founder of this organisation. The WOCH operates in accordance with the registered in [[Ministry of Justice (Russia)|Ministry of Justice of the Russian Federation]] Charter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kult-zdor.ru/?page_id=824 |title=Charter of the World Organisation of Culture of Health (Russian: Устав) |publisher=Kult-zdor.ru |accessdate=18 September 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6poMifaLN?url=http://kult-zdor.ru/?page_id=824 |archivedate=18 April 2017 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Agni Yoga much attention is paid to health. So in the book ''Supermundane'' (paragraph 525) recorded the words of [[Morya (Theosophy)|Master Morya]], addressed to Urusvati,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://agniyoga.org/ay_en/Supermundane.php |title=Supermundane, 525 |publisher=agniyoga.org |accessdate=14 October 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/73ATQDcyS?url=http://agniyoga.org/ay_en/Supermundane.php |archivedate=14 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|''Urusvati knows that people are responsible for three aspects of health. First, their own health; second, the health of the planet; and finally, the health of the Supermundane World... People must safeguard their own health, not only for themselves but also for those around them. The human organism, though seemingly small, is a powerful repository of energy, and truly dominates its earthly environment''.}}

It is from these positions that WOCH approaches the solution of problems related to health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://kult-zdor.ru/?page_id=5 |author=Victor A.

The intellect of a physician must be reinforced by his heart. The physician must be a psychologist, and he must not ignore the wondrous psychic energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://agniyoga.org/ay_en/Aum.php |title=Aum, §3 |publisher=agniyoga.org |year=1936 |accessdate=14 October 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/73ASzqsWl |archivedate=14 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prof. Verhorubova and Prof. Lobanova from [[Tomsk State Pedagogical University]] argued (2012) that in accordance with the concept of a culture of health, proposed by [[Victor Skumin|Skumin]], the culture  – spiritual, mental, and physical – determines the status of human health. And health – spiritual, mental, physical – is a prerequisite for achieving a higher level of culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://cyberleninka.ru/article/n/mnogoobrazie-opredeleniy-fenomena-kultura-zdorovya-kak-pokazatel-ego-mnogogrannosti-v-pedagogicheskom-obrazovanii |last2=Lobanova |first2=N.A. |last1= Verhorubova |first1=O.V. |title= Многообразие определений феномена "культура здоровья" как показатель его многогранности в педагогическом образовании |trans-title=The diversity of definitions the phenomenon of "culture of health" as an indicator of its versatility in education |journal=Вестник Томского государственного педагогического университета |year=2012 |issue=5 |pages=161–5 |accessdate=10 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6cKKxNxWb |archivedate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Organisation of Culture of Health, in order to promote international relations, has established a link with the International Buddhist Meditation Centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/ibmcnepal/videos/vb.242290825944809/670365706470650/?type=2&amp;theater] |title=International Buddhist Meditation Centre |publisher=facebook.com |accessdate=20 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[anthem]] of WOCH (''To Health via Culture'') consists of four [[stanzas]]. The capital letters each of the four stanzas form the word [[Agni]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Skumin |first=Victor |script-title=ru: Молитвы, гимны, притчи Культуры Здоровья |trans-title=Culture of Health: prayers, hymns, parables |year=2002 |location=[[Cheboksary]] |publisher=To Health via Culture |url=http://biblmdkz.ru/m.html |language=Russian |isbn=5-88167-018-3 |accessdate=18 September 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6vmcES03C?url=http://biblmdkz.ru/m.html |archivedate=17 December 2017 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gimns of Culture of Health"&gt;{{cite book |last=Skumin |first=Victor |script-title=ru: Гимны Культуры Здоровья |trans-title=Gimns of Culture of Health |year=2007 |location=[[Cheboksary]] |publisher=To Health via Culture |url=http://biblmdkz.ru/gimn.html |language=Russian |isbn=978-5-88167-030-6 |accessdate=18 September 2018 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6vmcoqT4R?url=http://biblmdkz.ru/gimn.html |archivedate=17 December 2017 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{YouTube|kyknqmZhyIk|''Anthem "To Health via Culture."''}}). Another anthem by [[Victor Skumin#Literary and publishing activities|Skumin]] is termed "Urusvati". [[Helena Roerich]], known as the ''[[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]] Urusvati'' in Agni Yoga and [[Rerikhism]]. This anthem begins with the phrase, "The fire of the heart ignites Urusvati, she teaches the spirit take-off on the wings of the grace".

'''''Amour de soi''''' (French, "self-love") is a concept in the philosophy of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] that refers to the kind of [[self-love]] that humans share with brute animals and predates the appearance of society. Acts committed out of ''amour de soi'' tend to be for individual well-being. They are naturally good and not malicious because ''amour de soi'' as self-love does not involve pursuing one's self-interest at the expense of others. The sentiment does not compare oneself with others, but is concerned solely with regarding oneself as an absolute and valuable existence. It is related to an awareness of one's future and can restrain present impulse. Rousseau contrasts it with ''[[amour-propre]]'', that kind of self-love, found in [[Thomas Hobbes]]' philosophy, in which one's opinion of oneself is dependent on what other people think and which arises only with society.

Rousseau suggested that ''amour de soi'' was lost during the transition from the pre-societal condition to society, but it can be restored by the use of "good" institutions created with the [[social contract]]. This renewed passage from the [[state of nature]] to the civilized state, would bring man to favor [[justice]] instead of [[instinct]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Derathé, ''Jean-Jacques Rousseau et la science politique de son temps'', Paris, Librairie Philosophique J. Vrin, 1995, pp. 135-141.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''world soul''' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: ψυχὴ κόσμου ''psuchè kósmou'', [[Latin]]: ''anima mundi'') is, according to several systems of thought, an intrinsic connection between all living things on the planet, which relates to our world in much the same way as the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] is connected to the human body.   [[Plato]] adhered to this idea and it was an important component of most [[Neoplatonic]] systems:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Therefore, we may consequently state that: this world is indeed a living being endowed with a soul and intelligence ... a single visible living entity containing all other living entities, which by their nature are all related.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plato]], ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'', 30b–c, 33b.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Stoicism|Stoics]] believed it to be the only vital force in the universe. Similar concepts also hold in systems of [[eastern philosophy]] in the [[Brahman]]-[[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] of [[Hinduism]], the [[Buddha-Nature]] in [[Mahayana Buddhism]],{{fact|date=May 2016}} and in the [[Hundred Schools of Thought#School of Yin-yang|School of Yin-Yang]], [[Hundred Schools of Thought#Taoism|Taoism]], and [[Neo-Confucianism#World view|Neo-Confucianism]] as ''[[qi]]''.

Other resemblances can be found in the thoughts of [[Hermeticism|hermetic]] philosophers like [[Paracelsus]], and by [[Baruch Spinoza]], [[Gottfried Leibniz]], [[Friedrich Schelling]] and in [[Hegel]]'s ''[[Geist]]'' ("Spirit"/"Mind"). [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] published "The Over-Soul" in 1841, which was influenced by the Hindu conception of a ''universal soul''. There are also similarities with ideas developed since the 1960s by [[Gaia Theory|Gaia theorists]] such as [[James Lovelock]].{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

In Jewish mysticism, a parallel concept is that of "[[Chokhmah]] Ila'ah," the all-encompassing "Supernal Wisdom" that transcends, orders and vitalizes all of creation. Rabbi [[Nachman of Breslov]] states that this sublime wisdom may be apprehended (or perhaps "channeled") by a perfect [[tzaddik]] (holy man).&lt;ref&gt;Likutey Moharan I, 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the tzaddik attains "[[cosmic consciousness]]" and thus is empowered to mitigate all division and conflict within creation.

'''Anthropopathism''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ἄνθρωπος ''anthropos'', "human" and πάθος ''pathos'', "suffering") is the attribution of human [[emotion]]s, or the ascription of [[human]] [[feeling]]s or [[passions]] to a non-[[human being]], generally to a [[deity]].

By comparison, the term [[anthropomorphism]] originally referred to the attribution of human form to a non-human being, but in modern usage anthropomorphism has come to encompass both meanings.

==Religion==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}
This is a technique prevalent in religious writings, where, for instance, [[human]] [[emotion]] is attributed to [[God]], where he would not normally experience emotion in this sense.
This technique is particularly notable in the book of [[Genesis (Hebrew Bible)|Genesis]], as an example of the theme of God as a [[personal god]]. Some Bible scholars, however, argue that human emotions ascribed to God are indicative of divine responses within the matrix of human history that are in fact analogous to human emotions though not univocal.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="890">An '''aporime''' is a problem difficult to resolve, and which has never been resolved, though it may not be, in itself, impossible.

The word is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''{{lang|grc|ἄπορον}}'', which signifies something very difficult and impracticable, being formed from the privative ''α'', and ''{{lang|grc|πόρος}}'', "passage". When a question was proposed to any of the [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] philosophers, especially of the sect of [[Academists]], if he could not give a solution, his answer was ''{{lang|grc|ἀποροῶ}}'', q.d. "I do not conceive it; I cannot see through it; I am not able to clear it up."

'''Arborescent''' ({{lang-fr|arborescent}}) is a term used by the French thinkers [[Deleuze]] and [[Guattari]] to characterize thinking marked by insistence on [[Universality (philosophy)|totalizing]] principles, [[binarism]], and [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]]. The term, first used in ''[[A Thousand Plateaus]]'' (1980) where it was opposed to the [[rhizome (metaphor)|rhizome]], comes from the way [[genealogy tree]]s are drawn: unidirectional [[progress (history)|progress]], with no possible retroactivity and continuous binary cuts (thus enforcing a dualist metaphysical conception, criticized by Deleuze). Rhizomes, on the contrary, mark a horizontal and non-hierarchical conception, where anything may be linked to anything else, with no respect whatsoever for specific [[species]]: rhizomes are [[heterogeneity|heterogeneous]] links between things that have nothing to do between themselves (for example, Deleuze and Guattari linked together desire and [[machine]]s to create the - most surprising - concept of [[desiring-production|desiring machine]]s). [[Horizontal gene transfer]] is also an example of rhizomes, opposed to the arborescent [[evolutionism]] theory. Deleuze also criticizes the [[Chomsky hierarchy]] of [[formal languages]], which he considers a perfect example of arborescent dualistic theory.&lt;ref&gt; [[Gilles Deleuze|Deleuze, Gilles]] and [[Félix Guattari | Guattari, Félix]]. 1980.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9058">The '''argument from a proper basis''' is an [[ontological argument]] for the [[existence of God]] related to [[fideism]]. [[Alvin Plantinga]] argued that belief in God is a properly [[basic belief]], and so no basis for belief in God is necessary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.origins.org/articles/plantinga_intellectualsophistication.html Origins.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051225232043/http://origins.org/articles/plantinga_intellectualsophistication.html |date=2005-12-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alvin Plantinga==

The best-known defender of this argument is Alvin Plantinga. According to the argument from a proper basis, belief in God can be rational and justified even without arguments or evidence for the existence of God. More specifically, Plantinga argues that belief in God is [[properly basic]], and, owing to a religious [[Internalism and externalism|externalist]] epistemology, he claims belief in God could be justified independently of evidence. His externalist epistemology, called "Proper functionalism", is a form of [[epistemological]] [[reliabilism]].&lt;ref&gt;
Compare [https://sites.google.com/site/filosofiariformata/descrizioni-di-scuole-di-pensiero-e-autori/epistemologia-riformata "''L'epistemologia riformata'' (Plantinga)"], article on ''Philosophia Reformata''. {{it icon}} Accessed 3 May 2016
&lt;/ref&gt;

Plantinga discusses his view of Reformed epistemology and proper functionalism in a three-volume series. In the first book of the trilogy, ''Warrant: The Current Debate'', Plantinga introduces, analyzes, and criticizes 20th-century developments in analytic epistemology, particularly the works of [[Roderick Chisholm]], [[Laurence BonJour]], [[William Alston]], and [[Alvin Goldman]].&lt;ref&gt;Alvin Plantinga, ''Warrant: The Current Debate'', New York: Oxford University Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Plantinga argues that the theories of what he calls "warrant"—what many others have called [[Theory of justification|justification]] (Plantinga draws out a difference: justification is a matter of fulfilling one's epistemic duties, whereas warrant is what transforms true belief into knowledge)—put forth by these epistemologists have failed to capture in full what is required for knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Plantinga, ''Warrant: The Current Debate'', 1993. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second book of his three book philosophical series, ''Warrant and Proper Function'', he introduces the notion of warrant as an alternative to justification and discusses topics like self-knowledge, memories, perception, and probability.&lt;ref&gt;
Alvin Plantinga, ''Warrant and Proper Function'', New York: Oxford University Press, 1993.
&lt;/ref&gt; Plantinga's "proper function" account argues that as a necessary condition of having warrant, one's "belief-forming and belief-maintaining apparatus of powers" are functioning properly—"working the way it ought to work".&lt;ref&gt;WPF, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Plantinga explains his argument for proper function with reference to a "design plan", as well as an environment in which one's cognitive equipment is optimal for use. Plantinga asserts that the design plan does not require a designer: "it is perhaps possible that [[Evolution (term) | evolution]] (undirected by God or anyone else) has somehow furnished us with our design plans",&lt;ref&gt;WPF, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; but the paradigm case of a design plan is like a technological product designed by a human being (like a radio or a wheel). Ultimately, Plantinga argues that epistemological [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]]- i.e. [[epistemology]] that holds that warrant is dependent on natural faculties – is best supported by supernaturalist metaphysics – in this case the belief in a [[creator God]] or in some designer who has laid out a design plan that includes cognitive faculties conducive to attaining knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;WPF, 237.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Plantinga, a belief, B, is warranted if:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
(1) the cognitive faculties involved in the production of B are functioning properly…; (2) your cognitive environment is sufficiently similar to the one for which your cognitive faculties are designed; (3) … the design plan governing the production of the belief in question involves, as purpose or function, the production of true beliefs…; and (4) the design plan is a good one: that is, there is a high statistical or objective probability that a belief produced in accordance with the relevant segment of the design plan in that sort of environment is true.&lt;ref&gt;Plantinga, ''Warrant and Proper Function'', 1993. 194.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Plantinga seeks to defend this view of proper function against alternative views of proper function proposed by other philosophers which he groups together as "naturalistic", including the "functional generalization" view of [[John L. Pollock|John Pollock]], the evolutionary/etiological account provided by [[Ruth Millikan]], and a dispositional view held by [[John Bigelow]] and [[Robert Pargetter]].&lt;ref&gt;WPF, p. 199-211.&lt;/ref&gt; Plantinga also discusses his [[#Evolutionary argument against naturalism|evolutionary argument against naturalism]] in the later chapters of ''Warrant and Proper Function''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Fales | first1 = E. | title = Plantinga's Case against Naturalistic Epistemology | journal = Philosophy of Science | volume = 63 | issue = 3 | pages = 432–451 | doi = 10.1086/289920 | year = 1996 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000 Plantinga's third volume, ''Warranted Christian Belief'', was published. In this volume, Plantinga's warrant theory is the basis for his theological end: providing a philosophical basis for Christian belief, an argument for why Christian theistic belief can enjoy warrant. In the book, he develops two models for such beliefs, the "A/C" ([[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]]/[[John Calvin|Calvin]]) model, and the "Extended A/C" model. The former attempts to show that a belief in God can be justified, warranted and rational, while the Extended model tries to show that core Christian theological beliefs, including the [[Trinity]], the [[Incarnation]], the resurrection of [[Jesus Christ|Christ]], the [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]], salvation, etc.{{huh?|date=January 2017}} can be warranted. Under this model, Christians are warranted in their beliefs because of the work of the [[Holy Spirit]] in bringing those beliefs about in the believer.

==Objections==

===The Great Pumpkin Objection===

The best known objection to the argument from a proper basis is known as '[[The Great Pumpkin]] Objection'. Alvin Plantinga brought it up in his 1983 book ''Warrant: The Current Debate'', and described it as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is tempting to raise the following sort of question. If belief in God can be properly basic, why cannot just any belief be properly basic? Could we not say the same for any bizarre aberration we can think of? What about voodoo or astrology? What about the belief that [[the Great Pumpkin]] returns every Halloween? Could I properly take that as basic? Suppose I believe that if I flap my arms with sufficient vigor, I can take off and fly about the room; could I defend myself against the charge of irrationality by claiming this belief is basic? If we say that belief in God is properly basic, will we not be committed to holding that just anything, or nearly anything, can properly be taken as basic, thus throwing wide the gates to irrationalism and superstition? (p. 74)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Rebuttal====

Plantinga's answer to this line of thinking is that the objection simply assumes that the criteria for "proper basicality" propounded by [[Foundationalism#Classical foundationalism|classical foundationalism]] (self-evidence, incorrigibility, and sense-perception) are the only possible criteria for properly basic beliefs. It is as if the Great Pumpkin objector feels that if properly basic beliefs cannot be arrived at by way of one of these criteria, then it follows that just 'any' belief could then be properly basic, precisely because there are no other criteria. But Plantinga says it simply doesn't follow from the rejection of classical foundationalist criteria that all possibility for criteria has been exhausted and this is exactly what the Great Pumpkin objection assumes.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Plantinga takes his counter-argument further, asking how the great pumpkin objector "knows" that such criteria are the only criteria. The objector certainly seems to hold it as 'basic' that the classical foundationalist criteria are all that is available. Yet, such a claim is neither self-evident, incorrigible, nor evident to the senses. This rebuts the Great Pumpkin objection by demonstrating the classical foundationalist position to be internally incoherent, propounding an epistemic position which it itself does not follow.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''Axial Age''' (also '''Axis Age''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title =Introducing Philosophy of Religion | last =Meister | first = Chad | year= 2009 | publisher= Routledge | location = Abingdon | pages=10 | isbn=0-203-88002-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; from {{lang-de|Achsenzeit}}) is a term coined by [[Germany|German]] [[philosopher]] [[Karl Jaspers]] in the sense of a  "pivotal age" characterizing the period of [[ancient history]] from about the 8th to the 3rd century BCE.

Then, according to Jaspers' concept, new ways of thinking appeared in [[History of Iran|Persia]], [[History of India|India]], [[Zhou dynasty|China]] and the [[Classical antiquity|Greco-Roman world]] in [[religion]] and [[philosophy]], in a striking parallel development, without any obvious direct cultural contact between all of the participating [[Eurasia]]n cultures. Jaspers identified key thinkers from this age who had a profound influence on future philosophies and religions, and identified characteristics common to each area from which those thinkers emerged. 

Jaspers' approach to the culture of the middle of the [[first millennium BC]] has been adopted by other scholars and academics, and has become a point of discussion in the [[history of religion]].

==Definition==
Jaspers introduced the concept of an Axial Age in his book ''Vom Ursprung und Ziel der Geschichte'' (''The Origin and Goal of History''&lt;ref name="Jaspers"&gt;Karl Jaspers, '' Origin and Goal of History'', Routledge Revivals, 2011, {{ISBN|978-0415578806}}&lt;/ref&gt;), published in 1949. The simultaneous appearance of thinkers and philosophers in different areas of the world had been remarked by numerous authors since the 18th century, notably by the French Indologist [[Abraham Hyacinthe Anquetil-Duperron]].&lt;ref name="Metzler2009" /&gt; Jaspers explicitly cited some of these authors, including [[Victor von Strauß]] (1859) and [[Peter Ernst von Lasaulx ]](1870).&lt;ref name="Metzler2009"&gt;{{cite journal
|last1=Metzler|first1=Dieter
|title=Achsenzeit als Ereignis und Geschichte
|trans-title=Axial age as happening and history |language=German
|journal=Internet-Beiträge zur Ägyptologie und Sudanarchäologie (IBAES)|date=2009|volume=10|url=http://www2.hu-berlin.de/nilus/net-publications/ibaes10/publikation/metzler_ibaes10.pdf|accessdate=17 January 2018|page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Jasper's contribution was to claim that the Axial Age should be viewed as an objective empirical fact of history, independently of religious considerations.&lt;ref&gt;Jaspers K.,''The Origin and Goal of History'', p.1&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that during the Axial Age, "the spiritual foundations of humanity were laid simultaneously and independently in China, India, Persia, Judea, and Greece. And these are the foundations upon which humanity still subsists today".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Jaspers | first = Karl | title = The Way to Wisdom : An Introduction to Philosophy | publisher = Yale University Press | year = 2003 | location = New Haven, CT |page=98 | isbn = 0-300-09735-2 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=IfAgyKFpWaEC&amp;pg=PA98}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

He identified a number of key thinkers as having had a profound influence on future philosophies and religions, and identified characteristics common to each area from which those thinkers emerged. Jaspers held up this age as unique, and one to which the rest of the [[history of ideas|history of human thought]] might be compared.

==Characteristics==
Jaspers presented his first outline of the Axial age by a series of examples:

{{quote|[[Confucius]] and [[Lao-Tse]] were living in China, all the schools of Chinese philosophy came into being, including those of [[Mo Ti]], [[Zhuang Zhou|Chuang Tse]], [[Lieh Tzu]] and a host of others; India produced the [[Upanishads]] and [[Buddha]] and, like China, ran the whole gamut of philosophical possibilities down to [[materialism]], [[scepticism]] and [[nihilism]]; in Iran [[Zarathustra]] taught a challenging view of the world as a struggle between good and evil; in Palestine the prophets made their appearance from [[Elijah]] by way of [[Isaiah]] and [[Jeremiah]] to [[Deutero-Isaiah]]; Greece witnessed the appearance of [[Homer]], of the philosophers – [[Parmenides]], [[Heraclitus]] and [[Plato]], – of the tragedians, of [[Thucydides]] and [[Archimedes]]. Everything implied by these names developed during these few centuries almost simultaneously in China, India and the West.|Karl Jaspers, ''Origin and Goal of History'', p. 2}}
[[File:Karl Jaspers 1946.jpg|thumb|258x258px|Jaspers argued that the Axial Age gave birth to philosophy as a discipline]]
Jaspers described the Axial Age as "an interregnum between two ages of great [[empire]], a pause for [[liberty]], a deep breath bringing the most lucid consciousness".&lt;ref name="Jaspers51"&gt;{{Harvnb | Jaspers | 1953 | p = 51}} quoted in {{Harvnb | Armstrong | 2006 | p = 367}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested that the Axial Age was a historically [[Liminality|liminal]] period, when old certainties had lost their validity and new ones were still not ready.&lt;ref name = "Thomassen"&gt;{{citation | last = Thomassen | first= Bjorn | authorlink= Bjorn Thomassen | journal = Anthropological Theory |volume = 10 | number = 4 | year=2010 | pages = 321–42 | title = Anthropology, multiple modernities and the axial age debate | url= http://ant.sagepub.com/content/10/4/321.full.pdf+html | doi= 10.1177/1463499610386659}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Jaspers had a particular interest in the similarities in circumstance and thought of its figures. Similarities included an engagement in the quest for human meaning&lt;ref name = "Neville"&gt;{{cite book | last = Neville | first = Robert Cummings | title=Religion in Late Modernity | url= https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN079145424X&amp;id=OWkrdZ2yh3EC&amp;pg=PA104&amp;vq=%22Axial+Age | year = 2002 | publisher = SUNY Press | isbn =0-7914-5424-X | page = 104}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the rise of a new [[elite]] class of religious leaders and thinkers in China, India and the Occident.&lt;ref name="Eisenstadt"&gt;{{cite book | last= Eisenstadt | first= SN | authorlink = Shmuel Eisenstadt | title = The Origins and Diversity of Axial Age Civilizations | year=1986 | publisher= SUNY Press | isbn = 0-88706-094-3 | pages=1–2 | chapter = Introduction | chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0887060943&amp;id=OFGIYBK2hu8C&amp;pg=PA1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

These spiritual foundations were laid by individual thinkers within a framework of a changing social environment. Jaspers argues that the characteristics appeared under similar political circumstances: China, India, the Middle East and the Occident each comprised multiple small states engaged in internal and external struggles.
The three regions all gave birth to, and then institutionalized, a tradition of travelling scholars, who roamed from city to city to exchange ideas. After the [[Spring and Autumn period]] and the [[Warring States period]], [[Taoism]] and [[Confucianism]] emerged in China. In other regions, the scholars were largely from extant religious traditions; in India, from [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Jainism]]; in Persia, from [[Zoroastrianism]]; in [[The Levant]], from [[Judaism]]; and in Greece, from [[Sophist|Sophism]] and other classical philosophies.

Many of the cultures of the axial age were considered second-generation societies because they were built on the societies that preceded them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Worlds Together Worlds Apart |last=Pollard |last2=Rosenberg |last3=Tignor |first= Elizabeth |first2=Clifford |first3=Robert|publisher = Norton|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-393-91847-2|location = NewYork|pages = 162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Buddhism]], also of the sramana tradition of India, was another of the world's most influential philosophies, founded by [[Siddhartha Gautama]], or the Buddha, who lived during this period; its spread was aided by [[Ashoka]], who lived late in the period.

In China, the [[Hundred Schools of Thought]] were in contention and [[Confucianism]] and [[Taoism]] arose during this era, and in this area it remains a profound influence on social and religious life.

[[Zoroastrianism]], another of Jaspers' examples, is one of the first monotheistic religions and some believe it greatly influenced modern Abrahamic religions with such conceptions as the devil and Heaven/Hell.&lt;ref name = "Boyce1979"&gt;{{cite book|last=Boyce|first= Mary | authorlink = Mary Boyce | title = Zoroastrians: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices| publisher= Routledge| location= London| year= 1979 | isbn = 0-415-23903-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exact date of [[Zoroaster]]'s life is debated by scholars, with some, such as Mary Boyce, arguing that Zoroastrianism itself is significantly older.&lt;ref name= "Boyce1979" /&gt; Others, such as William W Malandra and RC Zaehner, suggest that he may indeed have been an early contemporary of Cyrus living around 600 BC.&lt;ref name = "Malandra1983"&gt;{{cite book|last=Malandra|first=William|authorlink=William W.

Jaspers' axial shifts included the rise of [[Platonism]], which would later become a major influence on the Western world through both [[Christianity]] and secular thought throughout the [[Middle Ages]] and into the [[Renaissance]].

==Reception==
In addition to Jaspers, the philosopher [[Eric Voegelin]] referred to this age as ''The Great Leap of Being'', constituting a new spiritual awakening and a shift of perception from societal to individual values.&lt;ref name = "Voegelin1985"&gt;{{cite book| last= Voegelin|first= Eric|authorlink= Eric Voegelin| series= Collected Works | volume = 18 | title=Order and History (Volume V): In Search of Order|location=Columbia, [[Missouri|MO]] | publisher = The University of Missouri Press| year= 2000| origyear= 1985| isbn= 978-0-8262-1261-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thinkers and teachers like the Buddha, [[Pythagoras]], [[Heraclitus]], [[Parmenides]], and [[Anaxagoras]] contributed to such awakenings which Plato would later call ''[[anamnesis (philosophy)|anamnesis]]'', or a remembering of things forgotten.

[[David Christian (historian)|David Christian]] notes that the first "universal religions" appeared in the age of the first universal [[empire]]s and of the first all-encompassing [[trading network]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Christian | first1 = David | author-link1 = David Christian (historian) | title = Maps of Time: An Introduction to Big History | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=VUqZl7RdNtwC | series = California World History Library | volume = 2 | publisher = University of California Press | publication-date = 2004 | page = 319 | isbn = 978-0-520-23500-7 | accessdate = 2013-12-29 | quote = Not until the first millennium BCE do the first universal religions appear. Though associated in practice with particular dynasties or empires, they proclaimed universal truths and worshiped all-powerful gods. It is no accident that universal religions appeared when both empires and exchange networks reached to the edge of the known universe. Nor is it an accident that one of the earliest religions of this type, Zoroastrianism, appeared in the largest empire of the mid-first millennium BCE, that of the Achaemenids, and at the hub of trade routes that were weaving Afro-Eurasia into a single world system. Indeed, most of the universal religions appeared in the hub region between Mesopotamia and northern India. They included Zoroastrianism and Manichaeism in Persia, Buddhism in India, Confucianism in China, and Judaism, Christianity and Islam in the Mediterranean world.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anthropology|Anthropologist]] [[David Graeber]] has pointed out that "the core period of Jasper's Axial age [...] corresponds almost exactly to the period in which coinage was invented.  What's more, the three parts of the world where coins were first invented were also the very parts of the world where those sages lived; in fact, they became the epicenters of Axial Age religious and philosophical creativity."&lt;ref name = "Graeber"&gt;{{Harvnb | Graeber | 2011 | p = 224}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing on the work of classicist [[Richard Seaford]] and literary theorist [[Marc Shell]] on the relation between coinage and early Greek thought, Graeber argues that an understanding of the rise of markets is necessary to grasp the context in which the religious and philosophical insights of the Axial age arose. The ultimate effect of the introduction of coinage was, he argues, an "ideal division of spheres of human activity that endures to this day: on the one hand the market, on the other, religion."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb | Graeber | 2011 | p = 249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

German sociologist [[Max Weber]] played an important role in Jaspers' thinking.&lt;ref name= "Stanford"&gt;{{cite web | year=2006 | title = Karl Jaspers | work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/jaspers/ | accessdate= 2006-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Szakolczai"&gt;{{cite book | first=Arpad | last=Szakolczai | year=2003 | title=The Genesis of Modernity | edition= First hardcover | publisher =Routledge | location=UK | isbn=0-415-25305-5 | pages=80–81 | url = https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0415253055&amp;id=hGduSwFHFSEC&amp;pg=PA80&amp;lpg=PA80&amp;dq=Jaspers+%22Axial+Age%22+characteristics&amp;sig=O9S_5-pSxgMIPz8Ocn8RrgofkPU}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "EoST"&gt;{{cite book | first=Arpad | last=Szakolczai | year=2006 | title=Encyclopedia of Social Theory | chapter = Historical sociology | publisher = Routledge | location=UK | isbn=0-415-29046-5|chapterurl= https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0415290465&amp;id=LrBrWXtez8YC&amp;pg=PA251&amp;lpg=PA251&amp;vq=Axial+Age&amp;dq=%22The+Axial+Age:+The+Emergence+of+Transcendental+Visions+and+the+Rise+of+Clerics%22&amp;sig=g0mBSYAPnOEiXYGHR-j8hpuQPVM | page = 251}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shmuel Eisenstadt]] argues in the introduction to ''The Origins and Diversity of Axial Age Civilizations'' that Weber's work in his ''[[The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism]]'', ''[[The Religion of India: The Sociology of Hinduism and Buddhism]]'' and ''[[Ancient Judaism (book)|Ancient Judaism]]'' provided a background for the importance of the period, and notes parallels with [[Eric Voegelin]]'s ''Order and History''.&lt;ref name="Eisenstadt" /&gt; Wider acknowledgement of Jaspers' work came after it was presented at a conference and published in ''[[Daedalus (journal)|Dædalus]]'' in 1975, and Jaspers' suggestion that the period was uniquely transformative generated important discussion amongst other scholars, such as Johann Arnason.&lt;ref name = "EoST" /&gt; In literature, [[Gore Vidal]] in his novel [[Creation (novel)|''Creation'']] covers much of this Axial Age through the fictional perspective of a Persian adventurer.

[[Shmuel Eisenstadt]] analyses economic circumstances relating to the coming of the Axial Age in Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WsUKbgh_A1YC|title=The Origins and Diversity of Axial Age Civilizations|publisher=SUNY Press|year=|isbn=9781438401942|series=SUNY series in Near Eastern Studies|location=|publication-date=2012|page=31|pages=|chapter=Introduction: The Axial Age Breakthrough in Ancient Greece|quote=The emergence of this specific type of Axial Age breakthrough was connected with the special mode of disintegration of the tribal communities and of construction of new collectivities and institutional complexes.

Armstrong argues that the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] was a "Second Axial Age", including thinkers such as [[Isaac Newton]], [[Sigmund Freud]], and [[Albert Einstein]]. It has also been suggested that the [[modern era]] is a new axial age, wherein relationships between religion, secularity, and traditional thought are changing.&lt;ref name="modern"&gt;{{cite journal | first =Yves | last = Lambert | title= Religion in Modernity as a New Axial Age: Secularization or New Religious Forms? | journal=Sociology of Religion | year=1999 | volume=60 | issue= | pages= 303|url = https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=98493653 | doi= 10.2307/3711939}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bertrand Russell leads anti-nuclear march in London, Feb 1961.jpg|thumb|[[Bertrand Russell]] with his wife, [[Edith Finch Russell]], leading an anti-nuclear demonstration in February 1961]]
The '''Bertrand Russell Society''' is a [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit]] [[learned society]] whose purpose is to foster a better understanding of [[Bertrand Russell]] and his work. The Society was founded in 1974 by, among others, [[Lady Katharine Tait]], Russell's only daughter.

The Society publishes the ''[https://bertrandrussellsociety.org/bulletin/ Bertrand Russell Society Bulletin]'', and all members receive ''[https://mulpress.mcmaster.ca/russelljournal/ Russell: the Journal of Bertrand Russell Studies]''. The Society holds an annual meeting, and offers numerous prizes for literature and other work. The Society also sponsors talks in conjunction with the [[American Philosophical Association]] ([https://www.apaonline.org/default.aspx APA]) and the Society for the Study of the History of Analytical Philosophy ([http://sshap.org/ SSHAP]).

==Aims and Motto==
[[File:Bust Of Bertrand Russell-Red Lion Square-London.jpg|thumb|Bust of [[Bertrand Russell]] in [[Red Lion Square]]]]
The Bertrand Russell Society has three aims ([http://bertrandrussell.org/brs-bylaws/ Bylaws, Article 2]): 

# to promote interest in the life and work of Bertrand Russell; 
# to bring together persons interested in any aspect of the foregoing; 
# to promote causes that Russell championed.

The BRS motto is: "The good life is one inspired by love and guided by knowledge."
-Bertrand Russell (1925) "What I Believe"; cited from p.&amp;nbsp;349 in [http://emilkirkegaard.dk/en/wp-content/uploads/The-Basic-Writings-of-Bertrand-Russell.pdf ''The Basic Writings of Bertrand Russell''] (Routledge Classics, New York: 2009).

==About==
[[File:Russell in 1924 01.jpg|thumb|[[Bertrand Russell]] in 1924, pipe in hand]]
Founded in 1974, the Bertrand Russell Society seeks to foster a better understanding of the life, work, and writings of Bertrand Russell (1872-1970) and how his contributions relate to today’s world. The Society has a regular annual meeting featuring scholarly and popular presentations about Russell and related subjects, a business meeting, a banquet, and good fellowship. Usually in June, most often in a university setting, annual meetings have taken place at wide variety of [https://bertrandrussellsociety.org/past-meetings/ locations].

The Society publishes the ''Bertrand Russell Society [http://bertrandrussellsociety.org/join/bulletin/ Bulletin]'', which is free to all members. Interested persons are invited to submit papers to the editor, William Bruneau. Members also receive the scholarly journal [https://escarpmentpress.org/russelljournal ''Russell''].

The [http://bertrandrussell.org/html/Stanley_Library/library.html Bertrand Russell Society Library] has a collection of Russell-related books and papers that members can borrow and a large selection of television and radio interviews of Russell online in the members area of the Library. Members of the Bertrand Russell Society may [https://bertrandrussellsociety.org/contact/ contact us] for access.

The Society awards annual [https://bertrandrussellsociety.org/student-paper-prize/ student-paper-prizes] for the best new papers about Russell by undergraduate and graduate students. Prize-winners present their papers at our annual meeting, receive $200, free registration, lodging and banquet at the meeting, and a 1-year membership in the BRS.

The Society also awards an annual [https://bertrandrussellsociety.org/book-award/ BRS Book Award] for the best new book on Russell, an annual [https://bertrandrussellsociety.org/brs-award/ BRS Award] to an individual or an organization whose work best furthers the interests and commitments of Bertrand Russell, and the [https://bertrandrussellsociety.org/lee-eisler-service-award/ Lee Eisler Service Award] for service to the Russell Society.

The Society sponsors sessions of talks on Russell and early analytic philosophy more generally at meetings of the [[American Philosophical Association]] ([https://www.apaonline.org/default.aspx APA]), often in conjunction with the Society for the Study of the History of Analytical Philosophy ([http://sshap.org/ SSHAP]).

The Society helps support Russell scholarship, for example, the scholarly journal ''Russell: The Journal of Bertrand Russell Studies'', which all BRS members receive as part of their membership, and maintains these web pages to provide information on Russell and related subjects and to further our shared interests and values.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2715">'''Biofacticity''' is a philosophical concept that allows to identify a living [[Object (philosophy)|object]] as a so-called [[Biofact (philosophy)|biofact]], i.e. a semi-natural living entity which has been biotechnically interfered during its life-span such as [[transgenic]] plants or cloned organisms. In [[philosophy]], [[sociology]] and the [[arts]], a biofact stands in close relation to the anthropological concept of the human being a composite of [[nature]] and [[technology]]. Biofact was introduced to philosophy as a [[neologism]] in 2001 by the German philosopher [[Nicole C. Karafyllis]] and fuses the words [[Artifact_(archaeology)|artifact]] and the prefix "bio". One of Karafyllis' thesis is that a technical change in living objects, i.e. an increase in biofacticity, will shift the anthropological concept of hybridity towards a technological self-definition of the human.

== Biofacticity vs. hybridity ==
Hybridity takes into account the anthropological fact that humans are hybrid with both natural and technical essences, making them designers with an individual "''Leib''," which is a term in phenomenology that denotes subjectivity of one's own [[Corporeal substance|corporeality]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Tensions and Convergences: Technological And Aesthetic Transformations of Society|last=Heil|first=Reinhard|last2=Kaminski|first2=Andreas|last3=Stippak|first3=Marcus|last4=Unger|first4=Alexander|last5=Ziegler|first5=Marc|publisher=Transcript|year=2007|isbn=9783899425185|location=Bielefeld|pages=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biofacticity, on the other hand, is an [[Epistemology|epistemological]] and [[Ontology|ontological]] term that reflects upon the anthropological term of [[hybridity]]. The latter deals with the self-definition of subjects rather than objects. Hybridity, thus, is an anthropological concept particularly when used for philosophical purposes while biofacticity is an epistemological concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Ethics of Today's Science and Technology: A German-Chinese Approach|last=Poser|first=Hans|last2=Li|first2=Wenchao|publisher=LIT Verlag Munster|year=2008|isbn=9783825813635|location=Berlin|pages=186}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these concepts demonstrate the hybrid character of the human being as a growing and creative entity who acts in light of self-determined ends. Theorists cite that this view becomes a broad approach in understanding the idea of life not merely as a biological process or functions of the [[Gene|genetic]] code.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''Black Cat Analogy''' is an [[analogy]], accounting for the differences, mainly between [[science]] and [[religion]], but also between others, such as [[philosophy]] and [[metaphysics]].

==Description==
The analogy can be described like this:

*Philosophy is like being in a dark room and looking for a black cat.
*Metaphysics is like being in a dark room and looking for a black cat that isn't there.
*Theology is like being in a dark room and looking for a black cat that isn't there, and shouting "I found it!"
*Science is like being in a dark room looking for a black cat while using a flashlight.

It can also be applied to other bodies of knowledge or learning, for example by [[Ernest Gellner]] to [[Marxism]].&lt;ref name=doniger/&gt;

==Explanation==
Vincent Barry explains the difference between philosophy and [[theology]] as lying in the fact that philosophy is scientific and open-minded, concerned with proof, while theologians "have found their final truth" before they begin the search.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barry|first=Vincent|title=Bioethics in a Cultural Context|date=2011|publisher=Cengage|page=65|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ie0XO1aKVSsC&amp;lpg=PA65&amp;ots=yWfum64HEM&amp;dq=Philosophy%20is%20like%20being%20in%20a%20dark%20room%20and%20looking%20for%20a%20black%20cat.&amp;pg=PA65#v=onepage&amp;q=Philosophy%20is%20like%20being%20in%20a%20dark%20room%20and%20looking%20for%20a%20black%20cat.&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
Many variations on the analogy exist, and they have been variously attributed to several famous figures at different times (e.g. [https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin#Misquoted misquotations of Charles Darwin]), but the quotation has been around since at least the 1890s.&lt;ref name="Quote Investigator 15 February 2015"&gt;{{cite web | title= A Blind Man in a Dark Room Looking for a Black Cat That Is Not There |url= http://quoteinvestigator.com/2015/02/15/hidden-cat/ | first= Garson| last= O’Toole| date= 15 February 2015| website= Quote Investigator | accessdate= 4 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its absolute origin is unknown.&lt;ref name="Quote Investigator 19 February 2015"&gt;{{cite web | title= The Philosopher, the Theologian, and the Elusive Black Cat|url= http://quoteinvestigator.com/2015/02/19/philo-cat/| first= Garson| last= O’Toole| date= 19 February 2015| website= Quote Investigator | accessdate= 4 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commentators===
[[Wendy Doniger]] relates it to a French and English [[proverb]]: "In the dark, all cats are grey." [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] criticised naive ideas of the Absolute, which he ridiculed as "like a night, as people say, in which all cows are black." [[Dashiell Hammett]] in ''[[The Dain Curse]]'' (1929) referred to a "blind man in a dark room hunting for a black hat that wasn't there". [[Ernest Gellner]] referred to an [[East European]] joke about science, philosophy, and [[Marxism]] as looking for a cat in a dark room with various consequences: with science the cat is present, with philosophy absent, and with Marxism absent but found.&lt;ref name=doniger&gt;{{cite book|last=Doniger|first=Wendy|title=The Implied Spider|date=2011|publisher=Columbia University Press|pages=31–33|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=76Oh3p2vpe4C&amp;lpg=PA33&amp;ots=Ut0qmJjwux&amp;dq=Philosophy%20is%20like%20being%20in%20a%20dark%20room%20and%20looking%20for%20a%20black%20cat.&amp;pg=PA33#v=onepage&amp;q=Philosophy%20is%20like%20being%20in%20a%20dark%20room%20and%20looking%20for%20a%20black%20cat.&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1259">'''Byzantine rhetoric''' — of the [[Byzantine Empire]] — followed largely the precepts of ancient Greek rhetoricians, especially those belonging to the [[Second Sophistic]] that extended from the time of [[Augustus]] through the fifth century CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Greek Literature |first=Gregory |last=Nagy |year=2001 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-93771-X |pages=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rhetoric]] was the most important and difficult topic studied in the Byzantine education system, beginning at the  ''[[Pandidakterion]]'' in early fifth century [[Constantinople]], where the school emphasized the study of rhetoric with eight teaching chairs, five in Greek and three in Latin.&lt;ref name=jeffreys&gt;{{cite book|title=Rhetoric in Byzantium: Papers from the Thirty-Fifth Spring Symposium of Byzantine Studies |first=Elizabeth |last=Jeffreys |year=2003 |publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. |pages=39–43 |isbn=0-7546-3453-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hard training of Byzantine rhetoric provided skills and credentials for citizens to attain public office in the imperial service, or posts of authority within the Church.&lt;ref name=jeffreys/&gt;

Some philosophers {{who|date=September 2016}} believe that causality may not exist if determinism is true, as causality is merely the observation that one event precedes another, or that there is a pattern throughout spacetime in which events of one similar type tend to correlate with events of another similar type (that is, the mass-energy distribution in spacetime has an information theoretic 'pattern' where car crashes tend to be correlated with injury, say).  There may be no ultimate reason for why a chain of causality occurs the way that it does beyond the fact that a chain of causality exists.  The fact that certain events seem to 'cause' other events is the recognition of a pattern in the structure of spacetime and the mass-energy that exists in spacetime, which is ultimately either due OR an instantiation of the laws of physics.  Note: Stating that causality does not exist may be a bit misleading, as one would have to Define what is meant by 'causality' - it may be that causality is dependent upon [[counterfactual definiteness]], that is, A causes B because, if A did NOT occur, then B would not occur (i.e.: A is necessary for B) AND because A is sufficient for B.  It may be possible that causality is ultimately a meaningless concept (if one rejects [[counterfactual definiteness]] for instance), but that causal chains are still a valid concept (as they would merely be chains of events).

'''Chee Soo''' (born '''Clifford Soo''', also known as '''Clifford Gibbs''', 4 June 1919 – 29 August 1994) was an author of books about the philosophy of [[Taoism]] and in particular [[Lee-style t'ai chi ch'uan]], [[Qigong]], [[Ch'ang Ming]], [[Traditional Chinese Medicine]] and [[Feng Shou]] 'Hand of the Wind' [[Kung Fu]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
Born on 4 June 1919 in All Souls, [[Marylebone]], London, Chee Soo was the son of Ah Chee Soo, a Chinese seaman and a pastry chef at the Westminster restaurant. His English mother was Beatrice Annie Alice Gibbs. They lived in Westminster. Although he enlisted in the [[British Army]] under the name Clifford Gibbs, his mother's maiden name, in later life he took his father's name and was known as Chee Soo. In a 1977 [[LBC]] radio interview Chee Soo described meeting a Chinese Martial Arts teacher from [[Shandong]] called [[Chan Kam Lee]] in Hyde Park when he was fourteen years old. Chee Soo said he was invited to Chan Lee's class in the summer of 1934, and this was the beginning of his martial arts training. Chee Soo said that Chan Kam Lee adopted him as a nephew, and taught him the arts whenever his work and time permitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bufvc.ac.uk/tvandradio/lbc/index.php/segment/0010200177004 |title=Clifford Chee talks to Brian Hayes · British Universities Film &amp; Video Council |website=Bufvc.ac.uk |accessdate=27 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military career===
In 1937 Chee Soo joined the 2nd Battalion of the [[2nd Royal Tank Regiment|Royal Tank Regiment]] part of the 7th Armoured division known as the [[British 7th Armoured Division|Desert rats]]. During the Second World War, he was promoted to Lance-Corporal and Corporal in 1941, then to "Acting Serjeant" in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forces-war-records.co.uk/namesearch/?FirstName=Clifford&amp;Surname=Gibbs&amp;RecordType=Ww2&amp;RecordDateStartYear=1939&amp;RecordDateEndYear=1945 |accessdate=27 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the [[Military Medal]] after the [[Battle of Beda Fomm]] in Libya in February 1941, part of [[Operation Compass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seahorsearts.co.uk/images/history/chee_soo_military_medal.png |format=PNG |title=4 Armd Bds, 7 Arm Div., Gibbs, Clifford |publisher=Seahorses.co.uk |accessdate=27 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his regiment were transferred to Burma he was captured by the Japanese on 19 April 1942 during the [[Battle of Yenangyaung]] and forced to work on the [[Burma Railway|Death Railway]] as a [[Prisoner of war|POW]] where he contracted Malaria, he was later classified as a war crimes witness:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In 1939 the Second World War broke out, and Chee Soo did his share of fighting as a Tank Commander in the Second Battalion of the Royal Tank Corps, in France, in North Africa — where he won the Military Medal, and in Burma where, after a hectic battle, he was finally taken prisoner by the Japanese. He went through many periods of beatings, torture, starvation and very hard work as a member of a working party in the mountains between India and Burma. Finally, three years later, as the Japanese started to retreat from the advancing Allies, he managed to escape into the Shan Mountains of West Burma and made his way over very rugged terrain and through many jungles, till finally one month afterwards he was able to make contact with the Allies again. Three months after recuperation and treatment (for he then weighed only 84 lbs), he was flown back to England, where he was able to enjoy a long leave with his wife. After that, he was discharged from the forces and took a course in book-keeping, stock control, commercial history and sales promotion.
Chee Soo claimed that he managed to make contact with Chan Lee again after the war was finished, and the class in Holborn was restarted. In 1950, Chee Soo formed his own class in Manor Road School, West Ham, East London.&lt;ref&gt;Taoist Ways of Healing by Chee Soo page 139 (published by HarperCollins 1986)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The author [[Rupert Croft-Cooke]] who was Chee's friend from 1938 provides us with some biographical details of this period in Chee Soo's life in his book 'The Dogs of Peace'.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Clifford Gibbs had got his rather grand name from Dr Barnardo's Homes, for he had been reared in one of these, the son of a Chinese father and English mother, neither of whom he had ever seen. I had known him before the war and was as proud as he was of the Military Medal he had earned as a Corporal in the Royal Armoured Corps in North Africa. He had been sent to Burma and taken prisoner by the Japanese, and suffered unspeakable tortures and humiliations because of his race, separated as he was from his fellow British. He had survived and, inwardly as inscrutable as a Conrad character, a little like Wang in Victory, he had married a blonde English girl and had an exquisite baby daughter whose godfather I became at a Sunday afternoon service in an East End Anglican church.
Clifford, who went about life methodically, was severely industrious and found the means of saving for his family even in those days of grudging wages. But he had a humorous cheerful side to his character and enlivened my flat during his weekly visits between office hours and his return to Durban Street, E.15. He was an expert wrestler and had earned the Judo black belt. Only from the depths of his character emerged sometimes the exotic or oriental; in speech and manner he was very much an Englishman, and it was strange to hear from his curved lips words that might have been used by any London ex-soldier. I am glad to have had his friendship throughout those years.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rupert Croft-Cooke]] – ''The Dogs of Peace'', W.H.Allen and Co 1973 {{ISBN|0-491-00864-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Teaching the Taoist Arts===
Chee Soo said that after the death of his teacher Chan Kam Lee, he went on to become the President of the International Taoist Society {{Citation needed|reason=This claim is sourced only from Chee Soo himself, and needs backing up with independent sources that don't originate from Chee Soo, his writings, or coverage based on them. Assuming that such a prominent International society existed, there would be records that could be cited, so it's not unreasonable to ask for them.|date=March 2017}} and taught a variety of martial arts ranging from self-defence techniques to healing and spiritual disciplines based on Chinese Medicine, ch'i kung and meditation.

Chee Soo's daughter Lavinia Soo-Warr adds that Chee Soo began learning [[Judo]] and [[Kendo]] in London after World War 2, and followed this up with training in [[Aikido]] with [[Kenshiro Abbe]] after his arrival in London in 1955. This history states that Chee Soo "switched back to the Chinese arts", possibly influenced by his negative experiences as a Japanese prisoner-of-war during WW2. Lavinia states that Chee Soo began teaching a small group in Dunstable in "Ch'i Shu". This is probably the Aikido-influenced system which Chee Soo demonstrates and is called "Qi Shu" or "Chinese Aikido" in contemporary Movietone footage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vintage footage of Chee Soo Doing Qi Shu (Chinese Aikido)| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Glhigfam4X4 | access-date=8 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The history says that later "as the Chi'Shu and Kung Fu systems became more popular, he introduced Taijiquan and the Chang Ming Diet", which suggests that Chee Soo was not teaching Tai Chi up to this point. Lavinia's history says that Chee Soo changed his teachings fundamentally "at least three times" during his teaching career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Factual History of Chee Soo (English name, Clifford Gibbs) and Li Style Taijiquan| first=Lavinia | last=Soo-Warr | url=http://www.peterwarr.co.uk/wu-kung/articles-lavinia.asp | access-date=8 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Chee Soo, Chan Lee died in the winter of 1953–4 off the coast of China, near Canton, when the ship he was travelling in sank in a severe storm, and he was asked to take over the leadership of the association.&lt;ref&gt;Taoist Ways of Healing by Chee Soo pages 139–140 (published by HarperCollins 1986)&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the association has grown in The British Isles, Australia, South Africa, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Mauritius and New Zealand.

Chee Soo taught 'The Eight Strands of the Brocade', comprising :
*Ch'ang Ming 	—	Taoist long life health diet therapy
*Ts'ao Yao 	—    	Taoist herbal therapy
*Anmo          	—    	Taoist massage
*Tao Yin         –    	Taoist respiration therapy
*Tien Chen	—    	Taoist Acupressure (Spot Pressing)
*Chen Tuan	—    	Taoist diagnosis techniques
*Chili Nung	—    	(The way of occlusion)

There are two associations which are affiliated to the Chinese Cultural Arts Association and the International Wu Shu Association.&lt;ref&gt;Taoist Ways of Healing by Chee Soo pages 139–140 (published by HarperCollins 1986)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese Cultural Arts Association teach :
*T'ai chi ch'uan	—	The Supreme Ultimate
*K'ai Men	—	(Taoist Yoga or the Taoist form of Ch'i Kung)
*I Fu Shou	—	(Sticky Hands)
*Li Kung	        —	(Taoist development of Li energy)
*Mo Kun	        —	(Taoist Wand for Li energy control)
*Mo Hsiang 	—	(Taoist Meditation)
*T'ai Chi Dance 
*T'ai Chi Stick
*T'ai Chi Sword

The International Wu Shu Association teach:
*Feng Shou 	—	(‘Hand of the Wind' Kung fu, very soft, very gentle, and very fast, and suitable for women and men of all ages &lt;ref&gt;Taoist Ways of Healing by Chee Soo pages 139–140 (published by HarperCollins 1986)&lt;/ref&gt;).
*Chi Shu		—	(A form of self defence with throws &amp; breakfalls similar to [[Aikido]], which Chee Soo studied after World War 2 )
*Tao Shu (Sword)
*Kan Shu (Stick/Spear)&lt;ref&gt;Taoist Ways of Healing by Chee Soo pages 139–140 (published by HarperCollins 1986)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chee avengers.jpg|thumb|Chee Soo, Diana Rigg and Film Stunt arranger Ray Austin worked together on "The Avengers" cult TV series]]
Chee Soo was also involved as a fight choreographer with the cult TV series [[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]] during the 1960s as is evidenced by publicity photographs of him with [[Ray Austin (director)|Ray Austin]] (himself a Black Belt third dan Kung Fu Master and pupil of Soo's) and [[Diana Rigg]] probably taken around 1967. He brought Kung Fu before a western audience years before Bruce Lee had even been heard of.&lt;br /&gt;
The [[Guinness world record]] site states that "In 1965, Dame Diana Rigg (UK) became the first western actress to perform kung fu on Television when the combat choreographers Ray Austin (UK) and Chee Soo (UK/China) worked elements of the martial art into her fight scenes on The Avengers. Certificate presentation was done on [[The New Paul O'Grady Show]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-6000/first-western-actress-to-perform-kung-fu-on-television/ |title=First western actress to perform kung fu on television |publisher=Guinness World Records |date=1 May 2008 |accessdate=27 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s he ran a Chinese Health and Herbal clinic in London.&lt;ref&gt;Chinese Art of T'ai Chi Ch'uan – Gordon and Cremonesi 1976 page 1&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a British [[Movietone News]] documentary filmed on 21 May 1970 at Guildford in Surrey – UK, Chee Soo had over 2000 students studying [[Wushu (term)|Wu Shu]] in Britain as part of the British Wu Shu Association, and was one of only three men outside of Beijing qualified to teach Wu Shu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.movietone.com/N_search.cfm?ActionFlag=back2ResultsView&amp;start=1&amp;pageStart=1&amp;totalRecords=1&amp;V_DateType=1&amp;V_DECADE=1929&amp;V_FromYear=1928&amp;V_QualifySubject=&amp;V_storyNumber=95962&amp;V_TermsToOmit=&amp;V_ToYear=1980&amp;V_searchType=1&amp;V_MainSubject=&amp;V_Year=1928&amp;V_resultsPerPage=10 | title=Chinese Martial Arts | publisher=movietone.com | id=Story number: 95962 | date=21 May 1970 | accessdate=23 March 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928101121/http://www.movietone.com/N_search.cfm?ActionFlag=back2ResultsView&amp;start=1&amp;pageStart=1&amp;totalRecords=1&amp;V_DateType=1&amp;V_DECADE=1929&amp;V_FromYear=1928&amp;V_QualifySubject=&amp;V_storyNumber=95962&amp;V_TermsToOmit=&amp;V_ToYear=1980&amp;V_searchType=1&amp;V_MainSubject=&amp;V_Year=1928&amp;V_resultsPerPage=10 | archivedate=28 September 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chee Soo appeared in a [[BBC]] [[Nationwide (TV programme)|Nationwide]] TV interview on 21 September 1973 where he demonstrated Kung fu self-defence techniques and inner power live in the studio with presenter [[Bob Wellings]]. Chee Soo talked about the history of Kung Fu and the difference between Northern and Southern kung fu styles in China and how it differs from Karate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seahorsearts.co.uk/images/history/BBC%20TV%20interview%20Nationwide%201973.PNG |format=PNG |title=Nationwide |publisher=Seahorses.co.uk |accessdate=27 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975 Chee Soo was filmed by the BBC at his Feng shou kung fu class in Seymour Hall in London and subsequently appeared in a documentary broadcast for schools entitled '''Scene:Looking for a fight'''. His soft style kung fu self-defence class was contrasted with boxing and hard style kung fu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seahorsearts.co.uk/images/history/BBC%20TV%20Looking%20for%20a%20fight%201975.PNG |format=PNG |title=Scene Looking for a Fight |publisher=Seahorses.co.uk |accessdate=27 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977 he was interviewed by [[Brian Hayes (broadcaster)|Brian Hayes]] on [[LBC]] radio and talked about Lee style T'ai Chi Ch'uan, meeting his teacher Chan Kam Lee and [[Reincarnation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bufvc.ac.uk/tvandradio/lbc/index.php/segment/0010200177004 |title=Clifford Chee talks to Brian Hayes · British Universities Film &amp; Video Council |website=Bufvc.ac.uk |accessdate=27 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writings===
According to an interview with Marilyn Soo who is Chee Soo's widow, during the 1980s he moved to Coventry and spent his time writing and teaching courses in Lee-style t'ai chi ch'uan and Feng Shou Kung Fu at the Alderman Callow School in Coventry (now called [[The Westwood Academy]]) and other locations around Britain, as well as visiting some of his students overseas in places like Australia and around Europe. Chee Soo was the author of five books published during his lifetime and one book published posthumously about Taoist philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Tao of My Thoughts pages 127–150&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in Ebbw Vale on 29 August 1994 as a result of an [[Abdominal aortic aneurysm|abdominal aneurism]] caused by [[Deep vein thrombosis]] probably aggravated by several [[Deep vein thrombosis#Travelers|long haul plane flights]] during the previous two years.&lt;ref&gt;Tao of My Thoughts page 147&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3641">'''Chemism''' refers to forces of attraction or adhesion between entities.  It has uses in chemistry and philosophy.

==Chemistry==
In the past, chemism referred to intramolecular forces between atoms, or more generally, any forces acting on atoms and molecules.&lt;ref&gt;''The principles of theoretical chemistry, with special reference to the constitution of chemical compounds'' (1887).  Remsen, Ira,, Philadelphia, Lea Brothers &amp; Co. pg, 83 (archived version [https://archive.org/details/cu31924002984676 here])&lt;/ref&gt;  It is now typically superseded by more precise terms such as [[hydrogen bond|hydrogen interaction]].

==Philosophy==
The concept of chemism has been referred to in many of the various disciplines that constitute philosophical practice. Some of the include:

*The use of the term in philosophy references the activities of chemism in chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, Clark.  ''Hegel's logic: between dialectic and history'', Northwestern University Press, Chicago. 1996. (p. 260)&lt;/ref&gt;
*Chemism is a term in [[Hegelianism|Hegelian philosophy]] that stands for the ''"mutual attraction, interpenetration, and neutralisation of independent individuals which unite to form a whole."'' Hegel posits that the concept of "Objectivity" contains the "three forms of Mechanism, Chemism , and Teleology":

&lt;blockquote&gt;''"The object of mechanical type is the immediate and undifferentiated object. No doubt it contains difference, but the different pieces stand, as it were, without affinity to each other, and their connection is only extraneous. In chemism, on the contrary, the object exhibits an essential tendency to differentiation, in such a way that the objects are what they are only by their relation to each other: this tendency to difference constitutes their quality. The third type of objectivity, the teleological relation, is the unity of mechanism and chemism. Design, like the mechanical object, is a self-contained totality, enriched however by the principle of differentiation which came to the fore in chemism, and thus referring itself to the object that stands over against it. Finally, it is the realisation of design which forms the transition to the Idea."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kern-ep.de/Internet/Hegels_Logik/object.htm|title=Hegel, The Notion, Part B. The Object|first=|last=Hegel|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*In his ''Science of Logic'', [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]  develops a succession of different forms of mechanism, which end up engendering a process called "chemism". Chemism is obviously a term that lends itself to chemical relationships in physical reality. Hegel, however, is using the term "chemism" logically, and therefore it can be applied to things that you do not study in chemistry class but you might study in German literature, reading Goethe's ''Elective Affinities,'' or in psychological studies dealing with a chemistry between individuals:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''"Chemism constitutes in objectivity as a whole, the moment of judgment, of the difference that has become objective, and of the process. Since it already begins with determinateness and positedness and the chemical object is at the same time an objective totality, its immediate course is simple and is completely determined by its presupposition."''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2591">{{Merge to |Moral courage |discuss=Talk:Moral courage#Proposed merge of Civil courage into Moral courage |date=March 2018}}
'''Civil courage''' is a type of courage, related closely to heroism, in which a person acts [[bravery|bravely]] to intervene in a social situation.

==Overview==
Italian journalist and writer {{ill|Franca Magnani|de}} (1925-1996) wrote, "Je mehr Bürger mit Zivilcourage ein Land hat, desto weniger Helden wird es einmal brauchen" ("The more citizens with civil courage which a country has, the fewer heroes it needs").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psychologie.uzh.ch/de/bereiche/sob/motivation/zivilcourage/zivilcourage.html |title=Über Zivilcourage |language=German |website=[[University of Zurich]] |accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Civil Courage today ==

Civil courage has been referred to by [[psychologist]] Tobias Greitemeyer as constituting acts of [[bravery]], carried out with the objective of enforcing a societal or ethical standard, without concern for the effect these acts might have on one’s own position. In this way it is distinguished from [[alturism|altruistic]] behavior and other forms of courage. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Greitemeyer|first1=Tobias|title=Civil courage: Implicit theories, related concepts, and measurement|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17439760701228789?needAccess=true#aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGFuZGZvbmxpbmUuY29tL2RvaS9wZGYvMTAuMTA4MC8xNzQzOTc2MDcwMTIyODc4OT9uZWVkQWNjZXNzPXRydWVAQEAw|website=Tandfonline.com|publisher=The Journal of Positive Psychology|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of altruistic, helping behavior, an individual might expect to be praised or receive positive social consequences from the result of their having helped, despite possible financial or material loss. In actions where civil courage is demonstrated, the person carrying out the action may experience negative social consequences such as alienation, verbal abuse or violence. Civil courage is displayed when a person, in spite of the perceived threat of negative consequences acts to intervene in a social context. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Osswald|first1=Silvia|title=What Is Moral Courage? Definition, Explication, and Classification of a Complex Construct|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2557/541097a464168d2fbadae632288150fdf2de.pdf|website=Semanticsscholar.org|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="844">A '''closed concept''' is a concept where all the [[necessary and sufficient conditions]] required to include something within the concept can be listed. For example, the concept of a [[triangle]] is closed because a three-sided polygon, and only a three-sided polygon, is a triangle. All the conditions required to call something a triangle can be, and are, listed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3139">The '''Earth immune system''' is a controversial proposal, claimed to be a consequence of  the [[Gaia hypothesis]]. The Gaia hypothesis holds that the entire earth may be considered a single organism (Gaia). As a self-maintaining organism, Earth would have an [[immune system]] of some sort in order to maintain its health.

Some proponents of this speculative concept, for example, hold that [[human|humankind]] can be considered an "[[infection]]" of Gaia, and that [[AIDS]] is an attempt by this immune system to reject the infection. 
"[[Cancer]]" might be a more accurate term, as humans [[evolution|evolved]] within Gaia, and are not external invaders.
An opposite view is that humankind is Gaia's immune system itself, perhaps evolved to avert future catastrophes such as the [[Permian-Triassic extinction event|Permian]] and [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event|Cretaceous]] [[mass extinction]]s of species.

[[James Lovelock]]'s book "[[The Revenge of Gaia]]" suggests that Gaia has many mechanisms for eliminating [[civilization]]s that do harm through [[greenhouse gas emission]]s and [[global warming]], but suggests that with increasing heat being received from the sun, Gaia's ability to "bounce back" as it did after the [[Permian]] and [[Cretaceous]] [[extinction]] events, may be increasingly compromised.

[[Paul Hawken]] suggests in ''[[Blessed Unrest]]'' that when Earth is considered a living system then Earth's immune system is made up of the million or so organizations all around the globe that are working for social justice, the environment, and indigenous people's rights. Many of these groups are linked through the Internet and other means so there is a vast network of interconnected people and groups working to protect the planet, its people, and all beings. For example, one organization that serves to link groups working on sustainable energy is Inforse in Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.inforse.org/ |title=International Network for Sustainable Energy |work=INFORSE |year=2015 |accessdate=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Entention''' is a [[neologism]] coined by [[biological anthropology|biological anthropologist]] [[Terrence Deacon]] in his 2011 book [[Incomplete Nature]].&lt;ref&gt;* ''Incomplete Nature: How Mind Emerged from Matter.''  New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company. 2011. {{ISBN|978-0-393-04991-6}} &lt;/ref&gt; The term is deliberately similar to the term [[intention]], which has a long history of use in [[philosophy of mind]], but was designed to have a broader scope. "Ententional" is an [[adjective]] that applies to the class of objects and phenomena that refer to or are in some other way "[[aboutness|about]]" something not present. This [[wikipedia]] page is ententional because it refers to and is explicitly about an abstract concept which is not physically present in the page itself. Other paradigm examples of ententional objects are [[books]], [[DNA]] strands, and [[tools]]. In contrast, [[rocks]], [[stars]], and [[electromagnetic radiation]] are not ententional.

[[Jeremy Sherman]] writes on ententionality, "Deacon coins the term "ententional," to encompass the entire range of phenomena that must be explained, everything from the first evolvable function, to human social processes, everything traditionally called intentional but also everything merely functional, fitting and therefore representing its environment with normative (good or bad fit) consequences."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/ambigamy/201111/scientific-explanation-the-emergence-mattering-matter&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''eternal feminine''' is a psychological [[archetype]] or philosophical principle that idealizes an immutable concept of "woman". It is one component of [[gender essentialism]], the belief that men and women have different core "essences" that cannot be altered by time or environment.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Abraham, "Justice as the Mark of Catholic Feminist Ecclesiology," in ''Frontiers in Catholic Feminist Theology: Shoulder to Shoulder'' (Fortress Press, 2009), p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt; The conceptual ideal was particularly vivid in the 19th century, when women were often depicted as angelic, responsible for drawing men upward on a moral and spiritual path.&lt;ref&gt;Frances Nesbitt Oppel, ''Nietzsche On Gender: Beyond Man And Woman'', pp. 6–7, 16–17, 22 ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; Among those virtues variously regarded as essentially feminine are "modesty, gracefulness, purity, delicacy, civility, compliancy, reticence, chastity, affability, [and] politeness".&lt;ref&gt;Sandra M. Gilbert and Susan Gubar, ''The Madwoman in the Attic: The Woman Writer and the Nineteenth-Century Literary Imagination'' (Yale University Press, 2nd ed. 2000, originally published 1979), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of the "eternal feminine" ({{lang-de|das Ewig-Weibliche}}) was particularly important to [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], who introduces it at the end of ''[[Faust (Goethe)|Faust]]'', Part 2.&lt;ref&gt;Oppel, ''Nietzsche On Gender'', p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; For Goethe, "woman" symbolized pure contemplation, in contrast to masculine action, parallel to the eastern Daoist descriptions of Yin and Yang.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert and Gubar, ''The Madwoman in the Attic,'' p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; The feminine principle is further articulated by [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] within a continuity of life and death, based in large part on his readings of [[ancient Greek literature]], since in Greek culture both childbirth and the care of the dead were managed by women.&lt;ref&gt;Oppel, ''Nietzsche On Gender'', p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; [[wikt:domesticity|Domesticity]], and the power to redeem and serve as moral guardian, were also components of the "eternal feminine".&lt;ref&gt;Oppel, ''Nietzsche On Gender'', p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The virtues of women were inherently private, while those of men were public.&lt;ref&gt;Oppel, ''Nietzsche On Gender'', p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2913">'''General intellect''', according to [[Karl Marx]] in his ''[[Grundrisse]]'', became a crucial  [[productive forces|force of production]]. It is a combination of [[technological]] [[expertise]] and [[social]] [[intellect]], or general [[social knowledge]] (increasing importance of [[machine]]ry in [[social organization]]).

==Overview==
{{Quote|text="Nature builds no machines, no locomotives, railways, electric telegraphs, self-acting mules etc. These are products of human industry; natural material transformed into organs of the human will over nature, or of human participation in nature. They are organs of the human brain, created by the human hand; the power of knowledge, objectified. The development of [[fixed capital]] indicates to what degree general [[social knowledge]] has become a direct [[productive forces|force of production]], and to what degree, hence, the conditions of the process of [[Social relation|social life]] itself have come under the control of the ''general intellect'' and been transformed in accordance with it; to what degree the powers of [[social production]] have been produced, not only in the form of knowledge, but also as immediate organs of social practice, of the real life process."|sign=[[Karl Marx]]|source=''The Grundrisse'', 1858.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1857/grundrisse/ch14.htm The Grundrisse.'' Notebook VII. Fixed capital and [[circulating capital]] as two particular kinds of capital. Fixed capital and continuity of the [[production process]]. – Machinery and living labour. (Business of inventing)]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Marx, the development of the general intellect manifests in a [[capitalist society]], in the control of the social life process. In other words, with the idea of the general intellect, Marx designates a radical change of the subsumption of [[Labor force|labour]] to [[Capital (economics)|capital]] and indicates a third stage of the [[division of labour]].&lt;ref&gt;Carlo Vercellone.

:''Not to be confused with [[wikt:iustitia|iustitia]], the Latin word for "justice,"  [[Justitia]], the allegorical figure representing justice, or [[Justinian]], the byzantine emperor during the era of ancient Rome.''
'''''Justitium''''' is a [[concept]] of [[Roman law]], equivalent to the declaration of the [[state of emergency]]. It involved the suspension of civil business, typically including the courts, the treasury and the senate.  It was usually declared following a [[Monarch|sovereign]]'s death, during the troubled period of ''[[interregnum]]'', but also in case of invasions. However, in this last case, it was not as much the physical danger of invasion that justified the instauration of a state of exception, as the consequences that the news of the invasion had in [[Rome]] - for example, ''justitium'' was proclaimed at the news of [[Hannibal]]'s attacks.  The earliest recorded occasion of Justitium being invoked was for the same reason, when in 465 BC panic gripped the city due to a mistaken belief of imminent invasion by the [[Aequi]]. 

According to [[Giorgio Agamben]], ''justitium'' progressively came to mean, after the [[Roman Republic]], the public mourning of the sovereign: a sort of privatization or diversion of the danger threatening the ''[[polis]]'', as the sovereign claimed for himself the ''[[auctoritas]]'', or authority, necessary to the rule of law.

{{Immanuel Kant}}

'''Kantianism''' is the philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant]], a [[Germans|German]] philosopher born in [[Königsberg]], [[Prussia]] (now [[Kaliningrad]], [[Russia]]). The term "Kantianism" or "Kantian" is sometimes also used to describe contemporary positions in [[philosophy of mind]], [[epistemology]], and [[ethics]].

== Ethics ==
{{Main|Kantian ethics}}
[[Kantian ethics]] are [[deontological]], revolving entirely around duty rather than emotions or end goals. All actions are performed in accordance with some underlying [[Maxim (philosophy)|maxim]] or principle, which are vastly different from each other; it is according to this that the moral worth of any action is judged. Kant's ethics are founded on his view of rationality as the ultimate good and his belief that all people are fundamentally rational beings. This led to the most important part of Kant's ethics, the formulation of the [[categorical imperative]], which is the criterion for whether a maxim is good or bad.

Simply put, this criterion amounts to a [[thought experiment]]: to attempt to universalize the maxim (by imagining a world where all people necessarily acted in this way in the relevant circumstances) and then see if the maxim and its associated action would still be conceivable in such a world. For instance, holding the maxim ''kill anyone who annoys you'' and applying it universally would result in a world which would soon be devoid of people and without anyone left to kill. Thus holding this maxim is irrational as it ends up being impossible to hold it.

Universalizing a maxim (statement) leads to it being valid, or to one of two contradictions — a contradiction in conception (where the maxim, when universalized, is no longer a viable means to the end) or a contradiction in will (where the will of a person contradicts what the universalization of the maxim implies). The first type leads to      a "perfect duty", and the second leads to an "imperfect duty."

Kant's ethics focus then only on the maxim that underlies actions and judges these to be good or bad solely on how they conform to reason. Kant showed that many of our common sense views of what is good or bad conform to his system but denied that any action performed for reasons other than rational actions can be good (saving someone who is drowning simply out of a great pity for them is not a morally good act). Kant also denied that the consequences of an act in any way contribute to the moral worth of that act, his reasoning being (highly simplified for brevity) that the physical world is outside our full control and thus we cannot be held accountable for the events that occur in it.

The Formulations of the [[Categorical Imperative]]:

# Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kant|first=Immanuel|authorlink=Immanuel Kant |translator=James W. Ellington |title=Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morals |edition=3rd |publisher=Hackett|year=1993|page=30|isbn=0-87220-166-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never merely as a means to an end, but always at the same time as an end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kant|first=Immanuel|authorlink=Immanuel Kant |translator=James W. Ellington |title=Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morals |edition=3rd |publisher=Hackett|year=1993|page=36|isbn=0-87220-166-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Therefore, every rational being must so act as if he were through his maxim always a legislating member in the universal kingdom of ends.&lt;ref name="Ellington"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kant|first=Immanuel|authorlink=Immanuel Kant |translator=James W. Ellington |title=Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morals |edition=3rd |publisher=Hackett|year=1993|page=43|isbn=0-87220-166-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political philosophy==
In [[political philosophy]], Kant has had wide and increasing influence with major political philosophers of the late twentieth century. For example,  [[John Rawls]] {{citation needed|date=November 2015}} drew heavily on his inspiration in setting out the basis for a [[Liberalism|liberal]] view of political institutions.{{clarify | date = November 2015 | reason = | What inspiration? What is Rawls's view? What is Kant's view? How are the two views reconciled in Liberal thought? }} The nature of Rawls' use of Kant has engendered serious controversy  {{ clarify | date = November 2015 | reason = | What nature? What controversy? |}} but has demonstrated the vitality of Kantian considerations across a wider range of questions than was once thought plausible.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7029">'''Krausism''' is a [[doctrine]] named after the German philosopher [[Karl Christian Friedrich Krause]] (1781–1832) that advocates doctrinal [[toleration|tolerance]] and [[academic freedom]] from [[dogma]].  

This philosophy was widespread in [[Restoration (Spain)|Restoration Spain]], where it reached its maximum practical development thanks to the work of his promotor, [[Julián Sanz del Rio]], and the [[Institución Libre de Enseñanza|Free Institution of Education]] led by [[Francisco Giner de los Ríos]], and the contribution of a great jurist [[Federico Castro]]. 

One of the [[philosophers of identity]], Krause endeavoured to reconcile the ideas of a [[monotheistic]] singular [[God]] understood by [[faith]] with a [[pantheistic]] or [[empirical]] understanding of the world.

[[Divinity]], which is [[Intuition (Mind)|intuitively]] known by [[conscience]] is not a personality (which implies limitations), but an all-inclusive essence (''Wesen''), which contains the [[universe]] within itself. 

This system he called [[panentheism]], a combination of [[monotheism]] and [[pantheism]]. His theory of the world and of humanity is universal and idealistic.

==Spanish Krausism==
Spanish Krausism was a cultural movement that was rooted in the publication in the 19th century of Krause's personal version the dominant idealism, which was largely overshadowed in his native [[Germany]] by the prestige of its leading figures: [[Fichte]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]] and especially [[Hegel]]. 

Around 1840, a group of Spanish [[jurist]]s, notably Julián Sanz del Río were seeking a political doctrine within the [[liberalism|liberal]] tradition to initiate a regenerative process that they felt was necessary to modify and extend the philosophical concepts then in vogue. 

Coincidentally, [[Ruperto Navarro Zamorano]], a member of the Friends of Sanz del Rio, had in 1841 translated the '' Course Natural Law, or Philosophy of Law '', by [[Heinrich Ahrens]], which had previously been published in Paris in 1837.

Ahrens affirmed that the foundation of law is the "compliance": the set of external conditions upon which the fate of the rational [[Homo sapiens| man]] and [[human nature|humanity]] could be developed systematically as a universal order of piety, [[Roman Catholic devotions|devotion]] and [[altruism]]. 

Ahrens philosophy was developed and summarized by Kraus in the formula of "harmonious rationalism" or "[[panentheism]]" published in 1811 as  ''The Ideal of Humanity and Universal Federation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Ideal of Humanity and Universal Federation

Clark (Edinburgh)|date=1900|editor=W. Hastie D.D.|accessdate=2014-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Latin American Krausism==
The common language made some Latin Americans who visited or were exiled to Spain come into contact with Krause's doctrines. The most outstanding case was that of a Puerto Rican [[Eugenio María de Hostos]], who studied philosophy with Sanz del Rio. 

De Hostos' novel ''The Inner Pilgrimage of Eugenio Mara de Hostos as Seen Through Bayón''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Inner Pilgrimage of Eugenio Mara de Hostos as Seen Through Bayón|author=Eugenio Maria de Hostas|publisher=Centro Pro Hostos de Nueva York|date=2006-11-01|editor=de Hildreth N Waltzer}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a romantic novel in the form of a diary outlining his dream of a unified social philosophy. Hostos supports the liberation of women not as a human right, rather as a practical mechanism for greater good for the community and for the social organization. 

The Cuban writer and national hero [[José Martí]],  suffered a brutal political imprisonment with forced labor, but, despite his youth, he escaped prison for exile in Spain.  There he write letters against transatlantic military brutality of the colonial regime. He also studied law and thus encountered the philosophy and doctrines of Krause.

These two proponents,  Martí and de Hostos, although with a very different personal discourses, greatly influenced the evolution of Krausism in which the individual takes personal responsibility to act for the betterment of society. These discourses led to the so-called "Anti-Imperialist-Nationalism". This t term was first developed by Dr. [[Rafael Cuevas]], and referred to the analysis of the rebellion of Augusto C. Sandino, then fighting against the [[United States occupation of Nicaragua]]. 

Hostos and Martí became heroes and allies in their anti-colonial struggle for independence for both [[Spanish–American War|Cuba]] and [[Spanish–American War|Puerto Rico]] from Spain. Both men were initiated into [[Freemasonry]], thus confirming the influence of Freemasonry in the promotion of Krausism and vice versa. These links promoted a kind of social network to support the migration of Krausists liberal educators who reached out to Latin Americas'  liberal leaders who were seeking autonomy from colonial Spain.

Later Krausism figures included [[Hipólito Yrigoyen]], [[José Batlle y Ordóñez]], [[Alfonso Reyes]], [[Jose Enrique Rodo]], [[Alejandro Deustua]], [[Arturo Umberto Illia]] and [[Alejandro Korn]]. Reyes, for example, gave lectures at the [[Residencia de Estudiantes]] in Madrid, whilst Rodo promoted esthetic concern through Krausism in his extensive correspondence with [[Leopoldo Alas]].

{{Expert-subject|Philosophy/Eastern|date=November 2008}}
'''''Li''''' （理, pinyin ''[[Standard Chinese phonology#Tones|lǐ]]''）is a concept found in [[neo-Confucian]] [[Chinese philosophy]]. 
It refers to the underlying reason and order of nature as reflected in its organic forms.

It may be translated as "rational [[principle]]" or "law." It was central to [[Zhu Xi]]'s integration of [[Buddhism]] into Confucianism. Zhu Xi held that ''li'', together with ''[[qi]]'' (氣: vital, material force), depend on each other to create structures of nature and matter. The sum of ''li'' is the ''[[Taiji (philosophy)|Taiji]]''.

This idea resembles the [[Buddhist]] notion of ''li'', which also means "principle." Zhu Xi maintained, however, that his notion is found in ''[[I Ching]]'' (''Book of Changes''), a classic source of [[Chinese philosophy]].
Zhu Xi's school came to be known as the School of ''Li'', which is comparable to [[rationalism]]. To an even greater extent than Confucius, Zhu Xi had a naturalistic world-view. His world-view contained two primary ideas: qi and li. Zhu Xi further believed that the conduct of the two of these took places according to Tai Ji.

Holding to Confucius and Mencius' conception of humanity as innately good, Zhu Xi articulated an understanding of ''li'' as the basic pattern of the universe, stating that it was understood that one couldn't live without ''li'' and live an exemplary life. In this sense, ''li'' according to Zhu Xi is often seen as similar to the [[Tao|Dao]] in [[Taoism|Daoism]] or to [[Telos (philosophy)|telos]] in [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Greek philosophy]] and also to the [[Dharma]] in [[Hinduism]] . [[Wang Yangming]], a philosopher who opposed Zhu Xi's ideas, held that ''li'' was to be found not in the world but within oneself. Wang Yangming was thus more of an [[idealist]] with a different [[epistemic]] approach.

==Sources==
The philosophical concept of ''li'' is inherently difficult to define and is easily mistranslated into various simplifications of the core idea.
Many philosophers have tried to better explain it, [[Alan Watts]] being one of the prominent 20th century authors on the subject.
{{Quotation|

The ''tao'' is a certain kind of order, and this kind of order is not quite what we call order when we arrange everything geometrically in boxes, or in rows. That is a very crude kind of order, but when you look at a plant it is perfectly obvious that the plant has order. We recognize at once that it is not a mess, but it is not symmetrical and it is not geometrical looking. The plant looks like a Chinese drawing, because they appreciated this kind of non-symmetrical order so much that it became an integral aspect of their painting. In the Chinese language this is called ''li'', and the character for ''li'' means the markings in jade. It also means the grain in wood and the fiber in muscle. We could say, too, that clouds have ''li'', marble has ''li'', the human body has ''li''. We all recognize it, and the artist copies it whether he is a landscape painter, a portrait painter, an abstract painter, or a non-objective painter. They all are trying to express the essence of ''li''. The interesting thing is, that although we all know what it is, there is no way of defining it. Because ''tao'' is the course, we can also call ''li'' the watercourse, and the patterns of ''li'' are also the patterns of flowing water. We see those patterns of flow memorialized, as it were, as sculpture in the grain in wood, which is the flow of sap, in marble, in bones, in muscles. All these things are patterned according to the basic principles of flow. In the patterns of flowing water you will find all kind of motifs from Chinese art, immediately recognizable, including the S-curve in the circle of yang-yin{{sic}}.

So ''li'' means then the order of flow, the wonderful dancing pattern of liquid, because Lao-tzu likens ''tao'' to water:

The great ''tao'' flows everywhere, to the left and to the right, 
It loves and nourishes all things, but does not lord it over them.

The '''Oxford Franciscan school''' was the name given to a group of [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] philosophers that, in the context of the [[Renaissance of the 12th century]], gave special contribution to the development of [[science]] and [[scientific method]]ology during the [[High Middle Ages]]. This group includes such names as [[Robert Grosseteste]], [[Roger Bacon]], [[Duns Scotus]] and [[William of Ockham]] as well as [[Thomas of York (Franciscan)|Thomas of York]], [[John Peckham]], and [[Richard of Middleton]].

[[Robert Grosseteste]], was the founder of the [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] [[Franciscan]] school. He was the first scholastic philosophers to fully understand [[Aristotle|Aristotle's]] vision of the dual path of [[scientific reasoning]]. Concluding from particular observations into a universal law, and then back again: from universal laws to prediction of particulars. Grosseteste called this "resolution and composition". Further, Grosseteste said that both paths should be verified through experimentation in order to verify the principles. These ideas established a tradition that carried forward to [[Padua]] and [[Galileo Galilei]] in the 17th century.

Under the tuition of Grosseteste and inspired by the writings of [[Arab]] [[alchemy|alchemists]] who had preserved and built upon [[Aristotle]]'s portrait of [[Induction (philosophy)|induction]], Bacon described a repeating cycle of ''observation'', ''hypothesis'', ''experimentation'', and the need for independent ''verification''. He recorded the manner in which he conducted his experiments in precise detail so that others could reproduce and independently test his results — a cornerstone of the [[scientific method]], and a continuation of the work of researchers like [[Al Battani|Albatenius]].

A '''paradox''' is a statement that, despite apparently valid reasoning from true premises, leads to an apparently-self-contradictory or logically unacceptable conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=paradox|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/paradox|website=Oxford Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=21 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bolander|first1=Thomas|title=Self-Reference|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/self-reference/|accessdate=21 June 2016|publisher=The Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A paradox involves contradictory-yet-interrelated elements that exist simultaneously and persist over time.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, W. K. and Lewis, M. W. (2011). Toward a theory of paradox: A dynamic equilibrium model of organizing. ''Academy of Management Review,'' 36, pp. 381-403&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, Y., Waldman, D. A., Han, Y., and Li, X. (2015). Paradoxical leader behaviors in people management: Antecedents and consequences. ''Academy of Management Journal,'' 58, pp. 538-566&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David A. Waldman and    David E. Bowen (2016), Learning to Be a Paradox-Savvy Leader, ''Academy of Management -- Perspectives,'' vol. 30, no. 3, 316-327, {{doi|10.5465/amp.2015.0070}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some logical paradoxes are known to be [[Validity (logic)|invalid]] arguments but are still valuable in promoting [[critical thinking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Eliason |first=James L. |url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/9604072434/using-paradoxes-teach-critical-thinking-science |title=Using Paradoxes to Teach Critical Thinking in Science |journal=Journal of College Science Teaching |volume=15 |issue=5 |pages=341–44 |date=March–April 1996 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some paradoxes have revealed errors in definitions assumed to be rigorous, and have caused [[axioms]] of mathematics and logic to be re-examined. One example is [[Russell's paradox]], which questions whether a "list of all lists that do not contain themselves" would include itself, and showed that attempts to found [[set theory]] on the identification of sets with [[Property (philosophy)|properties]] or [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicates]] were flawed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Crossley | first1=J.N. | last2=Ash | first2=C.J. | last3=Brickhill | first3=C.J. | last4=Stillwell | first4=J.C. | last5=Williams | first5=N.H. | title=What is mathematical logic? | zbl=0251.02001 | location=London-Oxford-New York | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | year=1972 | isbn=0-19-888087-1 | pages=59–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others, such as [[Curry's paradox]], are not yet resolved.

Examples outside logic include the [[ship of Theseus]] from philosophy (questioning whether a ship repaired over time by replacing each and all of its wooden parts, one at a time, would remain the same ship). Paradoxes can also take the form of images or other media. For example, [[M.C. Escher]] featured [[Perspective (visual)|perspective-based]] paradoxes in many of his drawings, with walls that are regarded as floors from other points of view, and staircases that appear to climb endlessly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aminotes.tumblr.com/post/653017235/the-mathematical-art-of-m-c-escher-for-me-it |title=The Mathematical Art of M.C. Escher |website=Lapidarium notes |editor-first=Amira |editor-last=Skomorowska |accessdate=2013-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In common usage, the word "paradox" often refers to statements that may be both true and false i.e. [[irony|ironic]] or unexpected, such as "the paradox that standing is more tiring than walking".&lt;ref name="dictionary"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/paradox |title=Paradox |website=Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia |accessdate=2013-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Logical paradox==
{{See also|List of paradoxes}}
Common themes in paradoxes include [[self-reference]], [[infinite regress]], [[circular definition]]s, and confusion between different levels of [[abstraction]].

[[Patrick Hughes (artist)|Patrick Hughes]] outlines three laws of the paradox:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;Self-reference: An example is "This statement is false", a form of the [[liar paradox]]. The statement is referring to itself. Another example of self-reference is the question of whether the [[barber]] shaves himself in the [[barber paradox]]. One more example would be "Is the answer to this question 'No'?"
;Contradiction: "This statement is false"; the statement cannot be false and true at the same time. Another example of contradiction is if a man talking to a genie wishes that wishes couldn't come true.  This contradicts itself because if the genie grants his wish, he did not grant his wish, and if he refuses to grant his wish, then he did indeed grant his wish, therefore making it impossible either to grant or not grant his wish because his wish contradicts itself.
;Vicious circularity, or infinite regress: "This statement is false"; if the statement is true, then the statement is false, thereby making the statement true. Another example of [[vicious circle|vicious circularity]] is the following group of statements:
:: "The following sentence is true."
:: "The previous sentence is false."

Other paradoxes involve [[false statement]]s ("'impossible' is not a word in my vocabulary", a simple paradox) or [[half-truths]] and the resulting [[cognitive bias|biased]] assumptions.  This form is common in [[Howler (error)|howlers]].

For example, consider a situation in which a father and his son are driving down the road.  The car crashes into a tree and the father is killed.  The boy is rushed to the nearest hospital where he is prepared for emergency [[surgery]].  Upon entering the surgery-suite, the surgeon says, "I can't operate on this boy.  He's my son."

The apparent paradox is caused by a [[hasty generalization]], for if the surgeon is the boy's father, the statement cannot be true.  The paradox is resolved if it is revealed that the surgeon is a woman — the boy's mother.

Paradoxes which are not based on a hidden error generally occur at the fringes of context or [[language]], and require extending the context or language in order to lose their paradoxical quality.  Paradoxes that arise from apparently intelligible uses of language are often of interest to [[logic]]ians and [[philosopher]]s.  "This sentence is false" is an example of the well-known [[liar paradox]]: it is a sentence which cannot be consistently interpreted as either true or false, because if it is known to be false, then it is known that it must be true, and if it is known to be true, then it is known that it must be false. [[Russell's paradox]], which shows that the notion of ''the [[set (mathematics)|set]] of all those sets that do not contain themselves'' leads to a contradiction, was instrumental in the development of modern logic and set theory.

[[Thought-experiment]]s can also yield interesting paradoxes. The [[grandfather paradox]], for example, would arise if a [[time-travel]]er were to kill his own grandfather before his mother or father had been conceived, thereby preventing his own birth. This is a specific example of the more general observation of the [[butterfly effect]], or that a time-traveller's interaction with the past — however slight — would entail making changes that would, in turn, change the future in which the time-travel was yet to occur, and would thus change the circumstances of the time-travel itself.

Often a seemingly paradoxical conclusion arises from an inconsistent or inherently contradictory definition of the initial premise.  In the case of that apparent paradox of a time-traveler killing his own grandfather, it is the inconsistency of defining the past to which he returns as being somehow different from the one which leads up to the future from which he begins his trip, but also insisting that he must have come to that past from the same future as the one that it leads up to.

==Quine's classification&lt;!--Linked from 'Willard Van Orman Quine'--&gt;==
{{see also|Veridicality}}

[[W. V. Quine]] (1962) distinguished between three classes of paradoxes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Ways of Paradox, and other essays | last1 = Quine | first1 = W.V. | authorlink = W.V. Quine | year = 1966 | publisher = Random House | publication-place = New York | chapter =  The ways of paradox }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* A ''veridical paradox'' produces a result that appears absurd but is demonstrated to be true nonetheless.  Thus the paradox of Frederic's birthday in ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'' establishes the surprising fact that a twenty-one-year-old would have had only five birthdays if he had been born on a [[leap day]].  Likewise, [[Arrow's impossibility theorem]] demonstrates difficulties in mapping voting- results to the will of the people.  The [[Monty Hall paradox]] demonstrates that a decision which has an intuitive 50–50 chance is in fact heavily biased towards making a decision which, given the intuitive conclusion, the player would be unlikely to make.  In 20th-Century science, [[Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel]] and [[Schrödinger's cat]] are famously vivid examples of a theory being taken to a logical but paradoxical end.
* A ''falsidical paradox'' establishes a result that not only ''appears'' false but actually ''is'' false, due to a fallacy in the demonstration.  The various [[invalid proof|invalid mathematical proofs]] (e.g., that 1 = 2) are classic examples, generally relying on a hidden [[division by zero]]. Another example is the inductive form of the [[All horses are the same colour|horse paradox]], which falsely generalises from true specific statements.  [[Zeno's paradoxes]] are 'falsidical', concluding, for example, that a flying arrow never reaches its target or that a speedy runner cannot catch up to a tortoise with a small head-start.
* A paradox that is in neither class may be an ''[[antinomy]]'', which reaches a self-contradictory result by properly applying accepted ways of reasoning.  For example, the [[Grelling–Nelson paradox]] points out genuine problems in our understanding of the ideas of truth and description.
A fourth kind has sometimes been described since Quine's work.
* A paradox that is both true and false at the same time and in the same sense is called a ''[[dialetheia]]''.  In Western logics it is often assumed, following [[Aristotle]], that no ''dialetheia'' exist, but they are sometimes accepted in Eastern traditions (e.g. in the [[Mohists]],&lt;ref name="SchoolOfNames"&gt;The [[School of Names|Logicians]] ([[Warring States period]]),[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/school-names/paradoxes.html "Miscellaneous paradoxes"] ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Gongsun Longzi]],&lt;ref name="Graham-studies334"&gt;Graham, Angus Charles. (1990). {{google books|TD43k809CT8C|''Studies in Chinese Philosophy and Philosophical Literature,'' p. 334.|page=334}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Zen]]&lt;ref&gt;Chung-ying Cheng (1973) "[http://www.thezensite.com/ZenEssays/Philosophical/OnZenLanguage.htm On Zen (Ch’an) Language and Zen Paradoxes]" ''Journal of Chinese Philosophy'', '''V. 1''' (1973) pp. 77-102&lt;/ref&gt;) and in [[paraconsistent logic]]s.  It would be mere equivocation or a matter of degree, for example, to both affirm and deny that "John is here" when John is halfway through the door but it is self-contradictory simultaneously to affirm and deny the event.

==In philosophy==
A taste for paradox is central to the philosophies of [[Laozi]], [[Zhuang Zhou|Zhuangzi]], [[Heraclitus]], [[Bhartrhari]], [[Meister Eckhart]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], [[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], and [[G.K. Chesterton]], among many others.  Søren Kierkegaard, for example, writes in the ''[[Philosophical Fragments]]'' that
&lt;blockquote&gt;But one must not think ill of the paradox, for the paradox is the passion of thought, and the thinker without the paradox is like the lover without passion: a mediocre fellow.  But the ultimate potentiation of every passion is always to will its own downfall, and so it is also the ultimate passion of the understanding to will the collision, although in one way or another the collision must become its downfall.  This, then, is the ultimate paradox of thought: to want to discover something that thought itself cannot think.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kierkegaard |first=Søren |editor1-first=Howard V. |editor1-last=Hong |editor2-first=Edna H. |editor2-last=Hong |title=Philosophical Fragments |year=1844 |page=37 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kuMoXUAaEr0C&amp;pg=PA37 |publisher=Princeton University Press |publication-date=1985 |isbn=9780691020365}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==In medicine==
A [[paradoxical reaction]] to a [[drug]] is the opposite of what one would expect, such as becoming agitated by a [[sedative]] or sedated by a [[stimulant]]. Some are common and are used regularly in medicine, such as the use of  stimulants such as [[Adderall]] and [[Ritalin]] in the treatment of [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (also known as ADHD) while others are rare and can be dangerous as they are not expected, such as severe agitation from a [[benzodiazepine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Psychopharmacology of Agitation: Consensus Statement of the American Association for Emergency Psychiatry Project BETA Psychopharmacology Workgroup |pmc=3298219 |website=National Center for Biotechnology Information, U.S. National Library of Medicine |publisher=National Institutes of Health}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4153">[[File:Bernhardt Hamlet2.jpg|thumb| The paradox of fiction asks why we experience strong emotions when, for example,  we are watching [[Hamlet]] on stage while at the same time knowing that it is not really Hamlet but merely an [[actor]].]]

The '''paradox of fiction''' is a [[Philosophy|philosophical]] problem about how people can experience strong [[Aesthetic emotions|emotions]] from purely [[fiction]]al things, such as art, literature, and imagination. The [[paradox]] draws attention to an everyday issue of how people are moved by things which, in some ways, do not exist. Although the [[ontology]] of fictional things in general has been discussed in philosophy since [[Plato]],&lt;ref name=paskow2004&gt;{{cite book|last=Paskow|first=Alan|title=The Paradoxes of Art : A phenomenological investigation|year=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0-521-82833-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; the paradox was first suggested by [[Colin Radford]] and Michael Weston in 1975.&lt;ref name=radwest1975&gt;{{cite journal|last=Radford|first=Colin|author2=Weston, Michael|title=How can we be moved by the fate of Anna Karenina?|journal=Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society, Supplementary Volumes|date=January 1975|volume=49|pages=67–93|jstor=4106870}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Radford and Weston's original paper, they and others have continued the discussion by giving the problem slightly differing formulations and solutions.&lt;ref name="iep2012"&gt;{{cite web|last = Schneider|first = Steven|title = The Paradox of Fiction|url = http://www.iep.utm.edu/fict-par/|publisher = Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate = 27 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The paradox ==
The basic paradox is as follows:&lt;ref name="paskow2004" /&gt;

# Most people have emotional responses to characters, objects, events etc. which they know to be fictitious.
# On the other hand, in order for us to be emotionally moved, we must believe that these characters, objects, or events, truly exist.
# But no person who takes characters or events to be fictional at the same time believes that they are real.

The paradox is that all three premises seem to be true, but can not logically be true at the same time. If any two points (e.g. 1 and 3) are taken to be true, then the third (e.g. 2) must either be false or else produce a contradiction.

==Proposed solutions==
The various proposed solutions to the paradox can be divided into three basic groups:&lt;ref name="paskow2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="iep2012" /&gt;

* The ''pretend'' or the ''simulation theories'', proposed for example by [[Kendall Walton]].
:The pretend theories deny premise 1 and argue that with fiction we do not experience real emotions but rather something less intense. For example, when watching a horror movie where the monster makes an attack towards the viewer (towards the camera), the viewer can be startled but does not truly fear for his or her life.
* The ''thought theories'', for example from [[Peter Lamarque]], [[Noël Carroll]], and Robert J. Yanal.
:The thought theories deny premise 2 and claim that we can have genuine emotions from things even if we do not believe them to exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://thegemsbok.com/art-reviews-and-articles/philosophy-articles-friday-phil-colin-radford-paradox-of-fiction/|title = Why Stories Make Us Feel: Colin Radford’s So-called "Paradox of Fiction" and How Art Prompts Human Emotion|date = November 13, 2015|access-date = February 22, 2016|website = The Gemsbok|publisher = |last = Podgorski|first = Daniel|series = Your Friday Phil}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''illusion'' or ''realist theories'', for example from Alan Paskow.
:The illusion theories deny premise 3 and claim that, in a way, the fictional characters are real. They suggest that [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] was right saying that fiction involves a ''[[Suspension of disbelief|"willing suspension of disbelief"]]'', i.e. believing in the fiction while engaging with it.

==Overview==
The elements that comprise a philosophical position consist of [[statement (logic)|statements]] which are [[belief|believed]] to be [[truth|true]] by the thinkers who accept them, and which may or may not be [[empiricism|empirical]]. The sciences have a very clear idea of what a theory is; however in the arts such as philosophy, the definition is more hazy.&lt;ref name="dot"/&gt; Philosophical positions are not necessarily [[scientific theory|scientific theories]], although they may consist of both empirical and non-empirical statements.

In essence, the collective statements of all [[philosophical movement]]s, [[school of thought|schools of thought]], and [[belief system]]s consist of philosophical positions. Also included among philosophical positions are many [[principle]]s, [[hypothesis|hypotheses]], [[Norm (philosophy)|rules]], [[paradox]]es, [[law]]s, as well as 'ologies, 'isms, 'sis's, and [[List of effects|effects]].&lt;ref name="dot"/&gt;

Some examples of philosophical positions include:
* [[Metatheory]]; positions about the formation and content of theorems, such as [[Kurt Gödel]]'s [[incompleteness theorem]].
* [[Political theory]]; positions that underlie a [[political philosophy]], such as [[John Rawls]]' [[A Theory of Justice|theory of justice]].
* [[Ethical theory]] and [[meta-ethics]]; positions about the nature and purpose of [[ethical]] statements,&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard T. Garner]] and [[Bernard Rosen]], ''Moral Philosophy: A Systematic Introduction to Normative Ethics and Meta-ethics.'' (Macmillan, 1967)&lt;/ref&gt; such as the [[Kantianism#Ethics|ethical theory]] of [[Immanuel Kant]].
* [[Critical theory]]; in its narrow sense, a [[Western Europe]]an body of [[Frankfurt School]] [[Marxist]] thought that aims at criticizing and transforming, rather than merely explaining, social structures.&lt;ref&gt;See generally, [[Max Horkheimer]], ''Traditional and Critical Theory'' (1937)&lt;/ref&gt; In a broader sense, "critical theory" relates to a wide variety of political, literary, and philosophical positions that take at least some of their inspiration from the Frankfurt School and its dialectic, and that typically contest the possibility of objectivity or aloofness from political positions and privileges.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/critical-theory/ Critical theory]" at the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  

Philosophical positions may also take the form of a [[life stance]], [[religion]], [[world view]], or [[ideology]].

'''Philosophy of Eating''' is a concept of food production and nutritional philosophy that matches the source and result of health together.

The core of these points of view is to attach a mental state of mind with the sources of proper agricultural food sources in a balance of harmony in part because the sources have freshness and purity. Modern assertions are that the fresh foods contain vital [[micronutrients]] generally lost in most food processing.

Additional issues are brought to light in modern times where [[advertising]] along with subtle cues in color or related sensory inputs are masking substandard or even toxic ingredients present.  The masquerade of dyes and organic chemicals from non-food sources become key in the current vernacular of various publications and nutrition movements.

==History==
As a book [[The Philosophy of Eating]] by author [[Albert Jones Bellows|Andrew Bellows]] in the late 1860s,.&lt;ref&gt;Albert J. Bellows (1868) [https://books.google.com/books/about/Philosophy_of_Eating_1868.html?id=7Td5xyWSFb4C originated at the Harvard University Library, subsequently published by Hurd and Houghton] 1867.&lt;/ref&gt; The author portrayed the concepts in light of science as well as views drawn from religiosity common in the middle to late 1860's era.  So with a biblical fervor as an original direction of inspiration the author then supplies a variety of what was then scientific knowledge to correctly apply that in agriculture to the table in the kitchen. Fresh fruits and grains as those so ordained in the work making up a core of inputs to the meats of the day looked upon in detail most up to that time obtained from the local butcher.

More recent incarnations derived from this are exhibited in [[raw foodism]] for people. This manifestation seen in a variety of areas including [[vegan|vegan food preparation]] and offshoots related. The [[micronutrients]] [[amylase]]s, [[protease]]s, and [[lipase]]s aid digestion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.holisticjunction.com/articles/8019.html |title="Digestive Enzymes do More than just Aid Digestion", an article at Holistic Junction |publisher=Holisticjunction.com |date=2007-08-24 |accessdate=2010-05-12 }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; to a variety of shared characteristics of the origins of food spelled out in the 1860s book started to mainstream more so as a backlash to &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drweil.com/drw/u/ART02840/How-to-Eat-in-Seven-Words.html |title="How to Eat in Seven Words", an article at Dr. Andrew Weil |author=Brad Lemley|publisher=drweil.com |date=2011-01-28 |accessdate=2013-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; simplify the sourcing to consumption in thought as well a contexts for acceptability.

Contemporary revisiting of this in a new updated book continuing is a more secular scientific work by [[George Davey]] who published a 2013 book called ''Break the Trance''.  [[The Philosophy of Eating Break the Trance|Break the Trance]]
.&lt;ref&gt;George Davey (2013) [http://lccn.loc.gov/2013938024 The Library of Congress, published by Corn Publishing]  2013.&lt;/ref&gt; With more up to date scientific analysis than the treatise from [[Albert Jones Bellows|Andrew Bellows]] the author describes how mechanisms of discovery, chemical masks and the driving forces beyond that of the earlier works in the topic.

==Experiences==

Philosophy extends from the scientific observation to how we as people treat our animals versus ourselves in dietary habits from youth through to adulthood.

Reviving the lost art of nourishing ourselves &lt;ref&gt;Carrien and Tamra (2006) [http://foodthatnourishes.blogspot.com/2006/10/philosophy-of-eating.html 'Philosophy of Eating', the real food revolution]  2006&lt;/ref&gt; blogged about in part to illustrate this as a proper approach.

Though cited in [[The Philosophy of Eating Break the Trance|Break the Trance]], health philosophy of eating like our paleolithic ancestors is found in a variety directions including mineral intake.

==Contrast==

Processed foods get celebration along with trepidation in newer periodicals in 2013. Scientific American and Wired devote entire issues to food content and philosophy of nutrition.

Particularly, the scientific basis is now better understood and psychological remediation or behavior patterns are more amenable to that of a reader in modern times contrasted with processed food celebration by.&lt;ref&gt;Evelyn Kim (2013) [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=processed-food-a-two-million-year-history 'Processed Food: A 2-Million-Year History', It is the dark force, we're told, behind the obesity epidemic, the death of the family farm and Tang...]  2013&lt;/ref&gt; The continued strength of industrialized food troubles some people though.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1794">The '''Philosophy of mathematics education''' is an [[interdisciplinary]] area of study and research based on the intersection of the fields of [[mathematics education]] and the [[philosophy of mathematics]], the latter being understood in an inclusive sense to include multidisciplinary theorizing about mathematics incorporating philosophical, sociological, anthropological, semiotic, historical, ethnomathematical, etc., perspectives. 

Some of the central questions addressed by this sub-field are:
*What is mathematics?, and what accounts have philosophers and other theorists given of it?
*How does mathematics relate to society? 
*What are the aims of teaching and learning mathematics?
*What fundamental assumptions underlie the learning and teaching mathematics? 
*How do philosophies of mathematics link with mathematics teaching and learning? 
*What is the status of mathematics education as knowledge field?

For further details see 'What is the philosophy of mathematics education?' by [[Paul Ernest]].

There is a dedicated ''[[Philosophy of Mathematics Education Journal]]'' freely available on the web.

The '''problem of evil''' refers to the question of how to reconcile the existence of [[evil]] with an [[Omnipotence|omnipotent]], [[Omnibenevolence|omnibenevolent]] and [[Omniscience|omniscient]] [[God]] (see [[theism]]).&lt;ref name="Stanford"&gt;The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, "[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/evil The Problem of Evil]", Michael Tooley&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IepEvidential"&gt;The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, "[http://www.iep.utm.edu/e/evil-evi.htm The Evidential Problem of Evil]", Nick Trakakis&lt;/ref&gt; An '''argument from evil''' claims that because evil exists, either God does not exist or does not have all three of those properties. Attempts to show the contrary have traditionally been discussed under the heading of [[theodicy]]. Besides philosophy of religion, the problem of evil is also important to the field of [[theology]] and [[ethics]].

The problem of evil is often formulated in two forms: the logical problem of evil and the evidential problem of evil. The logical form of the argument tries to show a logical impossibility in the coexistence of God and evil,&lt;ref name="Stanford" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IepLogical"/&gt; while the evidential form tries to show that given the evil in the world, it is improbable that there is an omnipotent, omniscient, and wholly good God.&lt;ref name="IepEvidential" /&gt; The problem of evil has been extended to non-human life forms, to include animal suffering from natural evils and human [[animal cruelty|cruelty]] against them.&lt;ref name=inwagenp120/&gt;

Responses to various versions of the problem of evil, meanwhile, come in three forms: refutations, defenses, and theodicies. A wide range of responses have been made against these arguments. There are also many discussions of evil and associated problems in other philosophical fields, such as [[secular ethics]],&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas J. Rengger, ''Moral Evil and International Relations'', in ''[[SAIS Review]]'' 25:1, Winter/Spring 2005, pp. 3–16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Kivy, ''Melville's Billy and the Secular Problem of Evil: the Worm in the Bud'', in ''[[The Monist]]'' (1980), 63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kekes |first=John |authorlink=John Kekes |title=Facing Evil |publisher=Princeton UP |year=1990 |location=Princeton |url= |id= |isbn=0-691-07370-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[evolutionary ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Anders, ''The Evolution of Evil'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lawrence C.

The problem of evil acutely applies to monotheistic religions such as [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], and [[Judaism]] that believe in a monotheistic God who is omnipotent, omniscient and omnibenevolent;&lt;ref&gt;[http://public.wsu.edu/~brians/hum_303/evil.html Problem of Evil], Paul Brians, Washington State University&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen D.

The problem of evil refers to the challenge of reconciling belief in an omniscient, omnipotent, and omnibenevolent God, with the existence of evil and suffering in the world.&lt;ref name="IepEvidential" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Harvey2013p141"/&gt;&lt;ref name=boydp56&gt;Gregory A.

===Logical problem of evil&lt;!--'Logical problem of evil' redirects here--&gt;===
Originating with Greek philosopher [[Epicurus]],&lt;ref&gt;The formulation may have been wrongly attributed to Epicurus by Lactantius, who, from his Christian perspective, regarded Epicurus as an [[atheist]]. According to Mark Joseph Larrimore, (2001), ''The Problem of Evil'', pp. xix–xxi. Wiley-Blackwell. According to [[Reinhold F. Glei]], it is settled that the argument of theodicy is from an academical source which is not only not epicurean, but even anti-epicurean. Reinhold F. Glei, ''Et invidus et inbecillus. Das angebliche Epikurfragment bei Laktanz, De ira dei 13, 20–21'', in: ''Vigiliae Christianae'' 42 (1988), pp. 47–58&lt;/ref&gt; the '''logical argument from evil'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is as follows:

# If an [[omnipotent]], [[omnibenevolent]] and [[omniscient]] god exists, then evil does not.
# There is evil in the world.
# Therefore, an omnipotent, omnibenevolent and omniscient god does not exist.

This argument is of the form [[modus tollens]], and is [[logically valid]]: If its premises are true, the conclusion follows of necessity.  To show that the first premise is plausible, subsequent versions tend to expand on it, such as this modern example:&lt;ref name="IepEvidential" /&gt;
# God exists.
# God is omnipotent, omnibenevolent and omniscient.
# An omnipotent being has the power to prevent that evil from coming into existence.
# An omnibenevolent being would want to prevent all evils.
# An omniscient being knows every way in which evils can come into existence, and knows every way in which those evils could be prevented.
# A being who knows every way in which an evil can come into existence, who is able to prevent that evil from coming into existence, and who wants to do so, would prevent the existence of that evil.
# If there exists an omnipotent, omnibenevolent and omniscient God, then no evil exists.
# Evil exists (logical contradiction).

Both of these arguments are understood to be presenting two forms of the ''logical'' problem of evil. They attempt to show that the assumed [[proposition]]s lead to a [[logical]] [[contradiction]] and therefore cannot all be correct. Most philosophical debate has focused on the propositions stating that God cannot exist with, or would want to prevent, all evils (premises 3 and 6), with defenders of theism (for example, Leibniz) arguing that God could very well exist with and allow evil in order to achieve a greater good.

If God lacks any one of these qualities—omniscience, omnipotence, or omnibenevolence—then the logical problem of evil can be resolved. [[Process theology]] and [[open theism]] are other positions that limit God's omnipotence and/or omniscience (as defined in traditional theology). [[Dystheism]] is the belief that God is not wholly good.

===Evidential problem of evil&lt;!--'Logical problem of evil' and 'Evidential argument from evil' redirect here--&gt;===
[[File:Deerfire high res edit.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[William L. Rowe]]'s example of [[natural evil]]: "In some distant forest lightning strikes a dead tree, resulting in a forest fire. In the fire a fawn is trapped, horribly burned, and lies in terrible agony for several days before death relieves its suffering."&lt;ref name=rowe336&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rowe|first=William L.|authorlink=William L.

The '''evidential problem of evil'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (also referred to as the probabilistic or inductive version of the problem) seeks to show that the existence of evil, although logically consistent with the existence of God, counts against or lowers the [[probability]] of the truth of theism. As an example, a critic of Plantinga's idea of "a mighty nonhuman spirit" causing natural evils may concede that the existence of such a being is not logically impossible but argue that due to lacking scientific evidence for its existence this is very unlikely and thus it is an unconvincing explanation for the presence of natural evils. Both absolute versions and relative versions of the evidential problems of evil are presented below.

A version by [[William L. Rowe]]:
# There exist instances of intense suffering which an omnipotent, omniscient being could have prevented without thereby losing some greater good or permitting some evil equally bad or worse.
# An omniscient, wholly good being would prevent the occurrence of any intense suffering it could, unless it could not do so without thereby losing some greater good or permitting some evil equally bad or worse.
# (Therefore) There does not exist an omnipotent, omniscient, wholly good being.&lt;ref name="IepEvidential" /&gt;

Another by [[Paul Draper (philosopher)|Paul Draper]]:
# Gratuitous evils exist.
# The hypothesis of indifference, ''i.e.'', that if there are supernatural beings they are indifferent to gratuitous evils, is a better explanation for (1) than theism.
# Therefore, evidence prefers that no god, as commonly understood by theists, exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Paul |last=Draper |title=Pain and Pleasure: An Evidential Problem for Theists |journal=Noûs |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=331–50 | year=1989 |doi=10.2307/2215486 |publisher=Noûs, Vol. 23, No. 3 |ref=harv |jstor=2215486}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Problem of evil and animal suffering===
{{See also|Wild animal suffering}}

The problem of evil has also been extended beyond human suffering, to include suffering of animals from cruelty, disease and evil.&lt;ref name=inwagenp120&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter van Inwagen|title=The Problem of Evil|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iQhUrE8BYFIC |year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-954397-7 |pages=120, 123–26, context: 120–33 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One version of this problem includes animal suffering from natural evil, such as the violence and fear faced by animals from predators, natural disasters, over the history of evolution.&lt;ref name=Creeganp44&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicola Hoggard Creegan|title=Animal Suffering and the Problem of Evil|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xB1pAgAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-993185-9 |pages=44–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also referred to as the Darwinian problem of evil,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Murray |title=Nature Red in Tooth and Claw: Theism and the Problem of Animal Suffering |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RZFNf9EwSSYC |year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press  |isbn=978-0-19-155327-1 |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=almeidap193/&gt; after Charles Darwin who expressed it as follows:&lt;ref name="Murray2008"/&gt;

The second version of the problem of evil applied to animals, and avoidable suffering experienced by them, is one caused by some human beings, such as from animal cruelty or when they are shot or slaughtered. This version of the problem of evil has been used by scholars including [[John Hick]] to counter the responses and defenses to the problem of evil such as suffering being a means to perfect the morals and greater good because animals are innocent, helpless, amoral but sentient victims.&lt;ref name=inwagenp120/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Diogenes Allen |editor=Marilyn McCord Adams and Robert Merrihew Adams|title=The Problem of Evil |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nqNwUSj7U7QC |year=1990|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-824866-8 |pages=204–06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=William L.

== Responses, defences and theodicies ==
Responses to the problem of evil have occasionally been classified as ''defences'' or ''theodicies;'' however, authors disagree on the exact definitions.&lt;ref name="Stanford"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IepEvidential"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopaedia |first=Ted |last=Honderich |authorlink=Ted Honderich |year=2005 |title=theodicy |encyclopedia=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |isbn=0-19-926479-1 |quote=[[John Hick]], for example, proposes a theodicy, while [[Alvin Plantinga]] formulates a defence. The idea of human free will often appears in a both of these strategies, but in different ways.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, a ''defense'' against the problem of evil may refer to attempts to defuse the logical problem of evil by showing that there is no logical incompatibility between the existence of evil and the existence of God. This task does not require the identification of a plausible explanation of evil, and is successful if the explanation provided shows that the existence of God and the existence of evil are logically compatible. It need not even be true, since a false though coherent explanation would be sufficient to show logical compatibility.&lt;ref&gt;For more explanation regarding contradictory propositions and possible worlds, see Plantinga's "God, Freedom and Evil" (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans 1974), 24–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''[[theodicy]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Coined by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] from [[Greek language|Greek]] θεός (theós), "god" and δίκη (díkē), "justice", may refer to the project of "justifying God"—showing that God's existence is compatible with the existence of evil.&lt;/ref&gt; on the other hand, is more ambitious, since it attempts to provide a plausible justification—a morally or philosophically sufficient reason—for the existence of evil and thereby rebut the "evidential" argument from evil.&lt;ref name="IepEvidential" /&gt; [[Richard Swinburne]] maintains that it does not make sense to assume there are greater goods that justify the evil's presence in the world unless we know what they are—without knowledge of what the greater goods could be, one cannot have a successful theodicy.&lt;ref name=swinburne05&gt;{{cite encyclopaedia |first=Richard |last=Swinburne |authorlink=Richard Swinburne |year=2005 |title=evil, the problem of |editor=Ted Honderich |encyclopedia=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |isbn=0-19-926479-1 |editor-link=Ted Honderich}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, some authors see arguments appealing to [[demon]]s or the [[fall of man]] as indeed logically possible, but not very ''plausible'' given our knowledge about the world, and so see those arguments as providing defences but not good theodicies.&lt;ref name="IepEvidential" /&gt;

The above argument is set against numerous versions of the problem of evil that have been formulated.&lt;ref name="Stanford" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IepEvidential" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IepLogical"&gt;The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, "[http://www.iep.utm.edu/e/evil-log.htm The Logical Problem of Evil]", James R. Beebe&lt;/ref&gt; These versions have included philosophical and theological formulations.

===Skeptical theism===
{{Main|Skeptical theism}}
Skeptical theism defends the problem of evil by asserting that God allows an evil to happen in order to prevent a greater evil or to encourage a response that will lead to a greater good.&lt;ref name=wilks31&gt;{{cite book|author=Ian Wilks |editor=Justin P.

==== "Greater good" responses ====
The [[omnipotence paradox]]es, where evil persists in the presence of an all powerful God, raise questions as to the nature of God's omnipotence. There is the further question of how an interference would negate and subjugate the concept of free will, or in other words result in a totalitarian system that creates a lack of freedom. Some solutions propose that omnipotence does not require the ability to actualize the logically impossible. "Greater good" responses to the problem make use of this insight by arguing for the existence of goods of great value which God cannot actualize without also permitting evil, and thus that there are evils he cannot be expected to prevent despite being omnipotent. Among the most popular versions of the "greater good" response are appeals to the apologetics of free will. Theologians will argue that since no one can fully understand God's ultimate plan, no one can assume that evil actions do not have some sort of greater purpose. Therefore, they say nature of evil has a necessary role to play in God's plan for a better world.&lt;ref name=WhitneyTheodicy&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitney|first1=B|title=Theodicy|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/retrieve.do?sgHitCountType=None&amp;sort=RELEVANCE&amp;inPS=true&amp;prodId=GVRL&amp;userGroupName=nysl_ce_colgul&amp;tabID=T003&amp;searchId=R1&amp;resultListType=RESULT_LIST&amp;contentSegment=&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;currentPosition=1&amp;contentSet=GALE%7CCX3407710979&amp;&amp;docId=GALE%7CCX3407710979&amp;docType=GALE|website=Gale Virtual Reference Library|publisher=Gale|accessdate=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Free will====
{{main|Free will}}

The problem of evil is sometimes explained as a consequence of [[free will]], an ability granted by God.&lt;ref name=boydp69/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lacewing2014p239"/&gt; Free will is both a source of good and of evil, and with free will also comes the potential for abuse, as when individuals act immorally. People with free will "decide to cause suffering and act in other evil ways", states Boyd, and it is they who make that choice, not God.&lt;ref name=boydp69/&gt; Further, the free will argument asserts that it would be logically inconsistent for God to prevent evil by coercion and curtailing free will, because that would no longer be free will.&lt;ref name=boydp69&gt;Gregory A. Boyd, ''Is God to Blame?'' (InterVarsity Press, 2003) {{ISBN|978-0830823949}}, pp. 55–58, 69–70, 76, 96.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lacewing2014p239"/&gt;

Critics of the free will response have questioned whether it accounts for the degree of evil seen in this world. One point in this regard is that while the value of free will may be thought sufficient to counterbalance minor evils, it is less obvious that it outweighs the negative attributes of evils such as rape and murder. Particularly egregious cases known as horrendous evils, which "[constitute] [[prima facie]] reason to doubt whether the participant’s life could (given their inclusion in it) be a great good to him/her on the whole," have been the focus of recent work in the problem of evil.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marilyn McCord Adams]], ''Horrendous Evils and the Goodness of God'' (Cornell University, 2000), 203.&lt;/ref&gt; Another point is that those actions of free beings which bring about evil very often diminish the freedom of those who suffer the evil; for example the murder of a young child prevents the child from ever exercising their free will. In such a case the freedom of an innocent child is pitted against the freedom of the evil-doer, it is not clear why God would remain unresponsive and passive.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marilyn McCord Adams]], ''Horrendous Evils and the Goodness of God'' (Melbourne University Press, 1999), 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another criticism is that the potential for evil inherent in free will may be limited by means which do not impinge on that free will. God could accomplish this by making moral actions especially pleasurable, or evil action and suffering impossible by allowing free will but not allowing the ability to enact evil or impose suffering.&lt;ref&gt;C. S. Lewis writes: "We can, perhaps, conceive of a world in which God corrected the results of this abuse of free will by His creatures at every moment: so that a wooden beam became soft as grass when it was used as a weapon, and the air refused to obey me if I attempted to set up in it the sound waves that carry lies or insults. But such a world would be one in which wrong actions were impossible, and in which, therefore, freedom of the will would be void; nay, if the principle were carried out to its logical conclusion, evil thoughts would be impossible, for the cerebral matter which we use in thinking would refuse its task when we attempted to frame them." C.S. Lewis ''[[The Problem of Pain]]'' (HarperCollins, 1996) pp. 24–25&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of the free will explanation state that that would no longer be free will.&lt;ref name=boydp69/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lacewing2014p239"/&gt; Critics respond that this view seems to imply it would be similarly wrong to try to reduce suffering and evil in these ways, a position which few would advocate.&lt;ref&gt;''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', s.v. "The Problem of Evil," Michael Tooley at http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/evil/.&lt;/ref&gt;

A third challenge to the free will defence is [[natural evil]], which is the result of natural causes (e.g. a child suffering from a disease, mass casualties from a volcano).&lt;ref&gt;"The Two Types of Evil," at http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/rs/god/chgoodandevilrev1.shtml. Accessed 10 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The "natural evil" criticism posits that even if for some reason an all-powerful and all-benevolent God tolerated evil human actions in order to allow free will, such a God would not be expected to also tolerate natural evils because they have no apparent connection to free will.&lt;ref name=boydp69/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lacewing2014p239"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Lacewing|title=Philosophy for AS: Epistemology and Philosophy of Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EoA9BAAAQBAJ |year=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-63583-3 |pages=239–42 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates of the free will response to evil propose various explanations of natural evils. [[Alvin Plantinga]],&lt;ref name="Stanford"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=God, Freedom, and Evil |last=Plantinga |first=Alvin |year=1974 |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |isbn=0-8028-1731-9 |page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; following [[Augustine of Hippo]],&lt;ref&gt;Alvin Plantinga, ''God, Freedom, and Evil'' (Eerdmans, 1989), 58.&lt;/ref&gt; and others have argued that natural evils are caused by the free choices of supernatural beings such as [[demon]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley Hanson, ''Introduction to Christian Theology'' (Fortress, 1997), 99.&lt;/ref&gt; Others have argued
:• that natural evils are the result of the [[fall of man]], which corrupted the perfect world created by God&lt;ref&gt;Linda Edwards, ''A Brief Guide'' (Westminster John Knox, 2001), 62.&lt;/ref&gt; or
:• that natural evils are the result of [[natural laws]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Polkinghorne | first = John | authorlink = John Polkinghorne | title = Belief in God in an Age of Science | publisher=Yale Nota Bene | year = 2003 | location = New Haven, CT | page = 14 | isbn = 978-0-300-09949-2 }} and also See esp. ch. 5 of his ''Science and Providence''. {{ISBN|978-0-87773-490-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; or
:• that natural evils provide us with a knowledge of evil which makes our free choices more significant than they would otherwise be, and so our free will more valuable&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Swinburne]] in "Is There a God?" writes that "the operation of natural laws producing evils gives humans knowledge (if they choose to seek it) of how to bring about such evils themselves. Observing you can catch some disease by the operation of natural processes gives me the power either to use those processes to give that disease to other people, or through negligence to allow others to catch it, or to take measures to prevent others from catching the disease." In this way, "it increases the range of significant choice... The actions which natural evil makes possible are ones which allow us to perform at our best and interact with our fellows at the deepest level" (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996) 108–09.&lt;/ref&gt; or
:• that natural evils are a mechanism of divine punishment for moral evils that humans have committed, and so the natural evil is justified.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley Hanson, ''Introduction to Christian Theology'' (Fortress, 1997), 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most scholars agree that Plantinga's free will of human and non-human spirits (demons) argument successfully solves the logical problem of evil, proving that God and evil are logically compatible&lt;ref name=meisterp134&gt;{{cite book |title=Introducing Philosophy of Religion |last=Meister |first=Chad |year=2009 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-40327-8 |page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; but other scholars explicitly dissent.&lt;ref&gt;Sobel, J.H. Logic and Theism. Cambridge University Press (2004) pp. 436–37&lt;/ref&gt; The dissenters state that while explaining infectious diseases, cancer, hurricanes and other nature-caused suffering as something that is caused by the free will of supernatural beings solves the logical version of the problem of evil, it is highly unlikely that these natural evils do not have natural causes that an omnipotent God could prevent, but instead are caused by the immoral actions of supernatural beings with free will whom God created.&lt;ref name="Stanford"/&gt; According to Michael Tooley, this defense is also highly implausible because suffering from natural evil is localized, rational causes and cures for major diseases have been found, and it is unclear why anyone, including a supernatural being whom God created would choose to inflict localized evil and suffering to innocent children for example, and why God fails to stop such suffering if he is omnipotent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alvin Plantinga|author2=Michael Tooley|title=Knowledge of God|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3xfjbwDoPj8C |year=2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4443-0131-1 |pages=101–05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Free will and animal suffering
One of the weaknesses of the free will defense is its inapplicability or contradictory applicability with respect to evils faced by animals and the consequent animal suffering. Some scholars, such as [[David Ray Griffin|David Griffin]], state that the free will, or the assumption of greater good through free will, does not apply to animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Ray Griffin|title=Evil Revisited: Responses and Reconsiderations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1NMm1lXb4SgC |year=1991|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-7914-0612-0 |pages=94–95 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John S. Feinberg |title=The Many Faces of Evil (Revised and Expanded Edition): Theological Systems and the Problems of Evil |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9w_vM7DgWN4C |year=2004|publisher=Crossway|isbn=978-1-4335-1727-3 |pages=94–95 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, a few scholars while accepting that "free will" applies in a human context, have posited an alternative "free creatures" defense, stating that animals too benefit from their physical freedom though that comes with the cost of dangers they continuously face.&lt;ref name="Nicola Hoggard Creegan 2013 48"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicola Hoggard Creegan|title=Animal Suffering and the Problem of Evil|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xB1pAgAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-993185-9|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "free creatures" defense has also been criticized, in the case of caged, domesticated and farmed animals who are not free and many of whom have historically experienced evil and suffering from abuse by their owners. Further, even animals and living creatures in the wild face horrendous evils and suffering—such as burn and slow death after natural fires or other natural disasters or from predatory injuries—and it is unclear, state Bishop and Perszyk, why an all-loving God would create such free creatures prone to intense suffering.&lt;ref name="Nicola Hoggard Creegan 2013 48"/&gt; 

; Heaven and free will

There is also debate regarding the compatibility of moral free will (to select good or evil action) with the absence of evil from heaven,&lt;ref&gt;Oppy, Graham. ''Arguing about Gods'', pp. 314–39. Cambridge University Press, 2006. {{ISBN|0521863864}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.svri.org/evil.pdf#page=72 |title=Evil, Freedom and the Heaven Dilemma |author=Simon Cushing |year=2010 |work=Challenging Evil: Time, Society and Changing Concepts of the Meaning of Evil |publisher=Inter-Disciplinary Press |deadurl=yes |accessdate=10 April 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517181511/http://www.svri.org/evil.pdf#page=72 |archivedate=17 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; with God's omniscience and with his omnibenevolence.&lt;ref name="IepLogical" /&gt;

One line of extended criticism of free will defense has been that if God is perfectly powerful, knowing and loving, then he could have actualized a world with free creatures without moral evil where everyone chooses good, is always full of loving-kindness, is compassionate, always non-violent and full of joy, where earth were just like the monotheistic concept of [[Heaven (Christianity)|heaven]]. If God did create a heaven with his love, an all-loving and always-loving God could have created an earth without evil and suffering for animals and human beings just like heaven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicola Hoggard Creegan|title=Animal Suffering and the Problem of Evil|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xB1pAgAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-993185-9|pages=48–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Process theodicy====
"Process theodicy reframes the debate on the problem of evil by denying one of its key premises: divine omnipotence."&lt;ref name="Mark S. M. Scott"/&gt;{{rp|143}}  It integrates philosophical and theological commitments while shifting theological metaphors.  For example, God becomes the Great Companion and Fellow-Sufferer where the future is realized hand-in-hand with the sufferer.&lt;ref name="Mark S. M. Scott"/&gt;{{rp|143}}

===Soul-making or Irenaean theodicy===
{{main|Irenaean theodicy}}

The soul-making or Irenaean theodicy is named after the 2nd-century Greek theologian [[Irenaeus]], whose ideas were adopted in Eastern Christianity.&lt;ref name=johnhickp201/&gt; It has been discussed by [[John Hick]], and the Irenaean theodicy asserts that evil and [[suffering]] are necessary for spiritual growth, for man to discover his soul, and God allows evil for spiritual growth of human beings.&lt;ref name=johnhickp201&gt;{{cite book|author=John Hick|title=Evil and the God of Love|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KMcYDAAAQBAJ |year=2016|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1-349-18048-6 |pages=201–16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Irenaean theodicy has been challenged with the assertion that many evils do not seem to promote spiritual growth, and can be positively destructive of the human spirit. Hick acknowledges that this process often fails in our world.&lt;ref&gt;John Hick, ''Evil and the God of Love '', (Palgrave Macmillan, 2nd edition 1977, 2010 reissue), 325, 336.&lt;/ref&gt; A second issue concerns the distribution of evils suffered: were it true that God permitted evil in order to facilitate spiritual growth, then we would expect evil to disproportionately befall those in poor spiritual health. This does not seem to be the case, as the decadent enjoy lives of luxury which insulate them from evil, whereas many of the pious are poor, and are well acquainted with worldly evils.&lt;ref&gt;The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, "The Problem of Evil", James R. Beebe&lt;/ref&gt; Thirdly, states Kane, human character can be developed directly or in constructive and nurturing loving ways, and it is unclear why God would consider or allow evil and suffering to be necessary or the preferred way to spiritual growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Hick|title=Evil and the God of Love|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KMcYDAAAQBAJ |year=2016|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1-349-18048-6 |pages=376–79 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, horrendous suffering often leads to dehumanization, its victims in truth do not grow spiritually but become vindictive and spiritually worse.&lt;ref name=Creeganp185/&gt;

This reconciliation of the problem of evil and God, states Creegan, also fails to explain the need or rationale for evil inflicted on animals and resultant animal suffering, because "there is no evidence at all that suffering improves the character of animals, or is evidence of soul-making in them".&lt;ref name=Creeganp185&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicola Hoggard Creegan |title=Animal Suffering and the Problem of Evil |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jWSL-zZ5x4QC |year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-993184-2 |page=185 with footnote 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On a more fundamental level, the soul-making theodicy assumes that the virtues developed through suffering are intrinsically, as opposed to instrumentally, good. The virtues identified as "soul-making" only appear to be valuable in a world where evil and suffering already exist. A willingness to sacrifice oneself in order to save others from persecution, for example, is virtuous precisely because persecution exists. Likewise, we value the willingness to donate one's meal to those who are starving because starvation exists. If persecution and starvation did not occur, there would be no reason to consider these acts virtuous. If the virtues developed through soul-making are only valuable where suffering exists, then it is not clear that we would lose anything if suffering did not exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rationalrealm.com/downloads/philosophy/ProblemOfEvil.pdf|website=Rational Realm|title=The Problem of Evil|first=Leslie|last=Allan|date=28 July 2015|accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cruciform theodicy====
Soul-making theodicy and Process theodicy are full theodical systems with distinctive cosmologies, theologies and perspectives on the problem of evil; cruciform theodicy is not a system but is a thematic trajectory within them.  As a result, it does not address all the questions of "the origin, nature, problem, reason and end of evil,"&lt;ref name= "Mark S. M. Scott"/&gt;{{rp|145}} but it does represent an important change. "On July 16, 1944 awaiting execution in a [[Nazi]] prison and reflecting on Christ's experience of powerlessness and pain, [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]] penned six words that became the clarion call for the modern theological paradigm shift: 'Only the suffering God can help."&lt;ref name= "Mark S. M. Scott"/&gt;{{rp|146}}  Classic theism includes "impassability" (God cannot suffer personally) as a necessary characteristic of God. Cruciform theodicy begins with Jesus' suffering "the entire spectrum of human sorrow, including economic exploitation, political disenfranchisement, social ostracism, rejection and betrayal by friends, even alienation from his own family...deep psychological distress... [grief]..." ridicule, humiliation, abandonment, beating, torture, despair, and death.&lt;ref name= "Mark S. M. Scott"/&gt;{{rp|146,148}}

Theologian [[Jürgen Moltmann]] asserts the "passibility" of God saying "A God who cannot suffer cannot love."&lt;ref name= "Mark S. M. Scott"/&gt;{{rp|150}} Philosopher and Christian priest [[Marilyn McCord Adams]] offers a theodicy of "redemptive suffering" which proposes that innocent suffering shows the "transformative power of redemption" rather than that God is not omnibenevolent.&lt;ref name= "Mark S. M. Scott"/&gt;{{rp|158–168}}

===Afterlife===
[[Thomas Aquinas]] suggested the [[afterlife]] theodicy to address the problem of evil and to justifying the existence of evil.&lt;ref name="stump2008p49"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2wDHCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA49 | title=The Evidential Argument from Evil | publisher=Indiana University Press | author=Eleonore Stump | editor=Daniel Howard-Snyder | year=2008 | pages=49–52 | isbn=0-253-11409-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The premise behind this theodicy is that the afterlife is unending, human life is short, and God allows evil and suffering in order to judge and grant everlasting heaven or hell based on human moral actions and human suffering.&lt;ref name=stump2008p49/&gt;&lt;ref name="Goetz2008p139"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Benjamin W. McCraw|author2=Robert Arp|title=The Problem of Evil: New Philosophical Directions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oUA1CwAAQBAJ |year=2015|publisher=Lexington|isbn=978-1-4985-1208-4 |pages=132–33 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aquinas says that the afterlife is the greater good that justifies the evil and suffering in current life.&lt;ref name=stump2008p49/&gt; Christian author [[Randy Alcorn]] argues that the joys of [[heaven]] will compensate for the sufferings on earth.&lt;ref&gt;If God Is Good: Faith in the Midst of Suffering and Evil, published by Random House of Canada, 2009, p. 294; Quote: Without this eternal perspective, we assume that people who die young, who have handicaps, who suffer poor health, who don't get married or have children, or who don't do this or that will miss out on the best life has to offer.  But the theology underlying these assumptions have a fatal flaw.  It presumes that our present Earth, bodies, culture, relationships and lives are all there is... [but] Heaven will bring far more than compensation for our present sufferings.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephen Maitzen has called this the "Heaven Swamps Everything" theodicy, and argues that it is false because it conflates compensation and justification.&lt;ref name="Goetz2008p139"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stewart Goetz|title=Freedom, Teleology, and Evil|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cZmvAwAAQBAJ |year=2008|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |isbn=978-1-4411-7183-2 |pages=139–47 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://philosophy.acadiau.ca/tl_files/sites/philosophy/resources/documents/Maitzen_OMIA.pdf "Ordinary Morality Implies Atheism"], European Journal for Philosophy of Religion 1:2 (2009), 107–26, Quote: "... may stem from imagining an ecstatic or forgiving state of mind on the part of the blissful: in heaven no one bears grudges, even the most horrific earthly suffering is as nothing compared to infinite bliss, all past wrongs are forgiven. But "are forgiven" doesn’t mean "were justified"; the blissful person’s disinclination to dwell on his or her earthly suffering doesn’t imply that a perfect being was justified in permitting the suffering all along. By the same token, our ordinary moral practice recognizes a legitimate complaint about child abuse even if, as adults, its victims should happen to be on drugs that make them uninterested in complaining. Even if heaven swamps everything, it doesn’t thereby justify everything."&lt;/ref&gt;

A second objection to the afterlife theodicy is that it does not reconcile the suffering of small babies and innocent children from diseases, abuse, and injury in war or terror attacks, since "human moral actions" are not to be expected from babies and uneducated/mentored children.&lt;ref name=jolley2014p66/&gt; Similarly, moral actions and the concept of choice do not apply to the problem of evil applied to animal suffering caused by natural evil or the actions of human beings.&lt;ref name=jolley2014p66&gt;{{cite book|author=Nicholas Jolley|editor=Larry M. Jorgensen and Samuel Newlands|title=New Essays on Leibniz's Theodicy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lNPQAgAAQBAJ |year=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-966003-2 |pages=64–68 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andrew Chignell|author2=Terence Cuneo|author3=Matthew C.

===Deny evil exists===
In the second century, Christian theologists attempted to reconcile the problem of evil with an omnipotent, omniscient, omnibenevolent God, by denying that evil exists. Among these theologians, [[Clement of Alexandria]] offered several theodicies, of which one was called "privation theory of evil" which was adopted thereafter.&lt;ref name="Kelly2002p42"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph Francis Kelly|title=The Problem of Evil in the Western Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rg2RJAIZ4k4C&amp;pg=PA42 |year=2002|publisher=Liturgical Press|isbn=978-0-8146-5104-9 |page=42 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The other is a more modern version of "deny evil", suggested by Christian Science, wherein the perception of evil is described as a form of illusion.&lt;ref name="Millard J. Erickson 2007, page 445-446"/&gt;

====Evil as the absence of good (privation theory)====
{{Main|Absence of good}}

The early version of "deny evil" is called the "privation theory of evil", so named because it described evil as a form of "lack, loss or privation". One of the earliest proponents of this theory was the 2nd-century Clement of Alexandria, who according to Joseph Kelly,&lt;ref name="Kelly2002p42"/&gt; stated that "since God is completely good, he could not have created evil; but if God did not create evil, then it cannot exist". Evil, according to Clement, does not exist as a positive, but exists as a negative or as a "lack of good".&lt;ref name="Kelly2002p42"/&gt; Clement's idea was criticised for its inability to explain suffering in the world, if evil did not exist. He was also pressed by Gnostics scholars with the question as to why God did not create creatures that "did not lack the good". Clement attempted to answer these questions ontologically through dualism, an idea found in the Platonic school,&lt;ref name=jeffrey49&gt;{{cite book|author=R. Jeffery |title=Evil and International Relations: Human Suffering in an Age of Terror |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7WyADAAAQBAJ |year=2007|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn=978-0-230-61035-4 |page=49 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that is by presenting two realities, one of God and Truth, another of human and perceived experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph Francis Kelly|title=The Problem of Evil in the Western Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rg2RJAIZ4k4C&amp;pg=PA42 |year=2002|publisher=Liturgical Press|isbn=978-0-8146-5104-9 |pages=42–43 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fifth-century theologian [[Augustine of Hippo]] adopted the privation theory, and in his ''Enchiridion on Faith, Hope and Love'', maintained that evil exists only as "absence of the good", that vices are nothing but the privations of natural good.&lt;ref name=jeffrey49/&gt; Evil is not a substance, states Augustine, it is nothing more than "loss of good".&lt;ref name="Pereira2013p54"/&gt; God does not participate in evil, God is perfection, His creation is perfection, stated Augustine.&lt;ref name="Pereira2013p54"/&gt; According to the privation theory, it is the absence of the good, that explains sin and moral evil.&lt;ref name="Pereira2013p54"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jairzinho Lopes Pereira |title=Augustine of Hippo and Martin Luther on Original Sin and Justification of the Sinner|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4iVcAgAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht |isbn=978-3-647-55063-3 |pages=54–55 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This view has been criticized as merely substituting definition, of evil with "loss of good", of "problem of evil and suffering" with the "problem of loss of good and suffering", but it neither addresses the issue from the theoretical point of view nor from the experiential point of view.&lt;ref name=pereira2013p56&gt;{{cite book|author=Jairzinho Lopes Pereira |title=Augustine of Hippo and Martin Luther on Original Sin and Justification of the Sinner |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4iVcAgAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht |isbn=978-3-647-55063-3 |page=56 with footnote 25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars who criticize the privation theory state that murder, rape, terror, pain and suffering are real life events for the victim, and cannot be denied as mere "lack of good".&lt;ref&gt;Todd C. Calder (2007), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20464387 Is the Privation Theory of Evil Dead?], American Philosophical Quarterly, Vol. 44, No. 4, pp. 371–81&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine, states Pereira, accepted suffering exists and was aware that the privation theory was not a solution to the problem of evil.&lt;ref name=pereira2013p56/&gt;

====Evil as illusory====
An alternative modern version of the privation theory is by [[Christian Science]], which asserts that evils such as suffering and disease only appear to be real, but in truth are illusions, and in reality evil does not exist.&lt;ref name="Millard J. Erickson 2007, page 445-446"&gt;Millard J. Erickson, Christian Theology, Second Edition, Baker Academic, 2007, pp. 445–46.&lt;/ref&gt; The theologists of Christian Science, states Stephen Gottschalk, posit that the Spirit is of infinite might, mortal human beings fail to grasp this and focus instead on evil and suffering that have no real existence as "a power, person or principle opposed to God".&lt;ref name= Gottschalkp65&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen Gottschalk |title=Christian Science |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r-FYQv75w7kC |year=1978|publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-03718-2|pages=65–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The illusion version of privation theory theodicy has been critiqued for denying the reality of crimes, wars, terror, sickness, injury, death, suffering and pain to the victim.&lt;ref name= Gottschalkp65/&gt; Further, adds Millard Erickson, the illusion argument merely shifts the problem to a new problem, as to why God would create this "illusion" of crimes, wars, terror, sickness, injury, death, suffering and pain; and why God does not stop this "illusion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Millard J. Erickson|title=Christian Theology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8Z5zBQAAQBAJ |year=1998|publisher=Baker Academic|isbn=978-0-8010-2182-4 |pages=446–47 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turning the tables===
A different approach to the problem of evil is to turn the tables by suggesting that any argument from evil is self-refuting, in that its conclusion would necessitate the falsity of one of its premises. One response—called the defensive response&lt;ref name=russell625/&gt;—has been to assert the opposite, and to point out that the assertion "evil exists" implies an ethical standard against which moral value is determined, and then to argue that this standard implies the existence of God.&lt;ref&gt;C. S. Lewis ''Mere Christianity'' Touchstone:New York, 1980 pp. 45–46&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard criticism of this view is that an argument from evil is not necessarily a presentation of the views of its proponent, but is instead intended to show how premises which the theist is inclined to believe lead him or her to the conclusion that God does not exist. A second criticism is that the existence of evil can be inferred from the suffering of its victims, rather than by the actions of the evil actor, so no "ethical standard" is implied.&lt;ref&gt;Graham Oppy (2006), ''Arguing about Gods'', pp. 17, 296. Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0521863864}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel Howard-Snyder|title=The Evidential Argument from Evil |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2wDHCgAAQBAJ |year=2008|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=0-253-11409-8 |pages= 305–06}}&lt;/ref&gt; This argument was expounded upon by David Hume.&lt;ref name=russell625&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Russell| title=The Oxford Handbook of Hume|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IMLmCwAAQBAJ |year=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-974284-4 |pages=625–32 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hidden reasons===
A variant of above defenses is that the problem of evil is derived from probability judgments since they rest on the claim that, even after careful reflection, one can see no good reason for co-existence of God and of evil. The [[inference]] from this claim to the general statement that there exists unnecessary evil is [[inductive reasoning|inductive]] in nature and it is this inductive step that sets the evidential argument apart from the logical argument.&lt;ref name="IepEvidential" /&gt;

The hidden reasons defense asserts that there exists the logical possibility of hidden or unknown reasons for the existence of evil along with the existence of an almighty, all-knowing, all-benevolent, all-powerful God. Not knowing the reason does not necessarily mean that the reason does not exist.&lt;ref name="Stanford" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IepEvidential" /&gt; This argument has been challenged with the assertion that the hidden reasons premise is as plausible as the premise that God does not exist or is not "an almighty, all-knowing, all-benevolent, all-powerful". Similarly, for every hidden argument that completely or partially justifies observed evils it is equally likely that there is a hidden argument that actually makes the observed evils worse than they appear without hidden arguments, or that the hidden reasons may result in additional contradictions.&lt;ref name="Stanford" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Frances2013p110"/&gt; As such, from an inductive viewpoint hidden arguments will neutralize one another.&lt;ref name="Stanford" /&gt;

A sub-variant of the "hidden reasons" defense is called the "PHOG"—profoundly hidden outweighing goods—defense.&lt;ref name="Frances2013p110"/&gt; The PHOG defense, states Bryan Frances, not only leaves the co-existence of God and human suffering unanswered, but raises questions about why animals and other life forms have to suffer from natural evil, or from abuse (animal slaughter, animal cruelty) by some human beings, where hidden moral lessons, hidden social good and such hidden reasons to reconcile God with the problem of evil do not apply.&lt;ref name="Frances2013p110"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bryan Frances |title=Gratuitous Suffering and the Problem of Evil: A Comprehensive Introduction |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ngeIkSJnh4kC&amp;pg=PA110|date=2013 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-66295-6 |pages=110–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Previous lives and karma===
The theory of [[karma]] refers to the spiritual principle of cause and effect where intent and actions of an individual (cause) influence the future of that individual (effect).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/312474/karma Karma] Encyclopædia Britannica (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; The problem of evil, in the context of karma, has been long discussed in Indian religions including Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism, both in its theistic and non-theistic schools; for example, in Uttara Mīmāṃsā Sutras Book 2 Chapter 1;&lt;ref&gt;Francis Clooney (2005), in The Blackwell Companion to Hinduism (Editor: [[Gavin Flood]]), Wiley-Blackwell, {{ISBN|0631215352}}, pp. 454–55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Francis Clooney (1989), ‘‘Evil, Divine Omnipotence and Human Freedom: Vedanta’s theology of Karma, Journal of Religion, Vol. 69, pp 530–48&lt;/ref&gt; the 8th-century arguments by Adi Sankara in ''Brahmasutrabhasya'' where he posits that God cannot reasonably be the cause of the world because there exists moral evil, inequality, cruelty and suffering in the world;&lt;ref name=bilimoria&gt;P.

Many Indian religions place greater emphasis on developing the karma principle for first cause and innate justice with Man as focus, rather than developing religious principles with the nature and powers of God and divine judgment as focus.&lt;ref&gt;B. Reichenbach (1998), Karma and the Problem of Evil, in Philosophy of Religion Toward a Global Perspective (Editor: G.E. Kessler), Wadsworth, {{ISBN|978-0534505493}}, pp. 248–55&lt;/ref&gt; Karma theory of Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism is not static, but dynamic wherein livings beings with intent or without intent, but with words and actions continuously create new karma, and it is this that they believe to be in part the source of good or evil in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Yuvraj Krishan |title=The Doctrine of Karma: Its Origin and Development in Brāhmaṇical, Buddhist, and Jaina Traditions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_Bi6FWX1NOgC |year=1997|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan |isbn=978-81-208-1233-8 |pages=17–20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These religions also believe that past lives or past actions in current life create current circumstances, which also contributes to either. Other scholars&lt;ref&gt;Ursula Sharma (1973), Theodicy and the doctrine of karma, ‘‘Man’’, Vol. 8, No. 3, pp. 347–64&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that nontheistic Indian religious traditions do not assume an omnibenevolent creator, and some&lt;ref&gt;The Nyaya-Vaisesika school of Hinduism is one of the exceptions where the premise is similar to the Christian concept of an omnibenevolent, omnipotent creator&lt;/ref&gt; theistic schools do not define or characterize their god(s) as monotheistic Western religions do and the deities have colorful, complex personalities; the Indian deities are personal and cosmic facilitators, and in some schools conceptualized like Plato’s [[Demiurge]].&lt;ref name=bilimoria2013&gt;P.

Obeyesekere (I968), Theodicy, sin and salvation in a sociology of Buddhism, in Practical religion (Ed. Edmund Leach), Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0521055253}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Arthur Herman, karma-transmigration theory solves all three historical formulations to the problem of evil while acknowledging the theodicy insights of Sankara and Ramanuja.&lt;ref name=arthurhermanp5&gt;Arthur Herman, The problem of evil and Indian thought, 2nd Edition, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-20807537}}, pp. 5 with Part II and III of the book&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pandeism===
[[Pandeism]] is a modern theory that unites deism and pantheism, and asserts that God created the universe but during creation became the universe.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Deism#ref1042352 Deism], Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt; In pandeism, God is no superintending, heavenly power, capable of hourly intervention into earthly affairs. No longer existing "above," God ''cannot'' intervene from above and cannot be blamed for failing to do so. God, in pandeism, was omnipotent and omnibenevolent, but in the form of universe is no longer omnipotent, omnibenevolent.&lt;ref name="Lane"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Lane | first = William C. | date = January 2010 |title = Leibniz's Best World Claim Restructured | url = http://apq.press.illinois.edu/47/1/lane.html | journal = American Philosophical Journal | publisher = | volume = 47 | issue = 1 | pages = 57–84 |accessdate=9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|76–77}}

====The Bible====
Sociologist [[Walter Brueggemann]] says theodicy is "a constant concern of the entire Bible" and needs to "include the category of social evil as well as moral, natural (physical) and religious evil".&lt;ref name="Anthony J.Tambasco"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Tambasco|editor1-first=Anthony J.|title=The Bible on Suffering: Social and Political Implications|date=2001|publisher=Paulist Press|location=New York|isbn=0-8091-4048-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|12}}  There is general agreement among Bible scholars that the Bible "does not admit of a singular perspective on evil. ...Instead we encounter a variety of perspectives...  Consequently [the Bible focuses on] moral and spiritual remedies, not rational or logical [justifications].  ...It is simply that the Bible operates within a cosmic, moral and spiritual landscape rather than within a rationalist, abstract, ontological landscape."&lt;ref name="Mark S.

Philosopher [[Richard Swinburne]] says that, as it stands in its classic form, the argument from evil is unanswerable, yet there may be contrary reasons for not reaching its conclusion that there is no God.&lt;ref&gt;Swinburne, Richard. (1998). ''Providence and the Problem of Evil''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; These reasons are of three kinds: other strong reasons for affirming that there is a God; general reasons for doubting the force of the argument itself; and specific reasons for doubting the criteria of any of the argument's premises; "in other words, a theodicy."&lt;ref&gt;Swinburne, Richard. (1998). ''Providence and the Problem of Evil''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt;  Christianity has responded with multiple traditional theodicies: the Punishment theodicy (Augustine), the Soul-making theodicy (Irenaeus), Process theodicy (Rabbi Harold Kushner), Cruciform theodicy (Moltmann), and the free-will defense (Plantinga) among them.&lt;ref name="Mark S. M. Scott"/&gt;

There are, essentially, four representations of evil in the Bible: chaos, human sin, Satanic/demonic forces, and suffering.&lt;ref name="Mark S. M. Scott"/&gt;{{rp|14}} The biblical language of chaos and chaos monsters such as Leviathan remind us order and harmony in our world are constantly assailed by forces "inimical to God's good creation."&lt;ref name="Mark S. M. Scott"/&gt;{{rp|17}} The Bible primarily speaks of sin as moral evil rather than natural or metaphysical evil with an accent on the breaking of God's moral laws, his covenant, the teachings of Christ and the injunctions of the Holy Spirit.&lt;ref name="Mark S. M. Scott"/&gt;{{rp|21}} The writers of the Bible take the reality of a spiritual world beyond this world and its containment of hostile spiritual forces for granted. While the post-Enlightenment world does not, the "dark spiritual forces" can be seen as "symbols of the darkest recesses of human nature."&lt;ref name="Mark S. M. Scott"/&gt;{{rp|25,28}} Suffering and misfortune are sometimes represented as evil in the Bible, though theologian Brian Han Gregg says, suffering in the Bible is represented twelve different ways.&lt;ref name="Mark S.

*Deuteronomy 30 and Hebrews 12 open the possibilities that suffering may be punishment, natural consequences, or God's loving discipline. 
*Genesis 4:1-8 and the first murder suggests much suffering is the result of certain people's choices. 
*Genesis 45 says God's redemptive power is stronger than suffering and can be used to further good purposes. 
*Luke 22:31-34 says resist the fear and despair that accompany suffering, instead remember/believe God has the power to help. 
*Job 40 says God is not like humans but wants a relationship with all of them, which requires some surrender to God and acceptance of suffering.
*Romans 8:18-30 sets present temporary suffering within the context of God's eternal purposes. 
*Hebrews 12:1-6 sets suffering within the concept of "soul-making" as do 2 Peter 1:5-8, James 1, and others. 
*Exodus 17:1-7 and the whole book of Job characterize suffering as testing and speak of God's right to test human loyalty. 
*2 Corinthians 4:7-12 says human weakness during suffering reveals God's strength and that it is part of the believer's calling to embrace suffering in solidarity with Christ. 
*2 Corinthians 1:3-7 says God is the comforter and that people learn how to better comfort others when they have personal experience of suffering.  
*The great hymn in Philippians 2, along with Colossians 1:24, combine to claim Christ redeems suffering itself.  Believers are invited to share in that by emulating his good thoughts, words and deeds. All New Testament teachings on suffering are all grounded in and circle back to the fall of mankind and the possible redemptive power to individuals of the cross.&lt;ref name="Brian Han Gregg"/&gt;{{rp|160,161}}

Jewish theodicy is experiencing extensive revision in light of the Holocaust while still asserting the difference between the human and divine perspective of evil. It remains rooted in the nature of creation itself and the limitation inherent in matter's capacity to be perfected; the action of freewill includes the potential for perfection from individual effort and leaves evil in human hands.&lt;ref name="Oliver Leaman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leaman|first1=Oliver|title=Evil and Suffering in Jewish Philosophy|date=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-521-41724-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|70}}

In the Bible, all characterizations of evil and suffering reveal "a God who is greater than suffering [who] is powerful, creative and committed to His creation [who] always has the last word."  God's commitment to the greater good is assumed in all cases.&lt;ref name="Brian Han Gregg"/&gt;{{rp|162,168}}

====Judgment Day====
John Joseph Haldane's Wittgenstinian-Thomistic account of concept formation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haldane|first1=J.J.|title=Atheism and Theism|date=2003|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|isbn=0-631-23259-1|pages=102–05|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Martin Heidegger's observation of temporality's thrown nature&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heidegger|first1=Martin|title=Being and Time|origyear=1962|year=2003|publisher=Blackwell|isbn=0-631-19770-2|pages=426–27 (H 374) 458–72 (H 406–21)}}&lt;/ref&gt; imply that God's act of creation and God's act of judgment are the same act. God's condemnation of evil is subsequently believed to be executed and expressed in his created world; a judgement that is unstoppable due to God's all powerful will; a constant and eternal judgement that becomes announced and communicated to other people on [[Judgment Day]]. In this explanation, God's condemnation of evil is declared to be a good judgement.

====Irenaean theodicy====
[[Irenaean theodicy]], posited by [[Irenaeus]] (2nd century CE–c. 202), has been reformulated by [[John Hick]]. It holds that one cannot achieve moral goodness or love for God if there is no evil and suffering in the world. Evil is [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]-making and leads one to be truly moral and close to God. God created an [[epistemic]] distance (such that God is not immediately knowable) so that we may strive to know him and by doing so become truly good. Evil is a means to good for three main reasons:

# ''Means of knowledge'' – Hunger leads to pain, and causes a desire to feed. Knowledge of pain prompts humans to seek to help others in pain.
# ''Character building'' – Evil offers the opportunity to grow morally. "We would never learn the art of goodness in a world designed as a hedonistic paradise" (''Richard Swinburne'')
# ''Predictable environment'' – The world runs to a series of natural laws. These are independent of any inhabitants of the universe. Natural Evil only occurs when these natural laws conflict with our own perceived needs. This is not immoral in any way

====Augustinian theodicy====
St [[Augustine of Hippo]] (354–430 CE) in his [[Augustinian theodicy]], as presented in John Hick's book ''Evil and the God of Love'', focuses on the Genesis story that essentially dictates that God created the world and that it was good; evil is merely a consequence of [[the fall of man]] (The story of the Garden of Eden where Adam and Eve disobeyed God and caused inherent sin for man). Augustine stated that [[natural evil]] (evil present in the natural world such as natural disasters etc.) is caused by fallen angels, whereas [[moral evil]] (evil caused by the will of human beings) is as a result of man having become estranged from God and choosing to deviate from his chosen path. Augustine argued that God could not have created evil in the world, as it was created good, and that all notions of evil are simply a deviation or privation of goodness. Evil cannot be a separate and unique substance. For example, Blindness is not a separate entity, but is merely a lack or privation of sight. Thus the Augustinian theodicist would argue that the problem of evil and suffering is void because God did not create evil; it was man who chose to deviate from the path of perfect goodness.

====St. Thomas Aquinas====
Saint Thomas systematized the Augustinian conception of evil, supplementing it with his own musings. Evil, according to St. Thomas, is a privation, or the absence of some good which belongs properly to the nature of the creature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://josephkenny.joyeurs.com/CDtexts/ContraGentiles3a.htm#7 ''Summa Contra Gentiles'' III c. 7]&lt;/ref&gt; There is therefore no positive source of evil, corresponding to the greater good, which is God;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1049.htm#article3|title=SUMMA THEOLOGIAE: The cause of evil (Prima Pars, Q. 49)|website=www.newadvent.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; evil being not real but rational—i.e. it exists not as an objective fact, but as a subjective conception; things are evil not in themselves, but by reason of their relation to other things or persons. All realities are in themselves good; they produce bad results only incidentally; and consequently the ultimate cause of evil is fundamentally good, as well as the objects in which evil is found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1049.htm#article1|title=SUMMA THEOLOGIAE: The cause of evil (Prima Pars, Q. 49)|website=www.newadvent.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Luther and Calvin ====
{{main|Original sin}}
Both [[Martin Luther|Luther]] and [[John Calvin|Calvin]] explained evil as a consequence of the [[fall of man]] and the [[original sin]]. Calvin, however, held to the belief in [[predestination]] and omnipotence, the fall is part of God's plan. Luther saw evil and original sin as an inheritance from Adam and Eve, passed on to all mankind from their conception and bound the will of man to serving sin, which God's just nature allowed as consequence for their distrust, though God planned mankind's redemption through [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=On the Bondage of the Will|last=Luther|first=Martin|publisher=|year=1525|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately humans may not be able to understand and explain this plan.&lt;ref&gt;The Problem of Evil in the Western Tradition: From the Book of Job to Modern Genetics, Joseph F. Kelly, p. 94–96&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Liberal Christianity ====
Some modern [[liberal Christianity|liberal Christians]], including French Calvinist theologian André Gounelle and Pastor Marc Pernot of [[L'Oratoire du Louvre]], believe that God is not omnipotent, and that the Bible only describes God as "almighty" in passages concerning the [[End Times]].&lt;ref name="andregounelle.fr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://andregounelle.fr/dieu/quelle-puissance-l-impossible-toute-puissance.php|title=Quelle puissance ?|website=andregounelle.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oratoiredulouvre.fr"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://oratoiredulouvre.fr/dictionnaire/puissant-tout-puissant.php|title=Puissant - Tout-Puissant - Oratoire du Louvre|first=|last=Stereoweb|date=1 July 2018|website=Oratoire du Louvre}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Christian Science====
{{see also|Christian Science#Evil}}
[[Christian Science]] views evil as having no ultimate reality and as being due to false beliefs, consciously or unconsciously held. Evils such as illness and death may be banished by correct understanding. This view has been questioned, aside from the general criticisms of the concept of evil as an illusion discussed earlier, since the presumably correct understanding by Christian Science members, including the founder, has not prevented illness and death.&lt;ref name="Millard J. Erickson 2007, page 445-446"/&gt; However, Christian Scientists believe that the many instances of spiritual healing (as recounted e.g. in the Christian Science periodicals and in the textbook Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures by Mary Baker Eddy) are [[anecdotal evidence]] of the correctness of the teaching of the unreality of evil.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Peel, 1987, Spiritual Healing in a Scientific Age, San Francisco, Harper and Row, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; According to one author, the denial by Christian Scientists that evil ultimately exists neatly solves the problem of evil; however, most people cannot accept that solution&lt;ref&gt;Ben Dupre, "The Problem of Evil," 50 Philosophy Ideas You Really Need to Know, London, Quercus, 2007, p. 166: "Denying that there is ultimately any such thing as evil, as advocated by Christian Scientists, solves the problem at a stroke, but such a remedy is too hard for most to swallow."&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jehovah's Witnesses====
[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] believe that [[Satan]] is the original cause of evil.&lt;ref&gt;"Why All Suffering Is Soon to End", ''The Watchtower'', 15 May 2007, p. 21, "For some, the obstacle [to believing in God] involves what is often called the ''problem of evil''. They feel that if God exists and is almighty and loving, the evil and suffering in the world cannot be explained. No God who tolerates evil could exist, they reason... Satan has surely proved adept at blinding human minds. ...God is not responsible for the wickedness so prevalent in the world." [emphasis added] [http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2007366]&lt;/ref&gt; Though once a perfect angel, Satan developed feelings of self-importance and craved worship, and eventually challenged God's right to rule. Satan caused [[Adam and Eve]] to disobey God, and humanity subsequently became participants in a challenge involving the competing claims of Jehovah and Satan to universal sovereignty.&lt;ref name="pentonsatan"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Penton | first = M.J. | title = Apocalypse Delayed | publisher = University of Toronto Press | year = 1997 | pages = 189–90 | isbn = 9780802079732}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other angels who sided with Satan became [[demon]]s.

God's subsequent tolerance of evil is explained in part by the value of free will. But Jehovah's Witnesses also hold that this period of suffering is one of non-interference from God, which serves to demonstrate that [[Jehovah]]'s "right to rule" is both correct and in the best interests of all intelligent beings, settling the "issue of universal sovereignty". Further, it gives individual humans the opportunity to show their willingness to submit to God's rulership.

At some future time known to him, God will consider his right to universal sovereignty to have been settled for all time. The [[Justification (theology)|reconciliation of "faithful" humankind]] will have been accomplished through [[Christ]], and nonconforming humans and demons will have been destroyed. Thereafter, evil (any failure to submit to God's rulership) will be summarily executed.&lt;ref&gt;"Why Does God Allow Evil and Suffering?", ''The Watchtower'', 1 May 2011, p. 16, [http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2011331]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jw.org/en/publications/magazines/g201107/why-so-much-suffering/ "Why Is There So Much Suffering?", ''Awake'', July 2011, p. 4]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ====
[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) introduces a concept similar to [[Problem of evil#Irenaean theodicy|Irenaean theodicy]], that experiencing evil is a necessary part of the development of the soul. Specifically, the laws of nature prevent an individual from fully comprehending or experiencing good without experiencing its opposite.&lt;ref&gt;[[Book of Mormon]], [[Second Book of Nephi|2 Nephi]] {{lds||2-ne|2|11|13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this respect, Latter-day Saints do not regard [[fall of man|the fall]] of [[Adam and Eve (LDS Church)|Adam and Eve]] as a tragic, unplanned cancellation of an eternal paradise; rather they see it as an essential element of God's plan.

This is a departure from the mainstream Christian definition of [[omnipotence]] and [[omniscience]], which Mormons believe was changed by post-apostolic theologians in the centuries after Christ. The writings of [[Justin Martyr]], [[Origen]], [[Augustine]], and others indicate a merging of Christian principles with Greek metaphysical philosophies such as [[Neoplatonism]], which described divinity as an [[divine simplicity|utterly simple]], immaterial, formless substance/essence ([[ousia]]) that was the absolute causality and creative source of all that existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last= Bickmore |first= Barry R. |authorlink= Barry R.

According to Jon Levenson, the writers of Hebrew Bible were well aware of evil as a theological problem, but he does not claim awareness of the problem of evil.&lt;ref name=hoffman17&gt;{{cite book|author1=Henning Graf Reventlow |author2=Yair Hoffman |title=The Problem of Evil and its Symbols in Jewish and Christian Tradition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iBQx7JmufUkC |year=2004|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |isbn=978-0-8264-0085-7 |page=17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, according to Yair Hoffman, the ancient books of the Hebrew Bible do not show an awareness of the theological problem of evil, and even most later biblical scholars did not touch the question of the problem of evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Henning Graf Reventlow |author2=Yair Hoffman |title=The Problem of Evil and its Symbols in Jewish and Christian Tradition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iBQx7JmufUkC |year=2004|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |isbn=978-0-8264-0085-7 |pages=16–18|quote=... nowhere in this book is there a comprehensive concept of evil as such, let alone awareness of a theological problem of evil. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest awareness of the problem of evil in Judaism tradition is evidenced in extra- and post-biblical sources such as early [[Apocrypha]] (secret texts by unknown authors, which were not considered mainstream at the time they were written).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Henning Graf Reventlow |author2=Yair Hoffman |title=The Problem of Evil and its Symbols in Jewish and Christian Tradition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iBQx7JmufUkC |year=2004|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |isbn=978-0-8264-0085-7 |page=26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first systematic reflections on the problem of evil by Jewish philosophers is traceable only in the medieval period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nicholas Robert Michael De Lange|author2=Miri Freud-Kandel |title=Modern Judaism: An Oxford Guide |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bugTDAAAQBAJ |year=2005| publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-926287-8 |page=315 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem of evil gained renewed interest among Jewish scholars after the moral evil of the [[Holocaust]].&lt;ref name="LangeKandel2005p31"/&gt; The all-powerful, all-compassionate, all-knowing monotheistic God presumably had the power to prevent the Holocaust, but he didn't.&lt;ref name="LangeKandel2005p31"/&gt; The Jewish thinkers have argued that either God did not care about the torture and suffering in the world He created—which means He is not omnibenevolent, or He did not know what was happening—which means He is not omniscient.&lt;ref name="LangeKandel2005p31"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nicholas Robert Michael De Lange|author2=Miri Freud-Kandel|title=Modern Judaism: An Oxford Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bugTDAAAQBAJ |year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-926287-8 |pages=314–15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The persecution of Jewish people was not a new phenomenon, and medieval Jewish thinkers had in abstract attempted to reconcile the logical version of the problem of evil.&lt;ref name="LangeKandel2005p31"/&gt; The Holocaust experience and other episodes of mass extermination such as the [[Gulag]] and the [[Killing Fields]] where millions of people experienced torture and died, however, brought into focus the visceral nature of the evidential version of the problem of evil.&lt;ref name="LangeKandel2005p31"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph Francis Kelly |title=The Problem of Evil in the Western Tradition: From the Book of Job to Modern Genetics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rg2RJAIZ4k4C |year=2002|publisher=Liturgical Press |isbn=978-0-8146-5104-9 |pages=219–20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other religions==
===Ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt===
The [[ancient Egypt]]ian religion, according to {{proper name|Roland Enmarch}}, potentially absolved their gods from any blame for evil, and used a negative cosmology and the negative concept of human nature to explain evil.&lt;ref name=enmarch2&gt;Roland Enmarch (2008), [http://digital2.library.ucla.edu/viewFile.do?contentFileId=1700601 Theodicy], UCLA Encyclopedia of Egyptology, Editors: Dieleman and Wendrich&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the Pharaoh was seen as an agent of the gods and his actions as a king were aimed to prevent evil and curb evilness in human nature.&lt;ref name=enmarch2/&gt;

===Ancient Greek religion===
The gods in [[Ancient Greek religion]] were seen as superior, but shared similar traits with humans and often interacted with them.&lt;ref name=Homer&gt;{{cite book|last1=Homer|title=The Iliad|date=1990|publisher=Penguin Books|location=NewYork}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Greeks didn't believe in any "evil" gods, the Greeks still acknowledged the fact that evil was present in the world.&lt;ref name="Greek/Gods"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kirby|first1=John|title=Gods and Goddesses|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/retrieve.do?sgHitCountType=None&amp;sort=RELEVANCE&amp;inPS=true&amp;prodId=GVRL&amp;userGroupName=nysl_ce_colgul&amp;tabID=T003&amp;searchId=R7&amp;resultListType=RESULT_LIST&amp;contentSegment=&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;currentPosition=2&amp;contentSet=GALE%7CCX3035100157&amp;&amp;docId=GALE%7cCX3035100157&amp;docType=GALE|website=Gale Virtual Reference Library|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gods often meddled in the affairs of men, and sometimes their actions consisted of bringing misery to people, for example gods would sometimes be a direct cause of death for people.&lt;ref name="Homer"/&gt; However, the Greeks did not consider the gods to be evil as a result of their actions, instead the answer for most situations in Greek mythology was the power of [[fate]].&lt;ref name=Fate&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bolle|first1=Kees|title=Fate|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/retrieve.do?sgHitCountType=None&amp;sort=RELEVANCE&amp;inPS=true&amp;prodId=GVRL&amp;userGroupName=nysl_ce_colgul&amp;tabID=T003&amp;searchId=R12&amp;resultListType=RESULT_LIST&amp;contentSegment=&amp;searchType=BasicSearchForm&amp;currentPosition=1&amp;contentSet=GALE%7CCX3424501004&amp;&amp;docId=GALE%7cCX3424501004&amp;docType=GALE|website=Gale Virtual Reference Library|publisher=Macmillan Reference USA|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fate is considered to be more powerful than the gods themselves and for this reason no one can escape it.&lt;ref name="Fate"/&gt; For this reason the Greeks recognized that unfortunate events were justifiable by the idea of fate.&lt;ref name="Fate"/&gt;

Later Greek and Roman theologians and philosophers discussed the problem of evil in depth. Starting at least with Plato, philosophers tended to reject or de-emphasize literal interpretations of mythology in favor of a more [[Pantheism|pantheistic]], [[natural theology]] based on reasoned arguments. In this framework, stories that seemed to impute dishonorable conduct to the gods were often simply dismissed as false, and as being nothing more than the "imagination of poets."  Greek and Roman thinkers continued to wrestle, however, with the problems of [[natural evil]] and of evil that we observe in our day-to-day experience.  Influential Roman writers such as [[De Natura Deorum|Cicero]] and [[De Providentia|Seneca]], drawing on earlier work by the Greek philosophers such as the [[Stoicism|Stoics]], developed many arguments in defense of the righteousness of the gods, and many of the answers they provided were later absorbed into Christian [[theodicy]].{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

===Buddhism===
[[Buddhism]] neither denies the existence of evil, nor does it attempt to reconcile evil in a way attempted by monotheistic religions that assert the existence of an almighty, all powerful, all knowing, all benevolent God.&lt;ref name=koslowski10&gt;{{cite book|author=P.

Buddhism accepts that there is evil in the world, as well as [[Dukkha]] (suffering) that is caused by evil or because of natural causes (aging, disease, rebirth). The precepts and practices of Buddhism, such as [[Four Noble Truths]] and [[Noble Eightfold Path]] aim to empower a follower in gaining insights and liberation ([[nirvana]]) from the cycle of such suffering as well as rebirth.&lt;ref name=koslowski10/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Paul Williams|author2=Anthony Tribe|author3=Alexander Wynne|title=Buddhist Thought: A Complete Introduction to the Indian Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BVvFBQAAQBAJ |year=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-52087-7 |pages=30–52 |chapter=Chapter 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some strands of Mahayana Buddhism developed a theory of [[Buddha-nature]] in texts such as the ''Tathagata-garbha Sutras'' composed in 3rd-century south India, which is very similar to the "soul, self" theory found in classical Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Williams|title=Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GMN-AgAAQBAJ|year=2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-25056-1|pages=103–09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=S.

This premise leads to the question as to why anyone does any evil, and why doesn't the "intrinsically pure inner Buddha" attempt or prevail in preventing the evil actor before he or she commits the evil.&lt;ref name="Harvey2013p141"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Harvey |title=An Introduction to Buddhism: Teachings, History and Practices |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u0sg9LV_rEgC |year=2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-85942-4 |pages=37, 141 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One response has been that the Buddha-nature is omnibenevolent, but not omnipotent. Further, the ''Tathagata-garbha Sutras'' are atypical texts of Buddhism, because they contradict the [[Anatta]] doctrines in a vast majority of Buddhist texts, leading scholars to posit that the ''Tathagatagarbha Sutras'' were written to promote Buddhism to non-Buddhists, and that they do not represent mainstream Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Williams|title=Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GMN-AgAAQBAJ|year=2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-25056-1|pages=104–05, 108}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Merv Fowler|title=Buddhism: Beliefs and Practices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A7UKjtA0QDwC|year=1999|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|isbn=978-1-898723-66-0|pages=101–02|quote=Some texts of the ''tathagatagarbha'' literature, such as the ''Mahaparinirvana Sutra'' actually refer to an ''atman'', though other texts are careful to avoid the term.

Indeed, the distinctions between the general Indian concept of ''atman'' and the popular Buddhist concept of Buddha-nature are often blurred to the point that writers consider them to be synonymous.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mainstream Buddhism, from its early days, did not need to address the theological problem of evil as it saw no need for a creator of the universe and asserted instead, like many Indian traditions, that the universe never had a beginning and all existence is an endless cycle of rebirths (samsara).&lt;ref name="Harvey2013p141"/&gt;

Further, [[Deity|deities]] in Hinduism are neither eternal nor omnipotent nor omniscient nor omnibenevolent. [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]] are mortal and subject to [[samsara]].

{{Quote|
For that would lead to the possibility of partiality and cruelty. For it can be reasonably concluded that God has passion and hatred like some ignoble persons... Hence there will be a nullification of God's nature of extreme purity, (unchangeability), etc., [...] And owing to infliction of misery and destruction on all creatures, God will be open to the charge of pitilessness and extreme cruelty, abhorred even by a villain. Thus on account of the possibility of partiality and cruelty, God is not an agent.

Shankara attributes evil and cruelty in the world to [[Karma]] of oneself, of others, and to ignorance, delusion and wrong knowledge,&lt;ref name=sharma2008p31/&gt; but not to the abstract Brahman.&lt;ref name=sradha30/&gt; Brahman itself is beyond good and evil.

According to Swami Gambhirananda of Ramakrishna Mission, Sankara's commentary explains that God cannot be charged with partiality or cruelty (i.e. injustice) on account of his taking the factors of virtuous and vicious actions (Karma) performed by an individual in previous lives. If an individual experiences pleasure or pain in this life, it is due to virtuous or vicious action (Karma) done by that individual in a past life.&lt;ref name=Gambhirananda1965&gt;{{cite book|author=Swami Gambhirananda |title=Brahma Sutra Bhasya Of Shankaracharya |url=https://www.amazon.com/Brahma-Sutra-Bhasya-Shankaracharya-Sankaracarya/dp/8175051051 |year=1965|publisher=Vedanta Press &amp; Bookshop |isbn=978-8175051058 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=December 2016}}

A sub-tradition within the [[Vaishnavism]] school of Hinduism that is an exception is dualistic [[Dvaita]], founded by [[Madhvacharya]] in the 13th-century. This tradition posits a concept of God so similar to Christianity, that Christian missionaries in colonial India suggested that Madhvacharya was likely influenced by early Christians who migrated to India,&lt;ref name=skhk177&gt;Sabapathy Kulandran and Hendrik Kraemer (2004), Grace in Christianity and Hinduism, James Clarke, {{ISBN|978-0227172360}}, pp. 177–79&lt;/ref&gt; a theory that has been discredited by scholars.{{Sfn|Jones|Ryan|2006|p=266}}{{Sfn|Sarma|2000|pp=19–21}} Madhvacharya was challenged by Hindu scholars on the problem of evil, given his dualistic ''Tattvavada'' theory that proposed God and living beings along with universe as separate realities. Madhvacharya asserted, ''Yathecchasi tatha kuru'', which Sharma translates and explains as "one has the right to choose between right and wrong, a choice each individual makes out of his own responsibility and his own risk".{{Sfn|Sharma|1962|p=361}} Madhva's reply does not address the problem of evil, state Dasti and Bryant, as to how can evil exist with that of a God who is omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent.&lt;ref name=dastibryantfw&gt;{{cite book|author=David Buchta |editor=Matthew R.

According to Sharma, "Madhva's tripartite classification of souls makes it unnecessary to answer the problem of evil".{{Sfn|Sharma|1962|pp=270, 370–71, ''Quote:'' The problem of evil and suffering in the world is the most difficult one in Theism. We have explained Madhva's attitude to the allied problem of freedom and freewill, on the basis of the doctrine of natural selection of good or bad and of the tripartite classification of souls. It is not therefore necessary for Madhva to answer the question of the consistency of evil with Divine goodness.}} According to David Buchta, this does not address the problem of evil, because the omnipotent God "could change the system, but chooses not to" and thus sustains the evil in the world.&lt;ref name=dastibryantfw/&gt; This view of self's agency of Madhvacharya was, states Buchta, an outlier in Vedanta school and Indian philosophies in general.&lt;ref name=dastibryantfw/&gt;

[[File:Epikouros BM 1843.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The earliest statement of the problem of evil is attributed to Epicurus, but this is uncertain.&lt;ref name=mcbrayer26/&gt;]]

===Epicurus===
[[Epicurus]] is generally credited with first expounding the problem of evil, and it is sometimes called the "[[Epicurean paradox]]", the "riddle of Epicurus", or the "Epicurus' [[trilemma]]":

{{Quote|
&lt;poem&gt;
Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able? Then he is not omnipotent.
Is he able, but not willing? Then he is malevolent.
Is he both able and willing? Then whence cometh evil?
Is he neither able nor willing? Then why call him God?
&lt;/poem&gt;
|The Epicurean paradox|~300 BCE&lt;ref&gt;Hospers, John. ''An Introduction to Philosophical Analysis''. 3rd Ed. Routledge, 1990, p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There is no surviving written text of Epicurus that establishes that he actually formulated the problem of evil in this way, and it is uncertain that he was the author.&lt;ref name=mcbrayer26&gt;{{cite book|author1=Justin P. McBrayer|author2=Daniel Howard-Snyder|title=The Blackwell Companion to The Problem of Evil|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J0ScAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT26 |year=2014|publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-1-118-60797-8 |page=26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An attribution to him can be found in a text dated about 600 years later, in the 3rd century Christian theologian [[Lactantius]]'s ''Treatise on the Anger of God''{{refn|group=note|{{quote|''Quod si haec ratio vera est, quam stoici nullo modo videre potuerunt, dissolvitur etiam argumentum illud Epicuri.

{{quote|But if this account is true, which the Stoics were in no manner able to see, that argument also of Epicurus is done away.

If He is willing and is unable, He is feeble, which is not in accordance with the character of God; if He is able and unwilling, He is envious, which is equally at variance with God; if He is neither willing or able, He is both envious and feeble, and therefore not God; if He is both willing and able, which alone is suitable to God,
from what source then are evils or why does He not remove them?

}} where Lactantius critiques the argument. Epicurus's argument as presented by Lactantius actually argues that a god that is all-powerful and all-good does not exist and that the gods are distant and uninvolved with man's concerns. The gods are neither our friends nor enemies.

===David Hume===
[[David Hume]]'s formulation of the problem of evil in ''[[Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Is he [God] willing to prevent evil, but not able? then is he impotent. Is he able, but not willing? then is he malevolent. Is he both able and willing? whence then is evil?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Hume, David |title=Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion |publisher=Project Gutenberg |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/4583 |accessdate=12 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"[God's] power we allow [is] infinite: Whatever he wills is executed: But neither man nor any other animal are happy: Therefore he does not will their happiness. His wisdom is infinite: He is never mistaken in choosing the means to any end: But the course of nature tends not to human or animal felicity: Therefore it is not established for that purpose. Through the whole compass of human knowledge, there are no inferences more certain and infallible than these. In what respect, then, do his benevolence and mercy resemble the benevolence and mercy of men?"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Gottfried Leibniz===
[[File:Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Bernhard Christoph Francke.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Gottfried Leibniz]]

In his ''[[Dictionnaire Historique et Critique]]'', the [[scepticism|sceptic]] [[Pierre Bayle]] denied the goodness and omnipotence of God on account of the [[suffering]]s experienced in this earthly life. [[Gottfried Leibniz]] introduced the term theodicy in his 1710 work ''[[Essais de Théodicée sur la bonté de Dieu, la liberté de l'homme et l'origine du mal]]'' ("Theodicic Essays on the Benevolence of God, the Free will of man, and the Origin of Evil") which was directed mainly against Bayle. He argued that this is the [[best of all possible worlds]] that God could have created.

Imitating the example of Leibniz, other philosophers also called their treatises on the problem of evil theodicies. [[Voltaire]]'s popular novel ''[[Candide]]'' mocked Leibnizian optimism through the fictional tale of a naive youth.

=== Thomas Robert Malthus ===
The population and economic theorist [[Thomas Malthus]] stated in a 1798 essay that people with health problems or disease are not suffering, and should not viewed as such. Malthus argued, "Nothing can appear more consonant to our reason than that those beings which come out of the creative process of the world in lovely and beautiful forms should be crowned with immortality, while those which come out misshapen, those whose minds are not suited to a purer and happier state of existence, should perish and be condemned to mix again with their original clay. Eternal condemnation of this kind may be considered as a species of eternal punishment, and it is not wonderful that it should be represented, sometimes, under images of suffering."&lt;ref&gt;Malthus T.R. 1798. An essay on the principle of population. Oxford World's Classics reprint. p158&lt;/ref&gt;

Malthus believed in the Supreme Creator, considered suffering as justified, and suggested that God should be considered "as pursuing the creatures that had offended him with eternal hate and torture, instead of merely condemning to their original insensibility those beings that, by the operation of general laws, had not been formed with qualities suited to a purer state of happiness."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Malthus (1798), [http://www.esp.org/books/malthus/population/malthus.pdf An essay on the principle of population], Oxford Classics, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immanuel Kant===
[[Immanuel Kant]] wrote an essay on theodicy.&lt;ref name=dembski11&gt;[http://www.designinference.com/documents/2003.04.CTNS_theodicy.pdf Making the Task of Theodicy Impossible?], William Dembski (2003), Baylor University, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; He suggested, states William Dembski, that any successful theodicy must prove one of three things: [1] what one deems contrary to the purposefulness of world is not so; [2] if one deems it is contrary, then one must consider it not as a positive fact, but inevitable consequence of the nature of things; [3] if one accepts that it is a positive fact, then one must posit that it is not the work of God, but of some other beings such as man or superior spirits, good or evil.&lt;ref name=dembski11/&gt;

Kant did not attempt or exhaust all theodicies to help address the problem of evil. He claimed there is a reason all possible theodicies must fail.&lt;ref&gt;See Kant's essay, "Concerning the Possibility of a Theodicy and the Failure of All Previous Philosophical Attempts in the Field" (1791). Stephen Palmquist explains why Kant refuses to solve the problem of evil in "Faith in the Face of Evil", Appendix VI of [http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/ksp2 Kant's Critical Religion] (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; While a successful philosophical theodicy has not been achieved in his time, added Kant, there is no basis for a successful anti-theodicy either.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.designinference.com/documents/2003.04.CTNS_theodicy.pdf Making the Task of Theodicy Impossible?], William Dembski (2003), Baylor University, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

===Problem of good===
Several philosophers&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3327264] Cahn, Stephen M. (1977). Cacodaemony. Analysis, Vol. 37, No. 2, pp. 69–73.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=7247672&amp;jid=RES&amp;volumeId=-1&amp;issueId=-1&amp;aid=7247664&amp;fromPage=cupadmin&amp;pdftype=6316268&amp;repository=authInst]  Law, Stephen (2010). The Evil-God Challenge. Religious Studies 46 (3): 353–73&lt;/ref&gt; have argued that just as there exists a problem of evil for theists who believe in an omniscient, omnipotent and omnibenevolent being, so too is there a problem of good for anyone who believes in an omniscient, omnipotent, and omnimalevolent (or perfectly evil) being. As it appears that the defenses and theodicies which might allow the theist to resist the problem of evil can be inverted and used to defend belief in the omnimalevolent being, this suggests that we should draw similar conclusions about the success of these defensive strategies. In that case, the theist appears to face a dilemma: either to accept that both sets of responses are equally bad, and so that the theist does not have an adequate response to the problem of evil; or to accept that both sets of responses are equally good, and so to commit to the existence of an omnipotent, omniscient, and omnimalevolent being as plausible.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Critics have noted that theodicies and defenses are often addressed to the logical problem of evil. As such, they are intended only to demonstrate that it is ''possible'' that evil can co-exist with an omniscient, omnipotent and omnibenevolent being. Since the relevant parallel commitment is only that good can co-exist with an omniscient, omnipotent and omnimalevolent being, not that it is plausible that they should do so, the theist who is responding to the problem of evil need not be committing himself to something he is likely to think is false.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3327697 Cacodaemony and Devilish Isomorphism], King-Farlow, J. (1978), Cacodaemony and Devilish Isomorphism, Analysis, Vol. 38, No. 1, pp. 59–61.&lt;/ref&gt; This reply, however, leaves the evidential problem of evil untouched.

===Morality===
Another general criticism is that though a theodicy may harmonize God with the existence of evil, it does so at the cost of nullifying morality. This is because most theodicies assume that whatever evil there is exists because it is required for the sake of some greater good. But if an evil is necessary because it secures a greater good, then it appears we humans have no duty to prevent it, for in doing so we would also prevent the greater good for which the evil is required. Even worse, it seems that any action can be rationalized, as if one succeeds in performing it, then God has permitted it, and so it must be for the greater good. From this line of thought one may conclude that, as these conclusions violate our basic moral intuitions, no greater good theodicy is true, and God does not exist. Alternatively, one may point out that greater good theodicies lead us to see every conceivable state of affairs as compatible with the existence of God, and in that case the notion of God's goodness is rendered meaningless.&lt;ref&gt;Dittman, Volker and Tremblay, François {{cite web|title=The Immorality of Theodicies

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22514">In [[metaphysics]], the '''problem of universals''' refers to the question of whether properties exist, and if so, what they are.&lt;ref name="Moreland, Universals"&gt;{{cite book|last=Moreland|first=J.P.|title=Universals|year=2001|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press|isbn=0773522697|pages=184}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[property (philosophy)|Properties]] are qualities or relations that two or more entities have in common. The various kinds of properties, such as qualities and [[relation (philosophy)|relations]], are referred to as [[Universal (metaphysics)|universals]]. For instance, one can imagine three cup holders on a table that have in common the quality of ''being circular'' or ''exemplifying circularity'',&lt;ref&gt;Loux (1998), p. 20; (2001), p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; or two daughters that have in common ''being the female offsprings of Frank.'' There are many such properties, such as being human, red, male or female, liquid, big or small, taller than, father of, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Loux (2001), p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

While philosophers agree that human beings talk and think about properties, they disagree on whether these universals exist in [[reality]] or merely in thought and speech.

==Positions&lt;!--'Extreme realism' and 'Strong realism' redirect here--&gt;==
There are many philosophical positions regarding universals. Taking "beauty" as example, three positions are:
* [[Platonic realism]]: beauty is a property that exists in an ideal form independently of any mind or description.
* [[Aristotelian realism]]: beauty is a property that exists only when beautiful things exist.
* [[Anti-realism]]: beauty is a property constructed in the mind, so exists only in descriptions of things.

The main positions above are also called "'''extreme realism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;", "'''strong realism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;", and "[[anti-realism]]" respectively.&lt;ref name="IEP"&gt;MacLeod &amp; Rubenstein (2006), §3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Hochberg, "Nominalism and Idealism," ''Axiomathes'', June 2013, '''23'''(2), pp. 213–234.&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[metaphysical realism]].)

Extreme realism and strong realism are also known as [[exaggerated realism]] and [[moderate realism]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/Nominalism, Realism, Conceptualism|Nominalism, Realism, Conceptualism – ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' (1913)]]&lt;/ref&gt; A notable variant of anti-realism is [[nominalism]].&lt;ref name="IEP" /&gt;

===Realism&lt;!--Linked from 'Philosophical realism'--&gt;===
{{main|Metaphysical realism}}
The realist school claims that universals are real—they exist and are distinct from the particulars that instantiate them. There are various forms of realism. Two major forms are [[Platonic realism]] (''universalia ante res'') and [[Aristotelian realism]] (''universalia in rebus'').&lt;ref&gt;Price (1953), among others, sometimes uses such Latin terms.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Platonic realism'' is the view that universals are real entities and they exist independent of particulars. ''Aristotelian realism'', on the other hand, is the view that universals are real entities, but their existence is dependent on the particulars that exemplify them.

Realists tend to argue that universals must be posited as distinct entities in order to account for various phenomena. For example, a common realist argument, arguably found in Plato, is that universals are required for certain general words to have meaning and for the sentences in which they occur to be true or false. Take the sentence "[[Djivan Gasparyan]] is a musician". The realist may claim that this sentence is only meaningful and expresses a truth because there is an individual, Djivan Gasparyan, who possesses a certain quality: musicianship. Thus it is assumed that the property is a universal which is distinct from the particular individual who has the property.&lt;ref&gt;(MacLeod &amp; Rubenstein, 2006, §1b)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nominalism&lt;!--&lt;!--linked from 'Anti-realism'--&gt;===
{{main|Nominalism}}
Nominalists assert that only individuals or particulars exist and deny that universals are real (i.e. that they exist as entities or beings; ''universalia post res''). The term "nominalism" comes from the Latin ''nomen'' ("name"), since the nominalist philosopher agrees that we predicate the same property of multiple entities but argues that the entities only share a name, not a real quality, in common. There are various forms of nominalism; four major varieties are [[predicate nominalism]], [[resemblance nominalism]], [[trope nominalism]], and [[conceptualism]].&lt;ref name="IEP"/&gt; 

Nominalists often argue for their view by claiming that nominalism can account for all the relevant phenomena, and therefore—by [[Occam's razor]] or some sort of principle of simplicity—nominalism is preferable, since it posits fewer entities.

Nominalism has been endorsed or defended by many, including [[Chrysippus]],&lt;ref&gt;John Sellars, ''Stoicism'', Routledge, 2014, pp. 84–85: "[Stoics] have often been presented as the first nominalists, rejecting the existence of universal concepts altogether. ... For Chrysippus there are no universal entities, whether they be conceived as substantial [[Platonic Forms]] or in some other manner.".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.iep.utm.edu/chrysipp/ Chrysippus (Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]&lt;/ref&gt; [[William of Ockham]], [[Rudolf Carnap]],&lt;ref name=:0&gt;[https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/resemblance-nominalism-a-solution-to-the-problem-of-universals/ "Review of Gonzalo Rodriguez-Pereyra, ''Resemblance Nominalism: A Solution to the Problem of Universals''" – ndpr.nd.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nelson Goodman]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/goodman/supplement.html "Nelson Goodman: The Calculus of Individuals in its different versions", Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]],&lt;ref name=:0/&gt; [[H. H. Price]],&lt;ref name=:0/&gt; and [[D. C. Williams]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/williams-dc/ Donald Cary Williams, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transcendental idealism===
{{main|Transcendental idealism}}
{{see also|German idealism}}

[[Transcendental idealist]] philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] posited that universals are not real, but are ideas in the mind of rational beings. Transcendental idealists do not reject universals as arbitrary names; rather, they treat universals as fundamental categories of pure reason (or as secondary concepts derived from those fundamental categories). Universals, in transcendental idealism, are intrinsically tied to the rationality of the subject making the judgment.

Thus, for transcendental idealists, the problem of universals is only tangentially a metaphysical problem; it is more of a problem of [[psychology]] and [[epistemology]]. Kant's position has been interpreted as a conceptualist one.&lt;ref&gt;Oberst, Michael. 2015. "Kant on Universals." ''History of Philosophy Quarterly'' '''32'''(4):335–352.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient philosophy==

===Plato===
[[Plato]] believed there to be a sharp distinction between the world of perceivable objects and the world of universals or [[substantial form|forms]]: one can only have mere opinions about the former, but one can have [[knowledge]] about the latter.  For Plato it was not possible to have knowledge of anything that could change or was particular, since knowledge had to be forever unfailing and general.&lt;ref&gt;MacLeod &amp; Rubenstein (2006), §1b.&lt;/ref&gt;  For that reason, the world of the forms is the real world, like [[Allegory of the cave|sunlight]], while the sensible world is only imperfectly or partially real, like [[Allegory of the cave|shadows]]. This [[Platonic realism]], however, in denying that the [[theory of forms|eternal Forms]] are mental artifacts, differs sharply with modern forms of idealism.

One of the first nominalist critiques of Plato's realism was that of [[Diogenes of Sinope]], who said "I've seen Plato's cups and table, but not his cupness and tableness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davenport|first=Guy|others=Translated by Guy Davenport|title=Herakleitos and Diogenes|publisher=Grey Fox Press|location=Bolinas|year=1979|pages=57|isbn=0-912516-35-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aristotle===
{{main|Aristotle's theory of universals}}

Plato's student [[Aristotle]] disagreed with his tutor. Aristotle transformed Plato's forms into "[[Four causes#Formal cause|formal causes]]", the blueprints or [[essence]]s of individual things. Whereas Plato idealized [[geometry]], Aristotle emphasized [[Nature (philosophy)|nature]] and related disciplines and therefore much of his thinking concerns living beings and their properties. The nature of universals in Aristotle's philosophy therefore hinges on his view of [[natural kind]]s.

Consider for example a particular [[oak]] tree. This is a member of a species and it has much in common with other oak trees, past, present and future. Its universal, its oakness, is a part of it. A biologist can study oak trees and learn about oakness and more generally the intelligible order within the sensible world. Accordingly, Aristotle was more confident than Plato about coming to know the sensible world; he was a prototypical [[Empiricism|empiricist]] and a founder of [[Inductive reasoning|induction]]. Aristotle was a new, [[Moderate realism|moderate]] sort of realist about universals.

==Medieval philosophy==

===Boethius===
The problem was introduced to the medieval world by [[Boethius]], by his translation of [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]]'s [[Isagoge]]. It begins:

"I shall omit to speak about genera and species, as to whether they subsist (in the nature of things) or in mere conceptions only; whether also if subsistent, they are bodies or incorporeal, and whether they are separate from, or in, sensibles, and subsist about these, for such a treatise is most profound, and requires another more extensive investigation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/porphyry_isagogue_02_translation.htm|title=Porphyry, Introduction (or Isagoge) to the logical Categories of Aristotle (1853) vol. 2. pp.609-633.|first=|last=Porphyry|date=|website=www.tertullian.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Duns Scotus===
[[Duns Scotus]] argued strongly against both nominalism and conceptualism, arguing instead for [[Scotist realism]], a medieval response to the conceptualism of Abelard.

===Ockham===
[[William of Ockham]] argued strongly that universals are a product of abstract human thought. According to Ockham, universals are just words/names that only exist in the mind and have no real place in the external world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2016/entries/ockham/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Spade|first=Paul Vincent|last2=Panaccio|first2=Claude|date=2016-01-01|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Winter 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval realism===
{{main|Medieval realism}}
Realism was argued for by both [[Thomas Aquinas]] and [[Duns Scotus]]. Aquinas argued that both the essence of a thing and its existence were clearly distinct;&lt;ref&gt;On Being and Essence, Ch I.&lt;/ref&gt; in this regard he is close to the teaching of Aristotle. [[Scotist realism]] argues that in a thing there is no real distinction between the essence and the existence, instead there is only a [[Formal distinction]].&lt;ref&gt;Opus Oxoniense I iii 1-2&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these opinions were denied by Scotus' pupil William of Ockham.

===Medieval nominalism===
{{main|Medieval nominalism}}
In [[medieval philosophy]], the French philosopher and [[Theology|theologian]] [[Roscellinus]] (c. 1050 – c. 1125) was an early, prominent proponent of nominalism.

==Modern and contemporary philosophy==

===Mill===
{{also|Psychologism}}
The 19th-century British philosophy [[John Stuart Mill]] discussed the problem of universals in the course of a book that eviscerated the philosophy of Sir [[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|William Hamilton]]. Mill wrote, "The formation of a concept does not consist in separating the attributes which are said to compose it from all other attributes of the same object and enabling us to conceive those attributes, disjoined from any others. We neither conceive them, nor think them, nor cognize them in any way, as a thing apart, but solely as forming, in combination with numerous other attributes, the idea of an individual object".

However, he then proceeds to state that Berkeley's position is factually wrong by stating the following:

{{Quotation |But, though meaning them only as part of a larger agglomeration, we have the power of fixing our attention on them, to the neglect of the other attributes with which we think them combined. While the concentration of attention lasts, if it is sufficiently intense, we may be temporarily unconscious of any of the other attributes and may really, for a brief interval, have nothing present to our mind but the attributes constituent of the concept.|as quoted in William James|''[[The Principles of Psychology]]'' (1890)|}}

In other words, we may be "temporarily unconscious" of whether an image is white, black or yellow and concentrate our attention on the fact that it is a man and on just those attributes necessary to identify it as a man (but not as any particular one). It may then have the significance of a universal of manhood.

===Peirce===
The 19th-century American logician [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], known as the father of [[pragmatism]], developed his own views on the problem of universals in the course of a review of an edition of the writings of George Berkeley. Peirce begins with the observation that "Berkeley's [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] theories have at first sight an air of paradox and levity very unbecoming to a bishop".&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C.S. (1871), Review: Fraser's Edition of the ''Works of George Berkeley'' in ''North American Review'' 113(October):449-72, reprinted in ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#CP|Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce]]'' v. 8, paragraphs 7-38 and in ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#W|Writings of Charles S. Peirce]]'' v. 2, pp. 462-486. ''Peirce Edition Project'' [http://www.iupui.edu/~peirce/writings/v2/w2/w2_48/v2_48.htm Eprint].&lt;/ref&gt; He includes among these paradoxical doctrines Berkeley's denial of "the possibility of forming the simplest general conception". He wrote that if there is some mental fact that works ''in practice'' the way that a universal would, that fact is a universal. "If I have learned a formula in gibberish which in any way jogs my memory so as to enable me in each single case to act as though I had a general idea, what possible utility is there in distinguishing between such a gibberish... and an idea?" Peirce also held as a matter of [[ontology]] that what he called "thirdness", the more general facts about the world, are extra-mental realities.

===James===
[[William James]] learned pragmatism, this way of understanding an idea by its practical effects, from his friend Peirce, but he gave it new significance. (Which was not to Peirce's taste - he came to complain that James had "kidnapped" the term and eventually to call himself a "pragmaticist" instead.) Although James certainly agreed with Peirce and against Berkeley that general ideas exist as a psychological fact, he was a nominalist in his ontology:

{{Quotation | From every point of view, the overwhelming and portentous character ascribed to universal conceptions is surprising. Why, from Plato and Aristotle, philosophers should have vied with each other in scorn of the knowledge of the particular and in adoration of that of the general, is hard to understand, seeing that the more adorable knowledge ought to be that of the more adorable things and that the things of worth are all concretes and singulars. The only value of universal characters is that they help us, by reasoning, to know new [[truth]]s about individual things.|William James|''[[The Principles of Psychology]]'' (1890)|}}

There are at least three ways in which a realist might try to answer James' challenge of explaining the reason why universal conceptions are more lofty than those of particulars:  the moral/political answer, the mathematical/scientific answer, and the anti-paradoxical answer. Each has contemporary or near-contemporary advocates.

===Weaver===
The moral or political response is given by the conservative philosopher [[Richard M. Weaver]] in ''[[Ideas Have Consequences]]'' (1948), where he describes how the acceptance of "the fateful doctrine of nominalism" was "the crucial event in the history of Western culture; from this flowed those acts which issue now in modern decadence".&lt;ref name="Hoeveler1991"&gt;{{cite book|author=J. David Hoeveler|title=Watch on the right: conservative intellectuals in the Reagan era|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JocfGWYGciMC&amp;pg=PA16|accessdate=3 January 2011|date=15 February 1991|publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press|isbn=978-0-299-12810-4|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Scotchie1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph Scotchie|title=The vision of Richard Weaver|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eHUZ7Mjv4WMC&amp;pg=PA112|accessdate=3 January 2011|date=1 January 1995|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-1-56000-212-3|pages=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cocchiarella===
[[Nino Cocchiarella]] put forward the idea that realism is the best response to certain logical paradoxes to which nominalism leads ("Nominalism and Conceptualism as Predicative Second Order Theories of Predication", ''[[Notre Dame Journal of Formal Logic]]'', vol. 21 (1980)). It is noted that in a sense Cocchiarella has adopted Platonism for anti-Platonic reasons. Plato, as seen in the dialogue ''[[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides]]'', was willing to accept a certain amount of paradox with his forms. Cocchiarella adopts the forms to avoid paradox.

===Armstrong===
The Australian philosopher [[David Malet Armstrong]] has been one of the leading realists in the twentieth century, and has used a concept of universals to build a naturalistic and scientifically realist ontology. In both ''Universals and Scientific Realism'' (1978) and ''Universals: An Opinionated Introduction'' (1989), Armstrong describes the relative merits of a number of nominalist theories which appeal either to "natural classes" (a view he ascribes to [[Anthony Quinton, Baron Quinton|Anthony Quinton]]), concepts, resemblance relations or predicates, and also discusses non-realist "trope" accounts (which he describes in the ''Universals and Scientific Realism'' volumes as "particularism"). He gives a number of reasons to reject all of these, but also dismisses a number of realist accounts.

===Penrose===
[[Roger Penrose]] contends that the [[philosophy of mathematics|foundations of mathematics]] can't be understood absent the Platonic view that "mathematical truth is absolute, external and eternal, and not based on man-made criteria ... mathematical objects have a timeless existence of their own..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Penrose|first1=Roger|title=The Emperor's New Mind: Concerning Computers, Minds, and the Laws of Physics|date=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780198519737|page=151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1975">'''Reconstructivism''' is a [[philosophical theory]] holding that societies should continually reform themselves in order to establish more perfect governments or [[social network]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.articleworld.org/index.php/Reconstructivism |title=Articleworld.org |accessdate=2008-04-26 |format=php |work=Reconstructivism }}&lt;/ref&gt; This ideology involves recombining or [[Recontextualisation|recontextualizing]] the ideas arrived at by the philosophy of [[deconstruction]], in which an existing system or medium is broken into its smallest meaningful elements and in which these elements are used to build a new system or medium  free from the strictures of the original.

Some thinkers have attempted to ascribe the term Reconstructivism to the post-postmodern art movement. In an essay by Chris Sunami, ([http://kitoba.com/pedia/Reconstructivist+Art.html Art Essays: Reconstructivist Art]) "reconstructivist art" is described as follows:

{{quote|A reconstructivist art work builds upon prior, [[deconstructionist]] artworks and techniques, but adapts them to classic themes and structures, with the goal of creating works of genuine emotion and significance. In this way, reconstructivism (when it works) combines the vitality and originality of deconstructionism with the comforts, pleasures and rewards of [[classicism]]. The overall purpose of reconstructivism is to reawaken a sense of the Real in a world where everything has been demonstrated to be an illusion.}}

One of the examples Sunami provides of this technique is the way some modern music incorporates deconstructed samples of older music and combines and arranges the samples in a new way as part of a new composition.

The '''Society for Women in Philosophy''' was created in 1972 to support and promote women in philosophy. Since that time the Society for Women in Philosophy or "SWIP" has expanded to many branches around the world, including in the US, Canada, Ireland, the UK, the Netherlands, Flanders, and Germany. SWIP organizations worldwide hold meetings and lectures that aim to support women in philosophy; some, such as SWIPshop, focus exclusively on feminist philosophy, while others, such as SWIP-Analytic, focus on women philosophers working in other areas.&lt;ref name="uh.edu"&gt;SWIP Website http://www.uh.edu/~cfreelan/SWIP/hist.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://swipanalytic.commons.gc.cuny.edu/about/ About - SWIP-Analytic Workshop Series&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nyswip.tumblr.com/ New York Society for Women in Philosophy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the founding members of the Society for Women in Philosophy was [[Alison Jaggar]], who was also one of the first people to introduce feminist concerns into philosophy.&lt;ref name=apacsw&gt;{{cite web|last=DeSautels|first=Peggy|title=Alison Jaggar: April 2013|url=http://www.apaonlinecsw.org/home/woman_philosopher/alisonjaggarapril2013|work=Highlighted Philosophers|publisher=American Philosophical Association|accessdate=18 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each year, one philosopher is named the Distinguished Woman Philosopher of the Year by the Society for Women in Philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2013/03/call-for-nominations-distinguished-woman-philosopher-2013-kukla.html Leiter Reports: A Philosophy Blog: Call for Nominations: Distinguished Woman Philosopher 2013 (Kukla)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archive==

Some SWIP archive records were originally housed in the Sophia Smith Collection at the [[Smith College]] library (started in 1982 by Kathy Pyne Parsons Addelson following the 10th anniversary of SWIP). The official SWIP Archive will now be permanently housed in the Feminist Theory Archive, Pembroke Center, [[Brown University]]. The new SWIP home is the product of the efforts of the Feminist Philosophy Archive Project created in June 2013 and ending in July 2014. The main goal of the FPA Project team, composed of philosophers Joan Callahan, Ann Garry, Alison Jaggar, Sandra Harding, Christina Rawls, and Samantha Noll, was to locate and organize the best possible professional archive for over four decades of SWIP records to be preserved. As of December 2014, the American Philosophical Association awarded the Feminist Theory Archive, SWIP, and the FPAP organizing team financial assistance to aid in the processing and preservation of SWIP materials donated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = SWIP Donor Information | url = http://www.brown.edu/research/pembroke-center/archives/feminist-theory-archives/swip-donor-information | publisher = [[Brown University]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==

In the 1980s, while a graduate student at the [[City University of New York Graduate Center]], Mary Ellen Waithe, now professor of philosophy and interim director of Women's Studies at [[Cleveland State University]], "came upon a reference to a work by Aegidius Menagius, Historia Mullierum Philosopharum, published in 1690 and 1692. [Waithe] had never heard of any women philosophers prior to the 20th century with the exceptions of Queen Christina of Sweden, known as Descartes' student, and Hildegard von Bingen, who lived in the 12th century." &lt;ref name="amazon.com"&gt;A History of Women Philosophers: Ancient Women Philosophers 600 B.C. - 500 A.D. https://www.amazon.com/History-Women-Philosophers-Ancient-B-C/dp/9024733685&lt;/ref&gt; After she obtained a copy of this book, she discovered that "many of the women [Menagius] listed as philosophers were astronomers, astrologers, gynecologists, or simply relatives of male philosophers. Nevertheless, the list of women alleged to have been philosophers was impressive." &lt;ref name="amazon.com"/&gt; At this point, she decided to "create a team of experts to collaborate with...I placed a notice in the SWIP (Society for Women in Philosophy) Newsletter and received a half-dozen responses from philosophers".&lt;ref name="amazon.com"/&gt; This collaborative project led to the publication of the four-volume ''A History of Women Philosophers'', published 1987-1995, which includes the following sections:

* Volume 1, ''Ancient Women Philosophers'' (1987) 600 BC-500 AD, Aspasia of Miletus, Diotima of Mantinea, Julia Domna, Makrina, and Hypatia of Alexandria.&lt;ref name="amazon.com"/&gt;

At the 2002 conference for Canadian Society for Women in Philosophy, Dr. [[Nancy Tuana]] asserted the evolutionary theory that the clitoris is unnecessary in reproduction and therefore it has been "historically ignored," mainly because of "a fear of pleasure. It is pleasure separated from reproduction. That's the fear". She reasoned that this fear is the cause of the ignorance that veils female sexuality.&lt;ref name="Cairney"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cairney|first=Richard|title=Exploring female sexuality|publisher=ExpressNews|date=October 21, 2002|accessdate=December 21, 2011|url=http://www.expressnews.ualberta.ca/article.cfm?id=3201|archivedate=December 21, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111221175533/http://www.archives.expressnews.ualberta.ca/article/2002/10/3201.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The received view, advanced by [[Stephen Jay Gould]] suggests that [[muscle contraction|muscular contractions]] associated with orgasms pull sperm from the vagina to the [[cervix]], where it is in a better position to reach the egg.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8780">'''Somaesthetics''' is an interdisciplinary field of inquiry aimed at promoting and integrating the theoretical, empirical and practical disciplines related to bodily perception, performance and presentation.

== Etymology ==
The term ‘somaesthetics’ was coined by the American pragmatist philosopher [[Richard Shusterman]] in 1996 through the compounding of “soma”, an expression derived from the Greek word for body, and “[[aesthetics]]”, a word derived from the Greek ''aesthesis'', meaning ‘sensory perception’.&lt;ref&gt;While Shusterman was the first to use 'somaesthetics' in reference to a philosophical discipline, a form of the term had been in use within the neurological sciences as an alternate label for the somatosensory cortex, i.e. the somaesthetic cortex. In American English, this alternate label is usually rendered with a different spelling: somesthetic.&lt;/ref&gt; Shusterman has reported in a number of his works that he chose ‘soma’ over more familiar terms “to avoid problematic associations of body (which can be a lifeless, mindless thing) and flesh (which designates only the fleshly parts of the body and is strongly associated with Christian notions of sin)” and to emphasize that the project “concerns the lived, sentient, purposive body rather than merely a physical body”.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shusterman|first1=Richard|title=Somaesthetics|url=https://www.interaction-design.org/encyclopedia/somaesthetics.html|website=Encyclopedia of Human-Computer Interaction|publisher=Interaction Design Foundation|accessdate=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an amalgamation, ‘somaesthetics’ “implies a project of appreciating and cultivating the body not only as an object that externally displays beauty, sublimity, grace, and other aesthetic qualities, but also as a subjectivity that perceives these qualities and that experiences attendant aesthetic pleasures somatically”.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== Origin and development ==
Somaesthetics as a research project initially arose from the work of Richard Shusterman during the mid-1990s in response to what he perceived as needed developments within his two principal modes of inquiry: pragmatist aesthetics and philosophy as an embodied art of living. While pragmatist aesthetics, according to Shusterman, advocates for more active and creative engagement than traditional aesthetics, he believed it should also recognize that artistic, practical and political action requires humanity’s primary tool, the body, and that such action could be improved partly by improving this instrument.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shusterman|first1=Richard|title=Somaesthetics|url=https://www.interaction-design.org/encyclopedia/somaesthetics.html|website=Encyclopedia of Human-Computer Interaction|publisher=Interaction Design Foundation|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same way, the philosophical life could be improved through greater mastery of the soma -- our medium of living. He moreover lamented the reduction of aesthetics (as well as philosophy itself) from “a noble art of living into a minor, specialized university discipline” narrowly concerned with beauty and fine art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shusterman|first1=Richard|title=Somaesthetics: A Disciplinary Proposal|journal=Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism|date=Summer 1999|volume=57|issue=3|page=301|url=http://www.staff.amu.edu.pl/~ewa/Somaesthetics.pdf|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shusterman thus argued for the revival of “[[Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten|Baumgarten]]’s idea of aesthetics as a life-improving cognitive discipline that extends far beyond questions of beauty and fine arts and that involves both theory and practical exercise” and for an end to “the neglect of the body that Baumgarten disastrously introduced into aesthetics”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=ibid.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As proposed, Shusterman’s project of somaesthetics would restore “the soma — the living, sentient, purposive body — as the indispensable medium for all perception".&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Such heightening of somatic consciousness would not only enhance artistic appreciation and creation, but increase the perceptual awareness of meanings and feelings that have the potential to elevate everyday experience into an art of living.

Shusterman proposed three fundamental dimensions of his emerging field:
&lt;br /&gt;
• Analytic somaesthetics, as the most theoretically-oriented of the three, “describes the basic nature of bodily perceptions and practices and also of their function in our knowledge and construction of reality”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shusterman|first1=Richard|title=Somaesthetics: A Disciplinary Proposal|journal=Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism|date=Summer 1999|volume=57|issue=3|page=304|url=http://www.staff.amu.edu.pl/~ewa/Somaesthetics.pdf|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
• Pragmatic somaesthetics presupposes the analytic dimension and “has a distinctly normative, prescriptive character – by proposing specific methods of somatic improvement and engaging in their comparative critique”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shusterman|first1=Richard|title=Somaesthetics: A Disciplinary Proposal|journal=Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism|date=Summer 1999|volume=57|issue=3|pages=304–305|url=http://www.staff.amu.edu.pl/~ewa/Somaesthetics.pdf|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
• Practical somaesthetics focuses on practicing somatic care “through intelligently disciplined body work aimed at somatic self-improvement (whether in a representational, experiential, or performative mode)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shusterman|first1=Richard|title=Somaesthetics: A Disciplinary Proposal|journal=Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism|date=Summer 1999|volume=57|issue=3|page=307|url=http://www.staff.amu.edu.pl/~ewa/Somaesthetics.pdf|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the past two decades, somaesthetics has become a truly interdisciplinary endeavor. Originally conceived by Shusterman as being under the umbrella of [[philosophy]], or perhaps even a branch of [[aesthetics]], somaesthetics has evolved into an “open field for collaborative, interdisciplinary, and transcultural inquiry” with applications “ranging from the arts, product design, and politics to fashion, health, sports, martial arts, and the use of hallucinogenic drugs in education”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shusterman|first1=Richard|title=Somaesthetics|url=https://www.interaction-design.org/encyclopedia/somaesthetics.html#heading_Genealogy_and_Emergence_page_107797|website=Encyclopedia of Human-Computer Interaction|publisher=Interaction Design Foundation|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Paolo Monti - Servizio fotografico (Napoli, 1969) - BEIC 6353768.jpg|thumb|[[Zeno of Citium]], bust in the [[Farnese collection]], Naples – Photo by [[Paolo Monti]], 1969.]]

'''Stoicism''' is a school of [[Hellenistic philosophy]] founded by [[Zeno of Citium]] in Athens in the early 3rd century BC. It was heavily influenced by certain teachings of [[Socrates]], while [[Stoic physics]] are largely drawn from the teachings of the philosopher [[Heraclitus]]. Stoicism is predominantly a philosophy of personal ethics informed by its system of logic and its views on the natural world. According to its teachings, as social beings, the path to happiness for humans is found in accepting the moment as it presents itself, by not allowing oneself to be controlled by the desire for pleasure or fear of pain, by using one’s mind to understand the world and to do one’s part in nature's plan, and by working together and treating others fairly and justly.

The Stoics are especially known for teaching that "virtue is the only good" for human beings, and that external things—such as health, wealth, and pleasure—are not good or bad in themselves, but have value as "material for virtue to act upon".  Alongside [[Aristotelian ethics]], the Stoic tradition forms one of the major founding approaches to Western [[virtue ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;Sharpe, Matthew. "[http://dro.deakin.edu.au/eserv/DU:30059463/sharpe-stoicvirtue-2013.pdf Stoic Virtue Ethics]." ''Handbook of Virtue Ethics'', 2013, 28–41.&lt;/ref&gt; The Stoics also held that certain destructive emotions resulted from errors of judgment, and they believed people should aim to maintain a will (called ''[[prohairesis]]'') that is "in accord with nature". Because of this, the Stoics thought the best indication of an individual's philosophy was not what a person said, but how a person behaved.&lt;ref&gt;John Sellars. ''Stoicism'', 2006, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; To live a good life, one had to understand the rules of the natural order since they thought everything was rooted in nature.

Many Stoics—such as [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] and [[Epictetus]]—emphasized that because "virtue is sufficient for [[Philosophy of happiness|happiness]]", a [[Sage (philosophy)|sage]] would be emotionally resilient to misfortune. This belief is similar to the meaning of the phrase "stoic calm", though the phrase does not include the "radical ethical" Stoic views that only a sage can be considered truly free, and that all moral corruptions are equally vicious.&lt;ref name="Stoicism"&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/stoicism/ Stoicism], Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Stoicism flourished throughout the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] and [[Roman Greece|Greek]] world until the 3rd century AD, and among its adherents was Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]]. It experienced a decline after Christianity became the state religion in the 4th century AD. Since then it has seen revivals, notably in the [[Renaissance philosophy|Renaissance]] ([[Neostoicism]]) and in the modern era ([[modern Stoicism]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Becker|first1=Lawrence C.|author-link=Lawrence C. Becker|title=A New Stoicism|date=2001|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|location=Princeton|isbn=9781400822447|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NbqFt3RPsuQC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
Stoic comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''stōïkos'', meaning "of the stoa [portico, or porch]". This, in turn, refers to the [[Stoa Poikile]], or "Painted Stoa," in Athens, where the influential Stoic [[Zeno of Citium]] taught.&lt;ref name="etymologymerriam"&gt;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/stoic&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Williamson2015"&gt;{{cite book|last=Williamson|first=D.|title=Kant's Theory of Emotion: Emotional Universalism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=62WCDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA17|date=1 April 2015|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan US|isbn=978-1-137-49810-6|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In laymen's terms stoicism is sometimes referred to as "suffering in silence", and the ethics associated with that.&lt;ref&gt;Yong, Hua‐Hie. "Can attitudes of stoicism and cautiousness explain observed age‐related variation in levels of self‐rated pain, mood disturbance and functional interference in chronic pain patients?." European Journal of Pain 10.5 (2006): 399–399.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic tenets==
{{rquote|right|Philosophy does not promise to secure anything external for man, otherwise it would be admitting something that lies beyond its proper subject-matter. For as the material of the carpenter is wood, and that of statuary bronze, so the subject-matter of the art of living is each person's own life.|Epictetus|''[[Discourses of Epictetus|Discourses]]'' 1.15.2, Robin Hard revised translation}}

The Stoics provided a unified account of the world, consisting of formal [[logic]], [[monism|monistic]] [[physics]] and [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]] ethics. Of these, they emphasized ethics as the main focus of human knowledge, though their logical theories were of more interest for later philosophers.

Stoicism teaches the development of self-control and fortitude as a means of overcoming destructive [[emotion]]s; the philosophy holds that becoming a clear and unbiased thinker allows one to understand the universal reason (''[[logos]]''). A primary aspect of Stoicism involves improving the individual's ethical and moral well-being: "''Virtue'' consists in a ''will'' that is in agreement with Nature."&lt;ref name="Russell"&gt;Russell, Bertrand. ''A History of Western Philosophy,'' p. 254&lt;/ref&gt; This principle also applies to the realm of interpersonal relationships; "to be free from anger, envy, and jealousy,"&lt;ref name="Russell1"&gt;Russell, Bertrand. ''A History of Western Philosophy'', p. 264&lt;/ref&gt; and to accept even slaves as "equals of other men, because all men alike are products of nature".&lt;ref name="Russell5"&gt;Russell, Bertrand. ''A History of Western Philosophy'', p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Stoic ethic espouses a [[determinism|deterministic]] perspective; in regard to those who lack Stoic virtue, [[Cleanthes]] once opined that the wicked man is "like a dog tied to a cart, and compelled to go wherever it goes".&lt;ref name="Russell" /&gt; A Stoic of virtue, by contrast, would amend his will to suit the world and remain, in the words of Epictetus, "sick and yet happy, in peril and yet happy, dying and yet happy, in exile and happy, in disgrace and happy,"&lt;ref name="Russell1" /&gt; thus positing a "completely autonomous" individual will, and at the same time a universe that is "a rigidly deterministic single whole".  This viewpoint was later described as "[[Classical Pantheism]]" (and was adopted by Dutch philosopher [[Baruch Spinoza]]).&lt;ref&gt;Charles Hartshorne and William Reese, "Philosophers Speak of God," Humanity Books, 1953 ch 4&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Antisthenes Pio-Clementino Inv288.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Antisthenes]], founder of the Cynic school of philosophy]]

Stoicism became the foremost popular philosophy among the educated elite in the Hellenistic world and the Roman Empire,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=These Were the Greeks|last=Amos|first=H.|publisher=Dufour Editions|year=1982|isbn=978-0-8023-1275-4|location=Chester Springs|oclc=9048254}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the point where, in the words of [[Gilbert Murray]] "nearly all the [[diadochi|successors of Alexander]] [...] professed themselves Stoics."&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert Murray, ''The Stoic Philosophy'' (1915), p. 25. In Bertrand Russell, ''A History of Western Philosophy'' (1946).&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning around 301&amp;nbsp;BC, [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]] taught philosophy at the Stoa Poikile ("Painted Porch"), from which his philosophy got its name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Becker | first = Lawrence | title = A History of Western Ethics | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2003 | isbn = 978-0-415-96825-6 |page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the other schools of philosophy, such as the [[Epicureans]], Zeno chose to teach his philosophy in a public space, which was a [[colonnade]] overlooking the central gathering place of Athens, the [[Ancient Agora of Athens|Agora]].

Zeno's ideas developed from those of the [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynics]], whose founding father, [[Antisthenes]], had been a disciple of [[Socrates]]. Zeno's most influential follower was [[Chrysippus]], who was responsible for the molding of what is now called Stoicism. Later Roman Stoics focused on promoting a life in harmony within the universe, over which one has no direct control.

[[File:Seneca-berlinantikensammlung-1.jpg|thumb|right|Bust of Seneca]] 
Scholars usually divide the history of Stoicism into three phases:
* Early Stoa, from the founding of the school by Zeno to [[Antipater of Tarsus|Antipater]].
* Middle Stoa, including [[Panaetius]] and [[Posidonius]].
* Late Stoa, including [[Gaius Musonius Rufus|Musonius Rufus]], [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], [[Epictetus]], and [[Marcus Aurelius]].

No complete work by any Stoic philosopher survives from the first two phases of Stoicism. Only Roman texts from the Late Stoa survive.&lt;ref&gt;A.A.Long, ''Hellenistic Philosophy'', p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Logic==
{{Main|Stoic logic}}
===Propositional logic===
[[Diodorus Cronus]], who was one of Zeno's teachers, is considered the philosopher who first introduced and developed an approach to logic now known as [[propositional logic]], which is based on statements or propositions, rather than terms, making it very different from Aristotle's [[term logic]]. Later, [[Chrysippus]] developed a system that became known as Stoic logic and included a deductive system, Stoic Syllogistic, which was considered a rival to Aristotle's Syllogistic (see [[Syllogism]]). New interest in Stoic logic came in the 20th&amp;nbsp;century, when important developments in logic were based on propositional logic. [[Susanne Bobzien]] wrote, "The many close similarities between Chrysippus' philosophical logic and that of [[Gottlob Frege]] are especially striking."&lt;ref name=SEP&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-ancient/ ''Ancient Logic''] by [[Susanne Bobzien]]. Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bobzien also notes that "Chrysippus wrote over 300 books on logic, on virtually any topic logic today concerns itself with, including [[speech act]] theory, sentence analysis, singular and plural expressions, types of [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicates]], [[Indexicality|indexicals]], [[Existential quantification|existential propositions]], [[Logical connective|sentential connectives]], [[negation]]s, [[Logical disjunction|disjunctions]], [[Conditional proof|conditionals]], [[logical consequence]], [[validity (logic)|valid argument]] forms, [[Deductive reasoning|theory of deduction]], propositional logic, [[modal logic]], [[tense logic]], [[epistemic logic]], [[Supposition theory|logic of suppositions]], [[Imperative logic|logic of imperatives]], ambiguity and logical [[paradox]]es."&lt;ref name=SEP/&gt;

===Categories===
{{Main article|Stoic categories}}

The Stoics held that all [[being]] (ὄντα) – though not all things (τινά) – is [[Matter|material]]. They accepted the distinction between [[Abstract and concrete]] bodies, but rejected [[Aristotle]]'s belief that purely [[incorporeality|incorporeal]] being exists. Thus, they accepted [[Anaxagoras]]' idea (as did Aristotle) that if an object is hot, it is because some part of a universal heat body had entered the object. But, unlike Aristotle, they extended the idea to cover all [[Accident (philosophy)|accidents]]. Thus if an object is red, it would be because some part of a universal red body had entered the object.

They held that there were four [[Stoic categories|categories]].
* '''[[Substance theory|substance]] (ὑποκείμενον)'''
::The primary matter, formless substance, (''ousia'') that things are made of
* '''[[Quality (philosophy)|quality]] (ποιόν)'''
::The way matter is organized to form an individual object; in Stoic physics, a physical ingredient (''pneuma'': air or breath), which informs the matter
*'''somehow disposed (πως ἔχον)'''
::Particular characteristics, not present within the object, such as size, shape, action, and posture{{Rquote|right|Make for yourself a definition or description of the thing which is presented to you, so as to see distinctly what kind of a thing it is in its substance, in its nudity, in its complete entirety, and tell yourself its proper name, and the names of the things of which it has been compounded, and into which it will be resolved. For nothing is so productive of elevation of mind as to be able to examine methodically and truly every object that is presented to you in life, and always to look at things so as to see at the same time what kind of universe this is, and what kind of use everything performs in it, and what value everything has with reference to the whole.|Marcus Aurelius|''[[Meditations]]'', iii. 11}}
*'''Somehow disposed in relation to something (πρός τί πως ἔχον)'''
::Characteristics related to other phenomena, such as the position of an object within time and space relative to other objects

===Epistemology===
The Stoics propounded that [[knowledge]] can be attained through the use of [[reason]]. [[Truth]] can be distinguished from [[fallacy]]—even if, in practice, only an approximation can be made. According to the Stoics, the [[sense]]s constantly receive sensations: pulsations that pass from objects through the senses to the [[mind]], where they leave an impression in the [[imagination]] (phantasia) (an impression arising from the mind was called a phantasma).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Diogenes Laërtius | author-link = Diogenes Laërtius | year = 2000 | title = Lives of eminent philosophers | publisher = [[Harvard University Press]] | location = Cambridge, MA}} VII.49&lt;/ref&gt;

The mind has the ability to judge (συγκατάθεσις, ''synkatathesis'')—approve or reject—an impression, enabling it to distinguish a true representation of reality from one that is false. Some impressions can be assented to immediately, but others can only achieve varying degrees of hesitant approval, which can be labeled [[belief]] or opinion (''[[doxa]]''). It is only through reason that we gain clear comprehension and conviction (''[[katalepsis]]''). [[Certain]] and true knowledge (''[[episteme]]''), achievable by the Stoic sage, can be attained only by verifying the conviction with the expertise of one's peers and the collective judgment of humankind.

==Metaphysics==
The first philosophers to explicitly describe [[Nominalism|nominalist]] arguments were the Stoics, especially Chrysippus.&lt;ref&gt;John Sellars, ''Stoicism'', Routledge, 2014, pp. 84–85: "[Stoics] have often been presented as the first nominalists, rejecting the existence of universal concepts altogether. ... For Chrysippus there are no universal entities, whether they be conceived as substantial [[Platonic Forms]] or in some other manner.".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.iep.utm.edu/chrysipp/ Chrysippus – Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physics, theology and cosmology==
{{main article|Stoic physics}}
{{See also|De Mundo}}
According to the Stoics, the [[Universe]] is a material, reasoning substance, known as God or [[Nature]], which the Stoics divided into two classes, the active and the passive. The passive substance is matter, which "lies sluggish, a substance ready for any use, but sure to remain unemployed if no one sets it in motion".&lt;ref&gt;Seneca, ''Epistles'', lxv. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The active substance, which can be called [[Destiny|Fate]] or Universal Reason (''Logos''), is an intelligent [[Aether (classical element)|aether]] or primordial fire, which acts on the passive matter:
{{quote|The universe itself is God and the universal outpouring of its soul; it is this same world's guiding principle, operating in mind and reason, together with the common nature of things and the totality that embraces all existence; then the foreordained might and necessity of the future; then fire and the principle of aether; then those elements whose natural state is one of flux and transition, such as water, earth, and air; then the sun, the moon, the stars; and the universal existence in which all things are contained.|sign=Chrysippus|source=in Cicero, ''[[De Natura Deorum]]'', i. 39}}

Everything is subject to the laws of Fate, for the Universe acts according to its own nature, and the nature of the passive matter it governs. The [[soul]]s of humans and animals are emanations from this primordial Fire, and are, likewise, subject to Fate:

{{quote|Constantly regard the universe as one living being, having one substance and one soul; and observe how all things have reference to one perception, the perception of this one living being; and how all things act with one movement; and how all things are the cooperating causes of all things that exist; observe too the continuous spinning of the thread and the structure of the web.|sign=Marcus Aurelius|source=''[[Meditations]]'', iv. 40}}

Individual souls are perishable by nature, and can be "transmuted and diffused, assuming a fiery nature by being received into the ''seminal reason'' ("[[logos spermatikos]]") of the Universe".&lt;ref&gt;Marcus Aurelius, ''Meditations'', iv. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Since right Reason is the foundation of both humanity and the universe, it follows that the goal of life is to live according to Reason, that is, to live a life according to [[Natural law|Nature]].

Stoic theology is a [[Fatalism|fatalistic]] and [[naturalistic pantheism]]: God is never fully transcendent but always [[Immanence|immanent]], and identified with [[Nature]]. [[Abrahamic religions]] personalize God as a world-creating entity, but Stoicism equates God with the totality of the universe; according to Stoic [[cosmology]], which is very similar to the [[Hindu cosmology|Hindu conception of existence]], there is no absolute start to time, as it is considered infinite and cyclic. Similarly, the [[space]] and [[Universe]] have neither start nor end, rather they are cyclical. The current Universe is a phase in the present cycle, preceded by an infinite number of Universes, doomed to be destroyed ("[[Ekpyrosis|ekpyrōsis]]", ''conflagration'') and [[Palingenesis|re-created again]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Lapidge]], ''Stoic Cosmology'', in: John M. Rist, ''The Stoics'', [[Cambridge University Press]], 1978, pp. 182–183.&lt;/ref&gt; and to be followed by another infinite number of Universes. Stoicism considers all [[existence]] as cyclic, the cosmos as eternally self-creating and self-destroying (see also [[Eternal return]]).

Stoicism, just like [[Indian religions]] such as [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]], does not posit a beginning or end to the Universe.&lt;ref name="ferg" /&gt; According to the Stoics, the ''[[logos]]'' was the active [[reason]] or ''[[anima mundi]]'' pervading and animating the entire Universe. It was conceived as material and is usually identified with God or Nature. The Stoics also referred to the ''seminal reason'' ("[[logos spermatikos]]"), or the law of generation in the Universe, which was the principle of the active reason working in inanimate [[matter]]. Humans, too, each possess a portion of the divine ''logos'', which is the primordial Fire and reason that controls and sustains the Universe.&lt;ref&gt;Tripolitis, A., ''Religions of the Hellenistic-Roman Age'', pp. 37–38. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethics and virtues&lt;!--linked from 'Zeno of Citium' and 'Oikeiôsis'--&gt;==
The ancient Stoics are often misunderstood because the terms they used pertained to different concepts in the past than they do today. The word "stoic" has come to mean "unemotional" or indifferent to pain because Stoic ethics taught freedom from "passion" by following "reason". The Stoics did not seek to extinguish emotions; rather, they sought to transform them by a resolute "[[asceticism|askēsis]]" that enables a person to develop clear judgment and inner calm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Graver | first = Margaret | title = Stoicism and Emotion | publisher = [[University of Chicago Press]] | location = Chicago | year = 2009 | isbn = 978-0-226-30558-5 |oclc=430497127}}&lt;/ref&gt; Logic, reflection, and concentration were the methods of such self-discipline.

Borrowing from the Cynics, the foundation of Stoic ethics is that good lies in the state of the soul itself; in wisdom and self-control. Stoic ethics stressed the rule: "Follow where reason leads." {{citationneeded|date=June 2017}} One must therefore strive to be free of the [[Stoic passions|passions]], bearing in mind that the ancient meaning of "passion" was "anguish" or "suffering",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/passion |website=[[Merriam-Webster]] |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |title=Passion |accessdate=29 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is, "passively" reacting to external events, which is somewhat different from the modern use of the word. A distinction was made between ''pathos'' (plural ''pathe'') which is normally translated as ''passion'', ''propathos'' or instinctive reaction (e.g., turning pale and trembling when confronted by physical danger) and ''eupathos'', which is the mark of the Stoic sage (''sophos''). The ''eupatheia'' are feelings that result from correct judgment in the same way that passions result from incorrect judgment.

The idea was to be free of [[suffering]] through ''[[apatheia]]'' (Greek: {{lang|grc|ἀπάθεια}}; literally, "without passion") or [[Inner peace|peace of mind]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Seddon | first = Keith | title = Epictetus' Handbook and the Tablet of Cebes | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2005 | isbn = 978-0-415-32451-9 |page=217 |oclc=469313282}}&lt;/ref&gt; where peace of mind was understood in the ancient sense—being [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] or having "clear judgment" and the maintenance of [[equanimity]] in the face of life's highs and lows.

For the Stoics, reason meant not only using logic, but also understanding the processes of nature—the logos or universal reason, inherent in all things. Living according to reason and virtue, they held, is to live in harmony with the divine order of the universe, in recognition of the common reason and essential value of all people.

The four [[cardinal virtues]] (''[[Arete (moral virtue)|aretai]]'') of Stoic philosophy is a classification derived from the teachings of [[Plato]] (''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' IV. 426–435):
* [[Wisdom]] (σοφία "''sophia''")
* [[Courage]] (ανδρεία "''andreia''")
* [[Justice]] (δικαιοσύνη "''dikaiosyne''")
* [[Temperance (virtue)|Temperance]] (σωφροσύνη ''"[[sophrosyne]]''")

Following Socrates, the Stoics held that unhappiness and [[evil]] are the results of human ignorance of the reason in nature. If someone is unkind, it is because they are unaware of their own universal reason, which leads to the conclusion of unkindness. The solution to evil and unhappiness then is the practice of Stoic philosophy: to examine one's own judgments and behavior and determine where they diverge from the universal reason of nature.

The Stoics accepted that suicide was permissible for the wise person in circumstances that might prevent them from living a virtuous life.&lt;ref name="marietta153"&gt;Don E. Marietta, (1998), ''Introduction to ancient philosophy'', pp. 153–54. Sharpe&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plutarch]] held that accepting life under tyranny would have compromised [[Cato the Younger|Cato]]'s self-consistency (''constantia'') as a Stoic and impaired his freedom to make the honorable moral choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Cato's suicide in Plutarch AV Zadorojnyi|publisher=The Classical Quarterly|year=2007|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0009838807000195|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

===The doctrine of "things indifferent"===
{{main article|Apatheia}}
{{see also|Eudaimonia}}
In philosophical terms, things that are indifferent are outside the application of [[Moral absolutism|moral law]]—that is without tendency to either promote or obstruct moral ends. Actions neither required nor forbidden by the moral law, or that do not affect [[morality]], are called morally indifferent. The doctrine of things indifferent ({{lang|grc|ἀδιάφορα}}, ''[[adiaphora]]'') arose in the Stoic school as a [[corollary]] of its diametric opposition of virtue and vice ({{lang|grc|καθήκοντα}} ''[[kathekon]]'', "convenient actions", or actions in accordance with nature; and ἁμαρτήματα ''hamartemata'', mistakes). As a result of this [[dichotomy]], a large class of objects were left unassigned and thus regarded as indifferent.

Eventually three sub-classes of "things indifferent" developed: things to prefer because they assist life according to nature; things to avoid because they hinder it; and things indifferent in the narrower sense. The principle of ''adiaphora'' was also common to the Cynics. [[Philipp Melanchthon]] revived the doctrine of things indifferent during the [[Renaissance]].

===Spiritual exercise===
[[File:L'Image et le Pouvoir - Buste cuirassé de Marc Aurèle agé - 3.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Marcus Aurelius]], the Stoic Roman emperor]]
Philosophy for a Stoic is not just a set of beliefs or ethical claims, it is a way of life involving constant practice and training (or "[[asceticism|askēsis]]"). Stoic philosophical and spiritual practices included [[History of logic#Stoics|logic]], [[Socratic dialogue]] and [[Introspection|self-dialogue]], [[Mortality salience|contemplation of death]], training attention to remain in the present moment (similar to some forms of [[Buddhist meditation]]), and daily reflection on everyday problems and possible solutions. Philosophy for a Stoic is an active process of constant practice and self-reminder.

In his ''[[Meditations]]'', Marcus Aurelius defines several such practices. For example, in Book II.I:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Say to yourself in the early morning: I shall meet today ungrateful, violent, treacherous, envious, uncharitable men. All of the ignorance of real good and ill... I can neither be harmed by any of them, for no man will involve me in wrong, nor can I be angry with my kinsman or hate him; for we have come into the world to work together...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Prior to Aurelius, Epictetus in his ''[[Discourses of Epictetus|Discourses]],'' distinguished between three types of act: judgment, desire, and inclination.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, A.I. (1995) ''Pierre Hadot and the Spiritual Phenomenon of Ancient Philosophy'', in ''Philosophy as a Way of Life'', Hadot, P. Oxford Blackwells, pp. 9–10&lt;/ref&gt; According to French philosopher [[Pierre Hadot]], Epictetus identifies these three acts with logic, physics and ethics respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Hadot, P. (1992) ''La Citadelle intérieure. Introduction aux Pensées de Marc Aurèle''. Paris, Fayard, pp. 106–15&lt;/ref&gt; Hadot writes that in the ''Meditations'', "Each maxim develops either one of these very characteristic ''topoi'' [i.e., acts], or two of them or three of them."&lt;ref&gt;Hadot, P. (1987) ''Exercices spirituels et philosophie antique''. Paris, 2nd ed., p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

Seamus Mac Suibhne has described the practices of spiritual exercises as influencing those of [[reflective practice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mac Suibhne, S.|year=2009|title='Wrestle to be the man philosophy wished to make you': Marcus Aurelius, reflective practitioner|journal=Reflective Practice|volume=10|issue=4|pages=429–36|doi=10.1080/14623940903138266}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robertson's ''The Philosophy of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy'' details at length parallels between Stoic spiritual exercises and modern [[cognitive behavioral therapy]].&lt;ref name="Robertson_2010"&gt;{{Cite book| author=Robertson, D | title=The Philosophy of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy: Stoicism as Rational and Cognitive Psychotherapy| year=2010| publisher=Karnac| location=London| isbn=978-1-85575-756-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XsOFyJaR5vEC&amp;lpg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stoics were also known for consolatory orations, which were part of the ''[[consolatio]]'' literary tradition.  Three such [[Seneca's Consolations|consolations]] by Seneca have survived.

==Social philosophy==
A distinctive feature of Stoicism is its [[cosmopolitanism]]: All people are manifestations of the one universal spirit and should live in brotherly love and readily help one another according to the Stoics. In the ''[[Discourses of Epictetus|Discourses]]'', [[Epictetus]] comments on man's relationship with the world: "Each human being is primarily a citizen of his own commonwealth; but he is also a member of the great city of gods and men, whereof the city political is only a copy."&lt;ref&gt;Epictetus, ''Discourses'', ii. 5. 26&lt;/ref&gt; This sentiment echoes that of [[Diogenes of Sinope]], who said, "I am not an [[Athens, Greece|Athenian]] or a [[Ancient Corinth|Corinthian]], but a citizen of the world."&lt;ref&gt;Epictetus, ''Discourses'', i. 9. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

They held that external differences such as rank and wealth are of no importance in social relationships. Instead, they advocated the brotherhood of humanity and the natural equality of all human beings. Stoicism became the most influential school of the Greco-Roman world, and produced a number of remarkable writers and personalities, such as [[Cato the Younger]] and Epictetus.

In particular, they were noted for their urging of [[clemency]] toward [[slave]]s. Seneca exhorted, "Kindly remember that he whom you call your slave sprang from the same stock, is smiled upon by the same skies, and on equal terms with yourself breathes, lives, and dies."&lt;ref&gt;[[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], [[s:Moral letters to Lucilius/Letter 47|''Moral letters to Lucilius'', Letter 47: ''On master and slave'']], 10, circa AD 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence on Christianity==
{{See also|Neostoicism}}
[[Image:Justus Lipsius.png|right|thumb|[[Justus Lipsius]], founder of Neostoicism]]
In his Introduction to the 1964 [[Penguin Classics]] edition of ''Meditations'', the Anglican priest Maxwell Staniforth discussed the profound impact Stoicism had on Christianity. He claimed the author of the Fourth Gospel declared Christ to be the Logos, which "had long been one of the leading terms of Stoicism, chosen originally for the purpose of explaining how deity came into relation with the universe".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Marcus Aurelius |authorlink=Marcus Aurelius| title=Meditations |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WV7Teosv0bIC |year=1964 |location=London |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |page=24 |isbn=978-0-140-44140-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In St. Ambrose of Milan's ''Duties'', "The voice is the voice of a Christian bishop, but the precepts are those of [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3401.htm|title=On the Duties of the Clergy|website=www.newadvent.org|access-date=2017-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Aurelius |first=Marcus |authorlink=Marcus Aurelius| title=Meditations |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WV7Teosv0bIC |year=1964 |location=London |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |page=26 |isbn=978-0-140-44140-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding what he called "the Divine Spirit", Stanisforth wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Cleanthes, wishing to give more explicit meaning to Zeno's 'creative fire', had been the first to hit upon the term ''pneuma'', or 'spirit', to describe it. Like fire, this intelligent 'spirit' was imagined as a tenuous substance akin to a current of air or breath, but essentially possessing the quality of warmth; it was immanent in the universe as God, and in man as the soul and life-giving principle. Clearly it is not a long step from this to the 'Holy Spirit' of Christian theology, the 'Lord and Giver of life', visibly manifested as tongues of fire at Pentecost and ever since associated—in the Christian as in the Stoic mind—with the ideas of vital fire and beneficient warmth.&lt;ref name="Marcus Aurelius 1964 25"&gt;{{cite book |last=Marcus Aurelius |authorlink=Marcus Aurelius| title=Meditations |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WV7Teosv0bIC |year=1964 |location=London |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |page=25 |isbn=978-0-140-44140-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Regarding the [[Trinity]], Staniforth wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Again in the doctrine of the Trinity, the ecclesiastical conception of Father, Word, and Spirit finds its germ in the different Stoic names of the Divine Unity. Thus Seneca, writing of the supreme Power which shapes the universe, states, 'This Power we sometimes call the All-ruling God, sometimes the incorporeal Wisdom, sometimes the holy Spirit, sometimes Destiny.' The Church had only to reject the last of these terms to arrive at its own acceptable definition of the Divine Nature; while the further assertion 'these three are One', which the modern mind finds paradoxical, was no more than commonplace to those familiar with Stoic notions.&lt;ref name="Marcus Aurelius 1964 25"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Paul of Tarsus|apostle Paul]] met with Stoics during his stay in Athens, reported in {{bibleverse||Acts|17:16–18|NKJV}}. In his [[Pauline epistles|letters]], Paul reflected heavily from his knowledge of Stoic philosophy, using Stoic terms and metaphors to assist his new [[Gentile]] converts in their understanding of Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Kee, Howard and Franklin W. Young, ''Understanding The New Testament'', Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, Prentice Hall, Inc. 1958, p. 208. {{ISBN|978-0139365911}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stoic influence can also be seen in the works of [[St. Ambrose]], [[Marcus Minucius Felix]], and [[Tertullian]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/topic/Stoicism Encyclopædia Britannica. Stoicism. §''Stoic elements in Pauline and patristic thought'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Fathers of the Church]] regarded Stoicism as a "pagan philosophy";&lt;ref name="Agathias"&gt;[[Agathias]]. ''Histories,'' 2.31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sedley"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=David |first=Sedley |editor=E. Craig |encyclopedia=[[Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |title=Ancient philosophy |url=http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/A130 |accessdate=2008-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; nonetheless, early Christian writers employed some of the central philosophical concepts of Stoicism. Examples include the terms "logos", "[[virtue]]", "[[Spirit]]", and "[[conscience]]".&lt;ref name="ferg"&gt;Ferguson, Everett. ''Backgrounds of Early Christianity''. 2003, p. 368.&lt;/ref&gt; But the parallels go well beyond the sharing and borrowing of terminology. Both Stoicism and Christianity assert an inner freedom in the face of the external world, a belief in human kinship with Nature or God, a sense of the innate depravity—or "persistent evil"—of humankind,&lt;ref name="ferg" /&gt; and the futility and temporary nature of worldly possessions and attachments. Both encourage ''Ascesis'' with respect to the passions and inferior emotions such as lust, and envy, so that the higher possibilities of one's humanity can be awakened and developed.

Stoic writings such as ''[[Meditations]]'' by [[Marcus Aurelius]] have been highly regarded by many Christians throughout the centuries. The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and [[Oriental Orthodox Church]] accept the Stoic ideal of [[Apatheia|dispassion]] to this day.

Middle and Roman Stoics taught that sex is just within marriage, for unitive and procreative purposes only.&lt;ref&gt;Musonius Rufus.

[[Ambrose|Saint Ambrose of Milan]] was known for applying Stoic philosophy to his theology.

==Modern usage==
The word "stoic" commonly refers to someone indifferent to pain, pleasure, grief, or joy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://buildthefire.com/modern-stoicism/|title=Modern Stoicism {{!}} Build The Fire|date=9 February 2016|website=Build The Fire|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern usage as "person who represses feelings or endures patiently" was first cited in 1579 as a [[noun]], and 1596 as an [[adjective]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=stoic |title=Online Etymology Dictionary&amp;nbsp;– Stoic |accessdate=2006-09-02|last=Harper |first=Douglas |date=November 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the term "[[Epicureanism|Epicurean]]", the ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy's'' entry on Stoicism notes, "the sense of the English adjective 'stoical' is not utterly misleading with regard to its philosophical origins."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/stoicism/ |title=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&amp;nbsp;– Stoicism |accessdate=2006-09-02 |last=Baltzly |first=Dirk |date=13 December 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10124">'''The Bear and the Gardener''' is a [[fable]] of eastern origin that warns against making foolish friendships. There are several variant versions, both literary and oral, across the world and its folk elements are classed as [[Aarne-Thompson classification system|Aarne-Thompson]]-Uther type 1586. The La Fontaine version has been taken as demonstrating various philosophical lessons.

==The Fable==
The story was introduced to western readers in [[La Fontaine's Fables]] (VIII.10).&lt;ref&gt;An English translation is [http://oaks.nvg.org/fonta8.html#sebeargard here]&lt;/ref&gt; Though ''L'Ours et l'amateur des jardins'' is sometimes translated as "The bear and the amateur gardener", the true meaning is 'the garden lover'. It relates how a solitary gardener encounters a lonely bear and they decide to become companions. One of the bear's duties is to keep the flies off his friend when he takes a nap. Unable to drive off a persistent fly, the bear seizes a paving stone to crush it and kills the gardener as well.
[[File:Bear baerenfels.jpg|thumb|left|340px|A garden bear]]
Several lines occurring in the poem are taken as its morals. Midway there is the statement 'In my opinion it's a golden rule/Better be lonely than be with a fool', which the rest of the story bears out. The summing up at the end carries the commentary given by eastern authors that it is better to have a wise enemy than a foolish friend. The fable has given to the [[French language]] the idiom ''le pavé de l'ours'' (the bear's paving stone) and, following the Russian fabulist [[Ivan Krylov]]'s version, to [[Russian language|Russian]] ''medvezhya usluga'' (a bear's service) — both used for any ill-considered action with an unfortunate result. La Fontaine is considered to have been illustrating the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] precept that there should be measure in everything, including the making of friends.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.site-magister.com/prepas/fables2.htm La Fontaines:Fables]&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of [[practical philosophy]], the story also illustrates the important distinction that the bear fails to realise between the immediate good, in this case keeping the flies off a friend, and the ultimate good of safeguarding his welfare.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scienceshumaines.com/le-raisonnement-de-l-ours-et-autres-essais-de-philosophie-pratique_fr_21783.html Sciences Humaines]&lt;/ref&gt;

The story gained currency in England from the 18th century on through translations or imitations of La Fontaine. One of its earliest appearances was in [[Robert Dodsley]]'s ''Select fables of Esop and other fabulists'' (1764), where it is given the title "The Hermit and the Bear" and a milder ending. In this version a hermit has done the bear a good turn; later still this was identified with taking a thorn from its paw, drawing on the story of [[Androcles]] and the Lion. Serving the hermit afterwards out of gratitude, the bear strikes him in the face when driving off a fly, and the two then part.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZUwPAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=dodsley+Aesop%27s+Fables&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kAaFvimu7M&amp;sig=_a_4aLxscJxtJeR6Ydn4zfczHBY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=s-KFTeTROZSAhAfj9-i-BA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Hermit%20and&amp;f=false Fable 23, p.92]&lt;/ref&gt;  It was this version that was taken up in early 19th century rhyming editions for children. Among them are Mary Anne Davis' ''Fables in Verse: by Aesop, La Fontaine, and others'', first published about 1818,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/21189/21189-h/21189-h.htm#gardener See p.282 in this pirated edition]&lt;/ref&gt; and Jefferys Taylor's ''Aesop in Rhyme'' (1820).&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/aesopinrhymewith00tayliala#page/10/mode/2up Pages 11-12]&lt;/ref&gt; Krylov also used the title "The Hermit and the Bear" in his imitation of La Fontaine's fable (1809), but retained the usual fatal ending.&lt;ref&gt;''Kriloff's Fables'', a verse translation by C. Fillingham Coxwell, London 1920, [https://archive.org/stream/kriloffsfables00kryl#page/102/mode/2up pp.103-6]&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the century the origin of the story was forgotten in England and it was taken as one of [[Aesop's Fables]].

==Variants==
[[File:Rumi Bear and Sufi.jpg|thumb|A 1663 Indian miniature of the story from Rumi’s ‘’Mas̱navī’’. (Walters Art Museum)]]
La Fontaine found his fable in a translation of the [[Bidpai]] stories, in which the characters are indeed a bear and a gardener. A variant appeared in [[Rumi]]'s 13th century poem, the [[Masnavi]], which tells the story of a kind man who rescued a bear from a serpent. The animal then devoted itself to its saviour's service and killed him in the manner related.&lt;ref&gt;Book 2, Story 8, [http://www.sacred-texts.com/isl/masnavi/msn02.htm Whinfield's translation]&lt;/ref&gt;

The story ultimately derives from India, where there are two older versions with different characters. The one from the ''[[Panchatantra]]'' involves the pet monkey of a king who strikes at the gnat with a sword and causes his master's death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rain.org/global-garden/folklore-gardening-stories-dec-2001.html Rain.org]&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Masaka [[Jataka]]'' from the Buddhist scriptures it is a carpenter's foolish son who strikes at a fly on his father's head with an axe.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/jatakatales00fran#page/44/mode/2up ''Jataka Tales'', ed. H.T.Francis and E.J.Thomas, Cambridge University Press, 1916, pp.44-5]&lt;/ref&gt; In the former the moral is given as 'Do not choose a fool as a friend', while in the latter it is that 'an enemy with sense is better than a friend without it', which is the sentiment on which La Fontaine closes his fable.

There are yet more variants in the oral tradition. One Pakistani source concerns "The Seven Wise Men of Buneyr", who share at least one exploit with the [[Wise Men of Gotham]]; imported into it is the episode of causing injury by trying to drive off flies, in this case from an old woman whom one of them knocks over with the stone he throws in doing so. In Europe the story is of a fool who breaks a magistrate's nose with a cudgel in taking vengeance on a fly. In Italy this is told of [[Giufà]], in Austria of Foolish Hans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type1586.html A.L.Ashliman]&lt;/ref&gt; A similar episode also occurs at the start of [[Giovanni Francesco Straparola]]'s tale of Fortunio in ''[[The Facetious Nights of Straparola|Facetious Nights]]'' (13.4), written about 1550. That particular collection contains the first instance of several other European folk tales, besides this one.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/nightsofstraparo02stra#page/270/mode/2up Vol.2, London, 1884, p.270ff]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paintings and prints==
Because of the fable's existence in Eastern sources, it has been a particularly popular subject in [[Persian miniature|Muslim miniatures]] from the East. Most often they depict the bear with the stone raised in its paws, as in the manuscript copy of the ''Masnavi'' dating from 1663 in the [[Walters Art Museum]] (see above), and another illustration from Persia dating from a little later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spongobongo.com/Islamic_Art/Persian_Painting/Persian_Bears_Fable_of_the_Friendly_Bear.htm J.H.Terry Gallery]&lt;/ref&gt; A watercolour in Lucknow style, painted by Sital Das round about 1780 and now in the [[British Library]], shows the bear contemplating the gardener after it has killed him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/indiaofficeselect/OIOCEnqFull.asp?ItemID=993&amp;RecNo=6&amp;intPDSearchNo=5734904 India Office]&lt;/ref&gt; Yet another Indian miniature of the fable was among those commissioned from the Punjabi artist Imam Bakhsh Lahori in 1837 by a French enthusiast of fables. Now in the [[:fr:Musée Jean de la Fontaine|Musée Jean de la Fontaine]], it shows the bear in an ornamental garden.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musee-jean-de-la-fontaine.fr/pages/c_mur2detail.php?photo=68-29-1-5.jpg View at the Museum site]&lt;/ref&gt;

Several Western artists have illustrated La Fontaine's fable of "The Bear and the Gardener", including those like [[Jean-Baptiste Oudry]] and [[Gustave Doré]] who were responsible for entire editions of La Fontaine's work. On the other hand, Jean-Charles Cazin's 1892 oil painting of ''L'ours et l'amateur des jardins'' dispenses with the bear altogether. It is a pure landscape showing a southern farm with the ancient gardener slumbering in the foreground. An etching of this was made by Edmond-Jules Pennequin in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.idburyprints.com/index.php?page=artist_print_view.php&amp;pid=6115&amp;keyword=&amp;artist=&amp;medium=&amp;subject=&amp;sign=&amp;price=&amp;page1=1 View at the Idbury Prints site] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005003838/https://www.idburyprints.com/index.php?page=artist_print_view.php&amp;pid=6115&amp;keyword=&amp;artist=&amp;medium=&amp;subject=&amp;sign=&amp;price=&amp;page1=1 |date=2011-10-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other series that include the fable are the innovative water colours that [[Gustave Moreau]] painted in 1886&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture.gouv.fr/Wave/image/joconde/0003/m504101_94ce1535_p.jpg French government site]&lt;/ref&gt; and the coloured etchings by [[Marc Chagall]] (1951) of which ''L'ours et l'amateur des jardins'' is number 83.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.franklinbowlesgallery.com/SF/Artists/Chagall/pages/Etchings/fables/CHAG0945P.htm An illustration is available online] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110225115837/http://www.franklinbowlesgallery.com/SF/Artists/Chagall/pages/Etchings/fables/CHAG0945P.htm |date=2011-02-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally Yves Alix (1890–1969) produced a lithograph of the fable for a de luxe edition of ''20 Fables'' (1966) incorporating the work of as many modernist artists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liveauctioneers.com/item/6349033 Live Auctioneers]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters''''' ({{lang-es|El sueño de la razón produce monstruos}}) is an [[etching]] by the Spanish painter and printmaker [[Francisco Goya]]. Created between 1797 and 1799,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eeweems.com/goya/sleep_of_reason.html |title=Goya - The Sleep of Reason |publisher=Eeweems.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107043903/http://eeweems.com/goya/sleep_of_reason.html |archivedate=2012-01-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; it is the 43rd of 80 etchings making up the suite of satires ''[[Los caprichos|Los Caprichos]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://museum.cornell.edu/collections/view/the-sleep-of-reason-produces-monsters.html ''The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters''] [[Johnson Museum of Art]], [[Cornell University]], 2013. Retrieved 11 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Goya imagines himself asleep amidst his drawing tools, his reason dulled by slumber and bedeviled by creatures that prowl in the dark. The work includes owls that may be symbols of folly and bats symbolizing ignorance. The artist's nightmare reflected his view of Spanish society, which he portrayed in the ''Caprichos'' as demented, corrupt, and ripe for ridicule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = The Metropolitan Museum of Art | authorlink = Metropolitan Museum of Art | title = Francisco de Goya y Lucientes: The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters: Plate 43 of The Caprices (Los Caprichos) | url = http://www.metmuseum.org/TOAH/ho/09/eusi/ho_18.64.43.htm | accessdate = 2008-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The work is held at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York and was the gift of M. Knoedler &amp; Co. in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/338473]&lt;/ref&gt;

The full epigraph for capricho No. 43 reads; "Fantasy abandoned by reason produces impossible monsters: united with her (reason), she (fantasy) is the mother of the arts and the origin of their marvels."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jensen |first1=Robin M. |last2=Vrudny |first2=Kimberly J. |year=2009 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=if4hQec2ClEC&amp;pg=PA39 |title=Visual Theology: Forming and Transforming the Community Through the Arts |publisher=Liturgical Press |page=39 |isbn=978-0-814-65399-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The title of [[C. P. Snow]]'s [[Strangers and Brothers|''The Sleep of Reason'', tenth book in his "Strangers and Brothers" series]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1970/08/23/archives/an-elegiac-ending-to-cp-snows-11novel-cycle-last-things.html?_r=0|title=An elegiac ending to C. P. Snow's 11‐novel cycle|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=2017-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' novel ''[[The Sleep of Reason]]'' are drawn from this print. It also inspired the cover of the [[Andrew Miller (novelist)|Andrew Miller]] novel [[Pure (Miller novel)|''Pure'']], as well as the 2017 album by Swedish metal band Meshuggah, entitled ''[[The Violent Sleep of Reason]].'' Also the names of Finnish occult metal band [[Sleep of Monsters]] and their first album, ''[[Produces Reason]]'' derive from the name of the title.

Occasionally the title phrase is rendered as "The dream of reason produces monsters", since the Spanish word "sueño" can mean either "sleep" or "dream". However, Goya's epigraph makes it clear that his intended interpretation is "the sleep of reason".
