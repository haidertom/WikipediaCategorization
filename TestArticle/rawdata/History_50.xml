==Selection process==
Every two years, it publishes a select list known as the Watch List of Endangered Sites that are in urgent need of [[Historic preservation|preservation]] funding and protection. The sites are nominated by governments, conservation professionals, site caretakers, [[non-government organization]]s (NGOs), concerned individuals, and others working in the field.&lt;ref name=press_release /&gt; An independent panel of international experts then select 100 candidates from these entries to be part of the Watch List, based on the significance of the sites, the urgency of the threat, and the viability of both advocacy and conservation solutions.&lt;ref name=press_release /&gt; For the succeeding two-year period until a new Watch List is published, these 100 sites can avail grants and funds from the WMF, as well as from other foundations, private donors, and corporations by capitalizing on the publicity and attention gained from the inclusion on the Watch List.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WORLD MONUMENTS FUND ANNOUNCES 2006 WORLD MONUMENTS WATCH LIST OF 100 MOST ENDANGERED SITES |author=Holly Evarts |date= October 6, 2009 |publisher=World Monuments Fund |url=http://www.wmf.org/pdf/WMW_2006_release.pdf |accessdate= July 29, 2018 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516051456/http://www.wmf.org/pdf/WMW_2006_release.pdf |archivedate=May 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Northwest Airlines Flight 253}}
On December 25, 2009, 23-year-old [[Nigeria]]n [[Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab]] made an attempt to detonate an explosive substance on [[Northwest Airlines Flight 253]]. The international flight originated in [[Amsterdam Airport Schiphol]] in Amsterdam, Netherlands and made an emergency landing at [[Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport]] in Detroit, Michigan, United States. All 290 people aboard the flight, including Abdulmutallab, survived, though he and several others sustained injuries, most of them minor. After being released from a local hospital, Abdulmutallab was indicted by a federal grand jury on six criminal counts. As a result of the attack, travelers faced increased security and other effects, while the U.S. government saw a backlash to its handling of national security and the incident.

==Criminal charges==

On December 26, a [[criminal complaint]] was filed against Abdulmutallab in the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan]], charging him with two counts: placing a destructive device in, and attempting to destroy, a U.S. civil aircraft.&lt;ref name=complaint&gt;{{vcite news|author=US District Court, Eastern District of Michigan|title=US v.

On January 6, 2010, a federal grand jury indicted Abdulmutallab on six criminal counts including attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction and attempted murder.  "Not guilty" pleas were entered on the behalf of Abdulmutallab at the hearing.&lt;ref&gt;

When asked about his decision to prosecute Abdulmutallab in federal court rather than have him detained under the [[law of war]], U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder defended his position, saying that it was "fully consistent with the long-established and publicly known policies and practices of the Department of Justice, the FBI, and the United States Government as a whole," and that he was confident that Abdulmutallab would be successfully prosecuted under the federal criminal law. Holder had originally been asked by U.S. Senator [[Mitch McConnell]], as well as several others, about his choice on January 26, 2010. The response was sent in a February 3 letter to McConnell and the others.&lt;ref name="Holder McConnell letter"&gt;{{vcite web|url=http://www.nefafoundation.org/miscellaneous/HolderLetterMcConnell_Abdulmutallab2.pdf |title=The Honorable Mitch McConnell |author=Holder, Jr., Eric H. |date=February 3, 2010 |publisher=Office of the Attorney General |accessdate=March 15, 2010 |location=Washington, D.C. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314162954/http://www.nefafoundation.org/miscellaneous/HolderLetterMcConnell_Abdulmutallab2.pdf |archivedate=March 14, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 16, 2012, Abdulmutallab, who had pleaded guilty but remained unrepentant, was sentenced to [[Life imprisonment in the United States|life in prison without the possibility of parole]].&lt;ref name=nyt2-16&gt;{{cite news |title=Would-Be Plane Bomber Is Sentenced to Life in Prison |author= |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/17/us/would-be-plane-bomber-sentenced-to-life.html|newspaper= The New York Times|work= |date=February 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is currently incarcerated at the [[ADX Florence]] supermax prison, near [[Florence, Colorado]].

=== Effect on travel ===
The U.S. government did not raise the [[Homeland Security Advisory System]] terrorist [[United States Department of Homeland Security#Homeland Security Advisory System|threat level]], orange at the time (high risk of terrorist attacks), following the attack.&lt;ref name="ABC"&gt;{{vcite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Travel/explosives-northwest-airlines-plane-amsterdam-detroit/story?id=9423871|title=Man Attempts to Set Off Explosives on Detroit-Bound Airplane|date=December 25, 2009|last1=Esposito|first1=Richard|last2=Mayerowitz|first2=Scott|publisher=[[ABC News]]|accessdate=December 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MSNBC"&gt;{{vcite news |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/34592031/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts |title=Officials: Possible terror attack on Northwest jet |date=December 25, 2009|last1=Windrem |first1=Robert |last2=Johnson |first2=Alex |publisher=MSNBC |accessdate=December 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Department of Homeland Security said that additional security measures would be in place for the remainder of the Christmas travel period.&lt;ref name="FOX"&gt;{{vcite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,581153,00.html|title=Passenger Ignites Explosive on Delta Flight, Al Qaeda Connection Reported|date=December 25, 2009|publisher=Fox News Channel|accessdate=December 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The TSA detailed several of the measures, including a restriction on movement and access to personal items during the last hour of flight for planes entering U.S. airspace. The TSA also said that there would be more officers and security dogs at airports.&lt;ref name="NYT-20091226-2"&gt;{{vcite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/27/us/27plane.html|title=Passengers' Quick Action Halted Attack|date=December 26, 2009 |last1=Shane |first1=Scott |last2=Lipton|first2=Eric |work=The New York Times| accessdate=December 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 28 [[Transport Canada]] announced that for several days it would not allow passengers flying to the U.S. from Canada a carry-on bag, with some exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2009/TRAVEL/12/29/canada.carryons/ "Canada limits carry-on baggage on flights into U.S."], ''CNN'', December 29, 2009.

On January 3, 2010, Clarke said he boarded a jet from Schiphol Airport bound for Heathrow Airport just five days after the Christmas Day terror attack, and that the airport appeared to have imposed no additional security, such as precautionary pat-downs which could easily have discovered the syringe which he claimed he kept in his jacket pocket throughout.&lt;ref&gt;Jarvis, David.

On December 27, a [[Lufthansa]] flight headed for Detroit was diverted to [[Iceland]] when it was discovered to be carrying a bag from a passenger who was not on the plane.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/False-alarm-diverts-Lufthansa-flight-to-Iceland/articleshow/5385005.cms "False alarm diverts Lufthansa flight to Iceland"], ''Times of India'', December 27, 2009.

===U.S. political fallout===
Beginning on the day of the incident, Obama was kept informed via secure conference calls and follow-up briefings.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/26/us/26plane.html?scp=5&amp;sq=obama%20informed%20on%20bomb%20plot&amp;st=cse|title=Terror Attempt Seen as Man Tries to Ignite Device on Jet|author=O'Connor, Anahad|coauthors=Schmitt, Eric|date=December 25, 2009|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[White House Press Secretary]] [[Robert Gibbs]] and Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano said several times on Sunday talk shows that "the system had worked", a statement that engendered some controversy.&lt;ref name="Free Press"&gt;{{vcite news|url=http://www.freep.com/article/20091225/NEWS05/91225022/1318/Reports-NWA-passenger-was-trying-to-blow-up-flight-into-Detroit|title=Reports: NWA passenger was trying to blow up flight into Detroit|date=December 25, 2009|author=Swickard, Joe|coauthors=Patton, Naomi R.|work=[[Detroit Free Press]]| accessdate=December 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=thesystem&gt;{{vcite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2009/12/29/us/politics/AP-US-Obamas-Test-Analysis.html | title=Analysis: Many Question "System Worked" Comment | last=Loven | first=Jennifer | authorlink=Jennifer Loven | date=December 29, 2009 | agency=[[Associated Press]] |work=The New York Times | accessdate=December 30, 2009 }}{{Dead link|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day they retracted the statement, saying that the system had in fact "failed miserably."&lt;ref name="thesystem"/&gt; According to Napolitano, her initial statement had referred to the rapid response to the attack that included alerts sent to the 128 other aircraft in U.S. airspace at the time, and new security requirements for the final hour of every flight, rather than the security failures that allowed the attack to happen.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article6969645.ece |title=I'm the first of many, warns airline 'bomber' Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab |work=The Times |date=December 29, 2009 |accessdate=December 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Napolitano had originally stated on ''[[This Week (ABC TV series)|This Week]]'' that "once this incident occurred, everything went according to clockwork" and that "once the incident occurred, the system worked".&lt;ref name="This Week system worked"&gt;{{vcite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek/week-transcript-napolitano-gibbs-mcconnell/story?id=9428037&amp;page=2|title='This Week' Transcript: Napolitano, Gibbs, McConnell|date=December 27, 2009|work=This Week|publisher=ABC News Internet Ventures|accessdate=March 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The day after the attack, the U.S. [[United States House Committee on Homeland Security|House Homeland Security Committee]] and [[United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation|Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee]] both announced that they would hold hearings in January 2010 to investigate how the device passed through security, and whether further restrictions should be placed on air travel; the Senate hearings began on January 21.&lt;ref name="FOX News"&gt;{{vcite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/12/26/lawmakers-attempted-airline-attack-disturbing-pledge-hold-hearings/|title=Congress to Probe Attempted Airline Attack, Consider Added Security Precautions|date=December 26, 2009|last1=Levine|first1=Mike|last2=Herridge|first2=Catherine|last3=Wolff|first3=Sarah|publisher=Fox News Channel| accessdate=December 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Washington Post"&gt;{{vcite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/12/25/AR2009122501355.html|title=Airports intensify security measures worldwide in wake of failed bomb attack aboard U.S.-bound jetliner|date=December 26, 2009|last1=D.

Four days after the attack, Obama said publicly that Abdulmutallab's ability to board the aircraft was the result of a systemic failure that included an inadequate sharing of information among U.S. and foreign government agencies. He called the situation "totally unacceptable."&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8434275.stm |title=US President Obama notes "system failure" over jet bomb |work=BBC |date=December 29, 2009 |accessdate=December 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He ordered that a report be delivered detailing how some government agencies had failed to share or highlight potentially relevant information about the suspect before he allegedly tried to blow up the airliner.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/12/30/AR2009123003229.html?hpid=topnews |title=Obama to get report on intelligence failures in Abdulmutallab case | author=Karen DeYoung |work=The Washington Post |date=December 31, 2009 | accessdate=January 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later Obama received the briefing, which included statements that information about the suspect had failed to cross agency lines, and that the failures to communicate within the U.S. government had led to the threat posed by Abdulmutallab not being known by certain agencies until the attack. Obama said he would meet with security officials and specifically question why Abdulmutallab was not placed on the U.S. [[no-fly list]], despite the government having received warnings about his potential al-Qaeda links.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8436459.stm |title=Obama briefed on plane bomb security lapses |work=BBC|date=December 31, 2009|accessdate=December 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1419">'''Ali Amiri''' (b. 1857 [[Diyarbakır]] - d. 1923 [[Istanbul]]) was an Ottoman historian. He worked as a finance official and used his assignments to different towns to transcribe Arabic and Turkish inscriptions that he found. He sought out local histories and old documents, both historical and poetic. Through his endeavours he built a library of rare and unpublished manuscripts.

{{Sociology}}
{{marxism}}

In [[Marxism|Marxist theory]], [[capitalist]] [[society]] consists of two parts: the '''base''' (or '''substructure''') and '''superstructure'''. The base comprises the [[Forces of production|forces]] and [[relations of production]] (e.g. employer–employee work conditions, the technical [[division of labour]], and property relations) into which people enter to produce the necessities and amenities of life. The base determines society's other relationships and ideas to comprise its superstructure, including its [[culture]], [[institution]]s, political [[power structure]]s, [[role]]s, [[ritual]]s, and [[State (polity)|state]]. While the relation of the two parts is not strictly unidirectional, as the superstructure often affects the base, the influence of the base is predominant. In [[Orthodox Marxism]], the base determines the superstructure in a one-way relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Chandler |first=Daniel |title=Marxist Media Theory |url=http://www.aber.ac.uk/media/Documents/marxism/marxism07.html |publisher=[[Aberystwyth University]] |accessdate=22 July 2012 |date=10 April 2000 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120705182135/http://www.aber.ac.uk/media/Documents/marxism/marxism07.html |archivedate=5 July 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=November 2018}} Marx and Engels warned against such [[economic determinism]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1890/letters/90_09_21.htm Engels's letter to J. Bloch]; from London to

In some non-[[Western world|Western]] languages, but also, for example, in [[French language|French]], this concept is rendered as "Infrastructure and Superstructure" which could lead to a [[malapropism]]. It has only a vague conceptual relatedness to the [[English language|English]] sense of [[infrastructure]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

==The model and its qualification==
In developing [[Alexis de Tocqueville]]'s observations, Marx identified [[Civil society#Modern history|civil society]] as the economic base and [[political society]] as the political superstructure.&lt;ref&gt;Pawel Zaleski, "Tocqueville on Civilian Society. A Romantic Vision of the Dichotomic Structure of Social Reality", ''Archiv für Begriffsgeschichte'', Felix Meiner Verlag, vol. 50, (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; Marx postulated the essentials of the base–superstructure concept in his preface to ''[[A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy]]'' (1859):

{{quote|In the social production of their existence, men inevitably enter into definite relations, which are independent of their will, namely [the] relations of production appropriate to a given stage in the development of their material forces of production. The totality of these relations of production constitutes the economic structure of society, the real foundation, on which arises a legal and political superstructure, and to which correspond definite ''forms of social consciousness''.&lt;ref&gt;Social Consciousness&lt;/ref&gt; The mode of production of material life conditions the general process of social, political, and intellectual life. It is not the consciousness of men that determines their existence, but their social existence that determines their consciousness. At a certain stage of development, the material productive forces of society come into conflict with the existing relations of production or—this merely expresses the same thing in legal terms—with the property relations within the framework of which they have operated hitherto. From forms of development of the productive forces, these relations turn into their fetters. Then begins an era of social revolution. The changes in the economic foundation lead, sooner or later, to the transformation of the whole, immense, superstructure. In studying such transformations, it is always necessary to distinguish between the material transformation of the economic conditions of production, which can be determined with the precision of natural science, and the legal, political, religious, artistic, or philosophic—in short, ideological forms in which men become conscious of this conflict and fight it out. Just as one does not judge an individual by what he thinks about himself, so one cannot judge such a period of transformation by its consciousness, but, on the contrary, this consciousness must be explained from the contradictions of material life, from the conflict existing between the social forces of production and the relations of production.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Karl (1977). ''[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1859/critique-pol-economy/preface.htm A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy]''. Moscow: Progress Publishers: Notes by R. Rojas.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Marx's "base determines superstructure" axiom, however, requires qualification:
#the ''base'' is the whole of productive relationships, not only a given economic element, e.g. the working class
#historically, the ''superstructure'' varies and develops unevenly in society's different activities; for example, art, politics, economics, etc.
#the ''base–superstructure'' relationship is ''reciprocal''; Engels explains that the base determines the superstructure ''only in the last instance''.&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of the Social Sciences'', "Base and superstructure" entry.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications, revisions, and criticisms ==
Marx's theory of base and superstructure can be found in the disciplines of [[political science]], [[sociology]], [[anthropology]], and [[psychology]] as utilized by Marxist scholars. Across these disciplines the base-superstructure relationship, and the contents of each, may take different forms.

===Max Weber===
Early sociologist [[Max Weber]] preferred a form of [[structuralism]] over a base and superstructure model of society in which he proposes that the base and superstructure are reciprocal in causality—neither economic rationality nor normative ideas rule the domain of society. In summarizing results from his East Elbia research he notes that, contrary to the base and superstructure model "we have become used to," there exists a reciprocal relationship between the two.&lt;ref&gt;Scaff, Lawrence A. The British Journal of Sociology , Vol. 35, No. 2 (Jun., 1984), pp. 190–215
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antonio Gramsci===
The Italian political philosopher [[Antonio Gramsci]] divided [[Marx|Marx's]] superstructure into two elements: political society and civil society. Political society consists of the organized force of society (such as the police and military) while civil society refers to the consensus-creating elements that contribute to [[hegemony]]. Both constituents of this superstructure are still informed by the values of the base, serving to establish and enforce these values in society.&lt;ref&gt;Morera, Esteve
Canadian Journal of Political Science / Revue canadienne de science politique , Vol. 23, No. 1 (Mar., 1990), pp. 28, 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Walter Rodney ===
[[Walter Rodney]], the Guyanese political activist and African historian, discussed the role of [[Karl Marx|Marx's]] superstructure in the context of development cycles and colonialism. Rodney states that while most countries follow a developmental structure that evolves from feudalism to capitalism, China is an exception to this rule and skipped the capitalism step.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Campbell|first=Trevor A.|date=1981|title=The Making of an Organic Intellectual: Walter Rodney (1942-1980)|journal=Latin American Perspectives|volume=8|issue=1|pages=49–63|jstor=2633130}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;"The explanation is very complex, but in general terms the main differences between feudal Europe and feudal China lay in the superstructure – i.e. in the body of beliefs, motivations and sociopolitical institutions which derived from the material base but in turn affected it. In China, religious, educational and bureaucratic qualifications were of utmost importance, and government was in the hands of state officials rather than being run by the landlords on their own feudal estates."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=How Europe underdeveloped Africa|last=Walter|first=Rodney|others=Strickland, William, 1937-, Hill, Robert A., 1943-, Harding, Vincent,, Babu, Abdul Rahman Mohamed|isbn=9781574780482|edition= Revised paperback |location=Baltimore, Maryland|oclc=773301411}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;By extension this means that the Marxist development cycle is malleable due to cultural superstructures, and is not an inevitable path. Rather the role of the superstructure allows for adaptation of the development cycle, especially in a colonial context.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=How Europe underdeveloped Africa|last=Walter|first=Rodney|others=Strickland, William, 1937-, Hill, Robert A., 1943-, Harding, Vincent,, Babu, Abdul Rahman Mohamed|isbn=9781574780482|edition= Revised paperback |location=Baltimore, Maryland|oclc=773301411}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freudo-Marxism and sex-economy===
[[Freudo-Marxism|Freudo-Marxist]] [[Wilhelm Reich|Wilhelm Reich's]] discipline of analysis known as sex-economy is an attempt to understand the divergence of the perceived base and superstructure that occurred during the [[Great Depression|global economic crisis from 1929 to 1933]].&lt;ref&gt;Reich, Wilhelm. The Mass Psychology of Fascism. New York: Albion, 1970. 22–23. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; To make sense of this phenomenon, Reich recategorized social ideology as an element in the base—not the superstructure. In this new categorization, social ideology and social psychology is a material process that self-perpetuates, the same way economic systems in the base perpetuate themselves. Reich focused on the role of [[sexual repression]] in the patriarchal family system as a way to understand how mass support for Fascism could arise in a society.&lt;ref&gt;Reich, Wilhelm. The Mass Psychology of Fascism. New York: Albion, 1970. 14. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticisms in critical theory===
Contemporary Marxist interpretations such as those of [[critical theory]] criticise this conception of the base–superstructure interaction and examine how each affects and conditions the other. [[Raymond Williams]], for example, argues against loose, "popular" usage of base and superstructure as discrete entities which, he explains, is not the intention of Marx and Engels:
{{quote|So, we have to say that when we talk of 'the base', we are talking of a process, and not a state .... We have to revalue 'superstructure' towards a related range of cultural practices, and away from a reflected, reproduced, or specifically-dependent content. And, crucially, we have to revalue 'the base' away from [the] notion[s] of [either] a fixed economic or [a] technological abstraction, and towards the specific activities of men in real, social and economic relationships, containing fundamental contradictions and variations, and, therefore, always in a state of dynamic process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Williams | first = Raymond | author-link = Raymond Williams | title = Base and superstructure in Marxist cultural theory | journal = [[New Left Review]] | volume = I | issue = 82 | date = November–December 1973 | url = https://newleftreview.org/I/82/raymond-williams-base-and-superstructure-in-marxist-cultural-theory | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Can the base be separated from the superstructure?===
[[John Plamenatz]] makes two counterclaims regarding the clear-cut separation of the base and superstructure. The first is that economic structure is independent from production in many cases, with relations of production or property also having a strong effect on production.&lt;ref&gt;Lukes, Steven. The Nature of Political Theory. Ed. David Miller and Larry Siedentop. Oxford [Oxfordshire: Clarendon, 1983. 104. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
The second claim is that relations of production can only be defined with normative terms—this implies that social life and humanity's morality cannot be truly separated as both are defined in a normative sense.&lt;ref&gt;Lukes, Steven. The Nature of Political Theory. Ed. David Miller and Larry Siedentop. Oxford [Oxfordshire: Clarendon, 1983. 105. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The legality question===
A criticism{{weasel inline|date=October 2012}} of the base and superstructure theory is that [[property relations]] (supposedly part of the base and the driving force of history) are actually defined by legal relations, an element of the superstructure. Defenders of the theory claim that Marx believed in property relations and social relations of production as two separate entities.&lt;ref&gt;Cahan, Jean Axelrad. Science &amp; Society , Vol. 58, No. 4 (Winter, 1994/1995), pp. 394–395&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neoliberalism and the state===
Colin Jenkins provides (2014) a critique on the role of the capitalist state in the era of [[neoliberalism]], using base and superstructure theory as well as the work of [[Nicos Poulantzas]]. Regarding developments in the United States during this era (roughly 1980-2015), Jenkins highlights the nature in which political parties and the political system itself are inherently designed to protect the economic base of capitalism and, in doing so, have become "increasingly centralized, coordinated, and synchronized over the past half-century." This, according to Jenkins, has led to a "corporate-fascistic state of being" that is challenging the equilibrium of this fragile relationship. His analysis specifically addresses the role of both major parties, Democrats and Republicans, in the United States:

{{quote|It reminds us of John Dewey's claim that, 'As long as politics is the shadow cast on society by big business, the attenuation of the shadow will not change the substance.' In the US, the two-party political system has proven extremely effective in this regard. Aside from differences on social issues like abortion and gay marriage, as well as socioeconomic issues like unemployment insurance and public assistance, both parties ultimately embrace capitalist/corporatist interests in that they both serve as facilitators for the dominant classes: The Republican Party in its role as forerunner, pushing the limits of the capitalist model to the brink of fascism; and the Democratic Party in its role as governor, providing intermittent degrees of slack and pull against this inevitable move towards a 'corporate-fascistic state of being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Calibrating the Capitalist State in the Neoliberal Era: Equilibrium, Superstructure, and the Pull Towards a Corporate-Fascistic Model |url = http://www.hamptoninstitution.org/calibrating-capitalism-in-the-neoliberal-era.html | publisher = The Hampton Institute | author = Colin Jenkins | date = 2014-02-04 | accessdate = 2014-12-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1889">'''Beef rings''' are cooperative groups of six to twenty-four farms, with each member of the cooperative being required to supply one animal over the course of the summer to the cooperative for [[animal slaughter|slaughter]] they are either done locally on the farm or at a [[slaughterhouse]] at the member's expense. 

==Information==
Beef rings were common among [[North America]]n farmers who had no means for [[refrigeration]] of meat until the beginning of the 20th century. Although pigs were small enough that a smoked [[pork]] carcass could be consumed by a single farming family before the meat spoiled, the same was not true of [[cattle]], and smoked or salted beef was not popular in any case.&lt;ref name=MacLachlan&gt;{{cite book|title=Kill and Chill|author=Ian MacLachlan|pages=124|publisher=University of Toronto Press|date=2002|isbn13=9780802078322}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After obtaining the slaughtered steer, the meat would be distributed among the members of the cooperative, providing them with a [[steak]], a [[roast beef|roast]], and a boiling [[joint]] each week.&lt;ref name=MacLachlan/&gt; By slaughtering each animal in sequence, the cooperative ensured that all members received fresh meat throughout the summer. Distributions were weighed, so that each member received a fair share of the meat.&lt;ref name=Dick&gt;{{cite book|title=Farmers "making Good"|author=Lyle Dick|pages=170|publisher=University of Calgary Press|date=2008|isbn13=9781552382417}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beef rings died out for several reasons, including technological advances in refrigeration, greater economic prosperity for farmers, greater independence, and the ability of farmers to buy meat at butchers' shops rather than slaughter and store it themselves.&lt;ref name=Dick/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1619">'''Boresch III of Ossegg and Riesenburg''' (died before 1312) was a Bohemian aristocrat of the [[House of Riesenburg]].

The son of Boresch II (also ''Bohuslav II'') was a member of the regional court (''Landgericht'') in 1291. At the end of the 13th century ore mining flourished on the Riesenburg estates. On 22 March 1302 he signed a treaty with the [[abbot]] of Ossegg, wherein he agreed to share the mining profits with [[Osek Abbey]].

Following the death of [[Wenceslaus II of Bohemia|King Wenceslaus II]] and the murder of his successor, [[Wenceslaus III of Bohemia|Wenceslaus III]] one year later, a new wave of violence swept through [[Bohemia]], as the powerful princes attempted to extend their estates and wealth during the [[interregnum]]. Church assets were seized, but attempts were also made to rectify the injustices of the past.

Boresch, too, could not resist further extending his power. In 1307 he was named as the owner of [[Sayda]], this time however not as part of the Bohemian Empire but as an [[enfeoffment]] from the [[Margraviate of Meissen]].

He was only mentioned once more before his death. In the treaty documents of 1312 his name no longer appears.

'''''Christopher Columbus and the Participation of the Jews in the Spanish and Portuguese Discoveries''''' is a scholarly work by [[Meyer Kayserling]], translated into English and published in 1894. In it, Keyserling reports on an extensive search of [[List_of_archives_in_Spain|Spanish archives]] including those at [[Alcalá de Henares]], [[Barcelona]], [[Madrid]], and [[Seville]]. His research showed that [[Marranos]], who attempted to shield themselves and their families from the [[anti-Semitic]] violence of the [[Spanish Inquisition]] by outwardly professing Christianity, were an integral part of the [[European_colonization_of_the_Americas|European colonization of the Americas]]. Keyserling's discovery of evidence that [[Luis de Torres]], who sailed with Columbus in 1492, was a Marrano is memorialized in the naming of [[Luis de Torres Synagogue]] in [[the Bahamas]].

== History ==

=== Origins ===
{{See also|Anno Domini}}
The year numbering system used with Common Era notation was devised by the Christian monk [[Dionysius Exiguus]] in the year 525 to replace the [[Era of Martyrs]] system, because he did not wish to continue the memory of a tyrant who persecuted Christians.&lt;ref name=Pedersen /&gt; He attempted to number years from an initial reference date ("[[epoch (reference date)|epoch]]"), an event he referred to as the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]] of Jesus.&lt;ref name=Pedersen /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Doggett, L.E., (1992), [http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEhelp/calendars.html "Calendars"] in Seidelmann, P.K., ''The Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac'', Sausalito CA: University Science Books, 2.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=BW_1mt4oebQC&amp;pg=PA686&amp;dq=jesus+birth+year+before |title=The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia |first=Geoffrey W. |last=Bromiley |publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing |year=1995 |isbn= 978-0-8028-3781-3 |accessdate=2011-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dionysius labeled the column of the table in which he introduced the new era as "''Anni Domini Nostri Jesu Christi''".&lt;ref&gt;Pedersen, O., (1983), "The Ecclesiastical Calendar and the Life of the Church" in Coyne, G.V. et al.

Numbering years in this manner became more widespread in Europe with its usage by [[Bede]] in England in 731. Bede also introduced the practice of dating years before what he supposed was the year of birth of Jesus,&lt;ref&gt;Bede wrote of the Incarnation of Jesus, but treated it as synonymous with birth. Blackburn, B &amp; Holford-Strevens, L, (2003), ''The Oxford Companion to the Year'', Oxford University Press, 778.&lt;/ref&gt; and the practice of not using a year zero.{{efn|As noted in [[History of zero|History of the zero]], the use of zero in Western civilization was uncommon before the twelfth century.}} In 1422, [[Portugal]] became the last [[Western Europe]]an country to [[Spanish era|switch to the system]] begun by Dionysius.&lt;ref name="CathEncy-Chron" /&gt;

=== Vulgar Era ===
[[File:Johannes Kepler 1610.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Johannes Kepler]] first used "Vulgar Era" to distinguish dates on the Christian calendar from the [[regnal year]] typically used in national law.]]
The term "Common Era" is traced back in English to its appearance as "[[wikt:Vulgar|Vulgar]] Era" to distinguish dates on the Ecclesiastic calendar in popular use from dates of the [[regnal year]], the year of reign of a sovereign, typically used in national law.

The first use of the Latin term ''vulgaris aerae''{{Efn|name=VulgarisAerae0|In Latin, ''Common Era'' is written as ''Vulgaris Aerae''. It also occasionally appears as ''æræ vulgaris'', ''aerae vulgaris'', ''aeram vulgarem'', ''anni vulgaris'', ''vulgaris aerae Christianae'', and ''anni vulgatae nostrae aerae Christianas''.}} discovered so far was in a 1615 book by [[Johannes Kepler]].&lt;ref name=VulgarisAerae1 /&gt; Kepler uses it again in a 1616 table of [[Ephemeris|ephemerides]],&lt;ref name=VulgarisAerae2&gt;{{cite book |title=Second use of "vulgaris aerae" (Latin for Common Era) (1616) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0kElSQAACAAJ&amp;dq=vulgaris+aerae|publisher=Plancus |author=Kepler, Johann |year=1616 |accessdate=2011-05-18}} {{cite book |title=Ephemerides novae motuum caelestium, ab Ānno vulgaris aerae MDCXVII en observationibus potissimum Tychonis Brahei hypothesibus physicis, et tabulis Rudolphinis... |first=Johann |last=Kepler |publisher=Plancus |year=1616 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and again in 1617.&lt;ref name=VulgarisAerae3&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5w47twAACAAJ&amp;dq=vulgaris+aerae|title=Third use of "vulgaris aerae" (Latin for Common Era) (1617) |publisher=sumptibus authoris, excudebat Iohannes Plancus |author1=Kepler, Johannes |author2=Fabricus, David |year=1617 |accessdate=2011-05-18}} {{cite book |title=Ephemerides novae motuum coelestium, ab anno vulgaris aerae MDCXVII[-XXXVI]... |quote=Part 3 has title: Tomi L Ephemeridvm Ioannis Kepleri pars tertia, complexa annos à M.DC.XXIX. in M.DC.XXXVI.

=== History of the use of the CE/BCE abbreviation ===
Although Jews have their own [[Hebrew calendar]], they often use the [[Gregorian calendar]], without the AD prefix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |quote=Jews do not generally use the words "A.D." and "B.C." to refer to the years on the Gregorian calendar. "A.D." means "the year of our [[L-rd]]," and we do not believe Jesus is the L-rd. Instead, we use the abbreviations C.E. (Common or Christian Era) and B.C.E. (Before the Common Era). |author=Tracey R Rich |url=http://www.jewfaq.org/calendar.htm#Years | title=Judaism 101 | accessdate=2011-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 1825, the abbreviation VE (for Vulgar Era) was in use among Jews to denote years in the Western calendar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishgen.org/jcr-uk/susser/plymouthinscriptions.htm |title=Plymouth, England Tombstone inscriptions |publisher=Jewish Communities &amp; Records |quote=Here is buried his honour Judah ben his honour Joseph, a prince and honoured amongst philanthropists, who executed good deeds, died in his house in the City of Bath, Tuesday, and was buried here on Sunday, 19 Sivan in the year 5585.

In general publications, in the 200 years between 1808 and 2008 the ratio of usage of BCE to BC has increased by about 20% and CE to AD by about 50%, primarily since 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=BCE,BC,CE,AD&amp;year_start=1808&amp;year_end=2008&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=10&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t1;,BCE;,c0;.t1;,BC;,c0;.t1;,CE;,c0;.t1;,AD;,c0|title=Google Ngram Viewer|website=books.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contemporary usage ==
Some academics in the fields of [[theology]], [[education]] and [[history]] have adopted CE and BCE notation, although there is some disagreement.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the Society for Historical Archaeology states in its more recent style guide "Do not use C.E. (common era), B.P. (before present), or B.C.E.; convert these expressions to A.D. and B.C." (In section I 5 the Society explains how to use "years B.P." in connection with [[radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon ages]].) {{cite web |url=https://sha.org/documents/SHAStyleGuide-Dec2011.pdf |title=Style Guide |author=Society for Historical Archaeology |date=December 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160419052334/http://www.sha.org/documents/SHAStyleGuide-Dec2011.pdf |archivedate=2016-04-19 |accessdate=2017-01-16 |deadurl=no |df=}} whereas the [[American Anthropological Association]] style guide takes a different approach calling for "C.E." and "B.C.E." {{cite web |url=http://www.aaanet.org/publications/guidelines.cfm |title=AAA Style Guide |format=PDF |author=American Anthropological Society
|date=2009 |accessdate=2015-05-26 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More visible uses of Common Era notation have recently surfaced at major museums in the English-speaking world. Furthermore, several style guides now prefer or mandate its usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.egyptstudy.org/ostracon/guidelines.html |journal=The Ostracon – Journal of the Egyptian Studies Society |title=Submission Guidelines for ''The Ostracon'' |quote=For dates, please use the now-standard "BCE–CE" notation, rather than "BC–AD."

Even some style guides for Christian churches prefer its use: for example, the Episcopal Diocese ''Maryland Church News''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ang-md.org/mcn/style_guide.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060620230309/http://ang-md.org/mcn/style_guide.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=20 June 2006 |title=Maryland Church News Submission Guide &amp; Style Manual |work=Maryland Church News |format=PDF |date=1 April 2005 |accessdate=2011-05-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the usage of the BCE/CE notation in [[textbook]]s is growing.&lt;ref name=Gormley /&gt; Some publications have moved over to using it exclusively. For example, the 2007 World Almanac was the first edition to switch over to the BCE/CE usage, ending a 138-year usage of the traditional BC/AD dating notation. It is used by the [[College Board]] in its history tests,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/ap/history_world/topic.html?worldhist |title=AP: World History |accessdate=2011-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the [[Norton Anthology of English Literature]]. Others have taken a different approach. The US-based [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]] uses BCE/CE notation in articles on non-Christian religious topics such as [[Religious significance of Jerusalem#Jerusalem, Jews and Judaism|Jerusalem and Judaism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/topics/jerusalem |title=Jerusalem Timeline |publisher=History Channel |accessdate=2011-05-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520111303/http://www.history.com/topics/jerusalem |archivedate=May 20, 2011 }};{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/topics/jerusalem |title=Jerusalem: Biographies |publisher=History Channel |accessdate=2011-05-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520111303/http://www.history.com/topics/jerusalem |archivedate=2011-05-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, [[England and Wales]] introduced the BCE/CE notation system into the official school curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-531644-ad-and-bc-become-cebce.do |title=AD and BC become CE/BCE |date=9 February 2002 |accessdate=2012-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111220120909/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-531644-ad-and-bc-become-cebce.do |archivedate=December 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2006, in the United States, the Kentucky State School Board reversed its decision to use BCE and CE in the state's new Program of Studies, leaving education of students about these concepts a matter of discretion at the local level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tffky.org/articles/Press%20Releases/prs%2006-14-06%20MC.html |title=State School Board reverses itself on B.C./A.D. controversy |publisher=Family Foundation of Kentucky |accessdate=2011-05-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427032052/http://www.tffky.org/articles/Press%20Releases/prs%2006-14-06%20MC.html |archivedate=April 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://legacy.kctcs.edu/todaysnews/index.cfm?tn_date=2006-06-16#5119 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090710123618/http://legacy.kctcs.edu/todaysnews/index.cfm?tn_date=2006-06-16#5119 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=10 July 2009 |title=School board keeps traditional historic designations |author=Joe Biesk |publisher=Louisville Courier-Journal |date=15 June 2006 |accessdate=2011-05-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cpe.ky.gov/NR/rdonlyres/5F08162C-899F-47FE-9367-1DDD82DE74E6/0/6_CommissionerofEdReport.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060926165947/http://cpe.ky.gov/NR/rdonlyres/5F08162C-899F-47FE-9367-1DDD82DE74E6/0/6_CommissionerofEdReport.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=26 September 2006|title=Kentucky Board of Education Report |publisher=Kentucky Board of Education Report |date=10 June 2006 |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2011, media reports suggested that the BC/AD notation in Australian school textbooks would be replaced by BCE/CE notation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2033225/Australia-goes-PC-ban-BC-Birth-Jesus-removed-reference-point-dates-school-history-books.html |title=Australia goes all PC with a ban on BC: Birth of Jesus to be removed as reference point for dates in school history books |date=2 September 2011|accessdate=2012-02-05 |location=London |work=Daily Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story became national news and drew opposition from some politicians and church leaders. Weeks after the story broke, the [[Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority]] denied the rumour and stated that the BC/AD notation would remain, with CE and BCE as an optional suggested learning activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/adbc-rock-solid-in-curriculum-20111020-1mab2.html |title=AD/BC rock solid in curriculum |date=21 October 2011|accessdate=2012-03-04 |location=Melbourne |work=The Age}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rationale ==

=== Support ===
The use of CE in Jewish scholarship was historically motivated by the desire to avoid the implicit "Our Lord" in the abbreviation ''AD''.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Although other aspects of dating systems are based in Christian origins, AD is a direct reference to Jesus as Lord.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The American and English Encyclopedia of Law and Practice|year=1910|page=1116|quote=It has been said of the Latin words anno Domini, meaning in the year of our Lord [...]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=World Religions At Your Fingertips|author1=Michael McDowell |author2=Nathan Robert Brown |publisher=Penguin|year=2009|isbn=978-1-101-01469-1|page=38|quote=Marked by the turn of the Common Era, C.E., originally referred to as A.D., an abbreviation of the Latin ''Anno Domini'', meaning "Year of our God/Lord." This was a shortening of ''Anno Domini Nostri Jesu Christi'', meaning "Year of our God/Lord Jesus Christ."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of the Common Era notation assert that the use of BCE/CE shows sensitivity to those who use the same year numbering system as the one that originated with and is currently used by [[Christianity|Christians]], but who are not themselves Christian.&lt;ref name="RelTolrnc" /&gt;

Former United Nations Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]], himself a [[Protestant]],&lt;ref name="kofifaith"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Lefevere |first=Patricia |title=Annan: 'Peace is never a perfect achievement'&amp;nbsp;– United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan |publisher=National Catholic Reporter |date=11 December 1998 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1141/is_7_35/ai_53460476 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120713031248/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1141/is_7_35/ai_53460476 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-13 |accessdate=2008-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; has argued:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]he Christian calendar no longer belongs exclusively to Christians. People of all faiths have taken to using it simply as a matter of convenience. There is so much interaction between people of different faiths and cultures – different civilizations, if you like – that some shared way of reckoning time is a necessity. And so the Christian Era has become the Common Era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/News/ossg/sg/stories/articleFull.asp?TID=37 |title=Common values for a common era: Even as we cherish our diversity, we need to discover our shared values |author=Annan, Kofi A., (then Secretary-General of the United Nations) |date=28 June 1999 |publisher=Civilization: The Magazine of the Library of Congress |accessdate=2011-05-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501020027/http://www.un.org/News/ossg/sg/stories/articleFull.asp?TID=37 |archivedate=May 1, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Adena K. Berkowitz, when arguing at the Supreme Court opted to use BCE and CE because "Given the multicultural society that we live in, the traditional Jewish designations – B.C.E. and C.E. – cast a wider net of inclusion" &lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20180814202630/http://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/17/magazine/bc-ad-or-bce-ce.html |author=Safire, William |date=17 August 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Opposition ===
Some oppose the Common Era notation for explicitly religious reasons. Because the BC/AD notation is based on the traditional year of the conception or birth of Jesus, some Christians are offended by the removal of the reference to him in era notation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4188/is_20061202/ai_n16891064|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012132926/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4188/is_20061202/ai_n16891064|dead-url=yes|archive-date=12 October 2007|last=Whitney|first=Susan|title=Altering history?

Two thousand six years since what?

There are also secular concerns. English language expert [[Kenneth G. Wilson (author)|Kenneth G. Wilson]] speculated in his style guide that "if we do end by casting aside the AD/BC convention, almost certainly some will argue that we ought to cast aside as well the conventional numbering system [that is, the method of numbering years] itself, given its Christian basis."&lt;ref name=Wilson /&gt; The short lived [[French Republican Calendar]], for example, began with the first year of the [[French First Republic]] and rejected the seven-day week (with its connections to the [[Book of Genesis]]) for a ten-day week.
Priest and writer on interfaith issues [[Raimon Panikkar]] contends that using the designation BCE/CE is a "return... to the most bigoted Christian colonialism" towards non-Christians, who do not necessarily consider the time period following the beginning of the calendar to be a "common era".&lt;ref name=Panikkar&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9-vYAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Panikkar,+Raimon+(2004).+Christophany:+The+Fullness+of+Man.

In certain North American academic circles one can see a return-with repercussions elsewhere-to the most bigoted Christian colonialism, along with the good intention of overcoming it. It has been suggested that the terminology of the Western calendar, Christian in origin, be replaced by one that presumably would be neutral and universal. It is understandable that some would protest the use of A.D. (anno Domini), but by eliminating B.C. (before Christ) and substituting B.C.E. (Before the Common Era) scholars betray the depths of the cultural impact of the historico-Christian event. After all, Jesus was not born in the year 1. We select a single event but without any value judgment. To call our age "the Common Era," even though for the Jews, the Chinese, the Tamil, the Muslims, and many others it is not a common era, constitutes the acme of colonialism.|accessdate=2011-05-18|isbn=978-1-57075-564-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' report, it was a student's use of BCE/CE notation, inspired by its use within [[Wikipedia]], which prompted the teacher and politician [[Andrew Schlafly]] to found [[Conservapedia]], a [[Cultural conservatism|cultural conservative]] [[wiki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Simon |first=Stephanie |title=A conservative's answer to Wikipedia|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jun/19/nation/na-schlafly19 |date=22 June 2007 |work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=2011-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of its "Conservapedia Commandments" is that users must always apply BC/AD notation, since its sponsors perceive BCE/CE notation to "deny the historical basis" of the dating system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conservapedia.com/Conservapedia:Commandments Conservapedia Commandments] at Conservapedia&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conventions in style guides ==
The abbreviation BCE, just as with BC, always follows the year number. Unlike AD, which traditionally precedes the year number, CE always follows the year number (if context requires that it be written at all).&lt;ref name=Wilson /&gt; Thus, the current year is written as {{currentyear}} in both notations (or, if further clarity is needed, as {{currentyear}} CE, or as AD {{currentyear}}), and the year that [[Socrates]] died is represented as 399 BCE (the same year that is represented by 399 BC in the BC/AD notation). The abbreviations are sometimes written with small capital letters, or with [[Full stop|periods]] (e.g., "&lt;span style="font-size:87%;"&gt;B.C.E.&lt;/span&gt;" or "C.E.").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/about15_rules.html |title=Major Rule Changes in The Chicago Manual of Style, Fifteenth Edition |year=2003 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |quote=Certain abbreviations traditionally set in small caps are now in full caps (AD, BCE, and the like), with small caps an option. |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070909071543/http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/about15_rules.html|archivedate=9 September 2007|accessdate=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Style guides for academic texts on religion generally prefer BCE/CE to BC/AD.&lt;ref&gt;''SBL Handbook of Style'' [[Society of Biblical Literature]] 1999 "8.1.2 ERAS – The preferred style is B.C.E. and C.E.

* In [[Germany]], Jews in [[Berlin]] seem to have already been using "(Before the) Common Era" in the 18th century, while others like [[Moses Mendelssohn]] opposed this usage as it would hinder the integration of Jews into German society.&lt;ref name="Jewish Joke" /&gt; The formulation seems to have persisted among German Jews in the 19th century in forms like ''vor der gewöhnlichen Zeitrechnung'' (before the common chronology).&lt;ref&gt;''Allgemeine Zeitung des Judenthums.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31950">'''Conjectural history''' is a type of [[historiography]] isolated in the 1790s by [[Dugald Stewart]], who termed it "theoretical or conjectural history", as prevalent in the historians and early social scientists of the [[Scottish Enlightenment]]. As Stewart saw it, such history makes space for speculation about causes of events, by postulating natural causes that could have had such an effect. His concept was to be identified closely with the French terminology ''histoire raisonnée'', and the usage of "natural history" by [[David Hume]] in his work ''[[The Natural History of Religion]]''. It was related to "philosophical history", a broader-based kind of historical theorising, but concentrated on the early history of man in a type of [[rational reconstruction]] that had little contact with evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Adam Smith|title=The Glasgow Edition of the Works and Correspondence of Adam Smith: III: Essays on Philosophical Subjects : With Dugald Stewart's 'Account of Adam Smith': With Dugald Stewart's 'Account of Adam Smith'|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=48IO3cLjaWcC&amp;pg=PA293|accessdate=4 March 2013|date=1 May 1980|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-159117-4|page=293}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gordon MacIntyre|title=Dugald Stewart: The Pride and Ornament of Scotland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jOFVh-i3Z04C&amp;pg=PA253|accessdate=1 March 2013|date=1 September 2003|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|isbn=978-1-903900-34-5|page=253}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Frank Palmeri|title=Satire, History, Novel: Narrative Forms, 1665–1815|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HZrp6ZZQmiYC&amp;pg=PA232|accessdate=2 March 2013|year=2003|publisher=University of Delaware Press|isbn=978-0-87413-829-0|pages=231–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such conjectural history was the antithesis of the [[narrative history]] being written at the time by [[Edward Gibbon]] and [[William Robertson (historian)|William Robertson]]. Stewart defended it as more universal in its application to [[humankind]], even at the cost of detailed documentation.&lt;ref&gt;Nisbet and Costa, p. 629.&lt;/ref&gt; It was not concerned with the political narrative and public life, but saw itself as an investigative "moral science".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark Salber Phillips|title=Society and Sentiment: Genres of Historical Writing in Britain, 1740–1820|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2zZjGBmpk88C&amp;pg=PA171|accessdate=3 March 2013|date=1 May 2000|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-2362-8|page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; General philosophical history was somewhat closer to narrative history than conjectural history could be, with its reliance in part on tenuous arguments on the nature of [[feudalism]] and early ethnographical reports from European travellers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rosemary Sweet|title=Writing of Urban Histories in 18th Century England|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n32ZwLcgaFUC&amp;pg=PA143|accessdate=2 March 2013|year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-820669-9|pages=143–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Stewart the ''Dissertation on the Origin of Languages'' by [[Adam Smith]] was an important example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=scottish-18th |title=Scottish Philosophy in the 18th Century |last=Broadie |first=Alexander|Thu Aug 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; To justify the procedures of conjectural history, there needed to be an assumption of the uniformity of [[human nature]], or as Stewart put it, the "capacities of the human mind".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Alexander Broadie |title=The Scottish Enlightenment: An Anthology|year=1997 |publisher=Canongate Books |isbn=978-0-86241-738-3|pages=25–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early Modern context==
There was nothing new in the idea of stages of society on its own, but social thinking itself was changing in [[Early Modern Europe]], particularly on [[civil society]] in its components, [[civility]] and "society".

===Models and the "savage"===
{{main article|Noble savage}}
Hodgen comments, in a chapter ''From Hierarchy to History'', on the widespread use of "conjectural series" for historical explanation in the Early Modern period. The [[great chain of being]] was a static idea. "Stage series" had roots in classical thought, but might be associated with cyclic models, or incorporate ideas of decline with those of progress. She writes that in time

&lt;blockquote&gt;...&amp;nbsp;it seems certain that hierarchical ideas, temporalized to suit the needs of the conjectural historian of culture, were mixed with historical assumptions concerning the savage as a conjectural first member of these conjectural series.&lt;ref&gt;Hodgen, p. 467.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Early Modern natural history===
While the ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' of [[Pliny the Elder]] was a classical Roman encyclopedic work, "natural history" had several different meanings in the Early Modern period. The one relevant in this article is the [[Baconian natural history]], i.e. a systematic collection of observable information on natural phenomena. A natural history did not belong to [[natural philosophy]], which was theoretical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=G. N. Cantor|author3=J. R. R. Christie|author2=M. J. S. Hodge, R. C. Olby|title=Companion to the History of Modern Science|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gkJn6ciwYZsC&amp;pg=PT260|accessdate=4 March 2013|date=6 August 2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-97751-2|page=260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Histoire raisonnée''===
The ''histoire raisonnée'' was a genre of historical writing developed in France in the 17th century, with concerns for the individual in social context, and the description of culture and customs as integral to history. It grew out of [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] historiography with its close relationship to classical Roman and Greek models, but brought to the surface social matters, in particular as they could explain the motivations of individuals. With [[Géraud de Cordemoy]] there came an interest in causality as playing a part in historical movement, as distinct from the humanist acceptance of personal fates being subject to [[Fortuna|Fortune]].&lt;ref&gt;Leffler, pp. 223–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stadial history===
Contemporary terminology is '''stadial history''', or in other words the discussion of stages of society by theoretical means (see [[sociocultural evolution#Stadial theory]]). Stadial theory as an innovation is attributed to the jurist [[Samuel Pufendorf]].&lt;ref name="FitzpatrickJones2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Martin Fitzpatrick|author2=Peter Jones|author3=Christa Knellwolf|author4=Iain McCalman|title=Enlightenment World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DSFy4wZ6Bz0C&amp;pg=PT258|accessdate=2 March 2013|date=22 July 2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-60784-6|pages=258–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Grotius]] had already used conjectural history to discuss [[Aquinas]] on [[private property]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Istvan Hont|title=Jealousy Of Trade: International Competition and the Nation State in Historical Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lHu6kBLV4CUC&amp;pg=PA422|accessdate=4 March 2013|year=2005|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-01038-3|pages=422–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some basic conjectural history on [[human civilization]] was therefore discussed in the 17th century. Later [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] rejected the concept of the [[state of nature]], and with [[Count Buffon]] debated the rise of civilization. The Scottish contribution then took the theory to a new level, with its [[anthropocentrism]] and detailed explanations of human manipulation of nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nathaniel Wolloch|title=History and Nature in the Enlightenment: Praise of the Mastery of Nature in Eighteenth-Century Historical Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aWYe2DZbYskC&amp;pg=PA92|accessdate=2 March 2013|date=1 May 2011|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-1-4094-2115-3|pages=92–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It laid emphasis on a typical society at its beginnings, regarding evidence from contemporary reports (particularly of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]]) as valid.&lt;ref&gt;Hopfl, pp. 24–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conjectural histories of language and writing==
Adam Smith in lectures on rhetoric, given from 1748,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ian Simpson Ross|title=The Life of Adam Smith|page=80|date=23 September 2010|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-161394-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; advanced a speculative history of language; he wrote that he had been prompted by a 1747 work of [[Gabriel Girard (priest)|Gabriel Girard]]. He was then interested in our awareness of literary style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Adam Smith: The Rhetoric of Propriety|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d_MODA0NVjQC&amp;pg=PA83|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-8262-9|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the example that Dugald Stewart took up in coining the phrase "conjectural history". Elements would have been recognised at the time as drawing on the Bible, and in classical literature [[Lucretius]]; it is now considered Smith was influenced by [[Montesquieu]] on law and government. The theory on language and its typology over time has been seen as typical of Smith's historical approach; and even the foundation of his later well-known work on [[political economy]]. Caveats have also been entered, by David Raphael: it cannot be stretched to Smith's [[history of astronomy]]; and the term can be seen as a misnomer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ian Simpson Ross|title=The Life of Adam Smith|pages=85–7|date=23 September 2010|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-161394-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gordon Bigelow|title=Fiction, Famine, and the Rise of Economics in Victorian Britain and Ireland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BLIwbbcbuKcC&amp;pg=PA50|date=20 November 2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-44085-1|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monboddo, on the other hand, wrote at length a conjectural history of language because he emphasised the history of [[manners]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark Salber Phillips|title=Society and Sentiment: Genres of Historical Writing in Britain, 1740–1820|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2zZjGBmpk88C&amp;pg=PA151|date=1 May 2000|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=1-4008-2362-5|page=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Warburton]] had proposed a stadial conjectural history of writing in his ''[[Divine Legation of Moses]]'', a work supporting [[biblical authority]], around 1740. It was taken up in France after the translation in ''[[Essai sur les hiéroglyphes des Égyptiens]]''. Where writing moved from [[pictogram]]s to [[alphabet]]s, he saw language use as having moved analogously from [[gesture]]s to forms and figures of speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jorge Cañizares-Esguerra|title=How to Write the History of the New World: Histories, Epistemologies, and Identities in the Eighteenth-century Atlantic World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JzIGYxOC1oUC&amp;pg=PA109|year=2001|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-4693-9|pages=109–111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The four stages theory==
The term "conjectural history" was not generally accepted in Stewart's time.&lt;ref name="O'Brien"&gt;{{cite book|author=Karen O'Brien|title=Narratives of Enlightenment: Cosmopolitan History from Voltaire to Gibbon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q9bOow5IFUwC&amp;pg=PA133|accessdate=1 March 2013|date=5 June 1997|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-46533-5|pages=132–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was an orthodox '''four stages theory''' of society, the stages being:

# [[hunter-gatherer|hunting]];
# [[pasturage]];
# [[agriculture]]; and 
# [[commerce]].

This ladder-like ordering was taken to be a strict, linear progression, or [[unilineal evolution]]. Some [[economic determinism]] applied, in the sense that the baseline of subsistence was assumed to have a serious effect on social matters. The stages were supposed to represent progress on a moral level, as well as that of economic complexity. French as well as Scottish Enlightenment writers subscribed to such a pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Rosen|title=On Voluntary Servitude: False Consciousness and the Theory of Ideology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FBBEWlGOhSMC&amp;pg=PA117|accessdate=1 March 2013|year=1996|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-63779-5|page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The invention of this type of theory (three or four stages) is attributed to a number of European writers from the 1750s onwards, such as Adam Smith, [[Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune|Turgot]] and [[Giambattista Vico|Vico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ter Ellingson|title=The Myth of the Noble Savage|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nqE3IhkeWToC&amp;pg=PA159|accessdate=1 March 2013|date=17 December 2000|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-92592-2|page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Scottish context it appears in works from 1758 by [[David Dalrymple, Lord Hailes|David Dalrymple]] and [[Lord Kames]]; it has been argued that their source was the Edinburgh lectures of Smith on [[jurisprudence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Knud Haakonssen|title=The Cambridge Companion to Adam Smith|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G6bhhU3iyhIC&amp;pg=PA225|accessdate=2 March 2013|date=6 March 2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-77924-1|page=225 note 18.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In France it was published at much the same time, also, by [[Claude Pierre Goujet]], [[Claude Adrien Helvétius]], and [[François Quesnay]].&lt;ref name="FitzpatrickJones2004"/&gt; Smith's "[[natural progress of opulence]]" is a closely related theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James Noggle|title=The Temporality of Taste in Eighteenth-Century British Writing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mUT8187WaxkC&amp;pg=PA165|accessdate=1 March 2013|date=9 February 2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-964243-4|page=165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Representative works==
Besides Adam Smith, prominent Scottish authors in the field of conjectural history included [[Adam Ferguson]], David Hume, Lord Kames, [[John Millar (philosopher)|John Millar]], and [[Lord Monboddo]], writing from the later 1750s to later 1770s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=William Zachs |title=Without Regard to Good Manners: A biography of Gilbert Stuart (1743–1786) |year=1992 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |isbn=978-0-7486-0319-0 |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith, Kames and Millar were content to adhere to the four stage theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Porscha Fermanis|title=John Keats and the Ideas of the Enlightenment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JhfJN8IzDOgC&amp;pg=PA67|accessdate=1 March 2013|year=2009|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=978-0-7486-3780-5|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monboddo's stadial history was more complex, and very much more controversial. He included [[primate]]s and [[feral children]] as material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alexander Broadie|title=The Cambridge Companion to the Scottish Enlightenment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gtda5SVxaF4C&amp;pg=PA82|accessdate=1 March 2013|date=10 April 2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-00323-0|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robertson in his ''History of America'' moves between narrative and conjectural history.&lt;ref&gt;Hopfl, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adam Ferguson, ''An Essay on the History of Civil Society'' (1767)===
{{details|An Essay on the History of Civil Society}}
Ferguson in this work attempted a rigorous identification of the hunter stage with the so-called [[barbarian]] or savage, and was very alive to the whole scheme as full of tensions within human possibility.&lt;ref&gt;Pocock, pp. 330–5.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued against the [[foundation story]] in the style of classical history, proposing instead that [[unintended consequences]] could have more to do with the "establishment" of a society than a self-conscious law-giver.&lt;ref&gt;Hopfl, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Millar, ''Observations concerning the Distinction of Ranks in Society'' (1771)===
Millar argued in terms of a "system of manners" associated with each of the four stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James Chandler|title=England in 1819: The Politics of Literary Culture and the Case of Romantic Historicism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RqWLrZ3UEvcC&amp;pg=PA128|accessdate=2 March 2013|date=26 June 1999|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-10109-5|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also discussed the advance of freedom, and denounced slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lynn Avery Hunt|title=Measuring Time, Making History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A6nrL1XxpGYC&amp;pg=PA60|accessdate=2 March 2013|date=28 February 2008|publisher=Central European University Press|isbn=978-963-9776-14-2|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; As property became more complex, it followed that government did so also.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Porter |first=Roy |authorlink=Roy Porter |title=Enlightenment|year=2001 |publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=978-0-14-025028-2 |page=253}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poovey states that this work makes apparent the relationship of conjectural history with the [[experimental moral philosophy]] of [[Thomas Reid]] and [[George Turnbull (theologian)|George Turnbull]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mary Poovey|title=A History of the Modern Fact: Problems of Knowledge in the Sciences of Wealth and Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cf7ProAtFBkC&amp;pg=PA223|accessdate=2 March 2013|date=1 December 1998|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-67525-1|page=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lord Kames, ''Sketches of the History of Man'' (1774)===
Kames has been called the leader of Scottish conjectural history, and had objections he expressed in correspondence to both Rousseau and the approach of [[Montesquieu]], as reducing the role of human nature, which he thought was not a constant but the goal of the investigation.&lt;ref name="Carhart2007"/&gt; The connection was that conjectural history was to be used as a framework of a discussion of [[natural law]].&lt;ref name="O'Brien"/&gt; In writing to [[Basel]] in search of a suitable opponent to Rousseau, Kames prompted a work from [[Isaak Iselin]], ''Ueber die Geschichte der Menschheit'' (1764), which is also a conjectural history.&lt;ref name="Carhart2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Knud Haakonssen|title=The Cambridge History of Eighteenth-Century Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s6ExSHrknywC&amp;pg=PA1140|accessdate=2 March 2013|year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-86743-6|page=1140 note 62.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Sketches'' was a collection of essays on social, cultural and political topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Elizabeth Sauer|title=Reading the Nation in English Literature: A Critical Reader|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=blEcG669IWIC&amp;pg=PA92|accessdate=2 March 2013|year=2010|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-44524-5|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it the author collected some ethnographic and miscellaneous information, assembling in particular a long chapter intended as a "history of women".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Dr Alan Barnard|author2=Jonathan Spencer|title=Encyclopedia of Social and Cultural Anthropology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o1VpdrbH3BUC&amp;pg=PA280|accessdate=2 March 2013|date=1 September 2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-203-45803-7|page=280}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Frank Trentmann|title=Paradoxes of Civil Society: New Perspectives on Modern German and British History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ry0AybYtwEC&amp;pg=PA69|accessdate=2 March 2013|date=1 October 2003|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=978-1-57181-143-1|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a second edition (Edinburgh, 1778) and a third (Dublin, 1779). Kames was an early [[polygenist]], or was an [[environmental monogenist]] only with scepticism about the adequacy of the theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John P. Jackson, Jr.|author2=Nadine M.

==Later developments==

===The tradition comes to an end===
Mainstream conjectural and philosophical history, in the Scottish style, hardly survived as a living tradition into the 1790s. Works went out of print; younger authors such as [[John Adams (writer)|John Adams]], [[William Alexander (physician)|William Alexander]] and [[John Logan (minister)|John Logan]] failed to renew the ideas, with Alexander's ''History of Women'' (1779) being criticised as shallow.&lt;ref name="Broich"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ulrich Broich|title=Reactions to Revolutions: The 1790s and Their Aftermath|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vLvLPSwF-bIC&amp;pg=PA232|accessdate=3 March 2013|year=2007|publisher=LIT Verlag Münster|isbn=978-3-8258-7427-8|pages=232–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark Salber Phillips|title=Society and Sentiment: Genres of Historical Writing in Britain, 1740–1820|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2zZjGBmpk88C&amp;pg=PA163|accessdate=4 March 2013|date=1 May 2000|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-2362-8|page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dugald Stewart's formulation of conjectural history was published in 1794, in his ''Account'' of Adam Smith for the ''Transactions'' of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Adam Smith|title=The Glasgow Edition of the Works and Correspondence of Adam Smith: III: Essays on Philosophical Subjects: With Dugald Stewart's 'Account of Adam Smith':|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=48IO3cLjaWcC&amp;pg=PA268|accessdate=4 March 2013|date=1 May 1980|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-159117-4|page=268}}&lt;/ref&gt; The question has been raised as to Stewart's intention then in describing the tradition in that way, and [[John Burrow]] has argued that he wished to dissociate Smith from political radicalism.&lt;ref name="Burrow1966"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Wyon Burrow|title=Evolution and Society: A Study in Victorian Social Theory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OUM4AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA54|accessdate=4 March 2013|year=1966|publisher=CUP Archive|isbn=978-0-521-04393-9|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where stadial theory appeared in later authors, the original thrust was distorted.&lt;ref name="Broich"/&gt; Hopfl has said that the heirs were [[James Mill]], [[John Stuart Mill]], and [[Auguste Comte]].&lt;ref&gt;Hopfl, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Hawthorne writes instead of the historical/sociological insights of the Scots being lost in the British context, despite the "tension between a 'natural' account of civil society and a developing sense of the factual importance and moral difficulties of individualism" having become apparent, to [[utilitarianism]] and vaguer [[evolutionism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Geoffrey Hawthorn |title=Enlightenment and Despair: A History of Social Theory |year=1987 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-33721-6 |page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious opposition===
The ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', in its [[Encyclopædia Britannica Second Edition|second edition]] but particularly in its [[Encyclopædia Britannica Third Edition|third edition]] (1797), attacked the premises of conjectural history from a biblical angle. In the second edition [[James Tytler]] opposed the polygenist approach of Kames. The third edition, under the editorship of [[George Gleig]], featured "Savage" as a new topic, and expanded articles "Society" and "Moral philosophy". Cross-referenced to theological and biblical topics, and to articles by [[David Doig]] who had answered Kames with ''Two Letters on the Savage State'' from 1775/6, these articles in particular argued the orthodox Christian case. [[Robert Heron (writer)|Robert Heron]] contributed to the article "Society", and took aim at the four stages theory, claiming polygenism followed from it (in contradiction to the Bible). Further, the assumption of a baseline state of savagery also seemed to Heron to be implicated with polygenism; and he with Doig attacked the assumption as echoing [[Lucretius]] and [[Democritus]], and godless materialist [[spontaneous generation]] of humankind, implicit in the whole idea of conjectural history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Aa.vv.|title=Storia della Storiografia.

===Relationship to antiquarianism===
Conjectural argument had a bad name in 18th century British [[antiquarian]] circles. An austere and sceptical approach centred on facts, as adopted by [[Richard Gough (antiquarian)|Richard Gough]] and [[James Douglas (antiquary)|James Douglas]], was favoured in the second half of the century.&lt;ref name="Sweet"&gt;Sweet, pp. 20–3.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the interpretations of the stadial theory were quite welcome, and while popularised by the Scottish school, did not seem innovative in the sense of a break with Early Modern historiography, and concerns with natural law and [[civic humanism]]. The urban history of [[John Trussel]] was a precursor. The discussion of the breakdown of the [[feudal system]] was a topic of considerable antiquarian interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rosemary Sweet|title=Writing of Urban Histories in 18th Century England|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n32ZwLcgaFUC&amp;pg=PA143|accessdate=3 March 2013|year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-820669-9|pages=143–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stadial history was embraced by [[Thomas Pownall]].&lt;ref name="Sweet"/&gt;

===Conjectural history of peoples===
[[Charles Athanase Walckenaer]] in 1798 took up the four stage theory, augmented to five stages, by dividing "hunting" into "gathering" followed by a pure hunting stage. This was an effort to classify peoples of the world by development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin S. Staum|title=Labeling People: French Scholars on Society, Race, and Empire, 1815–1848|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CJfz4ptLD0kC&amp;pg=PA13|accessdate=4 March 2013|date=20 August 2003|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP|isbn=978-0-7735-7124-2|pages=13–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early anthropology carried into the 19th century assumptions about the search for origins of civilisation, and unilineal evolution, as appropriate tools for investigating societies. It was widely assumed, further, that current "peoples" were a window into the past. These approaches were seen in [[Lewis Henry Morgan]]. Eventually, in the 20th century, field work and [[structural functionalism]] led to a rejection of the whole paradigm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Giorgio Ausenda|title=After Empire: Towards an Ethnology of Europe's Barbarians|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wqvhYaHrryEC&amp;pg=PA96|accessdate=5 March 2013|date=1 February 2003|publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer|isbn=978-0-85115-853-2|pages=96–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Consensus Tigurinus.jpg|thumb|Title page of 1551 Geneva edition]]
The '''''Consensus Tigurinus''''' or '''Consensus of Zurich''' was a document intended to bring unity to the [[Protestant]] churches on their doctrines of the [[sacraments]], particularly the [[Eucharist|Lord's Supper]]. [[John Calvin]], who stood in between the [[Lutheran]] view of [[Real Presence]] and the [[Zwingli]]an view of pure symbolism,  wrote the first draft of the document in November 1548, with notes by [[Heinrich Bullinger]]. It taught:

:that the Sacraments are not in and of themselves effective and conferring [[divine grace|grace]], but that God, through the [[Holy Spirit]], acts through them as means; that the internal effect appears only in the [[predestination|elect]]; that the good of the Sacraments consists in leading us to [[Christ]], and being instruments of the grace of God, which is sincerely offered to all; that in [[baptism]] we receive the remission of sins, although this proceeds primarily not from baptism, but from the blood of Christ; that in the Lord's Supper we eat and drink the body and blood of Christ, not, however, by means of a carnal presence of Christ's human nature, which is in heaven, but by the power of the Holy Spirit and the devout elevation of our soul to  heaven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/creeds1.ix.ii.ix.html |title=Creeds of Christendom, with a History and Critical notes |volume=I |author=[[Philip Schaff]] |chapter=The Consensus of Zurich. A.D. 1549 |pages=472}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calvin sent the document to the Swiss churches, but the Synod at [[Berne]] opposed Calvin's view strongly and continued to do so until after Calvin's death. In May 1549, Calvin met with [[William Farel]] and Bullinger in [[Zurich]], and the three revised the document into its final form, which was published in Zurich and [[Geneva]] in 1551. It attempted to coalesce the Calvinist and the advanced Zwinglian doctrines while standing opposed to [[transubstantiation]], the [[Roman Catholic]] view, and [[sacramental union]], the Lutheran view. It was accepted by the churches in Zurich, Geneva,  [[Saint Gall]], [[Schaffhausen]], the [[Grisons]], [[Neuchâtel]], and eventually by [[Basel]], and brought them into harmony with one another. It was "favorably received" in France, England, and parts of Germany, but while [[Melancthon]] said that he understood the Swiss for the first time and would no longer write against them, it was attacked by the [[Gnesio-Lutheran]] [[Joachim Westphal (of Hamburg)|Joachim Westphal]] and "became the innocent occasion of the second sacramental war."&lt;ref&gt;Schaff, pp. 472–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cundill Prize in History at McGill is administered by McGill University's Dean of Arts, with the help of the [https://mcgill.ca/misc McGill Institute for the Study of Canada] (MISC).&lt;ref name=mgaz2010/&gt;

When the Prize was announced in April 2008, Mr. Cundill noted that he "… was surprised to learn there were no major prizes in history." He explained his affinity to history: "I am an investment researcher of finance and I think there is an analogy between the two disciplines – both study the past to understand the present and predict the future."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mcgill.ca/newsroom/news/item/?item_id=100163]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dhul-Qarnayn''', ({{lang-ar|ذو القرنين}} ''{{transl|ar|ḏū'l-qarnayn}}'', {{IPA-ar|ðuːlqarˈnajn|IPA}}), "he of the two horns" (or figuratively “he of the two ages”), appears in [[Surah 18]] verses 83-101]] of the [[Quran]] as a figure empowered by [[God in Islam|Allah]] to erect a wall between mankind and [[Gog and Magog]], the representation of chaos.{{sfn|Netton|2006|p=72-73}} The [[End time|end of the world]] would be signaled by the release of Gog and Magog from behind the wall, and their destruction by God in a single night would usher in the [[Islamic eschatology|Day of Resurrection]] (''Yawm al-Qiyāmah)''.{{sfn|Cook|2005|p=8,10}}

==Surat al-Kahf (surah 18), verses 83-101 ==
[[File:Derbent wall.jpg|thumb|200px|The Caspian Gates in [[Derbent]], Russia, part of the defence systems built by the [[Sassanid Persia]]ns, often identified with the Gates of Alexander]]

The story of Dhul-Qarnayn is related in chapter 18 ([[Surat al-Kahf]], "The Cave") of the Quran. This chapter was revealed to Muhammad when his tribe, Quraysh, sent two men to discover whether the Jews, with their superior knowledge of the scriptures, could advise them on whether Muhammad was a true prophet of God. The rabbis told them to ask Muhammad about three things, one of them "about a man who travelled and reached the east and the west of the earth, what was his story". "If he tells you about these things, then he is a prophet, so follow him, but if he does not tell you, then he is a man who is making things up, so deal with him as you see fit." (Verses [[wikisource:The Holy Qur'an! scope="row"|18:83-98]]).

The verses of the chapter reproduced below show Dhul-Qarnayn traveling first to the Western edge of the world where he sees the sun set in a muddy spring, then to the furthest East where he sees it rise from the ocean, and finally northward to a place in the mountains where he finds a people oppressed by Gog and Magog:

==The Alexander Romance and Dhul-Qarnayn==
[[File:Alexander-Coin.jpg|thumb|Silver [[tetradrachm]] of Alexander the Great shown wearing the horns of the ram-god [[Amun|Zeus-Ammon]].]]

The story of Dhul-Qarnayn has its origins in legends of [[Alexander the Great]] current in the Middle East in the early years of the Christian era. According to these legends the [[Scythians]], the descendants of [[Gog and Magog]], once defeated one of Alexander's generals, upon which Alexander built a wall in the [[Caucasus mountains]] to keep them out of civilised lands (the basic elements of the legend are found in [[Flavius Josephus]]). The [[Alexander Romance]] went through much further elaboration in subsequent centuries before eventually finding its way into the Quran through a Syrian version.{{sfn|Bietenholz|1994|p=122-123}}

Alexander was already known as "the two-horned one" in these early legends.{{sfn|Van Donzel|Schmidt|2010|p=57}} The reasons for this are somewhat obscure: the scholar [[al-Tabari]] (839-923 CE) held it was because he went from one extremity ("horn") of the world to the other,{{sfn|Van Donzel|Schmidt|2010|p=57 fn.3}} but it may ultimately derive from the image of Alexander wearing the horns of the ram-god [[Amun|Zeus-Ammon]], as popularised on coins throughout the [[Hellenistic]] Near East.{{sfn|Pinault|1992|p=181 fn.71}} The wall may have reflected a distant knowledge of the [[Great Wall of China]] (the 12th century scholar al-[[Muhammad al-Idrisi|Idrisi]] drew a map for [[Roger of Sicily]] showing the "Land of Gog and Magog" in [[Mongolia]]), or of various [[Sassanid Persia]]n walls built in the [[Caspian area]] against the northern barbarians, or a conflation of the two.{{sfn|Glassé|Smith|2003|p=39}}

Dhul-Qarneyn also journeys to the western and eastern extremities ("qarns", tips) of the Earth.{{sfn|Wheeler|2013|p=96}} In the west he finds the sun setting in a "muddy spring", equivalent to the "poisonous sea" which Alexander found in the Syriac legend. {{sfn|Ernst|2011|p=133}} In the Syriac original Alexander tested the sea by sending condemned prisoners into it, but the Quran changes this into a general administration of justice.{{sfn|Ernst|2011|p=133}} In the east both the Syrian legend and the Quran have Alexander/Dhul-Qarneyn find a people who live so close to the rising sun that they have no protection from its heat.{{sfn|Ernst|2011|p=133}}

"Qarn" also means "period" or "century", and the name Dhul-Qarnayn therefore has a symbolic meaning as "He of the Two Ages", the first being the mythological time when the wall is built and the second the age of the end of the world when Allah's [[shariah]], the divine law, is removed and Gog and Magog are to be set loose.{{sfn|Glassé|Smith|2003|p=38}} Modern Islamic apocalyptic writers, holding to a literal reading, put forward various explanations for the absence of the wall from the modern world, some saying that Gog and Magog were the Mongols and that the wall is now gone, others that both the wall and Gog and Magog are present but invisible.{{sfn|Cook|2005|p=205-206}}

==Dhul Qarnayn in later literature==

Dhul-Qarnayn the traveller was a favourite subject for later writers. In one of many Arabic and [[Persian literature|Persian]] versions of the [[Alexander the Great in legend|meeting of Alexander with the Indian sages]], the poet and philosopher [[Al-Ghazali]] (Abū Ḥāmid Muḥammad ibn Muḥammad al-Ghazālī, 1058–1111) wrote of how Dhul-Qarnayn came across a people who had no possessions but dug graves at the doors of their houses; their king explained that they did this because the only certainty in life is death. Ghazali's version later made its way into the ''[[Thousand and One Nights]]''.{{sfn|Yamanaka|Nishio|2006|p=103-105}}

The [[Sufism|Sufi]] poet [[Rumi]] (Jalāl ad-Dīn Muhammad Rūmī, 1207-1273), perhaps the most famous of medieval Persian poets, described Dhul Qarnayn's eastern journey. The hero ascends [[Mount Qaf|Mount Qof]], the "mother" of all other mountains (identified with the [[Alborz]] mountains on the northern border of [[Iran]]), which is made of emerald and forms a ring encircling the entire Earth with veins under every land. At Dhul Qarnayn's request the mountain explains the origin of [[earthquakes]]: when God wills, the mountain causes one of its veins to throb, and thus an earthquake results. Elsewhere on the great mountain Dhul Qarnayn meets [[Israfil|Esrafil]] (the [[archangel Raphael]]), standing ready to blow the trumpet on the [[Day of Judgement]].{{sfn|Berberian|2014|p=118-119}}

The Malay-language ''[[Hikayat Iskandar Zulkarnain]]'' traces the ancestry of several Southeast Asian royal families, such as the [[Sumatra]] [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] royalty,&lt;ref&gt;Early Modern History {{ISBN|981-3018-28-3}} page 60&lt;/ref&gt; from Iskandar Zulkarnain,&lt;ref name="(Malaysia)1999"&gt;{{cite book |author=Balai Seni Lukis Negara (Malaysia) |title=Seni dan nasionalisme: dulu &amp; kini |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZL-fAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Rajendra+Chola+zulkarnain&amp;dq=Rajendra+Chola+zulkarnain |year=1999 |publisher=Balai Seni Lukis Negara}}&lt;/ref&gt; through Raja [[Rajendra Chola]] (Raja Suran, Raja Chola) in the ''[[Malay Annals]]''.&lt;ref name="TasaiDjamari2005"&gt;{{cite book |author1=S.

==People identified with Dhul-Qarnayn==
[[File:100_manat._Türkmenistan,_2009_a.jpg|thumb|[[Oghuz Khan]] pictured with two horns as Zulqarnayn on a 100 [[Turkmenistan]] [[Turkmenistan manat|manat]] banknote.]]
{{also|Cyrus the Great in the Quran}}
Muslim and other commentators have identified Dhul Qarnayn with [[Alexander the Great in the Quran|Alexander the Great]],{{sfn|Netton|2006|p=72-73}} but some have objected that this cannot be so: Alexander lived only a short time, whereas Dhul-Qarnayn lived for 700 years as a sign of God's blessing; Alexander behaved very badly while Dhul-Qarnayn was a paragon; and Dhul-Qarnayn worshiped [[Allah|only one god]], while Alexander worshiped many.{{sfn|Van Donzel|Schmidt|2010|p=57 fn.2}} Other candidates have been suggested:

*[[Cyrus the Great]], the 6th century BCE [[Achaemenid Persia]]n conqueror.
*[[Imru' al-Qays ibn 'Amr|Imru'l-Qays]] (died 328 CE), a prince of the [[Lakhmids]] of southern Mesopotamia, an ally first of Persia and then of Rome, celebrated in romance for his exploits.{{sfn|Ball|2002|p=97-98}}
*"[[Messiah ben Joseph]]", a fabulous military saviour expected by [[Yemenite Jew]]s and associated in folk-lore with [[Dhu Nawas]], a semi-legendary 6th century Yemenite king.{{sfn|Wasserstrom|2014|p=61-62}}

The '''Dictionary of Art Historians''' (DAH) is an [[Internet encyclopedia project|online encyclopedia]] of topics relating to [[art historian]]s, [[art critic]]s and their dictionaries.  The mission of the project is to provide free, reliable, English-language information on published art historians.

The DAH was started in 1986 as a notecard project indexing art historians by the editors Lee R. Sorensen and Monique Daniels.&lt;ref name=DAH&gt;[http://arthistorians.info/about Mission statement and history of the DAH]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2002 the project was migrated to the internet and in 2010 the project was adopted by the art history department of [[Duke University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.wlu.edu/details.php?resID=604 Entry for the DAH] on library website of Washington and Lee university&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the project was adopted by the [http://www.dukewired.org/ Wired!

'''Diseworth''' is a village in the [[England|English]] county of [[Leicestershire]].  It is south of [[East Midlands Airport]] and off Junction 23A of the [[M1 motorway]]. 
[[File:Diseworth Village - geograph.org.uk - 1343922.jpg|thumb|The village photographed in May 2009]]
A village of some 670 residents, it is located 14 km to the north-west of Loughborough and 2.5 km to the south-east of [[Castle Donington]]. At the 2011 census the population was included in the [[civil parish]] of Long Watton and Diseworth. The settlement is in the Parish of Long Whatton and Diseworth, and lies within an undulating agricultural landscape and occupies a shallow valley created by the Diseworth Brook as it flows eastwards before becoming Long Whatton Brook and proceeding to its confluence with the River Soar.
 
The four principal streets of the village - Grimes Gate, Hall Gate, Clements Gate and Lady Gate - meet at The Cross; a staggered crossroads close to the Church of St Michael's and All Angels. Page Lane runs parallel to Lady Gate. The Green running along the southern edge of the settlement gives access into Hall Gate - via The Bowley -and into Lady Gate. Diseworth Brook flows to the south of Hall Gate and is joined by tributaries to the east of Shakespear Close and near Town End.

The famous astrologer and occultist, [[William Lilly]] was born in Diseworth in 1602.

==Diseworth Heritage Trust==
The '''Diseworth Heritage Trust''' is a [[charitable trust]], registered in the UK (No. 1112223) that is dedicated to preserving the historical and architectural heritage of the village of Diseworth in [[Leicestershire]], England, and its surrounding area, from its earliest origins to the present. The Trust was responsible for the restoration of the redundant [[Baptist]] Chapel building in Diseworth (originally built in 1752, and therefore one of the oldest in the county), as a local [[Diseworth Heritage Centre|Heritage centre]], which will provide a variety of facilities for education and entertainment. This was made possible by sponsorship from local and national organisations, including the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]]. The Trust welcomes members with a general interest in [[local history]], as well as those directly associated with the village.  The Trust works closely with the Diseworth and [[Long Whatton]] History Societies, and other organisations to develop interest in local history.

== Construction ==
The vessels mentioned by Vitruvius in his ''Ten Books on Architecture'' are made of bronze and designed specifically for each unique theater. They were then placed in niches between the theater's seats, specifically so that nothing was touching them. They used mathematical calculations to decide where they should be placed&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Brillls New Pauly CYR-EPY|last=|first=|publisher=Leiden|year=2004|isbn=|location=Boston|pages=782}}&lt;/ref&gt;. "They should be set upside down, and be supported on the side facing the stage by wedges not less than half a foot high."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

== Usage ==
Both their use in Roman times and usefulness have been debated. Thomas Noble Howe wrote in his commentary on Vitruvius' ''Ten Books on Architecture'',&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=a9ayDAAAQBAJ|page=171}}|title=The Ten Books on Architecture|last=Pollio|first=Vitruvius|date=19 July 2016|publisher=Vitruvius Pollio|isbn=978-605-04-8404-5|p=171–173}}&lt;/ref&gt; "These vessels, bronze or clay, may be another example of Vitruvius singling out a highly technical feature of Greek architecture that was uncommon, but between eight and sixteen potential sites with evidence of echea have been identified. It is debatable whether such vessels amplified or deadened sound."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ten Books on Architecture|last1=Vitruvius|date=1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-00292-9|editor1-last=Howe|editor1-first=Thomas Noble|edition=9th Printing|location=New York, NY|page=245}}&lt;/ref&gt; Echea were used with a, "due regard to the laws and [[harmony]] of physics," according to Roman writer [[Vitruvius]]. The vases operated by resonance, enhancing key frequencies of the performers' voices and absorbing those of the audience, which altered the sound in the theater to make the performers' voices clearer and more lush.&lt;ref name="AcousticalPrimer" /&gt; The size and shape of a theater determined the number of echea used, and their positioning within it.&lt;ref name="BrittonArchaeology" /&gt;

There is the possibility that echea were not used at all, as they may have never existed. Brill states that, "It is possible that Vitruvius, following the teachings on harmony by Aristoxenus, took speculation for reality."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== History ==
Vitruvius mentions a man named Lucius Mummius, who destroyed the theater of Corinth. He then brought the remains of the building's bronze echeas back to Rome. After selling the fragments, Mummius used the money to make a dedicatory offering at the temple of Luna.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Similar devices were used in early churches. Some were discovered in the vaulted ceiling of the choir of [[Strasbourg Cathedral]], as well as in [[mosque]]s dating to the 11th century.&lt;ref name="BrittonArchaeology" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AcousticalPrimer" /&gt;

In a city park in Syracuse, Italy, artist [http://www.michelespanghero.com/ Michele Spanghero] built the ''[http://www.michelespanghero.com/works/echea-aeolica/ Echea Aeolica]'' in 2015. This fiberglass and steel sound sculpture is based on the ancient echea "to create a connection to the ancient history of the land as if it leads an echo from afar."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.michelespanghero.com/works/echea-aeolica/|title=Echea Aeolica {{!}} michele spanghero|website=www.michelespanghero.com|language=it-IT|access-date=2018-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The permanent installation is interactive, encouraging viewers to use it as a listening device.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2526">'''Ermentar of Noirmoutier''', also called '''Ermentarius Tornusiensis''' (died mid-860s), was a monk and historian of the abbey of [[Church of St Philibert, Tournus|Saint-Philibert de Tournus]]. He wrote a vivid prose chronicle, ''De translationibus et miraculis sancti Filiberti'', recounting the disruption of his community by [[Viking]] raids and its transfer from the Breton island of [[Noirmoutier]] to several locations in France before it was finally settled at [[Tournus]] in 875 (after his death). It is framed around the transfer of the relics of the abbey's patron, Saint [[Philibert of Jumièges]], and the miracles he performed on the abbey's behalf.&lt;ref name=Holman&gt;Katherine Holman, ed., "Noirmoutier, Ermentarius of", ''Historical Dictionary of the Vikings'' (Scarecrow Press, 2003), pp. 195–96.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ermentar was a monk under Hilbod, who became abbot of Noirmoutier in exile around 826. The monks had begun construction on a new monastery in the villa of Déas under Hilbod's predecessor, Arnoul, who died in 824/5. It was there around 839 that Ermentar wrote his first work, the ''Vita sancti Filiberti'', a life of Saint Philibert based on an earlier seventh-century biography. In 847, the monks abandoned Déas for [[Cunault]]. In 862, they abandoned Cunault for Messay in Aquitaine, where Philibert's relics arrived on 1 May. This was the occasion when Ermentar began writing the ''De translationibus''. Abbot Hilbod died that year and was succeeded for a short time by an abbot named Ermentar. Unfortunately, there is no record of whether the abbot and the historian are one and the same. The historian had died by the mid-860s.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel C. DeSelm, ''Unwilling Pilgrimage: Vikings, Relics, and the Politics of Exile During the Carolingian Era (c. 830–940)'', PhD diss. ([[University of Michigan]], 2009), pp. 221–22, 230–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ermentar records the first Viking raid on continental Europe against his monastery in 799. According to him, from 819 the monks were forced to spend summers on the mainland because of the Vikings. In 836, they finally relocated inland permanently and in 843 the Vikings took over Noirmoutier and made it their base for a series of raids into France. Ermentar's history is a valuable, but not entirely trustworthy, source. He wrote with outrage about the ferocity of the pagans.&lt;ref name=Holman/&gt;

He achieved wide recognition in his day and—while primarily influential within the [[Continental philosophy|continental]] tradition of philosophy—has become increasingly influential in the [[Analytic philosophy|analytic]] tradition as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2014/entries/hegel/|title=Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|first=Redding|last=Paul|authorlink=Paul Redding|date=13 February 1997|publisher=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Hegel remains a divisive figure, his canonical stature within [[Western philosophy]] is universally recognized.

Hegel's principal achievement was his development of a distinctive articulation of [[idealism]], sometimes termed ''[[absolute idealism]]'',&lt;ref&gt;This term is actually quite rare in Hegel's writings. It does not occur anywhere in ''The Science of Logic'' (though he comes close in a remark on p. 124 of the [2010] di Giovanni translation, GW 21.142). In the ''Encyclopedia'' presentation of his logic it can be found only at §45R. Greraets, Suchting and Harris note in the introduction to their translation of this later text that the term is more strongly associated with English movement in that later part of the 19th century (Hackett: 1991, xiii).&lt;/ref&gt; in which the dualisms of, for instance, mind and nature and [[Subject (philosophy)|subject]] and [[Object (philosophy)|object]] are overcome. His philosophy of spirit conceptually integrates psychology, the state, history, art, religion and philosophy. His account of the [[master–slave dialectic]] has been highly influential, especially in 20th-century France.&lt;ref&gt;Overwhelmingly due to [[Alexandre Kojève]]'s influential lectures published as ''Introduction à la lecture de Hegel'' (Paris, 1947), selections translated into English by James Nichols as ''Introduction to the Reading of Hegel'' (New York, 1969). See, for instance, Aimé Patri, "Dialectique du Maître et de l’Esclave", Le Contrat Social, V, No. a (July–August 196r), 234, cited in Editor's Introduction (vii) on the extent of their influence.&lt;/ref&gt; Of special importance is his concept of spirit (''[[Geist]]'', sometimes also translated as "mind") as the historical manifestation of the logical concept and the [[Aufheben|"sublation"]] (''Aufhebung'', integration without [[Reduction (philosophy)|elimination or reduction]]) of seemingly contradictory or opposing factors: examples include the apparent opposition between nature and [[Freedom of will|freedom]] and between [[immanence]] and [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]]. Hegel has been seen in the 20th century as the originator of the [[thesis, antithesis, synthesis]] triad,&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert C. Solomon]], ''In the Spirit of Hegel'', Oxford University Press, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; but as an explicit phrase it originated with [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]].&lt;ref name=Fichte&gt;"Review of ''[[Aenesidemus (book)|Aenesidemus]]''" ([http://www.gleichsatz.de/b-u-t/trad/fichte/jgf-aenesidemus.html "Rezension des Aenesidemus"], ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Allgemeine Literatur-Zeitung|de}}'', February 11–12, 1794). Trans. Daniel Breazeale. In {{cite book| last1=Breazeale|first1=Daniel|last2=Fichte|first2=Johann|title=Fichte: Early Philosophical Writings|date=1993|publisher=Cornell University Press|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hegel has influenced many thinkers and writers whose own positions vary widely.&lt;ref&gt;"One of the few things on which the analysts, pragmatists, and existentialists agree with the dialectical theologians is that Hegel is to be repudiated: their attitude toward Kant, Aristotle, Plato, and the other great philosophers is not at all unanimous even within each movement; but opposition to Hegel is part of the platform of all four, and of the Marxists, too." [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]], [http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/us/kaufmann.htm "The Hegel Myth and Its Method"] in ''From Shakespeare to Existentialism: Studies in Poetry, Religion, and Philosophy'', Beacon Press, Boston, 1959 (pp.&amp;nbsp;88–119).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Barth]] described Hegel as a "Protestant [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]]"&lt;ref&gt;"Why did Hegel not become for the Protestant world something similar to what Thomas Aquinas was for Roman Catholicism?" (Karl Barth, ''Protestant Thought from Rousseau to Ritschl: Being the Translation Of Eleven Chapters of Die Protestantische Theologie im 19. Jahrhundert'', 268 Harper, 1959).&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] wrote that "all the great philosophical ideas of the past century—the philosophies of [[Karl Marx|Marx]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], German [[existentialism]], and [[psychoanalysis]]—had their beginnings in Hegel."&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Merleau-Ponty (trans. Herbert L. and Patricia Allen Dreyfus), ''Sense and Nonsense'', Northwestern University Press, 1964, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
=== Early years ===
==== Childhood ====
[[File:Stuttgart-Hegel-Birthplace-2006-04-09a.jpg|thumb|left|The birthplace of Hegel in [[Stuttgart]], which now houses the Hegel Museum]]
He was born on August 27, 1770 in [[Stuttgart]], capital of the [[Duchy of Württemberg]] in southwestern Germany. Christened Georg Wilhelm Friedrich, he was known as Wilhelm to his close family. His father, Georg Ludwig, was ''Rentkammersekretär'' (secretary to the revenue office) at the court of [[Karl Eugen, Duke of Württemberg]].&lt;ref name=pinkard/&gt;{{rp|2–3, 745}} Hegel's mother, Maria Magdalena Louisa (née Fromm), was the daughter of a lawyer at the High Court of Justice at the Württemberg court. She died of a "bilious fever" (''Gallenfieber'') when Hegel was thirteen. Hegel and his father also caught the disease, but they narrowly survived.&lt;ref&gt;Pinkard, ''Hegel: A Biography'', p. 3, incorrectly gives the date as September 20, 1781, and describes Hegel as aged eleven. Cf. the index to Pinkard's book and his "Chronology of Hegel's Life", which correctly give the date as 1783 (pp. 773, 745); see also [[:de:Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel#Studien und Interessen|German Wikipedia]].&lt;/ref&gt; Hegel had a sister, Christiane Luise (1773–1832); and a brother, Georg Ludwig (1776–1812), who was to perish as an officer in Napoleon's Russian campaign of 1812.&lt;ref name=pinkard/&gt;{{rp|4}}

At the age of three, he went to the German School. When he entered the Latin School two years later, he already knew the [[first declension]], having been taught it by his mother. In 1776, he entered Stuttgart's ''[[gymnasium illustre]]'' and during his adolescence read voraciously, copying lengthy extracts in his diary. Authors he read include the poet [[Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock]] and writers associated with the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], such as [[Christian Garve]] and [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]]. His studies at the ''Gymnasium'' were concluded with his ''[[Abitur]]rede'' ("graduation speech") entitled "The abortive state of art and scholarship in Turkey"&lt;ref name=pinkard/&gt;{{rp|16}} ("den verkümmerten Zustand der Künste und Wissenschaften unter den Türken").&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Rosenkranz]], ''Hegels Leben'', Duncker und Humblot, 1844, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Tübingen (1788–1793) ====
At the age of eighteen, Hegel entered the [[Tübinger Stift]] (a Protestant seminary attached to the [[University of Tübingen]]), where he had as roommates the poet and philosopher [[Friedrich Hölderlin]] and the philosopher-to-be [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cambridge Companion to Hegel |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N1ohAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover | editor=[[Frederick C. Beiser|Beiser, Frederick C.]] |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=1993 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=N1ohAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT419&amp;dq=%22Hegel%22%22Tübinger+Stift.+1789–1790+shares+a+roomwith+Hölderlin+and+Schelling+and+forms+friendship+with+them%22 419]| id={{ISBN|1-13982495-3}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sharing a dislike for what they regarded as the restrictive environment of the Seminary, the three became close friends and mutually influenced each other's ideas. All greatly admired Hellenic civilization and Hegel additionally steeped himself in [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and Lessing during this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harris|first=H.S.|title=Phenomenology and System|date=1995|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; They watched the unfolding of the [[French Revolution]] with shared enthusiasm. Schelling and Hölderlin immersed themselves in theoretical debates on [[Kantian philosophy]], from which Hegel remained aloof. Hegel at this time envisaged his future as that of a ''Popularphilosoph'', i.e. a "man of letters" who serves to make the abstruse ideas of philosophers accessible to a wider public; his own felt need to engage critically with the central ideas of Kantianism did not come until 1800.

==== Bern (1793–1796) and Frankfurt (1797–1801) ====
Having received his theological certificate (''[[consistory (Protestantism)|Konsistorial]]examen'') from the Tübingen Seminary, Hegel became ''Hofmeister'' (house tutor) to an aristocratic family in [[Bern]] (1793–1796). During this period, he composed the text which has become known as the ''[[Life of Jesus (Hegel)|Life of Jesus]]'' and a book-length manuscript titled "The Positivity of the Christian Religion". His relations with his employers becoming strained. Hegel accepted an offer mediated by Hölderlin to take up a similar position with a wine merchant's family in [[Frankfurt]], where he moved in 1797. Here, Hölderlin exerted an important influence on Hegel's thought.&lt;ref name=pinkard/&gt;{{rp|80}} While in Frankfurt, Hegel composed the essay "Fragments on Religion and Love".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www3.documenta.de/research/assets/Uploads/Hegel-Fragment-on-Love.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131008103100/http://www3.documenta.de/research/assets/Uploads/Hegel-Fragment-on-Love.pdf |archivedate=2013-10-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1799, he wrote another essay entitled "The Spirit of Christianity and Its Fate",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sunypress.edu/pdf/60921.pdf The Spirit of Christianity and Its Fate"]&lt;/ref&gt; unpublished during his lifetime.

Also in 1797, the unpublished and unsigned manuscript of "[[The Oldest Systematic Program of German Idealism]]" was written. It was written in Hegel's hand, but thought to have been authored by either Hegel, Schelling, Hölderlin, or an unknown fourth person.&lt;ref name="Hammermeister"&gt;Kai Hammermeister, ''The German Aesthetic Tradition'', Cambridge University Press, 2002, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Career years ===
==== Jena, Bamberg and Nuremberg (1801–1816) ====
In 1801, Hegel came to [[Jena]] with the encouragement of his old friend Schelling, who held the position of Extraordinary Professor at the [[University of Jena|University]] there. Hegel secured a position at the University as a ''[[Privatdozent]]'' (unsalaried lecturer) after submitting an [[inaugural dissertation]] on the orbits of the planets.&lt;ref&gt;The title of Hegel's thesis was ''Dissertatio Philosophica de Orbitis Planetarium'' (''Philosophical Dissertation on the Orbits of the Planets''); published, with a German translation by Wolgang Neuser, as ''Dissertatio Philosophica de Orbitis Planetarium / Philosophische erörterung über die Planetenbahnen'', Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the year, Hegel's first book ''[[The Difference Between Fichte's and Schelling's Systems of Philosophy]]'' was completed. He lectured on "Logic and Metaphysics" and gave joint lectures with Schelling on an "Introduction to the Idea and Limits of True Philosophy" and held a "Philosophical Disputorium". In 1802, Schelling and Hegel founded a journal, the ''Kritische Journal der Philosophie'' (''Critical Journal of Philosophy''), to which they each contributed pieces until the collaboration was ended when Schelling left for [[Würzburg]] in 1803.

In 1805, the University promoted Hegel to the position of Extraordinary Professor (unsalaried) after he wrote a letter to the poet and minister of culture [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe]] protesting at the promotion of his philosophical adversary [[Jakob Friedrich Fries]] ahead of him.&lt;ref name=pinkard&gt;{{cite book|last=Pinkard|first=Terry|title=Hegel: A Biography|date=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-49679-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|223}} Hegel attempted to enlist the help of the poet and translator [[Johann Heinrich Voß]] to obtain a post at the newly renascent [[University of Heidelberg]], but he failed; to his chagrin, Fries was later in the same year made Ordinary Professor (salaried) there.&lt;ref name=pinkard/&gt;{{rp|224–25}}

[[File:Hegel-and-Napoleon-in-Jena-1806.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|"Hegel and Napoleon in Jena" (illustration from ''Harper's Magazine'', 1895), whose meeting became proverbial due to Hegel's notable use of ''[[Weltseele]]'' ("world-soul") in reference to Napoleon ("the world-soul on horseback", ''{{lang|de|die Weltseele zu Pferde}}'')&lt;ref&gt;Note that ''Weltseele zu Pferde'' is a shortened paraphrase of Hegel's words in the letter. The letter was not published in Hegel's time, but the expression was attributed to Hegel anecdotally, appearing in print from 1859 (L. Noack, ''Schelling und die Philosophie der Romantik'', 1859, [https://books.google.ch/books?id=7NO__b_nwrsC&amp;pg=PA153 p. 153]). It is used without attribution by [[Meyer Kayserling]] in his ''Sephardim'' (1859:103), and is apparently not recognized as a reference to Hegel by the reviewer in ''Göttingische gelehrte Anzeigen'' 2 (1861) [https://books.google.ch/books?id=4zBFAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA770  p. 770], who notes it disapprovingly, as one of Kayserling's "bad jokes" (''schlechte Witze''). The phrase become widely associated with Hegel later in the 19th century, e.g. G. Baur in ''Reden gehalten in der Aula der Universität Leipzig beim Rectoratswechsel am 31. October 1874'' (1874), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=INxiAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA36#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 36].&lt;/ref&gt;]]
With his finances drying up quickly, Hegel was now under great pressure to deliver his book, the long-promised introduction to his System. Hegel was putting the finishing touches to this book, ''[[The Phenomenology of Spirit]]'', as Napoleon engaged Prussian troops on 14 October 1806 in the [[Battle of Jena]] on a plateau outside the city. On the day before the battle, Napoleon entered the city of Jena. Hegel recounted his impressions in a letter to his friend [[Friedrich Immanuel Niethammer]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;I saw the Emperor – this world-soul [''[[Weltseele]]''] – riding out of the city on reconnaissance. It is indeed a wonderful sensation to see such an individual, who, concentrated here at a single point, astride a horse, reaches out over the world and masters it.&lt;ref&gt;''{{lang|de|den Kaiser – diese Weltseele – sah ich durch die Stadt zum Rekognoszieren hinausreiten; es ist in der Tat eine wunderbare Empfindung, ein solches Individuum zu sehen, das hier auf einen Punkt kontentriert, auf einem Pferde sitzend, über die Welt übergreift und sie beherrscht.}}''Hegel, letter of  13 October 1806  to F. I. Niethammer,  no. 74 (p. 119) in ''Briefe von und an Hegel'' ed. Hoffmeister, vol. 1 (1970), cited after H. Schnädelbach in Wolfgang Welsch, Klaus Vieweg (eds.), ''Das Interesse des Denkens: Hegel aus heutiger Sicht'', Wilhelm Fink Verlag (2003),  [https://books.google.ch/books?id=NrkPdUO5VRsC&amp;pg=PA233  p. 223]; trans. Pinkard (2000:228).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Pinkard (2000) notes that Hegel's comment to Niethammer "is all the more striking since at that point he had already composed the crucial section of the ''Phenomenology'' in which he remarked that the [[French Revolution|Revolution]] had now officially passed to another land (Germany) that would complete 'in thought' what the Revolution had only partially accomplished in practice".&lt;ref&gt;Pinkard (2000:228f).&lt;/ref&gt; Although Napoleon chose not to close down Jena as he had other universities, the city was devastated and students deserted the university in droves, making Hegel's financial prospects even worse. The following February, Hegel's landlady Christiana Burkhardt (who had been abandoned by her husband) gave birth to their son Georg Ludwig Friedrich Fischer (1807–1831).&lt;ref name=pinkard/&gt;{{rp|192}}

In March 1807, Hegel moved to [[Bamberg]], where Niethammer had declined and passed on to Hegel an offer to become editor of a newspaper, the ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Bamberger Zeitung|de}}''. Unable to find more suitable employment, Hegel reluctantly accepted. Ludwig Fischer and his mother (whom Hegel may have offered to marry following the death of her husband) stayed behind in Jena.&lt;ref name=pinkard/&gt;{{rp|238}}

In November 1808, Hegel was again through Niethammer, appointed headmaster of a ''Gymnasium'' in [[Nuremberg]], a post he held until 1816. While in Nuremberg, Hegel adapted his recently published ''Phenomenology of Spirit'' for use in the classroom. Part of his remit being to teach a class called "Introduction to Knowledge of the Universal Coherence of the Sciences", Hegel developed the idea of an encyclopedia of the philosophical sciences, falling into three parts (logic, philosophy of nature and philosophy of spirit).&lt;ref name=pinkard/&gt;{{rp|337}}

In 1811, Hegel married Marie Helena Susanna von Tucher (1791–1855), the eldest daughter of a Senator. This period saw the publication of his second major work, the ''Science of Logic'' (''Wissenschaft der Logik''; 3 vols., 1812, 1813 and 1816), and the birth of his two legitimate sons, [[Karl von Hegel|Karl Friedrich Wilhelm]] (1813–1901) and Immanuel Thomas Christian (1814–1891).

==== Heidelberg and Berlin (1816–1831) ====
Having received offers of a post from the Universities of [[University of Erlangen-Nuremberg|Erlangen]], [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin]] and [[Heidelberg University|Heidelberg]], Hegel chose Heidelberg, where he moved in 1816. Soon after, his illegitimate son Ludwig Fischer (now ten years old) joined the Hegel household in April 1817, having thus far spent his childhood in an orphanage&lt;ref name=pinkard/&gt;{{rp|354–55}} as his mother had died in the meantime.&lt;ref name=pinkard/&gt;{{rp|356}}

Hegel published ''The Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences in Outline'' (1817) as a summary of his philosophy for students attending his lectures at Heidelberg.

[[File:Friedrich Hegel mit Studenten Lithographie F Kugler.jpg|thumb|Hegel with his Berlin students&lt;br&gt;Sketch by Franz Kugler]]
In 1818, Hegel accepted the renewed offer of the chair of philosophy at the University of Berlin, which had remained vacant since [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]]'s death in 1814. Here, Hegel published his ''Philosophy of Right'' (1821). Hegel devoted himself primarily to delivering his lectures; and his lecture courses on aesthetics, the philosophy of religion, the philosophy of history and the history of philosophy were published posthumously from lecture notes taken by his students. His fame spread and his lectures attracted students from all over Germany and beyond.

In 1819–1827, he made several trips to [[Weimar]] (twice), where he met Goethe, [[Brussels]], the [[Northern Netherlands]], [[Leipzig]], [[Vienna]] through [[Prague]] and [[Paris]].&lt;ref name="Siep xxii"&gt;Ludwig Siep, ''Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit'', Cambridge University Press, 2014, p. xxi.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hegel was appointed [[Rector (academia)|Rector]] of the University in October 1829, but his term as Rector ended in September 1830. Hegel was deeply disturbed by the riots for reform in Berlin in that year. In 1831, [[Frederick William III of Prussia|Frederick William III]] decorated him with the [[Order of the Red Eagle]], 3rd Class for his service to the Prussian state.&lt;ref name="Siep xxii"/&gt; In August 1831, a [[cholera]] epidemic reached Berlin and Hegel left the city, taking up lodgings in [[Kreuzberg]]. Now in a weak state of health, Hegel seldom went out. As the new semester began in October, Hegel returned to Berlin with the (mistaken) impression that the epidemic had largely subsided. By November 14, Hegel was dead. The physicians pronounced the cause of death as cholera, but it is likely he died from a different gastrointestinal disease. He is said to have uttered the last words "And he didn't understand me" before expiring.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Davies, ''[[Europe: A History]]'', 1996, p. 687.&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with his wishes, Hegel was buried on November 16 in the [[Dorotheenstadt cemetery]] next to Fichte and [[Karl Wilhelm Ferdinand Solger]].

Hegel's son Ludwig Fischer had died shortly before while serving with the Dutch army in [[Jakarta|Batavia]] and the news of his death never reached his father.&lt;ref name=pinkard/&gt;{{rp|548}} Early the following year, Hegel's sister Christiane committed suicide by drowning. Hegel's remaining two sons—[[Karl von Hegel|Karl]], who became a historian; and {{Interlanguage link multi|Immanuel Hegel|de|3=Immanuel Hegel|lt=Immanuel}}, who followed a theological path—lived long and safeguarded their father's ''[[Nachlaß]]'' and produced editions of his works.

== Philosophical work ==
{{Hegelianism}}

=== Freedom ===
Hegel's thinking can be understood as a constructive development within the broad tradition that includes [[Plato]] and [[Immanuel Kant]]. To this list, one could add [[Proclus]], [[Meister Eckhart]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], [[Plotinus]], [[Jakob Böhme]], and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]. What all these thinkers share, which distinguishes them from [[materialists]] like [[Epicurus]] and [[Thomas Hobbes]] and from [[empiricists]] like [[David Hume]], is that they regard freedom or self-determination both as real and as having important [[ontology|ontological]] implications for soul or mind or divinity. This focus on freedom is what generates Plato's notion (in the ''[[Phaedo]]'', ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' and ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'') of the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] as having a higher or fuller kind of reality than inanimate objects possess. While [[Aristotle]] criticizes Plato's "Forms", he preserves Plato's cornerstones of the ontological implications for self-determination: ethical reasoning, the soul's pinnacle in the hierarchy of nature, the order of the cosmos and an assumption with reasoned arguments for a prime mover. Kant imports Plato's high esteem of individual sovereignty to his considerations of moral and noumenal freedom as well as to God. All three find common ground on the unique position of humans in the scheme of things, known by the discussed categorical differences from animals and inanimate objects.

In his discussion of "Spirit" in his ''Encyclopedia'', Hegel praises Aristotle's ''[[On the Soul]]'' as "by far the most admirable, perhaps even the sole, work of philosophical value on this topic".&lt;ref&gt;par. 378&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''[[The Phenomenology of Spirit|Phenomenology of Spirit]]'' and his ''[[Science of Logic]]'', Hegel's concern with Kantian topics such as freedom and morality and with their ontological implications is pervasive. Rather than simply rejecting Kant's dualism of freedom versus nature, Hegel aims to subsume it within "true infinity", the "Concept" (or "Notion": ''Begriff''), "Spirit" and "ethical life" in such a way that the Kantian duality is rendered intelligible, rather than remaining a brute "given".

The reason why this subsumption takes place in a series of concepts is that Hegel's method in his ''Science of Logic'' and his ''Encyclopedia'' is to begin with basic concepts like "Being" and "Nothing" and to develop these through a long sequence of elaborations, including those already mentioned. In this manner, a solution that is reached in principle in the account of "true infinity" in the ''Science of Logic'''s chapter on "Quality" is repeated in new guises at later stages, all the way to "Spirit" and "ethical life" in the third volume of the ''Encyclopedia''.

In this way, Hegel intends to defend the germ of truth in Kantian dualism against reductive or eliminative programs like those of materialism and empiricism. Like Plato, with his dualism of soul versus bodily appetites, Kant pursues the mind's ability to question its felt inclinations or appetites and to come up with a standard of "duty" (or, in Plato's case, "good") which transcends bodily restrictiveness. Hegel preserves this essential Platonic and Kantian concern in the form of infinity going beyond the finite (a process that Hegel in fact relates to "freedom" and the "ought"),&lt;ref name=miller&gt;See ''Science of Logic'', trans. Miller [Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Humanities, 1989]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|133–136, 138}} the universal going beyond the particular (in the Concept) and Spirit going beyond Nature. Hegel renders these dualities intelligible by (ultimately) his argument in the "Quality" chapter of the "Science of Logic". The finite has to become infinite in order to achieve reality. The idea of the absolute excludes multiplicity so the subjective and objective must achieve synthesis to become whole. This is because as Hegel suggests by his introduction of the concept of "reality",&lt;ref name=miller/&gt;{{rp|111}} what determines itself—rather than depending on its relations to other things for its essential character—is more fully "real" (following the Latin etymology of "real", more "thing-like") than what does not. Finite things do not determine themselves because as "finite" things their essential character is determined by their boundaries over against other finite things, so in order to become "real" they must go beyond their finitude ("finitude is only as a transcending of itself").&lt;ref name=miller/&gt;{{rp|145}}

The result of this argument is that finite and infinite—and by extension, particular and universal, nature and freedom—do not face one another as two independent realities, but instead the latter (in each case) is the self-transcending of the former.&lt;ref name=miller/&gt;{{rp|146}} Rather than stress the distinct singularity of each factor that complements and conflicts with others—without explanation—the relationship between finite and infinite (and particular and universal and nature and freedom) becomes intelligible as a progressively developing and self-perfecting whole.

=== Progress ===
The mystical writings of [[Jakob Böhme]] had a strong effect on Hegel.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jon Mills (psychologist)|Jon Mills]], ''The Unconscious Abyss: Hegel's Anticipation of Psychoanalysis'', SUNY Press, 2002, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Böhme had written that the [[Fall of Man]] was a necessary stage in the [[evolution]] of the [[universe]]. This evolution was itself the result of God's desire for complete self-awareness. Hegel was fascinated by the works of Kant, Rousseau and [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe]] and by the [[French Revolution]]. Modern philosophy, culture and society seemed to Hegel fraught with contradictions and tensions, such as those between the subject and object of knowledge, mind and nature, [[Philosophy of self|self]] and [[Other (philosophy)|Other]], freedom and authority, knowledge and faith, or the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and [[Romanticism]]. Hegel's main philosophical project was to take these contradictions and tensions and interpret them as part of a comprehensive, evolving, rational unity that in different contexts he called "the absolute Idea" (''[[Science of Logic]]'', sections 1781–1783) or "absolute knowledge" (''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]'', "(DD) Absolute Knowledge").

According to Hegel, the main characteristic of this unity was that it evolved through and manifested itself in [[contradiction]] and negation. Contradiction and negation have a dynamic quality that at every point in each domain of [[reality]]—[[consciousness]], history, philosophy, art, nature and society—leads to further development until a [[rationality|rational]] unity is reached that preserves the contradictions as phases and sub-parts by lifting them up (''[[Aufheben|Aufhebung]]'') to a higher unity. This whole is mental because it is mind that can comprehend all of these phases and sub-parts as steps in its own process of comprehension. It is rational because the same, underlying, [[logic]]al, developmental order underlies every domain of reality and is ultimately the order of self-conscious rational thought, although only in the later stages of development does it come to full self-consciousness. The rational, self-conscious [[wikt:whole|whole]] is not a thing or [[being]] that lies outside of other existing things or minds. Rather, it comes to completion only in the philosophical comprehension of individual existing human minds who through their own understanding bring this developmental process to an understanding of itself. Hegel's thought is revolutionary to the extent that it is a philosophy of absolute negation—as long as absolute negation is at the center, systematization remains open, and makes it possible for human beings to become subjects.&lt;ref name="Schroeder2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Schroeder|title=Between Freedom and Necessity: An Essay on the Place of Value|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JfT6aQvkVfAC&amp;pg=PA104|accessdate=2012-12-17|year=2000|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=978-90-420-1302-5|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Mind" and "Spirit" are the common English translations of Hegel's use of the German "[[Geist]]". Some{{Who|date=December 2012}} have argued that either of these terms overly "psychologize" Hegel,{{citation needed|date=February 2007}} implying a kind of disembodied, solipsistic consciousness like [[ghost]] or "soul". Geist combines the meaning of spirit—as in god, ghost, or mind—with an intentional force. In Hegel's early philosophy of nature (draft manuscripts written during his time at the University of Jena), Hegel's notion of "Geist" was tightly bound to the notion of "[[Aether (classical element)|Aether]]", from which Hegel also derived the concepts of [[space]] and [[time]], but in his later works (after Jena) he did not explicitly use his old notion of "Aether" anymore.&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Gruner: "Hegel's Aether Doctrine", [[VDM Publishing|VDM Publ]]., 2010, {{ISBN|978-3-639-28451-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Central to Hegel's [[Conception (idea)|conception]] of [[knowledge]] and mind (and therefore also of reality) was the notion of [[Identity (philosophy)|identity]] in [[Subtraction|difference]]—that is, that mind [[Externalization|externalizes]] itself in various forms and [[object (philosophy)|object]]s that stand outside of it or opposed to it; and that through recognizing itself in them, is "with itself" in these external manifestations so that they are at one and the same time mind and other-than-mind. This notion of identity in difference, which is intimately bound up with his conception of contradiction and negativity, is a principal feature differentiating Hegel's thought from that of other philosophers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

=== Civil society ===
{{see also|Civil society}}
Hegel made the distinction between civil society and state in his ''[[Elements of the Philosophy of Right]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/pr/preface.htm|title=Hegel's Philosophy of Right: Preface|first=|last=Hegel, G. W. F.|website=www.marxists.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this work, civil society (Hegel used the term "''bürgerliche Gesellschaft''" though it is now referred to as ''Zivilgesellschaft'' in German to emphasize a more inclusive community) was a stage in the [[dialectical|dialectical relationship]] that occurs between Hegel's perceived opposites, the macro-community of the [[State (polity)|state]] and the micro-community of the family.&lt;ref&gt;Pelczynski, A.Z.; 1984; 'The Significance of Hegel's separation of the state and civil society' pp1-13 in Pelczynski, A.Z. (ed.); 1984; ''The State and Civil Society''; Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Broadly speaking, the term was split, like Hegel's followers, to the [[political left]] and [[political right|right]]. On the left, it became the foundation for [[Karl Marx]]'s civil society as an [[base and superstructure|economic base]];&lt;ref name="glob"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Zaleski | first = Pawel | authorlink = | title = Tocqueville on Civilian Society. A Romantic Vision of the Dichotomic Structure of Social Reality | journal = Archiv für Begriffsgeschichte | volume = 50 | issue = | pages = | publisher = Felix Meiner Verlag | location = | year = 2008 | url = | doi = | id = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; to the right, it became a description for all non-state (and the state is the peak of the objective spirit) aspects of society, including culture, society and politics. This liberal distinction between [[political society]] and [[civil society]] was followed by [[Alexis de Tocqueville]].&lt;ref name="glob" /&gt; In fact, Hegel's distinctions as to what he meant by civil society are often unclear. For example, while it seems to be the case that he felt that a civil society such as the German society in which he lived was an inevitable movement of the dialectic, he made way for the crushing of other types of "lesser" and not fully realized types of civil society as these societies were not fully conscious or aware—as it were—as to the lack of progress in their societies. Thus, it was perfectly legitimate in the eyes of Hegel for a conqueror such as Napoleon to come along and destroy that which was not fully realized.

=== State ===
Hegel's State is the final culmination of the embodiment of freedom or right (''Rechte'') in the ''[[Elements of the Philosophy of Right]].'' The State subsumes family and civil society and fulfills them. All three together are called "ethical life" (''[[Sittlichkeit]]''). The State involves three "[[wikt:moment#Noun|moments]]". In a Hegelian State, citizens both know their place and choose their place. They both know their obligations and choose to fulfill their obligations. An individual's "supreme duty is to be a member of the state" (''Elements of the Philosophy of Right'', section 258). The individual has "substantial freedom in the state". The State is "objective spirit" so "it is only through being a member of the state that the individual himself has objectivity, truth, and ethical life" (section 258). Furthermore, every member both loves the State with genuine patriotism, but has transcended mere "team spirit" by reflectively endorsing their citizenship. Members of a Hegelian State are happy even to sacrifice their lives for the State.

=== Heraclitus ===
According to Hegel, "[[Heraclitus]] is the one who first declared the nature of the infinite and first grasped nature as in itself infinite, that is, its essence as process. The origin of philosophy is to be dated from Heraclitus. His is the persistent Idea that is the same in all philosophers up to the present day, as it was the Idea of Plato and Aristotle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hegel, G. W. F.|title=Vorlesungen über die Geschichte der Philosophie|year=1979|pages=336–337|url=http://www.zeno.org/Philosophie/M/Hegel,+Georg+Wilhelm+Friedrich/Vorlesungen+%C3%BCber+die+Geschichte+der+Philosophie/Erster+Teil%3A+Griechische+Philosophie/Erster+Abschnitt.+Von+Thales+bis+Aristoteles/Erstes+Kapitel.+Von+Thales+bis+Anaxagoras/D.+Philosophie+des+Heraklit | accessdate=2008-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Hegel, Heraclitus's great achievements were to have understood the nature of the infinite, which for Hegel includes understanding the inherent contradictoriness and negativity of reality; and to have grasped that reality is becoming or process and that "being" and "nothingness" are mere empty abstractions. According to Hegel, Heraclitus's "obscurity" comes from his being a true (in Hegel's terms "speculative") philosopher who grasped the ultimate philosophical truth and therefore expressed himself in a way that goes beyond the abstract and limited nature of common sense and is difficult to grasp by those who operate within common sense. Hegel asserted that in Heraclitus he had an antecedent for his logic: "[...] there is no proposition of Heraclitus which I have not adopted in my logic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Justus | last=Hartnack |others=Lars Aagaard-Mogensen (trans.) | title=An Introduction to Hegel's Logic | year=1998 | publisher=Hackett Publishing | isbn=0-87220-424-3| pages=16–17}} Hartnack quotes Hegel, ''Lectures on the History of Philosophy'', Volume I.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hegel cites a number of fragments of Heraclitus in his ''Lectures on the History of Philosophy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Hegel, G. W. F. | title=Vorlesungen über die Geschichte der Philosophie | year=1979 | pages=319–343 | url=http://www.zeno.org/Philosophie/M/Hegel,+Georg+Wilhelm+Friedrich/Vorlesungen+%C3%BCber+die+Geschichte+der+Philosophie/Erster+Teil%3A+Griechische+Philosophie/Erster+Abschnitt.+Von+Thales+bis+Aristoteles/Erstes+Kapitel.+Von+Thales+bis+Anaxagoras/D.+Philosophie+des+Heraklit | accessdate=2008-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; One to which he attributes great significance is the fragment he translates as "Being is not more than Non-being", which he interprets to mean the following: &lt;blockquote&gt;''Sein und Nichts sei dasselbe''&lt;br&gt;Being and non-being are the same.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Heraclitus does not form any abstract nouns from his ordinary use of "to be" and "to become" and in that fragment seems to be opposing any identity A to any other identity B, C and so on, which is not-A. However, Hegel interprets not-A as not existing at all, not nothing at all, which cannot be conceived, but indeterminate or "pure" [[being]] without [[particular]]ity or specificity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Frederick Charles | last=Copleston | pages=Chapter X | year=2003 | publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group | isbn=0-8264-6901-9 | nopp=true | title=A History of Philosophy: Volume 7: 18th and 19th century German philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pure being and pure non-being or nothingness are for Hegel pure abstractions from the reality of becoming and this is also how he interprets Heraclitus. This interpretation of Heraclitus cannot be ruled out, but even if present is not the main gist of his thought.

For Hegel, the inner movement of reality is the process of God thinking as manifested in the evolution of the universe of nature and thought; that is, Hegel argued that when fully and properly understood, [[reality]] is being [[Idealism|thought]] by God as manifested in a person's comprehension of this process in and through philosophy. Since human thought is the image and fulfillment of God's thought, God is not [[Ineffability|ineffable]] (so incomprehensible as to be unutterable), but can be understood by an analysis of thought and reality. Just as humans continually correct their concepts of reality through a [[dialectic|dialectical process]], so God himself becomes more fully manifested through the dialectical process of becoming.

For his god, Hegel does not take the logos of Heraclitus but refers rather to the [[nous]] of [[Anaxagoras]], although he may well have regarded them the same as he continues to refer to god's plan, which is identical to God. Whatever the nous thinks at any time is actual [[Substance theory|substance]] and is identical to limited being, but more remains to be thought in the substrate of non-being, which is identical to pure or unlimited thought.

The universe as becoming is therefore a combination of being and non-being. The particular is never complete in itself, but to find completion is continually transformed into more comprehensive, complex, self-relating particulars. The essential nature of being-for-itself is that it is free "in itself;" that is, it does not depend on anything else such as matter for its being. The limitations represent fetters, which it must constantly be casting off as it becomes freer and more self-determining.&lt;ref&gt;The notable Introduction to ''Philosophy of History'' expresses the historical aspects of the dialectic.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Hegel began his philosophizing with commentary on the Christian religion and often expresses the view that he is a Christian, his ideas of God are not acceptable to some Christians even though he has had a major influence on 19th- and 20th-century theology.

=== Religion ===
As a graduate of a Protestant seminary, Hegel's theological concerns were reflected in many of his writings and lectures.&lt;ref&gt;"[T]he task that touches the interest of philosophy most nearly at the present moment: to put God back at the peak of philosophy, absolutely prior to all else as the one and only ground of everything." (Hegel, "How the Ordinary Human Understanding Takes Philosophy as displayed in the works of Mr. Krug", ''Kritisches Journal der Philosophie'', I, no. 1, 1802, pages&amp;nbsp;91–115)&lt;/ref&gt; Hegel's thoughts on the person of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] stood out from the theologies of the Enlightenment. In his posthumously published ''[[Lectures on the Philosophy of Religion]], Part 3'', Hegel is shown as being particularly interested with the demonstrations of God's existence and the ontological proof.&lt;ref&gt;Jon Bartley Stewart. 2008. ''[[Johan Ludvig Heiberg (poet)|Johan Ludvig Heiberg]]: Philosopher, Littérateur, Dramaturge, and Political Thinker.'' Museum Tusculanum Press. p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; He espouses that "God is not an abstraction but a concrete God&amp;nbsp;[...] God, considered in terms of his eternal Idea, has to generate the Son, has to distinguish himself from himself; he is the process of differentiating, namely, love and Spirit". This means that Jesus as the Son of God is posited by God over against himself as other. Hegel sees both a relational unity and a metaphysical unity between Jesus and God the Father. To Hegel, Jesus is both divine and human. Hegel further attests that God (as Jesus) not only died, but "[...]&amp;nbsp;rather, a reversal takes place: God, that is to say, maintains himself in the process, and the latter is only the death of death. God rises again to life, and thus things are reversed".

The philosopher [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] has argued that there was great stress on the sharp criticisms of traditional Christianity appearing in Hegel's so-called early theological writings. Kaufmann admits that Hegel treated many distinctively Christian themes and "sometimes could not resist equating" his conception of spirit (Geist) "with God, instead of saying clearly: in God I do not believe; spirit suffices me".&lt;ref&gt;Walter Kaufmann, ''Hegel: Reinterpretation, Texts, and Commentary'', Garden City, New York: Doubleday &amp; Company, 1965, pp. 276–77&lt;/ref&gt; Kaufmann also points out that Hegel's references to God or to the divine—and also to spirit—drew on classical Greek as well as Christian connotations of the terms. Kaufmann goes on:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In addition to his beloved Greeks, Hegel saw before him the example of Spinoza and, in his own time, the poetry of Goethe, Schiller, and Hölderlin, who also liked to speak of gods and the divine. So he, too, sometimes spoke of God and, more often, of the divine; and because he occasionally took pleasure in insisting that he was really closer to this or that Christian tradition than some of the theologians of his time, he has sometimes been understood to have been a Christian.&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]], ''Hegel: Reinterpretation, Texts, and Commentary'', Garden City, New York: Doubleday &amp; Company, 1965, p. 277&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Hegel himself, his philosophy was consistent with Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Jon Bartley Stewart. 2008. Johan Ludvig Heiberg: Philosopher, Littérateur, Dramaturge, and Political Thinker. Museum Tusculanum Press. p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; This led Hegelian philosopher, jurist and politician {{Interlanguage link multi|Carl Friedrich Göschel|de}} (1784–1861) to write a treatise demonstrating the consistency of Hegel's philosophy with the Christian doctrine of the immortality of the human soul. Göschel's book on this subject was titled ''Von den Beweisen für die Unsterblichkeit der menschlichen Seele im Lichte der spekulativen Philosophie: eine Ostergabe'' (Berlin: Verlag von Duncker und Humblot, 1835).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reader.digitale-sammlungen.de/de/fs1/object/display/bsb10043317_00005.html|title=MDZ-Reader  - Band  - Von den Beweisen für die Unsterblichkeit der menschlichen Seele im Lichte der spekulativen Philosophie / Göschel, Carl Friedrich|website=reader.digitale-sammlungen.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In the 1870s and 1880s, Rev. T. R. Vickroy and Susan E. Blow - who were both minor associates of the St. Louis Hegelians - independently of each other translated various chapters from Göschel's book into English, and had their translations published in ''The Journal of Speculative Philosophy''. ''The Journal of Speculative Philosophy'' (in print from 1867-1893) was the official journal of the St. Louis Philosophical Society. The St. Louis Philosophical Society - the organization which served as the hub of the St. Louis Hegelians - had been co-founded in January 1866 by 2 disciples of Hegel in America, William Torrey Harris (1835-1909) and [[Henry Conrad Brokmeyer]] (1826-1906). Rev. Thomas Rhys Vickroy (December 27, 1833 - April 19, 1904), a minister of the Methodist Episcopal Church, had been the first president (1866-1871) of Lebanon Valley College in Annville, Lebanon County, Pennsylvania. While President at Lebanon Valley College, Vickroy also held various professorships there. For example, one year he was Professor of Philosophy and the Greek Language and Literature, and another year he was Professor of Belles-Lettres and Philosophy. Susan Elizabeth Blow (June 7, 1843 - March 27, 1916) was an educator who in 1873 opened the first successful public kindergarten in the U. S. - in the Des Peres School, in the Carondelet neighborhood of St. Louis, Missouri.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jon Bartley Stewart. 2008. ''Johan Ludvig Heiberg: Philosopher, Littérateur, Dramaturge, and Political Thinker''. Museum Tusculanum Press. p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;

Hegel seemed to have an ambivalent relationship with [[Magic (supernatural)|magic]], [[myth]] and [[Paganism]]. He formulates an early philosophical example of a [[disenchantment]] narrative, arguing that Judaism was responsible both for realizing the existence of ''Geist'' and, by extension, for separating nature from ideas of spiritual and magical forces and challenging [[polytheism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Josephson-Storm | first = Jason | title = The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences | location = Chicago | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 2017 |page = 85-6 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 0-226-40336-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Hegel's manuscript "[[The Oldest Systematic Program of German Idealism]]" suggests that Hegel was concerned about the perceived decline in myth and enchantment in his age, and that he therefore called for a "new myth" to fill the cultural vacuum.&lt;ref&gt;Josephson-Storm (2017), p. 85-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Works ==
Hegel published four works during his lifetime:&lt;br&gt;
(1) ''[[The Phenomenology of Spirit]]'' (or ''The Phenomenology of Mind''), his account of the evolution of consciousness from sense-perception to absolute knowledge, published in 1807.

(2) ''[[Science of Logic]]'', the logical and [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] core of his philosophy, in three volumes (1812, 1813 and 1816, respectively), with a revised first volume published in 1831.

(3) ''[[Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences]]'', a summary of his entire philosophical system, which was originally published in 1816 and revised in 1827 and 1830.

(4) ''[[Elements of the Philosophy of Right]]'', his political philosophy, published in 1820.

During the last ten years of his life, Hegel did not publish another book, but thoroughly revised the ''Encyclopedia'' (second edition, 1827; third, 1830).&lt;ref&gt;W. Kaufmann (1980), ''Discovery of the Mind 1: Goethe, Kant and Hegel'', p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; In his political philosophy, he criticized [[Karl Ludwig von Haller]]'s reactionary work, which claimed that laws were not necessary. He also published some articles early in his career and during his Berlin period. A number of other works on the [[philosophy of history]], [[Philosophy of religion|religion]], [[aesthetics]] and the [[history of philosophy]] were compiled from the lecture notes of his students and published posthumously.

{{see also|Hegelianism}}
There are views of Hegel's thought as a representation of the summit of early 19th-century Germany's movement of philosophical [[idealism]]. It would come to have a profound impact on many future philosophical schools, including schools that opposed Hegel's specific [[dialectical idealism]], such as [[existentialism]], the [[historical materialism]] of Marx, [[historism]] and [[British idealism|British Idealism]].

Hegel's influence was immense both within philosophy and in the other sciences. Throughout the 19th century many chairs of philosophy around Europe were held by Hegelians and [[Søren Kierkegaard]], [[Ludwig Feuerbach]], [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]]—among many others—were all deeply influenced by, but also strongly opposed to many of the central themes of Hegel's philosophy. Scholars continue to find and point out Hegelian influences and approaches in a wide range of theoretical and/or learned works, such as [[Carl von Clausewitz]]'s ''magnum opus'' on strategic thought, ''[[On War]]'' (1831).&lt;ref&gt;Cormier, Youri. [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07075332.2013.859166?tab=permissions#.U9etAfldXGA "Hegel and Clausewitz: Convergence on Method, Divergence on Ethics"], ''International History Review'', Volume 36, Issue 3, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; After less than a generation, Hegel's philosophy was suppressed and even banned by the [[Prussia]]n [[right-wing]] and was firmly rejected by the [[left-wing]] in multiple official writings.

After the period of [[Bruno Bauer]], Hegel's influence did not make itself felt again until the philosophy of British Idealism and the 20th-century Hegelian [[Western Marxism]] that began with [[György Lukács]]. The more recent movement of [[communitarianism]] has a strong Hegelian influence.

=== Reading Hegel ===
Some of Hegel's writing was intended for those with advanced knowledge of philosophy, although his ''Encyclopedia'' was intended as a textbook in a [[university]] [[course (education)|course]]. Nevertheless, Hegel assumes that his readers are well-versed in [[Western philosophy]]. Especially crucial are [[Aristotle]], [[Immanuel Kant]] and Kant's immediate successors, most prominently [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]]. Those without this background would be well-advised to begin with one of the many general introductions to his thought. As is always the case, difficulties are magnified for those reading him in translation. In fact, Hegel himself argues in his ''Science of Logic'' that the German language was particularly conducive to philosophical thought.&lt;ref&gt;Hegel, G.W.F. ''Science of Logic''. trans. George di Giovanni. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. 2010. p.12&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Walter Kaufmann, the basic idea of Hegel's works, especially the ''Phenomenology of Spirit'', is that a philosopher should not "confine him or herself to views that have been held but penetrate these to the human reality they reflect". In other words, it is not enough to consider propositions, or even the content of consciousness; "it is worthwhile to ask in every instance what kind of spirit would entertain such propositions, hold such views, and have such a consciousness. Every outlook in other words, is to be studied not merely as an academic possibility but as an existential reality".&lt;ref&gt;W. Kaufmann (1966), ''Hegel: A Reinterpretation'', Anchor, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; Kaufmann has argued that as unlikely as it may sound, it is not the case that Hegel was unable to write clearly, but that Hegel felt that "he must and should not write in the way in which he was gifted".&lt;ref&gt;W. Kaufmann, 1966, ''Hegel: A Reinterpretation'', p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Left and right Hegelianism ===
Some historians have spoken of Hegel's influence as represented by two opposing camps. The [[Right Hegelians]], the allegedly direct disciples of Hegel at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität]], advocated a [[Protestant]] orthodoxy and the [[political conservatism]] of the post-[[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] Restoration period. The [[Young Hegelians|Left Hegelians]], also known as the Young Hegelians, interpreted Hegel in a [[revolutionary]] sense, leading to an advocation of [[atheism]] in religion and [[liberal democracy]] in politics.

In more recent studies, this paradigm has been questioned.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Löwith]], ''From Hegel to Nietzsche: The Revolution in Nineteenth-Century Thought'', translated by David E. Green, New York: Columbia University Press, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; No Hegelians of the period ever referred to themselves as "Right Hegelians", which was a term of insult originated by [[David Strauss]], a self-styled Left Hegelian. Critiques of Hegel offered from the Left Hegelians radically diverted Hegel's thinking into new directions and eventually came to form a disproportionately large part of the literature on and about Hegel.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

The Left Hegelians also influenced Marxism, which inspired global movements, encompassing the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]], the [[Chinese Revolution (1949)|Chinese Revolution]] and myriad revolutionary practices up until the present moment.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

20th-century interpretations of Hegel were mostly shaped by [[British idealism]], [[logical positivism]], [[Marxism]] and [[Fascism]]. According to [[Benedetto Croce]], the [[Italian Fascist]] [[Giovanni Gentile]] "holds the honor of having been the most rigorous neo-Hegelian in the entire history of Western philosophy and the dishonor of having been the official philosopher of Fascism in Italy".&lt;ref&gt;[[Benedetto Croce]], ''Guide to Aesthetics'', Translated by Patrick Romanell, "Translator's Introduction", The Library of Liberal Arts, The Bobbs–Merrill Co., Inc., 1965&lt;/ref&gt; However, since the fall of the Soviet Union a new wave of Hegel scholarship arose in the West without the preconceptions of the prior schools of thought. {{Interlanguage link multi|Walter Jaeschke|de}} and [[Otto Pöggeler]] in Germany as well as Peter Hodgson and [[Howard Kainz]] in the United States are notable for their recent contributions to post-Soviet Union thinking about Hegel.

=== Triads ===
{{main|Thesis, antithesis, synthesis}}
In previous modern accounts of Hegelianism (to undergraduate classes, for example), especially those formed prior to the Hegel renaissance, Hegel's [[dialectic]] was most often characterized as a three-step process, "[[thesis, antithesis, synthesis]]"; namely, that a "thesis" (e.g. the [[French Revolution]]) would cause the creation of its "antithesis" (e.g. the [[Reign of Terror]] that followed) and would eventually result in a "synthesis" (e.g. the [[constitutional state]] of free citizens). However, Hegel used this classification only once and he attributed the terminology to Kant. The terminology was largely developed earlier by Fichte. It was spread by [[Heinrich Moritz Chalybäus]] in accounts of Hegelian philosophy and since then the terms have been used as descriptive of this type of framework.

The "thesis–antithesis–synthesis" approach gives the sense that things or ideas are contradicted or opposed by things that come from outside them. To the contrary, the fundamental notion of Hegel's dialectic is that things or ideas have internal contradictions. From Hegel's point of view, analysis or comprehension of a thing or idea reveals that underneath its apparently simple identity or unity is an underlying inner contradiction. This contradiction leads to the dissolution of the thing or idea in the simple form in which it presented itself and to a higher-level, more complex thing or idea that more adequately incorporates the contradiction. The triadic form that appears in many places in Hegel (e.g. being–nothingness–becoming, immediate–mediate–concrete and abstract–negative–concrete) is about this movement from inner contradiction to higher-level integration or unification.

For Hegel, reason is but "speculative", not "dialectical".&lt;ref&gt;''Hegel and Language'', edited by Jere O'Neill Surber. [https://books.google.com/books?id=HFpQHr07IAkC&amp;pg=PA238 p. 238].&lt;/ref&gt; Believing that the traditional description of Hegel's philosophy in terms of thesis–antithesis–synthesis was mistaken, a few scholars like [[Raya Dunayevskaya]] have attempted to discard the triadic approach altogether. According to their argument, although Hegel refers to "the two elemental considerations: first, the idea of freedom as the absolute and final aim; secondly, the means for realising it, i.e. the subjective side of knowledge and will, with its life, movement, and activity" (thesis and antithesis), he does not use "synthesis", but instead speaks of the "Whole": "We then recognised the State as the moral Whole and the Reality of Freedom, and consequently as the objective unity of these two elements". Furthermore, in Hegel's language the "dialectical" aspect or "moment" of thought and reality, by which things or thoughts turn into their opposites or have their inner contradictions brought to the surface, what he called ''[[Aufheben|Aufhebung]]'', is only preliminary to the "speculative" (and not "synthesizing") aspect or "moment", which grasps the unity of these opposites or contradiction.

It is widely admitted today that the old-fashioned description of Hegel's philosophy in terms of thesis–antithesis–synthesis is inaccurate. Nevertheless, such is the persistence of this misnomer that the model and terminology survive in a number of scholarly works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gustav E. Mueller|editor=Jon Stewart|title=The Hegel Myths and Legends|url=|accessdate=|year=1996|publisher=Northwestern University Press|isbn=0-8101-1301-5|page=301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Renaissance ===
In the last half of the 20th century, Hegel's philosophy underwent a major renaissance. This was due to (a) the rediscovery and re-evaluation of Hegel as a possible philosophical progenitor of Marxism by philosophically oriented Marxists; (b) a resurgence of the historical perspective that Hegel brought to everything; and (c) an increasing recognition of the importance of his [[dialectical method]]. [[György Lukács]]' ''[[History and Class Consciousness]]'' (1923) helped to reintroduce Hegel into the Marxist canon. This sparked a renewed interest in Hegel reflected in the work of [[Herbert Marcuse]], [[Theodor W. Adorno]], [[Ernst Bloch]], [[Raya Dunayevskaya]], [[Alexandre Kojève]] and [[Gotthard Günther]] among others. In ''[[Reason and Revolution]]'' (1941), [[Herbert Marcuse]] made the case for Hegel as a revolutionary and criticized [[Leonard Trelawny Hobhouse]]'s thesis that Hegel was a totalitarian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Paul | last=Robinson | title=The Freudian Left: Wilhelm Reich, Geza Roheim, Herbert Marcuse | year=1990 | publisher=Cornell University Press | isbn=0-87220-424-3| page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hegel renaissance also highlighted the significance of Hegel's early works, i.e. those written before ''[[The Phenomenology of Spirit]]''. The direct and indirect influence of Kojève's lectures and writings (on ''The Phenomenology of Spirit'' in particular) mean that it is not possible to understand most French philosophers from [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] to [[Jacques Derrida]] without understanding Hegel.&lt;ref&gt;French philosopher [[Vincent Descombes]] introduced the term "post-Kojèvian discourse" to designate the period of French philosophy after the 1930s (Vincent Descombes, ''Modern French Philosophy'', Cambridge University Press, 1980, pp. 158–9).&lt;/ref&gt; American [[neoconservative]] [[political science|political theorist]] [[Francis Fukuyama]]'s controversial book ''[[The End of History and the Last Man]]'' (1992) was heavily influenced by Kojève.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Howard | last=Williams |author2=David Sullivan |author3=Gwynn Matthews  | title=Francis Fukuyama and the End of History | year=1997 | publisher=University of Wales Press | isbn=0-7083-1428-7 | pages=70–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Swiss theologian [[Hans Küng]] has also advanced contemporary scholarship in Hegel studies.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Beginning in the 1960s, Anglo-American Hegel scholarship has attempted to challenge the traditional interpretation of Hegel as offering a metaphysical system: this has also been the approach of [[Z. A. Pelczynski]] and [[Shlomo Avineri]]. This view, sometimes referred to as the "non-metaphysical option", has had a decided influence on many major English language studies of Hegel in the past forty years.

Late 20th-century literature in Western [[Theology]] that is friendly to Hegel includes works by such writers as [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] (1966), [[Dale M. Schlitt]] (1984), [[Theodore Geraets]] (1985), [[Philip M. Merklinger]] (1991), [[Stephen Rocker]] (1995) and [[Cyril O'Regan]] (1995).

Two prominent American philosophers, [[John McDowell]] and [[Robert Brandom]] (sometimes referred to as the "[[University of Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh]] Hegelians"), have produced philosophical works exhibiting a marked Hegelian influence. Each is avowedly influenced by the late [[Wilfred Sellars]], also of Pittsburgh, who referred to his seminal work ''Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind'' (1956) as a series of "incipient ''Méditations Hegeliennes''" (in homage to [[Edmund Husserl]]'s 1931 work, ''[[Cartesian Meditations|Méditations cartésiennes]]'').

Beginning in the 1990s after the fall of the Soviet Union, a fresh reading of Hegel took place in the West. For these scholars, fairly well represented by the Hegel Society of America and in cooperation with German scholars such as Otto Pöggeler and Walter Jaeschke, Hegel's works should be read without preconceptions. Marx plays little-to-no role in these new readings. Some American philosophers associated with this movement include [[Lawrence Stepelevich]], [[Rudolf Siebert]], Richard Dien Winfield and [[Theodore Geraets]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

=== Criticism ===
Criticism of Hegel has been widespread in the 19th and the 20th centuries. A diverse range of individuals including [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Søren Kierkegaard]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Bertrand Russell]], [[G. E. Moore]], [[Eric Voegelin]] and [[A. J. Ayer]] have challenged Hegelian philosophy from a variety of perspectives. Among the first to take a critical view of Hegel's system was the 19th-century German group known as the [[Young Hegelians]], which included Feuerbach, Marx, Engels and their followers. In Britain, the Hegelian [[British idealism]] school (members of which included [[Francis Herbert Bradley]], [[Bernard Bosanquet (philosopher)|Bernard Bosanquet]] and in the United States [[Josiah Royce]]) was challenged and rejected by [[analytic philosophy|analytic]] philosophers Moore and Russell. In particular, Russell considered "almost all" of Hegel's doctrines to be false.&lt;ref&gt;B. Russell, ''History of Western Philosophy'', chapter 22, paragraph 1, p. 701.&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding Hegel's interpretation of history, Russell commented: "Like other historical theories, it required, if it was to be made plausible, some distortion of facts and considerable ignorance".&lt;ref&gt;Russell, 735.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Logical positivism|Logical positivists]] such as Ayer and the [[Vienna Circle]] criticized both Hegelian philosophy and its supporters, such as Bradley.

Hegel's contemporary Schopenhauer was particularly critical and wrote of Hegel's philosophy as "a pseudo-philosophy paralyzing all mental powers, stifling all real thinking".&lt;ref&gt;On the Basis of Morality.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1820, Schopenhauer became a lecturer at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]] and he scheduled his lectures to coincide with those of Hegel, whom Schopenhauer had also described as a "clumsy charlatan".&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, Arthur. Author's preface to "On The Fourfold Root of the Principle of sufficient reason. Page 1. [[:s:On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason|On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, only five students ended up attending Schopenhauer's lectures so he dropped out of [[academia]]. Kierkegaard criticized Hegel's "absolute knowledge" unity.&lt;ref&gt;Søren Kierkegaard Concluding Unscientific Postscriptt&lt;/ref&gt; The physicist and philosopher [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] also criticized the obscure complexity of Hegel's works, referring to Hegel's writing as an "unclear thoughtless flow of words".&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Boltzmann, ''Theoretical physics and philosophical problems: Selected writings'', p. 155, [[D. Reidel]], 1974, {{ISBN|90-277-0250-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar vein, Robert Pippin wrote that Hegel had "the ugliest prose style in the history of the German language".&lt;ref&gt;Robert B. Pippin, ''Hegel's Idealism: The Satisfaction of Self-Consciousness (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1989), 5&lt;/ref&gt; Russell wrote in ''[[A History of Western Philosophy]]'' (1945) that Hegel was "the hardest to understand of all the great philosophers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|title=A History of Western Philosophy|date=1972|page=730}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karl Popper]] wrote that "there is so much philosophical writing (especially in the Hegelian school) which may justly be criticized as meaningless verbiage".&lt;ref&gt;Karl Popper, ''Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge'' (New York: Routledge, 1963), 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Popper also makes the claim in the second volume of ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'' (1945) that Hegel's system formed a thinly veiled justification for the [[Absolute monarchy|absolute rule]] of [[Frederick William III of Prussia|Frederick William III]] and that Hegel's idea of the ultimate goal of history was to reach a [[sovereign state|state]] approximating that of 1830s [[Prussia]]. Popper further proposed that Hegel's philosophy served not only as an inspiration for [[communism|communist]] and [[fascism|fascist]] totalitarian governments of the 20th century, whose dialectics allow for any belief to be construed as rational simply if it could be said to exist. Kaufmann and [[Shlomo Avineri]] have criticized Popper's theories about Hegel.&lt;ref&gt;See for instance Walter Kaufmann (1959), [http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/us/kaufmann.htm ''The Hegel Myth and Its Method'']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Isaiah Berlin]] listed Hegel as one of the six architects of modern [[authoritarianism]] who undermined [[liberal democracy]], along with Rousseau, [[Claude Adrien Helvétius]], Fichte, [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]] and [[Joseph de Maistre]].&lt;ref&gt;Berlin, Isaiah, ''Freedom and Betrayal: Six Enemies of Human Liberty'' (Princeton University Press, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

Voegelin argued that Hegel should be understood not as a philosopher, but as a "sorcerer", i.e. as a [[mysticism|mystic]] and [[Hermeticism|hermetic]] thinker.&lt;ref&gt;Voegelin, Eric (1972). "On Hegel—A Study in Sorcery", in  J. T. Fraser, F. Haber &amp; G. Muller (eds.), ''The Study of Time''. Springer-Verlag. 418--451 (1972)&lt;/ref&gt; This concept of Hegel as a hermetic thinker was elaborated by Glenn Alexander Magee,&lt;ref&gt;Magee, Glenn Alexander (2001), ''Hegel and the Hermetic Tradition'', Ithaca: Cornell University Press&lt;/ref&gt; who argued that interpreting Hegel's body of work as an expression of mysticism and hermetic ideas leads to a more accurate understanding of Hegel.&lt;ref&gt;"I do not argue that merely that we ''can'' understand Hegel as a Hermetic thinker, just as we can understand him as a German or a Swabian or an idealist thinker. Instead, I argue that we ''must'' understand Hegel as a Hermetic thinker, if we are to truly understand him at all." Magee 2001, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Periods in English History}}

The '''Georgian era''' is a period in [[British history]] from 1714 to {{circa|1830&amp;ndash;37}}, named after the [[House of Hanover|Hanoverian]] kings [[George I of Great Britain|George I]], [[George II of Great Britain|George II]], [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] and [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]]. The sub-period that is the [[Regency era]] is defined by the regency of George IV as [[Prince of Wales]] during the illness of his father George III.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/George-III |title=George III King of Great Britain |author=John Steven Watson  |website=Britannica }}&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of the Georgian era is often extended to include the relatively short reign of [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]], which ended with his death in 1837.

The term "[[wikt:Georgian|Georgian]]" is typically used in the contexts of social and political history [[Georgian architecture|and architecture]].  The term "[[Augustan literature]]" is often used for [[Augustan drama]], [[Augustan poetry]] and [[Augustan prose]] in the period 1700–1740s. The term "Augustan" refers to the acknowledgement of the influence of [[Latin literature]] from the ancient [[Roman Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;Roger D. Lund,  ''Ridicule, Religion and the Politics of Wit in Augustan England'' (Ashgate, 2013) ch 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arts==
Georgian society and its preoccupations were well portrayed in the novels of writers such as [[Henry Fielding]], [[Mary Shelley]] and [[Jane Austen]], characterised by the architecture of [[Robert Adam]], [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]] and [[James Wyatt]] and the emergence of the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style, which hearkened back to a supposed [[Golden Age|golden age]] of building design.

The flowering of the arts was most vividly shown in the emergence of the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] poets, principally through [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], [[William Wordsworth]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], [[William Blake]], [[John Keats]], [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]] and [[Robert Burns]]. Their work ushered in a new era of poetry, characterised by vivid and colourful language, evocative of elevating ideas and themes.

The paintings of [[Thomas Gainsborough]], Sir [[Joshua Reynolds]] and the young [[J. M. W. Turner]] and [[John Constable]] illustrated the changing world of the Georgian period – as did the work of designers like [[Lancelot "Capability" Brown|Capability Brown]], the [[Landscape architecture|landscape designer]].

Fine examples of distinctive Georgian architecture are Edinburgh's [[New Town, Edinburgh|New Town]], [[Georgian Dublin]], [[Grainger Town]] in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], the Georgian Quarter of [[Liverpool]] and much of Bristol and [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]].

The music of [[John Field (composer)|John Field]], [[Handel]], [[Haydn]], [[Muzio Clementi|Clementi]], [[Johann Christian Bach]], [[William Boyce (composer)|William Boyce]], [[Mozart]], [[Beethoven]] and [[Mendelssohn]] was some of the most popular in England at that time.

==Social change==
It was a time of immense social change in Britain, with the beginnings of the [[Industrial Revolution]] which began the process of intensifying [[social class|class divisions]], and the emergence of rival [[political party|political parties]] like the [[British Whig Party|Whigs]] and [[Tories (British political party)|Tories]].

In rural areas the [[British Agricultural Revolution|Agricultural Revolution]] saw huge changes to the movement of people and the decline of small communities, the growth of the cities and the beginnings of an integrated [[historic transport|transportation system]] but, nevertheless, as rural towns and villages declined and work became scarce there was a huge increase in [[emigration]] to Canada, the [[Thirteen Colonies|North American colonies]] (which became the United States during the period) and other parts of the [[British Empire]].

===Evangelical religion and social reform===
The evangelical movement inside and outside the [[Church of England]] gained strength in the late 18th and early 19th century. The movement challenged the traditional religious sensibility that emphasized a code of honor for the upper-class, and suitable behaviour for everyone else, together with faithful observances of rituals. [[John Wesley]] (1703–1791) and his followers preached revivalist religion, trying to convert individuals to a personal relationship with Christ through Bible reading, regular prayer, and especially the revival experience. Wesley himself preached 52,000 times, calling on men and women to "redeem the time" and save their souls. Wesley always operated inside the Church of England, but at his death, it set up outside institutions that became the [[Methodism|Methodist Church]].&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Armstrong, ''The Church of England: the Methodists and society, 1700–1850'' (1973).&lt;/ref&gt;  It stood alongside the traditional nonconformist churches, Presbyterians, Congregationalist, Baptists, Unitarians, and Quakers. The nonconformist churches, however, were less influenced by revivalism.&lt;ref&gt;Asa Briggs, ''The age of improvement, 1783–1867'' (1959), pp 66–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church of England remained dominant, but it had a growing evangelical, revivalist faction the "Low Church". Its leaders included [[William Wilberforce]] and [[Hannah More]]. It reached the upper class through the [[Clapham Sect]]. It did not seek political reform, but rather the opportunity to save souls through political action by freeing slaves, abolishing the duel, prohibiting cruelty to children and animals, stopping gambling, avoiding frivolity on the Sabbath; they read the Bible every day. All souls were equal in God's view, but not all bodies, so evangelicals did not challenge the hierarchical structure of English society.&lt;ref&gt;John Rule, ''Albion's People: English Society 1714–1815'' (1992) ch 2–6&lt;/ref&gt;  As R.J. Morris noted in his 1983 article "Voluntary Societies and British Urban Elites, 1780-1850," "[m]id-eighteenth-century Britain was a stable society in the sense that those with material and ideological power were able to defend this power in an effective and dynamic manner," but "in the twenty years after 1780, this consensus structure was broken."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morris|first=R.J.|date=March 1983|title=Voluntary Societies and British Urban Elites, 1780-1850: An Analysis|url=|journal=The Historical Journal|volume=26|issue=1|pages=99|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Anglican Evangelicalism thus, as historian Lisa Wood has argued in her book ''Modes of Discipline: Women, Conservatism, and the Novel After the French Revolution'', functioned as a tool of ruling-class social control, buffering the discontent that in France had inaugurated a revolution; yet it contained within itself the seeds for challenge to gender and class hierarchies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modes of Discipline: Women, Conservatism, and the Novel after the French Revolution|last=Wood|first=Lisa|publisher=Bucknell University Press|year=2003|isbn=|location=Lewisburg, PA|pages=42–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Empire==
The Georgian period saw  continual warfare, including the [[Seven Years' War]], known in America as the [[French and Indian War]] (1756–63), the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775–83), the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] (1792–1802), the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]], and the [[Napoleonic Wars]] (1803–15).  The British won most of the wars except for the American Revolution, where the combined weight of the United States, France, Spain and the Netherlands overwhelmed Britain, which stood alone without allies.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Black, ''Crisis of Empire: Britain and America in the Eighteenth Century'' (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

The loss of some of the [[Thirteen Colonies|American Colonies]] in the [[American War of Independence]] was regarded as a national disaster and was seen by some foreign observers as heralding the end of Britain as a [[great power]]. In Europe, the [[Napoleonic Wars|wars with France]] dragged on for nearly a quarter of a century, 1793–1815. Victory over [[Napoleon]] at the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] (1805) and the [[Battle of Waterloo]] (1815) under  [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Admiral Lord Nelson]] and the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] brought a sense of triumphalism and political reaction.&lt;ref&gt;Eliga H. Gould, "American independence and Britain's counter-revolution", ''Past &amp; Present'' (1997) #154 pp 107–41&lt;/ref&gt;

The expansion of empire brought fame to statesmen and explorers such as [[Robert Clive|Clive of India]] and [[James Cook|Captain Cook]], and sowed the seeds of the worldwide British Empire of the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] and [[Edwardian era]]s which were to follow.

===The trading nation===
The era was prosperous as entrepreneurs extended the range of their business around the globe. By the 1720s Britain was one of the most prosperous countries in the world, and [[Daniel Defoe]] boasted:
:we are the most "diligent nation in the world. Vast trade, rich manufactures, mighty wealth, universal correspondence, and happy success have been constant companions of England, and given us the title of an industrious people."&lt;ref&gt;Julian Hoppit, ''A Land of Liberty?: England 1689–1727'' (2000) p 344&lt;/ref&gt;

While the other major powers were primarily motivated toward territorial gains, and protection of their dynasties (such as the Habsburg and Bourbon dynasties, and the [[House of Hohenzollern]]), Britain had a different set of primary interests.  Its main diplomatic goal (besides protecting the homeland from invasion)  was building a worldwide trading network for its merchants, manufacturers, shippers and financiers.  This required a hegemonic [[Royal Navy]] so powerful that no rival could sweep its ships from the world's trading routes, or invade the British Isles.  The London government enhanced the private sector by incorporating numerous privately financed London-based companies for establishing trading posts and opening import-export businesses across the world. Each was given a monopoly of trade to the specified geographical region. The first enterprise was the [[Muscovy Company]] set up in 1555 to trade with Russia.  Other prominent enterprises included the [[East India Company]], and the  [[Hudson's Bay Company]] in Canada.  The Company of Royal Adventurers Trading to Africa  had been set up in 1662 to trade in gold, ivory and slaves in Africa; it was reestablished as the [[Royal African Company]] in 1672 and focused on the slave trade. British involvement in the each of the four major wars, 1740 to 1783, paid off handsomely in terms of trade.  Even the loss of the 13 colonies was made up by a very favorable trading relationship with the new United States of America.  British gained dominance in the trade with India, and largely dominated the highly lucrative slave, sugar, and commercial trades originating in West Africa and the West Indies. China would be next on the agenda. Other powers set up similar monopolies on a much smaller scale; only the Netherlands emphasized trade as much as England.&lt;ref&gt;Eric J. Evans, ''The forging of the modern state: early industrial Britain, 1783–1872'' (1996) p 31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ann M. Carlos and Stephen Nicholas. "'Giants of an Earlier Capitalism': The Chartered Trading Companies as Modern Multinationals." ''Business history review'' 62#3 (1988): 398-419. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3115542 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mercantilism]] was the basic policy imposed by Britain on its colonies.&lt;ref&gt;Max Savelle, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hIgl_HNozQsC&amp;pg=PA204 ''Seeds of Liberty: The Genesis of the American Mind'' (2005) pp. 204–211]&lt;/ref&gt; Mercantilism meant that the government and the merchants became partners with the goal of increasing political power and private wealth, to the exclusion of other empires. The government protected its merchants—and kept others out—by trade barriers, regulations, and subsidies to domestic industries in order to maximise exports from and minimise imports to the realm. The government had to fight smuggling, which became a favourite American technique in the 18th century to circumvent the restrictions on trading with the French, Spanish or Dutch. The goal of mercantilism was to run trade surpluses, so that gold and silver would pour into London. The government took its share through duties and taxes, with the remainder going to merchants in Britain. The government spent much of its revenue on a large and powerful Royal Navy, which not only protected the British colonies but threatened the colonies of the other empires, and sometimes seized them. The colonies were captive markets for British industry, and the goal was to enrich the mother country.&lt;ref&gt;William R. Nester, ''The Great Frontier War: Britain, France, and the Imperial Struggle for North America, 1607–1755'' (Praeger, 2000) p, 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the companies earned good profits, and enormous personal fortunes were created in India, but there was one major fiasco that caused heavy losses. The [[South Sea Bubble]] was a business enterprise that exploded in scandal. The [[South Sea Company]] was a private business corporation supposedly set up much like the other trading companies, with a focus on South America. Its actual purpose was to renegotiate previous high-interest government loans amounting to ₤31 million through market manipulation and speculation. It issued stock four times in 1720 that reached about 8,000 investors. Prices kept soaring every day, from ₤130 a share to ₤1,000, with insiders making huge paper profits. The Bubble collapsed overnight, ruining many speculators. Investigations showed bribes had reached into high places—even to the king.  The prime minister [[Robert Walpole]] managed to wind it down with minimal political and economic damage, although some losers fled to exile or committed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Hoppit, ''A Land of Liberty?: England 1689–1727'' (2000) pp 334–38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Julian Hoppit, "The Myths of the South Sea Bubble", ''Transactions of the Royal Historical Society'' (1962), 12#1 pp 141–165&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics and social revolt==
With the ending of the [[Napoleonic Wars|War with France]], Great Britain entered a period of greater economic depression and political uncertainty, characterised by social discontent and unrest. The [[Radicals (UK)|Radical]] political party published a leaflet called ''The Political Register'', also known as "The Two Penny Trash" to its rivals. The so-called [[Blanketeers|March of the Blanketeers]] saw 400 [[spinning (textiles)|spinners]] and [[Weaving|weavers]] march from [[Manchester]] to London in March 1817 to hand the Government a petition. The [[Luddite]]s destroyed and damaged machinery in the industrial north-west of England. The [[Peterloo Massacre]] in 1819 began as a protest rally which saw 60,000 people gathering to protest about their living standards, but was quelled by military action and saw eleven people killed and 400 wounded. The [[Cato Street Conspiracy]] of 1820 sought to blow up the [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]] and then move on to storm the [[Tower of London]] and overthrow the government. This too was thwarted, with the conspirators executed or [[penal transport|transported]] to Australia.

==Enlightenment==
{{Further|Age of Enlightenment}}
Historians have long explored the importance of the Scottish Enlightenment, as well as the American Enlightenment,&lt;ref&gt;Adrienne Koch, ed., ''The American enlightenment: The shaping of the American experiment and a free society'' (1965).&lt;/ref&gt; while debating the very existence of the English Enlightenment.

===Scottish Enlightenment===
{{Main|Scottish Enlightenment}}
English historian [[Peter Gay]] argues that the Scottish Enlightenment "was a small and cohesive group of friends – David Hume, Adam Smith,  Adam Ferguson, and others – who knew one another intimately and talked to one another incessantly.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay, ed.  ''The Enlightenment: A comprehensive anthology'' (1973) p 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Education was a priority in Scotland, both at the local level and especially in four universities that had stronger reputations than any in England.  The Enlightenment culture was based on close readings of new books, and intense discussions that took place daily at such intellectual gathering places in Edinburgh as [[The Select Society]] and, later, [[The Poker Club]] as well as within Scotland's [[Ancient universities of Scotland|ancient universities]] ([[University of St Andrews|St Andrews]], [[Glasgow University|Glasgow]], [[Edinburgh University|Edinburgh]] and [[Aberdeen University|Aberdeen]]).&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Daniel Eddy, "Natural History, Natural Philosophy and Readership", in Stephen Brown and Warren McDougall, eds., ''The Edinburgh History of the Book in Scotland, Vol. II: Enlightenment and Expansion, 1707–1800'' (2012),
 pp 297-309 [https://www.academia.edu/3770441/Natural_History_Natural_Philosophy_and_Readership_in_Stephen_Brown_and_Warren_McDougall_eds._The_Edinburgh_History_of_the_Book_in_Scotland_Vol._II_Enlightenment_and_Expansion_1707-1800_Edinburgh_University_of_Edinburgh_Press_2012_297-309 online]&lt;/ref&gt; Sharing the [[humanism|humanist]] and [[Rationalism|rationalist]] outlook of the [[Age of Enlightenment|European Enlightenment]] of the same time period, the thinkers of the Scottish Enlightenment asserted the importance of human reason combined with a rejection of any authority that could not be justified by reason. In Scotland, the Enlightenment was characterised by a thoroughgoing [[empiricism]] and practicality where the chief values were improvement, virtue, and practical benefit for the individual and society as a whole.  Among the fields that rapidly advanced were philosophy, economics, history architecture, and medicine. Leaders included  [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]], [[David Hume]], [[Adam Smith]], [[Dugald Stewart]], [[Thomas Reid]], [[William Robertson (historian)|William Robertson]], [[Henry Home, Lord Kames]], [[Adam Ferguson]], [[John Playfair]], [[Joseph Black]] and [[James Hutton]].  The Scottish Enlightenment influenced England and the American colonies, and to a lesser extent continental Europe.&lt;ref&gt;David  Daiches, Peter Jones, Jean Jones, eds., ''A Hotbed of Genius: The Scottish Enlightenment 1731–1790'' (Edinburgh UP, 1986).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== English Enlightenment===
The very existence of an English Enlightenment has been hotly debated by scholars.   The majority of textbooks and standard surveys make no room for an English Enlightenment. Some European surveys include England, others ignore it but do include as enlightenment intellectuals such representative Englishmen as Newton, Locke, Jonathan Swift, although they do include coverage of such major intellectuals as Joseph Addison, Edward Gibbon, John Locke, Isaac Newton, Alexander Pope, Joshua Reynolds, and Jonathan Swift.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay, ed.  ''The Enlightenment: A comprehensive anthology'' (1973) p 14&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roy Porter]] argues that the  reason for the neglect was the assumption that the movement was primarily French-inspired, that it was largely a-religious or anti-clerical, and it stood in outspoken defiance to the established order.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Porter, "England" in Alan Charles Kors, ed., ''Encyclopedia of the Enlightenment'' (2003) 1:409–15.&lt;/ref&gt; Porter admits that after the 1720s, England could claim few thinkers to equal Diderot, Voltaire or Rousseau. Indeed, its leading intellectuals, such as [[Edward Gibbon]],&lt;ref&gt;Karen O'Brien, "English Enlightenment Histories, 1750–c.1815"  in {{cite book|author=José Rabasa et al. eds.|title=The Oxford History of Historical Writing|volume=3: 1400-1800|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HcVZeiGg4awC&amp;pg=PA518|year=2012|publisher=OUP Oxford|pages=518–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edmund Burke]], and [[Samuel Johnson]] were all quite conservative and supported the standing order.  Porter says the reason was that Enlightenment had come early to England, and had succeeded so that the culture had accepted political liberalism, philosophical empiricism, and religious toleration of the sort that intellectuals on the continent had to fight for against powerful odds. The coffee-house culture provided an ideal venue for enlightened conversation. Furthermore, England rejected the collectivism of the continent, and emphasized the improvement of individuals as the main goal of enlightenment&lt;ref&gt;Roy Porter, ''The creation of the modern world: the untold story of the British Enlightenment'' (2000), pp 1–12, 36-37, 482–84.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Henri Lefebvre''' ({{IPAc-en|l|ə|ˈ|f|ɛ|v|r|ə}}; {{IPA-fr|ləfɛvʁ|lang}}; 16 June 1901&amp;nbsp;– 29 June 1991) was a French [[Marxist]] [[philosopher]] and [[sociology|sociologist]],  best known for pioneering the critique of [[everyday life]], for introducing the concepts of the [[right to the city]] and the production of [[social space]], and for his work on [[dialectics]], [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]], and criticism of [[Stalinism]], [[existentialism]], and [[structuralism]]. In his prolific career, Lefebvre wrote more than sixty books and three hundred articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Shields, Rob | title=Lefebvre Love and Struggle | publisher=Routledge | year=1999 |isbn=978-0-415-09370-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Lefebvre was born in [[Hagetmau]], [[Landes (department)|Landes]], France. He studied philosophy at the [[University of Paris]] (the Sorbonne), graduating in 1920. By 1924 he was working with [[Paul Nizan]], [[Norbert Guterman]], [[Georges Friedmann]], [[Georges Politzer]] and Pierre Morhange in the ''Philosophies'' group seeking a "philosophical revolution".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ihtp.cnrs.fr/Trebitsch/pref_lefebvre1_MT.html Michel Trebitsch: ''Introduction to Critique of Everyday Life'', Vol. 1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160608040420/http://www.ihtp.cnrs.fr/Trebitsch/pref_lefebvre1_MT.html |date=8 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This brought them into contact with the [[Surrealism|Surrealists]], [[Dada]]ists,  and other groups, before they moved towards the [[French Communist Party]] (PCF).

Lefebvre joined the PCF in 1928 and became one of the most prominent French Marxist Intellectuals during the second quarter of the 20th century, before joining the [[French resistance]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark Poster, 1975, Existential Marxism in Postwar France: From Sartre to Althusser, Princeton University Press&lt;/ref&gt;   From 1944 to 1949, he was the director of ''Radiodiffusion Française'', a French radio broadcaster in [[Toulouse]]. Among his works was a highly influential, anti-Stalinist, text on dialectics called ''Dialectical Materialism'' (1940). Seven years later, Lefebvre published his first volume of ''The Critique of Everyday Life''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.notbored.org/lefebvre-interview.html|title=Lefebvre on the Situationists: AnInterview|publisher=|accessdate=17 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His early work on method was applauded and borrowed centrally by [[Sartre]] in ''The Critique of Dialectical Reason'' (1960). During Lefebvre’s thirty-year stint with the PCF, he was chosen to publish critical attacks on opposed theorists, especially existentialists like Sartre and Lefebvre's former colleague Nizan,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radicalphilosophy.com/default.asp?channel_id=2191&amp;editorial_id=9838 Radical Philosophy obituary, Spring 1992] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030626092609/http://www.radicalphilosophy.com/default.asp?channel_id=2191&amp;editorial_id=9838 |date=26 June 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; only to intentionally get himself expelled from the party for his own heterodox theoretical and political opinions in the late 1950s. Ironically, he then went from serving as a primary intellectual for the PCF to becoming one of France’s most important critics of the PCF’s politics (e.g. immediately, the lack of an opinion on Algeria, and more generally, the  partial apologism for and continuation of [[Stalinism]]) and intellectual thought (i.e. [[Structuralism]], especially the work of [[Louis Althusser]]).&lt;ref&gt;Henri Lefebvre and Leszek Kołakowski. ''Evolution or Revolution''; F. Elders (ed.), ''Reflexive Water: The Basic Concerns of Mankind'', London: Souvenir. pp. 199–267. {{ISBN|0-285-64742-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, Lefebvre became professor of sociology at the [[University of Strasbourg]], before joining the faculty at the new university at [[University of Paris X: Nanterre|Nanterre]] in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ihtp.cnrs.fr/Trebitsch/pref_lefebvre3_MT.html|title=Préface de : Henri Lefebvre, Critique of Everyday Life.

Following the publication of this book, Lefebvre wrote several  influential works on cities, urbanism, and space, including ''The Production of Space'' (1974), which became one of the most influential and heavily cited works of [[urban theory]]. By the 1970s, Lefebvre had also published some of the first critical statements on the work of [[post-structuralists]], especially [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radicalphilosophy.com/default.asp?channel_id=2191&amp;editorial_id=9838 Radical Philosophy obituary, 1991] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030626092609/http://www.radicalphilosophy.com/default.asp?channel_id=2191&amp;editorial_id=9838 |date=26 June 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the following years he was involved in the editorial group of ''Arguments'', a [[New Left]] magazine which largely served to enable the French public to familiarize themselves with Central European revisionism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Gombin, Richard | title=The Origins of Modern Leftism |publisher=Penguin | year=1971 | isbn=978-0-14-021846-6}}, p40&lt;/ref&gt;

Lefebvre died in 1991. In his obituary, ''[[Radical Philosophy]]'' magazine honored his long and complex career and influence:
:"the most prolific of French Marxist intellectuals, died during the night of 28–29 June 1991, less than a fortnight after his ninetieth birthday. During his long career, his work has gone in and out of fashion several times, and has influenced the development not only of philosophy but also of sociology, geography, political science and literary criticism."&lt;ref&gt;''Radical Philosophy'' obituary, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The critique of everyday life==
One of Lefebvre's most important contributions to social thought is the idea of the "critique of everyday life," which he pioneered in the 1930s. Lefebvre defined everyday life dialectically as the intersection of "illusion and truth, power and helplessness; the intersection of the sector man controls and the sector he does not control",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Lefebvre, Henri | title=The Critique of Everyday Life |publisher=Verso |year=1947 | isbn=978-1844671946}}, p40&lt;/ref&gt; and is where the perpetually transformative conflict occurs between diverse, specific rhythms: the body’s polyrhythmic bundles of natural rhythms, physiological (natural) rhythms, and social rhythms (Lefebvre and Régulier, 1985: 73).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Lefebvre, Henri  |author2=Regular, Catherine | title=Rhythmanalysis|publisher=Continuum |year=2004 | isbn=978-0826472991}}&lt;/ref&gt; The everyday was in short, the space in which all life occurred, and between which all fragmented activities took place. It was the residual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ihtp.cnrs.fr/Trebitsch/pref_lefebvre1_MT.html|title=Préface à : Henri Lefebvre, Critique of Everyday Life. Volume I. Introduction|publisher=|accessdate=17 May 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160608040420/http://www.ihtp.cnrs.fr/Trebitsch/pref_lefebvre1_MT.html|archivedate=8 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the theme presented itself in many works, it was most notably outlined in his eponymous 3 volume study, which came out in individual installments, decades apart, in 1947, 1961, and 1981.

Lefebvre argued that everyday life was an underdeveloped sector compared to technology and production, and moreover that in the mid 20th century, capitalism changed such that everyday life was to be colonized—turned into a zone of sheer consumption. In this zone of everydayness (boredom) shared by everyone in society regardless of class or specialty, autocritique of everyday realities of boredom vs. societal promises of free time and leisure, could lead to  people understanding and then revolutionizing their everyday lives. This was essential to Lefebvre because everyday life was where he saw capitalism surviving and reproducing itself. Without revolutionizing everyday life, capitalism would continue to diminish the quality of everyday life, and inhibit real self-expression. The critique of everyday life was crucial because it was for him only through the development of the conditions of human life—rather than abstract control of productive forces—that humans could reach a concrete utopian existence.&lt;ref&gt;Elden, 2004, pp. 110–126.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lefebvre's work on everyday life was heavily influential in French theory, particularly for the Situationists, as well as in politics (e.g. for the May 1968 student revolts).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Ross, Kristin | title=May 68 and its afterlives|publisher=University of Chicago |year=2005 | isbn=978-0226727998}}{{page needed|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third volume has also recently influenced scholars writing about digital technology and information in the present day&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Shaw | first1 = Joe | last2 = Graham | first2 = Mark | title = An Informational Right to the City? Code, Content, Control, and the Urbanization of Information | journal = [[Antipode (journal)|Antipode]] | volume = 49 | issue = 4 | pages = 907–927 | doi = 10.1111/anti.12312 | date = February 2017 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;, since it has a section dealing with this topic at length, including analysis of the [[Nora-Minc Report]] ([[:fr:Rapport Nora-Minc|fr]]) (1977); key aspects of [[information theory]]; and other general discussion of the 'colonisation' of everyday life through information communication technologies as 'devices' or 'services'.

==The social production of space==
Lefebvre dedicated a great deal of his philosophical writings to understanding the importance of (the production of) space in what he called the reproduction of social relations of production. This idea is the central argument in the book ''The Survival of Capitalism'', written as a sort of prelude to {{lang|fr|La Production de l'espace}} (1974) (''The Production of Space''). These works have deeply influenced current urban theory, mainly within human geography, as seen in the current work of authors such as [[David Harvey]], [[Dolores Hayden]], and [[Edward Soja]], and in the contemporary discussions around the notion of [[spatial justice]]. Lefebvre is widely recognized as a Marxist thinker who was responsible for widening considerably the scope of Marxist theory, embracing everyday life and the contemporary meanings and implications of the ever-expanding reach of the urban in the western world throughout the 20th century. The generalization of industry, and its relation to cities (which is treated in {{lang|fr|La Pensée marxiste et la ville}}), ''The Right to the City'' and ''The Urban Revolution'' were all themes of Lefebvre's writings in the late 1960s, which was concerned, among other aspects, with the deep transformation of "the city" into "the urban" which culminated in its omni-presence (the "complete urbanization of society").

Lefebvre contends that there are different modes of production of space (i.e. [[spatialization]]) from natural space ('absolute space') to more complex spaces and flows whose meaning is produced in a social way (i.e. social space).&lt;ref&gt;''Place, A Short Introduction'' by Tim Cresswell&lt;/ref&gt;  Lefebvre analyses each historical mode as a three-part dialectic between everyday practices and perceptions ({{lang|fr|le perçu}}), representations or theories of space ({{lang|fr|le conçu}}) and the spatial [[The Imaginary (psychoanalysis)#French culture|imaginary]] of the time ({{lang|fr|le vécu}}).&lt;ref&gt;Shields, Rob, ''Places on the Margin'', Routledge, 1991, {{ISBN|0-415-08022-3}}, pp. 50–58.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lefebvre's argument in ''The Production of Space'' is that space is a social product, or a complex social construction (based on values, and the social production of meanings) which affects spatial practices and perceptions. This argument implies the shift of the research perspective from space to processes of its production; the embrace of the multiplicity of spaces that are socially produced and made productive in social practices; and the focus on the contradictory, conflictual, and, ultimately, political character of the processes of production of space.&lt;ref&gt;Stanek, Lukasz, ''Henri Lefebvre on Space: Architecture, Urban Research, and the Production of Theory'', [[University of Minnesota Press]], 2011, p. ix.&lt;/ref&gt; As a Marxist theorist (but highly critical of the economic structuralism that dominated the academic discourse in his period), Lefebvre argues that this social production of urban space is fundamental to the reproduction of society, hence of capitalism itself. The social production of space is commanded by a [[hegemonic]] class as a tool to reproduce its dominance (see [[Antonio Gramsci]]).

{{Quote|(Social) space is a (social) product&amp;nbsp;[...] the space thus produced also serves as a tool of thought and of action&amp;nbsp;[...] in addition to being a means of production it is also a means of control, and hence of domination, of power.&lt;ref&gt;Lefebvre, Henri, ''The Production of Space'', Blackwell, 1991, {{ISBN|0-631-18177-6}}. p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Lefebvre argued that every society—and, therefore, every mode of production—produces a certain space, its own space. The city of the ancient world cannot be understood as a simple agglomeration of people and things in space—it had its own spatial practice, making its own space (which was suitable for itself—Lefebvre argues that the intellectual climate of the city in the ancient world was very much related to the social production of its spatiality). Then if every society produces its own space, any "social existence" aspiring to be or declaring itself to be real, but not producing its own space, would be a strange entity, a very peculiar abstraction incapable of escaping the ideological or even cultural spheres. Based on this argument, Lefebvre criticized Soviet urban planners on the basis that they failed to produce a socialist space, having just reproduced the modernist model of urban design (interventions on physical space, which were insufficient to grasp social space) and applied it onto that context:

{{Quote|Change life! Change Society! These ideas lose completely their meaning without producing an appropriate space. A lesson to be learned from soviet constructivists from the 1920s and 30s, and of their failure, is that new social relations demand a new space, and vice-versa.&lt;ref&gt;Lefebvre, Henri ''The Production of Space'', Blackwell, 1991, {{ISBN|0-631-18177-6}}. p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Criticism and response ===
In his book ''The Urban Question'', [[Manuel Castells]] criticizes Lefebvre's [[Marxist Humanism]] and approach to the city influenced by [[Hegel]] and [[Nietzsche]]. Castells' political criticisms of Lefebvre's approach to Marxism echoed the Structuralist ''Scientific Marxism'' school of Louis Althusser of which Lefebvre was an immediate critic. Many responses to Castells are provided in ''The Survival of Capitalism'', and some may argue {{who|date=May 2010}} that the acceptance of those critiques in the academic world would be a motive for Lefebvre's effort in writing the long and theoretically dense ''The Production of Space''.

The '''Heyward Shepherd memorial''' was erected in 1931 by the [[United Daughters of the Confederacy]]. It commemorates Heyward (sometimes spelled "Hayward") Shepherd (1825–October 16, 1859), a free black man, who was the first person killed during [[John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry]].
[[File:Heyward shepherd, a black porter who was the first killed during John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry.jpg|thumb|This is from a 1906 book by Elijah Avey, ''The Capture and Execution of John Brown''. The author says he was an eyewitness. It is not known if it was the author who himself made the drawing.]]

==Heyward Shepherd==
Heyward Shepherd was a free black man who lived in [[Winchester, Virginia]], about {{convert|30|mi}} from Harpers Ferry. He owned property there, a small house, and had a wife and five children, according to the 1860 census. "It is unclear whether Shepherd was born a free man or was an emancipated slave because various anecdotal references present different opinions on that subject."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article

He had a job as a porter or baggage handler with the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]], and worked on the trains going back and forth through Harpers Ferry, an important rail junction. When the stationmaster was absent, he was in charge of the station. During the early hours of the raid on October 16, 1859, he recognized Brown's party, and tried to warn the town instead of helping the liberators. The raiders unexpectedly met Heyward, and ordered him to stop when he turned to run. When he failed to stop, he was shot in the back and/or the head, and killed. He was buried in the Winchester-Fairfax Colored Cemetery, without a grave marker. He was "accorded public honors by the state of Virginia, his funeral being attended by a detachment of the Virginia State militia."&lt;ref&gt;

===1931 Monument===
In 1931 a monument to Shepherd {{nowrap|({{coord|39.32330|-77.73005|format=dms|type:landmark_region:US-WV|display=inline}})}} was erected by both the [[Sons of Confederate Veterans]] and the [[United Daughters of the Confederacy]]. The text of the granite monument read: &lt;blockquote&gt;On the night of October 16, 1859, Heyward Shepherd, an industrious and respected colored freeman, was mortally wounded by John Brown's raiders, in pursuance of his duties as an employee of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company, he became the first victim of this attempted insurrection. This boulder is erected by the United Daughters of the Confederacy and the Sons of Confederate Veterans as a memorial to Heyward Shepherd, exemplifying the character and faithfulness of thousands of Negros who under many temptations throughout subsequent years of war. So conducted themselves that no stain was left upon a record which is the peculiar heritage of the American people, and an everlasting tribute to the best in both races.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===1932 Plaque===
The monument was immediately challenged by many as perpetuating the "faithful slave" concept of slavery as a justification for the practice.

The NAACP responded by preparing a plaque to be displayed at [[Storer College]] in Harpers Ferry, where the firehouse used by John Brown as a fort had been placed. The president of the college refused to allow the plaque to be mounted because of the militant text. In 2006 the plaque was finally placed on the side of the firehouse. The text of the plaque reads:&lt;blockquote&gt; HERE JOHN BROWN AIMED AT HUMAN SLAVERY A BLOW THAT WOKE A GUILTY NATION. WITH HIM FOUGHT SEVEN SLAVES AND SONS OF SLAVES. OVER HIS CRUCIFIED CORPSE MARCHED 200,000 BLACK SOLDIERS AND 4,000,000 FREEDMEN SINGING  "JOHN BROWN'S BODY LIES A-MOULDERING IN THE GRAVE BUT HIS SOUL GOES MARCHING ON!" IN GRATITUDE THIS TABLET IS ERECTED THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF COLORED PEOPLE MAY 21, 1932&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===1955 Plaque===
A plaque to contexualize the original 1931 monument was placed in 1955 by the National Park Service. The text of the plaque read: &lt;blockquote&gt;John Brown’s raid on the armory at Harpers Ferry caused the death of four townspeople. One of those died in the fighting was Heyward Shepherd, a railroad baggagemaster and a free black. Although the true identity of his assailant is uncertain, Shepherd soon became a symbol of the "faithful servant" among those who deplored Brown’s action against the traditional southern way of life. This monument, placed here in 1931, reflects those traditional views.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===1994 Plaque===
Another plaque was installed near the 1931 monument to place the monument in context by the National Park Service. It reads: &lt;blockquote&gt;On October 17, 1859, abolitionist John Brown attacked Harpers Ferry to launch a war against slavery. Heyward Shepherd, a free African-American railroad baggage master, was shot and killed by Brown’s men shortly after midnight. Seventy-two years later, on October 10, 1931, a crowd estimated to 300 whites and 100 blacks gathered to unveil and dedicate the Shepherd Monument. During the ceremony, voices rose to praise and denounce the monument. Conceived around the turn of the century, the monument endured controversy. In 1905, the United Daughters of the Confederacy stated that erecting the monument would influence for good the present and coming generations, and prove that the people of the South who owned slaves valued and respected their good qualities as no one else ever did or will do.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Penn Station2.jpg|thumb|[[Demolition]] of the former [[Pennsylvania Station (1910–1963)|Penn Station]] concourse raised public awareness about preservation]]
&lt;!--the term historic preservation is seemingly almost exclusively found in United States English; other terms are used in other English speaking cultures, though certain non-English phrases may directly transliterate as "Historic Preservation"; as a result of the ambiguous usage of the term, this was chosen as the primary article; other potential meanings are referenced in the hatnote; see discussion pages for details.--&gt;

'''Historic preservation''' (US), '''heritage preservation''' or '''heritage conservation''' (UK), is an endeavour that seeks to preserve, conserve and protect buildings, objects, landscapes or other artifacts of historical significance.
This term refers specifically to the preservation of the built environment, and not to preservation of, for example, primeval forests or wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;Maryland Association of Historic District Commissions, ''[http://www.mahdc.org/index.php/library-of-resources Handbook] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727055105/http://www.mahdc.org/index.php/library-of-resources |date=2011-07-27 }}'' (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===England===
In [[England]], [[Antiquary|antiquarian]] interests were a familiar gentleman's pursuit since the mid 17th century, developing in tandem with the rise in scientific curiosity. Fellows of the [[Royal Society]] were often also Fellows of the [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Society of Antiquaries]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}.

[[File:Castle Berkhamsted cz.jpg|thumb|alt=Picture of Berkhamsted from the Norman Castle's Motte|The ruins of Berkhamsted castle (viewed from its Norman motte) and Berkhamsted Common were the location of two successful early preservation events in the nineteenth century. (Enlarged: A train passes Berkhamsted castle, on an embankment that was once part of the castle's outer defences.)]]Many historic sites were damaged as the railways began to spread across the UK; including [[Trinity College Kirk|Trinity Hospital]] and its church in Edinburgh, [[Furness Abbey]], [[Berwick Castle|Berwick]] and [[Northampton Castle]], and the ancient walls of York, Chester and Newcastle. In 1833 [[Berkhamsted Castle]] became the first historic site in England officially protected by statute under the London and Birmingham Railway Acts of 1833{{ndash}}1837, though the new railway line in 1834 did demolish the castle's gatehouse and outer earthworks to the south.&lt;ref name="Wheeler1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Wheeler|title=Ruskin and Environment: The Storm-cloud of the Nineteenth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pNxRAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA125|date=1 January 1995|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-0-7190-4377-2|pages=125–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another early preservation event also occurred at [[Berkhamsted]]. In 1866, Lord Brownlow who lived at [[Ashridge]], tried to enclose the adjoining Berkhamsted Common with {{convert|5|ft|m|0|adj=on}} steel fences in an attempt to claim it as part of his estate. In England from early Anglo-Saxon times, [[Common land]] was an area of land which the local community could use as a resource. Across England between 1660 and 1845, 7 million acres of Common land had been [[enclosure|enclosed]] by private land owners by application to parliament. On the night of 6 March 1866, [[Augustus Smith (politician)|Augustus Smith]] MP led gangs of local folk and hired men from London's East End in [[direct action]] to break the enclosure fences and protect Berkhamsted Common for the people of Berkhamsted in what became known nationally as the Battle of Berkhamsted Common.&lt;ref name=Cobb1893p26&gt;{{harvnb|Cobb|1883|p=26}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sherwood2006p245&gt;{{harvnb|Sherwood|2008|p=245}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Birtchnell1988psNone&gt;{{harvnb|Birtchnell|1988|ps=none}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1870, [[Robert Hunter (National Trust)|Sir Robert Hunter]] (later co-founder of the [[National Trust]] in 1895) and the [[Commons Preservation Society]] succeed in legal action that ensured protection of Berkhamsted Common and other open spaces threatened with enclosure. In 1926 the common was acquired by the National Trust.&lt;ref name="commons"&gt;{{cite news|title=Mr. Shaw-Lefevre on the Preservation of Commons|newspaper=The Times|date=11 December 1886|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ashbrook |first=Kate |url=http://commons.ncl.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Kate-Ashbrook.pdf|title=Modern commons: a protected open space?|accessdate=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hemeltoday.co.uk/news/more-news/exhibition-and-commemorative-walk-marks-anniversary-of-battle-to-save-berkhamsted-common-1-7006636 | title=Exhibition and commemorative walk marks anniversary of battle to save Berkhamsted Common | publisher=Johnston Publishing Ltd. | work=Hemel Gazette | date=12 October 2015 | accessdate=14 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:John Lubbock72.jpg|thumb|right|200x200px|[[John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury|John Lubbock]], MP was a moving force behind the implementation of the Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1882.]]By the mid 19th century, much of [[UK|Britain's]] unprotected cultural heritage was being slowly destroyed. Even well-meaning archaeologists like [[William Greenwell]] excavated sites with virtually no attempt at their preservation, [[Stonehenge]] came under increasing threat by the 1870s. Tourists were chipping off parts of the stones or carving their initials into the rock. The private owners of the monument decided to sell the land to the [[London and South-Western Railway]] as the monument was "not the slightest use to anyone now"{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}. [[John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury|John Lubbock]], an MP and botanist emerged as the champion of the country's national heritage. In 1872 he personally bought private land that housed ancient monuments in [[Avebury]], [[Silbury Hill]] and elsewhere, from the owners who were threatening to have them cleared away to make room for housing. Soon, he began campaigning in Parliament for legislation to protect monuments from destruction. This finally led to the legislative milestone under the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] government of [[William Gladstone]] of the [[Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1882]]. The first government appointed inspector for this job was the archaeologist [[Augustus Pitt-Rivers]]. This legislation was regarded by conservative political elements as a grave assault on the individual rights of property of the owner, and consequently, the inspector only had the power to identify endangered landmarks and offer to purchase them from the owner with his consent. The Act only covered ancient monuments and explicitly did not cover historic buildings or structures. In 1877 the [[Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings]] was founded by the [[Arts and Crafts]] designer [[William Morris]] to prevent the destruction of historic buildings, followed by the [[National Trust]] in 1895 that bought estates from their owners for preservation.&lt;ref&gt;Bryson, Bill. "At Home: A Short History of Private Life" Transworld Publishers, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1882]] had only given legal protection to prehistoric sites, such as ancient [[tumulus|tumuli]]. The [[Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1900]] took this further by empowering the government's Commissioners of Work and local County Councils to protect a wider range of properties. Further updates were made in [[Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1910|1910]].

[[File:Tattershall Castle, 2006.jpg|left|200px|upright|thumbnail|[[Tattershall Castle, Lincolnshire|Tattershall Castle]], preserved at personal expense by [[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Lord Curzon]] and a catalyst for [[Ancient Monuments Consolidation and Amendment Act 1913|broader heritage protection laws]].]]
[[Tattershall Castle, Lincolnshire|Tattershall Castle]], [[Lincolnshire]], a medieval [[manor house]] had been put up for sale in 1910 with its greatest treasures, the huge medieval fireplaces, still intact. However, when an American bought the house they were ripped out and packaged up for shipping. The former viceroy of [[India]], [[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston]], was outraged at this cultural destruction and stepped in to buy back the castle and reinstall the fireplaces. After a nationwide hunt for them they were finally found in London and returned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-21587468|title=The man who demolished Shakespeare's house|publisher=BBC News Magazine|author=Denise Winterman}}&lt;/ref&gt; He restored the castle&lt;ref name=Adrian&gt;{{cite book|title=English Castles: A Guide by Counties|publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer|author=Adrian Pettifer|pages=145–7|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; and left it to the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] on his death in 1925. His experience at Tattershall influenced Lord Curzon to push for tougher heritage protection laws in Britain, which saw passage as the [[Ancient Monuments Consolidation and Amendment Act 1913]].

The new structure involved the creation of the Ancient Monuments Board to oversee the protection of such monuments. Powers were given for the board, with Parliamentary approval, to issue preservation orders to protect monuments, and extended the public right of access to these. The term "monument" was extended to include the lands around it, allowing the protection of the wider landscape.&lt;ref&gt;Mynors, p.9.&lt;/ref&gt;

====The National Trust====
{{one source section|date=October 2017}}
The [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] was founded in 1894 by [[Octavia Hill]], [[Robert Hunter (National Trust)|Sir Robert Hunter]], and [[Hardwicke Rawnsley|Hardwicke Canon Rawnsley]] as the first organisation of its type in the world. Its formal purpose is: &lt;blockquote&gt;The preservation for the benefit of the Nation of lands and [[Tenement (law)|tenements]] (including buildings) of beauty or historic interest and, as regards lands, for the preservation of their natural aspect, features and animal and plant life. Also the preservation of furniture, pictures and chattels of any description having national and historic or artistic interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/documents/download-national-trust-acts-1907-1971-post-order-2005.pdf | title=The National Trust Acts  1907 - 1971, as varied by a Parliamentary Scheme implemented by  The Charities (National Trust) Order 2005 | publisher=[[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] | accessdate=10 November 2017 | pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the early days, the Trust was concerned primarily with protecting open spaces and a variety of threatened buildings; its first property was [[Alfriston Clergy House]] and its first [[nature reserve]] was [[Wicken Fen]]. Its first archaeological monument was [[White Barrow]]. The focus on [[English country house|country houses]] and gardens, which now comprise the majority of its most visited properties, came about in the mid 20th century, when it was realised that the private owners of many of these properties were no longer able to afford to maintain them.

The Town and Country Planning Act 1944 and the [[Town and Country Planning Act 1990]] took steps toward historic preservation on an unprecedented scale.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} Concern about the demolition of historic buildings arose in institutions such as the pressure group [[the Society for the Preservation of Historic Buildings]], which appealed against demolition and neglect on a case by case basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sphb.org.uk |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821104238/http://www.sphb.org.uk/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-08-21 |title=The Society for the Preservation of Historic Buildings (SPHB)|publisher=sphb.org.uk|accessdate=2012-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====English Heritage====
[[English Heritage]] formed in 1983, is a registered charity that looks after the National Heritage Collection in England.&lt;ref name="New Era EH"&gt;{{cite web|title=New Era for English Heritage|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/about-us/search-news/new-era-for-englands-heritage1|website=English Heritage|publisher=English Heritage Trust|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This comprises over 400 of England's historic buildings, monuments and sites spanning more than 5,000 years of history. Within its portfolio are [[Stonehenge]], [[Dover Castle]], [[Tintagel Castle]] and the best preserved parts of [[Hadrian's Wall]].

Originally English Heritage was the operating name of an executive [[non-departmental public body]] of the [[Her Majesty's Government|British Government]], officially titled the [[Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission for England]], that ran the national system of heritage protection and managed a range of historic properties.&lt;ref name="EH History"&gt;{{cite web|title=Our History|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/about-us/our-history/|website=English Heritage|publisher=English Heritage Trust|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was created to combine the roles of existing bodies that had emerged from a long period of state involvement in heritage protection. In 1999 the organisation merged with the [[Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England]] and the National Monuments Record (England), bringing together resources for the identification and survey of England's historic environment. On 1 April 2015, English Heritage was divided into two parts: [[Historic England]], which inherited the statutory and protection functions of the old organisation, and the new [[English Heritage Trust]], a charity that would operate the historic properties, and which took on the English Heritage operating name and logo.&lt;ref name="New Era EH"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EH History"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Telegraph EHT"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lean|first1=Geoffrey|title=Does our history have a future in the hands of the English Heritage Trust?|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/environment/conservation/11441254/Does-our-history-have-a-future-in-the-hands-of-the-English-Heritage-Trust.html|accessdate=6 April 2015|work=The Telegraph|date=28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British government gave the new charity an £80 million grant to help establish it as an independent trust, although the historic properties remained in the ownership of the state.

[[File:MountVernonrear.jpg|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;[[Mount Vernon]] [[plantations in the American South|plantation]], near [[Alexandria, Virginia]]&lt;/center&gt;]]
In the United States one of the first historic preservation efforts was the
[[Washington's Headquarters State Historic Site]], in [[Newburgh, New York]]. This property has the distinction of being the first-ever property designated and operated as a historic site by a U.S. state, having been so since 1850.

Another early historic preservation undertaking was that of George Washington's [[Mount Vernon]] in 1858.&lt;ref&gt;Lea, Diane. "America's Preservation Ethos: A Tribute to Enduring Ideals." ''A Richer Heritage: Historic Preservation in the Twenty-First Century.'' ed. Robert Stipe. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2003. p.2&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 1889, the Richmond, Virginia-based [[Preservation Virginia]] (formerly known as the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities) was the United States' first statewide historic preservation group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Helium Studio |url=http://apva.org/aboutus/ |title=Preservation Virginia |publisher=Apva.org |date= |accessdate=2012-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008020715/http://www.apva.org/AboutUs/ |archivedate=2012-10-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lindgren, James Michael. ''Preserving the Old Dominion: historic preservation and Virginia traditionalism''. Charlottesville: University Press of Virginia, 1993. 3. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Scenic and Historic Preservation Society]] was formed in 1895 as the first American organization of its kind in the United States that did not limit its activities to a single historic place or object. The Society operated as a national organization to: protect the natural scenery and the preservation of historic landmarks; to preserve landmarks and records of the past or present; to erect memorials and promote appreciation of the scenic beauty of America.&lt;ref&gt;"Scenic and Historic America: Bulletin of the American Scenic and Historic Preservation Society." ASHPS 2.1 (March 1930):3.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles E. Peterson]] was an influential figure in the mid-20th century establishing the [[Historic American Buildings Survey]] (HABS), advising on the establishment of [[Independence National Historical Park]], helping with the first graduate degree program in historic preservation in the United States at [[Columbia University]], and author.

The architectural firm of Simons &amp; Lapham (Albert Simons and [[Samuel Lapham VI|Samuel Lapham]]) was an influential supporter of the nation's first historic preservation ordinance in [[Charleston, South Carolina]] in 1930, affording that city a regulatory means by which to prevent the destruction of its historic building stock. In 1925, efforts to preserve the historic buildings of the [[French Quarter]] in [[New Orleans]] led to the creation of the Vieux Carré Commission and later, to the adoption of a historic preservation ordinance.&lt;ref&gt;Blevins, ''Documentation of the Architecture of the Architecture of Samuel Lapham and the Firm of Simons &amp; Lapham'', Masters of Fine Arts in Historic Preservation Thesis, Savannah College of Art &amp; Design, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, Scott S.

[[File:1601 14th Street NW montage.jpg|thumb|left|350px|The preservation of this historic building in Washington, D.C. resulted in an award for Excellence in Historic Preservation by the local government.&lt;ref name=award&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dgs.dc.gov/release/dgs-mayor-gray-announces-winners-historic-preservation-awards |title=Mayor Gray Announces Winners of Historic Preservation Awards |publisher=Government of the District of Columbia |accessdate=October 22, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The US [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]], another privately funded [[non-profit organization]], began in 1949 with a handful of structures and has developed goals that provide "leadership, education, advocacy, and resources to save America's diverse historic places and revitalize our communities" according to the Trust's mission statement.  In 1951 the Trust assumed responsibility for its first museum property, [[Woodlawn Plantation]] in [[northern Virginia]]. Twenty-eight sites in all have subsequently become part of the National Trust, representing the [[cultural diversity]] of American history.  In New York City, the destruction of [[Pennsylvania Station (1910–1963)|Pennsylvania Station]] in 1964 shocked many nationwide into supporting preservation. The 1960s proved advantageous with new laws and international agreements extending preservation "from ancient monuments to whole districts and buildings a few decades old."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abramson|first=Daniel|year=2012|title=From Obsolescence to Sustainability, Back Again, and Beyond|url=|journal=Design and Culture|volume=4|issue=3|pages=279–298|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On an international level, the New York-based [[World Monuments Fund]] was founded in 1965 to preserve historic sites all over the world.

Under the direction of [[James Marston Fitch]], the first advanced-degree historic preservation program began at [[Columbia University]] in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;Murtagh, William J. ''Keeping Time: The History and Theory of Preservation in America''. New York: Sterling Publishing, Co., 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; It became the model on which most other graduate historic preservation programs were created.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Tomlan.

===Canada===
{{Main|Heritage conservation in Canada}}
In [[Canada]], the phrase "heritage preservation" is sometimes seen as a specific approach to the treatment of historic places and sites, rather than a general concept of conservation. "Conservation" is taken as the more general term, referring to all actions or processes that are aimed at safeguarding the character-defining elements of a cultural resource so as to retain its heritage value and extend its physical life.

Historic objects in Canada may be granted special designation by any of the three levels of government: the [[Government of Canada|central government]], the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provincial governments]], or a [[local government in Canada|municipal government]].
The [[Heritage Canada Foundation]] acts as Canada's lead advocacy organisation for heritage buildings and landscapes.

=== The Netherlands ===
[[Victor de Stuers]] is widely considered the man who started historic preservation in the Netherlands. In 1875 the first national department for conservation was established&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://arthistorians.info/stuersv|title=Dictionary of Art Historians|website=arthistorians.info|access-date=2017-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and de Stuers was  appointed as the first legal secretary at the Ministry of Home Affairs as chief of the brand new Department of Arts and Sciences. He was the driving force behind ''[[Monumentenzorg]]'' (Foundation for Historic Preservation), helped found the ''[[Rijksmuseum]]'' (National Museum) and the ''Rijksarchief'' (National Archives).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kerkindenhaag.nl/agendaberichten/victor-de-stuers-vader-van-monumentenzorg-en-rijksmuseum/|title=Victor de Stuers, vader van Monumentenzorg en Rijksmuseum - Kerk in Den Haag|website=www.kerkindenhaag.nl|language=nl|access-date=2017-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://resources.huygens.knaw.nl/bwn1880-2000/lemmata/bwn1/stuers|title=Stuers, jhr.

However, it was not until the 20th century that there was national legislation on historic preservation. In 1961 the [[:nl:Monumentenwet|''Monumentenwet'']] (“Monuments Act”) was passed. It defined that any physical building or space that was at least fifty years old and “which are of general interest because of their beauty, their meaning to science or their social value” and must thus be preserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/till014sche01_01/till014sche01_01_0031.php|title=J.A.C.

In 1973, the NGO ''Monumentenwacht'' (“Monument Watch”) was founded with the purpose of providing preventative measures of maintenance for historic buildings. As the majority of the historic preservation programs in the Netherlands, this program is decentralized, managed on the provincial level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wcmt.org.uk/sites/default/files/migrated-reports/629_1.pdf|title=Devlin, H. (2005). European initiatives in preventative maintenance for historic buildings. Retrieved from www.wcmt.org.uk|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owners of heritage buildings can subscribe to the services of Monumentenwacht and receive regular visits for inspection. The costs are covered through a combination of national and provincial subsidies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Weaver |first=Martin E. |authorlink=Martin E. Weaver |title=Historic Preservation Maintenance in the Netherlands: The Monumentenwacht |journal=[[Bulletin of the Association for Preservation Technology]] |volume=18 |issue=18 |date=1986 |pages=10-11 |doi=10.2307/1494114 |jstor=1494114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A special kind of preservation that takes place in the Netherlands is the preservation of maritime heritage. Maritime trade was the Dutch specialty which shaped much of their culture and as a country that is 50% under sea level the Dutch history is closely intertwined with water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4020-4200-3_24|title=Flood Risk Management in Europe|first1=L.M.|last1=Bouwer|first2=P.|last2=Vellinga|date=20 October 2018|publisher=Springer Netherlands|pages=469–484|doi=10.1007/978-1-4020-4200-3_24}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are maritime museums in both Amsterdam and Rotterdam that tell the story of the Dutch maritime heritage, but there is not much legal documentation on how to preserve it. For example, according to Sarah Dromgoole, &lt;ref&gt;https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/law/people/sarah.dromgoole&lt;/ref&gt; shipwrecks from [[Dutch East India Company|The Dutch East India Company]] are found all around the world, which are still property of the Netherlands, but the Dutch government rarely takes responsibility for this property that is found outside of their territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=nuSwCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA169&amp;lpg=PA169&amp;dq=monumentenwet+1961&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=E4JlsRABjN&amp;sig=wZoBBeGGK6nlqU1VABsCB6PPbfY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjrruD1h67XAhWEl5QKHZP_CjsQ6AEITTAG#v=onepage&amp;q=monumentenwet%201961&amp;f=false|title=The Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage: National Perspectives in Light of the UNESCO Convention 2001 - Second Edition|last=Dromgoole|first=Sarah|date=2006-06-30|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789047410454|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Macedonia ===
In Macedonia, historic preservation falls under the overarching category of cultural heritage preservation according to the Law on Protection of Cultural Heritage (Закон за заштита на културното наследство). According to this law, which the Macedonian Parliament approved in March 2004, there are three types of cultural heritage: immovable, movable, and intangible. Historical preservation is represented by the protection of monuments and monumental entireties under immovable cultural heritage, and historical items under movable cultural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uzkn.gov.mk/dokumenti/Law%20on%20Cultural%20Heritage.pdf “Закон за заштита на културното наследство” (PDF)]. „Сл. Весник на Република Македонија“ бр.20/04. (in Macedonian). Retrieved 2017-11-08&lt;/ref&gt;

Although this Law was the first nation-wide establishment of regulations for historic preservation since the Republic of Macedonia gained independence from Yugoslavia on September 8, 1991, several organizations throughout the 20th century have encompassed efforts of historic preservation.

The “Central office for protection of cultural monuments and natural rarities of the Socialist Republic of Macedonia” has existed since 1949. In 1960, the Central Office was renamed to “National office for protection of cultural monuments”, and granted the status of an independent cultural institution, with authority to execute activities of historic preservation. After the establishment of the Law on Protection of Cultural Heritage in 2004, the Ministry of Culture once again renamed the office to “National center for conservation” and narrowed down its responsibilities to dealing solely with preservation of immovable cultural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;Jovcevska, Biljana.

Other organizations which have contributed to the efforts of historic preservation are the Macedonian National Committee of ICOMOS and the NI Institute for Protection of Monuments of Culture and Museum-Ohrid.

The [[International Council on Monuments and Sites|International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS)]] established their branch in Macedonia in 1995 through the initiative of 43 conservationists from Macedonia. The guiding principles of the Macedonian National Committee of ICOMOS are raising the national consciousness about the importance of historic and cultural heritage, decentralization of the discourse about heritage, and effective monitoring of the status of cultural and historic heritage in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icomos.org.mk/AboutUs.aspx “ICOMOS Macedonia About Us”]. icomos.org.mk (in Macedonian). Retrieved 2017-11-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

The NI Institute for Protection of Monuments of Culture and Museum - Ohrid is the second oldest institutions for historical preservation established in 1952. In 1956 the Institute was granted authority to protect movable and immovable cultural and historic heritage in the Ohrid region. The Institute has since executed numerous efforts for historic preservation, most notably aiding the recognition of the city of Ohrid as a UNESCO site of cultural heritage in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;[http://muzejohrid.mk/istorija “Историја”].

Today, the main authority for historic preservation is the Cultural Heritage Protection Office (Управа за заштита на културно наследство). The Office is an independent governmental organization under the Ministry of Culture, divided into three departments:
#Identification, Protection and Use of Cultural Heritage
#Prevention and Supervision
#Documentation, International Cooperation and Administrative Affairs&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0018/001881/188172eo.pdf "Cultural Heritage in South-East Europe: Macedonia (Former Yugoslav Republic of)" (PDF)].

=== Israel ===
In Israel, there are currently two laws concerning historic preservation, [[Antiquities Law of the State of Israel of 1978|Antiquities Law of the State of Israel]] (1978)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://main.knesset.gov.il/Activity/Legislation/Laws/Pages/LawPrimary.aspx?t=lawlaws&amp;st=lawlaws&amp;lawitemid=2000490|title=חוק מדינת ישראל|website=main.knesset.gov.il}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Planning and Building Law (1965).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mfa.gov.il/MFA/PressRoom/1998/Pages/Planning%20and%20Building%20Law-%201965.aspx|title=Summay of the law in English|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both laws were adapted from the British law that was implemented during the [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|British Mandate of Palestine]].

However, these laws are not comprehensive and limited in scope: the Antiquities Law only applies itself to buildings or artifacts dated before 1700 BC. So while efforts discovering and protecting anything older than 1700 BC are well protected, anything from later historical periods is not under the protection of this law. The Planning and Building Law discusses the overall management and regulation of land use in Israel. It has been through several changes and amendments specifically regarding preservation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://main.knesset.gov.il/Activity/Legislation/Laws/Pages/LawPrimary.aspx?t=lawlaws&amp;st=lawlaws&amp;lawitemid=2000613|title=חוק מדינת ישראל|website=main.knesset.gov.il}}&lt;/ref&gt; but over the years it hasn't been enforced and many historical sites were destroyed, as the state was prioritizing developmental and economic interests.

During the 1960s, the issue of preservation was gaining public awareness, and as a response to the destruction of [[Herzliya Hebrew Gymnasium]] (one of the first educational institutions in Israel) in 1959, a wave of shock and anger led to extensive public debate.&lt;ref&gt;[[Yossi Klein Halevi|Klein Halevi, Yossi]] (2011). [http://www.kotar.co.il/KotarApp/Viewer.aspx?nBookID=96782691#6.2693.6.default האמרקניזציה של תל אביב].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, The Council for Conservation of Heritage Sites in Israel was established, at the recommendation of the Knesset and the Committee of Education. Its aims include locating remains of historic settlements, protect and conserve them as well as developing conservation principles that are specific to Israel’s historic situations and are aligned with international standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eng.shimur.org/viewStaticPage.aspx?pageID=258|title=From the Council for Conservation of Heritage Sites|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The council used to operate under the [[Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel]] but in 2008 registers as an independent non-profit. Today, it is the organization responsible for the most historical preservation endeavors as well as efforts to add amendments to existing laws to provide a comprehensive and effective framework for preservation in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shimur.org/viewArticle.aspx?articleID=165|title=From the Council for Conservation of Heritage Sites: Historical context on the Council's work and outline of future plans [Hebrew&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A different, separate effort in preservation comes from the [[Israeli Defense Force]] (IDF). The IDF surveyed 94 military bases and found that about 80 of them include sites worth preserving, and for each of these bases there is a preservation plan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mod.gov.il/building/engineering/Pages/preservation.aspx The Ministry of Defense statement regarding preservation within IDF bases [Hebrew&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]
&lt;/ref&gt; The IDF is working towards maintaining these building as well as communicating their value to the soldiers in these bases. Buildings include [[Knights Templar]] sites, old military bases used by the British or German or buildings from the Ottoman period.

A historic district in the [[United States]] is a group of buildings, properties, or sites that have been designated by one of several entities on different levels as historically or architecturally significant. Buildings, structures, objects and sites within a historic district are normally divided into two categories, [[Contributing property|contributing]] and non-contributing. Districts greatly vary in size, some having hundreds of structures while others have just a few.

The [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]] designates historic districts through the [[U.S. Department of Interior]], under the auspices of the [[National Park Service]]. Federally designated historic districts are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.&lt;ref name="nps"&gt;[http://www.cr.nps.gov/hps/workingonthepast/toolbox1.htm Federal, State and Local Historic Districts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061015030933/http://www.cr.nps.gov/hps/workingonthepast/toolbox1.htm |date=2006-10-15 }}, TOOLBOX, FAQ, National Park Service.

These include "Main Street" programs that can be used to redevelop rural downtowns.

==National Parks==
{{main|National Park}}

In 1835, the English poet [[William Wordsworth]] described the [[Lake District]] as a "sort of national property, in which every man has a right and interest who has an eye to perceive and a heart to enjoy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wordsworth|first=William|authorlink=William Wordsworth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=idlAAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Guide+through+the+District+of+the+Lakes%E2%80%99&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=sort%20of%20national%20property%20in%20which%20every%20man%20has%20a%20right%20and%20interest%20who%20has%20an%20eye%20to%20perceive%20and%20a%20heart%20to%20enjoy&amp;f=false|title=A guide through the district of the lakes in the north of England with a description of the scenery, &amp;c. for the use of tourists and residents|edition=5th|location=Kendal, England|publisher=Hudson and Nicholson|year=1835|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was, however, the United States that led the world in the creation of [[United States National Park|National Parks]], areas of unspoiled natural wilderness, where the intrusion of civilization are intentionally minimal.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}

The department of the interior designated several areas of [[Morristown, New Jersey]] as the first historic park in the United States national park system. It became designated as the [[Morristown National Historical Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/morr/ |title=Morristown National Historical Park - Morristown National Historical Park |publisher=Nps.gov |date=2012-10-12 |accessdate=2012-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The community had permanent settlements that date to 1715, is termed the military capital of the American Revolution, and contains many designations of sites and locations. The park includes three major sites in Morristown.

In the United Kingdom, [[James Bryce, 1st Viscount Bryce|James Bryce]] the [[ambassador]] to the US praised the system of National Parks and campaigned to have them introduced in Great Britain. Little came of it until mounting public pressure during the early 20th century from the [[Ramblers' Association]] and other groups led to the [[National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949]].

== UNESCO ==
According to UNESCO’s 1972 World Heritage Convention, landscapes and sites of outstanding universal value can be designated as [[World Heritage Site]]s. The World Heritage Convention encompasses historic preservation under the category of “cultural heritage”. According to Article 1 of the Convention, monuments, groups of buildings, and sites “which are of outstanding universal value from the point of view of history, art or science” are to be designated cultural heritage.

A requirement of such designation is that the designating nation has appropriate legal, scientific, technical, administrative and financial measures in place to identify, protect, conserve, present, and rehabilitate world heritage sites. However, according to Article 6 of the Convention, while sovereignty of the State where the site is located is not to be compromised, the State acknowledges that protection of heritage sites is a duty of the entire international community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/conventiontext/|title=Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Heritage convention’s counterpart, The World Heritage Committee,&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/committee/ The World Heritage Committee]
&lt;/ref&gt; is the body responsible for the practical implementation of the Convention as well as managing and deciding how to use the World Heritage Fund. The Committee also gets to have the final say when determining whether a property will be included in the World Heritage List.

The Committee meets once a year and includes representatives from 21 states that are part of the States Parties. Yearly reports are available to the public on the World Heritage website and include outlines of decisions made, outcomes, working documents and various reports.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/decisions/ All available reports of the Committee]

== Potential challenges ==
Although preservation efforts can have benefits for the owners of historical buildings, such as tax cuts and subsidies, there are also drawbacks.

One such drawback is that after a neighborhood has been designated to be historically preserved, there is less construction. On the long term this can affect the value of property and investment in housing, both in the neighborhood itself and the neighborhoods directly surrounding it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nber.org.ccl.idm.oclc.org/papers/w20446.pdf)%20(http://readings.sipx.com/in-efa1d268-3446-11e4-b0d4-22000a890e29/c-a5bb0b99-34dc-11e7-8e82-22000b61898b/x-18c7cf2c-4b0a-11e7-8e82-22000b61898b.pdf?Expires=1510044499&amp;Signature=OYOvpPRjsvsdxGk8mFJuuvpqTmeZ2aWRa5PyPPJ3HEyNSDr36kObybQETDowEcAnOP10WnB82VVejixBL~YiqGuKe6ZJ-fFchJ2tcVcrt4A7QNKhALWi1jE0z2XkqC8tZxb6picEAwMJ3MhUCtEHoA8-kajtxQQaA9QgAjfzX~4_&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIVBE35QX7A7QYJEA|title=Preserving History or Hindering Growth?

A second concern that has been raised is that buildings that need to be historically preserved are sometimes still inhabited. In some cases their inability to make changes to the building can lead to dangerous or unhealthy situations for residents.&lt;ref&gt;Li, C. (2012).

It is not true that nothing could be changed or renovated, but the owner of the building would need to ask permission at the appropriate preservation society, slowing the process down severely. The exact policies are country dependent.&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, J. (2016). Getting Away From “No”: Straight Talk to Local Advocates. ''Forum Journal'' 30(2), 46-49.

==Careers==
Although volunteers continue to play a large role in historic preservation activities, the field has seen an increased level of professionalization. Today, there are many career options in historic preservation in the public, non-profit and private sectors. Institutes of secondary education (universities, colleges, etc.) in the United States offer both certificate and degree ([[Associate in Applied Science|A.A.S]], [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]], [[Bachelor of Fine Arts|B.F.A.]], [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]], [[Master of Arts|M.A.]], [[Master of Fine Arts|M.F.A.]], [[Masters of Design Studies|M.D.S]], [[Master of Historic Preservation|M.H.P.]], [[Master of Science|M.S.]], and [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]]) programs in historic preservation. Some pupils—at schools with such programmes available—choose to enroll in "joint degree" programs, earning a degree in historic preservation along with one in another, related subject, often an [[Master of Architecture|MArch]], [[Master of Urban Planning|MUP]] or [[Juris Doctor|JD]] degree.

Possible career fields include:
;Architectural conservator: Focus specifically on the physical conservation of building materials.
;Architectural historian/historian: Primarily researches and writes statements expressing the historical significance of sites.
;Historic preservation planner: Most are employed by local, county, state or federal government planning agencies to administer tax abatement programs, ensure compliance with local ordinances and state and Federal legislation, and conduct design reviews to ensure that proposed projects will not harm historic and archaeological resources. At the state level, they are known as a [[State Historic Preservation Officer]] while at other levels of government they may be known as a Federal or Tribal Historic Preservation Officer. Some may also serve as consultants to local governments, conducting [[Town and Country Planning Act 1990|Section 106]] reviews in accordance with the [[National Historic Preservation Act of 1966]].
;Preservation architect: Design and develop architectural conservation plans and work specifications in consultation with Engineers, Historians and Planners, ensuring compliance with local design guidelines to protect sensitive historic building fabric. Most are employed by private architecture firms though some find work with government agencies.
;Preservation craftsperson/[[Traditional trades|traditional trades practitioner]]: Employs knowledge of traditional building techniques and contemporary conservation technologies to complete the conservation, repair or restoration of historic buildings.

'''''In Search of...''''' is an American television series that was broadcast weekly from 1977 to 1982, devoted to mysterious phenomena. It was created after the success of three one-hour TV documentaries produced by creator [[Alan Landsburg]]: ''In Search of Ancient Astronauts'' in 1973 (based on the book ''[[Chariots of the Gods?]]'' by [[Erich von Däniken]]), ''In Search of Ancient Mysteries'' and ''[[The Outer Space Connection]]'', both in 1975 (later adapted into popular paperbacks written by Landsburg). All three featured narration by [[Rod Serling]], who was the initial choice to host the spin-off show. Serling died before production started, with [[Leonard Nimoy]] then selected to be the host.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3334003/r-p-leonard-nimoy-passes-away-age-83/|title=R.I.P. Leonard Nimoy Passes Away At Age 83|website=bloody-disgusting.com|accessdate=June 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series was revived with host [[Mitch Pileggi]] in 2002 and again in 2018 with [[Zachary Quinto]], currently airing on the [[History Channel]].

== Format ==
The program conducted investigations into the controversial and [[paranormal]] (e.g., [[unidentified flying object|UFO]]s, [[Bigfoot]], and the [[Loch Ness Monster]]). Additionally, it featured episodes about mysterious historical events and personalities such as [[Anna Anderson]]/[[Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia|Grand Duchess Anastasia]], the [[Abraham Lincoln#Assassination|Lincoln Assassination]], the [[Jack the Ripper]] murders, infamous cults (e.g., [[Jim Jones]]), and missing persons, cities, and ships (e.g., [[Amelia Earhart]], [[Jimmy Hoffa]], [[D. B. Cooper]], the ''[[Mary Celeste]]'', the ''[[RMS Titanic|Titanic]]'', the lost [[Roanoke Colony]]). Because the show often presented offbeat subjects and controversial theories, each episode's opening credits included a verbal disclaimer about the conjectural nature of the evidence and theories to be presented:

{{cquote|This series presents information based in part on theory and conjecture. The producer's purpose is to suggest some possible explanations, but not necessarily the only ones, to the mysteries we will examine.}}

The production values were fairly typical of the period, with interviews, reenactments and scenic footage shot on film, all voiced over by Nimoy. The music was composed by Laurin M. Rinder and W. Michael Lewis. A soundtrack album was released on AVI (American Variety International) Records in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;Release catalog number AVL 6008 by American Variety International Records Distributing Corp. 9220 Sunset Blvd., Los Angeles, California 90069.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nimoy's popularity among [[science fiction]] fans (due to his role as [[Spock]] in the original ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' television series) won the show a following in [[fandom]] circles. Nimoy wrote an episode about the turbulent life of artist [[Vincent van Gogh]], having earlier played the artist's brother Theo in a one-man show. As part of his research, Nimoy found records in the archives of the hospital where Van Gogh was treated that suggested that he suffered from [[epilepsy]] rather than insanity.

The show also spawned at least six spin-off books, all written by Landsburg with forewords by Nimoy: ''In Search of Lost Civilizations,'' ''In Search of Extraterrestrials,'' ''In Search of Magic and Witchcraft,'' ''In Search of Strange Phenomena,'' ''In Search of Missing Persons,'' and ''In Search of Myths and Monsters,'' with an additional book that collected the best segments from these existing volumes.

In 1978, Landsburg produced a Bigfoot documentary using portions of two ''In Search of...'' episodes ("The Monster Hunters" and "The Yeti") called ''Manbeast! Myth or Monster,'' based on his book ''In Search of Myths and Monsters.'' Though Nimoy had written the foreword to Landsburg's book, he did not narrate this documentary.

Reruns of the ''In Search of...'' series aired during the early 1990s on the [[A&amp;E (TV channel)|A&amp;E Network]]. In the later 1990s, the show aired on another of the [[A&amp;E Television Networks]]' properties, the [[History (U.S. TV network)|History Channel]]. The licensing agreement expired in the early 2000s, ending the show's run. When the show aired on A&amp;E, a re-recording of the original theme music was used plus a new alternate theme. The original opening titles were also modernized. In this incarnation virtually all of Nimoy's on-camera appearances in the series were replaced with reused footage, so viewers could hear Nimoy but not see him.

A short-lived revival of the show, featuring [[Mitch Pileggi]], aired on the [[Syfy|Sci-Fi Channel]] in 2002.

In January 2018, it was announced that [[Zachary Quinto]], who, like Nimoy, stars as [[Spock]] in the rebooted [[Star Trek (film series)#Reboot (Kelvin Timeline) films|''Star Trek'' films]], will host the revived version of the show on History Channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.realityblurred.com/realitytv/2018/01/history-in-search-of-zachary-quinto/|title=Zachary Quinto investigates the paranormal on History’s revival of In Search Of – reality blurred|date=January 30, 2018|publisher=|accessdate=June 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The International Summer University''' is a short-term program that is held during the summer season by the [[University of Kassel]] every year. In addition to the international master programs,&lt;ref&gt;See the list of [http://cms.uni-kassel.de/unicms/index.php?id=study International Study Programmes] for details.&lt;/ref&gt; University Kassel organizes the ISU as one of its internationalization strategies.

The program of the ISU is designed for university students as well as researchers and professionals who want to learn more about [[Germans|German]] and European perspectives in [[Environmental Sciences]] and German Language &amp; Culture. Environmental science has been one of the strengths of Uni Kassel since its foundation in 1971. During the winter season the University Kassel offers the [[International Winter University (IWU) Kassel]]. The theme “sustainability” does not only cover the academic content of the ISU/IWU, but also the program design which encourages continuous learning within and outside classrooms.

==History and development of the programme==
The International Summer University started as one of the Hessen International Summer Universities that have been designed to attract international students to [[Hessen]].&lt;ref&gt;See the [http://www.isu-hessen.de Hessen International Summer Universities (ISU) homepage] for reference.&lt;/ref&gt; Established in 2001, ISU offers short-term credit-bearing academic program featuring the strengths of University Kassel in the areas of Environmental Sciences and German Language &amp; Culture studies. Apart from the academic components with specific foci, ISU is unique in its host-family program for students to experience first-hand German lifestyle. The University’s long-standing partnerships with industries in the region and experiences in university-industry [[knowledge transfer]] also bring additional benefit to ISU students by giving them opportunities to witness the application of academic knowledge in industrial settings.

Since its inception, ISU has brought some 50 international students to Kassel every year. Some of these students returned to Kassel for further studies and many of them have become the ambassadors of the University and the city of Kassel in their home countries.

The uniqueness of ISU lies in the concern for the [[sustainability]] of global environment and [[cultural heritage]]. While ISU Kassel embraces [[globalization]] and [[innovation]] in the study program, the best practices of the program have been kept – arrangement of host families – to ensure that the visiting students are fully engaged in the [[local community]] and culture during their short stay in [[Kassel]]. Students are arranged to live with carefully selected host families and to practice their classroom knowledge with tandem partners and tutors. Workshops (e.g. German dancing, cooking, sports), field trips and excursions in Kassel and neighboring areas are also organized to introduce local culture and traditions to the students. Since the program is held during the term time, ISU students also have abundant opportunities to meet local students and participate in student activities on campus.



==Program of study==
The study program of ISU includes German language courses which are designed to meet the criteria of the [[Common European Framework of Reference for Languages]] (European Language Portfolio) at the following levels: A1, B1 and C1. Students will study in small groups under the supervision of experienced teachers qualified in "'teaching German as a foreign language"'. Interactive and innovative teaching methods are characteristics of this German language course.

The seminars for the engineering module usually cover the following topics: [[adaptation to global warming|adaptation strategies to climate change]], [[earthquake engineering]], [[environmental engineering]], and integrated environmental science [[environmental science]]. Seminars for the German culture module usually covers topics such as [[history of germany]], German politics of the 20th century, [[intercultural communication]], and [[Grimm's Fairy Tales|German fairy tales]]. Students proficient in German language may choose the German-taught seminar of "Deutsche Geschichte und Politik im 20. Jahrhundert".

Students will be awarded 9 [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS]] upon completion of the German language course and two academic seminars in either the engineering module or culture module. The seminars are taught by experienced faculty members in English and optionally in German. Students of the engineering module are arranged to visit industrial partners. Students from the cultural module are arranged to visit the museums and cultural establishments in Kassel.&lt;ref&gt;See a list of [http://www.kassel.de/englisch/culture/museums/ museums] in Kassel.&lt;/ref&gt;

==About Kassel and Uni Kassel==


[[Kassel]] is a mid-sized city located in northern Hessen in the center of Germany. The city has around 198,500 inhabitants and a total area of 107 km2. Kassel is known as the "Capital of the [[German Fairy Tale Route]]" for it is the place where [[Jacob Grimm]] and [[Wilhelm Grimm]] spent more than 30 years of their lives to collect and compile the [[Grimm's Fairy Tales]] (German: ''Grimms Märchen'') collection. Kassel is also the city of "[[documenta]]" where the world’s largest exhibition of contemporary art takes place every five years.

In 1971, Uni Kassel was founded in the city of Kassel as a reform university. The University is one of the first universities to have developed an international and inter-disciplinary perspective in research and learning. Being the youngest public university in the state of Hessen, it has currently a student population of over 25,000, which includes some 3,200 international students from over 120 countries.&lt;ref&gt;See the University of Kassel's [https://www.uni-kassel.de/uni/en/international-service/coming-to-kassel/facts-and-figures/ "Facts and figures"] page.&lt;/ref&gt;

(This article lists some of the '''states''', '''empires''', or '''dynasties''' that were ruled by a Muslim elite, or which were in some way central to or a part of a Muslim empire.)   

All the disparate Islamic Empires can all be traced back to Muhammad, as the founder not only of the Islamic faith but also the first leader of the Muslim people.   

Scholars debate what exactly constitutes an [[empire]]. One definition defines an empire as a [[Sovereign state|state]] that extends [[dominion]] over areas and populations [[culturally]] and [[ethnically]] distinct  from the culture/ethnicity at the center of power.  

== History of Muslim states==
The [[early Muslim conquests]] began in the lifetime of [[Muhammad]]. His successors conquered large swaths of the Middle East and North Africa, in addition to parts of [[southern Europe]] and the [[Indian subcontinent]], in the decades after his death.  The [[caliphate]] founded by his earliest successors, called the [[Rashidun caliphate]], was succeeded by the [[Umayyad caliphate]] and later the [[Abbasid caliphate]].

While the caliphates gradually fractured and fell, other Muslim dynasties rose; some of these dynasties grew into "Islamic empires", with some of the most notable being the Safavid, Ottoman, and Mughal Empires.

== Caliphates ==
[[Image:Age-of-caliphs.png|right|240px|thumb|Umayyad Empire at its greatest extent]]

Their significance is in the areas of [[Iranian languages|linguistics]], [[history of Iran|history]], and study of [[religion in Persia]]. Some of the inscriptions are lost and are known only through tradition.

Early royal Sasanian inscriptions were trilingual: [[Middle Persian language|Middle Persian]] (in [[Inscriptional Pahlavi]]), [[Parthian language|Parthian]] (in [[Inscriptional Parthian]]) and [[Koine Greek|Greek]]. Since the rule of [[Narseh]], Greek was omitted. [[Book Pahlavi]] script replaced Inscriptional Pahlavi in late Middle Persian inscriptions.

As the German army retreated during the later stages of the [[World War II|Second World War]], many of the urban areas of what is now Poland were severely damaged as a result of military action between the retreating forces of the [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[Wehrmacht]] and advancing ones of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Red Army]]. Other cities were deliberately destroyed by the German forces.  One of the most famous of these planned destructions was the razing of [[Warsaw]], the [[capital city|capital]] of Poland.&lt;ref name="anthonymtung"&gt;{{cite book | last = Anthony M. Tung| title = Preserving the world's great cities:The Destruction and Renewal of the Historic Metropolis|edition= 2001| publisher = [[Three Rivers Press]]| isbn= 0-517-70148-0|url=http://www.anthonymtung.com/excerpts.htm#Chap4}}&lt;/ref&gt; While extensively damaged by the failed [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]] and [[Warsaw Uprising]], the city later underwent a [[Destruction of Warsaw|planned demolition]] by German forces under order from [[Adolf Hitler]] and high officials within the Nazi government. On 17 October 1944, [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] chief [[Heinrich Himmler]] famously stated, "The city must completely disappear from the surface of the earth and serve only as a transport station for the Wehrmacht."&lt;ref name= "Wituska, Tomaszewski p. xxii"&gt;[[#refWituskaTomaszewski2006|Wituska, Tomaszewski 2006]], p. xxii.&lt;/ref&gt;  Before they were stopped by the advancing Red Army, 85% of the city had been taken out.&lt;ref name= "Free Europe Committee p. 10"/&gt;  Warsaw was far from the worst off after the Nazi retreat; 97% of [[Jasło]]&lt;ref name="austriantimes"&gt;{{cite web |date= July 7, 2009|url = http://www.austriantimes.at/news/Panorama/2009-07-07/14509/Polish_town_at_odds_over_Hitler%92s_oak|title = Polish town at odds over Hitler's oak|format = |publisher = Austrian Times| accessdate = October 8, 2009 | last=Lisa Chapman |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 100% of [[Polanów]] were reduced to rubble.&lt;ref name="PL"/&gt;  Other towns such as [[Wałcz]] fared better, with only a quarter of the city being destroyed.&lt;ref name="PL"/&gt;  Ancient historical buildings in Polish cities were not spared; for example, [[Trzemeszno]]'s [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] [[basilica]] of 1130-45 was burnt down in 1945.&lt;ref name="PL"/&gt;

[[File:Apollo 11 Crew During Training Exercise - GPN-2002-000032.jpg|thumb|[[Astronaut]]s [[Buzz Aldrin]] and [[Neil Armstrong]] in NASA's training [[mockup]] of the Moon and lander module. Conspiracy theorists say that the films of the missions were made using sets similar to this training mockup.]]

'''Moon landing conspiracy theories''' claim that some or all elements of the [[Apollo program]] and the associated [[Moon landing]]s were [[hoax]]es staged by [[NASA]], possibly with the aid of other organizations. The most notable claim is that the [[List of Apollo missions#Manned Apollo missions|six manned landings (1969–72)]] were faked and that [[List of Apollo astronauts#Apollo astronauts who walked on the Moon|12 Apollo astronauts]] did not actually walk on the [[Moon]]. Various groups and individuals have made claims since the mid-1970s that NASA and others knowingly misled the public into believing the landings happened, by manufacturing, tampering with, or destroying evidence including photos, [[telemetry]] tapes, radio and TV transmissions, [[Moon rock]] samples, and even killing some key witnesses.

Much [[third-party evidence for Apollo Moon landings|third-party evidence for the landings]] exists, and detailed rebuttals to the hoax claims have been made.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Plait|Plait 2002]], pp. 154–173&lt;/ref&gt; Since the late 2000s, high-definition photos taken by the [[Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter]] (LRO) of the Apollo landing sites have captured the lander modules and the tracks left by the astronauts.&lt;ref name="NASA LRO"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/LRO/news/apollo-sites.html |title=NASA Spacecraft Images Offer Sharper Views of Apollo Landing Sites |last1=Neal-Jones |first1=Nancy |last2=Zubritsky |first2=Elizabeth |last3=Cole |first3=Steve |editor-last=Garner |editor-first=Robert |date=September 6, 2011 |publisher=NASA |id=Goddard Release No. 11-058 (co-issued as NASA HQ Release No. 11-289) |accessdate=September 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lroc.sese.asu.edu/news/index.php?/archives/620-Question-Answered!.html |title=LRO slewed 19° down-Sun allowing the illuminated side of the still standing American flag to be captured at the Apollo 17 landing site.

[[Conspiracy theory|Conspiracists]] have managed to sustain public interest in their theories for more than 40 years, despite the rebuttals and third-party evidence. Opinion polls taken in various locations have shown that between 6% and 20% of Americans, 25% of Britons, and 28% of Russians surveyed believe that the manned landings were faked. Even as late as 2001, the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox television network]] documentary ''Conspiracy Theory: Did We Land on the Moon?'' claimed NASA faked the first landing in 1969 to win the [[Space Race]].&lt;ref name="greatmoonhoax"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2001/ast23feb_2/ |title=The Great Moon Hoax |last=Phillips |first=Tony |date=February 23, 2001 |work=Science@NASA |publisher=[[NASA]] |accessdate=July 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
An early and influential book about the subject of a moon-landing conspiracy, ''We Never Went to the Moon: America's Thirty Billion Dollar Swindle'', was [[Self-publishing|self-published]] in 1976 by [[Bill Kaysing]], a former [[U.S. Navy|US Navy]] officer with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in English.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kaysing|Kaysing 2002]]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite having no knowledge of rockets or technical writing,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kaysing|Kaysing 2002]], p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Kaysing was hired as a senior [[technical writer]] in 1956 by [[Rocketdyne]], the company that built the [[F-1 (rocket engine)|F-1]] engines used on the [[Saturn V]] rocket.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kaysing|Kaysing 2002]], p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://billkaysing.com/biography.php |title=A brief biography of Bill Kaysing |last=Kaysing |first=Wendy L. |publisher=BillKaysing.com |accessdate=February 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served as head of the technical publications unit at the company's Propulsion Field Laboratory until 1963. Kaysing's book made many allegations, and effectively began discussion of the Moon landings being faked.&lt;ref name=k-pg7 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Plait|Plait 2002]], p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; The book claims that the chance of a successful manned landing on the Moon was calculated to be 0.0017%, and that despite close monitoring by the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], it would have been easier for NASA to fake the Moon landings than to really go there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://braeunig.us/space/hoax.htm |title=Did we land on the Moon? |last=Braeunig |first=Robert A. |date=November 2006 |website=Rocket and Space Technology |publisher=Robert Braeunig |accessdate=May 3, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522183404/http://www.braeunig.us/space/hoax.htm |archivedate=May 22, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billkaysing.com/hoaxtheory.php |last=Galuppini |first=Albino |title=Hoax Theory |publisher=BillKaysing.com |accessdate=May 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, the [[Flat Earth Society]] accused NASA of faking the landings, arguing that they were staged by Hollywood with [[Walt Disney]] sponsorship, based on a script by [[Arthur C. Clarke]] and directed by [[Stanley Kubrick]].&lt;ref group=Note&gt;In 1968, Clarke and Kubrick had collaborated on the film ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', which realistically portrayed a Moon mission.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schadewald |first=Robert J. |authorlink=Robert Schadewald |date=July 1980 |title=The Flat-out Truth: Earth Orbits?

She notes that this happened during the post-[[Watergate scandal|Watergate]] era, when American citizens were [[Credibility gap|inclined to distrust official accounts]].

== Conspiracists and their contentions ==
After Kaysing, Moon-landing conspiracists include (in alphabetical order):
* [[Marcus Allen (publisher)|Marcus Allen]] – British publisher of ''[[Nexus (magazine)|Nexus]]'', who said photographs of the lander would not prove that the United States put men on the Moon, and "Getting to the Moon really isn't much of a problem – [[Luna 2|the Russians did that in 1959]]. The big problem is getting people there." He suggests that NASA sent robot missions because [[radiation]] levels in [[outer space]] would be deadly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=World's biggest telescope to prove Americans really walked on Moon |first=Robert |last=Matthews |authorlink=Robert Matthews (scientist) |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/1414144/Worlds-biggest-telescope-to-prove-Americans-really-walked-on-Moon.html |date=November 24, 2002 |newspaper=[[The Sunday Telegraph]] |publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]] |location=London |accessdate=May 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A variant of this idea has it that NASA and its contractors did not recover quickly enough from the [[Apollo 1]] fire, and so all the early Apollo missions were faked, with [[Apollo 14|Apollos 14]] or [[Apollo 15|15]] being the first real mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cosmoquest.org/forum/archive/index.php/t-1180.html |title=Irrefutable proof [Archive&amp;#93; – Bad Astronomy and Universe Today Forum |date=May 3, 2002 |publisher=[[Bad Astronomy]] |type=Forum |accessdate=November 25, 2008}}{{Unreliable source?|date=August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Claimed motives of the United States and NASA ==
Those who believe the Moon landings were faked give several theories about the motives of NASA and the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]]. The three main theories are below.

=== The Space Race ===
Motivation for the United States to engage the [[Soviet Union]] in a [[Space Race]] can be traced to the then on-going [[Cold War]]. Landing on the Moon was viewed as a national and technological accomplishment that would generate world-wide acclaim. But going to the Moon would be risky and expensive, as exemplified by [[President of the United States|President]] [[John F. Kennedy#Space program|John F. Kennedy]] famously stating in [[We choose to go to the Moon|a 1962 speech]] that the [[United States]] chose to go ''because'' it was hard.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Chaikin|Chaikin 2007]], p. 2, "We choose to go to the Moon! We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things – not because they are easy, but because they are ''hard.''" – Kennedy speaking at [[Rice University]], September 12, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoax theory-debunker [[Philip Plait]] says in his book ''[[Bad Astronomy]]'', that the Soviets – with [[Soviet manned lunar programs|their own competing Moon program]], an [[nuclear espionage|extensive intelligence network]] and a formidable scientific community able to analyze NASA data – would have cried foul if the United States tried to fake a Moon landing,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Plait|Plait 2002]], p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; especially since their own program had failed. Proving a hoax would have been a huge propaganda win for the Soviets. Conspiracist [[Bart Sibrel]] responded, "the Soviets did not have the capability to track deep space craft until late in 1972, immediately after which, the last three Apollo missions were abruptly canceled."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moonmovie.com/faq.htm |title=Moon Hoax MOONMOVIE.COM Frequently Asked Questions |work=Moonmovie.com |publisher=AFTH, LLC |location=Nashville, TN |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212134517/http://www.moonmovie.com/faq.htm |archivedate=February 12, 2008 |accessdate=August 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, the Soviets had been sending [[unmanned spacecraft]] to the Moon since 1959,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://airandspace.si.edu/exhibitions/gal114/SpaceRace/sec300/sec361.htm |title=Soviet Lunar Programs |website=Space Race |publisher=[[National Air and Space Museum]] |location=Washington, D.C. |type=Online version of exhibition on view in Gallery 114 |accessdate=November 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "during 1962, deep space tracking facilities were introduced at IP-15 in [[Ussuriysk|Ussuriisk]] and IP-16 in [[Yevpatoria|Evpatoria]] (Crimean Peninsula), while Saturn communication stations were added to IP-3, 4 and 14,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.russianspaceweb.com/kik.html |title=Russia's space command and control infrastructure |last=Zak |first=Anatoly |website=RussianSpaceWeb.com |publisher=Anatoly Zak |accessdate=November 13, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100708063431/http://www.russianspaceweb.com/kik.html |archivedate=July 8, 2010 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; the latter having a 100 million km range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astronautix.com/articles/sovstems.htm |title=Soviet Space Tracking Systems |work=[[Encyclopedia Astronautica]] |publisher=Mark Wade |accessdate=November 13, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101101224934/http://www.astronautix.com/articles/sovstems.htm |archivedate=November 1, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet Union tracked the Apollo missions at the Space Transmissions Corps, which was "fully equipped with the latest intelligence-gathering and surveillance equipment."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Scheaffer|Scheaffer 2004]], p. 247&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vasily Mishin]], in an interview for the article "The Moon Programme That Faltered," describes how the Soviet Moon program dwindled after the Apollo landings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=March 1991 |title=The Moon Programme That Faltered |journal=[[Spaceflight (magazine)|Spaceflight]] |volume=33 |pages=2–3 |location=London |publisher=[[British Interplanetary Society]]|bibcode=1991SpFl...33....2. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, there was nothing "abrupt" about the [[Canceled Apollo missions|Apollo cancelations]], which were announced in January and September 1970 for cost-cutting reasons.&lt;ref name="Cancelled Apollos"&gt;"[http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/lunar/apollo_18_20.html Apollo 18 through 20 – The Canceled Missions]", Dr. David R. Williams, NASA, accessed July 19, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; (See '''Vietnam War''' below.)

=== NASA funding and prestige ===
Conspiracy theorists claim that NASA faked the landings to avoid humiliation and to ensure that it continued to get funding. NASA raised "about US$30 billion" to go to the Moon, and [[Bill Kaysing|Kaysing]] claimed in his book that this could have been used to "pay off" many people.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kaysing|Kaysing 2002]], p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; Since most conspiracists believe that sending men to the Moon was impossible at the time,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Attivissimo|Attivissimo 2013]], p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; they argue that landings had to be faked to fulfill Kennedy's 1961 goal, "before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth."&lt;ref name="Special Message"&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Kennedy, John F. |date=May 25, 1961 |title=Special Message to Congress on Urgent National Needs |medium=Motion picture (excerpt) |url=http://www.jfklibrary.org/Asset-Viewer/xzw1gaeeTES6khED14P1Iw.aspx |accessdate=August 1, 2013 |publisher=John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum |location=Boston, MA |id=Accession Number: TNC:200; Digital Identifier: TNC-200-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, NASA accounted for the cost of Apollo to the US Congress in 1973, totaling US$25.4 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Congress, House of Representatives, Committee on Science and Astronautics |title=1974 NASA Authorization Hearings |type=Hearing on H.R. 4567 |year=1973 |publisher=[[93rd United States Congress|93rd Congress]], first session |location=Washington, D.C. |oclc=23229007 |ref=93rd Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary Bennett and David Percy have claimed in ''Dark Moon: Apollo and the Whistle-Blowers'', that, with all the known and unknown hazards,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bennett &amp; Percy|Bennett &amp; Percy 2001]], p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; NASA would not risk broadcasting an astronaut getting sick or dying on live television.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bennett &amp; Percy|Bennett &amp; Percy 2001]], pp. 330–31&lt;/ref&gt; The counter-argument generally given is that NASA in fact ''did'' incur a great deal of public humiliation and potential political opposition to the program by losing an entire crew in the [[Apollo 1]] fire during a ground test, leading to its upper management team being questioned by Senate and House of Representatives space oversight committees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

=== Vietnam War ===
The American Patriot Friends Network claimed in 2009 that the landings helped the United States government distract public attention from the unpopular [[Role of the United States in the Vietnam War#Americanization|Vietnam War]], and so manned landings suddenly ended about the same time that the United States ended its involvement in the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apfn.org/apfn/moon.htm |title=Was The Apollo Moon Landing Fake? |date=July 21, 2009 |website=American Patriot Friends Network (APFN) |publisher=APFN.org |accessdate=November 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the ending of the landings was not "sudden" (see '''The Space Race''' above). The war was one of several federal budget items with which NASA had to compete; NASA's budget peaked in 1966, and fell by 42.3% by 1972.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Office of Management and Budget&lt;/ref&gt; This was the reason the final flights were cut, along with plans for even more ambitious follow-on programs such as a permanent [[space station]] and manned flight to Mars.&lt;ref&gt;Hepplewhite, T.A. [https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4221/sp4221.htm ''The Space Shuttle Decision: NASA's Search for a Reusable Space Vehicle''], chapter 4. Washington, DC: National Aeronautics and Space Administration, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hoax claims and rebuttals==
Many Moon-landing conspiracy theories have been put forward, claiming either that the landings did not happen and that NASA employees have lied, or that the landings did happen but not in the way that has been told. Conspiracists have focused on perceived gaps or inconsistencies in the historical record of the missions. The foremost idea is that the whole manned landing program was a hoax from start to end. Some claim that the technology to send men to the Moon was lacking or that the [[Van Allen radiation belt]]s, [[solar flare]]s, [[solar wind]], [[coronal mass ejection]]s and [[cosmic ray]]s made such a trip impossible.&lt;ref name=k-pg7&gt;[[#Kaysing|Kaysing 2002]], p. 7–8&lt;/ref&gt;

Vince Calder and Andrew Johnson, scientists from [[Argonne National Laboratory]], have given detailed answers to  conspiracists' claims on the laboratory's website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/askasci/gen01/gen01278.htm |last1=Calder |first1=Vince |last2=Johnson |first2=Andrew, P.E.|last3=ProfHoff 503 |title=Ask A Scientist|date=October 12, 2002|work=Newton |publisher=[[Argonne National Laboratory]] |accessdate=August 14, 2009 |display-authors=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; They show that NASA's portrayal of the Moon landing is fundamentally accurate, allowing for such common mistakes as mislabeled photos and imperfect personal recollections. Using the [[scientific process]], any hypothesis that is contradicted by the observable facts may be rejected. The 'real landing' hypothesis is a single story since it comes from a single source, but there is no unity in the hoax hypothesis because hoax accounts vary between conspiracists.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ramsay|Ramsay 2006]] (page needed)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Number of conspirators involved ===
According to [[James Longuski]] (Professor of Aeronautics and Astronautics Engineering at [[Purdue University]]), the conspiracy theories are impossible because of their size and complexity. The conspiracy would have to involve more than 400,000 people who worked on the Apollo project for nearly ten years, the 12 men who walked on the Moon, the six others who flew with them as [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Command Module]] pilots, and another six astronauts who orbited the Moon.&lt;ref group=Note&gt; This number includes the crews of Apollos 8, [[Apollo 10|10]], and [[Apollo 13|13]], though the latter technically only performed a fly-by. These three missions account for only six additional astronauts because James Lovell orbited the Moon twice (Apollos 8 and 13) and John Young and Gene Cernan orbited on Apollo 10 both later landed on the Moon.&lt;/ref&gt; Hundreds of thousands of people – including astronauts, scientists, engineers, technicians, and skilled laborers – would have had to keep the secret. Longuski argues that it would have been much easier to really land on the Moon than to generate such a huge conspiracy to fake the landings.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Longuski|Longuski 2006]], p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Aaronovitch|Aaronovitch 2010]], pp. 1–2, 6&lt;/ref&gt; To date, nobody from the United States government or NASA linked to the Apollo program has said the Moon landings were hoaxes. [[Penn Jillette]] made note of this in the "Conspiracy Theories" episode of his television show ''[[Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!]]'' in 2005.&lt;ref name="bullshit"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Conspiracy Theories |series=[[Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!]] |network=[[Showtime (TV channel)|Showtime]] |airdate=May 9, 2005 |season=3 |number=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the number of people involved, and noting the [[Watergate scandal]], Jillette noted that ''someone'' would have outed the hoax by now.

=== Photographic and film oddities ===
{{Main|Examination of Apollo Moon photographs}}

Moon-landing conspiracists focus heavily on NASA photos. They point to oddities in photos and films taken on the Moon. Photography experts (including those unrelated to NASA) have replied that the oddities are consistent with what should be expected from a real Moon landing, and are not consistent with tweaked or studio imagery. Some main arguments and counter-arguments are listed below.

1. In some photos, the [[Reticle|crosshairs]] appear to be behind objects. The cameras were fitted with a [[Réseau plate]] (a clear glass plate with a [[reticle]] etched on), making it impossible for any photographed object to appear "in front" of the grid. Conspiracists often use this evidence to suggest that objects were "pasted" over the photographs, and hence obscure the reticle.

:* ''This effect only appears in copied and scanned photos, not any originals. It is caused by overexposure: the bright white areas of the emulsion "bleed" over the thin black crosshairs. The crosshairs are only about 0.004 inches thick (0.1 mm) and emulsion would only have to bleed about half that much to fully obscure it. Furthermore, there are many photos where the middle of the crosshair is "washed-out" but the rest is intact. In some photos of the American flag, parts of one crosshair appear on the red stripes, but parts of the same crosshair are faded or invisible on the white stripes. There would have been no reason to "paste" white stripes onto the flag.&lt;ref name="clavius-crosshairs"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clavius.org/photoret.html |title=Clavius: Photography – Crosshairs |last=Windley |first=Jay |website=Moon Base Clavius |publisher=Clavius.org |accessdate=April 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2. Crosshairs are sometimes rotated or in the wrong place.

:* ''This is a result of popular photos being cropped and/or rotated for aesthetic impact.''&lt;ref name="clavius-crosshairs" /&gt;

3. The quality of the photographs is implausibly high.

4. There are no [[star]]s in any of the photos; the [[Apollo 11]] astronauts also stated in post-mission press conferences that they did not remember seeing any stars during [[Extravehicular activity|EVA]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kaysing|Kaysing 2002]], pp. 20, 21, 22, 23&lt;/ref&gt; Conspiracists contend that [[NASA]] chose not to put the stars into the [[photograph|photo]]s because [[astronomer]]s would have been able to use them to determine whether the photos were taken from the Earth or the [[Moon]], by means of identifying them and comparing their celestial position and [[parallax]] to what would be expected for either observation site.

:* ''The astronauts were talking about naked-eye sightings of stars during the lunar daytime. They regularly sighted stars through the spacecraft navigation optics while aligning their inertial reference platforms, the [[Apollo PGNCS]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/alsj-AOTNavStarsDetents.html |title=Navigation Stars used in the AOT |last1=Jones |first1=Eric M. |date=January 21, 2012 |website=Apollo Lunar Surface Journal |publisher=NASA |accessdate=September 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:* ''Stars are rarely seen in [[Space Shuttle]], [[Mir]], Earth observation photos, or even photos taken at sporting events held at night. The light from the [[Sun]] in outer space in the Earth-Moon system is at least as bright as the [[sunlight]] that reaches the Earth's surface on a clear day at noon, so [[camera]]s used for imaging subjects illuminated by sunlight are set for a [[Sunny 16 rule|daylight exposure]]. The dim light of the stars simply does not provide enough [[Exposure (photography)|exposure]] to record visible images. All manned landings happened during the lunar daytime. Thus, the stars were outshone by the sun and by sunlight reflected off the Moon's surface. The astronauts' eyes were adapted to the sunlit landscape around them so that they could not see the relatively faint stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/blogs/earthmatters/2011/09/28/where-are-the-stars/?src=twitter-em |title=Where are the stars? |last=Carlowicz |first=Mike |date=September 28, 2011 |work=[[NASA Earth Observatory]] |publisher=NASA |type=Blog |accessdate=April 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Plait|Plait 2002]], pp. 158–60&lt;/ref&gt; The astronauts could see stars with the naked eye only when they were in the shadow of the Moon.''&lt;ref&gt;[[#Woods|Woods 2008]], pp. 206–07&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Harrison|Harrison 2012]], pp. 95–96&lt;/ref&gt;

:* ''Camera settings can turn a well-lit background to black when the foreground object is brightly lit, forcing the camera to increase shutter speed so that the foreground light does not wash out the image. A demonstration of this effect is here.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Lamp-and-moon-example-2.JPG]]&lt;/ref&gt; The effect is similar to not being able to see stars from a brightly lit car park at night – the stars only become visible when the lights are turned off. 

:* ''A special far [[ultraviolet]] camera, the [[Far Ultraviolet Camera/Spectrograph]], was taken to the lunar surface on [[Apollo 16]] and operated in the shadow of the [[Apollo Lunar Module]] (LM). It took photos of Earth and of many stars, some of which are dim in visible light but bright in the ultraviolet. These observations were later matched with observations taken by orbiting ultraviolet telescopes. Furthermore, the positions of those stars with respect to Earth are correct for the time and location of the Apollo 16 photos.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Keel |first=William C. |date=July 2007 |title=The Earth and Stars in the Lunar Sky |journal=Skeptical Inquirer |volume=31 |issue=4 |pages=47–50 |location=Amherst, NY |publisher=Committee for Skeptical Inquiry}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astr.ua.edu/keel/space/Apollo16EarthID.gif |title=Apollo16EarthID.gif |last=Keel |first=William C. |website=UA Astronomy Home Page  |format=[[Graphics Interchange Format|GIF]] |accessdate=May 8, 2013}} Base image: AS16-123-19657; Earth image start: 1233 CDT 21 April 1972; Field shown: 18.9 degrees.&lt;/ref&gt;

5. The angle and color of shadows are inconsistent. This suggests that artificial lights were used.

:* ''Shadows on the Moon are complicated by reflected light, uneven ground, [[wide-angle lens]] distortion, and [[lunar dust]]. There are several light sources: the Sun, sunlight reflected from the Earth, sunlight reflected from the Moon's surface, and sunlight reflected from the astronauts and the Lunar Module. Light from these sources is scattered by lunar dust in many directions, including into shadows. Shadows falling into craters and hills may appear longer, shorter and distorted.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Plait|Plait 2002]], pp. 167–72&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, shadows display the properties of [[vanishing point]] perspective, leading them to converge to a point on the horizon.''
:* This theory was further debunked on the ''[[MythBusters]]'' episode "[[MythBusters (2008 season)#Episode 104 – "NASA Moon Landing"|NASA Moon Landing]]".

6. There are identical backgrounds in photos which, according to their captions, were taken miles apart. This suggests that a painted background was used.

:* ''Backgrounds were not identical, just similar. What appear as nearby hills in some photos are actually mountains many miles away. On Earth, objects that are further away will appear fainter and less detailed.

7. The number of photos taken is implausibly high. Up to one photo per 50 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aulis.com/skeleton.htm |title=The skeleton in NASA's spacesuit |last=White |first=Jack |year=2005 |website=AULIS Online |publisher=AULIS Publishing |location=London |accessdate=November 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:* ''Simplified gear with fixed settings allowed two photos a second. Many were taken immediately after each other as stereo pairs or panorama sequences. The calculation (one per 50 seconds) was based on a lone astronaut on the surface, and does not take into account that there were two astronauts sharing the workload and simultaneously taking photographs during an [[Extra-vehicular activity]] (EVA).''

8. The photos contain artifacts like the two seemingly matching 'C's on a rock and on the ground. These may be labeled studio props.

:* ''The "C"-shaped objects are most likely printing imperfections and do not appear in the original film from the camera. It has been suggested that the "C" is a coiled hair.&lt;ref name="whomourns" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clavius.org/rover1.html |title=Clavius: Photo Analysis – lunar rover |last=Windley |first=Jay |website=Moon Base Clavius |publisher=Clavius.org |accessdate=September 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

9. A resident of [[Perth|Perth, Western Australia]], a woman named Una Ronald (a pseudonym created by the authors of the source&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bennett &amp; Percy|Bennett &amp; Percy 2001]], p. 321&lt;/ref&gt;), said that for two or three seconds she saw a [[Coca-Cola]] bottle roll across the lower right quadrant of her television screen that was displaying the live broadcast of the Apollo 11 EVA. She also said that several letters appeared in ''[[The West Australian]]'' discussing the Coca-Cola bottle incident within ten days of the lunar landing.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bennett &amp; Percy|Bennett &amp; Percy 2001]], pp. 319–20&lt;/ref&gt;

10. The book ''[[Moon Shot]]''&lt;ref&gt;[[#Shepard &amp; Slayton|Shepard &amp; Slayton 1994]] (page needed)&lt;/ref&gt; contains an obviously fake composite photo of Alan Shepard hitting a golf ball on the Moon with another astronaut.

:* '' It was used instead of the only existing real images, from the TV monitor, which the editors seemingly felt were too grainy for their book. The book publishers did not work for NASA.''

11. There appear to be "hot spots" in some photos that look like a large spotlight was used in place of the sun.

:* '' Pits on the Moon's surface focus and reflect light like the tiny glass spheres used in the coating of street signs, or dewdrops on wet grass. This creates a glow around the photographer's own shadow when it appears in a photograph (see [[Heiligenschein]]).''
:* ''If the astronaut is standing in sunlight while photographing into shade, light reflected off his white spacesuit yields a similar effect to a spotlight.&lt;ref name="bootspot" /&gt;''
:* ''Some widely published Apollo photos were high-contrast copies. Scans of the original transparencies are generally much more evenly lit. An example is shown below:''

12. Who filmed Neil Armstrong stepping onto the Moon?

:* ''The Lunar Module did. While still on the Module's ladder steps, Armstrong deployed the Modularized Equipment Stowage Assembly from the side of the Lunar Module, unpacking, amongst other things, the TV camera. The TV camera was then powered on and a signal transmitted to the command module, which beamed the live signal back to Earth. This meant that upwards of 600 million people on Earth could watch the live feed with only a very slight delay. Similar technology was also used on subsequent Apollo missions.''

=== Environment ===
1. The astronauts could not have survived the trip because of exposure to radiation from the [[Van Allen radiation belt]] and galactic ambient radiation (see [[Acute radiation syndrome|radiation poisoning]] and [[health threat from cosmic rays]]). Some conspiracists have suggested that [[Starfish Prime]] (a [[High-altitude nuclear explosion|high-altitude nuclear test]] in 1962) was a failed attempt to disrupt the Van Allen belts.

:* ''There are two main Van Allen belts – the inner belt and the outer belt – and a transient third belt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2013/28feb_thirdbelt/ |title=Van Allen Probes Discover a New Radiation Belt |work=Science@NASA |publisher=NASA |date=February 28, 2013 |editor-last=Phillips |editor-first=Tony |accessdate=May 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inner belt is the more dangerous one, containing energetic protons. The outer one has less-dangerous low-energy electrons ([[Beta particle]]s).&lt;ref name="vanallenbelts"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://image.gsfc.nasa.gov/poetry/tour/AAvan.html |title=The Van Allen Belts |website=IMAGE Science Center |publisher=NASA |accessdate=May 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="woods109"&gt;[[#Woods|Woods 2008]], p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; The Apollo spacecraft passed through the inner belt in a matter of minutes and the outer belt in about {{frac|1|1|2}} hours.&lt;ref name="woods109" /&gt; The astronauts were shielded from the ionizing radiation by the aluminum hulls of the spacecraft.&lt;ref name="woods109" /&gt;&lt;ref name="plait162"&gt;[[#Plait|Plait 2002]], p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the orbital transfer trajectory from Earth to the Moon through the belts was chosen to lessen radiation exposure.&lt;ref name="plait162" /&gt; Even Dr. [[James Van Allen]], the discoverer of the Van Allen radiation belts, rebutted the claims that radiation levels were too harmful for the Apollo missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clavius.org/envrad.html |title=Clavius: Environment – radiation and the van allen belts |last=Windley |first=Jay |website=Moon Base Clavius |publisher=Clavius.org |accessdate=September 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plait cited an average dose of less than 1&amp;nbsp;[[Röntgen equivalent man|rem]] (10&amp;nbsp;[[Sievert|mSv]]), which is equivalent to the ambient radiation received by living at sea level for three years.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Plait|Plait 2002]], pp. 160–62&lt;/ref&gt; The total radiation received on the trip was about the same as allowed for workers in the nuclear energy field for a year''&lt;ref name="woods109" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lsda.jsc.nasa.gov/books/apollo/s2ch3.htm |title=Radiation Protection and Instrumentation |last=Bailey |first=J.

2. Film in the cameras would have been fogged by this radiation.

:* ''The film was kept in metal containers that stopped radiation from fogging the film's emulsion.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Plait|Plait 2002]], pp. 162–63&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, film carried by unmanned lunar probes such as the [[Lunar Orbiter program|Lunar Orbiter]] and [[Luna 3]] (which used on-board film development processes) was not fogged.''

3. The Moon's surface during the daytime is so hot that camera film would have melted.

:* ''There is no atmosphere to efficiently bind lunar surface heat to devices (such as cameras) that are not in direct contact with it. In a [[vacuum]], only radiation remains as a heat transfer mechanism. The physics of radiative heat transfer are thoroughly understood, and the proper use of passive optical coatings and paints was enough to control the temperature of the film within the cameras; Lunar Module temperatures were controlled with similar coatings that gave them a gold color. Also, while the Moon's surface does get very hot at lunar noon, every Apollo landing was made shortly after lunar sunrise at the landing site; the [[Lunar day|Moon's day]] is about 29½ Earth days long, meaning that one Moon day (dawn to dusk) lasts nearly fifteen Earth days. During the longer stays, the astronauts did notice increased cooling loads on their spacesuits as the sun and surface temperature continued to rise, but the effect was easily countered by the passive and active cooling systems.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Plait|Plait 2002]], pp. 165–67&lt;/ref&gt; The film was not in direct sunlight, so it was not overheated.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clavius.org/envheat.html |title=Clavius: Environment – heat |last=Windley |first=Jay |website=Moon Base Clavius |publisher=Clavius.org |accessdate=November 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;''

4. The Apollo 16 crew could not have survived a big [[solar flare]] firing out when they were on their way to the Moon.

:* ''No large solar flare occurred during the flight of Apollo 16. There were large solar flares in August 1972, after Apollo 16 returned to Earth and before the flight of [[Apollo 17]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://science1.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2005/27jan_solarflares/ |title=Sickening Solar Flares |last=Phillips |first=Tony |date=January 27, 2005 |work=Science@NASA |publisher=NASA |accessdate=November 25, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615021549/http://science1.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2005/27jan_solarflares/ |archivedate=June 15, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Predicting Solar Eruptions |first=Selby |last=Cull |url=http://www.skyandtelescope.com/news/3422566.html?page=1&amp;c=y |work=News from Sky &amp; Telescope |publisher=Sky Publishing |date=July 12, 2006 |accessdate=November 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

5. The [[Lunar Flag Assembly|flag]] placed on the surface by the astronauts fluttered despite there being no wind on the Moon. This suggests that it was filmed on Earth and a breeze caused the flag to flutter. Sibrel said that it may have been caused by indoor fans used to cool the astronauts since their spacesuit cooling systems would have been too heavy on Earth.

:* ''The flag was fastened to a'' Г-''shaped rod (see [[Lunar Flag Assembly]]) so that it did not hang down. The flag only seemed to flutter when the astronauts were moving it into position. Without air drag, these movements caused the free corner of the flag to swing like a [[pendulum]] for some time. The flag was rippled because it had been folded during storage – the ripples could be mistaken for movement in a still photo. Videos show that when the astronauts let go of the flagpole it vibrates briefly but then remains still''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clavius.org/envflutter.html |title=Clavius: Environment: fluttering flags |last=Windley |first=Jay |website=Moon Base Clavius |publisher=Clavius.org |accessdate=April 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Harrison|Harrison 2012]], p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#McAdams|McAdams 2011]], p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

6. Footprints in the [[Moondust]] are unexpectedly well preserved, despite the lack of moisture.

:* ''Moondust has not been weathered like Earth sand and has sharp edges. This allows the dust particles to stick together and hold their shape in the vacuum. The astronauts likened it to "talcum powder or wet sand".''&lt;ref name="whomourns" /&gt;
:* This theory was further debunked on the ''MythBusters'' episode "[[MythBusters (2008 season)#Episode 104 – "NASA Moon Landing"|NASA Moon Landing]]".

7. The alleged Moon landings used either a sound stage or were filmed outside in a remote desert with the astronauts either using harnesses or slow-motion photography to make it look like they were on the Moon.

:* ''While the [[HBO]] [[miniseries]] "[[From the Earth to the Moon (miniseries)|From the Earth to the Moon]]", and a scene from the movie "[[Apollo 13 (film)|Apollo 13]]" used the sound-stage and harness setup, it is clearly seen from those films that when dust rose it did not quickly settle; some dust briefly formed clouds. In the film footage from the Apollo missions, dust kicked up by the astronauts' boots and the wheels of the [[Lunar Roving Vehicle]]s rose quite high due to the lower lunar gravity, and settled quickly to the ground in an uninterrupted parabolic arc since there was no air to suspend the dust. Even if there had been a sound stage for hoax Moon landings that had the air pumped out, the dust would have reached nowhere near the height and trajectory as in the Apollo film footage because of Earth's greater gravity.

:* ''During the Apollo 15 mission, [[David Scott]] did an experiment by dropping a hammer and a falcon feather at the same time. Both fell at the same rate and hit the ground at the same time. This proved that he was in a vacuum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite APOD |title=Hammer Versus Feather on the Moon |date=November 1, 2011 |access-date=April 20, 2013}} Source for video: {{YouTube|id=4mTsrRZEMwA|title="The Hammer and the Feather"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:* ''If the landings were filmed outside in a desert, heat waves would be present on the surface in mission videos, but no such heat waves exist in the footage. If the landings were filmed in a sound stage, several anomalies would occur, including a lack of parallax, and an increase or decrease in the size of the backdrop if the camera moved (footage was filmed while the rover was in motion, and yet no evidence of any change in the size of the background is present).

:* This theory was further debunked on the ''MythBusters'' episode "[[MythBusters (2008 season)#Episode 104 – "NASA Moon Landing"|NASA Moon Landing]]".

=== Mechanical issues ===
[[File:Apollo11 under LM.jpg|right|thumb|Under the Apollo 11 Lunar Module]]

1. The Lunar Modules made no blast [[Explosion crater|craters]] or any sign of dust scatter.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kaysing|Kaysing 2002]], p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

:* ''No crater should be expected. The 10,000-pound thrust [[Descent Propulsion System]] was throttled very far down during the final landing.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Harrison|Harrison 2012]], p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; The Lunar Module was no longer quickly decelerating, so the descent engine only had to support the lander's own weight, which was lessened by the Moon's gravity and by the near exhaustion of the descent propellants. At landing, the engine thrust divided by the nozzle exit area is only about 10 [[Pascal (unit)|kilopascals]] (1.5 [[Pounds per square inch|PSI]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Plait|Plait 2002]], p. 164&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond the engine nozzle, the plume spreads, and the pressure drops very quickly. Rocket exhaust gasses expand much more quickly after leaving the engine nozzle in a vacuum than in an atmosphere. The effect of an atmosphere on rocket plumes can be easily seen in launches from Earth; as the rocket rises through the thinning atmosphere, the exhaust plumes broaden very noticeably. To lessen this, rocket engines made for vacuums have longer bells than those made for use on Earth, but they still cannot stop this spreading. The lander's exhaust gasses, therefore, expanded quickly well beyond the landing site. The descent engines &lt;u&gt;did&lt;/u&gt; scatter a lot of very fine surface dust as seen in [[16 mm film|16mm movies]] of each landing, and many mission commanders spoke of its effect on visibility. The landers were generally moving horizontally as well as vertically, and photos do show scouring of the surface along the final descent path. Finally, the lunar [[regolith]] is very compact below its surface dust layer, making it impossible for the descent engine to blast out a "crater".&lt;ref name=ba-pg163-165&gt;[[#Plait|Plait 2002]], pp. 163–65&lt;/ref&gt; A blast crater was measured under the Apollo 11 lander using shadow lengths of the descent engine bell and estimates of the amount that the landing gear had compressed and how deep the lander footpads had pressed into the lunar surface and it was found that the engine had eroded between 4 and 6 inches of regolith out from underneath the engine bell during the final descent and landing.''&lt;ref name="as11psr"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/as11psr.pdf |title=Apollo 11 Preliminary Science Report |year=1969 |publisher=NASA |format=PDF |id=NASA SP-214 |accessdate=May 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2. The second stage of the launch rocket and/or the Lunar Module [[Apollo Lunar Module#Ascent stage|ascent stage]] made no visible flame.

:* ''The Lunar Modules used [[Aerozine 50]] (fuel) and [[dinitrogen tetroxide]] (oxidizer) propellants, chosen for simplicity and reliability; they ignite [[hypergolic propellant|hypergolically]] – upon contact – without the need for a spark. These propellants produce a nearly [[transparent materials|transparent]] exhaust.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Woods|Woods 2008]], p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; The same fuel was used by the core of the American [[Titan II GLV|Titan II]] rocket. The transparency of their plumes is apparent in many launch photos. The plumes of rocket engines fired in a vacuum spread out very quickly as they leave the engine nozzle (see above), further lessening their visibility. Finally, rocket engines often run "rich" to slow internal corrosion. On Earth, the excess fuel burns in contact with atmospheric oxygen, enhancing the visible flame. This cannot happen in a vacuum.''

&lt;/center&gt;

3. The Lunar Modules weighed 17 tons and made no mark on the Moondust, yet footprints can be seen beside them.&lt;ref&gt;[[#René|René 1994]] pp. n, 11&lt;/ref&gt;

:* ''On the surface of the Earth, Apollo 11's fueled and crewed Lunar Module, Eagle, would have weighed approximately 17 [[short ton]]s (15,300&amp;nbsp;kg). On the surface of the Moon, however, after expending fuel and oxidizer on her descent from lunar orbit, the lander weighed about {{convert|2698|lb|kg|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4029/SP-4029.htm |title=Apollo by the Numbers: A Statistical Reference |last=Orloff |first=Richard W. |origyear=First published 2000 |date=September 2004 |website=NASA History Program Office |publisher=NASA |isbn=0-16-050631-X |id=NASA SP-2000-4029 |accessdate=May 31, 2013}} See Statistical Tables: [https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4029/Apollo_18-37_Selected_Mission_Weights.htm "Selected Mission Weights (lbs)"] and [https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4029/Apollo_18-28a_LM_Descent_Stage_Propellant_Status.htm "LM Descent Stage Propellant Status"].&lt;/ref&gt; The astronauts were much lighter than the lander, but their boots were much smaller than the lander's approximately {{convert|3|ft|cm|adj=on}} diameter footpads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/LM_Landing%20Gear1973010151.pdf |title=Apollo Lunar Module Landing Gear |last=Rogers |first=William F. |work=Apollo Lunar Surface Journal |publisher=NASA |format=PDF |accessdate=May 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pressure (or force per unit area) rather than mass determines the amount of regolith compression. In some photos, the footpads &lt;u&gt;did&lt;/u&gt; press into the regolith, especially when they moved sideways at touchdown. (The bearing pressure under Apollo 11's footpads, with the lander being about 44 times the weight of an EVA-configured astronaut, would have been of similar magnitude to the bearing pressure exerted by the astronauts' boots.)''&lt;ref&gt;[[#Heiken|Heiken 1991]], pp. 475–476&lt;/ref&gt;

4. The air conditioning units that were part of the astronauts' spacesuits could not have worked in an environment of no atmosphere.&lt;ref name="cooper" /&gt;

:* ''The cooling units could &lt;u&gt;only&lt;/u&gt; work in a vacuum. Water from a tank in the backpack flowed out through tiny pores in a metal [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimator]] plate where it quickly vaporized into space. The loss of the heat of vaporization froze the remaining water, forming a layer of ice on the outside of the plate that also sublimated into space (turning from a solid directly into a gas). A separate water loop flowed through the LCG ([[Liquid Cooling and Ventilation Garment|Liquid Cooling Garment]]) worn by the astronaut, carrying his metabolic waste heat through the sublimator plate where it was cooled and returned to the LCG. {{convert|12|lb|kg|spell=In}} of feedwater gave about eight hours of cooling; because of its bulk, it was often the limiting consumable on the length of an EVA.

[[File:Surveyor 3-Apollo 12.jpg|thumb|right|[[Surveyor 3]] with [[Apollo 12]] lander in background]]

=== Transmissions ===
1. There should have been more than a two-second delay in communications between Earth and the Moon, at a distance of {{convert|400000|km|mi|abbr=on}}.

:* ''The round trip light travel time of more than two seconds is apparent in all the real-time recordings of the lunar audio, but this does not always appear as expected. There may also be some documentary films where the delay has been edited out. Reasons for editing the audio may be time constraints or in the interest of clarity.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redzero.demon.co.uk/moonhoax/Radio.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080729183941/http://www.redzero.demon.co.uk/moonhoax/Radio.htm |archivedate=July 29, 2008 |title=Radio Lag |publisher=Redzero.demon.co.uk |accessdate=November 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2. Typical delays in communication were about 0.5 seconds.

:* ''Claims that the delays were only half a second are untrue, as examination of the original recordings shows. Also, there should not be a consistent time delay between every response, as the conversation is being recorded at one end – [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center|Mission Control]]. Responses from Mission Control could be heard without any delay, as the recording is being made at the same time that Houston receives the transmission from the Moon.''

3. The [[Parkes Observatory]] in Australia was billed to the world for weeks as the site that would be relaying communications from the first moonwalk. However, five hours before transmission they were told to stand down.

:* ''The timing of the first moonwalk was changed after the landing.

Dr. David R. Williams (NASA archivist at [[Goddard Space Flight Center]]) and Apollo 11 flight director [[Gene Kranz|Eugene F. Kranz]] both acknowledged that the original high-quality Apollo 11 telemetry data tapes are missing. Conspiracists see this as evidence that they never existed.&lt;ref name="didwego" /&gt; The Apollo 11 telemetry tapes were different from the telemetry tapes of the other Moon landings because they contained the raw television broadcast. For technical reasons, the Apollo 11 lander carried a [[slow-scan television]] (SSTV) camera (see [[Apollo TV camera]]). To broadcast the pictures to regular television, a [[scan conversion]] had to be done. The [[radio telescope]] at Parkes Observatory in Australia was able to receive the telemetry from the Moon at the time of the Apollo 11 moonwalk.&lt;ref name="eagleswings2"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sarkissian |first=John M. |title=On Eagle's Wings: The Parkes Observatory's Support of the Apollo 11 Mission |year=2001 |journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of Australia |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=287–310 |location=Collingwood, Victoria |publisher=[[CSIRO Publishing]] for the [[Astronomical Society of Australia]] |doi=10.1071/AS01038 |accessdate=November 25, 2008 |url=http://www.parkes.atnf.csiro.au/news_events/apollo11/|bibcode = 2001PASA...18..287S }} October 2000 website version, part 1 of 12: "Introduction."

It also received a better picture than NASA's antenna at [[Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex]]. This direct TV signal, along with telemetry data, was recorded onto one-inch fourteen-track analog tape at Parkes. The original SSTV transmission had better detail and contrast than the scan-converted pictures, and it is this tape that is missing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parkes.atnf.csiro.au/news_events/apollo11/Parkes_Apollo11_TV_quality.html |title=The Parkes Apollo 11 TV Quality |last=Sarkissian |first=John M. |publisher=[[Parkes Observatory|CSIRO Parkes Observatory]] |accessdate=November 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A crude, real-time scan conversion of the SSTV signal was done in Australia before it was broadcast worldwide. However, still photos of the original SSTV image are available (see photos). About fifteen minutes of it were filmed by an amateur [[8 mm film]] camera and these are also available. Later Apollo missions did not use SSTV. At least some of the telemetry tapes from the [[Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package|ALSEP]] scientific experiments left on the Moon (which ran until 1977) still exist, according to Dr. Williams. Copies of those tapes have been found.&lt;ref name="Amalfi"&gt;{{cite news |title=Lost Moon landing tapes discovered |last=Amalfi |first=Carmelo |url=http://www.cosmosmagazine.com/features/lost-moon-landing-tapes-discovered/ |work=COSMOS Online |publisher=Cosmos Media Pty Ltd |location=Australia |date=November 1, 2006 |accessdate=November 25, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130214030100/http://www.cosmosmagazine.com/features/lost-moon-landing-tapes-discovered/ |archivedate=February 14, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others are looking for the missing telemetry tapes for different reasons. The tapes contain the original and highest quality video feed from the Apollo 11 landing. Some former Apollo personnel want to find the tapes for posterity while NASA engineers looking towards future Moon missions believe the tapes may be useful for their design studies. They have found that the Apollo 11 tapes were sent for storage at the U.S. National Archives in 1970, but by 1984, all the Apollo 11 tapes had been returned to the Goddard Space Flight Center at their request. The tapes are believed to have been stored rather than re-used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.honeysucklecreek.net/Apollo_11/tapes/Search_for_SSTV_Tapes.pdf |title=The Search for the Apollo 11 SSTV Tapes |last=Sarkissian |first=John M. |date=May 21, 2006 |website=Honeysucklecreek.net |publisher=CSIRO Parkes Observatory |format=PDF |accessdate=April 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goddard was storing 35,000 new tapes per year in 1967,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19670010532_1967010532.pdf| accessdate=September 5, 2009| format=PDF| title=The GSFC Scientific Data Storage Problem| publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; even before the Moon landings.

In November 2006, [[Cosmos (magazine)|COSMOS Online]] reported that about 100 data tapes recorded in Australia during the Apollo 11 mission had been found in a small marine science laboratory in the main physics building at the [[Curtin University of Technology]] in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth, Australia]]. One of the old tapes has been sent to NASA for analysis. The slow-scan television images were not on the tape.&lt;ref name="Amalfi" /&gt;

In July 2009, NASA indicated that it must have erased the original Apollo 11 Moon footage years ago so that it could re-use the tape. In December 2009 NASA issued a final report on the Apollo 11 telemetry tapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/Apollo_11_TV_Tapes_Report.pdf |title=The Apollo 11 Telemetry Data Recordings: A Final Report |date=December 2009 |publisher=NASA |format=PDF |accessdate=April 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senior engineer Dick Nafzger, who was in charge of the live TV recordings during the Apollo missions, was put in charge of the restoration project. After a three-year search, the "inescapable conclusion" was that about 45 tapes (estimated 15 tapes recorded at each of the three tracking stations) of Apollo 11 video were erased and re-used, said Nafzger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usnews.com/science/articles/2009/07/17/nasa-lost-moon-footage-but-hollywood-restores-it |title=NASA lost moon footage, but Hollywood restores it |date=July 17, 2009 |first=Seth |last=Borenstein |agency=Associated Press |newspaper=[[US News &amp; World Report]] |accessdate=September 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In time for the 40th anniversary of the Apollo 11 landing, [[Lowry Digital]] had been tasked with restoring the surviving footage. Lowry Digital president Mike Inchalik said that, "this is by far and away the lowest quality" video the company has dealt with. Nafzger praised Lowry for restoring "crispness" to the Apollo video, which will remain in black and white and contains conservative digital enhancements. The US$230,000 restoration project took months to complete and did not include sound quality improvements. Some selections of restored footage in high-definition have been made available on the NASA website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/hd/apollo11.html |title=Apollo 11 Partial Restoration HD Video Streams |date=August 7, 2009 |editor-last=Garner |editor-first=Robert |publisher=NASA |accessdate=September 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Technology ===
{{See also|Space Race|List of space exploration milestones, 1957–1969}}

Bart Sibrel cites the relative level of the United States and USSR space technology as evidence that the Moon landings could not have happened. For much of the early stages of the Space Race, the USSR was ahead of the United States, yet in the end, the USSR was never able to fly a manned craft to the Moon, let alone land one on the surface. It is argued that, because the USSR was unable to do this, the United States should have also been unable to develop the technology to do so.

For example, he claims that, during the Apollo program, the USSR had five times more manned hours in space than the United States, and notes that the USSR was the first to achieve many of the early milestones in space: the first man-made [[satellite]] in [[orbit]] (October 1957, [[Sputnik 1]]);&lt;ref group=Note&gt;According to the 2007 ''[[Nova (TV series)|NOVA]]'' episode "[[List of Nova episodes#Season 35: 2007–2008|Sputnik Declassified]]," the United States could have launched the ''[[Explorer 1]]'' probe before Sputnik, but the [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] administration hesitated, first because they were not sure if international law meant that national borders kept going all the way into orbit (and, thus, their orbiting satellite could cause an international uproar by violating the borders of dozens of nations), and second because there was a desire to see the not yet ready [[Project Vanguard|Vanguard satellite program]], designed by American citizens, become America's first satellite rather than the Explorer program, that was mostly designed by former rocket designers from [[Nazi Germany]]. A transcript of the appropriate section from the show is available at "[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/space/sputnik-impact-on-america.html Sputnik's Impact on America]."&lt;/ref&gt; the first living creature in orbit (a [[dog]] named [[Laika]], November 1957, [[Sputnik 2]]); the first man in space and in orbit ([[Yuri Gagarin]], April 1961, [[Vostok 1]]); the first woman in space ([[Valentina Tereshkova]], June 1963, [[Vostok 6]]); and the first spacewalk (EVA) ([[Alexei Leonov]] in March 1965, [[Voskhod 2]]).

However, most of the Soviet gains listed above were matched by the United States within a year, and sometimes within weeks. In 1965, the United States started to achieve many firsts (such as the first successful [[space rendezvous]]), which were important steps in a mission to the Moon. Furthermore, NASA and others say that these gains by the Soviets are not as impressive as they seem; that a number of these firsts were mere stunts that did not advance the technology greatly, or at all, ''e.g.'', the first woman in space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clavius.org/techsoviet.html |title=Clavius: Technology – beating the soviets |last=Windley |first=Jay |website=Moon Base Clavius |publisher=Clavius.org |accessdate=September 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.nasa.gov/ISS_Science_Blog/2013/06/17/women-in-space-part-one-female-firsts-in-flight-for-space-exploration-and-research/ |title=Women in Space Part One, Female Firsts in Flight for Space Exploration and Research |last=Warren |first=Liz |date=June 17, 2013 |work=A Lab Aloft |publisher=NASA Blogs |type=Blog |accessdate=July 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, by the time of the launch of the first manned Earth-orbiting Apollo flight ([[Apollo 7]]), the USSR had made only nine [[spaceflight]]s (seven with one cosmonaut, one with two, one with three) compared to 16 by the United States. In terms of spacecraft hours, the USSR had 460 hours of spaceflight; the United States had 1,024 hours. In terms of astronaut/cosmonaut time, the USSR had 534 hours of manned spaceflight whereas the United States had 1,992 hours. By the time of Apollo 11, the United States had a lead much wider than that. (See [[List of human spaceflights, 1961–1970]], and refer to individual flights for the length of time.)

Moreover, the USSR did not develop a successful rocket capable of a manned lunar mission until the 1980s – their [[N1 (rocket)|N1 rocket]] failed on all four launch attempts between 1969 and 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astronautix.com/flights/sovnding.htm |title=Soviet Lunar Landing |work=[[Encyclopedia Astronautica]] |publisher=Mark Wade |accessdate=November 25, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224200322/http://www.astronautix.com/flights/sovnding.htm |archivedate=February 24, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet [[LK (spacecraft)|LK]] lunar lander was tested in unmanned low-Earth-orbit flights three times in 1970 and 1971.

=== Deaths of NASA personnel ===
In a televised program about the moon-landing hoax allegations, [[Fox Entertainment Group]] listed the deaths of ten astronauts and two civilians related to the manned spaceflight program as part of an alleged cover-up.
* [[Theodore Freeman]] (killed ejecting from a [[T-38 Talon|T-38]] which had suffered a [[bird strike]], October 1964)
* [[Elliot See]] and [[Charles Bassett|Charlie Bassett]] ([[1966 NASA T-38 crash|T-38 crash in bad weather]], February 1966)
* [[Gus Grissom|Virgil "Gus" Grissom]], [[Ed White (astronaut)|Ed White]], and [[Roger B. Chaffee]] (killed in a fire during the "plugs-out test" preceding [[Apollo 1]], January 1967)
* [[Edward Givens|Edward "Ed" Givens]] (killed in a car accident, June 1967)
* [[Clifton Williams|Clifton "C. C." Williams]] (killed ejecting from a T-38, October 1967)
* [[Michael James Adams|Michael J. "Mike" Adams]] (died in an [[North American X-15|X-15]] crash, November 1967. Adams was the only pilot killed during the X-15 flight test program. He was a test pilot, not a NASA astronaut, but had flown the X-15 above 50 miles.)
* [[Robert Henry Lawrence, Jr.]] (killed in an [[F-104 Starfighter|F-104]] crash, December 1967, shortly after being selected as a pilot with the [[United States Air Force]]'s (later cancelled) [[Manned Orbiting Laboratory]] (MOL) program.)
* [[Thomas Baron|Thomas Ronald Baron]] ([[North American Aviation]] employee. Baron died in an automobile collision with a train, April 27, 1967, six days after testifying before [[United States House of Representatives|Rep.]] [[Olin E. Teague]]'s House Subcommittee on NASA Oversight hearings held following the Apollo 1 fire, after which he was fired). Baron was a quality control inspector who wrote a report critical of the Apollo program and was an outspoken critic of NASA's safety record after the Apollo 1 fire. Baron and his family were killed as their car was struck by a train at a train crossing. The deaths were an accident.&lt;ref name="not_faked"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pirlwww.lpl.arizona.edu/~jscotti/NOT_faked/FOX.html |title=Comments on the FOX special on the Hoax |first=Jim | last=Scotti |website=Lunar and Planetary Laboratory |publisher=University of Arizona |accessdate=November 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://history.nasa.gov/Apollo204/barron.html |title=NASA Apollo Mission Apollo-1 – Baron Report |website=NASA History Program Office |publisher=NASA |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921155820/https://history.nasa.gov/Apollo204/barron.html |archivedate=September 21, 2008 |accessdate=November 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of the above, X-15 pilot Mike Adams and MOL pilot Robert Lawrence, had no connection with the civilian manned space program that oversaw the Apollo missions. All of the deaths listed besides Welch occurred at least 20 months ''before'' Apollo 11 and subsequent flights.

As of November 2018, four of the twelve [[List of Apollo Astronauts#Apollo astronauts who walked on the Moon|Apollo astronauts who landed on the Moon]] between 1969 and 1972 are still alive, including Buzz Aldrin. Also, nine of the twelve [[List of Apollo Astronauts#Apollo astronauts who flew to the Moon without landing|Apollo astronauts who flew to the Moon without landing]] between 1968 and 1972 are still alive, including [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]].

The number of deaths within the American astronaut corps during the run-up to Apollo and during the Apollo missions is similar to the number of deaths incurred by the Russians. During the period 1961 to 1972, at least eight Russian serving and former cosmonauts died:
* [[Valentin Bondarenko]] (ground training accident, March 1961)
* [[Grigori Nelyubov]] (suicide, February 1966)
* [[Vladimir Komarov]] (''[[Soyuz 1]]'' accident, April 1967)
* [[Yuri Gagarin]] ([[MiG-15]] crash, March 1968)
* [[Pavel Belyayev]] (complications following surgery, January 1970)
* [[Georgi Dobrovolski]], [[Vladislav Volkov]], and [[Viktor Patsayev]] (''[[Soyuz 11]]'' accident, June 1971)

Additionally, the overall chief of their manned-spaceflight program, [[Sergei Korolev]], died while undergoing surgery in January 1966.

=== NASA response ===
In June 1977, NASA issued a fact sheet responding to recent claims that the Apollo Moon landings had been hoaxed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=ftp://ftp.hq.nasa.gov/pub/pao/media/2001/lunar_landing.pdf |title=Did U.S. Astronauts Really Land on the Moon |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=February 14, 2001 |publisher=NASA |location=Washington, D.C. |type=Reissue (June 1977) |format=PDF |accessdate=April 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact sheet is particularly blunt and regards the idea of faking the Moon landings to be preposterous and outlandish. NASA refers to the rocks and particles collected from the Moon as being evidence of the program's legitimacy, as they claim that these rocks could not have been formed under conditions on earth. NASA also notes that all of the operations and phases of the Apollo program were closely followed and under the scrutiny of the news media, from liftoff to splashdown. NASA responds to Bill Kaysing's book, ''We Never Went to the Moon'', by identifying one of his claims of fraud regarding the lack of a crater left on the Moon's surface by the landing of the lunar module, and refuting it with facts about the soil and cohesive nature of the surface of the Moon.

The fact sheet was reissued on February 14, 2001, the day before Fox television's broadcast of ''Conspiracy Theory: Did We Land on the Moon?'' The documentary reinvigorated the public's interest in conspiracy theories and the possibility that the Moon landings were faked, which has provoked NASA to once again defend its name.

=== Alleged Stanley Kubrick involvement ===

Filmmaker [[Stanley Kubrick]] is accused of having produced much of the footage for Apollos 11 and 12, presumably because he had just directed ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', which is partly set on the Moon and featured advanced special effects.&lt;ref name="clydelewis" /&gt; It has been claimed that when ''2001'' was in [[post-production]] in early 1968, NASA secretly approached Kubrick to direct the first three Moon landings. The launch and splashdown would be real but the spacecraft would stay in Earth orbit and fake footage broadcast as "live from the Moon." No evidence was offered for this theory, which overlooks many facts. For example, ''2001'' was released before the first Apollo landing and Kubrick's depiction of the Moon's surface differs greatly from its appearance in Apollo video, film, and photography. Movements of astronauts in ''2001'' differs from that of the Apollo astronauts, and does not resemble an environment with 1/6 the gravity of Earth. Several scenes of ''2001'' show billowing of dust as spacecraft landed, something that would not happen in the vacuum environment of the Moon. Kubrick did hire [[Frederick I. Ordway III|Frederick Ordway]] and [[Harry Lange (film designer)|Harry Lange]], both of whom had worked for NASA and major aerospace contractors, to work with him on ''2001''. Kubrick also used some 50&amp;nbsp;mm f/0.7 lenses that were left over from a batch made by [[Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss]] for NASA. However, Kubrick only got this lens for ''[[Barry Lyndon]]'' (1975). The lens was originally a still photo lens and needed changes to be used for motion filming.

The [[mockumentary]] based on this idea, ''[[Dark Side of the Moon (documentary)|Dark Side of the Moon]]'', could have fueled the conspiracy theory. This French mockumentary, directed by William Karel, was originally aired on Arte channel in 2002 with the title ''Opération Lune''. It parodies conspiracy theories with faked interviews, stories of assassinations of Stanley Kubrick's assistants by the CIA, and a variety of conspicuous mistakes, puns, and references to old movie characters, inserted through the film as clues for the viewer. Nevertheless, ''Opération Lune'' is still taken at face value by some conspiracy believers.

An article entitled "Stanley Kubrick and the Moon Hoax" appeared on Usenet in 1995, in the newsgroup "alt.humor.best-of-usenet". One passage – on how Kubrick was supposedly coerced into the conspiracy – reads:

&lt;blockquote&gt;NASA further leveraged their position by threatening to publicly reveal the heavy involvement of Mr. Kubrick's younger brother, Raul, with the [[American Communist Party]]. This would have been an intolerable embarrassment to Mr. Kubrick, especially since the release of ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kubrick had no such brother – the article was a spoof, complete with a giveaway sentence describing Kubrick shooting the moonwalk "on location" on the Moon. Nevertheless, the claim was taken up in earnest;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clavius.org/bibkubrick.html |title=Clavius: Bibliography – the kubrick article |last=Windley |first=Jay |website=Moon Base Clavius |publisher=Clavius.org |accessdate=April 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clyde Lewis used it almost word-for-word,&lt;ref name="clydelewis" /&gt; whereas [[Room 237|Jay Weidner]] gave the brother a more senior status within the party:

&lt;blockquote&gt;No one knows how the powers-that-be convinced Kubrick to direct the Apollo landings. Maybe they had compromised Kubrick in some way. The fact that his brother, Raul Kubrick, was the head of the American Communist Party may have been one of the avenues pursued by the government to get Stanley to cooperate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Weidner |first=Jay |url=http://jayweidner.com/AlchemicalKubrickIIa.html |title=How Stanley Kubrick Faked the Apollo Moon Landings |work=jayweidner.com |date=July 20, 2009 |accessdate=June 24, 2017 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123205838/http://jayweidner.com/AlchemicalKubrickIIa.html |archivedate=November 23, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In July 2009, Weidner posted on his webpage "Secrets of the Shining", where he states that Kubrick's ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]'' (1980) is a veiled confession of his role in the scam project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/luna/luna_apollomissions10.htm |title=Secrets of the Shining |last=Weidner |first=Jay |website=Bibliotecapleyades.net |date=July 20, 2009 |accessdate=June 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|7hRgQ-Qk7u8|Faked Moon Landing Hidden Subliminal Messages in Stanley Kubrick's Movie 'The Shining'}}.

The 2015 movie ''[[Moonwalkers (film)|Moonwalkers]]'' is a fictional account of a CIA agent's claim of Kubrick's involvement.

In December 2015, a video surfaced which allegedly shows Kubrick being interviewed shortly before his 1999 death; the video purportedly shows the director confessing to T. Patrick Murray that the Apollo Moon landings had been faked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/science/626119/MOON-LANDINGS-FAKE-Shock-video-Stanley-Kubrick-admit-historic-event-HOAX-NASA |title=Moon Landings 'Fake': Shock video shows 'Stanley Kubrick' admit historic event was 'HOAX' |last=Austin |first=Jon |publisher=''[[Daily Express]]'' |date=December 11, 2015 |accessdate=December 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research quickly found, however, that the video was a [[hoax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/false-stanley-kubrick-faked-moon-landings/ |title=Lie Me to the Moon |last=Evon |first=Dan |publisher=[[Snopes.com]] |date=December 11, 2015 |accessdate=December 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, NASA granted US$15,000 to James Oberg for a commission to write a point-by-point rebuttal of the hoax claims. However, NASA canceled the commission later that year, after complaints that the book would dignify the accusations.&lt;ref name="Fake Moon Flight' Myth 2003, pp. 23, 30" /&gt; Oberg said that he meant to finish the book.&lt;ref name="Fake Moon Flight' Myth 2003, pp. 23, 30" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/2424927.stm| accessdate=August 26, 2009| title=Nasa pulls Moon hoax book| date=November 8, 2002| first=David| last=Whitehouse|work=BBC News | location = London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2002, [[Peter Jennings]] said "NASA is going to spend a few thousand dollars trying to prove to some people that the United States did indeed land men on the Moon," and "NASA had been so rattled, [they] hired [somebody] to write a book refuting the conspiracy theorists." Oberg says that belief in the hoax theories is not the fault of the conspiracists, but rather that of teachers and people (including NASA) who should provide information to the public.&lt;ref name="Fake Moon Flight' Myth 2003, pp. 23, 30" /&gt;

=== ''MythBusters'' special ===
{{Main|MythBusters (2008 season)#Episode 104 – "NASA Moon Landing"|l1=Mythbusters "NASA Moon Landing" episode}}

An episode of ''[[MythBusters]]'' in August 2008 was dedicated to the Moon landings. The ''MythBusters'' crew tested many of the conspiracists' claims. Some of the testings were done in a NASA training facility. All of the conspiracists' claims examined on the show were labeled as having been "Busted", meaning that the conspiracists' claims were not true.

Moon-landing conspiracists claim that observatories and the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] should be able to photograph the landing sites. This implies that the world's major observatories (as well as the Hubble Program) are complicit in the hoax by refusing to take photos of the landing sites. Photos of the Moon have been taken by Hubble, including at least two Apollo landing sites, but the Hubble resolution limits viewing of lunar objects to sizes no smaller than {{convert|60|–|75|yds|m|abbr=off|sp=us}}, which is insufficient resolution to see any landing site features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/vision/universe/solarsystem/hubble_moon.html |title=Hubble Shoots The Moon |editor-last=Stoyanova |editor-first=Silvia |date=September 10, 2007 |publisher=NASA |accessdate=October 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Space Agency]]'s [[SMART-1]] unmanned probe sent back photos of the landing sites, according to [[Bernard Foing]], Chief Scientist of the ESA Science Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.space.com/847-conspiracy-theories-spacecraft-snoops-apollo-moon-sites.html |title=End of Conspiracy Theories?

In 2002, Alex R. Blackwell of the [[University of Hawaii]] pointed out that some photos taken by Apollo astronauts&lt;ref name="apolloclempix" /&gt; while in orbit around the Moon show the landing sites.

''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' published a story in 2002 saying that European astronomers at the [[Very Large Telescope]] (VLT) would use it to view the landing sites. According to the article, Dr. [[Richard Martin West|Richard West]] said that his team would take "a high-resolution image of one of the Apollo landing sites." Marcus Allen, a conspiracist, answered that no photos of hardware on the Moon would convince him that manned landings had happened.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/1414144/Worlds-biggest-telescope-to-prove-Americans-really-walked-on-Moon.html |accessdate=August 26, 2009| title=World's biggest telescope to prove Americans really walked on Moon| date=November 24, 2002| first=Robert| last=Matthews| newspaper=The Daily Telegraph | location = London}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the VLT is capable of resolving equivalent to the distance between the headlights of a car as seen from the Moon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |last=Stee |first=Philippe |title=To Be or Not to Be: Is It All About Spinning? |date=September 20, 2006 |publisher=[[European Southern Observatory]] |location=Garching, Germany |url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso0635/ |accessdate=September 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; it may be able to photograph some features of the landing sites.

The [[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency]] (JAXA) launched their [[SELENE]] Moon orbiter on September 14, 2007 (JST), from [[Tanegashima Space Center]]. SELENE orbited the Moon at about {{convert|100|km}} altitude.

The Apollo program collected {{convert|838|lb|kg|order=flip}} of [[Moon rock]]s during the six manned missions.

Conspiracists argue that [[Marshall Space Flight Center#Directors|Marshall Space Flight Center Director]] [[Wernher von Braun]]'s trip to [[Antarctica]] in 1967 (about two years before the Apollo 11 launch) was to gather [[lunar meteorite]]s to be used as fake Moon rocks.

NASA said that von Braun's mission was "to look into environmental and logistic factors that might relate to the planning of future space missions, and hardware."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://history.msfc.nasa.gov/yy/y1967.html | title = Marshall Highlights for 1967 | publisher =[[Marshall Space Flight Center]] History Office}} Originally "published in a news release issued in late 1967 by the Marshall Center Public Affairs Office."&lt;/ref&gt; NASA continues to send teams to work in Antarctica to mimic the conditions on other planets.

On the makeup of the Moon rocks, Kaysing asked: "Why was there never a mention of gold, silver, diamonds or other precious metals on the moon? Wasn't this a viable consideration? Why was this fact never discussed [''sic''] in the press or by the astronauts?"&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kaysing|Kaysing 2002]], p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Geologists realize that gold and silver deposits on Earth are the result of the action of hydrothermal fluids concentrating the precious metals into veins of ore. Since in 1969 water was believed to be absent on the Moon, no geologist would bother discussing the possibility of finding these on the Moon in any great amount.

{{Main|Third-party evidence for Apollo Moon landings#Apollo missions tracked by independent parties|l1=Apollo missions tracked by independent parties}}
Aside from NASA, a number of groups and individuals tracked the Apollo missions as they happened. On later missions, NASA released information to the public explaining where and when the spacecraft could be sighted. Their flight paths were tracked using radar and they were sighted and photographed using telescopes. Also, radio transmissions between the astronauts on the surface and in orbit were independently recorded.

There are subcultures worldwide which advocate the belief that the Moon landings were faked. By 1977 the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]] magazine ''[[Back to Godhead]]'' called the landings a hoax, claiming that, since the [[Sun]] is 93,000,000 miles away, and "according to [[Hindu mythology]] the Moon is 800,000 miles farther away than that", the Moon would be nearly 94,000,000 miles away; to travel that span in 91 hours would require a speed of more than a million miles per hour, "a patently impossible feat even by the scientists' calculations."&lt;ref name="Goswami"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Satsvarūpa dāsa Goswami |authorlink=Satsvarupa dasa Goswami |date=May 1977 |title=Man on the Moon: A Case of Mass Brainwashing |url=http://back2godhead.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/123_1977_12-05.pdf |format=PDF |journal=[[Back to Godhead]] |location=Los Angeles |publisher=[[Bhaktivedanta Book Trust]] |volume=12 |issue=5 |pages=10–11, 13–14 |issn=0005-3643 |accessdate=October 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Scheaffer|Scheaffer 2011]], p. 229&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Oberg]] of [[ABC News]] said that the conspiracy theory is taught in [[Cuba]]n schools and wherever Cuban teachers are sent.&lt;ref name="Fake Moon Flight' Myth 2003, pp. 23, 30" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Getting Apollo 11 Right |first=James |last=Oberg |authorlink=James Oberg |url=http://abcnews.go.com/ABC2000/abc2000science/oberg2000.html |accessdate=August 13, 2009 |work=ABC News |publisher=ABC |location=New York |date=July 1999|quote=I'm told that this is official dogma still taught in schools in Cuba, plus wherever else Cuban teachers have been sent (such as [[Sandinista]] Nicaragua and Angola). |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030402094521/http://abcnews.go.com/ABC2000/abc2000science/oberg2000.html |archivedate=April 2, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; A poll conducted in the 1970s by the [[United States Information Agency]] in several countries in [[Latin America]], [[Asia]], and [[Africa]] found that most respondents were unaware of the Moon landings, many of the others dismissed them as [[propaganda]] or [[science fiction]], and many thought that it had been the [[Russia]]ns that landed on the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Oberg|Oberg 1982]], p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Alpine valley.jpg|thumb|right|Alpine valley, like Oldest Dryas]]
The '''Oldest Dryas''' was a climatic period, which occurred during the coldest [[stadial]] after the [[Weichselian]] glaciation in north Europe. In the [[Alps]], the Oldest Dryas corresponds to the [[Gschnitz]] stadial of the [[Würm glaciation]]. The three “Dryas” periods (younger, older, oldest) are named for a marker species, ''[[Dryas octopetala]]'', detected in [[core sample]]s of glacial ice and [[peat bog]]s. The Oldest Dryas corresponds to [[pollen zone]] Ia.

==Dating==
[[Image:Greenland Kangerlussuaq icesheet.jpg|thumb|right|The edge of the ice in Greenland]]
The period was between 16,050-13,050 [[Before Christ|BC]], from Roberts, 1998. A date from [[Kilkeel]], [[Northern Ireland]], extends the start of the period to as early as 17,050 BC. A strong sequence of carbon-14 dates derived from layered material in the Hauterive/Rouges-Terres excavations on the northwest shore of [[Lake Neuchâtel]] in [[Switzerland]], 1992–1993, places the end of the Oldest Dryas at about 12,700 BC, calibrated. The same date from [[Antarctica]] and the south China sea is 14,600 and 14,700, respectively, and a [[Greenland]] ice core indicates 14,500. David Miles refers to the Oldest Dryas as the last [[Heinrich event]] (H1) and dates it to between 16,500 and 14,500 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=David  |last=Miles  |title=The Tale of the Axe: How the Neolithic Revolution Transformed Britain |authorlink= |publisher= Thames &amp; Hudson|location = London, UK |year=2016 |page=79 |isbn=978-0-500-05186-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ultimate standard to which all these dates are to be compared is the graph of the [[oxygen isotope ratio cycle]]s, which gives change in isotope concentration on the y-axis, with time on the x-axis. The graph plots many events that are sharply defined, but others are not. The selection of a terminal point is sometimes partially arbitrary.

The end of the Oldest Dryas is sharply defined. The beginning is a long, gently sloping band, probably no earlier than 17,050 BC, but the date might be set later by approximately 1000 years. Data derived from isotope variation of [[nitrogen]] and [[argon]] trapped in [[Greenland]] ice gives a high-resolution date for the end of the oldest Dryas at the sharp temperature rise of 14.67 ky BP.

[[Image:Lac de Neuchatel depuis la Neuchatel (ville suisse) dscn0660.jpg|thumb|left|Lake Neuchatel]]
The complete sequence of late [[Pleistocene]] climatic periods, defined for [[Northern Europe]], are the Oldest Dryas (stadial), the [[Bølling Oscillation|Bölling]] (interstadial), the [[Older Dryas]] (stadial), the [[Allerød Oscillation|Allerød]] (interstadial), and the [[Younger Dryas]] (stadial). The [[Holocene]] begins immediately afterward. The last three are also [[Blytt-Sernander]] periods.

Sometimes, the Older Dryas is missing, as in the [[Jura Mountains]] of [[France]], or it is negligible in the evidence. In that case, the initial part of the sequence appears to be Oldest Dryas (cold), Bølling-Allerød (warm), Younger Dryas (cold). The Bølling-Allerød corresponds to the [[Windermere]] interstadial in [[Great Britain|Britain]].

Often, however, the apparently-missing Older Dryas is a problem of resolution in the evidence. Some scientists have undertaken high-resolution studies, which combine a variety of climatological methods. They, like the ones conducted on [[Owens Lake|Owens]] and [[Mono Lake|Mono]] Lakes, in [[California]], usually detect the Older Dryas. Even when it is detected, it appears to be no more than a few centuries of slightly-cooler weather on the oxygen isotope ratio graph.

==Flora==
During the Oldest Dryas, Europe was treeless and similar to the Arctic [[tundra]], but much drier and grassier than the modern tundra. It contained shrubs and herbaceous plants such as the following:
:*[[Poaceae]], grasses
:*''[[Artemisia (plant)|Artemisia]]''
:*''[[Dwarf Birch|Betula nana]]'', dwarf birch
:*''[[Dwarf Willow|Salix retusa]]'', dwarf willow
:*''[[Dryas octopetala]]''
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Grasslands-menggu.jpg|Grassland ([[Inner Mongolia]])
Image:Artemisia_vulgaris_-_Köhler–s_Medizinal-Pflanzen-016.jpg|''Artemisia vulgaris''
Image:Betula nana0.jpg|''Betula nana''
Image:Mountainavens2.jpg|''Dryas octopetala''
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Fauna==
Species were mainly Arctic but during the Glacial Maximum, the warmer weather species had withdrawn into refugia and began to repopulate Europe in the Oldest Dryas.

The brown bear, ''[[Brown bear|Ursos arctos]]'', was among the first to arrive in the north. Genetic studies indicate North European brown bears came from a refugium in the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]] of [[Moldavia]]. Other refugia were in [[Italy]], [[Spain]] and [[Greece]].

The bears would not have returned north except in pursuit of food. The tundra must already have been well populated. It is likely that the species hunted by humans at [[Lake Neuchâtel]] in [[Switzerland]] by the end of the period were present during it. Here are other animals present:

[[Aves]]
:*''[[Black-throated diver|Gavia arctica]]'', black-throated diver
:*''[[Black-necked grebe|Podiceps nigricollis]]'', black-necked grebe
:*''[[Whooper swan|Cygnus cygnus]]'', whooper swan
:*''[[Golden eagle|Aquila chrysaetos]]'', golden eagle
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Gavia arctica1.jpg|''Gavia arctica''
Image:Podiceps nigricollis naumann.jpg|''Podiceps nigricollis''
Image:Cygnus cygnus from zh.JPG|''Cygnus cygnus''
Image:Aquila chrysaetos large drawing.jpg|''Aquila chrysaetos''
&lt;/gallery&gt;
The above birds are primarily maritime. They must have fed in the copious glacial waters of the north that were just beginning to be released.

[[Fish]]
:*''[[Burbot|Lota lota]]'', burbot
:*''[[Grayling (species)|Thymallus thymallus]]'', grayling
:*''[[Common Roach|Rutilus rutilus]]'', roach
:*''[[Trout|Salmo trutta]]'', trout
:*''[[Salvelinus]] alpinus'', char
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Tarfala.jpg|Glacial stream
Image:Trüsche Walchensee.jpg|''Lota lota''
Image:Bachforelle Zeichnung.jpg|''Salmo trutta''
Image:Röding, Iduns kokbok.jpg|''Salvelinus''
&lt;/gallery&gt;

The smaller mammals of the food chain inhabited the herbaceous blanket of the tundra:

[[Cricetidae]]
:*''[[Lemming|Discrotonyx torquatus]]'', collared lemming
:*''[[Vole|Microtus oeconomus]]'', root vole
:*''[[Vole|Microtus arvalis]]'', common vole
:*''[[Vole|Chionmys nivalis]]'', snowy vole

[[Leporidae]]
:*''[[Mountain hare|Lepus timidus]]'', Arctic hare

[[Sciuridae]]
:*''[[Marmot|Marmota marmota]]'', marmot

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:TundraVole23.jpg|''Microtus oeconomus''
Image:Feldmaus Microtus arvalis.jpg|''Microtus arvalis''
Image:Arctic Hare.jpg|''Lepus timidus''
Image:Marmota marmota Alpes1.jpg|''Marmota marmota''
&lt;/gallery&gt;

In addition to bears and birds were other predators of the following small animals:

[[Carnivora]]
:*''[[Lynx|Felis lynx]]'', lynx
:*''[[Arctic fox|Alopex lagopus]]'', Arctic fox
:*''[[Wolf|Canis lupus]]'', wolf

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Lynx lynx poing.jpg|Lynx (or Felis) lynx
Image:Alopex lagopus standing on Nizke Island.jpg|''Alopex lagopus''
Image:Canis lupus portrait.jpg|''Canis lupus''
Image:IcelandicHorseInWinter.jpg|Icelandic horse, perhaps like ''Equus ferus''
&lt;/gallery&gt;
Humans were interested in the large mammals, which included:
:*''[[Reindeer|Rangifer tarandus]]'', reindeer
:*''[[Horse|Equus ferus]]'', wild horse
:*''[[Ibex|Capra ibex]]'', ibex

At some point, the larger mammals arrived: [[hyena]], [[woolly rhinoceros]], [[cave bear]] and [[mammoth]].
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Albino raindeer.jpg|Rangifer tarandus
Image:CapraIbex-1.jpg|Capra ibex
Image:Wooly rhinoceros.jpg|Woolly rhinoceros
Image:Mammouth.png|Mammoth
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Human prehistory==
[[Image:JomonPottery.JPG|thumb|right|Jōmon pottery]]
Human cultures in Europe were Upper [[Palaeolithic]] and belonged to [[Cro-Magnon]] man. [[Neanderthal]]s had long since disappeared by replacement or amalgamation with ''[[Homo sapiens]]''. The [[Magdalenian]] culture of reindeer hunters prevailed in Western Europe. From the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]] eastward, the Epigravettian continued the prior [[Gravettian]]. In Japan, the [[Jōmon]] culture had already become sedentary and was producing some food, and possibly grew rice, but it was not at all urban. It was manufacturing the first known pottery.

One of the most remarkable discoveries of the period was the domestic wolf, a distinct breed of ''[[Canis lupus]]'', with smaller teeth. The domestic dog, ''[[Canis familiaris]]'', also has been found. It is thought that the animals helped with the hunting, but they would, by the nature of the hunt, have gradually become adept at herding.

The '''Oral History Society''' promotes the collection, preservation and use of recorded memories of the past.

As well as offering practical advice and support, the Society aims to raise standards in [[oral history]] practices across a range of activities and disciplines.

Through an annual conference, other meetings, a web site and the ''Oral History'' journal the Society encourages individuals to share ideas, experience and good practice.

The Society also provides a voice for oral historians advising and collaborating with national organisations and research councils on oral history

==Origins and history==
The British-based organisation was founded in 1973, with its origins in an informal day conference at the British Institute of Recorded Sound (BIRS) in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;George Ewart Evans, Thea Thompson, Tony Green, Theo Barker and Patrick Saul, ‘The Leicester Conference on the problems of Oral History',  ''Oral History'', Vol. 1, No. 3 (1972), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early years support for the Society was drawn from amongst labour and social historians as well as archivists, folklorists, ethnographers and researchers in oral tradition (including the [[School of Scottish Studies]]). By the second half of the 1970s the Society also included feminist historians and others interested in women's history. The ''Oral History'' journal, founded by [[Paul Thompson (oral historian)|Paul Thompson]], has echoed these interests and many more in the articles it has published. Often featuring oral histories of individuals or groups who have been under-represented in historical accounts, from the first edition ''Oral History'' has also provided a forum for oral historians to discuss the methods and challenges involved in the collection, interpretation and dissemination of oral testimonies.

The journal has long maintained a news section that includes reports from community projects as well as a reviews section. This reflects the Society's policy of representing oral historians no matter where they work whether it is in education, community organisations or the media.

==Current activities==
Current activities include providing more than 300 training places each year; supporting over 40 experienced oral historians as locally based Regional Networkers - a point of contact for anyone interested in oral history; offering technical, legal and ethical advice; providing information on the funding of oral history work; and publishing two editions of ''Oral History'' each year. Members also receive a free e-newsletter several times a year with briefings and news items.

==Governance and structures==
A Committee of Trustees meets four times a year. Trustees are responsible for the governance of the Society and are elected at the Society's Annual General Meeting which is held at the Society's annual conference. Officers' positions of the Society include a Chair, Vice-Chair, Secretary and Treasurer who are also elected annually.

A key structure of the Society is the Regional Network consisting of oral historians who offer a first point of contact in localities throughout Britain and Northern Ireland. The Trustees' sub-committees reflect the priority areas and include a Nominations Committee, Higher Education Group, Trainers Group and an Archives Sub-Committee. The journal has its own Editorial Committee.

[[File:Map athenian empire 431 BC-en.svg|thumb|300px|The [[Delian League]] before the outbreak of the [[Peloponnesian War]] in 431 BC.]]
'''''Pentecontaetia''''' ({{lang-el|πεντηκονταετία}}, "the period of fifty years") is the term used to refer to the period in [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] history between the defeat of the [[second Persian invasion of Greece]] at [[Battle of Plataea|Plataea]] in 479 BC and the beginning of the [[Peloponnesian War]] in 431 BC. The term originated with a scholiast on [[Thucydides]], who used it in their description of the period. The ''Pentecontaetia'' was marked by the rise of [[Classical Athens|Athens]] as the dominant state in the Greek world and by the rise of [[Athenian democracy]]. Since Thucydides focused his account on these developments, the term is generally used when discussing developments in and involving Athens.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Ehrenberg and P.J. Rhodes, "Pentecontaetia," from ''The Oxford Classical Dictionary'', Simon Hornblower and Antony Spawforth, ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the Greek victory of 479 BC, Athens assumed the leadership of the [[Delian League]], a coalition of states that wished to continue the war against Persia. This league experienced a [[Wars of the Delian League|number of successes]] and was soon established as the dominant military force of the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]].  Athenian control over the league grew as some "allies" were reduced to the status of tribute-paying subjects and by the middle of the 5th century BC (the league treasury was moved from [[Delos]] to Athens in 454 BC) the league had been transformed into an Athenian empire.  Athens benefited greatly from this tribute, undergoing a [[Fifth Century Athens|cultural renaissance]] and undertaking massive public building projects, including the [[Parthenon]]; Athenian democracy, meanwhile, developed into what is today called radical or [[Periclean democracy]], in which the popular [[Ecclesia (ancient Athens)|assembly of the citizens]] and the large, citizen juries exercised near-complete control over the state.

The later years of the ''Pentecontaetia'' were marked by increasing conflict between Athens and the traditional land powers of Greece, led by [[Sparta]]. Between 460 BC and 445 BC, Athens fought a shifting coalition of mainland powers in what is now known as the [[First Peloponnesian War]]. During the course of this conflict, Athens gained and then lost control of large areas of [[central Greece]].  The conflict was concluded by the [[Thirty Years' Peace]], which lasted until the end of the ''Pentecontaetia'' and the beginning of the Peloponnesian War.

The eventual breakdown of the peace was triggered by increasing conflict between Athens and several of Sparta's allies. Athens' alliance with [[Corcyra]] and attack on [[Potidaea]] enraged [[Corinth]], and the [[Megarian decree]] imposed strict economic sanctions on Megara, another Spartan ally.  These disputes, along with a general perception that Athenian power had grown too powerful, led to the breakdown of the Thirty Years Peace; the Peloponnesian War broke out in 431 BC.

== Timeline of the Pentecontaetia (480—431) ==
'''479'''—Rebuilding of Athens: Although the Greeks were victorious in the Persian War, many Greeks believed that the Persians would retaliate. This led Athens to rebuild its long walls that were razed by the Persian Army during the occupation of [[Attica]] in 480.

'''478'''—Formation of the Delian League: Athens and other city states form a coalition against Persia.

'''477'''—The Conquest of Eion: [[Cimon]], the son of Miltiades of Marathon fame, led Athens to numerous victorious campaigns and war profits. In 477, he led an army against Persian-occupied Eion in northern Greece. Athens was able to benefit from this invasion since the region was rich in timber, which was critical to building Athens' burgeoning naval fleet.

'''476'''—The Conquest of Scyros: The invasions continued with success on a par with Cimon's prior campaigns. In 476, Athens fought against the pirates of Scyros, as the Delian League wanted to reduce piracy around the region and capture the important materials for itself.

'''469'''—Operation in Asia Minor and the Battle of Eurymedon: From the beginning of 469 to 466, the Delian league led an army to [[Asia Minor]] against Persia. Cimon persuaded Greek settlements on the Carian and Lycian coast to rebel against Persia. This led the Persian army to mobilize a force to fight Cimon in the [[Battle of Eurymedon]] in [[Pamphylsia]]. Cimon was able to swiftly defeat the Persian army and the war profits were used to finance Athens' city walls.

'''465'''—Operations in Northern Greece: Athens' powers and desire for expansion grow. In 465, after [[Cleruchy|cleruchizing]] the Chersonese, they tried to gain control of [[Thasos]]. Thucydides wrote that Sparta contemplated an invasion of Attica in order to help free Thasos. However, in the aftermath of a catastrophic earthquake and subsequent helot uprising in Sparta, no attack—if indeed such was projected—was launched.

'''461'''—The Debate in Athens over Helping Sparta: With a legion of [[Helot]]s rebelling against Sparta, Athens offered Sparta their help by sending a force of 4,000 [[Hoplite]]s to suppress the rebels. According to Thucydides, Sparta decided to dismiss Cimon's Athenian Army, because they felt that Athens would convince the Helots on [[Ithome]] to form a coalition and besiege Sparta. Spartans did not feel comfortable with such a large Athenian force inside their city. If the Athenians were to turn their backs on Sparta, the city would not be able to protect itself. At this point, Sparta acknowledged that Athens might be getting too powerful. According to Thucydides, the Athenians were deeply offended by their removal from Ithome. They denounced their original treaty with Sparta made during the Greco-Persian Wars, then proceeded to make an alliance with [[Argos]], a major enemy of the Spartans. 

'''460'''—Athens' Clash with Corinth over Megara: Megarians joined the Delian League due to a war between Megara and Corinth. This angered the Corinthians. Even using Athens' weakest soldiers, being the old and young men who were left behind in the city, they were able to win the war against Corinth with ease.

'''460'''—The Athenian Expedition to Egypt: Athens led a coalition with the Egyptians to rebel against Persia. However, their six-year expedition did not lead to much success against Persia, as 100 Athenian ships were destroyed in the Delta region.

'''458'''—The Long Walls: The construction of the long walls gave Athens a major military advantage by forming a barrier around the city-state and its harbors, which allowed their ships to access waterways without threat from outside forces. Two walls were constructed from the city to the sea, one to [[Phaleron]] and the other to [[Piraeus]]. Athens relied on these long walls to protect itself from invasion, while sending off its superior vessels to bombard opponents' cities.

'''458'''—The Battle of Tanagra: According to Thucydides, Spartans aided the Dorians by invading Greece, because they were motivated by ethnic solidarity. Sparta sent out 1500 Hoplites and an additional 10,000 from their allies' forces to suppress the Phocians' Army invading Doris. The Spartans were victorious, but they found themselves stuck in this foreign land. Athens, suspecting a plot by the Spartans to overthrow the democracy and to prevent the building of the Long Walls, then attacked the Spartans at Tanagra in [[Boeotia]] with a force of 14,000. The Spartans were victorious in this battle.

'''457'''—The Battle of Oenophyta: After the Spartans returned home from Tanagra, the Athenians conquered Boetia and [[Phocis]] after a battle at [[Oenophyta]]. They then proceeded to tear down Tanagra's fortifications. 

'''450'''—The Peace of Callias—Although this peace treaty is subject to scholarly debate, allegedly Athens and Persia agreed to a ceasefire.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Peace of Callias {{!}} ancient Greece-Persia [450 449 BC]|url = http://www.britannica.com/topic/Peace-of-Callias|website = Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date = 2016-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''447'''—Athens' forces were defeated at Coronea, causing the Athenian army to flee [[Boeotia]].

'''446'''—The Peloponnesian Invasion of Attica: Athens continued their indirect war with Sparta by attempting to gain control of Delphi. City-states such as Megara and Euboea began to rebel against Athens and the Delian League when the Spartan Army invaded Athenian territory.

'''445'''—The Thirty-Year Peace Between Athens and Sparta: After losing Attica, Boeotia and Megara, Athens agreed to a thirty-year peace in return for all the conquered areas in the Peloponnesian region. From this point on, all future conflicts between Athens and Sparta were resolved under arbitration.

'''447'''—Athenian Colonization and the Colony of Brea: With the 30-year peace treaty, Athens was able to concentrate attention towards growth rather than war. From 447-445, the Delian League was able to influence city-states near the Mediterranean to join and pay tribute (phoro). This helped the region because the tributes paid by each and every city-state were reduced with the increasing number of members joining the league.

'''441'''—The Samian Revolt—Athens decided to besiege [[Samos]] after their revolt in 441. However, Persia decided to take the opportunity to support Samos even though they have signed the Peace of Callias with Athens. Athens would eventually spend 1200 talents to fund the war through the Delian League's treasury. Some scholars believed that Sparta might have aided Samos as well, but decided to pull out, having they signed the Thirty-year peace treaty.

'''437'''—The Foundation of Amphipolis: With vast resources, especially timber for ship building, Athens founded the city of [[Amphipolis]] on the Strymon River. Amphipolis was immensely important to Athens since it controlled many trading routes.

'''432'''—The Potidaean Affair: Athens was threatened by the possibility of a revolt, plotted by Corinth and [[Macedon]]. After fighting in Macedon, which ended when the two countries came to terms with each other, Athens came to Potidaea. They had previously demanded that Potidaea tear down their long walls and banish Corinth ambassadors. However, by the time Athens reached Potidaea, the residents were in full revolt and prepared to fight Athens with support from the Corinthian army. The Corinthians was also able to influence the Spartans to join the cause, since Sparta didn't want to lose such an affluent ally. The fighting concluded with an Athenian victory. 

'''432'''—The Megarian Decree: With Sparta's aid, Megara urged Athens to drop their decree against them since it was hurting their economy; they were forbidden to use Athen's markets and harbors. Athens claims that Megarians insulted them by trespassing on land sacred to [[Demeter]] and murdering an Athenian ambassador. However, most scholars believe it was an act of vengeance when Megara revolted during the early parts of the Pentecontaetia.

'''432'''—Peloponnesian War—This marked the end of the Pentecontaetia, as Athens and Sparta engaged in all-out war, which eventually led to the demise of the Athenian Empire.

=== Democracy in Athens during the Pentecontaetia ===
After the exile of Cimon in Athens, his rivals [[Ephialtes]] and Pericles implemented democratic social reforms. In 462, Ephialtes challenged the [[Areopagus]], claiming that they were abusing their powers. Part of the reform was to introduce "[[graphe paranomon]]" or public protest against illegal decrees. Any citizen would have the right to challenge a previous degree instilled by the Areopagus and claim it as invalid. The assembly would have to conduct a "dokimasia" or examination of state officials before they enter office. Opportunities for citizens to join the office were increased tremendously when 500 members were added. Transferring the powers of the Areopagus to all Athenian citizens enabled a more democratic society. 

These democratic ideals are reflected in the use of personal names without a [[Patronymic]] on inscriptions of casualty lists from around this time, such as those of the tribe [[Erechtheis]] dated to 460/459BC &lt;ref&gt;Robin Osborne and P. J. Rhodes. ''Greek Historical Inscriptions 478-404 BC'' Oxford 2017 no. 109&lt;/ref&gt; and the Argive dead at the [[Battle of Tanagra (457 BC)]].&lt;ref&gt;Robin Osborne and P. J. Rhodes. ''Greek Historical Inscriptions 478-404 BC'' Oxford 2017 no. 111&lt;/ref&gt;. Without the [[Patronymic]] or demotic it would have been impossible to identify the particular individual being referred to when multiplicity of the same name occurred, thus both reducing the impact of the long list and ensuring that individuals are deprived of their social context.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Osborne and P. J. Rhodes. ''Greek Historical Inscriptions 478-404 BC'' Oxford 2017 p 61&lt;/ref&gt;

After Ephialtes death, his younger partner Pericles continued with reforms, transforming Athens into the most democratic city-state of Ancient Greece. During 450, he implemented a state salary of two obols per day for jurors to increase public participation from citizens. However, this system caused an outrage from the elites, claiming that the poor were uneducated and incapable of governing.

=== Increasing Tensions Leading to War ===
[[Thucydides]] offers us a unique perspective to view the [[Peloponnesian War]] since he actually took part in the conflict. This first-hand experience allows a look into the mind of a person at the center of the ordeal. The conflict between Athens and Sparta is in Thucydides’ eyes an inevitable confrontation of the two major powers. The beginning of this tension begins during the incipient stages of the Athenian empire following the defeat of Persia during a period called the “pentekontaetia”. The pentekontaetia began in 479 and ended with the outbreak of war. With great confidence in their military abilities, perhaps a bit of instilled machoism, and the need for an anti-Persian alliance, Athens begins recruiting various Greek city-states into an alliance called the [[Delian League]]. The growth of Athenian power through the [[Delian League]] is centered on a growing navy, the rebuilding of the walls that protect the city from land-based attackers, and an aggressive push to extend their influence which included a few skirmishes with other powers. [[Thucydides]] writes about how this period of growth was an inevitable cause of war, “Their supremacy grew during the interval between the present war and the Persian wars, through their military and political actions recounted below against the barbarians, against their own allies in revolt, and against the Peloponnesians whom they encountered on various occasions.” (1.97 [2])

Athenian naval supremacy was a great fear of [[Sparta]] and her allies. While the Spartans combat prowess was unmatched on land, when it came to the sea [[Athens]] was the clear victor. This split seemed to have already been accepted by the Spartans many years earlier, however the aggressiveness and effectiveness of Athenian naval warfare had yet to be fully realized. According to [[Thucydides]] following the defeat of [[Persia]], Athens begins to reconstruct the long walls which connected the main city of Athens to the port of [[Piraeus]] around 478.  “Spartan feeling was at that time very friendly towards [[Athens]] on account of the patriotism which she had displayed in the struggle with Mede. Still the defeat of their wishes could not but cause them secret annoyance.” (1.92 [1]) The Spartan annoyance stems partly from the long walls being a major deterrent to land based, non-siege tactics which the Spartans were particularly adept at, but also from the way in which the deal was brokered.

[[Thucydides]] writes of [[Themistocles]], an envoy to [[Sparta]], who in 479 changed the tide of history by hiding the facts regarding the construction of the walls around [[Athens]] and those of the [[Piraeus]]. In Themistocles’speech to the Spartan assembly Thucydides points out that at this point Athenian independence was highlighted. “Wherever they had deliberated with the Spartans, they had proved themselves to be in judgment second to none.” (1.91 [5]) This is an important step because Themistocles articulates that Athens is an independent state with its own agenda that brushed over that of others. This is a very important point in the lead up to the [[Peloponnesian War]] because one man is credited with making the split. [[Themistocles]] through his cunningness asserts an independent and strong Athenian identity. He makes it clear after the walls have been secured (ensuring Athenian strength) that Athens is independent and is making self-interested decisions. Furthermore, [[Themistocles]] also predicts that the growth in Athenian power will be centered on the sea. “For he first ventured to tell them to stick to the sea and forthwith began to lay the foundations of the empire.” (1.93 [5]) [[Thucydides]] credits [[Themistocles]] with the determining point in which Athens becomes an empire creating the divide between [[Sparta]] and [[Athens]].

In [[sociology]], the '''post-industrial society''' is the stage of society's development when the [[tertiary sector of the economy|service sector]] generates more wealth than the [[secondary sector of the economy|manufacturing sector]] of the economy.

The term was originated by [[Alain Touraine]] and is closely related to similar sociological theoretical constructs such as [[post-Fordism]], [[information society]], [[knowledge economy]], [[post-industrial economy]], [[late modernity|liquid modernity]], and [[network society]]. They all can be used in economics or social science disciplines as a general theoretical backdrop in [[research design]].

As the term has been used, a few common themes, including the ones below have begun to emerge.

# The economy undergoes a transition from the production of goods to the provision of services.
# Knowledge becomes a valued form of capital; see [[Human capital]].
# Producing ideas is the main way to grow the economy.
# Through processes of globalization and automation, the value and importance to the economy of [[Blue-collar worker|blue-collar]], unionized work, including manual labor (e.g., assembly-line work) decline, and those of professional workers (e.g., scientists, creative-industry professionals, and IT professionals) grow in value and prevalence.
# Behavioral and information sciences and technologies are developed and implemented. (e.g., [[behavioral economics]], [[information architecture]], [[cybernetics]], [[game theory]] and [[information theory]].)

==Origins==
[[Daniel Bell]] popularized the term through his 1974 work ''The Coming of Post-Industrial Society''.&lt;ref name="Bell, Daniel 1974"&gt;Bell, Daniel. The Coming of Post-Industrial Society. New York: Harper Colophon Books, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; Although some have credited Bell with coining the term,&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.economist.com/node/18061086?story_id=18061086 Ahead of the curve]'', Schumpeter, [[The Economist]], Feb 3rd 2011&lt;/ref&gt; French sociologist [[Alain Touraine]] published in 1969 the first major work on the post-industrial society. The term was also used extensively by social philosopher [[Ivan Illich]] in his 1973 paper ''[[Tools for Conviviality]]'' and appears occasionally in Leftist texts throughout the mid-to-late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;For example, James Weinstein, 'Studies on the Left: R.I.P.', ''Radical America: An SDS Magazine'', vol.1, no.3 (Nov-Dec, 1967), p.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term has grown and changed as it became mainstream. The term is now used by admen such as [[Seth Godin]],&lt;ref&gt;Godin, Seth . ''Linchpin'' (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; public policy PhD's such as Keith Boeckelman,&lt;ref&gt;The American States in the Postindustrial Economy. The State and Local Government Review. on the web: https://www.jstor.org/pss/4355128&lt;/ref&gt; and sociologists such as [[Neil Fligstein]] and Ofer Sharone.&lt;ref&gt;Work in the Postindustrial Economy of California. (2002) On the web http://www.russellsage.org/publications/workingpapers/workpostindcalif/document&lt;/ref&gt; Former U.S. President Bill Clinton even used the term to describe Chinese growth in a round-table discussion in Shanghai in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;1999 Forward to "The Coming of the Post-Industrial Society" by Daniel Bell&lt;/ref&gt;

==Valuation of knowledge==
The post-industrialized society is marked by an increased valuation of knowledge. This itself is unsurprising, having been foreshadowed in [[Daniel Bell]]'s presumption as to how economic employment patterns will evolve in such societies. He asserts employment will grow faster in the tertiary (and quaternary) sector relative to employment in the primary and secondary sector and that the tertiary (and quaternary) sectors will take precedence in the economy. This will continue to occur such that the“impact of the expert”will expand and power will be monopolized by knowledge.&lt;ref name="Targ, Harry R 1976"&gt;Targ, Harry R. "Global Dominance and Dependence, Post-Industrialism, and International Relations Theory: A Review." International Studies Quarterly. 20. 3 (1976): 461-482.&lt;/ref&gt;

As tertiary and quaternary sector positions are essentially knowledge-oriented, this will result in a restructuring of education, at least in its nuances.  The“new power… of the expert”consequently gives rise to the growing role of universities and research institutes in post-industrial societies.&lt;ref name="Targ, Harry R 1976"/&gt; Post-industrial societies themselves become oriented around these places of knowledge production and production of experts as their new foci. Consequently, the greatest beneficiaries in the post-industrial society are young urban professionals. As a new, educated, and politicized generation more impassioned by liberalism, social justice, and environmentalism the shift of power into their hands, as a result of their knowledge endowments, is often cited as a good thing.&lt;ref name="Wright, James D. 1978"&gt;Wright, James D.“The Political Consciousness of Post-Industrialism.” Contemporary Sociology. 7. 3 (1978): 270-273.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Banks 1983"&gt;Banks, Alan and Jim Foster.“The Mystifications of Post-Industrialism. Appalachian Journal . 10. 4 (1983): 372-378.&lt;/ref&gt;

The increasing importance of knowledge in post-industrial societies results in a general increase in expertise through the economy and throughout society. In this manner, it eliminates what Alan Banks and Jim Foster identify as “undesirable work as well as the grosser forms of poverty and inequality.” This effect is supplemented by the aforementioned movement of power into the hands of young educated people concerned with social justice.&lt;ref name="Banks 1983"/&gt;

Economists at Berkeley have studied the value of knowledge as a form of [[human capital|capital]], adding value to material capital, such as factory or a truck. Speaking along the same lines of their argument, the addition or 'production' of knowledge, could become the basis of what would undoubtably be considered 'post-industrial' policies meant to deliver economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;Czarnitzki, Dirk; Hall Bronwyn H. (Berkeley); Oriani Raffaele; ''The Market Valuation of Knowledge Assets in US and European Firms.'' On the web at http://elsa.berkeley.edu/~bhhall/papers/CHO05_mktval.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creativity culture==
Similarly, post-industrial society has serviced the creative culture. Many of those most well-equipped to thrive in an increasingly technological society are young adults with tertiary education. As education itself becomes more and more oriented towards producing people capable of answering the need for self-actualization, creativity, and self-expression, successive generations become more endowed with the ability to contribute to and perpetuate such industries. This nuanced change in education, as well among the emerging class of young professionals, is itself initiated by what James D Wright identifies as an “unprecedented economic affluence and the satiation of basic material needs.”&lt;ref name="Wright, James D. 1978"/&gt; [[Ellen Dunham-Jones]] as well observes this feature of post-industrial society where “abundant goods [are] equitably distributed [in order that] laborless leisure and self-determination” can be consumed.&lt;ref name="Dunham-Jones, Ellen 2000"&gt;Dunham-Jones, Ellen. “New Urbanism as a Counter-Project to Post-Industrialism [The Promise of New Urbanism].” Places. 13. 2 (2000): 26-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

The post-industrial society is repeatedly stressed to be one where knowledge is power and technology is the instrument.&lt;ref name="Targ, Harry R 1976"/&gt; Naturally, where one is creatively inclined, they are advantaged by such a society. The doctrine of “speed, mobility and malleability” is well suited to a dynamic creative industry and as industries of good production decrease in precedence, the way is paved for artists, musicians, and other such types, whose skills are better utilized by the tertiary and quaternary sector.&lt;ref name="Dunham-Jones, Ellen 2000"/&gt; Urban geographer Trevor Barnes, in his work outlining the Vancouver experience in post-war development, evokes the post-industrial condition, citing the emergence and consolidation of a significant video games industry as a constituent of the elite service sector.&lt;ref name="Barnes, T 2011"&gt;Barnes, T et al. “Vancouver: Restructuring narratives in the transnational metropolis.” Canadian urban regions: trajectories of growth and change. Eds. L Bourne et al. (2011): 291-327.&lt;/ref&gt;

This increased faculty of the post-industrialist society with respects to the creative industry is itself reflected by the economic history of post-industrial societies. As economic activities shift from primarily primary and secondary sector-based to tertiary, and later quaternary, sector-based, cities in which this shift occurs become more open to exchanges of information.&lt;ref name="Golden, Miriam 2006"&gt;Golden, Miriam &amp; Michael Wallerstein. “Domestic and International Causes for the Rise of Pay Inequality: Post-Industrialism, Globalization and Labor Market Institutions.” The Institute for Research on Labor and Employment, UCLA (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; This is necessitated by the demands of a tertiary and quaternary sector: in order to better service an industry focused on finance, education, communication, management, training, engineering, and aesthetic design, the city must become points of exchange capable of providing the most updated information from across the globe. Conversely, as cities become a convergence of international ideas, the tertiary and quaternary sector can be expected to grow.&lt;ref name="Barnes, T 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Golden, Miriam 2006"/&gt;

A virtual cult of 'creatives' have sprung up embodying and often describing and defending the post-industrial ethos. They argue that businesses that create intangibles have taken a more prominent role in the wake of manufacturing's decline.

Actor and then-artistic director of the [[Old Vic Theatre]], [[Kevin Spacey]], has argued the economic case for the arts in terms of providing jobs and being of greater importance in exports than manufacturing (as well as an educational role) in a guest column he wrote for ''[[The Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article6251188.ece Kevin Spacey makes an economic case for the arts{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critics==
Post-industrialism is criticized for the amount of real fundamental change it produces in society, if any at all. A mild view held by Alan Banks and Jim Foster contends that representations of post-industrial society by advocates assume professional, educated [[elite|elites]] were previously less relevant than they have become in the new [[social order]], and that changes that have occurred are minor but greatly embellished.&lt;ref name="Banks 1983"/&gt; More critical views see the entire process as the highest evolution of [[capitalism]], wherein the system produces [[commodities]] as opposed to practical goods and is determined privately instead of socially. This view is complemented by the assertion that “the characteristic feature of a modern [that is, post-industrial] society is that it is a [[technocracy]].”&lt;ref name="Targ, Harry R 1976"/&gt; Such societies then become notable for their ability to subvert [[social consciousness]] through powers of [[Psychological manipulation|manipulation]] rather than powers of [[coercion]], reflective of the “ideology of the ruling class [as] … predominantly managerial.”&lt;ref name="Targ, Harry R 1976"/&gt;

In line with the view that nothing fundamental has changed in the transition from industrial societies to post-industrial societies is the insistence of lingering problems from past development periods. [[Neo-Malthusian]] in essence, this outlook focuses on post-industrial society’s continuing struggle with issues of resource [[scarcity]], [[overpopulation]], and [[environmental degradation]], all of which are remnants from its industrial history.&lt;ref name="Gibson, Donald E. 1993"&gt;Gibson, Donald E. “Post-Industrialism: Prosperity or Decline?” Sociological Focus. 26. 2 (1993): 147-163.&lt;/ref&gt; This is exacerbated by a “[[corporate liberalism]]” that seeks to continue [[economic growth]] through “the creation and satisfaction of [[false needs]],” or as [[Christopher Lasch]] more derisively refers to it, “subsidized waste.”&lt;ref name="Targ, Harry R 1976"/&gt;

[[Urban development]] in the context of post-industrialism is also a point of contention. In opposition to the view that the new leaders of post-industrial society are increasingly environmentally aware, this critique asserts that it rather leads to environmental degradation, this being rooted in the patterns of development. [[Urban sprawl]], characterised behaviourally by cities “expanding at the periphery in even lower densities” and physically by “[[office park|office parks]], [[Shopping mall|malls]], strips, condo clusters, corporate campuses and gated communities,” is singled out as the main issue.&lt;ref name="Dunham-Jones, Ellen 2000"/&gt; Resulting from a post-industrialist culture of “[[mobile capital]], the [[service economy]], post-Fordist disposable [[consumerism]] and [[banking deregulation]],” urban sprawl has caused post-industrialism to become environmentally and socially regressive.&lt;ref name="Dunham-Jones, Ellen 2000"/&gt; Of the former, environmental degradation results from encroachment as cities meet demands on low-density habitation; the wider spread of population consumes more of the environment while necessitating more energy consumption in order to facilitate travel within the ever-growing city, incurring greater pollution.&lt;ref name="Dunham-Jones, Ellen 2000"/&gt; This process evokes the neo-Malthusian concerns of overpopulation and resource scarcity that inevitably lead to environmental deterioration.&lt;ref name="Gibson, Donald E. 1993"/&gt; Of the latter, “post-industrialism’s doctrine of … mobility and malleability” encourage a disconnect between communities where social belonging falls into the category of things considered by the “post-Fordist disposable consumer[ist]” attitude as interchangeable, expendable, and replaceable.&lt;ref name="Dunham-Jones, Ellen 2000"/&gt;

Post-industrialism as a concept is highly [[western culture|Western]]-centric. Theoretically and effectively, it is only possible in the Global West, which its proponents assume to be solely capable of fully realizing industrialization and then post-industrialization. [[Herman Kahn]] optimistically predicted the “economic growth, expanded production and growing efficiency” of post-industrial societies and the resultant “material abundance and… high [[quality of life]]” to extend to “almost all people in Western societies” and only “some in Eastern societies.”&lt;ref name="Gibson, Donald E. 1993"/&gt; This prediction is treated elsewhere by contentions that the post-industrial society merely perpetuates capitalism.&lt;ref name="Targ, Harry R 1976"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dunham-Jones, Ellen 2000"/&gt;

Recalling the critical assertion that all modern societies are technocracies, [[Theodore Roszak (scholar)|T. Roszak]] completes the analysis by stating that “all societies are moving in the direction of technocracies.”&lt;ref name="Targ, Harry R 1976"/&gt; From this, the foremost “suave technocracies” reside in the West, whereas all others are successively graded in descending order: “vulgar technocracies,” “[[teratoid]] technocracies,” and finally “comic opera technocracies.”&lt;ref name="Targ, Harry R 1976"/&gt; This view importantly presumes one transition and furthermore one path of transition for societies to undergo, i.e. the one that Western societies are slated to complete. Much like the [[demographic transition]] model, this prediction does not entertain the idea of an Eastern or other alternative model of transitional development.

===Neologism===
When historians and sociologists considered the revolution that followed the agricultural society they did not call it a "post-agricultural society". "Post-industrial society" signifies only a departure, not a positive description.&lt;ref&gt;Veneris, Yannis. The Informational Revolution, Cybernetics and Urban Modelling, PhD Thesis, University of Newcastle upon Tyne, UK, 1984. This thesis explored trends and theories (general economic and regional), and developed a large scale dynamic simulation model of the transition from an industrial to an informational economy.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Veneris, Yannis. Modeling the transition from the Industrial to the Informational Revolution, Environment and Planning A 22(3):399-416, 1990. [http://www.envplan.com/abstract.cgi?id=a220399]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the word's early users, [[Ivan Illich]], prefigured this criticism and invented the term Conviviality, or the [[Convivial Society]], to stand as a positive description of his version of a post-industrial society.

===Social critique===
A group of scholars (including [[Allen J. Scott|Allen Scott]] and [[Edward Soja]]) argue that industry remains at the center of the whole process of capitalist accumulation, with services not only becoming increasingly industrialized and automated but also remaining highly dependent on industrial growth.

Some observers, including Soja (building on the theories of the French philosopher of urbanism [[Henri Lefebvre]]), suggest that although industry may be based outside of a "post-industrial" nation, that nation cannot ignore industry's necessary sociological importance.

The '''''Régence''''' ({{IPA-fr|ʁeʒɑ̃s}}, ''Regency'') was the period in [[History of France|French history]] between 1715 and 1723, when King [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] was a [[minor (law)|minor]] and the land was governed by '''[[Philippe II, Duke of Orléans|Philippe d'Orléans]]''', a nephew of [[Louis XIV of France]], as [[prince regent]].

Philippe was able to take power away from the [[Louis-Auguste de Bourbon, duc du Maine|Duke of Maine]] (illegitimate son of Louis XIV and [[Madame de Montespan]]) who had been the favourite son of the late king and possessed much influence. From 1715 to 1718 the ''[[Polysynody]]'' changed the system of government in France, in which each minister (secretary of state) was replaced by a council. The ''[[John Law (economist)|système de Law]]'' was also introduced, which transformed the finances of the bankrupted kingdom and its aristocracy. Both [[Guillaume Dubois|Cardinal Dubois]] and [[André-Hercule de Fleury|Cardinal Fleury]] were highly influential during this time.

Contemporary European rulers included [[Philip V of Spain]], [[John V of Portugal]], [[George I of Great Britain]], [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor]] and [[Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia]], the maternal grandfather of Louis XV.

==Chronology==

===1714===
*'''29 July 1714''': the [[Louis-Auguste de Bourbon, duc du Maine|Duke of Maine]] and the [[Louis-Alexandre de Bourbon, comte de Toulouse|Count of Toulouse]], Louis XIV's bastard sons, are made [[Prince du Sang|Princes of the Blood]].

===1715===
*'''1 September 1715''': Louis XIV dies, his will entrusts the government of France to a regency council, with  [[Philippe II, Duke of Orléans]] as an honorary president and the Duke of Maine as the real power, until his great-grandson and successor, the five year old [[Louis XV of France]], reaches his majority (13 years old) in 1723.
*'''2 September 1715''': the Duke of Orléans allies himself with the '''[[Parlement|Parlement de Paris]]''', who cancelled Louis XIV's will. As a Prince of the Blood, Philippe of Orléans had been a member of the Parlement.

===People===
'''''The Men'''''

*'''[[Philippe II, Duke of Orléans|Philippe d'Orléans]]''' (2 August 1674 – 2 December 1723) Born at his fathers Palace at Saint-Cloud, he was the Duke of Chartres from birth; his mother, whom he was very close to, was a German Princess of the Palatinate named [[Elizabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate|Elizabeth Charlotte]]. In 1692 he married his first cousin, [[Françoise-Marie de Bourbon]] – the youngest illegitimate daughter of Philippe's uncle [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] and [[Françoise-Athénaïs, marquise de Montespan|Madame de Montespan]]. He died at Versailles in the arms of his mistress;
*'''[[Louis Henri, Duke of Bourbon|Louis Henri de Bourbon, Duke of Bourbon]]''' (18 August 1692 – 27 January 1740) son of [[Louis III, Prince of Condé]] and [[Louise-Françoise de Bourbon]], he was thus the nephew of Philippe d'Orléans and was the Prime Minister of France 1723–26; he was a great rival of the Regent and the House of Orléans in general;
*'''[[Louis-Auguste de Bourbon, duc du Maine|Louis Auguste de Bourbon, ''Duke of Maine'']]''' (31 March 1670 – 14 May 1736) favourite but illegitimate son of Louis XIV and [[Françoise d'Aubigné, marquise de Maintenon|Madame de Maintenon]], he was despised by the Princes of the Blood due to his constant honours and great wealth he accumulated from his father. He died at Sceaux aged 66;
*'''[[John Law (economist)|John Law]]''' (pronounced ''Jean Lass'') (21 April 1671 – 21 March 1729) was a Scottish Economist who believed that money was only a means of exchange that did not constitute [[wealth]] in itself and that national wealth depended on trade. He was responsible for the [[Mississippi Scheme|Mississippi Bubble]] and a chaotic economic collapse in France; he died in [[Venice]].

'''''The Women'''''

*'''[[Infante|Infanta]] [[Mariana Victoria of Spain]]''' (31 March 1718 – 15 January 1781) was the eldest daughter of [[Philip V of Spain]] and his second wife [[Elisabeth of Parma]]; born in Madrid, she moved to France in 1721 and lived at the Tuileries Palace in Paris with her proposed husband; the engagement was broken off due to tense relations regarding the marriages of the Regents daughters to Philip V's sons. The [[Infante|Infanta]] was sent back to Spain and later married the future [[Joseph I of Portugal]]; the present [[Brazilian Imperial Family]] descend from Philippe d'Orléans, Louis XV as well as Mariana Victoria;
*'''[[Françoise Marie de Bourbon]]''' (4 May 1677 – 1 February 1749) was an [[Illegitimacy|illegitimate]] child of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] and [[Françoise-Athénaïs, marquise de Montespan|Madame de Montespan]].

*'''[[Anne Louise Bénédicte de Bourbon]]''' (8 November 1676 – 23 January 1753) was the wife of the Duke of Maine and thus daughter-in-law of Louis XIV; she was one of the Regents most ardent enemies and was the aunt of the [[Duke of Bourbon]]; she was also the granddaughter of the ''[[Louis II de Bourbon, Prince de Condé|Le Grand Condé]]''; she held court at Sceaux and was exiled to [[Dijon]] after the [[Cellamare Conspiracy]] was found out; she died in Paris having outlived most of her generation;

===Places===
*''[[Palace of Versailles]]'' : Birthplace of Louis XV and the home of the French court before and after the Regency; it was at Versailles that the Duke of Orléans died in 1723;
*''[[Palais-Royal]]'' : Paris home of the [[House of Orléans]]; it was from there that the Regent handled state affairs; his last daughter, Louise Diane, was also born at the palace;
*''[[Tuileries Palace|Palais des Tuileries]]'' : the childhood home of Louis XV during the Regency; Louis XV was installed in the ''Grand Appartements'' of Louis XIV located on the second floor.

===Politics===
The Régence marks the temporary eclipse of [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] as centre of policymaking, since the Regent's court was at the [[Palais Royal]] in Paris. It marks the rise of Parisian [[Salon (gathering)|salon]]s as cultural centres, as literary meeting places and nuclei of discreet liberal resistance to some official policies. In the Paris salons aristocrats mingled more easily with the ''higher [[Bourgeoisie]]'' in a new atmosphere of relaxed decorum, comfort and intimacy.

===Art history===
In the arts, the style of the Régence is marked by early [[Rococo]], characterised by the paintings of [[Antoine Watteau]] (1684–1721).

Rococo developed first in the decorative arts and interior design. Louis XIV's succession brought a change in the court artists and general artistic fashion. By the end of the old king's reign, rich Baroque designs were giving way to lighter elements with more curves and natural patterns. These elements are obvious in the architectural designs of [[Nicolas Pineau]].  During the Régence, court life moved away from Versailles and this artistic change became well established, first in the royal palace and then throughout French high society. The delicacy and playfulness of Rococo designs is often seen as perfectly in tune with the excesses of Louis XV's regime.

The 1730s represented the height of Rococo development in France. The style had spread beyond architecture and furniture to painting and sculpture, exemplified by the works of [[Antoine Watteau]] and [[François Boucher]]. Rococo still maintained the Baroque taste for complex forms and intricate patterns, but by this point, it had begun to integrate a variety of diverse characteristics, including a taste for Oriental designs and asymmetric compositions.

===Colonialism===
The ''Régence'' is also the customary French word for the pre-independence regimes in the western North African countries, the so-called [[Barbary Coast]]. It was applied to:
*First the Barbary Coast (Maghrebinian countries in North Africa) was de facto independent (dominated by military governors, soon de facto princes, styled [[dey]], [[bey]] or [[beylerbey]], and by the [[raïs]], Muslim [[Barbary corsairs|corsairs]]), but nominally an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] province.

French colonial expansion was not limited to the [[New World]], however. In [[Senegal]] in [[West Africa]], the French began to establish trading posts along the coast in 1624. In 1664, the [[French East India Company]] was established to compete for trade in the [[far East|east]]. Colonies were established in India in [[Chandernagore]] (1673) and [[Pondicherry district|Pondichéry]] in the south east (1674), and later at [[Yanam, French India|Yanam]] (1723), [[Mahé, India|Mahé]] (1725), and [[Karikal]] (1739) (see [[French India]]). Colonies were also founded in the Indian Ocean, on the Île de Bourbon ([[Réunion]], 1664), [[Isle de France (Mauritius)|Isle de France]] (now [[Mauritius]], 1718), and the [[Seychelles]] (1756).

A '''term''' is a period of [[wikt:duration|duration]], [[time]] or [[wikt:occurrence|occurrence]], in relation to an [[Phenomenon|event]]. To differentiate an [[Interval (time)|interval]] or duration, common phrases are used to distinguish the observance of [[length]] are near-term or short-term, medium-term or mid-term and long-term.

It is also used as part of a [[calendar]] [[year]], especially one of the three parts of an [[academic term]] and [[employment|working]] year in the [[United Kingdom]]: [[Michaelmas term]], [[Hilary term]] / [[Lent term]] or [[Trinity term]] / [[Easter term]], the equivalent to the [[Academic term#United States|American semester]]. In [[United States|America]] there is a [[United States midterm election|midterm election]] held in the middle of the four-year presidential term, there are also academic [[midterm exam]]s.

In '''[[economics]]''', it is the period required for economic agents to reallocate resources, and generally reestablish [[Economic equilibrium|equilibrium]]. The actual length of this period, usually numbered in years or decades, varies widely depending on circumstantial context. During the long term, all factors are variable.

In '''[[finance]]''' or financial operations of borrowing and investing, what is considered ''long-term'' is usually above 3 years, with ''medium-term'' usually between 1 and 3 years and ''short-term'' usually under 1 year.  It is also used in some countries to indicate a fixed term investment such as a [[term deposit]].

In law, the term of a [[contract]] is the duration for which it is to remain in effect (not to be confused with the meaning of "term" that denotes any [[contractual term|provision of a contract]]). A [[fixed-term contract]] is one concluded for a pre-defined time.

==Other terms==
{{wiktionary|term|short-term|medium-term|long-term}}
*[[Term of office]], the length of time a person serves in a particular office
*[[Term of patent]], the maximum period during which a patent can be maintained in force

'''''The Message of the Sphinx: A Quest for the Hidden Legacy of Mankind''''' ('''''Keeper of Genesis''''' in the United Kingdom) is a [[pseudoscience]] book written by [[Graham Hancock]] and [[Robert Bauval]] in 1996 which argues that the creation of the [[Great Sphinx of Giza|Sphinx]] and [[Giza Necropolis|Pyramids]] occurred as far back as [[Paleolithic|10,500 BC]] using [[astronomical]] data.

==Overview==
Working from the premise that the Giza complex encodes a message, the book begins with the fringe [[Sphinx water erosion hypothesis]], evidence that the authors believe suggests that that deep erosion patterns on the flanks of the Sphinx were caused by 1000 years of heavy rain.  The authors go on to suggest, using computer simulations of the sky, that the pyramids, representing the three stars of [[Orion's Belt]], along with associated causeways and alignments, [[Orion Correlation Theory|constitute a record in stone]] of the celestial array at the vernal equinox in 10,500 BC. This moment, they contend, represents [[Zep Tepi]], the "First Time," often referred to in the hieroglyphic record. They state that the initiation rituals of the Egyptian pharaohs replicate on Earth the sun's journey through the stars in this remote era, and they suggest that the "Hall of Records" of a lost civilisation may be located by treating the Giza Plateau as a template of these same ancient skies.&lt;ref name="The Message of the Sphinx"/&gt;

==Reception==
Erik N. Jensen regards the authors' linkage of homosexuality and Nazism as the recurrence of a "pernicious myth", originating in 1930s attacks on Nazism by [[Socialist]]s and [[Communist]]s and "long since dispelled" by "serious scholarship".&lt;ref name=jensen&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1353/sex.2002.0008 |author=Erik N. Jensen |date=January–April 2002 |title=The Pink Triangle and Political Consciousness: Gays, Lesbians, and the Memory of Nazi Persecution |journal=Journal of the History of Sexuality |volume=11 |issue=1/2 |pages=319&amp;ndash;349, pp. 322&amp;ndash;323 and n. 19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jensen sees the book as coming about in "the aftermath of an [[Oregon]] [[Measure 9|measure]] to repeal [[gay rights]]".&lt;ref name=jensen/&gt; Dorthe Seifert cites it as a response to increasing awareness of Nazi persecution of homosexuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2979/HIS.2003.15.2.94 |author=Dorthe Seifert |date=Fall 2003 |title=Between Silence and License: The Representation of the National Socialist Persecution of Homosexuality in Anglo-American Fiction and Film |journal=History and Memory |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=94&amp;ndash;129, p. 94 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Christine L. Mueller argues that the historical record does not support Abrams' assertions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Other Side of the Pink Triangle: Still a Pink Triangle |url=http://www.pink-triangle.org/ptps/revresp.html |date=October 24, 1994 |accessdate=2008-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bob Moser, writing for the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]], says the book was promoted by anti-gay groups and that historians agree its premise is "utterly false".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Intelligence Report |publisher=[[Southern Poverty Law Center]] |issue=117 |date=Spring 2005 |title=Making Myths |author=Bob Moser |url=http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?sid=328 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jonathan Zimmerman, a historian at [[New York University]], wrote that the claim that gay people helped bring Nazism to Germany "is a flat-out lie."&lt;ref name="Zimmerman"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=[[The Bakersfield Californian]]/History News Service |publisher= |issue= |date=August 27, 2011 |title=Did Nazis persecute gays, or were they gay themselves? |first=Jonathan |last=Zimmerman |url=http://www.bakersfield.com/opinion/forum/x254542695/Did-Nazis-persecute-gays-or-were-they-gay-themselves }}&lt;/ref&gt; Zimmerman, points out that "Between 1933 and 1945, the Nazis arrested roughly 100,000 men as homosexuals. Most convicted gays were sent to prison; between 5,000 and 15,000 were interned in concentration camps, where they wore pink triangles to signify their supposed crime."&lt;ref name="Zimmerman"/&gt; He further notes, "To win their release from the camps, some gays were forced to undergo castration. Others were mutilated or murdered in so-called medical experiments by Nazi doctors, who insisted that homosexuality was a disease that could be 'cured'."&lt;ref name="Zimmerman"/&gt; In addition, "Hitler authorized an edict in 1941 prescribing the death penalty [...] for SS and police members found guilty of gay activity."&lt;ref name="Zimmerman"/&gt;&lt;ref name=HERZOG&gt;{{cite book|last1=Herzog|first1=ed. by Dagmar|title=Sexuality and German fascism|date=2005|publisher=Berghahn Books|location=New York|isbn=9781571815514|page=265|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=UZb5B_DGXuIC&amp;pg=PA265&amp;lpg=PA265&amp;dq=1941+death+penalty+SS+and+police+members+found+guilty+of+gay+activity&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fc2hSbuxYI&amp;sig=2n8bEcCqFcJ0sgkd2saFXe5i60Y&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=O3c3VaGDMobdmAWb7IGAAg&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAw|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Transgender Oral History Project''' is an initiative by and for the transgender community. TOHP collects interviews and produces multimedia content featuring a stories of [[transgender]]-identified people, and exists to empower trans folks through sharing stories of their lives. The Transgender Oral History Project is also active in the community, hosting events in many states including [[Massachusetts]], [[Illinois]], [[Iowa]], Seattle, [[Philadelphia]] and [[New York City]].

==Goals==
According to the official website, the Transgender Oral History Project's goals are to build community, encourage inter-generational discussion, framing contemporary issues that transgender people faced within a broader context, highlight individuals, communities, and organizations struggling with trans issues that are not addressed by mainstream discourses and portray how political, social, and historical circumstances impact transgender lives.

== Founding ==
The Trans Oral History project was founded in 2009 by André Pérez as began documenting the evolution of the first ever New England Transgender Pride March. He went on to create a multimedia exhibit entitled, "Community in Transition: 40 Years of Struggle" that incorporated archival materials from the Sexual Minorities Archives and the first set of interviews from the Transgender Oral History Project. This exhibit has been featured at Marlboro College, University of Illinois Chicago, and the Translating Identities Conference.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uvm.edu/~tic/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable Past Projects ==
In 2010, a poster describing the Compton's Cafeteria riot was featured in the anthology, [http://www.justseeds.org/josh_macphee/04cphbook.html Celebrate People's History], published by the Just Seeds Collective.

In 2011, the Trans Oral History Project participated in a two-month residency at the University of Illinois, Chicago's LGBTQ Resource Center. TOHP collective members lead a participatory workshop series and created a multimedia exhibition featuring interview materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chicagofilmmakers.org/cf/content/cdmpf-2013-finalists?page=2 |title=Chicago Filmmakers Digital Media Production Fund Finalists |date= |accessdate=2014-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, [https://web.archive.org/web/20140720132141/http://transoralhistory.com/ilive/curriculum I Live for Trans Education: A Youth Toolkit] officially launched. I Live featured mini documentaries paired with interactive activities to teach about issues that impact the transgender community. The toolkit is a resource for trans educators, youth workers, and youth leaders to educate about issues that impact the trans community from an intersectional perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-12-19/news/ct-met-trans-101-profiles-20111219_1_gender-identity-gender-variance-transgender |title=Finding Their Gender Identities |date= |accessdate=2014-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; TOHP also began partnering with [[StoryCorps]], the largest oral history project in North America, to record and preserve stories. A TOHP interview was featured on WBEZ in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wbez.org/series/storycorps/transgender-man-learns-accept-love-110424 |title=Transgender Man Learns to Accept Love |date= |accessdate=2014-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Trans Oral History Project now serves as a community archive for StoryCorps' recordings with transgender individuals, and is in the process of integrating those interviews into their publicly accessible digital archive of transgender stories.

The '''Wakker Prize''' (in German: ''Wakkerpreis'', in French ''Prix Wakker'', in Italian ''Premio Wakker'') is awarded annually by the [[Swiss Heritage Society]] to a [[Municipality of Switzerland]] for the development and preservation of its architectural heritage.

At the beginning, the prize honoured municipalities which did special needs for preservation of the old towns. Recently,{{When|date=January 2015}} the prize also honours municipalities that develop their townscapes on a specific leading point. This might be an estimated use of an old industrial facility or a successful combination between old and new basic structure of a building.

In 2005, the prize was given to the [[Swiss Federal Railways]], rather than a municipality, because of the jubilee of the Swiss Heritage Society.

The prize is named for [[Henri-Louis Wakker]].

==Criteria==
To get this prize, municipalities have to follow the named criteria:
* A visible, qualitative development and upgrading of townscape in a contemporary manner.
* To be respectful towards with old settlement pattern.
* An active input for above-average architectural quality, due to a good example of the municipality.
* The current place-planning prefers the development of the prize.
* At the end are following issues important for the overall assessment, protection of the area, sustainability, traffic planning and residential quality.

The '''Yangon Heritage Trust''' ({{lang-my|ရန်ကုန်အမွေအနှစ် ထိန်းသိမ်းစောင့်ရှောက်ရေးအဖွဲ့}}; abbreviated '''YHT''') is a [[non-governmental organisation]] founded by [[Thant Myint-U]] to conserve historic buildings in [[Yangon]] (formerly Rangoon), the former capital of [[Burma]].&lt;ref name="robinson-2012-03-09"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/366b4332-69b5-11e1-8996-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2g4JkxJTa|title=Myanmar pushes to save colonial buildings|last=Robinson|first=Gwen|date=9 March 2012|work=Financial Times|accessdate=27 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/archives/5789|title=Conservation Strategy Drafted for Historic Rangoon|last=Hpyo Wai Tha|date=6 June 2012|work=The Irrawaddy|accessdate=27 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yangon has Asia's largest collection of colonial-era buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/life/The-race-is-on-in-Yangon-30212999.html|title=The race is on in Yangon|last=KYAW YE LYNN|author2=PETER JANSSEN |work=DEUTSCHE PRESSE-AGENTUR|accessdate=27 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Trust has proposed to designate small zones within the city centre (particularly in [[Downtown Yangon]]) as heritage areas and envisions a joint public-private collaboration whereby private investors restore heritage buildings for commercial use while maintaining the character of the areas.&lt;ref name="robinson-2012-03-09"/&gt; The Trust also advocates a conservation plan led by the [[private sector]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mmtimes.com/2012/news/619/news61901.html|title=Historic Yangon cityscape thrown a lifeline|last=Kean|first=Thomas|date=19 March 2012|work=Myanmar Times|accessdate=27 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
