      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5591">'''Angelic tongues''' are the languages supposedly used by angels. It usually refers to sung praise in [[Second Temple period]] Jewish materials.

==Dead Sea Scrolls==
[[Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice]] is the principal source for angelic tongues at [[Qumran]]. The texts are fragmentary but appear to relate to praise tongues:
*[...] through the wonderful height [...] tongue of purity [...] gods (~yhla), seven [...] 4Q400 3 1, 1-2
* ...Psalm of praise, on the tongue of the fou[rth]...[Ps]alm of [tha]nksgiving, on the tongue of the fifth...[Psalm] of exultation, on the tongue of the sixth...Psalm of [singing, on the to]ngue of the seventh of the [chief] pri[nces,] a powerful song [to the God] of ho[lines] with its se[ven] wo[nd]er[ful songs] 4Q403 1 1, 1-6
* Proclaim his glory with the tongue of all who proclaim knowledge, his wonderful songs with the mouth of all who proclaim [him. For he is] God of all who sing {knowledge} for ever, and Judge in his power over all the spirits of understanding. 4Q4031 1 36-37
* ...The tongue of the first will be strengthened seven times with the tongue of the second to him....{this is repeated for the series up to the seventh}... 4Q403 1 2, 27-30

It is not clear whether the angelic tongues are coherent, intelligible to man. However, since Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice is itself related to sung praise at the Qumran community, there is a parallel with coherent angelic praise tongues in Testament of Job.&lt;ref&gt;Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice, edited by James H. Charlesworth and Carol A. Newsom. Theological Studies 54  2003 649–653.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John C. Poirier ''Tongues of Angels: Concept of Angelic Languages in Classical Jewish and Christian Texts '' 2010. XI, 224 pages. WUNT II 287  p110 "Cf. Sheres and Blau 1995:84: "But the angels' speech [in the Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice] is not recorded. Why do we not hear what they are saying? One commentator has suggested that the big difference between the 'tongues of men and of angels' rendered their idiom unintelligible. Perhaps also, at such auspicious moments the sectarians themselves spoke in tongues (an ecstatic incomprehensible language), a chanting that would drown out what was going on. The sectarians' taste for the esoteric is evident elsewhere"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George J. Brooke, Hindy Najman, Loren T. Stuckenbruck ''The significance of Sinai: traditions about Sinai and divine Revelation in Judaism and Christianity.'' 2008 p57 "Participation in the Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice liturgy is reserved for those sufficiently righteous and ... in order to acquire “tongues of angels” would seem to have been such an elite."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Loren T. Stückenbruck ''Angel veneration and Christology: a study in early Judaism and in the Christology of the Apocalypse of John, by Loren T. Stuckenbruck. WUNT 2/70'' 1995 p156 ''The Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice This brings us to a consideration of the angelic sabbath-liturgy (Shi- rot 'Olat ha-Shabbat), which was not fully published and ... and seven tongues, each being seven-fold more powerful than the next ...''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Testament of Job==
The pseudepigraphical [[Testament of Job]] (ca.100 BCE–100CE) contains a conclusion which is believed to relate to the compiling of the hymnbook used by a [[Therapeutae]] community.&lt;ref&gt;''Testament of Job'' in Charlesworth J.H., The Old Testament Pseudepigrapha Vol.II, Doubleday 1985&lt;/ref&gt; Job gives one of his daughters "a cord" (a stringed instrument of some kind?) 
* "And she took on another heart—no longer minded toward earthly things—but ecstatically in the angelic dialect, sending up a hymn to God in accord with the style of the angels. And as she spoke ecstatically, she allowed “The Spirit” to be on her garment." (T. Job 48:2-3)&lt;ref&gt;http://wesley.nnu.edu/biblical_studies/noncanon/ot/pseudo/test-job.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
Job’s other daughters likewise took on “the dialect of archons”, “the dialect of those and the “dialect of the cherubim” (T. Job 49:1-50:3). The “cherubim” are also mentioned Songs of the Sabbath Sacrifice as blessing God (4Q403 1 2, 15, cf. 4Q405 20 2, 3). 

There is parallel description of sung prophecy among the Therapeutae in [[Alexandria]] by [[Philo]], but no mention there of angelic tongues.&lt;ref&gt;Philo, On the Contemplative Life http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/yonge/book34.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Testament==
A possible reference to Jewish practices of angelic tongues is 1Co13:1 "If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal." The distinction "of men" and "of angels" may suggests that a distinction was known to the Corinthians. If a distinction is intended then 1Co14:10 "There are doubtless many different languages in the world, and none is without meaning" may imply that "tongues of men" were intelligible, whereas 1Co14:2 For one who speaks in a tongue speaks not to men but to God; for no one understands him, but he utters mysteries in the Spirit." refers to angelic tongues. The problem with this is that the "angelic" tongues documented at Qumran and among the Therapeutae appear to be inspired, but coherent and intelligible, sung praise. Against this is the view of Dunn that "It is evident then that Paul thinks of [[glossolalia]] as language". {{dubious|date=December 2015}} &lt;ref&gt;James D. G. Dunn Jesus and the Spirit: "A Study of the Religious and Charismatic Experience of Jesus and the First Christians as Reflected in the New Testament," p. 244 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Arendalsk''', '''Arendal dialect''' or '''Arendal Norwegian''' ([[Bokmål]] and [[Nynorsk]]: ''Arendalsk'', ''Arendalsdialekten''; the Arendal dialect: ''Ændalsk'') is a dialect of [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] used in [[Arendal]].

==Phonology==

* Intervocalic {{IPA|/p, t, k/}} are realized as voiced {{IPA|[{{IPA link|b}}, {{IPA link|d}}, {{IPA link|ɡ}}]}}. This feature appeared in this dialect in the 20th century.&lt;ref name="ehp"&gt;{{cite web|title="E kåmmår hen te du i sta" — Eydehavnportalen|url=http://www.aaks.no/Eydehavn/samfunnet/dialekt/|accessdate=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kommune"&gt;{{cite web|title=Litt om arendalsdialekten - Arendal kommune |url=http://www.arendal.kommune.no/Innbygger/Tjenester/Kultur-idrett-og-fritid/Kulturhistorie/Manedens-kulturminne/Manedens-kulturminne-juliaugust-2011-Arendalsdialekten/Litt-om-arendalsdialekten/ |accessdate=24 July 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150725071529/http://www.arendal.kommune.no/Innbygger/Tjenester/Kultur-idrett-og-fritid/Kulturhistorie/Manedens-kulturminne/Manedens-kulturminne-juliaugust-2011-Arendalsdialekten/Litt-om-arendalsdialekten/ |archivedate=25 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A uvular {{IPAblink|ʀ}} realization of {{IPA|/r/}} was established in Arendal before the 20th century.&lt;ref name="ehp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kommune"/&gt;
* {{IPA|/ʀ/}} is frequently dropped, so that e.g. ''Lars'' becomes ''Læs''.&lt;ref name="kommune"/&gt;
* The ending {{angbr|–er}} is pronounced {{IPA|[ɔ]}}, so that the word for 'basement' is ''kjeller'' in Bokmål, but ''kjellå'' in the Arendal dialect.&lt;ref name="ehp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kommune"/&gt;

According to the linguist Gjert Kristoffersen, a recent change is that the postvocalic {{IPA|/ʀ/}} is ''vocalized'' to {{IPA|[æ̯]}}, rather than dropped. The phonetic diphthongs {{IPA|[ʉæ̯]}} and {{IPA|[uæ̯]}} may be monophthongized and lowered to, respectively, {{IPA|[œː]}} and {{IPA|[ɔː]}}, so that the words for 'to do gymnastics' and 'thorn' (which phonemically are, respectively, {{IPA|/²tʉʀne/}} and {{IPA|/²tuʀne/}}) vary in their phonetic realization between, respectively, {{IPA|[²tʉæ̯nə ~ ²tœːnə]}} and {{IPA|[²tuæ̯nə ~ ²tɔːnə]}}. This process may be extended to mid vowels.{{sfnp|Kristoffersen|2000|p=36}}

===Tonemes===

====Phonetic realization====
Tonemes of the Arendal dialect are the same as those of the Oslo dialect; accent 1 is low-rising, whereas accent 2 is falling-rising.{{sfnp|Kristoffersen|2000|pp=236–237}}

==Notable speakers==
* [[Gjert Kristoffersen]]{{sfnp|Kristoffersen|2000|p=36}}
* Rockebandet Ændal, a heavy metal band that sings in the Arendal dialect

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6858">An '''authors' conference''' or '''writers' conference''' is a type of [[:wikt:conference|conference]] where [[writers]] gather to review their [[writing|written works]] and suggest improvements. This process helps an author improve his or her work and learn to be a better writer for future works, both by receiving [[critique]]s of their own work and by [[mentoring]] the work of the other authors. Writers may also benefit from meeting and hearing from professionals in related fields, such as agents, editors, illustrators, publishers, and providers of other relevant services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.writersdigest.com/editor-blogs/guide-to-literary-agents/literary-agents-explain-why-they-attend-conferences-and-its-not-what-you-think|work=Writers Digest|author=Hoffman, Scott Hoffman | title=Literary Agents Explain Why They Attend Conferences (And It's Not What You Think)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike most other conference styles, an authors' conference is very [[participatory]]. Most conferences are divided into [[presentation]]s, each of which has a clear separation of roles among a one or more [[Public speaker|presenter]]s and an audience. While authors' conferences may include some such presentations, writers' conferences also include numerous sessions wherein an author does not present his or her work but rather listens while the other participants discuss the work. In this way, the author gains an understanding of what readers learn by reading the work.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

An authors' conference consists of two phases, shepherding and writers' workshops. Shepherding usually (but not always&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/thewritingcenter-ce/conference |website=Hunter.CUNY.edu |title=Writers' Conference and Intensives: Hunter College's 4th Annual Writers' Conference |date=June 7, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714220817/http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/thewritingcenter-ce/conference |archivedate=2014-07-14 |df= }} Intensive writing workshops precede the conference.&lt;/ref&gt;) occurs before the conference meeting, and the meeting itself is organized as a writers' workshop.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

One popular series of authors' conferences is the [[Pattern Languages of Programming]] conferences, held to encourage and assist authors of [[software design pattern]]s and [[pattern language]]s.

==Shepherding==
The shepherding process occurs before the conference meeting. Authors submit papers for the conference, then each paper is assigned to a shepherd, an experienced author who works with the submitter to improve his or her paper. The process often consists of three iterations in as many weeks where the shepherd makes suggestions for improvement and the submitter incorporates the suggestions. This one-on-one mentoring using the submitter's unfinished work as an example is very effective for teaching the submitter how to be a better writer, although its effectiveness is ultimately determined by the participants' dedication and their working relationship. At the end of the shepherding process, the shepherd recommends whether to accept the submission for review at the conference. An accepted submission should meet minimal quality standards for effective evaluation in the writers' workshop, and should have been improved significantly by the submitter during the shepherding process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writers' workshop==
The writers' workshop process occurs during the conference meeting. The workshop consists of 6–10 sessions, one per submission to be reviewed. The workshop participants are the authors of those submissions and any other reviewers the authors choose to accept. In a session, the authors of the submission listen quietly while the other participants discuss what they liked about the submission and suggest improvements. This gives the authors of the submission insight into what information readers are learning from the work and ideas for improving the work. Reviewers discussing a work are careful to make productive comments, both because the author is listening and because in other sessions that author will become the reviewer and make comments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Baenan''' (''Baenã, Baenán, Baena'') is a poorly attested language of [[Brazil]].  The last remaining speaker lived in [[Bahia]], [[Brazil]] in 1940.  The language of this speaker was associated with the Baenan language as the last members of the Baenan tribe lived in Paragaçú, [[Bahia]], near where the language was attested.  There are nine known words of Baenan:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

'''''Bahasa''''', '''''bhasa''''', '''''basa''''', or '''''phasa''''' is the word for "language" in many Asian languages, which derives from the [[Sanskrit]] word भाषा ''{{IAST|bhāṣā}}'' "speech, spoken language". In many modern languages in [[South Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]] which have been influenced by Sanskrit or [[Pali]], ''bahasa'' and cognate terms are used to mean "language" in general.

==Usage==
The word "Bahasa" in English is sometimes used to refer specifically to the [[Malay language]] (especially its [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] variety), usually by Western expatriates and their English-speaking Malaysian-Indonesian associates. This usage is of colonial origin, has never gained currency in linguistic circles and is considered incorrect by some.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050508115242/http://www.hawaii.edu/indolang/malay.html "Bahasa Indonesia: The Indonesian Language," George Quinn, Australian National University]&lt;/ref&gt; When Malaysian or Indonesian speakers refer to other languages, the non-capitalized word "bahasa" ("language") is used; for example, English and Italian are called ''bahasa Inggris'' and ''bahasa Italia'' respectively.

{{Use Bangladeshi English|date=October 2017}}

'''Bangladeshi English''' or '''Banglish''' is one of the dialects of [[English language|English]] characteristic of [[Bangladesh]].

== Use ==
An estimated 18 million Bangladeshis can use English as a [[second language]].

[[Education in Bangladesh|Education]], [[newspaper]]s, business and nongovernmental organizations in English are prevalent throughout Bangladesh.

English is the principal language of the [[Law of Bangladesh|Bangladeshi upper judiciary]], including the [[Bangladesh Supreme Court]] and the [[Dhaka High Court]]. [[Bengali language|Bengali]] is the sole [[official language]], but English is often used secondarily for official purposes, especially in the judiciary. The [[Government of Bangladesh]] extensively uses English as a [[working language]]. Bangladeshi laws are written in both English and Bengali.

== History ==
The territory of modern Bangladesh was the heartland of the [[Bengal Presidency]] in the [[British Empire]].

Historically, the Bengali [[bhadralok]] class were heavily influenced by the [[British accent]]. The efforts of [[Sir Syed Ahmed Khan]] played a key role in building an English-speaking Muslim intelligentsia and middle class in Bengal. Modern Bangladeshi English is noted for its neutral accent, in comparison to other forms of Asian English, and has been influenced by the [[American accent]]. Spellings continue to be adopted from [[British English]]. English was an official language of [[East Pakistan]]. After independence, the [[Constitution of Bangladesh]] was written in both English and Bengali in 1972.

However, successive Bangladeshi governments have converted many original English-medium universities, schools and colleges to Bengali instruction in order to spread mass education. In 1987, President [[Hussain Muhammad Ershad]] replaced English with Bengali as the language of most of the lower courts, which was reversed in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=English |title=English – Banglapedia |publisher=En.banglapedia.org |date=2014-06-08 |accessdate=2015-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the High Court banned the use of "Banglish", described as a slang mixture of Bengali and English, in radio and television programs to prevent the corruption of both languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=AFP |url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/337843/bangladesh-bans-banglish-to-protect-local-tongue/ |title=Bangladesh bans 'Banglish' to protect local tongue – The Express Tribune |publisher=Tribune.com.pk |date=2012-02-17 |accessdate=2015-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Literature ==
[[Bangladeshi English literature|English literature in Bangladesh]] includes the early works of [[Begum Rokeya]], one of the world's earliest [[feminist science fiction]] writers, and [[Rabindranath Tagore]], whose English translation of [[Gitanjali]] won him the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1913.

== Numbering system ==
The [[Indian numbering system]] is preferred for digit grouping. When written in words, or when spoken,
numbers less than 100,000/100 000 are expressed just as they are in Standard English.  Numbers including and beyond 100,000 /
100 000 are expressed in a subset of the South Asian numbering system.

Thus, the following scale is used:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
|-

[[File:Hohlstecker und Hohlbuchse 5,5x2,5.jpg|thumb|350px|A common coaxial power connector, male and female, 5.5 × 2.5 mm]]
[[File:Photo-RoundPowerConnectors.jpg|thumb|350px|right|Common DC power connectors]]

A '''coaxial power connector''' is an electrical [[DC connector|power connector]] used for attaching [[extra-low voltage]] devices such as [[consumer electronics]] to external [[electricity]].  Also known as '''barrel connectors''', '''concentric barrel connectors''' or '''tip connectors''', these small [[cylindrical]] connectors come in an enormous variety of sizes.

Barrel plug [[Electrical connector|connector]]s are commonly used to interface the secondary side of a power supply with the device. Some of these jacks contain a normally closed switch; the switch can disconnect internal batteries whenever the external power supply is connected.

== Connector construction and terminology ==
The connector pairs for barrel connectors are defined in terms of 'plugs' and 'receptacles'; receptacles are more commonly called 'sockets' or 'jacks' (US). Receptacles may be panel-mounted or circuit board-mounted. Plugs are on cables. Some 'in-line' receptacles are also cable-mounted.

There is a long history in electrical engineering of referring to such power plugs''—that is to say, plugs with holes instead of prongs—''as female,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Meschenmoser|first1=William|title=Entry for Patent US1157026A|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US1157026A|website=Google Patents|accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  particularly regarding coaxial transmission of electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Quackenbush|first1=Edward Clarke|title=Entry for Patent US2422982A|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US2422982A|website=Google Patents|accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Type [[N connectors]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kuester|first1=Edward|title=Common Coaxial Connectors|url=http://ecee.colorado.edu/~kuester/Coax/connchart.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Power Connectors|url=https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/connector-basics/power-connectors|accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and all [[EC 60320#Appliance couplers IEC 60320 "appliance coupler"]] plugs are examples of this. That said, while IEC 60320 provides gender-based standards for higher-voltage plugs (such as the cable plugged into a standard computer power supply), they have not yet defined [[gender of connectors and fasteners|gender-based standards]] for low-voltage coaxial power connectors such as those discussed herein; I.E., which component is "male" and which "female." As a result, there are varying opinions in this regard. Many industrial suppliers avoid gender terminology&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Power is generally supplied ''by'' a plug ''to'' a receptacle. Cables are available with one in-line receptacle [[fan-out|fanning out]] to a number of plugs, so that many devices may be supplied by one supply. As the use of a plug implies a cable, even a short stub, some power supplies carry panel-mounted receptacles instead to avoid this cable, i.e. the normal convention of power from plug to receptacle is reversed. Cables for such cases are available with a plug at each end, although cables or adapters with two ''receptacles'' are not widely available.

=== Plug (female) ===
On the female plug, the outer body is metallic and cylindrical in shape, and comprises one of the two contacts. The second, inside contact is a hollow metallic cylinder constructed to accept insertion of the pin in the corresponding male connector. The inner and outer barrels are separated by an insulating layer. The outer contact is generally called the '''barrel''', '''sleeve''' or '''ring''', and the inner contact is called the '''tip'''.

=== Receptacle (male) ===
There is typically a single spring-loaded contact at the side of the male connector and a pin in the center corresponding to the intended female plug.

==Connector sizes==
There are many different sizes of coaxial power connectors (see table at end of this article).

Contact ratings commonly vary from unspecified up to 5 amperes (11 amperes for special high-power versions). Voltage is often unspecified, but may be up to 48V with 12V typical. The smaller types usually have lower current and voltage ratings.

It is quite possible that new sizes will continue to appear and disappear. One possible reason that a particular manufacturer may use a new size is to discourage use of third-party power supplies, either for technical reasons or to [[vendor lock-in|force use of their own accessories]], or both.

The sizes and shapes of connectors do not consistently correspond to the same power specifications across manufacturers and models. Two connectors from different manufacturers with different sizes could potentially be attached to power supplies with the same voltage and current. Alternatively, connectors of the same size can be part of power supplies with different voltages and currents. Use of the wrong power supply may cause severe equipment damage, or even fire.

== Common sizes and interchangeability ==
[[File:Klinken- und Hohlstecker.jpg|thumb|350px|right|Some common DC power connectors]]

Generic plugs are often described by their inside diameter, such as ''2.1mm DC plugs'' and ''2.5mm DC ([[direct current]]) plugs''.

After the two common 5.5mm OD (outer diameter) plugs, the next-most common size is 3.5mm OD with a 1.3mm ID (inner diameter), usually about 9.5mm in length, although both longer and shorter versions also exist. These 3.5mm OD plugs are normally used for lower voltages and currents.

== Locking and retention features ==
A ring-shaped 'locking detent' or 'high-retention feature', present on the barrel of some DC coaxial connectors, is a feature intended to prevent accidental disconnection.  Typically, this feature is a conical cut-back section of the tip, just behind the insulator that separates the inner from outer contact surfaces.

A 'lock-ring DC coaxial connector' uses a captive threaded ring or collar to secure the connection between the plug and jack. This design offers strong resistance to unplugging when used properly.
[[File:Lock-Ring Connectors.jpg|thumb|right|Lock-ring DC coaxial connectors. The knurled barrel allows the plug to be secured to jacks that have mating male threads.]]

A 'lock-tab DC coaxial connector' (also called 'bayonet lock') offers a compromise that resists unplugging, but which will disengage when pulled hard enough. This connector uses small metal tab protrusions on the connector barrel to lock the plug in place, requiring a special push-and-rotate motion to engage the locks.

==Standards==
[[File:EIAJconnector2 edit.jpg|thumb|250px|Close-up of a yellow-tipped [[EIAJ connector]]. Note 2 round adapter pins on the opposite end.]]

There are several standards in existence, such as IEC, [[EIAJ connector|EIAJ]] in Japan and [[DIN]] in Germany. More recently, some manufacturers appear to have implemented their own system correlating voltage and plug size. In addition, there appears to be a trend to standardize DC connector to negative '''barrel''' (or sleeve) of a coaxial power connector.

===IEC 60130-10===
IEC 60130-10:1971 defines five DC power connectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Connectors for frequencies below 3 MHz. Part 10: Connectors for coupling an external low-voltage power supply to portable entertainment equipment |date=1 January 1971 |id=IEC 60130-10 ed1.0 |url=http://webstore.iec.ch/webstore/webstore.nsf/Artnum_PK/856 |publisher=IEC |accessdate=18 April 2012 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Type A:  5.5&amp;nbsp;mm OD, 2.1&amp;nbsp;mm ID (with optional screw lock)
*Type A:  5.5&amp;nbsp;mm OD, 2.5&amp;nbsp;mm ID (with optional screw lock)

*Type D:  6.3&amp;nbsp;mm OD, 3.1&amp;nbsp;mm ID
*Type E:  3.4&amp;nbsp;mm OD, 1.3&amp;nbsp;mm ID

===EIAJ power connectors===
{{details|EIAJ connector}}

Five plug and matching socket or [[jack (connector)|jack]] designs are defined by the [[EIAJ connector|EIAJ standard RC-5320A]] (also called JEITA RC-5320A). Each of these plugs is used with a specified [[voltage]] range. Most manufacturers use a yellow insulating material to distinguish these plugs from other similar-looking DC plugs.

*EIAJ-01 for 0–3.15 V
*EIAJ-02 for 3.15–6.3 V
*EIAJ-03 for 6.3–10.5 V
*EIAJ-04 for 10.5–13.5 V (also called JSBP 4)
*EIAJ-05 for 13.5–18 V (also called JSBP 5)

EIAJ-04 and 05 have an internal male pin in the plug. The 01 through 03 sizes do not and are similar to the generic plugs in structure. These five EIAJ plugs are 9.5&amp;nbsp;mm in length and have a current rating of 2A.

There are two other, less common, connectors defined by EIAJ; RC-5321 and RC-5322. The latter is designed for both 12 V and 24 V automotive applications.

===DIN 45323===
The German national standards organization [[DIN]] (Deutsches Institut für Normung—German Institute for Standardization) issued [[DIN 45323]], which defines two DC power plug and jack (respectively) sizes. At least one of these sizes has a maximum rating of 34&amp;nbsp;V and 3&amp;nbsp;A. The information here is inferred from catalog references,&lt;ref name=LumbergDIN&gt;{{cite web|last=Lumberg Connect GmbH|title=Power supply connectors|url=http://www.lumberg.de/main/common/serie.asp?ser=016&amp;cat=4&amp;lang=eng|accessdate=2011-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the German standard has not been translated into English yet.{{When|date=January 2018}}

*5.00&amp;nbsp;mm OD, 2.00&amp;nbsp;mm ID, 14&amp;nbsp;mm long?
*6.00&amp;nbsp;mm OD, 1.98&amp;nbsp;mm ID

== Listing of DC coaxial connectors ==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}
This list attempts to show all known sizes, and is annotated with some manufacturers producing selected types, since each manufacturer makes its own unique subset of the known types.  Note that the example part numbers given may have different connector barrel (sleeve) lengths, and are not necessarily exact equivalents.  There are many more design variants than can be listed in this table, so only a small sampling of part numbers is given.

Connector size is often listed in the format OD (outer diameter) x ID (inner diameter) x L (length of barrel) and expressed in millimeters. Designations may vary between manufacturers.

Coaxial plugs that have a male center pin will have another measurement, Center Pin Diameter (CPD). These plugs are often used for higher power applications such as portable computers.

There are a number of sizes listed below that appear to be quite similar, and while the tolerances of these connectors are typically indicated as ±0.05 or ±0.03&amp;nbsp;mm by the manufacturers, there is still ambiguity as to whether two sizes differing by only 0.05&amp;nbsp;mm (or where the specification is only given to the nearest 0.10&amp;nbsp;mm) warrants listing them separately here.{{original research inline|date=May 2013}}

== History ==
{{Main|A Mathematical Theory of Communication|Jakobson's functions of language|Outline of communication|Harold Innis's communications theories}}

=== Origins ===
"The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point either exactly or approximately a message selected at another point."&lt;ref name="Shannon"/&gt; [[Claude Shannon]] (1916–2001)

The origins of communication theory is linked to the development of [[information theory]] in the early 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Management Effectiveness and Communication, MBA 665, Online Resources, Communication Models |year=2008 |publisher=Bob Jones University |location= |isbn= |page= |pages= |url=http://www.shkaminski.com/Classes/Handouts/Communication%20Models.htm |accessdate= November 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Limited information-theoretic ideas had been developed at [[Bell Labs]], all implicitly assuming events of equal probability.

[[Harry Nyquist]]'s 1924 paper, ''Certain Factors Affecting Telegraph Speed'', contains a theoretical section quantifying "intelligence" and the "line speed" at which it can be transmitted by a communication system.

[[Ralph Hartley]]'s 1928 paper, ''Transmission of Information,'' uses the word "information" as a measurable quantity, reflecting the receiver's ability to distinguish one sequence of symbols from any other. The natural unit of information was therefore the decimal digit, much later renamed the [[Hartley (unit)|hartley]] in his honour as a unit or scale or measure of information.

[[Alan Turing]] in 1940 used similar ideas as part of the statistical analysis of the breaking of the German second world war [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma|Enigma]] ciphers.

The main landmark event that opened the way to the development of communication theory was the publication of an article by [[Claude Shannon]] in the ''[[Bell System Technical Journal]]'' in July and October 1948 under the title "[[A Mathematical Theory of Communication]]".&lt;ref name="Shannon"/&gt; Shannon focused on the problem of how best to encode the information that a sender wants to transmit. He used also tools in [[probability theory]], developed by [[Norbert Wiener]]. They marked the nascent stages of applied communication theory at that time. Shannon developed [[information entropy]] as a measure for the uncertainty in a message while essentially inventing the field of information theory.

In 1949, in a declassified version of his wartime work on the mathematical theory of [[cryptography]] ("[[Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems]]"), he proved that all theoretically unbreakable ciphers must have the same requirements as the [[one-time pad]]. He is also credited with the introduction of [[Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem|sampling theory]], which is concerned with representing a continuous-time signal from a (uniform) discrete set of samples. This theory was essential in enabling telecommunications to move from analog to digital transmissions systems in the 1960s and later.

In 1951, Shannon made his fundamental contribution to [[natural language processing]] and [[computational linguistics]] with his article "Prediction and Entropy of Printed English" (1951), providing a clear quantifiable link between cultural practice and probabilistic cognition.

=== Models of communication ===
{{Main|Models of communication}}

The studies on information theory by Claude Elwood Shannon, [[Warren Weaver]] and others, prompted research on new [[Conceptual model|models]] of communication from other scientific perspectives like [[psychology]] and sociology. In science, a model is a structure that represents a theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Models in Science |last=Frigg, Roman and [[Stephan Hartmann|Hartmann, Stephan]] |first= |authorlink= |year=2009 |publisher=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |location= |isbn= |page= |pages= |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/models-science/#ModThe |accessdate= November 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars from disciplines different from [[mathematics]] and engineering began to take distance from the Shannon and Weaver models as a 'transmissible model':

{{Quotation|They developed a model of communication which was intended to assist in developing a mathematical theory of communication. Shannon and Weaver's work proved valuable for communication engineers in dealing with such issues as the capacity of various communication channels in 'bits per second'. It contributed to computer science. It led to very useful work on redundancy in language. And in making 'information' 'measurable' it gave birth to the mathematical study of 'information theory'|[[Daniel Chandler|D. Chandler]]|&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Transmission Model of Communication |last=Chandler |first=Daniel |year=1994 |publisher=University of Western Australia |location= |isbn= |page= |pages= |url=http://www.aber.ac.uk/media/Documents/short/trans.html |accessdate= November 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Elements of communication ==

Basic elements of communication made the object of study of the communication theory:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Communication process |publisher=Center for Literacy Studies of the University of Tennessee |location= |isbn= |page= |pages= |url=http://www.cls.utk.edu/pdf/ls/Week1_Lesson7.pdf |accessdate=2011-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[Communication source|Source]]''': Shannon calls this element the "information source", which "produces a message or sequence of messages to be communicated to the receiving terminal."&lt;ref name="Shannon"/&gt;
* '''Sender''': Shannon calls this element the "transmitter", which "operates on the message in some way to produce a signal suitable for transmission over the channel."&lt;ref name="Shannon"/&gt; In Aristotle, this element is the "speaker" (orator).&lt;ref name="Rhetoric"&gt;{{cite book |title=Elements of Rhetoric: Comprising an Analysis of the Laws of Moral Evidence |author1=Richard Whately |author2=Douglas Ehninger |author3=David Potter |year=1963 |publisher=Southern Illinois University Press |location= |isbn=978-0-8093-2974-8 |page= |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bYbgnLDdOkQC&amp;pg=PA8&amp;lpg=PA8&amp;dq=Ehninger,+Aristotles&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bkxHTlw9DZ&amp;sig=YdmF1zKKM74WOgoI_0jvYq6kUpo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Hku3TsybFoGviQf7of2bAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate= November 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Channel''': For Shannon, the channel is "merely the medium used to transmit the signal from transmitter to receiver."&lt;ref name="Shannon"/&gt;
* '''Receiver''': For Shannon, the receiver "performs the inverse operation of that done by the transmitter, reconstructing the message from the signal."&lt;ref name="Shannon"/&gt;
* '''Destination''': For Shannon, the destination is "the person (or thing) for whom the message is intended".&lt;ref name="Shannon"/&gt;
* '''Message''': from [[Latin]] ''mittere'', "to send". The message is a [[concept]], information, communication, or [[:wikt:statement|statement]] that is sent in a verbal, written, recorded, or visual form to the recipient.
* '''Feedback'''
* '''Entropic elements, positive and negative'''

'''Community interpreting''' is a specific type of [[interpreting]] service which is found more in community-based than organisational situations.  It is a particularly vital service in communities with large numbers of [[Ethnic minority|ethnic minorities]], enabling those minorities to access services where, due to the [[language barrier]], they would otherwise find it difficult. Situations where such interpreters are necessary are typical include medical, educational, [[House|housing]], [[social security]] and legal areas.

Community interpreters need not only to be fluent in the language that they are interpreting, but also with the [[public services]] involved, to be aware of the cultural and racial implications of the interpreting work. Interpreters are also expected to follow the Interpreter's Code of Ethics.

[[File:JanaSanskritSans ddhrya.svg|thumb|The [[Devanagari]] ''{{IAST|ddhrya}}''-ligature, as displayed in the [http://tdil.mit.gov.in/download/janasanskrit.htm JanaSanskritSans] font, which should be invoked by the layout engine to render the sequence द + ् + ध + ् + र + ् + य = द्ध्र्य.]]
[[File:Arabicrender.png|thumb|250px|The word {{lang|ar|العربية}} ''{{transl|ar|al-arabiyyah}}'', "the Arabic [language]" in Arabic, in successive stages of rendering. The first line shows the letters in left-to-right order and unjoined, as they might appear in an application without complex text layout. In the second line, bidirectional display has been applied, and in the third the [[glyph]]-shaping mechanism has rendered the letters according to context.]]

'''Complex text layout''' ('''CTL''') or '''complex text rendering''' is the [[typesetting]] of [[writing system]]s in which the shape or positioning of a [[grapheme]] depends on its relation to other graphemes. The term is used in the field of software [[internationalization]], where each grapheme is a [[character (computing)|character]].

Scripts which require CTL for proper display may be known as '''complex scripts'''. Examples include the [[Arabic alphabet]] and scripts of the [[Brahmic scripts|Brahmic family]], such as [[Devanagari]] or the [[Thai alphabet]]. Many scripts do not require CTL. For instance, the [[Latin alphabet]] or [[Chinese character]]s can be typeset by simply displaying each character one after another in straight rows or columns. However, even these scripts have alternate forms or optional features (such as [[cursive]] writing) which require CTL to produce on computers.

==Characteristics requiring CTL==
The main characteristics of CTL complexity are:
* [[Bi-directional text]], where characters may be written from either right-to-left or left-to-right direction.
* [[Context-sensitive shaping]] and [[ligature (typography)|ligature]]s, where a character may change its shape, dependent on its location and/or the surrounding characters. For example, a character in [[Arabic script]] can have as many as four different shape-forms, depending on context.
* Ordering, where the displayed order of the characters is not the same as the logical order. For example, in Devanagari, which is written from left to right, the grapheme for "short i" appears to the left of ("before") the consonant that it follows: in {{lang|sa|कि}} ''ki'', the {{lang|sa|ि}} ''-i'' should render on the left, its bow reaching until above the {{lang|sa|क}} ''k-'' to the right.

Not all occurrences of these characteristics require CTL. For example, the [[Greek alphabet]] has context-sensitive shaping of the letter [[sigma]], which appears as ς at the end of a word and σ elsewhere. However, these two forms are normally stored as different characters; for instance, [[Unicode]] has both {{unichar|03C2|GREEK SMALL LETTER FINAL SIGMA}} and {{unichar|03C3|GREEK SMALL LETTER SIGMA}}, and does not treat them as [[Unicode equivalence|equivalent]]. For collation and comparison purposes, software should consider the string "δῖος Ἀχιλλεύς" equivalent to "δῖοσ Ἀχιλλεύσ",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.unicode.org/faq/greek.html#5|title = FAQ - Greek Language &amp; Script|accessdate = 2013-09-13|publisher = Unicode Consortium|date = 2012-12-03|quote = It is easier to simply equate the two sigma codes for operations which are concerned with word content, for example.}}&lt;/ref&gt; but for typesetting purposes they are distinct and CTL is not required to choose the correct form.

==Implementations==
&lt;!-- Lists in this section are in alphabetical order to avoid POV issues. --&gt;
Most text-rendering software that is capable of CTL will include information about specific scripts, and so will be able to render them correctly without [[computer font|font files]] needing to supply instructions on how to lay out characters. Such software is usually provided in a [[library (computing)|library]]; examples include:
* [[Core Text]] for [[macOS]]
* [[Uniscribe]] (with Universal Shaping Engine) and [[DirectWrite]] for [[Microsoft Windows]]
* [[HarfBuzz]], a [[cross-platform]] library
* [[Pango]], a cross-platform library which nowadays incorporates [[HarfBuzz]]

However, such software is unable to properly render any script for which it lacks instructions, which can include many minority scripts. The alternative approach is to include the rendering instructions in the font file itself. Rendering software still needs to be capable of reading and following the instructions, but this is relatively simple.

Examples of this latter approach include [[Apple Advanced Typography]] (AAT) and [[Graphite (SIL)|Graphite]]. Both of these names encompass both the instruction format and the software supporting it; AAT is included on [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] [[operating system]]s, while Graphite is available for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Linux]]-based systems.

The [[OpenType]] format is primarily intended for systems using the first approach (layout knowledge in the renderer, not the font), but it has a few features that assist with CTL, such as contextual ligatures. AAT and Graphite instructions can be embedded in OpenType font files.

'''Compulsive talking''' (or '''talkaholism''') is talking that goes beyond the bounds of what is considered to be socially acceptable.&lt;ref name="bostrom"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bostrom|first1=Robert N.|last2=Grant Harrington|first2=Nancy|title=An Exploratory Investigation Of Characteristics Of Compulsive Talkers|journal=Communication Education|volume=48 | issue = 1|year=1999|pages=73–80|doi=10.1080/03634529909379154}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main factors in determining if someone is a [[compulsive]] talker are talking in a continuous manner or stopping only when the other person starts talking, and others perceiving their talking as a problem.    Personality traits that have been positively linked to this compulsion include [[assertiveness]], willingness to communicate, self-perceived communication competence, and [[neuroticism]].&lt;ref name="scale"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McCroskey|first1=James C.|last2=Richmond|first2=Virginia P.|title= Identifying Compulsive Communicators: The Talkaholic Scale |journal=Communication Research Reports|volume=10 | issue = 2|year=1993|pages=107–114|doi=10.1080/08824099309359924}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have shown that most people who are talkaholics are aware of the amount of talking they do, are unable to stop, or do not see it as a problem.&lt;ref name="walther"&gt;{{cite web| last = Walther | first = Joseph B.| title = Communication Addiction Disorder: Concern over Media, Behavior and Effects | publisher =Psych Central | date = Aug 1999| url = http://psychcentral.com/lib/2006/communication-addiction-disorder-concern-over-media-behavior-and-effects | accessdate = 21 Oct 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
It has been suggested, through research done by Dr. James C. McCroskey and Dr. Virginia P. Richmond, that United States society finds talkativeness attractive.&lt;ref name="correlates"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McCroskey|first1=James C.|last2=Richmond|first2=Virginia P.|title= Correlates of Compulsive Communication: Quantitative and Qualitative Characteristics |journal=Communican Quarterly|volume=43 | issue = 1|year=1995|page=39|doi=10.1080/01463379509369954}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is something which is rewarded and positively correlated with leadership and influence.&lt;ref name=bostrom/&gt; However, those who compulsively talk are not to be confused with those who are simply highly verbal and vary their quantity of talk. Compulsive talkers are those who are highly verbal in a manner that varies greatly from the norm and is not in the person’s best interest.&lt;ref name=scale/&gt; Those who have been characterized as compulsive talkers talk with a greater frequency, dominate conversations, and are less inhibited than others.&lt;ref name=bostrom/&gt;  They have also been found to be more argumentative and have a positive attitude regarding communication.&lt;ref name=bostrom/&gt; Tendencies towards compulsive talking also are more frequently seen in the personality structure of neurotic psychotic extraverts.&lt;ref name="bigthree"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McCroskey|first1=James C.|last2=Heisel|first2=Alan D.|last3=Richmond|first3=Virginia P.|title= Eysenck's BIG THREE And Communication Traits: Three Correlational Studies|journal=Communication Monographs|volume=68 | issue = 4|year=2001|page=360|doi=10.1080/03637750128068}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been found that talkaholics are never behaviorally shy.&lt;ref name="correlates"/&gt;

==Talkaholic scale==
In 1993 James C. McCroskey and Virginia P. Richmond constructed the Talkaholic Scale, a Likert-type model, to help identify those who are compulsive talkers.  A score of 40 or above, which indicates two standard deviations above the norm, would signal someone to be a true talkaholic.&lt;ref name=scale/&gt;

===Cultural similarities===
A study done in 1995 of 811 university students in the United States found 5.2% of that population had results indicating they were talkaholics. A similar study from the same year with students from New Zealand found similar results, with 4.7% scoring above 40.&lt;ref name="newzealand"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hackman|first1=Michael Z.|last2=Barthel-Hackman|first2=Tam|last3=Johnson|first3=Craig E.|title= Correlates Of Talkaholism In New Zealand: An Intracultural Analysis Of The Compulsive Communication Construct |journal=Communication Research Reports|volume=12 | issue = 1|year=1995|page=5360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences and management==
Compulsive talking can drive people away, which in turn can leave that person with no social support.&lt;ref name="Chillot"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chillot|first1=Rick |title=Do you talk too much? |journal=Prevention |volume=49.10|year=1997|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interrupting, another act that is associated with talkaholics, can signal to other people a lack of respect.&lt;ref name=Chillot/&gt;

According to [[Elizabeth Wagele]], an author of best-selling books on personality types, there are different ways to handle compulsive talkers.  Such coping techniques include changing the focus of the conversation, taking attention away from the talkaholic, leaving the conversation, and creating a distraction.&lt;ref name="wagele"&gt;{{cite web| last = Wagele | first = Elizabeth| title = The Career Within You. Nine Ways to Cope with Talkaholics. | publisher =Sussex Publishers| date = 21 Dec 2010 | url = http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-career-within-you/201012/nine-ways-cope-talkaholic| accessdate = 21 Oct 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Original research|date=October 2012}}

In [[social science]] generally and [[linguistics]] specifically, the '''cooperative principle''' describes how effective communication in [[conversation]] is achieved in common social situations, that is, how listeners and speakers must act cooperatively and mutually accept one another to be understood in a particular way. As phrased by [[Paul Grice]], who introduced it, "Make your contribution such as is required, at the stage at which it occurs, by the accepted purpose or direction of the talk exchange in which you are engaged."&lt;ref name="grice"&gt;{{cite book|last= Grice|first= Paul|year=1975|chapter=Logic and conversation |title=Syntax and semantics|volume=3: Speech acts |pages=41–58 |editor1-last=Cole|editor1-first=P.|editor2-last=Morgan |editor2-first=J. |publisher=Academic Press |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though phrased as a [[Linguistic prescription|prescriptive]] command, the principle is intended as a [[Linguistic description|description]] of how people normally behave in conversation. Jeffries and McIntyre describe Grice's maxims as "encapsulating the assumptions that we prototypically hold when we engage in conversation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jeffries|first1=Lesley|last2=McIntyre|first2=Daniel|title=Stylistics|date=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cooperative principle can be divided into four maxims, called the Gricean maxims, describing specific rational principles observed by people who obey the cooperative principle; these principles enable effective communication.&lt;ref name=Kordic&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kordić, Snježana |authorlink=Snježana Kordić |title=Konverzacijske implikature |trans-title=Conversational implicatures |url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/446883.KONVERZACIJSKE_IMPLIKATURE.PDF |language=Serbo-Croatian |journal=Suvremena lingvistika |volume=17 |issue=31-32 |page=89 |year=1991 |issn=0586-0296 |oclc=440780341 |id={{ZDB|429609-6}} |archivedate=2 September 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ANNqArFh?url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/446883.KONVERZACIJSKE_IMPLIKATURE.PDF |accessdate=9 February 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Grice proposed four conversational maxims that arise from the [[pragmatics]] of natural [[language]].&lt;ref name=Kordic/&gt; Applying the Gricean maxims is a way to explain the link between utterances and what is understood from them.

==Obeying the cooperative principle==
{{cns|text=Those who obey the cooperative principle in their language use will make sure that what they say in a conversation furthers the purpose of that conversation.|date=January 2018}}

{{cns|text=The cooperative principle goes both ways: speakers observe the cooperative principle, and listeners assume that speakers are observing it. This allows for the possibility of ''[[implicature]]s'', which are meanings that are not explicitly conveyed in what is said, but that can nonetheless be inferred.|date=January 2018}}

==Grice's maxims==

===Maxim of quality===
====Supermaxim:====
* ''Try to make your contribution one that is true.''

==== Submaxims: ====
# Do not say what you believe to be false.
# Do not say that for which you lack adequate [[evidence]].&lt;ref&gt;For arguments that Grice's maxim is best understood in terms of knowledge, see {{cite journal |last1=Benton |first1=Matthew A. |title=Gricean Quality |journal=Nous |date=2016 |volume=50 |issue=4 |pages=689-703 |doi=10.1111/nous.12065 |url=https://doi.org/10.1111/nous.12065 |accessdate=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maxim of quantity===
# Make your contribution as informative as is required (for the current purposes of the exchange).
# Do not make your contribution more informative than is required.

===Maxim of relation===
* ''Be relevant.''
With respect to this maxim, Grice writes, "Though the maxim itself is terse, its formulation conceals a number of problems that exercise me a good deal: questions about what different kinds and focuses of relevance there may be, how these shift in the course of a talk exchange, how to allow for the fact that subjects of conversations are legitimately changed, and so on. I find the treatment of such questions exceedingly difficult, and I hope to revert to them in later work."&lt;ref name="grice"/&gt;

===Maxim of manner===
====Supermaxim:====
* ''Be perspicuous.''

==== Submaxims: ====
# Avoid obscurity of expression.
# Avoid ambiguity.
# Be brief (avoid unnecessary [[Verbosity|prolixity]]).
# Be orderly.

==Explanation==
These maxims may also be understood as describing the assumptions listeners normally make about the way speakers will talk, rather than prescriptions for how one ought to talk. Philosopher [[Kent Bach]] writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...[W]e need first to get clear on the character of Grice's maxims. They are not sociological generalizations about speech, nor they are moral prescriptions or proscriptions on what to say or communicate. Although Grice presented them in the form of guidelines for how to communicate successfully, I think they are better construed as presumptions about utterances, presumptions that we as listeners rely on and as speakers exploit (Bach 2005).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gricean maxims generate implicatures. If the overt, surface meaning of a sentence does not seem to be consistent with the Gricean maxims, and yet the circumstances lead us to think that the speaker is nonetheless obeying the cooperative principle, we tend to look for other meanings that could be implied by the sentence.

Grice did not, however, assume that all people should constantly follow these maxims. Instead, he found it interesting when these were not respected, namely either "flouted" (with the listener being expected to be able to understand the message) or "violated" (with the listener being expected to not note this). Flouting would imply some other, hidden meaning. The importance was in what was ''not'' said. For example, answering ''It's raining'' to someone who has suggested playing a game of tennis only disrespects the maxim of relation on the surface; the reasoning behind this "fragment" sentence is normally clear to the interlocutor (the maxim is just "flouted").

==Flouting the maxims==
It is possible to flout a maxim and thereby convey a different meaning than what is literally spoken.&lt;ref name="grice" /&gt; Many times in conversation, this flouting is manipulated by a speaker to produce a negative pragmatic effect, as with [[sarcasm]] or [[irony]]. One can flout the maxim of quality to tell a clumsy friend who has just taken a bad fall that her gracefulness is impressive and obviously intend to mean the complete opposite. Likewise, flouting the maxim of quantity may result in ironic understatement, the maxim of relevance in blame by irrelevant praise, and the maxim of manner in ironic ambiguity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaufer|first=D. S.|year=1981|title=Understanding ironic communication|url=|journal=Journal of Pragmatics|volume=5|pages=495–510|doi=10.1016/0378-2166(81)90015-1|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gricean maxims are therefore often purposefully flouted by [[comedian]]s and writers, who may hide the complete truth and manipulate their words for the effect of the story and the sake of the reader's experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/lexicon_valley/2014/06/20/at_least_ten_ducks_why_this_caption_is_funny_explained_by_gricean_maxims.html|title="Look At All These Ducks There Are At Least Ten." Why Is This Funny?|last1=McCulloch|first1=Gretchen|website=[[Slate (magazine)]]|publisher=[[The Slate Group]]|accessdate=20 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{citation needed span|text=Speakers who deliberately flout the maxims usually intend for their listener to understand their underlying implication. In the case of the clumsy friend, she will most likely understand that the speaker is not truly offering a compliment. Therefore, cooperation is still taking place, but no longer on the literal level. Conversationalists can assume that when speakers intentionally flout a maxim, they still do so with the aim of expressing some thought. Thus, the Gricean maxims serve a purpose both when they are followed and when they are flouted.|date=January 2018}}

==Criticism ==
Grice's theory is often disputed by arguing that cooperative conversation, like most social behaviour, is culturally determined, and therefore the Gricean maxims and the cooperative principle cannot be universally applied due to intercultural differences. Keenan claims that the [[Malagasy people|Malagasy]], for example, follow a completely opposite cooperative principle in order to achieve conversational cooperation. In their culture, speakers are reluctant to share information and flout the maxim of quantity by evading direct questions and replying on incomplete answers because of the risk of losing face by committing oneself to the truth of the information, as well as the fact that having information is a form of prestige.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Keenan |first=Elinor Ochs. |year=1976 |title=On the universality of conversational postulates |journal=Language in Society |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=67–80. |doi=10.1017/s0047404500006850}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Harnish points out&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harnish |first=R. |year=1976 |chapter=Logical form and implicature |title=An Integrated Theory of Linguistic Ability |editor=Bever T G |editor2=Katz J J |editor3=Langendoen, D T |publisher=New York: Crowel.}}&lt;/ref&gt; that Grice only claims his maxims hold in conversations where his cooperative principle is in effect. The Malagasy speakers choose not to be cooperative, valuing the prestige of information ownership more highly. 
(It could also be said in this case that this is a less cooperative communication system, since less information is shared)

Another criticism is that the Gricean maxims can easily be misinterpreted to be a guideline for [[etiquette]], instructing speakers on how to be moral, polite conversationalists. However, the Gricean maxims, despite their wording, are only meant to describe the commonly accepted traits of successful cooperative communication. [[Geoffrey Leech]] introduced the [[politeness maxims]]: tact, [[generosity]], approbation, modesty, [[consensus|agreement]], and [[sympathy]].

A '''Discourse-Completion Task''' (DCT) is a tool used in [[linguistics]] and [[pragmatics]] to elicit particular [[speech acts]].  A DCT consists of a one-sided role play containing a situational prompt which a participant will read to elicit the responses of another participant.

==Background==
The instrument was originally developed by [[Shoshana Blum-Kulka]] for studying speech act realization comparatively between native and non-native Hebrew speakers, based on the work of E. Levenston.&lt;ref name="blum"&gt;Blum-Kulka, S., House, J., &amp; G. Kasper. (1989). Investigating cross-cultural pragmatics: An introductory overview. In Blum-Kulka, S., House, J., &amp; G. Kasper (Eds.), Cross-cultural pragmatics: Requests and apologies (pp. 1-34). Norwood, NJ: Ablex, p. 13-14&lt;/ref&gt;

DCTs are used in pragmatics research to study speech acts and find the medium between naturally occurring speech and scripted speech acts.  In comparing role-plays to DCTs, role-plays are considered to elicit data more similar to naturally occurring speech acts,&lt;ref&gt;Gass, S., &amp; Houck, N. (1999). Interlanguage refusals: a cross-cultural study of Japanese English. Walter de Gruyet, pp. 29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Golato, A. (2003). Studying compliment responses: A comparison of DCTs and recordings of natu-
rally occurring talk. Applied Linguistics, 24(1), 90–121.&lt;/ref&gt; yet are considered harder to score, attributed to the influence of the interlocutors.&lt;ref&gt;Roever, C. (2011). Testing of second language pragmatics: Past and future. Language testing (0265-5322), 28 (4), p. 468&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
A discourse-completion task consists of scripted dialogue representing various scenarios, preceded by a short prompt describing the setting and situation.&lt;ref name="blum" /&gt; The prompt usually includes information on social distance between participants and pre-event background to help the participant construct the scenarios.

'''Divan-khane''' ({{lang-fa|دیوان‌خانه}}) is a [[Persian language|Persian]] phrase from {''[[wiktionary:%D8%AF%DB%8C%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%86#Persian|divan]]'' = court} + {''[[wiktionary:%D8%AE%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%87#Persian|khane]]'' = house} to describe a [[guest house]] usually for prominent people in the [[Middle East]]ern society.

In tribal Middle Eastern, Arab, Persian, and Kurdish societies, a guest house of the tribal chieftain is used mostly for discussing tribal affairs. This served as an institution dedicated to the political and social affairs of the tribe. A ''diwan'' or ''diwan-khane'' was a special room, or house, dedicated to the ''[[Agha (Ottoman Empire)|agha]]'' and his male guests, for sitting and drinking tea, discussing the political and social affairs of the tribe and other mundane subjects. 

The ''agha'' and his guests would also listen to singers and story tellers (usually Jewish merchants or peddlers), who would entertain them. The common ''agha'' was in charge of several major tasks of the tribal society under his jurisdiction: He was the head of the political unit, the [[judge]] and [[arbitrator]], the military leader and the finance minister responsible mainly for receiving dues/taxes from his subjects for their harvest and commercial transactions under his jurisdiction. 

One of the best studies of ''aghas''in the [[Kurd]]ish society is by [[Mordechai Zaken]]: ''Jewish subjects and their tribal chieftains in Kurdistan''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Jewish Subjects and Their Tribal Chieftains in Kurdistan (Jewish Identities in a Changing World) |last=Zaken |first=Mordechai |authorlink=|year=2007 |publisher=BRILL |location= |isbn=90-04-16190-2 |page= |pages=376 |url=https://www.amazon.com/Subjects-Chieftains-Kurdistan-Identities-Changing/dp/9004161902/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top |accessdate=February 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[linguistics]], the '''donor principle''' refers primarily to the observance of the  original spelling of a [[loanword]] from the original ("donor") language. This principle applies in particular to the standardization in the receiver language of [[exonym]]s when they are used in publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.eurogeographics.org/sites/default/files/080205_D5.1_Exonyms%20guidelines%20synopsis.pdf|title= Exonyms guidelines synopsis |date= |website= |publisher= EuroGeoNames|access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Peter Jordan |author2=Milan Orožen Adamič |author3=Paul Woodman |title= Exonyms and the International Standardisation of Geographical Names |url= https://books.google.nl/books?id=NVReAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA11&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;dq=%22exonym%22+%22donor+principle%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xVfZqoTJU5&amp;sig=rdggekWiaLi1VCHjqyswhpCxhN8&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjB-sL0-_LPAhUoDcAKHW02Br0Q6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22exonym%22%20%22donor%20principle%22&amp;f=false|location= |publisher= |page= 11|date= 2007|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term donor principle is sometimes also used for the particular spelling of names of specific products, brands, institutions etc. chosen by their owner, founder, designer, etc., when it clashes with the official spelling rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Dora Sakayan''' ([[classical Armenian orthography]]: {{lang|hy|Դորա Սաքայեան}} {{transl|hy|ISO|Dora Sak'ayean}}; [[Armenian orthography reform|reformed]]: {{lang|hy|Դորա Սաքայան}} {{transl|hy|ISO|Dora Sak'ayan}}; born January 24, 1931), Professor of German Studies (retired), McGill University. Specializing initially as a Germanist, today she is known for her work in various areas of [[Applied Linguistics]]. Sakayan is also noted for pioneering Armenology in Canada, and introducing the two branches of the Armenian language, [[Western Armenian]] and [[Eastern Armenian]], to the English-speaking world.

==Early life, education and career==
Sakayan was born in 1931 in Salonica, Greece, to Armenian parents who had escaped the [[Armenian Genocide]]. She grew up in a multilingual environment, with her first languages being Western Armenian and Modern Greek, and she received early exposure to German, French and Turkish. After immigrating to [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Armenia]], she received her education in Eastern Armenian and Russian. Later on, she mastered English and learned other languages.

Sakayan received her elementary education at the Armenian Gulabi Gulbenkian School in Salonica. She then attended the local German high school Deutsche Schule Saloniki. She was 11&amp;nbsp;years old when her family moved to Vienna, Austria, where she pursued her high school education at the Gymnasium for girls in the 7th District of Vienna "Oberschule für Mädchen, Wien VII."

In 1946, Sakayan’s family repatriated to [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Armenia]] where she completed her secondary education. In 1948, she was admitted to the [[Yerevan State Linguistic University|Yerevan State Pedagogical Institute of Foreign Languages]] (YSPL) where she graduated with a diploma in [[Germanic languages|Germanic linguistics]] and in [[Pedagogy]] in 1952. She was then appointed as an instructor of German at YSPL, where she taught from 1952 to 1956. Subsequently, she was invited to teach in the Department of [[Romance languages|Romance]] and [[Germanic philology|Germanic Philology]] at [[Yerevan State University]] (YSU, 1956–1958).

Sakayan began her graduate studies in Germanic philology in 1958 at the [[Moscow State University|Lomonosov Moscow State University]] (LMSU), completing them in 1961. Over the following four years, she shared her time between Moscow and Yerevan to pursue her teaching duties in Germanic Philology at YSU and complete her PhD thesis while raising her two young children. She obtained her PhD in Germanic Philology from [[Moscow Lomonosov University]] in 1965.

In 1965, Sakayan became Head of the Department of Foreign languages of YSU, a position she held for ten years. At the same time, she delivered lectures in the Department of Romance-Germanic Philology of YSU.

Sakayan immigrated to Canada in January 1975 and began to teach German at two universities: [[McGill University]], (Department of German Studies) and the [[Université de Montréal]] (Department of Études des langues anciennes et modernes). In 1977, she was offered a full-time position at McGill and left Université de Montréal. Due to her high ratings as an instructor of German at McGill, in 1978 she was offered a joint appointment with the Department of Russian and Slavic Studies where she taught for ten years. Over the years, Sakayan rose to the rank of Full Professor at McGill University.

In 1981, Sakayan began her groundbreaking work in [[Armenian studies|Armenian Studies]] at McGill. At the Centre of Continuing Education, she founded and supervised a program of credited Armenian courses anchored in the Department of Russian and Slavic Studies. She edited and prepared for publication a number of Armenological manuscripts of linguistic, literary and historic  interest,&lt;ref&gt;Ed. Sakayan et al. "Sign, System, Communications.

She became a regular participant at international Armenological conferences and congresses,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dorasakayan.org./papers.htm |title=Dora Sakayan |work=Dorasakayan.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and she also organized Armenological conferences in Canada and Armenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dorasakayan.org/confs.htm |title=Dora Sakayan |work=Dorasakayan.com |date=2007-07-11 |accessdate=2014-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seeing her mission as presenting Armenian language and culture to non-Armenians, she founded the series "Armenian Studies for the English Speaking World" and published a number of scholarly books and articles under this heading. To promote the publication of her Armenological books, in 1997 she founded a small press under the name AROD Books in Montreal.

After 25&amp;nbsp;years of service at McGill University, Sakayan retired from the Department of German Studies in 2000 and dedicated herself fully to Armenian Studies. She renewed her ties with Yerevan State University, where she regularly spends a few months every year, participating in scholarly projects, organizing international linguistic conferences, publishing her books with YSU Press and organizing book launches at YSU and elsewhere in Armenia. Among many activities in her homeland, she is the supervisor and participant of an ongoing translation project that she carries out with one of her former students, Evelina Makaryan, a researcher at the Institute for Armenian Studies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.armin.am/en/news |title=Institute for Armenian Studies of YSU |publisher=Armin.am |date= |accessdate=2014-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; at YSU.

At the same time, Sakayan continues the promotion of Armenian Studies in Canada. In 2005, she founded an Armenian language program at the Diocese of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] in Montreal, carrying on a tradition that she established more than three decades ago (in 1981) at the Centre of Continuing Education at McGill University.

==Works==

===Contrastive grammar===
As a Germanist and educator in the East European tradition, Sakayan has received training in Germanic linguistics and [[language pedagogy]]. This background has led her to applied linguistics, and from the great variety of its interdisciplinary branches Sakayan has concentrated on the following areas: a) [[contrastive linguistics]], b) [[foreign language acquisition]], c) [[translation studies]].

Sakayan includes into the contrastive discussion, besides German, other [[Indo-European languages]]: Russian, English, French, and Modern Greek. As an innovation, she also includes Armenian, a non-European language whose [[Agglutination|agglutinative]] properties set it apart from other languages in the Indo-European family. In fact, in Sakayan’s work, contrastive analysis is predominantly based on Armenian, and other languages are viewed through the prism of this language. The objectives of such an endeavor are to establish [[Linguistic typology|language typologies]] and to identify areas of difficulty in foreign language acquisition. Her work also incorporates the findings of Armenian and Russian data — not always accessible to Western linguists.

Sakayan introduces to the Western reader the idiosyncrasies of Eastern Armenian [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] and [[syntax]], with a special focus on the verb system and its rich paradigm of non-finite verb forms, called ''derbays'' (դերբայ = participle). Over the years, she has dealt extensively with East Armenian deverbal [[nominalization]]s, deriving from certain ''derbays'': the Armenian infinitive and three participles: the present, past and the future participle. Within the framework of "Nominalizations of various degrees" Sakayan discusses the regular [[relative clause]] (RC), the ‘relative participles’&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora. "On Armenian Relative Participles and their Access to the AH (Accessibilty Hierarchy)." In: Proceedings of the XVth  [[International Congress of Linguists]], Université Laval, 1992, Quebec: Université Laval Press, 1993, vol. 2, pp. 361-364&lt;/ref&gt; (RP based on the present, past and the future participle), as well and other phenomena of relativization in Eastern Armenian.

Sakayan contrasts Armenian clausal nominalizations with their semantic counterparts in a selective number of European languages. A noteworthy monograph in this respect is ''Formen der Textkohärenz: Nominalisierung als sententiale Anapher im Ostarmenischen''.&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora. Formen der Textkohärenz. Nominalisierung als sententiale Anapher im Ostarmenischen [Forms of text coherence. Nominalization as sentential anaphora in East Armenian], Tübinger Beiträge zur Linguistik, 299 – [Tübingen contributions to Linguistics, Nr. 299], Tübingen: Gunter Narr 1986. {{ISBN|3-87808-299-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This book explores East Armenian clausal nominalizations that are based on the Armenian infinitive. Sakayan describes the transformation process of finite clauses into economical nominal phrases, gives the morphosyntactic characteristics of these nominalizations, identifies the functions of the agglutinative segments in a synthetic nominalized infinitive (SNI).

===Contrastive phraseology===
Sakayan has also taken a keen interest in contrastive [[phraseology]] in the general sense of the term. Recognizing the importance of ready-made expressions in human communication, she has based her research on self-collected linguistic corpora of phraseological units, such as proverbs and sayings, idiomatic expressions, and routine formulae (gambits).

Sakayan has explored the reproduction of routine formulae (gambits) and their role for turn-taking in conversation and for organizing discourse&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora; Tessier, Christine (1983). "Deutsche Gesprächsformeln in Mikrodialogen" [German Speech Formulae in Mini-Dialogues]. Zielsprache Deutsch 1983/3: pp. 9-14.&lt;/ref&gt; She has created thematically and pragmatically grouped bilingual concordances of routine formulae (gambits) for language learning. See the use of such concordances in Sakayan’s textbooks.&lt;ref name="SakayanDora"&gt;Sakayan, Dora. Western Armenian for the English-speaking World. A Contrastive Approach (with CD-ROM). Yerevan State University Press, 2012. {{ISBN|978-5-8084-0890-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora. Eastern Armenian for the English-speaking World. A Contrastive Approach (with CD-ROM). Revised Edition. Yerevan State University Press, 2008. {{ISBN|978-5-8084-0-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sakayan's interest in proverbs resulted in a major [[Paremiology|paremiological]] study accompanied by a bilingual (Armenian-English), thematically arranged anthology of 2,500 proverbs.&lt;ref&gt;Armenian Proverbs: A Paremiological Study with an Anthology of 2,500 Armenian Folk Sayings Selected and Translated into English, Delmar &amp; New York: Caravan Books, First edition: 1994, Second and revised edition: 1995&lt;/ref&gt; An extensive introduction addresses the language and structure,&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora. "On the Grammar of Armenian Proverbs." In: John A. C. Greppin (ed.), Proceedings. Fourth International Conference on Armenian Linguistics. [[Cleveland State University]], Cleveland, September 14–19, 1991, Delmar &amp; New York: Caravan Books, 1992, pp. 171-201&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the origin of Armenian proverbs (international, borrowed and specifically Armenian proverbs).

Contrastive paremiology being an ongoing project, Sakayan’s next volume became a language-pair-oriented paremiological study with special focus on German-Armenian connections and discussions on cross-cultural translatability.&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora. "Ein Freund kann dir das Gesicht weiß oder schwarz machen: Zum Problem der Übersetzbarkeit von Sprichwörtern" [Problems of proverb translatability]. In: Ferdinand van Ingen and Christian Juranek (eds.). Ars et Amicitia, Festschrift für Martin Bircher zum 60. Geburtstag am 3. Juni 1998. Chloe. Beihefte zum Daphnis. Bd. 28. Amsterdam and Atlanta, Rodopi, 1998, pp. 57-73&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora. "On Cross-Cultural Understanding of Language-Specific Notions and Concepts in Folklore." In: Alice Sarkösi (ed.), Festschrift for Edmond Schütz, Budapest: Academy of Sciences Press, 1998, pp. 130-145&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the German counterpart of this paremiological study appeared&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora. Armenische Sprichwörter. Որտեղ հաց, այնտեղ կաց, որտեղ գինի, այնտեղ քնի: Wiesbaden: [[Otto Harrassowitz Verlag]], 2001. {{ISBN|3-447-04379-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a new introduction that provides an in-depth analysis of the structure and language of Armenian proverbs. Along with the extreme conciseness of the Armenian proverbs, Sakayan points to their capacity to function in various sizes and shapes, from extremely short and compact units to more elaborate and wordy structures (e.g. dialogues). Some of them encapsulate people’s everyday talk, citations of reported or direct speech. Since dialogue proverbs or dramatized proverbs are not a universal genre and can be found only in a few languages, Sakayan explores them extensively.&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora. "On Reported and Direct Speech in Proverbs. Dialogue Proverbs in Armenian." In: Proverbium: Yearbook of International Proverb Scholarship, Vol. 16, 1999, pp. 303-324&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign language acquisition===
Sakayan’s scholarly interest in foreign language acquisition is apparent not only in the titles of her published articles, but also in the list of authored and co-authored textbooks, instructional manuals and methodological guides, for the instruction of both German and Armenian as foreign languages&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora. Western Armenian for the English-speaking World. A Contrastive Approach (with CD-ROM). Yerevan State University Press, 2012. {{ISBN|978-5-8084-0890-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora. Eastern Armenian for the English-speaking World. A Contrastive Approach (with CD-ROM). Yerevan State University Press, 2007. {{ISBN|978-5-8084-0890-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora and Christine Tessier. Rede und Antwort. Übungen zum dialogischen Ausdruck. (with cassette) Coauthor: Chr. Tessier. Ismaning: Hueber Verlag, 1989. {{ISBN|3-19-001482-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these projects demonstrate the benefits of applying the latest trends in linguistics to instructional development.&lt;ref&gt;On newer trends in Foreign language teaching. Expectancy Grammar." In: Semiotics and Language Teaching. Theoretical Principles and Practical Applications. Ann Arbor: Caravan Books, 2001, pp. 9-14&lt;/ref&gt;
In the 1960s and 1970s, while chairing the Department of Foreign Languages at Yerevan State University (YSU) in Soviet Armenia, Sakayan authored and co-authored several textbooks, manuals and methodological guides for the instruction of German in Armenian high schools and universities.&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora and Zaruhi Svazlian. Deutsch für die 6. Klasse. (German for the 6th grade of Armenian secondary schools). Coauthor: Z. Svazlian. Yerevan: Louys Press, 1970 (1st ed.), 1972 (2nd ed.), 1973 (3rd ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora and Zaruhi Svazlian. Deutsch für die 5. Klasse (German for the 5th grade of Armenian secondary schools). Yerevan: Louys Press, 1969 (1st ed.), 1971 (2nd ed.), 1973 (3rd ed).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora. Deutsches Lesebuch. [An anthology of German literary]. Yerevan State University Press, 1968 (1st ed.), 1972 (2nd ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora. Lies Deutsch, Erzähl Deutsch! (A reader for Armenian secondary schools with German-Armenian commentary and glossary.) Yerevan: Louys Press, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora. Deutsches Lesebuch. [An anthology of literary texts for graduate students in philology, with German-Armenian commentary and glossary]. Yerevan: University Press, 1967 (1st ed.), 1972 (2nd ed.).&lt;/ref&gt; However, in accordance with Soviet censorship rules that deprived expatriate authors of authorship, the production of all books carrying her name had to be discontinued after Sakayan’s departure to Canada in 1975.

After resettling in Canada, Sakayan continued her research in Foreign Language Methodology. In close collaboration with Professor Christine Tessier of Université Laval in Quebec City, Canada, Sakayan conducted the research project dedicated to German Stereotyped Speech Forms in Mini-Dialogues. Sakayan and Tessier laid the groundwork for a new method of communicative exercises that has received widespread recognition in the area of DaF (Deutsch als Fremdsprache, or German as a Foreign Language). The project resulted in a book called Rede und Antwort,&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora and Christine Tessier. Rede und Antwort. Übungen zum dialogischen Ausdruck. (with cassette) Coauthor: Chr. Tessier. Ismaning: Hueber Verlag, 1989. {{ISBN|3-19-001482-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; widely used as a supplement to other DaF textbooks at universities; in 1991 it was declared in the AOL-Reference Manual as "a hit textbook for DaF."

The innovative method is based on the introduction of German Stereotyped Speech Forms, or gambits, known for their important role in languages while turn-taking in interaction. Gambits used at the beginning of an utterance are seen as cues that signal not only the illocutionary feature of an utterance, but also its syntactic-semantic unfolding. The method broadly applies [[speech act theory]] and [[text linguistics]], as well as some insights of "grammar of expectancy," to the teaching of DaF. The Rede und Antwort exercises have proven to be an effective means for promoting oral skills in the classroom, which are readily applicable in real life-settings.

Inspired by the success of the Rede und Antwort, in the 1990s Sakayan launched and carried out a completely new project: an introductory university textbook for Western Armenian (Western Armenian for the English-speaking World: A Contrastive Approach). The textbook, which first appeared in 2000,&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora. Modern Western Armenian for the English-speaking World. A Contrastive Approach. Montreal: Arod Books, 2000. {{ISBN|0-9699879-2-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; draws on more recent achievements of linguistics in the instruction of Western Armenian. It demonstrates the great potential that contrastive linguistics has for the advancement of foreign language teaching by outlining Armenian-English contrasts throughout the course. It also applies the insights of text linguistics and grammar of expectancy by enhancing the production of correct grammatical forms anticipated by the reproduction of certain ready-made routine formulae. The textbook is conceptualized pragmatically, enabling students to carry out speech acts fundamental for communication. Although grammar receives proper attention, other linguistic aspects such as word formation, semantic vocabulary groups, pronunciation, orthography, etc. are also treated on a regular basis. The textbook was received positively and was adopted by Armenian Studies Programs at universities and schools worldwide.

In 2007, Sakayan published a new Armenian textbook, this time on Eastern Armenian,&lt;ref&gt;Sakayan, Dora. Eastern Armenian for the English-speaking World. A Contrastive Approach (with CD-ROM). Yerevan State University Press, 2007. {{ISBN|978-5-8084-0890-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; also accompanied by a CD-Rom featuring Eastern Armenian native speakers. To bring the level of the existing Western Armenian textbook to that of its Eastern Armenian counterpart, in 2012 Sakayan published a second and revised edition (with CD-Rom).&lt;ref name="SakayanDora" /&gt;

Both titles are now published by YSU Press. They are consistent in methodology and structure, with a vast amount of linguistic material proportionally distributed among 12 Units, which each consist of 12 sections. These twin Armenian textbooks are considered to be the highlight of Sakayan’s career, reflecting a lifetime of pedagogical and scholarly experience in foreign language teaching and research in applied linguistics.

===Armenian genocide===
Sakayan is also a major contributor to the study of the Armenian Genocide. In 1993, she came across the journal of her maternal grandfather, Dr. Garabed Hatcherian, and has since dedicated herself to its publication and dissemination. The journal is a chronicle of the Smyrna catastrophe of 1922, which describes how the ancient port city in Asia Minor was destroyed by a massive fire, whereby the entire Christian population was either massacred or forced to flee. The journal is also a detailed account of the hardship Dr. Hatcherian and his family of eight endured in September 1922. Dr. Hatcherian’s diary is considered to be the most widely translated book about the Armenian Genocide. So far, the journal has appeared in nine languages, three of which were translated by Sakayan, who is also the general editor of all editions. All volumes include a detailed biography of the author, a literary analysis of the journal in an expanded introduction, 52 annotations of an historical and cultural nature, an afterword, and a bibliography. The meticulous editorial work has made ''An Armenian Doctor in Turkey'' a book that has received a highly favorable international reception&lt;ref&gt;[See worldwide reception of Dr. Hatcherian's Diary pp. 175-207] Ed.

Sakayan) ՅՈՒՇԱՐՁԱՆ Ապրիլ 11-ի – MEMORIAL to April 11. Istanbul: Belge International Publishing, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; This book was first compiled and published in Turkish by Theodik in 1919 in Istanbul to pay tribute to the murdered intellectuals and community leaders of 1915—writers, journalists, editors, clergymen, academics, teachers, and jurists.

This latest edition of Theodik’s Hushartsan, published in commemoration of the 95th Anniversary of the Armenian Genocide, is a bilingual production (Armenian and Turkish) with a trilingual introductory section (Armenian, Turkish, and English) dedicated to the memory of [[Hrant Dink]], the Armenian journalist who was murdered in Istanbul in 2007. Also included in this volume is an Armenian and Turkish index of the names of the 761 Armenian martyrs of April 11 (April 24 according to the Gregorian calendar).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.armenianweekly.com/2010/06/08/theodik/ |title=Theodik’s ‘Memorial to April 11′ Republished in Turkey |publisher=Armenian Weekly |date= |accessdate=2014-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Over the last decade, Sakayan has been working on a translation project with one of her former students, Evelina Makaryan, a researcher at the Institute for Armenian Studies at YSU. This project has yielded six books that Sakayan and Makaryan translated from German into Armenian and published with YSU Press. The translations are predominantly eyewitness testimonies of the Armenian Genocide&lt;ref name=Kunzler/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jakob Künzler, Dreissig Jahre Dienst am Orient [Thirty Years of Service in the Orient] Basel 1933, Translated from German into East Armenian by Dora Sakayan and Evelina Makarian (Յակոբ Քյունցլեր, Երեսուն տարի ծառայություն Արևելքում), Yerevan State University Press, 2008. {{ISBN|978-5-8084-1026-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zwei Kriegsjahre in Konstantinopel, Skizzen Deutsch-Jungtürkischer Moral und Politik von Dr. Harry Stuermer, Korrespondent der "Kölnischen Zeitung" In Konstantinopel, 1915–1916, Verlag Payot, Lausanne, 1917. Translation from German into Armenian in progress.]&lt;/ref&gt; that Sakayan has collected from libraries in German-speaking countries.

Sakayan's latest (and most important) work is a book entitled «Man treibt sie in die Wüste»; Clara und Fritz Sigrist-Hilty als Augenzeugen des Völkermordes an den Armeniern 1915–1918 ["They drive them into the desert": Clara and Fritz Sigrist-Hilty as eyewitnesses of the Armenian Genocide 1915-1918] on the writings of Clara Sigrist-Hilty (1884–1988). One day after their church wedding in April 1915, the civil engineer Fritz Sigrist and the nurse Clara Hilty take the train from Werdenberg (Switzerland) and travel through the war zone to South-Eastern Turkey, where Fritz has been working at the construction of the Baghdad railway since 1910. They settle in Keller (today’s Fevzipaşa), a little town on the flank of the Amanus mountains. Shortly after their arrival, the Armenian deportations start and thousands of Armenians walk past their window. For three years the couple has to witness «the lapsing of human lights down there in the steep gorge» while they live their everyday life in their little house on the remote hillside. A visit to Aleppo makes them realize that what they were seeing in Keller on a daily basis was nothing but premeditated death marches. Things deteriorate when the skilled Armenian workers at the Baghdad railway construction site must also join those death marches. Clara feels obliged to record the atrocities, first in her journal, and later in a special eyewitness account. Fritz in his turn writes some important essays on the subject.

Sakayan has deciphered and transcribed the documents written in Gothic handwriting; she has meticulously processed the data and embedded them in the historic events of the time. Moreover, based on a memoir by Haig Aramian, Sakayan recounts the adventurous story of how in June 1916 the couple Sigrist-Hilty helped their Armenian storehouse manager Aramian to escape certain death. The structure of the book presented itself from the available archival materials. The book consists of three parts, each centered around one main character: Clara and Fritz Sigrist-Hilty, and Haig Aramian. Through a thoughtful interplay of primary and secondary texts, Sakayan tells a coherent story of endless human suffering, but also of Christian compassion and selflessness.

===Translations===
At an early stage of her career, Sakayan’s knowledge of languages directed her towards translation and interpretation, and some of her translations were published early on.&lt;ref&gt;Manouk Abeghian (1865–1944) Der armenische Volksglaube [Armenian Folk Beliefs]. Translated from German into East Armenian by Dora Sakayan. In: Collected Works of Manouk Abeghian, Vol. 7.

This furthered her interest in the theoretical aspects of translation. During the Summer semesters between 1981 and 1986, her contact and collaboration with the Translation Department of Saarbrücken University in Germany (Chairman: Dr. Wolfram Wilss) intensified her involvement and productivity in that field and resulted in several articles published in scholarly journals and books, as well as in several papers presented at international conferences.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4864">In the [[philosophy of language]], an '''empty name''' is a [[proper names|proper name]] that has no [[sense and reference|referent]].

The '''problem of empty names''' is that empty names have a meaning that it seems they should not have.  The name "[[Pegasus]]" is empty;&lt;ref&gt;[[W. V. O. Quine]], "[[On What There Is]]" ''The Review of Metaphysics'' '''2'''(5), 1948.&lt;/ref&gt; there is nothing to which it refers. Yet, though there is no Pegasus, we know what the sentence "Pegasus has two wings" means.  We can even understand the sentence "There is no such thing as Pegasus."  But, what can the meaning of a proper name be, except the object to which it refers?

==Overview==
There are three broad ways which philosophers have tried to approach this problem.

# The [[Meaning (linguistic)|meaning]] of a proper name is not the same as the object (if there is any) it refers to.  Hence, though "Pegasus" refers to nothing, it still has a meaning.  The German philosopher [[Gottlob Frege]] seems to have held a theory of this sort.  He says that the sentence "Odysseus was set ashore at Ithaca while sound asleep"  obviously has a sense.  ... the thought [expressed by that sentence] remains the same whether "Odysseus" has reference or not." [[Bertrand Russell]] may also have held a similar theory, that a proper name is a disguised [[definite description]] that signifies some unique characteristic.  If any object has this characteristic feature, the name has a referent.  Otherwise it is empty.  Perhaps "[[Aristotle]]" means "the teacher of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]".  Since there was such a person, "Aristotle" refers to that person.  By contrast, "Pegasus" may mean "the winged horse of [[Bellerophon]]".  Since there was no such horse, the name has no referent.  This is the so-called [[theory of descriptions|description theory of names]]. The difficulty with this account is that we may always use a proper name to deny that the individual bearing the name actually has some characteristic feature.  So, we can meaningfully say that Aristotle was not the teacher of Alexander.  But if "Aristotle" ''means'' "teacher of Alexander", it would follow that this assertion is self-contradictory, which it is not. [[Saul Kripke]] proposed this argument in a series of influential papers in the 1970s. Another difficulty is that different people may have different ideas about the defining characteristics of any individual. Yet we all understand what the name means.  The sole information carried by the name seems to be the [[Identity (philosophy)|identity]] of the individual that it belongs to.  This information therefore cannot be descriptive, it cannot describe the individual.  As [[John Stuart Mill]] argued, a proper name tells us the identity of its bearer, without telling us anything else about it. Naming is rather like ''pointing''.
# A theory that became influential following Kripke's attack is that empty proper names, have, strictly speaking, no meaning.  This is the so-called [[Direct reference|direct-reference]] theory.  Versions of this theory have been defended by [[Keith Donnellan]], [[David Kaplan (philosopher)|David Kaplan]], [[Nathan Salmon]], [[Scott Soames]] and others. The problem with the direct-reference theory is that names appear to be meaningful independently of whether they are empty.  Furthermore, negative existential statements using empty names are both true and apparently meaningful.  How can "Pegasus does not exist" be true if the name "Pegasus", as used in that sentence, has no meaning?
# There are no empty names. All names have a referent. The difficulty with this theory is how to distinguish names like "Pegasus" from names like "Aristotle".  Any coherent account of this distinction seems to require that there are, i.e. there exist, objects that do not exist.  Given that "Pegasus does not exist" is true, it follows that the referent of "Pegasus" does not exist.  Hence there is something&amp;mdash;the referent of "Pegasus"&amp;mdash;that does not exist.
Some philosophers, such as [[Alexius Meinong]] have argued that there are two senses of the verb "exists", exemplified by the sentence "there are things that do not exist".  The first, signified by "there are", is the so-called "wide sense", including Pegasus, the golden mountain, the round square, and so on.  The second, signified by "exist" is the so-called "narrow sense", encompassing only things that are real or existent. The difficulty with this "two sense" theory is that there is no strong evidence that there really are two such distinct senses of the verb "to be".{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

An '''eternal statement''' is a [[:wikt:statement|statement]] whose [[type-token distinction|token instances]] all have the same [[truth value]]. For instance, every inscription or [[utterance]] of the sentence "On July 15, 2009 it rains in Boston" has the same truth value, no matter when or where it is asserted. This type of statement is distinguished from others in that its context will not influence its truth value. Essentially, an eternal statement is a true statement, regardless of how it used.

An '''IETF language tag''' is an abbreviated [[language code]] (for example, ''en'' for English, ''pt-BR'' for Brazilian Portuguese, or ''nan-Hant-TW'' for Min Nan Chinese as spoken in Taiwan using traditional Han characters) defined by the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) in the ''[[Best Current Practice|BCP]] 47'' document series, which is currently composed of normative RFC 5646 (referencing the related RFC 5645) and RFC 4647, along with the normative content of the ''[[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]] Language Subtag Registry''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://r12a.github.io/app-subtags/|title=Language subtag lookup app:|last=|first=|date=|work=r12a.github.io|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=28 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iana.org/assignments/language-tag-extensions-registry&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iana.org/protocols/|title=IANA — Protocol Registries|work=iana.org|accessdate=28 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Components of language tags are drawn from [[ISO 639]], [[ISO 15924]], [[ISO 3166-1]], and [[UN M.49]].

These language tags are used in a number of modern computing standards, including those from the IETF related to the Internet protocols such as [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-3.1.3.1|title=RFC 7231 - Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content|work=ietf.org|accessdate=28 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; those from the [[World Wide Web Consortium]] such as [[HTML]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/dirlang.html#h-8.1|title=Language information and text direction|work=w3.org|accessdate=28 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[XML]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-xml-20081126/#sec-lang-tag|title=Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 (Fifth Edition)|work=w3.org|accessdate=28 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/PNG/#11iTXt|title=Portable Network Graphics (PNG) Specification (Second Edition)|work=w3.org|accessdate=28 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and those from other private standardization bodies such as [[SGML]] or [[Unicode]] (in some of its standard annexes), or from national or regional standard bodies like [[ANSI]] or [[Ecma International|Ecma]] (for example in some of their standards related to computing languages, or bibliographic references and documents classification used in institutional libraries).

== History ==
IETF language tags were first defined in RFC 1766, edited by [[Harald Tveit Alvestrand]], published in March 1995. The tags used ISO 639 two-letter language codes and ISO 3166 two-letter country codes, and allowed registration of whole tags that included variant or script subtags of three to eight letters.

In January 2001 this was updated by RFC 3066, which added the use of ISO 639-2 three-letter codes, permitted subtags with digits, and adopted the concept of language ranges from HTTP/1.1 to help with matching of language tags.

The next revision of the specification came in September 2006 with the publication of RFC 4646 (the main part of the specification), edited by Addison Philips and [[Mark Davis (Unicode)|Mark Davis]] and &lt;nowiki&gt;RFC 4647&lt;/nowiki&gt; (which deals with matching behaviour).  &lt;nowiki&gt;RFC 4646&lt;/nowiki&gt; introduced a more structured format for language tags, added the use of ISO 15924 four-letter script codes and UN M.49 three-digit geographical region codes, and replaced the old registry of tags with a new registry of subtags. The small number of previously defined tags that did not conform to the new structure were grandfathered in order to maintain compatibility with &lt;nowiki&gt;RFC 3066&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

The current version of the specification, RFC 5646, was published in September 2009. The main purpose of this revision was to incorporate three-letter codes from ISO 639-3 and 639-5 into the Language Subtag Registry, in order to increase the interoperability between ISO 639 and BCP 47.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/ltru-charter.html Language Tag Registry Update charter] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070210235400/http://www.ietf.org/html.charters/ltru-charter.html |date=2007-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Syntax of language tags ==
Each language tag is composed of one or more "subtags" separated by hyphens (-). Each subtag is composed of basic Latin letters or digits only.

With the exceptions of private-use language tags beginning with an ''x-'' prefix and grandfathered language tags (including those starting with an ''i-'' prefix and those previously registered in the old Language Tag Registry), subtags occur in the following order:
* A single ''primary language subtag'' based on a two-letter language code from [[ISO 639-1]] (2002) or a three-letter code from [[ISO 639-2]] (1998), [[ISO 639-3]] (2007) or [[ISO 639-5]] (2008), or registered through the BCP 47 process and composed of five to eight letters;
* Up to three optional ''extended language subtags'' composed of three letters each, separated by hyphens; (There is currently no extended language subtag registered in the Language Subtag Registry without an equivalent and preferred primary language subtag. This component of language tags is preserved for backwards compatibility and to allow for future parts of ISO 639.)
* An optional ''script subtag'', based on a four-letter script code from [[ISO 15924]] (usually written in [[Letter_case#Headings_and_publication_titles|Title Case]]);
* An optional ''region subtag'' based on a two-letter country code from [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] (usually written in upper case), or a three-digit code from [[UN M.49]] for geographical regions;
* Optional ''variant subtags'', separated by hyphens, each composed of five to eight letters, or of four characters starting with a digit; (Variant subtags are registered with IANA and not associated with any external standard.)
* Optional ''extension subtags'', separated by hyphens, each composed of a single character, with the exception of the letter ''x'', and a hyphen followed by one or more subtags of two to eight characters each, separated by hyphens;
* An optional ''private-use subtag'', composed of the letter ''x'' and a hyphen followed by subtags of one to eight characters each, separated by hyphens.

Subtags are not [[case-sensitive]], but the specification recommends using the same case as in the Language Subtag Registry, where region subtags are [[UPPERCASE]], script subtags are [[titlecase|Title Case]], and all other subtags are [[lowercase]]. This capitalization follows the recommendations of the underlying ISO standards.

Optional script and region subtags are preferred to be omitted when they add no distinguishing information to a language tag.  For example, ''es'' is preferred over ''es-Latn'', as Spanish is fully expected to be written in the Latin script; ''ja'' is preferred over ''ja-JP'', as Japanese ''as used in Japan'' does not differ markedly from Japanese as used elsewhere.

Not all linguistic regions can be represented with a valid region subtag: the subnational regional dialects of a primary language are registered as variant subtags.  For example, the ''valencia'' variant subtag for the [[Valencian]] dialect of [[Catalan language|Catalan]] is registered in the Language Subtag Registry with the prefix ''ca''.  As this dialect is spoken almost exclusively in Spain, the region subtag ''ES'' can normally be omitted.

IETF language tags have been used as [[locale (computer software)|locale]] identifiers in many applications.  It may be necessary for these applications to establish their own strategy for defining, encoding and matching locales if the strategy described in &lt;nowiki&gt;RFC 4647&lt;/nowiki&gt; is not adequate.

The use, interpretation and matching of IETF language tags is currently defined in &lt;nowiki&gt;RFC 5646&lt;/nowiki&gt; and &lt;nowiki&gt;RFC 4647&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  The Language Subtag Registry lists all currently valid public subtags.  Private-use subtags are not included in the Registry as they are implementation-dependent and subject to private agreements between third parties using them.  These private agreements are out of scope of BCP 47.

== Relation to other standards ==
Although some types of subtags are derived from [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] or [[United Nations|UN]] core standards, they do not follow these standards absolutely, as this could lead to the meaning of language tags changing over time. In particular, a subtag derived from a code assigned by [[ISO 639]], [[ISO 15924]], [[ISO 3166]], or [[UN M.49]] remains a valid (though deprecated) subtag even if the code is withdrawn from the corresponding core standard. If the standard later assigns a new meaning to the withdrawn code, the corresponding subtag will still retain its old meaning.

This stability was introduced in RFC 4646.

=== ISO 639-3 and ISO 639-1 ===
RFC 4646 defined the concept of an "extended language subtag" (sometimes referred to as ''extlang''), although no such subtags were registered at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-ltru-4646bis

|accessdate=2008-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RFC 5645 and RFC 5646 added primary language subtags corresponding to [[ISO 639-3]] codes for all languages that did not already exist in the Registry. In addition, codes for languages encompassed by certain macrolanguages were registered as extended language subtags. Sign languages were also registered as extlangs, with the prefix ''sgn''. These languages may be represented either with the subtag for the encompassed language alone (''cmn'' for Mandarin) or with a language-extlang combination (''zh-cmn''). The first option is preferred for most purposes. The second option is called "extlang form" and is new in RFC 5646.

Whole tags that were registered prior to RFC 4646 and are now classified as "grandfathered" or "redundant" (depending on whether they fit the new syntax) are deprecated in favor of the corresponding ISO 639-3–based language subtag, if one exists. To list a few examples, ''nan'' is preferred over ''zh-min-nan'' for [[Min Nan]] Chinese; ''hak'' is preferred over ''i-hak'' and ''zh-hakka'' for [[Hakka Chinese]]; and ''ase'' is preferred over ''sgn-US'' for [[American Sign Language]].

=== ISO 639-5 and ISO 639-2 ===
[[ISO 639-5]] defines language collections with alpha-3 codes in a different way than they were initially encoded in ISO 639-2 (including one code already present in ISO 639-1). Specifically, the language collections are now all defined in ISO 639-5 as inclusive, rather than some of them being defined exclusively. This means that language collections have a broader scope than before, in some cases where they could encompass languages that were already encoded separately within ISO 639-2.

For example, the ISO 639-2 code ''afa'' was previously associated with the name "Afro-Asiatic (Other)", excluding languages such as Arabic that already had their own code. In ISO 639-5, this collection is named "Afro-Asiatic languages" and includes all such languages. ISO 639-2 changed the exclusive names in 2009 to match the inclusive ISO 639-5 names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_changes.php|title=ISO 639-2 Language Code List - Codes for the representation of names of languages (Library of Congress)|work=loc.gov|accessdate=28 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To avoid breaking implementations that may still depend on the older (exclusive) definition of these collections, ISO 639-5 defines a grouping type attribute for all collections that were already encoded in ISO 639-2 (such grouping type is not defined for the new collections added only in ISO 639-5).

BCP 47 defines a "Scope" property to identify subtags for language collections. However, it does not define any given collection as inclusive or exclusive, and does not use the ISO 639-5 grouping type attribute, although the description fields in the Language Subtag Registry for these subtags match the ISO 639-5 (inclusive) names. As a consequence, BCP 47 language tags that include a primary language subtag for a collection may be ambiguous as to whether the collection is intended to be inclusive or exclusive.

ISO 639-5 does not define precisely which languages are members of these collections; only the hierarchical classification of collections is defined, using the inclusive definition of these collections. Because of this, RFC 5646 does not recommend the use of subtags for language collections for most applications, although they are still preferred over subtags whose meaning is even less specific, such as "Multiple languages" and "Undetermined".

In contrast, the classification of individual languages within their macrolanguage is standardized, in both ISO 639-3 and the Language Subtag Registry.

=== ISO 15924, ISO/IEC 10646 and Unicode ===
Script subtags were first added to the Language Subtag Registry when RFC 4646 was published, from the list of codes defined in [[ISO 15924]]. They are encoded in the language tag after primary and extended language subtags, but before other types of subtag, including region and variant subtags.

Some primary language subtags are defined with a property named "Suppress-Script" which indicates the cases where a single script can usually be assumed by default for the language, even if it can be written with another script. When this is the case, it is preferable to omit the script subtag, to improve the likelihood of successful matching. A different script subtag can still be appended to make the distinction when necessary. For example, ''yi'' is preferred over ''yi-Hebr'' in most contexts, because the Hebrew script subtag is assumed for the [[Yiddish]] language.

As another example, ''zh-Hans-SG'' may be considered equivalent to ''zh-Hans'', because the region code is probably not significant; the written form of Chinese used in Singapore uses the same simplified Chinese characters as in other countries where Chinese is written. However, the script subtag is maintained because it is significant.

Note that ISO 15924 includes some codes for script variants (for example, ''Hans'' and ''Hant'' for simplified and traditional forms of Chinese characters) that are unified within [[Unicode]] and [[ISO/IEC 10646]]. These script variants are most often encoded for bibliographic purposes, but are not always significant from a linguistic point of view (for example, ''Latf'' and ''Latg'' script codes for the Fraktur and Gaelic variants of the Latin script, which are mostly encoded with regular Latin letters in Unicode and ISO/IEC 10646). They may occasionally be useful in language tags to expose orthographic or semantic differences, with different analysis of letters, diacritics, and digraphs/trigraphs as default grapheme clusters, or differences in letter casing rules.

=== ISO 3166-1 and UN M.49 ===
{{Further|Country code top-level domain#Historical ccTLDs}}

Two-letter region subtags are based on codes assigned, or "exceptionally reserved", in [[ISO 3166-1]]. If the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency were to reassign a code that had previously been assigned to a different country, the existing BCP 47 subtag corresponding to that code would retain its meaning, and a new region subtag based on [[UN M.49]] would be registered for the new country. UN M.49 is also the source for numeric region subtags for geographical regions, such as &lt;code&gt;005&lt;/code&gt; for South America.

Region subtags are used to specify the variety of a language "as used in" a particular region. They are appropriate when the variety is regional in nature, and can be captured adequately by identifying the countries involved, as when distinguishing [[British English]] (''en-GB'') from [[American English]] (''en-US''). When the difference is one of script or script variety, as for [[Simplified Chinese characters|simplified]] versus [[Traditional Chinese characters|traditional]] Chinese characters, it should be expressed with a script subtag instead of a region subtag; in this example, ''zh-Hans'' and ''zh-Hant'' should be used instead of ''zh-CN'' and ''zh-HK''.

When a distinct language subtag exists for a language that could be considered a regional variety, it is often preferable to use the more specific subtag instead of a language-region combination. For example, ''ar-DZ'' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]] as used in [[Algeria]]) may be better expressed as ''arq'' for [[Algerian Arabic|Algerian Spoken Arabic]].

== Extensions ==
''Extension subtags'' (not to be confused with ''extended language subtags'') allow additional information to be attached to a language tag that does not necessarily serve to identify a language. One use for extensions is to encode locale information, such as calendar and currency.

Extension subtags are composed of multiple hyphen-separated character strings, starting with a single character (other than ''x''), called a ''singleton''. Each extension is described in its own [[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] [[Request for Comments|RFC]], which identifies a Registration Authority to manage the data for that extension. [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]] is responsible for allocating singletons.

Two extensions have been assigned as of January 2014.

=== Extension T (Transformed Content) ===
Extension T allows a language tag to include information on how the tagged data was transliterated, transcribed, or otherwise transformed. For example, the tag ''en-t-jp'' could be used for content in English that was translated from the original Japanese. Additional substrings could indicate that the translation was done mechanically, or in accordance with a published standard.

Extension T is described in RFC 6497, published in February 2012. The Registration Authority is the [[Unicode Consortium]].

=== Extension U (Unicode Locale) ===
Extension U allows a wide variety of locale attributes found in the [[Common Locale Data Repository]] (CLDR) to be embedded in language tags. These attributes include calendar and time zone data, collation order, currency, number system, and keyboard identification. Tags containing a ''u-'' extension are more likely to be used to identify locale data sets than for purely linguistic content.

Some examples include:
* ''ar-u-nu-latn'' represents Arabic-language content using [[Arabic numerals|Basic Latin digits]] (0 through 9) instead of [[Eastern Arabic numerals|Arabic-script digits]] (٠ through ٩).
* ''he-IL-u-ca-hebrew-tz-jeruslm'' represents Hebrew as spoken in Israel, using the traditional [[Hebrew calendar]], and in the "Asia/Jerusalem" time zone as identified in the [[tz database]].

Extension U is described in RFC 6067, published in December 2010. The Registration Authority is the [[Unicode Consortium]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1744">'''Koalang''' is a term coined by [[Janusz A. Zajdel]], a Polish [[science fiction]] writer. It is a language used by people in a totalitarian world called ''[[Paradyzja]]'' in his 1984 novel of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wyborcza.pl/1,75248,2459055.html "Sztuczne języki przeżywają renesans"], ''[[Gazeta Wyborcza]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The "''ko-al''" in "''koalang''" derives from the Polish words ''''kojarzeniowo-aluzyjny'''' ("associative-allusive").&lt;ref name=nk&gt;[http://www.mbp.lublin.pl/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1138&amp;Itemid=1&amp;limit=1&amp;limitstart=9 "Noc Kultury 2009"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Because Paradyzja is a [[space station]], and activity is tracked by automatic cameras and analysed, mostly, by computers, its people created an [[Aesopian language]], which is full of [[metaphor]]s that are impossible for computers to grasp. The meaning of every sentence depended on the context. For example, "I dreamt about blue angels last night" means "I was visited by the police last night."

The software that analyzes sentences is [[machine learning|self-learning]]. Thus, a phrase that is used to describe something metaphorically should not be used again in the same context.

Zajdel paid a tribute to [[George Orwell]]'s [[newspeak]] and to [[Aldous Huxley]], by naming one of the main characters ''Nikor Orley Huxwell''.

In the 1980s, the youth magazine ''[[Na Przełaj]]'' (Short Cut) printed [[rock music|rock]] lyrics in a column titled ''KOALANG'', hinting that the songs' texts contained content camouflaged from [[censorship]].&lt;ref name=nk/&gt;

The '''languages of Palestine''' are the languages spoken or once spoken in the territory of the [[State of Palestine]].

==Overview==
[[Palestinian Arabic]] is the primary language spoken by Palestinians and has a unique dialect. A Levantine Arabic dialect subgroup, it is spoken in Palestine by [[Arab citizens of Israel]] (mostly Palestinians) and in most Palestinian populations around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of the Stateless Nations: L-R - Page 1492, James Minahan - 2002&lt;/ref&gt; However, Palestinian refugees in other parts of the world may have a different dialect from Palestinian Arabic. In the West Bank, there are many Israeli settlements in which, since the early 20th century, Hebrew has become more common. However, [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Amharic]] has also started to appear resulting from aliyah from Ethiopia. Other Jewish migrants have also brought other European languages.&lt;ref&gt;Struggle and Survival in Palestine/Israel - Page 403, Gershon Shafir - 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In premodern and medieval time periods, many other languages had also been spoken in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] for ceremonial purposes or otherwise, including [[Latin]] and other [[Italic languages]] as well as [[French language|French]], [[Germanic languages]], [[Classical Arabic]] and [[Greek language|Greek]]. However, they gradually faded away along with geopolitical shifts and the end of feudalism.&lt;ref&gt;''Naming Patterns in the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem'', p. 42, Iris Shagrir - 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''linguistic turn''' was a major development in [[Western philosophy]] during the early 20th century, the most important characteristic of which is the focusing of [[philosophy]] and the other [[humanities]] primarily on the relationship between philosophy and [[language]].

Very different intellectual movements were associated with the "linguistic turn", although the term itself is commonly thought popularised by [[Richard Rorty]]'s 1967 anthology ''The Linguistic Turn'', in which it means the turn towards [[linguistic philosophy]]. According to Rorty, who later dissociated himself from linguistic philosophy and analytic philosophy generally, the phrase "the linguistic turn" originated with philosopher [[Gustav Bergmann]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Rorty]], "Wittgenstein, Heidegger, and the Reification of Language" in Richard Rorty, ''Essays on Heidegger and Others: Philosophical Papers'', Cambridge University Press, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neil Gross, ''Richard Rorty: The Making of an American Philosopher'', University Of Chicago Press, 2008, p. xxix.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analytic philosophy==
Traditionally, the linguistic turn is taken to also mean the birth of [[analytic philosophy]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/38153975|title=Origins of analytical philosophy|last=Dummett|first=Michael A.|date=|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=|isbn=0674644735|location=Cambridge. Mass.|pages=5|oclc=38153975}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the results of the linguistic turn was an increasing focus on [[logic]] and [[philosophy of language]], and the cleavage between [[Linguistic philosophy|ideal language philosophy]] and [[ordinary language philosophy]].

===Frege===
According to [[Michael Dummett]], the linguistic turn can be dated to [[Gottlob Frege]]'s 1884 work ''[[The Foundations of Arithmetic]]'', specifically paragraph 62 where Frege explores the identity of a numerical proposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/lang-phi/#SH1b|title=Language, Philosophy of – Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|author=|date=|website=www.iep.utm.edu|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Dummett, "Frege: Philosophy of Mathematics"&lt;/ref&gt; 

In order to answer a [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] question about [[Number|numbers]], "How are numbers given to us, granted that we have no idea or intuition of them?" Frege invokes his "[[context principle]]", stated at the beginning of the book, that only in the context of a proposition do words have meaning, and thus finds the solution to be in defining "the sense of a proposition in which a number word occurs." Thus an [[Ontology|ontological]] and [[Epistemology|epistemological]] problem, traditionally solved along [[Idealism|idealist]] lines, is instead solved along [[Linguistics|linguistic]] ones.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Russell and Wittgenstein===
This concern for the logic of propositions and their relationship to "facts" was later taken up by the notable analytic philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]] in "[[On Denoting]]", and played a weighty role in his early work in [[logical atomism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hist-analytic.com/RussellLAfacts.pdf The Philosophy of Physical Atomism], p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], an associate of Russell, was one of the progenitors of the linguistic turn. This follows from his ideas in his ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'' that philosophical problems arise from a misunderstanding of the logic of language, and from his remarks on [[Language game (philosophy)|language games]] in his later work. His later work (specifically ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'') significantly departs from the common tenets of analytic philosophy and might be viewed as having some resonance in the post-structuralist tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Although Wittgenstein never used the term Linguistic turn. See  [http://info.sjc.ox.ac.uk/scr/hacker/docs/Beyond%20the%20linguistic%20turn%20.pdf Analytic Philosophy: Beyond the Linguistic Turn and Back Again] (St. Johns College website)&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Quine and Kripke===
[[W. V. O. Quine]] describes the historical continuity of the linguistic turn with earlier philosophy in [[Two Dogmas of Empiricism|''Two Dogmas of Empiricism'']]: "[[Intension|Meaning]] is what [[essence]] becomes when it is divorced from the object of reference and wedded to the word."&lt;ref&gt;Quine, W. V. O. ''Two Dogmas of Empiricism''&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the twentieth century, philosophers like [[Saul Kripke]] in ''[[Naming and Necessity]]'' drew metaphysical conclusions from closely analyzing language.&lt;ref name="Garrett2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian Garrett|title=What Is This Thing Called Metaphysics?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qTmJrtBX-ZkC&amp;pg=PA54|date=25 February 2011|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-136-79269-4|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Continental philosophy ==
Decisive for the linguistic turn in the humanities were the works of yet another tradition, namely the [[Continental philosophy|Continental]] [[structuralism]] of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]. Structuralism was the initial outcome of Saussure's linguistic turn, which later led to [[poststructuralism]] with the input of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s ideas.&lt;ref&gt;David Kreps, ''Bergson, Complexity and Creative Emergence'', Springer, 2015, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; Influential poststructuralist theorists include [[Judith Butler]], [[Luce Irigaray]], [[Julia Kristeva]], [[Gilles Deleuze]], [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Jacques Derrida]]. The power of language, more specifically of certain rhetorical tropes, in historical discourse was explored by [[Hayden White]].

These various movements often lead to the notion that language 'constitutes' reality, a position contrary to intuition and to most of the Western tradition of philosophy. The traditional view (what Derrida called the 'metaphysical' core of Western thought) saw words as functioning labels attached to concepts.  According to this view, there is something like 'the ''real'' chair', which exists in some external reality and corresponds roughly with a concept in human thought, ''chair'', to which the linguistic word "chair" refers. However, the founder of structuralism, Ferdinand de Saussure, held that definitions of concepts cannot exist independently from a linguistic system defined by difference, or, to put it differently, that a concept of something cannot exist without being named. Thus differences between meanings structure our perception; there is no ''real'' chair except insofar as we are manipulating symbolic systems. We would not even be able to recognize a chair ''as'' a chair without simultaneously recognising that a chair is ''not'' everything else - in other words a chair is defined as being a specific collection of characteristics which are themselves defined in certain ways, and so on, and all of this within the symbolic system of language. Thus, a large part of what we think of as ''reality'' is really a convention of naming and characterising, a convention which is itself called ''language''.

'''Linguistics in education''' refers to a small but growing field of [[linguistics]] which advocates a greater use of linguistic theory and {{clarify span|linguistic curriculum|date=May 2014}} in [[Primary education|primary]] and [[Secondary education|secondary]] [[education]].

== Background ==
Due to changes in national standards for K-12 education in the [[United States]] during the 1960s, [[grammar]] was largely dropped from [[English studies|English]] courses. The belief was that direct grammar instruction was not required for improved instruction in writing. Despite more recent research that has shown the positive effects of grammar instruction,{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} the attitude that it is unnecessary persists today.

== Challenges ==
Because grammar has not been taught in many years, generations of teachers were never exposed to its direct instruction. Thus, even though many wish to teach it in their classrooms they do not find that they have adequate knowledge on the subject. Unfortunately this often perpetuates [[Folk etymology|linguistic stereotypes]] that can sometimes be discriminatory to speakers on what are believed to be non standard dialects or languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/exchange/node/4564 |title=Should We Teach Grammar in the Upper Elementary School Classroom ? &amp;#124; Serendip Studio |publisher=Serendip.brynmawr.edu |date=2010-01-31 |accessdate=2015-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another issue is that the curriculum for teachers is already very broad, especially in comparison to other college students, so requiring further courses for would-be teachers is rather unpopular. The same problem exists in the K-12 classroom which already have difficult time constraints on their current curriculum. To add grammar to an already full curriculum is extremely difficult.

== Benefits ==
Studies of how grammar and other linguistic theory can be incorporated into K-12 classrooms have been highly successful both in improving students' conscious knowledge of grammar and changing attitudes about non-standard English dialects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2004/11/05/loc_dialect.html |title=Speech modes not right or wrong, just different |publisher=Enquirer.com |date=2004-11-05 |accessdate=2015-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that grammar instruction can be beneficial to students' writing such that replacing writing or vocabulary instruction with grammar can actually be a more productive use of class time.

== Current theory ==
Linguists have also been involved in this field in attempts to change [[Folk etymology|misconceptions about language]]. One common example is the definition of [[nouns]]. Traditionally a noun is defined as a "person, place, or thing". While this definition captures much of what nouns are it does not incorporate all possible definitions and uses. For example, mental concepts such as "belief" or "idea" are also nouns but do not neatly fit the traditional definition. This can be especially difficult for children to understand. A more comprehensive definition seeks to describe nouns through their features and uses. However this definition requires the teacher to have greater knowledge of English [[syntax]].

Palgrave Macmillan, 2012, {{ISBN|978-023032-141-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Municipalities that make use of the 3,000-speaker rule include the national capital [[Helsinki]] and the cultural center of Swedish Finns, [[Turku]]. On the [[Åland]] archipelago, where Finnish is almost absent from daily life, the language law does not apply. On the mainland, the highest proportion of Swedish-speakers is found on the western coast, in [[Ostrobothnia (region)|Ostrobothnia]].&lt;ref&gt;Claus D.

Of the 317 [[Municipalities of Finland|Finnish municipalities]], 16 are monolingually Swedish. 33 municipalities are bilingually Finnish and Swedish; of these, 15 have a Swedish-speaking majority and 18 a Finnish-speaking one.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/sv/laki/ajantasa/2013/20130053]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ruotsin"/&gt; Four municipalities, all located in [[Lapland (Finland)|Lapland]], have a Finnish-speaking majority and a Sami-speaking minority: [[Enontekiö]], [[Inari, Finland|Inari]], [[Sodankylä]] and [[Utsjoki]].&lt;ref name="luoma"&gt;Kenneth Douglas McRae, Mika Helander, Sari Luoma, ''Conflict and Compromise in Multilingual Societies: Finland, Volume 3'', p. 231.

The '''Lithuanian press ban''' ({{lang-lt|spaudos draudimas}}) was a ban on all [[Lithuanian language]] publications printed in the [[Latin alphabet]] in force from 1865 to 1904 within the [[Russian Empire]], which controlled [[Lithuania]] at the time.  Lithuanian-language publications that used [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] were allowed and even encouraged. 

The concept arose after the failed [[January Uprising]] of 1863, taking the form of an administrative order in 1864, and was not lifted until 26 April 1904. The Russian courts reversed two convictions in press ban cases in 1902 and 1903, and the setbacks of the [[Russo-Japanese War]] in early 1904 brought about a loosened Russian policy towards minorities.&lt;ref name=LTR_en&gt;[http://www.spaudos.lt/Istorija/Lithuanian_Resistance.en.htm Lithuanian Resistance].

Under the ban, it was illegal to print, import, distribute, or possess any publications in the Latin alphabet.&lt;ref name=lituanus3&gt;[http://www.lituanus.org/1996/96_3_03.htm Lithuania 1863-1893: Tsarist Russification And The Beginnings Of The Modern Lithuanian National Movement].

Retrieved on 2009-03-17&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tsar]]ist authorities hoped that this measure, part of a larger [[Russification]] plan, would decrease Polish influence on Lithuanians and would return them to what were considered their ancient historical ties with Russia.&lt;ref name=geras/&gt; However, Lithuanians organized printing outside the Empire, largely in [[Lithuania Minor]] ([[East Prussia]]), and in the United States. 

[[Knygnešiai]] (Lithuanian book smugglers) smuggled illegal books and periodicals across the border. The number of such publications kept increasing despite strict sanctions and persecution of the activists. The ban created a well-defined and organized opposition to Russian rule and culture—the opposite of its original intent. The Lithuanian historian [[Edvardas Gudavičius]] has described the ban as a test of the concept of Lithuania: had there been no resistance, the language would have become a historical footnote, and the modern nation would never have been created.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lfpr.lt/uploads/File/1999-4/Gudavicius.pdf The Year 2000: History and Contemporary Experience] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927162352/http://www.lfpr.lt/uploads/File/1999-4/Gudavicius.pdf |date=2007-09-27 }}.

==Background==
[[File:Mazvydo katekizmas.jpg|right|150 px|thumb|[[Catechism of Martynas Mažvydas]] published in 1547]]
The first book published in print in the Lithuanian language was [[Lutheran]] [[Catechism of Martynas Mažvydas]] in 1547. Other milestone publications included [[Daniel Klein (grammarian)|Daniel Klein]]'s ''Grammar'' in 1653, a publication of the [[Bible]] in 1735, and the first work of imaginative literature, [[Kristijonas Donelaitis]]' ''Metai'' ([[The Seasons (poem)|The Seasons]]), in 1818.  During the years of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], which lasted from 1569 to 1781, the [[Polish language]] gained ground as the written ''[[lingua franca]]'' of greater Lithuania, although the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] areas of [[Lithuania Minor]] continued to issue publications in Lithuanian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channelviewpublications.net/cilp/003/0062/cilp0030062.pdf Locating Lithuanian in the (Re-) Intellectualisation Debate]. channelviewpublications.net.

At the beginning of the 19th century, use of the [[Lithuanian language]] was largely limited to Lithuanian rural areas, apart from its use in Prussia; it was, however, retained by some members of the minor nobility, especially in the [[Samogitia]]n region. Several factors contributed to its subsequent revival: the language drew attention from scholars of the emerging science of [[comparative linguistics]]; after the [[Emancipation reform of 1861|abolition of serfdom in the Russian Empire in 1861]], [[social mobility]] increased, and Lithuanian intellectuals arose from the ranks of the rural populace; and language became associated with identity in Lithuania, as elsewhere across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lituanus.org/1989/89_4_06.htm The Lithuanian language and nation through the ages: Outline of a history of Lithuanian in its social context] William R.

A closer relationship developed between the educated clergy, who were increasingly of ethnic Lithuanian stock, and their parishioners, including a sympathy with their wish to use the Lithuanian language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lituanus.org/1988/88_3_02.htm Christianity in Lithuania].

According to the [[bibliographer]] [[Vaclovas Biržiška]], between 1800 and 1864, when the press ban was enacted, 926 book titles were published in the Lithuanian language using its Latin alphabet.&lt;ref name=ltword&gt;[http://www.spaudos.lt/LietKalba/Books.en.htm ''Book, in the Lithuanian Language''].

After the [[partitions of Poland|partitions of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in the late 18th century, significant portions of Lithuania and Poland were incorporated into the [[Russian Empire]]. The uprising of 1863, seeking to re-establish the Commonwealth, convinced many Russian politicians that Polish cultural and political influence was the main obstacle hindering the Russification of Lithuania. They believed that if the Lithuanian peasantry were distanced from the [[Szlachta|Polonized nobility]] and the [[Catholic Church]], Lithuanians would naturally come under Russian cultural influence, as they had allegedly been during previous eras.&lt;ref name=el&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor=Simas Sužiedėlis |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopedia Lituanica]] |title=Press ban |year=1970–1978 |publisher=Juozas Kapočius |volume=IV |location=Boston, Massachusetts |id={{LCC|74-114275}} |pages=342–345 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian politician Nikolai Miliutin wrote that "Russian letters will finish that which was begun with the Russian sword."&lt;ref name=schmalstieg1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lituanus.org/1995_1/95_1_01.htm |title=Baudouin de Courtenay's Contribution to Lithuanian Linguistics |publisher=[[Lituanus]] |year=1995 |author=William R.

On 13 May 1863 Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia]] appointed [[Mikhail Nikolayevich Muravyov-Vilensky|Mikhail Nikolayevich Muravyov]] as the Governor General of the [[Vilna Governorate]].&lt;ref name=miknys/&gt; His duties included both suppression of the uprising, and implementation of the Russification policy. Because the situation was perceived as critical, Muravyov was temporarily granted extremely wide powers.&lt;ref name=le&gt;{{lt icon}} {{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia=Lietuvių enciklopedija | title=Spaudos draudimas | location=Boston, Massachusetts | publisher=Lietuvių enciklopedijos leidykla |year=1963 |volume=28 |pages=334–337 |id={{LCC|55020366}} |url=http://www.spaudos.lt/Istorija/SD_issamiau.htm|accessdate= 2009-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muravyov and [[Ivan Petrovich Kornilov]], the newly appointed director of the [[Vilnius]] educational district, prepared a radical long-term Russification program that became known as the ''Program of Restoration of Russian Beginnings'' ({{lang-lt|Rusų pradų atkūrimo programa}}). Its stated goals were to:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Lietuvos istorija 11–12 klasėms | first=Rūstis |last=Kamuntavičius |author2=Vaida Kamuntavičienė |author3=Remigijus Civinskas |author4=Kastytis Antanaitis  |year=2001 |publisher=Vaga |location=Vilnius |isbn=5-415-01502-7 |pages=303–304|language=lt}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Eliminate the Polish language from public life
# Prevent the employment of Catholics in government institutions
# Control and restrict the Catholic Church
# Create favorable conditions for the spread of [[Eastern Orthodoxy]]
# Replace Lithuanian parish schools with Russian grammar schools
# Encourage ethnic Russians to resettle in Lithuanian lands
# Replace the Latin alphabet with the Cyrillic alphabet
# Ban any Lithuanian-language publications in the Latin alphabet

On 22 May 1864 Tsar Alexander II approved this program.&lt;ref name=miknys&gt;{{cite book| url=http://www.spaudos.lt/Istorija/History_a.en.htm | first=Rimantas |last=Miknys | title=Acquaintance with Lithuania. Book of the Millennium |volume=I |location=Kaunas |publisher=[[Kraštotvarka]] |year=1999 |pages=68–74 |isbn=9986-892-28-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days later Muravyov issued an administrative order that forbade printing Lithuanian language textbooks written in the Latin alphabet. This order was developed into a comprehensive ban on September 6, 1865 by [[Konstantin Petrovich von Kaufman]], Muravyov's successor.&lt;ref name=el/&gt; Kaufman issued an order to six neighboring governorates declaring a full ban on all publications and demanding that censorship committees enforce it without hesitation. A week later the order was extended to the entire Empire by [[Pyotr Valuev]], Minister of the Interior. In 1866 the ban was further extended to include all academic books.&lt;ref name=le/&gt;

Despite its strict and widespread enforcement, none of the ban's supporting measures were ever actually codified into law. The ban was enforced based solely on administrative orders and the tsar's approval.&lt;ref name=le/&gt; When the special temporary powers of the Governor General were revoked in 1871, these administrative orders lost any legal value. From that point on the ban had no legal basis, but it was still strictly enforced.&lt;ref name=le/&gt;

==Enforcement==

At first the Russian authorities encouraged and sponsored the publication of Lithuanian-language works in the Cyrillic alphabet. The idea of replacing the Latin alphabet with Cyrillic was first elaborated by the well-known [[Pan-Slavism|Pan-Slavist]] [[Alexander Hilferding]] in his 1863 book ''Lithuania and Samogitia''.&lt;ref name=el/&gt; &lt;!-- Vasili Kulin, an educational superintendent, argued that the administration should use all its means to support Orthodoxy as well, and that results could be expected within five years.{{Citation needed|date = March 2009}}   --&gt;

The first experiments with the conversion of Lithuanian writings into Cyrillic were conducted by a Lithuanian linguist, [[Jonas Juška]]. He showed some samples of adapted texts to both Muravyov and Kornilov in February 1864.&lt;ref name=el/&gt; However, Juška discontinued his work and Kornilov formed a committee to work on publishing Lithuanian books in Cyrillic. The committee had four members: the Polish librarian [[Stanisław Mikucki]] from [[Warsaw]], Russian Jonas Kerčinskis, a Lithuanian [[Catholic]] priest who had converted to [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], Antanas Petkevičius, and the well-known Lithuanian educator and publisher [[Laurynas Ivinskis]].&lt;ref name=le/&gt; Ivinskis soon withdrew from the committee. The first such  book was a primer intended for use in the new Russian schools that were replacing the Lithuanian parish schools. It appeared during the summer of 1864. The committee also published a [[Breviary|prayer book]], a calendar, and other religious literature.

About 55 Lithuanian-Cyrillic titles were published during the 40 years of the ban; about half of these were published during its first decade.&lt;ref name=le/&gt; Seeing that the Lithuanian people were unwilling to accept these books, even when they were offered for free, the Russian government shifted its attention to eliminating the illegal publications.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

The Russian Ministry of Education issued a report in May 1898 recommending that the press ban be repealed. The report stated that the ban had produced adverse and unforeseen results, including the development of Lithuanian nationalism. Other Russian officials had opined that the interests of the Russian state would be better served by the presence of a legal Lithuanian press that could be censored.&lt;ref name=LTR_en/&gt;

During the years of the ban, 3,047 people (829 [[knygnešiai|smugglers]], 859 distributors, and 1,359 persons possessing banned books) were arrested in connection with the ban.&lt;ref name=geras&gt;{{cite book | last=Jakštas | first=Juozas | editor=Ed.

Anti-Russian sentiment and distrust of the tsarist authorities had arisen after the 1863 revolt. The ban was also perceived as a threat to the Catholic Church; the Eastern Orthodox Church used the Cyrillic alphabet, and loyalty to the Latin alphabet was also a symbolic loyalty to Catholicism.&lt;ref name=le/&gt; Attempts were made to circumvent the ban by using [[Blackletter|Gothic script]]. However, that was also banned in 1872. A number of problems arose with the various Lithuanian-Cyrillic orthographies, which were all criticized as ill-adapted to the Lithuanian language. Within Russia, the ban was opposed by scholarly, liberal, and pro-democratic groups, which served to mitigate the punishments.&lt;ref name=lituanus3/&gt;
[[File:List of confiscated Lithuanian books.jpg|thumb|right|List of confiscated Lithuanian books in 1896]]
The organized resistance to the ban, both legal and illegal, was largely initiated by bishop [[Motiejus Valančius]], who petitioned the government to exempt prayer books from the ban. He then moved towards sponsoring the [[Knygnešiai|illegal flow of books from outside Lithuania]]. The period from Valančius death in 1875 to 1883 saw the establishment of the Lithuanian-language newspaper ''[[Auszra]]'' (The Dawn), and the resistance at this time is associated with bishop [[Antanas Baranauskas]]. The resistance intensified towards the end of the 19th century, after another major newspaper, ''[[Varpas]]'' (The Bell), edited by [[Vincas Kudirka]], was established in 1889. Between 1891 and 1893, 31,718 publications were confiscated and destroyed; between 1900 and 1902 this number increased to 56,182, reflecting their increased flow.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spaudos.lt/Knygnesiai/Knygnesys.en.htm Knygnešys/Booksmuggler]. The Lithuanian Word, Reprinted from the [[Encyclopedia Lituanica]], Boston, 1970-1978. Retrieved on 2009-03-17&lt;/ref&gt;

The period from 1890 to 1904 saw the publication of about 2,500 book titles in the Lithuanian Latin alphabet.  The majority of these were published in [[Tilsit]], a city in [[East Prussia]], although some publications reached Lithuania from the [[United States]]. A largely standardized written version of the language was achieved by the turn of the twentieth century, based on historical and [[Aukštaitija]]n (highland) usages;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lki.lt/index.php?test=206] Lithuanian Language Institute Abstracts.&lt;/ref&gt; the letters -č- and -š- were taken from [[Czech language|Czech]] orthography.&lt;ref name=gied&gt;[http://www.uic.edu/classes/lith/lith410/SUB_2004_double_orthography_SCHMA.pdf Double Orthography in American Lithuanian Newspapers at the Turn of the Twentieth Century].

A number of challenges to the ban's legal basis were made, and the use of this venue intensified at the end of the 19th century, along with an increasing number of letters, petitions, and protests from Lithuanians. In 1902 and 1903 the Russian Supreme Court reversed two press ban convictions that had been brought against Antanas Macijauskas and [[Povilas Višinskis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Awakening Lithuania |first=Jack J. |last=Stukas | publisher=The Florham Park Press | year=1966 |id={{LCC|66-28716}} |page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court's decisions stated that the original executive decree creating the ban was illegal. The outbreak of the [[Russo-Japanese War]] in February 1904 contributed to the Russian government's perception that its minorities needed to be accommodated.&lt;ref name=LTR_en/&gt; The ban was officially lifted on 26 April 1904.&lt;ref name=ltword/&gt;

==Effect on education==

Public and private education in Lithuanian was adversely affected by the press ban. The level of pent-up demand for schooling in the 19th century is illustrated by the increase in literacy in the [[Rietavas]] area; between 1853 and 1863, just before the ban, the number of literate persons rose from 11,296 to 24,330.&lt;ref name="lituanus3"/&gt; The subsequent ban is thought to have contributed to [[illiteracy]] in 19th-century Lithuania.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lituanus.org/2004/04_4_2Markelis.htm Talking Through Letters - Collaborative Writing in Early Lithuanian Immigrant Life]. [[Lituanus]], Winter 2004. Retrieved on 2009-03-17&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of the ruling, parish schools were closed. A shortage of teachers led to the closure of a number of state schools as well, in spite of population growth. Parents began to withdraw their children from the state schools, since they were associated with the policy of Russification; students were not allowed to speak Lithuanian among themselves, and a discouraging atmosphere was created by the system of searches, inspections, and spying. Many students were schooled at home or in small secret groups instead, although this practice also resulted in sanctions.&lt;ref name=lituanus3/&gt;

A census of the [[Kovno Governorate]] in 1897 showed that a higher proportion of older people than younger had received formal education: of persons age 30 to 39, 61.87% had experienced some level of formal education, compared to only 54.68% of persons aged 10 to 19.&lt;ref name="lituanus3"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
[[File:Proclamation of 1904.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Lithuanian proclamation after press ban lift, title reads ''Press is allowed!'' (1904)]]
After the ban was lifted, printing presses and their supporting social and cultural infrastructure needed to be established. The first issue of a Lithuanian newspaper after the ban, ''[[Vilniaus žinios]]'', appeared on December 23, 1904; the [[Great Seimas of Vilnius]], which took place in November 1905, was now able to issue its announcements and publications in Lithuanian.

The publishing houses of Martynas Kukta, [[Saliamonas Banaitis]], and the Society of [[St. Casimir]] in [[Kaunas]] were responsible for many of the publications issued between the end of the ban in 1904 and the restoration of Lithuanian independence in 1918. The businessman [[Petras Vileišis]] installed a printing press at his [[Vileišis Palace|palace]], commissioned in 1904. During this period 4,734 Lithuanian-language titles in the Latin alphabet were published in Lithuania and abroad. After Lithuanian independence was established, the rate of publication increased steadily; 16,721 book titles were printed from 1918 to 1939. Between 1925 and 1939 about 800 to 900 book titles were printed annually.&lt;ref name=ltword/&gt;

A standard Lithuanian orthography and grammar were established during the ban, despite the fact that the co-ordination of this process, involving competing dialects, was forced to take place in several countries. The ban is widely felt to have stimulated the Lithuanian national movement, rather than discouraging it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Lithuania/History#toc37338 |title=Lithuania - History - Russian Rule |work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |accessdate=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the 100th anniversary of the ban's end was noted in [[UNESCO]]'s events calendar, and the Lithuanian [[Seimas]] declared the "Year of the Lithuanian Language and Book." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spaudos.lt/Knygnesiai/Lithuanian_Preserve.en.htm Preserving the Language].

{{Ahmadiyya}}
'''Arabic - the Mother of all Languages - (Book) ''' ''Minan-ur-Rahman'' [Arabic: منن الرّحمٰن ] is a brief treatise on Philology by   [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]], (1835-1908) written in May 1895. Ahmad claimed that Arabic was the first language taught to man by God Himself and the Mother of all languages (Arabic: ''Ummul-al-Sinnah''). He highlighted certain peculiarities of the Arabic language, which he claimed could not be found in any other language and challenged his adversaries, to refute his claim also addressing [[Max Muller]] (1823-1900) to come forward and meet the challenge.

==A 20th Century Prophet Ahmad==
::"From my early age, I have been engaged in investigations in religion, I have never reconciled myself with mere platitudes or cursory observations ;  I have never been content with superficial ideas as is the wont of every dull person who is a prisoner of ignorance and untruth. I have never insisted upon baseless ideas, as is the habit of a narrow-minded person who had no desire to understand. Never has anything moved me towards anything except with the eye of penetrating research and except for the attraction of deep-delving insight, nothing has ever lured me into professing a formal creed. And no one has taught me except God Who is the best of all teachers." (page 35)

==Introduction to the book==
:: "So, I named the book منن الرّحمٰن .  [Literally]  ''Favours of the Beneficent God'',   for by many a variety of Grace and Favour, God Almighty bestowed a reward on me, and He is the best of the Givers of favours". (page. 77)  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alislam.org/library/browse/volume/Ruhani_Khazain/book/Minan_ur_Rehman/?l=Urdu#page/126/mode/1up Minan-ur-Rahman, (Arabic), by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1895)]&lt;/ref&gt;

A short Treatise, namely ''Minan-ur-Rahman'' (1895) English translation by Qazi Abdul Hameed, Lahore (1963)  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alislam.org/library/browse/volume/Ruhani_Khazain/book/Minan_ur_Rehman/?l=English#page/-3/mode/1up Minan-ur-Rahman (English Translation) 1963 by Qazi Abdul Hameed]&lt;/ref&gt;

Apparently the book appears to be in response to [[Max Muller]]'s belief that:
::: “I, therefore, date the real beginning of the science of language from the first day of [[Pentecost]].” &lt;ref&gt;Lectures on the Science of Language,  page 53. [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/32856/32856-0.txt] page 53&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahmad strongly reacted to this claim and  refuted [[Max Muller]]'s proposition by referring him to the NT Acts II:4-6, explaining that the Disciples only spoke languages already known and understood by all the Jews &lt;ref&gt;"And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance ... Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that every man heard them speak in his own language." -Acts 2:4,6"&lt;/ref&gt;
Ahmad writes, he very earnestly prayed to God, and asked for true knowledge in this regard. So God diverted his attention to a verse of the Quran 30:23.
:: وَمِنْ ءَايَـتِهِ خَلْقُ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ وَاخْتِلَـفُ أَلْسِنَتِكُمْ وَأَلْوَنِكُمْ
::إِنَّ فِى ذلِكَ لأَيَـتٍ لِّلْعَـلَمِينَ
[The Quran, 30:23] And among His Signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the diversity of your tongues and colours. In that surely are Signs for those who possess knowledge.

Ahmad claimed in light of Quranic verses:
::"All praise is due to Allah, the Sustainer, the Beneficent. To Him belongs all Excellence, Grace and Goodness. He created man and taught him a plain language. And out of one language He created various languages in different countries just as He created various colors (of mankind); out of one color. And He made Arabic the mother of all languages. He made it the like of the sun in brightness and luster."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alislam.org/topics/arabic/ Minan-ur-Rahman - Arabic - the mother of all languages]&lt;/ref&gt;

He claimed, the true Science of Languages has been taught in the Holy Quran, explaining the unique characteristics of the Arabic language. "He created man then taught him speech and guided him " (page 85).

==Unique Characteristics of Arabic==
In this book ''Minan-ur-Rahman'' Ahmad claimed that Arabic was the very First Language, taught to man by God. Ahmad describes the system of ''Mufradaat'' [the Simples or the Roots of words] in the Arabic Language had a unique scientific organization and a system, unknown in any other language. He described the five peculiarities of Arabic and claimed, all other languages of man, were derived from Arabic,

He explained, in the Arabic language, even the lonely alphabets (a, b, c etc.) at times manifest full and extensive meanings. e.g.:( see pp.&amp;nbsp;10–11)

فِ  (fi) 'Be faithful'

قِ  (qi) 'Keep an eye on'

لِ  (li) 'Come nearer'

عِ  ('I) 'Call to mind'

اِ   (I)  'Promise'

خِ  (Khe)  'Go, neither slowly nor fast, but with rather moderate pace'

ہِ   (hi)  'Burst thyself, or become weak'

دِ   (di)  'Pay blood-money'

رِ   (ri)  'Flare up, become brighter, or come out of the fireplace.' or 'Become dirty'

شِ  (shi)  'Paint thy garments with patterns '

نِ   (ni)   'Be slow or lazy'

Ahmad goes on explaining, sometimes even small '''single words''' give extensive meanings: e.g.

عرضتُ  (''araztu'') means: "I have roamed about Makkah, Madina, and all the habitations around them."

طہفلتُ  (''Tahfaltu'') means: "I eat and have determined always to eat Millet bread ."

جثمَ  (''Jasama'')  means: "Half the night has passed".

حیعلَ  (''Haya-al'')  means: "Come; Pray!  It is proper time."

==The Mother Language==
"The Arabic language possesses excellent qualities and signs which, in the eyes of scholars, invest it with the status of a Mother in relation to
other languages, and these languages are like a shadow in relation to Arabic or like sparrows in relation to a preying falcon." (page  100).

Ahmad believed that Arabic, being the First Language, however, in due course of time, great changes in the structure and form of the vocal apparatus, man's ecology and environment, and many other unknown factors, caused a diversification of Arabic language into thousands of tongues, all derived from Arabic. He writes, quoting from the Hebrew Torah,  Genesis 11:1:-
::: ויהי כל הארץ שׂפה אחת ודברים אחדים׃
:::"And the whole earth was one lip and speeches identical". (Gen, 11:1) [page. 14]
::...the nearness or remoteness of a place from the equator, of the distinctive effect of the various plants, and because of other unknown factors, every locality inheres in its inhabitants a proclivity of a special kind, towards developing a peculiar voice-apparatus, a distinctive accent, and a form of words which is of a peculiar character....[page: 12]

He after commenting upon the relationship of Hebrew, or Sanskrit to Arabic, writes:
::...all the languages of the world have come into existence through a process of far  reaching change, yet by fully pondering over it, and by looking at the operative factors, it clearly appears that the speeches and words of these languages have been transplanted into a variety of shapes and forms from Arabic simples. [page. 16]

::"Arabic is singular in its attributes, perfect in its root-words, wonderful  in the charm of its compounds and captivating in the structural beauty of its sentences." (page 105).

==Five Points of Excellence==
Ahmad highlighted ''Five'' points of the excellence of the Arabic language: [page. 17]

1. Arabic has a complete organised structure of roots, that is to say, the roots meet fully all the needs of human beings in the field of expression ; the other languages are not so fitted.

2. In Arabic, the names of the Divine Being, the names of the principal constituent parts of the universe, of plants, animals and minerals and of the members of the human body, possess, in the why and wherefore of their contents, deep philosophy and learning.

3. The Additions and the roots of Arabic words are perfectly organised. The scope of this organisation, by linking into one philosophical chain, all the verbs and nouns, belonging to the same root, points out their interrelationships. This is not to be found, to this degree of excellence, in other languages.

4. In Arabic expressions, words are few but meanings are many, that is to say, the Arabic language makes use of (ا) [alif], and (ل) [laam] and nunnation (تنوین) and the sequence of words, in such a way that to express the same meaning the other languages need a number of sentences to be linked up for the same purpose.

5. Arabic possesses roots and expressions which are the perfect means of portraying the most delicate and deep things of the mind and human ideas.

A greater part of the book is devoted to manifest these characteristic in further details. He writes, " Thousands of languages
are stricken with the calamity of a drawback that instead of root-words they make use of complex grammatical constructions, which shows that at a time of need such constructions have been invented by man." [page. 22]

==Arabic follows the Law of Nature==
After the above  ''Introductory details'', the rest of the treatise is in a very lucid and elegant Arabic.[page 27-127]
He explains that Arabic is unique to follow the patterns we observe in Nature. Two distinct features, i.e.'the pre-existing' Grace of God, like the bounties of Nature, the qualities inherent in the soil and earth, the sun and the changing weathers etc. And the second aspect being human efforts, labour and endeavours, these combine to give birth to the fruit of human endeavours. To fulfil these ''Two'' requirements,  Arabic has ''Two'' distinct words for ''Mercy'', ''Rahman'' [رحمان]and ''Raheem''. [رحیم].
To explain his point, Ahmad writes:
::It will be noticed that in as much  this quality Mercy, in accordance with the eternal distribution process. consisted of two manifestations of the Divine Law of Nature. there are to be found two root-words in the Arabic language to express that fact. And for a seeker of Truth. it would be profitable to follow the rule that the Attributes and Acts of God which are prominently portrayed in the Book of Nature should be taken as a standard, that their different categories which are apparent from the Law of Nature should be searched for in the root-words of Arabic, and that when ever it is intended to point out the difference between Arabic synonyms, which relate to the attributes or the acts of God, one should turn to the division and distribution of the attributes or acts of God which are apparent from the working of the universe, for, the real object of the Arabic language is the service of Divine Knowledge, as the real aim of the creation of man is the recognition of the Creator. [page. 35]

==Ten Categories of Arabic Roots==
Ahmad believed that Arabic was the Language of Divine Realization and designed to fulfill the Physical and Spiritual needs of man. He classified the Arabic Root-Words, into ten categories, calling them as the ''Ten Circles of Roots''. He describes them as follows: (pp: 38-40)

::1) Root-words  relating to the Person of God, arguments for the existence of God, His attributes, His Names and Acts, His Practice and Custom.

::2)  The system of root-words relating to the Unity of God and the arguments on behalf thereof.

::3) The system of root-words which deals with the attributes, acts, and actions, habits and situations, spiritual and physical, (of man) which, along with their mutual distinctions, are perpetrated by man and which may appear,  in agreement with or in opposition to God's Will.

::4) The system of root-words which constitute, as facts of Divine knowledge; a perfected  teaching from God Almighty and which relate to inculcations or techniques dealing with morals, beliefs, rights of God, rights of men, philosophic learning, punishments, commandments, the Do's and Dont's.

::5) The system of root-words which expound the nature of true salvation, the true means or methods of obtaining it; the signs by which the saved believers and those who occupy a station  of nearness to God may be recognized.

::6) The system of root-words which explain what is Islam, what is disbelief, what is ''shirk'' or polytheistic belief and which deal forth with the arguments for the truth of Islam, and refute the objections against Islam.

::7) The system of root-words which refute all the wrong beliefs of opponents.

::8) The system of root-words which relate to warnings and tidings, promise of favourable or adverse happenings ; which relate to description of the hereafter, to miracles and to parables or which are of the nature of prophecies which contribute to the strengthening of one's faith, or which relate to other expedient subjects, or which deal with narratives which are meant as a warning, a threat, or a tiding.

::9) The system of root-words which relate to the life-story and chaste qualities of the Holy Prophet (May peace and blessings of God be upon him,) which consist of the high example of the pure life of the Holy Prophet ; which also partake of full and forceful arguments in support of the prophet-hood of the Holy Prophet (may peace and the blessings of God be upon him.)

::10) The system of root-words which expound the beauties and the spiritual effectiveness of the Holy Quran and which set out its inherent qualities.

==Language as the Evolution of ''Names''==
How did language come into being? To quote Encyclopædia Britannica: " On the ultimate origin of language speculation has been rife, more, however, among philosophers than among philologists, who have very often been too matter-of-fact to take an interest in this problem. Some scholars (among them quite recently W. Schmidt) see the insufficiency of the usual theories, and giving up all attempts at explaining it in a natural way fall back on the religious belief that the first language was directly given to the first men by God through a miracle."  &lt;ref&gt;[http://gluedideas.com/content-collection/Encyclopedia-Britannica-Volume-13-Part-2-Kurantwad-Statue-of-Liberty/The-Origin-of-Language.html Origin of Language Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Archaeology and Bible history, (1992) by Joseph P. Free, page 43 (W. Schmidt on Language, [https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=haVoe4n0ifIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

::"When man was made to evolve through stages of creation ; when he was transferred from a state of potentiality to one of actuality, when he was given, in his nature and physical evolution, different shapes and figures, and some of the varieties of creation succeeded other varieties, and there happened to be mutual differences and distinctions, the process gave rise to many degrees and stages which required to be described by ''Names'',  Arabic provided them with their "names", and thus completed its gift as is the custom of rich philanthropists." (page 123)

==Further Contributions ==
A renowned Philologist Sheikh [[Muhammad Ahmad Mazhar]] (1896-1993) has contributed immensely to the work of [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]] and studied the various languages (around 35) and traced them to their Arabic Root-Words. The works, which trace the Arabic Roots, are the dictionary format, are easily available, can be downloaded freely by pasting the links in the browser's address bar.

'''Mitigated speech''' is a [[linguistic]] term describing deferential or indirect speech inherent in communication between individuals of perceived [[Geert Hofstede|High Power Distance]] which has been in use for at least two decades with many published references.&lt;ref&gt;Ng, Sik H. and Bradac, James J. : ''Power in Language: Verbal Communication and Social Influence (Language and Language Behavior)''  Sage Publications, Inc (May 25, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, William Peter and Tajfel, Henri: [https://books.google.com/books?id=toHSl37qbfMC&amp;pg=PA193&amp;lpg=PA193&amp;dq=Ng++Bradac+Power+in+Language&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=o27ICSXtLK&amp;sig=tHbmqXj0s68-p-ye1JD9ereSDjs&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=gZTQSdGMCs6dkAXf9-jZCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result#PPA193,M1 Social Groups and Identities] Routledge (1996) Retrieved 2009-03-30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kasper, Gabriele and Blum-Kulka, Shoshana: [https://books.google.com/books?id=QAsbd2oi7LMC&amp;pg=PA170&amp;lpg=PA170&amp;dq=%22mitigated+speech%22+linguistics&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UbqYXTVmQU&amp;sig=VrYIEFLQ8TkAo9UnsZS70QHJKRA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=7pPQScSEJ4iMkAWllOTjCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ct=result" Interlanguage Pragmatics] Oxford (1993).

The term was popularized by  [[Malcolm Gladwell]] in his book, ''[[Outliers (book)|Outliers]]'', where he defines mitigated speech as "any attempt to downplay or sugarcoat the meaning of what is being said".&lt;ref&gt;Gladwell, Malcolm: ''Outliers: The Story of Success'', Penguin (2008) p.194&lt;/ref&gt; He continues with reference to Fischer and Orasanu,&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, Ute and Orasanu, Judith: ''Cultural Diversity and Crew Communication'', paper presented at Astronautical Congress, Amsterdam; American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; to describe 6 degrees of mitigation with which we make suggestions to authority: 

# '''Command''' – "Strategy X is going to be implemented" 
# '''Team Obligation Statement'''  – "We need to try strategy X" 
# '''Team Suggestion''' – "Why don't we try strategy X?" 
# '''Query''' – "Do you think strategy X would help us in this situation?" 
# '''Preference''' – "Perhaps we should take a look at one of these Y alternatives" 
# '''Hint''' – "I wonder if we could run into any roadblocks on our current course" 

Gladwell brings up the concept in the context of how crews relate to each other in the cockpit of a commercial airliner, graphically illustrating the degree to which mitigated speech can be detrimental in high-risk situations which require clear communication.

'''Mock language''' is a term in [[linguistic anthropology]] for the intentional use of a language not spoken by or native to the speaker that is used to reinforce the speaker's [[language ideology]] of the hegemonic language.

When talking, the speaker includes words or phrases from other languages that they think fit into the conversation. The term "[[Mock Spanish]]" was popularized in the 1990s by [[Jane H. Hill]], a linguist at the [[University of Arizona]], mock Spanish is the most common form of mock language in the southwestern [[United States]], where Hill first researched the phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://language-culture.binghamton.edu/symposia/2/part1/|title=Mock Spanish: A Site For The Indexical Reproduction Of Racism In American English|last=Hill|first=Jane H.|date=|website=language-culture.binghamton.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "Mock" has since been applied to other languages, and the [[umbrella term]] "Mock language" developed. Mock language is commonly viewed as a form of appropriation. In the United States, the most common form is mock Spanish. However, globally, mock language is used to share meaning between the speaker and audience about the speech community the speaker is mocking.

== Definition ==
The speaker is unintentionally indexing a [[language ideology]] that all Americans should speak English or that other languages are secondary in the US. Using words outside the speaker's native language neglects context of the conversion, meaning of the word or phrase, or conceptual knowledge including historical injustices to the borrowed language, culture, and physical surroundings. It is a borrowing words in different languages and using it in your context.

When using mock language, the speaker is showing their '[[cosmopolitanism]]' or global knowledge. One dominant language ideology is that English should be the only language spoken in the United States, establishing English as a hegemonic language. This [[hegemony]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=3uxHCFOrEjwC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=Lull,+J.+(2000).+Media,+communication,+culture:+A+global+approach+(2nd+ed.).+New+York:+Columbia+University+Press&amp;ots=JARfcJrcB6&amp;sig=ejH_hZjCuDYZ_TAtfVqbdYYQpwc#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Media, Communication, Culture: A Global Approach|last=Lull|first=James|date=2000|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=9780231120739|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; creates a dominance of the hegemonic group over the ones that have not conformed. Mock language reinforces this, as it takes language and culture out of context to show the speaker's worldly knowledge, but does not celebrate or intellectually use the language. This ideology is actually maintaining the subordinate status of the other languages used as the language speakers in that community are expected to speak English and not in a mocking way.

For the opposing perspective, saying that using other languages in an English conversation is supportive of that language, it does not show awareness of the cultural or social meanings behind the words spoken.  
 
== History, Theorists, and Contributors ==
The term "Mock Spanish" was popularized in the 1990s by linguistic anthropologist Jane H. Hill. This led to other languages being referred to as "Mock-Languages." Increasing globalization in modern history has contributed significantly to the spreading and study of Mock-Language in linguistic anthropology. Globalization has occurred at an exponential rate through numerous media—such as television and social networking applications—during the turn of the 21st century. With globalization, more languages are being encountered in daily interactions, and more people are able to travel. To show this global perspective, it is common to incorporate words of different languages into your native language, thus mock language.

Hill analyzes the 'inner sphere' and 'outer spheres' in which Puerto Ricans living in [[New York City|New York]] uses their [[Multilingualism|bilingualism]]. In the inner sphere of neighborhood and intimates such as family and close friends, the boundaries between English and Spanish are blurred formally and functionally. However, in the outer sphere with strangers or government officials, the usage of Spanish becomes [[Markedness|marked]] and "sharply objectified" to the point where the boundaries are so distinct that bilingual speakers may become too scared to speak at all.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hill|first=Jane|date=|title=Language, Race, and White Public Space|url=https://www-jstor-org.colorado.idm.oclc.org/stable/682046?pq-origsite=summon|journal=American Anthropologist|volume=100 (No. 3)|pages=680–689|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This shows the hegemonic power of English and how Spanish speakers feel vulnerable and powerless to use Spanish. The need for perfect English is absolute, yet when English speakers dabble in Spanish in this mocking way, there is no nervousness, as their agency extends beyond English hegemony and into the power an English speaker holds in American society. Hill also discusses how [[semantic domain]]s index a state.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Saying something is "el cheapo" indexes that Spanish speakers do not have money or commonly buy cheap, crappy goods.

In a more recent study of Mock White Girl, researcher Tyanna Slobe explains how it is a hegemonic representation of a language being dominated than another and how people would to try to identify with that race by saying a combination of words in that language. “...complicating the moralizing gaze with which linguists have approached mock as uniformly reproducing white supremacist ideologies.”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Slobe|first=Tyanna|date=2018|title=Style, Stance, and Social Meaning in Mock White Girl|url=|journal=Language in Society|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the performance piece that people want others to portray themselves to why they would speak this way.

Mock white girl shows how the intentional use of [[Vocal fry register|vocal fry]] to convey a mockery of the white, upper-class, suburban, spoiled young adult or teenager is conveying a shared meaning that the language the speaker is mocking is subordinate and not to be taken seriously. It indexes the characteristics of a stereotypical white girl and uses the n+1 level of indexicality for the public to make the connection between the mockery and the speech community.

Another semantic domain is language crossing. “Language crossing involves code alternation by people who are not accepted members of the group associated with the second language that they are using (code switching into varieties that are not generally thought to belong to them). This kind of switching involves a distinct sense of movement across social or ethnic boundaries and it raises issues of legitimacy which, in one way or another, participants need to negotiate in the course of their encounter.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rampton|first=Ben|date=1995-12-01|title=Language crossing and the problematisation of ethnicity and socialisation|url=http://www.jbe-platform.com/content/journals/10.1075/prag.5.4.04ram|journal=Pragmatics. Quarterly Publication of the International Pragmatics Association (IPrA)|language=en|volume=5|issue=4|pages=485–513|doi=10.1075/prag.5.4.04ram|issn=1018-2101|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is similar to mock language as the people code alternating are not members of the group, similar to how mock-language speakers are English speakers not members of the language they are mocking.

== Implications of Study ==
Mock language is used in [[anthropology]] and [[linguistics]] to interpret different languages in a conversation and the characteristics of borrowing words from a language. It is important to study mock language in order to preserve the original foundations of languages or dialects that have become subject to the pressure of globalization. Each time a mock phrase is used, it reinforces the divergence from the original language. Globalization occurs at a much faster rate today than in the past, largely due to technological advancements that connect the world with no regard for national borders. American culture is overwhelmingly dominant in the field of online media, and American interpretations of other cultures often become somewhat of a universal standard, at least in terms of exposure. This makes it important for linguists to analyze such interpretations and recognize their origins.

The study of Mock Language also reveals several powerful racial ideologies in the way English speakers hold agency to use other languages carelessly. “It is certainly useful to think of linguistic signs as being bound to historical contexts. But a limited historical view of language fails to address the fact that speakers are often not aware of the historical references they make by using particular signs.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chun|first=Elaine W.|date=June 2001|title=The Construction of White, Black, and Korean American Identities through African American Vernacular English|url=https://anthrosource.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1525/jlin.2001.11.1.52|journal=Journal of Linguistic Anthropology|language=en|volume=11|issue=1|pages=52–64|doi=10.1525/jlin.2001.11.1.52|issn=1055-1360|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This leads to a general ignorance, mostly from the perspective of English speakers, regarding the use of certain phrases. Misuses of certain words can eventually be attributed to legitimate cultures after overuse, especially with the help of modern media as a medium of exposure, undermining history and often introducing the possibility of offending native speakers.

== Controversy ==
In the United States, the dominant language ideology is that English should be the official language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/lifestyle/general_lifestyle/april_2018/americans_strongly_favor_english_as_official_language|title=Americans Strongly Favor English as Official Language|last=|first=|date=2018-04-26|website=Rasmussen Reports|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Racial minorities are treated adversely than whites, and their languages are not perceived as “American”.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} There are many social, economic, environmental disadvantages of minority groups. The dominant ideology does not allow these groups to celebrate their language, yet “mock language involves borrowings and wordplay by speakers who require little comprehension of the other language.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vessey|first=Rachelle|date=2014|title=Borrowed words, mock language and nationalism in Canada|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14708477.2013.863905|journal=Language and Intercultural Communication|volume=14|issue=2|pages=176–190|doi=10.1080/14708477.2013.863905|issn=1470-8477|eissn=1747-759X|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mock language reinforces the status and social differences of native English speakers versus minorities and ethnic communities.

== Features of Mock Language ==
[[File:Namaste in bed.jpg|thumb|People usually wear this shirt to indicate that they are going to yoga or going to sleep to promote laziness and zen with the language Hindi.It creates a pun through code switching, but the Hindi word is not actually associated with yoga.]]
While not every use of mock language is the same, aspects such as gendered indicators, greetings, and pronouns are commonly used. It may come about without the intention of knowing the harm for that language's speech community. Mock Spanish commonly uses gendered [[pronoun]]s of 'el', 'la', and adds '-o' to the end of words.

Mock-white girl is a type of mock language that is inspired by the stereotypical "white girl's" vernacular. It commonly uses features such as 'like' in excess to imply the speaker is not well spoken or articulate. It also features [[uptalk]], [[creaky voice]], blondness and the stereotypical association with [[Starbucks]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Mock-Hindi has taken the word 'namaste' out of context singularly and does not borrow other words or linguistic features from the language. While these are all very different mock languages features, they all do not respect the original languages and highlight the language ideology of English dominance in the US. Additionally, it does not [[Code Switch|code switch]] between the two languages, a linguistic term for switching between two languages the speaker knows, as the speaker clearly does not know [[Hindi]] when using it in such a context. 
  
== Mock Spanish ==
It has been adapted in society for people to code switch between languages but there is a boundary where "speaking" the language is inauthentic and distasteful. People tend to say "el" or add an "o" at the end of words as if they are speaking mock Spanish such as el cheapo, no problemo. The semantic domain is cheapness and it suggests that Spanish speakers have a limited amount of money and like to get things that are lower quality and low-priced.

“Mock Spanish relies upon the semiotic construction of two basic social types: the easygoing, humorous, and somewhat cosmopolitan white person and the lazy, dirty, sexually “loose,” and unintelligent Spanish speaker.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roth-Gordon|first=Jennifer|date=2011-11-24|title=Discipline and Disorder in the Whiteness of Mock Spanish1|url=https://anthrosource.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1548-1395.2011.01107.x|journal=Journal of Linguistic Anthropology|language=en|volume=21|issue=2|pages=211–229|doi=10.1111/j.1548-1395.2011.01107.x|issn=1055-1360}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- More needed. Can you outline all the rules that Hill noticed? --&gt; &lt;!-- Did you guys read Hill's "Mock Spanish: A site for the indexical reproduction of racism in American English"? Here she gives all of the features and she explains the use of Mock Spanish in terms of creating "semantic domains." As long as you cite it properly, you can include all of her findings. --&gt;

== Examples ==
[[File:Danke Sign.jpg|thumb|Danke Sign: This sign shows the business's affiliation to Germany. While trying to teach the English speaking viewers a German word, it does not provide any pronunciation guides or context.|227x227px]]Popular T-shirts for young women with the saying "[[namaste]] in bed". This borrows the traditional greeting from [[Hindi]] and makes it into a pun of the slang term "imma stay in bed". It also associates the Hindi word as a [[yoga]] term, though this is misappropriation as it is a term used for greeting, not concluding a yoga session. It is in relation to being lazy.

[[Cinco de Mayo]], a holiday that celebrates Mexico’s defeat of the French on May 5, 1862, has become extremely popular in the United States as a celebration based largely on the consumption of alcohol. Due to this association, the term “[[Cinco de Drinko]]” has emerged, representing both ignorance toward the holiday’s history and an example of the “add ‘o’” phenomenon. The “add ‘o’” phenomenon is the practice of English speakers adding an “o” to the end of an English word in order to give it the false appeal of being a Spanish word.

YouTuber “[[Louise Pentland|Sprinkle of Glitter]]” would open videos until 2017 saying “Aloha Sprinklerinos”. While not only making up a word for the name of her follower base, she used mock Hawaiian; dropping in what she perceived as a fun, innocent greeting without knowing anything about Hawaiian language, culture, context in which Hawaiians say and use the word aloha, and historical inequalities facing Hawaiians.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ec_geALd1A&lt;/ref&gt;

"Mock White Girl" is a common example that is seen in movies where the girls are speaking in standard English with creaky voice and are trying to be portrayed as privileged, popular, and in power. In the 2004 film ''[[Mean Girls]],'' character Regina George is known to be the most popular girl in school and throughout the movie she has the voice for people to recognize her status.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAOmTMCtGkI&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mock german.jpg|thumb|'Das Boot' mocks the German language for English speaking marketing purposes as "boot" does not translate into a type of footwear but to 'boat' in English. This shows the semantic domain which associates anything German with a drinking culture.]]
Bars and pubs around the world have signs that try to imitate European bar and pub culture. Oftentimes, German is incorporated due to the association of German culture with drinking. This decontextualization and use of stereotype is mock language. Danke is German for "thank you", but it is decontextualized in an English-speaking environment.

The signs are using German as an international language of beer or drinking, but "das boot" in German translates as “the boat” and has nothing to do with shoes or drinking. Nevertheless, it is used as the name of a drink represented by footwear. Using 'danke' in a pub may show knowledge of a direct translation, however it stereotypes drinking beer with German culture and language.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8309">'''The National Center for Voice and Speech''' (NCVS), is a multi-site research and teaching organization dedicated to studying the characteristics, limitations and enhancement of human voice and speech. The NCVS is located in Salt Lake City, Utah with the Lead Institution located at the University of Utah. NCVS is also a Center at the [[University of Iowa]] where it has laboratories in the Department of Speech Pathology and Audiology.  In addition, the NCVS has collaborators in Denver and at many institutions around the United States.  Its focus is [[vocology]], or the science and practice of voice habilitation.&lt;ref&gt;van Mersbergen M et al. (2001). "Preparation of the speech-language pathologist specializing in voice: an educational survey.", J Voice. 15(2):237-50.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Titze, I.R. (1994). Principles of Voice Production, Prentice Hall.  {{ISBN|978-0-13-717893-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Initially conceived as a "center without walls," the NCVS was formally organized in 1990 with the assistance of a grant from the [[National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders]] (NIDCD), an institute of the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH). The NCVS was organized on the premise that a consortium of institutions (including the Wilber James Gould Voice Center at the [[Denver Center for the Performing Arts|DCPA]], [[University of Iowa]], [[University of Utah]], [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]]) would be better able to conduct and disseminate research than a single organization. NCVS members, although geographically separate, were linked by a common desire to fully understand the characteristics, limitations and enhancement of human voice and speech.

In 1999, NIDCD discontinued the Multi-Purpose Research and Training Center funding mechanism for the entire institute focusing instead on single-project research awards (R01s). In a July 2000 meeting, however, NCVS investigators voted unanimously to continue the concept of a national resource center for voice and speech, to be driven by a variety of single-project research awards (R01s), as well as health communication, core, and training grants. In 2001, the NCVS moved its central location to Denver, where the otolaryngologist Dr. Wilbur James Gould had founded a center to study the voice and speech patterns of stage performers.

The NCVS team of investigators, led by [[Ingo Titze]], studies the powers, limitations and enhancement of [[human voice]] and [[Speech communication|speech]].  The investigators are scientists, clinicians, educators, engineers and musicians who use diverse backgrounds (i.e., speech-language pathology, [[physics]], [[computer science]], [[acoustics]], [[human voice|vocal performance]], [[biology]], [[medicine]] and [[engineering]]) to work together on voice and speech investigations.  As a direct outgrowth of their work, NCVS members also teach other investigators and practitioners who work with voice, as well as speech clients and the general public.  One example is the Summer Vocology Institute, which trains voice coaches and vocal health professionals in the study of [[Vocology]].

At the provincial level, [[New Brunswick]] is the only official bilingual province, while [[Quebec]] is the only province where French is the sole official language. The remaining provinces have English as the only official language. In practice, all provinces, including Quebec, offer some bilingual services and some education in both official languages up to the high school level. English and French are official languages in all three territories (because they are federally administered). In addition, [[Inuktitut]] is also an official language in [[Nunavut]], and nine aboriginal languages have official status in the [[Northwest Territories]].

[[Spanish language|Spanish]] was the national and official language of the country for more than three centuries under Spanish colonial rule, and became the [[lingua franca]] of the Philippines in the 19th and early 20th centuries. It remained, along with English, as a de facto official language until removed in 1973 by a constitutional change. After a few months it was re-designated an official language by [[presidential decree]] and remained official until 1987, when the [[1987 Constitution|present Constitution]] removed its official status.&lt;ref name="official languages"&gt;Article XIV, Section 3 of the [http://thecorpusjuris.com/laws/constitutions/item/1935-constitution.html 1935 Philippine Constitution] provided, "[...] Until otherwise provided by law, English and Spanish shall continue as official languages."

Some people in native Tagalog areas are bilingual, while in non-Tagalog areas it is common to be multilingual in Filipino, English, and in one or more of the regional [[Languages of the Philippines|language]]s, or as in other cases in languages such as Spanish, [[Southern Min|Minnan]] ([[Hokkien]]), and Arabic due to factors such as ancestry and religion. Eleven regional languages are recognised by the government as auxiliary official languages in their respective regions, while 90+ other languages and dialects are spoken by various groups.

'''Optimot, linguistic inquiries''', is a service provided by the Directorate - General of Linguistic Policy of the Catalan Government in collaboration with the [[Institut d'Estudis Catalans|Institute for Catalan Studies]] and the Terminology Center TERMCAT. It consists of a search engine for linguistic information that helps to clarify doubts about the Catalan language. With Optimot different sources can be checked at the same time in an integrated way. When the search options provided by Optimot do not manage to answer the linguistic question, a personalized inquiry service can be accessed.

== History ==
Up to 2007, the Consortium for Linguistic Normalization, the TERMCAT Terminology Centre, the Institute of Catalan Studies, and the directorate-general of Linguistics Politics dealt with linguistic inqueries that came from general population, companies, organizations, and language professionals. In order to avoid decentralization of the linguistic enquiries and to offer a unified service, Optimot was implemented. The search engine started working in October 2007 and the personalized service began in February 2008. Mainly, Optimot was to improve quality in linguistic-inquiry service by unifying criteria, and to promote linguistic autonomy.

== Search sources ==
The sources used in the searches performed by Optimot are the following:&lt;ref&gt;«[http://www20.gencat.cat/portal/site/Llengcat/menuitem.91021952ed2301e7a129d410b0c0e1a0/?vgnextoid=ee8e44ce74aa3110VgnVCM1000008d0c1e0aRCRD Optimot, consultes lingüístiques]».&amp;#x20;&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Platonism}}
'''Plato's Problem''' is the term given by [[Noam Chomsky]] to "the problem of explaining how we can know so much" given our limited experience.&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, Noam: Knowledge of Language, 1986, p. xxv&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky believes that Plato asked (using modern terms) how we should account for the rich, intrinsic, common structure of human cognition, when it seems undetermined by extrinsic evidence presented to a person during human development.&lt;ref&gt;[https://chomsky.info/1991____/ Noam Chomsky interview: Journal of Advanced Composition, Vol. 11, No. 1, 1991]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[linguistics]] this is referred to as the "[[argument from poverty of the stimulus]]" (APS). Such arguments are common in the natural sciences, where a developing theory is always "[[Underdetermination|underdetermined]] by evidence".&lt;ref&gt;[https://chomsky.info/1998____/ Hornstein, Norbert -- Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy, London, 1998]&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky's approach to Plato's Problem involves treating cognition as a normal research topic in the natural sciences, so cognition can be studied to elucidate intertwined genetic, developmental, and biophysical factors.&lt;ref&gt;[https://chomsky.info/20040517/ Chomsky, Noam, 2004: Biolinguistics and the Human Capacity]&lt;/ref&gt; Plato's Problem is most clearly illustrated in the [[Meno]] dialogue, in which [[Socrates]] demonstrates that an uneducated boy nevertheless understands geometric principles.

==Introduction==
What is [[knowledge]]? What is [[experience]]? How do they interact? Is there a correlational, causal, or reciprocal relationship between knowledge and experience? These and other related questions have been at the forefront of investigation by problem solvers, scientists, psychologists, and philosophers for centuries. These questions, but particularly the problem of how experience and knowledge interrelate, have broad theoretical and practical implications for such academic disciplines as [[epistemology]], linguistics, and [[psychology]] (specifically the subdiscipline of [[thinking]] and [[problem solving]]). Gaining a more precise understanding of human knowledge, whether defined as innate, [[Experiential knowledge|experiential]], or both, is an important part of effective problem solving.

[[Plato]] was the first [[philosopher]] who systematically inquired into issues such as those noted above. He wrote many dialogues, such as [[Euthyphro]] and the [[Apology (Plato)|Apology]], but it is from the [[Meno]] that the modern instantiation of Plato's Problem is derived. In the Meno, Plato theorizes about the relationship between knowledge and experience and provides an explanation for how it is possible to know something that one has never been explicitly taught. Plato believed that we possess [[innate]] ideas that precede any knowledge that we gain through experience.

As formulated by Noam Chomsky,[http://www.usc.edu/dept/LAS/linguistics/langmind.htm#dresher] accounting for this gap between knowledge and experience is "Plato's Problem". The phrase has a specific linguistic context with regard to language acquisition but can also be used more generally.

==Plato (427 B.C. – 347 B.C.)==
[[File:Plato.png|thumb|right|Plato]]

===Early work===
Plato's early philosophical endeavors involved poetry discussing many ideas, such as the differences between knowledge and opinion, particulars and [[universals]], and God and man. These early dialogues do not utilize conventional notions of [[reason]]. Rather, they appeal to the emotions, the [[allegorical]], the [[spirituality|spiritual]], and the [[mythological]] interests of an ancient speculative mind.

Controversy surrounds the early [[dialogues]] in how they are to be interpreted. Some claim that Plato was truly trying to discover objective reality through these mystical speculations while others maintain that the dialogues are stories to be interpreted only as parables, allegories, and emotional appeals to religious experience. Regardless, Plato would come to formulate a more rigorous and comprehensive philosophy later in his life, one that reverberates in contemporary [[Western culture|Western]] thought to this day.

Some of Plato's famous works are [[Phaedo]], the [[Crito]], and, as noted earlier, the Meno. Within these works are found a comprehensive philosophy that addresses epistemology, [[metaphysics]], [[ethics]], [[aesthetics]], [[theology]], and [[logic]]. As noted, most of the writing is in the form of dialogues and [[argument]]s to pursue answers to difficult questions and concepts. Plato's teacher and mentor, Socrates, always plays a significant and formative role in these dialogues.

===Socrates (470 B.C. – 399 B.C.)===
[[File:Socrates Louvre.jpg|thumb|right|Socrates]]
Most of Plato's philosophical ideas were communicated through his beloved teacher [[Socrates]] as a presence in the dialogues. Though there are no extant writings of Socrates known, it is evident through Plato's works that Socrates had an incredible ability to explore the most intense analytical discussions. However, for some there is controversy regarding how much historical fact can be derived from Plato's Socrates (Russell). Some doubt Socrates ever existed. Others are skeptical as to the accuracy of some of Plato's dialogues but nonetheless maintain that we can learn a substantial amount of historical information about Socrates from the dialogues. Still others take practically everything Plato wrote about Socrates as veridical history. Regardless, it may be safe to say that Plato never meant to record Socrates verbatim and it may plausibly be concluded that his general ideas were communicated in the dialogues.

====Socratic method====
As delineated in various writings, the meticulousness, articulation, and sophistication with which Socrates spoke supplies an outstanding problem solving technique – the [[Socratic Method]]. The Socratic method may be described as follows: it usually involves others with whom Socrates directly engages (not merely pontificating to an audience), it involves a deep philosophical or ethical question to which an answer was sought, and it usually involves Socrates asking questions either to affirm his understanding of others or to seek their understanding.

If someone disagreed with him, Socrates would execute this process in order to bring about his interlocutor's reluctant admission of inconsistencies and contradictions. Either Socrates would ask his debators questions about their claims that would lead them to admit their fallacy or Socrates would answer questions by posing questions meant to lead the other to answer their own query.

[[File:Socrates teaching.jpg|thumb|right|The Socratic Method]]

===Meno===
One such dialogue of Plato's that utilized the Socratic Method was the Meno. The participants were Socrates, Meno, Anytus, and one of Meno's slave boys. The dialogue begins with Meno asking Socrates whether [[virtue]] can be taught. Socrates responds by stating that he does not know the definition of virtue. Meno replies by stating the characteristics of a virtuous man, to which Socrates responds that the characteristics of a virtuous man may be the by-products of virtuousness but they by no means define virtue. Meno is obliged to agree; to wit, he tries to modify his explanation of virtue. Socrates counters each attempt by pointing to inconsistencies and circular arguments.

Meno seems to commit two fallacies when trying to define virtue. He either defines it using some form of the word itself, or he defines it using other words that call for definitions and explanations themselves. Eventually, Meno is led to confess his shortcomings as he tries to define the enigmatic term (the [[Socratic method]] is the mechanism that brings about this confession). Socrates claims that a definition of virtue must consist of common terms and concepts that are clearly understood by those in the discussion.

A crucial point in the dialogue is when Socrates tells Meno that there is no such thing as teaching, only recollection of knowledge from past lives, or [[Anamnesis (philosophy)|anamnesis]]. Socrates claims that he can demonstrate this by showing that one of Meno's servants, a slave boy, knows [[geometric]] principles though he is uneducated. Socrates states that he will teach the boy nothing, only ask him questions to assist the process of recollection. Socrates proceeds to ask the slave boy a series of questions about the size and length of lines and squares, using visual diagrams to aid the boy in understanding the questions. The crucial point to this part of the dialogue is that, though the boy has no training, he knows the correct answers to the questions – he intrinsically knows the [[Pythagorean theorem|Pythagorean proposition]].

====Innate knowledge====

Shortly before the demonstration of [[Pythagoras' theorem]], the dialogue takes an epistemological turn when the interlocutors begin to discuss the fundamental nature of knowledge. The general question asked is how one can claim to know something when one does not even know what knowledge is. Via the Socratic method, it is shown that the answer to the question posed is [[innate]]ness – one possesses ''[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' knowledge.

This is derived from Socrates' belief that one's soul existed in past lives and knowledge is transferred from those lives to the current one. "These [ideas] were revealed in a former state of existence, and are recovered by reminiscence (anamnesis) or association from sensible things" [http://plato.thefreelibrary.com/Meno/1-1]. The claim is that one does not need to know what knowledge is before gaining knowledge, but rather one has a wealth of knowledge before ever gaining any experience.

==Contemporary parallels==
There are contemporary contexts that provide input for the various questions posed here: how to account for the gap between experience and knowledge, what are some of the sources of knowledge, or how much knowledge is possessed prior to experience or without conscious awareness. There are many areas in contemporary linguistics and psychological research that have relevance to these epistemological questions. Linguistic analysis has provided some strong evidence for innate cognitive capacities for language and there are many areas of cognitive psychology that yield hard data from investigations into sources of knowledge. In addition, there are some claims in the Meno that have connections to current research on perception and long-term memory (LTM).

===Linguistics===
[[File:Noam chomsky.jpg|thumb|right|Noam Chomsky]]
[[Linguistics]] is the scientific study of language. Chomskyan linguistics (''an inclusive, though perhaps informal, label for the theories and methodologies of linguistic study spearheaded by Noam Chomsky, meant to encompass his extensive work and influence in the field'') includes everything from Chomsky's earliest work in [[transformational grammar]] to more recent work in the [[Minimalist Program]]. More exactly, it is the study of the structure of language, or [[grammar]]. Chomskyan linguistics is defined by a particular theoretical foundation and methodological approach that sets it apart from other linguistic perspectives, such as those described by [[functional theories of grammar|functional grammar]] or structuralism (per [[Leonard Bloomfield]]) for example. This particular approach to the study of language is also often referred to as [[Generative linguistics]], which is attributed to Chomsky and his early [[generative grammar]] work.

====Universal grammar====
There are several concepts important to the Chomskyan (or generativist) approach to linguistics. The most fundamental of these ideas is the theory of [[universal grammar]] (UG). Simply put, and as implied by the name, UG refers to those grammatical properties thought to be shared by all (to be universal to all) derivations of human language (anything from [[Amharic]] to [[Standard Zhuang|Zhuang]]).

Per this conceptualization, UG is innate to all humans – people come "pre-wired" with this universal grammatical structure. A person's individual grammar (that which is unique to the person) develops from the interaction between the innate universal grammar and input from the environment, or primary linguistic data. This "analytic triplet" (McGilvray, ed., 2005, p. 51), UG + input = grammar, is the functional core of the theory.

;Language acquisition
Several questions (or problems) motivate linguistic theorizing and investigation. Two such taken up in Chomskyan linguistics are the process of [[language acquisition]] in children, and "Plato's Problem". These subjects are interrelated and viewed as evidence in support of the theory of UG.

One of the simplest ways to approach the concept of universal grammar is to pose a hypothetical question about an aspect of language acquisition in children – why does a child learn the language that it does. As a specific example, how can a child of Asian descent (say, born of Chinese parents) be set down in the middle of Topeka, Kansas and acquire "perfect English?" The answer is that the child does not start with "[[Chinese language|Chinese]]", or any other conventionally defined language, in its head. The child does start with general grammatical rules that determine linguistic properties.

Children come equipped with universal grammar, from which any natural human language will develop – without instruction. All that is needed is passive input during the critical period—defined in linguistics as that period within which a child must have necessary and sufficient exposure to human language so that language acquisition occurs; without sufficient exposure to primary linguistic data, the UG does not have the necessary input for development of an individual grammar; this period is commonly recognized as spanning from birth to adolescence, generally up to the age of 12 years, though individual variations are possible. If what the child predominantly hears (or sees via sign) as it is maturing through this critical period is the English spoken in Topeka, Kansas, then that is what the child will acquire. This is why, regardless of a child's ethnic/racial background (or any other non-relevant factor, the child will know Cockney English, [[Egyptian Arabic]], or [[isiZulu]] if the child's primary linguistic input is Cockney English, Egyptian Arabic, or isiZulu, respectively.

The hypothetical question posed addresses a common misconception about what is instantiated in the mind/brain of an individual when it comes to language. It does not address the "logical problem" of language acquisition, i.e., how children transition from ostensibly having no knowledge of language to having full knowledge, in what may be described as a very limited time with apparently limited input.

;Plato's problem

To address the issue of apparently limited input, one must turn to what is possibly the most quoted of all arguments in support of universal grammar and its [[Universal grammar|nativist]] interpretation – Plato's Problem. The phrase refers to the Socratic dialogue, the Meno; [[Noam Chomsky]] is often attributed with coining the term.

Noam Chomsky's 1986 "'Knowledge of Language' begins with informal characterization of 'Plato's Problem:  The problem of explaining how we can know so much given so little evidence.'"&lt;ref&gt;Edward Stabler, Philosophy of Science,  Review of Nom Chomsky, 'Knowledge of Language:  Its nature origin and use,' Vol.56 No.3 1989 Pp.533-536 University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

"The Book is organized around a discussion of Plato's problem [Chomsky] quoting Russell[:]"&lt;ref&gt;Norbert Hornstein, Philosophical Review, Reviewing Noam Chomsky 1986, 'Knowledge of Language,' Vol.97 No.4 1988 Pp.567-573 Duke Univ. Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Plato’s Problem was expressed generally by Bertrand Russell: "How comes it that human beings, whose contacts with the world are brief and personal and limited, are nevertheless able to know as much as they do know?" The problem arises in the domain of language acquisition in that children attain infinitely more than they experience. Literally so, we shall see: they attain a productive system, a grammar, on the basis of very little experience. So there is more, much more, to language acquisition than mimicking what we hear in childhood, and there is more to it than the simple transmission of a set of words and sentences from one generation of speakers to the next. There is more to it than a reproduction of experience and, in maturity, our capacity goes well beyond what we have experienced.
Consider some subtleties that people are not consciously aware of. The verb is may be used in its full form or its reduced form: people say Kim is happy or Kim’s happy. However, certain instances of is never reduce, for example, the underlined items in Kim is happier than Tim is or I wonder what the problem is in Washington. Most people are not aware of this, but we all know subconsciously not to use the reduced form here. How did we come to this? The question arises because the eventual knowledge is richer than relevant experience. As children, we heard instances of the full form and the reduced form, but we were not instructed to avoid the reduced form in certain places; we had no access to "negative data," information about what does not occur.&lt;ref&gt;David Lightfoot, 2007:  The Cambridge Companion to Chomsky, Chapter 2 - Plato’s Problem, UG, and the language organ pp. 42-59&lt;/ref&gt;

Plato's Problem particularly refers to a point in the dialogue when Socrates is talking with an uneducated servant and shows, through this interaction, that the servant knows the Pythagorean Theorem though he has never been explicitly taught any geometry. How does the servant know without having ever been taught? Plato's suggestion is, essentially, that people have innate knowledge.

In the field of linguistics, Plato's Problem is the problem of finding an explanation for how a child acquires language though the child does not receive explicit instruction and the primary linguistic data a child does receive is limited. This PLD is the input, or stimuli, from the environment, necessary for the development of an individual's grammar – language – via input into UG. This limited environmental stimulus is referred to as [[poverty of the stimulus]]. Specifically, the stimuli to which children are exposed during the critical period do not encompass every lawful example of grammatical structure relevant to the particular language.

For instance, consider that a child might hear the following examples:

  Who do you think that Jack will kiss first?
  Who do you think      Jack will kiss first?

From this, the child might determine that the word that is optional and from this analogize to the following examples:

  Who do you think      will kiss Jill first?
 *Who do you think that will kiss Jill first?

Clearly, the second example is not a grammatically well-formed sentence in English. A child knows this and does not form sentences such as the one marked by the asterisk. How does the child know, without being explicitly taught, that the ungrammatical example is, in fact, ungrammatical? From the linguistic perspective being described here, the answer to this question is that such knowledge pre-exists as part of UG.

Plato's Problem describes the disparity between input (poverty of the stimulus) and output (grammar). As Plato suggests in the Meno dialogue, the bridge between input (whether limited or lacking) and output is innate knowledge. Poverty of the stimulus is crucial to the Platonic argument and it is a linchpin concept in Chomskyan linguistics. For this reason, Plato's Problem is often used synonymously to mean poverty of the stimulus. Specific to linguistics, the formulation of this problem is evidence for the existence of universal grammar. Plato's Problem, as conceived here, informs much of the theory in this branch of linguistics.

===Perception and attention===
There have been studies of [[perception]] and [[attention]] that support the idea that there is an abundance of knowledge available to an individual at any given moment (Blake &amp; Sekuler, 2006).

====Visual====
A key ingredient to the beginning stages of perception requires the attention of the observer on some focal point or stimulus. There is a [[presupposition]] that if one visually perceives an object, one knows that one is seeing it (excluding the exception of perceptual illusions). Whatever sensory stimuli are attended to can be declared knowledge.

Stimuli that are directly attended to are projected onto the [[Fovea centralis|fovea]], the central point of the retina that corresponds to the focal point in visual space. To the immediate left and right of the focal point is the portion of visual space attributed to [[binocular vision]]. The far left and right of one's visual space is attributed to the monocular vision of the left and right eyes. In sum, one's visual space covers roughly 200° from the periphery of the left eye to the periphery of the right eye. This large visual space in human beings is a result of a fully developed and functioning anatomical visual system. In the context of Plato's Problem, our visual system is an innate capacity that enables us to be aware of a considerable portion of our immediate environment which enhances our conscious experience by supplementing it with an extensive environmental awareness and predisposing us to extract meaningful perceptual information. In other words, it is our biologically produced visual system that makes our perceptual experiences meaningful.

====Auditory====
Some examples from auditory perception research will be helpful in explaining the fact that our perceptual faculties naturally enhance and supplement our conscious experience. First, there is the "cocktail party phenomenon" (Moray, 1959). When someone is engaged in conversation with a group of people in a noisy room, but then they suddenly hear something or hear their name from across the room, when they were completely inattentive to the input before, that is the cocktail party phenomenon. This phenomenon also occurs with words associated with danger and sex. Although people may be inattentive to a portion of their environment, when they hear specific "trigger" words, their auditory capacities are redirected to another dimension of perceptual awareness. This shows that we do process information outside of our immediate conscious experience. Similar to visual perception, auditory perception also enhances and supplements our experience by searching out and extracting meaningful information from our environment.

The auditory findings are further concretized by research on shadowing tasks (Cherry, 1966). These tasks involve two distinct auditory messages presented simultaneously to both ears. One message in one ear is supposed to be shadowed (repeated) while the other message in the other ear is supposed to be ignored. Participants generally perform well at repeating familiar messages in the attended channel. However, when there was a significant change in [[frequency]] in the message in the unattended channel, it was detected; moreover, when their names were presented in the unattended channel, they noticed that as well. These shadowing tasks reinforce the idea that the gap between knowledge and experience is explained by our innate perceptual capacities that enhance our experience and optimize our knowledge gained from our environment.

====Subliminal priming====
There is also the subject of subliminal priming (Nisbett &amp; Ross, 1980), in which a stimulus is perceived outside of conscious awareness.  For example, in an experiment, half of a class was presented with a picture of a boy holding a birthday cake, while the other half was presented with a different picture of the same boy holding a birthday cake. The sole difference between the two was that in the first picture the boy had a mischievous facial expression, while in the second he conveyed an innocent smile. The photos were presented in a flash of 100 ms, then another picture was presented to both groups with the boy smiling. Results were that the first group described him as devilish and naughty, and the second group depicted him as angelic and kind. Due to the short presentation of the pictures, the subjects were not consciously aware of the nature of the original photos and when presented with them afterwards, participants were surprised.

These studies point to the fact that even though we only attend to and process limited information, we have a vast amount of knowledge at our disposal through our highly unrestricted sensory registers. It is the selective attention, perception, and higher order cognitive processing that limits these inputs and it is precisely these processes that make up our conscious awareness. Thus, in order to formulate some explanations for Plato's Problem, our conscious awareness limits our experience; nevertheless, it seems as though some stimuli that are sensed by our sensory registers, although seemingly rejected by conscious awareness, are actually retained and abstracted into our memories for further processing. All of our fully functioning perceptual faculties enhance, supplement, and optimize our experiences.

===Long-term memory (LTM)===

This LTM availability/accessibility dichotomy is analogous to a more contemporary explanation of Plato's doctrine of reminiscence, which postulates that an individual hedge as a result of information carried over from past lives. While evidence for or against [[immortality]] is outside the bounds of scientific research, one can see similarities between LTM availability/accessibility and the doctrine of reminiscence. LTM availability is highly unrestricted and practically unlimited as a storage system while LTM accessibility corresponds to what we can actually recall at any given moment. Plato, through his doctrine of reminiscence, would say that knowledge available through reminiscence is practically unrestricted but we are not cognizant of many of those ideas because they have yet to be recalled.

==Implications==
Having discussed Plato's philosophy, linguistics, perception, and some cognitive structures, various implications that arise from the research and theorizing can be touched on. The debate surrounding how to define knowledge goes back to the origin of humanity. In historical philosophy, the debate has been between [[rationalism]] and [[empiricism]]. In contemporary psychology, the debate is between biology (nature) and environment (nurture).

Rationalism is a philosophical and epistemological perspective on knowledge that claims, at its most extreme, that reason is the only dependable source of knowledge; moreover, rationalists assert that ''a priori'' knowledge is the most effective foundation for knowledge [http://www.philosophypages.com/dy/index.htm]. Empiricism, on the other hand, argues that no knowledge exists prior to experience; therefore, all knowledge, as well as thought, comes from experience. The [[nature and nurture]] debate is not identical, and yet has similarities, or parallels, to the rationalism versus empiricism debate. Those who claim that thought and behavior result from nature say the cause is genetic predisposition while those who argue for environment say that thought and behavior are caused by learning, parenting, and socialization.

In contemporary philosophical, linguistic, and psychological circles, it is rare that anyone maintains an unwavering stance on either of these extremes, most fall toward the middle. For many, the ideas of "nature and nurture" or "innateness and environmental input" are no longer perceived as mutually exclusive. For those who research such topics, much points to a necessarily interactive relationship in order for thought and behavior to occur.

In Plato's philosophy, innate ideas are revealed through the Socratic Method of investigation. In linguistics, universal grammar must have input from the environment (primary linguistic data) in order for children to achieve an individual grammar (output). Biologically, our perceptual faculties are pre-wired, but they require environmental stimuli in order to develop correctly. The neurological structures in our brain that represent the location of LTM are also biologically pre-wired, yet environmental input is needed in order for memory to flourish.

All of these ideas speak to the crux of Plato's Problem, which is how to account for the gap between knowledge and limited experience. For some scientific and philosophical disciplines, the answer to this conundrum is innateness, or biological pre-wiring. Innate knowledge is what bridges the gap between the limited information one gleans from the environment (poverty of the stimulus) and one's actual knowledge.

A '''speech-to-text reporter''' ('''STTR'''), also known as a '''captioner''', is a person who listens to what is being said and inputs it, word for word ([[wikt:verbatim|verbatim]]), using an electronic shorthand keyboard or speech recognition software and a CAT software system. Their keyboard or speech recognition software is linked to a computer, which converts this information to properly spelled words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.captions.org/2006/02/captioning-students-thoughts.html |title=Closed Captioning Web |publisher=Captions.org |date=2006-02-13 |accessdate=2009-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reproduced text could then be read by deaf or hard-of-hearing people.

The latest in speech-to-text reporters are called Voice writers.  Voicewriting is a method used for court reporting, and it is also used by some medical transcriptionists. Using the voicewriting method, a court reporter speaks directly into a stenomask or '''voice''' silencer—a hand-held mask containing one or two microphones and '''voice'''-dampening materials.  A voice writing system consists of a [[stenomask]], an external sound digitizer, a laptop, speech recognition software, and CAT software. A foot pedal can plug into a computer's USB port.

A real-time voice writer's words go through the mask's cable to an external USB digital signal processor, From there the words go into the computer's speech recognition engine, for conversion into streaming text. The reporter can send the streamed text to a) the Internet; b) a computer file; c) a television station for subtitling; d) to an end-user who is reading the captions via their laptop, tablet, smart phone, or e) software which formats the results in a way most familiar to judges, attorneys, or subtitling consumers.

Voice writers enjoy very high accuracy rates, based upon pure physiology. The route taken by a person's words goes from the mouth to the reporter's ear, brain, and "inner" voice. This form of repetition is naturally effortless; it is what we all do in our daily conversation, as we listen to a person speak, or when we read a book. So the most natural extension of this process is to psychologically switch the repetition mechanism from "inner voice" to the physiological "spoken voice." Therefore, we minimize the introduction of cognitive overhead in our task of routing the spoken word to its permanent destination as printed words. This streamlined process allows voice writers to achieve excellent performance for many continuous hours and greater than 98 percent accuracy at speeds as high as 350 words per minute.

Voice writers produce the same products as their stenotype colleagues, including transcripts in all electronic and printed formats. Realtime verbatim reporters connect their laptops to captioning equipment, real-time viewer programs, and provide attorneys or other clients with computer files at the end of the sessions. Only the physical way of capturing speakers' words differentiates voice writing from other methods of court reporting. Every other aspect of this profession is the same, with the exception of the time required to learn the skill, which is much shorter with voice writing.

Other ways of producing speech-to-text:  There are two types of keyboard used in the UK: the Palantype system and the [[Stenograph]] system. Hence STTRs are also sometimes referred to as '''palantypists''' and '''stenographers'''. Unlike a [[QWERTY]] keyboard, not every letter in a word is pressed, but several keys will be pressed at once which represent whole words, phrases or shortforms. Specially designed [[computer software]] will then convert these [[Phonetics|phonetic]] chords back into English which can then be displayed for someone to read.

The computer software can use a pre-programmed vocabulary specific to the context, information that matches syllable clusters to written forms, and may suggest alternative captions from which the STTR chooses.  Errors occur from the STTR mishearing the words and from the need for the STTR to make a decision before an ambiguous statement is made clear by what is said next.

The [[professional association]] for STTRs is the Association of Verbatim Speech-to-Text Reporters.  The Council for Advanced Communication with Deaf People and the Royal National Institute for the Deaf also give more information about STTRs.

== What will a service user see on the screen? ==
Every word that is spoken will appear on the screen in an accessible format, although one can request a change in the color and font size. As well as every word spoken, the words "NEW SPEAKER:" will typically appear to denote when the speaker changes. If one sends the STTR (voice writer/palantypist/stenographer) the names of people attending the conference or meeting before the event, they, too, can be programmed into the computer, making it easier for one to recognize who is speaking.  Other phrases, in curly brackets, may also appear, such as {laughter} or {applause}, to denote relevant events.

Occasional [[mondegreen]] errors may be seen in closed-captions when the computer software fails to distinguish where a word break occurs in the syllable stream.  For example, a news report of a "grand parade" might be captioned as a "grandpa raid". Mondegreens in this context arise from the need for captions to keep up with the fast pace of live television broadcasts.

== History ==
Many STTRs began their careers as [[court reporter]]s. In the courts, the system was used to record proceedings and provide transcripts when requested. The skills developed in this area have also made them invaluable in the field of communication with deaf people, as they are used to producing work with an extremely high degree of accuracy and acting with complete discretion at all times. An STTR expects to reach consistent levels of accuracy of 98.5% and above.

== Training==
In order to become an STTR one needs extensive training, typically two years, if a Palantype/Stenograph and the associated software, plus at least a further two years of practice, building up speed, accuracy, dictionary/vocabulary and gaining experience.

If becoming a [[Voice writer|voice writing STTR]], the training is somewhat shorter, though nevertheless, just as strenuous.  Two years to learn the art of voice writing includes the associated software and required practice, building up speed, accuracy, dictionary/vocabulary and gaining experience.

Only then is one ready to undertake the USA and/or UK Examinations for Certification.  In the USA, NVRA and NCRA offer certifications that demonstrate the necessary training.

There are many levels of certification.  NVRA certifies voice writers as court reporters, realtime reporters, CART providers, and broadcast captioners.  Beyond any licensing considerations, NVRA certification clearly demonstrates that the voice writer has attained a level of professionalism and skill well above that of others in the field.

'''Synchrony''' and '''diachrony''' are two different and complementary viewpoints in [[linguistic]] analysis. A synchronic approach (from Greek συν- "together" and χρόνος "time") considers a language at a moment in time without taking its history into account. Synchronic linguistics aims at describing a language at a specific point of time, usually the present. By contrast, a [[historic linguistics|diachronic]] approach (from δια- "through" and χρόνος "time") considers the development and evolution of a language through history. [[Historical linguistics]] is typically a diachronic study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=9027272077 |title=Synchrony and Diachrony: A dynamic interface |editor1-last=Giacalone Ramat |editor1-first=Anna |editor2-last=Mauri |editor2-first=Caterina |editor3-last=Molinelli |editor3-first=Piera |isbn=9027272077 |pages=17, 18 |publisher=John Benjamins North America |location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |date=2013 |access-date=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concepts were theorized by the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] linguist [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], professor of general linguistics in [[Geneva]] from 1896 to 1911, and appeared in writing in his posthumous ''[[Course in General Linguistics]]'' published in 1916. In contrast with most of his predecessors, who focused on historical evolution of languages, Saussure emphasized the primacy of synchronic analysis of languages to understand their inner functioning, though never forgetting the importance of complementary diachrony. This dualistic opposition has been carried over into [[philosophy]] and [[sociology]], for instance by [[Roland Barthes]] and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. [[Jacques Lacan]] also used it for [[psychoanalysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.ca/books/about/The_Four_Fundamental_Concepts_of_Psycho.html?id=5guFfqA6l0UC&amp;redir_esc=y|title=The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis |author-last=Lacan |author-first=Jacques |editor1-last=Miller |editor1-first=Jacques-Alain |isbn=0393317757 |pages=46 |publisher=Éditions du Seuil |location=France |date=1978 |access-date=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to de Saussure, many similar concepts were also developed independently by [[Poland|Polish]] linguists [[Jan Baudouin de Courtenay]] and [[Mikołaj Kruszewski]] of the [[Kazan school]], who used the terms '''statics''' and '''dynamics''' of language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.pl/books?id=BQfDosHckzEC&amp;pg=PA173&amp;lpg=PA173&amp;dq|title=The Oxford Handbook of the History of Linguistics |author-last=Allan |author-first=Keith  |isbn= 9780199585847 |pages=172 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=United Kingdom |date=2013 |access-date=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[linguistics]], '''syntax''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɪ|n|t|æ|k|s}}{{refn|{{OxfordDictionaries.com|accessdate=2016-01-22|syntax}}}}{{refn|{{MerriamWebsterDictionary|=2016-01-22|syntax}}}}) is the set of rules, principles, and processes that govern the structure of [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentences]] in a given [[Natural language|language]], usually including [[word order]]. The term ''syntax'' is also used  to refer to the study of such principles and processes.&lt;ref name="Chomsky def"&gt;{{cite book |last=Chomsky |first=Noam |year=2002 |origyear=1957 |title= Syntactic Structures |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=SNeHkMXHcd8C&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=%22syntax+is%22 11]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of many syntacticians is to discover the [[Universal grammar|syntactic rules]] common to all languages.

In mathematics, ''syntax'' refers to the rules governing the notation of mathematical systems, such as [[formal language]]s used in [[logic]]. (See [[Syntax (logic)|logical syntax]].)

== Etymology ==
The word ''syntax'' comes from [[Ancient Greek]]: {{wikt-lang|grc|σύνταξις}} "coordination", which consists of {{lang|grc|σύν}} ''syn'', "together", and {{lang|grc|τάξις}} ''táxis'', "an ordering".

==Sequencing of subject, verb, and object==

A basic feature of a language's syntax is the sequence in which the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] (S), [[verb]] (V), and [[object (grammar)|object]] (O) usually appear in sentences. Over 85% of languages usually place the subject first, either in the sequence [[subject-verb-object|SVO]] or the sequence [[subject-object-verb|SOV]]. The other possible sequences are [[verb-subject-object|VSO]], [[verb-object-subject|VOS]], [[object-verb-subject|OVS]], and [[object-subject-verb|OSV]], the last three of which are rare.

== Early history ==
Works on [[grammar]] were written long before modern syntax came about; in [[Ancient India|Ancient]] [[India]], the ''Aṣṭādhyāyī'' of [[Pāṇini]] (c. 4th century BC) is often cited as an example of a premodern work that approaches the sophistication of a modern syntactic theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fortson IV |first=Benjamin W. |title=Indo-European Language and Culture: An Introduction |publisher=Blackwell |year=2004 |isbn=978-1405188968 |page=186 |quote=[The ''Aṣṭādhyāyī''] is a highly precise and thorough description of the structure of Sanskrit somewhat resembling modern generative grammar...[it] remained the most advanced linguistic analysis of any kind until the twentieth century.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the West, the school of thought that came to be known as "traditional grammar" began with the work of [[Dionysius Thrax]].

For centuries, work in syntax was dominated by a framework known as {{lang|fr|grammaire générale}}, first expounded in 1660 by [[Antoine Arnauld]] in a book of the same title. This system took as its basic premise the assumption that language is a direct reflection of thought processes and therefore there is a single, most natural way to express a thought.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

However, in the 19th century, with the development of [[historical-comparative linguistics]], linguists began to realize the sheer diversity of human language and to question fundamental assumptions about the relationship between language and logic. It became apparent that there was no such thing as the most natural way to express a thought, and therefore [[logic]] could no longer be relied upon as a basis for studying the structure of language.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

The [[Port-Royal-des-Champs|Port-Royal grammar]] modeled the study of syntax upon that of logic. (Indeed, large parts of the [[Port-Royal Logic]] were copied or adapted from the ''Grammaire générale''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Arnauld |first=Antoine |title=La logique |year=1683 |edition=5th |location=Paris |publisher=G. Desprez |url=http://visualiseur.bnf.fr/Visualiseur?Destination=Gallica&amp;O=NUMM-57444 |quote={{lang|fr|Nous avons emprunté...ce que nous avons dit...d'un petit Livre...sous le titre de Grammaire générale.}} |pages=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Syntactic categories were identified with logical ones, and all sentences were analyzed in terms of "subject – copula – predicate". Initially, this view was adopted even by the early comparative linguists such as [[Franz Bopp]].

The central role of syntax within [[theoretical linguistics]] became clear only in the 20th century, which could reasonably be called the "century of syntactic theory" as far as linguistics is concerned. (For a detailed and critical survey of the history of syntax in the last two centuries, see the monumental work by Giorgio Graffi (2001)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Giorgio |first=Graffi |year= 2001 |url= https://books.google.com/books/about/200_Years_of_Syntax.html?id=mydolrE-PPkC |title= 200 Years of Syntax: A Critical Survey |format=googlebook preview |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing |isbn=9789027284570  }}&lt;/ref&gt;.)

== Theories ==
There are a number of theoretical approaches to the discipline of syntax. One school of thought, founded in the works of [[Derek Bickerton]],&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite book |title=Language and Species |author=Bickerton, Derek |year=1990 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=0-226-04610-9}} and, for more recent advances, {{cite book |title=Biological foundations and origin of syntax |editor1=Derek Bickerton |editor2=Eörs Szathmáry |year=2009 |publisher=[[MIT Press]] |isbn=978-0-262-01356-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; sees syntax as a branch of biology, since it conceives of syntax as the study of linguistic knowledge as embodied in the human [[mind]]. Other linguists (e.g., [[Gerald Gazdar]]) take a more [[Philosophy of mathematics#Platonism|Platonistic]] view, since they regard syntax to be the study of an abstract [[formal system]].&lt;ref&gt;Ted Briscoe, 2 May 2001, [http://www.informatics.susx.ac.uk/research/nlp/gazdar/briscoe/gpsg.html#SECTION00040000000000000000 Interview with Gerald Gazdar] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051122163306/http://www.informatics.susx.ac.uk/research/nlp/gazdar/briscoe/gpsg.html |date=2005-11-22 }}. Retrieved 2008-06-04.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet others (e.g., [[Joseph Greenberg]]) consider syntax a taxonomical device to reach broad generalizations across languages.

=== Generative grammar ===
{{Main|Generative grammar}}
The hypothesis of generative grammar is that language is a structure of the human mind. The goal of generative grammar is to make a complete model of this inner language (known as ''[[i-language]]''). This model could be used to describe all human language and to predict the [[grammaticality]] of any given utterance (that is, to predict whether the utterance would sound correct to native speakers of the language). This approach to language was pioneered by [[Noam Chomsky]]. Most generative theories (although not all of them) assume that syntax is based upon the constituent structure of sentences. Generative grammars are among the theories that focus primarily on the form of a sentence, rather than its communicative function.

Among the many generative theories of linguistics, the Chomskyan theories are:
* [[Transformational grammar]] (TG) (Original theory of generative syntax laid out by Chomsky in ''Syntactic Structures'' in 1957)&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, Noam. 1957. ''Syntactic Structures''. The Hague/Paris: Mouton, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Government and binding theory]] (GB) (revised theory in the tradition of TG developed mainly by Chomsky in the 1970s and 1980s)&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, Noam (1981/1993). Lectures on Government and Binding: The Pisa Lectures. Mouton de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Minimalist program]] (MP) (a reworking of the theory out of the GB framework published by Chomsky in 1995)&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, Noam (1995). The Minimalist Program. MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other theories that find their origin in the generative paradigm are:
* [[Arc pair grammar]]
* [[Generalized phrase structure grammar]] (GPSG; now largely out of date)
* [[Generative semantics]] (superseded by Semantic Syntax &lt;ref&gt;Seuren, P. A. M. 2018. ''Semantic Syntax''. Revised edition. Leiden: Brill&lt;/ref&gt;)
* [[Head-driven phrase structure grammar]] (HPSG)
* [[Lexical functional grammar]] (LFG)
* [[Nanosyntax]]&lt;!--Commenting out until explained: the link seems to be about something unrelated. HPSG and LFG also fall into the category of [[unification]] grammars.--&gt;
* [[Relational grammar]] (RG) (now largely out of date)

=== Dependency grammar ===
{{Main|Dependency grammar}}
[[Dependency grammar]] is an approach to sentence structure where syntactic units are arranged according to the dependency relation, as opposed to the constituency relation of [[phrase structure grammar]]s. Dependencies are directed links between words. The (finite) verb is seen as the root of all clause structure and all the other words in the clause are either directly or indirectly dependent on this root. Some prominent dependency-based theories of syntax are:

* [[Recursive categorical syntax]], or Algebraic syntax
* [[Functional generative description]]
* [[Meaning–text theory]]
* [[Operator grammar]]
* [[Word grammar]]

[[Lucien Tesnière]] (1893–1954) is widely seen as the father of modern dependency-based theories of syntax and grammar. He argued vehemently against the binary division of the clause into [[subject (grammar)|subject]] and [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]] that is associated with the grammars of his day (S → NP VP) and which remains at the core of most phrase structure grammars. In the place of this division, he positioned the verb as the root of all clause structure.&lt;ref&gt;Concerning Tesnière's rejection of the binary division of the clause into subject and predicate and in favor of the verb as the root of all structure, see Tesnière (1969:103–105).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Categorial grammar ===
{{Main|Categorial grammar}}
[[Categorial grammar]] is an approach that attributes the syntactic structure not to rules of grammar, but to the properties of the [[syntactic categories]] themselves. For example, rather than asserting that sentences are constructed by a rule that combines a noun phrase (NP) and a verb phrase (VP) (e.g., the [[phrase structure rule]] S → NP VP), in categorial grammar, such principles are embedded in the category of the [[head (linguistics)|head]] word itself. So the syntactic category for an [[intransitive]] verb is a complex formula representing the fact that the verb acts as a [[function word]] requiring an NP as an input and produces a sentence level structure as an output. This complex category is notated as (NP\S) instead of V. NP\S is read as "a category that searches to the left (indicated by \) for an NP (the element on the left) and outputs a sentence (the element on the right)." The category of [[transitive verb]] is defined as an element that requires two NPs (its subject and its direct object) to form a sentence. This is notated as (NP/(NP\S)) which means "a category that searches to the right (indicated by /) for an NP (the object), and generates a function (equivalent to the VP) which is (NP\S), which in turn represents a function that searches to the left for an NP and produces a sentence."

[[Tree-adjoining grammar]] is a categorial grammar that adds in partial [[tree structure]]s to the categories.

=== Stochastic/probabilistic grammars/network theories ===
Theoretical approaches to syntax that are based upon [[probability theory]] are known as [[stochastic grammar]]s. One common implementation of such an approach makes use of a [[neural network]] or [[connectionism]].

=== Functionalist grammars ===
{{main|Functional theories of grammar}}
Functionalist theories, although focused upon form, are driven by explanation based upon the function of a sentence (i.e., its communicative function). Some typical functionalist theories include:
* [[Cognitive grammar]]
* [[Construction grammar]] (CxG)
* [[Emergent grammar]]
* [[Functional discourse grammar]] (Dik)
* [[Prague linguistic circle]]
* [[Role and reference grammar]] (RRG)
* [[Systemic functional grammar]]

[[Image:Fire inside an abandoned convent in Massueville, Quebec, Canada.jpg|thumb|right|This building will be a "total loss" if its insurer determines that the cost of repairing it exceeds that of its insured value.]]
[[Image:Collision of Costa Concordia 5 crop.jpg|thumb|right|Even though only partially sunk in shallow water, in 2012 the relatively new cruise liner ''[[Costa Concordia]]'' was [[Costa Concordia disaster#Ship|declared]] a "constructive total loss" due to escalating environmental and salvage clean-up costs.]]

In [[insurance|insurance claims]], a '''total loss''' or '''write-off''' is a situation where the lost value, repair cost or [[Marine salvage|salvage]] cost of a damaged property exceeds its [[Insurance policy|insured value]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Business Dictionary: "Total Loss"|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/total-loss.html|work=Dictionary|publisher=BusinessDictionary.com|accessdate=January 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glossary of Insurance Terms|url=http://www.trafalgar-intl.com/definitions.htm|work=Dictionary|publisher=Trafalgar International, Ltd|accessdate=January 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Such a loss may be an "actual total loss" or a "constructive total loss". Constructive total loss considers further incidental expenses beyond repair, such as ''[[force majeure]]''. 

==General principles==
In a total loss, the insurer must indemnify the assured in full, and ownership of the insured item thereby passes to the insurer under the legal process of "[[subrogation]]".  Although the policy determines the level at which the loss becomes total rather than partial, nevertheless the assured (and NOT the insurer) has the final say as to whether he wishes to make a partial or total claim. 

If the insured item is, say, a car or a house, the policy will normally give it a "[[market value]]" which may be less than the assured had in mind; any disagreement would need to be challenged, perhaps using [[arbitration]]. In [[marine insurance]], policies may be valued (where the value of the ship or cargo is agreed) or unvalued (where a market value at the time of the claim would need to be ascertained).  In the absence of fraud, the [[Marine Insurance Act 1906]] states the agreed value in a valued policy is conclusive, except in cases of constructive total loss, as in ''[[Costa Concordia|The Costa Concordia]]'' and ''[[The Bamburi]]''.&lt;ref&gt; ''[[The Bamburi]]'' [1982] 1 Lloyd's Rep. 312&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Case report extract [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=G8sBdRAYzLQC&amp;pg=PA643&amp;lpg=PA643&amp;dq=the+bamburi+1982&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2Jxf6fhlBS&amp;sig=N8vbrfBV4vuuM5w6JUYx4ZnXgwk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwidhe3_k7_aAhUqDcAKHcayCNYQ6AEIMjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20bamburi%201982&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marine Insurance Law - Susan Hodges - Cavendish&lt;/ref&gt;

Written off properties are usually [[demolition|demolished]] or [[Teardown (real estate)|torn down]], [[Wrecking yard|scrapped]], or [[recycling|recycled]] for parts after their policies are settled; so the insurer may be relieved not to have the insured item surrogated to him, as in ''[[Asfar v Blundell]]'' [1896].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Asfar v Blundell]]'' [1896] 1 QB 123 &lt;/ref&gt;

Policies covering homes, vehicles, and other non-[[investment]] assets subject to [[depreciation]] may indemnify the insured to much less than the full replacement cost, so that the insured items may become "total losses" despite some residual value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What Is a Homeowners Insurance Depreciation?|url=http://budgeting.thenest.com/homeowners-insurance-depreciation-3626.html|publisher=TheNest.com|accessdate=January 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Property &amp; Casualty Insurance: total loss house fire|url=http://en.allexperts.com/q/Property-Casualty-Insurance-1544/2012/5/total-loss-house-fire.htm|publisher=AllExperts.com|accessdate=January 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Auto insurance==
{{main|Auto insurance}}

About one in seven [[Traffic collision|car accident]] claims results in a "total".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Crash Course for Coping With a Totaled Car|url=http://www.autotrader.com/research/article/car-news/168401/crash-course-for-coping-with-a-totaled-car.jsp|author=Russ Heaps|publisher=[[AutoTrader.com]]|accessdate=January 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Except in extreme circumstances, a vehicle that has been written off will not be completely worthless. This is because such a vehicle will usually still contain salvageable used parts, or at a bare minimum will still have value as scrap metal.  All that is required for a vehicle to be a write-off is that it would cost more to return to marketable condition than the market value it would then have.  So a vehicle of low value may even be written off when fully roadworthy, for example due to damage to paintwork or upholstery.

[[File:Escort wreck 006.jpg|thumb|A severely damaged automobile with repair costs greatly exceeding its value.]]
In many jurisdictions a vehicle designated as a total loss is sold by insurance companies to general public, auto dealers, auto brokers, or auto wreckers. The metrics insurance companies use to make the decision include the cost of the repairs needed plus the value of the remaining parts, added to the cost of reimbursing the driver for a rental while the car in question is repaired.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}&lt;!-- cite spam to coverhound.com a insurance shopping lead generation site removed --&gt; If this figure exceeds the value of the car after it is repaired, the vehicle is deemed a total loss. In most jurisdictions, a decision by an insurer to write off a vehicle results in [[vehicle title branding]], marking the car as "salvage" or (if repaired and reinspected under subsequent ownership) "rebuilt". If the vehicle is not severely damaged, however, it can be restored to its original condition. After a government approved inspection, the vehicle can be put back on the road. The inspection process may not attempt to assess the quality of the repairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wovi.com.au/FAQ.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160121174233/http://www.wovi.com.au/FAQ.aspx |archivedate=2016-01-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This function will be relegated to a professional mechanic or inspector. However, if the vehicle is severely damaged as per standards set by state or provincial governments, the vehicle is dismantled by an auto wrecker and is sold as parts or scrapped.

Once a vehicle has been written off and repaired the vehicle may still lose value. [[Diminished value]] is the reduction in a vehicle's market value occurring after a [[vehicle]] is wrecked and repaired, otherwise called [[Accelerated depreciation (automotive)|accelerated depreciation]]. To collect diminished value after a [[car accident]], [[insurance]] companies usually ask for a diminished value report.

In Canada, this is more commonly called ''accelerated depreciation''; how a person goes about reclaiming those losses in either country is a different process. In some US states, insurance companies acknowledge diminished value and provide this coverage direct to their consumers. In Canada, in order to recuperate the lost value after an accident, a person needs to retain legal counsel and order an acceleration depreciation report on their car for the court's use.

==Shipping==
{{main|Marine insurance}}

In marine insurance, [[Insurance|conventional marine insurers]] such as [[Lloyd's of London,|Lloyds]] will issue policies covering hull &amp; machinery, or cargo, whereas [[protection and indemnity insurance|P&amp;I clubs]] cover third-party risks (such as a carrier's damage to cargo), pollution risks, and war risks. The term "total loss" can refer to any of these risks, but commonly involves a loss of the hull or cargo. Total losses may be actual total loss or constructive.&lt;ref name="Wilhemsen" &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uio.no/studier/emner/jus/jus/JUS5402/h12/undervisningsmateriale/marininsurance_ii_tl_h12.pdf |title=Marine insurance, the individual type |last1=Wilhelmsen |first1=Trine-Lise (Professor)|publisher=Scandinavian Institute of Maritime Law |access-date=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

An '''actual total loss''' of a vessel occurs when repair is physically or legally impossible. A total loss may be presumed when a ship disappears and no news is received within a reasonable time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.duhaime.org/LegalDictionary/A/ActualTotalLoss.aspx|last1=Duhame|first1=Lloyd|website=Duhame.org Legal Dictionary|title=Actual Total Loss|access-date=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some legal authorities do not consider it an actual total loss if repair costs are merely prohibitive,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kennedyslaw.com/casereview/marineinsurance/|title=Venetico Marine SA v International General Insurance Company Ltd and others|date=27 February 2014|access-date=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others include cases where the cost of repair would exceed the cost of the vessel. In any case, the term "legally impossible" covers instances where reconstruction would be so extensive that the resulting craft would be legally considered a new vessel.&lt;ref name="Wilhemsen" /&gt;

A '''constructive total''' loss is a situation where the cost of repairs plus the cost of salvage equal or exceed the value of the vessel. It also covers cases where the vessel has been abandoned in the reasonable belief that a total loss is inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.duhaime.org/LegalDictionary/A/ConstructiveTotalLoss.aspx|last1=Duhame|first1=Lloyd|website=Duhame.org Legal Dictionary|title=Constructive Total Loss|access-date=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The calculation can be affected by environmental cleanup costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artemis.bm/blog/2013/12/29/costa-concordia-insured-loss-could-reach-2-billion/|title=Costa Concordia insured loss could reach $2 billion|website=Artemis.bm Catastrophe bonds, insurance linked securities, reinsurance capital &amp; investment, risk transfer intelligence|access-date=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the policy is a "valued" policy (so that the ship or cargo has an "agreed value" rather than a "market value"), then, in the absence of fraud, the agreed value is conclusive, but only for an actual total loss.  In a constructive total loss, the agreed value is NOT conclusive.&lt;ref&gt;Marine Insurance Act 1906&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aviation ==
{{main|Hull loss}}
[[File:L'America Ver sur mer.jpg|thumb|[[Richard E. Byrd|Richard Byrd]]'s Fokker [[America (aircraft)|"America"]] was completely written off after its forced ditching in the Atlantic in June 1927. Byrd and three others survived. The original destination [[Paris]] was socked in by fog making a landing impossible at LeBourget. Souvenir hunters stripped the aircraft of its fabric skin and other components.]]
In aviation, the term "hull loss" is used in [[aviation accident]]s that damage the aircraft beyond economical repair,&lt;ref name="gai"&gt;{{Cite book | doi = 10.1002/9780470744734.ch11| title = The Global Airline Industry| chapter = Chapter 11.

The term also applies to situations when the aircraft is missing, the search for its wreckage is terminated, or when the wreckage is completely inaccessible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Jones|first=Richard|title =20% Chance of Rain: Exploring the Concept of Risk| publisher =John Wiley &amp; Sons| year =2011 | &lt;!-- no page numeration, but accessible at Google Books --&gt; | isbn =1118116364}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''true name''' is a [[name]] of a thing or being that expresses, or is somehow identical to, its true [[Nature (philosophy)|nature]].  The notion that [[language]], or some specific [[sacred language]], refers to things by their true names has been central to philosophical study as well as various traditions of [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], religious [[invocation]] and mysticism ([[mantra]]s) since antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://paganwiccan.about.com/od/glossary/g/Magical_Name.htm Magical Name] (paganwiccan.about.com)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wicca-spirituality.com/wiccan-name.html Finding Your Wiccan Name] (wicca-spirituality.com)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical and religious contexts==
The true name of the Egyptian sun god [[Ra]] was revealed to [[Isis]] through an elaborate trick. This gave Isis complete power over Ra and allowed her to put her son Horus on the throne.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Geraldine (1981). ''Gods &amp; Pharaohs from Egyptian Mythology.'' London, England: Eurobook Limited. pp. 24–25. {{ISBN|0-87226-907-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Socrates]] in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'' considers, without taking a position, the possibility whether names are "conventional" or "natural" ("true name" [τῇ ἀληθείᾳ ὄνομα]), that is, whether language is a system of arbitrary signs or whether words have an intrinsic relation to the things they signify &lt;ref&gt;pp. 4 &amp; 18, [[David Sedley]], [http://assets.cambridge.org/052158/4922/sample/0521584922ws.pdf ''Plato's Cratylus''], Cambridge University Press 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; (this [[Conventionalism|anti-conventionalist]] position is called [[Cratylism]]).

[[Hellenistic Judaism]] emphasized the divine nature of ''[[logos]]'', later adopted by the [[Gospel of John]].  The true [[name of God]] plays a central role in [[Kabbalism]] (see [[Gematria]], [[Temurah (Kabbalah)|Temurah]], [[YHWH]] [the [[tetragrammaton]]]) and to some extent in [[Sufism]] (see [[100th name of God]]).
The ancient [[Jews]] considered God's true name so potent that its invocation conferred upon the speaker tremendous power over His creations.  To prevent abuse of this power, as well as to avoid blasphemy, the name of God was always [[taboo]], and increasingly disused so that by the time of [[Jesus]] their [[Kohen Gadol|High Priest]] was supposedly the only individual who spoke it aloud&amp;nbsp;— and then only in the [[Holy of Holies]] upon the [[Day of Atonement]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Stuart Gordon, ''The Encyclopedia of Myths and Legends'', pp. 480-1, Headline Book Publishing, London, 1993 {{ISBN|0-7472-3936-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in a Biblical context, in the tale of [[Jacob]]'s nocturnal [[Jacob wrestling with the angel|wrestling with an anonymous angel]], the angel refuses to reveal his own name to Jacob even after the angel's submission at dawn.  Thereafter Jacob obtains a new name which signifies his successful struggle to God and man, and names the place to commemorate his surviving an encounter with the Divine.&lt;ref&gt;Genesis 32:22-31&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary pre-industrial peoples guard secret names which are only used in solemn rituals.  These names are never mentioned and kept from general knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Frazer, James, "Tabooed Words" in ''The Golden Bough'', first volume abridged edition, (New York: Mentor, 1959), pages 235-246&lt;/ref&gt;

==Folklore and Literature==
In Jewish tradition, when several children have died in a family the next that is born has no name given to it, but is referred to as "[[Alter (name)|Alter]]" ({{lang-yi|אלטער}}, literally "old"), or ''Alterke'', the view being that the [[Angel of Death]]{{dn|date=November 2018}}, not knowing the name of the child, will not be able to seize it. When such a child attains the marriageable age, a new name, generally that of one of the Patriarchs, is given to it. 

When captured by [[Polyphemus]], [[Homer]]'s [[Odysseus]] is careful not to reveal his name; when asked for it, Odysseus tells the giant that he is "[[Outis|Οὖτις]]", which means "nobody"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0073%3Aentry%3Dou%29%2Ftis οὔτις] and [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0073%3Aentry%3D*ou%29%3Dtis Οὖτις], Georg Autenrieth, ''A Homeric Dictionary'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;. But later, having escaped after blinding Polyphemus and thinking himself beyond Polyphemus' power, Odysseus boastfully reveals his real name, an act of [[hubris]] that was to cause enormous problems later. Knowing his name, Polyphemus was able to call upon Odysseus the revenge of his father, the god [[Poseidon]]. Many later episodes of the [[Odyssey]] depict Odysseus facing the relentless hostility of Poseidon - which he could have avoided had he persisted in keeping his real name secret.   
 
According to practises in [[folklore]], referred to as 'the Law of Names'; knowledge of a true name allows one to affect another person or being [[Magic (paranormal)|magically]].&lt;ref&gt;Philip Martin, ''The Writer's Guide to Fantasy Literature: From Dragon's Lair to Hero's Quest'', p 134, {{ISBN|0-87116-195-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is stated that knowing someone's, or something's, true name therefore gives the person (who knows the true name) power over them. This effect is used in many tales,&lt;ref&gt;Maria Tatar, ''The Annotated Brothers Grimm'', p 260 W. W. Norton &amp; company, London, New York, 2004 {{ISBN|0-393-05848-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as in the German fairytale of ''[[Rumpelstiltskin]]'': within Rumpelstiltskin and all its variants, the girl can free herself from the power of a supernatural helper who demands her child by learning its name.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Tatar, p 128, ''The Annotated Classic Fairy Tales'', {{ISBN|0-393-05163-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A legend of [[Saint Olaf]] recounts how a [[troll]] built a church for the saint at a fantastic speed and price, but the saint was able to free himself by learning the troll's name during a walk in the woods.&lt;ref&gt;Francis James Child, ''[[Child Ballads|The English and Scottish Popular Ballads]]'', v 1, p 95, Dover Publications, New York 1965&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the belief that children who were not baptised at birth were in particular danger of having the [[fairy|fairies]] kidnap them and leave [[changeling]]s in their place may stem from their unnamed state.&lt;ref&gt;K. M. Briggs, ''The Fairies in English Tradition and Literature'', p 115 University of Chicago Press, London, 1967&lt;/ref&gt; In the Scandinavian variants of the ballad ''[[Earl Brand]]'', the hero can defeat all his enemies until the heroine, running away with him, pleads with him by name to spare her youngest brother.&lt;ref&gt;Francis James Child, ''The English and Scottish Popular Ballads'', v 1, p 91, Dover Publications, New York 1965&lt;/ref&gt;

In Scandinavian beliefs, more magical beasts, such as the [[Neck (water spirit)|Nix]], could be defeated by calling their name.&lt;ref&gt;Francis James Child, ''The English and Scottish Popular Ballads'', v 1, p 95-6, Dover Publications, New York 1965&lt;/ref&gt; For the same reason significant objects in Germanic mythology, which were considered to have some kind of intrinsic personality, had their own names too, for example the legendary Sword [[Balmung]].

Medieval beliefs about [[witchcraft]] indicated that the [[Devil]] baptized witches with a new, secret name.

In the folklore of Northern England, there was the belief that a [[boggart]] should never be named, for when the boggart was given a name, it would not be reasoned with nor persuaded, but would become uncontrollable and destructive.

[[Giacomo Puccini]] used a similar theme in the opera [[Turandot]]. The plot turns on whether or not Princess Turandot could learn the name of her unwanted suitor. If she does, she could execute him; if she doesn't, she would have to marry him.

==In cryptography==
The term "true name" is sometimes used in [[cryptography]] and [[computer security]] to refer to a name that is assumed to uniquely identify a principal in a global namespace (for example, an [[X.500]] or [[X.509]] [[Distinguished Name|Distinguished name]]). This usage is often critical, with the implication that use of true names is difficult to enforce and unwise to rely on.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} &lt;!-- possible ref: Cryptography and the Politics of One's True Name, Leonard N. Foner (in True Names: And the Opening of the Cyberspace Frontier) -- but I haven't actually read it --&gt;

==In popular culture==
In [[fantasy]] where magic works by evoking true names, characters often go to great lengths to conceal their true names. In some settings, such as [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]'s ''[[Earthsea (book series)|Earthsea]]'', this is true for all beings. In others, as in [[Larry Niven]]'s ''[[The Magic Goes Away]]'', it applies only to those of magical inclination, as where a wizard is revived from the dead only by another who found his name, and even then only with great difficulty. Finding a true name may require arcane procedures. In ''Earthsea'', a wizard must listen for and give the hero his true name; this is performed in both Le Guin's ''[[A Wizard of Earthsea]]'' and ''[[The Tombs of Atuan]]''.

*In Arthur C. Clarke's ''[[The Nine Billion Names of God]]'', when all of God's names are discovered by Tibetan monks, the universe ends.
*In [[Glen Cook|Glen Cook's]] ''[[The Black Company|Black Company]]'' series, speaking a sorcerer's true name aloud can snuff out their magical power. All the magic users in the series are referred to by pseudonyms, and many of them went to great lengths to kill anyone who knew their original names.
*In [[Christopher Paolini|Christopher Paolini's]] ''[[Inheritance Cycle]]'', magicians can control someone by learning their true name, and use the true name of inanimate objects in spells. 
*[[Patricia Wrede]], in her novel ''[[Snow-White and Rose-Red]]'', has a character not succumb to a spell because the caster did not know the name he was baptized by.
*[[Patricia McKillip]], in her novel ''[[The Forgotten Beasts of Eld]]'', wizards, including the main character Sybel, can call people and creatures using their true name.
*In ''[[Operation Chaos (novel)|Operation Chaos]]'', [[Poul Anderson]] has the doctor who delivers a baby issue not only a regular birth certificate, but a secret one, with the newborn's name; the hero, born before such precautions were routine, is glad to hide his daughter's true name. 
*In the ''[[Bartimaeus Trilogy]]'' by [[Jonathan Stroud]], a magician cannot have full control over a demon if the demon knows the magician's true name. As a result, all magicians have records of their true names destroyed during childhood and take a new name around adolescence.  
*In [[Rick Riordan]]'s ''[[The Kane Chronicles]]'', all people and gods also have true names which give great but not total power over them. ''[[The Lightning Thief]]'', a previous novel of Riordan's, also emphasizes on the importance of using names, particularly the names of gods.
*In [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Hobbit]]'', [[Bilbo Baggins]] uses a great deal of trickery to keep the dragon,  [[Smaug]], from learning his name; even the sheltered hobbit realizes that revealing his name would be very foolish.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Tatar, ''The Annotated Brothers Grimm'', p 261 W. W. Norton &amp; company, London, New York, 2004 {{ISBN|0-393-05848-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
*Likewise, in Ursula K. Le Guin's ''Earthsea'' canon, and specifically in her seminal short story "[[The Rule of Names]]", knowledge of a dragon's or human's true name confers power over them.&lt;ref&gt;Spivack, Charlotte, ''Ursula K. Le Guin'', (Boston: Twayne Publishers, 1984), page 27.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*True names and [[The Speech (fiction)|speech]] are the basis for magic in [[Diane Duane]]'s ''[[Young Wizards]]'' series. 
*The dragons of ''[[Deltora Quest (series)|Deltora Quest]]'' believe that knowledge of their true name gives others power over them, and will thus only reveal it to trusted confidants or in dire need.
*The concept is also prominently present in  ''[[The Kingkiller Chronicle]]'' by Patrick Rothfuss.&lt;ref&gt;Rothfuss, Patrick:The Name of the Wind, 27 March 2007, DAW Books Hardcover {{ISBN|978-0-7564-0407-9}}, pages=662}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Lloyd Alexander]]'s ''[[The Chronicles of Prydain]]'' utilizes the concept as well.
*Multiple variants of magic utilizing or grounded in the power of true names have appeared in the ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' [[role-playing game]], though never as a bedrock element of the game.

*In the Cold Cereal Trilogy true names were used to control a person. Nimue (the Lady of the Lake) used it to freeze people.

''[http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/trapTheSoul.htm Trap the Soul]'' is one such example, where knowledge of a true name allows the capture of even those immune to magic.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the role-playing setting [[World of Darkness|One World of Darkness]], the concept of True Names is very expansive. The True Name of a being is like a platonic blueprint to the creature. A human's True Name can even change after life-altering events. It is a description of the being, from its internal organs to its very soul. All living creatures have one, but those with more intelligence have more complex True Names. A [[Fallen angel|Fallen]] has a True Name given directly by God, but they are unpronouncable by mortal tongues because they are not words or names in the traditional sense; rather, they are a collection of abstract sounds and concepts, such as the sound of a hundred children laughing at once or the wind whistling over the entrance of a cavern. A Fallen's Celestial Name will suffice to fill out the power a True Name has over other beings. Magic is also easier to cast and stronger against a target whose True Name is known.
*In [[Jim Butcher]]'s ''[[The Dresden Files]]'' a wizard or other magical being can gain power over anyone by knowing their name, if the invoker has heard it spoken by its owner; however, as humans' names change with their nature, their magical power generally decays after a time.
*In the ''Doctor Who'' episode "[[The Shakespeare Code]]", the Carrionites are a species of witch-like beings who use words as a form of magic power. Particularly potent is someone's name, but it will only work once. The Doctor repels the Carrionites at one point using their name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Language of Doctor Who|date=May 2014|publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]]|isbn=978-1-4422-3481-9|page=126|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ImuYAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA126&amp;ots=3JybWyieMo&amp;dq=doctor%20who%20carrionites%20and%20the%20power%20of%20names&amp;pg=PA126#v=onepage&amp;q=doctor%20who%20carrionites%20and%20the%20power%20of%20names&amp;f=false|accessdate=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that the Doctor's true name must never be said or "silence will fall".
*In the [[manga]] series ''[[Bleach (manga)|Bleach]]'', a [[shinigami]] (death god) must learn the true name of his or her sword, known as a [[zanpakutou]].
*In the television series ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'', recurring antagonist [[Mr. Gold|Rumplestiltskin]] (portrayed by [[Robert Carlyle]]) stresses on the importance of using someone or something's proper name.
*In the book series The Symphony of Ages by Elizabeth Haydon, the main character Rhapsody is a bard who discovers the gift of True Naming, giving her the ability to do many wondrous things such as changing a person's nature, freeing them of magical slavery or granting them new supernatural abilities to even camouflaging a group of adventurers in plantlife to avoid detection by assassins and bandits.
*In the book series Skulduggery Pleasant by Derek Landy, every person has a name that they choose which is used to protect their other names: a name that is given to them at birth which can be used to control a person to a limited extent and a true name which can be used to control that person to an unlimited degree.
*In Superman comics, the 5th-dimensional imp Mr. Mxyzptlk can be banished from our dimension if he is tricked into reciting his own name backwards (Kltpzyxm).      
*The [[SCP Foundation]] object "Taboo" is described as a location containing objects and beings capable of appearing when their names are said and stealing the names of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scp-wiki.net/taboo|title=[REDACTED PER PROTOCOL 4000-ESHU] - SCP Foundation|last=|first=PeppersGhost|date=|website=www.scp-wiki.net|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A character remembering their true name may be an important means of maintaining mastery of their own life. In [[Hayao Miyazaki]]'s movie ''[[Spirited Away]]'', the witch who runs the bathhouse, Yubaba, ensures loyalty by stealing the names of her subjects. For example, one of the witch's most loyal subjects, the spirit of the Kohaku River, has his name taken and is given a slave name: Haku. He forgets his name, and it is in this way 'taken' from him; he warns [[Chihiro Ogino]] against the dangers of forgetting her own name. She frees him when she recognises him and he then remembers and 'takes back' his name and is freed from the clutches of the witch.

In the [[cyberpunk]] genre following [[Vernor Vinge]]'s 1981 ''[[True Names]]'' and the work of [[William Gibson]], much of the plot involved interactions between people's virtual selves in [[cyberspace]].  Learning a fellow hacker's real-world name (i.e., their "true name") could allow you to turn them in to the government or otherwise blackmail them, conveying a kind of power that could be considered analogous to the equivalent concept of myth and legend.

A '''turn construction unit''' (TCU) is the fundamental segment of speech in a conversation, as analyzed in [[conversation analysis]].

The idea was introduced in (Sacks, Schegloff, &amp; Jefferson 1974) and is meant to describe pieces of conversation which may comprise an entire turn. The end of a TCU, called a ''transition relevance place'' (TRP), marks a point where the turn may go to another speaker, or the present speaker may continue with another TCU.

== Turn Construction Unit (TCU) ==
A '''Turn Construction Unit (TCU)''' is a building component of a turn in a conversation. It is a unit of conversation that completes a communicative act.

=== Types of TCU ===

There are four types of TCU categorized by the roles they play in the utterance:

1. '''Lexical TCU''': e.g. "Yes", "There"&lt;br /&gt;
2. '''Phrasal TCU''': e.g. "In the basket", "out of here"&lt;br /&gt;
3. '''Clausal TCU''': e.g. "When I am free", "If I got the job"&lt;br /&gt;
4. '''Sentential TCU''': e.g. "I am working on my thesis", "He has got my car"

=== Criteria for Turn Construction Unit ===
A general rule to identify a TCU would be to look for a possible completion in an ongoing utterance. There are three criteria to determine what constitutes a TCU:&lt;br /&gt;
1. '''Intonationally Complete''': This means the utterance is at a possible point of completion with the hint of a falling tone, signaling the possible ending of the utterance.&lt;br /&gt;
2. '''Grammatically Complete''': This means the utterance is at a possible point of completion with a hint of its syntactic completeness, i.e. it signals the end of a sentence in terms of its grammatical structure.&lt;br /&gt;
3. '''Pragmatically Complete''': This means the utterance is seen to have possibly accomplished its purpose in response to the situation during a conversation. For example, the utterance "She is really" can be seen as pragmatically complete in response to the exclamation, "That girl is really pretty!", in the sense that it functions as an agreement to the previous comment.

Scholars in the field of conversation analysis have debated over the relative significance of the above three criteria as signifiers of the end of an utterance. There are, however, no conclusive answer to the discussion, and one can classify a TCU as such when observing either one (or more) of the above features.

== Transition Relevance Place (TRP)==
'''Transition Relevance Place''' (or TRP) is a point of possible completion (or potential end) of an utterance (hence a TCU) where speaker change is a possible next action.

[[File:KellsFol309r.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.36|The [[Book of Kells]], c. AD 800, is lettered in a script known as "insular majuscule", a variety of uncial script that originated in Ireland.]]
'''Uncial''' is a [[majuscule]]&lt;ref name=gl&gt;[[Geoffrey Glaister|Glaister, Geoffrey Ashall]]. (1996) ''Encyclopedia of the Book''. 2nd edn. New Castle, DE, and London: Oak Knoll Press &amp; [[The British Library]], p. 494. {{ISBN|1884718140}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[script (styles of handwriting)|script]] (written entirely in capital letters) commonly used from the 4th to 8th centuries AD by [[Latin]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Greek]] [[scribe]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''The Cambridge Encyclopedia of The English Language''. Ed. [[David Crystal]]. Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press]], 1995. p. 258.&lt;/ref&gt; Uncial letters were used to write [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Latin]], and [[Gothic language|Gothic]].

==Development==
[[File:Evolution of minuscule.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.36|Simplified relationship between various scripts, showing the development of Uncial from Roman and the Greek Uncial.]]
Early uncial script is likely to have developed from late [[Old Roman cursive]]. Early forms are characterized by broad single stroke [[Letter (alphabet)|letter]]s using simple round forms taking advantage of the new [[parchment]] and [[vellum parchment|vellum]] surfaces, as opposed to the angular, multiple stroke letters, which are more suited for rougher surfaces, such as [[papyrus]]. In the oldest examples of uncial, such as the fragment of ''[[Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 30|De bellis macedonicis]]''  in the [[British Library]], of the late 1st-early 2nd century,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/FullDisplay.aspx?ref=Papyrus_745 British Library Mss]&lt;/ref&gt; all of the letters are disconnected from one another, and word separation is typically not used. Word separation, however, is characteristic of later uncial usage.

As the script evolved over the centuries, the characters became more complex. Specifically, around AD 600, flourishes and exaggerations of the basic strokes began to appear in more manuscripts. [[Ascender (typography)|Ascenders]] and [[descender]]s were the first major alterations, followed by twists of the tool in the basic stroke and overlapping. By the time the more compact [[Lower case|minuscule]] scripts arose circa AD 800, some of the evolved uncial styles formed the basis for these simplified, smaller scripts. Uncial was still used, particularly for copies of the [[Bible]], tapering off until around the 10th century. There are over 500 surviving copies of uncial script, by far the largest number prior to the [[Carolingian Renaissance]].

==Forms==
[[File:Codex bezae latin.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.36|A sample of the Latin text from the [[Codex Bezae]]]]

In general, there are some common features of uncial script:

* {{angle bracket|f}}, {{angle bracket|i}}, {{angle bracket|p}}, {{angle bracket|s}}, {{angle bracket|t}} are relatively narrow.
* {{angle bracket|m}}, {{angle bracket|n}} and {{angle bracket|u}} are relatively broad; {{angle bracket|m}} is formed with curved strokes (although a straight first stroke may indicate an early script), and {{angle bracket|n}} is written as {{angle bracket|ɴ}} to distinguish it from {{angle bracket|r}} and {{angle bracket|s}}.
* {{angle bracket|e}} is formed with a curved stroke, and its arm (or ''hasta'') does not connect with the top curve; the height of the arm can also indicate the age of the script (written in a high position, the script is probably early, while an arm written closer to the middle of the curve may indicate a later script).
* {{angle bracket|l}} has a small base, not extending to the right to connect with the next letter.
* {{angle bracket|r}} has a long, curved shoulder {{angle bracket|{{MUFI|&amp;#xA783;}}}}&lt;!--?--&gt;, often connecting with the next letter.
* {{angle bracket|s}} resembles (and is the ancestor of) the "[[long s]]" {{angle bracket|ſ}}; in uncial it {{angle bracket|{{MUFI|&amp;#xA785;}}}} looks more like {{angle bracket|r}} than {{angle bracket|f}}.

In later uncial scripts, the letters are sometimes drawn haphazardly; for example, {{angle bracket|ll}} runs together at the baseline, bows (for example in {{angle bracket|b}}, {{angle bracket|p}}, {{angle bracket|r}}) do not entirely curve in to touch their stems, and the script is generally not written as cleanly as previously.

==National styles==
Due to its extremely widespread use, in [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]], [[North Africa in the Roman era|Africa]]n, [[Italy in the Middle Ages|Italian]], [[France in the Middle Ages|French]], [[Spain in the Middle Ages|Spanish]], and "insular" ([[Early Christian Ireland|Irish]], [[Wales in the Early Middle Ages|British]] and [[England in the Early Middle Ages|English]]) centres, there were many slightly different styles in use:

*African (i.e. [[North Africa during the Classical Period|Roman North Africa]]n) uncial is more angular than other forms of uncial. In particular, the bow of the letter {{angbr|a}} is particularly sharp and pointed.
*Byzantine uncial has two unique features: "b-d uncial" uses forms of {{angbr|b}} and {{angbr|d}}, which are closer to half-uncial (see below), and was in use in the 4th and 5th centuries; "b-r" uncial, in use in the 5th and 6th centuries, has a form of {{angbr|b}} that is twice as large as the other letters, and an {{angbr|r}} with a bow resting on the baseline and the stem extending below the baseline.
*Italian uncial has round letters ({{angbr|c}}, {{angbr|e}}, {{angbr|o}} etc.) with flatter tops, and a with a sharp bow (as in African uncial), an almost horizontal rather than vertical stem in {{angbr|d}}, and forked finials (i.e., [[serif]]s in some letters such as {{angbr|f}}, {{angbr|l}}, {{angbr|t}} and {{angbr|s}}).
*Insular uncial (not to be confused with the separate [[insular script]]) generally has definite word separation, and accent marks over stressed syllables, probably because Irish scribes did not speak a language descended from Latin. They also use specifically Insular [[scribal abbreviation]]s not found in other uncial forms, use wedge-shaped [[finial]]s, connect a slightly subscript "pendant {{angbr|i}}" with {{angbr|m}} or {{angbr|h}} (when at the end of a word), and decorate the script with animals and dots ("Insular dotting", often in groups of three).
*French (that is, [[Merovingian]]) uncial uses thin descenders (in {{angbr|g}}, {{angbr|p}} etc.), an {{angbr|x}} with lines that cross higher than the middle, and a {{angbr|d}} with a curled stem (somewhat resembling an apple), and there are many decorations of fish, trees, and birds.
*{{Anchor|ustav|semi-ustav|poluustav}}[[Cyrillic]] manuscript developed from Greek uncial in the late ninth century (mostly replacing the [[Glagolitic alphabet]]), and was originally used to write the [[Old Church Slavonic]] liturgical language. The earlier form was called ''ustav'' (predominant in the 11–14th centuries), and later developed into ''semi-ustav'' script (or ''[[poluustav]]'', 15–16th centuries).

==Etymology==
[[File:Schriftzug Unziale.svg|thumb|upright=1.36|Calligraphic writing of the word "Unziale" in a modern uncial hand]]There is some doubt about the original meaning of the word. ''Uncial'' itself probably comes from [[St. Jerome]]'s preface to the [[Book of Job]], where it is found in the form ''uncialibus'', but it is possible that this is a misreading of ''inicialibus'' (though this makes little sense in the context), and Jerome may have been referring to the larger initial letters found at the beginning of paragraphs.
:''Habeant qui volunt veteres libros, vel in membranis purpureis auro argentoque descriptos, vel '''uncialibus''' ut vulgo aiunt litteris onera magis exarata quam codices.''
:"Let those who so desire have old books, or books written in gold and silver on [[purple parchment]], or burdens {rather than books} written in uncial letters, as they are popularly called."

In classical Latin ''uncialis'' could mean both "inch-high" and "weighing an ounce", and it is possible that Jerome was punning on this; he may conceivably also have been playing with the other meaning of ''codex'', "block of wood".

The term ''uncial'' in the sense of describing this script was first used by [[Jean Mabillon]] in the early 18th century. Thereafter his definition was refined by [[Scipione Maffei]], who used to refer to this script as distinct from [[Roman square capitals]].

==Other uses==
[[File:Codex sinaticus.jpg|thumb|A portion of the [[Codex Sinaiticus]], in Byzantine uncial, containing [[Book of Esther|Esther]] 2:3–8.]]
The word, ''uncial'', is also sometimes used to refer to manuscripts that have been scribed in uncial, especially when differentiating from those penned with minuscule. Some of the most noteworthy Greek uncials are:
* [[Codex Sinaiticus]]
* [[Codex Vaticanus]]
* [[Codex Alexandrinus]]
*: — these being three of what are often called the four [[great uncial codices]]
* [[Codex Bezae]]
* [[Codex Petropolitanus Purpureus]]

The Petropolitanus is considered by some to contain optimum uncial style. It is also an example of how large the characters were getting.

For further details on these manuscripts, see Guglielmo Cavallo ''Ricerche sulla Maiuscola Biblica'' (Florence, 1967).

Modern [[calligraphy]] usually teaches a form of evolved Latin-based uncial hand that would probably be best compared to the later 7th to 10th century examples, though admittedly, the variations in Latin uncial are much wider and less rigid than Greek. Modern uncial has borrowed heavily from some of the conventions found in more [[cursive]] scripts, using flourishes, variable width strokes, and on occasion, even center axis tilt.

In a way comparable to the continued widespread use of the [[blackletter]] [[typeface]]s for written [[German language|German]] until well into the 20th century, [[Gaelic type|Gaelic]] letterforms, which are similar to uncial letterforms, were conventionally used for typography in [[Irish language|Irish]] until the 1950s. The script is still widely used in this way for titles of documents, inscriptions on monuments and other 'official' uses. Strictly speaking, the Gaelic script is [[Insular script|insular]], not uncial. Uncial Greek (commonly called "Byzantine lettering" by Greeks themselves) is commonly used by the [[Greek Orthodox Church]] and various institutions and individuals in [[Greece]] to this day. The Modern Greek State has also used uncial script on several occasions in official capacity (such as on seals, government documents etc.) as did many of the Greek provisional governments during the [[Revolution|Greek War of Independence]]. The height of uncial usage by the Modern Greek State was during the [[Greek military junta of 1967–74]], when even [[Greek Drachma]] coins had uncial lettering on them. Since the [[Metapolitefsi]], the Greek State has stopped using uncial script.

==Half-uncial==
The term ''half-uncial'' or ''semi-uncial'' was first deployed by Scipione Maffei, ''Istoria diplomatica'' (Mantua, 1727); he used it to distinguish what seemed like a cut-down version of uncial in the famous ''Codex Basilicanus'' of Hilary, which contains sections in each of the two types of script. The terminology was continued in the mid-18th century by [[René Prosper Tassin]] and [[Charles François Toustain]]. Despite the common and well-fixed usage, half-uncial is a poor name to the extent that it suggests some organic debt to regular uncial, though both types share features inherited from their ancient source.  See now:  L. E. Boyle, "'Basilicanus' of Hilary Revisited," in ''Integral Palaeography'', with an introduction by F. Troncarelli (Turnhout, 2001), 105-17.

Like uncial, half-uncial derived from Roman cursive, but now of a later, evolved type. It was first used around the 3rd century and remained in use until the end of the 8th century. The early forms of half-uncial were used for pagan authors and Roman legal writing, while in the 6th century the script came to be used in Africa and Europe (but not as often in insular centres) to transcribe Christian texts.

===Half-uncial forms===
Some general forms of half-uncial letters are:
* {{angbr|a}} is usually round {{angbr|ɑ}}, sometimes with a slightly open top
* {{angbr|b}} and {{angbr|d}} have vertical stems, identical to the modern letters
* {{angbr|g}} has a flat top, no bow, and a curved descender {{angbr|ᵹ}} (somewhat resembling the digit 5)
* {{angbr|t}} has a curved shaft {{angbr|ꞇ}}
* {{angbr|n}}, {{angbr|r}} and {{angbr|s}} are similar to their uncial counterparts (with the same differences compared to modern letters)

Half-uncial was brought to Ireland in the 5th century, and was then carried to England. There, it was used up to the 8th century, and developed into the [[insular script]] after the 8th century.

This article lists some vocabulary of [[Vulgar Latin]].

== Historical overview ==
[[File:St Jerome by Rubens dsc01653.jpg|thumb|200px|upright|right|[[Jerome|St. Jerome]], whose commentaries on the Bible are a source of Vulgar Latin. Painting by [[Peter Paul Rubens]].]]
Like all languages, Latin possessed numerous synonyms that were associated with different [[Register (language)|speech registers]]. Some of these words were in the everyday language from the time of [[Old Latin]], while others were borrowed late into Latin from other languages: [[Germanic languages|Germanic]], [[Gaulish language|Gaulish]], the [[Paleo-Balkan languages]] preceding [[Eastern Romance languages|Eastern Romance]] etc. Certain words customarily used in Classical Latin were not used in Vulgar Latin, such as ''equus'', "[[horse]]". Instead, Vulgar Latin typically featured ''caballus'' "nag" (but note Romanian ''iapă'', Sardinian ''èbba'', Spanish ''yegua'', Catalan ''euga'' and Portuguese ''égua'' all meaning "mare" and deriving from Classical ''equa'').

The differences applied even to the basic [[grammatical particle]]s; many classical have no reflex in Romance, such as ''an, at, autem, dōnec, enim, ergō, etiam, haud, igitur, ita, nam, postquam, quidem, quīn, quod, quoque, sed, utrum'' and ''vel''.&lt;ref name="Harrington"&gt;Harrington et al. (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; Verbs with prefixed prepositions frequently displaced simple forms. The number of words formed by such productive [[suffix]]es as ''-bilis'', ''-ārius'', ''-itāre'' and ''-icāre'' grew apace.

Some Romance languages preserve Latin words that were lost in most others. For example, Italian ''ogni'' ("each/every") and Sardinian ''ondzi'' continue Latin ''omnes''. Elsewhere the gap is filled by reflexes of Greek κατά or evolved forms of ''tōtus'' (originally "entire") for a similar meaning; Occitan/Portuguese/Spanish '' cada'' 'each, every', ''tudo''/''todo'' in Portuguese, ''todo'' in Spanish, ''tot'' in Catalan, ''tout'' in French and ''tot'' in Romanian.  The plural ''tutti'' in Italian means "all, every" and can overlap in meaning with ''ogni'' (''ogni giorno'' and ''tutti i giorni'' both mean "every day"), and the singular ''tutto'' still means "entire" as well as "all".

Sometimes a Classical Latin word appears in a Romance language alongside the equivalent Vulgar Latin word: classical ''caput'', "head", and vulgar ''testa'' (originally "pot") in Italian, French and Catalan. In Romanian ''cap'' means 'head' in the anatomical sense, but ''țeastă'' means skull or [[carapace]],&lt;ref&gt;From the online [[Dicționarul explicativ al limbii române|Romanian Explanatory Dictionary]] [http://dexonline.ro/search.php?lexemId=56807 ]&lt;/ref&gt; while ''țest'' means "pot" or "[[Lid (container)|lid]]".&lt;ref&gt;From the online [[Dicționarul explicativ al limbii române|Romanian Explanatory Dictionary]] [http://dexonline.ro/search.php?lexemId=57415 ]&lt;/ref&gt; Some southern Italian dialects preserve ''capo'' as the normal word for "head". Spanish and Portuguese have ''cabeza''/''cabeça'', derived from *''capetia'', a modified form of ''caput'', but in Portuguese ''testa'' is the word for "forehead".

Frequently, words borrowed directly from literary Latin at some later date, rather than evolved within Vulgar Latin, are found side by side with the evolved form.  The (lack of) expected phonological developments is a clue that one word has been borrowed.  For example, Vulgar Latin ''fungus'', "fungus, mushroom", which became Italian ''fungo'', Catalan ''fong'', and Portuguese ''fungo'', became ''hongo'' in Spanish, showing the ''f'' &gt; ''h'' shift that was common in early Spanish (cf. ''fīlius'' &gt; Spanish ''hijo'', "son", ''facere'' &gt; Spanish ''hacer'', "to do").  But Spanish also had ''fungo'', which by its lack of the expected sound shifts of /f/ and /u/ shows that it was borrowed directly from Latin.&lt;ref name="Harrington" /&gt;

Vulgar Latin contained a large number of words of foreign origin not present in literary texts. Many works on medicine were written and distributed in Greek, and words were often borrowed from these sources.  For example, ''gamba'' ( 'knee joint' ), originally a veterinary term only, replaced the classical Latin word for leg (''crus'') in most Romance languages. (cf. Fr. jambe, It. gamba). Cooking terms were also often borrowed from Greek sources; a [[calque]] based on a Greek term was ''ficatum (iecur)'' (goose's liver fattened with figs, see [[foie gras]] for more information), with the participle ''ficatum'' becoming the common word for liver in Vulgar Latin (cf. Sp. ''hígado'', Fr. ''foie'', It. ''fegato'', Pt ''fígado'', Romanian ''ficat''). Important religious terms were also drawn from religious texts written in Greek, such as ''episcopus'' (bishop), ''presbyter'' (priest), ''martyr'' etc. Words borrowed from Gaulish include ''caballus'' (horse) and ''carrus'' (chariot).

[[Image:Apollo 11 map notations.jpg|thumb|right|Notes on a map written with a felt-tip pen by [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]] while in orbit around the Moon]]
Several instruments have been used to write in [[outer space]], including different types of [[pencil]]s and [[pen]]s. Some of them have been unmodified versions of conventional writing instruments; others have been invented specifically to counter the problems with writing in space conditions.

A common [[urban legend]] states that, faced with the fact that ball-point pens would not write in zero-gravity, NASA spent a large amount of money to develop a pen that would write in the conditions experienced during spaceflight (the result purportedly being the Fisher Space Pen), while the Soviet Union took the simpler and cheaper route of just using pencils. The Fisher Space Pen was developed independently by a private organization in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is it true that NASA spent thousands of dollars developing a space pen, whereas the Russians just took a pencil?|url=http://www.physics.org/facts/apollo-nasa-pen.asp|publisher=physics.org|accessdate=2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Fisher Space Pen|url=https://history.nasa.gov/spacepen.html|publisher=Steve Garber, NASA History Web Curator|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Cosmonaut Alexei Leonov testing out his first Fisher Space Pen back in 1968 | url=http://www.pinterest.com/pin/71987294015259014/ | accessdate=October 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission requirements==
Space versus ground recordkeeping presents several serious issues:

===Contamination control===
{{main|Contamination control}}
{{also|Apollo 1}}
As with submarines before them, space capsules are closed environments, subject to strict contamination requirements. Incoming material is screened for mission threats.  Any shedding, including wood, graphite, and ink vapors and droplets, may become a risk.  In the case of a manned capsule, the much smaller recirculating volume, combined with [[microgravity]] and an even greater difficulty of resupply, make these requirements even more critical.

Release of wood shavings, graphite dust, broken graphite tips, and ink compounds are a dangerous flight hazard.  Lack of gravity makes objects drift, even with air filtration.  Any conductive material is a threat to electronics, including the electromechanical switches in use during early manned space programs.  Nonconductive particles may also hamper switch contacts, such as normally-open and rotary mechanisms.  Drifting particles are a threat to the eyes (and to a lesser extent an inhalation threat), which may risk execution of a critical procedure.  Personnel may don protective gear, but both ground and flight crews are more comfortable and more productive "[[Shirt-sleeve environment|in shirtsleeves]]".  Paul C. Fisher of Fisher Pen Company recounts that pencils were 'too dangerous to use in space'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Space Pen History | url = http://www.allwrite.com/Space-Pen-History.html | accessdate=October 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even before the [[Apollo 1|Apollo 1 fire]], the [[Apollo Command/Service Module#Command Module (CM)|CM crew cabin]] was reviewed for hazardous materials such as paper, velcro, and even low-temperature plastics.  A directive was issued but poorly enforced.  When combined with high oxygen [[Partial pressure|content]], the Apollo 1 cabin burned within seconds, killing all three crew members.

Cosmonaut [[Anatoly Solovyev]] flew with Space Pens starting in the '80s and states "pencil lead breaks...and is not good in space capsule; very dangerous to have metal lead particles in zero gravity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Just the FAQ Ma'am | url = http://www.thewritersedge.com/faq.cfm | accessdate = October 4, 2013 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131004224752/http://www.thewritersedge.com/faq.cfm | archivedate = October 4, 2013 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mission assurance and quality records===
{{main|Mission assurance}}
{{also|Life-critical system|System engineering}}
Strict documentation requirements accompany anything as complex as a large-scale aerospace demonstration, let alone a manned spaceflight.  [[Quality assurance records]] document individual parts, and instances of procedures, for deviances.  Low production and flight rates generally result in high variance; most spacecraft designs (to say nothing of individual spacecraft) fly so infrequently that they are considered [[experimental aircraft]].  When combined with the stringent [[Mass ratio|weight drivers]] of orbital and deep-space flight, the quality-control demands are high.  [[Change control]] records track the evolution of hardware and procedures from their ground testing, [[Flight test|initial flights]], through [[Shakedown (testing)|necessary corrections]] and midlife revision and upgrades, and on to [[Organizational memory|retention of engineering knowledge]] for later programs, and any [[Forensic science|incident investigations]].

When the flight also has scientific or engineering science objectives, [[Dirty data|low-quality data]] may affect mission success directly.

Faced with these requirements, pencils or other non-permanent recordkeeping methods are unsatisfactory.  The act of taking [[Transparency (behavior)|permanent, high-integrity documentation]] itself deters [[kludge]]s, [[workaround]]s, and "[[go fever]]".  The Apollo 1 investigation uncovered procedural and workmanship deficiencies in multiple areas, up to procedures on the pad.

===Pressure and temperature===

At sea level, temperature is moderated by the thick atmosphere.  As air pressure falls, temperatures can swing more dramatically.  Many early manned missions operated at below standard pressure, to decrease the stresses (and thus, mass) of their [[Pressure vessel|capsules]].  Many did not have separate airlocks, instead exposing the entire cabin to hard vacuum at times.  Low pressures also exacerbate contamination issues, as substances acceptable at standard conditions may begin outgassing at lower pressures or higher temperatures.  While the [[Soyuz spacecraft]] had a {{convert|14.7|psi|abbr=on}} design pressure, and could use its [[orbital module]] as an airlock, the orbital module would be deleted for planned [[Zond program|lunar missions]].  In any case, a pen which was insensitive to pressure and temperature would eliminate the issue (including accidental depressurizations), provide a [[Factor of safety|margin]], and allow the ability to record during extravehicular activities.

==Pre-existing writing instruments==
The wood [[pencil]] has been used for writing by [[NASA]] and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] space programs from the start. It is simple with no moving parts, except for the [[pencil sharpener|sharpener]]. However, wood, graphite, and rubber (in the [[eraser]]) are all [[combustible]] and create dust. Graphite, in particular, both burns and produces dust that conducts [[electricity]].

The [[mechanical pencil]] has been used by NASA starting in the 1960s [[Gemini program]]. It can be made to be as wide as the width of astronauts' gloves, yet maintain its light weight. There are no wooden components which might catch fire and create dust. However, the pencil lead still creates graphite dust that conducts electricity.

[[Grease pencil]]s on plastic slates were used by the Soviet space program as an early substitute for wood pencils. It is simple with no moving parts. The paper shroud is peeled back when needed. The disadvantage is that the paper wrapper has to be disposed of. Writing done with the grease pencil is also [[Data integrity|not as durable]] as ink on paper.

[[Ballpoint pen]]s have been used by Soviet and then Russian space programs as a substitute for grease pencils as well as NASA and ESA. The pens are cheap, use paper (which is easily available), and writing done using pen is more permanent than that done with graphite pencils and grease pencils, which makes the ball point pen more suitable for log books and scientific note books. However, the ink is indelible, and depending on composition is subject to [[outgassing]] and [[Viscosity|temperature variations]].

[[Marker pen|Felt-tip pens]] were used by NASA astronauts in the [[Apollo missions]].  However, wick-based instruments are designed around low viscosity, and thus [[operating temperature]] and pressure.

==Writing instruments specifically intended for space writing==
The Fisher Space Pen is a gas-charged ball point pen that is rugged and works in a wider variety of conditions, such as [[zero gravity]], [[vacuum]] and extreme temperatures. Its [[Thixotropy|thixotropic]] ink and vent-free cartridge release no significant vapor at common temperatures and low pressures. The ink is forced out by compressed nitrogen at a pressure of nearly 35 psi (240 kPa), and it functions at altitudes up to 12,500 feet (3800 m) and at temperatures from −30 to 250 °F (−35 to 120 °C). However, it is more expensive than the aforementioned alternatives. It has been used by both NASA and Soviet/Russian astronauts on [[Apollo program|Apollo]], [[Space Shuttle|Shuttle]], [[Mir]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = ...

'''Yuantang''' is [[language game]] spoken by [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]] speakers at [[Yuantang]] ({{Zh|c=苑塘}}), a village in [[Northern and southern China|southern China]]. It is also known as the ''snake language''{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}.

==Rules==
Example : 食饭 → 手习花散 [sit fan] → [siu jit fa san]; eat (rice) → ''hand + learn + flower + separation''.

Clearly, the words 食 and 饭 are each split into two sounds, the initial and the rime, thus 食 [sit] is made up of the initial of 手 [s] and the rime of 习 [it], and similarly, 饭 [fan] is [f] from 花 and [an] from 散. This is similar to the traditional Chinese practice of representing sounds by two characters known as [[fanqie]].
&lt;br&gt;
This practice also resembles [[Jin Chinese|Jin]], another Sinitic language, in its process of splitting a monosyllabic word into two syllables. A similar process is also found in [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]].

==History==
There is no solid evidence for the original of Yuantang. But it is believed to be an invention of a local intellectual in [[Qing dynasty]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}
