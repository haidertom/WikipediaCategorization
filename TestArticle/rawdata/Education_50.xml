'''21st century skills''' comprise [[higher-order thinking|skills]], [[aptitude|abilities]], and learning [[disposition|dispositions]] that have been identified as being required for [[achieved status|success]] in 21st century society and workplaces by educators, business leaders, [[faculty (academic staff)|academics]], and [[government agency|governmental agencies]].  This is part of a growing international movement focusing on the skills required for students to master in preparation for success in a rapidly changing, [[information society|digital society]].  Many of these skills are also associated with [[Deeper Learning|deeper learning]], which is based on mastering skills such as [[analytic reasoning]], complex [[problem solving]], and [[teamwork]].  These skills differ from traditional academic skills in that they are not primarily content knowledge-based.&lt;ref name="Dede"&gt;[http://sttechnology.pbworks.com/f/Dede_(2010)_Comparing%20Frameworks%20for%2021st%20Century%20Skills.pdf Chris Dede, Comparing Frameworks for 21st Century Skills, Harvard Graduate School of Education, 2009].

During the latter decades of the 20th century and into the 21st century, [[society]] has undergone an accelerating pace of change in [[economy]] and [[technology]].  Its effects on the [[workplace]], and thus on the demands on the educational system preparing students for the [[workforce]], have been significant in several ways.  Beginning in the 1980s, government, educators, and major employers issued a series of reports identifying key skills and implementation strategies to steer students and workers towards meeting the demands of the changing workplace and society.

The current workforce is significantly more likely to change career fields or jobs.  Those in the [[Baby boomers|Baby Boom]] generation entered the workforce with a goal of stability; subsequent generations are more concerned with finding [[eudaimonia|happiness]] and fulfillment in their work lives.  Young workers in North America are now likely to change jobs at a much higher rate than previously, as much as once every 4.4 years on average.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeannemeister/2012/08/14/job-hopping-is-the-new-normal-for-millennials-three-ways-to-prevent-a-human-resource-nightmare/#1cb0e4da5508 ''Job-hopping is the new normal for millennials'', Forbes Magazine, August 14, 2012].

Many of these skills are also identified as key qualities of [[progressive education]], a pedagogical movement that began in the late nineteenth century and continues in various forms to the present.

==Background==
Since the early 1980s, a variety of governmental, academic, non-profit, and corporate entities have conducted considerable research to identify key personal and academic skills and competencies they determined were needed for the current and next generation.  The identification and implementation of 21st century skills into education and workplaces began in the United States but has spread to Canada,&lt;ref&gt;[https://c21parentguide.wordpress.com C21 - A Parent's Guide to 21st century learning].

In 1981, the US Secretary of Education created the [[National Commission on Excellence in Education]] to examine the quality of education in the United States."&lt;ref name="Nation1"&gt;[http://www2.ed.gov/pubs/NatAtRisk/intro.html Nation at Risk, introduction] Retrieved 2016-03-09&lt;/ref&gt;  The commission issued its report ''[[A Nation at Risk|A Nation at Risk: The Imperative for Educational Reform]]'' in 1983.

Until the dawn of the 21st century, education systems across the world focussed on preparing their students to accumulate content and knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Care|first1=Esther|title=How Education Systems Approach Breadth of Skills|url=https://www.brookings.edu/research/how-education-systems-approach-breadth-of-skills/.|website=Brookings|publisher=Brookings}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, schools focussed on providing literacy and numeracy skills to their students, as these skills were perceived as necessary to gain content and knowledge. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Care|first1=Esther|title=How Education Systems Approach Breadth of Skills|url=https://www.brookings.edu/research/how-education-systems-approach-breadth-of-skills/.|website=Brookings|publisher=Brookings}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent developments in technology and telecommunication have made information and knowledge ubiquitous and easily accessible in the 21st century. Therefore, while skills such as literacy and numeracy are still relevant and necessary, they are no longer sufficient. In order to respond to technological, demographic and socio-economic changes, education systems began to make the shift toward providing their students with a range of skills that relied not only on cognition but also on the interdependencies of cognitive, social, and emotional characteristics. &lt;ref&gt;Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee, The Second Machine Age: Work, Progress, and Prosperity in a Time of Brilliant Technologies (W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;  

Notable efforts were conducted by the US Secretary of Labor's Commission on Achieving Necessary Skills (SCANS), a national coalition called the Partnership for 21st Century Skills (P21), the international [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]], the American Association of College and Universities, researchers at [[MIT]] and other institutions of higher learning, and private organizations.

Additional research has found that the top skills demanded by U.S. [[Fortune 500]] companies by the year 2000 had shifted from traditional reading, writing and arithmetic to teamwork, problem solving, and interpersonal skills.&lt;ref name="Cassel &amp; Kolstad"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cassel|first1=R.N.|last2=Kolstad|first2=R.|title=The critical job-skills requirements for the 21st century: Living and working with people|journal=Journal of Instructional Psychology|date=1998|volume=25|issue=3|pages=176–180}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2006 [[Conference Board]] survey of some 400 employers revealed that the most important skills for new workforce entrants included oral and written communications and critical thinking/problem solving, ahead of basic knowledge and skills, such as the reading comprehension and mathematics.  While the [[The three Rs|‘three Rs’]] were still considered foundational to new workforce entrants’ abilities, employers emphasized that applied skills like collaboration/teamwork and critical thinking were ‘very important’ to success at work."&lt;ref name="Conference Board"&gt;{{cite book|title=Are They Ready to Work?

A 2006 report from MIT researchers countered the suggestion that students acquire critical skills and competencies independently by interacting with popular culture, noting three continuing trends that suggest the need for policy and pedagogical interventions:"&lt;ref name="Jenkins"&gt;[http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED536086.pdf Jenkins].

*The Ethics Challenge — The breakdown of traditional forms of professional training and socialization that might prepare young people for their increasingly public roles as media makers and community participants."

According to labor economists at [[MIT]] and [[Harvard University|Harvard’s Graduate School of Education]], the economic changes brought about over the past four decades by emerging technology and [[globalization]], employers’ demands for people with competencies like complex thinking and communications skills has increased greatly.&lt;ref name="Murnane &amp; Levy"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murnane|first1=Richard J.|last2=Levy|first2=Frank|title=Teaching the New Basic Skills: Principles for Educating Children to Thrive in a Changing Economy|date=1996|publisher=Free Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They argue that the success of the U.S. economy will rely on the nation’s ability to give students the "foundational skills in problem-solving and communications that computers don’t have."&lt;ref name="Levy &amp; Murnane"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Levy|first1=Frank|last2=Murnane|first2=Richard|title=Dancing with Robots: Human Skills for Computerized Work|publisher=Third Way|url=http://content.thirdway.org/publications/714/Dancing-With-Robots.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the [[Common Core State Standards Initiative]], an effort sponsored by the [[National Governors Association]] (NGA) and the [[Council of Chief State School Officers]] (CCSSO),   issued the [[Common Core Standards]], calling for the integration of 21st century skills into K-12 curricula across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Common Core State Standards Initiative |url=http://www.corestandards.org/resources/frequently-asked-questions |accessdate=December 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The skills==
The skills and competencies that are generally considered "21st Century skills" are varied but share some common themes.  They are based on the premise that effective learning, or [[Deeper Learning|deeper learning]], a set of student educational outcomes including acquisition of robust core academic content, higher-order thinking skills, and learning dispositions.  This [[pedagogy]] involves creating, working with others, analyzing, and presenting and sharing both the learning experience and the learned knowledge or wisdom, including to peers and mentors as well as teachers.  This contrasts with more traditional learning methodology that involves learning by rote and regurgitating info/knowledge back to the teacher for a grade. The skills are geared towards students and workers to foster engagement; seeking, forging, and facilitating connections to knowledge, ideas, peers, instructors, and wider audiences; creating/producing; and presenting/publishing.  The classification or grouping has been undertaken to encourage and promote pedagogies that facilitate deeper learning through both traditional instruction as well as [[active learning]], [[project-based learning]], [[problem based learning]], and others.  A 2012 survey conducted by the [[American Management Association]] (AMA) identified three top skills necessary for their employees: [[critical thinking]], communication and collaboration.&lt;ref name="Critical Skills Survey"&gt;{{cite book|title=Critical Skills Survey|date=2012|publisher=American Management Association|location=New York|url=http://playbook.amanet.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/2012-Critical-Skills-Survey-pdf.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Below are some of the more readily identifiable lists of 21st century skills.

===SCANS===
Following the release of ''A Nation at Risk'', the U.S. [[Secretary of Labor]] appointed the '''Secretary's Commission on Achieving Necessary Skills (SCANS)''' to determine the skills needed for young people to succeed in the workplace to foster a high-performance economy.  SCANS focused on what they called "learning a living" system. In 1991, they issued their initial report, ''What Work Requires of Schools''.  The report concluded that a high-performance workplace requires workers who have key fundamental skills:  basic skills and knowledge, thinking skills to apply that knowledge, personal skills to manage and perform; and five key workplace competencies.&lt;ref name="SCANS"&gt;[http://www.academicinnovations.com/report.html SCANS report 1991].  Retrieved 2016-03-08&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fundamental Skills'''
*Basic Skills:  ''reads, writes, performs arithmetic and mathematical operations, listens and speaks.''
*Thinking Skills:  ''thinks creatively, makes decisions, solves problems, visualizes, knows how to learn, and reasons''
*Personal Qualities:  ''displays responsibility, self-esteem, sociability, self-management, and integrity and honesty''

'''Workplace Competencies'''
*Resources:  ''identifies, organizes, plans, and allocates resources''
*Interpersonal:  ''works with others (participates as member of a team, teaches others new skills, serves clients/customers, exercises leadership, negotiates, works with diversity'')
*Information:  ''acquires and uses information (acquires and evaluates, organizes and maintains, and interprets and communicates information; uses computers to process information'')
*Systems:  ''understands complex inter-relationships (understands systems, monitors and corrects performance, improves or designs systems)''
*Technology:  ''works with a variety of technologies (selects technology, applies technology to task, maintains and troubleshoots equipment)''

===Partnership for 21st Century Skills (P21)===
In 2002 the Partnership for 21st Century Skills (now the Partnership for 21st Century Learning, or '''P21''') was founded as a [[non-profit]] organization by a coalition that included members of the national business community, education leaders, and policymakers:  the [[National Education Association]] (NEA), [[United States Department of Education]], [[AOL Time-Warner|AOL Time Warner Foundation]], [[Apple Computer, Inc.]], [[Cable in the Classroom]], [[Cisco Systems, Inc.]], [[Dell Computer Corporation]], [[Microsoft Corporation]], [[SAP SE|SAP]], Ken Kay (President and Co-Founder), and Dins Golder-Dardis.&lt;ref name="P21history"&gt;[http://www.p21.org/about-us/our-history P21 Our History].

{{main article|Participatory culture}}
Researchers at MIT, led by [[Henry Jenkins]], Director of the Comparative Media Studies Program, in 2006 issued a white paper ("Confronting the Challenges of a Participatory Culture:  Media Education for the 21st Century"), that examined digital media and learning.&lt;ref name="Jenkins"/&gt;  To address this [[Digital Divide]], they recommended an effort be made to develop the cultural competencies and social skills required to participate fully in modern society instead of merely advocating for installing computers in each classroom.&lt;ref name="Jenkins3"&gt;[http://www.newmedialiteracies.org/ New Media Literacies webpage].  Retrieved 2016-03-08&lt;/ref&gt; What they term [[participatory culture]] shifts this literacy from the individual level to a broader connection and involvement, with the premise that networking and collaboration develop social skills that are vital to new literacies.  These in turn build on traditional foundation skills and knowledge taught in school:  traditional literacy, research, technical, and critical analysis skills.

Participatory culture is defined by this study as having: low barriers to artistic expression and civic engagement, strong support for creating and sharing one’s creations, informal mentorship, belief that members' own contributions matter, and social connection (caring what other people think about their creations).&lt;ref name="Jenkins"/&gt;
Forms of participatory culture include:&lt;ref name="Jenkins"/&gt;
*Affiliations — ''memberships, formal and informal, in online communities centered around various forms of media, such as message boards, metagaming, game clans, and other social media).''
*Expressions — ''producing new creative forms, such as digital sampling, [[Skin (computing)|skinning]] and [[modding]], fan videomaking, fan fiction writing, [[zines]], [[mash-ups]].''
*Collaborative Problem-solving — ''working together in teams, formal and informal, to complete tasks and develop new knowledge (such as through Wikipedia, alternative reality gaming, spoiling).''
*Circulations — ''shaping the flow of media (such as [[podcasting]], [[blogging]])''.

The skills identified were:&lt;ref name="Dede"/&gt;
*Play 
*Simulation 
*Appropriation
*Multitasking
*Distributed Cognition 
*Collective Intelligence
*Judgment
*Transmedia Navigation

===EnGauge 21st century skills===
In 2003 the North Central Regional Educational Laboratory and the Metiri Group issued a report entitled "enGauge® 21st Century Skills: Literacy in the Digital Age" based on two years of research.  The report called for policymakers and educators to define 21st century skills, highlight the relationship of those skills to conventional academic standards, and recognize the need for multiple assessments to measure and evaluate these skills within the context of academic standards and the current technological and global society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pict.sdsu.edu/engauge21st.pdf enGauge 21st Century Skills].  Retrieved 2016-03-08&lt;/ref&gt;  To provide a common understanding of, and language for discussing, the needs of students, citizens, and workers in a modern digital society, the report identified four "skill clusters":
*Digital-Age Literacy
*Inventive Thinking
*Effective Communication
*High Productivity

===OECD competencies===
In 1997, member countries of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] launched the [[Programme for International Student Assessment]] (PISA) to monitor "the extent to which students near the end of compulsory schooling have acquired the knowledge and skills essential for full participation in society".&lt;ref name="OECD"&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/pisa/35070367.pdf ''The Definition and Selection of Key Competencies'', OECD, 2005].  Retrieved 2016-03-08&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2005 they identified three "Competency Categories:" 
*Using Tools Interactively
*Interacting in Heterogeneous Groups
*Acting Autonomously

===American Association of College and Universities===
The AAC&amp;U conducted several studies and surveys of their members.  In 2007 they recommended that graduates of higher education attain four skills - '''The Essential Learning Outcomes:'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://209.29.151.145/about/membership/surveytalkingpoints ''Talking Points: AAC&amp;U 2009 Member Survey Findings''] .  Retrieved 2016-03-10&lt;/ref&gt;
*Knowledge of Human Cultures and the Physical and Natural World
*Intellectual and Practical Skills
*Personal and Social Responsibility
*Integrative Learning

They found that skills most widely addressed in college and university goals are:&lt;ref&gt;[http://209.29.151.145/sites/default/files/files/LEAP/2015_Survey_Report2_GEtrends.pdf AAC&amp;U - ''Recent Trends in General Education Design, Learning Outcomes, and Teaching Approaches'', 2015].  Retrieved 2016-03-10&lt;/ref&gt;
*writing
*critical thinking
*quantitative reasoning
*oral communication
*intercultural skills
*information literacy
*ethical reasoning

A 2015 survey of AAC&amp;U member institutions added the following goals:
*analytic reasoning
*research skills and projects 
*integration of learning across disciplines 
*application of learning beyond the classroom 
*civic engagement and competence

===ISTE / NETS performance standards===
The '''ISTE Educational Technology Standards''' (formerly '''[[National Educational Technology Standards]] (NETS)''') are a set of standards published by the [[International Society for Technology in Education]] (ISTE) to leverage the use of technology in [[K-12 education]].&lt;ref&gt;NETS Project(2007). National Educational Technology Standards for Students. ISTE. {{ISBN|978-1-56484-237-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ISTE"&gt;[http://www.iste.org/standards/iste-standards/standards-for-students ISTE Standards for Students].  Retrieved 2016-03-09&lt;/ref&gt;  These are sometimes intermixed with information and communication technologies (ICT) skills.  In 2007 NETS issued a series of six performance indicators (only the first four are on their website as of 2016):

*Creativity and Innovation
*Communication and Collaboration
*Research and Information Fluency
*Critical Thinking, Problem Solving, and Decision Making
*Digital Citizenship
*Technology Operations and Concepts

===ICT Literacy Panel digital literacy standards (2007)===
In 2007 the [[Educational Testing Service]] (ETS) ICT Literacy Panel released its digital literacy standards:&lt;ref name="ETS"&gt;[https://www.ets.org/Media/Tests/Information_and_Communication_Technology_Literacy/ictreport.pdf ''Digital Transformation - A Framework for ICT Literacy.'' International ICT Literacy Panel. 2007].  Retrieved 2016-03-08&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[Information and Communication Technologies|Information and Communication Technologies (ICT)]] proficiencies:
*Cognitive proficiency
*Technical proficiency
*ICT proficiency

A person possessing these skills would be expected to perform these tasks for a particular set of information:  access, manage, integrate, evaluate, create/publish/present.  The emphasis is on proficiency with digital tools.&lt;ref name="ETS"/&gt;

===Dede learning styles and categories===
In 2005, Chris Dede of the Harvard Graduate School of Education developed a framework based on new digital literacies entitled&lt;br /&gt;
'''Neomillennial Learning Styles''':&lt;ref name="Dede"/&gt;
*Fluency in multiple media
*Active learning based on collectively seeking, sieving, and synthesizing experiences.
*Expression through non-linear, associational webs of representations.
*Co-design by teachers and students of personalized learning experiences.

'''Dede category system'''&lt;br /&gt;
With the exponential expansion of personal access to Internet resources, including social media, information and content on the Internet has evolved from being created by website providers to individuals and communities of contributors.  The 21st century Internet centered on material created by a small number of people, [[Web 2.0]] tools (e.g. Wikipedia) foster online communication, collaboration, and creation of content by large numbers of people (individually or in groups) in online communities.&lt;ref name="Dede"/&gt;

In 2009, Dede created a category system for Web 2.0 tools:&lt;ref name="Dede"/&gt; 
*Sharing (communal bookmarking, photo/video sharing, social networking, writers’ workshops/fanfiction)
*Thinking (blogs, podcasts, online discussion fora)
*Co-Creating (wikis/collaborative file creation, mashups/collective media creation, collaborative social change communities)

===World Economic Forum===

In 2015, the World Economic Forum published a report titled ‘New Vision for Education: Unlocking the Potential of Technology’ &lt;ref&gt;http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEFUSA_NewVisionforEducation_Report2015.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; that focused on the pressing issue of the 21st-century skills gap and ways to address it through technology. In the report, they defined a set of 16 crucial proficiencies for education in the 21st century. Those skills include six “foundational literacies”, four “competencies” and six “character qualities” listed below.

'''Foundation Literacies'''
*Literacy and numeracy
*Scientific literacy
*ICT literacy
*Financial literacy
*Cultural literacy
*Civic literacy

'''Competencies'''

*Critical thinking/problem solving
*Communication
*Collaboration

'''Character Qualities'''
*Creativity 
*Initiative 
*Persistence/grit
*Adaptability
*Curiosity
*Leadership
*Social and cultural awareness

===National Research Council===

In a paper titled ‘Education for Life and Work: Developing Transferable Knowledge and Skills in the 21st Century’ &lt;ref&gt;http://www.leg.state.vt.us/WorkGroups/EdOp/Education%20for%20Life%20and%20Work-%20National%20Academy%20of%20Sciences.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; produced by the National Research Council of National Academies, the National Research defines 21st century skills, describes how the skills relate to each other and summaries the evidence regarding 21st century skills. 

As a first step toward describing “21st century skills,” the National Research Council identified three domains of competence: cognitive, interpersonal, and intrapersonal while recognizing that the three domains while different, are intertwined in human development and learning. These three domains represent distinct facets of human thinking and build on previous efforts to identify and organize dimensions of human behaviour. The committee produced the following cluster of 21st century skills in the above mentioned 3 domains. 

'''Cognitive Competencies'''

*Cognitive processes and strategies: Critical thinking, problem solving, analysis, reasoning and argumentation, interpretation, decision-making, adaptive learning
*Knowledge: Information literacy, ICT literacy, oral and written communication, and active listening
*Creativity: Creativity and innovation

'''Intrapersonal Competencies'''

*Intellectual openness: Flexibility, adaptability, artistic and cultural appreciation, personal and social responsibility, appreciation for diversity, adaptability, continuous learning, intellectual interest and curiosity
*Work ethic/conscientiousness: Initiative, self-direction, responsibility, perseverance, grit, career orientation, ethics, integrity, citizenship
*Positive core self-evaluation: Self monitoring, self evaluation, self reinforcement, physical and psychological health

'''Interpersonal Competencies'''

*Teamwork and collaboration: Communication, collaboration, cooperation, teamwork, coordination, interpersonal skills
*Leadership: Responsibility, assertive communication, self presentation, social influence with others

==Implementation==
Multiple agencies and organizations have issued guides and recommendation for implementation of 21st century skills in a variety of [[learning environment]]s and [[learning space]]s.  These include five separate educational areas: standards, assessment, professional development, curriculum &amp; instruction, and learning environments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.p21.org/storage/documents/p21-stateimp_curriculuminstruction.pdf P21 implementation guide].  Retrieved 2016-03-09&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hanoverresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Best-Practices-in-Implementing-21st-Century-Skills-Initiatives-Membership.pdf Hanover Research, Best Practices in Implementing 21st Century Skills Initiatives].  Retrieved 2016-03-11&lt;/ref&gt;

The designs of learning environments and curricula have been impacted by the initiatives and efforts to implement and support 21st century skills with a move away from the [[Factory model school|factory model school model]] and into a variety of different [[school organizational models|organizational models]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nea.org/home/46989.htm NEA 21st-Century Learner, summer 2011].

Retrieved 2016-03-11&lt;/ref&gt;  Hands-on learning project-based learning have resulted in the development of programs and spaces such as [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] and [[makerspaces]].  Collaborative learning environments have fostered flexibility in furniture and classroom layout as well as differentiated spaces, such as small seminar rooms near classrooms.  Literacy with, and access to, digital technology has impacted the design of furniture and fixed components as students and teachers use tablets, [[interactive whiteboard]]s and interactive projectors.  Classroom sizes have grown to accommodate a variety of furniture arrangements and grouping, many of which are less space-efficient than traditional configurations of desks in rows.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bobpearlman.org/Articles/ET%20Bob%20Pearlman%20article.pdf ''Making 21st Century Schools - Creating Learner-Centered Schoolplaces/Workplaces for a New Culture of Students at Work'', Bob Pearlman, EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY/September–October 2009].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2624">In [[academia]], '''specialization''' ([[American and British English spelling differences#-ise.2C_-ize_.28-isation.2C_-ization.29|or]] '''specialisation''') may be a course of study or [[Academic major|major]] at an academic institution or may refer to the field that a [[specialist (disambiguation)|specialist]] practices in. In the case of an educator, academic specialization pertains to the subject that he specializes in and teaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=To Want to Learn: Insights and Provocations for Engaged Learning, 2nd ed.|last=Kytle|first=Jackson|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2012|isbn=9780230338203|location=New York|pages=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered a precondition of objective truth and works by restricting the mind's propensity for [[eclecticism]] through methodological rigor and studious effort.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Historics: Why History Dominates Contemporary Society|last=Davies|first=Martin|publisher=Routledge|year=2006|isbn=0415261651|location=New York|pages=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also employed as an information-management strategy, which operates by fragmenting an issue into different aspective fields or areas of expertise to obtain truth.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  

== Development ==
As the volume of knowledge accumulated by humanity became too great, increasing specialization in academia appeared in response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Yale Forest School News, Volumes 77-78|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7AP0AAAAMAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22specialization%22|year=1990|publisher=Yale Forestry Alumni Assn.|page= 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also cases when this concept emerged out of state policy-making to pursue goals such as [[Competition|national competitiveness]]. For instance, there is the case of [[United Kingdom|Britain]] who began coordinating academic specialization - through the founding of the [[Imperial College London|Imperial College]] - to catch up to the [[United States]] and [[Germany]], particularly in the fields of scientific and technical education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=History of Universities: Volume XVIII/1 2003, Volume 18|last=Feingold|first=Mordechai|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2003|isbn=0199262020|location=Oxford|pages=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Action Bioscience''' is a non-commercial, educational [[web site]] sponsored by the [[American Institute of Biological Sciences]] (AIBS) . It was created to promote [[Biology|bioscience]] [[scientific literacy|literacy]] and bring attention to seven bioscience issues of critical current importance: 1) [[Biodiversity]], 2) [[Natural environment|Environment]], 3) [[Genomics]], 4) [[Biotechnology]], 5) [[Evolution]], 6) New Frontiers, and 7) Science [[Education]]

The organization seeks to:

* motivate the public to play an active role in bioscience education
* show how developments in bioscience research can affect everyone
* promote an understanding of biogeography and the biodiversity of life
* engage the public to reflect on the relationship between human activity and the natural course of evolution
* promote global ecological awareness
* advance formal and informal bioscience education
* encourage students to pursue studies in the biosciences

To meet these goals, the web site provides articles by scientists, science educators, and science students on issues related to seven bioscience challenges: environment, biodiversity, genomics, biotechnology, evolution, new frontiers in science, and bioscience education. In addition, the web site provides educators with original lessons and resources to enhance bioscience teaching. Up-to-date external links are provided at the bottom of each article to help the reader "learn more" about or "get involved" in the issue. Selected articles are translated into Spanish.

It won an award as one of the best sci-tech web sites by [[Scientific American]].&lt;ref&gt;"2003 Sci/Tech Web Awards: BIOLOGY", Scientific American, http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=000A436B-4DC2-1ECA-8E1C809EC588EF21, accessed December 13, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Adobe Captivate''' is an authoring tool that is used for creating elearning content such as software demonstrations, software simulations, branched scenarios, and randomized quizzes in Small Web Formats ([[SWF|.swf]]) and HTML5 formats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Adobe Captivate Help {{!}} Publish projects as SWF files|url = https://helpx.adobe.com/captivate/using/publish-projects-swf-files.html|website = helpx.adobe.com|accessdate = 2015-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Adobe Captivate Help {{!}} Publish projects as HTML5 files|url = https://helpx.adobe.com/captivate/using/publish-projects-html5-files.html|website = helpx.adobe.com|accessdate = 2015-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It can also convert Adobe Captivate-generated file formats (.swf) to digital MP4 ([[.mp4]]) formats which can be played with media players or uploaded to video hosting websites. For software simulations, Captivate can use left or right mouse clicks, key presses and rollover images.

It can also be used to create [[screencast]]s, and to convert [[Microsoft PowerPoint]] presentations to [[.swf]] and HTML5 formats.

==History==
While the product started out as a pure screen recording utility known as Flashcam (Nexus Concepts 2002), it evolved into an [[E-learning]] [[Authoring systems|authoring tool]] after [[San Diego]]-based eHelp Corporation acquired Flashcam and released it as RoboDemo.  Eventually, software firm [[Macromedia]] acquired eHelp to gain RoboDemo.  Shortly before Adobe Systems acquired Macromedia, they changed the name of the product to Captivate.

'''Adventures of the Mind''' is an achievement-focused mentoring camp for talented high school students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/06/24/137397953/top-students-converge-at-mind-summit-in-montana|title=Top Students Converge at Mind Summit in Montana|website=NPR.org|access-date=2016-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Educators from across the nation nominate students whom they believe, with guidance and nurture, can maximize their potential and make important contributions to society. Honored guests share their life stories that can serve as a road map to the students on their own personal paths to success.

==History==
Founded in 2003, the ''Adventures of the Mind'' achievement mentoring camp brings together, on a college campus, high potential teens from across the country with accomplished mentors from a variety of fields: artists, astronauts, athletes, entrepreneurs, inventors, journalists, [[Nobel laureates]], novelists, poets, poker players, programmers, public servants, [[Pulitzer prize]] winners, scholars, and more. Adventures of the Mind provides the students — who are the great thinker and achievers of tomorrow — with an opportunity to interact with some of the great thinkers and achievers of today. The camp runs for 7 days and is developed by student achievement and advocacy services. [[Murray Gell-Mann]] who was awarded the 1969 Nobel Prize in Physics and a Mentor at the 2011 summit, is quoted as saying:

==Student selection process==
Student attendees are selected through a highly personalized and rigorous search that goes beyond traditional measures of achievement — grades and test scores — by asking teachers to personally nominate an exceptional teen. Attendees are chosen regardless of learning disabilities, socioeconomic factors, or other obstacles that may obscure real potential. Additionally, participants are chosen from runners-up in national competitions ranging from the [[Presidential Scholars Program]] to the [[Intel Science Talent Search]] to the [[National Poetry Slam]]. ''Adventures of the Mind'' targets high potential students who may not yet garner the same level of recognition as their peers, but would benefit just as much from the experience the camp provides.

==Mentors==
Mentors represent a wide variety of backgrounds and fields including arts, business, literature, public service, philanthropy, science and more.

'''Bloom's taxonomy''' is a set of three hierarchical models used to classify educational learning objectives into levels of complexity and specificity. The three lists cover the learning objectives in cognitive, affective and sensory domains. The cognitive domain list has been the primary focus of most traditional education and is frequently used to structure curriculum learning objectives, assessments and activities.

The models were named after [[Benjamin Bloom]], who chaired the committee of educators that devised the taxonomy. He also edited the first volume of the standard text, ''Taxonomy of Educational Objectives: The Classification of Educational Goals''.&lt;ref name="bloom1956"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bloom |first1=B. S. |author1-link=Benjamin Bloom |last2=Engelhart |first2=M. D. |last3=Furst |first3=E. J. |last4=Hill |first4=W. H. |last5=Krathwohl |first5=D. R. |author-link5=David Krathwohl |year=1956 |title=Taxonomy of educational objectives: The classification of educational goals |volume=Handbook I: Cognitive domain |place=New York |publisher=David McKay Company |ref={{sfnRef|Bloom et al.|1956}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="shane1981"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shane |first=Harold G. |title=Significant writings that have influenced the curriculum: 1906-1981 |year=1981 |journal=Phi Delta Kappan |volume=62 |issue=5 |pages=311–314 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Although named after Bloom, the publication of ''Taxonomy of Educational Objectives'' followed a series of conferences from 1949 to 1953, which were designed to improve communication between educators on the design of curricula and examinations.{{sfn|Bloom et al.|1956|p=4|ps=: "The idea for this classification system was formed at an informal meeting of college examiners attending the 1948 American Psychological Association Convention in Boston. At this meeting, interest was expressed in a theoretical framework which could be used to facilitate communication among examiners.}}

The first volume of the taxonomy, ''Handbook I: Cognitive''&lt;ref name="bloom1956" /&gt; was published in 1956, and in 1964 the second volume ''Handbook II: Affective'' was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Simpson |first=Elizabeth J. |title=The classification of educational objectives: Psychomotor domain |year=1966 |journal=Illinois Journal of Home Economics |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=110–144 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book |last=Harrow |first=Anita J. |year=1972 |title=A taxonomy of the psychomotor domain: A guide for developing behavioral objectives |place=New York |publisher=David McKay Company |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book |last=Dave |first=R.

== The cognitive domain (knowledge-based)==
In the original version of the taxonomy, the cognitive domain is broken into the following six levels of objectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Hoy |first=Anita Woolfolk |date=2007 |title=Educational psychology |edition=10th |location=Boston |publisher=Pearson/Allyn and Bacon |pages=530–531, 545 |isbn=0205459463 |oclc=68694368}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2001 revised edition of Bloom's taxonomy, the levels are slightly different: Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, Create (rather than Synthesize).&lt;ref name="anderaetal2001"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Armstrong|first1=Patricia|title=Bloom's Taxonomy|url=https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/blooms-taxonomy/|website=Vanderbilt University Center for Teaching|publisher=[[Vanderbilt University]]|accessdate=29 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Knowledge===
Knowledge involves recognizing or remembering facts, terms, basic concepts, or answers without necessarily understanding what they mean. Its characteristics may include:
*Knowledge of specifics—terminology, specific facts
*Knowledge of ways and means of dealing with specifics—conventions, trends and sequences, classifications and categories, criteria, methodology
*Knowledge of the universals and abstractions in a field—principles and generalizations, theories and structures

''Example'': Name three common varieties of apple.

===Comprehension===
Comprehension involves demonstrating understanding of facts and ideas by organizing, comparing, translating, interpreting, giving descriptions, and stating the main ideas.

''Example'': Compare the identifying characteristics of a Golden Delicious apple with a Granny Smith apple.

===Application===
Application involves using acquired knowledge—solving problems in new situations by applying acquired knowledge, facts, techniques and rules. Learners should be able to use prior knowledge to solve problems, identify connections and relationships and how they apply in new situations.

''Example'': Would apples prevent scurvy, a disease caused by a deficiency in vitamin C?

===Analysis===
Analysis involves examining and breaking information into component parts, determining how the parts relate to one another, identifying motives or causes, making inferences, and finding evidence to support generalizations. Its characteristics include:
*Analysis of elements
*Analysis of relationships
*Analysis of organization

''Example'': List four ways of serving foods made with apples and explain which ones have the highest health benefits. Provide references to support your statements.

===Synthesis===
Synthesis involves building a structure or pattern from diverse elements; it also refers to the act of putting parts together to form a whole. Its characteristics include:
*Production of a unique communication
*Production of a plan, or proposed set of operations
*Derivation of a set of abstract relations

''Example'': Convert an "unhealthy" recipe for apple pie to a "healthy" recipe by replacing your choice of ingredients. Explain the health benefits of using the ingredients you chose vs. the original ones.

===Evaluation===
Evaluation involves presenting and defending opinions by making judgments about information, the validity of ideas, or quality of work based on a set of criteria. Its characteristics include:
*Judgments in terms of internal evidence
*Judgments in terms of external criteria

''Example'': Which kinds of apples are best for baking a pie, and why?

==The affective domain (emotion-based)&lt;!--linked from 'Aesthetics'--&gt;==
Skills in the affective domain describe the way people react [[emotion]]ally and their ability to feel other living things' pain or joy. Affective objectives typically target the awareness and growth in [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]]s, emotion, and feelings.

There are five levels in the affective domain moving through the lowest-order processes to the highest.

===Receiving===
The lowest level; the student passively pays attention. Without this level, no learning can occur. Receiving is about the student's memory and recognition as well.

===Responding===
The student actively participates in the learning process, not only attends to a stimulus; the student also reacts in some way.

===Valuing===
The student attaches a value to an object, phenomenon, or piece of information. The student associates a value or some values to the knowledge they acquired.

===Organizing===
The student can put together different values, information, and ideas, and can accommodate them within his/her own schema; the student is comparing, relating and elaborating on what has been learned.

===Characterizing===
The student at this level tries to build abstract knowledge.

== The psychomotor domain (action-based) ==
Skills in the psychomotor domain describe the ability to physically manipulate a tool or instrument like a hand or a hammer. Psychomotor objectives usually focus on change and/or development in behavior and/or skills.

Bloom and his colleagues never created subcategories for skills in the psychomotor domain, but since then other educators have created their own psychomotor taxonomies.&lt;ref name="clark1999" /&gt; Simpson (1972)&lt;ref name= "simpson"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simpson|first1=Elizabeth|title=Educational objectives in the psychomotor domain|date=1972|volume=3|pages=25–30|url=https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED010368.pdf|accessdate=3 April 2018|publisher=Gryphon House|location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed the following levels:

===Perception===
The ability to use sensory cues to guide motor activity:  This ranges from sensory stimulation, through cue selection, to translation.

''Examples'': Detects non-verbal communication cues. Estimate where a ball will land after it is thrown and then moving to the correct location to catch the ball. Adjusts heat of the stove to correct temperature by smell and taste of food. Adjusts the height of the forks on a forklift by comparing where the forks are in relation to the pallet.

''Key words'': chooses, describes, detects, differentiates, distinguishes, identifies, isolates, relates, selects.

===Set===
Readiness to act: It includes mental, physical, and emotional sets. These three sets are dispositions that predetermine a person's response to different situations (sometimes called mindsets). This subdivision of psychomotor is closely related with the "responding to phenomena" subdivision of the affective domain.

''Examples'': Knows and acts upon a sequence of steps in a manufacturing process. Recognizes his or her abilities and limitations. Shows desire to learn a new process (motivation).

''Keywords'': begins, displays, explains, moves, proceeds, reacts, shows, states, volunteers.

===Guided response===
The early stages of learning a complex skill that includes imitation and trial and error: Adequacy of performance is achieved by practicing.

''Examples'': Performs a mathematical equation as demonstrated. Follows instructions to build a model. Responds to hand-signals of the instructor while learning to operate a forklift.

''Keywords'': copies, traces, follows, react, reproduce, responds.

===Mechanism===
The intermediate stage in learning a complex skill: Learned responses have become habitual and the movements can be performed with some confidence and proficiency.

''Examples'': Use a personal computer. Repair a leaking tap. Drive a car.

''Key words'': assembles, calibrates, constructs, dismantles, displays, fastens, fixes, grinds, heats, manipulates, measures, mends, mixes, organizes, sketches.

===Complex overt response===
The skillful performance of motor acts that involve complex movement patterns: Proficiency is indicated by a quick, accurate, and highly coordinated performance, requiring a minimum of energy. This category includes performing without hesitation and automatic performance. For example, players will often utter sounds of satisfaction or expletives as soon as they hit a tennis ball or throw a football because they can tell by the feel of the act what the result will produce.

''Examples'': Maneuvers a car into a tight parallel parking spot. Operates a computer quickly and accurately. Displays competence while playing the piano.

''Key words'': assembles, builds, calibrates, constructs, dismantles, displays, fastens, fixes, grinds, heats, manipulates, measures, mends, mixes, organizes, sketches. (Note: The key words are the same as in mechanism, but will have adverbs or adjectives that indicate that the performance is quicker, better, more accurate, etc.)

===Adaptation===
Skills are well developed and the individual can modify movement patterns to fit special requirements.

''Examples'': Responds effectively to unexpected experiences. Modifies instruction to meet the needs of the learners. Performs a task with a machine that was not originally intended for that purpose (the machine is not damaged and there is no danger in performing the new task).

''Key words'': adapts, alters, changes, rearranges, reorganizes, revises, varies.

===Origination===
Creating new movement patterns to fit a particular situation or specific problem: Learning outcomes emphasize creativity based upon highly developed skills.

''Examples'': Constructs a new set or pattern of movements organized around a novel concept or theory. Develops a new and comprehensive training program. Creates a new gymnastic routine.

''Key words'': arranges, builds, combines, composes, constructs, creates, designs, initiate, makes, originates.

==Definition of knowledge==
In the appendix to ''Handbook I'', there is a definition of knowledge which serves as the apex for an alternative, summary classification of the educational goals. This is significant as the taxonomy has been called upon significantly in other fields such as knowledge management, potentially out of context. "Knowledge, as defined here, involves the recall of specifics and universals, the recall of methods and processes, or the recall of a pattern, structure, or setting."{{sfn|Bloom et al.|1956|p=201}}

The taxonomy is set out as follows:
*1.00 Knowledge
**1.10 Knowledge of specifics
**1.11 Knowledge of terminology
**1.12 Knowledge of specific facts
**1.20 Knowledge of ways and means of dealing with specifics
**1.21 Knowledge of conventions
**1.22 Knowledge of trends and sequences
**1.23 Knowledge of classifications and categories
**1.24 Knowledge of criteria
**1.25 Knowledge of methodology
**1.30 Knowledge of the universals and abstractions in a field
**1.31 Knowledge of principles and generalizations
**1.32 Knowledge of theories and structures

==Criticism of the taxonomy==
As {{harvtxt|Morshead|1965}} pointed out on the publication of the second volume, the classification was not a properly constructed taxonomy, as it lacked a systemic rationale of construction.

This was subsequently acknowledged in the discussion of the original taxonomy in its 2001 revision,&lt;ref name="anderaetal2001" /&gt; and the taxonomy was reestablished on more systematic lines. 

Some critiques of the taxonomy's cognitive domain admit the existence of these six categories but question the existence of a sequential, hierarchical link.&lt;ref name="paul1993"&gt;{{cite book |last=Paul |first=R. |year=1993 |title=Critical thinking: what every person needs to survive in a rapidly changing world |edition=3rd |place=Rohnert Park, California |publisher=Sonoma State University Press |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, educators view the taxonomy as a hierarchy and may mistakenly dismiss the lowest levels as unworthy of teaching.&lt;ref name="Flannery"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Flannery |first=Maura C. |date=November 2007 |title=Observations on biology |journal=[[The American Biology Teacher]] |volume=69 |issue=9 |pages=561–564 |doi=10.1662/0002-7685(2007)69[561:OOB]2.0.CO;2 |url=https://www.nabt.org/websites/institution/File/pdfs/american_biology_teacher/2007/069-09-0561.pdf |quote=Biology is often referred to as an observational science almost as a slur, with the implication that biologists simply look at the living world without the strong theoretical and mathematic underpinnings of a science like physics. There is the suggestion that observation is easy. Thus biology is viewed as a lightweight science—anyone can do it: just go out and start looking, at birds, at grass, at cells under the microscope. Benjamin Bloom's taxonomy of learning tasks puts observation at the lowest level, with recall of information. This denigration of observation has long bothered me because I see it as often difficult and complex, a skill that needs to be learned and a talent that is much more developed in some.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lawler"&gt;{{cite web |last=Lawler |first=Susan |date=26 February 2016 |title=Identification of animals and plants is an essential skill set |publisher=[[The Conversation (website)|The Conversation]] |url=https://theconversation.com/identification-of-animals-and-plants-is-an-essential-skill-set-55450 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161117044125/http://theconversation.com/identification-of-animals-and-plants-is-an-essential-skill-set-55450 |archivedate=17 November 2016 |accessdate=5 March 2017 |quote=Ironically, the dogma that has been so detrimental to field taxonomy is known as Bloom's taxonomy. University lecturers are told to apply an educational theory developed by Benjamin Bloom, which categorises assessment tasks and learning activities into cognitive domains. In Bloom's taxonomy, identifying and naming are at the lowest level of cognitive skills and have been systematically excluded from University degrees because they are considered simplistic.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The learning of the lower levels enables the building of skills in the higher levels of the taxonomy, and in some fields, the most important skills are in the lower levels (such as identification of species of plants and animals in the field of [[natural history]]).&lt;ref name="Flannery"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lawler"/&gt; [[Instructional scaffolding]] of higher-level skills from lower-level skills is an application of [[Vygotskian]] [[Constructivism (philosophy of education)|constructivism]].&lt;ref name="vygotsky1978"&gt;{{cite book |last=Vygotsky |first=L. S. |author-link=Lev Vygotsky |year=1978 |title=Mind in society: the development of higher psychological processes |chapter=Chapter 6: Interaction between learning and development |pp=79–91 |place=Cambridge, Massachusetts |publisher=Harvard University Press |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Keene |first1=Judith |last2=Colvin |first2=John |last3=Sissons |first3=Justine |date=June 2010 |origyear=2010 |title=Mapping student information literacy activity against Bloom's taxonomy of cognitive skills |journal=Journal of Information Literacy |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=6–21 |doi=10.11645/4.1.189 |url=http://jil.lboro.ac.uk/ojs/index.php/JIL/article/view/PRA-V4-I1-2010-1 |quote=When supporting students outside the classroom situation, a subject aware advisor should be capable of spotting mistakes in a student's solution and of analysing these mistakes to identify the difficulty that the student is encountering. Such support can be seen as offering scaffolding in a student's 'zone of proximal development' (Vygotsky, 1978) and exemplified by teaching students to analyse a problem through the identification of the key elements and the relationships between these elements.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some consider the three lowest levels as hierarchically ordered, but the three higher levels as parallel.&lt;ref name="anderaetal2001" /&gt; Others say that it is sometimes better to move to Application before introducing concepts,{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} the idea is to create a learning environment where the real world context comes first and the theory second to promote the student's grasp of the phenomenon, concept or event. This 
thinking would seem to relate to the method of [[problem-based learning]].

Furthermore, the distinction between the categories can be seen as artificial since any given cognitive task may entail a number of processes. It could even be argued that any attempt to nicely categorize cognitive processes into clean, cut-and-dried classifications undermines the holistic, highly connective and interrelated nature of cognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Fadul |first=J. A.|title=Collective Learning: Applying distributed cognition for collective intelligence|journal=The International Journal of Learning|volume=16 | issue =4 |pages=211–220 |issn=1447-9494|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a criticism that can be directed at taxonomies of mental processes in general.

==Implications==
Bloom's taxonomy serves as the backbone of many teaching philosophies, in particular, those that lean more towards skills rather than content.&lt;ref name="krathwohl2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="anderaetal2001" /&gt; These educators view content as a vessel for teaching skills. The emphasis on higher-order thinking inherent in such philosophies is based on the top levels of the taxonomy including analysis, evaluation, synthesis and creation. Bloom's taxonomy can be used as a teaching tool to help balance assessment and evaluative questions in class, assignments and texts to ensure all orders of thinking are exercised in students' learning, including aspects of information searching.&lt;ref&gt;BJ Jansen, D Booth, B Smith (2009) [https://faculty.ist.psu.edu/jjansen/academic/pubs/jansen_using_the_taxonomy_of_cognitive_learning_to_model_online_searching.pdf Using the taxonomy of cognitive learning to model online searching], Information Processing &amp; Management 45 (6), 643-663&lt;/ref&gt;

==Connections across disciplines==
The skill development that takes place at these higher orders of thinking interacts well with a developing global focus on multiple literacies and modalities in learning and the emerging field of integrated disciplines.&lt;ref name="selander2012"&gt;*{{cite journal |last1=Kress |first1=G. |last2=Selander |first2=S. |year=2012 |title=Multimodal design, learning and cultures of recognition |journal=Internet and Higher Education |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=265–268 |doi=10.1016/j.iheduc.2011.12.003 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ability to interface with and create media would draw upon skills from multiple levels of the taxonomy including analysis, application and creation.&lt;ref name="paul2004"&gt;*{{cite book |last1=Paul |first1=R. |last2=Elder |first2=L. |year=2004 |title=Critical and creative thinking |place=Dillon Beach, CA |publisher=The Foundation for Critical Thinking |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="london1996"&gt;*{{cite book |author=The New London Group |year=1996 |title=A pedagogy of multiliteracies: designing social futures |publisher=Harvard Educational Review |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bloom's taxonomy (and the revised taxonomy) continues to be a source of inspiration for educational philosophy and for developing new teaching strategies.

In the U.S. [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]] model, 16 Career Clusters link to 70+ more specific Career Pathways – each have their own knowledge and skills requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Within the 70+ career pathways, 1800 Career Specialties are defined.  The structure has evolved over time and may vary by state.  The U.S. DOE Career Clusters framework is useful for connecting students with courses of study and careers via [[Career Assessments]], and allows them to learn general, more transferable skills at the cluster level, with more specific skills and knowledge acquired at the career pathways and specialty levels.  The nonprofit Vocational Research Institute adapted an interest and [[aptitude]] assessment, [[Careerscope]], to help students choose curriculum and careers for which they have both interest and aptitude - at the cluster, pathway and career specialty levels.  A concept related to Career Clusters, [[Small Learning Community]] is primarily concerned with restructuring secondary schools, in many cases using a career clusters framework.

==Background==
The Career Cluster initiative began in 1996 in the U.S. as the Building Linkages Initiative and was a collaborative effort between the U.S. Department of Education, the Office of Vocational and Adult Education (OVAE), the National School-to-Work Office (NSTWO) and the National Skill Standards Board (NSSB). The purpose of the Initiative was to establish linkages among State educational agencies, secondary and post-secondary educational institutions, employers, industry groups, other stakeholders and Federal agencies. The goal was to create curricular frameworks in broad career clusters, designed to prepare students to transition successfully from high school to post-secondary education and employment in a career area.

The creation of curricular models within the context of broad career clusters ensures the alignment of academic and technical instructional strategies with the requirements of post-secondary education and the expectations of employers in increasingly academic and technologically demanding careers.  The vocational education field has historically responded to the needs of the national economy by preparing individuals for in-demand jobs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ed.gov/legislation/FedRegister/announcements/2000-4/120600a.html  Federal Register  December 6, 2000]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Collaborative pedagogy''' stems from the [[theories of rhetoric and composition pedagogy|process theory of rhetoric and composition]]. Collaborative pedagogy believes that students will better engage with [[writing]], [[critical thinking]], and [[wikt:revising|revision]] if they engage with others.&lt;ref&gt;Bruffee, Kenneth A. “Collaborative Learning and the Conversation of Mankind.” The Norton Book of Composition Studies. Ed. Susan Miller. New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, 2009. 545 – 562. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Collaborative pedagogy pushes back against the Current-Traditional model of writing, as well as other earlier theories explaining rhetoric and composition; earlier theories of writing, especially [[Theories of rhetoric and composition pedagogy#Current-traditional rhetoric|current-traditional]], emphasizes writing as a final product (completed individually). In contrast, collaborative pedagogy rejects the notion that students think, learn, and write in isolation. Collaborative pedagogy strives to maximize critical thinking, [[learning]], and writing skills through interaction and inter-personal engagement.&lt;ref&gt;Peck, Wayne Campbell et al. “Community Literacy.” The Norton Book of Composition Studies.Ed. Susan Miller. New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, 2009. 1097 – 1116. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Collaborative pedagogy also connects to the broader theory of [[collaborative learning]], which encompasses other disciplines including, but not limited to, [[education]], [[psychology]], and [[sociology]].

In the rhetoric and composition discourse community, there exists much support for and debate about the use of collaborative learning in the classroom. Although collaborative pedagogy deals with the strategies associated with promoting engagement, critical thinking, and inclusivity, these theorists underscore collaborative pedagogy’s link to [[cultural studies]], [[argumentation]], community [[literacy]], [[Academic discourse#Academic discourse|academic discourse]], and university standards and policy connected with [[first-year composition]].&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomae, David. “Inventing the University.” When a Writer Can’t Write. Ed. Mike Rose. New York: Guildford, 1985. 134–165.&lt;/ref&gt;

Discussions of collaborative pedagogy also emerge in the [[Technical writing|technical communication]] field, a subset of rhetoric and composition. Technical communication incorporates collaborative pedagogy by attempting to bridge real work environments with university classrooms through group assignments.&lt;ref&gt;Blakeslee, Ann M. “Bridging the Workplace and the Academy: Teaching Professional Genres through Classroom-Workplace Collaborations.” Teaching Technical Communication: Critical Issues for the Classroom. Ed. James M. Dubinsky. 348–391. Print&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theorists in rhetoric and composition==

There are many rhetoric and composition theorists who explore collaborative pedagogy in their body of work. These theorists include, but are not limited to, [[Kenneth Bruffee|Kenneth A. Bruffee]], [[Cultural studies theory of composition|John Trimbur]], Joseph Harris, and Wayne Campbell Peck, [[Linda Flower]], and Lorraine Higgins. Kenneth Bruffee sees collaborative pedagogical strategies as natural to the learning process, more than individual thinking and learning.&lt;ref&gt;Bruffee, Kenneth A. “Collaborative Learning and the Conversation of Mankind.” The Norton Book of Composition Studies. Ed. Susan Miller. New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, 2009. 545 – 562. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; John Trimbur defines collaboration as admitting both dissent and agreement, and thinks that collaboration should not aim only for agreement.&lt;ref&gt;Trimbur, John. “Consensus and Difference in Collaborative Learning.” The Norton Book of Composition Studies. Ed. Susan Miller. New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, 2009. 733 – 747. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph Harris thinks that the university sometimes adversarial to collaborative pedagogy, since individual product is more highly valued.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Joseph. “The Idea of Community in the Study of Writing” The Norton Book of Composition Studies. Ed. Susan Miller. New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, 2009. 748 – 758. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Peck, Flower, and Higgins champion collaborative pedagogy as pivotal to reconciling various cultural, social, and socioeconomic difference.&lt;ref&gt;Peck, Wayne Campbell et al. “Community Literacy.” The Norton Book of Composition Studies.Ed. Susan Miller. New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, 2009. 1097 – 1116. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support and critique==
===As an aid to a natural state of interaction===

In “Collaboration and the ‘Conversation of Mankind’,” Kenneth A. Bruffee cites thinking out loud and collaborating as natural states of learning, because they mimic the process of earlier stages of development. Citing [[Michael Oakeshott]], Bruffee argues that “[w]e first experience and learn ‘the skill and partnership of conversation,’ in the external arena of direct social exchange with other people. Only then do we learn to displace that ‘skill and partnership by playing silently with ourselves, in imagination, the parts of all the participants in the conversation”.&lt;ref&gt;Bruffee, Kenneth A. “Collaborative Learning and the Conversation of Mankind.” The Norton Book of Composition Studies. Ed. Susan Miller. New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, 2009. 545 – 562. Print., p.549&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, he believes that the concepts of independent learning and thinking are more like social constructs than a natural state of being. Despite believing in Oakeshott’s theories about collaborative learning being natural, he acknowledges the difficulty of blending this with the independent and authoritative environment of the classroom, especially the college first-year composition classroom. Bruffee confronts the overarching fact that “[h]umanistic study, we have been led to believe, is a solitary life, and the vitality of the humanities lies in the talents and endeavors of each of us as individuals”.&lt;ref&gt;Bruffee, Kenneth A. “Collaborative Learning and the Conversation of Mankind.” The Norton Book of Composition Studies. Ed. Susan Miller. New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, 2009. 545 – 562. Print., p. 550&lt;/ref&gt; On a more minute level, collaborative pedagogy becomes problematic for instructors who worry that classrooms will spiral out of control, in “…an adversarial activity pitting individual against individual”.&lt;ref&gt;Bruffee, Kenneth A. “Collaborative Learning and the Conversation of Mankind.” The Norton Book of Composition Studies. Ed. Susan Miller. New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, 2009. 545 – 562. Print., p. 550&lt;/ref&gt; However, Bruffee thinks that if composition instructors and scholars believe in writing and learning as a process from which everyone can benefit, then it is important to forge community through collaboration, despite the individualist discourse of the university.

===As crossing socioeconomic boundaries===

Wayne Campbell Peck et al. view collaborative pedagogy in a positive light, due to its success at the Community Literacy Center (CLC), which pairs inner-city high school students with student mentors from [[Carnegie Mellon University]]. They describe a curriculum encouraging students to write responses to the real world situations they face, such as writing their school administrators about detention policies.&lt;ref&gt;Peck, Wayne Campbell et al. “Community Literacy.” The Norton Book of Composition Studies.Ed. Susan Miller. New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2009. 1097–1116. Print., p. 1107&lt;/ref&gt; Peck et al. justify the need for their program by positing that, “…beyond cultural appreciation, we believe that the next, more difficult step in community-building is to create an intercultural dialogue that allows people to confront and solve problems across racial and economic boundaries”.&lt;ref&gt;Peck, Wayne Campbell et al. “Community Literacy.” The Norton Book of Composition Studies.Ed. Susan Miller. New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, 2009. 1097 – 1116. Print., p. 1101&lt;/ref&gt; Their program attempts to reach this goal of inter-cultural dialogue by promoting multiple levels of interaction and understanding. First, the mentors from Carnegie Mellon and the inner-city youth must reach mutual understanding to promote clearer communication. Next, the students and administrators need to remain open to the others’ perspectives to develop stronger community. Last, the program coordinators need to view all parties involved as equal stakeholders.&lt;ref&gt;Peck, Wayne Campbell et al. “Community Literacy.” The Norton Book of Composition Studies.Ed. Susan Miller. New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, 2009. 1097 – 1116. Print., p. 1107–1111&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, they argue that their program, while often fraught with conflict, helps stakeholders in different positions understand varying perspectives about issues in their local community, and that this learning process is both necessary and beneficial.

===As counter intuitive to university culture and community===

A critique of collaborative pedagogy is that it juxtaposes the individual work production valued within the university. In “The Idea of Community in the Study of Writing,” Joseph Harris echoes Bruffee’s sentiments that the community and individual work at cross-purposes within the university setting. He claims that although the term "collaborative" usually connotes a positive sense of belonging, community in reality often creates an “us versus them” mentality, and also creating a dichotomy between individual and group, or in this case, student versus university. He wonders, “If to enter the academic community a student must ‘learn to speak our language’ [in reference to David Bartholomae’s “Inventing the University”], and become accustomed and reconciled to our ways of doing things with words, then how exactly is she to do this?”.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Joseph. “The Idea of Community in the Study of Writing” The Norton Book of Composition Studies. Ed. Susan Miller. New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, 2009. 748 – 758. Print., p.753&lt;/ref&gt; Issues of inclusion, exclusion, community, and individual relate to collaborative pedagogy, because first-year composition instructors struggle to promote critical thinking and collaborative learning, while also meeting the demands of college-level writing. Harris does not provide much consolation to this problem, except to say that students need to learn to navigate the complexities of individual and community identity.

===As critical engagement===

John Trimbur both supports and critiques collaborative pedagogy, but his support is predicated upon adjusting the views of both conflict and resolution. His article, “Consensus and Difference in [[Collaborative learning|Collaborative Learning]]," focuses on redefining the definition of “[[consensus]]” as it applies to collaborative pedagogy the first-year composition classroom. He argues that,

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;small&gt;To develop a critical version of collaborative learning, we will need to distinguish between consensus as an acculturative practice that reproduces business as usual and consensus as an oppositional one that challenges the prevailing conditions of production. The point of collaborative learning is not simply to demystify the authority of knowledge by revealing its social character but to transform the productive apparatus, to change the social character of production. In this regard, it will help to cast consensus not as a “real world” practice but as a utopian one (Trimbur, 743).&lt;ref&gt;Trimbur, John. “Consensus and Difference in Collaborative Learning.” The Norton Book of Composition Studies. Ed. Susan Miller. New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, 2009. 733 – 747. Print., p. 743&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After he links collaborative learning with his notion of the roll of consensus, he claims that “The revised notion of consensus I am proposing here depends paradoxically on its deferral, not its realization. I am less interested in students achieving consensus…as their using consensus as a critical to open gaps in the conversation through which differences may emerge”.&lt;ref&gt;Trimbur, John. “Consensus and Difference in Collaborative Learning.” The Norton Book of Composition Studies. Ed. Susan Miller. New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, 2009. 733–747. Print., p.745&lt;/ref&gt; This notion of consensus helps students build community and collaboration by grappling with issues that do not lend themselves so easily to consensus as agreement.

==Theorists in technical communication==

There are many technical communication scholars who explore collaborative pedagogy in their body of work. These theorists include, but are not limited to, Aviva Freedman, Christine Adam, Ann M. Blakeslee, and Robert J. Johnson. Aviva Freedman and Christine Adam view the traditional classroom model as detrimental to students/future employees, because the classroom prevents critical thinking, independence, collaboration, and cooperation between coworkers.&lt;ref&gt;Freedman, Aviva and Christine Adam. “Learning to Write Professionally: ‘Situated Learning’ and the Transition from University to Professional Discourse.” Teaching Technical Communication: Critical Issues for the Classroom. Ed. James M. Dubinsky. 310–336. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Ann M. Blakeslee believes that the classroom and the workplace can blend together for new learning, as long as both parties remain open to communication.&lt;ref&gt;Blakeslee, Ann M. “Bridging the Workplace and the Academy: Teaching Professional Genres through Classroom-Workplace Collaborations.” Teaching Technical Communication: Critical Issues for the Classroom.

===Technical communication views collaborative pedagogy===

The works of the [[Scholarly method|scholars]] listed above and in the references section primarily deal with the [[wikt:conundrum|conundrum]] of preparing students for [[Collaborative working environment|collaborative work environments]], when most of their work occurs individually and in a [[classroom]] environment. Freedman and Adam worry that the classroom creates trained in capacities in students, preventing them from adapting to a work world where authoritative boundaries are blurred and most stakeholders are equal.&lt;ref&gt;Freedman, Aviva and Christine Adam. “Learning to Write Professionally: ‘Situated Learning’ and the Transition from University to Professional Discourse.” Teaching Technical Communication: Critical Issues for the Classroom. Ed. James M. Dubinsky. 310–336. Print., pp. 325–327&lt;/ref&gt; Blakeslee notes that even when instructors try to bring the “real world” into the classroom, businesses and students still struggle to communicate clearly.&lt;ref&gt;Blakeslee, Ann M. “Bridging the Workplace and the Academy: Teaching Professional Genres through Classroom-Workplace Collaborations.” Teaching Technical Communication: Critical Issues for the Classroom. Ed. James M. Dubinsky. 348–391. Print., p.365 – 367&lt;/ref&gt; Robert J. Johnson makes the theoretical claim that [[Prewriting#Motivation and audience awareness|audience awareness]] is central to technical communication as a practice, but that the university purposefully separates writer from audience, which does not promote collaborative pedagogy or learning.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Robert J. "Audience Involved: Toward a Participatory Model of Writing." College Composition and Communication 14 (1997): 361–376. JSTOR. 7 Nov. 2012., p. 363&lt;/ref&gt; However, he further argues that for communication to succeed in any setting, audience must be “involved” rather than removed from the process of communicating.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Robert J. "Audience Involved: Toward a Participatory Model of Writing." College Composition and Communication 14 (1997): 361–376. JSTOR. 7 Nov. 2012., p. 363&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Contextual learning''' is based on a [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivist]] theory of teaching and learning.&lt;ref name=Hull&gt;{{cite book|last=Hull|first=D|title=Opening Minds, Opening Doors: The Rebirth of American Education|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2013}} Learning takes place when teachers are able to present information in a way that students are able to construct meaning based on their own experiences. Contextual learning experiences include [[intern]]ships, [[service learning]], and [[study abroad]] programs, among others.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nsee.org&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=April 2013}}

Contextual learning has the following characteristics:
* emphasizing problem solving
* recognizing that teaching and learning need to occur in multiple contexts
* assisting students in learning how to monitor their learning and thereby become self-regulated learners
* anchoring teaching in the diverse life context of students{{clarify|date=April 2013}}
* encouraging students to learn from each other
* employing authentic assessment{{clarify|date=April 2013}}

==Key elements==
Current perspectives on what it means for learning to be contextualized include
* situated cognition – all learning is applied knowledge
* social cognition – intrapersonal constructs
* distributed cognition – constructs that are continually shaped by other people and things outside the individual

Constructivist learning theory maintains that learning is a process of constructing meaning from experience&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Imel|first=S|title=Contextual learning in adult education|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2013}}&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eric.ed.gov/PDFS/ED448304.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; {{cn-span|text=Contextual learning may be useful for child development if it provides learning experiences in a context in which children are interested and motivated. Various experiential learning theorists have contributed to an understanding of contextual learning.|date=April 2013}}

==Benefits==
{{POV-section|date=April 2013}}
* Both direct instruction and constructivist activities can be compatible and effective in the achievement of learning goals.{{clarify|date=April 2013}}&lt;ref name=resnick&gt;{{cite book|last=Resnick &amp; Hall|title=Learning organizations for sustainable education reform|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2013}}
* Increasing one’s efforts results in more ability. This theory opposes the notion that one’s aptitude is unchangeable. Striving for learning goals motivates an individual to be engaged in activities with a commitment to learning.{{clarify|date=April 2013}}&lt;ref name=resnick /&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2013}}
* Children learn the standards values, and knowledge of society by raising questions and accepting challenges to find solutions that are not immediately apparent. Other learning processes are explaining concepts, justifying their reasoning and seeking information. Therefore, learning is a social process which requires social and cultural factors to be considered during instructional planning. This social nature of learning also drives the determination of the learning goals.{{clarify|date=April 2013}}&lt;ref name=borko&gt;{{cite book|last=Borko &amp; Putnam|title=The role of context in teacher learning and teacher education|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2013}}
* Knowledge and learning are situated in particular physical and social context. A range of settings may be used such as the home, the community, and the workplace, depending on the purpose of instruction and the intended learning goals.&lt;ref name = borko /&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2013}}
* Knowledge may be viewed as distributed or stretched over&lt;ref name=lave&gt;{{cite book|last=Lave|first=J|title=Cognition in practice: Mind, mathematics and culture in everyday life|year=1988|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2013}} the individual, other persons, and various artifacts such as physical and symbolic tools&lt;ref name=salomon&gt;{{cite book|last=Salomon|first=G|title=Distributed cognitions|year=1993|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{page needed|date=April 2013}} and not solely as a property of individuals. Thus, people, as an integral part of the learning process, must share knowledge and tasks.&lt;ref name = borko /&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2013}}

== Assessment ==
One of the main goals of contextual learning is to develop an authentic task to assess performance.   Creating an assessment in a context can help to guide the teacher to replicate a real world experiences and make necessary inclusive design decisions.  Contextual learning can be used as a form of formative assessment and can help give educators a stronger profile on how the intended learning goals, standards and benchmarks fit the curriculum.  It is essential to establish and align the intended learning goals of the contextual task at the beginning to create a shared understanding of what success looks like.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wiggins|first1=Grant|last2=McTighe|first2=Jay|title=Understanding love by Design: Professional Development Workbook|date=2004|publisher=Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development|location=Alexandria, VA|isbn=0-87120-855-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Self-determination_theory|Self-directed theory]] states that humans by nature seek purpose and the desire to make a contribution and to be part of a cause greater and more enduring then oneself.  Contextual learning can help bring relevance and meaning to the learning, helping students relate to the world they live in. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pink|first1=Daniel|title=[[Drive:  The surprising truth about what motivates us]]|date=2009|publisher=Riverhead Books|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-1594488849}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Questions to address when defining and developing a contextual task ==
* Does the task fulfill the intended learning goals?
* Does the task involve problems that require the students to use their knowledge creatively to find a solution?
* Is the task an engaging learning experience?
* Is the audience as authentic as possible?
* Does the task require students to use processes, products and procedures that simulate those used by people working in a similar field?  
* Is the task inclusive?
* Are there clear criteria for students on how the product, performance or service will be evaluated?
* Are there models of excellence which demonstrate standards?
* Are the students involved in the assessment process?
* Is there a provision made for continuous formative feedback, from oneself, from teachers and peers to help the students improve?
* Is there an opportunity for student choice and ownership to the extent that would be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wiggins|first1=Grant|last2=McTighe|first2=Jay|title=Understanding by Design: Professional Development Workbook|date=2004|publisher=Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development|location=Alexandria, VA|isbn=0-87120-855-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cultural-historical activity theory''' ('''CHAT''')&lt;ref&gt;Or [[activity theory]] (AT), as it is also known. {{harvnb|Kaptelinin|Nardi|2006|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a theoretical framework&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nardi|1996|page=7}} notes that activity theory is a "''a research framework and set of perspectives''", not a hard and fast methodology or strongly predictive single theory.&lt;/ref&gt; which helps to understand and analyse the relationship between the human mind (what people think and feel) and activity (what people do).&lt;ref name="Daniels10"&gt;{{harvnb|Daniels|et al.|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KaptNard6"&gt;{{harvnb|Kaptelinin|Nardi|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roth|Lee|2007|page=192}}: ''"CHAT was conceived of as a concrete psychology immersed in everyday [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/praxis praxis]"'': "''consciousness is located in everyday practice: you are what you do''" {{harvnb|Nardi|1996|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It traces its origins to the founders&lt;ref&gt;In the 1920s till the mid 1930s.&lt;/ref&gt; of the cultural-historical school of Russian psychology [[L. S. Vygotsky]]&lt;ref name="bioBook"&gt;Yasnitsky, A. (2018). [https://www.routledge.com/Vygotsky-An-Intellectual-Biography/Yasnitsky/p/book/9781138806740 Vygotsky: An Intellectual Biography]. London and New York: Routledge [http://individual.utoronto.ca/yasnitsky/texts/Yasnitsky_2018_Vygotsky_bookPreview.pdf BOOK PREVIEW]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Aleksei N. Leontiev]].&lt;ref&gt;Leontiev may at times also be spelled as Leontyev and Leont'ev.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Enge99"&gt;{{harvnb|Engeström|Miettinen|Punamaki|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;It is well known that the Soviet philosopher of psychology [http://www.panrus.com/books/details.php?bookID=20579 S.L.Rubinshtein], independently of Vygotsky's work, developed his own variant of activity as a philosophical and psychological theory. re: V. Lektorsky in {{harvnb|Engeström|Miettinen|Punamäki|1999|p=66}};[http://resources.iupsys.net/iupsys/index.php/iupsysresources/565-iupsys-bib-2000/43662-the-activity-approach-and-psychology-2004-  Brushlinskii, A. V. 2004] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20140901165544/http://resources.iupsys.net/iupsys/index.php/iupsysresources/565-iupsys-bib-2000/43662-the-activity-approach-and-psychology-2004- |date=1 September 2014 }}. Engeström would be happy to also include [in the account of A.T.] reference to Luria, Zinchenko (father, Peter, and son, Vladimir), Elkonin, Davydov, Brushlinsky and Rubstov (as well as to various other figures who have influenced activity-theory in the West, such as Dewey, Mead, and Wittgenstein). {{harvnb|Bakhurst|2009|page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Political restrictions in its country of origin (Stalinist Russia) had suppressed the cultural-historical psychology – also known as the Vygotsky School – in the mid-thirties. This meant that the core "[[Activity theory|activity]]" concept remained confined to the field of psychology, although {{harvnb|Blunden|2010}}, in "''An Interdisciplinary Theory of Activity''", argues that it has the potential to evolve as a genuinely interdisciplinary concept. See also {{harvnb|Nussbaumer|2012|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vygotsky's important insight into the dynamics of consciousness was that it is essentially subjective and shaped by the history of  each individual's social and cultural experience.&lt;ref name="Vyg78"/&gt; Especially since the 1990s, CHAT has attracted a growing interest among academics worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kaptelinin|Nardi|2006}} Introduction&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere CHAT has been defined as "a cross-disciplinary framework for studying how humans purposefully transform natural and social reality, including themselves, as an ongoing culturally and historically [[Situated learning|situated]], materially and socially [[Cultural mediation|mediated]] process".&lt;ref&gt;CHAT explicitly incorporates the mediation of activities by ''society'', which means that it can be used to link concerns normally independently examined by sociologists of education and (social) psychologists. {{harvnb|Roth|Lee|2007}} and {{harvnb|Roth|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Core ideas are: 1) humans act collectively, learn by doing, and communicate in and via their actions; 2) humans make, employ, and adapt tools of all kinds to learn and communicate; and 3) community is central to the process of making and interpreting meaning – and thus to all forms of learning, communicating, and acting.&lt;ref name="Leont78"&gt;{{harvnb|Leontiev|1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Activity Theory in a Nutshell. Ch 3 in {{harvnb|Kaptelinin|Nardi|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term CHAT was coined by Michael Cole&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cole|1996|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; and popularized by Yrjö  Engeström&lt;ref&gt;The activity theoretical framework, as recently as the 1990s, was still referred to as "''one of the best kept secrets of academia''" {{harvnb|Engeström|1993|page=64}}; {{harvnb|Roth|Lee|2007|page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; to promote the unity of what, by the 1990s, had become a variety of currents&lt;ref&gt;Prominent among those currents are [[Cultural-historical psychology]], in use since the 1930s, and [[Activity theory]] in use since the 1960s.&lt;/ref&gt; harking back to Vygotsky's work.&lt;ref name="Stets05"&gt;{{harvnb|Stetsenko|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yama07"&gt;{{harvnb|Yamagata|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical overview==

===Origins: revolutionary Russia===
CHAT traces its lineage to [[dialectical materialism]], classical [[German philosophy]],&lt;ref name="Enge99"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In particular Goethe's [http://home.mira.net/~andy/works/goethe.htm romantic science] ideas which were later taken up by [[Hegel]]. The meaning of "activity" in the conceptual sense is rooted in the German word ''Tätigkeit''. Hegel is considered the first philosopher to point out that the development of humans' knowledge is not spiritually given, but developed in history from living and working in natural environments.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blunden, A. 2012, [http://home.mira.net/~andy/works/origins-chat.htm "The Origins of Cultural Historical Activity Theory"] ; Blunden, A. [http://ethicalpolitics.org/chat/Genealogy-CHAT.htm Genealogy of CHAT] (graph).&lt;/ref&gt; and the work of [[Lev Vygotsky]], [[Aleksei N. Leontiev]] and [[Aleksandr Luria]], known as ''"the founding troika"''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Blunden|2011|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Cultural-historical psychology|cultural-historical]] approach to [[Social Psychology]]. In a radical departure from the [[behaviorism]] and [[reflexology]] that dominated much of psychology in the early 1920s, they formulated, in the spirit of [[Karl Marx]]'s [[Theses on Feuerbach]], the concept of activity, i.e., "artifact-mediated and object-oriented action".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vygotsky|1978|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"''A human individual never reacts directly (or merely with inborn reflexes) to the environment. Consciousness and conscious action must be the central object of study for psychological science, since it is this that distinguishes humanity. The relationship between human agent and objects of environment is mediated by cultural means, tools and signs. Human action has a tripartite structure.''"({{harvnb|CRADLE|2009}})&lt;/ref&gt; By bringing together the notion of history and culture in the understanding of human activity, they were able to transcend the [[Cartesian dualism]] between subject and object, internal and external, between people and society, between individual inner consciousness and the outer world of society.&lt;ref&gt;At the beginning of and into the mid-20th century, Psychology was dominated by schools of thought that ignored real life processes in psychological functioning (e.g. [[Gestalt psychology]], [[Behaviorism]] and [[Cognitivism (psychology)]]).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lev Vygotsky]], who created the foundation of cultural-historical psychology, based on the concept of mediation, published six books on psychology topics during a working life which spanned only ten years. He died of TB in 1934 at the age of 37. A.N. Leont'ev worked with Lev Vygotsky and Alexandr Luria from 1924 to 1930, collaborating on the development of a [[Marxist psychology]]. Leontiev left Vygotsky's group in Moscow in 1931, to take up a position in [[Kharkov]]. There he was joined by local psychologists, including Pyotr Galperin and [[Pyotr Zinchenko]].&lt;ref&gt;For a history of what came to be known as the [[Kharkov School of Psychology]] re: Yasnitsky &amp; Ferrari, 2008 in: History of Psychology Vol. 11, No. 2, 101–121.&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to work with Vygotsky for some time but, eventually, there was a split, although they continued to communicate with one another on scientific matters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/understanding-vygotsky-a-quest-for-synthesis/oclc/786677274?referer=null&amp;ht=edition Veer and Valsiner, 1991]&lt;/ref&gt; Leontiev returned to Moscow in 1934. Contrary to popular belief, Vygotsky's work per se was never banned in Stalinist&lt;ref&gt;''When Stalin succeeded Lenin in 1924, the Soviet Union gradually turned into a dictatorship. This led to 30 years of stagnation during which intellectuals and academics who deviated from the Stalinist ideology were politically attacked for their work and eventually eliminated. Vygotsky's colleagues had to flee to Ukraine for safety.'' [http://tap.sagepub.com/content/21/5/557.full.pdf+html Sannino &amp; Sutter, 2011] p. 563. Stalin died in 1953 and restrictions were subsequently gradually relaxed.&lt;/ref&gt; Soviet Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, J. &amp; Yasnitsky, A. (2015). [http://individual.utoronto.ca/yasnitsky/texts/Fraser%20&amp;%20Yasnitsky%20(2015).pdf Deconstructing Vygotsky’s Victimization Narrative: A Re-Examination of the "Stalinist Suppression" of Vygotskian Theory]. History of the Human Sciences, April 2015 28 (special issue on Vygotsky's legacy: "Vygotsky in His, Our and Future Times"): 128-153, {{DOI|10.1177/0952695114560200}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950 A.N.Leontiev became the Head of the Psychology Department at the Faculty of Philosophy of the [[Lomonosov Moscow State University]] (MGU). This department became an independent Faculty in 1966 due mainly to his hard work. He remained there until his death in 1979. Leontiev's formulation of activity theory, post 1962, had become the new "official" basis for Soviet psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wertsch|1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the two decades between a thaw in the suppression of scientific enquiry in Russia and the death of the Vygotsky's continuers,&lt;ref&gt;In the late 1970s, an entire generation of Soviet psychologists died: Luria and Meshcheryakov died in 1977, Leontiev and Ilienkov in 1979. (Ilienkov by his own hand. – see: [http://home.mira.net/~andy/works/soviet-psychology.htm Blunden, 2009 "Soviet Cultural Psychology"]).&lt;/ref&gt; contact was made with the West.

===Developments in the West===
Michael Cole, then a young [[Indiana University]] psychology post-graduate exchange student, arrived in Moscow in 1962 for a one-year stint of research under Alexandr Luria. Keenly aware of the gulf between Soviet and American psychology, he was one for the first Westerners to present Luria's and Vygotsky's idea to an Anglo-Saxon public.&lt;ref&gt;e.g.: Luria's [http://www.marxists.org/archive/luria/works/1979/mind/ "The Making of Mind"] translated by Cole.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.mira.net/~andy/works/soviet-psychology.htm Blunden, 2009].&lt;/ref&gt; This, and a steady flow of books translated from the Russian&lt;ref&gt;The earliest books translated into English are Lev Vygotsky's [http://www.marxists.org/archive/vygotsky/works/words/ "Thought and Language"](1962), Luria's [https://www.marxists.org/archive/luria/works/1976/problem.htm "Cognitive Development"] (1976), Leontiev's [http://www.marxists.org/archive/leontev/works/1978/index.htm|title= Activity, Consciousness, and Personality] (1978) and Wertsch's [http://news.wustl.edu/people/Pages/WertschJamesV.aspx "The Concept of Activity in Soviet Psychology"] (1981).&lt;/ref&gt; ensured the gradual establishment of a solid Cultural Psychology base in the west.&lt;ref&gt;"Historians may come to identify in Michael Cole the single most influential person for acquainting Western scholars to this tradition, both through his writings and through the mediating role of his Laboratory for Comparative Human Cognition (LCHC) at the University of California, San Diego" ({{harvnb|Roth|2007|page=190}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Another American scholar, James V. Wertsch, after completing his PhD at the [[University of Chicago]] in 1975, spent a year as a postdoctoral fellow in Moscow to study linguistics and neuropsychology.

===The three generations of activity theory===
In his 1987 ''"Learning by expanding"'', Engeström&lt;ref name="Enge87"&gt;{{harvnb|Engestrōm|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; offers a very detailed account of the diverse sources, philosophical and psychological, that inform activity theory. In subsequent years, however, a simplified picture has emerged from his and other researchers' work, namely the idea that (to date) there are three principal 'stages' or 'generations'&lt;ref&gt;'Generations' does not imply a 'better-worse' value judgment. Each illustrates a different aspect and exists in its own right.&lt;/ref&gt; of activity theory, or "cultural-historical activity theory (CHAT).&lt;ref name="Eng09b"&gt;{{harvnb|Engeström|2009b}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yama10"&gt;{{harvnb|Yamagata|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nussbaumer|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Enge99a"&gt;{{harvnb|Engeström|1999a}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bakh09"&gt;{{harvnb|Bakhurst|2009|page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst the first generation built on Vygotsky's notion of mediated action, from the individual's perspective, and the second generation built on Leont'ev's notion of activity system, with emphasis on the collective,&lt;ref&gt;An activity system is a collective in which one or more human actors labor to cyclically transform an object (a raw material or problem) in order to repeatedly achieve an outcome (a desired result). {{harvnb|Spinuzzi|2012|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; the third generation, which appeared in the mid-nineties, builds on the idea of multiple interacting activity systems focused on a partially shared object, and boundary-crossings between them.&lt;ref name="Eng09b"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0742051X08001698 | doi=10.1016/j.tate.2008.09.014 | volume=25 | issue=3 | title=Using activity systems analysis to identify inner contradictions in teacher professional development | year=2009 | journal=Teaching and Teacher Education | pages=507–517 | last1 = Yamagata-Lynch | first1 = Lisa C. | last2 = Haudenschild | first2 = Michael T.}}; Engeström, 2008, [http://lchc.ucsd.edu/mca/Paper/ISCARkeyEngestrom.pdf "The Future of Activity Theory" p. 6].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AkkerBakker"&gt;{{harvnb|Akkerman|Bakker|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====First generation – Vygotsky====
The first generation emerges from Vygotsky's theory of [[cultural mediation]], which was a response to [[behaviorism]]'s explanation of consciousness, or the development of the human mind, by reducing "mind" to a series of atomic components or structures associated primarily with the brain as "stimulus – response" (S-R) processes. Vygotsky argued that the relationship between a human subject and an object is never direct but must be sought in society and culture as they evolve historically, rather than in the human brain or individual mind unto itself.&lt;ref&gt;Vygotsky saw the past and present as fused within the individual, that the "''present is seen in the light of history''" ({{harvnb|Vygotsky|1978}}).&lt;/ref&gt; His cultural-historical psychology attempted to account for the social origins of language and thinking.  To Vygotsky, consciousness emerges from human activity mediated by artifacts (tools) and signs.&lt;ref name="Vyg78"&gt;{{harvnb|Vygotsky|1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;These artifacts, which can be physical tools, such as hammers, ovens, or computers; cultural artifacts, including language; or theoretical artifacts, like algebra or feminist standpoint theory, are created and/or transformed in the course of an activity, which, in the first generation framework, happens at the individual level.&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Vygotsky Basic Mediated Action.jpg|thumb|285px|First Generation CHAT]] This idea of semiotic mediation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wells | first1 = G | year = 2007 | title = Semiotic Mediation, Dialogue and Construction of Knowledge | url = http://people.ucsc.edu/~gwells/Files/Papers_Folder/Semiotic%20Mediation%20and%20Ed.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Human Development | volume = 50 | issue = 5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is embodied in Vygotsky's famous triangular model&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vygotsky|1978|page=40}}: this original diagram – (in which "X" stands for 'mediation') – has subsequently been reformulated by, among others, the original [http://www.cs.hut.fi/u/aura/paivin_seminaari/activity_theory.pdf triangle] being inverted.&lt;/ref&gt; which features the Subject (S), Object (O), and Mediating Artifact triad:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Engeström|2001|page=134}}. Vygotsky's triangular representation of mediated action attempts to explain human consciousness development in a manner that did not rely on dualistic stimulus–response (S-R) associations.&lt;/ref&gt; in mediated action the Subject, Object, and Artifact stand in a dialectical relationship whereby each affects the other and the activity as a whole.&lt;ref name="Stets05"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yama07"&gt;{{harvnb|Yamagata|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"''the dialectic relationship between subject and object as a fundamental unit of analysis for all human endeavour''" {{harvnb|Hasan|2007|page=3.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For Vygotsky's idea of a ''"complex, mediated act"'' commonly expressed as a triad of subject, object and mediating artifact, see {{harvnb|Vygotsky|1987|page=40.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vygotsky argues that the use of signs leads to a specific structure of human behavior, which breaks away from mere biological development allowing the creation of new forms of culturally-based psychological processes – hence the importance of (cultural-historical) context: individuals could no longer be understood without their cultural environment, nor society without the ''agency'' of the individuals who use and produced these artifacts. The objects became cultural entities, and action oriented towards the objects became the key to understanding the human psyche.&lt;ref&gt;Vygotsky makes the point that ''"man himself determines his behavior with the help of an artificially created stimulus means."'' (as cited by Norris Minick in Vol I of "The Collected Works of L.S. Vygotsky", 1987, PLENUM – New York/London, p.21);&lt;/ref&gt; In the Vygotskyan framework the unit of analysis, however, remains principally the individual. First-generation activity theory has been used to understand individual behavior by examining the ways in which a person's objectivized actions are culturally ''mediated''.&lt;ref&gt;''Mediation'' is perhaps the key theoretical idea behind activity: we don't just use tools and symbol systems; instead, our everyday lived experience is significantly mediated and intermediated by our use of tools and symbols systems. Activity theory helps frame, therefore, our understanding of such mediation.&lt;/ref&gt;  Besides a strong focus on material and symbolic mediation, internalization&lt;ref&gt;In Vygotskyan psychology internalization is a theoretical concept that explains how individuals process what they learned through mediated action in the development of individual consciousness.&lt;/ref&gt; of external (social, societal, and cultural) forms of mediation, another important, aspect of first generation CHAT is the concept of the [[zone of proximal development]] (ZPD),&lt;ref name="Vyg78"&gt;{{harvnb|Vygotsky|1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning, as advanced in ''Mind in Society'' (1978), ''"the distance between the actual developmental level as determined by independent problem solving and the level of potential development as determined through problem solving under adult guidance or in collaboration with more capable peers"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vygotsky|1978|page=86}} –  Restated, ZPD is the theoretical range of what a performer can do with competent peers and assistance, as compared with what can be accomplished on one's own({{harvnb|Andersson|2013|page=21}}; DeVane &amp; Squire in {{harvnb|Jonassen|Land|2012|page=245}}).&lt;/ref&gt; ZDP is one of the major legacies of Vygotsky's work in the social sciences.&lt;ref&gt;see for example [[Collaborative learning]].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Second generation – Leontiev====
While Vygotsky formulated practical human activity as the general explanatory category in human psychology, he did not fully clarify its precise nature. The second generation moves, beyond Vygotsky's individually-focused to A.N. Leontiev's&lt;ref&gt;Leontiev, (variously spelled Leont'ev/Leontyev) was, with [[Alexander Luria]], one of Vygotsky's pupils in the late 1920s and 1930s. After Vygotsky's death, Leontyev became the principal theoretical contributor within the Vygotskian social-historical school.&lt;/ref&gt; collective model. In Engeström's&lt;ref name="Enge87"/&gt; now famous graphic depiction of second-generation activity, the unit of analysis has been expanded to include collective motivated activity toward an object, making room for understanding how collective action by social groups mediates activity.&lt;ref&gt;Leontiev's breakthrough was twofold: first he theorized activity as resulting from the confluence of a human subject, the object of his/her activity (predmet/[[w:ru:Предмет|Предмет(Russian)]] "the target or content of a thought or action" (Kaptelinin, 2005, p. 6), and the tools (including symbol systems) that mediate the object(ive); second, he saw activity as essentially tripartite in structure, being composed of unconscious operations on/with tools, conscious but finite actions which are goal-directed, and higher level activities which are object-oriented and driven by motives (Leontiev, at times, seems to conflate object and motive, which is potentially problematic).&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the inclusion of ''community'', ''rules'', ''division of labor'' and the importance of analyzing their interactions with each other.&lt;ref name="Enge99a"/&gt; Rules may be explicit or implicit. Division of labor refers to the explicit and implicit organization of the community involved in the activity.  Engeström&lt;ref name="Enge87"/&gt; articulated the clearest distinction between classic Vygotskian psychology, which emphasizes the way semiotic and cultural systems mediate human ''action'', and Leontiev's second-generation  CHAT, which is focused on the meditational effects of the systemic organization of human ''activity''. [[File:Second Generation CHAT.jpg|thumb|285px|Second Generation CHAT]] In insisting that activity only exists in relation to rules, community and division of labor, Engeström expands ''the unit of analysis'' for studying human behavior from that of individual activity to a collective ''activity system''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Engeström|1987}} first popularized the triangular representation of the activity system in chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;While the ''unit of analysis'', for Vygotsky, is "individual activity" and, for Leontiev, the "collective activity system", for [[Jean Lave]] and others working around [[situated cognition]] the unit of analysis is "practice", "[[community of practice]]", and "participation". Other scholars analyze "the relationships between the individual's psychological development and the development of social systems". re: Minick in {{harvnb|Cole|Engeström|Vasquez|1997|page=125}}; {{harvnb|Lave|Wenger|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collective ''activity system'' includes the social, psychological, cultural and institutional perspectives in the analysis. In this conceptualization context or activity systems are inherently related to what Engeström argues are the deep-seated material practices and socioeconomic structures of a given culture. These societal dimensions had not been taken sufficiently into account by Vygotsky's, earlier, more 'simple' triadic model:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leontiev|1979|page=163}};{{harvnb|Engeström|1999|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hard07"&gt;{{harvnb|Hardman|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Leontiev's understanding, thought and cognition should be understood as a part of social life – as a part of the means of production and systems of social relations on one hand, and the intentions of individuals in certain social conditions on the other.&lt;ref name="Leont78"&gt;{{harvnb|Leontiev|1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In the second generation diagram, activity is positioned in the middle, mediation at the top, adding rules, community and division of labor at the bottom. The minimum components of an ''activity system'' are:  the subject; the object; outcome; mediating instruments/tools/artifacts; rules and signs; community and division of labor.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his famous example of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20041110023910/http://home.hio.no/~kristihh/1_lektor/paper/hunt.htm 'primeval collective hunt'],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leontiev|1981|page=210–213}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leontiev clarifies the crucial difference between an individual ''action'' ("the beater frightening game") and a collective ''activity'' ("the hunt"). While individuals' actions (frightening game) are different from the overall ''goal'' of the activity (hunt), they all share in the same ''motive'' (obtaining food). ''Operations'', on the other hand, are driven by the conditions and tools at hand, i.e. the objective circumstances under which the hunt is taking place. To understand the separate actions of the individuals, one needs to understand the broader ''motive'' behind the activity as a whole: this accounts for the three hierarchical levels of human functioning:&lt;ref name="Enge87"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kuutti, K. in {{harvnb|Nardi|1996|page=30}};  {{harvnb|Roth|Lee|2007}}; {{harvnb|Hardman|2007}}; {{harvnb|Bozalek, et al.|2014|page=15.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''object''-related motives drive the collective activity (top); ''goals'' drive individual/group action(s) (middle); ''conditions'' and ''tools'' drive automated operations (lower level).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leontyev|2009|page=400–405}} ; {{harvnb|Blunden|2011|page=201}}; {{harvnb|Nussbaumer|2012|page=39}}; DeVane &amp; Squire in {{harvnb|Jonassen|Land|2012|page=247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Third generation – Engeström et al.====
After Vygotsky's foundational work on the individual's higher psychological functions&lt;ref name="Vyg78"&gt;{{harvnb|Vygotsky|1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Leontiev's extension of these insights to collective activity systems,&lt;ref&gt;Engeström in {{harvnb|Engeström|Miettinen|Punamäki|1999|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; questions of diversity and dialogue between different traditions or perspectives became increasingly serious challenges, when, especially in the post-1990s, activity theory 'went international'. The work of Michael Cole and Yrjö Engeström in the 1970s and 1980s – mostly in parallel, but occasionally in collaboration – brought activity theory to a much wider audience of scholars in Scandinavia and North America.&lt;ref&gt;"[Activity Theory]  ''is not only used in Russia, where it originated, but also in Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Norway, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK, the United States and other countries.''". ({{harvnb|Kaptelinin|Nardi|2006|page=6}})&lt;/ref&gt; Once the lives and biographies of all the participants and the history of the wider community are taken into account, ''multiple activity systems'' need to be considered, positing, according to Engeström, the need for a "third generation" to "''develop conceptual tools to understand dialogue, multiple perspectives, and networks of interacting activity Systems''".&lt;ref&gt;"''Activities do not exist in isolation, they are part of a broader system of relations in which they have meaning.''" ({{harvnb|Lave|Wenger|1991|page=53.}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Enge01"&gt;{{harvnb|Engeström|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Enge09a"&gt;{{harvnb|Engeström|2009a}}&lt;/ref&gt; This larger canvas of active individuals (and researchers) embedded in organizational, political, and discursive practices constitutes a tangible advantage of second- and third-generation CHAT over its earlier Vygotskian ancestor, which focused on mediated action in relative isolation&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roth|Lee|2007|page=210}}&lt;/ref&gt; Third generation activity theory is the application of ''Activity Systems Analysis'' (ASA)&lt;ref name="Yama10"&gt;{{harvnb|Yamagata|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See "Activity Systems Analysis" (ASA) section below.&lt;/ref&gt; in developmental research where investigators take a participatory and interventionist role in the participants' activities and change their experiences. [[File:Third Generation CHAT.jpg|thumb|285px|Third Generation CHAT]] Engeström's&lt;ref name="Enge87"/&gt; now famous diagram, or ''basic activity triangle'', – (which adds rules/norms, intersubjective community relations, and division of labor, as well as multiple activity systems sharing an object) – has become the principal third generation model among the research community for analysing individuals and groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Blunden|2012|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Engeström summarizes the current state of CHAT with five principles:
# The activity system as primary unit of analysis: the basic third generation model includes minimally two interacting activity systems. 
# Multi-voicedness: an activity system is always a community of multiple points of views, traditions and interests.
# Historicity: activity systems take shape and get transformed over long stretches of time. Potentials and problems can only be understood against the background of their own histories. 
# The central role of contradictions as sources of change and development.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Engeström|2001|page=137.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# Activity Systems' possibility for ''expansive transformation'' (cycles of qualitative transformation):  when object and motive are reconceptualized a radically wider horizon opens up.&lt;ref name="Enge01"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nygård|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Most often, learning technologists have used third-generation CHAT as a guiding theoretical framework to understand how technologies are adopted, adapted, and configured through use in complex social situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jonasen|Land|2012|page=242}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hardman|2007}} Introduction: "''A flurry of recent publications indicates that Activity Theory is proving a useful tool for studying work setting''" She mentions, among others, Product design, Collaborative activity, Studies in creativity, Educational interventions. Although not as widely known in the US, [http://faculty.washington.edu/kfoot/Publications/Foot-CHAT-explored-dist-tf.pdf Kirsten Foot] mentions use of CHAT in Educational curricula development, Mental health care, Organizational processes and Public policy.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;More recently, Engeström has acknowledged that the third generation model limited to analysing 'reasonably well-bounded' systems and that, in view of new, often web-based participatory practices a rethink is needed. (See "[[#"Fourth generation"|Fourth Generation]]" below.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Informing research and practice==

===Leontiev and social development===
From the 1960s onwards, starting in the [[global South]], and independently from the mainstream ''European'' developmental line,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Z4WqwWken_kC&amp;pg=PA128&amp;lpg=PA128&amp;dq=axel+european+line+theories&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jQTHZvJ3ed&amp;sig=m3dzzzJcHM_-xLC5FnaxsxdKgXE&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjd5vvV1rDVAhXIBsAKHVmwCTMQ6AEIMDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=axel%20european%20line%20theories&amp;f=false Erik Axel]&lt;/ref&gt; Leontiev's core  ''Objective Activity'' concept&lt;ref&gt;From the original [[w:ru:Предметная деятельность|Предметная деятельность(Russian)]] (predmetnaja-dejatelnost) and [[w:de:Gegenständliche Tätigkeit|Gegenständliche Tätigkeit(German)]], commonly translated 
as [[w:es: Actividad objetivada|"Actividad Objetivada"(Spanish)]] – see: {{harvnb|Leontiev|1984|page=66}}, and as ''Objective Activity'' in English: e.g. Chapter 3 of {{harvnb|Leontiev|1978|page=50ss}}, {{harvnb|Wertsch|1979|page=46ss}} and {{harvnb|Miettinen|2005}} Abstract:'Leontiev's concept of practice or Objective Activity'. (For ''"Objectivis/zed"'',  see e.g.: {{harvnb|Leontiev|1978|page=116}}: "Activity's secondary ''objectivised'' existence" and {{harvnb|Leontyev|1977|page=404}}: "the mental image ''objectivised'' in its product"). "''Objectivized Activity''" is perceived to be closer to both the letter and the spirit of dynamic, interactive, dialectical weighting of Leontiev's original ''predmetnaya dyaetel'nost''.&lt;/ref&gt; has been used in a Social Development context. In the [[Organization Workshop]]'s [[Large Group Capacitation]]-method,&lt;ref&gt;''"Laboratories on Objectivized Activity"'' in: {{harvnb|Labra|Labra|2012}}; {{harvnb|Labra|1992}}: [[w:es: Actividad objetivada|''"Actividad Objetivada"''(Spanish)]] p. 53; ''"de Morais' antecedent thought on Objectivised Activity"'' in {{harvnb|Andersson|2004|page=221 ss}};  {{harvnb|Carmen|Sobrado|2000|page=118}} &amp; note No. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; ''objective/ized activity'' acts as the core causal principle which postulates that, in order to change the mind-set of (large groups of) individuals, we need to start with changes to their activity – and/or to the object that "suggests" their activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Andersson|2013|page=5ss}} (Pre booklaunch chapter from ''"Unbounded Organization: Embracing the Societal Enterprise"'').&lt;/ref&gt; In Leontievian vein, the Organization Workshop is all about semiotically-mediated activities through which (large groups of) participants&lt;ref&gt;Many of whom, historically, unemployed or underemployed persons with 'Lower Levels of Literacy' (LLLs)&lt;/ref&gt;  ''learn how to manage themselves and the organizations they create to perform tasks that require a complex division of labor''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Andersson|2013|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===CHAT-inspired research and practice since the 1980s===
Especially over the last two decades, CHAT has offered a theoretical lens informing research and practice, in that it posits that learning takes place through collective activities that are purposefully conducted around a common object.  Starting from the premise that learning is a social and cultural process that draws on historical achievements, its [[systems thinking]]-based perspectives allow insights into the real world.&lt;ref name="Enge01"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Enge09a"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mutizwa Mukute, M.&amp; Lotz-Sisitka, H. 2012 [http://lchc.ucsd.edu/mca/Journal/pdfs/19-4-mukute.pdf "Working With Cultural-Historical Activity Theory and Critical Realism to Investigate and Expand Farmer Learning in Southern Africa"].

====Change Laboratory (CL)====
Change Laboratory (CL) is a CHAT-based method for formative intervention in activity systems and for research on their developmental potential as well as processes of expansive learning, collaborative concept-formation, and transformation of practices, elaborated in the mid-nineties&lt;ref&gt;In 1997, according to [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=6880603 Santally et al., 2014, p. 3]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sannino, 2008 [http://lchc.ucsd.edu/mca/Journal/pdfs/15-3-sannino.pdf "From Talk to Action: Experiencing Interlocution in Developmental Interventions"] Sannino sees in Yves Clot's Vygotsky-inspired [http://tap.sagepub.com/content/21/5/681.full.pdf '''Clinic of Activity'''] (''Clinique de l'Activité'') a potentially complementary – (to CL, that is) – intervention method. (See also Clot, Yves, 2009 [http://lchc.ucsd.edu/MCA/Mail/xmcamail.2012_01.dir/pdfHqmCdPgVef.pdf Clinic of Activity: The Dialogue as Instrument] in {{harvnb|Sannino|et al|2009}}).&lt;/ref&gt; by the Finnish Developmental Work Research [http://www.edu.helsinki.fi/activity/ (DWR)] group.&lt;ref&gt;Which became [http://www.helsinki.fi/cradle/ CRADLE] in 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Enge05a"&gt;{{harvnb|Engeström|2005a}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The CL method relies on collaboration between the practitioners of the activity being analyzed and transformed, and academic researchers or interventionists supporting and facilitating collective developmental processes.&lt;ref name="Enge01"/&gt; On the basis of Engeström's theory of ''expansive learning'',&lt;ref name="Enge87"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Expansive learning is described by {{harvnb|Engeström|2008|page=130}} as a process which "''begins with individual subjects questioning accepted practices, and it gradually expands into a collective movement or institution.'' – The theory enables a "''longitudinal and rich analysis of inter-organizational learning [] by using observational as well as interventionist designs in studies of work and organization''". ([http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/pdfplus/10.1108/13665620710777084 Engeström &amp; Kerosuo, 2007])&lt;/ref&gt; the foundation of an interventionist research approach at DWR&lt;ref name="Enge05a"/&gt; was elaborated in the 1980s, and developed further in the 1990s as an intervention method now known as ''Change Laboratory''.&lt;ref name="EngeVirkk"&gt;{{harvnb|Engeström|Virkkunen et al.|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "CRAD09"&gt;{{harvnb|CRADLE|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; CL interventions are used both to study the conditions of change and to help those working in organizations to develop their work, drawing on participant observation, interviews, and the recording and videotaping of meetings and work practices.  Initially, with the help of an external interventionist, the first stimulus that ''is beyond the actors' present capabilities'', is produced in the Change Laboratory by collecting first-hand empirical data on problematic aspects of the activity. This data may comprise difficult client cases, descriptions of recurrent disturbances and ruptures in the process of producing the outcome. Steps in the CL process: Step 1 Questioning; Step 2 Analysis;  Step 3 Modeling; Step 4 Examining; Step 5 Implementing; Step 6 Reflecting; Step 7 Consolidating.  These seven action steps for increased understanding are described by Engeström as ''expansive learning'', or phases of an outwardly expanding spiral,&lt;ref&gt;Virkkunen, Makinen &amp; Lintula in {{harvnb|Daniels|et al.|2010|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; while multiple kinds of actions can take place at any time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Engestrőm|Sannino|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phases of the model simply allow for the identification and analysis of the dominant action type during a particular period of time. These learning actions are provoked by contradictions.&lt;ref&gt;Engeström. Y. in: {{harvnb|Engeström|Miettinen|Punamäki|1999|page=384}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Contradictions are not simply conflicts or problems, but are "''historically accumulating structural tensions within and between activity systems''" ({{harvnb|Engeström|2001|page= 137}}).&lt;/ref&gt; CL is used by a team or work unit or by collaborating partners across the organizational boundaries, initially with the help of an interventionist-researcher.&lt;ref name="Foot14"&gt;{{harvnb|Foot|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EngeVirkk"/&gt; The CL method has been used in agricultural contexts,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. [http://xa.yimg.com/kq/groups/14514153/1465618386/name/14.%20Cultural%20Historical%20Activity%20Theory%20Expansive%20Learning%20and%20Agency%20in%20Permaculture.pdf Mukute, M., 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; educational and media settings,&lt;ref&gt;[https://helda.helsinki.fi/handle/10138/19805 Teräs, M., 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; health care&lt;ref&gt;[http://ethesis.helsinki.fi/julkaisut/kay/kasva/vk/kerosuo/abstract.html Kerosuo, H., 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tap.sagepub.com/content/21/5/598.short Engeström, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; and learning support.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=6880603 Santally et al., 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Other examples, among others, in {{harvnb|Daniels|et al.|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Activity systems analysis (ASA)====
''Activity systems analysis'' is a CHAT-based method,&lt;ref&gt;Which uses Activity Theory concepts such as mediated action, goal-directed activity and dialectical relationship between the organism and the environment.&lt;/ref&gt; discussed in {{harvnb|Engeström|1987}}/{{harvnb|Engeström|1993}} and in Cole &amp; Engeström, 1993,&lt;ref&gt;Cole, M., &amp; Engeström, Y. (1993). "A cultural–historical approach to distributed cognition" in: [https://www.amazon.com/Distributed-Cognitions-Psychological-Considerations-Computational/dp/0521574234 Salomon, G (Ed), 1993.]&lt;/ref&gt; for understanding human activity in real-world situations with data collection, analysis, and presentation methods that address the complexities of human activity in natural settings aimed to advance both theory and practice. It is based on Vygotsky's concept of mediated action and captures human activity in a triangle model that includes the subject, tool, object, rule, community, and division of labor.&lt;ref name="Enge87"/&gt; Subjects are participants in an activity, motivated toward a purpose or attainment of the object. The object can be the goal of an activity, the subject's motives for participating in an activity, and the material products that subjects gain through an activity. Tools are socially shared cognitive and/or material resources that subjects can use to attain the object. Informal or formal rules regulate the subject's participation while engaging in an activity. The community is the group or organization to which subjects belong. The division of labor is the shared participation responsibilities in the activity determined by the community. Finally, the outcome is the consequences that the subject faces because of his/her actions driven by the object. These outcomes can encourage or hinder the subject's participation in future activities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/2593117/Activity_systems_analysis_methods Yamagata "Activity Systems Analysis Methods]&lt;/ref&gt; In Part 2 of her video "''Using Activity Theory to understand human behaviour''", {{harvnb|vanderRiet|2010}} shows how activity theory is applied to the problem of behavior change and HIV and AIDs (in South Africa). The video focuses on sexual activity as the activity of the system, and illustrates how an ''Activity System Analysis'', through a historical and current account of the activity, provides a way of understanding lack of behavior change in response to HIV and AIDS. In her eponymous book ''"Activity Systems Analysis Methods."'', {{harvnb|Yamagata|2010|page=37ss}} describes seven ASA case studies which fall ''"into four distinct work clusters. These clusters include works that help (a) understand developmental work research (DWR), (b) describe real-world learning situations, (c) design human computer interaction systems, and (d) plan solutions to complicated work-based problems"''.

====Human–computer interaction (HCI)====
When HCI&lt;ref&gt;[[Human-Computer Interaction]] – the study, planning, design and uses of the interfaces between people ([[user (computing)|user]]s) and computers.&lt;/ref&gt; first appeared on the scene as a separate field of study in the early 1980s, HCI adopted the [[information processing]] paradigm of computer science as the model for human cognition, predicated on prevalent [[cognitive psychology]] criteria, which, it was soon realized, failed to account for individuals' interests, needs and frustrations involved, nor of the fact that the technology critically depends on complex, meaningful, social, and dynamic contexts in which it takes place.&lt;ref&gt;Kuutti in {{harvnb|Nardi|1996|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kaptelinin|Nardi|2006|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adopting a CHAT theoretical perspective had important implications for understanding how people use interactive technologies: the realization, for example, that a computer is typically an object of activity rather than a mediating artefact means that people interact with the world through computers, rather than with computer 'objects'.&lt;ref name="KaptNard6"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaptelinin, Victor "Activity Theory" in {{harvnb|Soegaard|Friis|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Susanne Bødker|Bødker, S.]] "A Human Activity approach to User Interfaces"  in: [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1207/s15327051hci0403_1 Human-Computer Interaction, 1989, Volume 4, pp.171–195]&lt;/ref&gt; A number of diverse methodologies outlining techniques for human–computer interaction design have emerged since the rise of the field in the 1980s. Most design methodologies stem from a model for how users, designers, and technical systems interact. [[Bonnie Nardi]] produced the – hitherto – most applicable collection of activity theoretical HCI literature.&lt;ref name="KaptNard6"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nardi|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Systemic-structural activity theory (SSAT)====
SSAT builds on the general theory of activity to provide an effective basis for both experimental and analytic methods of studying human performance, using carefully developed units of analysis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bedny | first1 = G. | last2 = Karwowski | first2 = W. | year = 2003 | title = A Systemic-Structural Activity Approach to the Design of Human–Computer Interaction Tasks | url = | journal = International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction | volume = 16 | issue = 2| pages = 235–260 | doi=10.1207/s15327590ijhc1602_06| citeseerx = 10.1.1.151.8384 }}&lt;/ref&gt; SSAT approaches cognition both as a process and as a structured system of actions or other functional information-processing units, developing a taxonomy of human activity through the use of structurally organized units of analysis. The systemic-structural approach to activity design and analysis involves identifying the available means of work, tools and objects; their relationship with possible strategies of work activity; existing constraints on activity performance; social norms and rules; possible stages of object transformation; and changes in the structure of activity during skills acquisition.This method is demonstrated by applying it to the study of a human–computer interaction task.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bedny, I.|Karwowski, W.|Bedny G.|2014}}; {{cite journal | doi = 10.1080/10447310903575507 | volume=26 | issue=4 | title=A Method of Human Reliability Assessment Based on Systemic-Structural Activity Theory | year=2010 | journal=International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction | pages=377–402 | last1 = Bedny | first1 = I.

==Future==

===Evolving field of study===
The strengths of CHAT are grounded both in its long historical roots and extensive contemporary use: it offers a philosophical and cross-disciplinary perspective for analyzing diverse human practices as development processes in which both individual and social levels are interlinked, as well as interactions and boundary-crossings.&lt;ref name="AkkerBakker"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crossing boundaries involves "''encountering difference, entering into [] unfamiliar territory, requiring cognitive retooling''".  Tuomi-Grōhn &amp; Engeström, 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=pU-ZCkQExcIC  "New Perspectives on Transfer and Boundary Crossing" p.4.]&lt;/ref&gt; between activity systems&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Engeström|1999c}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kuutti, N. Ch 2 in {{harvnb|Nardi|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, the focus of studies of organizational learning has increasingly shifted away from learning within single organizations or organizational units, towards learning in multi‐organizational or inter‐organizational networks, as well as to the exploration and better understanding of interactions in their social context, multiple contexts and cultures, and the dynamics and development of particular activities. This shift has generated, among others, such concepts as "networks of learning"&lt;ref&gt;Miettinen in {{harvnb|Engeström|et al.|1999|page=325}} "Transcending traditional school learning: Teachers' work and networks of learning."&lt;/ref&gt; and "[[networked learning]]",&lt;ref&gt;Wikipedia, launched in 2001, is one of the most successful instances of networked learning to date.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Engeström|Kerosuo|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[coworking]],&lt;ref name= "EngSann"&gt;{{harvnb|Sannino|et al.|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and knotworking.&lt;ref name="Enge04"&gt;{{harvnb|Engeström|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Spinuzzi|2011}}; {{harvnb|Spinuzzi|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Industry of late has seen strong growth in nonemployer firms (NEFs), thanks to changes in long-term employment trends and developments in mobile technology&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. {{harvnb|Castells|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; which have led to more work from remote locations, more distance collaboration, and more work organized around temporary projects.&lt;ref name="Spin14"&gt;{{harvnb|Spinuzzi|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developments such as these and new forms of social production or [[commons-based peer production]], such as e.g. [[open source]]&lt;ref&gt;Software, the source code of which is available for modification or enhancement by anyone.&lt;/ref&gt; development and cultural production in [[peer-to-peer]] (P2P) networks, have become a key focus in Engeström's more recent work.&lt;ref name="Enge04"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Social production processes are simultaneous, multi-directional and often reciprocal. The density and complexity of these processes blur distinctions between process and structure. The object of the activity is unstable, resists control and standardization, and requires rapid integration of expertise from various locations and traditions. (Engeström in {{harvnb|Sannino|et al.|2009|page=309}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. [https://web.archive.org/web/20150128132610/http://www.open.ac.uk/opencetl/files/opencetl/file/ecms/web-content/Engestrom-(2007)-From-communities-of-practice-to-mycorrhizae.pdf Engeström] in: [https://books.google.com/books?hl=es&amp;lr=&amp;id=Mv6H0dm1CvgC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1985&amp;dq=Communities+of+practice:+Critical+perspectives&amp;ots=O3Ye0f0Uop&amp;sig=ZSIypdAKreTaGxOdWl-TxbClnfA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Communities%20of%20practice%3A%20Critical%20perspectives&amp;f=false Hughes, Jewson &amp; Unwin, 2007] Ch. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Fourth generation"===
The rapid rise of new forms of activities characterised by web-based social and participatory practices,&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. Spinuzzi, 2010: shift from bureaucracies (1970s), to adhocracies (1990s), to all-edge adhocracies (2010s), in: [http://www.slideshare.net/spinuzzi/all-edge-understanding-the-new-workplace-networks "''All Edge: Understanding the New Workplace Networks''".]&lt;/ref&gt; 
,&lt;ref&gt;By 2008, Engeström's examples become 'less bounded': ''runaway objects'' – or 'partially shared large-scale objects in complex, distributed multi-activity fields'-, ''wildfire'', and ''mycorrhizae-like'' activities, are examples of this shift. ({{harvnb|Engeström|2009b}}; Engeström in {{harvnb|Sannino|2009|page=310}}; {{harvnb|Spinuzzi|2011}}).&lt;/ref&gt; phenomena such as [[distributed workforce]] and the dominance of knowledge work, prompts a rethink of the third generation model, bringing with it the need, as suggested by Engestrōm, for a new, ''fourth generation'' activity system model.&lt;ref&gt;aka "4GAT" e.g. {{harvnb|Spinuzzi|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sannino|et al.|2009|page=310}} Ch. 19 "The Future of Activity Theory: A rough draft."&lt;/ref&gt; which activity theorists indeed have been working on in recent years.&lt;ref name="Daniels10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EngSann"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fourth Generation (4GAT) analysis should allow better examination of how activity networks interact and interpenetrate, and, at times, contradict each other. People "''working alone together''" may illuminate other examples of distributed, interorganizational, collaborative knowledge work.{{harvnb|Spinuzzi|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fourth generation CHAT, the object(ive) will typically comprise multiple perspectives and contexts and be inherently transient; collaborations between actors, too, are likely to be temporary, with multiple boundary crossings between interrelated activities.&lt;ref name="AkkerBakker"/&gt; Fourth-generation activity theorists have specifically developed activity theory to better accommodate Castells's (and others') insights into how work organization has shifted in the [[network society]]: they hence will focus less on the workings of individual activity systems (often represented by triangles) and more on the interactions across activity systems functioning in networks.&lt;ref name="Spin14"&gt;{{harvnb|Spinuzzi|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Yamazumi|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For an example of a fourth generation analytical diagram see {{harvnb|Spinuzzi|2014|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2017 ISCAR congress (August, Quebec City) has the following theme: ''''Taking a 360° view of the landscape of cultural-historical activity research:The state of our scholarship in practice''.

The '''Deutscher Lehrerpreis''' is a [[teacher award]] in [[Germany]]. It is awarded in two major categories: the first category awards teachers who exhibit innovative teaching practices, and the second category allows students to nominate their teachers for responsible student-teacher collaboration. The award was created and is organized by the [[Vodafone Foundation]] and the [[German Philological Association]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vodafone-stiftung.com/eng_german_teaching_award.html Vodafone foundation website: description of the German teaching award in English]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dphv.de/wettbewerbe/lehrerpreis-unterricht-innovativ.html German philological website: description of the German teaching award]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
It is supported by German education researchers, such as Professor Dr. Jürgen Baumert who is the vice-president of the [[Max Planck Institute for Human Development]] in Berlin and who conducted the [[Programme for International Student Assessment]] (PISA) study, and German politicians such as Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bundeskanzlerin.de/ContentArchiv/DE/Archiv17/Artikel/2011/11/2011-11-30-deutscher-lehrerpreis.html Article on the official website of chancellor Angela Merkel about the German teaching award]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Award categories==
The award was created by the [[Vodafone Foundation]], the German Philological Foundation, German politicians and education professors, intending to reward the work of teachers and improve public appreciation of teachers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title=Der Lehrerpreis: Ideen und Ziele|url=http://www.lehrerpreis.de/?id=18|website=Deutscher Lehrerpreis|accessdate=5 March 2016|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 2011 award ceremony, German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] said: "''We need teachers with a passion. They are the ones that are responsible for the quality of a school.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Deutscher Lehrerpreis für hervorragenden Unterricht|url=https://www.bundeskanzlerin.de/ContentArchiv/DE/Archiv17/Artikel/2011/11/2011-11-30-deutscher-lehrerpreis.html|website=Die Bundeskanzlerin|publisher=Presse- und Informationsamt der Bundesregierung|accessdate=5 March 2016|language=German|date=30 November 2011|quote="Wir brauchen Lehrerinnen und Lehrer mit Leidenschaft. Sie sind es, die über die Qualität einer Schule entscheiden."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Deutscher Lehrerpreis is awarded in two major categories. The first category is awarded for innovative teaching practices. Teachers from German secondary schools can apply with their projects, and a total of 13,000 Euros are awarded. The second category is awarded for responsible cooperation between students and teachers. Students who are about to graduate or have already graduated may nominate their teachers for the second category.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kultur-bildet.de/wettbewerb/deutscher-lehrerpreis-unterricht-innovativ description of the teaching award and the two categories by Deutscher Kulturrat e.V. sponsored by the Bundesminsterium für Bildung und Forschung]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media coverage==
The German teaching [[award]] always finds a wide media coverage in the German media each year. These articles describe the competition and discuss the importance of good teachers in [[Germany]].

'''Dropping out''' means leaving [[high school]], college, university or another group for practical reasons, necessities, or disillusionment with the system from which the individual in question leaves.

== Canada ==
In Canada, most individuals graduate grade 12 by the age of 18, according to Jason Gilmore who collects data of employment and education using the Labour Force Survey. The LFS is the official survey used to collect unemployment data in Canada (2010). Using this tool, assessing educational attainment and school attendance can calculate a dropout rate (Gilmore, 2010). It was found by the LFS that by 2009, 1 in 12 20-24-year-old adults did not have a high school diploma (Gilmore, 2010). It was also found by the study that men still have higher drop out rates than women, and that students outside of major cities and in the northern territories also have a higher risk of dropping out. Although since 1990, dropout rates have gone down from 20% to a low of 9% in 2010, it does not seem to be dropping since this time (2010).{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

The average Canadian dropout earns $70 less per week than their peers with a high school diploma. Graduates (without post-secondary) earned an average of $621 per week, whereas dropout students earned an average of $551 (Gilmore, 2010).

Even though dropout rates have gone down in the last 20–25 years,  the concerns of the impact dropping out has on the labor market is very real (Gilmore, 2010). One in four students without a high school diploma who were in the labor market in 2009-2010 had less likelihood of finding a job due to economic, downturn (Gilmore, 2010).

==United Kingdom==
In the United Kingdom, a dropout is anyone who leaves school, college or university without either completing their course of study or transferring to another educational institution. Dropping out of school is not allowed. Attendance at a school is mandatory until age 16 (GCSE exams) and students must be in some form of education or training (either full-time or part-time) until age 18.

Dropout rate benchmarks are set for each higher education institution and monitored by the [[Higher Education Funding Council for England]] (HEFCE), the [[Higher Education Funding Council for Wales]] (HEFCW) and the [[Scottish Funding Council]] (SFC).&lt;ref name="BBC News 19 Dec 2001"&gt;{{cite web|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title= University drop-out rates |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/1719435.stm |accessdate=2 December 2014 |website= news.bbc.co.uk| date=19 December 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dropout rates are often one of the factors assessed when [[Rankings of universities in the United Kingdom|ranking UK universities]] in league tables.

In November 2014, a report from the  [[Institute for Fiscal Studies]] found that students from poorer home backgrounds were 8.4 percentage points more likely to drop out of university in the first two years of an undergraduate course than those from the richest homes; they were also 22.9 percentage points less likely to obtain a [[2:1]] or [[British undergraduate degree classification#First-class honours|first]] [[British undergraduate degree classification|degree]]. For students studying on the same course and who arrived at university with similar grades, the differences fell but remained significant. The report concluded that more should be done both to raise the attainment levels of poorer students prior to their arrival at university and to provide additional support to them at university.&lt;ref name="BBC News 4 Nov 2014"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-29895964|title= University 'drop-out risk for poorer students|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=4 November 2014 |website=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
{{Main article|High school dropouts in the United States}}

In the United States, dropping out most commonly refers to a [[student]] quitting school before he or she graduates or avoiding entering a [[university]] or [[college]]. It cannot always be ascertained that a student has dropped out, as he or she may stop attending without terminating enrollment. It is estimated 1.2 million students annually drop out of high school in the United States, where high school graduation rates rank 19th in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dosomething.org/tipsandtools/11-facts-about-dropping-out High School Dropouts - Do Something]. ''Do Something.'' Retrieved on 2013-12-14.&lt;/ref&gt; Reasons are varied and may include: to find [[employment]], avoid [[bullying]], family emergency, poor grades, [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and other [[mental illnesses]], [[Teenage pregnancy|unexpected pregnancy]], bad environment, lack of freedom, and [[boredom]]. ''The Silent Epidemic: Perspectives of High School Dropouts''&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.gatesfoundation.org/Documents/TheSilentEpidemic3-06FINAL.pdf The Silent  Epidemic: Perspectives of High School Dropouts]. ''Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation.'' Retrieved on 2013-12-14.&lt;/ref&gt; by Civic Enterprises explores reasons students leave school without 
graduating. The consequences of dropping out of school can have long-term economic and social repercussions. Students who drop out of school in the United States are more likely to be 
unemployed, homeless, receiving welfare and incarcerated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nodropouts.org NoDropouts.org]. ''NoDropouts.org.'' Retrieved on 2013-12-14&lt;/ref&gt; A four-year study in [[San Francisco]] found that 94 percent of young murder victims were high school dropouts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/opinion/editorials/article/Tough-solutions-for-high-school-truancy-rate-3178477.php Tough solutions for high school truancy rate - SFGate]. ''SFGate''. Retrieved on 2013-12-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of Education]]'s measurement of the ''status'' dropout rate is the percentage of 16-24-year-olds who are not enrolled in school and have not earned a high school credential.&lt;ref name="nces"&gt;NCES 2011&lt;/ref&gt; This rate is different from the event dropout rate and related measures of the status completion and average freshman completion rates.&lt;ref name="nces1"&gt;NCES 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The status high school dropout rate in 2009 was 8.1%.&lt;ref name="nces" /&gt; There are many [[At-risk students|risk factors]] for high school dropout. These can be categorized into social and academic risk factors. Members of racial and ethnic minority groups drop out at higher rates than white students, as do those from low-income families, from single-parent households, and from families in which one or both parents also did not complete high school.&lt;ref name="lee"&gt;Lee 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Students at risk for dropout based on academic risk factors are those who often have a history of absenteeism and grade retention, academic trouble, and more general disengagement from school life.&lt;ref name="lee" /&gt;

== Australia ==
In Australia, dropping out most commonly refers to a student quitting school before he or she graduates. Reasons for students dropping out vary but usually include: Avoiding bullies, finding employment, family problems, depression and other mental illnesses, teenage pregnancy, substance abuse and in some cases even boredom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fall|first=Anna-Mária|last2=Roberts|first2=Greg|title=High school dropouts: Interactions between social context, self-perceptions, school engagement, and student dropout|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140197111001497|journal=Journal of Adolescence|volume=35|issue=4|pages=787–798|doi=10.1016/j.adolescence.2011.11.004|pmc=3478125|pmid=22153483|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers at Melbourne's Mitchell Institute has found that a quarter of Australian high school students are not graduating year 12, and that completion rates are much worse in remote or economically disadvantaged communities. Professor Teese believes the segregation of students in schools through geography as well as in the private and public systems means student disadvantage is stronger in Australia than other western nations such as New Zealand and Canada.&lt;ref name="abc.net.au"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-10-26/quarter-of-high-school-students-drop-out/6884578|title=One in four Australian students drop out of high school|date=2015-10-26|website=ABC News|language=en-AU|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drop out rates vary throughout different locations in Australia. Students that attend school in remote communities have a higher chance of not completing year 12 (56.6%), whereas students that come from a wealthy background share an average completion rate of 90%.&lt;ref name="abc.net.au"/&gt; These remote schooling programs serve primarily indigenous students. Geography and lack of resources cause indigenous students to have lower rates of completion: the gap between indigenous and non-indigenous year 12 graduates is over 40 percentage points. As a result of this substantial difference, lower socioeconomic students who drop out are considered [[At-risk students|at-risk-students]] and are ultimately prone to unemployment, incarceration, low-paying employment and having children at early ages.

== Latin America ==
{{Main|School dropouts in Latin America}}

When analysing the household surveys of some countries in the [[Latin America]]n region – notably, those of [[Bolivia]], [[Chile]], [[Panama]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Nicaragua]] and [[Paraguay]] – researching the opinions of boys, girls, adolescents, young people as well as their families on the reasons they drop out of school, some recurring features surface that enable us to group the analyses into two main categories. The first is directly related to 'the material dimension' of education. In this case, [[financial difficulties]] are the main reason why families do not manage to keep their children and adolescents in school. The other major group of factors for school drop out falls into the 'subjective dimension' of the educational experience. Surveys revealed that 22% of out-of-school boys and girls aged 10 or 11 years state that they are in this situation because they have no interest in [[studying]]. This percentage jumps to 38% in adolescents aged 15 to 17 years who also provided this reason for their disengagement with the education system.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002475/247577E.pdf|title=Youth and changing realities: Rethinking secondary education in Latin America|last=López|first=Néstor|last2=Opertti|first2=Renato|last3=Vargas Tamez|first3=Carlos|publisher=UNESCO|year=2017|isbn=978-92-31 00204-5|location=|pages=22–24, 28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dropout recovery==
A "dropout recovery" initiative is any community, government, non-profit or business program in which students who have previously left school are sought out for the purpose of re-enrollment. In the U.S., such initiatives are often focused on former high school students who are still young enough to have their educations publicly subsidized, generally those 22 years of age and younger. In Rwanda, dropout recovery is often focused on primary and ordinary level students who are still young to have their educations.

Dropout recovery programs can be initiated in traditional "brick-and-mortar" institutions of learning, in community centers or online.

Dropping out of high school can have drastic long-term economic and social repercussions, especially in Australia which has a less equitable education system than many other western countries. Therefore, different pathways and courses of study are being implemented by the government, non for profit organizations and private companies to offer a selection of education recovery plans for young adults around the age of 22 and below.

== Attrition ==
Students that drop out of high-school are generally those that struggle to engage behaviorally and/or academically.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=22153483|pmc=3478125|year=2012|author1=Fall|first1=A.

According to data collected by the national education longitudinal study of 1988, Rumberger found that students with moderate to high absenteeism, behavior problems and having no school or outside activities were highly predictive of dropping out.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rumberger|first=Russell W.|last2=Larson|first2=Katherine A.|date=1998-11-01|title=Student Mobility and the Increased Risk of High School Dropout|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/444201|journal=American Journal of Education|volume=107|issue=1|pages=1–35|doi=10.1086/444201|issn=0195-6744}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prevention ==

=== Family dynamics ===
Under the pact of [[Inclusion (education)|educational inclusion]] at the secondary level, how families organize themselves internally to produce well-being is an unavoidable topic for countries to address when seeking to broaden the effective opportunities of access to, retention in and graduation from the secondary education. Therefore, the construction of a new policy, the adolescent and the young person at school, is an acknowledgement of what is happening in reality and shapes a mutually beneficial alliance between the state and families to generate dynamics where young people can become exclusive recipients of care – at least until completion of their secondary schooling.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Everett Dean Martin''' (July 5, 1880 – May 10, 1941) was an American minister, writer, journalist, instructor, lecturer, [[social psychologist]], [[social philosopher]], and an advocate of [[adult education]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael J. Day, "A primary source for Everett Dean Martin's agenda for adult education" http://roghiemstra.com/day.html&lt;/ref&gt;  He was an instructor and lecturer at [[The New School for Social Research]] in [[New York City]] from 1921-1929, and served on the Board of Directors of [[The New School]] from 1925-1932.&lt;ref&gt;http://digitalarchives.library.newschool.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;  He was the final Director of the [[Charles Sprague Smith|People's Institute]]&lt;ref&gt;http://socialarchive.iath.virginia.edu/ark:/99166/w6n0522b&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Cooper Union]] in [[New York City]] from 1922-1934.  Martin was born in [[Jacksonville, Illinois]] on July 5, 1880.  Graduating with honors at the age of 24 from [[Illinois College]] in Jacksonville, he moved on to Chicago, attending [[McCormick Theological Seminary]] from 1904 until his ordination as a Congregational Minister in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;Everett Dean Martin: liberal in adult education|https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/42589283.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Martin received a Litt.D (Doctor of Letters) degree from [[Illinois College]] in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;The Stanford Daily, Volume 83a, Issue 15, 15 August 1933&lt;/ref&gt;  He was best known for his advocacy of the liberal education of adults, which he saw as “an antidote to both the [[irrationality]] of the [[crowd manipulation|crowd]] and the power of [[propaganda]].”&lt;ref&gt;Rose, A.D. (1999). Everett Dean Martin. In J.A. a. C. Garraty, Mark C. (Ed.), American National Biography (Vol. 14, pp. 589-591). New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
In 1907, he married Esther W. Kirk of Jacksonville, Illinois.  They had three children: Mary, Margaret, and Elizabeth.&lt;ref&gt;Hannan, Caryn, Illinois Biographical Dictionary, 2008-2009 Edition, Volume One., State History Publications, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1906-1908, Martin was Pastor of the [[Maple Street Chapel|First Congregational Church]] (now called The First Church of Lombard) of Lombard, Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.firstchurchoflombard.org/2016/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://adulteducationcontributors.pbworks.com/w/page/54988015/58%20Everett%20Dean%20Martin&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1908-1911, Martin was Pastor of the People’s Church in Dixon, Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;http://adulteducationcontributors.pbworks.com/w/page/54988015/58%20Everett%20Dean%20Martin&lt;/ref&gt;  Martin was minister of the First [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] Church of [[Des Moines]], Iowa, 1911-1915

Martin was a featured columnist for the [[Des Moines Register]] during the years 1914-1915.&lt;ref&gt;http://roghiemstra.com/day.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1915, his successful life took a radical shift in course.  He divorced his wife of eight years and left the professional ministry.  He moved to New York and began writing for the [[New York Globe]].&lt;ref&gt;Steven B. Frye, “Everett Dean Martin: Misunderstood Champion of Adult Education,” Carson-Newman Studies, Vol. X, No 3, Fall 2004, pp. 84-98, ISSN 1081-7727.&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the next 20 years, Martin developed into a successful writer and forged a national reputation as a charismatic public lecturer, often attracting a crowd of a thousand or more at the [[Charles Sprague Smith|People's Institute]], a major center for adult education in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Day and Clifford P. Harbour, The Philosopher and the Lecturer: John Dewey, Everett Dean Martin, and Reflective Thinking., Education and Culture, Vol. 29 (1), 2013, pp.105-124.&lt;/ref&gt;  Martin's second marriage in 1915 to Persis Eastman Rowell also ended in divorce, they had one son, Everett Eastman.&lt;ref&gt;Hannan, Caryn, Illinois Biographical Dictionary, 2008-2009 Edition, Volume One., State History Publications, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Commentary on the early 20th century ==
In ''The Behavior of Crowds'' (1920), his first nationally reviewed book, he posed what he saw as the dilemma of the modern age: a technological information revolution that made it possible, in the absence of an adequate educational system, to influence ignorant men and women with [[propaganda]] and half-truths.  Unscrupulous [[demagogues]], corrupt politicians, [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] advertisers, and revolutionary [[ideologues]] found ready-made audiences when they appealed to the baser (a subconscious urge, behavior, or intuition directed by primeval, animalistic, self-serving, and/or ignoble motivations) instincts.&lt;ref&gt;Everett Dean Martin: liberal in adult education|https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/42589283.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin was a [[Classical liberalism|classical]], [[individualistic]] [[Liberalism|liberal]], in the tradition of the [[Renaissance]] [[humanists]] and the authors of [[The Federalist Papers]]. He believed in restrained government and in the self-selection of intellectually promising students through appropriate programs of adult education.

His most famous and widely read work, ''The Meaning of a Liberal Education'', appeared in 1926, the same year he helped found the American Association for Adult Education.&lt;ref&gt;Everett Dean Martin: liberal in adult education|https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/42589283.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  When his book, ''The Meaning of a Liberal Education'' was released in 1926, [[Frederick Paul Keppel]], the president of the [[Carnegie Corporation]] proclaimed it as “the most important contribution to the understanding of [[adult education]]… this far in the United States.”&lt;ref&gt;Day, M., J, &amp; Seckinger, D. (1987, May 21–23). Everett Dean Martin: Spiritual leader of the adult education movement in the United States.  Paper presented at the Adult Education Research Conference Proceedings, Laramie, Wyoming.&lt;/ref&gt;  In March 1928, [[John Dewey]] responded to a request from [[Marie Mattingly Meloney]], editor of the [[New York Herald-Tribune]] Sunday Magazine, and offered his recommendations on recently published texts on education.  [[John Dewey|Dewey]] wrote, “I think the best educational books of recent publication are…Martin, ''The Meaning of a Liberal Education''.  This was not the first time [[John Dewey|Dewey]] recommended Everett Dean Martin’s book.  In 1927, the editors of the Journal of the [[National Education Association]] approached [[John Dewey|Dewey]] and asked, “What book have you recently found especially worthwhile?  Something that you have read easily, eagerly, and with profit, either in the field of education or out of it.”  [[John Dewey|Dewey]] identified two books; one of them was Martin’s ''The Meaning of a Liberal Education''.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Day and Clifford P. Harbour, The Philosopher and the Lecturer: John Dewey, Everett Dean Martin, and Reflective Thinking., Education and Culture, Vol. 29 (1), 2013, pp.105-124.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appointments ==
From 1919-1922, Martin served as chairman of The [[National Board of Review]] of Motion Pictures.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, A.D. (1999). Everett Dean Martin. In J.A. a. C. Garraty, Mark C. (Ed.), American National Biography (Vol. 14, pp. 589-591). New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin was an instructor and lecturer at [[The New School for Social Research]] in [[New York City]] from 1921-1929, and served on the Board of Directors of [[The New School]] from 1925-1932.&lt;ref&gt;http://digitalarchives.library.newschool.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;  He taught classes in sociology, psychology, social behavior, and adult education.&lt;ref&gt;http://digitalarchives.library.newschool.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;  At [[The New School]], Martin taught alongside other prominent intellectuals of the day including, [[Alfred Adler]], [[Norman Angell]], [[Harry Elmer Barnes]], [[Charles Austin Beard]], [[Edwin Grant Conklin]], [[Herbert J. Davenport]], [[John Dewey]], [[Lawrence K. Frank]], [[Felix Frankfurter]], [[Alexander Goldenweiser (anthropologist)|Alexander Goldenweiser]], [[Joseph Jastrow]], [[Alvin Saunders Johnson]], [[Horace Kallen]], [[Alfred Kreymborg]], [[Eduard C. Lindeman]], [[Walter Lippmann]], [[Frederick Macaulay]], [[Wesley Clair Mitchell]], [[Gorham Munson]], [[Moissaye Joseph Olgin]], [[Harry Allen Overstreet]], [[James Harvey Robinson]], [[Mark Van Doren]], [[Thorstein Veblen]], and [[Leo Wolman]].&lt;ref&gt;The Survey, “The New School, A Laboratory of Social Sciences.” (Advertisement), Volume 46, August 16th, 1921.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://digitalarchives.library.newschool.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the courses Martin taught at [[The New School]] between 1921 and 1929 were: Introduction to Social Psychology, Fundamental Problems in Adult Education, The Process of Adult Learning, Psychology and the Problems of Social Behavior, Some Applications of Social Psychology, Studies on Social Behavior, and Psychological Problems of Social Reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;http://digitalarchives.library.newschool.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;  An example of Martin’s lecture topics in from a 1925 course on [[social philosophy]] taught at [[The New School]] include: The [[Psychology]] of the [[Crowd psychology|Crowd]]; The So-Called [[Collective consciousness|Group Mind]]; Has Man a Social or [[Herd behavior|”Herd”]] Instinct?; The [[Psychology]] of Mass Appeal; Leadership in the [[Crowd psychology|Crowd]]; Reform Legislation; The Present Industrial Transition.&lt;ref&gt;http://digitalarchives.library.newschool.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;

Why is this seminal individual virtually ignored amidst the ranks of the founders of the [[adult education]] movement?  Apparently Martin’s wholehearted commitment to liberal education has placed him in juxtaposition with the early proponents of practical education in the eyes of contemporary scholars.  Here is an individual virtually dismissed not only in the history of [[adult education]], but also in the contemporary exploration of [[adult education]].”&lt;ref&gt;Steven B. Frye, “Everett Dean Martin: Misunderstood Champion of Adult Education,” Carson-Newman Studies, Vol. X, No 3, Fall 2004, pp. 84-98, ISSN 1081-7727.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among those recruited to the programs of the [[Charles Sprague Smith|People's Institute]]&lt;ref&gt;http://socialarchive.iath.virginia.edu/ark:/99166/w6n0522b&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Cooper Union]] during Martin’s tenure as Director (1926-1934) had been [[Mortimer Adler]], [[Scott Buchanan]], [[Will Durant]], [[Clifton Fadiman]], and [[Hilda Worthington Smith]], all soon to surpass Martin in fame and influence.  Yet, in his heyday, Martin was regarded as one of the leading figures in [[adult education]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Everett Dean Martin: liberal in adult education|https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/42589283.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Morse A. Cartwright, who was the Executive Director of the American Association for Adult Education from its founding in 1926 to its ultimate dissolution and transformation in 1949, considered Martin to be the "spiritual father" of the association in particular and of the entire movement in general.&lt;ref&gt;Morse A. Cartwright, "Everett Dean Martin," Journal of Adult Education, 13 (1941): 324&lt;/ref&gt; Cartwright went on to say in his eulogy for Martin, published in the Journal of Adult Education, that:

“. . . Thousands who had heard him lecture in all parts of the United States, more thousands who had read his numerous books and articles on philosophical and psychological subjects, and the large audience which for years listened to his notable Friday night addresses and discussions in the Great Hall of [[Cooper Union]] in New York, all attested to the challenging qualities of his mind and heart.”&lt;ref&gt;Morse A. Cartwright, "Everett Dean Martin," Journal of Adult Education, 13 (1941): 324&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934 Martin was asked to direct the Department of Social Philosophy at the [[Cooper Union]] in [[New York City|New York]] through a $15,000 per year grant from the [[Carnegie Corporation]] through his long-time friend [[Frederick Paul Keppel]].  Martin remained in this position until 1936 when he accepted an opportunity to move to California and direct an experimental program in teaching at [[Claremont Colleges]].&lt;ref&gt;Steven B. Frye, “Everett Dean Martin: Misunderstood Champion of Adult Education,” Carson-Newman Studies, Vol. X, No 3, Fall 2004, pp. 84-98, ISSN 1081-7727.&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin was a Professor of [[Social Psychology]] at [[Scripps College]] in [[Claremont, California]] from 1936 up until his death in 1941.

== Death ==
Martin died on May 10, 1941 of a heart attack in [[Claremont, California]] at the age of 60.&lt;ref&gt;Everett Dean Martin: liberal in adult education|https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/42589283.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Martin's third wife, Daphne Crane Drake, whom he married in 1931, survived him.&lt;ref&gt;Hannan, Caryn, Illinois Biographical Dictionary, 2008-2009 Edition, Volume One., State History Publications, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Mrs. Everett Dean Martin (Daphne Crane Drake) was a former President of the Child Study Association of America (1934).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bankstreet.edu/archives/special-collections/csaa-collection/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://socialwelfare.library.vcu.edu/programs/child-welfarechild-labor/child-study-association-of-america-statement-of-purpose-1913/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://socialarchive.iath.virginia.edu/ark:/99166/w6963jbx&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Expand German|Waldpädagogik|date=June 2017}}

'''Forest school,''' is a [[outdoor education]] delivery model in which children (or adults) visit natural spaces to learn personal, social and technical skills. It has been defined as "an inspirational process that offers children, young people and adults regular opportunities to achieve and develop confidence through hands-on learning in a woodland environment".&lt;ref name="fsrs"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.forestresearch.gov.uk/pdf/SERG_Forest_School_research_summary.pdf/$FILE/SERG_Forest_School_research_summary.pdf|title=Forest School Research Summary|year=2008|publisher=Forest Research|last=O'Brien|first=Liz|last2=Murray|first2=Richard }}&lt;/ref&gt; Forest school is both a [[pedagogy]] and a physical entity, with the use often being interchanged. The plural "schools" is often used when referring to a number of groups or sessions.  There is no single definition of "forest school", and as of 2018 known attempts to commercialize the term via trademark or copyright have been unsuccessful.

Forest school uses the woods and forests as a means to build independence and [[self-esteem]] in children and young adults.Topics are cross-curriculum (broad in subject) including the natural environment, for example the role of trees in society, the complex ecosystem supported by a wilderness, and recognition of specific plants and animals. However, the personal skills are considered highly valuable, such as teamwork and problem solving.&lt;ref name="What is Forest School?"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forestschoolassociation.org/what-is-forest-school|publisher=Forest School Association|title=What is Forest School}}&lt;/ref&gt; The woodland environment may be used to learn about more abstract concepts such as mathematics and communication. Forest school provision is also called ''nature schools''.

== Activities and scope ==

In the UK Model schedules within forest schools vary, but one approach is to take school learners to woodland for once a week, with an initial 6 week observation and assessment period, where a baseline is produced for each child in terms of areas of their holistic development, with particular emphasis on their social and emotional aspects of learning (SEAL). Once the baseline assessment has been produced the Forest School Leader / Practitioner will then continue with the long term programme over the course of the learning period in order to support the child in their development and learning. The practitioner will provide opportunities for each child to develop in areas that have been identified as requiring interventions or support of any kind&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = A guide to Forest School in Wales|url = http://www.forestschoolleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/AguidetoForestSchoolsinWales.pdf|year = 2009|publisher = Forestry Commission Wales}}&lt;/ref&gt; The duration and frequency of visits influences the degree of outcome; more time spent in forest school brings greater benefits.&lt;ref name="review-outdoor"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.field-studies-council.org/documents/general/NFER/A_review_of_research_on_outdoor_learning.pdf| title=A Review of Research on Outdoor Learning| last=Rickinson| first=Mark| last2=Dillon|first2=Justin| last3=Teamey| first3=Kelly| publisher=National Foundation for Educational Research and King's College London| date=March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Visits should ideally continue throughout the year, allowing children to experience all weathers and the changing seasons.

Forest schools are for all learners, of any age, often "led by the learner`s interests" (learner initiated learning) by comparison to other [[outdoor education]] which "starts with an issue agenda or problem for the learner to investigate".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Massey|first=Sam|title=The Benefits of a Forest School Experience for Children in their Early Years|url=http://www.forestschoolleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Massey-benefits-of-forest-school-research.pdf|publisher=National Foundation for Educational Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main goals of forest school in primary  age children includes encouraging curiosity and exploration with all of the senses, empowering children in the natural environment, and encouraging spatial awareness and motor development.&lt;ref name="What is Forest School?" /&gt; Forest schools usually provide a higher adult to child ratio than some learning styles, in order to ensure children are supported sufficiently in a higher risk environment.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.forestschoolassociation.org/history-of-forest-school/&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond primary school age children, forest school is frequently used to further develop social skills and explore creative learning and focuses on developing firm foundations for continued personal and education development.  In particular it has been used as an alternative curriculum provision to support continued mainstream education involvement, or as a temporary/transitional approach back into school.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Consistent with [[attention restoration theory]], children taking part in forest school have been described as more relaxed.&lt;ref name="woodsforlearning"/&gt; Relationships between the children and each other, with adults, and with the environment, are important&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|url=http://www.greenlighttrust.org/Forest%20Schools/ARU%20Conference%20Paper%2019042007%20-%20Sara%20Bond.doc|title=Forest School: relational pedagogy in action|date=April 2007|place=Anglia Ruskin University|booktitle=Reclaiming Relational Pedagogy in Early Childhood: Learning from International Experience|last=Bond|first=Sara|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726131909/http://www.greenlighttrust.org/Forest%20Schools/ARU%20Conference%20Paper%2019042007%20-%20Sara%20Bond.doc|archivedate=2011-07-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forest school is part of the broader area of [[outdoor education]]. Outside the school curriculum, this extends to summer holiday camps, [[Scouting]], Outward Bound projects and many other activities. Before children reach school age, [[Forest kindergarten]]s provide a similar service.

Forest school is currently taking place in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, USA, Malaysia, Switzerland, Spain, Ireland, Germany and United Kingdom.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

== Supporting Children With Exceptionalities  ==

The combination of freedom and responsibility has been particularly beneficial to children who suffer from lack of confidence or whose behaviour is challenging. With high adult:child ratios, children can safely experience activities that are often prohibited, such as climbing trees or lighting fires.Children have the freedom to explore the area within the forest, this helps the child to learn to manage their own safety and move around comfortably.&lt;ref name="Knight, S 2009"&gt;Knight, S (2009) Forest schools and outdoor learning in the early years.

== History ==

=== Sweden and Denmark ===

In the 1950s the idea was created in Denmark and shortly there after in Sweden. In Denmark it became an embedded part of the curriculum for pre-school children (under seven years) stemming from their småbørnspædagogik, or 'Early childhood education'. Children attending Forest kindergartens were in most cases arriving at school with strong social skills, the ability to work in groups effectively, high self-esteem, and confidence in their own capabilities.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

In 1957, a [[Sweden|Swedish]] man, Goesta Frohm, created the "Skogsmulle" concept to promote learning about nature, water, mountains and pollution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skogsmullestiftelsen.org/eng/index.htm Skogsmulle Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt; With an increasing focus on measurable outcomes, forest schools have gained acceptance as an educational method in their own right. In Denmark, nature schools as well as [[forest kindergarten]]s are popular with both school teachers and children.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Fuks|first=Vlada|url=http://diggy.ruc.dk/bitstream/1800/334/1/Environmental_education_and.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070620232945/http://diggy.ruc.dk/bitstream/1800/334/1/Environmental_education_and.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2007-06-20|title=Environmental Education and Nature Schools in Denmark|year=2004|publisher=Roskilde University, Denmark}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[biophilia hypothesis]] argues that a love of nature is instinctive. The term [[nature deficit disorder]], coined by Richard Louv in his 2005 book ''Last Child in the Woods'', recognises the erosion of this by the urbanisation of human society. [[Attention restoration theory]] and related psychological work has proven health benefits in reduced stress, improved concentration and improved medical outcomes from surgery. Scandinavian countries, rich in woodland, have maintained the human link more closely. Forest schools practice is based on up-to date pedagogy and andragogy.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

=== United Kingdom ===
  
This ethos was introduced to the [[United Kingdom|UK]] during the 1990s from Denmark. The growth of forest school has been unprecedented throughout the UK developing into a separate and distinct model called the UK Model. [[Bridgwater College]] in Somerset was the pioneer of the forest school concept in the UK in 1994 after traveling to Denmark to observe the Danish/Nordic Model of Forest Kindergartens for a few days.&lt;ref name="Knight, S 2009"/&gt;

Various government and [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]] agencies propose the use of woodland as part of the school educational curriculum; for example the Forest Education Initiative&lt;ref name="fei"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foresteducation.org/forest_schools.php?page=1|title=What is an FEI Forest School?|publisher=Forest Education Initiative|year=2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201053814/http://www.foresteducation.org/forest_schools.php?page=1|archivedate=2010-02-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Forestry Commission]].&lt;ref name="woodsforlearning"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.forestry.gov.uk/forestry/infd-6cjdgl|title=Woods for Learning Education Strategy|year=2005|publisher=Forestry Commission Scotland|isbn=0-85538-684-3|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912012111/http://www.forestry.gov.uk/forestry/infd-6cjdgl|archivedate=2009-09-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2006, there were approximately 140 forest schools in Britain.&lt;ref name="fsrs"/&gt;

The governmental agencies have in some cases been set targets for the use of their resources for education or health benefits,&lt;ref name="woodsforlearning"/&gt; or are focused on the educational outcomes and see forestry as a step towards them.&lt;ref name="earlyyearsframework"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Doc/257007/0076309.pdf#page=31|title=Early Years Framework|publisher=Scottish Government|isbn=978-0-7559-5942-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many businesses and non-profit organizations facilitate forest school long term programmes. In [[Wales]], training and strategic oversight is provided by Forest Schools Wale] and government agencies such as the [[Forestry Commission]] who have supported research and the development of practical experience for forest school practitioners. In [[England]], support has been provided by the Forest Education Network (which has replaced the Forest Education Initiative) to those initiating forest school provision. Such provision is provided within schools using their own trained staff or by external independent forest school providers.

Many organisations now offer training courses designed for the UK to enable practitioners to deliver forest school in their own settings and ensure children and teachers work within rich natural experiences.{{cn|date=September 2018}} The OCN Level 3 training course is most widely recognised within the UK.

Developing from the Institute of Outdoor Learning's (IOL) Forest School Special Interest Group, in June 2012 The Forest School Association was established as an independent UK body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forestschoolassociation.org/history-of-forest-school/|title=History of Forest School}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canada ===
Inspired by international developments, the first Canadian forest school was created by Marlene Power in 2007. It was named Carp Ridge Preschool and was located near Ottawa.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=MacEachren|first=Zabe|date=Autumn 2013|title=The Canadian Forest School Movement|url=http://www.learninglandscapes.ca/index.php/learnland/issue/view/33/Vol%207%20No%201%20%282013%29%3A%20Early%20Childhood%20Education%3A%20Successes%20and%20Challenges|journal=LEARNing Landscapes|volume=7|pages=219–233|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Power founded and became the executive director of Forest School Canada, an educational initiative of the Child and Nature Alliance of Canada.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Forest and Nature School in Canada|last=|first=|publisher=Forest School Canada|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=1–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forest School Canada is focused on being a "network for support, education, and accreditation for concepts associated with the FS movement in Canada."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The movement has spread into Canada's provinces and is primary associated with private schools.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, there is emerging support from public schools such as the Nature Kindergarten pilot which is a partnership between the Sooke District School Board and the University of Victoria’s Centre for Early Childhood Research and Policy, Royal Roads University, and Camosun College’s Early Learning and Care Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://naturekindergarten.sd62.bc.ca/proposal/|title=Proposal for a Nature Kindergarten {{!}} Nature Kindergarten|website=naturekindergarten.sd62.bc.ca|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use of Terminology ==
Attempts have been made to [[copyright]] and [[trademark]] generic terms related to forest school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trade marking terms that are generic within the Forest School sector|url=http://www.forestschoolassociation.org/trade-marking-terms-that-are-generic-within-the-forest-school-sector/|accessdate=16 May 2014|author=Forest School Association|date=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no known protection of the term "forest school" or "forest schools".

'''Formative assessment''', including ''diagnostic testing'', is a range of formal and informal assessment procedures conducted by teachers during the learning process in order to modify teaching and learning activities to improve student attainment.&lt;ref name="crooks2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crooks,|first=T.|title=The Validity of Formative Assessments|year=2001|url=http://www.leeds.ac.uk/educol/documents/00001862.htm|at=British Educational Research Association Annual Conference, University of Leeds, September 13–15, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; It typically involves qualitative feedback (rather than scores) for both student and teacher that focuses on the details of content and performance.&lt;ref name="Huhta 2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Huhta|first=Ari|title=The Handbook of Educational Linguistics|year=2010|publisher=Blackwell|location=Oxford, UK|pages=469–482|editor=Spolsky, Bernard |editor2=Hult, Francis M.|chapter=Diagnostic and Formative Assessment}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is commonly contrasted with [[summative assessment]], which seeks to monitor educational outcomes, often for purposes of external accountability.&lt;ref name="Shepard 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shepard|first=Lorrie A.|title=Formative assessment: Caveat emptor|year=2005|url=http://www.cpre.org/ccii/images/stories/ccii_pdfs/shepard%20formative%20assessment%20caveat%20emptor.pdf|accessdate=25 August 2011|at=ETS Invitational Conference ''The Future of Assessment: Shaping Teaching and Learning'', New York, October 10–11, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==

Practice in a classroom is formative to the extent that evidence about student achievement is elicited, interpreted, and used by teachers, learners, or their peers, to make decisions about the next steps in instruction that are likely to be better, or better founded, than the decisions they would have taken in the absence of the evidence that was elicited.&lt;ref name="BlackWiliam2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Black|first1=Paul|last2=Wiliam|first2=Dylan|title=Developing the theory of formative assessment|journal=Educational Assessment, Evaluation and Accountability|date=2009|volume=21|issue=1|pages=5–31|doi=10.1007/s11092-008-9068-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of the term==

Michael Scriven coined the terms formative and [[Summative assessment|summative evaluation]] in 1967, and emphasized their differences both in terms of the goals of the information they seek and how the information is used.&lt;ref name="Scriven 1967"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Scriven|first=Michael|year=1967|chapter=The methodology of evaluation|editor=Stake, R. E.|title=Curriculum evaluation|at=American Educational Research Association (monograph series on evaluation, no. 1|publisher=Rand McNally|place=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Scriven, formative evaluation gathered information to assess the effectiveness of a curriculum and guide school system choices as to which curriculum to adopt and how to improve it.&lt;ref name="Wiliam 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Formative assessment: getting the focus right|first=Dylan|last=Wiliam|journal=Educational Assessment|year=2006|volume=11|pages=283–289|doi=10.1080/10627197.2006.9652993}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benjamin Bloom]] took up the term in 1968 in the book ''Learning for Mastery'' to consider formative assessment as a tool for improving the teaching-learning process for students.&lt;ref name="Bloom 1968"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Bloom|first=Benjamin S.|year=1968|title=Learning for mastery|publisher=University of California press|place=Los Angeles, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; His subsequent 1971 book ''Handbook of Formative and Summative Evaluation'', written with Thomas Hasting and George Madaus, showed how formative assessments could be linked to instructional units in a variety of content areas.&lt;ref name="BloomHastMad 1971"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bloom,|first=Benjamin S.|title=Handbook of formative and summative evaluation of student learning|year=1971|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York, USA |author2=Hasting, Thomas |author3=Madaus, George}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is this approach that reflects the generally accepted meaning of the term today.&lt;ref name=BlackWiliam2003&gt;{{cite journal|last=Black|first=Paul|author2=Wiliam, Dylan|title='In praise of educational research': formative assessment|journal=British Educational Research Journal|year=2003|volume=29|issue=5|pages=623–637|doi=10.1080/0141192032000133721}}&lt;/ref&gt; For both Scriven and Bloom, an assessment, whatever its other uses, is only formative if it is used to alter
subsequent educational decisions.&lt;ref name="Wiliam 2006"/&gt; Subsequently, however, Black and Wiliam have suggested this definition is too restrictive, since formative assessments may be used to provide evidence that the intended course of action was indeed appropriate. They propose that:

Practice in a classroom is formative to the extent that evidence about student achievement is elicited, interpreted, and used by teachers, learners, or their peers, to make decisions about the next steps in instruction that are likely to be better, or better founded, than the decisions they would have taken in the absence of the evidence that was elicited.&lt;ref name="BlackWiliam2009" /&gt;

== Versus summative assessment ==
The type of assessment that people may be more familiar with is [[summative assessment]]. The table below&lt;ref&gt;R. Pr ́egent, Charting your course: How to prepare to teach more effectively, Atwood, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; shows some basic differences between the two types of assessment.

==Rationale and practice==
Formative assessment serves several purposes:
* to provide feedback for teachers to modify subsequent learning activities and experiences;&lt;ref name="Huhta 2010" /&gt;
* to identify and remediate group or individual deficiencies;&lt;ref name="Huhta 2010" /&gt;
* to move focus away from achieving grades and onto learning processes, in order to increase [[self efficacy]] and reduce the negative impact of [[extrinsic motivation]];&lt;ref name="Shepard 2005" /&gt;
* to improve students' [[metacognition|metacognitive]] awareness of how they learn.&lt;ref name="Shepard 2005" /&gt;
* "frequent, ongoing assessment allows both for fine-tuning of instruction and student focus on progress."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cauley|first=K, M.|author2=McMillan, J. H.|title=Formative Assessment Techniques|journal=The Clearing House|year=2010|volume=83|issue=1|url-access=subscription|via=Proquest|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/848217350?accountid=28680}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Characteristics of formative assessment:

According to Harlen and James (1997), formative assessment:
* is essentially positive in intent, in that it is directed towards promoting learning; it is therefore part of teaching;
* it takes into account the progress of each individual, the effort put in and other aspects of learning which may be unspecified in the curriculum; in other words, it is not purely criterion-referenced;
* it has to take into account several instances in which certain skills and ideas are used and there will be inconsistencies as well as patterns in behaviour; such inconsistencies would be 'error' in summative evaluation, but in formative evaluation they provide diagnostic information;
* validity and usefulness are paramount in formative assessment and should take precedence over concerns for reliability;
* even more than assessment for other purposes, formative assessment requires that pupils have a central part in it; pupils have to be active in their own learning (teachers cannot learn for them) and unless they come to understand their strengths and weaknesses, and how they might deal with them, they will not make progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harlen|first1=Wynne|last2=James|first2=Mary|title=Assessment and Learning: differences and relationships between formative and summative assessment|journal=Assessment in Education: Principles, Policy &amp; Practice|date=1997|volume=4|issue=3|pages=365–379|doi=10.1080/0969594970040304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feedback is the central function of formative assessment. It typically involves a focus on the detailed content of what is being learnt,&lt;ref name="Huhta 2010" /&gt; rather than simply a test score or other measurement of how far a student is falling short of the expected standard.&lt;ref name="Nicolmacfarlane 2005"&gt;{{cite book|last = Nicol|first = David|title = Rethinking Formative Assessment in HE: a theoretical model and seven principles of good feedback practice|year = 2005|publisher = Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education|author2 = Macfarlane-Dick, Debra}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicol and Macfarlane-Dick, synthesising from the literature, list seven principles of good feedback practice:
# It clarifies what good performance is (goals, criteria, expected standards);
# It facilitates the development of self-assessment in learning;
# It provides high quality information to students about their learning;
# It encourages teacher and peer dialogue around learning;
# It encourages positive motivational beliefs and self-esteem;
# It provides opportunities to close the gap between current and desired performance;
# It provides information to teachers that can be used to help shape teaching.&lt;ref name="Nicolmacfarlane 2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NicolMacfarlane 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nicol|first=David J.|author2=Macfarlane-Dick, Debra|title=Formative assessment and self-regulated learning: a model and seven principles of good practice|journal=Studies in Higher Education|year=2006|volume=31|issue=2|pages=199–218|doi=10.1080/03075070600572090}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
The time between formative assessment and adjustments to learning can be a matter of seconds or a matter of months.&lt;ref name="Wiliam 2006"/&gt; Some examples of formative assessment are:
* A language teacher asks students to choose the best [[thesis statement]] from a selection; if all choose correctly she moves on; if only some do she may initiate a class discussion; if most answer incorrectly then she may review the work on thesis statements.&lt;ref name="Wiliam 2006"/&gt;
* A teacher asks her students to write down, in a brainstorm activity, all they know about how hot-air balloons work so that she can discover what students already know about the area of science she is intending to teach.&lt;ref name="Cowie Bell 1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last = Cowie|first = Bronwen|author2 = Bell, Beverley|year = 1999|title = A model of formative assessment in science education|journal = Assessment in Education|volume = 6|pages = 101–116|doi = 10.1080/09695949993026}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A science supervisor looks at the previous year's student test results to help plan teacher workshops during the summer vacation, to address areas of weakness in student performance.&lt;ref name="Wiliam 2006"/&gt;
* A teacher documents student work and student conferences to help plan authentic activities to meet student needs&lt;ref&gt;Buldu 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
* Students could be given each one of three "traffic cards" to indicate the level at which they are understanding a concept during a lesson. Green means that the student is understanding the concept and the teacher can move on, yellow indicates that the instructor should slow down because the student is only somewhat understanding the concept, and red indicates that the student wishes that the teacher stops and explains a specific concept more clearly because they are not understanding it.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;ORDER, IN. "Five "Key Strategies" for Effective Formative Assessment." (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evidence==
[[Meta-analysis]] of studies into formative assessment have indicated significant learning gains where formative assessment is used, across all content areas, knowledge and skill types, and levels of education.&lt;ref name=BlackWiliam1998a&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Black|first1=Paul|last2=Wiliam|first2=Dylan|title=Assessment and Classroom Learning|journal=Assessment in Education: Principles, Policy &amp; Practice|date=1998|volume=5|issue=1|pages=7–74|doi=10.1080/0969595980050102}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Educational researcher [[Robert J. Marzano]] states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Recall the finding from Black and [[Dylan Wiliam|Wiliam]]'s (1998) synthesis of more than 250 studies that formative assessments, as opposed to summative ones, produce the more powerful effect on student learning. In his review of the research, Terrance Crooks (1988) reports that effects sizes for summative assessments are consistently lower than effect sizes for formative assessments. In short, it is formative assessment that has a strong research base supporting its impact on learning.&lt;ref name="Marzano, R. J. 2006"&gt;Marzano, R. J. (2006). Classroom assessments and grading that work. Alexandria, VA: Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|9}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While empirical evidence has shown the substantial impact formative assessment has in raising student achievement,&lt;ref name=BlackWiliam1998a /&gt; it is also "recognized as one of the most powerful ways to enhance student motivation".&lt;ref name=CauleyMcMillan2010&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cauley|first=Kathleen|author2=McMillan, James|title=Formative assessment techniques to support student motivation and achievement|journal=The Clearing House: A Journal of Educational Strategies, Issues and Ideas|year=2010|volume=83|issue=1pages=1–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Believing in their ability to learn, contributing learning successes to individual efforts and abilities, emphasizing progress toward learning goals rather than letter grades, and evaluating "the nature of their thinking to identify strategies that improve understanding"&lt;ref name=McMillanHearn&gt;{{cite journal|last=McMillan|first=James|author2=Hearn, Jessica|title=Student Self-assessment: The Key to Stronger Student Motivation and Higher Achievement|journal=Educational Horizons|year=2008|volume=87|issue=1|pages=40–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; are all manners in which motivation is enhanced through an effective use of formative assessment.&lt;ref name="CauleyMcMillan2010"/&gt;  However, for these gains to become evident formative assessment must (1) Clarify and share learning goals and success criteria; (2) Create effective classroom discussions and other tasks which demonstrate evidence of student understanding; (3) provide feedback which can and will be acted upon; (4) allow students to become instructional resources for one another; and (5) stimulate students to become owners of their own learning.&lt;ref name=WiliamThompson2007&gt;{{cite book|last=Wiliam|first=Dylan|author2=Thompson, M|chapter=Integrating Assessment with Instruction: What will it take to make it work? |editor= C. A. Dwyer |title= The Future of Assessment: Shaping Teaching and Learning|publisher= Routledge|year=2008|pages=53–82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers have concluded that standards-based assessments may be an effective way to "prescribe instruction and to ensure that no child is left behind".&lt;ref name="Marzano, R. J. 2006"/&gt;{{rp|13}}

The strongest evidence of improved learning gains comes from short-cycle (over seconds or minutes within a single lesson) formative assessment, and medium to long-term assessment where assessment is used to change the teacher's regular classroom practice.&lt;ref name="Wiliam 2006"/&gt;

== Strategies ==

=== Understanding goals for learning ===
It is important for students to understand the goals and the criteria for success when learning in the classroom. Often teachers will introduce learning goals to their students before a lesson, but will not do an effective job in distinguishing between the end goals and what the students will be doing to achieve those goals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; "When teachers start from what it is they want students to know and design their instruction backward from that goal, then instruction is far more likely to be effective".&lt;ref&gt;Wiggins, Grant, and Jay McTighe. Understanding by Design. New York: Prentice Hall, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; In a study done by Gray and Tall,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gray|first1=Eddie M.|last2=Tall|first2=David O.|title=Duality, Ambiguity, and Flexibility: A 'Proceptual' View of Simple Arithmetic|journal=Journal for Research in Mathematics Education|date=1994|volume=25|issue=2|pages=116|doi=10.2307/749505}}&lt;/ref&gt; they found that 72 students between the ages of 7 and 13 had different experiences when learning in mathematics. The study showed that higher achieving students looked over mathematical ambiguities, while the lower achieving students tended to get stuck on these misunderstandings. An example of this&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; can be seen in the number &lt;math&gt;6\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;. Although it is not explicitly stated, the operation between these two numbers is addition. If we look at the number &lt;math&gt;6x&lt;/math&gt;, here the implied operation between &lt;math&gt;6&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is multiplication. Finally if we take a look at the number &lt;math&gt;61&lt;/math&gt;, there is a completely different operation between the 6 and 1. The study showed that higher achieving students were able to look past this while other students were not.

Another study done by White and Frederiksen&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=White|first1=Barbara Y.|last2=Frederiksen|first2=John R.|title=Inquiry, Modeling, and Metacognition: Making Science Accessible to All Students|journal=Cognition and Instruction|date=1998|volume=16|issue=1|pages=3–118|doi=10.1207/s1532690xci1601_2}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that when twelve 7th grade science classrooms were given time to reflect on what they deemed to be quality work, and how they thought they would be evaluated on their work, the gap between the high achieving students and the low achieving students was decreased.

One way to help with this is to offer students different examples of other students' work so they can evaluate the different pieces. By examining the different levels of work, students can start to differentiate between superior and inferior work.

=== Feedback ===
There has been extensive research done on studying how students are affected by feedback. Kluger and DeNisi (1996)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kluger|first1=Avraham N.|last2=DeNisi|first2=Angelo|title=The effects of feedback interventions on performance: A historical review, a meta-analysis, and a preliminary feedback intervention theory.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=1996|volume=119|issue=2|pages=254–284|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.119.2.254}}&lt;/ref&gt; reviewed over three thousand reports on feedback in schools, universities, and the workplace. Of these, only 131 of them were found to be scientifically rigorous and of those, 50 of the studies shows that feedback actually has negative effects on its recipients. This is due to the fact that feedback is often "ego-involving",&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; that is the feedback focuses on the individual student rather than the quality of the student's work. Feedback is often given in the form of some numerical or letter grade and that perpetuates students being compared to their peers. The studies previously mentioned showed that the most effective feedback for students is when they are not only told in which areas they need to improve, but also how to go about improving it.

It has been shown that leaving comments alongside grades is just as ineffective as giving solely a numerical/letter grade (Butler 1987, 1989).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Butler|first1=Ruth|title=Task-involving and ego-involving properties of evaluation: Effects of different feedback conditions on motivational perceptions, interest, and performance.|journal=Journal of Educational Psychology|date=1987|volume=79|issue=4|pages=474–482|doi=10.1037/0022-0663.79.4.474}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to the fact that students tend to look at their grade and disregard any comments that are given to them. The next thing students tend to do is to ask other students in the class for their grade, and they compare the grade to their own grade.

=== Questioning ===
Questioning is an important part of the learning process and an even more important part is asking the right types of questions. Questions that promote discussion and student reflection make it easier for students to go on the right path to end up completing their learning goals. Here are some types of questions that are good to ask students:
* What do you think of [student]'s answer?
* What can we add to [student]'s explanation?
* [Student] said this and [student] said that, but how can we combine these explanations into a complete answer?

==== Wait time ====
Wait time is the amount of time that is given to a student to answer a question that was posed and the time allowed for the student to answer. [[Mary Budd Rowe]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Row|first1=Mary Budd|title=Wait-time and rewards as instructional variables, their influence on language, logic, and fate control: Part one-wait-time|journal=Journal of Research in Science Teaching|date=1974|volume=11|issue=2|pages=81–94|doi=10.1002/tea.3660110202}}&lt;/ref&gt; went on to look at the outcomes of having longer wait times for students. These included:
* answers were longer;
* failure to respond decreased;
* responses from students were more confident;
* students challenged and/or improved the answers of other students;
* more alternative explanations were offered.

== Peer-assessment ==
Having students assess each other's work has been studied to have numerous benefits:&lt;ref&gt;P. Black and D. Wiliam, Inside the black box: Raising standards through classroom assessment, Depart-

ment of education &amp; professional studies, GL Assessment, 2006.
&lt;/ref&gt;
* When students know that they are going to be assessed by their peers, they tend to put more attention to detail in their work.
* Students are able to speak to one another in a language that they are more comfortable with than they would be with an instructor. The insight of a fellow student might be more relatable than that of a teacher. 
* Students tend to accept constructive criticism more from a fellow student than from an instructor. 
* While students are in the process of peer-assessment, a teacher can more easily take command of the learning going on. The teacher can also stand on the sidelines and watch as the students continue to assess each other's work and may intervene at any time if need be.

== In K–12 ==
Formative assessment is valuable for day-to-day teaching when used to adapt instructional methods to meet students' needs and for monitoring student progress toward learning goals. Further, it helps students monitor their own progress as they get [[Feedback#In education|feedback]] from the teacher and/or peers, allowing the opportunity to revise and refine their thinking. Formative assessment is also known as educative assessment, classroom assessment, or assessment for learning.

===Methods===
There are many ways to integrate formative assessment into [[K–12]] classrooms. Although the key concepts of formative assessment such as constant feedback, modifying the instruction, and information about students' progress do not vary among different disciplines or levels, the methods or strategies may differ. For example, researchers developed generative activities (Stroup et al., 2004)&lt;ref&gt;Stroup, W. M., Ares, N., &amp; Hurford, A. C. (2004). A taxonomy of generative activity design supported by next generation classroom networks. Paper presented at the Proceedings of the twenty-sixth annual meeting of the North American Chapter of the International Group for the Psychology of Mathematics Education, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.&lt;/ref&gt; and model-eliciting activities (Lesh et al., 2000)&lt;ref&gt;Lesh, R., Hoover, M., Hole, B., Kelly, E., &amp; Post, T. (2000). Principles for developing thought-revealing activities for students and teachers. In A. E. Kelly &amp; R. A. Lesh (Eds.), Handbook of research design in mathematics and science education (pp. 591-645). Mahaway, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; that can be used as formative assessment tools in mathematics and science classrooms. Others developed strategies [[computer-supported collaborative learning]] environments (Wang et al., 2004b).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=Tzu-Hua|title=What strategies are effective for formative assessment in an e-learning environment?|journal=Journal of Computer Assisted Learning|date=2007|volume=23|issue=3|pages=171–186|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2729.2006.00211.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; More information about implication of formative assessment in specific areas is given below.

===Purpose===
Formative assessment, or ''diagnostic testing'' as the National Board of Professional Teaching Standards argues, serves to create effective teaching curricula and classroom-specific evaluations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nbpts.org/help_and_faqs/assessment&lt;/ref&gt; By focusing on student-centered activities, a student is able to relate the material to his life and experiences. Students are encouraged to [[Critical thinking|think critically]] and to develop analytical skills. This type of testing allows for a teacher's lesson plan to be clear, creative, and reflective of the curriculum (T.P Scot et al., 2009).&lt;ref name="Scot, Tammy Pandina 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pandina Scot|first1=Tammy|last2=Callahan|first2=Carolyn M.|last3=Urquhart|first3=Jill|title=Paint-by-Number Teachers and Cookie-Cutter Students: The Unintended Effects of High-Stakes Testing on the Education of Gifted Students|journal=Roeper Review|date=2009|volume=31|issue=1|pages=40–52|doi=10.1080/02783190802527364}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the Appalachian Education Laboratory (AEL), "diagnostic testing" emphasizes effective teaching practices while "considering learners' experiences and their unique conceptions" (T.P Scot et al., 2009).&lt;ref name="Scot, Tammy Pandina 2009" /&gt; Furthermore, it provides the framework for "efficient retrieval and application"(T.P Scot et al., 2009).&lt;ref name="Scot, Tammy Pandina 2009"/&gt; by urging students to take charge of their education. The implications of this type of testing,is developing a knowledgeable student with deep understanding of the information and then be able to account for a students' comprehension on a subject.

==Specific applications==
The following are examples of application of formative assessment to content areas:

===In math education===
In math education, it is important for teachers to see how their students approach the problems and how much mathematical knowledge and at what level students use when solving the problems. That is, knowing how students think in the process of learning or problem solving makes it possible for teachers to help their students overcome conceptual difficulties and, in turn, improve learning. In that sense, formative assessment is diagnostic. To employ formative assessment in the classrooms, a teacher has to make sure that each student participates in the learning process by expressing their ideas; there is a trustful environment in which students can provide each other with [[Feedback#In education|feedback]]; s/he (the teacher) provides students with feedback; and the instruction is modified according to students' needs. In math classes, thought revealing activities such as model-eliciting activities (MEAs) and generative activities provide good opportunities for covering these aspects of formative assessment.

==== Feedback examples ====
Here are some examples of possible feedback for students in math education:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Student: "I just don't get it."  Teacher: "Well, the first part is just like the last problem you did. Then we add one more variable. See if you can find out what it is, and I'll come back in a few minutes."
* "There are 5 answers here that are incorrect. Try to find them and fix them."
* "The answer to this question is... Can you find a way to work it out?"
* "You've used substitution to solve all of these systems of equations. Can you use elimination now to solve them?"
Different approaches for feedback encourage pupils to reflect:&lt;ref&gt;Hodgen, Jeremy, and Dylan Wiliam. Mathematics inside the Black Box: Assessment for Learning in the Mathematics Classroom. London: NFER-Nelson, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
* "You used two different methods to solve these problems. Can you explain the advantages and disadvantages of each method?"
* "You seem to have a good understanding of... Can you make up your own more difficult problem?"
Another method has students looking to each other to gain knowledge.
* "You seem to be confusing sine and cosine. Talk to Katie about the differences with the two."
* "Compare your work with Ali and write some advice to another student tackling this topic for the first time."

===In second/foreign language education===

As an ongoing assessment it focuses on the process, it helps teachers to check the current status of their students' language ability, that is, they can know what the students know and what the students do not know. It also gives chances to students to participate in modifying or planning the upcoming classes (Bachman &amp; Palmer, 1996).&lt;ref&gt;Bachman. L.F. &amp; Palmer A.S. (1996). ''Language Testing in Practice''. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Participation in their learning grows students' [[motivation]] to learn the [[Second language|target language]]. It also raises students' [[awareness]] on their target languages, which results in resetting their own goals. In consequence, it helps students to achieve their goals successfully as well as teachers be the [[facilitator]]s to foster students' target language ability.

In classroom, short quizzes, reflectionals journals, or portfolios could be used as a formative assessment (Cohen, 1994).&lt;ref&gt;Cohen. A. (1994). Assessing Language Ability in the Classroom. Heinle &amp; Heinle Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In elementary education===

In primary schools, it is used to inform the next steps of learning. Teachers and students both use formative assessments as a tool to make decisions based on data. Formative assessment occurs when teachers feed information back to students in ways that enable the student to learn better, or when students can engage in a similar, self-reflective process. The evidence shows that high quality formative assessment does have a powerful impact on student learning. Black and Wiliam (1998) report that studies of formative assessment show an effect size on [[Standardized testing and public policy|standardized tests]] of between 0.4 and 0.7, larger than most known [[Response to intervention|educational interventions]]. (The effect size is the ratio of the average improvement in test scores in the innovation to the range of scores of typical groups of pupils on the same tests; Black and Wiliam recognize that standardized tests are very limited measures of learning.) Formative assessment is particularly effective for students who have not done well in school, thus narrowing [[Achievement gap|the gap]] between low and high achievers while raising overall achievement. Research examined by Black and Wiliam supports the conclusion that summative assessments tend to have a negative effect on student learning.

===Activities that can be used as assessment tools in math and science classrooms===

====Model-eliciting activities (MEAs)====

Model-eliciting activities are based on real-life situations where students, working in small groups, present a [[mathematical model]] as a solution to a client's need (Zawojewski &amp; Carmona, 2001).&lt;ref&gt;Zawojewski, J., &amp; Carmona, G. (2001). A developmental and social perspective on problem solving strategies. In R. Speiser &amp; C. Walter (Eds.), Proceedings of the twenty-third annual meeting of the North American chapter of the international group for the psychology of mathematics education. Columbus, OH: ERIC Clearinghouse for Science, Mathematics, and Environmental Education.&lt;/ref&gt; The problem design enables students to evaluate their solutions according to the needs of a client identified in the problem situation and sustain themselves in productive, progressively effective cycles of conceptualizing and [[problem solving]]. Model-eliciting activities (MEAs) are ideally structured to help students build their real-world sense of problem solving towards increasingly powerful mathematical constructs. What is especially useful for mathematics educators and researchers is the capacity of MEAs to make students' thinking visible through their [[mathematical model|model]]s and modeling cycles. Teachers do not prompt the use of particular mathematical concepts or their representational counterparts when presenting the problems. Instead, they choose activities that maximize the potential for students to develop the concepts that are the focal point in the curriculum by building on their early and intuitive ideas. The mathematical models emerge from the students' interactions with the problem situation and learning is assessed via these emergent behaviors.

====Generative activities====

In a generative activity, students are asked to come up with outcomes that are mathematically same. Students can arrive at the responses or build responses from this sameness in a wide range of ways. The sameness gives coherence to the task and allows it to be an "organizational unit for performing a specific function." (Stroup et al., 2004)

Other activities can also be used as the means of formative assessment as long as they ensure the participation of every student, make students' thoughts visible to each other and to the teacher, promote feedback to revise and refine thinking. In addition, as a complementary to all of these is to modify and adapt instruction through the information gathered by those activities.

===In computer-supported learning===

Many academics are seeking to diversify assessment tasks, broaden the range of skills assessed and provide students with more timely and informative feedback on their progress. Others are wishing to meet student expectations for more flexible delivery and to generate efficiencies in assessment that can ease academic staff workloads. The move to [[Online assessment|on-line]] and [[Computer-based testing|computer based assessment]] is a natural outcome of the increasing use of [[information and communication technologies]] to enhance learning. As more students seek flexibility in their courses, it seems inevitable there will be growing expectations for flexible assessment as well. When implementing online and computer-based instruction, it is recommended that a structured [[Eight Dimensional E-Learning Framework|framework]] or model be used to guide the assessment.

== In UK education ==

In the [[Education in the UK|UK education system]], formative assessment (or assessment for learning) has been a key aspect of the agenda for personalised learning. The [[Working Group for 14-19 Reform|Working Group on 14–19 Reform]] led by [[Mike Tomlinson|Sir Mike Tomlinson]], recommended that assessment of learners be refocused to be more teacher-led and less reliant on external assessment, putting learners at the heart of the assessment process.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Dr Cheryl A, Assessment for Learning, Learning and Skills Development Agency (now the Learning and Skills Network) (2005), p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK government has stated&lt;ref&gt;A national conversation about personalised learning – a summary of the DfES discussion pamphlet, Department for Education and Skills (2005), p.8&lt;/ref&gt; that personalised learning depends on teachers knowing the strengths and weaknesses of individual learners, and that a key means of achieving this is through formative assessment, involving high quality feedback to learners included within every teaching session.&lt;ref&gt;Duckett, Ian and Brooke, Di, Learning and Skills Network (2007), p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

The Assessment Reform Group has set out the following 10 principles for formative assessment.&lt;ref&gt;Assessment for Learning: 10 research-based principles to guide classroom practice, Assessment Reform Group (2002), p.2&lt;/ref&gt;

Learning should:

* be part of effective planning of teaching and learning
* focus on how students learning attitude
* be recognised as central to classroom practice
* be regarded as a key professional skill for teachers
* be sensitive and constructive because any assessment has an emotional impact
* take account of the importance of learner motivation
* promote commitment to learning goals and a shared understanding of the criteria by which they are assessed
* enable learners to receive constructive guidance about how to improve
* develop learners' capacity for self-assessment so that they can become reflective and self-managing
* recognise the full range of achievements of all learners

== Benefits for teachers (Boston, 2002) ==
* Teachers are able to determine what standards students already know and to what degree.
* Teachers can decide what minor modifications or major changes in instruction they need to make so that all students can succeed in upcoming instruction and on subsequent assessments.
* Teachers can create appropriate lessons and activities for groups of learners or individual students.
* Teachers can inform students about their current progress in order to help them set goals for improvement.&lt;ref&gt;Boston, Carol (2002). The concept of formative assessment. Practical Assessment, Research &amp; Evaluation, 8(9).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Benefits for students ==
* Students are more motivated to learn.
* Students take responsibility for their own learning.
* Students can become users of assessment alongside the teacher.
* Students learn valuable lifelong skills such as self-evaluation, self-assessment, and goal setting.
* Students become more adept at self-assessment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cooper|first1=Beverley|last2=Cowie|first2=Bronwen|title=Collaborative research for assessment for learning|journal=Teaching and Teacher Education|date=2010|volume=26|issue=4|pages=979–986|doi=10.1016/j.tate.2009.10.040}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marzano, Robert J. (2003). What works in schools: Translating research into action. Alexandria, VA: ASCD.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stiggins, R.J., Arter, J.A., Chappius, J. &amp; Chappius, S. (2006). Classroom assessment for student learning: Doing it right-using it well. Portland, OR: Educational Testing Service.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Common formative assessments ==
The practice of common formative assessments is a way for teachers to use assessments to beneficially adjust their teaching pedagogy. The concept is that teachers who teach a common class can provide their classes with a common assessment. The results of that assessment could provide the teachers with valuable information, the most important being who on that teacher team is seeing the most success with his or her students on a given topic or standard. It is essential to note that the purpose of this practice is to provide feedback for teachers, not necessarily students, so an assignment could be considered formative for teachers, but summative for students. Researchers Kim Bailey and Chris Jakicic have stated that common formative assessments "Promote efficiency for teachers, promote equity for students, provide an effective strategy for determining whether the guaranteed curriculum is being taught and, more importantly, learned, inform the practice of individual teachers, build a team's capacity to improve its program, facilitate a systematic, collective response to students who are experiencing difficulty, [and] offer the most powerful tool for changing adult behavior and practice."&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Common Formative Assessment: A Toolkit for Professional Learning Communities at Work|last=Bailey|first=K.|last2=Jakicic|first2=C.|publisher=Solution Tree Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=Bloomington, IN|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Developing common formative assessments on a teacher team helps educators to address what Bailey and Jakicic lay out as the important questions to answer when reflecting on student progress.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; These include:

* What do we want students to know and do?
* How do we know they are learning?
* What do we do when they're not learning?
* How do we respond when they've already learned the information?

Common formative assessments are a way to address the second question. Teachers can collect data on how students are doing to gain understanding and insight on whether students are learning, and how they are making sense of the lessons being taught. After gathering this data, teachers can proceed to develop systems and plans to address the third and fourth questions and, over several years, modify the first question to fit the learning needs of their specific students.

When utilizing common formative assessments to collect data on student progress, teachers can compare their students' results. In tandem, they can also share the strategies they used in the classroom to teach that particular concept. With these things in mind, the teacher team can make some evaluations on what tasks and explanations seemed to produce the best student outcomes. Teachers who used alternate strategies now have new ideas for interventions and for when they teach the topic in upcoming years. Teacher teams can also use common formative assessments to review and calibrate their scoring practices. Teachers of a common class should aim to be as consistent as possible in evaluating their students. Comparing formative assessments, or having all teachers evaluate them together, is a way for teachers to adjust their grading criteria before the summative assessment. Through this practice, teachers are presented with an opportunity to grow professionally with the people who know them and understand their school environment.

To make the practice of teacher teams, common formative assessments, and power standards the most advantageous, the practice of backwards design should be utilized. Backwards design is the idea in education that the summative assessment should be developed first and that all formative work and lessons leading up to that specific assessment should be created second. Tomlinson and McTighe wrote, “Although not a new idea, we have found that the deliberate use of backwards design for planning courses, units, and individual lessons results in more clearly defined goals, more appropriate assessments, and more purposeful teaching."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Integrating Differentiated Instruction and Understanding By Design|last=Tomlinson|first=C.A.|last2=McTighe|first2=J.|publisher=ASCD|year=2006|isbn=|location=Alexandria, VA|pages=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, intervention and re-teaching time must be factored into the schedule. It is unrealistic to think that every student will get every topic perfect and ready to take the summative assessment on a prescribed schedule.

The '''Fronimo Dialogo di Vincentio Galilei''' ([[Vincenzo Galilei]]) is an instructional book on playing, composing and intabulating vocal music for the [[lute]].

The first edition was printed by [[Girolamo Scotto]] in [[Venice]] with the full title ''FRONIMO DIALOGO / DI VINCENTIO GALILEI FIORENTINO, / NEL QUALE SI CONTENGONO LE VERE, / et necessarie regole del Intavolare la Musica nel Liuto''. While the title page bears the date 1568, the final page confusingly bears the date 1569. Apparently, although the manuscript was completed by Galilei in the Autumn of 1568, the official letter of privilege allowing the publication of the book was received only in December, and the printing actually took place in 1569. In addition, still in 1569, Girolamo Scotto broke the book into two parts, selling a collection of 30 musical selections from near the end of the book and the Dialogo separately. A second edition of the complete Dialogo, with significant revisions, was printed in 1584 by the “heir of Girolamo Scotto,” under the title ''FRONIMO / DIALOGO / DI VINCENTIO GALILEI / NOBILE FIORENTINO, / SOPRA L'ARTE DEL BENE INTAVOLARE, / ET RETTAMENTE SONARE LA MUSICA / Negli strumenti artificiali si di corde come di fiato, &amp; in particulare nel Liuto''.

Unlike other lute instruction manuals of the 16th century, each of the editions of Fronimo contains quite a large amount of music. Galilei provided examples in order to illustrate how he believed compositions should be structured and how intabulations should be made from existing compositions. The examples range from a few notes or measures in length up to complete compositions in either mensural notation or lute tablature. In the 1584 edition, for example, there are 48 pieces in tablature form sprinkled throughout the text (including a set of 24 ricercars in all the possible tonalities) and a collection of 60 more pieces placed all together at the end. The 1568 edition includes a total of 96 complete pieces, many of which are different from those chosen for the 1584 edition.

The '''Graduate Record Examinations''' ('''GRE''') is a [[standardized test]] that is an admissions requirement for most [[graduate school]]s in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ets.org/Media/Tests/GRE/pdf/gre_0910_online_bulletin.pdf ''GRE Registration and Information Bulletin''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091228213153/http://www.ets.org/Media/Tests/GRE/pdf/gre_0910_online_bulletin.pdf |date=December 28, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The GRE is owned and administered by [[Educational Testing Service]] (ETS).&lt;ref name="questiaalternativeadmissions"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst;jsessionid=L7CZ9n7TH1wtX2NDndzLxl9rQ6HFLLNDrKj2595y7hTz6NzKnCTX!289183844?docId=5006090031|title='Alternative Admissions and Scholarship Selection Measures in Higher Education. (Assessment in Action)' by Sedlacek, William E. - Measurement and Evaluation in Counseling and Development, Vol. 35, Issue 4, January 2003 - Online Research Library: Questia|website=Questia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The test was established in 1936 by the [[Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching]].&lt;ref name="wilkesbarremisericordiasophomores"/&gt;

According to ETS, the GRE aims to measure [[verbal reasoning]], [[quantitative reasoning]], analytical writing, and [[critical thinking]] skills that have been acquired over a long period of learning.  The content of the GRE consists of certain specific algebra, geometry, arithmetic, and vocabulary. The GRE General Test is offered as a computer-based exam administered at [[Prometric]] testing centers. In the graduate school admissions process, the level of emphasis that is placed upon GRE scores varies widely between schools and departments within schools. The importance of a GRE score can range from being a mere admission formality to an important selection factor.

The GRE was significantly overhauled in August 2011, resulting in an exam that is not adaptive on a question-by-question basis, but rather by section, so that the performance on the first verbal and math sections determine the difficulty of the second sections presented. Overall, the test retained the sections and many of the question types from its predecessor, but the scoring scale was changed to a 130 to 170 scale (from a 200 to 800 scale).&lt;ref name="ets.org1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ets.org/gre/revised_general/scores/|title=GRE Revised General Test: Scores|website=Ets.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cost to take the test is [[US$]]205,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; although ETS will reduce the fee under certain circumstances.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; They also promote financial aid to those GRE applicants who prove economic hardship.&lt;ref&gt;MBA Channel: [http://www.mba-channel.com/channel/article/gre-wharton/ "GRE:Wharton joins the club"] 31 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; ETS does not release scores that are older than 5 years, although graduate program policies on the acceptance of scores older than 5 years will vary.

==History==
{{expand section|date=May 2018}}
The Graduate Record Examinations was "initiated in 1936 as a joint experiment in higher education by the graduate school deans of four eastern universities and the [[Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching]]."&lt;ref name="wilkesbarremisericordiasophomores"&gt;{{cite news|title=Misericordia Sophomores Take Graduate Record Tests|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/396100933/?terms=%22Graduate%2BRecord%2BExaminations%22|accessdate=May 29, 2018|work=Wilkes-Barre Times Leader|location=Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania|date=March 25, 1949|page=10|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|registration=yes|quote=Graduate Record Examination project was initiated in 1936 as a joint experiment in higher education by the graduate school deans of four eastern universities and the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. [...] Until the Educational Testing Service was established in January, 1948, the Graduate Record Examination remained a project of the Carnegie Foundation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first universities to experiment the test on their students were [[Harvard University]], [[Yale University]], [[Princeton University]] and [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref name="iowacityrecordsare"/&gt; The [[University of Wisconsin]] was the first public university to ask their students to take the test in 1938.&lt;ref name="wisconsinstateuwdistinguished"&gt;{{cite news|title=U.W.

"Until the [[Educational Testing Service]] was established in January, 1948, the Graduate Record Examination remained a project of the Carnegie Foundation."&lt;ref name="wilkesbarremisericordiasophomores"/&gt;

==Structure==
The computer-based GRE General Test consists of six sections. The first section is always the analytical writing section involving separately timed issue and argument tasks. The next five sections consist of two [[English language|verbal reasoning]] sections, two [[quantitative property|quantitative reasoning]] sections, and either an experimental or research section. These five sections may occur in any order. The experimental section does not count towards the final score but is not distinguished from the scored sections. Unlike the computer adaptive test before August 2011, the GRE General Test is a [[Multistage testing|multistage test]], where the examinee's performance on earlier sections determines the difficulty of subsequent sections. This format allows the examined person to freely move back and forth between questions within each section, and the testing software allows the user to "mark" questions within each section for later review if time remains. The entire testing procedure lasts about 3 hours 45 minutes.&lt;ref name="GRE Test Content"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ets.org/portal/site/ets/menuitem.1488512ecfd5b8849a77b13bc3921509/?vgnextoid=0a51d2b54c0c5010VgnVCM10000022f95190RCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=6236e3b5f64f4010VgnVCM10000022f95190RCRD#Computer_Based_General_Test_Content_and_Structure|title=ETS Home|website=Ets.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GRE-scoring&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ets.org/gre/revised_general/scores/how/|title=GRE Revised General Test: How the Test is Scored|website=Ets.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; One-minute breaks are offered after each section and a 10-minute break after the third section.

The paper-based GRE General Test also consists of six sections. The analytical writing is split up into two sections, one section for each issue and argument task. The next four sections consist of two verbal and two quantitative sections in varying order. There is no experimental section on the paper-based test. This version is only available in areas where the computer-based version is unavailable.

===Verbal section===
The computer-based [[English language|verbal]] sections assess reading comprehension, critical reasoning, and vocabulary usage. The verbal test is scored on a scale of 130–170, in 1-point increments. (Before August 2011, the scale was 200–800, in 10-point increments.) In a typical examination, each verbal section consists of 20 questions to be completed in 30 minutes.&lt;ref name="GRE Test Content"/&gt; Each verbal section consists of about 6 text completion, 4 sentence equivalence, and 10 critical reading questions. The changes in 2011 include a reduced emphasis on rote vocabulary knowledge and the elimination of antonyms and analogies. Text completion items have replaced sentence completions and new reading question types allowing for the selection of multiple answers were added.

===Quantitative section===
The computer-based [[mathematics|quantitative]] sections assess basic high school level mathematical knowledge and reasoning skills. The quantitative test is scored on a scale of 130–170, in 1-point increments (Before August 2011 the scale was 200–800, in 10-point increments). In a typical examination, each quantitative section consists of 20 questions to be completed in 35 minutes.&lt;ref name="GRE Test Content"/&gt; Each quantitative section consists of about 8 quantitative comparisons, 9 problem solving items, and 3 data interpretation questions. The changes in 2011 include the addition of numeric entry items requiring the examinee to fill in the blank and multiple-choice items requiring the examinee to select multiple correct responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{citationm .,m /./.,|last=Weiner-Green|first=Sharon|last2=Wolf|first2=Ira K|title=Barron's How to Prepare for the GRE|edition=17|year=2009|page=9|publisher=Barron's Educational Series|isbn=0-7641-7471-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Analytical writing section===
The analytical writing section consists of two different essays, an "issue task" and an "argument task".  The writing section is graded on a scale of 0–6, in half-point increments. The essays are written on a computer using a word processing program specifically designed by ETS. The program allows only basic computer functions and does not contain a spell-checker or other advanced features. Each essay is scored by at least two readers on a six-point [[holism#Education reform|holist scale]].  If the two scores are within one point, the average of the scores is taken.  If the two scores differ by more than a point, a third reader examines the response.

====Issue Task====
The test taker is given 30 minutes to write an essay about a selected topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ets.org/gre/revised_general/prepare/analytical_writing|title=GRE Revised General Test: Analytical Writing|website=Ets.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Issue topics are selected from a pool of questions, which the GRE Program has published in its entirety.  Individuals preparing for the GRE may access the pool of tasks on the ETS website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ets.org/gre/general/prepare/sample_questions/analytical/issues/|title=GRE General Test: Analytical Writing "Issue" Task Topics|website=Ets.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Argument Task====
The test taker will be given an argument (i.e. a series of facts and considerations leading to a conclusion) and asked to write an essay that critiques the argument.  Test takers are asked to consider the argument's logic and to make suggestions about how to improve the logic of the argument.  Test takers are expected to address the logical flaws of the argument and not provide a personal opinion on the subject. The time allotted for this essay is 30 minutes.&lt;ref name="GRE Test Content"/&gt; The Arguments are selected from a pool of topics, which the GRE Program has published in its entirety.  Individuals preparing for the GRE may access the pool of tasks on the ETS website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ets.org/gre/general/prepare/sample_questions/analytical/argument/|title=GRE General Test: Analytical Writing "Argument" Task Topics|website=Ets.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Experimental section===
The experimental section, which can be either verbal or quantitative, contains new questions ETS is considering for future use. Although the experimental section does not count towards the test-taker's score, it is unidentified and appears identical to the scored sections. Because test takers have no definite way of knowing which section is experimental, it is typically advised that test takers try their best and be focused on every section. Sometimes an identified research section at the end of the test is given instead of the experimental section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ets.org/gre/general/about/content/|title=GRE General Test: Test Content and Structure|website=Ets.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no experimental section on the paper-based GRE.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

==Scoring==
An examinee can miss one or more questions on a multiple-choice section and still receive a perfect score of 170. Likewise, even if no question is answered correctly, 130 is the lowest possible score.&lt;ref name="ets.org1"/&gt;

===Scaled score percentiles===

"Field-wise distribution" of test takers is "limited to those who earned their college degrees up to two years before the test date." ETS provides no score data for "non-traditional" students who have been out of school more than two years, although its own report "RR-99-16" indicated that 22% of all test takers in 1996 were over the age of 30.

==Use in admissions==
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2015}}
Many graduate schools in the United States require GRE results as part of the admissions process. The GRE is a standardized test intended to measure all graduates' abilities in tasks of general academic nature (regardless of their fields of specialization) and the extent to which [[undergraduate]] education has developed their verbal skills, quantitative skills, and [[abstract thinking]].

In addition to GRE scores, admission to graduate schools depends on several other factors, such as GPA, letters of recommendation, and statements of purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gsas.harvard.edu/admissions/apply|title=Apply - Harvard University - The Graduate School of Arts and Sciences|website=Gsas.harvard.edu|accessdate=May 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, unlike other standardized admissions tests (such as the [[SAT]], [[Law School Admission Test|LSAT]], and [[MCAT]]), the use and weight of GRE scores vary considerably not only from school to school, but also from department to department and program to program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.howtogetintograduateschool.com/gre/grad-school-with-low-gre-scores/|title=You CAN Get Into Grad School With Low GRE Scores - academical.|date=June 19, 2016|website=Howtogetintograduateschool.com|accessdate=May 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, most business schools and economics programs require very high GRE or GMAT scores for entry, while engineering programs are known to allow more score variation. Liberal arts programs may only consider the applicant's verbal score, while mathematics and science programs may only consider quantitative ability. Some schools use the GRE in admissions decisions, but not in funding decisions; others use it for selection of scholarship and fellowship candidates, but not for admissions. In some cases, the GRE may be a general requirement for graduate admissions imposed by the university, while particular departments may not consider the scores at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Admission Committees Use GRE Scores|url=http://www.educaidtutoring.com/how-admission-committees-use-gre-scores|publisher=Educaid Tutoring|accessdate=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Graduate schools will typically provide the average scores of previously admitted students and information about how the GRE is considered in admissions and funding decisions. In some cases programs have hard cut off requirements for the GRE; for example, the Yale Economics PhD program requires a minimum quantitative score of 160 to apply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://economics.yale.edu/graduate/application-info|title=Application Information : Department of Economics|website=economics.yale.edu|accessdate=May 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The best way to ascertain how a particular school or program evaluates a GRE score in the admissions process is to contact the person in charge of graduate admissions for the specific program in question.

In February 2016, the [https://law.arizona.edu/ University of Arizona James E. Rogers College of Law] became the first law school to accept either the GRE or the Law School Admissions Test (LSAT) from all applicants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://law.arizona.edu/arizona-law-school-gre|title=UA Becomes First Law School to Open Admissions to All GRE® Test Takers after Study Reveals Test Validity|first=|date=2016-02-10|work=University of Arizona Law|access-date=2017-04-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/lsats-grip-on-law-school-admissions-loosens-1455964203|title=LSAT’s Grip on Law-School Admissions Loosens|last=Randazzo|first=Sara|date=2016-02-22|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2017-04-27|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/06/business/dealbook/law-schools-acceptance-of-gre-test-scores-provokes-tussle.html|title=Law School’s Acceptance of GRE Test Scores Provokes Tussle|last=Olson|first=Elizabeth|date=2016-05-05|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-04-27|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The college made the decision after conducting a study showing that the GRE is a valid and reliable predictor of students' first-term law school grades.

In the spring of 2017, Harvard Law School announced it was joining University of Arizona Law in accepting the GRE in addition to the LSAT from applicants to its three-year J.D. program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://today.law.harvard.edu/gre/|title=In pilot program, Harvard Law will accept GRE for admission - Harvard Law Today|work=Harvard Law Today|access-date=2017-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==GRE Subject Tests==
In addition to the General Test, there are also six GRE Subject Tests testing knowledge in the specific areas of [[GRE Biology Test|Biology]]; [[GRE Chemistry Test|Chemistry]]; [[GRE Literature in English Test|Literature in English]]; [[GRE Mathematics Test|Mathematics]]; [[GRE Physics Test|Physics]]; and [[GRE Psychology Test|Psychology]]. The length of each exam is 170 minutes.

In the past, subject tests were also offered in the areas of Computer Science, Economics, Revised Education, Engineering, Geology, History, Music, Political Science, Sociology, and [[GRE Biochemistry, Cell and Molecular Biology Test|Biochemistry, Cell and Molecular Biology]]. In April 1998, the Revised Education and Political Science exams were discontinued. In April 2000, the History and Sociology exams were discontinued; with Economics, Engineering, Music, and Geology being discontinued in April 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.physicsgre.com/engineering-gre.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-01-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060110144952/http://www.physicsgre.com/engineering-gre.shtml |archivedate=January 10, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Computer Science exam was discontinued after April 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ets.org/gre/subject/about/content/computer_science |title=GRE: Computer Science Test |accessdate=January 14, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102210256/http://www.ets.org/gre/subject/about/content/computer_science |archivedate=January 2, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Biochemistry, Cell and Molecular Biology was discontinued in December 2016.

==GRE and GMAT==
The [[GMAT]] (Graduate Management Admission Test) is a computer-adaptive standardized test in mathematics and the English language for measuring aptitude to succeed academically in graduate business studies.
Business schools commonly use the test as one of many selection criteria for admission into an [[MBA]] program. Starting in 2009, many business schools began accepting the GRE in lieu of a GMAT score. Policies varied widely for several years. However, as of the 2014–2015 admissions season, most business schools accept both tests equally. Either a GMAT score, or a GRE score, can be submitted for an application to an MBA program. Business schools also accept either score for their other (non-MBA) Master's and PhD programs.

The primary issue on which business school test acceptance policies vary is in how old a GRE or GMAT score can be before it is no longer accepted. The standard is that scores cannot be more than 5 years old (e.g., [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania|Wharton]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/mba/admissions/application-requirements.cfm#a6 "Application Requirements: The Wharton MBA Program"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703165630/http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/mba/admissions/application-requirements.cfm#a6 |date=July 3, 2013 }} 9 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt; [[MIT Sloan School of Management|MIT Sloan]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://mitsloan.mit.edu/mba/admissions/apply-here/instructions/?admissions/applicationinstructions.php "MIT Sloan Application Instructions"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620212611/http://mitsloan.mit.edu/mba/admissions/apply-here/instructions/?admissions%2Fapplicationinstructions.php |date=June 20, 2013 }} 9 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt; [[Columbia Business School]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www4.gsb.columbia.edu/mba/admissions/applynow/apprequirements#GMAT "Columbia Business School MBA Program Application Requirements"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511012212/http://www4.gsb.columbia.edu/mba/admissions/applynow/apprequirements |date=May 11, 2013 }} 9 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Preparation==
A variety of resources are available for those wishing to prepare for the GRE. ETS provides preparation software called PowerPrep, which contains two practice tests of retired questions, as well as further practice questions and review material. Since the software replicates both the test format and the questions used, it can be useful to predict the actual GRE scores. ETS does not license their past questions to any other company, making them the only source for official retired material. ETS used to publish the "BIG BOOK" which contained a number of actual GRE questions; however, this publishing was abandoned. Several companies provide courses, books, and other unofficial preparation materials.

Some students taking the GRE use a [[test preparation]] company.  Students who do not use these courses often rely on material from university text books, GRE preparation books, sample tests, and free web resources.

==Testing locations==
While the general and subject tests are held at many undergraduate institutions, the computer-based general test is only held at test centers with appropriate technological accommodations. In the United States, students in major cities or from large universities will usually find a nearby test center, while those in more isolated areas may have to travel a few hours to an urban or university location. Many industrialized countries also have test centers, but at times test-takers must cross country borders.

==Validity==
An analysis of the GRE's validity in predicting graduate school success found a correlation of .30 to .45 between the GRE and both first year and overall graduate GPA.  The correlation between GRE score and graduate school completion rates ranged from .11 (for the now defunct analytical section) to .39 (for the GRE subject test).  Correlations with faculty ratings ranged from .35 to .50.&lt;ref name="Kuncel2001"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kuncel |first=N. R. |last2=Hezlett |first2=S. A. |last3=Ones |first3=D. S. |year=2001 |title=A comprehensive meta-analysis of the predictive validity of the Graduate Record Examination: Implications for graduate student selection and performance |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=127 |issue=1 |pages=162–181 |url=http://web.uvic.ca/psyc/lindsay/teaching/499/readings/kuncel.pdf |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.127.1.162 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927112933/http://web.uvic.ca/psyc/lindsay/teaching/499/readings/kuncel.pdf |archivedate=September 27, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

===Bias===
Critics have claimed that the computer-adaptive methodology may discourage some test takers since the question difficulty changes with performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.ets.org/gre/revised_general/faq/|title = GRE Revised General Test: Frequently Asked Questions}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if the test-taker is presented with remarkably easy questions halfway into the exam, they may infer that they are not performing well, which will influence their abilities as the exam continues, even though question difficulty is subjective. By contrast, standard testing methods may discourage students by giving them more difficult items earlier on.

Critics have also stated that the computer-adaptive method of placing more weight on the first several questions is biased against test takers who typically perform poorly at the beginning of a test due to stress or confusion before becoming more comfortable as the exam continues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailybruin.ucla.edu/archives/id/4597/ |title=Testing service cancels February GRE |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017112548/http://dailybruin.ucla.edu/archives/id/4597/ |archivedate=October 17, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, standard fixed-form tests could equally be said to be "biased" against students with less testing stamina since they would need to be approximately twice the length of an equivalent computer adaptive test to obtain a similar level of precision.&lt;ref name="WeissKingsbury1984"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Weiss |first=D. J. |last2=Kingsbury |first2=G. G. |year=1984 |title=Application of computerized adaptive testing to educational problems |journal=Journal of Educational Measurement |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=361–375 |doi=10.1111/j.1745-3984.1984.tb01040.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GRE has also been subjected to the same racial bias criticisms that have been lodged against other admissions tests. In 1998, ''[[The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education]]'' noted that the mean score for black test-takers in 1996 was 389 on the verbal section, 409 on the quantitative section, and 423 on the analytic, while white test-takers averaged 496, 538, and 564, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first= |title=Estimating the Effect a Ban on Racial Preferences Would Have on African- American Admissions to the Nation's Leading Graduate Schools |journal=The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education |volume=19 |year=1998 |pages=80–82 |jstor=2998926 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Association of Test Directors Symposia in 2004 stated a belief that simple mean score differences may not constitute evidence of bias unless the populations are known to be equal in ability.&lt;ref&gt;The Achievement Gap: Test

C. |last2=Morris |first2=S. B. |year=2008 |title=Raju's Differential Functioning of Items and Tests (DFIT) |journal=Educational Measurement: Issues and Practice |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=43–50 |doi= 10.1111/j.1745-3992.2008.00127.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- And what does the DFIT say about the black-white differences in scores? --&gt;

===Weak predictor of graduate school performance===
The GREs are criticized for not being a true measure of whether a student will be successful in graduate school. [[Robert Sternberg]] (now of [[Oklahoma State University–Stillwater]]; working at [[Yale University]] at the time of the study), a long-time critic of modern intelligence testing in general, found the GRE general test was weakly predictive of success in graduate studies in psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sternberg |first=R. J. |last2=Williams |first2=W. M. |year=1997 |title=Does the Graduate Record Examination predict meaningful success in the graduate training of psychology? A case study |journal=American Psychologist |volume=52 |issue= |pages=630–641 |url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/releases/Aug97/GRE.study.ssl.html |doi=10.1037/0003-066x.52.6.630}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strongest relationship was found for the now-defunct analytical portion of the exam.

The ETS published a report ("What is the Value of the GRE?") that points out the predictive value of the GRE on a student's index of success at the graduate level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ets.org/Media/Tests/GRE/pdf/gre_0809_value_of_gre.pdf|format=PDF|title=Value of GRE|website=Ets.org|accessdate=29 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120611000114/http://www.ets.org/Media/Tests/GRE/pdf/gre_0809_value_of_gre.pdf|archive-date=June 11, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem with earlier studies is the statistical phenomena of restriction of range. A [[correlation]] coefficient is sensitive to the range sampled for the test.  Specifically, if only students accepted to graduate programs are studied (in Sternberg &amp; Williams and other research), the relationship is occluded.  Validity coefficients range from .30 to .45 between the GRE and both first year and overall graduate GPA in ETS' study.&lt;ref name="Kuncel2001" /&gt;

Kaplan and Saccuzzo state that the criterion that the GRE best predicts is first-year grades in graduate school. However, this correlation is only in the high tens to low twenties. "If the test correlates with a criterion at the .4 level, then it accounts for 16% of the variability in that criterion, with the other 84% resulting from unknown factors and errors"&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, R. M. &amp; Saccuzzo, D. P. (2009). Psychological testing: Principles, applications, and issues. Belmont, CA: Wadsworth&lt;/ref&gt; (p.&amp;nbsp;303). Graduate schools may be placing too much importance on standardized tests rather than on factors that more fully account for graduate school success, such as prior research experience, GPAs, or work experience. While graduate schools do consider these areas, many times schools will not consider applicants that score below a current score of roughly 314 (1301 prior score). Kaplan and Saccuzzo also state that "the GRE predict[s] neither clinical skill nor even the ability to solve real-world problems" (p.&amp;nbsp;303).

===Historical susceptibility to cheating===
In May 1994, [[Kaplan, Inc]] warned ETS, in hearings before a New York legislative committee, that the small question pool available to the computer-adaptive test made it vulnerable to cheating. ETS assured investigators that it was using multiple sets of questions and that the test was secure. This was later discovered to be incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/28/us/giant-of-exam-business-keeps-quiet-on-cheating.html | work=The New York Times | title=Giant of Exam Business Keeps Quiet on Cheating | first1=Douglas | last1=Frantz | first2=Jon | last2=Nordheimer | date=September 28, 1997 | accessdate=April 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1994, prompted by student reports of recycled questions, then Director of GRE Programs for Kaplan, Inc and current CEO of [[Knewton]], [[Jose Ferreira]] led a team of 22 staff members deployed to 9 U.S. cities to take the exam. Kaplan, Inc then presented ETS with 150 questions, representing 70–80% of the GRE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/16/us/computer-admissions-test-found-to-be-ripe-for-abuse.html | work=The New York Times | title=Computer Admissions Test Found to Be Ripe for Abuse | date=December 16, 1994 | accessdate=April 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to early news releases, ETS appeared grateful to Stanley H. Kaplan, Inc for identifying the security problem. However, on December 31, ETS sued Kaplan, Inc for violation of a federal electronic communications privacy act, copyright laws, breach of contract, fraud, and a confidentiality agreement signed by test-takers on test day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-01-01/news/mn-15369_1_educational-testing-service | work=Los Angeles Times | title=Educational Testing Service Sues Exam-Coaching Firm | first=Bettina | last=Boxall | date=January 1, 1995 | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 2, 1995, an agreement was reached out of court.

Additionally, in 1994, the scoring algorithm for the computer-adaptive form of the GRE was discovered to be insecure. ETS acknowledged that Kaplan, Inc employees, led by Jose Ferreira, reverse-engineered key features of the GRE scoring algorithms. The researchers found that a test taker's performance on the first few questions of the exam had a disproportionate effect on the test taker's final score. To preserve the integrity of scores, ETS revised its scoring and uses a more sophisticated scoring algorithm.

== 2011 revision ==
In 2006, ETS announced plans to enact significant changes in the format of the GRE. Planned changes for the revised GRE included a longer testing time, a departure from computer-adaptive testing, a new grading scale, and an enhanced focus on reasoning skills and critical thinking for both the quantitative and qualitative sections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princetonreview.com/grad/testprep/testprep.asp?TPRPAGE=880&amp;TYPE=GRE|title=Comparison Chart of GRE Changes|website=Princetonreview.com|accessdate=May 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 2, 2007, ETS announced the decision to cancel plans for revising the GRE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ets.org/portal/site/ets/menuitem.c988ba0e5dd572bada20bc47c3921509/?vgnextoid=e9e8b524b40b1110VgnVCM10000022f95190RCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=dd2d253b164f4010VgnVCM10000022f95190RCRD|title=ETS Home|website=Ets.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The announcement cited concerns over the ability to provide clear and equal access to the new test after the planned changes as an explanation for the cancellation. The ETS stated, however, that they do plan "to implement many of the planned test content improvements in the future", although specific details regarding those changes were not initially announced.

Changes to the GRE took effect on November 1, 2007, as ETS started to include new types of questions in the exam. The changes mostly centered on "fill in the blank" type answers for the mathematics section that requires the test-taker to fill in the blank directly, without being able to choose from a multiple choice list of answers. ETS announced  plans to introduce two of these new types of questions in each quantitative section, while the majority of questions would be presented in the regular format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ets.org/portal/site/ets/menuitem.c988ba0e5dd572bada20bc47c3921509/?vgnextoid=8fc9a1d64ffd3110VgnVCM10000022f95190RCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=bf8146f1674f4010VgnVCM10000022f95190RCRD|title=ETS Home|website=Ets.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since January 2008, the Reading Comprehension within the verbal sections has been reformatted, passages' "line numbers will be replaced with highlighting when necessary in order to focus the test taker on specific information in the passage" to "help students more easily find the pertinent information in reading passages."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ets.org/portal/site/ets/menuitem.c988ba0e5dd572bada20bc47c3921509/?vgnextoid=fbf8d69b413f6110VgnVCM10000022f95190RCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=bf8146f1674f4010VgnVCM10000022f95190RCRD |title=Revisions to the Computer-based GRE General Test in 2008 |accessdate=2008-01-18 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080822044424/http://www.ets.org/portal/site/ets/menuitem.c988ba0e5dd572bada20bc47c3921509/?vgnextoid=fbf8d69b413f6110VgnVCM10000022f95190RCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=bf8146f1674f4010VgnVCM10000022f95190RCRD |archivedate=August 22, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2009, ETS announced plans to move forward with significant revisions to the GRE in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/06/education/06gre.html|title=A New Look for Graduate Entrance Test|date=December 6, 2009|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes include a new 130–170 scoring scale, the elimination of certain question types such as antonyms and analogies, the addition of an online calculator, and the elimination of the CAT format of question-by-question adjustment, in favor of a section by section adjustment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ets.org/gre/revised_general_institutions/|title=GRE Revised General Test: For Institutions|website=Ets.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Revised GRE General test replaced General GRE test on August 1, 2011. The revised GRE is said to be better by design and gives better test taking experience. The new types of questions in the revised pattern are supposed to test the skills needed in graduate and business schools programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ets.org/gre/revised_general/faq/|title=GRE Revised General Test: Frequently Asked Questions|website=Ets.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; From July 2012 onwards GRE announced an option for users to customize their scores called ScoreSelect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GRE Score Select |url=http://gre.learnhub.com/lesson/21133-gre-announces-scoreselect-option-july-2012-onwards |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120525092734/http://gre.learnhub.com/lesson/21133-gre-announces-scoreselect-option-july-2012-onwards |archivedate=May 25, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==GRE before October 2002==

The earliest versions of the GRE tested only for verbal and quantitative ability. For a number of years before October 2002, the GRE had a separate Analytical Ability section which tested candidates on logical and analytical reasoning abilities. This section was replaced by the Analytical Writing Assessment.{{Citation needed|date = February 2014}}

'''iSpring Suite''' is a [[rapid learning]] [[Authoring system|authoring toolkit]] produced by iSpring for developing training  courses in [[Microsoft PowerPoint|PowerPoint]] with embedded (or standalone) quizzes, surveys, and interactions. Its output is compatible with mainstream [[Learning management system|LMS]] standards ([[SCORM]]/[[Aviation Industry Computer-Based Training Committee|AICC]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.moodle.org/22/en/Creating_SCORM_Content|title=Creating SCORM Content|work=docs.moodle.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ispringsolutions.com/articles/lms_support.html|title=LMS support|work=ispringsolutions.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and there is also an option to publish courses specially for [[Blackboard Learning System|BlackBoard LMS]]. The new [[Tin Can API|xAPI (Tin Can)]] format for [[Learning Record Store|LRSes]] is supported as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tincanapi.com/adopters|title=Adopters|work=tincanapi.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Output can be a solid [[SWF| SWF file(s)]], [[EXE| EXE file]], [[HTML]] page or [[Zip (file format)|ZIP]] archive. Additionally, the cross-platform output format ([[Adobe Flash|Flash]] + [[HTML5]]) allows published content to be viewed on any type of modern device.

==History==
In 2005, Flashspring Pro, the prototype of all iSpring products, was released. It was a simple PowerPoint-to-Flash converter with free and commercial versions. Later, iSpring released Flashspring Ultra and [[Sharable Content Object Reference Model|SCORM]] compatibility became available. The companion products FlashSpring Lite and FlashSpring Server were released in 2006 and 2007, respectively. In 2008 the name was changed to iSpring. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.learningsolutionsmag.com/articles/745/making-sense-of-powerpoint-pandemonium|title=Making Sense of PowerPoint Pandemonium|work=learningsolutionsmag.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The current version of iSpring Suite, iSpring Suite 9.0, came out in April 24th, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://elearningindustry.com/press-releases/ispring-suite-9-fast-toolkit-creating-elearning-slides-quizzes-videos|title=iSpring Suite 9: Fast Toolkit For Creating eLearning Slides, Quizzes, And Videos|work=elearningindustry.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===iSpring Suite 7===
One enhancement made to iSpring Suite 7 was the support of combined, cross-platform [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] + [[HTML5]] format. It allowed users to create mobile-ready projects that adapt to any screen size and orientation.

iSpring Suite 7 came with free mobile apps for iOS&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ispring-viewer/id642452385?mt=8|title=iSpring Viewer on the App Store on iTunes|work=[[iOS App Store]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Android,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ispringsolutions.mplayer&amp;hl=en |title=iSpring Mobile Player - Android Apps |via=[[Google Play]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; which allow offline content viewing. The apps collect statistics on learning activity even with no Internet connection and send them to an LMS once the connection is restored.

===iSpring Suite 8===
iSpring Suite 8 introduces several new features to the toolkit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.learningsolutionsmag.com/articles/1804/ispring-suite-8-massive-new-features-not-found-in-standard-elearning-packages|title=iSpring Suite 8: Massive New Features Not Found in Standard eLearning Packages|work=learningsolutionsmag.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In version 8, a conversation simulator was added, allowing users to create simulated dialogues. Also, iSpring Suite 8 has a screen recording tool, allowing users to capture the screen and insert the recording on a PowerPoint slide, an audio/video editor both for screen recordings and audio/video narrations, and a video lecture player to show PowerPoint slides and lecture video side by side.

=== iSpring Suite 9 ===
Released in April 2018, the 9th version introduced 14 new interactions, a new built-in video editor with extended capabilities for screen recording, and major improvements of the quiz editor: the new [[Drag and drop|drag-and-drop]] question, the new built-in [[equation]] editor, extended feedback options, and 7 new survey question templates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.learningsolutionsmag.com/articles/toolkit-ispring-suite-9-adds-a-lot-of-great-new-features|title=Toolkit: iSpring Suite 9 Adds a Lot of Great New Features|work=learningsolutionsmag.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
iSpring Suite includes 5 authoring components: the iSpring add-in, iSpring QuizMaker, conversation simulator, screen recording tool and iSpring Visuals — a set of standalone tools that can be used both separately and together. Additional components available in the publishing interface are PowerPoint-to-Video/YouTube (available separately as iSpring SlideAlloy), and iSpring Cloud hosting and sharing platform.

===iSpring Converter Pro===
iSpring Converter Pro turns PowerPoint projects into mobile-ready online presentations. It supports the standard PowerPoint features such as animation, transition effects and narration facilities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/10things/10-cool-add-ins-for-office-2007-and-2010/2455|title=10 cool add-ins for Office 2007 and 2010|work=techrepublic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and contains additional features that aren't provided by PowerPoint, such as publishing to the Web or an [[Learning Management System|LMS]]. 

===iSpring QuizMaker===
iSpring QuizMaker allows users to create quizzes and surveys.

===iSpring Visuals===
iSpring Visuals adds rich media [[Interaction model|interactions]] to PowerPoint presentations.

===iSpring TalkMaster===

'''Informal learning''' is any learning that is not [[formal learning]] or [[non-formal learning]], such as self-directed learning or learning from experience. Informal learning is organized differently than formal and non-formal learning because it has no set objective in terms of learning outcomes and is never intentional from the learner’s standpoint. For all learners this includes heuristic language building, socialization, enculturation, and play. Informal learning is a pervasive ongoing phenomenon of learning via participation or learning via knowledge creation, in contrast with the traditional view of teacher-centered learning via knowledge acquisition.

The term is often conflated, however, with non-formal learning, and self-directed learning. It is widely used in the context of corporate training and education in relation to return on investment (ROI), or return on learning (ROL). It is also widely used when referring to science education, in relation to citizen science, or informal science education.  The conflated meaning of informal and non-formal learning explicates mechanisms of learning that organically occur outside the realm of traditional instructor-led programs, e.g., reading self-selected books, participating in self-study programs, navigating performance support materials and systems, incidental skills practice, receptivity of coaching or mentoring, seeking advice from peers, or participation in [[communities of practice]], to name a few. Informal learning is common in communities where individuals have opportunities to [[observational learning|observe]] and participate in social activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Paradise|first=Ruth|author2=Barbara Rogoff|title=Side by side: Learning by observing and pitching in|journal=Journal of the Society for Psychological Anthropology|year=2009|pages=102–138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characterizations==
[[File:Open House Day 2015 Long Night of Science at ESO’s Headquarters.jpg|thumb|Open House Day at [[ESO]]’s Headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Open House Day 2015 – Long Night of Science at ESO’s Headquarters|url=http://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1526a/|accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Informal learning can be characterized as the following:
* It usually takes place outside [[education]]al [[school|establishments]];
* It does not follow a specified [[curriculum]] and is not often professionally organized but rather originates accidentally, sporadically, in association with certain occasions, from changing [[practical]] requirements;
* It is not necessarily planned [[pedagogically]], systematically according to fixed [[course (education)|subject]]s, [[test (student assessment)|test]] and [[wikt:qualification|qualification]]-oriented, but rather, either unconsciously incidental or consciously intended intuition, [[holistic]]ally [[problem]]-related, and related to actual situations and fitness for [[life]];
* It is experienced directly in its "[[Nature (philosophy)|natural]]" function of everyday life.
* It is often spontaneous and creative.
* It is a key component to an alternative learning system coined, [[Learning by Observing and Pitching In]] (LOPI),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rogoff|first=Barbara|title=Learning by Observing and Pitching-In Overview|url=http://www.learningbyobservingandpitchingin.com/icp-overview-english|accessdate=May 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is based on the learning methods observed to be common in many Indigenous American communities.

==History==
In international discussions, the concept of informal learning, already used by [[John Dewey]] at an early stage and later on by [[Malcolm Knowles]], experienced a renaissance, especially in the context of development policy. At first, informal learning was only delimited from formal school learning and [[nonformal learning]] in courses ([[P. H. Coombs|Coombs]]/Achmed 1974). Marsick and Watkins take up this approach and go one step further in their definition. They, too, begin with the organizational form of learning and call those learning processes informal which are non-formal or not formally organized and are not financed by institutions ([[K. Watkins|Watkins]]/Marsick, p.&amp;nbsp;12 et sec.). An example for a wider approach is Livingstone's definition which is oriented towards [[autodidactic]] and self-directed learning and places special emphasis on the self-definition of the learning process by the learner ([[D. W. Livingstone|Livingstone]] 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;68 et seq.).

==Differences between informal and non-formal learning==
{{main|Non-formal learning}}
As noted above, informal learning is often confused with non-formal learning. Non-formal learning has been used to often describe organized learning outside of the formal education system, either being short-term, voluntary, and having, few if any, prerequisites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baumgartner|first1=Sharan B. Merriam, Rosemary S. Cafarella, Lisa M.|title=Learning in adulthood : a comprehensive guide|date=2007|publisher=Jossey-Bass|location=San Francisco|isbn=978-0787975883|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; However they typically have a curriculum and often a facilitator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baumgartner|first1=Sharan B. Merriam, Rosemary S. Cafarella, Lisa M.|title=Learning in adulthood : a comprehensive guide|date=2007|publisher=Jossey-Bass|location=San Francisco|isbn=978-0787975883|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; As stated on the non-formal learning page, non-formal learning can be seen in various structured learning situations, such as swimming lessons, community-based sports programs and conference style seminars.

==Other perspective==
Merriam et al. (2007) state: "Informal learning, Schugurensky (2000) suggests, has its own internal forms that are important to distinguish in studying the phenomenon. He proposes three forms: self-directed learning, incidental learning, and socialization, or tacit learning. These differ among themselves in terms of intentionality and awareness at the time of the learning experience. Self-directed learning, for example, is intentional and conscious; incidental learning, which Marsick and Watkins (1990) describe as an accidental by-product of doing something else, is unintentional but after the experience she or he becomes aware that some learning has taken place; and finally, socialization or tacit learning is neither intentional nor conscious (although we can become aware of this learning later through 'retrospective recognition') (Marsick &amp; Watkins, 1990, p. 6)" (p.&amp;nbsp;36). More recently, Bennett (2012) extended Schugurenksky's (2000) conceptualization of informal by recommending four modes of informal learning: a) self-directed, which is conscious and intentional, b) incidental, which is conscious and unintentional, c) tacit, which replaces socialization and is both nonconscious and unintentional, and d) integrative, which is nonconscious and intentional. Drawing upon implicit processing literature, she further defined integrative learning as "a learning process that combines intentional nonconscious processing of tacit knowledge with conscious access to learning products and mental images" (Bennett, 2012, p.&amp;nbsp;4) and she theorized two possible sub-processes: knowledge shifting and knowledge sublimation, which describe limited access learners have to tacit knowledge.

==In American Indigenous communities==
People in many Indigenous communities of the Americas often learn through observation and participation in everyday life of their respective communities and families. Barbara Rogoff, a professor of psychology, and her colleagues describe the ways in which children in Indigenous communities can learn by observing and participating in community endeavors, having an eagerness to contribute, fulfilling valuable roles, and finding a sense of belonging in their community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rogoff|first=B|author2=L. Alcala |author3=A. Coppens |author4=A. Lopez |author5=O. Ruvalcaba |author6=K. Silva |title=Pitching in and catching on: Learning through intent community participation|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These learning experiences rely on children’s incorporation in the community and the child’s attentiveness. This form of informal learning allows the children to collaborate in social endeavors, which grants the child the opportunity to learn by pitching in.

Learning occurs through socialization processes in one's culture and community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pewewardy|first1=Cornel|title=Learning styles of American Indian/Alaska native students: A review of the literature and implications for practice|journal=Journal of American Indian Education|date=2002|volume=41|issue=3|pages=22–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Learning by observing and pitching in (LOPI) is an Informal learning model often seen in many Indigenous communities of the Americas. 
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nvit.bc.ca/docs/learning%20styles%20of%20american%20indianalaska%20native%20students%20a%20review%20of%20the%20literature%20and%20implications%20for%20practice.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Children can be seen participating alongside adults in many daily activities within the community. An example is the process where children learn slash-and-burn agriculture by being present in the situation and contributing when possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gaskins|first=S|title=Children's Daily Activities in a Mayan Village: A Culturally Grounded Description|journal=Cross-Cultural Research|year=2000|volume=34|issue=4|pages=375–389|doi=10.1177/106939710003400405}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Noteworthy is children's own initiative and assumption of responsibility to perform tasks for the households' benefit. Many Indigenous communities provide self-paced opportunities to kids, and allow exploration and education without parental coercion. Collaborative input is highly encouraged and valued.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Children's Initiative in Contributions to Family Work in Indigenous-Heritage and Cosmopolitan Communities in Mexico|last = Alcala|first = et. al.|date = 2014|journal = Human Development |doi = 10.1159/000356763|pmid = |access-date =|volume=57|issue = 2–3|pages=96–115|bibcode = 2001HuDev..44..103S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both children and adults are actively involved in shared endeavors. Their roles as learner and expert are flexible, while the observer participates with active concentration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Paradise|first=R|author2=B. Rogoff2|title=Side-by Side: Learning by Observing and Pitching In|journal=Journal of the Society for Psychology and Anthropology|year=2009|pages=102–138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indigenous ways of learning include practices such as [[Observational learning#Indigenous communities of the Americas|observation]], experiential learning, and apprenticeship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hart|first=M|title=Indigenous Knowledge and Research: The Míkiwáhp as a Symbol for Reclaiming Our Knowledge and Ways of Knowing|url=http://journals.sfu.ca/fpcfr/index.php/FPCFR/article/view/26/64|journal=The First Peoples Child &amp; Family Review|year=2007|volume=3|issue=1|pages=83–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Child work in indigenous American cultures|Child work]], alongside and combined with play, occupies an important place in American Indigenous children’s time and development. The interaction of a Navajo girl assisting her mother weaving and who eventually becomes a master weaver herself illustrates how the child's presence and the availability of these activities allow the child to learn through observation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Göncü|first=A.|title=Children’s and researchers’ engagement in the world|journal=Library of Congress Catalog|year=1999|pages=3–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Children start at the periphery, observing and imitating those around them, before moving into the center of activities under supervision and guidance. An example of 2-year-old Indigenous Mexican girl participating in digging-the-holes project with her mother highlights children's own initiation to help, after watching, and enthusiasm to share the task with family and community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Schooling and traditional collaborative social organization of problem solving by Mayan mothers and children |journal = Developmental Psychology|pages = 55–66|volume = 38|issue = 1|doi = 10.1037/0012-1649.38.1.55|first = Pablo|last = Chavajay|first2 = Barbara|last2 = Rogoff|pmid=11806702|date=Jan 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Work is part of a child’s development from an early age, starting with simple tasks that merge with play and develop to various kinds of useful work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bourdillon|first=M.|author2=D. Levison |author3=D. White |author4=W. Myers |title=A place for work in children’s lives?|journal=Plan|year=2009|pages=1–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The circumstances of everyday routine create opportunities for the culturally meaningful activities and sensitive interactions on which a child's development depends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Farver|first=J.A.M.|title=Activity setting analysis: A model for examining the role of culture in development|journal=Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge|year=1999|pages=99–127}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children of the Chillihuani observe their environment as a place of respect, and learn from observation. Many of them become herders by informal learning in observation. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Growing Up in a Culture of Respect|last=Bolin|first=Inge|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=2006|isbn=978-0-292-70982-9|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children in Nicaragua will often learn to work the land or learn to become street vendors by watching other individuals in their community perform it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Liebel|first=M.|title=The dignity of the working child: What children in Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala think about their work|journal=Working Children's Protagonism: Social Movements and Empowerment in Latin America, Africa and India|year=2001|pages=53–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These activities provide opportunities for children to learn and develop through forms of social learning which are made up of everyday experiences rather than a deliberate curriculum, and contain ordinary setting in which children’s social interaction and behavior occur.  Informal learning for children in American Indigenous communities can take place at work where children are expected to contribute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gaskin|first=S.|title=Children's Daily Activities in a Mayan Village: A Culturally Grounded Description|journal=Cross-Cultural Research|year=2000|volume=34|issue=4|pages=375–389|doi=10.1177/106939710003400405}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nonverbal communication as a learning tool===

In terms of the cultural variation between traditional Indigenous American and European-American middle class, the prevalence of nonverbal communication can be viewed as being dependent on each culture’s definition of achievement. Often in mainstream middle-class culture, success in school and work settings is gained through practicing competitiveness and working for personal gain.&lt;ref&gt;Wynia, E. A. (2000). Teach the way the student learns: Culturally relevant teaching strategies appropriate to the native american student in the speech communication classroom. North Dakota Journal of Speech and Theatre, 14.&lt;/ref&gt; The learning and teaching practices of traditional Indigenous Americans generally prioritize harmony and cooperation over personal gain.In order to achieve mutual respect in teachings, what is often relied on in Indigenous American culture is nonverbal communication.&lt;ref&gt;Hwang, C. Philip, Michael E. Lamb, and Irving E. Siegel. "Learning Respect for Everything: Navajo Images of Development." Images of Childhood. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 1996. 167-83.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonverbal communication in Indigenous communities creates pathways of knowledge by watching and then doing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 3195944|title = Interactional Style and Nonverbal Meaning: Mazahua Children Learning How to be Separate-but-Together|journal = Anthropology &amp; Education Quarterly|volume = 25|issue = 2|pages = 156–172|last1 = Paradise|first1 = Ruth|year = 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example where nonverbal behavior can be used as a learning tool can be seen in Chillihuani culture. Children in this community learn about growing crops by observing the actions and respect adults have for the land. They learn that caring for their crops is vital for them to grow and in turn for the community to thrive. Similarly, when children participate in rituals, they learn the importance of being part of the community by watching how everyone interacts. This again needs no explicit verbal communication, it relies solely on observing the world around. Chillihuani culture does not explicitly verbalize expectations. Their knowledge is experienced rather than explained through modeled behavior for community benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ennew | first1 = J | year = 2010 | title = Growing up in a culture of respect: child rearing in highland Peru – By Bolin, Inge | url = | journal = Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute | volume = 16 | issue = | pages = 168–169 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9655.2009.01604_5.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the indigenous culture of the Matsigenka, infants are kept in close proximity to their mother and members of the community. The infant does not go far from the mother at any time. In this way, the child is encouraged to explore away from the mother and other family members who will still keep watch. As the child wanders he may come to a place that is unknown and potentially dangerous but the mother will not stop him, she will just watch as he explores. The lack of verbal reprimand or warning from an adult or elder enable the child to assimilate his surroundings more carefully.&lt;ref&gt;Ochs, E., &amp; Izquierdo, C. (n.d.). Responsibility in childhood: Three developmental trajectories.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formal and informal education==
To fully understand informal learning it is useful to define the terms "formal" and "informal" education. Formal education can be defined as a setting that is highly institutionalized, can be possibly bureaucratic,  while being curriculum driven, and formally recognized with grades, diplomas, or other forms of certifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baumgartner|first1=Sharan B. Merriam, Rosemary S. Cafarella, Lisa M.|title=Learning in adulthood : a comprehensive guide|date=2007|publisher=Jossey-Bass|location=San Francisco|isbn=978-0787975883|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Informal education is closely tied in with informal learning, which occurs in a variety of places, such as at home, work, and through daily interactions and shared relationships among members of society. Informal learning often takes place outside educational establishments, and does not follow a specified curriculum and may originate accidentally, or sporadically, in association with certain occasions, although that is not always the case. Informal education can occur in the formal arena when concepts are adapted to the unique needs of individual students.

==Research and data==
Merriam and others (2007) state: "studies of informal learning, especially those asking about adults' self-directed learning projects, reveal that upwards of 90 percent of adults are engaged in hundreds of hours of informal learning. It has also been estimated that the great majority (upwards of 70 percent) of learning in the workplace is informal (Kim, Collins, Hagedorn, Williamson, &amp; Chapman, 2004), although billions of dollars each year are spent by business and industry on formal training programs" (p.&amp;nbsp;35–36). Both formal and informal learning are considered integral processes for Virtual Human Resource Development (Bennett, 2009), with informal learning the stronger form.

==Experiences and examples==
Informal knowledge is information that has not been externalized or captured and the primary locus of the knowledge may be inside someone's head. (Grebow, David, "At the Water Cooler of Learning" in Conner, M. L., &amp; Clawson, J.G. (eds.) "Transforming Culture: An Executive Briefing on the Power of Learning", Charlottesville: University of Virginia, 2002). For example, in the cause of [[language acquisition]], a mother may teach a child basic concepts of grammar and language at home, prior to the child entering a 
formal education system (Eaton, Sarah (2011). "Family Literacy and the New Canadian: Formal, Non-Formal and .Informal Learning: The Case of Literacy, Essential Skills and Language Learning in Canada"). In such a case, the mother has a tacit understanding of language structures, syntax and morphology, but she may not be explicitly aware of what these are. She understands the language and passes her knowledge on to her offspring.

Other examples of informal knowledge transfer include instant messaging, a spontaneous meeting on the Internet, a phone call to someone who has information you need, a live one-time-only sales meeting introducing a new product, a chat-room in real time, a chance meeting by the water cooler, a scheduled Web-based meeting with a real-time agenda, a tech walking you through a repair process, or a meeting with your assigned mentor or manager.

Experience indicates that much of the learning for performance is informal (The Institute for Research on Learning, 2000, Menlo Park). Those who transfer their knowledge to a learner are usually present in real time. Such learning can take place over the telephone or through the Internet, as well as in person.

In the UK, the government formally recognized the benefits of informal learning in "The Learning Revolution" White Paper published on March 23, 2009 (Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, 2009). The Learning Revolution Festival ran in October 2009 and funding has been used by libraries—which offer a host of informal learning opportunities such as book groups, "meet the author" events and family history sessions—to run activities such as [http://www.northeastlibraries.org.uk The North East Festival of Learning].

==Trends in formal and informal learning==
40% of adults have self-taught themselves at some point and respondents in a survey indicated that they were twice as likely to participate in independent learning as traditional learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Livingstone|first1=D.W.|title=Informal Learning: Conceptual Distinctions and Preliminary Findings|journal=Counterpoints|date=2006|volume=249|pages=203–227}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The average adult spends 10 hours a week (500 hours a year) on informal learning practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Livingstone|first1=D.W.|title=Informal Learning: Conceptual Distinctions and Preliminary Findings|journal=Counterpoints|date=2006|volume=249|pages=203–227}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As a whole, this type of knowledge is more learner-centered and [[situational]] in response to the interests or needed application of the skill to a particular workforce. Formal training programs have limited success in increasing basic skills for individuals older than age 25, therefore, these individuals rely mostly on [[on-the-job training]].

Although rates of formal education have increased, many adults entering the workforce are lacking the basic math, reading and [[interpersonal skills]] that the “unskilled” labor force requires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lerman|first1=Robert I.|last2=Schmidt|first2=Stefanie R.|title=The Low-Skilled Labor Market|url=https://www.dol.gov/oasam/programs/history/herman/reports/futurework/conference/trends/trendsVII.htm|website=US Department of Labor}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lines between formal and informal learning have been blurred due to the higher rates of college attendance. The largest increase in population for manual or low-skilled labor is in individuals who attended college but did not receive a degree. A recent collection of cross-sectional surveys were conducted and polled employers across the United States to gauge which skills are required for jobs which do not require college degrees. These surveys concluded that 70% require some kind of customer service aspect, 61% require reading or writing paragraphs, 65% require math, 51% require the use of computers. In regards to training and academic credentials, 71% require a high school diploma, 61% require specific vocational experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lerman|first1=Robert I.|last2=Schmidt|first2=Stefanie R.|title=The Low-Skilled Labor Market|url=https://www.dol.gov/oasam/programs/history/herman/reports/futurework/conference/trends/trendsVII.htm|website=US Department of Labor}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rates of men entering the low-skilled labor force have remained static over the last fifty years, indicating a shift of less than 1%. Women’s participation in the unskilled labor force has steadily increased and projections indicate that this trend will continue.

==Business perspective==
The majority of companies that provide training are currently involved only with the formal side of the continuum. Most of today's investments are on the formal side. The net result is that companies spend the most money on the smallest part—25%—of the learning equation. The other 75% of learning happens as the learner creatively "adopts and adapts to ever changing circumstances". The informal piece of the equation is not only larger, it's crucial to learning how to do anything.

==Summary==
Lifelong learning, as defined by the [[OECD]], includes a combination of formal, non-formal and informal learning. Of these three, informal learning may be the most difficult to quantify or prove, but it remains critical to an individual's overall cognitive and social development throughout the lifespan.

[[File:Institución Libre de Enseñanza 1889.JPG|thumb|The board of directors for the 1889–1890 ILE course.]]
'''La Institución Libre de Enseñanza (ILE)''' or ''The Free Educational Institution'' was an educational project that developed in Spain for the half a century of about 1876–1936. The institute was inspired by the philosophy of [[Krausism]] which was first introduced to the [[Complutense University of Madrid]] by [[Julián Sanz del Río]], and which (despite being subsequently ejected from that university) had a significant impact on the renovation of the intellectual life within the [[Restoration (Spain)|Spanish culture]] of the time.

The institution was founded in 1876 by a group of disaffected university professors including [[Francisco Giner de los Ríos]], [[Gumersindo Azcarate]], [[Teodoro Sainz Rueda]] and [[Nicolás Salmerón]] among others who distanced themselves from the main university campus of Madrid to achieve [[academic freedom]]. They declined to adjust their teaching to any official religious dogma or the moral and political imposition of the time. Consequently, they had to continue their educational work outside the state sector by creating a secular private educational institution, starting with university level instruction and later extending their activities to primary and secondary education.

They supported and seconded the intellectual ideas of [[Joaquín Costa]], [[Leopoldo Alas]] (Clarín), [[José Ortega y Gasset]], [[Gregorio Marañón]], [[Ramón Menéndez Pidal]], [[Antonio Machado]], [[Joaquín Sorolla]], [[Augusto González Linares]], [[Santiago Ramón y Cajal]] and [[Federico Rubio]], among others who were involved in educational, cultural and social renewal.

==History==
Following the implementation of the political model of [[Antonio Cánovas del Castillo]] whose idea was to secure a fundamentalist nation as ordained by the divine will, which project was to be implemented in 1875 by "[[Decree|Royal Decree]] issued by education minister [[Manuel Orovio Echagüe]]. This regulation severely limited academic freedom in Spain "if it went against the tenets of faith" meaning the contemporary and deeply conservative ([[Roman Catholicism in Spain]]).&lt;ref&gt;Arturo Ruiz, Alberto Sánchez y Juan Pedro Bellón, ''Historiografía ibérica y el problema nacional.'' [http://www.ujaen.es/centros/caai/faseIareaI.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1881, these professors migrated to the independent ILE and were to train [[Manuel Bartolomé Cossio]], who was to succeed Giner in leading the institution, as well as [[Ricardo Rubio Álvarez de Linera|Ricardo Rubio]], [[Pedro Blanco Suárez]], [[Angel do Rego]], [[Joseph Ontañón Arias]], [[Pedro Jiménez-Landi]], among many others who nurtured the project.

Such [[Alumnus|alumni]] ensured a future in which the institution became the foremost Spanish cultural epicenter promoting the most advanced contemporary educational and scientific theories from around the world until finally it was stalled by the [[Spanish Civil War]] in 1936 following which all such [[Progressivism|progressive]] education was destroyed by the [[Conservatism|ultra-conservative]] [[Francoist Spain|Francoist regime]].

The list of contributors published in  ''The Bulletin of the Free Institution of Education '' included [[Bertrand Russell]], [[Henri Bergson]], [[Charles Darwin]], [[John Dewey]], [[Santiago Ramón y Cajal]], [[Miguel de Unamuno]], [[Montessori]], [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[H. G. Wells]], [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[Juan Ramón Jiménez]], [[Gabriela Mistral]], [[Benito Perez Galdos]], [[Emilia Pardo Bazán]], [[Azorin]] [[Eugenio d'Ors]] or [[Ramón Pérez de Ayala]], some of them closely linked to the institution, such as [[Julián Sanz del Río]], [[Demófilo]] and children [[Antonio Machado]] and [[Manuel Machado (poet and playwright)|Manuel Machado]], [[Julio Rey Pastor]], [[Constancio Bernaldo de Quirós]], [[Luis Simarro]], [[Nicholas Achúcarro]], [[Francisco Barnes Salinas]] or Portuguese [[Alice Pestana]].
[[File:La Canariera, de Franzen.jpg|thumb|right| Alumni of primary education of the Free Institution of Education, c. 1903 photograph of [[Christian Franzen]].]]
The ILE began to critically investigate the Spanish past, and from it emerged the  '''''Center for Historical Studies''''' led by the founder of the Spanish philological school, [[Ramón Menéndez Pidal]] as well as contact centers for artistic and scientific elites with the European avant-garde movement, notably the [[Residencia de estudiantes]] led by [[Alberto Jiménez Fraud]]) and the ''Junta para la Ampliación de Estudios'' (Board for Advanced Studies and Scientific Research), organized by [[José Castillejo]].

The poetical movement [[Generation of '27]] was, in a way, an emanation of the ILE intended to attain Spanish cultural and scientific harmony with Europe shortly before modernization was halted by the [[Spanish Civil War]], after which all progressive educational assets were confiscated and its proponents into exile by [[Francoist Spain]].  Those who remained faced censorship, persecution and ridicule, as it was considered unpatriotic and antihispánic by their detractors. Abroad, exiles were dispersed throughout Europe and Latin America, moving to different countries and thus cross-fertilizing the cultural and progressive ideas throughout the western world.

Following the [[Spanish transition to democracy]] about 1978, when the legal process of recovering the legacy of the institution began, ILE funds have been managed by the '' Fundación Francisco Giner de los Ríos '' created for that purpose.

==Modern influence==
The influence of the ILE was instrumental in getting the transitional Spanish government to undertake a series of necessary reforms in the legal, educational and social fields. Agencies such as ''The National Pedagogical Museum'' and ''The Board for Advanced Scientific Studies and Research''  were created o send students to study on scholarship abroad.

The ''Center for Historical Studies'' mentioned above, together with ''The National Institute of Physics and Natural Science'' and the '' [[Residencia de Estudiantes]]'', established in Calle Pinar, Madrid, became hotbeds of writers and artists in which [[Albert Einstein]] gave lectures in Spain in 1923.

Attempts at educational reform crystallized between 1907–1936 via pioneering initiatives such as the School Institute, school holiday camps, the ''International Summer School at the [[University of Santander]]'' as well as various educational missions which operated under the auspices of the [[Second Spanish Republic]] in order to disseminate education and culture in remote and rural settlements throughout Spain

About a year after his death in 1915, followers of [[Francisco Giner de los Ríos]] established a foundation bearing his name to ensure the continuity of the ILE and pursue its educational objectives. The Foundation published the '' Complete Works '' of Francisco Giner, between 1916 and 1936.

There are still schools that are linked to the current Foundation Giner de los Ríos, and continue to provide, with certain variations, the educational model of the ILE like the Colegio Estudio, founded in 1940 by [[Jimena Menéndez Pidal]], [[Angels Gasset]] and [[Carmen Garcia Right]], which helped to educate known Spanish intellectuals and politicians; later also similar private institutions emerged, like Colegio Base and [[Colegio Estilo]]. [[Colegio Estilo]] was founded in 1959 by Spanish writer [[Josefina Aldecoa]]. 

===Fingoy Projects===
One of the more curious effects of the ILE is the College Fingoy in the city of [[Lugo]], which was founded in the teeth of [[Filangist]] opposition in 1950 by [[Antonio Fernández López]] , a businessman and philanthropist of [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], with intention to develop the ideas of the Free Institution of Education in Franco's Spain.

Antonio Fernández López had experienced the Residencia de estudantes sponsored by The Board of Advanced Studies in Madrid during the nineteen twenties and thirties. Returning to his native Galicia, he decided to promote a study center with the same principles in the city of Lugo for the education of his 12 children as well as his siblings Manuel and Conchita.

College Fingoy was only the second mixed (boys + girls) school to be opened in Franco's Spain and the agriculture classes, theater, music and dance were held the [[Galician language]].  during the early years it was led by [[Ricardo Carvalho Calero]], a university professor and Galician intellectual who was victimized by the Franco regime.

College Fingoy also featured class intellectuals and Galician artists such as the poet [[Xosé Luís Méndez Ferrín]], former President of the [[Royal Galician Academy]], [[Bernardino Grana]] or painter [[Luis Gomez Pacios|Pacios]]. He also created the Center for Studies and experience Fingoy the [[Barreiros Farm]], governed by the same ILE principles.

==Promotion==
===First phase===
The initiation was mainly from men who, in one way or another, gathered around Giner after his return to the university in 1881 after his 1875 expulsion. They included [[Manuel Bartolomé Cossio]], [[Joaquín Costa]], [[Leopoldo Alas (Clarín)|Leopoldo Alas]] (Clarín), [[Calderon and Alfredo Arana|Alfredo Calderon]], [[Eduardo Soler]], [[Messia Jacinto]] [[Adolfo Posada]], [[Pedro Dorado Montero]], [[Aniceto Sela]], [[Rafael Altamira]], and others.

===Second phase===
Giner called the acolytes of the ILE his "children" who included [[Julian Besteiro]], [[Pedro Corominas]], [[José Manuel Pedregal]], [[Martin Navarro Flores]], [[Constancio Bernaldo Quiros]], [[Manuel Machado (poet and playwright)|Manuel]] and [[Antonio Machado]], [[Domingo Barnés]], [[José Castillejo]], [[Gonzalo Jimenez de la Espada]], [[Luis de Zulueta]] [[Fernando de los Rios]], and others.

===Third phase===
Those born between 1880 and 1890, are recognized as the "grandchildren" of Giner; usually mentioned among the star pupils are [[José Pijoán]], [[Juan Ramón Jiménez]], [[Francisco Ribera Pastor]], [[José Ortega y Gasset]], [[Américo Castro]], [[Gregorio Marañón]] [[Manuel García Morente]], [[Lorenzo Luzuriaga]], [[Paul Azcarate]], [[Alberto Jiménez Fraud]], etc.

==Headquarters==
The founding 200 shareholders abandoned first proposed ILE headquarters in the [[Paseo de la Castellana]] since occupied by the Military School and rented instead an apartment in Calle Esparteros 9, (currently renumbered as Nº. 11), and subsequently relocated to Infantas Nº. 42 before moving again th Paseo del Oblisco Nº. 8 (since 1914 known as Paseo del General Martínez Campos Nº.14  &amp; Nº16)

The building block included a garden, in what was then the outskirts of Madrid, and was much more suited to the educational concept of the institution. In 1908 the site was further developed with the construction of "Pavilion Giner" and "Soler Hall."

At the time of the [[Spanish Civil War]] The building was heavily damaged and looted, and even underwent a symbolic destruction of trees by a group of Falangist extremist thugs (only a century old acacia and privet were saved). In 1940 the site was seized and attached to the Ministry of Education, refitted (1942) and reopened (1945) as "School Group Joaquin Sorolla" (close to the present [[Sorolla Museum]]). After 1955 its premises were used as headquarters of the School Food Service.

After the [[Spanish Transition|Transition]], the facility was briefly opened as the "Eduardo Marquina National College" (1980–1985); but was finally allocated to the Free Institution of Education in 1982. Recent rehabilitation reforms have meant that the ILE now has state-of-the-art buildings &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://fueradeserie.expansion.com/2015/04/21/arquitectura/1429632894.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''International education''' refers to a dynamic concept that involves a journey or movement of people, minds, or ideas across political and cultural frontiers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moran Hansen|first=Holly|date=2002|title=Defining international education|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/he.41|journal=New Directions for Higher Education|language=en|volume=2002|issue=117|pages=5–12|doi=10.1002/he.41|issn=0271-0560}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is facilitated by the [[globalization]] phenomenon, which increasingly erases the constraints of geography on economic, social and cultural arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook on Globalization and Higher Education|last=King|first=Roger|last2=Marginson|first2=Simon|last3=Naidoo|first3=Rajani|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|year=2011|isbn=9781848445857|location=Cheltenham, UK|pages=324}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept involves a broad range of learning, covering, for instance, [[Formal learning|formal education]] and [[informal learning]] (e.g. training, [[Student exchange program|exchange programs]], [[cross-cultural communication]]).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Annual Review of Comparative and International Education 2017|last=Wiseman|first=Alexander|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing|year=2018|isbn=9781787437661|location=Bingley, WA|pages=211-212}}&lt;/ref&gt; It could also involve a reorientation of academic outlook such as the pursuit of “worldmindedness” as a goal so that a school or its academic focus is considered [[International school|international]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For example, the [[Association of Public and Land-grant Universities|National Association of State Universities]] prescribes the adoption of "proper education" that reflects the full range of international, social, political, cultural, and economic dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Engineering Technology, Engineering Education and Engineering Management: Proceedings of the 2014 International Conference on Engineering Technology, Engineering Education and Engineering Management (ETEEEM 2014), Hong Kong, 15-16 November 201|last=Tan|first=Deyao|publisher=CRC Press|year=2015|isbn=9781138027800|location=Boca Raton, FL|pages=205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The emergence of international education as a discipline may be attributed to the international and intercontinental initiatives of the past, which aimed to achieve education, learning, and intellectual exchange. This is demonstrated in the formalized academic relations between countries in the form of bilateral and scientific agreements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Routledge Handbook of International Education and Development|last=McGrath|first=Simon|last2=Gu|first2=Qing|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=9780415747547|location=Oxon|pages=333}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, international education is considered a mechanism of international cooperation and, in some cases, it stems from the recognition that different cultures offer different outlooks and styles of learning and teaching in addition to the transfer of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Enhancing Asia-Europe Co-operation Through Educational Exchange|last=Wessala|first=Georg|publisher=Routledge|year=2011|isbn=9780415481946|location=Oxon|pages=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

There are scholars who associate the development of international education with [[comparative education]],&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Comparative Education: The Dialectic of the Global and the Local|last=Arnove|first=Robert|last2=Torres|first2=Carlos Alberto|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|year=2007|isbn=0742559858|location=Lanham, MD|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is concerned with the evaluation and scrutiny of different educational systems in various countries for the purpose of developing an education and educational structures that are global in scope and application. This concept is considered ancient, having been used in [[classical Greece]], while the actual term was first used by [[William Russell (educator)|William Russell]] in 1826.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=International Handbook of Comparative Education|last=Cowen|first=Robert|last2=Kazamias|first2=Andreas|publisher=Springer|year=2009|isbn=9781402064029|location=Dordrecht|pages=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; International education diverged from it as it assumed the form of more organized programs that bring together learners and teachers from different countries to learn from each other.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Definitions ==
International education can be seen as developing ‘international-mindedness,’ or enhancing international attitude and awareness &lt;ref name=":04"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cambridge *|first=James|last2=Thompson|first2=Jeff|date=2004|title=Internationalism and globalization as contexts for international education|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/0305792042000213994|journal=Compare: A Journal of Comparative and International Education|language=en|volume=34|issue=2|pages=161–175|doi=10.1080/0305792042000213994|issn=0305-7925|via=Taylor &amp; Francis Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;. From an ideological perspective, international education has a focus on moral development, by influencing the creation of “positive attitudes towards peace, international understanding and responsible world citizenship”&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;.

From a pragmatic approach, international education can relate to economic and cultural globalization&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;. For instance, there are increasing demands for education qualifications to be transferable between schools and education systems&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;. Furthermore, there is a “spread of global quality standards through quality assurances procedures such as accreditation”&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;.

Overall, international education can be viewed as the following:  

* Promoting international understanding/international-mindedness and/or global awareness/understanding&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

* Being active in global engagement/global or world citizenship&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tate|first=Nicholas|date=2013|title=International education in a post-Enlightenment world|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/00131911.2013.785938|journal=Educational Review|language=en|volume=65|issue=3|pages=253–266|doi=10.1080/00131911.2013.785938|issn=0013-1911|via=Taylor &amp; Francis Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Increasing intercultural understanding and respect for difference&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

* Encouraging tolerance and commitment to peace &lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Direct examples of international education include facilitating students’ entry into universities outside of their home countries&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hayden|first=Mary|last2=McIntosh|first2=Shona|date=2018-02-06|title=International education: the transformative potential of experiential learning|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/03054985.2017.1402757|journal=Oxford Review of Education|language=en|volume=44|issue=4|pages=403–413|doi=10.1080/03054985.2017.1402757|issn=0305-4985|via=Taylor &amp; Francis Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Also, temporarily studying abroad is another illustration of international education&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;.

The International Baccalaureate (IB) Program is seen as an influence in the development of international education&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;. The IB Diploma Program encourages students to learn and understand different cultures, languages, and points of view&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. This idea is incorporated into elements of the program e.g. Creativity, Activity, Service (CAS) &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. CAS requires students to participate in activities promoting each of these three components. Through such activities, the intention is that global issues will affect students’ understanding of the world in a meaningful way&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. Specifically, these non-formal, non-academic experiences should enhance students’ comprehension of world issues in a manner that, for instance, reading books or participating in lessons may not &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;.

Based on student engagement and involvement, two general meanings emerge. The first refers to education that transcends national borders through the exchange of people. A good example would be students traveling to study at an [[international branch campus]], as part of a [[study abroad]] program or as part of a [[student exchange program]].{{According to whom|date=June 2018}} The second is a comprehensive approach to education that intentionally prepares students to be active and engaged participants in an interconnected world.{{According to whom|date=June 2018}}

The [[International Baccalaureate]] however, defines the term according to a certain criteria. This criteria include the development of citizens of the world in accordance with culture, language, and social cohesion, building a sense of identity and cultural awareness, encrypting recognition and development of universal human values, encouraging discovery and enjoyment of learning, equipping students with collectivist or individualistic skills and knowledge that can be applied broadly, fostering global thinking when responding to local situations, encourage diversity and flexibility in teaching pedagogic methodologies, and supply appropriate forms of assessment and international benchmarking.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

While definitions vary, '''international education''' is generally taken{{By whom|date=June 2018}} to include:
* Knowledge of other world regions &amp; cultures;
* Familiarity with international and [[global studies|global issues]];
* Skills in working effectively within global or cross-cultural environments, and using information from different sources around the world;
* Ability to communicate in multiple languages; and
* Dispositions towards respect and concern for other cultures and peoples.

==Millennium Development Goals==
One of the eight [[Millennium Development Goals|millennium development goals]] ratified in the [[United Nations]] in the year 2000, focuses on achieving universal primary education&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wysokińska|first=Zofia|date=March 2017|title=Millennium Development Goals/UN and Sustainable Development Goals/UN as Instruments for Realizing Sustainable Development Concept in the Global Economy|url=https://libproxy.berkeley.edu/login?qurl=http%3a%2f%2fsearch.ebscohost.com%2flogin.aspx%3fdirect%3dtrue%26db%3dbth%26AN%3d121741476%26site%3deds-live|journal=Comparative Economic Research|volume=20|pages=101-118|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt;. {{non sequitur|date=June 2018}}

== Sustainable Development Goals ==
At the end of 2015, the United Nations led another initiative to continue on the work of development goals. [[Sustainable Development Goals|The Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs) contains 17 global goals, which are more extensive than the [[Millennium Development Goals|Millenium Development Goals]] (MDGs). Compared to the 2015 MDGs, the SDGs tries to ensure that no one is left behind. In this regard, not only state actors, but also major private “non-state” actors and multinational companies are involved and active in global education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ei-ie.org/en/detail_page/4918/sustainable-development-goals|title=Sustainable Development Goals : Education International|last=International|first=Education|work=Education International|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Education is stated under Goal 4 of the SDGs: “Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg4|title=Goal 4 .:. Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform|website=sustainabledevelopment.un.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, SDGs promote international education through some of the following targets:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg4|title=Goal 4 .:. Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform|website=sustainabledevelopment.un.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* “By 2030, ensure that all learners acquire the knowledge and skills needed to promote sustainable development, including, among others, through education for sustainable development and sustainable lifestyles, human rights, gender equality, promotion of a culture and non-violence, global citizenship and appreciation of cultural diversity, and of culture’s contribution to sustainable development” (Target 4.7)

* “By 2020, substantially expand globally the number of scholarships available to developing countries, in particular least developed countries, small island developing States and African countries, for enrollment in higher education, including vocational training and information and communications technology, technical, engineering, and scientific programs, in developed countries and other developing countries” (Target 4.B)

* “Volume of official development assistance flows for scholarships by sector and type of study” (Indicator 4.B.1)

* “By 2030, substantially increase the supply of qualified teachers, including through international cooperation for teacher training in developing countries, especially least developed countries and small island developing States” (Target 4.C)

* “Proportion of teachers in: (a) pre-primary; (b) primary; (c) lower secondary; and (d) upper secondary education who have received at least the minimum organized teacher training (e.g. pedagogical training) pre-service or in-service required for teaching at the relevant level in a given country” (Indicator 4.C.1)

According to a report from the U.N. Secretary-General on “Progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals” in 2018, [[official development assistance]] (ODA) for scholarships amounted to $1.2 billion in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Progress Towards the Sustainable Development Goals (English)|first=United Nations|publisher=United Nations Economic and Social Council|year=2018|isbn=|location=New York|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest contributors were Australia, France, the United Kingdom of Great Britain, Northern Ireland, and European Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bank|first=The World|date=2015-12-01|title=Incheon declaration : education 2030 - towards inclusive and equitable quality education and lifelong learning for all|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/167341467987876458/Incheon-declaration-education-2030-towards-inclusive-and-equitable-quality-education-and-lifelong-learning-for-all|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Education is a core aspect of the SDGs, and considered essential to their success.

There are different lenses international education can be viewed as. For example, thinking of international education in terms of a study abroad program that can help prepare students when looking for international occupations. Another example can be that international development is a focal point that is taught in colleges and universities under the umbrella of international education.

== Collaborative Online International Learning (COIL) ==
Although very successful programs such as [[Engineers Without Borders]]{{Example needed |s|date=June 2018}} enable students in one country to obtain an international education while working on [[open source appropriate technology]] projects abroad, the cost of this approach can be prohibitive for large scale replication. Recent, work has shown that using a virtual educational exchange, can have many of the positive benefits associated with international education and cross cultural experiences, without the prohibitive costs of overseas programs.&lt;ref&gt;Augusta Abrahamse, Mathew Johnson, Nanette Levinson, Larry Medsker, Joshua M.

==International Education Week==
International Education Week is held in the United States by the U.S. Department of State and U.S. Department of Education.  The choice of week for celebration is determined at each institution, but is generally the week before the week that includes [[Thanksgiving (United States)|U.S. Thanksgiving]]: {{Weekday after date|{{LASTYEAR}}|November|11|Monday|F j}}–{{Weekday after date|{{LASTYEAR}}|November|15|Friday|j, Y}}; {{Weekday after date|{{CURRENTYEAR}}|November|11|Monday|F j}}–{{Weekday after date|{{CURRENTYEAR}}|November|15|Friday|j, Y}}; {{Weekday after date|{{NEXTYEAR}}|November|11|Monday|F j}}–{{Weekday after date|{{NEXTYEAR}}|November|15|Friday|j, Y}}; {{Weekday after date|{{#expr:{{NEXTYEAR}}+1}}|November|11|Monday|F j}}–{{Weekday after date|{{#expr:{{NEXTYEAR}}+1}}|November|15|Friday|j, Y}}.&lt;ref name="DOS-week"&gt;[http://eca.state.gov/programs-initiatives/international-education-week United States Department of State: International Education Week]&lt;/ref&gt;  The aims of this event are to provide an opportunity to celebrate the benefits of international education and global exchange.This joint initiative promotes programs that prepare Americans for a global milieu and attract future leaders from abroad to study, learn and exchange experiences in the U.S. This shows how International education is not just about physically crossing borders, but is also about thinking globally in local situations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iew.state.gov International Education Week 2010].

==Challenges Facing International education==
{{globalize|section|USA|date=December 2017}}
International education has a somewhat unusual position in higher education.{{According to whom|date=June 2018}} While recognized as an important sphere of activity, it tends to be handled by administrative offices at the top of departments of languages and literature and international affairs. The scholars involved in international education usually have their primary involvement in other teaching and research.{{According to whom|date=June 2018}} This leads to four distinctive characteristics particular to the field of international education:&lt;ref&gt;Cummings, William.ERIC Clearinghouse on Higher Education Washington DC. Current Challenges of International Education. ERIC Digest.Publication Date: 2001-12-00&lt;/ref&gt;

# There is little consensus concerning the guiding theme of the field as well as its scope. Should the field stress internationalization, trans nationalization, or globalization?&lt;ref&gt;(Barrows, 2000; Committee for Transnational Competence, 2000; Hilary, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;
# International education is not a prominent feature of the contemporary higher education experience. Using enrollment in foreign languages as an indicator, 16 percent of all U.S. college students were enrolled in foreign languages in the peak period of the 1960s; the proportion is currently down to 8 percent (Hayward, 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;6).
# There is imbalance in regional coverage. The regions and languages covered at a particular institution are a function of idiosyncratic patterns of faculty recruitment. Nationally, there is reasonable coverage of Western Europe and Latin America and most European languages compared to limited coverage of Africa and the Middle East. For students enrolled in foreign languages, Spanish is the most popular followed by the other major languages of Western Europe; 6 percent enroll in Asian languages. Languages of the Middle East make up only 2 percent (1.3 being Hebrew and .5 percent Arabic). The languages of Africa constitute only 0.15 percent of enrollments.
# Because international education is not a primary concern of most scholars in the field, research is somewhat sporadic, non-cumulative, and tends to be carried out by national organizations as part of advocacy projects (e.g. Lambert, 1989; Brecht and Rivers, 2000). The most recent example is the American Council of Education's (ACE's) Internationalization of Higher Education: A Status Report. (Hayward, 2000). However, programs through various institutions, such as the [[Fulbright Program]] offer research opportunities for those wishing to study abroad.

Additionally, one of the challenges of international students is that increasingly higher education institutions are treating them as cash cows {{buzzword inline|date=June 2018}} for meeting their budget challenges. Institutions must do more to support international students in their academic and career success by providing advising, training and coaching that is culturally attuned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://resources.interedge.org/2016/03/05/higher-education-must-go-beyond-recruitment-and-immigration-compliance-of-international-students/|title=International Students are Paying More for Education; are Universities Doing Enough?|last=Hu|first=Di|date=2016-03-05|website=interEDGE.org}}&lt;/back&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="43134">In [[psychometrics]], '''item response theory''' ('''IRT''') (also known as '''latent trait theory''', '''strong true score theory''', or '''modern mental test theory''') is a paradigm for the design, analysis, and scoring of [[Test (student assessment)|tests]], [[questionnaire]]s, and similar instruments [[measurement|measuring]] abilities, attitudes, or other variables. It is a theory of testing based on the relationship between individuals' performances on a test item and the test takers' levels of performance on an overall measure of the ability that item was designed to measure. Several different statistical models are used to represent both item and test taker characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;National Council on Measurement in Education http://www.ncme.org/ncme/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary1.aspx?hkey=4bb87415-44dc-4088-9ed9-e8515326a061#anchorI {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170722194028/http://www.ncme.org/ncme/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary/NCME/Resource_Center/Glossary1.aspx?hkey=4bb87415-44dc-4088-9ed9-e8515326a061#anchorI |date=2017-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike simpler alternatives for creating scales and evaluating questionnaire responses, it does not assume that each item is equally difficult. This distinguishes IRT from, for instance, [[Likert scaling]], in which ''"''All items are assumed to be replications of each other or in other words items are considered to be parallel instruments"&lt;ref name="vanAlphen1994"&gt;A. van Alphen, R. Halfens, A. Hasman and T. Imbos. (1994). Likert or Rasch? Nothing is more applicable than good theory. ''Journal of Advanced Nursing''. '''20''', 196-201&lt;/ref&gt; (p.&amp;nbsp;197). By contrast, item response theory treats the difficulty of each item (the item characteristic curves, or [[#The_item_response_function|ICCs]]) as information to be incorporated in scaling items. 

It is based on the application of related [[mathematical model]]s to testing [[data]].  Because it is often regarded as superior to [[classical test theory]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Susan E. |last1=Embretson |first2=Steven P. |last2=Reise |title=Item Response Theory for Psychologists |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rYU7rsi53gQC |year=2000 |publisher=Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is the preferred method for developing scales in the United States,{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} especially when optimal decisions are demanded, as in so-called [[High-stakes testing|high-stakes tests]], e.g., the [[Graduate Record Examination]] (GRE) and [[Graduate Management Admission Test]] (GMAT).

The name ''item response theory'' is due to the focus of the theory on the item, as opposed to the test-level focus of classical test theory. Thus IRT models the response of each examinee of a given ability to each item in the test. The term ''item'' is generic, covering all kinds of informative items. They might be [[multiple choice]] questions that have incorrect and correct responses, but are also commonly statements on questionnaires that allow respondents to indicate level of agreement (a [[rating scale|rating]] or [[Likert scale]]), or patient symptoms scored as present/absent, or diagnostic information in complex systems.

IRT is based on the idea that the [[probability]] of a correct/keyed response to an item is a [[mathematical function]] of person and item [[parameters]]. The person parameter is construed as (usually) a single latent trait or dimension. Examples include general [[intelligence]] or the strength of an attitude. Parameters on which items are characterized include their difficulty (known as "location" for their location on the difficulty range); discrimination (slope or correlation), representing how steeply the rate of success of individuals varies with their ability; and a pseudoguessing parameter, characterising the (lower) [[asymptote]] at which even the least able persons will score due to guessing (for instance, 25% for pure chance on a multiple choice item with four possible responses).

In the same manner, IRT can be used to measure human behaviour in online social networks. The views expressed by different people can be aggregated to be studied using IRT. Its use in classifying information as  misinformation or true information has also been evaluated.

==Overview==
{{refimprove section|date=December 2015}}
The concept of the item response function was around before 1950.  The pioneering work of IRT as a theory occurred during the 1950s and 1960s.  Three of the pioneers were the [[Educational Testing Service]] psychometrician [[Frederic M.

Key figures who furthered the progress of IRT include [[Benjamin Drake Wright]] and [[David Andrich]]. IRT did not become widely used until the late 1970s and 1980s, when practitioners were told the "usefulness" and "advantages" of IRT on the one hand, and [[personal computer]]s gave many researchers access to the computing power necessary for IRT on the other.

Among other things, the purpose of IRT is to provide a framework for evaluating how well assessments work, and how well individual items on assessments work. The most common application of IRT is in education, where psychometricians use it for developing and designing [[Test (student assessment)|exams]], maintaining banks of items for exams, and [[equating]] the difficulties of items for successive versions of exams (for example, to allow comparisons between results over time).&lt;ref&gt;Hambleton, R. K., Swaminathan, H., &amp; Rogers, H. J. (1991). ''Fundamentals of Item Response Theory''. Newbury Park, CA: Sage Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

IRT models are often referred to as ''latent trait models''. The term ''latent'' is used to emphasize that discrete item responses are taken to be ''observable manifestations'' of hypothesized traits, constructs, or attributes, not directly observed, but which must be inferred from the manifest responses.  Latent trait models were developed in the field of sociology, but are virtually identical to IRT models.

IRT is generally claimed as an improvement over [[classical test theory]] (CTT).  For tasks that can be accomplished using CTT, IRT generally brings greater flexibility and provides more sophisticated information.  Some applications, such as [[Computer-adaptive test|computerized adaptive testing]], are enabled by IRT and cannot reasonably be performed using only classical test theory.  Another advantage of IRT over CTT is that the more sophisticated information IRT provides allows a researcher to improve the [[Reliability (psychometric)|reliability]] of an assessment.

IRT entails three assumptions:

#  A unidimensional trait denoted by &lt;math&gt;{\theta}&lt;/math&gt; ;
#  [[Local independence]] of items;
#  The response of a person to an item can be modeled by a mathematical ''item response function'' (IRF).

The trait is further assumed to be measurable on a scale (the mere existence of a test assumes this), typically set to a standard scale with a [[mean]] of 0.0 and a [[standard deviation]] of 1.0.  Unidimensionality should be interpreted as homogeneity, a quality that should be defined or empirically demonstrated in relation to a given purpose or use, but not a quantity that can be measured. 'Local independence' means (a) that the chance of one item being used is not related to any other item(s) being used and (b) that response to an item is each and every test-taker's independent decision, that is, there is no cheating or pair or group work.  The topic of dimensionality is often investigated with [[factor analysis]], while the IRF is the basic building block of IRT and is the center of much of the research and literature.

==The item response function==
The IRF gives the probability that a person with a given ability level will answer correctly. Persons with lower ability have less of a chance, while persons with high ability are very likely to answer correctly; for example, students with higher math ability are more likely to get a math item correct. The exact value of the probability depends, in addition to ability, on a set of ''item parameters'' for the IRF.

===Three parameter logistic model===
[[File:3PL IRF.png|220x220px|Figure 1: Example of 3PL IRF, with dotted lines overlaid to demonstrate parameters.|thumb]]
For example, in the '''three parameter logistic model''' ('''3PL'''), the probability of a correct response to a dichotomous item ''i'', usually a multiple-choice question,  is:

:&lt;math&gt;
p_i({\theta})=c_i + \frac{1-c_i}{1+e^{-a_i({\theta}-b_i)}}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;{\theta}&lt;/math&gt; indicates that the person abilities are modeled as a sample from a normal distribution for the purpose of estimating the item parameters. After the item parameters have been estimated, the abilities of individual person are estimated for reporting purposes. &lt;math&gt;a_i&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b_i&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt; are the item parameters. The item parameters determine the shape of the IRF. Figure 1 depicts an ideal 3PL ICC.

The item parameters can be interpreted as changing the shape of the standard [[logistic function]]:
:&lt;math&gt;P(t)=\frac{1}{1+e^{-t}}.&lt;/math&gt;
In brief, the parameters are interpreted as follows (dropping subscripts for legibility); ''b'' is most basic, hence listed first:
* ''b'' – difficulty, item location: &lt;math&gt;p(b) = (1+c)/2,&lt;/math&gt; the half-way point between &lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt; (min) and 1 (max), also where the slope is maximized.
* ''a'' – discrimination, scale, slope: the maximum slope &lt;math&gt;p'(b) = a \cdot (1-c)/4.&lt;/math&gt;
* ''c'' – pseudo-guessing, chance, asymptotic minimum &lt;math&gt;p(-\infty) = c.&lt;/math&gt;
If &lt;math&gt;c = 0,&lt;/math&gt; then these simplify to &lt;math&gt;p(b) = 1/2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p'(b) = a/4,&lt;/math&gt; meaning that ''b'' equals the 50% success level (difficulty), and ''a'' (divided by four) is the maximum slope (discrimination), which occurs at the 50% success level. Further, the [[logit]] (log [[odds]]) of a correct response is &lt;math&gt;a(\theta-b)&lt;/math&gt; (assuming &lt;math&gt;c=0&lt;/math&gt;): in particular if ability ''θ'' equals difficulty ''b,'' there are even odds (1:1, so logit 0) of a correct answer, the greater the ability is above (or below) the difficulty the more (or less) likely a correct response, with discrimination ''a'' determining how rapidly the odds increase or decrease with ability.

In other words, the standard logistic function has an asymptotic minimum of 0 (&lt;math&gt;c=0&lt;/math&gt;), is centered around 0 (&lt;math&gt;b = 0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;P(0) = 1/2&lt;/math&gt;), and has maximum slope &lt;math&gt;P'(0)=1/4.&lt;/math&gt; The &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; parameter stretches the horizontal scale, the &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; parameter shifts the horizontal scale, and the &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; compresses the vertical scale from &lt;math&gt;[0,1]&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;[c,1].&lt;/math&gt; This is elaborated below.

The parameter &lt;math&gt;b_i&lt;/math&gt; represents the item location which, in the case of attainment testing, is referred to as the item difficulty. It is the point on &lt;math&gt;{\theta}&lt;/math&gt; where the IRF has its maximum slope, and where the value is half-way between the minimum value of &lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt; and the maximum value of 1. The example item is of medium difficulty since &lt;math&gt;b_i&lt;/math&gt;=0.0, which is near the center of the distribution. Note that this model scales the item's difficulty and the person's trait onto the same continuum. Thus, it is valid to talk about an item being about as hard as Person A's trait level or of a person's trait level being about the same as Item Y's difficulty, in the sense that successful performance of the task involved with an item reflects a specific level of ability.

The item parameter &lt;math&gt;a_i&lt;/math&gt; represents the discrimination of the item: that is, the degree to which the item discriminates between persons in different regions on the latent continuum. This parameter characterizes the slope of the IRF where the slope is at its maximum. The example item has &lt;math&gt;a_i&lt;/math&gt;=1.0, which discriminates fairly well; persons with low ability do indeed have a much smaller chance of correctly responding than persons of higher ability.

For items such as [[multiple choice]] items, the parameter &lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt; is used in attempt to account for the effects of guessing on the probability of a correct response. It indicates the probability that very low ability individuals will get this item correct by chance, mathematically represented as a lower [[asymptote]]. A four-option multiple choice item might have an IRF like the example item; there is a 1/4 chance of an extremely low ability candidate guessing the correct answer, so the &lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt; would be approximately 0.25. This approach assumes that all options are equally plausible, because if one option made no sense, even the lowest ability person would be able to discard it, so IRT parameter estimation methods take this into account and estimate a &lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt; based on the observed data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bock |first1=R.D. |last2=Aitkin |first2=M. |title=Marginal maximum likelihood estimation of item parameters: application of an EM algorithm |journal=Psychometrika |volume=46 |issue=4 |pages=443–459 |year=1981 |doi=10.1007/BF02293801 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/c676744078511265/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==IRT models==
Broadly speaking, IRT models can be divided into two families: unidimensional and multidimensional.  Unidimensional models require a single trait (ability) dimension &lt;math&gt;{\theta}&lt;/math&gt;.  Multidimensional IRT models model response data hypothesized to arise from multiple traits.  However, because of the greatly increased complexity, the majority of IRT research and applications utilize a unidimensional model.

IRT models can also be categorized based on the number of scored responses.  The typical [[multiple choice]] item is ''dichotomous''; even though there may be four or five options, it is still scored only as correct/incorrect (right/wrong).  Another class of models apply to ''polytomous'' outcomes, where each response has a different score value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Remo |last1=Ostini |first2=Michael L. |last2=Nering |title=Polytomous Item Response Theory Models |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wS8VEMtJ3UYC |year=2005 |publisher=SAGE| isbn=978-0-7619-3068-6 |series=Quantitative Applications in the Social Sciences |volume=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Michael L. |editor1-last=Nering |editor2-first=Remo |editor2-last=Ostini |title=Handbook of polytomous item response theory models |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M2NYAAAAYAAJ |year=2010 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=978-0-8058-5992-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; A common example of this is [[Likert scale|Likert]]-type items, e.g., "Rate on a scale of 1 to 5."

===Number of IRT parameters===
Dichotomous IRT models are described by the number of parameters they make use of.&lt;ref&gt;Thissen, D. &amp; Orlando, M. (2001).  Item response theory for items scored in two categories.  In D. Thissen &amp; Wainer, H. (Eds.), ''Test Scoring'' (pp. 73-140).  Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;  The 3PL is named so because it employs three item parameters.  The two-parameter model (2PL) assumes that the data have no guessing, but that items can vary in terms of location (&lt;math&gt;b_i&lt;/math&gt;) and discrimination (&lt;math&gt;a_i&lt;/math&gt;).  The one-parameter model (1PL) assumes that guessing is a part of the ability and that all items that fit the model have equivalent discriminations, so that items are only described by a single parameter (&lt;math&gt;b_i&lt;/math&gt;). This results in one-parameter models having the property of specific objectivity, meaning that the rank of the item difficulty is the same for all respondents independent of ability, and that the rank of the person ability is the same for items independently of difficulty. Thus, 1 parameter models are sample independent, a property that does not hold for two-parameter and three-parameter models.  Additionally, there is theoretically a four-parameter model (4PL), with an upper [[asymptote]], denoted by &lt;math&gt;d_i,&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;1-c_i&lt;/math&gt; in the 3PL is replaced by &lt;math&gt;d_i-c_i&lt;/math&gt;.  However, this is rarely used.  Note that the alphabetical order of the item parameters does not match their practical or psychometric importance; the location/difficulty (&lt;math&gt;b_i&lt;/math&gt;) parameter is clearly most important because it is included in all three models.  The 1PL uses only &lt;math&gt;b_i&lt;/math&gt;, the 2PL uses &lt;math&gt;b_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a_i&lt;/math&gt;, the 3PL adds &lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt;, and the 4PL adds &lt;math&gt;d_i&lt;/math&gt;.

The 2PL is equivalent to the 3PL model with &lt;math&gt;c_i = 0&lt;/math&gt;, and is appropriate for testing items where guessing the correct answer is highly unlikely, such as fill-in-the-blank items ("What is the square root of 121?"), or where the concept of guessing does not apply, such as personality, attitude, or interest items (e.g., "I like Broadway musicals. Agree/Disagree").

The 1PL assumes not only that guessing is not present (or irrelevant), but that all items are equivalent in terms of discrimination, analogous to a common [[factor analysis]] with identical loadings for all items.  Individual items or individuals might have secondary factors but these are assumed to be mutually independent and collectively [[orthogonal]].

===Logistic and normal IRT models===
An alternative formulation constructs IRFs based on the normal probability distribution; these are sometimes called ''normal [[ogive (statistics)|ogive]] models''.  For example, the formula for a two-parameter normal-ogive IRF is:

:&lt;math&gt;
p_i(\theta)= \Phi \left( \frac{\theta-b_i}{\sigma_i} \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

where '''Φ''' is the [[cumulative distribution function]] (cdf) of the standard normal distribution.

The normal-ogive model derives from the assumption of normally distributed measurement error and is theoretically appealing on that basis. Here &lt;math&gt;b_i&lt;/math&gt; is, again, the difficulty parameter.  The discrimination parameter is &lt;math&gt;{\sigma}_i&lt;/math&gt;, the standard deviation of the measurement error for item ''i'', and comparable to 1/''&lt;math&gt;a_i&lt;/math&gt;.

One can estimate a normal-ogive latent trait model by factor-analyzing a matrix of tetrachoric correlations between items.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Gustav Jöreskog|K. G. Jöreskog]] and D. Sörbom(1988). ''PRELIS 1 user's manual, version 1''.  Chicago: Scientific Software, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;  This means it is technically possible to estimate a simple IRT model using general-purpose statistical software.

With rescaling of the ability parameter, it is possible to make the 2PL logistic model closely approximate the [[cumulative normal]] [[ogive]].  Typically, the 2PL logistic and normal-ogive IRFs differ in probability by no more than 0.01 across the range of the function. The difference is greatest in the distribution tails, however, which tend to have more influence on results.

The latent trait/IRT model was originally developed using normal ogives, but this was considered too computationally demanding for the computers at the time (1960s).  The logistic model was proposed as a simpler alternative, and has enjoyed wide use since.  More recently, however, it was demonstrated that, using standard polynomial approximations to the normal ''cdf,''&lt;ref&gt;Abramowitz M., Stegun I.A. (1972). ''Handbook of Mathematical Functions''. Washington DC: U. S. Government Printing Office.&lt;/ref&gt; the normal-ogive model is no more computationally demanding than logistic models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Uebersax |first=J.S. |title=Probit latent class analysis with dichotomous or ordered category measures: conditional independence/dependence models |journal=Applied Psychological Measurement |volume=23 |issue=4 |pages=283–297 |date=December 1999 |doi=10.1177/01466219922031400 |url=http://apm.sagepub.com/content/23/4/283.short}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Rasch model===
The [[Rasch model]] is often considered to be the 1PL IRT model.  However, proponents of Rasch modeling prefer to view it as a completely different approach to conceptualizing the relationship between data and theory.&lt;ref&gt;Andrich, D (1989), Distinctions between assumptions and requirements in measurement in the Social sciences", in Keats, J.A, Taft, R., Heath, R.A, Lovibond, S (Eds), ''Mathematical and Theoretical Systems'', Elsevier Science Publishers, North Holland, Amsterdam, pp.7-16.&lt;/ref&gt;  Like other statistical modeling approaches, IRT emphasizes the primacy of the fit of a model to observed data,&lt;ref&gt;Steinberg, J. (2000). Frederic Lord, Who Devised Testing Yardstick, Dies at 87.  New York Times, February 10, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; while the Rasch model emphasizes the primacy of the requirements for fundamental measurement, with adequate data-model fit being an important but secondary requirement to be met before a test or research instrument can be claimed to measure a trait.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Andrich |first=D. |title=Controversy and the Rasch model: a characteristic of incompatible paradigms? |journal=Medical Care |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=I–7 |date=January 2004 |pmid=14707751 |url=http://journals.lww.com/lww-medicalcare/Abstract/2004/01001/Controversy_and_the_Rasch_Model__A_Characteristic.2.aspx |doi=10.1097/01.mlr.0000103528.48582.7c}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Operationally, this means that the IRT approaches include additional model parameters to reflect the patterns observed in the data (e.g., allowing items to vary in their correlation with the latent trait), whereas in the Rasch approach, claims regarding the presence of a latent trait can only be considered valid when both (a) the data fit the Rasch model, and (b) test items and examinees conform to the model. Therefore, under Rasch models, misfitting responses require diagnosis of the reason for the misfit, and may be excluded from the data set if one can explain substantively why they do not address the latent trait.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Smith |first=R.M. |title=Theory and practice of fit |journal=Rasch Measurement Transactions |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=78 |year=1990 |url=http://rasch.org/rmt/rmt34b.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the Rasch approach can be seen to be a confirmatory approach, as opposed to exploratory approaches that attempt to model the observed data.  As in any confirmatory analysis, care must be taken to avoid [[confirmation bias]].

The presence or absence of a guessing or pseudo-chance parameter is a major and sometimes controversial distinction.  The IRT approach includes a left asymptote parameter to account for guessing in [[multiple choice]] examinations, while the Rasch model does not because it is assumed that guessing adds randomly distributed noise to the data. As the noise is randomly distributed, it is assumed that, provided sufficient items are tested, the rank-ordering of persons along the latent trait by raw score will not change, but will simply undergo a linear rescaling.  By contrast, three-parameter IRT achieves data-model fit by selecting a model that fits the data,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zwick |first1=R. |last2=Thayer |first2=D.T. |last3=Wingersky |first3=M. |title=Effect of Rasch calibration on ability and DIF estimation in computer-adaptive tests |journal=Journal of Educational Measurement |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=341–363 |date=December 1995 |doi=10.1111/j.1745-3984.1995.tb00471.x |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1745-3984.1995.tb00471.x/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the expense of sacrificing [[specific objectivity]].

In practice, the Rasch model has at least two principal advantages in comparison to the IRT approach.  The first advantage is the primacy of Rasch's specific requirements,&lt;ref&gt;Rasch, G. (1960/1980).  ''Probabilistic models for some intelligence and attainment tests''. (Copenhagen, Danish Institute for Educational Research), expanded edition (1980) with foreword and afterword by B.D. Wright.  Chicago: The University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; which (when met) provides ''fundamental'' person-free measurement (where persons and items can be mapped onto the same invariant scale).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wright |first=B.D. |title=IRT in the 1990s: Which Models Work Best? |journal=Rasch measurement transactions |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=196–200 |year=1992 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another advantage of the Rasch approach is that estimation of parameters is more straightforward in Rasch models due to the presence of sufficient statistics, which in this application means a one-to-one mapping of raw number-correct scores to Rasch &lt;math&gt;{\theta}&lt;/math&gt; estimates.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, G.H. &amp; Molenaar, I.W. (1995).  ''Rasch Models: Foundations, Recent Developments, and Applications''.  New York: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis of model fit==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2014}}
As with any use of mathematical models, it is important to assess the fit of the data to the model.  If item misfit with any model is diagnosed as due to poor item quality, for example confusing distractors in a multiple-choice test, then the items may be removed from that test form and rewritten or replaced in future test forms. If, however, a large number of misfitting items occur with no apparent reason for the misfit, the construct validity of the test will need to be reconsidered and the test specifications may need to be rewritten. Thus, misfit provides invaluable diagnostic tools for test developers, allowing the hypotheses upon which test specifications are based to be empirically tested against data.

There are several methods for assessing fit, such as a [[Chi-square statistic]], or a standardized version of it.  Two and three-parameter IRT models adjust item discrimination, ensuring improved data-model fit, so fit statistics lack the confirmatory diagnostic value found in one-parameter models, where the idealized model is specified in advance.

Data should not be removed on the basis of misfitting the model, but rather because a construct relevant reason for the misfit has been diagnosed, such as a non-native speaker of English taking a science test written in English. Such a candidate can be argued to not belong to the same population of persons depending on the dimensionality of the test, and, although one parameter IRT measures are argued to be sample-independent, they are not population independent, so misfit such as this is construct relevant and does not invalidate the test or the model. Such an approach is an essential tool in instrument validation. In two and three-parameter models, where the psychometric model is adjusted to fit the data, future administrations of the test must be checked for fit to the same model used in the initial validation in order to confirm the hypothesis that scores from each administration generalize to other administrations. If a different model is specified for each administration in order to achieve data-model fit, then a different latent trait is being measured and test scores cannot be argued to be comparable between administrations.

==Information==
One of the major contributions of item response theory is the extension of the concept of [[reliability (statistics)|reliability]].  Traditionally, reliability refers to the precision of measurement (i.e., the degree to which measurement is free of error).  Traditionally, it is measured using a single index defined in various ways, such as the ratio of true and observed score variance.  This index is helpful in characterizing a test's average reliability, for example in order to compare two tests.  But IRT makes it clear that precision is not uniform across the entire range of test scores.  Scores at the edges of the test's range, for example, generally have more error associated with them than scores closer to the middle of the range.

Item response theory advances the concept of item and test information to replace reliability.  Information is also a ''function'' of the model parameters. For example, according to [[Fisher information]] theory, the item information supplied in the case of the 1PL for dichotomous response data is simply the probability of a correct response multiplied by the probability of an incorrect response, or,

:&lt;math&gt;
I(\theta)=p_i(\theta) q_i(\theta).\,
&lt;/math&gt;

The [[standard error of estimation]] (SE) is the reciprocal of the test information of at a given trait level, is the

:&lt;math&gt;
\text{SE}(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{I(\theta)}}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus more information implies less error of measurement.

For other models, such as the two and three parameters models, the discrimination parameter plays an important role in the function. The item information function for the two parameter model is

:&lt;math&gt;
I(\theta)=a_i^2 p_i(\theta) q_i(\theta).\,
&lt;/math&gt;

The item information function for the three parameter model is

:&lt;math&gt;
I(\theta)=a_i^2 \frac{(p_i(\theta) - c_i)^2}{(1 - c_i)^2} \frac{q_i(\theta)}{p_i(\theta)}.
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
de Ayala, R.J. (2009). ''The Theory and Practice of Item Response Theory'', New York, NY: The Guilford Press. (6.12), p.144
&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, item information functions tend to look bell-shaped. Highly discriminating items have tall, narrow information functions; they contribute greatly but over a narrow range.  Less discriminating items provide less information but over a wider range.

Plots of item information can be used to see how much information an item contributes and to what portion of the scale score range.  Because of local independence, item information functions are [[additive map|additive]].  Thus, the test information function is simply the sum of the information functions of the items on the exam.  Using this property with a large item bank, test information functions can be shaped to control [[measurement error]] very precisely.

Characterizing the [[accuracy]] of test scores is perhaps the central issue in psychometric theory and is a chief difference between IRT and CTT. IRT findings reveal that the CTT concept of reliability is a simplification. In the place of reliability, IRT offers the test information function which shows the degree of precision at different values of theta, θ.

These results allow psychometricians to (potentially) carefully shape the level of reliability for different ranges of ability by including carefully chosen items. For example, in a [[certification]] situation in which a test can only be passed or failed, where there is only a single "cutscore," and where the actually passing score is unimportant, a very efficient test can be developed by selecting only items that have high information near the cutscore. These items generally correspond to items whose difficulty is about the same as that of the cutscore.

==Scoring==
The person parameter &lt;math&gt;{\theta}&lt;/math&gt; represents the magnitude of ''latent trait'' of the individual, which is the human capacity or attribute measured by the test.&lt;ref&gt;Lazarsfeld P.F, &amp; Henry N.W. (1968). ''Latent Structure Analysis''. Boston: Houghton Mifflin.&lt;/ref&gt;  It might be a cognitive ability, physical ability, skill, knowledge, attitude, personality characteristic, etc.

The estimate of the person parameter - the "score" on a test with IRT - is computed and interpreted in a very different manner as compared to traditional scores like number or percent correct.  The individual's total number-correct score is not the actual score, but is rather based on the IRFs, leading to a weighted score when the model contains item discrimination parameters.  It is actually obtained by multiplying the item response function for each item to obtain a ''likelihood function'', the highest point of which is the ''maximum likelihood estimate'' of &lt;math&gt;{\theta}&lt;/math&gt;.  This highest point is typically estimated with IRT software using the [[Newton-Raphson]] method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.assess.com/docs/Thompson_(2009)_-_Ability_estimation_with_IRT.pdf | title=Ability estimation with IRT |last=Thompson |first=N.A. |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While scoring is much more sophisticated with IRT, for most tests, the (linear) [[correlation]] between the theta estimate and a traditional score is very high; often it is .95 or more.  A graph of IRT scores against traditional scores shows an ogive shape implying that the IRT estimates separate individuals at the borders of the range more than in the middle.

An important difference between CTT and IRT is the treatment of measurement error, indexed by the [[standard error of measurement]].  All tests, questionnaires, and inventories are imprecise tools; we can never know a person's ''true score'', but rather only have an estimate, the ''observed score.'' There is some amount of random error which may push the observed score higher or lower than the true score.  CTT assumes that the amount of error is the same for each examinee, but IRT allows it to vary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kolen |first1=Michael J. |last2=Zeng |first2=Lingjia |last3=Hanson |first3=Bradley A. |title=Conditional Standard Errors of Measurement for Scale Scores Using IRT |journal=Journal of Educational Measurement |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=129–140 |date=June 1996 |doi=10.1111/j.1745-3984.1996.tb00485.x |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1745-3984.1996.tb00485.x/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, nothing about IRT refutes human development or improvement or assumes that a trait level is fixed.  A person may learn skills, knowledge or even so called "test-taking skills" which may translate to a higher true-score. In fact, a portion of IRT research focuses on the measurement of change in trait level.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, L.A., &amp; McDonald, J.L. (2000). ''[http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED441789&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=ED441789 Measuring Change in Teachers' Perceptions of the Impact that Staff Development Has on Teaching.]'' Paper presented at the Annual Meeting of the American Educational Research Association (New Orleans, LA, April 24–28, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

==A comparison of classical and item response theories==
[[Classical test theory]] (CTT) and IRT are largely concerned with the same problems but are different bodies of theory and entail different methods.  Although the two paradigms are generally consistent and complementary, there are a number of points of difference:

*IRT makes stronger assumptions than CTT and in many cases provides correspondingly stronger findings; primarily, characterizations of error. Of course, these results only hold when the assumptions of the IRT models are actually met.
*Although CTT results have allowed important practical results, the model-based nature of IRT affords many advantages over analogous CTT findings.
*CTT test scoring procedures have the advantage of being simple to compute (and to explain) whereas IRT scoring generally requires relatively complex estimation procedures.
*IRT provides several improvements in scaling items and people. The specifics depend upon the IRT model, but most models scale the difficulty of items and the ability of people on the same metric. Thus the difficulty of an item and the ability of a person can be meaningfully compared.
*Another improvement provided by IRT is that the parameters of IRT models are generally not sample- or test-dependent whereas true-score is defined in CTT in the context of a specific test. Thus IRT provides significantly greater flexibility in situations where different samples or test forms are used. These IRT findings are foundational for computerized adaptive testing.

It is worth also mentioning some specific similarities between CTT and IRT which help to understand the correspondence between concepts. First, Lord&lt;ref&gt;Lord, F.M. (1980). ''Applications of item response theory to practical testing problems''. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; showed that under the assumption that &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is normally distributed, discrimination in the 2PL model is approximately a [[monotonic function]] of the [[Point-biserial correlation coefficient|point-biserial correlation]]. In particular:

:&lt;math&gt;
a_i \cong \frac{\rho_{it}}{\sqrt{1-\rho_{it}^2}}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\rho_{it}&lt;/math&gt; is the point biserial correlation of item ''i''. Thus, if the assumption holds, where there is a higher discrimination there will generally be a higher point-biserial correlation.

Another similarity is that while IRT provides for a standard error of each estimate and an information function, it is also possible to obtain an index for a test as a whole which is directly analogous to [[Cronbach's alpha]], called the ''separation index''.  To do so, it is necessary to begin with a decomposition of an IRT estimate into a true location and error, analogous to decomposition of an observed score into a true score and error in CTT.  Let

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{\theta} = \theta + \varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the true location, and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is the error association with an estimate.  Then &lt;math&gt;\mbox{SE}({\theta})&lt;/math&gt; is an estimate of the standard deviation of &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; for person with a given weighted score and the separation index is obtained as follows

:&lt;math&gt;
R_\theta = \frac{\text{var}[\theta]}{\text{var}[\hat{\theta}]} = \frac{\text{var} [\hat{\theta}] - \text{var}[\epsilon]}{\text{var}[\hat{\theta}]}
&lt;/math&gt;

where the mean squared standard error of person estimate gives an estimate of the variance of the errors, &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_n&lt;/math&gt;, across persons. The standard errors are normally produced as a by-product of the estimation process.  The separation index is typically very close in value to Cronbach's alpha.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Andrich |first=D. |title=An index of person separation in latent trait theory, the traditional KR.20 index, and the Guttman scale response pattern |journal=Education Research and Perspectives |volume=9 |issue= |pages=95–104 |year=1982 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

IRT is sometimes called ''strong true score theory'' or ''modern mental test theory'' because it is a more recent body of theory and makes more explicit the hypotheses that are implicit within CTT.

A '''lecture''' (from the French 'lecture', meaning 'reading' [process]) is an oral [[presentation]] intended to present information or teach people about a particular subject, for example by a [[university]] or [[college]] [[teacher]]. Lectures are used to convey critical information, history, background, theories, and equations. A politician's speech, a minister's sermon, or even a businessman's sales presentation may be similar in form to a lecture.  Usually the lecturer will stand at the front of the room and recite information relevant to the lecture's content.

Though lectures are much criticised as a [[teaching method]], universities have not yet found practical alternative teaching methods for the large majority of their courses.&lt;ref name=cirtl /&gt;  Critics point out that lecturing is mainly a one-way method of [[communication]] that does not involve significant audience participation but relies upon [[passive learning]].  Therefore, lecturing is often contrasted to [[active learning]]. Lectures delivered by talented speakers can be highly stimulating; at the very least, lectures have survived in [[academia]] as a quick, cheap, and efficient way of introducing large numbers of students to a particular field of study.

Lectures have a significant role outside the classroom, as well. Academic and scientific awards routinely include a lecture as part of the honor, and academic conferences often center on "[[keynote|keynote addresses]]", i.e., lectures. The [[public lecture]] has a long history in the sciences and in [[social movement]]s. [[Hiring hall|Union halls]], for instance, historically have hosted numerous free and public lectures on a wide variety of matters. Similarly, [[Local church|churches]], [[Community centre|community center]]s, [[library|libraries]], [[museum]]s, and other organizations have hosted lectures in furtherance of their missions or their constituents' interests. Lectures represent a continuation of [[oral tradition]] in contrast to textual communication in books and other media. Lectures may be considered a type of [[grey literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://greynet.org/greysourceindex/documenttypes.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-05-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603045435/http://greynet.org/greysourceindex/documenttypes.html |archivedate=2016-06-03 |df= }} GreyNet International, Document Types in Grey Literature&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
[[File:Golan levin.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Golan Levin]] lecturing using a projected side]]
The noun "lecture" dates from 14th century, meaning "action of reading, that which is read," from the [[Latin]] ''lectus'', pp. of ''legere'' "to read." Its subsequent meaning as "oral discourse on a given subject before an audience for purposes of [[Education|instruction]]" is from the 16th century. The verb "to lecture" is attested from 1590.
The noun "lectern" refers to the reading desk used by lecturers.

==History==
The practice in the [[medieval university]] was for the instructor to read from an original source to a class of students who took notes on the lecture. The reading from original sources evolved into the reading of glosses on an original and then more generally to lecture notes. Throughout much of history, the diffusion of knowledge via handwritten lecture notes was an essential element of academic life.

[[File:Rembrandt - The Anatomy Lesson of Dr Nicolaes Tulp.jpg|upright=1.3|thumb|Rembrandt's ''The Anatomy Lecture of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp'']]
Even in the twentieth century, the lecture notes taken by students, or prepared by a scholar for a lecture, have sometimes achieved wide circulation (see, for example, the genesis of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]'s ''Cours de linguistique générale'').  Many lecturers were, and still are, accustomed to simply reading their own notes from the lectern for exactly that purpose. Nevertheless, modern lectures generally incorporate additional activities, e.g. writing on a chalk-board, exercises, class questions and discussions, or student presentations.

The use of [[multimedia]] presentation software such as [[Microsoft PowerPoint]] has changed the form of lectures, e.g. video, graphics, websites, or prepared exercises may be included. Most commonly, however, only outlines composed of "bullet points" are presented.  Critics such as [[Edward Tufte]]  contend that this style of lecture bombards the audience with unnecessary and possibly distracting or confusing graphics.&lt;ref&gt;Tufte, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

A modified lecture format, generally presented in 5 to 15 minute short segments, is now commonly presented as video, for example in [[massive open online course]]s (MOOCs) or in programs such as the [[Khan Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ted.com/talks/daphne_koller_what_we_re_learning_from_online_education.html Daphne Koller, ''What we're learning from online education''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120804030308/http://www.ted.com/talks/daphne_koller_what_we_re_learning_from_online_education.html |date=2012-08-04 }}, June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
[[File:Hogarth lecture 1736.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.3|[[William Hogarth]]'s 1736 [[engraving]], 
''Scholars at a Lecture'']]
Bligh, in ''What's the Use of Lectures?'', argues that lectures "represent a conception of education in which teachers who know give knowledge to students who do not and are therefore supposed to have nothing worth contributing."  Based on his review of numerous studies, he concludes that lecturing is as effective, but not more effective, as any other teaching method in transmitting information.  Nevertheless, lecturing is not the most effective method for promoting student thought, changing attitudes, or teaching behavioral skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url = https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/files/?whdmsaction=public:main.file&amp;fileID=8113| title = Natural Learning in Higher Education| author = J. Scott Armstrong| journal = Encyclopedia of the Sciences of Learning| year = 2012| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140916150012/https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/files/?whdmsaction=public:main.file&amp;fileID=8113| archivedate = 2014-09-16| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Bligh summarises research on memory to show the significance of the meaningfulness of material on retention (Marks and Miller 1964) and the importance of immediate rehearsal of information (Bassey 1968).  He relates his own research on arousal during lectures to suggest a decrement in attention during the first 25 minutes.  Lloyd (1968) and Scerbo et al. (1992) showed that students take less and less notes as lectures proceed. Bligh shows that after a short break filled by buzz group discussion, attention will recover somewhat. 
The largest section of Bligh's book is devoted to lecturing technique, particularly the organisation of lectures, how to make a point, the effectiveness of taking notes, the use of handouts, and ways of obtaining feedback.
Early editions of the book contained a reply paid evaluation card. This research showed that the section on alternative teaching methods within lectures was the most highly praised.&lt;ref name=Bligh&gt;{{cite book|last=Bligh|first=Donald|title=What's the use of lectures?|year=1998|edition=5th|publisher=Intellect Books|isbn=9781871516791|pages=316|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l-xxxqZXUU8C}} [http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic38998.files/Bligh_Ch1_and_Ch3.pdf Ch.1 and Ch. 3 reprint] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011213244/http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic38998.files/Bligh_Ch1_and_Ch3.pdf |date=2014-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conception of the lecture as needing to be a didactic event has been challenged by Meltzer and Manivannan (2002) and Sandry (2005) who maintain that lectures can involve active learning.&lt;ref name="byrne"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275637847_Using_Technology_to_Prevent_Plagiarism_Skilling_the_Students|title=Using Technology to Prevent Plagiarism: Skilling the Students|first1=Christopher|last1=Ireland|first2=Gillian|last2=Byrne|date=29 April 2015|publisher=|via=ResearchGate|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170831175516/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275637847_Using_Technology_to_Prevent_Plagiarism_Skilling_the_Students|archivedate=31 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Elliot (2005) sees difficulties in the encouragement of active learning with phenomena such as [[social loafing]] and [[Evaluation apprehension model|evaluation apprehension]] causing audience members to be reluctant to participate.&lt;ref name=byrne/&gt; A possible solution to the encouragement of audience involvement in lectures is the use of an [[Audience response#Use in Educational Settings|audience response system]] which allows audience members to participate anonymously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/02602938.2015.1024199 | volume=41 | title=Academic integrity: a quantitative study of confidence and understanding in students at the start of their higher education | journal=Assessment &amp; Evaluation in Higher Education | pages=482–497}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advantages===
The effectiveness of traditional lecture is and has been debated. Some advantages of lecturing include: quick exposure to new material, greater teacher control in the classroom, an engaging format, which may complement and clarify course material, and facilitating large-class communication.&lt;ref name=cirtl /&gt;  Lecturing also permits the dissemination of unpublished or not readily available material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Advantages &amp; Disadvantages of Lecturing|url=http://www.southalabama.edu/languages/spanish/TRG/TRG/Enhancing_Learning/Lecturing/advantages.htm|website=TeachingResourcesGuide.com|publisher=South Alabama University|accessdate=4 March 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402112936/http://www.southalabama.edu/languages/spanish/TRG/TRG/Enhancing_Learning/Lecturing/advantages.htm|archivedate=2 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disadvantages===
There has been much debate as to whether or not lecturing actually improves student learning in the classroom.  Commonly cited disadvantages of lecture include: placing students in a passive (rather than an active) role, encouraging one-way communication, requiring significant out-of-class time for students to engage with the material, and requiring the speaker to possess effective speaking skills.&lt;ref name=cirtl&gt;{{cite web|title=Lecturing: Advantages and Disadvantages of the Traditional Lecture Method|url=http://www.cirtl.net/node/2570|publisher=CIRTL Network|accessdate=11 March 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311181116/http://www.cirtl.net/node/2570|archivedate=11 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The criticisms of lectures are often summarized by a quote generally misattributed&lt;ref name=notes2notes/&gt; to [[Mark Twain]]:
{{quote|College is a place where a professor’s lecture notes go straight to the students’ lecture notes, without passing through the brains of either.&lt;ref name=notes2notes&gt;{{cite web|title=The Professor’s Lecture Notes Go Straight to the Students’ Lecture Notes|url=http://quoteinvestigator.com/2012/08/17/lecture-minds/|work=Quote Investigator|accessdate=April 19, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502201823/http://quoteinvestigator.com/2012/08/17/lecture-minds/|archivedate=May 2, 2013|df=}}. This source suggests that [[Edwin Slosson]] is more likely the original writer.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Other forms==
[[File:Civil Brainbar (1).jpg|thumb|Civil lecture at Budapest Brainbar]]
While lecturing is generally accepted as an effective form of instruction, there have been some prominent educators who have succeeded without the help of lectures.

Many [[university]] courses relying on lectures supplement them with smaller discussion sections, [[tutorial]]s, or laboratory experiment sessions as a means of further actively involving students. Often these supplemental sections are led by [[Postgraduate education|graduate student]]s, [[tutor]]s, [[teaching assistant]]s, or teaching [[fellow]]s rather than senior [[Faculty (division)|faculty]]. Those other forms of academic teaching include [[Conversation|discussion]] ([[recitation]] if conducted by a teaching assistant), [[seminar]]s, [[Training workshop|workshop]]s, [[observation]], practical application, [[case example]]s/[[case study]], [[experiential learning]]/[[active learning]], [[computer]]-based instruction, and [[tutorial]]s. 
  
In [[school]]s, the prevalent mode of student-teacher interaction is [[lesson]]s.

The term "[[Parlour|parlor]] lecture" gained currency throughout the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth of Nations]] and the [[United States|United States of America]] during the mid-19th century.  It referred to the custom of inviting noted speakers to deliver private lectures, which were typically hosted in the parlors of wealthy and socially influential families.&lt;ref&gt;[http://people.virginia.edu/~rmf8a/gaskell/EveningP.htm Gaskell's Compendium] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202172539/http://people.virginia.edu/~rmf8a/gaskell/EveningP.htm |date=2008-12-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Measurement is derived from the verb 'to measure' which means to assess something; in Arabic 'yaqees' 'measure' has the meaning of comparing something to something else. In this sense, measurement is a daily practice that manifests itself in all our assessment activities, whether we assess concrete things in terms of size and color, or abstract things such as human relations. The ultimate goal of 'measuring' something is to assess ourselves in comparison to everything else in the world.

Some of measurement areas include measuring the level or standard of knowledge nationwide or measuring the standard of a particular sect of the whole population or measuring for licensing or admission purposes in [[university education]], [[Vocational education|vocational]] or [[technical education]], for example. Measurement can never be done without well-recognized and approved criteria. We use the '[[meter]]', for example, as the measuring unit for distance and use '[[gram]]' unit for weight and '[[hour]]' unit for time and so on.

Scientifically speaking, there have been numerous definitions of 'measurement' that vary depending on the measured object and the set criteria, goals and controls of measurement.
Measurement varies based on:
* evaluating things in quantitative terms and in a graded manner based on the well-known rule that everything exists in quantities and every quantity is measurable.
* representing properties in numerical terms based on certain rules.
* measuring some mental processes and psychological traits  via a group of stimuli especially set to do quantitative  and qualitative evaluation.

Assessment simply means to evaluate something, and in scientific terms it refers to the process of passing judgment to evaluate capacity, knowledge, actions, solutions, methods, materials, etc. This is often done by applying certain criteria and standards to check adequacy, accuracy and effectiveness. In other words, evaluation means to give something a value based on approved standards. In the educational field, assessment refers to testing students' achievement and how far is obtained relative to some known educational objectives or goals. Measurement and assessment are so related and integrated.

The test developing process goes through a number of steps, which  includes theoretical and practical aspect. After the tests are formulated, they are subjected to examinations and testing through a specialized arbitrary committee, and prior to the final approval, the test are revised by a specialized committee, that consists of four experts.

==Stages of test and question construction==

Test construction is based upon practical and scientific rules that are applied before, during and after each item until it finally becomes a part of the test.  The following are the stages of constructing a test as followed by the Center.

===Preparation===
Each year the Center attracts a number of competent specialists in testing and educationalists to receive training in workshops that deal with the theoretical and applied aspects of the test. The theoretical aspects include:

# the concepts on which a test is constructed
# the  goals and objectives of the test.
# the general components , parts  and sections of a test
# the theoretical and technical foundations of test building.

Applied training includes:
# discussing different types of test items. This aims at putting theoretical and technical concepts into practice.
# collective training on writing items for various parts of the test
# constructing items on  individual basis  (outside workshops) which  is intended as peer teaching.

===Test writing===
*	Each test writer is charged with making questions that are relevant to his/her specialty.
*	Each test writer is given a code number that carries his/her personal data for confidentiality.
*	Each item is given a code number that is kept intact. Each item is in the question bank even if it is not to be used in the test.

===Arbitration===

Various items of the test are arbitrated by a 3-member committee:
 
# a specialist in the content area.
# a specialist in measurement
# an experienced educator.

Each item is either:
# accepted as is, or
# accepted after modifications, or
# rejected as invalid.

Based on a set questionnaire the committee judge each item from various dimensions including the nature of the item, item difficulty, item conformity to the content controls, item bias, and item quality. Justifications have to be provided if an item is deemed invalid. All data is entered into the Center's computer.

===Item entry===

All items are entered into the computer marked with the relevant arbitration judgment except  those  deemed invalid or incorrigible.

===Review===
All the computerized items are reviewed by four testing experts to verify:

# strict implementation of arbitration committee comments.
# accuracy of numbers and graphs.
# no grammatical, spelling errors or misprints.
# full compliance of items to the test pre-set standards and regulations.
# answer key is provided for all test items.
# screening out the items that seem too complicated or might take  too much time to answer.

===Item trial (pilot testing)===

Trial items are included in the actual test and they go through the same stages of test preparation above, but they do not calculate towards the final score.

===Item analysis===

Items are statistically analyzed so that the valid ones are selected for the test, while the invalid ones are rejected.

===Test construction===

Test is constructed in its final form. Items are randomly selected from those deposited in the question bank in a manner that adequately represents that various parts of test dimensions.

===Test production===

The test is finally produced. Trial questions are included and various versions of the test are prepared to avoid cheating. The test is printed in booklets that include test instructions and test items.

===Equivalence of various test versions===

The Center produces multiple versions of the same test. However, the Center has been cautious about discrepancies between various versions of the test in terms of difficulty, discrimination or content. An equivalence check  is run during test construction based on scientific criteria to ensure test discrimination and differential capacity. Although it is more accurate to run equivalence test during construction stage, equivalence criterion is applied during and after the test.

==Giftedness and Creativity Assessment (Mawhiba)==

'''Objectives:'''

The Objectives of this test is to detect the student’s potential abilities and academic skills in the fields of Language, Mathematics, Science, and some creativity aspects, given to it by a series of dimensions, sections, styles, and images.

#	9th grade.

==Educational tests==

===General Aptitude Test (GAT)===
'''Objectives''' 

This test measures a student's analytical and deductive skills. It focuses on testing the student's capacity for learning in general regardless of any specific skill in a certain subject or topic. The test measures abilities relevant to:
#	reading comprehension
#	recognizing logical relations
#	solving problems based on  basic mathematical notions.
#	inference skills
#	measuring capacity

'''GAT Sections'''

The test is divided into two sections, the verbal and the  quantitative.
A.	The verbal section. This section includes the following.

#	Reading comprehension. Testees are required to comprehend and analyze reading passages by answering the questions given.
#	Sentence completion.  Testees are asked to fill in the missing parts in the text to make complete meaningful sentences.
#	Verbal analogy. Testees are required to match the relation between a pair of words given at the beginning of the question and a pair given in the choices.
#	Synonymy. Testees are asked to give a synonym that matches the meaning of the word give.

B.	The quantitative Section

This section includes suitable mathematical problems that match General Secondary Schools Science and humanities majors. It focuses on measurements, inference and problem solving skills and requires only basic knowledge. The questions are divided as follows:

:{| class="wikitable"
| Arithmetic questions ||  40%
|-
| Geometry questions || 24%
|-
| Algebra questions  ||  23%
|-
| Statistices and analytical questions || 13%
|-
|}

As for the humanities-major students, GAT includes 30 questions on arithmetic ,geometry and mathematical analysis.

'''Test duration'''

The test normally takes two and half hours, divided on 25-minute intervals for each of the six test parts.

'''Results'''

Answer sheets are machine-graded and results are listed and printed and then announced. A student can receive GAT score via the Center's website or through an SMS for those registered for this service. Results are electronically sent to universities and colleges. For student who did the test more than once, only the highest score is sent. GAT is not a Pass-Fail test. The recorded score that the student receives represents the relevant position that the student occupies among the total number of students taking the test. Every higher education institution in Saudi Arabia has its own method of interpreting the relevant weight of GAT vs. General Secondary School final score. Competition in university admission is then based on the combined total scores of the GAT and General Secondary School in addition to the score obtained in any achievement test administered by the university (if required).

'''Is GAT a Pass/Fail test?'''

As noted above, GAT is no Pass/Fail test. This 100-point test carries a certain relative weight interpreted by the institution the student applies for. GAT score should not be compared to that of General Secondary School score. What really matters is the relevant position of the student compared to those of other students, according to the following table:

:{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
! Score
! Student's Position
|-
| 81 and above
| Top 5%

=== Language Tests ===

:Language tests are part of the assessment and measurement tests provided by the center through an unbiased objective approach, where the center provides the Standardized Test for English proficiency (STEP) as well as the Arabic Language test for non-native speakers, to serve academic institutions such as schools and colleges, that work on attracting qualified students.

==== Standardized Test for English Proficiency (STEP) ====
:This test is designed to measure objectively the student's proficiency in English. The test is made up of 100 questions and some other trial questions that do not add up to the final total score. The following are the various parts of the test and their perspective percentages:
:{| class="wikitable"
|-
| Reading  Comprehension || 40%
|-
| Sentence Structure || 30%
|-
| Listening Comprehension || 20%
|-
| Composition Analysis || 10%
|}
   	            	  	       	
:'''STEP serves as:'''
:#An admission test for students applying for English departments in the university
:#A verification tool for students' exemption from certain courses in English language programs (course waiver).
:#A placement test for  English departments applicants.
:#A measuring instrument of English language proficiency for students seeking to apply for teaching positions , higher studies, business or any other professional field.

:'''Students eligible to sit for STEP:'''

:#Students applying for English departments in the university.
:#Students applying for English departments and wishing to be placed according to their relevant proficiency level.
:#Students seeking an exemption from studying English courses in their respective programs.
:#Students applying for post-graduate studies.

:#Test items are Multiple Choice type. Each question is followed by four possible answers (A, B, C, D). He/she is asked to choose the right answer.
:#Total time allowed for the test is three hours including instructions given before the actual test.

:'''Tests times:'''
::This test is presented three times every year, the test times are on the center's website.

====Arabic Language Test for Non-Native Speakers====
:This test is designed to measure the non-native speaking student’s proficiency in the Arabic language.

*'''Reasons to develop this test:'''
::Standardized tests are considered an evaluation and assessment tools, that reflects the development and advancement of societies; because it is usually created due to the need of attracting qualified individuals by the society’s sectors and institutions. These institutions often prove their efficiency through the means of having their employees pass certain curtain assessment tests, which are based on scientific and objective standards. It is curtain that teaching the Arabic language to non-native speakers has gone a long way in accumulating experience and success, and it well known that there is a need for an efficient and an objective way to assess the proficiency of a language for non-native speakers. When it came to choosing process amongst the non-native speakers in some programs, it is usually done through the criteria of competitiveness, the existence of a standardized test that facilitates the selection process proved to be essential. These test should also be developed by a specialized institution in the field of assessment. Thus, this specialized test has become the topping of the accumulated knowledge and long experience in teaching the Arabic language, it also adds a new dimension and an element of maturity and success to the process.

*'''Students eligible to sit for this test:'''
::Perhaps the most beneficiary of this test are the academic establishments, whether it be schools, institutions, and universities, that seeks to attract non-native speaking students. For a long time, Arabic universities has been keen on attracting a large number of non-native speaking students. There are also other universities in the world that adopted similar approaches in accepting students seeking to study the Arabic language or to study other sciences using the Arabic language.
::This test could be used in the following:
::#Joining a language program or academic tracks that require a certain level of proficiency in the language.
::#Exemption from certain academic requirements.
::#Joining jobs that require knowledge in Arabic language.
::#Document the student’s language level while studying and after.

*'''Targeted language proficiency level:'''
::This test measures the student’s efficiency and skills in listening, reading, and writing using standard Arabic. In general, the test concentrates on the academic part of the language more than the other communication skills. Hence, it is more in sync with the programs that are available in Arabic countries, it also helps in connecting the student to the current culture of the Arab world.

::The Test consists of the following skillset:	
:::{| class="wikitable"
|-
| Reading comprehension || 40%
|-
| Writing || 35%
|-
| Listening comprehension || 25%
|}

::The test is divided into 6 parts, every part is 25 minutes long.

*'''Test Consistency:'''
::The consistency of the Arabic Language Test for Non-Native Speakers in its first draft 0.94; which means that this test has a high [[Internal consistency|consistency rate]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2258">The '''Nordic Summer University''' (NSU) is a [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] research network funded through the [[Nordic Council of Ministers]], organizing study circles in the social and human sciences, mainly for PhD students or post-doctoral scholars from the Nordic countries. The activity is organized in a maximum of ten study circles. Separate winter seminars are held for each study circle, and a more extensive summer conference is organised for all the study circles, in a different location within the Nordic countries each year. 

The [[Interdisciplinary#Interdisciplinary studies|interdisciplinary]] groups in the circles meet twice a year in order to discuss a wide range of topics, primarily within the [[Humanities|humanistic]] and the [[social sciences]]. During the main summer event, all circles join for a week of academic discussion. The activities are sponsored by the Nordic Council, with financial oversight performed by [[Foreningerne NORDENs Forbund]] (FNF).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nordic.university&lt;/ref&gt; One of the NSU sponsorship items is funding to 140-150 scholars each year in order to offset the costs associated with their participation in the joint sessions. 

The study circles have been conducted for more than 60 years and have in the past involved debates between several leading intellectuals, politicians, and scholars of the Nordic countries, including [[Niels Bohr]], [[Johan Fjord Jensen]], [[Mauno Koivisto]], [[Johan Galtung]], [[Jostein Gripsrud]], and [[Horace Engdahl]]. The focus of the research network is interdisciplinary and multicultural. In its statutes, NSU states that it is committed to introducing foreign ideas and influences that not yet have a foothold in the region's universities. 

NSU has a publishing house, NSU Press, with distribution secured through [[Århus University]] Press.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unipress.dk&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17201">'''Oppositional culture''', also known as the ‘’blocked opportunities framework’’ or the “caste theory of education”, is a term most commonly used in studying the [[sociology of education]] to explain [[racial achievement gap in the United States|racial disparities in educational achievement]], particularly between white and black Americans. However, the term refers to any subculture's rejection of conformity to prevailing norms and values, not just nonconformity within the educational system. Thus many criminal [[gang]]s and religious [[cult]]s could also be considered oppositional cultures.

==Background==
This theory relates to a larger generalized topic of [[race and intelligence]]. According to this theory, minority students underachieve intentionally in school and in standardized testing due to a fear of being stereotyped as [[acting white]].&lt;ref name ="Macombe"&gt;Mocombe, Paul, and Carol Tomlin. The Oppositional Culture Theory. Lanham, MD: University of America, 2010. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Acting white refers to activities and attitudes associated with white middle-class Americans. Adherence to white norms in African American communities represents a betrayal of black normative culture. Spurred by the pre-existing theories including the [[culture of poverty]] and the effects of [[urban decay]], oppositional culture emerged in the late 1970s as a theory to explain the education gap.  The principal researcher of this idea, anthropologist John Ogbu, details the principal mechanisms and causes for oppositional culture in his book, “Black Students in an Affluent Suburb, and Minority Status, Oppositional Culture, and Schooling”.

==Historical context==
Racial disparities in education stem from the historical foundations of America, from the époque of slavery into the 20th and 21st centuries. Slave owners in the American South by and large prevented their slaves from becoming literate, fearing that literacy and education would strengthen slave resistance and empower the slaves to revolt against their masters. While African-Americans in the North fared better, black schools struggled to keep their doors open.&lt;ref&gt;The Slave Experience: Education, Arts, and Culture." PBS. PBS, 2004. Web. 16 Apr. 2012. &lt;https://www.pbs.org/wnet/slavery/experience/education/history2.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1896 landmark court case, ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'' also helped to define education policies in the United States for years to come. The court case ultimately decided that race was an acceptable categorization by which to divide individuals.  Additionally the case determined that separation of these individuals was permissible provided that the condition of both facilities was equal.&lt;ref&gt;"Plessy v. Ferguson." Legal Information Institute. Cornell University Law School, 18 Apr. 1896. Web. 16 Apr. 2012. &lt;https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0163_0537_ZO.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  This case helped to promote segregationist practices that prevented African American children from attending white schools.  African-American schools had fewer resources leading to greater racial gaps in educational achievement.

In 1954, the Supreme Court decided that the concept of separate but equal was unconstitutional in its landmark decision in [[Brown v. Board of Education|''Brown vs. Topeka Board of Education'' 347 U.S. 483]].  The court also ruled that segregation inherently caused harm to the cognitive development of black children, and officially recognized the importance of educational equality as a compelling interest in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;"Brown v. Board of Education." Legal Information Institute. Cornell University Law School. Web. 02 Apr. 2012. &lt;https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0347_0483_ZS.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Following this ruling, Southern school districts began to publish findings of racial gaps in academics as a justification to oppose [[desegregation]].  As a result, the United States adopted compensatory education in order to equalize educational opportunities for all students.&lt;ref name="ogbu"&gt;Ogbu, John U. Black American Students in an Affluent Suburb: A Study of Academic Disengagement. Mahwah, NJ: L. Erlbaum Associates, 2003. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite these efforts, the education gap continues to persist in SAT scores and college acceptance rates.  In the 1980s, a researcher named [[John Ogbu]] suggested that equal opportunity was not enough to diminish the racial disparities gap in education and that additional factors needed to be addressed in order to reduce the racial disparities gap.

==Racial disparities in education today==

Racial disparities continue to persist in the realm of education even today.  A study by George Farkas in 2002 identifies several areas where racial gaps and disparities continue to exist. His research findings show that even in early primary education in pre-school and kindergarten, African American children show lower oral language, pre-reading, and pre-mathematics skills in addition to behavior less suited to school environments.&lt;ref&gt;Farkas, George. RACIAL DISPARITIES AND DISCRIMINATION IN EDUCATION: WHAT DO WE KNOW, HOW DO WE KNOW IT, AND WHAT DO WE NEED TO KNOW? Department of Sociology and Population Research Institute, 1 July 2002. Web. 16 Apr. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In high schools, measures of academic achievement such as grades and class rank also show an under-representation of African American and Hispanics. Additionally, African American and Latino students consistently perform lower on the SAT than their white counterparts thereby affecting their acceptance rates into universities. Even when accounting for differences in socioeconomic status and single parent households this racial disparity, although reduced, continues to exist.&lt;ref&gt;Hoover, Nichelle. Cultural Disparities of SAT Scores and the Influence on Higher Education Opportunities for African American and Latino Students. Education Resources Information Center. Dominican University of California, 1 Dec. 2007. Web. 16 Apr. 2012. &lt;http://www.eric.ed.gov/PDFS/ED499158.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; These trends have become the basis for sociological theories, including oppositional culture that explain these continuing racial gaps in education achievement.

==Contributions of John Ogbu==
John Ogbu’s primary goal in his research was to explain “academic performance of racial and ethnic minorities with reference to broader societal structures and historical processes &lt;ref name="massey"&gt;Massey, Douglas S. The Source of the River: The Social Origins of Freshmen at America's Selective Colleges and Universities. Princeton, NJ: Princeton UP, 2003. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;” John Ogbu used case studies, the most famous of which examined the affluent neighborhood of Shaker Heights, Ohio, to research variables that represented oppositional culture. These variables included several explanations of academic disengagement based on African Americans’ self-perception of their work load, their own and white people’s academic efforts, and their own explanations for their disengagement.&lt;ref name="ogbu" /&gt; From this case study and other research, Ogbu formulated his theory of oppositional culture.

===Voluntary vs involuntary minorities===
As part of Ogbu’s analysis, he defines the position of voluntary minorities versus the position of involuntary minorities.  Voluntary minorities in the United States include immigrant minorities such as Chinese and Korean immigrants as well as autonomous minorities such as Mormons and Jews.  Involuntary minorities comprise largely of [[African Americans]], Native Americans, Mexicans, and Puerto Ricans who were incorporated into American society against their will through colonization, slavery, and conquest.&lt;ref name="massey" /&gt; While voluntary minorities view cultural differences as obstacles to be overcome, involuntary minorities view participation in dominant cultural practices as a betrayal of their group loyalty and a threat to their identity.

Ogbu argues that in African American cultures, a collective identity is created from a young age in which cultural frames of reference indicate behaviors that belong culturally and those that do not. According to self-reports of African American students, “[[African American Vernacular English|talking proper]]”, playing sports dominated by white students, and having white friends all show that a person is acting white. Ogbu states that these cultural frames of reference create instances of peer pressure and discourage students from schoolwork.  While black students did not necessarily see getting good grades as acting white, they did disengage from academic work because they perceived certain attitudes and behaviors that were conducive to making good grades as acting white.  These behaviors include the use of [[Standard English]], enrollment in honors and AP classes and acting “smart” in class.&lt;ref name="ogbu" /&gt;  Additionally, students in the same sample felt that black individuals gave up some of their cultural background by succeeding in white institutions.

===Policy implications===
Based on his findings, Obgu has proposed certain policy changes to help decrease the gap in racial educational achievement. Ogbu argues that encouraging members of the black community to take proactive roles in increasing academic orientation, effort and performance will greatly affect their children’s academic performance.  Ogbu states that educational efforts are concurrent with cultural practices.  Additionally, he suggests supplementary education programs and increased visibility of successful black role models as helpful solutions.  Obgu also encouraged the development of effective parental educational strategies to combat his findings of little parental involvement in black communities, along with improvements in teacher’s expectations of Black students.&lt;ref name="ogbu" /&gt;

==Critical responses to Ogbu’s findings==
Many sociologists and sources have praised his studies as a valuable addition to the theories explaining the gap in educational achievement among different races.&lt;ref name="carter"&gt;Carter, Dorinda J. "Editor's Review of John U. Ogbu's Black American Students in an Affluent Suburb: A Study of Academic Disengagement." Harvard Educational Review. Harvard University, Winter 2004. Web. 18 Mar. 2012. &lt;http://www.hepg.org/her/abstract/38&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, his research has spurred similar ethno-cultural case studies around the world that have linked gaps in achievement to communities.  One example is a case study done in the UK in 2006 by two researchers, Tomlin and Olusola, that sought to discover factors and conditions that affect the achievement levels of high-achieving black students in two urban secondary schools.  The study found that [[British African-Caribbean community|African-Caribbean]] students reported obstacles similar to those faced by African Americans in their attempts to achieve at the levels of their white peers.,&lt;ref name="Macombe"/&gt; Studies that seek to explain overall achievement gaps between blacks and whites have also looked at Ogbu’s criteria from his case studies in education.

However, other sociologists have argued against the validity of his claims.  His findings are most often criticized for overgeneralizing the experience of the black community.&lt;ref name="carter" /&gt;  A study by Ainsworth-Darnell and Downey found that black students are significantly more likely to believe that education increases the chances of finding a job, and that smart African American students are held in higher esteem by their peers for high academic achievement. These findings all contradict the oppositional culture model proposed by Ogbu.&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth-Darnell, James W., and Douglas B. Downey. "Assessing the Oppositional Culture Explanation for Racial/Ethnic Differences in School Performance." American Sociological Review 63.4 (1998): 536-53. Jstor. Web. 16 Mar. 2012. https://www.jstor.org/stable/2657266?seq=10&lt;/ref&gt; Another study by Cook and Ludwig found that after controlling for socioeconomic status, on average black students were no less alienated from school than white students and were no less popular for being good students.&lt;ref name="massey" /&gt;  These studies show that inconsistencies regarding the existence of oppositional cultures in black communities persist.

==Alternative explanations==
While oppositional culture offers one explanation for the gap in racial educational achievement, there are alternative explanations for this phenomenon.

==Prudence Carter==
Prudence Carter, a sociologist at Stanford University, published findings that directly contradicted Ogbu’s research that African Americans viewed educational attainment as acting white. She showed in her research, published in her book “Keepin’ it Real: School Success Beyond Black and White”, that the majority of minority students shared 'white' [[norm (social)|normative values]] about the roles of work and success.  Carter argues that the possession of capital and upper [[socioeconomic status]] did not guarantee more interactions with one race over another and that upwardly mobile minorities are more inclined to associate with individuals from their same class over their same racial identification.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, Prudence L. Keepin' It Real: School Success beyond Black and White. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2005. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Carter states that a focus on racialized communities is not enough- a holistic acknowledgement of the relevance and depth of students’ general attitudes and beliefs and how these affect schooling will help improve education policies. Studies of these attitudes should rely less on racial lines and focus more on ethno-cultural identities of the individual.

This work is supported by a study by Charles ''et al.'' that surveyed the cultural backgrounds of black students in elite universities in the United States.  The study found that even though immigrants of African heritage from Africa and the Caribbean represent less than ten percent of the total black population in the National Longitudinal Survey of Freshmen (NISF), half of them went to l0 of the most selective NISF schools. More than one third of [[multiracial]] black and other race individuals, who are only 11 percent of the population, also attend the top 10 NISF schools. Multiracial individuals and African immigrants typically are advantaged in socioeconomic status and pre-college preparation.&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher, Charles A. "Black like Who?" Racism in Post-race America: New Theories, New Directions. Chapel Hill, NC: Social Forces, University of North Carolina, 2008. 247-63. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; This work shows that race may not be the primary determinant of racial educational achievement and that other factors including socioeconomic status play larger roles in determining educational outcome.

==Stereotype Threat Assumption==
[[Stereotype threat|Stereotype Threat Assumption]] is another explanation for the racial gap in educational achievement.  According to this theory, African Americans endure stereotypes of intellectual inferiority. Fearing that they would meet these expectations of underperformance, they make the decision to disengage from academics. Additionally, studies have shown that stereotypes themselves divert mental resources away from the area of concentration and can worsen classroom performance, comfort interacting with teachers, and other areas of scholastic life.&lt;ref&gt;Steele, Claude. Whistling Vivaldi: And Other Clues to How Stereotypes Affect Us. New York: W.W. Norton &amp;, 2010. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; These feelings of anxiety combined with the stigmatization acts as an inherent obstacle for African American educational achievement. Some African Americans choose to disengage from academics altogether to avoid meeting the expectations of failure and underachievement. This disengagement in academics demonstrates a perceived devaluation in African American culture.&lt;ref name="massey" /&gt;

==Capital deficiency==
The capital deficiency theory is heavily related to [[Racial inequality in the United States]], specifically the racial wealth gap. Wealthier families with higher [[economic capital]] can afford to provide additional resources for their children to combat any learning difficulties they may face naturally.  A related form of capital, [[human capital]], or the skills, abilities, and knowledge possessed by an individual are passed down in families with higher accumulation of human capital.  Parents with higher human capital are also better prepared to supervise their children's acquisition of it. [[Social capital]] and [[cultural capital]] also provide the means for increased support in educational outcomes. Social and cultural capital help to expose children into beneficial social institutions through bonds of kinship and friendship with the skills to navigate these social spheres fluidly.&lt;ref name="massey" /&gt;

The '''Paper Project''' is a fusion project that blends art, science, and technology into engaging 2D and 3D experiences.

==About the project==

The Paper Project is a multidimensional art and science project exploring the microscopic structure of paper using a [[Confocal laser scanning microscopy|scanning-laser confocal microscope]]. Created by artist and scientist Charles Kazilek and printer and paper maker Gene Valentine in 1999 the project has been exhibiting works in various formats including 2D and virtual 3D images. The 3D [[anaglyphic]] images make use of inexpensive red-blue [[Anaglyph 3D|3D glasses]] first introduced to movie goers in the 1950s. When wearing 3D glasses, it is as if the viewer has been reduced to the size of a period at the end of a sentence and is able to explore the invisible structure and beauty of paper.

In 2002, the project expanded to dance, collaborating with costume designers Jacqueline Benard and Galina Mihaleva and dance choreographer Jennifer Tsukayama.  The result of the collaboration was ''Paper Interiors: a dance exploration of real and virtual dimensions'' that debuted at the American College Dance Festival. In 2004, Jennifer Tsukayama became a member of the Paper Project and the group created a traveling 3D immersive room based on the earlier dance performance. The first installation of the room was at the Arizona Museum for Youth.

Since its creation, images from the Paper Project have been viewed around the world in museums, science centers, and on the Web. In addition to exhibits the Paper Project has developed educational content that can be used to engage students in art, history, biology, chemistry, and physics.

'''Parallel Education''' is a system in which boys and girls in Australia attend the same school, but are split into [[Gender segregation|single sex]] classes for core subjects such as [[English language|English]], [[Maths]], [[science]], [[LOTE]], and [[humanities]]. However, [[student]]s will come together for [[drama]], [[music]] and other social and cultural activities although a strict 30&amp;nbsp;cm personal space rule applies. Theoretically, this means that students will receive the best education while still being able to interact with the opposite sex. {{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

[[Haileybury College, Melbourne]] currently operates Parallel Education at their five campuses with many other leading schools set to follow.

'''Passive learning''' is a [[Teaching method|method of learning or instruction]] where students receive information from the instructor and internalize it, and "where the learner receives no feedback from the instructor".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/passive-learning.html BusinessDirectory.com, definition].  Retrieved 2016-04-02&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HRQ"&gt;[http://www.units.miamioh.edu/celt/events/docs/CFLING/active%20vs%20passive.pdf Norbert Michel, John James Cater III, Otmar Varela:  ''Active Versus Passive Teaching Styles: An Empirical Study of Student Learning Outcomes'',  Human Resource Development Quarterly, DOI: 10.1002/hrdq, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. / Business].  Retrieved 2016-04-02&lt;/ref&gt;  The term is often used together with ''[[direct instruction]]'' and ''[[lecture|lecturing]]'', with passive learning being the result or intended outcome of the instruction. This style of learning is [[Traditional education|teacher-centered]] and contrasts to [[active learning]], which is [[student-centered]], whereby students take an active or participatory role in the learning process, and to the [[Socratic method]] where students and instructors engage in cooperative argumentative dialogue.  Passive learning is a traditional method utilized in [[factory model school]]s and modern schools, as well as historic and contemporary religious services in churches ([[sermons]]), [[mosque]]s, and [[synagogue]]s.

Passive learning is not simply the outcome of an educational model.  Passive learners may quietly absorb information and knowledge without typically engaging with the information received or the learning experience. They may not interact with others, share insights, or contribute to a dialogue. An estimated 60 percent of people are passive learners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clomedia.com/2013/01/10/engage-passive-learners/ Engage Passive Learnings, Chief Learning Officer, January 10, 2013].  Retrieved 2016-04-02&lt;/ref&gt;

==Passive vs. active learning==
The effectiveness of traditional instruction and passive learning methods have been under debate for some time.&lt;ref name="HRQ"/&gt;  The modern origins of [[progressive education]], with active learning as a component, can be traced back to the 18th century works of [[John Locke]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], both of whom are known as forerunners of ideas that would be developed by 20th century theorists such as [[John Dewey]]. Locke wrote that "truth and knowledge… arise out of observation and experience rather than manipulation of accepted or given ideas".&lt;ref name="Hayes"&gt;{{cite book

===Advantages===
Advantages of passive learning include: exposure to new material, greater control by the instructor over the classroom, audience, or students; opportunity for a structured and engaging format; ensuring a complement to the subject matter outside of the [[learning environment]] and [[learning space]]; the ability to clarify course material; presentation of a large amount of information in a short time; instructional materials (lecture notes, handouts, audiovisual media, etc.) can be prepared in advance; important concepts and content can be identified and presented in an organized, structured, and meaningful manner; the potential to facilitate large-class communication.&lt;ref name=cirtl /&gt;  This format can also permit dissemination of materials not yet published or readily available.

A randomized, controlled trial comparing passive (60-minute lecture) and active (30-minute lecture along with interactions between student pairs) showed no differences between the two methods in students' knowledge or attitudes. However, the perception of engagement with the delivered content was lower for the passive learning group.&lt;ref name="Haidet"&gt;{{cite journal| pmid=14739758 | doi=10.1023/B:AHSE.0000012213.62043.45 | volume=9 | title=A controlled trial of active versus passive learning strategies in a large group setting | year=2004 | journal=Adv Health Sci Educ Theory Pract | pages=15–27 | last1 = Haidet | first1 = P | last2 = Morgan | first2 = RO | last3 = O'Malley | first3 = K | last4 = Moran | first4 = BJ | last5 = Richards | first5 = BF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disadvantages===
Disadvantages of passive learning include the required assumption that for learning to be successful, the students will receive the subject matter with "open minds, like empty vessels or sponges"; the instructor will fill the minds of the students with knowledge in order to obtain better examination results.&lt;ref name="McManus"&gt;[https://d32ogoqmya1dw8.cloudfront.net/files/nagt/jge/abstracts/McManus_v49n5p423.pdf Dean A. McManus, ''The Two Paradigms of Education and the Peer Review of Teaching'',  Journal of Geoscience Education, V.49, n.5, November 2001, P423-434].  Retrieved 2016-04-02&lt;/ref&gt; Passive learning allows limited opportunity to assess how well students are learning content and for questions, clarification, or discussion.  Students may be reticent about letting instructors know they do not understand key information and they may be reluctant to ask questions in class.  With no opportunity for application, it does not consistently engage students' use of higher-level cognitive skills.  A standard model is lecture-format with one-way communication which does not engage the listener.  It also requires the instructor to have effective speaking and presentation skills. Students are expected to wait for information to be provided and then to follow directions on what to do with that information. Emphasis is placed on repeating information without reflecting or demonstrating an understanding.  This can result in ''surface processing'' instead of [[Deeper Learning|deeper learning]], less ability to use what is learned, and the study being deemed irrelevant by the students.&lt;ref name=cirtl&gt;{{cite web|title=Lecturing: Advantages and Disadvantages of the Traditional Lecture Method|url=http://www.cirtl.net/node/2570|publisher=CIRTL Network|accessdate=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The disadvantages of passive learning can be compared to the advantages of active learning.  It has been suggested that while active ''engagement'' with material, students, instructors, etc. might be critical to learning, active ''participation'' may not be.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurodl.org/?p=archives&amp;year=2014&amp;halfyear=2&amp;article=649 Donna Smith and Katy Smith, ''The Case for 'Passive’ Learning – The 'Silent’ Community of Online Learners'', European Journal of Open,  Distance, and E-Learning].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4538">A school '''period''' is a block of time allocated for lessons, classes in schools.&lt;ref name="Definition htof Class Period"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/class+period | title=Definition of Class Period by The Free Dictionary | publisher=Farlex | accessdate=July 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They typically last between 40 and 60 minutes, with around 3-8 periods per school day. However, especially in higher education, there can be many more. Educators determine the number and length of these periods, and may even regulate how each period will be used. One common example of this practice is to designate at least one compulsory period a day for physical education.&lt;ref name="Proposed Compulsory Sports Period"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Gill-wants-a-compulsory-sports-period-in-schools/articleshow/5854061.cms#ixzz0yHgn7YRb | title=The Times of India: Gill wants a compulsory sports period in schools | accessdate=July 22, 2011 | work=The Times Of India | date=April 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Free period==
One special example of a [[high school]] period is the free period. These typically involve having 15 minutes of mostly unsupervised activities. A free period (also called "free" "spare" or "unstructured") is generally found in most high schools and [[college]]s. During a free period, a student can either:
* Walk around the [[campus]] freely until the next period. Some high schools permit students to leave the campus and go home, visit shops or areas nearby that are outside the school grounds.
* Stay in a designated [[common room|study room]] or [[classroom]] and either talk or work on [[homework]]
* Use it as an opportunity to meet up with [[teacher]]s and ask about missed work or another question.
* Study for any upcoming tests/exams.
* In some schools, [[lunch]] is also consumed during a student's free period.

Some schools have an extended lunch period and that could be used as a free period as well. Lunch periods in high school could be up to 60 minutes long.

A free period in a [[college]] is a time period that a student is not enrolled in a class. During the free period, students are completely free of adult supervision and could do whatever they want that complies to the campus rules and the law.

==Study period==
Another special example of a middle school and high school period is the study period. In school or college, a study period is a period in a student's timetable where a student may undertake self-directed learning activities, rather than having lessons being taught by a teacher.

While study periods are normally intended for study activities, such as set exercises, problem solving, or homework, students often consider these periods of the school day as free periods and may use the time to socialize rather than study. For this reason, study periods may often be supervised by a teacher being present in the study room. In some instances, the teacher may even tutor the students, and the study period may become a tutorial, although this is not normally the case.
Study periods often occur because of scheduling conflicts in the school timetable, when there is a mismatch between available students, teachers, subjects and classrooms.

Study periods are generally monitored by teachers or teacher's aides, who often encourage students to use this time to complete homework, catch up on missing assignments, or study for tests or quizzes. Sometimes, students also use periods to converse, make phone calls, text message, play video games, or otherwise socialize or pursue non-academic topics, though this is sometimes discouraged or forbidden. Periods in which such things are allowed are occasionally differentiated from study periods by the name "free period". Some students even eat lunch during a study period due to long lines and short lunch periods at their schools.

Study periods are often used by students to visit with teachers, who have a "prep period", in order to discuss work or assignments. A study period can be a period to utilize school resources or otherwise request teacher assistance in any subject not understood by the student.

Many academics feel that study period is an inefficient allocation of time which is often underutilized, but others say it is a positive addition to a regular schedule because it creates a good environment for completing homework or large projects.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4470">The '''R score''' ('''''cote de rendement au collégial''''', '''''CRC''''' or '''''cote R''''' in [[French language|French]]) is a [[statistics|statistical]] method which classifies [[College education in Quebec|college]] students' academic performances in [[Quebec]]. It is used by Quebec [[university|universities]] for selection purposes.

The R score is in fact a [[standard score|''z''-score]] (Zcol) multiplied by a group dispersion indicator (IDGZ) to which an indicator of group strength (ISGZ) has been added.

:R score = ( (Zcol x IDGZ) + ISGZ + C ) x D , where C = D = 5

The Zcol is the number of standard deviations the student is above the class average and gives an indication of the grade of the student with respect to the grades of other students in the class. The ISGZ is the average high school z-score (Zsec) the group's students obtained on the MEES uniform examination subjects in Secondary 4 and 5. The IDGZ is the standard deviation of the students' Zsec scores. The inclusion of the ISGZ and IDGZ in the determination of the R score allows for a more equitable comparison between students, regardless of their CEGEP's academic rank, although the effectiveness remains in dispute.

The use of the constant C = 5 greatly reduces the possibility of a negative value in the score and the multiplying the sum of all the preceding values by the constant D = 5 ensures the largeness of the score. The R score is defined such that the average is 25. Most R scores fall between 15 and 35, although any real number is a possible R score since the z-scores tend to positive or negative infinity as the standard deviation decreases. To guarantee that a grade of 100 will produce an R score of at least 35, an adjusted Z score formula guaranteed to produce a result above 35 is used. Grades below 50 are not considered when calculating the average and standard deviation of a grade distribution.

An R score is calculated for every course except for Physical Education taken before Fall 2007 or for remedial courses. The final R score is the weighted average of the R score in all courses. In addition, failed courses are given a reduced weight in the overall R score; they are weighted at 25% of the credits in the first semester and subsequently at 50%. 

==History==
Failed courses have been given a reduced weight since October 2004. Before the Fall 2007 semester, Physical Education courses were not given an R score. Before July 2017, the R score did not include the IDGZ and used calculated the ISG as 

:ISG = ( Average grade results of Secondary 4 and 5 of all the group's students - 75 ) / 14.

Also until July 2017, an additional score of 0.5 was added to the overall R score to a student graduating with an [[International Baccalaureate]] degree or a ''DEC (Diplôme d'études collégiales) en Sciences, Lettres et Arts''. The adjustment of Z score using the IDGZ makes this unnecessary. 

==Criticism==
Firsthand experience suggests that the R score is not as ideal a tool as it was meant to be. A recurring complaint from students is that the ISG does not seem to sufficiently offset the advantage enjoyed by students in weak groups. Such students have the opportunity to obtain grades much higher than the low average of their class, thus earning an elevated Z score, whereas students in strong groups cannot earn such high Z scores. One possible reason for this is that the ISG for a certain course is based on the average of the grades in all high school courses, which may not correlate to the group's strength in that course as much as the average of the grades of similar courses in high school. 

Such perceived weaknesses of the R score are particularly worrying, because it is the main and sometimes only criterion considered by Quebec universities during the admissions process. Since the R score is perceived as an absolute measure of a student's academic performance regardless of their College academic rank, differences smaller than 0.5 are often used to discriminate between candidates applying to programs with fixed quotas, such as medicine, pharmacy, dentistry or law.

'''Research-informed Teaching''' refers to the practice of linking research with teaching in [[Higher education|Higher Education]]. Most universities in the world are organised into teaching and research divisions. Professors and lecturers will normally be contracted to do both and, in theory at least, course syllabi are structured around the teacher's research interests. Since the 1980s, there has been a growing movement to further integrate the two activities. This has led to a new interest in undergraduate research, where students enrolled on bachelor's degrees are given the opportunity to participate in research projects or undertake their own research.

This concept is also coined as '''Teaching-as-Research''' or '''Research-based Practices in Teaching''' in higher education. There are growing number of activities supported and sponsored by inter-university organizations such as the National Center for the Integration of Research, Teaching and Learning (CIRTL) Network.[https://www.cirtl.net/] 

==Worldwide==
This practice was pioneered in America, where there is now a nationwide Council for Undergraduate Research, and in Australia. Recently, the UK Government funded several 'centres of excellence' which focus in different ways on undergraduate research. One of the most important is the  Reinvention Centre for Undergraduate Research, which was set up in the Sociology department at [[University of Warwick|Warwick University]] in  partnership with the School of the [[Built environment|Built Environment]] at  [[Oxford Brookes University]] under the directorship of Mike Neary. The Centre's journal, Reinvention, launched in September 2007. In 2006, the UK Government also invested c.£25m into universities across the country to strengthen research-informed teaching. Key publications by Alan Jenkins, Roger Zetter, Mick Healey and Angela Brew have further developed the research base for research-informed teaching. In April 2007 the University of [[Central Lancashire]] appointed the first ever Chair in Research-informed Teaching, Stuart Hampton-Reeves, and in September 2007 launched a Centre for Research-informed Teaching.

==Efficacy==
While university instruction is optimal when grounded in empirical findings, some concerns have arisen regarding the efficacy of university instruction at research focused institutions. A growing number of these higher education research institutions focus on the researching prowess of the potential professor (and, in many cases, the grant-writing ability of prospective employee) while often paying substantially less attention to one's ability to disseminate the information.  Of course, those talented instructors who are both strong in research and instruction have the potential to really impact their students.

The '''Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (SOTL or SoTL)''' is often defined as systematic inquiry into student learning which advances the practice of teaching by making inquiry findings public&lt;ref&gt;Hutchings, P., &amp; Shulman, L. S. (1999). The Scholarship of Teaching: New Elaborations, New Developments. ''Change: The Magazine of Higher Learning, 31''(5), 10-15. doi:10.1080/00091389909604218&lt;/ref&gt;.

SOTL necessarily builds on many past traditions in higher education, including classroom and program assessment, action research&lt;ref&gt;Sappington, N., Baker, P. J., Gardner, D., &amp; Pacha, J. (2010). A signature pedagogy for leadership education: Preparing principals through participatory action research. ''Planning and Changing, 41''(3/4), 249-273. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zambo, D. (2010). Action research as signature pedagogy in an education doctorate program: The reality and hope. ''Innovative Higher Education, 36''(4), 261-271. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacobsen, D. M., Eaton, S. E., Brown, B., Simmons, M., &amp; McDermott, M. (2018). Action research for graduate program improvements: A response to curriculum mapping and review. ''Canadian Journal of Higher Education, 48''(1), 82-98. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://journals.sfu.ca/cjhe/index.php/cjhe/article/view/188048&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;, the reflective practice movement, peer review of teaching, traditional educational research, and faculty development efforts to enhance teaching and learning. 

As such, SOTL encompasses aspects of professional development or faculty development, such as how teachers can not only improve their expertise in their fields, but also develop their pedagogical expertise, i.e., how to better teach novice students in the field or enable their learning. It also encompasses the study and implementation of more modern teaching methods, such as [[active learning]], [[cooperative learning]], [[Problem-based learning|problem based learning]], and others. SOTL scholars come from various backgrounds, such as those in educational psychology and other education related fields, as well as  specialists in various disciplines who are interested in improving teaching and learning in their respective fields. Some scholars are educational researchers or consultants affiliated with [[teaching and learning center]]s at universities.

Inquiry methods in SOTL include reflection and analysis, interviews and focus groups, questionnaires and surveys, content analysis of text, secondary analysis of existing data, [[quasi-experiment]]s (comparison of two sections of the same course), observational research, and case studies, among others. As with all scholarly study, evidence depends not only upon the methods chosen but the relevant disciplinary standards. Dissemination for impact among scholarly teachers may be local within the academic department, college or university, or may be in published, peer-reviewed form. A few journals exclusively publish SOTL outputs, and numerous disciplinary publications disseminate such inquiry outputs (e.g., ''J. Chem. Educ.'', ''J. Natural Resour. Life Sci. Educ.'', ''Research in the Teaching of English'', ''College English'', ''J. Economic Education''), as well as a number of core SoTL journals and newsletters.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ilstu.edu/~sknaylor/sotl.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Signature pedagogies ==

Signature pedagogies are ways of learning in specific disciplines&lt;ref&gt;Shulman, L. (2005).

''Daedalus, 134''(3), 52-59. &lt;/ref&gt;. Examples of signature pedagogies include medical residents making rounds in hospitals or pre-service teachers doing a classroom-based practicum as part of their teacher training. The notion of signature pedagogies has expanded in recent years, as scholars have examined their use in e-learning&lt;ref&gt;Eaton, S. E., Brown, B., Schroeder, M., Lock, J., &amp; Jacobsen, M. (2017). ''Signature pedagogies for e-learning in higher education and beyond''. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://hdl.handle.net/1880/51848&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, B., Eaton, S.

Retrieved from https://prism.ucalgary.ca/handle/1880/52096&lt;/ref&gt;, for example. Some scholars contend that SoTL itself is a signature pedagogy of higher education&lt;ref&gt;Felten, P., &amp; Chick, N. (2018). Is SoTL a signature pedagogy of educational development? ''To Improve the Academy, 37''(1), 4-16. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://doi.org/10.1002/tia2.20077&lt;/nowiki&gt; doi:10.1002/tia2.20077&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Professional Societies ==

The [[International Society for the Scholarship of Teaching &amp; Learning]] (ISSOTL)] was founded in 2004 by a committee of 67 scholars from several countries and serves faculty members, staff, and students who care about teaching and learning as serious intellectual work. ISSOTL has held annual conferences since 2004, attended by scholars from about a dozen nations.  The conferences sites include Bloomington, Indiana USA (2004); Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada (2005); Washington, DC, USA (2006); Sydney, Australia (2007); Edmonton, Alberta, Canada (2008); Bloomington, Indiana, USA (2009); Liverpool, UK (2010); Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA (2011); Hamilton, Ontario, Canada (2012); Raleigh, North Carolina, USA (2013); Quebec City, Quebec, Canada (2014).

==Safety threats==
{{main|School violence}}

=== Shootings and bombings ===
In the US, as of January 2018, since 1990, at least 240 [[school shooting]]s have occurred. It's over a 450% increase of the previous 30 years, in which there were only 53 [[List of school shootings in the United States|shootings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duplechain|first=Rosalind|last2=Morris|first2=Robert|date=Winter 2014|title=School Violence: Reported School Shootings and Making Schools Safer|url=|journal=Education|volume= 135|pages=145-150|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt; School bombings are less frequent at 22 in 2016, but according to the [[U.S. Bomb Data Center|US Bomb Data Center]], education related buildings are over twice as threatened than any other target.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.atf.gov/explosives/docs/report/2016-explosives-incident-report/download|title=United States Bomb Data Center Explosive Incident Report|date=2016|work=ATF.gov|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 74% of education related threats were middle schools, junior high, and high schools. Due to safety threats, during the 2013-2014 school year, reports say 93% of public schools lock or monitor doors and gates as a means of controlling access to the school;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=334|title=The NCES Fast Facts Tool provides quick answers to many education questions (National Center for Education Statistics)|website=nces.ed.gov|language=EN|access-date=2018-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; this is an 18% increase since the turn of the century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kennedy|first=Mike|date=June 2016|title=Stepping Up Security|url=|journal=American School &amp; University|volume= 88|pages=14-18|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metal detectors are installed at many entrances of public schools to deter students from bringing weaponry into schools.&lt;ref&gt;"Government Gives Go-Ahead to Metal Detectors in Schools."

=== Vandalism ===
[[Vandalism]] is often a problem for schools as they are an easy target. What constitutes vandalism varies among reports, which makes it difficult to get an accurate view of the extent of vandalism. However, vandalism generally refers to damage to property (graffiti, etc.), and break-ins. The Center for Problem Oriented Policing categorizes break-ins as being of three types: nuisance break-ins, where a break-in is done just for the sake of it; professional break-ins, with an intent of theft; and malicious break-ins, where damage is caused out of spite.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Community Policing: Partnerships for Problem Solving|last=Miller|first=Linda S.|last2=Hess|first2=Karen M.|last3=Orthmann|first3=Christine M.H.|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2010|isbn=1435488687|edition= 6th|location=|pages=362}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solutions for preventing vandalism include providing after-school and evening programs to engage youth that are loitering, improving lighting, adding security patrols, and education for students on anti-vandalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Violence in America's Schools: Understanding, Prevention, and Responses|last=Thomas|first=Robert Murray|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2006|isbn=0275993299|location=|pages=159–160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Policies on vandalism in New Zealand ====
''see [[Education in New Zealand]]''

The New Zealand government provides funding to public schools to repair vandalism. This funding comes from different sources depending on the type of damage that occurs. Two important guidelines regarding vandalism repair are that it must "be carried out immediately, and comply with Ministry standards."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.education.govt.nz/school/property/state-schools/funding/vandalism-funding/|title=Vandalism funding to repair school property|last=|first=|date=July 14, 2017|website=Education in New Zealand|language=en-NZ|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bullying ===

{{main|School bullying}}

The National Center for Education Statistics reports that in the U.S., 20.8% of students ages 12–18 experienced bullying at school in 2014-15.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lessne|first=Deborah|last2=Yanez|first2=Christina|date=December 2016|title=Student Reports of Bullying|url=|journal=National Center for Education Statistics|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prevention for bullying by parents, teachers, and other adults includes talking to students about bullying, modeling good examples of treating others with kindness, and helping students get involved in something they're passionate about. Helping students understand the importance of reporting bullying and teaching them ways to stop others from bullying can also be effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.stopbullying.gov/prevention/index.html|title=How to Prevent Bullying|last=|first=|date=September 8, 2017|work=StopBullying.gov|access-date=2018-02-03|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the ages of 11-15, in most countries around the world, boys are bullied more than girls.  As reported by Young People's Health in Context, in Israel, almost twice as many boys ages 13–15 are bullied than girls; Belgium has a difference nearly as high. On average, bullying tends to peak at age 13. Lithuania experiences the highest level of bullying, with an average of 63.6% for girls between the ages of 11-15, and an average of 65% for boys between the ages of 11-15. Sweden experiences the lowest level of bullying, with an average of 14.7% for girls between 11-15, and an average of 15.3% for boys between 11-15.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Craig|first=Wendy M.|last2=Harel|first2=Yossi|date=|title=Bullying, physical fighting and victimization|url=https://www.biu.ac.il/SOC/hbsc/books/2.pdf|journal=Young People's Health in Context|volume=|pages=138|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Security Measures==
The [[National School Boards Association]] states that ensuring safety and security in schools is the primary responsibility of every school district.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nsba.org/services/school-board-leadership-services/school-safety-and-security|title=School Safety, Security, and Emergency Preparedness {{!}} National School Boards Association|website=www.nsba.org|access-date=2018-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===School Resource Officers===
As we see a rise in gang and drug activity among other safety threats in our schools, there has been an increase in police presence on school campuses. In 2014 the National Center for Education Statistics reported that 43% of schools in the U.S. had [[School resource officer|School Resource Officers]] on their campuses anywhere from once a week to full-time hours of operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2015/2015051.pdf|title=Public School Safety and Discipline 2013-14|last=Gray|first=Lucinda|last2=Lewis|first2=Laurie|date=May 2015|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

School Resource Officers, also known as S.R.O.s, are often responsible for teaching a gang-resistance program to students. Commonly referred to as [[Gang Resistance Education and Training|G.R.E.A.T.]], this program has been shown to be 39% effective at deterring at-risk youth from becoming involved in gangs or gang-related activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Higgins|first=Brian|date=September 2015|title=Helping At-Risk Youth Say "No" to Gangs|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/248777.pdf|journal=National Institute of Justice|volume=|issue=275|pages=3|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of these S.R.O.s are accompanied by dogs that are fully trained in drug and bomb sniffing. Although this could be potentially helpful, especially in the drug culture among students, it is a highly controversial issue as some believe it may go against Fourth (and possibly Fifth) Amendment Rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centerforpubliceducation.org/Main-Menu/Public-education/The-law-and-its-influence-on-public-school-districts-An-overview/Search-and-seizure-due-process-and-public-schools.html|title=Search and seizure, due process, and public schools|last=Darden|first=Edwin C.|date=April 5, 2006|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surveillance===
Digital [[surveillance]] technology monitoring students, staff and visitors is currently being employed in schools around the world. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, by 2014 an average of 80% of secondary schools in the United States had installed security cameras. This was over 300% increase compared to the 19% of public educational facilities using video surveillance in 2000.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; [[Closed-circuit television]] (CCTV), the most common type of video monitoring system, is also reported to be prevalent in the United Kingdom and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Nemorin, Selena (2017) Post-panoptic pedagogies: the changing nature of school surveillance in the digital age. Surveillance and Society, 15 (2). pp. 239-253. ISSN 1477-7487&lt;/ref&gt; A possible 85-90% of secondary schools used CCTV in Britain, according to statistics claimed by [[Big Brother Watch]]. Cameras are also installed on buses to prevent violence, theft, illegal activity by students or drivers and as evidence against motorists who violate traffic laws regarding school buses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nea.org/home/68189.htm|title=School Bus Safety is a Shared Responsibility|work=NEA|access-date=2018-02-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the new wave of technology, [[Computer security|cyber-security]] has also become a concern as schools try to balance advancement in students' technological skills with the possibilities for misuse of borrowed devices and breeches in school servers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.edweek.org/ew/articles/2006/01/18/19hacking.h25.html?qs=cyber+security+concerns+mount|title=Education news|last=Borja|first=Rhea R.|date=18 January 2006|work=Educaion Week|access-date=3 February 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Identification cards and badges ===
Student and faculty ID cards and/or badges are a possible way of improving school security. They allow school authorities to know immediately that the people carrying or wearing ID belong there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2013/11/27/student-technology-tracking/3757459/|title=Cards let schools, parents keep eye on their students|last=Brown|first=Jessica|date=November 27, 2013|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2018-02-01|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Student ID cards can also help keep track of where students are.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=School Board Discusses Student ID Cards|last=Ingram|first=Cinde|date=August 9, 2017|work=High Point Enterprise (NC)|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tracking students through tracking chips has been controversial, however, due to concerns for privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.edweek.org/dd/articles/2010/02/03/02id.h03.html|title=Education Week: Student ID Cards Sport New Digital Features|last=Ash|first=Katie|date=January 29, 2010|website=www.edweek.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Identification badges for visitors to schools can alleviate confusion about who someone unfamiliar is, and school authorities will easily be able to determine where the visitor is authorized to go.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kennedy|first=Mike|date=October 2017|title=Enhancing School Security|url=|journal=American School and University|volume= 90| issue = 2|pages= 14–17|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt; These visitor badges can also be a way to conduct background checks before the visitor enters a school campus.

====ID Cards in Poland====
{{main|Polish identity card}}

Students in schools abroad (outside of Poland) who are learning Polish language or academic subjects taught in Polish are eligible for Polish student ID cards. These cards provide benefits including transportation, museum, and national park discounts while visiting Poland. Students under age 18 can get one of these IDs, as well as teachers of Polish. They are valid for one school year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://newyork.mfa.gov.pl/en/news/student_id_cards_?printMode=true|title=Student ID cards|last=|first=|date=May 17, 2017|website=newyork.mfa.gov.pl|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== School Security Fencing ===
Within the United Kingdom and around the globe one of the first line of school security measures is the application of a fencing system to control ingress and egress from the school grounds. Recently guidance by NaCTSO is that 'Screen from View' fencing should be adopted on school perimeters to combat the terrorist threat to schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/crowded-places-guidance|title=Crowded places guidance|website=GOV.UK|language=en|access-date=2018-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the UK, one of the largest manufacturers and suppliers of School Security Fencing&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cld-fencing.com/sectors/school-fencing/|title=School Fencing {{!}} Playground Fencing {{!}} CLD Fencing Systems|website=CLD Fencing|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; is CLD Fencing Systems. For over 20 years their range of school fencing has provided protection for hundreds of thousands of pupils across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.

OFSTED now includes the perimeter school fencing and physical access control as an area of review in the safeguarding of pupils on school grounds.

A '''strength and conditioning coach''' is a [[physical fitness|fitness]] and physical performance professional who uses [[exercise prescription]] specifically, but not limited, to improve the performance of competitive athletes.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.eis2win.co.uk/expertise/strength-conditioning/|title=Strength &amp; Conditioning - English Institute of Sport|work=English Institute of Sport|access-date=16 May 2017|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is achieved through the combination of [[strength training]] and [[aerobic conditioning]], alongside a variety of further methods. Strength and conditioning coaches also help athletes with injury prevention and proper mechanics within their sports performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Strength and conditioning coach|url=http://www.humankinetics.com/excerpts/excerpts/strength-and-conditioning-coach|publisher=Human Kinetics|access-date=10 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Employment characteristics ==
[[File:Australian Opals in the AIS Strength and Conditioning Gym during day three of the Opals camp.jpg|thumb|A strength and conditioning gym]]
Strength and conditioning coaches may work with sports teams, as well as individuals. Strength and conditioning coaches are often employed by [[higher education]] institutions and professional athletic teams.

Strength and conditioning coaches have the option to specialize in a particular sports team, type of performance, training type, training philosophy, or work in the collegiate level, where they are assigned a sport. The general description and duty of a strength and conditioning coach is to develop an exercise prescription plan that modulates aerobic, resistance, and/or flexibility training to suit the metabolic and physical demands of the sport in question.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  With [[aerobic exercise]] prescription, strength and conditioning coaches determine the type, duration, and frequency of each exercise.  For [[resistance exercise]] prescription, the type of exercise, total session volume, rest period, frequency, and intensity are determined.&lt;ref&gt;Kraemer, WJ. Exercise Physiology: Integrating Theory and Application.  Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins. Chapter 12.  Ahead of print, March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; They may also be involved in prescription of [[stretching]] routines or other approaches.  [[Nutrition]] and medical consultation are not within their scope of practice and training qualifications.

== Qualification standards ==

=== United States ===
In the US, The National Strength and Conditioning Association offers a Certified Strength and Conditioning Coach qualification that is required for positions in the field.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}} In addition to the C.S.C.S. certification, it is encouraged to attain a bachelor's degree in majors that are related to exercise science due to the competitiveness of the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nsca.com/education/articles/career-series/becoming-a-strength-and-conditioning-coach/|title=Becoming a Strength and Conditioning Coach|access-date=27 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Collegiate Strength &amp; Conditioning Coaches association also offers certification exclusive to the collegiate and professional-level strength and conditioning coach. This certification is known as Strength &amp; Conditioning Coach Certified (SCCC) and requires a bachelor's degree and a 640-hour internship in addition to passing the certification exam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cscca.org/about|title=About Us|author=|date=|website=CSCCA.org|access-date=16 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
Strength and conditioning in the UK is generally overseen by the UK Strength and Conditioning Association (UKSCA) and the Register of Exercise Professionals (REPS). Both organisations provide regulations and standards for employers and professionals. A UKSCA membership and Bachelor's degree in sport and exercise science are generally accepted by many professional sports clubs as prerequisites for strength and conditioning positions. As well as the UKSCA and REPS, 1st4sport Qualifications offer standardised training in accordance with other official National Governing Body qualifications.

== Effectiveness ==
The implementation of effective strength and conditioning programmes has led to an increase in speed and strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Changes in Body Size and Physical Characteristics of South A... : The Journal of Strength &amp; Conditioning Research|url=http://journals.lww.com/nsca-jscr/Abstract/2015/04000/Changes_in_Body_Size_and_Physical_Characteristics.17.aspx|journal=LWW|language=en-US|doi=10.1519/JSC.0000000000000724}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Izquierdo|first=Mikel|last2=Häkkinen|first2=Keijo|last3=Gonzalez-Badillo|first3=Juan J.|last4=Ibáñez|first4=Javier|last5=Gorostiaga|first5=Esteban M.|date=1 July 2002|title=Effects of long-term training specificity on maximal strength and power of the upper and lower extremities in athletes from different sports|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00421-002-0628-y|journal=European Journal of Applied Physiology|language=en|volume=87|issue=3|pages=264–271|doi=10.1007/s00421-002-0628-y|issn=1439-6319}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Karsten|first=Bettina|last2=Stevens|first2=Liesbeth|last3=Colpus|first3=Mark|last4=Larumbe-Zabala|first4=Eneko|last5=Naclerio|first5=Fernando|date=2016-01-01|title=The Effects of a Sport-Specific Maximal Strength and Conditioning Training on Critical Velocity, Anaerobic Running Distance, and 5-km Race Performance|journal=International Journal of Sports Physiology and Performance|volume=11|issue=1|pages=80–85|doi=10.1123/ijspp.2014-0559|issn=1555-0273|pmid=25946163}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has demonstrated that not only does training improve performance but incorrect training (distance running, a [[slow-twitch muscle]] fiber activity, in football athletes with fast-twitch characteristics) can cause decrements to performance. Using techniques such as [[plyometrics]] in some high-power athletes and sports-specific movements in others, strength coaches may improve physical function and athletic performance.&lt;ref&gt;Kraemer, WJ. ''Exercise Physiology: Integrating Theory and Application''. Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins. Ahead of print, March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Criticism has followed the increased use of strength and conditioning coaches in a variety of sports due to the shift in importance to the size and speed of the players. In [[rugby union]], a game with heavy physical contact and minimal{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=June 2017}} protection, players are being described as being "too big", creating collisions that are increasing the risk of short and long term injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-34290980|title=How big will rugby players get?|last=Rhodes|first=David|date=19 September 2015|work=BBC News|access-date=16 May 2017|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, it has been proposed that the increased weight and speed of players and subsequent rise of collision [[force]] leads to more frequent and severe [[Concussion|concussion injuries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/premiership/11407436/Rugby-concussions-soar-by-59-per-cent-says-report.html|title=Rugby concussions soar by 59 per cent, says report|first=Daniel|last=Schofield|date=11 February 2015|work=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=16 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/27655550|title=Rugby's concussion issue under the spotlight|first=Tom|last=English|date=1 June 2014|work=BBC Sport|access-date=16 May 2017|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there is as yet no research to suggest an increased use of strength and conditioning leading to an increased risk of injury.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

(2003) [http://www.soundout.org/article.104.html "Broadening the bounds of involvement: Transforming schools with student voice."] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20141020174332/http://www.soundout.org/article.104.html |date=2014-10-20 }} SoundOut.org.&lt;/ref&gt;  Tech educator [[Dennis Harper]] writes, "Student voice is giving students the ability to influence learning to include policies, programs, contexts and principles."&lt;ref&gt;Harper, D. (2000). Students as Change Agents: The Generation Y Model. Olympia, WA: Generation Y.&lt;/ref&gt;

Student voice is the individual and collective perspective and actions of students within the context of learning and education.&lt;ref&gt;SoundOut. [http://www.soundout.org/tips.html Student Voice Tip Sheet]. Accessed 12/18/06.&lt;/ref&gt; It is identified in schools as both a metaphorical practice&lt;ref&gt;Britzman, D. (1989). "Who has the floor? Curriculum teaching and the English student teacher's struggle for voice", ''Curriculum Inquiry. 19''(2), 143-162.&lt;/ref&gt; and as a pragmatic concern.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, A. (2005).  "Student voice: Bridges to learning." Seattle: University of Washington.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practice==
According to Fletcher (2017), student voice is a phenomenon that has always been present in schools; what makes it noticeable is the willingness of educators and others to listen to student voice.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, A. (2017) ''Student Voice Revolution: The Meaningful Student Involvement Handbook.'' Olympia, WA: CommonAction Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

Student voice work is premised on the following convictions:
*Young people have unique perspectives on learning, teaching, and schooling;
*Their insights warrant not only the attention but also the responses of adults; and
*They should be afforded opportunities to actively shape their education.&lt;ref&gt;Cook-Sather, A. (2006). Sound, Presence, and Power: Exploring ‘Student Voice’ in Educational Research and Reform. Curriculum Inquiry 36, 4 (Winter), 359-390&lt;/ref&gt;

Several typologies differentiate the practices that identify as student voice.&lt;ref&gt;Fielding, M. (2004). “New wave” student voice and the renewal of civic society. ''London Review of Education'' 2, 3 (November), 197-217&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lodge, C. (2005). From hearing voices to engaging in dialogue: Problematising student participation in school improvement. ''Journal of Educational Change'', 6, 2 (June), 125-146.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thiessen, D. (1997). Knowing about, acting on behalf of, and working with primary pupils’ perspectives: Three levels of engagement with research. In A. Pollard, D. Thiessen &amp; A. Filer (Eds.), ''Children and their curriculum'' (pp. 184–196). London, Falmer Press.&lt;/ref&gt; One identifies multiple roles for students throughout the [[education system]], including education planning, research, teaching, evaluating, decision-making and [[Student activism|advocacy]].&lt;ref&gt;(n.d.)[http://www.soundout.org/examples.html Examples of Meaningful Student Involvement.] SoundOut website.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, A. (2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Administrative approaches===
The presence and engagement of student voice has been seen as essential to the [[educational process]] since at least the time of [[John Dewey]], if not long before. In 1916 Dewey wrote extensively about the necessity of engaging student experience and perspectives in the curriculum of schools, summarizing his support by saying,:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The essence of the demand for freedom is the need of conditions which will enable an individual to make his own special contribution to a group interest, and to partake of its activities in such ways that social guidance shall be a matter of his own mental attitude, and not a mere authoritative dictation of his acts.&lt;ref&gt;Democracy and Education. John Dewey, 1916&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Today student voice is seeing a resurgence of importance as a growing body of literature&lt;ref&gt;[http://soundout.org/bibliography.html SoundOut Student Voice Library]&lt;/ref&gt; increasingly identifies student voice as necessary throughout the educational process.&lt;ref&gt;Alison Cook-Sather, ''Authorizing Student Perspectives: Towards Trust, Dialogue, and Respect in Education'' (2002) http://www.aera.net/publications/?id=434&lt;/ref&gt; Areas where advocates encourage actively acknowledging student voice include [[curriculum|curriculum design]] and [[Teaching methods#Teaching|instructional methods]], [[Educational leadership]] and general [[school reform]] activities, including [[research]] and [[evaluation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soundout.org/links.html Student Voice Links] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060930030236/http://www.soundout.org/links.html |date=2006-09-30 }} from the SoundOut website&lt;/ref&gt;

===Curricular approaches===
Specific types of activities that can specifically engage student voice include [[learning by teaching]], education decision-making, school planning, [[participatory action research]], learning and teaching evaluations, educational advocacy, and student advisories for [[Principal (school)|principals]] and [[Superintendent (education)|superintendents]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soundout.org/MSIGuide.pdf Meaningful Student Involvement Guide to Students as Partners in School Change] Adam Fletcher, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Service learning====
Engaging student voice is a primary objective of [[service learning]], which commonly seeks to entwine classroom learning objectives with [[community service]] opportunities. Student voice is also present in [[student government]] programs, [[experiential education]] activities, and other forms of [[Student-centred learning|student-centered learning]].

===Student as education decision-makers===
Engaging students as educational decision-makers is the practice of actively [[teaching]] [[youth|young people]] [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]] for their [[education]] by [[Systematics - study of multi-term systems|systematically]] [[engagement|engaging]] them in making [[choices]] about [[learning]], [[schooling]], and the [[education system]] in areas ranging from what affects them personally to what affects an entire [[student body]] to what affects the entire [[school system]].

Choosing [[curricula]], calendar year planning, school [[building design]], teacher hiring, and many more issues are often seen as the duties of a school [[principal (school)|principal]] or [[teacher]]s. Today those roles are increasingly seen as avenues for student voice. Students are joining [[board of education|boards of education]] at all levels, including local, district, and state boards. Some [[state education agency|education agencies]] engage students as staff in programs where they make decisions about [[grant making]], [[standardized test|school assessment]], and other areas.&lt;ref&gt;(n.d.) [http://www.k12.wa.us/TitleVpartA/YES/default.aspx Youth Leadership &amp; Service Team] Washington State Office of Supertintendent of Public Instruction&lt;/ref&gt; Students are also participating in [[decision-making]] by establishing and enforcing codes of conduct and in personal education decision-making, such as choosing classes and deciding whether to attend school.

==Worldwide examples==
Education reform has long been the domain of parents, teachers, school administrators and politicians. In some nations, however, there is a growing trend of greater student participation in scholastic affairs.

===Australia===
The ''Connect'' journal, published in Melbourne, features dozens of examples of student voice throughout education in its bi-monthly publication.

The [[Victorian Student Representative Council]] is the umbrella or peak body of Student Councils in Victoria, Australia. It is supported with funding from the Victorian Department of Education and Early Childhood Development (DEECD) and auspiced by the [http://www.yacvic.org.au Youth Affairs Council of Victoria (YACVic)]. The VicSRC is an organisation run by secondary school students, elected by their peers.

The [[New South Wales Student Representative Council]] is the peak student leadership consultative and decision-making forum in [[New South Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schools.nsw.edu.au/studentsupport/studleadsrc/src/secstateactiv/nswsrc.php NSW Department of Education and Communities - NSW Student Representative Council]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
Including student voice on district school boards was mandated by the Ontario Education Act in 1998. Students in each one of the 72 provincial school boards are represented by a 'pupil representative', commonly called "Student Trustee". They are meant to represent the needs and concerns of students in discussions with the school board administration and the province. The [[Ontario Student Trustees' Association]], OSTA-AECO, has become Ontario's chief student stakeholder, providing professional development to its members and advocates for students' educational interests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osta-aeco.org/ OSTA-AECO] website.&lt;/ref&gt; The Society for Democratic Education is an organization in [[Toronto]] that includes many aspects of heightened student inclusion in education reform policy. The Society for Democratic Education was founded in early 2005 by [[Bianca Wylie]]. It has published several essays and position papers that discuss the importance of wide-scale education reform, especially in how it applies to secondary level education and civic education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.activereform.org The Society for Democratic Education] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060202070923/http://activereform.org/ |date=2006-02-02 }} website.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another Canadian organization of note is [[Learning for a Cause]] founded in 2004 by educator and poet Michael Ernest Sweet Learning for a Cause which promotes student voices for social change through creative writing and publishing opportunities for Canadian students.

Provincial governments and Ministries of Education across Canada are also getting on board with student engagement and student voice.  Alberta Education launched Speak Out – the Alberta Student Engagement Initiative in November 2008 and thousands of students have been sharing their ideas on how to improve how education looks and feels for them.

Ontario's [[SpeakUp]] initiative seeks students ideas on what strengthens their engagement in their learning.  Ontario's student voice program is centered on four main initiatives, the Minister's Student Advisory Council (MSAC), SpeakUp projects, SpeakUp in a Box and Student Regional Forums.

The Minister’s Student Advisory Council (MSAC) is composed of sixty students, from Grades 7 to 12, they are selected annually to share their ideas and submit recommendations directly to the Ontario Minister of Education. MSAC also determines the themes for Regional Student Forums taking place during the school year. The members of the Minister's Student Advisory Council have been selected in each year since the inaugural year including 2010, 2011, and 2012. SpeakUp projects are micro-grants for students. Student submit applications for projects they have designed that support the goals of the Student Voice initiative, over 1.2 million dollars in grant money is available yearly. Over 5000 SpeakUp projects have been led since 2008. Regional Student Forums are held across the province where students are invited to explore, discuss, and make recommendations about factors that facilitate/hinder their learning. Last, SpeakUp in a box allows students to hold their own forums for 30 people free of charge with the Ontario Ministry of Education providing the materials to do so. More information is available at SpeakUp.

The [[Calgary Board of Education]], in 2010, launched the Chief Superintendent's Student Advisory Council – a group of high school students with student representation from each of the Calgary Board of Education's high school programs. They meet regularly with the Calgary Board of Education's Chief Superintendent, Naomi Johnson, to discuss issues in the system and propose solutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbe.ab.ca/New/feature/Werklund/EmpoweringStudentVoice.pdf Empowering Student Voice Information Package]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Student Voice Initiative is a national movement in Canada to give students a voice in their education. Student Voice Initiative operates on a foundation of support from policy-makers, school administrators, academics, and students from across North America and the world in support of giving students a greater voice in their own education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://studentvoicei.org]&lt;/ref&gt;  The core mandate of the organization arose from the success of the 'student trustee' position within the Ontario education community, which has fostered a student leadership framework ranging from student councils at every school, to student senates and student trustees at the regional or district school board level, to the formation of a provincial stakeholder in the Ontario Student Trustees' Association.

===Chile===
A powerful example of student voice in school improvement comes from the [[2006 student protests in Chile]]. Throughout the spring of that year, public high school students from across the country began a series of protests, school takeovers, and negotiations designed to bolster support for public education improvement. After seeing the massive effect of the students, government officials met their demands and are working to support ongoing reforms as necessitated by students.

The government's failure at meeting the core student proposals triggered the biggest social [[2011 student protests in Chile|protests in Chile]] since the return of democracy, in 2011.

===United Kingdom===
England has had a long history of student voice, from [[Robert Owen]]'s school in New Lanark (allowing the children to direct their learning through questioning, 1816) to Neillie Dick's&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.educationrevolution.org/neldicandmod.html Chris Mercogliano] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100703022332/http://www.educationrevolution.org/neldicandmod.html |date=2010-07-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; anarchist school in Whitechapel (set-up by her in 1908 aged 13); [[A.

The most extensive, sustained programme of student voice research in the UK was carried out by the late Professor Jean Rudduck (Faculty of Education, University of Cambridge)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.educ.cam.ac.uk/people/formermembers/rudduck/]&lt;/ref&gt; and Jean's pioneering work spanned 20 years, helping to establish the principles of student consultation and student participation in practice, policy and research. Jean co-ordinated the ESRC Teaching and Learning Research Programme's Network Project, 'Consulting Pupils about Teaching and Learning'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.consultingpupils.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; and her work has had a profound influence on the student voice movement, both in the UK and beyond.

[[English Secondary Students' Association|StudentVoice]] is the representative body for secondary students in England. It aims to support students in expressing their views about education by providing workshops and a network of support with other secondary school students. The National College for School Leadership provides career-long learning and development opportunities, professional and practical support for England's existing and aspiring school leaders. Their goal is to ensure that school leaders have the skills, recognition, capacity and ambition to transform the school education system into the best in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncsl.org.uk NCSL] website.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Phoenix Education Trust supports democratic education and helped to found StudentVoice It aims to explore and support education in which children are trusted and respected and their participation in decision-making is encouraged.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phoenixeducation.co.uk Phoenix] website.&lt;/ref&gt; involver supports schools to develop sustainable structures for effective student voice, school councils and participation, and work with teachers and pupils in primary, secondary and special schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.involver.org.uk involver] website.&lt;/ref&gt; involver provides training, resources, ongoing support and access to a large UK network of schools.

Some state schools are also pushing student Voice internally and independently across the UK. Schools like [[Quintin Kynaston Community Academy]] are now recognised for having one of the largest and most active Student Voice 'faculties' in the country.

===Ireland===
In Ireland, the Irish Second-Level Students' Union (ISSU) is the national umbrella body for second-level school Student Councils.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.issu.ie The Irish Second-Level Students' Union] website.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===

Many national organizations and media outlets across the United States have addressed student voice recently, including [[KQED]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Can Students Have More Say in School Decisions?|url=http://blogs.kqed.org/mindshift/2014/10/how-can-students-have-more-say-in-school-decisions/}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edutopia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Including Student Voice|url=http://www.edutopia.org/blog/sammamish-2-including-student-voice-bill-palmer}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Washington Post]], and others. They are finding organizations like Student Voice, What Kids Can Do and SoundOut, as well as local efforts happening across the country.

SoundOut is an international organization that has promoted student voice since it was founded in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Website for student voice and empowerment|url=http://phennd.org/update/new-website-for-student-voice-and-empowerment/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to projects across North America&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://soundout.org/aboutus.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011135533/http://www.soundout.org/aboutus.html|archivedate=2014-10-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and numerous academic citations of their works, SoundOut has also been recognized by [[UNICEF]] as "a helpful organization that focuses on promoting student voice in 
schools."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rights Respecting Schools|url=http://rrscanada.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/rrs-workshop-3-facilitator-guide_unicef.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; SoundOut's founder, [[Adam Fletcher (activist)|Adam Fletcher]], is author of ''The Guide to Student Voice'' and the forthcoming ''Meaningful Student Involvement Handbook''. The organization has also published several works related to meaningful student involvement, students on [[school boards]], and student voice.

[http://www.stuvoice.org Student Voice] is a nationwide grassroots organization that works to unite and elevate the student voice. Through the use of [https://twitter.com/Stu_Voice their @Stu_Voice Twitter page], thousands have come together to speak out using the #StuVoice hashtag during weekly Student Voice chats. Student Voice allows any student to publish blog posts on their [https://web.archive.org/web/20121231183938/http://www.stuvoice.org/category/student-posts/ website], providing a platform for their voices to be heard.  Student Voice hosted the first-ever student voice summit on April 13, 2013 in New York City.&lt;ref name="Student Voice website"&gt;{{cite web|title=StuVoice.org|url=http://www.stuvoice.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[What Kids Can Do]] shares stories of student voice throughout the educational process, both within the school system and throughout the community. Their highlights emphasize exceptional learning, belonging, and engagement of students in a variety of capacities for a variety of purposes, the greatest of which is in order to promote student voice. WKCD has authored several books about student voice, primarily written by [[Kathleen Cushman]] working with high school students, including ''Fires in the Bathroom: Advice from high schools students for teachers'' and ''Sent to the Principal's Office''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whatkidscando.org WKCD] website.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[High School Survey of Student Engagement]] works with high schools across the country to capture students' beliefs and experiences, and strengthen student engagement in schools. Their work is used nationally to influence school policy making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HSSSE|url=http://ceep.indiana.edu/hssse|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100310052319/http://ceep.indiana.edu/hssse/|archivedate=2010-03-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An organization in Minnesota called "Education|Evolving" integrates student voices with current major topics in education policy and maintains an online clearinghouse of student voices on education policy. Their website also has students describing the learning experiences on video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Student Voice|url=http://www.educationevolving.org/studentvoices}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Quaglia Institute for Student Aspirations promotes student voice as well, teaching schools in Maine how to engage learners in different ways.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Framework Student Voice|url=http://www.qisa.org/framework/students.jsp}}&lt;/ref&gt; while UP For Learning in Vermont implements programs across the state to support deep student voice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Up For Learning|url=http://www.upforlearning.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Prichard Committee for Academic Excellence]] in Kentucky also has a [[Student Voice Team]] promoting the concept statewide by working with policymakers and educators, as well as students and parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prichard Committee Student Voice Team|url=http://www.prichardcommittee.org/our-advocacy-focus/engage-and-amplify-student-voices-in-education-policy-development}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International===
The [[OBESSU|Organising Bureau of European School Student Unions (OBESSU)]] is the body which connects school student unions in [[secondary education]] across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.obessu.org/obessu|accessdate=2015-01-26|title=OBESSU - About us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outcomes==
Student voice is increasingly identified as a pillar of successful [[school reform]], as educational researchers, academic institutions, and educational support organizations around the world increasingly advocate for the inclusion of students in the reform process after identifying student voice as a vital element of [[student engagement]].&lt;ref&gt;Newmann, F. (1993) ''Student Engagement in American Schools.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Critical educators including [[bell hooks]], [[Paulo Freire]], and [[Henry Giroux]] have voiced concern with the singular notion of a student voice. [[Adam Fletcher (activist)|Adam Fletcher]], an internationally recognized expert on student voice, has written about this over-simplification, saying that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is not enough to simply listen to student voice. Educators have an ethical imperative to do something with students, and that is why meaningful student involvement is vital to school improvement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soundout.org/MSIResearch.pdf Meaningful Student Involvement Research Guide] Adam Fletcher, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This is echoed by other advocates, including Sam Levin. Levin was an eleventh grade student in Massachusetts when he worked with adults at [[Monument Mountain Regional High School]] and his peers to establish an independent learning program for high school students. In a 2014 article in the ''[[Washington Post]]'', Levin wrote,

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Students don't need a voice... The change involves giving something to students, but it's not a voice. Students already have a voice. They have student senates, and student advisory committees. When people talk about student voice, they're talking about feedback sessions and letting students be part of hiring committees. When they say, 'Let's give students a voice,' they mean, 'let's give them a seat at school board meetings.' ...Don't give them a voice. Give them our schools."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Students don't need a 'voice.' Here's what they really need|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/wp/2014/04/16/students-dont-need-a-voice-heres-what-they-really-need/|author=Valerie Strauss|date=April 16, 2014|work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Studying in an educational context refers to the process of gaining mastery of a certain area of information.
'''Study software''' then is any program which allows students to improve the time they spend thinking about, learning and studying that information.

More specifically study software's objective is to increase the effective application of efficacious [[Study Skills|study skills]] to that information, such that thinking and learning about that information is more productive per unit time.

Different subjects being studied may benefit from a different spread of study skills being applied. [[Mathematics]] requires a somewhat different set of study skills to the skill required to learn a [[language]].

Some types of study software are subject specific teachers of material and may or may not contain the information/content that requires mastery.

Study software therefore is a blanket for a variety of overlapping software types.

==Origins==
[[Education]] has of course been a road to a better life and so the drive for improvement has been universal from students.
Students in most [[United States]]
and [[Nepal]] institutions are not taught how to study/learn specifically. Yet there is now hard evidence for some methods for study/learning being superior to others, and that there is benefit in teaching 'study skills' themselves.

Study software to a degree, seeks to circumvent this problem, by causing the student to follow good practices, through the use of the software, without necessarily having to know about the background science of [[memory]] and [[learning]].

Historically the most successful types of study software include [[mindmapping]] and [[flashcard]] software programs. Both independently have been proven to improve learning. Mapping software's claimed strengths are more at the thinking end of the spectrum of study and are criticized for their lack of efficacy once the benefits of organizing information are finished. Flashcard software's strengths are more at the learning end of the spectrum of study and are criticized as being for rote learning only.

A more recently arrived group is [[notetaking software]].

There are also hybrids of the above broad types available, including ones that can actually test students on their notes.

==Benefits==
Benefits that the various types of study software might confer include various mixtures of:

# Offers variety of different information together (picture, sound, music, diagram, ...)
# Improved access to variety of information - see [[databases]]
# Makes making notes efficient (tablet friendly 'Microsoft ink functionality', speech recognition)
# Notes are (made to be) easy to remember - colors, pictures, diagrams or [[mindmap]]ping
# Use of [[hypertext]] to connect related information
# Testing, reviews and tracking of knowledge - '[[spacing effect]]'

==Barriers==
Barriers to the use of study software include:

# Requires hardware, and in some cases electronic access to the content, and neither might be available.
# Some level of skill may be needed to use the hardware required by the software. Learning may be delayed by the need of skills such as [[typing]], using a [[Mouse (computing)|mouse]], pointing on a [[touch-sensitive]] screen, or other skills required to handle the hardware.
# Costs of hardware, software, and salaries, combined with low budgets in some schools, may limit the availability and usefulness for the study resources.
# Programs don't communicate together as they could (see [[Unix philosophy]]). Self-contained programs either don't offer enough features (e.g. calculation of the [[spacing effect]] to learn faster) or offer more than they should ([[Software bloat]]).
# Content might differ significantly in different countries.

==Future==
A number of converging trends make it extremely likely that study software will become ubiquitous within 10 years.

'''Supply of the enabling technologies will improve'''.

Trends include: Improvements in battery technology, head worn sound and visual displays, input devices, speech recognition, handwriting recognition will allow mobile computing to become the norm. There are no more 'basic breakthroughs' needed in any of these areas before wearable computers become a given in the near future.
Broadband access, especially wireless will mean that the normal state of affairs for a student will be to be online at a moment's notice.
Ultimately the computer will be a constantly worn companion for a typical student.

'''Demand for the service will increase'''.

With physical goods becoming cheaper, and less labour-intensive, increasing emphasis on 'services' as a valuable labor commodity throughout the world will mean that higher and higher levels of education, with increased competition for places, will require improvements in learning efficiency that can only be brought about through the application of specialized study software to the problem.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15971">'''Teacher retention''' is a field of education research that focuses on how factors such as school characteristics and teacher [[Demography|demographics]] affect whether teachers stay in their schools, move to different schools, or leave the profession before [[retirement]]. The field developed in response to a perceived [[shortage]] in the education [[Labour economics|labor market]] in the 1990s. Teacher attrition is thought to be higher in low income schools and in high need subjects like math, science, and [[special education]]. More recent evidence suggests that school culture and leadership has the most significant effect on teacher decisions to stay or leave.

== Factors==

=== Schools  ===
Researchers and policy makers have identified some commonalities across schools and districts that affect teacher retention.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Teacher turnover and teacher shortages: An organizational analysis.|last = Ingersoll|first = Richard M.|date = 2001|journal = [[American Educational Research Journal]]|volume= 38|issue=3|pages=499–534 |doi = |pmid = |access-date = |url=http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1093&amp;context=gse_pubs }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Some school factors are "push" factors that push teachers to leave their current school or the profession. Other school factors are "pull" factors that encourage teachers to stay in their current school.


==== Push factors ====
Certain factors are linked to teachers leaving schools or leaving the profession before retirement. Researchers have used data from school districts and national [[survey methodology|surveys]] of teachers and schools to demonstrate that there are common factors that push teachers to either leave their schools or leave the profession. The most significant factors include low salary, student behavior issues, lack of support from school administration, and inability to participate in decision-making.{{Cite journal|title = Teacher turnover and teacher shortages: An organizational analysis.|last = Ingersoll|first = Richard M.|date = 2001|journal = [[American Educational Research Journal]]|volume= 38|issue=3|pages=499–534 |doi = |pmid = |access-date = |url=http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1093&amp;context=gse_pubs }}&lt;/ref&gt; Teachers may also be more likely to leave if they are resistant to using prescribed curriculums or are discouraged from modifying their instruction.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = (In)Fidelity: What the resistance of new teachers reveals about professional principles and prescriptive educational practices|author1=Achinstein, B.  |author2=Ogawa, R. T |lastauthoramp=yes |date = 2006|journal = Harvard Educational Review|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, individual school environments affect teacher attrition more than [[School district|district]] measures like teacher salary, student demographics, or [[Urban area|urban]] settings.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Toward a more nuanced understanding of teacher attrition|last = DeAngelis &amp; Presley|date = 2011|journal = Education and Urban Society|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Pull factors ====
Other factors encourage teachers to stay at their current school. Teachers are more likely to stay in [[Elementary school|elementary]] schools than [[Middle school|middle]] or [[high school]]s.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Raue, K., Gray, L., &amp; O’Rear, I. (2015). Career Paths of Beginning Public School Teachers. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2015/2015196.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Teachers who earn at least $40,000 per year are most likely to stay through their fifth year at the same school.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Teachers stay longer in schools that have missions in alignment with the teacher’s personal mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Finding the right fit: Recruiting and retaining teachers in Milwaukee choice schools|last = Egalite, A. J., Jensen, L. I., Stewart, T., &amp; Wolf, P. J.|date = 2012|journal = Journal of School Choice|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most successful strategies used to retain teachers includes [[Mentorship|mentoring]] and teacher teaming.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The wrong solution to the teacher shortage|author1=Ingersoll, R.  |author2=Smith, T. |lastauthoramp=yes |date = 2003|journal = Educational Leadership|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others point to the importance of teachers being treated as professionals who are trusted and [[Collaboration|collaborate]] with one another to meet student needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Stayers, leavers, lovers, dreamers: Insights about teacher retention|last = Cochran-Smith|first = Marilyn|date = 2004|journal = Journal of Teacher Education|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; These professional practices can include individuality, creativity, high expectations for students, and [[community building]] with mentors or [[peer group|peers]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Teachers are also more likely to stay when they report being satisfied with their school.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; School location and student demographics are not major factors in either pushing teachers away or pulling them in.

=== Teacher factors  ===
Researchers and policy makers have also collected information about teacher demographics to better understand teachers' choices to stay or leave their schools. Most studies include research on teacher age and gender as well as teacher qualifications.

==== Age and gender ====
Teachers are most likely to stay in their schools if they are between the ages of 30-50.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Teachers under 30 are more likely to move schools within districts, move districts, or move to other states to teach. Younger teachers often still have preliminary credentials which allows them more flexibility within states as states often have their own standardized licensure and testing requirements that discourage teachers from moving. Younger teachers are also less likely to be vested in their pension systems and more likely to move districts before choosing a district which may offer a higher salary or better benefits and retirement options.&lt;ref&gt;Goldhaber, D., Grout, C., Holden, K. L., &amp; Brown, N. (2015). Crossing the Border? Exploring the Cross-State Mobility of the Teacher Workforce. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.caldercenter.org/sites/default/files/WP%20143.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Salary increases can draw younger teachers to particular districts with the promise of higher payment for teaching in the long term.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Imazeki, J. (2005). Teacher salaries and teacher attrition. ''Economics of Education Review;'' 24, 431–449.&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between life cycle events such as marriage or having children and teacher attrition can be difficult to measure, but teachers who leave the profession are more likely to have recently had children.&lt;ref&gt;Boe, E. E., Bobbitt, S. A., Cook, L. H., Whitener, S. D., &amp; Weber, A. L. (1997). Why didst thou go? Predictors of retention, transfer, and attrition of special and general education teachers from a national perspective. ''The Journal of Special Education'', ''30''(4), 390–411.&lt;/ref&gt; Teachers with children under 5 are increasingly likely to leave the profession. Gender also plays a role in this trend: young female teachers are more likely than young male teachers to leave.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Women who leave the profession are also more likely to return to teaching than men.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Teachers over 50 are also more likely to leave the profession, but this is generally explained by teachers who are closer to retirement.

==== Qualifications ====
Researchers are examining teacher preparation in relation to retention, including the quality of higher education curriculum and student teaching experiences. Mentorships and inductions have been shown to help early-career teachers and other educators adapt and stay in the job&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Learning First|first1=Alliance|title=The Educator Pipeline|url=http://www.learningfirst.org/sites/learningfirst/files/LFA-educator-shortage-V5%20(2)%20(1).pdf|website=www.learningfirst.org|publisher=Learning First Alliance|accessdate=14 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Teachers with better academic qualifications including grades, test scores, [[Postgraduate education|graduate degrees]], and [[Undergraduate education|undergraduate]] college selectivity are more likely to leave the profession. There is no major retention difference between teachers who completed traditional preparation programs and teachers who completed [[Alternative teacher certification|alternative certification]] programs, like [[Teach For America|Teach for America]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Teachers are more likely to stay when students are high achieving.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Boyd, D., Grossman, P., Lankford, H., Loeb, S., &amp; Wyckoff, J. (2008). ''Who leaves? Teacher attrition and student achievement''. National Bureau of Economic Research. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.nber.org/papers/w14022&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Teachers with certain teaching qualifications and teaching assignments are more likely to leave their schools or the profession. Special education teachers are not more likely to leave teaching, but they are more likely to transfer to positions as general educators.&lt;ref&gt;Boe, E. E., Bobbitt, S. A., &amp; Cook, L. H. (1997). Whither didst thou go? Retention, reassignment, migration, and attrition of special and general education teachers from a national perspective. ''The Journal of Special Education'', ''30''(4), 371–389.&lt;/ref&gt; Elementary teachers are more likely to stay than middle and high school teachers. Teacher who [[Self-efficacy|feel effective]] in their jobs are also more likely to continue teaching.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Teacher retention: Teacher characteristics, school characteristics, organizational characteristics, and teacher efficacy.|last = Hughes|first = Gail D.|date = 2012|journal = The Journal of Education Research|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Retaining teachers of color ==

Retaining [[Person of color|teachers of color]] is an important element of teacher retention. Students of color perform better with race congruent teachers of color&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; and American students are increasingly non white. In 2014 50.3% of American public school students were [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latino]], [[Asian American|Asian]], and [[African American|African-American]] with demographic data suggesting that the percentage of students of color will continue to grow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Digest of Education Statistics, 2013|url = http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d13/tables/dt13_203.50.asp|website = nces.ed.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some evidence suggests that teachers of color have higher attrition rates than white teachers and other evidence suggests the opposite.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Teachers of color are more likely to stay in a school in which they are led and supervised by administrators of color. Overall, 84% of white teachers have a race matched principal while only 44% of Black teachers have a race matched principal and 8% of other races have a matched principal. Teachers with a race matched principal are more likely to report earning additional pay, feeling autonomy, and experiencing additional support, all of which are linked to overall teacher retention. Race matched teachers are also more likely to report being satisfied with their jobs.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grissom, J. A., &amp; Keiser, L. R. (2011). A supervisor like me: Race, representation, and the satisfaction and turnover decisions of public sector employees. ''Journal of Policy Analysis &amp; Management, 30''(3), 557-580.&lt;/ref&gt; Race matching also affects exits from the profession more than transfers to another school. Also, white men are more likely to leave the profession when there are more students of color. In contrast, teachers of color have higher exit rates overall but are less likely to leave when they have more non white students.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Retaining effective teachers ==

Federal policy initiatives during the [[Obama Administration]] have emphasized the importance of retaining effective teachers, rather than just working to retain all teachers. This is partly due to [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] and the [[United States Department of Education]]’s [[Race to the Top]] initiative which granted money to states pledging to institute policies which retained and released teachers based in part on their evaluations.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Building a Better Teacher|last = Green|first = Elizabeth|publisher = W.W. Norton &amp; Company|year = 2015|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The measurement of teacher success is often based on “value added” determinations based on student [[standardized test]] scores. Value-added measurements assess the effect of a teacher on student test scores by quantifying teacher ability. These measurements are seen by some as “noisy” and only partly a measure of teacher performance, but still useful.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Winters, M. A., &amp; Cowen, J. M. (2013). Who would stay, who would be dismissed? An empirical consideration of value-added teacher retention policies. ''Educational Researcher, 42''(6), 330-337.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Educational Research Association|American Education Research Association]] cautions against using value added models in most situations due to scientific and technical limitations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = AERA Issues Statement on the Use of Value-Added Models in Evaluation  of Educators and Educator Preparation Programs|url = http://www.aera.net/Newsroom/NewsReleasesandStatements/AERAIssuesStatementontheUseofValue-AddedModelsinEvaluationofEducatorsandEducatorPreparationPrograms/tabid/16120/Default.aspx|website = www.aera.net|accessdate = 2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Race to the Top incentives represented a major shift in how districts and administrators evaluated and retained teachers. Prior to Race to the Top, teacher effectiveness had been determined by years of experience and years of graduate study. Now, in many states, [[Value-added modeling|value added modeling]] is used alongside principal evaluations of teacher observations and teacher progress on student learning outcomes. One controversial use of value-added teacher evaluation was in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington D.C.]] under the leadership of [[Michelle Rhee]].&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Dee, T., &amp; Wyckoff, J. (2013). ''Incentives, selection, and teacher performance: Evidence from IMPACT''. Paper presented at the Economics of Education, Munich.&lt;/ref&gt; The D.C. program was unique in rewarding high performing teachers with higher salaries and bonus pay while also threatening to dismiss low performing teachers. Teachers in D.C. under threat of dismissal made greater gains in their teaching practice than teachers who stood to gain financially. The dismissal threat also increased voluntary attrition of lower performing teachers by 50%.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Statistics suggest that having a top performing teacher rather than a low performing teacher “four years in a row would be enough to close the black-white test score gap.”&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Teacher effectiveness has also been linked to how often teachers move schools. Overall, leavers are less effective than movers. More effective teachers are more likely to stay in the same schools, unless they being their careers in lower performing schools.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Teachers with low performing students are more likely to leave their schools in the first 1–2 years. Low performing teachers are more likely to move to schools that are similar to the schools they currently teach in, while higher performing teachers will move from low performing schools to higher performing schools.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This evidence indicates that some teacher attrition may be beneficial to students.

The GRADE approach (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) is a method of assessing the certainty in evidence (also known as quality of evidence or confidence in effect estimates) and the strength of recommendations in health care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = [[Holger Jens Schünemann|Schünemann]] | first1 = HJ | last2 = Best | first2 = D | last3 = Vist | first3 = G | last4 = Oxman | first4 = AD | year = 2003 | title = Letters, numbers, symbols, and words: How best to communicate grades of evidence and recommendations? | url = | journal = Canadian Medical Association Journal | volume = 169 | issue = 7| pages = 677–80 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It provides a structured and transparent evaluation of the importance of outcomes of alternative management strategies, acknowledgment of patients and the public values and preferences, and comprehensive criteria for downgrading and upgrading certainty in evidence. It has important implications for those summarizing evidence for systematic reviews, health technology assessments, and clinical practice guidelines as well as other decision makers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guyatt|first1=GH|last2=Oxman|first2=AD|last3=Vist|first3=GE|last4=Kunz|first4=R|last5=Falck-Ytter|first5=Y|last6=Alonso-Coello|first6=P|last7=[[Holger Jens Schünemann|Schünemann]]|first7=HJ|title=GRADE: an emerging consensus on rating quality of evidence and strength of recommendation|journal=BMJ|date=2008|volume=336|pages=924–26|doi=10.1136/bmj.39489.470347.ad|pmid=18436948|pmc=2335261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and history==
Judgments about evidence and recommendations in healthcare are complex. Healthcare evidence and subsequent recommendations leave decision makers with differing degrees of certainty in that evidence. Sources of evidence range from small laboratory studies or case reports to well-designed large randomized controlled trials that have minimized bias to a great extent. The GRADE began in the year 2000 as a collaboration of methodologists, guideline developers, biostatisticians, clinicians, public health scientists and other interested members. GRADE developed and implemented a common, transparent and sensible approach to grading the quality of evidence (also known as certainty in evidence or confidence in effect estimates) and strength of recommendations in healthcare&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guyatt|first1=GH|last2=Oxman|first2=AD|last3=[[Holger Jens Schünemann|Schünemann]]|first3=HJ|last4=Tugwell|first4=P|last5=Knotterus|first5=A|title=GRADE guidelines: A new series of articles in the Journal of Clinical Epidemiology|journal=Journal of Clinical Epidemiology|volume=64|pages=380–382|doi=10.1016/j.jclinepi.2010.09.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [http://www.gradeworkinggroup.org]
The GRADE approach separates recommendations following from an evaluation of the evidence as strong or weak. A recommendations to use, or not use an option (e.g. an intervention), should be based on the trade-offs between desirable consequences of following a recommendation on the one hand, and undesirable consequences on the other (Table 2). If desirable consequences outweigh undesirable consequences, decision makers will recommend an option and vice versa. The uncertainty associated with the trade-off between the desirable and undesirable consequences will determine the strength of recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Andrews|first1=J|last2=Guyatt|first2=GH|last3=Oxman|first3=AD|last4=Alderson|first4=P|last5=Dahm|first5=P|last6=Falck-Ytter|first6=Y|last7=Nasser|first7=M|last8=Meerpohl|first8=J|last9=Post|first9=PN|last10=Kunz|first10=R|last11=Brozek|first11=J|last12=Vist|first12=G|last13=Rind|first13=D|last14=Akl|first14=EA|last15=[[Holger Jens Schünemann|Schünemann]]|first15=HJ|title=GRADE guidelines: 15. Going from evidence to recommendations: the significance and presentation of recommendations|journal=Journal of Clinical Epidemiology|volume=66|pages=719–725|doi=10.1016/j.jclinepi.2012.03.013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The criteria that determine this balance of consequences are listed in Table 2. Furthermore, it provides decision-makers (e.g. clinicians, other health care providers, patients and policy makers) with a guide to using those recommendations in clinical practice, public health and policy. To achieve simplicity, the GRADE approach classifies the quality of evidence in one of four levels—high, moderate, low, and very low (Table 1).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Balshem|first1=H|last2=Helfand|first2=M|last3=[[Holger Jens Schünemann|Schünemann]]|first3=HJ|last4=Oxman|first4=AD|last5=Kunz|first5=R|last6=Brozek|first6=J|last7=Vist|first7=GE|last8=Falck-Ytter|first8=Y|last9=Meerpohl|first9=J|last10=Norris|first10=S|last11=Guyatt|first11=GH|title=GRADE guidelines 3: rating the quality of evidence - introduction|journal=Journal of Clinical Epidemiology|volume=64|pages=401–406|doi=10.1016/j.jclinepi.2010.07.015|pmid=21208779|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GRADE working group has developed a software application that facilitates the use of the approach, allows the development of summary tables and contains the GRADE handbook. The software is free for non-profit organizations and is available at http://www.gradepro.org
The GRADE approach to assess the certainty in evidence is widely applicable, including to questions about diagnosis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = [[Holger Jens Schünemann|Schünemann]] | first1 = HJ | last2 = Oxman | first2 = AD | last3 = Brozek | first3 = J | last4 = Glasziou | first4 = P | last5 = Jaeschke | first5 = R | last6 = Vist | first6 = G | last7 = Williams | first7 = J | last8 = Kunz | first8 = R | last9 = Craig | first9 = J | last10 = Montori | first10 = V | last11 = Bossuyt | first11 = P | last12 = Guyatt | first12 = GH | year = 2008 | title = GRADEing the quality of evidence and strength of recommendations for diagnostic tests and strategies | url = | journal = BMJ | volume = 336 | issue = | pages = 1106–1110 | doi=10.1136/bmj.39500.677199.ae}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brozek | first1 = JL | last2 = Akl | first2 = EA | last3 = Jaeschke | first3 = R | last4 = Lang | first4 = DM | last5 = Bossuyt | first5 = P | last6 = Glasziou | first6 = P | last7 = Helfand | first7 = M | last8 = Ueffing | first8 = E | last9 = Alonso-Coello | first9 = P | last10 = Meerpohl | first10 = J | last11 = Phillips | first11 = B | last12 = Horvath | first12 = AR | last13 = Bousquet | first13 = J | last14 = Guyatt | first14 = GH | last15 = [[Holger Jens Schünemann|Schünemann]] | first15 = HJ | year = 2009 | title = Grading quality of evidence and strength of recommendations in clinical practice guidelines: part 2 of 3.

==Current practice==
Over 100 organizations (including the [[World Health Organization]], the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the Canadian Task Force for Preventive Health Care, the Colombian Ministry of Health, among others) have endorsed and/or are using GRADE to evaluate the quality of evidence and strength of health care recommendations. (See examples of clinical practice guidelines using GRADE at https://gradepro.org/resources/#guidelines; https://www.moh.gov.sa/endepts/Proofs/Pages/Guidelines.aspx)

Table 2. Factors and criteria that determine the direction and strength of a recommendation
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Factor and criteria* !! How the factor influences the direction and strength of a recommendation
|-
| Problem 
This factor can be integrated with the balance of the benefits and harms and burden.
 || The problem is determined by the importance and frequency of the health care issue that is addressed (burden of disease, prevalence or baseline risk). If the problem is of great importance a strong recommendation is more likely.
|-
| Values and preferences || This describes how important health outcomes are to those affected, how variable they are and if there is uncertainty about this. The less variability or uncertainty there is about values and preferences for the critical or important outcomes, the more likely is a strong recommendation.
|-
| Quality of the evidence || The confidence in any estimate of the criteria determining the direction and strength of the recommendation will determine if a strong or conditional recommendation is offered. However, the overall quality that is assigned to the recommendation is that of the evidence about effects on population-important outcomes. The higher the quality of evidence the more likely is a strong recommendation. 
|-
| Benefits and harms and burden || This requires an evaluation of the absolute effects of both the benefits and harms and their importance. The greater the net benefit or net harm the more likely is a strong recommendation for or against the option.
|-
| Resource implications || This describes how resource intense an option is, if it is cost-effective and if there is incremental benefit. The more advantageous or clearly disadvantageous these resource implications are the more likely is a strong recommendation. 
|-
| Equity
This factor is often addressed under values preferences, and frequently also includes resource considerations
|| The greater the likelihood to reduce inequities or increase equity and the more accessible an option is, the more likely is a strong recommendation. 
|-
| Acceptability 
This factor can be integrated with the balance of the benefits and harms and burden.
 || The greater the acceptability of an option to all or most stakeholders, the more likely is a strong recommendation.
|-
| Feasibility 
This factor includes considerations about values and preferences, and resource implications.
 || The greater the acceptability of an option to all or most stakeholders, the more likely is a strong recommendation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6365">In larger school systems, a head teacher principal is often assisted by someone known as a vice-principal, deputy principal, or assistant principal. Unlike the principal, the vice-principal does not have quite the decision-making authority that the principal carries. Although they still carry nearly the same authority among students, vice-principals do not have the same power on the board. Experience as an assistant principal is often a prerequisite for advancement to a principalship.

==Job description==
&lt;blockquote&gt;Assistant principals aid the principal in the overall administration of the school. Some assistant principals hold this position for several years to prepare for advancement to principal jobs; others are career assistant principals. They are primarily responsible for scheduling student classes, ordering textbooks and supplies, and coordinating transportation, custodial, cafeteria, and other support services. They usually handle student discipline and attendance problems, social and recreational programs, and health and safety matters. They also may counsel students on personal, educational, or vocational matters. With the advent of site-based management, assistant principals are playing a greater role in ensuring the academic success of students by helping to develop new curricula, evaluating teachers, and dealing with school-community relations—responsibilities previously assumed solely by the principal. The number of assistant principals that a school employs may vary, depending on the number of students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2010–11 Edition |chapter=Education Administrators |chapter-url=https://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos007.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219002203/https://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos007.htm |archive-date=19 February 2012 |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=[[Bureau of Labor Statistics]], [[United States Department of Labor]] |access-date=4 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Education==
Most schools require elementary, middle, and high school principals to have a master’s degree in education administration or leadership.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/ooh/Management/Elementary-middle-and-high-school-principals.htm#tab-4 Elementary, Middle, and High School Principals : Occupational Outlook Handbook : U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Most principals also have experience as teachers. [[Master's degrees]] in educational administration are offered at a number of [[universities]] around the [[United States]] including the [[University of North Texas]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unt.edu/pais/grad/geadm.htm UNT | Graduate Studies | College of Education | Masters of Educational Leadership&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ball State University]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://cms.bsu.edu/academics/collegesanddepartments/distance/academics/programs/graduate/masters/maedadmin] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130215092536/http://cms.bsu.edu/academics/collegesanddepartments/distance/academics/programs/graduate/masters/maedadmin |date=February 15, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Drexel University]], [[Ashland University]], [[Northeastern University]], and the [[University of Scranton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Master of Science in Educational Administration|url=http://www.uscranton.com/online-educational-administration/|publisher=[[University of Scranton]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Duties==
In American schools, it is often his or her duty to handle matters such as student discipline, parent conference meetings, asset inventory and ordering, school improvement planning, bus and lunch supervision, and teacher observations. Additionally, assistant principals frequently serve as testing coordinators, training staff on procedures related to standardized assessment, as well as accounting for testing materials.{{Or|date=December 2007}} In addition to these duties, assistant principals are instructional leaders.

Most importantly however, in the event that something happens to the principal, such as an extended leave of absence, the assistant principal would act as the interim principal. Because of this, many see this position as a stepping-stone to the larger role of principal and is often used as such.  In most schools, the vice principal forgoes all teaching duties in order to address broader educational issues.

In the United Kingdom, most secondary schools have Assistant Principals (or traditionally known as Assistant Head Teachers), with the Vice-Principals (or traditionally known as Deputy Head Teachers) managing them. Their duties vary from school to school; however, usually Assistant Principals and Vice-Principals support school initiatives in maintaining standards, behavior, Key Stages 3–5, teaching and exam timetabling, inclusion, the curriculum and student learning, and overall accountability in the school. They can also carry out performance appraisals and teacher observations.  Furthermore, principals/head teachers/headmasters/headmistresses are beginning to have more autonomy on how they will structure their school's senior leadership team and what each member's role will be. These additional roles that are found in English secondary schools can lead to senior leadership/administrative teams to be as large as 8–12 people, depending on the school's size and its demographics (e.g., Head Teacher, 2–4 Deputy Head Teachers, 3–8 Assistant Head Teachers). In contrast to the US, most Assistant Head Teachers and Deputy Head Teachers teach 1–2 courses on top of their administrative duties.
