'''Apostolos K. Doxiadis''' ({{lang-el|Απόστολος Κ. Δοξιάδης}}; born 1953) is a Greek writer. He is best known for his international bestsellers ''[[Uncle Petros and Goldbach's Conjecture]]'' (2000) and ''[[Logicomix]]'' (2009).

==Early life==
Doxiadis was born in Australia, where his father, the architect [[Constantinos Apostolou Doxiadis]] was working. Soon after his birth, the family returned to Athens, where Doxiadis grew up. Though his earliest interests were in poetry, fiction and the theatre, an intense interest in mathematics led Doxiadis to leave school at age fifteen, to attend [[Columbia University]], in [[New York City|New York]], from which he obtained a bachelor's degree in Mathematics in May 1972. He then attended the [[École Pratique des Hautes Études]] in [[Paris]] from which he got a master's degree, with a thesis on the mathematical modeling of the nervous system. His father’s death and family reasons made him return to Greece in 1975, interrupting his graduate studies. In Greece, although involved for some years with the computer software industry, Doxiadis returned to his childhood and adolescence loves of theatre and the cinema, before becoming a full-time writer.

==Work==

===Fiction in Greek===
Doxiadis began to write in Greek. His first published work was ''A Parallel Life'' (''Βίος Παράλληλος'', 1985), a novella set in the monastic communities of 4th century CE Egypt. His first novel, ''Makavettas'' (''Μακαβέττας'', 1988), recounted the adventures of a fictional power-hungry colonel at the time of the [[Greek military junta of 1967–1974]]. Written in a tongue-in-cheek imitation of Greek folk military memoirs, such as that of [[Yannis Makriyannis]], it follows the plot of Shakespeare’s ''[[Macbeth]]'', of which the eponymous hero’s name is a Hellenized form. Doxiadis next novel, ''Uncle Petros and Goldbach’s Conjecture'' (''Ο Θείος Πέτρος και η Εικασία του Γκόλντμπαχ'', 1992), was the first long work of fiction whose plot takes place in the world of pure mathematics research. The first Greek critics did not find the mathematical themes appealing, and it received mediocre reviews, unlike Doxiadis’s first two works, which were well received. Τhe novella ''The Three Little Men'' (''Τα Τρία Ανθρωπάκια'', 1998), attempts a modern-day retelling of the tale of a classic fairy-tale.

===Fiction in English===
In 1998, Doxiadis translated into English, significantly re-working, his third novel, which was published in England in 2000 as ''[[Uncle Petros and Goldbach's Conjecture]]'' (UK publisher: [[Faber and Faber]]; United States publisher: [[Bloomsbury USA]].) The book became an international bestseller, and has been published to date in more than thirty-five languages. It has received the praise of, among others, Nobel Laureate [[John Forbes Nash, Jr.|John Nash]], British mathematician [[Sir Michael Atiyah]], critic [[George Steiner]] and psychiatrist [[Oliver Sacks]]. ''Uncle Petros'' is one of the ''[[1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://1001beforeyoudie.com {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110124836/http://1001beforeyoudie.com/ |date=2014-01-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Doxiadis’ next project, which took over five years to complete, was the graphic novel ''[[Logicomix]]'' (2009), a number one bestseller on the [[New York Times Bestseller List]] and an international bestseller, already published in over twenty languages. ''Logicomix'' was co-authored with computer scientist [[Christos Papadimitriou]], with art work by [[Alecos Papadatos]] (pencils) and Annie Di Donna (color). Renowned comics historian and critic R. C. Harvey, in the ''[[Comics Journal]]'', called ''Logicomix'' “a tour-de-force” a “virtuoso performance”,&lt;ref&gt;http://classic.tcj.com/history/logicomix-a-tour-de-force/&lt;/ref&gt; while ''[[The Sunday Times]]''’ Brian Appleyard called it “probably the best and certainly the most extraordinary graphic novel” he has read. ''Logicomix'' is one of Paul Gravett’s ''1001 Comics You Must Read Before you Die.'' &lt;ref&gt;http://www.paulgravett.com/index.php/1001_comics/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theatre and cinema===
In the early stage of his career, Doxiadis directed in the professional theatre, in Athens, and worked as translator, translating, among other plays, [[William Shakespeare]]’s ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', ''[[Hamlet]]'' and ''[[Midsummer Night’s Dream]]'', as well as [[Eugene O’Neill]]’s ''[[Mourning Becomes Electra]]''.

He has written two plays for the theatre. The first was a full-length shadow-puppet play ''The Tragical History of Jackson Pollock, Abstract Expressionist'' (1999), in English, of which he also designed and directed the Athens performance.&lt;ref&gt;Watch a performance, filmed by Doxiadis: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJMyQ4Bkiow&lt;/ref&gt; In this play, Doxiadis realized some of his views on “epic theatre”, in other words a theatre based on storytelling.&lt;ref&gt;Read his own views on the matter in an interview: http://www.apostolosdoxiadis.com/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=158&amp;Itemid=94{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; His second play, ''Incompleteness'' (2005), is an imaginary account of the last seventeen days in the life of the great logician [[Kurt Gödel]], which Gödel spent in a Princeton, New Jersey, hospital, refusing to eat out of fear that he was being poisoned. The play was staged in Athens, in 2006, as Dekati Evdomi Nyhta (Seventeenth Night) with the actor Yorgos Kotanidis in the role of Kurt Gödel.

Doxiadis has also written and directed two feature-length films, in Greek, ''Underground Passage'' (''Υπόγεια Διαδρομή'', 1983) and ''Terirem'' (''Τεριρέμ'', 1987). The latter won the [[CICAE]] (International Confederation of Art Cinemas) prize for Best Film in the 1988 [[Berlin International Film Festival]].

===Scholarship===
Doxiadis has a lifelong interest in logic, cognitive psychology and rhetoric, as well as the theoretical study of narrative.&lt;ref&gt;Some of his published papers are reprinted here: {{cite web|url=http://www.apostolosdoxiadis.com/en/index.php?option%3Dcom_content%26view%3Darticle%26id%3D189%26Itemid%3D70 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105053729/http://www.apostolosdoxiadis.com/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=189&amp;Itemid=70 |archivedate=2012-01-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, he organized, with mathematician [[Barry Mazur]], a meeting on the theoretical investigation of the relationship of mathematics and narrative, whose proceedings were published as ''Circles Disturbed, The Interplay of Mathematics and Narrative'' (2012).&lt;ref&gt;http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9764.html&lt;/ref&gt; Doxiadis has lectured extensively on his theoretical interests.&lt;ref&gt;http://royalsociety.org/exhibitions/one-culture/apostolos-doxiadis/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mediasite.rhul.ac.uk/rhul/SilverlightPlayer/Default.aspx?peid%3D0422442741e14f90a3cc8a098b14ab051d |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110912161456/http://mediasite.rhul.ac.uk/rhul/SilverlightPlayer/Default.aspx?peid=0422442741e14f90a3cc8a098b14ab051d |archivedate=2011-09-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Doxiadis’ recent work has led him to formulate a theory about the development of deductive proof in Classical Greece, which lays emphasis on influences from pre-existing patterns in narrative and, especially, Archaic Age Poetry.&lt;ref&gt;An earlier draft of a write-up of some of these ideas can be found at https://www.academia.edu/3222520/A_Streetcar_Named_among_Other_Things_Proof&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honours==
''Uncle Petros and Goldbach’s Conjecture'' was the first recipient of the Premio Peano&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.subalpinamathesis.unito.it/attivita/premiopeano.php Associazione Subalpina Mathesis – Premio Peano] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119213218/http://www.subalpinamathesis.unito.it/attivita/premiopeano.php |date=November 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the first international award for books inspired by mathematics and short-listed for the [[Prix Médicis]]. ''Logicomix'' has earned numerous awards, among them the Bertrand Russell Society Award, the Royal Booksellers Association Award (the Netherlands), the New Atlantic Booksellers Award (USA), the Prix Tangente (France), the Premio Carlo Boscarato (Italy), the Comicdom Award (Greece). It was chosen as "Book of the Year" by ''[[TIME Magazine]]'', ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'', ''[[The Financial Times]]'', ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', and other publications.

In the [[history of mathematics|historical study of mathematics]], an '''apotome''' is a line segment formed from a longer line segment by breaking it into two parts, one of which is [[Commensurability (mathematics)|commensurable]] only in power to the whole; the other part is the apotome. In this definition, two line segments are said to be "commensurable only in power" when the ratio of their lengths is an [[irrational number]] but the ratio of their squared lengths is rational.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Translated into modern algebraic language, an apotome can be interpreted as a [[quadratic irrational]] number formed by subtracting one [[square root]] of a rational number from another.
This concept of the apotome appears in [[Euclid's Elements]] beginning in book X, where Euclid defines two special kinds of apotomes. In an apotome of the first kind, the whole is rational, while in an apotome of the second kind, the part subtracted from it is rational; both kinds of apotomes also satisfy an additional condition.  Euclid Proposition XIII.6 states that, if a rational line segment is split into two pieces in the [[golden ratio]], then both pieces may be represented as apotomes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookXIII/propXIII6.html Euclid Proposition XIII.6].&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Association for Women in Mathematics (AWM)''' is a professional society whose mission is to encourage women and girls to study and to have active careers in the mathematical sciences, and to promote equal opportunity for and the equal treatment of women and girls in the mathematical sciences. The AWM was founded in 1971 and incorporated in the state of Massachusetts.  AWM has approximately 5200 members, including over 250 institutional members, such as colleges, universities, institutes, and mathematical societies.  It offers numerous programs and workshops to mentor women and girls in the mathematical sciences.  Much of AWM’s work is supported through federal grants.

==History==
The Association was founded in 1971 as the Association of Women Mathematicians, but the name was changed almost immediately.  As reported in "A Brief History of the Association for Women in Mathematics: The Presidents' Perspectives", by [[Lenore Blum]], "As Judy Green remembers (and [[Chandler Davis]], early AWM friend, concurs): 'The formal idea of women getting together and forming a caucus was first made publicly at a MAG [Mathematics Action Group] meeting in 1971 ... in Atlantic City.  Joanne Darken, then an instructor at Temple University and now at the Community College of Philadelphia, stood up at the meeting and suggested that the women present remain and form a caucus.  I have been able to document six women who remained: me (I was a graduate student at Maryland at the time), Joanne Darken, Mary [W.] Gray (she was already at American University), Diane Laison (then an instructor at Temple), Gloria Olive (a Senior Lecturer at the University of Otago, New Zealand who was visiting the U.S. at the time) and [[Annie Selden]]... It's not absolutely clear what happened next, except that I've personally always thought that Mary was responsible for getting the whole thing organized ....'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awm-math.org/articles/notices/199107/blum/node2.html#SECTION02010000000000000000 |title=A Brief History of the Association for Women in Mathematics (from Notices): How it was |publisher=Awm-math.org |date= |accessdate=2015-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Mary W. Gray]] was the early organizer, placing an advertisement in the February 1971 Notices of the AMS, and writing the first issue of the ''AWM Newsletter'' that May.  Early goals of the association focused on equal pay for equal work, as well as equal consideration for admission to graduate school and support while there; for faculty appointments at all levels; for promotion and for tenure; for administrative appointments; and for government grants, positions on review and advisory panels and positions in professional organizations. The AWM holds an annual meeting at the [[Joint Mathematics Meetings]].  In 2011 the association initiated a biennial Research Symposium during its 40th anniversary celebration 40 Years and Counting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=40 Years and Counting: 2011 is AWM’s 40th Anniversary Year!|url=https://sites.google.com/site/awmmath/awm40events|website=Association for Women in Mathematics|publisher=Association for Women in Mathematics|accessdate=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lectures==
The AWM sponsors three honorary lecture series.&lt;ref name=AWMPrograms&gt;{{cite web |title=AWM Programs |url=https://sites.google.com/site/awmmath/programs |publisher=Association for Women in Mathematics |accessdate=21 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[Noether Lecture]]s – honor women who "have made fundamental and sustained contributions to the mathematical sciences". Presented in association with the [[American Mathematical Society]], the lecture is given at the annual [[Joint Mathematics Meetings]].
* The [[AWM/MAA Falconer Lecturer|Falconer Lectures]] – honor women who "have made distinguished contributions to the mathematical sciences or mathematics education. Presented in association with the [[Mathematical Association of America]], the lecture is given at the annual [[MathFest]].

      <comment>/* Application to densely ordered sets */ [[MOS:BOLD]]</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5353">In [[mathematical logic]], especially [[set theory]] and [[model theory]], the '''back-and-forth method''' is a method for showing [[isomorphism]] between [[countably infinite]] structures satisfying specified conditions. In particular:

* It can be used to prove that any two [[countably infinite]] [[dense order|densely ordered]] sets (i.e., linearly ordered in such a way that between any two members there is another) without endpoints are isomorphic. An isomorphism between [[linear order]]s is simply a strictly increasing [[bijection]]. This result implies, for example, that there exists a strictly increasing bijection between the set of all [[rational number]]s and the set of all [[real number|real]] [[algebraic number]]s.
* It can be used to prove that any two countably infinite atomless [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebras]] are isomorphic to each other.
* It can be used to prove that any two equivalent countable [[atomic model (mathematical logic)|atomic models]] of a theory are isomorphic.
* It can be used to prove that the [[Erdős–Rényi model]] of [[random graph]]s, when applied to countably infinite graphs, always produces a unique graph, the [[Rado graph]].
* It can be used to prove that any two [[m-complete]] [[recursively enumerable]] sets are [[computable function|recursively]] isomorphic.

== Application to densely ordered sets ==
Suppose that

* (''A'', ≤&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''B'', ≤&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt;) are linearly ordered sets;
* They are both unbounded, in other words neither ''A'' nor ''B'' has either a maximum or a minimum;
* They are densely ordered, i.e. between any two members there is another;
* They are countably infinite.

Fix enumerations (without repetition) of the underlying sets:

:''A'' = { ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, … },
:''B'' = { ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''b''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, … }.

Now we construct a one-to-one correspondence between ''A'' and ''B'' that is strictly increasing. Initially no member of ''A'' is paired with any member of ''B''.

: '''(1)''' Let ''i'' be the smallest index such that ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is not yet paired with any member of ''B''. Let ''j'' be some index such that ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; is not yet paired with any member of ''A'' '''and''' ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; can be paired with ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; consistently with the requirement that the pairing be strictly increasing. Pair ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; with ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;.

: '''(2)''' Let ''j'' be the smallest index such that ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; is not yet paired with any member of ''A''. Let ''i'' be some index such that ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is not yet paired with any member of ''B'' '''and''' ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; can be paired with ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; consistently with the requirement that the pairing be strictly increasing. Pair ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; with ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;.

: '''(3)''' Go back to step '''(1)'''.

It still has to be checked that the choice required in step '''(1)''' and '''(2)''' can actually be made in accordance to the requirements. Using step '''(1)''' as an example:

If there are already ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt; in ''A'' corresponding to ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt; in ''B'' respectively such that ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;, we choose ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; in between ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt; using density. Otherwise, we choose a suitable large or small element of ''B'' using the fact that ''B'' has neither a maximum nor a minimum. Choices made in step '''(2)''' are dually possible. Finally, the construction ends after countably many steps because ''A'' and ''B'' are countably infinite. Note that we had to use all the prerequisites.

== History ==
According to Hodges (1993):
:''Back-and-forth methods are often ascribed to [[Georg Cantor|Cantor]], [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Cooper Harold Langford|C. H. Langford]] […], but there is no evidence to support any of these attributions.''
While the theorem on countable densely ordered sets is due to Cantor (1895), the back-and-forth method with which it is now proved was developed by Huntington (1904) and Hausdorff (1914). Later it was applied in other situations, most notably by [[Roland Fraïssé]] in [[model theory]].

[[File:SHARP ELSIMATE EL-W221.jpg|thumb|upright|An electronic pocket calculator with a [[liquid-crystal display]] (LCD) [[seven-segment display]] that can perform arithmetic operations]]
[[File:Casio-fx115ES-5564.jpg|thumb|upright|A modern scientific calculator with a [[dot matrix]] LCD]]
An '''electronic calculator''' is typically a portable [[Electronics|electronic]] device used to perform [[calculation]]s, ranging from basic [[arithmetic]] to complex [[mathematics]].

The first [[Solid-state electronics|solid-state electronic]] calculator was created in the early 1960s. Pocket-sized devices became available in the 1970s, especially after the [[Intel 4004]], the first [[microprocessor]], was developed by [[Intel]] for the Japanese calculator company [[Busicom]]. They later became used commonly within the [[petroleum industry]] (oil and gas).

Modern electronic calculators vary from cheap, give-away, [[ISO/IEC 7810|credit-card-sized]] models to sturdy desktop models with built-in printers. They became popular in the mid-1970s as the incorporation of [[integrated circuit]]s reduced their size and cost. By the end of that decade, prices had dropped to the point where a basic calculator was affordable to most and they became common in schools.

Computer [[operating system]]s as far back as [[Ancient UNIX|early Unix]] have included interactive calculator [[Computer program|programs]] such as [[dc (computer program)|dc]] and [[hoc (programming language)|hoc]], and calculator functions are included in almost all [[personal digital assistant]] (PDA) type devices, the exceptions being a few dedicated address book and dictionary devices.

In addition to general purpose calculators, there are those designed for specific markets. For example, there are [[scientific calculator]]s which include [[trigonometry|trigonometric]] and [[statistics|statistical]] calculations. Some calculators even have the ability to do [[computer algebra]]. [[Graphing calculator]]s can be used to graph functions defined on the real line, or higher-dimensional [[Euclidean space]]. {{As of|2016}}, basic calculators cost little, but scientific and graphing models tend to cost more.

In 1986, calculators still represented an estimated 41% of the world's general-purpose hardware capacity to compute information. By 2007, this diminished to less than 0.05%.&lt;ref name="HilbertLopez2011"&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/332/6025/60 "The World’s Technological Capacity to Store, Communicate, and Compute Information"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130727161911/http://www.sciencemag.org/content/332/6025/60 |date=2013-07-27 }}, Martin Hilbert and Priscila López (2011), [[Science (journal)|Science]], 332(6025), 60–65; see also [http://www.martinhilbert.net/WorldInfoCapacity.html "free access to the study"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414233810/http://www.martinhilbert.net/WorldInfoCapacity.html/ |date=2016-04-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
[[File:CalculatorFractions-5550x.jpg|thumb|Scientific calculator displays of fractions and decimal equivalents]]

===Input===
[[Electronics|Electronic]] calculators contain a [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]] with [[Push-button|buttons]] for [[Numerical digit|digit]]s and [[arithmetic]]al operations; some even contain "00" and "000" buttons to make larger or smaller [[number]]s easier to enter. Most basic calculators assign only one digit or operation on each button; however, in more specific calculators, a button can perform multi-function working with [[key combination]]s.

===Display output===
Calculators usually have [[liquid-crystal display]]s (LCD) as output in place of historical [[light-emitting diode]] (LED) displays and [[vacuum fluorescent display]]s (VFD); details are provided in the section ''[[#Technical improvements|Technical improvements]]''.

Large-sized [[Number|figures]] are often used to improve readability; while using [[decimal separator]] (usually a point rather than a [[comma]]) instead of or in addition to [[vulgar fraction]]s. Various symbols for [[Command (computing)|function commands]] may also be shown on the display. [[Fraction (mathematics)|Fractions]] such as {{math|{{frac|1|3}}}} are displayed as decimal [[approximation]]s, for example rounded to {{math|0.33333333}}. Also, some fractions (such as {{math|{{frac|1|7}}}}, which is {{math|0.14285714285714}}; to 14 [[significant figures]]) can be difficult to recognize in [[decimal]] form; as a result, many [[Scientific calculator|scientific]] calculators are able to work in vulgar fractions or [[mixed number]]s.

===Memory===
Calculators also have the ability to store numbers into [[computer memory]]. Basic calculators usually store only one number at a time; more specific types are able to store many numbers represented in [[variable (mathematics)|variable]]s. The variables can also be used for constructing [[formula]]s. Some models have the ability to extend [[Computer memory|memory]] capacity to store more numbers; the extended [[memory address]] is termed an [[array data structure|array]] index.

===Power source===
Power sources of calculators are: [[electric battery|batteries]], [[Amorphous silicon#Solar cells|solar cells]] or [[mains electricity]] (for old models), turning on with a [[switch]] or button. Some models even have no turn-off button but they provide some way to put off (for example, leaving no operation for a moment, covering [[solar cell]] exposure, or closing their [[lid]]). [[Crank (mechanism)|Crank]]-powered calculators were also common in the early computer era.

===Key layout===
The following keys are common to most pocket calculators.  While the arrangement of the digits is standard, the positions of other keys vary from model to model; the illustration is an example.

==Internal workings==
In general, a basic [[Electronics|electronic]] calculator consists of the following components:&lt;ref&gt;John Lewis, ''The Pocket Calculator Book''. (London: Usborne, 1982)&lt;/ref&gt;

* Power source ([[mains electricity]], [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] and/or [[Amorphous silicon#Solar cells|solar cell]])
* [[Keypad]] (input device) – consists of keys used to input numbers and function commands ([[addition]], [[multiplication]], [[Square root|square-root]], etc.)
* Display panel (output device) – displays input numbers, commands and results. [[Liquid-crystal display]]s (LCDs), [[vacuum fluorescent display]]s (VFDs), and [[light-emitting diode]] (LED) displays use [[Seven-segment display|seven segments]] to represent each [[Numerical digit|digit]] in a basic calculator. Advanced calculators may use [[dot matrix]] displays.
** A printing calculator, in addition to a display panel, has a printing unit that prints results in ink onto a roll of paper, using a printing mechanism.
* Processor [[Chipset|chip]] ([[microprocessor]] or [[central processing unit]]).

[[Clock rate]] of a processor [[Chipset|chip]] refers to the frequency at which the [[central processing unit]] (CPU) is running. It is used as an indicator of the processor's speed, and is measured in ''clock cycles per second'' or the [[International System of Units|SI]] unit [[Hertz|hertz (Hz)]]. For basic calculators, the speed can vary from a few hundred [[hertz]] to the [[kilohertz]] range.

===Example===
A basic explanation as to how calculations are performed in a simple four-function calculator:

To perform the calculation {{nowrap|25 + 9}}, one presses keys in the following sequence on most calculators: {{key press|2}}&amp;nbsp;{{key press|5}}&amp;nbsp;{{key press|+}}&amp;nbsp;{{key press|9}}&amp;nbsp;{{key press|{{=}}}}.

:* When {{key press|2}}&amp;nbsp;{{key press|5}} is entered, it is picked up by the scanning unit; the number 25 is encoded and sent to the X register;
:* Next, when the {{key press|+}} key is pressed, the "[[addition]]" instruction is also encoded and sent to the flag or [[status register]];
:* The second number {{Key press|9}} is encoded and sent to the X register. This "pushes" (shifts) the first number out into the Y register;
:* When the {{key press|{{=}}}} key is pressed, a "message" (signal) from the flag or [[status register]] tells the permanent or [[non-volatile memory]] that the operation to be done is "[[addition]]";
:* The numbers in the X and Y registers are then loaded into the [[Arithmetic logic unit|ALU]] and the calculation is carried out following instructions from the permanent or non-volatile memory;
:* The answer, 34 is sent (shifted) back to the X register. From there, it is converted by the [[binary decoder]] unit into a decimal number (usually [[binary-coded decimal]]), and then shown on the display panel.

Other functions are usually performed using repeated additions or subtractions.

====Numeric representation====
{{Main|Binary-coded decimal}}

Most pocket calculators do all their calculations in BCD rather than a [[floating-point representation]].  BCD is common in electronic systems where a numeric value is to be displayed, especially in systems consisting solely of digital logic, and not containing a microprocessor. By employing BCD, the manipulation of numerical data for display can be greatly simplified by treating each digit as a separate single sub-circuit. This matches much more closely the physical reality of display hardware—a designer might choose to use a series of separate identical [[seven-segment display]]s to build a metering circuit, for example. If the numeric quantity were stored and manipulated as pure binary, interfacing to such a display would require complex circuitry. Therefore, in cases where the calculations are relatively simple, working throughout with BCD can lead to a simpler overall system than converting to and from binary.

The same argument applies when hardware of this type uses an embedded microcontroller or other small processor. Often, smaller code results when representing numbers internally in BCD format, since a conversion from or to binary representation can be expensive on such limited processors. For these applications, some small processors feature BCD arithmetic modes, which assist when writing routines that manipulate BCD quantities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=University of Alicante |title=A Cordic-based Architecture for High Performance Decimal Calculations |url=http://rua.ua.es/dspace/bitstream/10045/11826/1/VF-016519.pdf |publisher=[[IEEE]] |access-date=2015-08-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303235832/http://rua.ua.es/dspace/bitstream/10045/11826/1/VF-016519.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Decimal CORDIC Rotation based on Selection by Rounding: Algorithm and Architecture |url=http://faculties.sbu.ac.ir/~jaberipur/Papers/Journals/19.pdf |publisher=[[British Computer Society]] |access-date=2015-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Where calculators have added functions (such as square root, or [[trigonometric functions]]), software [[algorithm]]s are required to produce high precision results. Sometimes significant design effort is needed to fit all the desired functions in the limited memory space available in the calculator [[Chipset|chip]], with acceptable calculation time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hpl.hp.com/hpjournal/72jun/jun72a2.pdf |title=David S.

==Calculators compared to computers==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2009}}
The fundamental difference between a calculator and [[computer]] is that a computer can be [[Computer programming|programmed]] in a way that allows the [[Computer program|program]] to take different [[Branch on condition|branches according to intermediate results]], while calculators are pre-designed with specific functions (such as [[addition]], [[multiplication]], and [[logarithm]]s) built in. The distinction is not clear-cut: some devices classed as [[programmable calculator]]s have [[Computer programming|programming]] functions, sometimes with support for [[programming language]]s (such as [[RPL (programming language)|RPL]] or [[TI-BASIC]]).

For instance, instead of a hardware multiplier, a calculator might implement [[floating point]] mathematics with code in [[read-only memory]] (ROM), and compute [[trigonometric function]]s with the [[CORDIC]] algorithm because CORDIC does not require much multiplication. [[Serial communication|Bit serial]] logic designs are more common in calculators whereas [[Parallel communication|bit parallel]] designs dominate general-purpose computers, because a bit serial design minimizes [[chipset|chip]] complexity, but takes many more [[clock signal|clock cycles]]. This distinction blurs with high-end calculators, which use processor chips associated with computer and embedded systems design, more so the [[Zilog Z80|Z80]], [[Motorola 68000|MC68000]], and [[ARM architecture|ARM]] architectures, and some custom designs specialized for the calculator market.

==History==

===Precursors to the electronic calculator===
{{Main|Mechanical calculator}}
{{See also|Human computer}}

The first known tools used to aid arithmetic calculations were: bones (used to tally items), pebbles, and [[counting board]]s, and the [[abacus]], known to have been used by [[Sumer]]ians and [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] before 2000&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Ifrah|2001|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Except for the [[Antikythera mechanism]] (an "out of the time" [[Astronomy|astronomical]] device), development of computing tools arrived near the start of the 17th century: the [[Sector (instrument)|geometric-military compass]] (by [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]]), [[logarithm]]s and [[Napier bones]] (by [[John Napier|Napier]]), and the [[slide rule]] (by [[Edmund Gunter]]).

In 1642, the [[Renaissance]] saw the invention of the [[mechanical calculator]] (by [[Wilhelm Schickard]]&lt;ref&gt;See for example, http://calculatorhistory.net&lt;/ref&gt; and several decades later [[Blaise Pascal]]&lt;ref&gt;Pascal's invention of the [[calculating machine]]. Pascal invented his machine just four hundred years ago, as a youth of nineteen. He was spurred to it by sharing the burden of arithmetical labor involved in his father's official work as supervisor of taxes at Rouen. He conceived the idea of doing the work mechanically, and developed a design appropriate for this purpose ; showing herein the same combination of pure science and mechanical genius that characterized his whole life. But it was one thing to conceive and design the machine, and another to get it made and put into use. Here were needed those practical gifts that he displayed later in his inventions....&lt;br&gt;
In a sense, Pascal's invention was premature, in that the mechanical arts in his time were not sufficiently advanced to enable his machine to be made at an economic price, with the accuracy and strength needed for reasonably long use. This difficulty was not overcome until well on into the nineteenth century, by which time also a renewed stimulus to invention was given by the need for many kinds of calculation more intricate than those considered by Pascal. [[#NAT CHAP|S. Chapman, Magazine Nature]], pp.508,509 (1942)&lt;/ref&gt;), a device that was at times somewhat over-promoted as being able to perform all four [[arithmetic]] operations with minimal human intervention.&lt;ref&gt;"Pascal and Leibnitz, in the seventeenth century, and Diderot at a later period, endeavored to construct a machine which might serve as a substitute for human intelligence in the combination of figures" [https://books.google.com/books?id=Rf0IAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA100&amp;dq=arithmometer&amp;as_brr=1#v=onepage&amp;q=arithmometer The Gentleman's magazine, Volume 202, p.100] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171106145057/https://books.google.com/books?id=Rf0IAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA100&amp;dq=arithmometer&amp;as_brr=1 |date=2017-11-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pascal's calculator]] could add and subtract two numbers directly and thus, if the tedium could be borne, multiply and divide by repetition. Schickard's machine, constructed several decades earlier, used a clever set of mechanised multiplication tables to ease the process of multiplication and division with the adding machine as a means of completing this operation. (Because they were different inventions with different aims a debate about whether Pascal or Schickard should be credited as the "inventor" of the adding machine (or calculating machine) is probably pointless.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://metastudies.net/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Site.SchicardvsPascal Pascal vs Schickard: An empty debate?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408215848/http://metastudies.net/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Site.SchicardvsPascal |date=2014-04-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) Schickard and Pascal were followed by [[Gottfried Leibniz]] who spent forty years designing a four-operation mechanical calculator, the [[stepped reckoner]], inventing in the process his [[leibniz wheel]], but who couldn't design a fully operational machine.&lt;ref&gt;In 1893, the German calculating machine inventor Arthur Burkhardt was asked to put Leibniz machine in operating condition if possible. His report was favorable except for the sequence in the carry {{cite book|last=Ginsburg|first=Jekuthiel|title=Scripta Mathematica|year=1933|publisher=Kessinger Publishing, LLC|isbn=978-0-7661-3835-3|page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were also five unsuccessful attempts to design a calculating clock in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;see [[Mechanical calculator#Calculating clocks: unsuccessful mechanical calculators]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 18th century saw the arrival of some notable improvements, first by [[Giovanni Poleni|Poleni]] with the first fully functional calculating clock and four-operation machine, but these machines were almost always ''one of the kind''. [[Luigi Torchi (inventor)|Luigi Torchi]] invented the first direct multiplication machine in 1834: this was also the second key-driven machine in the world, following that of James White (1822).&lt;ref&gt;Denis Roegel: [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?reload=true&amp;arnumber=7763737 ''Before Torchi and Schwilgué, There Was White.''] In: ''IEEE Annals of the History of Computing,'' October–December 2016, pp. 92-93. Retrieved 2018-05-06.&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the 19th century and the [[Industrial Revolution]] that real developments began to occur. Although machines capable of performing all four arithmetic functions existed prior to the 19th century, the refinement of manufacturing and fabrication processes during the eve of the industrial revolution made large scale production of more compact and modern units possible. The [[Arithmometer]], invented in 1820 as a four-operation mechanical calculator, was released to production in 1851 as an adding machine and became the first commercially successful unit; forty years later, by 1890, about 2,500 arithmometers had been sold&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arithmometre.org/NumerosSerie/PageNumerosSeriePayen.html |title=(retrieved on 01/02/2012) |language=fr |publisher=Arithmometre.org |date= |access-date=2013-10-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521075617/http://www.arithmometre.org/NumerosSerie/PageNumerosSeriePayen.html |archivedate=2013-05-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; plus a few hundreds more from two arithmometer clone makers (Burkhardt, Germany, 1878 and Layton, UK, 1883) and Felt and Tarrant, the only other competitor in true commercial production, had sold 100 [[comptometer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Felt|first=Dorr E.|title=Mechanical arithmetic, or The history of the counting machine|publisher=Washington Institute|location=Chicago|page=4|year=1916|url=https://archive.org/details/mechanicalarithm00feltrich|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160703013921/https://archive.org/details/mechanicalarithm00feltrich|archivedate=2016-07-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It wasn't until 1902 that the familiar push-button user interface was developed, with the introduction of the Dalton Adding Machine, developed by James L. Dalton in the [[United States]].

In 1921, [[Edith Clarke]] invented the "Clarke calculator", a simple graph-based calculator for solving line equations involving hyperbolic functions. This allowed electrical engineers to simplify calculations for [[inductance]] and [[capacitance]] in [[power transmission lines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lott|first1=Melissa C.|title=The Engineer Who Foreshadowed the Smart Grid--in 1921|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/plugged-in/the-engineer-who-foreshadowed-the-smart-grid-in-1921/|website=Plugged In|publisher=Scientific American Blog Network|accessdate=14 August 2017|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170814232626/https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/plugged-in/the-engineer-who-foreshadowed-the-smart-grid-in-1921/|archivedate=14 August 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Curta]] calculator was developed in 1948 and, although costly, became popular for its portability. This purely mechanical hand-held device could do addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. By the early 1970s electronic pocket calculators ended manufacture of mechanical calculators, although the Curta remains a popular collectable item.

===Development of electronic calculators===
The first [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] computers, using firstly [[vacuum tube]]s and later [[transistor]]s in the logic circuits, appeared in the 1940s and 1950s. This technology was to provide a stepping stone to the development of electronic calculators.

The [[Casio]] Computer Company, in [[Japan]], released the Model ''14-A'' calculator in 1957, which was the world's first all-electric (relatively) compact calculator. It did not use electronic logic but was based on [[relay]] technology, and was built into a desk.

In October 1961, the world's first ''all-electronic desktop'' calculator, the British [[Bell Punch]]/Sumlock Comptometer [[Sumlock ANITA calculator|ANITA]] ('''A''' '''N'''ew '''I'''nspiration '''T'''o '''A'''rithmetic/'''A'''ccounting) was announced.&lt;ref&gt;"Simple and Silent", ''Office Magazine'', December 1961, p1244&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"'Anita' der erste tragbare elektonische Rechenautomat" [trans: "the first portable electronic computer"], ''Büromaschinen Mechaniker'', November 1961, p207&lt;/ref&gt; This machine used [[vacuum tube]]s, cold-cathode tubes and [[Dekatron]]s in its circuits, with 12 cold-cathode [[Nixie tube|"Nixie"]] tubes for its display. Two models were displayed, the Mk VII for continental Europe and the Mk VIII for Britain and the rest of the world, both for delivery from early 1962. The Mk VII was a slightly earlier design with a more complicated mode of multiplication, and was soon dropped in favour of the simpler Mark VIII. The ANITA had a full keyboard, similar to mechanical [[comptometer]]s of the time, a feature that was unique to it and the later [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp]] CS-10A among electronic calculators. The ANITA weighed roughly {{convert|33|lb|kg}} due to its large tube system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ball|first1=Guy|last2=Flamm|first2=Bruce|title=The History of Pocket Electronic Calculators|url=http://www.vintagecalculators.com/html/history_of_electronic_calculat.html|website=vintagecalculators.com|publisher=[[Vintage Calculators Web Museum]]|access-date=8 July 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703140814/http://vintagecalculators.com/html/history_of_electronic_calculat.html|archivedate=3 July 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bell Punch had been producing key-driven mechanical calculators of the comptometer type under the names "Plus" and "Sumlock", and had realised in the mid-1950s that the future of calculators lay in electronics. They employed the young graduate Norbert Kitz, who had worked on the early British [[Pilot ACE]] computer project, to lead the development. The ANITA sold well since it was the only electronic desktop calculator available, and was silent and quick.

The tube technology of the ANITA was superseded in June 1963 by the U.S. manufactured [[Friden, Inc.|Friden]] EC-130, which had an all-transistor design, a stack of four 13-digit numbers displayed on a {{convert|5|in|cm|adj=on}} [[cathode ray tube]] (CRT), and introduced [[Reverse Polish Notation]] (RPN) to the calculator market for a price of $2200, which was about three times the cost of an electromechanical calculator of the time. Like Bell Punch, Friden was a manufacturer of mechanical calculators that had decided that the future lay in electronics. In 1964 more all-transistor electronic calculators were introduced: [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp]] introduced the [[CS-10A]], which weighed {{convert|25|kg|lb}} and cost 500,000 yen (${{To USD|500000|JPN}}), and [[Industria Macchine Elettroniche]] of Italy introduced the IME 84, to which several extra keyboard and display units could be connected so that several people could make use of it (but apparently not at the same time).

[[File:Olivetti Programma 101 - Museo scienza e tecnologia Milano.jpg|thumb|The Italian [[Programma 101]], the first commercial programmable desktop computer, produced by [[Olivetti]] in 1964]]

There followed a series of electronic calculator models from these and other manufacturers, including [[Canon Inc.|Canon]], [[Mathatronics]], [[Olivetti]], [[SCM Corporation|SCM]] (Smith-Corona-Marchant), [[Sony]], [[Toshiba]], and [[Wang Laboratories|Wang]]. The early calculators used hundreds of [[Bipolar junction transistor#Germanium transistors|germanium transistors]], which were cheaper than [[Transistor#Semiconductor material|silicon transistor]]s, on multiple circuit boards. Display types used were [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]], cold-cathode [[Nixie tube]]s, and [[filament lamp]]s. Memory technology was usually based on the [[delay line memory]] or the [[magnetic core memory]], though the Toshiba "Toscal" BC-1411 appears to have used an early form of [[dynamic RAM]] built from discrete components. Already there was a desire for smaller and less power-hungry machines.

The [[Olivetti]] [[Programma 101]] was introduced in late 1965; it was a stored program machine which could read and write magnetic cards and displayed results on its built-in printer. Memory, implemented by an acoustic delay line, could be partitioned between program steps, constants, and data registers. Programming allowed conditional testing and programs could also be overlaid by reading from magnetic cards. It is regarded as the first personal computer produced by a company (that is, a desktop '''electronic calculating machine''' programmable by non-specialists for personal use). The Olivetti Programma 101 won many industrial design awards.

The ''[[Monroe Epic]]'' programmable calculator came on the market in 1967. A large, printing, desk-top unit, with an attached floor-standing logic tower, it could be programmed to perform many computer-like functions. However, the only ''branch'' instruction was an implied unconditional branch (GOTO) at the end of the operation stack, returning the program to its starting instruction. Thus, it was not possible to include any [[conditional branch]] (IF-THEN-ELSE) logic. During this era, the absence of the conditional branch was sometimes used to distinguish a programmable calculator from a computer.

===1970s to mid-1980s===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Casio as-a ckt1 1c.jpg|thumb|Internal circuit with twelve Nixie tube display elements inside a 1960s desktop calculator]] --&gt;
The electronic calculators of the mid-1960s were large and heavy desktop machines due to their use of hundreds of [[transistor]]s on several circuit boards with a large power consumption that required an AC power supply. There were great efforts to put the logic required for a calculator into fewer and fewer [[integrated circuit]]s (chips) and calculator electronics was one of the leading edges of [[semiconductor]] development. U.S. semiconductor manufacturers led the world in [[Integrated circuit#SSI, MSI and LSI|large scale integration]] (LSI) semiconductor development, squeezing more and more functions into individual integrated circuits. This led to alliances between Japanese calculator manufacturers and U.S. semiconductor companies: [[Canon (company)|Canon Inc.]] with [[Texas Instruments]], [[Hayakawa Electric]] (later renamed [[Sharp Corporation]]) with North-American Rockwell Microelectronics (later renamed [[Rockwell International]]), [[Busicom]] with [[Mostek]] and [[Intel]], and [[General Instrument]] with [[Sanyo]].

====Pocket calculators====
{{Redirect|Pocket calculator|the song|Computer World}}

By 1970, a calculator could be made using just a few chips of low power consumption, allowing portable models powered from rechargeable batteries. The first portable calculators appeared in Japan in 1970, and were soon marketed around the world. These included the [[Sanyo]] ICC-0081 "Mini Calculator", the [[Canon (company)|Canon]] Pocketronic, and the [[Sharp QT-8B]] "micro Compet". The Canon Pocketronic was a development of the "Cal-Tech" project which had been started at [[Texas Instruments]] in 1965 as a research project to produce a portable calculator. The Pocketronic has no traditional display; numerical output is on thermal paper tape. As a result of the "Cal-Tech" project, Texas Instruments was granted master patents on portable calculators.

Sharp put in great efforts in size and power reduction and introduced in January 1971 the [[Sharp EL-8]], also marketed as the Facit 1111, which was close to being a pocket calculator. It weighed 1.59 pounds (721 grams), had a vacuum fluorescent display, rechargeable [[NiCad]] batteries, and initially sold for US $395.

However, the efforts in [[integrated circuit development]] culminated in the introduction in early 1971 of the first "calculator on a chip", the MK6010 by [[Mostek]],&lt;ref&gt;"Single Chip Calculator Hits the Finish Line", ''Electronics'', February 1, 1971, p19&lt;/ref&gt; followed by Texas Instruments later in the year. Although these early hand-held calculators were very costly, these advances in electronics, together with developments in display technology (such as the [[vacuum fluorescent display]], [[Light-emitting diode|LED]], and [[Liquid-crystal display|LCD]]), led within a few years to the cheap pocket calculator available to all.

In 1971 [[Pico Electronics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spingal.plus.com/micro |title=Microprocessor History |publisher=Spingal.plus.com |date= |access-date=2011-07-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720142104/http://www.spingal.plus.com/micro/ |archivedate=2011-07-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[General Instrument]] also introduced their first collaboration in ICs, a full single chip calculator IC for the Monroe Royal Digital III calculator. Pico was a spinout by five GI design engineers whose vision was to create single chip calculator ICs. Pico and GI went on to have significant success in the burgeoning handheld calculator market.

The first truly pocket-sized electronic calculator was the [[Busicom]] LE-120A "HANDY", which was marketed early in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;"The one-chip calculator is here, and it's only the beginning", Electronic Design, February 18, 1971, p34.&lt;/ref&gt; Made in Japan, this was also the first calculator to use an LED display, the first hand-held calculator to use a single integrated circuit (then proclaimed as a "calculator on a chip"), the [[Mostek]] MK6010, and the first electronic calculator to run off replaceable batteries.

The first American-made pocket-sized calculator, the Bowmar 901B (popularly termed ''The Bowmar Brain''), measuring {{convert|5.2 x 3.0 x 1.5|in|mm}}, came out in the Autumn of 1971, with four functions and an eight-digit red [[light-emitting diode|LED]] display, for $240, while in August 1972 the four-function [[Sinclair Executive]] became the first slimline pocket calculator measuring {{convert|5.4 x 2.2 x 0.35|in|mm}} and weighing {{convert|2.5|oz|g}}. It retailed for around £79 (${{To USD|79|GBR}}). By the end of the decade, similar calculators were priced less than £5 (${{To USD|5|GBR}}).

The first [[Soviet Union]] made pocket-sized calculator, the ''Elektronika B3-04'' was developed by the end of 1973 and sold at the start of 1974.

One of the first low-cost calculators was the [[Sinclair Cambridge]], launched in August 1973. It retailed for £29.95 (${{To USD|29.95|GBR}}), or £5 (${{To USD|5|GBR}}) less in kit form. The Sinclair calculators were successful because they were far cheaper than the competition; however, their design led to slow and inaccurate computations of [[transcendental function]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://righto.com/sinclair Reversing Sinclair's amazing 1974 calculator hack – half the ROM of the HP-35], Ken Shirriff, 2013.

Meanwhile, [[Hewlett-Packard]] (HP) had been developing a pocket calculator. Launched in early 1972, it was unlike the other basic four-function pocket calculators then available in that it was the first pocket calculator with ''scientific'' functions that could replace a [[slide rule]]. The $395 [[HP-35]], along with nearly all later HP engineering calculators, used [[reverse Polish notation]] (RPN), also called postfix notation. A calculation like "8 plus 5" is, using RPN, performed by pressing {{key top|8}}, {{key top|Enter↑}}, {{key top|5}}, and {{key top|+}}; instead of the algebraic [[infix notation]]: {{key top|8}}, {{key top|+}}, {{key top|5}}, {{key top|{{=}}}}. It had 35 buttons and was based on Mostek Mk6020 chip.

The first Soviet ''scientific'' pocket-sized calculator the "B3-18" was completed by the end of 1975.

In 1973, [[Texas Instruments]] (TI) introduced the [[TI SR-10|SR-10]], (''SR'' signifying [[slide rule]]) an ''algebraic entry'' pocket calculator using [[scientific notation]] for $150. Shortly after the [[TI SR-11|SR-11]] featured an added key for entering [[Pi]] (π). It was followed the next year by the [[TI SR-50|SR-50]] which added log and trig functions to compete with the HP-35, and in 1977 the mass-marketed [[TI-30]] line which is still produced.

In 1978 a new company, [[Calculated Industries]] arose which focused on specialized markets. Their first calculator, the Loan Arranger&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mathcs.albion.edu/~mbollman/CI/loanarranger2.htm |title=The Loan Arranger II |publisher=Mathcs.albion.edu |access-date=2011-07-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719134735/http://mathcs.albion.edu/~mbollman/CI/loanarranger2.htm |archivedate=2011-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (1978) was a pocket calculator marketed to the Real Estate industry with preprogrammed functions to simplify the process of calculating payments and future values. In 1985, CI launched a calculator for the construction industry called the Construction Master&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mathcs.albion.edu/~mbollman/CI/CM.htm |title=Construction Master |publisher=Mathcs.albion.edu |access-date=2011-07-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719135006/http://mathcs.albion.edu/~mbollman/CI/CM.htm |archivedate=2011-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which came preprogrammed with common construction calculations (such as angles, stairs, roofing math, pitch, rise, run, and feet-inch fraction conversions). This would be the first in a line of construction related calculators.

====Programmable calculators====
{{Main|Programmable calculator}}
[[File:HP 65.jpg|thumb|The [[HP-65]], the first programmable pocket calculator (1974)]]
The first desktop ''programmable calculators'' were produced in the mid-1960s by [[Mathatronics]] and [[Casio]] (AL-1000). These machines were very heavy and costly. The first programmable pocket calculator was the [[HP-65]], in 1974; it had a capacity of 100 instructions, and could store and retrieve programs with a built-in magnetic card reader. Two years later the [[HP-25C]] introduced ''[[continuous memory]]'', i.e., programs and data were retained in [[CMOS]] memory during power-off. In 1979, HP released the first ''[[alphanumeric]]'', programmable, ''expandable'' calculator, the [[HP-41]]C. It could be expanded with [[random access memory]] (RAM, for memory) and [[read-only memory]] (ROM, for software) modules, and peripherals like [[bar code]] readers, [[microcassette]] and [[floppy disk]] drives, paper-roll [[thermal printer]]s, and miscellaneous communication interfaces ([[RS-232]], [[HP-IL]], [[HP-IB]]).

The first Soviet programmable desktop calculator [[ISKRA 123]], powered by the power grid, was released at the start of the 1970s. The first Soviet pocket battery-powered programmable calculator, [[Elektronika]] ''[[B3-21]]'', was developed by the end of 1976 and released at the start of 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://electronika-5.ru/calc/doc/B3-21_pas.rar |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-12-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171231051719/http://electronika-5.ru/calc/doc/B3-21_pas.rar |archive-date=2017-12-31 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The successor of B3-21, the [[Elektronika B3-34]] wasn't backward compatible with B3-21, even if it kept the [[reverse Polish notation]] (RPN). Thus B3-34 defined a new command set, which later was used in a series of later programmable Soviet calculators. Despite very limited abilities (98 bytes of instruction memory and about 19 stack and addressable registers), people managed to write all kinds of programs for them, including [[adventure game]]s and libraries of calculus-related functions for engineers. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of programs were written for these machines, from practical scientific and business software, which were used in real-life offices and labs, to fun games for children. The [[Elektronika MK-52]] calculator (using the extended B3-34 command set, and featuring internal [[EEPROM]] memory for storing programs and external interface for EEPROM cards and other periphery) was used in Soviet spacecraft program (for [[Soyuz TM-7]] flight) as a backup of the board computer.

This series of calculators was also noted for a large number of highly counter-intuitive mysterious undocumented features, somewhat similar to "[[synthetic programming]]" of the American [[HP-41]], which were exploited by applying normal arithmetic operations to error messages, jumping to nonexistent addresses and other methods. A number of respected monthly publications, including the popular science magazine ''[[Nauka i Zhizn]]'' (''Наука и жизнь'', ''Science and Life''), featured special columns, dedicated to optimization methods for calculator programmers and updates on undocumented features for hackers, which grew into a whole esoteric science with many branches, named "[[yeggogology]]" ("еггогология"). The error messages on those calculators appear as a Russian word "YEGGOG" ("ЕГГОГ") which, unsurprisingly, is translated to "Error".

A similar hacker culture in the USA revolved around the [[HP-41]], which was also noted for a large number of undocumented features and was much more powerful than [[B3-34]].

====Technical improvements====
[[File:Solar-calculator.jpg|thumb|A calculator which runs on solar and battery power]]
Through the 1970s the hand-held electronic calculator underwent rapid development. The red LED and blue/green [[vacuum fluorescent display]]s consumed a lot of power and the calculators either had a short battery life (often measured in hours, so rechargeable [[nickel-cadmium battery|nickel-cadmium batteries]] were common) or were large so that they could take larger, higher capacity batteries. In the early 1970s [[liquid-crystal display]]s (LCDs) were in their infancy and there was a great deal of concern that they only had a short operating lifetime. Busicom introduced the Busicom ''LE-120A "HANDY"'' calculator, the first pocket-sized calculator and the first with an [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] display, and announced the Busicom ''LC'' with LCD. However, there were problems with this display and the calculator never went on sale. The first successful calculators with LCDs were manufactured by [[Rockwell International]] and sold from 1972 by other companies under such names as: Dataking ''LC-800'', Harden ''DT/12'', Ibico ''086'', Lloyds ''40'', Lloyds ''100'', Prismatic ''500'' (a.k.a. ''P500''), Rapid Data ''Rapidman 1208LC''. The LCDs were an early form using the ''Dynamic Scattering Mode DSM'' with the numbers appearing as bright against a dark background. To present a high-contrast display these models illuminated the LCD using a filament lamp and solid plastic light guide, which negated the low power consumption of the display. These models appear to have been sold only for a year or two.

A more successful series of calculators using a reflective DSM-LCD was launched in 1972 by [[Sharp Inc]] with the Sharp ''EL-805'', which was a slim pocket calculator. This, and another few similar models, used Sharp's ''Calculator On Substrate'' (COS) technology. An extension of one glass plate needed for the liquid crystal display was used as a substrate to mount the needed chips based on a new hybrid technology. The COS technology may have been too costly since it was only used in a few models before Sharp reverted to conventional circuit boards.

[[File:Braun 4856 solar card calculator, 2.jpg|thumb|Credit-card-sized, solar-powered calculator by [[Braun (company)|Braun]] (1987)]]
In the mid-1970s the first calculators appeared with field-effect, ''twisted nematic'' (TN) LCDs with dark numerals against a grey background, though the early ones often had a yellow filter over them to cut out damaging [[ultraviolet]] rays. The advantage of LCDs is that they are passive light modulators reflecting light, which require much less power than light-emitting displays such as LEDs or VFDs. This led the way to the first credit-card-sized calculators, such as the [[Casio]] ''Mini Card LC-78'' of 1978, which could run for months of normal use on button cells.

There were also improvements to the electronics inside the calculators. All of the logic functions of a calculator had been squeezed into the first "calculator on a chip" [[integrated circuit]]s (ICs) in 1971, but this was leading edge technology of the time and yields were low and costs were high. Many calculators continued to use two or more ICs, especially the scientific and the programmable ones, into the late 1970s.

The power consumption of the integrated circuits was also reduced, especially with the introduction of [[CMOS]] technology. Appearing in the Sharp "EL-801" in 1972, the [[transistor]]s in the logic cells of CMOS ICs only used any appreciable power when they changed state. The [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] and [[Vacuum fluorescent display|VFD]] displays often required added driver transistors or ICs, whereas the LCDs were more amenable to being driven directly by the calculator IC itself.

With this low power consumption came the possibility of using [[solar cell]]s as the power source, realised around 1978 by calculators such as the Royal ''Solar 1'', Sharp ''EL-8026'', and Teal ''Photon''.

====Mass market phase====
At the start of the 1970s, hand-held electronic calculators were very costly, at two or three weeks' wages, and so were a luxury item. The high price was due to their construction requiring many mechanical and electronic components which were costly to produce, and production runs that were too small to exploit economies of scale. Many firms saw that there were good profits to be made in the calculator business with the margin on such high prices. However, the cost of calculators fell as components and their production methods improved, and the effect of economies of scale was felt.

By 1976, the cost of the cheapest four-function pocket calculator had dropped to a few dollars, about 1/20th of the cost five years before. The results of this were that the pocket calculator was affordable, and that it was now difficult for the manufacturers to make a profit from calculators, leading to many firms dropping out of the business or closing down. The firms that survived making calculators tended to be those with high outputs of higher quality calculators, or producing high-specification scientific and programmable calculators.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Mid-1980s to present===
[[File:Elektronika MK-52.JPG|thumb|The [[Elektronika MK-52]] was a programmable RPN-style calculator that accepted extension modules; it was manufactured in the [[Soviet Union]] from 1985 to 1992]]
The first calculator capable of symbolic computing was the [[HP-28C]], released in 1987. It could, for example, solve quadratic equations symbolically. The first [[graphing calculator]] was the [[Casio fx-7000G]] released in 1985.

The two leading manufacturers, HP and TI, released increasingly feature-laden calculators during the 1980s and 1990s. At the turn of the millennium, the line between a graphing calculator and a [[handheld computer]] was not always clear, as some very advanced calculators such as the [[TI-89]], the [[TI-92 series|Voyage 200]] and [[HP-49G]] could [[derivative|differentiate]] and [[integral|integrate]] [[function (mathematics)|function]]s, solve [[differential equation]]s, run [[word processing]] and [[Personal information manager|PIM]] software, and connect by wire or [[infrared|IR]] to other calculators/computers.

The [[HP-12C|HP 12c]] financial calculator is still produced. It was introduced in 1981 and is still being made with few changes. The HP 12c featured the [[reverse Polish notation]] mode of data entry. In 2003 several new models were released, including an improved version of the HP 12c, the "HP 12c platinum edition" which added more memory, more built-in functions, and the addition of the algebraic mode of data entry.

[[Calculated Industries]] competed with the [[HP-12C|HP 12c]] in the mortgage and real estate markets by differentiating the key labeling; changing the “I”, “PV”, “FV” to easier labeling terms such as "Int", "Term", "Pmt", and not using the [[reverse Polish notation]]. However, CI's more successful calculators involved a line of construction calculators, which evolved and expanded in the 1990s to present. According to Mark Bollman,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Mark Bollman |url=http://mathcs.albion.edu/~mbollman/Calculators.html |title=Mark-&gt;'s Calculator Collection |publisher=Mathcs.albion.edu |date= |access-date=2011-07-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719135244/http://mathcs.albion.edu/~mbollman/Calculators.html |archivedate=2011-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a mathematics and calculator historian and associate professor of mathematics at Albion College, the "Construction Master is the first in a long and profitable line of CI construction calculators" which carried them through the 1980s, 1990s, and to the present.

Personal computers often come with a calculator utility program that emulates the appearance and functions of a calculator, using the [[graphical user interface]] to portray a calculator. One such example is [[Calculator (Windows)|Windows Calculator]]. Most [[personal data assistant]]s (PDAs) and [[smartphone]]s also have such a feature.

==Use in education==
In most countries, [[student]]s use calculators for schoolwork. There was some initial resistance to the idea out of fear that basic or [[elementary arithmetic]] skills would suffer. There remains disagreement about the importance of the ability to perform calculations ''in the head'', with some curricula restricting calculator use until a certain level of proficiency has been obtained, while others concentrate more on teaching [[Approximation|estimation]] methods and problem-solving. Research suggests that inadequate guidance in the use of calculating tools can restrict the kind of mathematical thinking that students engage in.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|authors=Thomas J.

{{dablink|For the canonical map of an algebraic variety into projective space, see [[Canonical bundle#Canonical maps]].}}

In mathematics, a '''canonical map''', also called a '''natural map''', is a map or morphism between objects that arises naturally from the definition or the construction of the objects being mapped against each other. In general it is the map which preserves the widest amount of structure, and it tends to be unique. In the rare cases where latitude in choice remains, the map is either conventionally agreed upon to be the most useful for further analysis, or sometimes simply the most elegant or beautiful known.

A closely related notion is a '''structure map''' or '''structure morphism'''; the map that comes with the given structure on the object. They are also sometimes called canonical maps.

A [[canonical isomorphism]] is a canonical map that is also an isomorphism (i.e., invertible).

In some contexts, it is necessary to address an issue of ''choices'' of canonical maps or canonical isomorphisms; see [[prestack#Definition|prestack]] for a typical example.

==Examples==
*If ''N'' is a [[normal subgroup]] of a group ''G'', then there is a canonical map from ''G'' to the [[quotient group]] ''G/N'' that sends an element ''g'' to the coset that ''g'' belongs to.
*If ''V'' is a [[vector space]], then there is a canonical map from ''V'' to the second [[dual space]] of ''V'' that sends a vector ''v'' to the linear functional ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''v''&lt;/sub&gt; defined by ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''v''&lt;/sub&gt;(λ) = λ(''v'').
*If ''f'' is a [[ring homomorphism]] from a commutative ring ''R'' to commutative ring ''S'', then ''S'' can be viewed as an [[algebra over a ring|algebra]] over ''R''. The ring homomorphism ''f'' is then called the structure map (for the algebra structure). The corresponding map on the [[prime spectrum|prime spectra]]: Spec(''S'') →Spec(''R'') is also called the structure map.
*If ''E'' is a [[vector bundle]] over a topological space ''X'', then the projection map from ''E'' to ''X'' is the structure map.
*In [[topology]], a canonical map is a function ''f'' mapping a set ''X'' → ''X'' (''X'' [[Modulo operation|modulo]] ''R''), where ''R'' is an [[equivalence relation]] in ''X'', that takes each ''x'' in ''X'' to the equivalence class ''&lt;nowiki&gt;[[x]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' modulo ''R''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Eq4UDgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA274&amp;pg=PA274|title=Handbook of Mathematics|last=Vialar|first=Thierry|date=2016-12-07|publisher=BoD - Books on Demand|isbn=9782955199008|language=en|pages=274}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2906">In [[mathematics]], two objects, especially systems of axioms or semantics for them, are called '''cryptomorphic''' if they are equivalent but not obviously equivalent.  This word is a play on the many [[morphism]]s in mathematics, but "cryptomorphism" is only very distantly related to "[[isomorphism]]", "[[homomorphism]]", or "morphisms". The equivalence may possibly be in some informal sense, or may be formalized in terms of a [[bijection]] or [[equivalence of categories]] between the mathematical objects defined by the two cryptomorphic axiom systems.

==Etymology==

The word was coined by [[Garrett Birkhoff]] before 1967, for use in the third edition of his book ''Lattice Theory''.  Birkhoff did not give it a formal definition, though others working in the field have made some attempts since.

==Use in matroid theory==

Its informal sense was popularized (and greatly expanded in scope) by [[Gian-Carlo Rota]] in the context of [[matroid]] theory: there are dozens of equivalent axiomatic approaches to matroids, but two different systems of axioms often look very different.  

In his 1997 book ''Indiscrete Thoughts'', Rota describes the situation as follows:

{{cquote|Like many another great idea, matroid theory was invented by one of the great American pioneers, [[Hassler Whitney]].  His paper, which is still today the best entry to the subject, flagrantly reveals the unique peculiarity of this field, namely, the exceptional variety of cryptomorphic definitions for a matroid, embarrassingly unrelated to each other and exhibiting wholly different mathematical pedigrees.  It is as if one were to condense all trends of present day mathematics onto a single finite structure, a feat that anyone would ''a priori'' deem impossible, were it not for the fact that matroids do exist.}}

Though there are many cryptomorphic concepts in mathematics outside of matroid theory and [[universal algebra]], the word has not caught on among mathematicians generally.  It is, however, in fairly wide use among researchers in matroid theory.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="964">'''Echo removal''' is the process of removing [[echo]] and [[reverberation]] artifacts from audio signals. The reverberation is typically modeled as the [[convolution]] of a (sometimes time-varying) [[impulse response]] with a hypothetical clean input signal, where both the clean input signal (which is to be recovered) and the impulse response are unknown. This is an example of an [[inverse problem]]. In almost all cases, there is insufficient information in the input signal to uniquely determine a plausible original image, making it an [[ill-posed problem]]. This is generally solved by the use of a [[regularization (physics)|regularization]] term to attempt to eliminate implausible solutions.

This problem is analogous to [[deblurring]] in the image processing domain.

'''Electoral Calculus''' is a [[political forecasting]] [[web site]] which attempts to predict future [[United Kingdom general election]] results. It considers national factors but excludes local issues.

== History ==
The site was developed by Martin Baxter,&lt;ref name="intute"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.intute.ac.uk/cgi-bin/fullrecord.pl?handle=20100408-11403823 | title=Electoral Calculus | publisher=[[Intute]]  |accessdate=17 October 2011 |quote=An independent UK election prediction site maintained by Martin Baxter. He attempts to apply scientific techniques to the electoral geography of Britain to predict the future general election results.}}&lt;/ref&gt; who is a financial analyst specialising in [[mathematical modelling]].&lt;ref name="open ruppert 2010"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ruppert|first=Evelyn|title=Data mobilisation and the UK 2010 Election|url=http://www.open.ac.uk/blogs/cresc/?p=17|work=CReSC: The Social Life of Methods|publisher=[[Centre for Research on Socio-Cultural Change]]|date=16 April 2010|accessdate=28 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910073110/http://www.open.ac.uk/blogs/cresc/?p=17|archive-date=10 September 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Main features ==

The site includes maps, predictions and analysis articles. It has a separate section for [[elections in Scotland]].&lt;ref name="keele"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.keele.ac.uk/depts/por/scotland.htm | title=Scottish Government and Politics on the Internet | publisher=[[Keele University]] | work=School of Politics, International Relations and Philosophy website | accessdate=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methodology ==

The site is based around the employment of scientific techniques on data about Britain's electoral geography,&lt;ref name="intute" /&gt; which can be used to calculate the [[uniform national swing]].&lt;ref name="telegraph young 2010"&gt;{{cite news|last=Young|first=Toby|title=Who predicted the result correctly?|url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/tobyyoung/100038566/who-predicted-the-result-correctly/|accessdate=25 May 2012|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=7 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It takes account of national polls and trends but excludes local issues.&lt;ref name="thisiskent 2012"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thisiskent.co.uk/MP-s-course-lose-seat/story-15932772-detail/story.html | archive-url=https://archive.is/20130505065719/http://www.thisiskent.co.uk/MP-s-course-lose-seat/story-15932772-detail/story.html | dead-url=yes | archive-date=5 May 2013 | title=MP's on course to lose his seat | work=thisiskent.co.uk | publisher=[[Northcliffe Media]] | date=27 April 2012 | accessdate=24 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The calculations were initially based on what is termed the ''Transition Model'', which is derived from the additive [[uniform national swing]] model.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21045">'''Equation-free modeling''' is a method for [[multiscale computation]] and [[computer-aided analysis]]. It is designed for a class of complicated systems in which one observes evolution at a macroscopic, coarse scale of interest, while accurate models are only given at a finely detailed, microscopic, level of description. The framework empowers one to perform macroscopic computational tasks (over large space-time scales) using only appropriately initialized microscopic simulation on short time and small length scales. The methodology eliminates the derivation of explicit macroscopic [[evolution equation]]s when these equations conceptually exist but are not available in closed form; hence the term equation-free.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| last1=Kevrekidis |first1=I.G.|authorlink=Yannís G.

==Introduction==
In a wide range of chemical, physical and biological systems, coherent macroscopic behavior emerges from interactions between microscopic entities themselves (molecules, cells, grains, animals in a population, agents) and with their environment. Sometimes, remarkably, a coarse-scale differential equation model (such as the [[Navier-Stokes equations]] for fluid flow, or a [[reaction-diffusion system]]) can accurately describe macroscopic behavior.  Such macroscale modeling makes use of general principles of conservation (atoms, particles, mass, momentum, energy), and closed into a well-posed system through phenomenological [[constitutive equations]] or [[equations of state]].  However, one increasingly encounters [[complex systems]] that only have known microscopic, fine scale, models. In such cases, although we observe the emergence of coarse-scale, macroscopic behavior, modeling it through explicit closure relations may be impossible or impractical. [[Non-Newtonian fluid]] flow, [[chemotaxis]], [[porous media]] transport, [[epidemiology]], brain modeling and neuronal systems are some typical examples.  Equation-free modeling aims to use such microscale models to predict coarse macroscale emergent phenomena.

Performing coarse-scale computational tasks directly with fine-scale models is often infeasible: direct simulation over the full space-time domain of interest is often computationally prohibitive. Moreover,  modeling tasks, such as numerical bifurcation analysis, are often impossible to perform on the fine-scale model directly: a coarse-scale steady state may not imply a steady state for the fine-scale system, since individual molecules or particles do not stop moving when the gas density or pressure become stationary. Equation-free modeling circumvents such problems by using short bursts of appropriately initialized fine-scale simulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Kevrekidis, I.G. |year=2003 |title=Equation-free, coarse-grained multiscale computation: enabling microscopic simulators to perform system-level tasks |journal=Comm. Math. Sciences |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=715–762 |mr=2041455 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The coarse time-stepper==
Dynamic problems invoke the coarse time-stepper.   In essence, short bursts of computational experiments with the fine-scale simulator estimate local time derivatives. Given an initial condition for the coarse variables &lt;math&gt;U(t_k)&lt;/math&gt; at time &lt;math&gt;t_k&lt;/math&gt;, the coarse time-stepper involves four steps:

* Lifting, creates microscale initial conditions &lt;math&gt;u(t_k)&lt;/math&gt;, consistent with the macrostate &lt;math&gt;U(t_k)&lt;/math&gt;;
* Simulation, uses the microscale simulator to compute the microscale state &lt;math&gt;u(t)&lt;/math&gt; at over a short interval &lt;math&gt;t_k\leq t \leq t_k+\delta t&lt;/math&gt;;
* Restriction, obtains the macrostate &lt;math&gt;U(t_k+\delta t)&lt;/math&gt; from the fine-scale state &lt;math&gt;u(t)&lt;/math&gt;;
* the Time-step, extrapolation of macrostate &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;t_k&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;t_{k+1}=t_k+\Delta t&lt;/math&gt; predicts the state a macrotime in the future.

Multiple time steps simulates the system into the macro-future.
If the microscale model is stochastic, then an ensemble of microscale simulations may be needed to obtain sufficiently good extrapolation in the time step.  Such a coarse time-stepper may be used in many algorithms of traditional continuum numerical analysis, such as numerical bifurcation analysis, optimization, control, and even accelerated coarse-scale simulation.

Traditionally, algebraic formulae determine time derivatives of the coarse model. In our approach, the macroscale derivative is estimated by the inner microscale simulator, in effect performing a closure on demand.  A reason for the name ''equation-free'' is by analogy with matrix-free numerical linear algebra;&lt;ref&gt;C. T. Kelley. ''Iterative Methods for linear and nonlinear equations'', SIAM, Philadelphia, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; the name emphasizes that  macro-level equations are never constructed explicitly in closed form.

===Restriction===
The restriction operator often follows directly from the specific choice of the macroscale variables. For example, when the microscale model evolves an ensemble of many particles, the restriction typically computes the first few moments of the particle distribution (the density, momentum, and energy).

===Lifting===
The lifting operator is usually much more involved. For example, consider a particle model: we need to define a mapping from a few low order moments of the particle distribution to initial conditions for each particle. The assumption that a relation exists that closes in these low order, coarse, moments, implies that the detailed microscale configurations are functionals of the moments (sometimes referred to as slaving &lt;ref&gt;H. Haken. Slaving principle revisited. ''Physica D'', 97:95–103, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;).  We assume this relationship is established/emerges on time scales that are fast compared to the overall system evolution (see [[slow manifold]] theory and applications &lt;ref&gt;A. J. Roberts. Effectively model dynamics, deterministic and stochastic, across multiple space and time scales. In J. G. Hartnett and P. C. Abbott, editors, ''Frontiers of Fundamental and Computational Physics: 10th International Symposium'', volume 1246, pages 75–87. AIP, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;).  Unfortunately, the closure (slaving relations) are algebraically unknown (as otherwise the coarse evolution law would be known).

Initializing the unknown microscale modes randomly introduces a lifting error: we rely on the separation of macro and micro time scales to ensure a quick relaxation to functionals of the coarse macrostates (healing). A preparatory step may be required, possibly involving microscale simulations constrained to keep the macrostates fixed.&lt;ref&gt;J. P. Ryckaert, G. Ciccotti, and H. Berendsen. Numerical integration of the Cartesian equation of motion of a system with constraints: molecular dynamics of N-alkanes. ''J. Comput. Phys.'', 23:237, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; When the system has a unique fixed point for the unknown microscale details conditioned upon the coarse macrostates,  a constrained runs algorithm may perform this preparatory step using only the microscale time-stepper.&lt;ref&gt;C. W. Gear, T. J.  Kaper, I. G. Kevrekidis, and A. Zagaris. Projecting to a Slow Manifold: Singularly Perturbed Systems and Legacy Codes. ''SIAM Journal on Applied Dynamical Systems'' 4(3):711–732, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===An illustrative example===
A toy problem illustrates the basic concepts.  For example, consider the [[differential equation]] system for two variables &lt;math&gt;(U(t),u(t))&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dU}{dt}=-U-u+2\,,\quad \frac{du}{dt}=100(U^3-u).&lt;/math&gt;
Capital &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; denotes the presumed macroscale variable, and lowercase &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; the microscale variable. This classification means that we assume a coarse model of the form &lt;math&gt;dU/dt=G(U)&lt;/math&gt; exists, although we do not necessarily know what it is.   Arbitrarily define the lifting from any given macrostate &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;(U,u)=(U,0.5)&lt;/math&gt;. A simulation using this lifting and the coarse time-stepper is shown in the figure.
[[File:EquationFreeProjectiveIntegration.png|400px|thumb|Equation-free coarse time-stepper applied to the illustrative example differential equation system using &lt;math&gt;\delta t=0.1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;U(0)=-1&lt;/math&gt;.]]

The solution of the differential equation rapidly moves to the [[slow manifold]]  &lt;math&gt;u\approx U^3&lt;/math&gt; for any initial data. The coarse time-stepper solution would agree better with the full solution when the 100 factor is increased. The graph shows the lifted solution (blue solid line) &lt;math&gt;(U,u)&lt;/math&gt;. At times &lt;math&gt;t=n\delta t&lt;/math&gt;, the solution is restricted and then lifted again, which here is simply setting &lt;math&gt;u(n\delta t)=0.5&lt;/math&gt;. The slow manifold is shown as a  red line. The right plot shows the time derivative of the restricted solution as a function of time (blue curve), as well as the time derivative &lt;math&gt;dU/dt&lt;/math&gt; (the coarse time derivative), as observed from a full simulation (red curve).

===On application to concrete multiscale problems===
The equation-free approach has been applied to many examples. The examples illustrate the various ways to construct and assemble the algorithmic building blocks.  Numerical analysis establishes the accuracy and efficiency of this approach. Additional numerical analysis  on other methods of this type has also been done.&lt;ref&gt;W. E and B. Engquist (2003). The heterogeneous multiscale methods ''Comm. Math. Sciences'' 1(1):87–132.&lt;/ref&gt;

Applying the equation-free paradigm to a real problem requires considerable care, especially defining the lifting and restriction operators, and the appropriate outer solver.

* The first challenge is to identify the macroscale observables.  They need to be complete enough so that the unknown microscale variables can be reliably reconstructed (lifted).  Physical arguments often the identify the macroscale observables.  Almost always one invokes densities, but there are some surprisingly simple examples where correlation functions are essential macroscale variables.&lt;ref&gt;W. R. Young, A. J. Roberts, and G. Stuhne. Reproductive pair correlations and the clustering of organisms. Nature, 412:328–331, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; If not resorting to physical arguments, then modern data-mining or manifold learning techniques, such as Isomap or diffusion maps, may obtain the macroscale variables from microscale simulation.&lt;ref&gt;R. R. Coifman et al. (2005). Geometric diffusions as a tool for harmonic analysis and structure definition of data: Diffusion maps Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 102(21):7426–7431.&lt;/ref&gt;
* There should be a clear separation between the time-scales of the macroscale observables and the time-scales of the remaining microscale modes quasi-equilibrate given any macrostate.
* Knowing the macroscale observables might not be sufficient.  One strategy to obtain such information is the baby-bathwater scheme which uses only appropriately initialized simulations.&lt;ref&gt;J. Li, P. G. Kevrekidis, C. W. Gear and I. G. Kevrekidis (2003). Deciding the nature of the coarse equation through microscopic simulations: the baby-bathwater scheme ''SIAM Multiscale Modeling and Simulation'' 1(3):391–407.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coarse bifurcation analysis==
The recursive projection method&lt;ref&gt;G.M. Schroff and H.B. Keller (1993). Stabilization of unstable procedures: the recursive projection method ''SIAM Journal on Numerical Analysis'' 30: 1099–1120.&lt;/ref&gt; enables the computation of [[bifurcation diagram]]s using legacy simulation code.  It also empowers the coarse time-stepper to perform equation-free bifurcation computations.  Consider the coarse time stepper in its effective form
:&lt;math&gt;\vec U^{n+1}=\vec S(\vec U^n,\lambda; \delta t),&lt;/math&gt;
which includes explicit dependence upon one or more parameters &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;.  Bifurcation analysis computes [[List of types of equilibrium|equilibria]] or [[periodic orbit]]s, their stability and dependence upon parameter &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;.

Compute a coarse equilibrium as a [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]] of the coarse time stepper
:&lt;math&gt;\vec U-\vec S(\vec U,\lambda; \delta t)=\vec 0.&lt;/math&gt;
In the equation-free context, the recursive projection method is the outer solver of this equation, and the coarse time-stepper enables this method to be performed using fine scale dynamics.

Additionally, for problems where the macroscale has continuous symmetries, one can use a template based approach &lt;ref&gt;C. Rowley and J. Marsden (2000). Reconstruction equations and the Karhunen–Loève expansion for systems with symmetry ''Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena'' 142: 1–19.&lt;/ref&gt; to compute coarse [[self-similar]] or [[travelling wave]] solutions as fixed points of a coarse time-stepper that also encodes appropriate rescaling and/or shifting of space-time and/or solution.
For example, self-similar diffusion solutions may be found as the [[probability density function]] of detailed [[molecular dynamics]].&lt;ref&gt;L. Chen, P. Debenedetti, C.W. Gear, and I.G. Kevrekidis (2004). From molecular dynamics to coarse self-similar solutions: a simple example using equation-free computation ''Journal of Non-Newtonian Fluid Mechanics'' 120: 215–223.&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative to the recursive projection method is to use Newton—Krylov methods.&lt;ref&gt;C.T. Kelley (1995). ''Iterative Methods for linear and nonlinear equations'' SIAM, Philadelphia.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coarse projective integration==

The coarse time stepper accelerates simulation over large macroscale times. In the scheme described above, let the large macro-time-step &lt;math&gt;\Delta t\gg\delta t&lt;/math&gt;, and be on the time scale of the slow coarse dynamics.  Let the computed &lt;math&gt;U^n\approx U(n\Delta t)&lt;/math&gt; in terms of the coarse variable, and let the microscale simulation compute &lt;math&gt;U^{n,k}\approx U(n\Delta t+k\delta t)&lt;/math&gt; from a local time simulation with initial condition that the coarse variable &lt;math&gt;U(n\Delta t)=U^n=U^{n,0}&lt;/math&gt;.  Then we approximate &lt;math&gt;U((n+1)\Delta t)&lt;/math&gt; via extrapolating over a gap by
:&lt;math&gt;U^{n+1}=U^{n,k}+(\Delta t-k\delta t)F(\vec U^n)&lt;/math&gt;
where, for example, simple linear extrapolation would be 
:&lt;math&gt;F(\vec U^n)=(U^{n,k}-U^{n,k-1})/\delta t&lt;/math&gt;
This scheme is the called coarse projective forward Euler, and is the simplest in the class.

The &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; steps taken before the extrapolation reflect that we must allow the system to settle onto a quasi-equilibrium (from the microscale point of view), so that we can make a reliable extrapolation of the slow dynamics.  Then the size of the projective integration step is limited by stability of the slow modes.&lt;ref&gt;C.W. Gear and I.G. Kevrekidis. Projective methods for stiff differential equations: problems with gaps in their eigenvalue spectrum . ''SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing'' 24(4):1091–1106, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Patch dynamics==

The spatial analogue of projective integration is the gap-tooth scheme.
The idea of the gap-tooth scheme is to perform simulations of small patches of space, the teeth, separated by unsimulated space, the gaps.
By appropriately coupling the small patches of simulations we create a large scale, coarse level, simulation of the spatially extended system.
When the microscale simulator is computationally expensive the gap-tooth scheme empowers efficient large scale prediction.
Furthermore, it does this without us ever having to identify an algebraic closure for a large scale model.
&lt;ref&gt;Kevrekidis, I.G. et al. (2003). Equation-free, coarse-grained multiscale computation: enabling microscopic simulators to perform system-level tasks ''Comm. Math. Sciences'' 1(4): 715–762.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Samaey, G.; Roose, D. and Kevrekidis, I.G. (2005). The gap-tooth scheme for homogenization problems ''SIAM Multiscale Modeling and Simulation'' 4: 278–306.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Roberts2007"&gt;Roberts, A.J. and Kevrekidis, I.G. (2007). General tooth boundary conditions for equation free modelling ''SIAM J. Scientific Computing'' 29(4): 1495–1510.&lt;/ref&gt;

The combination of the gap-tooth scheme with coarse projective integration is called patch dynamics.

===Coupling boundary conditions===

The key to the gap-tooth and patch scheme is the coupling of the small patches across unsimulated space.
Surprisingly, the generic answer is to simply use classic Lagrange interpolation, whether in one dimension&lt;ref name="Roberts2007"/&gt; or multiple dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;A. J. Roberts, T. MacKenzie, and J. Bunder. A dynamical systems approach to simulating macroscale spatial dynamics in multiple dimensions. ''J. Engineering Mathematics'', 86(1):175–207, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  This answer is related to the coupling in [[holistic discretization]] and theoretical support provided by the theory of [[slow manifold]]s.
The interpolation provides value or flux boundary conditions as required by the microscale simulator.  
High order consistency between the macroscale gap-tooth/patch scheme and the microscale simulation is achieved through high order Lagrange interpolation.

However, commonly the microscale is a noisy particle based or [[agent-based model]].
In such cases the relevant macroscale variables are averages such as mass and momentum density. 
Then one generally has to form averages over a core of each tooth/patch, and apply the coupling condition over a finite action region on the edges of each tooth/patch.
The provisional recommendation is to make these regions as big as half the tooth/patch.&lt;ref&gt;J. E. Bunder, A. J. Roberts, and I. Kevrekidis. Better buffers for patches in macroscale simulation of systems with microscale randomness. Technical report, [https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.1415], Dec 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
That is, for efficiency one makes the microscale tooth/patch as small as possible, but limited by the need to fit in action and core regions big enough to form accurate enough averages.

===Lifting===

Patch dynamics is the combination of the gap-tooth scheme and coarse projective integration.  Just as for normal projective integration, at the start of each burst of microscale simulation, one has to create an initial condition for each patch that is consistent with the local macroscale variables, and the macroscale gradients from neighboring interpolated patches.  The same techniques suffice.

==Open problems and future directions==

Assumptions and choices about the macroscale evolution are crucial in the equation-free scheme.  The key assumption is that the variables we choose for the macroscale coupling must effectively close on the chosen macroscale.  If the chosen macroscale length is too small then more coarse scale variables may be needed: for example, in fluid dynamics we conventionally close the PDEs for density, momentum and energy; yet in high speed flow especially at lower densities we need to resolve modes of molecular vibration because they have not equilibrated on the time scales of the fluid flow.  Qualitatively the same considerations apply to the equation-free approach.

For many systems appropriate coarse variables are more-or-less known by experience.  However, in complex situations there is a need to automatically detect the appropriate coarse variables, and then use them in the macroscale evolution.  This needs much more research utilizing techniques from data mining and manifold learning.  In some problems it could be that as well as densities, the appropriate coarse variables also need to include spatial correlations, as in the so-called Brownian bugs.&lt;ref&gt;W. R. Young, A. J. Roberts, and G. Stuhne. Reproductive pair correlations and the clustering of organisms. ''Nature'', 412:328–331, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

The macroscale may have to be treated as a stochastic system, but then the errors are likely to be much larger and the closures more uncertain.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1095">{{about|several concepts in mathematics that are called harmonic|other uses of the word|Harmonic (disambiguation)}}

In [[mathematics]], a number of concepts employ the word '''harmonic'''.  The similarity of this terminology to that of [[Harmonic|music]] is not accidental: the [[equations of motion]] of vibrating strings, drums and columns of air are given by formulas involving [[Laplacian]]s; the solutions to which are given by [[eigenvalue]]s corresponding to their modes of vibration.  Thus, the term "harmonic" is applied when one is considering [[Function (mathematics)|functions]] with [[Sine wave|sinusoidal]] variations, or solutions of [[Laplace's equation]] and related concepts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21422">The '''history of group theory''', a [[mathematics|mathematical]] domain studying [[group (mathematics)|groups]] in their various forms, has evolved in various parallel threads. There are three historical roots of [[group theory]]: the theory of [[algebraic equation]]s, [[number theory]] and [[geometry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|nb = yes|last = Wussing|year = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Kleiner|year = 1986|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Smith|year = 1906|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]], [[Niels Henrik Abel]] and [[Évariste Galois]] were early researchers in the field of group theory.
&lt;!--
include summary of the post 1870 work here --&gt;

==Early 19th century==
The earliest study of groups as such probably goes back to the work of Lagrange in the late 18th century.  However, this work was somewhat isolated, and 1846 publications of [[Augustin Louis Cauchy]] and Galois are more commonly referred to as the beginning of group theory.  The theory did not develop in a vacuum, and so three important threads in its pre-history are developed here.

===Development of permutation groups===
One foundational root of group theory was the quest of solutions of [[polynomial equation]]s of degree higher than 4. 

An early source occurs in the problem of forming an equation of degree ''m'' having as its roots ''m'' of the roots of a given equation of degree &lt;math&gt;n &gt; m&lt;/math&gt;. For simple cases the problem goes back to [[Johann van Waveren Hudde]] (1659). [[Nicholas Saunderson]] (1740) noted that the determination of the quadratic factors of a biquadratic expression necessarily leads to a sextic equation, and [[Le Sœur]]{{Ambiguous|date=August 2018}} (1748) and [[Edward Waring]] (1762 to 1782) still further elaborated the idea.&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt;

A common foundation for the theory of equations on the basis of the group of [[permutations]] was found by Lagrange (1770, 1771), and on this was built the theory of substitutions. He discovered that the roots of all resolvents (''résolvantes, réduites'') which he examined are rational functions of the roots of the respective equations. To study the properties of these functions he invented a ''Calcul des Combinaisons''. The contemporary work of [[Alexandre-Théophile Vandermonde]] (1770) also foreshadowed the coming theory.&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt;

[[Paolo Ruffini]] (1799) attempted a proof of the impossibility of solving the [[Quintic equation|quintic]] and higher equations. Ruffini distinguished what are now called intransitive and  [[Group action#Types of actions|transitive]], and imprimitive and [[primitive permutation group|primitive]] groups, and (1801) uses the group of an equation under the name ''l'assieme delle permutazioni''. He also published a letter from [[Pietro Abbati]] to himself, in which the group idea is prominent.&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt;

[[Image:Evariste galois.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Galois age fifteen, drawn by a classmate.]]
Galois found that if &lt;math&gt;r_1, r_2, \ldots, r_n&lt;/math&gt; are the ''n'' roots of an equation, there is always a group of permutations of the ''r'''s such that 
*every function of the roots invariable by the substitutions of the group is rationally known, and
*conversely, every rationally determinable function of the roots is invariant under the substitutions of the group.
In modern terms, the [[solvable group|solvability]] of the Galois group attached to the equation determines the solvability of the equation with radicals.

Galois is the first to use the words ''group'' (''groupe'' in French) and ''primitive'' in their modern meanings. He did not use ''primitive group'' but called ''equation primitive'' an equation whose Galois group is [[primitive group|primitive]]. He discovered the notion of [[normal subgroup]]s and found that a solvable primitive group may be identified to a subgroup of the [[affine group]] of an [[affine space]] over a [[finite field]] of prime order.&lt;ref&gt;Galois last letter:http://www.galois.ihp.fr/ressources/vie-et-oeuvre-de-galois/lettres/lettre-testament&lt;/ref&gt;

Galois also contributed to the theory of [[modular equation]]s and to that of [[elliptic function]]s. His first publication on group theory was made at the age of eighteen (1829), but his contributions attracted little attention until the publication of his collected papers in 1846 (Liouville, Vol. XI).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Galois|year = 1908|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Kleiner|year = 1986|loc = p. 202|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Galois is honored as the first mathematician linking group theory and [[field theory (mathematics)|field theory]], with the theory that is now called [[Galois theory]].&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt;

Groups similar to Galois groups are (today) called [[permutation group]]s, a concept investigated in particular by Cauchy. A number of important theorems in early group theory are due to Cauchy. [[Arthur Cayley]]'s ''On the theory of groups, as depending on the symbolic equation &lt;math&gt;\theta^n = 1&lt;/math&gt;'' (1854) gives the first abstract definition of [[finite group]]s.

===Groups related to geometry===
[[Image:Felix Klein.jpeg|right|thumb|150px|Felix Klein]]
[[Image:Sophus Lie.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Sophus Lie]]
Secondly, the systematic use of groups in geometry, mainly in the guise of [[symmetry group]]s, was initiated by [[Felix Klein]]'s 1872 [[Erlangen program]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Wussing|year = 2007|loc = &amp;#xa7;III.2|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of what are now called [[Lie group]]s started systematically in 1884 with [[Sophus Lie]], followed by work of [[Wilhelm Killing]], [[Eduard Study]], [[Issai Schur]], [[Ludwig Maurer]], and [[Élie Cartan]]. The discontinuous ([[discrete group]]) theory was built up by Klein, Lie, [[Henri Poincaré]], and [[Charles Émile Picard]], in connection in particular with [[modular form]]s and [[monodromy]].

===Appearance of groups in number theory===
[[Image:ErnstKummer.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Ernst Kummer]]
The third root of group theory was [[number theory]]. Certain [[abelian group]] structures had been implicitly used in [[number theory|number-theoretical]] work by [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], and more explicitly by [[Leopold Kronecker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Kleiner|year = 1986|loc = p. 204|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early attempts to prove [[Fermat's last theorem]] were led to a climax by [[Ernst Kummer]] by introducing [[class group|groups describing factorization]] into [[prime number]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Wussing|year = 2007|loc = &amp;#xa7;I.3.4|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Convergence===
[[Image:Jordan 4.jpeg|left|thumb|150px|Camille Jordan]]
Group theory as an increasingly independent subject was popularized by [[Joseph Alfred Serret|Serret]], who devoted section IV of his algebra to the theory; by [[Camille Jordan]], whose ''[[List_of_important_publications_in_mathematics#Trait.C3.A9_des_substitutions_et_des_.C3.A9quations_alg.C3.A9briques|Traité des substitutions et des équations algébriques]]'' (1870) is a classic; and to [[Eugen Netto]] (1882), whose ''Theory of Substitutions and its Applications to Algebra'' was translated into English by Cole (1892). Other group theorists of the 19th century were [[Joseph Louis François Bertrand]], [[Charles Hermite]], [[Ferdinand Georg Frobenius]], Kronecker, and [[Émile Léonard Mathieu|Émile Mathieu]];&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt; as well as [[William Burnside]], [[Leonard Eugene Dickson]], [[Otto Hölder]], [[E. H. Moore]], [[Peter Ludwig Mejdell Sylow|Ludwig Sylow]], and [[Heinrich Martin Weber]].

The convergence of the above three sources into a uniform theory started with Jordan's ''Traité'' and [[Walther von Dyck]] (1882) who first defined a group in the full modern sense.  The textbooks of Weber and Burnside helped establish group theory as a discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon writes in Burnside's Collected Works, "The effect of [Burnside's book] was broader and more pervasive, influencing the entire course of non-commutative algebra in the twentieth century."&lt;/ref&gt;  The abstract group formulation did not apply to a large portion of 19th century group theory, and an alternative formalism was given in terms of [[Lie algebra]]s.

==Late 19th century==
Groups in the 1870-1900 period were described as the continuous groups of Lie, the discontinuous groups, finite groups of substitutions of roots (gradually being called permutations), and finite groups of linear substitutions (usually of finite fields).  During the 1880-1920 period, groups described by presentations came into a life of their own through the work of Cayley, [[Walther von Dyck]], [[Max Dehn]], [[Jakob Nielsen (mathematician)|Jakob Nielsen]], [[Otto Schreier]], and continued in the 1920-1940 period with the work of [[Harold Scott MacDonald Coxeter|H. S. M. Coxeter]], [[Wilhelm Magnus]], and others to form the field of [[combinatorial group theory]].

Finite groups in the 1870-1900 period saw such highlights as the [[Sylow theorem]]s, Hölder's classification of groups of square-free order, and the early beginnings of the [[character theory]] of Frobenius. Already by 1860, the groups of automorphisms of the finite projective planes had been studied (by Mathieu), and in the 1870s Klein's group-theoretic vision of geometry was being realized in his [[Erlangen program]].  The automorphism groups of higher dimensional projective spaces were studied by Jordan in his ''Traité'' and included composition series for most of the so-called [[classical group]]s, though he avoided non-prime fields and omitted the [[unitary group]]s. The study was continued by Moore and Burnside, and brought into comprehensive textbook form by [[Leonard Dickson]] in 1901. The role of [[simple group]]s was emphasized by Jordan, and criteria for non-simplicity were developed by Hölder until he was able to classify the simple groups of order less than 200.  The study was continued by [[Frank Nelson Cole]] (up to 660) and Burnside (up to 1092), and finally in an early "millennium project", up to 2001 by Miller and Ling in 1900.

Continuous groups in the 1870-1900 period developed rapidly. Killing and Lie's foundational papers were published, Hilbert's theorem in invariant theory 1882, etc.  &lt;!-- When was the classification of semisimple Lie algebras finished? Here or in the next period?  Check Borel or Springer. --&gt;

==Early 20th century==
In the period 1900-1940, infinite "discontinuous" (now called [[discrete group]]s) groups gained life of their own.  Burnside's famous [[Burnside problem|problem]] ushered in the study of arbitrary subgroups of finite-dimensional linear groups over arbitrary fields, and indeed arbitrary groups.  [[Fundamental group]]s and [[reflection group]]s encouraged the developments of [[J. A. Todd]] and Coxeter, such as the [[Todd–Coxeter algorithm]] in combinatorial group theory.  [[Algebraic group]]s, defined as solutions of polynomial equations (rather than acting on them, as in the earlier century), benefited heavily from the continuous theory of Lie. [[Bernard Neumann]] and [[Hanna Neumann]] produced their study of [[Variety (universal algebra)|varieties of group]]s, groups defined by group theoretic equations rather than polynomial ones. &lt;!-- Baer also did some frightening stuff during this time.  Maybe also mention the developments of Abelian group theory during this time. --&gt;

Continuous groups also had explosive growth in the 1900-1940 period.  Topological groups began to be studied as such.  There were many great achievements in continuous groups: Cartan's classification of semisimple Lie algebras, [[Hermann Weyl]]'s theory of representations of compact groups, [[Alfréd Haar]]'s work in the locally compact case.

Finite groups in the 1900-1940 grew immensely.  This period witnessed the birth of [[character theory]] by Frobenius, Burnside, and Schur which helped answer many of the 19th century questions in permutation groups, and opened the way to entirely new techniques in abstract finite groups. This period saw the work of [[Philip Hall]]: on a generalization of Sylow's theorem to arbitrary sets of primes which revolutionized the study of finite soluble groups, and on the power-commutator structure of [[p-group]]s, including the ideas of [[regular p-group]]s and [[isoclinism of groups]], which revolutionized the study of p-groups and was the first major result in this area since Sylow. This period saw [[Hans Zassenhaus]]'s famous [[Schur-Zassenhaus theorem]] on the existence of complements to Hall's generalization of Sylow subgroups, as well as his progress on [[Frobenius group]]s, and a near classification of [[Zassenhaus group]]s. &lt;!-- Transfer results of Burnside, Frobenius, Schur, Grün.  Probably tons of other important things missing.  Check Wehrfritz for finite soluble. --&gt;

==Mid-20th century==
&lt;!-- 1940-1960 works well for several topics:
* finite groups:
** simple: includes Brauer but not Janko, missing at least some of Feit-Thompson-Suzki
** solbule: includes Wielandt, but not Carter,
* algebraic: includes Chevalley+Zariski, but I think not Tits,
* infinite:
** soluble: includes Hall, but I think not the more serious Grünberg stuff, with group rings and cohomology, check Robinson-Lennox
** check on when profinite got popular
** burnside problem: includes some progress
* continuous:
** locally compact: includes Mackey
** Lie: includes the Montgomery, Zippin regularity result

--&gt;

Both depth, breadth and also the impact of group theory subsequently grew. The domain started branching out into areas such as [[algebraic group]]s, [[group extension]]s, and [[representation theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Curtis |year = 2003|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in the 1950s, in a huge collaborative effort, group theorists succeeded to [[classification of finite simple groups|classify]] all finite [[simple group]]s in 1982. Completing and simplifying the proof of the classification are areas of active research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citations|last = Aschbacher|year = 2004|nb = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anatoly Maltsev]] also made important contributions to group theory during this time; his early work was in logic in the 1930s, but in the 1940s he proved important embedding properties of semigroups into groups, studied the isomorphism problem of group rings, established the Malçev correspondence for polycyclic groups, and in the 1960s return to logic proving various theories within the study of groups to be undecidable.  Earlier, [[Alfred Tarski]] proved elementary group theory [[decision problem|undecidable]].&lt;ref&gt;Tarski, Alfred (1953) "Undecidability of the elementary theory of groups" in Tarski, Mostowski, and [[Raphael Robinson]] ''Undecidable Theories''. North-Holland: 77-87.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- 1960-1980
* Finite:
** Simple: all the sporadics, odd-order, full Feit, Thompson, Suzuki, Glauberman glory
** Soluble: Carter, Schunk, classes of groups
** ModCharTh: Green, Janusz, more Brauer
* Discrete:
** algebraic: Tits, Lang
** burnside: mostly finished I think
** combinatorial: Mal'cev
* Continuous:
** Profinite: definitely around, coclass conjectures made
** analytic: ?, check Mackey's history for the early part
** 

--&gt;
The period of 1960-1980 was one of excitement in many areas of group theory.

In finite groups, there were many independent milestones.  One had the discovery of 22 new sporadic groups, and the completion of the first generation of the [[classification of finite simple groups]].  One had the influential idea of the [[Carter subgroup]], and the subsequent creation of formation theory and the theory of classes of groups.  One had the remarkable extensions of Clifford theory by Green to the indecomposable modules of group algebras.  During this era, the field of [[computational group theory]] became a recognized field of study, due in part to its tremendous success during the first generation classification.

In discrete groups, the geometric methods of [[Jacques Tits]] and the availability the surjectivity of [[Serge Lang]]'s map allowed a revolution in algebraic groups.  The [[Burnside problem]] had tremendous progress, with better counterexamples constructed in the 1960s and early 1980s, but the finishing touches "for all but finitely many" were not completed until the 1990s.  The work on the Burnside problem increased interest in Lie algebras in exponent ''p'', and the methods of [[Michel Lazard]] began to see a wider impact, especially in the study of ''p''-groups.

Continuous groups broadened considerably, with ''p''-adic analytic questions becoming important.  Many conjectures were made during this time, including the coclass conjectures.

==Late 20th century==
&lt;!-- 1980-2000
* Finite:
** Simple/ModRepTh: fusion systems, Puig's nilpotent blocks, amalgamation, post classification results
** Soluble: Doerk-Hawkes
** p-groups: completion of coclass proof
** CGT: grows from beginnings in the 70s to a full fledged discipline
** finite geometries: some important work here in this period
* Discrete: have to check some references. lots of progress on group rings of discrete groups
** geometry: Thurston's geometrization, orbifolds in general, knot theory in general
** combinatorial: automatic groups
** geometric: hyperbolic groups
* Continuous: have to check with an expert
--&gt;

The last twenty years of the 20th century enjoyed the successes of over one hundred years of study in group theory.

In finite groups, post classification results included the [[O'Nan–Scott theorem]], the Aschbacher classification, the classification of multiply transitive finite groups, the determination of the maximal subgroups of the simple groups and the corresponding classifications of [[primitive group]]s.  In finite geometry and combinatorics, many problems could now be settled.&lt;!-- list a few, should be a few in that 1981 proceedings, and in Cameron's textbook, and in the Design theory encyclopedia--&gt;  The modular representation theory entered a new era as the techniques of the classification were axiomatized, including fusion systems, Luis Puig's theory of pairs and nilpotent blocks.  The theory of finite soluble groups was likewise transformed by the influential book of Klaus Doerk and Trevor Hawkes which brought the theory of projectors and injectors to a wider audience.

In discrete groups, several areas of geometry came together to produce exciting new fields.  Work on [[knot theory]], [[orbifold]]s, [[hyperbolic manifold]]s, and groups acting on trees (the [[Bass–Serre theory]]), much enlivened the study of [[hyperbolic group]]s, [[automatic group]]s.  Questions such as [[William Thurston]]'s 1982 [[geometrization conjecture]], inspired entirely new techniques in [[geometric group theory]] and [[low-dimensional topology]], and was involved in the solution of one of the [[Millennium Prize Problems]], the [[Poincaré conjecture]].

Continuous groups saw the solution of the problem of [[hearing the shape of a drum]] in 1992 using symmetry groups of the [[laplacian operator]].  Continuous techniques were applied to many aspects of group theory using [[function space]]s and [[quantum group]]s.  Many 18th and 19th century problems are now revisited in this more general setting, and many questions in the theory of the representations of groups have answers.

==Today==
&lt;!-- 2000-today
This part should not contain any details, but just indicate that group theory's history is still being written.
--&gt;

Group theory continues to be an intensely studied matter. Its importance to contemporary mathematics as a whole may be seen from the 2008 [[Abel Prize]], awarded to [[John Griggs Thompson]] and [[Jacques Tits]] for their contributions to group theory.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12977">In mathematics, '''Kostant's convexity theorem''', introduced by {{harvs|txt|first=Bertram|last=Kostant|year=1973|authorlink=Bertram Kostant}},  states that the projection of every [[coadjoint orbit]] of a connected [[compact Lie group]] into the dual of a [[Cartan subalgebra]] is a [[convex set]]. It is a special case of a more general result for [[symmetric space]]s. Kostant's theorem is a generalization of a result of {{harvtxt|Schur|1923}}, {{harvtxt|Horn|1954}} and {{harvtxt|Thompson|1972}} for hermitian matrices. They proved that the projection onto the diagonal matrices of the space of all ''n'' by ''n'' complex self-adjoint matrices with given eigenvalues Λ = (λ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., λ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is the convex polytope with vertices all permutations of the coordinates of Λ.

Kostant used this to generalize the [[Golden–Thompson inequality]] to all compact groups.

==Compact Lie groups==
Let ''K'' be a connected compact Lie group with [[maximal torus]] ''T'' and [[Weyl group]] ''W'' = ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''K''&lt;/sub&gt;(''T'')/''T''. Let their Lie algebras be &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{t}&lt;/math&gt;. Let ''P'' be the orthogonal projection of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}&lt;/math&gt; onto &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{t}&lt;/math&gt; for some Ad-invariant inner product on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}&lt;/math&gt;. Then for ''X'' in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{t}&lt;/math&gt;, ''P''(Ad(''K'')⋅''X'') is the convex polytope with vertices ''w''(''X'') where ''w'' runs over the Weyl group.

==Symmetric spaces==
Let ''G'' be a compact Lie group and σ an involution with ''K'' a compact subgroup fixed by σ and containing the [[identity component]] of the fixed point subgroup of σ. Thus ''G''/''K'' is a [[symmetric space]] of compact type. Let  &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}&lt;/math&gt; be their Lie algebras and let σ also denote the corresponding involution of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{g}&lt;/math&gt;.  Let &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{p}&lt;/math&gt; be the −1 eigenspace of σ and let &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt; be a maximal Abelian subspace. Let ''Q'' be the orthogonal projection of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{p}&lt;/math&gt; onto &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt; for some Ad(''K'')-invariant inner product on &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{p}&lt;/math&gt;. Then for ''X'' in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt;, ''Q''(Ad(''K'')⋅''X'') is the convex polytope with vertices the ''w''(''X'') where ''w'' runs over the [[restricted Weyl group]] (the normalizer of &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt; in ''K'' modulo its centralizer).

The case of a compact Lie group is the special case where ''G'' = ''K'' × ''K'', ''K'' is embedded diagonally and σ is the automorphism of ''G'' interchanging the two factors.

==Proof for a compact Lie group==
Kostant's proof for symmetric spaces is given in {{harvtxt|Helgason|1984}}. There is an elementary proof just for compact Lie groups using similar ideas, due to {{harvtxt|Wildberger|1993}}: it is based on a generalization of the [[Jacobi eigenvalue algorithm]] to compact Lie groups.

Let ''K'' be a connected compact Lie group with maximal torus ''T''. For each positive root α there is a homomorphism of SU(2) into ''K''. A simple calculation with 2 by 2 matrices shows that if  ''Y'' is in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}&lt;/math&gt; and ''k'' varies in this image of SU(2), then ''P''(Ad(''k'')⋅''Y'') traces a straight line between ''P''(''Y'') and its reflection in the root α.  In particular the component in the α root space—its "α off-diagonal coordinate"—can be sent to 0. In performing this latter operation, the distance from ''P''(''Y'') to ''P''(Ad(''k'')⋅''Y'') is bounded above by size of the α off-diagonal coordinate of ''Y''. Let ''m'' be the number of positive roots, half the dimension of ''K''/''T''. Starting from an arbitrary ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; take the largest off-diagonal coordinate and send it to zero to get ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Continue in this way, to get a sequence (''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;). Then

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\|P^\perp(Y_{n+1})\|^2\le \left({m-1\over m}\right)\|P^\perp(Y_n)\|^2.}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus ''P''&lt;sup&gt;⊥&lt;/sup&gt;(''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) tends to 0 and

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\|P(Y_{n+1}-Y_n)\|\le \|P^\perp(Y_n)\|.}&lt;/math&gt;

Hence ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''P''(''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is a Cauchy sequence, so  tends to ''X'' in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{t}&lt;/math&gt;. Since ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''P''(''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) ⊕ ''P''&lt;sup&gt;⊥&lt;/sup&gt;(''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;), ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; tends to ''X''. On the other hand, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; lies on the line segment joining ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; and its reflection in the root α. Thus ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; lies in the Weyl group polytope defined by ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt;. These convex polytopes are thus increasing as ''n'' increases and hence ''P''(''Y'') lies in the polytope for ''X''. This can be repeated for each ''Z'' in the ''K''-orbit of ''X''. The limit is necessarily in the Weyl group orbit of ''X'' and hence ''P''(Ad(''K'')⋅''X'') is contained in the convex polytope defined by ''W''(''X'').

To prove the opposite inclusion, take ''X'' to be a point in the positive Weyl chamber. Then all the other points ''Y'' in the convex hull of ''W''(''X'') can be obtained by a series of paths in that intersection moving along the negative of a simple root. (This matches a familiar picture from representation theory: if by duality ''X'' corresponds to a dominant weight λ, the other weights in the Weyl group polytope defined by λ are those appearing in the irreducible representation of ''K'' with highest weight λ. An argument with lowering operators shows that each such weight is linked by a chain to λ obtained by successively subtracting simple roots from λ.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harvnb|Humphreys|1997}}
*{{harvnb|Duistermaat|Kolk|2000}}
&lt;/ref&gt;) Each part of the path from ''X'' to ''Y'' can be obtained by the process described above for the copies of SU(2) corresponding to simple roots, so the whole convex polytope lies in ''P''(Ad(''K'')⋅''X'').

==Other proofs==
{{harvtxt|Heckman|1982}} gave another proof of the convexity theorem for compact Lie groups, also presented in {{harvtxt|Hilgert|Hofmann|Lawson|1989}}. For compact groups, {{harvtxt|Atiyah|1982}} and {{harvtxt|Guillemin|Sternberg|1982}} showed that if ''M'' is a [[symplectic manifold]] with a Hamiltonian action of a torus ''T'' with Lie algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{t}&lt;/math&gt;, then the image of the [[moment map]]

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{M\rightarrow\mathfrak{t}^*}&lt;/math&gt;

is a convex polytope with vertices in the image of the fixed point set of ''T'' (the image is a finite set). Taking for ''M'' a coadjoint orbit of ''K'' in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}^*&lt;/math&gt;, the moment map for ''T'' is the composition

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{M\rightarrow\mathfrak{k}^*\rightarrow \mathfrak{t}^*.}&lt;/math&gt;

Using the Ad-invariant inner product to identify &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}^*&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{k}&lt;/math&gt;, the map becomes

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\mathrm{Ad}(K)\cdot X \rightarrow \mathfrak{t},}&lt;/math&gt;

the restriction of the orthogonal projection. Taking ''X'' in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{t}&lt;/math&gt;, the fixed points of ''T'' in the orbit Ad(''K'')⋅''X'' are just the orbit under the Weyl group, ''W''(''X''). So the convexity properties of the moment map imply that the image is the convex polytope with these vertices. {{harvtxt|Ziegler|1992}} gave a simplified direct version of the proof using moment maps.

{{harvtxt|Duistermaat|1983}} showed that a generalization of the convexity properties of the moment map could be used to treat the more general case of symmetric spaces. Let τ be a smooth involution of ''M'' which takes the symplectic form ω to −ω and such that ''t'' ∘ τ = τ ∘ ''t''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. Then ''M'' and the fixed point set of τ (assumed to be non-empty) have the same image under the moment map. To apply this, let ''T'' = exp &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt;, a torus in ''G''. If ''X'' is in &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt; as before the moment map yields the projection map

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\mathrm{Ad}(G)\cdot X \rightarrow \mathfrak{a}.}&lt;/math&gt;

Let τ be the map τ(''Y'') =  − σ(''Y''). The map above has the same image as that of the fixed point set of τ, i.e. Ad(''K'')⋅''X''. Its image is the convex polytope with vertices the image of the fixed point set of ''T'' on Ad(''G'')⋅''X'', i.e. the points ''w''(''X'') for ''w'' in ''W'' = N&lt;sub&gt;''K''&lt;/sub&gt;(''T'')/C&lt;sub&gt;''K''&lt;/sub&gt;(''T'').

==Further directions==
In {{harvtxt|Kostant|1973}} the convexity theorem is deduced from a more general convexity theorem concerning the projection onto the  component ''A'' in the [[Iwasawa decomposition]] ''G'' = ''KAN'' of a real semisimple Lie group ''G''. The result discussed above for compact Lie groups  ''K'' corresponds to the special case when ''G'' is the [[complexification]] of ''K'': in this case the Lie algebra of ''A'' can be identified with &lt;math&gt; i \mathfrak{t}&lt;/math&gt;. The more general version of Kostant's theorem has also been generalized to semisimple symmetric spaces by {{harvtxt|van den Ban|1986}}. {{harvtxt|Kac|Peterson|1984}} gave a generalization for infinite-dimensional groups.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1929">The '''Källén function''', also known as '''triangle function''', is a polynomial function in three variables, which appears in geometry and particle physics. In the latter field it is usually denoted by the symbol &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;. It is named after the theoretical physicist [[Gunnar Källén]], who introduced it as a short-hand in his textbook ''Elementary Particle Physics''.&lt;ref&gt;G. Källén, ''Elementary Particle Physics'', (Addison-Wesley, 1964)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The function is given by a quadratic polynomial in three variables
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda(x,y,z) \equiv x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 2xy - 2yz - 2zx.&lt;/math&gt;

==Applications==
In geometry the function describes the area &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; of a triangle with side lengths &lt;math&gt;a,b,c&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;A=\frac{1}{4} \sqrt{-\lambda(a^2,b^2,c^2)}.&lt;/math&gt;
See also [[Heron's formula]].

The function appears naturally in the [[Kinematics]] of [[Special relativity|relativistic]] particles, e.g. when expressing the energy and momentum components in the center of mass frame by [[Mandelstam variables]].&lt;ref&gt;E. Byckling, K. Kajantie, ''Particle Kinematics'', (John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd, 1973)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==
The function is (obviously) symmetric in permutations of its arguments, as well as independent of a common sign flip of its arguments:
:&lt;math&gt; \lambda(-x,-y,-z) = \lambda(x,y,z). &lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;y,z&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; the polynomial factorizes into two factors
:&lt;math&gt; \lambda(x,y,z) = (x-(\sqrt{y}+\sqrt{z})^2)(x-(\sqrt{y}-\sqrt{z})^2).&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;x,y,z&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; the polynomial factorizes into four factors
:&lt;math&gt; \lambda(x,y,z) = -(\sqrt{x}+\sqrt{y}+\sqrt{z})(-\sqrt{x}+\sqrt{y}+\sqrt{z})(\sqrt{x}-\sqrt{y}+\sqrt{z})(\sqrt{x}+\sqrt{y}-\sqrt{z}).&lt;/math&gt;

Its most condensed form is
:&lt;math&gt; \lambda(x,y,z) = (x-y-z)^2-4yz. &lt;/math&gt;

{{main|Duality (mathematics)}}

In [[mathematics]], a '''duality''', generally speaking, translates concepts, theorems or mathematical structures into other concepts, theorems or structures, in a one-to-one fashion, often (but not always) by means of an [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]] operation: if the dual of ''A'' is ''B'', then the dual of ''B'' is ''A''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="45975">In [[mathematics]], the [[classification of finite simple groups]] states that every [[Finite group|finite]] [[simple group]] is [[cyclic group|cyclic]], or [[alternating group|alternating]], or in one of 16 families of [[groups of Lie type]], or one of 26 [[sporadic group]]s.

The list below gives all finite simple groups, together with their [[order (group theory)|order]], the size of the [[Schur multiplier]], the size of the [[outer automorphism group]], usually some small [[group representation|representations]], and lists of all duplicates.

== Summary ==

The following table is a complete list of the 18 families of finite simple groups and the 26 sporadic simple groups, along with their orders. Any non-simple members of each family are listed, as well as any members duplicated within a family or between families. (In removing duplicates it is useful to note that no two finite simple groups have the same order, except that the group A&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''A''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(2) and ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(4) both have order 20160, and that the group ''B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''q'') has the same order as  ''C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''q'') for ''q'' odd, ''n''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;2. The smallest of the latter pairs of groups are ''B''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(3) and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(3) which both have order 4585351680.)

There is an unfortunate conflict between the notations for the alternating groups A&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and the groups of Lie type ''A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''q'').  Some authors use various different fonts for A&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; to distinguish them.  In particular,
in this article we make the distinction by setting the alternating groups A&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; in Roman font and the Lie-type groups ''A&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''q'') in italic.

In what follows, ''n'' is a positive integer, and ''q'' is a positive power of a prime number ''p'', with the restrictions noted. The notation (''a'',''b'') represents the greatest common divisor of the integers ''a'' and ''b''.

==[[Cyclic group]]s, Z&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;==
'''Simplicity:''' Simple for ''p'' a prime number.

'''Order:''' ''p''

'''Schur multiplier:''' Trivial.

'''Outer automorphism group:''' Cyclic of order ''p''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1.

'''Other names:''' Z/''p''Z

'''Remarks:''' These are the only simple groups that are not [[perfect group|perfect]].

==[[Alternating group]]s, A&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''n'' &gt; 4==
&lt;!-- Note that this page uses italic for group of Lie type A, but Roman for the alternating groups.--&gt;

'''Simplicity:''' Solvable for ''n'' &lt; 5, otherwise simple.

'''Order:''' ''n''!/2  when ''n''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1.

'''Schur multiplier:''' 2 for ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;5 or ''n''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;7, 6 for ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;6 or 7; see ''[[Covering groups of the alternating and symmetric groups]]''

'''Outer automorphism group:''' In general 2.  Exceptions: for ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2, it is trivial, and for [[outer automorphism group#The outer automorphisms of the symmetric groups|''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;6]], it has order 4 (elementary abelian).

'''Other names:''' Alt&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.

'''Isomorphisms:''' A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are trivial. A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is cyclic of order 3. A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is isomorphic to ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(3) (solvable).  A&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; is isomorphic to ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(4) and to ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(5). A&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; is isomorphic to ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(9) and to the derived group ''B''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(2)′. A&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; is isomorphic to ''A''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(2).

'''Remarks:''' An [[Index of a subgroup|index]] 2 subgroup of the [[symmetric group]] of permutations of ''n'' points when ''n''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1.

== Groups of Lie type ==

'''Notation:''' ''n'' is a positive integer,  ''q'' &gt; 1 is a power of a prime number ''p'', and is the order of some underlying [[finite field]]. The order of the outer automorphism group is written as  ''d''⋅''f''⋅''g'', where ''d'' is the order of the group of "diagonal automorphisms", ''f'' is the order of the (cyclic) group of "field automorphisms" (generated by a [[Frobenius automorphism]]), and ''g'' is the order of the group of "graph automorphisms" (coming from automorphisms of the [[Dynkin diagram]]). The notation (''a'',''b'') represents the greatest common divisor of the integers ''a'' and ''b''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1799">The '''Mishnat ha-Middot''' ({{lang-he|מִשְׁנַת הַמִּדּוֹת}}; "treatise of measures") is considered the earliest known Hebrew treatise on geometry. The treatise was discovered in the [[Munich Library]] by [[Moritz Steinschneider]], who dated it between 800 and 1200 C.E. [[Hermann Schapira]] argued the treatise dates from an earlier period and [[Solomon Gandz]] conjectured [[Rabbi Nehemiah]] (c. 150 C.E.) to be the author. The content resembles both the work of [[Hero of Alexandria]] (c. 100 C.E.) and that of [[al-Khwārizmī]] (c. 800 C.E.) and the proponents of the earlier dating therefore see it linking [[Greek mathematics|Greek]] and Islamic mathematics.

The ''Mishnat ha-Middot'' argues against the common belief that the Bible defines the [[geometry|geometric]] ratio [[π]] (pi) as being exactly equal to 3 and defines it as 3 1/7 instead.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

The cross product of two vectors in 3-space is defined as the vector perpendicular to the plane determined by the two vectors whose magnitude is the product of the magnitudes of the two vectors and the sine of the angle between the two vectors. So, if '''n''' is the unit vector perpendicular to the plane determined by vectors '''A''' and '''B''',

[[File:Nearest integer.svg|thumb|300px|A plot of the nearest integer function, rounding to the nearest even integer]]
In [[computer science]], the '''nearest integer function''' of [[real number]] ''x'' denoted variously by &lt;math&gt;[x]&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld | title=Nearest Integer Function | urlname=NearestIntegerFunction | accessdate= 2008-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;math&gt;\lfloor x \rceil&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Vert x \Vert&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=J.W.S. Cassels|title=An introduction to Diophantine approximation|series=Cambridge Tracts in Mathematics and Mathematical Physics|volume=45|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=1957|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; nint(''x''), or Round(''x''), is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] which returns the nearest [[integer]] to ''x''.  To avoid ambiguity when operating on [[half-integer]]s, a [[rounding]] rule must be chosen.  On most computer implementations{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}, the selected rule is to round half-integers to the nearest [[even number|even integer]]—for example, 
:&lt;math&gt;[1.25] = 1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;[1.50] = 2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;[1.75] = 2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;[2.25] = 2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;[2.50] = 2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;[2.75] = 3&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;[3.25] = 3&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;[3.50] = 4&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;[3.75] = 4&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;[4.50] = 4&lt;/math&gt;
:etc.
This is in accordance with the [[IEEE 754]] standards and helps reduce bias in the result.

There are many other possible rules for [[rounding#Tie-breaking|tie breaking]] when rounding a half integer include rounding up, rounding down, rounding to or away from zero, or random rounding up or down.

In [[probability]] and [[statistics]],  '''point process notation''' comprises the range of [[mathematical notation]] used to symbolically represent [[random]] [[Mathematical object|objects]] known as [[point process]]es, which are used in related fields such as [[stochastic geometry]], [[spatial statistics]] and [[continuum percolation theory]] and frequently serve as [[mathematical models]] of random phenomena, representable as points, in time, space or both.

The notation varies due to the histories of certain mathematical fields and the different interpretations of point processes,&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"&gt;D. Stoyan, W. S. Kendall, J. Mecke, and L. Ruschendorf. ''Stochastic geometry and its applications'', Second Edition, Section 4.1, Wiley Chichester, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="daleyPPI2003"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/b97277 | first1 = D. J. | last1 = Daley | first2 = D. | last2 = Vere-Jones| title = An Introduction to the Theory of Point Processes | series = Probability and its Applications | year = 2003 | isbn = 0-387-95541-0 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="haenggi2012stochastic"&gt;M. Haenggi. ''Stochastic geometry for wireless networks''. Chapter 2. Cambridge University Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  and borrows notation from mathematical areas of study such as [[measure theory]] and [[set theory]].&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt;

==Interpretation of point processes==

The notation, as well as the  terminology, of point processes depends on their setting and interpretation as mathematical objects which under certain assumptions can be interpreted as random [[sequences]] of points, random [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] of points or random [[counting measure]]s.&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt;

===Random sequences of points===

In some mathematical frameworks, a given point process may be considered as a sequence of points with each point randomly positioned in ''d''-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt; as well as some other more abstract [[mathematical space]]s.  In general, whether  or not  a random sequence is equivalent to the other interpretations of a point process depends on the underlying mathematical space, but this holds true for the setting of finite-dimensional Euclidean space '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="daleyPPII2008"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Daley | first1 = D. J. | last2 = Vere-Jones | first2 = D. | doi = 10.1007/978-0-387-49835-5 | title = An Introduction to the Theory of Point Processes | series = Probability and Its Applications | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-387-21337-8 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Random set of points===

A point process is called ''simple'' if no two (or more points) coincide in location with [[Almost surely|probability one]]. Given that often point processes are simple and the order of the points does not matter, a collection of random points can be considered as a random set of  points&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="baddeley2007spatial"&gt;{{Cite book | doi = 10.1007/978-3-540-38175-4_1 | first1 = A. | last1 = Baddeley | first2 = I. | last2 = Barany | first3 = R. | last3 = Schneider | first4 = W. | last4 = Weil| chapter = Spatial Point Processes and their Applications | title = Stochastic Geometry | series = Lecture Notes in Mathematics | volume = 1892 | pages = 1 | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-3-540-38174-7 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of random sets was independently developed by [[David George Kendall|David Kendall]] and [[Georges Matheron]]. In terms of being considered as a random set, a sequence of random points is a random closed set if the sequence has no [[Limit point#Types of limit points|accumulation points]] with probability one&lt;ref name="schneider2008stochastic"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Schneider | first1 = R. | last2 = Weil | first2 = W. | doi = 10.1007/978-3-540-78859-1 | title = Stochastic and Integral Geometry | series = Probability and Its Applications | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-3-540-78858-4 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A point process is often denoted by a single letter,&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kingman1992poisson"&gt;[[J. F. C. Kingman]]. ''Poisson processes'', volume 3. Oxford university press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="moller2003statistical"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Moller | first1 = J. | last2 = Plenge Waagepetersen | first2 = R. | doi = 10.1201/9780203496930 | title = Statistical Inference and Simulation for Spatial Point Processes | series = C&amp;H/CRC Monographs on Statistics &amp; Applied Probability | volume = 100 | year = 2003 | isbn = 978-1-58488-265-7 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; for example &lt;math&gt;  {N}&lt;/math&gt;, and if the point process is considered as a random set, then the corresponding notation:&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; x\in {N}, &lt;/math&gt;

is used to denote that a random point &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is an [[Element (mathematics)|element]] of (or [[Element (mathematics)#Notation and terminology|belongs]] to) the point  process &lt;math&gt;  {N}&lt;/math&gt;. The theory of random sets can be applied to point processes owing to this interpretation, which alongside the random sequence interpretation has resulted in a point process being written as:

:&lt;math&gt;  \{x_1, x_2,\dots \}=\{x\}_i,&lt;/math&gt;

which highlights its interpretation as either a random sequence or random closed set of points.&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt; Furthermore, sometimes an uppercase letter denotes the point process, while a lowercase denotes a point from the process, so, for example, the point &lt;math&gt;\textstyle x&lt;/math&gt; (or &lt;math&gt;\textstyle x_i&lt;/math&gt;) belongs to or is a point of the point process &lt;math&gt;\textstyle X&lt;/math&gt;, or with set notation, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle x\in X&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="moller2003statistical"/&gt;

===Random measures===

To denote the number of points of &lt;math&gt;  {N}&lt;/math&gt; located in some [[Borel set]] &lt;math&gt;  B&lt;/math&gt;, it is sometimes written &lt;ref name="kingman1992poisson"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \Phi(B) =\#( B \cap {N}), &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;  \Phi(B)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[random variable]] and &lt;math&gt;  \#&lt;/math&gt; is a [[counting measure]], which gives the number of points in some set. In this [[mathematical expression]] the point process is denoted by:

&lt;math&gt;  {N}&lt;/math&gt;.

On the other hand, the symbol:

&lt;math&gt;  \Phi &lt;/math&gt;

represents the number of points of &lt;math&gt;  {N}&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;  B&lt;/math&gt;. In the context of random measures,  one  can write:

&lt;math&gt;  \Phi(B)=n&lt;/math&gt;

to denote that there is the set &lt;math&gt;  B&lt;/math&gt; that contains &lt;math&gt;  n&lt;/math&gt; points of &lt;math&gt; {N}&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, a point process can be considered as a [[random measure]] that assigns some non-negative integer-valued [[Measure (mathematics)|measure]]  to sets.&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt; This interpretation has motivated a point process being considered just another name for a ''random counting measure''&lt;ref name="molvcanov2005theory"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/1-84628-150-4 | title = Theory of Random Sets | first = Ilya | last = Molchanov| series = Probability and Its Applications | year = 2005 | isbn = 1-85233-892-X | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|106}} and the techniques of random measure theory offering another way to study point processes,&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="grandell1977point"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Grandell | first1 = Jan | year = 1977 | title = Point Processes and Random Measures | journal = Advances in Applied Probability  | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 502–526 | publisher = Applied Probability Trust | jstor = 1426111 | url =  | format =  | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; which also induces the use of the various notations used in [[Integral#Terminology and notation|integration]] and measure theory. {{efn|As discussed in Chapter 1 of Stoyan, Kendall and Mechke,&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt; varying [[integral]] notation in general applies to all integrals here and elsewhere.}}

==Dual notation==

The different interpretations of point processes as random sets and counting measures is captured with the often used notation &lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="haenggi2012stochastic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="moller2003statistical"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BB1"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Baccelli | first1 = F. O. | title = Stochastic Geometry and Wireless Networks: Volume I Theory | doi = 10.1561/1300000006 | journal = Foundations and Trends in Networking | volume = 3 | issue = 3–4 | pages = 249–449 | year = 2009 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which:

* &lt;math&gt; {N}&lt;/math&gt; denotes a set of random points.
* &lt;math&gt; {N}(B)&lt;/math&gt; denotes a random variable that gives the number of points  of &lt;math&gt;  {N}&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;  B&lt;/math&gt; (hence it is a random counting measure).

Denoting the counting measure again with &lt;math&gt;  \#&lt;/math&gt;, this dual notation implies:

:&lt;math&gt; {N}(B) =\#(B \cap {N}). &lt;/math&gt;

==Sums==

If &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is some [[measurable function]] on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&lt;/sup&gt;, then the sum of &lt;math&gt;  f(x)&lt;/math&gt; over all the points &lt;math&gt;  x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;  {N} &lt;/math&gt; can be written in a number of ways &lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="haenggi2012stochastic"/&gt; such as:

:&lt;math&gt; f(x_1) + f(x_2)+ \cdots &lt;/math&gt;

which has the random sequence appearance, or with set notation as:

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{x\in {N}}f(x) &lt;/math&gt;

or, equivalently, with integration notation as:

:&lt;math&gt; \int_{\textbf{N}} f(x) {N}(dx) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;  \textbf{N}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Sample space|space]] of all possible counting measures, hence putting an  emphasis on the interpretation of &lt;math&gt;  {N}&lt;/math&gt; as a random counting measure. An alternative integration notation may be used to write this integral as:

:&lt;math&gt; \int_{\textbf{N}} f \, d{N} &lt;/math&gt;

The dual interpretation of point processes is illustrated when writing the number of &lt;math&gt;  {N}&lt;/math&gt; points in a set &lt;math&gt;  B&lt;/math&gt; as:

:&lt;math&gt; {N}(B)= \sum_{x\in {N}}1_B(x) &lt;/math&gt;

where the [[indicator function]] &lt;math&gt;  1_B(x) =1&lt;/math&gt; if the point &lt;math&gt;  x&lt;/math&gt; is exists in &lt;math&gt;  B&lt;/math&gt; and zero otherwise, which in this setting is also known as a [[Dirac measure]].&lt;ref name="BB1"/&gt; In this expression the random measure interpretation is on the [[left-hand side]] while the random set notation is used is on the right-hand side.

==Expectations==

The [[average]] or [[expected value]] of a sum of functions over a point process is written as:&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="haenggi2012stochastic"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; E\left[\sum_{x\in {N}}f(x)\right] \qquad \text{or} \qquad  \int_{\textbf{N}}\sum_{x\in {N}}f(x) P(d{N}), &lt;/math&gt;

where (in the random measure sense) &lt;math&gt;  P&lt;/math&gt; is an appropriate [[probability measure]] defined on the space of [[counting measure]]s &lt;math&gt;  \textbf{N}&lt;/math&gt;. The expected value of &lt;math&gt;  {N}(B)&lt;/math&gt;  can be written as:&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; E[{N}(B)]=E\left( \sum_{x\in {N}}1_B(x)\right) \qquad \text{or}  \qquad  \int_{\textbf{N}}\sum_{x\in {N}}1_B(x) P(d{N}). &lt;/math&gt;

which is also known as the first [[moment measure]] of  &lt;math&gt;  {N}&lt;/math&gt;. The expectation of such a random sum, known as a ''shot noise process'' in the theory of point processes, can be calculated with [[Campbell's theorem (probability)#Campbell's theorem: general point process|Campbell's theorem]].&lt;ref name="daleyPPI2003"/&gt;

==Uses in other fields==

Point processes are employed in other mathematical and statistical disciplines, hence the notation may be used in fields such [[stochastic geometry]], [[spatial statistics]] or [[continuum percolation theory]], and areas which use the methods and theory from these fields.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27765">A '''proof of impossibility''', also known as '''negative proof''', proof of an '''impossibility theorem''', or '''negative result''', is a [[Mathematical proof|proof]] demonstrating that a particular problem cannot be solved, or cannot be solved in general. Often proofs of impossibility have put to rest decades or centuries of work attempting to find a solution. To prove that something is impossible is usually much harder than the opposite task; it is necessary to develop a theory.&lt;ref&gt;Pudlák, pp. 255–256.&lt;/ref&gt; Impossibility theorems are usually expressible as universal propositions in logic (see [[universal quantification]]).

One of the most famous proofs of impossibility was the 1882 proof of [[Ferdinand von Lindemann]], showing that the ancient problem of [[squaring the circle]] cannot be solved, because the number [[Pi|{{math|π}}]] is [[Transcendental number|transcendental]] (non-algebraic) and only a subset of the [[algebraic numbers]] can be constructed by compass and straightedge. Two other classical problems—[[trisection|trisecting the general angle]] and [[doubling the cube]]—were also proved impossible in the nineteenth century.

A problem arising in the sixteenth century was that of creating a general formula using radicals expressing the solution of any polynomial equation of fixed degree ''k'', where ''k'' ≥ 5. In the 1820s, the [[Abel–Ruffini theorem]] showed this to be impossible using concepts such as [[solvable group]]s from [[Galois theory]], a new subfield of [[abstract algebra]].

Among the most important proofs of impossibility of the 20th century, were those related to [[undecidable problem|undecidability]], which showed that there are problems that cannot be solved in general by any algorithm at all. The most famous is the [[halting problem]].

In [[computational complexity theory]], techniques like relativization (see [[oracle machine]]) provide "weak" proofs of impossibility excluding certain proof techniques. Other techniques like proofs of [[Completeness (logic)|completeness]] for a [[complexity class]] provide evidence for the difficulty of problems by showing them to be just as hard to solve as other known problems that have proved [[Intractability (complexity)|intractable]].

==Types of impossibility proof==
{{See also|Types of proof}}

===Proof by contradiction===
One widely used type of impossibility proof is [[proof by contradiction]]. In this type of proof it is shown that if something, such as a solution to a particular class of equations, were possible, then two mutually contradictory things would be true, such as a number being both even and odd. The contradiction implies that the original premise is impossible.

====Proof by descent====
{{Main|Proof by infinite descent}}

One type of proof by contradiction is proof by [[infinite descent|descent]]. Here it is postulated that something is possible, such as a solution to a class of equations, and that therefore there must be a smallest solution; then starting from the allegedly smallest solution, it is shown that a smaller solution can be found, contradicting the premise that the former solution was the smallest one possible. Thus the premise that a solution exists must be false.

This method of proof can also be interpreted slightly differently, as the method of ''infinite descent''. One postulates that a positive integer solution exists, whether or not it is the smallest one, and one shows that based on this solution a smaller solution must exist. But by [[mathematical induction]] it follows that a still smaller solution must exist, then a yet smaller one, and so on for an infinite number of steps. But this contradicts the fact that one cannot find smaller and smaller positive integers indefinitely; the contradiction implies that the premise that a solution exists is wrong.

==Types of disproof of impossibility conjectures==
There are two alternative methods of proving wrong a conjecture that something is impossible: by counterexample ([[constructive proof]]) and by logical contradiction ([[non-constructive proof]]).

The obvious way to disprove an impossibility conjecture by providing a single [[counterexample]]. For example, [[Euler's sum of powers conjecture|Euler proposed]] that at least ''n'' different ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; powers were necessary to sum to yet another ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; power. The conjecture was disproved in 1966 with a counterexample involving a count of only four different 5th powers summing to another fifth power:
:27&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; + 84&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; + 110&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; + 133&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; = 144&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;.
A proof by counterexample is a [[constructive proof]].

In contrast, a [[non-constructive proof]] that something is ''not'' impossible proceeds by showing it is logically contradictory for ''all'' possible counterexamples to be invalid: At least ''one'' of the items on a list of possible counterexamples must actually be a valid counterexample to the impossibility conjecture. For example, a conjecture that it is impossible for an irrational power raised to an irrational power to be rational [[Irrational number#Irrational powers|was disproved]] by showing that one of two possible counterexamples must be a valid counterexample, without showing which one it is.

==The existence of irrational numbers: The Pythagoreans' proof==
The proof by [[Pythagoras]] (or more likely one of his students) about 500&amp;nbsp;[[BCE]] has had a profound effect on mathematics. It shows that the [[square root of 2]] cannot be expressed as the ratio of two integers (counting numbers). The proof bifurcated "the numbers" into two non-overlapping collections—the [[rational numbers]] and the [[irrational numbers]]. This bifurcation was used by [[Georg Cantor|Cantor]] in his [[Cantor's diagonal argument|diagonal method]], which in turn was used by Turing in his proof that the ''[[Entscheidungsproblem]]'' (the [[decision problem]] of [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]]) is undecidable.

{{quote|text=It is unknown when, or by whom, the "theorem of Pythagoras" was discovered. The discovery can hardly have been made by Pythagoras himself, but it was certainly made in his school. Pythagoras lived about 570&amp;ndash;490&amp;nbsp;BCE. Democritus, born about 470&amp;nbsp;BCE, wrote ''on irrational lines and solids''&amp;nbsp;...|source={{citation needed|date=July 2017}}|author=Heath}}

Proofs followed for various square roots of the primes up to 17.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
There is a famous passage in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]'' in which it is stated that [[Teodorus]] (Plato's teacher) proved the irrationality of
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{5}, ...,&lt;/math&gt;
taking all the separate cases up to the root of 17&amp;nbsp;square feet&amp;nbsp;...&amp;thinsp;.&lt;ref&gt;Hardy and Wright, p.&amp;nbsp;42&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A more general proof now exists that:

:The ''m''th root of an integer ''N'' is irrational, unless ''N'' is the ''m''th power of an integer ''n''".&lt;ref&gt;Hardy and Wright, p.&amp;nbsp;40&lt;/ref&gt;

That is,  it is impossible to express the ''m''th root of an integer ''N'' as the ratio {{frac|''a''|''b''}} of two integers ''a'' and ''b'' that share no common [[prime factor]] except in cases in which ''b''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.

==Impossible constructions sought by the ancient Greeks==
Three famous questions of [[compass and straightedge constructions|Greek geometry]] were how:

# ...&amp;nbsp;with compass and straight-edge to [[trisect any angle]],
# to construct a cube with a volume [[Doubling the cube|twice the volume of a given cube]]
# to construct a square [[squaring the circle|equal in area]] to that of a given circle.

For more than 2,000&amp;nbsp;years unsuccessful attempts were made to solve these problems; at last, in the 19th&amp;nbsp;century it was proved that the desired constructions are logically impossible.&lt;ref&gt;Nagel and Newman p.&amp;nbsp;8&lt;/ref&gt;

A fourth problem of the ancient Greeks was to construct an [[equilateral polygon]] with a specified number ''n'' of sides, beyond the basic cases ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3, 4, 5 that they knew how to construct.

All of these are problems in [[Constructible number|Euclidean construction]], and Euclidean constructions can be done only if they involve only [[Euclidean number]]s (by definition of the latter) (Hardy and Wright p.&amp;nbsp;159). Irrational numbers can be Euclidean. A good example is the irrational number the square root of 2. It is simply the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs both one unit in length, and it can be constructed with straightedge and compass. But it was proved centuries after Euclid that Euclidean numbers cannot involve any operations other than addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and the extraction of square roots.

===Angle trisection and doubling the cube===
Both [[trisecting the angle|trisecting the general angle]] and [[doubling the cube]] require taking [[cube root]]s, which are not [[constructible numbers]] by compass and straightedge.

===Squaring the circle===
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; is not a [[Euclidean number]] ... and therefore it is impossible to construct, by Euclidean methods a length equal to the circumference of a circle of unit diameter&lt;ref&gt;Hardy and Wright p.&amp;nbsp;176&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A proof exists to demonstrate that any Euclidean number is an [[algebraic number]]—a number that is the solution to some [[polynomial equation]]. Therefore, because &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; was proved in 1882 to be a [[transcendental number]] and thus by definition not an algebraic number, it is not a Euclidean number. Hence the construction of a length &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; from a unit circle is impossible&lt;ref&gt;Hardy and Wright p.&amp;nbsp;159 referenced by E. Hecke. (1923). ''Vorlesungen über die Theorie der algebraischen Zahlen''. Leipzig: Akademische Verlagsgesellschaft&lt;/ref&gt;, and the circle cannot be squared.

===Constructing an equilateral ''n''-gon===
The [[Constructible polygon#Conditions for constructibility|Gauss-Wantzel theorem]] showed in 1837 that constructing an equilateral ''n''-gon is impossible for most values of ''n''.

==Euclid's parallel axiom==
{{Main|Non-Euclidean geometry}}
Nagel and Newman consider the question raised by the [[parallel postulate]] to be "...perhaps the most significant development in its long-range effects upon subsequent mathematical history" (p.&amp;nbsp;9).

The question is: can the axiom that two parallel lines "...will not meet even 'at infinity'" (footnote, ibid) be derived from the other axioms of Euclid's geometry? It was not until work in the nineteenth century by "... Gauss, Bolyai, Lobachevsky, and Riemann, that the impossibility of deducing the parallel axiom from the others was demonstrated. This outcome was of the greatest intellectual importance. ...a ''proof'' can be given of the ''impossibility of proving'' certain propositions [in this case, the parallel postlate] within a given system [in this case, Euclid's first four postulates]". (p.&amp;nbsp;10)

==Fermat's Last Theorem==
{{Main|Fermat's Last Theorem}}

[[Fermat's Last Theorem]] was conjectured by [[Pierre de Fermat]] in the 1600s, states the impossibility of finding solutions in positive integers for the equation &lt;math&gt;x^n+y^n=z^n&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;n&gt;2&lt;/math&gt;. [[Pierre de Fermat|Fermat]] himself gave a proof for the ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4 case using his technique of [[infinite descent]], and other special cases were subsequently proved, but the general case was not proved until 1994 by [[Andrew Wiles]].

==Richard's paradox==
{{Main|Richard's paradox}}
This profound paradox presented by [[Jules Richard]] in 1905 informed the work of [[Kurt Gödel]] (cf Nagel and Newman p.&amp;nbsp;60ff) and Alan Turing. A succinct definition is found in ''[[Principia Mathematica]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://quod.lib.umich.edu/u/umhistmath/AAT3201.0001.001/86?rgn=full+text;view=pdf ''Principia Mathematica'', 2nd edition 1927, p.&amp;nbsp;61, 64] in [http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=umhistmath;idno=AAT3201.0001.001 ''Principia Mathematica online'', Vol.1] at University of Michigan Historical Math Collection&lt;/ref&gt;:
{{quote|text=Richard's paradox ... is as follows. Consider all decimals that can be defined by means of a '''finite number of''' '''''words''''' &lt;small&gt;[“words” are symbols; boldface added for emphasis]&lt;/small&gt;; let ''E'' be the class of such decimals. Then ''E'' has &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt; &lt;small&gt;[an infinite number of]&lt;/small&gt; terms; hence its members can be ordered as the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, ... Let ''X'' be a number defined as follows &lt;small&gt;[Whitehead &amp; Russell now employ the Cantor diagonal method]&lt;/small&gt;.
&lt;br/&gt;If the ''n''-th figure in the ''n''-th decimal is ''p'', let the ''n''-th figure in ''X'' be ''p''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 (or 0, if ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;9). Then ''X'' is different from all the members of ''E'', since, whatever finite value ''n'' may have, the ''n''-th figure in ''X'' is different from the ''n''-th figure in the ''n''-th of the decimals composing ''E'', and therefore ''X'' is different from the ''n''-th decimal. Nevertheless we have defined ''X'' in a finite number of words &lt;small&gt;[i.e. this very definition of “word” above.]&lt;/small&gt; and therefore ''X'' ought to be a member of ''E''. Thus ''X'' both is and is not a member of E.|source=''Principia Mathematica'', 2nd edition 1927, p.&amp;nbsp;61}}

Kurt Gödel considered his proof to be “an analogy” of Richard's paradox, which he called “''Richard's antinomy''”.&lt;ref&gt;Gödel in ''Undecidable'', p.&amp;nbsp;9&lt;/ref&gt; See more below about Gödel's proof.

[[Alan Turing]] constructed this paradox with a machine and proved that this machine could not answer a simple question: will this machine be able to determine if any machine (including itself) will become trapped in an unproductive ‘[[infinite loop]]’ (i.e. it fails to continue its computation of the diagonal number).

==Can this theorem be proved from these axioms? Gödel's proof==
{{Main|Gödel's incompleteness theorems}}
To quote Nagel and Newman (p.&amp;nbsp;68), "Gödel's paper is difficult. Forty-six preliminary definitions, together with several important preliminary theorems, must be mastered before the main results are reached" (p.&amp;nbsp;68). In fact, Nagel and Newman required a 67-page introduction to their exposition of the proof. But if the reader feels strong enough to tackle the paper, Martin Davis observes that "This remarkable paper is not only an intellectual landmark, but is written with a clarity and vigor that makes it a pleasure to read" (Davis in Undecidable, p.&amp;nbsp;4). It is recommended{{By whom|date=August 2010}} that most readers see Nagel and Newman first.

So what did Gödel prove? In his own words:

: "It is reasonable... to make the conjecture that ...[the] axioms [from [[Principia Mathematica]] and [[Peano]] ] are ... sufficient to decide all mathematical questions which can be formally expressed in the given systems. In what follows it will be shown that this is not the case, but rather that ... there exist relatively simple problems of the theory of ordinary whole numbers which cannot be decided on the basis of the axioms" (Gödel in Undecidable, p. 4).

Gödel compared his proof to "Richard's antinomy" (an "[[antinomy]]" is a contradiction or a paradox; for more see [[Richard's paradox]]):

: "The analogy of this result with Richard's antinomy is immediately evident; there is also a close relationship [14] with the [[Liar Paradox]] (Gödel's footnote 14: Every [[epistemological]] antinomy can be used for a similar proof of undecidability)... Thus we have a proposition before us which asserts its own unprovability [15]. (His footnote 15: Contrary to appearances, such a proposition is not circular, for, to begin with, it asserts the unprovability of a quite definite formula)" (Gödel in Undecidable, p.9).

==Will this computing machine lock in a "circle"? Turing's first proof==
* The ''[[Entscheidungsproblem]]'', the [[decision problem]], was first answered by Church in April 1935 and preempted Turing by over a year, as Turing's paper was received for publication in May 1936. (Also received for publication in 1936—in October, later than Turing's—was a short paper by Emil Post that discussed the reduction of an algorithm to a simple machine-like "method" very similar to Turing's computing machine model (see [[Post–Turing machine]] for details).
* Turing's proof is made difficult by number of definitions required and its subtle nature. See [[Turing machine]] and [[Turing's proof]] for details.
* Turing's first proof (of three) follows the schema of Richard's Paradox: Turing's computing machine is an algorithm represented by a string of seven letters in a "computing machine". Its "computation" is to test ''all'' computing machines (including itself) for "circles", and form a diagonal number from the computations of the non-circular or "successful" computing machines. It does this, starting in sequence from 1, by converting the numbers (base 8) into strings of seven letters to test. When it arrives at its own number, it creates ''its own'' letter-string. It decides it is the letter-string of a successful machine, but when it tries to do this machine's (''its own'') computation it locks in a circle and can't continue. Thus we have arrived at Richard's paradox. (If you are bewildered see Turing's proof for more).

A number of similar undecidability proofs appeared soon before and after Turing's proof:

# April 1935: Proof of [[Alonzo Church]] (''An Unsolvable Problem of Elementary Number Theory''). His proof was to "...propose a definition of effective calculability ... and to show, by means of an example, that not every problem of this class is solvable" (Undecidable p.&amp;nbsp;90))
# 1946: [[Post correspondence problem]] (cf Hopcroft and Ullman&lt;ref name="Hopcroft.Ullman.1979"&gt;{{cite book| author=[[John E. Hopcroft]], [[Jeffrey D. Ullman]]| title=Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation| year=1979| publisher=Addison-Wesley| isbn=0-201-02988-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; p.&amp;nbsp;193ff, p.&amp;nbsp;407 for the reference)
# April 1947: Proof of [[Emil Post]] (''Recursive Unsolvability of a Problem of Thue'') (Undecidable p.&amp;nbsp;293). This has since become known as "The Word problem of Thue" or "Thue's Word Problem" ([[Axel Thue]] proposed this problem in a paper of 1914 (cf References to Post's paper in Undecidable, p.&amp;nbsp;303)).
# [[Rice's theorem]]: a generalized formulation of Turing's second theorem (cf Hopcroft and Ullman&lt;ref name="Hopcroft.Ullman.1979"/&gt; p.&amp;nbsp;185ff)&lt;ref&gt;"...there can be no machine E which ... will determine whether M [an arbitrary machine] ever prints a given symbol (0 say)" (Undecidable p. 134). Turing makes an odd assertion at the end of this proof that sounds remarkably like Rice's Theorem:
:"...each of these "general process" problems can be expressed as a problem concerning a general process for determining whether a given integer n has a property G(n)... and this is equivalent to computing a number whose nth figure is 1 if G(n) is true and 0 if it is false" (Undecidable p 134). Unfortunately he doesn't clarify the point further, and the reader is left confused.
&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Greibach's theorem]]: undecidability in language theory (cf Hopcroft and Ullman&lt;ref name="Hopcroft.Ullman.1979"/&gt; p.&amp;nbsp;205ff and reference on p.&amp;nbsp;401 ibid: [[Sheila Greibach|Greibach]] [1963] "The undecidability of the ambiguity problem for minimal lineal grammars," ''Information and Control'' 6:2, 117–125, also reference on p.&amp;nbsp;402 ibid: Greibach [1968] "A note on undecidable properties of formal languages", Math Systems Theory 2:1, 1–6.)
# [[Penrose tiling]] questions
# Question of solutions for [[Diophantine equations]] and the resultant answer in the MRDP Theorem; see entry below.

==Can this string be compressed? Chaitin's proof==
{{Main|Chaitin's incompleteness theorem}}
For an exposition suitable for non-specialists see Beltrami p.&amp;nbsp;108ff. Also see Franzen Chapter 8 pp.&amp;nbsp;137–148, and Davis pp.&amp;nbsp;263–266. Franzén's discussion is significantly more complicated than Beltrami's and delves into Ω—[[Gregory Chaitin]]'s so-called "halting probability". Davis's older treatment approaches the question from a [[Turing machine]] viewpoint. Chaitin has written a number of books about his endeavors and the subsequent philosophic and mathematical fallout from them.

A string is [[Kolmogorov complexity#Kolmogorov randomness|called]] ''(algorithmically) random'' if it cannot be produced from any shorter computer program. While [[Kolmogorov complexity#Compression|most strings are random]], no particular one can be proved so, except for finitely many short ones:

: "A paraphrase of Chaitin's result is that there can be no formal proof that a sufficiently long string is random..." (Beltrami p. 109)

Beltrami observes that "Chaitin's proof is related to a paradox posed by Oxford librarian G. Berry early in the twentieth century that asks for 'the smallest positive integer that cannot be defined by an English sentence with fewer than 1000 characters.' Evidently, the shortest definition of this number must have at least 1000 characters. However, the sentence within quotation marks, which is itself a definition of the alleged number is less than 1000 characters in length!" (Beltrami, p.&amp;nbsp;108)

==Does this Diophantine equation have an integer solution? Hilbert's tenth problem==
{{Main|Matiyasevich's theorem|Hilbert's problems}}

The question "Does any arbitrary "Diophantine equation" have an integer solution?" is [[Undecidable problem|undecidable]].That is, it is impossible to answer the question for all cases.

Franzén introduces [[Hilbert's tenth problem]] and the [[Matiyasevich's theorem|MRDP theorem]] (Matiyasevich-Robinson-Davis-Putnam theorem) which states that "no algorithm exists which can decide whether or not a Diophantine equation has ''any'' solution at all".  MRDP uses the undecidability proof of Turing: "... the set of solvable Diophantine equations is an example of a computably enumerable but not decidable set, and the set of unsolvable Diophantine equations is not computably enumerable" (p.&amp;nbsp;71).

==In social science==
In [[political science]], [[Arrow's impossibility theorem]] states that it is impossible to devise a [[voting system]] that satisfies a set of five specific axioms. This theorem is proved by showing that four of the axioms together imply the opposite of the fifth.

In [[economics]], [[Holmström's theorem]] is an impossibility theorem proving that no incentive system for a team of agents can satisfy all of three desirable criteria.

==In natural science==
In [[natural science]], impossibility assertions (like other assertions) come to be widely accepted as overwhelmingly probable rather than considered proved to the point of being unchallengeable. The basis for this strong acceptance is a combination of extensive evidence of something not occurring, combined with an underlying theory, very successful in making predictions, whose assumptions lead logically to the conclusion that something is impossible.

Two examples of widely accepted impossibilities in [[physics]] are [[perpetual motion machine]]s, which violate the law of [[conservation of energy]], and exceeding the [[speed of light]], which violates the implications of [[special relativity]]. Another is the [[uncertainty principle]] of [[quantum mechanics]], which asserts the impossibility of simultaneously knowing both the position and the momentum of a particle. Also [[Bell's theorem]]: no physical theory of local hidden variables can ever reproduce all of the predictions of quantum mechanics.

While an impossibility assertion in science can never be absolutely proved, it could be refuted by the observation of a single [[counterexample]]. Such a counterexample would require that the assumptions underlying the theory that implied the impossibility be re-examined.

In [[mathematics]], a property is any characteristic that applies to a given set.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mathsisfun.com/sets/sets-introduction.html Retrieved October 15 2018&lt;/ref&gt; Rigorously, a property ''p'' defined for all elements of a set ''X'' is usually defined as a function ''p'': ''X'' →  {true, false}, that is true whenever the property holds; or equivalently, as the subset of ''X'' for which ''p'' holds; i.e. the set {''x''&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;''p''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;true}; ''p'' is its [[indicator function]]. However, it may be objected that the rigorous definition defines merely the [[extension (semantics)|extension]] of a property, and says nothing about what causes the property to hold for exactly those values.

Examples of properties include the [[commutative property]] of [[real number|real]] and [[complex number]]s and the [[distributive property]].

[[Image:Protractor2.jpg|thumb|right|A half circle protractor marked in degrees (180°).]]
A '''protractor''' is a [[measuring instrument]], typically made of transparent plastic or glass, for measuring [[angle]]s. Most protractors measure angles in
[[degree (angle)|degree]]s (°). Radian-scale protractors measure angles in [[radians]]. Most protractors are divided into 180 equal parts.

They are used for a variety of mechanical and engineering-related applications, but perhaps the most common use is in geometry lessons in schools.

Some protractors are simple half-discs.  More advanced protractors, such as the [[#Bevel protractor|bevel protractor]], have one or two swinging arms, which can be used to help measure the angle.

==Bevel protractor==
{{Expert-subject|date=January 2012}}

A bevel protractor is a graduated circular protractor with one pivoted arm; used for measuring or marking off angles. Sometimes [[Vernier scale]]s are attached to give more precise readings. It has wide application in architectural and mechanical drawing, although its use is decreasing with the availability of modern drawing software or [[CAD]].

Universal bevel protractors are also used by toolmakers; as they measure angles by mechanical contact they are classed as mechanical protractors.&lt;ref name="Magazines1993"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hearst Magazines|title=Popular Mechanics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4eMDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA76|accessdate=7 July 2011|date=December 1993|publisher=Hearst Magazines|pages=76–|ISSN=00324558 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The bevel protractor is used to establish and test angles to very close tolerances. It reads to 5 minutes or 1/12°{{Clarify|date=January 2012}} and can measure any angle from 0° to 360°.
  
The bevel protractor consists of a beam, a graduated dial and a blade which is connected to a swivel plate (with Vernier scale) by thumb nut and clamp. When the edges of the beam and blade are parallel, a small mark on the swivel plate coincides with the zero line on the graduated dial. To measure an angle between the beam and the blade of 90° or less, the reading may be obtained direct from the graduation number on the dial indicated by the mark on the swivel plate. To measure an angle of over 90°, subtract the number of degrees as indicated on the dial from 180°, as the dial is graduated from opposite zero marks to 90° each way.
  
Since the spaces, both on the main scale and the Vernier scale, are numbered both to the right and to the left from zero, any angle can be measured. The readings can be taken either to the right or to the left, according to the direction in which the zero on the main scale is moved.

The above picture illustrates a variety of uses of the bevel protractor.
 
Reading the Vernier scale:

The bevel protractor Vernier scale may have graduations of 5′ (minutes) or 1/12°. Each space on the Vernier scale is 5′ less than two spaces on the main scale{{Clarify|date=January 2012}}. Twenty four spaces on the Vernier scale equal in extreme length twenty three double degrees{{Clarify|date=January 2012}}. Thus the difference between the space occupied by 2° on a main scale and the space of the Vernier scale is equal to one twenty-fourth of 2°, or 5′.

Read off directly from the main scale the number of whole degrees between 0 on this scale and the 0 of the Vernier scale. Then count, in the same direction, the number of spaces from the zero on the Vernier scale to a line that coincides with a line on the main scale; multiply this number by 5 and the product will be the number of minutes to be added to the whole number of degrees.
 
For example: Zero on the vernier scale has moved 28 whole degrees to the right of the 0 on the main scale and the 3rd line on the vernier scale coincides with a line upon the main scale as  indicated. Multiplying 3 by 5, the product, 15, is the number of minutes to be added to the whole number of degrees, thus indicating a setting of 28 degrees and 15 minutes.

== Two Sided Protractor ==
Protractors have traditionally been one-sided. This is thought to be because early manufacturing methods set the tone of future production. Unfortunately, the two number scales on a one-sided protractor often confuse learners when first learning to measure and draw angles. However, in 2009, Jake Adamson, a maths teacher working at Musselburgh Grammar School invented and patented the first two sided protractor trademarked "The Angler". This was a double sided protractor with one scale on each side, avoiding the confusion of having two scales together and enabling easier measuring and drawing of angles. "The Angler" protractor has been widely adopted by schools in the UK.

A '''quantitative analyst''' (or, in financial jargon, a '''quant''') is a person who specializes in the application of mathematical and statistical methods – such as numerical or quantitative techniques – to financial and risk management problems.  The occupation is similar to those in [[industrial mathematics]] in other industries.&lt;ref&gt;See Definition in the Society for Applied and Industrial Mathematics http://www.siam.org/about/pdf/brochure.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the original quantitative analysts were "[[sell side]] quants" from market maker firms, concerned with [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]] pricing and [[risk management]], the meaning of the term has expanded over time to include those individuals involved in almost any application of [[mathematical finance|mathematics in finance]], including the [[buy side]].&lt;ref&gt;Derman, E. (2004). My life as a quant: reflections on physics and finance. John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include [[statistical arbitrage]], quantitative [[investment management]], [[algorithmic trading]],  and electronic market making. 

==History==
[[File:Robert C. Merton.jpg|thumb|[[Robert C. Merton]], one of the pioneers of quantitative analysis, promoted [[stochastic calculus]] into the study of finance.]]
[[Quantitative finance]] started in 1900 with [[Louis Bachelier]]'s doctoral thesis ''Theory of Speculation'', which provided a model to price [[Option (finance)|options]] under a [[Normal Distribution]].

[[Harry Markowitz]]'s 1952 doctoral [[thesis]] "Portfolio Selection" and its published version was one of the first efforts in economics journals to formally adapt mathematical concepts to finance (mathematics was until then confined to mathematics, statistics or specialized economics journals).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Markowitz |first=H. |year=1952 |title=Portfolio Selection |journal=[[Journal of Finance]] |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=77–91 |doi=10.1111/j.1540-6261.1952.tb01525.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Markowitz formalized a notion of mean return and covariances for common stocks which allowed him to quantify the concept of "diversification" in a market. He showed how to compute the mean return and variance for a given portfolio and argued that investors should hold only those portfolios whose variance is minimal among all portfolios with a given mean return.  Although the language of finance now involves [[Itō calculus]], management of risk in a quantifiable manner underlies much of the modern theory.

In 1965 [[Paul Samuelson]] introduced [[stochastic calculus]] into the study of finance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Samuelson |first=P. A. |year=1965 |title=Rational Theory of Warrant Pricing |journal=Industrial Management Review |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=13–32 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Henry McKean]] the co-founder of stochastic calculus (along with [[Kiyosi Itô]]) wrote the appendix: see {{cite journal |last=McKean |first=H. P. Jr. |year=1965 |title=Appendix (to Samuelson): a free boundary problem for the heat equation arising from a problem of mathematical economics |journal=Industrial Management Review |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=32–39 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1969 [[Robert C. Merton|Robert Merton]] promoted continuous stochastic calculus and [[continuous-time]] processes. Merton was motivated by the desire to understand how prices are set in financial markets, which is the classical economics question of "equilibrium," and in later papers he used the machinery of stochastic calculus to begin investigation of this issue.

At the same time as Merton's work and with Merton's assistance, [[Fischer Black]] and [[Myron Scholes]] developed the [[Black–Scholes model]], which was awarded the 1997 [[Nobel Prize in Economics|Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]].  It provided a solution for a practical problem, that of finding a fair price for a European call option, i.e., the right to buy one share of a given stock at a specified price and time.  Such options are frequently purchased by investors as a risk-hedging device. In 1981, Harrison and Pliska used the general theory of continuous-time stochastic processes to put the [[Black–Scholes]] model on a solid theoretical basis, and showed how to price numerous other derivative securities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Harrison |first=J. Michael |last2=Pliska |first2=Stanley R. |title=Martingales and Stochastic Integrals in the Theory of Continuous Trading |journal=Stochastic Processes and their Applications |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=215–260 |year=1981 |doi=10.1016/0304-4149(81)90026-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Emanuel Derman]]'s 2004 book ''My Life as a Quant'' helped to both make the role of a quantitative analyst better known outside of finance, and to popularize the abbreviation "quant" for a quantitative analyst.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Derman |first=Emanuel |year=2004 |title=My Life as a Quant |publisher=John Wiley and Sons }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Quantitative analysts often come from applied mathematics, physics or engineering backgrounds rather than economics-related fields, and quantitative analysis is a major source of employment for people with mathematics and physics PhD degrees, or with financial mathematics [[Diplôme d'études approfondies|DEA]] degrees in the French education system.  Typically, a quantitative analyst will also need extensive skills in computer programming, most commonly [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[R (programming language)|R]], [[MATLAB]], [[Mathematica]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]].

This demand for quantitative analysts has led to a resurgence in demand for [[actuarial]] qualifications as well as creation of specialized Masters and PhD courses in [[financial engineering]], [[mathematical finance]], [[computational finance]], and/or [[financial reinsurance]].  In particular, Master's degrees in [[mathematical finance]], [[financial engineering]], [[operations research]], [[computational statistics]], [[machine Learning|machine learning]], and [[financial analysis]] are becoming more popular with students and with employers. See [[Master of Quantitative Finance]]; [[Master of Financial Economics]].

[[Data science]] and [[machine learning]] analysis and modelling methods are being increasingly employed in portfolio performance and portfolio risk modelling,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marketsmedia.com/machine-learning-in-finance-theory-and-applications/|title=Machine Learning in Finance: Theory and Applications|author=|date=22 January 2013|website=marketsmedia.com|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qminitiative.org/UserFiles/files/S_Cl%C3%A9men%C3%A7on_ML.pdf|title=A Machine-Learning View of Quantitative Finance|author=|date=|website=qminitiative.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as such data science and machine learning Master's graduates are also in demand as quantitative analysts.

==Types==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2010}}

===Front office quantitative analyst===
In sales &amp; trading, quantitative analysts work to determine prices, manage risk, and identify profitable opportunities. Historically this was a distinct activity from trading but the boundary between a desk quantitative analyst and a quantitative trader is increasingly blurred, and it is now difficult to enter trading as a profession without at least some quantitative analysis education. In the field of [[algorithmic trading]] it has reached the point where there is little meaningful difference. Front office work favours a higher speed to quality ratio, with a greater emphasis on solutions to specific problems than detailed modeling. FOQs typically are significantly better paid than those in back office, risk, and model validation. Although highly skilled analysts, FOQs frequently lack software engineering experience or formal training, and bound by time constraints and business pressures tactical solutions are often adopted.

===Quantitative investment management===
Quantitative analysis is used extensively by asset managers. Some, such as FQ, AQR or Barclays, rely almost exclusively on quantitative strategies while others, such as Pimco, Blackrock or Citadel use a mix of quantitative and fundamental methods.

===Library quantitative analysis===
Major firms invest large sums in an attempt to produce standard methods of evaluating prices and risk. These differ from front office tools in that Excel is very rare, with most development being in C++, though Java and C# are sometimes used in non-performance critical tasks. LQs spend more time modeling ensuring the analytics are both efficient and correct, though there is tension between LQs and FOQs on the validity of their results. LQs are required to understand techniques such as [[Monte Carlo methods]] and [[finite difference methods]], as well as the nature of the products being modeled.

===Algorithmic trading quantitative analyst===
Often the highest paid form of Quant, ATQs make use of methods taken from [[signal processing]], [[game theory]], gambling [[Kelly criterion]], [[market microstructure]], [[econometrics]], and [[time series]] analysis. [[Algorithmic trading]] includes [[statistical arbitrage]], but includes techniques largely based upon speed of response, to the extent that some ATQs modify hardware and Linux kernels to achieve ultra low [[Latency (engineering)|latency]].

===Risk management===
This has grown in importance in recent years, as the credit crisis exposed holes in the mechanisms used to ensure that positions were correctly hedged, though in no bank does the pay in risk approach that in front office. A core technique is [[value at risk]], and this is backed up with various forms of [[stress test (financial)]], [[economic capital]] analysis and direct analysis of the positions and models used by various bank's divisions.

===Innovation===
In the aftermath of the financial crisis, there surfaced the recognition that quantitative valuation methods were generally too narrow in their approach. An agreed upon fix adopted by numerous financial institutions has been to improve collaboration.

===Model validation===
Model validation (MV) takes the models and methods developed by front office, library, and modeling quantitative analysts and determines their validity and correctness. The MV group might well be seen as a superset of the quantitative operations in a financial institution, since it must deal with new and advanced models and trading techniques from across the firm. Before the crisis however, the pay structure in all firms was such that MV groups struggle to attract and retain adequate staff, often with talented quantitative analysts leaving at the first opportunity. This gravely impacted corporate ability to manage model risk, or to ensure that the positions being held were correctly valued. An MV quantitative analyst would typically earn a fraction of quantitative analysts in other groups with similar length of experience. In the years following the crisis, this has changed. Regulators now typically talk directly to the quants in the middle office such as the model validators, and since profits highly depend of the regulatory infrastructure, model validation has gained in weight and importance with respect to the quants in the front office.

===Quantitative developer===
Quantitative developers are computer specialists that assist, implement and maintain the quantitative models. They tend to be highly specialised language technicians that bridge the gap between software developer and quantitative analysts.

==Mathematical and statistical approaches==
Because of their backgrounds, quantitative analysts draw from various forms of mathematics: [[statistics]] and [[probability]], [[calculus]] centered around [[partial differential equation]]s, [[linear algebra]], [[discrete mathematics]], and [[econometrics]]. Some on the buy side may use [[machine learning]]. The
majority of quantitative analysts have received little formal education in mainstream economics, and often apply a mindset drawn from the physical sciences. Quants use mathematical skills learned from diverse fields such as computer science, physics and engineering. These skills include (but are not limited to) advanced statistics,  linear algebra and partial differential equations as well as solutions to these based upon [[numerical analysis]].

Commonly used numerical methods are:
* [[Finite difference method]] &amp;ndash; used to solve [[partial differential equation]]s;
* [[Monte Carlo method]] &amp;ndash; Also used to solve [[partial differential equation]]s, but [[Monte Carlo simulation]] is also common in risk management;
* [[Ordinary least squares]] &amp;ndash; used to estimate parameters in [[regression analysis|statistical regression analysis]];
* [[Spline interpolation]] &amp;ndash; used to interpolate values from [[yield curve|spot and forward interest rates curves]], and [[volatility smile]]s;
* [[Bisection method|Bisection]], [[Newton method|Newton]], and [[Secant method]]s &amp;ndash; used to find the [[root of a function|roots]], [[maxima and minima]] of functions (e.g. [[internal rate of return]].)

==Techniques==
A typical problem for a mathematically oriented quantitative analyst would be to develop a model for pricing, hedging, and risk-managing a complex derivative product. These quantitative analysts tend to rely more on numerical analysis than statistics and econometrics. The mindset is to prefer a deterministically "correct" answer, as once there is agreement on input values and market variable dynamics, there is only [[law of one price|one correct price]] for any given security (which can be demonstrated, albeit often inefficiently, through a large volume of Monte Carlo simulations).

A typical problem for a statistically oriented quantitative analyst would be to develop a model for deciding which stocks are relatively expensive and which stocks are relatively cheap. The model might include a company's book value to price ratio, its trailing earnings to price ratio, and other accounting factors. An investment manager might implement this analysis by buying the underpriced stocks, selling the overpriced stocks, or both. Statistically oriented quantitative analysts tend to have more of a reliance on statistics and econometrics, and less of a reliance on sophisticated numerical techniques and object-oriented programming. These quantitative analysts tend to be of the psychology that enjoys trying to find the best approach to modeling data, and can accept that there is no "right answer" until time has passed and we can retrospectively see how the model performed. Both types of quantitative analysts demand a strong knowledge of sophisticated mathematics and computer programming proficiency.

One of the principal mathematical tools of quantitative finance is [[stochastic calculus]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4501">In [[number theory]], a '''symbol''' is any of many different generalizations of the [[Legendre symbol]]. This article describes the relations between these various generalizations.

The symbols below are arranged roughly in order of the date they were introduced, which is usually (but not always) in order of increasing generality.

* [[Legendre symbol]]  &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{a}{p}\right)&lt;/math&gt; defined for ''p'' a prime, ''a'' an integer, and takes values 0, 1, or −1.
* [[Jacobi symbol]] &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{a}{b}\right)&lt;/math&gt; defined for ''b'' a positive odd integer, ''a'' an integer, and takes values 0, 1, or −1. An extension of the Legendre symbol to more general values of ''b''. 
* [[Kronecker symbol]] &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{a}{b}\right)&lt;/math&gt; defined for ''b'' any integer, ''a'' an integer, and takes values 0, 1, or −1. An extension of the Jacobi and Legendre symbols to more general values of ''b''. 
* [[Power residue symbol]] &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{a}{b}\right)=\left(\frac{a}{b}\right)_m&lt;/math&gt; is defined for ''a'' in some global field containing the ''m''th roots of 1 ( for some ''m''), ''b'' a fractional ideal of ''K'' built from prime ideals coprime to ''m''. The symbol takes values in the ''m'' roots of 1. When ''m'' = 2 and the global field is the rationals this is more or less the same as the Jacobi symbol. 
* [[Hilbert symbol]] The local Hilbert symbol (''a'',''b'') = is defined for ''a'' and ''b'' in some local field containing the ''m'' roots of 1 (for some ''m'') and takes values in the ''m'' roots of 1. The power residue symbol can be written in terms of the Hilbert symbol. The global Hilbert symbol  &lt;math&gt;(a,b)_p=\left(\frac{a,b}{p}\right)=\left(\frac{a,b}{p}\right)_m&lt;/math&gt; is defined for ''a'' and ''b'' in some global field ''K'', for ''p'' a finite or infinite place of ''K'', and is equal to the local Hilbert symbol in the completion of ''K'' at the place ''p''.
* [[Artin symbol]] The local Artin symbol or norm residue symbol &lt;math&gt;\theta_{L/K}(\alpha) = (\alpha,L/K) = \left(\frac{L/K}{\alpha}\right)&lt;/math&gt; is defined for ''L'' a finite extension of the local field ''K'', α an element of ''K'', and takes values in the abelianization of the Galois group Gal(''L''/''K''). The global Artin symbol &lt;math&gt;\psi_{L/K}(\alpha) = (\alpha,L/K) = \left(\frac{L/K}{\alpha}\right)=((L/K)/\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; is defined for α in a ray class group or idele (class) group of a global field ''K'', and takes values in the abelianization of Gal(''L''/''K'') for ''L'' an abelian extension of ''K''. When α is in the idele group the symbol is sometimes called a '''Chevalley symbol''' or '''Artin–Chevalley symbol'''. The local Hilbert symbol of ''K'' can be written in terms of the Artin symbol for [[Kummer extension]]s ''L''/''K'', where the roots of unity can be identified with elements of the Galois group. 
*The [[Frobenius symbol]] &lt;math&gt;[(L/K)/P]=\left[\frac{L/K}{P}\right]&lt;/math&gt; is the same as the [[Frobenius element]] of the prime ''P'' of the Galois extension ''L'' of ''K''. 
* "Chevalley symbol" has several slightly different meanings. It is sometimes used for the Artin symbol for ideles. A variation of this is the Chevalley symbol  &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{a,\chi}{p}\right)&lt;/math&gt; for ''p'' a prime ideal of ''K'', ''a'' an element of ''K'', and χ a homomorphism of the Galois group of ''K'' to '''R'''/'''Z'''. The value of the symbol is then the value of the character χ on the usual Artin symbol.  
* [[Norm residue symbol]] This name is for several different closely related symbols, such as the Artin symbol or the Hilbert symbol or Hasse's norm residue symbol. The Hasse norm residue symbol &lt;math&gt;((\alpha,L/K)/p)=\left(\frac{\alpha,L/K}{p}\right)&lt;/math&gt; is defined if ''p'' is a place of ''K'' and α an element of ''K''. It is essentially the same as the local Artin symbol for the localization of ''K'' at ''p''. The Hilbert symbol is a special case of it in the case of Kummer extensions.
* [[Steinberg symbol]] (''a'',''b''). This is a generalization of the local Hilbert symbol to arbitrary fields ''F''. The numbers ''a'' and ''b'' are elements of ''F'', and the symbol (''a'',''b'') takes values in the second K-group of ''F''. 
* [[Galois symbol]] A sort of generalization of the Steinberg symbol to higher algebraic K-theory. It takes a Milnor K-group to an étale cohomology group.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="45664">The tables contain the [[integer factorization|prime factorization]] of the [[natural number]]s from 1 to 1000.

When ''n'' is a [[prime number]], the prime factorization is just ''n'' itself, written in '''bold''' below.

The number [[1 (number)|1]] is called a [[unit (ring theory)|unit]]. It has no [[prime factor]]s and is neither prime nor [[composite number|composite]].

''See also: [[Table of divisors]]'' (prime and non-prime divisors for 1 to 1000)


== Properties ==
Many properties of a natural number ''n'' can be seen or directly computed from the prime factorization of ''n''.
*The '''multiplicity''' of a prime factor ''p'' of ''n'' is the largest exponent ''m'' for which ''p&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;'' divides ''n''. The tables show the multiplicity for each prime factor. If no exponent is written then the multiplicity is 1 (since ''p'' = ''p''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;). The multiplicity of a prime which does not divide ''n'' may be called 0 or may be considered undefined.
*Ω(''n''), the [[Big Omega function (prime factor)|big Omega function]], is the number of prime factors of ''n'' counted with multiplicity (so it is the sum of all prime factor multiplicities).
*A [[prime number]] has Ω(''n'') = 1. The first: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37 {{OEIS|id=A000040}}. There are many special [[List of prime numbers|types of prime numbers]].
*A [[composite number]] has Ω(''n'') &gt; 1. The first: 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 21 {{OEIS|id=A002808}}. All numbers above 1 are either prime or composite. 1 is neither.
*A [[semiprime]] has Ω(''n'') = 2 (so it is composite). The first: 4, 6, 9, 10, 14, 15, 21, 22, 25, 26, 33, 34 {{OEIS|id=A001358}}.
*A ''k''-[[almost prime]] (for a natural number ''k'') has Ω(''n'') = ''k'' (so it is composite if ''k'' &gt; 1).
*An [[even number]] has the prime factor 2. The first: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24 {{OEIS|id=A005843}}.
*An [[odd number]] does not have the prime factor 2. The first: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23 {{OEIS|id=A005408}}. All integers are either even or odd.
*A [[Square number|square]] has even multiplicity for all prime factors (it is of the form ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for some ''a''). The first: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, 144 {{OEIS|id=A000290}}.
*A [[cube (arithmetic)|cube]] has all multiplicities divisible by 3 (it is of the form ''a''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; for some ''a''). The first: 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343, 512, 729, 1000, 1331, 1728 {{OEIS|id=A000578}}.
*A [[perfect power]] has a common divisor ''m'' &gt; 1 for all multiplicities (it is of the form ''a&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt;'' for some ''a'' &gt; 1 and ''m'' &gt; 1). The first: 4, 8, 9, 16, 25, 27, 32, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100 {{OEIS|id=A001597}}. 1 is sometimes included.
*A [[powerful number]] (also called '''squareful''') has multiplicity above 1 for all prime factors. The first: 1, 4, 8, 9, 16, 25, 27, 32, 36, 49, 64, 72 {{OEIS|id=A001694}}.
*A [[prime power]] has only one prime factor. The first: 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 16, 17, 19 {{OEIS|id=A000961}}. 1 is sometimes included.
*An [[Achilles number]] is powerful but not a perfect power. The first: 72, 108, 200, 288, 392, 432, 500, 648, 675, 800, 864, 968 {{OEIS|id=A052486}}.
*A [[square-free integer]] has no prime factor with multiplicity above 1. The first: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17 {{OEIS|id=A005117}}). A number where some but not all prime factors have multiplicity above 1 is neither square-free nor squareful.
*The [[Liouville function]] λ(''n'') is 1 if Ω(''n'') is even, and is -1 if Ω(''n'') is odd.
*The [[Möbius function]] μ(''n'') is 0 if ''n'' is not square-free. Otherwise μ(''n'') is 1 if Ω(''n'') is even, and is −1 if Ω(''n'') is odd.
*A [[sphenic number]] has Ω(''n'') = 3 and is square-free (so it is the product of 3 distinct primes). The first: 30, 42, 66, 70, 78, 102, 105, 110, 114, 130, 138, 154 {{OEIS|id=A007304}}.
*''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') is the sum of primes dividing ''n'', counted with multiplicity. It is an [[additive function]].
*A [[Ruth-Aaron pair]] is two consecutive numbers (''x'', ''x''+1) with ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') = ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''+1). The first (by ''x'' value): 5, 8, 15, 77, 125, 714, 948, 1330, 1520, 1862, 2491, 3248 {{OEIS|id=A039752}}, another definition is the same prime only count once, if so, the first (by ''x'' value): 5, 24, 49, 77, 104, 153, 369, 492, 714, 1682, 2107, 2299 {{OEIS|id=A006145}}
*A [[primorial]] ''x''# is the product of all primes from 2 to ''x''. The first: 2, 6, 30, 210, 2310, 30030, 510510, 9699690, 223092870, 6469693230, 200560490130, 7420738134810 {{OEIS|id=A002110}}. 1# = 1 is sometimes included.
*A [[factorial]] ''x''! is the product of all numbers from 1 to ''x''. The first: 1, 2, 6, 24, 120, 720, 5040, 40320, 362880, 3628800, 39916800, 479001600 {{OEIS|id=A000142}}. 0! = 1 is sometimes included.
*A ''k''-[[smooth number]] (for a natural number ''k'') has largest prime factor ≤ ''k'' (so it is also ''j''-smooth for any ''j'' &gt; k).
*''m'' is '''smoother''' than ''n'' if the largest prime factor of ''m'' is below the largest of ''n''.
*A [[regular number]] has no prime factor above 5 (so it is 5-smooth). The first: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 16 {{OEIS|id=A051037}}.
*A ''k''-[[smooth number#Powersmooth numbers|powersmooth]] number has all ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; ≤ ''k'' where ''p'' is a prime factor with multiplicity ''m''.
*A [[frugal number]] has more digits than the number of digits in its prime factorization (when written like below tables with multiplicities above 1 as exponents). The first in [[decimal]]: 125, 128, 243, 256, 343, 512, 625, 729, 1024, 1029, 1215, 1250 {{OEIS|id=A046759}}.
*An [[equidigital number]] has the same number of digits as its prime factorization. The first in decimal: 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 {{OEIS|id=A046758}}.
*An [[extravagant number]] has fewer digits than its prime factorization. The first in decimal: 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30 {{OEIS|id=A046760}}.
*An '''economical number''' has been defined as a frugal number, but also as a number that is either frugal or equidigital.
*gcd(''m'', ''n'') ([[greatest common divisor]] of ''m'' and ''n'') is the product of all prime factors which are both in ''m'' and ''n'' (with the smallest multiplicity for ''m'' and ''n'').
*''m'' and ''n'' are [[coprime]] (also called relatively prime) if gcd(''m'', ''n'') = 1 (meaning they have no common prime factor).
*lcm(''m'', ''n'') ([[least common multiple]] of ''m'' and ''n'') is the product of all prime factors of ''m'' or ''n'' (with the largest multiplicity for ''m'' or ''n'').
*gcd(''m'', ''n'') × lcm(''m'', ''n'') = ''m'' × ''n''. Finding the prime factors is often harder than to compute gcd and lcm with other algorithms which do not require known prime factorization.
*''m'' is a [[divisor]] of ''n'' (also called ''m'' divides ''n'', or ''n'' is divisible by ''m'') if all prime factors of ''m'' have at least the same multiplicity in ''n''.
The divisors of ''n'' are all products of some or all prime factors of ''n'' (including the empty product 1 of no prime factors).
The number of divisors can be computed by increasing all multiplicities by 1 and then multiplying them.
Divisors and properties related to divisors are shown in [[table of divisors]].

The '''theta model''', or '''Ermentrout–Kopell [[canonical form|canonical]] model''', is a [[biological neuron model]] originally developed to model neurons in the animal [[Aplysia]], and later used in various fields of [[computational neuroscience]].  The model is particularly well suited to describe neuron [[bursting]], which are rapid oscillations in the [[membrane potential]] of a neuron interrupted by periods of relatively little oscillation.  Bursts are often found in [[neurons]] responsible for controlling and maintaining steady rhythms.  For example, breathing is controlled by a small network of bursting neurons in the brain stem.   Of the three main classes of bursting [[neurons]] ([[Bursting#Square-wave burster|square wave bursting]], [[parabolic bursting]], and [[elliptic bursting]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lee |title=Stability Analysis Of Bursting Models |journal=Journal of the Korean Mathematical Society |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=827–45 |year=2005 |doi=10.4134/jkms.2005.42.4.827}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Vries G. De. |title=Multiple Bifurcations in a Polynomial Model of Bursting Oscillations |journal=Journal of Nonlinear Science |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=281–316 |year=1998 |doi=10.1007/s003329900053}}&lt;/ref&gt; the theta model describes [[parabolic bursting]]. [[Parabolic bursting]] is characterized by a series of bursts that are regulated by a slower external oscillation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ermentrout B, Kopell, N |title=Parabolic bursting in an [[excitable system]] coupled with a slow oscillation |journal=SIAM Journal of Applied Mathematics | volume=46 |pages=233–253 |year=1986 |doi=10.1137/0146017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This slow oscillation changes the frequency of the faster oscillation so that the frequency curve of the burst pattern resembles a parabola.

The model has just one [[state variable]] which describes the membrane voltage of a neuron. In contrast, the [[Hodgkin–Huxley model]] consists of four state variables (one voltage variable and three gating variables) and the  [[Morris–Lecar model]] is defined by two state variables (one voltage variable and one gating variable).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Ermentrout B, Terman DH |title=Mathematical Foundations of Neuroscience |publisher=Springer |location=New York |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-387-87707-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The single [[state variable]] of the theta model, and the elegantly simple [[equations]] that govern its behavior allow for [[analytical expression|analytic]], or [[Closed-form expression|closed-form]] solutions (including an explicit expression for the [[phase response curve]]).  The [[dynamical system|dynamics]] of the model take place on the [[unit circle]], and are governed by two [[cosine]] functions and a real-valued input [[function (mathematics)|function]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ermentrout B, Kopell, N |title=Parabolic bursting in an excitable system coupled with a slow oscillation |journal=SIAM Journal of Applied Mathematics | volume=46 |pages=233–253 |year=1986 |doi=10.1137/0146017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar models include the [[quadratic integrate and fire]] (QIF) model, which differs from the theta model by only by a [[change of variables]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brunel, Nicolas, Latham |title=Firing Rate of the Noisy Quadratic Integrate-and-Fire Neuron |journal=Neural Computation | volume=15 | issue=10 |pages=2281–306 |year=2003 |doi=10.1162/089976603322362365}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ermentrout B. |title=Ermentrout–Kopell Canonical Model |journal=Scholarpedia | volume=3 | issue=3 |pages=1398 |year=2008 |doi=10.4249/scholarpedia.1398}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gielen, Stan, Krupa, Zeitler |title=Gamma Oscillations as a Mechanism for Selective Information Transmission |journal=Biological Cybernetics | volume=103 | issue=2 |pages=151–65 |year=2010 |doi=10.1007/s00422-010-0390-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Latham, P.

==Background and history==
[[File:pbc burst.png|left|thumb|250px|A model of [[pre-Bötzinger complex]] (pBC) [[neuron]].  The pre-Bötzinger complex is a region in the [[brain stem]] responsible for maintaining breathing rhythms. This is an example of a [[square-wave burster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lee |title=Stability Analysis Of Bursting Models |journal=Journal of the Korean Mathematical Society |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=827–45 |year=2005 |doi=10.4134/jkms.2005.42.4.827}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a slice preparation of the pBC complex, the neurons burst periodically and synchronize as long as they receive a continual, external, noisy input.]]

Bursting is "an oscillation in which an observable [part] of the system, such as [[voltage]] or [[chemical concentration]], changes periodically between an active phase of rapid [[action potential|spike]] oscillations (the fast sub-system) and a phase of quiescence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bertram, R., M. Butte, T. Kiemel, and A.

All three forms of bursting are capable of beating and periodic bursting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Plant, R.

Since many biological processes involve bursting behavior, there is a wealth of various bursting models in scientific literature.  For instance, there exist several models for [[interneurons]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Erisir, A., D. Lau, B. Rudy, and S. Leonard |title=Function of Specific K+ Channels in Sustained High-frequency Firing of Fast-spiking Neocortical Cells |journal=J.

Parabolic bursting models are [[mathematical models]] that mimic parabolic bursting in real biological systems.  Each [[bursting|burst]] of a [[parabolic burster]] has a characteristic feature in the burst structure itself – the frequency at the beginning and end of the burst is low relative to the frequency in the middle of the burst.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lee |title=Stability Analysis Of Bursting Models |journal=Journal of the Korean Mathematical Society |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=827–45 |year=2005 |doi=10.4134/jkms.2005.42.4.827}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[frequency]] plot of one burst resembles a [[parabola]], hence the name "parabolic burst".  Furthermore, unlike elliptic or square-wave bursting, there is a slow modulating wave which, at its peak, excites the cell enough to generate a burst and inhibits the cell in regions near its minimum.  As a result, the neuron periodically transitions between bursting and quiescence.

Parabolic bursting has been studied most extensively in the R15 neuron, which is one of six types of neurons of the ''Aplysia'' abdominal ganglion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Faber D, Klee M |title=Membrane Characteristics of Bursting Pacemaker Neurons in Aplysia |journal=Nature New Biology |volume=240 |pages=29–31 |year=1972 |doi=10.1038/newbio240029a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of thirty neurons comprising the [[abdominal ganglion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kandel, E.

Early attempts to model parabolic bursting were for specific applications, often related to studies of the R15 neuron.  This is especially true of R. E. Plant&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Plant, R. Kim, M. |title=Mathematical Description of a Bursting Pacemaker Neuron by a Modification of the Hodgkin–Huxley Equations |journal=Biophysical Journal | volume=16 | issue=3 |pages=227–44 |year=1976 |doi=10.1016/s0006-3495(76)85683-4 |pmid=1252578 |pmc=1334834}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Plant, R. |title=The Effects of Calcium++ on Bursting Neurons.

Though there was no specific mention of the term "parabolic bursting" in Plant's papers, [http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Plant_model Plant's model(s)] do involve a slow, modulating oscillation which control bursting in the model(s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Plant, R. Kim, M. |title=Mathematical Description of a Bursting Pacemaker Neuron by a Modification of the Hodgkin–Huxley Equations |journal=Biophysical Journal | volume=16 | issue=3 |pages=227–44 |year=1976 |doi=10.1016/s0006-3495(76)85683-4 |pmid=1252578 |pmc=1334834}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Plant, R. |title=The Effects of Calcium++ on Bursting Neurons.

Both of Plant's papers on the topic involve a model derived from the [[Hodgkin–Huxley equations]] and include extra conductances, which only add to the complexity of the model.

Carpenter developed her model primarily for a square wave burster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Carpenter, Gail A. |title=Bursting Phenomena in Excitable Membranes |journal=SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics | volume=36 | issue=2 |pages=334–372 |year=1979 |doi=10.1137/0136027}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The model was capable of producing a small variety of square wave bursts and produced parabolic bursts as a consequence of adding an extra [[Electrical conductance|conductance]].  However, the model applied to only spatial propagation down [[axons]] and not situations where oscillations are limited to a small region in space (i.e. it was not suited for "space-clamped" situations).

The lack of a simple, generalizable, space-clamped, parabolic bursting model motivated Ermentrout and Kopell to develop the theta model.

==Characteristics of the model==

===General equations===
It is possible to describe a multitude of parabolic bursting cells by deriving a simple mathematical model, called a canonical model.  Derivation of the Ermentrout and Kopell canonical model begins with the general form for parabolic bursting, and notation will be fixed to clarify the discussion.  The letters &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; are reserved for functions; &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; for state variables; &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; for [[Scalar (mathematics)|scalars]].

In the following generalized system of equations for parabolic bursting, the values of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; describe the membrane potential and ion channels, typical of many [http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Conductance-based_models conductance-based] biological neuron models.  Slow oscillations are controlled by &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt;, and ultimately described by &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;.  These slow oscillations can be, for example, slow fluctuations in calcium concentration inside a cell.  The function &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; couples &lt;math&gt;\dot{y}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\dot{x}&lt;/math&gt;, thereby allowing  the second system, &lt;math&gt;\dot{y}&lt;/math&gt;, to influence the behavior of the first system, &lt;math&gt;\dot{x}&lt;/math&gt;.  In more succinct terms, "&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; generates the spikes and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; generates the slow waves".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ermentrout B, Kopell, N |title=Parabolic bursting in an excitable system coupled with a slow oscillation |journal=SIAM Journal of Applied Mathematics | volume=46 |pages=233–253 |year=1986 |doi=10.1137/0146017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The equations are:

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{x} = f(x) + \varepsilon^2 g(x,y,\varepsilon),&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{y} = \varepsilon h(x,y,\varepsilon),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is a vector with &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; entries (i.e. &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathbb{R}^p&lt;/math&gt;), &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is a vector with &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; entries (i.e. &lt;math&gt;y \in \mathbb{R}^q&lt;/math&gt;), &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; is small and positive, and &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; are [[Smooth function|smooth]] (i.e. infinitely differentiable).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ermentrout B, Kopell, N |title=Parabolic bursting in an excitable system coupled with a slow oscillation |journal=SIAM Journal of Applied Mathematics | volume=46 |pages=233–253 |year=1986 |doi=10.1137/0146017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additional constraints are required to guarantee parabolic bursting.  First, &lt;math&gt;\dot{x}=f(x)&lt;/math&gt; must produce a circle in [[phase space]] that is [[Invariant (mathematics)|invariant]], meaning it does not change under certain [[Transformation (function)|transformations]].  This circle must also be [[Attractor|attracting]] in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt; with a [[Critical point (mathematics)|critical point]] located at &lt;math&gt;x = 0&lt;/math&gt;.  The second criterion requires that when &lt;math&gt;\dot{y}=h(0,y,0)&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a stable [[limit cycle]] solution.  These criteria can be summarized by the following points:

#When &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon = 0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\dot{x}=f(x)&lt;/math&gt; "has an attracting invariant circle with a single critical point", with the critical point located at &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt;, and
#When &lt;math&gt;x = 0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\dot{y}=h(0,y,0)&lt;/math&gt; has a stable limit cycle solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ermentrout B, Kopell, N |title=Parabolic bursting in an excitable system coupled with a slow oscillation |journal=SIAM Journal of Applied Mathematics | volume=46 |pages=233–253 |year=1986 |doi=10.1137/0146017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theta model can be used in place of any parabolic bursting model that satisfies the assumptions above.

=== Model equations and properties ===

The theta model is a reduction of the generalized system from the previous section and takes the form,

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{d\theta}{dt}=1-\cos\theta+(1+\cos\theta)I(t), \qquad \theta \in S^1.&lt;/math&gt;

This model is one of the simplest excitable neuron models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=McKennoch, S., Voegtlin T., and Bushnell L. |title=Spike-Timing Error Backpropagation in Theta Neuron Networks |journal=Neural Computation | volume=21 | issue=1 |pages=9–45| doi=10.1162/neco.2009.09-07-610 |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The state variable &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; represents the angle in [[radian]]s, and the input function, &lt;math&gt;I(t)&lt;/math&gt;, is typically chosen to be [[Periodic function|periodic]].  Whenever &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; reaches the value &lt;math&gt;\theta = \pi&lt;/math&gt;, the model is said to produce a spike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ermentrout B. |title=Ermentrout–Kopell Canonical Model |journal=Scholarpedia | volume=3 | issue=3 |pages=1398 |year=2008 |doi=10.4249/scholarpedia.1398}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=McKennoch, S., Voegtlin T., and Bushnell L. |title=Spike-Timing Error Backpropagation in Theta Neuron Networks |journal=Neural Computation | volume=21 | issue=1 |pages=9–45| doi=10.1162/neco.2009.09-07-610 |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theta model is capable of a single [[Saddle-node bifurcation|saddle-node]] [[Bifurcation theory|bifurcation]] and can be shown to be the "[[Normal form (mathematics)|normal form]] for the saddle-node on a limit cycle bifurcation" ([http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Saddle-node_bifurcation_on_invariant_circle SNIC]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ermentrout B. |title=Ermentrout-Kopell Canonical Model |journal=Scholarpedia | volume=3 | issue=3 |pages=1398 |year=2008 |doi=10.4249/scholarpedia.1398}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When &lt;math&gt;(I &lt; 0)&lt;/math&gt;, the system is excitable, i.e., given an appriate [[Perturbation (biology)|perturbation]] the system will produce a spike. Incidentally, when viewed in the [[plane (geometry)|plane]] (&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt;), the [[unstable]] critical point is actually a [[saddle point]] because &lt;math&gt;S^1&lt;/math&gt; is attracting in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt;.  When &lt;math&gt;(I &gt; 0)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\dot{\theta}&lt;/math&gt; is also positive, and the system will give rise to a limit cycle.   Therefore, the bifurcation point is located at &lt;math&gt;I(t) = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

Near the bifurcation point, the theta model resembles the [[quadratic integrate and fire]] model:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{dx}{dt} = x^2 + I.&lt;/math&gt;

For I &gt; 0, the solutions "blow up" rather quickly.  By resetting the trajectory &lt;math&gt;x(t) &lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt; when it reaches &lt;math&gt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt;, the total period is then

: &lt;math&gt;T = \frac{\pi}{\sqrt{I}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the period diverges as &lt;math&gt;I \rightarrow 0^+&lt;/math&gt; and the frequency converges to zero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ermentrout B. |title=Ermentrout–Kopell Canonical Model |journal=Scholarpedia | volume=3 | issue=3 |pages=1398 |year=2008 |doi=10.4249/scholarpedia.1398}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Example====
When &lt;math&gt;I(t)&lt;/math&gt; is some slow wave which can be both negative and positive, the system is capable of producing parabolic bursts.  Consider the simple example &lt;math&gt;I(t) := \sin(\alpha t)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is relatively small.  Then for &lt;math&gt;\alpha t \in (0, \pi)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;I(t)&lt;/math&gt; is strictly positive and &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; makes multiple passes through the angle &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;, resulting in multiple bursts.   Note that whenever &lt;math&gt;\alpha t&lt;/math&gt; is near zero or &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;, the theta neuron will spike at relatively a low frequency, and whenever &lt;math&gt;\alpha t&lt;/math&gt; is near &lt;math&gt;\alpha t = \pi/2&lt;/math&gt; the neuron will spike with very high frequency. When &lt;math&gt;\alpha t = \pi&lt;/math&gt;, the frequency of spikes is zero since the period is infinite since &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; can no longer pass through &lt;math&gt;\theta = \pi&lt;/math&gt;. Finally, for &lt;math&gt;\alpha t \in (\pi, 2\pi)&lt;/math&gt;, the neuron is excitable and will no longer burst.  This qualitative description highlights the characteristics that make the theta model a parabolic bursting model.  Not only does the model have periods of quiescence between bursts which are modulated by a slow wave, but the frequency of spikes at the beginning and end of each burst is high relative to the frequency at the middle of the burst.

===Derivation===
The derivation comes in the form of two [[Lemma (mathematics)|lemmas]] in Ermentrout and Kopell (1986).  Lemma 1, in summary, states that when viewing the general equations above in a subset &lt;math&gt;S^1 \times \mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt;, the equations take the form:

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{x_1} = \overline{f}(x_1) + \varepsilon^2 \overline{g}(x_1, y, \varepsilon) \qquad x_1 \in S^1,&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{y} = \varepsilon \overline{h}(x_1, y, \varepsilon) \;\;\;\;\;\; y \in \mathbb{R}^q.&lt;/math&gt;

By lemma 2 in Ermentrout and Kopell 1986, "There exists a change of coordinates... and a constant, c, such that in new coordinates, the two equations above [[Pointwise convergence|converge pointwise]] as &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon \rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt; to the equations

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{\theta} = (1-\cos\theta) + (1 + \cos\theta)\overline{g}(0,y,0),&lt;/math&gt;
 
: &lt;math&gt;\dot{y} = \frac{1}{c} \overline{h}(0,y,0),&lt;/math&gt;

for all &lt;math&gt;\theta \neq \pi&lt;/math&gt;.  Convergence is [[Uniform convergence|uniform]] except near &lt;math&gt;\theta = \pi&lt;/math&gt;." (Ermentrout and Kopell, 1986).  By letting &lt;math&gt;I(t) := \overline{g}(0,y,0)&lt;/math&gt;, resemblance to the theta model is obvious.

===Phase response curve===
[[File:theta-prc.png|right|thumb|250px|The phase response curve of the theta model with K = 1. Since perturbations always result in a phase advance, this is a type 1 PRC.]]

In general, given a scalar phase model of the form

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{\theta} = f(\theta) + g(\theta)S(t),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;S(t)&lt;/math&gt; represents the perturbation current, a closed form solution of the [[phase response curve]] (PRC) does not exist.

However, the theta model is a special case of such an oscillator and happens to have a closed-form solution for the PRC.  The theta model is recovered by defining &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; as

: &lt;math&gt;f(\theta) = (1-\cos\theta) + I(1+\cos\theta),&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;g(\theta) = (1 + \cos\theta).&lt;/math&gt;

In the appendix of Ermentrout 1996, the PRC is shown to be &lt;math&gt;Z(\theta) = K(1+\cos\theta)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ermentrout, B. |title=Type I Membranes, Phase Resetting Curves, and Synchrony |journal=Neural Computation | volume=8 | issue=5 |pages=979–1001| year=1996 | doi=10.1162/neco.1996.8.5.979 | pmid=8697231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar models==

===Plant's model===
The authors of Soto-Treviño et al. (1996) discuss in great detail the similarities between Plant's (1976) model and the theta model.  At first glance, the mechanisms of bursting in both systems are very different:  In Plant's model, there are two slow oscillations – one for conductance of a specific current and one for the concentration of calcium.  The calcium oscillations are active only when the membrane potential is capable of oscillating.  This contrasts heavily against the theta model in which one slow wave modulates the burst of the neuron and the slow wave has no dependence upon the bursts.  Despite these differences, the theta model is shown to be similar to Plant's (1976) model by a series of coordinate transformations. In the process, Soto-Trevino, et al. discovered that the theta model was more general than originally believed.

===Quadratic integrate-and-fire===

The quadratic integrate-and-fire (QIF) model was created by Latham et al. in 2000 to explore the many questions related to networks of neurons with low firing rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Latham, P. E., B. J. Richmond, P. G. Nelson, and S. Nirenberg. |title=Intrinsic Dynamics in Neuronal Networks. I. Theory. |journal=Journal of Neurophysiology | volume=88 | issue=2 |pages=808–27 |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was unclear to Latham et al. why networks of neurons with "standard" parameters were unable to generate sustained low frequency firing rates, while networks with low firing rates were often seen in biological systems.

According to Gerstner and Kistler (2002), the [http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Quadratic_integrate_and_fire_neuron quadratic integrate-and-fire (QIF) model] is given by the following differential equation:

: &lt;math&gt;\tau \dot{u} = a_0(u-u_\text{rest})(u-u_c) + R_m I,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;a_0&lt;/math&gt; is a strictly positive scalar, &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is the membrane potential, &lt;math&gt;u_\text{rest}&lt;/math&gt; is the resting potential &lt;math&gt;u_c&lt;/math&gt; is the minimum potential necessary for the membrane to produce an action potential, &lt;math&gt;R_m&lt;/math&gt; is the membrane resistance, &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; the membrane time constant and &lt;math&gt;u_c &gt; u_\text{rest}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Spiking Neuron Models. Single Neurons, Populations, Plasticity |author1=W. Gerstner  |author2=W. Kistler  |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=2002  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  When there is no input current (i.e. &lt;math&gt;I = 0&lt;/math&gt;), the membrane potential quickly returns to rest following a perturbation.  When the input current, &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;, is large enough, the membrane potential (&lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;) surpasses its firing threshold and rises rapidly (indeed, it reaches arbitrarily large values in finite time); this represents the peak of the action potential.  To simulate the recovery after the action potential, the membrane voltage is then reset to a lower value &lt;math&gt;u_r&lt;/math&gt;.  To avoid dealing with arbitrarily large values in simulation, researchers will often set an upper limit on the membrane potential, above which the membrane potential will be reset; for example Latham et al. (2000) reset the voltage from +20&amp;nbsp;mV to −80&amp;nbsp;mV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Latham, P. E., B. J. Richmond, P. G. Nelson, and S. Nirenberg. |title=Intrinsic Dynamics in Neuronal Networks. I. Theory. |journal=Journal of Neurophysiology | volume=88 | issue=2 |pages=808–27 |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This voltage reset constitutes an action potential.

The theta model is very similar to the QIF model since the theta model differs from the QIF model by means of a simple coordinate transform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brunel, Nicolas, Latham |title=Firing Rate of the Noisy Quadratic Integrate-and-Fire Neuron |journal=Neural Computation | volume=15 | issue=10 |pages=2281–306 |year=2003 |doi=10.1162/089976603322362365}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Latham, P. E., B. J. Richmond, P. G. Nelson, and S. Nirenberg. |title=Intrinsic Dynamics in Neuronal Networks. I. Theory. |journal=Journal of Neurophysiology | volume=88 | issue=2 |pages=808–27 |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By scaling the voltage appropriately and letting &lt;math&gt;\Delta I&lt;/math&gt; be the change in current from the minimum current required to elicit a spike, the QIF model can be rewritten in the form

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{u} = u^2 + \Delta I.&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, the theta model can be rewritten as

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{\theta} = 1-\cos\theta +  (1+\cos\theta) \Delta I.&lt;/math&gt;

The following proof will show that the QIF model becomes the theta model given an appropriate choice for the coordinate transform.

Define &lt;math&gt;u(t) = \tan(\theta/2)&lt;/math&gt;.  Recall that &lt;math&gt;d\tan(x)/dx = 1/\cos^2(x)&lt;/math&gt;, so taking the derivative yields

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{u} = \frac 1 {\cos^2\left(\frac \theta 2\right)} \frac 1 2 \dot{\theta} = u^2 + \Delta I.&lt;/math&gt;

An additional substitution and rearranging in terms of &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; yields

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{\theta} = 2\left[ \cos^2\left(\frac\theta2\right)\tan^2 \left(\frac\theta2\right) + \cos^2\left(\frac\theta2\right)\Delta I \right] = 2\left[ \sin^2 \left(\frac \theta 2\right) + \cos^2 \left ( \frac \theta 2\right)\Delta I \right].&lt;/math&gt;

Using the trigonometric identities &lt;math&gt;\cos^2(x/2) = \frac{1+\cos(x)}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\sin^2(x/2) = \frac{1-\cos(x)}{2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\dot{\theta}&lt;/math&gt; as defined above, we have that

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{\theta} = 2 \left[ \frac{1-\cos\theta} 2 + \left(\frac{1+\cos\theta}{2}\right) \Delta I \right] = 1-\cos\theta + (1+\cos\theta)\Delta I.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, there exists a change of coordinates, namely &lt;math&gt;u(t) = \tan(\theta/2)&lt;/math&gt;, which transforms the QIF model into the theta model.  The reverse transformation also exists, and is attained by taking the inverse of the first transformation.

==Applications==

===Neuroscience===

====Lobster stomatogastric ganglion====
Though the theta model was originally used to model slow cytoplasmic oscillations that modulate fast membrane oscillations in a single cell, Ermentrout and Kopell found that the theta model could be applied just as easily to systems of two electrically coupled cells such that the slow oscillations of one cell modulates the bursts of the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ermentrout B, Kopell, N |title=Parabolic bursting in an excitable system coupled with a slow oscillation |journal=SIAM Journal of Applied Mathematics | volume=46 |pages=233–253 |year=1986 |doi=10.1137/0146017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such cells serve as the central pattern generator (CPG) of the [[Pylorus|pyloric]] system in the lobster stomatograstic ganglion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Marder, E.  |author2=Eisen,  J. S.  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Transmitter identification of pyloric neurons: electrically coupled neurons use different neurotransmitters |journal=J. Neurophysiol. |year=1984a}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In such a system, a slow oscillator, called the anterior burster (AB) cell, modulates the  bursting cell called the pyloric dilator (PD), resulting in parabolic bursts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ermentrout B, Kopell, N |title=Parabolic bursting in an excitable system coupled with a slow oscillation |journal=SIAM Journal of Applied Mathematics | volume=46 |pages=233–253 |year=1986 |doi=10.1137/0146017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Visual cortex====
A group led by Boergers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Börgers C. |author2=Epstein S. |author3=Kopell N.  |last-author-amp=yes |title=Gamma Oscillations Mediate Stimulus Competition and Attentional Selection in a Cortical Network Model|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume=105 | issue=46 |pages=18023–18028 |year=2008 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0809511105 |pmid=19004759 |pmc=2584712}}&lt;/ref&gt; used the theta model to explain why exposure to multiple simultaneous stimuli can reduce the response of the visual cortex below the normal response from a single (preferred) stimulus. Their computational results showed that this may happen due to strong stimulation of a large group of inhibitory neurons. This effect not only inhibits neighboring populations, but has the extra consequence of leaving the inhibitory neurons in disarray, thus increasing the effectiveness of inhibition.

===Theta networks===
Osan et al. (2002) found that in a network of theta neurons, there exist two different types of waves that propagate smoothly over the network, given a sufficiently large coupling strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Osan R. |author2=Rubin J. |author3=Ermentrout B.  |last-author-amp=yes |title=Regular Traveling Waves in a One-Dimensional Network of Theta Neurons |journal=SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics | volume=62 | issue=4 |pages=1197–1221 |year=2002 |doi=10.1137/s0036139901387253|citeseerx=10.1.1.83.2413 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such traveling waves are of interest because they are frequently observed in pharmacologically treated brain slices, but are hard to measure in intact animals brains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Osan R. |author2=Rubin J. |author3=Ermentrout B.  |last-author-amp=yes |title=Regular Traveling Waves in a One-Dimensional Network of Theta Neurons |journal=SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics | volume=62 | issue=4 |pages=1197–1221 |year=2002 |doi=10.1137/s0036139901387253|citeseerx=10.1.1.83.2413 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The authors used a network of theta models in favor of a network of leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) models due to two primary advantages: first, the theta model is continuous, and second, the theta model retains information about "the delay between the crossing of the spiking threshold and the actual firing of an action potential".  The LIF fails to satisfy both conditions.

===Artificial intelligence===

====Steepest gradient descent learning rule====
The theta model can also be applied to research beyond the realm of biology. McKennoch et al. (2008) derived a steepest [[gradient descent]] [[Association rule learning|learning rule]] based on theta neuron dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=McKennoch, S., Voegtlin T., and Bushnell L. |title=Spike-Timing Error Backpropagation in Theta Neuron Networks |journal=Neural Computation | volume=21 | issue=1 |pages=9–45| doi=10.1162/neco.2009.09-07-610 |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their model is based on the assumption that "intrinsic neuron dynamics are sufficient to achieve consistent time coding, with no need to involve the precise shape of postsynaptic currents..."  contrary to similar models like SpikeProp and [[Tempotron]], which depend heavily on the shape of the [[postsynaptic potential]] (PSP).  Not only could the multilayer theta network perform just about as well as Tempotron learning, but the rule trained the multilayer theta network to perform certain tasks neither SpikeProp nor Tempotron were capable of.

==Limitations==
According to Kopell and Ermentrout (2004), a limitation of the theta lies in its relative difficulty in electrically coupling two theta neurons.  It is possible to create large networks of theta neurons – and much research has been done with such networks – but it may be advantageous to use Quadratic Integrate-and-Fire (QIF) neurons, which allow for electrical coupling in a "straightforward way".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kopell N.  |author2=Ermentrout B.  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Chemical and Electrical Synapses Perform Complementary Roles in the Synchronization of Interneuronal Networks |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=101 |issue=43 |pages=15482–5487 |year=2004 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0406343101 |pmid=15489269 |pmc=524455}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1759: French mathematician [[Émilie du Châtelet]]'s translation and commentary on Isaac Newton's work ''Principia Mathematica'' was published posthumously; it is still considered the standard French translation.&lt;ref name="brooklynmuseum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/eascfa/dinner_party/heritage_floor/emilie_du_chatelet.php|title=Brooklyn Museum: Elizabeth A.

1827: French mathematician [[Sophie Germain]] saw her theorem, known as [[Sophie Germain's theorem|Germain's Theorem]], published in a footnote of a book by the mathematician [[Adrien-Marie Legendre]].&lt;ref name="agnesscott.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agnesscott.edu/lriddle/women/germain.htm|title=Sophie Germain|publisher=agnesscott.edu|accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rochester"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.rochester.edu/people/faculty/doug/UGpages/sophie.html|title=Sophie Germain page|publisher=math.rochester.edu|accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this theorem Germain proved that if ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' are integers and if ''x''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''z''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; then either ''x'', ''y'', or ''z'' must be divisible by&amp;nbsp;5.

1874: Russian mathematician [[Sofia Kovalevskaya]] became the first woman in modern Europe to gain a doctorate in mathematics, which she earned from the [[University of Göttingen]] in Germany.&lt;ref name="britannica.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/323006/Sofya-Vasilyevna-Kovalevskaya|title=Sofya Vasilyevna Kovalevskaya (Russian mathematician) -- Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=britannica.com|accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

1880: [[Charlotte Angas Scott]] of Britain obtained special permission to take the [[Cambridge Mathematical Tripos]] Exam, as women were not normally allowed to sit for the exam. She came eighth on the Tripos of all students taking them, but due to her sex, the title of "eighth [[Wrangler (University of Cambridge)|wrangler]]," a high honour, went officially to a male student.&lt;ref name=kenschaft&gt;{{cite book|title="Charlotte Angas Scott (1858–1931)" in Women of Mathematics: A Biobibliographic Sourcebook|year=1987|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=New York|isbn=0-313-24849-4|pages=193–203|author=Patricia Clark Kenschaft|authorlink=Patricia Clark Kenschaft}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the ceremony, however, after the seventh wrangler had been announced, all the students in the audience shouted her name. Because she could not attend the award ceremony, Scott celebrated her accomplishment at Girton College where there were cheers and clapping at dinner, and a special evening ceremony where the students sang "See the Conquering Hero Comes", and she received an ode written by a staff member, and was crowned with laurels.&lt;ref name=kenschaft /&gt; 

1886: [[Winifred Edgerton Merrill]] became the first American woman to earn a PhD in mathematics, which she earned from Columbia University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ams.org/notices/201204/rtx120400504p.pdf |title=Winifred Edgerton Merrill : "She Opened the Door" |publisher=Ams.org |accessdate=2014-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1913: American mathematician [[Mildred Sanderson]] published her theorem about modular invariants in her thesis. It states: “To any modular invariant i of a system of forms under any group G of linear transformations with coefficients in the GF[pn], there corresponds a formal invariant I under G such that I = i for all sets of values in the field of the coefficients of the system of forms.” She was [[Leonard Dickson]]’s first female graduate student, and he later wrote of her thesis, “This paper is a highly important contribution to this field of work; its importance lies partly in the fact that it establishes a correspondence between modular and formal invariants. Her main theorem has already been frequently quoted on account of its fundamental character. Her proof is a remarkable piece of mathematics.” [[E.T. Bell]] wrote, “Miss Sanderson’s single contribution (1913) to modular invariants has been rated by competent judges as one of the classics of the subject.”&lt;ref name="agnesscott2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agnesscott.edu/lriddle/women/sander.htm|title=Mildred Leonora Sanderson|publisher=agnesscott.edu|accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1930s: British mathematician [[Mary Cartwright]] proved her theorem, now known as [[Cartwright's theorem]], which gives an estimate for the maximum modulus of an analytic function that takes the same value no more than p times in the unit disc. To prove the theorem she used a new approach, applying a technique introduced by [[Lars Ahlfors]] for conformal mappings.&lt;ref name="st-and"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Cartwright.html|title=Cartwright biography|publisher=-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk|accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1065">{{unreferenced|date=October 2017}}In [[mathematics]], a '''toy theorem''' is a simplified version ([[special case]]) of a more general [[theorem]]. For instance, by introducing some simplifying assumptions in a theorem, one obtains a toy theorem.

Usually, a toy theorem is used to illustrate the claim of a theorem. It can also be insightful to study proofs of a toy theorem derived from a non-trivial theorem. Toy theorems can also have education value. After presenting a theorem (with, say, a highly non-trivial proof), one can sometimes give some assurance that the theorem really holds, by proving a toy version of the theorem.

For instance, a toy theorem of the [[Brouwer fixed-point theorem]] is obtained by restricting the [[dimension]] to one. In this case, the Brouwer fixed-point theorem follows almost immediately from the [[intermediate value theorem]].

The concept of a '''Turing pattern''' (often referred to in the plural as '''Turing patterns''') was introduced by the English mathematician [[Alan Turing]] in a 1952 paper entitled ''[[The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Turing | first1=A. M. | authorlink=Alan Turing | title=The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis | journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London]] B | volume=237 | issue=641 | pages=37–72 | doi=10.1098/rstb.1952.0012 | url=http://www.dna.caltech.edu/courses/cs191/paperscs191/turing.pdf | jstor=92463 | year=1952 | bibcode=1952RSPTB.237...37T }}&lt;/ref&gt; This foundational paper describes the way in which [[patterns in nature]] such as stripes and spots can arise naturally out of a homogeneous, uniform state.

The original theory, a [[Reaction–diffusion system|reaction–diffusion]] theory of [[morphogenesis]], has served as an important model in [[theoretical biology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=L. G. | last=Harrison | title=Kinetic Theory of Living Pattern | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | year=1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reaction–diffusion system]]s have attracted much interest as a prototype model for [[pattern formation]]. Patterns such as [[Front (physics)|fronts]], [[hexagon]]s, [[spiral]]s, [[Stripe (pattern)|stripes]] and [[dissipative soliton]]s are found in various types of reaction-diffusion systems, despite large discrepancies, in the local reaction terms for example.

As well as in biological organisms, Turing patterns occur in other natural systems – for example, the wind patterns formed in sand. Although Turing's ideas on morphogenesis and Turing patterns remained dormant for many years, they are now inspirational for much research in [[mathematical biology]].&lt;ref&gt;Woolley, T.

In [[computational science]], '''wildfire modeling''' is concerned with [[numerical weather prediction|numerical simulation]] of [[wildland fire]]s in order to understand and predict fire behavior. Wildfire modeling can ultimately aid [[wildland fire suppression]], namely increase safety of [[firefighter]]s and the public, reduce risk, and minimize damage. Wildfire modeling can also aid in protecting [[ecosystem]]s, [[Drainage basin|watershed]]s, and [[air quality]].

==Objectives of wildfire modeling==

Wildfire modeling attempts to reproduce fire behavior, such as how quickly the fire spreads, in which direction, how much heat it generates. A key input to behavior modeling is the [[Fuel model|Fuel Model]], or type of fuel, through which the fire is burning.  Behavior modeling can also include whether the fire transitions from the surface (a "surface fire") to the tree crowns (a "crown fire"), as well as extreme fire behavior including rapid rates of spread, [[fire whirl]]s, and tall well-developed convection columns. Fire modeling also attempts to estimate fire effects, such as the [[ecology|ecological]] and [[hydrology|hydrological]] effects of the fire, fuel consumption, tree mortality, and amount and rate of smoke produced.

==Environmental factors==

Wildland fire behavior is affected by [[weather]], [[fuel]] characteristics, and [[topography]].

Weather influences fire through [[wind]] and [[moisture]].  [[Wind]] increases the fire spread in the wind direction, higher [[temperature]] makes the fire burn faster, while higher [[relative humidity]], and [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] (rain or snow) may slow it down or extinguish it altogether. Weather involving fast wind changes can be particularly dangerous, since they can suddenly change the fire direction and behavior. Such weather includes [[cold front]]s, [[foehn wind]]s, [[thunderstorm]] [[downdrafts]], [[sea breeze|sea and land breeze]], and [[Daytime (astronomy)|diurnal]] [[slope wind]]s.

Wildfire fuel includes grass, wood, and anything else that can burn. Small dry twigs burn faster while large logs burn slower; dry fuel ignites more easily and burns faster than wet fuel.

Topography factors that influence wildfires include the orientation toward the sun, which influences the amount of energy received from the sun, and the slope (fire spreads faster uphill). Fire can accelerate in narrow canyons and it can be slowed down or stopped by barriers such as creeks and roads.

These factors act in combination. Rain or snow increases the fuel moisture, high [[relative humidity]] slows the drying of the fuel, while winds can make fuel dry faster. Wind can change the fire-accelerating effect of slopes to effects such as downslope windstorms (called [[Santa Ana winds|Santa Ana]]s, foehn winds, East winds, depending on the geographic location). Fuel properties may vary with topography as plant density varies with elevation or aspect with respect to the sun.

It has long been recognized that "fires create their own weather." That is, the heat and moisture created by the fire feed back into the atmosphere, creating intense winds that drive the fire behavior. The heat produced by the wildfire changes the temperature of the atmosphere and creates strong updrafts, which can change the direction of surface winds. The water vapor released by the fire changes the moisture balance of the atmosphere. The water vapor can be carried away, where the [[latent heat]] stored in the vapor is released through [[condensation]].

==Approaches to fire modeling==

Like all models in computational science, fire models need to strike a balance between fidelity, availability of data, and fast execution. Wildland fire models span a vast range of complexity, from simple cause and effect principles to the most physically complex presenting a difficult supercomputing challenge that cannot hope to be solved faster than real time.

[[Forest-fire model]]s have been developed since 1940 to the present, but a lot of chemical and thermodynamic questions related to fire behaviour are still to be resolved. Scientists and their forest fire models from 1940 till 2003 are listed in article.&lt;ref&gt;E. Pastor, L. Zarate, E. Planas and J. Arnaldos. Mathematical models and calculation systems for the study of wildland fire behaviour. Progress in Energy and Combustion Science, 29:139–153, 2003.  Doi:10.1016/S0360-1285(03)00017-0)&lt;/ref&gt; Models can be divided into three groups: Empirical, Semi-empirical, and Physically based.

===Empirical models===

Conceptual models from experience and intuition from past fires can be used to anticipate the future. Many semi-empirical fire spread equations, as in those published by the USDA Forest Service,&lt;ref name="Rothermel-1972-MMP"&gt;Richard C. Rothermel. A mathematical model for predicting fire spread in wildland fires. USDA Forest Service Research Paper INT-115, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; Forestry Canada,&lt;ref name="Forestry-1992-DSC"&gt;Forestry Canada Fire Danger Group. Development and structure of the Canadian forest fire behavior prediction system. Forestry Canada, Science and Sustainable Development Directorate, Ottawa, ON, Information Report ST-X-3, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; Nobel, Bary, and Gill,&lt;ref name="Noble-1980-FMD"&gt;I. R. Noble, G. A. V. Bary, and A. M. Gill. McArthur's fire danger meters expressed as equations. ''Australian Journal of Ecology'', 5:201--203, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; and Cheney, Gould, and Catchpole&lt;ref name="Cheney-1993-IFW"&gt;N. P. Cheney, J. S. Gould, and W. R. Catchpole. The influence of fuel, weather, and fire shape variables on fire-spread in grasslands. ''International Journal of Wildland Fire'', 3:31--44, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; for Australasian fuel complexes have been developed for quick estimation of fundamental parameters of interest such as fire spread rate, flame length, and fireline intensity of surface fires at a point for specific fuel complexes, assuming a representative point-location wind and terrain slope. Based on the work by Fons's in 1946,&lt;ref name="Fons-1946-AFS"&gt;W. L. Fons. Analysis of fire spread in light fuels. ''Journal of Agricultural Research'', 72:93--121, 1946.&lt;/ref&gt; and Emmons in 1963,&lt;ref name="Emmons-1963-FF"&gt;H. W. Emmons. Fire in the forest. ''Fire Research Abstracts and Reviews'', 5:163, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; the quasi-steady equilibrium spread rate calculated for a surface fire on flat ground in no-wind conditions was calibrated using data of piles of sticks burned in a flame chamber/wind tunnel to represent other wind and slope conditions for the fuel complexes tested.

Two-dimensional fire growth models such as [[FARSITE]]&lt;ref name="Finney-1998-FFA"&gt;Mark A. Finney. FARSITE: Fire area simulator-model development and evaluation. Res. Pap. RMRS-RP-4, Ogden, UT: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station. 47 p., http://www.farsite.org, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; and Prometheus,&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite web | url = http://firegrowthmodel.ca/  | title = PROMETHEUS | publisher =  Tymstra, C.; Bryce, R.W.; Wotton, B.M.; Armitage, O.B. 2009. Development and structure of Prometheus: the Canadian wildland fire growth simulation Model.  Inf. Rep. NOR-X-417. Nat. Resour. Can., Can. For. Serv., North. For. Cent., Edmonton, AB. | accessdate = 2009-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Canadian wildland fire growth model designed to work in Canadian fuel complexes, have been developed that apply such semi-empirical relationships and others regarding ground-to-crown transitions to calculate fire spread and other parameters along the surface. Certain assumptions must be made in models such as FARSITE and Prometheus to shape the fire growth. For example, Prometheus and FARSITE use the Huygens principle of wave propagation. A set of equations that can be used to propagate (shape and direction) a fire front using an elliptical shape was developed by Richards in 1990.&lt;ref name="Richards-1990-EGM"&gt;G.D. Richards, “An Elliptical Growth Model of Forest Fire Fronts and Its Numerical Solution”, Int. J. Numer. Meth. Eng.,. 30:1163-1179, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; Although more sophisticated applications use a three-dimensional numerical weather prediction system to provide inputs such as wind velocity to one of the fire growth models listed above, the input was passive and the feedback of the fire upon the atmospheric wind and humidity are not accounted for.

===Physically based models and coupling with the atmosphere===

A simplified physically based two-dimensional fire spread models based upon conservation laws that use radiation as the dominant heat transfer mechanism and convection, which represents the effect of wind and slope, lead to [[reaction–diffusion system]]s of [[partial differential equation]]s.&lt;ref name="Asensio-2002-WFM"&gt;M. I. Asensio and L. Ferragut. On a wildland fire model with radiation. ''Int. J. Numer. Meth. Engrg.'', 54:137--157, 2002 [https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/nme.420 fultext]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mandel-2008-WMD"&gt;Jan Mandel, Lynn S. Bennethum, Jonathan D. Beezley, Janice L. Coen, Craig C.

[https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.matcom.2008.03.015 fulltext] [https://arxiv.org/abs/0709.0086 arXiv]&lt;/ref&gt;

More complex physical models join [[computational fluid dynamics]] models with a wildland fire component and allow the fire to feed back upon the atmosphere. These models include [[NCAR]]'s Coupled Atmosphere-Wildland Fire-Environment (CAWFE) model developed in 2005,&lt;ref name="Coen-2005-SBE"&gt;J. L. Coen.

[https://dx.doi.org/10.1071/WF03043 fulltext]&lt;/ref&gt; and are beginning to be applied to wildland urban interface house-to-house fire spread at the community-scale.

The cost of added physical complexity is a corresponding increase in computational cost, so much so that a full three-dimensional explicit treatment of [[combustion]] in wildland fuels by [[direct numerical simulation]] (DNS) at scales relevant for atmospheric modeling does not exist, is beyond current supercomputers, and does not currently make sense to do because of the limited skill of weather models at spatial resolution under 1&amp;nbsp;km. Consequently, even these more complex models parameterize the fire in some way, for example, papers by Clark&lt;ref name="Clark-1996-CAFb"&gt;T. L. Clark, M. A. Jenkins, J. Coen, and David Packham. A coupled atmospheric-fire model: Convective Froude number and dynamic fingering. ''International Journal of Wildland Fire'', 6:177--190, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark-1996-CAF"&gt;Terry L. Clark, Marry Ann Jenkins, Janice Coen, and David Packham. A coupled atmospheric-fire model: Convective feedback on fire line dynamics. ''J. Appl. Meteor'', 35:875--901, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; use equations developed by Rothermel for the USDA forest service&lt;ref name="Rothermel-1972-MMP"/&gt; to calculate local fire spread rates using fire-modified local winds. And, although FIRETEC and WFDS carry prognostic conservation equations for the reacting fuel and oxygen concentrations, the computational grid cannot be fine enough to resolve the reaction rate-limiting mixing of fuel and oxygen, so approximations must be made concerning the subgrid-scale temperature distribution or the combustion reaction rates themselves. These models also are too small-scale to interact with a weather model, so the fluid motions use a computational fluid dynamics model confined in a box much smaller than the typical wildfire.

Attempts to create the most complete theoretical model were made by Albini F.A. in USA and Grishin A.M.&lt;ref&gt;A.M. Grishin. Mathematical models of forest fires and New Methods of Fighting Them. Publishing House of the Tomsk University, Tomsk, Russia, 1997. (edited by F.A. Albini)&lt;/ref&gt; in Russia. Grishin's work is based on the fundamental laws of physics, conservation and theoretical justifications are provided. The simplified two-dimensional model of running crown forest fire was developed in [[Belarusian State University]] by Barovik D.V.&lt;ref&gt;Barovik, D.; Taranchuk, V. 2010. Mathematical modelling of running crown forest fires. Mathematical Modelling and Analysis 15(2):161-174 [http://elib.bsu.by/bitstream/123456789/10110/1/TVB_2010.pdf fulltext]&lt;/ref&gt; and Taranchuk V.B..

==Data assimilation==

[[Data assimilation]] periodically adjusts the model state to incorporate new data using statistical methods. Because fire is highly nonlinear and irreversible, data assimilation for fire models poses special challenges, and standard methods, such as the [[ensemble Kalman filter]] (EnKF) do not work well. Statistical variability of corrections and especially large corrections may result in nonphysical states, which tend to be preceded or accompanied by large spatial [[gradient]]s. In order to ease this problem, the [[Regularization (mathematics)|regularized]] EnKF&lt;ref name="Johns-2008-TEK"&gt;Craig J. Johns and Jan Mandel. A two-stage ensemble Kalman filter for smooth data assimilation. ''Environmental and Ecological Statistics'', 15:101--110, 2008. Proceedings of Conference on New Developments of Statistical Analysis in Wildlife, Fisheries, and Ecological Research, Oct 13-16, 2004, Columbia, MI. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10651-007-0033-0 fulltext] [http://math.ucdenver.edu/~jmandel/papers/cjjm-fires-revised.pdf preprint]&lt;/ref&gt; penalizes large changes of spatial gradients in the Bayesian update in EnKF. The regularization technique has a stabilizing effect on the simulations in the ensemble but it does not improve much the ability of the EnKF to track the data: The posterior ensemble is made out of [[linear combination]]s of the prior ensemble, and if a reasonably close location and shape of the fire cannot be found between the linear combinations, the data assimilation is simply out of luck, and the ensemble cannot approach the data. From that point on, the ensemble evolves essentially without regard to the data. This is called filter divergence. So, there is clearly a need to adjust the simulation state by a position change rather than an additive correction only. The ''morphing EnKF''&lt;ref name="Beezley-2008-MEK"&gt;Jonathan D. Beezley and Jan Mandel. Morphing ensemble Kalman filters. ''Tellus'', 60A:131--140, 2008 [https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0870.2007.00275.x fulltext] [https://arxiv.org/abs/0705.3693 preprint]&lt;/ref&gt; combines the ideas of data assimilation with [[image registration]] and [[morphing]] to provide both additive and position correction in a natural manner, and can be used to change a model state reliably in response to data.&lt;ref name="Mandel-2007-DAW"/&gt;

==Limitations and practical use==

The limitations on fire modeling are not entirely computational. At this level, the models encounter limits in knowledge about the composition of [[pyrolysis]] products and [[reaction pathway]]s, in addition to gaps in basic understanding about some aspects of fire behavior such as fire spread in live fuels and surface-to-crown fire transition.

Thus, while more complex models have value in studying fire behavior and testing fire spread in a range of scenarios, from the application point of view, FARSITE and [[Palm (PDA)|Palm]]-based applications of BEHAVE have shown great utility as practical in-the-field tools because of their ability to provide estimates of fire behavior in real time. While the coupled fire-atmosphere models have the ability to incorporate the ability of the fire to affect its own local weather, and model many aspects of the explosive, unsteady nature of fires that cannot be incorporated in current tools, it remains a challenge to apply these more complex models in a faster-than-real-time operational environment. Also, although they have reached a certain degree of realism when simulating specific natural fires, they must yet address issues such as identifying what specific, relevant operational information they could provide beyond current tools, how the simulation time could fit the operational time frame for decisions (therefore, the simulation must run substantially faster than real time), what temporal and spatial resolution must be used by the model, and how they estimate the inherent uncertainty in numerical weather prediction in their forecast. These operational constraints must be used to steer model development.

In [[probability theory]], a '''zero–one law''' is a result that states that an event must have probability 0 or 1 and no intermediate value. Sometimes, the statement is that the limit of certain probabilities must be 0 or 1.

It may refer to: 
* [[Borel–Cantelli lemma]]
* [[Blumenthal's zero–one law]] for [[Markov process]]es,
* [[Engelbert–Schmidt zero–one law]] for continuous, nondecreasing additive functionals of Brownian motion,
* [[Hewitt–Savage zero–one law]] for exchangeable sequences,
* [[Kolmogorov's zero–one law]] for the tail σ-algebra,
* [[Lévy's zero–one law]], related to martingale convergence.
* [[topological zero–one law]] related to [[meager set]]s

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1350">'''Zimmer's conjecture''' is a statement in [[mathematics]] "which has to do with the circumstances under which [[geometric space]]s exhibit certain kinds of [[Symmetry|symmetries]]."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.quantamagazine.org/a-proof-about-where-symmetries-cant-exist-20181023/|title=A Proof About Where Symmetries Can’t Exist|last=Hartnett|first=Kevin|date=2018-10-23|work=Quanta Magazine|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was named after the mathematician [[Robert Zimmer]].  The conjecture states that there can exist symmetries (specifically [[higher-rank lattice]]s) in a higher dimension that cannot exist in lower dimensions.

In 2017, the conjecture was proven by Aaron Brown and Sebastian Hurtado-Salazar of the [[University of Chicago]] and David Fisher of [[Indiana University]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last=Brown|first=Aaron|last2=Fisher|first2=David|last3=Hurtado|first3=Sebastian|date=2017-10-07|title=Zimmer's conjecture for actions of SL(𝑚,ℤ)|eprint=1710.02735|class=math.DS}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ipam.ucla.edu/programs/workshops/new-methods-for-zimmers-conjecture/|title=New Methods for Zimmer's Conjecture|work=IPAM|access-date=2018-11-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
