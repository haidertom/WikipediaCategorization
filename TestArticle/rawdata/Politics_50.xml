The '''1953 Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference''' was the sixth [[Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference|Meeting]] of the [[List of Commonwealth Heads of Government|Heads of Government]] of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. It was held in the [[United Kingdom]] in June 1953 on the occasion of the [[Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II]], and was hosted by that country's [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], Sir [[Winston Churchill]].

The meeting was held prior to a Three Powers conference between Churchill, [[President of the United States|US President]] [[Dwight Eisenhower]], and [[Prime Minister of France|French Prime Minister]] [[Joseph Laniel]] in [[Bermuda]] which Commonwealth leaders hoped would lead to a Four Powers summit with the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wdIwAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=oN0FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4656,2191080&amp;dq=commonwealth+prime+ministers|title=Ottawa Citizen - Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com|access-date=2016-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Korean Armistice Agreement|Armistice talks]] to conclude the [[Korean War]] were also discussed.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vciLoneE8GYC|title=The Commonwealth at the Summit: Communiqués of Commonwealth Heads of Government Meetings, 1944-1986|last=Secretariat|first=Commonwealth|date=1987-01-01|publisher=Commonwealth Secretariat|isbn=9780850923179|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerns about the security of the [[Suez Canal]] and the importance of maintaining British military installations were also discussed (see [[Suez War]]) as were the economic situation and the objectives for development and strengthening of the [[Pound sterling]] area set out at the [[1952 Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Economic Conference]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''2007 [[Swaziland|Swazi]] general strike''' has been ongoing since 25 July 2007, led by the [[Swaziland Federation of Trade Unions]], the [[Swaziland Federation of Labour]] and the [[Swaziland National Association of Teachers]]. They plan to stage a two-hour full stoppage of public life every month until the incumbent absolute monarch [[Mswati III of Swaziland|Mswati III]] gives in to their demands:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Thulani |last=Mthethwa |title=Swazis Strike for Democracy |url=https://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2007/07/26/ap3956890.html |work=Associated Press, republished on Forbes.com |publisher= Forbes.com LLC|date=26 July 2007 |accessdate=2007-08-04 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Swazi parliamentary election, 2008|multi-party elections in October 2008]], that benefits cease to be taxed and an end to [[absolute monarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Striking workers call for multi-party elections in Swaziland |url=http://news.monstersandcritics.com/europe/news/article_1335272.php/Striking_workers_call_for_multi-party_elections_in_Swaziland |work=Deutsche Presse-Agentur, republished on Monsters and Critics |publisher=Monsters and Critics.com, WotR Ltd |date=26 July 2007 |accessdate=2007-08-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070829211517/http://news.monstersandcritics.com/europe/news/article_1335272.php/Striking_workers_call_for_multi-party_elections_in_Swaziland |archivedate=29 August 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The demonstrations constituted Swaziland's biggest civil movement for over a decade, since the last large-scale protests in 1996.&lt;ref name=citizen/&gt;

Government spokespersons denied the unions' and strikers' claims, stating that they should not demonstrate, but rather lobby the parliament, as only parliament has the power to change the constitution to allow multi-party elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Country King Faces Trouble Amid Protests Over Lack of Reforms |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200707300437.html |work=The Nation, republished on [[allAfrica.com]] |publisher=AllAfrica Global Media |date=30 July 2007 |accessdate=2007-08-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 August 2007, union representatives threatened further strikes if the government was not willing to listen, and also raised labour issues in addition to their political demands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mg.co.za/articlePage.aspx?articleid=315665&amp;area=/breaking_news/breaking_news__business/ Swazi unions threaten further action : Mail &amp; Guardian Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927214627/http://www.mg.co.za/articlePage.aspx?articleid=315665&amp;area=%2Fbreaking_news%2Fbreaking_news__business%2F |date=27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14977">A controversy arose during the [[Hong Kong legislative election, 2016|2016 Legislative Council election]] in Hong Kong as the [[Electoral Affairs Commission]] (EAC) banned six potential [[Localism in Hong Kong|localist]] candidates from running for the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong]] (LegCo). The EAC carried out a new election measure to require all candidates to sign an additional "confirmation form" in the nomination to declare their understanding of Hong Kong being an inalienable part of China as stipulated in the Article 1, Article 12 and Article 159(4) of the [[Basic Law of Hong Kong]].

Localist [[Hong Kong Indigenous]]'s [[Edward Leung]] and [[Pro-democracy camp in Hong Kong|pan-democrat]] [[League of Social Democrats]] (LSD) [[Avery Ng]] sought a [[judicial review]] but the court refused to immediately hear the judicial reviews. Leung subsequently signed the confirmation form but was asked by returning officers whether they would still advocate independence along with some other localist candidates including [[Civic Passion]]'s [[Alvin Cheng]] and [[Hong Kong National Party]]'s [[Chan Ho-tin]].

After the end of the nomination period, nominations of six localist candidates, Hong Kong National Party's Chan Ho-tin, [[Democratic Progressive Party of Hong Kong|Democratic Progressive Party]]'s Yeung Ke-cheong, Nationalist Hong Kong's Nakade Hitsujiko, [[Conservative Party (Hong Kong)|Conservative Party]]'s Alice Lai Yee-man, Hong Kong Indigenous's Edward Leung and independent Chan Kwok-keung, were "invalidated", including Edward Leung which EAC returning officer Cora Ho Lai-sheung rejected Leung's nomination on the basis of she did not trust Leung "genuinely changed his previous stance for independence."

==Course of events==

===Confirmation form===
On 14 July 2016, the [[Electoral Affairs Commission]] (EAC) announced its plan to require all candidates to sign an additional "confirmation form" in the nomination to declare their understanding of Hong Kong being an inalienable part of China as stipulated in the Article 1 of the [[Basic Law of Hong Kong|Basic Law]], Article 12 which stated that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) shall be a local administrative region of the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC), which shall enjoy a high degree of autonomy and come directly under the [[Central People's Government]], as well as Article 159(4) which stipulated that no amendment to the Basic Law shall contravene the established basic policies of the PRC regarding Hong Kong (i.e. Hong Kong should be a special administrative region of the PRC under the “one country, two systems” principle). Article 104 also required members of the Legislative Council to swear to uphold the Basic Law and swear allegiance to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region before assuming office.&lt;ref name="gov"&gt;{{cite web|title=
HKSAR Government responds to media enquiries regarding 2016 Legislative Council election|url=http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201607/30/P2016073000700.htm|work=The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region|date=30 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As many potential localist candidates are advocating or promoting Hong Kong independence, the EAC stated that “independence of the HKSAR” was inconsistent with the constitutional and legal status of the HKSAR as stipulated in the Basic Law, as well as the established basic policies of the PRC regarding Hong Kong.&lt;ref name="gov"/&gt; It also stated that returning officers were required to take into account all relevant information before deciding whether a nomination is valid according to {{Cite Hong Kong ordinance|name=Legislative Council Ordinance|542|42A}} and Electoral Affairs Commission (Electoral Procedure) (Legislative Council) Regulation [http://www.legislation.gov.hk/blis_pdf.nsf/6799165D2FEE3FA94825755E0033E532/03A8423C8A03F968482575EF0016E835?OpenDocument&amp;bt=0 541D] § 16 (the Regulation) and request the candidate to provide any other information the returning officer deems appropriate to satisfy him/her that the nomination is valid according to Sections 10 or 11 of the Regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201607/19/P2016071900950p.htm|title=EAC's request to sign Confirmation Form has legal basis|date=19 July 2016|work=The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor]] director Law Yuk-kai criticised the government's move as "censorship of political ideas" and a breach of [[freedom of thought]].&lt;ref name="cant run"/&gt;

[[Localism in Hong Kong|Localist]] candidates reacted differently to the new measure. [[Civic Passion]]'s [[Alvin Cheng]] signed the confirmation form when he submitted his nomination to run in the [[Hong Kong Island (constituency)|Hong Kong Island constituency]]. Civic Passion spokesman and [[New Territories West (constituency)|New Territories West]] candidate [[Cheng Chung-tai]] justified the group's decision as a form of civil disobedience.

[[Edward Leung]] of the pro-independence [[Hong Kong Indigenous]] who won over 66,000 votes in February's [[New Territories East by-election, 2016|New Territories East by-election]] said he would not sign the form and would seek a [[judicial review]].&lt;ref name="cant run"&gt;{{cite news|title=‘Accept Hong Kong is part of China or you can’t run in Legco elections’|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/1989910/accept-hong-kong-part-china-or-you-cant-run-legco-elections|date=14 July 2016|newspaper=South China Morning Post|first1=Joyce|last1=Ng|last2=Ng|first2=Kang-chung}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[pan-democrats]] also stated they would boycott the new election measure by not signing the additional form.&lt;ref name=thestandard171871&gt;{{cite news|title=Pan-dems reject poll declaration|first=Phoenix|last=Un|url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/section-news.php?id=171871|newspaper=The Standard|date=22 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Returning officers' emails===
On 22 July, Edward Leung, who had not yet signed the confirmation form, received email from the EAC asking if he would still advocate Hong Kong independence after submitting the original nomination form stating he would uphold the Basic Law and pledge allegiance to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. Civic Passion’s Alvin Cheng and the Hong Kong National Party’s [[Chan Ho-tin]] both received similar emails on 25 July.&lt;ref name=20160726hongkongfp&gt;{{cite news|title=Election officials email more pro-independence LegCo candidates asking about political stance|first=Kris|last=Cheng|url=https://www.hongkongfp.com/2016/07/26/election-officials-email-more-pro-independence-legco-candidates-asking-about-political-stance/|newspaper=Hong Kong Free Press|date=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two other localist candidates, Nationalist Hong Kong's Nakade Hitsujiko and [[Conservative Party (Hong Kong)|Conservative Party]]'s Alice Lai Yee-man, received similar emails in the following days. Those questions were claimed to be a factor to determine the validity of their nominations.

===Judicial review attempt===
Represented by [[Senior Counsel]] [[Martin Lee]], [[Edward Leung]] and [[Pro-democracy camp in Hong Kong|pan-democrat]] [[League of Social Democrats]] (LSD) chairman [[Avery Ng]] and general secretary Chan Tak-cheung filed a judicial review, arguing that the EAC had acted beyond its powers, and accuse the government of political censorship. On 27 July, [[High Court of Hong Kong|High Court]] judge Justice Thomas Au Hing-cheung refused to immediately hear the judicial reviews, as he said he saw no urgency in dealing with the case before the end of the nomination period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Setback to legal challenge against new Hong Kong election rule|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/1995611/setback-legal-challenge-against-new-hong-kong-election-rule|newspaper=South China Morning Post|date=27 July 2016|first1=Eddie|last1=Lee|first2=Owen|last2=Fung}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the court's decision, Leung agreed to sign the confirmation form.&lt;ref name=scmp1996189&gt;{{cite news|title=Hong Kong localist gives in to election rule while others stick to their guns and are cleared to run|first=Owen|last=Fung|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/1996189/hong-kong-localist-gives-election-rule-while-others-stick|newspaper=South China Morning Post|date=28 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Invalidations===
On 30 July, Chan Ho-tin received an email from the EAC which said his nomination in New Territories West had been "invalidated" as he did not comply with the {{Cite Hong Kong ordinance|name=Legislative Council Ordinance|542|40|1|b}}, since he had refused to sign the additional confirmation form.&lt;ref name="disqualified"&gt;{{cite news|title=Hong Kong National Party convenor disqualified from running in Legislative Council polls|newspaper=South China Morning Post|date=30 July 2016|first1=Emily|last1=Tsang|first2=Elizabeth|last2=Cheung|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/1996994/hong-kong-national-party-convenor-disqualified-running}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A day after, Yeung Ke-cheong of the localist [[Democratic Progressive Party of Hong Kong|Democratic Progressive Party]], positioned second on a candidate list with Jonathan Ho Chi-kwong in [[Kowloon West (constituency)|Kowloon West]] was also invalidated as he, unlike Chan, explicitly rejected the Basic Law by not signing both the original and additional confirmation forms to pledge to uphold the Basic Law. Yeung said he would launch a judicial review.&lt;ref name=scmp1997371&gt;{{cite news|title=‘I was disqualified’: second Hong Kong localist candidate barred from running in Legco elections|newspaper=South China Morning Post|date=31 July 2016|first=Jeffie|last=Lam|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/1997371/i-was-disqualified-second-hong-kong-localist-candidate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lawyers' joint statement===
On 3 August, all 30 Legal Subsector members of the 1,200-strong [[Election Committee]], which is responsible for choosing [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong]] including former [[Hong Kong Bar Association]] chairmen Edward Chan King-sang SC and Philip Dykes SC questioned whether returning officers had the power to investigate the “genuineness” of candidates’ declarations and accordingly disqualify their candidacies. In the statement, it wrote that "[the Section 40 of the Legislative Council Ordinance] does not give the returning officer any power to inquire into the so-called genuineness of the candidates’ declarations, let alone making a subjective and political decision to disqualify a candidate without following any due process on the purported ground that the candidate will not genuinely uphold the Basic Law." It also wrote that "arbitrary and unlawful exercise of powers by government officials ... are most damaging to the rule of law in Hong Kong."&lt;ref name="lawyers"/&gt;

However, [[Secretary for Justice (Hong Kong)|Secretary for Justice]] [[Rimsky Yuen]] said officers did have the power to consider some evidence, as they had done in the past. He did not specify any past cases.&lt;ref name="lawyers"&gt;{{cite news|title=Lawyers question power of returning officers to disqualify Hong Kong poll candidates|date=3 August 2016|newspaper=South China Morning Post|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/1998842/lawyers-question-power-returning-officers-disqualify-hong|first=Joyce|last=Ng}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="First pro-independence rally"===
On 5 August, the Hong Kong independence advocates who were banned from the election launched a rally which was dubbed “first pro-independence rally in Hong Kong”. The rally drew about 12000 people. The pro-independence activists vowed they would press on with their cause and campaign for wider public support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hong Kong localists remain defiant at ‘historic’ rally|newspaper=South China Morning Post|date=5 August 2016|first1=Joyce|last1=Ng|first2=Tony|last2=Cheung|first3=Owen|last3=Fung|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/1999664/more-1000-hong-kong-police-mobilised-localist-rally}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''AKPD Message and Media''' is an [[United States|American]] [[political consulting|political]] and [[media consulting|media]] [[management consulting|consulting firm]] catering to [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidates and related causes. Formerly Axelrod and Associates, it is named after its four original partners: [[David Axelrod (political consultant)|David Axelrod]], John Kupper, [[David Plouffe]], and John Del Cecato. All four were members of [[Barack Obama]]'s [[Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008|2008 presidential campaign]], with Plouffe serving as [[campaign manager]], Axelrod as senior strategist, and Del Cecato as media advisor. Axelrod, who is personally close to Obama, left AKPD to serve as [[Senior Advisor to the President]] in the Obama Administration and sold the firm to Kupper, Del Cecato and Larry Grisolano. AKPD's advertising and strategy have been widely credited for significantly altering elections in their clients favor.&lt;ref&gt;http://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/branding-bill-de-blasio-inside-the-message-machine-that-made-nyc-s-next-mayor&lt;/ref&gt; TIME has praised one of their most talked about ads, "Dante," as "The Ad that Won the New York Mayor's Race.".&lt;ref&gt;http://nation.time.com/2013/09/11/the-ad-that-won-the-new-york-mayors-race/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; AKPD's offices are located in Chicago, Washington DC, and New York where it has recently expanded its presence by partnering with Bully Pulpit Interactive and Analytics Media Group.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bpimedia.com/one-year-after-helping-re-elect-president-obama-political-firms-expand-presence-in-new-york/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Asian values''' was a political ideology of the 1990s, which defined elements of society, culture and history common to the nations of Southeast and East Asia. It aimed to use commonalities – for example, the principle of [[collectivism]] – to unify people for their economic and social good and to create a [[Pan-Asianism|pan-Asian identity]]. This contrasted with perceived European ideals of the [[universal rights]] of man. The concept was advocated by [[Mahathir Mohamad]] ([[Prime Minister of Malaysia]], 1981–2003, 2018–present) and by [[Lee Kuan Yew]] ([[Prime Minister of Singapore]], 1959–1990), as well as other Asian leaders. The popularity of the concept waned after the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]], when it became evident that Asia lacked any coherent regional institutional mechanism to deal with the crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Gred L. [http://www.springerlink.com/content/tc9dt6eqk9jj1ll0/  "Asian Values revisited"] ''Asia Europe journal'' 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
Various definitions of ''Asian values'' have been put forth. Generally, the phrase alludes to  influences by [[Confucianism]]&lt;ref name="De Bary (1998)"/&gt;{{rp|page=10}} – in particular, [[filial piety]] or loyalty towards the family, corporation, and nation; the forgoing of personal [[Freedom (political)|freedom]] for the sake of society's stability and prosperity; the pursuit of academic and technological excellence; and, a strong work ethic together with [[Frugality|thrift]].

Proponents of so-called "Asian values", who tend to support Asian-style [[authoritarian]] governments,&lt;ref name="De Bary (1998)"/&gt;{{rp|page=13}} claim these values are more appropriate for the region than [[Western democracy]] with its emphasis on individual freedoms.&lt;ref&gt;Mark R Thompson, [http://sites.asiasociety.org/asia21summit/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/PacificAsia.pdf "Pacific Asia after 'Asian values'"], ''Third World Quarterly'', 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Asian values" were codified and promoted in the [[universal declaration of human rights#Bangkok Declaration|Bangkok Declaration of 1993]], which re-emphasized the principles of sovereignty, self-determination, and non-interference in civil and political rights. They included:
*Preference for [[social]] harmony;
*Concern with [[socio-economic]] prosperity and the collective well-being of the community;
*Loyalty and respect towards figures of authority;
*Preference for [[collectivism]] and [[communitarianism]].

== History ==
Historically, there has been no shared "Asian" identity, and the concept of unified geographical regional identity at the time of its popularity in the 20th century was not strictly limited to Asia.&lt;ref name="De Bary (1998)"&gt;De Bary W. [https://books.google.com/books?id=pg5z-ho6Y4EC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22asian+values%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=W217U9LON86F8gW7woGYCQ&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22asian%20values%22&amp;f=false "Asian Values and Human Rights: A Confucian Communitarian Perspective."] Harvard University Press, 1998 {{ISBN|0674049551}}, 9780674049550.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=2}} Asian values gained popularity in the [[People's Republic of China]], [[Malaysia]] (under [[Mahathir Mohamad]]), [[Singapore]] (under [[Lee Kuan Yew]]), [[Indonesia]] and in [[Japan]] (perhaps as early as the pre World War II era).&lt;ref&gt;Bar M. [https://books.google.com/books?id=XBXMOLjOVAcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22asian+values%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=W217U9LON86F8gW7woGYCQ&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22asian%20values%22&amp;f=false "Cultural Politics and Asian Values: The Tepid War."] Routledge, 2004 {{ISBN|0415338263}}, 9780415338264.&lt;/ref&gt; In the West, the study of Asian values was seen as a way to understand Asia and foster a closer relationship with the region.&lt;ref&gt;Cauquelin J. et al. [https://books.google.com/books?id=A42sAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT3&amp;dq=%22asian+values%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=W217U9LON86F8gW7woGYCQ&amp;ved=0CGEQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22asian%20values%22&amp;f=false "Asian Values: Encounter with Diversity."] Routledge, 2014 {{ISBN|1136841253}}, 9781136841255.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents in Malaysia and Singapore claim the concept helped reconcile [[Islam]], [[Confucianism]] and [[Hinduism]] and was unifying because it was different to the philosophy of the West.&lt;ref&gt;Nishida K ''Nishida Kitaro Zenshu'' (Complete Works of Nishida Kitaro in 19 volumes), 4th ed., Iwanami Shoten, Tokyo 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; Lee maintained that, more than economics or politics, a nation's culture would determine its fate.&lt;ref&gt;Zakaria F [http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/49691/fareed-zakaria/a-conversation-with-lee-kuan-yew "A Conversation with Lee Kwan Yu"] ''Foreign Affairs'', Journal of the Council on Foreign Affairs, a non-partisan organisation, Florida, US. March - April 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; 
In Japan, a concept of "Ideals of the East" was embraced in some [[nationalist]] circles because it challenged the West and also because it offered the possibility of Japanese leadership in a ''new Asia''.&lt;ref&gt;Okakura K ''The Ideals of the East'', Tuttle Publishing, North Clarenton 1904, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Some attribute the economic success of East and Southeast Asian nations in the 1960s to 1980s to  "Asian values"; a ''third-way'', Asian political model that was an alternative to [[totalitarianism]] and [[liberal democracy]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}{{who|date=May 2014}}

"Asian values" was also evident in the planning of the handover of [[Hong Kong]] to China in 1997.{{clarify|date=May 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;Beatty B. [https://books.google.com/books?id=vbBFOPMKrAkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22asian+values%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=W217U9LON86F8gW7woGYCQ&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22asian%20values%22&amp;f=false "Democracy, Asian Values, and Hong Kong: Evaluating Political Elite Beliefs."] Greenwood Publishing Group, 2003 p14 {{ISBN|0275976882}}, 9780275976880.&lt;/ref&gt;

The popularity of the concept did not persist. Some speculate it might have contributed to the religious, social, cultural and economic changes occurring in Asia in that time; for example, the [[Asian financial crisis]] and the [[Fall of Suharto|collapse]] of the [[New Order (Indonesia)|Suharto regime]] in [[Indonesia]] may have been successfully counteracted by liberal democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Milner A. [http://dspace.anu.edu.au/html/1885/41912/values.html "What's Happened to Asian Values?"] Faculty of Asian Studies, ANU, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Krugman P. [http://web.mit.edu/krugman/www/swansong.html "Latin America's Swan Song"] An MIT web page article, unsourced and date not stated. Accessed 21 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Francis Fukuyama F. "The End of History and the Last Man". Free Press 1992. {{ISBN|0-02-910975-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, [[Jusuf Kalla]], the vice-president of Indonesia, linked Asian values with the proposed East Asian Free Trade Agreement and the East Asian Community arising from the [[East Asia Summit]]. He partly defended Asian values by placing emphasis on co-operation over competition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.people.com.cn/200612/01/eng20061201_327303.html "Indonesia calls for countries to bear Asian values."] People's Daily Online, an English language Chinese online news website. Accessed 21 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Asian values" continues to be discussed in academe with reference to the question of the universality [[human rights]] (as opposed to a position of [[cultural relativism]]).&lt;ref&gt;

Studies of rice farming have indicated how large-scale agriculture affected the collectivist mindset of East Asians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=T. Talhelm|title=Large-Scale Psychological Differences Within China Explained by Rice Versus Wheat Agriculture|journal=Science|date=2014|pages=603–608|doi=10.1126/science.1246850|display-authors=etal|volume=344|pmid=24812395}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to wheat farming, rice farming is a labor-intensive practice that requires cooperation among many people.&lt;ref name="Outliers: The story of success"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gladwell|first1=Malcolm|title=Outliers: The story of success|date=2008|publisher=New York: Little, Brown and Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
A number of criticisms of Asian values have been made.&lt;ref&gt;Bruun O. and Jacobsen M.

The '''[[Bratislava]] Declaration''' was the result of the conference held on 3 August 1968 for the representatives of the Communist parties and Worker's parties of [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]], [[East Germany]], [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]], the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|USSR]], and [[Czechoslovakia]].&lt;ref name="bratislava declaration august 3rd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.thinkquest.org/C001155/documents/doc41.htm|accessdate=4 April 2014|title=The Bratislava Declaration, August 3, 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; The declaration was a response to the [[Prague Spring]]. It affirmed unshakable fidelity to Marxism–Leninism and proletarian internationalism, and declared an implacable struggle against "bourgeois" ideology and all "anti-socialist" forces. The Soviet Union also expressed its intention to intervene in any [[Warsaw Pact]] country if a "bourgeois" system – a pluralist system of several political parties – was ever established.&lt;ref name="ussr czechoslovakia intervention"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onwar.com/aced/data/cite/czechoslovak1968.htm|accessdate=12 October 2014|title=USSR Czechoslovakia Intervention 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18113">The '''capitalist peace''', or '''capitalist peace theory''', posits that according to a given criterion for economic development ([[capitalism]]), developed economies have not engaged in war with each other, and rarely enter into low-level disputes. These theories have been proposed as an explanation for the [[democratic peace theory]] by accounting for both democracy and the peace among democratic nations. The exact nature of the causality depends upon both the proposed variable and the measure of the indicator for the concept used.

==History==
The philosophical roots of capitalist peace can be traced back to [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Joseph Schumpeter]], [[Norman Angell]], and [[Classical liberalism|classical economic theory]]. In his 1795 essay Perpetual Peace, Immanuel Kant argued, among other things, that "the spirit of commerce . . . sooner or later takes hold of every nation, and is incompatible with war."&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel. 1939 [1795]. Perpetual Peace. Translated and Edited by Nicholas Murray Butler. New York: Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early twentieth century Norman Angell reasoned that trade interdependence in modern economies makes war unprofitable.&lt;ref&gt;Angell, Norman. 1913 [1911]. The Great Illusion: A Study of the Relation of Military Power to National Advantage. G.P. Putnam's Sons: London.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Joseph Schumpeter offered the observation that with the advancement of capitalism people form "an unwarlike disposition."&lt;ref&gt;Schumpeter, Joseph. 1955. Imperialism ; Social Classes : Two Essays. Translated by Heinz Norden. New York : Meridian Books. Pp. 66-68&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern capitalist peace emerged with the democratic peace. In one of the earliest systematic confirmations of the democratic peace,&lt;ref&gt;Stuart A. Bremer, "Dangerous Dyads: Conditions Affecting the Likelihood of Interstate War, 1816-1965," ''Journal of Conflict Resolution'', 36:309-41 (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; Stuart Bremer also examined the relationship between capitalism and war. He found capitalism to be a more powerful force for peace than democracy, yet the democratic peace accrued much more attention in the academic and policy literature. Today at least four theories of capitalist peace can be identified, with some of these theories claiming that a capitalist peace may subsume the democratic one, given that capitalism may be the cause of both democracy and peace.

==Definitions==
A key to explaining the capitalist peace rests on the indicative measures for capitalism. There are at least four different definitions of capitalism currently being employed. {{Citation Needed|reason=There's just so many claims here without any citation at all|date=June 2018}}

===Capitalism&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;===
A number of models of the capitalist peace equate free markets with capitalism. In this usage, free markets and trade cause economic development, which in turn accounts for the peace among nations with advanced economies.

===Capitalism&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;===
A second understanding of capitalism is one that is conceptualized based on the intensity of market contracting in a society, where a capitalist economy is defined as one where most actors in the economy are integrated by contracting in the market. By definition contracts must be voluntary and undertaken without coercion.

===Capitalism&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;===
In the third measure for capitalism  inter-state trade is seen as an indicator for a developed, hence a capitalist economy. The level of trade interdependence, therefore, is the operationalized measure of this third type of capitalism.

===Capitalism&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;===
The final way that capitalism has been measured is with the size of government. States that have limited governments, hence large private sectors, are supposed to be capitalist economies. The size of government is used as an indicator for the level of capitalism a state has achieved.

==Explanations==
There are five primary theories that have attempted to explain the capitalist peace, each of which has used one of the above definitions of capitalism. Each theory has achieved varying levels of success and empirical corroboration, although they all rely on capitalism as the main explanatory variable for peace.

===Trade interdependence===
The interdependent trade explanation for the capitalist peace is built on the foundations of classical economic theory. This idea, which can be traced back to Kant, became the original theoretical explanation for the capitalist peace. In 1996, Erich Weede tied trade and free markets to development and peace, proposing that trade interdependence caused peace between nations.&lt;ref&gt;Erich Weede, Economic Development, Social Order, and World Politics. Boulder, CO: Lynne Rienner (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; Weede followed this up with what he called the "capitalist peace".&lt;ref&gt;Erich Weede, Balance of Power, Globalization and the Capitalist Peace, Potsdam: Liberal Verlag (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; However, the empirical findings of the link between trade and development have been drawn into question, as one study found that the proportion of GDP to foreign trade is only 0.08, measured by logged GDP per capita.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1080/03050621003785074 | first = Michael | last = Mousseau | year = 2010 | title = Coming to Terms with the Capitalist Peace | url = | journal = International Interactions | volume = 36 | issue = 2| pages = 185–192 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic norms theory===
Economic norms theory links the economic conditions of [[clientelism]], which prevail in many lower income societies, and a contract-intensive economy, which prevails in many higher income societies, with divergent political interests and habits.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Mousseau, "The Social Market Roots of Democratic Peace," ''International Security'', Vol. 33, No. 4 (Spring 2009), 52-86.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Mousseau, "Market Civilization and its Clash with Terror," ''International Security'', Vol. 27, No. 3 (Winter 2002-2003), 5-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Economic norms theory arose as an alternative explanation to the democratic peace, because it identified the causal relationship between democracy and peace as spurious. [[Michael Mousseau]] identified contract-intensive economies as a possible cause of both democracy and peace. The explanation is based on two aspects widely accepted in social science: (1) [[bounded rationality]]; and (2) divergent hierarchies between clientelism and contract-intensive economies. In contract-intensive societies, individuals have a loyalty towards the state that enforces the contracts between strangers. As a consequence, individuals in these societies expect that their states enforce contracts reliably and impartially, protect individual rights, and make efforts to enhance the general welfare. Moreover, with the assumption of bounded rationality, individuals routinely dependent on trusting strangers in contracts will develop the habits of trusting strangers and preferring universal rights, impartial law, and liberal democratic government. In contrast, individuals in contract-poor societies will develop the habits of abiding by the commands of group leaders, and distrusting those from out-groups.

According to economic norms theory, the people in contract-rich nations enjoy a permanent and positive peace. As long as their states accede to popular demands and remain reliably impartial, individuals in nations with contract intensive economies have an interest in everyone’s rights and material welfare, within and outside the nation. Consequently, contract-intensive nations not only avoid war with each other but engage in intense levels of mutual cooperation specifically aimed at promoting each other's material welfare. Leaders of nations with contract-poor economies, in contrast, pursue the interests of their dominant groups and have no interest in the security or welfare of members of out-groups, whether they are internal or external to the nation.

===Free capital markets/capital openness===
This theory, originally introduced by [[EriK Gartzke]], [[Quan Li (academic)|Quan Li]], and [[Charles Boehmer]],  argues that nations with a high level of capital openness are able to avoid conflict with each other and maintain a lasting peace. In particular, nations with freer capital markets are more dependent on international investors, because the investors are likely to withdraw if the country is engaged in a war or inter-state conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Erik Gartzke, "The Capitalist Peace," ''American Journal of Political Science'', 51:166-191 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erik Gartzke and J. Joseph Hewitt, "International Crises and the Capitalist Peace," ''International Interactions'', 2010 (forthcoming)&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, leaders of states give greater credibility to threats made by countries with higher levels of capital openness, causing the aforementioned countries to be more peaceful than others by avoiding the possibility of misrepresentation of information. One particular advantage of this theory is that it has been formalized, which helps ensure its internal consistency. The 2007 study performed by Gartzke claimed to make the democratic peace variable insignificant when capital openness was controlled for, but a later re-examination found this study to have several design errors.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Dafoe, "Democracy Still Matters: The Risks of Sample Censoring and Cross-Sectional and Temporal Controls," (2009). Available at www.allandafoe.com/research.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Using measured logged GDP per capita, development correlates with openness to foreign capital at 0.14, slightly higher than trade.&lt;ref&gt;Erik Gartzke, et al., "Investing in the Peace: Economic Interdependence and International Conflict," ''International Organization'', 55:391-438 (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the most recent study&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1080/03050621003784846 | author = Erik Gartzke and J. Joseph Hewitt | year = 2010 | title = International Crises and the Capitalist Peace | url = | journal = International Interactions | volume = 36 | issue = 2| pages = 115–145 }}&lt;/ref&gt; failed to control for the variables of economic norms theory and the size of government explanation.

===Size of government===
The size of government explanation for the capitalist peace relies on the fourth definition of capitalism.  Introduced by [[Patrick J. McDonald]],&lt;ref&gt;Patrick J. McDonald, "The Purse Strings of Peace," ''American Journal of Political Science'', 51:569-582 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1080/03050621003784911 | author = Patrick J. McDonald | year = 2010 | title = Capitalism, Commitment, and Peace | url = | journal = International Interactions | volume = 36 | issue = 2| pages = 146–168 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the idea is that smaller governments are more dependent than larger or socialist governments on raising taxes for fighting wars. This makes the commitments of nations with smaller governments more credible than those with larger ones, allowing for nations with smaller governments, and thus "capitalist" economies, to be better positioned for avoiding conflicts.

===Ruling others by force===
This theory, adduces that if men want to oppose war, it is [[statism]] that they must oppose. So long as they hold the tribal notion that the individual is sacrificial fodder for the collective, that some men have the right to rule others by force, and that some (any) alleged "good" can justify it—there can be no peace within a nation and no peace among nations.&lt;ref&gt;Ayn Rand (1966). "The Roots of War," [[Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal]].&lt;/ref&gt; 
	
==Golden arches theory==

In [[Thomas L. Friedman]]'s 1999 book ''[[The Lexus and the Olive Tree]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Thomas. (2000) ''The Lexus and the Olive Tree''. New York: Anchor Books.&lt;/ref&gt; the following observation was presented: "No two countries that both had McDonald's had fought a war against each other since each got its McDonald's". He supported that observation, as a theory, by stating that when a country has reached an [[economic development]] where it has a [[middle class]] strong enough to support a McDonald's network, it would become a "McDonald's country", and will not be interested in fighting wars anymore.

Shortly after the book was published, [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|NATO bombed Yugoslavia]]. On the first day of the bombing, McDonald's restaurants in [[Belgrade]] were demolished by angry protesters and were rebuilt only after the bombing ended. In the 2000 edition of the book, Friedman argued that this exception proved the rule: the war ended quickly, he argued, partly because the Serbian population did not want to lose their place in a global system "symbolised by McDonald's" (Friedman 2000: 252&amp;ndash;253).

Critics have pointed to two other conflicts fought before 2000 as counterexamples, depending on what one considers "a war":

* The 1989 [[United States invasion of Panama]]
* In 1999, India and Pakistan fought a war over [[Kashmir]], known as the [[Kargil War]]. Both countries had (and continue to have) McDonald's restaurants. Although the war was not fought in all possible theatres (such as Rajasthan and Punjab borders), both countries mobilised their military all along their common borders and both countries made threats involving their nuclear capabilities.

In 2005, Friedman said that he framed this theory in terms of McDonald's [[Golden Arches]] "with [[tongue in cheek|tongue slightly in cheek]]".&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Thomas. (2005) [[The Guardian]], 21 April 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In his 2005 book ''[[The World is Flat]]'' he offered an updated theory he labelled the [[Dell Theory of Conflict Prevention]].

Since 2005, there have been three more conflicts cited as counterexamples:

* The 2006 war between [[Israel]] and [[Lebanon]], following hostilities ongoing since 1973, with [[South Lebanon]] occupied until May 2000. (McDonald's franchises were established in Israel and Lebanon in 1993 and 1998, respectively.) However, the [[Lebanese Armed Forces]] were not a party to the fighting, the Israel Defense Forces action being taken instead against the paramilitary group [[Hezbollah]].
* The [[2008 South Ossetia war]] between [[Russia]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. Both countries had McDonald's at the time (restaurants began in the two countries in 1990 and 1999, respectively).&lt;ref&gt;[http://lefarkins.blogspot.com/2008/08/russia-georgia-and-ir-theory-part-i.html Russia, Georgia, and IR Theory: Part 1], ''Lawyers, Guns, and Money'' (featuring photos of McDonald's in both countries)&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[2014 Crimean crisis]] between Russia and [[Ukraine]]. Both countries had McDonald's at the time.

Friedman's point is that due to [[globalization]], countries that have made strong economic ties with one another have too much to lose to ever go to war with one another. Regardless of whether the statement is true, the conclusions to be drawn are unclear. The global expansion of McDonald's restaurants is a relatively recent phenomenon when put into the context of the [[history of warfare]], and, with a few notable exceptions, has proceeded into relatively stable markets.

==Dell theory==

The '''Dell Theory of Conflict Prevention''', also known as simply the '''Dell Theory''', has been presented by [[Thomas Friedman]] in his book ''[[The World Is Flat]]''. This theory is an updated version of his previous "[[Golden Arches Theory of Conflict Prevention]]".

:"The Dell Theory stipulates: No two countries that are both part of a major global supply chain, like [[Dell]]’s, will ever fight a war against each other as long as they are both part of the same global supply chain."&lt;ref name="Friedman, 421"&gt;''The World is Flat'' ({{ISBN|1-59397-668-2}}), Thomas L. Friedman, pg 421&lt;/ref&gt;

That is, as long as corporations have major [[supply chain]] operations in countries other than that corporation's home country, those countries will never engage in armed conflicts.  This is due to the economic interdependence between nations that arises from a large corporation (such as [[Dell]]) having supply chain operations in multiple global locations and the reluctance of developing nations (in which supply chain operations commonly take place) to give up their newfound wealth.

In his previous book ''[[The Lexus and the Olive Tree]]'', Friedman argued that no two nations with a [[McDonald's]] franchise had ever gone to war with one another: this was known as the [[Golden Arches theory]].  Later, Friedman upgraded that theory into the "Dell Theory of Conflict Prevention" by saying that people or nations don't just want to have a better standard of living as symbolized by McDonald's franchise in their downtown, but want to have the lump of the labour sector that is created by [[globalization]]. That is, developing nations do not want to risk the trust of the multi-national companies who venture into their markets and include them in the global supply chain.

[[Thomas Friedman]] also warns in his book ''[[The World Is Flat]]'' that the Dell Theory should not be interpreted as a guarantee that nations who are deeply involved in global supply chains will not go to war with each other. It rather means that the governments of these nations and their citizens will have very heavy economic costs to consider as they contemplate the possibility of war. These costs include the long-term loss of the country's profitable participation in the global supply chain.

This theory relates with how conflict prevention occurred between [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] in their [[2001–2002 India–Pakistan standoff|2001 - 2002 nuclear standoff]], where India was at risk of losing its global partners. The relationship between the [[People's Republic of China]] and [[Republic of China|Taiwan]] was also cited as an example of this theory - they both have strong supply relations with each other and a war between the two seems very unlikely today.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3184">'''Civil authority''' or '''[[civilian]] authority''', also known as '''civilian government''', is the practical implementation of a [[State (polity)|State]], other than its [[military]] units, that enforces [[law and order (politics)|law and order]]. It is also used to distinguish between religious authority (for example [[Canon law]]) and [[secular]] authority. The enforcement of law and order is typically the role of the [[police]] in modern states.

==History==
Among the first modern experiments in civil government took place in 1636 when [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]], a Christian minister, founded the colony of [[Rhode Island and Providence Plantations]]. He sought to create a "[[Separation of church and state|wall of separation]]" between church and state to prevent corruption of the church and maintain civil order as expounded upon in his 1644 book, ''[[Bloudy Tenent of Persecution]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Williams, James Calvin Davis (editor), ''On religious liberty: selections from the works of Roger Williams'', (Harvard University Press, 2008), {{ISBN|0-674-02685-3}}, {{ISBN|9780674026858}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=1_iNvIgKzfsC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s](accessed July 11, 2009 on Google Books)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James Emanuel Ernst, Roger Williams, ''New England Firebrand'' (Macmillan Co., Rhode Island, 1932), pg. 246 [https://books.google.com/books?id=IsgMAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=bloudy+tenent+of+persecution+vigor+style+roger+williams&amp;dq=bloudy+tenent+of+persecution+vigor+style+roger+williams&amp;pgis=1]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of authority==
Thus three forms of authority may be seen:
*Civil authority
*[[Military government|Military authority]]
*Religious authority (certain constitutions exclude the state having any religious authority)

It can also mean the moral power of command, supported (when need be) by physical coercion, which the State exercises over its members.  In this view, because man can not live in isolation without being deprived of what makes him human, and because authority is necessary for a society to hold together, the authority has not only the power but the right to command.  It is natural to man to live in society, to submit to authority, and to be governed by that custom of society which crystallizes into law, and the obedience that is required is paid to the powers that be, to the authority in possession.  The extent of its authority is bound by the ends it has in view, and the extent to which it provides for the government of society.

In modern states enforcement of law and order is typically the role of the [[police]] although the line between military and civil units may be hard to distinguish; especially when [[militia]]s and volunteers, such as [[yeomanry]], act in pursuance of non-military, domestic objectives.

'''''Clinton v. City of New York''''', 524 U.S. 417 (1998), is a [[legal case]] in which the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ruled that the [[line-item veto]] as granted in the [[Line Item Veto Act of 1996]] violated the [[Presentment Clause]] of the [[United States Constitution]] because it impermissibly gave the [[President of the United States]] the power to unilaterally amend or repeal parts of [[statute]]s that had been duly passed by the [[United States Congress]]. The decision of the Court, in a six-to-three majority, was delivered by Justice [[John Paul Stevens]].

==Background of the case==
The Line Item Veto Act of 1996 allowed the [[President of the United States|president]] to "cancel", that is to void or legally nullify, certain provisions of [[Appropriation (law)|appropriations]] bills, and disallowed the use of funds from canceled provisions for offsetting [[deficit spending]] in other areas.

===Political circumstances===
The 1994 federal [[midterm elections]] signaled a sea-change in [[Politics of the United States|American politics]] known as the [[Republican Revolution]], with the Republican Party taking control of both houses of the U.S. Congress from Democrats. Key to that revolution was the Republicans' [[Contract with America]], which included a list of actions they promised to take if they gained control of Congress. Among this list was the Line Item Veto Act itself, one of two provisions designed to ensure congressional fiscal conservatism. The Act was the only provision of the "Contract with America" that [[Bill Clinton|President Clinton]] supported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Initial litigation===
At its passage, the Act was politically controversial, with many Democrats breaking with Clinton to oppose it. Of the opposition, six members of Congress, including Republican [[Mark Hatfield]], sued to prevent use of the line-item veto. They were granted [[summary judgment]] by the U.S. District Court, but the Supreme Court held that the Congressmen lacked [[Standing (law)|standing]] because they could not show any particularized harm, and dismissed their suit in ''[[Raines v. Byrd]]'', 521 U.S. 811 (1997).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court

In the second case, which was consolidated from two cases by the [[U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia]], the [[New York City|City of New York]] and several organizations related to [[health care]] alleged injury from President Clinton's cancellation of certain provisions of the [[Balanced Budget Act of 1997]] that eliminated certain liabilities, and Snake River Potato Growers, Inc. alleged injury from the President's cancellation of certain provisions of the [[Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997]] that gave [[tax]] benefits to aid farmer's [[cooperative]]s in purchasing potato processing facilities.

The District Court ruled for the plaintiffs, holding that the Line Item Veto Act was unconstitutional. Because the Act established an expedited appeal process for challenges, the case was directly appealed from the District Court to the Supreme Court.

==The Supreme Court's decision==
{{refimprove|section|date=June 2017}}
In a majority opinion written by Justice [[John Paul Stevens]], the Court ruled that because the Act allowed the President to unilaterally amend or repeal parts of duly enacted [[statute]]s by using line-item cancellations, it violated the [[Presentment Clause]] of the Constitution,&lt;ref&gt;[[Article One of the United States Constitution|U.S. Const. art. I]], § 7, cl. 2&lt;/ref&gt; which outlines a specific practice for enacting a statute. The Court construed the silence of the Constitution on the subject of such unilateral Presidential action as equivalent to "an express prohibition", agreeing with historical material that supported the conclusion that statutes may only be enacted "in accord with a single, finely wrought and exhaustively considered, procedure",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court
  |litigants = INS v. Chadha
  |vol = 462
  |reporter = U.S.
  |opinion = 919
  |date = 1983
  |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that a bill must be approved or rejected by the President in its entirety.

===Kennedy's concurrence===
Justice [[Anthony M. Kennedy]], in an [[concurring opinion|opinion concurring]] in the opinion and judgment of the Court, objected to the dissent's argument that the Act did not violate principles of the [[separation of powers under the United States Constitution|separation of powers]] and threaten individual [[liberty]], stating that the "undeniable effects" of the Act were to "enhance the President's power to reward one group and punish another, to help one set of taxpayers and hurt another, to favor one State and ignore another". Kennedy's concurrence implicitly viewed the statute as a violation of the [[nondelegation doctrine]].

===Breyer's dissent===
In a [[dissenting opinion]], Justice [[Stephen Breyer]] contended that the objective of the Act was constitutionally proper and was consistent with powers that the President has held in the past, stating that the Act "does not violate any specific textual constitutional command, nor does it violate any implicit Separation of Powers principle". He extensively refers to many different cases which support the delegation of power by [[United States Congress|the Congress]], and primarily suggests that the Act is an efficient means by which a constitutionally legitimate end may be achieved.

===Scalia's partial concurrence and partial dissent===
In an alternative opinion, Justice [[Antonin Scalia]] objected to the Court's consideration of the case with respect to the Taxpayer Relief Act, finding no party in the case with [[standing (law)|standing]] to challenge it. However, he did find a party with standing to challenge the President's cancellation in the Balanced Budget Act, and concluded that it did not violate the Constitution, because the Congress has the power to delegate the discretionary authority to decline to spend appropriated sums of money, which he asserted was equivalent to cancellation.

==Critical response==

Michael B. Rappaport argued that the original meaning of the Constitution does not apply to certain parts of the [[nondelegation doctrine]], relying on his interpretation of the Executive Power Vesting Clause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In Rappaport’s opinion, "the Court’s approach to cancellation authority has no basis in text, structure and purpose, or precedent".&lt;ref&gt;Rappaport at 290.&lt;/ref&gt;
J.Stephen Kennedy wrote that the majority of the Supreme Court was sufficiently concerned with the constitutional challenges to the line item veto presented to declare the act wholly unconstitutional, instead of relying on other traditional and less sweeping ways of correcting acts of Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

First, it suggests that the Court seems unready or unwilling to alter the existing interpretation of the nondelegation doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;Huefner at 340.&lt;/ref&gt; Second, the Court has shown that it is willing to rely upon alternative rationales to achieve the same result "as would a more robust nondelegation doctrine rationale".&lt;ref name=Huefner /&gt; This approach is significant because in theory, such a rationale could endanger previously accepted delegations to the executive.&lt;ref name=Huefner /&gt;

Roy E. Brownell II criticized the Clinton administration for its exercise of the Line Item Veto Act, charging that it should have restricted its cancellation powers only to statutory provisions that remain in the realm of national security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Brownell suggested that a [[test case]] brought forth on the grounds of national security would have likely acknowledged the existence of "[[National Security Rescission]]", "a narrow [[Statutory interpretation|statutory construction]] limiting the area of presidential cancellation power to within the field of national security. Such a result ... would have assured that the President maintained cancellation authority over a sixth of the federal budget."&lt;ref&gt;Brownell at 1280.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Steven G. Calabresi]] argued that although the Court had denied this, the instant decision was really a "[[Nondelegation doctrine]] case masquerading as a [[bicameralism]] and [[Presentment Clause|presentment case]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Subsequent developments==
Though the Supreme Court struck down the Line Item Veto Act in 1998, President [[George W. Bush]] asked Congress to enact legislation that would return the line item veto power to the Executive. First announcing his intent to seek such legislation in his January 31, 2006 [[State of the Union address]], President Bush sent a legislative proposal [[Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 2006]] to Congress on March 6, 2006, urging its prompt passage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/pubpress/2006/line_item_veto.pdf Proposal for a Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; Senator [[Bill Frist]], Senator [[John McCain]], and Republican Whip Senator [[Mitch McConnell]] jointly introduced this proposal.

On that same day, [[Joshua Bolten]], the Director of the [[Office of Management and Budget]], gave a press conference on the president's line-item veto proposal. Bolten explained that the proposed Act would give the President the ability to single out "wasteful" spending and to put such spending on hold. While the spending line-item is on hold, the President can send legislation to Congress to rescind the particular line-item. The proposal would then be considered in both houses within ten days on an up or down basis, and could be passed by a [[majority|simple majority]]. Additionally, such proposals could not be [[filibuster]]ed.

When asked how this proposed legislation was different from the 1996 Line Item Veto Act that was found unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court, Bolten said that whereas the former act granted unilateral authority to the Executive to disallow specific spending line items, the new proposal would seek Congressional approval of such line-item vetoes. Thus, in order for the President to successfully rescind previously enacted spending, a simple majority of Congress is required to agree to specific legislation to that effect.

Though the newer line-item veto proposal was much weaker than the 1996 version, it nevertheless failed to find strong support in Congress. Senator [[Robert C. Byrd]] of [[West Virginia]] called it "an offensive slap at Congress", asserting that the legislation would enable the president to intimidate individual members of Congress by targeting the projects of his political opponents. He also complained that the line-item veto as proposed would take away Congress' constitutional "[[power of the purse]]" and give it to the [[executive branch]].

On June 8, 2006, [[Viet D. Dinh]], Professor of Law at [[Georgetown University Law Center]], and [[Nathan Sales]], John M. Olin Fellow at Georgetown University Law Center testified by written statement before the [[House Committee on the Budget]] on the constitutional issues in connection with the proposed legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.budget.house.gov/hearings/dinhstmnt060806.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-06-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060628191259/http://www.budget.house.gov/hearings/dinhstmnt060806.htm |archivedate=2006-06-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dinh and Sales argued that the Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 2006 satisfies the Constitution's [[Bicameralism]] and [[Presentment Clause]], and therefore avoids the constitutional issues raised in the 1996 Act struck down by the Supreme Court. They also stated that the proposed Act is consistent with the basic principle that grants Congress broad discretion to establish procedures to govern its internal operations.

The proposed Act was approved by the [[United States House Committee on the Budget|House Budget Committee]] on June 14, 2006 by a vote of 24–9.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The central theme of the book is [[state formation]]. Tilly writes about the complex history of European state formation from the [[Middle Ages]] to the 1990s - a thousand-year time span. While examining political, social, and technological change, Tilly attempts to explain the unprecedented success of the European [[Nation state|nation-state]] as the dominant [[polity]] in the world,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Coercion, Capital, and European States, AD 990-1990|last = Tilly|first = Charles|publisher = B.

== Overview ==
[[File:Jacques Bertaux - Prise du palais des Tuileries - 1793.jpg|thumb|According to Tilly, the [[French Revolution]] unfolded from protests against the high taxes the French rulers imposed to balance for the expensive [[American Revolutionary War|American War]].]]
Tilly asks a double question in ''Coercion, Capital, and European States'', namely: "What accounts for the great variation over time and space in the kinds of states that have prevailed in Europe since AD 990, and why did European states eventually converge on different variants of the national state?"&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

According to Tilly's theory, military innovation in pre-modern Europe, especially the use of gunpowder and mass armies, made war considerably more expensive. In order to continue to fund warfare, conquest, and security, only states with sufficient capital and a large population could afford paying for their security and ultimately surviving in a hostile environment. Those in power were forced to develop a means of extraction by, for example, introducing taxation and conscription.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.so.17.080191.002515|title = Comparative Perspectives on the State|last = Barkey|first = Karen|date = August 1991|journal = Annual Review of Sociology|doi = 10.1146/annurev.so.17.080191.002515|pmid = |access-date = January 25, 2016|first2 = Sunita|last2 = Parikh|issue = 17|pages = 523–549}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, these means of extraction resulted in the creation of state bureaucracies and a centralized state.

The type of state that develops is dependent on the structure of the area. In areas where merchants and capital were the predominant class, city states arose, such as Venice. In areas where independent landlords were the predominant class, centralized absolutism arose, such as Russia. If an area would have both classes more or less equal, a combination of state forms would develop, for example as happened in France and England, according to Tilly. Eventually, all states will develop into the type of state form that Tilly calls the [[nation state]].

With this theory, Tilly questions previous formulations of state development in Europe, arguing that they are unsuccessful in explaining the great variety in kinds of states that have prevailed at different stages of European history since AD 990. He say that they fail "because they locate explanations of state-to-state variation in individual characteristics of states rather than relations among them, and because they assume implicitly a deliberate effect to construct the sorts of substantial, centralized states that come to dominate European life during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Unlike other theories, like the idea of the [[social contract]], Tilly stated that "[w]ar wove the European network of national states, and preparation for war created the internal structures of states within it."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://isnblog.ethz.ch/international-relations/charles-tilly-ad-990-1992-twenty-years-on|title=Charles Tilly, AD 990-1992: Twenty Years On|last=Lindberg|first=Marten|date=November 2011|website=The International Relations and Security Work|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interaction between the rulers on the hand and the manipulators of capital on the other, resulted in three state formations, Tilly argues. These state formations are tribute-taking empires, systems of fragmented sovereignty, and national states.

=== From Militarization to Civilianization ===
Tilly notes a "central paradox" in his theory of European state building: "the pursuit of war and military capacity, after having created national states as a sort of by-product, led to a civilianization of government and domestic politics".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; According to Tilly, this transfer of power from armed forces to civilian entities was not so much a tug-of-war but rather happened incrementally. The ''nature'' of power—coercion—did not change, but the individuals that wielded it did. Tilly provides five main reasons for this incremental transition (p.&amp;nbsp;206):
# The building up and maintenance of military forces required massive extractive structures that were run by civilians, eventually forming a counterweight to the same military forces;
# War making forced states to legitimize civilian input since it had to bargain for necessary resources with civilian entities;
# War making dramatically expanded the state and did not downsize its capacities at the end of conflicts;
# Individuals involved in war making were promised dues at the end of the war, and thus legitimately claimed their dues at demobilization;
# Borrowing during conflicts led to bureaucracies being created to service the skyrocketing state debts, which in turn encouraged states to intervene in the local economy.

=== State Building in the Developing World ===
[[Jeffrey Herbst]] is an example of a scholar that builds on Tilly's theory. Herbst explains the relative failure of state building in Africa by the lack of external threats that forced European leaders to concentrate capital and power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = War and the State in Africa|jstor = 2538753|journal = International Security|date = 1990-01-01|pages = 117–139|volume = 14|issue = 4|doi = 10.2307/2538753|first = Jeffrey|last = Herbst}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tilly concludes his book, however, emphasizing caution in applying his model to contemporary [[state-building]]. the Tilly argues that the militarization of politics in many developing countries should not be understood as a step towards the development of a stable nation state. He asserts that current conditions of state formation today (at the time of writing, in 1990) are vastly different from what they were in Europe over his study period. First, Tilly notes that the military apparatus in developing countries today is not generally concerned with conquering or defending territory, as opposed to European armies (p.&amp;nbsp;207). Thus, they turn their full capacity to internal control, so that the objective is not to control territory but populations. Second, Tilly writes that the Cold War has led to a competition between the United States and the Soviet Union to arm, fund and control developing countries, especially their militaries. Thus, military groups thrived as other organizations withered. Progressively, the military was better able to control the state, whereas civilian organizations could not rival its strength. In other words, Tilly argues that the military groups that run contemporary developing states have little in common with their European counterparts.

He further proposes three hypothesis to start to theorize the lack of civilianization in developing countries (p.&amp;nbsp;220):
# Failure of civilian institutions that lead to military intervention;
# Disproportionate external support for the military;
# No institutional tool to bargain and contain the military since it is artificially funded externally.
Tilly's main claim is thus that the European nation-state as it was constructed is certainly not a ''de facto'' endgame, or ideal polity model. In fact, Tilly argues that it is improbable that current Third World states follow exactly the same processus of state building- and we should not expect them to do so.

=== Academic discussion ===

==== Tarrow, 2008 ====
American sociologist [[Sidney Tarrow]] discussed the book during a 2008 conference organized by the [[Social Science Research Council]] in honor of Charles Tilly. During his talk, he addressed what he saw as four gaps in the book:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
# '''The scope conditions of Tilly's theory'''. War is seen by Tilly as the "prime mover of early modern European state-making, because its requisites led to processes of extraction, protection, production, and distribution."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, Tarrow wonders how that can explain non-European states and states that formed more recently, such as post-colonial states. There is a lot of literature on "correcting Tilly" on state-building in the [[North–South divide|global South]] and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-2486.2008.00746.x/abstract|title = Tilly Tally: War-Making and State-Making in the Contemporary Third World|last = Taylor|first = Brian D.|date = March 2008|journal = International Studies Review|doi = 10.1111/j.1468-2486.2008.00746.x|pmid = |access-date = January 25, 2016|last2 = Botea|first2 = Roxana|issue = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''The theory's internal validity'''. In the 1975 book ''The Formation of National States in Western Europe'', Tilly critiques [[Joseph Strayer]]'s model of state formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = On the Medieval Origins of the Modern State|last = Strayer|first = Joesph R.|publisher = Princeton University Press|year = 1970|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in ''Coercion, Capital, and European States'', "the successful cases looked remarkably like Strayer's model."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
# '''There is no attention for the role of religion and capitalism in European state development''', while Tarrow argues "[w]e know how deeply Catholic/Protestant conflicts divided Europe in the [[Thirty Years' War|Thirty Year's War]], and how the settlement of that conflict produced the European state system after the [[Peace of Westphalia|Treaty of Westphalia]]." Concerning capitalism, Tarrow said that "not all European states were equally in need of domestic capital to finance their wars", referring to Sweden under King [[Gustav III of Sweden|Gustav III]]. 
# '''The role of rights in state development in the United States''', characterized by the so-called "[[War on Terrorism – Timeline|War on Terror]]". According to Tarrow, Tilly "saw his country at risk of abandoning its devotion to its regime of rights."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Leander, 2012 ====
French/Swedish sociologist [[Anna Leander]] examined Tilly's relevance twenty years later in her article ''Wars and the Un-Making of States: Taking Tilly Seriously in the Contemporary World''. Leander argues that the "war makes states"  no longer holds for four reasons:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.peacepalacelibrary.nl/ebooks/files/338105247.pdf|title = Wars and the Un-Making of States: Taking Tilly Seriously in the Contemporary World|last = Leander|first = Anna|date = 2012|journal = |doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''[[State-building]]'''. While rulers' competition for controlling coercion is a crucial element of Tilly's hypothesis, today's rulers "take increasingly minor roles in the organization of coercion".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; State-building is not a product of interstate conflict anymore but rather of diplomacy and high-politics.
# '''Privatization of coercion'''. Another crucial element - the rulers' monopoly on legitimate violence - is disappearing. Europe and North America have seen a growth of 10 per cent per years in private security companies taking over the state prerogatives since the 1970s, a ''[[Peace Research Institute Frankfurt]]'' report shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Private Security Companies and the State Monopoly on Violence|url = http://www.isn.ethz.ch/Digital-Library/Publications/Detail/?id=113632|website = www.isn.ethz.ch|access-date = 2016-01-25|first = ISN|last = Editors}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Privatization of capital'''. Just like coercion, controlling capital is a crucial element in Tilly's hypothesis, as wars are expensive. However, national economics is a function of international economics and subject to international norms, rules, and regulations in the modern world.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 
# '''Different interest groups'''. Tilly concludes that the civilianization of government evolved through the bargaining between rulers and their citizens. However, "the privatization of coercion and capital and the decentralization of political power has left rulers as brokers between different [...] interest groups rather than ''ruling them'' from a national center".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== 1992 Edition ==
A revised edition of the book was published in 1992 with the title ''Coercion, Capital, and European States AD 990-1992''. For that edition, Tilly made minor revisions throughout the book and added an extra section discussing the rapid changes in Central and Eastern Europe after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35993">'''Dual federalism''', also known as '''layer-cake federalism''' or '''divided sovereignty''', is a political arrangement in which power is divided between the federal and state governments in clearly defined terms, with state governments exercising those powers accorded to them without interference from the federal government.  Dual federalism is defined in contrast to [[cooperative federalism]] ("marble-cake federalism"), in which federal and state governments collaborate on policy.

==United States==

===Constitutional origin===

The system of dual/joint federalism in the United States is a product of the backlash against the [[Articles of Confederation]], ratified in 1781, which established a very weak federal government with the powers to declare war, make treaties, and maintain an army.&lt;ref name="Sig Events"&gt;{{cite web|last=Boyd|first=Eugene|title=American Federalism, 1776 to 2000: Significant Events|url=http://congressional.proquest.com/congressional/docview/t21.d22.crs-2000-gvf-0129|publisher=Congressional Research Service|accessdate=25 March 2013|author2=Michael K. Fauntroy|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Articles of Confederation : March 1, 1781. The Avalon Project. http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/artconf.asp&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lowi 26-27"&gt;Lowi, et al. (2012) American Government: Power and Purpose -- Brief Twelfth Edition.  W.W. Norton and Company p.26-27&lt;/ref&gt; Fueled by [[Shays' Rebellion]] and an economy faltering under the inability of the federal government to pay the debt from the [[American Revolution]], a group later known as the [[Federalist Party|Federalists]] generated support for a strong central government and called for a [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] in 1787 to reconsider the Articles.

In 1787, the Convention almost immediately dropped its original purpose of editing the Articles and instead drafted a new [[Constitution of the United States]]. Rejecting both [[Confederation|confederal]] and [[Unitary State|unitary systems]], they based the new American government on a new theory of federalism, a system of shared sovereignty that delegates some powers to the federal government and reserves other powers for the states.&lt;ref name="Katz"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Katz|first=Ellis|title=American Federalism, Past, Present, and Future|journal=The U.S. Information Service's Electronic Journal|date=April 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=James Q.|title=American Government Institutions and Policies|year=1995|publisher=Heath and Company|location=Lexington, D.C.|page=A-49|author2=John J. DiIulio Jr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Among other powers, the federal [[legislature]] could now [[tax]] citizens and maintain a standing military, and had exclusive power over regulating [[interstate commerce]] and coining currency.&lt;ref name="Lowi 26-27" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lowi, et al. (2012) American Government: Power and Purpose -- Brief Twelfth Edition.  W.W. Norton and Company p.33&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, while [[Article Six of the United States Constitution|Article Six]] of the Constitution stipulated that federal law in pursuit of constitutionally assigned ends overrode any contradictory state law, the power of the national government was held in check by the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] – particularly the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth Amendment]], which limited federal governmental powers to only those specified in the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;"The Bill of Rights: A Transcription" https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/bill_of_rights_transcript.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Importantly, at the Convention, there was large debate over the structure of the [[United States Congress|legislative branch]], eventually solved by the [[Connecticut Compromise]]. In the traditional understanding of the discussion, the larger states proposed the [[Virginia Plan]], which allocated representation to each state proportional to its population. The smaller states, fearing a tyranny of the larger states, propose the [[New Jersey Plan]], which gave each state equal representation in the legislative body. The states' motives for such a debate have been largely understood as a method for ensuring a strong voice in the federal government so as to maintain a desired degree of sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Turner Main|first=Jackson|title=The Antifederalists; Critics of the Constitution, 1781-1788|year=2004|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill, NC|isbn=978-0807855447}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, political scientist Martin Diamond interprets the argument through a [[federalist]] vs [[antifederalist]] lens, discounting the question of state size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Diamond|first=Martin|title=A Nation of States|year=1963|publisher=Rand McNally &amp; Co.|location=Chicago|editor=Robert A. Goldwin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, he argues that the pure federalism of the New Jersey Plan and the pure nationalism of the Virginia Plan eventually came together to form the system of [[bicameralism]] that the framers settled on. However, his theory largely goes against the usual understanding, which some have argued is based on stronger historical evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wolfe|first=Christopher|title=On Understanding the Constitutional Convention of 1787|journal=The Journal of Politics|date=Feb 1977|volume=39|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th-century Supreme Court cases===

Since the initial division of state and federal powers – collectively, the system of dual federalism – put forth by the Constitution, several seminal court cases have helped further clarify the purview of the federal government.  One such case, ''[[McCulloch v. Maryland]]'', concerned the constitutionality of a federally chartered bank, which bankers and many legislators in Maryland opposed.&lt;ref name="McBride" /&gt;  Although the ability to charter a bank had not been explicitly granted to the federal government in the Constitution, federalist proponents argued such action as necessary for the federal government to exercise its constitutional power to “tax, borrow, and regulate interstate commerce.”&lt;ref name="McBride" /&gt;  The Supreme Court, in essence, backed Alexander Hamilton's interpretation of the Constitution over Thomas Jefferson&lt;ref&gt;Smith, K. and Greenblatt, A. (2016). 6th Edition. ''Governing States and Localities''. Los Angeles. CQ Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. Thus, the banks legitimacy was ensured by the [[Necessary and Proper Clause]].&lt;ref name="McBride"&gt;McBride, Alex "Landmark Cases: McCulloch v Maryland" PBS https://www.pbs.org/wnet/supremecourt/antebellum/landmark_mcculloch.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A second major case regarding the respective rights of the state and federal government was ''[[Gibbons v. Ogden]]'' (1824).  In 1808, the Fulton-Livingston Company had been granted exclusive steamboat rights by the New York legislature, who in turn had leased ferry rights within a portion of New York to Aaron Ogden.  Ogden, citing the [[monopoly]] granted to him by the Fulton-Livingstone Company, had successfully prevented Thomas Gibbons from operating a ferry service between Manhattan and New Jersey.&lt;ref name="Shallat" /&gt;  Chief Justice Marshall’s majority opinion sided with Gibbons, stating that Ogden's monopoly of the ferry service overstepped states’ ability to regulate trade.  While the constitutionality of some aspects implied by the case remained vague, the decision once more reaffirmed the supremacy of federal law and diminished the power of state-sanctioned [[protectionism]].&lt;ref name="Shallat"&gt;Shallat, Todd "Water and Bureaucracy: Origins of the Federal Responsibility for Water Resources, 1787-1838" (1992). Natural Resources Journal. p. 14 {{cite web |url=http://lawlibrary.unm.edu/nrj/32/1/02_shallat_water.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202101555/http://lawlibrary.unm.edu/nrj/32/1/02_shallat_water.pdf |archivedate=2014-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===State challenges to federal supremacy===

In the decades before the Civil War, both Northern and Southern states clashed with the national government over perceived overreaches in its power.  These conflicts struck at the heart of dual federalism, and reflected a fundamental disagreement about the division of power between the national and state levels.&lt;ref name="Civil War Trust"&gt;"States' Rights: The Rallying Cry of Secession." (n.d.) Civil War Trust http://www.civilwar.org/education/history/civil-war-overview/statesrights.html&lt;/ref&gt; While these political battles were ostensibly solved either through legislative compromise or Supreme Court decisions, the underlying tensions and disagreements about states’ rights would later help [[Origins of the American Civil War|set the stage for the Civil War]].

In 1828, the so-called “[[Tariff of Abominations]]” passed the U.S. House.&lt;ref&gt;South Carolina Ordinance of Nullification, November 24, 1832. The Avalon Project http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/ordnull.asp&lt;/ref&gt; It was meant as a protectionist measure to help the relatively industrialized New England states against international products, but this had grave implications for the largely agrarian South.&lt;ref name="Pierson"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pierson | first1 = P | year = 2009 | title = South Carolina takes on the feds | url = http://search.proquest.com/docview/223364035 | journal = America's Civil War | volume = 22 | issue = | pages = 23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In protest and spearheaded by Vice President John Calhoun, South Carolina formulated a ‘[[Nullification (U.S. Constitution)|Nullification Doctrine]]’, in effect claiming a state’s ability to ignore federal law, and rejected the tariff.&lt;ref&gt;"Historical Highlights: The Tariff of Abominations" U.S. House of Representatives http://history.house.gov/Historical-Highlights/1800-1850/The-Tariff-of-Abominations/&lt;/ref&gt;  The situation became especially serious when President Jackson ordered federal troops into Charleston, though crisis was averted by the drafting of a new tariff to which both sides agreed.&lt;ref name="Pierson" /&gt;  The crisis illustrated an example of conflicting ideologies on state and federal power that was not resolved through the courts, but with discussion between elected officials.

====''Prigg v Pennsylvania''====
While some Southern states resisted economic actions of the federal government, several Northern states balked at federal requirements regarding slavery.  In 1842, the case of ''[[Prigg v. Pennsylvania]]'' concerned Edward Prigg, who had been found guilty of kidnapping a former slave residing in Pennsylvania, Margaret Morgan, and her children and bringing them to her former owner in Maryland.  Prigg was charged according to Pennsylvania law, which considered such an action a felony, while Prigg argued that he had been duly appointed for the task and was within the bounds of the federal [[Fugitive Slave Act#Fugitive Slave Act of 1793|Fugitive Slave Act of 1793]].&lt;ref name="Prigg"&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Prigg v. Pennsylvania |vol=41 |reporter=U.S. |opinion=539 |date=1842 |url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/41/539/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Supreme Court declared the Pennsylvania law unconstitutional, striking the abolitionist law and heightening tensions between slaveholding and non-slaveholding states.&lt;ref&gt;"Majority Rules: Prigg v Pennsylvania" PBS https://www.pbs.org/wnet/supremecourt/antebellum/majority1b.html?no&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nullification by Wisconsin====
A similar situation arose when, in 1854, the state Supreme Court of Wisconsin declared the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;"Unconstitutionality of the Fugitive slave act" (1854) Supreme Court of the State of Wisconsin http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/llst:@field(DOCID+@lit(llst026div4)):&lt;/ref&gt;  The U.S. Supreme Court overturned the Wisconsin Supreme Court while the Wisconsin legislature, echoing the rhetoric of South Carolina during the 1828 crisis, nullified the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision.&lt;ref name="Boyd"/&gt;

====''Dred Scott v Sandford (1857)''====
In 1857, continuing the debate between the national government and free states, the case of ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'' held that all Americans of African descent were not legally citizens, and therefore could not file suit. Thus Mr. Scott, a slave who had been brought to the free state of Illinois but later returned to slave-holding jurisdictions, and who had pursued emancipation through the federal courts, remained a slave.&lt;ref&gt;The Dred Scott decision: opinion of Chief Justice Taney (1856) Supreme Court of the United States http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/llst:@field(DOCID+@lit(llst022div3))&lt;/ref&gt;  Though the decision was largely welcomed in the South, the decision outraged abolitionists and non-slaveholding states as another affront on [[states’ rights]].&lt;ref&gt;People &amp; Events: Dred Scott's fight for freedom. (n.d.) PBS https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part4/4p2932.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Federal power during the Civil War===
The Civil War brought to a head many of the fundamental disagreements concerning the extent of state and federal powers which presidential candidates Lincoln and Douglas had [[Lincoln–Douglas debates|debated between 1858 and 1860]].&lt;ref&gt;Johannsen, Robert W. "The Lincoln-Douglas Debates" (1991) The Reader's Companion to American History. http://www.history.com/topics/lincoln-douglas-debates&lt;/ref&gt; Douglas, an advocate of federal government limited by a strict interpretation of the Constitution, championed the vision of America as “the confederation of the sovereign states".&lt;ref name="Les Benedict"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Les Benedict | first1 = Michael | year = 1988 | title = Abraham Lincoln and Federalism | url = http://quod.lib.umich.edu/j/jala/2629860.0010.103? | journal = Journal of the Abraham Lincoln Association | volume = 10 | issue = | page = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lincoln, meanwhile, envisioned a more active federal government and more integrated national community, with the purview of states limited to only "those things that pertain exclusively to themselves—that are local in their nature, that have no connection with the general government".&lt;ref name="Les Benedict" /&gt;   Many of these questions would be resolved by actions taken by the North’s federal government during the course of the fighting during the years after the debates.&lt;ref name="Sheldon" /&gt;  Actions taken by the North during the war, including the conscription of soldiers into a national army, as provided by the Enrollment Act of March 1863, and expanded federal control over banking with the 1863 National Banking Act, resulting in a much more robust national government in postbellum America.&lt;ref name="Sheldon"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shelden | first1 = R. A. | year = 2009 | title = Measures for a "speedy conclusion": A reexamination of conscription and civil war federalism | url = http://search.proquest.com/docview/519665491 | journal = Civil War History | volume = 55 | issue = 4| pages = 469–498 [440] | doi=10.1353/cwh.0.0092}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There exists debate over whether this increase in federal power was achieved against states’ will or whether such expanded powers were granted by the states.&lt;ref name="Sheldon" /&gt;

After the Civil War, the federal government began expanding its powers, primarily concerning itself with regulating commerce and civil rights, originally considered the domain of state governments.&lt;ref name="Boyd"&gt;Boyd, Eugene; Michael K. Fauntroy (2000). "American Federalism, 1776 to 2000: Significant Events". Congressional Research Service.http://congressional.proquest.com/congressional/docview/t21.d22.crs-2000-gvf-0129&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reconstruction===
After the Civil War, Congress amended the Constitution to guarantee certain rights for citizens.  This period brought about debate on whether the federal government could make these amendments, some arguing that this was an infringement on states' rights.&lt;ref&gt;Gressman, Eugene. "The Unhappy History of Civil Rights Legislation." 50 Mich. L. Rev. 1323 (1951-1952) http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/mlr50&amp;g_sent=1&amp;collection=journals&amp;id=1337&lt;/ref&gt;  However, during this time period the public began to believe that the federal government was responsible for defending civil liberties even though previously the idea was that a strong central government would be the biggest detriment to personal freedom. Regardless, the Supreme Court verified states' rights to require literacy tests in ''[[Williams v. Mississippi]]'', effectively allowing states to discriminate against black voters.  In addition, the Court ruled in favor of states' rights to mandate racially segregated accommodations, so long as they were "separate but equal" in ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]''.

Although Law Professor Eugene Gressman views these rulings as a "judicially directed perversion"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/mlr50&amp;g_sent=1&amp;collection=journals&amp;id=1337 | title=Redirecting}}&lt;/ref&gt; of what the abolitionists meant to accomplish, within historical context the Supreme Court decisions seem more occupied with sustaining the system of dual federalism.  In making these decisions, the Supreme Court aimed to keep in line with the idea of federalism as it then existed, balancing states' rights with the protection of civil liberties, rather than simply opposing the new amendments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Benedict | first1 = Michael Les | year = 1978 | title = Preserving Federalism: Reconstruction and the Waite Court | journal = The Supreme Court Review | volume = 1978 | issue = | pages = 39–79 | jstor=3109529}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For instance, in ''[[Strauder v. West Virginia]]'' the Court sided with those who wished to overturn the law that excluded black citizens from juries, which suggests that the Court was beginning to build a set of cases that enumerated rights based on the new amendments&lt;ref&gt;William N. Eskridge, Jr. and John Ferejohn. "The Elastic Commerce Clause: A Political Theory of American Federalism" 47 Vand. L. Rev. 1355 http://www.lexisnexis.com/lnacui2api/api/version1/getDocCui?lni=3S0M-D8W0-00CW-70BH&amp;csi=7362&amp;hl=t&amp;hv=t&amp;hnsd=f&amp;hns=t&amp;hgn=t&amp;oc=00240&amp;perma=true&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in other aspects the Supreme Court reasserted states' rights in relation to the 14th Amendment in particular.  In the [[Slaughter-house cases]] and ''[[Bradwell v. Illinois]]'' the Court supported the view that the amendment regulated states rather than individuals practicing discrimination.&lt;ref name="Spackman"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Spackman | first1 = S.G.F. | year = 1976 | title = American Federalism and the Civil Rights Act of 1875 | journal = Journal of American Studies | volume = 10 | issue = 3| pages = 313–328 | jstor=27553250 | doi=10.1017/s0021875800003182}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both of these cases allowed states to enforce laws that infringed on individual rights.

===End of dual federalism===
[[File:National Labor Relations Act2.jpg|thumb|Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal policies signaled the end of dual federalism]] The general consensus among scholars is that dual federalism ended during [[Franklin Roosevelt]]’s presidency in 1937&lt;ref name="b"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Staten|first=Clifford|title=Theodore Roosevelt: Dual and Cooperative Federalism|journal=Presidential Studies Quarterly|year=1993|volume=23|issue=1|jstor=27551084}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="c"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zackin|first=Emily|title=What's Happened to American Federalism?|journal=Polity|date=July 2011|volume=43|issue=3|pages=388–403|url=http://search.proquest.com/wpsa/docview/872755068/abstract|doi=10.1057/pol.2011.4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="d"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Williams|first=Norman|title=The Commerce Clause and the Myth of Dual Federalism|journal=UCLA Law Review|date=August 2007|url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/hottopics/lnacademic/?verb=sr&amp;csi=7359&amp;sr=TITLE(THE+COMMERCE+CLAUSE+AND+THE+MYTH+OF+DUAL+FEDERALISM.)+and+date+is+August+1%2C+2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="e"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zimmerman|first=Joseph|title=National-State Relations: Cooperative Federalism in the Twentieth Century|journal=Publius|year=2001|volume=31|url=http://publius.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/crossref-forward-links/31/2/15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="f"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shapiro|first=Robert|title=INTERACTIVE FEDERALISM: FILLING THE GAPS?

However, political scientists have argued different theories concerning the end of dual federalism. As opposed to a clear transition from dual federalism to cooperative federalism, some political scientists say there was a much more complicated relationship between the states and the federal government. Rather than a competition for power, the powers of the state and federal government change according to national political movements and their agendas; a dynamic that existed both before and after the New Deal.&lt;ref name="c"/&gt;&lt;ref name="j"&gt;{{cite book|last=Feeley|first=Malcolm|title=Federalism: Political Identity and Tragic Compromise|year=2008|publisher=University of Michigan Press|location=Ann Arbor|author2=Rubin, Edward}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="k"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nugent|first=John|title=Safeguarding Federalism: How States Protect Their Interests in National Policymaking.|year=2009|publisher=Norman: University of Oklahoma Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="l"&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Kimberley|title=Governing the American State: Congress and the New Federalism, 1877–1929, Princeton Studies in American Politics.|year=2007|publisher=Princeton: Princeton University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="m"&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Robert|title=The Law of American State Constitutions.|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other political scientists see dual federalism ending much earlier than the New Deal; This would have been the beginning of cooperative federalism as the federal government identified a problem, set up the basic outline of the program to address the problem, and make money available to fund that program, and then turning over much of the responsibility for implementing and running the program to the states and localities. &lt;ref&gt;Smith, K. and Greenblatt, A.

Constitutions with delegations of broad powers to the state level of government that resemble the [[Constitution of the United States]] include the [[Constitution of Australia]] and the [[Constitution of Canada]].

==Origins of "layer cake" metaphor==
In his second term, President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] organized the [[Commission on National Goals]] to broadly outline national objectives. Included in their 1960 report ''Goals for Americans: The Report of the President's Commission on National Goals'' was "The Federal System", a report by political scientist [[Morton Grodzins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grodzins|first=Morton|title=The Federal System, from Goals for Americans: The Report of the President's Commission on National Goals|year=1960|url=http://ssihs.wikispaces.com/file/view/The+Federal+System+(5).pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=U.S. President's Commission on National Goals, Records, 1959-1961|year=1966|location=Abilene, Kansas|url=https://www.eisenhower.archives.gov/research/finding_aids/pdf/US_Presidents_Commission_on_National_Goals.pdf|editor=William G. Lewis}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this report, Grodzins first coined the terms "layer cake federalism" and "marble cake federalism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ashbee|first=Edward|title=US politics today|year=2004|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=Manchester|isbn=978-0719068195|page=160|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nathan|first=Richard P.|title=Updating Theories of American Federalism|url=http://www.rockinst.org/pdf/federalism/2006-09-02-updating_theories_of_american_federalism.pdf|accessdate=20 March 2013|date=September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He used the metaphor of a layer cake to describe the system of dual federalism, the separated layers of the cake symbolizing how distinct spheres of power that the state and federal governments inhabited. He contrasted this with marble cake, which he saw as descriptive of federalism's status in 1960, the swirling indistinct boundaries of the cake symbolizing the overlapping and concurrent duties of the state and federal governments.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11203">'''Elite capture''' is a form of corruption whereby public resources are biased for the benefit of a few individuals of superior social status in detriment to the welfare of the larger population.  Elites are groups of individuals who, because of self-ratifying factors such as social class, asset ownership, religious affiliations, political power, historic discrimination among social groups, political party affiliation,  or economic position, have decision-making power in processes of public concern. This specific form of corruption occurs when elites use public funds, originally intended to be invested in services that benefit the larger population, to fund projects that would only benefit them. This differentiates elite capture from embezzlement, misappropriation or other diversion of funds by a public official. 
Elite capture is related to information asymmetry, inefficient regulation or inefficient allocation of resources because it causes a biased distribution of a public good or a service, resulting a situation wherein certain segments of the population experience reduced access to these public goods.  In this context, as long as there is elite capture, the welfare impact will not be Pareto Optimal nor equitable.

==Elite Capture in Decentralization==
For long it was thought that creating decentralized governments would avoid the limitations of a single planner in society. A centralized government often lacks knowledge and might be subject of intense lobbying, leaving certain territories unattended. On the other hand, theory predicts that when people are involved in governing and have representation in decision making, public spending is supposed to be more efficient, more equitable and more sustainable. However, despite the theoretical predictions, the outcomes of many development projects in decentralized governments have not met these expectations.
By yielding power to smaller units, money should be more efficiently distributed, but local governments are more vulnerable to pressure groups. Failure can occur when particular subgroups of the community are able to mobilize resources to further their own self-interest at the expense of the broader community. Local governments are even more vulnerable to capture by local elites than national governments.
Attempts to reduce elite capture in decentralized governments range from going back to a heavily centralized planner to providing citizens with funds to initiate projects. This last option has been criticized because the citizens’ ability and skills to actually implement programs may be weaker than that of local leaders.  
According to the World Bank, development assistance is vulnerable to manipulation or hijack by elites, independently of the form that the assistance may take, because such aid it requires governmental or private agency to ensure transfer to households. It is in this intermediary stage where instances of elite capture are most common. Be it centralized or decentralized government, there is a risk of ineffective public resource delivery involved, where part of the local population will receive more than the rest of the local population. This situation has welfare consequences. 

==Alternative solutions==
First, elite capture of public resources by local elites can be relatively lessened by the presence of media to balance the asymmetry of information. Empirical studies have shown that government responsiveness and accountability to ensure equal distribution of public goods and avoid elite capture is related to the availability of information and general levels of awareness among the local population.
Second, the ‘counter-elite’ approach to deal with elite capture advocates challenging elites by completely excluding them in the implementation of projects. It assumes that all elites are inherently bad. By raising public awareness of power inequalities and building local capacity, this approach suggests that community empowerment and political citizenship would be effective in resisting elite domination. This approach is not necessarily effective in challenging elite domination, due to structural dependence of poor people on elites and the weakening of established institutions.
Third, the ‘co-opt-elite’ approach suggests that cooperation with elites, rather than confrontation, is the solution to alleviating poverty. It asserts that not all elites are bad, and some of them can play a constructive role in community development. It also assumes a pragmatic use of elites’ networks and resources can benefit poor communities.  The ‘counter-elite’ approach is not necessarily effective in eroding elite power, and also risks legitimizing the authority of the elites and worsening inequality.

'''Similar Concepts'''
Elite capture and discrimination are very similar concepts because both imply unequal power status and denial of public resources. Social discrimination can promote elite capture, but is not an interchangable concept. Elite capture is based on a state of an unequal power relations, whereas discrimination may or may not be the cause of an unequal distribution of power. Elite capture is a changing and dynamic process, and power structures change with it when a new elite arises. Discrimination is rather static in this sense. Elite capture is a manifested form of corruption, and social discrimination is a manifestation of a set of beliefs in a society. 
Elite capture and state capture are also similar because they are both related to deviation of public resources for private benefits, but differ in how power is exercised. Elite capture is carried out by an elite that is legitimately entitled some level of de jure power. State capture is carried out by elites that exercise de facto power (e.g. powerful unions or big multinational companies) that aim to have influence on the decision making process of the institutions. However, both phenomena are both symptommatic of and a main reason for bad governance because they promote a vicious cycle, with long-term effects on institutional and bureaucratic performance.

==Examples==
 
An example of elite capture in the United States is to be found in the literature on the subject of iron triangles, wherein special interests are able to achieve disproportionately favorable outcomes from  congressional committees and federal regulators. Oftentimes, personnel between each side of the iron triangle is interchangeable, a revolving door dynamic which is favorable to the development of capture of regulators by the entities they are supposed to oversee. 
Also, examples are found in most developing countries, where an increasing proportion of government and foreign aid is distributed through community driven development but fail to properly reach the target population. 
Additional examples are male-dominated cultures where women may be disproportionately influenced by elite capture, since they tend to be excluded from the social elect and public services.
It is a phenomenon that may even take place even where there is no clear indicators of ‘capture’ of power or corruption like access to education in rural areas of developing countries. While there are primary schools in the villages, they are somewhat dysfunctional due to lack of maintenance. As a result, children have to go to neighboring villages to study. Usually girls are not sent far away from their villages, limiting their study years. Therefore, girls are systematically denied access to a public resource (education) as opposed to boys in the same village. 
The absence of an enabling social, political and economic environment can also encourage unintended elite capture. But at the same time, corruption and inefficiency appear to be a concomitant part of the elite capture problem.
Academic Approaches
As many other activities related to corruption, there has been very few systematic attempts to measure and identify causes and consequences of this phenomenon in economy. The concept itself is still in constant evolution because majority of evidence comes from non-experimental case studies or empirical data sets and there is very little consensus on the outcomes. 
A formal representation of the level of elite capture can be done by considering a single public service and how much does the elite capture changes the per-capita enjoyment of if it was equitably distributed. The idea is to consider how different the average consumption level of a certain public program would be if the average formal elites were eliminated. Empirical studies often analyze total welfare and utility function of a society. The idea is to identifying utility function of all households in three scenarios: current unequal distribution situation, with probability of equitable distributions and unavailability the public service or good to finally compare the data.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19733">{{History of the Jews in England}}
The '''Emancipation of the Jews in the United Kingdom''' was the culmination in the 19th century of efforts over several hundred years to loosen the legal restrictions set in place on [[History of the Jews in England|England's Jewish]] population. The nation's mercantile class had long recognised Jews as an economic asset, and they and their allies in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] sought and eventually won the passage of laws that placed male Jews in the United Kingdom on an equal legal footing with the kingdom's other emancipated males.

==Freedom for Catholics bodes well for Jews==
When in 1829 the [[Roman Catholic]]s of the United Kingdom were freed from all their [[civil disabilities]], the hopes of the Jews rose high; and the first step toward a similar alleviation in their case was taken in 1830 when [[William Huskisson]] presented a petition signed by 2,000 merchants and others of [[Liverpool]]. This was immediately followed by a bill presented by [[Robert Grant (MP)|Robert Grant]] on 15 April that year which was destined to engage the British [[legislature]] in one form or another for the next thirty years. [[Thomas Macaulay]], later a well-known and influential historian, was elected to Parliament in 1830 and – among other issues he took up – distinguished himself by attacking the exclusion of Jews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libertystory.net/LSDOCMACAULAYJEWS.htm Macaulay's speech on the exclusion of Jews from parliament]&lt;/ref&gt;

At first the bill failed to get through the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]. Against the opposition of [[Sir Robert Inglis, 2nd Baronet|Sir Robert Inglis]], the first reading was passed by 115 to 97 votes. But the second reading, on 17 May, notwithstanding a sizable petition in its favour from 14,000 citizens of London, was rejected by 265 to 228 votes. The next year, 1833, however, it passed its third reading in the Commons on 22 July by a majority of 189 to 52, and was read for the first time in the [[House of Lords|Lords]]. On the second reading in the Lords on 1 August it was rejected by 104 to 54, with the [[Duke of Wellington]] speaking and voting against the Bill, though the [[Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex|Duke of Sussex]], a constant friend to the Jews, presented a petition in its favour signed by 1,000 distinguished citizens of [[Westminster]]. The same thing happened in 1834, the bill being lost in the House of Lords by a majority of 92 votes. The whole force of the Tory Party and the personal antagonism of King [[William IV of England|William IV]] was against the bill. In the following year it was deemed inadvisable{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} to make the annual appeal to [[British Parliament|Parliament]], as the battle for religious liberty was going on in another part of the field{{Vague|date=November 2015}}; but by the passing of the [[Sheriffs' Declaration Act]]{{Dubious |Transferring accuracy challenge from hidden comment to talk page |reason=Hidden comment on page asserts that there is no such act and the link is a redlink |date=November 2015}} on 21 August 1835, Jews were allowed to hold the ancient and important office of sheriff.{{fact|date=April 2014}} In the following year the [[Jew Bill]] was introduced late in the session, and succeeded in passing its first reading in the Lords on 19 August but was then dropped owing to the lateness of the session.

==Membership of parliament==
[[Benjamin Disraeli, 1st Earl of Beaconsfield|Benjamin Disraeli]], who was born Jewish and  baptised aged 12 into the [[Church of England]], was a member of parliament from 1837, served as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] in 1852, 1858–1859 and 1867–1868 [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] governments. He went on to become, in 1868 and again in 1874, [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]].  He was elevated to the House of Lords in 1876. His willingness to take Christian oaths meant there were no barriers to his political career; for Jews who had not converted to Christianity the oath remained the key obstacle. The oath of office included the words “and I make this Declaration upon the true Faith of a Christian”.

For a time the advocates of Jewish emancipation seemed to have lost heart. The chief supporters of the bill, R. Grant in the Commons, and [[Henry Richard Vassall-Fox, 3rd Baron Holland|Lord Holland]] in the Lords, died within a few months of each other in 1840, and during the next four years the political activity of the English Jews was concentrated on the attempt to obtain admission to municipal office. A bill to that effect got as far as a first reading in the Lords by one vote, in 1841, but was lost on a second reading. It was not until 31 July 1845 that the bill was carried. On 18 August 1846, the [[Religious Opinions Relief Act]] removed some of minor disabilities that affected British Jews and dissenters from the [[Established Church]]; the only state office that still remained closed to Jews was Parliament.

The success with which British Jews had induced Parliament to admit them to the shrievalty and to municipal offices had been because Jews had been actual candidates, and had been elected to those offices before any parliamentary relief was asked. It was now decided to adopt the same policy in regard to a seat in Parliament itself.

A Jewish candidate, [[Lionel de Rothschild]], was elected as one of the four members of Parliament for the [[City of London (UK Parliament constituency)|City of London]] in 1847 but could not take his seat without taking an oath of office, and the bill that was introduced on 16 December that year was intended to carry out the wishes of a definite English constituency. This passed its third reading in the Commons on 4 May 1848, by a majority of 62 votes, but was rejected in the Lords by 163 non-contents to 128 contents. The same thing happened in 1849 when Lionel de Rothschild was again elected, but in the following year the struggle took on another and more dramatic form.

[[David Salomons]], who had successfully fought the battle for the shrievalty and the aldermanic chair, had been elected member for [[Greenwich (UK Parliament constituency)|Greenwich]] and insisted on taking his seat, refusing to withdraw on being ordered to do so by the speaker, and adding to his offence by voting in the division on the motion for adjournment which was made to still the uproar caused by his bold course of action. The [[Prime minister]], [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]], moved that Salomons be ordered to withdraw, and on that motion Salomons spoke in a dignified and forcible manner, and won the sympathy of the House, which nevertheless passed the Prime Minister's motion. The matter was then referred to the law courts, which decided that Salomons had no right to vote without having taken the oath of abjuration in the form appointed by Parliament, and fined him £500 for each vote he had recorded in the Commons. The government then brought in another bill in 1853, which was also rejected by the Lords. In 1855, Salomons was elected [[Lord Mayor of London]].

In the following two years, bills were introduced by the government to modify the parliamentary oath, but they failed to obtain the assent of the Lords. In 1858 when the Oath Bill reached the Lords they eliminated the clause relating to Jews; but when the bill was referred again to the Commons, the lower house refused to accept it as amended, and appointed a committee to formulate its reasons, upon which committee, as if to show the absurdity of the situation, the member for the City of London, Lionel de Rothschild, was appointed to serve, something which he could legally do, even though he had not taken his seat. A conference was appointed between the two houses, and ultimately a compromise was reached with the passage of the ''[[Jews Relief Act 1858]]'' by which either house might admit Jews by resolution, allowing them to omit the words "on the true faith of a Christian."

As a consequence, on Monday, 26 July 1858, Lionel de Rothschild took the oath with covered head, substituting "so help me, [[Jehovah]]" for the ordinary form of oath, and thereupon took his seat as the first Jewish member of Parliament; David Salomons was re-elected for Greenwich in a by-election and took his seat in early 1859.  Two years later a more general form of oath for all members of Parliament was introduced, which freed the Jews from all cause of exclusion.

==Reforms and political freedoms==
The [[Reform Act 1867]] granted every adult male householder the right to vote. Before this legislation only very few men in Britain could vote. In 1871, in the wake of the case of [[Numa Edward Hartog]], the [[Universities Tests Act]] removed the difficulties in the way of a Jew becoming a scholar or a fellow in an English university. In 1885, [[Nathan Rothschild, 1st Baron Rothschild|Sir Nathaniel de Rothschild]] was raised to the upper house as Lord Rothschild, the first Jewish Lord. In 1876 Disraeli was made [[Earl of Beaconsfield]]. They were followed within a few years by [[Henry de Worms, 1st Baron Pirbright|Henry de Worms]] as Lord Pirbright and [[Sydney Stern, 1st Baron Wandsworth|Sydney Stern]] as Lord Wandsworth. In 1890 all restrictions for every position in the [[British Empire]]  were removed being thrown open to every British subject without distinction of creed, except for that of monarch and the offices of [[Lord Chancellor|Lord High Chancellor]] and of [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]].

For some time after their admission to Parliament, the Jewish MPs belonged to the party that had given them that privilege, the Liberal Party, and Sir [[George Jessel (jurist)|George Jessel]] acted as solicitor-general in [[William Ewart Gladstone]]'s first ministry. But from the time of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] reaction in 1874 Jewish voters and candidates showed an increasing tendency toward the Conservatives. The influence of [[Benjamin Disraeli, 1st Earl of Beaconsfield|Benjamin Disraeli]] may have had some effect on this change, but it was in the main due to the altered politics of the middle and commercial classes, to which the Jews chiefly belonged. Baron Henry de Worms acted as under [[Secretary of State]] in one of [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]]'s ministries, while Sir [[Julian Goldsmid]], a [[Liberal Unionist Party|Liberal Unionist]] after the [[Home Rule]] policy of Gladstone was declared, made a marked impression as [[Speaker of the British House of Commons|Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons]].

Altogether the struggle had lasted for sixty years; nearly all that was contended for had been gained in half that period, but complete equality was not granted to Roman Catholics and Jews until 1890. The many political friendships made during the process had facilitated social intercourse{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}.

==Communal organisations and disunity==
The pause which occurred between 1840 and 1847 in the [[Jewish emancipation|emancipation]] struggle was due in large measure to a schism, which at the time seemed unfortunate, which had split the Jewish community in two and which prevented the members acting in unison for the defence of their rights. The Reform movement had reached England in a mild form under the influence of the [[Goldsmid family]], which had been touched by the [[Moses Mendelssohn|Mendelssohnian movement]]. In 1841 a [[Reform Jew|Reform]] congregation was established in London, and was practically excommunicated by both the [[Spanish haham]] and the German chief rabbi. The effect of these differences was to delay common action as regards emancipation and other affairs; and it was not until 1859 that the charity organisation was put on a firm footing by the creation of the [[Jewish Board of Guardians (United Kingdom)|Jewish Board of Guardians]]. Ten years later the congregations were brought under one rule by the formation of the [[United Synagogue]] (1870), in the charter of which an attempt was made to give the [[Chief Rabbi]] autocratic powers over the doctrines to be taught in the Jewish communities throughout the [[British empire]]. But Parliament, which had recently disestablished the [[Church of Ireland|Irish Church]], did not feel disposed to establish the Jewish Synagogue, and the clause was stricken out. The chief rabbi's salary is paid partly out of contributions from the provincial synagogues, and this gives him a certain amount of authority over all the Jews of the empire with the exception of the 3,000 or more Sephardim, who have a separate [[haham]], and of the dwindling band of Reformers, who number about 2,000, scattered in London, Manchester, and Bradford. In 1871 the [[Anglo-Jewish Association]] was established to take the place, so far as regards the British empire, of the [[Alliance Israélite Universelle|Alliance Israélite]], which had been weakened by the [[Franco-German war]]. The Jews of England felt that they should be organised to take their proper part in Jewish affairs in general. For many years they, together with the French Jews, were the only members of the religion who were unhampered by disabilities; and this enabled them to act more freely in cases where the whole body of Israel was concerned.

==Fighting false "blood libels"==
As early as 1840, when the [[blood libel against Jews|blood accusation]] was revived with regard to the [[Damascus affair]], and Jewish matters were for the first time treated on an international basis, the Jews of England took by far the most prominent position in the general protest of the European Jewries against the charge. Not only was the [[Board of Deputies]] at London the sole Jewish body in Europe to hold public meetings, but owing to their influence a meeting of protest was held by eminent Christians at the [[Mansion House, London]] (3 July 1840), which formed a precedent for subsequent distinguished gatherings. [[Sir Moses Montefiore]], after aiding the Damascus Jews by obtaining, in an interview with the [[Sultan]] at [[Constantinople]], a [[firman (decree)|firman]] repudiating the blood accusation, visited Russia in 1846 to intercede for his coreligionists there. In 1860 he went to Rome in connection with the [[Edgardo Mortara|Mortara]] affair; and in 1863 he led a mission to [[Morocco]] on behalf of Jews of that country. Action was likewise taken by the chief English Jews in behalf of the unfortunate [[Hebrews]] of the [[Danubian principalities]]. [[Francis Goldsmid]] made an interpellation in the House of Commons with regard to the Jews of [[Serbia]] (29 March 1867), and started a debate in that assembly (19 April 1872) on the subject of the persecutions of the Jews in [[Romania]]. As a consequence a Romanian committee was formed, which watched the activities of the illiberal government of that country.

==Pogroms in Russia==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Pogrom]] --&gt;
When in 1881 the [[Anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire|outburst of violence in Russia]] brought the position of the Russian Jews prominently before the world, it was their coreligionists in England who took the lead in organising measures for their relief. Articles in "[[The Times]]" of 11 and 13 January 1882, drew the attention of the whole world to the extent of the persecutions, and a meeting of the most prominent citizens of London was held at the Mansion House on 1 February 1882 (see Mansion House Meeting). As a consequence a fund was raised amounting to more than £108,000, and a complete scheme of distributing in the United States the Russian [[refugee]]s from Brody was organised by the committee of the [[Mansion House Fund]]. Similarly, when a revival of the persecutions took place in 1891, another meeting was held at the [[Guildhall, London|Guildhall]], and a further sum of over £100,000 was collected and devoted to facilitating the westward movement of the Russian exodus. An attempt was made this time to obtain access directly to the czar by the delivery of a petition from the lord mayor and citizens of London; but this was contemptuously rejected, and the [[Russian Jews|Russo-Jewish]] committee which carried out the work of the Mansion House Fund was obliged to confine its activity to measures outside Russia. When [[Maurice de Hirsch]] formed his elaborate scheme for the amelioration of the condition of the persecuted Jews, headquarters were established by him in London, though the administration was practically directed from Paris. The [[immigrant]]s being excluded from most of the cities of the Continent, the burden of receiving most of the Russian refugees moving westward fell on England, as well as America.&lt;ref&gt;http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=602&amp;letter=M#2023&lt;/ref&gt;

===Result of the Russian exodus===
"The advent of such a large number of Jews, unprovided with capital, and often without a definite occupation, brought with it difficulties. It was only natural that the newcomers should arouse a certain amount of prejudice by their foreign habits, by the economic pressure they brought to bear upon certain trades, especially on that of clothing, and by their overcrowding in certain localities. While [[the Continent]] had seen the rise of strong [[anti-Semitic]] feeling, England had been comparatively free from any exhibition of this kind. During Lord Beaconsfield's ministry, a few murmurs had been heard from the more advanced Liberals against the "Semitic" tendencies of the prime minister and his brethren in the race, but as a rule social had followed political emancipation almost automatically. The Russian influx threatened to disturb this natural process, and soon after 1891 protests began to be heard against the "alien immigrants. Bills were even introduced into Parliament to check their entry into England. Nothing came of these protests, however, till the year 1902, when the question had reached such a point that it was deemed desirable to appoint a royal commission to inquire into the whole subject. The commission heard evidence both from those favouring and from those opposed to restricted immigration. Reports were made to the House of Commons that the arrival, in the [[East End of London]], of Eastern European Jews, had brought [[smallpox]] and [[scarlet fever]]. The evidence, however, does not appear to have supported these accusations. "&lt;ref&gt;'Parliamentary Debates, 4th series, vol. 145, col.711.'' and ''L.Marks.

"'''Everything which is not forbidden is allowed'''" is a [[constitution]]al principle of [[English law]]&amp;mdash;an essential [[Political freedom|freedom]] of the ordinary [[Citizenship|citizen]] or [[British subject|subject]]. The converse principle&amp;mdash;"'''everything which is not allowed is forbidden'''"&amp;mdash;used to apply to public [[Authority|authorities]], whose actions were limited to the [[Political power|powers]] explicitly granted to them by [[law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RWEOX8EUuAEC&amp;pg=PA256|page=256|title=Judicial review in international perspective|author=Gordon Slynn Slynn of Hadley, Mads Tønnesson Andenæs, Duncan Fairgrieve|year=2000|publisher=Kluwer Law International|isbn=978-90-411-1378-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The restrictions on local authorities were lifted by the [[Localism Act 2011]] which granted a "general power of competence" to local authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=https://www.local.gov.uk/sites/default/files/documents/general-power-competence--0ac.pdf|title=The General Power of Competence|year=2013|publisher=Local Government Association, London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Totalitarian principle==
{{main article|Totalitarian principle}}
In ''[[The Once and Future King]]'', author [[T. H. White]] proposed the opposite as the rule of [[totalitarianism]]: "Everything which is not forbidden is compulsory."&lt;ref&gt;	T. H. White, ''[[The Sword in the Stone (novel)|The Sword in the Stone]]'' (book 1 of ''The Once and Future King''), Collins (1938)&lt;/ref&gt; This quote has been suggested as a [[Totalitarian principle|principle of physics]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Weinberg, "Einstein's Mistakes," in Donald Goldsmith and Marcia Bartusiak (eds.), ''E: His Life, His Thought and His Influence on Our Culture,'' Sterling Publishing (2006) p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt;

==National traditions==
The jocular saying is that, in England, "everything which is not forbidden is allowed", while, in Germany, the opposite applies, so "everything which is not allowed is forbidden". This may be extended to France&amp;mdash;"everything is allowed even if it is forbidden"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KAH40kRLfzsC&amp;pg=PA73|title=A Practical Guide to French Business|author1=Melanie Hawthorne |author2=Sylvie Saillet |year=2003|isbn=978-0-595-26462-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;mdash;and Russia where "everything is forbidden, even that which is expressly allowed".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u9mmg8i4DfMC&amp;pg=PA37|page=37|title=Managing safety|author=Kishor Bhagwati|year=2007|isbn=978-3-527-31583-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The saying about the Germans is at least partially true. In discussion amongst German scholars of German Law an argument often found is that a juristic construction is not applicable since the law doesn't state its existence – even if the law doesn't explicitly state that the construction does not exist. An example for this is the ''Nebenbesitz'' (indirect possession of a right by more than one person), which is denied by German courts with the argument that §868 of the [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch]], which defines indirect possession, doesn't say there could be two people possessing.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

'''Free Speech For People''' is a nonpartisan nonprofit organization founded in 2010 to advocate for a new constitutional amendment to limit campaign spending and to repeal the doctrine of [[corporate personhood]]. Free Speech For People has expanded its work since its founding and currently engages in efforts related to legal advocacy, corporate charter reform, and anti-corruption. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Free Speech For People Website|url=http://www.freespeechforpeople.org|website=Free Speech For People|accessdate=September 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2017, Free Speech For People joined nonprofit RootsAction to launch the Impeach Donald Trump Now campaign to target corruption at the highest level of government. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Impeach Donald Trump Now Website|url=http://www.impeachdonaldtrumpnow.org|website=Impeach Donald Trump Now|accessdate=September 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August, 2018 the organization released the book: "The Constitution Demands It: The Case For the Impeachment of Donald Trump," authored by Free Speech For People executive Director, [[John Bonifaz]], Legal Director, Ron Fein, and Board Chair, Ben Clements. The organization also launched the Impeachment Project at this time, a project designed to encompass all of Free Speech For People's anti-corruption related efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Impeachment Project Website|url=http://www.impeachmentproject.org|website=The Impeachment Project|accessdate=September 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Free Speech For People was founded by Massachusetts-based attorneys [[John Bonifaz]] and [[Jeff Clements|Jeffrey Clements]] in January, 2010 in response to the ''[[Citizens United v. FEC]]'' Supreme Court ruling.&lt;ref name="ACS Blog"&gt;{{cite web|title=Citizens United v.

FEC is a U.S. constitutional law case dealing with the regulation of campaign spending by corporations, and was extended to include labor unions and other associations.&lt;ref name="SCOTUS Blog"&gt;{{cite web|title=Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/citizens-united-v-federal-election-commission/|website=Supreme Court of the United States Blog|accessdate=August 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Free Speech For People supports a proposed 28th Constitutional amendment to overturn the Citizens United v. FEC ruling, that declares money does not equate to free speech, and corporations do not hold the rights of people.&lt;ref name="Daily KOS&amp;nbsp;- Massachusetts Legislators Back Free Speech for People"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Swanson|first1=David|title=Massachusetts Legislators Back Free Speech for People (Not Corporate Persons)|url=http://www.dailykos.com/story/2010/06/21/878063/-Massachusetts-Legislators-Back-Free-Speech-for-People-Not-Corporate-Persons#|website=Daily KOS|publisher=Daily KOS|accessdate=June 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Democracy Now"&gt;{{cite news|title="Free Speech for People" Coalition Calls for Constitutional Amendment to Overturn Citizens United Decision Allowing Unlimited Corporate Spending on Elections|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2010/10/28/free_speech_for_people_coalition_urges|accessdate=August 19, 2014|agency=Democracy Now|date=October 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Amendment Work==
Free Speech for People supports the Democracy For All Amendment and the People's Rights Amendment. The Democracy For All Amendment refers to a Senate amendment bill (S.J. Res. 8, 115th Congress)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=S. J. Res. 8 - 115th Congress|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-joint-resolution/8/text|website=United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary}}&lt;/ref&gt; introduced by Senator [[Tom Udall]] and an accompanying House amendment bill (H.J. Res. 31, 115th Congress).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=H.J. Res 31 - 115th Congress|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-joint-resolution/31?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22H.J.+Res.+31%22%5D%7D&amp;r=1|accessdate=September 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Democracy For All Amendment seeks to allow Congress to set limits on campaign spending, as existed prior to Citizens United v. Fec. 

Free Speech For People also supports the  People's Rights Amendment, which includes a Senate amendment bill (S.J. Res. 20, 15th Congress) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=S. J. RES. 20 - 115th Congress|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-joint-resolution/20?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22S.J.+Res.+20%22%5D%7D&amp;r=1|website=United States Congress|accessdate=September 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;[and an accompanying House amendment bill (H.J.

==Legal Advocacy==
Free Speech For People also engages in legal advocacy, public education and organizing to challenge the influence of money in politics, unchecked corporate power, and presidential corruption and abuse of power. 

===Legislation===
Recent legislative efforts include the drafting of a city ordinance, subsequently passed by the city of St. Petersburg, Florida, to abolish super PACs and ban foreign-influenced corporations from spending in local elections. The ordinance was the first of its kind, and was passed by the St. Petersburg city council after a 6-2 vote on October 5, 2017. The ordinance requires corporations that spend money in St. Petersburg elections to certify they are not foreign-influenced, or owned in whole or a significant part by foreign entities. The ordinance also establishes limits on contributions to political action committees, thereby abolishing super PACs in local elections. 

Other notable legislative efforts include the Massachusetts No Excuses for Corporate Discrimination Act (Bill H.767), drafted by Free Speech For People and intended to prevent business corporations from claiming religious exemptions from anti-discrimination law.

===Litigation===
Some of Free Speech For People's recent and notable litigation include the case Lieu v. Federal Election Commission. On November 4, 2016, Free Speech For People, on behalf of a bipartisan coalition of Members of Congress and 2016 congressional candidates, filed a lawsuit against the Federal Election Commission to abolish super PACs. The lawsuit, filed in federal district court in Washington, D.C., seeks the reversal of the 2010 federal appeals court ruling in SpeechNow.org v. FEC, which created super PACs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lieu v. FEC Complaint|url=https://freespeechforpeople.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/2016.11.04-As-Filed-Lieu-v.-FEC-Complaint-Time-stamped-.pdf|accessdate=September 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other key cases have targeted state campaign contribution limits, such as Lair v. Motl, in which Free Speech For People filed an amicus brief to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, arguing that Montana's campaign contribution limits should be upheld to protect the constitutional promise of political equality for all. Other cases have focused on individual worker's rights, including Elster v. City of Seattle, an amicus brief filed in partnership with Demos, to defend the city against a constitutional challenge to Seattle's "democracy voucher" program, a nationally-recognized public campaign financing system enacted by voter initiative in 2015 and first used in the city's 2017 election. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Litigation|url=https://freespeechforpeople.org/litigation/|accessdate=September 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corporate Charter Reform===
After a report from the [[Mine Safety and Health Administration]] found that "if basic safety measures were in place there would have been no loss of life at the 2010 [[Upper Big Branch Mine disaster]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=America's Most Dynamic (Yet Under-Covered) Movement: Overturning 'Citizens United'|url=http://www.thenation.com/blog/175129/americas-most-dynamic-yet-under-covered-movement-overturning-citizens-united#|accessdate=August 19, 2014|agency=The Nation|date=July 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which claimed the lives of 29 coal miners,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Years After Deadly Explosion, Coal Boss Talks Straight With Brian Ross|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds297w6F-ys|website=ABC News&amp;nbsp;- Nightline}}&lt;/ref&gt; Free Speech For People led efforts with the [[Rainforest Alliance]], [[Appalachian Voices]], and [[Robert F. Kennedy Jr]]. to revoke the corporate charter of the Appalachian coal mining company Massey Energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gerken|first1=James|title=Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. Targets Massey Coal Company|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/09/21/rfk-jr-masesy-coal-company_n_973628.html|accessdate=August 19, 2014|agency=Huffington Post|date=September 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenging President Trump==
===Impeachment Campaign===
In January 2017, Free Speech For People, joined by nonprofit RootsAction, launched the "Impeach Donald Trump Now" campaign. The campaign calls upon Congress to open impeachment investigations of Donald Trump. Their petition currently has over 1.4 million signers. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Impeach Donald Trump Now Website|url=https://impeachdonaldtrumpnow.org|website=Impeach Donald Trump Now|accessdate=September 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nine grounds proposed are: obstruction of justice; violations of the Foreign Emoluments Clause and Domestic Emoluments Clause of the United States Constitution; conspiring with others to: (a) commit crimes against the United States involving the solicitation and intended receipt by the Donald J. Trump campaign of things of value from a foreign government and other foreign nationals; and (b) conceal those violations; advocating illegal violence, giving aid and comfort to white supremacists and neo-Nazis, and undermining constitutional protections of equal protection under the law; abusing the pardon power; recklessly threatening nuclear war against foreign nations, undermining and subverting the essential diplomatic functions and authority of federal agencies, including the United States Department of State, and engaging in other conduct that grossly and wantonly endangers the peace and security of the United States, its people and people of other nations, by heightening the risk of hostilities involving weapons of mass destruction, with reckless disregard for the risk of death and grievous bodily harm; directing or endeavoring to direct law enforcement, including the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, to investigate and prosecute political adversaries and others, for improper purposes not justified by any lawful function of his office, thereby eroding the rule of law, undermining the independence of law enforcement from politics, and compromising the constitutional right to due process of law; undermining the freedom of the press; and cruelly and unconstitutionally imprisoning children and their families. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Case For Impeachment|url=https://impeachdonaldtrumpnow.org/case-for-impeachment/why-impeachment/|website=Impeach Donald Trump Now|accessdate=September 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Constitution Demands It: The Case for the Impeachment of Donald Trump===
On August 15, Free Speech For People released the book, "The Constitution Demands It: The Case for the Impeachment of Donald Trump." The book was written by Free Speech For People Legal Director Ron Fein, Co-Founder and President [[John Bonifaz]], and Chair of the Board of Directors Ben Clements, with a foreword by [[The Nation]]'s national affairs correspondent [[John Nichols (journalist)|John Nichols]]. "The Constitution Demands It" provides the case for impeachment of Donald Trump. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Constitution Demands It: The Case for the Impeachment of Donald Trump|url=https://www.impeachmentproject.org/book/|website=The Impeachment Project|accessdate=September 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===The Impeachment Project and other efforts to challenge President Trump===
On July 10, 2018, Free Speech For People launched a new campaign called the Impeachment Project, encompassing key initiatives launched to challenge corruption. The Impeachment Project includes efforts to: launch impeachment proceedings; to press for an investigation into whether to dissolve the Trump Organization Inc.; to demand that the Federal Election Commission investigate potential coordination between the Russian government and the Trump Campaign: and to advance the Divest Trump Soho Campaign to victory. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = The Impeachment Project Website|url=https://www.impeachmentproject.org|website=The Impeachment Project|accessdate=September 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2016, Free Speech For People, with [[Campaign for Accountability]], filed a complaint before the [[Federal Election Commission]] demanding an immediate investigation into whether the Russian Government illegally spent money to influence the 2016 presidential election, in possible coordination with the Trump campaign. In May 2017, they filed an updated complaint before the FEC based on new evidence. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FSFP &amp; The Campaign for Accountability File FEC Complaint Against Russian Government and Trump Campaignhttps|url=https://freespeechforpeople.org/fec-complaint-russian-govt-trump-campaign/|website=Free Speech For People|accessdate=September 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Impeachment Project also encompasses efforts related to Trump's business interests, including a call to the New York Attorney General to revoke the corporate charter of the Trump Organization, Inc. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dissolve Trump Inc.|url=https://www.impeachmentproject.org/dissolvetrumpinc/|website=Dissolve Trump Inc. |accessdate=September 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Free Speech For People also led a successful campaign in California and New York, in which it called on the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) and the New York State Comptroller to divest public pension funds from the Trump SoHo Hotel in New York City. After months of pressure, the private equity fund that owns Trump SoHo announced it will buy out the Trump Organization's contract to market and manage the troubled luxury condo/hotel, breaking a chain of illegal payments from state and local pension funds to the President. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Divest Trump SoHo Campaign|url=https://freespeechforpeople.org/divest-trump-soho-campaign/|website=Divest Trump SoHo Campaign|accessdate=September 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Basic forms of government}}
{{Politics sidebar|expanded=Subseries}}
A '''government''' is the system or group of people governing an organized community, often a [[State (polity)|state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=government|publisher=''Oxford English Dictionary'', Oxford University Press|date=November 2010|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/government}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of its broad associative definition, government normally consists of [[legislature]], [[Executive (government)|executive]], and [[judiciary]]. Government is a means by which organizational policies are enforced, as well as a mechanism for determining [[policy]]. Each government has a kind of [[constitution]], a statement of its governing principles and philosophy. Typically the philosophy chosen is some balance between the principle of individual [[freedom]] and the idea of absolute state authority ([[tyranny]]).

While all types of organizations have governance, the word ''government'' is often used more specifically to refer to the approximately 200 [[List of sovereign states|independent national governments]] on [[Earth]], as well as subsidiary organizations.&lt;ref name=EncycSocialSciences&gt;{{cite book|title=International Encyclopedia of the Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences|year=2001|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-08-043076-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically prevalent forms of government include monarchy, [[aristocracy]], [[timocracy]], [[oligarchy]], [[democracy]], [[theocracy]] and [[Tyrant|tyranny]]. The main aspect of any philosophy of government is how political power is obtained, with the two main forms being [[election|electoral contest]] and [[hereditary succession]].

==Definitions and etymology==

A government is the [[system]] to [[Governance|govern]] a [[state (polity)|state]] or community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=government|publisher=[[OxfordDictionaries.com]]|date=2010|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/government}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''government'' derives, ultimately, from the Greek verb κυβερνάω [''kubernáo''] (meaning ''to steer'' with [[Gubernaculum (classical)|gubernaculum]] (rudder), the metaphorical sense being attested in [[Plato]]'s [[Ship of State]]).&lt;ref name="britannica1911"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Encyclopædia Britannica: A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, Literature and General Information|year=1911|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Columbia Encyclopedia defines government as "a system of social control under which the right to make laws, and the right to enforce them, is vested in a particular group in society".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Columbia University Press | title=Columbia Encyclopedia, 6th edition |year=2000| title-link=Columbia Encyclopedia }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While all types of organizations have governance, the word ''government'' is often used more specifically to refer to the approximately 200 [[List of sovereign states|independent national governments]] on [[Earth]], as well as their subsidiary organizations.&lt;ref name=EncycSocialSciences&gt;{{cite book|title=International Encyclopedia of the Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences|year=2001|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-08-043076-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], the word ''government'' is also used more narrowly to refer to the [[ministry (collective executive)]], a collective group of people that exercises [[executive (government)|executive authority]] in a state{{cn|date=September 2017}} or, metonymically, to the governing [[cabinet (government)|cabinet]] as part of the executive.

Finally, ''government'' is also sometimes used in English as a [[synonym]] for [[governance]].

==History==
{{main|Political history of the world|Political philosophy}}

The moment and place that the phenomenon of human government developed is lost in time; however, history does record the formations of early governments. About 5,000 years ago, the first small city-states appeared.{{sfn|Christian|2004|p=245}} By the third to second millenniums BC, some of these had developed into larger governed areas: [[Sumer]], [[Ancient Egypt]], the [[Indus Valley Civilization]], and the [[List of Neolithic cultures of China|Yellow River Civilization]].{{sfn|Christian|2004|p=294}}

The development of [[agriculture]] and [[water control]] projects were a catalyst for the development of governments.&lt;ref name="brittanica2010"&gt;The New Encyclopædia Britannica (15th edition)&lt;/ref&gt; For many thousands of years when people were [[hunter-gatherer]]s and small scale farmers, humans lived in small, non-hierarchical and [[self-sufficient]] communities.{{cn|date=October 2017}} On occasion a chief of a tribe was elected by various rituals or tests of strength to govern his tribe, sometimes with a group of elder tribesmen as a council. The human ability to precisely communicate abstract, learned information allowed humans to become ever more effective at agriculture,{{sfn|Christian|2004|pp=146–147}} and that allowed for ever increasing population densities.{{sfn|Christian|2004|p=245}} David Christian explains how this resulted in states with laws and governments:&lt;ref name="Christian"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|As farming populations gathered in larger and denser communities, interactions between different groups increased and the social pressure rose until, in a striking parallel with star formation, new structures suddenly appeared, together with a new level of complexity. Like stars, cities and states reorganize and energize the smaller objects within their gravitational field.|David Christian, p. 245|&lt;u&gt;Maps of Time&lt;/u&gt;}}

Starting at the end of the [[17th century]], the prevalence of [[republic|republican forms]] of government grew. The [[Glorious Revolution]] in England, the [[American Revolution]], and the [[French Revolution]] contributed to the growth of representative forms of government. The [[Soviet Union]] was the first large country to have a [[Communist]] government.&lt;ref name=EncycSocialSciences /&gt; Since the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], [[liberal democracy]] has become an even more prevalent form of government.&lt;ref name="Kuper" /&gt;

In the nineteenth and twentieth century, there was a significant increase in the size and scale of government at the national level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|isbn=978-0-19-957967-9|title=The Oxford Handbook of State and Local Government|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This included the regulation of [[corporations]] and the development of the [[welfare state]].&lt;ref name="Kuper"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Social Science Encyclopedia|editor=Adam Kuper and Jessica Kuper|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-47635-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political science==
=== Classifying government ===
In political science, it has long been a goal to create a typology or taxonomy of [[polities]], as typologies of political systems are not obvious.&lt;ref&gt;Lewellen, Ted C. ''Political Anthropology: An Introduction Third Edition''. Praeger Publishers; 3rd edition (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; It is especially important in the [[political science]] fields of [[comparative politics]] and [[international relations]]. Like all categories discerned within forms of government, the boundaries of government classifications are either fluid or ill-defined.

Superficially, all governments have an official or ideal form. The United States is a [[Federal republic|constitutional republic]], while the former Soviet Union was a [[socialist republic]]. However self-identification is not objective, and as Kopstein and Lichbach argue, defining regimes can be tricky.&lt;ref&gt;''Comparative politics : interests, identities, and institutions in a changing global order'', Jeffrey Kopstein, Mark Lichbach (eds.), 2nd ed, Cambridge University Press, 2005, {{ISBN|0521708400}}, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[election]]s are a defining characteristic of an electoral democracy,{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} but in practice elections in the former Soviet Union were not "free and fair" and took place in a [[one-party state]]. [[Voltaire]] argued that "the [[Holy Roman Empire]] is neither Holy, nor Roman, nor an Empire".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Holy Roman Empire was neither holy, nor Roman, nor an empire | journal=Michigan Academician | last1=Renna | first1=Thomas | volume=42 | issue=1 | pages=60–75 | doi=10.7245/0026-2005-42.1.60 | date=Sep 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many governments that officially call themselves a "[[democratic republic]]" are not democratic, nor a republic; they are usually a dictatorship ''[[de facto]]''. Communist dictatorships have been especially prone to use this term. For example, the official name of North Vietnam was "The Democratic Republic of Vietnam". China uses a variant, "The People's Republic of China". Thus in many practical classifications it would not be considered democratic.

Identifying a form of government is also difficult because many [[political systems]] originate as socio-economic movements and are then carried into governments by [[political party|parties]] naming themselves after those movements; all with competing political-ideologies. Experience with those movements in power, and the strong ties they may have to particular forms of government, can cause them to be considered as forms of government in themselves.

Other complications include general non-consensus or deliberate "distortion or bias" of reasonable technical definitions to political ideologies and associated forms of governing, due to the nature of politics in the modern era. For example: The meaning of "[[conservatism]]" in the [[United States]] has little in common with the way the word's definition is used elsewhere. As Ribuffo notes, "what Americans now call conservatism much of the world calls [[liberalism]] or neoliberalism".&lt;ref&gt;Leo P. Ribuffo, "20 Suggestions for Studying the Right now that Studying the Right is Trendy," ''Historically Speaking'' Jan 2011 v.12#1 pp. 2–6, quote on p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1950s conservatism in the United States has been chiefly associated with the [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. However, during the era of [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] many [[Southern Democrats]] were conservatives, and they played a key role in the [[Conservative Coalition]] that controlled Congress from 1937 to 1963.&lt;ref&gt;Kari Frederickson, ''The Dixiecrat Revolt and the End of the Solid South, 1932–1968'', p. 12, "...conservative southern Democrats viewed warily the potential of New Deal programs to threaten the region's economic dependence on cheap labor while stirring the democratic ambitions of the disfranchised and undermining white supremacy.", The University of North Carolina Press, 2000, {{ISBN|978-0-8078-4910-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social-political ambiguity===
Every country in the world is ruled by a system of governance that combines at least three or more political or economic attributes.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} Additionally, opinions vary by individuals concerning the types and properties of governments that exist. "Shades of gray" are commonplace in any government and its corresponding classification. Even the most liberal democracies limit rival political activity to one extent or another while the most tyrannical dictatorships must organize a broad base of support thereby creating difficulties for "[[pigeonholing]]" governments into narrow categories. Examples include the claims of the [[Plutocracy#United States|United States as being a plutocracy]] rather than a democracy since some American voters believe elections are being manipulated by wealthy [[Super PACs]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.us.penguingroup.com/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9781594204098,00.html "Plutocrats – The Rise of the New Global Super-Rich and the Fall of Everyone Else"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407045309/http://www.us.penguingroup.com/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9781594204098,00.html |date=7 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The dialectical forms of government ===
{{Main article|Plato's five regimes}}
The [[Classical Greece|Classical Greek]] [[philosophy|philosopher]] [[Plato]] discusses five types of regimes: [[aristocracy]], [[timocracy]], [[oligarchy]], [[democracy]] and [[Tyrant|tyranny]]. Plato also assigns a man to each of these regimes to illustrate what they stand for. The tyrannical man would represent tyranny for example. These five regimes progressively degenerate starting with aristocracy at the top and tyranny at the bottom.

==Forms of government==
{{main list|List of forms of government}}

One method of classifying governments is through which people have the authority to rule.  This can either be one person (an autocracy, such as monarchy), a select group of people (an aristocracy), or the people as a whole (a democracy, such as a republic).

The division of governments as monarchy, aristocracy and democracy has been used since Aristotle's [[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}  In his book [[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]], [[Thomas Hobbes]] expands on this classification.

{{quote|The difference of Commonwealths consisteth in the difference of the sovereign, or the person representative of all and every one of the multitude. And because the sovereignty is either in one man, or in an assembly of more than one; and into that assembly either every man hath right to enter, or not every one, but certain men distinguished from the rest; it is manifest there can be but three kinds of Commonwealth. For the representative must needs be one man, or more; and if more, then it is the assembly of all, or but of a part. When the representative is one man, then is the Commonwealth a monarchy; when an assembly of all that will come together, then it is a democracy, or popular Commonwealth; when an assembly of a part only, then it is called an aristocracy. Other kind of Commonwealth there can be none: for either one, or more, or all, must have the sovereign power (which I have shown to be indivisible) entire.&lt;ref name="Leviathan"&gt;{{cite wikisource|author=Hobbes, Thomas|title=Leviathan|wslink=Leviathan/The Second Part}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Autocracy===
An autocracy is a system of government in which supreme [[Power (social and political)|power]] is concentrated in the hands of one person, whose decisions are subject to neither external legal restraints nor regularized mechanisms of popular control (except perhaps for the implicit threat of a [[coup d'état]] or mass [[insurrection]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.auburn.edu/~johnspm/gloss/autocracy |title=Autocracy: A Glossary of Political Economy Terms|author=Paul M. Johnson |publisher=Auburn.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[despotism]] is a government ruled by a single entity with absolute power, whose decisions are subject to neither external legal restraints nor regular mechanisms of popular control (except perhaps for implicit threat). That entity may be an individual, as in an [[autocracy]], or it may be a group, as in an [[oligarchy]]. The word despotism means to "rule in the fashion of despots".{{cn|date=November 2017}}

A [[monarchy]] is where a family or group of families (rarely another type of group), called the [[wikt:Special:Search/royalty|royalty]], represents national identity, with power traditionally assigned to one of its individuals, called the monarch, who mostly rule kingdoms. The actual role of the monarch and other members of royalty varies from purely symbolical ([[crowned republic]]) to partial and restricted ([[constitutional monarchy]]) to completely despotic ([[absolute monarchy]]). Traditionally and in most cases, the post of the monarch is [[inheritance|inherited]], but there are also [[elective monarchy|elective monarchies]] where the monarch is elected.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

===Aristocracy===
Aristocracy ([[Greek language|Greek]] ἀριστοκρατία ''aristokratía'', from  ἄριστος ''[[Wikt:aristocrat#English|aristos]]'' "excellent", and κράτος ''[[Wikt:kratos|kratos]]'' "[[Power (social and political)|power]]") is a form of government that places power in the hands of a small, privileged [[ruling class]].&lt;ref name=OED&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |authorlink= |date=December 1989 |title=Aristocracy |trans_title= |journal=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |volume= |issue= |pages= |id= |url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50011987?single=1&amp;query_type=word&amp;queryword=aristocracy&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10 |accessdate=December 22, 2009 |quote= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629022358/http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50011987?single=1&amp;query_type=word&amp;queryword=aristocracy&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10 |archivedate=June 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[Monarchy|monarchies]] were aristocracies, although in modern constitutional monarchies the monarch himself or herself has little real power. The term "Aristocracy" could also refer to the non-peasant, non-servant, and non-city classes in the [[Feudalism|Feudal system]].   

An oligarchy is ruled by a small group of segregated, powerful or influential people who usually share similar interests or family relations. These people may spread power and elect candidates equally or not equally. An oligarchy is different from a true democracy because very few people are given the chance to change things. An oligarchy does not have to be hereditary or monarchic. An oligarchy does not have one clear ruler but several rulers.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

Some historical examples of oligarchy are the former [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republic]]s. Some critics of [[representative democracy]] think of [[Oligarchy#United States|the United States as an oligarchy]]. The [[Athenian democracy]] used [[sortition]] to elect candidates, almost always male, Greek, educated citizens holding a minimum of land, wealth and status.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

A [[theocracy]] is rule by a religious elite; a system of governance composed of religious institutions in which the state and the church are traditionally or [[constitution]]ally the same entity.  [[Holy See|The Vatican]]'s (see [[Pope]]), [[Iran]]'s (see [[Supreme Leader of Iran|Supreme Leader]]), [[Central Tibetan Administration|Tibetan government]]'s (see [[Dalai Lama]]), [[Caliphate]]s and other [[Islamic state]]s are historically considered ''theocracies''.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

===Democracy===
In a general sense, in a [[democracy]], all the people of a [[state (polity)|state]] or [[polity]] are involved in making decisions about its affairs. Also refer to the rule by a government chosen by election where most of the populace are enfranchised. The key distinction between a democracy and other forms of constitutional government is usually taken to be that the right to vote is not limited by a person's wealth or race (the main qualification for enfranchisement is usually having reached a certain age). A democratic government is, therefore, one supported (at least at the time of the election) by a [[majority]] of the populace (provided the election was held fairly). A "majority" may be defined in different ways. There are many "power-sharing" (usually in countries where people mainly identify themselves by race or religion) or "electoral-college" or "constituency" systems where the government is not chosen by a simple one-vote-per-person headcount.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

In democracies, large proportions of the population may vote, either to make decisions or to choose representatives to make decisions. Commonly significant in democracies are political parties, which are groups of people with similar ideas about how a country or region should be governed. Different political parties have different ideas about how the government should handle different problems.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

[[Liberal democracy]] is a variant of democracy. It is a [[form of government]] in which [[representative democracy]] operates under the principles of [[liberalism]]. It is characterised by fair, free, and competitive [[election]]s between [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|multiple distinct]] [[Political party|political parties]], a [[separation of powers]] into different [[branches of government]], the [[rule of law]] in everyday life as part of an [[open society]], and the protection of [[human rights]] and [[civil liberties]] for all persons. To define the system in practice, liberal democracies often draw upon a [[constitution]], either formally written or [[Uncodified constitution|uncodified]], to delineate the powers of government and enshrine the [[social contract]]. After a period of sustained expansion throughout the 20th century, liberal democracy became the predominant political system in the world. A liberal democracy may take various constitutional forms: it may be a [[republic]], such as [[France]], [[Germany]], [[India]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Italy]], [[Republic of China|Taiwan]], or the [[United States]]; or a [[constitutional monarchy]], such as [[Japan]], [[Spain]], or the [[United Kingdom]]. It may have a [[presidential system]] ([[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Mexico]], or the [[United States]]), a [[semi-presidential system]] ([[France]], [[Portugal]], or [[Republic of China|Taiwan]]), or a [[parliamentary system]] ([[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Germany]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[India]], [[Italy]], New Zealand, or the [[United Kingdom]]).{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

=== Republics ===
A republic is a form of government in which the country is considered a "public matter" (Latin: ''res publica''), not the private concern or property of the rulers, and where offices of states are subsequently directly or indirectly elected or appointed rather than inherited.  The people, or some significant portion of them, have supreme control over the government and where offices of state are elected or chosen by elected people.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[[Montesquieu]], ''[[The Spirit of the Laws]]'' (1748), Bk. II, ch. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Republic|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; A common simplified definition of a republic is a government where the head of state is not a monarch.&lt;ref name="WordNet"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=republic |journal=WordNet 3.0 |accessdate=20 March 2009 |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/republic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="M-W"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Republic|encyclopedia=Merriam-Webster|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/republic|accessdate=14 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Montesquieu]] included both [[democracy|democracies]], where all the people have a share in rule, and [[aristocracy|aristocracies]] or [[oligarchy|oligarchies]], where only some of the people rule, as republican forms of government.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;Montesquieu, ''Spirit of the Laws'', Bk. II, ch. 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other terms used to describe different republics include [[Democratic republic]], [[Parliamentary republic]], [[Federal republic]], and [[Islamic Republic]].

== Scope of government ==
Rule by [[authoritarian]] governments is identified in societies where a specific set of people possess the authority of the state in a [[republic]] or union. It is a [[political system]] controlled by unelected rulers who usually permit some degree of [[individual freedom]]. Rule by a [[totalitarian]] government is characterised by a highly centralised and coercive authority that regulates nearly every aspect of public and private life.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

In contrast, a constitutional republic is rule by a government whose powers are limited by law or a formal constitution, and chosen by a vote amongst at least some sections of the populace (Ancient Sparta was in its own terms a republic, though most inhabitants were disenfranchised). Republics that exclude sections of the populace from participation will typically claim to represent all citizens (by defining people without the vote as "non-citizens"). Examples include the [[United States]], [[South Africa]], [[India]], etc. {{cn|date=November 2017}}

=== Federalism ===
{{Expand section|date=January 2013}}
Federalism is a political concept in which a ''group'' of members are bound together by covenant (Latin: ''foedus'', [[wikt:covenant|covenant]]) with a governing [[federal headship|representative head]]. The term "federalism" is also used to describe a system of government in which [[sovereignty]] is [[constitution]]ally divided between a central governing authority and constituent political units (such as states or provinces). Federalism is a system based upon democratic rules and institutions in which the power to govern is shared between national and provincial/state governments, creating what is often called a [[federation]]. Proponents are often called [[federalist]]s.

== Economic systems ==
{{further|Economic system}}
Historically, most political systems originated as [[socioeconomic]] [[economic ideology|ideologies]]. Experience with those movements in power and the strong ties they may have to particular forms of government can cause them to be considered as forms of government in themselves.

| [[Feudalism]] || A social-economic system of land ownership and duties. Under feudalism, all the land in a kingdom was the king's. However, the king would give some of the land to the lords or nobles who fought for him. These presents of land were called manors. Then the nobles gave some of their land to vassals. The vassals then had to do duties for the nobles. The lands of vassals were called fiefs.

{{voting}}

The term '''issue voting''' describes when [[Voting|voters]] cast their vote in [[election]]s based on [[political issue]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Denver, 19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson, 11&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of an election, issues include "any questions of [[public policy]] which have been or are a matter of controversy and are sources of disagreement between [[political party|political parties]].”&lt;ref&gt;Denver, 20&lt;/ref&gt; According to the theory of issue voting, voters compare  the [[Candidate#Candidates in elections|candidates']] respective [[Value (personal and cultural)|principles]] against their own in order to decide for whom to vote.&lt;ref&gt;Denver, 21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 98&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
A voter does not need to have an in-depth understanding of every issue and knowledge of how a [[candidate]] stands on every issue, but rather a sense of which candidate they agree with the most.&lt;ref&gt;Denver, 21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson, 132&lt;/ref&gt; Voters use many different tactics to rationalize their view on a particular issue. Some people look at what has happened in the past and predict how they think a particular issue will affect them in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Denver, 20&lt;/ref&gt;

Issue voting is often contrasted with party voting. A 2010 [[University of California, Davis]] study found that voters switch between issue voting and party voting depending on how much information is available to them about a given candidate.&lt;ref&gt;Highton, 455-458&lt;/ref&gt; [[Low information voter|Low-information elections]], such as those for [[Elections in the United States#Congressional elections|congressional candidates]], would thus be determined by [[Party politics|party voting]], whereas [[Elections in the United States#Presidential elections|presidential elections]], which tend to give voters much more information about each candidate, have the potential to be issue-driven.&lt;ref&gt;Enelow, 217-219&lt;/ref&gt;

Voters typically choose a political party to affiliate with in one of two ways.&lt;ref&gt;Denver, 20&lt;/ref&gt; The voter will create an opinion of an issue without consulting what a political party thinks about it, then choose the political party that best fits the opinion they already have, or the voter will study the opinions of the different parties and decide which party he or she agrees with the most.&lt;ref&gt;Denver, 21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 79, 98&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carmines, 78&lt;/ref&gt;

A voter's understanding of parties' principles is strengthened and developed over time as a person gains experience with more political events.&lt;ref&gt;Denver,21-23&lt;/ref&gt; In order for an issue to create the foundation for [[Political party|party]] choice, a voter must first be concerned about a particular issue and have some knowledge about that issue.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, 245&lt;/ref&gt;

In order for a person to be an issue voter, they must be able to recognize that there is more than one opinion about a particular issue, have formed a solid opinion about it and be able to relate that to a specific [[Political parties in the United States|political party]].&lt;ref&gt;Moore, 246&lt;/ref&gt; According to Campbell, only 40 to 60 percent of the informed population even perceives party differences, and can thus partake in party voting.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 104&lt;/ref&gt; This would suggest that it is common for individuals to develop opinions of issues without the aid of a political party.

==History of issue voting==
Prior to [[Paul Lazarsfeld|''The People's Choice'']] study in 1944, it was assumed by political scientists that voting was based solely on issues.&lt;ref&gt;Borre, 1, 2, 22&lt;/ref&gt; However, this study found little evidence of issue voting in the [[United States presidential election, 1940|United States presidential election of 1940]]. Rather, the researchers found that issues reinforced [[political party]] loyalties. Research stemming from the study concluded that voters' motivations could be broken down into three categories: [[party identification]], [[candidate]] orientation, and issue orientation. ''[[The American Voter]]'' in 1960 determined that party identification was the primary force, which in turn strongly influenced the other two categories. These three factors make up the Michigan School's approach to modeling voting behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Donsbach, "Issue Voting"&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the earliest research on issue voting done in 1960 found that voters often did not have enough information to link specific issues to individual candidates.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 109-102&lt;/ref&gt; Converse, in 1964, also concluded that voters did not have a sophisticated enough understanding of issues to be able to link them to candidates.&lt;ref&gt;Converse, 78-91&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, Key was one of the first people to conclude that voters are able to connect issues to certain candidates and cast their vote based on that information.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson, 11&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the growing knowledge of the field, reliable evidence didn't begin to appear until the 1970s. ''[[American Political Science Review]]'' published a symposium that hypothesized that there was a rise in issue voting in the 1960s. Nie and Anderson published an analysis of correlations with issue orientations in 1974 that attempted to revise the Michigan School's theory of the public's political belief systems' inherent limitations.&lt;ref&gt;Nie (1974) 541-591&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, Nie et all in ''The Changing American Voter'' attempted to explain the rise in issue voting through the fall in party voting.&lt;ref&gt;Nie 47-73&lt;/ref&gt; This decline of party voting, they claimed, came about because the proportion of the electorate with no party affiliation had fallen, and because the proportion of voters who cast votes for candidates from other parties had risen.

===Rise in issue voting===
In recent years, the United States has seen a rise in issue voting.  This can be attributed to the increased [[Political polarization|polarization]] in the last century between the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].&lt;ref&gt;McCarty et. al, 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nie, 172&lt;/ref&gt;  Both of these parties have become more extreme in their issue viewpoints. This has alienated [[moderate]]s from their parties.&lt;ref&gt;McCarty et. al, 2&lt;/ref&gt; Since a large portion of American voters are moderates, an increase has been seen in the number people who choose to affiliate as [[Independent (voter)|Independent]].&lt;ref&gt;McCarty et. al, 2&lt;/ref&gt; 
Identifying as an independent allows voters to avoid the constraints of a polarized political party. An independent voter can hand-pick a candidate based upon their positions on various issues rather than on their political party.&lt;ref&gt;Carmines and Stimson, 78-91&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Catholic Church|Catholics]] face the "issue voting vs. party voting" dilemma. Many Catholics support the [[opposition to legal abortion|pro-life]] stance which is backed by Republicans, but strongly oppose the [[capital punishment|death penalty]], which the Republican Party also supports. Extreme party polarization might cause Catholic voters to feel uncomfortable about both Republican and Democratic presidential candidates.&lt;ref&gt;McCarty et. al, 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nie, 172&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of [[trade union|labor unions]] strongly identify with the Democratic Party's advocacy for workers' rights, but unions also tend to not support [[gay rights]], a stance which more closely aligns with Republican views.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, 25&lt;/ref&gt;

==Complications regarding issue voting==
Many factors can complicate issue voting. First, issues are not always [[dichotomy|dichotomous]]; there are often many stances one could take.&lt;ref&gt;Nie, 158&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kessel, 460&lt;/ref&gt; Voters often must settle for the candidate whose stances are closest to their own.&lt;ref&gt;Nie, 158&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kessel, 461&lt;/ref&gt;  This can prove difficult when two or more candidates have similar opinions, or when candidates have positions that are equally far from a voter's. An example of an issue which might be difficult to issue vote on is [[Education in the United States|education]] spending. A voter may have a drastically different opinion from the available candidates on how much money should be spent on schools; this could lead the individual to vote based on party affiliation instead.&lt;ref&gt;Carmines and Stimson, 78-91&lt;/ref&gt;

A second complexity is that, oftentimes, problems do not line up on linear bases. That is, some issues may make it hard to even determine the candidate with the closest position.&lt;ref&gt;Nie, 158&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carmines and Stimson, 78-91&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980 US presidential election]] the growing threat of [[Communism]] in the [[Eastern Hemisphere]] was a salient issue for voters.&lt;ref&gt;Schweizer, 213&lt;/ref&gt;  There were many proposed solutions to this problem; [[Ronald Reagan]] endorsed military intimidation through increased spending and innovation (the [[Reagan Doctrine]]), [[Jimmy Carter]] proposed diplomatic efforts to keep peace, and the independent [[John B. Anderson|John Anderson]] advocated a return to the [[containment]] strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Schweizer, 213&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kirkendall&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bisnow, 24&lt;/ref&gt; None of these answers are [[mutually exclusive]], and they cannot be linearly plotted.  The voter would instead have to choose the candidate whose opinion represented the closest mix of possible solutions to their own.

A third problem that can complicate issue voting is if there are multiple issues that are equally salient to the voter.&lt;ref&gt;Nie, 158&lt;/ref&gt; A candidate may have a similar position to a given voter on one issue, but may take a considerably different stance on another.&lt;ref&gt;Nie, 158&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carmines and Stimson, 78-91&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this occurred in the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 US presidential election]]. During this election, two issues dominating attention were the economy and the wars in [[War in Afghanistan (1978–present)|Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq War|Iraq]]. Many viewed these issues as equally salient, and had a hard time picking one issue to vote on. These three complexities in issue voting have provided problems in using this tactic to choosing candidates.

A fourth problem is that voters may be unsophisticated and lack the knowledge necessary to vote based on issues. Political scientist [[Larry Bartels]] has argued that voters are generally uninformed and that their actual vote choices do not reflect the vote choices that a fully informed voter would make. He concludes that since voters lack full information, they cannot truly be issue voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/opinion/la-oe-bartels3-2008nov03-story.html|title=How smart is the American voter?|date=2008-11-03|work=|publisher=LA Times|via=|last1=Bartels|first1=Larry M.|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Models of issue voting==
While scholars employ many models to study voting habits, there are three primary models used in statistical studies of issue voting: the linear position model, the spatial model and the salience model. Each model takes a different approach to issue voting into account.

[[File:Linear Model of Issue Voting, April 2012.jpg|thumb|Linear Model of Issue Voting|right]]
*The Linear Position Model attempts to predict how strongly an individual will issue vote in an election. The model suggests that the more a voter and candidate agree on a particular issue, the better chance the candidate has of receiving the individual's vote.&lt;ref&gt;Borre, 19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meier and Campbell, 26-43&lt;/ref&gt; In this model, a graph is used to display the relationship between the number of people voting for the party and the consistency of the issue position.&lt;ref&gt;Borre, 19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meier and Campbell, 26-43&lt;/ref&gt; The equation “Y = a + bX” is used, where the variable “a” represents the minimal numbert of people voting for the party, “b” is a variable used to ensure that there is a positive gradient, "X" represents the consistency of the party's issue position, and Y represents the number of people who vote for the party.&lt;ref&gt;Borre, 20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davis et. al, 426-429&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Spatial Model attempts to show the perceptions and decisions of voters when issue voting strategies are used in elections.&lt;ref&gt;Cho, 275&lt;/ref&gt; This model assumes that if someone’s issue preferences are placed on a hypothetical spatial field along with all possible candidates’ policy positions, the individual will vote for the candidate whose political stances are closest to their own.&lt;ref&gt;Rabinowitz, 94&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCullough,199-22&lt;/ref&gt; Other models that follow the idea of “closeness” are called proximity models.&lt;ref&gt;Rabinowitz, 93, 96&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Salience Model asserts that the two major parties in the [[United States]] are associated with certain goals or views on an issue, and that the voter’s decision in selecting a candidate depends on the actual salience of the issue to the voter.&lt;ref&gt;Borre, 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 93&lt;/ref&gt; This model is important when considering issue voting because it utilizes election agenda data to predict election outcome.&lt;ref&gt;Borre, 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Niemi,1212&lt;/ref&gt; A simple view of this model can be summarized with the equation:

::Vote=a(Saliency of the party's issues)+b(Saliency of the party's issues)

::where "a"=Party 1, and "b"=Party 2

:The more important the issue becomes, the more a voter favors a particular candidate or party on the issue.&lt;ref&gt;Borre, 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davis et. al, 426&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Leader of the Opposition''' is a title traditionally held by the leader of the [[Opposition (parliamentary)|largest party not in government]] in a [[Westminster System]] of parliamentary government. The Leader of the Opposition is seen{{by who|date=July 2012}} as the alternative [[Prime Minister]], [[Premier]] or [[Chief Minister]] to the incumbent and heads a rival alternative government known as the [[Shadow Cabinet]] or Opposition [[Front Bench]].

In many [[Commonwealth realm]]s the full title is ''Leader of Her Majesty's Loyal opposition''.

'''Liberal conservatism''' is a [[list of political ideologies|political ideology]] combining [[conservatism|conservative]] policies with [[liberalism|liberal]] stances, especially on ethical and social issues, or a brand of political conservatism strongly influenced by liberalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parties-and-elections.eu/content.html|title=Parties and Elections in Europe|first=Wolfram|last=Nordsieck|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liberal conservatism incorporates the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] view of minimal government intervention in the economy, according to which individuals should be free to participate in the market and generate wealth without government interference.{{sfn|McAnulla|2006|p=71}} However, individuals cannot be thoroughly depended on to act responsibly in other spheres of life, therefore liberal conservatives believe that a strong state is necessary to ensure law and order and social institutions are needed to nurture a sense of duty and responsibility to the nation.{{sfn|McAnulla|2006|p=71}} It is a political position which also supports [[civil liberties]] along with some [[Social conservatism|social conservative]] positions and is usually regarded as a [[Centre-right politics|centre-right]] ideology. In [[western Europe]], especially [[northern Europe]], liberal conservatism is the dominant form of contemporary conservatism and has also adopted some [[social liberalism|socially liberal]] positions.

==Overview, definitions and usage==
As both "conservatism" and "liberalism" have had different meanings over time and across countries, the term "liberal conservatism" has been used in quite different ways. It usually contrasts with [[Aristocracy|aristocratic]] [[conservatism]], which rejects the principle of equality as something in discordance with human nature and emphasizes instead the idea of natural inequality. As conservatives in democratic countries have embraced typical liberal institutions such as the [[rule of law]], [[private property]], the [[market economy]] and [[constitution]]al [[Representative democracy|representative]] government, the liberal element of liberal conservatism became consensual among conservatives. In some countries (e.g. the United Kingdom and the United States), the term "liberal conservatism" came to be understood simply as "conservatism" in popular culture,{{sfn|Johnston|2007|p=155}} prompting some conservatives who embraced more strongly classical liberal values to call themselves "[[Libertarianism|libertarians]]" instead.&lt;ref&gt;Grigsby, Ellen: Analyzing Politics: An Introduction to Political Science. Cengage Learning, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, in the United States conservatives often combine the economic [[individualism]] of classical liberals with a [[Edmund Burke|Burkean]] form of conservatism that emphasizes the natural inequalities between men, the irrationality of human behavior as the basis for the human drive for order and stability and the rejection of natural rights as the basis for government.&lt;ref&gt;Grigsby, Ellen: Analyzing Politics: An Introduction to Political Science. Cengage Learning, 2011. p.106-112&lt;/ref&gt; However, from a different perspective, [[Conservatism in the United States|American conservatism]] (a "hybrid of conservatism and classical liberalism") has exalted three tenets of Burkean conservatism, namely the diffidence toward the power of the state, the preference of liberty over equality, and patriotism while rejecting the three remaining tenets, namely loyalty to traditional institutions and hierarchies, scepticism regarding progress and elitism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rDd5tKWT4D4C|title=The Right Nation: Why America is Different|first1=Adrian|last1=Wooldridge|first2=John|last2=Micklethwait|year=2011|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, in the United States the term "liberal conservatism" is not used and the American term "[[modern liberalism in the United States|liberalism]]", which occupies the centre-left of the political spectrum, happens to be quite different from the [[Liberalism in Europe|European brand]]. The opposite is true in [[Latin America]], where [[Economic liberalism|economically liberal]] conservatism is often labelled under the rubric of [[neoliberalism]] both in popular culture and academic discourse.&lt;ref&gt;Bethell, Leslie: The Cambridge History of Latin America: Latin America since 1930. Cambridge University Press, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

For their part, in their embracement of liberal and [[free market]] principles European liberal conservatives are clearly distinguishable from those conservatives who have embraced [[national conservatism|national conservative]] views, more [[social conservatism|socially conservative]] stances and/or outright [[populism]], let alone a [[right-wing populism|right-wing populist]] posture. In much of [[central Europe|central]] and [[northwestern Europe]], especially in [[Germanic-speaking Europe|Germanic]] and traditionally [[Protestantism|Protestant]] countries, a divide between conservatives (including [[Christian democracy|Christian democrats]]) and liberals persists. On the other hand, in those countries where liberal conservative movements have more recently entered the political mainstream, such as Italy and Spain, the terms "liberal" and "conservative" may be understood as synonymous. Often this involves stressing free market economics and the belief in individual responsibility together with the defense of [[civil and political rights|civil rights]] and support for a limited [[welfare state]]. Compared to traditional [[centre-right politics]], such as those proposed by Christian democrats, liberal conservatism is less [[traditionalist conservatism|traditionalist]] and more [[Right-libertarianism|right-libertarian]] economically, favouring low taxes and minimal state intervention in the economy. In the modern European discourse, "liberal conservatism" usually encompasses centre-right political outlooks that reject at least to some extent social conservatism. This position is also associated with support for moderate forms of [[social safety net]] and environmentalism. In this sense, "liberal conservatism" has been espoused for instance by [[nordic countries|Nordic]] conservative parties (the [[Moderate Party]] in [[Sweden]], the [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservative Party]] in [[Norway]] and the [[National Coalition Party]] in [[Finland]]), which have seen right-wing populist parties emerge to their right and do not comprise Christian democrats who form separate parties and the British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] under [[David Cameron]], who in an interview shortly after taking office as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] in 2010 said that he had always described himself as a "liberal conservative".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Cameron|first=David|title=I am a Liberal Conservative|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8685185.stm|publisher=BBC|accessdate=18 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his first speech to a Conservative Party's conference in 2006, Cameron had defined this as believing in individual freedom and [[human rights]], but being skeptical of "grand schemes to remake the world".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/5407714.stm "Full text of David Cameron's speech to the Conservative Party conference"], BBC, October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classical conservatism and economic liberalism==
[[File:EdmundBurke1771.jpg|thumb|150px|upright|left|[[Edmund Burke]]]]
Historically, in the 18th and 19th centuries "[[conservatism]]" comprised a set of principles based on concern for established [[tradition]], respect for [[authority]] and [[religious values]]. This form of [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditionalist]] or classical conservatism is often considered to be exemplified by the writings of [[Joseph de Maistre]] in the post-[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] age. Contemporaneous "[[liberalism]]" – now recalled as [[classical liberalism]] – advocated both [[political freedom]] for individuals and a [[free market]] in the economic sphere. Ideas of this sort were promulgated by [[John Locke]], [[Montesquieu]], [[Adam Smith]], [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[John Stuart Mill]], who are respectively remembered as the fathers of classical liberalism, the [[separation of church and state]], economic liberalism, [[utilitarianism]] and [[social liberalism]].

[[File:Alexis de tocqueville cropped.jpg|thumb|150px|upright|[[Alexis de Tocqueville]]]]
According to scholar Andrew Vincent, the maxim of liberal conservatism is "economics is prior to politics".&lt;ref name=vincent&gt;{{cite book | last = Vincent | first = Andrew | title = Modern Political Ideologies | publisher = Wiley-Blackwell | location = Chichester, U.K. Malden, MA | year = 2009 | isbn = 978-1-4051-5495-6 |chapter=Conservatism |pages=65–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others emphasize the openness of historical change and a suspicion of tyrannical majorities behind the hailing of individual liberties and traditional virtues, by authors such as [[Edmund Burke]] and [[Alexis de Tocqueville]],&lt;ref&gt;Lakoff, Sandoff, "Tocqueville, Burke, and the Origins of Liberal Conservatism." ''The review of politics'' '''60'''(3), pp. 435–464, 1998. {{doi|10.1017/S003467050002742X}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the basis of current liberal conservatism as seen both in the works of [[Raymond Aron]] and [[Michael Oakeshott]] and the ideological outlook of centre-right parties. However, there is general agreement that the original liberal conservatives were those who combined conservative social attitudes with an [[Economic liberalism|economically liberal]] outlook, adapting a previous aristocratic understanding of natural inequalities between men to the rule of [[meritocracy]] – without directly criticizing privileges of birth as long as individual liberties were guaranteed. Over time, the majority of conservatives in the [[Western world]] came to adopt free market economic ideas as the [[Industrial Revolution]] progressed and the aristocracy lost its power, to the extent that such ideas are now generally considered as part of conservatism. Nonetheless, in most countries the term "liberal" is used to describe those with free market economic views. This is the case, for example, in [[continental Europe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LmfAPmwE6YYC&amp;dq=EU+left-wing+liberal+parties&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Europe, a Political Profile: An American Companion to European Politics - Hans Slomp - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk|pages=106–108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goldfarb|first1=Michael |title='Liberal?

'''LiquidFeedback''' is free software for political opinion formation and decision making, combining aspects of  [[Representative democracy|representative]] and [[direct democracy]]. Its most important feature is the implementation of a [[Proxy voting|delegated voting]] system ("[[liquid democracy]]") which is to establish a new form of political representation and participation that takes into account the knowledge disparity of its participants.

== Description ==
LiquidFeedback helps groups (such as societies or organizations, political or not) make decisions, without the limitations of a traditional [[Internet forum]]. 
It aims to create an accurate representation of the opinions held by the members of the group without them being distorted by social hierarchies and knowledge disparities. Each individual is encouraged to further their own initiatives within the limitations set by the operators.

The proxy voting feature creates power structures similar to representative democracy, even though delegations can be withdrawn at any time. This is necessary to produce results that reflect the mood of the majority, even when they don't find the time to participate in person, in order to avoid the domination of the extroverts, which is the problem that regularly arises with grassroots democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://my.pages.de/activerts|title=The Dominance of the Activerts|author=Carlo von Lynx|publisher=Italian Pirate Party|year=2012|accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==
The proposition development process can be summarized as follows: 
* user driven, self organized process (collective moderation, no request commission necessary)
* every member can start an initiative
* quantified constructive feedback (support, suggestions, implementation assessment)
* initiators decide about implementation
* no fundamental opposition within an initiative
* every member can start an alternative initiative
* alternative initiatives define the issue and are voted upon together using [[Schulze method|Cloneproof Schwartz Sequential Dropping]] (Schulze Method)
To allow different values for timings and supporter quorums, and to allow the possibility of supermajority requirements for certain decisions, LiquidFeedback allows its users to have so-called "policies" for different kinds of decisions. The results can be used for information, suggestion, directive, or as binding decisions depending on the organizational needs and the national legislation.&lt;ref name="principles"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
LiquidFeedback was co-written by Andreas Nitsche, Jan Behrens, Axel Kistner and Bjoern Swierczek.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Etopia News L.A. talks with Andreas Nitsche|url=http://liquidfeedback.org/2012/06/27/etopia-news-la-talks-with-andreas-nitsche/#1|publisher=Interaktive Demokratie e. V. or Interactive Democracy|accessdate=25 December 2012|date=27 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The software incorporates the concepts of [[Delegative democracy|Liquid Democracy]], Proposition development process, Preferential voting or the [[Schulze method]], and Interactive Democracy into the operation of the software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Concepts|url=http://liquidfeedback.org/|work=Home page of LiquidFeedback|publisher=Interactive Democracy|accessdate=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The software was first published in October 2009 by Public Software Group e. V. after being suggested by some members of Germany's [[Pirate Party Germany|Pirate Party]] unsatisfied with conventional means of political opinion formation. Despite this affiliation, its developers are fully independent from the users of the software and they allow the software's usage by other parties and organizations. The first stable version of its back end was released in April 2010.

The software has been successfully used for the preparation of several national conventions by the Pirate Parties of Germany, Austria, Italy, Switzerland and Brazil. It is also used by [[Slow Food]] Germany and some local branches of the [[Five Star Movement]] in Italy.

==Protection of minorities==
LiquidFeedback provides several mechanisms to protect minorities. Even though decisions are finally made by majorities (see also: [[Majority rule]]), the software allows

* minorities and even individuals to present their point of views,
* minorities of a certain size to put their proposals to the vote.

In this context, all text contributions are sorted in a way that a proportional representation of the minorities is assured.&lt;ref name="principles"/&gt; Depending on the integration of the software, this may empower minorities to put their viewpoints to discussion directly at the top level of an organization without the necessity to go through a hierarchy.

==Technical specifications==
The front end is written in [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]] while the back end is written in [[PL/pgSQL]]. Both parts are released under the [[MIT License]]. There is also an [[API]] available which allows external applications to add additional features to the program.

== Criticism ==
The implementation of LiquidFeedback led to heated discussion among the members of the German Pirate Party: Defenders of data protection criticized the software's ability to match each statement and vote to its individual author, although that was the intention. Because the software only allows for voting by a [[recorded vote]], it is easily possible to identify the participants' political opinions by their voting behaviour. This improves the transparency of the political process as it makes any special interest openly visible.

Some&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://streetdogg.wordpress.com/2012/11/11/spqp/ |title=Senatus Populusque Piratus |author=Streetdogg, Pirate Party of Germany |date=2012-11-11 |access-date=2012-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; have argued that the ability to delegate votes could create and enforce power structures, even though delegations can be withdrawn at any time. The authors of the program later introduced an option for the organisation to activate automatic removal of inactive users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://liquidfeedback.org/2011/02/06/aussetzen-von-stimmgewicht-bei-inaktivitaet/ |title=Aussetzen von Stimmgewicht bei Inaktivität |date=2011-02-06 |author=jbebln |access-date=2011-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Meritocracy''' (''merit'', from [[Latin]] ''mereō'', and ''-cracy'', from [[Ancient Greek]] κράτος ''{{transl|el|kratos}}'' "strength, power") is a [[political philosophy]] which holds that certain things, such as [[Goods|economic goods]] or [[Power (social and political)|power]], should be [[vested]] in [[individual]]s on the basis of talent, effort, and achievement, rather than factors such as sexuality, race, gender, or wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of merit|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/meritocracy?s=t|publisher=[[Dictionary.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advancement in such a system is based on performance, as measured through examination or demonstrated achievement. Although the concept of meritocracy has existed for centuries, the term itself was first created in 1958 by the sociologist [[Michael Young, Baron Young of Dartington|Michael Young]].&lt;ref name="riseofmeri" /&gt; The Oxford English Dictionary shows the first use in 1956 and gives this citation. "1956 A. Fox in Socialist Comm. May 13/1 The ‘meritocracy’; the society in which the gifted, the smart, the energetic, the ambitious and the ruthless are carefully sifted out and helped towards their destined positions of dominance."  Young's entry is listed as "1958 M. Young Rise of Meritocracy iv. 71 Before the meritocracy was fully established, age-stratification as a substitute for the hereditary order may have been necessary for the sake of social stability."

==Definitions==
===Early definitions===
The "most common definition of meritocracy conceptualizes merit in terms of tested competency and ability, and most likely, as measured by [[IQ]] or standardized achievement tests."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levinson|first=David|last2=Cookson|first2=Peter W.|last3=Sadovnik|first3=Alan R.|title=Education and Sociology: An Encyclopedia|year=2002|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|page=436|quote=most common definition of meritocracy conceptualizes merit in terms tested competency and power, and most likely as measured by IQ or standardized achievement tests}}&lt;/ref&gt; In government and other administrative systems, "meritocracy" refers to a system under which advancement within the system turns on "merits", like performance, intelligence, [[credential]]s, and education. These are often determined through evaluations or examinations.&lt;ref name="riseofmeri" /&gt;

In a more general sense, meritocracy can refer to any form of evaluation based on achievement. Like "[[utilitarianism|utilitarian]]" and "[[pragmatism|pragmatic]]", the word "meritocratic" has also developed a broader connotation, and is sometimes used to refer to any government run by "a ruling or influential class of educated or able people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/meritocracy|title=Definition of Meritocracy|work=Oxford Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=12 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is in contrast to the original, condemnatory use of the term in 1958 by Michael Young in his work "''[[The Rise of the Meritocracy]]''", who was satirizing the ostensibly merit-based [[Tripartite System]] of education practiced in the United Kingdom at the time; he claimed that, in the Tripartite System, "merit is equated with intelligence-plus-effort, its possessors are identified at an early age and selected for appropriate intensive education, and there is an obsession with quantification, test-scoring, and qualifications."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought|year=1988|publisher=Fontana Press|page=521}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meritocracy in its wider sense, may be any general act of judgment upon the basis of various demonstrated merits; such acts frequently are described in [[sociology]] and [[psychology]]. Supporters of meritocracy do not necessarily agree on the nature of "merit"; however, they do tend to agree that "merit" itself should be a primary consideration during evaluation. Thus, the merits may extend beyond intelligence and education to any mental or physical [[wikt:talent#Noun|talent]] or to [[work ethic]]. As such meritocracy may be based on [[soft skills|character]] or [[intelligence|innate abilities]]. Meritocrats therefore reject evaluation on the basis of race, wealth, family circumstances, and similar criteria.

In [[rhetoric]], the demonstration of one's merit regarding mastery of a particular subject is an essential task most directly related to the [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] term ''[[Ethos]]''. The equivalent Aristotelian conception of meritocracy is based upon [[aristocracy|aristocratic]] or [[oligarchy|oligarchical]] structures, rather than in the context of the modern [[State (polity)|state]].&lt;ref&gt;Aristot. Pol. 2.1261b&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, (351 BC) ''Politics''. Book Three Part IV. (Jowett, B., Trans)&lt;/ref&gt;

===More recent definitions===

In the United States, the assassination of President [[James A. Garfield]] in 1881 prompted the replacement of the American [[Spoils System]] with a meritocracy. In 1883, The [[Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act]] was passed, stipulating government jobs should be awarded on the basis of merit through competitive exams, rather than ties to politicians or political affiliation.&lt;ref name="penl" /&gt;

The most common form of meritocratic screening found today is the college degree. Higher education is an imperfect meritocratic screening system for various reasons, such as lack of uniform standards worldwide,&lt;ref&gt;What's College For?: The Struggle To Define American Higher Education; Zachary Karabell; {{ISBN|978-0-465-09152-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Journal of College Teaching &amp; Learning – May 2008 Volume 5, Number 5 AACSB Accreditation&lt;/ref&gt; lack of scope (not all occupations and processes are included), and lack of access (some talented people never have an opportunity to participate because of the expense, most especially in [[developing country|developing countries]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Higher education and social justice |author1=Furlong, Andy|author2=Cartmel, Fred|isbn=978-0-335-22362-6|publisher=Open University Press|location =Maidenhead}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, academic degrees serve some amount of meritocratic screening purpose in the absence of a more refined methodology. Education alone, however, does not constitute a complete system, as meritocracy must automatically confer power and authority, which a degree does not accomplish independently.

==Etymology==
Although the concept has existed for centuries, the term "meritocracy" is relatively new. It was used pejoratively by [[United Kingdom|British]] politician and [[sociology|sociologist]] [[Michael Young (politician)|Michael Young]] in his 1958 [[satire|satirical]] [[essay]]&lt;ref name="riseofmeri"&gt;{{cite book|last=Young|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Young (politician)|title=The rise of the meritocracy, 1870-2033: An essay on education and inequality|year=1958|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|location=London| oclc=3943639}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Down with meritocracy: The man who coined the word four decades ago wishes Tony Blair would stop using it|last=Young|first=Michael|date=29 June 2001|work=[[The Guardian]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/jun/29/comment|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ford, Boris|year=1992|title=The Cambridge cultural history of Britain|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=34|isbn=978-0-521-42889-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kamolnick, Paul|year=2005|title=The just meritocracy: IQ, class mobility, and American social policy|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport CT|page=87|isbn=978-0-275-97922-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Best, Shaun|year=2005|title=Understanding Social Divisions|publisher=Sage|page=32|location=London|isbn=978-0-7619-4296-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Rise of the Meritocracy]]'', which pictured the United Kingdom under the rule of a government favouring intelligence and aptitude (merit) above all else, being the combination of the root of Latin origin "merit" (from "mereō" meaning "earn") and the Ancient Greek suffix "-cracy" (meaning "power", "rule").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=meritocracy|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|accessdate=3 July 2013|title="meritocracy" in the Online Etymology Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The ''purely'' Greek word is axiocracy (αξιοκρατία), from axios (αξιος, worthy) + "-cracy" (-κρατία, power).)
In this book the term had distinctly negative connotations as Young questioned both the legitimacy of the selection process used to become a member of this elite and the outcomes of being ruled by such a narrowly defined group.
The essay, written in the first person by a fictional historical narrator in 2034, interweaves history from the politics of pre- and post-war Britain with those of fictional future events in the short (1960 onward) and long term (2020 onward).&lt;ref name="young_p11"&gt;Young, Michael (1958). p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The essay was based upon the tendency of the then-current governments, in their striving toward intelligence, to ignore shortcomings and upon the failure of education systems to utilize correctly the gifted and talented members within their societies.&lt;ref name="young_p13"&gt;Young, Michael (1958). p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Young's fictional narrator explains that, on the one hand, the greatest contributor to society is not the "stolid mass" or majority, but the "creative minority" or members of the "restless elite".&lt;ref name="young_p15"&gt;Young, Michael (1958). p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, he claims that there are casualties of progress whose influence is underestimated and that, from such stolid adherence to natural science and intelligence, arises arrogance and complacency.&lt;ref name="young_p15" /&gt; This problem is encapsulated in the phrase "Every selection of one is a rejection of many".&lt;ref name="young_p15" /&gt;

It was also used by [[Hannah Arendt]] in her essay "Crisis in Education",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.instituteofideas.com/documents/PGF_Arendt_Education.pdf "Crisis in Education"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014030134/http://www.instituteofideas.com/documents/PGF_Arendt_Education.pdf |date=14 October 2013 }} (p. 4).&lt;/ref&gt; which was written in 1958 and refers to the use of meritocracy in the English educational system.  She too uses the term pejoratively.  It was not until 1972 that [[Daniel Bell]] used the term positively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Littler|first1=Jo|title=Meritocracy: the great delusion that ingrains inequality|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/mar/20/meritocracy-inequality-theresa-may-donald-trump|accessdate=14 July 2017|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Ancient times: China===
{{further information|Chinese Legalism}}
According to scholarly consensus, the earliest example of an administrative meritocracy, based on civil service examinations, dates back to Ancient China.&lt;ref name="APHq"&gt;Kazin, Edwards, and Rothman (2010), 142. ''One of the oldest examples of a merit-based civil service system existed in the imperial bureaucracy of China.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tan|first=Chung|first2=Yinzheng|last2=Geng|title=

This sets in motion the creation of the imperial examinations and bureaucracies open only to those who passed tests."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sienkewicz|first=Thomas J.|title=Encyclopedia of the Ancient World:|year=2003|publisher=Salem Press|page=434|quote=Confucius invented the notion that those who govern should so because of merit and not inherited status, setting in motion the creation of the imperial examinations and bureaucracies open only to those who passed tests}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Qin and Han dynasties developed a meritocratic system in order to maintain power over a large, sprawling empire, it became necessary for the government to maintain a complex network of officials.&lt;ref name="BC" /&gt; Prospective officials could come from a rural background and government positions were not restricted to the nobility. Rank was determined by merit, through the [[civil service examination]]s, and education became the key for social mobility.&lt;ref name="BC"&gt;Burbank and Cooper (2010), 51.&lt;/ref&gt; After the fall of the Han Dynasty, the [[nine-rank system]] was established during the [[Three Kingdoms]] period.

According to the [[Princeton University|Princeton Encyclopedia on American History]]:&lt;ref name="APH"&gt;Kazin, Edwards, and Rothman (2010), 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|One of the oldest examples of a merit-based civil service system existed in the imperial bureaucracy of China. Tracing back to 200 B.C., the Han Dynasty adopted Confucianism as the basis of its political philosophy and structure, which included the revolutionary idea of replacing nobility of blood with one of virtue and honesty, and thereby calling for administrative appointments to be based solely on merit. This system allowed anyone who passed an examination to become a government officer, a position that would bring wealth and honor to the whole family. In part due to Chinese influence, the first European civil service did not originate in Europe, but rather in India by the British-run East India Company... company managers hired and promoted employees based on competitive examinations in order to prevent corruption and favoritism.}}

Both [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] advocated meritocracy, Plato in his ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', arguing that the wisest should rule, and hence the rulers should be [[philosopher king]]s.&lt;ref&gt;See Estlund (2003) for a summary and discussion.&lt;/ref&gt;

===17th century: spread to Europe===
The concept of meritocracy spread from China to British India during the seventeenth century, and then into continental Europe and the United States.&lt;ref name="APH"/&gt; With the translation of Confucian texts during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], the concept of a meritocracy reached intellectuals in the West, who saw it as an alternative to the traditional ''[[ancient regime]]'' of Europe.&lt;ref name="EE"&gt;Schwarz (1996), 229&lt;/ref&gt; [[Voltaire]] and [[François Quesnay]] wrote favourably of the idea, with Voltaire claiming that the Chinese had "perfected moral science" and Quesnay advocating an economic and political system modeled after that of the Chinese.&lt;ref name="EE" /&gt;

The first European power to implement a successful meritocratic civil service was the [[British Empire]], in their administration of India: "company managers hired and promoted employees based on competitive examinations in order to prevent corruption and favoritism."&lt;ref name="APH"/&gt; British colonial administrators advocated the spread of the system to the rest of the commonwealth, the most "persistent" of which was Thomas Taylor Meadows, Britain's consul in [[Guangzhou]], [[China]]. Meadows successfully argued in his ''[[Desultory Notes on the Government and People of China]]'', published in 1847, that "the long duration of the Chinese empire is solely and altogether owing to the good government which consists in the advancement of men of talent and merit only," and that the British must reform their civil service by making the institution meritocratic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bodde,|first=Derke|title=China: A Teaching Workbook|url=http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/song/readings/inventions_ideas.htm|publisher=Columbia University}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice later was adopted in the late nineteenth century by the British mainland, inspired by the "Chinese mandarin system".&lt;ref name="MB"&gt;Huddleston, Mark W. Boyer, William W.''The higher civil service in the United States: quest for reform''. (University of Pittsburgh Press, 1996), 9-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The British [[philosopher]] and [[polymath]] [[John Stuart Mill]] advocated meritocracy in his book, ''[[Considerations on Representative Government]]''. His model was to give more votes to the more [[Education|educated]] voter. His views are explained in Estlund (2003:57–58):

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Mill's proposal of plural voting has two motives. One is to prevent one group or class of people from being able to control the political process even without having to give reasons in order to gain sufficient support. He calls this the problem of class legislation. Since the most numerous class is also at a lower level of education and social rank, this could be partly remedied by giving those at the higher ranks plural votes. A second, and equally prominent motive for plural voting is to avoid giving equal influence to each person without regard to their merit, intelligence, etc. He thinks that it is fundamentally important that political institutions embody, in their spirit, the recognition that some opinions are worth more than others. He does not say that this is a route to producing better political decisions, but it is hard to understand his argument, based on this second motive, in any other way.

So, if Aristotle is right that the deliberation is best if participants are numerous (and assuming for simplicity that the voters are the deliberators) then this is a reason for giving all or many citizens a vote, but this does not yet show that the wiser subset should not have, say, two or three; in that way something would be given both to the value of the diverse perspectives, and to the value of the greater wisdom of the few. This combination of the Platonic and Aristotelian points is part of what I think is so formidable about Mill's proposal of plural voting. It is also an advantage of his view that he proposes to privilege not the wise, but the educated. Even if we agreed that the wise should rule, there is a serious problem about how to identify them. This becomes especially important if a successful political justification must be generally acceptable to the ruled. In that case, privileging the wise would require not only their being so wise as to be better rulers, but also, and more demandingly, that their wisdom be something that can be agreed to by all reasonable citizens. I turn to this conception of justification below.

Mill's position has great plausibility: good education promotes the ability of citizens to rule more wisely. So, how can we deny that the educated subset would rule more wisely than others. But then why shouldn't they have more votes?&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Estlund goes on to criticize Mill's education-based meritocracy on various grounds.

===19th century===
In the United States, the federal bureaucracy used the [[Spoils System]] from 1828 until the assassination of United States President [[James A. Garfield]] by a disappointed office seeker in 1881 proved its dangers. Two years later in 1883, the system of appointments to the United States Federal Bureaucracy was revamped by the [[Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act]], partially based on the British meritocratic civil service that had been established years earlier. The act stipulated that government jobs should be awarded on the basis of merit, through competitive exams, rather than ties to politicians or political affiliation. It also made it illegal to fire or demote government employees for political reasons.&lt;ref name=penl&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/disp_textbook.cfm?smtID=2&amp;psid=3115 |title=Civil Service Reform |work=Digital History |publisher=[[University of Houston]] |accessdate=2016-02-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To enforce the merit system and the judicial system, the law also created the [[United States Civil Service Commission]].&lt;ref name="penl" /&gt; In the modern American meritocracy, the president may hand out only a certain number of jobs, which must be approved by the [[Senate of the United States|Senate]].

Australia began establishing public universities in the 1850s with the goal of promoting meritocracy by providing advanced training and credentials. The educational system was set up to service urban males of middle-class background, but of diverse social and religious origins. It was increasingly extended to all graduates of the public school system, those of rural and regional background, and then to women and finally to ethnic minorities.&lt;ref&gt;Julia Horne, and Geoffrey Sherington, "Extending the educational franchise: the social contract of Australia's public universities, 1850-1890,"  ''Paedagogica Historica'' (2010) 46#1 pp 207-227&lt;/ref&gt;  Both the middle classes and the working classes have promoted the ideal of meritocracy within a strong commitment to "mate-ship" and political equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Miriam Henry|title=Understanding Schooling: An Introductory Sociology of Australian Education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-_FSMpdmK3oC&amp;pg=PA81|year=1988|publisher=Psychology Press|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century to today===
[[Singapore]] describes meritocracy as one of its official guiding principles for domestic public policy formulation, placing emphasis on academic credentials as objective measures of merit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://app.mfa.gov.sg/data/paris/statements/REMARKS_FOR_MEDEF_28_Aug_08.html Speech by Singapore Ambassador to France], 28 August 2008. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302193448/http://app.mfa.gov.sg/data/paris/statements/REMARKS_FOR_MEDEF_28_Aug_08.html|date=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is criticism that, under this system, Singaporean society is being increasingly stratified and that an elite class is being created from a narrow segment of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.littlespeck.com/content/politics/CTrendsPolitics-061028.htm|title=Singapore's elites|author=Ngiam Tong Dow|date=28 October 2006|publisher=Little Speck|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061101220026/http://www.littlespeck.com/content/politics/CTrendsPolitics-061028.htm|archive-date=1 November 2006|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singapore has a growing level of tutoring for children,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wyomingfreelibrary.org/growing-trend-of-uplifting-education-business-in-singapore/|title=Growing trend of uplifting education business in Singapore|newspaper=Free Library and Tuition|access-date=2016-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and top tutors are often paid better than school teachers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.asiaone.com/news/education/1-billion-spent-tuition-one-year|title=$1 billion spent on tuition in one year|newspaper=AsiaOne|access-date=2016-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.epigami.sg/blog/2015-private-tuition-rates-singapore/|title=2015 Private Tuition Rates in Singapore {{!}} Epigami Blog|date=2015-01-21|newspaper=Epigami Blog|access-date=2016-10-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defendants{{Who|date=May 2018}} recall the ancient Chinese proverb "Wealth does not pass three generations" ({{zh|c=富不过三代}}), suggesting that the [[nepotism]] or [[cronyism]] of elitists eventually will be, and often are, replaced by those lower down the hierarchy.

Singaporean academics are continuously re-examining the application of meritocracy as an ideological tool and how it's stretched to encompass the ruling party's objectives. Professor Kenneth Paul Tan at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy asserts that  "Meritocracy, in trying to 'isolate' merit by treating people with fundamentally unequal backgrounds as superficially the same, can be a practice that ignores and even conceals the real advantages and disadvantages that are unevenly distributed to different segments of an inherently unequal society, a practice that in fact perpetuates this fundamental inequality. In this way, those who are picked by meritocracy as having merit may already have enjoyed unfair advantages from the very beginning, ignored according to the principle of nondiscrimination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tan|first1=Kenneth Paul|date=January 2008|title=Meritocracy and Elitism in a Global City: Ideological Shifts in Singapore|journal=International Political Science Review|volume=29|issue=7-27|doi=10.1177/0192512107083445}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meritocracy in the Singaporean context relates to the application of pragmatism as an ideological device which combines strict adherence to market principles ''without'' any aversion to social engineering and little propensity for classical social welfarism,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/in-theory/wp/2016/04/16/how-singapore-is-fixing-its-meritocracy/|title=Opinion {{!}} How Singapore is fixing its meritocracy|website=Washington Post|access-date=2017-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; is further illustrated by Kenneth Paul Tan in subsequent articles:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is a strong ideological quality in Singapore's pragmatism, and a strongly pragmatic quality in ideological negotiations within the dynamics of hegemony. In this complex relationship, the combination of ideological and pragmatic maneuvering over the decades has resulted in the historical dominance of government by the PAP in partnership with global capital whose interests have been advanced without much reservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tan|first1=Kenneth Paul|date=9 Dec 2011|title=The Ideology of Pragmatism: Neo-liberal Globalisation and Political Authoritarianism in Singapore|journal=Journal of Contemporary Asia|volume=42|issue=1|doi=10.1080/00472336.2012.634644}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Within the [[Ecuador]]ian Ministry of Labor, the Ecuadorian Meritocracy Institute&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130305014509/http://www.meritocracia.gob.ec/ Web page of "Instituto Nacional de Meritocracia de Ecuador"] , 12 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; was created under the technical advice of the [[Singapore]]an government.

Most contemporary political theorists, including [[John Rawls]], reject the ideal of meritocracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Theory of Justice|last=Rawls|first=John|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=91-92}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in recent years, Thomas Mulligan has defended meritocracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Justice and the Meritocratic State|last=Mulligan|first=Thomas|publisher=Routledge|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mulligan|first=Thomas|date=|title=Plural Voting for the Twenty First Century|url=https://academic.oup.com/pq/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/pq/pqx046/4157866|journal=The Philosophical Quarterly|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Routledge Handbook of Libertarianism|last=Mulligan|first=Thomas|publisher=Routledge|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=|chapter=What's Wrong with Libertarianism: A Meritocratic Diagnosis}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that a just society is one in which there is equal opportunity and people are judged on their merits.

==Modern meritocratic movements==

===The Meritocracy Party===
In 2007 an anonymous British group called The Meritocracy Party published its first manifesto, to which they have now added more than two million words on the subject (discussing [[Hegel]], [[Rousseau]], [[Charles Fourier]], [[Henri de Saint-Simon]], and various other philosophers, scientists, reformers, and revolutionaries). In summary, The Meritocracy Party wants to achieve the following:

# A world in which every child gets an equal chance to succeed in life.
# The abolishment of party politics.
# Only those with a relevant education and work experience should be allowed to vote, rather than just anyone who has reached the age of 18 or 21.
# The introduction of 100% inheritance tax, so that the super-rich can no longer pass on their wealth to a select few (their privileged children). This would mean the end of the elite dynasties and hereditary monarchy.
# A radically reformed educational system, based on the [[MBTI]] personality types, and insights from radical innovators such as [[Rudolf Steiner]] and [[Maria Montessori]].
# To replace [[free market capitalism]] with [[social capitalism]] and to replace democracy with a fully transparent meritocratic republic, under a meritocratic constitution.
# The end of [[nepotism]], [[cronyism]], discrimination, privilege and unequal chances.

On their website The Meritocracy Party lists five meritocratic principles&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.tn/books?id=ug4xDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT143&amp;lpg=PT143&amp;dq=meritocracy+party+uk+principles+and+goals&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bqxj2wdXhH&amp;sig=g7sp7-a428BizCKj3GroxrLX4LQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiJ0KaV4KTWAhVF3IMKHQ9lBhMQ6AEIOzAD#v=onepage&amp;q=meritocracy%20party%20uk%20principles%20and%20goals&amp;f=false|title=The Citizen Army|last=Spartacus|first=Brother|date=2016-04-30|publisher=Lulu Press, Inc|year=|isbn=9781326642167|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thirteen primary aims. The Meritocracy International is the host of all meritocratic political parties in the world and the place where these may be found by country of origin.&lt;ref name="keran"/&gt;

==Criticism==
{{see also|Just-world hypothesis}}
The term "meritocracy" was originally intended as a negative concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fox|first1=Margalit|title=Michael Young, 86, Scholar; Coined, Mocked 'Meritocracy'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/25/world/michael-young-86-scholar-coined-mocked-meritocracy.html|website=nytimes.com|publisher=NY Times|accessdate=18 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the primary concerns with meritocracy is the unclear definition of "merit".&lt;ref&gt;Arrow, Bowles and Durlauf. ''Meritocracy and Economic Inequality''. Princeton, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; What is considered as meritorious can differ with opinions as on which qualities are considered the most worthy, raising the question of which "merit" is the highest—or, in other words, which standard is the "best" standard. As the supposed effectiveness of a meritocracy is based on the supposed competence of its officials, this standard of merit cannot be arbitrary and has to also reflect the competencies required for their roles.

The reliability of the authority and system that assesses each individual's merit is another point of concern. As a meritocratic system relies on a standard of merit to measure and compare people against, the system by which this is done has to be reliable to ensure that their assessed merit accurately reflects their potential capabilities. [[Standardized test]]ing, which reflects the meritocratic sorting process, has come under criticism for being rigid and unable to accurately assess many valuable qualities and potentials of students. Education theorist [[Bill Ayers]], commenting on the limitations of standardized testing, writes that "Standardized tests can't measure initiative, creativity, imagination, conceptual thinking, curiosity, effort, irony, judgment, commitment, nuance, good will, ethical reflection, or a host of other valuable dispositions and attributes. What they can measure and count are isolated skills, specific facts and function, content knowledge, the least interesting and least significant aspects of learning."&lt;ref&gt;To teach: the journey of a teacher, by William Ayers, Teachers College Press, 1993, {{ISBN|0-8077-3985-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8077-3985-3}}, pg. 116&lt;/ref&gt; Merit determined through the opinionated evaluations of teachers, while being able to assess the valuable qualities that cannot be assessed by standardized testing, are unreliable as the opinions, insights, biases, and standards of the teachers vary greatly. If the system of evaluation is corrupt, non-transparent, opinionated or misguided, decisions regarding who has the highest merit can be highly fallible.

The level of education required in order to become competitive in a meritocracy may also be costly, effectively limiting candidacy for a position of power to those with the means necessary to become educated. An example of this was Chinese student self-declared messiah, [[Hong Xiuquan]], who despite ranking first in a preliminary, nationwide [[imperial examination]], was unable to afford further education. As such, although he did try to study in private, Hong was ultimately noncompetitive in later examinations and unable to become a bureaucrat. This economic aspect of meritocracies has been said to continue nowadays in countries without free educations, with the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], for example, consisting only of justices who attended [[Harvard]] or [[Yale]] and generally only considering clerkship candidates who attended a top-five university, while in the 1950s the two universities only accounted for around one fifth of the justices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Death by Degrees|url=https://nplusonemag.com/issue-14/the-intellectual-situation/death-by-degrees/|website=[[n+1]]|publisher=n+1 Foundation, Inc.|accessdate=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even if free education were provided, the resources that the parents of a student are able to provide outside of the curriculum, such as tutoring, exam preparation, and financial support for living costs during higher education will influence the education the student attains and the student's social position in a meritocratic society. This limits the fairness and justness of any meritocratic system.

Another concern regards the principle of incompetence, or the "[[Peter Principle]]". As people rise in a meritocratic society through the social hierarchy through their demonstrated merit, they eventually reach, and become stuck, at a level too difficult for them to perform effectively; they are promoted to incompetence. This reduces the effectiveness of a meritocratic system, the supposed main practical benefit of which is the competence of those who run the society.

In his book ''Meritocratic Education and Social Worthlessness'' (Palgrave, 2012), the philosopher [[Khen Lampert]] argued that educational meritocracy is nothing but a [[Postmodernism|post-modern]] version of social Darwinism. Its proponents argue that the theory justifies [[social inequality]] as being meritocratic. This [[social theory]] holds that [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s theory of [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]] is a model, not only for the development of biological traits in a population, but also as an application for human [[social institution]]s—the existing social institutions being implicitly declared as [[normative]]. Social Darwinism shares its roots with early [[progressivism]], and was most popular from the late nineteenth century to the end of [[World War II]]. Darwin only ventured to propound his theories in a biological sense, and it is other thinkers and theorists who have applied Darwin's model normatively to unequal endowments of human ambitions.

==Notes==
{{notelist|refs=
{{efn|name=fna|This is the history of the meritocracy in the technical sense. The vaguer definition of a meritocracy as a "rule by intelligence" has been applied to many ancient Greek, Indian, Chinese, and Jewish thinkers and statesmen. For example, the Sanhedrin, the legislature of [[Ancient Israel]] and [[Kingdom of Judah]], is sometimes called as an "intellectual meritocracy", in the sense that its members were drawn from religious scribes and not the aristocracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Elazar|first=Daniel Judah|title=The Jewish polity: Jewish political organization from Biblical times to the present|year=1985|publisher=Indiana University Press|page=127|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GntDdBeIOqwC&amp;lpg=PA127&amp;ots=6MByAfweKr&amp;dq=sanhedrin%20meritocracy&amp;pg=PA127#v=onepage&amp;q=sanhedrin%20meritocracy&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Appointment was self-perpetuating, however, and new members were chosen personally by existing members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Novak|first=David|title=The Jewish social contract: an essay in political theology|year=2005|publisher=Princeton University Press|page=134|quote=The Sanhedrin were appointed by those who were members when there was a vacancy}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are not meritocracies in the administrative sense, in which merit is determined objectively as a "tested competency or ability."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levinson|first=David|last2=Cookson|first2=Peter W.|last3=Sadovnik|first3=lan R. |title=Education and sociology: an encyclopedia|year=2002|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|page=436}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8120">The '''Monarchomachs''' ({{lang-fr|Monarchomaques}}) were originally [[Early Modern France|French]] [[Huguenot]] [[political theory|theorists]] who opposed [[monarchism|monarchy]] at the end of the 16th century, known in particular for having theoretically justified [[tyrannicide]]. The term was originally a pejorative word coined in 1600 by the Scottish royalist and Catholic [[William Barclay (jurist)|William Barclay]] (1548–1608) from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] μόναρχος (''monarchos'' {{spaced ndash}} "monarch, sole ruler") and μάχομαι ("makhomai" {{spaced ndash}} the verb meaning "to fight"), meaning "those who fight against monarchs".

Born out of the [[French Wars of Religion]], they were most active between 1573, a year after the [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]], and 1584. The Monarchomachs pleaded in favour of a form of "[[popular sovereignty]]". Arguing for a sort of contract between the sovereign and the people, they have been considered as the precursors of [[social contract]] theories.&lt;ref name=Gallica&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/themes/PolXVI6.htm Les Monarchomaques], ''[[Gallica]]'' {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory of tyrannicide ==

The Monarchomachs included jurists such as the Calvinists [[François Hotman]] (1524–1590), [[Théodore de Bèze]] (1519–1605), [[Simon Goulart]] (1543–1628), [[Nicolas Barnaud]] (1538–1604), [[Hubert Languet]] (1518–1581), [[Philippe de Mornay]] (1549–1623) and [[George Buchanan]] (1506–1582). Through the means of [[libel (poetry)|libels]] and theoretical tracts, they revived the doctrine of the [[tyrannicide]]. It had been opposed during the [[Middle Ages]] by the "legists" (jurists who theorized the royal power) who attempted to reserve the title of [[tyrant]] to those who tried to overturn the ruling monarch. Legists thus ended up legitimizing, under the name of "tyrannicide", the assassinations of political opponents ordered by the monarch.

Monarchomachs considered that the end of the [[Sovereign state|state]] was prosperity of the whole social group, as the true sovereign, granting effective practice of power to the king, whose authority remained of [[divine right of king|divine right]].&lt;ref name=Gallica/&gt; Exercise of popular sovereignty was to be delegated to the magistrates and the officers of the crown. They considered that the people were a collective body, possessed of a specific wisdom, which allowed them to understand better than the king the common good, distinct from the interest of each of its parties. Assimilated to the medieval ''[[wikt:universitas|universitas'',]] the people was thus considered as a legal subject, whose interests were represented by the [[French States-General|General Estates]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memo.fr/dossier.asp?ID=1011 Memo.fr] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070507125351/http://www.memo.fr/dossier.asp?ID=1011 |date=2007-05-07 }} {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://multitudes.samizdat.net/Un-pouvoir-constituant-pour-libres.html Un pouvoir constituant... pour libres professeurs ?] (on the book of Jean Fabien Spitz, ''[[John Locke]] et les fondements de la liberté moderne''), by François Matheron, ''[[Multitudes]]'', June 2002 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; This conception of the magistrates and the association of wise people as best representants of the people separated them from modern conception of [[democracy]], as they restricted effective power to a minority. [[Max Weber]] considered them in his lecture ''[[Politics as a Vocation]]'' as participants of the movement of [[rationalization (sociology)|rationalization]] of law in Europe. 

The Monarchomachs also claimed that if the sovereign persecuted true religion, he would violate the contract concluded between God and the people, who were thus granted a [[right of rebellion]]. They were inspired by [[Aristotle]], [[Thomas Aquinas]], and the [[School of Salamanca]] on the killing of "bad kings". This legimitization of tyrannicide may have inspired as much the [[Jacques Clément|friar Clément]], who assassinated [[Henry III of France|Henry III]] in 1589, as [[François Ravaillac|Ravaillac]], who assassinated [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] in 1610.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lefigaro.fr/litteraire/20061130.FIG000000196_jacques_clement_avant_ravaillac.html Jacques Clément avant Ravaillac], ''[[Le Figaro]]'', 30 November 2006 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rebellion against tyranny was considered not only as necessary, but as a divine right.

== Monarchomach theory in the 16th century ==

The term ''Monarchomachs'' was coined by [[William Barclay (jurist)|William Barclay]]&lt;ref name=Skinner&gt;[[Quentin Skinner]], ''The Foundations of Modern Political Thought'', Cambridge University Press, 1978, p. 301.&lt;/ref&gt; in his book ''De Regno et Regali Potestate'' (About the Powers of Authority and Royalty), published in 1600. Barclay's theory was that the Huguenots had lost their struggle with the Catholic Church and were turning their battle towards the government to undermine the king's support of the Catholics. Eventually, the term was used to classify anyone who was opposed to the king's rule. 

At first a Protestant doctrine, the notion of tyrannicide was reappropriated by the Catholics when Protestants came to be kings. It was then used in [[French Revolution|revolutionary]] discourses during the debates concerning the execution of [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]], while the right of rebellion was included in the 1789 [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]]. 

Influenced by the Huguenots, some British thinkers also embraced the Monarchomaque movement.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10998">The '''neighbourhood effect''' is an economic and social science concept that posits that neighbourhoods have either a direct or indirect effect on individual behaviors.  Although the effect of the neighbourhood was already known and studied at the beginning of the 20th century&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The City|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|year=1925|isbn=|location=Chicago|pages=|quote=|author1=Robert E. Park |author2=Ernest W. Burgess |author3=Rоderick D. McKenzie }}&lt;/ref&gt; and as early as the mid 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=London Labor and the London Poor: A Cyclopaedia of the Condition and Earnings of Those that Will Work, Those that Cannot Work, and Those that Will Not Work| author=Mayhew Henry|  year=1851| publisher=Harper}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has become a popular approach after the publication of the book ''The Truly Disadvantaged'' by William Julius Wilson in 1987. Wilson's theory suggests that living in a neighbourhood seriously affected by poverty affects a  wide  range  of  individual outcomes, such as economic self-sufficiency, violence, drug use, low birthweight, and cognitive ability.

In more recent years neighbourhood  effects have been also studied in epidemiology and psychology. For example, Murray and colleagues have shown that older workers living in areas with higher unemployment are less likely to be in work ten years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Murray|first=Emily T.|last2=Head|first2=Jenny|last3=Shelton|first3=Nicola|last4=Hagger-Johnson|first4=Gareth|last5=Stansfeld|first5=Stephen|last6=Zaninotto|first6=Paola|last7=Stafford|first7=Mai|date=2016-02-27|title=Local area unemployment, individual health and workforce exit: ONS Longitudinal Study|url=https://academic.oup.com/eurpub/article/26/3/463/2467312|journal=The European Journal of Public Health|language=en|volume=26|issue=3|pages=463–469|doi=10.1093/eurpub/ckw005|issn=1101-1262}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some research has shown that the living conditions of the neighbourhood  interact with individual's negative life events. The same event is more likely to trigger depression in disadvantaged neighbourhoods than in neighbourhoods with a good quality of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Elliott|first=M|date=2000-12-01|title=The stress process in neighborhood context|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1353829200000101|journal=Health &amp; Place|volume=6|issue=4|pages=287–299|doi=10.1016/S1353-8292(00)00010-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This hypothesis is supported by Catherine Ross&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ross|first=Catherine E.|date=2000|year=|title=Neighborhood Disadvantage and Adult Depression|jstor=2676304|journal=Journal of Health and Social Behavior|volume=41|issue=2|pages=177–187|doi=10.2307/2676304}}&lt;/ref&gt; who shows that socially disordered neighborhoods are associated with depressive symptoms.

== The Neighbourhood Effect on Voting Behavior ==
In political science the neighbourhood effect defines the tendency of a person to vote in a certain direction based upon the relational effects of the people living in the neighbourhood. The voting preference of a neighbourhood tends to be formed by consensus, where people tend to vote with the general trend of the neighbourhood. This consensus is formed by the personal connections a person forms in a community. There also seems to be some [[Socioeconomics|socio-economic]] correlation to voting patterns, and this has also been used to predict voting behavior.

=== History ===
The term was coined in the seminal works of Kevin Cox in 'The Voting Decision in a Spatial Context'&lt;ref&gt;K.R. Cox, ''Progress in Geography'', "The Voting Decision in a Spatial Context" (1969)&lt;/ref&gt; and later popularized by [[Ron J. Johnston]] in 'Political Geography' (1979) and  Peter J. Taylor and G. Gudgin in 'Geography of Elections' (1979)&lt;ref&gt;N. Wrigley and R.J. Bennett (eds.), ''Quantitative Geography: A British View'' (1981).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R.J. Johnston, ''Political Geography'' (1979), Chapter 34, and P.J. Taylor and G. Gudgin, ''Geography of Elections'' (1979), Chapter 35.&lt;/ref&gt; It seems, at the time at least, that they were attempting to justify the use of mathematical modelling in the study of voting patterns and the correlations between spatial data. Both seem to have made a case that studying this is only possible with good [[Numerical data|quantitative data]] and an understanding of how people in these small spatial areas live, work, and think.

=== Miller's Models ===
W.L. Miller, however, began work on quantifying the neighbourhood effect in 1977. In his work 'Electoral Dynamics' (1977) he formed the hypothesis that "people who talk together vote together" and began trying to quantify this controversial idea.&lt;ref&gt;W.L. Miller, ''Electoral Dynamics'' (1977).&lt;/ref&gt; He found that majority positions are more dominant than the socio-economic statistics of individuals in the area would suggest. He suggested four models by which voting patterns may be explained:

1) The "no environmental effect" model, which postulates no differences in voting behaviour by neighbourhood type – contacts with neighbours have no influence on how people vote.

2) The "environmental effect model", which suggests that 'people may be irritated, alarmed and antagonized by contact with those unlike themselves' and become even stronger supporters of their 'class party' than might otherwise be the case – [[Middle class|middle-class]] people are more pro-Conservative in [[Working class|working-class]] than middle-class areas, for example, and working-class people are less pro-Conservative in strongly middle-class areas.

3) The "consensual environmental effect" model, which argues that 'people will be influenced towards agreement with their contacts', so that, for example, 'both middle- and working-class individuals are more Conservative in middle-class areas because both sets of individuals have fewer working-class contacts and more middle-class contacts than if they lived elsewhere' – which is what most writers associate with the neighbourhood effect.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, ''Political Geography''.&lt;/ref&gt;

4) The "Przeworski environmental effect" model, which suggests that the two classes operate in different ways – the middle class operate according to the reactive model in working-class areas, whereas the working class operate according to the consensual model in middle-class areas.&lt;ref&gt;A. Przeworski and G.A.D Soares, ''American [[Political science|Political Science]] Review'', "Theories in Search of a Curve: A Contextual Interpretation of the Left Vote" (1971).&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnston makes easier to understand social parallels that can be better understood by the layman. He explains these models as (1) I talk with them and vote as they do; (2) I want to be like them so I live with them; (3) I live among them and want to be like them; (4) what I observe around me makes me vote with them; and (5) they want me to vote for them here.&lt;ref&gt;Ron Johnston et al, ''Environment and Planning'', "Neighborhood [[social capital]] and neighborhood effects" (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cox ===
Cox, in a similar attempt to understand the neighbourhood effect, attempted to define how people interact.&lt;ref&gt;Cox. "The Voting Decision in a Spatial Context".&lt;/ref&gt; He found that there was an [[inverse relationship]] between the distance and the formation of a relationship. This seems pretty straightforward and is easily applied to one's life. He also found that the relationships that people form typically have some sort of politically partisan undertones that people take in. He also found that these relationships have more of an effect on a person's political leanings than the person's prior predispositions. This is counter-intuitive because many have argued that a person will inherit their political leanings from their family.&lt;ref&gt;C. Pattie and R. Johnston, ''Annals of the Association of American Geographers'', "People Who Talk Together Vote Together: 
An Exploration of Contextual Effects in [[Great Britain]]" (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

Curtice argued against the [[social interaction]] model in 'Is Talking over the Garden Fence of Political Import?'&lt;ref&gt;J. Curtice, ''Is Talking over the Garden Fence of Political Import? (1995).&lt;/ref&gt; Curtice argued, from his data set, that the influence on voting patterns by social interactions is of such small consequence as to be nearly negligible in explaining the neighbourhood effect.

=== Huckfeldt and Sprague Experiment ===
The first group that attempted to find an empirical link between social interaction and voting patterns was R. Huckfeldt and J. Sprague.&lt;ref&gt;R. Huckfeldt, J. Sprague, and J. Levine, ''American Political Science Review'', "Dynamics of Collective Deliberation in the 1996 Election: Campaign Effects on Accessibility, Certainty, and Accuracy" (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; They did a survey of people in Indianapolis and St. Louis to find who people are and whom they talk to about politics. The group also interviewed the people that the respondents identified as those they would be most likely to talk to about politics. They definitively found that people do vote in similar ways to those that they interacted with. This data finally gave some backing to Miller's idea that "people who talk together vote together." All of these experiments seem to lend some credence to the models that Cox theorized and Miller formed.

===Johnson, Phillips Shively and Stein ===
The neighborhood effect has broadened the study of the voter from the individual level of analysis to account for the effect of where one lives on their voting decisions.  This contribution to contextual analysis has broadened the study of voter behavior.

'''Neo-Nazism''' consists of post-[[World War II]] militant social or political movements seeking to revive and implement the ideology of [[Nazism]]. Neo-Nazis seek to employ their ideology to promote hatred and attack minorities, or in some cases to create a fascist political state.&lt;ref&gt;Gay, Kathlyn (1997) [https://books.google.com/books?id=NWYLkF5NHVsC&amp;q=%22Neo-nazis%22+goals&amp;dq=%22Neo-nazis%22+goals&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi3pYzk05raAhXjT98KHehxDawQ6AEINTAC ''Neo-Nazis: A Growing Threat''].

Quote: "While some neo-Nazi groups emphasize simple hatred, others are more focused on the revolutionary '''''creation of a fascist political state'''''." (emphasis added)&lt;/ref&gt; It is a global phenomenon, with organized representation in many countries and international networks. It borrows elements from Nazi doctrine, including [[ultranationalism]], [[racism]], [[xenophobia]], [[ableism]], [[homophobia]], [[anti-Romanyism]], [[antisemitism]], [[anti-communism]] and initiating the [[Fourth Reich]]. [[Holocaust denial]] is a common feature, as is the incorporation of [[Nazi symbolism|Nazi symbols]] and admiration of [[Adolf Hitler]].

In some [[Europe]]an and [[Latin America]]n countries, laws prohibit the expression of pro-Nazi, racist, anti-Semitic, or homophobic views. Many Nazi-related symbols are banned in European countries (especially [[Strafgesetzbuch_section_86a|Germany]]) in an effort to curtail neo-Nazism.&lt;ref&gt;

===Hyperborean racial doctrine===
{{see also|Esoteric Nazism}}
Neo-Nazi writers have posited a spiritual, esoteric doctrine of [[Race (human categorization)|race]], which moves beyond the primarily [[Darwinian]]-inspired materialist [[scientific racism]] popular mainly in the [[Anglosphere]] during the 20th century. Figures influential in the development of neo-Nazi racism,{{cn|reason=Citation needed for 'influential in the development of neo-Nazi racism', as our only current cited source (Southern Poverty Law Center, 2015) presents them as influential on the 'bizarre fringes' of Nazism, but racism is central to Nazism, not just part of its fringe|date=October 2018}} such as [[Miguel Serrano]] and [[Julius Evola]] (writers who are described by critics of Nazism such as the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] as influential within what it presents as parts of "the bizarre fringes of National Socialism, past and present"),&lt;ref name=2015-02-08&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2002/new-book-black-sun-looks-fringes-national-socialism|publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center|title=New Book, Black Sun, Looks at Fringes of National Socialism|date=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; claim that the [[Hyperborean]] ancestors of the [[Aryans]] were in the distant past, far higher beings than their current state, having suffered from "involution" due to mixing with the "Telluric" peoples; supposed creations of the [[Demiurge]]. Within this theory, if the "Aryans" are to return to the [[Golden Age]] of the distant past, they need to awaken the memory of the blood. An [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] origin of the Hyperboreans is often claimed. These theories draw influence from [[Gnosticism]] and [[Tantrism]], building on the work of the [[Ahnenerbe]]. Within this racist theory, Jews are held up as the antithesis of nobility, purity and beauty.

===Ecology and environmentalism===
Neo-Nazism generally aligns itself with a [[blood and soil]] variation of [[environmentalism]], which has themes in common with [[deep ecology]], the [[organic movement]] and [[animal protectionism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dw.com/en/neo-nazis-cloak-themselves-in-eco-rhetoric/a-15793310|publisher=DW|title=Neo-Nazis cloak themselves in eco-rhetoric|date=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.redpepper.org.uk/darker-shades-of-green/|publisher=Red Pepper|title=Darker Shades of Green|date=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tendency, sometimes called "[[ecofascism]]", was represented in the original German National Socialism by [[Richard Walther Darré]] who was the [[Reichsminister of Food]] from 1933 until 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spunk.org/texts/places/germany/sp001630/peter.html|publisher=Peter Staudenmaier|title=Fascist Ecology: The "Green Wing" of the Nazi Party and its Historical Antecedents|date=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
=== Germany and Austria 1945–1950s===
Following the defeat of [[Nazi Germany]], the political ideology of the ruling party, Nazism, was in complete disarray. The final leader of the [[Nazi Party|National Socialist German Workers' Party]] was [[Martin Bormann]]. He died on 2 May 1945 during the [[Battle of Berlin]], but the [[Soviet Union]] did not reveal his death to the rest of the world, and his ultimate fate remained a mystery for many years. [[Conspiracy theories about Adolf Hitler's death|Conspiracy theories]] emerged about Hitler himself, that he had secretly survived the war and fled to South America or elsewhere.

The [[Allied Control Council]] officially dissolved the NSDAP on 10 October 1945, marking the end of "Old" National Socialism. A process of [[denazification]] began, and the [[Nuremberg trials]] took place, where many major leaders and ideologues were condemned to death by October 1946, others committed suicide.

[[File:Otto Ernst Remer portrait.JPG|thumb|right|175px|It[[Otto Ernst Remer]], leader of the postwar [[Socialist Reich Party]]]]

In both the East and West, surviving ex-party members and military veterans assimilated to the new reality and had no interest in constructing a "neo-Nazism."{{cn|date=December 2017}} However, during the [[West German federal election, 1949|1949 elections]] a number of National Socialist advocates such as [[Fritz Rössler]] had infiltrated the national conservative ''[[Deutsche Rechtspartei]]'', which had 5 members elected. Rössler and others left to found the more radical [[Socialist Reich Party]] under [[Otto Ernst Remer]]. At the onset of the [[Cold War]], the SRP favoured the Soviet Union over the United States.&lt;ref name="remer"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ihr.org/jhr/v10/v10p108_Schoeman.html|publisher=[[Institute for Historical Review]]|title=An Interview With General Otto Ernst Remer|date=8 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[Austria]] national independence had been restored, and the ''[[Verbotsgesetz 1947]]'' explicitly criminalised the NSDAP and any attempt at restoration. 
West Germany adopted a similar law to target parties it defined as anti-constitutional; Article 21 Paragraph 2 in the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Basic Law]], banning the Socialist Reich Party in 1952 for being opposed to [[liberal democracy]].

As a consequence some members of the nascent movement of German neo-Nazism joined the ''[[Deutsche Reichspartei]]'' of which [[Hans-Ulrich Rudel]] was the most prominent figure. Younger members founded the ''[[Wiking-Jugend]]'' modeled after the [[Hitler Youth]]. The ''Deutsche Reichspartei'' stood for elections from 1953 until 1961 fetching around 1% of the vote each time.{{cn|date=December 2017}} Rudel befriended French-born [[Savitri Devi]], who was a proponent of [[Esoteric Nazism]]. In the 1950s she wrote a number of books, such as ''[[Pilgrimage (book)|Pilgrimage]]'' (1958), which concerns prominent Third Reich sites, and ''[[The Lightning and the Sun]]'' (1958), in which she claims that Adolf Hitler was an avatar of the God [[Vishnu]]. She was not alone in this reorientation of National Socialism towards its [[Thule Society|Thulean]]-roots; the ''[[Artgemeinschaft]]'', founded by former SS member Wilhelm Kusserow, attempted to promote a new [[paganism]].{{cn|date=December 2017}}

In 1956, Strasser founded the [[German Social Union (West Germany)|German Social Union]] as a Black Front successor, promoting a [[Strasserite]] "nationalist and socialist" policy, which dissolved in 1962 due to lack of support. Other Third Reich associated groups were the [[HIAG]] and [[Stille Hilfe]] dedicated to advancing the interests of [[Waffen-SS]] veterans and rehabilitating them into the new democratic society. However, they did not claim to be attempting to restore National Socialism, instead working with the [[social democrats]] and [[Christian democrats]].

Many bureaucrats who served under the Third Reich continued to serve in German administration after the war.

==="Universal National Socialism", 1950s–1970s===
Neo-Nazism found expression outside of Germany, including in countries who fought against the Third Reich during the Second World War, and sometimes adopted Pan-European or "Universal" characteristics, beyond the parameters of [[German nationalism]].{{cn|date=December 2017}} The two main tendencies, with differing styles and even worldviews, were the followers of the American [[Francis Parker Yockey]], who was fundamentally anti-American and advocated for a [[Pan-European nationalism]] and those of [[George Lincoln Rockwell]] an [[American conservative]].&lt;ref group= "nb"&gt;Some of the fascistic old-guard from the pre-war ultra-nationalist movements were more skeptical of the benefits of the Rockwell-Jordan uniform scene. [[Oswald Mosley]] of the [[Union Movement]] described Jordan as, "a midget trying to walk in the boots of giants." Meanwhile, Yockeyism leaned more to the left than the "official" fascistic Pan-Europeanism of those which would become the [[European Social Movement]]. The latter associated with Mosley, [[Maurice Bardèche]] and others upheld a strictly "neither East, nor West", third position in regards to Soviet and American power.&lt;/ref&gt;{{cn|date=December 2017}}

Yockey, a neo-Spenglerian author, had written ''Imperium: The Philosophy of History and Politics'' (1949) dedicated to "the hero of the twentieth century" (namely, Adolf Hitler) and founded the [[European Liberation Front]]. He was interested more in the destiny of Europe; to this end, he advocated a [[National Bolshevik]]-esque [[Red–green–brown alliance|red-brown alliance]] against [[American culture]] and influenced 1960s figures such as SS-veteran [[Jean-François Thiriart]]. Yockey was also fond of [[Arab nationalism]], in particular [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], as well as this he saw [[Fidel Castro]]'s  [[Cuban Revolution]] as a positive and visited officials there. Yockey's views impressed Otto Ernst Remer and the radical traditionalist philosopher [[Julius Evola]]. He was constantly hounded by the [[FBI]] and was eventually arrested in 1960, before committing suicide. Domestically, Yockey's biggest sympathisers were the [[National Renaissance Party (United States)|National Renaissance Party]], including [[James H. Madole]], [[H. Keith Thompson]] and [[Eustace Mullins]] (''protégé'' of [[Ezra Pound]]) and the [[Liberty Lobby]] of [[Willis Carto]].{{cn|date=December 2017}}

Rockwell, an American conservative, was first politicised by [[anti-communism]] and opposed to [[racial integration]], before becoming [[anti-Jewish]]. In response to his opponents calling him a "Nazi", he theatrically appropriated the aesthetic elements of the NSDAP, to "own" the intended insult. In 1959, Rockwell founded the [[American Nazi Party]] and instructed his members to dress in imitation [[Sturmabteilung|SA]]-style brown shirts, while flying the flag of the Third Reich. In contrast to Yockey, he was pro-American and cooperated with FBI requests, despite the party being targeted under [[COINTELPRO]] due to the mistaken belief that they were agents of Nasser's Egypt during a brief intelligence "brown scare."&lt;ref group= "nb"&gt;While the intelligence claims in regards to the Rockwell's American costume group proved unfounded, a number of actual German National Socialists did relocate to the Middle East, some conveted to Islam and changed their names; particularly Egypt and Syria. This includes [[Johann von Leers]], [[Alois Brunner]], [[Aribert Heim]], [[Franz Stangl]], [[Gerhard Mertins]], [[Hans Eisele (physician)|Hans Eisele]], [[Walter Rauff]], [[Artur Schmitt]] and others. The father of Neo-Nazism, Otto Ernst Remer, also fled to Egypt, then Syria during the 1950s.&lt;/ref&gt; Later leaders of American [[white nationalism]] came to politics through the ANP; including a teenage [[David Duke]] and [[William Luther Pierce]] of the [[National Alliance (United States)|National Alliance]], although they soon distanced themselves from explicit self-identification with neo-Nazism.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

[[File:Flag of Ordine Nuovo.svg|thumb|right|175px|The Italian group [[Ordine Nuovo]], banned in 1974, drew influence from the [[Waffen-SS]] and [[Traditionalist School|Guénonian Traditionalism]] via [[Julius Evola]].]]
[[File:Flag of the Order of Flemish Militants.svg|thumb|right|175px|The radicalisation of Flemish activist group the [[Vlaamse Militanten Orde]] in the 1970s, energised international neo-Nazism.]]

In 1961,  the [[World Union of National Socialists]] was founded by Rockwell and [[Colin Jordan]] of the British [[National Socialist Movement (UK, 1962)|National Socialist Movement]], adopting the ''[[Cotswold Declaration]].'' French socialite [[Françoise Dior]] was involved romantically with Jordan and his deputy [[John Tyndall (politician)|John Tyndall]] and  a friend of Savitri Devi, who also attended the meeting. The National Socialist Movement wore quasi-SA uniforms,  was involved in streets conflicts with the Jewish [[62 Group]]. In the 1970s, Tyndall's earlier involvement with neo-Nazism would come back to haunt the [[National Front (UK)|National Front]], which he led, as they attempted to ride a wave of anti-immigration populism and concerns over British national decline. Televised exposes on ''[[This Week (Thames Television TV series)|This Week]]'' in 1974 and ''[[World in Action]]'' in 1978, showed their neo-Nazi pedigree and damaged their electoral chances. In 1967, Rockwell was killed by a disgruntled former member. [[Matthias Koehl]] took control of the ANP, and strongly influenced by Savitri Devi, gradually transformed it into an esoteric group known as the [[New Order (Neo-Nazi group)|New Order]].{{cn|date=December 2017}}

In [[Franco's Spain]], certain SS refugees most notably [[Otto Skorzeny]], [[Léon Degrelle]] and the son of [[Klaus Barbie]] became associated with [[CEDADE]] (''Círculo Español de Amigos de Europa''), an organisation which disseminated Third Reich apologetics out of [[Barcelona]]. They intersected with neo-Nazi advocates from [[Mark Fredriksen]] in France to [[Salvador Borrego]] in [[Mexico]]. 
In the post-fascist [[Italian Social Movement]] splinter groups such as [[Ordine Nuovo]] and [[Avanguardia Nazionale]], involved in the "[[Years of Lead (Italy)|Years of Lead]]" considered National Socialism a reference. [[Franco Freda]] created a "Nazi-[[Maoist]]" synthesis. 

In Germany itself, the various Third Reich nostalgic movements coalesced around the [[National Democratic Party of Germany]] in 1964 and in Austria the [[National Democratic Party (Austria, 1967–88)|National Democratic Party]] in 1967 as the primary sympathisers of the NSDAP past, although more publicly cautious than earlier groups.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

===Holocaust denial and subcultures, 1970s–1990s===
[[Holocaust denial]], the claim that [[the Holocaust|six million Jews]] were not deliberately and systematically exterminated as an official policy of the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]] and [[Adolf Hitler]], became a more prominent feature of neo-Nazism in the 1970s. Before this time, Holocaust denial had long existed as a sentiment among neo-Nazis, but it had not yet been systematically articulated as a theory with a bibliographical canon. Few of the major theorists of Holocaust denial (who call themselves "[[Historical revisionism|revisionists]]") can be uncontroversially classified as outright neo-Nazis (though some works such as those of [[David Irving]] forward a clearly sympathetic view of Hitler and the publisher [[Ernst Zündel]] was deeply tied to international neo-Nazism), however, the main interest of Holocaust denial to neo-Nazis was their hope that it would help them rehabilitate their political [[ideology]] in the eyes of the general public. ''[[Did Six Million Really Die?]]'' (1974) by [[Richard Verrall]] and ''[[The Hoax of the Twentieth Century]]'' (1976) by [[Arthur Butz]] are popular examples of Holocaust denial material.

Key developments in international neo-Nazism during this time include the radicalisation of the ''[[Vlaamse Militanten Orde]]'' under former [[Hitler Youth]] member [[Bert Eriksson]]. They began hosting an annual conference; the "Iron Pilgrimage"; at [[Diksmuide]], which drew kindred ideologues from across Europe and beyond. As well as this, the [[NSDAP/AO (1972)|NSDAP/AO]] under [[Gary Lauck]] arose in the United States in 1972 and challenged the international influence of the Rockwellite WUNS. Lauck's organisation drew support from the [[National Socialist Movement of Denmark]] of [[Povl Riis-Knudsen]] and various German and Austrian figures who felt that the "National Democratic" parties were too bourgeois and insufficiently National Socialist in orientation. This included [[Michael Kühnen]], [[Christian Worch]], [[Bela Ewald Althans]] and [[Gottfried Küssel]] of the 1977-founded  [[Action Front of National Socialists/National Activists|ANS/NS]] which called for the establishment of a Germanic [[Fourth Reich]]. Some ANS/NS members were imprisoned for planning paramilitary attacks on [[NATO]] bases in Germany and planning to liberate [[Rudolf Hess]] from [[Spandau Prison]]. The organisation was officially banned in 1983 by the Minister of the Interior.

During the late 1970s, a British subculture came to be associated with neo-Nazism; the [[skinheads]]. Portraying an ultra-masculine, crude and aggressive image, with working-class references, some of the skinheads joined the [[British Movement]] under [[Michael McLaughlin]] (successor of [[Colin Jordan]]), while others became associated with the National Front's [[Rock Against Communism]] project which was meant to counter the [[Socialist Workers Party (UK)|SWP]]'s [[Rock Against Racism]]. The most significant music group involved in this project was [[Skrewdriver]], led by [[Ian Stuart Donaldson]]. Together with ex-BM member [[Nicky Crane]], Donaldson founded the international [[Blood &amp; Honour]] network in 1987. By 1992 this network, with input from [[Harold Covington]], had developed a paramilitary wing; [[Combat 18]], which intersected with [[football hooligan]] firms such as the [[Chelsea Headhunters]]. The neo-Nazi skinhead movement spread to the United States, with groups such as the [[Hammerskins]]. It was popularised from 1986 onwards by [[Tom Metzger]] of the [[White Aryan Resistance]]. Since then it has spread across the world. Films such as ''[[Romper Stomper]]'' (1992) and ''[[American History X]]'' (1998) would fix a public perception that [[white power skinheads|neo-Nazism and skinheads]] were synonymous.

[[Image:Black_Sun_2.svg|thumb|175px|left|Serrano identified Aryan-Hyperborean blood as the "light of the [[Black Sun (occult symbol)|Black Sun]]", a symbol found at SS-cult site [[Wewelsburg|Wewelsburg Castle]].]]

New developments also emerged on the esoteric level, as former Chilean diplomat [[Miguel Serrano]] built on the works of [[Carl Jung]], [[Otto Rahn]], [[Wilhelm Landig]], [[Julius Evola]] and [[Savitri Devi]] to bind together and develop already existing theories. Serrano had been a member of the [[National Socialist Movement of Chile]] in the 1930s and from the early days of neo-Nazism he had been in contact with key figures across Europe and beyond. Despite this, he was able to work as an ambassador to numerous countries until the rise of [[Salvador Allende]]. In 1984 he published his book ''Adolf Hitler: The Ultimate Avatar''. Serrano claimed that the Aryans were extragalactic beings who founded [[Hyperborea]] and lived the heroic life of [[Bodhisattvas]], while the [[Jews]] were created by the [[Demiurge]] and were concerned only with coarse [[materialism]]. Serrano claimed that a new [[Golden Age]] can be attained if the Hyperboreans repurify their blood (supposedly the light of the Black Sun) and restore their "[[Genetic memory (psychology)|blood-memory]]." As with Savitri Devi before him, Serrano's works became a key point of reference in neo-Nazism.

===Lifting of the Iron Curtain, 1990s–present===
With the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] and the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]] during the early 1990s, neo-Nazism began to spread its ideas in the East, as hostility to the triumphant liberal order was high and [[revanchism]] a widespread feeling. In Russia, during the chaos of the early 1990s, an amorphous mixture of [[KGB]] hardliners, Orthodox neo-Tsarist nostalgics (i.e. - [[Pamyat]]) and explicit National Socialists found themselves strewn together in the same camp. They were united by opposition to the influence of the United States, against the liberalising legacy of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s ''[[perestroika]]'' and on the [[Jewish question]], [[Soviet Anti-Zionism|Soviet Zionology]] merged with a more explicit anti-Jewish sentiment. The most significant organisation representing this was [[Russian National Unity]] under the leadership of [[Alexander Barkashov]], where black-uniform clad Russians marched with a red flag incorporating the [[Swastika]] under the banner of ''[[Russia for Russians]].'' These forces came together in a last gasp effort to save the [[Supreme Soviet of Russia]] against [[Boris Yeltsin]] during the [[1993 Russian constitutional crisis]]. As well as events in Russia, in newly independent ex-Soviet states, annual commemorations for SS volunteers now took place; particularly in [[Remembrance day of the Latvian legionnaires|Latvia]], [[20th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Estonian)|Estonia]] and the [[14th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Galician)|Ukraine]].

[[Image:Evstafiev-neo-bolsheviks.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Members of the [[National Bolshevik Party]]. The Nazbols tailored ultra-nationalist themes to a native Russian environment, while still flirting with National Socialist aesthetics.]]

The Russian developments excited German neo-Nazism who dreamed of a [[Berlin]]—[[Moscow]] alliance against the supposedly "decadent" [[Atlanticist]] forces; a dream which had been thematic since the days of Remer.&lt;ref name="remer"/&gt; Zündel visited Russia and met with Russian National Unity luminaries such as ex-KGB general Aleksandr Stergilov. Despite these initial aspirations, international neo-Nazism and its close affiliates in ultra-nationalism would be split over the [[Bosnian War]] between 1992 and 1995, as part of the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]]. The split would largely be along ethnic and sectarian lines. The Germans and the French would largely back the Western Catholic [[Croats]] (Lauck's NSDAP/AO explicitly [[Foreign fighters in the Bosnian War|called for volunteers]], which Kühnen's [[Free German Workers' Party]] answered and the French formed the "Groupe [[Jacques Doriot]]"), while the Russians and the Greeks would back the Orthodox [[Serbs]] (including Russians from Barkashov's Russian National Unity, [[Eduard Limonov]]'s [[National Bolshevik Party|National Bolshevik Front]] and [[Golden Dawn (political party)|Golden Dawn]] members joined the [[Greek Volunteer Guard]]). Indeed, the revival of [[National Bolshevism]] was able to steal some of the thunder from overt Russian neo-Nazism, as ultra-nationalism was wedded with veneration of [[Joseph Stalin]] in place of Adolf Hitler, while still also flirting with National Socialist aesthetics.

==Analogous European movements==
Outside Germany, in other countries which were involved with the [[Axis powers]] and had their own native ultra-nationalist movements, which sometimes collaborated with the Third Reich but were not technically German-style National Socialists, revivalist and nostalgic movements have emerged in the post-war period which, as neo-Nazism has done in Germany, seek to rehabilitate their various loosely associated ideologies. These movements include [[neo-fascists]] and [[post-fascists]] in Italy; Vichyites, Pétainists and "national Europeans" in France; [[Ustaše]] sympathisers in [[Croatia]]; neo-[[Chetniks]] in [[Serbia]]; [[Iron Guard]] revivalists in [[Romania]]; [[Hungarists]] and [[Miklós Horthy|Horthyists]] in [[Hungary]]; [[Stepan Bandera|Banderaists]] in the [[Ukraine]] (which had a complicated relationship with the Axis powers) and others.

===Italy===
[[File:Junio Valerio Borghese.jpg|thumb|187px|The nearest Italy came to returning to [[fascism]] was the 1970 [[Golpe Borghese]] of commando veteran [[Junio Valerio Borghese]].]]

Following the last stand of [[Italian fascism]] with the German-supported [[Italian Social Republic]] towards the end of the Second World War, those elements within Italian society which remained loyal to the legacy of [[Benito Mussolini]] and fascism (especially veterans of the [[National Republican Army]]), rejecting both the [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Catholic]] and [[Italian Communist Party|Communist]] alternatives prominent in mainstream Italian politics, founded the [[Italian Social Movement]] in 1946 under [[Giorgio Almirante]]. The MSI was regarded as the successor of the [[National Fascist Party]] and the [[Republican Fascist Party]]. The motto of the party was "not repudiate, not restore", indicating a more moderate parliamentary democratic [[neo-fascism]], which did not heap scorn on the recent past. Italian society did not undergo a process as extensive as the post-war Denazification campaign in occupied Germany, partly due to the [[Cold War]] and the Western Allies not wanting Italy to move towards the [[Warsaw Pact]] (which was not an [[Popular Democratic Front (Italy)|impossibility at the time]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Alessandra Kersevan]]2008: (Editor) Foibe - Revisionismo di stato e amnesie della repubblica.

The Italian Social Movement held a similar position in Italian politics that the [[National Democratic Party of Germany]] did in Germany; careful enough to stay within the laws of the new democratic state, but still clearly identified with the Axis legacy. During the 1950s, the MSI moved closer to bourgeois conservative politics on the domestic front, which led to radical youths founding hardline splinter groups, such as [[Pino Rauti]]'s [[Ordine Nuovo]] (later succeeded by [[Ordine Nero]]) and  [[Stefano Delle Chiaie]]'s [[National Vanguard (Italy)|Avanguardia Nazionale]]. These organisations were influenced by the esotericism of [[Julius Evola]] and considered the Waffen-SS and Romanian leader [[Corneliu Zelea Codreanu]] a reference, moving beyond Italian fascism. They were implicated in [[Years of Lead (Italy)|paramiliary attacks]] during the late 1960s to the early 1980s, such as the [[Piazza Fontana bombing]]. Delle Chiaie had even assisted [[Junio Valerio Borghese]] in a failed 1970 coup attempt known as the [[Golpe Borghese]], which attempted to reinstate a fascist state in Italy.

During the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Italian Social Movement under the leadership of [[Gianfranco Fini]] moved closer to conservative politics, adopting a "post-fascist" position. This was opposed by the fascist element under Rauti who created [[Fiamma Tricolore]] in 1995. The party was dissolved under Fini in 1995, who replaced it with the [[National Alliance (Italy)|National Alliance]]. This party rapidly moved away from any connection to the fascist past, towards the center-right in coalition with [[Silvio Berlusconi]]'s [[Forza Italia]]. The two parties merged in 2009 to become [[The People of Freedom]]. [[Alessandra Mussolini]], troubled by Fini's explicit condemnation of her grandfather broke with the AN to found [[Social Action]]. Aside from Fiamma Tricolore, the other extant neo-fascist groups in Italy are [[New Force (Italy)|Forza Nuova]], the [[National Social Front|Fronte Nazionale]], [[Social Idea Movement|Movimento Idea Sociale]] (another Rauti creation) and the cultural ''[[CasaPound]]'' project. In terms of current size, they are mostly negligible.

===France===
{{Main article|History of far-right movements in France}}
[[File:Celtic-style crossed circle.svg|thumb|175px|French neo-fascist groups adopted the [[Celtic cross]] as an ambiguous "Christian and pagan" symbol since the 1940s.|left]]

In France, the most enthusiastic collaborationists during the [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|German occupation of France]] had been the [[National Popular Rally]] of [[Marcel Déat]] (former [[French Section of the Workers' International|SFIO]] members) and the [[French Popular Party]] of [[Jacques Doriot]] (former [[French Communist Party]] members). These two groups, like the Germans, saw themselves as combining ultra-nationalism and [[socialism]]. In the south there existed the vassal state of [[Vichy France]] under the military "Hero of the Verdun", Marshal [[Philippe Pétain]] whose ''[[Révolution nationale]]'' emphasised an authoritarian Catholic conservative politics. Following the [[liberation of France]] and the creation of the [[Fourth French Republic]], collaborationists were prosecuted during the ''[[épuration légale]]'' and nearly 800 put to death for treason under [[Charles de Gaulle]].

In the aftermath of the Second World War, the main concern of the French radical right was the collapse of the [[French colonial empire|French Empire]], in particular the [[Algerian War]], which led to the creation of the [[Organisation armée secrète|OAS]]. Outside of this, individual fascistic activists such as [[Maurice Bardèche]] (brother-in-law of [[Robert Brasillach]]), as well as SS-veterans [[Marc Augier|Saint-Loup]] and [[René Binet (neo-Fascist)|René Binet]],  were active in France and involved in the [[European Social Movement]] and later the [[New European Order]], alongside similar groups from across Europe. Early neo-fascist groups included [[Jeune Nation]], which introduced the [[Celtic cross]] into use by radical right groups (an association which would spread internationally). A "neither East, nor West" pan-Europeanism was most popular among French fascistic activists until the late 1960s, partly motivated by feelings of national vulnerability following the collapse of their empire; thus the Belgian SS-veteran [[Jean-François Thiriart]]'s group [[Jeune Europe]] also had a considerable French contingent.

It was the 1960s, during the [[Fifth French Republic]], that a considerable upturn in French neo-fascism occurred; some of it in response to the [[Protests of 1968]]. The most explicitly pro-Nazi of these was the [[Fédération d'action nationale et européenne|FANE]] of [[Mark Fredriksen]]. Neo-fascist groups included [[Pierre Sidos]]' [[Occident (movement)|Occident]], the [[Ordre Nouveau (1960s)|Ordre Nouveau]] (which was banned after violent clashes with the Trotskyist [[Revolutionary Communist League (France)|LCR]]) and the student-based [[Groupe Union Défense]]. A number of these activists such as [[François Duprat]] were instrumental in founding the [[National Front (France)|Front National]] under [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]]; but the FN also included a broader selection from the French hard-right, including not only these neo-fascist elements, but also [[Integrism|Catholic integrists]], monarchists, Algerian War veterans, [[Poujadists]] and national-conservatives. Others from these neo-fascist micro-groups formed the [[Parti des forces nouvelles]] working against Le Pen.

Within the FN itself, Duprat founded the FANE-backed [[Revolutionary Nationalist Groups|Groupes nationalistes révolutionnaires]] faction, until his 1978 assassination. The subsequent history of the French hard right has been the conflict between the national-conservative controlled FN and "national revolutionary" (fascistic and National Bolshevik) splinter or opposition groups. The latter include groups in the tradition of Thiriart and Duprat, such as the [[Parti communautaire national-européen]], [[Troisième voie]], the [[Nouvelle Résistance]] of [[Christian Bouchet]],&lt;ref name=Banquet&gt;[http://www.revue-lebanquet.com/docs/a_0000362.html Stratégies et pratiques du mouvement nationaliste-révolutionnaire français : départs, desseins et destin d'Unité Radicale (1989–2002)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929082901/http://www.revue-lebanquet.com/docs/a_0000362.html |date=29 September 2007 }}, ''Le Banquet,'' n°19, 2004 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Unité Radicale]] and most recently [[Bloc identitaire]].

===Hungary===
[[File:Becsület napja 1997-02-15.jpg|thumb|250px|"Hungaria Skins" with a flag evoking the Arrow Cross in 1997.|left]]

In Hungary, the historical political party which allied itself ideologically with German National Socialism and drew inspiration from it, was the [[Arrow Cross Party]] of [[Ferenc Szálasi]]. They referred to themselves explicitly as National Socialists and within Hungarian politics this tendency is known as [[Hungarism]].{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} After the Second World War, exiles such as [[Árpád Henney]] kept the Hungarist tradition alive. Following the fall of the [[Hungarian People's Republic]] in 1989, which was a [[Marxist-Leninist]] state and a member of the [[Warsaw Pact]], many new parties emerged. Amongst these was the [[Hungarian National Front]] of [[István Győrkös]], which was a Hungarist party and considered itself the heirs of Arrow Cross-style National Socialism (a self-description they explicitly embraced);{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} it forged links with [[Gottfried Küssel]] and the NSDAP/AO.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} In the 2000s, Győrkös' movement moved closer to a [[national communist]] and [[neo-Eurasian]] position, aligned with [[Aleksandr Dugin]], cooperating with the [[Hungarian Workers' Party]]. Some Hungarists opposed this and founded the [[Pax Hungarica Movement]]. 

In modern Hungary, the ultranationalist [[Jobbik]] is regarded by some scholars as a neo-Nazi party; for example, it has been termed as such by [[Randolph L. Braham]].&lt;ref&gt;Randolph L. Braham, "Hungary: The Assault on the Historical Memory of the Holocaust" in ''The Holocaust in Hungary: Seventy Years Later'' (eds. Randolph L. Braham &amp; András Kovács:  Central European University Press, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; The party denies being neo-Nazi, although "there is extensive proof that the leading members of the party made no effort to hide their racism and anti-Semitism."&lt;ref name="Spectrum"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://hungarianspectrum.org/2013/04/08/jobbik-is-not-a-neo-nazi-party-at-least-not-according-to-a-hungarian-judge/|publisher=Hungarian Spectrum|title=Jobbik is not a neo-Nazi party. At least not according to a Hungarian judge|work=Hungarian Spectrum|date=8 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rudolf Paksa, a scholar of the Hungarian far right, describes Jobbik as "anti-Semitic, racist, homophobic and chauvinistic" but not as neo-Nazi because it does not pursue the establishment of a totalitarian regime.&lt;ref name="Spectrum"/&gt; Historian [[Krisztián Ungváry]] writes that "It is safe to say that certain messages of Jobbik can be called open neo-Nazi propaganda. However, it is quite certain that the popularity of the party is not due to these statements."&lt;ref&gt;Krisztián Ungváry, "'One Camp, One Banner': How Fidesz Views History" in ''Twenty-Five Sides of a Post-Communist Mafia State'' (ed. Balint Magyar &amp; Julia Vasarhelyi: Central European University Press, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Romania===
In Romania, the ultra-nationalist movement which allied itself with the [[Axis powers]] and German National Socialism was the [[Iron Guard]], also known as the Legion of the Archangel Michael. There are some modern political organisations which consider themselves heirs of Legionarism, this includes [[Noua Dreaptă]] and the [["Everything For the Country" Party]], founded by former Iron Guard members. The latter organisation was outlawed in 2015. Aside, from these Romanian organisations, the [[Sixty-Four Counties Youth Movement]] representing ultra-nationalism from the Hungarian minority is also present, especially in [[Transylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Luiza Ilie |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/us-romania-prosecutors-blast-idUSKBN0TK4YD20151201 |title=Romanian prosecutors arrest suspect for attempted blast |newspaper=Reuters |accessdate=2016-02-26|date= December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other nationalistic and irridentist groups such as the [[Greater Romania Party]] do not originate from Legionarism, but in fact grew out of [[national communist]] tendencies from the era of [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]] (the party was founded by his "court poet" [[Corneliu Vadim Tudor]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Markéta Smrčková |url=http://www.cepsr.com/clanek.php?ID=360 |title=Comparison of Radical Right-Wing Parties in Bulgaria and Romania |publisher=Central European Political Studies Review |accessdate=2016-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues==
===Ex-Nazis in mainstream politics===
[[Image:Kurt Waldheim 1971b.jpg|thumb|right|187px|The 1980s dispute between Austrian president [[Kurt Waldheim]] and the [[World Jewish Congress]] caused an international incident.]]

The most significant case on an international level was the election of [[Kurt Waldheim]] to the Presidency of Austria in 1986. It came to light that Waldheim had been a member of the [[National Socialist German Students' League]], the SA and served as an intelligence officer during the Second World War. Following this he served as an Austrian diplomat and was the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]] from 1972 until 1981. After revelations of Waldheim's past were made by an Austrian journalist, Waldheim clashed with the [[World Jewish Congress]] on the international stage. Waldheim's record was defended by [[Bruno Kreisky]], an Austrian Jew who served as Chancellor of Austria. The legacy of the affair lingers on, as [[Victor Ostrovsky]] has claimed the [[Mossad]] doctored the file of Waldheim to implicate him in war crimes.

===Contemporary right-wing populism===
Some critics have sought to draw a connection between Nazism and modern [[right-wing populism]] in Europe, but the two are not widely regarded as interchangeable by most academics. In Austria, the [[Freedom Party of Austria]] (FPÖ) served as a shelter for ex-Nazis almost from its inception.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} In 1980, scandals undermined Austria's two main parties and the economy stagnated. [[Jörg Haider]] became leader of the FPÖ and offered partial justification for [[Nazism]], calling its employment policy effective. In the [[Austrian legislative election, 1994|1994 Austrian election]], the FPÖ won 22 percent of the vote, as well as 33 percent of the vote in [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]] and 22 percent in Vienna; showing that it had become a force capable of reversing the old pattern of Austrian politics.&lt;ref&gt;Laqueur, Walter, ''Fascism: Past, Present, Future'', pp. 80, 116, 117&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Walter Laqueur]] writes that even though Haider welcomed former Nazis at his meetings and went out of his way to address [[Schutzstaffel]] (SS) veterans, the FPÖ is not a fascist party in the traditional sense, since it has not made [[anti-communism]] an important issue, and it does not advocate the overthrow of the democratic order or the use of violence. In his view, the FPÖ is "not quite fascist", although it is part of a tradition, similar to that of 19th-century Viennese mayor [[Karl Lueger]], which involves [[nationalism]], xenophobic populism, and [[authoritarianism]].&lt;ref&gt;Laqueur, Walter, ''Fascism: Past, Present, Future'', p. 117-118&lt;/ref&gt; Haider, who in 2005 left the Freedom Party and formed the [[Alliance for Austria's Future]], was killed in a traffic accident in October 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7664846.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Austria's Haider dies in accident | date=2008-10-11 | accessdate=2010-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Barbara Rosenkranz]], the Freedom Party's candidate for the [[Austrian presidential election, 2010]], is controversial for having made allegedly pro-Nazi statements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8634796.stm | publisher=BBC News | title=Austria spooked by Nazi past in election | date=2010-04-23 | accessdate=2010-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rosenkranz is married to [[Horst Rosenkranz]], a key member of a banned neo-Nazi party, who is known for publishing far-right books.

A Belgian neo-Nazi organization, [[Bloed, Bodem, Eer en Trouw]] (Blood, Soil, Honour and Loyalty), was created in 2004 after splitting from the international network ([[Blood and Honour]]). The group rose to public prominence in September 2006, after 17 members (including 11 soldiers) were arrested under the December 2003 [[Anti-terrorism legislation|anti-terrorist laws]] and laws against [[racism]], [[antisemitism]] and supporters of [[censorship]]. According to Justice Minister [[Laurette Onkelinx]] and Interior Minister [[Patrick Dewael]], the suspects (11 of whom were members of the military) were preparing to launch terrorist attacks in order to "destabilize" [[Belgium]].&lt;ref&gt;

====Bosnia and Herzegovina====
The neo-Nazi [[white nationalism|white nationalist]] organization Bosanski Pokret Nacionalnog Ponosa ([[Bosnian Movement of National Pride]]) was founded in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] in July 2009.

====Czech Republic====
The government of the [[Czech Republic]] strictly punishes neo-Nazism ([[Czech language|Czech]]: ''Neonacismus''). According to a report by the [[Ministry of the Interior of the Czech Republic]], neo-Nazis committed more than 211 crimes in 2013. The Czech Republic has various neo-Nazi groups. One of them is the group Wotan Jugend, based in Germany.

Following the failure of the [[National Democratic Party of Germany]] in the [[West German federal election, 1969|election of 1969]], small groups committed to the revival of Nazi ideology began to emerge in Germany. The NPD splintered following the election giving rise to paramilitary ''Wehrsportgruppe''. These groups attempted to organize under a national umbrella organization called the [[Action Front of National Socialists/National Activists]].&lt;ref name=virchow&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1080/0031322032000185587| issn = 0031322X| volume = 38| issue = 1| pages = 56–70| last = Virchow| first = Fabian| title = The groupuscularization of neo-Nazism in Germany: the case of the Aktionsbüro Norddeutschland| journal = Patterns of Prejudice| date = 2004| via=[[EBSCOhost]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neo-Nazi movements in [[East Germany]] were borne of rebellion against the Communist regime; the banning of Nazi symbols created fertile ground for neo-Nazism, then in its infancy, to develop as an [[anti-authoritarian]] youth movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.3167/ej.2000.330206| issn = 0014-3006, 1752-2323| volume = 33| issue = 2| pages = 45–50| last = Brothers| first = Eric| title = Issues Surrounding the Development of the Neo-Nazi Scene in East Berlin| journal = European Judaism| accessdate = 2018-11-12| date = 2000-09-01| url = http://berghahnjournals.com/view/journals/european-judaism/33/2/ej330206.xml}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bands like [[Skrewdriver]] served as tools for far-right recruitment; mail order networks developed to send [[verböten]] Nazi-themed music [[Compact Cassette|cassette]]s and merchandise to Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = A cultural history of neo-Nazi rock| accessdate = 2018-11-12| url = https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/music/a-cultural-history-of-neo-nazi-rock/article4468118/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Turks in Germany]] have been victims of neo-Nazi violence on several occasions.

The German intelligence services have been criticized for extravagant distributions of cash to informants within the far right movement. Tino Brandt publicly boasted on television that he had received around €100,000 in funding from the German state. Though Brandt did not give the state "useful information", the funding supported recruitment efforts in Thuringia during the early 1990s. (Brandt was eventually sentenced to five and a half years in prison on for 66 counts of [[child prostitution]] and [[child sexual abuse]]).&lt;ref name=meaney /&gt;  

Police were only able to locate the killers when they were tipped off following a botched bank robbery in [[Eisenach]]. As the police closed in on them, the two men committed [[suicide]]. They had evaded capture for 13 years. [[Beate Zschäpe]], who had been living with the two men in [[Zwickau]], turned herself in to the German authorities a few days later.  Zschäpe's trial began in May 2013; she was charged with nine counts of [[murder]]. She plead "not guilty". According to ''[[The Guardian]]'', the NSU may have enjoyed protection and support from certain "elements of the state".

In April 1967, a few weeks prior to an election, a military coup d'état took place in Greece and a fascist military government ruled the country from 1967 to 1974. It was called the "[[Greek military junta of 1967–74|Regime of the Colonels]]", and was headed by Colonel [[Georgios Papadopoulos]]. The official reason given for the coup was that a "communist conspiracy" had infiltrated all levels of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.athensinfoguide.com/history/t9-97-2junta.htm|title=Military Junta in Greece - Athens Info Guide|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there have been persistent rumors about an active support of the coup by the U.S. government, there is no evidence to support such claims.&lt;ref&gt;Moseley, Ray (17 November 1999).

There is often collaboration between the state and neo-Nazi elements in Greece.&lt;ref name=dalakoglou /&gt; In 2018, during the trial of sixty-nine members of the Golden Dawn party, evidence was presented of the close ties between the party and the [[Hellenic Police]].&lt;ref name=aj&gt;{{Cite web| title = Tapped phone calls further reveal Golden Dawn's police ties| accessdate = 2018-11-12| url = https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/04/tapped-phone-calls-reveal-golden-dawns-police-ties-180419212215599.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Golden Dawn received 6.92% of the votes in the June election and entered the [[Greek parliament]] with 18 representatives.

Since 2008, neo-Nazi violence in Greece has targeted [[Immigration to Greece|immigrants]], [[leftist]]s and [[anarchist]] activists.  In 2009, certain far right groups announced that [[Agios Panteleimonas, Athens|Agios Panteleimonas]] in [[Athens]] was off limits to immigrants.

====Hungary====
The [[Hungarian Guard]] is a neo-Nazi [[paramilitary]] organization in [[Hungary]]. The Guard was modelled on the [[Arrow Cross Party]], which participated in the murder of Jews and Gypsies during the Holocaust. It serves as a paramilitary force for the far right [[Jobbik party]]. Gypsy homes have been targeted by night time [[death squads]] who throw a [[molotov cocktail]] through the window and then open fire on the inhabitants as they flee their burning homes. The Chief of Police in [[Miskolc]] has made public statements that "Hungarian and Gypsy cultures can't mix".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| issn = 00107565| volume = 291| issue = 1694| pages = 280| last = Land| first = Thomas| title = Disappointed Eastern Europe Confronts Its Neo-Nazis| journal = Contemporary Review| date = 2009| via=[[EBSCOhost]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Netherlands====
The Coordination Forum for Countering Antisemitism reports that on 17 May 2011 in [[Leek, Netherlands|Leek]], [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]], antisemitic graffiti was found at a Jewish school.

====Poland====
[[File:ONR poznan.jpg|thumb|250px|ONR march in [[Poznań]] in November 2015]]

Under the [[Polish Constitution]] promoting any totalitarian system such as [[Nazism]] and [[fascism]] (as well as [[communism]]) as well as inciting violence and/or racial hatred is illegal.&lt;ref&gt;[[Polish Constitution]] (Dz.U. z 1997 r. Nr 78, poz. 483)&lt;/ref&gt; This was further re-enforced in the [[Polish Penal Code]] where discrediting any group or persons on national, religious, racial or religious grounds carries a sentence of 3 years.&lt;ref&gt;[[Polish Penal Code]] (Dz.U. z 2017 r. poz. 2204, z późn. zm.; Art 256 &amp; Art 257)&lt;/ref&gt;

Although several small far-right and anti-semitic organisations exist, most notably [[National Revival of Poland|NOP]] and [[National Radical Camp (1993)|ONR]] (both of which exist legally), they frequently adhere to [[Polish nationalism]] and [[National Democracy]], in which Nazism is generally considered to be against [[ultra-nationalism|ultra-nationalist]] principles, and although they are classed as [[Nationalism|nationalist]] and [[fascism|fascist]] movements, they are at the same time considered anti-Nazi. Some of their elements may resemble neo-Nazi features, but these groups frequently dissociate themselves from Nazi elements, claiming that such acts are unpatriotic and they argue that Nazism misappropriated or slightly altered several pre-existing symbols and features, such as distinguishing the [[Roman salute]] from the [[Nazi salute]].&lt;ref name="dziennik.pl(2008-06-21)"&gt;PAP (2008-06-21), [http://www.dziennik.pl/wydarzenia/article195823 Faszystowskie gesty w Myślenicach.] ''Dziennik.pl'' Kraj. Retrieved 25 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-declared neo-nazi movements in Poland frequently treat Polish culture and traditions with contempt, are [[anti-Christian]] and translate various texts from German, meaning they are considered movements favouring [[Germanisation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Olgierd Grott|title= Faszyści i narodowi socjaliści w Polsce| publisher= Nomos|location= Kraków|year= 2007 |page= 344|isbn= 978-83-60490-19-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

According to several reporter investigations the Polish government turns a blind eye to these groups and they are free to spread their ideology, frequently dismissing their existence as [[conspiracy theories]], dismissing acts political provocations, deeming them too insignificant to pose a threat, or [[Apologetics|attempting to justify or diminish the seriousness of their actions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://wiadomosci.wp.pl/polscy-neonazisci-zdemaskowani-sympatycy-pis-widza-w-tym-spisek-6212049554433665a | title=Polscy neonaziści zdemaskowani.

====Russia====
{{Main article|Racism in Russia|Radical nationalism in Russia}}

There are a few Russian neo-Nazis that openly admire [[Adolf Hitler]] and use the [[swastika]] as their symbol. Russian neo-Nazis are characterized by [[racism]], [[antisemitism]], [[homophobia]], [[Islamophobia]] and extreme [[xenophobia]] towards people from [[Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=4 mei 2008 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLUxuq-E9yA |title=Horrific Documentary on Russian Neo-Nazis part 1 |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=2009-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their ideology centers on defending Russian national identity against what they perceive as a takeover by minority groups such as [[Jew]]s, [[Peoples of the Caucasus|Caucasians]], gay people, [[Central Asia]]ns, [[East Asia]]ns, [[Romani people|Roma people]] (gypsies), and Muslims. There is also a widespread gay rights Nazi skinhead subculture with its own Vkontakte group, GASH, and an alleged 1700 members in Moscow alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/gr/read/meet-russias-gay-aryan-skinheads-finally-bringing-homosexuality-to-the-neo-nazi-world|title=An Interview with a Gay, Russian Neo-Nazi|website=Vice|date=2013-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Neo-Nazism in Russia (2010).jpg|thumb|187px|left|Neo-Nazism in Russia: The photograph was taken at an anti-gay demonstration in Moscow in October 2010]]

Russian neo-Nazis have made it an explicit goal to take over the country by force, and have put serious effort into preparing for this. [[Paramilitary]] organizations operating under the guise of sports clubs have trained their members in squad tactics, [[hand to hand combat]] and weapons handling. They have stockpiled and used weapons, often illegally.

Some observers have noted a subjective irony of Russians embracing Nazism, because one of Hitler's ambitions at the start of [[World War II]] was the [[Generalplan Ost]] (Master Plan East) which envisaged to exterminate, expel, or enslave most or all Slavs from central and eastern Europe (e.g., Russians, Ukrainians, Poles etc.).&lt;ref name=William1&gt;[[William W. Hagen]] (2012). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=zBgr3kL-PP4C&amp;pg=&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false German History in Modern Times: Four Lives of the Nation]''. Cambridge University Press. p. 313. {{ISBN|0-521-19190-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russian neo-Nazis deny the authenticity of this plan and instead emphasize the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact|1939-1941 Nazi-Soviet non-aggression pact]].&lt;ref name=William1 /&gt; At the end of the [[Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union]], over 25 million Soviet citizens had died.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwtwo/soviet_german_war_01.shtml The Soviet-German War 1941 - 1945]". BBC - History.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2007 news story, ''ABC News'' reported, "In a country that lost more people defeating the Nazis than any other country, there are now an estimated 50,000 to 70,000 neo-Nazis, half of the world's total."&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/story?id=3718255&amp;page=1 "Violence 'in the Name of the Nation'"]. ''[[ABC News]]''. October 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991 caused great economic and social problems, including widespread [[unemployment]] and [[poverty]]. Several [[far right]] [[paramilitary]] organizations were able to tap into popular discontent, particularly among marginalized, lesser educated and unemployed youths. Of the three major age groups — youths, adults, and the elderly — youths may have been hit the hardest. The elderly suffered due to inadequate (or unpaid) pensions, but they found effective political representation in the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation|Communist Party]], and generally had their concerns addressed through better budget allocations. Adults, although often suffering financially and psychologically due to job losses, were generally able to find new sources of income.

[[Russian National Unity]] (RNE), founded in 1990 and led by [[Alexander Barkashov]], has claimed to have members in 250 cities. RNE adopted the swastika as its symbol, and sees itself as the avant-garde of a coming national revolution. It is critical of other major far right organizations, such as the [[Liberal Democratic Party of Russia]] (LDPR). Historian Walter Laqueur calls RNE far closer to the Nazi model than the LDPR. RNE publishes several news sheets; one of them, ''Russky poryadok'', claims to have a circulation of 150,000. Full members of RNE are called Soratnik (comrades in arms), receive combat training at locations near Moscow, and many of them work as security officers or armed guards.&lt;ref&gt;Laqueur, Walter, ''Fascism: Past, Present, Future'', p. 189&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 August 2007, Russian authorities arrested a student for allegedly posting a video on the Internet which appears to show two migrant workers being beheaded in front of a red and black swastika flag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6946810.stm |title=Russian held over 'deaths' video |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-08-15 |accessdate=2009-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander Verkhovsky, the head of a Moscow-based center that monitors [[hate crime]] in Russia, said, "It looks like this is the real thing. The killing is genuine ... There are similar videos from the Chechen war. But this is the first time the killing appears to have been done intentionally."&lt;ref name="execution"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/russia/article/0,,2149611,00.html|title=Student arrested over Russian neo-Nazi 'execution' video|author=Luke Harding|publisher=The Guardian|date=2007-08-16|accessdate=2007-08-16 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sweden====
Neo-Nazi activities in [[Sweden]] have previously been limited to [[White supremacy|white supremacist]] groups, few of which have a membership over a few hundred members.&lt;ref&gt;Laqueur, Walter, ''Fascism: Past, Present, Future'', p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; The main neo-Nazi organization as of 2017 is the [[Nordic Resistance Movement]]. Nordic Resistance Movement self-identifies as a [[National Socialist]] political movement with a parliamentary branch. They are also active in [[Norway]], [[Finland]], and [[Denmark]].

====Switzerland====

====Pakistan====
Pro-Nazi sentiment is widespread in Pakistan, according to the German magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', compounded by the anti-Semitism engendered by the opposition to Israel and support for Palestine general throughout the region.

Neo-Nazi activity is not common or widespread in [[Israel]], and the few reported activities have all been the work of extremists, who were punished severely.

====Canada====
[[Neo-Nazism in Canada]] began with the formation of the [[Canadian Nazi Party]] in 1965. In the 1970s and 1980s, neo-Nazism continued to spread in the country as organizations including the [[Western Guard Party]] and [[Creativity (religion)|Church of the Creator]] (later renamed ''Creativity'') promoted white supremacist ideals.&lt;ref name= source2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nizkor.org/|title=Holocaust Educational Resource|publisher=nizkor.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in the United States in 1973, Creativity calls for [[white people]] to wage [[Ben Klassen#Racial holy war|racial holy war]] (Rahowa) against Jews and other perceived enemies.&lt;ref name= source14&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Berlet | first1 = Chip | last2 = Vysotsky | first2 = Stanislav | year = 2006 | title = Overview of U.S. White Supremacist Groups | url = | journal = Journal of Political and Military Sociology | volume = 34 | issue = 1| pages = 11–48 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Don Andrews]] founded the [[Nationalist Party of Canada]] in 1977. The purported goals of the unregistered party are "the promotion and maintenance of European Heritage and Culture in Canada," but the party is known for anti-Semitism and racism. Many influential neo-Nazi Leaders, such as [[Wolfgang Droege]], were affiliated with the party, but many of its members left to join the Heritage Front, which was founded in 1989.&lt;ref name= source3/&gt;

Droege founded the [[Heritage Front]] in [[Toronto]] at a time when leaders of the white supremacist movement were "disgruntled about the state of the radical right" and wanted to unite unorganized groups of white supremacists into an influential and efficient group with common objectives.&lt;ref name= source3/&gt;  Plans for the organization began in September 1989, and the formation of the Heritage Front was formally announced a couple of months later in November. In the 1990s, [[George Burdi]] of [[Resistance Records]] and the band [[Rahowa (band)|Rahowa]] popularized the Creativity movement and the [[white power music]] scene.&lt;ref name=source1&gt;Hamm, Mark S. ''American Skinheads: The Criminology and Control of Hate Crime''. Westport, CT: Praeger Publishers, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=October 2016}}

Controversy and dissention has left many Canadian neo-Nazi organizations dissolved or weakened.&lt;ref name= source3&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Burstow | first1 = Bonnie | year = 2003 | title = Surviving and thriving by becoming more 'groupuscular': the case of the Heritage Front | url = | journal = Patterns of Prejudice | volume = 37 | issue = 4| pages = 415–428 | doi=10.1080/0031322032000144492}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chile====
{{main article|Nazism in Chile}}
[[File:Flag_of_National_Socialist_Movement_of_Chile.svg|thumb|upright|Flag of the [[National Socialist Movement of Chile]]]]
After the dissolution of the [[National Socialist Movement of Chile]] (MNSCH) in 1938, notable former members of MNSCH migrated into [[Partido Agrario Laborista]] (PAL), obtaining high positions.&lt;ref name=etche&gt;Etchepare, Jaime Antonio; Stewart; Hamish I., ''Nazism in Chile: A Particular Type of Fascism in South America. ''[[Journal of Contemporary History]]'' (1995).&lt;/ref&gt; Not all former MNSCH members joined the PAL; some continued to form parties that followed the MNSCH model until 1952.&lt;ref name=etche/&gt; A new old-school Nazi party was formed in 1964 by school teacher [[Franz Pfeiffer]].&lt;ref name=etche/&gt; Among the activities of this group were the organization of a ''Miss Nazi'' beauty contest and the formation of a Chilean branch of the [[Ku Klux Klan]].&lt;ref name=etche/&gt; The party disbanded in 1970. Pfeiffer attempted to restart it in 1983 in the wake of a wave of protests against the [[Chile under Pinochet|Augusto Pinochet regime]].&lt;ref name=etche/&gt;

[[Nicolás Palacios]] considered the "Chilean race" to be a mix of two bellicose master races: the [[Visigoth]]s of Spain and the [[Mapuche]] (Araucanians) of Chile.&lt;ref name=palaciosmestizo&gt;[[Nicolás Palacios|Palacios, Nicolás]], ''Raza Chilena'' (Editorial Chilena, 1918), pp. 35—36.&lt;/ref&gt;  Palacios traces the origins of the Spanish component of the "Chilean race" to the coast of the [[Baltic Sea]], specifically to [[Götaland]] in [[Sweden]],&lt;ref name=palaciosmestizo/&gt; one of the supposed [[homeland]]s of the [[Goths]]. Palacios claimed that both the blonde-haired and the bronze-coloured Chilean [[Mestizo]] share a "moral physonomy" and a masculine psychology.&lt;ref name=palaciospsico&gt;[[Nicolás Palacios|Palacios, Nicolás]], ''Raza Chilena'' (Editorial Chilena, 1918), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; He opposed immigration from [[Southern Europe]], and argued that Mestizos who are derived from south Europeans lack "cerebral control" and are a social burden.&lt;ref name=palacioslatino&gt;[[Nicolás Palacios|Palacios, Nicolás]], ''Raza Chilena'' (Editorial Chilena, 1918), p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Costa Rica ====
Several neo-Nazi groups exist in [[Costa Rica]]. The first to receive attention was the [[Costa Rican National Socialist Party]], which is now disbanded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wvw.nacion.com/ln_ee/2003/noviembre/09/pais3.html |title=nacion.com / Nacionales |publisher=Wvw.nacion.com |accessdate=2012-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others include Costa Rican National Socialist Youth, Costa Rican National Socialist Alliance, New Social Order, Costa Rican National Socialist Resistance (which is Costa Rica's member of the [[World Union of National Socialists]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationalsocialist.net/members.htm |title=World Union of National Socialists Membership Directory : W.U.N.S. |publisher=Nationalsocialist.net |accessdate=2012-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Hiperborean Spear Society. The groups normally target [[Jewish]]-[[Costa Ricans]], [[Afro-Costa Rican]]s, [[communism|Communists]], gay people and especially [[Nicaragua]]n and [[Colombian people|Colombian]] immigrants. The media has discovered the existence of an underground neo-Nazi group inside the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nacion.com/2012-04-16/Sucesos/null.aspx |title=Fuerza Pública investiga fotos de policía en Facebook - SUCESOS - |newspaper=La Nación |date=2012-04-16 |accessdate=2012-11-07 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120702214252/http://www.nacion.com/2012-04-16/Sucesos/null.aspx |archivedate=2 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====
[[File:National Socialist Movement Rally US Capitol.jpg|thumb|250px|The NSM rally on the West lawn of the [[United States Capitol|US Capitol]], Washington DC, 2008]]

There are several neo-Nazi groups in the United States. The [[National Socialist Movement (United States)|National Socialist Movement]] (NSM), with about 400 members in 32 states,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/11/us/11nazi.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all "Neo-Nazi Father Is Killed; Son, 10, Steeped in Beliefs, Is Accused"]. ''The New York Times''. 10 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; is currently the largest neo-Nazi organization in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adl.org/Learn/Ext_US/nsm/default.asp?LEARN_Cat=Extremism&amp;LEARN_SubCat=Extremism_in_America&amp;xpicked=3&amp;item=nsm "The National Socialist Movement"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130104004433/http://www.adl.org/Learn/Ext_US/nsm/default.asp?LEARN_Cat=Extremism&amp;LEARN_SubCat=Extremism_in_America&amp;xpicked=3&amp;item=nsm |date=4 January 2013 }}. [[The Anti-Defamation League]].&lt;/ref&gt;  After World War II, new organizations formed with varying degrees of support for Nazi principles. The [[National States' Rights Party]], founded in 1958 by Edward Reed Fields and [[J. B. Stoner]] countered [[racial integration]] in the [[Southern United States]] with Nazi-inspired publications and iconography. The [[American Nazi Party]], founded by [[George Lincoln Rockwell]] in 1959, achieved high-profile coverage in the press through its public demonstrations.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, Jeffrey, ''[[Encyclopedia of White Power]]: A Sourcebook on the Radical Racist Right'' (Rowman Altamira, 2000), pp. 1–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ideology of [[James H. Madole]], leader of the [[National Renaissance Party (United States)|National Renaissance Party]], was influenced by [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Blavatskian Theosophy]]. [[Helena Blavatsky]] developed a racial theory of [[evolution]], holding that the [[white race]] was the "fifth rootrace" called the [[Aryan Race]]. According to Blavatsky, Aryans had been preceded by Atlanteans who had perished in the flood that sunk the continent [[Atlantis]]. The three races that preceded the Atlanteans, in Blavatsky's view, were proto-humans; these were the [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemurians]], [[Hyperborea|Hyperboreans]] and the first Astral rootrace. It was on upon this foundation that Madole based his claims the Aryan Race has been worshiped as "White Gods" since time immemorial and proposed a governance structure based on the Hindu [[Laws of Manu]] and its hierarchical [[Caste system in India|caste system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |publisher=NYU Press |isbn=978-0-8147-3155-0 |last=Goodrick-Clarke |first=Nicholas |title=Black Sun: Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism, and the Politics of Identity |date=2003 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Black_Sun.html?id=xaiaM77s6N4C |pages=79–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]] guarantees [[freedom of speech]], which allows political organizations great latitude in expressing Nazi, racist, and anti-Semitic views. A First Amendment landmark case was ''[[National Socialist Party of America v. Village of Skokie]]'', in which neo-Nazis threatened to march in a predominantly Jewish suburb of Chicago. The march never took place in Skokie, but the court ruling allowed the neo-Nazis to stage a series of demonstrations in Chicago.

The [[Institute for Historical Review]], formed in 1978, is a [[Holocaust denial]] body associated with neo-Nazism.&lt;ref name=ADL&gt;[http://www.adl.org/learn/ext_us/historical_review.asp?LEARN_Cat=Extremism&amp;LEARN_SubCat=Extremism_in_America&amp;xpicked=3&amp;item=ihr "Extremism in America: Institute for Historical Review"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115233810/http://www.adl.org/Learn/ext_us/historical_review.asp?LEARN_Cat=Extremism&amp;LEARN_SubCat=Extremism_in_America&amp;xpicked=3&amp;item=ihr |date=15 January 2013 }}, [[Anti-Defamation League]]. Retrieved 28 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizations which report upon American neo-Nazi activities include the [[Anti-Defamation League]] and the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]]. American neo-Nazis are known to attack and harass minorities.&lt;ref&gt;''American Swastika: Inside the White Power Movement's Hidden Spaces of Hate'' By Pete Simi, Robert Futrell&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=October 2016}}

===Africa===
Several groups in [[South Africa]] such as [[Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging]] and [[Blanke Bevrydingsbeweging]], have often been described as neo-Nazi.&lt;ref name="afrikaner"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/africa/04/05/south.africa.terreblanche/|title=South Africa's neo-Nazis drop revenge vow |publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Eugène Terre'Blanche]] was a prominent South African neo-Nazi leader who was murdered in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/eugegravene-terreblanche-leader-of-the-far-right-awb-party-who-led-the-resistance-to-majority-rule-1936550.html|title=Eugène Terre'Blanche: Leader of the far-right AWB party who led|date=6 April 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oceania===

There were a number of now-defunct Australian neo-Nazi groups, such as the [[Australian National Socialist Party]] (ANSP), which was formed in 1962 and merged into the [[National Socialist Party of Australia]] (1968-1970s), originally a splinter group, in 1968,&lt;ref name="Henderson 76"&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=27516076|title=Frank Browne and the Neo-Nazis|last=Henderson|first=Peter|journal=Labour History|date=November 2005|number=89|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jack van Tongeren]]'s Australian Nationalist Movement.&lt;ref name="Henderson 76"/&gt; 

Current active organisations include [[Antipodean Resistance]], local chapters of the Aryan Nations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/national/crime/murder-shines-spotlight-on-australias-white-supremacist-subculture/news-story/0243f471b2174953d839946f85bab29b|title=Murder shines spotlight on Australia's ugly subculture|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Blood and Honour,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloodandhonouraustralia.org/|title=BH Australia|website=www.bloodandhonouraustralia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as prominent individuals such as [[Blair Cottrell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/blair-cottrell-leader-of-aussie-patriots-upf-wanted-hitler-in-the-classroom-20151016-gkbbvz.html|title=Blair Cottrell, rising anti-Islam movement leader, wanted Hitler in the classroom|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RGBL I 1935 S 1145.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Title page of the German [[government gazette]] ''Reichsgesetzblatt'' issue proclaiming the laws, published on 16 September 1935 (RGB I No. 100)]]

The '''Nuremberg Laws''' ({{lang-de|link=no|Nürnberger Gesetze}}) were [[antisemitic]] and [[Racism|racial]] laws in [[Nazi Germany]]. They were enacted by the [[Reichstag (Nazi Germany)|Reichstag]] on 15&amp;nbsp;September 1935, at a special meeting convened during the annual [[Nuremberg Rally]] of the [[Nazi Party]] (NSDAP). The two laws were the Law for the Protection of German Blood and German Honour, which forbade marriages and [[extramarital intercourse]] between [[Jews]] and Germans  and the employment of German females under 45 in Jewish households; and the Reich Citizenship Law, which declared that only those of German or related blood were eligible to be Reich citizens; the remainder were classed as state subjects, without citizenship rights. A supplementary decree outlining the definition of who was Jewish was passed on 14 November, and the Reich Citizenship Law officially came into force on that date. The laws were expanded on 26 November 1935 to include [[Romani people]]. This supplementary decree defined Romanis as "enemies of the race-based state", the same category as Jews.

Out of foreign policy concerns, prosecutions under the two laws did not commence until after the [[1936 Summer Olympics]], held in Berlin. After the Nazis [[Machtergreifung|seized power]] in 1933, they began to implement their policies, which included the formation of a ''[[Volksgemeinschaft]]'' (people's community) based on race. [[Chancellor of Germany#Chancellor of Nazi Germany (1933–1945)|Chancellor]] and [[Führer]] (leader) [[Adolf Hitler]] declared a [[Nazi boycott of Jewish businesses|national boycott of Jewish businesses]] on 1 April 1933, and the [[Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service]], passed on 7 April, excluded [[Aryan race#Nazism|non-Aryans]] from the legal profession and civil service. Books considered un-German, including those by Jewish authors, were destroyed in a nationwide [[Nazi book burnings|book burning]] on 10 May. Jewish citizens were harassed and subjected to violent attacks. They were actively suppressed, stripped of their citizenship and civil rights, and eventually completely removed from German society.

The Nuremberg Laws had a crippling economic and social impact on the Jewish community. Persons convicted of violating the marriage laws were imprisoned, and (subsequent to 8 March 1938) upon completing their sentences were re-arrested by the [[Gestapo]] and sent to [[Nazi concentration camps]]. Non-Jews gradually stopped socialising with Jews or shopping in Jewish-owned stores, many of which closed due to lack of customers. As Jews were no longer permitted to work in the civil service or government-regulated professions such as medicine and education, many middle class business owners and professionals were forced to take menial employment. Emigration was problematic, as Jews were required to remit up to 90 per cent of their wealth as a tax upon leaving the country. By 1938 it was almost impossible for potential Jewish emigrants to find a country willing to take them. Mass deportation schemes such as the [[Madagascar Plan]] proved to be impossible for the Nazis to carry out, and starting in mid-1941, the German government started mass exterminations of the Jews of Europe.

==Background==
{{Main|Nazi eugenics|Nazism and race}}
The [[National Socialist German Workers' Party]] (NSDAP; Nazi Party) was one of several [[Far-right politics|far-right]] political parties active in Germany after the end of the First World War.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=170–171}} The party platform included removal of the [[Weimar Republic]], rejection of the terms of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], radical antisemitism, and anti-[[Bolshevism]].{{sfn|Goldhagen|1996|p=85}} They promised a strong central government, increased ''[[Lebensraum]]'' (living space) for Germanic peoples, formation of a ''[[Volksgemeinschaft]]'' (people's community) based on race, and racial cleansing via the active suppression of Jews, who would be stripped of their citizenship and civil rights.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=179–180}}

While imprisoned in 1924 after the failed [[Beer Hall Putsch]], Hitler dictated ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' to his deputy, [[Rudolf Hess]].{{sfn|Bullock|1962|p=121}} The book is an autobiography and exposition of Hitler's ideology in which he laid out his plans for transforming German society into one based on race. In it he outlined his belief in [[Jewish Bolshevism]], a conspiracy theory that posited the existence of an international Jewish conspiracy for world domination in which the Jews were the mortal enemy of the German people. Throughout his life Hitler never wavered in his [[world view]] as expounded in ''Mein Kampf''.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=148–150}} The NSDAP advocated the concept of a ''[[Volksgemeinschaft]]'' ("people's community") with the aim of uniting all Germans as national comrades, whilst excluding those deemed either to be community aliens or of a [[foreign races|foreign race]] (''Fremdvölkische'').{{sfn|Wildt|2012|pp=96–97}}

==Nazi Germany==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-14469, Berlin, Boykott-Posten vor jüdischem Warenhaus.jpg|thumb|left|Members of the [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] picket in front of a Jewish place of business during the [[Nazi boycott of Jewish businesses]], 1 April 1933.]]
Discrimination against Jews intensified after the NSDAP seized power; following a month-long series of attacks by members of the ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA; paramilitary wing of the NSDAP) on Jewish businesses, synagogues, and members of the legal profession, on 1 April 1933 Hitler declared a [[Nazi boycott of Jewish businesses|national boycott of Jewish businesses]].{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=203}} By 1933, many people who were not NSDAP members advocated segregating Jews from the rest of German society.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=539}} The [[Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service]], passed on 7 April 1933, forced all non-Aryans to retire from the legal profession and civil service.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=40}} Similar legislation soon deprived Jewish members of other professions of their right to practise.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=40}} In 1934, the NSDAP published a pamphlet titled ''"Warum Arierparagraph?"'' ("Why the Aryan Law?"), which summarised the perceived need for the law.{{sfn|Schulz|Frercks|1934}} As part of the drive to remove Jewish influence from cultural life, members of the National Socialist Student League removed from libraries any books considered un-German, and a nationwide [[Nazi book burnings|book burning]] was held on 10 May.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=39}} Violence and economic pressure were used by the regime to encourage Jews to voluntarily leave the country.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=67–69}} Legislation passed in July 1933 stripped naturalised German Jews of their citizenship, creating a legal basis for recent immigrants (particularly Eastern European Jews) to be deported.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=40}} Many towns posted signs forbidding entry to Jews.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=233}} Throughout 1933 and 1934, Jewish businesses were denied access to markets, forbidden to advertise in newspapers, and deprived of access to government contracts. Citizens were harassed and subjected to violent attacks.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=41}}

Other laws promulgated in this period included the [[Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring]] (passed on 14 July 1933), which called for the compulsory sterilisation of people with a range of hereditary, physical, and mental illnesses.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=507}} Under the Law against Dangerous Habitual Criminals (passed 24 November 1935), habitual criminals were forced to undergo sterilisation as well.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=511}} This law was also used to force the incarceration in prison or [[Nazi concentration camps]] of "social misfits" such as the chronically unemployed, prostitutes, beggars, alcoholics, homeless vagrants, and [[Romani people|Romani]] (referred to as "Gypsies").{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=49}}

===Reich Gypsy Law===
The Central Office for Combatting Gypsies was established in 1929.{{sfn|Hilberg|2003|p=1070}} In December 1938 ''[[Reichsführer-SS]]'' [[Heinrich Himmler]] issued an order for "combatting the Gypsy plague". Romanis were to be categorised in terms of their Roma ancestry as a racial characteristic, rather than their previous association as 'anti-social' elements of society.{{sfn|McGarry|2010|p=21}} This work was advanced by Dr Robert Ritter of the Racial Hygiene and Population unit of the Ministry of Health, who by 1942, had produced a scale of ZM+, ZM of the first and second degree, and ZM- to reflect an individual's decreasing level of Romani ancestry.{{sfn|Hilberg|2003|pp=1070–1071}} This classification meant that one could be classified as Roma and subject to anti-Roma legislation on the basis of having two Roma great-great grandparents.{{sfn|Wolfe|2014|p=96}} Dr Zindel of the Ministry of the Interior prepared a draft of a Reich "Gypsy Law" intended to supplement and accompany the Nuremberg Laws. According to Zindel, the "Gypsy problem" could not be dealt with by forced resettlement or imprisonment within Germany. He recommended identification and registration of all Roma, followed by sterilisation and deportation. In 1938, public health authorities were ordered to register all Roma and Roma ''Mischlinge''.{{sfn|Grenville|2002|p=320}} Despite Himmler's interest in enacting such legislation, which he said would prevent "further intermingling of blood, and which regulates all the most pressing questions which go together with the existences of Gypsies in the living space of the German nation",{{sfn|Burleigh|Wippermann|1991|p=121}} the regime never promulgated the "Gypsy Law".{{sfn|USHMM, "Sinti and Roma"}} In December 1942, Himmler ordered that all Roma were to be sent to Nazi concentration camps.{{sfn|McGarry|2010|p=21}}

==="The Jewish problem"===
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-P049500, Berlin, Aufmarsch der SA in Spandau.jpg|thumb|The SA had nearly three million members at the start of 1934.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=22}}]]
Disenchanted with the unfulfilled promise of the NSDAP to eliminate Jews from German society, SA members were eager to lash out against the Jewish minority as a way of expressing their frustrations. A [[Gestapo]] report from early 1935 stated that the rank and file of the NSDAP would set in motion a solution to the "[[Jewish problem]]&amp;nbsp;... from below that the government would then have to follow".{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=340}} Assaults, vandalism, and [[boycotts]] against Jews, which the Nazi government had temporarily curbed in 1934, increased again in 1935 amidst a propaganda campaign authorised at the highest levels of government.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=340}} Most non-party members ignored the boycotts and objected to the violence out of concern for their own safety.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=341}} The Israeli historian [[Otto Dov Kulka]] argues that there was a disparity between the views of the ''[[Alte Kämpfer]]'' (longtime party members) and the general public, but that even those Germans who were not politically active favoured bringing in tougher new antisemitic laws in 1935.{{sfn|Marrus|2000|pp=92–93}} The matter was raised to the forefront of the state agenda as a result of this antisemitic agitation.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=342}}

The Interior Minister [[Wilhelm Frick]] announced on 25 July that a law forbidding marriages between Jews and non-Jews would shortly be promulgated, and recommended that registrars should avoid issuing licenses for such marriages for the time being. The draft law also called for a ban on marriage for persons with hereditary illnesses.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=57–58}}

Dr. [[Hjalmar Schacht]], the Economics Minister and [[Reichsbank]] president, criticised the violent behaviour of the ''Alte Kämpfer'' and SA because of its negative impact on the economy.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=342}} The violence also had a negative impact on Germany's reputation in the international community.{{sfn|Gordon|1984|p=122}} For these reasons, Hitler ordered a stop to "individual actions" against German Jews on 8 August 1935, and the Interior Minister Wilhelm Frick threatened to take legal action against Party members who ignored the order.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=342}} From Hitler's perspective, it was imperative to quickly bring in new antisemitic laws to appease the radical elements in the NSDAP who persisted in attempting to remove the Jews from German society by violent means.{{sfn|Gordon|1984|p=122}} A conference of ministers was held on 20 August 1935 to discuss the question. Hitler argued against violent methods because of the damage being done to the economy, and insisted the matter must be settled through legislation.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=343}} The focus of the new laws would be marriage laws to prevent "racial defilement", stripping Jews of their German citizenship, and laws to prevent Jews from participating freely in the economy.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=59}}

===Events at Nuremberg===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-2004-0312-505, Nürnberg, Reichsparteitag, Grundstein Kongreßhalle.jpg|NSDAP dignitaries at the 1935 [[Nuremberg Rally]]|thumb|left]]

The seventh annual [[Nuremberg Rally|Nazi Party Rally]], held in Nuremberg from 10–16 September 1935, featured the only [[Reichstag (Nazi Germany)|Reichstag]] session held outside Berlin during the Nazi regime.{{sfn|Friedländer|2009|p=45}} Hitler decided that the rally would be a good opportunity to introduce the long-awaited anti-Jewish laws.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=543}} In a speech on 12 September, leading Nazi physician [[Gerhard Wagner (Nazi physician)|Gerhard Wagner]] announced that the government would soon introduce a "law for the protection of German blood".{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=344}} The next day, Hitler summoned the Reichstag to meet in session at Nuremberg on 15 September, the last day of the rally.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=543}} Franz Albrecht Medicus and [[Bernhard Lösener]] of the Interior Ministry were summoned to Nuremberg and directed to start preparing a draft of a law forbidding sexual relations or marriages between Jews and non-Jews. The two men arrived on 14 September.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=344–345}} That evening, Hitler ordered them to also have ready by morning a draft of the Reich citizenship law.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=59}} Hitler found the initial drafts of the Blood Law to be too lenient, so at around midnight Frick brought him four new drafts that differed mainly in the severity of the penalties they imposed. Hitler chose the most lenient version, but left vague the definition of who was a Jew.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=345–346}} Hitler stated at the rally that the laws were "an attempt at the legal settlement of a problem, which, if this proved a failure, would have to be entrusted by law to the National Socialist Party for a definitive solution".{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=60}} Propaganda Minister [[Joseph Goebbels]] had the radio broadcast of the passing of the laws cut short, and ordered the German media to not mention them until a decision was made as to how they would be implemented.{{sfn|Mommsen|1989|p=225}}

The two Nuremberg Laws were unanimously passed by the Reichstag on 15 September 1935.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=544}} The Law for the Protection of German Blood and German Honour prohibited marriages and [[extramarital intercourse]] between Jews and Germans, and forbade the employment of German females under 45 in Jewish households. The Reich Citizenship Law declared that only those of German or related blood were eligible to be Reich citizens; the remainder were classed as state subjects, without citizenship rights.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=345}} The wording in the Citizenship Law that a person must prove "by his conduct that he is willing and fit to faithfully serve the German people and Reich" meant that political opponents could also be stripped of their German citizenship.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=544}} This law was effectively a means of stripping Jews, Roma, and other "undesirables" of their legal rights, and their citizenship.{{sfn|Wolfe|2014|p=94}}

Over the coming years, an additional 13 supplementary laws were promulgated that further marginalised the Jewish community in Germany.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=233}} For example, Jewish families were not permitted to submit claims for subsidies for large families and were forbidden to transact business with Aryans.{{sfn|Burleigh|Wippermann|1991|p=84}}

===Law for the Protection of German Blood and German Honour===
Moved by the understanding that purity of German blood is the essential condition for the continued existence of the German people, and inspired by the inflexible determination to ensure the existence of the German nation for all time, the Reichstag has unanimously adopted the following law, which is promulgated herewith:

;Article 1
# Marriages between Jews and citizens of German or related blood are forbidden. Marriages nevertheless concluded are invalid, even if concluded abroad to circumvent this law.

;Article 2
Extramarital relations between Jews and citizens of German or related blood are forbidden.{{sfn|US Holocaust Memorial Museum}}
;Article 3

;Article 6
The Reich Minister of the Interior, in co-ordination with the Deputy of the Führer and the Reich Minister of Justice, will issue the legal and administrative regulations required to implement and complete this law.{{sfn|US Holocaust Memorial Museum}}
;Article 7
The law takes effect on the day following promulgation, except for Article 3, which goes into force on 1 January 1936.{{sfn|US Holocaust Memorial Museum}}

===Reich Citizenship Law===

The Reichstag has unanimously enacted the following law, which is promulgated herewith:

;Article 1
# A subject of the state is a person who enjoys the protection of the German Reich and who in consequence has specific obligations toward it.
# The status of subject of the state is acquired in accordance with the provisions of the Reich and the Reich Citizenship Law.{{sfn|US Holocaust Memorial Museum}}
;Article 2
# A Reich citizen is a subject of the state who is of German or related blood, and proves by his conduct that he is willing and fit to faithfully serve the German people and Reich.
# Reich citizenship is acquired through the granting of a Reich citizenship certificate.
# The Reich citizen is the sole bearer of full political rights in accordance with the law.{{sfn|US Holocaust Memorial Museum}}
;Article 3
The Reich Minister of the Interior, in co-ordination with the Deputy of the Führer, will issue the legal and administrative orders required to implement and complete this law.{{sfn|US Holocaust Memorial Museum}}

While both the Interior Ministry and the NSDAP agreed that persons with three or more Jewish grandparents would be classed as being Jewish and those with only one (''[[Mischling]]e'' of the second degree) would not, a debate arose as to the status of persons with two Jewish grandparents (''Mischlinge'' of the first degree).{{sfn|Friedländer|2009|p=49}} The NSDAP, especially its more radical elements, wanted the laws to apply to ''Mischlinge'' of both the first and second degree.{{sfn|Mommsen|1989|p=224}} For this reason Hitler continued to stall, and did not make a decision until early November 1935. His final ruling was that persons with three Jewish grandparents were classed as Jewish; those with two Jewish grandparents would be considered Jewish only if they practised the faith or had a Jewish spouse.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=347}} The supplementary decree outlining the definition of who was Jewish was passed on 14 November, and the Reich Citizenship Law came into force on that date. Jews were no longer German citizens and did not have the right to vote.{{sfn|Friedländer|2009|p=50}} Jews and Gypsies were not allowed to vote in Reichstag elections or the [[Anschluss]].{{sfn|Milton|2001|p=216}} Civil servants who had been granted an exemption to the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service because of their status as war veterans were forced out of their jobs on this date.{{sfn|Friedländer|2009|p=50}} A supplementary decree issued on 21 December ordered the dismissal of Jewish veterans from other state-regulated professions such as medicine and education.{{sfn|Friedländer|2009|p=50}}

While Frick's suggestion that a citizenship tribunal before which every German would have to prove that they were Aryan was not acted upon, proving one's racial heritage became a necessary part of daily life.{{sfn|Mommsen|1989|p=224}}{{sfn|Friedländer|2009|p=52}} Non-government employers were authorised to include in their statutes an [[Aryan paragraph]] excluding both ''Mischlinge'' and Jews from employment.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=547}} Proof of Aryan descent was achieved by obtaining an [[Aryan certificate]]. One form was to acquire an ''[[Ahnenpass]]'', which could be obtained by providing birth or baptismal certificates that all four grandparents were of Aryan descent.{{sfn|Ehrenreich|2007|p=68}} The ''Ahnenpass'' could also be acquired by citizens of other countries, as long as they were of "German or related blood".{{sfn|Scheil|2012}}

Under the ''Law for the Protection of German Blood and German Honour'' (15 September 1935), marriages were forbidden between Jews and Germans; between ''Mischlinge'' of the first degree and Germans; between Jews and ''Mischlinge'' of the second degree; and between two ''Mischlinge'' of the second degree. ''Mischlinge'' of the first degree were permitted to marry Jews, but they would henceforth be classed as Jewish themselves. All marriages undertaken between half-Jews and Germans required the approval of a Committee for the Protection of German Blood. Few such permissions were granted.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=547}} A supplementary decree issued on 26 November 1935 extended the law to "Gypsies, Negroes, and their bastards".{{sfn|Friedländer|2009|p=51}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R99993, Jude mit Stern in Berlin.jpg|thumb|upright|Beginning in 1941, Jews were required by law to self-identify by wearing a [[yellow badge]] on their clothing.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=217}}]]

Persons suspected of having sexual relations with non-Aryans were charged with ''[[Rassenschande]]'' (racial defilement) and tried in the regular courts. Evidence provided to the Gestapo for such cases was largely provided by ordinary citizens such as neighbours, co-workers, or other informants.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=551}} Persons accused of race defilement were publicly humiliated by being paraded through the streets with a placard around their necks detailing their crime.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=540}} Those convicted were typically sentenced to prison terms, and (subsequent to 8 March 1938) upon completing their sentences were re-arrested by the Gestapo and sent to [[Nazi concentration camps]].{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=551}} As the law did not permit capital punishment for racial defilement, special courts were convened to allow the death penalty for some cases.{{sfn|Majer|2003|pp=331–332}} From the end of 1935 through 1940, 1,911 people were convicted of ''Rassenschande''. Over time, the law was extended to include non-sexual forms of physical contact such as greeting someone with a kiss or an embrace.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=551}}

For the most part, Germans accepted the Nuremberg Laws, partly because Nazi propaganda had successfully swayed public opinion towards the general belief that Jews were a separate race, but also because to oppose the regime meant leaving oneself open to harassment or arrest by the Gestapo.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=548}}{{sfn|Gordon|1984|p=180}} Citizens were relieved that the antisemitic violence ceased after the laws were passed.{{sfn|Gordon|1984|p=172}} Non-Jews gradually stopped socialising with Jews or shopping in Jewish-owned stores.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=548, 553}} Wholesalers who continued to serve Jewish merchants were marched through the streets with placards around their necks proclaiming them as traitors.{{sfn|Gellately|1991|p=105}} The Communist party and some elements of the Catholic Church were critical of the laws.{{sfn|Friedländer|2009|p=51}} Concerned that international opinion would be adversely swayed by the new laws, the Interior Ministry did not actively enforce them until after the [[1936 Summer Olympics]], held in Berlin that August.{{sfn|Gordon|1984|p=122}}{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=548}}

The Interior Ministry estimated there were 750,000 ''Mischlinge'' as of April 1935 (studies done after the war put the number of ''Mischlinge'' at around 200,000).{{sfn|Friedländer|2009|p=51}} As Jews became more and more excluded from German society, they organised social events, schools, and activities of their own.{{sfn|Friedländer|2009|p=55}} Economic problems were not so easily solved, however; many Jewish firms went out of business due to lack of customers. This was part of the ongoing [[Aryanization (Nazism)|Aryanization]] process (the transfer of Jewish firms to non-Jewish owners, usually at prices far below market value) that the regime had initiated in 1933, which intensified after the Nuremberg Laws were passed.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=65–66}} Former middle-class or wealthy business owners were forced to take employment in menial jobs to support their families, and many were unable to find work at all.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=86}}

Although a stated goal of the Nazis was that all Jews should leave the country, emigration was problematic, as Jews were required to remit up to 90 per cent of their wealth as a tax upon leaving the country.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=64, 66}} Anyone caught transferring their money overseas were sentenced to lengthy terms in prison as "economic saboteurs".{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=66}} An exception was money sent to Palestine under the terms of the [[Haavara Agreement]], whereby Jews could transfer some of their assets and emigrate to that country. Around 52,000 Jews emigrated to Palestine under the terms of this agreement between 1933 and 1939.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=556–557}}

By the start of the Second World War in 1939, around 250,000 of Germany's 437,000 Jews had emigrated to the United States, Palestine, Great Britain, and other countries.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=127}}{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=555}} By 1938 it was becoming almost impossible for potential Jewish emigrants to find a country that would take them.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=67}} After the [[1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine|1936–39 Arab revolt]], the British were disinclined to accept any more Jews into Palestine for fear it would further destabilise the region.{{sfn|Friedländer|2009|p=57}} Nationalistic and [[xenophobic]] people in other countries pressured their governments not to accept waves of Jewish immigrants, especially poverty-stricken ones.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=560, 601}} The [[Madagascar Plan]], a proposed mass deportation of European Jews to Madagascar, proved to be impossible to carry out.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|pp=162–164}} Starting in mid-1941, the German government started mass exterminations of the Jews of Europe.{{sfn|Rhodes|2003|pp=159–160}} The total number of Jews murdered during the resulting [[Holocaust]] is estimated at 5.5 to 6 million people.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=318}} Estimates of the death toll of Romanis in the [[Porajmos]] range from 150,000 to 1,500,000.{{sfn|Hancock|2012|p=381}}

==Legislation in other countries==
[[File:The law for protection of the nation (Bulgaria).jpg|thumb|upright|Decree of Tsar [[Boris III of Bulgaria]] for approval of The law for protection of the nation]]
Some of the other [[Axis powers]] passed their own versions of the Nuremberg Laws.
*In 1938, Fascist Italy passed the [[Italian Racial Laws]] and [[Manifesto of Race]] which stripped Jews of their citizenship and forbade sexual relations and marriages between Jewish and non-Jewish Italians.{{sfn|Rodogno|2006|p=65}}
*Hungary passed laws on 28 May 1938 and 5 May 1939 banning Jews from various professions. A third law, added in August 1941, defined Jews as anyone with at least two Jewish grandparents, and forbade sexual relations or marriages between Jews and non-Jews.{{sfn|Frojimovics|2012|pp=250–251}}
*In 1940 the ruling [[Iron Guard]] in Romania passed the Law Defining the Legal Status of Romanian Jews,{{sfn|Fischer|2012|p=279}}
*In 1941 the Codex Judaicus was enacted in Slovakia,{{sfn|Matić|2002|p=174}}
*In 1941 Bulgaria passed the [[Law for Protection of the Nation]],{{sfn|Dikovski|2000}}
*In 1941 the [[Ustashe]] in Croatia passed legislation defining who was a Jew and restricting contact with them.{{sfn|Cohen|1999|p=90}}
*The [[Empire of Japan]] did not draft or pass any such legislation.

==Existing copies==
An original typescript of the laws signed by Hitler was found by the US Army's [[Counterintelligence Corps]] in 1945. It ended up in the possession of General [[George S. Patton]], who kept it, in violation of orders that such finds should be turned over to the government. During a visit to Los Angeles in 1945, he handed it over to the [[Huntington Library]], where it was stored in a bomb-proof vault. The library revealed the existence of the document in 1999, and sent it on permanent loan to the [[Skirball Cultural Center]], which placed it on public display. The document was transferred to the [[National Archives and Records Administration]] in Washington in August 2010.{{sfn|Allen|2010}}{{sfn|Bradsher|2010}}

{{Libertarianism sidebar |Aspects}}

[[Ayn Rand]]'s philosophy of [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]] has been and continues to be a major influence on the [[libertarianism|libertarian]] movement, particularly in the United States. Many libertarians justify their political views using aspects of Objectivism.&lt;ref&gt;Rand, Ayn, ''For the New Intellectual'' (1961) Random House; see also, Peikoff, Leonard, ''Objectivisim: the Philosophy of Ayn Rand'' (1991) Dutton.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the views of Rand and her philosophy among prominent libertarians are mixed and many Objectivists are hostile to libertarians in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schwartz |first=Peter |title=On Moral Sanctions |journal=The Intellectual Activist |volume=5 |issue=1 |date=May 18, 1989 |url=http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=objectivism_sanctions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophical disagreements ==

===Aggression===
Some libertarians, including [[Murray Rothbard]] and [[Walter Block]], hold the view that the [[non-aggression principle]] is an irreducible concept: it is not the logical result of any given ethical philosophy but, rather, is self-evident as any other axiom is.  Rand, too, argued that liberty was a precondition of virtuous conduct,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rand |first=Ayn |title=From My 'Future File' |journal=The Ayn Rand Letter |volume=3 |issue=26 |date=September 23, 1974 |pages=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; but argued that her non-aggression principle itself derived from a complex set of previous knowledge and values.  For this reason, Objectivists refer to the non-aggression principle as such, while libertarians who agree with Rothbard's argument call it "the non-aggression [[axiom]]."

Rothbard and other [[anarcho-capitalists]] hold that government requires non-voluntary taxation to function and that in all known historical cases, the state was established by force rather than [[social contract]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://mises.org/easaran/chap3.asp |last=Rothbard |first=Murray N. |title=Anatomy of the State: What the State Is Not |work=Egalitarianism as a Revolt Against Nature and Other Essays |year=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; They thus consider the establishment and maintenance of the [[night-watchman state]] supported by Objectivists to be in violation of the non-aggression principle. On the other hand, Rand believed that government can in principle be funded through voluntary means.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/taxation.html|title=Taxation|author=|date=|website=Ayn Rand Lexicon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Voluntary financing notwithstanding, libertarians consider that a government would by definition still violate individual rights (commit aggression) by enforcing a monopoly over a given territory[https://www.lewrockwell.com/1970/01/roy-a-childs-jr/objectivism-and-the-state-an-open-letter-to-ayn-rand/]. Objectivists do not specify what would be the legitimate expanse of the state's territory, nor what would be the proper way of reaching political decisions without violating the rights of disagreeing minorities[http://en.liberpedia.org/Proper_government].

===Objectivism's rejection of the "primitive"===
Jennifer Burns in her biography ''[[Goddess of the Market: Ayn Rand and the American Right]]'', notes how Rand's position that "Native Americans were savages", and that as a result "European colonists had a right to seize their land because native tribes did not recognize individual rights", was one of the views that "particularly outraged libertarians."&lt;ref name = "Burnspg266"&gt;{{cite book |title=Goddess of the Market: Ayn Rand and the American Right |last=Burns |first=Jennifer |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-19-532487-7 |oclc=313665028 |p=266}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burns also notes how Rand's position that "Palestinians had no rights and that it was moral to support Israel, the sole outpost of civilization in a region ruled by barbarism", was also a controversial position amongst libertarians, who at the time were a large portion of Rand's fan base.&lt;ref name = "Burnspg266" /&gt;

===Foreign policy===
Libertarians and Objectivists often disagree about matters of foreign policy. Rand's rejection of what she deemed to be "primitivism" extended to the [[Middle East peace process]] in the 1970s.&lt;ref name = "Burnspg266" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RandArabs"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aynrand.org/404|title=404|author=|date=|website=aynrand.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Arab-Israeli War of 1973]], Rand denounced [[Arabs]] as "primitive" and "one of the least developed cultures" who "are typically nomads."&lt;ref name = "RandArabs" /&gt; Consequently, Rand contended Arab resentment for Israel was a result of the Jewish state being "the sole beachhead of modern science and civilization on their (Arabs) continent", while decreeing that "when you have civilized men fighting savages, you support the civilized men, no matter who they are."&lt;ref name = "RandArabs" /&gt;

Most scholars of the libertarian [[Cato Institute]] have opposed military intervention against Iran,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/bottom-line-iran-costs-benefits-preventive-war-versus-deterrence|title=The Bottom Line on Iran: The Costs and Benefits of Preventive War versus Deterrence|first1=Justin Logan December|last1=4|first2=|last2=2006|date=4 December 2006|website=Cato Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the Objectivist [[Ayn Rand Institute]] has supported forceful intervention in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [http://www.aynrand.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&amp;id=5207&amp;news_iv_ctrl=1021 Peikoff, Leonard, "End States That Sponsor Terrorism,"] October 2, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aynrand.org/site/News2?id=5336&amp;news_iv_ctrl=1221&amp;page=NewsArticle "Iran and the 'Axis of Evil,'"] ''The Ayn Rand Center for Individual Rights'',  Feb 4, 2002 (retrieved 4-16-09);&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rand's influence on libertarianism ==

The United States [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]]'s first candidate for [[President of the United States]], [[John Hospers]], credited Rand as a major force in shaping his own political beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Hospers, John, ''Libertarianism'', Nash, 1971; "Conversations with Ayn Rand," ''Liberty'', July 1990, pp. 23-36, and Sept. 1990, pp. 42-52; and, "Memories of Ayn Rand," ''Full Context'', May, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Boaz]], executive vice president of the [[Cato Institute]], an American libertarian [[think tank]], described Rand's work as "squarely within the libertarian tradition" and that some libertarians are put off by "the starkness of her presentation and by her cult following."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Boaz |first=David |title=Ayn Rand at 100 |date=February 2, 2005 |url=http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=3661 |accessdate=2009-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Milton Friedman]] described Rand as "an utterly intolerant and dogmatic person who did a great deal of good."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Best of Both Worlds |last=Doherty |first=Brian |authorlink=Brian Doherty (journalist) |journal=Reason |date=June 1995 |url=http://www.reason.com/news/show/29691.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; One Rand biographer quoted [[Murray Rothbard]] as saying that he was "in agreement basically with all [Rand's] philosophy," and saying that it was Rand who had "convinced him of the theory of [[natural rights]]..."&lt;ref&gt;Branden, Barbara, ''The Passion of Ayn Rand'', Doubleday, 1984, p. 413; according to his biographer, [[Justin Raimondo]], Rothbard wrote a letter to Rand declaring, "''Atlas Shrugged'' is the greatest novel ever written," Raimondo, Justin, ''An Enemy of the State: The Life of Murray N. Rothbard'', Prometheus Books, 2000, p. 118, cf. Rothbard, Murray, "Letters: the Philosophy of Ayn Rand," ''The National Review'', January 18, 1958, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;  Rothbard would later become a particularly harsh critic of Rand, writing in ''The Sociology of the Ayn Rand Cult'' that:

{{quote|The major lesson of the history of the &lt;nowiki&gt;[objectivist]&lt;/nowiki&gt; movement to libertarians is that It Can Happen Here, that libertarians, despite explicit devotion to reason and individuality, are not exempt from the mystical and totalitarian cultism that pervades other ideological as well as religious movements. Hopefully, libertarians, once bitten by the virus, may now prove immune.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Murray |last=Rothbard |authorlink=Murray Rothbard |title=The Sociology of the Ayn Rand Cult |year=1972 |url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard23.html |accessdate=2009-08-04}} Rothbard's essay was later revised and printed as a pamphlet by ''[[Liberty (1987)|Liberty]]'' magazine in 1987, and by the Center for Libertarian Studies in 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some Objectivists have argued that Objectivism is not limited to Rand's own positions on philosophical issues and are willing to work with and identify with the libertarian movement. This stance is most clearly identified with [[David Kelley]] (who separated from the Ayn Rand Institute because of disagreements over the relationship between Objectivists and libertarians), [[Chris Sciabarra]], [[Barbara Branden]] (Nathaniel Branden's former wife), and others. Kelley's [[The Atlas Society|Atlas Society]] has focused on building a closer relationship between "open Objectivists" and the libertarian movement[https://www.sflacademy.org/introduction-to-objectivism/].

== Rand's view of libertarians ==

Rand condemned libertarianism as being a greater threat to freedom and capitalism than both modern liberalism and conservatism.&lt;ref name="Q&amp;A"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=education_campus_libertarians|title=FAQ|author=|date=|website=www.aynrand.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rand regarded Objectivism as an integrated philosophical system. Libertarianism, in contrast, is a political philosophy which confines its attention to matters of public policy. For example, Objectivism argues positions in [[metaphysics]], [[epistemology]], and [[ethics]], whereas libertarianism does not address such questions. Rand believed that political advocacy could not succeed without addressing what she saw as its methodological prerequisites. Rand rejected any affiliation with the libertarian movement and many other Objectivists have done so as well.&lt;ref name="Schwartz, Peter 1988 pp. 311–333"&gt;Schwartz, Peter, "Libertarianism: the Perversion of Liberty," in ''[[The Voice of Reason (book)|The Voice of Reason]]'', L. Peikoff, editor (1988) New American Library, pp. 311–333.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rand said of libertarians that:
{{quote|They're not defenders of capitalism. They're a group of publicity seekers.... Most of them are my enemies... I've read nothing by Libertarians (when I read them, in the early years) that wasn't my ideas badly mishandled—i.e., the teeth pulled out of them—with no credit given."&lt;ref name="Q&amp;A"/&gt;}}

In a 1981 interview, Rand described libertarians as "a monstrous, disgusting bunch of people" who "plagiarize my ideas when that fits their purpose."&lt;ref name="Q&amp;A"/&gt;

Responding to a question about the Libertarian Party in 1976, Rand said:
{{quote|The trouble with the world today is philosophical: only the right philosophy can save us. But this party plagiarizes some of my ideas, mixes them with the exact opposite—with religionists, anarchists and every intellectual misfit and scum they can find—and call themselves libertarians and run for office."&lt;ref name="answers73"&gt;{{cite book |last=Rand |first=Ayn |editor-last=Mayhew |editor-first=Robert |year=2005 |title=Ayn Rand Answers, the Best of Her Q&amp;A |isbn=0-451-21665-2 |publisher=New American Library |location=New York |page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Ayn Rand Institute board member [[John A. Allison IV|John Allison]] spoke at the Cato Club 200 Retreat in September 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Cato Institute |title=Self Ownership and the Financial Crisis |url=http://www.cato.org/multimedia/daily-podcast/self-ownership-financial-crisis |accessdate=2012-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; contributed "The Real Causes of the Financial Crisis" to ''Cato's Letter'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Cato Institute |url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/catosletter/catosletterv10n1.pdf |accessdate=2012-09-19 |title=The Real Causes of the Financial Crisis}}&lt;/ref&gt; and spoke at Cato's Monetary Conference in November, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cato.org/multimedia/daily-podcast/fedas-destruction-wealth |publisher=Cato Institute |title=The Fed's Destruction of Wealth |accessdate=2012-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 25, 2012, the [[Cato Institute]] announced that [[John A. Allison IV|John Allison]] would become its next president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cato.org/pressroom.php?display=news&amp;id=209 |title=Cato Institute and Shareholders Reach Agreement in Principle |date=2012-06-25 |accessdate=2012-09-19 |publisher=Cato Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Cato's public announcement, Allison was described as a "revered libertarian." In communication to Cato employees, he wrote, "I believe almost all the name calling between libertarians and objectivists is irrational. I have come to appreciate that all objectivists are libertarians, but not all libertarians are objectivists."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Slate |title=Cato Shrugged: Panic About An Incoming Leader's Admiration for Ayn Rand |first=David |last=Weigel |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2012/08/30/cato_shrugged_panic_about_an_incoming_leader_s_admiration_for_ayn_rand.html |date=2012-08-12 |accessdate=2012-09-19}} Allison leaves "objectivists" uncapitalized.&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 15, 2012, Brook explained the changes to ''[[The American Conservative]]'':

{{quote|I don’t think there’s been a significant change in terms of our attitude towards libertarians. Two things have happened. We’ve grown, and we’ve gotten to a size where we don’t just do educational programs, we do a lot more outreach and a lot more policy and working with other organizations. I also believe the libertarian movement has changed. It’s become less influenced by Rothbard, less influenced by the anarchist, crazy for lack of a better word, wing of libertarianism. As a consequence, because we’re bigger and doing more things and because libertarianism has become more reasonable, we are doing more work with them than we have in the past. But I don’t think ideologically anything of substance has changed at the Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theamericanconservative.com/yaron-brook-on-the-ayn-rand-institutes-newfound-ecumenism/ |date=2012-10-15 |accessdate=2012-10-17 |title=Yaron Brook on the Ayn Rand Institute’s Newfound Ecumenism |first=Jordan |last=Bloom |publisher=The American Conservative}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{otheruses}}{{Politics sidebar|expanded=Policy}} 
{{distinguish|Police}}
A '''policy''' is a [[Deliberation|deliberate]] [[system]] of [[principle]]s to guide decisions and achieve rational outcomes. A policy is a statement of intent, and is implemented as a procedure or protocol. Policies are generally adopted by a [[governance]] body within an organization. Policies can assist in both ''subjective'' and ''objective'' [[decision making]]. Policies to assist in subjective decision making usually assist senior management with decisions that must be based on the relative merits of a number of factors, and as a result are often hard to test objectively, e.g. [[work-life balance]] policy. In contrast policies to assist in objective decision making are usually operational in nature and can be objectively tested, e.g. password policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sydney.edu.au/legal/policy/what/index.shtml|title=What is policy|first=Publications|last=Office|date=|website=sydney.edu.au|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term may apply to government, private sector organizations and groups, as well as individuals. [[Executive order (United States)|Presidential executive orders]], [[privacy policy|corporate privacy policies]], and parliamentary [[rules of order]] are all examples of policy. Policy differs from [[rule of law|rules]] or [[law]]. While law can compel or prohibit behaviors (e.g. a law requiring the payment of taxes on income), policy merely guides actions toward those that are most likely to achieve a desired outcome.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Policy or [[policy study]] may also refer to the process of making important organizational decisions, including the identification of different alternatives such as programs or spending priorities, and choosing among them on the basis of the impact they will have. Policies can be understood as political, [[management|managerial]], financial, and administrative mechanisms arranged to reach explicit goals. In public corporate finance, a [[critical accounting policy]] is a policy for a firm/company or an industry that is considered to have a notably high subjective element, and that has a material impact on the [[financial statement]]s.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

==Impact==

===Intended effects===
The intended effects of a policy vary widely according to the organization and the context in which they are made. Broadly, policies are typically instituted to avoid some negative effect that has been noticed in the 
organization, or to seek some positive benefit. {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Corporate [[Purchasing process|purchasing policies]] provide an example of how organizations attempt to avoid negative  effects. Many large companies have policies that all purchases above a certain value must be performed through a purchasing process. By requiring this standard purchasing process through policy, the organization can limit waste and standardize the way purchasing is done. {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

The State of [[California]] provides an example of benefit-seeking policy. In recent years, the numbers of [[hybrid cars]] in California has increased dramatically, in part because of policy changes in [[Federal law]] that provided USD $1,500 in tax credits (since phased out) as well as the use of [[HOV|high-occupancy vehicle]] lanes to hybrid owners (no loew hybrid vehicles). In this case, the organization (state and/or federal government) created an effect (increased ownership and use of hybrid vehicles) through policy (tax breaks, highway lanes). {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

===Unintended effects===
Policies frequently have side effects or [[unintended consequences]].  Because the environments that policies seek to influence or manipulate are typically [[complex adaptive systems]] (e.g. governments, societies, large companies), making a policy change can have [[counterintuitive]] results.  For example, a government may make a policy decision to raise taxes, in hopes of increasing overall tax revenue.  Depending on the size of the tax increase, this may have the overall effect of reducing tax revenue by causing [[capital flight]] or by creating a rate so high that citizens are deterred from earning the money that is taxed. (See the [[Laffer curve]].) {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

The policy formulation process theoretically includes an attempt to assess as many areas of potential policy impact as possible, to lessen the chances that a given policy will have unexpected or unintended consequences. {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

==Policy cycle==
In [[political science]], the '''policy cycle''' is a tool used for the analyzing of the development of a policy item. It can also be referred to as a "stagist approach", "stages heuristic" or "stages approach". It is thus a rule of thumb rather than the actual reality of how policy is created, but has been influential in how [[political science|political scientists]] looked at policy in general.&lt;ref&gt;
Robert T. Nakamura, THE TEXTBOOK POLICY PROCESS AND IMPLEMENTATION RESEARCH:
Review of Policy Research Volume 7, Issue 1, pages 142–154, September 1987
http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1541-1338.1987.tb00034.x/abstract&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed as a theory from [[Harold Lasswell]]'s work.

One version by James E. Anderson, in his ''Public Policy-Making'' (1974) has the following stages:
# [[Political agenda|Agenda]] setting (Problem identification) - The recognition of certain subject as a problem demanding further government attention. 
# Policy Formulation - Involves exploring a variation of options or alternative courses of action available for addressing the problem. (appraisal, dialogue, formulation, and consolidation)
# Decision-making - Government decides on an ultimate course of action, whether to perpetuate the policy status quo or alter it. (Decision could be 'positive', 'negative', or 'no-action') 
# [[Implementation]] - The ultimate decision made earlier will be put into practice.
# [[Evaluation]] - Assesses the effectiveness of a public policy in terms of its perceived intentions and results. [[Actor (policy debate)|Policy actors]] attempt to determine whether the course of action is a success or failure by examining its impact and outcomes.

An eight step policy cycle is developed in detail in ''The Australian Policy Handbook'' by Peter Bridgman and [[Glyn Davis]]: (now with Catherine Althaus in its 4th and 5th editions)

# Issue identification
# [[Policy analysis]]
# [[Public consultation|Consultation]] (which permeates the entire process)
# Policy instrument development
# Building coordination and coalitions
# Program Design: [[Decision theory|Decision]] making
# Policy [[Implementation]]
# Policy [[Evaluation]]

The Althaus, Bridgman &amp; Davis model is [[heuristic]] and [[iterative]]. It is {{clarify|text=intentionally [[Norm (philosophy)|normative]]|date=February 2016}} and not meant to be {{clarify|text=[[Organizational diagnostics|diagnostic]]|date=February 2016}} or [[predictive]]. Policy cycles are typically characterized as adopting a classical approach, and tend to describe processes from the perspective of policy decision makers. Accordingly, some [[Postpositivism|postpositivist]] academics challenge cyclical models as unresponsive and unrealistic, preferring systemic and more complex models.&lt;ref&gt;Young, John and Enrique Mendizabal. [https://www.odi.org/publications/1127-become-policy-entrepreneur-roma Helping researchers become policy entrepreneurs], [[Overseas Development Institute]], London, September 2009. &lt;!--accessed 07 October 2009--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They consider a broader range of actors involved in the policy space that includes [[Voluntary sector|civil society organisations]], the [[Mass media|media]], [[intellectuals]], [[think tanks]] or policy [[research institutes]], corporations, [[Advocacy group|lobbyists]], etc.

==Content==
Policies are typically [[promulgation|promulgated]] through official written documents. Policy documents often come with the endorsement or signature of the executive powers within an organization to legitimize the policy and demonstrate that it is considered in force. Such documents often have standard formats that are particular to the organization issuing the policy.  While such formats differ in form, policy documents usually contain certain standard components including '''{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}''' :
* A '''purpose statement''', outlining why the organization is issuing the policy, and what its desired effect or outcome of the policy should be.
* An '''applicability and scope''' statement, describing who the policy affects and which actions are impacted by the policy. The applicability and scope may expressly exclude certain people, organizations, or actions from the policy requirements.  Applicability and scope is used to focus the policy on only the desired targets, and avoid unintended consequences where possible.
* An '''effective date''' which indicates when the policy comes into force.  [[Ex post facto law|Retroactive policies]] are rare, but can be found.
* A '''responsibilities''' section, indicating which parties and organizations are responsible for carrying out individual policy statements.  Many policies may require the establishment of some ongoing function or action.  For example, a purchasing policy might specify that a purchasing office be created to process purchase requests, and that this office would be responsible for ongoing actions.  Responsibilities often include identification of any relevant [[Regulation|oversight]] and/or [[governance]] structures.
* '''Policy statements''' indicating the specific regulations, requirements, or modifications to organizational behavior that the policy is creating.  Policy statements are extremely diverse depending on the organization and intent, and may take almost any form.

Some policies may contain additional sections, including:
* '''Background''', indicating any reasons, history, ethical background statements, and/or intent that led to the creation of the policy, which may be listed as '''motivating factors'''.  This information is often quite valuable when policies must be evaluated or used in ambiguous situations, just as the intent of a law can be useful to a court when deciding a case that involves that law.
* '''Definitions''', providing clear and unambiguous definitions for terms and concepts found in the policy document.

==Typologies==
The American political scientist [[Theodore J. Lowi]] proposed four types of policy, namely '''distributive''', '''redistributive''', '''regulatory''' and '''constituent''' in his article 'Four systems of Policy, Politics and Choice' and in 'American Business, Public Policy, Case Studies and Political Theory'.
Policy addresses the [[intent]] of the organization, whether government, business, professional, or voluntary. Policy is intended to affect the 'real' world, by guiding the decisions that are made. Whether they are formally written or not, most organizations have identified policies.&lt;ref&gt;https://perguntasaopo.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/lowi_1972_four-systems-of-policy-politics-and-choice.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Policies may be classified in many different ways. The following is a sample of several different types of policies broken down by their effect on members of the organization.{{Citation needed|date = May 2018}}

===Distributive policies===
[[Distributive tendency|Distributive policies]] extend goods and services to members of an organization, as well as distributing the costs of the goods/services amongst the members of the organization. Examples include government policies that impact spending for [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]], [[public education]], [[highways]], and public safety, or a professional organization's benefits plan.{{Citation needed|date = May 2018}}

===Regulatory policies===
Regulatory policies, or mandates, limit the discretion of individuals and agencies, or otherwise compel certain types of behavior. These policies are generally thought to be best applied when good behavior can be easily defined and bad behavior can be easily regulated and punished through fines or sanctions. An example of a fairly successful public regulatory policy is that of a highway speed limit.{{Citation needed|date = May 2018}}

===Constituent policies===
Constituent policies create executive power entities, or deal with laws. Constituent policies also deal with Fiscal Policy in some circumstances.{{Citation needed|reason=As well as the governing board creates laws
Noman Dhakkn|date=February 2010}}

===Redistributive policies===
Policies are dynamic; they are not just static lists of goals or laws. Policy blueprints have to be implemented, often with unexpected results. Social policies are what happens 'on the ground' when they are implemented, as well as what happens at the decision making or legislative stage.{{Citation needed|date = May 2018}}

When the term policy is used, it may also refer to:{{Citation needed|date = May 2018}}
* Official government policy (legislation or guidelines that govern how laws should be put into operation)
* Broad ideas and goals in political manifestos and pamphlets
* A company or organization's policy on a particular topic.  For example, the equal opportunity policy of a company shows that the company aims to treat all its staff equally.

The actions the organization actually takes may often vary significantly from stated policy. This difference is sometimes caused by [[Horse trading|political compromise]] over policy, while in other situations it is caused by lack of policy implementation and enforcement. Implementing policy may have unexpected results, stemming from a policy whose reach extends further than the problem it was originally crafted to address. Additionally, unpredictable results may arise from selective or idiosyncratic enforcement of policy.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

Types of [[policy analysis]] include: &lt;!-- explain them!--&gt;

* Causal (resp. non-causal)
* Deterministic (resp. stochastic, randomized and sometimes non-deterministic)
* Index
* Memoryless (''e.g.'', non-stationary)
* Opportunistic (resp. non-opportunistic)
* Stationary (resp. non-stationary)

These qualifiers can be combined, so one could, for example, have a stationary-memoryless-index policy.

==Other uses of the term==
* In [[enterprise architecture]] for systems design, [[policy appliances]] are technical control and logging mechanisms to enforce or reconcile policy (systems use) rules and to ensure accountability in [[information systems]].
* In [[insurance]], policies are contracts between insurer and insured used to [[Indemnity|indemnify]] (protect) against potential loss from specified perils. While these documents are referred to as policies, they are in actuality a form of [[contract]] - see [[insurance contract]].
* In [[gambling]], policy is a form of an unsanctioned lottery, where players purport to purchase ''[[insurance]]'' against a chosen number being picked by a legitimate [[lottery]]. Or can refer to an ordinary [[Numbers game]]
* In [[artificial intelligence]] planning &lt;!-- as in artificial intelligence? unclear--&gt; and ''reinforcement learning'', a policy prescribes a non-empty deliberation (sequence of actions) given a non-empty sequence of states.
* In [[debate (parliamentary procedure)|debate]], the term "policy" is slang for [[policy debate|policy or cross-examination]] debate.

'''Principled Distance''' is a new model of [[secularism]] given by [[Rajeev Bhargava]]. the separation of government institutions and persons [[Mandate (politics)|mandated]] to represent [[State (polity)|the state]] from [[Religious organization|religious institution]]s and [[Clergy|religious dignitaries]]. [[Rajeev Bhargava|He]] says that [[India]]n secularism did not erect a strict wall of separation, but proposed a 'principled distance' between religion and state.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.opendemocracy.net/rajeev-bhargava/states-religious-diversity-and-crisis-of-secularism-0&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, by balancing the claims of individuals and religious communities, it never intended a bludgeoning privatization of religion. In India, secularism means equal treatment of all religions. Religion in India continues to assert its political authority in matters of personal law.&lt;ref&gt;http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/events/rethinking-secularism-refining-the-concepts-of-public-religions-principled-distance-and-the-twin-tolerations?q=Jos%C3%A9%20Casanova&lt;/ref&gt; The western model of secularism is criticized in India for being an outdated concept as Rajeev argued that since Western model was developed when society was more homogeneous but since in the era of globalization, society is becoming more heterogeneous therefore a new concept, suitable for the present situation, is needed. He even argued that since Europe itself is no more homogeneous hence West should also follow the principled distance model which on one hand respects the diversity and at the same time empowers the state to interfere in case of any discrimination in the name of religion.&lt;ref name="Rajeev"&gt;

==Examples of Principled Distance==
{{Essay-like|section|date=November 2014}}
Article 29 &amp; 30 in [[Constitution of India]] seeks a principled distance between minorities as well as majority to protect, preserve and propagate their cultural, linguistic and religious identity through establishment of cultural and education institutions.&lt;ref&gt;http://ncm.nic.in/Constitutional_provisions.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://realitycheck.wordpress.com/2013/01/15/article30-series/&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Haj subsidy]] is a subsidy given to [[Islam in India|Indian Muslim]] [[Hajj]] pilgrims by the Government of India.  The program has its origins in British colonial era. In post-colonial era, the [[Jawaharlal Nehru|Nehru]] government expanded the program in 1959 with the Hajj Act.&lt;ref name=ha1959&gt;[http://indiankanoon.org/doc/102428/ The Haj Committee Act, 1959] Government of India&lt;/ref&gt; The subsidy and taxpayer funded arrangements initially applied to Muslim Indian pilgrims traveling for religious reasons to Saudi Arabia, Syria, Iraq, Iran and Jordan. Since 1973, pilgrims applying through the [[Haj Committee of India]] are offered a concessionary fare on [[Air India]].&lt;ref name=facts&gt;Press Information Bureau, [http://www.indianmuslims.info/book/export/html/14454 "Hajj operation in India 2006"], December 2006. Retrieved 26 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;. The subsidy was withdrawn on January 16, 2018 as per the orders of the Supreme Court of India. 

[[Central Wakf Council, India]]  is an [[India]]n [[statutory body]] established in 1964 by the [[Government of India]] under Wakf Act, 1954 (now a sub section the Wakf Act, 1995) for the purpose of advising it on matters pertaining to working of the State Wakf Boards and proper administration of the [[Wakf]]s in the country. Wakf is a permanent dedication of movable or immovable properties for  religious, pious or charitable purposes as recognized by [[Muslim Law]], given by [[philanthropist]]s. The grant is known as ''mushrut-ul-khidmat'', while a person making such dedication is known as ''Wakif''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tnwakfboard.org/introduction.htm Introduction] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728114523/http://www.tnwakfboard.org/introduction.htm |date=2011-07-28 }} Tamilnadu Wakf Board website.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Ariff|first=Mohamed|title=The Islamic voluntary sector in Southeast Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NP4ZL0TJ9s4C&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=waqf&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=YualTPGZEIiycOO5sfQH&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=waqf&amp;f=false|year=1991|publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies|isbn=981-3016-07-8|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gupta|first=K.R. |author2=Amita Gupta|title=Concise encyclopaedia of India, (Volume 1) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o84vxeFIeYUC&amp;pg=PA192&amp;dq=wakf+board&amp;cd=4#v=onepage&amp;q=wakf%20board&amp;f=false|year=2006|publisher=Atlantic Publishers|isbn=81-269-0637-5|page=191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On one hand there is [[All India Muslim Personal Law Board]] (AIMPLB), a non-government organisation constituted in 1973 to adopt suitable strategies for the protection and continued applicability of [[Muslim Personal Law]] in India, most importantly, the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act of 1937, providing for the application of the Islamic Law Code of [[Shariat]] to Muslims in India in personal affairs.&lt;ref name="home"&gt;[http://www.aimplboard.org/index.html AIMPLB Home Page]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vakilno1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vakilno1.com/bareacts/muslimperact/muslimpersonalact.htm|title=The Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937|author=vakilno1.com|date=|work=|publisher=vakilno1.com|accessdate=13 February 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205211800/http://www.vakilno1.com/bareacts/muslimperact/muslimpersonalact.htm|archivedate=5 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Board presents itself as the leading body of Muslim opinion in India.

But on the other hand, through judgement, Supreme Court of India allows Muslims to adapt child. The apex court said on Wednesday that the laws of land has to get primacy over personal law till the country achieves Uniform Civil Code as provided in Article 44 of the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Supreme-Court-gives-Muslims-right-to-adopt-a-child/articleshow/30662143.cms&lt;/ref&gt;

* The Medicaid drug [[Rebate (marketing)|rebate]] for brand name drugs, paid by drug manufacturers to the states, is increased to 23.1% (except for the rebate for clotting factors and drugs approved exclusively for pediatric use, which increases to 17.1%), and the rebate is extended to Medicaid managed care plans; the Medicaid rebate for non-innovator, multiple source drugs is increased to 13% of average manufacturer price.&lt;ref name='ksr_list1' /&gt;
* A non-profit [[Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute]] is established, independent from government, to undertake [[comparative effectiveness research]].&lt;ref name='ksr_list1' /&gt; This is charged with examining the "relative health outcomes, clinical effectiveness, and appropriateness" of different medical treatments by evaluating existing studies and conducting its own. Its 19-member board is to include patients, doctors, hospitals, drug makers, device manufacturers, insurers, payers, government officials and health experts. It will not have the power to mandate or even endorse coverage rules or reimbursement for any particular treatment. Medicare may take the Institute's research into account when deciding what procedures it will cover, so long as the new research is not the sole justification and the agency allows for public input.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/36135106/ns/health-health_care/ |title=True or false?

The regulations that implement this provision are in subpart I of 42 CFR part 412 (§412.150 through §412.154).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/AcuteInpatientPPS/Readmissions-Reduction-Program.html|title=Readmissions Reduction Program}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in October, an estimated total of 2,217 hospitals across the nation will be penalized; however, only 307 of these hospitals will receive this year's maximum penalty, i.e., 1 percent off their base Medicare reimbursements. The penalty will be deducted from reimbursements each time a hospital submits a claim starting Oct. 1. The maximum penalty will increase after this year, to 2 percent of regular payments starting in October 2013 and then to 3 percent the following year. As an example, if a hospital received the maximum penalty of 1 percent and it submitted a claim for $20,000 for a stay, Medicare would reimburse it $19,800. Together, these 2,217 hospitals will forfeit more than $280 million in Medicare funds over the next year, i.e., until October 2013, as Medicare and Medicaid begin a wide-ranging push to start paying health care providers based on the quality of care they provide. The $280 million in penalties comprises about 0.3 percent of the total amount hospitals are paid by Medicare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kaiserhealthnews.org/Stories/2012/August/13/medicare-hospitals-readmissions-penalties.aspx|title=Medicare To Penalize 2,217 Hospitals For Excess Readmissions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Temporary waivers during implementation, 2010-2011==
During the implementation of the law, there were interim regulations put in place for a specific type of employer-funded insurance, the so-called "mini-med" or limited-benefit plans, which are low-cost to employers who buy them for their employees, but cap coverage at a very low level. The waivers allowed employers to temporarily avoid the regulations ending annual and lifetime limits on coverage, and were put in place to encourage employers and insurers offering mini-med plans not to withdraw medical coverage before those regulations come into force, by which time small employers and individuals will be able to buy non-capped coverage through the exchanges. Employers were only granted a waiver if they could show that complying with the limit would mean a significant decrease in employees' benefits coverage or a significant increase in employees' premiums.&lt;ref name="ELYB" /&gt;

By January 26, 2011, HHS said it had granted a total of 733 waivers for 2011, covering 2.1&amp;nbsp;million people, or about 1% of the privately insured population.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://cciio.cms.gov/resources/files/approved_applications_for_waiver.html Annual Limits Policy: Protecting Consumers, Maintaining Options, and Building a Bridge to 2014]", HHS-CMS-CCIIO, see section "Applications for Waiver of the Annual Limits Requirements"&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2011, the Obama Administration announced that all applications for new waivers and renewals of existing ones had to be filed by September 22 of that year, and no new waivers would be approved after this date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/43445375/ns/politics/ |title=Obama administration to end health care waivers |agency=Associated Press |publisher=msnbc.com |date=June 17, 2011 |accessdate=April 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The limited-benefit plans were sometimes offered to low-paid and part-time workers, for example in fast food restaurants or purchased direct from an insurer. Most company-provided health insurance policies starting on or after September 23, 2010, and before September 23, 2011, may not set an annual coverage cap lower than $750,000,&lt;ref name="ELYB"&gt;[http://www.healthcare.gov/law/provisions/limits/limits.html The Affordable Care Act: Eliminating Limits on Your Benefits] HHS web site&lt;/ref&gt; a lower limit that is raised in stages until 2014, by which time no insurance caps are allowed at all. By 2014, no health insurance, whether sold in the individual or group market, will be allowed to place an annual cap on coverage.

Among those receiving waivers were employers, large insurers, such as [[Aetna]] and [[Cigna]], and union plans covering about one million employees. [[McDonald's]], one of the employers that received a waiver, has 30,000 hourly employees whose plans have annual caps of $10,000. The waivers are issued for one year and can be reapplied for.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/07/business/07insure.html | work=The New York Times | first=Reed | last=Abelson | title=U.S. Waivers After Threats of Lost Health Coverage | date=October 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.suntimes.com/business/2782232,Waivers-on-healthreform.article | work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] | title=30 Companies Get One-Year Waiver From Health Reform Rule | date=October 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to the adjustments as "a balancing act", [[Nancy-Ann DeParle]], director of the Office of Health Reform at the White House, said, "The president wants to have a smooth glide path to 2014."&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

==Delays==
On July 2, 2013, the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama Administration]] announced on the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department's]] website that it would delay the employer mandate for one year, under Proposed Regulations REG-138006-12 until 2015.&lt;ref name="pri" /&gt;&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost" /&gt;&lt;ref name=CohnDelay&gt;{{cite web|author=Jonathan Cohn |url=https://newrepublic.com/article/113745/obamacare-employer-mandate-delayed-not-what-doctor-ordered |title=Some Bad News About Obamacare That Isn't Bogus |publisher=The New Republic |date=July 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=treasurystatement&gt;{{cite web|last=Mazur|first=Mark|title=Continuing to Implement the ACA in a Careful, Thoughtful Manner|url=http://www.treasury.gov/connect/blog/Pages/Continuing-to-Implement-the-ACA-in-a-Careful-Thoughtful-Manner-.aspx|publisher=United States Department of the Treasury|accessdate=16 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the statement, the Administration said that they were delaying implementation in order to meet two goals: "First, it will allow us to consider ways to simplify the new reporting requirements consistent with the law. Second, it will provide time to adapt health coverage and reporting systems while employers are moving toward making health coverage affordable and accessible for their employees."&lt;ref name="treasurystatement"/&gt;

The announcement was met with strong criticism by some who claimed that the authority to delay the implementation of the law lay with Congress.&lt;ref name=housereleasestexts&gt;{{cite news|last=Kasperowicz|first=Pete|title=House releases texts of health insurance mandate delays|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/310711-house-releases-texts-of-health-insurance-mandate-delays|accessdate=16 July 2013|newspaper=The Hill|date=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cannonDelayIllegal&gt;{{cite web|last=Cannon|first=Michael F.|title=Yes, Delaying Obamacare's Employer Mandate Is Illegal|url=http://www.cato.org/blog/yes-delaying-obamacares-employer-mandate-illegal|publisher=Cato Institute|accessdate=16 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=obamasuspendsthelaw&gt;{{cite news|last=McConnell|first=Michael W.|title=Michael McConnell: Obama Suspends the Law|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323823004578591503509555268|accessdate=16 July 2013|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=July 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senate Minority Leader [[Mitch McConnell]] argued that President Obama's authorization to delay the provision exceeded the limits of his executive power.&lt;ref name="obamasuspendsthelaw"/&gt; House Republicans brought two bills to a vote to draw attention to the issue: The [[Authority for Mandate Delay Act (H.R. 2667; 113th Congress)|Authority for Mandate Delay Act]]; and the [[Fairness for American Families Act (H.R. 2668; 113th Congress)|Fairness for American Families Act]], which would apply the same delay to the individual mandate, arguing that the individual mandate should be treated the same way – an action which the Obama Administration opposes.&lt;ref name="housereleasestexts"/&gt;

Constitutional scholar Simon Lazarus countered critics, saying that the delay was a lawful discretion of Executive power: "In effect, the Administration explains the delay as a sensible adjustment to phase-in enforcement, not a refusal to enforce… To be sure, the federal [[Administrative Procedure Act (United States)|Administrative Procedure Act]] authorizes federal courts to compel agencies to initiate statutorily required actions that have been 'unreasonably delayed.' But courts have found delays to be unreasonable only in rare cases where, unlike this one, inaction had lasted for several years, and the recalcitrant agency could offer neither a persuasive excuse nor a credible end to its dithering."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Simon Lazarus|url= https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/07/delaying-parts-of-obamacare-blatantly-illegal-or-routine-adjustment/277873/ |title=Is Delaying Parts of Obamacare 'Blatantly Illegal' or Routine Adjustment? |publisher= The Atlantic |date=July 18, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sarah Kliff |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/08/07/the-white-house-keeps-changing-obamacare-is-that-legal/ |title=The White House keeps changing Obamacare.

In August, another provision was delayed for a year: the premium caps on group plans. This was to give employers time to arrange new accounting systems for the premium caps, but the caps are still planned to take effect on schedule for insurance plans on [[#Insurance exchanges and the individual mandate|the exchanges]].&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="newrepublic" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wonkwire.rollcall" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nymag" /&gt;

On 10 February 2014, the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department]] issued Treasury Decision 9655, which are final regulation, that it would delay the employer mandate until 2016 for employers with 50 to 99 workers.&lt;ref name="ACA EMPLOYER SHARED RESPONSIBILITY DELAY INCLUDED IN FINAL REGS"/&gt; The Treasury Decision 9655 modifies Proposed Regulations REG-138006-12.&lt;ref name="ACA EMPLOYER SHARED RESPONSIBILITY DELAY INCLUDED IN FINAL REGS"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6922">A '''religious reform''' (from Latin ''re'': back, again, and ''formare'': to form; i.e. put together: ''to restore, reconstruct, or rebuild'') aims at the reform of religious teachings. It is not to be confused with an organizational reform of a religious community, though mostly this is a consequence of a reform of religious teachings.

== Definition ==

Religious reforms are performed when a religious community reaches the conclusion that it deviated from its - assumed - true faith. Mostly religious reforms are started by parts of a religious community and meet resistance in other parts of the same religious community. Religious reforms usually lead to a reformulation of the religious teachings held for true, and to the condemnation resp. rejection of teachings held for wrong.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald L. Johnstone: [https://books.google.de/books/about/Religion_in_Society.html?id=11LuAAAAMAAJ Religion in Society: A Sociology of Religion], Pearson/Prentice Hall, 2006. pp. 134 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mostly the deviation from the assumed true faith which gives reason for a religious reform crept in over a longer period of time, sometimes over centuries. A religious reform is always a reorientation at the historical beginnings of a religion (therefore: ''re-formare'', reconstruct) under the perspective of the present time and with the knowledge of the present time. A typical example for deviations from an assumed true faith are social changes within society which lead a loss purpose for [[ethics|ethical]] prescriptions, so they have to be replaced by other ethical prescriptions in order to protect the underlying, unchanged value for the future. Another typical example is the factual falsification of traditional views, e.g. by better insights into historical events or into natural science, by which the traditional views are falsified.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. Hassan Butt: [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/jul/01/comment.religion1 My plea to fellow Muslims: you must renounce terror], in: The Guardian 01 July 2007; citation: "If our country is going to take on radicals and violent extremists, Muslim scholars must go back to the books and come forward with a refashioned set of rules and a revised understanding of the rights and responsibilities of Muslims whose homes and souls are firmly planted in what I'd like to term the Land of Co-existence. And when this new theological territory is opened up, Western Muslims will be able to liberate themselves from defunct models of the world, rewrite the rules of interaction and perhaps we will discover that the concept of killing in the name of Islam is no more than an anachronism."&lt;/ref&gt;

The eternally continuing change of society and the progress of human knowledge are the reasons why a "final" reform of religious teachings is not possible. Religious teachings have to be reformed again and again. This realization was formulated in a concise sentence by [[Karl Barth]] in 1947: ''[[Ecclesia semper reformanda est]]'', i.e. ''The church is always to be reformed.''&lt;ref&gt;Theodor Mahlmann: ''Ecclesia semper reformanda''. Eine historische Aufarbeitung. Neue Bearbeitung, in: Torbjörn Johansson, Robert Kolb, Johann Anselm Steiger (Hrsg.): Hermeneutica Sacra. Studien zur Auslegung der Heiligen Schrift im 16. und 17. Jahrhundert, Berlin - New York 2010, pp. 382-441, here pp. 384-388&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious reforms do not aim at an adjustment to the spirit of the time in the first place, yet they naturally bring about certain adjustments to the present time, since the religious tradition is reconsidered and reformed under the perspective of the present time and with the knowledge of the present time. A full adjustment of a religious teaching to the spirit of the present time cannot be expected from a credible religious reform. Religious reforms which do not aim at the reestablishment of an assumed true faith in the first place, yet at a mere adjustment of religious teaching to the spirit of the time without respect to an assumed true faith are no religious reforms, strictly speaking. Their purpose is questionable since those reforms are not based on the faith of the believers. Reforms of this nature are often based on compulsion and are usually not long-lasting but are reversed in the next generations. An example is the attempt of the Roman emperor Julian the Apostate to [[Julian (emperor)#Restoration of Paganism as state religion|restore paganism as state religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. the struggle for the meaning of ''[[Aggiornamento]]'' in the Catholic Church.&lt;/ref&gt;

The opponents of justified religious reforms are called traditionalists, their ideology is traditionalism. The adherents of reforms to adjust to the spirit of the time in the first place without respect for an assumed true faith are called modernists, their ideology is [[Modernism in the Catholic Church|modernism]]. Both concepts were coined by Christian-Catholic historical developments, yet today they are applied to all religions.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. e.g. title of: J. Schacht: [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4282132 Modernism and Traditionalism in a History of Islamic Law], in:  Middle Eastern Studies Vol. 1, No. 4 (Jul., 1965), pp. 388-400&lt;/ref&gt;

== Famous examples of religious reforms ==
* The [[Buddhist councils]] for the clarification of the teachings of the Buddha.
* The [[First Council of Nicaea]] for the clarification of the doctrine of the [[Trinity]], 325 AD.
* The movement of the Muslim [[Muʿtazila]] rejected wrong traditions, 9th to 11th century.
* The [[Protestant Reformation]] of 1517 by [[Martin Luther]], [[John Calvin]] and others.
* The introduction of the [[Historical Criticism#History|Historical-Critical Method]] in Christianity in the 19th and 20th century.
* The [[Second Vatican Council]] of the [[Catholic Church]], 1962-1965.

The party was founded by [[Paavo Väyrynen]], its president and only MP, after he was ousted from his previous party, [[Citizens' Party (Finland)|Citizens' Party]].

==History==
[[Paavo Väyrynen]] had successfully run for the [[Finnish Parliament]] in the [[Finnish parliamentary election, 2015]], representing the [[Centre Party (Finland)|Centre Party]]. Väyrynen, however, chose to forfeit his seat in order to serve in the [[European Parliament]] that he had entered earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Paavo Väyrynen palasi eduskuntaan |last=Lehto |first=Mika |work=Ilta-Sanomat |date=12 June 2018 |access-date=19 November 2018 |url= https://www.is.fi/politiikka/art-2000005716018.html |language=fi  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Väyrynen returned to the Finnish Parliament in June 2018, but defected from the Centre Party to [[Citizens' Party (Finland)|Citizens' Party]] which he had founded. The party was, however, already at that time engulfed in a power struggle that resulted in Väyrynen's ouster. In late June, Väyrynen announced that he had founded the Seven Star Movement as a substitute for Citizens' Party, with which he remained in the parliament for a time. The name is inspired by the populist Italian [[Five Star Movement]]. The Seven Star Movement's goals are [[political independence]], [[Neutral country|non-alignment]], and greater [[immigration control]].&lt;ref name=Centre&gt;{{Cite web |title=Ex-Centre elder Paavo Väyrynen sets up yet another party |work=Yle News |date=27 July 2018 |access-date=19 November 2018 |url= https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/ex-centre_elder_paavo_vayrynen_sets_up_yet_another_party/10326386 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A trial court ruled in November 2018 that Väyrynen's ouster had been illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Kansalaispuolue aikoo valittaa hoviin ratkaisusta, jonka mukaan Väyrysen erottaminen oli laiton – 'Mahdoton hyväksyä' |last=de Fresnes |first=Tuulikukka |work=Yle News |date=6 November 2018 |access-date=19 November 2018 |url= https://yle.fi/uutiset/3-10494408 |language=fi  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the ruling, the legal woes promoted Väyrynen to go forward with his Seven Star Movement rather than Citizens' Party. Later that month, Väyrynen announced that he had officially aligned himself with the {{ill|Seven Star Movement's parliamentary group|fi|Tähtiliikkeen eduskuntaryhmä}}, whose only MP he became.&lt;ref name=EU/&gt; Väyrynen is the president of the party.

'''Greyshirts''' or '''''Gryshemde''''' is the common short-form name given to the '''South African Gentile National Socialist Movement''', a [[South Africa]]n [[Nazism|Nazi]] movement that existed during the 1930s and 1940s. Initially referring only to a paramilitary group, it soon became shorthand for the movement as a whole.

The [[NSDAP/AO]] arrived in South Africa in 1932 and as a result a number of groups sympathetic to Nazism emerged. The most notable of these was the South African Gentile National Socialist Movement (also known as the South African Christian National Socialist Movement), formed by [[Louis Weichardt]] the following year.&lt;ref name="Payne"&gt;[[Stanley G. Payne]], ''A History of Fascism 1914-45'', London: Routledge, 2001, p. 338&lt;/ref&gt; A fiercely [[anti-Semitism|anti-Semitic]] group, it organised the Gryshemde as its equivalent of the [[Sturmabteilung]], although the grey shirt became so associated with the group that it was applied to the movement as a whole. In contrast to some extremist groups the Greyshirts did not split along linguistic lines, but rather sought to work with both the [[Afrikaans]] and the [[English language|English]]-speaking populations.&lt;ref&gt;Aletta J. Norval, ''Deconstructing Apartheid Discourse'', p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greyshirts struggled to maintain unity and spawned a number of minor splinter groups, such as Johannes von Moltke's South African Fascists. Most of these groups united under [[Daniel François Malan]]'s aegis when he formed his [['Purified' National Party]], although the Greyshirts did not take part and contested the [[South African general election, 1938|1938 election]] alone. The decision proved unwise, however, as the Greyshirts failed to make any impact.&lt;ref name="Payne"/&gt; The group was roundly attacked by the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]], with an article appearing in ''[[Die Burger]]'' in October 1934 stating that: 'We believe that this party, generally known as the Greyshirts, under the cloak of an anti-Jewish movement, strives for a dangerous form of government in South Africa. The Greyshirts have as their aim to set up a dictator in South Africa.'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anc.org.za/books/reich4.html Followers of Hitler] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715031456/http://www.anc.org.za/books/reich4.html |date=2007-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jew]]ish immigration from [[Nazi Germany]] to South Africa grew significantly during the 1930s and the Greyshirts launched a campaign calling for an end to the practice. A ship was chartered by the Council for German Jewry, a UK-based group, to bring as many Jews as possible to [[Cape Town]], leading to the Greyshirts organising a mass protest against the move. The scale of opposition was such that [[Sarah Millin]] appealed to [[Jan Smuts]] to deal with the Greyshirts, although her request was ignored.&lt;ref&gt;Claudia Bathsheba Braude, 'Introduction', ''Contemporary Jewish Writing in South Africa: An Anthology''&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, relations between the National Party and the Greyshirts actually improved, initially as a result of a 1937 letter from [[Frans Erasmus]], at the time Secretary of the National Party, praising the Greyshirts for bringing the "Jewish problem" to the fore and culminating in a number of leading Greyshirts also holding National Party membership.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Bunting, ''The Rise of the South African Reich'', Penguin Books, 1969, pp. 64-65&lt;/ref&gt;

Activities were monitored during the [[Second World War]], although the Greyshirts continued to exist and renamed themselves the White Workers Party in 1949. However, by this time most of the membership had been lost to the [[Herenigde Nasionale Party]] and so the Greyshirts faded.&lt;ref name="Payne"/&gt;

'''Take Back Parliament - Lebanon ''' ({{lang-ar|إسترجعوا البرلمان}}), (TBP - Lebanon) is a political movement launched by several Lebanese activists who met through various social organizations and civil initiatives. Social media has played a significant role in helping to expand the group. The grassroots campaign was created as an alternative to the gridlock between the two existing political alliances in Lebanon, the [[March 8 Alliance]] and [[March 14 Alliance]]. The group members crowd-sourced to build an [[#Agenda|electoral platform]] which is the ideal political agenda they would like to see candidates represent. The political agenda calls for a democratic secular nonsectarian government, bringing social justice awareness, and an eventual end to corruption.

== Values ==
- '''Practice that reflects Principles''': TBP strives to reflect its values in its internal organizing. &lt;br&gt;
- '''Zero Budget''': TBP did not hire any staff; the endeavor is completely dependent on volunteers. &lt;br&gt;
- '''Transparency''': TBP only asks for donations to pay necessary fees and bills and has pledged to make its accounts and spendings transparent. &lt;br&gt;
- '''Direct Democracy''': TBP promotes direct democracy as its internal way of organizing and as a viable democratic system for Lebanon. &lt;br&gt;
- '''Accountability''': The campaign is built on open, honest, and friendly accountability mechanisms of individuals, groups, and decisions within the group.&lt;br&gt;
- '''Grassroots Organizing''': TBP members believe in a bottom-up approach to political change in Lebanon. They did not seek mainstream media campaigns and have announced knocking on doors and taking the time to speak to people individually.&lt;br&gt;
- '''Faith in the Impossible''': TBP members admit that their project might seem impossible but say that they have trust in the power of the people.

== Agenda ==
TBP was created to challenge what it calls the total inefficiency of the current and previous Lebanese parliaments and their disconnect from the daily lives of citizens. TBP members crowd-sourced and contacted various experts and NGOs to build agenda papers regarding the following issues:

In the United States, the phrase '''testing the waters''' is used to describe someone who is exploring the feasibility of becoming a candidate for political office.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fec.gov/rad/candidates/documents/CanGuideTestWater_000.pdf |accessdate=July 2, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703075138/http://www.fec.gov/rad/candidates/documents/CanGuideTestWater_000.pdf |archivedate=July 3, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost1"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/24/campaign-finance-law-2016_n_6932834.html |title='Testing The Waters': The Unseen Significance Of A Candidate Cliche |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date=2015-03-24 |accessdate=2015-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Testing the waters" activities are to be paid for with candidate-permissible funds.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost1"/&gt; Once an individual begins to campaign or decides to become a candidate, funds that were raised or spent to "test the waters" apply to the $5,000 threshold for qualifying as a candidate.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; This is because there is a [[federal law]] that once an individual raises or spends $5,000 for a campaign, they are required to register as a [[federal candidate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://patch.com/illinois/deerfield/nancy-rotering-accused-violating-federal-campaign-law-0 |title=Nancy Rotering Accused of Violating Federal Campaign Law By Conservative Group &amp;#124; Deerfield, IL Patch |publisher=Patch.com |date=2015-07-01 |accessdate=2015-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Once that threshold is exceeded, the individual must register with the [[Federal Election Commission]] (FEC) (candidates for the [[United States House of Representatives]]) or the [[Secretary of the Senate]] (candidates for the [[United States Senate]]), and begin to file reports (including in the first report all activity that occurred prior to reaching the $5,000 threshold).&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

Once an individual registers as a federal candidate, election restrictions apply, including 2,700 dollars on contributions.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/04/us/politics/jeb-bush-taking-his-time-tests-the-legal-definition-of-candidate.html|title=Jeb Bush, Taking His Time, Tests the Legal Definition of Candidate|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2015-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, once registered as a candidate, individuals cannot coordinate with [[political action committee]]s (PACs) or [[Super PAC]]s under [[Campaign finance in the United States|campaign finance law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/jeb-bush-eyes-new-role-for-his-super-pac-during-2016-campaign/ |title=Jeb Bush eyes new role for his super PAC during 2016 campaign |date=April 21, 2015 |accessdate=June 15, 2015 |publisher=Cbsnews.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reporting on "testing the waters"==
On July 1st, it was reported that Nancy Rotering allegedly received donations for her congressional campaign in excess of $5,000 as early as January and did not officially register as a candidate with the FEC until March.

On June 18, 2015, it was reported that [[Scott Walker (politician)|Scott Walker]] had formed a "testing the waters" committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lovelace |first=Ryan |url=http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/scott-walker-forms-a-testing-the-waters-committee/article/2566521 |title=Scott Walker forms a 'testing the waters' committee |publisher=Washington Examiner |date=2015-06-18 |accessdate=2015-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 4, 2015, it as reported that the [[Campaign Legal Center]], a nonpartisan legal organization, filed complaints with the Federal Election Commission against Democrat [[Martin O’Malley]] and Republicans Jeb Bush, Rick Santorum and Scott Walker alleging violations of federal law “testing the waters.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/campaign/243828-republican-fec-commissioner-admittedly-blocking-complaints |title=Republican FEC commissioner admittedly blocking complaints against Republicans |publisher=TheHill |date=2015-06-04 |accessdate=2015-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 3, 2015, it was reported that as of June 3, [[Jeb Bush]] was still "testing the waters", and had not registered as a federal candidate.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt;

On April 9, 2015, it was reported that [[Rick Santorum]] set up a "testing the waters" account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/9/rick-santorum-sets-testing-waters-account-ahead-po/ |title=Rick Santorum sets up 'testing the waters' account ahead of possible 2016 W.H. bid |publisher=Washington Times |date= |accessdate=2015-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some academics argue that International Resource Privilege remains because arrangements between global institutions tend to be struck without adequate concern for their thoroughgoing effects on the global poor. One example is that it provides additional incentive to overthrowing governments, which in turn contributes to a cycle of political instability where a promising government might just as soon be toppled as a brutal military regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rasper|first1=Anke|title='Poverty is a massive crime against humanity'|url=http://www.dw.de/poverty-is-a-massive-crime-against-humanity/a-16936635|accessdate=1 March 2015|agency=Deutsche Welle|date=December 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schweickart|first1=David|title=Global Poverty: Alternative Perspectives on What We Should Do-and Why|journal=Journal of Social Philosophy|date=December 2008|volume=39|issue=4|pages=471–491|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9833.2008.00438.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is little incentive for foreign governments to challenge the situation because they benefit from it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McKinnon|first1=edited by Catriona|title=Issues in political theory|date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780199572823|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Washington Post quotes [[Thomas Pogge]] as saying “most of us do not merely let people starve, but also participate in starving them.” &lt;ref name=post&gt;{{cite news|last1=Matthews|first1=Dylan|title=Americans already think a third of the budget goes to foreign aid.

Thomas Pogge argues that we are.

== Philosophical Response ==

[[Mathias Risse]] calls the resource and borrowing privilege "The Cosmopolitan Complaint". He does acknowledge that the global order provides incentives for it but attributes oppression to the sheer desire to rule.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6172">{{Italic title}}'''''The Rise of Victimhood Culture: Microaggressions, Safe Spaces, and the New Culture Wars''''', is a 2018 book by sociologists [[Bradley Campbell (sociologist)|Bradley Campbell]] and [[Jason Manning]].

==History==
The book began as a scholarly paper entitled ''Microaggression and Moral Cultures'' published in the journal ''Comparative Sociology'' in 2014.&lt;ref name=CompSoc&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Campbell |first1=Bradley |last2=Manning |first2=Jason |title=Microaggression and Moral Cultures |journal=Comparative Sociology |date=2014 |volume=13 |issue=6 |page=692 |url=http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/15691330-12341332}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Friedersdorf"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Friedersdorf |first1=Conor |title=The Rise of Victimhood Culture |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/09/the-rise-of-victimhood-culture/404794/ |accessdate=31 May 2018 |publisher=[[The Atlantic]] |date=11 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Campbell and Manning argue that accusations of [[microaggression]] focus on unintentional slights, unlike the [[Civil rights movement]], which focused on concrete injustices.  They argue that the purpose of calling attention to microaggressions is less to elevate the status of offended victim. "When the victims publicize micoaggressions,” wrote  Campbell and Manning “they call attention to what they see as the deviant behavior of the offenders. In doing so,” they “also call attention to their own victimization.”   They do this because it lowers “the offender’s moral status” and “raises the moral status of the victims.”&lt;ref name=CompSoc/&gt;&lt;ref name="BarbashCampuses"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Barbash |first1=Fred |title=The war on ‘microaggressions:’ Has it created a ‘victimhood culture’ on campuses? |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/10/28/the-war-over-words-literally-on-some-american-campuses-where-asking-where-are-you-from-is-a-microaggression/ |accessdate=1 June 2018 |publisher=Washington Post |date=28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WayneAbout"/&gt;

==Thesis==
In both the paper and the book, Mason and Campbell draw on the work of sociologist [[Donald Black (sociologist)|Donald Black]] on conflict and on cross-cultural studies of conflict and morality to argue that the contemporary culture wars resemble tactics described by scholars in which an aggrieved party or group seeks the support of third parties.  They argue that  grievance-based conflicts ave led to large-scale moral change in which an emergent victimhood culture is clashing with and replacing older honor and dignity cultures.&lt;ref name=CompSoc/&gt;

Honour cultures, often called [[shame society|honour-shame cultures]] are cultures like that of the [[old west|old time American West]] or Europe in the era when dueling was common.&lt;ref name="Friedersdorf"/&gt;  In such cultures, honour is paramount, and when it is offended, the offended party retaliated directly, by, for example, engaging in a [[blood feud]].  In honor cultures, victims have an extremely low moral status.&lt;ref name="WayneAbout"/&gt;

Mason and Campbell describe honour-shame culture as having been replaced in the modern Western world in the 19th and 20th century by a dignity culture where, “insults might provoke offense, but they no longer have the same importance as a way of establishing or destroying a reputation for bravery.” Instead, “When intolerable conflicts do arise, dignity cultures prescribe direct but non-violent actions.”&lt;ref name=CompSoc/&gt;&lt;ref name="Friedersdorf"/&gt;  In such a culture, instead of challenging the offender to a duel, an aggrieved party might “exercise covert avoidance, quietly cutting off relations with the offender without any confrontation” or  “conceptualize the problem as a disruption to their relationship and seek only to restore harmony without passing judgment.” Legal action was taken, “For offenses like theft, assault, or breach of contract, people in a dignity culture will use law without shame,... “But in keeping with their ethic of restraint and toleration, it is not necessarily their first resort, and they might condemn many uses of the authorities as frivolous. People might even be expected to tolerate serious but accidental personal injuries.”&lt;ref name=CompSoc/&gt;&lt;ref name="Friedersdorf"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HennenReview"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hennen |first1=Anthony |title=The Dictatorship of the Offended(Book Review) |url=https://www.jamesgmartin.center/2018/04/the-dictatorship-of-the-offended/ |accessdate=1 June 2018 |publisher=James G. Martin Center for Academic Renewal |date=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A dignity culture, according to Campbell and Manning, has moral values and behavioral norms that promote the value of every human life, encouraging achievement in its children while teaching that [[Sticks and Stones|sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never break me]].&lt;ref name="CampbellReview"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Campbell |first1=Claire |title=The War on Dignity (book review) |publisher=[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]] |date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because victimhood culture now confers the highest moral status on victims, Campbell and Manning argue that it “increases the incentive to publicize grievances.”  Injured and offended parties who might once have thrown a punch or filed a law suit, now  appeal for support on social media.&lt;ref name="WayneAbout"/&gt;

According to Campbell and  Manning, victimhood culture engenders “competitive victimhood,” incentivizing even privileged people to claim that they are victims of, for example [[reverse discrimination]].&lt;ref name="WayneAbout"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Wayne |first1=Teddy |title=The Microcomplaint: Nothing Too Small to Whine About |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/15/fashion/the-microcomplaint-nothing-too-small-to-whine-about.html |accessdate=1 June 2018 |publisher=New York Times |date=13 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26862">The following is a timeline of the '''[[Gwangmu Reform]]''', which was a reforms for modernize Korea from the late 19th century to the early 20th century. Although many people have the notion that this period was marked with the fight for power between Heungseon Daewongun (흥선대원군, 興宣大院君 - King Gojong's father) and Queen Min (King Gojong's wife), it was rather the era of great changes relevant to modernisation after the harsh oppressive years during the "Regency" of King Gojong's father. This reform also was one of the most successful for [[modernization|modernising]] in a short period of time during Korean history. Although the reform was mostly centred on the time period after the proclamation of the Korean Empire, it includes a number of other previous events that are closely related to the reform.

==Early modernizations (1883–94)==
Phase one of the [[Gwangmu Reform]] began with the first Korean delegation to America, and opening up for modernisation. Because of recurring Chinese interventions led by [[Li Hongzhang]] (이홍장,李鴻章), there was relatively less development of Chosun compared to Phase Three. The main innovator in this phase is [[Queen Min]].

*1883: March. The Korea-Japanese Underground Cable Construction Treaty (조일해저전선부설조약,朝日海底電線敷設條約) was signed by Korea and Japan. This led to a telegraphic connection between [[Busan]] (부산,釜山) and [[Nagasaki]] (長崎).
*1883: May. American minister [[Lucius Foote]] arrived to take command of the modernization of Chosun's older army units that had not started Westernizing. 
[[Image:Hanseong Sunbo 1883.jpg|thumb|120px|left|''[[Hanseong sunbo]]'', the first modern newspaper in Korea]]
*1883: July. The first delegate to America was sent by the Chosun government. The Ministry of Presswork and Publication (박문국,博文局)was opened for the modernisation of the printing industry.
*1883: August. The first edition of the [[Hanseong sunbo]] (한성순보,漢城旬報) was published on this year. This is the first newspaper to be published in Chosun. 
*1884: The Daedong Corporation (대동상회,大同商會), the first modern domestic corporation in Korea, was established.
*1885: February. The first Royal Medical Clinic, the '''[[Gwanghyewon]] (광혜연,廣惠院)''' was opened with the introduction of modern medicine by [[Horace Newton Allen]]. The name changed to Jaejoongwon (제중원,濟衆院) a month later.
*1885: May. [[Presbyterianism]] is introduced to Chosun by [[Horace Grant Underwood]]. Many other Christian pastors came to Chosun, which became the fundamental background for religious freedom and equality between Koreans.
*1885: July. The Korea-Chinese Cable Treaty (조청전선조약,朝淸電線條約) is signed and enforced, leading to a telegraphic connection between [[Hanseong]] and [[Peking]].
*1885: August. Establishment of the [[Pai Chai University|Baejae Hakdang]] (배재학당,培材學堂) by [[Henry Appenzeller]]. Although initially recognised as an 'Academy', it became a college in 1895.
*1886: February. Proclamation of abolishment of [[slavery]] inheritance within Chosun. This is the unofficial start of equalisation of people within the kingdom. It also paved the way for abolishment of slavery in the [[Gabo Reform]]. 
*1886: May. Queen Min gave her patronage to the first all-girls' educational institution, '''Ewha Academy (이화학당,梨花學堂) ''', established in Seoul by American missionary, [[Mary F. Scranton]]. This institution later became the [[Ewha University]] (이화여자대학교,梨花女子大學校). 
[[File:Manhwa-Yu.Gil-jun-Yahak-01.jpg|thumb|130px|right|A cartoon that shows a former [[Yangban]] and a commoner using the same speech level.]]
*1886: September. There also was the establishment of the Yukyeong-gongwon (육영공원,育英公院). This was the first [[state school|public school]] to be opened in Chosun. 
*1887: March. The Korean Imperial Telegraphic Office (조선전보총국,朝鮮電報總局) was opened for a more efficient management of the telegraphic lines operating in Korea. The office was in use until 1893, when it became into the Korean Imperial Telegraphic and Postal Office (전우총국,電郵總局).
*1887: October. American missionary Scranton establishes the first women's hospital, the Lillian Harris Memorial Hospital (보구여관,普救女館). The hospital also operated the first medical class for women. One of the students went to the Woman’s Medical College of Baltimore, becoming the first female doctor at Korea in 1900.
*1888: February. 1888, General [[William McEntyre Dye]] and two other military instructors arrived from the US, followed in May by a fourth instructor. The Americans taught at the first modern military academy called the '''Yeonmu-gongwon (연무공원,鍊武公院)''' and trained many Koreans.
*1888: May. Korea independently constructs the Southern Cable Line (남로전선,南路電線), connecting Hanseong and Busan.
*1890: January. The Korean Merchant's Association for Fairness is opened by Kim Jae-jun(김재전,金在田), Lee Gun-seo (이군서,李君瑞) and Park Myung-gyu(박명규朴明珪). The Association promoted usage of foreign weight and measurement standards in the domestic market. It had offices in Incheon, Wonsan and Busan. 
*1891: February. The Korean Northern Cable Treaty (조선북로전선조약,朝鮮北路電線條約) is signed by China and Korea. By this treaty, the telegraphic service from Seoul to [[Wonsan]] is in operation.
*1892: Issuance of the '''Baekdonghwa (백동화,白銅貨)''', with the enforcement of the New Currency Regulations (신식화폐조례,新式貨幣條例). Although it caused some chaos on which currency to use, it also stabilised the inflation within the peninsula.
*1893: March. The '''[[Korean Imperial Naval Academy]] (통제영학당,統制營學堂)''' is established. The academy produces approximately 160 officers before its close during and after the [[First Sino-Japanese War]].
*1894: February. The outbreak of the '''[[Donghak Peasant Revolution]] (동학농민운동,東學農民運動)'''. The communication between the [[Donghak]] faction and King Gojong were smooth until Japanese intervention- which led to the [[First Sino-Japanese War]].

==Japanese interventions (1894–97)==
[[File:Kim Hong-Jip.jpg|thumb|120px|right|Kim Hong-jip (1842–96), prime minister of the Gabo Government]]
This phase does not show much development within the Korean Peninsula. It is a brief period of intense power struggle between Japan and Russia, competing to expand their influence in the peninsula.

*1894:  June. The [[Gabo Reform]] (갑오개혁,甲午改革) is initiated by Prime Minister [[Kim Hong-jip]] (김홍집,金弘集), Park Jung-yang (박정양,朴定陽),Kim Yun-sik (김윤식,金允植), Cho Hei-yeon (조희연,趙羲淵), Kim Ga-jin (김가진,金嘉鎭), An Gyung-su (안경수,安駉壽), Kim Hak-wu (김학우,金鶴羽) and Yu Gil-jun (유길준,兪吉濬). The heteronomous reform ends in February the next year. It was an attempt of Japan by using Japanophile Korean officials to change Korea into a system more like Japan, for an easier administration of Korea after its annexation.
[[Image:Young Philip Jaisohn.jpg|thumb|110px|left|[[Seo Jae-pil]], the founder of the [[Independence Club]].]]
*1895:  8 October. [[Empress Myeongseong]] (명성황후,明成皇后) is assassinated by Japanese agents under [[Miura Gorō|Miura Goro]](三浦梧樓). Japan gets much criticism from other modern countries about such barbaric methods, and therefore arrests Miura as a matter of formality. After spending some time in Hiroshima prison, however, he is released due to the "lack of evidence".
*1896:  11 February. '''King Gojong fled to the Russian legation in Seoul (아관파천,俄館播遷)'''.
*1896:  2 July. Establishment of the [[Independence Club]] by [[Seo Jae-pil]] (서재필,徐載弼). It is to be noted that Seo took part in the [[Gapsin Coup]] (갑신정변,甲申政變) in 1884. Some people related to the coup d’État were Kim Ok-gyun (김옥균,金玉均) and Park Yung-hyo (박영효,朴泳孝).

==Later modernizations  (1897–1905)==
Phase two of the Gwangmu Reform began with the proclamation of the [[Korean Empire]] on 4 October 1897. Efforts for modernisation were spurred with the coronation of Gojong as Emperor but were restrained by Japan after the [[Russo-Japanese War]] in 1905. The main innovator in this phase is [[Gojong of the Korean Empire|Emperor Gojong]].

*1897:  February. King Gojong established the [[Board of Marshals|Board of Marshals (원수부,元帥府)]]. All military power was henceforth centralized to the Emperor.
*1897:  20 February. King [[Gojong of the Korean Empire|Gojong]] (고종,高宗) returned to the palace after 1 year of refuge at the Russian legation.
*1897:  September. The Donghwa Pharmacy opened in Seoul, Korea. The established corporation, now known as the Dong Wha Pharmacy Corporation., Limited (동화약품(주),同和藥品(株)). The company, now the oldest pharmacy-based corporation in Korea, has products that are nationally famous, with its 'folding fan' trademark.
*1897:  October. Gojong declares the '''[[Korean Empire]] (대한제국,大韓帝國)''' and became the Gwangmu Emperor, the first imperial head of state and hereditary sovereign of the Empire of Korea. Most historians view this as the official declaration of the Gwangmu Reform (광무개혁,光武改革). Soongsil Academy was founded in Pyongyang as a private school by Dr. [[William M. Baird]], a missionary of the Northern Presbyterian Church of America. The [[Soongsil University]] is its descendant.
*1897:  November. [[John McLeavy Brown]] constructed his lasting legacy upon the Korean Empire- the [[Tapgol Park|Pagoda Park]]. It is notable the [[March 1st Movement]], an important part in the [[Korean independence movement]] was initiated in this park.
*1898:  January. The Seoul Electric Corporation (한성전기회사,漢城電氣會社), or the Korea-American Electric Corporation (한미전기회사,韓美電氣會社) was opened as a [[Joint venture|joint-venture]] company between Americans Henry Collbran, H.R.Bostwick and Emperor Gojong. A public corporation it was responsible for the construction of the streetp lamps in Seoul, along with imports of numerous other electricity-related devices. The [[Korea Electric Power Corporation]] (한국전력공사,韓國電力公社) is its descendant.
*1898:  May. The '''Jong-hyun Catholic Church (종현본당,鐘峴本堂)''' was finished of construction. It was the first [[Gothic architecture]] to be built in Korea. It was later called the [[Myeongdong Cathedral]] (명동성당,明洞聖堂), the centre of the Korean 20th century. It is registered as a national historical landmark.
*1898:  August. Brown reported blueprint of the Pan-Korean railway to Gojong.
*1898:  September. Kim Hong-nyuk (김홍륙,金鴻陸) attempted assassination of Gojong by putting excess amount of [[opium]] in his coffee. It is to be noted that Gojong was a [[coffee]] lover. While Gojong spat out the coffee upon drinking it, his son [[Sunjong]] (순종,純宗) drank the opium-tainted coffee and suffered from mental and physical disabilities from the incident.
*1898:  September 5. The [[Hwangseong Sinmun|Imperial Capital Gazette]] released its first print. The president of the company was Nam Gung-euk (남궁억,南宮檍).
[[File:The West Gate of Seoul, Korean Empire (대한제국 서대문역).jpg|thumb|180px|right|The West Gate of Seoul]]
*1899:  January. Several Korean entrepreneurs and high-ranking officials, such as Sim Sang-hun (심상훈,沈相薰), Minister of Agriculture Min Byung-suk (민병석,閔丙奭), Field Marshal Min Yung-gi (민영기,閔泳綺), Vice-minister of Justice Yi Geun-ho (이근호,李根澔), Head of the Treasury (전환국장,典圜局長) Yi yong-ik (이용익,李容翊), Minister of National Defense (원수부군무국장,元帥府軍務局長) Jo dong-yun (조동윤,趙東潤), Song Mun-sup (송문섭,宋文燮), Jung yung-du (정영두,鄭永斗) and Kim gi-young (김기영,金基永) established the '''Daehan Chunil Bank (대한천일은행,大韓天一銀行)'''. The bank operated as both a local bank and [[central bank]]. The bank is the predecessor of the [[Woori Bank]].
*1899:  April. The Gwangjaewon (광제원,廣濟院), the first modern [[Public hospital|national hospital]], opened. It is the present-day [[Seoul National University Hospital]], which is one of the biggest hospital in South Korea and a forerunner in many fields of [[Healthcare science|medical sciences]].
*1899:  May. American businessmen Henry Collbran and H.R.Bostwick opened the first [[Tramway track|tram lines]] within Seoul (the West gate-East gate line).
*1899:  August. The promulgation of the '''Korean Imperial Legislation''' (대한제국국제,大韓帝國國制) by the Ministry of Justice (법규교정소,法規校正所). This is of certain significance, as it led to Gojong's success in modernisation of the empire. It also took international laws into consideration. Although the actual legislation is very short, numerous other edicts were proclaimed to be used like laws.
*1899:  September. The establishment of the Northwest Railway Bureau (서북철도국,西北鐵道局), an agency within the [[Gungnaebu]] (궁내부,宮內府). Its mission was to construct a railway from Seoul to [[Sinuiju]] (신의주,新義州) without the help from foreign countries. This department later became the [[Korail]], or the Korea Railroad Corporation (한국철도공사,韓國鐵道公社). 
*1900:  January. Korean Empire became a member of the [[Universal Postal Union]]. 
*1900:  April. '''Construction of [[streetlamp]]s on [[Jongno|Jong-ro]]''', Seoul. The Korean Empire opens its own exhibition pavilion in the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Exposition Universelle]] of Paris.
[[File:Hospital during the Korean Empire.jpg|thumb|220px|right|The Dae-han National hospital, the first national hospital opened in Korea]]
*1900:  July. Seoul-[[Incheon]] railroad opened with completion of the Han River Bridge (한강철교,漢江鐵橋). The bridge later becomes part of the Hangang Railway Bridge. It is still in operation.
*1900:  October. The '''Hanseung Secondary School (한성중학교,漢城中學校)''' was finished construction. It is the predecessor of [[Kyunggi High School]] (경기고등학교,京畿高等學校), one of the best high schools in Korea.
*1901:  February. Proclamation of ordinances for the new currency (adoption of the [[Gold Standard]]). [[Franz Eckert]] arrived to Seoul for establishment of the Korean Imperial Marching Band. He composed the [[Korean Empire Aegukga|Korean Imperial National Anthem]]. It is to be noted he also composed the [[Kimigayo]], the Japanese counterpart.
*1901:  March. The [[Belgium–Korea Treaty of 1901]] (조백수호통상조약,朝白修好通商條約) is signed by Jae-sun Park (박제순,朴齊純), delegate of the Korean Empire and Leon Vincart, the Belgian counterpart. It is notable the treaty was not terminated, unlike many others after the Korea-Japanese 1905 Treaty.
*1901:  October. Inauguration of the '''Jigye Ahmun (지계아문,地契衙門)''', a system to issue legal documents of property ownership (지계,地契). It marks the start of a modern [[cadastral]] survey project.

Gojong initiated this by a confidential invitation from the former Russian Tsar, [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]]. While Hulbert lured the Japanese spies into the wrong path, the three Koreans went to the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague conference]]. However, they were blocked by the Japanese for the reasons that they were not nation-states even though they were on the list of invitation. Undaunted, they sought for interest of the press and found hope. Two notable figures they gained attention of are [[Bertha von Suttner]] and [[William Thomas Stead]].

A '''Universal Monarchy''' is a concept and a political situation where one monarchy is deemed to have either sole rule over everywhere (or at least the predominant part of a [[geopolitical]] area or areas) or to have a special supremacy over all other states (or at least all the states in a geopolitical area or areas).

==Concept==

Universal Monarchy is differentiated from ordinary [[monarchy]] in that a Universal Monarchy is beholden to no other state and asserts a degree of total sovereignty over an area, or predominance over other states.

The concept has arisen in [[Europe]] and [[Asia]]. The concept is linked to that of [[Empire]], but implies more than simply possessing ''[[imperium]]''.

The Latin phrase ''Dominus Mundi'', Lord of the World, encapsulates the concept. Though in practice no Universal Monarchy ever held rule over the whole world, it may have appeared to many people, particularly pre-modern, that it did.

Critical of the concept in Europe in the Middle Ages were philosophers such as [[Nicole Oresme]]&lt;ref&gt;Mastnak, Tomaž ''Crusading peace: Christendom, the Muslim world, and Western political order'' University of California Press (2002) p329&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Erasmus]];&lt;ref&gt;Persson, Hans-Åke &amp;  Stråth, Bo ''Reflections on Europe: defining a political order in time and space'' Peter Lang (2007) pp51-52&lt;/ref&gt; whereas [[Dante]] and [[Guillaume Postel]]&lt;ref&gt;Kuntz, Marion Leathers ''Guillaume Postel, prophet of the restitution of all things: his life and thought'' Springer (1981) p171&lt;/ref&gt; were more favourable. Later, [[Protestants]] would seek to reject the concept, identifying it with [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]].&lt;ref&gt;Simms, Brendan &amp; Riotte, Torsten (Editors) ''The Hanoverian dimension in British History, 1714-1837'' Cambridge University Press (2007) pp168-169&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Europe===
In Europe the expression of a Universal Monarchy as actual total ''imperium'' can be seen in the [[Roman Empire]], and as the predominate ‘sole sovereign’ state during its [[Byzantine]] period, where the Emperor by virtue of being the head of [[Christendom]] claimed a sovereignty over all other kings even though in practice this could not be enforced. The Byzantine conception went through two phases, initially as expounded by [[Eusebius]] that just as there was one God so there could only be one Emperor,&lt;ref&gt;Nicol, D.M. ''Byzantine political thought'' in Burns, J. H.  ''The Cambridge history of medieval political thought c. 350-c. 1450'' Cambridge University Press 1988 pp52-53&lt;/ref&gt; which developed in the 10th century into the conception of the Emperor as the ''[[paterfamilias]]'' of a family of kings who were the other rulers in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Nicol, D.M. ''Byzantine political thought'' in Burns, J. H.  ''The Cambridge history of medieval political thought c. 350-c. 1450'' Cambridge University Press 1988 p57&lt;/ref&gt;  Such concepts were a feature of the [[Ottoman Empire]] successor state, particularly when military rule was augmented by the [[Caliphate]].

The idea of a sole sovereign Emperor would re-emerge in the West with [[Charlemagne]] and the [[Holy Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Bryce, James ''The Holy Roman Empire'' p209&lt;/ref&gt;  The idea of the Holy Roman Empire possessing a special sovereignty as a Universal Monarchy was respected by the surrounding powers and subject states, even when that Empire had undergone severe fragmentation.&lt;ref&gt;Brissaud, Jean ''A History of French Public Law'' John Murray (1915) p77&lt;/ref&gt;  The symbolism of the [[A.E.I.O.U.]] phrase of [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]] can be seen as an expression of the idea of all states being subject to one monarchy.

[[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]’s empire, encompassing much of western Europe and the Americas “was the nearest the post-classical world would come to seeing a truly world-wide monarchy, and hence the closest approximation to universal imperium” since the Roman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Armitage, David ''The Ideological Origins of the British Empire'' Cambridge University Press (2000) p32&lt;/ref&gt; It was envisaged by its supporters as a world empire that could be religiously inclusive.&lt;ref&gt;Ocker, Christopher,  Printy ,Michael &amp;  Starenko, Peter (Editors) ''Politics and Reformations: Communities, Politics, Nations, and Empires'' Brill Academic Publishers (2007), 495.&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, the idea of a Universal Monarchy based on predominance rather than actual total rule would become synonymous with France attempting to establish hegemony over western Europe, particularly under [[Louis XIV]],&lt;ref&gt;Simms, Brendan &amp; Riotte, Torsten (Editors)''The Hanoverian dimension in British History, 1714-1837'' Cambridge University Press (2007) p168&lt;/ref&gt; exemplified by the concept of Louis XIV as the 'Sun King' around which all the other monarchs became subordinate satellites. In 1755, during the reign of Louis XIV's successor [[Louis XV]], Duke [[Adrien Maurice de Noailles]], a member of the Council of State and formerly a key foreign policy advisor to the king, warned of a British challenge for "the first rank in Europe" through the domination of Atlantic commerce. Noailles wrote "However chimerical the project of universal monarchy might be, that of a universal influence by means of wealth would cease to be a chimera if a nation succeeded in making itself sole mistress of the trade of America."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shovlin |first=John |date=2010 |title=Selling American Empire on the Eve of the Seven Years War: The French Propaganda Campaign of 1755-1756 |journal=Past and Present |volume=206 |issue=1 |pages=121–149 |doi=10.1093/pastj/gtp046 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Universal Monarchy would flourish at either end of Europe, in Britain and Russia. The Russian Universal Monarchy was [[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]], [[Autocracy|autocratic]] and possessed a vast contiguous empire throughout Europe and Asia and can be seen to have similarities and differences with Byzantine rule.&lt;ref&gt;Gavrov, Sergey [http://ru.wikipedia.org/?oldid=48502217]''Modernization of the Empire. Social and Cultural Aspects of Modernization Processes in Russia'' URSS (2004) p50&lt;/ref&gt; The British Universal Monarchy was “[[Protestant]], commercial, maritime and free”&lt;ref&gt;see Armitage, David ''The Ideological Origins of the British Empire'' Cambridge University Press (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; and was not composed of contiguous territory. It had both similarities and difference with the [[Spanish Empire]]. Whereas [[Catholicism]] provided ideological unity for the Spanish Empire, British Protestant diversity would lead to “disunity rather than unity”.&lt;ref&gt;Armitage, David ''The Ideological Origins of the British Empire'' Cambridge University Press (2000) p66&lt;/ref&gt;  It was only later that [[federalism]] and economic control was seen as a means to provide unity where religious diversity could not, as with the idea of [[Imperial Federation]] as promoted by [[Joseph Chamberlain]].

[[Napoleon]] came close to creating something akin to a Universal Monarchy with his [[continental system]] and [[Napoleonic Code]], but he failed to conquer all of Europe. The last attempt to create a European Universal Monarchy was that attempted by [[Imperial Germany]] in [[World War I]]. If Germany had been victorious, the German Kaiser would have been suzerain over most of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, Fritz. ''Germany's Aims in the First World War''. (1967)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Niall, Ferguson, ''Virtual History: Alternatives and Counterfactuals'' (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia===
{{Expand section|date=March 2010}}
A parallel process occurred in Asia. Whereas in the West the title of Emperor had by the 19th century largely been stripped of religious connotations and had come to be seen purely in political terms, the title in eastern Asia is almost entirely a religious one, commonly stated as "the [[son of heaven]]". Here the title denotes a higher, "heavenly" rule ("celestial empire"), in contrast to kings who rule between heaven and earth, and by extension today to presidents who are mere base earthly rulers. Imperial China was a Universal Monarchy where all other monarchs were regarded as tributary. The concept was taken up by the Mongols,&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, Robert''Storm from the East: from Genghis Khan to Khubilai Khan'' University of California Press (1993)p156&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sicker, Martin ''The Islamic world in ascendancy: from the Arab conquests to the siege of Vienna'' Greenwood Press (2000) p107&lt;/ref&gt; who under [[Genghis Khan]] were able to enforce this concept more widely than China. The Japanese attempt to unify South East Asia in the [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]] under the [[Shōwa emperor]] follows the model set by Imperial Germany and Joseph Chamberlain of imperial rule based on economic union, matched with Japanese religious ideas.

The Hindu/Buddhist concept of the [[Chakravartin]] is a perfect illustration of the ideal of a Universal Monarch.&lt;ref&gt;Bhandarkar, D. R. ''Lectures on the Ancient History of India from 650–325 B.C.'' University of Calcutta (1919) pp85–86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beér, Robert ''The encyclopedia of Tibetan symbols and motifs'' Serindia Publications 2nd Revised edition(2004) pp160–161&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12078">There have been many voting systems used at '''[[Melodifestivalen]]''' over the course of its history. The Swedish broadcasters have experimented with various techniques over the years including splitting the juries by age, regional voting and an "expert" jury. [[Televoting]] was controversially first introduced in [[Melodifestivalen 1993|1993]], as an unannounced experiment. The Swedish telephone network promptly collapsed under the strain of phone calls being made.&lt;ref name=collapse&gt;ESCtoday.com [http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/7428 Melodifestivalen 1990-2000]. Retrieved on 6 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Televoting was permanently reintroduced in 1999, but the regional jury system was retained, and given a 50% weighting in the overall results. In 2011 the regional juries were abolished and their task was given to juries from other countries that participate in the year's [[Eurovision Song Contest]]. 2015 saw the introduction of a mobile app that allowed the public to vote for their favourite entries for free, but only when the songs were being performed. Although used in all semi-finals and the Second Chance round, the app votes were not used in the final due to the system becoming overloaded and ceasing to function about half an hour into the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.svt.se/melodifestivalen/om-appen/om-appen|title=Allt om vår nya app|work=svt.se|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.svt.se/melodifestivalen/utredning-visar-darfor-strulade-appen|title=Utredning visar - därför strulade appen|work=svt.se|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current voting system has been controversial, as it is possible for the song which receives the most votes from the public not to win, as happened in [[Melodifestivalen 2005|2005]], [[Melodifestivalen 2008|2008]], [[Melodifestivalen 2013|2013]] and [[Melodifestivalen 2017|2017]].

The current televoting/appvoting record is 12,634,477 votes in the [[Melodifestivalen 2016]] final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.svt.se/melodifestivalen/alla-rostningssiffror-sa-tog-frans-jeppsson-wall-och-if-i-were-sorry-over-melodifestivalen-2016|title=Se alla röstningssiffror: Så tog Frans över i Melodifestivalen 2016|access-date=2016-03-16|work=svt.se}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From [[Melodifestivalen 1984|1984]] to [[Melodifestivalen 1987|1987]] the juries were sorted by age, not region, but the voting system remained the same. Regional juries returned in [[Melodifestivalen 1988|1988]].

|'''1999–2008'''
|Juries voted as 1997. Televoting points are given by multiplying the juries' points allocations (1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12) by the total number of juries - so with eleven juries, 11, 22, 44, 66, 88, 110 and 132 - to give a 50:50 jury-public points split

|'''2011–2017'''
|Eleven international juries give points as above; televoting now gives respective shares of 473 points (the total of all the juries) based on percentage of total vote, e.g. a song that gets 10% of the televoting would receive 48 points (47.3). In 2018, the format was changed slightly so that more points would be on offer, with 7's, 5's and 3's also included to mirror the voting system of Eurovision proper, and ensure a total of 638 televoting points on offer.

==Records==

In the event of a tie, the song that received more votes from the public receives the higher position.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sr.se/cgi-bin/gavleborg/nyheter/artikel.asp?artikel=575492 Nordman undvek sistaplatsen] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930181519/http://www.sr.se/cgi-bin/gavleborg/nyheter/artikel.asp?artikel=575492 |date=2007-09-30 }} {{sv icon}}. SR.se (13 March 2005). Retrieved on 28 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The closest victories are [[Tommy Körberg]]'s in 1969 and Björn Skifs' in 1978. In 1969, Körberg tied for first place with [[Jan Malmsjö]] before winning after the jury voted for their favourite out of the two. In 1978, Björn Skifs tied for first place with Lasse Holm, Kikki Danielsson and Wizex; but won after each jury was called to vote for their favourite out of the tied songs. Unlike in 1969, each jury ''group'' (rather than individual jury members) counted for one point in the tie-break.

Since the current voting system was introduced, results have been more clear-cut. The televoters and juries agreed on the winner in seven out of nine finals between 1999 and 2007. The closest victory since 1999 is Sanna Nielsen's two-point win in 2014. The biggest victory by straight-points in the history of the event is ABBA's win in 1974 with 302 points. Under the current voting system the record is 288 points, achieved by [[Måns Zelmerlöw]] in 2015 with the song "[[Heroes (Måns Zelmerlöw song)|Heroes]]". The entry also broke the record for the biggest difference between the winning and second placed song, with 149 points between it and [[Jon Henrik Fjällgren]]'s "[[Jag är fri (Manne leam frijje)]]". "Heroes" also garnered the largest amount of both jury and viewer points received by an entry since 1999, gathering 122 points and 166 points, respectively. Two songs have scored top marks from each voting region: Carola Häggkvist in 1983 with "Främling", and Arvingarna in 1993 with "Eloise". However, in 1993, experimental televoting was used and the two are not entirely comparable. The biggest victory in terms of points as a percentage of the total possible score is also held by Carola and "Främling", which defeated Kikki Danielsson's "[[Varför är kärleken röd? (song)|Varför är kärleken röd?]]" by 43 points, 48% of the total potential mark.

==Jury regions==
[[Image:Melodifestivalen juries labelled.png|right|thumb|SVT has eleven news districts,  each of which was represented by a jury in the final of Melodifestivalen from 1974-2009.]]

Until 2010 each jury represented one of SVT news districts. In 2010 six juries were replaced by international juries from different European countries, with the remaining juries coming from Luleå, Umeå, Gothenburg, Malmö and Stockholm. In 2011 the Swedish were all replaced by international juries. In 2013 and 2014, all Big 5 countries cast their votes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2721">The '''Years of Lead''' were a political phenomenon related to the [[Cold War]] that was characterized by [[left-wing terrorism|left-]] and [[right-wing terrorism]] and the putative [[strategy of tension]], beginning in Italy and later spreading to the rest of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/3372239.stm Italy's history of terror]&lt;/ref&gt; In Italy terrorist groups include the [[Red Brigades]] and [[Ordine Nuovo]], in Germany there was the [[Red Army Faction]] and in France there was  ''[[Action directe (armed group)|Action directe]]''. In Belgium, the ''années de plomb'' or "Bloody Eighties", refers to the [[Brabant killers|Brabant massacres]] which resulted in 28 deaths. The far-right movement [[Westland New Post]] (WNP) has been suspected in this campaign. Attacks by the [[Communist Combatant Cells]], a short-lived group, killed two. Many of the right-wing groups involved have been linked to [[Operation Gladio]]. The liberation of [[James L. Dozier]] signaled the end of the Years of Lead.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.it/books?id=XNK4ChtjZ7QC&amp;pg=PT115&amp;lpg=PT115&amp;dq=Liberation+of+Dozler+end+of+years+of+lead&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=dMwWJnsz4M&amp;sig=CWxFj9RoFo9tJZN_Kr1NTBkBv_U&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Ih2LVJ6NLc_katq8grAD&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwBw]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.it/books?id=UMyoAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA58&amp;lpg=PA58&amp;dq=Liberation+of+Dozler+end+of+years+of+lead&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xiTBL3RpNS&amp;sig=xIfElzZAqMMWYoqaAfjRbsH3nes&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Ih2LVJ6NLc_katq8grAD&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAg]&lt;/ref&gt;
