'''''Ancient Aliens''''' is an American television series that premiered on April 20, 2010, on the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History]] channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/shows/ancient-aliens/episodes|title=Ancient Aliens Episode Guide|date=December 25, 2010|publisher=History.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Produced by [[Prometheus Entertainment]] in a documentary style, the program presents hypotheses of [[ancient astronauts]] and proposes that historical texts, archaeology, and legends contain evidence of past human-[[Potential cultural impact of extraterrestrial contact|extraterrestrial contact]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/shows/ancient-aliens/articles/ancient-alien-theory|title=Ancient Aliens Theory|date=December 25, 2010|publisher=History.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/shows/ancient-aliens/articles/evidence-of-ancient-aliens|title=Evidence of Ancient Aliens?|date=December 25, 2010|publisher=History.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show has been widely criticized by [[historians]], [[cosmologists]] and other scientific circles for presenting and promoting [[pseudoscience]] and [[pseudohistory]].

The series started with a [[TV special]] of the same name that aired on March 8, 2009, on the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History]] channel. Seasons 1–3 aired on the same channel until 2011. From season 4 to the middle of season 7, the series aired on [[H2 (TV channel)|H2]]. On April 10, 2015, episode premieres returned to History.

Season 13 premiered on April 27, 2018 with a two-hour special.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.monstersandcritics.com/smallscreen/ancient-aliens-season-13-when-will-show-return|title=Ancient Aliens Season 13: What date will show return in 2018?|first=Julian|last=Cheetle|publisher=Monstersandcritics.com|date=March 30, 2018|accessdate=April 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scott Littleton]] served as an expert consultant for the show until his death in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1556-3502.2011.52231.x|title=Obituary of C. Scott Littleton|work=Anthropology News|date=February 17, 2011|volume=52|number=2|pages=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical reception===
Reviewers have characterized the show as "far-fetched",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph (London)|date=April 30, 2011|page=38|title=Ancient Aliens|author=SH}}&lt;/ref&gt; "hugely speculative",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Times (London)|date=April 30, 2011|first=Joe|last=Clay|title=Digital Choices|page= 35}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "...expound[ing] wildly on theories suggesting that astronauts wandered the Earth freely in ancient times."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Globe and Mail (Canada)|date=April 25, 2011|first=Andrew|last=Ryan|title=Tonight on TV/Critical Picks|page=R2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the ideas presented in the show are not accepted by the scientific community, and have been criticized as [[pseudoscience]] and [[pseudohistory]].&lt;ref name=Fritze&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/hsp/summary/v010/10.5.fritze.html|last=Fritze|first=Ronald H.|title=On the Perils and Pleasures of Confronting Pseudohistory|work=Historically Speaking|volume=10|number=5|date=November 2009|pages=2–5|issn=1941-4188}}&lt;/ref&gt; History professor [[Ronald H. Fritze]] observed that pseudoscience as offered by von Däniken and the ''Ancient Aliens'' program has a periodic popularity in the US: "In a pop culture with a short memory and a voracious appetite, aliens and pyramids and lost civilizations are recycled like fashions."&lt;ref name=Fritze/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rorotoko&gt;{{cite web|last=Fritze|first=Ronald|title=Ronald H.

[[Forbes.com]] contributor Brad Lockwood criticized ''Ancient Aliens'' as an example of the History Channel's addition of "programs devoted to monsters, aliens, and conspiracies", commenting that, "''Ancient Aliens'' defies all ability to suspend disbelief for the sake of entertainment."&lt;ref name=Forbes&gt;{{cite news|last=Lockwood|first=Brad|title=High Ratings Aside, Where's the History on History?|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradlockwood/2011/10/17/high-ratings-aside-wheres-the-history-on-history/|work=October 17, 2011|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=March 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forbes.com staff writer Alex Knapp also criticized the series and cited [[archaeologist]] Keith Fitzpatrick-Matthews' rebuke of the History Channel for "treating (''Ancient Aliens'') nonsense as though it were fact."&lt;ref name=Forbes2&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexknapp/2011/09/19/an-archaeologist-watches-the-history-channel-and-questions-the-part-about-the-aliens|title=An Archaeologist Watches the History Channel and Questions the Part About the Aliens|last1=Knapp|first1=Alex|date=September 19, 2011|work=Tech|publisher=Forbes.com|accessdate=February 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Smithsonian.com]] science writer Brian Switek was extremely critical of the series, particularly an episode that suggested "aliens exterminated dinosaurs to make way for our species." He characterized the show as "some of the most noxious sludge in television’s bottomless chum bucket." Switek wrote that the show employs the [[Gish gallop]] technique to overwhelm the viewer with many "fictions and distortions".&lt;ref name=Switek&gt;{{cite web|last=Switek|first=Brian|title=The Idiocy, Fabrications and Lies of Ancient Aliens|url=http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/dinosaur/2012/05/the-idiocy-fabrications-and-lies-of-ancient-aliens|work=May 11, 2012|publisher=Smithsonian.com|accessdate=July 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have called attention to a paucity of opposing viewpoints.  [[Kenneth Feder]], Professor of Archaeology at [[Central Connecticut State University]] and author of ''Frauds, Myths, and Mysteries: Science and Pseudoscience in Archaeology'',&lt;ref&gt;Feder, K. (1990). ''Frauds, Myths, and Mysteries: Science and Pseudoscience in Archaeology''.  New York, McGraw-Hill Humanities/Social Sciences/Languages. {{ISBN|978-0078116971}}.&lt;/ref&gt; has said that he was approached by ''Ancient Aliens'' producers regarding his potential participation.  "My response was, I’d be happy to be on your show, but you should know that I think that the ancient astronaut hypothesis is execrable bullshit," he said, in an interview.  "I haven’t heard back from them, rather remarkably. So, I guess maybe they’re not interested in the other point of view."&lt;ref&gt;Ancient Alien Astronauts: Interview with Ken Feder.

===Appearances in popular culture===
''[[South Park]]'' parodied the show in an episode entitled "[[A History Channel Thanksgiving]]" (November 11, 2011, episode 15.13).  Reviewer Ramsey Isler commented, "The aim is placed squarely on ''Ancient Aliens'' specifically," and described the animation as "a perfect satire of all the ridiculousness of this series, including the black and white art with aliens photoshopped in, and interviews with people of dubious authority."&lt;ref name=IGN&gt;{{cite web|last=Isler|first=Ramsey|title=South Park: "A History Channel Thanksgiving" Review|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/121/1212124p1.html|work=IGN Television Reviews|publisher=IGN Entertainment|accessdate=November 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Viceland]] premiered ''[[Traveling the Stars: Action Bronson and Friends Watch ‘Ancient Aliens’]]'' (also known as ''Action Bronson Watches Ancient Aliens'') with a special on April 20, 2016 followed by a ten-episode series beginning in July. The series features rapper [[Action Bronson]], who praises ''Ancient Aliens'' as "the best thing that was ever created by man," commenting over the History series while smoking [[cannabis]] with celebrity guests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.craveonline.com/music/1012299-action-bronson-ancient-aliens |title=Action Bronson’s New Show Is High-larious |last=Green |first=Patrick |date=July 21, 2016 |website=CraveOnline |access-date=September 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to producers Jordan Kinley and Hannah Gregg, the show was conceived as a way to address disgruntled viewers of H2, the network that formerly aired ''Ancient Aliens'' before being replaced by Viceland on cable carriers in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thecreatorsproject.vice.com/blog/traveling-stars-action-bronson-friends-ancient-aliens-interview |title=How Action Bronson Ended Up Getting High and Watching 'Ancient Aliens' |last=Capossela |first=Francesca |date=August 3, 2016 |website=Vice |access-date=September 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Annals of Philosophy''''' was a [[learned journal]] founded in 1813 by the Scottish chemist [[Thomas Thomson (chemist)|Thomas Thomson]]. It shortly became a leader in its field of commercial scientific periodicals.{{sfn|Morrell|2004}} Contributors included &lt;!--[[Friedrich Christian Accum]], --&gt;[[John George Children]],{{sfn|Bettany|1887}} [[Edward Daniel Clarke]],{{sfn|Wroth|1887}}  &lt;!--[[William Daniel Conybeare]], --&gt;[[Sir Philip Crampton, 1st Baronet|Philip Crampton]],{{sfn|Thomson|loc=Vol I, p 170}}{{sfn|Bettany|1888}} [[Alexander Crichton]],{{sfn|Boase|1888}}  [[James Cumming (chemist)|James Cumming]],{{sfn|Bettany|1888a}} &lt;!--[[Michael Faraday]], --&gt;[[John Herapath]],{{sfn|Goodwin|1891}}  [[William George Horner]],{{sfn|Thomson|loc=Vol VI, pp 281 – 283}} &lt;!--[[Agnes Ibbetson]], --&gt;[[Thomas Dick Lauder]],{{sfn|Henderson|1892}}  [[John Miers (botanist)|John Miers]],{{sfn|Boulger|1894}} [[Matthew Paul Moyle]],{{sfn|Boase|1894}} [[Robert Porrett]],{{sfn|Hartog|1896}}  [[James Thomson (minister)|James Thomson]],{{sfn|Carlyle|1898}} and [[Charles Wheatstone]].{{sfn|Thompson|1899}}

Thomson edited it until 1821, when he was succeeded in 1821 by [[Richard Phillips (chemist)|Richard Phillips]]. The journal was bought by [[Richard Taylor (editor)|Richard Taylor]] in 1827, and closed down for the benefit of the ''[[Philosophical Magazine]]''.{{sfn|Harden|1898}}

The ''Annals of Philosophy'' were issued monthly following a standard pattern. Often the first article was a biographical article (10 pages) on a living or recently deceased scientist. This was then followed by a series of extended pieces (5-10 pages) on particular topics, sometimes by eminent authors. Then there were shorter news items and correspondence. Summaries followed: first of the proceedings of learned bodies (Royal Society, Linnean, French Institute -if available: the [[Napoleonic Wars]] made communications with the continent difficult at first,{{sfn|Thomson|loc=Vol III, pp iii – iv}} etc.), then of patents, and finally of new books. The last section was a [[meteorological]] journal. Every six months a title page, index, and preface were issued which could be bound before the six monthly issues to make a half-yearly volume.{{sfn|Thomson|loc=Vol I, p iii}}  Including front matter, volumes were just under 500 pages each.{{sfn|Thomson|loc=Vol I, pp v–viii}}{{sfn|Thomson|loc=Vol II, pp iv – viii}}{{sfn|Thomson|loc=Vol III, pp v – viii}}{{sfn|Thomson|loc=Vol IV, pp v – viii}}{{sfn|Thomson|loc=Vol V, pp vi – viii}}{{sfn|Thomson|loc=Vol VI, pp iii – vii}}{{sfn|Thomson|loc=Vol VII, pp iii – vii}}{{sfn|Thomson|loc=Vol VIII, pp iii – vii}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="57124">'''Antiquarian science books''' are original historical works (e.g., books or technical papers)  concerning [[List of important publications in science|science]], [[List of important publications in mathematics|mathematics]] and sometimes [[engineering]]. 
These books are important primary references for the study of the [[history of science and technology]], they can provide valuable insights into the historical development of the various fields of scientific inquiry ([[History of science]], [[History of mathematics]], etc.)

The landmark  are significant first (or early) editions typically worth hundreds or thousands of dollars (prices may vary widely based on condition, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Prices quoted were collected using sources such as {{cite web|url=https://ilab.org/buy_books |title=International League of Antiquarian Booksellers |accessdate=2018-06-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509062742/http://www.ilab.org/services/searchform.php |archivedate=2008-05-09 }}  {{cite web|url=https://www.abaa.org/ |title=ABAA |accessdate=2018-06-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090701041121/http://search.abaa.org/dbp2/searchform.php |archivedate=2009-07-01 }} http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchEntry http://www.sothebys.com http://www.christies.com&lt;/ref&gt; 
Reprints of these books are often available, for example from [[Great Books of the Western World]], [[Dover Publications]] or [[Google Book Search|Google Books]].

[[Incunabula]] are extremely rare and valuable, but as the "[[scientific revolution]]" is only taken to have started around the 1540s, such works of [[Renaissance literature]] (including [[alchemy]], [[Renaissance magic]], etc.) are not usually included under the notion of "scientific" literature. Printed originals of the beginning scientific revolution thus date to the 1540s or later, notably beginning with the original publication of [[Copernican heliocentrism]]. [[Nicolaus Copernicus]]'  ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'' of 1543 sold for more than US$2 million at auctions.&lt;ref&gt;US$2,210,500 at a [http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/books-manuscripts/copernicus-nicolaus-de-revolutionibus-orbium-coelestium-5084091-details.aspx Christies] auction in 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- for an item to be listed here, it should either have a dedicated Wikipedia article already, or there should be a citation confirming that the book is either widely considered a "milestone" or something, or that the book has been sold for a huge sum at some auction, etc.

==Summary==
In this book, Orrell explains the science of prediction to a general audience.&lt;ref name="foresight"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fields |first=Paul |date=2008 |title= The Future of Everything: The Science of Prediction |url= https://forecasters.org/pdfs/foresight/free/Issue10_Fields.pdf |journal= Foresight: The International Journal of Applied Forecasting |volume=2008|issue=10|pages=5–7 |access-date=24 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book begins with a general history of prediction from the [[Delphic oracle]] to the present day. The next part considers three different areas of prediction in detail: weather, health and economics. It argues that these are all examples of [[complex systems]] that cannot be reduced to equations. As [[mathematical models]] become more refined, the number of unknown [[parameters]] tends to explode. At the same time, networks of interlocking [[feedback]] loops make the models unstable. According to Orrell, the resulting model error (rather than e.g. the [[butterfly effect]]) is the main reason why forecasts go wrong.&lt;ref name="ecologicalcomplexity"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bell |first=Andrew |date=2008 |title= The Future of Everything: The Science of Prediction |journal= Ecological Complexity |volume=5|issue=1|pages=69–70 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the final part, the book turns to predictions for the future, including the long-term effects of [[climate change]]. It concludes with some thoughts for the future, as well as a reminder that all such forecasts are unreliable.

The title of the book is a reference to a mythical arrow that once belonged to the god [[Apollo]]. According to legend, the arrow was gifted by a priest to [[Pythagoras]], allowing him to dart through space and time.&lt;ref name="apolloref"&gt;{{cite book |last=Orrell |first=David |date=2007 |title=Apollo’s Arrow: The Science of Prediction and the Future of Everything |publisher=HarperCollins |page=24 |isbn=978-0002007405}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Aryan race''' is a [[Race (human classification)|racial grouping]] that emerged in the period of the late 19th century and mid-20th century to describe people of [[Indo-European]] heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mid-day.com/articles/devdutt-pattanaik-leveraging-the-aryans/17076154|title=Devdutt Pattanaik: Leveraging the Aryans}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It derives from the idea that the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|original speakers of the Indo-European languages]] and their descendants up to the present day constitute a distinctive [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] or subrace of the [[Caucasian race]].&lt;ref&gt;Mish, Frederic C., Editor in Chief ''Webster's Tenth New Collegiate Dictionary'' Springfield, Massachusetts, U.S.A.:1994--Merriam-Webster See original definition (definition #1) of "Aryan" in English--Page 66&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
{{Main|Aryan}}
[[Image:Darius I the Great's inscription.jpg|thumb|left|267px|The earliest epigraphically attested reference to the word "Aryan" occurs in the 6th-century BC [[Behistun inscription]], which describes itself to have been composed "in Aryan (''arya'') [language or script]" (§ 70). The "Aryan" in this context means "[[Iranian languages|Iranian]]".&lt;ref&gt;''cf.'' {{Cite book|last=Gershevitch|first=Ilya|chapter=Old Iranian Literature|title=Handbuch der Orientalistik, Literatur I|year=1968|location=Leiden|publisher=Brill|pages=1–31|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Aria Waldseemuller 1507.png|200px|thumb|267px|left|The region ''[[Aria (satrapy)|Aria]]'' as depicted by [[Waldseemuller]] in 1507]]

The term ''Aryan'' has generally been used to describe the [[Proto-Indo-Iranian language]] root *arya which was the ethnonym the [[Indo-Iranians]] adopted to describe Aryans. Its cognate in [[Sanskrit]] is the word ''[[ārya]]'' ([[Devanāgarī]]: [[आर्य]]), in origin an ethnic self-designation, in Classical Sanskrit meaning "honourable, respectable, noble".&lt;ref&gt;[[Monier-Williams]] (1899).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Monier Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary (2008 revision)|publisher=UNIVERSITÄT ZU KÖLN |url=http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/monier/|accessdate=July 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Old Persian]] cognate ''ariya-'' ([[Old Persian cuneiform]]: 𐎠𐎼𐎡𐎹) is the ancestor of the modern name of [[Iran]] and [[ethnonym]] for the [[Iranian people]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/arya-an-ethnic-epithet |title=Arya |last=Bailey |first=H.W. |website=Encyclopædia Iranica |access-date=April 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th century, the most ancient known [[Indo-European languages]] were those of the ancient Indo-Iranians. The word ''Aryan'' was therefore adopted to refer not only to the [[Indo-Iranian peoples]], but also to native Indo-European speakers as a whole, including the&lt;!--DO NOT ADD OR REMOVE FROM THIS LIST WITHOUT CITATIONS--&gt; [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Greek language|Greeks]], and the [[Germanic languages|Germans]]. It was soon recognised that [[Baltic languages|Balts]], [[Celtic languages|Celts]], and [[Slavic languages|Slavs]] also belonged to the same group. It was argued that all of these languages originated from a common root – now known as [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] – spoken by an ancient people who were thought of as ancestors of the [[Europe]]an, [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]], and [[Indo-Aryans|Indo-Aryan]] peoples.

This usage was common among knowledgeable authors writing in the late 19th and early 20th century. An example of this usage appears in ''[[The Outline of History]]'', a bestselling 1920 work by [[H. G. Wells]].&lt;ref&gt;Wells, H.G. ''[[The Outline of History]]'', 3rd ed. (New York: Macmillan, 1921), Ch. 20 ("The Aryan-Speaking Peoples in Prehistoric Times"), pp. 236-51.&lt;/ref&gt; In that influential volume, Wells used the term in the plural ("the Aryan peoples"), but he was a staunch opponent of the racist and politically motivated exploitation of the singular term ("the Aryan people") by earlier authors like [[Houston Stewart Chamberlain]] (see below) and was careful either to avoid the generic singular, though he did refer now and again in the singular to some specific "Aryan people" (e.g., the [[Scythians]]). In 1922, in ''[[A Short History of the World (H.G. Wells)|A Short History of the World]]'', Wells depicted a highly diverse group of various "Aryan peoples" learning "methods of civilization" and then, by means of different uncoordinated movements that Wells believed were part of a larger dialectical rhythm of conflict between settled civilizations and nomadic invaders that also encompassed Aegean and Mongol peoples ''inter alia'', "subjugat[ing]" – "in form" but not in "ideas and methods" – "the whole ancient world, Semitic, Aegean and Egyptian alike".&lt;ref name="bartleby"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/86/19.html |title= H.G. Wells in 1922 on the early history of "the Aryan peoples" (Proto-Indo Europeans) |publisher=bartleby.com|accessdate=August 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in a climate of burgeoning racism it proved difficult to maintain such nuanced distinctions. Even [[Max Mueller]], a linguist who wrote in 1888 that "an ethnologist who speaks of Aryan race, Aryan blood, Aryan eyes and hair, is as great a sinner as a linguist who speaks of a dolichocephalic dictionary or a brachycephalic grammar",&lt;ref&gt;F. Max Müller, ''Biographies of Words and the Home of the Aryas'' (1888), Kessinger Publishing reprint, 2004, p. 120; Dorothy Matilda Figueira, ''Aryans, Jews, Brahmins: Theorizing Authority Through Myths of Identity'' (SUNY Press, 2002), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; was on occasion guilty of using the term "Aryan race".&lt;ref&gt;[[Romila Thapar]], "The Theory of Aryan Race and India: History and Politics," ''Social Scientist'' 24.1/3 (Jan.–Mar. 1996), 6. Thapar cites an 1883 lecture in which Mueller spoke of someone as "belonging to the south-eastern branch of the Aryan race."&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1944 edition of [[Rand McNally]]'s ''World Atlas'', the Aryan race is depicted as one of the ten major racial groupings of mankind.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rand McNally]] (1944) "Races of Mankind" (map)''Rand McNally's World Atlas International Edition'' Chicago: Rand McNally.   pp.278–79 – In the explanatory section below the map, the Aryan race (the word "Aryan" being defined in the description below the map as a synonym for "Indo-Europeans") is described as being one of the ten major racial groupings of mankind. Each of the ten racial groupings is depicted in a different [[color]] on the map and the estimated populations in 1944 of the larger racial groups except the Dravidians are given (the Dravidian population in 1944 would have been about 70,000,000). The other nine groups are depicted as being the [[Semitic people|Semitic race]] (the Aryans (850,000,000) and the Semites (70,000,000) are described as being the two main branches of the [[Caucasian race]]), the [[Dravidian race]], the [[Mongoloid race|Mongolian race]] (700,000,000), the [[Malayan race]] (Correct population given on page 413 – 64,000,000 including besides the populations of the Dutch East Indies, the Philippines, and Madagascar also half of the Malay States, Micronesia, and Polynesia), the [[Indigenous people of the Americas|American Indian race]] (10,000,000), the [[Black people|Negro race]] (140,000,000), the [[Australoid race|Native Australians]], the [[Australoid race|Papuans]], and the [[Capoid race|Hottentots and Bushmen]].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[science fiction]] author [[Poul Anderson]], an [[Anti-racism|anti-racist]] [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] of [[Scandinavia]]n ancestry, in his many works, consistently used the term ''Aryan'' as a synonym for "Indo-Europeans".&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the Poul Anderson short stories in the 1964 collection ''[[Time and Stars]]'' and the ''Polesotechnic League'' stories featuring [[Nicholas van Rijn]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of "Aryan" as a synonym for Indo -European may occasionally appear in material that is based on historic scholarship. Thus, a 1989 article in ''[[Scientific American]]'', [[Colin Renfrew]] uses the term "Aryan" as a synonym for "Indo-European".&lt;ref&gt;Renfrew, Colin. (1989). The Origins of Indo-European Languages. /Scientific American/, 261(4), 82-90.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] is still commonly used to describe the Indic half of the [[Indo-Iranian languages]], i.e., the family that includes [[Sanskrit]] and modern languages such as [[Hindi]]-[[Urdu]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], [[Romani language|Romani]], [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]], [[Sinhalese language|Sinhalese]] and [[Marathi language|Marathi]].&lt;ref&gt;Fortson, Benjamin W. ''Indo-European Language and Culture: An Introduction''. 2nd ed., Wiley-Blackwell, 2010, paras. 10.28 and 10.58.&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear left}}

{{See also|Scientific racism}}

In the context of 19th-century [[physical anthropology]] and [[scientific racism]], the term "Aryan race" has been misapplied to all people descended from the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans]] – a subgroup of the [[Europid]]or "[[Caucasian race|Caucasian]]" race,&lt;ref&gt;Mish, Frederic C., Editor in Chief ''Webster's Tenth New Collegiate Dictionary'' Springfield, Massachusetts, U.S.A.:1994--Merriam-Webster Page 66&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Pomeroy Widney|Widney, Joseph P]] ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=s9UKAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage Race Life of the Aryan Peoples]'' New York: Funk &amp; Wagnalls. 1907 In Two Volumes: Volume One--''The Old World'' Volume Two--''The New World'' ISBN B000859S6O&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to the Indo-Iranians (who are the only people known to have used ''Arya'' as an [[endonym]] in ancient times). This usage was considered to include most modern inhabitants of [[Australasia]], the [[Caucasus]], [[Central Asia]], [[Europe]], [[Latin America]], [[North America]], [[Siberia]], [[South Asia]], [[Southern Africa]], and [[West Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;''Rand McNally’s World Atlas International Edition'' Chicago:1944 Rand McNally  Map: "Races of Mankind" pp. 278–279.&lt;/ref&gt;  Such claims became increasingly common during the early 19th century, when it was commonly believed that the Aryans originated in the south-west [[Eurasian steppe]]s (present-day [[Russia]] and [[Ukraine]]).

[[Max Müller]] is often identified as the first writer to mention an "Aryan race" in English. In his ''Lectures on the Science of Language'' (1861),&lt;ref name=Orsucci/&gt; Muller referred to Aryans as a "race of people". At the time, the term race had the meaning of "a group of tribes or peoples, an ethnic group".&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]] under race, ''n.''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; I.1.c has "A group of several tribes or peoples, regarded as forming a distinct ethnic set. Esp. used in 19th-cent. anthropological classification, sometimes in conjunction with linguistic groupings."&lt;/ref&gt; Müller's concept of Aryan was later construed to imply a biologically distinct sub-group of humanity, by writers such as [[Arthur de Gobineau]], who argued that the Aryans represented a superior branch of humanity. Müller objected to the mixing of linguistics and anthropology. "The Science of Language and the Science of Man cannot be kept too much asunder&amp;nbsp;... I must repeat what I have said many times before, it would be wrong to speak of Aryan blood as of dolichocephalic grammar".&lt;ref&gt;Speech before the University of Stassbourg, 1872, Chaudhuri, Nirad, ''Scholar Extraordinary: The Life of Professor the Rt. Hon. Freidrich Max Muller'', Chatto and Windus, 1974, p.313&lt;/ref&gt; He restated his opposition to this method in 1888 in his essay ''Biographies of words and the home of the Aryas''.&lt;ref name=Orsucci&gt;Andrea Orsucci, "[http://www.unifi.it/riviste/cromohs/3_98/orsucci.html Ariani, indogermani, stirpi mediterranee: aspetti del dibattito sulle razze europee (1870-1914)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020310125529/http://www.unifi.it/riviste/cromohs/3_98/orsucci.html |date=2002-03-10 }}", in ''[[Cromohs]]'', 1998 {{it icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Arthur de Gobineau.jpg|thumb|left|[[Arthur de Gobineau]], one of the key formulators of the theory of the "Aryan race"]]
By the late 19th century the steppe theory of Indo-European origins was challenged by a view that the Indo-Europeans originated in ancient Germany or [[Scandinavia]] – or at least that in those countries the original Indo-European ethnicity had been preserved. The word Aryan was consequently used even more restrictively – and even less in keeping with its Indo-Iranian origins – to mean "[[Germanic people|Germanic]]", "Nordic" or [[Northern Europe]]ans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vacher de Lapouge (trans Clossen, C)|first=Georges|year=1899|title=Old and New Aspects of the Aryan Question|journal=The American Journal of Sociology|volume=5|issue=3|pages=329–346|doi=10.1086/210895}}&lt;/ref&gt; This implied division of Caucasoids into Aryans, [[Semites]] and [[Hamites]] was also based on linguistics, rather than based on physical anthropology; it paralleled an archaic tripartite division in anthropology between "[[Nordic race|Nordic]]", "[[Alpine race|Alpine]]" and "[[Mediterranean race|Mediterranean]]" races.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

A number of later writers, such as the French anthropologist [[Vacher de Lapouge]] in his book ''L'Aryen'', argued that this superior branch could be identified biologically by using the [[cephalic index]] (a measure of head shape) and other indicators. He argued that the long-headed "[[Dolichocephaly|dolichocephalic]]-blond" Europeans, characteristically found in northern Europe, were natural leaders, destined to rule over more "[[Brachycephaly|brachiocephalic]]" (short headed) peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1086/210895|last=Vacher de Lapouge (trans Clossen, C)|first=Georges |title=Old and New Aspects of the Aryan Question|journal=The American Journal of Sociology|volume= 5| issue = 3|pages=329–346|year=1899}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The German origin of the Aryans was especially promoted by the archaeologist [[Gustaf Kossinna]], who claimed that the Proto-Indo-European peoples were identical to the [[Corded Ware culture]] of Neolithic Germany. This idea was widely circulated in both intellectual and popular culture by the early twentieth century,&lt;ref&gt;Arvidsson, Stefan (2006). Aryan Idols. USA: University of Chicago Press, 143. {{ISBN|0-226-02860-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and is reflected in the concept of "[[Corded-Nordics]]" in [[Carleton S. Coon]]'s 1939 ''[[The Races of Europe (1939 book)|The Races of Europe]]''.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Other anthropologists contested such claims. In Germany, [[Rudolf Virchow]] launched a study of [[craniometry]], which prompted him to denounce "Nordic mysticism" in the 1885 Anthropology Congress in [[Karlsruhe]], while [[Josef Kollmann]]&lt;!-- see [[:de:Josef Kollmann]] --&gt;, a collaborator of Virchow, stated in the same congress that the people of Europe, be they English, German, French, and Spaniard belonged to a "mixture of various races," furthermore declaring that the "results of craniology...[are] against any theory concerning the superiority of this or that European race" to others.&lt;ref name=Orsucci/&gt;

Virchow's contribution to the debate sparked a controversy. [[Houston Stewart Chamberlain]], a strong supporter of the theory of a superior Aryan race or Germanic race, attacked Josef Kollmann arguments in detail. While the "Aryan race" theory remained popular, particularly in Germany, some authors defended Virchow's perspective, in particular [[Otto Schrader (philologist)|Otto Schrader]], [[Rudolph von Jhering]] and the ethnologist [[Robert Hartmann (naturalist)|Robert Hartmann]] (1831–1893), who proposed to ban the notion of "Aryan" from anthropology.&lt;ref name=Orsucci/&gt;

{{Main|Root race}}

The [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophical]] movement, founded by [[Madame Blavatsky|Helena Blavatsky]] and [[Henry Steel Olcott|Henry Olcott]] at the end of the nineteenth century, took inspiration from Indian culture, in this case, perhaps, from the Hindu reform movement the [[Arya Samaj]] founded by [[Dayananda Saraswati|Swami Dayananda]].
Blavatsky argued that humanity had descended from a series of "root races", naming the fifth root race (out of seven) the Aryan race. She thought that the Aryans originally [[The Secret Doctrine#Volume two|came from]] [[Atlantis]] and described the Aryan races with the following words:

{{quote|The Aryan races, for instance, now varying from dark brown, almost black, red-brown-yellow, down to the whitest creamy colour, are yet all of one and the same stock – the Fifth Root-Race – and spring from one single progenitor, ... who is said to have lived over 18,000,000 years ago, and also 850,000 years ago – at the time of the sinking of the last remnants of the great continent of [[Atlantis]].&lt;ref&gt;Blavatsky, [[The Secret Doctrine|The Secret Doctrine, the Synthesis of Science, Religion and Philosophy]], Vol. II, p.249&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Blavatsky used "Root Race" as a technical term to describe human evolution over the large [[time]] periods in her [[cosmology]]. However, she also claimed that there were modern non-Aryan peoples who were inferior to Aryans. She regularly contrasts "Aryan" with "[[Semitic people|Semitic]]" culture, to the detriment of the latter, asserting that Semitic peoples are an offshoot of Aryans who have become "degenerate in spirituality and perfected in materiality."&lt;ref&gt;Blavatsky, ''The Secret Doctrine'', Vol II, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; She also states that some peoples are "semi-animal creatures". These latter include "the Tasmanians, a portion of the Australians and a mountain tribe in China". There are also "considerable numbers of the mixed Lemuro-Atlantean peoples produced by various crossings with such semi-human stocks – e.g., the wild men of Borneo, the Veddhas of Ceylon, most of the remaining Australians, Bushmen, Negritos, Andaman Islanders, etc."&lt;ref&gt;Blavatsky, ''The Secret Doctrine'', Vol II, pp. 195-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this, Blavatsky's admirers claim that her thinking was not connected to fascist or racialist ideas, asserting that she believed in a [[Universal Brotherhood]] of humanity and wrote that "all men have spiritually and physically the same origin" and that "mankind is essentially of one and the same essence".&lt;ref&gt;''The Key to Theosophy'', Section 3&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, in ''The Secret Doctrine'', Blavatsky states: "Verily mankind is 'of one blood,' but not of the same essence."

Blavatsky connects physical race with spiritual attributes constantly throughout her works:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The intellectual difference between the Aryan and other civilized nations and such savages as the [[South Sea Islanders]], is inexplicable on any other grounds. No amount of culture, nor generations of training amid civilization, could raise such human specimens as the [[San people|Bushmen]], the [[Veddhas]] of [[Ceylon]], and some [[African Tribes|African tribes]], to the same intellectual level as the Aryans, the [[Semitic people|Semites]], and the [[Turanian]]s so called. The 'sacred spark' is missing in them and it is they who are the only inferior races on the globe, now happily – owing to the wise adjustment of nature which ever works in that direction – fast dying out. Verily mankind is 'of one blood,' but not of the same essence. We are the hot-house, artificially quickened plants in nature, having in us a spark, which in them is latent."&lt;ref&gt;Blavatsky, ''The Secret Doctrine'', Vol II, p 421&lt;/ref&gt; ... Esoteric history teaches that idols and their worship died out with the Fourth Race, until the survivors of the hybrid races of the latter (Chinamen, African Negroes, &amp;c.) gradually brought the worship back. The Vedas countenance no idols; all the modern Hindu writings do.&lt;ref&gt;Blavatsky, ''The Secret Doctrine'', Vol. II, p.723&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Blavatsky, "the MONADS of the lowest specimens of humanity (the "narrow-brained" savage South-Sea Islander, the African, the Australian) had no Karma to work out when first born as men, as their more favoured brethren in intelligence had".&lt;ref&gt;Blavatsky, ''The Secret Doctrine'', Vol II, p.168&lt;/ref&gt;

She also prophesies of the destruction of the racial "failures of nature" as the future "higher race" ascends:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Thus will mankind, race after race, perform its appointed cycle-pilgrimage. Climates will, and have already begun, to change, each tropical year after the other dropping one sub-race, but only to beget another higher race on the ascending cycle; while a series of other less favoured groups – the failures of nature – will, like some individual men, vanish from the human family without even leaving a trace behind.&lt;ref&gt;Blavatsky, ''The Secret Doctrine'', Vol II, p.446&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The second subrace of the Fifth or Aryan root race, the Arabian, is regarded by Theosophists as one of the Aryan subraces. It is believed by Theosophists that the Arabians, although asserted in traditional Theosophy to be of Aryan (i.e., Indo-European) ancestry, adopted the [[Semitic language]] of the people around them who had migrated earlier from Atlantis (the fifth or (original) Semite subrace of the Atlantean root race). Theosophists assert that the [[Jews]] originated as an offshoot of the Arabian subrace in what is now [[Yemen]] about 30,000&amp;nbsp;BC. They migrated first to [[Somalia]] and then later to [[Egypt]], where they lived until the time of [[Moses]]. Thus, according to the teachings of Theosophy, the Jews are part of the Aryan race.&lt;ref&gt;Powell, A.E.

{{Main|Ariosophy}}

[[Guido von List]] (and his followers such as [[Lanz von Liebenfels]]) later took up some of Blavatsky's ideas, mixing her ideology with nationalistic and fascist ideas; this system of thought became known as [[Ariosophy]]. It was believed in Ariosophy that the [[Germanic languages|Teutonic]]s were superior to all other peoples because according to Theosophy the Teutonics or Nordics were the most recent subrace of the Aryan root race to have evolved.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke, Nicholas ''The Occult Roots of Nazism: Secret Aryan Cults and Their Influence on Nazi Ideology'' New York:1992 New York University Press Chapter 13 "Herbert Reichstein and Ariosophy" Pages 164-176&lt;/ref&gt; Such views also fed into the development of Nazi ideology. Theosophical publications such as ''[[The Aryan Path]]'' were strongly opposed to the Nazi usage, attacking [[Racism|racialism]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

{{Further|Nazism and race}}

The ideology of [[Nazism]] was based upon the conception of the ancient Aryan race being a [[master race|superior race]], holding the highest position in the [[racial hierarchy]] and that the [[Germanic peoples]] were the most racially pure existing peoples of Aryan stock.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=30}} The Nazi conception of the Aryan race arose from earlier proponents of a supremacist conception of the race as described by racial theorist figures such as [[Arthur de Gobineau]] and [[Houston Stewart Chamberlain]].{{sfn|Yenne|2010|pp=21–22}}

Nazi racial theorist [[Hans F. K. Günther]] identified the European race as having five subtype races: [[Nordic race|Nordic]], [[Mediterranean race|Mediterranean]], [[Dinaric race|Dinaric]], [[Alpine race|Alpine]], and [[East Baltic race|East Baltic]].&lt;ref name="Bruce David Baum 2006.

P. 156"/&gt; In his book ''[[Rassenkunde des deutschen Volkes]]'' (1922) ("Racial Science of the German People"), Günther recognized Germans as being composed of all five European subtypes, but emphasized the strong Nordic heritage amongst Germans.&lt;ref name=Maxwell150 &gt;Anne Maxwell.

Hund 2011 page 19&lt;/ref&gt; He defined each racial subtype according to general physical appearance and their psychological qualities including their "racial soul" - referring to their emotional traits and religious beliefs, and provided detailed information on their hair, eye, and skin colours, facial structure.&lt;ref name=Maxwell150 /&gt; He provided photographs of Germans identified as Nordic in places like [[Baden]], [[Stuttgart]], [[Salzburg]], and [[Schwaben]]; and provided photographs of Germans he identified as Alpine and Mediterranean types, especially in [[Vorarlberg]], [[Bavaria]], and the Black Forest region of [[Baden]].&lt;ref name=Maxwell150 /&gt; [[Adolf Hitler]] read ''Rassenkunde des deutschen Volkes,'' which influenced his racial policy and resulted in Günther's Nazi-backed attainment of a position in the anthropology department at the [[University of Jena]] in 1932 where Hitler attended Günther's inaugural lecture.&lt;ref&gt;John Cornwell.

Günther distinguished Aryans from Jews, and identified Jews as descending from non-European races, particularly from what he classified as the Near Asian race (''Vorderasiatische'') more commonly known as the [[Armenoid race]], and said that such origins rendered Jews fundamentally different from and incompatible with Germans and most Europeans.&lt;ref name="Alan E Steinweis 2008. P. 28"&gt;Alan E Steinweis. ''Studying the Jew: Scholarly Antisemitism in Nazi Germany''. Harvard University Press, 2008.

Jews &amp; Race: Writings on Identity &amp; Difference, 1880–1940. Lebanon, New Hampshire, USA: Brandeis University Press, 2011. P. 247.&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed that the Near Eastern race descended from the [[Caucasus]] in the fifth and fourth millennia BC, and that it had expanded into [[Asia Minor]] and [[Mesopotamia]] and eventually to the west coast of the Eastern Mediterranean Sea.&lt;ref name="Alan E Steinweis 2008. P. 28"/&gt; Aside from ascribing Armenians and Jews as having Near Eastern characteristics, he ascribed them to several other contemporary peoples, including: [[Greeks]], [[Turkish people|Turks]], [[Syrians]], and [[Iranian peoples|Iranians]].&lt;ref&gt;Alan E Steinweis. ''Studying the Jew: Scholarly Antisemitism in Nazi Germany''. Harvard University Press, 2008. P. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; In his work ''Racial Characteristics of the Jewish People'', he defined the racial soul of the Near Eastern race as emphasizing a "commercial spirit" (''Handelgeist''), and described them as "artful traders" - a term that Gunther ascribed as being used by Jewish racial theorist Samuel Weissenberg to describe contemporary Armenians, Greeks, and Jews.&lt;ref name="Alan E Steinweis 2008. P. 28"/&gt; Günther added to that description of the Near Eastern type as being composed primarily of commercially spirited and artful traders, by claiming that the type held strong [[psychological manipulation]] skills that aided them in trade.&lt;ref name="Alan E Steinweis 2008. P. 28"/&gt; He claimed that the Near Eastern race had been "bred not so much for the conquest and exploitation of nature as it was for the conquest and exploitation of people".&lt;ref name="Alan E Steinweis 2008. P. 28"/&gt;

Hitler's conception of the Aryan ''[[Herrenvolk]]'' ("master race") explicitly excluded the vast majority of [[Slavs]], regarding the Slavs as having dangerous Jewish and Asiatic influences.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=241}}&lt;ref&gt;André Mineau.

London, England, UK: Routledge, 2006.

Pp. 167, 209"/&gt;

Shortly after the Nazis came to power in 1933 they passed the [[Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service]] law which required all civil servants to provide proof of their Aryan ancestry and defined "non-Aryan" as a person with one Jewish grandparent.&lt;ref name="Ehrenreich p.10"&gt;Ehrenreich, The Nazi ancestral proof, p.10&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933, the German Interior Ministry official Albert Gorter drafted an official definition of the "Aryan race" for the new law which included all non-Jewish Europeans, this definition was unacceptable by the Nazis.&lt;ref name="Eric Ehrenreich"&gt;Eric Ehrenreich. ''The Nazi Ancestral Proof: Genealogy, Racial Science, and the Final Solution''. Bloomington, Indiana, USA: Indiana University Press, pp.9-10&lt;/ref&gt; However, Achim Gerke revised Gorter's draft of the Civil Service Law classifying Aryans as people "tribally" related to "German blood"&lt;ref name="Eric Ehrenreich" /&gt; The [[Nuremberg Laws|Nuremberg race laws]] of 1935 classified as "racially acceptable" people with "German or related blood".&lt;ref name="Eric Ehrenreich" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ehrenreich, The Nazi ancestral proof, p.70&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitler often doubted whether Czechs were Aryan or not, he said in his table talk "It is enough for a Czech to grow a moustache for anyone to see, from the way the thing droops, that his origin is [[Mongoloid|Mongolian]]."&lt;ref name="Hitler2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Adolf Hitler|title=Hitler's Table Talk, 1941-1944: Secret Conversations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JIbqZ_F5UhkC|date=30 April 2008|publisher=Enigma Books|isbn=978-1-929631-66-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The question of whether Italians were Aryan enough was questioned by the Nazi racial theorists. Hitler viewed northern Italians as strongly Aryan, but not southern Italians. The Nazis viewed the downfall of the [[Roman Empire]] as being the result of the pollution of blood from racial intermixing, claiming that Italians were a hybrid of races, including black African races. Hitler even mentioned his view of the presence of Negroid blood in the Mediterranean peoples during his first meeting with Mussolini in 1934.&lt;ref name="Gillette2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Aaron Gillette|title=Racial Theories in Fascist Italy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8Gjq0ZPvIZgC|date=12 October 2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-52706-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of "Aryan" remained in constant flux to such an extent that the Nazis questioned whether European ethnic groups such as Finns or Hungarians were to be classified as "Aryans".&lt;ref name="Eric Ehrenreich" /&gt; Hungarians were classified as "tribally alien" but not necessarily "blood alien", in 1934 the Nazis published a pamphlet which declared [[Magyars]] (which it did not define) as Aryans.&lt;ref name="Ehrenreich p.10"/&gt; The following year, an article published by the Nazis admitted that there were disputes over the racial status of Hungarians.&lt;ref name="Ehrenreich p.10"/&gt; As late as 1943, there were disputes over whether Hungarians were to be classified as Aryan.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrenreich, The Nazi ancestral proof, p.11&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1942, Hitler declared that the Finns were "racially related Germanic neighboring peoples", although there is no evidence to suggest that this was based on anything racial.&lt;ref name="Ehrenreich p.10"/&gt;

The idea of the Northern origins of the Aryans was particularly influential in [[Germany]]. It was widely believed that the "Vedic Aryans" were ethnically identical to the [[Goths]], [[Vandals]] and other ancient Germanic peoples of the ''[[Völkerwanderung]]''. This idea was often intertwined with [[antisemitic]] ideas. The distinctions between the "Aryan" and "[[Semitic people|Semitic]]" peoples were based on the aforementioned linguistic and ethnic history. A complete, highly speculative theory of Aryan and anti-Semitic history can be found in [[Alfred Rosenberg]]'s major work, ''[[The Myth of the Twentieth Century]]''.
Semitic peoples came to be seen as a foreign presence within Aryan societies, and the Semitic peoples were often pointed to as the cause of conversion and destruction of social order and values leading to culture and civilization's downfall by proto-Nazi theorists such as [[Houston Stewart Chamberlain]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

These and other ideas evolved into the [[Nazism|Nazi]] use of the term "Aryan race" to refer to what they saw as being a [[master race|superior race]], which was narrowly defined by the Nazis as being identical with the [[Nordic race]], followed by other sub-races of the Aryan race and excluding Slavs as non-Aryan. They worked to maintain the purity of this race through [[Nazi eugenics|eugenics]] programs (including [[Miscegenation|anti-miscegenation]] legislation, [[compulsory sterilization]] of the mentally ill and the mentally deficient, the execution of the institutionalized mentally ill as part of a [[T-4 Euthanasia Program|euthanasia program]]).{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

[[Heinrich Himmler]] (the ''[[Reichsführer]]'' of the [[SS]]), the person ordered by [[Adolf Hitler]] to implement the [[Final Solution]], or the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]],&lt;ref&gt;Himmler noted on 26 July 1942 in response to Rosenberg’s attempt to influence Jewish policy that "The occupied territories will be [[Judenfrei|Jew-free]]. The [[Fuhrer]] has laid the implementation of this very difficult order on my shoulders." [[Richard J. Evans|Evans, Richard J.]] ''The Third Reich at War'' New York:2008 Penguin Page 271; Himmler had begun the initial pre-[[Wansee Conference]] implementation of the [[final solution]] by July and August of 1941. [[Richard J. Evans|Evans, Richard J.]] ''The Third Reich at War'' New York:2008 Penguin Page 240.&lt;/ref&gt; told his personal masseur [[Felix Kersten]] that he always carried with him a copy of the ancient [[Aryan]] scripture, the [[Bhagavad Gita]] because it relieved him of guilt about what he was doing – he felt that like the warrior [[Arjuna]], he was simply doing his duty without attachment to his actions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Padfield|Padfield, Peter]] ''Himmler'' New York: Henry Holt, 1990. p. 402.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Italian Fascism ===
{{main|Italian Fascism and racism}}

In a 1921 speech in [[Bologna]], Mussolini stated that "Fascism was born... out of a profound, perennial need of this our Aryan and [[Mediterranean race]]".&lt;ref&gt;Aaron Gillette. ''Racial Theories in Fascist Italy''. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2001. Pp. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neocleous, Mark. ''Fascism''. Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA: University of Minnesota Press, 1997. p.&amp;nbsp;35&lt;/ref&gt; In this speech Mussolini was referring to Italians as being the Mediterranean branch of the Aryan race, Aryan in the meaning of people of an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language]] and culture.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2001"&gt;Aaron Gillette. ''Racial Theories in Fascist Italy''. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2001. Pp. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Italian Fascism emphasized that race was bound by spiritual and cultural foundations, and identified a racial hierarchy based on spiritual and cultural factors.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2001"/&gt; While Italian Fascism based its conception of race on spiritual and cultural factors, Mussolini explicitly rejected notions that biologically "pure" races existed though biology was still considered a relevant factor in race.&lt;ref name="autogenerated5"&gt;Glenda Sluga. ''The Problem of Trieste and the Italo-Yugoslav Border: Difference, Identity, and Sovereignty in Twentieth-Century''. SUNY Press, 2001. P. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian Fascism strongly rejected the common [[Nordic race|Nordicist]] conception of the Aryan race that idealized "pure" Aryans as having certain physical traits that were defined as Nordic such as blond hair and blue eyes.&lt;ref name="autogenerated7"&gt;Aaron Gillette. ''Racial Theories in Fascist Italy''. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2001. Pp. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; The antipathy by Mussolini and other Italian Fascists to Nordicism was over the existence of what they viewed as the Mediterranean [[inferiority complex]] that they claimed had been instilled into Mediterraneans by the propagation of such theories by German and Anglo-Saxon Nordicists who viewed Mediterranean peoples as racially degenerate and thus in their view inferior.&lt;ref name="autogenerated7"/&gt; Mussolini refused to allow Italy to return again to this inferiority complex, initially rejecting Nordicism.&lt;ref name="autogenerated7"/&gt; However traditional Nordicist claims of Mediterraneans being degenerate due to having a darker colour of skin than Nordics had long been rebuked in anthropology through the depigmentation theory that claimed that lighter-skinned peoples had been depigmented from a darker skin, this theory has since become a widely accepted view in anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;Alan W. Ertl. Toward an Understanding of Europe:A Political Economic Précis of Continental Integration. Boca Raton, Florida, USA: Universal Publishers, 2008. P. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropologist [[Carleton S. Coon]] in his work ''The races of Europe'' (1939) subscribed to depigmentation theory that claimed that the Nordic race's light-coloured skin was the result of depigmentation from their ancestors of the Mediterranean race.&lt;ref&gt;Melville Jacobs, Bernhard Joseph Stern. General anthropology. Barnes &amp; Noble, 1963. P. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1930s, with the rise to power of the [[Nazi Party]] in Germany with ''[[Führer]]'' [[Adolf Hitler]]'s emphasis on a Nordicist conception of the Aryan race, strong tensions arose between the Fascists and the Nazis over racial issues. In 1934, in the aftermath of Austrian Nazis killing Austrian Chancellor [[Engelbert Dollfuss]], an ally of Italy, Mussolini became enraged and responded by angrily denouncing Nazism. Mussolini rebuked Nazism's Nordicism, claiming that the Nazis' emphasizing of a common Nordic "Germanic race" was absurd, saying "a Germanic race does not exist. ... We repeat. Does not exist. Scientists say so. Hitler says so."&lt;ref&gt;Aaron Gillette. Racial Theories in Fascist Italy. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2002. P. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that Germans were not purely Nordic was indeed acknowledged by prominent Nazi racial theorist [[Hans F. K. Günther]] in his book ''[[Rassenkunde des deutschen Volkes]]'' (1922) ("Racial Science of the German People"), where Günther recognized Germans as being composed of five Aryan subtype races: Nordic, Mediterranean, [[Dinaric race|Dinaric]], [[Alpine race|Alpine]], and [[East Baltic race|East Baltic]] while asserting that the Nordics were the highest in a racial hierarchy of the five subtypes.&lt;ref name="Maxwell150"/&gt;

By 1936, the tensions between Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany reduced and relations became more amicable. In 1936, Mussolini decided to launch a racial programme in Italy, and was interested in the racial studies being conducted by [[Giulio Cogni]].&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002. P. 60"&gt;Aaron Gillette. ''Racial Theories in Fascist Italy''. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2002. P. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;  Cogni was a Nordicist but did not equate Nordic identity with Germanic identity as was commonly done by German Nordicists.&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002. P. 61"&gt;Aaron Gillette. ''Racial Theories in Fascist Italy''. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2002. P. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Cogni had travelled to Germany where he had become impressed by Nazi racial theory and sought to create his own version of racial theory.&lt;ref&gt;Aaron Gillette. ''Racial Theories in Fascist Italy''. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2002. P. 59-60.&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 September 1936, Cogni sent Mussolini a copy of his newly published book ''Il Razzismo'' (1936).&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002. P. 60"/&gt; Cogni declared the racial affinity of the Mediterranean and Nordic racial subtypes of the Aryan race and claimed that the intermixing of Nordic Aryans and Mediterranean Aryans in Italy produced a superior synthesis of Aryan Italians.&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002. P. 61"/&gt; Cogni addressed the issue of racial differences between northern and southern Italians, declaring southern Italians were mixed between Aryan and non-Aryan races, that he claimed was most likely due to infiltration by Asiatic peoples in Roman times and later Arab invasions.&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002. P. 60"/&gt; As such, Cogni viewed Southern Italian Mediterraneans as being polluted with orientalizing tendencies.&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002. P. 60"/&gt; He would later change his idea and claim that Nordics and Southern Italians were closely related groups both racially and spiritually. His opinion was that they were generally responsible for what is the best in European civilization.&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002. P. 60"/&gt;  Initially Mussolini was not impressed with Cogni's work, however Cogni's ideas entered into the official Fascist racial policy several years later.&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002.

In 1938 Mussolini was concerned that if Italian Fascism did not recognize Nordic heritage within Italians, that the Mediterranean inferiority complex would return to Italian society.&lt;ref name="autogenerated7"/&gt; Therefore, in summer 1938, the Fascist government officially recognized Italians as having Nordic heritage and being of Nordic-Mediterranean descent and in a meeting with PNF members, and in June 1938 in a meeting with PNF members, Mussolini identified himself as Nordic and declared that previous policy of focus on Mediterraneanism was to be replaced by a focus on Aryanism.&lt;ref name="autogenerated7"/&gt;

The Fascist regime began publication of the racialist magazine ''[[La Difesa della Razza]]'' in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Aaron Gillette. ''Racial Theories in Fascist Italy''. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2002. P. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; The Nordicist racial theorist [[Guido Landra]] took a major role in the early work of ''La Difesa'', and published the ''Manifesto of Racial Scientists'' in the magazine in 1938.&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002. P. 80"&gt;Aaron Gillette. ''Racial Theories in Fascist Italy''. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2002. P. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Manifesto'' received substantial criticism, including its assertion of Italians being a "pure race", as it was viewed as absurd.&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002. P. 80"/&gt; ''La Difesa'' published other theories that described long-term Nordic Aryan amongst Italians, such as the theory that in the [[Eneolithic]] age Nordic Aryans arrived to Italy.&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002. P. 81"&gt;Aaron Gillette. ''Racial Theories in Fascist Italy''. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2002. P. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the writers took up the traditional Nordicist claim that the decline and fall of the Roman Empire was due to the arrival of Semitic immigrants.&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002. P. 81"/&gt; ''La Difesa'''s writers were divided on their claims that described how Italians extricated themselves from Semitic influence.&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002. P. 80"/&gt;

The Nordicist direction of Fascist racial policy was challenged in 1938 by a resurgence of the Mediterraneanist faction in the PNF.&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002. P. 110-111"&gt;Aaron Gillette. ''Racial Theories in Fascist Italy''. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2002. P. 110-111.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1939, the Mediterraneanists' advocacy of a nativist racial theory that rejected ascribing the achievements of the Italian people to Nordic peoples.&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002. P. 110-111"/&gt; This nativist racial policy was prominently promoted by [[Ugo Rellini]].&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002. P. 110-111"/&gt; Rellini rejected the notion of large-scale invasions of Italy by Nordic Aryans in the Eneolithic age, and claimed that Italians were an indigenous people descended from the [[Cro-Magnon]]s.&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002. P. 110-112"&gt;Aaron Gillette. ''Racial Theories in Fascist Italy''. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2002. P. 110-112.&lt;/ref&gt; Rellini claimed that Mediterranean and Nordic peoples arrived later and peacefully intermixed in small numbers with the indigenous Italian population.&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002. P. 110-112"/&gt;

In 1941 the PNF's Mediterraneanists through the influence of [[Giacomo Acerbo]] put forward a comprehensive definition of the Italian race.&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2001. Pp. 146"&gt;Aaron Gillette. ''Racial Theories in Fascist Italy''. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2001. Pp. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; However these efforts were challenged by Mussolini's endorsement of Nordicist figures with the appointment of staunch spiritual Nordicist [[Alberto Luchini]] as head of Italy's Racial Office in May 1941, as well as with Mussolini becoming interested in [[Julius Evola]]'s spiritual Nordicism in late 1941.&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2001. Pp. 146"/&gt; Acerbo and the Mediterraneanists in his High Council on Demography and Race sought to bring the regime back to supporting Mediterraneanism by thoroughly denouncing the pro-Nordicist ''Manifesto of the Racial Scientists''.&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2001. Pp. 146"/&gt; The Council recognized Aryans as being a linguistic-based group, and condemned the ''Manifesto'' for denying the influence of pre-Aryan civilization on modern Italy, saying that the ''Manifesto'' "constitutes an unjustifiable and undemonstrable negation of the anthropological, ethnological, and archaeological discoveries that have occurred and are occurring in our country".&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2001. Pp. 146"/&gt; Furthermore, the Council denounced the ''Manifesto'' for "implicitly" crediting Germanic invaders of Italy in the guise of the [[Lombards]] for having "a formative influence on the Italian race in a disproportional degree to the number of invaders and to their biological predominance".&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2001. Pp. 146"/&gt; The Council claimed that the obvious superiority of the ancient Greeks and Romans in comparison with the ancient Germanic tribes made it inconceivable that Italian culture owed a debt to ancient Aryan Germans.&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2001. Pp. 146"/&gt; The Council denounced the ''Manifesto'''s Nordicist attitude towards Mediterraneans that it claimed was "considering them as slaves" and was "a repudiation of the entire Italian civilization".&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2001. Pp. 146"/&gt;

[[Image:Crossed circle.svg|thumb|right|125px|The [[Sun cross|sun wheel]] has been used as a symbol of the Aryan race by some neo-Nazis]]

=== Neo-Nazism ===
Since the military defeat of Nazi Germany by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in 1945, some [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazis]] have developed a more inclusive definition of "Aryan", claiming that the peoples of [[Western Europe]] are the closest descendants of the ancient Aryans, with [[Nordic race|Nordic]] and [[Germanic peoples]] being the most "racially pure."&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke, Nicholas ''[[Black Sun (Goodrick-Clarke book)|Black Sun]]: Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism, and The Politics of Identity'' New York: 2002--N.Y. University Press, See Chapter 15 for a discussion of ''Aryan [[identity politics]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]], many neo-Nazis want to establish an [[Autocracy|autocratic state]] modeled after Nazi Germany to be called the ''[[Fourth Reich#Neo-Nazism|Western Imperium]]''. It is believed that this proposed state would be able to attain [[Hyperpower|world domination]] by combining the [[nuclear arsenal]]s of the four major Aryan [[world power]]s, the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], and [[Russia]] under a single military command.&lt;ref name="GC"&gt;{{cite book|author=Goodrick-Clarke, Nicholas|title=Black Sun: Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism and the Politics of Identity|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York|year=2003|pages=221|isbn=0-8147-3155-4|oclc = |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This proposed state would be led by a ''Führer''-like figure called the ''Vindex'', and would include all areas inhabited by the "Aryan race", as conceived by Neo-Nazis. Only those of the Aryan race would be full citizens of the state. The "Western Imperium" would embark on a vigorous and dynamic program of [[space exploration]], followed by the creation by [[genetic engineering]] of a  [[super race]] called [[Super race#Homo Galactica|Homo Galactica]]. The concept of the "Western Imperium" as outlined in the previous three sentences is based on the original concept of the ''Imperium'' as outlined in the 1947 book ''Imperium: The Philosophy of History and Politics'' by [[Francis Parker Yockey]] as further updated, extended and refined in the early 1990s in pamphlets published by [[David Myatt]].&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke, Nicholas ''[[Black Sun (Goodrick-Clarke book)|Black Sun]]: Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism, and The Politics of Identity'' New York: 2002--N.Y. University Press, See Chapters 4 and 11 for extensive information about the proposed "Western Imperium"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="myspace"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&amp;friendId=423609919&amp;blogId=497426085 |title=Featured Content on Myspace: "Vindex—The Destiny of the West—Imperium of the West" by David Myatt: |publisher=blogs.myspace.com|accessdate=August 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.natvan.com/national-vanguard/130/index.html "Space Exploration: An Expression of the Aryan Soul" by John Clarke [[National Vanguard (publication)|National Vanguard]] magazine Issue 130, January–February 2006:] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100228145502/http://www.natvan.com/national-vanguard/130/index.html |date=2010-02-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bi-Digital O-Ring Test''' ('''BDORT'''), characterized as a form of [[applied kinesiology]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mpdt.org.nz/decisionsorders/decisions/0289dfindings.pdf Medical Practitioner's Disciplinary Tribunal of New Zealand characterization of BDORT as a form of Applied Kinesiology, paragraphs 305, 306, et alia]&lt;/ref&gt; is a patented [[alternative medicine]] diagnostic procedure in which a patient forms an 'O' with his or her fingers, and the diagnostician subjectively evaluates the patient's health according to the patient's finger strength as the diagnostician tries to pry them apart.&lt;ref name=pat2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mpdt.org.nz/decisionsorders/decisions/0289dfindings.pdf Medical Practitioner's Disciplinary Tribunal of New Zealand characterization of BDORT as subjective, paragraphs 61, 318, 331 et alia]&lt;/ref&gt;

BDORT has been cited and characterized at length by the American Institute for Technology and Science Education as a specific and noteworthy example of [[pseudoscientific]] [[quackery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.aitse.org/assessing-scientific-claims-the-o-ring/ |title=– American Institute for Technology and Science Education |access-date=27 November 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427204953/http://www.aitse.org/assessing-scientific-claims-the-o-ring/ |archive-date=27 April 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

BDORT was invented by Yoshiaki Omura, along with several other related alternative medicine techniques. They are featured in Omura's self-published ''Acupuncture &amp; Electro-Therapeutics Research, The International Journal,'' of which Omura is founder and editor-in-chief, as well as in seminars presented by Omura and his colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://icaet.org International College of Acupuncture &amp; Electro-Therapeutics, Omura's US site]&lt;/ref&gt;

Omura is registered to practice acupuncture in New York State.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nysed.gov/coms/op001/opsc2a?profcd=60&amp;plicno=122947&amp;namechk=OMU New York State Education Department, Office of the Professions]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the only known full, formal independent evaluation of BDORT or of any other BDORT-related treatment and technique by a mainstream scientific or medical body, the [[Medical Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal]] of New Zealand ruled, in two separate cases brought before it in 2003, that [[Richard Gorringe|Richard Warwick Gorringe]], [[Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery|MB, ChB]] of [[Hamilton, New Zealand]], who used BDORT (which he also called "Peak Muscle Resistance Testing", or "PMRT") to the exclusion of conventional diagnoses on his patients, was guilty of malpractice. In the first case, the Tribunal found it "is not a plausible, reliable, or scientific technique for making medical decisions"  and "there is no plausible evidence that PMRT has any scientific validity".&lt;ref name=nz&gt;[http://www.mpdt.org.nz/decisionsorders/decisions/0289dfindings.pdf Medical Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal of New Zealand findings in re Richard Gorringe and the PMRT/Bi-Digital O-Ring Test]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=qwnzt12&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.quackwatch.org/11Ind/gorringe.html|title=Disciplinary Actions against Dr. Richard Gorringe}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the second case the Tribunal ruled Gorringe again relied on BDORT to the exclusion of traditional diagnoses, which ultimately led to the death of a patient.&lt;ref name=qwnzt12/&gt;&lt;ref name=nzt2&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mpdt.org.nz/decisionsorders/decisions2003/03113cfindings.pdf|title=2004 NZT Report on Richard Gorringe|access-date=27 January 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061002214238/http://www.mpdt.org.nz/decisionsorders/decisions2003/03113cfindings.pdf|archive-date=2 October 2006|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of these findings and conclusions, Gorringe was fined and stripped of his license to practice medicine.

==Yoshiaki Omura==
{{Nihongo|Yoshiaki Omura|大村恵昭|''Ōmura Yoshiaki''}} is president and founder of the ''International College of Acupuncture &amp; Electro-Therapeutics,'' president and founder of the ''International Bi-Digital O-Ring Test Medical Association,'' and medical research director of the ''Heart Disease Research Foundation.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://bdort.net/en/omurast.htm CV/Biography of Dr. Yoshiaki Omura at Omura's Japanese site]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The test is a subjective evaluation of a patient's opposing muscle strength in which a diagnostician employs the thumb and forefinger of each hand, formed in the shape of an O, to attempt to force apart an O shape formed by the patient who places the fingertips of their thumb and one of their remaining fingers together. At the same time, the patient holds a slide of [[organ (anatomy)|organ tissue]], a sample of [[medication]], potential [[allergen]], etc., in their free hand, or is otherwise 'probed' at an appropriate [[acupuncture point]] by the use of a metal rod or laser pointer. The diagnostician then uses their perception of the strength required to force apart the patient's 'O-Ring' of thumb and one of the remaining fingers to assess the patient's health.&lt;ref name=pat2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baobab.or.jp/~oring/e_basis.shtml#compatibility Omura Japanese site description of BDORT]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bm&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bpmlegal.com/wfinger.html  |title= Pull my finger! - BI-DIGITAL O-RING TEST FOR IMAGING AND DIAGNOSIS OF INTERNAL ORGANS OF A PATIENT|publisher=Brown &amp; Michaels PC|accessdate=2011-02-01 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080229073951/http://www.bpmlegal.com/wfinger.html |archivedate = 29 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Patent==
The [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] (USPTO) rejected the initial BDORT patent application as 'too unbelievable to be true'. The application was then resubmitted in 1987, and the USPTO again rejected it. After receiving expert testimony from Omura's "associates in clinical fields and basic sciences, both in Japan and the United States" regarding BDORT, the USPTO issued {{Cite patent|US|5188107}} in 1993.&lt;ref name=pat2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bdort.net/en/1sad2.htm Yoshiaki Omura's description of patent quest at his Japanese site]&lt;/ref&gt;

The fact that a patent was granted to the BDORT has been cited as an example of 'high weirdness' by one firm of patent attorneys.&lt;ref name=bm/&gt;

==Suggested uses and variants==
The BDORT is capable, according to its proponents, of a wide range of applications in the diagnosis, prescription of treatment, and evaluation of efficacy of treatment of, amongst others: heart conditions, cancers, 'pre-cancers', allergic reactions, viral and bacterial infections, a range of organic and/or environmental stresses, as well as the precise location of acupuncture points and meridians previously unknown or inappropriately identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://users.med.auth.gr/~karanik/english/articles/icmart99/ab26.htm |title=Omura abstract |access-date=30 July 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927175544/http://users.med.auth.gr/~karanik/english/articles/icmart99/ab26.htm |archive-date=27 September 2006 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.baobab.or.jp/~oring/e_index.shtml |title=Omura's Japanese web site capsule description of BDORT applications |access-date=30 July 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060824073432/http://www.baobab.or.jp/~oring/e_index.shtml |archive-date=24 August 2006 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bdort.net/en/18thSympo.html BDORT 18th Symposium]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bdort.net/en/19thSympo.html BDORT 19th Symposium]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other than the New Zealand [[Medical Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal]]'s [[BDORT#Medical Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal of New Zealand review of BDORT|reports]], there is no known independent mainstream scientific or medical evaluation or validation of any of the BDORT or BDORT-related claims, including the following BDORT variants:

;The Indirect Method
:In the Indirect Method of application an intermediary is employed, and the patient is not directly examined. The intermediary, for example, directs a laser pointer held in his or her right hand at the appropriate acupuncture point, for example, atop the patient's head, while at the same time the diagnostician performs the test on the left hand of the intermediary.&lt;ref name=pat2/&gt;&lt;ref name=bm/&gt;

;Remote Application
:Omura claims that it is possible, if the procedure is performed by a very experienced practitioner such as himself, to perform the BDORT on a patient over the telephone without having any physical contact with the patient. In this procedure the patient is, for example, instructed to hold in one hand a substance being evaluated, while holding the telephone receiver at the bodily location prescribed by the diagnostician. The practitioner then evaluates the muscle strength necessary to separate the interlocked O–rings of thumb and forefinger of each of his or her own two hands, and uses this data in place of data from standard BDORT on the patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://bdort.net/pdf/6thSympoEngAbst.pdf |title=Omura seminar article by Dominic Lu, DDS, presenting diagnosis by Omura via BDORT via telephone |access-date=22 May 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060504080357/http://bdort.net/pdf/6thSympoEngAbst.pdf |archive-date=4 May 2006 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Selective Drug Uptake Enhancement Method
:The Selective Drug Uptake Enhancement Method is a central component of BDORT-derived treatments according to Omura. He claims that with this treatment it is possible, via BDORT diagnosis and evaluation coupled with appropriate [[acupuncture point]] stimulation, to 'target' [[alternative medicine|alternative]] or conventional medications to specific cells or tissues, for example, cancer cells. According to Omura, when this occurs the medications will have minimal 'uptake' by non-targeted tissues or cells, thus maximizing the efficacy of the prescribed medications while minimizing side effects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tmj-pain.com/Omura.pdf Omura Selective Drug Uptake and CV]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=12934959&amp;query_hl=9&amp;itool=pubmed_docsum Abstract of Omura paper in ''Acupuncture Electrotherapeutics Resonance'']&lt;/ref&gt;  There is no known independent verification of these claims.

;Solar energy stored papers
:Special Solar Energy: Solar Energy Stored Papers (SESP) is a device which Omura claims was developed using BDORT assessment and evaluation, that can capture a special healing power of sunlight. Omura uses index cards or other ordinary paper and he says the sunlight must be 'captured' at the ideal times of sunrise and sunset. Omura says the energy can then be preserved in SESP while maintaining appropriate ''[[qigong]]'' polarity and shielding the papers from electromagnetic fields by carefully wrapping them in aluminum foil. Thus captured and preserved, he claims that Special Solar Energy is effective in the treatment of a number of conditions, including arthritis, cancers, hypertension, and Alzheimer's disease. He has applied for a patent for this process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite patent|US|2005278006|application}}, Special Solar Energy Stored Papers and Their Application&lt;/ref&gt;

;Psychic healing
:Omura, as published in his journal, has investigated the application of psychic healing and [[psychic surgery]] in Brazil, particularly that of [[Rubens Farias Jr.|Rubens Farias, Jr]], who claims to channel the spirit of [[Dr. Fritz|Dr Fritz]]. Applying the BDORT as his tool of evaluation, he concluded that psychic healing's and psychic surgery's healing effects were achieved through the application of ''qigong'' energy and the use of [[acupuncture points]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aegis.com/aidsline/1997/oct/M97A0099.html Abstract of Omura's observations on psychic healing and psychic surgery in Brazil as published in his journal, ''Acupuncture &amp; Electro-Therapeutics Research, The International Journal'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal of New Zealand review of BDORT==
The [[Medical Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal|New Zealand Medical Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal]], ruled on two separate malpractice cases against [[Richard Gorringe|Richard Warwick Gorringe]], [[Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery|MB, ChB]], of [[Hamilton, New Zealand]].&lt;ref name=qwnzt12/&gt;
In the first, held in [[Wellington]] in 2003,&lt;ref name=nz/&gt; where BDORT was also referred to as 'PMRT' ('Peak Muscle Resistance Testing') by Gorringe,&lt;ref&gt;2003 NZ Tribunal Findings, Paragraph 363 (Note that the Tribunal uses the terms PMRT and BDORT interchangeably, characterizing both as a form of [[Applied kinesiology|Applied Kinesiology]], cf Paragraphs 100, 280, 290, 297, 305, 306, et alia)&lt;/ref&gt; the tribunal examined and dismissed any claims of scientific validity of BDORT, offering the following summary statement of findings:&lt;ref name=nz/&gt;{{quotation|We therefore accept that PMRT is not a plausible, reliable, or scientific technique for making medical decisions. We find there is no plausible evidence that PMRT has any scientific validity. It therefore follows that reliance on PMRT to make diagnoses to the exclusion of conventional and/or generally recognized diagnostic/investigatory techniques is unacceptable and irresponsible.}}

As a result of these findings and conclusions, Gorringe was fined and stripped of his license to practice medicine.

In separate hearings the Medical Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal held in December 2003 and ruled upon in May 2004 in [[Auckland]], found Gorringe guilty of malpractice in the death of an earlier patient, and concluded that Gorringe's reliance on BDORT to the exclusion of conventional diagnoses led to the patient's death.&lt;ref name=qwnzt12/&gt;&lt;ref name=nzt2/&gt;

===BDORT testimony used by Wellington tribunal in its decision===
Several expert witnesses provided testimony about BDORT at the MPDT Wellington hearings, with which the tribunal concurred:{{quotation|In summary, I find the descriptions of the AK [applied kinesiology] methods and in particular the BDORT test to be inconsistent with known physical principles. Even if it were possible to produce a “field” with these methods, AK [applied kinesiology] methods (and BDORTing) [testing] have not been shown to produce an electrical field which is required to alter the electrical activation of nerve and muscle. A limited survey of the literature shows that the AK [applied kinesiology] testing results are unreliable – and this idea is apparently supported by some organisations that support complementary medicine. I find it deeply disturbing that the only people who seem to claim reliable diagnostic results are those who make a living from applying it and some controlled scientific tests reveal no validity to these claims.|Professor Mark Bryden Cannell &amp;ndash; Tribunal Findings, par. 306&lt;ref name=nz/&gt;}}

{{quotation|BDORT is operator dependent, meaning that what actually happens is that the operator diagnoses whatever it is that he believes in. One cannot scientifically evaluate “belief”. In the context of testing, then, it would be impossible to challenge the practitioner’s belief in his apparatus.|John Charles Welch, MD &amp;ndash; Tribunal Findings, par. 314&lt;ref name=nz/&gt;}}

{{quotation|I think the big problem with the Bi-Digital O-Ring Test is the fact that it’s not been properly tested to make sure that the results are reproducible. As Professor Cannell alluded to in his evidence, the key thing about science is a naive observer anywhere in the world should be able to reproduce the results using the same apparatus.|John Charles Welch, MD &amp;ndash; Tribunal Findings, par. 316&lt;ref name=nz/&gt;}}

===Equivalence with PMRT===
In the first New Zealand MPDT report from [[Wellington]] in 2003, the tribunal defines the terms PMRT and BDORT as equivalent:{{quotation|At each consultation Dr Gorringe "muscle tested" Mrs Short by a procedure called "Peak Muscle Resistance Testing" which he used as a diagnostic tool. We refer to this procedure later and throughout this judgment as PMRT. It is also referred to as Bi Digital O Ring Testing (BDORT).|New Zealand MPDT (2003), par. 100&lt;ref name=nz/&gt;}}

Later in the same report, the tribunal again equates PMRT and BDORT, but states that the technique used by Gorringe is different from Dr. Omura's:{{quotation|Dr. Gorringe gave evidence as to the background relating to PMRT (or BDORT) and attributed the origin of it to Dr. Yoshiaki Omura and produced some written material relating to the Omura technique (exhibits 31 and 42). However, it would appear from a perusal of those materials that the technique which Dr. Gorringe practices is different from that practiced by Dr. Omura and therefore the Omura materials do not assist the Tribunal to any real extent.|New Zealand MPDT (2003), par. 290&lt;ref name=nz/&gt;}}

The tribunal uses the terms BDORT and PMRT interchangeably throughout the Wellington report from 2003.

In the second MPDT report from [[Auckland]] in 2004,&lt;ref name=nzt2/&gt; the tribunal does not mention PMRT at all, and refers to Gorringe's technique exclusively as 'BDORT'.

The [[Quackwatch]] article reviewing these two New Zealand MPDT reports also equates PMRT and BDORT, stating:{{quotation|The test Gorringe used is called peak muscle resistance testing (PMRT) -- also referred to as bi digital O ring testing (BDORT) -- in which the practitioner observes whether the subject's opposed thumb and fourth fingers can be pulled apart...|[[Quackwatch]]&lt;ref name=qwnzt12/&gt;}}

==BDORT-related courses==
BDORT-related seminars, given by Omura, are conducted monthly in New York. The [[University of the State of New York]] Education Department allows these seminars to count towards course credit for physicians and dentists seeking certification for the application of [[acupuncture]] in the course of their practice.&lt;ref name=nysem&gt;[http://www.op.nysed.gov/acupuncert.htm New York State Education Department Listing of Registered Programs for Certification in Acupuncture]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=icaetnysem&gt;[http://icaet.org/seminars.html Omura's US site, with reference to seminars and content]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a Decision of 15 May 2007 the [[Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal]], in [[Victoria, Australia]], in an [[appeal]] against a [[Case law|decision]] by the [[Acupuncture#Australia|Chinese Medical Registration Board]] of Victoria refusing registration to practice as an [[acupuncturist]], found that attendance and participation in Yoshiaki Omura's ''Annual International Symposium on Acupuncture &amp; Electro-Therapeutics'' as accredited by the [[University of the State of New York]] [[New York State Education Department|Education Department]], in addition to "clinical experience ... with these subjects in respect of real patients" did not meet the Chinese Medicine Board's requirement of "competencies substantially equivalent to" those taught in a Board certified acupuncture class. Given this, the Tribunal ruled that the Board was not required to certify the applicant as a practitioner of Chinese medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cmrb.vic.gov.au/board/MalterVCATDecisionMay2007.pdf |title=Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal Decision |access-date=29 June 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070810034139/http://www.cmrb.vic.gov.au/board/MalterVCATDecisionMay2007.pdf |archive-date=10 August 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/vic/VCAT/2007/815.html Australasian Legal Information Institute]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Body Worlds''' ([[German language|German]] title: Körperwelten) is a traveling exposition of dissected human bodies, animals, and other [[Anatomy|anatomical]] structures of the body that have been preserved through the process of [[plastination]]. [[Gunther von Hagens]] developed the preservation process which "unite[s] subtle anatomy and modern polymer chemistry",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koerperwelten.com/de/plastination/plastinationsprozess.html|title=Plastination|website=www.koerperwelten.com|access-date=14 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160601170955/http://www.koerperwelten.com/de/plastination/plastinationsprozess.html|archive-date=1 June 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the late 1970s.

A series of ''Body Worlds'' anatomical exhibitions has toured many countries worldwide, sometimes raising controversies about the sourcing and display of actual human corpses and body parts. Nevertheless, Von Hagens maintains that all human specimens were obtained with full knowledge and consent of the donors before they died, and his organization keeps extensive documentation of this permission. Von Hagens emphasizes both educational and artistic aspects of his complex and innovative dissections, and offers online teaching guides for educators. He also tries to distinguish his efforts from those of competitors who may have been less thorough in obtaining advance permission from their specimen sources.

==Background==
[[File:Body Worlds Exhibit San Diego 2009.jpg|thumb|Gunther von Hagens' Body Worlds, San Diego, California, 2009]]

===Method===
The exhibit states that its purpose and mission is the education of laymen about the human body, leading to better health awareness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.channelm.co.uk/video_4x3.html?bcpid=1213934526&amp;bctid=1454906724 |title=Channel M No Smoking Day 12 March 2008 |publisher=Channelm.co.uk |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010 }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; All the human plastinates are from people who donated their bodies for plastination via a body donation program. Each Body Worlds exhibition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bodyworlds.com/en/media/picture_database/thumbnails.html?category=15 |title=Body Worlds Exhibitions |publisher=Bodyworlds.com |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716175844/http://www.bodyworlds.com/en/media/picture_database/thumbnails.html?category=15# |archive-date=16 July 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; contains approximately 25 full-body plastinates with expanded or selective [[organ (biology)|organs]] shown in positions that enhance the role of certain systems.

To produce specimens for ''Body Worlds'', von Hagens employs 340 people at five laboratories in three countries, China, Germany and Kyrgyzstan. Each laboratory is categorized by specialty, with the China laboratory focusing on animal specimens. One of the most difficult specimens to create was the [[giraffe]] that appears in ''Body Worlds &amp; The Cycle of Life''. The specimen took three years to complete – ten times longer than it takes to prepare a human body. Ten people are required to move the giraffe, because its final weight (like all specimens after plastination) is equal to the original animal.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

More than 200 specimens of real human organs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bodyworlds.com/en/media/picture_database/thumbnails.html?category=4 |title=Plastinated Organs |publisher=Bodyworlds.com |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110115101531/http://www.bodyworlds.com/en/media/picture_database/thumbnails.html?category=4# |archive-date=15 January 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and organ systems are displayed in glass cases, some showing various medical conditions. Some of the specimens, such as the Tai Chi Man, demonstrate interventions, and include [[prosthesis|prosthetics]] such as [[hip replacement|artificial hip]] [[joint]]s or [[heart valve]]s. Also featured is a liver with cirrhosis and the lungs of a smoker and non-smoker are placed side by side. A prenatal display features fetuses and [[embryo]]s, some with [[congenital disorder]]s.

===Tours===
Body Worlds exhibitions have received more than 37 million visitors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bodyworlds.com/en/exhibitions/past_exhibitions.html |title=Exhibitions |publisher=Bodyworlds.com |date= |accessdate=27 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120522014837/http://www.bodyworlds.com/en/exhibitions/past_exhibitions.html# |archive-date=22 May 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; making them the world's most popular touring attraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,443881,00.html |title=Fox news Dead Body Show Promotes Health, Exhibitor Says |publisher=Foxnews.com |date=24 October 2008 |accessdate=25 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Body Worlds'' was first presented in [[Tokyo]] in 1995. Body Worlds exhibitions have since been hosted by more than 50 museums and venues in North America, Europe and Asia. ''Body Worlds 2 &amp; The Brain – Our Three Pound Gem'' (concerning the brain and [[nervous system]]) opened in 2005 at the [[California Science Center]] in [[Los Angeles]]. {{As of|2010|September}} it is showing at the [[Science World (Vancouver)|Telus World of Science]] in [[Vancouver]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scienceworld.ca/bodyworlds|title=Galleries &amp; Theatres - Science World British Columbia|website=www.scienceworld.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several Body Worlds exhibits (as well as Von Hagens himself) were featured in the 2006 film ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]''. Among the plastinates featured were the ''Poker Playing Trio'' (which plays a key role in one scene) and ''Rearing Horse and Rider''.

''Body Worlds 3 &amp; The Story of the Heart'' (concerning the [[cardiovascular system]]) opened on 25 February 2006, at the [[Houston Museum of Natural Science]]. On 9 July 2009 this show appeared at the [[Buffalo Museum of Science]] in [[Buffalo, New York]]. {{As of|2010|May}}, it is showing at the [[Denver Museum of Nature and Science]] in [[Denver]], Colorado.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dmns.org/exhibitions/current-exhibitions Current Exhibitions], Denver Museum of Nature and Science. Retrieved 19 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Body Worlds 4'' debuted 22 February 2008 at the [[Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester]] in [[England]] and was in the Cureghem Cellars in [[Brussels]] until March 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bodyworlds.red-dog.com/ Cureghem Cellars Official BODY WORLDS site] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090610060739/http://bodyworlds.red-dog.com/ |date=10 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Body Worlds &amp; The Mirror of Time'' (featuring human development and aging) debuted at [[The O2 (London)|The O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] in London in October 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.visitlondon.com/bodyworlds |title=Visit London BODY WORLDS at the O2 official site |publisher=Visitlondon.com |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090727080255/http://www.visitlondon.com/bodyworlds/ |archivedate=27 July 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Körperwelten &amp; Der Zyklus Des Lebens (The cycle of life)'' opened in Heidelberg in January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koerperwelten-deutschland.de/english.html Körperwelten &amp; Der Zyklus Des Lebens]{{Dead link|date=February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Body Worlds Vital'' was inaugurated at the Universum museum of the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]] in 2012.&lt;ref name=universum&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.universum.unam.mx/bodyworlds/en/ |title=Body Worlds Vital |publisher=UNAM |accessdate=1 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulatory framework==

===Czech Republic===
In July 2008, the Czech Senate passed a law to address illegal trading in human tissue and ban "advertising of donation of human cells and tissues for money or similar advantages".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/news/index_view.php?id=323506 |title=Czech Senate toughens rules for handling of human tissue |publisher=Ceskenoviny.cz |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
On Tuesday 21 April 2009, a French judge ruled concerning the [[Paris]] exhibition of ''Our Body: The Universe Within'', that exhibiting dead bodies for profit was a "violation of the respect owed to them". "Under the law, the proper place for corpses is in the cemetery", said Judge Louis-Marie Raingeard. Raingeard ordered the exhibition to close within 24 hours or face a fine of 20,000 euro (over 26,000 dollars) for each day it stayed open. The judge also ordered authorities to seize the 17 bodies on display and all of the organs on display from an unknown number of people for proper burial. Gunther Von Hagens issued a press statement denying any connection between the closed Chinese exhibition and his Body Worlds franchise.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abcnews.go.com/Blotter/story?id=7411070 France Shuts Down Popular Bodies Show]&amp;page=1&lt;/ref&gt; Similar exhibitions had already been successfully staged in [[Lyon]] and [[Marseille]].

===United Kingdom===

====England and Wales====
The [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK Parliament]] created legislation for exhibits of human remains, including plastinated bodies and body parts, in [[England and Wales]] under the [[Human Tissue Act 2004]]. This requires a licence to be granted by the [[Human Tissue Authority]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hta.gov.uk/licensing.cfm HTA Licensing] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090424090842/http://www.hta.gov.uk/licensing.cfm |date=24 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Human Tissue Act superseded the [[Anatomy Act 1832]], which had been found by an independent commission (The Redfern Report)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/jan/31/alderhey1 |title=UK, Main findings of the Redfern report |publisher=Guardian |date= 31 January 2001|accessdate=25 February 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; to be inadequate on contemporary collection and use of human tissues, following the [[Alder Hey organs scandal]]. In March 2008, the [[Manchester Museum of Science and Industry]] was granted such a licence to hold ''Body Worlds 4'' and a further licence was granted to the exhibition in the O2, London, in 2008.

====Scotland====
The [[Human Tissue (Scotland) Act 2006]] – which amended the Anatomy Act 1984 – covers Scotland. Under the terms of this Act, licences for the handling of human remains, including display, must be granted directly by the Scottish Ministry.

{{quote|Subsection 9: If the Scottish Ministers think it desirable to do so in the interests of education, training or research, they may grant a license to a person to publicly display the body or, as the case may be, the part, and a person is authorized under this subsection to so display a body or a part of a body if, at the time of the display he is licensed under this subsection.}}

Various organizations gave evidence to the [[Scottish Executive]] during the consultation process, including the [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh]], the [[Wellcome Trust]], and the [[Museums Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumsassociation.org/ma/11480 |title=Response by the Museums Association on the Human Tissue (Scotland) Bill |publisher=Museums Association |date=8 September 2005 |accessdate=25 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
Various legislation has been proposed and enacted in different American states. Most proposals concentrate on issues regarding the sale of human remains and the consent of the donors.

National legislation on consent and tissue donation issues is expressed in the [[Uniform Anatomical Gift Act]] (2006)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anatomicalgiftact.org/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabindex=1&amp;tabid=63 |title=Anatomical Gift Act |publisher=Anatomical Gift Act |date=26 August 2009 |accessdate=25 February 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923090355/http://www.anatomicalgiftact.org/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabindex=1&amp;tabid=63# |archive-date=23 September 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; passed by the [[National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws]] which states that "an anatomical gift of a donor's body or part may be made during the life of the donor for the purpose of transplantation, therapy, research, or education" and prohibits trafficking in donated human organs for profit.

In early 2008, former U.S. Republican Representative [[Todd Akin|W. Todd Akin]] proposed an amendment to the [[Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act]] of 1930&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statesurge.com/bills/69436-hr5677-federal |title=Amends the Tariff Act of 1930 |publisher=Statesurge.com |date=16 April 2008 |accessdate=25 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; to "make it unlawful for a person to import plastinated human remains into the United States." The President of the American Association of Anatomists has expressed concern that the scope of the act is "too broad" and that "Preventing importation of all plastinated specimens could severely restrict their use for medical education.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anatomy.org/Files/private/newsletters/aaa_sept_nl.pdf |title=American Association of Anatomists Newsletter Vol. 17, No. 3, September 2008 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327110113/http://www.anatomy.org/Files/private/newsletters/aaa_sept_nl.pdf |archivedate=27 March 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill of amendment was not enacted during the 2007–2008 Congressional session.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h110-5677 |title=H.R. 5677: To amend the Tariff Act of 1930 |publisher=Govtrack.us |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====California====
California's proposed bill AB1519 (Ma), sponsored by Assemblywoman [[Fiona Ma]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ma |url=http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/07-08/bill/asm/ab_1501-1550/ab_1519_bill_20080617_amended_sen_v92.html |title=California State bill AB1519 (Ma) |publisher=Leginfo.ca.gov |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; tried to "require exhibitors to get a county permit; to do so, they would have to prove to county health officials that the people whose cadavers were on display — or their next of kin — had consented".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-corpse25jan25,0,2070702.story |title=Cadaver shows raise consent concerns – Los Angeles Times |publisher=Latimes.com |date=25 January 2008 |first=Marc |last=Lifsher |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080129210804/http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-corpse25jan25%2C0%2C2070702.story |archivedate=29 January 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assembly Bill 1519 would have made California the first state to require such proof.&lt;ref name="californiachronicle.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.californiachronicle.com/articles/71686 |title=Legislation to Regulate Dead Body Exhibits Moves on to The Governor |publisher=Californiachronicle.com |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110911144748/http://www.californiachronicle.com/articles/71686 |archivedate=11 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was vetoed by Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] on 26 September 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[ftp://leginfo.ca.gov/pub/07-08/bill/asm/ab_1501-1550/ab_1519_bill_20080926_history.html A.B. No. 1519 bill history, from the Government of California]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Florida====
The state of [[Florida]] prohibits the sale or purchase of human remains and "Authorizes certain science centers located in this state to transport plastinated bodies into, within, or out of this state and exhibit such bodies for the purpose of public education without the consent of this state's anatomical board if the science center notifies the board of any such transportation or exhibition, as well as the location and duration of any exhibition, at least 30 days before such transportation or exhibition".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leg.state.fl.us/cgi-bin/view_page.pl?Tab=session&amp;Submenu=1&amp;FT=D&amp;File=sb2554.html&amp;Directory=session/2007/Senate/bills/billtext/html/ |title=State of Florida Legislation |publisher=Leg.state.fl.us |date=1 July 2007 |accessdate=25 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hawaii====
In January 2009, Rep. Marcus Oshiro introduced two bills prompted by presentation of the BODIES Exhibition in that state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starbulletin.com/editorials/20090129_Enact_restrictions_on_cadavers_shown_in_public_exhibits.html |title=Enact restrictions on cadavers shown in public exhibits |publisher=Starbulletin.com |date=29 January 2009 |accessdate=25 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HB28 Relating to Dead Human Bodies would add to the prohibition against buying dead human bodies, the selling of dead human bodies and defines the term "dead human body" to include plastinated bodies and body parts. It would increase the fine for buying or selling a dead human body to up to $5,000.

HB29 Relating to Dead Human Bodies. Would prohibit the commercial display of dead human bodies without a permit from the Department of Health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Georgette |url=http://hawaiihouseblog.blogspot.com/2009/01/inspired-by-bodies.html |title=Hawaii House Blog: Inspired by Bodies |publisher=Hawaiihouseblog.blogspot.com |date=23 January 2009 |accessdate=25 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====New York====
In June 2008, [[New York (state)|New York]] State Senate passed legislation regulating body exhibits. A bill that was sponsored by Senator Jim Alesi requires anyone showing an exhibit that uses real human bodies in New York museums to produce a permit detailing their origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rochesterhomepage.net/content/fulltext/?cid=17741 |title=Rochester Homepage Cracking down on human body exhibits |publisher=Rochesterhomepage.net |date=19 June 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208180852/http://rochesterhomepage.net/content/fulltext/?cid=17741 | archivedate = 8 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pennsylvania====
Representative [[Mike Fleck|Mike Fleck's]] proposed bill would require evidence of informed consent from the decedent or relatives of all humans whose remains are put on display.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legis.state.pa.us/CFDOCS/Legis/PN/Public/btCheck.cfm?txtType=HTM&amp;sessYr=2007&amp;sessInd=0&amp;billBody=H&amp;billTyp=B&amp;billNbr=2299&amp;pn=3339 |title=Pennsylvania bodies exhibit regulatory bill |publisher=Legis.state.pa.us |date=10 March 2008 |accessdate=25 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Washington====
The state of [[Washington (state)|Washington]] considered a bill that would "require written authorization to display human remains for a commercial purpose".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.leg.wa.gov/billinfo/Summary.aspx?bill=1253&amp;year=2007 |title=State of Washington Bill Requiring written authorization to display human remains for a commercial purpose |publisher=Apps.leg.wa.gov |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious groups, including representatives of the [[Catholic Church]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://rcav.org/2010-09-30-concerns-about-body-worlds/ Archdiocese of Vancouver – Body Worlds Exhibit] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413125000/http://rcav.org/2010-09-30-concerns-about-body-worlds/ |date=13 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and some [[Jewish]] rabbis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=DEBORAH SUSSMAN SUSSER Associate Editor |url=http://www.jewishaz.com/issues/story.mv?070209+body |title='Body Worlds' comes to Phoenix – Jewish News of Greater Phoenix |publisher=Jewishaz.com |date=9 February 2007 |accessdate=25 February 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609080641/http://www.jewishaz.com/issues/story.mv?070209+body |archive-date=9 June 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; have objected to the display of human remains, stating that it is inconsistent with reverence towards the human body.

===Sex plastinate===
In 2003, while promoting a display in the Hamburg Museum of Erotica, von Hagens announced his intention to create a sex plastinate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Sky-News-Archive/Article/200806412221471 |title=Prof in Corpse Sex plan |publisher=News.sky.com |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090613044212/http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Sky-News-Archive/Article/200806412221471 |archivedate=13 June 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2009 he unveiled a plastinate of a couple having sex, intended for a Berlin exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Von Peter Kiefer Und Claudia Weingärtner |url=http://www.bild.de/BILD/regional/berlin/aktuell/2009/05/05/koerperwelten-dr-tod-gunther-von-hagens/er-zeigt-leichen-beim-sex.html |title=Dr. Tod zeigt Leichensex in Berlin |publisher=Bild.de |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lessening donor organ availability===
In 2007, the [[Bishop of Manchester]] launched a campaign&lt;ref&gt;Bishop of Manchester's campaign Site Corpseshow.info&lt;/ref&gt; to coincide with the opening of Body Worlds in that city, accusing the exhibitors of being "body snatchers" and "robbing the NHS", arguing that donation of bodies for plastination would deprive the [[National Health Service]] of organs for transplant. The site included a government petition calling for "a review of the law regarding the policies and practices of touring shows involving corpses".

===Consent===
{{see also|Organ harvesting from Falun Gong practitioners in China}}
Consent is a primary focus of discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B7GWX-4R71KF2-1&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=6ba114742d1043defa8f00ec7295486b |title=Looking Back and Looking Ahead |publisher=Science Direct |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010 |doi=10.1016/j.aanat.2007.07.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2004, the German news magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' reported that von Hagens had acquired corpses of executed prisoners in China; von Hagens countered that he did not know the origin of the bodies, and returned seven disputed cadavers to China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Angelique Chrisafis in Paris |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/apr/21/corpse-france-hagens-ouvert |title= French Judge Closes Body Worlds Style Exhibition of Corpses |work= The Guardian |date= 21 April 2009|accessdate=25 February 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, von Hagens obtained an injunction against ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' for making the claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pressemeldinger.no/read.asp?RecNo=15417 |title=Institute fur Plastination, Statement on Wrongful Allegations and False Reports by Media on the Origin of Bodies in BODY WORLDS Exhibitions, press release |publisher=Pressemeldinger.no |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Harris, director of North Carolina's State Board of Funeral Services, has stated, "Somebody at some level of government ought to be able to look at a death certificate, a statement from an embalmer, donation documents... That's a reasonable standard to apply."&lt;ref&gt;[http://jscms.jrn.columbia.edu/cns/2006-02-28/winter-bodyexhibits/ Body exhibits titillate, but are they legal? — JSCMS] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224010254/http://jscms.jrn.columbia.edu/cns/2006-02-28/winter-bodyexhibits/ |date=24 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Assemblywoman Fiona Ma (D-San Francisco) said, "These displays do have important educational benefits, but using bodies against a person's will is unacceptable".&lt;ref name="californiachronicle.com"/&gt;

Questions raised regarding deceased hospital patients from [[Kyrgyzstan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bodyworlds.com/Downloads/E_Kirgisien%20AW%20GVH%202.pdf |title=Kirghisien No Skeletons in the Closet — Facts, Background and Conclusions: A response to the alleged corpse scandals in Novosibirsk, Russia, and Bishkek, Kyrgizstan |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327110115/http://www.bodyworlds.com/Downloads/E_Kirgisien%20AW%20GVH%202.pdf |archivedate=27 March 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and executed prisoners from [[China]] – were categorically stated to have never been used in a Body Worlds exhibition, according to BodyWorlds. "Five years ago, customs officers intercepted 56 bodies and hundreds of brain samples sent from the Novosibirsk Medical Academy to von Hagens' lab in Heidelberg, Germany. The cadavers were traced to a Russian medical examiner who was convicted last year of illegally selling the bodies of homeless people, prisoners and indigent hospital patients. Von Hagens was not charged with any wrongdoing, and says his cadavers are obtained only through proper legal and ethical channels.&lt;ref name="npr.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5637687|title=Origins of Exhibited Cadavers Questioned|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An Ethical Commission set up by the [[California Science Center]] in Los Angeles in 2004 had the following members: 
Reverend Richard Benson, Assistant Prof of Moral Theology and Academic Dean, 
St. John's Seminar, Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles;
David C. Blake, PhD, JD, VP, Mission and Ethics,
Saint John's Health Center;
Rabbi Morley Feinstein,
Senior Rabbi, University Synagogue;
Reverend Leonard Jackson,
Associate Minister,
First African Methodist Episcopal Church (First AME). 
They determined that 
"All the bodies need to be properly donated. Advisors felt that this is the most controversial aspect of the project. Proper body donation should be verified to the Science Center's satisfaction, and involves several components. Several advisors reviewed the Body Donor and felt it should be reviewed to ensure that it meets an adequate standard of disclosure and informed consent. They recommended that the form should be clear to make sure the bodies in the exhibit consented to public display. The source of donated bodies should be verifiable; Ask an independent party to review donor forms, verifying that all bodies are donated properly.; Communicate to guests, near the entrance of the exhibit, that the bodies are donated."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bodyworlds.com/Downloads/englisch/Media/Press%20Kit/BW_LA_SummaryofEthicalReview.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=25 February 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110115125640/http://www.bodyworlds.com/Downloads/englisch/Media/Press%20Kit/BW_LA_SummaryofEthicalReview.pdf |archive-date=15 January 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bodyworlds.com/Downloads/englisch/Media/Press%20Kit/BW_LA_SummaryofEthicalReview.pdf |title=Body Worlds: An Anatomical Exhibition of Real Human Bodies Summary of Ethical Review 2004/2005 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an ethical concern, consent is not regulated worldwide according to the same ethics. "That paperwork is then separated from the bodies, which can be used for displays or sold in pieces to medical schools. No one will know for sure, because each plastinated corpse is made anonymous to protect its privacy."&lt;ref name="npr.org"/&gt; Hans Martin Sass, a philosophy professor with a speciality in ethics, was hired by the California Science Center to investigate Body Worlds before the show's U.S. debut in 2004. He matched over 200 donation forms to death certificates, but he did not match the paperwork to specific bodies von Hagens has on display.&lt;ref name="npr.org"/&gt;

===Import law concerns===
International trade experts have objected to the way in which bodies for commercial display are imported, because the way their categorization codes (as "art collections") do not require [[Centers for Disease Control]] stamps or death certificates, both of which are required for medical cadavers.&lt;ref&gt;Television broadcast: Channel 3SAT, 1 May 2000,"Die Leichenshow" ("The Cadaver Show")&lt;/ref&gt; In most countries plastinated human specimens are classified under Customs Classification Code 97050000.48 "items in anatomical collections". This customs code encompasses "zoological, botanical, mineralogical or anatomical collections or items in such collections."&lt;ref&gt;Warenverzeichnis für die Außenhandelsstatistik (List of goods for statistics on exports), 1998 Edition of the Federal Bureau of Statistics.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethical concerns about cadaver displays===
In an ethical analysis, Thomas Hibbs, professor of ethics and culture at [[Baylor University]], a private [[Baptist]]-affiliated institution, compared cadaver displays to pornography, in that they reduce the subject to "the manipulation of body parts stripped of any larger human significance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=eResources, http://www.eResources.com |url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/archive/15/soa/bodyworlds.htm |title=A Journal of Technology and Society – Dead Body Porn – Thomas S. Hibbs |publisher=The New Atlantis |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905170629/http://www.thenewatlantis.com/archive/15/soa/bodyworlds.htm |archivedate=5 September 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2006 lecture entitled "Plasti-Nation: How America was Won",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Plasti-Nation: How America Was Won |url=http://blog.lib.umn.edu/sphpod/sphpod/2006/07/plastination_how_america_was_w_1.html |title=Public Lectures: Plasti-Nation: How America Was Won Archives |publisher=Blog.lib.umn.edu |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100628063801/http://blog.lib.umn.edu/sphpod/sphpod/2006/07/plastination_how_america_was_w_1.html |archivedate=28 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lucia Tanassi, professor of medical ethics and anthropology at [[Vanderbilt University Medical Center]], explored questions for ethicists regarding this new scientific frontier. Tanassi called it provocative that ethics committees have contributed to the popularization of the exhibits without setting forth any process of a line of inquiry, pointing to an ethics report from the California Science Center. As part of that review, bioethicist Hans Martin Sass was sent to Heidelberg to match donor consents with death certificates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5637687 |title=Origins of Exhibited Cadavers Questioned |publisher=NPR |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerns have been expressed about the educational aspects, especially the inclusion of these displays for school field trips. St. Louis Diocese Archbishop Raymond Burke strongly suggested that Catholic Schools avoid scheduling field trips, stating that parents, and not children, should retain the freedom of deciding whether or not their children will view the exhibit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myfoxstl.com/myfox/pages/News/Detail?contentId=4201800&amp;version=1&amp;locale=EN-US&amp;layoutCode=TSTY&amp;pageId=3.2.1 |title=St. Louis Ticket Broker &amp;#124; St Louis Cardinals &amp; St Louis Blues Tickets &amp;#124; Mizzou Football Tickets from The Ticket Guys |publisher=Myfoxstl.com |date= |accessdate=27 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080623080125/http://www.myfoxstl.com/myfox/pages/News/Detail?contentId=4201800&amp;version=1&amp;locale=EN-US&amp;layoutCode=TSTY&amp;pageId=3.2.1 |archivedate=23 June 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerned with how "some kids process" these "graphic" images, Des McKay, school superintendent in [[Abbotsford, British Columbia|Abbotsford]], British Columbia (near [[Greater Vancouver]]), barred field trips to exhibits of plasticized human beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vancouver |first=The |url=http://www.canada.com/theprovince/news/story.html?id=f89ece3d-f0e0-4d55-aa2e-746a9fcd9079&amp;k=63910 |title=Abbotsford schools barred from taking ghoulish field trip |publisher=Canada.com |date=1 October 2006 |accessdate=25 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208231942/http://www2.canada.com/theprovince/news/story.html?id=f89ece3d-f0e0-4d55-aa2e-746a9fcd9079&amp;k=63910 |archivedate=8 February 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an editorial to the Abbotsford News, Rev. Christoph Reiners questions what effect the exhibits will have on the values of children attending for school field trips.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dignityinboston.googlepages.com/bodyworldsobjectifieshumanity dignity in Boston – Body worlds objectifies humanity] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304155233/http://dignityinboston.googlepages.com/bodyworldsobjectifieshumanity |date=4 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others—such as the Catholic Schools Office of Phoenix—acknowledge the educational content of Body Worlds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Phelan |first=Mike |url=http://www.catholicsun.org/2007/feb15/local/bodyworlds.html |title=Phoenix Diocesan Newspaper |publisher=The Catholic Sun |date=15 February 2007 |accessdate=25 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100205020019/http://www.catholicsun.org/2007/feb15/local/bodyworlds.html |archivedate=5 February 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reporting on the exhibition at the O2 bubble in 2008/2009, Melanie Reid of The Times stated "(Body Worlds) should be compulsory viewing for every child of 10 or over"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/melanie_reid/article5002781.ece Melanie Reid, The Times: Not gory, not scary, just fascinating] Retrieved 19 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Press limitations===
Von Hagens maintains [[copyright]] control over pictures of his exhibits. Visitors are not allowed to take pictures, and press photographers are required to sign agreements permitting only a single publication in a defined context, followed by a return of the copyright to Von Hagens. Because of a similar agreement applied to sound bites (O-Töne, in German) a German press organization suggested that the press refrain from reporting about the exhibition in Munich in 2003 .&lt;ref&gt;Keine O-Töne über Körperwelten [http://www.djv.de/SingleNews.20+M532fe2eeb51.0.html Pressemitteilung, Deutscher Journalisten-Verband, 25 August 2003] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718231505/http://www.djv.de/SingleNews.20+M532fe2eeb51.0.html# |date=18 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Selling plastinates===
The Body Worlds website offers plastinated pieces for sale. There are a wide range of products from plastinated fruit jewelry to entire humans. Although some of the pieces require purchasers to be a qualified user—those intending to use the pieces for "research, educational, medical or therapeutic purposes"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Donating Your Body For Plastination|url=http://www.bodymobil.de/Downloads/Deutsch/Downloads/Brosch/BD_Brochure_EN_EU08_240613.pdf|publisher=Institute for Plastination|accessdate=24 May 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140525232216/http://www.bodymobil.de/Downloads/Deutsch/Downloads/Brosch/BD_Brochure_EN_EU08_240613.pdf|archivedate=25 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;—many pieces, including animal testicles and baby chicks, require no authorization. There are also extremely realistic plastinate impressions of human hearts and slices (including one slice of copulating humans) for sale to the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plastination-products.com/Blood-vessel-configuration/Human-blood-vessel-configuration/Hearts/Human-heart-natural::1239.html |title=Menschliches Herz; natürlich – von Hagens Onlineshop |publisher=Plastination-products.com |date= |accessdate=27 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Competitors ==
The success of Body Worlds has given rise to several similar shows featuring plastinated cadavers, including ''[[BODIES... The Exhibition]]'' and ''Our Body: The Universe Within'' in the [[United States]], ''[[Bodies Revealed]]'' in the [[United Kingdom]], ''Body Exploration'' in the [[Republic of China]], ''Mysteries of the Human Body'' in [[South Korea]], ''[[Jintai Plastomic]]: Mysteries of the Human Body'' in [[Japan]], ''Cuerpos Entrañables'' in [[Spain]].

Some of these contain exhibits very similar to von Hagens' plastinates; Von Hagens has asserted copyright protection, and has sued ''Body Exploration'' and ''Bodies Revealed''.
The suits were based on a presumed copyright of certain positions of the bodies, but the [[counterparty]] asserts that the human body in its diversity cannot be copyrighted.

Such lawsuits&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1145538532408 |title=Body Exhibits Attract Suits on Contracts, Copyrights |publisher=Law.com |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; have not stopped the competition. While the Korean police in Seoul confiscated a few exhibits from ''Bodies Revealed'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bodiesrevealed.com/korean-times.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327110112/http://www.bodiesrevealed.com/korean-times.pdf |date=27 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the exhibition went on successfully.

Several of the competing exhibitions have been organized by the publicly traded US company [[Premier Exhibitions]]. They started their first ''Bodies Revealed'' exhibition in [[Blackpool, England]] which ran from August through October 2004. In 2005 and 2006 the company opened their ''Bodies Revealed'' and ''BODIES... The Exhibition'' exhibitions in Seoul, Tampa, Miami, New York City, and Seattle. Other exhibition sites in 2006 are Mexico City, Atlanta (GA), London, Great Britain and Las Vegas (Nevada).

Unlike Body Worlds, none of the competing exhibitions or their suppliers have a body donation programme. Dr. Roy Glover, a spokesperson for ''BODIES... The Exhibition'' said all their exhibits use unclaimed cadavers, deposited at the University of Dalian by Chinese authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5637687 |title=NPR Origins of Exhibited Cadavers Questioned |publisher=Npr.org |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2008, a settlement with the attorney general of New York obliged Premier Exhibitions to offer refunds to visitors when it could not prove consent for the use of the bodies in its exhibitions. New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo commented: "Despite repeated denials, we now know that Premier itself cannot demonstrate the circumstances that led to the death of the individuals. Nor is Premier able to establish that these people consented to their remains being used in this manner."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Cuomo Settlement With 'Bodies...

'''Borderless selling''' is the process of [[selling]] services to clients outside the country of origin of services through modern methods which eliminate the actions specifically designed to hinder [[international trade]]. International trade through "borderless selling" is a new phenomenon born in the current "[[globalization]]" era.

==Definitions==
'''Borderless selling''' is defined as the process of performing [[sales]] transaction between two or more parties from different countries (an [[exporter]] and an [[importer]]) which is free from actions specifically designed to hinder [[international trade]], such as [[tariff barrier]]s, [[currency restriction]]s, and [[import quota]]s.

==Background==
[[International trade]] which is the exchange of goods and services across international borders has been present throughout much of history of [[economics]], [[society]] and [[politics]]. 

It is assumed that [[offshore outsourcing]] gave birth to "borderless selling". The selling of services by [[offshore outsourcing]] service providers to foreign clients is free from actions specifically designed to hinder international trade, such as tariff barriers, currency restrictions, and import quotas. This is largely because most of the services are sold or delivered electronically from the offshore service provider to the foreign client. This phenomenon gave birth to borderless selling.

There is a high correlation between outsourcing and exporting activity. However, borderless selling is different from free international trade or selling. Under the belief in [[Mercantilism]], most nations had high tariffs and many restrictions on international trade for centuries. In the 19th century, a belief in free trade became paramount in west, especially in Britain and this outlook has since then dominated the thinking of [[western nations]]. Traditionally international trade was possible between only those countries which regulated international trade through [[bilateral treaty|bilateral treaties]]. Borderless selling is possible between any two countries of the world because services can be exported using modern telecommunication networks without the need to regulate trade.

The "borderless selling" term was originated as part of the research carried out by team led by Paramjeev Singh Sethi.

'''''Bully for Brontosaurus''''' (1991) is the fifth volume of collected [[essay]]s by the [[Harvard University|Harvard]] [[paleontology|paleontologist]] [[Stephen Jay Gould]]. The essays were culled from his monthly column "This View of Life" in ''[[Natural History (magazine)|Natural History]]'' magazine, to which Gould contributed for 27 years. The book deals, in typically discursive fashion, with themes familiar to Gould's writing: evolution and its teaching, science biography, and probabilities.
[[File:Pasta-Brontosaurus.jpg|thumb|left|''Brontosaurus'' restoration by [[Charles R. Knight]] which was used for the cover]]
The title essay, "Bully for Brontosaurus", discusses the theory and history of taxonomy by examining the debate over whether ''[[Brontosaurus]]'' should be labelled ''[[Apatosaurus]]''. In "Justice Scalia's Misunderstanding", Gould dissects and decisively rejects [[Antonin Scalia]]'s dissent in the [[United States Supreme Court]] case ''[[Edwards v. Aguillard]]'' that overturned the last [[creationist]] statute in the country. Gould claimed his favourite essay to be "In a Jumbled Drawer" which discusses the debate between [[Nathaniel Shaler]] and [[William James]] over whether the improbability of our having evolved necessitates divine intervention (Gould, like James, argues no); the essay includes a letter from former President [[Jimmy Carter]] as a postscript, which discusses the issue.

The essay "Male Nipples and Clitoral Ripples" dealt with the issue of adaptive arguments. It derives from some work by [[Elisabeth Lloyd]], whose subsequent 2005 book&lt;ref name="caseofthefemaleorgasm"&gt;Lloyd, E.A. (2005). ''The Case of The Female Orgasm: Bias in the science of evolution''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press&lt;/ref&gt; was dedicated to Gould (and her parents), and uses the case of the female orgasm to expand on the subject of adaptiveness in both depth and breadth.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6797">'''CEASE''' (Complete Elimination of Autistic Spectrum Expression) therapy is used by [[Naturopathy|naturopaths]] (particularly [[Homeopathy|homeopaths]]) who claim, without evidence, that it can treat or even cure people with [[autism]]. It involves a mixture of supplements, high-dose vitamin C, 'orthomolecular support', dietary restrictions and [[homeopathy]] and was developed by the late Tinus Smits - a Dutch doctor. Smits claimed to have used it to treat over 300 children with autism. The therapy became more notable in 2017/2018 because of regulatory action taken by professional bodies in The Netherlands, UK and Canada following a series of complaints about unfounded claims. 

Smits in the book "Autism Beyond Despair - CEASE Therapy"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/654303657|title=Autism : beyond despair : CEASE therapy|last=Tinus.|first=Smits,|date=2010|publisher=Emryss Publishers|others=Owens, Tim.|isbn=9076189285|location=[Haarlem, The Netherlands]|oclc=654303657}}&lt;/ref&gt; stated that autistic children should never be vaccinated.   

In October 2017 the Dutch Advertising Code Foundation (Stichting Reclame Code) found that the official website for CEASE therapy was in breach of advertising regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reclamecode.nl/webuitspraak.asp?ID=199321&amp;acCode|title=2017/00594|publisher=Stichting Reclame|date=3 October 2017|accessdate=13 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=UK Homeopathy Regulation: More on CEASE Therapy |url=http://ukhomeopathyregulation.blogspot.com/2017/10/more-on-cease-therapy.html |website=UK Homeopathy Regulation |accessdate=14 July 2018 |date=24 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, the [[Professional Standards Authority for Health and Social Care|Professional Standards Authority]] (PSA) placed some requirements on the Society of Homeopaths (SoH) when they reaccredited their members' register under their Accredited Register scheme, due to concerns about the way in which members marketed CEASE therapy. The PSA asked the SoH to confirm "what action it will take to ensure children are safe as a condition of its re-accreditation".&lt;ref name=CEASE120homeopaths&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/apr/27/more-than-120-homeopaths-trying-to-cure-autism-in-uk|title=More than 120 homeopaths trying to ‘cure’ autism in UK|publisher=The Guardian|date=27 April 2018|accessdate=13 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2018 the Society of Homeopaths published a position statement advising their members not to imply any cure of autism when marketing CEASE therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180715064408/https://homeopathy-soh.org/society-publishes-position-statement-on-cease/|title=Society publishes position statement on CEASE|publisher=Society of Homeopaths|date=1 June 2018|accessdate=13 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been estimated that more than 120 homeopaths are offering CEASE in the UK though not all are SoH members.&lt;ref name=CEASE120homeopaths /&gt; In July 2015 the UK's [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] (ASA) found Teddington Homeopathy's marketing of CEASE therapy in breach of the Advertising Standards Code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/teddington-homeopathy-a15-299143.html|title=ASA Ruling on Teddington Homeopathy|publisher=Advertising Standards Authority|date=22 July 2015|accessdate=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following month the ASA added the company to its list of [https://www.asa.org.uk/codes-and-rulings/non-compliant-online-advertisers.html non-compliant online advertisers] for "making unproven efficacy claims for CEASE therapy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.asa.org.uk/non-compliant/teddington-homeopathy.html|title=Teddington Homeopathy|publisher=Advertising Standards Authority|date=27 August 2015|accessdate=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In July 2018 the ASA upheld an adjudication against Bubbling Life's website, determining that the claims relating to CEASE, vaccination, autism and [[Autism_spectrum|ASD]] could discourage customers from seeking appropriate advice or treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/elle-fox--a18-443476.html|title=ASA Ruling on Bubbling Life|date=18 July 2018|accessdate=25 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[British Columbia]], Canada, the Board of the College of Naturopathic Physicians investigated three CEASE practitioners &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/homeopathy-for-autism-certainly-not-based-on-science-b-c-health-official-says-1.4677128|title=Homeopathy for autism 'certainly not based on science,' B.C. health official says|publisher=CBC News|date=25 May 2018|accessdate=13 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; following complaints from the public and subsequently "determined that naturopathic doctors in British Columbia must not advertise or offer CEASE therapy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/naturopath-college-outlaws-therapy-promising-complete-elimination-of-autism-1.4682714|title=Naturopath college outlaws therapy that promises 'complete elimination' of autism|publisher=CBC News|date=29 May 2018 |accessdate=13 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as this prohibition the College's updated position statements also clarify that naturopathic doctors in BC must not offer anti-vaccination materials or advice (including on social media) and must not imply that vaccination causes autism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnpbc.bc.ca/changes-to-the-colleges-immunization-standard-and-prohibition-of-cease-therapy-2/|title=Changes to the College’s Immunization Standard and prohibition of CEASE therapy|publisher=College of Naturopathic Physicians of British Columbia|accessdate=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Center for Open Science''' is a [[non-profit]] technology organization based in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]] with a mission to "increase the openness, integrity, and [[reproducibility]] of scientific research."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Center for Open Science|url=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HWJxPkyuMo49uzhEsvK5HxhyrSFR3Ys625NqHY3zmsk|work=Business Plan|accessdate=11 July 2013|date=Jan 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brian Nosek]] and  Jeffrey Spies founded the organization in January 2013, funded mainly by the [[Laura and John Arnold Foundation]] and others, after implementation and use of the [[Open Science Framework]] (OSF).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cos.io/about/our-sponsors/|title=Our Sponsors|website=cos.io|language=en|access-date=2017-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Open Science Framework==
The Open Science Framework (OSF) is an [[Open-source software|open source]] software project that facilitates open collaboration in science research. This framework was used to work on a project in the reproducibility of psychology research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Estes|first=Sarah|title=The Myth of Self-Correcting Science|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2012/12/the-myth-of-self-correcting-science/266228/|accessdate=11 July 2013|newspaper=The Atlantic|date=20 Dec 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Yong|first=Ed|title=Nature|url=http://www.nature.com/news/replication-studies-bad-copy-1.10634|publisher=Nature|accessdate=11 July 2013|date=16 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current reproducibility project is a crowdsourced empirical investigation of the reproducibility of a variety of studies from psychological literature. The reproducibility project samples from three major journals: ''[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]]'', ''[[Psychological Science]]'', and ''[[Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Do normative scientific practices and incentive structures produce a biased body of research evidence?|url=https://osf.io/ezcuj/wiki/home/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists from all over the world volunteer to replicate a study of their choosing from these journals, and follow a structured protocol for designing and conducting a high-powered replication of the key effect.

'''Characterology''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|χαρακτήρ}} "character" and {{lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''[[-logy|-logia]]'') is a method of character reading that attempted to combine revised [[physiognomy]], reconstructed [[phrenology]] and amplified [[pathognomy]], with [[ethnology]], [[sociology]] and [[anthropology]].  Developed by [[L. Hamilton McCormick]] in the 1920s, characterology was an attempt to produce a scientific, objective system to assess an individual's character.

Characterology attempted to resolve flaws in the phrenological systems of [[Franz Joseph Gall]] 
and [[Johann Spurzheim]]. McCormick tried to distance himself from those earlier systems, and wrote extensively about how his ideas improved upon them.

McCormick suggested possible applications for characterology, e.g., advice for [[parent]]s and [[educator]]s, guidance in [[military]] officer promotions, evaluating [[thinking]] patterns (i.e., [[reason]]-oriented or [[memory]]-oriented ), assessing  business associates and competitors, career counseling, and selecting [[marriage|marital partners]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16620">{{short description|The principle that evidence from independent, unrelated sources can "converge" on strong conclusions}}
{{other uses}}

In [[science]] and [[history]], '''consilience''' (also '''convergence of evidence''' or '''concordance of evidence''') refers to the principle that [[evidence]] from independent, unrelated sources can "converge" on strong conclusions. That is, when multiple sources of evidence are in agreement, the conclusion can be very strong even when none of the individual sources of evidence is significantly so on its own. Most established scientific knowledge is supported by a convergence of evidence: if not, the evidence is comparatively weak, and there will not likely be a strong [[scientific consensus]].

The principle is based on the [[unity of knowledge]]; measuring the same result by several different methods should lead to the same answer. For example, it should not matter whether one measures the distance between the [[Giza pyramid complex]] by [[Laser rangefinder|laser rangefinding]], by [[satellite imaging]], or with a [[meter stick]] – in all three cases, the answer should be approximately the same. For the same reason, different dating methods in [[geochronology]] should concur, a result in [[chemistry]] should not contradict a result in [[geology]], etc.

The word ''consilience'' was originally coined as the phrase "consilience of inductions" by [[William Whewell]] ("consilience" refers to a "jumping together" of knowledge).&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Wilson|first=Edward O|title= Consilience: the unity of knowledge|year=1998|publisher=[[Alfred A. Knopf|Knopf]]|location= New York|isbn= 978-0-679-45077-1|oclc= 36528112}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shermer"&gt;
{{cite book|first=Michael |last=Shermer|year=2000|title=Denying History: Who says the Holocaust never happened and why do they say it?|publisher=University of California Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word comes from [[Latin]] ''com-'' "together" and ''-siliens'' "jumping" (as in resilience).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=consilience consilience] ''Online etymology dictionary''. Accessed: 17 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

Consilience requires the use of independent methods of measurement, meaning that the methods have few shared characteristics. That is, the mechanism by which the measurement is made is different; each method is dependent on an unrelated natural phenomenon. For example, the accuracy of laser rangefinding measurements is based on the scientific understanding of [[laser]]s, while satellite pictures and meter sticks rely on different phenomena. Because the methods are independent, when one of several methods is in error, it is very unlikely to be in error in the ''same way'' as any of the other methods, and a difference between the measurements will be observed.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Note that this is not the same as performing the same measurement several times. While repetition does provide evidence because it shows that the measurement is being performed consistently, it would not be consilience and would be more vulnerable to error.&lt;/ref&gt; If the scientific understanding of the properties of lasers were inaccurate, then the laser measurement would be inaccurate but the others would not.

As a result, when several different methods agree, this is strong evidence that ''none'' of the methods are in error and the conclusion is correct. This is because of a greatly reduced likelihood of errors: for a consensus estimate from multiple measurements to be wrong, the errors would have to be similar for all samples and all methods of measurement, which is extremely unlikely. [[Random errors]] will tend to cancel out as more measurements are made, due to [[regression to the mean]]; [[systematic errors]] will be detected by differences between the measurements (and will also tend to cancel out since the direction of the error will still be random). This is how [[Scientific theory|scientific theories]] reach high confidence – over time, they build up a large degree of evidence which converges on the same conclusion.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Statistically, if three different tests are each 90% reliable when they give a positive result, a positive result from all three tests would be 99.9% reliable; five such tests would be 99.999% reliable, and so forth. This requires the tests to be [[statistically independent]], analogous to the requirement for independence in the methods of measurement.&lt;/ref&gt;

When results from different strong methods do appear to conflict, this is treated as a serious problem to be reconciled. For example, in the 19th century, the [[Sun]] appeared to be no more than 20 million years old, but the Earth appeared to be no less than 300 million years (resolved by the discovery of [[nuclear fusion]] and [[radioactivity]], and the theory of [[quantum mechanics]]);&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/articles/fusion/#1 John N. Bahcall, nobelprize.org]&lt;/ref&gt; or current attempts to resolve theoretical differences between quantum mechanics and [[general relativity]].&lt;ref name=Weinberg&gt;
{{cite book|last=Weinberg|first= S|year=1993|title=Dreams of a Final Theory: The Scientist's Search for the Ultimate Laws of Nature|publisher=Vintage Books, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==

Because of consilience, the strength of evidence for any particular conclusion is related to how many independent methods are supporting the conclusion, as well as how different these methods are. Those techniques with the fewest (or no) shared characteristics provide the strongest consilience and result in the strongest conclusions. This also means that confidence is usually strongest when considering evidence from different fields, because the techniques are usually very different.

For example, the theory of [[evolution]] is supported by a convergence of evidence from [[genetics]], [[molecular biology]], [[paleontology]], [[geology]], [[biogeography]], [[comparative anatomy]], [[comparative physiology]], and many other fields.&lt;ref name="SciAm"&gt;''Scientific American'', March 2005. "The Fossil Fallacy." [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-fossil-fallacy Link.]&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the evidence within each of these fields is itself a convergence providing evidence for the theory. (As a result, to disprove evolution, most or all of these independent lines of evidence would have to be found to be in error.&lt;ref name="Shermer" /&gt;) The strength of the evidence, considered together as a whole, results in the strong scientific consensus that the theory is correct.&lt;ref name="SciAm"/&gt; In a similar way, evidence about the [[history of the universe]] is drawn from astronomy, astrophysics, planetary geology, and physics.&lt;ref name="Shermer" /&gt;

Finding similar conclusions from multiple independent methods is also evidence for the reliability of the methods themselves, because consilience eliminates the possibility of all potential errors that do not affect all the methods equally. This is also used for the validation of new techniques through comparison with the consilient ones. If only partial consilience is observed, this allows for the detection of errors in methodology; any weaknesses in one technique can be compensated for by the strengths of the others. Alternatively, if using more than one or two techniques for every experiment is infeasible, some of the benefits of consilience may still be obtained if it is well-established that these techniques usually give the same result.

Consilience is important across all of science, including the social sciences,&lt;ref&gt;For example, in linguistics: see ''Converging Evidence: Methodological and theoretical issues for linguistic research, edited by Doris Schonefeld.'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=nGKT-2VwO0UC&amp;pg=PT92&amp;dq=Converging+Evidence&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ipfuT_jrOIjpqAHnrp2OAg&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Converging%20Evidence&amp;f=false Link.]&lt;/ref&gt; and is often used as an argument for [[scientific realism]] by philosophers of science. Each branch of science studies a subset of reality that depends on factors studied in other branches. [[Atomic physics]] underlies the workings of [[chemistry]], which studies [[emergence|emergent]] properties that in turn are the basis of [[biology]]. [[Psychology]] is not separate from the study of properties emergent from the interaction of [[neuron]]s and [[synapse]]s. [[Sociology]], [[economics]], and [[anthropology]] are each, in turn, studies of properties emergent from the interaction of countless individual humans. The concept that all the different areas of research are studying one real, existing universe is an apparent explanation of why scientific knowledge determined in one field of inquiry has often helped in understanding other fields.

==Deviations==

Consilience does not forbid deviations: in fact, since not all experiments are perfect, some deviations from established knowledge are expected. However, when the convergence is strong enough, then new evidence inconsistent with the previous conclusion is not usually enough to outweigh that convergence. Without an equally strong convergence on the new result, the weight of evidence will still favor the established result. This means that the new evidence is most likely to be wrong.

Science [[denialism]] (for example, [[HIV/AIDS denialism|AIDS denialism]]) is often based on a misunderstanding of this property of consilience. A denier may promote small gaps not yet accounted for by the consilient evidence, or small amounts of evidence contradicting a conclusion without accounting for the pre-existing strength resulting from consilience. More generally, to insist that all evidence converge precisely with no deviations would be naïve falsificationism,&lt;ref name="Lakatos"&gt;For example, see [http://www.inf.fu-berlin.de/lehre/pmo/eng/Lakatos-Falsification.pdf Imre Lakatos.], in ''Criticism and the Growth of Knowledge'' (1970).&lt;/ref&gt; equivalent to considering a single contrary result to [[Falsifiability|falsify]] a theory when another explanation, such as equipment malfunction or misinterpretation of results, is much more likely.&lt;ref name="Lakatos"/&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;More generally, anything which results in a false positive or false negative.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In history==

Historical evidence also converges in an analogous way. For example: if five ancient historians, none of whom knew each other, all claim that [[Julius Caesar]] seized power in Rome in 49 BCE, this is strong evidence in favor of that event occurring even if each individual historian is only partially reliable. By contrast, if the same historian had made the same claim five times in five different places (and no other types of evidence were available), the claim is much weaker because it originates from a single source. The evidence from the ancient historians could also converge with evidence from other fields, such as archaeology: for example, evidence that many senators fled Rome at the time, that the battles of [[Caesar’s civil war]] occurred, and so forth.

Consilience has also been discussed in reference to [[Holocaust denial]]. 
{{quote|"We [have now discussed] eighteen proofs all converging on one conclusion...the deniers shift the burden of proof to historians by demanding that ''each'' piece of evidence, independently and without corroboration between them, prove the Holocaust. Yet no historian has ever claimed that one piece of evidence proves the Holocaust. We must examine the collective whole."&lt;ref name="Shermer" /&gt;}}

That is, individually the evidence may underdetermine the conclusion, but together they overdetermine it. A similar way to state this is that to ask for one ''particular'' piece of evidence in favor of a conclusion is a flawed question.&lt;ref name="SciAm"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shermer2"&gt;{{cite book|first=Michael|last= Shermer|year=2002|title=In Darwin’s Shadow: The Life and Science of Alfred Russel Wallace|page=319|publisher=Oxford University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gSSkPqmbeXIC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outside the sciences==

In addition to the sciences, consilience can be important to [[the arts]], [[ethics]] and [[religion]]. Both artists and scientists have identified the importance of biology in the process of artistic innovation.&lt;ref name=Wilson /&gt;

==History of the concept==
Consilience has its roots in the ancient [[Greek philosophy|Greek concept]] of an [[Intrinsic and extrinsic properties|intrinsic]] orderliness that governs our [[cosmos]], inherently comprehensible by logical process, a vision at odds with [[mystical]] views in many cultures that surrounded the Hellenes. The [[Rationality|rational]] view was recovered during the high [[Middle Ages]], separated from [[theology]] during the [[Renaissance]] and found its apogee in the [[Age of Enlightenment]].&lt;ref name="Wilson" /&gt;

Whewell’s definition was that:&lt;ref name="Whewell"&gt;{{cite book|first=William|last= Whewell|year=1840|title=The Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences, Founded Upon Their History|publisher=London: John W. Parker|url=https://archive.org/details/philosinductsci01wewrich|volume=2 vols}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The Consilience of Inductions takes place when an [[inductive reasoning|Induction]], obtained from one class of facts, coincides with an Induction obtained from another different class.  Thus Consilience is a test of the truth of the Theory in which it occurs.}}

More recent descriptions include:
{{quote|"Where there is convergence of evidence, where the same explanation is implied, there is increased confidence in the explanation. Where there is divergence, then either the explanation is at fault or one or more of the sources of information is in error or requires reinterpretation."&lt;ref&gt;''A Companion to the Philosophy of History and Historiography'', section 28. Aviezer Tucker (editor).&lt;/ref&gt;}}
{{quote|"Proof is derived through a convergence of evidence from numerous lines of inquiry--multiple, independent inductions, all of which point to an unmistakable conclusion."&lt;ref name="SciAm"/&gt;}}

==Edward O. Wilson==
Although the concept of consilience in Whewell's sense was widely discussed by philosophers of science, the term was unfamiliar to the broader public until the end of the 20th century, when it was revived in ''[[Consilience (book)|Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge]],'' a 1998 book by the humanist biologist [[Edward Osborne Wilson]], as an attempt to bridge the culture gap between the sciences and the humanities that was the subject of [[C. P. Snow]]'s ''[[The Two Cultures|The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution]]'' (1959).&lt;ref name="Wilson" /&gt;

Wilson held that with the rise of the [[modern science]]s, the sense of unity gradually was lost in the increasing fragmentation and specialization of knowledge in the last two centuries. He asserted that the sciences, humanities, and arts have a common goal: to give a purpose to understanding the details, to lend to all inquirers "a conviction, far deeper than a mere working proposition, that the world is orderly and can be explained by a small number of natural laws." And important point made by Wilson is that hereditary human nature and evolution itself profoundly effect the evolution of culture, in essence a sociobiological concept. Wilson's concept is a much broader notion of consilience than that of Whewell, who was merely pointing out that generalizations invented to account for one set of phenomena often account for others as well.&lt;ref name="Wilson" /&gt;

A parallel view lies in the term [[universology]], which literally means "the science of the universe." Universology was first promoted for the study of the interconnecting principles and truths of all domains of knowledge by [[Stephen Pearl Andrews]], a 19th-century utopian futurist and anarchist.&lt;ref name="Wilson" /&gt;

A '''crop circle''' or '''crop formation''' is a pattern created by flattening a [[crop]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/crop-circle?q=crop+circle|title=crop circle - Definition of crop circle in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English}}&lt;/ref&gt; usually a [[cereal]]. The term was first coined in the early 1980s by Colin Andrews.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Andrews, Pat Delgado ''Circular Evidence: A Detailed Investigation of the Flattened Swirled Crops''. Phanes Press, 1991. {{ISBN|0-7475-0635-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crop circles have been described as all falling "within the range of the sort of thing done in [[hoax]]es" by [[Taner Edis]], professor of physics at [[Truman State University]].&lt;ref&gt;Edis, Taner. ''Science and Nonbelief''. Prometheus Books. 2008, p. 138. {{ISBN|1-59102-561-3}} "Skeptics begin by pointing out that many paranormal claims are the result of fraud or hoaxes. Crop circles—elaborate patterns that appear on fields overnight—appear to be of this sort. Many crop circle makers have come forth or have been exposed.

Many true believers remain who continue to think there is something paranormal—perhaps alien—about crop circles. But the circles we know all fall within the range of the sort of thing done in hoaxes. Nothing stands out as extraordinary."&lt;/ref&gt; Although obscure natural causes or [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] origins of crop circles are suggested by [[Fringe theory|fringe theorists]],&lt;ref name="parker2000human"&gt;{{cite journal|

The number of crop circles has substantially increased from the 1970s to current times. There has been little scientific study of them. Circles in the United Kingdom are not distributed randomly across the landscape but appear near roads, areas of medium to dense population and cultural heritage monuments, such as [[Stonehenge]] or [[Avebury]].&lt;ref name="northcote"&gt;{{cite web |author= Jeremy Northcote |url= http://www.siue.edu/GEOGRAPHY/ONLINE/Northcote06.pdf |title= Spatial distribution of England's crop circles |journal= Geography Online |publisher= [[Southern Illinois University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, two hoaxers, Bower and Chorley, took credit for having created many circles throughout England after one of their circles was described by a circle investigator as impossible to be made by human hand.&lt;ref name="nyt1991"/&gt;

Formations are usually created overnight,&lt;ref name="Taylor2011"/&gt; although some are reported to have appeared during the day.{{sfn|Margry &amp; Roodenburg|2007|pages= 140–42}} In contrast to crop circles or crop formations, archaeological remains can cause [[cropmark]]s in the fields in the shapes of circles and squares, but they do not appear overnight, and they are always in the same places every year.

== History ==

The concept of "crop circles" began with the original late-1970s hoaxes by Doug Bower and Dave Chorley (see [[#Bower and Chorley|Bower and Chorley]], below).&lt;ref name=dutch /&gt;&lt;ref name=skepticssa/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= [[The Demon-Haunted World]] |author= Carl Sagan |authorlink= Carl Sagan |year= 1997 |pages= 72–76|isbn= 0747251568 |publisher= [[Headline Publishing Group]] |ref= {{harvid|Sagan|1997}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NGEO"/&gt;&lt;ref name="smithsonian"&gt;{{cite web |author1= Rob Irving |author2= Peter Brookesmith |url= http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/Crop-Circles-The-Art-of-the-Hoax.html |title= Crop Circles: The Art of the Hoax |work= Smithsonian.com |date= December 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; They said that they were inspired by the [[Tully, Queensland|Tully]] "saucer nest" case in Australia, where a farmer claimed to first have seen a UFO, then found a flattened circle of swamp reeds.&lt;ref name=skepticssa/&gt;

=== Before the 20th century ===

A 1678 news pamphlet ''[[Mowing-Devil|The Mowing-Devil: or, Strange News Out of Hartfordshire]]'' is claimed by some cereologists to be the first depiction of a crop circle.&lt;ref name=dutch /&gt; Crop circle researcher Jim Schnabel does not consider it to be a historical precedent because it describes the stalks as being cut rather than bent&lt;ref name=dutch /&gt; (see [[#Folklore|folklore section]]).

In 1686, British [[naturalist]] [[Robert Plot]] reported on rings or arcs of mushrooms (see [[fairy ring]]s) in ''The Natural History of Stafford-Shire'' and proposed air flows from the sky as a cause.&lt;ref name=NatHist&gt;{{cite book |author= John Aubrey |url= http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04/nhwil10.txt |title= The Natural History of Stafford-Shire |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070402233131/http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04/nhwil10.txt |archivedate= 2 April 2007 |df= dmy-all }} at [[Project Gutenberg]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PhiloTrans&gt;{{cite journal |title= ''The Natural History of Staffordshire'' by Robert Plott; ''Sciotericum Telescopicum or a new Contrivance of adapting a Telescope to a Horizontall Diall, for observing the moment of time by day or night'' by Will Molineux |journal= Philosophical Transactions |volume= 16 (1686–1692) |jstor= 101866 |pages= 207–16 |department= Accounts of Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991 meteorologist Terence Meaden linked this report with modern crop circles, a claim that has been compared with those made by [[Erich von Däniken]].{{refn|group=n|Keving Greene wrote, &lt;blockquote&gt;The difficulties that exist in communicating the results of archaeology have undoubtedly contributed to the flourishing of writers, such as Erich von Däniken, who take a particular delight in deriding the inability of 'experts' to find explanations that seize the imagination of the public. (...) Few archaeologists have sold as many paperbacks as von Däniken; more recently, a meteorologist who linked crop circles to prehistoric ring-ditches or round barrows generated a reaction that no orthodox student of these monuments has ever achieved (Meaden 1991) [in reference to {{cite book |author= T.

An 1880 letter to the editor of ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' by amateur scientist [[John Rand Capron]] describes how a recent storm had created several circles of flattened crops in a field.{{refn|name="Capron1880"|group=n|John Rand Capron wrote, &lt;blockquote&gt;The storms about this part of Surrey have been lately local and violent, and the effects produced in some instances curious. Visiting a neighbour's farm on Wednesday evening (21st), we found a field of standing wheat considerably knocked about, not as an entirety, but in patches forming, as viewed from a distance, circular spots (...) they all presented much the same character, viz, a few standing stalks as a centre, some prostrate stalks with their heads arranged pretty evenly in a direction forming a circle round the centre, and outside there a circular wall of stalks which had not suffered. (...) I could not trace locally any circumstances accounting for the peculiar forms of the patches in the field, nor indicating whether it was wind or rain, or both combined, which had caused them, beyond the general evidence everywhere of heavy rainfall. They were suggestive to me of some cyclonic wind action, and may perhaps have been noticed elsewhere by some of your readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1038/022290d0 |bibcode= 1880Natur..22..290C |title= Storm Effects |url= http://www.iccra.org/Historical%20Research/Storm%20Effects_Nature_1880_J_Rand_Capron.pdf |year= 1880 |author= John Rand Capron |journal= Nature |volume= 22 |issue= 561 |page= [https://books.google.com/books?id=CJlFAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA290 290]}} Retrieved from {{cite web |title= Nature archive for the decade 1880–1889 |url= http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/currentdecade.html?decade=1880&amp;year=1880 |work= nature.com |publisher= Nature |accessdate= 23 August 2011}} Republished in {{cite journal |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=BGIdAQAAIAAJ |title= A case of genuine crop circles dating from July 1880 – as published in Nature in the year 1880 |journal= Journal of Meteorology |volume= 25 |pages= 20–21 |date=January 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}

=== 20th century ===
In 1932, archaeologist E C Curwen observed four dark rings in a field at Stoughton Down near Chichester, but could examine only one: "a circle in which the barley was 'lodged' or beaten down, while the interior area was very slightly mounded up."&lt;ref&gt;Sussex Notes and Queries, 1937 Eliot Cecil Curwen pp. 139–40&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, amateur astronomer [[Patrick Moore]] described a crater in a potato field in Wiltshire, which he considered was probably caused by an unknown meteoric body. In nearby wheat fields, there were several circular and elliptical areas where the wheat had been flattened. There was evidence of "spiral flattening". He thought they could be caused by air currents from the impact, since they led towards the crater.&lt;ref&gt;Moore P. ‘That Wiltshire Crater’ Letter to the editor ''New Scientist'' 8 August 1963
{{blockquote|1=In the adjoining wheatfields were other features, taking the form of circular or elliptical areas in which the wheat had been flattened. I saw these myself; they had not been much visited, and were certainly peculiar One, very well-defined, was an oval 15 yards long by 41 broad. There was evidence of "spiral flattening", and in one case there was a circular area in the centre in which the wheat had not been flattened. In no case was there any evidence of an actual depression in the ground.

(...) [The crater] could have been caused by natural subsidence, but it did not give that impression, and in any case there are the areas of flattened wheat to be taken into account; it would be remarkable coincidence if these areas were not associated with the crater. Since the areas of flattened wheat "led" to the crater, it looks very much as though they, and the crater, were caused by something which came from the sky. In this case, the wheat would have been flattened by violent air-currents produced by the falling body.}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Astronomer [[Hugh Ernest Butler]] observed similar craters and said they were likely caused by lightning strikes.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Ernest Butler 'That Wiltshire Crater', ''New Scientist'' issue 352, 15 August 1963 Letters to the editor&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, in [[Tully, Queensland]], Australia, and in Canada, there were many reports of UFO sightings and circular formations in swamp reeds and sugar cane fields.&lt;ref name=skepticssa/&gt; For example, on 8 August 1967, three circles were found in a field in [[Duhamel, Alberta]], Canada; [[Department of National Defence (Canada)|Department of National Defence]] investigators concluded that it was artificial but couldn't say who made them or how.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/ufo/002029-1200-e.html |title= Canada's Unidentified Flying Objects: The Search for the Unknown: Duhamel, Alberta: August 1967 |date= 14 December 2007 |origyear= 2005}} At Library and Archives Canada. ([http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/ovni/002029-1200.01-f.html Original] in French).&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous case is the 1966 Tully "saucer nest", when a farmer said he witnessed a saucer-shaped craft rise 30 or {{convert|40|ft|m}} from a swamp and then fly away. On investigating he found a nearly circular area 32 feet long by 25 feet wide where the grass was flattened in clockwise curves to water level within the circle, and the reeds had been uprooted from the mud.&lt;ref name=skepticssa&gt;{{cite web |author= Laurie Eddie |date= 4 November 2004 |url= http://www.skepticssa.org.au/html/cropcircles.html |title= The Skeptics SA Guide to: Crop circles |work= Skepticssa.org.au. |publisher= Skeptics SA |accessdate= 2012-01-01 |ref= {{harvid|Eddie|2004}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; The local police officer, the [[Royal Australian Air Force]], and the [[University of Queensland]] concluded that it was most probably caused by natural causes, like a down draught, a [[willy-willy]] (dust devil), or a [[waterspout]]. In 1973, G.J. Odgers, Director of Public Relations, Department of Defence (Air Office), wrote to a journalist that the "saucer" was probably debris lifted by the causing willy-willy. Hoaxers Bower and Chorley said they were inspired by this case to start making the modern crop circles that appear today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= The flattened crops society |work= [[The Scotsman]] |date= September 7, 2002 | author= Jim Gilchrist |url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-12991491.html }} (registration required)&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1960s, there had been a surge of UFOlogists in [[Wiltshire]], and there were rumours of "saucer nests" appearing in the area, but they were never photographed.&lt;ref name="smithsonian"/&gt; There are other pre-1970s reports of circular formations, especially in Australia and Canada, but they were always simple circles, which could have been caused by whirlwinds.&lt;ref name=skepticssa/&gt; In ''[[Fortean Times]]'' David Wood reported that in 1940 he had already made crop circles near [[Gloucestershire]] using ropes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eddie|2004}} citing: {{cite journal |author= D. Wood |year= 2000 |title= Pioneer pranksters? |journal= [[Fortean Times]] |volume= 131 |issue= 52}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' recorded the earliest usage of the term "crop circles" in a 1988 issue of ''[[Journal of Meteorology]]'', referring to a BBC film.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', "Crop: Draft additions 1997", in '' Jrnl. Meteorol''. 13 290.&lt;/ref&gt; The coining of the term "crop circle" is attributed to [[Colin Andrews]] in the late 1970s or early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Brian Regal |title= Pseudoscience: A Critical Encyclopedia |publisher= Greenwood Press |year= 2009 |isbn= 9780313355073 |page= [https://books.google.com/books?ei=2aNnUpPmK-LT0QWBxIGIDw&amp;id=14AbAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22crop+circles%22++colin+andrews+coined&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=coined 47]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/5452330/Crop-circle-picture-gallery-shows-more-complex-forms.html |title= Crop circle picture gallery shows more complex forms |newspaper= The Telegraph |date= 5 June 2009 |accessdate= 23 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of reports of crop circles have appeared in and spread since the late 1970s&lt;ref name=dutch&gt;{{cite book |title= Reframing Dutch Culture: Between Otherness and Authenticity |series= Progress in European Ethnology |author1= Peter Jan Margry |author2= Herman Roodenburg |edition= illustrated |publisher= [[Ashgate Publishing]] |year= 2007 |pages= 150–51 |isbn= 9780754647058 |ref= {{harvid|Margry &amp; Roodenburg|2007}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; as many circles began appearing throughout the English countryside. This phenomenon became widely known in the late 1980s, after the media started to report crop circles in [[Hampshire]] and Wiltshire. After Bower's and Chorley's 1991 statement that they were responsible for many of them, circles started appearing all over the world.&lt;ref name="Taylor2011" /&gt; To date, approximately 10,000 crop circles have been reported internationally, from locations such as the former Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, Japan, the U.S., and Canada. Sceptics note a correlation between crop circles, recent media coverage, and the absence of fencing and/or anti-trespassing legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Disease brings poor crop of circles | newspaper = BBC News | date = 2001-08-17 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1496296.stm | accessdate = 2007-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although farmers expressed concern at the damage caused to their crops, local response to the appearance of crop circles was often enthusiastic, with locals taking advantage of the increase of tourism and visits from scientists, crop circle researchers, and individuals seeking spiritual experiences.&lt;ref name=NGEO&gt;{{cite news |author= Hillary Mayell |url= http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/08/0801_020801_cropcircles.html |title= Crop circles: Artwork or alien signs |page= [http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/08/0801_020801_cropcircles_2.html 2] |magazine= National Geographic |date= 2 August 2002 |accessdate= 28 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The market for crop-circle interest consequently generated bus or helicopter tours of circle sites, walking tours, T-shirts, and book sales.

=== 21st century ===
Since the start of the 21st century, crop formations have increased in size and complexity, with some featuring as many as 2,000 different shapes&lt;ref name="Taylor2011" /&gt; and some incorporating complex mathematical and scientific characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Benjamin Radford |url= http://www.livescience.com/6546-beautiful-math-equation-crop-circle.html |title= 'Beautiful Math Equation' Found in Crop Circle |work= [[LiveScience]] |date= 8 June 2010 |accessdate= 2012-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Marc West |date= 2008-06-30 |url= http://plus.maths.org/content/pi-appears-crop-circle |title= Pi appears in crop circle |work= plus.maths.org. |accessdate= 2012-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/crop-circle-season-arrives-with-a-mathematical-message-1982647.html |title= Crop circle season arrives with a mathematical message |department= This Britain |newspaper= The Independent |date= 2010-05-26 |accessdate= 2012-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The researcher Jeremy Northcote found that crop circles in the UK in 2002 were not spread randomly across the landscape. They tended to appear near roads, areas of medium-to-dense population, and cultural heritage monuments such as [[Stonehenge]] or [[Avebury]]. He found that they always appeared in areas that were easy to access. This suggests strongly that these crop circles were more likely to be caused by intentional human action than by paranormal activity. Another strong indication of that theory was that inhabitants of the zone with the most circles had a historical tendency for making large-scale formations, including stone circles such as Stonehenge, burial mounds such as [[Silbury Hill]], long barrows such as [[West Kennet Long Barrow]], and [[:Category:White horses in England|white horses in chalk hills]].&lt;ref name="northcote"/&gt;

== Bower and Chorley ==
In 1991, self-professed [[practical joke|pranksters]] Doug Bower and Dave Chorley made headlines claiming it was they who started the phenomenon in 1978 with the use of simple tools consisting of a plank of wood, rope, and a baseball cap fitted with a loop of wire to help them walk in a straight line.&lt;ref name="today91"&gt;{{cite news |author= Graham Brough |year= 1991 |title= Men who conned the world |newspaper= Today (defunct) |location= UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; To prove their case they made a circle in front of journalists; a "cereologist" (advocate of paranormal explanations of crop circles), Pat Delgado, examined the circle and declared it authentic before it was revealed that it was a hoax.&lt;ref name="nyt1991"&gt;{{cite news |title= 2 'Jovial Con Men' Demystify Those Crop Circles in Britain |newspaper= New York Times |author= William E.

According to Professor Richard Taylor, "the pictographs they created inspired a second wave of crop artists. Far from fizzling out, crop circles have evolved into an international phenomenon, with hundreds of sophisticated pictographs now appearing annually around the globe."&lt;ref name="Taylor2011"/&gt;

''Smithsonian'' magazine wrote:

:Since Bower and Chorley’s circles appeared, the geometric designs have escalated in scale and complexity, as each year teams of anonymous circle-makers lay honey traps for New Age tourists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/crop-circles-the-art-of-the-hoax-2524283/ |title=Crop Circles: The Art of the Hoax |newspaper=Smithsonian |first1=Rob |last1=Irving |first2=Peter |last2=Brookesmith |date=15 December 2009 |accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sthlm gtb top.jpg|thumb|A crop circle with the logo of [[Swedish Railways]].]]

Since the early 1990s, the UK arts collective ''Circlemakers,'' founded by artists [[Rod Dickinson]] and [[John Lundberg]] (and subsequently including artists Wil Russell and Rob Irving), have been creating crop circles in the UK and around the world as part of their art practice and for commercial clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Henry Hemming |year= 2009 |title= In Search of the English Eccentric |publisher= John Murray |isbn= 0719522129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the night of 11–12 July 1992, a crop-circle making competition with a prize of [[Pound sterling|£]]3,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Crop Circles|author=Andrea Pelleschi|publisher=Essential Library/ABDO|year=2012|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; (funded in part by the [[Arthur Koestler]] Foundation) was held in [[Berkshire]].

The prize money came from ''PM'', a German magazine. Sheldrake wrote that "The experiment was conclusive. Humans could indeed make all the features of state-of-the-art crop formations at that time. Eleven of the twelve teams made more or less impressive formations that followed the set design."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Rupert Sheldrake |title= The Crop Circle Making Competition |url= http://www.sheldrake.org/Articles&amp;Papers/articles/pdf/Cropcircles_Michellany.pdf |publisher= Rupert Sheldrake |accessdate= 10 August 2012 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121207041147/http://www.sheldrake.org/Articles%26Papers/articles/pdf/Cropcircles_Michellany.pdf |archivedate= 7 December 2012 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, [[Discovery Channel]] commissioned five aeronautics and astronautics graduate students from [[MIT]] to create crop circles of their own, aiming to duplicate some of the features claimed to distinguish "real" crop circles from the known fakes such as those created by Bower and Chorley.

== Legal implications ==
In 1992, Hungarian youths Gábor Takács and Róbert Dallos, both then 17, were the first people to face legal action after creating a crop circle. Takács and Dallos, of the St. Stephen Agricultural Technicum, a high school in Hungary specializing in [[agriculture]], created a {{convert|36|m|adj=on}} diameter crop circle in a wheat field near [[Székesfehérvár]], {{convert|43|mi|km|0}} southwest of [[Budapest]], on June 8, 1992. On September 3, the pair appeared on Hungarian TV and exposed the circle as a hoax, showing photos of the field before and after the circle was made. As a result, Aranykalász Co., the owners of the land, sued the teens for 630,000&amp;nbsp;[[Hungarian forint|Ft]] (~$3,000 USD) in [[damages]]. The presiding judge ruled that the students were only responsible for the damage caused in the circle itself, amounting to about 6,000&amp;nbsp;Ft (~$30 USD), and that 99% of the damage to the crops was caused by the thousands of visitors who flocked to Székesfehérvár following the media's promotion of the circle. The fine was eventually paid by the TV show, as were the students' legal fees.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

== Creation ==
[[File:Swiss crop circle detail.jpg|thumb|Detail of a crop circle in a field in Switzerland]]
The scientific consensus on crop circles is that they are constructed by human beings as hoaxes, [[advertising]], or [[Crop art#Crop circles|art]].&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; The most widely known method for a person or group to construct a crop formation is to tie one end of a rope to an anchor point and the other end to a board which is used to crush the plants. Sceptics of the paranormal point out that all characteristics of crop circles are fully compatible with their being made by hoaxers.&lt;ref name="csicop"/&gt;

Bower and Chorley confessed in 1991 to making the first crop circles in southern England.&lt;ref name="Taylor2011"/&gt; When some people refused to believe them, they deliberately added straight lines and squares to show that they could not have natural causes. In a copycat effect, increasingly complex circles started appearing in many countries around the world, including fractal figures. Physicists have suggested that the most complex formations might be made with the help of GPS and lasers. In 2009, a circle formation was made over the course of three consecutive nights and was apparently left unfinished, with some half-made circles.&lt;ref name="Taylor2011"/&gt;

The main criticism of alleged non-human creation of crop circles is that while evidence of these origins, besides eyewitness testimonies, is essentially absent, some are definitely known to be the work of human pranksters, and others can be adequately explained as such. There have been cases in which researchers declared crop circles to be "the real thing", only to be confronted with the people who created the circle and documented the fraud,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Joe Nickell |authorlink= Joe Nickell |title= Crop-circle mania: An investigative update |journal= Skeptical Inquirer}} Cited as reference 6 in {{harvnb|Nickell|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; like Bower and Chorley and tabloid ''Today'' hoaxing Pat Delgado,&lt;ref name="today91"/&gt;&lt;ref name="economist91"/&gt; the Wessex Sceptics and [[Channel 4]]'s ''Equinox'' hoaxing Terence Meaden,&lt;ref name="Ridley"/&gt;&lt;ref name="economist91"&gt;{{cite news |title= Flattened.

Methods of creating a crop circle are now well documented on the [[Internet]].{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Some crop formations are paid for by companies who use them as advertising.&lt;ref name="vidal guardian"/&gt;{{refn|group=n|name= "Cohen2008"}} Many crop circles show human symbols, like the heart and arrow symbol of love, stereotyped alien faces,{{refn|group=n|The website Crop Circle Research.com described one formation stating, "It looks reminiscent of a fake dummy constructed by 'Balok' in a Star Trek episode called '[[The Corbomite Maneuver|Corbomite Manourvre]]'{{sic}} (series 1)' or the logo of local soccer club [[Feyenoord]]".{{sfn|Margry &amp; Roodenburg|2007|pages= 143–45}}}}

== Alternative explanations ==
=== Weather ===
It has been suggested that crop circles may be the result of extraordinary meteorological phenomena ranging from freak [[tornado]]es to [[ball lightning]], but there is no evidence of any crop circle being created by any of these causes.&lt;ref name="Taylor2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="csicop"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Joe Nickell |url= http://www.csicop.org/si/show/circular_reasoning_the_mystery_of_crop_circles_and_their_orbs_of_light/ |title= Circular Reasoning: The 'Mystery' of Crop Circles and Their 'Orbs' of Light |journal= Skeptical Inquirer |volume= 26.5 |date=September–October 2002 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061206012813/http://www.csicop.org/si/2002-09/crop-circles.html |archivedate= 2006-12-06 |deadurl= no |ref= {{harvid|Nickell|2002}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1880, an amateur scientist, John Rand Capron, wrote a letter to the editor of journal ''Nature'' about some circles in crops and blamed them on a recent storm, saying their shape was "suggestive of some cyclonic wind action".{{refn|group=n|name= "Capron1880"}}

In 1980, Terence Meaden, a meteorologist and physicist, proposed that the circles were caused by whirlwinds whose course was affected by southern England hills.&lt;ref name="Taylor2011"/&gt; As circles became more complex, Terence had to create increasingly complex theories, blaming an electromagneto-hydrodynamic "plasma vortex".&lt;ref name="Taylor2011"/&gt; The meteorological theory became popular, and it was even referenced in 1991 by physicist [[Stephen Hawking]] who said that, "Corn circles are either hoaxes or formed by vortex movement of air".&lt;ref name="Taylor2011"&gt;{{cite journal|date=August 2011|title=Coming soon to a field near you|url=https://blogs.uoregon.edu/richardtaylor/files/2015/12/CropCirclesphysicsworld-1o814jx.pdf|department=Feature: Crop circles|journal=Physics World|ref={{harvid|Taylor|2011}}|author=Richard Taylor}}&lt;/ref&gt; The weather theory suffered a serious blow in 1991, but Hawking's point about hoaxes was supported when Bower and Chorley stated that they had been responsible for making all those circles.{{refn|group=n|name="Taylor2011_note"|In a ''Physics World'' article Richard Taylor wrote, "Today, with the benefit of hindsight, such explanations sound rather contrived. At the height of the debate, though, no less a physicist than Stephen Hawking was prepared to accept some version of Meaden's theory.

Since becoming the focus of widespread media attention in the 1980s, crop circles have become the subject of speculation by various [[paranormal]], [[ufology|ufological]], and [[forteana|anomalistic]] investigators ranging from proposals that they were created by bizarre meteorological phenomena to messages from [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial beings]].&lt;ref name="csicop"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/5777580/Mayan-apocalypse-crop-circle-appears-at-Silbury-Hill.html |title= Mayan 'apocalypse' crop circle appears at Silbury Hill |newspaper= The Telegraph |date= 8 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Haselhoff1&gt;{{cite book |author= Eltjo Haselhoff |year= 2001 |title= The Deepening Complexity of Crop Circles: Scientific Research &amp; Urban Legends |publisher= Frog Ltd |isbn= 1583940464}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=clark1&gt;{{cite book |author1= Jerome Clark |author2= Nancy Pear |year= 1995 |title= Strange and Unexplained Happenings: When Nature Breaks the Rules of Science |publisher= [[Gale (publisher)|Gale]] |volume= 3 |isbn= 0810397803}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has also been speculation that crop circles have a relation to [[ley line]]s.&lt;ref name=Haselhoff1/&gt;{{sfn|Margry &amp; Roodenburg|2007|pages= 138–39}}&lt;ref name=faussett1&gt;{{cite book |author= Charles Godfrey-Faussett |year= 2004 |title= England |series= Footprint Travel Guides |isbn= 1903471915}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many  [[New Age]] groups incorporate crop circles into their belief systems.

Some paranormal advocates think that crop circles are caused by ball lighting and that the patterns are so complex that they have to be controlled by some entity.{{sfn|Margry &amp; Roodenburg|2007|page= 138}} Some proposed entities are: [[Gaia hypothesis|Gaia]] asking to stop [[global warming]] and human [[pollution]], God, supernatural beings (for example Indian [[Deva (Hinduism)|devas]]), the collective minds of humanity through a proposed "quantum field", or extraterrestrial beings.{{sfn|Margry &amp; Roodenburg|2007|page= 138}}

Responding to local beliefs that "extraterrestrial beings" in UFOs were responsible for crop circles appearing, the Indonesian [[National Institute of Aeronautics and Space]] (LAPAN) described crop circles as "man-made". Thomas Djamaluddin, research professor of astronomy and astrophysics at LAPAN stated, "We have come to agree that this 'thing' cannot be scientifically proven." Among others, paranormal enthusiasts, ufologists, and [[anomalistics|anomalistic]] investigators have offered hypothetical explanations that have been criticized as [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] by [[scientific skepticism|sceptical]] groups and scientists, including the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]].&lt;ref name="vidal guardian"&gt;{{cite news |author= John Vidal |url= https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/jun/05/ruralaffairs |title= The bizarre revival of crop circles – and advice on how to make your own |newspaper= The Guardian |date= 5 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nickell1996&gt;{{cite journal |author= Joe Nickell |authorlink= Joe Nickell |journal= [[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=June 1996 |volume= 6.2 |url=http://www.csicop.org/sb/show/levengoods_crop-circle_plant_research |title=Levengood’s crop-circle plant research |ref= {{harvid|Nickell|1996}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=levengood1994&gt;{{cite journal|author=W.C.

=== Animal activity ===
In 2009, the attorney general for the island state of [[Tasmania]] stated that Australian [[Wallaby|wallabies]] had been found creating crop circles in fields of [[opium poppy|opium poppies]], which are grown legally for medicinal use, after consuming some of the opiate-laden poppies and running in circles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | newspaper= BBC News | date= 25 June 2009|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8118257.stm|title=Stoned wallabies make crop circles|accessdate=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Changes to crops ===
A small number of scientists (physicist Eltjo Haselhoff, the late&lt;!--described as semi-retired by csicop source--&gt; biophysicist William Levengood) have found differences between the crops inside the circles and outside them, citing this as evidence they were not man-made.&lt;ref name="Taylor2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name=csicop/&gt;

Levengood published papers in journal ''[[Physiologia Plantarum]]'' in 1994&lt;ref name=levengood1994 /&gt; and 1999.&lt;ref name=levengood1999&gt;{{cite journal |author1= W.C. Levengood |author2= Nancy P. Talbott |year= 1999 |title= Dispersion of energies in worldwide crop formations |journal= Physiologia Plantarum |volume= 105 |pages= 615–24 |doi=10.1034/j.1399-3054.1999.105404.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1994 paper he found that certain deformities in the grain inside the circles were correlated to the position of the grain inside the circle.&lt;ref name=csicop/&gt; In 1996 sceptic [[Joe Nickell]] objected that [[correlation is not causation]],&lt;ref name=csicop/&gt; raised several objections to the Levengood's methods and assumptions,&lt;ref name=nickell1996/&gt; and said "Until his work is independently replicated by qualified scientists doing 'double-blind' studies and otherwise following stringent scientific protocols, there seems no need to take seriously the many dubious claims that Levengood makes, including his similar ones involving plants at alleged 'cattle mutilation' sites." (in reference to [[cattle mutilation]]).&lt;ref name=nickell1996/&gt;

A study by Eltjo Haselhoff reported that the [[pulvini]] of wheat in 95% of the crop circles investigated were elongated in a pattern falling off with distance from the centre and that seeds from the bent-over plants grew much more slowly under controlled conditions. Furthermore, traces of crop circle patterns are sometimes found in the crop the following year, "suggesting long-term damage to the crop field consistent with Levengood's observations of stunted seed growth."

=== Magnetism ===
In 2000, Colin Andrews, who had researched crop circles for 17 years, stated that while he believed 80% were man-made, he thought the remaining circles, with less elaborate designs, could be explained by a three-degree shift in the [[Earth's magnetic field]], that creates a current that "electrocutes" the crops, causing them to flatten and form the circle.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/872142.stm | title=Magnetic 'solution' to crop circle puzzle | work=BBC News | date=9 August 2000 | accessdate=30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Folklore ==
Researchers of crop circles have linked modern crop circles to old [[Folklore|folkloric]] tales to support the claim that they are not artificially produced.&lt;ref name=dutch /&gt; Circle crops are culture-dependent: they appear mostly in developed and secularized Western countries where people are receptive to New Age beliefs, including Japan, but they don't appear at all in other zones, such as Muslim countries.{{sfn|Margry &amp; Roodenburg|2007|page= 152}}

Fungi can cause circular areas of crop to die, probably the origin of tales of "[[Fairy ring|fairie rings]]".&lt;ref name=dutch /&gt; Tales also mention [[Will-o'-the-wisp|balls of light]] many times but never in relation to crop circles.&lt;ref name=dutch /&gt;

[[File:Diablefaucheur.jpg|thumb|upright|1678 pamphlet on the "[[Mowing-Devil]]".]]

A 17th-century English [[woodcut]] called the ''[[Mowing-Devil]]'' depicts the [[devil]] with a [[scythe]] mowing (cutting) a circular design in a field of oats. The [[pamphlet]] containing the image states that the farmer, disgusted at the wage his mower was demanding for his work, insisted that he would rather have "the devil himself" perform the task.  Crop circle researcher Jim Schnabel does not consider this to be a historical precedent for crop circles because the stalks were cut down, not bent.&lt;ref name=dutch /&gt; The circular form indicated to the farmer that it had been caused by the devil.&lt;ref name=dutch /&gt;

In the 1948 German story ''Die zwölf Schwäne'' (''The Twelve Swans''), a farmer every morning found a circular ring of flattened grain on his field. After several attempts, his son saw twelve [[swan maiden|princesses disguised as swans]], who took off their disguises and danced in the field. Crop rings produced by fungi may have inspired such tales since folklore holds these rings are created by dancing wolves or fairies.&lt;ref name=dutch /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2280">A '''data janitor''' is a person who works to take [[big data]] and condense it into useful amounts of information. Also known as a "data wrangler," a data janitor sifts through data for companies in the [[information technology]] industry. A multitude of [[startup company|start-ups]] rely on large amounts of data, so a data janitor works to help these businesses with this basic, but difficult process of interpreting data.

While it is a commonly held belief that data janitor work is fully automated, many data scientists are employed primarily as data janitors. The Information technology industry has been increasingly turning towards new sources of data gathered on [[consumers]], so data janitors have become more commonplace in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lohr|first1=Steve|title=For Big-Data Scientists, ‘Janitor Work’ Is Key Hurdle to Insights|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/18/technology/for-big-data-scientists-hurdle-to-insights-is-janitor-work.html|website=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Data janitors work in a process that largely consists of four steps: selection and defining relationships, extraction and organization, loading, and interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In Big Data, Preparing Data is Most of the Work|url=http://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/in-big-data-preparing-the-data-is-most-of-the-work|website=Data Science Central|publisher=Sullexis LLC|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data janitors identify sources of data before selecting which data is relevant and find the relationships between the data that will be useful to the company's projects. Next, they structure the data in an effort to extract the information and put it into a format that can be stored in a secure place for the business. Last, the data janitors work with other employees to create [[Presentation program|visual aids]] to present to managers and executives who will eventually benefit from the conclusions that can be made from them. In this way, the work of data janitors is integral to the functioning of businesses that rely on large amounts data to function.

{{paranormal}}
Within [[ghost hunting]] and [[parapsychology]], '''electronic voice phenomena''' ('''EVP''') are sounds found on electronic recordings that are interpreted as [[spirit]] voices that have been either unintentionally recorded or intentionally requested and recorded. Parapsychologist [[Konstantīns Raudive]], who popularized the idea in the 1970s, described EVP as typically brief, usually the length of a word or short phrase.&lt;ref name="bretf"/&gt;

Enthusiasts consider EVP to be a form of [[paranormal]] phenomenon often found in recordings with [[white noise|static]] or other [[background noise]]. However, scientists regard EVP as a form of auditory [[pareidolia]] (interpreting random sounds as voices in one's own language) and a [[pseudoscience]] promulgated by popular culture.&lt;ref name="Williams2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=William F.

==History==
As the [[spiritualism|Spiritualist]] [[religious movement]] became prominent in the 1840s–1920s with a distinguishing belief that the [[spirit]]s of the dead can be contacted by [[medium (spirituality)|mediums]], new technologies of the era including [[spirit photography|photography]] were employed by spiritualists in an effort to demonstrate contact with a [[Spirit world (spiritualism)|spirit world]]. So popular were such ideas that [[Thomas Edison]] was asked in an interview with ''[[Scientific American]]'' to comment on the possibility of using his inventions to communicate with spirits. He replied that if the spirits were only capable of subtle influences, a sensitive recording device would provide a better chance of spirit communication than the table tipping and [[ouija boards]] mediums employed at the time. However, there is no indication that Edison ever designed or constructed a device for such a purpose.&lt;ref name="SkepDic"&gt;Carroll, Robert Todd, ''[[The Skeptic's Dictionary]]'' 2003, Wiley Publishing Company, {{ISBN|0-471-27242-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[sound recording]] became widespread, mediums explored using this technology to demonstrate communication with the dead as well. Spiritualism  declined in the latter part of the 20th century, but attempts to use portable recording devices and modern digital technologies to communicate with spirits continued.&lt;ref name="fontana1"&gt;{{cite book | last = Fontana | first = David | authorlink = | title = Is There an Afterlife: A Comprehensive Review of the Evidence | publisher = O Books | year=  2005 | location = Hants, UK |url = | doi = | isbn = 1-903816-90-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|352–381}}

===Early interest===
American photographer Attila von Szalay was among the first to try recording what he believed to be voices of the dead as a way to augment his investigations in photographing ghosts. He began his attempts in 1941 using a 78 rpm record, but it wasn't until 1956 — after switching to a reel-to-reel tape recorder — that he believed he was successful.&lt;ref name=senkowski&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worlditc.org/f_07_senkowski_analysis.htm |title=Analysis of Anomalous Audio and Video Recordings, presented before the "Society For Scientific Exploration" USA – June 1995 |accessdate=2007-09-18 |last=Senkowski |first=Ernst |year=1995 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013092253/http://worlditc.org/f_07_senkowski_analysis.htm |archivedate=2007-10-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Working with Raymond Bayless, von Szalay conducted a number of recording sessions with a custom-made apparatus, consisting of a microphone in an insulated cabinet connected to an external recording device and speaker. Szalay reported finding many sounds on the tape that could not be heard on the speaker at the time of recording, some of which were recorded when there was no one in the cabinet. He believed these sounds to be the voices of discarnate spirits. Among the first recordings believed to be spirit voices were such messages as "This is G!", "Hot dog, Art!", and "Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to you all".&lt;ref name="senkowski"/&gt;  Von Szalay and Raymond Bayless' work was published by the Journal of the [[American Society for Psychical Research]] in 1959.&lt;ref name=brune1&gt;{{cite book | last = Brune | first = Francois | authorlink = | title = The Dead Speak To Us | publisher = Philippe Lebaud | year=  1988 | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 2-253-05123-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bayless later went on to co-author the 1979 book, ''Phone Calls From the Dead''.

In 1959, Swedish painter and film producer Friedrich Jürgenson was recording bird songs. Upon playing the tape later, he heard what he interpreted to be his dead father's voice and then the spirit of his deceased wife calling his name.&lt;ref name="senkowski"/&gt; He went on to make several more recordings, including one that he said contained a message from his late mother.&lt;ref name="Cardoso 2003"&gt;{{cite book | last = Cardoso | first = Anabela | authorlink = | title = ITC Voices: Contact with Another Reality? | publisher = ParaDocs | year=  2003 | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Raudive voices===
[[Konstantin Raudive]], a Latvian psychologist who had taught at the [[Uppsala University]], Sweden and who had worked in conjunction with Jürgenson, made over 100,000 recordings which he described as being communications with [[Wiktionary:discarnate|discarnate]] people. Some of these recordings were conducted in an RF-screened laboratory and contained words Raudive said were identifiable.&lt;ref name=bretf&gt;{{cite book | last = Raudive | first = Konstantin | authorlink = Konstantin Raudive | title = Breakthrough: An Amazing Experiment in Electronic Communication With the Dead (Original title: The Inaudible Becomes Audible) | publisher = Taplinger Publishing Co. |year= 1971 | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | isbn = 0-8008-0965-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fontana1" /&gt;{{rp|352–381}} In an attempt to confirm the content of his collection of recordings, Raudive invited listeners to hear and interpret them.&lt;ref name=fontana1/&gt;{{rp|353, 496}}&lt;ref name="senkowski"/&gt;&lt;ref name="brune1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cardoso 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name=bander&gt;{{cite book | last = Bander | first = Peter | authorlink = | title = Voices from the tapes: Recordings from the other world | publisher = Drake Publishers | year=  1973 | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | asin = B0006CCBAE }}&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that the clarity of the voices heard in his recordings implied that they could not be readily explained by normal means.&lt;ref name="fontana1"/&gt;{{rp|352–381}} Raudive published his first book, ''Breakthrough: An Amazing Experiment in Electronic Communication with the Dead'' in 1968 and it was translated into English in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://worlditc.org/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-09-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070912093308/http://worlditc.org/ |archivedate=2007-09-12 |df= }} Under researchers results - Konstantin Raudive.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spiricom and Frank's Box===
In 1980, William O'Neil constructed an electronic audio device called "The Spiricom". O'Neil claimed the device was built to specifications which he received [[psychic]]ally from George Mueller, a scientist who had died six years previously.&lt;ref name=fontana1/&gt;{{rp|352–381}}&lt;ref name=Baruss/&gt; At a [[Washington, DC]] press conference on April 6, 1982, O'Neil stated that he was able to hold two-way conversations with spirits through the Spiricom device, and provided the design specifications to researchers for free. However, nobody is known to have replicated the results O'Neil claimed using his own Spiricom devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wintersteel.com/EVP.html |title=Electronic Voice Phenomena |accessdate=2007-09-20 |publisher=Winter Steel |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070919105304/http://www.wintersteel.com/EVP.html |archivedate=2007-09-19 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worlditc.org/h_07_meek_spiri_000_007.htm |title=An electromagnetic-etheric systems approach to communications with other levels of human consciousness |accessdate=2007-09-20 |last=Meek |first=George W |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629013254/http://worlditc.org/h_07_meek_spiri_000_007.htm |archivedate = 2011-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Neil's partner, retired industrialist George Meek, attributed O'Neil's success, and the inability of others to replicate it, to O'Neil's [[Mediumship|mediumistic]] abilities forming part of the loop that made the system work.&lt;ref name="Baruss"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Meek1"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Report from Europe: Earthside instrumental communications with higher planes of existence via telephone and computer are now a reality|journal=Unlimited Horizons, Metascience Foundation Inc|year=1988|first=George W|last=Meek|volume=6|issue=1|pages=1–11|id= |url=|format=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another electronic device specifically constructed in an attempt to capture EVP is "Frank's Box" or the "Ghost Box", created in 2002 by EVP enthusiast Frank Sumption for supposed real-time communication with the dead. Sumption claims he received his design instructions from the spirit world. The device is described as a combination [[white noise]] generator and [[AM broadcasting|AM radio]] [[Receiver (radio)|receiver]] modified to sweep back and forth through the [[Amplitude modulation|AM]] band selecting split-second snippets of sound. Critics of the device say its effect is subjective and incapable of being replicated, and since it relies on radio noise, any meaningful response a user gets is purely coincidental, or simply the result of [[pareidolia]].&lt;ref name="CSI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/franks_box_the_broken_radio/|title=Frank’s Box: The Broken Radio|last=Stollznow|first=Karen|authorlink=Karen Stollznow|date=January 28, 2010|publisher=The Committee For Skeptical Inquiry|accessdate=13 September 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100726072215/http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/franks_box_the_broken_radio|archivedate=26 July 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paranormal researcher [[Ben Radford]] writes that Frank's Box is a "modern version of the [[Ouija board]]... also known as the 'broken radio'".&lt;ref name="Radford 2017"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Radford |first1=Ben|authorlink=Ben Radford|title=Investigating Ghosts: The Scientific Search for Spirits |date=2017 |publisher=Rhombus Publishing Company |location=Corrales, New Mexico |isbn=978-0-936455-16-7 |page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern interest===
In 1982, Sarah Estep founded the American Association of Electronic Voice Phenomena (AA-EVP) in [[Severna Park, Maryland]], a nonprofit organization with the purpose of increasing awareness of EVP, and of teaching standardized methods for capturing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Association TransCommunication  (Previously known as the AA-EVP)|url=http://atransc.org|publisher=atransc.org|accessdate=23 April 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20130424030901/http://atransc.org/|archivedate=24 April 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estep began her exploration of EVP in 1976, and says she has made hundreds of recordings of messages from deceased friends, relatives, and [[extraterrestrials]] whom she speculated originated from other planets or dimensions.&lt;ref name="Carroll2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Carroll|title=The Skeptic's Dictionary: A Collection of Strange Beliefs, Amusing Deceptions, and Dangerous Delusions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6FPqDFx40vYC|accessdate=22 April 2013|date=11 January 2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-118-04563-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term Instrumental Trans-Communication (ITC) was coined by Ernst Senkowski in the 1970s to refer more generally to communication through any sort of electronic device such as tape recorders, fax machines, television sets or computers between [[Soul|spirits]] or other discarnate entities and the living.&lt;ref name=Baruss&gt;Baruss, Imants (2001), [http://www.scientificexploration.org/journal/jse_15_3_baruss.pdf ''Failure to Replicate Electronic Voice Phenomenon''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130228125352/http://www.scientificexploration.org/journal/jse_15_3_baruss.pdf |date=2013-02-28 }}, Journal of Scientific Exploration, V15#3, 0892-3310/01&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=itcvoic1&gt;Cardoso, Anabela (2003) "ITC Voices: Contact with Another Reality?"&lt;/ref&gt; One particularly famous claimed incidence of ITC occurred when the image of EVP enthusiast Friedrich Jürgenson (whose funeral was held that day) was said to have appeared on a television in the home of a colleague, which had been purposefully tuned to a vacant channel.&lt;ref name=Baruss/&gt; ITC enthusiasts also look at the TV and video camera feedback loop of the [[Droste effect]].&lt;ref name="CLAUS"&gt;" {{cite web|url=http://www.worlditc.org/h_08_schreiber_0.htm |title=Claus Schreiber, Germany |accessdate=2007-09-21 |publisher=World ITC }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skepdic.com/itc.html |title=Skeptic's Dictionary on instrumental transcommunication (ITC) |accessdate=2007-09-22 |last=Carroll |first=Robert Todd |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030202147/http://skepdic.com/itc.html |archivedate=2007-10-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, parapsychologist [[D. Scott Rogo]] described an alleged [[paranormal]] phenomenon in which people report that they receive simple, brief, and usually single-occurrence [[telephone]] calls from [[ghost|spirits]] of deceased relatives, friends, or strangers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rogo|first=D. Scott|authorlink=D. Scott Rogo|last2=Bayless|first2=Raymond|title=Phone Calls from the Dead|year=1979|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=New York|isbn=0-13-664334-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rosemary Ellen Guiley|Rosemary Guiley]] has written "within the parapsychology establishment, Rogo was often faulted for poor scholarship, which, critics said, led to erroneous conclusions."&lt;ref&gt;[[Rosemary Ellen Guiley|Guiley, Rosemary]]. (1992). ''The Guinness Encyclopedia of Ghosts and Spirits''. pp. 284-285&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, the parapsychologist [[David Fontana]] proposed in an article that poltergeists could haunt tape recorders. He speculated that this may have happened to the parapsychologist [[Maurice Grosse]] who investigated the [[Enfield Poltergeist]] case. However, Tom Flynn a media expert for the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] examined Fontana's article and suggested an entirely naturalistic explanation for the phenomena. According to the skeptical investigator [[Joe Nickell]] "Occasionally, especially with older tape and under humid conditions, as the tape travels it can adhere to one of the guide posts. When this happens on a deck where both supply and take-up spindles are powered, the tape continues to feed, creating a fold. It was such a loop of tape, Flynn theorizes, that threaded its way amid the works of Grosse’s recorder."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csicop.org/sb/show/haunted_tape_recorder/|title=The Haunted Tape Recorder - CSI|website=www.csicop.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109011116/http://www.csicop.org/sb/show/haunted_tape_recorder/|archivedate=2015-01-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, [[Imants Barušs]], of the Department of Psychology at the University of Western Ontario, conducted a series of experiments using the methods of EVP investigator [[Konstantin Raudive]], and the work of "instrumental transcommunication researcher" Mark Macy, as a guide. A radio was tuned to an empty frequency, and over 81 sessions a total of 60 hours and 11 minutes of recordings were collected. During recordings, a person either sat in silence or attempted to make verbal contact with potential sources of EVP.&lt;ref name="Baruss"/&gt; Barušs stated that he did record several events that sounded like voices, but they were too few and too random to represent viable data and too open to interpretation to be described definitively as EVP. He concluded: "While we did replicate EVP in the weak sense of finding voices on audio tapes, none of the phenomena found in our study was clearly anomalous, let alone attributable to discarnate beings. Hence we have failed to replicate EVP in the strong sense." The findings were published in the ''[[Journal of Scientific Exploration]]'' in 2001, and include a literature review.&lt;ref name="Baruss"/&gt;

In 2005, the ''Journal of the [[Society for Psychical Research]]'' published a report by paranormal investigator Alexander MacRae.  MacRae conducted recording sessions using a device of his own design that generated EVP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In an attempt to demonstrate that different individuals would interpret EVP in the recordings the same way, MacRae asked seven people to compare some selections to a list of five phrases he provided, and to choose the best match. MacRae said the results of the listening panels indicated that the selections were of paranormal origin.&lt;ref name=senkowski /&gt;&lt;ref name="macRae1"&gt;{{cite journal | last = MacRae | first = Alexander | authorlink = | title = Report of an Electronic Voice Phenomenon Experiment inside a Double-Screened Room | journal = Journal of the Society for Psychical Research | volume = | issue = | pages = | publisher = Society for Psychical Research |date=October 2005 | url = | doi = | id = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Alpha Mystery |journal=FATE Magazine |date=2000-07-01 |first=José |last=Feola |volume= |issue= |pages= |id= |url=http://www.llewellyn.com/archive/fate/38/ |format= |accessdate=2007-09-22 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701231855/http://www.llewellyn.com/archive/fate/38/ |archivedate=2007-07-01 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Portable digital voice recorders are currently the technology of choice for some EVP investigators. Since some of these devices are very susceptible to Radio Frequency (RF) contamination, EVP enthusiasts sometimes try to record EVP in RF- and sound-screened rooms.&lt;ref name="Chisholm"&gt;{{cite web | last = Chisholm | first = Judith | title = A Short History of EVP | publisher = Psychic World | year = 2000 | url = http://www.psychicworld.net/EVP3.htm | accessdate = 2006-12-03 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070211082252/http://www.psychicworld.net/EVP3.htm |archivedate= 2007-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some EVP enthusiasts describe hearing the words in EVP as an ability, much like learning a new language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=You can Hear Dead People |journal=Fate |date=2001-02-01 |first= |last=Konstantinos |volume= |issue= |pages= |id= |url=http://www.llewellyn.com/archive/fate/95/ |format= |accessdate=2007-09-21 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928044750/http://www.llewellyn.com/archive/fate/95/ |archivedate=2007-09-28 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Skeptics suggest that the claimed instances may be misinterpretations of natural phenomena, inadvertent influence of the electronic equipment by researchers, or deliberate influencing of the researchers and the equipment by third parties. EVP and ITC are seldom researched within the [[scientific community]], so most research in the field is carried out by amateur researchers who lack training and resources to conduct scientific research, and who are motivated by subjective notions.&lt;ref name=Baruss /&gt;

==Explanations and origins==
[[Paranormal]] claims for the origin of EVP include living humans imprinting thoughts directly on an electronic medium through [[psychokinesis]]&lt;ref name="jahn1"&gt;{{cite book | last = Jahn | first = Robert G. | authorlink = |author2=Dunne, Brenda J. | title = Margins of Reality: The Role of Consciousness in the Physical World | publisher = Harcourt Brace Jovanovich |year= 1987 | location = San Diego, California | pages = | url = | doi = | isbn = 0-15-157148-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and communication by discarnate entities such as spirits,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.friendly-ghosts.com/faqs.html|title=EVPs - Questions &amp; Answers|website=www.friendly-ghosts.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517150243/http://www.friendly-ghosts.com/faqs.html|archivedate=2008-05-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Group analyzes paranormal activity|journal=The Collegian|date= October 26, 2004 |first=Josh|last=Josh Bosack|volume=|issue=|pages=|id= |url=|format=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; nature energies, beings from other dimensions, or [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrials]].&lt;ref name="Voices-ET"&gt;[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080618050650/http://aaevp.com/voices_of_eternity_web.pdf Estep, Sarah, "''Voices Of Eternity''," page 144]&lt;/ref&gt; Paranormal explanations for EVP generally assume production of EVP by a communicating intelligence through means other than the typical functioning of [[communication technology|communication technologies]]. Natural explanations for reported instances of EVP tend to dispute this assumption explicitly and provide explanations which do not require novel mechanisms that are not based on recognized [[observation|scientific phenomena]].

One study, by psychologist [[Imants Barušs]], was unable to replicate suggested paranormal origins for EVP recorded under controlled conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Baruss, Imants (2001). "Failure to Replicate Electronic Voice Phenomenon," ''Journal of Scientific Exploration'', Vol. 15, No. 3, pp. 355–367, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brian Regal]] in ''Pseudoscience: A Critical Encyclopedia'' (2009) has written "A case can be made for the idea that many EVPs are artifacts of the recording process itself with which the operators are unfamiliar. The majority of EVPS have alternative, nonspiritual sources; anomalous ones have no clear proof they are of spiritual origin."&lt;ref&gt;Regal, Brian (2009). ''Pseudoscience: A Critical Encyclopedia''. Greenwood. p. 62. {{ISBN|978-0-313-35507-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural explanations===

There are a number of simple scientific explanations that can account for why some listeners to the static on audio devices may believe they hear voices, including radio interference and the tendency of the human brain to recognize patterns in random stimuli.&lt;ref name="skepdic1"&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| title =EVP| work =Skeptic's Dictionary| publisher =| url =http://skepdic.com/evp.html| doi =| accessdate =2006-12-01| deadurl =no| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20061130171118/http://skepdic.com/evp.html| archivedate =2006-11-30| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some recordings may be hoaxes created by frauds or pranksters.&lt;ref name="skepdic1"/&gt;

====Psychology and perception====

''Auditory [[pareidolia]]'' is a situation created when the brain incorrectly interprets random patterns as being familiar patterns.&lt;ref&gt;Wiggins Arthur W. Wynn Charles M. (2001), "Quantum Leaps in the Wrong Direction: Where Real Science Ends and Pseudoscience Begins", National Academies Press, {{ISBN|0-309-07309-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of EVP it could result in an observer interpreting random noise on an audio recording as being the familiar sound of a human voice.&lt;ref name="skepdic1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Zusne |first=Leonard |author2=Warren H. Jones |title=Anomalistic Psychology: A Study of Magical Thinking |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates |year=1989 |isbn=0-8058-0508-7 |page=78 |url=https://books.google.com/books?visbn=0-8058-0508-7 |accessdate=2007-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shermer|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Shermer|date=May 2005|title=Turn Me On, Dead Man: What do the Beatles, the Virgin Mary, Jesus, Patricia Arquette and Michael Keaton all have in common?|journal=[[Scientific American]]|publisher=Scientific American Inc.|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=turn-me-on-dead-man|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110319161949/https://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=turn-me-on-dead-man|archivedate=2011-03-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The propensity for an apparent voice heard in white noise recordings to be in a language understood well by those researching it, rather than in an unfamiliar language, has been cited as evidence of this,&lt;ref name="skepdic1"/&gt; and a broad class of phenomena referred to by author Joe Banks as ''[[Rorschach inkblot test|Rorschach]] Audio'' has been described as a global explanation for all manifestations of EVP.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Joe Banks "Rorschach Audio", the "Ghost Orchid" CD sleevenotes, PARC / [[Ash International]], 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Joe Banks "Rorschach Audio: A Lecture at [[The Royal Society of British Sculptors]]", ''Diffusion'' 8, pp. 2-6, [[Sonic Arts Network]], 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joe Banks "Rorschach Audio: Ghost Voices and Perceptual Creativity", [[Leonardo Music Journal]] 11, pp. 77-83, The [[MIT Press]], 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joe Banks "Rorschach Audio: Art and Illusion for Sound", ''Strange Attractor Journal'' 1, pp. 124-159, [[Strange Attractor Press]], 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Skeptics such as [[David Federlein]], [[Chris French]], [[Terence Hines]] and [[Michael Shermer]] say that EVP are usually recorded by raising the "[[noise floor]]" – the electrical noise created by all electrical devices – in order to create [[white noise]].  When this noise is [[filter (signal processing)|filtered]], it can be made to produce noises which sound like speech.  Federlein says that this is no different from using a [[wah pedal]] on a guitar, which is a [[Spectral glide|focused sweep filter]] which moves around the spectrum and creates open vowel sounds.  This, according to Federlein, sounds exactly like some EVP.  This, in combination with such things as [[cross modulation]] of radio stations or faulty [[ground loop (electricity)|ground loops]] can cause the impression of paranormal voices.&lt;ref name="SkepDic" /&gt;  The human brain evolved to recognize patterns, and if a person listens to enough noise the brain will detect words, even when there is no intelligent source for them.&lt;ref name=shermer&gt;{{cite news |last=Shermer |first=Michael |title=Turn Me On, Dead Man |date=May 2005 |publisher=[[Scientific American]] |url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=000EB977-12BE-1264-8F9683414B7FFE9F |accessdate=2007-02-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007142218/http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=000EB977-12BE-1264-8F9683414B7FFE9F |archivedate=2007-10-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCHUW"&gt;{{cite news | first=Huw | last=Williams | title='Ghostly' chatter - fact or fiction? | date=2005-01-06 | work=[[BBC News]] | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/4152805.stm | accessdate=2007-09-23 | language= | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101115073641/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/4152805.stm | archivedate=2010-11-15 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Expectation also plays an important part in making people believe they are hearing voices in random noise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hines, Terence|authorlink =Terence Hines|title=Pseudoscience and the Paranormal|page=111|publisher=[[Prometheus Books]]|year=2003|isbn=1-57392-979-4}} "If one expects to hear voices, constructive perception will produce voices. The voices, not surprisingly, are usually described as speaking in hoarse whispers. The Indians used to believe that the dead spoke as the wind swirled through the trees. The tape recorder has simply brought this illusion into a technological age."&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Apophenia]]'' is related to, but distinct from pareidolia.&lt;ref name="MNAPOP"&gt;" {{cite web |url=http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=39714 |title=Definition of Apophenia |accessdate=2007-09-23 |publisher=[[MedicineNet]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927203747/http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=39714 |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Apophenia is defined as "the spontaneous finding of connections or meaning in things which are random, unconnected or meaningless", and has been put forward as a possible explanation.&lt;ref name=phaedra1&gt;{{cite web|last=Phaedra|title=Believing is seeing|work=The Skeptic Express|publisher=|year=2006|url=http://theskepticexpress.com/Believing_is_seeing.php|accessdate=2007-03-08|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928050048/http://theskepticexpress.com/Believing_is_seeing.php|archivedate=2007-09-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the psychologist [[James Alcock]] what people hear in EVP recordings can best be explained by apophenia, [[Intermodulation|cross-modulation]] or expectation and [[wishful thinking]].

====Physics====

[[Interference (communication)|Interference]], for example, is seen in certain EVP recordings, especially those recorded on devices which contain [[RLC circuit]]ry. These cases represent radio signals of voices or other sounds from broadcast sources.&lt;ref name="tipler"&gt;{{cite book | author= Paul Tipler| title=Physics for Scientists and Engineers: Electricity, Magnetism, Light, and Elementary Modern Physics (5th ed.) | publisher=W. H. Freeman | year=2004 | isbn=0-7167-0810-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interference from [[citizens band radio|CB Radio transmissions]] and wireless baby monitors, or anomalies generated through [[cross modulation]] from other electronic devices, are all documented phenomena.&lt;ref name="skepdic1"/&gt; It is even possible for [[Crystal radio|circuits]] to [[resonance|resonate]] without any internal power source by means of [[radio receiver|radio reception]].&lt;ref name="tipler"/&gt;

''Capture errors'' are anomalies created by the method used to capture audio signals, such as noise generated through the over-amplification of a signal at the point of recording.&lt;ref name="skepdic1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="signal"&gt;Smith, Steven W. (2002) ''Digital Signal Processing - A Practical Guide for Engineers and Scientists'', Newnes, {{ISBN|0-7506-7444-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Digital artifact|Artifacts]] created during attempts to boost the clarity of an existing recording might explain some EVP.  Methods include re-sampling, frequency isolation, and noise reduction or enhancement, which can cause recordings to take on qualities significantly different from those that were present in the original recording.&lt;ref name="skepdic1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gentile&gt;[[James Randi|Randi, James]] (2006-06-09), ''[http://www.randi.org/jr/2006-06/060906just.html#i1 Just Where is Lou Gentile?],&lt;/ref&gt;

The very first EVP recordings may have originated from the use of tape recording equipment with poorly aligned erasure and recording heads, resulting in the incomplete erasure of previous audio recordings on the tape. This could allow a small percentage of previous content to be superimposed or mixed into a new 'silent' recording.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/1997_articles/may97/analysinganalogue.html?print=yes|title=More Past SOS Articles coming... -|website=www.soundonsound.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120925190009/http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/1997_articles/may97/analysinganalogue.html?print=yes|archivedate=2012-09-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}&lt;!-- Original research?  The source does not seem to mention EVP at all --&gt;

====Sporadic meteors and meteor showers====

For all radio transmissions above 30&amp;nbsp;MHz (which are not reflected by the ionosphere) there is a possibility of meteor reflection of the radio signal.&lt;ref name="Harvey&amp;Bohlman"&gt;P Harvey &amp; KJ Bohlman. Stereo radio F.M. Handbook, Chapter 7, 1974&lt;/ref&gt; Meteors leave a trail of ionised particles and electrons as they pass through the upper atmosphere (a process called ablation) which reflect transmission radio waves which would usually flow into space.&lt;ref name="Manning"&gt;L.A. Manning et al., Determination of ionospheric electron distribution, Proc Inst Radio Engineers Vol 37, pp599-603 (1949)&lt;/ref&gt; These reflected waves are from transmitters which are below the horizon of the received meteor reflection.  In Europe this means the brief scattered wave may carry a foreign voice which can interfere with radio receivers.  Meteor reflected radio waves last between 0.05 seconds and 1 second, depending on the size of the meteor.&lt;ref name="Lovell"&gt;{{cite book|author=A.B.C. Lovell|title=Meteor Astronomy|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1954}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations that show interest in EVP==
There are a number of organizations dedicated to studying EVP and instrumental transcommunication, or which otherwise express interest in the subject. Individuals within these organizations may participate in investigations, author books or journal articles, deliver presentations, and hold conferences where they share experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atransc.org/resources/aaevp_conference.html|title=2006 AA-EVP Conference - ATransC|date=14 September 2016|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20140809174644/http://atransc.org/resources/aaevp_conference.html|archivedate=9 August 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition organizations exist which dispute the validity of the phenomena on scientific grounds.&lt;ref name=Gentile/&gt;

==Cultural impact==
The concept of EVP has influenced popular culture. It is popular as an entertaining pursuit, as in [[ghost hunting]], and as a means of dealing with grief. It has influenced literature, radio, film, television, and music.

''[[Legion (Blatty novel)|Legion]]'', a 1983 novel by [[William Peter Blatty]], contains a subplot where Dr. Vincent Amfortas, a terminally ill neurologist, leaves a "to-be-opened-upon-my-death" letter for Lt. Kinderman detailing his accounts of contact with the dead, including the doctor's recently deceased wife, Ann, through EVP recordings. Amfortas' character and the EVP subplot do not appear in the film version of the novel, ''[[The Exorcist III]]'', although in Kinderman's dream dead people are seen trying to communicate with the living by radio.

In ''[[Pattern Recognition (novel)|Pattern Recognition]]'', a 2003 novel by [[William Gibson]], the main character's mother tries to convince her that her father is communicating with her from recordings after his death/disappearance in the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]].'

=== Theater and music ===
In ''[[Nyctivoe]]'' a 2001 vampire-inspired play by [[Dimitris Lyacos]] the male character as well as his deceased companion are speaking from a recording device amidst a static/white noise background.

In ''[[With the people from the bridge]]'', a 2014 play by [[Dimitris Lyacos]] based on the idea of the return of the dead, the voice of the female character NCTV is transmitted from a television monitor amidst a static/white noise background.

EVP is the subject of [[Vyktoria Pratt Keating]]'s song "Disembodied Voices on Tape" from her 2003 album ''Things that Fall from the Sky'', produced by [[Andrew Giddings]] of [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]].

[[Laurie Anderson]]'s "Example #22", from her 1981 album ''[[Big Science (Laurie Anderson album)|Big Science]],'' interposes spoken sentences and phrases in German with sung passages in English representing EVP.

During the outro to "Rubber Ring" by [[The Smiths]], a sample from an EVP recording is repeated. The phrase "You are sleeping, you do not want to believe," is a 'translation' of the 'spirit voices' from a 1970s flexitape. The original recording is from the 1971 record which accompanied Raudive's book 'Breakthrough', and which was re-issued as a flexi-disc in the 1980s free with The Unexplained magazine.

[[Bass Communion]]'s 2004 album [[Ghosts on Magnetic Tape]] was inspired by EVP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stevenwilsonhq.com/sw/back-catalogue-bass-communions-ghosts-on-magnetic-tape-2/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816045630/http://stevenwilsonhq.com/sw/back-catalogue-bass-communions-ghosts-on-magnetic-tape-2/ |archivedate=2016-08-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The band Giles Corey, founded by Dan Barrett composed a song called 'Empty Churches' which features track 2 called 'Raymond Cass', track 36 called 'Justified Theft' and track 38 called 'Tramping' from the album An Introduction to EVP by The Ghost Orchid which features excerpts from different EVP experiments produced by many researchers, although most are unknown, some have been pointed out to be more known researchers who studied EVP recordings including Friedrich Jurgenson, Raymond Cass and Konstantin Raudive.

In 2017 in Poland was published music cd ′′′Katharsis (A Small Victory)′′′ of [[Teatr Tworzenia]] by [[Jarosław Pijarowski]] with background recorded used EVP recordings (second track - „Katharsis – Pandemonium”).

'''Haplogroup A-P305''' also known as '''A1''' is a [[Human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup]]. Like its parent haplogroup [[haplogroup A0-T]] (A-L1085), A1 includes the vast majority of living human males. It emerged in [[Africa]] approximately 161,300 years ago. &lt;ref name="yfull"/&gt; By comparison, members of its sole sibling [[subclade]], [[haplogroup A0]] – the only other primary subclade of haplogroup A0-T – are found mostly in  

Basal, undivergent A-P305* is largely restricted to populations native to [[Africa]], though a handful of cases have been reported in [[Europe]] and [[Western Asia]]. A-P305* is found at its highest rates in [[Gyele people|Bakola Pygmies]] (South [[Cameroon]]) at 8.3% and [[Berbers]] from [[Algeria]] at 1.5%&lt;ref name="Cruciani2011"/&gt; and in [[Ghana]].&lt;ref name="Scozzari2012"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Scozzari R, Massaia A, D'Atanasio E, etal |title=Molecular dissection of the basal clades in the human Y chromosome phylogenetic tree |journal=PLOS ONE |volume=7 |issue=11 |pages=e49170 |year=2012 |pmid=23145109 |pmc=3492319 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0049170 |url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0049170}}&lt;/ref&gt; The clade also achieves high frequencies in the [[Bushmen]] [[hunter-gatherer]] populations of [[Southern Africa]], followed closely by many [[Nilotic]] groups in [[Eastern Africa]].

'''[[Human leukocyte antigen]]s''' (HLA) began as a list of [[antigen]]s identified as a result of transplant rejection. The antigens were initially identified by categorizing and performing massive statistical analyses on interactions between blood types.&lt;ref name="Davis"&gt;Davis, Daniel M. The Compatibility Gene. How Our Bodies Fight Disease, Attract Others, and Define Our Selves. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2014. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; This process is based upon the principle of [[serotypes]]. HLA are not typical antigens, like those found on surface of [[infectious agent]]s. HLAs are [[Alloimmunity|''allo''antigens]], they vary from individual to individual as a result of genetic differences.
An organ called the [[thymus]] is responsible for ensuring that any [[T-cells]] that attack self proteins are not allowed to live. In essence, every individual's immune system is tuned to the specific set of HLA and self proteins produced by that individual; where this goes awry is when tissues are transferred to another person. Since individuals almost always have different "banks" of HLAs, the immune system of the recipient recognizes the transplanted tissue as non-self and destroys the foreign tissue, leading to [[transplant rejection]]. It was through the realization of this that HLAs were discovered.

The thought that the mammalian body must have some way of identifying introduced foreign tissues first arose during [[World War II]]. It started with a plane crash in the height of the [[The Blitz|London Blitz]]. The pilot suffered severe burns requiring skin grafts; however, skin grafts were a risky business at the time, often being rejected for unknown reasons.&lt;ref name="Davis"/&gt; Numerous theories were proposed and it wasn't until 1958 that the first of these "identifying" proteins was found.&lt;ref&gt;Irene Park, Paul Terasaki, Origins of the first HLA specificities, Human Immunology, Volume 61, Issue 3, March 2000, Pages 185-189 {{DOI|10.1016/S0198-8859(99)00154-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first standardized naming system was established in 1968 by the [[WHO]] Nomenclature Committee for Factors of the HLA System.&lt;ref name="HLA Nomenclature"&gt;"HLA Nomenclature @ Hla.alleles.org." HLA Nomenclature @ Hla.alleles.org. Anthony Nolan Research Institute, 10 Nov. 2013. Web. 08 Dec. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; HLA research didn't heat up until the 1980s when a group of researchers finally elucidated the shape of the HLA-A*02 protein (just one of many specific HLA proteins).&lt;ref name="Davis"/&gt; Even more recently, in 2010, the WHO committee responsible for naming all HLA proteins revised their standards for naming to introduce more clarity and specificity in the naming system.&lt;ref name="HLA Nomenclature" /&gt;

[[File:Peter Brian Medawar.jpg|framed|left|Peter Medawar- The first to truly explore immune rejection and the man who got the ball rolling for modern immunology]]

===Identification of Non-Self===

[[Peter Medawar]] was a zoologist turned clinician, who specialized in burn trauma. A plane crash near his home changed the path of his career, turning his work with burns from mere academia to a full on quest to save lives. Medawar and a Scottish surgeon, Tom Gibson, were tasked with working the Burns Unit of the Glasgow Royal Infirmary. The first insight came when the pair decided to experiment, and grafted part of a wound with the patient's skin, and another part with skin from the patient's brother. Within days the skin grafts from the brother were completely destroyed. Successive skin grafts from the brother were destroyed even faster, a fact that gave them the evidence they needed to implicate the immune system. Medawar later repeated this experiment on rabbits and 625 surgeries later validated their initial conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;Medawar, P. B. "A second study of the behaviour and fate of skin homografts in rabbits: a report to the War Wounds Committee of the Medical Research Council. ''Journal of Anatomy'' 1945; 79, 157-76&lt;/ref&gt; Medawar then set out in search of the reason why rabbits rejected non-self grafts.&lt;ref name="Davis"/&gt;

Medawar continued his work, this time with a team of three at the University College London during the 1950s. Medawar's coworkers were [[Leslie Brent]], a PhD student, and [[Rupert Billingham]], Medawar's first graduate student at Oxford several years prior. Through carefully planned experimentation, the trio showed that mice exposed to cells of unrelated mice as fetuses did ''not'' reject skin grafts from those same mice.&lt;ref&gt;Billingham, R.E., Brent, L. and Medawar, P.B. "Quantitative studies on tissue transplantation immunity. iii. Actively acquired tolerance. ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B Biological Sciences'' 1956; 239, 357-414&lt;/ref&gt; For this discovery, Medawar and Australian scientist [[Frank Macfarlane Burnet|Macfarlane Burnet]] earned the 1960 Nobel Prize.&lt;ref name="Davis"/&gt;

2. Immature lymphocytes with various receptors 
3. "Self"-antigens from the body's tissues 
4. Mature, inactive lymphocytes 
5. Foreign antigen

===Learned Self Tolerance===

Burnet, independently of Medawar, came to the conclusion that the immune system must learn to tolerate any self cells, and hypothesized that this must occur during fetal development. For this, he jointly was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1960. Burnet's work continued and in 1957 along with [[Niels Jerne]] published a paper that modified and revolutionized antibody theory. "Burnet speculated that one cell makes one particular shape of antibody and that all our antibody-making immune cells together make an unimaginably vast repertoire of 10 billion antibodies, each having a slightly different shape".&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Daniel M. The Compatibility Gene. How Our Bodies Fight Disease, Attract Others, and Define Our Selves. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2014. Print. pg 34&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, whenever a non-self molecule appears in the human body, one of these antibodies will have an accurate enough shape to bind to that molecule. This idea is known as [[Clonal selection|Clonal Selection Theory]]. At the time, many leading scientists including [[Linus Pauling]] and [[James Watson]] completely rejected the idea, but repeated experimentation intended to disprove the theory actually served to build up a large body of evidence supporting Burnet and Jerne's theory.&lt;ref name="Davis"/&gt;

The biggest weakness in Burnet's theory was that he had no explanation for how the body selected for immune cells that only identified non-self. In 1961, [[Jacques Miller]] published a paper offering an explanation. Miller was a PhD student at the Chester Beatty Research Institute in London. His discovery centered on the thymus. The thymus had long been regarded as nothing more than a repository for dead cells. Miller didn't buy this hypothesis. By removing the thymus of leukemic mice early in life, he found that the mice had a drastically weakened immune system. Taking inspiration from Medawar's skin transplant work, he performed a series of skin-graft experiments that showed that these immunocompromised mice didn't reject skin grafts from non-genetically identical mice. Miller then hypothesized that the thymus was essential in the construction and maintenance of the immune system. At this point Burnet came back into the picture, extending the hypothesis to specify that the dead cells found in the thymus are not any old immune cells, but instead the cells that are activated by self molecules. In other words, any molecule that binds to and hence "recognizes" a self molecule is killed before exiting the thymus. These cells were later found to be one of two types of immune cells, the [[T-cells]] (named for their origin, the thymus).&lt;ref name="Davis"/&gt;

===Identification of the first HLAs===

The discovery of the first HLA was very much a mystery. In 1958 Jean Dausset noticed that blood serum from one person could react with the white blood cells of another. He had no idea why, but he named the causative agent MAC. Around the same time other researchers were making similar discoveries. Rose Payne and Jon van Rood made an identical conclusion from observations of interactions between the blood of women who had been pregnant multiple times and the white blood cells of others. They hypothesized that this was because they had been "sensitized" (an immunological term meaning previously exposed to and thus more reactive towards) to the non-self proteins of the father through tissue damage during birth. At this point the researchers all realized that the sheer quantity of data they were capable of obtaining was vastly greater than that of any previous study and so collaboration would be essential. The first international meeting, in 1964, highlighted the difficulties of such massive collaborative work. Different experimental methods and inconsistency in the execution of the same tests and a non-homogeneity of naming systems added together to make collaboration incredibly difficult.

===World Health Organization steps in===

In 1967 the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) decided that the HLA research needed an official naming system. This in turn would aid in organization and would more easily facilitate the unification of data being collected at numerous laboratories across the world. This committee is still in existence today and vastly accelerated the rate of HLA research. The first meeting of this committee in 1968 set forth guidelines and rules that govern HLAs. First, compatibility genes were divided into two types, class I and class II. Class I molecules were identified via reactions between blood serum and cells. Class II molecules were identified by mixtures of white blood cells. Second, the compatibility genes were renamed Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLA).&lt;ref name="Davis"/&gt; Despite this clarification and the ever-increasing number of identified HLAs, nobody knew how they worked.

===MHC Restriction===

The red line between them signifies a peptide (in this case an E1A heteroclitic variant of melanoma peptide).

"T-cell Receptor Specificity Maintained by Altered Thermodynamics." Journal of Biological Chemistry 288 (June 2013): 18766-18775.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Late in 1973 a pair of researchers in Australia, Rolf Zinkernagel and Peter Doherty made a revelatory discovery that altered the thinking of immunologists forever. The pair was doing research on viral infections in mice and noticed that T-cells that prevented viral infections in some mice wouldn't always prevent the same infection in other mice. After looking at the MHCs present in the mice, they realized that cytotoxic T-cells could only identify virus infections in cells with the right Class I compatibility gene. Traditional thinking was that the immune system identified infections directly but this discovery turned that theory on its head. Compatibility genes were essential in immune system mediated viral clearing. The pair coined the term "MHC Restriction" to describe this relationship between T-cells, specific MHC proteins, and viral detection.&lt;ref name="Davis"/&gt; In 1975, in an article in the journal ''Lancet'', they introduced the idea of "altered self", meaning that viruses alter the MHC proteins and this alteration is detected by T-cells.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, P.C. and Zinkernagel, R.M. A biological role for the major histocompatibility antigens. ''Lancet'' I, 1406-9 (1975).&lt;/ref&gt; For their work they won the 1996 Nobel Prize.&lt;ref name="Davis"/&gt; It took the work of many others to determine how T-cells made this identification.
{{further|T cell|MHC Restriction}}

===Discovering the protein shape===

Nearly all important molecules in the body are [[proteins]]. Proteins work by each having a specific sequence of [[amino acids]] and a specific shape. Determining the order of amino acids is relatively simple. Finding the shape requires the use of [[x-ray crystallography]] and is anything but easy.&lt;ref name="Cell Biology"&gt;Alberts, Bruce. Essential Cell Biology. New York: Garland Science, 2009. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; It took a team of three researchers at Harvard, [[Don Wiley]], [[Jack Strominger]], and [[Pamela Bjorkman]], eight years to ferret out the structure of the HLA protein. They worked specifically with HLA-A*02. Bjorkman did the majority of the leg work and in the seven years managed to piece together the structure of 90% of the protein. That last 10% was elusive though. It took another year of work to finally unveil the complete structure of HLA-A*02. They completed their work in the spring of 1987, discovering that the final 10% made a "cup" (of sorts) located on top of the molecule. It was the perfect size to hold peptides. Other researchers had previously determined that T-Cells can recognize cells infected with a virus, cells injected with a single protein from a virus, and even cells injected with pieces of protein from a virus. The discovery of the HLA protein structure made it starkly clear that the HLA proteins hold viral peptides in their binding groove. But the research team from Harvard wasn't done. They also observed that there was clearly a peptide in the binding groove of the HLA molecules they used to determine the shape. However, the cells they had extracted the protein from were definitely not infected by any disease causing viruses.&lt;ref name="Davis"/&gt; The conclusion they made and the conclusion that has stuck to this day, is that HLA molecules can bind both self, and non-self peptides.

==={{anchor|Current HLA naming system}} Current HLA naming system===

The most recent HLA naming system was developed in 2010 by the WHO Committee for Factors of the HLA System. There are two types of MHCs, Class I and Class II. Both are named using the same system. Currently there are 7,678 Class I [[alleles]] and 2,268 Class II alleles.

[[File:HLA Naming Protocol.png|framed|HLA naming protocol&lt;ref name="HLA Nomenclature"/&gt;]]
HLA Naming can be quite confusing at first. All alleles start with "HLA", signifying they are part of the human MHC genes. The next portion (HLA'''-A''' or HLA'''-B''') identifies which gene the allele is a modification of. The first two numbers (HLA-A'''*02''') signifies what antigen type that particular allele is, which typically signifies the serological antigen present.&lt;ref name="HLA Nomenclature"/&gt; In other words, HLAs with the same antigen type (HLA-A*02:101 and HLA-A*02:102) will not react with each other in serological tests. The next set of digits (HLA-A*02''':101''') indicates what protein the allele codes for, and these are numbered sequentially in the order they are discovered. Any HLA that has a different number here produces a different protein (AKA has a nucleotide change that replaces an amino acid with another). The third set of numbers (HLA-A*02:101''':01''') indicates an allele variant that has a different DNA sequence but produces the same protein as the normal gene. The final set of numbers (HLA-A*02:101:01''':01''') is used to designate a single or multiple nucleotide polymorphism in a non-coding region of the gene. The final aspect of HLA naming is a letter (HLA-A*02:101:01:01'''L'''). There are six letters, each with a different meaning.

===Establishing the system===

A person can have 2 antigen proteins per genetic-locus (one gene from each parent). When first discovered, identified antigens were clustered, creating groups in which no more than two antigens per cluster were found in a given person. Serotype group "A" consisted HL-A1, A2, A3, A9, A10, A11. Another cluster, "B", contained A7, A8, A12, A13, A14, A15. HL-A4 antigen was found to occur on lymphoid cells. Since the "HL-Antigens" no longer belonged to a single group, a new naming system was needed.

In 1968 the WHO Nomenclature Committee for Factors of the HLA System first met.&lt;ref name="HLA Nomenclature"/&gt; They established a system that divided the HLAs into HLA-A and HLA-B, A and B corresponding to a group of reactive serotypes. For example, "HL-A2" became [[HLA-A2]], "HL-A7" became [[HLA-B7]] and "HL-A8" became [[HLA-B8]].

In this arrangement there were cells that were 'blank' or had new [[Antigen-antibody interaction|specificities]], these new antigens were called "W" antigens, and as they were reassigned to new groups, for example "A" serotypes, they became Aw or Bw antigens. It was found that some antigens that behaved like A and B antigens but could be excluded based on '2-type max' exclusion. Thus a new group, "C" was created. Classification of [[HLA-C|C]] antigens is still ongoing, and they have retained the name Cw as many serotypes have not been developed.

The classification of the "A4" antigens was complicated. The "A4" subset evolved to become D-region antigens, which was a large cluster of genes that encoded MHC class II. Several renamings occurred. The D-region has 8 major coding loci that combine to form 3 different protein groups; DP, DQ, and DR. DRw antigens were the first to be split, a process made easy by the virtue of having an invariant alpha chain, but complicated by 4 beta chain loci (DRB1, DRB3, DRB4, and DRB5). Serotypes to DQ reacted with alpha and beta chains, or both of certain isoforms. The proper classification was greatly aided by gene sequencing and PCR. Classification and description of DP antigens is ongoing.

==Genetics==

===Genetic complexity typifies HLA===
The naming of [[human leukocyte antigens]] HLA "[[antigen]]s" is deeply rooted in the discovery history of their [[serotype]]s and [[allele]]s. There is no doubt that HLA terminology can be bewildering, this terminology is a consequence of the complex genetics as well as the way these antigens were characterized.

Historical perspective is important to an understanding of how the HLA were systematized. In organ transplant the goal was to explain graft rejection for recipients, and of course, to prevent future rejection. From this perspective, the cause of rejections were found to be "antigens". In the same way bacterial antigens can cause inflammatory response, HLA antigens from the donor of the organ caused an inflammatory response when placed in a recipient. This is called allograft [allo = different, graft(medical) = transplant] rejection.

To explain rejection in a nutshell, certain immune system components are highly variable, the agents are called the Major histocompatibility (MHC) antigens. MHC antigens cause rejection of improperly matched organ transplants. The variability stems from genetics. From the perspective of human evolution, why are antigens of the MHC so variable when many other human proteins lack variability? The cause of host-versus-graft-disease may actually stem from the functions of the system.

The use of the word alloantigen actually masks the fact that HLA are infrequently autoantigens in the donor, and therefore their function is not as antigens, but something else. But the naming of these antigens is not borne out of function but the need to match organ donors with recipients.

====Transplantation and transplant rejection====
[[File:Alloreactive Antisera.PNG|frame|left|'''A simple example of HLA antigen causing rejection''' &lt;br /&gt; A1, A2, B7, B8 do not cause reaction because they are in both donor and recipient, DR2 and DR3 are found on lymphoid cells]]
In the early 1960s, some physicians began more aggressive attempts at [[organ transplantation]]. Knowing little about ''compatibility factors'', they attempted transplantation between humans and between non-humans and humans.&lt;ref name="pmid14081245"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Reemtsma K, Mccracken BH, Schlegel JU, Pearl M | title = Heterotransplantation of the kidney: two clinical experiences | journal = Science | volume = 143 | issue = 3607| pages = 700–2 | year = 1964 | pmid = 14081245 | doi =10.1126/science.143.3607.700 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Immunosuppressive drugs]] worked for a time, but transplanted organs would either always fail or the patients would die from infections. Patients received skin, [[white blood cell]] or kidney donations from other donors (called [[allograft]]s, meaning 'of different genetics' grafts). If these [[allograft]]s were rejected, it was found that the 'rejection' response was accompanied by an [[antibody]] mediated [[agglutination (biology)]] of red blood cells (See figure).&lt;ref name="pmid4866325"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rapaport FT, Kano K, Milgrom F | title = Heterophile antibodies in human transplantation | journal = J. Clin. Invest. | volume = 47 | issue = 3 | pages = 633–42 | year = 1968 | pmid = 4866325 | doi =10.1172/JCI105759 | pmc = 297209 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The search for these cell surface antigens began. There are several processes by which antibodies can reduce function: 
* [[Transplant rejection#Acute rejection|Acute rejection - Antibodies]] could attract lymphocytes and cause them to lyse cells via the immune system's [[classical complement pathway]]
* Antibodies could bind to and alter function (e.g., flow of a fluid, or prevention of binding of ligands to receptors)
* [[Cytokine]] responses that cause systemic responses.

=====Different antigens can be identified=====
In the accompanying figure, two similar [[haplotype]]s (unknown to early clinicians) are identical, except for the one ''antigen'' in the top haplotype. The transplant may not be rejected, but if rejection does occur that allotypic protein, the allo''[[antigen]]'', in the donor tissue may have induced the dominant allo-reactive antibody in the recipient.

=====Assaying antiserum=====
[[File:Anti-HLA agglutinated RBC.png|frame|right|'''Agglutination of [[HLA-A3]] positive [[red blood cell]]s''' (RBCs) with anti-A3 alloreactive [[antisera]] containing Anti-A3 [[IgM]]]]
'''Hemagglutination assay'''. In generating an immune response to an antigen, the [[B-cell]]s go through a process of maturation, from surface IgM production, to serum IgM production, to maturation into a [[plasma cell]] producing IgG. Graft recipients who generate an immune response have both IgM and IgG. The IgM can be used directly in [[hemagglutination]] assays, depicted on the right. IgM has 10 antigen binding regions per molecule, allowing cross-linking of cells. An antiserum specific for HLA-A3 will then agglutinate HLA-A3 bearing red blood cells if the concentration of IgM in the antiserum is sufficiently high. Alternatively, a second antibody to the invariable (F&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;) region of the IgG can be used to cross-link antibodies on different cells, causing agglutination.

'''Complement fixation assay'''. The [[complement fixation test]] was modified to assay Antiserum mediated RBC lysis.

'''Chromium release assay'''. This assay measures the release of (biological) radioactive chromium from cells as a result of killer cell activity. These cells are attracted to class I antigens that either carry foreign antigens, or are foreign to the immune system.

=====The role of haplotypes in identifying antigens=====

Each person has two HLA [[haplotype]]s, a cassette of genes passed on from each parent. The haplotype frequencies in Europeans are in strong [[linkage disequilibrium]]. This means there are much higher frequencies of certain haplotypes relative to the expectation based on random sorting of gene-alleles.  This aided the discovery of HLA antigens, but was unknown to the pioneering researchers.

In the tables a fortuitous transplant between two unrelated individual has resulted in an antiserum to single alloantigen. By discovering these close-but-non-identical matches, the process with somewhat related haplotypes surface antigens were identified for HLA A, and in the table below, HLA B at the time however these were all grouped together as HL-Antigens. On the left the "B" and "cw" antigens are matched (B and C are close together so if B matches then C likely also matches), but A antigens are not matched. The antisera that is produced by the recipient is most likely to be A3, but if the direction of transplant is reversed A2 is the likely alloantigen. Two of the first three alloantigens are thus readily easy to detect because of the similarity and frequency of the A2-B7 and A3-B7 haplotypes (see example 1).

In these instances, the A1/A2, A2/A3, A1/A3 are matched, decreasing the probability of a rejection because many are linked to a given haplotype. Occasionally the 'recombinant' A1-Cw7-B7(rare), B7 becomes the alloantigen in a recipient with A1-Cw7-B8(common).

This linkage disequilibrium in Europeans explains why A1, A2, A3, "A7"[B7], and "A8"[B8] were identified, first. It would have taken substantially longer to identify other alleles because frequencies were lower, and haplotypes that migrated into the European population had undergone equilibration or were from multiple sources.

This is the genetic background against which scientists tried to uncover and understand the histocompatibility antigens.

====A list of antigens created====
In the late 1960s, scientist began reacting [[blood serum|sera]] from patients with rejecting transplants to donor or 'third party' tissues. Their [[Serum (blood)|sera]] (the liquid part of the blood when blood clots) was sensitized to the cells from donors - it was ''alloreactive''. By testing different anti-sera from recipients they were able to uncover some with unique reactivities. As a result, scientists were able to identify a few antigens. At first the first antigens were called the Hu-1 antigens&lt;ref name="pmid4887739"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bach FH, Amos DB | title = Hu-1: Major histocompatibility locus in man | journal = Science | volume = 156 | issue = 3781 | pages = 1506–8 | year = 1967 | pmid = 4887739 | doi = 10.1126/science.156.3781.1506 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and tentatively tagged as gene products of the Human equivalent of the mouse histocompatibility locus (H2). In 1968, it was discovered that matching these antigens between kidney donor and recipient improved the likelihood of kidney survival in the recipient.&lt;ref name="pmid4876470"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1056/NEJM196809052791001 |vauthors=Patel R, Mickey MR, Terasaki PI | title = Serotyping for homotransplantation. XVI. Analysis of kidney transplants from unrelated donors | journal = N. Engl. J. Med. | volume = 279 | issue = 10 | pages = 501–6 | year = 1968 | pmid = 4876470 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The antigen list still exists,  although it has been reorganized to fit what we have since learned about genetics, refined, and greatly expanded.

====Lymphocyte bearing antigens recognized====
[[File:LAvsA4.PNG|left]]
As the study of these 'rejection' [[Serum (blood)|sera]] and "allo"-antigens progressed, certain patterns in the antibody recognition were recognized. The first major observation, in 1969, was that an allotypic antibodies to "4" ("Four") was only found on lymphocytes, while most of the antigens, termed "LA", recognized most cells in the body.&lt;ref name="pmid5773111"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mann DL, Rogentine GN, Fahey JL, Nathenson SG | title = Molecular heterogeneity of human lymphoid (HL-A) alloantigens | journal = Science | volume = 163 | issue = 3874 | pages = 1460–2 | year = 1969 | pmid = 5773111 | doi = 10.1126/science.163.3874.1460 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This group "4" antigen on lymphocytes would expand into "4a", "4b" and so on, becoming the "D" series (HLA-D (Class II) antigens) DP, DQ, and DR. This is an interesting history in itself.

The Hu-1 antigens were renamed the Human-lymphoid (HL) allo-antigens (HL-As). Allo-antigen comes from the observation that a tolerated protein in the donor becomes antigenic in the recipient. This can be compared with an [[autoantigen]], in which a person develops antibodies to one or more of their own proteins. This also suggested  the donor and recipient have a different genetic makeup for these antigens. The "LA" group thereafter was composed of HL-A1, A2, A3, A5, A6, A7, A8, A9, A10, A11, A12, A13, A14 and A15 until further divisions and renaming were necessary. Some of the antigens above, for example HL-A1, are similar to [[HLA-A1]], as they are the same serotype. Some of the above, like A5, are not mentioned within the last few years, as they have been renamed.

During these early studies it became known that there were associations with many autoimmune diseases. And the [[HLA A1-B8 haplotype]] is linked to a very long piece of conserved chromosome 6 variant called [[HLA A1-B8-DR3-DQ2|AH8.1 haplotype]]. In these studies ''HL-A1,8'' were frequently found co-linked to disease. This linkage is not necessarily a function of either gene, but a consequence of the way AH8.1 evolved.

====Subclassification of lymphoid antigens====
[[File:HL-Series A and B.PNG|right]]
A series of tests on cultured cells revealed that, within the "LA" group, a donor tissue might have some antigens but not others. For example, an antiserum may react with patterns (on a given tissue):

* A1, A2, A7, A12
* A1, A3, A7, A8
* A1, A11, A8, A5
* A1, A8

But fail to react in the following patterns:

* A1, A2, A3, ...
* A1, A2, A11, ....
* A2, A3, A11, ....
* . . . A7, A8, A12

====The HLA serotype series====

=====Series "A"=====
{|style="margin-left:2em;  border:1px #ccffdd solid; background:#ebffef" align="right"
|-
|
{|style="text-align:left; margin-left:1em; background:#ebffef" 
|- align = "center"

|-
| '''Effects of intraseries exclusion'''
|-
| column width = "300px" | Once it was determined that a tissue with two antigens of a series (such as "A") excluded the possibility of a third antigen of the same series, HLA serotypes began to clarify the genetic alleles present in humans. HL-Series "A" antigens became the HLA-A locus gene products, but with exceptions. Some serotypes, such as HL-A1 were so homogeneous in nature that mistaking that serotyped allele (HLA-A*0101) for another allele was unlikely. &lt;br /&gt;
|-
|'''Interpreting Serotypes as Alleles'''
|-
| column width = "300px" | HL-A1 antiserum reacts to [[HLA-A1]] [[gene product]], a cell surface antigen, the similar cell surface antigens are found on almost all cells in the body. The frequency of HLA-A1 alleles is: HLA-A1'''*0101'''- 17.3%, '''*0103'''- 0.016%. The frequency of *0101 is 1000 times more abundant than *0103, or 99.9% of the time you have identified the correct allele with the serotype. The false negative rate for [[HLA-A1#Serotype|HLA-A1 serotype]] is 1% and the giving the HLA-A1 serotyping a [[specificity (tests)|specificity]] of 98.9% for the A1*0101 allele.&lt;br /&gt;
|-
|'''Increasing confidence of Interpretation'''
|-
| column width = "300px" | Sensitivity is lower, particularly in the study of non-caucasians as the HL-A1 can cross-react to similar sites on  [[Genetic recombination|genetic recombinant]]s (most often [[gene conversion]]). Sensitivity can be improved by knowing the haplotype. In Europe, HLA-A1 is strongly linked to a 'chunk of chromosome' called a 'haplotype'. This haplotype, Super-B8, is A1-Cw7-B8-DR3-DQ2, about 2 million DNA codons (the [[nucleotide]] building blocks) long. This chunk has avoided recombination for thousands of years. When the A1 serotype is found with B8 (i.e., the 'old' HL-A8) serotype in Europe, there is an even greater chance the HL-A1 antiserum has detected the A1*0101 allele's gene product. &lt;br /&gt;
|}
|}
If 2 members of the series (A1, 2, 3, 9, 10, 11) were typed, a reaction with a third member of the series to the donor was not observed. This 'exclusivity' identified series "A".&lt;ref&gt;Bach ML, Bach FH. (1970) ''The genetics of histocompatibility''.  ''Hosp. Practice'' 5(8): 33-44&lt;/ref&gt; One might notice the similarities of this numeric series with the [[Template:HLA-A serotypes|HLA-A series]], as series "A" antigens are the first six members of [[HLA-A]]. Inadvertently, the scientist had discovered an antibody set that recognized only [[gene product]]s from one locus, [[HLA-A#HLA-A gene|HLA-A gene]] the "antigens" being the gene products. The implication is that an alloreactive anti-sera can be a tool for genetic identification.

=====Series "B"=====
Not long after the series A antigens were separated from the (rapidly expanding) list of antigens, it was determined another group also could be separated along the same ''logical'' lines.  This group included HL-A5, A7, A8, A12.  This became the series "B".
Note the similarity of Series "B" to the first few members [[Template:HLA-B serotypes|HLA-B serotypes]]. The names of these antigens were necessarily changed to fit the new putative series they were assigned to. From HL-A# to HLA-B#. The problem was that the literature was using "A7" and would soon be using "B7" as shorthand for [[HLA-B7]].

=====Pseudo-series "w"=====
Since it was now certain, by the early 1970s, that the "antigens" were encoded by different series, implicit loci, numeric lists became somewhat cumbersome. Many groups were discovering antigens. In these instances an antigen was assigned a temporary name, like "RoMa2" and after discussion, the next open numeric slot could be assigned, but not to an "A" or "B" series until proper testing had been done. To work around this problem a 'workshop' number "w#" was often assigned while testing continued to determine which series the antigen belonged to.

=====Series "C"=====
Before too long, a series "C" was uncovered. Series C has proved difficult to serotype, and the alleles in the series still carry the "w" tag signifying that status; in addition, it reminds us that Series C were not assigned names the same way as Series A and B, it has its own numeric list Cw1, Cw2, Cw3.

====Serotype group expansion and refinement====
By the mid 1970s, genetic research was finally beginning to make sense of the simple list of antigens, a new series "C" had been discovered and, in turn genetic research had determined the order of HLA-A, C, B and D encoding loci on the human [[chromosome 6|6]]p.&lt;ref name="pmid136874"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yunis EJ, Dupont B, Hansen J | title = Immunogenetic aspects of allotransplantation | journal = Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. | volume = 73 Pt B | issue = | pages = 231–51 | year = 1976 | pmid = 136874 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4684-3300-5_20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With new series came new antigens; Cw1 and 2 were quickly populated, although Cw typing lagged. Almost half of the antigens could not be resolved by serotyping in the early 90s. Currently genetics defines 18 groups.

At this point, Dw was still being used to identify DR, DQ, and DP antigens. The ability to identify new antigens far exceeded the ability to characterize those new antigens.

As technology for transplantation was deployed around the world, it became clear that these antigens were far from a complete set, and in fact hardly useful in some areas of the world (e.g., Africa, or those descended from Africans). Some serotyping antibodies proved to be poor, with broad specificities, and new serotypes were found that identified a smaller set of antigens more precisely. These broad antigen groups, like A9 and B5, were subdivided into "split" antigen groups, A23 &amp; A24 and B51 &amp; B52, respectively. As the HL-A serotyping developed, so did identification of new antigens.

====Genetic identification====
In the early 1980s, it was discovered that a restriction fragment segregates with individuals who bear the [[HLA-B8]] serotype.  By 1990, it was discovered that a single amino acid sequence difference between HLA-B44 (B*4401 versus B*4402) could result in allograft rejection. This revelation appeared to make serotyping based matching strategies problematic if many such differences existed. In the case of B44, the antigen had already been split from the B12 broad antigen group. In 1983, the cDNA sequences of [[HLA-A3]] and [[HLA-Cw3|Cw3]]&lt;ref name="pmid6609814"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Strachan T, Sodoyer R, Damotte M, Jordan BR | title = Complete nucleotide sequence of a functional class I HLA gene, HLA-A3: implications for the evolution of HLA genes | journal = EMBO J. | volume = 3 | issue = 4 | pages = 887–94 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6609814 | doi = | pmc = 557443 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All three sequences compared well with mouse MHC class I antigens. The Western European [[HLA-B7]] antigen had been sequenced (although the first sequence had errors and was replaced). In short order, many HLA class I alleles were sequenced
including 2 Cw1 alleles.&lt;ref name="pmid3375250"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Parham P, Lomen CE, Lawlor DA, etal | title = Nature of polymorphism in HLA-A, -B, and -C molecules | journal = Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. | volume = 85 | issue = 11 | pages = 4005–9 | year = 1988 | pmid = 3375250 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.85.11.4005 | pmc = 280349 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1990, the full complexity of the HLA class I antigens was beginning to be understood. At the time new serotypes were being determined, the problem with multiple alleles for each serotype was becoming apparent by nucleotide sequencing. [[RFLP]] analysis helped determine new alleles, but sequencing was more thorough. Throughout the 1990s, PCR kits, called SSP-PCR kits were developed that allowed, at least under optimal conditions, the purification of DNA, PCR and Agarose Gel identification of alleles within an 8-hour day. Alleles that could not be clearly identified by serotype and PCR could be sequenced, allowing for the refinement of new PCR kits.

Serotypes like B*4401, B*4402, B*4403, each abundant within those with B44 serotypes could be determined with unambiguous accuracy. The molecular genetics has advanced HLA technology markedly over serotyping technology, but serotyping still survives. Serotyping had identified the most similar antigens that now form the HLA subgroups. Serotyping can reveal whether an antigen coded by the relevant HLA gene is expressed. An HLA allele coding non-expressed gene is termed "Null Allele", for example: HLA-B*15:01:01:02N. The expression level can also detected by serotyping, an HLA gene coding for antigens which has low protein expression on the cell surface is termed "Low Expresser", for example: HLA-A*02:01:01:02L.

==Summary==
* [[Lymphoid tissue|Lymphoid]] "antigens" became an experimental [[Iatrogenesis|artifact]] of medical techniques (i.e., of transplantation). Simply, as scientist gained familiarity with the human immune system they learned more about graft rejection, the cause was antibody production to proteins in donor tissue. The key word is allo - which means of different origin. 'Allo'typic proteins in 'allo'grafts developed immune responses in recipients. What makes these proteins different?
* From a more modern perspective, HLA [[gene product]]s (i.e., antigen-presenting, [[cell-surface receptor]]s) did not evolve to be transplantation antigens, nor to interfere with transplantation, organ transplantation being unknown until 1960. The HLA genes are much older. Variation in HLA major antigens is the cause of transplant rejection, but variation at HLA is under preservative selection (Called heterozygous selection or [[balancing selection]]). Variation of HLA has led to an estimate that they are at least 60 million years in age for humans (DRB1).&lt;ref name="pmid8533083"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ayala FJ | title = The myth of Eve: molecular biology and human origins | journal = Science | volume = 270 | issue = 5244 | pages = 1930–6 | year = 1995 | pmid = 8533083 | doi = 10.1126/science.270.5244.1930 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In humans, the number of HLA alleles is expanding, even with many genes, many more are still tolerable as immune presentation antigens.

The scientific problem has been to explain the natural function of a molecule, such as a self [[cell-surface antigen|cell-surface receptor]] involved in [[Immunity (medical)|immunity]]. It also seeks to explain how variation developed (perhaps by evolutionary pressure), and how the genetic mechanisms works ([[dominance (genetics)|dominant]], [[codominant]], [[Dominant gene#Incomplete dominance|semidominant]], or [[recessive]]; [[purifying selection]] or [[balancing selection]]).

The '''history of pseudoscience''' is the study of pseudoscientific theories over time. A [[pseudoscience]] is a set of ideas that presents itself as science, while it does not meet the criteria to properly be called such.&lt;ref&gt;"''Pseudoscientific - pretending to be scientific, falsely represented as being scientific''", from the ''Oxford American Dictionary'', published by the [[Oxford English Dictionary]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://skepdic.com/pseudosc.html The Skeptic's Dictionary entry on 'Pseudoscience']&lt;/ref&gt;

Distinguishing between proper [[science]] and pseudoscience is sometimes difficult. One popular proposal for demarcation between the two is the [[Falsifiability|falsification criterion]], most notably contributed to by the philosopher [[Karl Popper]]. In the history of pseudoscience it can be especially hard to separate the two, because some sciences developed from pseudosciences. An example of this is the science [[chemistry]], which traces its origins from the [[protoscience]] of [[alchemy]].

The vast diversity in pseudosciences further complicates the history of pseudoscience. Some pseudosciences originated in the pre-scientific era, such as [[astrology]] and [[acupuncture]]. Others developed as part of an ideology, such as [[Lysenkoism]], or as a response to perceived threats to an ideology. An example of this is [[creationism]], which was developed as a response to the scientific [[theory of evolution]].

Despite failing to meet proper scientific standards, many pseudosciences survive. This is usually due to a persistent core of [[True-believer syndrome|devotees]] who refuse to accept scientific criticism of their beliefs, or due to popular misconceptions. Sheer popularity is also a factor, as is attested by astrology which remains popular despite being rejected by a large majority of scientists.&lt;ref name="taylor"&gt;{{cite web | title=The Religious and Other Beliefs of Americans 2003 | author=Humphrey Taylor | url=http://www.harrisinteractive.com/harris_poll/index.asp?PID=359 | accessdate=2007-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nsa1"&gt;{{cite web | title= Science and Technology: Public Attitudes and Understanding | publisher=National Science Foundation | url=https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind06/c7/c7s2.htm#c7s2l3 | accessdate=2007-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

==19th century==
[[Image:PhrenologyPix.jpg|thumbnail|250px|right|A [[phrenology]] chart from 1883. During the first half of the 19th century, phrenology was a popular study and considered scientific. By the second half of the century, the theory was largely abandoned.]]

Among the most notable developments in the history of pseudoscience in the 19th century are the rise of [[Spiritualism (beliefs)|Spiritualism]] (traced in America to 1848), [[homeopathy]] (first formulated in 1796), and [[phrenology]] (developed around 1800). Another popular pseudoscientific belief that arose during the 19th century was the idea that there were [[Martian canal|canals visible on Mars]]. A relatively mild Christian fundamentalist backlash against the scientific [[theory of evolution]] foreshadowed subsequent events in the 20th century.

The study of bumps and fissures in people's skulls to determine their character, '''[[phrenology]]''', was originally considered a science. It influenced psychiatry and early studies into neuroscience.&lt;ref name="Simpson 2005"&gt;Simpson, D. (2005) Phrenology and the neurosciences: contributions of F. J. Gall and J. G. Spurzheim ANZ Journal of Surgery. Oxford. Vol.75.6; p.475&lt;/ref&gt; As science advanced, phrenology was increasingly viewed as a pseudoscience. Halfway through the 19th century, the scientific community had prevailingly abandoned it.&lt;ref name="van Wyhe, J."&gt;[http://www.victorianweb.org/science/phrenology/index.html Phrenology: An Overview, by dr. John van Wyhe]&lt;/ref&gt;

Halfway through the century, '''[[iridology]]''' was invented by the Hungarian physician [[Ignaz von Peczely]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://skepdic.com/iridol.html The Skeptic's Dictionary entry on 'Iridology']&lt;/ref&gt; The theory would remain popular throughout the 20th century as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quackwatch.com/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/iridology.html Iridology Is Nonsense], by Stephen Barrett, M.D.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Venice_ast_sm.jpg|thumb|The astrological signs of the zodiac.]]

'''[[Spiritualism (beliefs)|Spiritualism]]''' (sometimes referred to as "Modern Spiritualism" or "Spiritism")&lt;ref name="Podmore"&gt;{{cite journal  | last=Podmore | first=Frank | year=1903 | title=Modern Spiritualism. A History and a Criticism | journal= The American Journal of Psychology | volume=14 | issue=1 | pages=116&amp;ndash;117 | doi=10.2307/1412224 | jstor=1412224 | publisher=[[University of Illinois Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  or "Modern American Spiritualism"&lt;ref name="Britten"&gt;{{Cite book | last=Britten | first=Emma Hardinge | title=Modern American Spiritualism | year=1870 | publisher= | isbn =}}&lt;/ref&gt; grew phenomenally during the period. The American version of this movement has been traced to the [[Fox sisters]] who in 1848 began claiming the ability to communicate with the dead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://skepdic.com/spiritul.html The Skeptic's Dictionary entry on 'Spiritualism']&lt;/ref&gt; The religious movement would remain popular until the 1920s, when renowned magician [[Harry Houdini]] began exposing famous mediums and other performers as frauds (see also [[Harry Houdini#Debunking spiritualists]]). While the religious beliefs of Spiritualism are not presented as science, and thus are not properly considered pseudoscientific, the movement did spawn numerous pseudoscientific phenomena such as [[Ectoplasm (paranormal)|ectoplasm]] and [[spirit photography]].

The principles of '''[[homeopathy]]''' were first formulated in 1796, by German physician [[Samuel Hahnemann]]. At the time, mainstream medicine was a primitive affair and still made use of techniques such as [[bloodletting]]. Homeopathic medicine by contrast consisted of extremely diluted substances, which meant that patients basically received water. Compared to the damage often caused by conventional medicine, this was an improvement.&lt;ref name="pmid8885813"&gt;
{{cite journal |author=[[Edzard Ernst|Ernst E]], Kaptchuk TJ |title=Homeopathy revisited |journal=Arch. Intern. Med. |volume=156 |issue=19 |pages=2162–4 |year=1996 |pmid=8885813 |doi=10.1001/archinte.156.19.2162}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1830s homeopathic institutions and schools spread across the USA and Europe.&lt;ref name=Julian&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wholehealthnow.com/homeopathy_pro/homeopathy_1825_1849.html |title=Homeopathy Timeline |accessdate=2007-07-23 |last=Winston |first=Julian |year=2006 |work=The Faces of Homoeopathy |publisher=Whole Health Now
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these early successes, homeopathy was not without its critics.&lt;ref&gt;Example of a contemporary criticism of homeopathy:{{cite book |author=John Forbes |title=Homeopathy, allopathy and young physic |location=London |year=1846}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its popularity was on the decline before the end of the 19th century, though it has been revived in the 20th century.

The supposed '''[[Martian canal]]s''' were first reported in 1877, by the Italian astronomer [[Giovanni Schiaparelli]]. The belief in them peaked in the late 19th century, but was widely discredited in the beginning of the 20th century.

The publication of ''[[Atlantis: The Antediluvian World]]'' by politician and author [[Ignatius L. Donnelly]] in 1882, renewed interest in the ancient idea of '''[[Atlantis]]'''. This highly advanced society supposedly existed several millennia before the rise of civilizations like [[Ancient Egypt]]. It was first mentioned by [[Plato]], as a literary device in two of his dialogues. Other stories of lost continents, such as [[Mu (lost continent)|Mu]] and [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]] also arose during the late 19th century.

In 1881 the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[Vereniging tegen de Kwakzalverij]] ([[English language|English]]: ''Society against Quackery'') was formed to oppose pseudoscientific trends in medicine. It is still active.

==20th century==
Among the most notable developments to pseudoscience in the 20th century are the rise of [[Creationism]], the demise of [[Spiritualism]], and the first formulation of [[Ancient astronauts|ancient astronaut theories]].

'''[[Reflexology]]''', the idea that an undetectable life force connects various parts of the body to the feet and sometimes the hands and ears, was introduced in the USA in 1913 as 'zone therapy'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quackwatch.com/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/reflex.html Reflexology: A Close Look], by Stephen Barrett, M.D.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://skepdic.com/reflex.html The Skeptic's Dictionary entry on 'Reflexology']&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Creationism]]''' arose during the 20th century as a result of various other historical developments. When the [[modern synthesis (20th century)|modern evolutionary synthesis]] overcame the [[eclipse of Darwinism]] in the first half of the 20th century, American [[fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalist Christians]] began opposing the teaching of the [[theory of evolution]] in public schools. They introduced numerous laws to this effect, one of which was notoriously upheld by the [[Scopes Trial]].
In the second half of the century the [[Space Race]] caused a renewed interest in science and worry that the USA was falling behind on the Soviet Union. Stricter science standards were adopted and led to the re-introduction of the [[theory of evolution]] in the curriculum. The laws against teaching evolution were now ruled unconstitutional, because they violated the [[separation of church and state]]. Attempting to evade this ruling, the Christian fundamentalists produced a supposedly secular alternative to evolution, Creationism. Perhaps the most influential publication of this new pseudoscience was ''[[The Genesis Flood: The Biblical Record and Its Scientific Implications|The Genesis Flood]]'' by [[young earth creationism|young earth creationists]] [[John C. Whitcomb]] and [[Henry M. Morris]].

The dawn of the space age also inspired various versions of '''[[Ancient astronauts|ancient astronaut theories]]'''. While differences between the specific theories exists, they share the idea that intelligent extraterrestrials visited Earth in the distant past and made contact with then living humans. Popular authors, such as [[Erich von Däniken]] and [[Zecharia Sitchin]], began publishing in the 1960s. Among the most notable publications in the genre is ''[[Chariots of the Gods?]]'', which appeared in 1968.

The [[Project Apollo|Apollo]] [[Moon landing]]s from the 1960s through the 70's gave rise to a number of '''[[Apollo Moon Landing hoax conspiracy theories]]'''. These [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] are universally ignored by the scientific community, but at the end of the century a [[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]] poll showed 6 percent of the American population did not believe the landings were genuine.&lt;ref name="gallup1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/1993/Did-Men-Really-Land-Moon.aspx |title=Did Men Really Land on the Moon? |publisher=Gallup.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gallup2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/3712/Landing-Man-Moon-Publics-View.aspx |title=Landing a Man on the Moon: The Public's View |publisher=Gallup.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Late in the 20th century several prominent [[Scientific skepticism|skeptical]] foundations were formed to counter the growth of pseudosciences. In the USA, the most notable of these are, in chronological order, the [[Center for Inquiry]] (1991), [[The Skeptics Society]] (1992), the [[James Randi Educational Foundation]] (1996), and the [[New England Skeptical Society]] (1996). The [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]], which has similar goals, had already been founded in 1976. It became part of the Center for Inquiry as part of the foundation of the latter in 1991. In the Netherlands [[Stichting Skepsis]] was founded in 1987.

==21st century==
At the beginning of the 21st century, a variety of pseudoscientific theories remain popular.

'''Creationism''', in the form of '''[[Intelligent Design]]''', suffered a major legal defeat in the [[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]] trial. Judge [[John E. Jones III]] ruled that Intelligent Design is inseparable from Creationism, and its teaching in public schools violates the [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment]]. The trial sparked much interest, and was the subject of several documentaries including the award-winning [[Nova (TV series)|NOVA]] production ''[[Judgment Day: Intelligent Design on Trial]]'' (2007).

The pseudoscientific idea that '''[[Thiomersal controversy|vaccines cause autism]]''' originated in the 1990s, but became prominent in the media during the first decade of the 21st century. Despite a broad [[scientific consensus]] against the idea that there is a link between [[vaccination]] and [[autism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=European Medicines Agency| authorlink=European Medicines Agency| date=2004-03-24| url=http://www.emea.europa.eu/pdfs/human/press/pus/119404en.pdf| title=EMEA Public Statement on Thiomersal in Vaccines for Human Use| accessdate=2007-07-22| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610154109/http://www.emea.europa.eu/pdfs/human/press/pus/119404en.pdf| archivedate=2007-06-10| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Can Commun Dis Rep|year=2007|volume=33|issue=ACS-6|pages=1–13|title=Thimerosal: updated statement.

Most notable of these is [[Jenny McCarthy]], whose son has autism.
In February 2009, surgeon [[Andrew Wakefield]], who published the original research supposedly indicating a link between vaccines and autism, was reported to have fixed the data by [[The Sunday Times]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | title=MMR doctor Andrew Wakefield fixed data on autism | publisher=The Sunday Times | date=2009-02-08 | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article5683671.ece | accessdate=2009-02-08  | location=London

The most notable development in the '''ancient astronauts''' genre was the opening of Erich von Däniken's [[Mystery Park]] in 2003. While the park had a good first year, the number of visitors was much lower than the expected 500,000 a year. This caused financial difficulties, which led to the closure of the park in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swissinfo.org/eng/top_news/detail/Closure_of_Mystery_Park_is_no_enigma.html?siteSect=106&amp;sid=7266028&amp;cKey=1163955688000 Closure of Mystery Park in Interlaken is no mystery] by swissinfo.ch&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''How to Build a Dinosaur: Extinction Doesn't Have to Be Forever''''' is a 2009 book by paleontologist [[Jack Horner (paleontologist)|Jack Horner]] and James Gorman. The book outlines Horner's theory for being able to resurrect a [[maniraptora]]n dinosaur by altering the genes of a chicken embryo. In 2010, a [[paperback]] version was published under the title '''''How to Build a Dinosaur: The New Science of Reverse Evolution'''''.

==Summary==
Paleontologist [[Jack Horner (paleontologist)|Jack Horner]] describes [[evolutionary developmental biology]] (evo-devo) and outlines his theory for being able to resurrect a [[maniraptora]]n dinosaur from a chicken embryo, by activating and deactivating certain genes to restore dormant dinosaur characteristics such as a tail, claws, teeth, and a snout.&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt;&lt;ref name=Booklist/&gt; Horner also discusses paleontology in the book.&lt;ref name=PW/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kirkus/&gt;

==Background and publication==
Horner's idea for the [[Jack Horner (paleontologist)#Build a Dinosaur project|"Chickenosaurus" project]] came from "a pretty good script" that was written for ''[[Jurassic World|Jurassic Park IV]]'' early in its development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Nick |last=Collins |title=The Jurassic Park scientist who plans to turn a chicken into T Rex |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/dinosaurs/8847499/The-Jurassic-Park-scientist-who-plans-to-turn-a-chicken-into-T-Rex.html |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=October 25, 2011 |accessdate=January 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's story, at that time, was expected to involve genetic engineering of dinosaurs.&lt;ref name=Interview/&gt; Horner was planning the book with co-author James Gorman in spring 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Horner |first1=John R. |first2=James |last2=Gorman |title=How to Build a Dinosaur: The New Science of Reverse Evolution |edition=2010 Plume |year=2010 |publisher=[[Plume (publisher)|Plume]] |location=New York |isbn=0525951040 |oclc=233549535 |pages=193–194 |quote=Let's use the ivory-billed woodpecker as an example.

Horner and his publisher planned for the book to come out at the same time as ''Jurassic Park IV'', to serve as a scientific companion volume;&lt;ref name=Interview&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iw7fSAzv4EU|title= Interview with Dr. Jack Horner|date= April 13, 2017|website= Jurassic Outpost|access-date=May 3, 2017|at=24:50–26:44}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Brian |last=Switek |title=Why Do We Keep Going Back to Jurassic Park? |url=http://beta.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/why-do-we-keep-going-back-to-jurassic-park-117247927/?no-ist |work=Smithsonian |date=October 25, 2011 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140924043612/http://beta.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/why-do-we-keep-going-back-to-jurassic-park-117247927/?no-ist |archivedate=September 24, 2014 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the film was delayed.&lt;ref name=Interview/&gt; Horner's book, in [[hardcover]] form, was ultimately published by [[Dutton Penguin]] on March 19, 2009,&lt;ref name=Amazon/&gt; without the accompaniment of the film.&lt;ref name=Interview/&gt; The book was initially published with the title ''How to Build a Dinosaur: Extinction Doesn't Have to Be Forever''.&lt;ref name=Amazon&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.amazon.com/How-Build-Dinosaur-Extinction-Forever/dp/0525951040|title= How to Build a Dinosaur: Extinction Doesn't Have to Be Forever|publisher= [[Amazon.com]]|access-date=May 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[paperback]] version was published by [[Plume (publisher)|Plume]] on February 23, 2010, with the title ''How to Build a Dinosaur: The New Science of Reverse Evolution''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.amazon.com/How-Build-Dinosaur-Science-Evolution/dp/0452296013/ref=mt_paperback?_encoding=UTF8&amp;me=|title= How to Build a Dinosaur: The New Science of Reverse Evolution|publisher= Amazon.com|access-date=May 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' called the book "provocative but frustrating", writing that aside from the main concept, "Much of the rest of the book offers background, but often digresses, for example, into hunting for DNA from 68-million-year-old dinosaur bones or the surfing habit of the man who discovered the [[polymerase chain reaction]] or how genetically close humans and Neanderthals are—none of which advances the book's central argument."&lt;ref name=PW&gt;{{cite web |url= http://secure.publishersweekly.com/978-0-525-95104-9|title= How to Build a Dinosaur: Extinction Doesn't Have to Be Forever|date= January 26, 2009|website= [[Publishers Weekly]]|access-date=May 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kirkus Reviews]] wrote that the book "has a comfortable, intelligent flow," but noted that Horner first "wants to tell a story—and it's a good one, though at times meandering—about paleontology […]. Horner digresses about [[skinhead]]s, [[Ted Kaczynski]] and chicken carcasses, but his main idea is reverse evolutionary engineering."&lt;ref name=Kirkus&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/Jack-Horner-75227/how-to-build-a-dinosaur/|title= How to Build a Dinosaur|date= January 1, 2009|website= [[Kirkus Reviews]]|access-date=May 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert Taylor of [[Booklist]] wrote, "Straight from the scientific frontier, Horner's work should excite anyone who's dreamed of walking with dinosaurs."&lt;ref name=Booklist&gt;{{cite web |url= http://staging.booklistonline.com/How-to-Build-a-Dinosaur-Extinction-Doesn-t-Have-to-Be-Forever-Jack-Horner/pid=3244338|title= Booklist Review: How to Build a Dinosaur: Extinction Doesn't Have to Be Forever|last= Taylor|first= Gilbert|date= February 15, 2009|website= [[Booklist]]|access-date=May 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brian Switek of ''[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]'' wrote, "The importance of ''How to Build a Dinosaur'' does not lie in Horner's wish to create a dinochicken. That makes up only a small part of the book. Instead the slim volume indicates how paleontology is becoming more of an interdisciplinary science where studies of development and genetics are just as important as fossilized bones."&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/book-review-how-to-build-a-dinosaur-40954950/|title= Book Review: How to Build a Dinosaur|last= Switek|first= Brian|date= March 19, 2009|website= [[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]|archiveurl= https://archive.is/20170503141759/http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/book-review-how-to-build-a-dinosaur-40954950/|archivedate= May 3, 2017|deadurl= yes|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeff Hecht of ''[[New Scientist]]'' wrote that Horner "is at his best" in the book, which he called "provocative yet firmly grounded in science."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20126972-100-review-how-to-build-a-dinosaur-by-jack-horner-and-james-gorman/|title= Review: How to Build a Dinosaur by Jack Horner and James Gorman|last= Hecht|first= Jeff|date= February 25, 2009|website= [[New Scientist]]|access-date=May 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen) was born c. 965 to an Arab&lt;ref name="Vernet 1996 788"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Simon 2006"/&gt; family in [[Basra]], [[Medieval Iraq|Iraq]], 
which was [[Iranian Intermezzo|at the time]] part of the [[Buyid dynasty|Buyid emirate]]. 
He held a position with the title ''vizier'' in his native Basra, and made a name for himself for his knowledge of applied mathematics. 
As he claimed to be able to regulate the [[flooding of the Nile]], he was invited to by [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]] [[Caliphate|Caliph]] [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah|al-Hakim]] in order to realise a [[Hydraulic empire|hydraulic project]] at [[Aswan]]. However, Ibn al-Haytham was forced to concede the impracticability of his project.&lt;ref name="Corbin 1993 149"&gt;{{Harvnb|Corbin|1993|p=149}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Upon his return to Cairo, he was given an administrative post. After he proved unable to fulfill this task as well, he contracted the ire of the caliph [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah]],&lt;ref&gt;The Prisoner of Al-Hakim. Clifton, NJ: Blue Dome Press, 2017. {{ISBN|1682060160}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is said to have been forced into hiding until the caliph's death in 1021, after which his confiscated possessions were returned to him.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl Brockelmann]], ''Geschichte der arabischen Litteratur'', vol. 1 (1898), [https://archive.org/stream/geschichtederar00brocgoog#page/n522/mode/2up p. 469].&lt;/ref&gt;
Legend has it that Alhazen [[feigned madness]] and was kept under house arrest during this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cgie.org.ir/shavad.asp?id=123&amp;avaid=1917 |title=the Great Islamic Encyclopedia |publisher=Cgie.org.ir |accessdate=27 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930153427/http://www.cgie.org.ir/shavad.asp?id=123&amp;avaid=1917 |archivedate=30 September 2011 }}{{verify source|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, he wrote his influential ''[[Book of Optics]]''.
Alhazen continued to live in Cairo, in the neighborhood of the famous [[al-Azhar University|University of al-Azhar]], and lived from the proceeds of his literary production&lt;ref&gt;For Ibn al-Haytham's life and works, {{harv|Smith|2001|p=cxix}} recommends {{harv|Sabra|1989|pp=vol.2, xix-lxxiii}}&lt;/ref&gt;  until his death in c. 1040.&lt;ref name="Corbin 1993 149"/&gt; (A copy of [[Apollonius of Perga|Apollonius]]' ''Conics'', written in Ibn al-Haytham's own handwriting exists in [[Hagia Sophia|Aya Sofya]]: (MS Aya Sofya 2762, 307 fob., dated Safar 415 a.h.

== ''Book of Optics'' ==
{{main|Book of Optics}}

Alhazen's most famous work is his seven-volume treatise on [[optics]] ''Kitab al-Manazir'' (''Book of Optics''), written from 1011 to 1021.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Al-Khalili|2015}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Optics'' was [[Latin translations of the 12th century|translated into Latin]] by an unknown scholar at the end of the 12th century or the beginning of the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Crombie|1971|p=147, n. 2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{ efn| A. Mark Smith has determined that there were at least two translators, based on their facility with Arabic; the first, more experienced scholar began the translation at the beginning of Book One, and handed it off in the middle of Chapter Three of Book Three. {{harvnb|Smith|2001}} '''91''' Volume 1: Commentary and Latin text pp.xx-xxi. See also his 2006, 2008, 2010 translations.}} It was printed by [[Friedrich Risner]] in 1572, with the title ''Opticae thesaurus: Alhazeni Arabis libri septem, nuncprimum editi; Eiusdem liber De Crepusculis et nubium ascensionibus'' (English : Thesaurus of Optics: seven books of the Arab Alhazeni, first edition: concerning twilight and the advancement of clouds).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.mala.bc.ca/~mcneil/cit/citlcalhazen1.htm |title=Alhazen (965–1040): Library of Congress Citations |publisher=Malaspina Great Books |accessdate=23 January 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927190009/http://www.mala.bc.ca/~mcneil/cit/citlcalhazen1.htm |archivedate=27 September 2007 }}{{verify source|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Risner is also the author of the name variant "Alhazen"; before Risner he was known in the west as Alhacen.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2001|p=xxi}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This work enjoyed a great reputation during the [[Middle Ages]]. Works by Alhazen on geometric subjects were discovered in the [[Bibliothèque nationale]] in [[Paris]] in 1834 by E. A. Sedillot. In all, A. Mark Smith has accounted for 18 full or near-complete manuscripts, and five fragments, which are preserved in 14 locations, including one in the [[Bodleian Library]] at [[Oxford]], and one in the library of [[Bruges]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2001|p=xxii}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theory of optics ===

[[File:Thesaurus opticus Titelblatt.jpg|thumb|Front page of the ''Opticae Thesaurus'', which included the first printed Latin translation of Alhazen's ''Book of Optics''. The illustration incorporates many examples of optical phenomena including perspective effects, the rainbow, mirrors, and refraction.]]
Two major theories on vision prevailed in [[classical antiquity]]. The first theory, the [[Emission theory (vision)|emission theory]], was supported by such thinkers as [[Euclid]] and [[Ptolemy]], who believed that sight worked by the [[eye]] emitting [[Ray (optics)|rays]] of [[light]]. The second theory, the intromission theory supported by [[Aristotle]] and his followers, had physical forms entering the eye from an object. Previous Islamic writers (such as [[al-Kindi]]) had argued essentially on Euclidean, Galenist, or Aristotelian lines. The strongest influence on the ''Book of Optics'' was from Ptolemy's [[Ptolemy#Optics|''Optics'']], while the description of the anatomy and physiology of the eye was based on Galen's account.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2001|p=lxxix}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Alhazen's achievement was to come up with a theory that successfully combined parts of the mathematical ray arguments of Euclid, the medical tradition of [[Galen]], and the intromission theories of Aristotle. Alhazen's intromission theory followed al-Kindi (and broke with Aristotle) in asserting that "from each point of every colored body, illuminated by any light, issue light and color along every straight line that can be drawn from that point".&lt;ref name="{{harvnb|lindberg|1976|p=73}}."&gt;{{harvnb|Lindberg|1976|p=73}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This however left him with the problem of explaining how a coherent image was formed from many independent sources of radiation; in particular, every point of an object would send rays to every point on the eye. What Alhazen needed was for each point on an object to correspond to one point only on the eye.&lt;ref name="{{harvnb|lindberg|1976|p=73}}."/&gt;  He attempted to resolve this by asserting that the eye would only perceive perpendicular rays from the object—for any one point on the eye only saw the ray that reached it directly, without being refracted by any other part of the eye, would be perceived. He argued using a physical analogy that perpendicular rays were stronger than oblique rays; in the same way that a ball thrown directly at a board might break the board, whereas a ball thrown obliquely at the board would glance off, perpendicular rays were stronger than refracted rays, and it was only perpendicular rays which were perceived by the eye. As there was only one perpendicular ray that would enter the eye at any one point, and all these rays would converge on the centre of the eye in a cone, this allowed him to resolve the problem of each point on an object sending many rays to the eye; if only the perpendicular ray mattered, then he had a one-to-one correspondence and the confusion could be resolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Lindberg|1976|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later asserted (in book seven of the ''Optics'') that other rays would be refracted through the eye and perceived ''as if'' perpendicular.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Lindberg|1976|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His arguments regarding perpendicular rays do not clearly explain why ''only'' perpendicular rays were perceived; why would the weaker oblique rays not be perceived more weakly?&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lindberg|1976|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; His later argument that refracted rays would be perceived as if perpendicular does not seem persuasive.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lindberg|1976|pages=76–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite its weaknesses, no other theory of the time was so comprehensive, and it was enormously influential, particularly in Western Europe: Directly or indirectly, his ''De Aspectibus'' ([[Book of Optics]]) inspired much activity in optics between the 13th and 17th centuries.&lt;ref name="{{harvnb|lindberg|1976|p=86}}."&gt;{{harvnb|Lindberg|1976|p=86}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kepler]]'s later theory of the [[retina]]l image (which resolved the problem of the correspondence of points on an object and points in the eye) built directly on the conceptual framework of Alhazen.&lt;ref name="{{harvnb|lindberg|1976|p=86}}."/&gt;

Alhazen showed through experiment that light travels in straight lines, and carried out various experiments with [[lens (optics)|lenses]], [[mirror]]s, [[refraction]], and [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{harvnb|Al Deek|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His analyses of reflection and refraction considered the vertical and horizontal components of light rays separately.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heeffer|2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[camera obscura]] was known to the [[History of Science and Technology in China|ancient Chinese]], and was described by the [[Han Chinese]] [[polymath]]ic [[genius]] [[Shen Kuo]] in his scientific book ''[[Dream Pool Essays]]'', published in the year 1088 C.E.. Aristotle had discussed the basic principle behind it in his ''Problems'', however Alhazen's work also contained the first clear description, outside of [[History of Science and Technology in China|China]], of [[camera obscura]] in the areas of the [[middle east]], [[Europe]], [[Africa]] and [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kelley|Milone|Aveni|2005|p=83}}: {{quote|"The first clear description of the device appears in the ''Book of Optics'' of Alhazen."}}&lt;/ref&gt; and early analysis&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Wade|Finger|2001}}: {{quote|"The principles of the camera obscura first began to be correctly analysed in the eleventh century, when they were outlined by Ibn al-Haytham."}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the device.

Alhazen studied the process of sight, the structure of the eye, image formation in the eye, and the [[visual system]]. Ian P. Howard argued in a 1996 ''[[Perception (journal)|Perception]]'' article that Alhazen should be credited with many discoveries and theories previously attributed to Western Europeans writing centuries later. For example, he described what became in the 19th century [[Hering's law of equal innervation]]. He wrote a description of vertical [[horopter]]s 600 years before [[Aguilonius]] that is actually closer to the modern definition than Aguilonius's—and his work on [[binocular disparity]] was repeated by Panum in 1858.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Howard|1996}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Craig Aaen-Stockdale, while agreeing that Alhazen should be credited with many advances, has expressed some caution, especially when considering Alhazen in isolation from [[Ptolemy]], who Alhazen was extremely familiar with. Alhazen corrected a significant error of Ptolemy regarding binocular vision, but otherwise his account is very similar; Ptolemy also attempted to explain what is now called Hering's law.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Aaen-Stockdale|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, Alhazen built on and expanded the optics of Ptolemy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wade|1998|pages=240,316,334,367}}; {{harvnb|Howard|Wade|1996|pages=1195,1197,1200}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In a more detailed account of Ibn al-Haytham's contribution to the study of binocular vision based on Lejeune&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lejeune|1958}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and Sabra,&lt;ref name="{{harvnb|sabra|1989}}."&gt;{{harvnb|Sabra|1989}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Raynaud&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Raynaud|2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt; showed that the concepts of correspondence, homonymous and crossed diplopia were in place in Ibn al-Haytham's optics. But contrary to Howard, he explained why Ibn al-Haytham did not give the circular figure of the horopter and why, by reasoning experimentally, he was in fact closer to the discovery of Panum's fusional area than that of the Vieth-Müller circle. In this regard, Ibn al-Haytham's theory of binocular vision faced two main limits: the lack of recognition of the role of the retina, and obviously the lack of an experimental investigation of ocular tracts.

Alhazen's most original contribution was that after describing how he thought the eye was anatomically constructed, he went on to consider how this anatomy would behave functionally as an optical system.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Russell|1996|p=691}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His understanding of pinhole projection from his experiments appears to have influenced his consideration of image inversion in the eye,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Russell|1996|p=689}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which he sought to avoid.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lindberg|1976|pages= 80–85}}&lt;/ref&gt; He maintained that the rays that fell perpendicularly on the lens (or glacial humor as he called it) were further refracted outward as they left the glacial humor and the resulting image thus passed upright into the optic nerve at the back of the eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2004|pages=186, 192}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  He followed [[Galen]] in believing that the [[Lens (anatomy)|lens]] was the receptive organ of sight, although some of his work hints that he thought the [[retina]] was also involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wade|1998|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alhazen's synthesis of light and vision adhered to the Aristotelian scheme, exhaustively describing the process of vision in a logical, complete fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2001|p=437}}  [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3657357?seq=104&amp;Search=yes&amp;resultItemClick=true&amp;searchText=child&amp;searchText=does&amp;searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3FQuery%3Dchild%2Bdoes%26amp%3Bfilter%3Diid%253A10.2307%252Fi370516#page_scan_tab_contents ''De Aspectibus'' Book Two, 3.39 p.437, via JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

An aspect associated with Alhazen's optical research is related to systemic and methodological reliance on experimentation (''i'tibar'')(Arabic: إعتبار) and [[Scientific control|controlled testing]] in his scientific inquiries.  Moreover, his experimental directives rested on combining classical physics (''ilm tabi'i'') with mathematics (''ta'alim''; geometry in particular). This mathematical-physical approach to experimental science supported most of his propositions in ''Kitab al-Manazir'' (''The Optics''; ''De aspectibus'' or ''Perspectivae'')&lt;ref&gt;See, for example,[http://perspectiva.biblhertz.it/doc01.VII.html ''De aspectibus'' Book 7], for his experiments in refraction&lt;/ref&gt; and grounded his theories of vision, light and colour, as well as his research in catoptrics and [[dioptrics]] (the study of the reflection and refraction of light, respectively).&lt;ref name="{{harvs|nb|last=el-bizri|year=2005a|year2=2005b}}."&gt;{{harvs|nb|last=El-Bizri|year=2005a|year2=2005b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- [[Bradley Steffens]] in his book ''Ibn Al-Haytham: First Scientist'' has argued that Alhazen's approach to testing and experimentation made an important contribution to the scientific method. --&gt;

According to Matthias Schramm,&lt;ref name=thiele2005&gt;[https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82356023.pdf see Schramm's Habilitationsschrift, ''Ibn al-Haythams Weg zur Physik'' (Steiner, Wiesbaden, 1963)  as cited by Rüdiger Thiele (2005) ''Historia Mathematica'' '''32''', 271–274. "In Memoriam: Matthias Schramm, 1928–2005"]&lt;/ref&gt; Alhazen "was the first to make a systematic use of the method of varying the experimental conditions in a constant and uniform manner, in an experiment showing that the intensity of the light-spot formed by the projection of the [[moonlight]] through two small [[apertures]] onto a screen diminishes constantly as one of the apertures is gradually blocked up."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Toomer|1964|pp=463–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; G. J. Toomer expressed some skepticism regarding Schramm's view,&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{harvnb|Toomer|1964|p=465}}&lt;/ref&gt; arguing that caution is needed to avoid reading anachronistically particular passages in Alhazen's very large body of work, because at the time (1964), his ''Book of Optics'' had not yet been fully translated from Arabic.  While acknowledging Alhazen's importance in developing experimental techniques, Toomer argued that Alhazen should not be considered in isolation from other Islamic and ancient thinkers.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Toomer does concede that "Schramm sums up [Alhazen's] achievement in the development of scientific method."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Toomer|1964|p=464}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Toomer 1964 lists, as a precondition, what is needed for historians to investigate Schramm's claim (1963) that Ibn al-Haytham was the true founder of modern physics,&lt;ref name=thiele2005 /&gt; is translations of Ibn al-Haytham.&lt;ref name=toomer1964Review&gt;[[G.

Mark Smith recounts Alhazen's elaboration of Ptolemy's experiments in double vision, reflection, and refraction: Alhazen's ''Optics'' book influenced the Perspectivists in Europe, Roger Bacon, Witelo, and Peckham. ''The Optics'' was incorporated into Risner's 1572 printing of ''Opticae Thesaurus'', through which Kepler&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2015|p=329}}&lt;/ref&gt; finally resolved the contradictions inherent in [[Witelo]]'s explanation of the imaging chain, from external object to the retina of the eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2004|p=192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alhazen's problem ===
{{main|Alhazen's problem}}
[[File:Theorem of al-Haitham.JPG|thumb|The [[Circle#Theorems|theorem of Ibn Haytham]]]]
His work on [[catoptrics]] in Book V of the Book of Optics contains a discussion of what is now known as Alhazen's problem, first formulated by [[Ptolemy]] in 150 AD. It comprises drawing lines from two points in the [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] of a circle meeting at a point on the [[circumference]] and making equal angles with the [[Normal (geometry)|normal]] at that point. This is equivalent to finding the point on the edge of a circular [[billiard table]] at which a player must aim a cue ball at a given point to make it bounce off the table edge and hit another ball at a second given point. Thus, its main application in optics is to solve the problem, "Given a light source and a spherical mirror, find the point on the mirror where the light will be reflected to the eye of an observer." This leads to an [[Quartic equation|equation of the fourth degree]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|O'Connor|Robertson|1999}}, {{harvnb|Weisstein|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This eventually led Alhazen to derive a formula for the sum of [[fourth power]]s, where previously only the formulas for the sums of squares and cubes had been stated. His method can be readily generalized to find the formula for the sum of any integral powers, although he did not himself do this (perhaps because he only needed the fourth power to calculate the volume of the paraboloid he was interested in). He used his result on sums of integral powers to perform what would now be called an [[Integral|integration]], where the formulas for the sums of integral squares and fourth powers allowed him to calculate the volume of a [[paraboloid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Katz|1995|pp=165–9 &amp;amp; 173–4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Alhazen eventually solved the problem using [[conic section]]s and a geometric proof. His solution was extremely long and complicated and may not have been understood by mathematicians reading him in Latin translation. Later mathematicians used [[Descartes]]' analytical methods to analyse the problem,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1992}}.&lt;/ref&gt; with a new solution being found in 1997 by the Oxford mathematician [[Peter M. Neumann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Highfield|1997}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, [[Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories]] (MERL) researchers Amit Agrawal, Yuichi Taguchi and Srikumar Ramalingam solved the extension of Alhazen's problem to general rotationally symmetric quadric mirrors including hyperbolic, parabolic and elliptical mirrors.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Agrawal|Taguchi|Ramalingam|2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They showed that the mirror reflection point can be computed by solving an eighth degree equation in the most general case. If the camera (eye) is placed on the axis of the mirror, the degree of the equation reduces to six.&lt;ref name="{{harvnb|agrawal|taguchi|ramalingam|2010}}."&gt;{{harvnb|Agrawal|Taguchi|Ramalingam|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Alhazen's problem can also be extended to multiple refractions from a spherical ball. Given a light source and a spherical ball of certain refractive index, the closest point on the spherical ball where the light is refracted to the eye of the observer can be obtained by solving a tenth degree equation.&lt;ref name="{{harvnb|agrawal|taguchi|ramalingam|2010}}."/&gt;

He conducted experiments with [[projectile]]s and concluded that only the impact of [[perpendicular]] projectiles on surfaces was forceful enough to make them penetrate, whereas surfaces tended to deflect [[Oblique angle|oblique]] projectile strikes. For example, to explain refraction from a rare to a dense medium, he used the mechanical analogy of an iron ball thrown at a thin slate covering a wide hole in a metal sheet. A perpendicular throw breaks the slate and passes through, whereas an oblique one with equal force and from an equal distance does not.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Russell|1996|p=695}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He also used this result to explain how intense, direct light hurts the eye, using a mechanical analogy: Alhazen associated 'strong' lights with perpendicular rays and 'weak' lights with oblique ones. The obvious answer to the problem of multiple rays and the eye was in the choice of the perpendicular ray, since only one such ray from each point on the surface of the object could penetrate the eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Russell|1996|p=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sudanese psychologist Omar Khaleefa has argued that Alhazen should be considered the founder of [[experimental psychology]], for his pioneering work on the psychology of visual perception and [[optical illusion]]s.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{harvnb|Khaleefa|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khaleefa has also argued that Alhazen should also be considered the "founder of [[psychophysics]]", a sub-discipline and precursor to modern psychology.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; Although Alhazen made many subjective reports regarding vision, there is no evidence that he used quantitative psychophysical techniques and the claim has been rebuffed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Aaen-Stockdale|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alhazen offered an explanation of the [[Moon illusion]], an illusion that played an important role in the scientific tradition of medieval Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ross|Plug|2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Many authors repeated explanations that attempted to solve the problem of the Moon appearing larger near the horizon than it does when higher up in the sky. Alhazen argued against Ptolemy's refraction theory, and defined the problem in terms of perceived, rather than real, enlargement. He said that judging the distance of an object depends on there being an uninterrupted sequence of intervening bodies between the object and the observer. When the Moon is high in the sky there are no intervening objects, so the Moon appears close. The perceived size of an object of constant angular size varies with its perceived distance. Therefore, the Moon appears closer and smaller high in the sky, and further and larger on the horizon. Through works by [[Roger Bacon]], [[John Pecham]] and Witelo based on Alhazen's explanation, the Moon illusion gradually came to be accepted as a psychological phenomenon, with the refraction theory being rejected in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hershenson|1989|pp=9–10}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Alhazen is often credited with the perceived distance explanation, he was not the first author to offer it. [[Cleomedes]] ({{circa}} 2nd century) gave this account (in addition to refraction), and he credited it to [[Posidonius]] ({{circa}} 135-50 BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ross|2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Ptolemy may also have offered this explanation in his ''Optics'', but the text is obscure.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ross|Ross|1976}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Alhazen's writings were more widely available in the Middle Ages than those of these earlier authors, and that probably explains why Alhazen received the credit.

== Other works on physics ==

=== Optical treatises ===

Besides the ''Book of Optics'', Alhazen wrote several other treatises on the same subject, including his ''Risala fi l-Daw’'' (''Treatise on Light''). He investigated the properties of [[luminance]], the [[rainbow]], [[eclipse]]s, twilight, and [[moonlight]]. Experiments with mirrors and the refractive interfaces between air, water, and glass cubes, hemispheres, and quarter-spheres provided the foundation for his theories on [[catoptrics]].&lt;ref name="{{harvnb|el-bizri|2006}}."&gt;{{harvnb|El-Bizri|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Celestial physics ===
Alhazen discussed the [[physics]] of the celestial region in his ''Epitome of Astronomy'', arguing that Ptolemaic models must be understood in terms of physical objects rather than abstract hypotheses—in other words that it should be possible to create physical models where (for example) none of the celestial bodies would collide with each other. The suggestion of mechanical models for the Earth centred [[Ptolemaic model]] "greatly contributed to the eventual triumph of the Ptolemaic system among the Christians of the West". Alhazen's determination to root astronomy in the realm of physical objects was important, however, because it meant astronomical hypotheses "were accountable to the [[Physical law|laws of physics]]", and could be criticised and improved upon in those terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Duhem|1969|p=28}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

He also wrote ''Maqala fi daw al-qamar'' (''On the Light of the Moon'').

=== Mechanics ===

In his work, Alhazen discussed theories on the [[Motion (physics)|motion]] of a body.&lt;ref name="{{harvnb|el-bizri|2006}}."/&gt; In his ''Treatise on Place'', Alhazen disagreed with [[Aristotle]]'s view that nature abhors a void, and he used [[geometry]] in an attempt to demonstrate that place (''al-makan'') is the imagined three-dimensional void between the inner surfaces of a containing body.&lt;ref name="{{harvnb|el-bizri|2007}}."&gt;{{harvnb|El-Bizri|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Astronomical works ==

=== ''On the Configuration of the World'' ===

In his ''On the Configuration of the World'' Alhazen presented a detailed description of the physical structure of the earth:{{quote|The earth as a whole is a round sphere whose center is the center of the world. It is stationary in its [the world's] middle, fixed in it and not moving in any direction nor moving with any of the varieties of motion, but always at rest.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Langermann|1990}}, chap. 2, sect. 22, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The book is a non-technical explanation of Ptolemy's [[Almagest]], which was eventually translated into [[Hebrew]] and [[Latin]] in the 13th and 14th centuries and subsequently had an influence on astronomers such as [[Georg von Peuerbach]]&lt;ref name="{{harvnb|lorch|2008}}."&gt;{{harvnb|Lorch|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; during the European [[Middle Ages]] and [[Renaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Langermann|1990|pp=34–41}}; {{harvnb|Gondhalekar|2001|p=21}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Doubts Concerning Ptolemy'' ===

In his ''Al-Shukūk ‛alā Batlamyūs'', variously translated as ''Doubts Concerning Ptolemy'' or ''Aporias against Ptolemy'', published at some time between 1025 and 1028, Alhazen criticized [[Ptolemy]]'s ''Almagest'', ''Planetary Hypotheses'', and ''Optics'', pointing out various contradictions he found in these works, particularly in astronomy. Ptolemy's ''Almagest'' concerned mathematical theories regarding the motion of the planets, whereas the ''Hypotheses'' concerned what Ptolemy thought was the actual configuration of the planets. Ptolemy himself acknowledged that his theories and configurations did not always agree with each other, arguing that this was not a problem provided it did not result in noticeable error, but Alhazen was particularly scathing in his criticism of the inherent contradictions in Ptolemy's works.&lt;ref name="{{harvnb|sabra|1998}}."&gt;{{harvnb|Sabra|1998}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He considered that some of the mathematical devices Ptolemy introduced into astronomy, especially the [[equant]], failed to satisfy the physical requirement of uniform circular motion, and noted the absurdity of relating actual physical motions to imaginary mathematical points, lines and circles:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Langermann|1990|pp=8–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Ptolemy assumed an arrangement (''hay'a'') that cannot exist, and the fact that this arrangement produces in his imagination the motions that belong to the planets does not free him from the error he committed in his assumed arrangement, for the existing motions of the planets cannot be the result of an arrangement that is impossible to exist...  [F]or a man to imagine a circle in the heavens, and to imagine the planet moving in it does not bring about the planet's motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sabra|1978b|p=121, n. 13}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Having pointed out the problems, Alhazen appears to have intended to resolve the contradictions he pointed out in Ptolemy in a later work. Alhazen believed there was a "true configuration" of the planets that Ptolemy had failed to grasp. He intended to complete and repair Ptolemy's system, not to replace it completely.&lt;ref name="{{harvnb|sabra|1998}}."/&gt; In the ''Doubts Concerning Ptolemy'' Alhazen set out his views on the difficulty of attaining scientific knowledge and the need to question existing authorities and theories:

{{quote|Truth is sought for itself [but] the truths, [he warns] are immersed in uncertainties [and the scientific authorities (such as Ptolemy, whom he greatly respected) are] not immune from error...&lt;ref name="{{harvnb|sabra|1989}}."/&gt;}}

He held that the criticism of existing theories—which dominated this book—holds a special place in the growth of scientific knowledge.

=== ''Model of the Motions of Each of the Seven Planets'' ===

Alhazen's ''The Model of the Motions of Each of the Seven Planets'' was written {{circa}} 1038. Only one damaged manuscript has been found, with only the introduction and the first section, on the theory of planetary motion, surviving. (There was also a second section on astronomical calculation, and a third section, on astronomical instruments.) Following on from his ''Doubts on Ptolemy'', Alhazen described a new, geometry-based planetary model, describing the motions of the planets in terms of spherical geometry, infinitesimal geometry and trigonometry. He kept a geocentric universe and assumed that celestial motions are uniformly circular, which required the inclusion of [[epicycles]] to explain observed motion, but he managed to eliminate Ptolemy's [[equant]]. In general, his model didn't try to provide a causal explanation of the motions, but concentrated on providing a complete, geometric description that could explain observed motions without the contradictions inherent in Ptolemy's model.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rashed|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other astronomical works ===

Alhazen wrote a total of twenty-five astronomical works, some concerning technical issues such as ''Exact Determination of the Meridian'', a second group concerning accurate astronomical observation, a third group concerning various astronomical problems and questions such as the location of the [[Milky Way]]; Alhazen argued for a distant location, based on the fact that it does not move in relation to the fixed stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mohamed|2000|pp=49–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fourth group consists of ten works on astronomical theory, including the ''Doubts'' and ''Model of the Motions'' discussed above.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rashed|2007|pp=8–9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mathematical works ==
[[File:AlhazenSummation.png|thumb|150px|Alhazen's geometrically proven summation formula]]
In [[Islamic mathematics|mathematics]], Alhazen built on the mathematical works of [[Euclid]] and [[Thabit ibn Qurra]] and worked on "the beginnings of the link between [[algebra]] and [[geometry]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Faruqi|2006|pp=395–6}}:
{{quote|In seventeenth century Europe the problems formulated by Ibn al-Haytham (965–1041) became known as 'Alhazen's problem'. [...] Al-Haytham’s contributions to geometry and number theory went well beyond the Archimedean tradition. Al-Haytham also worked on analytical geometry and the beginnings of the link between algebra and geometry. Subsequently, this work led in pure mathematics to the harmonious fusion of algebra and geometry that was epitomised by Descartes in geometric analysis and by Newton in the calculus. Al-Haytham was a scientist who made major contributions to the fields of mathematics, physics and astronomy during the latter half of the tenth century.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He developed a formula for summing the first 100 natural numbers, using a geometric proof to prove the formula.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rottman|2000}}, Chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alhazen explored what is now known as the [[Euclidean geometry|Euclidean]] [[parallel postulate]], the fifth [[Axiom|postulate]] in [[Euclid's Elements|Euclid's ''Elements'']], using a [[Reductio ad absurdum|proof by contradiction]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eder|2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and in effect introducing the concept of motion into geometry.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Katz|1998|p=269}}: {{quote|In effect, this method characterised parallel lines as lines always equidistant from one another and also introduced the concept of motion into geometry.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He formulated the [[Lambert quadrilateral]], which Boris Abramovich Rozenfeld names the "Ibn al-Haytham–Lambert quadrilateral".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rozenfeld|1988|p=65}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In elementary geometry, Alhazen attempted to solve the problem of [[squaring the circle]] using the area of [[Lune (mathematics)|lune]]s (crescent shapes), but later gave up on the impossible task.&lt;ref name="{{harvnb|o'connor|robertson|1999}}."&gt;{{harvnb|O'Connor|Robertson|1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The two lunes formed from a [[right triangle]] by erecting a semicircle on each of the triangle's sides, inward for the hypotenuse and outward for the other two sides, are known as the [[Lune of Hippocrates|lunes of Alhazen]]; they have the same total area as the triangle itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Alsina|Nelsen|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Number theory ===

Alhazen's contributions to [[number theory]] include his work on [[perfect number]]s. In his ''Analysis and Synthesis'', he may have been the first to state that every even perfect number is of the form 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sup&gt;(2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1) where 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 is [[Prime number|prime]], but he was not able to prove this result; [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] later proved it in the 18th century.&lt;ref name="{{harvnb|o'connor|robertson|1999}}."/&gt;

Alhazen solved problems involving [[congruence relation|congruences]] using what is now called [[Wilson's theorem]]. In his ''Opuscula'', Alhazen considers the solution of a system of congruences, and gives two general methods of solution. His first method, the canonical method, involved Wilson's theorem, while his second method involved a version of the [[Chinese remainder theorem]].&lt;ref name="{{harvnb|o'connor|robertson|1999}}."/&gt;

=== Calculus ===
Alhazen discovered the sum formula for the fourth power, using a method that could be generally used to determine the sum for any integral power. He used this to find the volume of a [[paraboloid]]. He could find the integral formula for any polynomial without having developed a general formula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/2691411 |author=Katz, Victor J. |title=Ideas of Calculus in Islam and India |jstor=2691411 |journal=Mathematics Magazine |volume=68 |issue=3 |pages=163–174 |year=1995 }} [165–9, 173–4]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other works ==

=== ''Influence of Melodies on the Souls of Animals'' ===

Alhazen also wrote a ''Treatise on the Influence of Melodies on the Souls of Animals'', although no copies have survived. It appears to have been concerned with the question of whether animals could react to music, for example whether a camel would increase or decrease its pace.

=== Engineering ===

In [[Inventions in the Islamic world|engineering]], one account of his career as a [[civil engineer]] has him summoned to Egypt by the Fatimid [[Caliph]], [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah]], to regulate the [[flooding]] of the [[Nile]] River. He carried out a detailed scientific study of the annual [[inundation]] of the Nile River, and he drew plans for building a [[dam]], at the site of the modern-day [[Aswan Dam]]. His field work, however, later made him aware of the impracticality of this scheme, and he soon [[feigned madness]] so he could avoid punishment from the Caliph.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Plott|2000}}, Pt. II, p. 459.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Philosophy ===

In his ''Treatise on Place'', Alhazen disagreed with [[Aristotle]]'s view that nature abhors a [[Vacuum|void]], and he used [[geometry]] in an attempt to demonstrate that place (''al-makan'') is the imagined three-dimensional void between the inner surfaces of a containing body.&lt;ref name="{{harvnb|el-bizri|2007}}."/&gt; [[Abd al-Latif al-Baghdadi (medieval writer)|Abd-el-latif]], a supporter of Aristotle's philosophical view of place, later criticized the work in ''Fi al-Radd ‘ala Ibn al-Haytham fi al-makan'' (''A refutation of Ibn al-Haytham’s place'') for its geometrization of place.&lt;ref name="{{harvnb|el-bizri|2007}}."/&gt;

Alhazen also discussed [[Depth perception|space perception]] and its [[Epistemology|epistemological]] implications in his ''[[Book of Optics]]''. In "tying the visual perception of space to prior bodily experience, Alhazen unequivocally rejected the intuitiveness of spatial perception and, therefore, the autonomy of vision. Without tangible notions of distance and size for
correlation, sight can tell us next to nothing about such things."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2005|pp=219–40}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theology ===
Alhazen was a Muslim; it is not certain to which school of Islam he belonged. As a Sunni, he may have been either a follower of the [[Ash'ari]] school,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sardar|1998}}, {{harvnb|Bettany|1995|p=251}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or a follower of the [[Mu'tazili]] school.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hodgson|2006|p=53}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Sabra (1978) even suggested he might have been an adherent of [[Shia Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Sabra|1978a|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=June 2009}}

Alhazen wrote a work on Islamic theology in which he discussed prophethood and developed a system of philosophical criteria to discern its false claimants in his time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Plott|2000}}, Pt. II, p. 464&lt;/ref&gt; 
He also wrote a treatise entitled ''Finding the Direction of Qibla by Calculation'' in which he discussed finding the [[Qibla]], where prayers ([[salat]]) are directed towards, mathematically.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Topdemir|2007b|pp=8&amp;ndash;9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are occasional references to theology or religious sentiment in his technical works, e.g. 
in  ''Doubts Concerning Ptolemy'':
{{quote|Truth is sought for its own sake ... Finding the truth is difficult, and the road to it is rough. For the truths are plunged in obscurity. ... God, however, has not preserved the scientist from error and has not safeguarded science from shortcomings and faults. If this had been the case, scientists would not have disagreed upon any point of science...&lt;ref name=Sambursky1974&gt;Translated by S. Pines, as quoted in {{harvnb|Sambursky|1974|p=139}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
In ''The Winding Motion'':
{{quote|From the statements made by the noble Shaykh, it is clear that he believes in Ptolemy's words in everything he says, without relying on a demonstration or calling on a proof, but by pure imitation (''taqlid''); that is how experts in the prophetic tradition have faith in Prophets, may the blessing of God be upon them. But it is not the way that mathematicians have faith in specialists in the demonstrative sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rashed|2007|p=11}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Regarding the relation of objective truth and God:
{{quote|I constantly sought knowledge and truth, and it became my belief that for gaining access to the effulgence and closeness to God, there is no better way than that of searching for truth and knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Plott|2000}}, Pt. II, p. 465&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Legacy ==
[[File:Book of Optics Cover Page.jpg|175px|thumb|Cover page of the Latin translation of ''[[Book of Optics|Kitāb al-Manāẓir]]'']][[File:10IQDfront.jpg|thumb|Iraqi 10 [[Iraqi dinar|dinar]] note]][[File:10000IQDfront.jpg|thumb|Iraqi 10.000 dinar note]]
Alhazen made significant contributions to optics, number theory, geometry, astronomy and natural philosophy. Alhazen's work on optics is credited with contributing a new emphasis on experiment.

His main work, ''[[Book of Optics|Kitab al-Manazir]]'' (''Book of Optics''), was known in the [[Muslim world]] mainly, but not exclusively, through the thirteenth-century commentary by [[Kamāl al-Dīn al-Fārisī]], the ''Tanqīḥ ''al-Manāẓir'' li-dhawī l-abṣār wa l-baṣā'ir''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sabra|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[al-Andalus]], it was used by the eleventh-century prince of the [[Banu Hud|Banu Hud dynasty]] of [[Zaragoza|Zaragossa]] and author of an important mathematical text, [[al-Mu'taman ibn Hud|al-Mu'taman ibn Hūd]]. A Latin translation of the ''Kitab al-Manazir'' was made probably in the late twelfth or early thirteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sabra|2007|pages=122, 128–129}}. {{harvtxt|Grant|1974|p=[{{google books|fAPN_3w4hAUC|plainurl=yes|page=392}} 392]}} notes the ''Book of Optics'' has also been denoted as ''Opticae Thesaurus Alhazen Arabis'', as ''De Aspectibus'', and also as ''Perspectiva''&lt;/ref&gt;  This translation was read by and greatly influenced a number of scholars in Christian Europe including: [[Roger Bacon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lindberg|1996|p=11}}, passim.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Grosseteste]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Authier|2013|p=23}}: "Alhazen's works in turn inspired many scientists of the Middle Ages, such as the English bishop, Robert Grosseteste (ca 1175–1253), and the English Franciscan, Roger Bacon (ca 1214–1294), Erazmus Ciolek Witelo, or Witelon (ca 1230* 1280), a Silesian-born Polish friar, philosopher and scholar, published in ca 1270 a treatise on optics, Perspectiva, largely based on Alhazen's works."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Witelo]], [[Giambattista della Porta]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Magill|Aves|1998|p=66}}: "Roger Bacon, John Peckham, and Giambattista della Porta are only some of the many thinkers who were influenced by Alhazen's work."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leonardo Da Vinci]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Zewail|Thomas|2010|p=5}}: "The Latin translation of Alhazen's work influenced scientists and philosophers such as (Roger) Bacon and da Vinci, and formed the foundation for the work by mathematicians like Kepler, Descartes and Huygens..."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Galileo Galilei]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|El-Bizri|2010|p=12}}: "This [Latin] version of Ibn al-Haytham's Optics, which became available in print, was read and consulted by scientists and philosophers of the caliber of Kepler, Galileo, Descartes, and Huygens as discussed by [[Nader El-Bizri]]."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christiaan Huygens]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Magill|Aves|1998|p=66}}: "Sabra discusses in detail the impact of Alhazen's ideas on the optical discoveries of such men as Descartes and Christiaan Huygens; see also {{harvnb|El-Bizri|2005a}}."&lt;/ref&gt; [[René Descartes]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|El-Bizri|2010|p=12}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Johannes Kepler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Magill|Aves|1998|p=66}}: "Even Kepler, however, used some of Alhazen's ideas, for example, the one-to-one correspondence between points on the object and points in the eye. It would not be going too far to say that Alhazen's optical theories defined the scope and goals of the field from his day to ours."&lt;/ref&gt;  His research in [[catoptrics]] (the study of optical systems using mirrors) centred on spherical and [[Parabola|parabolic]] mirrors and [[spherical aberration]]. He made the observation that the ratio between the [[angle of incidence (optics)|angle of incidence]] and [[refraction]] does not remain constant, and investigated the [[Magnification|magnifying]] power of a [[Lens (optics)|lens]]. His work on catoptrics also contains the problem known as "[[Alhazen's problem]]".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Meanwhile in the Islamic world, Alhazen's work influenced [[Averroes]]' writings on optics,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Topdemir|2007a|p=77}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and his legacy was further advanced through the 'reforming' of his ''Optics'' by Persian scientist [[Kamal al-Din al-Farisi]] (died ca. 1320) in the latter's ''Kitab Tanqih al-Manazir'' (''The Revision of'' [Ibn al-Haytham's] ''Optics'').&lt;ref name="{{harvs|nb|last=el-bizri|year=2005a|year2=2005b}}."/&gt; Alhazen wrote as many as 200 books, although only 55 have survived. Some of his treatises on optics survived only through Latin translation. During the Middle Ages his books on [[cosmology]] were translated into Latin, [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and other languages.

The [[impact crater]] [[Alhazen (crater)|Alhazen]] on the Moon is named in his honour,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chong|Lim|Ang|2002}} Appendix 3, [{{google books|id=vIcFxgAs-C8C|plainurl=yes|page=129}} p. 129].&lt;/ref&gt; as was the [[asteroid]] [[59239 Alhazen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|NASA|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In honour of Alhazen, the [[Aga Khan University]] (Pakistan) named its Ophthalmology endowed chair as "The Ibn-e-Haitham Associate Professor and Chief of Ophthalmology".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aku.edu/res-office/pdfs/AKU_Research_Publications_1995–1998.pdf AKU Research Publications 1995-98] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150104215931/http://www.aku.edu/res-office/pdfs/AKU_Research_Publications_1995 |date=4 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alhazen, by the name Ibn al-Haytham, is featured on the obverse of the Iraqi 10,000-[[dinar]] banknote issued in 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Murphy|2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and on 10-dinar notes from 1982.

The 2015 [[International Year of Light]] celebrated the 1000th anniversary of the works on optics by Ibn Al-Haytham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ibn Al-Haytham and the Legacy of Arabic Optics|publisher=2015 INTERNATIONAL YEAR OF LIGHT|url=http://www.light2015.org/Home/ScienceStories/1000-Years-of-Arabic-Optics.html|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Commemorations ==
In 2014, the "[[Hiding in the Light]]" episode of ''[[Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey]]'', presented by [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]], focused on the accomplishments of Ibn al-Haytham. He was voiced by [[Alfred Molina]] in the episode.

Over forty years previously, [[Jacob Bronowski]] presented Alhazen's work in a similar television documentary (and the corresponding book), ''[[The Ascent of Man]]''. In episode 5 (''The Music of the Spheres''), Bronowski remarked that in his view, Alhazen was "the one really original scientific mind that Arab culture produced", whose theory of optics was not improved on till the time of Newton and Leibniz.

H. J. J. Winter, a British historian of science, summing up the importance of Ibn al-Haytham in the history of [[physics]] wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;After the death of Archimedes no really great physicist appeared until Ibn al-Haytham. If, therefore, we confine our interest only to the history of physics, there is a long period of over twelve hundred years during which the Golden Age of Greece gave way to the era of Muslim Scholasticism, and the experimental spirit of the noblest physicist of Antiquity lived again in the Arab Scholar from Basra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Winter |first1=H. J. J. |title=THE OPTICAL RESEARCHES OF IBN AL-HAITHAM |journal=Centaurus |date=September 1953 |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=190–210 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0498.1953.tb00529.x |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1600-0498.1953.tb00529.x |language=en |issn=0008-8994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[UNESCO]] declared 2015 the [[International Year of Light]] and its Director-General Irina Bokova dubbed Ibn al-Haytham 'the father of optics'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/fileadmin/MULTIMEDIA/HQ/SC/pdf/Programme-Opening_IYL2015.pdf 2015, International Year of Light]&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst others, this was to celebrate Ibn Al-Haytham's achievements in optics, mathematics and astronomy. An international campaign, created by the [[1001 Inventions]] organisation, titled ''1001 Inventions and the World of Ibn Al-Haytham'' featuring a series of interactive exhibits, workshops and live shows about his work, partnering with science centers, science festivals, museums, and educational institutions, as well as digital and social media platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/media-services/single-view/news/1000_years_of_arabic_optics_to_be_a_focus_of_the_international_year_of_light_in_2015 |title=1000 Years of Arabic Optics to be a Focus of the International Year of Light in 2015 |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=27 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign also produced and released the short educational film [[1001 Inventions and the World of Ibn Al-Haytham]].

== Criticism ==
===Refraction===
{{harvtxt|Smith|2010}} has noted that Alhazen's treatment of refraction describes an experimental setup without publication of data.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith| 2010}}  para.[3.33], p.259, footnote67. Note 67 is on p.361. [3.33] is the summary of how to measure the sizes of the angle of refraction for air to water, air to glass, glass to air, glass to water, for plane, concave, and convex surfaces&lt;/ref&gt; Ptolemy published his experimental results for refraction, in contrast.

== List of works ==

According to medieval biographers, Alhazen wrote more than 200 works on a wide range of subjects, of which at least 96 of his scientific works are known. Most of his works are now lost, but more than 50 of them have survived to some extent. Nearly half of his surviving works are on mathematics, 23 of them are on astronomy, and 14 of them are on optics, with a few on other subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rashed|2002a|p=773}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Not all his surviving works have yet been studied, but some of the ones that have are given below.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rashed|2007|pp=8–9}}; {{harvnb|Topdemir|2007b}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Latin]] phrase that translates literally to "on site"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dsitus2 Lewis &amp; Short Latin Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; or "in position".&lt;ref&gt;Collins Latin Dictionary &amp; Grammar&lt;/ref&gt; It means "locally", "on site", "on the premises" or "in place" to describe an event where it takes place, and is used in many different contexts. For example, in fields such as [[physics]], [[chemistry]], or [[biology]], ''in situ'' may describe the way a measurement is taken, that is, in the same place the phenomenon is occurring without isolating it from other systems or altering the original conditions of the test.

== Aerospace ==
In the [[aerospace industry]], equipment on-board aircraft must be tested ''in situ'', or in place, to confirm everything functions properly as a system. Individually, each piece may work but interference from nearby equipment may create unanticipated problems. Special test equipment is available for this ''in situ'' testing.

== Archaeology ==
[[File:Hohokam Arrowhead Sahuarita Arizona 2014.jpg|thumb|Ancient [[Hohokam]] arrowhead ''in situ''.]]

In [[archaeology]], ''in situ'' refers to an artifact that has not been moved from its original place of deposition. In other words, it is stationary, meaning "still." An artifact being ''in situ'' is critical to the interpretation of that artifact and, consequently, of the culture which formed it. Once an artifact's 'find-site' has been recorded, the artifact can then be moved for conservation, further interpretation and display. An artifact that is not discovered ''in situ'' is considered out of context and as not providing an accurate picture of the associated culture. However, the out of context artifact can provide scientists with an example of types and locations of ''in situ'' artifacts yet to be discovered. When excavating a burial site or surface deposit "in situ" refers to cataloging, recording, mapping, photographing human remains in the position they are discovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The label ''in situ'' indicates only that the object has not been "newly" moved. Thus, an archaeological ''in situ'' find may be an object that was historically looted from another place, an item of "booty" of a past war, a traded item, or otherwise of foreign origin. Consequently, the ''in situ'' find site may still not reveal its [[provenance]], but with further detective work may help uncover links that otherwise would remain unknown. It is also possible for archaeological layers to be reworked on purpose or by accident (by humans, natural forces or animals). For example, in a [[Tell (archaeology)|Tell]] mound, where layers are not typically uniform or horizontal, or in land cleared or tilled for farming.

The term ''in situ'' is often used to describe ancient sculpture that was carved in place such as the [[Great Sphinx of Giza|Sphinx]] or [[Petra]]. This distinguishes it from statues that were carved and moved like the [[Colossi of Memnon]], which was moved in ancient times.

== Art ==
In art, ''in situ'' refers to a work of art made specifically for a host site, or that a work of art takes into account the site in which it is installed or exhibited. For a more detailed account see: [[Site-specific art]]. The term can also refer to a work of art created at the site where it is to be displayed, rather than one created in the artist's studio and then installed elsewhere (''e.g.,'' a sculpture carved ''in situ'').  In [[architectural sculpture]] the term is frequently employed to describe sculpture that is carved on a building, frequently from scaffolds, after the building has been erected.&lt;ref name="FriedlandSobocinski2015"&gt;{{cite book

A fraction of the [[Globular cluster|globular star clusters]] in [[Milky Way|our galaxy]], as well as those in other massive galaxies, might have formed ''in situ''. The rest might have been accreted from now defunct dwarf galaxies.

In astronomy, ''in situ'' also refers to ''in situ'' [[Nebular hypothesis|planet formation]], in which planets are hypothesized to have been formed in the orbit that they are currently observed to be in rather than migrating from a different orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

== Biology and biomedical engineering ==
[[File:Natica hebraea.jpg|thumb|Live [[sea snail]], species ''[[Nataea]]'', photographed ''in situ'']]

In [[biology]] and [[biomedical engineering]], ''in situ'' means to examine the phenomenon exactly in place where it occurs (i.e., without moving it to some special medium).

In the case of observations or photographs of living animals, it means that the organism was observed (and photographed) in the wild, exactly as it was found and exactly where it was found. This means it was not taken out of the area. The organism had not been moved to another (perhaps more convenient) location such as an aquarium.

This phrase ''in situ'' when used in laboratory science such as cell science can mean something intermediate between ''[[in vivo]]'' and ''[[in vitro]]''. For example, examining a [[w:cell (biology)|cell]] within a whole [[organ (anatomy)|organ]] intact and under [[perfusion]] may be ''in situ'' investigation. This would not be ''in vivo'' as the donor is sacrificed by experimentation, but it would not be the same as working with the cell alone (a common scenario for ''in vitro'' experiments).

''In vitro'' was among the first attempts to qualitatively and quantitatively analyze natural occurrences in the lab. Eventually, the limitation of ''in vitro'' experimentation was that they were not conducted in natural environments. To compensate for this problem, ''in vivo'' experimentation allowed testing to occur in the original organism or environment. To bridge the dichotomy of benefits associated with both methodologies, ''in situ'' experimentation allowed the controlled aspects of ''in vitro'' to become coalesced with the natural environmental compositions of ''in vivo'' experimentation.

In conservation of [[Germplasm|genetic resources]], "[[in situ conservation|''in situ'' conservation]]" (also "on-site [[Conservation movement|conservation]]") is the process of protecting an [[endangered species|endangered]] [[plant]] or [[animal]] [[species]] in its natural [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]], as opposed to [[Ex situ conservation|''ex situ'' conservation]] (also "off-site conservation").

== Chemistry and chemical engineering ==
In chemistry, ''in situ'' typically means "in the reaction mixture."

There are numerous situations in which chemical intermediates are synthesized ''in situ'' in various processes. This may be done because the species is unstable, and cannot be isolated, or simply out of convenience. Examples of the former include the [[Corey-Chaykovsky reagent]] and [[adrenochrome]].

In biomedical engineering, protein nanogels made by the in situ polymerization method provide a versatile platform for storage and release of therapeutic proteins. It has tremendous applications for cancer treatment, vaccination, diagnosis, regenerative medicine, and therapies for loss-of-function genetic diseases.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In chemical engineering, ''in situ'' often refers to industrial plant "operations or procedures that are performed in place". For example, aged catalysts in industrial reactors may be regenerated in place (''in situ'') without being removed from the reactors.

== Civil engineering ==
In [[architecture]] and [[building]], ''in situ'' refers to construction which is carried out at the building site using raw materials. Compare that with ''prefabricated'' construction, in which building components are made in a factory and then transported to the building site for assembly. For example, [[concrete slab]]s may be ''in situ'' (also "cast-in-place") or ''prefabricated''.

'''''In situ''''' techniques are often more labour-intensive, and take longer, but the materials are cheaper, and the work is versatile and adaptable. ''Prefabricated'' techniques are usually much quicker, therefore saving money on labour costs, but factory-made parts can be expensive. They are also inflexible, and must often be designed on a grid, with all details fully calculated in advance. Finished units may require special handling due to excessive dimensions.

The phrase may also refer to those assets which are present at or near a project site. In this case, it is used to designate the state of an unmodified sample taken from a given stockpile.

Site construction usually involves grading the existing soil surface so that material is "cut" out of one area and "filled" in another area creating a flat pad on an existing slope.  The term "in situ" distinguishes soil still in its existing condition from soil modified (filled) during construction.  The differences in the soil properties for supporting building loads, accepting underground utilities, and infiltrating water persist indefinitely.

== Computer science ==
{{citation needed span|text=In [[computer science]] an ''in situ'' operation is one that occurs without interrupting the normal state of a system|date=June 2015}}. For example, a file backup may be restored over a running system, without needing to take the system down to perform the restore. In the context of a database, a restore would allow the database system to continue to be available to users while a restore happened. An ''in situ'' upgrade would allow an [[operating system]], [[firmware]] or [[computer program|application]] to be upgraded while the system was still running, perhaps without the need to reboot it, depending on the sophistication of the system.

Another use of the term in-situ that appears in Computer Science focuses primarily on the use of technology and user interfaces to provide continuous access to situationally relevant information in various locations and contexts&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal | last1= Ens|first1=Barrett |last2=Irani |first2=Pourang |date=March 2017 |title= Data representations for in-situ exploration of health and fitness data |url= https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7436646 |journal= IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications|volume= 37|issue=2 |pages=66-79 |doi=10.1109/MCG.2016.38 |access-date=2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1= Willett  |first1= Wesley  |last2=Jansen |first2=Yvonne | last3=Dragicevic |first3=Pierre |date=August 2016 |title= Embedded Data Representations |url= https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.uml.idm.oclc.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=7539328|journal= IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS|volume= 23|issue=1 |pages=461-470 |doi= 10.1109/TVCG.2016.2598608 |access-date=2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

{{citation needed span|text=An [[algorithm]] is said to be an [[in-place algorithm|''in situ'' algorithm, or in-place algorithm]], if the extra amount of memory required to execute the algorithm is [[O(1)]]|date=June 2015}}, that is, does not exceed a constant no matter how large the input ---except for space for recursive calls on the "call stack". Typically such an algorithm operates on [[object (computer science)|data objects]] directly in place rather than making copies of them. 

For example, [[heapsort]] is an ''in situ'' sorting algorithm, which sorts the elements of an array in place. [[Quicksort]] is an ''in situ'' sorting algorithm, but in the worst case it requires linear space on the call stack (this can be reduced to log space). Merge sort is generally not written as an ''in situ'' algorithm. 

In designing [[user interface]]s, {{citation needed span|text=the term ''in situ'' means that a particular user action can be performed without going to another window|date=June 2015}}, for example, if a word processor displays an image and allows the image to be edited without launching a separate image editor, this is called ''in situ editing.''

AJAX partial page data updates is another example of ''in situ'' in a Web UI/UX context. ''Web 2.0'' included AJAX and the concept of asynchronous requests to servers to replace a portion of a web page with new data, without reloading
the entire page, as the early HTML model dictated. Arguably, ''all'' asynchronous data transfers or ''any'' background task is ''in situ'' as the normal state is normally unaware of background tasks, usually notified on completion
by a callback mechanism.

In Big Data space, in situ data would mean bringing the computation to where data is located, rather than the other way&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.flashmemorysummit.com/English/Collaterals/Proceedings/2014/20140806_202E_Alves.pdf|title=In-Situ Processing Presentation|last=Alves|first=Vladimir|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; like in traditional RDBMS systems where data is moved to computational space.

== Design and advertising ==
In design and advertising the term typically means the superimposing of theoretical design elements onto photographs of real world locations. This is a pre-visualization tool to aid in illustrating a proof of concept.

== Earth and atmospheric sciences ==
In [[physical geography]] and the [[Earth science]]s, ''in situ'' typically describes natural material or processes prior to transport. For example, ''in situ'' is used in relation to the distinction between [[weathering]] and [[erosion]], the difference being that erosion requires a transport medium (such as [[Aeolian processes|wind]], [[glacier|ice]], or [[water]]), whereas weathering occurs ''in situ''. [[geochemistry|Geochemical]] processes are also often described as occurring to material ''in situ''.

In the [[atmospheric sciences]], ''in situ'' refers to obtained through direct contact with the respective subject, such as a [[radiosonde]] measuring a parcel of air or an [[anemometer]] measuring wind, as opposed to [[remote sensing]] such as weather [[Weather radar|radar]] or [[Weather satellite|satellites]].

== Economics ==
In economics, ''in situ'' is used when referring to the ''in place'' storage of a product, usually a natural resource. More generally, it refers to any situation where there is no out-of-pocket cost to store the product so that the only storage cost is the opportunity cost of waiting longer to get your money when the product is eventually sold. Examples of ''in situ'' storage would be oil and gas wells, all types of mineral and gem mines, stone quarries, timber that has reached an age where it could be harvested, and agricultural products that do not need a physical storage facility such as hay.

== Electrochemistry ==
In [[electrochemistry]], the phrase in situ refers to performing electrochemical experiments under operating conditions of the electrochemical cell, i.e., under potential control. This is opposed to doing ex situ experiments that are performed under the absence of potential control. Potential control preserves the electrochemical environment essential to maintain the double layer structure intact and the electron transfer reactions occurring at that particular potential in the electrode/electrolyte interphasial region.

== Environmental remediation ==
''In situ'' can refer to where a clean up or [[Environmental remediation|remediation]] of a [[polluted]] site is performed using and simulating the natural processes in the [[soil]], contrary to ''[[ex situ]]'' where contaminated soil is excavated and cleaned elsewhere, off site.

== Experimental physics ==
In [[experimental physics]] ''in situ'' typically refers to a method of data collection or manipulation of a sample without exposure to an external environment. For example, the Si(111) 7x7 surface reconstruction is visible using a [[scanning tunneling microscope]] when it is prepared and analyzed ''in situ''.

== Experimental psychology ==
In psychology [[experiment]]s, ''in situ'' typically refers to those experiments done in a field setting as opposed to a laboratory setting.

== Gastronomy ==
In [[gastronomy]], "in situ"&lt;!-- or "in situs" --&gt; refers to the art of cooking with the different resources that are available at the site of the event. Here a person is not going to the restaurant, but the restaurant comes to the person's home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Law ==
In [[legal]] contexts, ''in situ'' is often used for its literal meaning. For example, in [[Hong Kong]], "''in situ'' land exchange" involves the government exchanging the original or expired [[Leasehold estate|lease]] of a piece of land with a new [[Land grant|grant]] or re-grant with the same piece of land or a portion of that.

In the field of recognition of governments under public international law the term ''in situ'' is used to distinguish between an [[Government in exile|exiled government]] and a government with effective control over the territory, i.e. the government ''in situ''.

== Linguistics ==
In [[linguistics]], specifically [[syntax]], an element may be said to be ''in situ'' if it is pronounced in the position where it is interpreted. For example, [[question]]s in languages such as [[Chinese language|Chinese]] have ''in situ'' wh-elements, with structures comparable to "John bought what?" with ''what'' in the same position in the sentence as the grammatical object would be in its affirmative counterpart (for example, "John bought bread"). An example of an [[English language|English]] wh-element that is not ''in situ'' (see [[wh-movement]]): "What did John buy?"

== Literature ==
In [[literature]] ''in situ'' is used to describe a condition. The [[Rosetta Stone]], for example, was originally erected in a courtyard, for public viewing. Most pictures of the famous stone are not ''in situ'' pictures of it erected, as it would have been originally. The stone was uncovered as part of building material, within a wall. Its '''in situ''' condition today is that it is erected, vertically, on public display at the [[British Museum]] in London, England.

== Medicine ==
[[File:In situ carcinoma.jpg|thumb|In addition to benign tumors, there are in situ tumors and invasive tumors. In situ tumors do not invade the basement membrane, whereas invasive tumors do invade the basement membrane." Diagram of an in [[Carcinoma in situ|situ carcinoma]]]]

In [[oncology]]: for a [[carcinoma]], ''[[Carcinoma in situ|in situ]]'' means that [[malignant]] cells are present as a tumor but have not metastasized, or invaded, beyond the basement membrane of where the tumor was discovered. This can happen anywhere in the body, such as the skin, breast tissue, or lung. This type of tumor can often, depending on where it is located, be removed by [[surgery]].

In [[anatomy]]: ''in situ'' refers to viewing structures as they appear in normal healthy bodies. For example, one can open up a [[cadaver]]'s abdominal cavity and view the liver ''in situ'' or one can look at an isolated liver that has been removed from the cadaver's body.

In [[nursing]], "in situ" describes any devices or appliances on the patient's body that remain in their desired and optimal position.

In [[medical simulation]], "in situ" refers to the practice of clinical professionals using high fidelity patient simulators to train for clinical practice in patient care environments, such as wards, operating rooms, and other settings, rather than in dedicated simulation training facilities.

In biomedical, protein nanogels made by the in situ polymerization method provide a versatile platform for storage and release of therapeutic proteins. It has tremendous applications for cancer treatment, vaccination, diagnosis, regenerative medicine, and therapies for loss-of-function genetic diseases.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

== Mining ==
''In situ leaching'' or ''in situ recovery'' refers to the mining technique of injecting water underground to dissolve ore and bringing the uranium-impregnated water to the surface for extraction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf27.html In Situ Leach (ISL) Mining of Uranium]. world-nuclear.org&lt;/ref&gt;

== Petroleum production ==
''In situ'' refers to recovery techniques which apply heat or solvents to [[heavy crude oil]] or [[bitumen]] reservoirs beneath the earth's crust. There are several varieties of ''in situ'' techniques, but the ones which work best in the [[oil sands]] use heat (steam).

The most common type of ''in situ'' petroleum production is referred to as SAGD ([[steam-assisted gravity drainage]]) this is becoming very popular in the Alberta Oil Sands.

== RF transmission ==
In [[radio frequency]] (RF) transmission systems, ''in situ'' is often used to describe the location of various components while the system is in its standard transmission mode, rather than operation in a test mode. For example, if an ''in situ'' [[wattmeter]] is used in a commercial broadcast transmission system, the [[wattmeter]] can accurately measure power while the station is "on air".

== Space-related ==
Future space exploration or [[terraforming]] may rely on [[In-situ resource utilization|obtaining supplies ''in situ'']], such as previous plans to power the [[Orion (Constellation program)|Orion space vehicle]] with fuel minable on the moon. The [[Mars Direct]] mission concept is based primarily on the ''in situ'' fuel production using [[Sabatier reaction]].

In the [[space sciences]], ''in situ'' refers to measurements of the particle and field environment that the satellite is embedded in, such as the detection of energetic particles in the [[solar wind]], or magnetic field measurements from a [[magnetometer]].

'''''In the Name of Science''''' is a book written by [[Harold L. Nieburg]] in 1966 concerning the [[political]] uses of [[science]]. It focuses on [[United States|American]] [[Defense (military)|defense]] spending on science and the U.S. [[military-industrial complex]], and was one of the first books to discuss this issue at length. 

A summary appears in the [[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]] 22 (March 1966), pp.&amp;nbsp;20–24, as ''R and D in the Contract State: Throwing Away the Yardstick'' in a review by [[Bernard L. Spinrad]].

[[File:Journal NPCA title page 1800.png|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Title page of 1799-1800 volume&lt;/center&gt;]]

The '''''A Journal of Natural Philosophy, Chemistry, and the Arts''''', generally known as ''Nicholson's Journal'', was the first monthly  scientific journal in Great Britain. [[William Nicholson (chemist)|William Nicholson]] began it in 1797&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Iain P. Watts|title='We want no authors': William Nicholson and the contested role of the scientific journal in Britain, 1797–1813|journal=The British Journal for the History of Science|pages=397–419|url=http://www.princeton.edu/histgrads/profiles/iwatts/Iain-Watts-We-Want-No-Authors.pdf|accessdate=7 September 2014|doi=10.1017/s0007087413000964|volume=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was the editor until it merged with another journal at the end of 1813.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Nicholson, William (1753-1815) (DNB00)|"Nicholson, William (1753–1815)"]]. [[Dictionary of National Biography]]. London: Smith, Elder &amp; Co. 1885–1900.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicholson's journal would accept short papers, written by new or anonymous authors, and decide whether to publish them relatively quickly. These attributes distinguished the new journal from the established scientific journal ''[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]]''. By one account this less-formal model was so appealing that the next year a similar startup launched, [[Alexander Tilloch]]'s ''[[Philosophical Magazine]]''.&lt;ref name=cw&gt;Russell, Colin. Enterprise and electrolysis... ''Chemistry World'', Aug. 2003 ([http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/Issues/2003/August/electrolysis.asp online])&lt;/ref&gt;

== Significant articles ==
* Nicholson and [[Anthony Carlisle]] split water into hydrogen and oxygen for the first time in 1800 and immediately published their results in the journal. They used [[Volta's pile]] (an electric battery) as soon as they learned of it to achieve this [[electrolysis]].&lt;ref name=cw/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chang, Hasok. 2012. ''Is Water H2O?: Evidence, Realism and Pluralism''. Springer. page 73. ([https://books.google.com/books?id=62kPsTT7XasC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;dq=Lilley+1948+Nicholson's+Journal&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Gz2MdCuRHv&amp;sig=cohLI4RcC0yIJhIooJPzUGqke7U&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=n5AWUqWsIvil4AOvpoDICQ&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Lilley%201948%20Nicholson's%20Journal&amp;f=false online at google books])&lt;/ref&gt;
* Discovery of the element [[palladium]] was announced in 1803. The author chose Nicholson's journal in order to remain anonymous at first, and later revealed himself to be [[William Hyde Wollaston]].&lt;ref name=cw/&gt;
* The journal published the first known [[aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] analysis of [[Glider (aircraft)|gliders]] and [[heavier-than-air]] [[fixed-wing]] [[flying machines]] designs, by [[George Cayley]] in 1809-1810.&lt;ref name="AerNav123"&gt;Cayley, George. "On Aerial Navigation" [http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/fap/OnAerialNavigationPt1.pdf Part 1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511071413/http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/fap/OnAerialNavigationPt1.pdf |date=2013-05-11 }}, [http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/fap/OnAerialNavigationPt2.pdf Part 2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511041814/http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/fap/OnAerialNavigationPt2.pdf |date=2013-05-11 }}, [http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/fap/OnAerialNavigationPt3.pdf Part 3] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511052409/http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/fap/OnAerialNavigationPt3.pdf |date=2013-05-11 }} ''Nicholson's Journal of Natural Philosophy'', 1809–1810. (Via [[NASA]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publishing business ==
By one account, William Nicholson started the journal and made all editorial decisions in a "pioneering and uncertain attempt" to make a living from publishing it. Revenues came only from subscriptions.&lt;ref name=cwl&gt;Chang, 2012, p. 73, also citing Lilley (1948).&lt;/ref&gt; Tilloch's ''Philosophical Magazine'' was more successful as a popular science journal business than Nicholson's journal, according to one source, and another such journal appeared in 1813 (''[[Annals of Philosophy]]'').&lt;ref name=cw/&gt; Possibly partly because of this competition, William Nicholson ended the journal. By some accounts Nicholson's journal simply ceased, and by others it merged in 1814 with the ''Philosophical Magazine'' to form ''The Philosophical Magazine and Journal''.

The "Advertisement", dated 31 December 1813, at the start of Volume 42 of ''The Philosophical Magazine'' &lt;ref&gt;https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/53080#page/20/mode/1up&lt;/ref&gt; states:

"Nearly seventeen years have elapsed since ''The Philosophical Journal'' was commenced by Mr. Nicholson, and sixteen since the appearance of the first number of ''The Philosophical Magazine''. [...] [T]he result of [...] deliberations [between the publishers of ''Nicholson's Philosophical Journal'' and ''The Philosophical Magazine'' in order to respond to readers' complaints regarding duplication of material in the two publications] has been that it would certainly be best that we should unite, and that the joint product of our exertions and our correspondence should be consolidated in one periodical work. [...] The Philosophical Journal will henceforth be discontinued; and The Philosophical Magazine will be conducted by William Nicholson and Alexander Tilloch, in the same manner as it has always been carried on."

For the duration of Volume 43 (January to June 1814) the joint publishers of the new merged journal provided duplicate title-pages for each number, ostensibly so that subscribers to ''Nicholson's Philosophical Magazine'' might be enabled to "preserve their Series without a chasm." However, despite their intention to continue this scheme of two-fold numeration, they abandoned it at the end of this trial period in June 1814, because of the perceived "confusion and risque of many errors" when referring to future volumes; from July 1814 a single numeration was used, following the numbering of ''The Philosophical Magazine.''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/53078#page/15/mode/1up&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''long-range locator''' is a class of devices purported to be a type of [[metal detector]], supposedly able to detect a variety of substances, including gold, drugs and explosives; most are said to operate on a principle of resonance with the material being detected.

==Theory of operation==
Skeptics have examined the internals of many such devices and found those that have been examined to be incapable of operating as advertised, and have dismissed them as overpriced [[dowsing]] rods or similarly useless devices. Virtually all such devices claim to operate on a [[resonance|resonant frequency]] principle where the device is said to emit an electromagnetic signal, either through an antenna or a probe, that will respond to a specific substance such as gold, silver, or sometimes even paper money, and that the device will indicate the presence of such material by indicating a change in direction relative to the operator.

This theory of operation is not supported by scientific theory; the devices have not been shown to work in blind testing, and the resonance principle invoked has not been shown to work in laboratories (and is not consistently employed by LRL manufacturers). In addition, the [[Inverse square law|Inverse-Square Law]] limits the effective possible signal strength of any putative LRL; moreover, not only does this attenuation apply to the supposed emissions from the LRL devices, but the return signals from the sought-after targets are further attenuated by the same constraints. Since most of these LRL devices are powered by low voltage, low current AA, AAA or 9v cells, the resultant power available for emissions is quite minuscule at best, and the return signal would suffer even greater attenuation. Examples exist of LRL devices having no internal power source at all, and these are advertised as being self-powered or powered by ambient [[static electricity]]; these are indistinguishable from dowsing rods.

==Scientific evaluation==

Many such devices contain non-functional circuitry or naively constructed approximations of radio transmitters. A few do have functional circuitry, putting out a weak signal with a function generator or a simple timer circuit, but are still largely useless in comparison with a coil-based metal detector; others have been found to contain intentionally obfuscated or completely superfluous components (from individual components such as inductors or ribbon cables up to, in some cases, pocket [[calculator]]s), often indicative of intentional fraud, incompetence, or both, by the designer. Such functioning circuitry as exists in such devices usually has no obvious way (motor, solenoid, etc.) to connect to any rotating joint in the device either, meaning the devices are often entirely dependent on the [[ideomotor effect]] to function.

==Media exposure and controversy==

Author [[Tom Clancy]] came under fire for including the DKL Lifeguard,&lt;ref&gt;[http://skepdic.com/refuge/dkl.html skepdic.com: DKL Lifeguard]&lt;/ref&gt; a long-range locator purported to be useful for detecting people, in critical passages of his novel ''[[Rainbow Six]]''. A study by [[Sandia National Laboratories]] proved the Lifeguard to be completely useless,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.prod.sandia.gov/cgi-bin/techlib/access-control.pl/1998/980977.pdf |title=Double-Blind Evaluation of the DKL LifeGuard Model 2 |date=April 29, 1998 |publisher=Sandia National Laboratories |last1=Murray |first1=Dale W. |last2=Spencer |first2=Floyd W. |last3=Spencer |first3=Debra D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other designs by the Lifeguard's creator Thomas Afilani have been shown to contain numerous dummy components with no clear function.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8215">The idea that there are specific '''marine counterparts to land creatures''',&lt;ref&gt;Succinctly expressed by [[Terence Hanbury White|T. H. White]], "It used to be a common belief that everything on the earth had its counterpart in the sea" ([[Terence Hanbury White|T. H. White]], Kenneth Frazier, ''Bestiary: Being a Translation of a Latin Bestiary of the Twelfth Century'' (London, 1954), reissued as ''The Book of Beasts'' 1960:250ff).&lt;/ref&gt; inherited from the writers on [[natural history]] in [[classical antiquity|Antiquity]], was firmly believed in [[Islam]]&lt;ref&gt;See Hasan M. El-Shamy, ''Folk traditions of the Arab world: a guide to motif classification'', 1995, under F133.1, Marine counterpart to land.&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Medieval Europe]], and is exemplified by the creatures represented in the medieval animal encyclopedias called [[Bestiary|bestiaries]] and in the parallels drawn in the moralising attributes attached to each. "The creation was a mathematical diagram drawn in parallel lines," T. H. White said a propos the bestiary he translated. "Things did not only have a moral they often had physical counterparts in other strata. There was a horse in the land and a sea-horse in the sea. For that matter there was probably a [[Pegasus]] in heaven".&lt;ref&gt;T.H. White, ''op. cit'' p 245.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of perfect analogies in the fauna of land and sea was considered part of the perfect [[symmetry]]&lt;ref&gt;The "perfection" of symmetry was an idea highly developed in the [[Pythagoras|Pythagorean tradition]].&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Creator_deity|Creator]]'s plan, offered as the "[[book of nature]]" to mankind, for which a text could be found in ''[[Book of Job|Job]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;But ask the animals, and they will teach you, or the birds of the air, and they will tell you; or speak to the earth, and it will teach you, or let the fish of the sea inform you. Which of all these does not know that the hand of the Lord has done this? In his hand is the life of every creature and the breath of all mankind.&lt;ref&gt;Job 12:7–10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The idea appears in the Jewish Tannaic sources as well, as brought down in Babylonian Talmud, Chulin 127a. Rashi (Psalms 49:2) traces this to a biblical source – the land is referred to as "Chaled", from the weasel (chulda), because the weasel is the only animal on dry land that does not have its counterpart in the sea.
 
All of [[Genesis creation myth|Creation]] was considered to reflect the Creator, and Man could learn about the Creator through studying the Creation, an assumption that underlies the "[[watchmaker analogy]]" offered as a proof of God's existence.

The correspondence between the realms of earth and sea, extending to its denizens, offers examples of the taste for [[allegory]] engendered by Christian and Islamic methods of [[exegesis]], which also encouraged the [[doctrine of signatures]], a "key" to the meaning and use of herbs.

The source text that was most influential in compiling the bestiaries of the 12th and 13th centuries was the ''[[Physiologus]]'', one of the most widely read and copied secular texts of the Middle Ages. Written in Greek in Alexandria the 2nd century CE and accumulating further "exemplary" beasts in the next three centuries and more, ''Physiologus'' was transmitted in the West in Latin, and eventually translated into many vernacular languages: many manuscripts in various languages survive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bestiary.ca/intro.htm David Badke, "The Medieval Bestiary: Introduction"]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]], ''On the Characteristics of Animals'' (A. F. Scholfield, in [[Loeb Classical Library]], 1958).

Christian writers, trained in [[Anagoge|anagogical thinking]] and expecting to find spiritual instruction inherent in the processes of Nature, disregarded the caveat in [[Pliny's Natural History]],&lt;ref&gt;''Historia Naturalis''IX.2.&lt;/ref&gt; where the idea is presented as a "vulgar opinion": 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Hence it is that the vulgar notion may very possibly be true, that whatever is produced in any other department of Nature, is to be found in the sea as well; while, at the same time, many other productions are there to be found which nowhere else exist. That there are to be found in the sea the forms, not only of terrestrial animals, but of inanimate objects even, is easily to be understood by all who will take the trouble to examine the grape-fish, the sword-fish, the sawfish, and the cucumber-fish, which last so strongly resembles the real cucumber both in colour and in smell.&lt;ref&gt;Translation of [[John Bostock (physician)|John Bostock]] and [[Henry Thomas Riley]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] points out that many more things are found in the sea than on the land, and also mentions the correspondences that may be discovered between many non-living objects of the land and living creatures in the sea. 

Saint [[Augustine of Hippo]] reasons based on [[analogy]], that since there is a serpent in the grass, there must be an eel in the sea; because there is a [[Leviathan]] in the sea, there must be a [[Behemoth]] on the land. (''City of God''? xi.15?)

&lt;!--this doctrine doesn't appear in the on-line translation of excerpts:[[Isidore of Seville]]'s encyclopedic ''Etymologiae'',&lt;ref&gt;''Etymologiae'' XII?&lt;/ref&gt; contained a section about animals, derived from Classical authors such as [[Pliny the Elder]].--&gt; 
The reaction to such anagogical thinking set in with the unfolding of critical [[Scientific thinking|scientific thought]] in the 17th century. Sir [[Thomas Browne]] devoted a chapter of his ''[[Pseudodoxia Epidemica]]'' to dispelling such a belief: Chapter XXIV: "That all Animals in the land are in their kinde&lt;!--kinde in original--&gt; in the Sea."&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/pseudodoxia/pseudo324.html On-line text].&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] the ancient conception was given an innovative and rationalized cast by [[Benoît de Maillet]] in describing the transformations and metamorphoses undergone by creatures of the sea to render them fit for life on land, a proto-evolutionist concept, though it was based on superficial morphological similarities:
&lt;blockquote&gt;There are in the Sea, Fish of almost all the Figures of Land-Animals, and even of Birds. She includes Plants, Flowers, and some Fruits; the Nettle, the Rose, the [[Dianthus|Pink]], the Melon and the Grape, are to be found there.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
As for the Quadrupeds, we not only find in the Sea, Species of the same Figure and Inclinations, and in the Waves living on the same Aliments by which they are nourished on Land, we have also Examples of those Species living equally in the Air and in the Water. Have not the Sea-Apes precisely the same figure with those of the Land?&lt;ref&gt;Maillet, ''Telliamed'': "Sixth Day: Origin of Man and Animals"; this and several further passages are quoted in Mary Efrosini Gregory, ''Evolutionism in Eighteenth-century French Thought'' :22f., 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Though in ''[[Moby-Dick]]'' Ishmael, with a nod to Sir Thomas Browne's wording, denies the claim that land animals find their counterparts in the sea,&lt;blockquote&gt;For though some old naturalists have maintained that all creatures of the land are of their kind in the sea; and though taking a broad general view of the thing, this may very well be; yet coming to specialties, where, for example, does the ocean furnish any fish that in disposition answers to the sagacious kindness of the dog? The accursed shark alone can in any generic respect be said to bear comparative analogy to him.&lt;ref&gt;''Moby-Dick'', ch. 58 "Brit".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
in discussing [[dolphin]]s trained to aid scuba divers, a 1967 ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'' article could still casually state: "It's hoped that the marine counterparts of some land animals can be trained to become useful members of the [[SEALAB (United States Navy)|Man-in-the-Sea program]]."&lt;ref&gt;Tom Stimson, "Lifeguards: Friendly dolphins— the mammals with the high IQ— are being trained for undersea rescue missions", ''Popular Mechanics'', July 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21678">{{redirect distinguish|Mechanistic materialism|Mechanistic Materialism}}
'''Mechanism''' is the belief that natural wholes (principally living things) are like complicated machines or artifacts, composed of parts lacking any intrinsic relationship to each other. Thus, the source of an apparent thing's activities is not the whole itself, but its parts or an external influence on the parts.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

The doctrine of mechanism in [[philosophy]] comes in two different flavors. They are both doctrines of [[metaphysics]], but they are different in scope and ambitions: the first is a global doctrine about nature; the second is a local doctrine about humans and their minds, which is hotly contested. For clarity, we might distinguish these two doctrines as [[universal mechanism]] and [[anthropic mechanism]].

{{quote|There is no constant meaning in the history of philosophy for the word Mechanism. Originally, the term meant that cosmological theory which ascribes the motion and changes of the world to some external force. In this view material things are purely passive, while according to the opposite theory (i. e., Dynamism), they possess certain internal sources of energy which account for the activity of each and for its influence on the course of events; These meanings, however, soon underwent modification. The question as to whether motion is an inherent property of bodies, or has been communicated to them by some external agency, was very often ignored. With a large number of cosmologists the essential feature of Mechanism is the attempt to reduce all the qualities and activities of bodies to quantitative realities, i. e. to mass and motion. But a further modification soon followed. Living bodies, as is well known, present at first sight certain characteristic properties which have no counterpart in lifeless matter. Mechanism aims to go beyond these appearances. It seeks to explain all "vital" phenomena as physical and chemical facts; whether or not these facts are in turn reducible to mass and motion becomes a secondary question, although Mechanists are generally inclined to favour such reduction. The theory opposed to this biological mechanism is no longer Dynamism, but Vitalism or Neo-vitalism, which maintains that vital activities cannot be explained, and never will be explained, by the laws which govern lifeless matter.&lt;ref name="CE1913"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Mechanism |encyclopedia=Catholic Encyclopedia |date=1913 |url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Catholic_Encyclopedia_(1913)/Mechanism}}&lt;/ref&gt;|"Mechanism" in ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' (1913)}}

== Universal mechanism&lt;!--'Universal mechanism' redirects here--&gt; ==

The older doctrine, here called '''universal mechanism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, is the ancient philosophies closely linked with [[materialism]] and [[reductionism]], especially that of the [[atomism|atomists]] and to a large extent, [[stoicism|stoic physics]]. They held that the universe is reducible to completely mechanical principles—that is, the [[motion (physics)|motion]] and collision of [[matter]]. Later mechanists believed the achievements of the [[scientific revolution]] had shown that all phenomena could eventually be explained in terms of 'mechanical' laws, natural laws governing the motion and collision of matter that implied a thorough going [[determinism]]: if ''all'' phenomena could be explained ''entirely'' through the motion of matter under the laws of [[classical physics]], then even more surely than the gears of a clock determine that it must strike 2:00 an hour after striking 1:00, ''all'' phenomena must be completely determined: whether past, present or future. (One of the philosophical implications of modern [[quantum mechanics]] is that this view of determinism is not defensible.)

The French mechanist and determinist [[Pierre Simon de Laplace]] formulated the sweeping implications of this thesis by saying:

{{quote|We may regard the present state of the universe as the effect of the past and the cause of the future. An intellect which at any given moment knew all of the forces that animate nature and the mutual positions of the beings that compose it, if this intellect were vast enough to submit the data to analysis, could condense into a single formula the movement of the greatest bodies of the universe and that of the lightest [[atom]]; for such an intellect nothing could be uncertain and the future just like the past would be present before its eyes.|Pierre Simon Laplace|''A Philosophical Essay on Probabilities''}}

One of the first and most famous expositions of universal mechanism is found in the opening passages of ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' by [[Thomas Hobbes]] (1651). What is less frequently appreciated is that [[René Descartes]] was a staunch mechanist, though today, in the [[philosophy of mind]], he is remembered for introducing the [[mind–body problem]] in terms of [[Mind-body dualism|dualism]] and [[physicalism]].

Descartes was a [[substance dualist]], and argued that reality was composed of two radically different types of substance: extended [[matter]], on the one hand, and immaterial [[mind]], on the other. Descartes argued that one cannot explain the conscious mind in terms of the spatial dynamics of mechanistic bits of matter cannoning off each other. Nevertheless, his understanding of biology was thoroughly mechanistic in nature:

:"I should like you to consider that these functions (including passion, memory, and imagination) follow from the mere arrangement of the machine’s organs every bit as naturally as the movements of a clock or other automaton follow from the arrangement of its counter-weights and wheels." (Descartes, Treatise on Man, p.108)

His scientific work was based on the traditional mechanistic understanding that animals and humans are completely mechanistic [[automaton|automata]]. Descartes' dualism was motivated by the seeming impossibility that mechanical dynamics could yield mental experiences.

[[Isaac Newton]] ushered in a much weaker acceptation of mechanism that tolerated the antithetical, and as yet inexplicable, [[action at a distance]] of [[gravity]]. However, his work seemed to successfully predict the motion of both celestial and terrestrial bodies according to that principle, and the generation of philosophers who were inspired by Newton's example carried the mechanist banner nonetheless. Chief among them were French [[philosophy|philosophers]] such as [[Julien Offray de La Mettrie]] and [[Denis Diderot]] (see also: [[French materialism]]).

== Anthropic mechanism&lt;!--'Anthropic mechanism' redirects here--&gt; ==

The thesis in '''anthropic mechanism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is not that everything can be completely explained in mechanical terms (although some anthropic mechanists may ''also'' believe that), but rather that everything ''about human beings'' can be completely explained in mechanical terms, as surely as can everything about clocks or the internal combustion engine.

One of the chief obstacles that all mechanistic theories have faced is providing a mechanistic explanation of the human [[mind]]; Descartes, for one, endorsed [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] in spite of endorsing a completely mechanistic conception of the material world because he argued that mechanism and the notion of a mind were logically incompatible. Hobbes, on the other hand, conceived of the mind and the will as purely mechanistic, completely explicable in terms of the effects of perception and the pursuit of desire, which in turn he held to be completely explicable in terms of the materialistic operations of the nervous system. Following Hobbes, other mechanists argued for a thoroughly mechanistic explanation of the mind, with one of the most influential and controversial expositions of the doctrine being offered by [[Julien Offray de La Mettrie]] in his ''Man a Machine'' (1748).

Today, as in the past, the main points of debate between anthropic mechanists and anti-mechanists are mainly occupied with two topics: the mind — and consciousness, in particular — and [[free will]]. Anti-mechanists argue that anthropic mechanism is incompatible with our commonsense intuitions: in [[philosophy of mind]] they argue that unconscious matter cannot completely explain the phenomenon of consciousness, and in [[metaphysics]] they argue that anthropic mechanism implies determinism about human action, which (they argue) is incompatible with our understanding of ourselves as creatures with [[free will]]. Contemporary philosophers who have argued for this position include [[Norman Malcolm]] and
[[David Chalmers]].

Anthropic mechanists typically respond in one of two ways. In the first, they agree with anti-mechanists that mechanism conflicts with some of our commonsense intuitions, but go on to argue that our commonsense intuitions are simply mistaken and need to be revised. Down this path lies [[eliminative materialism]] in [[philosophy of mind]], and [[hard determinism]] on the question of free will. This option is accepted by the eliminative materialist philosopher [[Paul Churchland]]. Some have questioned how eliminative materialism is compatible with the freedom of will apparently required for anyone (including its adherents) to make truth claims.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Jonas, ''The Phenomenon of Life: Toward a Philosophical Biology'' (Evanston, Illinois: Northwestern University Press, 2001/1966), p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; The second option, common amongst philosophers who adopt anthropic mechanism, is to argue that the [[argument]]s given for incompatibility are specious: whatever it is we mean by "consciousness" and "free will," they urge, it is fully compatible with a mechanistic understanding of the human mind and will. As a result, they tend to argue for one or another non-eliminativist [[Physicalism|physicalist]] theories of mind, and for [[compatibilism]] on the question of free will. Contemporary philosophers who have argued for this sort of account include [[J. J. C. Smart]] and [[Daniel Dennett]].

===Gödelian arguments&lt;!--'Gödelian argument' and 'Gödelian arguments' redirect here--&gt;===
Some scholars have debated over what, if anything, [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]] imply about anthropic mechanism. Much of the debate centers on whether the human mind is equivalent to a [[Turing machine]], or by the [[Church-Turing thesis]], any finite machine at all. If it is, and if the machine is [[Consistency|consistent]], then Gödel's incompleteness theorems would apply to it.

'''Gödelian arguments'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; claim that a system of human mathematicians (or some idealization of human mathematicians) is both consistent and powerful enough to recognize its own consistency. Since this is impossible for a Turing machine, the Gödelian concludes that human reasoning must be non-mechanical.

However, the modern consensus in the scientific and mathematical community is that actual human reasoning is inconsistent; that any consistent "idealized version" ''H'' of human reasoning would logically be forced to adopt a healthy but counter-intuitive open-minded skepticism about the consistency of ''H'' (otherwise ''H'' is provably inconsistent); and that Gödel's theorems do not lead to any valid argument against mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=[[Graham Oppy]]|title=Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/goedel-incompleteness/#GdeArgAgaMec|website=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|accessdate=27 April 2016|date=20 January 2015|quote=These Gödelian anti-mechanist arguments are, however, problematic, and there is wide consensus that they fail.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=[[Stuart J.

An introduction to the philosophy of mathematics. [[Cambridge University Press]], 2012. From 2.2.2, 'Philosophical significance of Gödel's incompleteness results': "The accepted wisdom (with which I concur) is that the Lucas-Penrose arguments fail."&lt;/ref&gt; This consensus that Gödelian anti-mechanist arguments are doomed to failure is laid out strongly in ''[[Artificial Intelligence (journal)|Artificial Intelligence]]'': "''any'' attempt to utilize (Gödel's incompleteness results) to attack the [[computationalism|computationalist]] thesis is bound to be illegitimate, since these results are quite consistent with the computationalist thesis."&lt;ref name=laforte&gt;LaForte, G., Hayes, P. J., Ford, K. M. 1998. Why Gödel's theorem cannot refute computationalism. [[Artificial Intelligence (journal)|Artificial Intelligence]], 104:265-286, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

====History====
One of the earliest attempts to use incompleteness to reason about human intelligence was by Gödel himself in his 1951 [[Josiah Willard Gibbs Lectureship|Gibbs Lecture]] entitled "Some basic theorems on the foundations of mathematics and their philosophical implications".&lt;ref&gt;[[Kurt Gödel|Gödel, Kurt]], 1951, ''Some basic theorems on the foundations of mathematics and their implications'' in  [[Solomon Feferman]], ed., 1995. ''Collected works / Kurt Gödel, Vol. III''. Oxford University Press: 304-23.&lt;/ref&gt;  In this lecture, Gödel uses the incompleteness theorem to arrive at the following disjunction: (a) the human mind is not a consistent finite machine, or (b) there exist [[Diophantine equations]] for which it cannot decide whether solutions exist. Gödel finds (b) implausible, and thus seems to have believed the human mind was not equivalent to a finite machine, i.e., its power exceeded that of any finite machine. He recognized that this was only a conjecture, since one could never disprove (b). Yet he considered the disjunctive conclusion to be a "certain fact".

In subsequent years, more direct anti-mechanist lines of reasoning were apparently floating around the intellectual atmosphere. In 1960, [[Hilary Putnam]] published a paper entitled "Minds and Machines," in which he points out the flaws of a typical anti-mechanist argument.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hilary Putnam|Putnam, Hilary]], 1960, ''Minds and Machines'' in [[Sidney Hook]], ed., ''Dimensions of Mind: A Symposium''. New York University Press. Reprinted in Anderson, A. R., ed., 1964. ''Minds and Machines''. Prentice-Hall: 77.&lt;/ref&gt;  Informally, this is the argument that the (alleged) difference between "what can be mechanically proven" and "what can be seen to be true by humans" shows that human intelligence is not mechanical in nature. Or, as Putnam puts it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Let T be a Turing machine which "represents" me in the sense that T can prove just the mathematical statements I prove. Then using Gödel's technique I can discover a proposition that T cannot prove, and moreover I can prove this proposition. This refutes the assumption that T "represents" me, hence I am not a Turing machine.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Hilary Putnam]] objects that this argument ignores the issue of consistency. Gödel's technique can only be applied to consistent systems. It is conceivable, argues Putnam, that the human mind is inconsistent. If one is to use Gödel's technique to prove the proposition that T cannot prove, one must first prove (the mathematical statement representing) the consistency of T, a daunting and perhaps impossible task. Later Putnam suggested that while Gödel's theorems cannot be applied to humans, since they make mistakes and are therefore inconsistent, it may be applied to the human faculty of science or mathematics in general. If we are to believe that it is consistent, then either we cannot prove its consistency, or it cannot be represented by a Turing machine.&lt;ref&gt;The Gödel Theorem and Human Nature, a talk given by [[Hilary Putnam]] in the Gödel centenary 2006  [http://www.logic.at/goedel2006/abstract.php?putnam]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[J. R. Lucas]] in ''[[Minds, Machines and Gödel]]'' (1961), and later in his book ''The Freedom of the Will'' (1970), lays out an anti-mechanist argument closely following the one described by Putnam, including reasons for why the human mind can be considered consistent.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Lucas (philosopher)|Lucas, J. R.]], 1961, "[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~jrlucas/Godel/mmg.html Minds, Machines, and Gödel.]" ''Philosophy 36'':112-27.&lt;/ref&gt;  Lucas admits that, by Gödel's second theorem, a human mind cannot formally prove its own consistency, and even says (perhaps facetiously) that women and politicians are inconsistent. Nevertheless, he sets out arguments for why a male non-politician can be considered consistent. These arguments are philosophical in nature and are the subject of much debate; Lucas provides references to responses on his own [http://users.ox.ac.uk/~jrlucas/Godel/referenc.html website].

Another work was done by [[Judson Webb]] in his 1968 paper "Metamathematics and the Philosophy of Mind".&lt;ref&gt;[[Judson Webb|Webb, Judson]], 1968, "Metamathematics and the Philosophy of Mind," ''Philosophy of Science 35'': 156-78.&lt;/ref&gt;  Webb claims that previous attempts have glossed over whether one truly can see that the Gödelian statement ''p'' pertaining to oneself, is true. Using a different formulation of Gödel's theorems, namely, that of [[Raymond Smullyan]] and [[Emil Post]], Webb shows one can derive convincing arguments for oneself of both the truth and falsity of ''p''. He furthermore argues that all arguments about the philosophical implications of Gödel's theorems are really arguments about whether the [[Church-Turing thesis]] is true.

Later, [[Roger Penrose]] entered the fray, providing somewhat novel anti-mechanist arguments in his books, ''[[The Emperor's New Mind]]''  (1989) [ENM] and ''[[Shadows of the Mind]]'' (1994) [SM]. These books have proved highly controversial.  [[Martin Davis]] responded to ENM in his paper [http://www.cs.nyu.edu/cs/faculty/davism/penrose.ps "Is Mathematical Insight Algorithmic?" (ps)], where he argues that Penrose ignores the issue of consistency.  [[Solomon Feferman]] gives a critical examination of SM in his paper [http://math.stanford.edu/~feferman/papers/penrose.pdf "Penrose's Gödelian argument" (pdf)].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} The response of the scientific community to Penrose's arguments has been negative, with one group of scholars calling Penrose's repeated attempts to form a persuasive Gödelian argument "a kind of intellectual shell game, in which a precisely defined notion to which a mathematical result applies... is switched for a vaguer notion".&lt;ref name=laforte /&gt;

A Gödel-based anti-mechanism argument can be found in [[Douglas Hofstadter]]'s book ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid]]'', though Hofstadter is widely viewed as a known skeptic of such arguments:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Looked at this way, Gödel's proof suggests – though by no means does it prove! – that there could be some high-level way of viewing the mind/brain, involving concepts which do not appear on lower levels, and that this level might have explanatory power that does not exist – not even in principle – on lower levels. It would mean that some facts could be explained on the high level quite easily, but not on  lower levels at all. No matter how long and cumbersome a low-level statement were made, it would not explain the phenomena in question.
It is analogous to the fact that, if you make derivation after derivation in [[Peano arithmetic]], no matter how long and cumbersome you make them, you will never come up with one for G – despite the fact that on a higher level, you can see that the [[Gödel sentence]] is true.

What might such high-level concepts be? It has been proposed for eons, by various holistically or "soulistically" inclined scientists and humanists that consciousness is a phenomenon that escapes explanation in terms of brain components; so here is a candidate at least. There is also the ever-puzzling notion of free will. So perhaps these qualities could be "emergent" in the sense of requiring explanations which cannot be furnished by the physiology alone
  (''Gödel, Escher, Bach'', p. 708).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rationology.net/eGodel.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12671">[[File:Open research.ogv|500px|thumb|thumbtime=43|Open research is concerned with making scientific research more transparent, more collaborative and more efficient. A central aspect to it is to provide [[open access]] to scientific information, especially to the research published in [[scholarly journal]]s and to the underlying [[scientific data|data]], much of which traditional science tends to hide away. Other aspects are more open forms of collaboration and engagement with a wider audience, including [[citizen science|citizen scientists]] and the public at large.]]

'''Open research''' is research conducted in the spirit of [[free and open-source software]]. Much like open-source schemes that are built around a [[source code]] that is made public, the central theme of open research is to make clear accounts of the methodology freely available via the internet, along with any data or results extracted or derived from them. This permits a massively distributed collaboration, and one in which anyone may participate at any level of the project.

Especially if the research is scientific in nature, it is frequently referred to as [[open science]].&lt;ref&gt;For an overview, see [https://www.amazon.com/Reinventing-Discovery-New-Networked-Science/dp/0691148902/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1319948131&amp;sr=1-1 "Reinventing Discovery"] by Michael Nielsen, Princeton University Press (21 October 2011), {{ISBN|0-691-14890-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Woelfle|first=Michael|author2=Olliaro, Piero |author3=Todd, Matthew H. |title=Open science is a research accelerator|journal=Nature Chemistry|date=23 September 2011|volume=3|issue=10|pages=745–748|doi=10.1038/nchem.1149|url=http://www.nature.com/nchem/journal/v3/n10/full/nchem.1149.html|accessdate=16 October 2013|pmid=21941234|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Open research'' can also include [[social sciences]], the [[humanities]], [[mathematics]], engineering and medicine.

== Types of open projects ==
Important distinctions exist between different types of open projects.

Projects that provide open data but don't offer open collaboration are referred to as "[[Open access (publishing)|open access]]" rather than open research. Providing [[open data]] is a necessary but not sufficient condition for open research, because although the data may be used by anyone, there is no [[Share-alike|requirement for subsequent research to take place openly]]. For example, though there have been many calls for more open collaborative research in drug discovery&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hopkins|first=Andrew L.|author2=Witty, Michael J. |author3=Nwaka, Solomon |title=Neglected Diseases Mission possible|journal=Nature|date=13 September 2007|volume=449|issue=7159|pages=166–169|doi=10.1038/449166a|pmid=17851512|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v449/n7159/full/449166a.html|accessdate=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the open deposition of large amounts of data,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v465/n7296/full/nature09107.html F. -J. Gamo, et al. Thousands of chemical starting points for antimalarial lead identification. ''Nature'' '''2010''', ''465'', 305–310]&lt;/ref&gt; there are very few active, openly collaborative projects in this area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://openwetware.org/wiki/Open_Source_Drug_Discovery Open Source Drug Discovery wiki]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osdd.net/ Indian Open Source Drug Discovery portal]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mendeley.com/groups/1150251/open-source-drug-discovery/ Mendeley Group on Open Source Drug Discovery]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Crowdsourcing]] projects that recruit large numbers of participants to carry out small tasks which are then assembled into a larger project outcome have delivered significant research outcomes,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nature09304 S. Cooper, ''et al.'' Predicting protein structures with a multiplayer online game. ''Nature'' '''2010''' ''466'', 756–760]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/j.1365-2966.2008.13490.x K. Land et al. Galaxy Zoo: the large-scale spin statistics of spiral galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, ''Mon. Not. R. Astron. Soc.'' '''2008''', ''388'', 1686–1692]&lt;/ref&gt; but these projects are distinct from those in which participants are able to influence the overall direction of the research, or in which participants are expected to have creative input into the science behind the project.

Most open research is conducted within existing research groups. Primary research data are posted which can be added to, or interpreted by, anyone who has the necessary expertise and who can therefore join the collaborative effort. Thus the "end product" of the project (which may still be subject to future expansion or modification) arises from many contributions across multiple research groups, rather than the effort of one group or individual. Open research is therefore distinct from open access in that the output of open research is prone to change with time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Todd|first=Matthew H.|title=Open access and open source in chemistry|journal=Chemistry Central Journal|date=1 January 2007|volume=1|issue=1|pages=3|doi=10.1186/1752-153X-1-3|pmid=17939849|pmc=1975827|url=http://journal.chemistrycentral.com/content/1/1/3|accessdate=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike open access, true open research must demonstrate live, online collaboration. Project websites that demonstrate this capability have started to become available.&lt;ref name=TSL&gt;[http://www.thesynapticleap.org/ The Synaptic Leap]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MIAWiki&gt;[http://confocal-manawatu.pbworks.com/w/page/49706793/MIAWiki%20Real-Time%20Collaboration/ MIAWiki for Open Research and Collaboration]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, open research became more mainstream with web based platforms such as [[figshare]] continuing to grow in terms of users and publicly available outputs.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, S: [http://research.gigaom.com/2013/12/tools-for-sharing-open-research-materials-zenodo-and-figshare/ Tools for sharing open research materials]

The Transparency and Openness Promotion (TOP) Committee met in 2014 to address one key element of the incentive systems: journals' procedures and policies for publication. The committee consisted of disciplinary leaders, journal editors, funding agency representatives, and disciplinary experts largely from the social and behavioral sciences. By developing shared standards for open practices across journals, the committee said it hopes to translate scientific norms and values into concrete actions and change the current incentive structures to drive researchers' behavior toward more openness.&lt;ref name=Science-Mag-2015-06-26/&gt; The committee said it sought to produce guidelines that (a) focus on the commonalities across disciplines, and that (b) define what aspects of the research process should be made available to the community to evaluate, critique, reuse, and extend. The committee added that the guidelines aim to help improve journal policies in order to help transparency, openness, and reproducibility "become more evident in daily practice and ultimately improve the public trust in science, and science itself."&lt;ref name="Science-Mag-2015-06-26"&gt;B.

[[File:Common clownfish.jpg|thumb|170px|right|Is it material composition, or organization of parts, that creates the mutual [[symbiosis]] between [[Amphiprion]] [[clownfish]] and tropical [[sea anemone]]s?]]
'''Organicism''' is the philosophical perspective which views the [[universe]] and its parts as organic wholes and – either by analogy or literally – as living organisms.&lt;ref&gt;"The theory that everything in nature has an organic basis or is part of an organic whole" [[OED]]&lt;/ref&gt; It can be synonymous with [[holism]].&lt;ref&gt;''ibid''&lt;/ref&gt; Organicism is an important tradition within the history of [[natural philosophy]]&lt;ref&gt;For example, the philosophers of the [[Ionian Enlightenment]] were referred to by later philosophers (such as Aristotle) as ''[[Hylozoism|hylozoists]]'' meaning 'those who thought that matter was alive' (see [[Benjamin Farrington|Farrington]] (1941/53)&lt;/ref&gt; where it has remained as a vital current alongside [[reductionism]] and [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanism]], the approaches that have dominated science since the seventeenth century.&lt;ref&gt;For a general overview see [[Fritjof Capra|Capra]] (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plato]] is among the earliest philosophers to have regarded the universe as an intelligent living being (see ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]''). Organicism flourished for a period during the era of [[German romanticism]]&lt;ref&gt;In particular the writings of [[Friedrich Schelling]] and [[Goethe]]&lt;/ref&gt; during which time the new science of biology was first defined by [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]]. Within modern-day [[Biology|biological]] [[sciences]] organicism is the approach that stresses the organization (particularly the [[self-organization|self-organizing]] properties), rather than the composition, of [[organism]]s. [[John Scott Haldane]] was the first biologist to use the term to describe his philosophical views in 1917, after which it was followed by certain other biologists in the 20th century.

==In philosophy==

Organicism as a doctrine rejects mechanism and [[reductionism]] (doctrines that claim that the smallest parts by themselves explain the behavior of larger organized systems of which they are a part). However, organicism also rejects [[vitalism]], the doctrine that there is a vital force different from physical forces that accounts for living things. As Capra&lt;ref name= "Capra" &gt;Fritjof Capra. The Web of Life: A New Scientific Understanding of Living Systems. Anchor Books Doubleday, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; puts it, both schools, organicism and vitalism, were born from the quest for getting rid of the Cartesian picture of reality, a view that has been claimed to be the most destructive paradigm nowadays, from science to politics.&lt;ref&gt;What The Bleep Do We Know – Down The Rabbit Hole. Samuel Goldwyn Films. Roadside attractions. Documentary film, Drama. February 3, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
A number of biologists in the early to mid-twentieth century embraced organicism. They wished to reject earlier vitalisms but to stress that whole organism biology was not fully explainable by atomic mechanism. The larger organization of an organic system has features that must be taken into account to explain its behavior.

Gilbert and Sarkar distinguish organicism from holism to avoid what they see as the vitalistic or spiritualistic connotations of holism. Dusek notes that holism contains a continuum of degrees of the top-down control of organization, ranging from [[monism]] (the doctrine that the only complete object is the whole universe, or that there is only one entity, the universe)  to organicism, which allows relatively more independence of the parts from the whole, despite the whole being more than the sum of the parts, and/or the whole exerting some control on the behavior of the parts.

Still more independence is present in relational holism. This doctrine does not assert top-down control of the whole over its parts, but does claim that the relations of the parts are essential to explanation of behavior of the system. Aristotle and early modern philosophers and scientists tended to describe reality as made of substances and their qualities, and to neglect relations. [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] showed the bizarre conclusions to which a doctrine of the non-existence of relations led. Twentieth century philosophy has been characterized by the introduction of and emphasis on the importance of relations, whether in [[symbolic logic]], in [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], or in metaphysics.

[[William C. Wimsatt|William Wimsatt]] has suggested that the number of terms in the relations considered distinguishes reductionism from holism. Reductionistic explanations claim that two or at most three term relations are sufficient to account for the system's behavior. At the other extreme the system could be considered as a single ten to the twenty-sixth term relation, for instance.

Organicism has some intellectually and politically controversial or suspect associations. "Holism," the doctrine that the whole is more than the sum of its parts, often used synonymously with organicism, or as a broader category under which organicism falls, has been co-opted in recent decades by "[[holistic medicine]]" and by [[New Age]] Thought. German [[Nazism]] appealed to organicist and holistic doctrines, discrediting for many in retrospect, the original organicist doctrines. (See Anne Harrington). Soviet [[Dialectical Materialism]] also made appeals to an holistic and organicist approach stemming from [[Hegel]] via [[Karl Marx]]'s co-worker [[Friedrich Engels]], again giving a controversial political association to organicism.

Organicism' has also been used to characterize notions put forth by various late 19th-century social scientists who considered human society to be analogous to an organism, and individual humans to be analogous to the cells of an organism. This sort of organicist sociology was articulated by Alfred Espinas, [[Paul von Lilienfeld]], Jacques Novicow, [[Albert Schäffle]], [[Herbert Spencer]], and [[René Worms]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;Daniela Barberis, "In search of an object: organicist sociology and the reality of society in fin-de-siècle France", History of the Human Sciences, Vol. 16, No. 3, 2003. Page 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Hobbes]] arguably put forward a form of organicism. In the ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'', he argued that the state is like a secular God whose constituents (individual people) make up a larger organism.

==In biology==

In breathing entities, cells – i.e., the smallest unit of life – were first observed in the 17th century, when the multifaceted equipment microscope was conceived. Before that period, the individual organisms were studied as a whole in a field known as organismic biology; that area of research remains an important component of the biological sciences.&lt;ref&gt;"biology". Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2016. Web. 19 Jan. 2016 &lt;http://www.britannica.com/science/biology&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, as Capra&lt;ref name= "Capra" /&gt; puts it, during the early 1900s, the quantum researchers struggled with the same paradigm shift from "the parts to the whole" that culminated into the scholars of organismic biology.

In biology organicism considers that the observable structures of life, its overall form and the properties and characteristics of its component parts are  a result of the reciprocal play of all the components on each other.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.jstor.org/pss/3745903 https://www.jstor.org/pss/3745903 Organicism in Biology]'', Joseph Needham,  Journal of Philosophical Studies''  1928 . Accessed Jan 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
Examples of 20th century biologists who were organicists are [[Ross Granville Harrison|Ross Harrison]], [[Paul Alfred Weiss|Paul Weiss]], and [[Joseph Needham]]. [[Donna Haraway]] discusses them in her first book ''Crystals, Fabrics, and Fields''. [[John Scott Haldane]] (father of [[J. B. S. Haldane]]), [[William Emerson Ritter]], [[E. S. Russell|Edward Stuart Russell]], [[Joseph Henry Woodger]], [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]], and Ralph Stayner Lillie are other early twentieth century organicists. [[Robert Rosen (theoretical biologist)|Robert Rosen]], founder of "Relational Biology" provided a comprehensive mathematical and category-theoretic treatment of irreducible causal relations he believed to be responsible for life.&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, R. 1991. "Life Itself: A Comprehensive Inquiry Into the Nature, Origin, and Fabrication of Life". Columbia University Press, New York&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theoretical Biology Club===

In the early 1930s [[Joseph Henry Woodger]] and [[Joseph Needham]], together with [[C. H. Waddington|Conrad Hal Waddington]], [[John Desmond Bernal]], Dorothy Needham, and [[Dorothy Wrinch]], formed the [[Theoretical Biology Club]], to promote the organicist approach to [[biology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Life Organic|last=Peterson|first=Erik|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|year=2017|isbn=9780822944669|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club was in opposition to [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanism]], [[reductionism]] and the [[gene-centric view of evolution]]. Most of the members were influenced by the philosophy of [[Alfred North Whitehead]].&lt;ref&gt;Reconciling science and religion: the debate in early-twentieth-century Britain, 2001, Peter J. Bowler&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A history of molecular biology, Michel Morange, Matthew Cobb, 2000, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge scientific minds, Peter Michael Harman, Simon Mitton, 2002, p. 302&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greater than the parts: holism in biomedicine, 1920–1950, Christopher Lawrence, George Weisz, Oxford University Press, 1998, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; The club disbanded as the Rockefeller Foundation refused to fund their investigations.&lt;ref&gt;The future of DNA, Johannes Wirz, Edith T.

[[Image:Old Farmer's Almanac 1793 cover.jpg|frame|''[[The Old Farmer's Almanac]]'' is famous in the US for its (not necessarily accurate) long-range weather predictions.]]

A '''prediction''' ([[Latin]] ''præ-'', "before," and ''dicere'', "to say"), or '''[[forecasting|forecast]]''', is a statement about a future [[event (probability theory)|event]]&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Wisdom and foresight in Chinese thought: sensing the immediate future. Journal of Futures Studies. 22(3), pp. 35-50. https://doi.org/10.6531/JFS.2018.22(3).00A35&lt;/ref&gt;. A prediction is often, but not always, based upon experience or knowledge. There is no universal agreement about the exact difference between the two terms; different authors and disciplines ascribe different [[connotation]]s. (Contrast with [[estimation]].)

Although future events are necessarily [[uncertainty|uncertain]], so guaranteed accurate information about the future is in many cases impossible, prediction can be useful to assist in making [[planning|plans]] about possible developments; Howard H. Stevenson writes that prediction in business "...  is at least two things: Important and hard."&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, Howard, ed. ''Do lunch or be lunch''. Boston: [[Harvard Business School Press]], 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judgement-based prediction==
In a non-statistical sense, the term "prediction" is often used to refer to an [[hypothesis|informed guess or opinion]]&lt;ref&gt;Grunwald, A., 2014. Modes of orientation provided by futures studies: making sense of diversity and divergence. European Journal of Futures Research, 2(1), p.30.&lt;/ref&gt;.

A prediction of this kind might be informed by a predicting person's [[abductive reasoning]], [[inductive reasoning]], [[deductive reasoning]], and [[empirical evidence|experience]]; and may be of useful — if the predicting person is a [[expert|knowledgeable person]] in the field.&lt;ref&gt;Silver, Nate (2012) The signal and the noise: Why so many predictions fail--but some don't. The Penguin Press, New York, 534 p. {{ISBN|978-1-59420-411-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Delphi method]] is a technique for eliciting such expert-judgement-based predictions in a controlled way.  This type of prediction might be perceived as consistent with statistical techniques in the sense that, at minimum, the "data" being used is the predicting expert's [[Cognition|cognitive experiences]] forming an [[intuition|intuitive]] [[Probability density function|"probability curve."]]

==Statistics==
In [[statistics]], prediction is a part of [[statistical inference]]. One particular approach to such inference is known as [[predictive inference]], but the prediction can be undertaken within any of the several approaches to statistical inference. Indeed, one possible description of statistics is that it provides a means of transferring knowledge about a sample of a population to the whole population, and to other related populations, which is not necessarily the same as prediction over time. When information is transferred across time, often to specific points in time, the process is known as [[forecasting]].&lt;ref&gt;Cox, D. R. (2006). Principles of Statistical Inference, Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-521-68567-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=November 2017|reason=Reference does not mention "forecasting" at all.}} Forecasting usually requires [[time series]] methods, while prediction is often performed on [[cross-sectional data]].

Statistical techniques used for prediction include [[regression analysis]] and its various sub-categories such as [[linear regression]], [[generalized linear model]]s ([[logistic regression]], [[Poisson regression]], [[Probit regression]]), etc. In case of forecasting, [[autoregressive moving average model]]s and [[vector autoregression]] models can be utilized. When these and/or related, generalized set of regression or [[machine learning]] methods are deployed in commercial usage, the field is known as [[predictive analytics]].&lt;ref&gt;Siegel, Eric (2013). Predictive analysis: The power to predict who will click, buy, lie, or die. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Hoboken, NJ, 302 p. {{ISBN|978-1-118-35685-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In many applications, such as time series analysis, it is possible to estimate the models that generate the observations. If models can be expressed as transfer functions or in terms of state-space parameters then smoothed, filtered and predicted data estimates can be calculated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Einicke, G.A.

 | url = http://www.intechopen.com/books/smoothing-filtering-and-prediction-estimating-the-past-present-and-future}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the underlying generating models are linear then a minimum-variance [[Kalman filter]] and a minimum-variance smoother may be used to recover data of interest from noisy measurements. These techniques rely on one-step-ahead predictors (which minimise the variance of the prediction error). When the generating models are nonlinear then stepwise linearizations may be applied within [[Extended Kalman Filter]] and smoother recursions. However, in nonlinear cases, optimum minimum-variance performance guarantees no longer apply.&lt;ref&gt;Julier, S.J., Uhlmann, J.K. (2004). Unscented filtering and nonlinear estimation. Proceedings of the IEEE, 92(3), 401–422. doi =  10.1109/jproc.2003.823141. http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=1271397.&lt;/ref&gt;

To use regression analysis for prediction, data are collected on the variable that is to be predicted, called the [[dependent variable]] or response variable, and on one or more variables whose values are [[hypothesis|hypothesized]] to influence it, called [[independent variable]]s or explanatory variables. A [[Function (mathematics)#Real-valued functions|functional form]], often linear, is hypothesized for the postulated causal relationship, and the [[parameter]]s of the function are [[estimation|estimated]] from the data—that is, are chosen so as to optimize is some way the [[goodness of fit|fit]] of the function, thus parameterized, to the data. That is the estimation step. For the prediction step, explanatory variable values that are deemed relevant to future (or current but not yet observed) values of the dependent variable are input to the parameterized function to generate predictions for the dependent variable.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, John (2016) Applied regression analysis and generalized linear models.

In science, a prediction is a rigorous, often quantitative, statement, forecasting what would happen under specific conditions; for example, if an apple fell from a tree it would be attracted towards the center of the earth by [[gravity]] with a specified and constant [[acceleration]]. The [[scientific method]] is built on testing statements that are [[logical consequence]]s of scientific theories. This is done through repeatable [[experiment]]s or observational studies.

A [[scientific theory]] which is contradicted by observations and evidence will be rejected. New theories that generate many new predictions can more easily be supported or [[falsifiability|falsified]] (see [[predictive power]]). Notions that make no ''testable'' predictions are usually &lt;!--only usually; string theory is considered science though no predictions can be tested--&gt;considered not to be part of science ([[protoscience]] or nescience) until testable predictions can be made.

[[Mathematical equation]]s and [[Mathematical model|models]], and [[computer model]]s, are frequently used to describe the past and future behaviour of a process within the boundaries of that model. In some cases the [[probability]] of an outcome, rather than a specific outcome, can be predicted, for example in much of [[quantum physics]].

In [[microprocessor]]s, [[Branch predictor|branch prediction]] permits avoidance of [[Pipeline (computing)|pipeline]] emptying at [[Branch (computer science)|branch instructions]]. In [[engineering]], possible failure modes are predicted and avoided by correcting the mechanism causing the failure.

Accurate prediction and forecasting are very difficult in some areas, such as [[natural disasters]], [[pandemics]], [[demography]], [[population dynamics]] and [[meteorology]]. For example, it is possible to predict the occurrence of [[solar cycle]]s, but their exact timing and magnitude is much more difficult (see picture to right).

===Scientific hypothesis and prediction===
Established science makes useful predictions which are often extremely reliable and accurate; for example, [[eclipse]]s are routinely predicted.

New theories make predictions which allow them to be disproved by reality. For example, predicting the structure of crystals at the atomic level is a current research challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author1=Woodley, S.M. |author2=Catlow, R. |year=2008 |title=Crystal structure prediction from first principles |journal=Nat Mater |volume=7 |issue=12 |pages=937–946 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nmat2321}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th century the scientific consensus was that there existed an absolute [[frame of reference]], which was given the name ''[[luminiferous ether]]''. The existence of this absolute frame was deemed necessary for consistency with the established idea that the speed of light is constant. The famous [[Michelson-Morley experiment]] demonstrated that predictions deduced from this concept were not borne out in reality, thus disproving the theory of an absolute frame of reference. The [[special theory of relativity]] was proposed by Einstein as an explanation for the seeming inconsistency between the constancy of the speed of light and the non-existence of a special, preferred or absolute frame of reference.

[[Albert Einstein]]'s theory of [[general relativity]] could not easily be tested as it did not produce any effects observable on a terrestrial scale. However, the theory predicted that large masses such as [[star]]s would bend light, in contradiction to accepted theory; this was observed in a 1919 eclipse.

==Finance==
[[File:Prediction market - example GUI - 2.gif|thumb|right|220px|[[Prediction market]]]]
Mathematical models of [[stock market]] behaviour (and economic behaviour in general) are also unreliable in predicting future behaviour. Among other reasons, this is because economic events may span several years, and the world is changing over a similar time frame, thus invalidating the relevance of past observations to the present. Thus there are an extremely small number (of the order of 1) of relevant past data points from which to project the future. In addition, it is generally believed that stock market prices already take into account all the information available to predict the future, and subsequent movements must therefore be the result of unforeseen events. Consequently, it is extremely difficult for a [[stock investor]] to [[Foresight (psychology)|anticipate]] or predict a [[stock market boom]], or a [[stock market crash]]. In contrast to predicting the actual stock return, forecasting of broad economic trends tends to have better accuracy. Such analysis is provided by both non-profit groups as well as by for-profit private institutions, including brokerage housesand consulting companies.

Some correlation has been seen between actual stock market movements and prediction data from large groups in surveys and prediction games.

An [[actuary]] uses [[actuarial science]] to assess and predict future business [[risk]], such that the risk(s) can be [[Emergency management|mitigated]]. For example, in [[insurance]] an actuary would use a [[Actuarial table|life table]] (which incorporates the historical experience of mortality rates and sometimes an estimate of future trends) to project [[life expectancy]].

==Sports==

Predicting the outcome of sporting events is a business which has grown in popularity in recent years.  Handicappers predict the outcome of games using a variety of mathematical formulas, simulation models or [[Qualitative research|qualitative analysis]].  Early, well known sports bettors, such as [[Jimmy the Greek]], were believed to have access to information that gave them an edge.  Information ranged from personal issues, such as gambling or drinking to undisclosed injuries; anything that may affect the performance of a player on the field.

Recent times have changed the way sports are predicted.  Predictions now typically consist of two distinct approaches: Situational plays and statistical based models.  Situational plays are much more difficult to measure because they usually involve the motivation of a team.  Dan Gordon, noted handicapper, wrote “Without an emotional edge in a game in addition to value in a line, I won’t put my money on it”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Gordon, Dan

 | isbn = 978-1-5804-2174-4
 | url = http://cardozabooks.com/BEAT-THE-SPORTS-BOOKS.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These types of plays consist of: Betting on the home underdog, betting against Monday Night winners if they are a favorite next week, betting the underdog in “look ahead” games etc.  As situational plays become more widely known they become less useful because they will impact the way the line is set.

The widespread use of technology has brought with it more modern [[sports betting systems]].  These systems are typically algorithms and simulation models based on [[regression analysis]]. [[Jeff Sagarin]], a sports statistician, has brought attention to sports by having the results of his models published in USA Today.  He is currently paid as a consultant by the [[Dallas Mavericks]] for his advice on lineups and the use of his Winval system, which evaluates free agents. [[Advanced NFL Stats|Brian Burke]], a former [[Navy]] fighter pilot turned sports statistician, has published his results of using regression analysis to predict the outcome of NFL games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Burke, Brian

His website includes his College Basketball Ratings, a tempo based statistics system.  Some statisticians have become very famous for having successful prediction systems.  Dare wrote “the effective odds for sports betting and horse racing are a direct result of human decisions and can therefore potentially exhibit consistent error”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Dare, William H

==Opinion polls==
[[File:2004 canadian election approval ratings June 2.png|thumb|right|180px|[[Approval rating]]s (percentages) for the 2004 Canadian federal election]]

In [[politics]] it is common to attempt to predict the outcome of [[elections]] via [[political forecasting]] techniques (or assess the popularity of [[politicians]]) through the use of [[opinion polls]]. [[Prediction games]] have been used by many corporations and governments to learn about the most likely outcome of future events.

==Supernatural prediction==
{{Main|Prophecy}}

Predictions have often been made, from antiquity until the present, by using [[paranormal]] or [[supernatural]] means such as [[prophecy]] or by observing [[omen]]s. Methods including [[water divining]], [[astrology]], [[numerology]], [[fortune telling]], [[Oneiromancy|interpretation of dreams]], and many other forms of [[divination]], have been used for millennia to attempt to predict the future. These means of prediction have not been proven by scientific experiments.

In literature, vision and prophecy are literary devices used to present a possible timeline of future events.  They can be distinguished by vision referring to what an individual sees happen. The [[New Testament]] book of [[Revelation|Revelation (Bible)]] thus uses vision as a literary device in this regard. It is also prophecy or prophetic literature when it is related by an individual in a [[sermon]] or other public forum.

[[Divination]] is the attempt to gain insight into a question or situation by way of an occultic standardized process or ritual.&lt;ref&gt;Peek, P.M. ''African Divination Systems: Ways of Knowing.'' page 2. Indiana University Press. 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; It is an integral part of witchcraft and has been used in various forms for thousands of years. Diviners ascertain their interpretations of how a [[querent]] should proceed by reading signs, events, or [[omen]]s, or through alleged contact with a [[supernatural]] agency, most often describe as an angel or a god though viewed by Christians and Jews as a fallen angel or demon.&lt;ref name="merriamw"&gt;[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/divination ''Definition of divination'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prediction in fiction==
Fiction (especially fantasy, [[future history|forecasting]] and science fiction) often features instances of prediction achieved by unconventional means.
* In fantasy literature, predictions are often obtained through [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] or [[prophecy]], sometimes referring back to old traditions. For example, in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', many of the characters possess an awareness of events extending into the future, sometimes as prophecies, sometimes as more-or-less vague 'feelings'. The character [[Galadriel]], in addition, employs a water "mirror" to show images, sometimes of possible future events.
* In some of [[Philip K. Dick]]'s stories, mutant humans called ''precogs'' can foresee the future (ranging from days to years). In the story called ''The Golden Man'', an exceptional mutant can predict the future to an indefinite range (presumably up to his death), and thus becomes completely non-human, an animal that follows the predicted paths automatically. Precogs also play an essential role in another of Dick's stories, ''[[The Minority Report]]'', which was turned into a [[Minority Report (film)|film]] by [[Steven Spielberg]] in 2002.
* In the ''[[Foundation series|Foundation]]'' series by [[Isaac Asimov]], a mathematician finds out that historical events (up to some detail) can be theoretically modelled using equations, and then spends years trying to put the theory in practice. The new science of [[Psychohistory (fictional)|psychohistory]] founded upon his success can simulate history and extrapolate the present into the future.
* In [[Frank Herbert]]'s sequels to 1965's ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', his characters are dealing with the repercussions of being able to see the possible futures and select amongst them. Herbert sees this as a trap of stagnation, and his characters follow a so-called "[[Golden Path (Dune)|Golden Path]]" out of the trap.
* In [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]'s ''[[The Left Hand of Darkness]]'', the humanoid inhabitants of planet Gethen have mastered the art of prophecy and routinely produce data on past, present or future events on request. In this story, this was a minor plot device.

'''Quasi-empirical methods''' are [[methodology|methods]] applied in [[science]] and [[mathematics]] to achieve [[epistemology]] similar to that of [[empiricism]] (thus ''[[wikt:quasi-#Prefix|quasi-]] + empirical'') when [[experience]] cannot [[falsifiability|falsify]] the ideas involved. [[Empirical research]] relies on [[empirical evidence]], and its empirical methods involve [[experiment]]ation and disclosure of apparatus for [[reproducibility]], by which scientific findings are [[verification and validation|validated]] by other scientists. Empirical methods are studied extensively in the [[philosophy of science]], but they cannot be used directly in fields whose hypotheses cannot be falsified by real experiment (for example, [[mathematics]], [[philosophy]], [[theology]], and [[ideology]]). Because of such [[empirical limits in science]], the [[scientific method]] must rely not only on empirical methods but sometimes also on quasi-empirical ones. The prefix ''[[wikt:quasi-#Prefix|quasi-]]'' came to denote methods that are "almost" or "socially approximate" an ideal of truly empirical methods.

It is unnecessary to find all counterexamples to a theory; all that is required to disprove a theory logically is one counterexample. The converse does not prove a theory; [[Bayesian inference]] simply makes a theory more likely, by weight of evidence.

One can argue that no science is capable of finding all counter-examples to a theory, therefore, no science is strictly empirical, it's all quasi-empirical. But usually, the term "quasi-empirical" refers to the means of choosing problems to focus on (or ignore), selecting prior work on which to build an argument or proof, notations for informal claims, peer review and acceptance, and incentives to discover, ignore, or correct errors.  These are common to both [[science]] and [[mathematics]], and do not include experimental method.

[[Albert Einstein]]'s discovery of the [[general relativity]] theory relied upon [[thought experiments]] and [[mathematics]]. Empirical methods only became relevant when confirmation was sought. Furthermore, some empirical confirmation was found only some time after the general acceptance of the theory.

Thought experiments are almost standard procedure in [[philosophy]], where a conjecture is tested out in the imagination for possible effects on experience; when these are thought to be implausible,  unlikely to occur, or not actually occurring, then the conjecture may be either rejected or amended.  [[Logical positivism]] was a perhaps extreme version of this practice, though this claim is open to debate.

Post-20th-century [[philosophy of mathematics]] is mostly concerned with [[quasi-empiricism in mathematics|quasi-empirical mathematical methods]], especially as reflected in the actual [[mathematical practice]] of working mathematicians.

The '''Regius Professor of Natural History''' is a [[Regius Professor]]ship at the [[University of Aberdeen]] in Scotland. It was originally called the Regius Professor of Civil and Natural History at [[Marischal College]] until in 1860 [[Marischal College]] and [[King's College, Aberdeen|King's College]]s merged to form the University of Aberdeen, and the title changed to Natural History.

'''"Scientific Integrity in Policymaking: An Investigation into the Bush Administration's Misuse of Science"''' is the title of a report published by the [[Union of Concerned Scientists]] in February, 2004. The report was the culmination of an investigation of the [[George W. Bush|Bush administration]]'s objectivity in [[science]], and ultimately a [[critic]]ism thereof.&lt;ref name="UCS2004"&gt;{{cite web|title=Scientific Integrity in Policy Making (2004)|url=http://www.ucsusa.org/our-work/center-science-and-democracy/promoting-scientific-integrity/reports-scientific-integrity.html|website=Union of Concerned Scientists|accessdate=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (After it was published, the report's existence was fairly well-publicized by the [[United States]]' [[mass media]].)

== "Suppression and distortion of research findings" ==
[[File:Condoleezza_Rice_Colin_Powell_George_W._Bush_Donald_Rumsfeld.jpg|thumb|200px|Rice, Powell, Bush, and Rumsfeld]]
A central thesis of the report, according to the Executive Summary (on page 2 of the text), was that the Bush administration had behaved in ways considered to be consistent with the following three situations.

# Epidemic altering and concealing of scientific [[information]] by senior officials in various federal [[Government agency|agencies]]
# Active censorship of scientific information that the administration considered threatening to its own [[Philosophy|philosophies]]
# Restriction of the ability of government-supported scientists to freely communicate scientific [[idea]]s related to "sensitive" issues

== "An unprecedented pattern of behavior" ==

In "Part III", the text of the report posits that the aforementioned activities are unprecedented in the [[history of the United States]]. The report lists the following persons and organization who had supposedly acted or made statements to support this claim.

''This list is sorted first by category, then by the order in which the persons or organizations are mentioned in the report.''

* Organization
** [[REP America]]
* Persons
** [[William Ruckelshaus|Ruckelshaus, William]]
** [[Russell Train|Train, Russell]]
** [[Wolfgang Panofsky|Panofsky, Dr. Wolfgang H. K.]]
** [[Marvin Leonard Goldberger|Goldberger, Dr. Marvin]]
** [[Margaret Scarlett|Scarlett, Dr. Margaret]]
** [[Donald Kennedy|Kennedy, Donald]]
** [[D. Allan Bromley|Bromley, Dr. D. Allan]]
** [[Lewis M. Branscomb|Branscomb, Professor Lewis M.]]
** [[Lynn Goldman|Goldman, Dr. Lynn]]

== Recommendations by the Union ==

Page 29 of the report states: "This behavior by the administration violates the central premise of the [[scientific method]], and is therefore of particularly grave concern to the scientific community." It then goes on, in a short section titled "Conclusions and Recommendations: What's at Stake" at the end of the report, to provide recommendations for "restoring scientific integrity to federal policymaking" (page 30). These recommendations (on pages 30–31) include a suggestion for the [[President of the United States]] to issue [[Executive order (United States)|executive order]]s, and other actions, that would prevent further "abuse"; for the [[United States Congress]] to hold appropriate [[Hearing (law)|hearing]]s, consider the consequences of [[statutory law]] under its influence, increase the amount of publicly available scientific information, and establish an organization to guide Congress in its deliberations in technical matters; for scientists to raise awareness of the aforementioned issues and provide public policy recommendations; for the public to exercise its political influence in a constructive manner.

== Response ==
On April 2, 2004, the [[White House Office of Science and Technology Policy]] issued a statement by [[John Marburger|Dr. John Marburger]], the director of OSTP, that claims the descriptions of the incidents in the UCS report are all "false," "wrong," or "a distortion." He said he was disappointed with the report and dismissed it as "biased."[https://www.wired.com/news/medtech/0,1286,62339,00.html].

'''Social studies of finance''' is an interdisciplinary research area that combines perspectives from [[anthropology]], [[economic sociology]], [[science and technology studies]], [[international political economy]], [[behavioral finance]], [[cultural studies]] and/or [[economics]] in the study of [[financial markets]]. Work in social studies of finance emphasises the social and cultural dimensions of financial activities, but focuses also on technical and economic dimensions such as pricing and trading.

==History==
Financial markets have been an object for sociological inquiry since, at least, [[Max Weber]]’s ''[[Die Börse]]''. The raise of quantitative financial theory in [[financial economics]] from the 1950s onwards has led to an academic specialization on financial markets rather focused on economic modeling, and poorly attentive to sociological aspects. In the 1980s, a number of economic sociologists developed empirical investigation on the social structure and cultural characteristics of financial markets, especially in the US. Such pioneering researcher included contributions from Wayne E. Baker, Mitchel Y. Abolafia and Charles W. Smith, and was based on methods such as ethnographic observation or [[social network analysis]]. In the 1990s, a number of researchers from the field of [[science and technology studies]] such as [[Karin Knorr-Cetina]] and [[Donald Angus MacKenzie|Donald A. MacKenzie]] started also developing empirical research in this area, with close attention to the role of expert knowledge and technology in financial activities.

==Main topics==
Research topics in social studies of finance include the cultural world and work habits of [[Trader (finance)|traders]] and other professionals in financial markets, the [[globalization]] and [[regulation]] of financial services, the processes of [[innovation]] in the financial industry and the problems of [[risk]] and [[uncertainty]] that characterize such processes.

'''''The Hunting Hypothesis: A Personal Conclusion Concerning the Evolutionary Nature of Man''''' (commonly known as ''The Hunting Hypothesis'') is a 1976 work of paleoanthropology by [[Robert Ardrey]]. It is the final book in his widely read [[Nature of Man Series]], which also includes ''[[African Genesis]]'' (1961) and ''[[The Territorial Imperative]]'' (1966).

The work deals with the ramifications of evolutionarily inherited traits in man, particularly those that developed through hunting. It was also one of the earliest books to warn about the possible dangers of climate change.

==Theories and controversy==
Ardrey's main focus in ''The Hunting Hypothesis'' was to examine the ways in which human evolution developed with and because of hunting behavior, and the effects on modern man of inherited traits related to this evolution.&lt;ref name=HH&gt;Ardrey, Robert. "The Hunting Hypothesis: A Personal Conclusion Concerning the Evolutionary Nature of Man." 1976. New York: Atheneum. 231 pp. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Turnbull" /&gt;

At the time of the publication of ''The Hunting Hypothesis'' there was still significant controversy surrounding the thesis that early man hunted for food. Ardrey's work was often attacked for its focus on human aggression. In particular, [[Ashley Montagu]], representing a camp known as the "Blank State" theorists, who believed that man's behavior was entirely socially determined, marshaled fourteen scientists to refute Ardrey and his predecessors (chiefly [[Konrad Lorenz]]) in two volumes.&lt;ref&gt;La Barre, Weston. Book Review on "Man and Aggression" accessible [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1525/aa.1969.71.5.02a00150/asset/aa.1969.71.5.02a00150.pdf;jsessionid=C4DD68B227D90FA5F78530709F284286.f01t03?v=1&amp;t=iaqrmrl2&amp;s=59ace8b7889c08d3b2d2ec44bfcdcdb3ea23ee93 here].&lt;/ref&gt;

Though now generally accepted,&lt;ref name=Wong /&gt; the hypothesis that hunting behavior influenced the evolution of early man continued to inspire controversy. As late as 1997 [[PBS]], in its series ''In Search of Human Origins'' cast aspersion on the notion that hunting was common in early man, asserting instead that early man was primarily a "highly successful scavenger."&lt;ref&gt;"In Search of Human Origins Part Two." ''NOVA.'' Public Broadcasting Corporation. 10 June 1997. Transcript available [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/transcripts/2107hum2.html here].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Today, the theories propounded in ''The Hunting Hypothesis'' have come to be commonly accepted in the scientific community. In 2011 PBS reversed its earlier position. The special ''Becoming Human'' asserted:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Homo erectus probably hunted with close-quarters weapons, with spears that were thrown at animals from a short distance, clubs, thrown rocks, weapons like that. They weren’t using long distance projectile weapons that we know of. The Homo erectus hunt was simple but effective. It fed not just their larger brains, but the growing complexity of that early human society.&lt;ref&gt;"Becoming Human Part 2." ''NOVA.'' Public Broadcasting Corporation. 31, August, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''[[Scientific American]]'' wrote about the controversy:
&lt;blockquote&gt;For decades researchers have been locked in debate over how and when hunting began and how big a role it played in human evolution.  Recent analyses of human anatomy, stone tools and animal bones are helping to fill in the details of this game-changing shift in subsistence strategy.  This evidence indicates that hunting evolved far earlier than some scholars had envisioned – and profoundly impacted subsequent human evolution.&lt;ref name=Wong &gt;Wong, Kate. "How Hunting Made Us Human." ''Scientific American,'' Volume 310, Issue 4. Print. Retrievable [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-hunting-made-us-human/ here].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Reception==

Reviews of ''The Hunting Hypothesis'' were mixed; popular reviews tended to be generally positive, and scientific reviews tended to be polarized.{{elucidate|date=July 2015|reason=negative reviews need discussion}}

The famed biologist and naturalist [[E. O. Wilson]], who notably advocated for Ardrey against his critics, effusively praised the book.
&lt;blockquote&gt;In his excellent new book Robert Ardrey continues as the lyric poet of human evolution, capturing the Homeric quality of the subject that so many scientists by and large feel but are unable to put into words. His opinions, like those in his earlier works, are controversial but more open, squarely stated, and closer to the truth than the protests of his most scandalized critics.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Edward O. Quoted in "Professional Comments on Robert Ardrey's ''The Hunting Hypothesis.''" Available through Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center, Boston University.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The anthropologist [[Colin Turnbull]] reviewed the book for ''[[The New York Times]]'': "This is a sober, well-reasoned plea for a sane appraisal of the human situation, of a re-evaluation of man's nature, of where he has come from and, much more important, where he is going."&lt;ref name=Turnbull&gt;Turnbull, Colin M. "Just out of the Jungle: Hunting Hypothesis." ''The New York Times,'' 23 May 1976. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to call it a profoundly hopeful book, dispelling notions that Ardrey's work was pessimistic. "If there is any cause for pessimism it is not in the facts nor in Ardrey's account, but in man's demonstrated ability to ignore the lessons of history, and in his preference for short-term responses rather than long-term solutions."&lt;ref name=Turnbull /&gt;

''The Hunting Hypothesis'', which was the final book in Ardrey's ''Nature of Man'' series, was widely acknowledged as a fitting capstone to his work. [[Max Lerner]], for instance, wrote that it was "Easily the best of Robert Ardrey's books. It is brilliant in its summary of recent findings, it is wonderfully persuasive in its argument about our essential human nature, and it makes a satisfying unity out of Ardrey's thinking in all his books."&lt;ref&gt;Lerner, Max. Quoted in "Professional Comments on Robert Ardrey's ''The Hunting Hypothesis.''" Available through Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center, Boston University.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Masters|Roger D. Masters]] wrote that "''The Hunting Hypothesis'' is probably Robert Ardrey's best book. ... His overall contribution to public understanding of an enormous range of scientific research is of the greatest importance."&lt;ref&gt;Masters, Roger D. Quoted in "Professional Comments on Robert Ardrey's ''The Hunting Hypothesis.''" Available through Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center, Boston University.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Antony Jay]] summarized the consensus:
&lt;blockquote&gt;If I believe that Robert Ardrey's books are the most important to be written since the war and arguably in the 20th century, it is because he has satisfied to a quite unbelievable degree the demands of the ignorant layman and the requirements of the responsible scientist. ''The Hunting Hypothesis'' is not so much a sequel to the three previous books as the culmination of them. He draws on twenty years of wide reading and deep thinking, of predictable objection and surprising corroboration, to produce a unique and beautiful account of the making of man.&lt;ref&gt;Jay, Antony. Quoted in "Professional Comments on Robert Ardrey's ''The Hunting Hypothesis.''" Available through Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center, Boston University.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''The Hunting Hypothesis'' found success with popular audiences, though it sold fewer copies than ''[[African Genesis]]'' or ''[[The Territorial Imperative]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Dawkins, Richard. ''Appetite for Wonder: The Making of a Scientist.'' 2014. New York: Ecco. Print&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 it was reissued in a new edition.&lt;ref&gt;Ardrey, Robert. "The Hunting Hypothesis: A Personal Conclusion Concerning the Evolutionary Nature of Man." StoryDesign LTD. 12 September 2014. E-book. [https://www.amazon.com/The-Hunting-Hypothesis-Conclusion-Evolutionary/dp/0988604388 Amazon.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate change==
''The Hunting Hypothesis'' was also one of the first books to warn about the possible dangers of climate change for the continued existence of humanity.&lt;ref name=Turnbull&gt;Turnbull, Colin M. "Just out of the Jungle: Hunting Hypothesis." ''The New York Times,'' 23 May 1976. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Ardrey argued that the changing climate could render inoperable vast swathes of wheat-producing land in the Northern [[United States]], [[Canada]] and [[Russia]].&lt;ref name=HH /&gt; He advocated long-term action and respect for nature. "One of Ardrey's major criticisms of modern man is precisely that since the inception of agriculture he has sought to dominate nature, separating himself from it until he is now coming to think of himself as nature's master."&lt;ref name=Turnbull /&gt;

{{Descartes}}

'''''The World''''', also called '''''Treatise on the Light''''' ([[French language|French]] title: ''Traité du monde et de la lumière''), is a book by [[René Descartes]] (1596&amp;ndash;1650). Written between 1629 and 1633, it contains a nearly complete version of his [[philosophy]], from method, to [[metaphysics]], to [[physics]] and [[biology]].

Descartes espoused [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanical philosophy]], a form of [[natural philosophy]] popular in the 17th century. He thought everything physical in the universe to be made of tiny "corpuscles" of matter. [[Corpuscularianism]] is closely related to [[atomism]]. The main difference was that Descartes maintained that there could be no [[Vacuum#Historical interpretation|vacuum]], and all matter was constantly swirling to prevent a void as corpuscles moved through other matter. ''The World'' presents a corpuscularian cosmology in which swirling vortices explain, among other phenomena, the creation of the [[Solar System]] and the circular motion of planets around the [[Sun]].

''The World'' rests on the [[heliocentric]] view, first explicated in Western Europe by [[Copernicus]].  Descartes delayed the book's release upon news of the [[Roman Inquisition]]'s conviction of [[Galileo]] for "suspicion of heresy" and sentencing to house arrest.  Descartes discussed his work on the book, and his decision not to release it, in letters with another philosopher, [[Marin Mersenne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gaukroger|first=Stephen|title=Descartes an intellectual biography|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0198237243|edition=Repr., paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some material from ''The World'' was revised for publication as ''Principia philosophiae'' or ''[[Principles of Philosophy]]'' (1644), a Latin textbook at first intended by Descartes to replace the Aristotelian textbooks then used in universities. In the ''Principles'' the heliocentric tone was softened slightly with a relativist frame of reference. The last chapter of ''The World'' was published separately as ''De Homine'' (''On Man'') in 1662. The rest of ''The World'' was finally published in 1664, and the entire text in 1677.

== The void and particles in nature ==
Before Descartes begins to describe his theories in physics, he introduces the reader to the idea that there is no relationship between our sensations and what creates these sensations, thereby casting doubt on the Aristotelian belief that such a relationship existed.  Next he describes how fire is capable of breaking wood apart into its minuscule parts through the rapid motion of the particles of fire within the flames.  This rapid motion of particles is what gives fire its heat, since Descartes claims heat is nothing more than just the motion of particles, and what causes it to produce light.

According to Descartes, the motion, or agitation, of these particles is what gives substances their properties (i.e. their fluidity and hardness).  Fire is the most fluid and has enough energy to render most other bodies fluid whereas the particles of air lack the force necessary to do the same.  Hard bodies have particles that are all equally hard to separate from the whole.

Based on his observations of how resistant nature is to a vacuum, Descartes deduced that all particles in nature are packed together such that there is no void or empty space in nature (however, Descartes makes it clear that he does not claim that a void cannot exist in nature, since he lacks the observations necessary to say this with certainty).

Descartes describes substances as consisting only of three elementary elements: fire, air and earth, from which the properties of any substance can be characterized by its composition of these elements, the size and arrangement of the particles in the substance, and the motion of its particles.

== Cartesian laws of motion ==

The motion of these particles and all other objects in nature are subject to the laws of motion Descartes had observed:

# “…each particular part of matter always continues in the same state unless collision with others forces it to change its state.”
# “…when one of these bodies pushes another, it cannot give the 2nd any motion, except by losing as much of its own motion at the same time…”
#  “…when a body is moving…each of its parts individually tends always to continue moving along a straight line” (Gaukroger)

Descartes in ''[[Principles of Philosophy]]'' added to these his laws on [[elastic collision]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel Garber|title=The Cambridge history of seventeenth-century philosophy: Volume I|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BPlkkgIhUXIC&amp;pg=PA688|accessdate=27 April 2013|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-53720-9|page=688}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Cartesian universe ==

Descartes elaborates on how the universe could have started from utter chaos and with these basic laws could have had its particles arranged so as to resemble the universe we observe today.  Once the particles in the chaotic universe began to move, the overall motion would have been circular because there is no void in nature, so whenever a single particle moves, another particle must also move to occupy the space where the previous particle once was.  This type of circular motion, or vortex, would have created what Descartes observed to be the orbits of the planets about the sun with the heavier objects spinning out towards the outside of the vortex and the lighter objects remaining closer to the center.  To explain this, Descartes used the analogy of a river that carried both floating debris (leaves, feathers, etc.) and heavy boats.  If the river abruptly arrived at a sharp bend, the boats would follow Descartes third law of motion and hit the shore of the river since the flow of the particles in the river would not have enough force to change the direction of the boat.  However, the much lighter floating debris would follow the river since the particles in the river would have sufficient force to change the direction of the debris.  In the heavens, it’s the circular flow of celestial particles, or aether, that causes the motion of the planets to be circular.

As to the reason why heavy objects on Earth fall, Descartes explained this through the agitation of the particles in the atmosphere.  The particles of the aether have greater agitation than the particles of air, which in turn have greater agitation than the particles that compose terrestrial objects (e.g. stones).  The greater agitation of the aether prevents the particles of air from escaping into the heavens, just as the agitation of air particles forces terrestrial bodies, whose particles have far less agitation than those of air, to descend towards the world.

== Cartesian theory on light ==

With his laws of motion set forth and the universe operating under these laws, Descartes next begins to describe his theory on the nature of light.  Descartes believed that light traveled instantaneously - a common belief at the time – as an impulse across all the adjacent particles in nature, since Descartes believed nature was without a void.  To illustrate this, Descartes used the example of a stick being pushed against some body.  Just as the force which is felt at one end of the stick is instantly transferred and felt at the other end, so is the impulse of light that is sent across the heavens and through the atmosphere from luminous bodies to our eyes.  Descartes attributed light to have 12 distinct properties:

#Light extends circularly in all direction from luminous bodies	
#Light extends out to any distance
#Light travels instantaneously
#Light travels ordinarily in straight lines or rays
#Several rays can come from different points and meet at the same point
#Several rays can start at the same point and travel in different directions
#Several rays can pass through the same point without impeding each other
#If the rays are of very unequal force, then they can sometimes impede one another

Also:
* 9) and 10) Rays can be diverted by reflection or by refraction
* 11) and 12) The force of a ray can be augmented or diminished by the disposition of the matter that receives it.

{{Platonism}}

The &lt;!-- "theory" lowercase as in all other theories--&gt;'''theory of Forms''' or '''theory of Ideas'''&lt;ref&gt;Modern English textbooks and translations prefer "theory of Form" to "theory of Ideas", but the latter has a long and respect tradition starting with Cicero and continuing in German philosophy until present, and some English philosophers prefer this in English too.  See W. D. Ross, Plato's ''Theory of Ideas'' (1951).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!-- This quote has to be checked including the erroneous volume no. (there are only 2), the missing page number, and the uppercase "theory"--&gt; The name of this aspect of Plato's thought is not modern and has not been extracted from certain dialogues by modern scholars. However, it is attributed to Plato without any direct textual evidence that Plato himself holds the views of the speakers of the dialogues. The term was used at least as early as [[Diogenes Laertius]], who called it (Plato's) "Theory of Ideas:" {{lang|grc|Πλάτων ἐν τῇ περὶ τῶν ἰδεῶν ὑπολήψει}}..., {{cite encyclopedia | title=Plato | encyclopedia=Lives of Eminent Philosophers | volume=Book III | page=Paragraph 15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Plato uses many different words for what is traditionally called ''form'' in English translations and ''idea'' in German and Latin translations (Cicero). These include ''idéa'', ''morphē'', ''eîdos'', and ''parádeigma'', but also ''génos'', ''phýsis'', and ''[[Ousia|ousía]]''. He also uses expressions such as ''to x auto'', "the x itself" or ''kath' auto'' "in itself". See Christian Schäfer: ''Idee/Form/Gestalt/Wesen'', in ''Platon-Lexikon'', Darmstadt 2007, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; is a viewpoint attributed to [[Plato]], which holds that non-physical (but [[Ousia|substantial]]) forms (or ideas)&lt;!--not uppercase here because normal English words modified by the descriptive "abstract"--&gt; represent the most accurate reality.&lt;ref&gt;''Forms (usually given a capital F) were properties or essences of things, treated as non-material abstract, but substantial, entities. They were eternal, changeless, supremely real, and independent of ordinary objects that had their being and properties by 'participating' in them.''&lt;/ref&gt; When used in this sense, the word ''form''&lt;!-- but not the article--&gt; or ''idea'' is often capitalized.&lt;ref&gt;"Chapter 28: Form" of ''The Great Ideas: A Synopticon of Great Books of the Western World'' (Vol. II). Encyclopædia Britannica (1952), p. 526–542. This source states that ''Form'' or ''Idea'' get capitalized according to this convention when they refer "to that which is separate from the characteristics of material things and from the ideas in our mind."&lt;/ref&gt; Plato speaks of these entities only through the characters (primarily [[Socrates]]) of his dialogues who sometimes suggest that these Forms are the only objects of study that can provide knowledge. The theory itself is contested from within Plato's dialogues, and it is a general point of controversy in philosophy. Even whether the theory represents Plato's own views is held in doubt by modern scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | first=Stephen | last=Watt | contribution=Introduction: The Theory of Forms (Books 5-7) | title=Plato: Republic | year=1997 | pages=xiv–xvi | place=London | publisher=Wordsworth Editions | isbn=1-85326-483-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the theory is considered [[Platonic realism|a classical solution]] to the [[problem of universals]].

The early Greek concept of form precedes attested philosophical usage and is represented by a number of words mainly having to do with vision, sight, and appearance. 

==Forms&lt;!--linked from 'Third man argument'--&gt;==
The meaning of the term {{lang|grc|εἶδος}} (''eidos''), "visible form", and related terms μορφή (''morphē''), "shape",&lt;ref&gt;Possibly cognate with Sanskrit ''bráhman''. See Thieme (1952): ''Bráhman'', ZDMG, vol. 102, p. 128.{{cite web | title=ZDMG online | url=http://menadoc.bibliothek.uni-halle.de/dmg/periodical/titleinfo/93820}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and φαινόμενα (''phainomena''), "appearances", from φαίνω (''phainō''), "shine", [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European]] ''[[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/bʰeh₂-|''*bʰeh₂-'']]'' or ''*bhā-''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=*bhā- | work=American Heritage Dictionary: Fourth Edition: Appendix I | year=2000 | url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/roots/IE36.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; remained stable over the centuries until the beginning of philosophy, when they became equivocal, acquiring additional specialized philosophic meanings. The [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic philosophers]], starting with [[Thales]], noted that appearances change, and began to ask what the thing that changes "really" is. The answer was [[Substance theory|substance]], which stands under the changes and is the actually existing thing being seen. The status of appearances now came into question. What is the form really and how is that related to substance?

Thus, the theory of matter and form (today's [[hylomorphism]]) was born. Starting with at least Plato and possibly germinal in some of the presocratics the forms were considered as being "in" something else, which Plato called nature (''physis''). The latter seemed as carved "wood",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=H.G. |last=Liddell |first2=R. |last2=Scott |first3=J.M. |last3=Whiton |year=1891 |title=A Lexicon Abridged From Liddell &amp; Scott's Greek-English Lexicon |publisher=Harper |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nxoyBcpUuEsC&amp;pg=PA725 |page=725}}&lt;/ref&gt; ὕλη (''hyle'') in [[Greek language|Greek]], corresponding to ''materia'' in [[Latin]], from which the English word "[[Matter (philosophy)|matter]]" is derived,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=matter | work=American Heritage Dictionary: Fourth Edition | year=2000 | url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/51/M0155100.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; shaped by receiving (or exchanging) forms.

The Forms are expounded upon in Plato's dialogues and general speech, in that every object or quality in reality has a form: dogs, human beings, mountains, colors, courage, love, and goodness. Form answers the question, "What is that?" Plato was going a step further and asking what Form itself is. He supposed that the object was essentially or "really" the Form and that the phenomena were mere shadows mimicking the Form; that is, momentary portrayals of the Form under different circumstances. [[The problem of universals]] – how can one thing in general be many things in particular – was solved by presuming that Form was a distinct singular thing but caused plural representations of itself in particular objects. For example, [[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides]] states, "Nor, again, if a person were to show that all is one by partaking of one, and at the same time many by partaking of many, would that be very astonishing. But if he were to show me that the absolute one was many, or the absolute many one, I should be truly amazed."&lt;ref name="Parmenides"&gt;{{cite book | title=[[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p129}} Matter is considered particular in itself. For Plato, forms, such as beauty, are more real than any objects that imitate them. Though the forms are timeless and unchanging, physical things are in a constant change of existence. Where forms are unqualified perfection, physical things are qualified and conditioned.&lt;ref&gt;Kidder, D. S. and Oppenheim, N. D. (2006), The Intellectual Devotional, p27, Borders Group, Inc, Ann Arbor, {{ISBN|978-1-60961-205-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

These Forms are the essences of various objects: they are that without which a thing would not be the kind of thing it is. For example, there are countless tables in the world but the Form of tableness is at the core; it is the essence of all of them.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'' 389: "For neither does every smith, although he may be making the same instrument for the same purpose, make them all of the same iron. The form must be the same, but the material may vary ...."&lt;/ref&gt; Plato's Socrates held that the world of Forms is transcendent to our own world (the world of substances) and also is the essential basis of reality. Super-ordinate to matter, Forms are the most pure of all things. Furthermore, he believed that true knowledge/intelligence is the ability to grasp the world of Forms with one's mind.&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]'' 185d–e: "...the mind in itself is its own instrument for contemplating the common terms that apply to everything." "Common terms" here refers to ''existence, non-existence, likeness, unlikeness, sameness, difference, unity'' and ''number''.&lt;/ref&gt;

A Form is ''aspatial'' (transcendent to space) and ''atemporal'' (transcendent to time). Atemporal means that it does not exist within any time period, rather it provides the formal basis for time.  It therefore formally grounds beginning, persisting and ending. It is neither eternal in the sense of existing forever, nor mortal, of limited duration. It exists transcendent to time altogether.&lt;ref&gt;The creation of the universe is the creation of time: "For there were no days and nights and months and years ... but when he (God) constructed the heaven he created them also." — ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'', paragraph 37. For the creation God used "the pattern of the unchangeable," which is "that which is eternal." — paragraph 29. Therefore "eternal" – ''to aïdion'', "the everlasting" – as applied to Form means atemporal.&lt;/ref&gt; Forms are aspatial in that they have no spatial dimensions, and thus no orientation in space, nor do they even (like the point) have a location.&lt;ref&gt;Space answers to matter, the place-holder of form: "... and there is a third nature (besides Form and form), which is space (chōros), and is eternal (aei "always", certainly not atemporal), and admits not of destruction and provides a home for all created things ... we say of all existence that it must of necessity be in some place and occupy space ...." — ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'', paragraph 52. Some readers will have long since remembered that in Aristotle time and space are accidental forms. Plato does not make this distinction and concerns himself mainly with essential form. In Plato, if time and space were admitted to be form, time would be atemporal and space aspatial.&lt;/ref&gt; They are non-physical, but they are not in the mind. Forms are extra-mental (i.e. real in the strictest sense of the word).&lt;ref&gt;These terms produced with the English prefix a- are not ancient. For the usage refer to {{cite web | title=a- (2) | work=Online Etymology Dictionary | url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=a- }} They are however customary terms of modern metaphysics; for example, see {{cite book | first=Martha C. | last=Beck | title=Plato's Self-Corrective Development of the Concepts of Soul, Form and Immortality in Three Arguments of the Phaedo | publisher=Edwin Mellon Press | year=1999 | isbn=0-7734-7950-3 | page=148 }} and see {{cite book | first=Dr. Katherine | last=Hawley | title=How Things Persist | year=2001 | publisher=Clarendon Press | location=Oxford | isbn=0-19-924913-X | nopp=true | page=Chapter 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Form is an objective "blueprint" of perfection.&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' 28: "The work of the creator, whenever he looks to the unchangeable and fashions the form and nature of his work after an unchangeable pattern, must necessarily be made fair and perfect ...."&lt;/ref&gt;  The Forms are perfect themselves because they are unchanging.  For example, say we have a triangle drawn on a blackboard.  A triangle is a polygon with 3 sides.  The triangle as it is on the blackboard is far from perfect.  However, it is only the intelligibility of the Form "triangle" that allows us to know the drawing on the chalkboard is a triangle, and the Form "triangle" is perfect and unchanging. It is exactly the same whenever anyone chooses to consider it; however, the time is that of the observer and not of the triangle.

=== Etymology ===
The words, εἶδος (''eidos'') and ἰδέα (''idea'') come from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European]] root [[Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/weyd-|''*weyd-'']] or ''*weid-'' "see" (cognate with [[Sanskrit]] ''vétti''). ''Eidos'' (though not ''idea'') is already attested in texts of the [[Homer|Homeric]] era, the earliest Greek literature. This transliteration and the translation tradition of German and Latin lead to the expression "theory of Ideas." The word is however not the English "idea," which is a mental concept only.

===Terminology===
[[File:Allegory of the Cave blank.png|thumb|In the [[Allegory of the Cave]], the objects that are seen are not real, according to Plato, but literally mimic the real Forms.]]
The English word "form" may be used to translate two distinct concepts that concerned Plato—the outward "form" or appearance of something, and "Form" in a new, technical nature, that never&lt;blockquote&gt;...assumes a form  like that of any of the things which enter into her; ... But the forms which enter into and go out of her are the likenesses  of real existences modelled after their patterns in a wonderful and inexplicable manner....&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=aLnWAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA470 Plato's ''Republic'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The objects that are seen, according to [[Plato]], are not real, but literally ''mimic'' the real Forms. In the [[Allegory of the Cave]] expressed in ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'', the things that are ordinarily perceived in the world are characterized as shadows of the real things, which are not perceived directly. That which the observer understands when he views the world mimics the [[archetype]]s of the many [[type (metaphysics)|types]] and [[property (metaphysics)|properties]] (that is, of [[universal (metaphysics)|universals]]) of things observed.

===Intelligible realm and separation of the Forms===
Plato often invokes, particularly in his dialogues ''[[Phaedo]]'', ''Republic'' and ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'', poetic language to illustrate the mode in which the Forms are said to exist. Near the end of the ''Phaedo'', for example, Plato describes the world of Forms as a pristine region of the physical universe located above the surface of the Earth (''Phd.'' 109a-111c). In the ''Phaedrus'' the Forms are in a "place beyond heaven" (''huperouranios topos'') (''Phdr.'' 247c ff); and in the ''Republic'' the sensible world is contrasted with the intelligible realm (''noēton topon'') in the famous Allegory of the Cave.

It would be a mistake to take Plato's imagery as positing the intelligible world as a literal physical space apart from this one.&lt;ref&gt;"No sensible man would insist that these things are as I have described them..." (''Phd.'' 114d).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"there is no Platonic 'elsewhere', similar to the Christian 'elsewhere'." ([[Iris Murdoch]], "Metaphysics as a Guide to Morals" (London, Chatto &amp; Windus 1992)  399).&lt;/ref&gt;  Plato emphasizes that the Forms are not beings that extend in space (or time), but subsist apart from any physical space whatsoever.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plato-metaphysics/#3 Plato's Middle Period Metaphysics and Epistemology]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus we read in the ''Symposium'' of the Form of Beauty: "It is not anywhere in another thing, as in an animal, or in earth, or in heaven, or in anything else, but itself by itself with itself," (211b). And in the ''Timaeus'' Plato writes: "Since these things are so, we must agree that that which keeps its own form unchangingly, which has not been brought into being and is not destroyed, which neither receives into itself anything else from anywhere else, ''nor itself enters into anything anywhere'', is one thing," (52a, emphasis added).

===Ideal state===
{{original research|date=February 2016}}
According to Plato, Socrates postulated a world of ideal Forms, which he admitted were impossible to know. Nevertheless, he formulated a very specific description of that world, which did not match his metaphysical principles. Corresponding to the world of Forms is our world, that of the shadows, an imitation of the real one.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. the Analogy of the Cave, Rep. 514a–520a.&lt;/ref&gt; Just as shadows exist only because of the light of a fire, our world exists as, "the offspring of the good".&lt;ref&gt;Republic, 508b trans. Grube&lt;/ref&gt; Our world is modeled after the patterns of the Forms. The function of humans in our world is therefore to imitate the ideal world as much as possible which, importantly, includes imitating the good, i.e. acting morally.

Plato lays out much of this theory in the "Republic" where, in an  attempt to define Justice, he considers many topics including the constitution of the ideal state. While this state, and the Forms, do not exist on earth, because their imitations do, Plato says we are able to form certain well-founded opinions about them, through a theory called recollection.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Phaedo, Meno, Phaedrus&lt;/ref&gt;

The republic is a greater imitation of Justice:&lt;ref&gt;Paragraph 420.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Our aim in founding the state was not the disproportional happiness of any one class,&lt;ref&gt;The word is ''ethnos'', "people". For the full range of meanings consult the [[American Heritage Dictionary]] online under [http://www.bartleby.com/61/88/E0228800.html ethnic].&lt;/ref&gt; but the greatest happiness of the whole; we thought that in a state ordered with a view to the good of the whole we should be most likely to find justice.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The key to not know how such a state might come into existence is the word "founding" (''oikidzomen''), which is used of colonization.{{clarify|date=October 2012}} It was customary in such instances to receive a constitution from an elected or appointed lawgiver; however in Athens, lawgivers were appointed to reform the constitution from time to time (for example, [[Draco (lawgiver)|Draco]], [[Solon]]). In speaking of reform, Socrates uses the word "purge" (''diakathairountes'')&lt;ref&gt;Paragraph 399e line 5.&lt;/ref&gt; in the same sense that Forms exist purged of matter.

The purged society is a regulated one presided over by philosophers educated by the state, who maintain three non-hereditary classes&lt;ref&gt;"Types" (''genē'') rather than the English economic classes or the favored populations of the real Greek cities.&lt;/ref&gt; as required: the tradesmen (including merchants and professionals), the guardians (militia and police) and the philosophers (legislators, administrators and the philosopher-king). Class is assigned at the end of education, when the state institutes individuals in their occupation. Socrates expects class to be hereditary but he allows for mobility according to natural ability. The criteria for selection by the academics is ability to perceive forms (the analog of English "intelligence") and martial spirit as well as predisposition or aptitude.

The views of Socrates on the proper order of society are certainly contrary to Athenian values of the time and must have produced a shock effect, intentional or not, accounting for the animosity against him. For example, reproduction is much too important to be left in the hands of untrained individuals: "... the possession of women and the procreation of children ... will ... follow the general principle that friends have all things in common, ...."&lt;ref&gt;Paragraph 424.&lt;/ref&gt; The family is therefore to be abolished and the children – whatever their parentage – to be raised by the appointed mentors of the state.

Their genetic fitness is to be monitored by the physicians: "... he ([[Asclepius]], a culture hero) did not want to lengthen out good-for-nothing lives, or have weak fathers begetting weaker sons – if a man was not able to live in the ordinary way he had no business to cure him ...."&lt;ref&gt;Paragraph 407.&lt;/ref&gt; Physicians minister to the healthy rather than cure the sick: "... (Physicians) will minister to better natures, giving health both of soul and of body; but those who are diseased in their bodies they will leave to die, and the corrupt and incurable souls they will put an end to themselves."&lt;ref&gt;Paragraph 410.&lt;/ref&gt; Nothing at all in Greek medicine so far as can be known supports the airy (in the Athenian view) propositions of Socrates. Yet it is hard to be sure of Socrates' real views considering that there are no works written by Socrates himself. There are two common ideas pertaining to the beliefs and character of Socrates: the first being the Mouthpiece Theory where writers use Socrates in dialogue as a mouthpiece to get their own views across. However, since most of what we know about Socrates comes from plays, most of the Platonic plays are accepted as the more accurate Socrates since Plato was a direct student of Socrates.

Perhaps the most important principle is that just as the Good must be supreme so must its image, the state, take precedence over individuals in everything. For example, guardians "... will have to be watched at every age in order that we may see whether they preserve their resolution and never, under the influence either of force or enchantment, forget or cast off their sense of duty to the state."&lt;ref&gt;Paragraph 412.&lt;/ref&gt; This concept of requiring guardians of guardians perhaps suffers from the Third Man weakness (see below): guardians require guardians require guardians, ad infinitum. The ultimate trusty guardian is missing. Socrates does not hesitate to face governmental issues many later governors have found formidable: "Then if anyone at all is to have the privilege of lying, the rulers of the state should be the persons, and they ... may be allowed to lie for the public good."&lt;ref&gt;Paragraph 389.&lt;/ref&gt;

Plato's conception of Forms actually differs from dialogue to dialogue, and in certain respects it is never fully explained, so many aspects of the theory are open to interpretation. Forms are first introduced in the Phaedo, but in that dialogue the concept is simply referred to as something the participants are already familiar with, and the theory itself is not developed. Similarly, in the Republic, Plato relies on the concept of Forms as the basis of many of his arguments but feels no need to argue for the validity of the theory itself or to explain precisely what Forms are. Commentators have been left with the task of explaining what Forms are and how visible objects participate in them, and there has been no shortage of disagreement. Some scholars advance the view that Forms are paradigms, perfect examples on which the imperfect world is modeled. Others interpret Forms as universals, so that the Form of Beauty, for example, is that quality that all beautiful things share. Yet others interpret Forms as "stuffs," the conglomeration of all instances of a quality in the visible world. Under this interpretation, we could say there is a little beauty in one person, a little beauty in another—all the beauty in the world put together is the Form of Beauty. Plato himself was aware of the ambiguities and inconsistencies in his Theory of Forms, as is evident from the incisive criticism he makes of his own theory in the Parmenides.

==Evidence of Forms==
Plato's main evidence for the existence of Forms is [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuitive]] only and is as follows.

===Human perception===
We call both the sky and blue jeans by the same color, blue. However, clearly a pair of jeans and the sky are not the same color; moreover, the wavelengths of light reflected by the sky at every location and all the millions of blue jeans in every state of fading constantly change, and yet we somehow have a consensus of the basic form Blueness as it applies to them. Says Plato:&lt;ref&gt;''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'', paragraph 440.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle]] in ''Metaphysics'' Α987a.29–b.14 and Μ1078b9–32 says that Plato devised the Forms to answer a weakness in the doctrine of [[Heraclitus]], who held that nothing exists, but everything is in a state of flow. If nothing exists then nothing can be known. It is possible that Plato took the Socratic search for definitions and extrapolated it into a distinct metaphysical theory. Little is known of the historical Socrates' own views, but the theory of Forms is likely a Platonic innovation.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;But if the very nature of knowledge changes, at the time when the change occurs there will be no knowledge, and, according to this view, there will be no one to know and nothing to be known: but if that which knows and that which is known exist ever, and the beautiful and the good and every other thing also exist, then I do not think that they can resemble a process of flux, as we were just now supposing.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Plato believed that long before our bodies ever existed, our souls existed and inhabited heaven, where they became directly acquainted with the forms themselves. Real knowledge, to him, was knowledge of the forms. But knowledge of the forms cannot be gained through sensory experience because the forms are not in the physical world. Therefore, our real knowledge of the forms must be the memory of our initial acquaintance with the forms in heaven. Therefore, what we seem to learn is in fact just remembering.&lt;ref&gt;Kidder, D. S. and Oppenheim, N. D, (2006), The Intellectual Devotional, p27, Borders Group, Inc, Ann Arbor. {{ISBN|978-1-60961-205-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perfection===
No one has ever seen a [[Perfection|perfect]] circle, nor a perfectly straight line, yet everyone knows what a circle and a straight line are. Plato utilizes the tool-maker's blueprint as evidence that Forms are real:&lt;ref&gt;''[[Cratylus (dialogue)|Cratylus]]'', paragraph 389.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;... when a man has discovered the instrument which is naturally adapted to each work, he must express this natural form, and not others which he fancies, in the material ....&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Perceived circles or lines are not exactly circular or straight, and true circles and lines could never be detected since by definition they are sets of infinitely small points. But if the perfect ones were not real, how could they direct the manufacturer?

==Criticisms of Platonic Forms==
===Self-criticism===
Plato was well aware of the limitations of the theory, as he offered  his own criticisms of it in his dialogue [[Parmenides (dialogue)|''Parmenides'']].  There Socrates is portrayed as a young philosopher acting as junior counterfoil to aged Parmenides. To a certain extent it is tongue-in-cheek as the older Socrates will have solutions to some of the problems  that are made to puzzle the younger.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

The dialogue does present a very real difficulty with the Theory of Forms, which Plato most likely only viewed as problems for later thought. These criticisms were later emphasized by [[Aristotle]] in rejecting an independently existing world of Forms. It is worth noting that Aristotle was a pupil and then a junior colleague of Plato; it is entirely possible that the presentation of ''Parmenides'' "sets up" for Aristotle; that is, they agreed to disagree.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

One difficulty lies in the conceptualization of the "participation" of an object in a form (or Form). The young Socrates conceives of his solution to the problem of the universals in another metaphor, which though wonderfully apt, remains to be elucidated:&lt;ref&gt;''[[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides]]'' 131.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Nay, but the idea may be like the day which is one and the same in many places at once, and yet continuous with itself; in this way each idea may be one and the same in all at the same time.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But exactly how is a Form like the day in being everywhere at once? The solution calls for a distinct form, in which the particular instances, which are not identical to the form, participate; i.e., the form is shared out somehow like the day to many places. The concept of "participate", represented in Greek by more than one word, is as obscure in Greek as it is in English. Plato hypothesized that distinctness meant existence as an independent being, thus opening himself to the famous [[third man argument]] of Parmenides,&lt;ref&gt;The name is from [[Aristotle]], who says in ''Metaphysics'' A.IX.990b.15: "(The argument) they call the third man." A summary of the argument and the quote from Aristotle can be found in the venerable {{Cite journal | first=George | last=Grote | author-link=George Grote | contribution=App I Aristotle's Objections to Plato's Theory  | title=Aristotle: Second Edition with Additions | year=1880 | pages=559–60 note b | place=London | publisher=John Murray }} (downloadable Google Books). Grote points out that Aristotle lifted this argument from the ''Parmenides'' of Plato; certainly, his words indicate the argument was already well-known under that name.&lt;/ref&gt; which proves that forms cannot independently exist and be participated.&lt;ref&gt;Analysis of the argument has been going on for quite a number of centuries now and some analyses are complex, technical and perhaps tedious for the general reader. Those who are interested in the more technical analyses can find more of a presentation in {{cite journal | last=Hales | first=Steven D. |  title=The Recurring Problem of the Third Man | journal=Auslegung | volume=17 | issue=1 | pages=67–80 | year=1991 | url=http://www.bloomu.edu/departments/philosophy/pages/content/hales/articlepdf/thirdman.pdf }} and {{cite journal | last=Durham | first=Michael | title=Two Men and the Third Man | journal=The Dualist: Undergraduate Journal of Philosophy (Stanford University) | volume=4 | year=1997 | url=http://philosophy.stanford.edu/apps/stanfordphilosophy/files/wysiwyg_images/durham.pdf | format= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If universal and particulars – say man or greatness – all exist and are the same then the Form is not one but is multiple. If they are only like each other then they contain a form that is the same and others that are different. Thus if we presume that the Form and a particular are alike then there must be another, or third Form, man or greatness by possession of which they are alike. An [[infinite regress]]ion would then result; that is, an endless series of third men. The ultimate participant, greatness, rendering the entire series great, is missing. Moreover, any Form is not unitary but is composed of infinite parts, none of which is the proper Form.

The young Socrates (some may say the young Plato) did not give up the Theory of Forms over the Third Man but took another tack, that the particulars do not exist as such. Whatever they are, they "mime" the Forms, appearing to be particulars. This is a clear dip into [[Representative realism|representationalism]], that we cannot observe the objects as they are in themselves but only their representations. That view has the weakness that if only the mimes can be observed then the real Forms cannot be known at all and the observer can have no idea of what the representations are supposed to represent or that they are representations.

Socrates' later answer would be that men already know the Forms because they were in the world of Forms before birth. The mimes only recall these Forms to memory.&lt;ref&gt;Plato to a large extent identifies what today is called [[insight]] with recollection: "whenever on seeing one thing you conceived another whether like or unlike, there must surely have been an act of recollection?" — ''[[Phaedo]]'', paragraph 229. Thus geometric reasoning on the part of persons who know no geometry is not insight but is  recollection. He does recognize insight: "... with a sudden flash there shines forth understanding about every problem ..." (with regard to "the course of scrutiny") — ''[[The Seventh Letter]]'' 344b. Unfortunately the hidden world can in no way be verified in this world and its otherworldness can only be a matter of speculation. Plato was aware of the problem: "How real existence is to be studied or discovered is, I suspect, beyond you and me." — ''[[Cratylus]]'', paragraph 439.&lt;/ref&gt;  The comedian [[Aristophanes]] wrote a play, ''[[The Clouds]]'', poking fun of Socrates with his head in the clouds.

===Aristotelian criticism===
[[Image:Sanzio 01 Plato Aristotle.jpg|thumb|180 px|The central image from Raphael's ''[[The School of Athens]]'' (1509-1511), depicting Plato (left) and Aristotle (right).  Plato is depicted pointing upwards, in reference to his belief in the higher Forms, while Aristotle disagrees and points downwards to the here-and-now, in reference to his belief in [[empiricism]].]]
The topic of Aristotle's criticism of Plato's Theory of Forms is a large one and continues to expand. Rather than quote Plato, Aristotle often summarized. Classical commentaries thus recommended Aristotle as an introduction to Plato. As a historian of prior thought, Aristotle was invaluable, however this was secondary to his own dialectic and in some cases he treats purported implications as if Plato had actually mentioned them, or even defended them. In examining Aristotle's criticism of The Forms, it is helpful to understand Aristotle's own [[hylomorphism|hylomorphic forms]], by which he intends to salvage much of Plato's theory.

In the summary passage quoted above&lt;ref name=summ&gt;Paragraph 50 a–c, Jowett translation.&lt;/ref&gt; Plato distinguishes between real and non-real "existing things", where the latter term is used of substance. The figures that the artificer places in the gold are not substance, but gold is. Aristotle stated that, for Plato, all things studied by the sciences have Form and asserted that Plato considered only substance to have Form. Uncharitably, this leads him to something like a contradiction: Forms existing as the objects of science, but not-existing as non-substance. Scottish philosopher [[W.D. Ross]] objects to this as a mischaracterization of Plato.&lt;ref name=rossXI&gt;Ross, Chapter XI, initial.&lt;/ref&gt;

Plato did not claim to know where the line between Form and non-Form is to be drawn. As Cornford points out,&lt;ref&gt;Pages 82–83.&lt;/ref&gt; those things about which the young Socrates (and Plato) asserted "I have often been puzzled about these things"&lt;ref&gt;''[[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides]]'', paragraph 130c.&lt;/ref&gt; (in reference to Man, Fire and Water), appear as Forms in later works. However, others do not, such as Hair, Mud, Dirt. Of these, Socrates is made to assert, "it would be too absurd to suppose that they have a Form."

Ross&lt;ref name=rossXI/&gt; also objects to Aristotle's criticism that Form Otherness accounts for the differences between Forms and purportedly leads to contradictory forms: the Not-tall, the Not-beautiful, etc. That particulars participate in a Form is for Aristotle much too vague to permit analysis. By one way in which he unpacks the concept, the Forms would cease to be of one essence due to any multiple participation. As Ross indicates, Plato didn't make that leap from "A is not B" to "A is Not-B." Otherness would only apply to its own particulars and not to those of other Forms. For example, there is no Form Not-Greek, only ''particulars'' of Form Otherness that somehow ''suppress'' Form Greek.

Regardless of whether Socrates meant the particulars of Otherness yield Not-Greek, Not-tall, Not-beautiful, etc., the particulars would operate specifically rather than generally, each somehow yielding only one exclusion.

Plato had postulated that we know Forms through a remembrance of the soul's [[metempsychosis|past lives]] and Aristotle's arguments against this treatment of [[epistemology]] are compelling. For Plato, particulars somehow do not exist, and, on the face of it, "that which is non-existent cannot be known".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Posterior Analytics]]'' 71b.25.&lt;/ref&gt; See ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' III 3–4.&lt;ref&gt;Book III Chapters 3–4, paragraphs 999a ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pcuv12.jpg|thumb|Building 3.CUE University Enterprise Centre of the University of Valencia Science Park business area]]

The '''University of Valencia Science Park''' ({{lang-ca-valencia|Parc Científic de la Universitat de València}} also known by the acronym ''PCUV'') provides spaces and services to companies resulting from university research, –[[University spin-off|spin-off]]–, and other companies and R &amp; D departments with content related to the innovative nature of the PCUV.

The PCUV has a scientific area that includes six research institutes, two centres and services and facilities for research; and a business area that currently houses more than seventy young or already established companies, mainly from the sectors of biotechnology and information and communication technologies (ICT).

In addition, The University of Valencia Science Park houses the technical office of the Emprendia Network (Iberoamerican University Network of Business Incubation), which enables the expansion of businesses in the science parks of universities that make up the network. It is also a member of the rePCV (Network of Valencian Science Parks), APTE (Association of Science and Technology Parks of Spain) and the IASP (International Association of Science and Technology Parks).

'''The University of Valencia Science Park Foundation'''

The University of Valencia Science Park Foundation was established 9 March 2009 as a private organization with a general interest established under the aegis of the protectorate
of the Generalitat Valenciana. The founding benefactors are Fundación Bancaja, Banco Santander, the Valencian Chamber of Commerce, the Valencian Business Confederation, and the
University of Valencia. Foundation manages the Science Park with the purpose of promoting technological development, knowledge transfer and industrial innovation, among other things.
