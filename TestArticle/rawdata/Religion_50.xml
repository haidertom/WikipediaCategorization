      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5865">The '''1888–1893 Uprisings of Hazaras''' occurred when the [[Treaty of Gandomak]] was signed and the [[Second Anglo-Afghan War]] ended in 1880, causing [[Abdur Rahman Khan]] to set out on a goal to bring Hazarajat and [[Kafiristan]] under his control. He launched several campaigns in Hazarajat due to resistance from the Hazaras in which his forces committed atrocities. The southern part of Hazarajat was spared as they accepted his rule, while the other parts of Hazarajat rejected Abdur Rahman and instead supported his uncle, [[Sher Ali Khan]]. In response to this Abdur Rahman waged a war against tribal leaders who rejected his policies and rule.&lt;ref name="Monsutti"&gt;"HAZĀRA: ii. HISTORY". Alessandro Monsutti (Online ed.).

==First uprising==
The first Hazara uprising against Abdur Rahman Khan took place between 1888 and 1890. When Emir Abdur Rahman's cousin, Mohammad Eshaq, revolted against him, tribal leaders of the Sheikh Ali Hazaras joined the revolt. The revolt was short lived as the Emir extended his control over large parts of Hazarajat.

After all of Sheikh Ali Hazaras' chiefs were sent to [[Kabul]], opposition within the leadership of Sawar Khan and Syed Jafar Khan continued against the government troops, but at last were defeated. Taxes were imposed and Afghan administrators were sent to occupied places, where they subjugated the people with abuses.&lt;ref name="Monsutti"/&gt; People were disarmed, villages were looted, local tribal chiefs were imprisoned or executed, and the better lands were confiscated and given to Afghan [[nomad]]s ([[Kuchis]]).&lt;ref name=Mousavi/&gt;

==Second uprising==
The second uprising occurred in the Spring of 1892. According to [[Syed Askar Mousavi]], the cause of the uprising was an assault on the wife of a Hazara Chieftain by Afghan soldiers.  The families of both the man and his wife, deciding that death was one hundred times better than such humiliation, killed the soldiers involved and attacked the local garrison, from whence they recovered their confiscated arms".&lt;ref name="Monsutti"/&gt; Several other tribal chiefs who supported Abdur Rahman now turned against him and joined the rebellion which rapidly spread through the entire Hazarajat. In response to the rebellion, the Emir declared a "[[jihad]]" against the Shias&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Refworld {{!}} World Directory of Minorities and Indigenous Peoples – Afghanistan : Hazaras|url = http://www.refworld.org/docid/49749d693d.html|website = Refworld|access-date = 2016-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and raised an army of up to 40, 000 soldiers, 10, 000 mounted troops, and 100,000 armed civilians (most of which were Pashtun nomads).&lt;ref name="Monsutti"/&gt; He also brought in [[British Raj|British]] military advisers to assist his army.&lt;ref name=Mousavi&gt;{{cite book |last= Mousavi|first= Sayed Askar|title= The Hazaras of Afghanistan: An Historical, Cultural, Economic and Political Study|origyear= 1997|year= 1998 |publisher= St. Martin's Press|location = Richmond, NY|isbn= 0-312-17386-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third uprising of Hazara was in response to the harsh repression; the Hazara revolted again by early 1893. This revolt took the government forces by surprise and the Hazara managed to take most of Hazarajat back. However, after months of fighting, they were eventually defeated due to a shortage of food. Small pockets of resistance continued to the end of the year as government troops committed atrocities against civilians and deported entire villages.&lt;ref name=Mousavi/&gt;

Abdur Rahman's subjugation of the Hazara due to fierce rebellion against the Afghan king gave birth to strong hatred between the Pahstun and Hazara for years to come. Massive forced displacements, especially in Oruzgan and [[Daychopan District|Daychopan]], continued as lands were confiscated and populations were expelled or fled. Some 35,000 families fled to northern Afghanistan, [[Mashhad]] (Iran) and [[Quetta]] (Pakistan). Hazara farmers were often forced to give up their property to Pashtuns&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = تاریخ باستانی هزاره ها|last = دلجو|first = عباس|publisher = انتشارات امیری|year = 2014|isbn = 9936801504|location = کابل|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a result many Hazara families had to leave seasonally to the [[List of cities in Afghanistan|major cities in Afghanistan]], Iran, or Pakistan in order to find jobs and a source of income. Quetta in Pakistan is home to the third largest settlements of Hazara outside Afghanistan.

[[File:A Mathematician's Apology.pdf|thumb|Full text of the "A Mathematician's Apology" by G. H. Hardy.]]

'''''A Mathematician's Apology''''' is a 1940 essay by British mathematician [[G. H. Hardy]].  It concerns the [[Mathematical beauty|aesthetics of mathematics]]  with some personal content, and gives the layman an insight into the mind of a working [[mathematician]].

==Summary==
[[File:Ghhardy@72.jpg|thumb|left|In ''A Mathematician's Apology'', [[G. H. Hardy]] defined a set of criteria for mathematical beauty.]]
In the book's title, Hardy uses the word "[[Apologetics|apology]]" in the sense of a formal justification or defence (as in [[Plato]]'s ''[[Apology (Plato)|Apology of Socrates]]''), not in the sense of a plea for forgiveness.

Hardy felt the need to justify his life's work in mathematics at this time mainly for two reasons. Firstly, at age 62, Hardy felt the approach of old age (he had survived a heart attack in 1939) and the decline of his mathematical creativity and skills.
By devoting time to writing the Apology, Hardy was admitting that his own time as a creative mathematician was finished. In his foreword to the 1967 edition of the book, [[C. P. Snow]] describes the Apology as
"a passionate lament for creative powers that used to be and that will never come again".
In Hardy's words, "Exposition, criticism, appreciation, is work for second-rate minds. [...] It is a melancholy experience for a professional mathematician to find himself writing about mathematics. The function of a mathematician is to do something, to prove new theorems, to add to mathematics, and not to talk about what he or other mathematicians have done."

Secondly, at the start of the [[World War II]], Hardy, a committed [[pacifist]], wanted to justify his belief that mathematics should be pursued for its own sake rather than for the sake of its applications. He wanted to write a book in which he would explain his mathematical philosophy to the next generation of mathematicians; that would defend mathematics by elaborating on the merits of pure mathematics solely, without having to resort to the attainments of applied mathematics in order to justify the overall importance of mathematics; and that would inspire the upcoming generations of pure mathematicians. Hardy was an [[atheist]], and makes his justification not to [[God]] but to his fellow man.

One of the main themes of the book is the beauty that mathematics possesses, which Hardy compares to painting and poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=King |first1=Jerry P. |title=The Art of Mathematics |date=1992 |publisher=Fawcett Columbine |isbn=0-449-90835-6 |pages=135–139}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For Hardy, the most beautiful mathematics was that which had no practical applications in the outside world ([[pure mathematics]]) and, in particular, his own special field of [[number theory]].  Hardy contends that if useful knowledge is defined as knowledge which is likely to contribute to the material comfort of mankind in the near future (if not right now), so that mere intellectual satisfaction is irrelevant, then the great bulk of higher mathematics is useless.  He justifies the pursuit of pure mathematics with the argument that its very "uselessness" on the whole meant that it could not be misused to cause harm.  On the other hand, Hardy denigrates much of the [[applied mathematics]] as either being "trivial", "ugly", or  "dull", and contrasts it with "real mathematics", which is how he ranks the higher, pure mathematics.

Hardy expounds by commenting about a phrase attributed to [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] that "Mathematics is the queen of the sciences and number theory is the queen of mathematics." Some people believe that it is the extreme non-applicability of number theory that led Gauss to the above statement about number theory; however, Hardy points out that this is certainly not the reason. If an application of number theory were to be found, then certainly no one would try to dethrone the "queen of mathematics" because of that. What [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] meant, according to Hardy, is that the underlying concepts that constitute number theory are deeper and more elegant compared to those of any other branch of mathematics.

Another theme is that mathematics is a "young man's game", so anyone with a talent for mathematics should develop and use that talent while they are young, before their ability to create original mathematics starts to decline in middle age. This view reflects Hardy's increasing depression at the wane of his own mathematical powers. For Hardy, real mathematics was essentially a creative activity, rather than an explanatory or expository one.

==Critiques==
[[File:MathematiciansApology.jpg|thumb|First edition&lt;br&gt;(publ. [[Cambridge University Press]])]]

Hardy's opinions were heavily influenced by the [[academia|academic]] culture of the universities of [[Cambridge]] and [[Oxford]] between [[World War I]] and [[World War II]].

Some of Hardy's examples seem unfortunate in retrospect. For example, he writes, "No one has yet discovered any warlike purpose to be served by the theory of numbers or relativity, and it seems unlikely that anyone will do so for many years." Since then number theory was used to crack German enigma codes and much later, figure prominently in [[public-key cryptography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wayback.cecm.sfu.ca/personal/jborwein/apaper.pdf|title=Experimental mathematician Jonathan Borwein's comments on the Apology|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Hardy's more prominent examples of elegant mathematical discoveries with no use (proofs of [[Euclid's theorem|the infinitude of primes]] and of [[Square root of 2|the irrationality of the square root of two]]) still hold up.

The applicability of a mathematical concept is not the reason that Hardy considered applied mathematics somehow inferior to pure mathematics, though; it is the simplicity and prosiness that belong to applied mathematics that led him to describe them as he did.

He considers that [[Rolle's theorem]] for example, though it is of some importance for [[calculus]], cannot be compared to the elegance and preeminence of the mathematics produced by [[Évariste Galois]] and other pure mathematicians.

The '''Agasha Temple of Wisdom''' is a [[spiritualism|spiritualist]] group founded in 1943 by [[Richard Zenor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=James|title=The Encyclopedia of Cults, Sects, and New Religions|date=1998|publisher=Prometheus Books|isbn=1573922226|page=32|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=oVQUAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=8 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the publication of [[James Crenshaw]]'s book ''Telephone Between Two Worlds'' in 1950, in which both Zenor and the temple were prominently featured, the temple became more popular. Upon Zenor's death in 1978, Geary Salvat was chosen to lead the group.

Geary Salvat is a follower of both Richard Zenor and of Ayuibbi Tobabu, and he has written a journal of quotes, ''Getting Into Gear''. He died in 2002.

The group focuses on communicating with the dead through [[mediumship|mediums]], placing particular attention on receiving and studying the teachings of "master teachers" such as Zenor's "Agasha".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Malony|first1=H.

{{distinguish|Alatri|Alastrim}}
'''Alatrism''' or '''alatry''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: from the [[privative a|privative ἀ-]] + λατρεία (''latreia'') = [[worship]]) is the recognition of the existence of one or more gods, but with a deliberate lack of worship of any deity. Typically, it includes the belief that religious rituals have no [[supernatural]] significance, and that gods ignore all prayers and worship.

Alatrism is not the same as [[Deism]], which holds that one or more gods may exist, but do not intervene. Deism does not exclude worship, and alatrism does not exclude the possibility that gods intervene; alatrists usually believe that any divine intervention occurs only for the deity's/deities' own reasons, unconnected to any encouragement by devotees.

Historical alatrist groups include the [[Neopythagoreanism|Neopythagoreans]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28668">'''Civil religion''', also referred to as a '''civic religion''',&lt;ref name=BRMyers/&gt; is the implicit religious values of a nation, as expressed through public [[ritual]]s, symbols (such as the national flag), and ceremonies on sacred days and at sacred places (such as monuments, battlefields, or national cemeteries). It is distinct from churches, although church officials and ceremonies are sometimes incorporated into the practice of civil religion.{{sfn|Wimberley|Swatos|1998}} Countries described as having a civil religion include France,&lt;ref name=BaylacFrance/&gt; South Korea,&lt;ref name=BRMyers/&gt; and the former Soviet Union.{{sfn|Tumarkin|1983}} As a concept, it originated in French [[political thought]] and became a major topic for U.S. [[sociologist]]s since its use by [[Robert Bellah]] in 1960.

==Origin of term==
[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] coined the term in chapter 8, book 4 of ''[[The Social Contract]]'' (1762), to describe what he regarded as the moral and spiritual foundation essential for any modern society. For Rousseau, civil religion was intended simply as a form of social cement, helping to unify the [[State (polity)|state]] by providing it with sacred authority. In his book, [[Rousseau]] outlines the simple [[dogma]]s of the civil religion:
# [[deity]]
# [[afterlife]]
# the reward of [[virtue]] and the punishment of [[vice]]
# the exclusion of [[religious intolerance]]{{sfnm |1a1=Bellah |1y=1967 |2a1=Juergensmeyer |2y=2003 |2p=245 |3a1=Meyer-Dinkgrafe |3y=2004 |3p=30 |4a1=Shanks |4y=2000 |4p=29}}
The Italian historian [[Emilio Gentile]] has studied the roots and development of the concept and proposed a division of two types of religions of politics: a civil religion and a [[political religion]].{{sfn|Gentile|2006}}

==Sociology of religion==
[[File:National Cathedral.jpg|thumb|The [[Washington National Cathedral]] in [[Washington, DC]], is often used for state [[funeral]]s for political leaders.]]
In the [[sociology of religion]], '''civil religion''' is the [[folk religion]] of a [[nation]] or a [[politics|political]] [[culture]].{{dubious|date=October 2012}}{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Civil religion stands somewhat above folk religion in its social and political status, since by definition it suffuses an entire society, or at least a segment of a society; and is often practiced by [[leadership|leader]]s within that society.  On the other hand, it is somewhat less than an [[establishment of religion]], since established churches have official [[clergy]] and a relatively fixed and formal relationship with the government that establishes them. Civil religion is usually practiced by political leaders who are laypeople and whose leadership is not specifically spiritual.

===Examples===

Such civil religion encompasses such things as:{{sfn|Bellah|1992}}
*the invocation of God in political speeches and public monuments;
*the quotation of [[religious text]]s on public occasions by political leaders;
*the veneration of past political leaders;
*the use of the lives of these leaders to teach moral ideals;
*the veneration of veterans and casualties of a nation's wars;
*religious gatherings called by political leaders;
*the use of religious symbols on public buildings;
*the use of public buildings for worship;
*[[founding myth]]s and other [[national myth]]s
and similar religious or quasi-religious practices.

==Practical political philosophy==
[[File:Arc De Triomphe 2004.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Arc de Triomphe]]'' in [[Paris]] commemorates those who died in France's wars.]]

Professional commentators on political and social matters writing in newspapers and magazines sometimes use the term '''''civil religion''''' or '''''civic religion''''' to refer to [[ritual]] expressions of [[patriotism]] of a sort practiced in all countries, not always including religion in the conventional sense of the word.

Among such practices are the following:{{sfn|Bellah|1992}}
*crowds singing the national anthem at certain public gatherings;
*parades or display of the national flag on certain [[National Day|patriotic holidays]];
*reciting [[oath of allegiance|oaths of allegiance]] (like the pledges of allegiance found in countries such as the [[Pledge of Allegiance (Bahamas)|Bahamas]], [[Pledge of Allegiance to the Philippine Flag|the Philippines]], and [[Pledge of Allegiance (South Korea)|South Korea]]);
*ceremonies concomitant to the inauguration of a president or the coronation of a monarch;
*retelling exaggerated, one-sided, and simplified [[mythology|mythologized]] tales of [[List of national founders|national founders]] and other great leaders or great events (e.g., battles, mass migrations) in the past (in this connection, see also [[romantic nationalism]]);
*[[monument]]s commemorating great leaders of the past or historic events;
*monuments to dead soldiers or annual ceremonies to remember them;
*expressions of [[reverence (attitude)|reverence]] for the state, the predominant national racial/ethnic group,&lt;ref name=BRMyers/&gt; the national constitution, or the monarch;
*expressions of solidarity with people perceived as being national kindred but residing in a foreign country or a foreign country perceived as being similar enough to the nation to warrant admiration and/or loyalty;&lt;ref name=BRMyers/&gt;
*expressions of hatred towards another country or foreign ethnic group perceived as either currently being an enemy of the state and/or as having wronged and slighted the nation in the past;&lt;ref name=BRMyers/&gt;
*public display of the coffin of a recently deceased political leader.

==Relation between the two conceptions==

These two conceptions (sociological and political) of '''civil religion''' substantially overlap. In Britain, where church and state are constitutionally joined, the monarch's coronation is an elaborate religious rite celebrated by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. In France, secular ceremonies are separated from religious observances to a greater degree than in most countries. In the United States, a president being inaugurated is told by the Constitution to choose between saying [[oath of office|"I do solemnly swear..."]] (customarily followed by "so help me God", although those words are not Constitutionally required) and saying "I do solemnly affirm..." (in which latter case no mention of God would be expected).

==History==

===Prehistory and classical antiquity===
{{Disputed section|date=September 2011}}
[[File:Bas relief from Arch of Marcus Aurelius showing sacrifice.jpg|thumb|The emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]], his [[capite velato|head ritually covered]], conducts a public sacrifice at the Temple of Jupiter]]
Practically all the ancient and prehistoric reigns suffused politics with religion. Often the leaders, such as the [[Pharaoh]] or the [[Chinese Emperor]] were considered manifestations of a [[Divinity]]. Tribal world-view was often [[Pantheism|Pantheistic]], the tribe being an extension of its surrounding nature and the leaders having roles and symbols derived from the animal hierarchy and significant natural phenomena (such as storm).

The religion of the Athenian [[polis]] was a secular [[polytheism]] focused on the [[Olympian Gods]] and was celebrated in the civic festivals. Religion was a matter of state and the Athenian [[Ecclesia (ancient Athens)|Ecclesia]] deliberated on matters of religion. Atheism and the introduction of foreign gods were forbidden in Athens and punishable by death. For example, the Athenian ecclesia charged that [[Socrates]] worshiped gods other than those sanctioned by the polis and condemned him to death.

Rome also had a civil religion, whose first Emperor [[Augustus]] officially attempted to revive the dutiful practice of classical [[paganism]]. [[Religion in Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]] were essentially local in character; the [[Roman Empire]] attempted to unite its disparate territories by inculcating an ideal of Roman piety, and by a [[syncretism|syncretistic]] identifying of the gods of conquered territories with the Greek and Roman [[Greek mythology|pantheon]].  In this campaign, Augustus erected monuments such as the ''[[Ara Pacis]]'', the Altar of Peace, showing the [[Roman Emperor|Emperor]] and his family worshiping the gods.  He also encouraged the publication of works such as [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid|Æneid]]'', which depicted "pious [[Aeneas|Æneas]]", the [[legend]]ary ancestor of [[Rome]], as a role model for Roman religiosity. Roman historians such as [[Livy]] told tales of early Romans as morally improving stories of military prowess and civic virtue. The Roman civil religion later became centered on the person of the Emperor through the [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Imperial cult]], the worship of the ''[[genius (mythology)|genius]]'' of the Emperor.{{sfn|O'Donovan|1996}}

===Rousseau and Durkheim===
The phrase ''civil religion'' was first discussed extensively by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] in his 1762 treatise ''The Social Contract''. Rousseau defined ''civil religion'' as a group of religious beliefs he believed to be universal, and which he believed governments had a right to uphold and maintain: belief in a deity; belief in an afterlife in which [[virtue]] is rewarded and vice punished; and belief in [[freedom of religion|religious tolerance]].  He said the dogmas of civil religion should be simple, few in number, and stated in precise words without interpretations or commentaries.{{sfn|Beiner|1993}} Beyond that, Rousseau affirmed that individuals' religious opinions should be beyond the reach of governments.  For Rousseau civil religion was to be constructed and imposed from the top down as an artificial source of civic virtue.{{sfn|Demerath|Williams|1985}}

Wallace studies [[Émile Durkheim]] (1858–1917), the French sociologist who analysed civil religion, especially in comparative terms, and stressed that the public schools are critical in implementing civil religion. Although he never used the term he laid great stress on the concept.{{sfn|Wallace|1977}}

==Examples==
===France===
Secular states in Europe by the late 19th century were building civil religion based on their recent histories. In France's case, Baylac argues, the French government:
{{quote|encouraged a veritable state religion, worshiping the flag and multiplying the national holidays and commemorative monuments.&amp;nbsp;... July 14 became a national holiday in 1882; the centennial of the French Revolution was celebrated in 1889. In Italy, the secular state multiplied the celebrations: State holidays, King and Queen's birthdays, pilgrimage of 1884 to the tomb of Victor-Emmanuel II. A patriotic ideology was created.&lt;ref name=BaylacFrance&gt;{{cite book |last=Baylac |first=M.-H. |year=1997 |title=Histoire 1ère |language=fr |location=Paris |publisher=Bordas |page=134}} Quoted in {{harvnb|Lindaman|Ward|2013|p=148}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===South Korea===
In contemporary South Korea, the predominating civil religion has been described as consisting of [[Anti-Japanese sentiment in Korea|anti-Japanese sentiment]] coupled with a pan-[[Korean racial nationalism]].&lt;ref name=BRMyers/&gt; This has been criticized by some scholars as being detrimental to South Korean national security as it encourages North Korean provocations against the country in the guise that South Koreans will not adequately defend their country's security as they feel a certain racial and ethnic solidarity with North Korea.&lt;ref name=BRMyers&gt;{{cite web|url=https://soundcloud.com/war_college/what-north-korea-wants|title=What North Korea Wants|date=2017|first=Brian Reynolds|authorlink=Brian Reynolds Myers|last=Myers|publisher=Soundcloud|work=Reuters War College|quote=The South needs to retire the conventional civic religion here, which is anti-Japanese pan-Korean nationalism in favor of a collective identification of civic principles.|access-date=2 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; One scholar argued that South Korea should retire this sort of racialized civil religion for one more rooted in civic principles, like was found in [[West Germany]] during the 20th century.&lt;ref name=BRMyers/&gt;

===Soviet Union===
[[File:Dubna Lenin.JPG|thumb|Statue of Lenin at [[Dubna]], Russia, built in 1937; it is 25 metres tall]]
The Soviet Union made [[Marxism–Leninism]] into a civil religion, with sacred texts and [[List of statues of Vladimir Lenin|many statues of Marx, Lenin, and Stalin.]]{{sfn|Tumarkin|1983}} Stalin personally supervised the cult of Lenin and his own cult, which took advantage of the historic semi-religious adulation Russian peasants had shown toward the tsars.{{sfn|Plamper|2012}} The Lenin icons were put into storage when [[fall of communism|communism fell in 1991]]. The [[List of statues of Stalin|Stalin statues]] had been [[de-Stalinization|removed]] in the 1950s and mention of him was erased from encyclopedias and history books. However under [[Vladimir Putin]] in the 21st century the memory of Stalin has been partly rehabilitated in search of a strong leader who made the nation powerful.  For example, school textbooks were rewritten to portray "the mass terror of the Stalin years as essential to the country's rapid modernization in the face of growing German and Japanese military threats, and amid the inaction or duplicity of the Western democracies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Sherlock |first=Thomas |year=2011 |title=Confronting the Stalinist Past: The Politics of Memory in Russia |url=https://csis-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/legacy_files/files/publication/twq11springsherlock.pdf |magazine=The Washington Quarterly |volume=34 |issue=2 |page=97 |issn=1530-9177 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180225034518/https://csis-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/legacy_files/files/publication/twq11springsherlock.pdf |archive-date=25 February 2018 |access-date=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{main|American civil religion}}
Civil religion is an important component of public life in America, especially at the national level for its celebration of [[nationalism]]. Sociologists report that its "feast days" are [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]], [[Veterans Day]], and [[Memorial Day]]. Its rituals include salutes to the flag and singing "[[God Bless America]]".{{sfn|Bruce|Yearley|2006|p=34}} Soldiers and veterans play a central role of standing ready to sacrifice their lives to preserve the nation. Bellah noted the veneration of veterans.{{sfn|Bellah|1992}} The historian Conrad Cherry called the Memorial Day ceremonies "a modern cult of the dead" and says that it "affirms the civil religious tenets."{{sfn|Wilsey|2015|p=24}}

====American Revolution====
{{Further|Commemoration of the American Revolution}}
The American Revolution was the main source of the civil religion that has shaped patriotism ever since. According to the sociologist Robert Bellah:
{{quote|Behind the civil religion at every point lie biblical archetypes: Exodus, Chosen People, Promised Land, New Jerusalem, and Sacrificial Death and Rebirth. But it is also genuinely American and genuinely new. It has its own prophets and its own martyrs, its own sacred events and sacred places, its own solemn rituals and symbols. It is concerned that America be a society as perfectly in accord with the will of God as men can make it, and a light to all nations.{{sfn|Bellah|1967}}}}

Albanese argues that the American Revolution was the main source of the non-denominational [[American civil religion]] that has shaped patriotism and the memory and meaning of the nation's birth ever since. Battles are not central (as they are for the Civil War) but rather certain events and people have been celebrated as icons of certain virtues (or vices). As historians have noted, the Revolution produced a Moses-like leader ([[George Washington]]), prophets ([[Thomas Jefferson]], [[Tom Paine]]) and martyrs ([[Boston Massacre]], [[Nathan Hale]]), as well as devils ([[Benedict Arnold]]), sacred places ([[Valley Forge]], [[Battle of Bunker Hill|Bunker Hill]]), rituals ([[Boston Tea Party]]), emblems ([[American flag|the new flag]]), sacred holidays ([[July 4]]) and a holy scripture whose every sentence is carefully studied and applied in current law cases (the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]], and the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]]).{{sfn|Albanese|1977}}

Although "God" is not mentioned in the [[Constitution of the United States of America]], mention is specifically made of "[[Deism#Deism in the United States|Nature's God]]" in the opening sentence of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]].{{sfn|O'Donovan|1996}}

====Historiography====
[[File:Christian Flag etc Covenant Presbyterian Long Beach 20050213.jpg|thumb|The [[Christian flag]] displayed alongside the flag of the United States next to the pulpit in a church in California.  Note the eagle and cross finials on the flag poles.]]
In the 1960s and 1970s, scholars such as [[Robert N. Bellah]] and [[Martin E. Marty]] studied civil religion as a cultural phenomenon, attempting to identify the actual tenets of civil religion in the United States, or to study civil religion as a phenomenon of [[cultural anthropology]].  Within this American context, Marty wrote that Americans approved of "religion in general" without being particularly concerned about the content of that faith, and attempted to distinguish "priestly" and "prophetic" roles within the practice of American civil religion, which he preferred to call the ''public theology''.{{sfn|Marty|1989|p=295}} In the 1967 essay "Civil Religion in America", Bellah wrote that civil religion in its priestly sense is "an institutionalized collection of sacred beliefs about the American nation."  Bellah describes the prophetic role of civil religion as challenging "national self-worship" and calling for "the subordination of the nation to ethical principles that transcend it in terms of which it should be judged."{{sfn|Bellah|1967}} Bellah identified the [[American Revolution]], the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], and the [[Civil Rights Movement]] as three decisive historical events that impacted the content and imagery of civil religion in the United States.

The application of the concept of civil religion to the United States was in large part the work of sociologist [[Robert Bellah]]. He identified an elaborate system of practices and beliefs arising from America's unique historic experience and religiosity. Civil religion in the US was originally Protestant but brought in Catholics and Jews after World War II. Having no association with any religious sect, Civil religion was used in the 1960s to justify civil rights legislation. Americans ever since the colonial era talk of their obligation both collective and individual to carry out God's will on earth. [[George Washington]] was a sort of high priest, and the documents of the [[Founding Fathers]] have been treated as almost sacred texts. With the Civil War, says Bellah, came a new theme of death, sacrifice and rebirth, as expressed through [[Memorial Day]] rituals. Unlike France, the American civil religion was never anticlerical or militantly secular.{{sfn|Bellah|1967}}

==Current issues==
This assertive civil religion of the United States is an occasional cause of political friction between the US and Europe, where the literally religious form of civil religion has largely faded away in recent decades. In the United States, civil religion is often invoked under the name of "[[Judeo-Christian ethics]]", a phrase originally intended to be maximally inclusive of the several religions practiced in the United States, assuming that these faiths all share the same values. Alvin J. Schmidt argues that since the 1700s, expressions of civil religion in the United States have shifted from a deistic to a polytheistic stance.{{sfn|Schmidt|2004}}

Some scholars have argued that the [[Flag of the United States|American flag]] can be seen as a main [[totem]] of a national cult,&lt;ref&gt;Marvin and Ingle (1996). [http://www.asc.upenn.edu/USR/fcm/jaar.htm "Blood Sacrifice and the Nation: Revisiting Civil Religion"].&lt;/ref&gt; while others have argued that modern punishment is a form of civil religion.{{sfn|SpearIt|2013}} Arguing against mob violence and lynching, Abraham Lincoln declared in his 1838 Lyceum speech that the Constitution and the laws of the United States ought to become the "political religion" of each American.&lt;ref&gt;Address Before the Young Men's Lyceum of Springfield, Illinois January 27, 1838 [http://showcase.netins.net/web/creative/lincoln/speeches/lyceum.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1952">'''Compensationism''' is one of several theological doctrines, opposed to [[Probabilism]].

==Doctrine==
Compensationism maintains that a doubtful law is not devoid of all binding force, and that there must be a compensating reason, proportionate to the probability and gravity of the law, to justify the performance of the action which is probably forbidden. This teaching is based on an analogy with an act which has two effects, one good and the other bad. It is not lawful to perform such an act unless there is a justifying cause proportionate to the evil. In the case of a doubtful law the bad effect is the danger of material sin, and the good effect is the benefit, which arises from the performance of the action which is probably forbidden. Hence in this as in the former case, a compensating cause, proportionate to the probable evil, is required to justify the performance of the action.

Probabilists reply that this moral system leads to [[Tutiorism]], because it implies that if no compensating benefit exists, it is not lawful to perform an action so long as it certainly is not forbidden. Again, Probabilists say that the preservation of liberty is of itself a sufficient compensating reason when there is question of a law which is not certain. Finally, Probabilists are prepared to admit that, as a point of expediency though not of obligation, it is advisable to look for a compensating cause over and above the preservation of liberty when a confessor is directing penitents in the use of probable opinions. If no such compensating reason exists, the penitent can be advised, though not under pain of sin, to abstain from the performance of the action which is probably forbidden.

{{Criticism of Judaism}}
{{Lead too short|date=September 2016}}
'''Criticism of Judaism''' refers to criticism of [[Jewish]] [[Judaism|religious doctrines]], [[Jewish literature|texts]], [[Jewish laws|laws]] and [[Jewish culture|practices]].  Early criticism originated in inter-faith polemics between [[Christianity]] and Judaism.  Important [[disputations]] in the Middle Ages gave rise to widely publicized criticisms. Modern criticisms also reflect the inter-branch [[Jewish schisms]] between [[Orthodox Judaism]], [[Conservative Judaism]], and [[Reform Judaism]].

==Inter-branch criticisms==

===Criticism of Conservative Judaism from other branches===
{{Main|Criticism of Conservative Judaism}}
Conservative Judaism is criticized by some leaders of [[Orthodox Judaism]] for not properly following [[Halakha]] (Jewish religious law).&lt;ref&gt;[[Avi Shafran]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20060106063953/http://www.momentmag.com/archive/feb01/feat2.html "The Conservative Lie"], ''[[Moment (magazine)|Moment]]'', February 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also criticized by some leaders of [[Reform Judaism]] for being at odds with the principles of its young adult members on issues such as [[Interfaith marriage in Judaism|intermarriage]], [[Patrilineality|patrilineal descent]], and the ordination of homosexuals — all issues that Conservative Judaism opposes and Reform Judaism supports.&lt;ref name="Berkofsky"&gt;Joe Berkofsky, [http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/21714/edition_id/441/format/html/displaystory.html "Death of Conservative Judaism? Reform leader’s swipe sparks angry rebuttals"], ''[[j.]]'', March 5, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; (The Conservative movement has since moved in the direction of allowing for gay rabbis and the ''"celebration of same-sex commitment ceremonies."''&lt;ref name="gay rabbis"&gt;Laurie Goodstein,

===Criticism of traditional Judaism by reform movement===
{{See also|Reform movement in Judaism|Jewish schisms|Jewish Enlightenment}}
The [[Reform movement in Judaism|reform movement]] grew out of dissatisfaction with several aspects of [[Orthodox Judaism|traditional Judaism]] or [[Rabbinic Judaism]], as documented in [[polemics]] and other 19th- and early-20th-century writings.&lt;ref name="shmueli"&gt;Shmueli, Efraim (1990) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=uaU4NEWSvlQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Seven+Jewish%22+shmueli&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=1VkpTL-PAsWisQaW7MTEBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Seven Jewish cultures: a reinterpretation of Jewish history and thought]''  Cambridge University Press, p. 123, 167-168, 172-174, 177, 261.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Louis Jacobs]], a prominent Masorti Rabbi, described the polemics between the Orthodox and the Reform movements as follows: {{quote|text="The polemics between Orthodox, as the traditionalists came to be called, and the Reformers were fierce.  The Orthodox treated Reform as rank heresy, as no more than a religion of convenience which, if followed, would lead Jews altogether out of Judaism.   The Reformers retorted that, on the contrary, the danger to Jewish survival was occasioned by the Orthodox who, through their obscurantism, failed to see that the new challenges facing Judaism had to be faced consciously in the present as Judaism had faced, albeit unconsciously, similar challenges in the past." |sign=Louis Jacobs|source=''The Jewish religion: a companion'', Oxford University Press, p. 4. (1995)}}
[[David Einhorn (rabbi)|David Einhorn]], an American Reform rabbi, calls Reform Judaism a "liberation" of Judaism : {{quote|text="There is at present a rent in Judaism which affects its very life, and which no covering, however glittering, can repair. The evil which threatens to corrode gradually all the healthy bone and marrow must be completely eradicated, and this can be done only if, in the name and in the interest of the religion, we remove from the sphere of our religious life all that is corrupt and untenable, and solemnly absolve ourselves from all obligations toward it in the future; thus we may achieve the liberation of Judaism for ourselves and for our children, so as to prevent the estrangement from Judaism."|sign=David Einhorn|source=Philipson, David (1907) ''The Reform Movement in Judaism'', Macmillan.}}

The criticisms of traditional Judaism included criticisms asserting that the Torah's laws are not strictly binding;&lt;ref name="shmueli"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

*"Abraham Geiger ... stressed the belief in progress: the Bible and Talmud represent an early, primitive stage in a revelation that is still continuing.  Many traditional ceremonies (such as circumcision) are distressing to modern sensibility or incompatible with modern life... Geiger become increasingly convinced of the need to 'dethrone the Talmud'... " -  De Lange, Nicholas (2000),''An introduction to Judaism'',  Cambridge University Press,  p. 73
*"According to [Mordecai] Kaplan, the Jewish heritage, including the belief in God, must be reinterpreted so that it will be consistent with the intellectual outlook of the twentieth century. The Torah, which is Jewish civilization in practice, must be given a new functional interpretation." - Scult, Mel (1993) ''Judaism faces the twentieth century: a biography of Mordecai M. Kaplan'', Wayne State University Press, p. 341.
*"Israel drew within herself, shunned the world, and lived apart. In her seclusion her  religion became her all.  The interpretation of the Law and the construction put upon the commandments tended toward the upholding of the letter rather than the spirit. ... Reform was born to protect the spirit of the Law, to place the spirit above the letter, to make the latter subservient to the former.... The abolition of those forms and ceremonies that were not conducive to proper living, or that had, by reason of altered environment, become meaningless, was of the highest importance to the spiritual welfare of Israel." - Stern, Myer (1895), ''The rise and progress of reform Judaism: '', Harvard University, p. 5.
&lt;/ref&gt; criticisms asserting that many ceremonies and rituals are not necessary;&lt;ref&gt;

*"Reform Judaism rejected the concept of Divine revelation, and ... the law is considered instructional and inspirational but not binding, ... and by eliminating many ritual practices..." -  Dosick, Wayne D. (1995), ''Living Judaism: the complete guide to Jewish belief, tradition, and practice'', HarperCollins, p. 62.
*"Reform Judaism first took hold in Germany in the early nineteenth century.  This tradition asserts that many of the ritualistic practices and dogmas of the past are outmoded..... Reform Jews assumed a prerogative to choose which Biblical laws were worthy of their allegiance and which were not.... Orthodox Jews adhere to a literal interpretation of the Hebrew Bible and continue to observe all the traditional Jewish laws... Conservative Jews ... were ... less likely than the Orthodox to accept the infallibility of sacred texts asserting that 'the divine origin of Jewish law ... [was subject] to human development and application'". - Berger, Ronald J. (2002), ''Fathoming the Holocaust: a social problems approach'', Aldine Transaction, p. 179-180.
*"We hold that all such Mosaic and rabbinical laws as regulate diet, priestly purity, and dress originated in ages and under the influence of ideas entirely foreign to our present mental and spiritual state. They fail to impress the modern Jew with a spirit of priestly holiness; their observance in our days is apt rather to obstruct than to further modern spiritual elevation." - [[Pittsburgh Platform]], section 4.
*"...in the view of rabbinical Judaism every command of the written law in the Pentateuch (Torah sh'bikthab), and of the oral law (Torah sh'b'al peh), as codified in the Shulchan Aruk, is equally binding. The ceremonial law has equal potency with the religious and moral commands. Reform Judaism, on the other hand, claims that a distinction must be made between the universal precepts of religion and morality and the enactments arising from the circumstances and conditions of special times and places. Customs and ceremonies must change with the varying needs of different generations. Successive ages have their individual requirements for the satisfaction of the religious nature. No ceremonial law can be eternally binding. " -  Philipson, David (1907) ''The Reform Movement in Judaism'',  Macmillan (reprinted by University of California, 2007), p. 5-6.
&lt;/ref&gt; criticisms asserting that Rabbinical leadership is too authoritarian;&lt;ref name="shmueli"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
*".. the immense authoritarian power of the orthodox Rabbis and Hasidic Zadikkim in the traditionalist communities ... As a result, there was open conflict between the rebellious youth .. and the religious establishment.... This was the context in which a virulent 'anti-clericalism' developed among progressive Jewish intellectuals, leaving countless evidence in the shape of polemical articles, autobiographical works, and imaginative literature." - Lowy, Michael (1992), ''Redemption and utopia: Jewish libertarian thought in Central Europe : a study in elective affinity'', Stanford University Press, p. 45.
*"[Reform Judaism was] founded as a response by Jewish laity to the perceived authoritarian rigidity of traditional or Orthodox Judaism and its rabbis." - Palmer-Fernández, Gabriel (2004), ''The encyclopedia of religion and war'', Routledge,  p. 253.
*"Mosaism and rabbinic Judaism were appropriate for earlier ages, [Kohler] argued.  But the age of man's maturity called for freedom from the letter, from blind authority, 'from all restriction which curb the minds and encroach upon the hearts'.  The contemporary Jew had 'outgrown the guiding strings ... of infancy'; he was ready to walk on his own.  What he required was not law, but a 'living Judaism', both enlightened and pious, appealing to reason and emotion." - Meyer, Michael A. (1995)  ''Response to modernity: a history of the Reform Movement in Judaism'',  Wayne State University Press, p. 267.
*"There is a fatal split among Jews, first, because religious tenets and institutions have been kept forcibly on a level of a vanished era, and not permeated with the divine breath of refreshing life, while life itself hurried forward stormily; and secondly, because the religious leaders, lacking all knowledge of the world and of men, dreamed of other times and conditions, and held themselves aloof from the life of the new generation - hence resulted a superficial rationalism, inimical to all positive and historical faith, side by side with a rigid, unreasoning formalism". -  Philipson, David (1907) ''The Reform Movement in Judaism'',  Macmillan (reprinted by University of California, 2007), (quoting Abraham Kohn, rabbi of Hohemems in Tirol); p. 93-95.
&lt;/ref&gt; criticisms asserting that there was too much superstition;  criticisms asserting that traditional Judaism leads to isolation from other communities;&lt;ref&gt;

*"Emancipation implied the breakdown of the Jews' millennial social and cultural isolation ... It was said for the first time in European history the Jews could participate in non-Jewish culture without the stigma of apostacy". {{cite book

*"Sociologically, the way of life of halakhic Judaism vouchsafed Jewry to an unambiguously distinct ... identity - an identity that was the source of a profound discomfort to those Jews who sought cultural, social, and political integration in the Gentile community in which they lived." - ''The Jew in the modern world: a documentary history'' Paul R. Mendes-Flohr (Ed.),  p. 156
&lt;/ref&gt; and criticisms asserting that traditional Judaism over-emphasized the exile.&lt;ref name="shmueli"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
*" We recognize, in the modern era of universal culture of heart and intellect, the approaching of the realization of Israels great Messianic hope for the establishment of the kingdom of truth, justice, and peace among all men. We consider ourselves no longer a nation, but a religious community, and therefore expect neither a return to Palestine, nor a sacrificial worship under the sons of Aaron, nor the restoration of any of the laws concerning the Jewish state." - [[Pittsburgh Platform]]
&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of these criticisms were anticipated in a much earlier time, by philosopher [[Uriel da Costa]] (1585–1640) who criticized the Rabbinic authorities and the Talmud for lack of authenticity and spirituality.&lt;ref name="Spinozalife"/&gt;

===Paul's criticism of Judaism===
{{main|New Perspective on Paul|Paul the Apostle and Judaism|Pauline Christianity}}
[[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] criticizes Jews for their failure to believe that [[Jesus]] was the [[Messiah]] (Romans 9:30–10:13) and for their view about their favored status and lack of equality with [[gentiles]] (Roman 3:27).&lt;ref&gt;[[E. P. Sanders]], Paul the Law and Jewish People,  Fortress Press, p.154&lt;/ref&gt; In Romans 7–12, one criticism of Judaism made by Paul is that it is a religion based in law instead of faith. In many interpretations of this criticism made prior to the mid 20th century, Judaism was held to be fundamentally flawed by the sin of self-righteousness.&lt;ref name="zetterholm_2009"/&gt; The issue is complicated by differences in the versions of Judaism extant at the time. Some scholars argue that Paul's criticism of Judaism are correct, others suggest that Paul's criticism is directed at [[Hellenistic Judaism|Hellenistic]] Judaism, the forms with which Paul was most familiar,&lt;ref name="sanders_1977"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also the question as to whom Paul was addressing. Paul saw himself as an apostle to the Gentiles, and it is unclear as to whether the text of Romans was directed to Jewish followers of Jesus (as was Paul), to Gentiles, or to both.&lt;ref name="zetterholm_2009"/&gt; If adherence to Jewish law were a requirement for salvation, then salvation would be denied to Gentiles without a conversion to Judaism.&lt;ref name="sanders_1983"/&gt; Krister Stendahl argues along similar lines that according to Paul, Judaism's rejection of Jesus as a savior is what allows salvation of non-Jews, that this rejection is part of God's overall plan, and that Israel will also be saved (per [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+11%3A26-27&amp;version=KJV Romans 11:26–27]).&lt;ref name="zetterholm_2009"&gt;

Some scholars argue that the fundamental issue underlying Paul's criticism of Judaism hinges on his understanding of Judaism's relationship to Jewish law. E. P. Sanders, for example, argues that the view held by many New Testament scholars from Weber on,&lt;ref name="zetterholm_2009"/&gt; represent a caricature of Judaism and that this interpretation of Paul's criticism is thus flawed by the misunderstanding of the tenets of Judaism.&lt;ref name="gorman_2004"&gt;

|pages=273–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; James Dunn agrees with Sanders' view that Paul would not have criticized Judaism for claiming that salvation comes from adherence to the law or the performance of good works, since those are not tenets of Judaism, but argues against Sanders that Paul's criticism of Judaism represents a rebuttal of the "xenophobic" and ethnocentric form of Judaism to which Paul had previously belonged.&lt;ref name="gorman_2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="horrell_2002"/&gt; Dunn argues that Paul does not see his position as a betrayal of Judaism, but rather represents development of an open Judaism.&lt;ref name="horrell_2002"/&gt; A similar argument is presented by George Smiga, who claims that criticism of Judaism found in the New Testament are best understood as varieties of religious polemic, intended as a call to conversion rather than criticism in the sense of common usage.&lt;ref name="smiga_1992"&gt;

===Regarding the death of Jesus===
{{Main|Jewish deicide|Antisemitic canard}}
The idea that Judaism, and the Jewish people collectively, are responsible for the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|death of Jesus]], often represented in the claim that "Jews killed Jesus", figures prominently in anti-Semitic writings. It was initially stated by [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] in the [[New Testament]] ({{bibleverse|1|Thes.|2:14-15|49}}).&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Roman Catholic church]] formally disavowed its long complicity in anti-Semitism by issuing a [[Nostra Aetate|proclamation]] in 1965 repudiating the notion  that the Jewish people bore any guilt for Jesus's death.

==Criticism from Islam==
A prominent place in the [[Qur'an]]ic polemic against the Jews is given to the conception of the religion of [[Abraham]]. The Qur'an presents Muslims as neither Jews nor Christians but followers of Abraham who was in a physical sense the father of the Jews and the Arabs and lived before the revelation of [[Torah]]. In order to show that the religion practiced by the Jews is not the pure religion of Abraham, the Qur'an mentions the incident of worshiping of the calf, argues that Jews do not believe in part of the revelation given to them, and that their taking of usury shows their worldliness and disobedience of God. Furthermore, the Quran claims they attribute to God what he has not revealed. According to the [[Qur'an]], the Jews exalted a figure named [[Uzair]] as the "son of God" (see the [[Uzair#Quranic statements about perceived Jewish exaltation|Quranic statements about perceived Jewish exaltation]]). The character of [[Ezra]], who was presumed to be the figure mentioned by the Qur'an (albeit with no corroborative evidence to suggest Ezra and Uzair to be the same person) became important in the works of the later Andalusian Muslim scholar [[Ibn Hazm]], who explicitly accused Ezra of being a liar and a heretic who falsified and added interpolations into the Biblical text. In his polemic against Judaism, Ibn Hazm provided a list of what he said were chronological and geographical inaccuracies and contradictions; theological impossibilities (anthropomorphic expressions, stories of fornication and whoredom, and the attributing of sins to prophets), as well as lack of reliable transmission ([[tawatur]]) of the text.&lt;ref name="EoI"&gt;Encyclopedia of Islam, Uzayr&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EoI-Tahrif"&gt;Hava Lazarus-Yafeh, ''Tahrif'', [[Encyclopedia of Islam]]&lt;/ref&gt; Heribert Busse writes "The only explanation is the presumption that Muhammad, in the heat of debate, wanted to accuse the Jews of heretical doctrine on a par with the heresy of the Christian doctrine that teaches the divine nature of Jesus. In doing so, he could take advantage of the high esteem granted Ezra in Judaism."&lt;ref name=Busse1998p57&gt;Busse, Heribert. ''Islam, Judaism, and Christianity: theological and historical affiliations'', Princeton series on the Middle East, Markus Wiener Publishers, 1998, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical criticism==

Philosophical criticism of Judaism is either part of [[criticism of religion|religious criticism]] in general, or specifically focused on aspects unique to the Jewish religion. [[Immanuel Kant]] is an example of the latter. Kant believed that Judaism fails to "satisfy the essential criteria of [a] religion" by requiring external obedience to moral laws, having a secular focus, and lacking a concern for [[Afterlife#Judaism|immortality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0011_0_10705.html|title=Kant, Immanuel|author=[[Manfred H. Vogel]] |publisher=Virtual Jewish Library|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practices==

===Shechitah (Kosher slaughter)===
[[Shechita|Kosher slaughter]] has historically attracted criticism from non-Jews as allegedly being inhumane and unsanitary,&lt;ref name=Shechita-Poland&gt;{{Cite book|title=No way out: the politics of Polish Jewry, 1935–1939|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=co3KJikOaBYC&amp;pg=PA81#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|first=Emanuel|last=Melzer|pages=81–90|year=1997|publisher=Hebrew Union College Press|isbn=0-87820-418-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; in part as an [[antisemitic canard]] that eating ritually slaughtered meat caused degeneration,&lt;ref name=Poliakov&gt;{{Cite book|title=The History of Anti-semitism: From Voltaire to Wagner|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w39m4aohL9gC&amp;pg=PA153#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|first=Léon|last=Poliakov|page=153|year=1968|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-3766-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in part out of economic motivation to remove Jews from the meat industry.&lt;ref name=Shechita-Poland/&gt; Sometimes, however, these criticisms were directed at Judaism as a religion. In 1893, animal advocates campaigning against kosher slaughter in Aberdeen attempted to link cruelty with Jewish religious practice.&lt;ref name=Aberdeen&gt;{{Cite journal|title=A Community on Trial: The Aberdeen Shechita Case, 1893|url=http://www.euppublishing.com/doi/abs/10.3366/jshs.2010.0103|first=Kenneth|last=Collins|journal=[[Journal of Scottish Historical Studies]]|volume=30|page=75|date=November 2010|doi=10.3366/jshs.2010.0103}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1920s, Polish critics of kosher slaughter claimed that the practice actually had no basis in scripture.&lt;ref name=Shechita-Poland/&gt; In contrast, Jewish authorities argue that the slaughter methods are based directly upon ({{bibleverse||Deut.|12:21|HE||}}), and that "these laws are binding on Jews today."&lt;ref name=Chabad2/&gt;

More recently, kosher slaughter has attracted criticism from some groups concerned with [[animal welfare]], who contend that the absence of any form of [[anesthesia]] or stunning prior to the severance of the animal's [[jugular vein]] causes unnecessary pain and suffering. Calls for the abolition of kosher slaughter have been made in 2008 by Germany's federal chamber of veterinarians,&lt;ref name=Germany-Kosher&gt;

Historical records of criticism of religion goes back to at least 5th century BCE in [[ancient Greece]], with [[Diagoras of Melos|Diagoras "the Atheist" of Melos]]. In [[ancient Rome]], an early known example is [[Lucretius]]' ''[[De Rerum Natura]]'' from the 1st century BCE.

In his work ''[[De Rerum Natura]]'', the 1st century [[BCE]] Roman poet [[Titus Lucretius Carus]] wrote: "But 'tis that same religion oftener far / Hath bred the foul impieties of men".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://books.mirror.org/gb.lucretius.html |author=Titus Lucretius Carus |authorlink=Titus Lucretius Carus |title=De Rerum Natura |accessdate=2007-08-05 |work= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630071929/http://books.mirror.org/gb.lucretius.html |archivedate=2007-06-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A philosopher of the [[Epicurean]] school, [[Lucretius]], believed the world was composed solely of matter and void and that all phenomena could be understood as resulting from purely natural causes. Despite believing in Gods, Lucretius, like [[Epicurus]], felt that religion was born of fear and ignorance, and that understanding the natural world would free people of its shackles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.utm.edu/research/iep/l/lucretiu.htm |title=Lucretius (c.99&amp;nbsp;– c.55 BCE) |publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |accessdate=2007-08-05 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stanford - Lucretius"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lucretius – Stanford Encyclopedia|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/|accessdate=19 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was not against religion in and of itself, but against traditional religion which he saw as [[superstition]] for teaching that gods interfered with the world.&lt;ref name="Latin-English: On Nature"&gt;{{cite book|title=On the Nature of Things Translated by W.H.D.

At the beginning of the 16th century, [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] said: "We Italians are irreligious and corrupt above others... because the church and her representatives have set us the worst example".&lt;ref name="{{ISBN|014044534x}}"&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Middlemore, S.

In the 18th century, [[Voltaire]] was a [[deism|deist]] and was strongly critical of religious intolerance. [[Voltaire]] complained about Jews killed by other Jews for worshiping a golden calf and similar actions, he also condemned how Christians killed other Christians over religious differences and how Christians killed [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] for not being [[Baptism|baptised]]. Voltaire claimed the real reason for these killings was that Christians wanted to plunder the wealth of those killed. Voltaire was also critical of [[Muslim]] intolerance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.hanover.edu/texts/voltaire/volrelig.html|title=Voltaire's Philosophical Dictionary|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in the 18th century, [[David Hume]] criticised [[teleological argument]]s for religion. Hume claimed that natural explanations for the order in the [[universe]] were reasonable, see [[David Hume#Design argument|design argument]]. An important aim of Hume's writings was demonstrating the unsoundness of the philosophical basis for religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume-religion/|title=Hume on Religion|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their books and articles have spawned debate in multiple fields of inquiry and are heavily quoted in popular media (online forums, [[YouTube]], television and popular philosophy). In ''[[The End of Faith]]'', philosopher [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] focuses on violence among other toxic qualities of religion. In ''[[Breaking the Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon|Breaking the Spell]]'', philosopher [[Daniel Dennett]] focuses on the question of "why we believe strange things". In ''[[The God Delusion]]'', biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] covers almost every facet of religion injecting both snarky irony and humor. In ''[[God Is Not Great]]'', journalist and polemicist [[Christopher Hitchens]] focused on how religious forces attacks human dignity and the corruption of religious organizations. In the ''Oxford Handbook of Atheism'', according to Thomas Zenc the four books were published during a time of intense debate on political, religious and sociological questions. The works share many common themes yet notably differ in scope, style and content. While according to Zenc the beginnings of a broader narrative ([[New Atheism]]) seems to have emerged it does not, stand up to the full definition of a movement.&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford Handbook on Atheism.

===Response to general criticism of religion in an historical context===

{{Main|Religion|Definition of religion}}

Today, religion is broadly conceived as an abstraction which entails beliefs, doctrines and sacred places—even though the ancient and medieval cultures that produced [[religious text]]s, like the [[Bible]] or the [[Quran]], did not have such conceptions or ideas in their languages, cultures, or histories.&lt;ref name="Nongbri"/&gt;&lt;ref name="50 myths"/&gt; However, there is still no scholarly consensus over what a religion is.&lt;ref name="Fitzgerald"&gt;{{Cite book|ref= harv|first= Timothy|last= Fitzgerald|title= Discourse on Civility and Barbarity|publisher= Oxford University Press|year= 2007|pages= 45–46 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=b67p1VdF_OoC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nongbri" /&gt;&lt;ref name="50 myths" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dubuisson"/&gt;

Before the 17th century religion was conflated with every day life. [[Religion]] as a modern Western concept developed from the 17th century onwards.&lt;ref name="50 myths"&gt;{{cite book|last1= Morreall|first1= John|last2= Sonn|first2= Tamara|title= 50 Great Myths of Religion|chapter= Myth 1: All Societies Have Religions|date= 2013|publisher= Wiley-Blackwell|isbn= 9780470673508|pages= 12–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nongbri&gt;{{cite book|last1= Nongbri|first1= Brent|title= Before Religion: A History of a Modern Concept|date= 2013|publisher= Yale University Press|isbn= 030015416X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories"&gt;{{cite book|last1= Harrison|first1= Peter|title= The Territories of Science and Religion|date= 2015|publisher= University of Chicago Press|isbn= 022618448X | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=WLvnBgAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dubuisson&gt;{{cite book|first1= Daniel|last1= Dubuisson|title= The Western Construction of Religion : Myths, Knowledge, and Ideology|date= 2007|publisher= Johns Hopkins University Press|location= Baltimore, Md.|isbn= 0801887569 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=kyl5K2TV8zMC}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in Asia, no one before the 19th century self-identified as a "Hindu" or other similar identities.&lt;ref name="50 myths"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Invention Japan"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Josephson|first1=Jason Ananda|title=The Invention of Religion in Japan|pages=11–12|date=2012|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=0226412342}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="50 myths"/&gt;

With the existence of diverse modern categories of religion such as [[monotheism]], [[polytheism]], [[pantheism]], [[Nontheistic religions|nontheism]] and diverse specific religions such as [[Christianity]], [[Judaism]], [[Islam]], [[Taoism]], [[Buddhism]] and many others, it is not always clear to whom the criticisms are aimed at or to what extent they are applicable to other religions.

Dennett and Harris have asserted that theist religions and their scriptures are not divinely inspired, but man made to fulfill [[society|social]], [[biological]] and [[political]] needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=[[Breaking the Spell: Religion as a Natural Phenomenon|Breaking the Spell]]|publisher=Allen Lane|year=2006|isbn=0-7139-9789-3|first=Daniel|last=Dennett|authorlink=Daniel Dennett}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=[[The End of Faith]]|publisher=W.

===Narratives to provide comfort and meaning===
[[David Hume]] argued that religion developed as a source of comfort in the face of the adversity, not as an honest grappling with verifiable truth. Religion is therefore an unsophisticated form of reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;Bashevkin, Dovid.  [http://www.thelehrhaus.com/timely-thoughts/2016/9/29/jonah-and-the-varieties-of-religious-motivation-a-religious-educators-perspective-on-why-people-become-religious "Jonah and the Varieties of Religious Motivation."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161012155807/http://www.thelehrhaus.com/timely-thoughts/2016/9/29/jonah-and-the-varieties-of-religious-motivation-a-religious-educators-perspective-on-why-people-become-religious |date=2016-10-12 }} ''Lehrhaus''.  9 October 2016.  2 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Daniel Dennett]] has argued that, with the exception of more modern religions such as [[Raëlism]], [[Mormonism]], [[Scientology]] and the [[Bahá'í Faith]], most religions were formulated at a time when the origin of life, the workings of the body, and the nature of the stars and planets were poorly understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Dennett, Daniel Clement |title=Breaking the Spell : Religion as a Natural Phenomenon |publisher=Viking Adult |location= |year= 2006|isbn=0-670-03472-X |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These narratives were intended to give solace and a sense of relationship with larger forces. As such, they may have served several important functions in ancient societies. Examples include the views many religions traditionally had towards solar and lunar [[eclipse]]s and the appearance of [[comet]]s (forms of [[astrology]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title =When solar fears eclipse reason | work = | publisher =BBC News | date =2006-03-28 | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4852690.stm | doi = | accessdate=2010-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Comets in Ancient Cultures | work = | publisher =NASA | url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/deepimpact/media/f_ancient.html | doi = | accessdate =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Given current understanding of the physical world, where human knowledge has increased dramatically, Dawkins and French atheist philosopher [[Michel Onfray]] contend that continuing to hold on to these belief systems is irrational and no longer useful.&lt;ref name="The God Delusion" /&gt;&lt;ref name="{{ISBN|1-55970-820-4}}"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Onfray, Michel |authorlink=Michel Onfray |title=Atheist Manifesto: The Case Against Christianity, Judaism, and Islam |publisher=Arcade Publishing |location= |year= 2007|isbn=1-55970-820-4 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Opium of the people====
[[File:Karl Marx 001.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Karl Marx]]]]
{{quote|Religious suffering is, at the same time, the expression of real suffering and a protest against real suffering. Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the [[opium of the people]].|[[Karl Marx]]&lt;ref name="critright"/&gt;}}
According to [[Karl Marx]], the father of "[[scientific socialism]]", religion is a tool used by the [[ruling class]]es whereby the masses can shortly relieve their suffering via the act of experiencing religious emotions. It is in the interest of the ruling classes to instill in the masses the religious conviction that their current suffering will lead to eventual happiness. Therefore, as long as the public believes in religion, they will not attempt to make any genuine effort to understand and overcome the real source of their suffering, which in Marx's opinion was their [[capitalist]] economic system. In this perspective, Marx saw religion as [[escapism]].&lt;ref name="critright"&gt;{{Cite book| last =Marx | first =Karl | authorlink =Karl Marx |chapter=Introduction | title = A Contribution to the Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right | publisher =Deutsch-Französische Jahrbücher |date=February 1844 | location = | url =http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1843/critique-hpr/intro.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marx also viewed the Christian doctrine of [[original sin]] as being deeply [[anti-social behaviour|anti-social]] in character. Original sin, he argued, convinces people that the source of their misery lies in the inherent and unchangeable "sinfulness" of humanity rather than in the forms of social organization and institutions, which Marx argued can be changed through the application of collective social planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last =Marx | first =Karl | authorlink =Karl Marx | title =Das Kapital | publisher = | year =1867 | location =  | url =http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch26.htm | doi = | id = | nopp =true| page =Volume 1, Part VIII  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Viruses of the mind===
[[File:Richard dawkins lecture.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Richard Dawkins]], author of ''[[The God Delusion]]'']]
In his 1976 book ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'', [[Richard Dawkins]] coined the term [[memes]] to describe informational units that can be transmitted culturally, analogous to genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last =Dawkins | first =Richard | title =[[The Selfish Gene]], 30th Anniversary edition  | publisher =  | year =2006 | location = | url =  | doi =  | id =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; He later used this concept in the essay "[[Viruses of the Mind]]" to explain the persistence of religious ideas in human culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Dawkins | first =Richard | title =Viruses of the Mind | work = | publisher = | year =1991 | url =http://cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/Dawkins/viruses-of-the-mind.html | doi = | accessdate =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Response to virus of the mind criticism====

Both the religious and non religious are critical of Dawkin's meme theory which has mostly been abandoned. [[John Bowker (theologian)|John Bowker]] criticized the idea that "God" and "Faith" are viruses of the mind, suggesting that Dawkins' "account of religious motivation [...] is [...] far removed from evidence and data" that it is unreasonable to extract certain behaviours solely through religious memes.&lt;ref&gt;In his 1992–93 [[Gresham College]] lectures, written in collaboration with the psychiatrist Quinton Deeley and published as ''Is God a Virus?'', SPCK, 1995, 274 pp. The quotes here come from p.73.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alister McGrath]] has responded by arguing that "memes have no place in serious scientific reflection",&lt;ref&gt;''Dawkins's God: Genes, Memes and the Meaning of Life'', p.125, quoting [[Simon Conway Morris]] in support&lt;/ref&gt; that there is strong evidence that such ideas are not spread by random processes, but by deliberate intentional actions,&lt;ref&gt;''Dawkins's God: Genes, Memes and the Meaning of Life'', p.126&lt;/ref&gt; that "evolution" of ideas is more [[Lamarckism|Lamarckian]] than [[Darwinian]]&lt;ref&gt;''Dawkins's God: Genes, Memes and the Meaning of Life'', p.127&lt;/ref&gt; and that there is no evidence (and certainly none in the essay) that epidemiological models usefully explain the spread of religious ideas.&lt;ref&gt;''Dawkins's God: Genes, Memes and the Meaning of Life'' pp.137–138&lt;/ref&gt; McGrath also points out that it is surveys in the United States report a high life satisfaction rate among the religious is not comparable with a virus.&lt;ref&gt;''Dawkins's God: Genes, Memes and the Meaning of Life'', p.136, citing [[Harold G. Koenig|Koenig]] and Cohen, ''The Link between Religion and Health'', OUP, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his research recent brain imaging of religious subjects praying or meditating show identical activity in the respective human section of the brain which [[Ramachandran]] calls God-spots.

In [[Michael Shermer]]'s book ''Why People Believe Strange Things'' he theorizes on how emerging mankind imposed made-up explanations and bizarre rituals for natural phenomena they didn't and couldn't understand.

Philosopher [[Auguste Comte]] posited that many societal constructs pass through [[Law of three stages|three stages]] and that religion corresponds to the two earlier, or more primitive stages by stating: "From the study of the development of human intelligence, in all directions, and through all times, the discovery arises of a great fundamental law, to which it is necessarily subject, and which has a solid foundation of proof, both in the facts of our organization and in our historical experience. The law is this: that each of our leading conceptions – each branch of our knowledge – passes successively through three different theoretical conditions: the theological, or fictitious; the metaphysical, or abstract; and the scientific, or positive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Comte|first=Auguste|title=Course of Positive Philosophy (1830)|url=http://www.historyguide.org/intellect/comte_cpp.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Response to criticism===

In his book ''[[Is Religion Dangerous?]]'', [[Keith Ward]] notes that not all false opinions are delusions and that belief in God is different as many great minds and people who live ordinary lives and believe in God are not irrational people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last =Ward | first =Keith | authorlink =Keith Ward | title =Is Religion Dangerous? | publisher = Lion| year =2006 | location =London:Lion Hudson Plc | url = | doi = | isbn = 978-0-7459-5262-8 | page =172 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hyperreligiosity or even "intensely professed atheism" can emerge from emotional disturbances involving temporal lobe epilepsy.&lt;ref name="Heilman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heilman|first1=Kenneth M.|last2=Valenstein|first2=Edward |title=Clinical Neuropsychology|date=13 October 2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|language=English|isbn=9780195384871|page=488|quote=Studies that claim to show no difference in emotional makeup between temporal lobe and other epileptic patients (Guerrant et. al., 1962; Stevens, 1966) have been reinterpreted (Blumer, 1975) to indicate that there is, in fact, a difference: those with temporal lobe epilepsy are more likely to have more serious forms of emotional disturbance. This typical personality of temporal lobe epileptic patient has been described in roughly similar terms over many years (Blumer &amp; Benson, 1975; Geschwind, 1975, 1977; Blumer, 1999; Devinsky &amp; Schachter, 2009). These patients are said to have a deepening of emotions; they ascribe great significance to commonplace events. This can be manifested as a tendency to take a cosmic view; hyperreligiosity (or intensely professed atheism) is said to be common.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Harm to individuals==
Some have criticized the effects of adherence to dangerous practices such as self-sacrifice.&lt;ref name="self-sacrifice"&gt;Branden, N. (1963), "Mental Health versus Mysticism and Self-Sacrifice," Ayn Rand – The Virtue of Selfishness: A New Concept of Egoism.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jerusalem syndrome===
{{Main|Jerusalem syndrome}}
Jerusalem has loaned its name to a unique psychological phenomenon where Jewish or Christian individuals who develop obsessive religious themed ideas or delusions (sometimes believing themselves to be Jesus Christ or another prophet) will feel compelled to travel to Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jerusalem Syndrome: Jewish Virtual Library|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/jersynd.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jerusalem Syndrome|url=http://savvytraveler.publicradio.org/show/features/2000/20000603/jerusalem.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of these, 470 were admitted to hospital. On average, 100 such tourists have been seen annually, 40 of them requiring admission to hospital. About 2 million tourists visit Jerusalem each year.

===Honor killings and stoning===
{{Main|Honor killings|stoning}}
Honor killings once well known in the Western are now extremely rare however they still occur in other parts of the world. An honor is when a person is killed by family for bringing [[honour|dishonor]] or [[shame]] upon the family.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/honourcrimes/crimesofhonour_1.shtml#h3 |title=Ethics - Honour crimes |publisher=BBC |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2013-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stoning is a form of capital punishment whereby a group throws stones at a person until death ensues. As of September 2010, stoning is a punishment that is included in the laws in some countries including Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Yemen, the United Arab Emirates, and some states in Nigeria&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Handley|first=Paul|title=Islamic countries under pressure over stoning|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5ixvYN7oeF8ehN9beAHZ4G_YlfKeA|accessdate=22 April 2011|newspaper=AFP|date=11 Sep 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; as punishment for [[Zina|zina al-mohsena]] ("adultery of married persons").&lt;ref name=FAQ&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions about Stoning|url=http://www.violenceisnotourculture.org/faq_stoning|publisher=violence is not our culture|accessdate=14 May 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129025158/http://www.violenceisnotourculture.org/faq_stoning|archive-date=2014-11-29|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While stoning may not be codified in the laws of Afghanistan and Somalia, both countries have seen several incidents of stoning to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sommerville|first=Quentin|title=Afghan police pledge justice for Taliban stoning|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-12292917|accessdate=22 April 2011|newspaper=BBC|date=26 Jan 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nebehay|first=Stephanie|title=Pillay accuses Somali rebels of possible war crimes|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2009/07/10/idINIndia-40950620090710|accessdate=22 April 2011|newspaper=Times of India|date=10 Jul 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the early 2000s, stoning was a legal form of [[capital punishment]] in Iran.  In 2002, the Iranian judiciary officially placed a moratorium on stoning.&lt;ref name=BBC312&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6288156.stm |title=Iran 'adulterer' stoned to death |date=10 July 2007 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=3 December 2012 |archivedate=4 December 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Cf5UEbg5?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6288156.stm |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, judiciary spokesman [[Jamal Karimirad]] stated that "in the Islamic republic, we do not see such punishments being carried out", further adding that if stoning sentences were passed by lower courts, they were overruled by higher courts and "no such verdicts have been carried out".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4166137.stm |title=Iran denies execution by stoning |publisher=BBC News |date=11 January 2005 |accessdate=2010-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the judiciary decided to fully scrap the punishment from the books in legislation submitted to parliament for approval.&lt;ref name="afp.google.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iZ7aTbPW-vzYtgdxmx1O5Iok-CMQ |title=Iran to scrap death by stoning |publisher=[[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] |date=August 6, 2008 |accessdate=September 23, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101010081413/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5iZ7aTbPW-vzYtgdxmx1O5Iok-CMQ |archivedate=October 10, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2013, Iranian parliament published official report about excluding stoning from penal code and it accused Western media for spreading "noisy propaganda" about the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rc.majlis.ir/fa/news/show/831790|title="سنگسار" در شرع حذف شدنی نیست|website=مرکز پژوهش ها}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genital modification and mutilation===
According to the [[World Health Organization]], female [[genital modification and mutilation|genital mutilation]] has no health benefits and is a violation of basic human rights. Though no first tier religious texts prescribe the practice, some practitioners do believe there is religious support for it. While it is mostly found in Muslim countries it is also practiced by some Christian and Animist countries mostly in Africa. GFA is not widely practiced in some Muslim countries making it difficult to separate religion from culture. Some religious leaders promote it, some consider it irrelevant to religion, and others contribute to its elimination". The practice is illegal in all Western countries and it is also illegal to transport a girl to another country to carry out FGM. Multiple parents have been charged for committing this crime in the United Kingdom with those charged being exclusively from Muslim countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs241/en/|title=Female genital mutilation|website=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Male circumcision is a cost effective way for disease prevention and helps reduce medical costs overall.&lt;ref name="male circumcision"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Morris |first1=Brian J. |last2=Bailis |first2=Stefan A. |last3=Wiswell |first3=Thomas E. |title=Circumcision Rates in the United States: Rising or Falling?

As such, some have argued that failure to circumcise a baby boy may be unethical because it diminishes his right to good health.&lt;ref name="male circumcision" /&gt;

===Counterarguments to religion as harmful to individuals===
A metareview of 850 research papers on Religion in the [[United States]] concluded that "the majority of well-conducted studies found that higher levels of religious involvement are positively associated with indicators of psychological well-being ([[life satisfaction]], happiness, positive affect and higher morale and with lower rates of depression, suicidal thoughts and behavior and drug/alcohol use/abuse".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  | doi = 10.1590/S1516-44462006005000006  | last1= Moreira-Almeida | first1 = Alexander | first2 = Francisco Lotufo |last2=Neto | last3= Koenig |first3= Harold G. | authorlink3=Harold G.

A cross-national investigation on subjective [[well-being]] has noted that, globally, religious people are usually happier than nonreligious people, though nonreligious people also reach high levels of happiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=International Differences in Well-Being|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-973273-9|pages=378–385|author=Ronald Inglehart|editor= Diener, John F. |editor2=Helliwell, Daniel Kahneman|chapter=Faith and Freedom: Traditional and Modern Ways to Happiness}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify source|date=July 2018}}

Despite [[honor killings]] occurring in multiple cultures and religions [[Islam]] is frequently blamed for their institution and persistence. Professor Tahira Shaid Khan notes that there is nothing in the [[Qur'an]] that permits or sanctions [[honor killings]].&lt;ref name=r1&gt;Hilary Mantell [http://www.unl.edu/rhames/courses/212/readings/honor-kil-ng.pdf Thousands of Women Killed for Family "Honor"]. National Geographic News. February 12, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; attributes it to broader attitudes that view women as property with no rights as the explanation for honor killings.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt; Khan also argues that this view results in [[violence against women]] and their being turned "into a commodity which can be exchanged, bought and sold".&lt;ref name="Sanctuary For Families"&gt;{{cite web|title=International Domestic Violence Issues |url=http://www.sanctuaryforfamilies.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=252&amp;Itemid=259 |publisher=Sanctuary For Families |accessdate=2011-12-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016194204/http://www.sanctuaryforfamilies.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=252&amp;Itemid=259 |archivedate=2014-10-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Harm to society==
Some aspects of religion are criticized on the basis that they damage society as a whole. [[Steven Weinberg]], for example, states it takes religion to make good people do evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physlink.com/Education/essay_weinberg.cfm|title=A Designer Universe?|last=Weinberg|first=Steven|date=April 1999|work=PhysLink.com|accessdate=2010-02-22|location=Washington, D.C.|quote= With or without religion, good people can behave well and bad people can do evil; but for good people to do evil — that takes religion.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Richard Dawkins]] cite religiously inspired or justified violence, resistance to social change, attacks on [[science]], repression of women and [[homophobia]].&lt;ref name="Russell"&gt;{{cite web| last=Russell| first=Bertrand| url=http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/russell2.htm| title=''Has Religion Made Useful Contributions to Civilization?''| accessdate=2009-10-23| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090724090115/http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/russell2.htm| archivedate=2009-07-24| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hartung has claimed that major religious moral codes can lead to "us vs. them" group [[wikt:solidarity|solidarity]] and mentality which can dehumanise or [[Demonization|demonise]] individuals outside their group as "not fully human", or less worthy.

[[John William Draper]] and [[Andrew Dickson White]], authors of the [[conflict thesis]], have argued that when a religion offers a complete set of answers to the problems of purpose, [[morality]], origins, or science, it often discourages exploration of those areas by suppressing curiosity, denies its followers a broader perspective and can prevent social, moral and scientific progress.

==Morality==
{{See also|Human sacrifice|Morality and religion|Religious intolerance}}
[[Richard Dawkins]] contends that [[Theism|theistic religions]] devalue human compassion and morality. In his view, the [[Bible]] contains many injunctions against following one's conscience over scripture and positive actions are supposed to originate not from compassion, but from the fear of punishment.&lt;ref name="The God Delusion" /&gt; [[Albert Einstein]] stated that no religious basis is needed in order to display ethical behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Religion and Science| last=Einstein| first=Albert| newspaper=New York Times Magazine| date=1930-11-09|quote=A man's ethical behavior should be based effectually on sympathy, education, and social ties; no religious basis is necessary. Man would indeed be in a poor way if he had to be restrained by fear of punishment and hope of reward after death.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Survey research suggests that believers do tend to hold different views than non-believers on a variety of social, ethical and moral questions. According to a 2003 survey conducted in the United States by [[The Barna Group]], those who described themselves as believers were less likely than those describing themselves as atheists or agnostics to consider the following behaviors morally acceptable: [[cohabitation|cohabitating]] with someone of the opposite sex outside of marriage, enjoying sexual fantasies, having an [[abortion]], sexual relationships outside of marriage, [[gambling]], consuming [[marijuana]], looking at [[pornography|pictures of nudity or explicit sexual behavior]], getting [[drunkeness|drunk]] and "[[homosexuality|having a sexual relationship with someone of the same sex]]".&lt;ref name="Morality Continues to Decay"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040203202833/http://www.barna.org/cgi-bin/PagePressRelease.asp?PressReleaseID=152&amp;Reference=F "The Barna Update: Morality Continues to Decay" (archive copy at the [[Internet Archive]])], [[The Barna Group]], November 3, 2003 ([http://www.barna.org/barna-update/article/5-barna-update/129-morality-continues-to-decay "The Barna Update: Morality Continues to Decay" – Summary version posted on the Barna website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224045707/https://www.barna.org/barna-update/article/5-barna-update/129-morality-continues-to-decay |date=2013-12-24 }})&lt;/ref&gt;

===Children===
{{See also|Indoctrination|Mind control|Religion and children|Child marriage}}
In the 19th century, philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] argued that teaching some ideas to children at a young age could foster resistance to doubting those ideas later on.&lt;ref&gt;"And as the capacity for believing is strongest in childhood, special care is taken to make sure of this tender age. This has much more to do with the doctrines of belief taking root than threats and reports of miracles. If, in early childhood, certain fundamental views and doctrines are paraded with unusual solemnity, and an air of the greatest earnestness never before visible in anything else; if, at the same time, the possibility of a doubt about them be completely passed over, or touched upon only to indicate that doubt is the first step to eternal perdition, the resulting impression will be so deep that, as a rule, that is, in almost every case, doubt about them will be almost as impossible as doubt about one's own existence."- Arthur Schopenhauer -''On Religion: A Dialogue''&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Homosexuality and religion}}

[[Homosexuality]] is unambiguously condemned in [[Abrahamic religions]] where prohibition and execution of those who engage in male homosexual activity are found in the Old testament of the bible and in the Koran. Homosexuals are also condemned in the New Testament several times but without obligatory punishment. In the United States, conservative [[Christian right]] groups such as the [[Christian Legal Society]] and the [[Alliance Defense Fund]] have filed numerous lawsuits against public universities, aimed at overturning policies that protect homosexuals from discrimination and [[hate speech]]. These groups argue that such policies infringe their [[Freedom of religion|right to freely exercise religion]] as guaranteed by the [[Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment]] of the [[United States Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Simon |first=Stephanie |title=Christians Sue for Right Not to Tolerate Policies |work= |publisher=Los Angeles Times |date=10 April 2006 | url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/1018310011.html?dids=1018310011:1018310011&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Apr+10%2C+2006&amp;author=Stephanie+Simon&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=A.1&amp;desc=Christians+Sue+for+Right+Not+to+Tolerate+Policies |accessdate=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most secularised Christian countries have legalised homosexual activity and several have legalised [[same-sex marriage]]. However, not all historically Christian countries have done so such as [[Russia]] and [[Uganda]] which have introduces discriminatory laws ranging from anti-propaganda laws to corporal punishment. Homosexuality is still illegal in most [[Muslim world|Muslim countries]] and several of these countries impose the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]] for homosexual behavior. In July 2005, [[Mahmoud Asgari and Ayaz Marhoni|two Iranian men]] aged sixteen and eighteen were, supposedly, hanged for homosexuality, causing an international outcry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last=Eke |first=Steven |title=Iran 'must stop youth executions' |wor = |language= |publisher=BBC News |date=28 July 2005 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4725959.stm |accessdate=2010-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In line with other findings suggesting that religious humanitarianism is largely directed at in-group members, greater religious identification, greater extrinsic religiosity and greater religious fundamentalism were associated with racial prejudice.  This is congruent with the fact that 50% of religious congregations in the US are [[Racial segregation|racially segregated]], and only 12% have a degree of diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hall|first1=Deborah L.|last2=Matz|first2=David C.|last3=Wood|first3=Wendy|title=Why Don’t We Practice What We Preach?

Religion has been used by some as justification for advocating [[racism]]. The [[Christian Identity]] movement has been associated with racism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Berlet |first = Chip |authorlink = Chip Berlet |year = 2004 |url = http://www.publiceye.org/rightist/idennlns.html |title = A New Face for Racism &amp; Fascism  |work = White Supremacist, Antisemitic, and Race Hate Groups in the U.S.: A Genealogy |publisher = Political Research Associates   |accessdate = 2007-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are arguments that these positions may be as much reflections of contemporary social views as of what has been called [[scientific racism]].&lt;ref&gt;"Ostensibly scientific": cf. Adam Kuper, Jessica Kuper (eds.), ''The social science encyclopedia'' (1996), "Racism", p. 716: "This [''sc. scientific''] racism entailed the use of 'scientific techniques', to sanction the belief in European and American racial superiority"; ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Questions to sociobiology'' (1998), "Race, theories of", p. 18: "Its exponents [''sc. of scientific racism''] tended to equate race with species and claimed that it constituted a scientific explanation of human history"; Terry Jay Ellingson, ''The myth of the noble savage'' (2001), 147ff. "In scientific racism, the racism was never very scientific; nor, it could at least be argued, was whatever met the qualifications of actual science ever very racist" (p. 151); Paul A. Erickson, Liam D. Murphy, ''A History of Anthropological Theory'' (2008), p. 152: "Scientific racism: Improper or incorrect science that actively or passively supports racism".&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] had [[Black people and Mormonism|excluded African Americans]] from the [[Priesthood (LDS Church)|priesthood]] from 1860 to 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=One Nation Under Gods: A History of the Mormon Church|year=2002|first=Richard|last=Abanes|authorlink=Richard Abanes|isbn=1-56858-219-6|publisher=Four Walls Eight Windows}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most [[Mormon fundamentalism|fundamentalist Mormon]] [[List of sects in the Latter Day Saint movement|sects]] within the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], rejected the Church's 1978 decision to allow African Americans to hold the priesthood and continue to deny activity in the church due to race.&lt;ref name="Primergroups"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Primer, Helping Victims of Domestic Violence and Child Abuse in Polygamous Communities: Fundamentalist Mormon Communities |url=http://attorneygeneral.utah.gov/cmsdocuments/The_Primer.pdf |publisher=Utah Attorney General's Office and Arizona Attorney General's Office |accessdate=29 June 2010 |date=June 2006 |page=41 |format=PDF |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

===Women===

[[File:Woman walking in Afghanistan.jpg|thumb|A woman with burqa on walking by the road in northern Afghanistan]]

The content of the [[Religious text|holy books]] of [[Abrahamic religions]] contain severe restrictions on the rights of women ranging from prohibiting women from certain behaviour and activities to requiring women to submit to the will of their father and or husband.

According to [[Polly Toynbee]], religion interferes with [[bodily autonomy]] for both genders and fosters particularly negative attitudes towards women's bodies. Toynbee writes: "Women's bodies are always the issue - too unclean to be bishops, and dangerous enough to be covered up by Islam and mikvahed by Judaism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/oct/26/comment.politics|title=Polly Toynbee: A woman's supreme right over her own body and destiny is in jeopardy - Comment is free - The Guardian|author=Polly Toynbee|work=the Guardian|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is argued that religious sexual discrimination leads to unequal relations in [[marriage]], creating norms which subordinate the wife to the husband. The word [[Wiktionary:בעל|בעל]] (''ba`al''), Hebrew for "husband", used throughout the Bible, is synonymous with "owner" and "master".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.questia.com/library/90607132/religion-and-sexism-images-of-woman-in-the-jewish|title=Religion and Sexism: Images of Woman in the Jewish and Christian Traditions|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This mirrors the abrahamic view of God as an omnipotent, perfect power, where this power is one of domination, which is persistently associated with the characteristics of ideal [[masculinity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminist-religion/#toc|title=Feminist Philosophy of Religion|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sheila Jeffreys]] argues: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Religion gives authority to traditional, patriarchal beliefs about the essentially subordinate nature of women and their naturally separate roles, such as the need for women to be confined to the private world of the home and family, that women should be obedient to their husbands, that women's sexuality should be modest and under the control of their menfolk, and that women should not use contraception or abortion to limit their childbearing. The practice of such ancient beliefs interferes profoundly with women's abilities to exercise their human rights".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/search?q=Man%27s+Dominion%3A+The+Rise+of+Religion+and+the+Eclipse+of+Women%27s+Rights&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1|title=Man's Dominion: The Rise of Religion and the Eclipse of Women's Rights - Google Search|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Islam====
[[Feminism|Feminist]] [[Julie Bindel]] argues that religions encourage the domination of men over women and that Islam promotes the submission of women to their husbands and encourages practices such as [[child marriage]]. She wrote that religion "promotes inequality between men and women", that Islam's message for a woman includes that "she will be subservient to her husband and devote her life to pleasing him" and that "Islam's obsession with virginity and childbirth has led to gender segregation and early marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://standpointmag.co.uk/features-may-10-why-do-western-women-convert-julie-bindel-islam-female-conversion|title=Why do Western Women Convert? - Standpoint|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Islamic laws]] have been criticized by human rights organizations for exposing women to mistreatment and violence, preventing women from reporting rape and contributing to the discrimination of women.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/afghanistan0312webwcover_0.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Nations]] say that Islam is used to justify unnecessary and harmful [[female genital mutilation]], when the purposes range from deprivation of sexual satisfaction to discourage [[adultery]], insuring virginity to their husbands, or generating appearance of virginity.&lt;ref name="unfpa.org"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.unfpa.org/public/News/pid/280 | title=Statement on the International Day Against Female Genital Mutilation | first=Thoraya |last=Ahmed Obaid | publisher = [[United Nations Population Fund]] (UNFPA) | date=6 February 2007 | accessdate=2008-02-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maryam Namazie]] argues that women are victimized under [[Sharia law]], both in criminal matters (such as punishment for improper veiling) and in civil matters; and also that women have judicial hurdles that are lenient or advantageous for men.&lt;ref name="onelawforall.org.uk"&gt;http://www.onelawforall.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/New-Report-Sharia-Law-in-Britain_fixed.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Phyllis Chesler]], Islam is connected to violence against women, especially in the form of honor killings. She rejects the argument that honor killings are not related to Islam and claims that while fundamentalists of all religions place restrictions on women, in Islam not only are these restrictions harsher, but Islam also reacts more violently when these rules are broken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meforum.org/2067/are-honor-killings-simply-domestic-violence|title=Are Honor Killings Simply Domestic Violence?|work=Middle East Forum|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Christianity====

Christianity has been criticized for painting women as sinful, untrustful, deceiving and desiring to seduce and incite men into sexual sin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/2030628/The_Christian_Mens_Oldest_Prejudice_Misogyny_Hate_Or_Fear|title=The Christian Men's Oldest Prejudice: Misogyny, Hate Or Fear?|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Katharine M. Rogers argues that Christianity is misogynistic and that the "dread of female [[seduction]]" can be found in St. Paul's epistles.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Katharine M. ''The Troublesome Helpmate: A History of Misogyny in Literature,'' 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; K. K. Ruthven argues that the "legacy of Christian misogyny was consolidated by the so-called 'Fathers' of the Church, like [[Tertullian]], who thought a woman was not only 'the gateway of the devil' but also 'a temple built over a sewer'".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/?id=clOT7Hg2CfAC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;dq=christian+misogyny#v=onepage&amp;q=christian%20misogyny&amp;f=false | title = Feminist literary studies: An introduction | isbn = 978-0-521-39852-7 | author1 = Ruthven | first1 = K. K | year = 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jack Holland argues the concept of [[fall of man]] is misogynistic as "a myth that blames woman for the ills and sufferings of mankind".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Holland|first=Jack|title=Misogyny: The World's Oldest Prejudice|year=2006|publisher=Carroll &amp; Graf|location=New York|isbn=0-7867-1823-4|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian religious figures have been involved in the Middle Ages and early modern period [[Witch-hunt|witch trials]], which were generally used to punish assertive or independent women such as [[midwife|midwives]] since [[witchcraft]] was often not in evidence,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Teijlingen |first= Edwin R.| title=Midwifery and the medicalization of childbirth: comparative perspectives|year=2004|publisher=Nova Publishers|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[activists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Eller|first=Cynthia|title=Living in the lap of the Goddess: the feminist spirituality movement in America|year=1995|publisher=Beacon Press|pages=170–175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Shechita.JPG|thumb|180px|[[Shechita]] slaughter of a chicken]]
[[Shechita|Kosher slaughter]] has historically attracted criticism from non-Jews as allegedly being inhumane and unsanitary,&lt;ref name="Shechita-Poland"&gt;{{Cite book|title=No way out: the politics of Polish Jewry, 1935–1939|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=co3KJikOaBYC&amp;pg=PA81#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|first=Emanuel|last=Melzer|pages=81–90|year=1997|publisher=Hebrew Union College Press|isbn=0-87820-418-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; in part as an [[antisemitic canard]] that eating ritually slaughtered meat caused degeneration&lt;ref name=Poliakov&gt;{{Cite book|title=The History of Anti-semitism: From Voltaire to Wagner|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w39m4aohL9gC&amp;pg=PA153#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|first=Léon|last=Poliakov|page=153|year=1968|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-3766-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in part out of economic motivation to remove Jews from the meat industry.&lt;ref name="Shechita-Poland"/&gt; Sometimes these criticisms were directed at Judaism as a religion. In 1893, animal advocates campaigning against kosher slaughter in Aberdeen attempted to link cruelty with Jewish religious practice.&lt;ref name=Aberdeen&gt;{{Cite journal|title=A Community on Trial: The Aberdeen Shechita Case, 1893|url=http://www.euppublishing.com/doi/abs/10.3366/jshs.2010.0103|first=Kenneth|last=Collins|journal=[[Journal of Scottish Historical Studies]]|volume=30|pages=75–92|date=November 2010|doi=10.3366/jshs.2010.0103}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1920s, Polish critics of kosher slaughter claimed that the practice actually had no basis in Scripture.&lt;ref name="Shechita-Poland"/&gt; In contrast, Jewish authorities argue that the slaughter methods are based directly upon Genesis IX:3 and that "these laws are binding on Jews today".&lt;ref name=Chabad2/&gt;

While supporters of [[Shechita|kosher slaughter]] counter that [[Judaism]] requires the practice precisely because it is considered humane,&lt;ref name="Chabad2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/222241/jewish/Why-Do-Jews-Practice-Shechita.htm|title=Why Do Jews Practice Shechita?|author=Shechita UK|work=Chabad.org|publisher=Chabad-Lubavitch Media Center|accessdate=2012-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research conducted by [[Temple Grandin]] and Joe M. Regenstein in 1994 concluded that—practiced correctly with proper restraint systems—kosher slaughter results in little pain and suffering and notes that behavioral reactions to the incision made during kosher slaughter are less than those to noises such as clanging or hissing, inversion or pressure during restraint.&lt;ref name="Grandin"&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Temple |last1=Grandin |first2=Joe M. |last2=Regenstein|date=March 1994|title=Religious slaughter and animal welfare: a discussion for meat scientists.|journal=Meat Focus International|publisher=CAB International|pages=115–123|url=http://grandin.com/ritual/kosher.slaugh.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; those who practice and subscribe religiously and philosophically to [[Jewish vegetarianism]] disagree, stating that such slaughter is not required while a number, including medieval scholars of [[Judaism]] such as [[Joseph Albo]] and [[Isaac Arama]], regard vegetarianism as a moral [[ideal (ethics)|ideal]], not just out of a concern for [[animal welfare]], but also the slaughterer.&lt;ref name="innernet1"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.innernet.org.il/article.php?aid=107 |title=Contemporary Halakhic Problems |volume=3 |last=Bleich |first=J. David |authorlink=J.

Other forms of [[ritual slaughter]], such as [[Ritual slaughter#Islamic .E1.B8.8Eab.C4.AB.E1.B8.A5ah|Islamic ritual slaughter]], have also come under controversy. Writing for [[PETA]], Logan Scherer said that animals sacrificed according to Islamic law can not be stunned before they are killed.&lt;ref name="PETA Islam animals"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.peta.org/b/thepetafiles/archive/2009/12/08/the-cruelty-behind-muslim-ritual-slaughter.aspx | title=The Cruelty Behind Muslim Ritual Slaughter | publisher=PETA | date=December 8, 2009 | accessdate=July 25, 2012 | author=Scherer, Logan}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Muslims are only allowed to eat meat that has been killed according to Sharia law and they say that Islamic law on ritual slaughter is designed to reduce the pain and distress that the animal suffers.&lt;ref name="BBC Islam Animals"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/islamethics/animals_1.shtml | title=Treatment of animals: Islam and animals | publisher=BBC | date=August 13, 2009 | accessdate=July 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Farm Animal Welfare Committee]], halal and kosher practices should be banned because when animals are not stunned before death, they suffer needless [[pain]] for up to 2 minutes despite some [[Muslims (ethnicity)|Muslims]] and [[Jews]] arguing that loss of blood from slash to the throat renders the animals unconscious relatively quickly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Halal and Kosher slaughter 'must end'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/2977086.stm|publisher=BBC News | date=2003-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Response to criticism of morality===

Not all religions are hostile to homosexuality. Both [[Reform Judaism]] and the [[Unitarian Universalist Association]] have advocated for equal rights for gay and lesbian people since the 1970s.{{efn|In 1970, the UUA passed a resolution calling for an end to anti-gay discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.uua.org/lgbtq/witness/policy/facts&lt;/ref&gt; The Union for Reform Judaism passed a similar resolution in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hrc.org/resources/stances-of-faiths-on-lgbt-issues-reform-judaism&lt;/ref&gt;}} [[Homosexuality and Hinduism|Hinduism]] does not view homosexuality as an issue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rediff.com/news/1998/dec/04fire.htm] quote - "''Hinduism, unlike Christianity and Islam, does not view homosexuality as a religious sin.''"&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Dominion theology|Christian reconstructionism}}
The term "[[dominionism]]" is often used to describe a political movement among [[fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalist Christians]]. Critics view dominionism as an attempt to improperly impose Christianity as the national faith of the United States. It emerged in the late 1980s inspired by the book, film and lecture series "Whatever Happened to the Human Race?" by [[Francis Schaeffer|Francis A. Schaeffer]] and [[C. Everett Koop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last =Diamond | first =Sara | authorlink =Sara Diamond |  title =Spiritual Warfare: The Politics of the Christian Right | publisher =[[South End Press]] | year =1989 | location =Boston | doi =  | id =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Schaeffer's views influenced conservatives like [[Jerry Falwell]], [[Pat Robertson]], [[Tim LaHaye]], [[Rutherford Institute|John W.

'''Dini ya Misambwa''' (Religion of the Ancestor) is an [[African traditional religion]] that has been labeled  an anti-colonial religion&lt;ref name="Institute of Current World Affairs"&gt;[http://www.icwa.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DER-20.pdf Newsletter], [[Institute of Current World Affairs]], August 1, 1954&lt;/ref&gt;. It is practiced primarily among the [[Luhya speaking people]] of Western [[Kenya]].&lt;ref name="Kustenbauder"&gt;[http://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/5326138/Kustenbauder%20-%20Prophetic%20Movements%20Eastern%20Africa%20-%20New%20Encyclopedia%20of%20Africa%20-%20DASH.pdf?sequence=1 Prophetic Movements: Eastern Africa], ''New Encyclopedia of Africa'', 4th edition Pages 261-270, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of religions to fight injustice is not new. Dini ya Misambwa, an [[African traditional religion]], stood against colonialism during the British colonial rule of Kenya. Among other things, it criticized the undermining, by the British colonial government, of elder authority and of the cultural values that had held Kenyan peoples together for ages. 


The undermining of cultural values was potentially more damaging than even the plunder of resources that's felt within the African continent today. We know that autonomous, purposive actors with the necessary capabilities and instruments often attempt to influence others to operate in an equilibrium in which degree of reciprocity and extent of influence establish the relative distribution of behavioral power within the international system (Ward &amp; House, 1998).&lt;ref&gt;Ward, M. D., &amp; House, L. L. (1998). A Theory of the Behavioral Power of Nations : THE THEORY OF BEHAVIORAL ... The Journal of Conflict Resolution (1986-1998), 32(1), 3. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/236097972&lt;/ref&gt;

The old authority of the tribal elders had been undermined with the advent of colonial rule. It was the elders in turn who had lent power to the old tribal religion or [[African traditional religion]] and hence it too was also undermined. Left in a spiritual vacuum, many Bukusu and [[luhya people|luhya]], insecure in the rapidly-changing world, gravitated naturally into Christianity (Reed, 1954).&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Reed, D. E. (1954). Dini ya Msambwa I: The Bukusu and The Suk. Institute of Current World Affairs, 1–18. Retrieved from http://www.icwa.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/DER-20.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Masinde being an elder did not roll-over and run, he should not have been expected to.

Looking at most African countries, one realizes major damage caused by the undermining of traditional elder leadership and the traditional [[African traditional religions]] on the social imaginaries which make Africans who they are, continue to be an issue in every society. It is even more rampant when one thinks of the role religion plays in determining who they are, what they believe and how they should act and react. It’s clear, imported religions have their origin and this origin cannot be disassociated from the belief inherent in the religions. There is a need to free the mind of its conditionings that give priority to religion and may, therefore, serve to exclude other sources of identity derived from collective histories and collective experiences. The illusion into which religion plunges Africans is often the reason for the problems of identity which most African societies struggle with today. An awareness of this illusion and a new understanding of identity as derived from a shared African experience will go a long way in resolving the problem of identity in Africa (Muyingi, 2015). That is why it is important that anyone editing or deleting this post should provide authoritative citation and proof that they are not just trying to rewrite history.&lt;ref&gt;Muyingi, M. A. (2015). Religion : A New Struggle for African Identity. Asia Journal of Theology, 29(1), 88–99. https://doi.org/http://dx.doi.org/10.17159/2413-3086/2016/120&lt;/ref&gt;

We know from Max Weber that, the state is a relation of men dominating men, a relationship supported using legitimate (i.e. considered to be legitimate) violence (Schriften, Uni, Gerth, &amp; Mills, 1946).&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Schriften, G. P., Uni, M., Gerth, F. H. H., &amp; Mills, W. (1946). "Politics as a Vocation" Max Weber. Munich: Oxford University Press. Retrieved from http://fs2.american.edu/dfagel/www/Class Readings/Weber/PoliticsAsAVocation.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Dini Ya Misambwa was therefore not anti-white but an anti-colonial rule, Reed (1954) reports that colonial rule undermined traditional rulers and the values, assumptions, beliefs, and expectations they stood for leaving a vacuum that Dini ya Msambwa tried to fill.

Reed (1954) also reports that the first European to reach Bukusu was Joseph Thomson, who arrived in 1883, he found the Bukusu living in fortified villages surrounded by moats. These were a protection against raids from the Uasin Gishu Masai and the Teso tribe of Uganda. British administration was established in North Nyanza in 1894. The following year the Bukusu killed 25 soldiers of the Sudanese garrison and a punitive expedition was undertaken against them. Their fortified villages were stormed by Sudanese troops and Africans from other tribes, and the fighting ended when the Bukusu acknowledged British rule and promised to abandon their villages. Today they live in scattered homesteads (Reed, 1954).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Although he reports ethnocentrically, we can glean from his writing that the country he found was not desperate, and there was no racism, but terms like “progress” implying adoption of “European way” are telling as for why they might have been resentment!&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

It was founded by [[Elijah Masinde]] in 1936. After Kenyan independence 1968 Dini ya Msambwa was made illegal and Masinde was arrested for fomenting Christian religion hatred.
“The essence of neo-colonialism is that the State which is subject to it is, in theory, independent and has all the outward trappings of international sovereignty. In reality, its economic system and thus its political policy is directed from outside” - Osagyefo Dr. Kwame Nkrumah (1909–1972). That was the objection that leads to Dini ya Misambwa being banned in post-colonial Kenya not hatred to white people (Bonsu &amp; Ed, 2016). Secondly, a point must be made that
Western scholars were the first to write about ATR. Thus they dominated the study of [[African traditional religions]]. Their writings were borne out of prejudice or probably out of the impatience of the researchers to look at the universal meaning of the terms they used to describe the religious life of African people cited from Asukwo, Adaka &amp; Dimgba, (2013) by (Bonsu &amp; Ed, 2016). [[African traditional religions ]](ATR) practices have suffered from various racial and is leading terminologies. These terminologies which include, but not limited to paganism, heathenism, fetishism, savage, ancestral worship, juju and animism have been used widely by Euro-American
missionaries and researchers in an attempt to belittle African people and religion (Bonsu &amp; Ed, 2016).&lt;ref&gt;Bonsu, N. O., &amp; Ed, B. (2016). [[African traditional religions]] : An Examination of Terminologies Used for Describing the Indigenous Faith of African People, Using an Afrocentric Paradigm by. Africology: The Journal of Pan African Studies, 9(9), 108–122. Retrieved from http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=6d5c28a3-4535-486f-be91-6ea5871e2b33%40sessionmgr4007&amp;vid=4&amp;hid=4212&lt;/ref&gt;
Dini Ya Misambwa is, therefore, an [[African traditional religions|African traditional religion]]; its followers worshiping in Nyasaye/Were, God is an English word, it has other words in other languages Nyasaye or Were is God in Luhya. Through Ancestral Spirits (Misambwa) in shrines. Just like Abraham, Joseph, Muhamed are ancestors of Christians or Muslims, the people who come before you play a big role in value formation; so it happens in [[African traditional religions]] (Bonsu &amp; Ed, 2016)

'''''Disputationes''''' (full title: '''''[[Disputation|Disputationes]] de Controversiis Christianae Fidei adversus hujus temporis Haereticos'''''{{Pronunciation needed}}&lt;!-- as IPA --&gt;, also referred to as '''''De Controversiis''''') is a work on dogmatics by [[Robert Bellarmine]]. It has been described as "the definitive defence of papal power".&lt;ref name="THCB"&gt;Patricia Springborg. "Thomas Hobbes and Cardinal Bellarmine". ''History of Political Thought''. XVI:4 (Winter 1995), pp. 503-531: 506.&lt;/ref&gt; After its publication, Bellarmine was regarded as Rome's foremost apologist on doctrine and [[Papacy|papal power]].&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Springborg. "Thomas Hobbes and Cardinal Bellarmine". ''History of Political Thought''. XVI:4 (Winter 1995), pp. 503-531: 515-516.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was written while Bellarmine was lecturing at the [[Roman College]], and was first published at [[Ingolstadt]] in three volumes (1581, 1582, 1593)&lt;ref name="THCB"/&gt; or four.&lt;ref name="RB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.masterliness.com/a/Robert.Bellarmine.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080726143537/http://www.masterliness.com/a/Robert.Bellarmine.htm |archivedate=2008-07-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This work was the earliest attempt to systematize the various controversies of the time, and made an immense impression throughout Europe, the strength of its arguments against [[Protestantism]] so acutely felt in Germany and England that special chairs were founded in order to provide replies to it.&lt;ref name = "CC"&gt;http://www.catholicity.com/encyclopedia/r/robert_francis_romulus_bellarmine,saint.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Hobbes]],&lt;ref name="THCB"/&gt; [[Theodore Beza]]&lt;ref name="THCB516"&gt;Patricia Springborg. "Thomas Hobbes and Cardinal Bellarmine". ''History of Political Thought''. XVI:4 (Winter 1995), pp. 503-531: 516.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Rainolds]]&lt;ref name="THCB516"/&gt; were among those who wrote counter-arguments against the work.

The first volume treats of the [[Word of God (Bible)|Word of God]], of [[Christ]], and of the [[pope]]; the second of the authority of [[ecumenical council]]s, and of the [[Church (Christian)|Church]], whether militant, suffering, or triumphant; the third of the [[sacrament]]s; and the fourth of [[Divine grace]], [[free will]], [[justification (theology)|justification]], and [[good works]].&lt;ref name="RB"/&gt;

As much as Protestants disliked Bellarmine's theories, he was in fact moderate in his defence of papal power. In 1590, [[Pope Sixtus V]] had, or very nearly had,&lt;ref name="CC"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://dailycatholic.org/issue/2003Sep/sep14doc.htm&lt;/ref&gt; the first volume placed on the [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]] for denying temporal hegemony to the papacy. Bellarmine's reasoning was that though the pope is the vicar of Christ, since Christ did not ''exercise'' his [[Temporal power (Papal)|temporal power]], nor may the pope.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Springborg. "Thomas Hobbes and Cardinal Bellarmine". ''History of Political Thought''. XVI:4 (Winter 1995), pp. 503-531: 516-517.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important part of the work is contained in the five books regarding the pope. In these, after a speculative introduction on forms of [[government]] in general, holding [[monarchy]] to be relatively the best, Bellarmine says that a monarchical government and the related temporal power are necessary for the Church, to preserve unity and order in it.

Such power Bellarmine considers to have been established by the commission of Christ to [[Saint Peter]]. He then proceeds to demonstrate that this power has been transmitted to the successors of Peter, admitting that a heretical pope may be freely judged and deposed by the Church since by the very fact of his [[Christian heresy|heresy]] he would cease to be pope, or even a member of the Church.

The third section discusses the [[Antichrist]]. Bellarmine gives in full the theory set forth by the [[Church Fathers]], of a personal Antichrist to come just before the end of the world and to be accepted by the [[Jew]]s and enthroned in the [[Temple in Jerusalem]]—thus endeavoring to dispose of the Protestant exposition which saw in the pope the Antichrist.

The fourth section sets forth the pope as the supreme judge in matters of faith and morals, though making the concessions that the pope may err in questions of fact which may be known by ordinary human knowledge, and also when he speaks as a mere unofficial theologian. Bellarmine took in particular the example of [[Pope Honorius I]], who had been anathemized by the [[Third Council of Constantinople]] as holding to [[monothelitism]]. He claimed that although monothelitism had been rightly condemned, Honorius was however orthodox as he had not really held these views, and that papal authority did not extend itself to the factual interpretation of what was to be found in Honorius or not.&lt;ref&gt;[[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]], [http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/p/pascal/blaise/p27pr/part17.html 17th Letter] of the [[Provincial Letters]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Translation into English==

{{refimprove|date=February 2012}}

'''Earthseed''' is a [[religion]] based on the idea that "[[God]] is Change."  It is the creation of [[Octavia E. Butler]], as revealed by her character Lauren [[Oya]] Olamina in the books: ''[[Parable of the Sower (novel)|Parable of the Sower]]'' and ''[[Parable of the Talents (novel)|Parable of the Talents]]''.  (A third book of the trilogy, ''Parable of the Trickster'', was not completed before Butler's death.)

== Background ==

''Parable of the Sower'' is a futuristic, dystopian, science-fiction novel.  In its reality, the United States has devolved into states and/or city-states warring for the few remaining resources.  Life is cheap, and the economy is becoming reborn as [[company towns]].

The main character in ''Parable of the Sower'', Lauren Olamina, is the daughter of a Baptist minister who serves their walled-in neighborhood.  Because of her mother's addiction to a prescription  drug, Olamina suffers from ''hyperempathy'', which causes her to share pain or perceived pain with any living creature she sees.  When her community is attacked, burned, and looted, seventeen-year-old Olamina barely escapes with her life.  She travels, at great danger, into northern California in search of a haven where she and others can build the first Earthseed community.

The beliefs of Earthseed are recorded in the fictional book ''Earthseed: The Books of the Living''.  Olamina "writes" in short, poetic passages.  Portions of this text are presented at the beginning of each section, some chapters, and occasionally throughout the text.  The philosophy of Earthseed also underlies the motivations of some of the characters in these novels.

== Central tenets ==

The word "Earthseed" comes from the idea that the seeds of all life on Earth can be transplanted, and through adaptation will grow, in many different types of situations or places.  "The Books of the Living" is chosen in direct contrast to many other religions' use of the phrase "The Books of the Dead".  Earthseed is a religion of the present and the future, of the living, not of the dead or the past.

Although Olamina is raised as a Baptist, she does not feel comfortable with "her father's God."  Instead, she develops ideas that seem to better fit the reality she knows.

Because "God is Change", humans are able to direct God's malleability. Believers are enjoined to "shape God".  By shaping themselves, they can save themselves.  Believers are to accept the central tenet that "God is Change" primarily so that they will recognize their own power to affect and direct Change/God.  Only by conscious effort can they avoid being God's victims.

Earthseed also promotes the belief that "The Destiny of Earthseed / '''Is''' to take root among the stars" (''The Parable of the Sower'', Octavia E. Butler).  The Destiny is necessary because, eventually, we will outgrow [[Earth]] (i.e., use up its natural resources).

The central verse of Earthseed is given in the following:

{{quote|
Consider:  Whether you're a human being, an insect, a microbe, or a stone, this verse is true.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;All that you touch
You Change.

All that you Change
Changes you.

The only lasting truth
Is Change.

God
Is Change.&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;|Octavia E. Butler|''Parable of the Sower''
}}

The central paradox of Earthseed is:

{{quote|
&lt;poem&gt;Why is the universe?
To shape God.

Why is God?
To shape the universe.&lt;/poem&gt;
|Octavia Butler|''Parable of the Sower''
}}

== Influence ==

While the religion began as fiction, it has inspired several real-world movements.

The [[Terasem Movement]] seeks the development of humanity through technology, and to bridge the gap between science and religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://time.com/66536/terasem-trascendence-religion-technology/ |title=The Rapture of the Nerds|first=Jessica |last=Roy |work=Time |date=April 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Terasem'' comes from the Latin ''[[wikt:Terra|Terra]]'' ('earth') and ''[[wikt:semen#Latin|sēmen]]'' ('seed').  Like the fictional Earthseed, Terasem Movement attempts to "shape God", but through technology.

There is also a [[Modern Paganism|humanistic pagan]] website called Earthseed, and a social movement named SolSeed.

'''Equanimity''' ([[Latin]]: ''æquanimitas'', having an even mind; ''aequus'' even; ''animus'' mind/soul) is a state of psychological stability and composure which is undisturbed by experience of or exposure to emotions, pain, or other phenomena that may cause others to lose the balance of their mind.  The [[virtue]] and value of equanimity is extolled and advocated by a number of  major religions and ancient philosophies.
{{wikt}}

==Etymology==
From Fr. ''équanimité'', from L. ''aequanimitatem'' (nom. ''aequanimitas'') "evenness of mind, calmness," from ''aequus'' "even, level" (see equal) + ''animus'' "mind, spirit" (see animus). Meaning "evenness of temper" in English is from 1610s.

==Hinduism==
In Hinduism the term for equanimity is समत्व ''[[samatva]]m'' (also rendered ''samatva'' or ''samata'').&lt;ref&gt; ''The Encyclopedia of Yoga and Tantra'', [[Georg Feuerstein]], 2011&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Chapter Two, Verse 48 of the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'' one reads: ''yoga-sthaḥ kuru karmāṇi saṅgaṁ tyaktvā dhanañ-jaya siddhy-asiddhyoḥ samo bhūtvā samatvaṁ yoga ucyate''. [[Srila Prabhupada]] translates this as: Perform your duty equipoised, O Arjuna, abandoning all attachment to success or failure. Such equanimity is called yoga.&lt;ref&gt;''Bhagavad Gita As it Is'', A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda&lt;/ref&gt;
                
In his book ''Samatvam - The Yoga of Equanimity'', [[Swami Sivananda]] states: 

"An aspirant who treads the path to ''samatvam'' must make every effort to acquire the following essential qualities: ''[[Viveka]]'', discrimination; ''[[vairagya]]'', dispassion; ''shadsampat'', the six virtues (''shama'', mental calmness and control; ''dama'', restraint of the senses; ''[[uparati]]'', sense withdrawal or ''[[pratyahara]]''; ''[[titiksha]]'', endurance; ''shraddha'', faith and ''[[samadhana]]'', mental balance); and an intense desire for liberation, ''mumukshutva''. In order to possess the virtue of ''Samatvam'', he will also need to dedicate himself to steadying the mind every moment of his yoga career..."&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 3, "The Pathway to Samatvam", ''Samatvam: The Yoga of Equanimity'', Swami Sivananda Saraswati.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yoga===
Another Sanskrit term for equanimity is ''[[Upeksha (Indian thought)|upekṣhā]]''. This is the term used by [[Patanjali]] in his ''[[Yoga Sutras]]'' (1.33),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Commentary on the Yoga Sutras|author=Swami Jnaneshvara Bharati|publisher=Swami Jnaneshvara Bharati|url=http://www.swamij.com/yoga-sutras-13339.htm#1.33|accessdate=2009-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here ''upekṣhā'' is considered to be one of the [[Brahmavihara|four sublime attitudes]], along with [[Mettā|loving-kindness]] (''maitri''), [[Karuṇā|compassion]] (''karuṇā''), and [[mudita|joy]] (''mudita''). It is related to the idea of [[Vairagya]] or "dispassion". The Upeksha Yoga school foregrounds equanimity as the most important tenet of a [[yoga]] practice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upekshayoga.com/yoga/Principles.html Upeksha yoga]&lt;/ref&gt;

In many [[Yoga]] traditions, the virtue of equanimity can be one of the results attained through regular [[meditation]], combined with regular practice of [[pranayama]], asanas and mental disciplines, which clear the mind and bring one inexorably toward a state of health and balance.

==Stoicism==
Equanimity is a central concept in [[Stoic ethics]] and psychology. The Greek stoics use the word ''[[apatheia]]'' or ''[[ataraxia]]'' whereas the Roman stoics used the Latin word ''aequanimitas''. The Roman Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]]'s ''[[Meditations]]'' detail a philosophy of service and duty, describing how to find and preserve equanimity in the midst of conflict by following nature as a source of guidance and inspiration. His adoptive father [[Antoninus Pius]]'s last word was uttered when the tribune of the night-watch came to ask him for the night's password — Pius decided upon "aequanimitas" (equanimity). {{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

==Pyrrhonism==
In [[Pyrrhonism]] the term used for equanimity is ''[[ataraxia]]'', which means to be unperturbed. Ataraxia the goal of Pyrrhonist practice. 

==Buddhism==
In [[Buddhism]], [[upekkha|equanimity]] (''[[upekkhā]]'', ''upekṣhā'') is one of the [[Brahmavihara|four sublime attitudes]] and is considered:

{{quote|Neither a thought nor an emotion, it is rather the steady conscious realization of reality's transience. It is the ground for [[wisdom]] and [[free will|freedom]] and the protector of [[compassion]] and [[love]]. While some may think of equanimity as dry neutrality or cool aloofness, mature equanimity produces a radiance and warmth of being. The [[Buddha]] described a mind filled with equanimity as "abundant, exalted, immeasurable, without hostility and without ill-will."|&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Equanimity|author=[[Gil Fronsdal]]|publisher=Insight Meditation Center|url=http://www.insightmeditationcenter.org/articles/equanimity.html|date=2004-05-29|accessdate=2009-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}Equanimity can also be cultivated through meditation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brahmana|first=Metteyya|date=2016-05-14|title=NEW EQUANIMITY MEDITATION AND TOOLS FROM PSYCHOLOGY AND NEUROSCIENCE TO TEST ITS EFFECTIVENESS|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303111890_NEW_EQUANIMITY_MEDITATION_AND_TOOLS_FROM_PSYCHOLOGY_AND_NEUROSCIENCE_TO_TEST_ITS_EFFECTIVENESS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judaism==
Many Jewish thinkers highlight the importance of equanimity (Menuhat ha-Nefesh or Yishuv ha-Da'at) as a necessary foundation for moral and spiritual development.  The virtue of equanimity receives particular attention in the writings of rabbis such as [[Baal Shem Tov|Rabbi Yisroel Bal Shem Tov]] and [[Simcha Zissel Ziv|Rabbi Simcha Zissel Ziv]].

==Christianity==
[[Samuel Johnson]] defined equanimity as "evenness of mind, neither elated nor depressed." In [[Christian philosophy]], equanimity is considered essential for carrying out the [[theological virtues]] of [[gentleness]], [[contentment]], [[Temperance (virtue)|temperance]], and [[Charity (virtue)|charity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Twenty Essays on the Practical Improvement of God's Providential Dispensations as Means of Moral Discipline to the Christian|publisher=RB Seeley and W Burnside|page=51|year=1838|location=London|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lFwEAAAAQAAJ&amp;vq=Johnson&amp;dq=Equanimity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islam==
The word “[[Islam]]” is derived from the [[Arabic]] word ''aslama'', which denotes the peace that comes from total surrender and acceptance&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Islam|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A Muslim may experientially behold that everything happening is meant to be, and stems from the ultimate wisdom of God; hence, being a [[Muslim]] can therefore be understood to mean that one is in a state of equanimity.

==Baha'i Faith==
The voluminous Writings of the Baha'i Faith are filled with thousands of references to divine attributes, of which equanimity is one. Similar in intent and more frequently used than "equanimity" in the Baha'i Writings are "detachment" and "selflessness" which dispose human beings to free themselves from inordinate reactions to the changes and chances of the world. Humanity is called upon to show complete and sublime detachment from aught else but God, from all that is in the heavens and all that is on earth, from the material world and from the promptings of their own interests and passions. Related concepts include faith, the concept of growing through suffering and being tested, fortitude under trials, dignity, patience, prudence, moderation, freedom from material things, radiant acquiescence, wisdom and evanescence.{{Original research inline|date=June 2018}} Baha'u'llah, the Central Personage of the Baha'i Faith, wrote: "Until a being setteth his foot in the plane of sacrifice, he is bereft of every favour and grace; and this plane of sacrifice is the realm of dying to the self, that the radiance of the living God may then shine forth. The martyr’s field is the place of detachment from self, that the anthems of eternity may be upraised. Do all ye can to become wholly weary of self, and bind yourselves to that Countenance of Splendours; and once ye have reached such heights of servitude, ye will find, gathered within your shadow, all created things. This is boundless grace; this is the highest sovereignty; this is the life that dieth not. All else save this is at the last but manifest perdition and great loss."{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

The highly revered Son of Baha'u'llah, 'Abdu'l-Baha, was an exile and prisoner along with His Father, for more than forty years facing a torrent of various hardships.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} It is written about him: "So imperturbable was ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s equanimity that, while rumors were being bruited about that He might be cast into the sea, or exiled to Fizán in Tripolitania, or hanged on the gallows, He, to the amazement of His friends and the amusement of His enemies, was to be seen planting trees and vines in the garden of His house, whose fruits when the storm had blown over, He would bid His faithful gardener, Ismá’íl Áqá, pluck and present to those same friends and enemies on the occasion of their visits to Him."{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} When in London He was asked about His time in prison and said: "Freedom is not a matter of place. It is a condition. I was thankful for the prison, and the lack of liberty was very pleasing to me, for those days were passed in the path of service, under the utmost difficulties and trials, bearing fruits and results...Unless one accepts dire vicissitudes, he will not attain...When one is released from the prison of self, that is indeed release, for that is the greater prison...The afflictions which come to humanity sometimes tend to centre the consciousness upon the limitations, and this is a veritable prison. Release comes by making of the will a Door through which the confirmations of the Spirit come."{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} Asked about this He said: The confirmations of the Spirit are all those powers and gifts which some are born with (and which men sometimes call genius), but for which others have to strive with infinite pains. They come to that man or woman who accepts his life with radiant acquiescence. Radiant acquiescence—that was the quality with which we all suddenly seemed inspired as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá bade us good-bye."{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

The following quote by 'Abdu'l-Baha offers a perspective aimed at cultivating equanimity.{{Original research inline|date=June 2018}} He wrote: "Grieve thou not over the troubles and hardships of this nether world, nor be thou glad in times of ease and comfort, for both shall pass away. This present life is even as a swelling wave, or a mirage, or drifting shadows. Could ever a distorted image on the desert serve as refreshing waters? No, by the Lord of Lords! Never can reality and the mere semblance of reality be one, and wide is the difference between fancy and fact, between truth and the phantom thereof. Know thou that the Kingdom is the real world, and this nether place is only its shadow stretching out. A shadow hath no life of its own; its existence is only a fantasy, and nothing more; it is but images reflected in water, and seeming as pictures to the eye. Rely upon God. Trust in Him. Praise Him, and call Him continually to mind. He verily turneth trouble into ease, and sorrow into solace, and toil into utter peace. He verily hath dominion over all things. If thou wouldst hearken to my words, release thyself from the fetters of whatsoever cometh to pass. Nay rather, under all conditions thank thou thy loving Lord, and yield up thine affairs unto His Will that worketh as He pleaseth. This verily is better for thee than all else, in either world." {{Citation needed|reason=Source must be directly cited and linked to as footnote|date=June 2018}}

[[Ethics]] involves systematizing, defending, and recommending concepts of right and wrong behavior.&lt;ref name="iep.utm.edu"&gt;''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy'': [http://www.iep.utm.edu/ethics/ "Ethics"]&lt;/ref&gt; A central aspect of ethics is "the good life", the life worth living or life that is simply satisfying, which is held by many philosophers to be more important than traditional [[Morality|moral]] conduct.&lt;ref&gt;Singer, P. (1993) ''Practical Ethics'', 2nd edition (p.10), Cambridge: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Most [[religion]]s have an [[ethics|ethical]] component, often derived from purported supernatural [[revelation]] or guidance. Some assert that religion is necessary to live ethically. Blackburn states that there are those who "would say that we can only flourish under the umbrella of a strong social order, cemented by common adherence to a particular religious tradition".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Ethics: A Very Short Introduction|last= Simon|first= Blackburn|year= 2001|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= Oxford|isbn= 978-0-19-280442-6|page= 90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhist ethics==
{{Main|Buddhist ethics}}
Ethics in [[Buddhism]] are traditionally based on the [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightened]] perspective of the [[Buddha]], or other enlightened beings who followed him. Moral instructions are included in [[Buddhist scriptures]] or handed down through tradition. Most scholars of Buddhist ethics thus rely on the examination of Buddhist scriptures, and the use of anthropological evidence from traditional Buddhist societies, to justify claims about the nature of Buddhist ethics.&lt;ref&gt;Damien Keown ''The Nature of Buddhist Ethics'' Macmillan 1992; Peter Harvey ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics'' Cambridge University Press 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

According to traditional Buddhism, the foundation of Buddhist ethics for laypeople is the [[The Five Precepts|Pancasila]]: no killing, stealing, lying, sexual misconduct, or intoxicants. In becoming a Buddhist, or affirming one's commitment to Buddhism, a layperson is encouraged to vow to abstain from these negative actions. Buddhist monks and nuns take hundreds more such vows (see [[vinaya]]).{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

The sole reliance on traditional formulae or practices, however, can be questioned by Western Buddhists whose main concern is the practical solution of complex moral problems in the modern world. To find a justifiable approach to such problems it may be necessary not just to appeal to the precepts or the ''vinaya'', but to use more basic Buddhist teachings (such as the [[Middle Way]]) to aid interpretation of the precepts and find more basic justifications for their usefulness relevant to all human experience. This approach avoids basing Buddhist ethics solely on faith in the Buddha's enlightenment or Buddhist tradition, and may allow more universal non-Buddhist access to the insights offered by Buddhist ethics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moralobjectivity.net/thesis_index.html Robert Ellis ''A Buddhist theory of moral objectivity'' (Ph.D. thesis)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723211924/http://www.moralobjectivity.net/thesis_index.html |date=2011-07-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Buddha provided some basic guidelines for acceptable behavior that are part of the [[Noble Eightfold Path]]. The initial percept is non-injury or non-violence to all living creatures from the lowest insect to humans. This precept defines a non-violent attitude toward every living thing. The Buddhist practice of this does not extend to the extremes exhibited by Jainism, but from both the Buddhist and Jain perspectives, non-violence suggests an intimate involvement with, and relationship to, all living things.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Olson, ''The Different Paths of Buddhism'' p.73&lt;/ref&gt;

Theravada monk [[Bhikkhu Bodhi]] has observed:
:"Buddhist ethics, as formulated in the five precepts, is sometimes charged with being entirely negative. ... [I]t has to be pointed out that the five precepts, or even the longer codes of precepts promulgated by the Buddha, do not exhaust the full range of Buddhist ethics. The precepts are only the most rudimentary code of moral training, but the Buddha also proposes other ethical codes inculcating definite positive virtues. The Mangala Sutta, for example, commends reverence, humility, contentment, gratitude, patience, generosity, etc. Other discourses prescribe numerous family, social, and political duties establishing the well being of society. And behind all these duties lie the four attitudes called the "immeasurables" — loving-kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy, and equanimity."&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi (1994). For other examples of Buddhist discourses that promote ethical behaviors among laity see, for instance, the [[Sigalovada Sutta]] (referred to as "the [[Vinaya]] of the householder" by [[Buddhaghosa]]) and the [[Dhammika Sutta]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christian ethics==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2012}}
{{Main|Christian ethics}}
{{See also|Sermon on the Mount|The New Commandment|Ministry of Jesus}}

Christian ethics in general has tended to stress the need for love, [[divine grace|grace]], [[mercy]], and [[forgiveness]] because of [[Christian views on sin|sin]]. With divine assistance, the Christian is called to become increasingly [[Virtuous#Christian tradition|virtuous]] in both thought and deed, see also the [[Evangelical counsels]]. Conversely, the Christian is also called to abstain from [[vice]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Christian ethical principles are based on the teachings within the [[Bible]]. They begin with the notion of inherent sinfulness, which requires essential [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]]. Sin is estrangement from God which is the result of not doing God's will.  God's will can be summed up by the precept: "Love God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength, and your neighbor as yourself", commonly called the [[Great Commandment]]. Christian ethics are founded upon the concept of [[Grace (Christianity)|grace]] which transforms a person's life and enable's one to choose and act righteously.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} As sin is both individual and social, so is grace applied to both the individual and society.  Christian ethics has a [[teleological]] aspect—all ethical behavior is oriented towards a vision of the [[Kingdom of God]]—a righteous society where all live in peace and harmony with God and nature, as envisioned in the [[Book of Isaiah]]. Specific ethical behaviors originate in the [[Old Testament]]’s [[Ten Commandments]], and are enriched by teachings in the Psalms and morals contained in historical accounts, see also [[Biblical law in Christianity]].

Christian ethics is not substantially different from [[Jewish ethics]], except in the exhortation to [[Expounding of the Law#Love for enemies|love one's enemy]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}  Perhaps the greatest contribution of Christian ethics is this command to love one's enemies.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}  It has been argued (see [[Ched Myers]]'s ''Binding the Strong Man'', and [[John Howard Yoder]]'s ''The Politics of Jesus'') that Jesus was waging a [[Nonviolent revolution|non-violent campaign]] against the [[Jewish–Roman wars|Roman oppressors]] and many of his sayings relate to this campaign--[[turn the other cheek]], go the second mile, etc. Understanding these commands as part of a larger campaign makes it impossible to interpret Christian ethics as an individual ethic.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}  It is both an individual and a social ethic concerned with life here on earth.

Other tenets include maintaining personal integrity and the absence of hypocrisy, as well as honesty and loyalty, mercy and forgiveness, rejection of materialism and the desire for wealth and power, and teaching others in your life through personal joy, happiness and Godly devotion.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

There are several different schema of vice and virtue. [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]] adopted the four cardinal virtues of Aristotle (justice, courage, temperance and prudence), and added to them the Christian virtues of faith, hope and charity (from St.Paul, {{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|13}}). Other schema include the [[Seven Deadly Sins]] and the [[Seven virtues]]. For more see [[Christian philosophy]] and [[Biblical law in Christianity]].

==Confucian ethics==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2012}}
[[Confucianism]] and [[Neo-Confucianism]] emphasize the maintenance and propriety of relationships as the most important consideration in ethics. To be ethical is to do what one's relationships require. Notably, though, what you owe to another person is inversely proportional to their distance from you. In other words, you owe your parents everything, but you are not in any way obligated towards strangers. This can be seen as a recognition of the fact that it is impossible to love the entire world equally and simultaneously. This is called relational ethics, or [[situational ethics]]. The Confucian system differs very strongly from [[Kantian ethics]] in that there are rarely laws or principles which can be said to be true absolutely or universally.

This is not to say that there has never been any consideration given to universalist ethics. In fact, in [[Zhou Dynasty]] China, the Confucians' main opponents, the followers of [[Mozi]] argued for universal love ({{Zh|s=兼爱|p=jiān ài}}). The Confucian view eventually held sway, however, and continues to dominate many aspects of Chinese thought. Many have argued, for example, that [[Mao Zedong]] was more Confucian than Communist.
Confucianism, especially of the type argued for by [[Mencius]] ({{Zh|s=孟子|p=mèng zĭ}}), argued that the ideal ruler is the one who (as Confucius put it) "acts like the North Star, staying in place while the other stars orbit around it". In other words, the ideal ruler does not go out and force the people to become good, but instead leads by example. The ideal ruler fosters harmony rather than laws.

Confucius stresses [[honesty]] above all. His concepts of [[lĭ]] ({{Zh|s=理}}), [[Yi (Confucianism)|yì]] ({{Zh|s=義}}), and [[Ren (Confucianism)|rén]] ({{Zh|s=仁}}) can be seen as deeper expressions of honesty ({{Zh|s=誠|p=[[chéng]]|l=[[sincerity]]}}) and [[fidelity]] ({{Zh|s=孝|p=[[xiào]]}}) to the ones to whom one owes one's existence (parents) and survival (one's neighbours, colleagues, inferiors in rank). He codified traditional practice and actually changed the meaning of the prior concepts that those words had meant. His model of the Confucian family and Confucian ruler dominated Chinese life into the early 20th century. This had ossified by then into an Imperial hierarchy of rigid [[property rights]], hard to distinguish from any other [[dictatorship]]. Traditional ethics had been perverted by [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|legalism]].

===Buddhist influence===
Buddhism, and specifically [[Mahayana Buddhism]], brought a cohesive metaphysic to Chinese thought and a strong emphasis on universalism. Neo-Confucianism was largely a reaction to Buddhism's dominance in the [[Tang dynasty]], and an attempt at developing a native Confucian metaphysical/analytical system.

==Daoist ethics==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2012}}
[[Laozi]] (Lao Tzu) and other [[Daoist|Taoist]] (Daoist) authors argued for an even greater passivity on the part of rulers than did the Confucians. For Laozi, (Lao Tzu) the ideal ruler is one who does virtually nothing that can be directly identified as ruling. Clearly, both Daoism and Confucianism presume that human nature is basically good. The main branch of Confucianism, however, argues that human nature must be nurtured through ritual (''[[Li (Confucian)|li]]'' 禮), culture (''[[Chinese culture|wen]]'' 文) and other things, while the Daoists (Taoists) argued that the trappings of society were to be gotten rid of.

Taoist ethics ask for a greater ''sense of being'' and less identification with ''the act of''  ''doing''.  Taoist ''passivity'' nurtures, cultivates and prepares an atmosphere that allows ''the majestic'' and ''the real'' to shine, which influences society for the better.    - "If you want to awaken all of humanity, then awaken all of yourself; if you want to eliminate the suffering in the world, then eliminate all that is dark and negative in yourself.  Truly, the greatest gift you have to give is that of your own self-transformation."   - Lao Tzu

Ethics are explained in Hindu philosophy as something that cannot be imposed, but something that is realized and voluntarily lived up to by each individual. For example, [[Apastamba]] explained it thus: "virtue and vice do not go about saying - here we are!; neither the Gods, Gandharvas, nor ancestors can convince us - this is right, this is wrong; virtue is an elusive concept, it demands careful and sustained reflection by every man and woman before it can become part of one's life.&lt;ref&gt;Phillip Wagoner, see Foreword, in Srinivasan, Dharma: Hindu Approach to a Purposeful Life, {{ISBN|978-1-62209-672-5}};

Ethics that constitute a [[dharma|dharmic]] life  - that is a moral, ethical, virtuous life - evolve in [[veda]]s and [[upanishad]]s. Ethical subjects and questions are debated by various schools of Hinduism, quite extensively, in numerous texts on what is right conduct, when, how and why.&lt;ref name=agw/&gt; Over time, new virtues were conceptualized and added by ancient Hindu scholars, some replaced, others merged. For example, [[Samhita|Manusamhita]] initially listed ten virtues necessary for a human being to live a ''dharmic'' life: ''Dhriti'' (courage), ''Kshama'' (forgiveness), ''Dama'' (temperance), ''Asteya'' (Non-covetousness/Non-stealing), ''Saucha'' (inner purity), ''Indriyani-graha'' (control of senses), ''dhi'' (reflective prudence), ''vidya'' (wisdom), ''satyam'' (truthfulness), ''[[akrodha]]'' (freedom from anger).&lt;ref&gt;Tiwari, K.

The shorter list of virtues became: ''Ahimsa'' ([[Ahimsa|Non-violence]]), ''Dama'' ([[Temperance (virtue)|self restraint]]), ''Asteya'' (Non-covetousness/Non-stealing), ''Saucha'' (inner purity), ''Satyam'' (truthfulness).&lt;ref&gt;Gupta, B.

The Persian historian [[Abū Rayḥān al-Bīrūnī|Al Biruni]] who visited and lived in India for 16 years in the early 11th century, describes the concept of ethics and virtuous behavior among Hindus of his times. Of ethical mandates among Hindus, a literal translation of his Persian language manuscript includes (1) A man shall not kill; (2) nor lie; (3) nor steal; (4) nor whore; (5) nor hoard up treasures.&lt;ref&gt;Alberuni's India (v. 1), [http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/digital/collections/cul/texts/ldpd_5949073_001/pages/ldpd_5949073_001_00000130.html?toggle=image&amp;menu=maximize&amp;top=&amp;left= Chapter VII], Columbia University Libraries, London :  Kegan Paul, Trübner &amp; Co., (1910), page 73-75&lt;/ref&gt; These correspond to five ''[[Yamas]]'' of ancient Hindu ethics: [[Ahimsa]] (non-violence), [[Satya]] (truth, non-falsehood), [[Asteya]] (non-stealing), [[Brahmacharya]] (celibacy if unmarried and non-cheating on one's partner if married), and [[Aparigraha]] (non-possessiveness).&lt;ref name=ah&gt;Andrea Hornett (2012), Ancient Ethics and Contemporary Systems: The Yamas, the Niyamas and Forms of Organization, in Leadership through the Classics (Editor: Prastacos et al), Springer-Verlag, {{ISBN|978-3-642-32445-1}}, Chapter 5, pages 63-78&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to these five negative things to abstain from, Hindu ethics also recommends five positive things to strive for as ''[[Niyamas]]'': ''[[Shaucha|Śauca]]'' (purity in body, speech and mind), ''Santosha'' (contentment, acceptance of circumstances with optimism), ''[[Tapas (Sanskrit)|Tapas]]'' (perseverance, meditation, austerity), ''Swadhyaya'' (lifelong learning) and ''Pranidhan'' (right attitude, contemplation).&lt;ref name=ah/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B.

Hindu literature variously discuss ethics as one or more of four topics: (1) ''Gunas'' that is inner tendencies of conduct found in every individual (in large measure, psychology); (2) ''Purushartha'' that is proper aims of life for every individual for self-development and happiness ([[dharma]], [[artha]], [[kama]] and [[moksha]]); (3) ''Ashramas'' that is ethics for an individual in different periods of one's lifetime (ethical expectations for a child are distinguished from those for adults, old age); and (4) ''Varnasramas'' that is ethics and conduct for every individual in relation to society.&lt;ref name=agw/&gt; Ancient literature at the foundation of various Hindu traditions primarily discuss the first three, while the last has attracted greater attention since the 18th century. Some early 20th century literature wondered if ethics was ever a serious topic of study in Hinduism.&lt;ref name=wfg&gt;William F. Goodwin, Ethics and Value in Indian Philosophy, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 4, No. 4 (Jan., 1955), pp. 321-344&lt;/ref&gt; Later studies have yielded the above four approaches to ethics in different schools of Hinduism, tied together with three common themes:&lt;ref name=agw/&gt;&lt;ref name=wfg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm Halbfass, Tradition and Reflection - Explorations in Indian Thought, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|0-7914-0362-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1) ethics is an essential part of dharma concept,&lt;ref name=wfg2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arti Dhand (2002), The Dharma of Ethics, the Ethics of Dharma: Quizzing the Ideals of Hinduism, The Journal of Religious Ethics, Vol. 30, No. 3 (Fall, 2002), pp. 347-372&lt;/ref&gt; (2) Ahimsa (non-violence) is the foundational premise without which - suggests Hinduism - ethics and any consistent ethical theory is impossible,&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm Halbfass, Tradition and Reflection - Explorations in Indian Thought, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|0-7914-0362-9}}, pages 87-96, 111-114, 131-257&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B.

Reichenbach (1988), The Law of Karma and the Principle of Causation, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 38, No. 4 (Oct., 1988), pp. 399-410&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roy W. Perrett (1998), Hindu Ethics: A Philosophical Study, University of Hawaii Press, {{ISBN|978-0824820855}}&lt;/ref&gt; state that the [[karma]] doctrine of Hinduism is part of its ethical theory compendium.

The [[Bhagavad Gita]]—considered one of the epitomes of historic Hindu discussion of virtues and an allegorical debate on what is right and what is wrong—argues some virtues are not necessarily always absolute, but sometimes relational; for example, it explains a virtue such as [[Ahimsa]] must be re-examined when one is faced with war or violence from the aggressiveness, immaturity or ignorance of others.&lt;ref&gt;Subedi, S.

==Islamic ethics==
{{Main|Islamic ethics}}{{See also|Halal|Haram}}
The foundational source in the gradual codification of Islamic ethics was the Muslim understanding and interpretations of the mankind has been [[fitrah|granted the faculty to discern]] God's will and to abide by it. This faculty most crucially involves reflecting over the meaning of existence, which, as [[John Kelsay]] in the ''Encyclopedia of Ethics'' phrases, "ultimately points to the reality of God." Therefore, regardless of their environment, humans are believed to have a [[moral responsibility]] to submit to God's will and to follow Islam (as demonstrated in the Qur'an and the [[Sunnah]], or the sayings of Muhammad) {{Quran-usc-range|7|172|173}}).&lt;ref name="EncEthic"&gt;''Islamic ethics'', Encyclopedia of Ethics&lt;/ref&gt;

This natural inclination is, according to the Qur'an, subverted by mankind's focus on material success: such focus first presents itself as a need for basic survival or security, but then tends to manifest into a desire to become distinguished among one's peers. Ultimately, the focus on [[materialism]], according to the Islamic texts, hampers with the innate reflection as described above, resulting in a state of ''[[jahiliyya]]'' or "ignorance."&lt;ref name="EncEthic"/&gt;

Muslims believe that Muhammad, like other [[prophets in Islam]], was sent by God to remind human beings of their moral responsibility, and challenge those ideas in society which opposed submission to God. According to Kelsay, this challenge was directed against five main characteristics of pre-Islamic Arabia:&lt;ref name="EncEthic"/&gt;

# The division of Arabs into varying tribes (based upon blood and kinship). This categorization was confronted by the ideal of a unified community based upon [[taqwa|Islamic piety]], an "''[[ummah]]'';"
# The acceptance of the worship of a multitude of deities besides Allah - a view challenged by strict [[Tawhid|Islamic monotheism]], which dictates that Allah has no partner in worship nor any equal;
# The trait of ''muruwwa'' ([[Macho|manliness]]), which Islam discouraged, instead emphasizing on the traits of humility and piety;
# The focus on achieving fame or establishing a legacy, which was replaced by the concept that mankind would be called to account before God on the [[Qiyamah|day of resurrection]];
# The reverence of and compliance with ancestral traditions, a practice challenged by Islam — which instead assigned primacy to submitting to God and following revelation.

These changes lay in the reorientation of society as regards to identity and life of the Muslim belief, [[world view]], and the hierarchy of values. From the viewpoint of subsequent generations, this caused a great transformation in the society and moral order of life in the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. For Muhammad, although [[pre-Islamic Arabia]] exemplified "heedlessness," it was not entirely without merit. Muhammad approved and exhorted certain aspects of the Arab pre-Islamic tradition, such as the care for one's near kin, for widows, orphans, and others in need and for the establishment of justice. However, these values would be re-ordered in importance and placed in the context of strict [[monotheism]].&lt;ref name="EncEthic"/&gt;

Furthermore, a Muslim should not only follow these five main characteristics, but also be more broad about his morals. Therefore, the more the Muslim is applying these rules, the better that person is morally. For example,Islamic ethics can be applied by important verses in the Quran . The most fundamental characteristics of a Muslim are piety and humility.  A Muslim must be humble with God and with other people:

“And turn not your face away from people (with pride), nor walk in insolence through the earth.  Verily, God likes not each arrogant boaster.  And be moderate (or show no insolence) in your walking, and lower your voice.  Verily, the harshest of all voices is the voice (braying) of the ass.”  (Quran 31:18-19)

Muslims must be in controls of their passions and desires.

A Muslim should not be vain or attached to the ephemeral pleasures of this world. While most people allow the material world to fill their hearts, Muslims should keep God in their hearts and the material world in their hand.  Instead of being attached to the car and the job and the diploma and the bank account, all these things become tools to make us better people.
Morality in Islam addresses every aspect of a Muslim's life, from greetings to international relations.  It is universal in its scope and in its applicability.  Morality reigns in selfish desires, vanity and bad habits.  Muslims must not only be virtuous, but they must also enjoin virtue.  They must not only refrain from evil and vice, but they must also forbid them.  In other words, they must not only be morally healthy, but they must also contribute to the moral health of society as a whole.

“You are the best of the nations raised up for (the benefit of) men; you enjoin what is right and forbid the wrong and believe in God; and if the followers of the Book had believed it would have been better for them; of them (some) are believers and most of them are transgressors.” (Quran: 3:110)

Muhammad summarized the conduct of a Muslim when he said:

“My Sustainer has given me nine commands: to remain conscious of God, whether in private or in public; to speak justly, whether angry or pleased; to show moderation both when poor and when rich, to reunite friendship with those who have broken off with me; to give to him  who refuses me; that my silence should be occupied with thought; that my looking should be an admonition; and that I should command what is right.”

==Jewish ethics==
{{Main|Jewish ethics}}
Jewish ethics may be said to originate with the [[Tanakh|Hebrew Bible]], its broad legal injunctions, wisdom narratives and prophetic teachings. Most subsequent Jewish ethical claims may be traced back to the texts, themes and teachings of the written Torah.

In early rabbinic Judaism, the [[Oral Torah]] both interprets the Hebrew Bible and delves afresh into many other ethical topics. The best known rabbinic text associated with [[ethics]] is the non-legal [[Mishnah]] [[Mishnah|tractate]] of ''[[Pirkei Avot|Avot]]'', popularly translated as ''Ethics of the Fathers''. Generally, ethics is a key aspect of non-legal rabbinic literature, known as [[aggadah]], and ethical teachings are found throughout the more legal ([[halakhic]]) portions of the [[Mishnah]], [[Talmud]] and other rabbinic literature.  This early Rabbinic ethics shows signs of cross-fertilization and polemical exchange with both the Greek (Western philosophical) ethical tradition and early [[Christian]] tradition.

In the medieval period, direct Jewish responses to Greek ethics may be seen in major rabbinic writings. Notably, [[Maimonides]] offers a Jewish interpretation of [[Aristotle]] (e.g., ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]''), who enters into Jewish discourse through Islamic writings. Maimonides, in turn, influences [[Thomas Aquinas]], a dominant figure in Catholic ethics and the [[natural law]] tradition of moral theology. The relevance of natural law to medieval [[Jewish philosophy]] is a matter of dispute among scholars.

===Hellenistic influence===
{{See also|Hellenistic Judaism}}
Ethics in systematic form, and apart from religious belief, is as little found in apocryphal or Judæo-Hellenistic literature as in the Bible. However, Greek philosophy greatly influenced Alexandrian writers such as the authors of [[IV Maccabees]], the [[Book of Wisdom]], and [[Philo]].

Much progress in theoretical ethics came as Jews came into closer contact with the Hellenic world. Before that period the [[Wisdom literature]] shows a tendency to dwell solely on the moral obligations and problems of life as appealing to man as an individual, leaving out of consideration the ceremonial and other laws which concern only the Jewish nation. From this point of view [[Ben Sira]]'s collection of sayings and monitions was written, translated into Greek, and circulated as a practical guide. The book contains popular ethics in proverbial form as the result of everyday life experience, without higher philosophical or religious principles and ideals.

More developed ethical works emanated from [[Hasidean]] circles in the [[Maccabean]] time, such as are contained in [[Book of Tobit|Tobit]], especially in Chapter IV. Here the first [[ethical will]] or testament is found, giving a summary of moral teachings, with the [[Golden Rule]], "Do that to no man which thou hatest!" as the leading maxim. There are even more elaborate ethical teachings in the ''[[Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs]]'', in which each of the twelve sons of Jacob, in his last words to his children and children's children, reviews his life and gives them moral lessons, either warning them against a certain vice he had been guilty of, so that they may avoid divine punishment, or recommending them to cultivate a certain virtue he had practised during life, so that they may win God's favor. The chief virtues recommended are love for one's fellow man, industry, especially in agricultural pursuits, simplicity, sobriety, benevolence toward the poor, compassion even for the brute and avoidance of all passion, pride, and hatred. Similar ethical farewell monitions are attributed to Enoch in the [[Book of Enoch|Ethiopic Enoch]] (xciv. et seq.) and the [[Slavonic Enoch]] (lviii. et seq.) and to the three patriarchs.

The Hellenistic Jewish propaganda literature made the propagation of Jewish ethics taken from the Bible its main object for the sake of winning the pagan world to pure monotheism. It was owing to this endeavor that certain ethical principles were laid down as guiding maxims for the Gentiles, first of all the three capital sins, [[idolatry]], [[murder]], and [[incest]], were prohibited (see Sibyllines, iii. 38, 761; iv. 30 et seq.). In later Jewish [[rabbinic literature]] these [[Noachide Laws]] were gradually developed into six, seven, and ten, or thirty laws of ethics binding upon every human being.

==Germanic Neopagan ethics==
[[Germanic Neopaganism|Germanic Neopagans]], including followers of both [[Asatru]] and [[Theodism]], try to emulate the ethical values of the ancient Germanic peoples ([[Norsemen|Norse]] or [[Anglo-Saxon]]) through the form of the [[Nine Noble Virtues]].

==Scientology ethics==
{{Main|Ethics (Scientology)}}
Scientology ethics is based upon the concepts of [[good and evil]]. Ethics may be defined as the actions an individual takes on itself to ensure its continued survival across the [[Scientology beliefs and practices#The Dynamics|dynamics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scientologyethics.org/scientology-ethics.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-04-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060617232906/http://scientologyethics.org/scientology-ethics.htm |archivedate=2006-06-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Secular ethics==
{{Main|Morality without religion}} {{See also|Secular ethics}}
Secular ethics is a [[moral philosophy]] in which ethics are based solely on human faculties such as scientific reason, sociobiological composition, or ethical intuition, and not derived from purported supernatural revelation or guidance. Secular ethics comprise a wide variety of moral and ethical systems including [[consequentialism]], [[freethinking]], [[humanism]], [[secular humanism]], and [[utilitarianism]], among others.

The majority of secular moral concepts are based on the acceptance of [[natural rights]] and [[social contract]]s, and on a more individual scale of either some form of attribution of intrinsic value to things, [[Immanuel Kant|Kantianesque]] [[ethical intuitionism]] or of a logical deduction that establishes a preference for one thing over another, as with [[Occam's razor]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Approaches such as [[ethical egoism]], [[moral relativism]], [[moral skepticism]], and [[moral nihilism]] are also considered.

==Shinto ethics==
Shinto beliefs start with an assumption of the inherent goodness of humans as descendants of the ''[[kami]]''.&lt;ref name="Bowker 1997 101"&gt;{{cite book |title= World Religions: The Great Faiths Explored &amp; Explained |edition= |last= Bowker|first= John|authorlink= John Bowker (theologian)|year= 1997|publisher= Dorling Kindersley Limited|location= London|isbn= 0-7894-1439-2|page= 101}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 6th century CE, Shinto had drawn from a Chinese idea that good people will adhere to societal norms, and emperors have a divine mandate to bring about the "desirable and required order".&lt;ref name="Bowker 1997 101"/&gt; Shinto adherents are to "realize and carry out the will of the ''kami'' and the ancestors in the family, the community, and the nation".&lt;ref name="Bowker 1997 101"/&gt;

Although State Shinto reinforced subordination to the emperor and the state, Shrine Shinto is a situation-based ethical system that emphasizes right actions toward others, versus adherence to a specific belief system.&lt;ref name="Bowker 1997 108"&gt;{{cite book |title= World Religions: The Great Faiths Explored &amp; Explained |edition= |last= Bowker|first= John|authorlink= John Bowker (theologian)|year= 1997|publisher= Dorling Kindersley Limited|location= London|isbn= 0-7894-1439-2|page= 108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shrine Shinto also stresses gratefulness for "blessings of the ''kami''", and maintaining harmony with the emperor and the world.&lt;ref name="Bowker 1997 108"/&gt;

==Wiccan ethics==
{{Main|Wiccan morality}}
Wiccan morality is largely based on the [[Wiccan Rede]]: 'An' it harm none, do what ye will' -- old-fashioned language for 'as long as you aren't harming anyone, do as you wish'. While this could be interpreted to mean "do no harm at all", it is usually interpreted as a declaration of the freedom to act, along with the necessity of thinking through and taking responsibility for the consequences of one's actions.&lt;ref&gt;Harrow, Judy (1985) [http://www.draknet.com/proteus/rede.htm "Exegesis on the Rede"] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5QgCzLc0I?url=http://www.draknet.com/proteus/rede.htm |date=2007-07-28 }} in ''[[Harvest (Neopagan magazine)|Harvest]]'' vol. 5, Number 3 ([[Oimelc]] 1985). Retrieved 26 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another element of Wiccan Morality comes from the [[Rule of Three (Wiccan)|Law of Threefold Return]], which is understood to mean that whatever one does to another person or thing (benevolent or otherwise) returns with triple force.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], ''High Magic's Aid'', London: Michael Houghton, 1949, p.303&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Wiccans also seek to cultivate a set of eight virtues mentioned in [[Doreen Valiente]]'s ''[[Charge of the Goddess]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Janet Farrar|Farrar, Janet]] &amp; [[Stewart Farrar|Stewart]], ''Eight Sabbats for Witches''.&lt;/ref&gt; these being [[Gladness|mirth]], [[reverence (emotion)|reverence]], [[honour]], [[humility]], strength, [[beauty]], [[Power (sociology)|power]] and [[compassion]]. In Valiente's poem they are ordered in pairs of complementary opposites, reflecting a [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]] that is common throughout Wiccan philosophy.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3829">A '''Faith-based organization''' is an organization whose values are based on faith and/or beliefs, which has a mission based on social values of the particular faith, and which most often draws its activists (leaders, staff, volunteers) from a particular faith group. The faith to which the organization is relating to does not have to be academically classified as [[religion]]. The term "faith-based organization" is more inclusive than the term "[[religious organization]]" as it refers also to the non-congregation faith beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bielefeld|first=Wolfgang|last2=Cleveland|first2=William Suhs|date=2013-06-01|title=Defining Faith-Based Organizations and Understanding Them Through Research|url=http://nvs.sagepub.com/content/42/3/442|journal=Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly|language=en|volume=42|issue=3|pages=442–467|doi=10.1177/0899764013484090|issn=0899-7640}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''His Holiness''' is a style and form of address (in the variant form '''Your Holiness''') for some supreme religious leaders. The title is  most notably used by the [[Pope]], [[Oriental Orthodox]] [[Patriarch]]s, and [[Dalai Lama]].

== Christianity ==
''His Holiness'' ({{lang-lat|Sanctitas}}) is the official [[style (manner of address)|style]] used to address the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[Pope]] and [[Oriental Orthodox]] [[ Patriarch]]s. In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], the [[Ecumenical Patriarch]] of Constantinople has the title of ''His All-Holiness'' (abbreviation HAH).

In February 2013, the [[Holy See]] announced that former [[Pope Benedict XVI]] would retain the style "His Holiness" after resigning and becoming [[Pope Benedict XVI#Pope Emeritus|Pope Emeritus]].
 
The term is sometimes abbreviated to "HH" or "H.H." when confusion with "His/Her Highness" is unlikely. The associated [[form of address]] is "Your Holiness".

Later, it is also used for certain other Eastern Patriarchs, notably those who head a church or rite which recognizes neither Rome's nor Constantinople's primacy.

== Other religions ==
The English language honorific "His Holiness", and as female version "Her Holiness", has commonly been used for [[religious leader]]s from other traditions, including [[Buddhism]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalalberthall.com/tickets/dalai-lama/default.aspx Royal Albert Hall ticket office: His Holiness the Dalai Lama, 19 June 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120715035111/http://www.royalalberthall.com/tickets/dalai-lama/default.aspx |date=15 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (for figures such as the [[Dalai Lama]], the [[Karmapa]], and the [[Je Khenpo]] in [[Bhutan]]), [[Shinto]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asiantribune.com/news/2012/07/02/visit-most-venerable-revudugama-sri-buddharakkitha-thero-japan Asian Tribune: example of reference to "Her Holiness Shinso Ito, the Head Priest of Shinnyo en Temple in Tachikawa, Tokyo", 3 July 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Ahmadiyya]] Islam for the [[Khalifatul Masih|Caliph]] and in [[Dawoodi Bohra]] sect of [[Ismaili]] Shia for esteemed office of [[Da'i Al-Mutlaq]], [[Syedna]].
 
It is also used in certain new [[religious]] movements such as [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishnas]] of [[Hinduism]].

This is an overview of the '''[[history]] of [[theology]]''' in [[Greek philosophy|Greek]] thought and its relationship with [[Abrahamic religions]].

==Ancient Greek and Hellenistic theology ==

===Classical Greek theology ===
&lt;!-- Missing image removed: [[Image:Hesiod.jpg|left|thumb|100px|[[Hesiod]]]] --&gt;Various forms of systematic and philosophical reflection on [[Ancient Greek religion]] and [[Greek mythology]] arose in the classical period—from [[Hesiod]]'s attempts to organize the diverse materials of mythology into a unified ''[[Theogony]]'' to the more properly philosophical analysis reportedly carried out by [[Socrates]].

Influential texts include:
* [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Theogony]]'' (c. 700 BC)
* [[Plato]]'s ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' (c. 360 BC)
* [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' Book Lambda (c. 330 BC)

{{Main|Ancient Greek religion#Theology|l1=Ancient Greek religion, section on Theology}}

===Hellenistic theology ===
[[Image:CiceroBust.jpg|right|thumb|100px|[[Cicero]]]]
{{see also|Greek mythology#Hellenistic rationalism|l1=Greek mythology, Hellenistic rationalism|Ancient Greek religion#Theology}}
Philosophical reflection on the gods, on religion, and on the origins and governance of the Universe, flourished in the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] period among both Greek- and Latin-speaking thinkers.  Among the very diverse movements of Hellenistic philosophy in which theological reflection could be found were [[Skepticism]], [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic]]ism, [[Stoicism]], [[Epicureanism]], [[Middle Platonism]], and [[Neoplatonism]].  The Skeptics were to have a larger impact on Western reasoning than the Cynics; but this would not occur until after its having been reified during the middle years of the Roman Empire when it passed into the mainstream of Western thought.

Influential texts include:
* [[Cleanthes]]' ''Hymn to Zeus'' (3rd century BC)
* [[Cicero]]'s ''[[de Natura Deorum]]'' (45 BC)
* [[Lucretius]]' ''[[On the nature of things|de Rerum Natura]]'' (1st century BC)
* [[Epictetus]]' ''[[Enchiridion of Epictetus|Enchiridion]]'' (135)
* [[Plotinus]]' ''[[Enneads]]'' (c. 235 and after).

Hellenistic theology, which could be deemed to last until the suppression of the [[Athens|Athenian]] [[Academy]] in 529 by [[Justinian I]], overlaps with early Jewish and early Christian theology (see below), and several strands of thought important particularly to early Christian thought arise within Hellenistic circles: attempts to explain the apparent caprice of the gods, [[Atheism]], the development of [[monotheism]], the idea of God as [[first cause]] or [[form of the Good]], the [[mind-body dualism|dualism]] of spirit and matter in humanity, and [[Redemption (religious)|redemption]] (the release of the spirit from its material prison to a higher spiritual world) through knowledge.

==Early Jewish theology==
{{Judaism}}

===The 1st and 2nd centuries===
[[Image:Philon.jpg|left|thumb|100px|[[Philo]]]]Two strands of [[Jewish theology]] develop in the 1st and 2nd centuries.  On the one hand, there are those oral traditions of [[Rabbi]]nic exegesis ([[Midrash]]) and legal discussion ([[Mishnah]] and [[Tosefta]]) that eventually began to be written down towards the end of the 2nd century AD.

Important figures (known as [[Tannaim]]) include
* [[Hillel the Elder]] (working c. 30 BC to 10 AD)
* [[Shamai]] (c. 50 BC to 30 AD)
* [[Gamliel I]] (died c. 50)
* [[Yohanan ben Zakkai]] (1st century AD)
* [[Gamliel II]] (1st century D)
* [[Rabbi Akiva]] (c. 50 to c. 135)
* [[Simeon bar Yohai]] (2nd century AD)
* Rabbi [[Judah haNasi]] (2nd century AD).

On the other hand, there is the attempt to accommodate traditional Jewish exegesis of the Jewish Scriptures and tradition with [[Greek philosophy]]—a strand of thought of which [[Philo]] (c. 20 BC to 40 AD) is the best known proponent. The destruction of the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Jerusalem temple]] in 70 AD and the [[Diaspora|dispersion]] of many Jews from [[Israel]] had a profound effect on Jewish Theology.

===In the period of the Talmud ===
[[Image:V12p022a01 Talmud.jpg|left|thumb|100px|A page of [[Talmud]]]]In the centuries after its compilation, discussion and commentary upon the [[Mishnah]] flourished in Jewish academies in [[Israel]] and in [[Babylon]].  Collections of opinions from these discussions, known as [[Gemara]] were eventually edited together and placed with the Mishnah itself, in both Israel (around 350 AD – the [[Jerusalem Talmud]]) and Babylon (around 550 AD, with further editing in the two centuries that followed – the Babylonian [[Talmud]]).

Important figures (known as [[Amoraim]]) include
* Samuel of Nehardea (Shmuel) (c. 165 – c. 257)
* [[Resh Lakish]] (born c. 200)
* [[Hillel, son of Gamaliel III]] (3rd century)
* [[Abba Arika]] (Rav) (died 247)
* [[Yochanan bar Nafcha|Rabbi Yochanan]] (died c. 279)
* [[Abaye]] (278 – c. 338)
* [[Abbahu]] (died c. 320)
* [[Rav Ashi|Ashi]] (352–427)

==Early Christian theology==

===Theologies of the New Testament===
The [[New Testament]] contains evidence of some of the earliest forms of reflection upon the meanings and implications of Christian faith, mostly in the form of guidance offered to Christian congregations on how to live a life consistent with their convictions – notably in the [[paul of Tarsus|Pauline corpus]] and [[authorship of the Johannine works|Johannine corpus]].

===Patristic theology===
{{main|Patristics}}
A huge quantity of theological reflection emerged in the early centuries of the Christian church – in a wide variety of genres, in a variety of contexts, and in several languages – much of it the product of attempts to discuss how Christian faith should be lived in cultures very different from the one in which it was born.  So, for instance, a good deal of the [[Greek language]] literature can be read as an attempt to come to terms with Hellenistic culture.  The period sees the slow emergence of [[orthodoxy]] (the idea of which seems to emerge from the conflicts between [[catholic]] Christianity and [[gnosticism|Gnostic]] Christianity), the establishment of a [[Biblical canon]], debates about the doctrine of the [[Trinity]] (most notably between the councils of [[First Council of Nicaea|Nicaea]] in 325 and [[First Council of Constantinople|Constantinople]] in 381), about [[Christology]] (most notably between the councils of Constantinople in 381 and  [[Council of Chalcedon|Chalcedon]] in 451), about the purity of the Church (for instance in the debates surrounding the [[Donatist]]s), and about [[Divine grace|grace]], [[free will]] and [[predestination]] (for instance in the debate between [[Augustine of Hippo]] and [[Pelagius (British monk)|Pelagius]]).

Influential texts and writers in the 2nd century include:
* The collection known as the [[Apostolic Fathers]] (mostly 2nd century)
* [[Justin Martyr]] (c. 100/114 – c. 162/168)
* [[Clement of Alexandria]] (died c. 215)
* [[Irenaeus of Lyons]] (c. 130 – 202)
* Various '[[gnosticism|Gnostic]]' authors, such as [[Valentinius]] (c. 100 – c. 153) and [[Basilides]] (c. 117–138)
* Some of the texts commonly referred to as the [[New Testament apocrypha]].

Influential texts and writers between c. 200 and 325 (the [[First Council of Nicaea]]) include:
* [[Tertullian]] (c. 155–230)
* [[Hippolytus (writer)|Hippolytus]] (died 235)
* [[Origen]] (c. 182 – c.251)
* [[Cyprian]] (died c. 258)
* [[Arius]] (256–336)
* Other [[gnosticism|Gnostic]] texts and texts from the [[New Testament apocrypha]].
Texts from patristic authors before 325 AD are collected in the [[Ante-Nicene Fathers]].

[[Image:Saint Augustine of Hippo.jpg|left|thumb|100px|[[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]]]]Influential texts and writers between 325 AD and c. 500 AD include:
* [[Athanasius]] (298–373)
* The [[Cappadocian Fathers]] (late 4th century)
* [[Ambrose]] (c. 340–397)
* [[Jerome]] (c. 347–420)
* [[Chrysostom]] (347–407)
* [[Augustine of Hippo]] (354–430)
* [[Cyril of Alexandria]] (376–444)
Texts from patristic authors after 325 AD are collected in the [[Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers]]. Important theological debates also surrounded the various [[Ecumenical council|Ecumenical Councils]] – [[First Council of Nicaea|Nicaea]] in 325, [[First Council of Constantinople|Constantinople]] in 381, [[First Council of Ephesus|Ephesus]] in 431 and [[Council of Chalcedon|Chalcedon]] in 451
See also main articles on [[Patristics]] and [[Church Fathers]].

==Medieval Christian theology==

===Byzantine theology===
While the Western Roman Empire declined and fell, the Eastern Roman Empire, centred on Constantinople, remained standing until 1453, and was the home of a wide range of theological activity that was seen as standing in strong continuity with the theology of the Patristic period; indeed the division between Patristic and Byzantine theology would not be recognised by many Orthodox theologians and historians.

[[Image:Gregor Palamas.jpg|left|thumb|100px|[[Gregory Palamas]]]]

====Mystical theology====
* [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]] (working c. 500)
* [[Symeon the New Theologian]] (949–1022)
* [[Gregory Palamas]] (1296–1359)

===Western theology===

====Before the Carolingian Empire====
When the [[Roman Empire#The end of the Western Empire|Western Roman Empire fragmented]] under the impact of various 'barbarian' invasions, the Empire-wide intellectual culture that had underpinned late Patristic theology had its interconnections cut.  Theology tended to become more localised, more diverse, more fragmented.  The classically clothed Christianity preserved in Italy by men like [[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boethius]] and [[Cassiodorus]] was different from the vigorous [[Franks|Frankish]] Christianity documented by [[Gregory of Tours]] which was different again from the Christianity that flourished in [[Ireland]] and [[Northumbria]] in the 7th and 8th centuries.  Throughout this period, theology tended to be a more [[monasticism|monastic]] affair, flourishing in monastic havens where the conditions and resources for theological learning could be maintained.

Important writers include:
* [[Caesarius of Arles]] (c. 468–542)
* [[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boethius]] (480–524)
* [[Cassiodorus]] (c. 480 – c. 585)
* [[Pope Gregory I]] (c. 540–604)
* [[Isidore of Seville]] (c. 560–636)
* [[Bede]] (672–736)

====Theology in the time of Charlemagne====
Both because it made communication between different Christian centres easier, and because there was a concerted effort by its rulers to encourage educational and religious reforms and to develop greater uniformity in Christian thought and practice across their territories, the establishment of the [[Carolingian Empire]] saw an explosion of theological inquiry, and theological controversy.  Controversy flared, for instance, around 'Spanish [[Adoptionism]], around the views on predestination of [[Gottschalk (theologian)|Gottschalk]], or around the eucharistic views of [[Ratramnus]].

Important writers include:
* [[Alcuin]] (c. 735–804)
* The Spanish [[Adoptionism|Adoptionists]] [[Felix, Bishop of Urgel|Felix of Urgel]] and [[Elipandus]] of Toledo (late 8th century)
* [[Claudius of Turin]] (?–839)
* [[Rabanus Maurus]] (c. 780–856)
* [[Radbertus]] (c. 790–865)
* [[Ratramnus]] (died c. 868)
* [[Hincmar]] (806–882)
* [[Gottschalk (theologian)|Gottschalk]] (c. 808 – c. 867)
* [[Johannes Scotus Eriugena]] (c. 815–877)

====Before Scholasticism====
With the division and decline of the Carolingian Empire, notable theological activity was preserved in some of the Cathedral schools that had begun to rise to prominence under it – for instance at [[Auxerre]] in the 9th century or [[Chartres]] in the 11th.  Intellectual influences from the Arabic world (including works of classical authors preserved by Islamic scholars) percolated into the Christian West via Spain, influencing such theologians as [[Gerbert of Aurillac]], who went on to become Pope Sylvester II and mentor to [[Otto III]].  (Otto was the fourth ruler of the Germanic [[Ottonian]] [[Holy Roman Empire]], successor to the Carolingian Empire).  With hindsight, one might say that a new note was struck when a controversy about the meaning of the eucharist blew up around [[Berengar of Tours]] in the 11th century: hints of a new confidence in the intellectual investigation of the faith that perhaps foreshadowed the explosion of theological argument that was to take place in the 12th century.

Notable authors include:
* [[Heiric of Auxerre]] (c. 835–887)
* [[Remigius of Auxerre]] (c. 841–908)
* [[Pope Sylvester II|Gerbert of Aurillac]] (c. 950–1003)
* [[Fulbert of Chartres]] (died 1028)
* [[Berengar of Tours]] (c. 999–1088)
* [[Lanfranc]] (died 1089)

====Early Scholasticism and its contemporaries====
[[Anselm of Canterbury]] is sometimes misleadingly called the 'Father of Scholasticism' because of the prominent place that reason has in his theology; instead of establishing his points by appeal to authority, he presents arguments to demonstrate why it is that the things he believes on authority must be so.  His particular approach, however, was not very influential in his time, and he kept his distance from the Cathedral Schools.  We should look instead to the production of the [[Bible gloss|gloss]] on Scripture associated with [[Anselm of Laon]], the rise to prominence of [[dialectic]] (middle subject of the medieval [[trivium (education)|trivium]]) in the work of Abelard, and the production by [[Peter Lombard]] of a collection of [[Sentences]] or opinions of the Church Fathers and other authorities.  Scholasticism proper can be thought of as the kind of theology that emerges when, in the Cathedral schools and their successors, the tools of [[dialectic]] are pressed into use to comment upon, explain, and develop the gloss and the sentences.

Notable authors include:
* [[Anselm of Canterbury]] (1033/1034–1109) 
* [[Anselm of Laon]] (died 1117)
* [[Hugh of St Victor]] (1078–1151)

* [[Hildegard of Bingen]] (1098–1179)
* [[Peter Lombard]] (c. 1100–1160)
* [[Joachim of Fiore]] (c. 1135–1202)

====High Scholasticism and its contemporaries====
The 13th century saw the attempted suppression of various groups perceived as heterodox, such as the [[Cathars]] and [[Waldensians]] and the associated rise of the [[mendicant orders]] (notably the [[Franciscan]]s and [[Dominican order|Dominicans]]), in part intended as a form of orthodox alternative to the heretical groups.  Those two orders quickly became contexts for some of the most intense scholastic theology, producing such 'high scholastic' theologians as [[Alexander of Hales]] (Franciscan) and [[Thomas Aquinas]] (Dominican), or the rather less obviously scholastic [[Bonaventure]] (Franciscan).  The century also saw a flourishing of [[mysticism|mystical theology]], with women such as [[Mechthild of Magdeburg]] playing a prominent role.  In addition, the century can be seen as period in which the study of natural philosophy that could anachronistically be called 'science' began once again to flourish in theological soil, in the hands of such men as [[Robert Grosseteste]] and [[Roger Bacon]].

Notable authors include:
[[Image:St-thomas-aquinas.jpg|left|thumb|100px|[[Aquinas]]]]
* [[Saint Dominic]] (1170–1221)

* [[Bonaventure]] (1221–1274)
* [[Thomas Aquinas]] (1225–1274)
* [[Angela of Foligno]] (1248–1309)

====Late Scholasticism and its contemporaries====
{{See also|Scholasticism}}
Scholastic theology continued to develop as the 13th century gave way to the fourteenth, becoming ever more complex and subtle in its distinctions and arguments.  The 14th century saw in particular the rise to dominance of the [[nominalism|nominalist]] or [[voluntarism (metaphysics)|voluntarist]] theologies of men like [[William of Ockham]].  The 14th century was also a time in which movements of widely varying character worked for the reform of the institutional church, such as [[conciliarism]], [[Lollardy]] and the [[Hussite]]s.  Spiritual movements such as the [[Devotio Moderna]] also flourished.

Notable authors include:

==Islamic theology==
{{Islam}}
{{See also|Islamic theology|Kalam}}

===The beginnings of ''Kalam''===
{{Main|Qadr (doctrine)}}

[[Islamic theology]] or ''[[Kalam]]'', in the sense of ordered, rational reflection upon Allah and his Qur'an, is commonly held to begin at the end of the 7th century – the 1st century A.H. – with debates about divine and human freedom.

The ''[[Qadariyyah]]'' were those who defended a fairly strong view of human freedom, and included
* [[Ma'bad al-Juhani|Ma'bad ibn Khalid al-Juhani]] (died 699)
* [[Ghaylan ibn Marwan al Dimashqi]] (died 749)

'The ''Jabriyyah'' were their opponents, and included
* [[Jahm ibn Safwan (died 745)]]

===''Mu'tazilah''===
The ''Qadariyyah'' evolved into ''Mu‘tazilah'' which for some time was the dominant form of ''kalam'', imposed as official orthodoxy under the [[Abbasid]] dynasty, until the accession of [[Al-Mutawakkil]] in 847, after which it was suppressed.  For the five principal doctrines of Mutazilism, see the [[Mu'tazili#Tenets|main article]].  Prominent Mutazilite theologians include:
* [[Wasil ibn Ata]] (c. 700–748)
* [[Abu Huthail al-‘Allaf]] (c. 750–c.849)	
* Ibrahim [[al-Nazzam]] (died c. 846)
* [[al-Jahiz]] (c. 776–869)
* [[al-Jubba'i]] (died 916)
* [[al-Qadi Abdul Jabbar]] (died 1025)
* [[al-Mawardi]] (974–1058)
* [[Zamakhshari]] (died 1144)

===''Ash'aryah''===
From the late 10th century onwards, ''Mutazilite kalam'', opposition to which had hitherto been almost indistinguishable from opposition to ''kalam'' itself, found a new opponent ''within'' ''kalam'': ''[[Ash'ari]] kalam''.  ''Asharite kalam'' rose to become the dominant form of Islamic ''kalam'', and helped distinguish ''kalam'' from ''falasafa''—from philosophy (a distinction which is less clear when considering ''Mutazilite'' thought).

Prominent Asharites include:

* [[Abu l'Hasan al-Ashari]] (died 945)
* Abu Bakr [[al-Baqillani]] (died 1013)
* [[Abu'l Ma'ali al-Juwayni]] (1028–1085)
* [[Al-Ghazali]] (died 1111)
* [[Fakhr al-Din Razi]] (died 1209)

Note should also be taken of the variant of Asharism known as ''Maturidism''.  Prominent [[Maturidi]] authors include:
* [[Abu Mansur Al Maturidi]] (died 944)
* [[Abu Hafs Umar an-Nasafi|al-Nasafi]] (died 1114)

===''Falasafa'' (Islamic philosophy) ===
Whilst the boundaries are sometimes rather porous, scholars of Islamic thought often make a distinction between ''Falasafa'' ([[Islamic philosophy]]) and ''Kalam'' (Islamic theology).  Prominent writers normally held to stand on the Falasafa side of the divide include:
* [[Al-Kindī]] (died 873)
* [[Al-Razi]] (865–925)
* [[Al-Farabi]] (870–950)
* [[Ibn Miskawayh]] (932–1030)
* Ibn Sina (Latinised form: [[Avicenna]]) (980–1037)
* [[Ibn Hazm]] (994–1069)
* [[Ibn Bajjah]] (died 1138)
* [[Ibn Tufail]] (c. 1110–1185)
* Ibn Rushd (Latinised form: [[Averroes]]) (1126–1198)

==Renaissance "poetic theology"==
[[Renaissance platonism|Renaissance Platonists]], most notably from Florentine circles (from [[Boccaccio]] and [[Petrarch]], to [[Cristoforo Landino|Landino]] and [[Politian]]), appealed to "poetic theology" ([[Theologia Poetica|theologia poetica]]) as a mythical theology independent of Biblical revelation  and thus, too, of Christian medieval theology.  The paradigmatic "poet theologian" was [[Orpheus]], a mythical legislator capable of subduing or civilizing beast-like men with his songs. Renaissance philosophers would adopt mythical ''personae'' such as that of Orpheus to carry out their civilizing function, as philosophical mediators between "sacred" authority and the "profane" lives subject to it.  Thus, e.g., Politian would emerge as a "new Orpheus", a philosopher in poetic garb.

The Renaissance judicious appeal to [[Theologia Poetica|theologia poetica]] would find its historical consummation in the works of [[Giambattista Vico]], whose discussions on "poet theologians" ([[Scienza Nuova]]) echoed Renaissance counterparts both literally and allegorically.

==Reformation and Counter-Reformation Christian theology==
[[Image:Martin_Luther,_1529.jpg|thumb|100px|Martin Luther]]
The [[Renaissance]] yielded scholars the ability to read the scriptures in their original languages and this in part stimulated the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], a theological movement that [[Protestation at Speyer|protested]] the outlawing of their faith at the [[Second Diet of Speyer]]. Its main themes were [[Sola fide|Justification by faith]], the [[Sola Scriptura|Bible as the only source of Christian teaching]], and the [[Priesthood of all believers]], and. Important figures include [[Martin Luther|Luther]], [[Philipp Melanchthon|Melanchthon]],  [[Martin Bucer|Bucer]], [[Huldrych Zwingli|Zwingli]], [[John Calvin|Calvin]], and the [[Anabaptists]]. [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] theology was developed by successors such as [[Theodore Beza|Beza]], the English [[Puritans]] and [[Francis Turretin|Turretin]]. [[Lutheranism#Summary of doctrine|Lutheran theology]] entered a [[Lutheran Orthodoxy|period]] of doctrinal unity with the adoption of the [[Book of Concord]] and preserved it through the work of theologians such as [[Martin Chemnitz|Chemnitz]] and [[Johann Gerhard|Gerhard]].

The Roman Catholic [[Counter-Reformation]] spearheaded by the [[Jesuits]] under [[Ignatius Loyola]] took their theology from the decisions of the [[Council of Trent]] and developed [[Second scholasticism|Second Scholasticism]], which they pitted against [[Lutheran scholasticism|Lutheran]] and [[Reformed scholasticism]]. The overall result of the Reformation was to highlight distinctions of belief that had previously co-existed uneasily.

The [[Fall of Constantinople]] in the East, 1453, led to a significant shift of gravity to the rising state of [[Russia]], the "Third Rome". The Renaissance stimulated a program of reforms by patriarchs of prayer books. A movement called the "[[Old Believers]]" consequently resulted and influenced [[Russian Orthodox]] Theology in the direction of [[conservatism]] and [[Erastianism]].

==Modern Christian theology==
[[Image:Kierkegaard.jpg|thumb|100px|[[Søren Kierkegaard]]]]
After the Reformation [[protestant]] groups continued to splinter, leading to a range of new theologies. The "[[Enthusiasts]]" were so named because of their emotional zeal. These included the [[Methodists]], the [[Quakers]] and [[Baptists]]. Another group sought to reconcile Christian faith with "Modern" ideas, sometimes causing them to reject beliefs they considered to be illogical, including the [[Nicene creed]] and [[Chalcedonian Creed]]. these included [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]] and [[Universalists]]. A major issue for Protestants became the degree to which Man contributes to his salvation. The debate is often viewed as [[synergism (theology)|synergism]] versus [[monergism]], though the labels [[Calvinist]] and [[Arminian]] are more frequently used, referring to the conclusion of the [[Synod of Dort]].

The 19th century saw the rise of [[biblical criticism]], new knowledge of religious [[Multiculturalism|diversity]] in other continents and above all the growth of [[science]]. This led many church men to espouse a form of [[Deism]]. This, along with concepts such as the brotherhood of man and a rejection of [[miracle]]s led to what is called "[[Liberal Christianity|Classical liberalism]]". Immensely influential in its day, classic liberalism suffered badly as a result of the two [[world wars]] and fell prey to the criticisms of [[postmodernism]].

[[Vladimir Lossky]] is a famous [[Eastern Orthodox]] theologian writing in the 20th century for the Greek church.

==Postmodern theology==
[[Postmodern theology]] seeks to respond to the challenges of post modern and deconstructionist thought, and has included the [[death of God]] movement, [[process theology]], [[feminist theology]] and [[queer theology]] and most importantly [[Neo-orthodox]] theology. [[Karl Barth]], [[Rudolf Bultmann]] and [[Reinhold Niebuhr]] were Neo-Orthodoxy's main representatives. In particular Barth labeled his theology "dialectical theology", a reference to [[existentialism]].

The predominance of classic liberalism resulted in many [[reactionary]] movements amongst conservative believers. [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] theology, [[Pentecostal]] or Renewal theology and [[fundamentalist]] theology, often combined with [[dispensationalism]], all moved from the fringe into the academy. [[Marxism]] stimulated the significant rise of [[liberation theology]]  which can be interpreted as a rejection of Academic Theology that fails to challenge [[the establishment]] and help the poor.

From the late 19th century to the early twentieth groups established themselves that derived many of their beliefs from Protestant evangelical groups but significantly differed in doctrine. These include the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], the [[Latter Day Saint]]s and others. Many of these groups use the Protestant version of the bible and typically interpret it in a fundamentalist fashion, adding, however, special prophecy or scriptures, and typically denying the trinity and the full deity of Jesus Christ.

[[Ecumenical]] theology sought to discover a common consensus on theological matters that could bring the many [[Christian denominations]] together. As a movement it was successful in helping to provide a basis for the establishment of the [[World Council of Churches]] and for some reconciliation between more established denominations. But ecumenical theology was nearly always the concern of liberal theologians, especially Protestant ones. The movement for ecumenism was opposed especially by fundamentalists and viewed as flawed by many neo-orthodox and [[confessional Lutheran]] theologians.

The pattern of challenge from a changing world, liberal response from official representatives and orthodox backlash from conservatives is found also in the history of Islam and Judaism. [[Reform Judaism]] represents a liberal interpretation as against [[Orthodox Judaism]], and moderate or [[liberal Islam]] continues to be theologically distinct from [[Islamic fundamentalism]], notably its [[Wahhabism|Wahabi]] and [[Deobandi]] Schools.

The '''Holy Land''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: {{lang|he|אֶרֶץ הַקּוֹדֶשׁ}} {{transl|he|''Eretz HaKodesh''}}, {{lang-la|Terra Sancta}}; [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: {{lang|ar|الأرض المقدسة}} {{transl|ar|''Al-Arḍ Al-Muqaddasah''}} or {{lang|ar|الديار المقدسة}} {{transl|ar|''Ad-Diyar Al-Muqaddasah''}}) is an area roughly located between the [[Jordan River]] and the [[Mediterranean Sea]] that also includes the Eastern Bank of the Jordan River. Traditionally, it is synonymous with both the biblical [[Land of Israel]] and historical [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. The term usually refers to a territory roughly corresponding to the modern [[State of Israel]], the [[Palestinian territories]], western [[Jordan]], and parts of southern [[Lebanon]] and southwestern [[Syria]]. It is considered [[holy]] by [[Jews]], [[Christian]]s, and [[Muslim]]s.

Part of the significance of the land stems from the [[religious significance of Jerusalem]], the holiest city to [[Judaism]], the historical region of [[Ministry of Jesus|Jesus' ministry]], and the site of the [[Isra and Mi'raj]] event in [[Islam]].

The holiness of the land to Christianity was part of the motivation for the [[Crusades]], as European Christians sought to win back the Holy Land from the Muslims, who had [[Muslim conquests|conquered it]] from the Christian [[Byzantine Empire]].

Many sites in the Holy Land have long been [[pilgrimage]] destinations for adherents of the [[Abrahamic religions]], including Jews, Christians, Muslims, and [[Bahá'ís]]. [[Pilgrim]]s visit the Holy Land to touch and see physical manifestations of their [[faith]], confirm their beliefs in the holy context with collective excitation, and connect personally to the Holy Land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael Sebastian |last=Metti |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Jerusalem - the most powerful brand in history |url=http://www.metti-bronner.com/Jerusalem.pdf |work=[[Stockholm University School of Business]] |publisher= |date=2011-06-01 |accessdate=1 July 2011 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jews do not commonly refer to the [[Land of Israel]] as "Holy Land" ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: {{lang|he|אֶרֶץ הַקוֹדֵשׁ}} {{transl|he|''Eretz HaKodesh''}}). The [[Tanakh]] explicitly refers to it as "holy land" in only one passage.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Zechariah|2:16|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "holy land" is further used twice in the deuterocanonical books.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Wisdom|12:3|NRSV}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||2 Maccabees|1:7|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt; The holiness of the Land of Israel is generally implied in the Tanakh by the Land being given to the [[Israelites]] by God, that is, it is the "[[promised land]]", an integral part of [[Covenant (biblical)|God's covenant]]. In the [[Torah]] many [[mitzvot]] commanded to the Israelites can only be performed in the Land of Israel,&lt;ref&gt;Aharon Ziegler, ''Halakhic positions of Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik: Volume 4'', KTAV Publishing House, 2007, p.173&lt;/ref&gt; which serves to differentiate it from other lands. For example, in the Land of Israel, "no land shall be sold permanently" (Lev. 25:23). [[Shmita]] is only observed with respect to the land of Israel, and the observance of many [[Jewish holiday|holy]] days is different, as an extra day is observed in the [[Jewish diaspora]].

According to [[Eliezer Schweid]]:
{{quote|The uniqueness of the Land of Israel is...'geo-theological' and not merely climatic. This is the land which faces the entrance of the spiritual world, that sphere of existence that lies beyond the physical world known to us through our senses. This is the key to the land's unique status with regard to prophecy and prayer, and also with regard to the commandments&lt;ref&gt;''The Land of Israel: National Home Or Land of Destiny'', By Eliezer Schweid, Translated by Deborah Greniman, Published 1985 Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press, {{ISBN|0-8386-3234-3}}, p.56.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

From the perspective of the 1906 [[Jewish Encyclopedia]], the holiness of Israel had been concentrated since the sixteenth century, especially for burial, in the "[[Four Holy Cities]]": [[Jerusalem]], [[Hebron]], [[Safed]] and [[Tiberias]] - as [[Judaism]]'s holiest cities.

According to Jewish tradition, Jerusalem is Mount [[Moriah]], the location of the [[binding of Isaac]]. The [[Hebrew Bible]] mentions the name "[[Jerusalem]]" 669 times, often because many mitzvot can only be performed within its environs. The name "[[Zion]]", which usually refers to Jerusalem, but sometimes the Land of Israel, appears in the Hebrew Bible 154 times.

The [[Talmud]] mentions the religious duty of colonising Israel.&lt;ref name="Herzog1967"&gt;{{cite book|author=Isaac Herzog|title=The Main Institutions of Jewish Law: The law of obligations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eq3XAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=27 June 2011|year=1967|publisher=Soncino Press|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; So significant in Judaism is the act of purchasing land in Israel, the Talmud allows for the lifting of certain religious restrictions of [[Shabbat|Sabbath]] observance to further its acquisition and settlement.&lt;ref name="Zahavi1962"&gt;{{cite book|author=Yosef Zahavi|title=Eretz Israel in rabbinic lore (Midreshei Eretz Israel): an anthology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yK7hAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=19 June 2011|year=1962|publisher=Tehilla Institute|page=28|quote=If one buys a house from a non-Jew in Israel, the title deed may be written for him even on the Sabbath.

Eleazar b. Shammua' and R. [[Johanan HaSandlar]] left Israel to study from R. [[Judah ben Bathyra]], they only managed to reach [[Sidon]] when "the thought of the sanctity of Palestine overcame their resolution, and they shed tears, rent their garments, and turned back".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Due to the Jewish population being concentrated in Israel, emigration was generally prevented, which resulted in a limiting of the amount of space available for Jewish learning. However, after suffering persecutions in Israel for centuries after the destruction of the Temple, Rabbis who had found it very difficult to retain their position moved to Babylon, which offered them better protection. Many Jews wanted Israel to be the place where they died, in order to be buried there. The sage Rabbi Anan said "To be buried in Israel is like being buried under the altar."&lt;ref name="first"/&gt;&lt;ref name="(Translator)2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gil1997"/&gt; The saying "His land will absolve His people" implies that burial in Israel will cause one to be absolved of all one's sins.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/11867-palestine-holiness-of|title=PALESTINE, HOLINESS OF - JewishEncyclopedia.com|last=|first=|date=|website=www.jewishencyclopedia.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/3364937/jewish/Why-Do-Jews-Fly-Their-Dead-to-Israel-for-Burial.htm|title=Why Do Jews Fly Their Dead to Israel for Burial?|website=www.chabad.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Holy sepulchre mass.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|The [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] is one of the most important pilgrimage sites in Christianity, as it is the purported site of Christ's resurrection.]]
[[File:Tebnine11.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Crusader castle of [[Toron]] in the village of [[Tebnine|Tibnin]], [[Lebanon]]]]

For [[Christian]]s, the [[Land of Israel]] is considered holy because of its association with the [[Birth of Jesus|birth]], ministry, [[crucifixion]] and [[Death and Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]] of [[Jesus]], whom Christians regard as the Savior or [[Messiah]], and because it is the land of the Jewish people (according to the Bible). Christian books, including editions of the Bible, often had maps of the Holy Land (considered to be Galilee, Samaria, Judea). For instance, the ''Itinerarium Sacrae Scripturae'' (Travel book through Holy Scripture) of Heinrich Bünting (1545-1606), a German Protestant pastor, featured such a map.&lt;ref name="wdl"/&gt; His book was very popular, and it provided "the most complete available summary of biblical geography and described the geography of the Holy Land by tracing the travels of major figures from the Old and New testaments."&lt;ref name="wdl"&gt;{{cite web|title=Description of the Holy Land|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/2891/|website=[[World Digital Library]]|date=1585|language=German|author1=Bünting, Heinrich}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a geographic term, the description "Holy Land" loosely encompasses modern-day [[Israel]], the [[Palestinian territories]], [[Lebanon]], western [[Jordan]] and south-western [[Syria]].

{{See also|Jerusalem in Islam|Syria (region)}}
In the [[Qur'an]], the term {{lang-ar|'''الأرض المقدسة'''}} ({{transl|ar|''Al-Ard Al-Muqaddasah''}}, {{lang-en|"Holy Land"}}) is used in a passage about [[Moses in Islam|Musa]] ([[Moses]]) proclaiming to the [[Children of Israel]]: "O my people! Enter the holy land which [[Allah]] hath assigned unto you, and turn not back ignominiously, for then will ye be overthrown, to your own ruin." ([[wikisource:The Holy Qur'an/Al-Meada|Surah 5:21]]) The Quran also refers to the land as being 'Blessed'.&lt;ref name="Cite quran|17|1|e=16|s=ns"&gt;{{cite quran|17|1|e=16|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cite quran|21|51|e=82|s=ns"&gt;{{cite quran|21|51|e=82|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cite quran|34|10|e=18|s=ns"&gt;{{cite quran|34|10|e=18|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jerusalem]] (referred to as ''Al-Quds'' ({{lang-ar|الـقُـدس}}, "The Holy")) has particular significance in Islam. The Quran refers to [[Muhammad]]'s experiencing the [[Isra and Mi'raj]] as "a Journey by night from ''[[Masjid Al-Haram|Al-Masjidil-Haram]]'' to ''[[Masjid Al-Aqsa|Al-Masjidil-Aqsa]]'', whose precincts We did bless ..." (17:1).&lt;ref name="Cite quran|17|1|e=16|s=ns"/&gt; ''[[Ahadith]]'' infer that the "Farthest Masjid" is in Al-Quds; for example, as narrated by [[Abu Huraira]]h: "On the night journey of the Apostle of Allah, two cups, one containing wine and the other containing milk, were presented to him at Al-Quds (Jerusalem). He looked at them and took the cup of milk. Angel Gabriel said, "Praise be to Allah, who guided you to Al-Fitrah (the right path); if you had taken (the cup of) wine, your ''[[Ummah]]'' would have gone astray". However, some modern scholars argue that the 'Farthest Mosque' was a building or prayer-site just outside [[Medina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3596681,00.html|title=The myth of al-Aqsa:Holiness of Jerusalem to Islam has always been politically motivated|website=Ynetnews|date=15 Sep 2008|author=[[Mordechai Kedar]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/temples.html|title=The Jewish Temples: The Temples of Jerusalem in Islam|author=[[Martin Kramer]]|website=Jewish Virtual Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; The present building of Al-Masjid Al-Aqsa in Jerusalem had not been built in Muhammad's day, and the Quran does not contain any other reference to Jerusalem, apart from the reference to the change of the ''[[Qibla]]h'' from Jerusalem to Mecca. [[Jerusalem]] was Islam's first ''Qiblah'' (direction of prayer) in Muhammad's lifetime, however, this was later changed to the [[Kaaba]] in the [[Hijaz]]i city of [[Mecca]], following a revelation to Muhammad by the Archangel [[Jibril]],&lt;ref name="Cite quran|2|142|e=177|s=ns"&gt;{{cite quran|2|142|e=177|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; by which it is understood by scholars {{who|date=February 2016}} that it was in answer to the rejection by the Jews of Muhammed's Prophetship.

The exact region referred to as being 'blessed' in the Qur'an, in verses like [17:1], [21:71] and [34:18],&lt;ref name="Cite quran|17|1|e=16|s=ns"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cite quran|21|51|e=82|s=ns"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cite quran|34|10|e=18|s=ns"/&gt; has been interpreted differently by various scholars. [[Abdullah Yusuf Ali]] likens it to a wide land-range including [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]], especially the cities of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] and [[Sidon]]; Az-Zujaj describes it as, ''"[[Damascus]], Palestine, and a bit of [[Jordan]]"''; [[Muadh ibn Jabal]] as, ''"the area between [[al-Arish]] and the [[Euphrates]]"''; and [[Ibn Abbas]] as, ''"the land of [[Jericho]]"''.&lt;ref&gt;Ali (1991), p. 934&lt;/ref&gt; This overall region is referred to as "[[Ash-Shām]]" ({{lang-ar|الـشَّـام}}).&lt;ref name="Volume 9 1997 page 261"&gt;Article "AL-SHĀM" by [[C.E. Bosworth]], ''[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]'', Volume 9 (1997), page 261.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Salibi2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kamal S.

From the classical perspective however Syria, including Palestine, formed no more than the western fringes of what was reckoned to be Arabia between the first line of cities and the coast. Since there is no clear dividing line between what are called today the Syrian and Arabian deserts, which actually form one stretch of arid tableland, the classical concept of what actually constituted Syria had more to its credit geographically than the vaguer Arab concept of Syria as Bilad al-Sham. Under the Romans, there was actually a province of Syria. with its capital at Antioch, which carried the name of the territory. Otherwise. down the centuries, Syria like Arabia and Mesopotamia was no more than a geographic expression. In Islamic times, the Arab geographers used the name arabicized as Suriyah, to denote one special region of Bilad al-Sham, which was the middle section of the valley of the Orontes river, in the vicinity of the towns of Homs and Hama. They also noted that it was an old name for the whole of Bilad al-Sham which had gone out of use. As a geographic expression, however, the name Syria survived in its original classical sense in Byzantine and Western European usage, and also in the Syriac literature of some of the Eastern Christian churches, from which it occasionally found its way into Christian Arabic usage. It was only in the nineteenth century that the use of the name was revived in its modern Arabic form, frequently as Suriyya rather than the older Suriyah, to denote the whole of Bilad al-Sham: first of all in the Christian Arabic literature of the period, and under the influence of Western Europe. By the end of that century it had already replaced the name of Bilad al-Sham even in Muslim Arabic usage.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4452">'''Infallibilism''', in [[epistemology]], is the idea that propositional [[knowledge]] is incompatible with a chance of being wrong, where this is typically understood as one's evidence or justification providing one's [[belief]] with such strong grounds that it must be [[truth|true]] and perhaps cannot be rationally doubted. Other beliefs may be rationally [[Theory of justification|justified]], but they do not rise to the level of ''knowledge'' unless absolutely certain given one's evidence. Infallibilism's opposite, [[fallibilism]], is the position that a justified true belief may be considered knowledge, even if one's evidence does not guarantee its truth, or can, given one's evidence, rationally doubt it. 

Fallibilism is not to be confused with [[philosophical skepticism|skepticism]], which is the belief that knowledge is unattainable for rational human beings. [[René Descartes]], an early proponent of infallibilism argued, “my reason convinces me that I ought not the less carefully to withhold belief from what is not entirely certain and indubitable, than from what is manifestly false”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Meditations on First Philosophy|last = Descartes|first = Rene|publisher = |year = 1641|isbn = 978-0-415-07707-1|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Infallibilism can be expressed in logic as "if I know that p, then I can't be mistaken about p".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://documents.routledge-interactive.s3.amazonaws.com/9781138793934/A2/Descartes/DescartesInfallibilismCartesiancircle.pdf|title = Infallibilism and the Cartesian circle|last = Lacewing|first = Michael|date = 2013|journal = A Level Philosophy|pmid = |access-date = Oct 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Fallibilism is endorsed by most contemporary epistemologists,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://courses.washington.edu/dbt560/Fallibilism.pdf|title = How to Think about Fallibilism|date = 7 June 2001|accessdate = Oct 11, 2015|website = University of Washington Course Server|publisher = |last = Reed|first = Baron}}&lt;/ref&gt; though many in epistemology have recently presented significant arguments against fallibilism, and for infalliblism.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Mark Kaplan, "If you know you can't be wrong," in {{cite book |last1=Hetherington |first1=Stephen |title=Epistemology Futures |date=2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=180-198 |url=https://philpapers.org/rec/KAPIYK}}; see also {{Cite journal|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11229-010-9815-2|title = Warrant does entail truth|last = Moon|first = Andrew|date = 2012|journal = Synthese|doi = 10.1007/s11229-010-9815-2|pmid = |access-date = Oct 11, 2015|volume=184|pages=287–297}}; {{cite journal |last1=Dutant |first1=Julien |title=How to Be an Infallibilist |journal=Philosophical Issues |date=2016 |volume=26 |pages=148-171 |doi=10.1111/phis.12085 |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/phis.12085}}; and {{cite journal |last1=Benton |first1=Matthew |title=Knowledge, Hope, and Fallibilism |journal=Synthese |date=2018 |pages=1-17 |doi=10.1007/s11229-018-1794-8 |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11229-018-1794-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[religion]], infallibilism is the belief that certain texts or persons are incapable of being in the wrong. The most famous example of this is probably the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] doctrine of [[papal infallibility]], under which the [[Pope]] is considered infallible in certain matters of doctrine, when his decisions are promulgated ''[[ex cathedra]]''. Since 1870, the Catholic Church has officially declared that its earthly head, the Pope, in certain circumstances, is so grounded in the mission of the church that he teaches "infallibly".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://moses.creighton.edu/csrs/news/F96-1.html|title = The History and Future of Papal Infallibility|last = Burke|first = Ronald|date = Fall 1996|work = |access-date = Oct 10, 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Papal infallibility also belongs to the body of [[bishop]]s as a whole, when, in doctrinal unity with the pope, they solemnly teach a doctrine as true.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.catholic.com/tracts/papal-infallibility|title = Papal Infallibility|date = August 10, 2004|accessdate = Oct 11, 2015|website = Catholic Answers|publisher = |last = Brom|first = Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Invisible Pink Unicorn''' ('''IPU''') is the [[goddess]] of a [[parody religion]] used to [[Satire|satirize]] [[Theism|theistic]] beliefs, taking the form of a [[unicorn]] that is [[paradox]]ically both [[Invisibility|invisible]] and [[pink]].&lt;ref name=Angeles1992/&gt; She is a rhetorical illustration used by [[Atheism|atheists]] and other [[religious skepticism|religious skeptics]] as a contemporary version of [[Russell's teapot]], sometimes mentioned in conjunction with the [[Flying Spaghetti Monster]].&lt;ref name=Maartens2006/&gt;

The IPU is used to argue that [[supernatural]] beliefs are arbitrary by, for example, replacing the word ''[[God]]'' in any theistic statement with ''Invisible Pink Unicorn''.&lt;ref name=Narciso2004/&gt; The mutually exclusive attributes of pinkness and invisibility, coupled with the inability to disprove the IPU's existence, satirize properties that some theists attribute to a theistic [[deity]].&lt;ref name=AbelSchaefer2010/&gt;

== History ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Invisible pink unicorn.svg|thumb|The Invisible Pink Unicorn logo]] --&gt;
[[Russell's teapot]] is an [[analogy]] first coined by the philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]] (1872–1970) to illustrate that the [[philosophic burden of proof]] lies upon a person making scientifically [[Falsifiability|unfalsifiable]] claims rather than shifting the burden of proof to others, specifically in the case of religion.&lt;ref&gt;Fritz Allhoff, Scott C. Lowe. ''The Philosophical Case Against Literal Truth: Russell's Teapot // Christmas - Philosophy for Everyone: Better Than a Lump of Coal''. — John Wiley and Sons, 2010. — Т. 5. — P. 65-66. — 256 p. — (Philosophy for Everyone). — {{ISBN|9781444330908}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Russell wrote that, if he claims that a [[teapot]] orbits the Sun somewhere in space between the Earth and Mars, it is nonsensical for him to expect others to believe him on the ground that they cannot prove him wrong. Russell's teapot is still referred to in discussions concerning the [[existence of God]].

The IPU seems to have become notable primarily through online culture: in addition to [[alt.atheism]], where IPU still frequently{{Citation needed|reason=Still as of when? How frequently?|date=October 2018}} comes up in discussions, there are now a number of web sites dedicated to her. An early documented reference to the IPU was on July 7, 1990, on the [[Usenet]] discussion group alt.atheism.&lt;ref name=Gibson1990/&gt; Other sources concerning IPU state that she was "revealed to us" on alt.atheism.

The concept was further developed by a group of college students from 1994 to 1995 on the [[ISCABBS|ISCA]] [[Telnet]]-based [[Bulletin board system|BBS]]. The students created a [[manifesto]] that detailed a nonsensical (yet internally consistent) religion based on a multitude of invisible pink unicorns.&lt;ref name=Ashman2007/&gt; It is from this document that the most famous quotation concerning IPUs originated:

{{quote|
Invisible Pink Unicorns are beings of great spiritual power. We know this because they are capable of being invisible and pink at the same time. Like all religions, the Faith of the Invisible Pink Unicorns is based upon both logic and faith. We have faith that they are pink; we logically know that they are invisible because we can't see them.|Serah Eley&lt;ref name=PolingPoolePoling2003/&gt;&lt;ref name=Huberman2006/&gt;

[[File:Ipu.png|thumb|This image features a pink unicorn but it has an [[alpha compositing|alpha channel]] that makes the unicorn transparent, thus approximating the appearance of the Invisible Pink Unicorn. Blank images have been humorously presented as depictions of the Invisible Pink Unicorn in order to highlight her invisibility.&lt;ref name=klog2005/&gt;]]

It is common when discussing the Invisible Pink Unicorn to point out that because she is invisible, no one can [[Falsifiability|prove]] that she does not exist (or indeed that she is not pink). This is a parody of similar theistic claims about God—that God, as creator of the universe, is not subject to its laws and thus not physically detecting him tells us nothing about his existence or lack thereof. The Invisible Pink Unicorn is an illustration which attempts to demonstrate the absurdity of citing attributes and a lack of evidence as proof of a deity's existence. Her two defining attributes, invisibility and color (pink), are inconsistent and contradictory; this is part of the satire. The paradox of something being invisible yet having visible characteristics (e.g., [[color]]) is reflected in some [[East Asia]]n cultures, wherein an [[Red string of fate|invisible red string]] is said to connect people who have a shared or linked [[destiny]].

There are humorous mock debates amongst her "followers" concerning her other attributes, such as whether she is completely invisible, or invisible to most, but visible to those who have faith in her (bearing similarities to "[[The Emperor's New Clothes]]").&lt;ref name=Ashman2007/&gt; Some arguments are quite elaborate and tortuous, satirizing the disputatiousness and intricacy of the theological debates that occur in many religions.&lt;ref name=Ashman2007/&gt;

The Invisible Pink Unicorn is also used to de-deify religious texts. The goal is to have the reader experience the text without heavily loaded concepts that many readers will associate with omnipotence, or will read with an unquestioned faith. It is argued that when someone re-reads the same text with all direct references to God replaced with the Invisible Pink Unicorn, the reader may see the text in a new and more critical way:

In 1996, a unicorn that no one can see was adapted as a teaching device at [[Camp Quest]], the first free-thought summer camp for children established in the [[United States]], by Dr. L. Wilson. As reported years later in the July 21, 2006 ''Cincinnati Enquirer'', "Campers must try to prove that imaginary unicorns—as a metaphor for God—don't exist."&lt;ref name=Clark2006/&gt;
[[Richard Dawkins]] alluded to unicorns in this connection in his 2006 book ''[[The God Delusion]]'', writing that "[[Russell's teapot]], of course, stands for an infinite number of things whose existence is conceivable and cannot be disproved. [...] A philosophical favorite is the invisible, intangible, inaudible unicorn."&lt;ref name=Dawkins2006/&gt;

In the essay ''The Dragon in my Garage'' from the book ''[[The Demon-Haunted World|The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle In the Dark]]'', [[Carl Sagan]] uses the example of an invisible dragon breathing heatless fire that someone claims lives in his garage. The supposed dragon cannot be seen, heard, or sensed in any way, nor does it leave footprints. There is no reason to believe this purported dragon exists.&lt;ref name=Sagan1997/&gt;

In the ''[[South Park]]'' episode "[[The Poor Kid]]", a strict agnostic couple tell their foster children that God ''might'' exist, but then again, it's equally possible that there might be a "giant reptilian bird in charge of everything". At the end of the episode, the bird actually does appear and eats [[Kenny (South Park)|Kenny]].

==Religious commentary==
The Church of the Invisible Pink Unicorn often faces criticism from monotheistic religions for comparing their sacred beings with a fantastic invented character as well as trying to masquerade it as a religion while lacking the scripture, principles, ideologies, and broader social community necessary to be considered a legitimate religion. Many followers have responded to these critiques by improvising new literature, rituals, and customs, frequently written as farcical narrative that parodies not only scripture and rites itself but also the perceived importance or relevance of such scripture and customs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theinvisiblepinkunicorn.com/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124080122/http://www.theinvisiblepinkunicorn.com/ |archivedate=2010-11-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Invisible Pink Unicorn scripture and customs seek to evoke the mysticism of the unicorn and to simultaneously lampoon similar literature in [[Christianity|other faiths]] per the IPU's main tenet.

{{Judaism}}

'''Judaism''' (originally from [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] {{Hebrew|יהודה}}, ''Yehudah'', "[[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]]";&lt;ref name="bibleinterp_mason3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="askoxford" /&gt; via [[Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]) is the religion of the [[Jews|Jewish people]]. It is an ancient, [[monotheistic]], [[Abrahamic religion]] with the [[Torah]] as its foundational text.&lt;ref name="uncertainties" /&gt; It encompasses the [[religion]], [[philosophy]], and [[culture]] of the [[Jewish people]].&lt;ref name="Judaism" /&gt; Judaism is considered by religious Jews to be the expression of the [[Mosaic covenant|covenant]] that [[God in Judaism|God]] established with the [[Children of Israel]].&lt;ref name="Knowledge Resources: Judaism" /&gt; Judaism encompasses a wide corpus of texts, practices, theological positions, and forms of organization. The Torah is part of the larger text known as the [[Tanakh]] or the [[Hebrew Bible]], and supplemental oral tradition represented by later texts such as the [[Midrash]] and the [[Talmud]]. With between 14.5 and 17.4&amp;nbsp;million adherents worldwide,&lt;ref name="Population of Jews" /&gt; Judaism is [[Major religious groups#Religious demographics|the tenth largest religion in the world]].

Within Judaism there are a variety of movements, most of which emerged from [[Rabbinic Judaism]], which holds that God revealed his laws and [[613 Mitzvot|commandments]] to [[Moses]] on [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]] in the form of both the [[Torah|Written]] and [[Oral Torah]].&lt;ref name="What is the oral Torah?" /&gt; Historically, this assertion was challenged by various groups such as the [[Sadducees#General|Sadducees]] and [[Hellenistic Judaism]] during the [[Second Temple period]]; the [[Karaite Judaism#Karaite interpretations of the Torah|Karaites]] and [[Sabbateans]] during the early and later medieval period;&lt;ref name="Karaite Jewish University" /&gt; and among segments of the modern non-Orthodox denominations. Modern branches of Judaism such as [[Humanistic Judaism]] may be [[nontheistic]].&lt;ref name="Society for Humanistic Judaism" /&gt; Today, the largest [[Jewish religious movements]] are [[Orthodox Judaism]] ([[Haredi Judaism]] and [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]]), [[Conservative Judaism]], and [[Reform Judaism]]. Major sources of difference between these groups are their approaches to [[Jewish law]], the authority of the [[Rabbinic tradition]], and the significance of the [[State of Israel]].&lt;ref name="Jewish Denominations" /&gt; Orthodox Judaism maintains that the Torah and Jewish law are divine in origin, eternal and unalterable, and that they should be strictly followed. Conservative and Reform Judaism are more [[Religious liberalism|liberal]], with Conservative Judaism generally promoting a more traditionalist interpretation of Judaism's requirements than Reform Judaism. A typical Reform position is that Jewish law should be viewed as a set of general guidelines rather than as a set of restrictions and obligations whose observance is required of all Jews.&lt;ref name="Reform Judaism" /&gt;&lt;ref name="What is Reform Judaism?" /&gt; Historically, [[beth din|special courts]] enforced Jewish law; today, these courts still exist but the practice of Judaism is mostly voluntary.&lt;ref name="Britannica Online Encyclopedia: Bet Din" /&gt; Authority on theological and legal matters is not vested in any one person or organization, but in the sacred texts and the [[rabbis]] and scholars who interpret them.&lt;ref name="religiousleadership" /&gt;

The [[history of Judaism]] spans more than 3,000 years.&lt;ref name="MINDELL2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=David P Mindell|title=The Evolving World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s8kA6eaz7hsC&amp;pg=PA224|date=30 June 2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-04108-0|page=224}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judaism has its roots as an [[organized religion]] in the [[Middle East]] during the [[Bronze Age]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/judaism/history/history_1.shtml|title=History of Judaism until 164 BCE|work=History of Judaism|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judaism is considered one of the oldest monotheistic religions.&lt;ref name="Religion &amp; Ethics – Judaism" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/globalconnections/mideast/themes/religion/ Religion: Three Religions, One God] PBS&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hebrews]] and [[Israelites]] were already referred to as "Jews" in later books of the Tanakh such as the [[Book of Esther]], with the term Jews replacing the title "Children of Israel".&lt;ref name="google" /&gt; Judaism's texts, traditions and values strongly influenced later [[Abrahamic religions]], including [[Christianity]], [[Islam]] and the [[Baha'i Faith]].&lt;ref name="Islam, Judaism, and Christianity: Theological and Historical Affiliations" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Historical Muhammad" /&gt; Many aspects of Judaism have also directly or indirectly influenced [[secular]] [[Western world|Western]] [[ethics]] and [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]].&lt;ref name="questia" /&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2017}} [[Hebraism]] was just as important a factor in the ancient era development of [[Western civilization]] as [[wikt:Hellenism|Hellenism]], and Judaism, as the background of [[Christianity]], has considerably shaped Western ideals and morality since [[Early Christianity]].&lt;ref name="Cambridge University Historical Series"&gt;Cambridge University Historical Series, ''An Essay on Western Civilization in Its Economic Aspects'', p.40: Hebraism, like Hellenism, has been an all-important factor in the development of Western Civilization; Judaism, as the precursor of Christianity, has indirectly had had much to do with shaping the ideals and morality of western nations since the christian era.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jews are an [[ethnoreligious group]]&lt;ref name="Ethnoreligious" /&gt; including those born Jewish, in addition to [[converts to Judaism]]. In 2015, the [[Jewish population by country|world Jewish population]] was estimated at about 14.3&amp;nbsp;million, or roughly 0.2% of the total world population.&lt;ref name=WJP2015&gt;{{cite web|title=World Jewish Population 2015|url=http://www.jewishdatabank.org/Studies/details.cfm?StudyID=803|accessdate=8 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 43% of all Jews reside in [[Israel]] and another 43% reside in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], with most of the remainder living in [[Europe]], and other minority groups spread throughout [[Latin America]], [[Asia]], [[Africa]], and [[Australia]].&lt;ref name="WJP2015" /&gt;

Unlike other ancient Near Eastern gods, the Hebrew God is portrayed as unitary and solitary; consequently, the Hebrew God's principal relationships are not with other gods, but with the world, and more specifically, with the people he created.&lt;ref name="understanding" /&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2017}} Judaism thus begins with ethical monotheism: the belief that God is one and is concerned with the actions of mankind.&lt;ref name="google1" /&gt; According to the [[Tanakh]] (Hebrew Bible), God promised [[Abraham]] to make of his offspring a great nation.&lt;ref name="everlasting" /&gt; Many generations later, he commanded the nation of [[Israelites|Israel]] to love and worship only one God; that is, the Jewish nation is to reciprocate God's concern for the world.&lt;ref name="deuteronomy" /&gt; He also commanded the Jewish people to love one another; that is, Jews are to imitate God's love for people.&lt;ref name="leviticus" /&gt; These commandments are but two of a large corpus of [[613 mitzvot|commandments]] and [[Halakha|laws]] that constitute this [[Covenant (biblical)|covenant]], which is the substance of Judaism.

Thus, although there is an esoteric tradition in Judaism ([[Kabbalah]]), Rabbinic scholar [[Max Kadushin]] has characterized normative Judaism as "normal mysticism", because it involves everyday personal experiences of God through ways or modes that are common to all Jews.&lt;ref name="publishing" /&gt; This is played out through the observance of the [[Halakha]] (Jewish law) and given verbal expression in the [[List of Jewish prayers and blessings|Birkat Ha-Mizvot]], the short blessings that are spoken every time a positive commandment is to be fulfilled.
:The ordinary, familiar, everyday things and occurrences we have, constitute occasions for the experience of God. Such things as one's daily sustenance, the very day itself, are felt as manifestations of God's loving-kindness, calling for the ''Berakhot''. ''Kedushah'', holiness, which is nothing else than the imitation of God, is concerned with daily conduct, with being gracious and merciful, with keeping oneself from defilement by idolatry, adultery, and the shedding of blood. The ''Birkat Ha-Mitzwot'' evokes the consciousness of holiness at a rabbinic rite, but the objects employed in the majority of these rites are non-holy and of general character, while the several holy objects are [[Theurgy|non-theurgic.]] And not only do ordinary things and occurrences bring with them the experience of God. Everything that happens to a man evokes that experience, evil as well as good, for a ''Berakah'' is said also at evil tidings. Hence, although the experience of God is like none other, the ''occasions'' for experiencing Him, for having a consciousness of Him, are manifold, even if we consider only those that call for Berakot.&lt;ref name="publishing2" /&gt;
Whereas [[Jewish philosophy|Jewish philosophers]] often debate whether God is [[Immanence|immanent]] or [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]], and whether people have free will or their lives are determined, [[Halakha]] is a system through which any Jew acts to bring God into the world.

Ethical monotheism is central in all sacred or normative texts of Judaism. However, monotheism has not always been followed in practice. The Jewish Bible ([[Tanakh]]) records and repeatedly condemns the widespread worship of other gods in [[ancient Israel]].&lt;ref name="mechon-mamre" /&gt; In the Greco-Roman era, many different interpretations of monotheism existed in Judaism, including the interpretations that gave rise to Christianity.&lt;ref name="The Jewish roots of Christological monotheism: papers from the St. Andrews conference on the historical origins of the worship of Jesus" /&gt;

Moreover, some have argued that Judaism is a non-creedal religion that does not require one to believe in God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283487502_Is_There_a_Jewish_Theology_or_Not|title=Is There a Jewish Theology or Not?|last=Maimes|first=Steven|date=Jan 2013|website=|language=en|via=ResearchGate|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=Nov 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/must-a-jew-believe-in-god/|title=Must a Jew Believe in God?|last=Septimus|first=Daniel|work=My Jewish Learning|access-date=Nov 19, 2018|publisher=70 / Faces Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; For some, observance of Jewish law is more important than belief in God ''per se''.&lt;ref name="jovanovich" /&gt; In modern times, some liberal Jewish movements do not accept the existence of a personified deity active in history.&lt;ref name="movements" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/community/st-tammany/index.ssf/2014/01/theology_on_tap_winter_2014_un.html|title=Theology on Tap Winter 2014 under way in Mandeville: Keeping the Faith|work=NOLA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The debate about whether one can speak of authentic or normative Judaism is not only a debate among religious Jews but also among historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Normative Judaism?

Scholars throughout [[Jewish history]] have proposed numerous formulations of Judaism's core tenets, all of which have met with criticism.&lt;ref name="montpelier" /&gt; The most popular formulation is [[Maimonides]]' [[13 principles of faith|thirteen principles of faith]], developed in the 12th century. According to Maimonides, any Jew who rejects even one of these principles would be considered an apostate and a heretic.&lt;ref name="mesora" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Maimonides, 13 Principles of Faith" /&gt; Jewish scholars have held points of view diverging in various ways from Maimonides' principles.&lt;ref name="learning" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The JPS guide to Jewish traditions" /&gt;

In Maimonides' time, his list of tenets was criticized by [[Hasdai Crescas]] and [[Joseph Albo]]. Albo and [[Abraham ben David|the Raavad]] argued that Maimonides' principles contained too many items that, while true, were not fundamentals of the faith.

Along these lines, the ancient historian [[Josephus]] emphasized practices and observances rather than religious beliefs, associating [[apostasy]] with a failure to observe Jewish law and maintaining that the requirements for conversion to Judaism included [[circumcision]] and adherence to traditional customs. Maimonides' principles were largely ignored over the next few centuries.&lt;ref name="medieval" /&gt; Later, two poetic restatements of these principles ("''[[Ani Ma'amin]]''" and "''[[Yigdal]]''") became integrated into many Jewish liturgies,&lt;ref name="The Thirteen Principles of the Jewish Faith" /&gt; leading to their eventual near-universal acceptance.&lt;ref name="What Do Jews Believe?" /&gt;&lt;ref name="traditions" /&gt;

In modern times, Judaism lacks a centralized authority that would dictate an exact religious dogma.&lt;ref name="religiousleadership" /&gt;&lt;ref name="judaism101beliefs" /&gt; Because of this, many different variations on the basic beliefs are considered within the scope of Judaism.&lt;ref name="learning" /&gt; Even so, all [[Jewish religious movements]] are, to a greater or lesser extent, based on the principles of the [[Hebrew Bible]] and various commentaries such as the [[Talmud]] and [[Midrash]]. Judaism also universally recognizes the Biblical [[Covenant (biblical)|Covenant]] between God and the [[Patriarchs (Bible)|Patriarch]] [[Abraham]] as well as the additional aspects of the Covenant revealed to [[Moses]], who is considered Judaism's greatest [[prophet]].&lt;ref name="learning" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ontario" /&gt;&lt;ref name="patriarchscovenant" /&gt;&lt;ref name="How Do You Know the Exodus Really Happened?" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sacredtexts" /&gt; In the [[Mishnah]], a core text of [[Rabbinic Judaism]], acceptance of the Divine origins of this covenant is considered an essential aspect of Judaism and those who reject the Covenant forfeit their share in the [[World to Come]].&lt;ref name="sacred-texts" /&gt;

Establishing the core tenets of Judaism in the modern era is even more difficult, given the number and diversity of the contemporary [[Jewish religious movements|Jewish denominations]]. Even if to restrict the problem to the most influential intellectual trends of the nineteenth and twentieth century, the matter remains complicated. Thus for instance, [[Joseph B. Soloveitchik|Joseph Soloveitchik's]] (associated with the [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox movement]]) answer to modernity is constituted upon the identification of Judaism with following the [[halakha]] whereas its ultimate goal is to bring the holiness down to the world. [[Mordecai Kaplan]], the founder of the [[Reconstructionist Judaism]], abandons the idea of religion for the sake of identifying Judaism with [[civilization]] and by means of the latter term and secular translation of the core ideas, he tries to embrace as many Jewish denominations as possible. In turn, [[Solomon Schechter]]'s [[Conservative Judaism]] was identical with the tradition understood as the interpretation of Torah, in itself being the history of the constant updates and adjustment of the Law performed by means of the creative interpretation. Finally, [[David Philipson]] draws the outlines of the [[Reform Judaism|Reform movement]] in Judaism by opposing it to the strict and traditional rabbinical approach and thus comes to the conclusions similar to that of the Conservative movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.academia.edu/15006583/Some_Remarks_on_the_Self-Images_of_the_Modern_Judaism._Textual_Analysis|title=Some Remarks on the Self-Images of the Modern Judaism.

===Jewish legal literature===
{{Main article|Halakha}}
The basis of Jewish law and tradition (halakha) is the [[Torah]] (also known as the [[Pentateuch]] or the Five Books of Moses). According to rabbinic tradition, there are [[613 mitzvot|613 commandments]] in the Torah. Some of these laws are directed only to men or to women, some only to the ancient priestly groups, the [[Kohen|Kohanim]] and [[Levite|Leviyim]] (members of the tribe of [[Levi]]), some only to farmers within the [[Land of Israel]]. Many laws were only applicable when the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] existed, and only 369 of these commandments are still applicable today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/541686/jewish/How-Many-of-the-Torahs-Commandments-Still-Apply.htm|title=How Many of the Torah's Commandments Still Apply?|last=Danzinger|first=Eliezer|website=Chabad.org|access-date=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While there have been Jewish groups whose beliefs were based on the written text of the Torah alone (e.g., the [[Sadducees]], and the [[Karaite Judaism|Karaites]]), most Jews believe in the [[Oral law#Oral law in Judaism|oral law]]. These oral traditions were transmitted by the [[Pharisees|Pharisee]] school of thought of ancient Judaism and were later recorded in written form and expanded upon by the rabbis.

According to Rabbinical Jewish tradition, God gave both the Written Law (the [[Torah]]) and the [[Oral law]] to Moses on [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]]. The Oral law is the oral tradition as relayed by God to Moses and from him, transmitted and taught to the sages ([[rabbi]]nic leaders) of each subsequent generation.

For centuries, the Torah appeared only as a written text transmitted in parallel with the oral tradition. Fearing that the oral teachings might be forgotten, Rabbi [[Judah haNasi]] undertook the mission of consolidating the various opinions into one body of law which became known as the ''Mishnah''.&lt;ref&gt;Codex Judaica Kantor 2006, page 146" (as cited on [[Judah haNasi]])&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mishnah consists of 63 tractates codifying Jewish law, which are the basis of the ''Talmud.'' According to [[Abraham ben David]], the ''[[Mishnah]]'' was compiled by Rabbi [[Judah the Prince|Judah haNasi]] after the destruction of Jerusalem, in [[anno mundi]] 3949, which corresponds to 189 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Abraham ben David, ''Seder Ha-Kabbalah Leharavad'', Jerusalem 1971, p.16 (Hebrew) (as cited on [[Judah haNasi]])&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next four centuries, the Mishnah underwent discussion and debate in both of the world's major Jewish communities (in Israel and [[History of the Jews in Iraq|Babylonia]]). The commentaries from each of these communities were eventually compiled into the two [[Talmud]]s, the Jerusalem Talmud (''Talmud Yerushalmi'') and the Babylonian Talmud (''Talmud Bavli''). These have been further expounded by commentaries of various Torah scholars during the ages.

In the text of the Torah, many words are left undefined and many procedures are mentioned without explanation or instructions. Such phenomena are sometimes offered to validate the viewpoint that the Written Law has always been transmitted with a parallel oral tradition, illustrating the assumption that the reader is already familiar with the details from other, i.e., oral, sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aishdas.org/student/oral.htm|title=Proofs for the Oral Law|last=Student|first=Gil|date=|website=The AishDas Society|access-date=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Halakha, the rabbinic Jewish way of life, then, is based on a combined reading of the Torah, and the oral tradition—the Mishnah, the halakhic [[Midrash]], the Talmud and its commentaries. The Halakha has developed slowly, through a precedent-based system. The literature of questions to rabbis, and their considered answers, is referred to as [[responsa]] (in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], ''Sheelot U-Teshuvot''.) Over time, as practices develop, codes of Jewish law are written that are based on the responsa; the most important code, the [[Shulchan Aruch]], largely determines Orthodox religious practice today.

===Jewish philosophy===
{{Main article|Jewish philosophy}}
Jewish philosophy refers to the conjunction between serious study of philosophy and Jewish theology. Major Jewish philosophers include [[Solomon ibn Gabirol]], [[Saadia Gaon]], [[Judah Halevi]], [[Maimonides]], and [[Gersonides]]. Major changes occurred in response to the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] (late 18th to early 19th century) leading to the post-Enlightenment Jewish philosophers. Modern Jewish philosophy consists of both Orthodox and non-Orthodox oriented philosophy. Notable among Orthodox Jewish philosophers are [[Eliyahu Eliezer Dessler]], [[Joseph B. Soloveitchik]], and [[Yitzchok Hutner]]. Well-known non-Orthodox Jewish philosophers include [[Martin Buber]], [[Franz Rosenzweig]], [[Mordecai Kaplan]], [[Abraham Joshua Heschel]], [[Will Herberg]], and [[Emmanuel Lévinas]].

===Rabbinic hermeneutics===
{{Quote box|width=35%|align=right|quote=13 Principles of Hermeneutics:

# A law that operates under certain conditions will surely be operative in other situations where the same conditions are present in a more acute form
# A law operating in one situation will also be operative in another situation if the text characterizes both situations in identical terms.
# A law that clearly expresses the purpose it was meant to serve will also apply to other situations where the identical purpose may be served.
# When a general rule is followed by illustrative particulars, only those particulars are to be embraced by it.
# A law that begins with specifying particular cases, and then proceeds to an all-embracing generalization, is to be applied to particulars cases not specified but logically falling into the same generalization.
# A law that begins with a generalization as to its intended applications, then continues with the specification of particular cases, and then concludes with a restatement of the generalization, can be applied only to the particular cases specified.
# The rules about a generalization being followed or preceded by specifying particulars (rules 4 and 5) will not apply if it is apparent that the specification of the particular cases or the statement of the generalization is meant purely for achieving a greater clarity of language.
# A particular case already covered in a generalization that is nevertheless treated separately suggests that the same particularized treatment be applied to all other cases which are covered in that generalization.
# A penalty specified for a general category of wrongdoing is not to be automatically applied to a particular case that is withdrawn from the general rule to be specifically prohibited, but without any mention of the penalty.
# A general prohibition followed by a specified penalty may be followed by a particular case, normally included in the generalization, with a modification in the penalty, either toward easing it or making it more severe.
# A case logically falling into a general law but treated separately remains outside the provisions of the general law except in those instances where it is specifically included in them.
# Obscurities in Biblical texts may be cleared up from the immediate context or from subsequently occurring passages
# Contradictions in Biblical passages may be removed through the mediation of other passages.

[[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] and many other [[Jews]] do not believe that the revealed [[Torah]] consists solely of its written contents, but of its interpretations as well. The study of [[Torah]] (in its widest sense, to include both poetry, narrative, and law, and both the [[Tanakh|Hebrew Bible]] and the [[Talmud]]) is in Judaism itself a sacred act of central importance. For the sages of the [[Mishnah]] and [[Talmud]], and for their successors today, the study of Torah was therefore not merely a means to learn the contents of God's revelation, but an end in itself. According to the [[Talmud]],
:These are the things for which a person enjoys the dividends in this world while the principal remains for the person to enjoy in the world to come; they are: honoring parents, loving deeds of kindness, and making peace between one person and another. But the study of the Torah is equal to them all. (Talmud Shabbat 127a).
In Judaism, "the study of [[Torah]] can be a means of experiencing God".&lt;ref name="publishing3" /&gt; Reflecting on the contribution of the [[Amoraim]] and [[Tanaim]] to contemporary Judaism, Professor Jacob Neusner observed:
:The rabbi's logical and rational inquiry is not mere logic-chopping. It is a most serious and substantive effort to locate in trivialities the fundamental principles of the revealed will of God to guide and sanctify the most specific and concrete actions in the workaday world .... Here is the mystery of Talmudic Judaism: the alien and remote conviction that the intellect is an instrument not of unbelief and desacralization but of sanctification."&lt;ref name="invitation" /&gt;
To study the Written Torah and the Oral Torah in light of each other is thus also to study ''how'' to study the word of God.

In the study of Torah, the sages formulated and followed various [[logic]]al and [[hermeneutics|hermeneutical]] principles. According to David Stern, all Rabbinic hermeneutics rest on two basic axioms:
:first, the belief in the omni-significance of Scripture, in the meaningfulness of its every word, letter, even (according to one famous report) scribal flourish; second, the claim of the essential unity of Scripture as the expression of the single divine will.&lt;ref name="indeterminacy" /&gt;
These two principles make possible a great variety of interpretations. According to the Talmud,
:A single verse has several meanings, but no two verses hold the same meaning. It was taught in the school of R. Ishmael: 'Behold, My word is like fire—declares the Lord—and like a hammer that shatters rock' (Jer 23:29). Just as this hammer produces many sparks (when it strikes the rock), so a single verse has several meanings." (Talmud Sanhedrin 34a).
Observant Jews thus view the Torah as dynamic, because it contains within it a host of interpretations&lt;ref name="indeterminacy4" /&gt;

According to Rabbinic tradition, all valid interpretations of the [[written Torah]] were revealed to Moses at Sinai in [[oral Torah|oral form]], and handed down from teacher to pupil (The oral revelation is in effect coextensive with the Talmud itself). When different rabbis forwarded conflicting interpretations, they sometimes appealed to hermeneutic principles to legitimize their arguments; some rabbis claim that these principles were themselves revealed by God to Moses at Sinai.&lt;ref name="indeterminacy5" /&gt;

Thus, [[Hillel the Elder|Hillel]] called attention to seven commonly used hermeneutical principles in the interpretation of laws ([[baraita]] at the beginning of [[Sifra]]); [[R. Ishmael]], thirteen (baraita at the beginning of Sifra; this collection is largely an amplification of that of Hillel).&lt;ref name="introduction" /&gt; [[Eliezer b. Jose ha-Gelili]] listed 32, largely used for the exegesis of narrative elements of Torah. All the hermeneutic rules scattered through the [[Talmudim]] and [[Midrashim]] have been collected by [[Malbim]] in ''Ayyelet ha-Shachar'', the introduction to his commentary on the [[Sifra]]. Nevertheless, R. Ishmael's 13 principles are perhaps the ones most widely known; they constitute an important, and one of Judaism's earliest, contributions to [[logic]], [[hermeneutics]], and [[jurisprudence]].&lt;ref name="introduction6" /&gt; [[Judah Hadassi]] incorporated Ishmael's principles into [[Karaite Judaism]] in the 12th century.&lt;ref name="introduction7" /&gt; Today R. Ishmael's 13 principles are incorporated into the Jewish prayer book to be read by observant Jews on a daily basis.&lt;ref name="jerusalem" /&gt;&lt;ref name="congregations" /&gt;&lt;ref name="publications" /&gt;&lt;ref name="publication" /&gt;

==Jewish identity==
===Origin of the term "Judaism"===
[[File:Macedonian Mezuzah.jpg|right|thumb|A [[mezuzah]] case]]

The term "Judaism" derives from ''Iudaismus'', a Latinized form of the Ancient Greek ''[[Ioudaismos]]'' (Ἰουδαϊσμός) (from the verb {{lang|grc|ἰουδαΐζειν}}, "to side with or imitate the [Judeans]").&lt;ref name="LSJverb"&gt;{{LSJ|*)ioudai/zw|ἰουδαΐζειν|ref|mLSJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its ultimate source was the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] יהודה, ''Yehudah'', "[[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]]",&lt;ref name="bibleinterp_mason3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="askoxford8" /&gt; which is also the source of the Hebrew term for Judaism: יַהֲדוּת, ''Yahadut''. The term ''Ἰουδαϊσμός'' first appears in the [[Hellenistic Greek]] book of [[2 Maccabees]] in the 2nd century BCE. In the context of the age and period it meant "seeking or forming part of a cultural entity"&lt;ref name=influence /&gt; and it resembled its antonym ''[[hellenismos]]'', a word that signified a people's submission to [[Hellenistic period|Hellenic]] ([[Ancient Greece|Greek]]) cultural norms. The conflict between ''iudaismos'' and ''hellenismos'' lay behind the [[Maccabean revolt]] and hence the invention of the term ''iudaismos''.&lt;ref name=influence&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2q6qTb-A7GwC&amp;pg=RA1-PA39 |first=Oskar |last=Skarsaune |authorlink=Oskar Skarsaune | title=In the Shadow of the Temple: Jewish Influences on Early Christianity|publisher=InterVarsity Press|pages=39ff. |accessdate=22 August 2010|isbn=978-0-8308-2670-4|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shaye J. D. Cohen]] writes in his book ''The Beginnings of Jewishness'':

{{quote|We are tempted, of course, to translate [''Ioudaïsmós''] as "Judaism," but this translation is too narrow, because in this first occurrence of the term, ''Ioudaïsmós'' has not yet been reduced to the designation of a religion. It means rather "the aggregate of all those characteristics that makes Judaeans Judaean (or Jews Jewish)." Among these characteristics, to be sure, are practices and beliefs that we would today call "religious," but these practices and beliefs are not the sole content of the term. Thus ''Ioudaïsmós'' should be translated not as "Judaism" but as Judaeanness.&lt;ref&gt;Shaye J.D. Cohen 1999 ''The Beginnings of Jewishness: Boundaries, Varieties, Uncertainties'' University of California Press. 105–106&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' the earliest citation in English where the term was used to mean "the profession or practice of the Jewish religion; the religious system or polity of the Jews" is Robert Fabyan's ''The newe cronycles of Englande and of Fraunce'' (1516).&lt;ref&gt;"He anon renouncyd his Iudaisme or Moysen Lawe, And was cristenyd, and lyued after as a Cristen Man." (Robert Fabian, ''New Chronicles of England and France'', reprint London 1811, p. 334.)&lt;/ref&gt; "Judaism" as a direct translation of the Latin ''Iudaismus'' first occurred in a 1611 English translation of the [[Biblical apocrypha|apocrypha]] ([[Deuterocanon]] in [[Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]]), 2 Macc. ii. 21: "Those that behaved themselves manfully to their honour for Iudaisme."&lt;ref name="dictionary" /&gt;

===Distinction between Jews as a people and Judaism===
According to [[Daniel Boyarin]], the underlying distinction between religion and ethnicity is foreign to Judaism itself, and is one form of the dualism between spirit and flesh that has its origin in [[Plato]]nic philosophy and that permeated [[Hellenistic Judaism]].&lt;ref name="A radical Jew: Paul and the politics of identity" /&gt; Consequently, in his view, Judaism does not fit easily into conventional Western categories, such as religion, ethnicity, or culture. Boyarin suggests that this in part reflects the fact that much of Judaism's more than 3,000-year history predates the rise of Western culture and occurred outside the West (that is, Europe, particularly medieval and modern Europe). During this time, Jews experienced slavery, anarchic and theocratic self-government, conquest, occupation, and exile. In the Diaspora, they were in contact with, and influenced by, ancient Egyptian, Babylonian, Persian, and Hellenic cultures, as well as modern movements such as the Enlightenment (see [[Haskalah]]) and the rise of nationalism, which would bear fruit in the form of a Jewish state in their ancient homeland, the [[Land of Israel]]. They also saw an elite population convert to Judaism (the [[Khazar]]s), only to disappear as the centers of power in the lands once occupied by that elite fell to the people of Rus and then the Mongols.{{citation needed | reason= Boyarin does not say anything about Khazars is this synthesis?|date=April 2015}} Thus, Boyarin has argued that "Jewishness disrupts the very categories of identity, because it is not national, not genealogical, not religious, but all of these, in dialectical tension."&lt;ref name="A radical Jew: Paul and the politics of identity10" /&gt;

In contrast to this point of view, practices such as [[Humanistic Judaism]] reject the religious aspects of Judaism, while retaining certain cultural traditions.

===Who is a Jew?===
{{Main article|Who is a Jew?}}

According to [[Rabbinic Judaism]], a Jew is anyone who was either born of a Jewish mother or who [[Conversion to Judaism|converted to Judaism]] in accordance with Jewish Law. [[Reconstructionist Judaism]] and the larger denominations of worldwide [[Reform Judaism|Progressive Judaism]] (also known as Liberal or Reform Judaism) accept the child as Jewish if one of the parents is Jewish, if the parents raise the child with a Jewish identity, but not the smaller regional branches.{{Clarify|date=December 2015}} All mainstream forms of Judaism today are open to sincere converts, although conversion has traditionally been discouraged since the time of the Talmud. The conversion process is evaluated by an authority, and the convert is examined on his or her sincerity and knowledge.&lt;ref name="Who is a Jew?" /&gt; Converts are called "ben Abraham" or "bat Abraham", (son or daughter of Abraham). Conversions have on occasion been overturned. In 2008, Israel's highest religious court invalidated the conversion of 40,000 Jews, mostly from Russian immigrant families, even though they had been approved by an Orthodox rabbi.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel G. Freedman, [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/07/us/strains-grow-between-israel-and-many-jews-in-the-us.html "Strains Grow Between Israel and Many Jews in the U.S."] ''[[The New York Times]]'', 6 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbinical Judaism maintains that a Jew, whether by birth or conversion, is a Jew forever. Thus a Jew who claims to be an atheist or converts to another religion is still considered by traditional Judaism to be Jewish. According to some sources, the Reform movement has maintained that a Jew who has converted to another religion is no longer a Jew,&lt;ref name="faqs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="university" /&gt; and the Israeli Government has also taken that stance after Supreme Court cases and statutes.&lt;ref name="Law of Return 5710-1950" /&gt; However, the Reform movement has indicated that this is not so cut and dried, and different situations call for consideration and differing actions. For example, Jews who have converted under duress may be permitted to return to Judaism "without any action on their part but their desire to rejoin the Jewish community" and "A proselyte who has become an apostate remains, nevertheless, a Jew".&lt;ref name="Jacob, Walter (1987). Contemporary American Reform Responsa. Mars, PA: Publishers Choice Book Mfg." /&gt;

[[Karaite Judaism]] believes that Jewish identity can only be transmitted by patrilineal descent. Although a minority of modern Karaites believe that Jewish identity requires that both parents be Jewish, and not only the father. They argue that only patrilineal descent can transmit Jewish identity on the grounds that all descent in the Torah went according to the male line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.karaite-korner.org/karaite_faq.shtml|title=Karaite FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions About Karaism|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The question of what determines Jewish identity in the State of Israel was given new impetus when, in the 1950s, [[David Ben-Gurion]] requested opinions on ''mihu Yehudi'' ("Who is a Jew") from Jewish religious authorities and intellectuals worldwide in order to settle citizenship questions. This is still not settled, and occasionally resurfaces in [[Politics of Israel|Israeli politics]].

Historical definitions of [[Jewish identity]] have traditionally been based on ''[[halakha|halakhic]]'' definitions of matrilineal descent, and halakhic conversions. Historical definitions of who is a Jew date back to the codification of the [[Oral Torah]] into the [[Talmud|Babylonian Talmud]], around 200 [[Common Era|CE]]. Interpretations of sections of the Tanakh, such as [[Book of Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]] 7:1–5, by Jewish sages, are used as a warning against [[Interfaith marriage in Judaism|intermarriage]] between Jews and [[Canaanites]] because "[the non-Jewish husband] will cause your child to turn away from Me and they will worship the gods (i.e., idols) of others." {{bibleref2|Leviticus|24:10}} says that the son in a marriage between a Hebrew woman and an [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] man is "of the community of Israel." This is complemented by {{bibleref2|Ezra|10:2–3}}, where Israelites returning from Babylon vow to put aside their [[gentile]] wives and their children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shamash.org/lists/scj-faq/HTML/faq/10-11.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19961018024300/http://shamash.org/lists/scj-faq/HTML/faq/10-11.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=18 October 1996|title=What is the origin of Matrilineal Descent?|accessdate=9 January 2009|date=4 September 2003|publisher=Shamash.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torah.org/qanda/seequanda.php?id=318 |title=What is the source of the law that a child is Jewish only if its mother is Jewish? |accessdate=9 January 2009 |publisher=Torah.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224205847/http://www.torah.org/qanda/seequanda.php?id=318 |archivedate=24 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A popular theory is that the rape of Jewish women in captivity brought about the law of Jewish identity being inherited through the maternal line, although scholars challenge this theory citing the Talmudic establishment of the law from the pre-exile period.&lt;ref name="Klein2016"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0BC_DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA6|title=Lost Jews: The Struggle for Identity Today|author=Emma Klein|date=27 July 2016|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-349-24319-8|pages=6–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schott2010"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6iFx-wHhMJMC&amp;pg=PA67|title=Birth, Death, and Femininity: Philosophies of Embodiment|author=Robin May Schott|date=25 October 2010|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=0-253-00482-9|pages=67–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the anti-religious ''[[Haskalah]]'' movement of the late 18th and 19th centuries, ''halakhic'' interpretations of Jewish identity have been challenged.&lt;ref&gt;Dosick (2007), pp. 56–57.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jewish demographics===
{{Main|Jewish population by country}}

The total number of Jews worldwide is difficult to assess because the definition of "who is a Jew" is problematic; not all Jews identify themselves as Jewish, and some who identify as Jewish are not considered so by other Jews. According to the ''Jewish Year Book'' (1901), the global Jewish population in 1900 was around 11 million. The latest available data is from the World Jewish Population Survey of 2002 and the Jewish Year Calendar (2005). In 2002, according to the Jewish Population Survey, there were 13.3&amp;nbsp;million Jews around the world. The Jewish Year Calendar cites 14.6&amp;nbsp;million. Jewish population growth is currently near zero percent, with 0.3% growth from 2000 to 2001.

==Jewish religious movements==
{{Main article|Jewish religious movements}}

===Rabbinic Judaism===
Rabbinic Judaism (or in some Christian traditions, Rabbinism) (Hebrew: "Yahadut Rabanit" – יהדות רבנית) has been the mainstream form of Judaism since the 6th century CE, after the codification of the [[Talmud]]. It is characterised by the belief that the [[Written Torah]] (Written Law) cannot be correctly interpreted without reference to the [[Oral Torah]] and the voluminous literature specifying what behavior is sanctioned by the [[halakha|Law]].

The [[Jewish Enlightenment]] of the late 18th century resulted in the division of [[Ashkenazi]] (Western) Jewry into religious movements or denominations, especially in North America and Anglophone countries. The main denominations today outside Israel (where the situation is rather different) are Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform.
* [[Orthodox Judaism]] holds that both the Written and [[Oral Torah]] were divinely revealed to [[Moses]] and that the laws within it are binding and unchanging. Orthodox Jews generally consider commentaries on the ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]'' (a condensed codification of halakha that largely favored Sephardic traditions) to be the definitive codification of Jewish law. Orthodoxy places a high importance on [[13 Principles of Faith|Maimonides' 13 principles]] as a definition of Jewish faith.
:* Orthodoxy is often divided into [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]] and [[Haredi Judaism]]. [[Haredi Judaism]] is less accommodating to modernity and has less interest in non-Jewish disciplines, and it may be distinguished from [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]] in practice by its styles of dress and more stringent practices. Subsets of [[Haredi Judaism]] include [[Hasidic Judaism]], which is rooted in the [[Kabbalah]] and distinguished by reliance on a [[Rebbe]] or religious teacher; and [[Sephardic Haredi]] Judaism, which emerged among [[Sephardic]] (Asian and North African) Jews in Israel.
* [[Conservative Judaism]] is characterized by a commitment to traditional Jewish laws and customs, including observance of [[Shabbat]] and [[kashrut]], a deliberately non-fundamentalist teaching of Jewish principles of faith, a positive attitude toward modern culture, and an acceptance of both traditional rabbinic and modern scholarship when considering Jewish religious texts. Conservative Judaism teaches that Jewish law is not static, but has always developed in response to changing conditions. It holds that the Torah is a divine document written by prophets inspired by God and reflecting his will, but rejects the Orthodox position that it was dictated by God to Moses.&lt;ref name="Torah MiSinai:Conservative Views" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Conservative Judaism" /&gt; Conservative Judaism holds that the [[oral Torah|Oral Law]] is divine and normative, but holds that both the Written and Oral Law may be interpreted by the rabbis to reflect modern sensibilities and suit modern conditions.
* [[Reform Judaism]], called Liberal or Progressive Judaism in many countries, defines Judaism in relatively universalist terms, rejects most of the ritual and ceremonial laws of the [[Torah]] while observing moral laws, and emphasizes the ethical call of the [[Nevi'im|Prophets]]. Reform Judaism has developed an egalitarian prayer service in the vernacular (along with [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] in many cases) and emphasizes personal connection to Jewish tradition.
[[File:ReformJewishService.jpg|upright=1.05|thumb|right|A [[Reform Judaism|Reform synagogue]] with mixed seating and equal participation of men and women]]

* [[Reconstructionist Judaism]], like Reform Judaism, does not hold that Jewish law, as such, requires observance, but unlike Reform, Reconstructionist thought emphasizes the role of the community in deciding what observances to follow.
* [[Jewish Renewal]] is a recent North American movement which focuses on spirituality and social justice but does not address issues of Jewish law. Men and women participate equally in prayer.
* [[Humanistic Judaism]] is a small non-theistic movement centered in North America and Israel that emphasizes Jewish culture and history as the sources of Jewish identity.

====Sephardi and Mizrahi Judaism====
While [[Minhag|traditions and customs]] (see also "[[Sephardic law and customs]]") vary between discrete communities, it can be said that [[Sephardi]] and [[Mizrahi]] Jewish communities do not generally adhere to the "movement" framework popular in and among [[Ashkenazi]] Jewry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Elazar|first1=Daniel|title=Can Sephardic Judaism be Reconstructed?|url=http://www.jcpa.org/dje/articles3/sephardic.htm|website=Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs|accessdate=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, Sephardi and Mizrahi communities have eschewed denominations in favour of a "big tent" approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jager|first1=Elliot|title=Sephardi Judaism Straining to Stay Non-Denominational|url=https://www.jpost.com/Jerusalem-Report/Sephardi-Judaism-Straining-to-Stay-Non-Denominational-513181|website=Jerusalem Post|accessdate=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is particularly the case in contemporary [[State of israel|Israel]], which is home to the largest communities of Sephardi and Mizrahi Jews in the world. (However, individual Sephardi and Mizrahi Jews may be members of or attend synagogues that do adhere to one Ashkenazi-inflected movement or another.) 

Sephardi and Mizrahi observance of Judaism tends toward the conservative, and [[Nusach#Sephardi_and_Mizrachi_nuschaot|prayer rites]] are reflective of this, with the text of each rite being largely unchanged since their respective inception. Observant Sephardim may follow the teachings of a particular rabbi or school of thought; for example, the Sephardic [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel|Chief Rabbi of Israel]].

====Jewish movements in Israel====
{{Main article|Religion in Israel}}
Most Jewish Israelis classify themselves as "secular" (''hiloni''), [[Masortim|"traditional" (''masorti'')]], "religious" (''dati'') or ''[[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]]''. The term "secular" is more popular as a self-description among Israeli families of western (European) origin, whose Jewish identity may be a very powerful force in their lives, but who see it as largely independent of traditional religious belief and practice. This portion of the population largely ignores organized religious life, be it of the official Israeli rabbinate (Orthodox) or of the liberal movements common to diaspora Judaism (Reform, Conservative).

The term "traditional" (''masorti'') is most common as a self-description among Israeli families of "eastern" origin (i.e., the Middle East, Central Asia, and North Africa). This term, as commonly used, has nothing to do with the [[Conservative Judaism]], which also names itself "Masorti" outside North America. There is a great deal of ambiguity in the ways "secular" and "traditional" are used in Israel: they often overlap, and they cover an extremely wide range in terms of worldview and practical religious observance. The term "Orthodox" is not popular in Israeli discourse, although the percentage of Jews who come under that category is far greater than in the [[Jewish Diaspora|diaspora]]. What would be called "Orthodox" in the diaspora includes what is commonly called ''dati'' (religious) or ''haredi'' (ultra-Orthodox) in Israel. The former term includes what is called "[[Religious Zionism]]" or the "National Religious" community, as well as what has become known over the past decade or so as ''haredi-leumi'' ([[nationalism|nationalist]] ''haredi''), or "Hardal", which combines a largely ''haredi'' lifestyle with nationalist ideology. (Some people, in [[Yiddish]], also refer to observant Orthodox Jews as ''frum'', as opposed to ''frei'' (more liberal Jews)).

''Haredi'' applies to a populace that can be roughly divided into three separate groups along both ethnic and ideological lines: (1) "Lithuanian" (non-hasidic) ''haredim'' of [[Ashkenazim|Ashkenazic]] origin; (2) Hasidic ''haredim'' of Ashkenazic origin; and (3) [[Sephardim|Sephardic]] ''haredim''.

===Karaites and Samaritans===
[[Karaite Judaism]] defines itself as the remnants of the non-Rabbinic Jewish sects of the [[Second Temple]] period, such as the [[Sadducees]]. The Karaites ("Scripturalists") accept only the Hebrew Bible and what they view as the [[Peshat]] ("simple" meaning); they do not accept non-biblical writings as authoritative. Some European Karaites do not see themselves as part of the Jewish community at all, although most do.

The [[Samaritan]]s, a very small community located entirely around [[Mount Gerizim]] in the [[Nablus]]/[[Shechem]] region of the [[West Bank]] and in [[Holon]], near [[Tel Aviv]] in Israel, regard themselves as the descendants of the Israelites of the Iron Age [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|kingdom of Israel]]. Their religious practices are based on the literal text of the written [[Torah]] (Five Books of Moses), which they view as the only authoritative scripture (with a special regard also for the [[Book of Joshua (Samaritan)|Samaritan Book of Joshua]]).

===Haymanot (Ethiopian Judaism)===
''See also: [[Haymanot]]; [[Beta Israel]].''

Haymanot (meaning "religion" in Ge'ez and Amharic) refers the Judaism practiced by Ethiopian Jews. This version of Judaism differs substantially from Rabbinic, Karaite, and Samaritan Judaisms, Ethiopian Jews having diverged from their coreligionists earlier. Sacred scriptures (the Orit) are written in Ge'ez, not Hebrew, and dietary laws are based strictly on the text of the Orit, without explication from ancillary commentaries. Holidays also differ, with some Rabbinic holidays not observed in Ethiopian Jewish communities, and some additional holidays, like [[Sigd]].

==Jewish observances==
===Jewish ethics===
{{Main article|Jewish ethics}}
Jewish ethics may be guided by [[halakhic]] traditions, by other moral principles, or by central Jewish virtues. Jewish ethical practice is typically understood to be marked by values such as justice, truth, peace, loving-kindness ([[chesed]]), compassion, humility, and self-respect. Specific Jewish ethical practices include practices of charity ([[tzedakah]]) and refraining from negative speech ([[lashon hara]]). Proper ethical practices regarding sexuality and many other issues are subjects of dispute among Jews.

===Prayers===
{{Main article|Jewish services}}
[[File:YemeniJew1914.jpg|thumbnail|upright=0.9|right|A Yemenite Jew at morning prayers, wearing a [[kippah]] skullcap, prayer shawl and [[tefillin]]]]
Traditionally, Jews recite prayers three times daily, [[Shacharit]], [[Mincha]], and [[Ma'ariv]] with a fourth prayer, [[Mussaf]] added on [[Shabbat]] and [[Jewish holiday|holidays]]. At the heart of each service is the ''[[Amidah]]'' or ''Shemoneh Esrei''. Another key prayer in many services is the declaration of faith, the ''[[Shema Yisrael]]'' (or ''Shema''). The ''Shema'' is the recitation of a verse from the Torah ([[Deuteronomy]] 6:4): ''Shema Yisrael Adonai Eloheinu Adonai Echad''—"Hear, O Israel! The Lord is our God! The Lord is One!"

Most of the prayers in a traditional Jewish service can be recited in solitary prayer, although communal prayer is preferred. Communal prayer requires a [[quorum]] of ten adult Jews, called a ''[[minyan]]''. In nearly all Orthodox and a few Conservative circles, only male Jews are counted toward a ''minyan''; most Conservative Jews and members of other Jewish denominations count female Jews as well.

In addition to prayer services, observant traditional Jews recite [[List of Jewish prayers and blessings|prayers and benedictions]] throughout the day when [[List of Jewish prayers and blessings#Everyday prayers and blessings|performing various acts]]. Prayers are recited upon [[Modeh ani|waking up in the morning]], before eating or drinking different foods, [[Birkat Hamazon|after eating a meal]], and so on.

The approach to prayer varies among the Jewish denominations. Differences can include the texts of prayers, the frequency of prayer, the number of prayers recited at various religious events, the use of musical instruments and choral music, and whether prayers are recited in the traditional liturgical languages or the vernacular. In general, Orthodox and Conservative congregations adhere most closely to tradition, and Reform and Reconstructionist synagogues are more likely to incorporate translations and contemporary writings in their services. Also, in most Conservative synagogues, and all Reform and Reconstructionist congregations, women participate in prayer services on an [[Egalitarianism|equal basis]] with men, including roles traditionally filled only by men, such as [[Torah reading|reading from the Torah]]. In addition, many Reform temples use musical accompaniment such as organs and mixed choirs.

===Religious clothing===
{{Further|kippah|tzitzit|tefillin}}
A ''[[kippah]]'' (Hebrew: כִּפָּה, plural ''kippot''; Yiddish: יאַרמלקע, ''yarmulke'') is a slightly rounded brimless skullcap worn by many Jews while praying, eating, reciting blessings, or studying Jewish religious texts, and at all times by some Jewish men. In Orthodox communities, only men wear kippot; in non-Orthodox communities, some women also wear kippot. ''Kippot'' range in size from a small round beanie that covers only the back of the head to a large, snug cap that covers the whole crown.

''[[Tzitzit]]'' (Hebrew: צִיציִת) ([[Ashkenazi Hebrew|Ashkenazi pronunciation]]: ''tzitzis'') are special knotted "fringes" or "tassels" found on the four corners of the ''[[tallit]]'' (Hebrew: טַלִּית) (Ashkenazi pronunciation: ''tallis''), or prayer [[shawl]]. The ''tallit'' is worn by Jewish men and some Jewish women during the prayer service. Customs vary regarding when a Jew begins wearing a tallit. In the Sephardi community, boys wear a tallit from bar mitzvah age. In some Ashkenazi communities, it is customary to wear one only after marriage. A ''tallit katan'' (small tallit) is a fringed garment worn under the clothing throughout the day. In some Orthodox circles, the fringes are allowed to hang freely outside the clothing.

[[Tefillin]] (Hebrew: תְפִלִּין), known in English as phylacteries (from the Greek word φυλακτήριον, meaning ''safeguard'' or ''amulet''), are two square leather boxes containing biblical verses, attached to the forehead and wound around the left arm by leather straps. They are worn during weekday morning prayer by observant Jewish men and some Jewish women.&lt;ref name="publishers" /&gt;

A ''[[kittel]]'' (Yiddish: קיטל), a white knee-length overgarment, is worn by prayer leaders and some observant traditional Jews on the [[High Holidays]]. It is traditional for the head of the household to wear a kittel at the Passover seder in some communities, and some grooms wear one under the wedding canopy. Jewish males are buried in a ''tallit'' and sometimes also a ''kittel'' which are part of the ''[[tachrichim]]'' (burial garments).

===Jewish holidays===
{{Main article|Jewish holiday}}
Jewish holidays are special days in the Jewish calendar, which celebrate moments in Jewish history, as well as central themes in the relationship between God and the world, such as [[Creation myth|creation]], [[revelation]], and [[salvation|redemption]].

====Shabbat====
{{Main article|Shabbat}}

[[File:Shabbat Challos.jpg|upright=1.15|right|thumb|Two braided Shabbat [[challah]]s placed under an embroidered [[challah cover]] at the start of the Shabbat meal]]
''[[Shabbat]]'', the weekly day of rest lasting from shortly before sundown on Friday night to nightfall on Saturday night, commemorates God's day of rest after six days of creation.&lt;ref name="shabbat" /&gt; It plays a pivotal role in Jewish practice and is governed by a large corpus of religious law. At sundown on Friday, the woman of the house welcomes the Shabbat by lighting two or more candles and reciting a blessing. The evening meal begins with the Kiddush, a blessing recited aloud over a cup of wine, and the Mohtzi, a blessing recited over the bread. It is customary to have [[challah]], two braided loaves of bread, on the table. During Shabbat, Jews are forbidden to engage in any activity that falls under [[39 categories of activity prohibited on Shabbat|39 categories of ''melakhah'']], translated literally as "work". In fact the activities banned on the Sabbath are not "work" in the usual sense: They include such actions as lighting a fire, writing, using money and carrying in the public domain. The prohibition of lighting a fire has been extended in the modern era to driving a car, which involves burning fuel and using electricity.

====Three pilgrimage festivals====
{{Main article|Shalosh regalim}}

[[File:Jerusalemsukkas.jpg|upright=1.15|right|thumb|Some [[sukkah|sukkot]] in Jerusalem]]
Jewish holy days (''chaggim''), celebrate landmark events in Jewish history, such as the Exodus from Egypt and the giving of the Torah, and sometimes mark the change of seasons and transitions in the agricultural cycle. The three major festivals, Sukkot, Passover and Shavuot, are called "regalim" (derived from the Hebrew word "regel", or foot). On the three regalim, it was customary for the Israelites to make pilgrimages to Jerusalem to offer sacrifices in the Temple.
* [[Passover]] (''Pesach'') is a week-long holiday beginning on the evening of the 14th day of [[Nisan]] (the first month in the Hebrew calendar), that commemorates the [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] from Egypt. Outside Israel, Passover is celebrated for eight days. In ancient times, it coincided with the barley harvest. It is the only holiday that centers on home-service, the [[Passover Seder|Seder]]. [[leavening agent|Leavened]] products ([[chametz]]) are removed from the house prior to the holiday and are not consumed throughout the week. Homes are thoroughly cleaned to ensure no bread or bread by-products remain, and a symbolic burning of the last vestiges of chametz is conducted on the morning of the Seder. [[Matzo]] is eaten instead of bread.
* [[Shavuot]] ("Pentecost" or "Feast of Weeks") celebrates the revelation of the [[Torah]] to the [[Israelite]]s on Mount Sinai. Also known as the Festival of Bikurim, or first fruits, it coincided in biblical times with the wheat harvest. Shavuot customs include all-night study marathons known as Tikkun Leil Shavuot, eating dairy foods (cheesecake and blintzes are special favorites), reading the Book of Ruth, decorating homes and synagogues with greenery, and wearing white clothing, symbolizing purity.
* [[Sukkot]] ("Tabernacles" or "The Festival of Booths") commemorates the Israelites' forty years of wandering through the desert on their way to the Promised Land. It is celebrated through the construction of temporary booths called ''sukkot'' (sing. ''[[sukkah]]'') that represent the temporary shelters of the Israelites during their wandering. It coincides with the fruit harvest and marks the end of the agricultural cycle. Jews around the world eat in ''sukkot'' for seven days and nights. Sukkot concludes with [[Shemini Atzeret]], where Jews begin to pray for rain and [[Simchat Torah]], "Rejoicing of the Torah", a holiday which marks reaching the end of the Torah reading cycle and beginning all over again. The occasion is celebrated with singing and dancing with the Torah scrolls. Shemini Atzeret and Simchat Torah are technically considered to be a separate holiday and not a part of Sukkot.

====High Holy Days====
[[File:Maurycy Gottlieb - Jews Praying in the Synagogue on Yom Kippur.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|''[[Yom Kippur]]'' by [[Maurycy Gottlieb]] (1878)]]
{{Main article|High Holidays}}
The High Holidays (''Yamim Noraim'' or "Days of Awe") revolve around judgment and forgiveness.
* [[Rosh Hashanah]], (also ''Yom Ha-Zikkaron'' or "Day of Remembrance", and ''Yom Teruah'', or "Day of the Sounding of the [[Shofar]]"). Rosh Hashanah is the Jewish New Year (literally, "head of the year"), although it falls on the first day of the seventh month of the [[Hebrew calendar]], [[Tishri]]. Rosh Hashanah marks the beginning of the 10-day period of atonement leading up to Yom Kippur, during which Jews are commanded to search their souls and make amends for sins committed, intentionally or not, throughout the year. Holiday customs include blowing the shofar, or ram's horn, in the synagogue, eating apples and honey, and saying blessings over a variety of symbolic foods, such as pomegranates.
* [[Yom Kippur]], ("Day of Atonement") is the holiest day of the Jewish year. It is a day of communal fasting and praying for forgiveness for one's sins. Observant Jews spend the entire day in the synagogue, sometimes with a short break in the afternoon, reciting prayers from a special holiday prayerbook called a "Machzor". Many non-religious Jews make a point of attending synagogue services and fasting on Yom Kippur. On the eve of Yom Kippur, before candles are lit, a prefast meal, the "seuda mafseket", is eaten. Synagogue services on the eve of Yom Kippur begin with the Kol Nidre prayer. It is customary to wear white on Yom Kippur, especially for Kol Nidre, and leather shoes are not worn. The following day, prayers are held from morning to evening. The final prayer service, called "Ne'ilah", ends with a long blast of the shofar.

====Purim====
{{Main article|Purim}}
[[File:Jerusalem Purim street scene.jpg|right|thumb|Purim street scene in Jerusalem]]
[[File:Présentation de la Loi, Edouard Moyse (1860) - Musée d'art et d'histoire du Judaïsme.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Torah]] reading, France, 1860 [[Musée d'Art et d'Histoire du Judaïsme|Museum of Jewish Art and History]]]]
[[Purim]] ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: {{Audio|He-Purim.ogg|פורים}} ''Pûrîm'' "[[Cleromancy|lots]]") is a joyous Jewish holiday that commemorates the deliverance of the [[Persian Jews]] from the plot of the evil [[Haman (Bible)|Haman]], who sought to [[genocide|exterminate]] them, as recorded in the biblical [[Book of Esther]]. It is characterized by public recitation of the Book of Esther, mutual gifts of food and drink, [[Alms|charity]] to the poor, and a celebratory meal (Esther 9:22). Other customs include drinking wine, eating special pastries called [[hamantash]]en, dressing up in masks and costumes, and organizing carnivals and parties.

Purim has celebrated annually on the 14th of the Hebrew month of [[Adar]], which occurs in February or March of the Gregorian calendar.

====Hanukkah====
{{Main article|Hanukkah}}

[[Hanukkah]] ({{lang-he|חֲנֻכָּה}}, "dedication") also known as the Festival of Lights, is an eight-day Jewish holiday that starts on the 25th day of [[Kislev]] ([[Hebrew calendar]]). The festival is observed in Jewish homes by the kindling of lights on each of the festival's eight nights, one on the first night, two on the second night and so on.

The holiday was called Hanukkah (meaning "dedication") because it marks the re-dedication of the Temple after its desecration by [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]]. Spiritually, Hanukkah commemorates the "Miracle of the Oil". According to the Talmud, at the re-dedication of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] following the victory of the [[Maccabees]] over the [[Seleucid Empire]], there was only enough consecrated [[oil]] to fuel the eternal flame in the Temple for one day. Miraculously, the oil burned for eight days – which was the length of time it took to press, prepare and consecrate new oil.

Hanukkah is not mentioned in the Bible and was never considered a major holiday in Judaism, but it has become much more visible and widely celebrated in modern times, mainly because it falls around the same time as Christmas and has national Jewish overtones that have been emphasized since the establishment of the State of Israel.

====Fast days====
{{Main article|Tisha B'Av|Seventeenth of Tamuz|10th of Tevet|Tzom Gedaliah}}
[[Tisha B'Av]] ({{lang-he|תשעה באב}} or {{lang|he|ט׳ באב}}, "the Ninth of [[Av (month)|Av]]") is a day of mourning and fasting commemorating the destruction of the [[First Temple|First]] and [[Second Temple]]s, and in later times, the [[Alhambra Decree|expulsion of the Jews from Spain]].

There are three more minor Jewish fast days that commemorate various stages of the destruction of the Temples. They are the [[Seventeenth of Tamuz|17th Tamuz]], the [[10th of Tevet]] and [[Tzom Gedaliah]] (the 3rd of Tishrei).

====Israeli holidays====
{{Main article|Yom Hashoah|Yom Hazikaron|Yom Ha'atzmaut}}
The modern holidays of [[Yom Ha-shoah]] (Holocaust Remembrance Day), [[Yom Hazikaron]] (Israeli Memorial Day) and [[Yom Ha'atzmaut]] (Israeli Independence Day) commemorate the horrors of the [[Holocaust]], the fallen soldiers of Israel and victims of terrorism, and Israeli independence, respectively.

There are some who prefer to commemorate those who were killed in the Holocaust on the [[Tenth of Tevet#Day of general kaddish|10th of Tevet]].

===Torah readings===
{{Main article|Torah reading}}
The core of festival and [[Shabbat]] prayer services is the public reading of the [[Torah]], along with connected readings from the other books of the [[Tanakh]], called [[Haftarah]]. Over the course of a year, the whole Torah is read, with the cycle starting over in the autumn, on [[Simchat Torah]].

===Synagogues and religious buildings===
{{Main article|Synagogue}}
[[File:Belz World Center Inside.jpg|right|thumb|Interior of the [[Belz Great Synagogue]] in Jerusalem.]]

Synagogues are Jewish houses of prayer and study. They usually contain separate rooms for prayer (the main sanctuary), smaller rooms for study, and often an area for community or educational use. There is no set blueprint for synagogues and the architectural shapes and interior designs of synagogues vary greatly. The Reform movement mostly refer to their synagogues as temples. Some traditional features of a synagogue are:
* The [[ark (synagogue)|ark]] (called ''aron ha-kodesh'' by [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazim]] and ''hekhal'' by [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardim]]) where the [[Torah]] scrolls are kept (the ark is often closed with an ornate curtain (''[[parochet]]'') outside or inside the ark doors);
* The elevated reader's platform (called ''[[Bema#Judaism|bimah]]'' by Ashkenazim and ''tebah'' by Sephardim), where the Torah is read (and services are conducted in Sephardi synagogues);
* The [[sanctuary lamp|eternal light]] (''ner tamid''), a continually lit lamp or lantern used as a reminder of the constantly lit [[Menorah (Temple)|menorah]] of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]]
* The pulpit, or ''amud'', a lectern facing the Ark where the [[hazzan]] or prayer leader stands while praying.

In addition to synagogues, other buildings of significance in Judaism include [[yeshiva]]s, or institutions of Jewish learning, and [[mikvah]]s, which are ritual baths.

===Dietary laws: ''kashrut''===
{{Main article|Kashrut}}

The Jewish dietary laws are known as ''[[kashrut]]''. Food prepared in accordance with them is termed [[kosher foods|kosher]], and food that is not kosher is also known as ''treifah'' or ''treif''. People who observe these laws are colloquially said to be "keeping kosher".&lt;ref name="JewFAQ Kashrut" /&gt;

Many of the laws apply to animal-based foods. For example, in order to be considered kosher, [[mammals]] must have split [[hooves]] and [[ruminants|chew their cud]]. The [[pig]] is arguably the most well-known example of a non-kosher animal.&lt;ref name="The Kosher Pig?" /&gt; Although it has split hooves, it does not chew its cud.&lt;ref name="Tamar Levy, St. Louis, MO – Block Yeshiva High School, Grade 9" /&gt; For [[seafood]] to be kosher, the animal must have [[fins]] and [[Scale (zoology)|scales]]. Certain types of seafood, such as [[shellfish]], [[crustaceans]], and [[eel]]s, are therefore considered non-kosher. Concerning birds, a list of non-kosher species is given in the [[Torah]]. The exact [[translations]] of many of the species have not survived, and some non-kosher birds' identities are no longer certain. However, [[traditions]] exist about the ''kashrut'' status of a few birds. For example, both [[chickens]] and [[turkeys]] are permitted in most communities. Other types of animals, such as [[amphibians]], [[reptiles]], and most [[insects]], are prohibited altogether.&lt;ref name="JewFAQ Kashrut" /&gt;

In addition to the requirement that the species be considered kosher, meat and poultry (but not fish) must come from a healthy animal slaughtered in a process known as ''[[shechitah]]''. Without the proper [[Animal slaughter|slaughtering]] practices even an otherwise kosher animal will be rendered ''treif''. The slaughtering process is intended to be quick and relatively painless to the animal. Forbidden parts of animals include the [[blood]], some [[fat]]s, and the area in and around the [[sciatic nerve]].&lt;ref name="JewFAQ Kashrut" /&gt;

Jewish law also forbids the consumption of meat and dairy products together. The waiting period between eating meat and eating dairy varies by the order in which they are consumed and by community, and can extend for up to six hours. Based on the Biblical injunction against cooking a kid in its mother's milk, this rule is mostly derived from the [[Oral Torah]], the [[Talmud]] and [[Rabbinic law]].&lt;ref name="JewFAQ Kashrut" /&gt; Chicken and other kosher birds are considered the same as meat under the laws of ''kashrut'', but the prohibition is Rabbinic, not Biblical.&lt;ref name="shulchan" /&gt;

The use of [[Dishware|dishes]], serving utensils, and [[oven]]s may make food ''treif'' that would otherwise be kosher. Utensils that have been used to prepare non-kosher food, or dishes that have held meat and are now used for dairy products, render the food ''treif'' under certain conditions.&lt;ref name="JewFAQ Kashrut" /&gt;

Furthermore, all [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] and some [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] authorities forbid the consumption of processed [[grape]] products made by non-Jews, due to ancient [[pagan]] practices of using wine in rituals.&lt;ref name="JewFAQ Kashrut" /&gt; Some Conservative authorities permit wine and grape juice made without rabbinic supervision.&lt;ref name="rabbinicalassembly" /&gt;

The [[Torah]] does not give specific reasons for most of the laws of ''kashrut''.&lt;ref name="JewFAQ Kashrut" /&gt; However, a number of explanations have been offered, including maintaining ritual purity, teaching impulse control, encouraging obedience to God, improving health, reducing [[cruelty to animals]] and preserving the distinctness of the Jewish community.&lt;ref name="Kashrut Facts" /&gt; The various categories of dietary laws may have developed for different reasons, and some may exist for multiple reasons. For example, people are forbidden from consuming the blood of birds and mammals because, according to the Torah, this is where animal souls are contained.&lt;ref name="Judaism 101: Kashrut: Jewish Dietary Laws" /&gt; In contrast, the Torah forbids Israelites from eating non-kosher species because "they are unclean".&lt;ref name="leviticus11" /&gt; The [[Kabbalah]] describes sparks of holiness that are released by the act of eating kosher foods, but are too tightly bound in non-kosher foods to be released by eating.&lt;ref name="Judaism and the Art of Eating" /&gt;

Survival concerns supersede all the laws of ''kashrut'', as they do for most [[halakha|halakhot]].&lt;ref name="jewishmag" /&gt;&lt;ref name="biu" /&gt;

===Laws of ritual purity===
{{Main article|Tumah}}
[[File:Шабатна кибритна кутија - Shabbat matchbox holder.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.15|A silver matchbox holder for ritual use on [[Shabbat]] with inscription in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]]]
The [[Tanakh]] describes circumstances in which a person who is ''tahor'' or ritually pure may become ''tamei'' or ritually impure. Some of these circumstances are contact with human [[corpses]] or [[grave (burial)|graves]], seminal flux, vaginal flux, [[menstruation]], and contact with people who have become impure from any of these.&lt;ref name="leviticus15" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bamidbar" /&gt; In Rabbinic Judaism, [[Kohanim]], members of the hereditary [[caste]] that served as [[priests]] in the time of the Temple, are mostly restricted from entering grave sites and touching dead bodies.&lt;ref name="Torah tidbits" /&gt; During the Temple period, such priests ([[Kohanim]]) were required to eat their bread offering ([[Terumah]]) in a state of ritual purity, which laws eventually led to more rigid laws being enacted, such as [[Handwashing in Judaism|hand-washing]] which became a requisite of all Jews before consuming ordinary bread.

====Family purity====
[[File:Fauteuil de circoncision ("Fauteuil d'Elie").jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|18th-century circumcision chair [[Musée d'Art et d'Histoire du Judaïsme|Museum of Jewish Art and History]]]]
{{Main article|Niddah}}

An important subcategory of the ritual purity laws relates to the segregation of menstruating [[women]]. These laws are also known as ''[[niddah]]'', literally "separation", or family purity. Vital aspects of halakha for traditionally observant Jews, they are not usually followed by Jews in liberal denominations.&lt;ref name="koshersex" /&gt;

Especially in [[Orthodox Judaism]], the Biblical laws are augmented by Rabbinical injunctions. For example, the [[Torah]] mandates that a woman in her normal menstrual period must abstain from [[sexual intercourse]] for seven days. A woman whose menstruation is prolonged must continue to abstain for seven more days after bleeding has stopped.&lt;ref name=leviticus15 /&gt; The Rabbis conflated ordinary ''niddah'' with this extended menstrual period, known in the Torah as ''[[zavah]]'', and mandated that a woman may not have sexual intercourse with her [[husband]] from the time she begins her [[Menstrual cycle|menstrual]] flow until seven days after it ends. In addition, [[Rabbinical law]] forbids the [[husband]] from touching or sharing a bed with his wife during this period. Afterwards, purification can occur in a ritual bath called a [[mikveh]].&lt;ref name=koshersex /&gt;

Traditional [[Ethiopian Jews]] keep menstruating women in separate [[huts]] and, similar to [[Karaite Judaism|Karaite practice]], do not allow menstruating women into their [[temples]] because of a temple's special sanctity. Emigration to [[Israel]] and the influence of other Jewish denominations have led to Ethiopian Jews adopting more normative Jewish practices.&lt;ref name="Karaites" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Women and water: menstruation in Jewish life and law" /&gt;

===Life-cycle events===
Life-cycle events, or [[rites of passage]], occur throughout a Jew's life that serves to strengthen Jewish identity and bind him/her to the entire community.
* [[Brit milah]]&amp;nbsp;– Welcoming male babies into the covenant through the rite of [[circumcision]] on their eighth day of life. The baby boy is also given his Hebrew name in the ceremony. A naming ceremony intended as a parallel ritual for girls, named ''[[zeved habat]]'' or brit bat, enjoys limited popularity.
* [[Bar Mitzvah / Bat Mitzvah|Bar mitzvah and Bat mitzvah]]&amp;nbsp;– This passage from childhood to adulthood takes place when a female Jew is twelve and a male Jew is thirteen years old among Orthodox and some Conservative congregations. In the Reform movement, both girls and boys have their bat/bar mitzvah at age thirteen. This is often commemorated by having the new adults, male only in the Orthodox tradition, lead the congregation in prayer and publicly read a "portion" of the Torah.
* [[Jewish views of marriage|Marriage]]&amp;nbsp;– Marriage is an extremely important lifecycle event. A wedding takes place under a ''[[chuppah]]'', or wedding canopy, which symbolizes a happy house. At the end of the ceremony, the groom breaks a glass with his foot, symbolizing the continuous mourning for the destruction of the Temple, and the scattering of the Jewish people.
* [[bereavement in Judaism|Death and Mourning]]&amp;nbsp;– Judaism has a multi-staged [[mourning]] practice. The first stage is called the [[shiva (Judaism)|shiva]] (literally "seven", observed for one week) during which it is traditional to sit at home and be comforted by friends and family, the second is the ''shloshim'' (observed for one month) and for those who have lost one of their parents, there is a third stage, ''avelut yud bet chodesh'', which is observed for eleven months.

==Community leadership==
===Classical priesthood===
[[File:Jewish Children with their Teacher in Samarkand.jpg|thumb|Jewish students with their teacher in [[Samarkand]], [[Uzbekistan]] c. 1910.]]
The role of the priesthood in Judaism has significantly diminished since the destruction of the [[Second Temple]] in 70 CE when priests attended to the Temple and sacrifices. The priesthood is an inherited position, and although priests no longer have any but ceremonial duties, they are still honored in many Jewish communities. Many Orthodox Jewish communities believe that they will be needed again for a future [[Third Temple]] and need to remain in readiness for future duty.
* [[Kohen]] (priest) – patrilineal descendant of [[Aaron]], brother of [[Moses]]. In the Temple, the ''kohanim'' were charged with performing the sacrifices. Today, a Kohen is the first one called up at the reading of the Torah, performs the [[Priestly Blessing]], as well as complying with other unique laws and ceremonies, including the ceremony of redemption of the first-born.
* Levi ([[Levite]]) – Patrilineal descendant of [[Levi]] the son of [[Jacob]]. In the [[Temple in Jerusalem]], the levites sang [[Psalms]], performed construction, maintenance, janitorial, and guard duties, assisted the priests, and sometimes interpreted the law and Temple ritual to the public. Today, a Levite is called up second to the reading of the Torah.

===Prayer leaders===
From the time of the [[Mishnah]] and [[Talmud]] to the present, Judaism has required specialists or authorities for the practice of very few rituals or ceremonies. A Jew can fulfill most requirements for prayer by himself. Some activities—reading the [[Torah]] and ''haftarah'' (a supplementary portion from the Prophets or Writings), the prayer for mourners, the blessings for bridegroom and bride, the complete grace after meals—require a ''[[minyan]]'', the presence of ten Jews.

The most common professional clergy in a [[synagogue]] are:
* [[Rabbi]] of a congregation – Jewish scholar who is charged with answering the legal questions of a congregation. This role requires ordination by the congregation's preferred authority (i.e., from a respected Orthodox rabbi or, if the congregation is Conservative or Reform, from academic seminaries). A congregation does not necessarily require a rabbi. Some congregations have a rabbi but also allow members of the congregation to act as ''shatz'' or ''baal kriyah'' (see below).
** Hassidic ''[[Rebbe]]'' – rabbi who is the head of a [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] dynasty.
* [[Hazzan]] (note: the "h" denotes [[voiceless pharyngeal fricative]]) (cantor) – a trained vocalist who acts as ''shatz''. Chosen for a good voice, knowledge of traditional tunes, understanding of the meaning of the prayers and sincerity in reciting them. A congregation does not need to have a dedicated hazzan.

Jewish prayer services do involve two specified roles, which are sometimes, but not always, filled by a rabbi or hazzan in many congregations. In other congregations these roles are filled on an ad-hoc basis by members of the congregation who lead portions of services on a rotating basis:
* Shaliach tzibur or ''Shatz'' (leader—literally "agent" or "representative"—of the congregation) leads those assembled in prayer and sometimes prays on behalf of the community. When a ''shatz'' recites a prayer on behalf of the congregation, he is ''not'' acting as an intermediary but rather as a facilitator. The entire congregation participates in the recital of such prayers by saying ''amen'' at their conclusion; it is with this act that the ''shatz's'' prayer becomes the prayer of the congregation. Any adult capable of reciting the prayers clearly may act as ''shatz''. In Orthodox congregations and some Conservative congregations, only men can be prayer leaders, but all [[Progressive Judaism|Progressive]] communities now allow women to serve in this function.
* The Baal kriyah or ''baal koreh'' (master of the reading) reads the weekly [[Torah]] portion. The requirements for being the ''baal kriyah'' are the same as those for the ''shatz''. These roles are not mutually exclusive. The same person is often qualified to fill more than one role and often does. Often there are several people capable of filling these roles and different services (or parts of services) will be led by each.

Many congregations, especially larger ones, also rely on a:
* [[Gabbai]] (sexton) – Calls people up to the Torah, appoints the ''shatz'' for each prayer session if there is no standard ''shatz'', and makes certain that the synagogue is kept clean and supplied.

The three preceding positions are usually voluntary and considered an honor. Since the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] large synagogues have often adopted the practice of hiring rabbis and hazzans to act as ''shatz'' and ''baal kriyah'', and this is still typically the case in many Conservative and Reform congregations. However, in most Orthodox synagogues these positions are filled by laypeople on a rotating or ad-hoc basis. Although most congregations hire one or more Rabbis, the use of a professional hazzan is generally declining in American congregations, and the use of professionals for other offices is rarer still.

===Specialized religious roles===
* ''[[Beth din#Officers of a beth din|Dayan]]'' (judge) – An ordained rabbi with special legal training who belongs to a ''[[beth din]]'' (rabbinical court). In Israel, religious courts handle marriage and divorce cases, conversion and financial disputes in the Jewish community.
* [[Mohel]] (circumciser) – An expert in the laws of circumcision who has received training from a previously qualified ''mohel'' and performs the ''[[brit milah]]'' (circumcision).
* [[shechita|Shochet]] (ritual slaughterer) – In order for meat to be kosher, it must be slaughtered by a ''shochet'' who is an expert in the laws of kashrut and has been trained by another ''shochet.''
* [[Sofer (scribe)|Sofer]] (scribe) – [[Torah]] scrolls, ''[[tefillin]]'' (phylacteries), ''[[mezuzah|mezuzot]]'' (scrolls put on doorposts), and ''gittin'' (bills of divorce) must be written by a ''sofer'' who is an expert in Hebrew calligraphy and has undergone rigorous training in the laws of writing sacred texts.
* [[Rosh yeshiva]] – A Torah scholar who runs a [[yeshiva]].
* [[Mashgiach ruchani|Mashgiach]] of a yeshiva – Depending on which yeshiva, might either be the person responsible for ensuring attendance and proper conduct, or even supervise the emotional and spiritual welfare of the students and give lectures on [[Mussar movement|mussar]] (Jewish ethics).
* [[Mashgiach]] – Supervises manufacturers of kosher food, importers, caterers and restaurants to ensure that the food is kosher. Must be an expert in the laws of [[kashrut]] and trained by a rabbi, if not a rabbi himself.

===Origins===

{{Further|Ancient Canaanite religion|Ancient Semitic religion}}
[[File:Duraeuropa-1-.gif|thumb|left|Scenes from the [[Book of Esther]] decorate the [[Dura-Europos synagogue]] dating from 244 CE]]
At its core, the Tanakh is an account of the [[Israelite]]s' relationship with [[God]] from their earliest history until the building of the [[Second Temple]] (c. 535 BCE). [[Abraham]] is hailed as the first [[Hebrews|Hebrew]] and the father of the Jewish people. As a reward for his act of faith in one God, he was promised that [[Isaac]], his second son, would inherit the [[Land of Israel]] (then called [[Canaan]]). Later, the descendants of Isaac's son [[Jacob]] were enslaved in [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], and God commanded [[Moses]] to lead [[the Exodus]] from Egypt. At [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]], they received the [[Torah]]—the five books of Moses. These books, together with [[Nevi'im]] and [[Ketuvim]] are known as ''Torah Shebikhtav'' as opposed to the [[Oral Torah]], which refers to the Mishnah and the Talmud. Eventually, God led them to the [[land of Israel]] where the [[tabernacle]] was planted in the city of [[Shiloh (Biblical)|Shiloh]] for over 300 years to rally the nation against attacking enemies. As time went on, the spiritual level of the nation declined to the point that God allowed the [[Philistines]] to capture the tabernacle. The people of Israel then told [[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]] the [[prophet]] that they needed to be governed by a permanent king, and Samuel appointed [[Saul the King|Saul]] to be their King. When the people pressured Saul into going against a command conveyed to him by Samuel, God told Samuel to appoint [[David]] in his stead.

[[File:Western wall jerusalem night.jpg|thumb|The [[Western Wall]] in [[Jerusalem]] is a remnant of the wall encircling the [[Second Temple]]. The [[Temple Mount]] is the holiest site in Judaism.]]

Once King David was established, he told the prophet [[Nathan (prophet)|Nathan]] that he would like to build a permanent temple, and as a reward for his actions, God promised David that he would allow his son, [[Solomon]], to build the [[Solomon's Temple|First Temple]] and the throne would never depart from his children.

Rabbinic tradition holds that the details and interpretation of the law, which are called the ''[[Oral Torah]]'' or ''[[Oral law#Oral law in Judaism|oral law]]'', were originally an unwritten tradition based upon what God told Moses on Mount Sinai. However, as the persecutions of the Jews increased and the details were in danger of being forgotten, these oral laws were recorded by [[Rabbi]] [[Judah HaNasi]] (Judah the Prince) in the [[Mishnah]], redacted ''circa'' 200 CE. The [[Talmud]] was a compilation of both the Mishnah and the [[Gemara]], rabbinic commentaries redacted over the next three centuries. The Gemara originated in two major centers of Jewish scholarship, [[Talmudic Academies in Syria Palaestina|Palestine]] and [[Talmudic Academies in Babylonia|Babylonia]].&lt;ref name="jewishencyclopedia.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/14213-talmud|title=Talmud|publisher=Jewish Encyclopedia|author=Wilhelm Bacher}}&lt;/ref&gt; Correspondingly, two bodies of analysis developed, and two works of Talmud were created. The older compilation is called the [[Jerusalem Talmud]]. It was compiled sometime during the 4th century in [[Talmudic Academies in Syria Palaestina|Palestine]].&lt;ref name="jewishencyclopedia.com"/&gt; The Babylonian Talmud was compiled from discussions in the houses of study by the scholars [[Ravina I]], [[Ravina II]], and [[Rav Ashi]] by 500 CE, although it continued to be edited later.

Some critical scholars oppose the view that the sacred texts, including the [[Tanakh|Hebrew Bible]], were divinely inspired. Many of these scholars accept the general principles of the [[documentary hypothesis]] and suggest that the [[Torah]] consists of inconsistent texts edited together in a way that calls attention to divergent accounts.&lt;ref name="yehezkal" /&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2017}}&lt;ref name="biblical" /&gt;&lt;ref name="speiser" /&gt; Many suggest that during the First Temple period, the people of Israel believed that each nation had its own god, but that their god was superior to other gods.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2017}}&lt;ref name="history12" /&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2017}} Some suggest that strict monotheism developed during the Babylonian Exile, perhaps in reaction to [[Zoroastrian]] dualism.&lt;ref name="ephraim" /&gt; In this view, it was only by the [[Hellenic period]] that most Jews came to believe that their god was the only god and that the notion of a clearly bounded Jewish nation identical with the Jewish religion formed.&lt;ref name="beginnings" /&gt;

[[John Day (Old Testament scholar)|John Day]] argues that the origins of biblical [[Yahweh]], [[El (deity)|El]], [[Asherah]], and [[Ba'al]], may be rooted in earlier [[Canaanite religion]], which was centered on a pantheon of gods much like the [[Greek pantheon]].&lt;ref name="goddesses" /&gt;

===Antiquity===
{{Main article|Ancient Israel and Judah|Babylonian captivity|Hellenistic Judaism|Hasmonean Kingdom|Iudaea Province|Bar Kokhba revolt}}

According to the [[Hebrew Bible]], the [[United Monarchy]] was established under [[Saul the King|Saul]] and continued under [[King David]] and [[Solomon]] with its capital in [[Jerusalem]]. After Solomon's reign, the nation split into two kingdoms, the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]] (in the north) and the [[Kingdom of Judah]] (in the south). The Kingdom of Israel was conquered by the [[Assyria]]n ruler [[Sargon II]] in the late 8th century BCE with many people from the capital Samaria being taken captive to Media and the [[Khabur (Euphrates)|Khabur River]] valley. The [[Kingdom of Judah]] continued as an independent state until it was conquered by a Babylonian army in the early 6th century BCE, destroying the [[First Temple]] that was at the center of ancient Jewish worship. The Judean elite was exiled to [[Babylonia]] and this is regarded as the first Jewish Diaspora. Later many of them returned to their homeland after the subsequent conquest of Babylonia by the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]] seventy years later, a period known as the [[Babylonian Captivity]]. A new [[Second Temple]] was constructed, and old religious practices were resumed.

During the early years of the Second Temple, the highest religious authority was a council known as the Great Assembly, led by Ezra of the Book of Ezra. Among other accomplishments of the Great Assembly, the last books of the Bible were written at this time and the canon sealed.

[[Hellenistic Judaism]] spread to [[Ptolemaic Egypt]] from the 3rd century BCE. After [[First Jewish–Roman War|the Great Revolt]] (66–73 CE), the Romans destroyed the Temple. [[Hadrian]] built a pagan idol on the Temple grounds and prohibited circumcision; these acts of ethnocide provoked the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]] 132–136 CE after which the Romans banned the study of the [[Torah]] and the celebration of Jewish holidays, and forcibly removed virtually all Jews from Judea. In 200 CE, however, Jews were granted Roman citizenship and Judaism was recognized as a ''[[religio licita]]'' ("legitimate religion") until the rise of [[Gnosticism]] and [[Early Christianity]] in the fourth century.

Following the destruction of Jerusalem and the expulsion of the Jews, Jewish worship stopped being centrally organized around the Temple, prayer took the place of sacrifice, and worship was rebuilt around the community (represented by a minimum of ten adult men) and the establishment of the authority of rabbis who acted as teachers and leaders of individual communities (see [[Jewish diaspora]]).

===Historical Jewish groupings (to 1700)===
[[File:Parochet of Beth Jakov Macedonia.jpg|thumb|The [[Torah Ark]] of the Beth Jakov synagogue in [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]]]
Around the 1st century CE, there were several small Jewish sects: the [[Pharisees]], [[Sadducees]], [[Zealots]], [[Essenes]], and [[early Christianity|Christians]]. After the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, these sects vanished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sara E. Karesh|author2=Mitchell M. Hurvitz|title=Encyclopedia of Judaism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z2cCZBDm8F8C&amp;pg=PA444|year=2005|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-0-8160-6982-8|pages=444–|quote=The Sadducees disappeared when the second Temple was destroyed in the year 70 C.E and Pharisaic Judaism became the preeminent Jewish sect.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christianity]] survived, but by breaking with Judaism and [[Schism (religion)|becoming a separate religion]]; the [[Pharisees]] survived but in the form of [[Rabbinic Judaism]] (today, known simply as "Judaism"). The [[Sadducees]] rejected the [[Revelation|divine inspiration]] of the [[Nevi'im|Prophets]] and the [[Ketuvim|Writings]], relying only on the [[Torah]] as divinely inspired. Consequently, a number of other core tenets of the Pharisees' belief system (which became the basis for modern Judaism), were also dismissed by the Sadducees. (The [[Samaritans]] practiced a similar religion, which is traditionally considered separate from Judaism.)

Like the Sadducees who relied only on the Torah, some Jews in the 8th and 9th centuries rejected the authority and divine inspiration of the [[oral law]] as recorded in the [[Mishnah]] (and developed by later rabbis in the two [[Talmud]]s), relying instead only upon the [[Tanakh]]. These included the Isunians, the Yudganites, the [[Malikites]], and others. They soon developed oral traditions of their own, which differed from the rabbinic traditions, and eventually formed the [[Karaism|Karaite]] sect. Karaites exist in small numbers today, mostly living in Israel. Rabbinical and Karaite Jews each hold that the others are Jews, but that the other faith is erroneous.

Over a long time, Jews formed distinct ethnic groups in several different geographic areas—amongst others, the [[Ashkenazi Jews]] (of [[Central Europe|central]] and [[Eastern Europe]]), the [[Sephardi Jews]] (of Spain, [[Portugal]], and [[North Africa]]), the [[Beta Israel]] of [[Ethiopia]], and the [[Yemenite Jews]] from the southern tip of the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. Many of these groups have developed differences in their prayers, traditions and accepted canons; however, these distinctions are mainly the result of their being formed at some cultural distance from normative (rabbinic) Judaism, rather than based on any doctrinal dispute.

===Persecutions===
{{Main article|Persecution of Jews|Antisemitism|History of antisemitism}}
[[Antisemitism]] arose during the [[Middle Ages]], in the form of persecutions, [[pogrom]]s, [[forced conversion]]s, expulsions, social restrictions and [[ghetto]]ization.

This was different in quality from the repressions of Jews which had occurred in ancient times. Ancient repressions were politically motivated and Jews were treated the same as members of other ethnic groups. With the rise of the Churches, the main motive for attacks on Jews changed from politics to religion and the religious motive for such attacks was specifically derived from Christian views about Jews and Judaism.&lt;ref name="History, religion, and antisemitism" /&gt; During the [[Middle Ages]], Jewish people who lived under Muslim rule generally experienced tolerance and integration,&lt;ref name="Cohen, Mark R 1991"&gt;Cohen, Mark R. "[https://www.academia.edu/6560487/Neo_lachrymose_Conception_of_Jewish-Arab_History The Neo-Lachrymose Conception of Jewish-Arab History]." ''Tikkun'' 6.3 (1991)&lt;/ref&gt; but there were occasional outbreaks of violence like [[Almohads#Status of non-Muslims|Almohad's persecutions]].&lt;ref name="ugr"&gt;Amira K. Bennison and María Ángeles Gallego. "[http://www.ugr.es/~estsemi/miscelanea/57/3.Gallego.08,33-51.pdf Jewish Trading in Fes On The Eve of the Almohad Conquest]." MEAH, sección Hebreo 56 (2007), 33–51&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hasidism===
{{Main article|Hasidic Judaism}}

Hasidic Judaism was founded by [[Yisroel ben Eliezer (The Baal Shem Tov)|Yisroel ben Eliezer]] (1700–1760), also known as the ''Ba'al Shem Tov'' (or ''Besht''). It originated in a time of persecution of the Jewish people when European Jews had turned inward to Talmud study; many felt that most expressions of Jewish life had become too "academic", and that they no longer had any emphasis on spirituality or joy. Its adherents favored small and informal gatherings called [[Shtiebel]], which, in contrast to a traditional synagogue, could be used both as a place of worship and for celebrations involving dancing, eating, and socializing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=How and Why Did Hasidism Spread?|last=Stampfer|first=Shaul|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel|pages=205–207}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ba'al Shem Tov's disciples attracted many followers; they themselves established numerous Hasidic sects across Europe. Unlike other religions, which typically expanded through word of mouth or by use of print, Hasidism spread largely owing to [[Tzadik]]s, who used their influence to encourage others to follow the movement. Hasidism appealed to many Europeans because it was easy to learn, did not require full immediate commitment, and presented a compelling spectacle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=How and Why Did Hasidism Spread?|last=Stampfer|first=Shaul|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel|pages=202–204}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hasidic Judaism eventually became the way of life for many Jews in Eastern Europe. Waves of Jewish immigration in the 1880s carried it to the United States. The movement itself claims to be nothing new, but a ''refreshment'' of original Judaism. As some have put it: ''"they merely re-emphasized that which the generations had lost"''. Nevertheless, early on there was a serious schism between Hasidic and non-Hasidic Jews. European Jews who rejected the Hasidic movement were dubbed by the Hasidim as [[Misnagdim]], (lit. "opponents"). Some of the reasons for the rejection of Hasidic Judaism were the exuberance of Hasidic worship, its deviation from tradition in ascribing infallibility and miracles to their leaders, and the concern that it might become a messianic sect. Over time differences between the Hasidim and their opponents have slowly diminished and both groups are now considered part of [[Haredi Judaism]].

===The Enlightenment and new religious movements===
{{Main article|Haskalah|Jewish religious movements}}

In the late 18th century CE, Europe was swept by a group of intellectual, social and political movements known as the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. The Enlightenment led to reductions in the European laws that prohibited Jews to interact with the wider secular world, thus allowing Jews access to secular education and experience. A parallel Jewish movement, [[Haskalah]] or the "Jewish Enlightenment", began, especially in [[Central Europe]] and [[Western Europe]], in response to both the Enlightenment and these new freedoms. It placed an emphasis on integration with secular society and a pursuit of non-religious knowledge through reason. With the promise of political emancipation, many Jews saw no reason to continue to observe Jewish law and increasing numbers of Jews assimilated into Christian Europe. Modern religious movements of Judaism all formed in reaction to this trend.

In [[Central Europe]], followed by [[Great Britain]] and the United States, [[Reform Judaism|Reform (or Liberal) Judaism]] developed, relaxing legal obligations (especially those that limited Jewish relations with non-Jews), emulating [[Protestant]] decorum in prayer, and emphasizing the ethical values of Judaism's Prophetic tradition. [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]] developed in reaction to Reform Judaism, by leaders who argued that Jews could participate in public life as citizens equal to Christians while maintaining the observance of Jewish law. Meanwhile, in the United States, wealthy Reform Jews helped European scholars, who were Orthodox in practice but critical (and skeptical) in their study of the Bible and Talmud, to establish a seminary to train rabbis for immigrants from Eastern Europe. These left-wing Orthodox rabbis were joined by right-wing Reform rabbis who felt that Jewish law should not be entirely abandoned, to form the [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative movement]]. Orthodox Jews who opposed the Haskalah formed [[Haredi Orthodox Judaism]]. After massive movements of Jews following [[The Holocaust]] and the creation of [[Israel|the state of Israel]], these movements have competed for followers from among traditional Jews in or from other countries.

===Spectrum of observance===
[[File:KnesetEliyahooSynagogue.JPG|thumb|Judaism is practised in all parts of the world, for example in a synagogue in downtown [[Mumbai]].]]
Countries such as the [[United States]], [[Israel]], [[Canada]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Argentina]] and [[South Africa]] contain large Jewish populations. Jewish religious practice varies widely through all levels of observance. According to the 2001 edition of the [[National Jewish Population Survey]], in the United States' Jewish community—the world's second largest—4.3&amp;nbsp;million Jews out of 5.1&amp;nbsp;million had some sort of connection to the religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishdatabank.org/studies/details.cfm?StudyID=307 |title=National Jewish Population Survey (NJPS) 2000–01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of that population of connected Jews, 80% participated in some sort of Jewish religious observance, but only 48% belonged to a congregation, and fewer than 16% attend regularly.&lt;ref name="harrisinteractive" /&gt;

Birth rates for American Jews have dropped from 2.0 to 1.7.&lt;ref name="relations" /&gt; (Replacement rate is 2.1.) Intermarriage rates range from 40–50% in the US, and only about a third of children of intermarried couples are raised as Jews. Due to intermarriage and low birth rates, the Jewish population in the US shrank from 5.5&amp;nbsp;million in 1990 to 5.1&amp;nbsp;million in 2001. This is indicative of the general population trends among the Jewish community in the [[Diaspora]], but a focus on total population obscures growth trends in some denominations and communities, such as [[Haredi Judaism]]. The [[Baal teshuva]] movement is a movement of Jews who have "returned" to religion or become more observant.

==Judaism and other religions==
===Christianity and Judaism===
{{Main article|Christianity and Judaism}}
{{See also|Christianity and antisemitism|Christian–Jewish reconciliation}}
[[Christianity]] was originally a sect of [[Second Temple Judaism]], but the two religions [[Split of early Christianity and Judaism|diverged in the first century]]. The differences between Christianity and Judaism originally centered on whether Jesus was the Jewish Messiah but eventually became irreconcilable. Major differences between the two faiths include the nature of the Messiah, of [[Atonement in Judaism|atonement]] and [[Jewish views on sin|sin]], the status of God's commandments to Israel, and perhaps most significantly of the [[God in Judaism|nature of God]] himself. Due to these differences, Judaism traditionally regards Christianity as [[Shituf]] or worship of the God of Israel which is not monotheistic. Christianity has traditionally regarded Judaism as obsolete with the invention of Christianity and Jews as a people replaced by the Church, though a Christian belief in [[dual-covenant theology]] emerged as a phenomenon following Christian reflection on how their theology influenced the Nazi [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]].&lt;ref&gt;R. Kendall Soulen, The God of Israel and Christian Theology, (Minneapolis: Fortress, 1996) {{ISBN|978-0-8006-2883-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the time of the [[History of Christianity during the Middle Ages|Middle Ages]], the [[Catholic Church]] upheld the ''[[Sicut Judaeis|Constitution pro Judæis]]'' (Formal Statement on the Jews), which stated {{quotation|We decree that no Christian shall use violence to force them to be baptized, so long as they are unwilling and refuse. ... Without the judgment of the political authority of the land, no Christian shall presume to wound them or kill them or rob them of their money or change the good customs that they have thus far enjoyed in the place where they live."&lt;ref name="BaskinSeeskin2010"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baskin|first1=Judith R.|last2=Seeskin|first2=Kenneth|title=The Cambridge Guide to Jewish History, Religion, and Culture|date=12 July 2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521869607|page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Until [[Jewish emancipation|their emancipation]] in the late 18th and the 19th century, Jews in Christian lands were subject to humiliating legal restrictions and limitations. They included provisions requiring Jews to wear specific and identifying clothing such as the [[Jewish hat]] and the [[yellow badge]], restricting Jews to certain cities and towns or in certain parts of towns ([[Jewish ghettos in Europe|ghettos]]), and forbidding Jews to enter certain trades (for example selling new clothes in medieval [[Sweden]]). Disabilities also included special taxes levied on Jews, exclusion from public life, restraints on the performance of religious ceremonies, and linguistic censorship. Some countries went even further and completely expelled Jews, for example, [[Edict of Expulsion|England]] in 1290 (Jews were readmitted in 1655) and [[Expulsion of the Jews from Spain|Spain]] in 1492 (readmitted in 1868). The first Jewish settlers in North America arrived in the Dutch colony of [[New Amsterdam]] in 1654; they were forbidden to hold public office, open a retail shop, or establish a synagogue. When the colony was seized by the British in 1664 Jewish rights remained unchanged, but by 1671 [[Asser Levy]] was the first Jew to serve on a jury in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/US-Israel/amsterdam.html |title=New Amsterdam's Jewish Crusader |publisher=[[Jewish Virtual Library]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1791, [[French Revolution|Revolutionary France]] was the first country to abolish disabilities altogether, followed by [[Prussia]] in 1848. [[Emancipation of the Jews in the United Kingdom]] was achieved in 1858 after an almost 30-year struggle championed by [[Isaac Lyon Goldsmid]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/237923/Sir-Isaac-Lyon-Goldsmid-1st-Baronet#ref213807 |title=Sir Isaac Lyon Goldsmid, 1st Baronet| publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the ability of Jews to sit in parliament with the passing of the [[Jews Relief Act 1858]]. The newly united [[German Empire]] in 1871 abolished Jewish disabilities in Germany, which were reinstated in the [[Nuremberg Laws]] in 1935.

Jewish life in Christian lands was marked by frequent [[blood libel]]s, expulsions, [[forced conversion]]s and [[massacre]]s. An underlying source of prejudice against Jews in Europe was religious. Christian rhetoric and antipathy towards Jews developed in the [[Apostolic Age|early years of Christianity]] and was reinforced by ever increasing anti-Jewish measures over the [[Early Christianity|ensuing centuries]]. The action taken by Christians against Jews included acts of violence, and murder culminating in the [[Holocaust]].&lt;ref name="HarriesAfter" /&gt;{{rp|21}}&lt;ref name="Kung" /&gt;{{rp|169}}&lt;ref name="Dawidowicz" /&gt; These attitudes were reinforced in Christian preaching, art and popular teaching for two millennia, containing contempt for Jews,&lt;ref name=JCPSHorst&gt;Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs. 5 May 2009.

One of these was the Confessing Church, a Protestant denomination formed in May 1934, the year after Hitler became chancellor of Germany. One of its goals was to repeal the Nazi law "which required that the civil service would be purged of all those who were either Jewish or of partly Jewish descent." Another was to help those "who suffered through repressive laws, or violence." About 7,000 of the 17,000 Protestant clergy in Germany joined the Confessing Church. Much of their work has one unrecognized, but two who will never forget them are Max Krakauer and his wife. Sheltered in sixty-six houses and helped by more than eighty individuals who belonged to the Confessing Church, they owe them their lives. German Catholic churches went out of their way to protect Catholics of Jewish ancestry. More inclusive was the principled stand taken by Catholic Bishop Clemens Count von Galen of Munster. He publicly denounced the Nazi slaughter of Jews and actually succeeded in having the problem halted for a short time. ... Members of the Society of Friends—German Quakers working with organizations of Friends from other countries—were particularly successful in rescuing Jews. ... Jehovah's Witnesses, themselves targeted for concentration camps, also provided help to Jews.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The attitude of Christians and Christian Churches toward the Jewish people and Judaism, have been changed mostly positive since [[World War II]]. Pope [[John Paul II]] and the Catholic Church have "upheld the Church's acceptance of the continuing and permanent election of the Jewish people" as well as a [[Dual-covenant theology|reaffirmation of the covenant]] between [[God in Christianity|God]] and the Jews.&lt;ref name="Wigoder1988"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wigoder|first=Geoffrey|title=Jewish-Christian Relations Since the Second World War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9N9RAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA87|accessdate=14 January 2017|year=1988|publisher=Manchester University Press|language=English|isbn=9780719026393|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2015, the [[Holy See|Vatican]] released a 10,000-word document that, among other things, stated that Catholics should work with Jews to fight antisemitism.&lt;ref name="news.va"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.va/en/news/vatican-issues-new-document-on-christian-jewish-di|title=Vatican issues new document on Christian-Jewish dialogue|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam and Judaism===
{{Main article|Islam and Judaism}}
Both Judaism and [[Islam]] arose from the patriarch [[Abraham]], and they are therefore considered [[Abrahamic religions]]. In both Jewish and [[Muslim]] tradition, the Jewish and [[Arabs|Arab peoples]] are descended from the two sons of Abraham—[[Isaac]] and [[Ishmael]], respectively. While both religions are [[Monotheism|monotheistic]] and share many commonalities, they differ based on the fact that Jews do not consider [[Jesus in Islam|Jesus]] or [[Muhammad]] to be prophets. The religions' adherents have interacted with each other since the 7th century when [[Islam]] originated and spread in the [[Arabian peninsula]]. Indeed, the years 712 to 1066 CE under the [[Ummayad]] and the [[Abbasid]] rulers have been called the [[Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain]]. Non-Muslim monotheists living in these countries, including Jews, were known as [[dhimmis]]. Dhimmis were allowed to practice their own religions and administer their own internal affairs, but they were subject to certain restrictions that were not imposed on Muslims.&lt;ref name="Lewis-84" /&gt; For example, they had to pay the [[jizya]], a per capita tax imposed on free adult non-Muslim males,&lt;ref name="Lewis-84" /&gt; and they were also forbidden to bear arms or testify in court cases involving Muslims.&lt;ref name="lewis14" /&gt; Many of the laws regarding dhimmis were highly symbolic. For example, dhimmis in some countries were required to wear [[Yellow badge|distinctive clothing]], a practice not found in either the [[Qur'an]] or the [[hadiths]] but invented in [[Early Middle Ages|early medieval]] [[Baghdad]] and inconsistently enforced.&lt;ref name="lewis15" /&gt; Jews in Muslim countries were not entirely free from persecution—for example, many were killed, exiled or forcibly converted in the 12th century, in [[Persia]], and by the rulers of the [[Almohad]] dynasty in North Africa and [[Al-Andalus]],&lt;ref name="stillman" /&gt; as well as by the Zaydi imams of Yemen in the 17th century (see: [[Mawza Exile]]). At times, Jews were also restricted in their choice of residence—in [[Morocco]], for example, Jews were confined to walled quarters ([[mellah]]s) beginning in the 15th century and increasingly since the early 19th century.&lt;ref name="lewis16" /&gt;

In the mid-20th century, Jews were expelled from nearly all of the Arab countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meforum.org/263/why-jews-fled-the-arab-countries "Why Jews Fled the Arab Countries"]. ''Middle East Forum''. Retrieved on 28 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shumsky, Dmitry.

'Haaretz''. Retrieved on 2013-07-28.&lt;/ref&gt; Most have chosen to live in [[Israel]]. Today, antisemitic themes including [[Holocaust denial]] have become commonplace in the propaganda of Islamic movements such as [[Hizbullah]] and [[Hamas]], in the pronouncements of various agencies of the [[Islamic Republic of Iran]], and even in the newspapers and other publications of [[Refah Partisi]].&lt;ref name="Lewis_MEQ" /&gt;

===Syncretic movements incorporating Judaism===
There are some movements that combine elements of Judaism with those of other religions. The most well-known of these is [[Messianic Judaism]], a religious movement, which arose in the 1960s,&lt;ref name=Feher1998p140 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ariel2006p191b /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ariel2006p194a /&gt;&lt;ref name =Meltonp373a /&gt; that incorporates elements of Judaism with the [[Christianity#Beliefs|tenets of Christianity]].&lt;ref name =Meltonp373a /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ariel2006p191a /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ariel2006p194b /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sherbok_179" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ariel2000p223 /&gt; The movement generally states that [[Jesus]] is the Jewish Messiah, that he is one of the [[Trinity|Three Divine Persons]],&lt;ref name="UMJC-3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Trinitarianism" /&gt; and that [[Salvation (Christianity)|salvation]] is only achieved through acceptance of Jesus as one's savior.&lt;ref name="JeC3" /&gt; Some members of the movement argue that Messianic Judaism is a sect of Judaism.&lt;ref name="MJSelfID" /&gt; Jewish organizations of every denomination reject this, stating that Messianic Judaism is a Christian sect, because it teaches creeds which are identical to those of [[Pauline Christianity]].&lt;ref name="Denominations" /&gt;

Other examples of [[syncretism]] include [[Semitic neopaganism]], a loosely organized sect which incorporates [[Paganism|pagan]] or [[Wicca]]n beliefs with some Jewish religious practices; [[Jewish Buddhists]], another loosely organized group that incorporates elements of Asian spirituality in their faith; and some [[Jewish Renewal|Renewal Jews]] who borrow freely and openly from [[Buddhism]], [[Sufism]], [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] religions, and other faiths.

The [[Kabbalah Centre]], which employs teachers from multiple religions, is a [[New Age]] movement that claims to popularize the [[kabbalah]], part of the [[Jewish mysticism|Jewish esoteric tradition]].

This universal humanity, however, was predicated (and still is) on the dualism of the flesh and the spirit, such that while the body is particular, marked through practice as Jew or Greek, and through anatomy as male or female, the spirit is universal. Paul did not, however, reject the body—as did, for instance, the gnostics—but rather promoted a system whereby the body had its place, albeit subordinated to the spirit. Paul's anthropological dualism was matched by a hermeneutical dualism as well. Just as the human being is divided into a fleshy and a spiritual component, so also is language itself. It is composed of outer, material signs and inner, spiritual significations. When this is applied to the religious system that Paul inherited, the physical, fleshy signs of the Torah, of historical Judaism, are re-interpreted as symbols of that which Paul takes to be universal requirements and possibilities for humanity. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

|chapter= Chapter 20: The Rise of Messianic Judaism
|chapterurl=
|quote= Messianic Judaism, although it advocated the idea of an independent movement of Jewish converts, remained the offspring of the missionary movement, and the ties would never be broken. The rise of Messianic Judaism was, in many ways, a logical outcome of the ideology and rhetoric of the movement to evangelize the Jews as well as its early sponsorship of various forms of Hebrew Christian expressions. The missions have promoted the message that Jews who had embraced Christianity were not betraying their heritage or even their faith but were actually fulfilling their true Jewish selves by becoming Christians. The missions also promoted the dispensationalist idea that the Church equals the body of the true Christian believers and that Christians were defined by their acceptance of Jesus as their personal Savior and not by their affiliations with specific denominations and particular liturgies or modes of prayer. Missions had been using Jewish symbols in their buildings and literature and called their centers by Hebrew names such as Emanuel or Beth Sar Shalom. Similarly, the missions' publications featured Jewish religious symbols and practices such as the lighting of a menorah. Although missionaries to the Jews were alarmed when they first confronted the more assertive and independent movement of Messianic Judaism, it was they who were responsible for its conception and indirectly for its birth. The ideology, rhetoric, and symbols they had promoted for generations provided the background for the rise of a new movement that missionaries at first rejected as going too far but later accepted and even embraced.

Unlike the previous communities of Jewish Christians, Messianic Jewish congregations were largely independent of control from missionary societies or Christian denominations, even though they still wanted the acceptance of the larger evangelical community.

|quote=When the term resurfaced in Israel in the 1940s and 1950s, it designated all Jews who accepted Christianity in its Protestant evangelical form. Missionaries such as the Southern Baptist Robert Lindsey noted that for Israeli Jews, the term ''nozrim'', "Christians" in Hebrew, meant, almost automatically, an alien, hostile religion. Because such a term made it nearly impossible to convince Jews that Christianity was their religion, missionaries sought a more neutral term, one that did not arouse negative feelings. They chose ''Meshichyim'', Messianic, to overcome the suspicion and antagonism of the term ''nozrim''. ''Meshichyim'' as a term also had the advantage of emphasizing messianism as a major component of the Christian evangelical belief that the missions and communities of Jewish converts to Christianity propagated. It conveyed the sense of a new, innovative religion rather that''{{sic}}'' an old, unfavorable one. The term was used in reference to those Jews who accepted Jesus as their personal savior, and did not apply to Jews accepting Roman Catholicism who in Israel have called themselves Hebrew Christians. The term Messianic Judaism was adopted in the United States in the early 1970s by those converts to evangelical Christianity who advocated a more assertive attitude on the part of converts towards their Jewish roots and heritage.

The name may have changed over the course of time, but all of the names reflect the same phenomenon: one who asserts that s/he is straddling the theological fence between Christianity and Judaism, but in truth is firmly on the Christian side....we must affirm as did the Israeli Supreme Court in the well-known Brother Daniel case that to adopt Christianity is to have crossed the line out of the Jewish community.

 |quote=Missionary Impossible, an imaginative video and curriculum guide for teachers, educators, and rabbis to teach Jewish youth how to recognize and respond to "Jews-for-Jesus," "Messianic Jews," and other Christian proselytizers, has been produced by six rabbinic students at Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion's Cincinnati School. The students created the video as a tool for teaching why Jewish college and high school youth and Jews in intermarried couples are primary targets of Christian missionaries.

 |quote='''''What is ALEPH's position on so called messianic Judaism?''''' ALEPH has a policy of respect for other spiritual traditions, but objects to deceptive practices and will not collaborate with denominations which actively target Jews for recruitment. Our position on so-called "Messianic Judaism" is that it is Christianity and its proponents would be more honest to call it that.

| quote = To convert to the Jewish sect of HaDerech, accepting Yeshua as your King is the first act after one's heart turns toward HaShem and His Torah – as one can not obey a commandment of God if they first do not love God, and we love God by following his Messiah. Without first accepting Yeshua as the King and thus obeying Him, then getting circumcised for the purpose of Jewish conversion only gains you access to the Jewish community. It means nothing when it comes to inheriting a place in the World to Come.... Getting circumcised apart from desiring to be obedient to HaShem, and apart from accepting Yeshua as your King, is nothing but a surgical procedure, or worse, could lead to you believe that Jewish identity grants you a portion in the World to Come – at which point, what good is Messiah Yeshua, the Word of HaShem to you? He would have died for nothing!... As a convert from the nations, part of your obligation in keeping the Covenant, if you are a male, is to get circumcised in fulfillment of the commandment regarding circumcision. Circumcision is not an absolute requirement of being a Covenant member (that is, being made righteous before HaShem, and thus obtaining eternal life), but it is a requirement of obedience to God's commandments, because circumcision is commanded for those who are of the seed of Abraham, whether born into the family, adopted, or converted....If after reading all of this you understand what circumcision is, and that is an act of obedience, rather than an act of gaining favor before HaShem for the purpose of receiving eternal life, then if you are male believer in Yeshua the Messiah for the redemption from death, the consequence of your sin of rebellion against Him, then pursue circumcision, and thus conversion into Judaism, as an act of obedience to the Messiah.

''Karakia'' are generally used to increase the spiritual goodwill of a gathering, so as to increase the likelihood of a favourable outcome. They are also considered a formal greeting when beginning a [[ceremony]]. According to legend, there was a curse on the [[Waiapu River]] which was lifted when [[George Gage (Ringatū minister)|George Gage]] (Hori Keeti) performed ''karakia''. In the [[Māori religion]], ''karakia'' are used to [[ritual|ritually cleanse]] the homes of the deceased after a burial. 

The missionary [[Richard Taylor (missionary) | Richard Taylor]] gives a 19th-century view of the traditional role and scope of ''karakia'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The word ''karakia'', which we use for prayer, formerly meant a spell, charm, or incantation [...] [Maori] have spells suited for all circumstances - to conquer enemies, catch fish, trap rats, and snare birds, to make their kumara grow, and even to bind the obstinate will of woman; to find anything lost; to discover a stray dog; a concealed enemy; in fact, for all their wants. These karakias are extremely numerous [...]&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

With the nineteenth-century introduction of Christianity to New Zealand, Māori adopted (or wrote new)  karakia to acknowledge the new faith. Modern karakia tend to contain a blend of Christian and traditional influence, and their poetic language may make literal translations into English not always possible.&lt;ref name="Otago"&gt;"[http://maori.otago.ac.nz/reo-tikanga-treaty/te-reo/karakia Karakia]", Otago University website. Retrieved 23 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern Māori society, performances of ''karakia'' frequently open important meetings and ceremonies, both within a Māori context (such as tribal [[Hui (Māori assembly)|hui]], [[tangihanga|tangi]], or the inauguration of new [[marae]]), and in a wider New Zealand setting in which both Māori and [[Pākehā]] participate (such as the beginning of public meetings or at the departure of official delegations for overseas).

'''''Libertas ecclesiae''''' ("freedom of the Church" in [[Latin]]) is the notion of freedom of ecclesiastical authority from secular or the temporal power, which guided the [[Gregorian Reform|Reform]] movement which began in the 11th century.

==Description==
After the decentralization of the post-Carolingian period, this became the slogan of the Church in light of disapproval over lay warlords installing themselves as abbots and other high-profile churchmen. Unfit to perform theological functions, much less to defend the interests of the Church, these warlords viewed Church property as an extension of their own landholdings.

What resulted was the plunder of movable wealth (of which the monasteries had become the keepers during the period of Viking invasion) and the parcelling out of land and office as the temporal powers saw fit. This sorry state of the Church prompted enthusiasm for 'freeing' it from the direct control of these milites; Gregory VII helped frame this goal through the specifics of his reform program.

In addition to calling for spiritually pure figures at the helm of the Church, Gregory VII addressed the practical problems of pluralism (holding more than one church office) and poorly educated clerics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8606">'''Mesopotamian prayer''' are the [[prayer]]s of the place and era known as [[Mesopotamia#Religion and philosophy|ancient Mesopotamia]]. There are nine classifications of poem used within Mesopotamia.

==Prayers==
A definition of prayers of Mesopotamia is "''praise to god followed by request''" (this definition is according to ''T. Oshima'').&lt;ref name="Review (2012) by [[Journal of Hebrew Scriptures]] (designation DOI:10.5508/jhs.2012.v12.r17)  of"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.jhsonline.org/reviews/reviews_new/review590.htm|author=Review (2012) by [[Journal of Hebrew Scriptures]] (designation DOI:10.5508/jhs.2012.v12.r17)  of|title=Oshima, T (author) - ''Babylonian Prayers to Marduk''|publisher={{ISBN|978-3-16-150831-8}}|accessdate=2015-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to one source (Bromiley) the form of the word, known and used to signify  prayers during the  Mesopotamian era, is described today as šu-il-lá. With regards to šu-il-lá, the scholars ''Lambert'', ''van der Toorn'' and ''Oshima'' posit an alternative use for the term, which they submit is instead with reference to the way in which a prayer is to be recited, not a general signifier (rubric) for prayer itself (a notion expressed by ''Bromiley'').&lt;ref name="Review (2012) by [[Journal of Hebrew Scriptures]] (designation DOI:10.5508/jhs.2012.v12.r17)  of"/&gt;&lt;ref name="G.W. Bromiley"/&gt;

Šu-il-lá  is held to refer to an act of praying, by prayer exhibited by either ''lifting of hands'', ''to lift hands'', or ''to lift the hand''.&lt;ref name="Frechett, C.G."&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.jhsonline.org/reviews/reviews_new/review684.htm|author=Frechett, C.G.|title=Mesopotamian Ritual-prayers of "Hand-lifting" (Akkadian šuillas): An Investigation of Function in Light of the Idiomatic Meaning of the Rubric|publisher=Ugarit Verlag, 2012 {{ISBN|978-3-86835-046-3}}|accessdate=2015-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Prayers are divided into the following [[Categorization|classifications]]: [[Incantation]] prayers, Ershaḫungas, [[Petition|Gottesbriefe]], [[Divination|Ikribus]], Royal,  Tamitas and other queries, [[Hymns]], Šigû, and Namburbi.&lt;ref name="G.W.

===Incantation===
Tribal specialists in ritual were required to perform incantations to accompany the  use of texts known, for example, from Ugarit which are attested to contain ways to aid in the removal of snake-venom. Ugarit is also known to have contained additional health-related incantation texts.&lt;ref&gt;S I Johnston - [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uvtebmqZZDYC&amp;pg=PA460&amp;lpg=PA460&amp;dq=Incantation+prayers+of+Mesopotamia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SUkJ-Bh04K&amp;sig=g-qHVj5Mw19pV3CG3iuorTaMZNc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ywhaVbD3NqGV7Ab4woDwCA&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Incantation%20prayers%20of%20Mesopotamia&amp;f=false Religions of the Ancient World: A Guide (p.459-460)] Harvard University Press, 2004 {{ISBN|0674015177}} (697 pages) ''Volume 18 of Harvard University Press reference library'' [Retrieved 2015-05-16]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gottesbriefe===
The term ''Gottesbriefe'' is literally, petition-prayers, or letter prayers.&lt;ref&gt;K Takai - [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=CO5jpwAACAAJ&amp;dq=Gottesbriefe+prayers+Babylonia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=kRBaVYTZCKXN7QbRjIGwDA&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAA Old Babylonian Letter of Petition and Later Individual Lament Prayers] BiblioBazaar, 2011 {{ISBN|1243614951}} [Retrieved 2015-05-18]&lt;/ref&gt; They were mostly in the form of pleas for relief from illness and for the deliverance of personal longevity.&lt;ref name="G.W. Bromiley"/&gt;

===Ikribus===
These prayers were performed for the purposes of divining.&lt;ref&gt;F.H. Cryer - [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=91GUCL69DpMC&amp;pg=PA197&amp;lpg=PA197&amp;dq=Ikribus+prayers&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=aLdwsBOCbz&amp;sig=LRAV5i1OcF4IvuSZZM0jRbeW1-c&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=SAtaVY-pOavV7QaLp4HgCg&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Ikribus%20prayers&amp;f=false Divination in Ancient Israel and its Near Eastern Environment: A Socio-Historical Investigation (footnote 5 - page 197)] A&amp;C Black, 1 May 1994 {{ISBN|0567059634}} (367 pages) ''The Library of Hebrew Bible/Old Testament Studies'' [Retrieved 2015-05-18]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another source shows ''ikribū'' were  benedictions.&lt;ref name="G.W. Bromiley"/&gt;

===Royal===
The rulers' (Kings of Babylonia) prayers were made to a variety of [[deities]], for example [[Marduk]] (the god of Babylonia), [[Nabu|Nabû]], [[Shamash|Ŝamaš]]. The kings had inscribed prayers made onto cylinders made of clay and kept within buildings, in order to fulfill this function. Prayers of this type tended to not be for reason of the seeking of mercy and salvation as is found in ''Šuila'' prayers.&lt;ref&gt;T Oshima - [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HQZM5Q3eKAQC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;dq=Royal+prayers+Babylonia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=tQxaVeDtOOyU7QbV2YPoDQ&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Royal%20prayers%20Babylonia&amp;f=false Babylonian Prayers to Marduk (p.21-22)] Mohr Siebeck, 2011 {{ISBN|3161508319}} (483 pages) ''Volume 7 of Orientalische Religionen in der Antike'', ISSN 1869-0513 [Retrieved 2015-05-18]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hymns===
By study of the prayers, it seems apparent to scholars, that these types of prayers seem to be reformations of earlier [[Literary topos|topos]] made, for example, in a similar vein to prayers such as the ''Prayer to the Gods of the Night''.&lt;ref name="G.W. Bromiley"/&gt;

===Šigû===
Šigû are lamentations. Lamentations are either [[wikt:complaint|complaints]], or expressions of [[grief]] or [[Sorrow (emotion)|sorrow]]. Both meanings are related (combined) within šigû.&lt;ref&gt;Google - [https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;rlz=1C1AVNA_enGB589GB590&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=lament search return] published by [[Google]] 22:40 hrs 12-12-2015  [Retrieved 2015-12-12]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Namburbi===
Prayers of this classification were performed during [[Namburbi|namburbi rituals]]. These rituals were undertaken firstly if an [[omen]] announced a [[fate]] that was [[evil]], and a person wished to counter-act the fate, and secondly to counter [[witchcraft]].&lt;ref name="Review (2012) by [[Journal of Hebrew Scriptures]] (designation DOI:10.5508/jhs.2012.v12.r17)  of"/&gt;&lt;ref name="C.O.

'''Multiconfessionalism''' is a term applied to countries which have a power sharing arrangement between people of different faiths, usually three or more significant confessional groups within the same jurisdiction. Examples of modern countries deemed multiconfessional are [[Religion in Lebanon|Lebanon]]{{sfn|Dawahare|1998}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sjur Bergan|author2=Hilligje van't Land|title=Speaking Across Borders: The Role of Higher Education in Furthering Intercultural Dialogue|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cSq7GN3ZwGQC&amp;pg=PA167|year=2010|publisher=Council of Europe|isbn=978-92-871-6941-9|pages=167–}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Religion in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia and Herzegovina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mary McIntosh|author2=Dan Abele|author3=University of Strathclyde.

'''Multiple religious belonging''' refers to the idea that individuals can belong to more than one religious tradition. While this is often seen as a common reality in regions such as [[Asia]] with its many religions, religious scholars have begun to discuss multiple religion belonging with respect to religious traditions such as [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]].{{sfnm |1a1=Cornille |1y=2002 |2a1=Phan |2y=2003}}

In some religions such as [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]], those who hold to an [[exclusivism|exclusivist]] understanding of religion see multiple religious belonging as problematic. This is in contrast with countries such as [[China]], [[Japan]], [[Korea]], [[Vietnam]], [[India]], [[Nepal]] and [[Sri Lanka]], whose cultures have a long history of being influenced by different religions.{{sfn|Phan|2003|p=498}} Moreover, in the [[Postmodernity|postmodern]] period people tend to question their identity, because of the unlimited choices of religions, which leads to the difficulty in defining their identity.{{sfn|Aylesworth|2015}}

Van Bragt showed that 79% of Japanese self-identify as [[Shintoist]]s and 75% self-identify as [[Buddhism|Buddhists]]. The reason for the extremely high percentage of both religions is that many Japanese consider themselves as both a Shintoist and a Buddhist and do not consider it a problem to belong to more than one religion.{{sfn|Van Bragt|2002|p=8}} (Whether this statistic is correct is arguable.{{efn|According to Mark R. Mullins's figures, there are only 30–33% of Japanese consider themselves as having "personal faith", while others usually see themselves as "without religion" (''mushukyo'').{{sfn|Mullins|2011}} For further discussions, see {{harvnb|Mullins|2011|pp=197–198}}.}}) This phenomenon, according to Van Bragt, is a "[[division of labour]]". Van Bragt argued that the cause of this phenomenon is that, different from the Western concept of religion, Shintoism and Buddhism in Japan are defined by their rituals and practices, not by their moral and social authority.{{efn|According to Van Bragt, while Buddhism and Shintoism govern the rituals and practices of Japanese, Confucianism is regarded as the authority for morality and the source of principles of social life.{{sfn|Van Bragt|2002|p=9}}}} Thus, the Japanese can belong to several religions that do not conflict with each other in terms of social and ethical issues.

Scholars such as [[Catherine Cornille]], [[Peter C. Phan]], [[Francis Xavier Clooney]], [[Jan Van Bragt]], [[Aloysius Pieris]] and [[Devaka Premawardhana]] have questioned the possibility of defining oneself into multiple religions. For these scholars, "religious belonging" is not an individual's subjective sense of a particular religion but rather, in Cornille's words, "the recognition of one's religious identity by the tradition itself and the disposition to submit to the conditions for membership as delineated by that tradition."{{sfn|Cornille|2002|p=4}} For Cornille, the ultimate purpose of a scholarly discussion on multiple religious belonging is to transform one's religion through the understanding of other religions.{{sfn|Cornille|2002|p=5}}

== Types of approaches ==
Based on Van Bragt's study, scholars have tried to investigate the possibility for adherents of a religion such as Christianity to belong to multiple religions. The approach to Christian multiple religious belonging, according to Devaka Premawardhana, can be divided into two trends: [[Peter C. Phan|Peter Phan]]'s approach based on a Christological ground, in which he emphasises on Christ's "asymmetrically superior status", and [[Francis Xavier Clooney|Francis Clooney]]'s approach rooted in a methodological ground, which tries to cross boundaries into another religion just as religions must have discrete entities.{{sfn|Premawardhana|2011|p=77}}{{Elucidate|date=December 2017|reason=What does 'just as religions must have discrete entities' mean? Please clarify this sentence.}} These two approaches are summarised below.

=== Christological approach ===
Phan's approach emphasised the assymmetricality in which [[Jesus]] is the [[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]] made flesh and the climax of God dealing with humankind.{{sfn|Phan|2003|p=503}} In an attempt to resonate with one's cultural identity and tradition, Phan explained that multiple religious belonging is necessary in order for practitioners of multiple belonging to treat other religions as a qualifier of their identity. This approach, according to Phan, does not deny one's Christian identity, which functions as substantive in relation to non-Christian religion.{{sfn|Phan|2003|pp=509–510}} Phan noted that multiple religious belonging is not a new issue in the twenty-first century but rather the common form of life of the first-century Christians recorded in the book of [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]]. In Phan's view, the disappearance of this trend was "a tragic loss to both [[Judaism]] and Christianity", because it led to a subsequent history of bitter hatred, especially from the side of Christianity.{{sfn|Phan|2003|pp=504–505}}

=== Methodological approach ===
As a [[Comparative theology|comparative theologian]], Clooney writes about the diversity in the world nowadays, especially with respect to the flourishing of different religions. For Clooney, reflecting on one's religion in this [[Pluralism (philosophy)|pluralistic]] world is necessary, so that we can "see the others in light of our own, and our own in light of the other."{{sfn|Clooney|2010|p=13}} Focusing on the study of scriptural and theological texts, Clooney compares them between Christian traditions and non-Christian religions, to "cross boundaries" to other traditions, so that one would re-think his or her theology, which would thus shape his or her identity.{{sfn|Clooney|2004}} After more than 40 years of studying Hinduism, Clooney concluded that he finds the distinctive disciplines of theology and Hinduism are "mutually enriching".{{sfn|Clooney|2010|pp=16–17}} By applying this approach, according to Clooney, one can start within his or her "home" tradition, enter a different tradition and return to his or her tradition, which is enriched and reformulated after crossing boundaries.{{sfn|Premawardhana|2011|pp=87–88}}

== Challenges and controversy ==
While scholars studying multiple religious belonging attempt to appreciate other religions' traditions besides their own, the conservative segment of Christianity tends to question the [[Inclusivism|inclusivistic]] view of multiple religious belonging because it implies that salvation can be found from somewhere else other than Jesus Christ.{{sfn|Kärkkäinen|2010}}{{efn|For definitions of traditional typology such as exclusivism and inclusivism, see {{harvnb|Migliore|2004|pp=306–307}}.}} In a 2010 article, [[Veli-Matti Kärkkäinen]], a systematic theologian, questioned the approach of "othering" those that have traditions different from Christians' because God is the one who offers salvation; Christians only witness it. It is out of humility that Christians can say that salvation belongs to God, and God only, in Kärkkäinen's view.{{sfn|Kärkkäinen|2010}} On the other hand, scholars studying multiple religious belonging such as [[John B. Cobb]] see this as an opportunity rather than a threat: "I do not see multiple religious belonging as the primary way into the future. The primary way is the transformation of the particular religious traditions, at least in the Christian case, through their new encounter with other traditions." For Cobb, engaging in [[interfaith dialogue]] helps smooth the tension between Christianity and Judaism and avoid misunderstanding toward [[Islam]].{{sfn|Cobb|2002|p=27}}

In a 2017 article, sociologist Steve Bruce pointed out that most of the published writings in which multiple religious belonging is studied are purely conceptual and offer "only anecdotes to illustrate theoretical or classificatory discussions".{{sfn|Bruce|2017|p=606}} Bruce argued that the few attempts to gather empirical data on the phenomenon have conflated a variety of different attitudes that should not be given the label of "multiple religious belonging", attitudes such as: [[Universalism|universalistic]] re-interpretation of multiple religions, multiple religious association through family ties, multiple religious interest or sympathies, ancillary religious respect for a specific aspect of a religion, and secular equal respect for all religions.{{sfn|Bruce|2017|p=610–611}} Bruce argued that the term "multiple religious belonging" should be strictly confined to being "an observant 'member' of more than one religion (religion here meaning such high level abstractions as Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Sikhism, Buddhism etc)", and since most religions have strict requirements for and expectations of observant members, sociologists should expect multiple religious belonging, defined in this way, to be "remarkably rare".{{sfn|Bruce|2017|p=611}}

{{Ancient Roman religion}}
'''Numen''', pl. '''numina''',  is a [[Latin]] term for "[[divinity]]", or a "divine presence", "divine will." The Latin authors defined it as follows.&lt;ref name=lewisnumen&gt;For a more extensive account, refer to {{cite encyclopedia | author1=Charlton T. Lewis | author2=Charles Short | language=Latin | encyclopedia=A Latin Dictionary | title=numen | publisher=Perseus Digital Library | url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dnumen}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cicero]] writes of a "divine mind" (''divina mens''), a god "whose numen everything obeys," and a "divine power" (''vim divinam'') "which pervades the lives of men." It causes the motions and cries of birds during augury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Cicero | title=De Divinatione | at=I.119-120 | publisher=Loeb Classical Library; penelope.uchicago.edu | url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cicero/de_Divinatione/1*.html}} {{cite web | author=Marci Tulli Ciceronis | title=De divinatione Prior | language=Latin | at=I.119-120 | publisher=The Latin Library | url=http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/cicero/divinatione1.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Virgil]]'s recounting of the blinding of the one-eyed giant, [[Polyphemus]], from the Odyssey, in his [[Aeneid]], he has Odysseus and his men first "ask for the assistance of the great numina" (''magna precati numina'').&lt;ref&gt;3. 634.&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewing public opinion of [[Augustus]] on the day of his funeral, the historian [[Tacitus]] reports that some thought "no honor was left to the gods" when he "established the cult of himself" (''se ... coli vellet'') "with temples and the effigies of numina" (''effigie numinum'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=C. Cornelius Tacitus | title=Annales | at=1.10 | language=Latin | publisher=Perseus Digital Library | url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0077%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pliny the younger]] in a letter to Paternus raves about the "power," the "dignity," and "the majesty;" in short, the "''numen'' of history."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=C. Plinius Cæcilius Secundus | title=Letters | at=9.27.1 | publisher=Perseus Digital Library | language=Latin | url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0139%3Abook%3D9%3Aletter%3D27%3Asection%3D1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lucretius]] uses the expression ''numen mentis'',&lt;ref&gt;T. Lucretius Carus, ''De Natura rerum'', 3.144.&lt;/ref&gt; or "bidding of the mind,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author1=Lucretius |title=On the Nature of Things | author2=R. Allison, Translator | publisher=Arthur Humphries | location=London | year=1919}}&lt;/ref&gt; where "bidding" is ''numen'', not, however, the divine numen, unless the mind is to be considered divine, but as simply human will.&lt;ref name=lewisnumen/&gt;

Since the early 20th century, numen has sometimes been treated in the [[History of religions|history of religion]] as a [[animism|pre-animistic]] phase; that is, a belief system inherited from an earlier time. ''Numen'' is also used by [[sociologists]] to refer to the idea of magical power residing in an [[magical object|object]], particularly when writing about ideas in the western tradition. When used in this sense, ''numen'' is nearly synonymous with ''[[mana]]''. However, some authors reserve use of ''mana'' for ideas about [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] from [[Polynesia]] and southeast [[Asia]].

==Etymology==
Etymologically, the word means "a nod of the head", here referring to a [[deity]] as it were "nodding", or making its will or its presence known). According to [[H. J. Rose]]: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The literal meaning is simply "a nod", or more accurately, for it is a passive formation, "that which is produced by nodding", just as ''flamen'' is "that which is produced by blowing", ''i.e.'', a gust of wind. It came to mean "the product or expression of power" — not, be it noted, power itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rose|first=H. J.|title=Primitive Culture in Italy|year=1926|publisher=Methuen &amp; Co.|pages=44–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thus, ''numen'' (divinity) is not personified (although it can be a personal attribute) and should be distinguished from ''[[deus]]'' (god).&lt;ref name="Bailey"&gt;{{cite book| last=Bailey| first=Cyril |title=The Religion of Ancient Rome |year=1907|publisher=Archibald Constable &amp; Co Ltd| url =http://www.gutenberg.org/files/18564/18564-h/18564-h.htm}}, freely available from [[Project Gutenberg]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roman cults of the numina==
Numen was also used in the [[imperial cult (Ancient Rome)|imperial cult]] of ancient Rome, to refer to the [[Genius (mythology)#Imperial genii|guardian-spirit]], 'godhead' or divine power of a living emperor—in other words, a means of worshiping a living emperor without literally calling him a god.&lt;ref name="Bailey"/&gt;

The [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|cult]] of [[Augustus]] was promoted by [[Tiberius]], who dedicated the ''Ara Numinis Augusti''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fishwick|first=Duncan|title=''Genius'' and ''Numen''|journal = Harvard Theological Review|volume = 62| issue = 3| pages = 356–367| date = July 1969| doi=10.1017/s0017816000032405}} Reprinted in Fishwick, D. (1990).&lt;/ref&gt;
In this context, a distinction can be made between the terms ''numen'' and ''[[Genius (mythology)|genius]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fishwick|first=Duncan|title='Numina Augustorum|journal = The Classical Quarterly |series=New Series|volume = 20| issue = 1| pages = 191–197| date = May 1970| doi=10.1017/s0009838800044773}} Reprinted in Fishwick, D. (1990).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition as a pre-animistic phase of religion==
The expression ''Numen inest'' appears in [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'' (III, 296) and has been translated as 'There is a spirit here'.&lt;ref&gt;Ovid. Fasti. Translated by Frazer, James George. Loeb Classical Library Volume. Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press; London, William Heinemann Ltd. 1931.&lt;/ref&gt; Its interpretation, and in particular the exact sense of ''numen'' has been discussed extensively in the literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rose|first=Herbert Jennings|title=Nvmen inest: 'Animism' in Greek and Roman Religion|journal = Harvard Theological Review|volume = 28| issue = 4| pages = 237–257| date = October 1935| doi=10.1017/s0017816000023026}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The supposition that a ''numinous presence'' in the natural world supposed in the earliest layers of [[Ancient peoples of Italy|Italic]] religion, as it were an "[[animism|animistic]]" element left over in historical Roman religion and especially in the etymology of Latin theonyms, has often been popularly implied, but was criticised as "mostly a scholarly fiction" by McGeough (2004).&lt;ref&gt;Kevin McGeough ''The Romans: new perspectives'' 2004:179 "Numinous Forces and Other scholarly Inventions"; "Scholars may have to content themselves with nodes of meanings for the Italic gods rather than hard-and-fast definitions," observes Charles Robert Phillips III, in "A Note on Vergil's Aeneid 5, 744," ''Hermes'' '''104'''.2 (1976:247–249) p. 248, with recent bibliography; Gerhard Radke's classification of the forms and significances of these multifarious names in ''Die Götter Altitaliens'' (Münster, 1965) was criticized as "unwarranted precision" in the review by A. Drummond in ''The Classical Review'', New Series, '''21'''.2 (June 1971:239–241); the coupling and uncoupling of Latin and Italic [[cognomen|cognomina]] of the gods, creating the appearance of a multitude of deities, were classically dissected in Jesse Benedictus Carter, ''De Deorum Romanorum Cognominibus: Quaestiones Selectae'' (Leipzig, 1898).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Numina and specific religions==
The phrase "numen eris caeloque redux mirabere regna" appears on line 129 of the poem ''Metrum in Genesin'',&lt;ref name="KreuzPseudo-Hilary2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gottfried Kreuz|author2=Pseudo-Hilary|title=Pseudo-Hilarius Metrum in Genesin, Carmen de Evangelio: Einleitung, Text und Kommentar|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LaEXAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=9 April 2012|year=2006|publisher=Verlag der Österreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften|isbn=978-3-7001-3790-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; attributed to [[Hilary of Arles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pavlovskis|first=Zoja|title=The Pastoral World of Hilarius' "in Genesin"|journal = The Classical Journal|volume = 85| issue = 2| pages = 121–132| date = December 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Open Episcopal Church''' (OEC) is a liberal Christian denomination. It has bishops in England and Wales and clergy throughout the United Kingdom and internationally. It has over 29,000 members.&lt;ref name="Members"&gt;[http://www.openepiscopalchurch.org/organisation/organisation.html Members]&lt;/ref&gt;

The church was the first in Britain to ordain a woman as bishop and to perform religious wedding ceremonies for gay couples.

The OEC is a member of the [[International Council of Community Churches]], which in turn is a member of The [[World Council of Churches]] and [[Churches Uniting in Christ]].

==History==
=== Founding of the Society for Independent Christian Ministry ===
In 1994 Jonathan Blake, who had been a priest in the [[Church of England]] for over 12 years, effected a Deed of Relinquishment,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/33-34/91/section/3&lt;/ref&gt; severing his denominational ties. 

As an independent priest&lt;ref name="Independent"&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/have-dog-collar-will-travel-counselling-dance-workshops-conflict-resolution-arbitration-exorcism----jim-white-meets-the-countrys-first-freelance-vicar-1444165.html The Independent - on 'Country's first freelance vicar'.]&lt;/ref&gt; he offered sacramental ministry to all. In 1997 he wrote about these experiences in his book, ''For God's Sake Don't Go To Church''.&lt;ref name="For God's Sake Don't Go To Church"&gt;For God's Sake Don't Go To Church {{ISBN|0-85305-446-0}} Published by Arthur James.&lt;/ref&gt; The same year he nailed 95 theses&lt;ref name="95 Theses"&gt;[http://www.bishopjonathanblake.com/theses.htm 95 Theses]&lt;/ref&gt; to the door of [[Canterbury Cathedral]], for which he was arrested but not charged.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.christian-alternative.com/authors/archbishop-jonathan-blake]&lt;/ref&gt;

A lesbian from the north of England arranged to meet Blake after reading his book. She felt a call to the ministry but had been rebuffed by the church over her sexuality and was interested in independent ministry. Following the meeting Blake placed an advert in the ''[[Church Times]]'' inviting all those interested in such a ministry to a conference the following March. Over 100 people contacted him, among them Richard Palmer,&lt;ref name="Palmer"&gt;[http://www.lcc.cc/tlc/lxv1/europe1.htm Richard Palmer]&lt;/ref&gt; who had been consecrated as a bishop of the [[Liberal Catholic Church]] in 1997, but had resigned in April 1999. 

Blake wrote the Founding Principles&lt;ref name="The Founding Principles"&gt;[http://www.sicm.eu/736.html The Founding Principles]&lt;/ref&gt; of the Society for Independent Christian Ministry (SICM), which was inaugurated by a group of Christians reciting the [[Lord’s Prayer]] in the Sanctum of the Holy Circle Trust&lt;ref name="The Holy Circle Trust"&gt;The Holy Circle Trust. Charity Number 1066062&lt;/ref&gt; near [[Ryarsh]] in [[Kent]] at sunrise on 1 January 2000.

In February 2001, Blake conducted the first gay wedding blessing on Richard and Judy's prime time TV programme ''This Morning''.&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1170214.stm BBC News - Gay Wedding on Richard and Judy]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Founding of the Open Episcopal Church ===

By the time SICM met for the third time in Bournemouth, Palmer required those who had been ordained simply in Dartford to be ordained ''sub conditione'' at this gathering in a full rite of ordination. Blake realized that a new denomination had to be founded and set about writing the necessary canons.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

At [[Hazlewood Castle]], Michael Wilson&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;[http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/archive/2004/08/07/Lancashire+Archive/5825155.Rent_a_bishop_at_your_service Michael Wilson]&lt;/ref&gt; was consecrated a bishop by Palmer and Blake. The three bishops issued the "Hazlewood Declaration" on 10 November 2001, which facilitated the creation of the Open Episcopal Church. The church viewed itself as being in succession from the [[Old Catholic Church]], which had been established in England in 1908 by [[Arnold Mathew]] from See of Utrecht and continued through the [[Liberal Catholic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.openepiscopalchurch.org/about/about.html&lt;/ref&gt;

For the next year, the Society of Independent Christian Ministry and the Open Episcopal Church coexisted, but the differences between them made this untenable, and at Liverpool in October 2002 it was decided finally that thereafter they should separate, following  similar paths, and containing many of  the same people, but with two distinct approaches.

The first significant meeting of the College of Bishops of the Open Episcopal Church took place in London in July 2002, prior to the separation of the Open Episcopal Church and the Society for Independent Christian Ministry at Liverpool in October of that year.

[[Elizabeth Stuart (theologian)|Elizabeth Stuart]] was consecrated as a bishop at the Royal Holloway Chapel, the college chapel of the [[Royal Holloway, University of London|Royal Holloway and Bedford New College, the University of London, Egham]] in Surrey, in April 2003. This was the first consecration of a woman as an independent Catholic bishop in the UK. 

The first congress of the church was held at the [[All Saints Pastoral Centre]] in June 2004. The church's college of bishops met at Weston Manor in Oxfordshire in January 2005 and Wilson, an evangelical, resigned from the Church. The second congress was held at [[Whaley Hall]] at Whaley Bridge in mid 2005. In October, Roger Whatley&lt;ref name="Whatley"&gt;[http://www.churchtimes.co.uk/content.asp?id=75762 Roger Whatley]&lt;/ref&gt; was consecrated a bishop in the Chapel of the [[Ammerdown House, Kilmersdon|Ammerdown Conference Centre]].

===Development===
The church has had three archbishops: Richard Palmer, who left the church along with Roger Whatley after the allotted five-years of Palmer's tenure as archbishop ended; Elizabeth Stuart, who left the church in 2006 and was appointed the Archbishop of the Province of Great Britain and Ireland of the more traditionalist [[Liberal Catholic Church International]]; and Jonathan Blake, OEC's founder, who was the church's sole remaining bishop after Stuart left.

In 2008 the Open Episcopal Church became a member of the [[International Council of Community Churches]] and through them, a member of the [[World Council of Churches]] and [[Churches Uniting in Christ]].&lt;ref name="ICCCC"&gt;[http://www.icccnow.org/Europe/  ICCCC.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The church received national and international attention due to the wedding blessing Blake conducted for [[reality television]] figures [[Jade Goody]] and [[Jack Tweed]],&lt;ref name="Jade Goody's Wedding"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/celebritynews/4779170/Jade-Goodys-wedding-The-final-preparations.html Jade Goody's Wedding]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Daily Mail Wedding"&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1150757/Roof-stunt-archbishop-line-conduct-Jades-wedding.html Daily Mail - Goody's wedding]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Damian Thomspon's blog"&gt;[http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/damianthompson/8679611/Jade_Goody_Archbishop_Blake_and_the_strange_phenomenon_of_wandering_bishops Damian Thompson's blog]&lt;/ref&gt; through interviews broadcast after Jade Goody's  death,&lt;ref name="After death"&gt;[http://www.talktalk.co.uk/video/11383/news/Bishop-praises-Jade/#36029 Talk Talk News Interview]&lt;/ref&gt; through the prayer released before Jade Goody's funeral,&lt;ref name="Prayer"&gt;[https://www.mirror.co.uk/celebs/news/2009/04/03/jade-goody-s-funeral-what-the-star-planned-for-her-last-journey-115875-21249010 Prayer for Jade]&lt;/ref&gt; through Blake's response to [[Michael Parkinson]]'s criticism of Goody,&lt;ref name="Criticism of Jade"&gt;[http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/UK-News/Jade-Goody-Bishop-Jonathan-Blake-Hits-Back-At-Sir-Michael-Parkinsons-Criticism/Article/200904215258069 Sky News - criticism of Jade]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Telegraph - Criticism"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/celebritynews/jade-goody/5123450/Bishop-hits-back-at-Sir-Michael-Parkinson-comments-on-Jade-Goody.html Daily Telegraph - criticism of Jade]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Daily Mirror - criticism of Jade"&gt;[https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2009/04/08/jade-goody-s-wedding-bishop-defends-her-against-sir-michael-parkinson-s-criticism-115875-21263483 Daily Mirror - criticism of Jade]&lt;/ref&gt; through the launch of Post the Host (an outreach provision to distribute the consecrated Hosts by post),&lt;ref&gt;

Following Jade Goody's wedding, Christopher Woods, Chaplain and Director of Studies in Theology at Christ's College, Cambridge, called upon the Church of England to speak out against Blake and the OEC. The Church of England declined to comment.&lt;ref name="Woods"&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article5786676.ece Revd Woods criticism]&lt;/ref&gt;

The church consecrated the first woman as a bishop for Wales in 2007.&lt;ref name="Female Bishops"&gt;[http://pluralistspeaks.blogspot.co.uk/2011/04/then-there-were-four.html  Female Bishops.]&lt;/ref&gt; The bishop of Scotland, David Gillham, ordained Helen Hamilton at St Magnus Cathedral, Kirkwall, Orkney in 2010; Gillham later fell into dispute with the church and left.&lt;ref name="Pluralist"&gt;[http://pluralistspeaks.blogspot.co.uk/2011/07/more-on-oec.html  Pluralist.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Press Reader"&gt;[https://www.pressreader.com/uk/the-herald/20120402/282376921549061  Press Reader.]&lt;/ref&gt; Hamilton was subsequently consecrated as the first woman bishop for Scotland in June 2012.&lt;ref name="Sunday Herald"&gt;[http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/13060905.Nun_made_Scotland_s_first_bishop/  Sunday Herald.]&lt;/ref&gt; She made an episcopal visit to Londonderry.&lt;ref name="Londonderry"&gt;[http://www.londonderrysentinel.co.uk/news/bishop-helen-makes-first-visit-to-the-city-1-4269686  Londonderry.]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 the church consecrated a female bishop for Northumberland.&lt;ref name="Northumberland"&gt;[http://www.berwick-advertiser.co.uk/news/female-bishop-for-northumberland-1-2740373  Northumberland.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Blake contributed to the book ''A Strange Vocation: Independent Bishops Tell Their Stories'' in 2009,&lt;ref name="A strange Vocation - Independent bishops tell their stories"&gt;A strange Vocation - Independent bishops tell their stories {{ISBN|1-933993-75-8}} Published by Apocryphile Press&lt;/ref&gt; and contributed liturgical material to Geoffrey Duncan's anthology ''Courage to Love''&lt;ref name="Courage to Love"&gt;Courage to Love {{ISBN|0-8298-1468-X}} Published by The Pilgrim Press&lt;/ref&gt; and Leanne Tigert and Maren Tirabassi's compilation ''All Whom God Has Joined''.&lt;ref name="All Whom God has Joined"&gt;All Whom God has Joined {{ISBN|0-8298-1838-3}} Published by The Pilgrim Press&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 Blake's book ''That Old Devil Called God Again: The Scourge of Religion'' was published.&lt;ref name="Publisher"&gt;[http://www.christian-alternative.com/authors/archbishop-jonathan-blake Publisher.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The church has clerics from Anglican, Roman Catholic, Pentecostal, Lutheran and Franciscan backgrounds and has grown internationally into America, Egypt, Brazil and Thailand.&lt;ref name="International"&gt;[https://allsaintschiangmai.com/2013/06/  International.]&lt;/ref&gt; The church promotes its KITE Awards for young people making a positive difference in the community.&lt;ref name="KITE Awards"&gt;[http://www.openepiscopalchurch.org/organisation/kite.html  KITE Awards.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Norfolk Network"&gt;[http://www.openepiscopalchurch.org/pdf/NetworkNorwichKITEArticle.pdf  Norfolk Network.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Serious changes in the [[Albanian Orthodox Church|Albanian church]] occurred under the Arab rule, when the Catholicos Nerses I Bakur (688-704) attempted to convert to Chalcedonism, thus recognizing the spiritual authority of [[Constantinople]]. He was deposed by the Grand Duke of Albania Shero and other feudal lords who remained faithful to the Albanian church, and cursed at the national church cathedral. In the second half of the 10th century, the population of the left-bank Albania (Hereti) was included in the sphere of influence of the decision of the Chalcedon Council of the [[Georgian Orthodox Church|Georgian Church]], adopted in the 7th century and got a great impact of Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sgW_HEcULMYC&amp;pg=PA158&amp;lpg=PA158&amp;dq=catholicosate+albania#v=onepage&amp;q=catholicosate%20albania&amp;f=false|title=From the Gulf to Central Asia: Players in the New Great Game|last=Ehteshami|first=Anoushiravan|date=1994|publisher=University of Exeter Press|isbn=9780859894517|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the territories of [[Transcaucasia]] entered the [[Russian Empire]], the Albanian Catholicos of the church in 1813 by the decree of [[Nicholas I of Russia|Tsar Nicholas I]] passed into the status of the [[Metropolitan bishop|metropolite]] of the Albanian church.

Orthodoxy became wide spread in Azerbaijan at the beginning of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://multiculturalism.preslib.az/en_a4.html|title=Azerbaijani Multiculturalism|last=Huseynzadeh|first=Tunjay|website=multiculturalism.preslib.az|language=en|access-date=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lib.aliyev-heritage.org/en/7855792.html|title=Welcome to Heydar Aliyevs Heritage Research Center|website=lib.aliyev-heritage.org|access-date=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Orthodoxy in Azerbaijan nowadays ==
In 1815, the first Russian Orthodox church appeared in [[Baku]]. Later such churches were built in [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]], [[Goranboy (city)|Goranboy]] (Borisi-Russian village, 1842), [[Shamakhi|Shemakha]] (Alty-Aghadj village, 1834), [[Lankaran]] (Vel village, 1838), and [[Gadabay District|Gedabek]] (Slavyanka village, 1844).

There were 21 sectarian villages in Baku during 1868.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.azerbaijan.az/_GeneralInfo/_TraditionReligion/_traditionReligion_e.html|title=Azerbaijan - Religion In Azerbaijan|website=www.azerbaijan.az|access-date=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905, the Baku Diocese of the Russian Orthodox Church was established. During the Soviet era,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.upenn.edu/journals/jil/articles/volume33/issue2/BlittBoyd33U.Pa.J.Int'lL.363(2011).pdf|title=Religion in USSR|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the authorities repressed the priests of the Baku diocese, but in 1944 two churches were opened.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://myangle.net/en/angle/899-russian-orthodox-church-baku|title=Russian Orthodox Church in Baku|work=MyAngle|access-date=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, the Baku-Caspian Diocese of the Russian Orthodox Church was established. On March 22, 2011, the decision of the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church was changed to the Baku-Caspian diocese in Baku-Azerbaijan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mospat.ru/en/2010/12/25/news33364/|title=Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church takes decisions on external church activities {{!}} The Russian Orthodox Church|website=mospat.ru|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 there were six Christian Orthodox churches in the country. Five of them belong to the Russian Orthodox church (ROC): three of them are located in Baku one in Ganja and one in [[Khachmaz (city)|Khachmaz]].

Another temple belongs to the jurisdiction of the Georgian Orthodox Church - the church of [[Saint George|St. George]] in the village of Gakh-Inguila in the [[Qakh District|Qakh district]], where the [[Ingiloy people|Ingiloi]] Georgians&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://matiane.wordpress.com/2010/08/16/activity-of-russian-orthodox-church-among-the-muslim-natives-of-the-caucasus-in-imperial-russia/|title=ACTIVITY OF RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH AMONG THE MUSLIM NATIVES OF THE CAUCASUS IN IMPERIAL RUSSIA|date=2010-08-16|work=მატიანე|access-date=2018-05-31|language=ka-GE}}&lt;/ref&gt; live compactly (about 7,500 people).

In 2013, November, President [[Ilham Aliyev]] participated in the opening ceremony of Orthodox Religious and Cultural Center of Baku and Azerbaijan Eparchy. Firstly&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;/sup&gt; The President visited the [[Holy Myrrhbearers Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://theorthodoxchurch.info/blog/news/azerbaijani-president-attends-opening-of-orthodox-religious-and-cultural-center-of-baku-and-azerbaijan-eparchy/|title=Azerbaijani President attends opening of Orthodox Religious and Cultural Center of Baku and Azerbaijan Eparchy|date=2013-11-16|work=News {{!}} Orthodoxy Cognate PAGE|access-date=2018-05-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also the [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] Archangel’s Temple in the capital city Baku.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archangel-mikhail-baku.com/en/about-us/|title=About us – Church of St. Archangel Michael of Baku|website=archangel-mikhail-baku.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Albanian-Udin Christian community ==
In 2001, during his visit to Azerbaijan, Patriarch Alexe II met with representatives of the Udin community who expressed the desire of their people to join the ROC. However, this did not lead to any real results, and the community of Udin remained outside the church's nourishment.

In May 28, 2003, the Albanian-Udin Christian community was established in Azerbaijan. The Chairman of the community was Robert Mobilea. This was due to the restoration of the ancient Kish temple in [[Shaki, Azerbaijan|Shaki]] (according to legend, the foundation was laid by the apostle Eliseus). In 2006, the restoration of the second Udin temple, the church in the village of Nijgabalinsky district, was completed. Restoration works are also continued in the village of Gum of the Gakh region and the basilica in the village of Gyumriuk with the intention of restoration of the Albanian basilica which is related to the 5th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/ai113_folder/113_articles/113_udins_konanchev.html|title=Udins Today - Ancestors of the Caucasian Albanians|last=|first=|date=|website=www.azer.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the bishop of Baku and the Caspian Sea, Alexander (Ishchein), reported that Orthodox worship will be performed in Udin churches, and priests for them are trained in Russian religious schools. The Baku diocese of the Russian Orthodox Church took part in some solemn events, and even held baptisms, but there is no general progress on the involving of Udin into the ROC. Meanwhile, the Albanian-Udin Christian community exists in the form of a separate ethno-religious group with its own ideas about the "Udin Church", in which rituals are conducted not by canonical clergymen, but by the members of the community. In particular, the right to baptize was taken over by the Chairman of the AUHO Robert Mobilea and the self-styled "spiritual figure" Rafik Danakari.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.baku.ru/blg-list.php?id=103190|title=Baptism in Nij|last=|first=|date=|website=www.baku.ru|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7504">The '''political science of religion''' (also referred to as politicology of religion or politology of religion) is one of the youngest disciplines in the [[political science]]s that deals with a study of influence that [[religion]] has on [[politics]] and vice versa with a focus on the relationship between the subjects ([[Actor (policy debate)|actors]]) in politics in the narrow sense: [[government]], [[political parties]], [[pressure group]]s, and [[religious communities]]. It was established in the last decades of the twentieth century.

==Research areas==
The basic research areas of the political science of religion are:
* All aspects of [[religion|religious]] teachings and practices that have direct political contents and messages, such as religious understanding of government, [[Power (sociology)|power]], political [[authority]], [[State (polity)|state]], political organizing, [[war]], [[peace]], etc.;
* All aspects of religious behavior and practice that don’t have direct political contents and messages but do have direct political consequences, such as building of [[Religious architecture|religious edifices]], [[pilgrimage]]s, etc.;
* Attitudes and positions of political subjects in the narrow sense towards religion and religious communities, such as that of [[political party|political parties]] and pressure groups towards religion and religious communities;
* Everything within apparently completely [[secular]] public behavior with no religious motives that causes religious consequences, such as an economic [[monopoly]] achieved by a religious group within a multi-confessional society – it cannot but cause political consequences.

These fields of research are in constant development. The newest area of research in political science of religion is on the subject of religion and international relations.

==History==
The political science of religion or politology of religion was established as an [[academic discipline]] in 1993 at the Faculty of Political Science of the [[University of Belgrade]], [[Serbia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fpn.bg.ac.rs/eng/pages/p_id1/o_p.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100210043816/http://www.fpn.bg.ac.rs/eng/pages/p_id1/o_p.html |archivedate=2010-02-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The  founder of this discipline is Dr Miroljub Jevtic; http://www.fpn.bg.ac.rs/en/undergraduate-studies/political-department/third-year/ . In 2006, [[Georgetown University]] established the [[Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs]] as one of the first American university research centers devoted to issues surrounding the political science of religion.

The ''Politics and Religion Journal'' was founded by the Center for Study of Religion and Religious Tolerance in [[Belgrade, Serbia]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.politicsandreligionjournal.com/english/english.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081028171212/http://www.politicsandreligionjournal.com/english/english.htm |archivedate=2008-10-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its ''spiritus movens'' and [[editor in chief]] is [[Miroljub Jevtić]], professor at the Faculty of Political Science, University of Belgrade, Serbia. The journal ''Politics and Religion'', produced by Cambridge Journals, published its first volume in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayJournal?jid=RAP Politics and Religion]&lt;/ref&gt;

The political science of religion is studied at almost all universities and political science departments in the United States. The [[American Political Science Association]] has a religion and politics section.&lt;ref&gt;[https://connect.apsanet.org/s11/home/ “Religion and Politics”]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38581">The '''Ptolemaic cult of Alexander the Great''' was an [[imperial cult]] in [[ancient Egypt]] in the [[Hellenistic period]] (323–31 BC), promoted by the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]]. The core of the cult was the worship of the [[apotheosis|deified]] conqueror-king [[Alexander the Great]], which eventually formed the basis for the [[Hellenistic religion#Ruler cults|ruler cult]] of the Ptolemies themselves. The head priest of the cult was the chief priest in the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]], and years were dated after the incumbents ([[eponym]]ous priests).

== Background ==
Following the [[death of Alexander the Great]] in 323 BC, his [[Macedonian empire|empire]] fell apart in the [[wars of the Diadochi]] (his generals, the [[Diadochi]] or "Successors"). One of them, Ptolemy, son of Lagos, secured rule of Egypt and made it the base for his own imperial ambitions. To legitimize his rule as [[Ptolemy I Soter]] ({{reign|323|282}} BC), he relied, like the other Diadochi, not only on the [[right of conquest]], but also on the supposed legitimate succession of Alexander. Not only did Ptolemy I portray himself as Alexander's closest friend in his historical work, but in 321 BC, he seized his body while Alexander's funeral [[procession]] was on its way to Macedon from [[Babylon]], and brought it to the Egyptian capital at [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]]. This claim was particularly useful in Egypt, where Alexander had been greeted as liberator from the [[Achaemenid Empire]] (the so-called "[[Twenty-seventh Dynasty of Egypt|Twenty-seventh Dynasty]]") and had been enthroned as [[Pharaoh]] and son of the [[ancient Egyptian deities|deity]] [[Ammon-Ra]], receiving divine honours. During his stay in Egypt, Alexander had also laid the foundations for the city of [[Alexandria]], which became the main Greek colony and capital of the country.

In the new Ptolemaic Kingdom, the Hellenic element ([[ancient Macedonians|Macedonians]] and people from Greek [[polis|city-states]]), to which the Ptolemaic dynasty itself belonged, formed the ruling class which succeeded the native Egyptian Pharaohs. While [[sacred king]]ship had long been practised in Egypt and other eastern nations, it was almost unheard-of in the Greek world. Driven by his unprecedented conquests, in the last year of his life Alexander had demanded even from his Greek subjects to be treated as a living god (''[[apotheosis|apotheōsis]]''). This was accepted only reluctantly, and often rejected outright, by the Greek cities, but Alexander's prolific founding of cities alone secured for him a divine status there, since Greek cities traditionally rendered their founder ({{lang-gr|κτίστης|ktistēs}}) divine honours. When Ptolemy took over Egypt, he incorporated the heritage of Alexander into his own propaganda to support the claims of his own dynasty. As part of this effort, Alexander was elevated from a simple patron god of Alexandria to the status of a state god for the Greek populations of the entire Ptolemaic empire, even beyond the confines of Egypt.

== Alexander as the chief god of the Ptolemies ==
During the early Ptolemaic dynasty ({{circa|290 BC}}), Ptolemy I began the construction of the [[Tomb of Alexander the Great]] in Alexandria (the {{lang|grc|σῆμα}}, ''sēma'', ), and appointed a priest ({{lang|grc|ἱερεύς}}, ''hiereus'') to conduct religious rites there. This office quickly advanced to become the highest priesthood in the Ptolemaic Kingdom, its prominence underscored by its eponymous character, i.e., each [[regnal year]] was named after the incumbent priest, and documents, whether in [[Koine Greek]] or [[Egyptian language#Demotic and Coptic|Demotic Egyptian]], where dated after him. The first priest of Alexander was no less a figure than Ptolemy I's brother [[Menelaus (son of Lagus)|Menelaos]]. The tenure lasted one year, but under Ptolemy I, the priests apparently held the post for longer tenures, while under his successors, with few exceptions, the tenures were reduced to a single year.

Under [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]] ({{reign|282|246}} BC), Alexander's body was brought to the ''sēma'', and, in contrast to the usual Greek custom of [[cremation]], was entombed in a magnificent golden [[sarcophagus]], which was eventually replaced by a transparent glass coffin to display his preserved body. Not only did the presence of Alexander's body in the Ptolemaic capital enhance the dynasty's prestige, but it also became one of the main attractions and pilgrimage sites in the ancient Mediterranean. Even [[Roman emperors]] made the journey to Alexandria to visit the great conqueror's tomb. 

The Ptolemies assigned the deified Alexander a prominent place in the [[Greek pantheon]], associating him with the [[Twelve Olympians]] like [[Zeus]] and [[Apollo]]. Accordingly, in documents Alexander was referred to simply by his name, as the epithet ''theos'' ("god") was regarded as superfluous.

== The Ptolemies as temple-sharing gods ==
While Ptolemy I Soter founded the imperial cult of Alexander, his son and successor Ptolemy II completed its connection to the ruler cult around the reigning dynasty itself. The cult of the Ptolemies began in 283/2 BC, when the deceased parents of Ptolemy II were deified as the "Saviour Gods" (θεοὶ σωτῆρες, ''theoi sōtēres''). Statues of the deified couple were installed in the Temple of Alexander, and the priest of the Alexander cult took over the rites for the deified Ptolemies as well. With this gesture, the Ptolemies underlined the superior position of Alexander, and their own subordination to him as "temple-sharing gods" ({{lang|grc|σύνναοι θεοί}}, ''synnanoi theoi''). Alexander remained the main recipient of rituals and sacrifices, with the Ptolemies only partaking in them.

The elevation of Alexander over the Ptolemies, and their connection to him, was further deepened through the expansion of the cult. Thus in 269 BC, the female priestly office of "basket bearer" (''[[kanephoros|kanēphóros]]'') for the "Sibling Goddess" (''thea adelphos'') [[Arsinoe II]] was established, followed in 211 BC by the "prize-bearer" priestess (''athlophoros'') in honour of the "Benefactor Goddess" (''thea euergetis''), [[Berenice II of Egypt|Berenice II]], and in 199 BC by a priestess for the "Father-Loving Goddess" (''thea philopatōr''), [[Arsinoe III of Egypt|Arsinoe III]]. All these priesthoods were subordinate to the priest of Alexander.

[[Cleopatra III of Egypt|Cleopatra III]] added three further female priesthoods for her own personal cult as "Benefactor and Mother-Loving Goddess" (''thea euergetis philometōr''): the "sacred foal" (''hieros pōlos''), the "crown bearer" (''stephanēphoros''), and the "light bearer" (''phōsphoros'').

The concept of "temple-sharing gods" was underlined under [[Ptolemy IV Philopator]] ({{reign|221|204}} BC), who translated the remains of the Ptolemies and their consorts—unlike Alexander, they had been cremated and kept in urns—to the ''sēma''.

== Union of the priesthood to the royal title ==
Ptolemy, son of Castor, is the last priest of Alexander known by name, before the position was merged into the royal office. Since the priesthood of Alexander is first attested in the royal titulature in the second year of the joint reign of [[Ptolemy IX]] and [[Cleopatra III]] (116/115 BC), it is unclear whether the merge of the offices took place in the last two years of [[Ptolemy VII]]'s rule, or with the accession of his successors. It is possible that the merger was done at the initiative of Ptolemy IX, as part of an effort to emphasize his precedence over his co-ruling mother, Cleopatra III. As such, the office changed its role and character, from an eponymous priesthood to a propaganda tool: unlike the royal office, which was increasingly shared among siblings or other family members from the early 2nd century BC on, the priesthood of Alexander was indivisible. This must have appealed to Ptolemy IX, eager to set himself apart from his mother, who he hated and who had begun her own priestly cult around her own person.

This new role of the priesthood of Alexander can be traced in later reigns as well. In the first months of 112/111 BC, an ordinary citizen, Artemidorus, occupied the office. He was probably a partisan of Cleopatra III, who had succeeded to temporarily evict her son from Alexandria. As women could not occupy a supreme priesthood in the Greek world, she had to content herself with placing one of her supporters in the post, as a public sign of her new dominance. After Artemidorus, however, the name of Ptolemy IX was subsequently added in the papyrus, which means that he managed to return to Alexandria in the same year.

In 107 BC, Cleopatra III managed to expel Ptolemy IX for good from Alexandria, and raised her second son, [[Ptolemy X]], to the throne as her co-ruler and priest of Alexander. As the inter-dynastic rivalry continued, however, in 105 BC she finally decided to assume the priesthood herself, to underline her precedence. Cleopatra probably intended this arrangement to be permanent, but her blatant violation of Greek norms in assuming the priesthood must have damaged her image among the Greeks. The last years of her reign were taken up with her persistent conflict with Ptolemy IX, until she died in 101 BC, probably following an assassination attempt by Ptolemy IX, whereupon Ptolemy X became sole ruler. The priestly and royal offices remained united under Ptolemy X and his successors, although the priestly title was rarely mentioned in the papyri, as the loss of its eponymous character rendered it irrelevant for dating purposes.

==Concept and etymology==
{{See also|Religio}}
''Religion'' (from O.Fr. ''religion'' religious community, from L. ''religionem'' (nom. ''religio'') "respect for what is sacred, reverence for the gods, sense of right, moral obligation, sanctity",&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|religion}}&lt;/ref&gt; "obligation, the bond between man and the gods"&lt;ref&gt;''[[Shorter Oxford English Dictionary]]''&lt;/ref&gt;) is derived from the Latin ''[[Religio|religiō]]'', the ultimate origins of which are obscure. One possible interpretation traced to [[Cicero]], connects ''{{lang|la|lego}}'' read, i.e. ''re'' (again) with ''lego'' in the sense of choose, go over again or consider carefully. The definition of ''religio'' by [[Cicero]] is ''cultum deorum'', "the proper performance of rites in veneration of the gods."&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''De natura deorum'' II, 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Julius Caesar used ''religio'' to mean "obligation of an oath" when discussing captured soldiers making an oath to their captors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Caesar |first1=Julius |last2=Translated by |first2=W.A. McDevitte and W.S. Bohn |title=The Works of Julius Caesar: Parallel English and Latin |date=2007 |publisher=Forgotten Books |isbn=9781605063553 |pages=377–378 |chapter=Civil Wars – Book 1|quote= Sic terror oblatus a ducibus, crudelitas in supplicio, nova religio iurisiurandi spem praesentis deditionis sustulit mentesque militum convertit et rem ad pristinam belli rationem redegit." – (Latin); "Thus the terror raised by the generals, the cruelty and punishments, the new obligation of an oath, removed all hopes of surrender for the present, changed the soldiers' minds, and reduced matters to the former state of war."- (English)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder, used the term ''religio'' on elephants in that they venerate the sun and the moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Pliny the Elder |title=The Natural History |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D8%3Achapter%3D1 |publisher=Perseus – Tufts University |language=Book 8 Chapter 1|quote= maximum est elephans proximumque humanis sensibus, quippe intellectus illis sermonis patrii et imperiorum obedientia, officiorum quae didicere memoria, amoris et gloriae voluptas, immo vero, quae etiam in homine rara, probitas, prudentia, aequitas, religio quoque siderum solisque ac lunae veneratio." – (Latin); "The elephant is the largest of them all, and in intelligence approaches the nearest to man. It understands the language of its country, it obeys commands, and it remembers all the duties which it has been taught. It is sensible alike of the pleasures of love and glory, and, to a degree that is rare among men even, possesses notions of honesty, prudence, and equity; it has a religious respect also for the stars, and a veneration for the sun and the moon." – (English)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern scholars such as [[Tom Harpur]] and [[Joseph Campbell]] favor the derivation from ''{{lang|la|ligare}}'' bind, connect, probably from a prefixed ''{{lang|la|re-ligare}}'', i.e. ''re'' (again) + ''ligare'' or to reconnect, which was made prominent by [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]], following the interpretation given by [[Lactantius]] in ''Divinae institutiones'', IV, 28.&lt;ref&gt;In ''The Pagan Christ: Recovering the Lost Light.''

Betty Sue Flowers, New York, Anchor Books, 1991. {{ISBN|0-385-41886-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The medieval usage alternates with ''order'' in designating bonded communities like those of [[monastic orders]]: "we hear of the 'religion' of the [[Order of the Golden Fleece|Golden Fleece]], of a knight 'of the [[Order of Aviz|religion of Avys]]'".&lt;ref name="Huizinga Middle"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Huizinga |first1=Johan |title=The Waning of the Middle Ages |date=1924 |publisher=Penguin Books |page=86|title-link=The Autumn of the Middle Ages }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ancient Greece, the Greek term ''threskeia'' was loosely translated into Latin as ''religio'' in late antiquity. The term was sparsely used in classical Greece but became more frequently used in the writings of Josephus in the first century CE. It was used in mundane contexts and could mean multiple things from respectful fear to excessive or harmfully distracting practices of others; to cultic practices. It was often contrasted with the Greek word ''deisidaimonia'' which meant too much fear.&lt;ref name="threskeia greece"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Barton |first1=Carlin |last2=Boyarin |first2=Daniel |title=Imagine No Religion : How Modern Abstractions Hide Ancient Realities |date=2016 |publisher=Fordham University Press |isbn=9780823271207 |chapter=8.

The modern concept of religion, as an abstraction that entails distinct sets of beliefs or doctrines, is a recent invention in the English language since such usage began with texts from the 17th century due to the splitting of Christendom during the Protestant Reformation and globalization in the age of exploration which involved contact with numerous foreign cultures with non-European languages.&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Harrison |first1=Peter |title=The Territories of Science and Religion |date=2015 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0226184487}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Religion enlightenment"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harrison|first1=Peter|title='Religion' and the Religions in the English Enlightenment|date=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0521892933}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Roberts Jon" /&gt;

Jewish ideologies of Peace and Peacemaking|pages=86-87|quote=Yet despite its ingrained theological tradition, one must acknowledge that the Jewish people did not begin to think of Judaism as a religion until fairly recently. To be clear, the contemporary religious category popularly known as Judaism can be traced back to an ancient Jewish culture traditionally entailing certain fixed ideas about God. That culture also involved unique rites and behaviors related to the worship of God later to be construed as key elements of the Jewish faith. But these cultural effects did not constitute a religion in the formal sense of the word (Nongbri 2013, 46-50). They entailed no compulsory system of belief or regulatory ritual program by which to measure one's Jewish identity. To be a Jew was primarily a matter of national or ethnic identification, a function of being born into a family of Jewish descent or choosing to disavow one's own ancestral culture to become a Jew. By and large, it was not a matter of confession or creed (Satlow 2006, 1-19). It was not until the nineteenth century that Jewish thinkers began to conceive of their ancestral culture in systematized religious terms. Seeking entry into a European civil society dominated by Christian values, many Jews touched by the liberal values of the European Enlightenment undertook to interpret their Judaism in terms analogous to Christianity.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even in the 1st century CE, Josephus had used the Greek term ''ioudaismos'', which some translate as Judaism today, even though he used it as an ethnic term, not one linked to modern abstract concepts of religion as a set of beliefs.&lt;ref name=Nongbri /&gt; It was in the 19th century that Jews began to see their ancestral culture as a religion analogous to Christianity.&lt;ref name="Burns Jewish" /&gt; The Greek word ''threskeia'', which was used by Greek writers such as Herodotus and Josephus, is found in the New Testament. ''Threskeia'' is sometimes translated as religion in today's translations, however, the term was understood as worship well into the medieval period.&lt;ref name=Nongbri&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nongbri |first1=Brent |title=Before Religion: A History of a Modern Concept |date=2013 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0300154160}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Quran, the Arabic word ''[[Din (Arabic)|din]]'' is often translated as religion in modern translations, but up to the mid-1600s translators expressed ''din'' as law.&lt;ref name=Nongbri /&gt; 

The [[Sanskrit]] word [[dharma]], sometimes translated as religion, also means law. Throughout classical [[South Asia]], the [[Dharmaśāstra|study of law]] consisted of concepts such as [[Prāyaścitta|penance through piety]] and [[Ācāra|ceremonial as well as practical traditions]].

Though traditions, sacred texts, and practices have existed throughout time, most cultures did not align with western conceptions of religion since they did not separate everyday life from the sacred. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the terms Buddhism, Hinduism, Taoism, Confucianism, and [[world religions]] first entered the English language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Harrison |first1=Peter |title=The Territories of Science and Religion |date=2015|page=101 |quote=The first recorded use of "Boudhism" was 1801, followed by "Hindooism" (1829), "Taouism" (1838), and "Confucianism" (1862) (see figure 6).

This construction of "religions" was not merely the production of European translation terms, but the reification of systems of thought in a way strikingly divorced from their original cultural milieu. The original discovery of religions in different cultures was rooted in the assumption that each people had its own divine "revelation," or at least its own parallel to Christianity. In the same period, however, European and American explorers often suggested that specific African or Native American tribes lacked religion altogether.

The indigenous religions of the Americas and Africa were not represented.

(...) The name ''Hindu'' was first a geographical name, not a religious one, and it originated in the languages of Iran, not of India. (...) They referred to the non-Muslim majority, together with their culture, as 'Hindu'. (...) Since the people called Hindu differed from Muslims most notably in religion, the word came to have religious implications, and to denote a group of people who were identifiable by their Hindu religion.

According to the [[philologist]] [[Max Müller]] in the 19th century, the root of the English word religion, the [[Latin]] ''[[:wikt:religio|religio]]'', was originally used to mean only reverence for God or the gods, careful pondering of divine things, [[pietas|piety]] (which [[Cicero]] further derived to mean diligence).&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Müller]], ''Natural Religion'', p. 33, 1889&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3D%2340976 Lewis &amp; Short, ''A Latin Dictionary'']&lt;/ref&gt; [[Max Müller]] characterized many other cultures around the world, including Egypt, Persia, and India, as having a similar power structure at this point in history.

{{quote|The very attempt to define religion, to find some distinctive or possibly unique essence or set of qualities that distinguish the religious from the remainder of human life, is primarily a Western concern. The attempt is a natural consequence of the Western speculative, intellectualistic, and scientific disposition. It is also the product of the dominant Western religious mode, what is called the Judeo-Christian climate or, more accurately, the theistic inheritance from Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. The theistic form of belief in this tradition, even when downgraded culturally, is formative of the dichotomous Western view of religion. That is, the basic structure of theism is essentially a distinction between a transcendent deity and all else, between the creator and his creation, between God and man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=King |first=W.L. |date=2005 |article=Religion (First Edition) |editor-link=Mircea Eliade |editor-first=Mircea |editor-last=Eliade |title=The Encyclopedia of Religion |publisher=[[Gale (publisher)|MacMillan Reference US]] |edition=2nd |p=7692}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The anthropologist [[Clifford Geertz]] defined religion as a
{{quote|[…] system of symbols which acts to establish powerful, pervasive, and long-lasting moods and motivations in men by formulating conceptions of a general order of existence and clothing these conceptions with such an aura of factuality that the moods and motivations seem uniquely realistic."{{sfn|Geertz|1993|pp=87–125}}}}

Alluding perhaps to Tylor's "deeper motive", Geertz remarked that
{{quote|[…] we have very little idea of how, in empirical terms, this particular miracle is accomplished. We just know that it is done, annually, weekly, daily, for some people almost hourly; and we have an enormous ethnographic literature to demonstrate it.{{sfn|Geertz|1993|p=90}}}}

The theologian [[Antoine Vergote]] took the term supernatural simply to mean whatever transcends the powers of nature or human agency. He also emphasized the cultural reality of religion, which he defined as
{{quote|[…] the entirety of the linguistic expressions, emotions and, actions and signs that refer to a supernatural being or supernatural beings.&lt;ref name="vergote"&gt;Vergote, A. (1996) ''Religion, Belief and Unbelief. A Psychological Study'', Leuven University Press. (p. 16)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Peter Mandaville]] and [[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]] intended to get away from the modernist dualisms or dichotomous understandings of immanence/transcendence, spirituality/materialism, and sacredness/secularity. They define religion as
{{quote|[…] a relatively-bounded system of beliefs, symbols and practices that addresses the nature of existence, and in which communion with others and Otherness is ''lived'' as if it both takes in and spiritually transcends socially-grounded ontologies of time, space, embodiment and knowing.&lt;ref name="Paul James and Peter Mandaville 2010" /&gt;

According to the MacMillan Encyclopedia of Religions, there is an experiential aspect to religion which can be found in almost every culture:
{{quote|[…] almost every known culture [has] a depth dimension in cultural experiences […] toward some sort of ultimacy and transcendence that will provide norms and power for the rest of life. When more or less distinct patterns of behavior are built around this depth dimension in a culture, this structure constitutes religion in its historically recognizable form. Religion is the organization of life around the depth dimensions of experience—varied in form, completeness, and clarity in accordance with the environing culture.&lt;ref&gt;MacMillan Encyclopedia of religions, ''Religion'', p. 7695&lt;/ref&gt;}}

His contemporary [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] disagreed thoroughly, defining religion as "the Divine Spirit becoming conscious of Himself through the finite spirit."&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Müller]]. "Lectures on the origin and growth of religion."&lt;/ref&gt;

(1871) ''[https://archive.org/stream/primitiveculture1tylouoft#page/424/mode/2up Primitive Culture: Researches Into the Development of Mythology, Philosophy, Religion, Art, and Custom. Vol. 1]''. London: John Murray; (p. 424).&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that narrowing the definition to mean the belief in a supreme deity or judgment after death or [[idolatry]] and so on, would exclude many peoples from the category of religious, and thus "has the fault of identifying religion rather with particular developments than with the deeper motive which underlies them". He also argued that the belief in spiritual beings exists in all known societies.

In his book ''[[The Varieties of Religious Experience]]'', the psychologist [[William James]] defined religion as "the feelings, acts, and experiences of individual men in their solitude, so far as they apprehend themselves to stand in relation to whatever they may consider the divine".{{sfn|James|1902|p=31}} By the term divine James meant "any object that is god''like'', whether it be a concrete deity or not"{{sfn|James|1902|p=34}} to which the individual feels impelled to respond with solemnity and gravity.{{sfn|James|1902|p=38}}

The sociologist [[Émile Durkheim]], in his seminal book ''[[The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life]]'', defined religion as a "unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things".{{sfn|Durkheim|1915|p=}} By sacred things he meant things "set apart and forbidden—beliefs and practices which unite into one single moral community called a Church, all those who adhere to them". Sacred things are not, however, limited to gods or spirits.&lt;ref group=note&gt;That is how, according to Durkheim, Buddhism is a religion. "In default of gods, Buddhism admits the existence of sacred things, namely, the [[Four Noble Truths|four noble truths]] and the practices derived from them"{{harvnb|Durkheim|1915|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the contrary, a sacred thing can be "a rock, a tree, a spring, a pebble, a piece of wood, a house, in a word, anything can be sacred".{{sfn|Durkheim|1915|p=37}} Religious beliefs, myths, dogmas and legends are the representations that express the nature of these sacred things, and the virtues and powers which are attributed to them.{{sfn|Durkheim|1915|pp=40–41}}

Echoes of James' and Durkheim's definitions are to be found in the writings of, for example, [[Frederick Ferré]] who defined religion as "one's way of valuing most comprehensively and intensively".&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Ferré, F. (1967) ''Basic modern philosophy of religion''. Scribner, (p. 82).&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, for the theologian [[Paul Tillich]], faith is "the state of being ultimately concerned",&lt;ref name="Tillich, P. 1957 p.1"/&gt; which "is itself religion. Religion is the substance, the ground, and the depth of man's spiritual life."&lt;ref&gt;Tillich, P. (1959) ''Theology of Culture''. Oxford University Press; (p. 8).&lt;/ref&gt;

When religion is seen in terms of sacred, divine, intensive valuing, or ultimate concern, then it is possible to understand why scientific findings and philosophical criticisms (e.g., those made by [[Richard Dawkins]]) do not necessarily disturb its adherents.&lt;ref&gt;Pecorino, P.A. (2001) [http://www2.sunysuffolk.edu/pecorip/scccweb/etexts/phil_of_religion_text/CHAPTER_10_DEFINITION/The-Definition-of-Religion.htm ''Philosophy of Religion. Online Textbook''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130619213234/http://www2.sunysuffolk.edu/pecorip/scccweb/etexts/phil_of_religion_text/CHAPTER_10_DEFINITION/The-Definition-of-Religion.htm |date=19 June 2013 }}.

==Aspects==

===Beliefs===
{{Main|Religious beliefs}}
Traditionally, [[faith]], in addition to reason, has been considered a source of religious beliefs. The interplay between faith and reason, and their use as perceived support for religious beliefs, have been a subject of interest to philosophers and theologians.&lt;ref name="iep.utm.edu"/&gt;

====Mythology====
{{Main|Mythology}}
The word ''myth'' has several meanings.
# A traditional story of ostensibly historical events that serves to unfold part of the world view of a people or explain a practice, belief, or natural phenomenon;
# A person or thing having only an imaginary or unverifiable existence; or
# A metaphor for the spiritual potentiality in the human being.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Campbell, ''The Power of Myth'', p. 22 {{ISBN|0-385-24774-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient [[polytheism|polytheistic]] religions, such as those of [[Ancient Greece|Greece]], [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], and [[Scandinavia]], are usually categorized under the heading of [[mythology]]. Religions of pre-industrial peoples, or [[culture]]s in development, are similarly called myths in the [[anthropology of religion]]. The term myth can be used pejoratively by both religious and non-religious people. By defining another person's religious stories and beliefs as mythology, one implies that they are less real or true than one's own religious stories and beliefs. [[Joseph Campbell]] remarked, "Mythology is often thought of as ''other people's'' religions, and religion can be defined as mis-interpreted mythology."&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Campbell, ''Thou Art That: Transforming Religious Metaphor''. Ed. Eugene Kennedy. New World Library {{ISBN|1-57731-202-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In sociology, however, the term myth has a non-pejorative meaning. There, myth is defined as a story that is important for the group whether or not it is objectively or provably true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/myth|title=myth|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include the [[resurrection]] of their real-life founder [[Jesus]], which, to Christians, explains the means by which they are freed from sin, is symbolic of the power of life over death, and is also said to be a historical event. But from a mythological outlook, whether or not the event actually occurred is unimportant. Instead, the [[symbol]]ism of the death of an old life and the start of a new life is what is most significant. Religious believers may or may not accept such symbolic interpretations.

====Worldview====
Religions have [[sacred history|sacred histories]], [[narrative]]s, and  [[mythology|mythologies]] which may be preserved in sacred [[Religious text|scriptures]], and [[Religious symbol|symbols]] and [[holy places]], that aim to explain the [[meaning of life]], the [[creation myth|origin of life]], or the [[religious cosmology|Universe]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

===Practices===
{{Main|Religious behaviour|Cult (religious practice)}}
The practices of a religion may include [[ritual]]s, [[sermon]]s, commemoration or veneration (of a [[deity]], [[God (male deity)|gods]], or [[goddess]]es), [[sacrifice]]s, [[festival]]s, [[Banquet|feasts]], [[trance]]s, [[initiation]]s, [[funeral|funerary services]], [[matrimony|matrimonial services]], [[meditation]], [[prayer]], [[religious music]], [[religious art]], [[sacred dance]], [[Community service|public service]], or other aspects of human culture.&lt;ref name="OD"&gt;[http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/mythology Oxford Dictionaries] mythology, retrieved 9 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social organisation===
Religions have a societal basis, either as a living tradition which is carried by lay participants, or with an organized [[clergy]], and a definition of what constitutes adherence or membership.

==Academic study==
{{Main|Religious studies|Classifications of religious movements}}
A number of disciplines study the phenomenon of religion: [[theology]], [[comparative religion]], [[history of religion]], [[evolutionary origin of religions]], [[anthropology of religion]], [[psychology of religion]] (including [[neurotheology|neuroscience of religion]] and [[evolutionary psychology of religion]]), [[law and religion]], and [[sociology of religion]].

Daniel L. Pals mentions eight classical theories of religion, focusing on various aspects of religion: [[animism]] and [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], by [[Edward Burnett Tylor|E.B. Tylor]] and [[J.G. Frazer]]; the [[Psychoanalysis|psycho-analytic]] approach of [[Sigmund Freud]]; and further [[Emile Durkheim]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Max Weber]], [[Mircea Eliade]], [[E.E. Evans-Pritchard]], and [[Clifford Geertz]].{{sfn|Pals|2006}}

[[Michael Stausberg]] gives an overview of contemporary theories of religion, including [[Cognitive science of religion|cognitive]] and biological approaches.{{sfn|Stausberg|2009}}

===Theories===
{{Main|Theories of religion}}
[[Sociology of religion|Sociological]] and [[Anthropology of religion|anthropological]] theories of religion generally attempt to explain the [[origin of religion|origin]] and [[social function|function of religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Segal|2005|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; These theories define what they present as universal characteristics of [[religious belief]] and [[Religious behaviour|practice]].

====Origins and development====
[[File:Yazilikaya B 12erGruppe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The [[Yazılıkaya]] sanctuary in [[Turkey]], with the twelve gods of the underworld]]
The origin of religion is uncertain. There are a number of theories regarding the subsequent origins of religious practices.

According to [[anthropologists]] John Monaghan and Peter Just, "Many of the great world religions appear to have begun as revitalization movements of some sort, as the vision of a charismatic prophet fires the imaginations of people seeking a more comprehensive answer to their problems than they feel is provided by everyday beliefs. Charismatic individuals have emerged at many times and places in the world. It seems that the key to long-term success – and many movements come and go with little long-term effect – has relatively little to do with the prophets, who appear with surprising regularity, but more to do with the development of a group of supporters who are able to institutionalize the movement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Social &amp; Cultural Anthropology |edition= |last1=Monaghan |first1=John |last2=Just |first2=Peter |year=2000 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-285346-2 |page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[development of religion]] has taken different forms in different cultures. Some religions place an emphasis on belief, while others emphasize practice. Some religions focus on the subjective experience of the religious individual, while others consider the activities of the religious community to be most important. Some religions claim to be universal, believing their [[law]]s and [[cosmology]] to be binding for everyone, while others are intended to be practiced only by a closely defined or localized group. In many places religion has been associated with public institutions such as [[education]], [[hospital]]s, the [[family]], [[government]], and [[politics|political]] hierarchies.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite book |title=Social &amp; Cultural Anthropology |edition= |last1=Monaghan |first1=John |last2=Just |first2=Peter |year=2000 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-285346-2 |page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropologists John Monoghan and Peter Just state that, "it seems apparent that one thing religion or belief helps us do is deal with problems of human life that are significant, persistent, and intolerable. One important way in which religious beliefs accomplish this is by providing a set of ideas about how and why the world is put together that allows people to accommodate anxieties and deal with misfortune."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

====Cultural system====
While religion is difficult to define, one standard model of religion, used in [[religious studies]] courses, was proposed by [[Clifford Geertz]], who simply called it a "cultural system".&lt;ref&gt;Clifford Geertz, ''Religion as a Cultural System'', 1973&lt;/ref&gt; A critique of Geertz's model by [[Talal Asad]] categorized religion as "an [[anthropology|anthropological]] category".&lt;ref&gt;Talal Asad, ''The Construction of Religion as an Anthropological Category'', 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Niebuhr's (1894–1962) five-fold classification of the relationship between Christ and culture, however, indicates that religion and culture can be seen as two separate systems, though not without some interplay.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Niebuhr, ''Christ and Culture'' (San Francisco: Harper &amp; Row, 1951) as cited by Domenic Marbaniang, "The Gospel and Culture: Areas of Conflict, Consent, and Conversion", ''Journal of Contemporary Christian'' Vol. 6, No. 1 (Bangalore: CFCC, Aug 2014), {{ISSN|2231-5233}} pp. 9–10&lt;/ref&gt;

====Social constructionism====
{{Main|Theories about religions#Social constructionism|l1=Social constructionism}}
One modern academic theory of religion, [[social constructionism]], says that religion is a modern concept that suggests all [[spirituality|spiritual]] practice and [[worship]] follows a model similar to the [[Abrahamic religions]] as an orientation system that helps to interpret reality and define human beings.&lt;ref name="vergote 89"&gt;Vergote, Antoine, ''Religion, belief and unbelief: a psychological study'', Leuven University Press, 1997, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;  Among the main proponents of this theory of religion are Daniel Dubuisson, Timothy Fitzgerald,  Talal Asad, and Jason Ānanda Josephson. The social constructionists argue that religion is a modern concept that developed from Christianity and was then applied inappropriately to non-Western cultures.

====Cognitive science====
{{Main|Cognitive science of religion}}

Cognitive science of religion is the study of religious thought and behavior from the perspective of the cognitive and evolutionary sciences. The field employs methods and theories from a very broad range of disciplines, including: [[cognitive psychology]], [[evolutionary psychology]], [[cognitive anthropology]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[cognitive neuroscience]], [[neurobiology]], [[zoology]], and [[ethology]].  Scholars in this field seek to explain how human minds acquire, generate, and transmit religious thoughts, practices, and schemas by means of ordinary cognitive capacities.

Hallucinations and delusions related to religious content occurs in about 60% of people with [[schizophrenia]]. While this number varies across cultures, this had led to theories about a number of influential religious phenomenon and possible relation to psychotic disorders. A number of prophetic experiences are consistent with psychotic symptoms, although retrospective diagnoses are practically impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nicholson|first1=PT|title=Psychosis and paroxysmal visions in the lives of the founders of world religions.|journal=The Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences|volume=26|issue=1|date=2014|pages=E13–14|doi=10.1176/appi.neuropsych.12120412|pmid=24515692}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Murray|first1=ED|last2=Cunningham|first2=MG|last3=Price|first3=BH|title=The role of psychotic disorders in religious history considered.|journal=The Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences|volume=24|issue=4|date=2012|pages=410–426|doi=10.1176/appi.neuropsych.11090214|pmid=23224447}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weber|first1=SR|last2=Pargament|first2=KI|title=The role of religion and spirituality in mental health.|journal=Current Opinion in Psychiatry|date=September 2014|volume=27|issue=5|pages=358–363|doi=10.1097/YCO.0000000000000080|pmid=25046080}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schizophrenic episodes are also experienced by people who do not have belief in gods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reina|first1=Aaron|title=Faith Within Atheism|journal=Schizophrenia Bulletin|date=July 2014|volume=40|issue=4|pages=719–720|doi=10.1093/schbul/sbt076|pmid=23760918|pmc=4059423}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious content is also common in [[temporal lobe epilepsy]], and [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Favazza|first1=A|editor1-last=Sadock|editor1-first=B|editor2-last=Sadock|editor2-first=V|editor3-last=Ruiz|editor3-first=P|title=Kaplan and Sadocks Comprehensive Texbook of Psychiatry|publisher=Wolters Kluwer|edition=10th|chapter=Psychiatry and Spirituality}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Altschuler|first1=EL|title=Temporal lobe epilepsy in the preistly source of the Pentateuch|journal=South African Medical Journal|date=2004|volume=11|issue=94|page=870}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atheistic content is also found to be common with temporal lobe epilepsy.&lt;ref name="Heilman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heilman|first1=Kenneth M.|last2=Valenstein|first2=Edward |title=Clinical Neuropsychology|date=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|language=English|isbn=9780195384871|page=488|quote=Studies that claim to show no difference in emotional makeup between temporal lobe and other epileptic patients (Guerrant et. al., 1962; Stevens, 1966) have been reinterpreted (Blumer, 1975) to indicate that there is, in fact, a difference: those with temporal lobe epilepsy are more likely to have more serious forms of emotional disturbance. This typical personality of temporal lobe epileptic patient has been described in roughly similar terms over many years (Blumer &amp; Benson, 1975; Geschwind, 1975, 1977; Blumer, 1999; Devinsky &amp; Schachter, 2009). These patients are said to have a deepening of emotions; they ascribe great significance to commonplace events. This can be manifested as a tendency to take a cosmic view; hyperreligiosity (or intensely professed atheism) is said to be common.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparativism===
{{Main|Comparative religion}}
Comparative religion is the branch of the [[study of religions]] concerned with the systematic comparison of the doctrines and practices of the world's religions. In general the comparative study of religion yields a deeper understanding of the fundamental philosophical concerns of religion such as [[ethics]], [[metaphysics]], and the nature and form of [[salvation]]. Studying such material is meant to give one a richer and more sophisticated understanding of human beliefs and practices regarding the [[sacred]], [[numinous]], [[spirituality|spiritual]] and [[Divinity|divine]].&lt;ref&gt;"Human beings' relation to that which they regard as holy, sacred, spiritual, and divine" [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] (online, 2006), cited after {{cite web |url=http://www.religionfacts.com/religion/quotes.htm |title=Definitions of Religion |website=Religion facts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of comparative religion, a common geographical classification&lt;ref name="EB" /&gt; of the [[Major religious groups|main world religions]] includes [[Middle Eastern religions]] (including [[Zoroastrianism]] and [[Iranian religions]]), [[Indian religions]], [[East Asian religions]], African religions, American religions, Oceanic religions, and classical Hellenistic religions.&lt;ref name="EB"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/497215/classification-of-religions/38029/Normative Charles Joseph Adams, ''Classification of religions: geographical'', Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
{{Main||History of religions}}
[[File:Prevailing world religions map.png|thumb|upright=2.05|A map of [[List of religious populations|major denominations and religions of the world]]]]
In the 19th and 20th centuries, the academic practice of [[comparative religion]] divided religious belief into philosophically defined categories called world religions. Some academics [[Study of religion|studying the subject]] have divided religions into three broad categories:
# [[world religions]], a term which refers to [[Transculturation|transcultural]], [[international]] religions
# [[indigenous religions]], which refers to smaller, culture-specific or nation-specific religious groups; and
# [[new religious movements]], which refers to recently developed religions.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Graham (2000). ''Indigenous Religions: A Companion''. (Ed: Graham Harvey). London and New York: Cassell. p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some recent scholarship has argued that not all types of religion are necessarily separated by mutually exclusive philosophies, and furthermore that the utility of ascribing a practice to a certain philosophy, or even calling a given practice religious, rather than cultural, political, or social in nature, is limited.&lt;ref name="pennington"&gt;Brian Kemble Pennington ''Was Hinduism Invented?'' New York: Oxford University Press US, 2005. {{ISBN|0-19-516655-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Russell T. McCutcheon. ''Critics Not Caretakers: Redescribing the Public Study of Religion''. Albany: SUNY Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Lash. ''The beginning and the end of 'religion'.'' Cambridge University Press, 1996. {{ISBN|0-521-56635-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current state of psychological study about the nature of religiousness suggests that it is better to refer to religion as a largely invariant phenomenon that should be distinguished from cultural norms (i.e. religions).&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Bulbulia. "Are There Any Religions? An Evolutionary Explanation." ''Method &amp; Theory in the Study of Religion'' 17.2 (2005), pp. 71–100&lt;/ref&gt;

===Morphological classification===
Some scholars classify religions as either ''[[Universalizing religion|universal religions]]'' that seek worldwide acceptance and actively look for new converts, or ''[[ethnic religion]]s'' that are identified with a particular ethnic group and do not seek converts.&lt;ref name="Hinnells"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Routledge companion to the study of religion |last=Hinnells |first=John R. |year=2005 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-33311-5 |pages=439–440 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=IGspjXKxIf8C |accessdate=17 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others reject the distinction, pointing out that all religious practices, whatever their philosophical origin, are ethnic because they come from a particular culture.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Fitzgerald. ''The Ideology of Religious Studies''. New York: Oxford University Press US, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Craig R. Prentiss. ''Religion and the Creation of Race and Ethnicity''. New York: NYU Press, 2003. {{ISBN|0-8147-6701-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tomoko Masuzawa.

===Demographical classification===
{{Main|Major religious groups|List of religious populations}}
The five largest religious groups by world population, estimated to account for 5.8 billion people and 84% of the population, are Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism (with the relative numbers for Buddhism and Hinduism dependent on the extent of [[syncretism]]) and traditional folk religion.

==Specific religions==
{{Mainarticle|List of religions and spiritual traditions}}

===Abrahamic===
[[File:Molnár Ábrahám kiköltözése 1850.jpg|upright|thumb|The patriarch [[Abraham]] (by [[József Molnár (painter)|József Molnár]])]]
[[Abrahamic religions]] are [[monotheistic]] religions which believe they descend from [[Abraham]].

====Judaism====
[[File:Open Torah and pointer.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Torah]] is the primary sacred text of Judaism.]]
[[Judaism]] is the oldest Abrahamic religion, originating in the people of [[History of ancient Israel and Judah|ancient Israel and Judea]]. The [[Torah]] is its foundational text, and is part of the larger text known as the [[Tanakh]] or [[Hebrew Bible]]. It is supplemented by oral tradition, set down in written form in later texts such as the [[Midrash]] and the [[Talmud]]. Judaism includes a wide corpus of texts, practices, theological positions, and forms of organization. Within Judaism there are a variety of movements, most of which emerged from [[Rabbinic Judaism]], which holds that God revealed his laws and [[613 Mitzvot|commandments]] to [[Moses]] on [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]] in the form of both the [[Torah|Written]] and [[Oral Torah]]; historically, this assertion was challenged by various groups. The [[Jewish people]] were scattered after the destruction of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] in 70 CE. Today there are about 13 million Jews, about 40 per cent living in Israel and 40 per cent in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs.gov.il/shnaton61/st02_27.pdf |title=Info |website=www.cbs.gov.il |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest [[Jewish religious movements]] are [[Orthodox Judaism]] ([[Haredi Judaism]] and [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]]), [[Conservative Judaism]] and [[Reform Judaism]].

====Christianity====
[[File:StJohnsAshfield StainedGlass GoodShepherd Portrait cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jesus]] is the central figure of Christianity.]]
[[Christianity]] is based on the life and teachings of [[Jesus of Nazareth]] (1st century) as presented in the [[New Testament]]. The Christian faith is essentially faith in Jesus as the [[Christ]], the [[Son of God]], and as [[Messiah|Savior]] and Lord. Almost all Christians believe in the [[Trinity]], which teaches the unity of [[God the Father|Father]], [[God the Son|Son]] (Jesus Christ), and [[Holy Spirit]] as three persons in [[monotheism|one Godhead]]. Most Christians can describe their faith with the [[Nicene Creed]]. As the religion of [[Byzantine Empire]] in the first millennium and of [[Western Europe]] during the time of colonization, Christianity has been propagated throughout the world. The main divisions of Christianity are, according to the number of adherents:
* The [[Catholic Church]], led by the [[Bishop of Rome]] and the bishops worldwide in communion with him, is a [[Communion (Christian)|communion]] of 24 Churches ''[[sui iuris]]'', including the [[Latin Church]] and 23 [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Catholic churches]], such as the [[Maronite]] Catholic Church.
* [[Eastern Christianity]], which include [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy]], and the [[Church of the East]].
* [[Protestantism]], separated from the Catholic Church in the 16th-century [[Protestant Reformation]] and is split into thousands of [[Religious denomination|denominations]].  Major branches of Protestantism include [[Anglicanism]], [[Baptists]], [[Calvinism]], [[Lutheranism]], and [[Methodism]], though each of these contain many different denominations or groups.

There are also smaller groups, including:
* [[Restorationism]], the belief that Christianity should be restored (as opposed to reformed) along the lines of what is known about the [[Apostolic Age|apostolic early church]].
* [[Latter Day Saint movement]], founded by [[Joseph Smith]] in the late 1820s.
* [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], founded in the late 1870s by [[Charles Taze Russell]].

====Islam====
[[File:Kaaba mirror edit jj.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Muslim]]s [[Tawaf|circumambulating]] the [[Kaaba]], the most sacred site in [[Islam]]]]
[[Islam]] is based on the [[Quran]], one of the [[Islamic holy books|holy books]] considered by Muslims to be [[Wahy|revealed]] by [[God in Islam|God]], and on the [[Hadith|teachings (hadith)]] of the [[Prophets of Islam|Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]], a major political and religious figure of the 7th century CE. Islam is based on the unity of all religious philosophies and accepts all of the [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]] prophets of Judaism, Christianity and other Abrahamic religions before [[Muhammad]]. It is the most widely practiced religion of [[Southeast Asia]], [[North Africa]], [[Western Asia]], and [[Central Asia]], while Muslim-majority countries also exist in parts of [[South Asia]], [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], and [[Southeast Europe]]. There are also several [[Islamic republic]]s, including [[Iran]], [[Pakistan]], [[Mauritania]], and [[Afghanistan]].
* [[Sunni Islam]] is the largest denomination within Islam and follows the Quran, the hadiths which record the [[sunnah]], whilst placing emphasis on the [[sahabah]].
* [[Shia Islam]] is the second largest denomination of Islam and its adherents believe that [[Ali]] succeeded Muhammad and further places emphasis on Muhammad's family.
* [[Ahmadiyya]] adherents believe that the awaited Imam [[Mahdi]] and the Promised Messiah has arrived, believed to be [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]] by Ahmadis.
* There are also Muslim revivalist movements such as [[Muwahhidism]] and [[Salafism]].

Other denominations of Islam include [[Nation of Islam]], [[Ibadi]], [[Sufism]], [[Quranism]], [[Mahdavia]], and [[non-denominational Muslims]]. [[Wahhabism]] is the dominant Muslim [[Maddhab|schools of thought]] in the [[Kingdom of Saudi Arabia]].

====Other====
The [[Bahá'í Faith]] is an Abrahamic religion founded in 19th-century Iran and since then has spread worldwide. It teaches unity of all religious philosophies and accepts all of the prophets of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam as well as additional prophets including its founder [[Bahá'u'lláh]]. One of its divisions is the [[Orthodox Bahá'í Faith]].

Smaller regional Abrahamic groups also exist, including [[Samaritanism]] (primarily in Israel and the West Bank), the [[Rastafari movement]] (primarily in Jamaica), and [[Druze]] (primarily in Syria and Lebanon).

===East Asian===
{{Main|East Asian religions}}
East Asian religions (also known as Far Eastern religions or Taoic religions) consist of several religions of East Asia which make use of the concept of Tao (in Chinese) or Dō (in Japanese or Korean). They include:

====Taoism and Confucianism====
* [[Taoism]] and [[Confucianism]], as well as Korean, Vietnamese, and Japanese religion influenced by Chinese thought.

====Chinese folk religion====
* [[Chinese folk religion]]: the indigenous religions of the [[Han Chinese]], or, by [[metonymy]], of all the populations of the [[Chinese cultural sphere]]. It includes the syncretism of [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]] and [[Buddhism]], [[Wuism]], as well as many new religious movements such as [[Chen Tao (True Way Cult)|Chen Tao]], [[Falun Gong]] and [[Yiguandao]].
* Other folk and new religions of [[East Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]] such as [[Korean shamanism]], [[Chondogyo]], and [[Jeung San Do]] in Korea; [[Shinto]], [[Shugendo]], [[Ryukyuan religion]], and [[Japanese new religions]] in Japan; [[Satsana Phi]] in Laos; [[Cao Đài]], [[Hòa Hảo]], and [[Vietnamese folk religion]] in Vietnam.

===Dharmic (Indian)===

[[File:Astasahasrika Prajnaparamita Dharmacakra Discourse.jpeg|thumb|upright|The [[Buddha]], in a [[Sanskrit]] manuscript, [[Nalanda|Nālandā]], Bihar, India]]
[[Indian religions]] are practiced or were founded in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. They are sometimes classified as the ''dharmic religions'', as they all feature [[dharma]], the specific law of reality and duties expected according to the religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mittal |first=Sushil |title=Surprising Bedfellows: Hindus and Muslims in Medieval and Early Modern India |year=2003 |publisher=Lexington Books |isbn=9780739106730 |page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hinduism====
* [[Hinduism]] is preferentially self-designated by the term ''Vaidika Dharma''.&lt;ref name="Klostermaier2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Klaus K. Klostermaier|title=Survey of Hinduism, A: Third Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8CVviRghVtIC|date=2010|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-8011-3| page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[synecdoche]] describing the similar philosophies of [[Vaishnavism]], [[Shaivism]], and [[Hindu denominations|related groups]] practiced or founded in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. Concepts most of them share in common include [[karma]], [[caste]], [[reincarnation]], [[mantra]]s, [[yantra]]s, and [[darśana]].&lt;ref group=note&gt;Hinduism is variously defined as a religion, set of religious beliefs and practices, religious tradition etc. For a discussion on the topic, see: "Establishing the boundaries" in Gavin Flood (2003), pp. 1–17. [[René Guénon]] in his'' [[Introduction to the Study of the Hindu doctrines]]'' (1921 ed.), Sophia Perennis, {{ISBN|0-900588-74-8}}, proposes a definition of the term religion and a discussion of its relevance (or lack of) to Hindu doctrines (part II, chapter 4, p. 58).&lt;/ref&gt; Hinduism is one of the most ancient of still-active religions,&lt;ref&gt;p. 434 ''Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of World Religions'' By Wendy Doniger, M. Webster, Merriam-Webster, Inc&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;p. 219 ''Faith, Religion &amp; Theology'' By Brennan Hill, Paul F. Knitter, William Madges&lt;/ref&gt; with origins perhaps as far back as prehistoric times.&lt;ref&gt;p. 6 ''The World's Great Religions'' By Yoshiaki Gurney Omura, Selwyn Gurney Champion, Dorothy Short&lt;/ref&gt; Hinduism is not a monolithic religion but a religious category containing dozens of separate philosophies amalgamated as [[Sanātana Dharma]], which is the name by which Hinduism has been known throughout history by its followers.

====Jainism====
* [[Jainism]], taught primarily by [[Rishabhanatha]] (the founder of [[ahimsa]]) is an ancient Indian religion that prescribes a path of [[non-violence]], [[truth]] and [[anekantavada]] for all forms of living beings in this universe; which helps them to eliminate all the [[Karma in Jainism|Karmas]], and hence to attain freedom from the cycle of birth and death ([[Saṃsāra (Jainism)|saṃsāra]]), that is, achieving ([[Moksha (Jainism)|nirvana]]). Jains are found mostly in India. According to Dundas, outside of the Jain tradition, historians date the [[Mahavira]] as about contemporaneous with the [[Buddha]] in the 5th-century BCE, and accordingly the historical [[Parshvanatha]], based on the c. 250-year gap, is placed in 8th or 7th century BCE.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|pp=30–31}}
** [[Digambara]] Jainism (or sky-clad) is mainly practiced in South India. Their holy books are [[Pravachanasara]] and [[Samayasara]] written by their Prophets  [[Kundakunda]] and [[Amritchandra]] as their [[Jain Agamas (Digambara)|original cannon]] is lost.
** [[Shwetambara]] Jainism (or white-clad) is mainly practiced in Western India. Their holy books are [[Jain Agamas]], written by their Prophet [[Sthulibhadra]].

====Buddhism====
* [[Buddhism]] was founded by [[Gautama Buddha|Siddhartha Gautama]] in the 6th century BCE. Buddhists generally agree that Gotama aimed to help [[Sentient beings (Buddhism)|sentient beings]] end their [[dukkha|suffering (dukkha)]] by understanding the [[dharma|true nature of phenomena]], thereby escaping the cycle of suffering and rebirth ([[Saṃsāra (Buddhism)|saṃsāra]]), that is, achieving [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|nirvana]].
** [[Theravada]] Buddhism, which is practiced mainly in [[Sri Lanka]] and Southeast Asia alongside folk religion, shares some characteristics of Indian religions. It is based in a large collection of texts called the [[Pali Canon]].
** [[Mahayana]] Buddhism (or the Great Vehicle) under which are a multitude of doctrines that became prominent [[Buddhism in China|in China]] and are still relevant [[Buddhism in Vietnam|in Vietnam]], [[Buddhism in Korea|Korea]], [[Buddhism in Japan|Japan]] and to a lesser extent [[Buddhism in the West|in Europe and the United States]]. Mahayana Buddhism includes such disparate teachings as [[Zen]], [[Pure Land Buddhism|Pure Land]], and [[Soka Gakkai]].
** [[Vajrayana]] Buddhism first appeared in India in the 3rd century CE.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul; Tribe, Anthony (2000), Buddhist Thought: A complete introduction to the Indian tradition, Routledge, {{ISBN|0-203-18593-5}} p=194&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently most prominent in the Himalaya regions&lt;ref&gt;Smith, E.

The principal beliefs of Sikhi are faith in ''[[Waheguru]]''—represented by the phrase ''[[ik Onkar|ik ōaṅkār]]'', meaning one God, who prevails in everything, along with a [[praxis (process)|praxis]] in which the Sikh is enjoined to engage in social reform through the pursuit of justice for all human beings.

===Indigenous and folk===
[[File:Chinese temple incence burner.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Incense]] burner in China]]
[[Indigenous religions]] or [[ethnic religion|folk religions]] refers to a broad category of traditional religions that can be characterised by [[shamanism]], [[animism]] and [[ancestor worship]], where traditional means "indigenous, that which is aboriginal or foundational, handed down from generation to generation…".&lt;ref&gt;J.O.

===Law===
{{main|Law and religion}}
The study of law and religion is a relatively new field, with several thousand scholars involved in law schools, and academic departments including political science, religion, and history since 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Witte |first1=John |year=2012 |title=The Study of Law and Religion in the United States: An Interim Report |url= |journal=Ecclesiastical Law Journal |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=327–354 |doi=10.1017/s0956618x12000348}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars in the field are not only focused on strictly legal issues about religious freedom or non-establishment, but also study religions as they are qualified through judicial discourses or legal understanding of religious phenomena. Exponents look at canon law, natural law, and state law, often in a comparative perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Doe, ''Law and Religion in Europe: A Comparative Introduction'' (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W.

===Science===
{{Main|Faith and rationality|Relationship between religion and science|Epistemology}}
[[Science]] acknowledges [[reason]], [[empiricism]], and [[evidence]]; and religions include [[revelation]], [[faith]] and [[sacredness]] whilst also acknowledging [[Philosophy of religion|philosophical]] and [[metaphysical]] explanations with regard to the study of the universe. Both science and religion are not monolithic, timeless, or static because both are complex social and cultural endeavors that have changed through time across languages and cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stenmark |first1=Mikael |title=How to Relate Science and Religion: A Multidimensional Model |date=2004 |publisher=W.B. Eerdmans Pub. Co. |location=Grand Rapids, Mich. |isbn=978-0802828231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concepts of science and religion are a recent invention: the term religion emerged in the 17th century in the midst of colonization and globalization and the Protestant Reformation.&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Nongbri/&gt; The term science emerged in the 19th century out of [[natural philosophy]] in the midst of attempts to narrowly define those who studied nature ([[natural science]]),&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cahan Natural Philosophy"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Cahan|editor1-first=David|title=From Natural Philosophy to the Sciences: Writing the History of Nineteenth-Century Science|date=2003|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0226089287}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WSACM"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Numbers|editor1-first=Ronald|editor2-last=Lindberg|editor2-first=David|title=When Science and Christianity Meet|date=2003|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0226482149}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the phrase religion and science emerged in the 19th century due to the reification of both concepts.&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories"/&gt; It was in the 19th century that the terms Buddhism, Hinduism, Taoism, and Confucianism first emerged.&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories" /&gt; In the ancient and medieval world, the etymological Latin roots of both science (''scientia'') and religion (''religio'') were understood as inner qualities of the individual or virtues, never as doctrines, practices, or actual sources of knowledge.&lt;ref name="Harrison Territories" /&gt;

In general the [[scientific method]] gains knowledge by testing hypotheses to develop [[theories]] through elucidation of facts or evaluation by [[experiment]]s and thus only answers [[physical cosmology|cosmological]] questions about the [[universe]] that can be observed and measured. It develops [[theory|theories]] of the world which best fit physically observed evidence. All scientific knowledge is subject to later refinement, or even rejection, in the face of additional evidence. Scientific theories that have an overwhelming preponderance of favorable evidence are often treated as ''[[de facto]]'' verities in general parlance, such as the theories of [[general relativity]] and [[natural selection]] to explain respectively the mechanisms of [[gravity]] and [[evolution]].

Religion does not have a method per se partly because religions emerge through time from diverse cultures and it is an attempt to find meaning in the world, and to explain humanity's place in it and relationship to it and to any posited entities. In terms of Christian theology and ultimate truths, people rely on reason, experience, scripture, and tradition to test and gauge what they experience and what they should believe. Furthermore, religious models, understanding, and metaphors are also revisable, as are scientific models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Tolman |first1=Cynthia |title=Methods in Religion |url=http://akbar.marlboro.edu/~mahoney/vhs/SciRelCourse/Religion_methods.html |website=Malboro College |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904013431/http://akbar.marlboro.edu/~mahoney/vhs/SciRelCourse/Religion_methods.html |archivedate=4 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding religion and science, [[Albert Einstein]] states (1940): "For science can only ascertain what is, but not what should be, and outside of its domain value judgments of all kinds remain necessary. Religion, on the other hand, deals only with evaluations of human thought and action; it cannot justifiably speak of facts and relationships between facts…Now, even though the realms of religion and science in themselves are clearly marked off from each other, nevertheless there exist between the two strong reciprocal relationships and dependencies. Though religion may be that which determine the goals, it has, nevertheless, learned from science, in the broadest sense, what means will contribute to the attainment of the goals it has set up." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Personal God Concept Causes Science-Religion Conflict |journal=The Science News-Letter |date=21 September 1940 |first=Albert |last=Einstein |volume=38 |issue=12 |pages=181–182 |jstor=3916567 |doi=10.2307/3916567}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Morality ===
{{Main|Morality and religion}}
Many religions have value frameworks regarding personal behavior meant to guide adherents in determining between right and wrong. These include the [[Jainism#Core beliefs|Triple Jems of Jainism]], [[Judaism|Judaism's]] [[Halacha]], [[Islam|Islam's]] [[Sharia]], [[Catholicism|Catholicism's]] [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon Law]], [[Buddhism|Buddhism's]] [[Eightfold Path]], and [[Theological Aspects of the Avesta|Zoroastrianism's]] good thoughts, good words, and good deeds concept, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Good Without God: What a Billion Nonreligious People Do Believe|last=Esptein|first=Greg M.|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2010|isbn=978-0-06-167011-4|edition=|location=New York|page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of religion and morality can be contentious due to ethnocentric views on morality, failure to distinguish between in group and out group altruism, and inconsistent definitions of religiosity.

=== Politics ===
====Impact====
Religion has had a significant impact on the political system in many countries. Notably, most Muslim-majority countries adopt various aspects of [[sharia]], the Islamic law. Some countries even define themselves in religious terms, such as [[Iran|The Islamic Republic of Iran]]. The sharia thus affects up to 23% of the global population, or 1.57&amp;nbsp;billion people who are [[Muslim world|Muslims]]. However, religion also affects political decisions in many western countries. For instance, in the [[United States]], 51% of voters would be less likely to vote for a presidential candidate who did not believe in God, and only 6% more likely.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2016/02/economist-explains-18?cid1=cust/noenew/n/n/n/20160229n/owned/n/n/nwl/n/n/NA/email The Economist explains: The role of religion in America’s presidential race], ''The Economist'', 25 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Christians make up 92% of members of the US Congress, compared with 71% of the general public (as of 2014). At the same time, while 23% of U.S. adults are religiously unaffiliated, only one member of Congress ([[Kyrsten Sinema]], D-Arizona), or 0.2% of that body, claims no religious affiliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/08/27/10-facts-about-religion-in-america/|title=10 facts about religion in America|last=Lipka|first=Michael|date=27 Aug 2015|website=|publisher=Pew Research Center|access-date=9 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most European countries, however, religion has a much smaller influence on politics&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/blogs/erasmus/2014/04/europe-religion-and-politics Europe, religion and politics:Old world wars], The Economist, 22 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt; although it used to be much more important. For instance, [[same-sex marriage]] and [[abortion]] were illegal in many European countries until recently, following Christian (usually [[Catholicism|Catholic]]) doctrine. Several [[List of atheists in politics and law|European leaders are atheists]] (e.g. [[France]]’s former president [[François Hollande|Francois Hollande]] or Greece's prime minister [[Alexis Tsipras]]). In Asia, the role of religion differs widely between countries. For instance, [[India]] is still one of the most religious countries and religion still has a strong impact on politics, given that Hindu nationalists have been targeting minorities like the Muslims and the Christians, who historically belonged to the lower castes.&lt;ref&gt;Lobo, L. 2000 [http://americamagazine.org/issue/276/article/religion-and-politics-india Religion and Politics in India], ''America Magazine'', 19 February 2000&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, countries such as [[Religion in China|China]] or [[Religion in Japan|Japan]] are largely secular and thus religion has a much smaller impact on politics.

====Secularism====
[[File:Ranjitsingh.gif|thumb|upright|[[Ranjit Singh]] established [[Ranjit Singh#Secular Sikh rule|secular rule]] over [[Punjab region|Punjab]] in the early 19th century.]]

{{Main|Secularism| Secularization}}
Secularization is the transformation of the politics of a society from close identification with a particular religion's values and institutions toward nonreligious values and [[secular]] institutions. The purpose of this is frequently modernization or protection of the populations religious diversity.

===Economics===
[[File:Religion economy.png|thumb|upright=1.8|Average income correlates negatively with (self-defined) religiosity.&lt;ref name="gia" /&gt;]]
{{Main|Economics of religion}}
{{Further|Religion and business|Wealth and religion}}
One study has found there is a negative correlation between self-defined religiosity and the wealth of nations.&lt;ref name=WIN-Gallup&gt;{{cite web |last=WIN-Gallup |title=Global Index of religion and atheism. |url=http://www.wingia.com/web/files/news/14/file/14.pdf |accessdate=12 July 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021065544/http://www.wingia.com/web/files/news/14/file/14.pdf |archivedate=21 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the richer a nation is, the less likely its inhabitants to call themselves religious, whatever this word means to them (Many people identify themselves as part of a religion (not irreligion) but do not self-identify as religious).&lt;ref name="WIN-Gallup" /&gt;

Sociologist and political economist [[Max Weber]] has argued that Protestant Christian countries are wealthier because of their [[Protestant work ethic]].&lt;ref&gt;Max Weber, [1904] 1920. ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a study from 2015, [[Christians]] hold the largest amount of wealth (55% of the total world wealth), followed by [[Muslims]] (5.8%), [[Hindus]] (3.3%) and [[Jewish]] (1.1%). According to the same study it was found that adherents under the classification [[Irreligion]] or other religions hold about 34.8% of the total global wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/453467/christians-hold-largest-percentage-global.html6 |title=Christians hold largest percentage of global wealth: Report|publisher=deccanherald.com|date=2015-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health===
{{Main|Impacts of religion on health}}
[[Mayo Clinic]] researchers examined the association between religious involvement and spirituality, and physical health, mental health, health-related quality of life, and other health outcomes. The authors reported that: "Most studies have shown that religious involvement and spirituality are associated with better health outcomes, including greater longevity, coping skills, and health-related quality of life (even during terminal illness) and less anxiety, depression, and suicide."&lt;ref name="Religion and Medicine"&gt;{{cite web |first1=Paul S. |last1=Mueller, MD |first2=David J. |last2=Plevak, MD |first3=Teresa A. |last3=Rummans, MD |title=Religious Involvement, Spirituality, and Medicine: Implications for Clinical Practice |url=http://download.journals.elsevierhealth.com/pdfs/journals/0025-6196/PIIS0025619611627997.pdf |quote=We reviewed published studies, meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and subject reviews that examined the association between religious involvement and spirituality and physical health, mental health, health-related quality of life, and other health outcomes.

Most studies have shown that religious involvement and spirituality are associated with better health outcomes, including greater longevity, coping skills, and health-related quality of life (even during terminal illness) and less anxiety, depression, and suicide |accessdate=13 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors of a subsequent study concluded that the influence of religion on health is largely beneficial, based on a review of related literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last2=Hill |first2=Peter C. |title=The Role of Religion and Spirituality in Mental and Physical Health |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |date=February 2001 |first=Kevin S. |last=Seybold |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=21–24 |doi=10.1111/1467-8721.00106}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to academic James W. Jones, several studies have discovered "positive correlations between religious belief and practice and mental and physical health and longevity." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Religion, Health, and the Psychology of Religion: How the Research on Religion and Health Helps Us Understand Religion |journal=Journal of Religion and Health |year=2004 |first=James W. |last=Jones |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=317–328 |doi=10.1007/s10943-004-4299-3|url=http://dergipark.gov.tr/bilimname/issue/3501/47580 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An analysis of data from the 1998 US General Social Survey, whilst broadly confirming that religious activity was associated with better health and well-being, also suggested that the role of different dimensions of spirituality/religiosity in health is rather more complicated. The results suggested "that it may not be appropriate to generalize findings about the relationship between spirituality/religiosity and health from one form of spirituality/religiosity to another, across denominations, or to assume effects are uniform for men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2005.11.008|pmid=16359765|title=Gender differences in religious practices, spiritual experiences and health: Results from the US General Social Survey|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|volume=62|issue=11|pages=2848–2860|year=2006|last1=Maselko|first1=Joanna|last2=Kubzansky|first2=Laura D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Violence===
{{main|Religious violence}}
{{See also|Islam and violence|Christianity and violence|Judaism and violence}}
[[File:UA Flight 175 hits WTC south tower 9-11 edit.jpeg|thumb|[[United Airlines Flight 175]] hits the South Tower during the [[September 11 attacks]] of 2001 in [[New York City]]. The September 11 attacks (also referred to as 9/11) were a series of four coordinated [[Terrorism|terrorist attacks]] by the [[Islamic terrorism|Islamic terrorist]] group [[al-Qaeda]] on the [[United States]] on the morning of Tuesday, September 11, 2001.]]

Critics like [[Hector Avalos]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Fighting Words: The Origins of Religious Violence |first=Hector |last=Avalos |publisher=Prometheus Books |location=Amherst, New York |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Regina Schwartz]],&lt;ref name=ReginaSchwartz&gt;{{cite book |title=The Curse of Cain: The Violent Legacy of Monotheism By Regina M. Schwartz |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christopher Hitchens]] and [[Richard Dawkins]] have argued that religions are inherently violent and harmful to society by using violence to promote their goals, in ways that are endorsed and exploited by their leaders.&lt;ref name="Hitchens 2007"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Hitchens |first=Christopher |title=God is not Great |publisher=Twelve |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;ref name="Dawkins 2006"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Dawkins |first=Richard |title=The God Delusion |publisher=Bantam Books |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}

Anthropologist Jack David Eller asserts that religion is not inherently violent, arguing "religion and violence are clearly compatible, but they are not identical." He asserts that "violence is neither essential to nor exclusive to religion" and that "virtually every form of religious violence has its nonreligious corollary."&lt;ref name="CruelCreeds1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Eller |first=Jack David |title=Cruel Creeds, Virtuous Violence: Religious Violence Across Culture and History |year=2010 |publisher=Prometheus Books |isbn=978-1-61614-218-6 |quote=As we have insisted previously, religion is not inherently and irredeemably violent; it certainly is not the essence and source of all violence.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CruelCreeds2"&gt;{{cite book |last=Eller |first=Jack David |title=Cruel Creeds, Virtuous Violence: Religious Violence Across Culture and History |year=2010 |publisher=Prometheus Books |isbn=978-1-61614-218-6 |quote=Religion and violence are clearly compatible, but they are not identical. Violence is one phenomenon in human (and natural existence), religion is another, and it is inevitable that the two would become intertwined. Religion is complex and modular, and violence is one of the modules—not universal, but recurring. As a conceptual and behavioral module, violence is by no means exclusive to religion. There are plenty of other groups, institutions, interests, and ideologies to promote violence. Violence is, therefore, neither essential to nor exclusive to religion. Nor is religious violence all alike... And virtually every form of religious violence has its nonreligious corollary.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Animal sacrifice ====
Done by some (but not all) religions, [[animal sacrifice]] is the [[ritual]] killing and offering of an animal to appease or maintain favour with a [[deity]]. It has been banned in [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/02/india-court-bans-animal-sacrifice-hindu-temples |title=Indian court bans animal sacrifice |last=France-Presse |first=Agence|newspaper=The Guardian |date=2014-09-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Superstition ===
{{Further|Superstition|Magical thinking|Magic and religion}}
Greek and Roman pagans, who saw their relations with the gods in political and social terms, scorned the man who constantly trembled with fear at the thought of the gods (''deisidaimonia''), as a slave might fear a cruel and capricious master. The Romans called such fear of the gods ''superstitio''.&lt;ref&gt;Veyne 1987, p. 211 {{Citation not found}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Ancient Greek]] historian [[Polybius]] described superstition in [[Ancient Rome]] as an ''[[instrumentum regni]]'', an instrument of maintaining the cohesion of the [[Roman Empire|Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Polybius, [[The Histories (Polybius)|The Histories]], VI 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Superstition has been described as the non rational establishment of cause and effect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~kfoster/FosterKokko2008%20Proc%20B%20superstition.pdf Kevin R. Foster and Hanna Kokko, "The evolution of superstitious and superstition-like behaviour", ''Proc. R. Soc. B'' (2009) 276, 31–37] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100728042608/http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~kfoster/FosterKokko2008%20Proc%20B%20superstition.pdf |date=28 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Religion is more complex and is often composed of social institutions and has a moral aspect. Some religions may include superstitions or make use of magical thinking. Adherents of one religion sometimes think of other religions as superstition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Religion Explained |last=Boyer | first = Pascal |year=2001 |chapter=Why Belief |authorlink=Pascal Boyer |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=wreF80OHTicC&amp;pg=PA297&amp;lpg=PA297&amp;dq=%22fang+too+were+quite+amazed%22|title-link=Religion Explained }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nailed : ten Christian myths that show Jesus never existed at all|last=David|first=Fitzgerald|isbn=9780557709915|location=[Place of publication not identified]|oclc=701249439|date = October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some [[atheists]], [[deists]], and [[skeptics]] regard religious belief as superstition.

The Roman Catholic Church considers superstition to be sinful in the sense that it denotes a lack of trust in the divine providence of God and, as such, is a violation of the first of the Ten Commandments. The [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] states that superstition "in some sense represents a perverse excess of religion" (para. #2110).  "Superstition," it says, "is a deviation of religious feeling and of the practices this feeling imposes. It can even affect the worship we offer the true God, e.g., when one attributes an importance in some way magical to certain practices otherwise lawful or necessary. To attribute the efficacy of prayers or of sacramental signs to their mere external performance, apart from the interior dispositions that they demand is to fall into superstition. Cf. Matthew 23:16–22" (para. #2111)

===Agnosticism and atheism===
{{Main|Atheism|Agnosticism|Irreligion|Antireligion|Humanism}}
{{See also|Criticism of atheism}}
The terms [[atheist]] (lack of belief in any gods) and agnostic (belief in the unknowability of the existence of gods), though specifically contrary to theistic (e.g. Christian, Jewish, and Muslim) religious teachings, do not by definition mean the opposite of religious. There are religions (including Buddhism, Taoism, and Hinduism), in fact, that classify some of their followers as agnostic, atheistic, or [[nontheism|nontheistic]]. The true opposite of religious is the word irreligious. [[Irreligion]] describes an absence of any religion; [[antireligion]] describes an active opposition or aversion toward religions in general.

===Interfaith cooperation===
{{Main|Interfaith dialogue}}
Because religion continues to be recognized in Western thought as a universal impulse{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}, many religious practitioners{{who|date=July 2016}} have aimed to band together in [[interfaith]] dialogue, cooperation, and [[Religion and peacebuilding|religious peacebuilding]]. The first major dialogue was the [[Parliament of the World's Religions]] at the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition|Chicago World's Fair]], which affirmed universal values and recognition of the diversity of practices among different cultures. The 20th century has been especially fruitful in use of interfaith dialogue as a means of solving ethnic, political, or even religious conflict, with [[Christian–Jewish reconciliation]] representing a complete reverse in the attitudes of many Christian communities towards Jews.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Recent interfaith initiatives include A Common Word, launched in 2007 and focused on bringing Muslim and Christian leaders together,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://acommonword.com/|title=A Common Word Between Us and You|work=acommonword.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; the "C1 World Dialogue",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.c1worlddialogue.com/|title=konsoleH :: Login|work=c1worlddialogue.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110128195027/http://www.c1worlddialogue.com/|archivedate=28 January 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Common Ground initiative between Islam and Buddhism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://islambuddhism.com/|title=Islam and Buddhism|work=islambuddhism.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[United Nations]] sponsored "World Interfaith Harmony Week".&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldinterfaithharmonyweek.com/ World Interfaith Harmony Week]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldinterfaithharmonyweek.com/world-interfaith-harmony-week-resolution/|title=» World Interfaith Harmony Week UNGA Resolution A/65/PV.34|work=worldinterfaithharmonyweek.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Culture===
Culture and religion have usually been seen as closely related. [[Paul Tillich]] looked at religion as the soul of culture and culture as the form or framework of religion.&lt;ref&gt;Edward L. Queen, ''
Encyclopedia of American Religious History, Volume 1'' Facts on File, 1996. p. vi.&lt;/ref&gt; In his own words:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Religion as ultimate concern is the meaning-giving substance of culture, and culture is the totality of forms in which the basic concern of religion expresses itself. In abbreviation: religion is the substance of culture, culture is the form of religion. Such a consideration definitely prevents the establishment of a dualism of religion and culture. Every religious act, not only in organized religion, but also in the most intimate movement of the soul, is culturally formed.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Tillich, ''Theology of Culture'', Robert C. Kimball (ed), (Oxford University Press, 1959). p.42&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Ernst Troeltsch]], similarly, looked at culture as the soil of religion and thought that, therefore, transplanting a religion from its original culture to a foreign culture would actually kill it in the same manner that transplanting a plant from its natural soil to an alien soil would kill it. &lt;ref&gt;Eric J. Sharpe, "Religion and Cultures", An inaugural lecture delivered on 6 July, 1977 by Eric J. Sharpe, Professor of Religious Studies in the University of Sydney. Accessed at [https://openjournals.library.sydney.edu.au/index.php/ART/article/download/5496/6167 Openjournals] on June 22, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; However, there have been many attempts in the modern pluralistic situation to distinguish culture from religion.&lt;ref&gt;See Taslima Nasreen, [https://www.outlookindia.com/magazine/story/i-say-three-cheers-for-ayaan/232289 "I Say, Three Cheers For Ayaan",] ''Outlook, The Magazine'' 28 August 2006. Also, Nemani Delaibatiki, [http://fijisun.com.fj/2017/07/08/religion-and-the-vanua/ "Religion and the Vanua"] ''Fiji Sun'' July 08, 2017 in which the distinctive elements of culture against religion are taken from Domenic Marbaniang, [https://philpapers.org/bbs/thread.pl?tId=959 "Difference Between Culture and Religion: A Proposal Requesting Response"], 12 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  Domenic Marbaniang has argued that elements grounded on beliefs of a metaphysical nature (religious) are distinct from elements grounded on nature and the natural (cultural). For instance, language (with its grammar) is a cultural element while sacralization of language in which a particular religious scripture is written is more often a religious practice. The same applies to music and the arts.&lt;ref&gt;Domenic Marbaniang, "The Gospel and Culture: Areas of Conflict, Consent, and Conversion", ''Journal of Contemporary Christian'' Vol. 6, No. 1 (Bangalore: CFCC, Aug 2014), {{ISSN|2231-5233}} pp. 7–17&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protestantism===
[[Apollo 11]] astronaut [[Buzz Aldrin]], a [[Presbyterian]], performed a [[Eucharist|communion]] service for himself using a kit provided by his church. Aldrin had told flight director [[Chris Kraft]] of his plans and intended to broadcast the service back to Earth but opted not to at the request of [[Deke Slayton]], due to the continuing controversy over Apollo 8's reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Communion in Space|date=October 1970|publisher=Guideposts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman Catholicism===
A signed message from [[Pope Paul VI]] was included among statements from dozens of other world leaders left on the moon on a silicon disk during the [[Apollo 11]] mission.&lt;ref&gt;https://history.nasa.gov/ap11-35ann/goodwill/Apollo_11_material.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Following the mission [[William Donald Borders]], Bishop of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Orlando]], told the Pope that the [[1917 Code of Canon Law]] placed the moon within his diocese, as the first explorers had departed from Cape Kennedy which was under his jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.orlandodiocese.org/fno-diocesan-news/13768-remembering-the-bishop-of-the-moon&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russian Orthodoxy===
Russian Orthodox Christmas was celebrated on the [[International Space Station]], on January 7, 2011.&lt;ref name=russianchristmas&gt;[http://www.space.com/9719-christmas-russians-space.html Tariq Malik - '''Christmas Comes Twice for Russians in Space''' (07 January 2011) - SPACE.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  Cosmonauts had the day off, but one of the other crew [[Twitter|tweeted]], "Merry Christmas to all Russia."&lt;ref name=russianchristmas/&gt; The whole crew also celebrated on December 25, two weeks prior.&lt;ref name=russianchristmas/&gt;

==Islam==
Muslims in space struggle with fulfilling their religious obligations including kneeling and facing Mecca to pray in microgravity traveling at several kilometres per second. The issue first came up when [[Sultan bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud]], a [[House of Saud|Saudi]] prince, flew aboard [[STS-51-G]] and again when [[Anousheh Ansari]] flew as a tourist to the [[International space station]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/1010/p16s02-stss.html|title=How does an Islamic astronaut face Mecca in orbit?|last=Gartner|first=Bettina |date=October 10, 2007|publisher=Christian Science Monitor|accessdate=2009-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In preparation for Malaysian  [[Sheikh Muszaphar Shukor]]'s trip to the ISS in 2007, the [[National Fatwa Council]] created  "Muslim Obligations in the International Space Station" outlining permissible modifications to rituals such as kneeling when praying (not required in space), facing Mecca when praying (left to the astronaut's best abilities at the start of prayer), and washing (a wet towel will suffice).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20894077/|title=Astronaut to grapple with daily prayer ritual|date=September 20, 2007|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|accessdate=2009-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2014, the General Authority of Islamic Affairs and Endowment (GAIAE){{clarify |date=August 2017 |reason=no country specified }} issued a [[fatwa]] forbidding devout Muslims from participating as crew members in [[Mars One]]'s proposed one way mission to [[Mars]]. Speaking for the clerical group, Farooq Hamada explained that, "Protecting life against all possible dangers and keeping it safe is an issue agreed upon by all religions and is clearly stipulated in verse 4/29 of the Holy Quran: Do not kill yourselves or one another. Indeed, Allah is to you ever Merciful."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/02/22/muslim_clerics_issue_fatwa_banning_the_devout_from_mars_one_suicide_mission/|title=Muslim clerics issue fatwa banning the devout from Mars One 'suicide' mission|date=February 22, 2014|publisher=The A Register|accessdate=2014-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judaism==
An example of Judaism in space occurred in 2003, when a [[Microform|microfilm]] [[Torah]] and a written copy of the [[Kiddush|Shabbat kiddush]] were brought into orbit by [[Ilan Ramon]].&lt;ref name=thom/&gt;

The '''Royal Navy Chaplaincy Service''' provides [[Military chaplain|chaplains]] to the [[Royal Navy]]. The chaplains are commissioned by the Sovereign but do not hold military rank other than that of "Chaplain Royal Navy". They are usually addressed as Padre, Reverend or more informally Bish. Chaplains are recruited from a number of [[Christian denominations]].

The senior chaplain in the Royal Navy is currently [[Martyn Gough (chaplain)|Martyn Gough]]. An Anglican priest, he is also the Archdeacon for the Royal Navy.

==Training==
Chaplains undergo training at [[Britannia Royal Naval College]] alongside other [[Royal Navy]] officer cadets. After completing the course they may opt to earn their "Dolphins" and serve in the [[Royal Navy Submarine Service|Submarine Service]] or the [[green beret]] (upon completion of the [[All Arms Commando Course]]) and serve with the [[Royal Marines]].

==Chaplains of the Fleet==

'''Sacred''' is dedicated or set apart for the service or worship of a [[deity]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sacred&lt;/ref&gt; or considered worthy of spiritual [[respect]] or devotion; or inspiring [[awe]] or [[Reverence (emotion)|reverence]] among believers. The property is often ascribed to objects (a "sacred artifact" that is [[Veneration|venerated]] and [[Blessing|blessed]]), or places ("sacred ground").

French [[Sociology|sociologist]] [[Émile Durkheim]] considered the [[dichotomy]] between the sacred and the [[profanum|profane]] to be the central characteristic of [[religion]]: "religion is a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to ''sacred things'', that is to say, things set apart and forbidden."&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim 1915, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; In Durkheim's theory, the sacred represented the interests of the group, especially unity, which were embodied in sacred group symbols, or [[totems]]. The profane, on the other hand, involved mundane individual concerns.

Although there are similarities between the terms "sacred" and "holy" and they are sometimes used interchangeably, there are subtle differences.&lt;ref name=difference&gt;[http://www.differencebetween.com/difference-between-sacred-and-holy/ "Difference Between Sacred and Holy", DifferenceBetween.com, September 26, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; "Holiness" is generally the term used in relation to persons and relationship, while "sacredness" is used in relation to objects, places, or happenings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=YGX6oKlw24UC&amp;pg=PA42&amp;lpg=PA42&amp;dq=holiness+vs+sacredness&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LSBrWEffCh&amp;sig=3Bjyli7MdxC5cMQ0L544nETGNTk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwixsdmn3LjQAhVq44MKHSCVC8k4FBDoAQg7MAs#v=onepage&amp;q=holiness%20vs%20sacredness&amp;f=false McCann, Catherine.

==Etymology==
The word "sacred" descends from the [[Latin]] ''[[wikt:sacer|sacer]]'', that is consecrated, or dedicated&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=NmogAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA889&amp;lpg=PA889&amp;dq=holiness+vs+sacredness&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZSLIJdyPqp&amp;sig=zO322whbPNR1CiW-VdfEIncC6ss&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiZv5aJ0LjQAhUB7IMKHQcJBcw4ChDoAQg5MAc#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Sacred", ''A Dictionary of the English Language'' (James Stormonth, Philip Henry Phelp, eds.), Blackwood &amp; sons, 1895, p.883]&lt;/ref&gt; to the gods or anything in their power, and to ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#sacerdos|sacerdos]]'' and ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#sacerdos|sanctum]]'', set apart.

==Distinguished from "Holy"==

Although there are similarities between the terms "sacred" and "holy" and they are sometimes used interchangeably, there are subtle differences.&lt;ref name=difference&gt;[http://www.differencebetween.com/difference-between-sacred-and-holy/ "Difference Between Sacred and Holy", DifferenceBetween.com, September 26, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; "Holiness" is generally the term used in relation to persons and relationship, while "sacredness" is used in relation to objects, places, or happenings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=YGX6oKlw24UC&amp;pg=PA42&amp;lpg=PA42&amp;dq=holiness+vs+sacredness&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LSBrWEffCh&amp;sig=3Bjyli7MdxC5cMQ0L544nETGNTk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwixsdmn3LjQAhVq44MKHSCVC8k4FBDoAQg7MAs#v=onepage&amp;q=holiness%20vs%20sacredness&amp;f=false McCann, Catherine. ''New Paths Toward the Sacred Thus'', Paulist Press, 2008] {{ISBN|9780809145515}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus a saint may be considered as holy, but he is not viewed as sacred. However, there are things that are both holy and sacred such as the holy bible.&lt;ref name=difference/&gt;

The English word "holy" dates back to at least the 11th century with the [[Old English]] word ''[[hālig]]'', an adjective derived from ''hāl'' meaning "whole" and used to mean "uninjured, sound, healthy, entire, complete". The Scottish ''hale'' ("health, happiness and wholeness") is the most complete modern form of this Old English root. The word "holy" in its modern form appears in [[Wycliffe's Bible]] of 1382. In non-specialist contexts, the term "holy" is used in a more general way, to refer to someone or something that is associated with a [[Divine grace|divine power]], such as [[Holy water|water]] used for [[baptism]].

While both words denote something or someone set apart to the worship of God and therefore worthy of respect and in some cases veneration, "holy" (the stronger word) implies an inherent or essential character.&lt;ref&gt;"Sacred", ''
Webster's Collegiate Dictionary'', 5th edition, p.875&lt;/ref&gt; Holiness originates in God and is communicated to things, places, times, and persons engaged in His Service. Thus Aquinas Thomas defines "holiness" as that virtue by which a man's mind applies itself and all its acts to God; he ranks it among the infused moral [[Virtue|virtues]], and identifies it with the virtue of religion, but with this difference that, whereas religion is the virtue whereby one offers God due service in the things which pertain to the Divine service, holiness is the virtue by which one makes all one's acts subservient to God. Thus holiness or sanctity is the outcome of sanctification, that Divine act by which God freely justifies a person, and by which He has claimed them for His own.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07386a.htm Pope, Hugh. "Holiness." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 7. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 20 November 2016. {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic views==

===Hierology===
{{See also|Hierotopy}}
Hierology ([[Greek language|Greek]] ιερος, ''hieros'', "sacred" or "holy", + [[-logy]]) is the study of [[Religious text|sacred literature]] or [[Folklore|lore]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Hierology dictionary.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/hierology?q=Hierology Oxford Dictionary Online]&lt;/ref&gt;

===History of religions===
{{Main article|History of religions}}
[[Mircea Eliade]] outlines that religion should not be interpreted only as 'belief in deities', but as 'experience of the sacred'. He analyses the dialectic of the sacred.&lt;ref&gt;Altizer, Thomas J. J. (1968), ''Mircea Eliade and the Dialectic of the Sacred'', Philadelphia: The Westminster Press. {{ISBN|978-083-7171-96-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The sacred is presented in relation to the profane.&lt;ref&gt;Eliade, Mircea (1987), ''The Sacred and the Profane: The Nature of Religion'', translated by Willard R. Trask. San Diego: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, Inc. {{ISBN|978-0156-79201-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The relation between the sacred and the profane is not of opposition, but of complementarity, as the profane is viewed as a [[hierophany]].&lt;ref&gt;Iţu, Mircia (2006), ''Mircea Eliade'', Bucharest: Editura Fundaţiei România de Mâine, p. 35. {{ISBN|973-725-715-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sociology===
{{Main article|Sacred–profane dichotomy}}
French [[Sociology|sociologist]] [[Émile Durkheim]] considered the [[dichotomy]] between the [[Sacred (comparative religion)|sacred]] and the [[profanum|profane]] to be the central characteristic of [[religion]]: "religion is a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to ''sacred things'', that is to say, things set apart and forbidden."&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim 1915, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; In Durkheim's theory, the sacred represented the interests of the group, especially unity, which were embodied in sacred group symbols, or [[totems]]. The profane, on the other hand, involved mundane individual concerns. Durkheim explicitly stated that the dichotomy sacred/profane was not equivalent to [[Good and evil|good/evil]]. The sacred could be [[good]] or [[evil]], and the profane could be either as well.&lt;ref&gt;Pals 1996, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious views==

===Buddhism===
In [[Theravada]] Buddhism one finds the designation of 'noble person' or ''ariyapuggala''  ([[Pali]]). The Buddha described four grades of such person depending on their level of purity. This purity is measured by which of the ten [[Fetter (Buddhism)|fetter]]s (''samyojana'') and ''[[Kleśā (Buddhism)|klesha]]'' have been purified and integrated from the [[mindstream]]. These persons are called (in order of increasing sanctity) ''[[Sotāpanna]]'', ''[[Sakadagami]]'', ''[[Anāgāmi]]'' and ''[[Arhat|Arahant]]''.

===Christianity===
{{Attributes of God}}
More traditional [[Christian denominations|denominations]], such as the [[Anglican]], [[Catholic]], [[Lutheran]], and [[Methodist]] Churches, believe in [[Holy Sacraments]] that the clergy perform, such as [[Holy Communion]] and [[Holy Baptism]], as well as strong belief in the [[Four marks of the church|Holy Catholic Church]], [[Bible|Holy Scripture]], [[Holy Trinity]], and the [[Covenant (biblical)|Holy Covenant]]. They also believe that angels and saints are called to holiness.

====Catholicism====&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Purgatory]] --&gt;
{{See also|Sanctum sanctorum}}
[[File:Persian Cock.jpg|thumb|right|Vatican Persian Cock – A 1919 print of a fabric square of a Persian [[rooster|cock]] or a Persian bird design belonging to the Vatican ([[Holy See]]) in Rome dating to 600 CE. Notice the [[halo (religious iconography)|halo]] denoting the status of being holy or sacred.]]
[[Catholic Church|Catholicism]] has inherited much of the Jewish vision of the world in terms of holiness, with certain behaviour appropriate to certain places and times. The calendar gives shape to Catholic practice, which tends to focus on the [[Eucharist]], in which the [[Real Presence]] of [[Christ]] is manifested. [[feast day|Holy days]], celebrating events of the life of Christ and the lives of [[Saint#Catholic Church|Catholic saints]] officially recognized as holy, are celebrated throughout the year.

Many features of the Jewish temple (although now seen as having Christian significance) are imitated in [[Church (building)|churches]], such as the [[altar]], bread, lamp, [[incense]], [[baptismal font|font]], etc., to emphasise the extreme holiness of the Eucharistic elements, which are reserved in a [[church tabernacle|tabernacle]]. In extension of this focus on the Sacrament as holy, many objects in Catholicism are also considered holy. They are called [[sacramentals]] and are usually blessed by a priest. Such items include [[rosary|rosaries]], [[crucifix]]es, medals, and statues and icons of [[Jesus]], [[angel]]s and [[saint]]s (e.g. [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Virgin Mary]]). While Catholics believe that holy places and objects (i.e., objects dedicated to God for sacred use) should be respected and not put to profane use, the [[Catholic Church]] condemns worshiping the object itself, as any worship given to something other than God is considered [[idolatry]].

People in a state of sanctifying [[Actual grace|grace]] are also considered holy in Catholicism. A central notion of Catholicism as articulated in contemporary theology is the "[personal] call to holiness," considered to be a [[vocation]] shared by every Christian believer. Profound personal holiness has traditionally also been seen as a focus for the kind of contagious holiness primarily associated with the Sacrament. So the [[communion of saints]] in Catholicism is not only the acclamation of their [[piety]] or [[morality]], but also reverence for the tangible holiness that flows from their proximity to the divine. Hence the places where saints lived, died, performed miracles, or received visions frequently become sites of [[pilgrimage]], and notable objects surviving a saint (including the body or parts of it) are considered [[relics]]. The holiness of such places or objects, resulting from contact with a deeply holy person, is often connected with the miraculous long after the death of the saint.

[[Sanctus]] (Latin for "holy") is the name of an important hymn of Christian liturgy. The [[Trisagion]] ('Thrice Holy') is a standard hymn of the Divine Liturgy of the Eastern Churches.

====Lutheranism====
[[File:Chancel of Trinity Lutheran Church on Easter Sunday.jpeg|thumb|On [[Easter Sunday]], the [[chancel]] of this Lutheran church is adorned with [[Lilium longiflorum|Easter lilies]], a symbol of the [[resurrection of Christ]], and white [[parament]]s, the liturgical colour of [[Eastertide]].]]
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2011}}
The early Protestant Reformers, who were often scholars of Ancient Greek and also borrowed from Jewish scholarship, recognized that holiness is an [[Attributes of God in Christianity|attribute]] of [[God]], and holiness is always part of the [[presence of God]]. Yet they also recognized that "practical holiness" was the evidence of the presence of God in the converted believer. [[Martin Luther]] viewed God's [[Grace (Christianity)|grace]] (and therefore God's holiness), as an invasion of the life. Actions that demonstrated holiness would spring up, not premeditated, as believers focused more and more on their relationship with Christ. This was the life of [[faith]], according to Luther; a life in which one recognizes that the sin inherent in human nature never departs, yet grace invades each human spirit and draws each person after Christ.

====Reformed====
[[John Calvin|Calvin]], on the other hand, formulated a practical system of holiness that even tied in with culture and social [[justice]]. All unholy actions, Calvin reasoned, resulted in [[suffering]]. Thus he proved out to the city fathers of [[Geneva]] that dancing and other social vices always ended with the wealthy oppressing the poor. A holy life, in his outlook, was pietistic and simple, a life that shunned extravagance, excess, and vanity. On a personal level, Calvin believed that suffering would be a manifestation of taking on the [[Cross of Christ]], but suffering was also part of the process of holiness. He expected that all Christians would suffer in this life, not as punishment, but rather as participation in union with Christ, who suffered for them. And yet, socially, Calvin argued that a holy society would end up as a gentle, kindly society (except to criminals) where the poor would be protected from the abuses of the wealthy, the lawyers, and others who normally preyed upon them.

====Wesleyan-Arminian====
{{further|Works of Piety}}
In [[Methodism]], holiness has acquired the secondary meaning of the reshaping of a person through spiritual [[Born again (Christianity)|rebirth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Methodist Visitor|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uEAEAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA137|year=1876|publisher=Elliot Stock, 62, Paternoster Row, E.C. |page=137|quote="Ye must be born again." Yield to God that He may perform this work in and for you. Admit Him to your heart. "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved."}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term owes its origin to [[John Wesley]], who stressed "scriptural holiness", as well as [[Christian perfection]].

The [[Holiness movement]] began within [[Methodism]] in the [[United States]], among those who thought the church had lost the zeal and emphasis on personal holiness of Wesley's day. In the latter part of the 19th century revival meetings were held, attended by thousands. In [[Vineland, New Jersey|Vineland, N.J]] in 1867 a camp meeting was begun and the National Holiness Camp Meeting Association went on to establish many holiness [[camp meeting]]s across the nation. Some adherents to the movement remained within their denominations; others founded new denominations, such as the [[Free Methodist Church]], the [[Church of the Nazarene]], and the [[Church of God (Anderson)]]. Within a generation another movement, the Pentecostal movement was born, drawing heavily from the Holiness movement. Around the middle of the 20th century, the [[Conservative Holiness Movement]], a conservative offshoot of the Holiness movement, was born. The [[Higher Life movement]] appeared in the British Isles during the mid-19th century.

In the contemporary Holiness movement, the idea that holiness is relational is growing. In this thought, the core notion of holiness is [[love]]. Other notions of holiness, such as purity, being set apart, perfection, keeping rules, and total commitment, are seen as contributory notions of holiness. These contributory notions find their ultimate legitimacy when love is at their core ([[Thomas Jay Oord]] and Michael Lodahl).

Commonly recognized outward expressions or "standards" of holiness among more fundamental adherents frequently include applications relative to dress, hair, and appearance:  e.g., short hair on men, uncut hair on women, and prohibitions against shorts, pants on women, make-up and jewelry. Other common injunctions are against places of worldly amusement, mixed swimming, smoking, [[minced oaths]], as well as the eschewing of television and radio.

====Orthodoxy====
{{See also|Glorification}}

===Islam===
Among the [[names of God in the Qur'an]] is القدوس (''Al-Quddus'') : found in {{cite quran|59|23|style=nosup|expand=no}} and {{cite quran|62|1|style=nosup|expand=no}}, the closest English translation is "holy" or "sacred". It shares the [[Q-D-Š|same triliteral Semitic root]] as the Hebrew ''kodesh'' (see below). Another use of the same root is found in the Arabic name for Jerusalem: ''[[al-Quds]]'', "the Holy".

The word حرام ''(ħarām)'', often translated as "prohibited" or "forbidden", is better understood as "sacred" or "sanctuary" in the context of places considered sacred in Islam, ''e.&amp;thinsp;g.'': the ''[[Masjid al-Haram]]'', the Sacred Mosque in [[Mecca]], constituting the immediate precincts of the [[Ka'aba]]; ''[[Haram (site)|al-Haramain]]'' or "the (two) Sanctuaries", a reference to the twin holy cities of Mecca and [[Medina]]; and the ''[[Haram ash-Sharif]]'' or Noble Sanctuary, the precincts of the [[Dome of the Rock]] and [[al-Aqsa Mosque]] in [[Jerusalem]].

===Judaism===
{{see also|Q-D-Š|Tzadik|Holy of Holies}}
The Hebrew word קֹדֶשׁ, transliterated as ''qodesh'', has been used in the [[Torah]] to mean set-apartness and separateness as well as holiness and sacredness.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
|url=https://www.blueletterbible.org//lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=h6944&amp;t=HNV
|title="H6944 - qodesh - Strong's Hebrew Lexicon (HNV)."
|author=Blue Letter Bible.
|accessdate=28 Jun 2016}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The Torah describes the [[Kohen|Aaronite priests]] and the [[Levite]]s as being selected by God to perform the Temple services; they, as well, are called "holy." Some{{who|date=September 2011}} consider that the Hebrew noun for "holiness," ''kedushah'' ({{lang-he|קדושה}}), from the adjective ''kodesh'', "holy," has the connotation of "separateness".{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

However, holiness is not a single state, but contains a broad spectrum. The [[Mishnah]] lists concentric circles of holiness surrounding the [[Temple in Jerusalem]]: [[Holy of Holies]], Temple Sanctuary, Temple Vestibule, Court of Priests, Court of Israelites, Court of Women, [[Temple Mount]], the walled city of [[Jerusalem]], all the walled cities of Israel, and the borders of the [[Land of Israel]].{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} Distinctions are made as to who and what are permitted in each area.

Likewise, the [[Jewish holidays]] and the [[Shabbat]] are considered to be holy in time; the Torah calls them "holy [days of] gathering". Work is not allowed on those days, and rabbinic tradition lists [[39 categories of activity prohibited on Shabbat|39 categories of activity]] that are specifically prohibited.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

Beyond the intrinsically holy, objects can become sacred through [[consecration]]. Any personal possession may be dedicated to the Temple of God, after which its misappropriation is considered among the gravest of sins. The various [[Korban|sacrifices]] are holy. Those that may be eaten have very specific rules concerning who may eat which of their parts, and time limits on when the consumption must be completed. Most sacrifices contain a part to be consumed by the priests – a portion of the holy to be consumed by God's holy devotees.

The encounter with the holy is seen as eminently desirable, and at the same time fearful and awesome. For the strongest penalties are applied to one who transgresses in this area – one could in theory receive either the death penalty or the heavenly punishment of ''[[kareth]]'', spiritual excision, for mis-stepping in his close approach to God's domain.

Sai Baba's purported [[Materialization (parapsychology)|materialisations]] of ''[[Vibhuti#Sacred ash|vibhuti]]'' (holy ash) and other small objects such as rings, necklaces, and watches, were a source of both fame and controversy.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/this_world/3813469.stm|title=Sai Baba: God-man or con man?|last=Datta|first=Tanya|date=17 June 2004|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have analyzed them as being mere  [[sleight of hand]]; while his devotees considered them signs of his divinity.&lt;ref&gt;Search for the Guru, Peter Mt.

==Early life==

Almost everything known about Sai Baba's early life stems from the [[hagiography]] that grew around him, narratives that hold special meaning to his devotees and are considered by them to be evidence of his divine nature.&lt;ref name="BabbLawrence"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UrbanHugh74" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Palmer99&gt;Palmer, Norris W.

Sai Baba's siblings included elder brother Ratnakaram Seshama Raju (1911–1985), sisters Venkamma (1918–1993) and Parvathamma (1920–1998), and younger brother Janakiramaiah (1931–2003).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Times of India |title=&amp;#145;Vaastu dosham&amp;#146; at hospital he built, say Sai kin |date=25 April 2011 |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-04-22/india/29463028_1_sathya-sai-baba-satyajit-trust-affairsnephew }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proclamation==

[[File:Baba-1940's.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Sai Baba at the age of 14, soon after proclaiming he was the reincarnation of Shirdi Sai Baba]]
On 8 March 1940, while living with his elder brother Seshama Raju in [[Uravakonda]], a small town near Puttaparthi, 14 year old Sathya was apparently stung by a scorpion.&lt;ref name="AlexandraKent"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Larson"/&gt; He lost consciousness for several hours&lt;ref name="kent"/&gt; and in the next few days underwent a noticeable change in behaviour.&lt;ref name="Larson"/&gt; There were "symptoms of laughing and weeping, eloquence and silence."&lt;ref name="Larson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="serpent"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vahini.org/sss/i/serpent.html |title=Sathyam Sivam Sundaram Part I: 5. The Serpent Hill |publisher=Vahini.org |date=8 March 1940 |accessdate=6 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is claimed that then "he began to sing [[Sanskrit]] verses, a language of which it is alleged he had no prior knowledge."&lt;ref name="RichardWeiss"/&gt; Doctors concluded his behaviour to be [[hysteria]].&lt;ref name="RichardWeiss"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Larson"/&gt; Concerned, his parents brought Sathya back home to Puttaparthi&lt;ref name="sss3620"&gt;{{cite web| last = Staff| first =| title = Sathya Sai Speaks Volume 36 (2003): 20.

One of the exorcists at [[Kadiri]], a town near Puttaparthi, went to the extent of torturing him with the aim of curing him;{{elucidate|date=March 2013}} Sathya seemingly kept calm throughout the torture.&lt;ref name="Larson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="serpent"/&gt;

On 23 May 1940, Sathya called household members and reportedly materialised sugar candy (''[[prasad]])'' and flowers for them.&lt;ref name="Kheirabadi2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Masoud Kheirabadi|title=Sri Satya Sai Baba|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n06499wG5VcC&amp;pg=PA28|accessdate=24 April 2011|date=March 2005|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-0-7910-8104-4|pages=28–}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father became furious at seeing this, thinking his son was [[Spirit possession|bewitched]]. He took a stick and threatened to beat him if Sathya did not reveal who he really was, the young Sathya responded calmly and firmly "I am Sai Baba", a reference to [[Sai Baba of Shirdi]].&lt;ref name="RichardWeiss"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kent"/&gt; This was the first time he proclaimed himself to be the reincarnation of Sai Baba of Shirdi—a saint who became famous in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in [[Maharashtra]] and had died eight years before Sathya was born.&lt;ref name="RichardWeiss"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sss3620"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schulman, Arnold 1971 pp. 122"&gt;Schulman, Arnold (1971).

==First mandir and development of Puttaparthi==

In 1944, a [[mandir]] for Sai Baba's devotees was built near the village of [[Puttaparthi]]. It is now referred to as the "old mandir".&lt;ref name="murphetman"&gt;Murphet, Howard (1977), ''Man of Miracles'', Weiser, {{ISBN|0-87728-335-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bowen"&gt;Bowen, David (1988).

==Stroke, paralysis and prediction of reincarnation==

In 1963, it was asserted that Sai Baba suffered a stroke and four severe heart attacks, which left him paralysed on one side.&lt;ref name="murphetmiracle"&gt;Murphet, Howard (1977). ''Man of Miracles''. Weiser. {{ISBN|0-87728-335-4}} portions available online https://books.google.com/books?id=BPsVFqhclS0C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; These events culminated in an event where he apparently healed himself in front of the thousands of people gathered in Prashanthi Nilayam who were then praying for his recovery.&lt;ref name="BabbLawrence"/&gt;

On recovering, Sai Baba announced that he would one day next be reborn as an incarnation named ''Prema Sai Baba'' in the neighbouring state of [[Karnataka]].&lt;ref name="BabbLawrence"/&gt; He stated, "I am Shiva-Sakthi, born in the [[gotra]] (lineage) of [[Bharadwaja]], according to a boon won by that sage from [[Shiva|Siva]] and [[Shakti|Sakthi]].

==Africa==

On 29 June 1968, Sai Baba made his only overseas trip, to [[Kenya]] and [[Uganda]].&lt;ref name="murphetmiracle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kasturi3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vahini.org/sss/iii/awakening.html |title=Sathyam Sivam Sundaram Part III: 3.

I have not come on behalf of any exclusive religion. I have not come on a mission of publicity for a sect or creed or cause, nor have I come to collect followers for a doctrine.

==Later years==

In 1968, he established Dharmakshetra or the Sathyam Mandir in [[Mumbai]].&lt;ref name="Official"/&gt; In 1973, he established the Shivam Mandir in [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]].&lt;ref name="Official"/&gt; On 19 January 1981, in [[Chennai]], he inaugurated the Sundaram Mandir.&lt;ref name="Official"/&gt;

In a [[1993 Murders in Prashanthi Nilayam|1993 incident]], four intruders armed with knives entered his bedroom, either as an assassination attempt or as part of a power struggle between his followers. Sai Baba was unharmed. During the scuffle and the police response, the intruders and two of Sai Baba's attendants were killed. The official investigation left questions unanswered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/who-is-sri-sathya-sai-baba-101102|title=Who is Sri Sathya Sai Baba?|agency=Press Trust of India|date=24 April 2011|publisher=[[NDTV]]|accessdate=25 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/religion-obituaries/8471342/Sathya-Sai-Baba.html |title=Religion Obituaries; Satya Sai Baba |publisher=The Telegraph |date=24 April 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report_sathya-sai-baba-escaped-murder-attempt_1535839 |title=Sathya Sai Baba escaped murder attempt|date=25 April 2011|last=Madhusoodan|first=M K |work=[[Daily News and Analysis]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1995, Sai Baba started a project to provide drinking water to 1.2 million people in the drought-prone Rayalaseema region in the [[Anantapur district]] of [[Andhra Pradesh]].&lt;ref name = "cmpraise"/&gt; In April 1999 he inaugurated the Ananda Nilayam Mandir in [[Madurai]], Tamil Nadu.

In 2001 he established another free super-speciality hospital in [[Bangalore]] to benefit the poor.&lt;ref name="TheHinduNewspaper"/&gt; The ''[[Vancouver Sun]]'' in 2001 reported that Sai Baba told his adherents not to browse the Internet&lt;ref name= VS&gt;The Vancouver Sun, 27 February 2001, ''Holy man? Sex abuser? Both?''&lt;/ref&gt; after Sai Baba said, "These teachings (the Vedas) are highly sacred. Today people are ready to believe all that they see on television and internet but do not repose their faith in the Vedic declarations. Internet is like a waste paper basket. Follow the 'innernet,' not the internet."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sssbpt.info/ssspeaks/volume33/sss33-17.pdf 17. The Source And Centre Of Values]. sssbpt.info&lt;/ref&gt;

==Old age and illness==

In 2003, Sai Baba suffered a fractured hip when a student standing on an iron stool slipped and the boy and stool both fell on him. After that he gave [[darshana]] from a car or his porte chair.&lt;ref name="RadioSai20060407"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiosai.org/Pages/PB_20060407.htm |title=Sai Global Harmony – Prasanthi Bulletin |publisher=Radiosai.org |date=7 April 2006 |accessdate=6 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ibnlive.in.com82-2"&gt;{{cite web

==Death==

{{Wikinews|Renowned Indian guru Śrī Satya Sai Baba dies aged 84}}
On 28 March 2011, Sai Baba was admitted to the [[Sri Sathya Sai Super Speciality Hospital]] at Prashantigram at Puttaparthi, following respiration-related problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = Sai Baba in stable condition: Hospital| newspaper = [[Hindustan Times]]| date = 5 April 2011| url = http://www.hindustantimes.com/Sai-Baba-in-stable-condition-Hospital/Article1-681433.aspx| accessdate = 24 April 2011| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110509014742/http://www.hindustantimes.com/Sai-Baba-in-stable-condition-Hospital/Article1-681433.aspx| archivedate = 9 May 2011| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Baba's health condition 'stable' | newspaper = [[The Times of India]] | date = 6 April 2011 | url = http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-04-06/hyderabad/29388337_1_vital-parameters-condition-crrt | accessdate = 24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After nearly a month of hospitalisation, during which his condition progressively deteriorated, Sai Baba died on Sunday, 24 April at 7:40 IST, aged 84.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Spiritual leader Sathya Sai Baba passes away | newspaper = [[The Times of India]] | date = 24 April 2011 | url = http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-04-24/india/29468573_1_sai-baba-sathya-sai-central-trust-puttaparthi   | accessdate = 24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sai Baba had predicted that he would die at age 96 and would remain healthy until then.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Redemptive Encounters: Three Modern Styles in the Hindu Tradition|last=Babb|first=Lawrence A.|publisher=University of California Press|year=1991|isbn=0-520-07636-2|location=|page=166|quote=His present incarnation, he says, ... He will die at the age of ninety-six, but his body will stay young until then.}}&lt;/ref&gt; After he died, some devotees suggested that he was referring to that many [[lunar calendar|lunar years]], as counted by Telugu-speaking Hindus, rather than [[tropical year|solar years]],&lt;ref&gt;Mohammed Shafeeq. However it was soon  clearly shown that the lunar reckoning does not work.  Post. Durban: 27 April 2011. pg. 4&lt;/ref&gt; and using the [[hindu calendar|Indian way]] of [[Ageing#Cultural variations|accounting for age]], which counts the year to come as part of the person's life.&lt;ref&gt;Sri Philip M. Prasad, Malayalam Daily. Kerala, India: 25 April 2011. "What Baba has foretold was indeed correct. According to the Roman calendar he has completed 85 years. But one can note that generally in all of Baba's discourses Baba had been referring to the star (lunar) basis in calculations. In Indian astrology there are 27 stars in a month starting with Aswathy and ending with Revathy. Accordingly a year of 12 months is composed of 324 days. Sai Baba was born on 23 November 1925. From that day till his death day 24 April 2011 there were a total of 33,899 days. If this is divided with 324, we get 95 years and 54 days. Accordingly, under the star basis of calculation he was in his 96th year having completed 54 days when he left his physical body."&lt;/ref&gt; Other devotees have spoken of his anticipated [[resurrection]], [[reincarnation]] or [[wakefulness|awakening]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Hindustan Times'', New Delhi: 25 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Narayan |first1=Sreejith |title=Sai, Thy Kingdom Come | year = 2012| isbn = 978-1-62314-842-3 | url =http://www.saikingdom.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cash was deposited into the Sai Trust's account at the State Bank of India with payment of government taxes (thus transferring them from religious gifts to Trust assets.) The gold and other items were inventoried, assessed, and placed in secure storage. In July, district authorities inventoried an additional Rs 7.7&amp;nbsp;million (US$0.17m) in valuables in another 4 rooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-07-03/india/29733031_1_satya-sai-baba-precious-metals-diamond-ring |title=Assets worth Rs 77L seized at Sai ashram | newspaper=Times of India | date=3 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The total value of these items is believed to exceed 7.8 million US dollars.&lt;ref name="hindustan times"&gt;{{cite news|title=Treasure island: Sai Baba's gold trove|publisher=[[Press Trust of India]]|date=17 June 2011|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Treasure-island-Sai-Baba-s-gold-trove/Article1-710596.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Satyajit Sailan also attached the attestation of Indulal Sha, who is the sole surviving witness to the original document.

{{Main|Sathya Sai Organisation}}
The Sathya Sai Organisation (or Sri Sathya Sai [[Selfless service|Seva]] Organization) was founded in the 1960s by Sai Baba.&lt;ref name="srisaiorg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.srisathyasai.org.in/Pages/Sai_Organisations/Sai_Organisations.htm|title=SSSCT- Sri Sathya Sai Seva Organisation|work=srisathyasai.org.in}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Sai Centres were started in India under the name of the "Sri Sathya Sai Seva Samithi".&lt;ref name="saiindia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saibabaofindia.com/sai_baba_centers.htm|title=Sai Baba Of India-Sri Sathya Sai Baba Centers- Sai Baba organisation worldwide|work=saibabaofindia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Sathya Sai Organisation originated "to enable its members to undertake service activities as a means to spiritual advancement."&lt;ref name="srisaiorg"/&gt; The official mission of the Sathya Sai Organization is "to help its members realize the innate divinity within".

The Sathya Sai Organisation publishes an official monthly magazine named ''[[Sanathana Sarathi (magazine)|Sanathana Sarathi]]'', published by the Sri Sathya Sai Books and Publications Trust.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Sanathana-Sarathi-(magazine) Sanathana Sarathi magazine: Latest News, Videos and Photos of Sanathana Sarathi magazine]. Times of India.&lt;/ref&gt; The English translation of the word Sanathana Sarathi means 'Eternal Charioteer'.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

Sai Baba stated that the main objective of the Sathya Sai Organisation "is to help man recognize the divinity that is inherent in him. So, your duty is to emphasize the One, to experience the One in all you do or speak. Do not give any importance to differences of religion or sect or status or colour. Have the feeling of one-ness permeate every act of yours. Only those who do so have a place in this Organization; the rest can withdraw."&lt;ref&gt;Sathya Sai Baba Sathya Sai Speaks IX, 35, 187–188 (old edition)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sathyasai-se.org/|title=Sathya Sai Baba Avatar Sweden Sverige|work=sathyasai-se.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Telugu-Ganga Project'''

The Telugu-Ganga project is a water supply scheme implemented by [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[India]] to provide drinking water to [[Chennai]] city in [[Tamil Nadu]]. The source of water is the river Krishna in Andhra Pradesh and the Poondi reservoir near Chennai is the destination with water planned to be routed through a series of interlinked canals.

The water initially supplied by the canal was disappointing, delivering less than 500 million cubic feet (14×10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;). In 2002, Sri Sathya Sai Baba announced a scheme of restoration and lining of the canal; as his own undertaking. With an extensive rebuilding of the canal and several reservoirs, the project was completed in 2004, when Poondi reservoir received Krishna water for the first time.&lt;sup&gt;[[Telugu Ganga project#cite note-2|[2]]]&lt;/sup&gt; The supply of water to Chennai city in 2006 was 3.7 billion cubic feet (100×10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;sup&gt;[[Telugu Ganga project#cite note-3|[3]]]&lt;/sup&gt; After the re-lining and reconstruction, the Kandaleru-Poondi part of the canal was renamed Sai Ganga.&lt;sup&gt;[[Telugu Ganga project#cite note-4|[4]]][[Telugu Ganga project#cite note-5|[5]]][[Telugu Ganga project#cite note-6|[6]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

Followers believed in seeking the spiritual benefit of Sai Baba's ''[[darsana|darshan]]'', scheduled for morning and afternoon each day. Sai Baba would interact with people, accept letters, materialise and distribute [[vibhuti]] (sacred ash) or call groups or individuals for interviews. Devotees considered it a great privilege to have an interview and sometimes a single person, group or family was invited for a private interview for answers to spiritual questions and general guidance.&lt;ref name="kent"/&gt;

== Controversies ==
=== Criticism ===
Accusations&lt;!-- Please do not change this wording, this has been agreed on the talk page. If you don't agree on it read the discussion there. --&gt; against Sai Baba by his critics over the years have included sleight of hand, sexual abuse, money laundering, fraud in the performance of service projects, and murder.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Palmer116/&gt;

In 1972 [[Abraham Kovoor]] made the first public criticism of Sai Baba&lt;ref name="srisathyasaibabaandthepress"&gt;Ruhela S.P., ''Sri Sathya Sai Baba and the Press'', pp. 1–5, 1997 {{ISBN|81-7533-041-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; when he looked into a claim publicly narrated by one devotee&lt;ref name="srisathyasaibabaandthepress" /&gt; that Sai Baba had created a new model of a [[Seiko]] watch, and found the claim to be untrue.&lt;ref name="sathyasaibabasgrace"&gt;Ruhela S.P., ''How to Receive Sri Sathya Sai Baba's Grace'', pp. 277, 2006 {{ISBN|81-7182-089-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OutlookSingh&gt;{{cite web|title=The Spell Breaker|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?262445|publisher=Outlook|accessdate=16 October 2013|author=Rahul Singh|date=2 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1976, [[Hosur Narasimhaiah|Hossur Narasimhaiah]], a physicist, rationalist and then vice-chancellor of [[Bangalore University]], founded and chaired a committee "to rationally and scientifically investigate miracles and other verifiable superstitions". Narasimhaiah wrote Sai Baba three widely publicised letters challenging him to perform his miracles under controlled conditions. The letters were ignored.&lt;ref name="haraldsson204"&gt;Haraldson, ''op. cit'', pp&amp;nbsp;204–205&lt;/ref&gt; Sai Baba said that he ignored Narasimhaiah's challenge because he felt his approach was improper, adding that "Science must confine its inquiry only to things belonging to the human senses, while spiritualism transcends the senses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Satya Sai Baba and His Miracles|publisher=The Chakra|url=http://www.chakranews.com/satya-sai-baba-and-his-miracles/3543}}&lt;/ref&gt; If you want to understand the nature of spiritual power you can do so only through the path of spirituality and not science.

Karanjia]] of ''Blitz'' news magazine in September 1976 [http://www.saibaba.ws/articles/interviewwithjournalistsept1976.htm Available online]&lt;/ref&gt; Narasimhaiah's committee was dissolved in August 1977. According to [[Erlendur Haraldsson]], the committee's formal challenge came to a dead end because of its negative attitude and perhaps because of the fanfare surrounding it. Narasimhaiah held the fact that  Sai Baba ignored his letters to be one of several indications that his miracles were fraudulent.&lt;ref&gt;Haraldsson, pp 209&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this episode, a public debate raged for several months in Indian newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;Haraldsson, ''op. cit.'', pp. 206&lt;/ref&gt;

Indian rationalist [[Basava Premanand]], who began campaigning against Sai Baba in 1976, unsuccessfully attempted to sue him in 1986 for violations of the [[Gold Control Act]], citing Sai Baba's purported materialisations of gold objects. When the case was dismissed, Premanand unsuccessfully appealed on the grounds that claimed spiritual power is not a defence recognised in law.&lt;ref name=bbca1&gt;{{cite news|author=Tanya Datta|title=Sai Baba: Goan or con man?|date=17 June 2004|work=[[BBC News]] |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/this_world/3813469.stm | accessdate=4 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1995 TV documentary ''Guru Busters'', produced by filmmaker [[Robert Eagle (writer and director)|Robert Eagle]] for the UK's [[Channel 4]], accused Sai Baba of faking his materialisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eagletv.co.uk/home/guru.htm |title=Eagle &amp; Eagle |publisher=Eagletv.co.uk |date= |accessdate=7 January 2010}} [http://www.eagletv.co.uk/home/videos/Saimagic.mov Clip]&lt;/ref&gt; The clip from the film was mentioned in the ''[[Deccan Chronicle]]'', on 23 November 1992, in a front-page headline "DD Tape Unveils Baba Magic".&lt;ref&gt;Haraldsson, ''op. cit.'', pp.&amp;nbsp;295–301&lt;/ref&gt; But Haraldsson stated that, on investigating the DD video, researchers did not find evidence of fake materialisation. According to Haraldsson, the video was taken to a company that investigates corporate fraud, which found that it did not provide firm evidence of sleight of hand.&lt;ref&gt;Haraldsson, ''op. cit.'', pp 300, 295–301&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, British journalist Mick Brown stated in his book ''The Spiritual Tourist'' that in his opinion claims of Sai Baba resurrecting American devotee Walter Cowan in 1971 were probably untrue.&lt;ref name="spiritualtourist"&gt;Mick Brown, ''The Spiritual Tourist'', 1998, Bloomsbury Publishing, {{ISBN|1-58234-034-X}} "In the House of God", pp.&amp;nbsp;73–74&lt;/ref&gt; His opinion was based on letters from the attending doctors presented in the magazine ''[[Indian Skeptic]]'', published by Basava Premanand.&lt;ref name="spiritualtourist"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hislop, John S. ''My Baba and I'' 1985 published by Birth Day Publishing Company, San Diego, California {{ISBN|0-9600958-8-8}}, "The Resurrection of Walter Cowan", pages&amp;nbsp;28–31&lt;/ref&gt; Brown also related, in the same book, his experiences with manifestations of ''vibuthi'' from Sai Baba's pictures in houses in London, which he felt were not fraudulent or the result of trickery.&lt;ref name="touristmiracle"&gt;Brown Mick, ''The Spiritual Tourist'', "The Miracle in North London", pp.&amp;nbsp;29–30, 1998 {{ISBN|158234034X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown wrote with regards to Sai Baba's claims of omniscience, that "sceptics have produced documentation clearly showing discrepancies between Baba's reading of historical events and biblical prophecies, and the established accounts."&lt;ref name="spiritualtourist"/&gt;

===Claims of sexual abuse===
In January 2002, a documentary produced by Denmark's national television and radio broadcast company, [[Danish radio|Danmarks Radio]] (DR), named ''Seduced By Sai Baba'', analysed videos of public manifestations of Sai Baba, and suggested that they could be explained as [[sleight of hand]].&lt;ref name="seduced"&gt;{{cite video|people=Øyvind Kyrø, Steen Jensen |title=Seduced by Sai Baba |medium=Documentary |publisher=[[DR (broadcaster)|DR]] |date=2002 |time= |url=http://dr.dk/Salg/DRsales/Programmes/Documentary/Society_and_Social/20070629133445_3_1_3_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100204010039/http://www.dr.dk/Salg/DRsales/Programmes/Documentary/Society_and_Social/20070629133445_3_1_3_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1_1.htm |archivedate=4 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The documentary also presented interviews with Alaya Rahm, former devotee of the cult, where he alleged sexual abuse by Sai Baba.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt; As a result, in 2002 the Parliament of the United Kingdom discussed the possible danger to male children of British families intending to visit the ashram of Sathya Sai Baba in case of individual audiences with the guru.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/edm/2001-02/886] UK Parliament official web site&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the [[BBC]] produced a documentary titled ''The Secret Swami'', as part of its series "The World Uncovered".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/this_world/3791921.stm |title=Programmes &amp;#124; This World &amp;#124; Secret Swami |publisher=BBC News |date=11 June 2004 |accessdate=7 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; One central theme of the BBC documentary was again Alaya Rahm's sexual abuse allegations against Sai Baba.&lt;ref name=bbcd&gt;{{cite video|people=Eamon Hardy, Tanya Datta|title=Secret Swami|medium=Documentary|publisher=BBC News|date=2004 |time= |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/this_world/3791921.stm | accessdate=4 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This documentary interviewed him together with Mark Roche, who had spent 25 years of his life since 1969 in the movement and alleged abuse by Sai Baba.&lt;ref name=bbcd/&gt; The show also featured allegations from Sai Baba critic Basava Premanand. Premanand stated in the documentary that, in his opinion, Sai Baba faked his materialisations. Here, he claimed that Sai Baba was "not just a fraud, but a dangerous sexual abuser". According to his interview, he had stories which spanned 30 years, and he stated that his stories were similar, a common practice being the rubbing of genitals with oil by the spiritual leader. Among his claims were that one ex-devotee claimed Sai Baba "put the oil on his hands, told me to drop my pants and rubbed my genitals with the oil". Premanand theorised that many Indian boys were abused but were never heard from because they were too afraid to speak out, alleging Sai Baba was well-connected with the elite and powerful of India.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt;

===Responses===
Sai Baba and his followers reject any allegations of misconduct.&lt;ref name=funeral/&gt; Devotee [[Bill Aitken (traveller)|Bill Aitken]] was quoted by ''[[The Week]]'' as saying that Sai Baba's reputation had not been harmed by the negative stories published about him. He said that the more detractors railed against Sai Baba, the more new devotees went to see him.&lt;ref&gt;Aitken, Bill (27 November 2005),{{cite web|url=http://www.the-week.com/25nov27/currentevents_article10.htm |title=Miracle of Welfare |accessdate=9 September 2006 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060909111636/http://www.the-week.com/25nov27/currentevents_article10.htm |archivedate=9 September 2006  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the article ''Divine Downfall'', published in the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'', Anil Kumar, the ex-principal of the Sathya Sai Educational Institute, said that he believed that the controversy was part of Baba's divine plan and that all great religious teachers had to face criticism during their lives. Anil Kumar also said that allegations had been levelled at Sai Baba since childhood, but with every criticism he had become more and more triumphant.&lt;ref name="divine"&gt;Brown, Mick (28 October 2000). "Divine Downfall". Daily Telegraph.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book ''Redemptive Encounters: Three Modern Styles in the Hindu Tradition'', Lawrence A. Babb wrote of Sai Baba, "Whoever he is, he is certainly more than the mere parlour magician many of his critics claim that he is."&lt;ref name="BabbLawrence"/&gt;

Sai Baba publicly responded to the allegations on 25 December 2000:
{{quote|Some people out of their mean-mindedness are trying to tarnish the image of Sai Baba. I am not after name and fame. So, I do not lose anything by their false allegations. My glory will go on increasing day by day. It will never diminish even a bit if they were to publicise their false allegations in the whole world in bold letters. Some devotees seem to be perturbed over these false statements. They are not true devotees at all. Having known the mighty power of Sai, why should they be afraid of the 'cawing of crows'? One should not get carried away by all that is written on walls, said in political meetings or the vulgar tales carried by the print media.&lt;ref&gt;Sathya Sai Speaks Vol.33, pg.389&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''[[The Times of India]]'' on 26 December 2000 quoted Sai Baba as saying: {{quote|[[Jesus Christ]] underwent many hardships, and was put to the cross because of jealousy. Many around him could not bear the good work he did and the large number of followers he gathered. One of his disciples, [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]], betrayed him. In those days there was one Judas, but today there are thousands. Just as that Judas was tempted to betray Jesus, the Judases of today, too, are bought out to lie. Jealousy was the motive behind the allegations levelled at him.&lt;ref&gt;Rao, Manu (26 December 2000), Sai Baba lashes out at detractors http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bangalore/sai-baba-lashes-out-at-detractors/articleshow/534425761.cms&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Section 2''' of the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]'' ("''Charter''") is the section of the [[Constitution of Canada]] that lists what the ''Charter'' calls "fundamental freedoms" theoretically applying to everyone in Canada, regardless of whether they are a Canadian citizen, or an individual or [[corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/const/page-15.html#s-2. | title = Constitution Acts, 1867 to 1982 | accessdate = 2014-02-15 | author = Justice Laws Website, Site Web de la législation (Justice) | date = 2014-01-30 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140119183913/http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/const/page-15.html | archivedate = 2014-01-19 | quote = Everyone has the following fundamental freedoms}}&lt;/ref&gt; These freedoms can be held against actions of all levels of government and are enforceable by the courts. The fundamental freedoms are [[freedom of speech|freedom of expression]], [[freedom of religion]], [[freedom of thought]], [[freedom of belief]], [[freedom of assembly|freedom of peaceful assembly]] and [[freedom of association]].

[[Section One of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 1]] of the ''Charter'' permits Parliament or the provincial legislatures to enact laws that place certain kinds of limited restrictions on the freedoms listed under section 2. Additionally, these freedoms can be temporarily invalidated by [[Section Thirty-three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 33]], the "not with standing clause", of the ''Charter''.

As a part of the ''Charter'' and of the larger ''[[Constitution Act, 1982]]'', section 2 took legal effect on April 17, 1982. However, many of its rights have roots in Canada in the 1960 ''[[Canadian Bill of Rights]]'' (although this law was of limited effectiveness), and in traditions under a theorized [[Implied Bill of Rights]]. Many of these exemptions, such as freedom of expression, have also been at the centre of [[Canadian federalism|federalistic]] disputes.

==Text==
Under the heading of "Fundamental Freedoms" the section states:
{{quote|2.  Everyone has the following fundamental freedoms:

(a) freedom of conscience and religion;

(b) freedom of thought, belief, opinion and expression, including freedom of the press and other media of communication;

(c) freedom of peaceful assembly; and

(d) freedom of association.}}

==Freedom of religion==
{{see also|Freedom of religion in Canada}}

===Background===
According to [[Beverley McLachlin]], freedom of religion in Canada may have originated as early as 1759, when [[French Canadian]] [[Roman Catholic]]s were allowed rights of worship by their British conquerors; this was later reconfirmed in 1774 in the ''[[Quebec Act]]''. Later the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]]'' provided for denominational school rights&lt;ref&gt;Beverley McLachlin, "Freedom of Religion and the Rule of Law:  A Canadian Perspective," in ''Recognizing Religion in a Secular Society: Essays in Pluralism, Religion, and Public Policy''. Ed. Douglas Farrow. McGill-Queen's University Press, 2004, pages 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt; (these are reaffirmed by [[Section Twenty-nine of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 29 of the ''Charter'']]). Discussions of church-state relations also took place in the [[Guibord case]] of 1874. In 1955, the Supreme Court ruled in ''Chaput v Romain'',&lt;ref&gt;[1955] SCR 834.&lt;/ref&gt; regarding [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], that different religions have rights, based upon tradition and the [[rule of law]] (at the time no statutes formed the basis for this argument).&lt;ref&gt;McLachlin, "Freedom of Religion and the Rule of Law:  A Canadian Perspective," pages 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious freedom was later included in the ''Canadian Bill of Rights''.  However, its effectiveness was limited. When Sunday closing laws compelling respect for the [[Sabbath in Christianity|Christian Sabbath]] were challenged in ''R v Robertson and Rosetanni'',&lt;ref&gt;[1963] SCR 651&lt;/ref&gt; Justice Ritchie of the Supreme Court found that non-Christians merely lost money when denied rights to work on Sunday and were otherwise free to believe in and observe their own religions.

===Definition===
Freedom of religion under section 2(a) of the ''Charter'' was first seriously considered by the Supreme Court in ''[[R v Big M Drug Mart Ltd]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[1985] 1 SCR 295.&lt;/ref&gt; In that case, Chief Justice Brian Dickson wrote that this freedom at least includes freedom of religious speech, including "the right to entertain such religious beliefs as a person chooses, the right to declare religious beliefs openly and without fear of hindrance or reprisal, and the right to manifest religious belief by worship and practice or by teaching and dissemination." Freedom of religion would also prohibit imposing religious requirements. The immediate consequence of section 2, in this case, was the abolishment of federal Sunday closing laws.

In ''[[Syndicat Northcrest v Amselem]]'',&lt;ref&gt;2004 SCC 47.&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court drew up a definition of freedom of religion under the ''[[Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms]]'', mindful of the overlap with section 2(a). The majority found freedom of religion encompasses a right to religious practices if the individual has a sincere belief that the practice is connected to religion.  It would not matter whether the practice was needed according to religious authority.  If courts can believe an individual is telling the truth in saying a practice is connected to religion, the courts then ask whether the infringement of freedom of religion is severe enough to trigger section 2. The Court also said religious beliefs are vacillating, so courts trying to determine an individual belief should be mindful that beliefs may change. Following this test in ''[[Multani v Commission scolaire Marguerite‑Bourgeoys]]'',&lt;ref&gt;2006 SCC 6.&lt;/ref&gt; the Court found freedom of religion should protect a non-violent [[Sikh]] student's right to wear a ''[[kirpan]]'' (dagger) in school.

In ''R v NS'',&lt;ref&gt;2012 SCC 72.&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court sought to find a middle ground on the issue of whether a witness can wear a face-covering [[niqāb]] while testifying in a criminal trial. The court found that the right to religious freedom must be balanced against the right of the accused to a fair trial.

===Freedom of conscience===
In addition to freedom of religion, section 2(a) also guarantees freedom of conscience. Professor [[Peter Hogg]] speculated this would include a right to [[atheism]], despite the [[preamble to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], which recognizes the "supremacy of God".&lt;ref&gt;Hogg, Peter W.  ''Canada Act 1982 Annotated.''  Toronto, Canada:  The Carswell Company Limited, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; The right has not spawned a great deal of case law, although Justice [[Bertha Wilson]] did rely on it in her opinion in ''[[R v Morgentaler]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[1998] 1 SCR 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Finding laws against abortion to be a breach of the rights to [[liberty]] and [[security of the person]] under [[Section Seven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 7 of the ''Charter'']], Wilson then argued this infringement could not be justified as being consistent with [[fundamental justice]]. The legal protections found under fundamental justice could be defined as including other rights under the ''Charter'', and in particular abortion laws breached freedom of conscience. As she wrote, the "decision whether or not to terminate a pregnancy is essentially a moral decision, a matter of conscience". She then said, "[C]onscientious beliefs which are not religiously motivated are equally protected by freedom of conscience in s. 2(a)." No other judges joined Wilson's opinion.

[[Jean Chrétien]], who was the [[Attorney General of Canada|attorney general]] during negotiations of the ''Charter'', later recalled in his memoirs that freedom of conscience was nearly excluded from the ''Charter''. The federal and provincial negotiators found the right too difficult to define, and Chrétien eventually agreed to remove it. A legal advisor for the federal government, Pierre Genest, then kicked Chrétien's chair, prompting Chrétien to joke, "I guess we leave it in. [[Pierre Trudeau|Trudeau's]] spy just kicked me in the ass."&lt;ref&gt;Chrétien, Jean. ''Straight from the Heart''. (Key Porter Books Limited, 1994), p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freedom of expression==
{{see|History of free speech in Canada}}
Freedom of expression, section 2(b), is perhaps one of the most significant ''Charter'' rights in influencing Canadian society.  The right is expressly named in the charter because although "Canadian criminal law uses the standard of the [[reasonable person]] as a&amp;nbsp;... definition for the threshold of criminality", the ''Charter'' expressly limits some forms of expression.&lt;ref&gt;Mikus, Rudolf Alexander. (1995). The reasonable person in substantive Canadian Criminal Law (T). Retrieved from https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/831/items/1.0077473&lt;/ref&gt;  Justice [[Peter Cory]] wrote that it "is difficult to imagine a guaranteed right more important to a democratic society".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Edmonton Journal v Alberta (AG)]]'', [1989] 2 SCR 1326 at 1336.&lt;/ref&gt;  The section has been at the centre of a great amount of case law.

===Background===
Freedom of speech had a limited background in Canada. It has been an issue in federalism disputes, as provincial legislation infringing upon free speech has been taken as criminal legislation, which only the [[Parliament of Canada]] can validly create under section 91(27) of the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]]''.  ''[[Switzman v Elbling]]''&lt;ref&gt;[1957] SCR 285.&lt;/ref&gt; is an example of a case in which this was discussed. An Implied Bill of Rights theory further stated governments were limited in their abilities to infringe upon free speech by virtue of the [[preamble]] of the ''Constitution Act, 1867''. This preamble states Canada's constitution would be based upon Britain's, and Britain had limited free speech in 1867.  Furthermore, free speech is considered to be necessary for a parliamentary government to function.&lt;ref&gt;Hogg, Peter W. ''Constitutional Law of Canada''. 2003 Student Ed. (Scarborough, Ontario: Thomson Canada Limited, 2003), p. 686.&lt;/ref&gt;

Free speech was later included in the ''Canadian Bill of Rights''.

===Definition===
The meaning of "expression" within section 2(b) has been read broadly as including any activity that conveys, or attempts to convey, meaning&lt;ref&gt;''[[Irwin Toy Ltd v Quebec (AG)]]'', [1989] 1 SCR 927 [''Irwin Toy''].&lt;/ref&gt; to the exception of acts of violence and threats of violence.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Ibid'' and ''[[United Food and Commercial Workers, Local 1518 v KMart Canada Ltd]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Courts have tried to maintain content neutrality by not considering the value of the expression. Instead, the content is only examined during the section 1 analysis.

Freedom of expression is primarily seen as a [[negative and positive rights|negative right]]. In ''[[Native Women's Assn of Canada v Canada|Native Women's Association of Canada v Canada]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[1994] 3 SCR 627.&lt;/ref&gt; the Court considered a claim that the government had to financially support an interest group in constitutional negotiations, as it had supported others. [[Section Twenty-eight of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 28]] (sexual equality under the ''Charter'') was used to reinforce this argument, since the rights claimants were an interest group. Still, while the Supreme Court agreed discussions with the government is "unquestionably" a form of expression, the government did not seem to be guilty of suppressing any expression and thus the claim was dismissed.

===Limiting the right===
A law will be found to violate the freedom of expression where the law either has the purpose or effect of violating the right.

A law's purpose can limit the right either through limiting the content or form of expression. Limits on content are where the meaning of the expression is specifically forbidden by the law, such as hate-speech law, and is the most easily identifiable form of limitation.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. ''[[Prostitution Reference|Reference Re ss 193 &amp; 195.1(1)(c) of Criminal Code (Canada)]]'', [1990] 1 SCR 1123 [''Prostitution Reference'']; ''[[R v Keegstra]]'', [1990] 3 SCR 697; and ''[[R v Butler]]'', [1992] 1 SCR 452.&lt;/ref&gt; Limiting the form of the expression can often invoke section 2(b) as it will often have the effect of limiting the content as well.&lt;ref&gt;For example, instead of banning [[rock music]] (the content), banning [[FM radio]] (the method of conveying the music).&lt;/ref&gt;

Where a law does not intend to limit the freedom of expression it may still infringe section 2(b) through its effects.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ramsden v Peterborough (City of)]]'', [1993] 2 SCR 1084.&lt;/ref&gt; A law will be found to restrict expression if it has the effect of frustrating "the pursuit of [[truth]], participation in the community, or individual self-fulfillment and human flourishing".

===Commercial expression===
Commercial expression is recognized as an activity protected under section 2(b). This includes advertising and any other similar means of expression used to sell goods and services. In fact, even false or misleading advertising is protected. The value of the expression does not come into play until the section 1 analysis.

The protection of commercial expression was first established in ''[[Ford v Quebec (AG)]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[1988] 2 SCR 712.&lt;/ref&gt; where the Court struck down a Quebec law requiring all signs to be exclusively in French. This was soon followed by ''Irwin Toy'',&lt;ref&gt;''Supra''.&lt;/ref&gt; where the Court found that Quebec law prohibiting advertising to children to violate section 2(b) but was saved under section 1.

The Supreme Court has also found that restrictions on advertising by professionals to be protected.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Rocket v Royal College of Dental Surgeons of Ontario]]'', [1990] 2 SCR 232.&lt;/ref&gt; As well, even communications for the purpose of prostitution was found to be protected as commercial expression.&lt;ref&gt;''Prostitution Reference'', ''supra''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Picketing===
Protesting by labour groups and trade unions have long been recognized as a protected form of expression.

There are not many instances of limiting primary picketing. Typically, the debate has been over whether [[secondary picketing]] can be restricted; the practice of picketing businesses not directly involved in a labour dispute has in the past been banned under the common law. The most significant decision on limiting primary picketing is ''[[British Columbia Government Employees' Union v British Columbia (AG)]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[1988] 2 SCR 214.&lt;/ref&gt; where employees at the [[British Columbia Supreme Court]], who were protesting as part of a province-wide public service employee strike, were ordered back to work by the Chief Justice of the court. The order was found to clearly violate section 2(b) but the Supreme Court upheld it on section 1.

===Freedom of thought, belief and opinion===
Section 2(b) guarantees freedom of thought, belief and opinion in addition to freedom of expression. However, some have argued that freedoms of thought, belief and opinion in the ''Charter'' have had little practical consequence, and question whether governments have the capacity to stifle unspoken thoughts in any case.&lt;ref&gt;Hogg, Peter W. Constitutional Law of Canada. 2003 Student Ed. (Scarborough, Ontario: Thomson Canada Limited, 2003), p. 917.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Application in the civil context===
The need to protect freedom of expression is considered a guiding principle of interpretation in civil cases between individuals. In '' Crookes v. Newton'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chartercases.com/crookes-v-newton-2011-scc-47/]&lt;/ref&gt; for example, the Supreme Court of Canada found that section 2(b) must be considered in determining the extent to which common law libel restrictions should apply to new technologies such as internet hyperlinks.

==Freedom of peaceful assembly==
[[File:Occupy Montreal - Global Day of Action - 2011-10-15 - Victoria Square - General assembly.jpg|250px|thumb|right|[[Occupy Canada]] stages a peaceful assembly in Victoria Square in Montreal.]] 
Freedom of peaceful assembly under section 2(c) has not had a major impact on the case law.  In ''[[Reference Re Public Service Employee Relations Act (Alta)]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[1987] 1 SCR 313 [''Alberta Reference''].&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court found that despite being written as a separate right, it was closely related to freedom of expression. The [[Nova Scotia Supreme Court]] defined it in ''Fraser et al v AGNS et al'' (1986) as including rights to meet as part of a committee or as workers. If there are membership fees to attend a meeting, prohibitions on being able to spend money for membership would be an abridgement of the right to peaceful assembly. In 2011, [[Occupy Canada]]'s protests in public parks raised questions of whether their eviction was prohibited by freedom of assembly, as well as expression and association.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Gollom, "[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2011/11/17/occupy-protest-rights.html Will charter protect Occupy protesters from eviction?]", CBC News, 18 November 2011, URL accessed 18 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freedom of association==
Freedom of association is guaranteed under section 2(d). This right provides individuals the right to establish, belong to and maintain to any sort of organization, unless that organization is otherwise illegal. Generally, this is used in the [[Labour movement|labour]] context where employees are given the right to associate with certain [[trade union|unions]] or other similar group to represent their interests in labour disputes or negotiations.

It is important to note that this right only protects the right of individuals to form associations and not associations themselves.&lt;ref&gt;''Alberta Reference'', ''supra''.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, government legislation affecting the powers of established labour associations do not necessarily invoke section 2(d). It is only where legislation restricts the associative nature of an activity will section 2 be invoked. However, in the landmark ''Health Services and Support – Facilities Subsector Bargaining Association v British Columbia'',&lt;ref&gt;2007 SCC 27 [''Health Services''].&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court ruled that freedom of association guaranteed by section 2(d) includes a procedural right to collective bargaining. The Court ruled in this case that legislation that "substantially interferes" with the process of collective bargaining is a section 2(d) infringement. The test for "substantial interference" is twofold: (1) the importance of the matter affected to the process of collective bargaining, and more specifically, the capacity of union members to come together and pursue collective goals in concert; and (2) the manner in which the measure impacts on the collective right to good faith negotiation and consultation.&lt;ref&gt;''Health Services'', ''supra'' at 394.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not certain whether the decision in ''Health Services'' overturns jurisprudence arising from the so-called "labour trilogy" cases of 1987 which found that section 2(d) did not include a right to collective bargaining.&lt;ref&gt;''Health Services'', ''supra'' at 413.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Supreme Court has since found in ''Ontario (AG) v Fraser'',&lt;ref&gt;2011 SCC 20 [''Fraser''].&lt;/ref&gt; that the right to collective bargaining does not require government to take an active role in promoting and fostering collective bargaining, but merely to refrain from excessive interference with the collective bargaining process. In effect, the right to collective bargaining "guarantees a process, not a result". ''Fraser'' was affirmed and expanded upon by the [[Court of Appeal for Ontario]] in 2012 in ''Association of Justice Counsel v Canada (AG)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Association of Justice Counsel v. Canada (Attorney General)|link=Association of Justice Counsel v. Canada (Attorney General)|year=2012|court=onca|num=530|format=onca|courtname=auto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, where a union is denied a right it does not preclude the employees from forming a separate association. In ''[[Delisle v Canada (Deputy AG)]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[1999] 2 SCR 989.&lt;/ref&gt; members of the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] were excluded from the public services legislation. The Supreme Court held that they were not precluded from forming their own association outside of the impugned legislation. However, in contrast the decision of ''[[Dunmore v Ontario (AG)]]''&lt;ref&gt;2001 SCC 94.&lt;/ref&gt; indicated that agricultural workers who were excluded from provincial labour relations legislation were entitled to be included because individually they were unable to form their own associations, and consequently, this imposed a duty upon the government to include them.

The freedom of association also includes the freedom not to associate.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Lavigne v Ontario Public Service Employees Union]]'', [1991] 2 SCR 211 [''Lavigne''].&lt;/ref&gt; In certain employment circumstances, employees are required to contribute to a union as conditions of their employment (see [[Rand formula]]). However, mandatory associations do not invoke section 2(d) in and of themselves. In ''Lavigne'', the Court found that the right not to be associated extended only to where the association supported causes that went beyond what is necessary for employee representation. More generally, the Supreme Court had stated that the right is violated only when the mandatory association imposes "ideological conformity".&lt;ref&gt;''R v Advance Cutting &amp; Coring Ltd'', 2001 SCC 70 [''Advance Cutting &amp; Coring''].&lt;/ref&gt; Such violations have also mostly been found by the Supreme Court to be justified under [[Section One of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 1]], resulting in a right not to associate that has more theoretical than practical effects.

In ''Advance Cutting &amp; Coring'',&lt;ref&gt;''Supra''.&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court was called to examine the constitutional validity of a Quebec law that required all persons working in the province's construction industry to join a designated union. Eight of nine judges (Justice [[Claire L'Heureux-Dubé]] dissenting) confirmed that section 2 includes, to at least some degree, the negative right to ''not'' associate. With a majority of five judges to four, the Court determined that the law at issue violated this right. But with the same majority (judge [[Frank Iacobucci]] "switching camps" on the two issues and citing a "unique and complex historical context" in Quebec), the Court deemed the law to be ''justified in a free and democratic society'' under section 1 and thus constitutional.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1546">'''Singleness of [[Heart (symbol)|heart]]''' (also called '''singleheartedness''') is the ideal of having sole devotion to a task or endeavour.  It is normally employed in a religious or spiritual context.  In antiquity it was thought of as a counteraction to the divisive effects of civilization on the soul.  It is especially associated with the practices of [[Christian monasticism]].

Referring to the desert landscape inhabited by the earliest Christian monks, [[Peter Brown (historian)|Peter Brown]], in ''A History of Private Life'', explains:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The bleak, asocial landscape of the desert was a distant image of Paradise -- the first, the true home of humankind, where Adam and Eve had dwelt in full majesty, before the subtle and overpowering onset of the doublehearted cares of human life in settled society, before marriage, physical greed, the labor of the earth, and the grinding cares of present human society robbed them of their original serenity.  Totally singlehearted, therefore joined with the angelic hosts in unfailing and undivided praise of God, the life of the monk mirrored on earth the life of the angels.  &lt;small&gt;(''Paul Veyne, editor. Harvard: 1987. Volume I, p. 289'')&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Søren Kierkegaard expressed a similar concept in his maxim "Purity of heart is to will one thing" and his sermon-form essay bearing that title.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.enotes.com/topics/purity-heart-will-one-thing&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2506">The '''Sirotci''' ("Orphans"; {{lang-de|Waisen}}), officially '''Orphans' Union''' ({{lang-cz|Sirotčí svaz}}), were followers of a radical wing of the [[Hussites]] in [[Crown of Bohemia|Bohemia]]. This force, founded in 1423 originally under the name '''Lesser [[Tábor]]''', consisted mostly of poorer burghers and some members of the lower aristocracy, who joined with commander [[Jan Žižka]] and the eastern Bohemian Hussites, the so-called [[Orebites]] (''Orebité'').

After the Žižka's death (1424) "orphaned" combatants adopted their new name. From 1424 till 1428 they were led by the priest Ambrož of [[Hradec Králové|Hradec]], subsequently by another priest [[Prokop the Lesser]]. ''[[Hejtman]]'' [[Jan Čapek of Sány]] was elected as their military commander (1431–34).

'''''Skeptic''''', colloquially known as '''''Skeptic magazine''''', is a quarterly [[science education]] and science advocacy [[magazine]] published internationally by [[The Skeptics Society]], a [[nonprofit]] organization devoted to promoting [[scientific skepticism]] and resisting the spread of [[pseudoscience]], [[superstition]], and [[irrationality|irrational]] beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skeptic.com/about_us/what_we_do/ |title=What We Do |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher=Skeptic (U.S. magazine) |access-date=March 5, 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founded by [[Michael Shermer]], founder of the Skeptics Society,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skeptic.com/about_us/meet_michael_shermer.html "Meet Michael Shermer"]. ''Skeptic''. Retrieved March 5, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; the magazine was first published in the spring of 1992 and is published through Millennium Press.
Shermer remains the Publisher and [[Editor-in-Chief]] of the magazine and the magazine’s Co-publisher and [[Art Director]] is Pat Linse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skeptic.com/the_magazine/masthead.html |title=Masthead, ''Skeptic'' Magazine. |accessdate=1 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other noteworthy members of its editorial board include, or have included, [[Oxford University]] [[evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologist]] [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning scientist [[Jared Diamond]], [[Magician (illusion)|magician]] and [[escape artist]] turned educator [[James Randi|James “The Amazing” Randi]], actor, comedian, and ''[[Saturday Night Live]] '' alumna [[Julia Sweeney]], professional mentalist [[Mark Edward]], science writer [[Daniel Loxton]], [[Lawrence M. Krauss]] and [[Christof Koch]].
''Skeptic'' has an international circulation with over 50,000 subscriptions and is on newsstands in the U.S. and Canada as well as Europe, Australia, and other countries.&lt;ref name="skeptic.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.vueweekly.com/making_a_living_of_bullshit_detecting/ | title=Making a living of bullshit detecting | publisher=[[VUE Weekly]] |date=August 27, 2008 | first= | last= | accessdate =2008-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History, format and structure ==
The cover story of the magazine's very first issue paid tribute to [[scientist]] and [[science-fiction]] writer [[Isaac Asimov]].
&lt;ref name=Skeptic1&gt;[http://shop.skeptic.com/merchant.mvc?&amp;Screen=PROD&amp;Store_Code=SS&amp;Product_Code=magv01n1&amp;Category_Code=BIA "Vol. 1 No.1 (Premiere Issue) Tribute to Isaac Asimov"]. ''Skeptic''. Retrieved March 5, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; As Asimov wrote a number of stories featuring robots and coined the term "[[robotics]]", the cover of volume 12, #2 (2006), which is devoted to the topic of artificial intelligence, depicts a [[robot]] sitting on a park bench reading that first issue.&lt;ref name="Skeptic2"&gt;[http://shop.skeptic.com/merchant.mvc?&amp;Screen=PROD&amp;Store_Code=SS&amp;Product_Code=magv12n2 "Vol. 12 No. 2 Artificial Intelligence"]. ''Skeptic''. Retrieved March 5, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Every issue of the magazine opens with a description of The Skeptics Society and its mission statement, which is to explore subjects such as [[creationism]], [[pyramid power]], [[Bigfoot]], [[pseudohistory|pseudohistorical claims]] (as in the examples of [[Holocaust denial]] and extreme [[Afrocentrism]]), the use or misuse of theory and [[statistics]], [[conspiracy theories]], [[urban myths]], [[witch-hunt]]s, [[mass hysterias]], [[genius]] and [[intelligence]], and cultural influences on science, as well as controversies involving [[protoscience]]s at the leading edge of established science, and even [[fads]] like [[cryonics]] and [[low-carb diet]]s.  In addition to publishing the magazine, the Society also:

* sponsors lecture series at the [[California Institute of Technology]]
* produces and sells tapes of the lectures, as well as other books on pertinent subjects
* holds field trips to investigate and research such subjects
* conducts social events to promote good-will
* provides resources for the public, skeptic organizations (such as [[SkeptiCamp]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.skepticamp.org | title=Skepticamp | accessdate =2012-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and the media, with which they may approach controversial subjects from a skeptical viewpoint

In 2011, the magazine had three regular columnists: [[James Randi]] wrote "’Twas Brillig…," [[Harriet A. Hall]] wrote "The Skep Doc" and [[Karen Stollznow]] wrote "Bad Language".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title=Table of Contents | magazine=Skeptic | publisher=Skeptics Society | url=http://www.skeptic.com/the_magazine/archives/vol16n02.html | volume=16 | issue=2 | accessdate=July 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The magazine's page count was between approximately 100 and 110 pages until the 2010s. It was reduced to approximately 80 pages with Vol. 16 No. 3 (2011).{{CN|date=March 2018}} {{As of |2018}}, the magazine had two regular columnists: Harriet A. Hall and [[Carol Tavris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Skeptic: CURRENT ISSUE: VOLUME 23 NUMBER 1|url=https://www.skeptic.com/magazine/|website=skeptic.com|publisher=Skeptic Magazine|accessdate=30 March 2018|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330232530/https://www.skeptic.com/magazine/|archivedate=30 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Typical topics ===
Each issue features an [[editorial]]. In the past this was provided by [[James Randi]], and was often a reaction to stories from mainstream news media such as the 2005 story by the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[newsmagazine]] ''[[Primetime Live]]'' featuring a [[Brazil]]ian [[faith healer]], [[João de Deus (medium)|João Teixeira]].{{CN|date=March 2018}} Other times Randi wrote about topics he had investigated in the past, such as alleged [[dowser]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/11-08-31/#feature/|title = A Report from the Paranormal Trenches|website=Skeptic.com|publisher=Skeptic Magazine|accessdate=30 March 2018|date = 2011-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; alleged [[psychic]]s like [[Sylvia Browne]], and UFOs.{{CN|date=March 2018}}

The magazine also features a large correspondence section called "Forum". This includes not only letters from lay readers but also in-depth comments and rebuttals from [[professional]]s, contributing to extended academic debate across issues raised in past editions.{{CN|date=March 2018}}

The bulk of the magazine treats a variety of topics. [[Front cover|Cover stories]] have ranged from examination of alleged [[UFO]]s in [[religious icons]] and theories of the likelihood of [[artificial intelligence]] to tributes to luminaries such as [[Isaac Asimov]]&lt;ref name=Skeptic1/&gt; and [[Ernst Mayr]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Sulloway, Frank J.]] (February 2005). [http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/05-02-11/ "Ernst Mayr, 1904–2005Remembrances &amp; Tribute"]. ''Skeptic''.&lt;/ref&gt; Some editions feature special sections devoted to a particular topic or theme that is examined through multiple articles by different authors, such as [[intelligent design]] - a frequently recurring topic in the magazine, given the ongoing [[creation vs. evolution controversy]].{{CN|date=March 2018}}

=== ''Junior Skeptic'' ===
&lt;!-- Commented out: [[File:JuniorSkeptic.jpg|thumb|right|''Junior Skeptic'' focuses on one topic, and is written and illustrated in a manner more appealing to children]] --&gt;
Bound into most issues is a 10-page young-readers' section called ''[[Junior Skeptic]]''.  Heralded by a cover printed on glossy paper (the rest of the magazine is printed on non-glossy stock), ''Junior Skeptic'' focuses on one topic, or provides practical instruction written and illustrated in a style more appealing to children.

[[Daniel Loxton]] is the Editor of ''Junior Skeptic''. He writes and illustrates most issues.

The first edition of ''Junior Skeptic'' appeared in volume 6, #2 of ''Skeptic'' (2000).

== Official podcasts ==
In April 2006, an independent, skeptical talk program called ''Skepticality'' was relaunched as ''[[Skepticality|Skepticality: The Official Podcast of Skeptic Magazine]]''. New episodes of the show are released on a biweekly basis. The show is produced by the original, continuing show hosts ([[Robynn McCarthy]] and [[Derek Colanduno]]) in collaboration with staff of ''Skeptic'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article4470372.ece | title=Podcast of the week: Skepticality offers the 'truth' | publisher=[[The Times]] |date=August 9, 2008 | first=Chris | last=Campling | accessdate=August 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Towards a Global Ethic: An Initial Declaration''''' expresses the ethical commitments held in common by the world's religious, spiritual, and cultural traditions.&lt;ref name="ethic"&gt;"Towards a Global Ethic (An Initial Declaration)", Parliament of the World's Religions, Chicago, 1993. It is the Parliament's signature document.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weltethos.org/erkl%C3%A4rung%20zum%20weltethos/|title= ''Towards a Global Ethic: An Initial Declaration'' translated into various languages|accessdate=2013-08-17|format=PDF in Arabic, Malaysian, Bulgarian, Chinese, German, English, French, Italian, Catalan, Croatian, Dutch, Portuguese, Russian, Slovene, Spanish, Turkish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
At the request of the Council for a [[Parliament of the World's Religions]], [[Hans Küng]], President of the Foundation for a Global Ethic (''Stiftung Weltethos''), wrote an initial draft in consultation with fellow scholars and religious leaders. The Council's leaders and Trustees then worked on the final draft in consultation with Küng and their own, extensive network of leaders and scholars from various religions and regions. Most notable in leading this effort were [https://parliamentofreligions.org/videos/daniel-gomez-ibanez-first-director-parliament Daniel Gómez-Ibáñez], the Executive Director of the Council, and [https://eia.archchicago.org/about-us/presentations-and-contributions-by-the-vicar-very-reverend-thomas-a.-baima Thomas A. Baima], a member of the Board of Trustees.&lt;ref&gt;"Executive summary: 1993 Parliament of the World’s Religions." Chicago, Illinois: Council for the Parliament of the World’s Religions.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fundamental ethical demands ==
The declaration identifies two fundamental ethical demands as its foundation. First: the [[Golden Rule]]: ''What you wish done to yourself, do to others,'' "a principle which is found and has persisted in many religious and ethical traditions of humankind of thousands of years." Second: every human being must be treated humanely—an insight the beginnings of which exists in every great religious or ethical traditions.&lt;ref name="Kung book"&gt;Hans Küng, ''A Global Ethic: The Declaration of the Parliament of the World's Religions''(New York: Continuum, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Four shared directives ==
The two fundamental ethical demands are made concrete in four directives, which are "convincing and practical for all women and men of good will, religious and non-religious".&lt;ref name="ethic"/&gt; These directives are elaborated in the ''Global Ethic''. They are:

     1. Commitment to a culture of non-violence and respect for life.
     2. Commitment to a culture of solidarity and a just economic order.
     3. Commitment to a culture of tolerance and a life of truthfulness.
     4. Commitment to a culture of equal rights and partnership between men and women.

== Other unique features ==
=== The directives proclaim things held in common ===
The ''Global Ethic'' acknowledges that some significant differences exist between, and among, the religions. Still, these differences need not, it insists, stop them "from proclaiming publicly those things" that they already hold in common and that they jointly affirm. Each tradition holds those things to be true on the basis of their own religious or ethical grounds.&lt;ref name="ethic"/&gt;

=== Contains no religious or theological language ===
Because its goal was to express those things about which the world's religious, spiritual, and cultural traditions agree, no religious or theological terms appear in "the Global Ethic". Some religions such as [[Buddhism]] do not have a god while other religions such as [[Hinduism]] have many.

=== Calls for a change in inner consciousness ===
In his account of the writing of the ''Global Ethic'', Küng describes several working parameters: It should 1) make a clear distinction between the ethical level and the purely legal or political level, 2) not duplicate the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] because an ethic is more than [[rights]], 3) avoid political declarations, 4) not devolve into [[casuistry]], 5) forego any attempt to become a philosophical [[treatise]], and, 6) set aside enthusiastic religious proclamations. On a positive programmatic level, the declaration must: 1) penetrate to the deep ethical level of binding values, irrevocable criteria, and basic inner attitudes, 2) be capable of securing moral unanimity and steer clear of statements rejected by the religions, 3) offer constructive criticism, 4) relate to the world as it really is, 5) use language familiar to newspaper readers (no technical jargon!), 6) have a religious foundation since, for the religions, an ethic must have a religious foundation.&lt;ref name="Kung book"/&gt;

=== Endorsed globally ===
In the summer of 1993, "The ''Global Ethic''" was ratified as an official document of the Parliament of the World's Religions by a vote of its Trustees. It was then signed by more than 200 leaders from 40+ different faith traditions and spiritual communities during the [http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1993-06-04-9306040123-story.html international gathering organized by the Parliament in 1993] in Chicago, Illinois · USA.&lt;ref&gt;"The Assembly of Religious and Spiritual Leaders: List of Participants," 1993 Parliament of the World's Religions, The Art Institute of Chicago, September 2, 3, &amp; 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1993/09/03/declaration-of-a-global-ethic-signed-at-religious-parliament/ca995881-52e9-4ca1-9ebf-29097545132d/?utm_term=.d50729519b71 Laurie Goodstein, "'Declaration of a Global Ethic' Signed at Religious Parliament," Washington Post, September 3, 1993].&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of participants attending the gathering also endorsed "the ''Global Ethic''" by acclamation. Since 1993 leaders and individuals around the world continue to endorse the ''Global Ethic'' with their signatures.&lt;ref&gt;[https://parliamentofreligions.org/global-ethic-signatures List of individuals who have endorsed the Global Ethic.]&lt;/ref&gt; It has served as a common ground for people to discuss, to agree, and to cooperate for the good of all.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.carnegiecouncil.org/publications/ethics_online/0023 "In Search of Common Ground: The Role of a Global Ethic in Inter-Religious Dialogue." Carnegie Council for Ethics in International Affairs, July 1, 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2018: a fifth directive ==
Since 1993, agreement has emerged among the world's religious, spiritual, and cultural traditions on issues tied to the environment.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikipedia: Religion and environmentalism]]&lt;/ref&gt; Aware of this shift, and because the ''Global Ethic'' was intended from the start to be a living document, the Parliament of the World's Religions decided to expand the ''Global Ethic'' with a fifth directive. Led by Myriam Renaud, the Parliament's Global Ethic Project Director, a task force wrote an initial draft. After soliciting and reflecting on 100+ pages of comments offered by scholars and religious leaders from many of the world's faith traditions and regions, the task force prepared and then submitted a final draft to the Trustees for their vote.&lt;ref name="ethic"/&gt; The ''Global Ethic'', expanded with a fifth directive, became official in July 2018:

     5. Commitment to a culture of [[sustainability]] and care for the [[Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://parliamentofreligions.org/parliament/global-ethic/fifth-directive Full text of the fifth directive available on the website of the Parliament of the World's Religions.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Humanity's shared home was mentioned in the 1993 draft of the ''Global Ethic''. Its first directive states that the lives of animals and plants deserve protection and care and that people, especially with a view to future generations, have a special responsibility for the Earth's air, water and soil. The fifth directive sets out in greater detail what this responsibility entails—for example: "Caring and prudent use of resources is based on fairness in consumption and takes into account limits on what ecosystems can bear."

'''Zindīq''' is a medieval [[Islam]]ic term applied by Muslims to individuals who are considered to hold views or follow practices that are contrary to central Islamic dogmas.&lt;ref name="Lewis"&gt;{{citation|last=Lewis|first=Bernard|title=Islam in history: ideas, people, and events in the Middle East|publisher=Open Court|year=1993|page=287}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Under the Abbasids==
The Arabic ''zindīq'' is a loan word from pre-Islamic [[Middle Persian]] 𐭦𐭭𐭣𐭩𐭪 ''zandik'', a [[Zoroastrian]] term of uncertain etymology and meaning (for a discussion of the term in a pre-Islamic context, see ''[[zandik]]'').

Under the 8th-century [[Abbasid]]s, Arabic ''zindīq'' and the adjectival ''zandaqa'' could "denote many different things, though it seems primarily (or at least initially) to have signified a follower of [[Manichaeism]]."&lt;ref name="Zaman1997"&gt;{{citation|last=Zaman|first=Muhammad Qasim|title=Religion and Politics Under the Early 'Abbasids: The Emergence of the Proto-Sunni Elite|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0xkpdl6UVOwC&amp;pg=PA64|year=1997|publisher=Brill|pages=63-65}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, many of those persecuted for ''zandaqa'' under the Abbasids claimed to be Muslims, and when applied to Muslims, the accusation was that the accused secretly harbored Manichaean beliefs.&lt;ref name="Zaman1997" /&gt; "The proof for such an accusation was sought, if at all, in an indication of some kind of dualism, or if that individual openly flouted Islamic beliefs or practices."&lt;ref name="Zaman1997" /&gt; As such, certain Muslim poets of early Abbasid times could thus also be accused of ''zandaqa'' as much as an actual Manichaean might.&lt;ref name="Zaman1997" /&gt;

The charge of ''zandaqa'' was a serious one, and could cost the accused his/her life.&lt;ref name="Zaman1997" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Bowker|first=John|chapter=Zindiq|title=The Concise Oxford Dictionary of World Religions|year=1997|publisher=OUP}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  A history of the time states cites the "Spiller" caliph [[As-Saffah|Abu al-'Abbas]] as having said "tolerance is laudable, except in matters dangerous to religious belief, or to the sovereign's dignity."&lt;ref name="Glasse" /&gt; The third Abbasid caliph, [[Al-Mahdi]], ordered the composition of polemnical works to refute freethinkers and other heretics, and for years he tried to exterminate them absolutely, hunting them down and exterminating freethinkers in large numbers, putting to death anyone on mere suspicion of being a ''zindiq''.&lt;ref name="Glasse"&gt;{{citation|last=Glassé|first=Cyril|chapter=Zindiq|title=The New Encyclopedia of Islam|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=2013|edition=4th|page=491}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Al-Mahdi's successors, the caliphs [[al-Hadi]] and [[Harun al-Rashid]], continued the pogroms, although with diminished intensity during the reign of the latter and was later abolished by him.&lt;ref name="Zaman1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Christine"&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=aPgGBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA88&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwCWoVChMIq56WlPLLxgIVSweOCh0SkAfF#v=onepage&amp;f=false|title= Medieval Heresies|author= Christine Caldwell Ames|publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]]|year= 2015|page= 88|isbn= 9781107023369}}&lt;/ref&gt; This policy in turn influenced the [[Mihna]] policy of [[al-Ma'mun]] which targeted those Muslim religious scholars and officials who refused to accept the doctrine of created nature of Quran.&lt;ref name="Zaman1997" /&gt;

The reason for these persecutions are not easy to determine.&lt;ref name="Zaman1997" /&gt; ''Zandaqa'' was viewed as a threat to Islam, to Muslim society, and to the state.&lt;ref name="Zaman1997" /&gt; In the 8th century, Islamic norms were still under development and had not yet crystallized, and Muslims were still a small minority in the vast territories ruled by the caliphate, and even those who had converted were perceived to have been only "imperfectly" Islamized. Many of these converts had previously been Manichaeans, and Manichaeaism with its well developed missionary ideals had undergone a slight resurgence during early caliphate rule. As such, the Manichaeans were perceived as a threat to the security of the Muslim religious elite and to the Abbasid state. The threat was perceived to be especially evident in the quasi-scientific manner in which the Manichaeans posed unsettling questions, their skill at creating a favourable impression in public debate, and their ability in defending their own intellectually-appealing world-view.&lt;ref name="Zaman1997" /&gt;

==Later usage==
In time, Muslim theologians came to apply ''zindiq'' to "the criminal dissident—the professing Muslim who holds beliefs or follows practices contrary to the central dogmas of Islam and is therefore to be regarded as an apostate and an infidel. The jurists differ as to the theoretical formulation of the point of exclusion, but in fact usually adopt the practical criterion of open rebellion."&lt;ref name="Lewis" /&gt; 

In modern times, the term ''zindiq'' is occasionally used to denote members of religions, sects or cults that originated in a Muslim society but are considered heretical or independent faiths by mainstream Muslims.&lt;ref name="Adamec2016"&gt;{{citation | last = Adamec | first = Ludwig W. | year=2016 | p=494 | chapter=Zindiq | title= Historical Dictionary of Islam | location = London | publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield | isbn=1-4422-7723-8 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, a ''zindiq'' is perceived to be incorrigibly disloyal to the tenets of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Hughes | first = Thomas Patrick | year = 1895| edition=2nd | page = 713 | chapter = Zindīq| title = Dictionary of Islam | location = London | publisher = W.H.
