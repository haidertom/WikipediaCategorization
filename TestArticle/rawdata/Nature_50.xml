'''Adolf Dygasiński''' (March 7, 1839, [[Niegosławice, Pińczów County|Niegosławice]]–June 3, 1902, [[Grodzisk Mazowiecki]]) was a [[Poland|Polish]] novelist, publicist and educator. In [[Polish literature]], he was one of the leading representatives of [[Naturalism (literature)|Naturalism]]. 
==Life==
During his literary career, Dygasiński wrote forty-two short stories and novels. 
Since 1884 his works were being published in book-form and enjoyed considerable success. 
They were translated into Russian and German. 
In 1891, Dygasiński went on a trip to Brazil on a trail of Polish emigrants from [[Partitioned Poland]]. 
He produced a series of letters describing the tragic fate of Polish emigrees in South America. In the following years Dygasiński maintained a position of a tutor and coach for numerous wealthy landowning families. Late in life he settled in [[Warsaw]], where he died on June 6, 1902, and was buried at the local [[Powązkowski Cemetery]].

==Works== 
In his work Dygasiński often focused on topics of rural life and residents of small towns, highlighting the common fate of both, human and animal communities. Some of his most important work include: 

*Wilk, psy i ludzie (Wolf, dogs and humans; 1883) 
*Ogólne zasady pedagogiki dotyczące wykształcenia umysłu, uczuć, moralności i religijności (General principles of teaching in the education of mind, emotions, morality, and religion; 1883) 
*Na pańskim dworze (1884) At the court of the Lord (1884) 
*Głód i miłość (Hunger and Love; 1885) 
*Na warszawskim bruku (On the streets of Warsaw, 1886)

[[Image:Lorenz attractor yb.svg|thumb|200px|right|A plot of Lorenz's [[strange attractor]] for values ρ=28, σ = 10, β = 8/3. The butterfly effect or sensitive dependence on initial conditions is the property of a [[dynamical system]] that, starting from any of various arbitrarily close alternative [[initial condition]]s on the attractor, the [[iteration#mathematics|iterated points]] will become arbitrarily spread out from each other.]]

[[File:Double pendulum simultaneous realisations.ogv|thumb|200px|right|Experimental demonstration of the butterfly effect with different recordings of the same double pendulum. In each recording, the pendulum starts with almost the same initial condition. Over time the differences in the dynamics grow from almost unnoticeable to drastic ones.]]

In [[chaos theory]], the '''butterfly effect''' is the sensitive dependence on [[initial condition]]s in which a small change in one state of a [[deterministic]] [[nonlinear system]] can result in large differences in a later state.&lt;ref name="Boeing2016Systems"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://geoffboeing.com/publications/nonlinear-chaos-fractals-prediction/|author=Boeing, G.|title=Visual Analysis of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems: Chaos, Fractals, Self-Similarity and the Limits of Prediction|journal=Systems|date=2016|volume=4|issue=4|pages=37|accessdate=2016-12-02|doi=10.3390/systems4040037|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161203123841/http://geoffboeing.com/publications/nonlinear-chaos-fractals-prediction/|archivedate=2016-12-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term, coined by [[Edward Lorenz]], is derived from the metaphorical example of the details of a tornado (the exact time of formation, the exact path taken) being influenced by minor perturbations such as the flapping of the wings of a distant [[butterfly]] several weeks earlier. Lorenz discovered the effect when he observed that runs of his [[Numerical weather prediction|weather model]] with initial condition data that was rounded in a seemingly inconsequential manner would fail to reproduce the results of runs with the unrounded initial condition data. A very small change in initial conditions had created a significantly different outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lorenz|first=Edward N.|title=Deterministic Nonperiodic Flow|journal=Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences|date=March 1963|volume=20|issue=2|pages=130–141|doi=10.1175/1520-0469(1963)020&lt;0130:dnf&gt;2.0.co;2|bibcode=1963JAtS...20..130L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Lorenz gave a name to the phenomenon, the idea that small causes may have large effects in general and in weather specifically was earlier recognized by French mathematician and engineer [[Henri Poincaré]] and American mathematician and philosopher [[Norbert Wiener]]. [[Edward Norton Lorenz|Edward Lorenz]]'s work placed the concept of ''instability'' of the earth's [[atmosphere]] onto a quantitative base and linked the concept of instability to the properties of large classes of dynamic systems which are undergoing [[nonlinear dynamics]] and [[Chaos theory|deterministic chaos]].&lt;ref name="scholarpedia"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Butterfly effect - Scholarpedia|url = http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Butterfly_effect|website = www.scholarpedia.org|accessdate = 2016-01-02|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160102214427/http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Butterfly_effect|archivedate = 2016-01-02|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The butterfly effect can also be demonstrated by very simple systems.

==History==
In ''[[The Vocation of Man]]'' (1800), [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] says that "you could not remove a single grain of sand from its place without thereby ... changing something throughout all parts of the immeasurable whole".

[[Chaos theory]] and the sensitive dependence on initial conditions were described in the literature in a particular case of the [[three-body problem]] by [[Henri Poincaré]] in 1890.&lt;ref name="wolframscience.com"&gt;[http://www.wolframscience.com/reference/notes/971c Some Historical Notes: History of Chaos Theory] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060719234031/http://www.wolframscience.com/reference/notes/971c |date=2006-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He later proposed that such phenomena could be common, for example, in meteorology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Steves |first1=Bonnie |last2=Maciejewski | first2=AJ |date=September 2001 |title=The Restless Universe Applications of Gravitational N-Body Dynamics to Planetary Stellar and Galactic Systems |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-wa120qRW5wC |location=USA |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=0750308222 |accessdate=January 6, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1898, [[Jacques Hadamard]] noted general divergence of trajectories in spaces of negative curvature. [[Pierre Duhem]] discussed the possible general significance of this in 1908.&lt;ref name="wolframscience.com"/&gt;

The idea that one [[butterfly]] could eventually have a far-reaching [[ripple effect]] on subsequent historic events made its earliest known appearance in "[[A Sound of Thunder]]", a 1952 short story by [[Ray Bradbury]] about time travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/evolution/Time-and-The-Physics-of-Ray-Bradbury--.html | title = The Physics of Ray Bradbury's "A Sound of Thunder" | work = [[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] | date = 2012-06-15 | accessdate = 2015-09-02 | first = Faye | last = Flam | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150924130717/http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/evolution/Time-and-The-Physics-of-Ray-Bradbury--.html | archivedate = 2015-09-24 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, Lorenz was running a numerical computer model to redo a weather prediction from the middle of the previous run as a shortcut. He entered the initial condition 0.506 from the printout instead of entering the full precision 0.506127 value. The result was a completely different weather scenario.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=James |last=Gleick |title=Chaos: Making a New Science |location= |publisher=Viking |year=1987 |isbn=0-8133-4085-3 |page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lorenz wrote:
{{blockquote|
"At one point I decided to repeat some of the computations in order to examine what was happening in greater detail. I stopped the computer, typed in a line of numbers that it had printed out a while earlier, and set it running again. I went down the hall for a cup of coffee and returned after about an hour, during which time the computer had simulated about two months of weather. The numbers being printed were nothing like the old ones. I immediately suspected a weak vacuum tube or some other computer trouble, which was not uncommon, but before calling for service I decided to see just where the mistake had occurred, knowing that this could speed up the servicing process. Instead of a sudden break, I found that the new values at first repeated the old ones, but soon afterward differed by one and then several units in the last decimal place, and then began to differ in the next to the last place and then in the place before that. In fact, the differences more or less steadily doubled in size every four days or so, until all resemblance with the original output disappeared somewhere in the second month. This was enough to tell me what had happened: the numbers that I had typed in were not the exact original numbers, but were the rounded-off values that had appeared in the original printout. The initial round-off errors were the culprits; they were steadily amplifying until they dominated the solution." (E. N. Lorenz, ''The Essence of Chaos'', U. Washington Press, Seattle (1993), page 134)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chaos at fifty|url=http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/magazine/physicstoday/article/66/5/10.1063/PT.3.1977|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160518003926/http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/magazine/physicstoday/article/66/5/10.1063/PT.3.1977|archivedate=2016-05-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
}}

In 1963 Lorenz published a theoretical study of this effect in a highly cited, seminal paper called ''Deterministic Nonperiodic Flow''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lorenz|first=Edward N.|title=Deterministic Nonperiodic Flow|journal=Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences|date=March 1963|volume=20|issue=2|pages=130–141|url=http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/1520-0469%281963%29020%3C0130%3ADNF%3E2.0.CO%3B2|accessdate=3 June 2010|doi=10.1175/1520-0469(1963)020&lt;0130:DNF&gt;2.0.CO;2|bibcode = 1963JAtS...20..130L|issn=1520-0469}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=Deterministic+non-periodic+flow&amp;author=E.+N.+Lorenz&amp;publication_year=1963 Google Scholar citation record]&lt;/ref&gt; (the calculations were performed on a [[Royal McBee]] [[LGP-30]] computer).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~smillie/ComputerAndMe/Part19.html |title=Part19 |publisher=Cs.ualberta.ca |date=1960-11-22 |accessdate=2014-06-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090717061640/http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~smillie/ComputerAndMe/Part19.html |archivedate=2009-07-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lorenz1963" /&gt; Elsewhere he stated:{{quote| text=One meteorologist remarked that if the theory were correct, one flap of a [[Gull|sea gull]]'s wings would be enough to alter the course of the weather forever. The controversy has not yet been settled, but the most recent evidence seems to favor the sea gulls.&lt;ref name="Lorenz1963"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lorenz |first=Edward N. |last2= |first2= |date=1963 |title=The Predictability of Hydrodynamic Flow |url=http://eaps4.mit.edu/research/Lorenz/Predictability_hydrodynamic_flow_1963.pdf |journal=Transactions of the New York Academy of Sciences |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=409–432 |doi= |accessdate=1 September 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141010161512/http://eaps4.mit.edu/research/Lorenz/Predictability_hydrodynamic_flow_1963.pdf |archivedate=10 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Following suggestions from colleagues, in later speeches and papers Lorenz used the more poetic [[butterfly]]. According to Lorenz, when he failed to provide a title for a talk he was to present at the 139th meeting of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] in 1972, Philip Merilees concocted ''Does the flap of a butterfly’s wings in Brazil set off a tornado in Texas?'' as a title.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eaps4.mit.edu/research/Lorenz/Butterfly_1972.pdf Lorenz: "Predictability", AAAS 139th meeting, 1972] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130612164541/http://eaps4.mit.edu/research/Lorenz/Butterfly_1972.pdf |date=2013-06-12 }} Retrieved May 22, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Although a butterfly flapping its wings has remained constant in the expression of this concept, the location of the butterfly, the consequences, and the location of the consequences have varied widely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.ap42.com/2011/08/03/the-butterfly-effect-variations-on-a-meme/|title=The Butterfly Effects: Variations on a Meme|accessdate=3 August 2011|work=AP42 ...and everything|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111132249/http://blog.ap42.com/2011/08/03/the-butterfly-effect-variations-on-a-meme/|archivedate=11 November 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase refers to the idea that a butterfly's wings might create tiny changes in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] that may ultimately alter the path of a [[tornado]] or delay, accelerate or even prevent the occurrence of a tornado in another location. The butterfly does not power or directly create the tornado, but the term is intended to imply that the flap of the butterfly's wings can ''cause'' the tornado: in the sense that the flap of the wings is a part of the initial conditions; one set of conditions leads to a tornado while the other set of conditions doesn't. The flapping wing represents a small change in the initial condition of the system, which cascades to large-scale alterations of events (compare: [[domino effect]]). Had the butterfly not flapped its wings, the trajectory of the system might have been vastly different—but it's also equally possible that the set of conditions without the butterfly flapping its wings is the set that leads to a tornado.

The butterfly effect presents an obvious challenge to prediction, since initial conditions for a system such as the weather can never be known to complete accuracy. This problem motivated the development of [[ensemble forecasting]], in which a number of forecasts are made from perturbed initial conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Woods|first=Austin|title=Medium-range weather prediction: The European approach; The story of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts |page=118 |location=New York |publisher=Springer |year=2005 |isbn=978-0387269283 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scientists have since argued that the weather system is not as sensitive to initial conditions as previously believed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Orrell|first=David| last2=Smith | first2 = Leonard | last3=Barkmeijer | first3 = Jan | last4 = Palmer | first4 = Tim | title=Model error in weather forecasting|journal=Nonlinear Processes in Geophysics | year=2001| volume=9 | pages=357–371 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Orrell]] argues that the major contributor to weather forecast error is model error, with sensitivity to initial conditions playing a relatively small role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Orrell|first=David| title=Role of the metric in forecast error growth: How chaotic is the weather?|journal=Tellus | year=2002| volume=54A | pages=350–362| doi=10.3402/tellusa.v54i4.12159| bibcode=2002TellA..54..350O}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Orrell |first=David |title=Truth or Beauty: Science and the Quest for Order |page=208 |location=New Haven|publisher=Yale University Press |year=2012 |isbn=978-0300186611 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stephen Wolfram]] also notes that the Lorenz equations are highly simplified and do not contain terms that represent viscous effects; he believes that these terms would tend to damp out small perturbations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Wolfram|first=Stephen |title=A New Kind of Science |page=998 |location= |publisher=Wolfram Media |year=2002 |isbn=978-1579550080 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory and mathematical definition==
[[Poincaré recurrence theorem|Recurrence]], the approximate return of a system towards its initial conditions, together with sensitive dependence on initial conditions, are the two main ingredients for chaotic motion. They have the practical consequence of making [[complex system]]s, such as the [[weather]], difficult to predict past a certain time range (approximately a week in the case of weather) since it is impossible to measure the starting atmospheric conditions completely accurately.

A [[dynamical system]] displays sensitive dependence on initial conditions if points arbitrarily close together separate over time at an exponential rate.&lt;ref name="Boeing2016Systems" /&gt; The definition is not topological, but essentially metrical.

If ''M'' is the [[State space (dynamical system)|state space]] for the map &lt;math&gt;f^t&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f^t&lt;/math&gt; displays sensitive dependence to initial conditions if for any x in ''M'' and any δ&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0, there are y in ''M'', with distance ''d''(. , .) such that &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; d(x, y) &lt; \delta &lt;/math&gt; and such that

:&lt;math&gt;d(f^\tau(x), f^\tau(y)) &gt; \mathrm{e}^{a\tau} \, d(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;

for some positive parameter ''a''. The definition does not require that all points from a neighborhood separate from the base point ''x'', but it requires one positive [[Lyapunov exponent]].

The simplest mathematical framework exhibiting sensitive dependence on initial conditions is provided by a particular parametrization of the [[logistic map]]:

:&lt;math&gt;x_{n+1} = 4 x_n (1-x_n) , \quad 0\leq x_0\leq 1,&lt;/math&gt;

which, unlike most chaotic maps, has a [[closed-form solution]]:

:&lt;math&gt;x_{n}=\sin^{2}(2^{n} \theta \pi)&lt;/math&gt;

where the [[initial condition]] parameter &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is given by &lt;math&gt;\theta = \tfrac{1}{\pi}\sin^{-1}(x_0^{1/2})&lt;/math&gt;. For rational &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, after a finite number of [[iterated function|iterations]] &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; maps into a [[periodic point|periodic sequence]]. But [[almost all]] &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; are irrational, and, for irrational &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; never repeats itself – it is non-periodic. This solution equation clearly demonstrates the two key features of chaos – stretching and folding: the factor 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; shows the exponential growth of stretching, which results in sensitive dependence on initial conditions (the butterfly effect), while the squared sine function keeps &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt; folded within the range&amp;nbsp;[0,&amp;nbsp;1].

==In physical systems==

===In weather===

The butterfly effect is most familiar in terms of [[weather]]; it can easily be demonstrated in standard weather prediction models, for example. The climate scientists James Annan and William Connolley explain that chaos is important in the development of weather prediction methods; models are sensitive to initial conditions. They add the caveat: "Of course the existence of an unknown butterfly flapping its wings has no direct bearing on weather forecasts, since it will take far too long for such a small perturbation to grow to a significant size, and we have many more immediate uncertainties to worry about. So the direct impact of this phenomenon on weather prediction is often somewhat overstated."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2005/11/chaos-and-climate/ |title=Chaos and Climate |publisher=RealClimate |date= |accessdate=2014-06-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140702105624/http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2005/11/chaos-and-climate/ |archivedate=2014-07-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In quantum mechanics===

The potential for sensitive dependence on initial conditions (the butterfly effect) has been studied in a number of cases in [[Semiclassical physics|semiclassical]] and [[quantum mechanics|quantum physics]] including atoms in strong fields and the anisotropic [[Kepler problem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Postmodern Quantum Mechanics |first=E.

Other authors suggest that the butterfly effect can be observed in quantum systems. Karkuszewski et al. consider the time evolution of quantum systems which have slightly different [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonians]]. They investigate the level of sensitivity of quantum systems to small changes in their given Hamiltonians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Quantum Chaotic Environments, the Butterfly Effect, and Decoherence |first=Zbyszek P. |last=Karkuszewski |first2=Christopher |last2=Jarzynski |first3=Wojciech H. |last3=Zurek |journal=[[Physical Review Letters]] |volume=89 |issue=17 |year=2002 |page=170405 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.89.170405 |bibcode=2002PhRvL..89q0405K|arxiv = quant-ph/0111002 |pmid=12398653}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poulin et al. presented a quantum algorithm to measure fidelity decay, which "measures the rate at which identical initial states diverge when subjected to slightly different dynamics".

==In popular culture==
{{main|Butterfly effect in popular culture}}

The journalist Peter Dizikes, writing in ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' in 2008, notes that popular culture likes the idea of the butterfly effect, but gets it wrong. Whereas Lorenz suggested correctly with his butterfly metaphor that predictability "is inherently limited", popular culture supposes that each event can be explained by finding the small reasons that caused it. Dizikes explains: "It speaks to our larger expectation that the world should be comprehensible – that everything happens for a reason, and that we can pinpoint all those reasons, however small they may be. But nature itself defies this expectation."&lt;ref name="Globe"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Dizikes |first1=Petyer |title=The meaning of the butterfly |url=http://archive.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2008/06/08/the_meaning_of_the_butterfly/?page=full |accessdate=8 June 2016 |agency=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=8 June 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418154015/http://archive.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2008/06/08/the_meaning_of_the_butterfly/?page=full |archivedate=18 April 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Catalytic triad of TEV protease.png|thumb|360px|The enzyme [[TEV protease]]{{efn|name=TEV}} contains an example of a catalytic triad of residues (red) in its [[active site]]. The triad consists of an [[aspartate]] ([[acid]]), [[histidine]] ([[Base (chemistry)|base]]) and [[serine]] ([[nucleophile]]). The [[Substrate (chemistry)|substrate]] (black) is bound by the [[binding site]] to orient it next to the triad. {{PDB|1lvm}}]]

A '''catalytic triad''' is a set of three coordinated [[amino acid]]s that can be found in the [[active site]] of some [[enzymes]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="buller1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Buller|first=AR|author2=Townsend, CA|date=Feb 19, 2013|title=Intrinsic evolutionary constraints on protease structure, enzyme acylation, and the identity of the catalytic triad|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=110|issue=8|pages=E653–61|bibcode=2013PNAS..110E.653B|doi=10.1073/pnas.1221050110|pmc=3581919|pmid=23382230}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catalytic triads are most commonly found in [[hydrolase]] and [[transferase]] enzymes (e.g. [[protease]]s, [[amidase]]s, [[esterase]]s, acylases, [[lipase]]s and [[β-lactamase]]s). An [[Acid]]-[[Base (chemistry)|Base]]-[[Nucleophile]] triad is a common motif for generating a nucleophilic residue for [[covalent catalysis]]. The [[Amino acid|residues]] form a charge-relay network to polarise and activate the nucleophile, which attacks the [[Substrate (chemistry)|substrate]], forming a [[covalent]] intermediate which is then [[hydrolysed]] to release the [[Product (chemistry)|product]] and regenerate free enzyme. The nucleophile is most commonly a [[serine]] or [[cysteine]] amino acid, but occasionally [[threonine]] or even [[selenocysteine]]. The [[Protein tertiary structure|3D structure]] of the enzyme brings together the triad residues in a precise orientation, even though they may be far apart in the sequence ([[Protein primary structure|primary structure]]).&lt;ref name = "Stryer_Ch9"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Stryer L, Berg JM, Tymoczko JL | title = Biochemistry | publisher = W.H.

As well as [[divergent evolution]] of function (and even the triad's nucleophile), catalytic triads show some of the best examples of [[convergent evolution]].

== Function ==
Enzymes that contain a catalytic triad use it for one of two reaction types: either to [[hydrolysis|split]] a substrate ([[hydrolase]]s) or to transfer one portion of a substrate over to a second substrate ([[transferase]]s). Triads are an inter-dependent set of residues in the [[active site]] of an enzyme and act in concert with other residues (e.g. [[binding site]] and [[oxyanion hole]]) to achieve [[nucleophilic catalysis]]. These triad residues act together to make the [[nucleophile]] member highly [[Reactivity (chemistry)|reactive]], generating a covalent intermediate with the substrate that is then resolved to complete catalysis.

===Mechanism===
Catalytic triads perform [[covalent catalysis]] using a residue as a nucleophile. The reactivity of the nucleophilic residue is increased by the [[functional group]]s of the other triad members. The nucleophile is polarised and oriented by the base, which is itself bound and stabilised by the acid.

Catalysis is performed in two stages. First, the activated nucleophile attacks the [[carbonyl]] carbon and forces the carbonyl oxygen to accept an electron, leading to a tetrahedral [[reaction intermediate|intermediate]]. The build-up of negative charge on this intermediate is typically stabilized by an [[oxyanion hole]] within the active site. The intermediate then collapses back to a carbonyl, ejecting the first half of the substrate, but leaving the second half still covalently bound to the enzyme as an [[acyl-enzyme intermediate]]. The ejection of this first [[leaving group]] is often aided by donation of a proton by the base.

The second stage of catalysis is the resolution of the acyl-enzyme intermediate by the attack of a second substrate. If this substrate is water then the result is hydrolysis; if it is an organic molecule then the result is transfer of that molecule onto the first substrate. Attack by this second substrate forms a new tetrahedral intermediate, which resolves by ejecting the enzyme's nucleophile, releasing the second product and regenerating free enzyme.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=PhD Thesis|last=Thomas|first=Shafee,|title=Evolvability of a viral protease: experimental evolution of catalysis, robustness and specificity|date=2014|degree=PhD|publisher=University of Cambridge|url=https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/245207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wide image|Triad mechanism.svg|1000px|General reaction mechanism of catalysed by a catalytic triad (black): [[nucleophilic substitution]] at a [[carbonyl]] substrate (red) by a second substrate (blue). First, the enzyme's nucleophile (X) attacks the carbonyl to form a covalently linked acyl-enzyme intermediate. This intermediate is then attacked by the second substrate's nucleophile (X'). If the second nucleophile is the hydroxyl of water, the result is hydrolysis, otherwise the result is [[Transferase#Reactions|group transfer]] of X'.}}

==Identity of triad members==
[[File:Triad chemical mech.png|thumb|300px|A catalytic triad charge-relay system as commonly found in proteases. The acid residue (commonly [[glutamate]] or [[aspartate]]) aligns and polarises the base (usually [[histidine]]) which activates the nucleophile (often serine or cysteine, occasionally [[threonine]]). The triad reduces the [[pKa|p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;]] of the nucleophilic residue which then attacks the substrate. An [[oxyanion hole]] of positively charged usually backbone [[amide]]s (occasionally side-chains) stabilise charge build-up on the substrate [[transition state]].]]

===Nucleophile===
The side-chain of the nucleophilic residue performs covalent catalysis on the [[Substrate (chemistry)|substrate]]. The lone pair of electrons present on the oxygen or sulphur attacks the electropositive [[carbonyl]] carbon.&lt;ref name="Stryer_Ch9"/&gt; The 20 [[amino acid#Standard amino acids|naturally occurring biological amino acids]] do not contain any sufficiently nucleophilic functional groups for many difficult [[catalytic reaction]]s. Embedding the nucleophile in a triad increases its reactivity for efficient catalysis. The most commonly used nucleophiles are the [[hydroxyl]] (OH) of serine and the [[thiol]]/thiolate ion (SH/S&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) of cysteine.&lt;ref name="buller1" /&gt; Alternatively, [[threonine protease]]s use the [[secondary alcohol|secondary hydroxyl]] of threonine, however due to [[steric hindrance]] of the side chain's extra [[methyl group]] such proteases use their [[N-terminal|''N''-terminal]] amide as the base, rather than a separate amino acid.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ekici2023"/&gt;

Use of oxygen or sulphur as the nucleophilic atom causes minor differences in catalysis. Compared to [[Nucleophile#Oxygen|oxygen]], [[Nucleophile#sulphur|sulphur]]’s extra [[d orbital]] makes it larger (by 0.4 Å)&lt;ref name="mcgrath92642"&gt;{{cite journal|last = McGrath|first = ME|author2 = Wilke, ME|author3 = Higaki, JN|author4 = Craik, CS|author5 = Fletterick, RJ|title = Crystal structures of two engineered thiol trypsins.|journal = Biochemistry|date = Nov 28, 1989|volume = 28|issue = 24|pages = 9264–70|pmid = 2611228|doi = 10.1021/bi00450a005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and softer, allows it to form longer bonds (d&lt;sub href="thiol"&gt;C-X&lt;/sub&gt; and d&lt;sub href="Nucleophile#Oxygen"&gt;X-H&lt;/sub&gt; by 1.3-fold), and gives it a lower p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; (by 5 units).&lt;ref name="polgár3232"&gt;{{cite journal|last = Polgár|first = L|author2 = Asbóth, B|title = The basic difference in catalyses by serine and cysteine proteinases resides in charge stabilization in the transition state.|journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology|date = Aug 7, 1986|volume = 121|issue = 3|pages = 323–6|pmid = 3540454|doi = 10.1016/s0022-5193(86)80111-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serine is therefore more dependent than cysteine on optimal orientation of the acid-base triad members to reduce its p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref name="polgár3232" /&gt; in order to achieve concerted [[deprotonation]] with catalysis.&lt;ref name="buller1" /&gt; The low p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; of cysteine works to its disadvantage in the resolution of the first [[tetrahedral intermediate]] as unproductive reversal of the original nucleophilic attack is the more favourable breakdown product.&lt;ref name="buller1" /&gt; The triad base is therefore preferentially oriented to [[protonate]] the leaving group amide to ensure that it is ejected to leave the enzyme sulphur covalently bound to the substrate N-terminus. Finally, resolution of the acyl-enzyme (to release the substrate C-terminus) requires serine to be re-protonated whereas cysteine can leave as S&lt;sup href="deprotonation"&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;. [[Sterically]], the sulphur of cysteine also forms longer bonds and has a bulkier [[van der Waals radius]]&lt;ref name="buller1" /&gt; and if [[mutated]] to serine can be trapped in unproductive orientations in the active site.&lt;ref name="mcgrath92642" /&gt;

Very rarely, the [[selenium]] atom of the uncommon amino acid [[selenocysteine]] is used as a nucleophile.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The deprotonated Se&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; state is strongly favoured when in a catalytic triad.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Base===
Since no natural amino acids are strongly nucleophilic, the base in a catalytic triad [[Chemical polarity|polarise]]s and [[deprotonate]]s the nucleophile to increase its reactivity.&lt;ref name="Stryer_Ch9"/&gt; Additionally, it [[protonate]]s the first [[Product (chemistry)|product]] to aid leaving group departure.

The base is most commonly histidine since its p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; allows for effective base catalysis, hydrogen bonding to the acid residue, and deprotonation of the nucleophile residue.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dodson|first=G|author2=Wlodawer, A|title=Catalytic triads and their relatives.|journal=Trends in Biochemical Sciences|date=September 1998|volume=23|issue=9|pages=347–52|pmid=9787641|doi=10.1016/S0968-0004(98)01254-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[β-lactamase]]s such as [[TEM-1]] use a [[lysine]] residue as the base. Because lysine's p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; is so high (p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;=11), a glutamate and several other residues act as the acid to stabilise its deprotonated state during the catalytic cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Damblon|first=C|author2=Raquet, X |author3=Lian, LY |author4=Lamotte-Brasseur, J |author5=Fonze, E |author6=Charlier, P |author7=Roberts, GC |author8= Frère, JM |title=The catalytic mechanism of beta-lactamases: NMR titration of an active-site lysine residue of the TEM-1 enzyme|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=Mar 5, 1996|volume=93|issue=5|pages=1747–52|pmid=8700829|doi=10.1073/pnas.93.5.1747|bibcode=1996PNAS...93.1747D |pmc=39852}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jelsch|first=C|author2=Lenfant, F |author3=Masson, JM |author4= Samama, JP |title=Beta-lactamase TEM1 of E. coli.

===Acid===
The acidic triad member forms a hydrogen bond with the basic residue. This aligns the basic residue by restricting its side-chain rotation, and polarises it by stabilising its positive charge.&lt;ref name="Stryer_Ch9" /&gt; Two amino acids have acidic [[Amino acid#Side chains|side chains]] at physiological pH (aspartate or glutamate) and so are the most commonly used for this triad member.&lt;ref name="Stryer_Ch9"/&gt; [[Cytomegalovirus]] protease{{efn|name=Cytomegalovirus}} uses a pair of histidines, one as the base, as usual, and one as the acid.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; The second histidine is not as effective an acid as the more common aspartate or glutamate, leading to a lower catalytic efficiency. In some enzymes, the acid member of the triad is less necessary and some act only as a dyad. For example, [[papain]]{{efn|Papain {{MEROPS|clan=CA|fam=C1}}|name = papain}} uses [[asparagine]] as its third triad member which orients the histidine base but does not act as an acid. Similarly, [[hepatitis A]] virus protease{{efn|Hepatitis A virus protease {{MEROPS|clan=PA|fam=C3}}}} contains an ordered water in the position where an acid residue should be.

==Examples of triads==

On the left are the nucleophile, base and acid triad members. On the right are different substrates with the cleaved bond indicated by a pair of scissors. Two different bonds in [[beta-lactam]]s can be cleaved (1 by [[penicillin acylase]] and 2 by [[beta-lactamase]]).]]

===Ser-His-Asp===
The Serine-Histidine-Aspartate motif is one of the most thoroughly characterised catalytic motifs in biochemistry.&lt;ref name="Stryer_Ch9"/&gt; The triad is exemplified by [[chymotrypsin]],{{efn|name=Chymotrypsin|Chymotrypsin {{MEROPS|clan=PA|fam=S1}}}} a model serine protease from the [[PA clan|PA superfamily]] which uses its triad to hydrolyse protein backbones. The aspartate is hydrogen bonded to the histidine, increasing the p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; of its imidazole nitrogen from 7 to around 12. This allows the histidine to act as a powerful general base and to activate the serine nucleophile. It also has an [[oxyanion hole]] consisting of several backbone amides which stabilises charge build-up on intermediates. The histidine base aids the first leaving group by donating a proton, and also activates the hydrolytic water substrate by abstracting a proton as the remaining OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; attacks the acyl-enzyme intermediate.

The same triad has also convergently evolved in [[α/β hydrolase]]s such as some [[lipase]]s and [[esterase]]s, however [[chirality|orientation]] of the triad members is reversed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sun|first=Yueru|last2=Yin|first2=Shuhui|last3=Feng|first3=Yitao|last4=Li|first4=Jie|last5=Zhou|first5=Jiahai|last6=Liu|first6=Changdong|last7=Zhu|first7=Guang|last8=Guo|first8=Zhihong|date=2014-05-30|title=Molecular Basis of the General Base Catalysis of an α/β-Hydrolase Catalytic Triad|url=http://www.jbc.org/content/289/22/15867|journal=Journal of Biological Chemistry|language=en|volume=289|issue=22|pages=15867–15879|doi=10.1074/jbc.m113.535641|issn=0021-9258|pmid=24737327|pmc=4140940}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rauwerdink|first=Alissa|last2=Kazlauskas|first2=Romas J.|date=2015-10-02|title=How the Same Core Catalytic Machinery Catalyzes 17 Different Reactions: the Serine-Histidine-Aspartate Catalytic Triad of α/β-Hydrolase Fold Enzymes|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.5b01539|journal=ACS Catalysis|volume=5|issue=10|pages=6153–6176|doi=10.1021/acscatal.5b01539}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, brain [[acetyl hydrolase]] (which has the same fold as a small [[G-protein]]) has also been found to have this triad. The equivalent Ser-His-''Glu ''triad is used in [[acetylcholinesterase]].

===Cys-His-Asp===
The second most studied triad is the Cysteine-Histidine-Aspartate motif.&lt;ref name="buller1"/&gt; Several families of [[cysteine protease]]s use this triad set, for example TEV protease{{efn|name=TEV|TEV protease {{MEROPS|clan=PA|fam=C4}}}} and [[papain]].{{efn|name=papain|Papain {{MEROPS|clan=CA|fam=C1}}}} The triad acts similarly to serine protease triads, with a few notable differences. Due to cysteine's low p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;, the importance of the Asp to catalysis varies and several cysteine proteases are effectively Cys-His dyads (e.g. [[hepatitis A|hepatitis A virus]] protease), whilst in others the cysteine is already deprotonated before catalysis begins (e.g. papain).&lt;ref name="beveridge1355"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beveridge|first=AJ|title=A theoretical study of the active sites of papain and S195C rat trypsin: implications for the low reactivity of mutant serine proteinases|journal=Protein Science|date=July 1996|volume=5|issue=7|pages=1355–65|pmid=8819168|pmc=2143470|doi=10.1002/pro.5560050714}}&lt;/ref&gt; This triad is also used by some amidases, such as [[Peptide-N4-(N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminyl)asparagine amidase|''N''-glycanase]] to hydrolyse non-peptide C-N bonds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The PUB Domain Functions as a p97 Binding Module in Human Peptide ''N''-Glycanase|journal = Journal of Biological Chemistry|year = 2006|issn = 0021-9258|pmid = 16807242|pages = 25502–25508|volume = 281|issue = 35|doi = 10.1074/jbc.M601173200|first = Mark D.|last = Allen|first2 = Alexander|last2 = Buchberger|first3 = Mark|last3 = Bycroft}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ser-His-His===
The triad of [[cytomegalovirus]] protease{{efn|name=Cytomegalovirus|Cytomegalovirus protease {{MEROPS|clan=SH|fam=S21}}}} uses histidine as both the acid and base triad members. Removing the acid histidine results in only a 10-fold activity loss (compared to &gt;10,000-fold when aspartate is removed from chymotrypsin). This triad has been interpreted as a possible way of generating a less active enzyme to control cleavage rate.&lt;ref name="ekici2023"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ekici|first=OD|author2=Paetzel, M |author3=Dalbey, RE |title=Unconventional serine proteases: variations on the catalytic Ser/His/Asp triad configuration.|journal=Protein Science|date=December 2008|volume=17|issue=12|pages=2023–37|pmid=18824507|doi=10.1110/ps.035436.108|pmc=2590910}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An unusual triad is found in seldolisin proteases.{{efn|Seldolisin protease {{MEROPS|clan=SB|fam=53}}}} The low p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; of the glutamate carboxylate group means that it only acts as a base in the triad at very low pH.

Threonine proteases, such as the [[proteasome]] protease subunit{{efn|name=Proteasome|Proteasome {{MEROPS|clan=PB|fam=T1}}}} and [[Glutamate N-acetyltransferase|ornithine acyltransferases]]{{efn|name=OAT|Ornithine acyltransferases {{MEROPS|clan=PE|fam=T5}}}} use the secondary hydroxyl of threonine in a manner analogous to the use of the serine [[primary alcohol|primary hydroxyl]].&lt;ref name="brannigan416"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brannigan|first=JA|author2=Dodson, G |author3=Duggleby, HJ |author4=Moody, PC |author5=Smith, JL |author6=Tomchick, DR |author7= Murzin, AG |title=A protein catalytic framework with an ''N''-terminal nucleophile is capable of self-activation|journal=Nature|date=Nov 23, 1995|volume=378|issue=6555|pages=416–9|pmid=7477383|doi=10.1038/378416a0|bibcode=1995Natur.378..416B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cheng1902"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cheng|first=H|author2=Grishin, NV|title=DOM-fold: a structure with crossing loops found in DmpA, ornithine acetyltransferase, and molybdenum cofactor-binding domain.|journal=Protein Science|date=July 2005|volume=14|issue=7|pages=1902–10|pmid=15937278|doi=10.1110/ps.051364905|pmc=2253344}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the steric interference of the extra methyl group of threonine, the base member of the triad is the ''N''-terminal amide which polarises an ordered water which, in turn, [[deprotonates]] the catalytic hydroxyl to increase its reactivity.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ekici2023"/&gt; Similarly, there exist equivalent 'serine only' and 'cysteine only' configurations such as [[penicillin acylase]] G{{efn|Penicillin acylase G {{MEROPS|clan=PB|fam=S45}}}} and [[penicillin acylase]] V{{efn|Penicillin acylase V {{MEROPS|clan=PB|fam=C59}}}} which are evolutionarily related to the proteasome proteases. Again, these use their ''N''-terminal amide as a base.&lt;ref name="ekici2023" /&gt;

===Ser-''cis''Ser-Lys===
This unusual triad occurs only in one superfamily of amidases. In this case, the lysine acts to polarise the middle serine.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shin|first=S|author2=Yun, YS |author3=Koo, HM |author4=Kim, YS |author5=Choi, KY |author6= Oh, BH |title=Characterization of a novel Ser-cisSer-Lys catalytic triad in comparison with the classical Ser-His-Asp triad.|journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry|date=Jul 4, 2003|volume=278|issue=27|pages=24937–43|pmid=12711609|doi=10.1074/jbc.M302156200}}&lt;/ref&gt; The middle serine then forms two strong hydrogen bonds to the nucleophilic serine to activate it (one with the side chain hydroxyl and the other with the backbone amide). The middle serine is held in an unusual ''[[Cis–trans isomerism|cis]]'' orientation to facilitate precise contacts with the other two triad residues. The triad is further unusual in that the lysine and ''cis''-serine both act as the base in activating the catalytic serine, but the same lysine also performs the role of the acid member as well as making key structural contacts.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cerqueira|first=N.

===Sec-His-Glu===
The rare, but naturally occurring amino acid [[selenocysteine]] (Sec), can also be found as the nucleophile in some catalytic triads.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brandt|first=Wolfgang|last2=Wessjohann|first2=Ludger A.|date=2005-02-04|title=The Functional Role of Selenocysteine (Sec) in the Catalysis Mechanism of Large Thioredoxin Reductases: Proposition of a Swapping Catalytic Triad Including a Sec-His-Glu State|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cbic.200400276/abstract|journal=ChemBioChem|language=en|volume=6|issue=2|pages=386–394|doi=10.1002/cbic.200400276|issn=1439-7633}}&lt;/ref&gt; Selenocysteine is similar to cysteine, but contains a [[selenium]] atom instead of a sulphur. An example is in the active site of [[thioredoxin reductase]], which uses the selenium for reduction of disulphide in thioredoxin.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Engineered triads===
In addition to naturally occurring types of catalytic triads, [[protein engineering]] has been used to create enzyme variants with non-native amino acids, or entirely synthetic amino acids.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Toscano|first=Miguel D.|last2=Woycechowsky|first2=Kenneth J.|last3=Hilvert|first3=Donald|date=2007-04-27|title=Minimalist Active-Site Redesign: Teaching Old Enzymes New Tricks|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.200604205/abstract|journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition|language=en|volume=46|issue=18|pages=3212–3236|doi=10.1002/anie.200604205|issn=1521-3773}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catalytic triads have also been inserted into otherwise non-catalytic proteins, or protein mimics.

==Divergent evolution==
The sophistication of the active site network causes residues involved in catalysis (and residues in contact with these) to be highly [[evolutionarily conserved]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Halabi|first = N|author2 = Rivoire, O|author3 = Leibler, S|author4 = Ranganathan, R|title = Protein sectors: evolutionary units of three-dimensional structure.|journal = Cell|date = Aug 21, 2009|volume = 138|issue = 4|pages = 774–86|pmid = 19703402|doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2009.07.038|pmc=3210731}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are examples of divergent evolution in catalytic triads, both in the reaction catalysed, and the residues used in catalysis.

=== Reaction changes ===
Catalytic triads perform [[covalent catalysis]] via an acyl-enzyme intermediate. If this intermediate is resolved by water, the result is hydrolysis of the substrate. However, if the intermediate is resolved by attack by a second substrate, then the enzyme acts as a [[transferase]]. For example, attack by an [[acyl]] group results in an [[acyltransferase]] reaction. Several families of transferase enzymes have evolved from hydrolases by adaptation to exclude water and favour attack of a second substrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Sinapoyltransferases in the light of molecular evolution|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031942209002970|journal = Phytochemistry|date = October 2009|pages = 1652–1662|volume = 70|series = Evolution of Metabolic Diversity|issue = 15–16|doi = 10.1016/j.phytochem.2009.07.023|first = Felix|last = Stehle|first2 = Wolfgang|last2 = Brandt|first3 = Milton T.|last3 = Stubbs|first4 = Carsten|last4 = Milkowski|first5 = Dieter|last5 = Strack|pmid=19695650}}&lt;/ref&gt; In different members of the α/β-hydrolase superfamily, the Ser-His-Asp triad is tuned by surrounding residues to perform at least 17 different reactions.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dimitriou|first=Polytimi S.|last2=Denesyuk|first2=Alexander|last3=Takahashi|first3=Seiji|last4=Yamashita|first4=Satoshi|last5=Johnson|first5=Mark S.|last6=Nakayama|first6=Toru|last7=Denessiouk|first7=Konstantin|date=2017-10-01|title=Alpha/beta-hydrolases: A unique structural motif coordinates catalytic acid residue in 40 protein fold families|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/prot.25338/abstract|journal=Proteins: Structure, Function, and Bioinformatics|language=en|volume=85|issue=10|pages=1845–1855|doi=10.1002/prot.25338|issn=1097-0134}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these reactions are also achieved with mechanisms that have altered formation, or resolution of the acyl-enzyme intermediate, or that don't proceed via an acyl-enzyme intermediate.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Additionally, an alternative transferase mechanism has been evolved by [[amidophosphoribosyltransferase]]s, which has two active sites.{{efn|amidophosphoribosyltransferase {{MEROPS|clan=PB|fam=C44}}}} In the first active site, a cysteine triad hydrolyses a [[glutamine]] substrate to release free ammonia.

Divergent evolution of active site residues is slow, due to strong chemical constraints.

This can be inferred when a superfamily (with the same [[protein structure|fold]]) contains [[protein family|families]] that use different nucleophiles.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Such nucleophile switches have occurred several times during evolutionary history, however the mechanisms by which this happen are still unclear.&lt;ref name="pmid19892822"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The [[enzymology]] of proteases provides some of the clearest known examples of convergent evolution. The same geometric arrangement of triad residues occurs in over 20 separate enzyme [[Superfamily (proteins)|superfamilies]]. Each of these superfamilies is the result of convergent evolution for the same triad arrangement within a different [[Protein tertiary structure|structural fold]]. This is because there are limited productive ways to arrange three triad residues, the enzyme backbone and the substrate. These examples reflect the intrinsic chemical and physical constraints on enzymes, leading evolution to repeatedly and independently converge on equivalent solutions.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="buller1"/&gt;

=== Cysteine and serine hydrolases ===
The same triad geometries been converged upon by serine proteases such as the [[chymotrypsin]]{{efn|name=Chymotrypsin}} and [[subtilisin]] superfamilies. Similar convergent evolution has occurred with cysteine proteases such as viral [[C3 protease]] and [[papain]]{{efn|Papain {{MEROPS|clan=CA|fam=C1}}|name = papain}} superfamilies. These triads have converged to almost the same arrangement due to the mechanistic similarities in cysteine and serine proteolysis mechanisms.&lt;ref name="buller1" /&gt;

=== Threonine proteases ===
Threonine proteases use the amino acid threonine as their catalytic nucleophile. Unlike cysteine and serine, threonine is a secondary hydroxyl (i.e. has a methyl group). This methyl group greatly restricts the possible orientations of triad and substrate as the methyl clashes with either the enzyme backbone or histidine base.&lt;ref name="buller1" /&gt; When the nucleophile of a serine protease was mutated to threonine, the methyl occupied a mixture of positions, most of which prevented substrate binding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pelc|first=Leslie A.|last2=Chen|first2=Zhiwei|last3=Gohara|first3=David W.|last4=Vogt|first4=Austin D.|last5=Pozzi|first5=Nicola|last6=Di Cera|first6=Enrico|date=2015-02-24|title=Why Ser and Not Thr Brokers Catalysis in the Trypsin Fold|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.5b00014|journal=Biochemistry|volume=54|issue=7|pages=1457–1464|doi=10.1021/acs.biochem.5b00014|issn=0006-2960|pmc=4342846}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the catalytic residue of a threonine protease is located at it ''N''-terminus.&lt;ref name="buller1" /&gt;

Two evolutionarily independent [[enzyme superfamilies]] with different protein folds are known to use the ''N''-terminal residue as a nucleophile: Superfamily PB (proteasomes using the Ntn fold)&lt;ref name="brannigan416" /&gt; and Superfamily PE ([[acetyltransferase]]s using the DOM fold)&lt;ref name="cheng1902" /&gt; This commonality of [[active site]] structure in completely different protein folds indicates that the active site evolved convergently in those superfamilies.&lt;ref name="buller1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ekici2023" /&gt;

[[File:Gase-in-Entladungsroehren.jpg|thumb|right|A set of cold cathode discharge tubes]]
A '''cold cathode'''&lt;ref&gt;{{US Patent|1993187}}, Cold cathode discharge tube&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[cathode]] that is not electrically heated by a [[Electrical filament|filament]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;A negatively charged [[electrode]] emits [[electron]]s or is the positively charged terminal. For more, see [[field emission]].&lt;/ref&gt; A cathode may be considered "cold" if it emits more electrons than can be supplied by [[thermionic emission]] alone. It is used in [[Gas discharge lamp|gas-discharge lamps]], such as [[neon lamp]]s, [[discharge tube]]s, and some types of [[vacuum tube]]. The other type of cathode is a [[hot cathode]], which is heated by electric current passing through a [[Electrical filament|filament]]. A cold cathode does not necessarily operate at a low temperature: it is often heated to its [[operating temperature]] by other methods, such as the current passing from the cathode into the gas.

==Cold-cathode devices==
[[Image:ZM1210-operating edit2.jpg|thumb|upright|
The stacked digit arrangement in a [[Nixie tube]] is visible here]]

A cold-cathode vacuum tube does not rely on external heating of an electrode to provide [[thermionic emission]] of electrons. Early cold-cathode devices included the [[Geissler tube]] and [[Julius Plücker|Plucker tube]], and early [[cathode ray tube]]s.  Study of the phenomena in these devices led to the discovery of the electron.

[[Neon lamp]]s are used both to produce light as indicators and for special-purpose illumination, and also as circuit elements displaying [[negative resistance]]. Addition of a trigger electrode to a device allowed the glow discharge to be initiated by an external control circuit; [[Bell Laboratories]] developed a "trigger tube" cold-cathode device in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;D. M. Neale, ''Cold Cathode Tube Circuit Design'', Francis and Taylor, 1964. pp. 1–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many types of cold-cathode switching tube were developed, including various types of [[thyratron]], the [[krytron]], cold-cathode displays ([[Nixie tube]]) and others. [[Voltage regulator]] tubes rely on the relatively constant voltage of a [[glow discharge]] over a range of current and were used to stabilize power-supply voltages in tube-based instruments. A [[Dekatron]] is a cold-cathode tube with multiple electrodes that is used for counting.  Each time a pulse is applied to a control electrode, a glow discharge moves to a step electrode; by providing ten electrodes in each tube and cascading the tubes, a counter system can be developed and the count observed by the position of the glow discharges. Counter tubes were used widely before development of [[integrated circuit]] counter devices.

The [[flash tube]] is a cold-cathode device filled with [[xenon]] gas, used to produce an intense short pulse of light for photography or to act as a [[stroboscope]] to examine the motion of moving parts.

===Lamps===
Cold-cathode lamps include [[cold-cathode fluorescent lamp]]s ('''CCFLs''') and [[neon lamp]]s. Neon lamps primarily rely on excitation of gas molecules to emit light; CCFLs use a discharge in mercury vapor to develop ultraviolet light, which in turn causes a [[fluorescence|fluorescent]] coating on the inside of the lamp to emit visible light.

Cold-cathode fluorescent lamps are used for [[backlight]]ing of [[LCD]]s, for example computer monitors and television screens.

In the lighting industry, “cold cathode” historically refers to luminous tubing larger than 20&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter and operating on a current of 120 to 240 milliamperes. This larger-diameter tubing is often used for interior alcove and general lighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Ifay guide info electric discharge lighting systems, cold cathode| url =http://database.ul.com/cgi-bin/XYV/template/LISEXT/1FRAME/showpage.html?name=IFAY.GuideInfo&amp;ccnshorttitle=Electric+Discharge+Lighting+Systems,+Cold+Cathode&amp;objid=1074096534&amp;cfgid=1073741824&amp;version=versionless&amp;parent_id=1073988136&amp;sequence=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EGL lighting products |url=http://www.egl-lighting.com/products.html |accessdate=9 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101026042259/http://www.egl-lighting.com/products.html |archivedate=October 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The term "neon lamp" refers to tubing that is smaller than 15&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter{{cn|date=September 2015}} and typically operates at approximately 40 milliamperes.  These lamps are commonly used for neon signs.

==Details==
The cathode is the negative electrode. Any gas-discharge lamp has a positive (anode) and a negative electrode. Both electrodes alternate between acting as an anode and a cathode when these devices run with [[alternating current]].

[[File:Cold Cathodes.jpg|thumb|A standard computer case fitted with blue and green cold-cathode tubes]]
[[File:Cold Cathode Fluorescent Lamp.JPG|thumb|Cold-cathode fluorescent lamp]]

A ''cold cathode'' is distinguished from a [[hot cathode]] that is heated to induce [[thermionic emission]] of [[electron]]s. Discharge tubes with hot cathodes have an envelope filled with low-pressure gas and containing two electrodes. Examples are most common [[fluorescent lamp]]s, high-pressure discharge lamps and [[vacuum fluorescent display]]s.

The surface of cold cathodes can emit [[secondary electrons]] at a ratio greater than unity (breakdown).  An electron that leaves the cathode will collide with neutral gas molecules.  The collision may just excite the molecule, but sometimes it will knock an electron free to create a positive ion.  The original electron and the freed electron continue toward the anode and may create more positive ions (see [[Townsend avalanche]]). The result is for each electron that leaves the cathode, several positive ions are generated that eventually crash onto the cathode. Some crashing positive ions may generate a secondary electron. The discharge is self-sustaining when for each electron that leaves the cathode, enough positive ions hit the cathode to free, on average, another electron. External circuitry limits the discharge current.  Cold-cathode discharge lamps use higher voltages than hot-cathode ones. The resulting strong electric field near the cathode accelerates ions to a sufficient velocity to create free electrons from the cathode material.

Another mechanism to generate free electrons from a cold metallic surface is [[field electron emission]]. It is used in some [[x-ray tube]]s, the [[field-emission microscopy|field-electron microscope]] (FEM), and [[field-emission display]]s (FEDs).

Cold cathodes sometimes have a [[rare-earth]] coating to enhance electron emission. Some types contain a source of [[beta radiation]] to start [[ionization]] of the gas that fills the tube.&lt;ref&gt;{{US Patent|1860149}}, Discharge tube.&lt;/ref&gt; In some tubes, [[glow discharge]] around the cathode is usually minimized; instead there is a so-called positive column, filling the tube.&lt;ref&gt;{{US Patent|2103033}}, Electron emissive electrode.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{US Patent|1316967}}, Gaseous-conduction lamp.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Positive column is part of a glow discharge, such as in the [[Moore lamp]].&lt;/ref&gt; Examples are the [[neon lamp]] and [[nixie tube]]s. Nixie tubes too are cold-cathode neon displays that are in-line, but not in-plane, display devices.

Cold-cathode devices typically use a complex [[high-voltage power supply]] with some mechanism for limiting current. Although creating the initial space charge and the first arc of current through the tube may require a very high voltage, once the tube begins to heat up, the electrical resistance drops, thus increasing the [[electric current]] through the lamp. To offset this effect and maintain normal operation, the supply voltage is gradually lowered. In the case of tubes with an ionizing gas, the gas can become a very hot [[plasma (physics)|plasma]], and electrical resistance is greatly reduced. If operated from a simple power supply without current limiting, this reduction in resistance would lead to damage to the power supply and overheating of the tube electrodes.

==Applications==
[[File:Cold-Cathode-CFL-illuminated.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A photo of an illuminated compact fluorescent lamp (CFL) of the cold-cathode variety|An illuminated cold-cathode [[Compact fluorescent lamp|CFL]]]]

Cold cathodes are used in [[cold-cathode rectifier]]s, such as the [[crossatron]] and [[mercury-arc valve]]s, and [[cold-cathode amplifier]]s, such as in [[automatic message accounting]] and other [[pseudospark switch]]ing applications. Other examples include the [[thyratron]], [[krytron]], [[sprytron]], and [[ignitron]] tubes.

A common cold-cathode application is in [[neon sign]]s and other locations where the ambient temperature is likely to drop well below freezing, The [[Clock Tower, Palace of Westminster]] (Big Ben) uses cold-cathode lighting behind the clock faces where continual striking and failure to strike in cold weather would be undesirable. Large cold-cathode fluorescent lamps (CCFLs) have been produced in the past and are still used today when shaped, long-life linear light sources are required. {{As of|2011}}, miniature CCFLs were extensively used as [[backlight]]s for [[computer]] and television [[liquid-crystal display]]s. CCFL lifespans vary in LCD televisions depending on transient voltage surges and temperature levels in usage environments.

Due to its efficiency, CCFL technology has expanded into room lighting. Costs are similar to those of traditional [[fluorescent lighting]],{{Clarify|date=August 2011|reason=is this cost of lamps, running cost, total cost?}} but with several advantages: the light emitted is {{clarify span|easier on the eyes|what?|date=October 2017}}, bulbs turn on instantly to full output and are also dimmable.&lt;ref name="Solé Lighting"&gt;[http://solelighting.com/ Solé Lighting] (commercial site advocating CCFLs).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects of internal heating===
In systems using [[alternating current]] but without separate [[anode]] structures, the electrodes alternate as anodes and cathodes, and the impinging electrons can cause substantial localized heating, often to [[red heat]]. The electrode may take advantage of this heating to facilitate the thermionic emission of electrons when it is acting as a cathode. (''Instant-start'' fluorescent lamps employ this aspect; they start as cold-cathode devices, but soon localized heating of the fine [[tungsten]]-wire cathodes causes them to operate in the same mode as [[hot-cathode]] lamps.)

This aspect is problematic in the case of backlights used for [[liquid-crystal display|LCD]] TV displays. New energy-efficiency regulations being proposed in many countries will require variable backlighting; variable backlightling also improves the perceived contrast range, which is desirable for LCD TV sets. However, CCFLs are strictly limited in the degree to which they can be dimmed, both because a lower plasma current will lower the temperature of the cathode, causing erratic operation, and because running the cathode at too low a temperature drastically shortens the life of the lamps.{{cn|date=November 2015}} Much research is being directed to this problem{{By whom|date=August 2013}}, but high-end manufacturers are now turning to high-efficiency white [[LED]]s as a better solution.

[[Image:Cebhomes.jpg|thumb|Building a CEB project in Midland, Texas in August 2006]]
A '''compressed earth block''' ('''CEB'''), also known as a ''pressed earth block'' or a ''compressed soil block'', is a [[building material]] made primarily from damp [[soil]] compressed at high pressure to form blocks. Compressed earth blocks use a mechanical press to form blocks out of an appropriate mix of fairly dry inorganic [[subsoil]], non-expansive [[clay]] and [[Construction aggregate|aggregate]]. If the blocks are stabilized with a chemical binder such as [[Portland cement]] they are called ''compressed stabilized earth block'' (CSEB) or ''stabilized earth block'' (SEB). Typically, around {{convert|3000|psi|MPa|abbr=on}} is applied in compression, and the original soil volume is reduced by about half.

Creating CEBs differs from [[rammed earth]] in that the latter uses a larger formwork into which earth is poured and manually tamped down, creating larger forms such as a whole wall or more at one time rather than building blocks. CEBs differ from [[mud brick]]s in that the latter are not compressed and solidify through chemical changes that take place as they air dry. The compression strength of properly made CEB can meet or exceed that of typical cement or mud brick. Building standards have been developed for CEB.

CEBs are assembled onto walls using standard [[bricklaying]] and [[masonry]] techniques. The [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] may be a simple [[slurry]] made of the same soil/clay mix without aggregate, spread or brushed very thinly between the blocks for bonding, or cement mortar may also be used for high strength, or when construction during freeze-thaw cycles causes stability issues. [[Hydraform block]]s are shaped to be interlocking.

==Development==
CEB technology has been developed  for low-cost construction, as an alternative to adobe, and with some advantages.  A commercial industry has been advanced by eco-friendly contractors, manufacturers of the mechanical presses, and by cultural acceptance of the method.  In the [[United States]], most general contractors building with CEB are in the Southwestern states: [[New Mexico]], [[Colorado]], [[Arizona]], [[California]], and to a lesser extent in [[Texas]].  The methods and presses have been used for many years in [[Mexico]], and in [[developing countries]].

The [[South Africa]]n Department of Water Affairs and Forestry considers that CEB, locally called "'''Dutch brick'''" is an appropriate technology for a developing country, as are adobe, rammed earth and cob. All use natural building materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|page=6|url=http://www.dwaf.gov.za/Masibambane/documents/civil/CrossCuttingFeb08.pdf|accessdate=2014-04-14|title=Critical Sustainability Pillars for service delivery in the Water Sector|publisher=Department of Water Affairs and Forestry, South Africa|date=February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2002 the International Institute for Energy Conservation was one of the winners of a [[World Bank Development Marketplace Award]] for a project to make an energy-efficient Dutch brick-making machine for home construction in South Africa. By making cheaper bricks that use earth, the project would reduce housing costs while stimulating the building industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/report/29725/south-africa-poverty-reduction-winners|accessdate=2014-04-14|title=SOUTH AFRICA: Poverty reduction winners|publisher=IRIN|date=11 January 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The machine would be mobile, allowing bricks to be made locally from earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wbi.worldbank.org/wbdm/idea/housing-and-jobs-better-future|accessdate=2014-04-14|title=Housing and Jobs for a Better Future|publisher=[[World Bank]]|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various types of CEB production machines exist, from manual to semi-automated and fully automated,  with increasing capital-investment and production rates, and decreased labor.  Automated machines are more common in the developed world, and manual machines in the developing world.

==Advantages==
There are many advantages of the CEB system.   On-site materials can be used, which reduces cost, minimizes shipping costs for materials, and increases efficiency and sustainability.  The wait-time required to obtain materials is minimal, because after the blocks are pressed, materials are available very soon after a short drying period.  The uniformity of the blocks simplifies construction, and minimizes or eliminates the need for mortar, thus reducing both the labor and materials costs.  The blocks are strong, stable, water-resistant and long-lasting.
* CEB can be pressed from damp earth. Because it is not wet, the drying time is much shorter. Some soil conditions permit the blocks to go straight from the press onto the wall. A single mechanical press can produce from 800 to over 5,000 blocks per day, enough to build a {{convert|1200|sqft|m2}} house in one day.   A high performance CEB press, of [[open source]] design, named "The Liberator", can produce from 8,000 to 17,000 or more blocks per day.  The production rate is limited more by the ability to get material into the machine, than the machine itself.
* Shipping cost: Suitable soils are often available at or near the construction site. [[Adobe]] and CEB are of similar weight, but distance from a source supply gives CEB an advantage.  Also, CEB can be made available in places where adobe manufacturing operations are non-existent.
* Uniformity: CEB can be manufactured to a predictable size and has true flat sides and 90-degree angle edges.  This makes design and costing easier.  This also provides the contractor the option of making the exteriors look like conventional [[stucco]] houses. 
* Presses allow blocks to be consistently made of uniform size, while also obtaining strengths that exceed the ASTM standard for concrete blocks (1900 psi).
* Non-toxic:  materials are completely natural, non-toxic, and do not out-gas
* Sound resistant:  an important feature in high-density neighborhoods, residential areas adjacent to industrial zones
* Fire resistant:  earthen walls do not burn
* Insect resistant: Insects are discouraged because the walls are solid and very dense, and have no food value
* [[Mold]] resistant:  there is no cellulose material - such as in wood, [[Oriented Strand Board]] or [[drywall]] - that can host [[mold]] or rot
* In India, CSEB's with cement stabilization have shown to be very beneficial. The observed compressive strength, flexural strength at 28 days of aging with 9% cement stabilization has been observed to be 3.2 MPa and 1 MPa respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267637559|accessdate=2014-11-11|title=Effect Of Varying Cement Proportions On Properties Of Compressed Stabilized Earth Blocks (CSEB) - A Sustainable Low-Cost Housing Material|publisher=DOI: 10.13140/2.1.4966.4963 Conference: International Conference on Sustainable Civil Infrastructure, ASCE India Section 17–18 October 2014, At Hyderabad, India, Volume: pg 1000-1010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presses==
CEB had very limited use prior to the 1980s. It was known in the 1950s in [[South America]], where one of the most well-known presses, the [[Cinva Ram]], was developed by Raul Ramirez in the Inter-American Housing Center (CINVA) in Bogota, Colombia.  The Cinva Ram is a single-block, manual-press that uses a long, hand-operated lever to drive a [[cam]], generating high pressure.

Industrial manufacturers produce much larger machines that run with diesel or gasoline engines and hydraulic presses that receive the soil/aggregate mixture through a hopper. This is fed into a chamber to create a block that is then ejected onto a conveyor.

During the 1980s, soil-pressing technology became widespread. [[France]], [[England]], [[Germany]], [[South Africa]] and [[Switzerland]] began to write standards. The [[Peace Corps]], [[USAID]], [[Habitat for Humanity]] and other programs began to implement it into housing projects.

==Finishing==
Completed walls require either a reinforced bond beam or a ring beam on top or between floors and if the blocks are not stabilized, a plaster finish, usually stucco wire/stucco cement and/or lime plaster. Stabilized blocks can be left exposed with no outer plaster finish. In tropical environments, polycarbonate varnish is often used to provide an additional layer of wet-weather protection.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Foundations==
Standards for foundations are similar to those for brick walls. A CEB wall is heavy. Footings must be at least 10&amp;nbsp;inches thick, with a minimum width that is 33 percent greater than the wall width. If a stem wall is used, it shall extend to an elevation not less than eight inches (203&amp;nbsp;mm)  above the exterior finish grade. Rubble-filled foundation trench designs with a reinforced concrete grade beam above are allowed to support CEB construction.

==Strength==
Using the [[ASTM]] D1633-00 stabilization standard, a pressed and cured block must be submerged in water for four hours. It is then pulled from the water and immediately subjected to a compression test. The blocks must score at least a 300 [[pound-force per square inch]] (p.s.i) (2 MPa) minimum.  This is a higher standard than for adobe, which must score an ''average'' of at least 300 p.s.i. (2 MPa)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2763">The '''Dukhin number''' ('''{{math|Du}}''') is a dimensionless quantity that characterizes the contribution of the [[surface conductivity]] to various [[electrokinetic]] and electroacoustic effects, as well as to [[electrical conductivity]] and [[permittivity]] of fluid [[heterogeneous]] systems. 

==Overview==
It was introduced by Lyklema in “Fundamentals of Interface and Colloid Science”.&lt;ref&gt;Lyklema, J.J. "Fundamentals of Interface and Colloid Science", vol.2, page.3.208, 1995 {{ISBN|978-0-12-460524-4}}.&lt;!-- 10.1016/S1874-5679(06)80006-1? --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  A recent IUPAC Technical Report used this term explicitly and detailed several means of measurement in physical systems.&lt;ref name='PAC'&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Delgado |first1=A. V. |last2=González-Caballero |first2=F. |last3=Hunter |first3=R. J. |last4=Koopal |first4=L. K. |last5=Lyklema |first5=J.  |year=2005 |title=Measurement and Interpretation of Electrokinetic Phenomena (IUPAC Technical Report) |journal=[[Pure and Applied Chemistry]] |volume=77 |issue=10 |pages=1753–1805 |doi=10.1351/pac200577101753|url=http://digibug.ugr.es/bitstream/10481/29099/1/DelgadoMeasurements.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dukhin number is a ratio of the [[surface conductivity]] &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;\kappa^{\sigma}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt; to the fluid bulk electrical conductivity K&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; multiplied by particle size ''a'':

:&lt;math&gt; {\rm Du} = \frac{\kappa^{\sigma}}{{\Kappa_m}a}.&lt;/math&gt;

There is another expression of this number that is valid when the surface conductivity is associated only with ions motion above the [[slipping plane]] in the [[double layer (interfacial)|double layer]]. In this case, the value of the surface conductivity depends on ζ-potential, which leads to the following expression for the Dukhin number for symmetrical electrolyte with equal ions [[diffusion coefficient]]:

:&lt;math&gt; {\rm Du} = \frac{2(1+3m/z^2)}{{\kappa}a}\left(\mathrm{cosh}\frac{zF\zeta}{2RT}-1\right),&lt;/math&gt;

where the parameter ''m'' characterizes the contribution of [[electro-osmosis]] into motion of ions within the double layer

:&lt;math&gt; m = \frac{2\varepsilon_0\varepsilon_m R^2T^2}{3\eta F^2 D}.&lt;/math&gt;

* ''F'' is [[Faraday constant]]
* ''T'' is [[absolute temperature]]
* ''R'' is [[gas constant]]
* ''C'' is ions concentration in bulk
* ''z'' is [[ion]] [[valence (chemistry)|valency]]
* ζ is [[electrokinetic potential]]
* ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is [[vacuum]] [[dielectric]] [[permittivity]]
* ε&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; is fluid dielectric permittivity
* η is [[dynamic viscosity]]
* ''D'' is [[diffusion coefficient]]

The '''earth pyramids of Ritten''' (German: ''Erdpyramiden am Ritten''; {{lang-it|Piramidi di terra del Renon}} {{IPA-it|piˈraːmidi di ˈtɛrra del reˈnon|}}) are a natural monument that is located on the [[Ritten]], a [[plateau]] not far from [[Bolzano]] in northern Italy. The [[earth pyramids of South Tyrol]] are a fairly widespread phenomenon which are existing in various locations.

&lt;!-- [[File:RittenLehmpyramiden.jpg|left|thumb|Another view of the Pyramids of the Ritten towards Mittelberg]] picture not upright, fj --&gt;
The original name in this area for these earth pyramids is ''Lahntürme'', i.e. landslide towers.&lt;ref&gt;Cfr. Paul Stacul, ''Die erste Erwähnung der Südtiroler Erdpyramiden'' (''The first mention of the South Tyrolean earth pyramides''), in "[[Der Schlern]]", 51, 1977, pp. 675-678.&lt;/ref&gt; They are rather unusual formations of their kind which originate from morainic rocks of glacial origin. The columns of the pyramids may be more or less elongated, and the higher they are the thinner they get, ending usually with a stone cover. These earth pyramids are not static, they are constantly evolving, because their life cycle foresees a continuous [[erosion]], or even a final collapse leaving room for new formations.

In [[South Tyrol]] there are other natural monuments like this such as the [[earth pyramids of Platten]], but the ones of Ritten are considered the parents of them all.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10327">'''Electroacoustic phenomena''' arise when [[ultrasound]] propagates through a [[fluid]] containing [[ions]]. The associated particle motion generates [[electric]] signals because ions have [[electric charge]]. This coupling between ultrasound and [[electric field]] is called electroacoustic phenomena. The fluid might be a simple [[Newtonian liquid]], or complex [[heterogeneous]] [[Dispersion (chemistry)|dispersion]], [[emulsion]] or even a porous body. There are several different electroacoustic effects depending on the nature of the fluid.

*[[Ion vibration current]] (IVI) and potential, an [[electric]] signal that arises when an [[acoustic wave]] propagates through a [[Homogeneous (chemistry)|homogeneous]] fluid.
*[[Streaming vibration current]] (SVI) and potential, an electric signal that arises when an acoustic wave propagates through a porous body in which the pores are filled with fluid.
*[[Colloid vibration current]] (CVI) and potential, an electric signal that arises when ultrasound propagates through a [[heterogeneous]] fluid, such as a [[Dispersion (chemistry)|dispersion]] or [[emulsion]].
*[[Electric sonic amplitude]] (ESA), the inverse of the CVI effect, in which an acoustic field arises when an [[electric field]] propagates through a [[heterogeneous]] fluid.

==Ion vibration current==
{{main|Ion vibration current}}
Historically, the IVI was the first known electroacoustic effect. It was predicted by Debye in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;Debye.P."A method for the determination of the mass of electrolyte ions"J. Chem. Phys., 1,13-16,1933&lt;/ref&gt;

==Streaming vibration current==
{{main|Streaming vibration current}}
The streaming vibration current was experimentally observed in 1948 by Williams.&lt;ref&gt;Williams.M. " An Electrokinetic Transducer" The review of scientific instruments, 19, 10, 640-646, 1948&lt;/ref&gt; A theoretical model was developed some 30 years later by Dukhin and others.&lt;ref&gt;Dukhin, S.S., Mischuk, N.A., Kuz'menko, B.B and Il'in, B.I. "Flow current and potential in a high-frequency acoustic field" Colloid J., 45, 5, 875-881,1983&lt;/ref&gt; This effect opens another possibility for characterizing the electric properties of the surfaces in porous bodies. A similar effect can be observed at a non-porous surface, when sound is bounced off at an oblique angle. The incident and reflected waves superimpose to cause oscillatory fluid motion in the plane of the interface, thereby generating an AC streaming current at the frequency of the sound waves.&lt;ref&gt;Glauser, A.R., Robertson P.A., Lowe, C.R., "An electrokinetic sensor for studying immersed surfaces, using focused ultrasound" Sensors Actuators B, 80, 1, 68-82, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

==Double layer compression==
The [[electrical double layer]] can be regarded as behaving like a parallel plate capacitor with a compressible dielectric filling. When sound waves induce a local pressure variation, the spacing of the plates varies at the frequency of the excitation, generating an AC displacement current normal to the interface. For practical reasons this is most readily observed at a conducting surface.&lt;ref&gt;F.I. Kukoz, L.A. Kukoz, "The nature of audioelectro-chemical phenomena" Russ. J. Phys. Chem. 36 (1962) pp. 367-369&lt;/ref&gt; It is therefore possible to use an electrode immersed in a conducting electrolyte as a microphone, or indeed as a loudspeaker when the effect is applied in reverse.&lt;ref&gt;N. Tankovsky, "Capacitive ultrasound transducer, based on the electrical double layer in electrolytes" J. App. Phys. 87 (2000) pp. 538-542&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colloid vibration potential and current==
{{main|Colloid vibration current}}
Colloid vibration potential measures the AC potential difference generated between two identical relaxed electrodes, placed in the dispersion, if the latter is subjected to an ultrasonic field. When a sound wave travels through a colloidal suspension of particles whose density differs from that of the surrounding medium, inertial forces induced by the vibration of the suspension give rise to a motion of the charged particles relative to the liquid, causing an alternating electromotive force. The manifestations of this electromotive force may be measured, depending on the relation between the impedance of the suspension and that of the measuring instrument, either as colloid vibration potential or as ''colloid vibration current''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Colloid vibration potential and current was first reported by Hermans and then independently by Rutgers in 1938. It is widely used for characterizing the ζ-potential of various dispersions and emulsions. The effect, theory, experimental verification and multiple applications are discussed in the book by Dukhin and Goetz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dukhin |first=A.S. |authorlink= |author2=Goetz, P.J. |title=Ultrasound for Characterizing Colloids |accessdate=2007-10-03 |date=2002 |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |pages=153 |chapter=Electroacoustic Theory |chapterurl=http://www.dispersion.com/pages/theory/electroacoustictheory/electoracoustictheory.html |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electric sonic amplitude==
{{main|Electric sonic amplitude}}
Electric sonic amplitude was experimentally discovered by Cannon with co-authors in early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Oja, T., Petersen, G., and Cannon, D. "Measurement of Electric-Kinetic Properties of a Solution", US Patent 4,497,208,1985&lt;/ref&gt; It is also widely used for characterizing ζ-potential in dispersions and emulsions. There is review of this effect theory, experimental verification and multiple applications published by Hunter.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, R.J. "Review. Recent developments in the electroacoustic characterization of colloidal suspensions and emulsions", Colloids and Surfaces, 141, 37-65, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory of CVI and ESA==
With regard to the theory of CVI and ESA, there was an important observation made by O'Brien,&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, R.W. "Electro-acoustic effects in a dilute suspension of spherical particles" J. Fluid Mech., 190, 71-86,1988&lt;/ref&gt; who linked these measured parameters with [[dynamic electrophoretic mobility]] μ&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt; \ CVI(ESA) = A\phi\mu_d\frac{\rho_p-\rho_m}{\rho_m}&lt;/math&gt;

where
: A is calibration constant, depending on frequency, but not particles properties;
: ρ&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; is particle density,
: ρ&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; density of the fluid,
: φ is volume fraction of dispersed phase,

Dynamic electrophoretic mobility is similar to [[electrophoretic mobility]] that appears in [[electrophoresis]] theory. They are identical at low frequencies and/or for sufficiently small particles.

There are several theories of the dynamic electrophoretic mobility. Their overview is given in the Ref.5. Two of them are the most important.

The first one corresponds to the Smoluchowski limit. It yields following simple expression for CVI for sufficiently small particles with negligible CVI frequency dependence:

:&lt;math&gt; \ CVI(ESA) = A\phi\frac{\varepsilon_0\varepsilon_m\zeta\Kappa_s}{\eta\Kappa_m}\frac{\rho_p-\rho_s}{\rho_s}&lt;/math&gt;

where:
: ε&lt;sub&gt;''0''&lt;/sub&gt; is vacuum dielectric permittivity,
: ε&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; is fluid dielectric permittivity,
: ζ is [[electrokinetic potential]]
: η is dynamic viscosity of the fluid,
: K&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; is conductivity of the system,
: K&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; is conductivity of the fluid,
: ρ&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; is density of the system.

This remarkably simple equation has same wide range of applicability as Smoluchowski equation  for [[electrophoresis]]. It is independent on shape of the particles, their concentration.

Validity of this equation is restricted with the following two requirements.
  
First, it is valid only for a thin [[Double layer (interfacial)|double layer]], when the [[Debye length]] is much smaller than particle's radius a:
:&lt;math&gt; {\kappa}a &gt;&gt; 1&lt;/math&gt;

Secondly, it neglects the contribution of the [[surface conductivity]]. This assumes a small [[Dukhin number]]:
:&lt;math&gt; Du &lt;&lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;

Restriction of the thin double layer limits applicability of this Smoluchowski type theory only to aqueous systems with sufficiently large particles and not very low ionic strength. This theory does not work well for nano-colloids, including proteins and polymers at low ionic strength. It is not valid for low- or non-polar fluids.

There is another theory that is applicable for the other extreme case of a thick double layer, when  
:&lt;math&gt; {\kappa}a &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;

This theory takes into consideration the double layer overlap that inevitably occurs for concentrated systems with thick double layer. This allows introduction of so-called "quasi-homogeneous" approach, when overlapped diffuse layers of particles cover the complete interparticle space. The theory becomes much simplified in this extreme case, as shown by Shilov and others.&lt;ref&gt;Shilov, V.N., Borkovskaya, Y.B. and Dukhin A.S. "Electroacoustic theory for concentrated colloids with overlapped DLs at arbitrary ka. Application to nanocolloids and nonaqueous colloids". JCIS, 277, 347-358 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Their derivation predicts that surface charge density σ is a better parameter than ζ-potential for characterizing electroacoustic phenomena in such systems. An expression for CVI simplified for small particles follows:

:&lt;math&gt; \ CVI = A\frac{2{\sigma}a}{3\eta}\frac{\phi}{1-\phi}\frac{\rho_p-\rho_s}{\rho_s}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3864">'''Energoland''' is an information centre for energy and electricity generation which was opened by [[Slovenské elektrárne]] on 14 October 2014 at [[Mochovce]], [[Slovakia]], at the site of the nuclear power plant. It is situated between Levice and Nitra. The centre mainly serves the schools and public. The entry is free of charge.&lt;ref&gt;http://energoland.seas.sk/reservations&lt;/ref&gt; The exposition was awarded as an excellent communication project at the PIME conference and evaluated as a five-star training centre by Laura Elizabeth Kennedy, governor of the United States of America in the Board of Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna and chargé d'affaires of permanent representation of the USA in international organisation in Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seas.sk/article/iaea-governor-energoland-is-a-5-star-education-centre/156&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exposition ==
In Energoland, there are more than thirty objects, applications, and interactive expositions. Edutainment (blending education and entertainment) at Mochovce offers information on energy, electricity generation, global warming, and carbon burden. In addition, visitors learn about the energy mix, electricity grid dispatching, or about the radiation around us. The exposition also focuses on power industry, not only with respect to safety and radioactive waste but also dealing with the fuel cycle, nanowolrd of atoms, and Cherenkov radiation. Some of the specialities include the 3D cinema with its own movie Energy Odyssey, a model of emission-free motorcycle, interactive LED floor or thermal mirror, and mobile application using augmented reality, "Energoland",&lt;ref&gt;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.sk.strategic.EnergolandAR&lt;/ref&gt; downloadable from Google Play or AppStore. Through the Energy Map, various facts and statistics can be searched which are directly shown in the map of the world with the highlighted countries.
Energoland also wants its visitors to make their own opinion of the electricity generation and its sources. Therefore, it does not provide information only about nuclear energy but it also brings knowledge about other sources: water, sun, wind, geothermal energy, or fossil fuels.&lt;ref&gt;http://energoland.seas.sk/exposition&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seas.sk/article/energoland-opened-by-slovenske-elektrarne/119&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seas.sk/gallery/energoland-new-dimension-of-entertainment&lt;/ref&gt;

== Construction of Energoland ==
The design of the building is the work of Ing. arch. Viktor Šabík (BARAK Architekti) who, together with the QEX Company and Italian agency Piter Design, designed the interior of Energoland, as well.[2] The total area of the building, including the training rooms and offices is 2,000 square metres; the info centre itself takes up the area of 600 m2.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seas.sk/data/education/126/file/cfakepathe-atom-10-14.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other Activities ==
Energoland is not only a visitor and information centre; it also serves as a training centre for the employees of Slovenské elektrárne and provides office areas. There are many events for the employees of Slovenské elektrárne or public taking place here, such as the 90 reactor-years anniversary,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seas.sk/article/90-reaktorrokov-jadrovych-blokov-slovenskych-elektrarni/140&lt;/ref&gt; programme within the national round of Olympics in Physics,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seas.sk/article/mladi-fyzici-na-olympiade-v-atomovej-elektrarni/162&lt;/ref&gt; Science Talks during the Science and Technology Week,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seas.sk/article/slovenske-elektrarne-hlavnym-partnerom-tvt/130&lt;/ref&gt; Sustainable Development Conference in May 2015, etc.

The English noun '''''evolution''''' (from [[Latin]]  {{lang|la|ēvolūtiō}} "unfolding, unrolling") refers to any kind of accumulation of change, or gradual directional change. It is the 3,117th most commonly used word in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Evolution|url=http://www.forgottenbooks.com/worddata/evolution|website=Word Data|accessdate=24 October 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117021424/http://www.forgottenbooks.com/worddata/evolution|archivedate=17 November 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the term primarily refers to [[biology|biological]] [[evolution]], there are various types of [[Chemistry|chemical]] evolution and it is also found in economics, historical linguistics, and many other technical fields where [[system]]s develop or change gradually over time, e.g.  [[stellar evolution]], [[cultural evolution]],  the [[evolution of an idea]], [[evolution (philosophy)|metaphysical evolution]], [[spiritual evolution]], etc.

The English term prior to the late 19th century was confined to referring to goal-directed, pre-programmed processes such as [[embryological development]]. A pre-programmed task, as in a military [[:wikt:maneuver|maneuver]], using this definition, may be termed an "evolution."  

The term ''evolution'' (from its literal meaning of "unfolding" of something into its true or explicit form) carries a connotation of gradual improvement or directionality from a beginning to an end point. This contrasts with the more general [[:wikt:development|development]], which can indicate change in any direction, or [[revolution]], which implies recurring, periodic change. The term  [[biological devolution]] is coined as an antonym to ''evolution'', indicating such degeneration or decrease in quality or complexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Evolution|url=http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=evolution&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|website=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=24 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cochlea''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|oʊ|k|l|i|ə}} is Latin for “snail, shell or screw” and originates from the Greek word κοχλίας ''kohlias''. The modern definition, the auditory portion of the [[inner ear]], originated in the late 17th century. Within the mammalian cochlea exists the [[organ of Corti]], which contains [[hair cell]]s that are responsible for translating the vibrations it receives from surrounding fluid-filled ducts into [[electrical impulse]]s that are sent to the brain to process sound.&lt;ref name=Dugdale /&gt; This spiral-shaped cochlea is estimated to have originated during the early [[Cretaceous Period]], around 120 million years ago.&lt;ref name=Manley /&gt; Further, the auditory innervation of the spiral-shaped cochlea also traces back to the Cretaceous period.&lt;ref name=Luo /&gt; The evolution of the human cochlea is a major area of scientific interest because of its favourable representation in the [[fossil]] record.&lt;ref name=Clack /&gt; During the last century, many scientists such as evolutionary biologists and paleontologists strove to develop new methods and techniques to overcome the many obstacles associated with working with ancient, delicate artifacts.&lt;ref name=Manley /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ladeveze /&gt;&lt;ref name=Armstrong /&gt; In the past, scientists were limited in their ability to fully examine specimens without causing damage to them.&lt;ref name=Manley /&gt; In more recent times, technologies such as micro-CT scanning became available.&lt;ref name=Ladeveze /&gt; These technologies allow for the visual differentiation between fossilized animal materials and other sedimentary remains.&lt;ref name=Manley /&gt; With the use of X-ray technologies, it is possible to ascertain some information about the auditory capabilities of extinct creatures, giving insight to human ancestors as well as their contemporary species.&lt;ref name=Armstrong /&gt;

== Comparative anatomy ==
While the basic structure of the inner ear in [[lepidosaurs]] (lizards and snakes), [[archosaurs]] (birds and crocodilians) and [[mammals]] is similar, and the organs are considered to be homologous, each group has a unique type of auditory organ.&lt;ref name=Manley /&gt; The hearing organ arose within the lagenar duct of stem reptiles, lying between the saccular and lagenar epithelia. In lepidosaurs, the hearing organ, the basilar papilla, is generally small, with at most 2000 hair cells, whereas in archosaurs the basilar papilla can be much longer (&gt;10mm in owls) and contain many more hair cells that show two typical size extremes, the short and the tall hair cells. In mammals, the structure is known as the organ of Corti and shows a unique arrangement of hair cells and supporting cells. All mammalian organs of Corti contain a supporting tunnel made up of pillar cells, on the inner side of which there are inner hair cells and outer hair cells on the outer side. The [[definitive mammalian middle ear]] and the elongated cochlea allows for better sensitivity for higher frequencies.&lt;ref name=Manley /&gt;

=== Lepidosaurs ===
As in all lepidosaurs and archosaurs, the single-ossicle (columellar) middle ear transmits sound to the footplate of the columella, which sends a pressure wave through the inner ear. In snakes, the basilar papilla is roughly 1mm long and only responds to frequencies below about 1&amp;nbsp;kHz. In contrast, lizards tend to have two areas of hair cells, one responding below and the other above 1&amp;nbsp;kHz. The upper frequency limit in most lizards is roughly 5–8&amp;nbsp;kHz. The longest lizard papillae are about 2mm long and contain 2000 hair cells and their afferent innervating fibers can be very sharply tuned to frequency.&lt;ref name=Manley2 /&gt;

=== Archosaurs ===
In birds and crocodilians, the similarity of the structure of the [[basilar papilla]] betrays their close evolutionary relationship. The basilar papilla is up to about 10mm long and contains up to 16500 hair cells. While most birds have an upper hearing limit of only about 6&amp;nbsp;kHz, the barn owl can hear up to 12&amp;nbsp;kHz and thus close to the human upper limit.&lt;ref name=Koeppl /&gt;

=== Mammals ===
{{See also|Evolution of mammalian auditory ossicles}}
Egg-laying mammals, the monotremes (spiny anteater and platypus), do not have a spiral cochlea, but one shaped more like a banana, up to about 7&amp;nbsp;mm long. Like in lepidosaurs and archosaurs, it contains a lagena, a vestibular sensory epithelium, at its tip. Only in therian mammals (marsupials and placentals) is the cochlea truly coiled 1.5 to 3.5 times. Whereas in monotremes there are many rows of both inner and outer hair cells in the organ of Corti, in therian (marsupial and placental) mammals the number of inner hair-cell rows is one, and there are generally only three rows of outer hair cells.&lt;ref name=Manley2 /&gt;

=== Amphibians ===
Amphibians have unique inner ear structures. There are two sensory papillae involved in hearing, the basilar (higher frequency) and amphibian (lower frequency) papillae, but it is uncertain whether either is homologous to the hearing organs of lepidosaurs, archosaurs and mammals and we have no idea when they arose.&lt;ref name=Romer /&gt;

=== Fish ===
Fish have no dedicated auditory epithelium, but use various vestibular sensory organs that respond to sound. In most teleost fishes it is the saccular macula that responds to sound. In some, such as goldfishes, there is also a special bony connection to the gas bladder that increases sensitivity allowing hearing up to about 4&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref name=Romer /&gt;

=== Neanderthals to modern humans ===
The size of cochlea has been measured throughout its evolution based on the fossil record. In one study, the basal turn of the cochlea was measured, and it was hypothesized that cochlear size correlates with body mass. The size of the basal turn of the cochlea was not different in Neanderthals and Holocene humans, however it became larger in early modern humans and Upper Paleolithic humans. Furthermore, the position and orientation of the cochlea is similar between Neanderthals and Holocene humans, relative to plane of the lateral canal, whereas early modern and upper Paleolithic humans have a more superiorly placed cochlea than Holocene humans. When comparing hominins of the Middle Pleistocene and Neanderthals and Holocene humans, the apex of the cochlea faces more inferiorly in the hominins than the latter two groups. Finally, the cochlea of European middle Pleistocene hominins faces more inferiorly than Neanderthals, modern humans, and Homo erectus.&lt;ref name=Spoor /&gt;
Human beings, along with Apes, are the only mammals that do not have high frequency (&gt;32&amp;nbsp;kHz) hearing.&lt;ref name=Spoor /&gt; Humans have long cochleae, but the space devoted to each frequency range is quite large (2.5mm per octave), resulting in a comparatively reduced upper frequency limit.&lt;ref name=Manley /&gt; The human cochlea has approximately 2.5 turns around the modiolus (the axis).&lt;ref name=Manley /&gt; Humans, like many mammals and birds, are able to perceive auditory signals that displace the eardrum by a mere picometre.&lt;ref name=Drake /&gt;

== The ear ==
Because of its prominence and preserved state in the fossil record, until recently, the ear had been used to determine phylogeny.&lt;ref name=Clack /&gt; The ear itself contains different portions, including the outer ear, the middle ear, and the inner ear and all of these show evolutionary changes that are often unique to each lineage [14]. It was the independent evolution of a tympanic middle ear in the Triassic era that produced strong selection pressures towards improved hearing organs in the separate lineages of land vertebrates.&lt;ref name=Clack /&gt;

=== Evolutionary perspective ===
The cochlea is the tri-chambered auditory detection portion of the ear, consisting of the scala media, the scala tympani, and the scala vestibuli.&lt;ref name=Romer /&gt; Regarding mammals, placental and marsupial cochleae have similar cochlear responses to auditory stimulation as well as DC resting potentials.&lt;ref name=Fernandez /&gt; This leads to the investigation of the relationship between these therian mammals and researching their ancestral species to trace the origin of the cochlea.&lt;ref name=Manley /&gt;

This spiral-shaped cochlea that is in both marsupial and placental mammals is traced back to approximately 120 million years ago.&lt;ref name= Manley /&gt; The development of the most basic basilar papilla (the auditory organ that later evolved into the Organ of Corti in mammals) happened at the same time as the water-to-land transition of vertebrates, approximately 380 million years ago.&lt;ref name=Manley2 /&gt; The actual coiling or spiral nature of the cochlea occurred to save space inside the skull.&lt;ref name=Luo /&gt; The longer the cochlea, the higher is the potential resolution of sound frequencies given the same hearing range.&lt;ref name=Luo /&gt; The oldest of the truly coiled mammalian cochleae were approximately 4&amp;nbsp;mm in length.&lt;ref name=Manley /&gt;

The earliest evidence available for primates depicts a short cochlea with prominent laminae, suggesting that they had good high-frequency sensitivity as opposed to low-frequency sensitivity.&lt;ref name=Coleman /&gt; After this, over a period of around 60 million years, evidence suggests that primates developed longer cochleae and less prominent laminae, which means that they had an improvement in low-frequency sensitivity and a decrease in high-frequency sensitivity.&lt;ref name=Coleman /&gt; By the early Miocene period, the cycle of the elongation of the cochleae and the deterioration of the laminae was completed.&lt;ref name=Coleman /&gt; Evidence shows that primates have had an increasing cochlear volume to body mass ratio over time.&lt;ref name=Luo /&gt; These changes in the cochlear labyrinth volume negatively affect the highest and lowest audible frequencies, causing a downward shift.&lt;ref name=Luo /&gt; Non-primates appear to have smaller cochlear labyrinth volumes overall when compared to primates.&lt;ref name=Luo /&gt; Some evidence also suggests that selective forces for the larger cochlear labyrinth may have started after the basal primate node.&lt;ref name=Luo /&gt;
 
Mammals are the subject of a substantial amount of research not only because of the potential knowledge to be gained regarding humans, but also because of their rich and abundant representation in the fossil record.&lt;ref name=Luo2 /&gt; The spiral shape of the cochlea evolved later on in the evolutionary pathway of mammals than previously believed, just before the therians split into the two lineages marsupials and placentals, about 120 million years ago.&lt;ref name=Manley  /&gt;

=== The evolution of prestins ===

Parallel to the evolution of the cochlea, [[prestins]] show an increased rate of evolution in therian mammals. Prestins are located in the outer hair cells of mammalian cochlea and are considered motor proteins. They are found in the hair cells of all vertebrates, including fish, but are thought to have initially been membrane transporter molecules. A high concentration of prestins are found only in the lateral membranes of therian outer hair cells (there is uncertainty with regard to concentrations in monotremes). This high concentration is not found in inner hair cells, and is also lacking in all hair cell types of non-mammals.&lt;ref name=Koeppl2 /&gt;  Prestin also has a role in motility, which evolved a greater importance in the motor function in land vertebrates, but this developed vastly differently in different lineages. In certain birds and mammals, prestins function as both transporters and motors, but the strongest evolution to robust motor dynamics only evolved in therian mammals. It is hypothesized that this motor system is significant to the therian cochlea at high frequencies because of the distinctive cellular and bony composition of the organ of Corti that allows the prestins to intensify movements of the whole structure.&lt;ref name=Manley /&gt;
Modern ultra-sound echolocating species such as bats and toothed whales show highly evolved prestins, and these prestins show identical sequence alterations over time. Unusually, the sequences thus apparently evolved independent from each other during different time periods. Furthermore, the evolution of neurotransmitter receptor systems (acetylcholine) that regulate the motor feedback of the outer hair cells coincides with prestin evolution in therians. This suggests that there was a parallel evolution of a control system and a motor system in the inner ear of therian mammals.&lt;ref name=Manley2 /&gt;

=== Homoplasies (convergent evolution) ===
Land vertebrates evolved middle ears independently in each major lineage, and are this the result of parallel evolution.&lt;ref name=Manley2 /&gt; The configurations of the middle ears of monotreme and therian mammals can thus be interpreted as convergent evolution or homoplasy.&lt;ref name=Luo2 /&gt; Thus evidence from fossils demonstrate homoplasies for the detachment of the ear from the jaw.&lt;ref name=Luo2 /&gt; Furthermore, it is apparent that the land-based eardrum, or tympanic membrane, and connecting structures such as the Eustachian tube evolved convergently in multiple different settings as opposed to being a defining morphology.&lt;ref name=Kitazawa /&gt;

{{Use mdy dates|date=January 2012}}
In [[computer science]], '''evolutionary computation''' is a family of [[algorithm]]s for [[global optimization]] inspired by [[biological evolution]], and the subfield of [[artificial intelligence]] and [[soft computing]] studying these algorithms. In technical terms, they are a family of population-based [[trial and error]] problem solvers with a [[metaheuristic]] or [[stochastic optimization]] character.

In evolutionary computation, an initial set of candidate solutions is generated and iteratively updated. Each new generation is produced by stochastically removing less desired solutions, and introducing small random changes. In biological terminology, a [[population]] of solutions is subjected to [[natural selection]] (or [[artificial selection]]) and [[mutation]]. As a result, the population will gradually [[evolution|evolve]] to increase in [[fitness (biology)|fitness]], in this case the chosen [[fitness function]] of the algorithm.

Evolutionary computation techniques can produce highly optimized solutions in a wide range of problem settings, making them popular in [[computer science]]. Many variants and extensions exist, suited to more specific families of problems and data structures. Evolutionary computation is also sometimes used in [[evolutionary biology]] as an ''in silico'' experimental procedure to study common aspects of general evolutionary processes.

== History ==
The use of evolutionary principles for automated problem solving originated in the 1950s. It was not until the 1960s that three distinct interpretations of this idea started to be developed in three different places.

''[[Evolutionary programming]]'' was introduced by [[Lawrence J. Fogel]] in the US, while [[John Henry Holland]] called his method a ''[[genetic algorithm]]''. In Germany [[Ingo Rechenberg]] and [[Hans-Paul Schwefel]] introduced ''[[Evolution strategy|evolution strategies]]''. These areas developed separately for about 15 years. From the early nineties on they are unified as different representatives ("dialects") of one technology, called ''evolutionary computing''. Also in the early nineties, a fourth stream following the general ideas had emerged – ''[[genetic programming]]''. Since the 1990s, nature-inspired algorithms are becoming an increasingly significant part of the evolutionary computation.

These terminologies denote the field of evolutionary computing and consider evolutionary programming, evolution strategies, genetic algorithms, and genetic programming as sub-areas.

Simulations of [[evolution]] using [[evolutionary algorithm]]s and [[artificial life]] started with the work of Nils Aall Barricelli in the 1960s, and was extended by [[Alex Fraser (scientist)|Alex Fraser]], who published a series of papers on simulation of [[artificial selection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fraser AS |title=Monte Carlo analyses of genetic models |journal=Nature |volume=181 |issue=4603 |pages=208–9 |year=1958 |pmid=13504138 |doi=10.1038/181208a0 |ref=harv|bibcode=1958Natur.181..208F }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Evolutionary algorithm|Artificial evolution]] became a widely recognised optimisation method as a result of the work of [[Ingo Rechenberg]] in the 1960s and early 1970s, who used [[Evolution strategy|evolution strategies]] to solve complex engineering problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rechenberg |first=Ingo |year=1973 |title=Evolutionsstrategie&amp;nbsp;– Optimierung technischer Systeme nach Prinzipien der biologischen Evolution (PhD thesis) |publisher=Fromman-Holzboog|language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Genetic algorithm]]s in particular became popular through the writing of [[John Henry Holland|John Holland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Holland |first=John H. |year=1975 |title=Adaptation in Natural and Artificial Systems|publisher=[[University of Michigan Press]]|isbn = 0-262-58111-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; As academic interest grew, dramatic increases in the power of computers allowed practical applications, including the automatic evolution of computer programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Koza|first=John R. |year=1992 |title=Genetic Programming: On the Programming of Computers by Means of Natural Selection|publisher=[[MIT Press]] |isbn=0-262-11170-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evolutionary algorithms are now used to solve multi-dimensional problems more efficiently than software produced by human designers, and also to optimise the design of systems.&lt;ref&gt;G.

== Evolutionary algorithms ==
{{Main article|Evolutionary algorithm}}
[[Evolutionary algorithms]] form a subset of evolutionary computation in that they generally only involve techniques implementing mechanisms inspired by [[biological evolution]] such as [[reproduction]], [[mutation]], [[Genetic recombination|recombination]], [[natural selection]] and [[survival of the fittest]]. [[Candidate solutions]] to the optimization problem play the role of individuals in a population, and the [[Loss function|cost function]] determines the environment within which the solutions "live" (see also [[fitness function]]). [[Evolution]] of the population then takes place after the repeated application of the above operators.

In this process, there are two main forces that form the basis of evolutionary systems:  '''Recombination''' and '''mutation''' create the necessary diversity and thereby facilitate novelty, while '''selection''' acts as a force increasing quality.

Many aspects of such an evolutionary process are [[stochastic]]. Changed pieces of information due to recombination and mutation are randomly chosen. On the other hand, selection operators can be either deterministic, or stochastic. In the latter case, individuals with a higher [[Fitness function|fitness]] have a higher chance to be selected than individuals with a lower [[Fitness function|fitness]], but typically even the weak individuals have a chance to become a parent or to survive.

== Evolutionary algorithms and biology ==
{{Main article|Evolutionary algorithm}}

[[Genetic algorithms]] deliver methods to model [[biological systems]] and [[systems biology]] that are linked to the theory of [[dynamical systems]], since they are used to predict the future states of the system. This is just a vivid (but perhaps misleading) way of drawing attention to the orderly, well-controlled and highly structured character of development in biology.

However, the use of algorithms and informatics, in particular of [[computational theory]], beyond the analogy to dynamical systems, is also relevant to understand evolution itself. 

This view has the merit of recognizing that there is no central control of development; organisms develop as a result of local interactions within and between cells. The most promising ideas about program-development parallels seem to us to be ones that point to an apparently close analogy between processes within cells, and the low-level operation of modern computers &lt;ref&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/information-biological/#InfEvo &lt;/ref&gt;. Thus, biological systems are like computational machines that process input information to compute next states, such that biological systems are closer to a computation than classical dynamical system &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= J.G. Diaz Ochoa |title= Elastic Multi-scale Mechanisms: Computation and Biological Evolution |journal=[[Journal of Molecular Evolution]] |volume=86 |issue=1 |pages=47–57 |year=2018 |pmid=29248946 |doi=10.1007/s00239-017-9823-7 |ref=harv|bibcode=2018JMolE..86...47D }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Furthermore, following concepts from [[computational theory]], micro processes in biological organisms are fundamentally incomplete and undecidable ([[completeness (logic)]]), implying that “there is more than a crude metaphor behind the analogy between cells and computers &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= A. Danchin |title= Bacteria as computers making computers |journal=[[FEMS Microbiol. Rev.]] |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=3–26 |year=2008 |pmid=29248946 |doi=10.1111/j.1574-6976.2008.00137.x |ref=harv|bibcode= |pmc=2704931 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The analogy to computation extends also to the relationship between [[inheritance systems]] and biological structure, which is often thought to reveal one of the most pressing problems in explaining the origins of life.

'''Evolutionary graph theory''' is an area of research lying at the intersection of [[graph theory]], [[probability theory]], and [[mathematical biology]]. Evolutionary graph theory is an approach to studying how [[topology]] affects [[evolution]] of a [[population]]. That the underlying topology can substantially affect the results of the evolutionary process is seen most clearly in a paper by [[Erez Lieberman]], Christoph Hauert and [[Martin Nowak]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lieberman | first1 = E. | last2 = Hauert | first2 = C. | last3 = Nowak | first3 = M. A. | doi = 10.1038/nature03204 | title = Evolutionary dynamics on graphs | journal = Nature | volume = 433 | issue = 7023 | pages = 312–316 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15662424 | pmc = | bibcode = 2005Natur.433..312L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In evolutionary graph theory, individuals occupy [[vertex (graph theory)|vertices]] of a weighted [[directed graph]] and the weight w&lt;sub&gt;i j&lt;/sub&gt; of an [[Edge (graph theory)|edge]] from vertex ''i'' to vertex ''j'' denotes the probability of ''i'' replacing ''j''. The weight corresponds to the biological notion of [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] where fitter types propagate more readily. 
One property studied on graphs with two types of individuals is the ''fixation probability'', which is defined as the probability that a single, randomly placed mutant of type A will replace a population of type B. According to the ''isothermal theorem'', a graph has the same fixation probability as the corresponding [[Moran process]] if and only if it is isothermal, thus the sum of all weights that lead into a vertex is the same for all vertices. Thus, for example, a [[complete graph]] with equal weights describes a Moran process. The fixation probability is
: &lt;math&gt; \begin{align} 
\rho_M = \frac{1-r^{-1}} { 1-r^{-N} } 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''r'' is the relative fitness of the invading type.

Graphs can be classified into amplifiers of selection and suppressors of selection. If the fixation probability of a single advantageous mutation &lt;math&gt; \rho_G &lt;/math&gt; is higher than the fixation probability of the corresponding [[Moran process]] &lt;math&gt; \rho_M &lt;/math&gt; then the graph is an amplifier, otherwise a suppressor of selection. One example of the suppressor of selection is a linear process where only vertex ''i-1'' can replace vertex ''i'' (but not the other way around). In this case the fixation probability is &lt;math&gt; \rho_G = 1/N &lt;/math&gt; (where ''N'' is the number of vertices) since this is the probability that the mutation arises in the first vertex which will eventually replace all the other ones. Since &lt;math&gt; \rho_G &lt; \rho_M &lt;/math&gt; for all ''r'' greater than 1, this graph is by definition a suppressor of selection.

Evolutionary graph theory may also be studied in a dual formulation, as a [[coalescing random walk]], or as a stochastic process.  We may consider the mutant population on a graph as a random walk between absorbing barriers representing mutant extinction and mutant fixation.  For highly symmetric graphs, we can then use martingales to find the ''fixation probability'' as illustrated by Monk (2018).

Also [[Evolutionary game theory|evolutionary games]] can be studied on graphs where again an edge between ''i'' and ''j'' means that these two individuals will play a game against each other.

Closely related stochastic processes include the [[voter model]], which was introduced by Clifford and Sudbury (1973) and independently by Holley and Liggett (1975), and which has been studied extensively.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10152">In [[evolutionary developmental biology]], '''homeosis''' is the transformation of one [[organ (anatomy)|organ]] into another, arising from [[mutation]] in or misexpression of certain developmentally critical [[gene]]s, specifically homeotic genes. In animals, these developmental genes specifically control the development of organs on their anteroposterior axis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Beyond homeosis—HOX function in morphogenesis and organogenesis|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1432-0436.2003.7108004.x/abstract|journal = Differentiation|date = 2003-10-01|issn = 1432-0436|pages = 461–476|volume = 71|issue = 8|doi = 10.1046/j.1432-0436.2003.7108004.x|first = James Castelli-Gair|last = Hombría|first2 = Bridget|last2 = Lovegrove}}&lt;/ref&gt; In plants, however, the developmental genes affected by homeosis may control anything from the development of a [[stamen]] or petals to the development of chlorophyll.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sattler|first=Rolf|date=October 1998|title=Homeosis in Plants|jstor=2444710|journal=American Journal of Botany|volume=75|pages=1606–1617|doi=10.2307/2444710|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Homeosis may be caused by mutations in [[Hox genes]], found in animals, or others such as the [[MADS-box]] family in plants. Homeosis is a characteristic that has helped [[insect]]s become as successful and diverse as they are.&lt;ref&gt;Lodish et al., 2003. ''Molecular Cell Biology, 5th Edition''. W.H. Freeman and Company, New York.{{Page needed|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Homeotic mutations work by changing segment identity during development. For example, the ''[[Ultrabithorax]]'' [[genotype]] gives a [[phenotype]] wherein metathoracic and first [[abdominal]] segments become mesothoracic segments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/287795a0 |title=Mutations affecting segment number and polarity in [[Drosophila]] |year=1980 |last1=Nüsslein-Volhard |first1=Christiane |last2=Wieschaus |first2=Eric |journal=Nature |volume=287 |issue=5785 |pages=795–801 |pmid=6776413|bibcode=1980Natur.287..795N }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another well-known example is ''[[Antennapedia]]'': a [[gain-of-function]] [[allele]] causes legs to develop in the place of [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/325816a0 |title=Redesigning the body plan of [[Drosophila]] by ectopic expression of the homoeotic gene Antennapedia |year=1987 |last1=Schneuwly |first1=Stephan |last2=Klemenz |first2=Roman |last3=Gehring |first3=Walter J. |journal=Nature |volume=325 |issue=6107 |pages=816–818 |pmid=3821869|bibcode=1987Natur.325..816S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Plant morphology|botany]], [[Rolf Sattler]] has revised the concept of homeosis (replacement) by his emphasis on partial homeosis in addition to complete homeosis; this revision is now widely accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=2444710 |pages=1606–1617 |last1=Sattler |first1=R. |title=Homeosis in Plants |volume=75 |issue=10 |journal=American Journal of Botany |year=1988 |doi=10.2307/2444710}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Homeotic mutants in [[angiosperms]] are thought to be rare in the wild: in the annual plant ''[[Clarkia]]'' ([[Onagraceae]]), homeotic mutants are known where the petals are replaced by a second whorl of sepal-like organs, originating via a mutation governed by a single recessive gene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/358671a0 |title=Bicalyx is a natural homeotic floral variant |year=1992 |last1=Ford |first1=V. S. |last2=Gottlieb |first2=L. D. |journal=Nature |volume=358 |issue=6388 |pages=671–673|bibcode=1992Natur.358..671F }}&lt;/ref&gt; The absence of lethal or deleterious consequences in floral mutants resulting in distinct morphological expressions has been a factor in the evolution of Clarkia, and perhaps also in many other plant groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=2461245 |pages=681–709 |last1=Gottlieb |first1=L. D. |title=Genetics and Morphological Evolution in Plants |volume=123 |issue=5 |journal=The American Naturalist |year=1984 |doi=10.1086/284231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Homeotic mechanisms in animals==
Following the work on homeotic mutants by [[Edward B. Lewis|Ed Lewis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A gene complex controlling segmentation in [[Drosophila]] |year=1978 |last1=Lewis |first1=EB |journal=Nature |volume=276 |issue=5688 |pages=565–570 |pmid=103000 |doi=10.1038/276565a0|bibcode=1978Natur.276..565L }}&lt;/ref&gt; the phenomenology of homeosis in [[Metazoa|animals]] was further elaborated by discovery of a conserved DNA binding sequence present in many  homeotic proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A conserved DNA sequence in homoeotic genes of the [[Drosophila]] Antennapedia and bithorax complexes |year=1984 |last1=McGinnis |first1=W |last2=Levine |first2=MS |last3=Hafen |first3=E |last4=Kuroiwa |first4=A |last5=Gehring |first5=WJ  |journal=Nature |volume=308 |issue=5958 |pages=428–433 |pmid=6323992 |doi=10.1038/308428a0|bibcode=1984Natur.308..428M }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Thus, the 60 amino acid DNA binding protein domain was named the [[homeodomain]], while the 180 bp nucleotide sequence encoding it was named the [[homeobox]]. The homeobox gene clusters studied by Ed Lewis were named the [[Hox genes]], although it should be noted that many more homeobox genes are encoded by animal [[genome]]s than those in the Hox gene clusters.

The homeotic-function of certain proteins was first postulated to be that of a "selector" as proposed by [[Antonio Garcia-Bellido]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Genetic control of wing disc development in [[Drosophila]]. |year=1975 |last1=Garcia-Bellido |first1=A |journal=Ciba Found. Symp |volume=0 |pages=161–-182 |pmid=1039909}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
By definition selectors were imagined to be ([[transcription factor]]) proteins that stably determined one of two possible cell fates for a cell and its cellular descendants in a [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]].   
While most animal homeotic functions are associated with homeobox-containing factors, not all homeotic proteins in animals are encoded by homeobox genes, and further not all homeobox genes are necessarily associated with homeotic functions or ([[mutant]]) phenotypes.
The concept of homeotic selectors was further elaborated or at least qualified by [[Michael Akam]] in a so-called "post-selector gene" model that incorporated additional findings and "walked back" the "orthodoxy" of selector-dependent stable binary switches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Hox genes, homeosis and the evolution of segment identity: no need for hopeless monsters.|year=1998 |last1=Akam |first1=M |journal=International Journal of Developmental Biology |volume=42 | pages=445–451 |pmid=9654030}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of [[Compartment (development)|tissue compartments]] is deeply intertwined with the selector model of homeosis because the selector-mediated maintenance of cell fate can be restricted into different organizational units of an animal's [[body plan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Signals and mechanics shaping compartment boundaries in [[Drosophila]] |year=2015 |last1=Umetsu |first1=D |last2=Dahmann |first2=C |journal=Wiley Interdiscip Rev Dev Biol |volume=4 |pages=407–417 |pmid=25755098 |doi=10.1002/wdev.178}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In this context, newer insights into homeotic mechanisms were found by [[Albert Erives]] and colleagues by focusing on [[Enhancer (genetics)|enhancer DNAs]] that are co-targeted by homeotic selectors and different combinations of developmental signals.&lt;ref name=Stroebele/&gt;
This work identifies a protein biochemical difference between the [[transcription factor]]s that function as homeotic selectors versus the [[transcription factor]]s that function as effectors of developmental signaling pathways, such as the [[Notch signaling pathway]] and the [[Transforming growth factor beta superfamily|BMP signaling pathway]].&lt;ref name="Stroebele"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Integration of Orthogonal Signaling by the Notch and Dpp Pathways in Drosophila |year=2016 |last1=Stroebele |first1=E |last2=Erives |first2=A |journal=Genetics |volume=203 |pages=219–240 |pmid=26975664 |doi=10.1534/genetics.116.186791 |pmc=4858776}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This work proposes that homeotic selectors function to "license" [[Enhancer (genetics)|enhancer DNAs]] in a restricted [[Compartment (development)|tissue compartment]] so that the enhancers are enabled to read-out developmental signals, which are then integrated via [[Polyglutamine tract|polyglutamine]]-mediated aggregation.&lt;ref name=Stroebele/&gt;

==Homeotic mechanisms in plants==
Like the complex [[Multicellular organism|multicellularity]] seen in [[animals]], the multicellularity of [[land plants]] is developmentally organized into [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] and [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]] units via [[transcription factor]] genes with homeotic effects.&lt;ref name="Sablowski"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Control of patterning, growth, and differentiation by floral organ identity genes. |year=2015 |last1=Sablowski |first1=R |journal=Journal of Experimental Botany |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=1065–1073 |pmid=25609826 |doi=10.1093/jxb/eru514}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although plants have homeobox-containing genes, plant homeotic factors tend to possess [[MADS-box]] DNA binding domains.
Animal genomes also possess a small number [[MADS-box]] factors.
Thus, in the independent evolution of [[Multicellular organism|multicellularity]] in plants and animals, different [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] transcription factor families were [[Exaptation|co-opted]] to serve homeotic functions. 
MADS-domain factors have been proposed to function as co-factors to more specialized factors and thereby help to determine organ identity.&lt;ref name=Sablowski/&gt;
This has been proposed to correspond more closely to the interpretation of animal homeotics outlined by [[Michael Akam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Hox genes: From master genes to micromanagers |year=1998 |last1=Akam |first1=M |journal=Current Biology |volume=8 |pages=R676 |pmid=9768351 |doi=10.1016/s0960-9822(98)70433-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Industrial melanism''' is an [[evolution]]ary effect prominent in several [[arthropod]]s, where dark [[pigmentation]] ([[melanism]]) has evolved in an environment affected by [[industrial pollution]], including sulphur dioxide gas and dark soot deposits. Sulphur dioxide kills [[lichen]]s, leaving tree [[Bark (botany)|bark]] bare where in clean areas it is boldly patterned, while soot darkens bark and other surfaces. Darker pigmented individuals have a higher fitness in those areas as their [[camouflage]] matches the polluted background better; they are thus favoured by [[natural selection]].  This change, extensively studied by [[Bernard Kettlewell]], is a popular [[Teaching of evolution|teaching example in Darwinian evolution]], providing [[Coloration evidence for natural selection|evidence for natural selection]].&lt;ref name="Majerus2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Majerus |first1=Michael E.

Industrial melanism is widespread in the [[Lepidoptera]] (butterflies and moths), involving over 70 species such as ''[[Odontopera bidentata]]'' (scalloped hazel)&lt;ref name=CookTurner2008&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cook |first1=L.

It is also seen in a beetle, ''[[Adalia bipunctata]]'' (two-spot ladybird), where camouflage is not involved as the insect has conspicuous [[aposematism|warning coloration]], and in the seasnake ''[[Emydocephalus annulatus]]'' where the melanism may help in excretion of trace elements through [[sloughing]] of the skin. The rapid decline of melanism that has accompanied the reduction of pollution, in effect a [[natural experiment]], makes natural selection for camouflage "the only credible explanation".&lt;ref name=CookTurner2008/&gt;

Other explanations for the observed correlation with industrial pollution have been proposed, including strengthening the immune system in a polluted environment, absorbing heat more rapidly when sunlight is reduced by air pollution, and the ability to excrete trace elements into melanic scales and feathers.

==History==
[[File:Biston betularia 20110529 102239 8073M.JPG|thumb|upright|Intermediate ''insularia'' form (between pale ''typica'' and dark ''carbonaria'' in tone) of peppered moth on a [[lichen]]-covered [[birch]] tree: [[Bernard Kettlewell]] counted the frequencies of all three forms.&lt;ref name=Kettlewell1955/&gt;]]

Industrial melanism was first noticed in 1900 by the geneticist [[William Bateson]]; he observed that the colour morphs were inherited, but did not suggest an explanation for the [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]].&lt;ref name=CookTurner2008/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bateson, William |authorlink=William Bateson |year=1900 |title=Collective enquiry as to progressive melanism in moths—memorandum from the Evolution Committee of the Royal Society |journal=Entomological Record |volume=12 |page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1906, the geneticist [[Leonard Doncaster]] described the increase in frequency of the melanic forms of several moth species from about 1800 to 1850 in the [[Industrial Revolution|heavily industrialised]] north-west region of England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Doncaster, Leonard |authorlink=Leonard Doncaster |year=1906 |title=Collective enquiry as to progressive melanism in Lepidoptera |journal=Entomological Record |volume=18 |pages=165–168, 206–208, 222–276}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924, the evolutionary biologist [[J. B. S. Haldane]] constructed a [[mathematical model|mathematical argument]] showing that the rapid growth in frequency of the ''carbonaria''  form of the peppered moth, ''Biston betularia'', implied [[natural selection|selective pressure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Haldane |first=J. B. S. |authorlink=J. B. S. Haldane |title=A mathematical theory of natural and artificial selection--I. 1924 |journal=Bulletin of Mathematical Biology |year=1990 |volume=52 |issue=1–2 |pages=209–40; discussion 201–207 |pmid=2185859 |doi=10.1016/s0092-8240(05)80010-2}} Originally published in Trans Camb Phil Soc 23: 19–41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Haldane, J. B. S. |authorlink=J. B. S. Haldane |title=The Causes of Evolution |year=1932 |publisher=Longmans}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1955 onwards, the geneticist [[Bernard Kettlewell]] conducted [[Kettlewell's experiment|a series of experiments]] exploring the [[peppered moth evolution|evolution of melanism in the peppered moth]]. He used a [[capture-mark-recapture]] technique to show that dark forms survived better than light ones.&lt;ref name=Kettlewell1955&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kettlewell |first1=H. B.

By 1973, pollution in England had begun to decrease, and the dark ''carbonaria'' form had declined in frequency. This provided convincing evidence, gathered and analysed by Kettlewell and others such as the entomologist and geneticist [[Michael Majerus]] and the population geneticist Laurence M. Cook, that its rise and fall had been caused by natural selection in response to the changing pollution of the landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kettlewell, H. B.

==Taxonomic range==

Industrial melanism is known from over 70 species of [[moth]] that Kettlewell found in England, and many others from Europe and North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hendry |first1=Andrew P. |last2=Kinnison |first2=Michael T. |title=Microevolution Rate, Pattern, Process |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E031CAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA185 |year=2012 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-94-010-0585-2 |pages=185–}}, which cites Kettlewell 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;
Among these, ''[[Apamea crenata]]'' (clouded border brindle moth) and ''[[Acronicta rumicis]]'' (knot grass moth) are always polymorphic, though the melanic forms are more common in cities and (like those of the peppered moth) are declining in frequency as those cities become less polluted.&lt;ref name=CookTurner2008/&gt;

Among other insects, industrial melanism has been observed in a [[beetle]], ''[[Adalia bipunctata]]'', the two-spot ladybird.&lt;ref name="MuggletonLonsdale1975"/&gt;

In the vertebrates, industrial melanism is known from the turtle-headed seasnake ''[[Emydocephalus annulatus]]'',&lt;ref name=Goiran/&gt; and may be present in urban [[feral pigeon]]s.&lt;ref name="ChatelainGasparini2014"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chatelain |first1=M. |last2=Gasparini |first2=J. |last3=Jacquin |first3=L. |last4=Frantz |first4=A. |title=The adaptive function of melanin-based plumage coloration to trace metals |journal=Biology Letters |volume=10 |issue=3 |year=2014 |pages=20140164–20140164 |doi=10.1098/rsbl.2014.0164|pmc=3982444 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, peppered moths lived where light-colored [[lichen]]s covered the trees. For [[camouflage]] from predators against that clean background, they had generally light coloration.&lt;ref name=MuggletonLonsdale1975/&gt; During the [[Industrial Revolution]] in England, [[sulphur dioxide]] pollution in the atmosphere reduced the lichen cover, while [[soot]] blackened the bark of urban trees, making the light-colored moths more vulnerable to predation. This provided a selective advantage to the gene responsible for melanism, and the darker-colored moths increased in frequency.&lt;ref name="Grant1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grant|first1=Bruce S. |title=Fine Tuning the Peppered Moth Paradigm |journal=Evolution |volume=53 |issue=3 |year=1999 |pages=980–984 |doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.1999.tb05394.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=McIntyre, N.

[[File:Lichen-covered tree, Tresco.jpg|thumb|upright|Tree bark covered in shrubby and leafy [[lichen]]s forms a patterned background against which non-melanic [[disruptive coloration|disruptively patterned]] moth [[camouflage]] is effective.]]

Melanic ''B. betularia'' have been widely observed in North America. In 1959, 90% of ''B. betularia'' in Michigan and Pennsylvania were melanic. By 2001, melanism dropped to 6% of the population, following clean air legislation.&lt;ref name=Grant2002&gt;{{cite journal |author=Grant, B. S.; Wiseman L.

It has been suggested that the demonstrated relationship between melanism and pollution can not be fully proven because the exact reason for increase in survivability can not be tracked and pin-pointed. However, as air quality has improved in industrial areas of America and Britain, through improved [[regulation]], offering the conditions for a [[natural experiment]], melanism has sharply declined in moths including ''B. betularia'' and ''[[Odontopera bidentata]]''. Cook and J. R. G. Turner have concluded that "natural selection is the only credible explanation for the overall decline",&lt;ref name=CookTurner2008/&gt; and other biologists working in the area concur with this judgement.&lt;ref name=Grant1998&gt;{{cite journal |author=Grant, B.

===Immunity===

In 1921, the evolutionary biologist [[Richard Goldschmidt]] argued that the observed increase in the melanic form of the black arches moth, ''[[Lymantria monacha]]'', could not have been caused by [[mutation pressure]] alone, but required a selective advantage from an unknown cause: he did not consider camouflage as an explanation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Goldschmidt |first=R. |authorlink=Richard Goldschmidt |title=Controversial Geneticist and Creative Biologist: A Critical Review of His Contributions with an Introduction by Karl von Frisch |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D5L5BwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA75 |year=2013 |publisher=[[Birkhäuser]] |isbn=978-3-0348-5855-7 |page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly a century later, it was suggested that the moth's industrial melanism might, in addition ([[pleiotropy]]) to providing camouflage with "the well-known protective dark coloration",&lt;ref name=Mikkola2010/&gt; also confer better immunity to toxic chemicals from industrial pollution. The darker forms have a stronger [[immune response]] to foreign objects; these are encapsulated by [[haemocyte]]s (insect blood cells), and the capsule so formed is then hardened with deposits of the dark pigment, [[melanin]].&lt;ref name=Mikkola2010&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mikkola, K.; Rantala, M. J. |date=2010 |title=Immune defence, a possible nonvisual selective factor behind the industrial melanism of moths (Lepidoptera) |journal=Biological Journal of the Linnean Society |volume=99 |issue=4 |pages=831–838 |doi=10.1111/j.1095-8312.2010.01398.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gillespie andKanost1997"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gillespie |first1=Jeremy P. |last2=Kanost |first2=Michael R. |last3=Trenczek |first3=Tina |title=Biological Mediators of Insect Immunity |journal=Annual Review of Entomology |volume=42 |issue=1 |year=1997 |pages=611–643 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ento.42.1.611}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trace metal excretion===

A non-camouflage mechanism has been suggested for some vertebrates. In tropical ocean regions subject to industrial pollution the turtle-headed seasnake ''[[Emydocephalus annulatus]]'' is more likely to be melanic. These snakes shed their skin every two to six weeks. Sloughed skin contains toxic minerals, higher for dark skin, so industrial melanism could be selected for through improved excretion of trace elements.{{efn|The article does not address whether this is a genetic mutation or reversible adaptation by individuals.&lt;ref name=Goiran/&gt;}}&lt;ref name=Goiran&gt;{{cite journal |author=Goiran, C.; Bustamante, P.; Shine, R. |title=Industrial Melanism in the Seasnake Emydocephalus annulatus |journal=Current Biology |volume=27 |issue=16 |pages=2510–2513.e2 |year=2017 |pmid=28803870 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2017.06.073}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same may apply in the case of urban feral pigeons, which have the ability to remove trace metals such as zinc to their feathers. However, toxic lead was not found to accumulate in feathers, so the putative mechanism is limited in its range.&lt;ref name="ChatelainGasparini2014"/&gt;

===Thermal advantage===

}}

Melanic forms of the two-spot ladybird ''[[Adalia bipunctata]]'' are very frequent in and near cities, and rare in unpolluted countryside, so they appear to be industrial. Ladybirds are [[aposematic]] (with conspicuous warning coloration), so camouflage cannot explain the distribution. A proposed explanation is that the melanic forms have a thermal advantage directly linked to the pollution aspect of industrialization, since smoke and particulates in the air reduce the amount of sunlight that reaches the habitats of these species. Melanic phenotypes should then be favoured by natural selection, as the dark coloration absorbs the limited sunlight better.&lt;ref name="MuggletonLonsdale1975"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Muggleton |first1=John |last2=Lonsdale |first2=David |last3=Benham |first3=Brian R. |title=Melanism in ''Adalia bipunctata'' L. (Col., Coccinellidae) and its Relationship to Atmospheric Pollution |journal=The Journal of Applied Ecology |volume=12 |issue=2 |year=1975 |pages=451 |doi=10.2307/2402167}}&lt;/ref&gt; A possible explanation might be that in colder environments, the thermal advantages of industrial melanism might increase activity and the likelihood to mate. In the Netherlands, melanic ''A. bipunctata'' had a distinct mating advantage over the non-melanic form.&lt;ref name="De JongVerhoog1993"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=De Jong |first1=Peter W. |last2=Verhoog |first2=Michelle D. |last3=Brakefield |first3=Paul M. |title=Sperm competition and melanic polymorphism in the 2-spot ladybird, ''Adalia bipunctata'' (Coleoptera, Coccinellidae)  |journal=Heredity |volume=70 |issue=2 |year=1993 |pages=172–178 |doi=10.1038/hdy.1993.26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MuggletonLonsdale1975/&gt;

However, thermal melanism failed to explain the distribution of the species near [[Helsinki]] where the city forms a relatively warm 'heat island', while near the Finnish coast there is more sunlight as well as more melanism, so the selective pressure driving melanism requires a different explanation.&lt;ref name=Mikkola1988&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mikkola, K.; Albrecht, A. |year=1988 |title=The melanism of ''Adalia-bipunctata'' around the Gulf of Finland as an industrial phenomenon (Coleoptera, Coccinellidae) |journal=Annales Zoologici Fennici |volume=25 |pages=77-85 |jstor=23734522}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study in [[Birmingham]] similarly found no evidence of thermal melanism but a strong correlation with smoke pollution; melanism declined from 1960 to 1978 as the city became cleaner. Further, the same study found that a related species, ''[[Adalia decempunctata]]'', experienced no change in frequency of melanism in the same places in that period.&lt;ref name="BrakefieldLees1987"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brakefield |first1=Paul M. |last2=Lees |first2=David R. |title=Melanism in Adalia ladybirds and declining air pollution in Birmingham |journal=Heredity |volume=59 |issue=2 |year=1987 |pages=273–277 |doi=10.1038/hdy.1987.123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Das Jüngste Gericht (Memling).jpg|thumb|300px|right|''[[The Last Judgment (Memling)|The Last Judgment]]'' by painter [[Hans Memling]]. In Christian belief, the [[Last Judgement]] is an apocalyptic event where God makes a final judgement of all people on Earth.|alt=A three paneled colour painting. The centre panel shows Jesus sitting in judgment on the world, while St Michael is weighing souls. On the left hand panel, the saved are being guided into heaven, while on the right-hand panel, the damned are being dragged to hell]]

Predictions of [[apocalypse|apocalyptic events]] that would result in the [[Human extinction|extinction of humanity]], a [[Global catastrophic risk|collapse of civilization]], or the destruction of the planet have been made since at least the beginning of the [[Common Era]].&lt;ref name=zygon&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cole-Turner |first=Ronald |date=2012 |title=The singularity and the rapture: Transhumanist and popular Christian views of the future |journal=[[Zygon (journal)|Zygon]] |volume=47 |issue=4 |pages=777–796 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most predictions are related to [[Abrahamic religions]], often standing for or similar to the [[eschatological]] events described in their scriptures. Christian predictions typically refer to events like the [[Rapture]], [[Great Tribulation]], [[Last Judgment]], and the [[Second Coming of Christ]]. End-time events are usually predicted to occur within the lifetime of the person making the prediction, and are usually made using the Bible, and in particular the [[New Testament]], as either the primary or exclusive source for the predictions.&lt;ref name=zygon/&gt; Often this takes the form of mathematical calculations, such as trying to calculate the point where it will have been [[Year 6000|6000 years]] since the supposed creation of the Earth by the [[God in Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic God]],{{sfn|Aveni|2016|page=7}} which according to the [[Talmud]] marks the deadline for the [[Messiah]] to appear.&lt;ref name=six/&gt; Predictions of the end from [[natural disaster|natural events]] have also been theorised by various scientists and scientific groups. While these predictions are generally accepted as plausible within the scientific community, the events and phenomena are not expected to occur for hundreds of thousands or even billions of years from now.

Little research has been done into why people make apocalyptic predictions.&lt;ref name=few/&gt; Historically, it has been done for reasons such as diverting attention from actual crises like poverty and war, pushing political agendas, and promoting hatred of certain groups; [[antisemitism]] was a popular theme of Christian apocalyptic predictions in medieval times,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/people-have-always-been-obsessed-end-world-180956525/ |title=People Have Always Been Obsessed with the End of the World |last=Fessensden |first=Marissa |date=September 8, 2015 |work=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]] |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20180425054533/https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/people-have-always-been-obsessed-end-world-180956525/ |archivedate=April 25, 2018 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; while French and [[Lutheran]] depictions of the apocalypse were known to feature English and Catholic antagonists respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://theconversation.com/apocalypse-now-our-incessant-desire-to-picture-the-end-of-the-world-46104 |title=Apocalypse now: our incessant desire to picture the end of the world |last= |first= |date=August 25, 2015 |work=[[The Conversation (website)|The Conversation]] |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20180516234124/https://theconversation.com/apocalypse-now-our-incessant-desire-to-picture-the-end-of-the-world-46104 |archivedate=May 16, 2018 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to psychologists, possible explanations for why people believe in modern apocalyptic predictions include mentally reducing the actual danger in the world to a single and definable source, an innate human fascination with fear, personality traits of paranoia and powerlessness and a modern romanticism involved with end-times due to its portrayal in contemporary fiction.&lt;ref name=few&gt;{{cite web |url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/psychology-reveals-the-comforts-of-the-apocalypse/ |title=Psychology Reveals the Comforts of the Apocalypse |last=Yuhas |first=Daisy |date=December 18, 2012 |work=[[Scientific American]] |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20180425053659/https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/psychology-reveals-the-comforts-of-the-apocalypse/ |archivedate=April 25, 2018 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsweek.com/doomsday-postpone-again-heres-why-were-obsessed-end-world-according-psychology-670860 |title=Doomsday Is Postponed Again: Here's Why We’re All So Obsessed With The End Of World, According to Psychology |last=Dovey |first=Dana |date=September 26, 2017 |work=[[Newsweek]] |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20180425053733/http://www.newsweek.com/doomsday-postpone-again-heres-why-were-obsessed-end-world-according-psychology-670860 |archivedate=April 25, 2018 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prevalence of Abrahamic religions throughout modern history is said to have created a culture which encourages the embracement of a future that will be drastically different from the present.&lt;ref name=zygon/&gt;{{sfn|Aveni|2016|page=xii}} Such a culture is credited with the rise in popularity of predictions that are more secular in nature, such as the [[2012 phenomenon]], while maintaining the centuries-old theme that a powerful force will bring the end of humanity.{{sfn|Aveni|2016|page=xii}}

Polls conducted in 2012 across 20 countries found over 14% of people believe the world will end in their lifetime, with percentages ranging from 6% of people in France to 22% in the US and Turkey. Belief in the apocalypse is most prevalent in people with lower rates of education, lower household incomes, and those under the age of 35.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-05-02/news/ct-talk-end-of-the-world-poll-0502-20120502_1_mayan-calendar-new-poll-mayan-prophecy |title=Apocalypse now: Poll shows 1 in 7 thinks end of world is near |date=May 2, 2012 |work=[[The Chicago Tribune]] |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20180425025021/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-05-02/news/ct-talk-end-of-the-world-poll-0502-20120502_1_mayan-calendar-new-poll-mayan-prophecy |archivedate=April 25, 2018 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/one-seven-14-global-citizens-believe-end-world-coming-their-lifetime |title=One in Seven (14%) Global Citizens Believe End of the World is Coming in Their Lifetime |date=May 1, 2012 |work=[[Ipsos]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180425025212/https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/one-seven-14-global-citizens-believe-end-world-coming-their-lifetime |archivedate=April 25, 2018 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK in 2015, 23% of the general public believed the apocalypse was likely to occur in their lifetime, compared to 10% of experts from the [[Global Challenges Foundation]].

| Earth and the Moon will be most likely destroyed by falling into the Sun, just before the Sun reaches the largest of its [[red giant]] phase when it will be 256 times larger than it is now. Before the final collision, the Moon possibly spirals below Earth's [[Roche limit]], breaking into a ring of debris, most of which falls to Earth's surface.

[[File:Archangel Michael, St Pancras New Church, London.JPG|thumb|300px|Onyx sculpture in the grounds of [[St Pancras New Church]], London]] 
This is a geographical '''list of [[rock (geology)|natural stone]]''' used for decorative purposes in [[construction]] and [[monumental sculpture]] produced in various countries.

The [[dimension stone|dimension-stone]] industry classifies stone based on appearance and hardness as either "granite", "marble" or "slate".

The granite of the dimension-stone industry along with truly granitic rock also includes gneiss, gabbro, anorthosite and even some sedimentary rocks.

Natural stone is used as architectural stone (construction, flooring, cladding, counter tops, curbing, etc.) and as raw block and monument stone for the funerary trade. Natural stone is also used in custom stone engraving. The engraved stone can be either decorative or functional. Natural memorial stones are used as [[natural burial]] markers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9388">This is a list of [[butterfly]] species in diverse genera with the common name '''[[wikt:fritillary|fritillary]]'''. The term refers to the chequered markings on the wings, usually black on orange, and derives from the Latin ''fritillus'' (meaning dice-box - or, according to some sources, a chequerboard: the [[Fritillaria meleagris|fritillary flower]], with its chequered markings, has the same derivation).&lt;ref name=SOED&gt;{{cite book|title=Shorter Oxford English dictionary|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=United Kingdom|isbn=0199206872|pages=3804}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most fritillaries belong to the family [[Nymphalidae]].

[[Natural history]] specimen dealers had an important role in the development of science in the 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries. They supplied the rapidly growing, both in size and number, museums and educational establishments and private collectors whose collections, either in entirety or parts finally entered [[List of natural history museums|museums]].
Most sold not just [[Zoological specimen|zoological]], [[Botany|botanical]] and [[Geology|geological]] specimens but also 
equipment and books. Many also sold [[Archaeology|archaeological]] and [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] items.They purchased 
specimens from professional and amateur collectors, sometimes collected themselves as well as acting as agents for the sale of 
collections. Many were based in [[Mercantilism|mercantile]] centres notably [[Amsterdam]], [[Hamburg]], and [[London]] or

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2227">In [[chemistry]], '''metal vapor synthesis''' (MVS) is a method for preparing [[metal complex]]es by combining freshly produced metal atoms or small particles with [[ligand]]s.  In contrast to the high reactivity of such freshly produced metal atoms, bulk metals typically are unreactive toward neutral ligands.  The method has been used to prepare compounds that cannot be prepared by traditional synthetic methods, e.g. Ti(η&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-toluene)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  The technique relies on a reactor that evaporates the metal, allowing the vapor to impinge on a cold reactor wall that is coated with the organic ligand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.verdampfer-test.de/aspire-cleito/|title=Aspire Cleito Verdampfer Test|last=|first=|date=|access-date=2017-08-20|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The metal evaporates upon being [[resistive heating|heated resistively]] or irradiated with an [[electron beam]].  The apparatus operates under high vacuum.&lt;ref&gt;E. Schmidt, K. J. Klabunde, A. Ponce, A. Smetana, D. Heroux "Metal Vapor Synthesis of Transition Metal Compounds" Encyclopedia of Inorganic Chemistry 2006, John Wiley &amp; Sons. {{DOI|10.1002/0470862106.ia137}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a common implementation, the metal vapor and the organic ligand are co-condensed at liquid nitrogen temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;P. L. Timms "Transition metal vapors in chemical synthesis. The direct preparation of dibenzene chromium as an undergraduate experiment" J. Chem. Educ., 1972, volume 49, p 782. {{DOI| 10.1021/ed049p782}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In several case where compounds are prepared by MVS, related preparations employ conventional routes.  Thus, tris(butadiene)molybdenum was first prepared by co-condensation of butadiene and Mo vapor, but yields are higher for the reduction of [[molybdenum(V) chloride]] in the presence of the diene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Stephan, G.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5407">'''Meteorological intelligence''' is [[information]] measured, gathered, compiled, exploited, analyzed and disseminated by [[Meteorology|meteorologists]], [[Climatology|climatologists]] and [[Hydrology|hydrologists]] to characterize the current state and/or predict the future state of the [[atmosphere]] at a given location and time.  Meteorological intelligence is a subset of [[environmental intelligence]] and is synonymous with the term [[weather intelligence]].  

The earliest known use of the term "meteorological intelligence" in a written document dates to 1854 on pg. 168 of the Eighth Annual Report of the Board of Regents of the [[Smithsonian Institution]].  This report discusses the Smithsonian Institution's initiative to transmit meteorological intelligence via [[Telegraphy|telegraph]] lines.  An early reference to "meteorological intelligence" in England dates an 1866 issue of [[Edinburgh Review|The Edinburgh Review]] which was a prominent [[Scottish people|Scottish]] journal during the 19th century (Reeve 1866, pg. 75).  

Another documented, early use of the term dates to 1874 in a historical compilation entitled, "The American Historical Record" (Lossing 1874, pg. 125).  In this book, Lossing uses the term to refer to weather observations transmitted over telegraph lines for the purpose of studying the nature of [[storm]]s with the ultimate goal of enhancing public safety through the issuance of storm warnings.  This mission was carried out by the [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|Army Signal Service]] starting in the 1870s who was responsible for communication (via telegraph) of technical [[Intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] for the army as well as "meteorological intelligence" for the general welfare of the country (Ingersoll 1879, pg. 156).

From the viewpoint of the [[Intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence community]], the term meteorological intelligence is more limited in its use referring to the use of [[Clandestine operation|clandestine]] or technical means to learn about environmental conditions over enemy territory (Shulsky and Schmitt 2002) as in the [[North Atlantic weather war]]. In the [[military intelligence]] context, weather information is often referred to as meteorological or environmental intelligence (Hinsley 1990, pg. 420; Platt 1957, pg. 14; U.S. Congress, pg. 164). 

With regard to private sector [[meteorology]], the term meteorological intelligence is a broad term of art that is primarily associated with observed and forecast weather information provided to decision makers in one of a number of weather sensitive business areas including: Energy, [[forestry]], [[agriculture]], [[telecommunication]]s, [[transport]]ation, [[aviation]], [[entertainment]], [[Retailing|retail]] and [[construction]] (CMOS 2001, pg. 23) .  It is considered a key aspect of [[weather risk management]] for the legal and [[insurance]] industries.

The '''Mpemba effect''' is a process in which hot [[water]] can [[freezing|freeze]] faster than cold water. The phenomenon is temperature-dependent. There is disagreement about the parameters required to produce the effect and about its theoretical basis.&lt;ref name="Burridge"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/srep37665| pmid = 27883034| pmc = 5121640| title = Questioning the Mpemba effect: Hot water does not cool more quickly than cold| journal = Scientific Reports| volume = 6| pages = 37665| year = 2016| last1 = Burridge| first1 = Henry C.| last2 = Linden| first2 = Paul F.| bibcode = 2016NatSR...637665B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tao"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/acs.jctc.6b00735| pmid = 27996255| title = Different Ways of Hydrogen Bonding in Water - Why Does Warm Water Freeze Faster than Cold Water?| journal = Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation| volume = 13| issue = 1| pages = 55–76| year = 2017| last1 = Tao| first1 = Yunwen| last2 = Zou| first2 = Wenli| last3 = Jia| first3 = Junteng| last4 = Li| first4 = Wei| last5 = Cremer| first5 = Dieter}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Mpemba-two-water-probes.svg|thumb|440x440px]]

The Mpemba effect is named after [[Erasto B. Mpemba|Erasto Batholomeo Mpemba]] (b.1950) who discovered it in 1963. There were preceding [[ancient]] accounts of similar phenomena, but lacking sufficient detail to attempt verification.

== Definition ==
The phenomenon, when taken to mean "hot water freezes faster than cold", is difficult to reproduce or confirm because this statement is ill-defined.&lt;ref name="ball" /&gt; Monwhea Jeng proposes as a more precise wording:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There exists a set of initial parameters, and a pair of temperatures, such that given two bodies of water identical in these parameters, and differing only in initial uniform temperatures, the hot one will freeze sooner.&lt;ref name="Jeng"&gt;{{Cite journal
| title=Hot water can freeze faster than cold?!?
| journal=American Journal of Physics
| year=2006
| first=Monwhea
| last=Jeng
| volume=74
| issue=6
| pages=514–522

| doi=10.1119/1.2186331|bibcode = 2006AmJPh..74..514J }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, even with this definition it is not clear whether "freezing" refers to the point at which water forms a visible surface layer of ice; the point at which the entire volume of water becomes a solid block of ice; or when the water reaches {{convert|0|C}}.&lt;ref name="ball" /&gt; A quantity of water can be at {{convert|0|C}} and not be ice; after enough heat has been removed to reach {{convert|0|C}} more heat must be removed before the water changes to solid state (ice), so water can be liquid or solid at {{convert|0|C}}.

With the above definition there are simple ways in which the effect might be observed: For example, if the hotter temperature melts the frost on a cooling surface and thus increases the thermal conductivity between the cooling surface and the water container.&lt;ref name="ball" /&gt; On the other hand, there may be many circumstances in which the effect is not observed.&lt;ref name="ball" /&gt;

== Observations ==
[[File:Sky-31810071280.jpg|thumb|right|Mpemba effect experiment: the hot water contained in a thermos, if thrown into the air in a very cold environment, freezes instantly before touching the ground]]
[[File:Mpemba effect (30653381280).jpg|thumb|right|A pot of boiling water thrown into the winter air]]

=== Historical context ===
Various effects of heat on the freezing of water were described by ancient scientists such as [[Aristotle]]: "The fact that the water has previously been warmed contributes to its freezing quickly: for so it cools sooner. Hence many people, when they want to cool water quickly, begin by putting it in the sun. So the inhabitants of [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]] when they encamp on the ice to fish (they cut a hole in the ice and then fish) pour warm water round their reeds that it may freeze the quicker, for they use the ice like lead to fix the reeds."&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle]], [http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/meteorology.1.i.html Meteorology] I.12 348b31–349a4&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle's explanation involved ''[[antiperistasis]]'', "the supposed increase in the intensity of a quality as a result of being surrounded by its contrary quality."

[[Early modern]] scientists such as [[Francis Bacon]] noted that, "slightly tepid water freezes more easily than that which is utterly cold."&lt;ref&gt;[[Francis Bacon|Bacon, Francis]]; ''Novum Organum''de, [http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/bacon/bacon.liber2.shtml Lib. II], L&lt;/ref&gt; In the original [[Latin]], "aqua parum tepida facilius conglacietur quam omnino frigida."

[[René Descartes]] wrote in his ''[[Discourse on the Method]]'', "One can see by experience that water that has been kept on a fire for a long time freezes faster than other, the reason being that those of its particles that are least able to stop bending evaporate while the water is being heated."&lt;ref&gt;[[René Descartes|Descartes, René]]; [http://posner.library.cmu.edu/Posner/books/pages.cgi?call=423_D44D_1637&amp;layout=vol0/part0/copy0&amp;file=0247 Les Météores]&lt;/ref&gt; This relates to [[Descartes' vortex theory]].

The Scottish scientist [[Joseph Black]] investigated a special case of this phenomenon comparing previously-boiled with unboiled water;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Black |first1=Joseph |title=The Supposed Effect of Boiling upon Water, in Disposing It to Freeze More Readily, Ascertained by Experiments. By Joseph Black, M. D. Professor of Chemistry at Edinburgh, in a Letter to Sir John Pringle, Bart. P. R. S. |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London |date=1 January 1775 |volume=65 |pages=124–128 |doi=10.1098/rstl.1775.0014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the previously-boiled water froze more quickly. Evaporation was controlled for. He discussed the influence of stirring on the results of the experiment, noting that stirring the unboiled water led to it freezing at the same time as the previously-boiled water, and also noted that stirring the very-cold unboiled water led to immediate freezing. Joseph Black then discussed [[Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit|Fahrenheit's]] description of [[supercooling]] of water (although the term supercooling had not then been coined), arguing, in modern terms, that the previously-boiled water could not be as readily supercooled.

=== Mpemba's observation ===
The effect is named after [[Tanzania]]n [[Erasto B. Mpemba|Erasto Mpemba]]. He described it in 1963 in Form 3 of Magamba Secondary School, [[Tanganyika]], when freezing ice cream mix that was hot in cookery classes and noticing that it froze before the cold mix. He later became a student at Mkwawa Secondary (formerly High) School in [[Iringa]]. The headmaster invited [[Denis Osborne|Dr. Denis G. Osborne]] from the University College in [[Dar es Salaam]] to give a lecture on physics. After the lecture, [[Erasto B. Mpemba|Erasto Mpemba]] asked him the question, "If you take two similar containers with equal volumes of water, one at {{convert|35|C}} and the other at {{convert|100|C}}, and put them into a freezer, the one that started at {{convert|100|C}} freezes first. Why?", only to be ridiculed by his classmates and teacher. After initial consternation, Osborne experimented on the issue back at his workplace and confirmed Mpemba's finding. They published the results together in 1969, while Mpemba was studying at the [[College of African Wildlife Management]].&lt;ref name="Mpemba"&gt;{{Cite journal

Mpemba and Osborne describe placing {{convert|70|ml|abbr=on}} samples of water in {{convert|100|ml|abbr=on}} beakers in the ice box of a domestic refrigerator on a sheet of polystyrene foam. They showed the time for ''freezing to start'' was longest with an initial temperature of {{convert|25|C}} and that it was much less at around {{convert|90|C}}. They ruled out loss of liquid volume by evaporation as a significant factor and the effect of dissolved air. In their setup most heat loss was found to be from the liquid surface.&lt;ref name="Mpemba" /&gt;
 
David Auerbach describes an effect that he observed in samples in glass beakers placed into a liquid cooling bath. In all cases the water supercooled, reaching a temperature of typically {{convert|-6|to|-18|C}} before spontaneously freezing. Considerable random variation was observed in the time required for spontaneous freezing to start and in some cases this resulted in the water which started off hotter (partially) freezing first.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

James Brownridge, a radiation safety officer at the [[State University of New York]], has said that he believes that supercooling is involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Chown |first1=Marcus |title=Revealed: why hot water freezes faster than cold |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20527535.200-revealed-why-hot-water-freezes-faster-than-cold/ |work=New Scientist |date=24 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several [[molecular dynamics]] simulations have also supported that changes in hydrogen bonding during supercooling takes a major role in the process.&lt;ref name="Jin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sun"&gt;{{Cite journal

In 2016, Burridge and Linden defined the criterion as the time to reach {{convert|0|°C|°F}}, carried out experiments and reviewed published work to date. They noted that the large difference originally claimed had not been replicated, and that studies showing a small effect could be influenced by variations in the positioning of thermometers. They say, "We conclude, somewhat sadly, that there is no evidence to support meaningful observations of the Mpemba effect".&lt;ref name="Burridge" /&gt;

However, in 2017, two research groups independently and simultaneously found theoretical evidence of the Mpemba effect and also predicted a new "inverse" Mpemba effect in which heating a cooled, far-from-equilibrium system takes less time than another system that is initially closer to equilibrium. Lu and Raz&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Lu |first=Zhiyue |last2=Raz |first2=Oren |date=2017-05-16 |title=Nonequilibrium thermodynamics of the Markovian Mpemba effect and its inverse |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/114/20/5083 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |language=en |volume=114 |issue=20 |pages=5083–5088 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1701264114 |issn=0027-8424 |pmid=28461467 |arxiv=1609.05271 |bibcode=2017PNAS..114.5083L |pmc=5441807}}&lt;/ref&gt; yield a general criterion based on Markovian statistical mechanics, predicting the appearance of the inverse Mpemba effect in the [[Ising model]] and diffusion dynamics.

In this last work, it is suggested that a very generic mechanism leading to both Mpemba effects is due to a particle velocity [[Distribution function (physics)|distribution function]] that significantly deviates from the [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution|Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution]].

== Suggested explanations ==
The following explanations have been proposed:

* ''[[Evaporation]]'': The evaporation of the warmer water reduces the mass of the water to be frozen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

* ''[[Convection]]'': Accelerating [[heat transfer]]s. Reduction of water density below {{convert|4|°C|°F}} tends to suppress the convection currents that cool the lower part of the liquid mass; the lower density of hot water would reduce this effect, perhaps sustaining the more rapid initial cooling. Higher convection in the warmer water may also spread ice crystals around faster.&lt;ref&gt;[[CITV]] ''[[Prove It!]]'' [http://www.proveit.tv/series-1/fs.html?p=13&amp;s=3 Series 1 Programme 13]&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Frost]]'': Has [[Thermal insulation|insulating]] effects. The lower temperature water will tend to freeze from the top, reducing further heat loss by radiation and air convection, while the warmer water will tend to freeze from the bottom and sides because of water convection. This is disputed as there are experiments that account for this factor.&lt;ref name="Jeng" /&gt;
* ''[[Solution|Solutes]]'': The effects of [[calcium carbonate]], [[magnesium carbonate]] among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| arxiv=physics/0604224

| journal=American Journal of Physics

| bibcode=2009AmJPh..77...27K
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Thermal conductivity]]'': The container of hotter liquid may melt through a layer of frost that is acting as an insulator under the container (frost is an insulator, as mentioned above), allowing the container to come into direct contact with a much colder lower layer that the frost formed on (ice, refrigeration coils, etc.) The container now rests on a much colder surface (or one better at removing heat, such as refrigeration coils) than the originally colder water, and so cools far faster from this point on.
*''[[Dissolution (chemistry)|Dissolved gases]]'': Cold water can contain more dissolved gases than hot water, which may somehow change the properties of the water with respect to convection currents, a proposition that has some experimental support but no theoretical explanation.&lt;ref name="Jeng" /&gt;
* ''[[Hydrogen bonding]]'': In warm water, hydrogen bonding is weaker.&lt;ref name="Tao" /&gt;
* ''[[Crystallization]]'': Another explanation suggests that the relatively higher population of water hexamer states in warm water might be responsible for the faster crystallization.&lt;ref name="Jin"&gt;{{Cite journal

A reviewer for ''[[Physics World]]'' writes, "Even if the Mpemba effect is real &amp;mdash; if hot water can sometimes freeze more quickly than cold &amp;mdash; it is not clear whether the explanation would be trivial or illuminating." He pointed out that investigations of the phenomenon need to control a large number of initial parameters (including type and initial temperature of the water, dissolved gas and other impurities, and size, shape and material of the container, and temperature of the refrigerator) and need to settle on a particular method of establishing the time of freezing, all of which might affect the presence or absence of the Mpemba effect. The required vast multidimensional array of experiments might explain why the effect is not yet understood.&lt;ref name="ball"&gt;Ball, Philip (April 2006). [http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/print/2006/mar/29/does-hot-water-freeze-first Does hot water freeze first?]. ''Physics World'', pp. 19-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[New Scientist]]'' recommends starting the experiment with containers at {{convert|35|and|5|C}} to maximize the effect.&lt;ref&gt;''How to Fossilize Your Hamster: And Other Amazing Experiments for the Armchair Scientist'', {{ISBN|1-84668-044-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a related study, it was found that freezer temperature also affects the probability of observing the Mpemba phenomenon as well as container temperature.

In 2012, the [[Royal Society of Chemistry]] held a competition calling for papers offering explanations to the Mpemba effect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsc.org/mpemba-competition/ ''Mpemba Competition''], Royal Society of Chemistry, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; More than 22,000 people entered and [[Erasto B. Mpemba|Erasto Mpemba]] himself announced Nikola Bregović as the winner. Bregović suggests two reasons for the effect — a colder sample gets supercooled rather than frozen, and enhanced convection in the warmer sample speeds up cooling by maintaining the heat gradient on the container walls.&lt;ref&gt;Bregović, Nikola; [http://www.rsc.org/images/nikola-bregovic-entry_tcm18-225169.pdf ''Mpemba effect from a viewpoint of an experimental physical chemist''], 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Tao and co-workers proposed yet another possible explanation in 2016. On the basis of results from vibrational spectroscopy and modeling with [[density functional theory]]-optimized water clusters, they suggest that the reason might lie in the vast diversity and peculiar occurrence of different [[hydrogen bond]]s. Their key argument is that the number of strong hydrogen bonds increases as [[temperature]] is elevated.  The existence of the small strongly-bonded clusters facilitates in turn the [[nucleation]] of [[Ice Ih|hexagonal ice]] when warm water is rapidly cooled down.&lt;ref name="Tao" /&gt;

== Similar effects ==
Other phenomena in which large effects may be achieved faster than small effects are
* [[Latent heat]]: turning {{convert|0|C}} ice to {{convert|0|C}} water takes the same amount of energy as heating water from {{convert|0|C}} to {{convert|80|C}} 
* [[Leidenfrost effect]]: lower temperature boilers can sometimes vaporize water faster than higher temperature boilers

A '''natural landscape''' is the original landscape that exists before it is acted upon by human culture.&lt;ref group = note&gt;"The area prior to the introduction of man 's activity is represented by one body of morphologic facts. The forms that man has introduced are another set. We may call the former, with reference to man, the original, natural landscape. In its entirety it no longer exists in many parts of the world, but its reconstruction and understanding are the first part of formal morphonology." Carl O. Sauer, "The Morphology of Landscape". ''University of California Publications in Geography'', vol. 2, No. 2, 12 October 1925, p. 37.[https://archive.org/stream/universityofc02univ/universityofc02univ_djvu.txt]&lt;/ref&gt; The natural landscape and the [[cultural landscape]] are separate parts of the [[landscape]].&lt;ref group = note&gt;"The cultural landscape is fashioned from a natural landscape by a culture group. Culture is the agent, the natural area is the medium, the cultural landscape the result." Carl O. Sauer, "The Morphology of Landscape", p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the twenty-first century landscapes that are totally untouched by human activity no longer exist, so that reference is sometimes now made to degrees of naturalness within a landscape.&lt;ref group = note&gt;The [[European Environment Agency]]'s planned forest naturalness index is an example of an attempt to define one type of natural landscape in Europe. The Agency lists forests in three categories: (1) [[Plantations]]; (2) Semi-natural; and (3) Naturally dynamic. The latter are "forests whose structure, composition and function have been shaped by natural dynamics without substantial [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] influence over a long period of time".&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Silent Spring]]'' (1962) [[Rachel Carson]] describes a roadside verge as it used to look: "Along the roads, laurel, viburnum and alder, great ferns and wildflowers delighted the traveler’s eye through much of the year" and then how it looks now following the use of [[herbicide]]s: "The roadsides, once so attractive, were now lined with browned and withered vegetation as though swept by fire".&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge, Mass.: Riverside Press, 1962, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the landscape before it is sprayed is biologically degraded, and may well contains alien species, the concept of what might constitute a natural landscape can still be deduced from the context.

The phrase "natural landscape" was first used in connection with [[landscape painting]], and [[landscape gardening]], to contrast a formal style with a more natural one, closer to nature. [[Alexander von Humboldt]] (1769 – 1859) was to further conceptualize this into the idea of a natural landscape ''separate'' from the [[cultural landscape]]. Then in 1908 [[geographer]] [[Otto Schlüter]] developed the terms original landscape (''Urlandschaft'') and its opposite cultural landscape (''Kulturlandschaft'') in an attempt to give the science of geography a subject matter that was different from the other sciences. An early use of the actual phrase "natural landscape" by a [[geographer]] can be found in  [[Carl O. Sauer]]'s paper "The Morphology of Landscape" (1925).&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl O. Sauer]], "The Morphology of Landscape". ''University of California Publications in Geography'' 2 (2), pp. 19-53.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of the term==
The concept of a natural landscape was first developed in connection with [[landscape painting]], though the actual term itself was first used in relation to [[landscape gardening]]. In both cases it was used to contrast a formal style with a more natural one, that is closer to nature. Chunglin Kwa suggests, "that a seventeenth-century or early-eighteenth-century person could experience natural scenery ‘just like on a painting,’ and so, with or without the use of the word itself, designate it as a landscape."&lt;ref&gt;Chunglin Kwa, "Alexander von Humboldt's invention of the natural landscape", ''The European Legacy'', Vol. 10, No. 2, pp. 149-162, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to landscape gardening John Aikin, commented in 1794: "Whatever, therefore, there be of ''novelty'' in the singular scenery of an artificial garden, it is soon exhausted, whereas the infinite diversity of a natural landscape presents an inexhaustible flore of new forms".&lt;ref&gt;J. Aikin, M.D., ''Letters from a Father to His Son, on Various Topics, Relative to Literature and the Conduct of Life. Written in the Years 1792 and 1793'',  (Philadelphia:  Samuel Harrison Smith), p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in 1844 the prominent American landscape gardener [[Andrew Jackson Downing]] comments: "straight canals, round or oblong pieces of water, and all the regular forms of the geometric mode ... would evidently be in violent opposition to the whole character and expression of natural landscape".&lt;ref&gt;''A Treatise on the Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening Adapted to North America''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his extensive travels in South America, [[Alexander von Humboldt]] became the first to conceptualize a natural landscape separate from the cultural landscape, though he does not actually use these terms.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext05/qnct310.txt&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/cele/2005/00000010/00000002/art00002 Chunglin Kwa, Alexander von Humboldt's invention of the natural landscape, The European Legacy, Vol. 10, No. 2, pp. 149-162, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group = note&gt;[http://www.avhumboldt.net/humboldt/publications/paragraph/did/35/vid/38/cid/244/tid/7698/text/The-description-of-nature-in-its-manifold-richness-of-form-as-a-distinct-branch-of-poetic-literat] "The description of nature in its manifold richness of form, as a distinct branch of poetic literature, was wholly unknown to the Greeks. The landscape appears among them merely as the basil-ground of the picture of which human figures constitute the main subject. Passions, breaking forth into action, riveted their attention almost exclusively." Alexander von Humboldt ''[[Cosmos: a sketch of a physical description of the universe]]'' (translation 1804), Volume 2, Part I, Paragraph 5, Chapter I.&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Jackson Downing was aware of, and sympathetic to, Humboldt's ideas, which therefore influenced American landscape gardening.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Horticulturist'', vol.4, no.2, August 1849, which Downing edited.&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, the [[geographer]] [[Otto Schlüter]], in 1908, argued that by defining [[geography]] as a ''Landschaftskunde'' (landscape science) would give geography a logical subject matter shared by no other discipline.&lt;ref&gt;James, P.E &amp; Martin, G (1981) ''All Possible Worlds: A History of Geographical Ideas.'' John Wiley &amp; Sons. New York, p.177.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, T.H (1989) ''Human and Regional Geography in the German-speaking lands in the first forty years of the Twentieth Century''. Entriken, J. Nicholas &amp; Brunn, Stanley D (Eds) ''Reflections on Richard Hartshorne's The nature of geography''. Occasional publications of the Association of the American Geographers, Washington DC., p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; He defined two forms of landscape: the ''Urlandschaft'' (original landscape) or landscape that existed before major human induced changes and the ''Kulturlandschaft'' (cultural landscape) a landscape created by human culture. Schlüter argued that the major task of geography was to trace the changes in these two landscapes.

The term natural landscape is sometimes used as a synonym for [[wilderness]], but for geographers natural landscape is a scientific term which refers to the [[biological]], [[geological]], [[Climatology|climatological]] and other aspects of a landscape, not the cultural values that are implied by the word wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;"The Trouble with Wilderness; or, Getting Back to the Wrong Nature". William Cronon, ed., ''Uncommon Ground: Rethinking the Human Place in Nature''. (New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Co., 1995), pp. 69–90.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The natural and conservation===
Matters are complicated by the fact that the words nature and natural have more than one meaning. On the one hand there is the main dictionary meaning for nature: "The phenomena of the physical world collectively, including plants, animals, the landscape, and other features and products of the earth, as opposed to humans or human creations".&lt;ref&gt;"Nature", ''New Oxford American Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, there is the growing awareness, especially since [[Charles Darwin]], of humanities biological affinity with nature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://education.seattlepi.com/animals-share-human-dna-sequences-6693.html "Animals That Share Human DNA Sequences", Seattlepi.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] of the first definition has its roots is an "ancient concept", because early people viewed "nature, or the nonhuman world […] as a divine ''Other'', godlike in its separation from humans".&lt;ref&gt;Gregory H. Aplett and David N. Cole, "The Trouble with Naturalness: Rethinking Park and Wilderness Goals" in ''Beyond Naturalness: Rethinking Park and Wilderness Stewardshio in an Era of Rapid Change'' (Washington, DC.: Island Press, 2010), p. 14. They cite William Conron's 1995 essay "The Trouble with Wilderness: or, Getting Back to the Wrong Nature".&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Western culture|West]], Christianity's myth of [[The fall of man|the fall]], that is the expulsion of humankind from the [[Garden of Eden]], where all creation lived in harmony, into an imperfect world, has been the major influence.&lt;ref&gt;Joanne Vining, Melinda Merrick and Emily Price, "The Distinction between Humans and Nature". ''Human Ecology Review'', vol.15, no. 1, 2008, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cartesian dualism]], from the seventeenth century on,  further reinforced this dualistic thinking about nature.&lt;ref&gt;Vining, Merrick and Price, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; 
With this [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] goes value judgement as to [[appeal to nature|the superiority of the natural over the artificial]]. Modern science, however, is moving towards a [[holistic]] view of nature.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Kaika, ''City of Flows: Modernity, Nature, and the City''. (New York: Routledge, 2005), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

====America====
What is meant by natural, within the American [[conservation movement]], has been changing over the last century and a half.

In the mid-nineteenth century American began to realize that the land was becoming more and more domesticated and wildlife was disappearing. This led to the creation of [[National Park Service|American National Parks]] and other conservation sites.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory H. Aplett and David N. Cole, "The Trouble with Naturalness: Rethinking Park and Wilderness Goals" in ''Beyond Naturalness: Rethinking Park and Wilderness Stewardshio in an Era of Rapid Change'' (Washington, DC.: Island Press, 2010), pp. 14-15.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially it was believed that all that was needed to do was to separate what was seen as natural landscape and "avoid disturbances such as logging, grazing, fire and insect outbreaks".&lt;ref name="Aplett and Cole, p. 15"&gt;Aplett and Cole, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; This, and subsequent environmental policy, until recently, was influenced by ideas of the wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;William Cronon, pp. 72-77&lt;/ref&gt; However, this policy was not consistently applied, and in [[Yellowstone Park]], to take one example, the existing ecology was altered, firstly by the exclusion of Native Americans and later with the virtual extermination of the wolf population.&lt;ref name="dow"&gt;{{cite web |title=Defenders of Wildlife |work=A Yellowstone Chronology |url=http://www.defenders.org/wildlife/wolf/ynpchro.html |accessdate=2007-03-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607214843/http://www.defenders.org/wildlife/wolf/ynpchro.html |archivedate=7 June 2007}}&lt;/ref{{cite book |last=Merchant |first=Carolyn |title=The Columbia Guide to American Environmental History |publisher=Columbia University Press |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-231-11232-1 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=QQQximQsxSgC |page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A century later, in the mid-twentieth century, it began to be believed that the earlier policy of "protection from disturbance was inadequate to preserve park values", and that is that direct human intervention was necessary to restore the landscape of National Parks to its ‘’natural’’ condition.&lt;ref name="Aplett and Cole, p. 15"/&gt; In 1963 the [[Leopold Report]] argued that "A national park should represent a vignette of primitive America".&lt;ref&gt;Aplett and Cole, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; This policy change eventually led to the restoration of [[History of wolves in Yellowstone|wolves in Yellowstone Park]] in the 1990s.

However, recent research in various disciplines indicates that a pristine natural or "primitive" landscape is a myth, and it now realised that people have been changing the natural into a cultural landscape for a long while, and that there are few places untouched in some way from human influence.&lt;ref&gt;Aplett and Cole, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; The earlier conservation policies were now seen as cultural interventions. The idea of what is natural and what artificial or cultural, and how to maintain the natural elements in a landscape, has been further complicated by the discovery of [[global warming]] and how it is changing natural landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;Aplett and Cole, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

Also important is a reaction recently amongst scholars against dualistic thinking about nature and culture. Maria Kaika comments: "Nowadays, we are beginning to see nature and culture as intertwined once again – not [[ontologically]] separated anymore […].What I used to perceive as a compartmentalized world, consisting of neatly and tightly sealed, autonomous ‘space envelopes’ (the home, the city, and nature) was, in fact, a messy socio-spatial continuum”.&lt;ref&gt;''City of Flows: Modernity, Nature, and the City''. (New York: Routledge, 2005), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; And William Cronon argues against the idea of wilderness because it "involves a dualistic vision in which the human is entirely outside the natural"&lt;ref&gt;Cronon, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; and affirms that "wildness (as opposed to wilderness) can be found anywhere" even "in the cracks of a Manhattan sidewalk".&lt;ref name="Cronon, p. 85"&gt;Cronon, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cronon we have to "abandon the dualism that sees the tree in the garden as artificial […] and the tree in the wilderness as natural […] Both in some ultimate sense are wild."&lt;ref name="Cronon, p. 85"/&gt; Here he bends somewhat the regular dictionary meaning of wild, to emphasise that nothing natural, even in a garden, is fully under human control.

====Europe====
The landscape of Europe has considerably altered by people and even in an area, like the [[Cairngorm Mountains]] of [[Scotland]], with a low population density, only " the high summits of the [[Cairngorm Mountains]], consist entirely of natural elements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snh.gov.uk/about-scotlands-nature/scotlands-landscapes/what-is-landscape/  [[Scottish Natural Heritage]], ]&lt;/ref&gt; These ''high summits'' are of course only part of the Cairngorms, and there are no longer wolves, bears, wild boar or lynx in Scotland's wilderness.&lt;ref&gt;Murray (1973)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/north_east/6155172.stm | title = Extinct Island Pig Spotted Again | publisher = BBC News | date = 17 November 2006 | accessdate =1 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fraser Darling and Boyd 1969 64"&gt;Fraser Darling and Boyd (1969) p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Scots pine]] in the form of the [[Caledonian forest]] also covered much more of the Scottish landscape than today.&lt;ref&gt;Steven, H. M. &amp; Carlisle, A. (1959). ''The Native Pinewoods of Scotland''. Oliver and Boyd, Edinburgh&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Swiss National Park]], however, represent a more natural landscape. It was founded in 1914, and is one of the earliest national parks in Europe.
Visitors are not allowed to leave the motor road, or paths through the park, make fire or camp. The only building within the park is Chamanna Cluozza, [[mountain hut]]. It is also forbidden to disturb the animals or the plants, or to take home anything found in the park. Dogs are not allowed. Due to these strict rules, the Swiss National Park is the only park in the Alps who has been categorized by the [[IUCN]] as a [[strict nature reserve]], which is the highest protection level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/mabdb/br/brdir/directory/biores.asp?code=SWI+01&amp;mode=all Parc Suisse Biosphere Reserve]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of natural landscape==
No place on the Earth is unaffected by people and their culture. People are part of [[biodiversity]], but human activity affects biodiversity, and this alters the natural landscape.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnh.org/museum/press/feature/biofact.html National Survey Reveals Biodiversity Crisis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607101209/http://www.amnh.org/museum/press/feature/biofact.html |date=7 June 2007 }} American Museum of Natural History&lt;/ref&gt; Mankind have altered landscape to such an extent that few places on earth remain pristine, but once free of human influences, the landscape can return to a natural or near natural state.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4uDb0H4V5c YouTube, Professor James Lovelock, We can't save the planet, BBC NEWS, 2010/03/30]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wrangell St. Elias National Park.jpg|thumb| [[Glacier]] on the border between [[Alaska]], US, and Canada: [[Kluane-Wrangell-St. Elias-Glacier Bay-Tatshenshini-Alsek]] park system]]
Even the remote [[Yukon]] and [[Alaskan]] wilderness, the bi-national [[Kluane-Wrangell-St. Elias-Glacier Bay-Tatshenshini-Alsek]] park system comprising [[Kluane National Park|Kluane]], [[Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve|Wrangell-St Elias]], [[Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve|Glacier Bay]] and [[Tatshenshini-Alsek Park|Tatshenshini-Alsek]] parks, a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]], is not free from human influence, because the [[Kluane National Park]] lies within the traditional territories of the Champagne and Aishihik [[First Nations]] and [[Kluane First Nation]] who have a long history of living in this region. Through their respective Final Agreements with the Canadian Government, they have made into law their rights to harvest in this region.

==Examples of cultural forces==
Cultural forces intentionally or unintentionally, have an influence upon the landscape.&lt;ref group = note&gt;[http://lamar.colostate.edu/%7Ehrolston/Technol-vs-Nature-Aberdeen.pdf "It is true that certain human technological actions do have unintended consequences that spread everywhere; there are contagious effects that seep into the nooks and crannies of all nature." Holmes Rolston III, "Technology versus nature, What is natural, Journal of Philosophy and Technology", ''Ends and Means'', Vol 2 No.2 Spring 1998, University of Aberdeen, Edinburgh University Press]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cultural landscapes]] are places or artifacts created and maintained by people. Examples of cultural intrusions into a landscape are: fences, roads, parking lots, sand pits, buildings, hiking trails, management of plants, including the introduction of [[invasive species]], extraction or removal of plants, management of animals, mining, hunting, [[natural landscaping]], farming and forestry, pollution. Areas that might be confused with a natural landscape include [[public park]]s, farms, orchards, artificial lakes and reservoirs, managed forests, golf courses, nature center trails, gardens.

A '''natural monument''' is a natural or natural/cultural feature of outstanding or unique value because of its inherent rarity, representative of aesthetic qualities or cultural significance. 

Under [[World Commission on Protected Areas]] guidelines, natural monuments are level III, described as:
:"Areas are set aside to protect a specific natural monument, which can be a landform, sea mount, submarine cavern, geological feature such as a cave or even a living feature such as an ancient grove. They are generally quite small protected areas and often have high visitor value."
This is a lower level of protection than level II (national parks) and level I (wilderness areas).

The European Environment Agency's guidelines for selection of a natural monument are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://glossary.eea.europa.eu/EEAGlossary/N/natural_monument|title=Environmental Terminology Discovery Service — EEA|publisher=glossary.eea.europa.eu|access-date=2006-06-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060718151533/http://glossary.eea.europa.eu/EEAGlossary/N/natural_monument|archive-date=2006-07-18|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The area should contain one or more features of outstanding significance. Appropriate natural features include waterfalls, caves, [[impact crater|crater]]s, fossil beds, sand dunes and marine features, along with unique or representative [[fauna]] and [[flora]]; associated cultural features might include cave dwellings, cliff-top forts, archaeological sites, or natural sites which have heritage significance to indigenous peoples.
* The area should be large enough to protect the integrity of the feature and its immediately related surroundings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9251">[[File:Romuvan ritual fire.png|thumb|An ''aukuras'', a type of fire altar found in [[Romuva (religion)|Romuva]], a modern Pagan faith characterised as a "nature religion".]]

A '''nature religion''' is a religious movement that believes [[nature]] and the [[Natural environment|natural world]] is an embodiment of divinity, sacredness or spiritual power.&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 11"/&gt; Nature religions include [[indigenous religion]]s [[Nature worship|practiced]] in various parts of the world by cultures who consider the environment to be imbued with spirits and other sacred entities. It also includes [[modern Paganism|contemporary Pagan]] faiths which are primarily concentrated in Europe and North America.

The term "nature religion" was first coined by the American [[religious studies]] scholar [[Catherine Albanese]], who used it in her work ''Nature Religion in America: From the Algonkian Indians to the New Age'' (1991) and later went on to use it in other studies. Following on from Albanese's development of the term it has since been used by other academics working in the discipline.

==Definition==
Catherine Albanese described nature religion as "a symbolic center and the cluster of beliefs, behaviours, and values that encircles it", deeming it to be useful for shining a light on aspects of history that are rarely viewed as religious.{{sfn|Albanese|1991|pp=7&amp;ndash;8}}
In a paper of his on the subject, the Canadian religious studies scholar Peter Beyer described "nature religion" as a "useful analytical abstraction" to refer to "any religious belief or practice in which devotees consider nature to be the embodiment of divinity, sacredness, transcendence, spiritual power, or whatever cognate term one wishes to use".&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 11"&gt;[[#Bey98|Beyer 1998]]. p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to note that in this way nature religion was not an "identifiable religious tradition" such as [[Buddhism]] or [[Christianity]] are, but that it instead covers "a range of religious and quasi-religious movements, groups and social networks whose participants may or may not identify with one of the many constructed religions of global society which referred to many other nature religion."&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 16"&gt;[[#Bey98|Beyer 1998]]. p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Amatciems July 2015.jpg|thumb|left|Amatciems, a settlement of [[Ringing Cedars' Anastasians]] in [[Drabeši Parish]], [[Latvia]]. Anastasianism is a Russian-originated modern Pagan movement that sacralises environmental and human nativity (''[[Rod (Slavic religion)|Rod]]''), and is therefore regarded as a "nature religion".]]

===Common characteristics===
Peter Beyer noted the existence of a series of common characteristics which he believed were shared by different nature religions. He remarked that although "one must be careful not to overgeneralise", he suspected that there were a series of features which "occur sufficiently often" in those nature religions known to recorded scholarship to constitute a pattern.&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 17"/&gt;

The first of these common characteristics was nature religion's "comparative resistance to institutionalisation and legitimisation in terms of identifiable socio-religious authorities and organisations", meaning that nature religionists rarely formed their religious beliefs into large, visible socio-political structures such as churches. Furthermore, Beyer noted, nature religionists often held a "concomitant distrust of and even eschewing of politically orientated power".&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 17"/&gt; Instead of this, he felt that among nature religious communities, there was "a valuing of community as non-hierarchical" and a "conditional optimism with regard to human capacity and the future."&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 17"/&gt;

In the sphere of the environment, Beyer noted that nature religionists held to a "holistic conception of reality" and "a valorisation of physical place as vital aspects of their spiritualities".&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 17"/&gt; Similarly, Beyer noted the [[individualism]] which was favoured by nature religionists. He remarked that those adhering to such beliefs typically had respect for "charismatic and hence purely individual authority" and place a "strong emphasis on individual paths" which led them to believe in "the equal value of individuals and groups". Along similar lines, he also commented on the "strong experiential basis" to nature religionist beliefs "where personal experience is a final arbiter of truth or validity".&lt;ref name="Beyer 1998 17"/&gt;

==Use within academia==
In April 1996, the [[University of Lancaster]] in North West England held a conference on contemporary Paganism entitled "Nature Religion Today: Western Paganism, Shamanism and Esotericism in the 1990s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Samuel|first=Geoffrey|date=1996-10-01|title=Nature Religion Today: Western Paganism, Shamanism and Esotericism in the 1990s. Conference at the Lake District Campus of Lancaster University, 9th to 13th April 1996|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1006/reli.1996.0031|journal=Religion|volume=26|issue=4|pages=373–376|doi=10.1006/reli.1996.0031|issn=0048-721X}}&lt;/ref&gt;", and ultimately led to the publication of an academic anthology of the same name two years later.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pea98|Pearson, Roberts and Samuel 1998]]. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clifton 2004 8"&gt;[[#Clif04|Clifton 2004]]. p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; This book, ''Nature Religion Today: Paganism in the Modern World'', was edited by members of the University's Department of Religious Studies, a postgraduate named Joanne Pearson and two professors, Richard H. Roberts and Geoffrey Samuel.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pea98|Pearson, Roberts and Samuel 1998]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In his study of [[Wicca]], the [[Pagan studies]] scholar Ethan Doyle White expressed the view that the category of "nature religion" was problematic from a "historical perspective" because it solely emphasises the "commonalities of belief and attitude to the natural world" that are found between different religions and in doing so divorces these different belief systems from their distinctive socio-cultural and historical backgrounds.{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=8}}

He is regarded as one of the founders of modern [[ethology]], the study of animal behavior.

In 1951, he published ''The Study of Instinct'', an influential book on animal behaviour.
In the 1960s, he collaborated with filmmaker [[Hugh Falkus]] on a series of wildlife films, including ''The Riddle of the [[Rook (bird)|Rook]]'' (1972) and ''Signals for Survival'' (1969), which won the Italia prize in that year and the American blue ribbon in 1971.

== Education and early life ==
Born in [[The Hague]], Netherlands, he was one of five children of Dirk Cornelis Tinbergen and his wife Jeannette van Eek. His brother, [[Jan Tinbergen]], won the first [[Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel]] in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/1969/press.html | title=The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 1969 | publisher=Nobelprize.org | year=1969 | accessdate=27 January 2014 | author=Lundberg, Erik}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are the only siblings to each win a Nobel Prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/facts/|title=Nobel Prize Facts|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another brother, [[Luuk Tinbergen]] was also a noted biologist.

Tinbergen's interest in nature manifested itself when he was young. He studied [[biology]] at [[Leiden University]] and was a prisoner of war during [[World War II]]. Tinbergen's experience as a prisoner of the Nazis led to some friction with longtime intellectual collaborator [[Konrad Lorenz]], and it was several years before the two reconciled.&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia.com"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Nikolaas_Tinbergen.aspx | title=Encyclopedia.com Nikolaas Tinbergen | publisher=Encyclopedia.com | accessdate=16 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, Tinbergen moved to England, where he taught at the [[University of Oxford]] and was a fellow first at [[Merton College, Oxford]] and later at [[Wolfson College, Oxford]].&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia.com"/&gt; Several of his graduate students went on to become prominent biologists including [[Richard Dawkins]],&lt;ref name=dawkinsphd/&gt; [[Marian Dawkins]],&lt;ref name=stamphd/&gt; [[Desmond Morris]],&lt;ref name=Beale/&gt; [[Iain Douglas-Hamilton]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Daston|first1=Lorraine|last2=Mitman|first2=Gregg|title=Thinking with Animals: New Perspectives on Anthropomorphism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CaX_7w_gZwsC&amp;pg=PT193|year=2005|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-50377-8|page=193}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tony Sinclair (biologist)|Tony Sinclair]].&lt;ref name=serengeti&gt;{{cite book |last=Sinclair |first=Anthony |date=2012 |title=Serengeti Story: Life and Science in the World's Greatest Wildlife Region |url= |location= |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=33 |isbn=9780199645527 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research and career==

=== The Study of Instinct ===
[[File:Tinbergen good figure wiki2.jpg|thumb|350px|Figure 1. Tinbergen's hierarchical model. Modified from ''The Study of Instinct'' (1951).]]

In 1951 Tinbergen's ''The Study of Instinct'' was published. Behavioural ecologists and evolutionary biologists still recognise the contribution this book offered the field of [[behavioural science]] studies. ''The Study of Instinct'' summarises Tinbergen's ideas on innate behavioural reactions in animals and the adaptiveness and evolutionary aspects of these behaviours. By behaviour, he means the total movements made by the intact animal; innate behaviour is that which is not changed by the learning process. The major question of the book is the role of internal and external stimuli in controlling the expression of behaviour.&lt;ref name="Hinde, R. A. 1956"&gt;Hinde, R. A. ''Ethological Models and the Concept of 'Drive'''. British Journal of the Philosophy of Science, 6, 321–331 (1956)&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular, he was interested in explaining 'spontaneous' behaviours: those that occurred in their complete form the first time they were performed and that seemed resistant to the effects of learning.  He explains how behaviour can be considered a combination of these spontaneous behaviour patterns and as set series of reactions to particular stimuli. Behaviour is a reaction in that to a certain extent it is reliant on external stimuli, however it is also spontaneous since it is also dependent upon internal causal factors.&lt;ref name="Hinde, R. A. 1956"/&gt;

His model for how certain behavioural reactions are provoked was based on work by [[Konrad Lorenz]]. Lorenz postulated that for each instinctive act there is a specific energy which builds up in a reservoir in the brain.  In this model, Lorenz envisioned a reservoir with a spring valve at its base that an appropriate [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimulus]] could act on, much like a weight on a scale pan pulling against a spring and releasing the reservoir of energy, an action which would lead an animal to express the desired behaviour.&lt;ref name="Hinde, R. A. 1956"/&gt;

Tinbergen added complexity to this model, a model now known as Tinbergen's hierarchical model. He suggested that motivational impulses build up in nervous centres in the brain which are held in check by blocks. The blocks are removed by an innate releasing mechanism that allows the energy to flow to the next centre (each centre containing a block that needs to be removed) in a cascade until the behaviour is expressed. Tinbergen's model shows multiple levels of complexity and that related behaviours are grouped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Tinbergen, Nikolaas | year=1951 | title=The Study of Instinct | publisher=Oxford University Press | pages=nnn–mmm}}{{page needed|date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example is in his experiments with foraging [[honey bees]]. He showed that honey bees show curiosity for yellow and blue paper models of flowers, and suggested that these were visual stimuli causing the buildup of energy in one specific centre. However, the bees rarely landed on the model flowers unless the proper odour was also applied. In this case, the chemical stimuli of the odour allowed the next link in the chain to be released, encouraging the bee to land. The final step was for the bee to insert its mouthparts into the flower and initiate suckling. Tinbergen envisioned this as concluding the reaction set for honey bee feeding behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Tinbergen, Nikolaas | year=1951 | title=The Study of Instinct | publisher=Oxford University Press | pages=nnn–mmm}}{{page needed|date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nobel Prize ===
In 1973 Tinbergen, along with [[Konrad Lorenz]] and [[Karl von Frisch]], were awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] "for their discoveries concerning organization and elicitation of individual and social behaviour patterns".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1973/&lt;/ref&gt; The award recognised their studies on genetically programmed behaviour patterns, their origins, maturation and their elicitation by key stimuli. In his Nobel Lecture, Tinbergen addressed the somewhat unconventional decision of the Nobel Foundation to award the prize for Physiology or Medicine to three men who had until recently been regarded as "mere animal watchers". Tinbergen stated that their revival of the "watching and wondering" approach to studying behaviour could indeed contribute to the relief of human suffering.&lt;ref&gt;Tinbergen, N. Ethology and stress diseases. Physiology Or Medicine: 1971–1980 19711980, 113 (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

The studies performed by the trio on fish, insects and birds laid the foundation for further studies on the importance of specific experiences during critical periods of normal development, as well as the effects of abnormal psychosocial situations in mammals. At the time, these discoveries were stated to have caused "a breakthrough in the understanding of the mechanisms behind various symptoms of psychiatric disease, such as anguish, compulsive obsession, stereotypic behaviour and catatonic posture".&lt;ref&gt;Zetterström, R. The Nobel Prize for the introduction of ethology, or animal behaviour, as a new research field: possible implications for child development and behaviour: Nobel prizes of importance to Paediatrics. Acta Paediatrica 96, 1105–1108 (2007).

&lt;/ref&gt; Tinbergen’s contribution to these studies included the testing of the hypotheses of Lorenz/von Frisch by means of "comprehensive, careful, and ingenious experiments"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1973/presentation-speech.html |date=1973  |first=Börje |last=Cronholm |title=Award Ceremony Speech |publisher=Nobelprize.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as his work on supernormal stimuli. The work of Tinbergen during this time was also regarded as having possible implications for further research in child development and behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Zetterström, R. The Nobel Prize for the introduction of ethology, or animal behaviour, as a new research field: possible implications for child development and behaviour: Nobel prizes of importance to Paediatrics. Acta Paediatrica 96, 1105–1108 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

He also caused some intrigue by dedicating a large part of his acceptance speech to [[F. Matthias Alexander|FM Alexander]], originator of the [[Alexander technique]], a method which investigates postural reflexes and responses in human beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1973/tinbergen-lecture.pdf|title = Nikolaas Tinbergen Nobel Lecture Ethology and Stress Diseases|date = 12 December 1973|access-date = |publisher = NobelPrize.org|last = Tinbergen|first = Nikolaas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other awards and honours===
In 1950 Tinbergen became member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&amp;aId=PE00003350 |title=Niko Tinbergen (1907–1988) |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |accessdate=19 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected a [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1962|Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1962]].&lt;ref name="frs"/&gt; He was also awarded the Godman-Salvin Medal in 1969 by the British Ornithologists' Union,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bou.org.uk/about-the-bou/administration-and-people/medals-and-awards/|title=Medals and awards "  British Ornithologists' Union|publisher=bou.org.uk|access-date=27 July 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170331172205/https://www.bou.org.uk/about-the-bou/administration-and-people/medals-and-awards/|archivedate=31 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1973 received the Swammderdam Medal&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gngh.uva.nl/onderscheidingen/swammerdam-medaille/swammerdam-medaille.html|title=Swammerdam medaille – GNGH – Universiteit van Amsterdam|last=Amsterdam|first=Universiteit van|website=gngh.uva.nl|access-date=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Wilhelm Bölsche Medal&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Life of David Lack: Father of Evolutionary Ecology|last=Anderson|first=Ted|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|isbn=0199922659|location=Oxford|pages=185|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; (from the Genootschap ter bervordering van Natuur-, Genees- en Heelkunde of the University of Amsterdam and the Kosmos-Gesellschaft der Naturfreunde respectively).

=== Approach to animal behaviour ===
{{main article|Tinbergen's four questions}}

Tinbergen described four questions he believed should be asked of any animal behaviour,&lt;ref&gt;Diagram on [http://www-personal.umich.edu/~nesse/Nesse-Tinbergen4Q.PDF The Four Areas of Biology]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Further Diagrams on [http://homepage.uibk.ac.at/~c720126/humanethologie/ws/medicus/block1/inhalt.html The Four Areas of Biology (Documents No. 5, 6 and 7 in English)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lorenz | first1 = K. | doi = 10.1111/j.1439-0310.1937.tb01401.x | title = Biologische Fragestellung in der Tierpsychologie | journal = Zeitschrift für Tierpsychologie | volume = 1 | pages = 24–32 | year = 1937}} (in English: Biological Questions in Animal Psychology).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Tinbergen | first1 = N. | authorlink = Nikolaas Tinbergen| title = On aims and methods of Ethology | doi = 10.1111/j.1439-0310.1963.tb01161.x | journal = Zeitschrift für Tierpsychologie | volume = 20 | issue = 4 | pages = 410–433 | year = 1963}}&lt;/ref&gt; which were:

# [[Causality|Causation]] (mechanism): what are the stimuli that elicit the response, and how has it been modified by recent [[learning]]? How do behaviour and psyche "function" on the molecular, physiological, neuro-ethological, cognitive and social level, and what do the relations between the levels look like? (compare: [[Nicolai Hartmann]]: "The laws about the levels of complexity")
# [[Developmental biology|Development]] ([[ontogeny]]): how does the behaviour change with age, and what early experiences are necessary for the behaviour to be shown? Which developmental steps (the ontogenesis follows an "inner plan") ''and'' which environmental factors play when / which role? (compare: [[Recapitulation theory]])
# Function ([[adaptation]]): how does the [[behaviour]] impact on the animal's chances of survival and reproduction?
# [[Evolution]] ([[phylogeny]]): how does the behaviour compare with similar behaviour in related [[species]], and how might it have arisen through the process of phylogeny? Why did structural associations (behaviour can be seen as a "time space structure") evolve in this manner and not otherwise?*

In [[ethology]] and [[sociobiology]], causation and ontogeny are summarised as the "proximate mechanisms", while [[adaptation (biology)|adaptation]] and [[phylogeny]] are the "ultimate mechanisms". They are still considered as the cornerstone of modern ethology, sociobiology and [[transdisciplinarity]] in Human Sciences.

=== Supernormal stimulus ===
A major body of Tinbergen's research focused on what he termed the [[supernormal stimulus]]. This was the concept that one could build an artificial object which was a stronger stimulus or releaser for an instinct than the object for which the instinct originally evolved.  He constructed plaster eggs to see which a bird preferred to sit on, finding that they would select those that were larger, had more defined markings, or more saturated colour—and a dayglo-bright one with black polka dots would be selected over the bird's own pale, dappled eggs.

Tinbergen found that territorial male [[three-spined stickleback]] (a small freshwater fish) would attack a wooden fish model more vigorously than a real male if its underside was redder. He constructed cardboard dummy butterflies with more defined markings that male butterflies would try to mate with in preference to real females. The superstimulus, by its exaggerations, clearly delineated what characteristics were eliciting the instinctual response.

Among the modern works calling attention to Tinbergen's classic work is [[Deirdre Barrett]]'s 2010 book, ''[[Supernormal Stimuli]]''.

=== Autism ===
Tinbergen applied his observational methods to the problems of [[autism spectrum|autistic]] children. He recommended a "[[Attachment therapy|holding therapy]]" in which parents hold their autistic children for long periods of time while attempting to establish eye contact, even when a child resists the embrace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Tinbergen N, Tinbergen EA |title= Autistic Children: New Hope for a Cure |publisher= [[Routledge]] |year=1986 |edition= new |isbn=0-04-157011-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, his interpretations of autistic behaviour, and the holding therapy that he recommended, lacked scientific support&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bishop | first1 = D.

== Personal life ==
Tinbergen was a member of the advisory committee to the [[Anti-Concorde Project]]{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} and was also an atheist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Supernormal Stimuli: How Primal Urges Overran Their Evolutionary Purpose|year=2010|publisher=W.

Wartime atrocities, however, had highlighted the absence of a deity for him while both sides invoked one aligned with themselves, and this turned him into a militant atheist.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tinbergen married Elisabeth Rutten and they had five children. Later in life he suffered [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] and feared he might, like his brother Luuk, commit suicide. He was treated by his friend, whose ideas he had greatly influenced, [[John Bowlby]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Van Der Horst | first1 = F. C.

The '''Orapa Power Station''' is a [[Peaking power plant|Peak load power generation plant]] located in the mining town of [[Orapa]] in northeastern [[Botswana]] in the [[Central District (Botswana)|Central District]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mmegi.bw/index.php?sid=4&amp;aid=587&amp;dir=2011/October/Monday10/|title=Mmegi Online :: Orapa power plant to be finally launched|work=Mmegi Online|access-date=2018-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is built within the [[Debswana|Debswana Diamond Company Ltd]] [[Orapa diamond mine]] [[lease|fenced leased area]] and is operated by the [[Botswana Power Corporation]].


==Background==
The plant construction was initiated when [[Botswana]] started experiencing electricity supply challenges from year '''2007''' when demand for electricity in the [[country]] started exceeding the county's electricity generation capacity leading to forced periodic nation wide [[Rolling_blackout|load shedding]] excises by the [[Botswana Power Corporation]]. The plant was a short term response to the mining industry electricity requirements&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mmegi.bw/index.php?sid=4&amp;aid=5796&amp;dir=2010/October/Friday22 Developers of Orapa's 90MW push for 60 % cost reduction]&lt;/ref&gt; prior to the development of Mmamabula and Morupule B power stations.

The plant site is located next to an [[electrical substation]] through which it connects to the [[Electrical grid|national grid]] and was designed to use either [[natural gas]] or [[Diesel_fuel|diesel]] as [[fuel]]. It was commissioned using [[Diesel_fuel|diesel]] with a planned conversion to [[natural gas]] once construction of a [[Pipeline transport|gas pipeline]] from nearby [[Coalbed methane|gas fields]] was complete and commissioned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sundaystandard.info/kalahari-energy-convert-diesel-orapa-power-plant-cbm-operation Kalahari Energy to convert diesel Orapa Power Plant to CBM operation]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specifications==
The plant consists of two 45MW [[GE LM6000]] Sprint [[Simple_cycle_combustion_turbine|Simple Cycle]] [[gas turbines]] fueled using [[Diesel_fuel|diesel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sundaystandard.info/bpc-gets-orapa-90mw-power-station|title=BPC gets Orapa 90MW Power Station {{!}} Sunday Standard|website=www.sundaystandard.info|access-date=2018-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The energy produced is transferred to the [[Electrical grid|national grid]] via the interconnected Orapa Substation by use of two short [[Electric power transmission|132kV overhead power lines]].

[[File:The Earth seen from Apollo 17.jpg|thumb|300px|The Rare Earth hypothesis argues that planets with complex life, like [[Earth]], are exceptionally rare]]
In [[planetary astronomy]] and [[astrobiology]], the '''Rare Earth hypothesis''' argues that the [[origin of life]] and the [[evolution of biological complexity]] such as [[sexual reproduction|sexually reproducing]], [[multicellular organism]]s on [[Earth]] (and, subsequently, [[human intelligence]]) required an improbable combination of [[astrophysics|astrophysical]] and [[geology|geological]] events and circumstances.

According to the hypothesis, complex [[extraterrestrial life]] is an improbable phenomenon and likely to be rare. The term "Rare Earth" originates from ''[[Rare Earth (book)|Rare Earth: Why Complex Life Is Uncommon in the Universe]]'' (2000), a book by [[Peter Ward (paleontologist)|Peter Ward]], a geologist and paleontologist, and [[Donald E. Brownlee]], an astronomer and astrobiologist, both faculty members at the [[University of Washington]].

A contrary view was argued in the 1970s and 1980s by [[Carl Sagan]] and [[Frank Drake]], among others. It holds that Earth is a typical [[Terrestrial planet|rocky planet]] in a typical [[planetary system]], located in a non-exceptional region of a common [[barred-spiral galaxy]]. Given the [[principle of mediocrity]] (in the same vein as the [[Copernican principle]]), it is probable that we are typical, and the universe teems with complex life. However, Ward and Brownlee argue that planets, planetary systems, and galactic regions that are as friendly to complex life as the Earth, the [[Solar System]], and our [[Milky Way|galactic]] region are rare.

{{TOC limit|limit=3}}

==Requirements for complex life==
{{Life timeline}}
The Rare Earth hypothesis argues that the [[evolution of biological complexity]] requires a host of fortuitous circumstances, such as a [[galactic habitable zone]], a central star and planetary system having the requisite character, the [[circumstellar habitable zone]], a right-sized terrestrial planet, the advantage of a gas giant guardian like Jupiter and a large [[natural satellite]], conditions needed to ensure the planet has a [[magnetosphere]] and [[plate tectonics]], the chemistry of the [[lithosphere]], [[atmosphere]], and oceans, the role of "evolutionary pumps" such as massive [[glaciation]] and rare [[Meteoroid#Bolide|bolide]] impacts, and whatever led to the appearance of the [[eukaryote]] [[cell (biology)|cell]], [[sexual reproduction]] and the [[Cambrian explosion]] of [[animal]], [[plant]], and [[fungi]] [[phylum|phyla]]. The [[evolution of human intelligence]] may have required yet further events, which are extremely unlikely to have happened were it not for the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]] 66 million years ago removing [[dinosaurs]] as the dominant terrestrial [[vertebrate]]s.

In order for a small rocky planet to support complex life, Ward and Brownlee argue, the values of several variables must fall within narrow ranges. The [[universe]] is so vast that it could contain many Earth-like planets. But if such planets exist, they are likely to be separated from each other by many thousands of [[light year]]s. Such distances may preclude communication among any intelligent species evolving on such planets, which would solve the [[Fermi paradox]]: "If extraterrestrial aliens are common, why aren't they obvious?"&lt;ref name="Webb, Stephen 2002"&gt;{{harvnb|Webb|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The right location in the right kind of galaxy===
''Rare Earth'' suggests that much of the known universe, including large parts of our galaxy, are "dead zones" unable to support complex life. Those parts of a galaxy where complex life is possible make up the [[galactic habitable zone]], primarily characterized by distance from the [[Galactic Center]]. As that distance increases:
# Star [[metallicity]] declines. Metals (which in astronomy means all elements other than hydrogen and helium) are necessary to the formation of [[terrestrial planets]].
# The [[X-ray]] and [[gamma ray]] radiation from the [[Supermassive black hole|black hole]] at the galactic center, and from nearby [[neutron star]]s, becomes less intense. Thus the early universe, and present-day galactic regions where stellar density is high and [[supernova]]e are common, will be dead zones.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ward|Brownlee|2000|pp=27–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Gravitational perturbation of planets and [[planetesimals]] by nearby stars becomes less likely as the density of stars decreases. Hence the further a planet lies from the Galactic Center or a spiral arm, the less likely it is to be struck by a large [[Meteoroid#Bolide|bolide]] which could [[extinction|extinguish]] all complex life on a planet.

Item #1 rules out the outer reaches of a galaxy; #2 and #3 rule out galactic inner regions. Hence a galaxy's habitable zone may be a ring sandwiched between its uninhabitable center and outer reaches.

Also, a habitable planetary system must maintain its favorable location long enough for complex life to evolve. A star with an [[orbital eccentricity|eccentric]] (elliptic or hyperbolic) galactic orbit will pass through some spiral arms, unfavorable regions of high star density; thus a life-bearing star must have a galactic orbit that is nearly circular, with a close synchronization between the orbital velocity of the star and of the spiral arms. This further restricts the galactic habitable zone within a fairly narrow range of distances from the Galactic Center. Lineweaver et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lineweaver |first1=Charles H. |last2=Fenner |first2=Yeshe |last3=Gibson |first3=Brad K. |date=2004 |title=The Galactic Habitable Zone and the Age Distribution of Complex Life in the Milky Way |url=http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/GHZ/GHZ_astroph.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Science |volume=303 |issue=5654 |pages=59–62 |doi=10.1126/science.1092322 |pmid=14704421 |arxiv=astro-ph/0401024 |bibcode=2004Sci...303...59L |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060712034717/http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/GHZ/GHZ_astroph.pdf |archivedate=12 July 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; calculate this zone to be a ring 7 to 9 [[parsec|kiloparsecs]] in radius, including no more than 10% of the stars in the [[Milky Way]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ward|Brownlee|2000|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; about 20 to 40 billion stars. Gonzalez, et al.&lt;ref name=Gonzalez&gt;{{harvnb|Gonzalez|Brownlee|Ward|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; would halve these numbers; they estimate that at most 5% of stars in the Milky Way fall in the galactic habitable zone.

Approximately 77% of observed galaxies are spiral,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Loveday, J. |date=February 1996 |title=The APM Bright Galaxy Catalogue |journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] |volume=278 |issue=4 |pages=1025–1048 |bibcode=1996MNRAS.278.1025L |arxiv=astro-ph/9603040 |doi=10.1093/mnras/278.4.1025}}&lt;/ref&gt; two-thirds of all spiral galaxies are barred, and more than half, like the Milky Way, exhibit multiple arms.&lt;ref name="mihalas1968"&gt;{{Cite book |author=D. Mihalas |date=1968 |title=Galactic Astronomy |publisher=W. H. Freeman |isbn=978-0-7167-0326-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rare Earth, our own galaxy is unusually quiet and dim (see below), representing just 7% of its kind.&lt;ref name="HammerPuech2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hammer |first1=F. |last2=Puech |first2=M. |last3=Chemin |first3=L. |last4=Flores |first4=H. |last5=Lehnert |first5=M.

Our galaxy also appears unusually favorable in suffering fewer collisions with other galaxies over the last 10 billion years, which can cause more supernovae and other disturbances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sibling Rivalry |date=31 March 2012 |work=New Scientist |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21328586.500-milky-way-mysteries-andromeda-our-sibling-rival.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the Milky Way's central [[black hole]] seems to have neither too much nor too little activity.&lt;ref&gt;Scharf, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The orbit of the Sun around the center of the Milky Way is indeed almost perfectly circular, with [[Galactic year|a period of 226 Ma]] (million years), closely matching the rotational period of the galaxy. However, the majority of stars in barred spiral galaxies populate the spiral arms rather than the halo and tend to move in [[gravitationally aligned orbits]], so there is little that is unusual about the Sun's orbit. While the Rare Earth hypothesis predicts that the Sun should rarely, if ever, have passed through a spiral arm since its formation, astronomer Karen Masters has calculated that the orbit of the Sun takes it through a major spiral arm approximately every 100 million years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/physics/55-our-solar-system/the-sun/the-sun-in-the-milky-way/207-how-often-does-the-sun-pass-through-a-spiral-arm-in-the-milky-way-intermediate How often does the Sun pass through a spiral arm in the Milky Way?], Karen Masters, ''Curious About Astronomy''&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers have suggested that several mass extinctions do correspond with previous crossings of the spiral arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dartnell|2007|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orbiting at the right distance from the right type of star===
[[File:Estimated extent of the Solar Systems habitable zone.png|thumb|According to the hypothesis, Earth has an improbable orbit in the very narrow habitable zone (dark green) around the Sun.]]
The terrestrial example suggests that complex life requires liquid water, requiring an orbital distance neither too close nor too far from the central star, another scale of [[habitable zone]] or [[Goldilocks Principle]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hart, M.H. |title=Habitable Zones Around Main Sequence Stars |journal=Icarus |volume=37 |issue=1 |pages=351–7 |date=January 1979 |doi=10.1016/0019-1035(79)90141-6 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0019103579901416 |bibcode=1979Icar...37..351H}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The habitable zone varies with the star's type and age.

For advanced life, the star must also be highly stable, which is typical of middle star life, about 4.6 billion years old. Proper [[metallicity]] and size are also important to stability. The Sun has a low 0.1% [[solar luminosity|luminosity]] variation. To date no [[Solar analog#Solar twin|solar twin]] star twin, with an exact match of the sun's luminosity variation, has been found, though some come close. The star must have no stellar companions, as in [[Binary star|binary systems]], which would disrupt the orbits of planets. Estimates suggest 50% or more of all star systems are binary.&lt;ref&gt;[https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2013/08jan_sunclimate/ NASA, Science News, Solar Variability and Terrestrial Climate, 8 January 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="astro.unl.edu"&gt;[http://astro.unl.edu/classaction/animations/stellarprops/stellarlum.html University of Nebraska-Lincoln astronomy education group, Stellar Luminosity Calculator]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nap.edu"&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/catalog/13519/the-effects-of-solar-variability-on-earths-climate-a-workshop National Center for Atmospheric Research, The Effects of Solar Variability on Earth's Climate, 2012 Report]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2013/06/05/most-of-earths-twins-arent-identical-or-even-close/ Most of Earth’s twins aren’t identical, or even close!, by Ethan on 5 June 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; The habitable zone for a main sequence star very gradually moves out over its lifespan until it becomes a white dwarf and the habitable zone vanishes.

The liquid water and other gases available in the habitable zone bring the benefit of [[Greenhouse effect|greenhouse warming]]. Even though the [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]] contains a water vapor concentration from 0% (in arid regions) to 4% (in rain forest and ocean regions) and – as of February 2018 – only 408.05{{cn|date=February 2018}} parts per million of {{CO2}}, these small amounts suffice to raise the average surface temperature by about 40&amp;nbsp;°C,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ward|Brownlee|2000|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the dominant contribution being due to water vapor, which together with clouds makes up between 66% and 85% of Earth's greenhouse effect, with {{CO2}} contributing between 9% and 26% of the effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Gavin |last=Schmidt |title=Water vapour: feedback or forcing? |date=6 April 2005 |publisher=RealClimate |url=http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2005/04/water-vapour-feedback-or-forcing/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rocky planets must orbit within the habitable zone for life to form. Although the habitable zone of such hot stars as [[Sirius]] or [[Vega]] is wide, hot stars also emit much more [[ultraviolet radiation]] that [[ionize]]s any planetary [[Celestial body atmosphere|atmosphere]]. They may become [[red giant]]s before advanced life [[Evolution|evolve]]s on their planets.
These considerations rule out the massive and powerful stars of type F6 to O (see [[stellar classification]]) as homes to evolved [[metazoan life]].

Small [[red dwarf]] stars conversely have small [[habitable zone]]s wherein planets are in [[tidal lock]], with one very hot side always facing the star and another very cold side; and they are also at increased risk of solar flares (see [[Aurelia and Blue Moon#Aurelia|Aurelia]]). Life therefore cannot arise in such systems. Rare Earth proponents claim that only stars from F7 to K1 types are hospitable. Such stars are rare: G type stars such as the Sun (between the hotter F and cooler K) comprise only 9%&lt;ref name="RECONS1"&gt;[http://joy.chara.gsu.edu/RECONS/TOP100.posted.htm] The One Hundred Nearest Star Systems, Research Consortium on Nearby Stars.&lt;/ref&gt; of the hydrogen-burning stars in the Milky Way.

Such aged stars as [[red giant]]s and [[white dwarf]]s are also unlikely to support life. Red giants are common in globular clusters and [[elliptical galaxy|elliptical galaxies]]. White dwarfs are mostly dying stars that have already completed their red giant phase. Stars that become red giants expand into or overheat the habitable zones of their youth and middle age (though theoretically planets at a much greater distance [[Red giant#Prospects for habitability|may become habitable]]).

An energy output that varies with the lifetime of the star will likely prevent life (e.g., as [[Cepheid variable]]s). A sudden decrease, even if brief, may freeze the water of orbiting planets, and a significant increase may evaporate it and cause a [[greenhouse effect]] that prevents the oceans from reforming.

All known life requires the complex chemistry of [[metallicity|metallic]] elements. The [[absorption spectrum]] of a star reveals the presence of metals within, and studies of stellar spectra reveal that many, perhaps most, stars are poor in metals. Because heavy metals originate in [[supernova]] explosions, metallicity increases in the universe over time. Low metallicity characterizes the early universe: globular clusters and other stars that formed when the universe was young, stars in most galaxies other than large [[spiral galaxy|spirals]], and stars in the outer regions of all galaxies. Metal-rich central stars capable of supporting complex life are therefore believed to be most common in the quiet suburbs{{vague|date=March 2017}} of the larger spiral galaxies—where radiation also happens to be weak.&lt;ref name="Ward 2000 15–33"&gt;{{harvnb|Ward|Brownlee|2000|pp=15–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===With the right arrangement of planets===
[[File:Planets2013.jpg|right|thumb|Depiction of the Sun and planets of the Solar System and the sequence of planets. Rare Earth argues that without such an arrangement, in particular the presence of the massive gas giant Jupiter (fifth planet from the Sun and the largest), complex life on Earth would not have arisen.]]
Rare Earth proponents argue that a planetary system capable of sustaining complex life must be structured more or less like the Solar System, with small and rocky inner planets and outer gas giants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/08/070827-jupiter-comets_2.html |first=Anne |last=Minard |date=27 August 2007 |title=Jupiter Both an Impact Source and Shield for Earth |accessdate=14 January 2014 |quote=without the long, peaceful periods offered by Jupiter's shield, intelligent life on Earth would never have been able to take hold.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without the protection of 'celestial vacuum cleaner' planets with strong gravitational pull, a planet would be subject to more catastrophic asteroid collisions.

Observations of exo-planets have shown that arrangements of planets similar to our Solar System are rare. Most planetary systems have super Earths, several times larger than Earth, close to their star, whereas our Solar System's inner region has only a few small rocky planets and none inside Mercury's orbit. Only 10% of stars have giant planets similar to Jupiter and Saturn, and those few rarely have stable nearly circular orbits distant from their star. [[Konstantin Batygin]] and colleagues argue that these features can be explained if, early in the history of the Solar System, Jupiter and Saturn drifted towards the Sun, sending showers of planetesimals towards the super-Earths which sent them spiralling into the Sun, and ferrying icy building blocks into the terrestrial region of the Solar System which provided the building blocks for the rocky planets. The two giant planets then drifted out again to their present position. However, in the view of Batygin and his colleagues: "The concatenation of chance events required for this delicate choreography suggest that small, Earth-like rocky planets – and perhaps life itself – could be rare throughout the cosmos."&lt;ref&gt;Batygin et al., pp. 23-24&lt;/ref&gt;

===A continuously stable orbit===
Rare Earth argues that a gas giant must not be too close to a body where life is developing. Close placement of gas giant(s) could disrupt the orbit of a potential life-bearing planet, either directly or by drifting into the habitable zone.

Newtonian dynamics can produce [[n-body problem#Three-body problem|chaotic planetary orbits]], especially in a system having [[Jovian planets|large planets]] at high [[orbital eccentricity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.astro.ku.dk/~tobiash/posters/Tobias_final_new.pdf |format=PDF |title=Chaos and Planet-Particle Dynamics within the Habitable Zone of Extrasolar Planetary Systems (A qualitative numerical stability study) |accessdate=31 October 2007 |last=Hinse |first=T.C. |publisher=Niels Bohr Institute |quote=Main simulation results observed: [1] The presence of high-order mean-motion resonances for large values of giant planet eccentricity [2] Chaos dominated dynamics within the habitable zone(s) at large values of giant planet mass.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The need for stable orbits rules out [[Extrasolar planet|stars with systems of planets]] that contain large planets with orbits close to the host star (called "[[hot Jupiters]]"). It is believed that hot Jupiters have migrated inwards to their current orbits. In the process, they would have catastrophically disrupted the orbits of any planets in the habitable zone.&lt;ref&gt;"Once you realize that most of the known extrasolar planets have highly eccentric orbits (like the planets in Upsilon Andromedae), you begin to wonder if there might be something special about our solar system" (UCBerkeleyNews quoting Extra solar planetary researcher Eric Ford.) {{Cite web |url=http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2005/04/13_planet.shtml |first=Robert |last=Sanders |date=13 April 2005 |title=Wayward planet knocks extrasolar planets for a loop |accessdate=31 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; To exacerbate matters, hot Jupiters are much more common orbiting F and G class stars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solstation.com/habitable.htm Sol Company, Stars and Habitable Planets, 2012] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628175616/http://www.solstation.com/habitable.htm |date=28 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===A terrestrial planet of the right size===
[[File:Size planets comparison.jpg|upright=1.4|thumb|left|Planets of the Solar System to scale. Rare Earth argues that complex life cannot exist on large gaseous planets like Jupiter and Saturn (top row) or Uranus and Neptune (top middle) or smaller planets such as Mars and Mercury]]
It is argued that life requires terrestrial planets like Earth and as gas giants lack such a surface, that complex life cannot arise there.&lt;ref&gt;Ward &amp; Brownlee pg 220&lt;/ref&gt;

A planet that is too small cannot hold much atmosphere, making surface temperature low and variable and oceans impossible. A small planet will also tend to have a rough surface, with large mountains and deep canyons. The core will cool faster, and [[plate tectonics]] may be brief or entirely absent. A planet that is too large will retain too dense an atmosphere like [[Venus]]. Although Venus is similar in size and mass to Earth, its surface atmospheric pressure is 92 times that of Earth, and surface temperature of 735 K (462&amp;nbsp;°C; 863&amp;nbsp;°F). Earth had a similar early atmosphere to Venus, but may have lost it in the [[Giant-impact hypothesis|giant impact event]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lissauer|1999}}, as summarized by {{harvnb|Conway Morris|2003|p=92}}; also see {{harvnb|Comins|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===With plate tectonics===
[[File:Great American Biotic Interchange examples.svg|thumb|The [[Great American Interchange]] on Earth, around ~ 3.5 to 3 Ma, an example of species competition, resulting from continental plate interaction]]

Rare Earth proponents argue that [[plate tectonics]] and a strong [[Earth's magnetic field|magnetic field]] are essential for  [[biodiversity]], [[global temperature regulation]], and the [[carbon cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ward|Brownlee|2000|p=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The lack of [[mountain chain]]s elsewhere in the Solar System is direct evidence that Earth is the only body with plate tectonics, and thus the only nearby body capable of supporting life.&lt;ref&gt; {{harvnb|Ward|Brownlee|2000|p=200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plate tectonics depend on the right chemical composition and a long-lasting source of heat from [[radioactive decay]]. Continents must be made of less dense [[felsic]] rocks that "float" on underlying denser [[mafic]] rock. Taylor&lt;ref name=Taylor98/&gt; emphasizes that tectonic [[subduction]] zones require the lubrication of oceans of water. Plate tectonics also provides a means of [[Biogeochemical cycle|biochemical cycling]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.space.com/4076-plate-tectonics-essential-alien-life.html Plate Tectonics Could Be Essential for Alien Life], By Lee Pullen, Astrobiology Magazine, February 19, 2009, SPACE.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Plate tectonics and as a result [[continental drift]] and the creation of separate land masses would create diversified [[ecosystem]]s and [[biodiversity]], one of the strongest defences against extinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|Ward, R. D. &amp; Brownlee, D.}} 2000. ''[http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/geophys/platelif.html Plate tectonics essential for complex evolution]'' - [[Rare Earth (book)|Rare Earth]] - [[Copernicus Books]]&lt;/ref&gt; An example of species diversification and later competition on Earth's continents is the [[Great American Interchange]]. North and Middle America drifted into [[South America]] at around 3.5 to 3 Ma. The [[fauna]] of South America evolved separately for about 30 million years, since [[Antarctica]] separated. Many species were subsequently wiped out in mainly South America by competing [[North America|Northern American]] animals.

===A large moon===
[[File:Porto Covo February 2009-2.jpg|thumb|left|Tide pools resulting from tidal interaction of the Moon are said to have promoted the evolution of complex life.]]
The Moon is unusual because the other rocky planets in the Solar System either have no satellites ([[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and [[Venus]]), or only tiny satellites which are probably captured asteroids ([[Mars]]).

The [[Giant-impact hypothesis|Giant-impact theory]] hypothesizes that the Moon resulted from the impact of a [[Mars]]-sized body, dubbed [[Theia (planet)|Theia]], with the young Earth. This giant impact also gave the Earth its [[axial tilt]]  (inclination) and velocity of rotation.&lt;ref name=Taylor98&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rapid rotation reduces the daily variation in temperature and makes [[photosynthesis]] viable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/earth-rotation-summer-solstice/ scientificamerican.com, Fact or Fiction: The Days (and Nights) Are Getting Longer, By Adam Hadhazy, 14 June 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Rare Earth'' hypothesis further argues that the axial tilt cannot be too large or too small (relative to the [[orbital plane (astronomy)|orbital plane]]). A planet with a large tilt will experience extreme seasonal variations in climate. A planet with little or no tilt will lack the stimulus to evolution that climate variation provides.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} In this view, the Earth's tilt is "just right". The gravity of a large satellite also stabilizes the planet's tilt; without this effect the [[precession|variation in tilt]] would be [[Chaos theory|chaotic]], probably making complex life forms on land impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dartnell|2007|pp=69–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the Earth had no Moon, the ocean [[tide]]s resulting solely from the Sun's gravity would be only half that of the lunar tides. A large satellite gives rise to [[tidal pool]]s, which may be essential for the formation of [[macromolecule|complex life]], though this is far from certain.&lt;ref&gt;A formal description of the hypothesis is given in: {{Cite journal |last=Lathe |first=Richard |date=March 2004 |title=Fast tidal cycling and the origin of life |journal=[[Icarus (journal)|Icarus]] |volume=168 |issue=1 |pages=18–22 |quote=tidal cycling, resembling the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) mechanism, could only replicate and amplify DNA-like polymers. This mechanism suggests constraints on the evolution of extra-terrestrial life. |doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2003.10.018 |bibcode=2004Icar..168...18L |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001910350300383X}} It is taught less formally here: {{Cite web |url=http://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/ast121/lectures/lec25.html |title=Origin of Life |accessdate=31 October 2007 |first=James |last=Schombert |publisher=University of Oregon |quote=with the vastness of the Earth's oceans it is statistically very improbable that these early proteins would ever link up. The solution is that the huge tides from the Moon produced inland tidal pools, which would fill and evaporate on a regular basis to produce high concentrations of amino acids.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large satellite also increases the likelihood of [[plate tectonics]] through the effect of [[tidal force]]s on the planet's crust.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} The impact that formed the Moon may also have initiated plate tectonics, without which the [[continental crust]] would cover the entire planet, leaving no room for [[oceanic crust]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} It is possible that the large scale [[mantle convection]] needed to drive plate tectonics could not have emerged in the absence of crustal inhomogeneity. A further theory indicates that such a large moon may also contribute to maintaining a planet's magnetic shield by continually acting upon a metallic planetary core as dynamo, thus protecting the surface of the planet from charged particles and cosmic rays, and helping to ensure the atmosphere is not stripped over time by solar winds.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

[[File:Earth's atmosphere.svg|thumb|right|Earth's atmosphere]]

===Atmosphere===
A terrestrial planet of the right size is needed to retain an atmosphere, like Earth and Venus. On Earth, once the giant impact of [[Theia (planet)|Theia]] thinned [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]], other events were needed to make the atmosphere capable of sustaining life. The [[Late Heavy Bombardment]] reseeded Earth with water lost after the impact of Theia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.space.com/27969-earth-water-from-asteroids-not-comets.html Space.com, Most of Earth's Water Came from Asteroids, Not Comets, By Charles Q.

===One or more evolutionary triggers for complex life===
[[File:Evolsex-dia1a.png|thumb|This diagram illustrates the ''twofold cost of sex''. If each individual were to contribute to the same number of offspring (two), ''(a)'' the sexual population remains the same size each generation, where the ''(b)'' asexual population doubles in size each generation]]
Regardless of whether planets with similar physical attributes to the Earth are rare or not, some argue that life usually remains simple bacteria. Biochemist [[Nick Lane]] argues that simple cells ([[prokaryote]]s) emerged soon after Earth's formation, but since almost half the planet's life had passed before they evolved into complex ones ([[eukaryote]]s) all of whom share a [[common ancestor]], this event can only have happened once. In some views, [[prokaryote]]s lack the cellular architecture to evolve into eukaryotes because a bacterium expanded up to eukaryotic proportions would have tens of thousands of times less energy available; two billion years ago, one simple cell incorporated itself into another, multiplied, and evolved into [[mitochondria]] that supplied the vast increase in available energy that enabled the evolution of complex life. If this incorporation occurred only once in four billion years or is otherwise unlikely, then life on most planets remains simple.&lt;ref&gt;Lane, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative view is that mitochondria evolution was environmentally triggered, and that mitochondria-containing organisms appeared soon after the first traces of atmospheric oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, W. &amp; Mentel, M. (2010)[http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/the-origin-of-mitochondria-14232356# The Origin of Mitochondria. Nature Education] 3(9):58&lt;/ref&gt;

The evolution and persistence of [[evolution of sexual reproduction|sexual reproduction]] is another mystery in biology. The purpose of [[sexual reproduction]] is unclear, as in many organisms it has a 50% cost (fitness disadvantage) in relation to [[asexual reproduction]].&lt;ref&gt;Ridley M (2004) Evolution, 3rd edition. Blackwell Publishing, p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mating type]]s (types of [[gamete]]s, according to their compatibility) may have arisen as a result of [[anisogamy]] (gamete dimorphism), or the male and female genders may have evolved before anisogamy.&lt;ref&gt;T. Togashi, P. Cox (Eds.) ''The Evolution of Anisogamy''. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge; 2011, p. 22-29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beukeboom, L. &amp; Perrin, N. (2014). ''The Evolution of Sex Determination''. Oxford University Press, p. 25 [https://books.google.com/books?id=d4cLBAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;pg=PA25#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]. Online resources, [http://www.oup.co.uk/companion/beukeboom].&lt;/ref&gt; It is also unknown why most sexual organisms use a binary [[mating system]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Czárán |first1=T.L. |last2=Hoekstra |first2=R.F. |year=2006 |title=Evolution of sexual asymmetry |url=|journal=BMC Evolutionary Biology |volume=4 |issue=|pages=34–46 |doi=10.1186/1471-2148-4-34}}&lt;/ref&gt; and why some organisms have gamete dimorphism. [[Charles Darwin]] was the first to suggest that [[sexual selection]] drives [[speciation]]; without it, complex life would probably not have evolved.

===The right time in evolution===
[[File:Timeline evolution of life.svg|left|thumb|Timeline of evolution; [[History of writing|human writings]] exists for only 0.000218% of Earth's history.]] 
While life on Earth is regarded to have spawned relatively early in the planet's history, the evolution from multicellular to intelligent organisms took around 800 million years.&lt;ref&gt;{{en icon}} [http://www.ita.uni-heidelberg.de/~ulm/papers/ECh7.pdf 800 million years for complex organ evolution] - [[Heidelberg University]]&lt;/ref&gt; Civilizations on Earth have existed for about 12,000 years and radio communication reaching space has existed for less than 100 years. Relative to the age of the Solar System (~4.57 Ga) this is a short time, in which extreme climatic variations, super volcanoes, and large meteorite impacts were absent. These events would severely harm intelligent life, as well as life in general. For example, the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event|Permian-Triassic mass extinction]], caused by widespread and continuous volcanic eruptions in an area the size of Western Europe, led to the extinction of 95% of known species around 251.2 [[Mega-annum|Ma]] ago. About 65 million years ago, the [[Chicxulub crater|Chicxulub]] impact at the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary]] (~65.5 Ma) on the [[Yucatán peninsula]] in [[Mexico]] led to a mass extinction of the most advanced species at that time.

If there were intelligent extraterrestrial civilizations able to make contact with distant Earth, they would have to live in the same 12Ka period of the 800Ma evolution of life.

==Rare Earth equation==
The following discussion is adapted from Cramer.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cramer|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rare Earth equation is Ward and Brownlee's [[riposte]] to the [[Drake equation]]. It calculates &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, the number of Earth-like planets in the Milky Way having complex life forms, as:
[[File:Pikaia gracilens B.jpg|thumb|upright|According to Rare Earth, the Cambrian explosion that saw extreme diversification of [[chordata]] from simple forms like Pikaia (pictured) was an improbable event]]
:&lt;math&gt;N=N^* \cdot n_e \cdot f_g \cdot f_p \cdot f_{pm} \cdot f_i \cdot f_c \cdot f_l \cdot f_m \cdot f_j \cdot f_{me}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ward|Brownlee|2000|pp=271–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

where:
* ''N*'' is the number of stars in the [[Milky Way]]. This number is not well-estimated, because the Milky Way's mass is not well estimated, with little information about the number of small stars. ''N*'' is at least 100 billion, and may be as high as 500 billion, if there are many low visibility stars.
* &lt;math&gt;n_e&lt;/math&gt; is the average number of planets in a star's habitable zone. This zone is fairly narrow, because constrained by the requirement that the average planetary temperature be consistent with water remaining liquid throughout the time required for complex life to evolve. Thus &lt;math&gt;n_e&lt;/math&gt;=1 is a likely upper bound.
We assume &lt;math&gt;N^* \cdot n_e=5\cdot10^{11}&lt;/math&gt;. The Rare Earth hypothesis can then be viewed as asserting that the product of the other nine Rare Earth equation factors listed below, which are all fractions, is no greater than 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; and could plausibly be as small as 10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt;. In the latter case, &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; could be as small as 0 or 1. Ward and Brownlee do not actually calculate the value of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, because the numerical values of quite a few of the factors below can only be conjectured. They cannot be estimated simply because [[Anthropic principle|we have but one data point]]: the Earth, a rocky planet orbiting a [[Stellar classification#Class G|G2]] star in a quiet suburb of a large [[barred spiral galaxy]], and the home of the only intelligent species we know, namely ourselves.
* &lt;math&gt;f_g&lt;/math&gt; is the fraction of stars in the galactic habitable zone (Ward, Brownlee, and Gonzalez estimate this factor as 0.1&lt;ref name=Gonzalez/&gt;).
* &lt;math&gt;f_p&lt;/math&gt; is the fraction of stars in the [[Milky Way]] with planets.
* &lt;math&gt;f_{pm}&lt;/math&gt; is the fraction of planets that are rocky ("metallic") rather than gaseous.
* &lt;math&gt;f_i&lt;/math&gt; is the fraction of habitable planets where microbial life arises. Ward and Brownlee believe this fraction is unlikely to be small.
* &lt;math&gt;f_c&lt;/math&gt; is the fraction of planets where complex life evolves. For 80% of the time since microbial life first appeared on the Earth, there was only bacterial life. Hence Ward and Brownlee argue that this fraction may be small.
* &lt;math&gt;f_l&lt;/math&gt; is the fraction of the total lifespan of a planet during which complex life is present. Complex life cannot endure indefinitely, because the energy put out by the sort of star that allows complex life to emerge gradually rises, and the central star eventually becomes a [[red giant]], engulfing all planets in the planetary habitable zone. Also, given enough time, a catastrophic extinction of all complex life becomes ever more likely.
* &lt;math&gt;f_m&lt;/math&gt; is the fraction of habitable planets with a large moon. If the [[giant impact theory]] of the Moon's origin is correct, this fraction is small.
* &lt;math&gt;f_j&lt;/math&gt; is the fraction of planetary systems with large Jovian planets. This fraction could be large.
* &lt;math&gt;f_{me}&lt;/math&gt; is the fraction of planets with a sufficiently low number of extinction events. Ward and Brownlee argue that the low number of such events the Earth has experienced since the [[Cambrian explosion]] may be unusual, in which case this fraction would be small.

The Rare Earth equation, unlike the [[Drake equation]], does not factor the probability that complex life evolves into [[intelligence|intelligent life]] that discovers technology (Ward and Brownlee are not [[evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologists]]). Barrow and Tipler&lt;ref&gt;{{BarrowTipler1986}} Section 3.2&lt;/ref&gt; review the consensus among such biologists that the evolutionary path from primitive Cambrian [[chordate]]s, e.g., ''[[Pikaia]]'' to ''[[Homo sapiens]]'', was a highly improbable event. For example, the large [[brain]]s of humans have marked adaptive disadvantages, requiring as they do an expensive [[metabolism]], a long [[gestation period]], and a childhood lasting more than 25% of the average total life span. Other improbable features of humans include:
*Being one of a handful of extant [[bipedal]] land (non-avian) [[vertebrate]]. Combined with an unusual [[eye–hand coordination]], this permits dextrous manipulations of the physical environment with the [[hand]]s;
*A [[vocal folds|vocal apparatus]] far more expressive{{citation needed|reason=What about dolphins? Their ability to communicate complex ideas is indisputable. Also, dolphins clearly have culture.|date=August 2016}} than that of any other mammal, enabling [[speech]]. Speech makes it possible for humans to interact cooperatively, to share knowledge, and to acquire a culture;
*The capability of formulating [[abstraction]]s to a degree permitting the invention of [[mathematics]], and the discovery of [[science]] and [[technology]]. Only recently did humans acquire anything like their current scientific and technological sophistication.

==Advocates==
Writers who support the Rare Earth hypothesis:
* [[Stuart Ross Taylor]],&lt;ref name=Taylor98/&gt; a specialist on the Solar System, firmly believes in the hypothesis. Taylor concludes that the Solar System is probably unusual, because it resulted from so many chance factors and events.
* Stephen Webb,&lt;ref name="Webb, Stephen 2002"/&gt; a physicist, mainly presents and rejects candidate solutions for the [[Fermi paradox]]. The Rare Earth hypothesis emerges as one of the few solutions left standing by the end of the book.
* [[Simon Conway Morris]], a [[paleontologist]], endorses the Rare Earth hypothesis in chapter 5 of his ''Life's Solution: Inevitable Humans in a Lonely Universe'',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Conway Morris|2003|loc=Ch. 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cites Ward and Brownlee's book with approval.&lt;ref&gt;Conway Morris, 2003, p. 344, n. 1&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[John D. Barrow]] and [[Frank J. Tipler]] (1986. 3.2, 8.7, 9), [[cosmologist]]s, vigorously defend the hypothesis that humans are likely to be the only intelligent life in the [[Milky Way]], and perhaps the entire universe. But this hypothesis is not central to their book ''The Anthropic Cosmological Principle'', a thorough study of the [[anthropic principle]] and of how the laws of physics are peculiarly suited to enable the emergence of complexity in nature.
* [[Ray Kurzweil]], a computer pioneer and self-proclaimed [[Singularitarian]], argues in ''[[The Singularity Is Near]]'' that the coming [[Technological singularity|Singularity]] requires that Earth be the first planet on which sentient, technology-using life evolved. Although other Earth-like planets could exist, Earth must be the most evolutionarily advanced, because otherwise we would have seen evidence that another culture had experienced the [[Technological singularity|Singularity]] and expanded to harness the full computational capacity of the physical universe.

=={{anchor|Criticism}}Criticism==
Cases against the Rare Earth Hypothesis take various forms.

===Anthropic reasoning===
The hypothesis concludes, more or less, that complex life is rare because it can evolve only on the surface of an Earth-like planet or on a suitable satellite of a planet. Some biologists, such as [[Jack Cohen (scientist)|Jack Cohen]], believe this assumption too restrictive and unimaginative; they see it as a form of [[begging the question|circular reasoning]].

According to [[David Darling (astronomer)|David Darling]], the Rare Earth hypothesis is neither [[hypothesis]] nor [[prediction]], but merely a description of how life arose on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darling|2001|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his view Ward and Brownlee have done nothing more than select the factors that best suit their case.

&lt;blockquote&gt;What matters is not whether there's anything unusual about the Earth; there's going to be something [[idiosyncratic]] about every planet in space. What matters is whether any of Earth's circumstances are not only unusual but also essential for complex life. So far we've seen nothing to suggest there is.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darling|2001|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Critics also argue that there is a link between the Rare Earth Hypothesis and the [[creationist]] ideas of [[intelligent design]].&lt;ref&gt;Frazier, Kendrick. 'Was the 'Rare Earth' Hypothesis Influenced by a Creationist?' The Skeptical Inquirer. 1 November 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

However, [[Planetary habitability#Red dwarf systems|some exobiologists have suggested]] that stars outside this range may give [[Abiogenesis|rise to life]] under the right circumstances; this possibility is a central point of contention to the theory because these late-K and M category stars make up about 82% of all hydrogen-burning stars.&lt;ref name="RECONS1"/&gt;

Current technology limits the testing of important Rare Earth criteria: surface water, tectonic plates, a large moon and [[biosignature]]s are currently undetectable.

Some argue that Rare Earth's estimates of rocky planets in habitable zones (&lt;math&gt;n_e&lt;/math&gt; in the Rare Earth equation) are too restrictive.

The requirement for a system to have a Jovian planet as protector (Rare Earth equation factor &lt;math&gt;f_j&lt;/math&gt;) has been challenged, affecting the number of proposed extinction events (Rare Earth equation factor &lt;math&gt;f_{me}&lt;/math&gt;).

===Plate tectonics may not be unique to Earth or a requirement for complex life===
[[File:NH-Pluto-SputnikPlanum-HillaryMontes-NorgayMontes-20150714.jpg|thumb|left|Geological discoveries like the active features of Pluto's [[Tombaugh Regio]] appear to contradict the argument that geologically active worlds like Earth are rare.&lt;ref name="NASA-20150724-lg"&gt;{{cite web |last=Gipson |first=Lillian |title=New Horizons Discovers Flowing Ices on Pluto |url=http://www.nasa.gov/feature/new-horizons-discovers-flowing-ices-on-pluto |date=24 July 2015 |work=[[NASA]] |accessdate=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Ward and Brownlee argue that for complex life to evolve (Rare Earth equation factor &lt;math&gt;f_c&lt;/math&gt;), [[tectonics]] must be present to generate [[biogeochemical cycles]], and predicted that such geological features would not be found outside of Earth, pointing to a lack of observable mountain ranges and [[orogenic|subduction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ward|Brownlee|2000|pp=191–193}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is, however, no scientific consensus on the evolution of plate tectonics on Earth. Though it is believed that tectonic motion first began around three billion years ago,&lt;ref name="Kranendonk2011"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Kranendonk |first1=V. |last2=Martin |first2=J. |title=Onset of Plate Tectonics |doi=10.1126/science.1208766 |journal=Science |volume=333 |issue=6041 |pages=413–414 |year=2011 |pmid=21778389 |pmc=|bibcode=2011Sci...333..413V}}&lt;/ref&gt; by this time photosynthesis and oxygenation had already begun. Furthermore, recent studies point to plate tectonics as an episodic planetary phenomenon, and that life may evolve during periods of "stagnant-lid" rather than plate tectonic states.&lt;ref name="O’NeillLenardic2016"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=O’Neill |first1=Craig |last2=Lenardic |first2=Adrian |last3=Weller |first3=Matthew |last4=Moresi |first4=Louis |last5=Quenette |first5=Steve |last6=Zhang |first6=Siqi |title=A window for plate tectonics in terrestrial planet evolution? |journal=Physics of the Earth and Planetary Interiors |volume=255 |year=2016 |pages=80–92 |doi=10.1016/j.pepi.2016.04.002|bibcode=2016PEPI..255...80O }}&lt;/ref&gt;

NASA scientists Hartman and McKay argue that plate tectonics may in fact slow the rise of oxygenation (and thus stymie complex life rather than promote it).&lt;ref&gt;Hartman H, McKay CP "Oxygenic photosynthesis and the oxidation state of Mars." Planet Space Sci. 1995 Jan-Feb;43(1-2):123-8.&lt;/ref&gt; Computer modelling by Tilman Spohn in 2014 found that plate tectonics on Earth may have arisen from the effects of complex life's emergence, rather than the other way around as the Rare Earth might suggest. The action of lichens on rock may have contributed to the formation of subduction zones in the presence of water.&lt;ref name=Choi2014&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Does a Planet Need Life to Create Continents?

====A magnetic field may not be a requirement====
The importance of Earth's magnetic field to the development of complex life has been disputed. Kasting argues that the atmosphere provides sufficient protection against cosmic rays even during times of magnetic pole reversal and atmosphere loss by sputtering.&lt;ref name="Kasting 2001"/&gt; Kasting also dismisses the role of the magnetic field in the evolution of eukaryotes, citing the age of the oldest known [[magnetofossils]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kasting|2001|pp=128–129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===A large moon may neither be rare nor necessary===
The requirement of a large moon (Rare Earth equation factor &lt;math&gt;f_m&lt;/math&gt;) has also been challenged. Even if it were required, such an occurrence may not be as unique as predicted by the Rare Earth Hypothesis. Recent work by [[Edward Belbruno]] and [[J. Richard Gott]] of Princeton University suggests that giant impactors such as those that may have formed the [[Moon]] can indeed form in planetary [[trojan points]] ({{L4}} or {{L5}} [[Lagrangian point]]) which means that similar circumstances may occur in other planetary systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=E. |last=Belbruno |author2=J. Richard Gott III |journal=The Astronomical Journal |volume=129 |issue=3 |pages=1724–45 |date=2005 |title=Where Did The Moon Come From? |arxiv=astro-ph/0405372 |doi=10.1086/427539 |bibcode=2005AJ....129.1724B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Artist's concept of collision at HD 172555.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Collision between two planetary bodies (artist concept).]]

Rare Earth's assertion that the Moon's stabilization of Earth's obliquity and spin is a requirement for complex life has been questioned. Kasting argues that a moonless Earth would still possess habitats with climates suitable for complex life and questions whether the spin rate of a moonless Earth can be predicted.&lt;ref name="Kasting 2001"/&gt; Although the [[giant impact theory]] posits that the impact forming the Moon increased Earth's rotational speed to make a day about 5 hours long, the Moon has slowly "[[Tidal deceleration#Tidal deceleration|stolen]]" much of this speed to reduce Earth's solar day since then to about 24 hours and continues to do so: in 100 million years Earth's solar day will be roughly 24 hours 38 minutes (the same as Mars's solar day); in 1 billion years, 30 hours 23 minutes. Larger secondary bodies would exert proportionally larger tidal forces that would in turn decelerate their primaries faster and potentially increase the solar day of a planet in all other respects like Earth to over 120 hours within a few billion years. This long solar day would make effective heat dissipation for organisms in the tropics and subtropics extremely difficult in a similar manner to tidal locking to a red dwarf star. Short days (high rotation speed) causes high wind speeds at ground level. Long days (slow rotation speed) cause the day and night temperatures to be too extreme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.discovery.com/earth/what-would-happen-if-our-planet-became-tidally-locked-130202.htm discovery.com What If Earth Became Tidally Locked? 2 February 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Rare Earth proponents argue that the Earth's plate tectonics would probably not exist if not for the tidal forces of the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;Ward &amp; Brownlee 2000, p. 233&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Nick |first=Hoffman |url=http://www.spacedaily.com/news/life-01x1.html |title=The Moon And Plate Tectonics: Why We Are Alone |work=Space Daily |date=11 June 2001 |accessdate=8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hypothesis that the Moon's tidal influence initiated or sustained Earth's plate tectonics remains unproven, though at least one study implies a temporal correlation to the formation of the Moon.&lt;ref name="TurnerRushmer2014"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Turner |first1=S. |last2=Rushmer |first2=T. |last3=Reagan |first3=M. |last4=Moyen |first4=J.-F. |title=Heading down early on?

Kasting argues that a large moon is not required to initiate plate tectonics.&lt;ref name="Kasting 2001"/&gt;

===Complex life may arise in alternative habitats===
[[File:Blacksmoker in Atlantic Ocean.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Complex life may exist in environments similar to [[black smoker]]s on Earth.]]
{{see also|Hypothetical types of biochemistry}}
Rare Earth proponents argue that simple life may be common, though complex life requires specific environmental conditions to arise. Critics consider life could arise on a [[natural satellite|moon]] of a gas giant, though this is less likely if life requires volcanicity. The moon must have stresses to induce tidal heating, but not so dramatic as seen on Jupiter's Io. However, the moon is within the gas giant's intense radiation belts, sterilizing any biodiversity before it can get established. [[Dirk Schulze-Makuch]] disputes this, hypothesizing alternative biochemistries for alien life.&lt;ref name="Schulze-MakuchIrwin2008"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Dirk Schulze-Makuch |author2=Louis Neal Irwin |title=Life in the Universe: Expectations and Constraints |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qdjoTGAvrkkC&amp;pg=PA1 |date=2 October 2008 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn=978-3-540-76816-6 |pages=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Rare Earth proponents argue that only microbial extremophiles could exist in subsurface habitats beyond Earth, some argue that complex life can also arise in these environments. Examples of extremophile animals such as the ''[[Hesiocaeca methanicola]]'', an animal that inhabits ocean floor [[methane clathrate]]s substances more commonly found in the outer Solar System, the [[tardigrade]]s which can survive in the vacuum of space&lt;ref name="NYT-20150907"&gt;{{cite news |last=Dean |first=Cornelia |title=The Tardigrade: Practically Invisible, Indestructible ‘Water Bears’ |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/08/science/the-tardigrade-water-bear.html |date=7 September 2015 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''[[Halicephalobus mephisto]]'' which exists in crushing pressure, scorching temperatures and extremely low oxygen levels 3.6 kilometres deep in the Earth's crust,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2011/06/110601-deepest-worm-earth-devil-science-animals-life/ |title=New "Devil Worm" Is Deepest-Living Animal Species evolved to withstand heat and crushing pressure |last1=Mosher |first1=Dave |last2=|first2=|date=2 June 2011 |website=National Geographic News |publisher=|access-date=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; are sometimes cited by critics as complex life capable of thriving in "alien" environments.

[[File:Orion1 big.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Airglow made visible from aboard the [[International Space Station|ISS]]]]

'''Sky brightness''' refers to the [[visual perception]] of the [[sky]] and how it [[light scattering|scatters]] and [[diffuse sky radiation|diffuses]] light. The fact that the sky is not completely dark at [[night]] is easily visible. If light sources (e.g. the [[moonlight|Moon]] and [[light pollution]]) were removed from the [[night sky]], it would appear absolutely dark. [[Silhouette]]s of objects against the sky itself would not be visible.

The sky's brightness varies greatly over the day, and the primary cause differs as well. During [[daytime]], when the [[Sun]] is above the horizon, the [[Rayleigh scattering|direct scattering]] of [[sunlight]] is the overwhelmingly dominant source of light. During [[twilight]] (the duration after [[sunset]] or before [[sunrise]] until or since, respectively, the full darkness of night), the situation is more complicated, and a further differentiation is required.

Twilight (both [[dusk]] and [[dawn]]) is divided into three 6° segments that mark the Sun's position below the horizon. At [[civil twilight]], the center of the Sun's disk appears to be between 1/4° and 6° below the horizon. At [[nautical twilight]], the Sun's [[horizontal coordinate system|altitude]] is between –6° and –12°. At [[astronomical twilight]], the Sun is between –12° and –18°. When the Sun's depth is more than 18°, the sky generally attains its maximum darkness.

Sources of the night sky's intrinsic brightness include [[airglow]], indirect scattering of [[sunlight]], scattering of [[starlight]], and [[skyglow|light pollution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=F. Patat |url=http://www.eso.org/~fpatat/science/skybright/ |title=The Brightness of the Night Sky |publisher=[[European Southern Observatory|ESO]] |accessdate=2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Airglow==
When physicist [[Anders Ångström]] examined the spectrum of the [[aurora borealis]], he discovered that even on nights when the aurora was absent, its characteristic green line was still present. It was not until the 1920s that scientists were beginning to identify and understand the [[emission line]]s in aurorae and of the sky itself, and what was causing them. The green line Angstrom observed is in fact an emission line with a wavelength of 557.7&amp;nbsp;nm, caused by the recombination of oxygen in the upper atmosphere.

Airglow is the collective name of the various processes in the upper atmosphere that result in the emission of photons, with the driving force being primarily [[ultraviolet|UV radiation]] from the Sun. Several emission lines are dominant: a green line from oxygen at 557.7&amp;nbsp;nm, a yellow doublet from sodium at 589.0 and 589.6&amp;nbsp;nm, and red lines from oxygen at 630.0 and 636.4&amp;nbsp;nm.

The sodium emissions come from a thin [[sodium layer]] approximately 10&amp;nbsp;km thick at an altitude of 90–100&amp;nbsp;km, above the [[mesopause]] and in the D-layer of the [[ionosphere]]. The red oxygen lines originate at altitudes of about 300&amp;nbsp;km, in the F-layer. The green oxygen emissions are more spatially distributed. How sodium gets to mesospheric heights is not yet well understood, but it is believed to be a combination of upward transport of [[sea salt]] and [[meteor]]itic dust.

In daytime, sodium and red oxygen emissions are dominant and roughly 1,000 times as bright as nighttime emissions because in daytime, the upper atmosphere is fully exposed to solar UV radiation. The effect is however not noticeable to the human eye, since the glare of [[Rayleigh scattering|directly scattered]] sunlight outshines and obscures it.

==Indirect scattering of sunlight==
[[Image:Illuminated-arimass.png|250px|thumb|Amount of air still illuminated after sunset, at the horizon. Normalized so that zenith is 1 airmass]]
Indirectly scattered sunlight comes from two directions. From the atmosphere itself, and from outer space. In the first case, the sun has just set but still illuminates the upper atmosphere directly. Because the amount of scattered sunlight is proportional to the number of scatterers (i.e. air molecules) in the line of sight, the intensity of this light decreases rapidly as the sun drops further below the horizon and illuminates less of the atmosphere.

When the sun's altitude is &lt; -6° 99% of the atmosphere in [[zenith]] is in the Earth's shadow and second order scattering takes over. At the horizon, however, 35% of the atmosphere along the line of sight is still directly illuminated, and continues to be until the sun reaches -12°. From -12° to -18° only the uppermost parts of the atmosphere along the horizon, directly above the spot where the sun is, is still illuminated. After that, all direct illumination ceases and astronomical darkness sets in.

A second source sunlight is the [[zodiacal light]], which is caused by reflection and scattering of sunlight on interplanetary dust. Zodiacal light varies quite a lot in intensity depending on the position of the earth, location of the observer, time of year, and composition and distribution of the reflecting dust.

==Scattered light from extraterrestrial sources==
Not only sunlight is scattered by the molecules in the air. Starlight and the diffuse light of the milky way are also scattered by the air, and it is found that stars up to V magnitude 16 contribute to the diffuse scattered starlight.

Other sources such as galaxies and nebulae don't contribute significantly.

The total brightness of all the stars was first measured by Burns in 1899, with a calculated result that the total brightness reaching earth was equivalent to that of 2,000 first-magnitude stars &lt;ref&gt;Burns, G. J., "The total amount of starlight and the brightness of the sky," ''The Observatory, Vol. 33'', p. 123-129, March 1910; available at [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1910Obs....33..123B SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System] (retrieved 27 Nov. 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; with subsequent measurements by others.&lt;ref&gt;Yntema, L., "On the Brightness of the Sky and Total Amount of Starlight," ''Publications of the Kapteyn Astronomical Laboratory Groningen, vol. 22'', pp.1-55 (1909); available at [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1909PGro...22....1Y SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System] (retrieved 27 Nov. 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;
''

==Light pollution==
{{Main|Light pollution}}
Light pollution is an ever-increasing source of sky brightness in [[Urban area|urbanized area]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s. In densely populated areas that do not have stringent light pollution control, the entire night sky is regularly 5 to 50 times brighter than it would be if all lights were switched off, and very often the influence of light pollution is far greater than natural sources (including moonlight). With [[urbanization]] and light pollution, one third of humanity, and the majority of those in developed countries, cannot see the [[Milky Way]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/jun/10/milky-way-no-longer-visible-to-one-third-of-humanity-light-pollution|title=Milky Way no longer visible to one third of humanity, light pollution atlas shows|last=Davis|first=Nicola|date=2016-06-10|website=the Guardian|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Twilight==
When the sun has just set, the brightness of the sky decreases rapidly, thereby enabling us to see the airglow that is caused from such high altitudes that they are still fully sunlit until the sun drops more than about 12° below the horizon. During this time, yellow emissions from the sodium layer and red emissions from the 630&amp;nbsp;nm oxygen lines are dominant, and contribute to the purplish color sometimes seen during civil and nautical twilight.

After the sun has also set for these altitudes at the end of nautical twilight, the intensity of light emanating from earlier mentioned lines decreases, until the oxygen-green remains as the dominant source.

When astronomical darkness has set in, the green 557.7&amp;nbsp;nm oxygen line is dominant, and atmospheric scattering of starlight occurs.

Differential refraction causes different parts of the spectrum to dominate, producing a [[Golden hour (photography)|golden hour]] and a [[blue hour]].

==Relative contributions==
The following table gives the relative and absolute contributions to night sky brightness at zenith on a perfectly dark night at middle latitudes without moonlight and in the absence of any [[light pollution]].

(The S&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; unit is defined as the surface brightness of a star whose V-magnitude is 10 and whose light is smeared over one square degree, or 27.78 mag arcsec&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;.)

The total sky brightness in zenith is therefore ~220 S&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; or 21.9 mag/arcsec² in the V-band. Note that the contributions from Airglow and Zodiacal light vary with the time of year, the solar cycle, and the observer's latitude roughly as follows:

:&lt;math&gt; {\rm Airglow}/{\rm S}_{10} = 145+108(S-0.8)&lt;/math&gt;
where ''S'' is the solar 10.7&amp;nbsp;cm flux in MJy, and various sinusoidally between 0.8 and 2.0 with the 11-year solar cycle, yielding an upper contribution of ~270 S&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; at solar maximum.

The intensity of zodiacal light depends on the [[Ecliptic coordinate system|ecliptic latitude and longitude]] of the point in the sky being observed relative to that of the sun. At ecliptic longitudes differing from the sun's by &gt; 90 degrees, the relation is 
:&lt;math&gt; {\rm ZodiacalLight}/{\rm S}_{10} = 140 - 90\sin(|\beta|)&lt;/math&gt; 
where ''β'' is the ecliptic latitude and is smaller than 60°, when larger than 60 degrees the contribution is that given in the table. Along the ecliptic plane there are enhancements in the zodiacal light where it is much brighter near the sun and with a secondary maximum opposite the sun at 180 degrees longitude (the [[gegenschein]]).

In extreme cases natural zenith sky brightness can be as high as ~21.0 mag/arcsec², roughly twice as bright as nominal conditions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22297">Transcription Activator Like Effector Likes ('''TALE-likes''')  are a group of bacterial [[DNA-binding protein|DNA binding proteins]] named for the first and still best studied group, the [[TAL effector|TALEs]] of ''Xanthomonas'' bacteria. TALEs are important factors in the plant diseases caused by ''Xanthomonas'' bacteria, but are known primarily for their role in biotechnology as programmable DNA binding proteins, particularly in the context of [[Transcription activator-like effector nuclease|TALE nucleases]].  TALE-likes have additionally been found in many strains of the [[#RipTALs|''Ralstonia solanacearum'']] bacterial species complex, in  [[#Burkholderia TALE-likes|''Burkholderia rhizoxinica'' strain HKI 454]], and in [[#MOrTL1 and MOrTL2|two unknown marine bacteria]]. Whether or not all these proteins from a single phylogenetic grouping is as yet unclear.

The unifying feature of the TALE-likes are their tandem arrays of DNA binding repeats. These repeats are, with few exceptions, 33-35 amino acids in length, and composed of two alpha-helices on either side of a flexible loop containing the DNA base binding residues and with neighbouring repeats joined by flexible linker loops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deng|first1=Dong|last2=Yan|first2=Chuangye|last3=Wu|first3=Jianping|last4=Pan|first4=Xiaojing|last5=Yan|first5=Nieng|title=Revisiting the TALE repeat|journal=Protein &amp; Cell|date=14 March 2014|volume=5|issue=4|pages=297–306|doi=10.1007/s13238-014-0035-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence for this common structure comes in part from solved crystal structures of TALEs &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deng|first1=D.|last2=Yan|first2=C.|last3=Pan|first3=X.|last4=Mahfouz|first4=M.|last5=Wang|first5=J.|last6=Zhu|first6=J.-K.|last7=Shi|first7=Y.|last8=Yan|first8=N.|title=Structural Basis for Sequence-Specific Recognition of DNA by TAL Effectors|journal=Science|date=5 January 2012|volume=335|issue=6069|pages=720–723|doi=10.1126/science.1215670|pmid=22223738|pmc=3586824|bibcode=2012Sci...335..720D}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and a ''Burkholderia'' TALE-like,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stella|first1=Stefano|last2=Molina|first2=Rafael|last3=López-Méndez|first3=Blanca|last4=Juillerat|first4=Alexandre|last5=Bertonati|first5=Claudia|last6=Daboussi|first6=Fayza|last7=Campos-Olivas|first7=Ramon|last8=Duchateau|first8=Phillippe|last9=Montoya|first9=Guillermo|title=BuD, a helix–loop–helix DNA-binding domain for genome modification|journal=Acta Crystallographica Section D|date=29 June 2014|volume=70|issue=7|pages=2042–2052|doi=10.1107/S1399004714011183|pmid=25004980|pmc=4089491}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also from the conservation of the code that all TALE-likes use to recognise DNA-sequences.

== TALEs ==
[[TAL effector|TALEs]] are the first identified, best-studied and largest group within the TALE-likes. TALEs are found throughout the bacterial genus ''Xanthomonas'',&lt;ref name=Ferreira2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ferreira|first1=Rafael Marini|last2=de Oliveira|first2=Amanda Carolina P.|last3=Moreira|first3=Leandro M.|last4=Belasque|first4=José|last5=Gourbeyre|first5=Edith|last6=Siguier|first6=Patricia|last7=Ferro|first7=Maria Inês T.|last8=Ferro|first8=Jesus A.|last9=Chandler|first9=Michael|last10=Varani|first10=Alessandro M.|title=A TALE of Transposition: Tn-Like Transposons Play a Major Role in the Spread of Pathogenicity Determinants of Xanthomonas citri and Other Xanthomonads|journal=mBio|date=17 February 2015|volume=6|issue=1|pages=e02505-14|doi=10.1128/mBio.02505-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; comprising mostly plant pathogens. Those TALEs which have been studied have all been shown to be secreted as part of the Type III secretion system into host plant cells. Once inside the host cell they translocate to the nucleus, bind specific DNA sequences within host promoters and turn on downstream genes. Every part of this process is thought to be conserved across all TALEs. The single meaningful difference between individual TALEs, based on current understanding, is the specific DNA sequence that each TALE binds. TALEs from even closely related strains differ in the composition of repeats that make up their DNA binding domain.&lt;ref name=PerezQunitero2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pérez-Quintero|first1=Alvaro L.|last2=Lamy|first2=Léo|last3=Gordon|first3=Jonathan L.|last4=Escalon|first4=Aline|last5=Cunnac|first5=Sébastien|last6=Szurek|first6=Boris|last7=Gagnevin|first7=Lionel|title=QueTAL: a suite of tools to classify and compare TAL effectors functionally and phylogenetically|journal=Frontiers in Plant Science|date=3 August 2015|volume=6|doi=10.3389/fpls.2015.00545}}&lt;/ref&gt; Repeat composition determines DNA binding preference. In particular position 13 of each repeat confers the DNA base preference of each repeat. During early research it was noted that almost all the differences between repeats of a single TALE repeat array are found in positions 12 and 13 and this finding led to the hypothesis that these residues determine base preference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boch|first1=Jens|last2=Schornack|first2=Sebastian|title=Unraveling a 20-Year Enigma|journal=IS-MPMI reporter|date=2010|issue=1|pages=3–4|url=http://www.ismpmi.org/members/IS-MPMI-Reporter/Documents/Archives/1001.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact repeat positions 12 and 13, referred to jointly as the Repeat Variable Diresidue (RVD) are commonly said to confer base specificity despite clear evidence that position 13 is the base determining residue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Lange|first1=Orlando|last2=Binder|first2=Andreas|last3=Lahaye|first3=Thomas|title=From dead leaf, to new life: TAL effectors as tools for synthetic biology|journal=The Plant Journal|date=June 2014|volume=78|issue=5|pages=753–771|doi=10.1111/tpj.12431}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the repeat domain TALEs  also possess a number of conserved features in the domains flanking the repeats. These include domains for type-III-secretion, nuclear localization and transcriptional activation. This allows TALEs to carry out their biological role as effector proteins secreted into host plant cells to activate expression of specific host genes.

'''Diversity and evolution'''

Whilst the RVD positions are commonly the only variable positions within a single TALE repeat array it should be noted that there are more differences when comparing repeat arrays of different TALEs. The diversity of TALEs across the Xanthomonas genus is considerable, but a particularly striking finding is that the evolutionary history one arrives at by comparing repeat compositions differs from that found when comparing non-repeat sequences.&lt;ref name=PerezQunitero2015/&gt; Repeat arrays of TALEs are thought to evolve rapidly, with a number of recombinatorial processes suggested to shape repeat array evolution.&lt;ref name=Ferreira2015/&gt; Recombination of TALE repeat arrays has been demonstrated in a forced-selection experiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yang|first1=Bing|last2=Sugio|first2=Akiko|last3=White|first3=Frank F.|title=Avoidance of Host Recognition by Alterations in the Repetitive and C-Terminal Regions of AvrXa7, a Type III Effector of                            pv.|journal=Molecular Plant-Microbe Interactions|date=February 2005|volume=18|issue=2|pages=142–149|doi=10.1094/MPMI-18-0142}}&lt;/ref&gt; This evolutionary dynamism is though to be made possible by the very high sequence identity of TALE repeats, which is a unique feature of TALEs as opposed to other TALE-likes.

'''T-zero'''

Another unique feature of TALEs is a set of four repeat structures at the N-terminal flank of the core repeat array. These structures, termed non-canonical or degenerate repeats have been shown to be vital for DNA binding,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gao|first1=Haishan|last2=Wu|first2=Xiaojing|last3=Chai|first3=Jijie|last4=Han|first4=Zhifu|title=Crystal structure of a TALE protein reveals an extended N-terminal DNA binding region|journal=Cell Research|date=13 November 2012|volume=22|issue=12|pages=1716–1720|doi=10.1038/cr.2012.156|pmc=3515758}}&lt;/ref&gt; though all but one do not contact DNA bases and thus make no contribution to sequence preference. The one exception is repeat -1, which encodes a fixed T-zero preference to all TALEs. This means that the target sequences of TALEs are always preceded by a thymine base. This is thought to be common to all TALEs, with the possible exception of TalC from ''Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae'' strain AXO1947.

'''Discovery and molecular properties'''

It was noted in the 2002 publication of the genome of reference strain ''[[Ralstonia solanacearum]]'' GMI1000 that its genome encodes a protein similar to ''Xanthomonas'' TALEs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Salanoubat|first1=M.|last2=Genin|first2=S.|last3=Artiguenave|first3=F.|last4=Gouzy|first4=J.|last5=Mangenot|first5=S.|last6=Arlat|first6=M.|last7=Billault|first7=A.|last8=Brottier|first8=P.|last9=Camus|first9=J.

'''Biological role'''

Several lines of evidence support the idea that RipTALs function as effector proteins, promoting bacterial growth or disease by manipulating the expression of plant genes. They are secreted into plant cells by the [[Type three secretion system|Type III secretion system]], which is the main delivery system for effector proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mukaihara|first1=Takafumi|last2=Tamura|first2=Naoyuki|last3=Iwabuchi|first3=Masaki|title=Genome-Wide Identification of a Large Repertoire of Ralstonia solanacearum Type III Effector Proteins by a New Functional Screen|journal=Molecular Plant-Microbe Interactions|volume=23|issue=3|pages=251–262|doi=10.1094/mpmi-23-3-0251|url=http://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/pdf/10.1094/MPMI-23-3-0251}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are able to function as sequence-specific transcription factors in plant cells.&lt;ref name=deLange2013/&gt; In addition a strain lacking its RipTAL was shown to grow slower inside eggplant leaf tissue than the wild type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Macho|first1=Alberto P.|last2=Guidot|first2=Alice|last3=Barberis|first3=Patrick|last4=Beuzón|first4=Carmen R.|last5=Genin|first5=Stéphane|title=A Competitive Index Assay Identifies Several                            Type III Effector Mutant Strains with Reduced Fitness in Host Plants|journal=Molecular Plant-Microbe Interactions|date=September 2010|volume=23|issue=9|pages=1197–1205|doi=10.1094/MPMI-23-9-1197|url=https://zenodo.org/record/853028}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, a study based on DNA polymorphisms in ''ripTAL'' repeat domain sequences and host plants found a statistically significant connection between host plant and repeat domain variants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heuer|first1=H.|last2=Yin|first2=Y.-N.|last3=Xue|first3=Q.-Y.|last4=Smalla|first4=K.|last5=Guo|first5=J.-H.|title=Repeat Domain Diversity of avrBs3-Like Genes in Ralstonia solanacearum Strains and Association with Host Preferences in the Field|journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology|date=27 April 2007|volume=73|issue=13|pages=4379–4384|doi=10.1128/AEM.00367-07|pmid=17468277|pmc=1932761}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is expected if the RipTALs of different strains are adapted to target genes in specific host plants. Despite this to date no target genes have been identified for any RipTAL.

== ''Burkholderia'' TALE-likes ==
'''Discovery'''

The publication of the genome of bacterial strain [[Burkholderia rhizoxinica|''Bukrholderia rhizoxinica'']] HKI 454, in 2011 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lackner|first1=Gerald|last2=Moebius|first2=Nadine|last3=Partida-Martinez|first3=Laila P|last4=Boland|first4=Sebastian|last5=Hertweck|first5=Christian|title=Evolution of an endofungal Lifestyle: Deductions from the Burkholderia rhizoxinica Genome|journal=BMC Genomics|date=2011|volume=12|issue=1|pages=210|doi=10.1186/1471-2164-12-210|pmid=21539752|pmc=3102044}}&lt;/ref&gt; led to the discovery of a set of TALE-like genes that differed considerably in nature from the TALEs and RipTALS. The proteins encoded by these genes were studied for their DNA binding properties by two groups independently and named the Bats (Burkholderia TALE-likes &lt;ref name=Batpaper2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Lange|first1=Orlando|last2=Wolf|first2=Christina|last3=Dietze|first3=Joern|last4=Elsaesser|first4=Janett|last5=Morbitzer|first5=Robert|last6=Lahaye|first6=Thomas|title=Programmable DNA-binding proteins from Burkholderia provide a fresh perspective on the TALE-like repeat domain|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|date=3 May 2014|volume=42|issue=11|pages=7436–7449|doi=10.1093/nar/gku329|pmid=24792163|pmc=4066763}}&lt;/ref&gt;) or BurrH.&lt;ref name=Juillerat2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Juillerat|first1=Alexandre|last2=Bertonati|first2=Claudia|last3=Dubois|first3=Gwendoline|last4=Guyot|first4=Valérie|last5=Thomas|first5=Séverine|last6=Valton|first6=Julien|last7=Beurdeley|first7=Marine|last8=Silva|first8=George H.|last9=Daboussi|first9=Fayza|last10=Duchateau|first10=Philippe|title=BurrH: a new modular DNA binding protein for genome engineering|journal=Scientific Reports|date=23 January 2014|volume=4|doi=10.1038/srep03831|bibcode=2014NatSR...4E3831J}}&lt;/ref&gt; This research showed that the repeat units of the ''Burkholderia'' TALE-likes bind DNA with the same code as TALEs, governed by position 13 of each repeat. There are, however, a number of differences.

'''Biological role'''

''Burkholderia'' TALE-likes are composed almost entirely of repeats, lacking the large non-repetitive domains found flanking the repeats in TALEs and RpTALs. Those domains are key to the functions of TALEs and RipTALs allowing them to infiltrate the plant nucleus and turn on gene expression.  It is therefore currently unclear what the biological roles of ''Burkholderia'' TALE-likes are. What is clear is that they are not effector proteins secreted into plant cells to act as transcription factors, the biological role of TALEs and RipTALs. It is not unexpected that they may differ in biological roles from TALEs and RipTALs since the life style of the bacterium they derive from is very unlike that of TALE and RipTAL bearing bacteria. ''B. rhizoxinica'' is an endosymbiont, living inside a fungus, ''Rhizopus microsporus'', a plant pathogen. The same fungus is also an opportunistic human pathogen in immuno-compromised patients, but whereas ''B. rhizoxinica'' is necessary for pathogenicity on plant hosts it is irrelevant to human infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Partida-Martinez|first1=Laila P.|last2=Bandemer|first2=Sabine|last3=Rüchel|first3=Reinhard|last4=Dannaoui|first4=Eric|last5=Hertweck|first5=Christian|title=Lack of evidence of endosymbiotic toxin-producing bacteria in clinical Rhizopus isolates|journal=Mycoses|date=May 2008|volume=51|issue=3|pages=266–269|doi=10.1111/j.1439-0507.2007.01477.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is unclear whether the ''Burkholderia'' TALE-likes are ever secreted either into the fungus, let alone into host plants.
 
'''Uses in Biotechnology'''

As noted in the publications on ''Burkholderia'' TALE-likes there may be some advantages to using these proteins as a scaffold for programmable DNA-binding proteins to function as transcription factors or designer-nucleases, compared to TALEs.&lt;ref name="Batpaper2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Juillerat2014" /&gt; These advantages are a shorter repeat size, more compact domain structure (no large non-repeat domains), greater repeat sequence diversity enabling the use of PCR on the genes encoding them and making them less vulnerable  to recombinatorial repeat loss. In addition Burkholderia TALE-likes have no T-zero requirement relaxing the constraints on DNA target selection. However, to  uses of Burkholderia TALE-likes as programmable DNA binding proteins have been published, outside of the original characterization publications.

In 2007 the results of a sweep of the world's oceans by the [[J.

The proteins encoded by these DNA sequences were therefore designated Marine Organism TALE-likes (MOrTLs) 1 and 2.

'''Evolutionary relationship to other TALE-likes'''

Whilst repeats of MOrTL1 and 2 both conform structurally and functionally to the TALE-like norm, they differ considerably at the sequence level both from all other TALE-likes and from one another. It is not known whether they are truly homologous to the other TALE-likes, and thus constitute together with the TALEs, RipTALs and Bats a true [[Protein family|protein-family]]. Alternatively they may have evolved independently. It is particularly difficult to judge the relationship to the other TALE-likes because almost nothing is known of the organisms that MOrTL1 and MOrTL2 come from. It is known only that they were found in two separate sea-water samples from the Gulf of Mexico and are likely to be bacteria based on size-exclusion before DNA sequencing.&lt;ref name=MOrTLspaper2014/&gt;

'''''The Evolution of God''''' is a 2009 book by [[Robert Wright (journalist)|Robert Wright]], in which the author explores the history of the concept of [[God]] in the three [[Abrahamic religions]] through a variety of means, including [[archeology]], history, [[theology]], and [[evolutionary psychology]]. The patterns which link [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]] and the ways in which they have changed their concepts over time are explored as one of the central themes.

One of the conclusions of the book that Wright tries to make is a reconciliation [[Relationship between religion and science|between science and religion]].  He also speculates on the future of the concept of God.

==Evolutionary biology==
Among other things, Wright discusses the role of [[evolutionary biology]] in the development of religion. Geneticist [[Dean Hamer]] hypothesized that some people have a specific gene that makes them prone to religious belief, which he calls the [[God gene]], and that over time natural selection has favored these people because their spirituality leads to optimism. Wright, however, thinks the tendency towards religious belief is not an adaptive trait influenced by natural selection, but rather a [[Spandrel (biology)|spandrel]] - a trait that happens to be supported by adaptations originally selected for other purposes. Wright states that the human brain approaches religious belief based on how it adapted to survive and reproduce in early hunter-gatherer societies.

He points out four key traits of religion that align with the human brain's survival adaptations:
*Its claims can be surprising, strange, and even counterintuitive.
*It claims to show what causes good and bad things to happen.
*It tells people that they can control these causes and increase the ratio of good to bad results.
*It is hard to falsify or disprove.
Humans have adapted to pay attention to surprising and confusing information, because it could make the difference between life and death. (For instance, if a person left the campsite and mysteriously never returned, it would be wise for the others to be on guard for a predator or some other danger.) Understanding and controlling cause and effect also takes top priority in the human brain, since humans live in complex social groups where predicting and influencing the actions and thoughts of others gains them allies, status, and access to resources. As human cognitive abilities and curiosity expanded over the centuries, their investigation of cause and effect expanded from the strictly social context out into the world at large, opening the doors for religions to explain things like weather and disease.

Though some of these explanations were strange and perhaps dubious, the fact that they could not be completely disproven lent them credibility; it was better to be cautious than dead. Wright uses an example from the [[Haida people]], indigenous to the northwest coast of North America, who would try to appease killer whale deities to calm storms out at sea; they would pour fresh water into the ocean or tie tobacco or deer tallow to the end of a paddle. While some people certainly died despite these offerings, those who survived were a testament to the ritual's possible efficacy.

Mysterious and unproven beliefs can also persist in a culture because human brains have adapted to agree with the group consensus even if it goes against one's better judgment or personal beliefs, since a person alienated from the group loses protection, food, and mates. Wright cites the [[Asch conformity experiments]] and even posits that [[Stockholm syndrome]] is not so much a syndrome as a natural product of evolution, the brain's way of ensuring that a person accepts and is accepted by his or her new social group. In addition, beliefs can persist because once a person publicly announces a belief, social psychologists have found that he or she is inclined to focus on evidence supporting that belief while conveniently ignoring evidence contradicting it, a logical fallacy known as [[Cherry picking (fallacy)|cherry picking]].

==Reviews==
Journalist and political commentator [[Andrew Sullivan]] gave the book a positive review in ''[[The Atlantic]]'', saying that the book "...gave me hope that we can avoid both the barrenness of a world without God and the horrible fusion of fundamentalism and weapons of mass destruction." &lt;ref&gt;[http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2009/05/the-evolution-of-god.html Andrew Sullivan's blog post linking to his review], from ''[[The Atlantic]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/andrew_sullivan/article6255785.ece Sullivan's full review of the book] from ''[[The Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Newsweek]]'' religion editor, [[Lisa Miller (journalist)|Lisa Miller]], described ''The Evolution of God'' as a reframing of the [[faith]] vs. reason debate. Drawing a contrast to such authors as [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]], [[Richard Dawkins]] and [[Christopher Hitchens]], Miller gives an overall positive review of the book's approach to the examination of the concept of God.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsweek.com/id/199697 Let’s Talk About God] from ''[[Newsweek]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review for ''[[The New York Times]]'', Yale professor of psychology [[Paul Bloom (professor)|Paul Bloom]] said, "In his brilliant new book, “The Evolution of God,” Robert Wright tells the story of how God grew up."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/28/books/review/Bloom-t.html?_r=1 Review of ''The Evolution of God''] from ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;  Bloom sums up Wright's controversial stance as, "Wright’s tone is reasoned and careful, even hesitant, throughout, and it is nice to read about issues like the morality of Christ and the meaning of jihad without getting the feeling that you are being shouted at. His views, though, are provocative and controversial. There is something here to annoy almost everyone."

However, in a ''New York Times'' review that included a reply from Wright, [[Nicholas Wade]], a writer for the "Science Times" section, notes the book is "a disappointment from the Darwinian perspective", because evolution "provides a simpler explanation for moral progression than the deity Wright half invokes."&lt;ref&gt;[http://tierneylab.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/02/the-non-evolution-of-god/ The Non-Evolution of God], a July 2009 blog post from the ''New York Times'' website&lt;/ref&gt; Wright replied to Wade's comments, saying Wade had misunderstood Wright's argument and that "The deity (if there is one–and I’m agnostic on that point) would be realizing moral progress through evolution’s creation of the human moral sense (and through the subsequent development of that moral sense via cultural evolution, particularly technological evolution)."&lt;ref name="nyteog2"&gt;[http://tierneylab.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/10/non-evolution-of-god-part-2/ Non-Evolution of God, Part 2], a July 2009 blog post from the ''New York Times'' website&lt;/ref&gt;  Wade replied that "evolution seems to me a sufficient explanation for the moral progress that Mr. Wright correctly discerns in the human condition, so there seemed no compelling need to invoke a deity."&lt;ref name="nyteog2"/&gt;

'''The Seven Pillars of Life''' are the essential principles of [[life]] described by [[Daniel E. Koshland, Jr.|Daniel E. Koshland]] in 2002 in order to create a universal definition of life.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.usatoday.com/news/science/biology/2002-03-29-life-pillars.htm&lt;/ref&gt; One stated goal of this universal definition is to aid in understanding and identifying [[artificial life|artificial]] and [[extraterrestrial life]].&lt;ref&gt;Koshland D. E. Jr (2002). The Seven Pillars of Life. Science, 295: 2215-2216&lt;/ref&gt; The seven pillars are Program, Improvisation, Compartmentalization, Energy, Regeneration, Adaptability, and Seclusion. These can be abbreviated as PICERAS.

== The Seven Pillars ==

=== Program ===
Koshland defines "Program" as an "organized plan that describes both the ingredients themselves and the kinetics of the interactions among ingredients as the living system persists through time."&lt;ref&gt;Koshland D. E. Jr (2002). The Seven Pillars of Life. Science, 295: 2215-2216&lt;/ref&gt; In natural life as it is known on Earth, the program operates through the mechanisms of [[nucleic acids]] and [[amino acids]], but the concept of program can apply to other imagined or undiscovered mechanisms.

=== Improvisation ===
"Improvisation" refers to the living system's ability to change its program in response to the larger [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]] in which it exists. An example of improvisation on earth is [[natural selection]].

=== Compartmentalization ===
"Compartmentalization" refers to the separation of spaces in the living system that allow for separate environments for necessary chemical processes. Compartmentalization is necessary to protect the concentration of the ingredients for a reaction from outside environments.

=== Energy ===
Because living systems involve net movement in terms of chemical movement or body movement, and lose energy in those movements through [[entropy]], [[energy]] is required for a living system to exist. The main source of energy on Earth is the sun, but other sources of energy exist for life on Earth, such as hydrogen gas or methane, used in [[chemosynthesis]].

=== Regeneration ===
"Regeneration" in a living system refers to the general compensation for losses and degradation in the various components and processes in the system. This covers the thermodynamic loss in chemical reactions, the wear and tear of larger parts, and the larger decline of components of the system in [[ageing]]. Living systems replace these losses by importing molecules from the outside environment, synthesizing new molecules and components, or creating new generations to start the system over again.

=== Adaptability ===
"Adaptability" is the ability of a living system to respond to needs, dangers, or changes. It is distinguished from improvisation because the response is timely and does not involve a change of the program. Adaptability occurs from a molecular level to a behavioral level through [[feedback]] and [[Feedforward neural network|feedforward]] systems. For example, an animal seeing a predator will respond to the danger with hormonal changes and escape behavior.

=== Seclusion ===

== Criticism ==
Y. N. Zhuravlev and V. A. Avetisov have analyzed Koshland's seven pillars from the context of [[primordial life]] and, though calling the concept "elegant," point out that the pillars of compartmentalization, program, and seclusion don't apply well to the non-differentiated earliest life.&lt;ref&gt;Zhuravlev, Y. N. and V. A. Avetisov."The definition of life in the context of its origin"''[[Biogeosciences]]'', 2006-07-10. Retrieved on 2008-08-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Time and Eternity - An Essay on the Philosophy of Religion''''' (1st imp. [[Princeton University|Princeton]] [[New Jersey]] 1952, [[Princeton University Press]], 169 pp) is a philosophy book written by [[Walter Terence Stace]]. At the time of writing, Stace was a professor of philosophy at [[Princeton University]], where he had worked since 1932 after a 22-year career in the [[Ceylon Civil Service]]. ''Time and Eternity'' was one of his first books about the [[philosophy of religion]] and [[mysticism]], after writing throughout most of the 1930s and 1940s that was influenced by [[Phenomenalism|phenomenalist]] philosophy.

In his introduction Stace writes that ''Time and Eternity'' is an attempt to set out the fundamental nature of religion, and to deal with the conflict between religion and [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]]. He explains that the basic idea set out in the book is that all religious thought is symbolic, and that his influences include [[Rudolf Otto]], especially his ''Mysticism East and West'', and [[Immanuel Kant]]. He says he was motivated to write the book in an attempt to add to the "other half of the truth which I now think naturalism [as espoused in his 1947 essay ''Man Against Darkness''] misses".

The book begins by looking at religion, specifically God as non-being and as being, put by Stace as the negative and positive divine. Stace then defines two orders of being - time and eternity, which he says intersect in the moment of mystic illumination. He goes on to say that the nature of God or eternity is such that all religious language is symbolic and that it is necessarily subject to contradictions.

==Synopsis==

The first chapter asks what religion is, stating that religious thought is contradictory, is rooted in [[intuition (philosophy)|intuition]], and that God is fundamentally a mystery. The second and third chapters look at the [[Apophatic theology|negative divine]] - the characterisation of God as void, silence or non-being - which Stace maintains is an idea found in all religions. He maintains that mystical experience is shared by all mankind, it is only the theories about it that differ.&lt;ref&gt;Stace, W. T. (1952) ''Time and Eternity''.  [[Princeton University Press]]. P. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; On this point he says he is in agreement with Otto. In this experience the distinction between subject and object is overcome, indeed there is no difference between the experiencer and the experience.

| style="text-align: left;" | "It is not that the mystic has an experience, even a direct vision, of God. For in that case God would be the object for the soul as subject. The distinction between God and the soul, as object and subject respectively, is wholly done away with. The soul passes into the being of God, becomes God, is God."
|-
| style="text-align: left;" | &lt;ref&gt;Stace (1952) P. 23&lt;/ref&gt;
|}

Stace then goes on to explain that all religions say that religious revelation is [[ineffability|ineffable]], because no words or concepts can be applied to God who is without qualities or predicates. Thus, God cannot be comprehended by the intellect, but is apprehended by intuition. "... it is of the very nature of intellect to involve the subject-object opposition. But in the mystic experience this opposition is transcended. Therefore the intellect is incapable of understanding it. Therefore it is incomprehensible, ineffable."&lt;ref&gt;Stace (1952) P. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

Stace then looks at the [[Cataphatic theology|positive divine]]; he asks how concepts can be applied to that which is above all concepts and finds that all propositions about God are symbolical. He defines religious and non-religious symbolism as differing in two respects. Firstly, religious symbols cannot be translated into logical propositions because they refer to an (ineffable) experience rather than a proposition. Secondly, the relationship between the religious symbol and what is symbolised is one of evocation rather than "meaning", as meaning is a concept, which is absent in the mystical experience. "Yet in some way this symbolic language evokes in us some glimpse, some hint, seen dimly through the mists and fogs which envelop us, of that being who stands above all human thought and conception."&lt;ref&gt;Stace (1952) P. 51&lt;/ref&gt; He goes on to write that some of these symbols feel more appropriate than others (e.g. God is love not hate).

[[File:Plotinos.jpg|thumb|200px|"Thus when Plotinus speaks of "the flight of the alone to the Alone,"… [this] evoke[s] in us a measure of the same experience which the author of them had."&lt;ref&gt;Stace (1952) P. 91&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Next Stace explains that there are two orders of being: time (or the world) and eternity (or God), and these intersect in the moment of mystic illumination. He maintains these orders are distinct, so one order cannot dictate to the other. Here he says that he agrees with Kant, who made a distinction between the world of [[phenomenon|phenomena]] and the [[noumenon]], although he is critical of Kant’s disregard for mystical experience.&lt;ref&gt;Stace (1952) P. 148&lt;/ref&gt;

Looking at symbolism in religion, Stace states that there are two types of predicates applied to God: first, the ethically-neutral sort, such as God being mind, power or personhood. Secondly, the ethical kind, where he is love, mercy, or righteousness. He explains that the former qualities are justified by an appeal to a [[hierarchy of being]], and the latter to a hierarchy of value. In both cases the more adequate symbol are those that are higher in each hierarchy. In rooting symbolism in hierarchies, Stace explicitly states he is in opposition to Otto who thought religious symbolism was based on analogy between the [[numinous|numen]] and qualities found in the natural world.&lt;ref&gt;Stace (1952) P. 94-95&lt;/ref&gt;

Stace next looks at religion’s claims to truth. He draws an analogy between mystical illumination and aesthetic truth, as the truths of both rest on revelation rather than reason. "Either you directly perceive beauty, or you do not. And either you directly perceive God in intuition, or you do not."&lt;ref&gt;Stace (1952) P. 142&lt;/ref&gt; Further, he maintains the arguments of both mystics and naturalists in denying each other’s positions are invalid, as they concern different realities.

{| class="toccolours" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;" cellspacing="5"
| style="text-align: left;" | "What is the meaning of the metaphor of intersection? This intersection means precisely what the eternal moment is experienced to be. It is one and the same human consciousness which experiences both the temporal or natural world and that eternal and infinite order which is disclosed in mystical illumination."
|-
| style="text-align: left;" | &lt;ref&gt;Stace (1952) P. 82&lt;/ref&gt;
|}

These separate spheres lead Stace to reflect on both [[Existence of God#Arguments for the existence of God|proofs for God]] and [[acosmism]]. He writes that proofs and disproofs for God are equally false, as God is only accessible by intuition and not logic. "… the production by philosophers of proofs of the unreality of space, time, and the temporal world generally, is a direct result of their mistaking of their mystical propositions for factual propositions." &lt;ref&gt;Stace (1952) P. 134&lt;/ref&gt; Further, proofs of God actually harm religion as they make him a part of the natural order - a point on which he says that he agrees with Kant.&lt;ref&gt;Stace (1952) P. 147-8&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely acosmism (the denial of the reality of the world) has its root in the mystical moment, within which there is no other truth, God is the supreme reality and there is no naturalistic world. However this is a symbolic truth, rather than a statement of fact. Its counterpart in naturalism is atheism, which denies the reality of God.

{| class="toccolours" style="float: left; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;" cellspacing="5"
| style="text-align: left;" | "The pure religious consciousness lies in a region which is forever beyond all proof or disproof. This is a necessary consequence of the "utterly other" character of God from the world, and of the "utterly other" character of the world from God. The eternal order is not the natural order, and the natural order is not the eternal order. The two orders intersect, but in the intersection each remains what it is. Each is wholly self-contained. Therefore, it is impossible to pass, by any logical inference, from one to the other. This at once precludes as impossible any talk either of the proof or disproof of religion."
|-
| style="text-align: left;" | &lt;ref&gt;Stace (1952) P. 136&lt;/ref&gt;
|}

In the final chapter Stace looks at mysticism and logic. He returns to the idea that theology and mystical philosophies (he gives the examples of [[Vedanta]], [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], and [[F. H. Bradley|Bradley]]) will always contain contradictions. Known as the doctrine of the Mystery of God, he maintains this is because the intellect is inherently incapable of understanding the Ultimate. All attempts to state the nature of the ultimate necessarily produce contradictions.

[[File:Ikone Athanasius von Alexandria.jpg|thumb|200px|“[[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad|The Upanishad]] says flatly that Brahman "is incomprehensible, for it cannot be comprehended". [[Creed of St. Athanasius|The creed of St. Athanasius]] agrees with the Upanishad: 
'The Father incomprehensible, the Son incomprehensible, 
the Holy Ghost incomprehensible. . . . 
Yet not three incomprehensibles, but one incomprehensible.'"&lt;ref&gt;Stace (1952) P. 37&lt;/ref&gt;]]

==Critical response==

[[Virgil Aldrich|Virgil C Aldrich]] reviewed the book alongside ''Religion and the Modern Mind'' and ''The Gate of Silence'', also by Stace and published in 1952. He points out that all three books mark a new direction for Stace who was previously best known as an empiricist and naturalist. For Aldrich this new intellectual interest results in a sharp dualism in both Stace’s personality and his thought. However, he writes that fortunately Stace’s philosophical background prevents him from supposing that scientific empiricism can confirm religious experience, indeed his religious philosophy is the sort “that a [[David Hume|Hume]] or a Kant can consort with.” Aldrich argues that Stace’s intellectual sophistication is most evident in his ideas about the negative divine, but his thought is liable to all the standard objections where he proposes notions of the positive divine and religious intuition. Specifically, the notion that religious language is evocative of the mystical experience is problematic, because it is difficult to determine what language is adequate without resorting to literal or abstract ideas. Rudolf Otto’s notion of analogy, rejected by Stace, is more robust. Aldrich points out a contradiction in Stace’s reliance on hierarchies of being and values to more adequately refer to God, as this implies continuity between the world and eternity, which Stace denies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Virgil Aldrich|Aldrich, Virgil C.]] (Jan. 21, 1954). "Book Reviews", ''[[The Journal of Philosophy]]'', 51(2), 75-77&lt;/ref&gt;

[[J. Seelye Bixler|Julius Seelye Bixler]] reviewed the book twice, in 1952 and 1953. In his first review he wrote that he believed Stace was trying to have his cake and eat it with regards to the truth of both naturalism and mysticism. Bixler also wonders whether the revelation of God can really be free of concepts and thus whether time and eternity are utterly unrelated as Stace maintains. He identifies points in Stace’s thought where there is continuity between these two states and mystical language does appear to refer to concepts. Finally he rejects the book’s analogy of mystical experience to the evocative power of art, maintaining that art must be somewhat related to logic. Nonetheless, Bixler does concur that the book is a fascinating confessio fidei and personal statement.&lt;ref&gt;[[J. Seelye Bixler|Bixler, J.S.]] (Oct., 1952). "Book Reviews", ''[[Journal of the American Academy of Religion|The Journal of Bible and Religion]]'', 20(4), 272-274, OUP.&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, he reviewed ''Time and Eternity'' alongside ''Religion and the Modern Mind''. As well as reiterating the points he had made earlier, Bixler judges the second book more favourably and recommends reading the two together to better understand the problems they address.&lt;ref&gt;[[J. Seelye Bixler|Bixler, J.S.]] (Jul 1953). "Reviews of Books", ''[[The Philosophical Review]]'', 62(3), 479-480.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stace was praised for his clarity and ambitious aims in ''Time and Eternity'' by [[Abraham Kaplan]] who believed the book was one of the best on the subject for many many years. He pointed out that the book’s distinction between the orders of time and eternity owed much to Kant (which Stace himself acknowledged). Kaplan reflected that it was the book’s emphasis placed on mysticism and a universal religious intuition that would be of particular interest to students of “Oriental and comparative philosophy”. The central idea upon which Stace’s thought stands or falls, for Kaplan, is that religious language is evocative rather than descriptive. In this both religionists and naturalists will find problems. For the former, Stace can only account for the appropriateness of religious language by relying on ‘nearness’ to the divine rather than on resemblance, and this relies on ‘a vague panpsychism’ and levels of being in the manner of [[Samuel Alexander]]. While for the naturalist, Stace’s system of religious symbolism is doomed to remain mysterious, because it does not allow religious metaphors to be translated literally and neither can it be said how they evoke the experience to which they refer.&lt;ref&gt;[[Abraham Kaplan|Kaplan, Abraham]] (Oct 1953). "Book Reviews", ''[[Philosophy East and West]]'', 3(3), 1953, 275-276.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also noting the unachievable ambition of solving the conflict between naturalism and religion, Martin A Greenman, remarks that one must come to the book “with a certain mood”. Too critical a mood would blind the reader to its religious insights, while the sensitivity and depth of its philosophic insights would be lost if one were to approach it in a too enthusiastically religious mood. Greenman finishes by justifying Stace’s philosophy to logical positivists by quoting from [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]]'s [[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus|''Tractatus'']]: “My propositions are elucidatory in this way: he who understands me finally recognizes them as senseless, when he has climbed out through them, on them, over them….He must surmount these propositions: then he sees the world rightly” (6. 54.)&lt;ref&gt;Greenman, Martin A. (Mar. 1953). "Reviews", ''[[Philosophy and Phenomenological Research]]'',13(3), 416-417.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dorothy M. Emmet]] found issue with the notion that the mystical experience is the point of intersection between the temporal and eternal orders. She writes that there are difficulties in Stace defining these orders as two distinct “orders of being”, rather than just as a way of speaking, because this then means some statements about the temporal order are relevant to what is said about the eternal order and vice versa. Indeed, the interrelation between these two orders is difficult to maintain. She also questioned Stace’s characterisation of mystical consciousness as being the same everywhere.&lt;ref&gt;[[Emmet, Dorothy, M.]] (Jan 1954). "New Books", ''[[Philosophy (journal)|Philosophy]]'', 29(108), 77-78&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, Maurice Friedman writes about the book in the context of the various attempts to find a universal essence - or [[perennial philosophy]] - within religion. He finds that ''Time and Eternity'' is a more systematic attempt at this than those proposed by [[Aldous Huxley]] or [[Ananda Coomaraswamy]], but no more successful. For Friedman, the philosophy that Stace lays out in the book is derived from metaphysical speculation (that, like the ideas of Huxley and Coomaraswamy, is influenced by Vedanta), rather than mystical experience. Central to Friedman’s critique is the notion that there is a vast gulf between the mystical experience which Stace defines as beyond thought, and his philosophical system built on this. He also mentions that mystics do not always agree on what experiences, symbols and philosophies are the closest to the divine.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Maurice. (2012) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=hnWXeuZN2MoC&amp;pg=PA99&amp;lpg=PA99 A Heart of Wisdom: Religion and Human Wholeness]'' [[SUNY Press]]. pp. 98-100. {{ISBN|9781438403366}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book has received more positive support however. [[Robert Cummings Neville|Robert C Neville]] called ''Time and Eternity'' “the most sophisticated treatment of eternity and time in our century so far”.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Cummings Neville|Neville, Robert Cummings]]. (1993). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=bqUYCRhDooAC&amp;pg=PA236&amp;lpg=PA236 Eternity and Time's Flow]'', [[SUNY Press]]. pp. 236-237. {{ISBN|9780791415993}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Thought: [[A Very Short Introduction]]'', Tim Bayne says the book contains a “classic” discussion of ineffability.&lt;ref&gt;Bayne, Tim. (2013). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=jXIo9QLwjh4C&amp;pg=PA121&amp;lpg=PA121 Thought: A Very Short Introduction]'' Oxford University Press. p. 121. {{ISBN|9780199601721}}&lt;/ref&gt; American writer Arthur Goldwag has said that the phrase "that than which there is no other" that he encountered in ''Time and Eternity'' was one of a number of factors that contributed to him giving up praying.&lt;ref&gt;Goldwag, Arthur (October 9, 2009) [http://killingthebuddha.com/mag/confession/why-i-dont-pray/ ''Confession: Why I Don't Pray'']. Killing the Buddha magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

The trabecular cartilages generally appear as a paired, rod-shaped cartilages at the ventral side of the [[forebrain]] and lateral side of the [[adenohypophysis]] in the vertebrate embryo. During development, their anterior ends fuse and form the ''trabecula communis''. Their posterior ends fuse with the caudal-most [[parachordal cartilages]].

===Development===
Most [[skeletons]] are of [[mesodermal]] origin in vertebrates. Especially axial skeletal elements, such as the vertebrae, are derived from the paraxial mesoderm (e.g., [[somites]]), which is regulated by molecular signals from the [[notochord]]. Trabecular cartilages, however, originate from the neural crest, and since they are located anterior to the rostral tip of the notochord,&lt;ref&gt;their derivatives are called the ''prechordal cranium'' (Couly et al., 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; they cannot receive signals from the notochord. Due to these specialisations, and their essential role in cranial development, many comparative morphologists and embryologists have argued their developmental or evolutionary origins. The general theory is that the trabecular cartilage is derived from the neural crest mesenchyme which fills anterior to the mandibular arch (premandibular domain).

==Other animals==
===Lamprey===
As clearly seen in the [[lamprey]], [[Cyclostome]] also has a pair of cartilaginous rods in the embryonic head which is similar to the trabecular cartilages in jawed vertebrates.
However, in 1916, [[Alexej Nikolajevich Sewertzoff]] pointed out that the cranial base of the lamprey is exclusively originated from the paraxial mesoderm. Then in 1948, [[:de:Alf Johnels|Alf Johnels]] reported the detail of the skeletogenesis of the lamprey, and showed that the “trabecular cartilages” in lamprey appear just beside the notochord, in a similar position to the parachordal cartilages in jawed vertebrates.&lt;ref&gt;Johnels AG (1948) On the development and morphology of the skeleton of the head of Petromyzon. Acta Zool 29: 139-279&lt;/ref&gt; Recent experimental studies also showed that the cartilages are derived from the head mesoderm.&lt;ref&gt;Kuratani S ''et al''., (2004) Developmental fate of the mandibular mesoderm in the lamprey, Lethenteron japonicum: comparative morphology and development of the gnathostome jaw with special reference to the nature of trabecula cranii. J. Exp. Zool. (Mol. Dev. Evol.). 302B, 458-468&lt;/ref&gt; The “trabecular cartilages” in the Cyclostome is no longer considered to be the homologue of the trabecular in the jawed vertebrates: the (true) trabecular cartilages were firstly acquired in the Gnathostome lineage.

==History==
{{refimprove-section|date=August 2017}}
The trabecular cartilages were first described in the [[grass snake]] by [[:de:Martin Heinrich Rathke|Martin Heinrich Rathke]] at 1839.&lt;ref&gt;Entwicklungsgeschichte der Natter. Konigsberg (1839)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1874, [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] suggested that the trabecular cartilages are a modified part of the [[splanchnocranium]]: they arose as the serial homologues of the [[pharyngeal arches]].{{fact|date=August 2017}}

The vertebrate [[jaw]] is generally thought to be the modification of the [[mandibular arch]] (1st pharyngeal arch). Since the trabecular cartilages appear anterior to the mandibular arch, if the trabecular cartilages are serial homologues of the pharyngeal arches, ancestral vertebrates should possess more than one pharyngeal arch (so-called "premandibular arches") anterior to the mandibular arch. The existence of premandibular arch(es) has been accepted by many comparative embryologists and morphologists (e.g., [[Edwin Stephen Goodrich]], [[Gavin de Beer]]). Moreover, [[:de: Erik Stensio|Erik Stensio]] reported premandibular arches and the corresponding branchiomeric nerves by the reconstruction of the [[Osteostraci|Osteostracans]] (e.g., ''[[Cephalaspis]]''; recently this arch was reinterpreted as the mandibular arch)

However, the existence of the premandibular arch(es) has been rejected, and the trabecular cartilages are no longer assumed to be one of the pharyngeal arches.

A '''[[astronomical transit|transit]] of Earth across the Sun as seen from Mars''' takes place when the planet [[Earth]] passes directly between the [[Sun]] and [[Mars]], obscuring a small part of the Sun's disc for an observer on Mars. During a transit, Earth would be visible from Mars as a small black disc moving across the face of the Sun. They occur every 26, 79 and 100 years, and every 1,000 years or so there is an extra 53rd-year transit.

==Conjunctions==
Transits of Earth from Mars usually occur in pairs, with one following the other after 79 years; rarely, there are three in the series. The transits also follow a 284-year cycle, occurring at intervals of 100.5, 79, 25.5, and 79 years; a transit falling on a particular date is usually followed by another transit 284 years later. Transits occurring when Mars is at its [[ascending node]] are in May, those at [[descending node]] happen in November. This cycle corresponds fairly closely to 151 Mars orbits, 284 Earth orbits, and 133 [[synodic period]]s, and is analogous to the cycle of [[transit of Venus|transits of Venus from Earth]], which follow a cycle of 243 years (121.5, 8, 105.5, 8). There are currently four such active series, containing from 8 to 25 transits. A new one is set to begin in 2394. The last series ending was in 1211.

==View from Mars==
No one has ever seen a transit of Earth from Mars, but the next transit will take place on November 10, 2084.&lt;ref name="Mars2084"/&gt; The last such transit took place on May 11, 1984.&lt;ref name="Earth1984"/&gt;

During the event, the [[Moon]] could almost always  also be seen in transit, although due to the distance between Earth and Moon, sometimes one body completes the transit before the other begins (this last occurred in the 1800 transit, and will happen again in 2394).

==View from Earth==
A transit of Earth from Mars corresponds to Mars being perfectly uniformly illuminated at [[astronomical opposition|opposition]] from Earth, its phase being 180.0° without any [[defect of illumination]]. During the 1879 event, this permitted [[Charles Augustus Young]] to attempt a careful measurement of the [[oblateness]] (polar compression) of Mars. He obtained the value 1/219, or 0.0046. This is close to the modern value of 1/154 (many sources will cite somewhat different values, such as 1/193, because even a difference of only a couple of kilometers in the values of Mars' polar and equatorial radii gives a considerably different result).

Much more recently, better measurements of the oblateness of Mars have been made by using [[radar]] from the Earth. Also, better measurements have been made by using artificial satellites that have been put into orbit around Mars, including ''[[Mariner 9]]'', ''[[Viking 1]]'', ''[[Viking 2]]'', and Soviet orbiters, and the more recent orbiters that have been sent from the Earth to Mars.

==In science fiction==
A [[science fiction]] short story published in 1971 by [[Arthur C. Clarke]],  called "Transit of Earth", depicts a doomed astronaut on Mars observing the transit in 1984. This short story was first published in the January 1971 issue of ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine.

==Grazing and simultaneous transits==
Sometimes Earth only grazes the Sun during a transit. In this case it is possible that in some areas of Mars a full transit can be seen while in other regions there is only a partial transit (no second or third contact). The last transit of this type was on 30 April 1211, and the next such transit will occur on 27 November [[5th millennium|4356]]. It is also possible that a transit of Earth can be seen in some parts of Mars as a partial transit, while in others Earth misses the Sun. Such a transit last occurred on 26 October 664, and the next transit of this type will occur on 14 December [[6th millennium|5934]].

The simultaneous occurrence of a [[Transit of Venus from Mars|transit of Venus]] and a transit of Earth is extremely rare, and will next occur in the year [[Timeline of the far future#Astronomical events|571,471]].

A [[tsunami]] is defined as a series of water waves caused by the displacement of a large volume of a body of water; in the case of this article the body of water being investigated will be a [[lake]] rather than an ocean. '''Tsunamis in lakes''' are becoming increasingly important to investigate as a hazard, due to the increasing popularity for recreational uses, and increasing populations that inhabit the shores of lakes. Tsunamis generated in lakes and reservoirs are of high concern because it is associated with a near field source region which means a decrease in warning times to minutes or hours.

==Causes==
{{see also|Megatsunami|Tsunami earthquake}}
Inland tsunami hazards can be generated by many different types of earth movement. Some of  these include [[earthquake]]s in or around lake systems, [[landslide]]s, debris flow, rock avalanches, and glacier calving. Volcanogenic processes such as gas and [[mass flow]] characteristics are discussed in more detail below.

===Earthquakes===
[[File:Tsunami comic book style.png|thumb|Figure 1: Diagram showing how earthquakes can generate a tsunami.]]

Tsunamis in lakes can be generated by [[fault (geology)|fault]] displacement beneath or around lake systems. Faulting shifts the ground in a vertical motion through reverse, normal or oblique strike slip faulting processes, this displaces the water above causing a tsunami (Figure 1). The reason strike-slip faulting does not cause tsunamis is because there is no vertical displacement within the fault movement, only lateral movement resulting in no displacement of the water. In an enclosed basin such as a lake, tsunamis are referred to as the initial wave produced by coseismic displacement from an earthquake, and the [[seiche]] as the harmonic resonance within the lake.&lt;ref&gt;Ichinose .G.A, et al; 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

In order for a tsunami to be generated certain criteria is required:
*Needs to occur just below the lake bottom.
*Earthquake is of high or moderate magnitude typically over magnitude four.
*Displaces a large enough volume of water to generate a tsunami.

These tsunamis are of high damage potential due to being within a lake, making them of a near field source. This means a vast decrease in warning times, resulting in organised [[emergency evacuation]]s after the generation of the tsunami being virtually impossible, and due to low lying shores even small waves lead to substantial flooding.&lt;ref&gt;Freundt Armin et al. 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Planning and education of residents needs to be done beforehand, so that when an earthquake is felt they know to head to higher ground and what routes to take to get there.

====Lake Tahoe====
[[Lake Tahoe]] is an example of a lake that is in danger of having a tsunami due to faulting processes. Lake Tahoe in California and Nevada USA lies within an intermountain basin bounded by faults, with most of these faults at the lake bottom or hidden in glaciofluvial deposits. Lake Tahoe has had many prehistoric eruptions and in studies of the lake bottom sediments, a 10m high scarp has displaced the lake bottom sediments, indicating that the water was displaced by the same magnitude, as well as generating a tsunami. A tsunami and seiche in Lake Tahoe can be treated as shallow-water long waves as the maximum water depth is much smaller than the wavelength. This demonstrates the interesting impact that lakes have on the tsunami wave characteristics, as it is very different from ocean tsunami wave characteristics due to the ocean being deeper, and lakes being relatively shallow in comparison. With ocean tsunami waves amplitudes only increase when the tsunami gets close to shore, in lake tsunami waves are generated and stay in a shallow environment.

This would have a major impact on the 34,000 permanent residences along the lake, not to mention the impact on tourism in the area. Tsunami run-ups would leave areas near the lake inundated due to permanent ground subsidence attributed to the earthquake, with the highest run-ups and amplitudes being attributed to the [[seiche]]s rather than the actual tsunami. The reason seiches cause so much damage is due to resonance within the bays reflecting the waves where they combine to make larger standing waves. For more information see [[seiche]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Ichinose .G.A, et al; 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Lake Tahoe also experienced a massive collapse of the western edge of the basin that formed McKinney Bay around 50,000 years ago. Is thought to have generated a tsunami/[[seiche|seiche wave]] with a height approaching {{convert|330|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last=Gardner|first=J.V.|title=The Lake Tahoe debris avalanche|conference=Geological Society of Australia|booktitle=15th Annual Geological Conference |date=July 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sub-aerial mass flows===
[[subaerial|Sub-aerial]] mass flows ([[landslide]]s or rapid [[mass wasting]]) happen when a large amount of sediment becomes unstable, this can happen for example from the shaking from an earthquake, or saturation of the sediment initiating a sliding layer. This volume of sediment then flows into the lake giving a sudden large displacement of water. Tsunamis generated by sub aerial mass flows are defined in terms of the first initial wave being the tsunami wave and any tsunamis in terms of sub aerial mass flows are characterised into three zones. A splash zone or wave generation zone, this is the region were landslides and water motion are coupled and it extends as far as the landslide travels. Near field area, were the concern is based on the characteristics of the tsunami wave such as amplitude and wavelength which are crucial for predictive purposes. Far field area, the process is influenced mainly by dispersion characteristics and is not often used when investigating tsunamis in lakes, as most lake tsunamis are related only to near field processes.&lt;ref&gt;Walder J.S, et al; 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

A modern example of a landslide into a reservoir lake, overtopping a dam, occurred in Italy with the [[Vajont Dam]] disaster in 1963. Evidence exists in [[paleoseismology|paleoseismological]] evidence and other sedimentary [[core sample]] proxies of catastrophic rock failures of landslide-triggered lake tsunamis worldwide, including in [[Lake Geneva]] during AD 563.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kremer|first=Katrina|author2=Guy Simpson|author3=Stéphanie Girardclos|last-author-amp=yes|title=Giant Lake Geneva tsunami in AD 563|journal=Nature Geoscience|date=28 October 2012|doi=10.1038/ngeo1618|url=http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ngeo1618.html|accessdate=31 October 2012|bibcode = 2012NatGe...5..756K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====New Zealand example====
In the event of the [[Alpine fault]] in New Zealand rupturing in the [[South Island]], it is predicted that there would be shaking of approximately magnitude eight in the lake side towns of [[Queenstown, New Zealand|Queenstown]] ([[Lake Wakatipu]]) and [[Wanaka]] ([[Lake Wanaka]]). These could possibly cause sub-aerial mass flows that could generate tsunamis within the lakes, this would have a devastating impact on the 28,224 residents ([[2013 New Zealand census]]) who occupy these lake towns, not only in the potential losses of life and property, but the damage to the booming tourism industry would take years to rebuild.

The [[Otago Regional Council]], responsible for the area, has recognised that in such an event, tsunamis could occur in both lakes.

===Volcanogenic processes===
[[File:LakeKivu satellite.jpg|thumb|Figure 2: Satellite image of [[Lake Kivu]] in Africa.]]

In this article the focus is on tsunamis generated in lakes by volcanogenic processes in terms of gas build up causing violent lake over turns, with other processes such as pyroclastic flows not accounted for, as it requires more complex modelling . Lake overturns can be incredibly dangerous and occur when gas trapped at the bottom of the lake is heated by rising magma causing an explosion and lake overturn; an example of this is Lake Kivu.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

====Lake Kivu====
[[Lake Kivu]], one of the [[African Great Lakes]], lies on the border between the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and [[Rwanda]], and is part of the [[East Africa Rift]]. Being part of the rift means it is affected by volcanic activity beneath the lake. This has led to a buildup of methane and carbon dioxide at the bottom of the lake, which can lead to violent [[limnic eruptions]].

[[Limnic eruptions]] (also called "lake over turns") are due to volcanic interaction with the water at the bottom of the lake that has high gas concentrations, this leads to heating of the lake and this rapid rise in temperature would spark a methane explosion displacing a large amount of water, followed nearly simultaneously by a release of carbon dioxide. This carbon dioxide would suffocate large numbers of people, with a possible tsunami generated from water displaced by the gas explosion affecting all of the 2 million people who occupy the shores of Lake Kivu.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.volcanolive.com/news16.htm Volcano Facts]{{dead link|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is incredibly important as the warning times for an event such as a lake overturn is incredibly short in the order of minutes and the event itself may not even be noticed. Education of locals and preparation is crucial in this case and a lot of research in this area has been done in order to try to understand what is happening within the lake, in order to try to reduce the effects when this phenomenon does happen.

A lake turn-over in Lake Kivu occurs from one of two scenarios. Either (1) up to another hundred years of gas accumulation leads to gas saturation in the lake, resulting in a spontaneous outburst of gas originating at the depth at which gas saturation has exceeded 100%, or (2) a volcanic or even seismic event triggers a turn-over. In either case a strong vertical lift of a large body of water results in a plume of gas bubbles and water rising up to and through the water surface. As the bubbling water column draws in fresh gas-laden water, the bubbling water column widens and becomes more energetic as a virtual "chain reaction" occurs which would look like a watery volcano. Very large volumes of water are displaced, vertically at first, then horizontally away from the centre at surface and horizontally inwards to the bottom of the bubbling water column, feeding in fresh gas-laden water. The speed of the rising column of water increases until it has the potential to rise 25m or more in the centre above lake level. The water column has the potential to widen to well in excess of a kilometre, in a violent disturbance of the whole lake. The watery volcano may take as much as a day to fully develop while it releases upwards of 400 billion cubic metres of gas (~12tcf). Some of these parameters are uncertain, particularly the time taken to release the gas and the height to which the water column can rise. As a secondary effect, particularly if the water column behaves irregularly with a series of surges, the lake surface will both rise by up to several metres and create a series of tsunamis or waves radiating away from the epicentre of the eruption. Surface waters may simultaneously race away from the epicentre at speeds as high as 20-40m/second, slowing as distances from the centre increase. The size of the waves created is unpredictable. Wave heights will be highest if the water column surges periodically, resulting in wave heights is great as 10-20m. This is caused by the ever-shifting pathway that the vertical column takes to the surface. No reliable model exists to predict this overall turnover behaviour. For tsunami precautions it will be necessary for people to move to high ground, at least 20m above lake level. A worse situation may pertain in the Ruzizi River where a surge in lake level would cause flash-flooding of the steeply sloping river valley dropping 700m to Lake Tanganyika, where it is possible that a wall of water from 20-50m high may race down the gorge. Water is not the only problem for residents of the Kivu basin; the more than 400 billion cubic metres of gas released creates a denser-than-air cloud which may blanket the whole valley to a depth of 300m or more. The presence of this opaque gas cloud, which would suffocate any living creatures with its mixture of carbon dioxide and methane laced with hydrogen sulphide, would cause the majority of casualties. Residents would be advised to climb to at least 400m above the lake level to ensure their safety. Strangely the risk of a gas explosion is not great as the gas cloud is only about 20% methane in carbon dioxide, a mixture that is difficult to ignite.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

==Modern examples==

===Askja===

At 11:24 PM on 21 July 2014, in a period experiencing an [[earthquake swarm]] related to the upcoming eruption of [[Bárðarbunga]], an 800m-wide section gave way on the slopes of the Icelandic volcano [[Askja]]. Beginning at 350m over water height, it caused a tsunami 20–30 meters high across the caldera, and potentially larger at localized points of impact. Thanks to the late hour, no tourists were present; however, search and rescue observed a steam cloud rising from the volcano, apparently geothermal steam released by the landslide. Whether geothermal activity played a role in the landslide is  uncertain.

==Hazard mitigation==
[[Hazard]] mitigation for tsunamis in lakes is immensely important in the preservation of life, infrastructure and property. In order for hazard management of tsunamis in lakes to function at full capacity there are four aspects that need to be balanced and interacted with each other, these are:

*'''Readiness''' (preparedness for a tsunami in the lake)
**Evacuation plans
**Making sure equipment and supplies are on standby in case of a tsunami
**Education of locals on what hazard is posed to them and what they need to do in the event of a tsunami in the lake
*'''Response''' to the tsunami event in the lake
**Rescue operations
**Getting aid into the area such as food and medical equipment
**Providing temporary housing for people who have been displaced.
*'''Recovery''' from the tsunami
**Re-establishing damaged road networks and infrastructure
**Re-building and/or relocation for damaged buildings
**Cleanup of debris and flooded areas of land.
*'''Reduction''' (plans to reduce the effects of the next tsunami)
**Putting in place land use zoning to provide a buffer for tsunami run ups, meaning that buildings cannot be built right on the lake shore.

When all these aspects are taken into consideration and continually managed and maintained, the vulnerability of an area to a tsunami within the lake decreases. This is not because the hazard itself has decreased but the awareness of the people who would be affected makes them more prepared to deal with the situation when it does occur. This reduces recovery and response times for an area, decreasing the amount of disruption and in turn the effect the disaster has on the community.

==Future research==
Investigation into the phenomena of tsunamis in lakes for this article was restricted by certain limitations. Internationally there has been a fair amount of research into certain lakes but not all lakes that can be affected by the phenomenon have been covered. This is especially true for New Zealand with the possible occurrence of tsunamis in the major lakes recognised as a hazard, but with no further research completed.

A '''vacuum coffee maker''' brews [[coffee]] using two chambers where [[vapor pressure]] and [[vacuum]] produce [[coffee]]. This type of coffee maker is also known as ''vac pot'', ''siphon'' or ''syphon coffee maker,'' and was invented by Loeff of [[Berlin]] in the 1830s. These devices have since been used for more than a century in many parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://baharris.org/coffee/History.htm Baharris: history]&lt;/ref&gt; Design and composition of the vacuum coffee maker varies.  The chamber material is [[borosilicate glass]], metal, or plastic, and the filter can be either a glass rod or a screen made of metal, cloth, paper, or nylon. The Napier Vacuum Machine, presented in 1840, was an early example of this technique.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090615050050/http://www.technotoad.com/the-napier-vacuum-coffee-maker.php The Napier Vacuum Machine]&lt;/ref&gt; While vacuum coffee makers generally were excessively complex for everyday use, they were prized for producing a clear brew, and were quite popular until the middle of the twentieth century. The [[Bauhaus]] interpretation of this device can be seen in [[Gerhard Marcks]]' Sintrax coffee maker of 1925.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110720232318/http://imagesvr.library.upenn.edu/cgi/i/image/image-idx?type=detail&amp;cc=fisher&amp;entryid=X-n2005060542&amp;viewid=1&amp;sstrt=1&amp;hits=1&amp;q1=aaaJenaer%20Glaswerkaaa&amp;cat1=All%20Categories&amp;thsz=12&amp;txsz=50&amp;slsz=1&amp;c=fisher Sintrax Coffee Maker, Jenaer Glaswerk]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.planet.nl/~rjeroenv/brewing/vacpots/sintrax/Sintrax.html Sintrax Coffee Maker]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Workings==
[[Image:Vakumpot north.svg|thumb|Vacuum pot coffee brewer: vapor pressure forces the water into the upper chamber]]
[[File:Water vapor pressure graph.jpg|thumb|As temperature increases, the vapor pressure of water increases, increasing the pressure in the bottom vessel and pushing water up the siphon. At the normal boiling point of 100 °C, the vapor pressure equals the standard atmospheric pressure of 760 Torr (760 mm of mercury).]]
{{see also|Siphon#Siphon coffee}}
A vacuum coffee maker operates as a [[siphon]], where heating and cooling the lower vessel changes the [[vapor pressure]] of water in the lower, first pushing the water up into the upper vessel, then allowing the water to fall back down into the lower vessel. Concretely, the principle of a vacuum coffee maker is to heat water in the lower vessel of the brewer until expansion forces the contents through a narrow tube into an upper vessel containing coffee grounds (as water temperature increases, dense liquid water increasingly converts to less dense water vapor gas, which takes up more space and thus increases pressure); when the water reaches and exceeds the boiling point (so the vapor pressure equals and then exceeds atmospheric pressure), the (water vapor) pressure in the lower vessel exceeds the (atmospheric) pressure in the top vessel and water is pushed up the siphon tube into the upper vessel. During brewing, a small amount of water and sufficient water vapor remain in the lower vessel and are kept hot enough so the pressure will support the column of water in the siphon. When enough time has elapsed that the coffee has finished brewing, the heat is removed and the pressure in the bottom vessel drops, so the force of gravity (acting on the water) and atmospheric pressure (pressing on the liquid in the upper vessel) push the water down into the lower vessel, through a strainer and away from the grounds, ending brewing. The coffee can then be decanted from the lower chamber; the device must usually be taken apart to pour out the coffee.

The iconic [[Moka pot]] coffee maker functions on the same principle but the water is forced up from the bottom chamber through a third middle chamber containing the coffee grounds to the top chamber which has an [[Air gap (plumbing)|air gap]] to prevent the brewed coffee from returning downwards. The prepared coffee is then poured off from the top.

=== Misconception ===
{{see also|Siphon}}
Note that siphons work by ''pushing'' (the water is under pressure – see [[hydrostatic pressure]], not under tension), and it is the changing vapor pressure in the lower vessel, combined with the constant atmospheric pressure in the upper vessel that drive the siphon. When the water cools the pressure in the lower vessel drops as steam condenses into dense water, taking up less volume and hence dropping the pressure. This creates a partial vacuum, causing the atmospheric pressure outside the container (along with gravity) to force the liquid back into the lower vessel.

=== Balance siphon ===
An early variation of this principle is called a ''balance siphon''. This implementation has the two chambers arranged side by side on a balance-like device, with a counterweight attached to the heated chamber. {{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} Once the vapor has forced the hot water out, the counterweight activates a spring-loaded [[snuffer]] which smothers the flame and allows the initial chamber to cool down thus lowering pressure (creating a vacuum) and causing the brewed coffee to seep in.

'''Vacuum consolidation''' (or vacuum preloading) is a soft soil improvement method that has been successfully used by [[Geotechnical engineering|geotechnical]] engineers and specialists of ground improvement companies in countries such as Australia, China, Korea, Thailand and France for [[soil]] improvement or [[land reclamation]] (Chu et al., 2005).  It does not necessarily require surcharge fill and vacuum loads of 80kPa or greater can, typically, be maintained for as long as required.  However, if loads of 80kPa or greater are needed in order to achieve the target soil improvement, additional surcharge may be placed on top of the vacuum system.  The vacuum preloading method is cheaper and faster than the fill surcharge method for an equivalent load in suitable areas.  Where the underlying ground consists of permeable materials, such as sand or sandy clay, the cost of the technique will be significantly increased due to the requirement of cut-off walls into non-permeable layers to seal off the vacuum.  It has been suggested by Carter et al. (2005) that the settlement resulting from vacuum preloading is less than that from a surcharge load of the same magnitude as vacuum [[Consolidation (soil)|consolidation]] is influenced by drainage boundary conditions.

The aquatic to terrestrial transition of [[vertebrate]] organisms occurred in the late [[Devonian]] era and was an important step in the evolutionary history of modern land vertebrates. The transition allowed animals to escape [[Competition (biology)|competitive pressure]] from the water and explore [[ecological niche|niche]] opportunities on land. Fossils from this period have allowed scientists to identify some of the species that existed during this transition, such as [[Tiktaalik]]&lt;ref name=Tiktaalik&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tiktaalik.uchicago.edu/Q&amp;A.html#Q5 |title=Tiktaalik roseae: Q&amp;A Session with Neil Shubin |publisher=Tiktaalik.uchicago.edu |date=April 2006 |accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Acanthostega]].&lt;ref name=Clack&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clack|first1=Jennifer A.|title=Gaining ground : the origin and evolution of tetrapods|date=2012|publisher=[[Indiana University Press]]|location=Bloomington|isbn=978-0-253-35675-8|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these species were also the first to develop adaptations suited to terrestrial over aquatic life, such as neck mobility and hindlimb locomotion.

The late Devonian vertebrate transition was preceded by the plant and invertebrate terrestrial invasion. These invasions allowed for the appropriate niche development that would ultimately facilitate the vertebrate invasion. While the late Devonian event was the first land invasion by vertebrate organisms, aquatic species have continued to develop adaptations suited to terrestrial life (and vice versa) from the late Devonian to the [[Holocene]].&lt;ref name=Symposium&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ashley-Ross|first1=M.

== Overview of transition ==
The vertebrate species that were important to the initial water to land transition can be qualified as being in one of five groups: [[sarcopterygii|Sarcopterygian fishes]], prototetrapods, aquatic tetrapods, true tetrapods, and terrestrial tetrapods. Many morphological changes occurred throughout this transition. Mechanical support structures changed from fins to limbs, the method of locomotion changed from swimming to walking, respiratory structures changed from gills to lungs, feeding mechanisms changed from suction feeding to biting, and mode of reproduction changed from larval development to metamorphosis.&lt;ref name=Greatest&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Long|first1=JA|last2=Gordon|first2=MS|title=The Greatest Step in Vertebrate History: A Paleobiological Review of the Fish‐Tetrapod Transition|journal=Physiological and Biochemical Zoology|date=September–October 2004|volume=77|issue=5|pages=700–719|doi=10.1086/425183|pmid=15547790}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evolutionary timeline ==

[[Lungfish]] appeared approximately 400 million years ago. It is a species that endured rapid evolution during the Devonian era, which became known as the dipnoan renaissance. The [[Acanthostega]] species, known as the fish with legs, is considered a [[tetrapod]] by structural findings but is postulated to have perhaps never left the aquatic environment. Its legs are not well-suited to support its weight. The bones of its forearm, the radius and ulna, are very thin at the wrist and also unable to support it on land. It also lacks a [[sacrum]] and strong ligaments at the hip, which would be integral to supporting the animal against gravity. In this sense, the species is considered a tetrapod but not one that has adapted well enough to walk on land. Furthermore, its gill bars have a supportive brace characterized for use as an underwater ear because it can pick up noise vibrations through the water. Tetrapods that adapted to terrestrial living adapted these gill bones to pick up sounds through air, and they later became the middle ear bones seen in mammalian tetrapods. [[Ichthyostega]], on the other hand, is considered to be a fully terrestrial tetrapod that perhaps depended on water for its aquatic young. Comparisons between the skeletal features of Acanthostega and Ichthyostega reveal that they had different habits. Acanthostega is likely exclusive to an aquatic environment, while Ichthyostega is progressed in the aquatic to terrestrial transition by living dominantly on the shores.&lt;ref name=Clack/&gt;

An evolutionary timeline of the late Devonian vertebrate terrestrial invasion demonstrates the changes that took place. A group of fish from the [[Givetian]] stage began developing limbs, and eventually evolved into aquatic tetrapods in the [[Famennian]] stage. Pederpes, Westlothiana, Protogyrinus, and Crassigyrinus descended from these species into the carboniferous period and were the first land vertebrates.&lt;ref name=Greatest/&gt;

A particularly important transitional species is one known as Tiktaalik. It has a fin, but the fin has bones within it that are similar to mammalian tetrapods. It has an upper arm bone, a lower arm bone, forearm bones, a wrist, and fingerlike projections. Essentially, it is a fin that can support the animal. Similarly, it also has a neck  that allows independent head movement from the body. Its ribs are also able to support the body in gravity. Its skeletal features exhibit its ability as a fish that can live in shallow water and also venture onto land.&lt;ref name=Tiktaalik/&gt;

== Driving factors ==
It took many millions of years for vertebrates to transition out of water onto land. During this time, both the competitive pressures that would push species out of the water and the  [[Ecological niche|niche]] occupation incentives that would pull species onto land were slowly building. The culmination of these driving factors are what ultimately facilitated the vertebrate transition.

=== Evolutionary pushes ===
Scientists believe that a long period of time where biotic and abiotic factors in the aquatic environment were unfavourable to certain aquatic organisms is what pushed their transition to shallower waters. Some of these push factors are environmental [[hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxia]], unfavourable aquatic temperatures, and increased salinity. Other constantly present factors such as predation, competition, waterborne diseases and parasites also contributed to the transition.&lt;ref name=Greatest/&gt;

A theory put forth by [[Joseph Barrell]] possibly helps explain what may have initiated these push factors to become relevant in the late Devonian. The extensive oxidized sediments that were present in Europe and North America during the late Devonian are evidence of severe droughts during this time. These droughts would cause small ponds and lakes to dry out, forcing certain aquatic organisms to move on land to find other bodies of water. Natural selection on these organisms eventually led to the evolution of the first terrestrial vertebrates.&lt;ref name=Clack/&gt;

=== Evolutionary pulls ===
The pull factors were secondary to the push factors, and only became significant once the pressures to leave the aquatic environment became significant. These were largely the niches and opportunities that were available for exploitation in the terrestrial environment, and include higher environmental oxygen partial pressures, favourable temperatures, and the lack of competitors and predators on land. The plants and invertebrates that had preceded the vertebrate invasion also provided opportunities in the form of abundant prey and lack of predators.&lt;ref name=Greatest/&gt;

== Barriers to transition ==
There were many challenges that the first land vertebrates faced. These challenges allowed for rapid natural selection and niche domination, resulting in an adaptive radiation that produced many different vertebrate land species in a relatively short period of time.

=== Sensory systems ===
Depending on the water depth at which a species lives, the visual perception of many aquatic species is better suited to darker environments than those on land. Similarly, hearing in aquatic organisms is better optimized for sounds underwater, where the speed and amplitude of sound is greater than in air.&lt;ref name=Symposium/&gt;

=== Homeostasis ===
[[Homeostasis]] was almost definitely a challenge for land invading vertebrates. [[Gas exchange]] and [[water balance]] are highly different in water and in air. Homeostasis mechanisms suitable for a terrestrial environment may have been necessary to develop before these organisms invaded land.&lt;ref name=Symposium/&gt;

=== Anatomy ===

The primary anatomical barrier is the development of lungs for proper gas exchange, however other anatomical barriers also exist. The stressors of the musculoskeletal system are different in air than they are in water, and the muscles and bones must be strong enough to withstand the increased effects of gravity on land.&lt;ref name=Symposium/&gt;

=== Behaviour ===

Many behaviours, such as reproduction, are specifically optimized to a wet environment. Navigation and locomotion are also highly different in aquatic environments compared to terrestrial environments.&lt;ref name=Symposium/&gt;

== Notable adaptations ==

=== Placement of eyes on head ===

The ancestral species of tetrapods that lived entirely in water had tall and narrow skulls with eyes facing sideways and forwards to maximize visibility for predators and prey in the aquatic environment. As the ancestors of early tetrapods started inhabiting shallower waters, these species had flatter skulls with eyes at the tops of their heads, which made it possible to spot food above them. Once the tetrapods transitioned onto land, the lineages evolved to have tall and narrow skulls with eyes facing sideways and forwards again. This allowed them to navigate through the terrestrial environment and look for predators and prey.&lt;ref name=Berkely&gt;{{cite web|url=http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/evograms_04 |title=The origin of tetrapods |publisher=Evolution.berkeley.edu |date= |accessdate=7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Head and neck mobility ===

Fish do not have necks, so the head is directly connected to the shoulders. In contrast, land animals use necks to move their heads so they can look down to see the food on the ground. The greater the mobility of the neck, the more visibility the land animal has. As lineages moved from completely aquatic environments to shallower waters and land, they gradually evolved vertebral columns that increased neck mobility. The first neck vertebra that evolved permitted the animals to have flexion and extension of the head so that they can see up and down. The second neck vertebra evolved to allow rotation of the neck for moving the head left and right. As tetrapod species continued to evolve on land, adaptations included seven or more vertebrae, allowing increasing neck mobility.&lt;ref name=Berkely/&gt;

=== Fused sacrum ===

The sacrum connects the pelvis and hindlimbs and is useful for motion on land. The aquatic ancestors of tetrapods did not have a sacrum, so it was speculated to have evolved for locomotive function exclusive to terrestrial environments. However, the Acanthostega species is one of the earliest lineages to have a sacrum, even though it is a fully aquatic species. Once species moved onto land, the trait was adapted for terrestrial locomotion support, which is evidenced by additional vertebrae fusing similarly to permit additional support. This is an example of exaptation, where a trait performs a function that did not arise through natural selection for its current use.&lt;ref name=Berkely/&gt;

=== Lost adaptations ===

As the lineages evolved to adapt to terrestrial environments, many lost traits that were better suited for the aquatic environment. Many lost their gills, which were only useful for obtaining oxygen in water. Their tail fins became smaller. They lost the [[lateral line]] system, a network of canals along the skull and jaw that are sensitive to vibration, which does not work outside of an aquatic environment.&lt;ref name=Berkely/&gt;

== Future invasions ==

For successful land invasion, the species had several pre-adaptations like air-breathing and limb-based locomotion. Aspects such as reproduction and swallowing, however, have bound these species to the aquatic environment. These pre-adaptations have allowed vertebrates to venture onto land hundreds of times, but were not able to accomplish the same degree of prolific radiation into diverse terrestrial species.&lt;ref name=Symposium/&gt; To understand the potential of future invasions, studies must evaluate the models of evolutionary steps taken in past invasions. The commonalities to current and future invasions may then be elucidated to predict the effects of environmental changes.

There is no formal definition for the '''water-energy nexus''' - the concept refers to the relationship between the [[water]] used for [[energy production]],&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Spang, E. S., Moomaw, W. R., Gallagher, K. S., Kirshen, P. H., and Marks, D. H. (2014). "The water consumption of energy production: an international comparison." ''Environmental Research Letters'', 9(10), 105002.&lt;/ref&gt; including both [[electricity]] and sources of fuel such as [[petroleum|oil]] and [[natural gas]], and the energy consumed to extract, purify, deliver, heat/cool, treat and dispose of water (and wastewater) sometimes referred to as the [[energy intensity]] (EI). The relationship is not truly a closed loop as the water used for energy production need not be the same water that is processed using that energy, but all forms of energy production require some input of water making the relationship inextricable.

Among the first studies to evaluate the water and energy relationship was a [[life-cycle analysis]] conducted by [[Peter Gleick]] in 1994 that highlighted the interdependence and initiated the joint study of water and energy.&lt;ref&gt;Gleick, P.

''Annual Review of Energy and the Environment'', 19(1), 267-299.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 the [[US Department of Energy]] (DOE) released their report on the water-energy nexus citing the need for joint water-energy policies and better understanding of the nexus and its susceptibility to [[climate change]] as a matter of [[national security]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Bauer, D., Philbrick, M., and Vallario, B. (2014). "The Water-Energy Nexus: Challenges and Opportunities." U.S. Department of Energy.&lt;/ref&gt; The hybrid Sankey diagram in the DOE's 2014 water-energy nexus report summarizes water and [[energy flow (ecology)|energy flows]] in the US by sector, demonstrating [[interdependence]] as well as singling out [[Electric power|thermoelectric power]] as the single largest user of water, used mainly for cooling. 

==  Water Used for Energy Production ==
[[File:Spang-2014-The water consumption of energy production.tif|thumb|486x486px|Figure 1. Total WCEP by energy category, 2008]]
All types of energy generation consume water either to process the raw materials used in the facility, constructing and maintaining the plant, or to just generate the electricity itself. Renewable power sources such as [[Photovoltaic solar cell|photovoltaic solar]] and [[wind power]], which require little water to produce energy, require water in processing the raw materials to build. Water can either be ''used'' or ''consumed,'' and can be categorised as fresh, ground, surface, blue, grey or green among others.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Water is considered used if it does not reduce the supply of water to downstream users, i.e. water that is taken and returned to the same source (instream use), such as in thermoelectric plants that use water for cooling and are by far the largest users of water.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While used water is returned to the system for downstream uses, it has usually been degraded in some way, mainly due to thermal or chemical pollution, and the natural flow has been altered which does not factor into an assessment if only the quantity of water is considered. Water is consumed when it is removed completely from the system, such as by evaporation or consumption by crops or humans. When assessing water use all these factors must be considered as well as spatiotemporal considerations making precise determination of water use very difficult.

Spang et al. (2014) conducted a study looking at the water consumption for energy production (WCEP) internationally that both showed the variation in energy types produced across countries as well as the vast differences in efficiency of energy production per unit of water use (figure 1).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Operations of water distribution systems and power distribution systems under emergency conditions of limited power and water availability is an important consideration for improving the overall resilience of the water - energy nexus. Khatavkar and Mays (2017) &lt;ref&gt; Khatavkar, P., &amp; Mays, L. W. (2017 a) Model for the Real-Time Operation of Water Distribution Systems under Limited Power Availability. In World Environmental and Water Resources Congress 2017 (pp. 171-183). &lt;/ref&gt; present a methodology for control of water distribution and power distribution systems under emergency conditions of drought and limited power availability to ascertain at least minimal supply of cooling water to the power plants. Khatavkar and Mays (2017 b) &lt;ref&gt;Khatavkar, P., &amp; Mays, L. W. (2017). Testing an Optimization/Simulation Model for the Real-Time Operations of Water Distribution Systems under Limited Power Availability. In Congress on Technical Advancement 2017 (pp. 1-9).&lt;/ref&gt; applied an optimization model for water - energy nexus system for a hypothetical regional level system which showed an improved resilience for several contingency scenarios.

== Energy Intensity ==

=== US (California) ===
In 2001 operating water systems in the US consumed approximately 3% of the total annual electricity (~75 TWh).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Cohen, R., Nelson, B., and Wolff, G. (2004). "Energy Down The Drain: The Hidden Costs of California’s Water Supply." E. Cousins, ed., Natural Resources Defense Council&lt;/ref&gt; The California's [[State Water Project]] (SWP) and [[Central Valley Project]] (CVP) are together the largest water system in the world with the highest water lift, over 2000&amp;nbsp;ft. across the [[Tehachapi mountains]], delivering water from the wetter and relatively rural north of the state, to the [[agricultural]]ly intensive central valley, and finally to the [[arid]] and heavily populated south. Consequently, the SWP and CVP are the single largest consumers of electricity in California consuming approximately 5 TWh of electricity each per year.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 2001, 19% of the state’s total electricity use (~48 TWh/year) was used in processing water including end uses, with the urban sector accounting for 65% of this.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Klein, G., Krebs, M., Hall, V., O’Brien, T., and Blevins, B. B. (2005). "California's Water – Energy Relationship." California Energy Commission, Sacramento, California.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to electricity, 30% of California’s natural gas consumption was due to water-related processes, mainly residential water heating, and 88 million gallons of diesel was consumed by groundwater pumps for agriculture.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The residential sector alone accounted for 48% of the total combined electricity and natural gas consumed for water-related processes in the state.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

According to the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) Energy Division’s Embedded Energy in Water Studies report:&lt;blockquote&gt;''“'[[Energy Intensity]]' refers to the average amount of energy needed to transport or treat water or wastewater on a per unit basis"''&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Energy Intensity is sometimes used synonymously with embedded or [[embodied energy]]. In 2005, water deliveries to Southern California were assessed to have an average EI of 12.7 MWh/MG, nearly two-thirds of which was due to transportation.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Following the findings that a fifth of California’s electricity is consumed in water-related processes including end-use,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; the CPUC responded by authorising a statewide study into the relationship between energy and water that was conducted by the California Institute for Energy and Environment (CIEE), and developed programs to save energy through water conservation.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Bennett, B., and Park, L. (2010). "Embedded Energy in Water Studies Study 1: Statewide and Regional Water-Energy Relationship." California Public Utilities Commission Energy Division.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, B., and Park, L. (2010). "Embedded Energy in Water Studies Study 2: Water Agency and Function Component Study and Embedded Energy- Water Load Profiles." California Public Utilities Commission Energy Division.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hydroelectricity ==
[[Hydroelectricity]] is a special case of water used for energy production mainly because hydroelectric power generation is regarded as being clean and [[renewable]], and dams (the main source of hydroelectric production) serve multiple purposes besides energy generation, including flood prevention, storage, control and recreation which make justifiable allocation analyses difficult.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Furthermore, the impacts of hydroelectric power generation can be hard to quantify both in terms of evaporative consumptive losses and altered quality of water, since damming results in flows that are much colder than for flowing streams. In some cases the moderation of flows can be seen as a rivalry of water use in time may also need to accounted for in impact analysis.
