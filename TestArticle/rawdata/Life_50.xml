'''0010x0010''' is a Dutch-born [[audiovisual art]]ist, currently living in Los Angeles.

==Early years==
In his early years, being inspired by underground techno, he released a series of [[Gramophone record|vinyl records]] under various pseudonyms (only one using his real name) and he performed live [[acid techno]] sets at underground parties such as Acid Rain at Amsterdam Graansilo. During the recording sessions for one of the tracks he produced for ex [[Soul II Soul]] and [[The Shamen]] singer Victoria Wilson James's album on Sony Music,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Victoria-Wilson-James-Colorfields/release/591843|title=Victoria Wilson-James - Colorfields|website=Discogs|accessdate=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was suggested that he audition for the "De Bende van Venlo", a theatre piece based on a true crime story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theaterencyclopedie.nl/wiki/De_bende_van_Venlo_-_Stichting_Theaterwerkplaats_Limburg_Het_Kruis_van_Bourgondi%C3%AB_-_1997-07-04|title=De bende van Venlo - Stichting Theaterwerkplaats Limburg Het Kruis van Bourgondië - 1997-07-04 - TheaterEncyclopedie|website=theaterencyclopedie.nl|accessdate=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was cast in one of the lead roles and performed over thirty European shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/1997/07/05/vooral-sfeer-en-spektakel-in-stuk-de-bende-van-venlo-7359654-a1211521|title=Vooral sfeer en spektakel in stuk De Bende van Venlo|website=nrc.nl|accessdate=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/binnenland/toneelstuk-over-bende-van-venlo-begint-met-rap-gewetenloze-killers-een-gruwelijke-afslachting~a484780/|title=Toneelstuk over Bende van Venlo begint met rap 'Gewetenloze killers, een gruwelijke afslachting' – Binnenland – de Volkskrant|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/theater/de-bende-van-venlo-zit-vol-met-gemiste-kansen~a494401/|title=De Bende van Venlo zit vol met gemiste kansen – Theater – de Volkskrant|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Los Angeles==
After the theatre experience, Universal / [[Island Records]] won the label-bidding and signed him as an artist and producer.He released one single and one video before he left the label due to creative differences and moved from London to Los Angeles to work on his art, film, photography and editing &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2011/01/in-the-works-new-doc-from-paris-is-burning-director-sundances-pariah-chicago-mob-boss-more-243995/|title=In the Works: New Doc from "Paris is Burning" Director, Sundance’s "Pariah," Chicago Mob Boss &amp; More - IndieWire|first=Bryce J.|last=Renninger|website=www.indiewire.com|accessdate=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; career. He took a break from that to release the track ''LA Mellow'' (as D'ray), a collaboration with Dutch Dj, producer [[Gregor Salto]]. ''Ultimate Miami 2'', the album with ''LA Mellow'' and music by artists like [[Wiwek]], [[Zki &amp; Dobre|Chocolate Puma]] and [[Sidney Samson]] reached No. 6 at Beatport's House top 100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bptoptracker.com/artist/dray/298277/releases|title=D'RAY – Beatport Top Tracker|first=Julien|last=Mahin|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2015, he finished working as the visual supervisor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asiancemagazine.com/2010/07/31/interview-with-dutch-filmmaker-mziah|title=Interview with Dutch filmmaker mZiah – Asiance Magazine|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of a documentary about Russian director [[Andrei Tarkovsky]] based on his diaries [[Time Within Time: The Diaries 1970–1986|Time within Time]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2311128/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast|title=Tarkovsky: Time Within Time|date=1 January 2000|publisher=|via=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/read/tarkovsky-does-berlin-0817|title=Among the Tarkovsky Fanatics at an Underground Retrospective in Berlin – VICE – United States|date=18 August 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; starring [[Tonino Guerra]]. In 2016, he released two EPs (as 0010x0010 and T3TSUO 303) on his Generation Acid label which both landed in the [[Beatport]] Techno Top 100 charts. The May 2017 released [[acid techno]] album |||Ø||| &lt;ref&gt;https://www.discogs.com/0010X0010-%C3%98/release/10234031&lt;/ref&gt; made it to the techno and house top 10 charts on both [[Beatport]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bptoptracker.com/label/generation-acid/28924/releases|title=Generation Acid – Beatport Top Tracker|first=Julien|last=Mahin|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Juno Records]].

'''3D Virtual Creature Evolution''', abbreviated to 3DVCE, is an artificial evolution simulation program created by Lee Graham.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title=Speciation  Through Selection and Drift | last1=Graham | first1=Lee | last2=Oppacher | first2=Franz | publisher=ACTA Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website is currently down. Its purpose is to visualize and research common themes in [[body plan]]s and strategies to achieve a [[fitness function]] of the [[Artificial life|artificial organisms]] generated and maintained by the system in their given environment. The program was inspired by [[Karl Sims|Karl Sims’]] 1994 artificial evolution program, Evolved Virtual Creatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference| title=Evolving Virtual Creatures | last1=Sims | first1=Karl | url=http://www.karlsims.com/papers/siggraph94.pdf | book-title=SIGGRAPH ‘94 Proceedings|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference| title=Evolving 3D Morphology and Behavior by Competition | last1=Sims | first1=Karl | url=http://www.karlsims.com/papers/alife94.pdf | book-title=Artificial Life IV Proceedings|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program is run through volunteers who download the program from the home website and return information from completed simulations. It is currently only available on [[Windows]] and in some cases [[Linux]].

==Settings==
3DVCE uses [[evolutionary algorithms]] to simulate evolution. The user sets the body plan restrictions (maximum number of segment types, branching segments’ length and depth limits, and size limits) and whether fitness score is scaled in relation to size. Limb interpenetration is also an option. Reproduction / population settings include the size of each population and their run time (how long each individual has to attain a fitness score), percentage of individuals who get to reproduce (tournament size), what percentage sexually or asexually reproduce, and selection type is then determined. Crossover rate determines what percentage of an individual is created via crossover of parents and mutation. Mutation rate in body and brain is then determined. Specific mathematical operations and values can be attributed to the creature’s brain as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title=Simulating Biped Jumping Behavior using Evolutionary Algorithm | author=Heryadi, Yaya | ISSN=1978-774X | year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fitness function is then determined. Artificial organisms’ fitness score is determined by how well they achieve their fitness goal within their evaluation time. Fitness functions include distance traveled, maximum height, average height, “TOG” (determined by amount of time creature is in contact with ground), and “Sphere” (determined by creature’s ability to catch and hold spheres). These goals are not individualized and can be set to specific strengths (from zero, as not having an influence on fitness, to one, or having maximum influence) to determine the fitness goal. What generations the fitness function applies to can also be set. The environment, or “Terrain”, is then determined. This includes a flat plain, bumpy terrain (in which a hill is generated around creature that constantly inclines as distance is traveled from the creature’s spawning point), water (a low gravity simulator, non-functional), and “spheres” (spheres are generated above creature to catch).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ottawaskeptics.org/topics/skepticism/132-tam-6-highlights | title=TAM 6 Highlights: 3DVCE-Lee Graham | publisher=Ottawa Skeptics | author=Barry Green | date=June 28, 2008 | accessdate=April 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Simulation==
Everything in the simulation is viewed from a [[First person (video games)|first person viewpoint]]. After settings are determined, the first generation is generated from randomly created individuals. All creatures appear at the same spawning point and are made of segments or rectangular prisms connected to others at joints. Colors are assigned to segment types randomly. Segment type is determined by the size and joints a segment has. Colors indicate nothing else than that. These first generation creatures move randomly, with no influence from the fitness goal. Creatures with the largest fitness value reproduce and the following generation is based on this reproduction. Eventually, patterns in the population form and fitness increases even further. Fitness function can be changed during the simulation to simulate environmental changes and individual runs can be duplicated to simulate different lineages or [[Speciation (genetic algorithm)|speciation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://seedmagazine.com/content/article/standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants/ | title=Standing On The Shoulders Of Giants: Video games are reshaping how we perform and promote science | author=Morgan, Abbie | publisher=SEED Magazine | date=September 7, 2008 | accessdate=February 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| url=http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~dubroe/journalism/evolution.pdf | title=Evolution Mutates Beyond Biology | author=Dubrofsky, Elan | publisher=UBC | year=2008 | accessdate=September 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

3DVCE is not only for evolutionary research. Objects can also be spawned for graphics and simulated physics tests. This includes pre-installed blocks, spheres, grenades, and structures that can either be thrown from camera or generated at a spawning point. Artificial gravity can also be manipulated. Random and archived creatures can also be re-spawned to manipulate or view. Lee Graham has also included a [[TARDIS]] in the simulation, which when moved into can teleport the camera back to the original spawning point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.openviv.com/video/07AU7p_cytQ/blue-strand-evolved-virtual-creature | title=Blue Strand: Evolved Virtual Creatures | publisher=Penviv | accessdate=April 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creatures==
[[Image:Evolved Virtual Creature (Rolling Ribbon).png|thumb | right | 300px | An example of a Rolling Ribbon creature on a flat terrain]]
[[Convergent evolution]] occurs often in 3DVCE, as similar structures and behaviors of the creatures form to maximize fitness. Two-Armed Jumpers consist of a small core and two large symmetrical "wings", and evolve in response to jumping and distance requirement. These creatures propel themselves forward using their limbs by jiggling or flapping them. Jumping Ribbons and Springs consist of a chain of segments and evolve in response to max height and distance. They contract or curl up and stretch out their body to leap into the air. Rolling Ribbons and Springs are very similar to the previous group, except they are often larger and segments are more repetitive. They evolve in response to average height, distance, and TOG (touching the ground). They roll on the ground to propel their head into the air to attain height while still touching the ground. Some simply roll in a horizontal fashion like a cylinder. Single-Joint Powered Creatures have more erratic structures and evolve in response to distance on bumpy terrain. They have one large segment in back which kicks the creature forward, but being poorly balanced they use the rest of their bodies to get back up after stumbling or prevent stumbles altogether.

Many other types of creatures also form that do not necessarily fit the four main groups previously described by Lee Graham. Tall stick-like creatures also evolve to attain maximum height. Some users have been able to fix the water simulator to evolve creatures that swim. Many other creatures evolve that share traits of multiple groups. There are currently over 220 creatures archived on the main website, which can be found on YouTube by visiting the "Creature Mann" channel.

6ix is best known for his work with [[Gaithersburg, Maryland]] rapper [[Logic (musician)|Logic]] (2010 – present) for whom he has produced over 43 songs, including eight from [[Logic (musician)|Logic's]] latest mixtape [[Bobby Tarantino II]]. The first song [[Logic (musician)|Logic]] and 6ix produced together was Love Jones from Logic's first mixtape.

6ix is a native of [[Bowie, Maryland]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonian.com/2015/03/01/a-young-biracial-rapper-from-dc-is-the-next-big-thing/&lt;/ref&gt; His father is a doctor; his mother is an engineer; his older brother is an aerospace engineer.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mishthimusic.com/post/137250184937/6ix-otherwise-known-as-arjun-ivatury-is-a Origins of Logic and Producer 6s Working Relationship&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://theunn.com/2017/12/arjun-ivatury-wins-grammy-nomination/&lt;/ref&gt; Before he became a full-time producer, 6ix attended the [[University of Maryland, College Park]], where he majored in neurology and physiology. In his senior year he dropped out of college in 2013 to move to Los Angeles with Logic to pursue a career in music production; he was 30 credits shy of his degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=C.M.|first1=Emmanuel|title=Behind the Boards: 6ix, Logic’s Producer|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2016/01/behind-the-boards-6ix-logics-producer/|accessdate=14 March 2017|publisher=XXL|date=14 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;He was nominated for Grammys for the first time for producing the song [[1-800-273-8255]] by Logic featuring [[Alessia Cara]] and [[Khalid (singer)|Khalid]]. In an interview with SlimShady magazine, he reportedly said that Richik Dadhich is his greatest fan. 
===YSIV===
He is also the executive producer of Logic's latest album "YSIV" released on September 28, 2018 and is also collaborating with Logic for his upcoming project called "Ultra 85".

==Content==
It deals with standard problems in the theory of [[personal identity]] in the form of a dialogue between a terminally ill university professor at a small Midwestern college,, Gretchen Weirob, and her two friends, Sam Miller and Dave Cohen. The views represented include those of [[Bernard Williams]], [[John Locke]], and [[Derek Parfit]]. The format of associating different philosophical positions with different characters in a dialogue recalls [[David Hume]]'s ''[[Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion]]''.

An '''agent-based model''' ('''ABM''') is a class of [[computational models]] for [[computer simulation|simulating]] the actions and interactions of autonomous agents (both individual or collective entities such as organizations or groups) with a view to assessing their effects on the system as a whole. It combines elements of [[game theory]], [[complex systems]], [[emergence]], [[computational sociology]], [[multi-agent system]]s, and [[evolutionary programming]]. [[Monte Carlo method]]s are used to introduce randomness.  Particularly within ecology, ABMs are also called '''individual-based models''' ('''IBMs'''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Grimm |first1=Volker |first2=Steven F. |last2=Railsback |title=Individual-based Modeling and Ecology |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2005 |pages=485 |isbn=978-0-691-09666-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and individuals within IBMs may be simpler than fully autonomous agents within ABMs. A review of recent literature on individual-based models, agent-based models, and multiagent systems shows that ABMs are used on non-computing related scientific domains including [[biology]], ecology and [[social science]].&lt;ref name="Niazi-Hussain"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Muaz |last1=Niazi |first2=Amir |last2=Hussain |year=2011 |title=Agent-based Computing from Multi-agent Systems to Agent-Based Models: A Visual Survey |journal=Scientometrics |volume=89 |issue=2 |pages=479–499 |doi=10.1007/s11192-011-0468-9 |url=http://cecosm.yolasite.com/resources/Accepted_Scientometrics_ABM_Website.pdf |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012005027/http://cecosm.yolasite.com/resources/Accepted_Scientometrics_ABM_Website.pdf |archivedate=October 12, 2013 |deadurl=yes|arxiv=1708.05872 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Agent-based modeling is related to, but distinct from, the concept of '''[[multi-agent system]]s''' or '''multi-agent simulation''' in that the goal of ABM is to search for explanatory insight into the collective behavior of agents obeying simple rules, typically in natural systems, rather than in designing agents or solving specific practical or engineering problems.&lt;ref name="Niazi-Hussain"/&gt;

Agent-based models are a kind of [[Microscale and macroscale models|microscale model]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Leif |last1=Gustafsson |first2=Mikael |last2=Sternad |year=2010 |title=Consistent micro, macro, and state-based population modelling |journal=Mathematical Biosciences |volume=225 |issue=2 |pages=94–107 |doi=10.1016/j.mbs.2010.02.003 |pmid=20171974 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that simulate the simultaneous operations and interactions of multiple agents in an attempt to re-create and predict the appearance of complex phenomena. The process is one of [[emergence]] from the lower (micro) level of systems to a higher (macro) level. As such, a key notion is that simple behavioral rules generate complex behavior. This principle, known as [[KISS principle|K.I.S.S.]] ("Keep it simple, stupid"), is extensively adopted in the modeling community. Another central tenet is that the whole is greater than the sum of the parts.  Individual agents are typically characterized as boundedly rational, presumed to be acting in what they perceive as their own interests, such as reproduction, economic benefit, or social status,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://policy.rutgers.edu/andrews/projects/abm/abmarticle.htm |title=Agent-Based Models of Industrial Ecosystems |publisher=[[Rutgers University]] |date=October 6, 2003 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720041914/http://policy.rutgers.edu/andrews/projects/abm/abmarticle.htm |archivedate=July 20, 2011 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; using heuristics or simple decision-making rules. ABM agents may experience "learning", adaptation, and reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/99/suppl_3/7280 |title=Agent-based modeling: Methods and techniques for simulating human systems |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=99 |pages=7280–7 |date=May 14, 2002 |doi=10.1073/pnas.082080899 |pmid=12011407 |pmc=128598 |last1=Bonabeau |first1=E. |bibcode=2002PNAS...99.7280B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most agent-based models are composed of: (1) numerous agents specified at various scales (typically referred to as agent-granularity); (2) decision-making heuristics; (3) learning rules or adaptive processes; (4) an interaction topology; and (5) an environment. ABMs are typically implemented as [[computer simulation]]s, either as custom software, or via ABM toolkits, and this software can be then used to test how changes in individual behaviors will affect the system's emerging overall behavior.

==History==
The idea of agent-based modeling was developed as a relatively simple concept in the late 1940s. Since it requires computation-intensive procedures, it did not become widespread until the 1990s.

===Early developments===
The history of the agent-based model can be traced back to the [[Von Neumann universal constructor|Von Neumann machine]], a theoretical machine capable of reproduction. The device [[John von Neumann|von Neumann]] proposed would follow precisely detailed instructions to fashion a copy of itself. The concept was then built upon by von Neumann's friend [[Stanislaw Ulam]], also a mathematician; Ulam suggested that the machine be built on paper, as a collection of cells on a grid. The idea intrigued von Neumann, who drew it up—creating the first of the devices later termed [[cellular automata]].
Another advance was introduced by the mathematician [[John Horton Conway|John Conway]].  He constructed the well-known [[Conway's Game of Life|Game of Life]]. Unlike von Neumann's machine, Conway's Game of Life operated by tremendously simple rules in a virtual world in the form of a 2-dimensional [[checkerboard]].

===1970s and 1980s: the first models===

One of the earliest agent-based models in concept was [[Thomas Schelling]]'s segregation model,&lt;ref name="Thomas"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schelling |first=Thomas C. |title=Dynamic Models of Segregation |year=1971 |journal=Journal of Mathematical Sociology |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=143–186 |url=http://zolaist.org/wiki/images/c/cf/Models_of_Segregation.pdf |format=PDF |doi=10.1080/0022250x.1971.9989794}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was discussed in his paper "Dynamic Models of Segregation" in 1971.  Though Schelling originally used coins and graph paper rather than computers, his models embodied the basic concept of agent-based models as autonomous agents interacting in a shared environment with an observed aggregate, emergent outcome.

In the early 1980s, [[Robert Axelrod]] hosted a tournament of [[Prisoner's Dilemma]] strategies and had them interact in an agent-based manner to determine a winner.  Axelrod would go on to develop many other agent-based models in the field of political science that examine phenomena from [[ethnocentrism]] to the dissemination of culture.&lt;ref name="Axelrod_1997"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Axelrod |given=Robert |authorlink=Robert Axelrod |year=1997 |title=The Complexity of Cooperation: Agent-Based Models of Competition and Collaboration |publisher=Princeton: Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-01567-5 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;
By the late 1980s, [[Craig Reynolds (computer graphics)|Craig Reynolds]]' work on [[flocking behavior|flocking]] models contributed to the development of some of the first biological agent-based models that contained social characteristics. He tried to model the reality of lively biological agents, known as [[artificial life]], a term coined by [[Christopher Langton]].

The first use of the word "agent" and a definition as it is currently used today is hard to track down.  One candidate appears to be [[John Henry Holland|John Holland]] and John H. Miller's 1991 paper "Artificial Adaptive Agents in Economic Theory",&lt;ref name="Holland"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Holland |first1=J.H. |last2=Miller |first2=J.H. |title=Artificial Adaptive Agents in Economic Theory |year=1991 |journal=American Economic Review |volume=81 |issue=2 |pages=365–71 |url=http://zia.hss.cmu.edu/miller/papers/aaa.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051027152415/http://zia.hss.cmu.edu/miller/papers/aaa.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2005-10-27 |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; based on an earlier conference presentation of theirs.

At the same time, during the 1980s, social scientists, mathematicians, operations researchers, and a scattering of people from other disciplines developed Computational and Mathematical Organization Theory (CMOT).  This field grew as a special interest group of The Institute of Management Sciences (TIMS) and its sister society, the Operations Research Society of America (ORSA).

===1990s: expansion===
With the appearance of StarLogo in 1990, [[Swarm (simulation)|Swarm]] and [[NetLogo]] in the mid-1990s and [[Repast (modeling toolkit)|RePast]] and [[AnyLogic]] in 2000, or GAMA&lt;ref&gt;[http://gama-platform.org/ GAMA]&lt;/ref&gt; in 2007 as well as some custom-designed code, modelling software became widely available and the range of domains that ABM was applied to, grew.  Bonabeau (2002) is a good survey of the potential of agent-based modeling as of the time&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bonabeau |first=Eric |title=Agent-based modeling: methods and techniques for simulating human systems |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=99 |issue=3 |pages=7280–7287 |year=2002 |doi=10.1073/pnas.082080899 |bibcode=2002PNAS...99.7280B |pmid=12011407 |pmc=128598}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1990s were especially notable for the expansion of ABM within the social sciences, one notable effort was the large-scale ABM, [[Sugarscape]], developed by
[[Joshua M. Epstein]] and [[Robert Axtell]] to simulate and explore the role of social phenomena such as seasonal migrations, pollution, sexual reproduction, combat, and transmission of disease and even culture.&lt;ref name="GAS"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Joshua M. |last1=Epstein |authorlink1=Joshua M. Epstein |first2=Robert |last2=Axtell |authorlink2=Robert Axtell |title=Growing artificial societies: social science from the bottom up |publisher=Brookings Institution Press |date=October 11, 1996 |pages=224 |isbn=978-0-262-55025-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable 1990s developments included [[Carnegie Mellon University]]'s [[Kathleen Carley]] ABM,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.casos.cs.cmu.edu/projects/construct/index.php |title=Construct |publisher=Computational Analysis of Social Organizational Systems |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to explore the co-evolution of social networks and culture.
During this 1990s timeframe [[Nigel Gilbert]] published the first textbook on Social Simulation: Simulation for the social scientist (1999) and established a journal from the perspective of social sciences: the ''[[Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation]]'' (JASSS). Other than JASSS, agent-based models of any discipline are within scope of SpringerOpen journal ''[[Complex Adaptive Systems Modeling]]'' (CASM).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casmodeling.com Springer Complex Adaptive Systems Modeling Journal (CASM)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the mid-1990s, the social sciences thread of ABM began to focus on such issues as designing effective teams, understanding the communication required for organizational effectiveness, and the behavior of social networks.  CMOT—later renamed Computational Analysis of Social and Organizational Systems (CASOS)—incorporated more and more agent-based modeling.  Samuelson (2000) is a good brief overview of the early history,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Samuelson |first=Douglas A. |title=Designing Organizations |journal=OR/MS Today |date=December 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Samuelson (2005) and Samuelson and Macal (2006) trace the more recent developments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Samuelson |first=Douglas A. |title=Agents of Change |journal=OR/MS Today |date=February 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.orms-today.org/orms-8-06/fragent.html |last1=Samuelson |first1=Douglas A. |last2=Macal |first2=Charles M. |title=Agent-Based Modeling Comes of Age |journal=OR/MS Today |date=August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1990s, the merger of TIMS and ORSA to form [[INFORMS]], and the move by INFORMS from two meetings each year to one, helped to spur the CMOT group to form a separate society, the North American Association for Computational Social and Organizational Sciences (NAACSOS).  Kathleen Carley was a major contributor, especially to models of social networks, obtaining [[National Science Foundation]] funding for the annual conference and serving as the first President of NAACSOS.  She was succeeded by David Sallach of the [[University of Chicago]] and [[Argonne National Laboratory]], and then by Michael Prietula&lt;ref&gt;[http://goizueta.emory.edu/faculty/academic_areas/isom/prietula_michael.html Michael Prietula]&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Emory University]]. At about the same time NAACSOS began, the [[European Social Simulation Association]] (ESSA) and the Pacific Asian Association for Agent-Based Approach in Social Systems Science (PAAA), counterparts of NAACSOS, were organized.  As of 2013, these three organizations collaborate internationally.  The First World Congress on Social Simulation was held under their joint sponsorship in Kyoto, Japan, in August 2006.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} The Second World Congress was held in the northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C., in July 2008, with [[George Mason University]] taking the lead role in local arrangements.

===2000s and later===

More recently, [[Ron Sun]] developed methods for basing agent-based simulation on models of human cognition, known as [[cognitive social simulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sun |first=Ron |authorlink=Ron Sun |title=Cognition and Multi-Agent Interaction: From Cognitive Modeling to Social Simulation |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=2006 |url=http://www.cambridge.org/uk/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0-521-83964-5 |isbn=978-0-521-83964-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bill McKelvey, Suzanne Lohmann, Dario Nardi, Dwight Read and others at [[UCLA]] have also made significant contributions in organizational behavior and decision-making.  Since 2001, UCLA has arranged a conference at Lake Arrowhead, California, that has become another major gathering point for practitioners in this field.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} In 2014, Sadegh Asgari from [[Columbia University]] and his colleagues developed an agent-based model of the construction competitive bidding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Developing a Virtual Laboratory for Construction Bidding Environment Using Agent-Based Modeling |journal=Journal of Computing in Civil Engineering |date=2014-10-06 |pages=04014105 |volume=29 |issue=6 |doi=10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000440 |first=R. |last=Awwad |first2=S. |last2=Asgari |first3=A. |last3=Kandil}}&lt;/ref&gt; While his model was used to analyze the low-bid lump-sum construction bids, it could be applied to other bidding methods with little modifications to the model.

==Theory==
Most computational modeling research describes systems in [[Steady state|equilibrium]] or as moving between equilibria. Agent-based modeling, however, using simple rules, can result in different sorts of complex and interesting behavior.  The three ideas central to agent-based models are agents as objects, [[emergence]], and [[complexity]].

Agent-based models consist of dynamically interacting rule-based agents. The systems within which they interact can create real-world-like complexity.  Typically agents are
[[situated]] in space and time and reside in networks or in lattice-like neighborhoods. The location of the agents and their responsive behavior are encoded in [[algorithm]]ic form in computer programs.  In some cases, though not always, the agents may be considered as intelligent and purposeful.  In ecological ABM (often referred to as "individual-based models" in ecology), agents may, for example, be trees in forest, and would not be considered intelligent, although they may be "purposeful" in the sense of optimizing access to a resource (such as water).
The modeling process is best described as [[inductive reasoning|inductive]]. The modeler makes those assumptions thought most relevant to the situation at hand and then watches phenomena emerge from the agents' interactions. Sometimes that result is an equilibrium. Sometimes it is an emergent pattern. Sometimes, however, it is an unintelligible mangle.

In some ways, agent-based models complement traditional analytic methods. Where analytic methods enable humans to characterize the equilibria of a system, agent-based models allow the possibility of generating those equilibria. This generative contribution may be the most mainstream of the potential benefits of agent-based modeling. Agent-based models can explain the emergence of higher-order patterns—network structures of terrorist organizations and the Internet, [[power-law distributions]] in the sizes of traffic jams, wars, and stock-market crashes, and social segregation that persists despite populations of tolerant people. Agent-based models also can be used to identify lever points, defined as moments in time in which interventions have extreme consequences, and to distinguish among types of path dependency.

Rather than focusing on stable states, many models consider a system's robustness—the ways that complex systems adapt to internal and external pressures so as to maintain their functionalities. The task of harnessing that complexity requires consideration of the agents themselves—their diversity, connectedness, and level of interactions.

Recent work on the Modeling and simulation of Complex Adaptive Systems has demonstrated the need for combining agent-based and complex network based models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Aditya Kurve |author2=Khashayar Kotobi |author3=George Kesidis |title=An agent-based framework for performance modeling of an optimistic parallel discrete event simulator |journal=Complex Adaptive Systems Modeling |volume=1 |pages=12 |doi=10.1186/2194-3206-1-12 |year=2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Muaz A.

# Complex Network Modeling Level for developing models using interaction data of various system components.
# Exploratory Agent-based Modeling Level for developing agent-based models for assessing the feasibility of further research. This can e.g. be useful for developing proof-of-concept models such as for funding applications without requiring an extensive learning curve for the researchers.
# Descriptive Agent-based Modeling (DREAM) for developing descriptions of agent-based models by means of using templates and complex network-based models. Building DREAM models allows model comparison across scientific disciplines.

The agent-directed simulation (ADS) metaphor distinguishes between two categories, namely "Systems for Agents" and "Agents for Systems."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eng.auburn.edu/~yilmaz/ADS.html |title=Agent-Directed Simulation |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Systems for Agents (sometimes referred to as agents systems) are systems implementing agents for the use in engineering, human and social dynamics, military applications, and others. Agents for Systems are divided in two subcategories. Agent-supported systems deal with the use of agents as a support facility to enable computer assistance in problem solving or enhancing cognitive capabilities. Agent-based systems focus on the use of agents for the generation of model behavior in a system evaluation (system studies and analyses).

==Implementation==

Many agent-based modeling software are designed for serial [[Von Neumann architecture|von-Neumann computer architectures]]. This limits the speed and scalability of these systems. A recent development is the use of data-parallel algorithms on Graphics Processing Units [[GPU]]s for ABM simulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Isaac Rudomin |url=https://sites.google.com/site/rudominisaac/shader-agents |title=Large Crowds in the GPU |year=2006 |publisher=[[Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education]] |accessdate=|display-authors=etal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111054342/https://sites.google.com/site/rudominisaac/shader-agents |archivedate=January 11, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Roshan M. |last=D'Souza |url=http://www.me.mtu.edu/~rmdsouza/ABM_GPU.html |title=Mega-Scale Interactive Agent-Based Model Simulations on the GPU |publisher=[[Michigan Technological University]] |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Paul |last1=Richmond |first2=Daniela M. |last2=Romano |url=http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/~daniela/Paul_abgpu_IWSV_2008.pdf |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090115220835/http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/~daniela/Paul_abgpu_IWSV_2008.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=January 15, 2009 |format=PDF |title=Agent Based GPU, a Real-time 3D Simulation and Interactive Visualisation Framework for Massive Agent Based Modelling on the GPU |journal=Proceedings International Workshop on Super Visualisation (IWSV08) |year=2008 |accessdate=April 27, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The extreme memory bandwidth combined with the sheer number crunching power of multi-processor GPUs has enabled simulation of millions of agents at tens of frames per second.

==Verification and validation==
[[Verification and validation]] (V&amp;V) of simulation models is extremely important.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Sargent |first1=R.

As an example of V&amp;V technique, consider VOMAS (virtual overlay multi-agent system),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Muaz |last1=Niazi |first2=Amir |last2=Hussain |first3=Mario |last3=Kolberg |title=Verification and Validation of Agent-Based Simulations using the VOMAS approach |journal=Proceedings of the Third Workshop on Multi-Agent Systems and Simulation '09 (MASS '09), as Part of MALLOW 09, Sep 7–11, 2009, Torino, Italy |url=http://www.cs.stir.ac.uk/~man/papers/VOMAS_CRV_aug_05_09_Muazv2.pdf |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614052017/http://www.cs.stir.ac.uk/~man/papers/VOMAS_CRV_aug_05_09_Muazv2.pdf |archivedate=June 14, 2011 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; a software engineering based approach, where a virtual overlay multi-agent system is developed alongside the agent-based model. The agents in the multi-agent system are able to gather data by generation of logs as well as provide run-time validation and verification support by watch agents and also agents to check any violation of invariants at run-time. These are set by the Simulation Specialist with help from the SME ([[subject-matter expert]]). Muazi et al. also provide an example of using VOMAS for verification and validation of a forest fire simulation model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Muaz |last1=Niazi |first2=Qasim |last2=Siddique |first3=Amir |last3=Hussain |first4=Mario |last4=Kolberg |title=Verification &amp; Validation of an Agent-Based Forest Fire Simulation Model |journal=Proceedings of the Agent Directed Simulation Symposium 2010, as Part of the ACM SCS Spring Simulation Multiconference |pages=142–149 |date=April 11–15, 2010 |url=http://cs.stir.ac.uk/~man/papers/2_ADS_09_Final_Paper.pdf |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725083937/http://cs.stir.ac.uk/~man/papers/2_ADS_09_Final_Paper.pdf |archivedate=July 25, 2011 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

VOMAS provides a formal way of validation and verification. To develop a VOMAS, one must design VOMAS agents along with the agents in the actual simulation, preferably from the start. In essence, by the time the simulation model is complete, one can essentially consider it to be one model containing two models:
# An agent-based model of the intended system
# An agent-based model of the VOMAS

Unlike all previous work on verification and validation, VOMAS agents ensure that the simulations are validated in-simulation i.e. even during execution. In case of any exceptional situations, which are programmed on the directive of the Simulation Specialist (SS), the VOMAS agents can report them. In addition, the VOMAS agents can be used to log key events for the sake of debugging and subsequent analysis of simulations. In other words, VOMAS allows for a flexible use of any given technique for the sake of verification and validation of an agent-based model in any domain.

Details of validated agent-based modeling using VOMAS along with several case studies are given in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Muaz A. K. |last=Niazi |title=Towards A Novel Unified Framework for Developing Formal, Network and Validated Agent-Based Simulation Models of Complex Adaptive Systems |date=June 11, 2011 |publisher=[[University of Stirling]]|hdl=1893/3365 }} PhD Thesis&lt;/ref&gt; This thesis also gives details of "exploratory agent-based modeling", "descriptive agent-based modeling" and "validated agent-based modeling", using several worked case study examples.

===Complex systems modelling===

Mathematical models of complex systems are of three types: [[black-box]] (phenomenological), [[White box (software engineering)|white-box]] (mechanistic, based on the [[first principles]]) and [[Grey box model|grey-box]] (mixtures of phenomenological and mechanistic models).&lt;ref name="Kalmykov Lev V., Kalmykov Vyacheslav L.

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In black-box models, the individual-based (mechanistic) mechanisms of a complex dynamic system remain hidden. [[File:Mathematical models for complex systems.jpg|thumb|Mathematical models for complex systems]] Black-box models are completely nonmechanistic. They are phenomenological and ignore a composition and internal structure of a complex system. We cannot investigate interactions of subsystems of such a non-transparent model. A white-box model of complex dynamic system has ‘transparent walls’ and directly shows underlying mechanisms. All events at micro-, meso- and macro-levels of a dynamic system are directly visible at all stages of its white-box model evolution. In most cases mathematical modelers use the heavy black-box mathematical methods, which cannot produce mechanistic models of complex dynamic systems. Grey-box models are intermediate and combine black-box and white-box approaches. [[File:Logical deterministic individual-based cellular automata model of single species population growth.gif|thumb|Logical deterministic individual-based cellular automata model of single species population growth]] Creation of a white-box model of complex system is associated with the problem of the necessity of an a priori basic knowledge of the modeling subject. The deterministic logical [[Cellular automaton|cellular automata]] are necessary but not sufficient condition of a white-box model. The second necessary prerequisite of a white-box model is the presence of the physical [[ontology]] of the object under study. The white-box modeling represents an automatic hyper-logical inference from the [[first principle]]s because it is completely based on the deterministic logic and axiomatic theory of the subject. The purpose of the white-box modeling is to derive from the basic axioms a more detailed, more concrete mechanistic knowledge about the dynamics of the object under study. The necessity to formulate an intrinsic [[axiomatic system]] of the subject before creating its white-box model distinguishes the cellular automata models of white-box type from cellular automata models based on arbitrary logical rules. If cellular automata rules have not been formulated from the first principles of the subject, then such a model may have a weak relevance to the real problem.&lt;ref name="Kalmykov Lev V., Kalmykov Vyacheslav L. White-box model" /&gt;

The downhill spiral followed by the final return of a damaged-for-life boy to Rochdale is well handled too. He has a very expressive face."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Guantanamo Boy Theatre Review - WhatsonStage Susan Elkin|url=http://www.whatsonstage.com/london-theatre/reviews/11-2013/guantanamo-boy_32626.html|accessdate=23 August 2016|publisher=WhatsonStage.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Avida''' is an [[artificial life]] software platform to study the [[evolutionary biology]] of [[self-replication|self-replicating]] and [[evolution|evolving]] [[computer program]]s ([[digital organism]]s). Avida is under active development by [[Charles Ofria]]'s Digital Evolution Lab at [[Michigan State University]]; the first version of Avida was designed in 1993 by Ofria, [[Chris Adami]] and C. Titus Brown at [[Caltech]], and has been fully reengineered by Ofria on multiple occasions since then.  The software was originally inspired by the [[Tierra (computer simulation)|Tierra]] system.

== Design principles ==

[[Tierra (computer simulation)|Tierra]] simulated an evolutionary system by introducing computer programs that competed for computer resources, specifically processor (CPU) time and access to main memory. In this respect it was similar to [[Core Wars]], but differed in that the programs being run in the simulation were able to modify themselves, and thereby evolve. Tierra's programs were artificial life organisms.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Unlike Tierra, Avida assigns every digital organism its own protected region of memory, and executes it with a separate virtual [[Central processing unit|CPU]]. By default, other digital organisms cannot access this memory space, neither for reading nor for writing, and cannot execute code that is not in their own memory space.

A second major difference is that the virtual CPUs of different organisms can run at different speeds, such that one organism executes, for example, twice as many instructions in the same time interval as another organism. The speed at which a virtual CPU runs is determined by a number of factors, but most importantly, by the ''tasks'' that the organism performs: logical computations that the organisms can carry out to reap extra CPU speed as bonus.

== Use in research ==

Adami and Ofria, in collaboration with others, have used Avida to conduct research in digital evolution, and the scientific journals ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' and ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' have published four of their papers.

The 2003 paper "The Evolutionary Origin of Complex Features" describes the evolution of a mathematical [[Equality (mathematics)|equal]]s [[operator (programming)|operation]] from simpler bitwise operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lenski|first1=R.

[[File:Baopuzi.JPG|thumb|First Page of ''Baopuzi'' Inner Chapter 9]]
[[File:Laojunfu.gif|thumb|''Laojun rushan fu'' 老君入山符 "Lord [[Laozi|Lao]]'s amulet for entering mountains" from ''Baopuzi'' Inner Chapter 17]]
The '''''Baopuzi''''' ({{zh|s=抱朴子|t=抱朴子|p=Bàopǔzǐ|w=Pao-p'u-tzu|l=[Book of the] Master Who Embraces Simplicity}}), written by the [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin dynasty]] scholar [[Ge Hong]] 葛洪 (283-343), is divided into esoteric ''Neipian'' 內篇 "Inner Chapters" and exoteric ''Waipian'' 外篇 "Outer Chapters". The [[Daoist]] Inner Chapters discuss topics such as techniques for [[Xian (Taoism)|''xian'']] 仙 "immortality; transcendence", [[Chinese alchemy]], elixirs, and demonology. The [[Confucianist]] Outer Chapters discuss [[Chinese literature]], [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], politics, and society.

==Title==
The [[eponymous]] title ''Baopuzi'' derives from Ge Hong's [[Art name|''hao'']] 號 "sobriquet; pseudonym" Baopuzi (lit. "embrace simplicity master"), which compounds ''bao'' [[Wikt:抱|抱]] "embrace; hug; carry; hold in both arms; cherish", ''[[Pu (Daoism)|pu]]'' or [[Wikt:朴|朴]] "uncarved wood, [a [[Taoism#Pu|Daoist metaphor]] for a] person's original nature; simple; plain", and ''zi'' [[Wikt:子|子]] "child; offspring; master [title of respect]". ''Baopu'' is a classical allusion to the ''[[Daodejing]]'' (19, tr. Mair 1990:181), "Evince the plainness of undyed silk, embrace the simplicity of the unhewn log; lessen selfishness, diminish desires; abolish learning and you will be without worries."

Ge Hong's autobiography explains choosing his [[pen name]] Baopuzi.
&lt;blockquote&gt;It has been my plan to preserve regularity and not to follow the whims of the world. My speech is frank and sincere; I engage in no banter. If I do not come upon the right person, I can spend the day in silence. This is the reason my neighbors call me Simplex (''Pao-p'u''), which name I have used as a sobriquet in my writings. (tr. Ware 1966:10) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Compare these autobiography translations: (Davis and Ch'en 1941:301) "people all call me a ''pao-p'u'' scholar (i.e., one who keeps his basic nature, one who is unperturbed by the desires of the world)"; (Sailey 1978:251) "among the people of his district there were those who called him "The Scholar Who Embraces Simplicity"."  Wu and Davis (1935:224) noted, "This name has been translated ''Old Sober-Sides'', but Dr. Wu considers that it has no satirical intent and would better be translated ''Solemn-Seeming Philosopher''." Fabrizio Pregadio (2006:2) translates "Master Who Embraces Spontaneous Nature".

==History==
Compared with many other Daoist texts, the origins of the ''Baopuzi'' are well documented. Ge completed the book during the Jianwu 建武 era (317–318), when [[Emperor Yuan of Jin]] founded the Eastern Jin Dynasty, and revised it during the Xianhe 咸和 era (326-334).

Ge Hong's autobiography (Outer Chapter 50) records writing the ''Baopuzi''.
&lt;blockquote&gt;In my twenties I planned to compose some little things in order not to waste my time, for it seemed best to create something that would constitute the sayings of one sole thinker. This is when I outlined my philosophical writing, but it was also the moment when I became involved in armed rebellion and found myself wandering and scattered even farther afield, some of my things getting lost. Although constantly on the move, I did not abandon my brush again for a dozen or so years, so that at the age of 37 or 38 [A.D. 317-18] I found my work completed. In all, I have composed ''Nei p'ien'' in 20 scrolls, ''Wai p'ien'' in 50; … [list of other writings, totaling 310 scrolls] My ''Nei p'ien'', telling of gods and genii, prescriptions and medicines, ghosts and marvels, transformations, maintenance of life, extension of years, exorcising evils, and banishing misfortune, belongs to the Taoist school. My ''Wai p'ien'', giving an account of success and failure in human affairs and of good and evil in public affairs, belongs to the Confucian school. (tr. Ware 1966:17, cf. Sailey 1978:264)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Compare the more literal translation of Davis and Ch'en (1941:301), "I left off writing for ten and odd years, for I was constantly on the road, until the era Chien-wu 建武 (317-318 A.D.) when I got it ready."

Ge's autobiography mentions his military service fighting rebels against the Jin Dynasty, and successfully defending his hometown of Jurong 句容 (in modern [[Zhenjiang]], [[Jiangsu]]). In 330 (tr. Ware 1966:20), [[Emperor Cheng of Jin]] granted Ge the fief of "Marquis of [[Guanzhong]]" with income from 200 Jurong households. Scholars believe Ge revised the ''Baopuzi'' during this period, sometime around 330 (Komjathy 2004:22) or 332 (Wu and Davis 1935:224).

The ''Baopuzi'' consists of 70 ''pian'' 篇 "chapters; books" divided between the 20 "Inner Chapters" and 50 "Outer Chapters" (cf. the ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]'' textual division). [[Nathan Sivin]] (1969:389) described it as "not one book but two, considerably different in theme". The ''Neipian'' and ''Waipian'' "led entirely separate physical existences; they were not combined under a single title until a millennium after Ko's time".

The (1444–1445) [[Ming Dynasty]] ''[[Daozang]]'' "Daoist canon" first printed the two ''Baopuzi'' parts together. This ''Zhengtong Daozang'' 正統道藏 "Daoist Canon of the [[Zhengtong Emperor|Zhengtong]] Era (1436-1450)" bibliographically categorized the ''Baopuzi'' under the ''Taiqing'' 太清 "Supreme Clarity" section for alchemical texts. ''Daozang'' editions encompass six ''juan'' (卷 "scrolls; fascicles; volumes"), three each for the Inner and Outer Chapters. Most received versions of ''Baopuzi'' descend from this Ming ''Daozang'' text.

==Content==
The ''Baopuzi'' Inner and Outer Chapters discuss miscellaneous topics ranging from [[esotericism]] to [[social philosophy]]. The Inner Chapters discuss techniques of [[Xian (Taoism)|''xian'']] 仙 "immortality; transcendence", [[Chinese alchemy]], meditation, [[Daoist yoga]], [[Daoyin]], [[Taoist sexual practices|sexual techniques]], [[Chinese herbology]], demons, and [[Fulu|''fu'']] 符 "magic talismans". The Outer Chapters discuss [[Chinese philosophy]], [[Confucianism]], [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], government, politics, literature, scholarship, and include Ge's autobiography, which Waley (1930:10) called "the fullest document of this kind that early China produced".

According to Ge Hong's autobiography, he divided the Inner and Outer Chapters on the distinction between [[Daoism]] and [[Confucianism]]. Ge philosophically described Daoism as the ''ben'' 本 "root; trunk; origin" and Confucianism as the ''mo'' 末 "tip; branch; end" (Inner Chapter 10, tr. Ware 1966:165). When asked, "Which has the priority, Confucianism or Taoism?" – Baopuzi replies, "Taoism is the very trunk of Confucianism, but Confucianism is only a branch of Taoism."

While the ''Baopuzi'' Inner and Outer Chapters differ in content, they share a general format with an unnamed interlocutor posing questions and Ge Hong providing answers. The conventional syntax is ''Huowen yue'' 或問曰 "Someone asked, saying" and ''Baopuzi da yue'' 抱樸子答曰 "Baopuzi answered, saying".

===Inner Chapters===
The twenty ''Neipian'' "Inner Chapters" record arcane techniques for achieving ''xian'' "transcendence; immortality". These techniques span two types of Chinese alchemy that [[Tang Dynasty]] scholars later differentiated into ''[[neidan]]'' 內丹 "internal elixir; internal alchemy" and ''[[waidan]]'' 外丹 "external elixir; external alchemy". The word ''dan'' [[Wikt:丹|丹]] "[[cinnabar]]; red; pellet; [Chinese medicine] pill" means  "[[Pill of Immortality|pill of immortality]], or [[elixir of life]]. Ge Hong details his researches into the arts of transcendence and immortality. "Internal alchemy" concerns creating an "immortal body" within the corporeal body through both physiological methods (dietary, respiratory, sexual, etc.) and mental practices (meditation, visualization, etc.). "External" or "laboratory alchemy" concerns compounding elixirs (esp. from minerals and metals), writing ''fu'' talismans or amulets, herbalism, and exorcism.

Lai outlines the Inner Chapters subjects:
&lt;blockquote&gt; (1) proofs of the ''per se'' existence of immortals and transcendent states of immortality of the body; (2) stipulation of the accessibility to the perfect state of long life to everyone, irrespective of one's social status but dependent on whether one could study deeply and strenuously cultivate the necessary esoteric methods; (3) elaboration of diverse esoteric techniques leading one to become a ''hsien''-immortal; and (4) descriptions and criticism of the diverse contemporary Taoist discourses and sects. (1998:191-2) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Several chapters have specific themes. Chapters 4, 8, 11, and 16 describe ''waidan'' "external alchemy". Inner Chapter 18 details meditation practices. In Chapter 19, Ge Hong praises his master Zheng Yin 鄭隱 (ca. 215-ca. 302), catalogues Daoist books, and lists talismans (see Ware 1966:379-385).

Many scholars have praised the Inner Chapters. [[Joseph Needham]] (1954:437), who called Ge Hong "the greatest alchemist in Chinese history", quoted the following passage about medicines from different biological categories.
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Interlocutor'': Life and death are predetermined by fate and their duration is normally fixed. Life is not something any medicine can shorten or lengthen. A finger that has been cut off cannot be joined on again and expected to continue growing. Blood from a wound, though swallowed, is of no benefit. Therefore, it is most inappropriate to approve of taking such nonhuman substances as pine or thuya [cypress] to protract the brief span of life. &lt;br&gt;
''Ko'': According to your argument, a thing is beneficial only if it belongs to the same category as that which is treated. … If we followed your suggestion and mistrusted things of a different type, we would be obliged to crush flesh and smelt bone to prepare a medicine for wounds, or to fry skin and roast hair to treat baldness. Water and soil are not of the same substance as the various plants; yet the latter rely upon them for growth. The grains are not of the same species as living men; yet living men need them in order to stay alive. Fat is not to be classed with fire, nor water with fish, yet when there is no more fat the fires dies, and when there is no more water, fish perish. (3, tr. Ware 1966:61-62) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Needham (1954:439) evaluated this passage, "Admittedly there is much in the ''Pao Phu Tzu'' which is wild, fanciful and superstitious, but here we have a discussion scientifically as sound as anything in Aristotle, and very much superior to anything which the contemporary occident could produce."

In addition to quoting early alchemical texts, the Inner Chapters describe Ge Hong's laboratory experiments. Wu and Davis mention  the ''Baopuzi'' formula for making [[mosaic gold]] "a golden crystalline powder used as a pigment" from ''chiyan'' 赤塩 "red crystal salt" (produced from [[amethyst]], [[calcite]] [[crystal]], and [[alum]]; Ware 1966:273) and ''huizhi'' 灰汁 "[[limewater]]".
&lt;blockquote&gt;The description of one process deserves special discussion, for it evidently concerns the preparation of stannic sulfide or "mosaic gold" and is perhaps the earliest known description of the preparation of this interesting substance. Mosaic gold exists in flakes or leaflets which have the color and the luster of gold, it does not tarnish, and is used at present for bronzing radiators, gilding picture frames and similar purposes. As Ko Hung describes the process, "tin sheets, each measuring six inches square by one and two-tenths inches thick, are covered with a one-tenth inch layer of a mud-like mixture of ''Ch'ih Yen'' (Red Salt) and ''Huei Chih'' (potash-water, limewater), ten pounds of tin to every four of ''Ch'ih Yen''." They are then heated in a sealed earthenware pot for thirty days with horse manure (probably with a smouldering fire of dried manure). "All the tin becomes ash like and interspersed with bean-like pieces which are the yellow gold." The large portion of the metallic tin is converted into some ash-like compound or possibly into the ash-like allotropic modification, gray tin. A small portion of the tin is converted into bean-sized aggregates of flaky stannic sulfide. The yield is poor, for the author says that "twenty ounces of gold are obtained from every twenty pounds of tin used." (1935:232) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The authors add, "It seems likely that Ko Hung was personally experienced in the chemistry of tin, for the Chinese say that he was the first to make [[tin foil]] and that he made magic or spirit money out of it."

===Outer Chapters===
The fifty ''Waipian'' "Outer Chapters" are more diffuse than the Inner ones. Ge Hong diversely wrote essays on Jin Dynasty issues in philosophy, morality, politics, and society. This ''Baopuzi'' portion details everyday problems among Han Dynasty northerners who fled into south China after the fall of [[Luoyang]].

Some of the Outer Chapters are thematically organized. Ge Hong wrote chapters 46, 47, and 48 to dispute three adversaries. Guo Tai 郭太 (128-169) founded of the ''[[Qingtan]]'' "pure conversation" school; Ni Heng 禰衡 (173-198) was an infamously arrogant official of [[Cao Cao]]; and [[Pao Ching-yen|Bao Jingyan]] 鮑敬言 (ca. 405-ca. 466) was an early anarchist philosopher.

==Translations==
The Chinese ''Baopuzi'' has been translated into English, Italian, German, and Japanese. There are more English translations of the twenty Inner Chapters than the fifty Outer Chapters.

The Inner Chapters have several partial translations. Tenney L. Davis, professor of organic chemistry at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], collaborated on first translations of the Inner Chapters relevant to the [[history of alchemy]]. Wu and Davis (1935) translated chapters 4 "On the Gold Medicine" and 16 "On the Yellow and White" (i.e., gold and silver). Davis and Ch'en (1941) translated chapters 8 "Overcoming Obstructions" and 11 "On ''hsien'' Medicines", and provided paraphrases or summaries of the remaining Inner Chapters. The French sinologist Eugene Feifel made English translations of chapters 1-3 (1941), 4 (1944), and 11 (1946). More recently, excerpts from the Inner Chapters are quoted by Verellen (1999) and Pregadio (2006).

The Inner Chapters have one complete translation by James R. Ware (1966), which also includes Ge Hong's autobiography from Outer Chapter 50 (1966:6-21). Several reviewers censured the quality of Ware's translation, for instance, Kroll (1982:139) called it "at times misguided". Huard's and Wong's (1968) critical assessment of Ware was criticized in turn by Sivin (1969:388). "Their review, nonetheless, can only be described as perfunctory. Only the forematter and endmatter of Ware's book are evaluated, and that in a curiously cursory fashion."

Translating the fundamental Daoist word ''[[Tao|Dao]]'' or ''Tao'' "way; path; principle" as English ''[[God]]'' is a conspicuous peculiarity of Ware's ''Baopuzi'' version. The Introduction gives a convoluted Christian justification, first quoting J.J.L. Duyvendak's translation of ''[[Daodejing]]'' 25, "Its rightful name I do not know, but I give It the sobriquet ''Tao'' (= God). If a rightful name is insisted upon, I would call It Maximal." 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Then, upon noticing that ''Tao Te Ching'', verse 34, is willing to call the Something "Minimal," every schoolman would have understood that the Chinese author was talking about God, for only in God do contraries become identical! Accordingly, the present translator will always render this use of the term Tao by ''God''. In doing so, he keeps always in mind as the one and only definition the equation establishable from ''Exod''. 3:13-15 and ''Mark'' 12:26-27, to mention only two very clear statements. It will be recalled that in the first God says, "My name is I am, I live, I exist," while the second reads, "God is not of the dead but of the living." Therefore, God = Life or Being. (1966:1-2) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Ware admitted his ''God'' for ''Dao'' translation cannot be applied consistently.
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is clear that the word ''tao'' appears frequently in this text not as a designation of God but of the process by which God is to be approximated or attained. In such cases I shall translate it as "the divine process." In instances where either this or "God" would be appropriate, a translator is obliged to be arbitrary. The term ''tao shih'' is rendered "processor"; ''hsien'' is translated "genie" rather than "immortal". (1966:3) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
These Chinese words are ''daoshi'' [[Wikt:道士|道士]] "Daoist priest; Daoist practitioner" and [[Xian (Taoism)|''xian'']] [[Wikt:仙|仙]] "immortal; transcendent". Ho Peng-Yoke, an authority in the [[History of science and technology in China]], criticized Ware's mistranslations. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;It may be true that in certain areas the concept of Tao overlaps with the definition and attributes of God, or for that matter with those of Allah, for example oneness and eternity. However, there is the danger of the analogy being pushed too far. Similarly, the reader might be warned that "Genii," as used for rendering the word ''hsien'', does not convey the concept of some supernatural slaves as found in the lamp and the ring of the ''Thousand-and-One Nights''. The reviewer prefers the terminology used by Tenny L. Davis, i.e. ''Tao'' left untranslated and "immortal" for ''hsien''. (1967:145) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Nevertheless, Ho's review concluded with praise. "Professor Ware is to be congratulated for bringing out the translation of a most difficult Chinese Taoist text in a very readable form. One cannot find another text that gives so much useful and authoritative information on alchemy and Taoism in fourth-century China."

Ge Hong wrote the ''Baopuzi'' in elegant [[Classical Chinese grammar]] and terminology, but some Inner Chapter contexts are difficult to translate. Comparing three versions of this passage listing ''xian'' medicines illustrates the translational choices.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The best ''hsien'' medicine is cinnabar. Others in the order of decreasing excellence are gold, silver, ''chih'', the five jades, mica, pearl, realgar, ''t'ai i yü yü liang'', ''shih chung huang tzu'' 石中黄子 (literally yellow nucleus in stone), ''shih kuei'' 石桂 (stony cinnamon), quartz, ''shih nao'' 石腦, ''shih liu huang'' 石硫黄 (a kind of raw sulfur), wild honey and ''tseng ch'ing''. (11, tr. Davis and Ch'en 1941:311) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Medicines of superior quality for immortality are: cinnabar; next comes gold, then follows silver, then the many ''chih'', then the five kinds of jade, then mica, then ''ming-chu'', then realgar, then brown hematite, then conglomerate masses of brown hematite, then stone cassia (?), then quartz, then paraffin, then sulphur, then wild honey, then malachite (stratified variety) (tr. Feifel 1946:2) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;At the top of the genie's pharmacopoeia stands cinnabar. Second comes gold; third, silver, fourth, excresences; fifth, the jades; sixth, mica; seventh, pearls; eighth, realgar; ninth, brown hematite; tenth, conglomerated brown hematite; eleventh, quartz; twelfth, rock crystal; thirteenth, geodes; fourteenth, sulphur; fifteenth, wild honey; and sixteenth, laminar malachite. (tr. Ware 1966:178) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Baoppuzi'' Outer Chapters have one partial translation into English. Jay Sailey (1978) translated 21 of the 50 chapters: 1, 3, 5, 14-15, 20, 24-26, 30-34, 37, 40, 43-44, 46-47, and 50. In addition, Sailey (1978:509-545) included appendices on "Buddhism and the ''Pao-p'u-tzu''", "Biography of Ko Hung" from the ''[[Jin Shu]]'', and "Recensions" of lost ''Baopuzi'' fragments quoted in later texts. Kroll (1982:139) gave a mixed review, "Although Sailey's renderings frequently obscure Ko Hung's carefully polished diction and nuance, they reliably convey the sense of the original and should be a substantial boon to Western students of medieval Chinese thought and culture."

==Significance==
For centuries, traditional scholars have revered the ''Baopuzi'' as a canonical Daoist scripture – but in recent years, modern scholars have reevaluated the text.

Traditional scholarship viewed the ''Baopuzi'', especially the Inner Chapters, as a primary textual source for early Chinese ''waidan'' "external alchemy". Wu and Davis described it as, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;probably the widest known and highest regarded of the ancient Chinese treatises on alchemy. It has been preserved for us as part of the Taoist canon. It shows us the art matured by five or six centuries of practice, having its traditional heroes and an extensive literature, its technique and philosophy now clearly fixed, its objectives and pretentions established. This art the author examines in a hardheaded manner and expounds in language which is remarkably free from subterfuge. (1935:221) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Arthur Waley]] praised Ge Hong's rational attitude toward alchemy.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Nowhere in Pao P'u Tzu's book do we find the hierophantic tone that pervades most writings on alchemy both in the East and in the West. He uses a certain number of secret terms, such as 金公 "metal-lord" and 河車 "river chariot", both of which mean lead; and 河上她女 "the virgin on the river", which means mercury … But his attitude is always that of a solidly educated layman examining claims which a narrow-minded orthodoxy had dismissed with contempt. (1930:13) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
In the estimation of Ho (1967:145), the ''Baopuzi'' is a "more important" alchemical text than [[Wei Boyang]]'s (ca. 142) ''[[Cantong qi]]'' 參同契 "The Kinship of the Three". The ''Baopuzi'' mentions a ''Neijing'' 內經 "Inner Classic" by Wei Boyang, but curiously does not mention Wei's ''Cantong ji''.

Modern scholarship has taken another look at the ''Baopuzi''. Sivin demeans the text's significance.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Inner Chapters are anything but the writings of a Taoist man of wisdom or organizer for his disciples or for other initiates. This book is a vast trove of commonplaces and hearsay about popular beliefs in which Ko's few incontestably Taoist texts play an essential but small part. Its goal is not to catalogue, synthesize, or provide a handbook of techniques. It is rather a dialogue in which Ko hurls scattershot against a skeptical anonymous interlocutor. The Inner Chapters are a one-issue book. Ko seeks to convince his questioner, and thereby his readers, that immortality is a proper object of study and is attainable – not only by the ancients but in his own time, not only by a destined few but by anyone with enough faith to undertake arduous and dangerous disciplines. The devotion that Ko calls for implies wholesale acceptance of legends, myths, tales of prodigies, magical beliefs, religious faiths – practically every belief current in the popular imagination of Ko's time and the inverse in almost every sense of what "fundamentalist Confucian" humanists considered worthy of thought (but then they were no longer setting the intellectual style). (1978:345) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Sivin sarcastically compares Ge Hong, "an obsessed bookman and indiscriminate lore-collector", with [[Alan Watts]]. "Ko's style was rather than of a pedantic purveyor of occultism to the upper class. I can only think of him as the Alan Watts of his time."  However, James Benn (2003:139) observes, "This judgement is perhaps not as damning as Professor Sivin intended. Certainly, one would not now go to Watts in the hope of learning much about Taoism, but a close study of his work would tell us a great deal about perceptions and presuppositions concerning Asian religions in mid-twentieth century America. Like Watts and others of his generation it is true that Ge Hong did see religion as a personal matter, and he seems to have approached it from the point of view of a fan or enthusiast more than as an initiate."

Chi-Tim Lai (1998:199) interprets the Inner Chapters as a "new discourse" on ''xian''-immortality through personal salvation and perfection, contrasting with the traditional "imperial discourse" that only the rich could afford ''xian''-hood. For example, histories record that both [[Qin Shi Huang]] and [[Emperor Wu of Han]] dispatched imperial naval expeditions to obtain the "elixir of immortality" from mythical [[Mount Penglai]]. "That is, an individual's self-perfection is only dependent upon ascetic, mystic, and ethical behavior. Since it is a new religious discourse supposedly open to all people, the quest for a prolonged life is no longer the preserve of the wealthy and powerful."
&lt;blockquote&gt;According to Ko Hung, the ''hsien''-immortals who can achieve the complete avoidance of death rarely come from the social groups of worthies, emperors, or sages. Hence, he implies that ''hsien''-immortality are distinctive "human" ideal values to be pursued and potentially achieved by anyone. In the first, in order to differentiate the ideal values of ''hsien''-immortal from this worldly worthies and powers, Ko Hung says, "Those who attained immortal were almost all poor and lowly. They were not men of position and power."' Second, in placing the ideal of ''hsien''-immortality out of the reach of imperial figures, Ko Hung rebukes emperors such as the First Emperor of the Ch'in and Emperor Han-wu-ti, who were "models" of seeking for immortality in ancient Chinese history and literature, by saying, "These two emperors had a hollow reputation for wanting immortality, but they never experienced the reality of cultivating the Tao." (Lai 1998:210) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ge Hong quotes his teacher Zheng Yin explaining that poverty forces ''daoshi'' "Daoist practitioners" seeking ''xian'' techniques to engage in the difficulties and dangers of alchemy.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Then I asked further, "Why should we not eat the gold and silver which are already in existence instead of taking the trouble to make them? What are made will not be real gold and silver but just make-believes."

Said Cheng Chun in reply, "The gold and silver which are found in the world are suitable for the purpose. But ''Tao-shih'' are all poor; witness the adage that ''Hsien'' are never stout and ''Tao-shih'' never rich. ''Tao-shih'' usually go in groups of five or ten, counting the teacher and his disciples. Poor as they are, how can they be expected to get the necessary gold and silver? Furthermore they cannot cover the great distances to gather the gold and silver which occur in nature. The only thing left for them to do is to make the metals themselves". (16, tr. Wu and Davis 1935:260-1) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Ware (1966:268) translates this adage, "There are no fat genii and no rich processors".

For a wealthy person seeking ''xian''-transcendence, Ge Hong recommends compounding ''jinye'' 金液 (lit. "gold liquid/fluid") "golden liquor" in a ''huachi'' 花池 (lit. "flower pond") "a vinegar solvent" (fortified with [[saltpeter]]; Ware 1966:347). This is simpler to produce than traditional ''jiuding'' 九鼎 "nine tripods" elixirs (attributed to the [[Yellow Emperor]]), but expensive – eight doses cost 400,000 [[Cash (Chinese coin)|cash]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;True it is that the nine medicines are the best of ''Hsien'' medicines. Yet the materials for their compounding are quite numerous. They are easily procurable only in large cities which have good facilities for communication, but are not to be obtained at other places. Furthermore, in the compounding of the medicines, the fires should be tended for tens of days and nights with industrious application and close adjustment, which is a great difficulty. The compounding of the Gold Fluid is much easier. There the only thing which is difficult is to get the gold. One pound in the old measure is equivalent to two in our contemporary measure. Such a quantity of gold would cost only some three hundred thousand cash. The other auxiliary materials are easy to procure. In the compounding, no fire is required. All that needs to be done is to have the mixture in a ''Hua Ch'ih'' (Flower Pond) for the necessary number of days. A total expenditure of four hundred thousand cash will make an amount large enough to transform eight persons into ''Hsien''. Just as no wine is formed by the fermentation of small quantities of rice, so small quantities of materials will not be able to interact to give the medicine. (4, tr. Wu and Davis 1935:251) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Pregadio (2006:215) says recent studies show Ge's intent was "glorifying the religious and ritual legacy of [[Jiangnan]] 江南 (the region south of the lower Yangzi River), emphasizing the superiority of certain traditions over others, and enhancing their prestige among the social elite to which Ge Hong belonged." Nonetheless, Pregadio concludes, &lt;blockquote&gt;Ge Hong's testimony deserves attention as a valuable overview of the religious traditions of Jiangnan just before the Way of the Celestial Masters ([[Tianshi dao]]) spread to that area, soon followed by the [[Shangqing School|Shangqing]] and [[Lingbao School|Lingbao]] revelations. From this point of view, the ''Baopu zi'' documents important links between the earlier and later history of Taoism, as it also does for medicine and other fields. (2006:217) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''birthday effect''' (sometimes called the '''birthday blues''', especially when referring specifically to [[suicide]]) is a statistical phenomenon where an individual's likelihood of death appears to increase on or close to their [[birthday]]. The birthday effect has been seen in studies of general populations in [[England and Wales]],&lt;ref name="E&amp;W"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Relationship between month of birth and month of death in the elderly|first1=M|last1=Anderson|journal=British Journal of Preventive &amp; Social Medicine|year=1975|volume=29|issue=3|pages=151–156|pmc=478908|pmid=1191883}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Switzerland]],&lt;ref name="Swiss1992"&gt;{{cite journal|title=[Mortality and birthdays]|first1=J|last1=Bovet|first2=J|last2=Spagnoli|first3=C|last3=Sudan|journal=Sozial-und Praventivmedizin|year=1997|volume=42|issue=3|pages=151–161|pmid=9334087|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Swiss2008"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Death has a preference for birthdays—an analysis of death time series|first1=Vladeta|last1=Ajdacic-Gross|display-authors=etal|journal=Annals of Epidemiology|year=2012|volume=22|issue=8|pages=603–606|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S104727971200110X|doi=10.1016/j.annepidem.2012.04.016|pmid=22658822}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ukraine]],&lt;ref name="Ukraine"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Variation of mortality rate during the individual annual cycle|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/9087987|first1=Alexander|last1=Vaiserman|first2=Pavel|last2=Grigoryev|first3=Irina|last3=Belaya|first4=Vladimir|last4=Voitenko|journal=Biogerontology|year=2003|volume=4|issue=4|pages=221–225|doi=10.1023/A:1025168932058}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[United States]],&lt;ref name="California"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Birthday: Lifeline or Deadline?|first1=David|last1=Phillips|first2=Camilla|last2=Van Voorhees|first3=Todd|last3=Ruth|journal=Psychosomatic Medicine|year=1992|volume=54|issue=5|pages=532–542|url=http://journals.lww.com/psychosomaticmedicine/Abstract/1992/09000/The_birthday__lifeline_or_deadline__.1.aspx|doi=10.1097/00006842-199209000-00001|citeseerx=10.1.1.103.5726}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="USA"&gt;{{cite journal|title=A not so happy day after all: Excess death rates on birthdays in the U.S|first1=Pablo|last1=Peña|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|year=2015|volume=126|pages=59–66|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953614008120|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2014.12.014|pmid=25528555}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in smaller populations such as [[Major League Baseball]] players.&lt;ref name="MLB"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Mortality Salience of Birthdays on Day of Death in the Major Leagues|first1=Ernest|last1=Abel|first2=Michael|last2=Kruger|journal=Death Studies|year=2009|volume=33|issue=2|pages=175–184|doi=10.1080/07481180802138936|pmid=19143110}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies do not consistently show this effect; some studies find that men's and women's mortality rates diverge in the run-up to the birthday,&lt;ref name="California"/&gt; while others find no [[statistical significance|significant]] gender effect.&lt;ref name="Austria"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Longevity and month of birth: Evidence from Austria and Denmark|first1=Gabrielle|last1=Doblhammer|journal=Demographic Research|year=1999|volume=1|issue=3|url=http://www.demographic-research.org/Volumes/Vol1/3/default.htm|doi=10.4054/DemRes.1999.1.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Germany"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Deaths and major biographical events: a study of all cancer deaths in Germany from 1995 to 2009|first1=Daniel|last1=Medenwald|first2=Oliver|last2=Kuss|journal=BMJ Open|year=2014|volume=4|issue=4|url=http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/4/4/e004423.long|doi=10.1136/bmjopen-2013-004423|pmid=24694623|pmc=3987729|pages=e004423}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suggested mechanisms for the effect include alcohol consumption, psychological stress relating to the birthday, increased suicide risk, terminally ill patients attempting to hold on until their birthday, an increased [[mortality salience]], or a physiological cycle that causes the body to weaken annually. It has also been suggested that it may be a statistical artifact, perhaps as a result of anomalies in reporting, but the birthday effect has also been seen in studies that control for known reporting anomalies.&lt;ref name="California"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MLB"/&gt;

==Studies==
[[File:GabbyHartnettGoudeycard.jpg|thumb|left|[[Gabby Hartnett]] is one of the statistically unusual number of [[MLB]] players to have died on his birthday.&lt;ref name="MLB"/&gt;]]
With the introduction of statistical software that can process large datasets easily, a number of state- or country-wide studies have been carried out to investigate whether birthdays have any effect on mortality. The first large-scale study used the records of 2,745,149 Californians who died between 1969 and 1990. After correcting for confounding factors such as [[seasonality]] in deaths, elective surgery, and people born on [[February 29]], there was a significant increase in deaths in the week before the individual's birthday for men, and in the week after the birthday for women – in both cases, mortality did not peak on the birthday, but close to it. This effect was consistent across age and race cohorts.&lt;ref name="California"/&gt;

A similar study among 12,275,033 Swiss found the highest mortality on the actual birthday (17% greater than the expected value), and the effect was largest for those over 80;&lt;ref name="Swiss1992"/&gt; another study on Swiss data found a 13.8% excess and was able to link this to specific causes: [[heart attack]] and [[stroke]] (predominant in women) and suicides and accidents (predominant in men), as well as an increase in cancer deaths.&lt;ref name="Swiss2008"/&gt; Among 25 million Americans who died between 1998 and 2011, 6.7% more people than expected die on their birthday, and the effect was most pronounced at weekends and among the young – among 20 to 29 year olds, the excess was over 25%.&lt;ref name="USA"/&gt; An even greater excess was found in the population of Kiev, where between 1990 and 2000 there were 44.4% more deaths than expected among men on their birthdays and 36.2% more than expected among women.&lt;ref name="Ukraine"/&gt; Smaller biographical studies have also shown a birthday effect within subpopulations, such as among Major League Baseball (MLB) players&lt;ref name="MLB"/&gt; and people with entries in the ''Encyclopedia of American History''.&lt;ref name="California"/&gt;

Focusing on suicide deaths alone, large studies have found evidence for a peak in suicides on or just after a birthday in [[Denmark]]&lt;ref name="Denmark"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Postponed Suicide Death? Suicides around Birthdays and Major Public Holidays|first1=Gert|last1=Jessen|first2=Børge|last2=Jensen|journal=Suicide and Life-Threatening Behavior|year=1999|volume=29|issue=3|pages=272–283|doi=10.1111/j.1943-278X.1999.tb00302.x|doi-broken-date=2018-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hungary]],&lt;ref name="Hungary"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Effect of Birthday on the Fluctuation of Suicides in Hungary (1970–2002)|first1=Tamás|last1=Zonda|first2=Károly|last2=Bozsonyi|first3=Előd|last3=Veres|first4=Zoltán|last4=Kmetty|journal=Review of Sociology|year=2010|volume=20|issue=2|pages=96–105|url=http://www.szociologia.hu/dynamic/revsoc_2010_2_96_105_bozsonyi.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; but not in [[Bavaria]]&lt;ref name="Bavaria"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The myth of the birthday blues: a population-based study about the association between birthday and suicide|first1=Udo|last1=Reulbach|first2=Teresa|last2=Biermann|first3=Katrin|last3=Markovic|first4=Johannes|last4=Kornhuber|first5=Stefan|last5=Bleich|journal=Comprehensive Psychiatry|year=2007|volume=48|issue=6|pages=554–557|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010440X07000867|doi=10.1016/j.comppsych.2007.06.006|pmid=17954141}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Taiwan]].&lt;ref name="Bavaria"/&gt;

However, other studies have not found such a correlation. A study using the populations of Denmark and [[Austria]] (a total of 2,052,680 deaths over the time period) found that although people's life span tended to correlate with their month of birth, there was no consistent birthday effect, and people born in autumn or winter were more likely to die in the months further from their birthday.&lt;ref name="Austria"/&gt; A study of all cancer deaths in Germany from 1995 to 2009 found no evidence of a birthday effect, although it did find a related Christmas effect.&lt;ref name="Germany"/&gt; A small study by [[Leonard Zusne]] found birthday effects among both male and female cohorts, where women were more likely to die immediately before a birthday and men more likely to die immediately after, but that when averaged together there was no birthday effect among the population as a whole.&lt;ref name="Zusne"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Some Factors Affecting the Birthday-Deathday Phenomenon|first1=Leonard|last1=Zusne|journal=Omega: Journal of Death and Dying|year=1987|volume=17|issue=1|pages=9–26|url=http://ome.sagepub.com/content/17/1/9.short|doi=10.2190/RR4D-4W0L-5QAK-X4YX}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same was found for a study of mortality data in England and Wales, where there was a statistically significant birthday effect among each subgroup (men and women; never married, married, divorced and widowed) but [[Simpson's paradox|it was not seen in the population as a whole]].&lt;ref name="E&amp;W"/&gt;

==Possible explanations==

===External causes===
Birthday celebrations are often associated with large increases in alcohol consumption. [[Binge drinking]] can [[Alcohol and health|increase an individual's risk of death]] through [[alcohol poisoning]], accidents and [[drunk driving]], as well as by exacerbating existing conditions and increasing suicide risk.&lt;ref name="Ukraine"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hungary"/&gt; In the USA where the drinking age is 21, there is a very large mortality rate excess on the 21st birthday and the day immediately following, almost entirely attributable to an increase in accidents.&lt;ref name="alcohol"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Effect of Alcohol Consumption on Mortality: Regression Discontinuity Evidence from the Minimum Drinking Age|journal=American Economic Journal: Applied Economics|date=1 January 2009|volume=1|issue=1)|pages=164–182|first1=Christopher|last1=Carpenter|first2=Carlos|last2=Dobkin|doi=10.1257/app.1.1.164|pmid=20351794|pmc=2846371}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="alcoholappendix"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Effect of Alcohol Consumption on Mortality: Regression Discontinuity Evidence from the Minimum Drinking Age (Web Appendix A and B)|journal=American Economic Journal: Applied Economics|date=1 January 2009|first1=Christopher|last1=Carpenter|first2=Carlos|last2=Dobkin|url=https://assets.aeaweb.org/assets/production/articles-attachments/aej/app/app/2007-0089_app.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychosomatic and psychological===
{{see also|Mortality salience}}
Two mutually contradictory explanations have been put forward that rely on [[psychosomatic]] effects. On the one hand, a birthday provides a fixed date to focus on, allowing the terminally ill to hold on until the day itself. On the other hand, a birthday also reminds the individual of mortality and offers an occasion to look back on life.&lt;ref name="California"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/22/news/birthdays-a-matter-of-life-and-death.html|first1=Sandra|last1=Blakeslee|title=Birthdays: a Matter Of Life and Death|newspaper=New York Times|date=22 September 1992|accessdate=7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[terror management theory]], this causes stress which can accelerate death. The uneven mortality rate distribution between men and women, and between more and less successful baseball players, suggests that both may play a role in the birthday effect: people who have focused on the [[public sphere]] of life (for example, [[career]]-driven people or professional athletes) might be reminded that their glory days have passed, while those who lived more in the [[private sphere]] (such as stay-at-home parents and amateur sports players) are more aware of what they will lose in death and try to hold on.&lt;ref name="California"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MLB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; Related is the "broken promise effect", whereby a person suffering [[suicidal ideation]] will wait until a birthday or other significant event to see whether their circumstances will improve.&lt;ref name="Hungary"/&gt;

The psychosomatic/psychological model would also explain the similar increase in cancer deaths around holidays such as [[Christmas]],&lt;ref name="Germany"/&gt; and is supported by the fact that these appear to be dependent on culture – there is a [[Passover]] effect among the Jewish community (which moves [[Passover#Date and duration|with the festival itself]]), and a [[Mid-Autumn Festival]] effect among the Chinese.&lt;ref name="California"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

===Physiological===
It has been suggested that, like the 24-hour [[circadian rhythm]], the body also has a yearly "circannual" [[biological rhythm]]. Vaiserman et al. have suggested that the climatic conditions at birth act as a [[zeitgeber]] that triggers internal stress and increases the chance of death.&lt;ref name="Ukraine"/&gt;

===Statistical===
It is possible when processing [[death certificate]]s to confuse the date of birth and date of death fields, which would increase the apparent number of certificates in which these coincide.&lt;ref name="California"/&gt; Additionally, where the exact date is not known, the 1st and 15th of the month are often used as placeholders.&lt;ref name="Heaping"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Heaping in Anniversary Reaction Studies: A Cautionary Note|first1=Ernest|last1=Abel|first2=Michael|last2=Kruger|journal=Omega: Journal of Death and Dying|year=2006|volume=54|issue=1|pages=59–65|url=http://ome.sagepub.com/content/54/1/59.short|doi=10.2190/V752-6773-1KMW-3334}}&lt;/ref&gt; These will cause an excess of births and deaths recorded on these dates. However studies also find changes in the mortality rate in the days immediately before and after (which are unlikely to be caused by data processing anomalies), which suggests that statistical artifacts alone cannot explain the birthday effect.&lt;ref name="California"/&gt;

'''Blue Zones''' are regions of the world where [[Dan Buettner]] claims people live much longer than average. The term first appeared in the November 2005 ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' magazine cover story "The Secrets of a Long Life" by Buettner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0511/feature1/|title=Longevity, The Secrets of Long Life - National Geographic Magazine|website=ngm.nationalgeographic.com|access-date=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; He identified five areas where: [[Okinawa Prefecture|Okinawa]] ([[Japan]]); [[Sardinia]] ([[Italy]]); [[Nicoya Peninsula|Nicoya]] ([[Costa Rica]]); [[Icaria]] ([[Greece]]) and among the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]] in [[Loma Linda, California]]. He offers an explanation, based on data and first hand observations, as to why these populations live healthier and longer lives. The term "Blue Zones" is [[trademarked]] by Dan Buettner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=This Adventurer Discovered The Secrets To Long Life — And It Could Save Iowa $16 Billion By 2016 |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/dan-buettner-blue-zone-iowa-2012-8 |accessdate=5 November 2018 |work=Business Insider}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept grew out of demographic work done by Gianni Pes and [[Michel Poulain]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

As the two men zeroed in on the cluster of villages with the highest longevity, they drew concentric blue circles on the map and began referring to the area inside the circle as the Blue Zone. Together with demographers Pes and [[Michel Poulain|Poulain]], Buettner broadened the term, applying it to validated longevity areas of Okinawa, Japan and among the Seventh-day Adventists in Loma Linda, California.  Buettner and [[Michel Poulain|Poulain]], under the aegis of National Geographic, then identified and validated longevity hotspots in Nicoya, Costa Rica and Icaria, Greece.

'''Elisa Aaltola''' (born 1976) is a Finnish [[philosopher]], specialised in animal philosophy, moral psychology and environmental philosophy.

She was a visiting PhD student at the Institute for Ethics, Environment, and Public Policy at [[Lancaster University]] and submitted her doctoral thesis to the [[University of Turku]] on ''Animal Individuality: Moral and Cultural Categorisations''. Her book ''Eläinten moraalinen arvo'' (Vastapaino 2004) is considered the first commercially published Finnish monograph dedicated solely to animal ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordanimalethics.com/who-we-are/fellows/|title=Elisa Aaltola|publisher=Oxford Animal Ethics|accessdate=15 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is also the author of ''Animal Suffering: Philosophy and Culture'' (Palgrave MacMillan, 2012) and ''[https://rowman.com/ISBN/9781786606112/Varieties-of-Empathy-Moral-Psychology-and-Animal-Ethics Varieties of Empathy: Moral Psychology and Animal Ethics]'' (Rowman &amp; Littlefield Int. 2018) as well as around 35 peer-reviewed papers. Her edited volumes include "Animal Ethics and Philosophy: Questioning the Orthodoxy" (co-edited with John Hadley, Rowman &amp; Littlefield Int. 2014).  Aaltola is an adjunct professor at the [[University of Turku]] and a senior research fellow at the [[University of Eastern Finland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uef.fi/polle/tutkijat |title=Tutkijat |publisher=University of Eastern Finland |accessdate=15 July 2012 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14161">An '''enantiopure drug''' is a pharmaceutical that is available in one specific [[enantiomer]]ic form. Most biological molecules (proteins, sugars, etc.) are present in only one of many [[chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] forms, so different enantiomers of a chiral drug molecule bind differently (or not at all) to target [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]s. One enantiomer of a drug may have a desired beneficial effect while the other may cause serious and undesired side effects, or sometimes even beneficial but entirely different effects.&lt;ref name=Ariens&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Ariëns |first1= E. J. |year= 1984 |title= Stereochemistry, a basis for sophisticated nonsense in pharmacokinetics and clinical pharmacology |url= http://www.springerlink.com/content/ng657086x6u73p44/ |journal= European Journal of Clinical Pharmacology |volume= 26 |issue= 6 |pages= 663–668 |doi= 10.1007/BF00541922 |pmid=6092093}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Advances in industrial chemical processes have made it economical for pharmaceutical manufacturers to take drugs that were originally marketed as a racemic mixture and market the individual enantiomers, either by specifically manufacturing the desired enantiomer or by [[chiral resolution|resolving]] a [[racemic mixture]]. On a case-by-case basis, the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) has allowed single enantiomers of certain drugs to be marketed under a different name than the racemic mixture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm122883.htm US FDA's policy statement on the development of new stereoisomeric drugs]&lt;/ref&gt; Also case-by-case, the United States Patent Office has granted patents for single enantiomers of certain drugs. The regulatory review for marketing approval (safety and efficacy) and for patenting (proprietary rights) is independent, and differs country by country.

==Importance==
''Selectivity'' is a very important part of organic synthesis. In scientific papers regarding synthesis, selectivity is often listed in data tables alongside percent yield and other reaction conditions. While selectivity is deemed important in scientific literature, it has been challenging to effectively implement selectivity in drug development and production. A major issue with selectivity in [[pharmaceuticals]] is that a large percentage of drug syntheses by nature are not selective reactions, racemic mixtures are formed as the products. Separating racemic mixtures into their respective enantiomers takes extra time, money, and energy. One way to separate enantiomers is to chemically convert them into species that can be separated: diastereomers. Diastereomers, unlike enantiomers, have entirely different physical properties—boiling points, melting points, NMR shifts, solubilities—and they can be separated by conventional means such as [[chromatography]] or [[recrystallization (chemistry)|recrystallization]]. This is a whole extra step in the synthesis process and not desirable from a manufacturing standpoint.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chemhelper.com/enantiomersep.html Separation of Enantiomers http://www.chemhelper.com/enantiomersep.html. Retrieved 2016-04-13.]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, a number of pharmaceuticals are synthesized and marketed as a racemic mixture of enantiomers in cases where the less-effective enantiomer is benign. However, by identifying and specifically purifying the enantiomer which effectively binds to its respective [[binding site]] in the body, less of the drug would be needed to achieve the desired effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Owens|first1=Michael|title=Stereochemistry in Drug Action|pages=70–73|language=English|pmc=353039|pmid=15156233|volume=5|issue=2|journal=Prim Care Companion J Clin Psychiatry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criteria==

According to the FDA, the stereoisomeric composition of a chiral drug should be known, and its effects should be well-characterized from pharmacologic, toxicologic, and clinical standpoints. In order to profile the different stereoisomers of enantiopure drugs, manufacturers are urged to develop quantitative assays for individual enantiomers in ''in vivo'' samples early in the development stage.

Ideally, the main pharmacologic activities of the isomers should be compared in ''in vitro'' systems in animals. During instances when toxic findings are present beyond the natural extensions of the pharmacologic effects of the drug, toxicologic evaluation of the individual isomers in question must be completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm122883.htm|title=Guidances (Drugs) - Development of New Stereoisomeric Drugs|last=Research|first=Center for Drug Evaluation and|website=www.fda.gov|language=en|access-date=2016-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Patenting==

When drugs are covered under patent protection, only the pharmaceutical company that holds the patent is allowed to manufacture, market, and eventually profit from them. The lifetime of the patent varies between countries and also between drugs; in the United States, most drug patents last about twenty years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/ucm079031.htm|title=Development &amp; Approval Process (Drugs) - Frequently Asked Questions on Patents and Exclusivity|last=Research|first=Center for Drug Evaluation and|website=www.fda.gov|language=en|access-date=2016-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the patent has expired, the drug can be manufactured and sold by other companies - at which point, it is referred to as a [[generic drug]]. Its availability on the market as a generic drug removes the monopoly of the patent holder, thereby encouraging competition and causing a significant drop in drug prices, which ensures that life-saving and important drugs reach the general population at fair prices. However, the company holding the initial patent may get a new patent by forming a new version of the drug that is significantly changed compared to the original compound.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.news-medical.net/health/Drug-Patents-and-Generics.aspx|title=Drug Patents and Generic Pharmaceutical Drugs|website=News-Medical.net|access-date=2016-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patentability of different isomers has been controversial over the past ten years and there have been a number of related legal issues. In making their determinations, courts have looked at factors including: (i) whether the racemate was known in the prior art; (ii) the difficulty in resolving the enantiomer; (iii) the [[stereoselectivity]] of the relevant receptor; and (iv) other secondary considerations of non-obviousness such as commercial success, unexpected results, and satisfaction of long-felt needs in the art. The decisions made regarding these issues have varied and there is no clear answer to the legality of patenting stereoisomers. These issues have been resolved on a case-by-case basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sodikoff|first1=Brian|title=Enantiomer Patents: Innovative or Obvious?|url=https://www.kattenlaw.com/files/52074_Enantiomer_Patents_Innovative_or_Obvious.pdf|website=Kattenlaw|accessdate=16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the number of current pharmaceuticals currently being marketed as [[racemic mixture]]s, it is likely that patentability will continue to be debated in the near future.

The following are cases where the individual enantiomers have markedly different effects:
[[File:Thalidomide-racemate2DCSD.svg|thumb|400px|The ''S'' enantiomer causes birth defects, while the ''R'' enantiomer is effective against morning sickness.]]
*[[Thalidomide]]: Thalidomide is racemic. One enantiomer is effective against [[morning sickness]], whereas the other is [[teratology|teratogenic]]. However, the enantiomers are converted into each other ''[[in vivo]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Clin. Pharmacokinet. |year= 2004 |volume= 43 |issue= 5 |pages= 311–327 |title= Clinical pharmacokinetics of thalidomide |pmid= 15080764 |vauthors=Teo SK, Colburn WA, Tracewell WG, Kook KA, Stirling DI, Jaworsky MS, Scheffler MA, Thomas SD, Laskin OL |doi= 10.2165/00003088-200443050-00004}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, dosing with a single-enantiomer form of the drug will still lead to both the enantiomers eventually being present in the patient's serum and thus would not prevent adverse effects—at best, it might reduce them if the rate of [[prodrug|''in vivo'' conversion]] can be slowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Silas|title=Chiral Toxicology: It's the Same Thing...

*[[Ethambutol]]: Whereas the (''S'',''S'')-(+)-enantiomer is used to treat [[tuberculosis]], the (''R'',''R'')-(–)-ethambutol causes blindness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Padmanabhan|first1=Deepak|title=A review of drug isomerism and its significance|pages=16–18|doi=10.4103/2229-516X.112233|pmid=23776834|pmc=3678675|volume=3|issue=1|journal=Int J Appl Basic Med Res}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Positive enantiomer of ethambutol.png|thumbnail|Enantiomer of ethambutol used to treat tuberculosis|left]]
[[File:Negative enantiomer of ethambutol.png|thumbnail|Enantiomer of ethambutol that causes blindness|left]]

*[[Naproxen]]: (''S'')-(+)-naproxen is used to treat arthritis pain, but (''R'')-(–)-naproxen causes liver poisoning with no analgesic effect.
*[[Steroid]] receptor sites also show [[stereoisomerism|stereoisomer]] specificity.
*[[Penicillin]]'s activity is stereodependent. The antibiotic must mimic the &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-alanine chains that occur in the cell walls of bacteria in order to react with and subsequently inhibit bacterial transpeptidase enzyme.
*[[Propranolol]]: &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-propranolol is a powerful [[adrenoceptor antagonist]], whereas &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-propranolol is not. However, both have [[local anesthetic]] effect.
*Methorphan: The &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-isomer of methorphan, [[levomethorphan]], is a potent opioid analgesic, while the &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-isomer, [[dextromethorphan]], is a dissociative cough suppressant.
*[[Carvedilol]]: (''S'')-(–)-isomer interacts with [[adrenoceptor]]s with 100 times greater potency as [[beta blocker|β adrenoreceptor blocker]] than (''R'')-(+)-isomer. However, both the isomers are approximately equipotent as [[alpha blocker|α adrenoreceptor blockers]].
*[[Amphetamine]] and [[methamphetamine]]: The &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-isomers of these drugs are strong central nervous system (CNS) stimulants, while the &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-isomers lack appreciable CNS stimulant effects, but instead stimulate the peripheral nervous system. For this reason, the &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-isomer of methamphetamine is available as an over-the-counter nasal inhaler in some countries, while the &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-isomer is banned from medical use in all but a few countries in the world, and highly regulated in those countries which do allow it to be used medically.

'''Essentialism''' is the view that every [[entity]] has a set of attributes that are necessary to its [[Identity (philosophy)|identity]] and function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cartwright|first=Richard L.|title=Some Remarks on Essentialism|journal=The Journal of Philosophy|year=1968|volume=65|issue=20|pages=615–626|jstor=2024315|doi=10.2307/2024315}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early Western thought [[Platonic idealism|Plato's idealism]] held that all things have such an "essence"—an [[Theory of Forms|"idea" or "form"]]. In [[Categories (Aristotle)|''Categories'']], Aristotle similarly proposed that all objects have a [[Substance theory|substance]] that, as [[George Lakoff]] put it "make the thing what it is, and without which it would be not ''that'' kind of thing".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Janicki|2003|p=274}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contrary view—[[non-essentialism]]—denies the need to posit such an "essence'".

Essentialism has been controversial from its beginning. Plato, in the ''[[Parmenides (dialogue)|Parmenides Dialogue]]'', depicts Socrates questioning the notion, suggesting that if we accept the idea that every beautiful thing or just action partakes of an essence to be beautiful or just, we must also accept the "existence of separate essences for hair, mud, and dirt" .&lt;ref name="platostanford"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plato-parmenides/|title=Plato's Parmenides|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=[[Stanford University]]|date=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In biology and other natural sciences, essentialism provided the rationale for [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] at least until the time of [[Charles Darwin]];&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Ereshefsky|2007|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; the role and importance of essentialism in biology is still a matter of debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Hull|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[gender studies]] the essentialist idea that men and women are fundamentally different continues to be a matter of contention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Fausto-Sterling|first=Anne|title=Myths of Gender: Biological Theories about Women and Men|publisher=Basic Books|year=1992|isbn=978-0465047925}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Suzanne Kelly 2011"&gt;Suzanne Kelly, Gowri Parameswaran, and Nancy Schniedewind, ''Women: Images &amp; Realities: A Multicultural Anthology'', 5th ed., McGraw-Hill, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In philosophy==
An ''[[essence]]'' characterizes a [[substance theory|substance]] or a [[Substantial form|form]], in the sense of the forms and ideas in [[Platonic idealism]]. It is permanent, unalterable, and eternal, is and present in every possible world. Classical [[humanism]] has an essentialist conception of the human, in its endorsement of the notion of an eternal and unchangeable [[human nature]]. This has been criticized by [[Kierkegaard]], [[Marx]], [[Heidegger]], [[Sartre]], and many other [[Existentialism|existential]] and [[Historical materialism|materialist]] thinkers.

In [[Plato]]'s philosophy (in particular, the ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' and the ''[[Philebus]]''), things were said to come into being by the action of a [[demiurge]] who works to form [[substance theory|chaos]] into ordered entities. Many definitions of ''essence'' hark back to the ancient Greek [[hylomorphic]] understanding of the formation of the things. According to that account, the structure and real existence of any thing can be understood by analogy to an artefact produced by a craftsperson. The craftsperson requires ''hyle'' (timber or wood) and a model, plan or idea in her own mind, according to which the wood is worked to give it the indicated contour or form (''morphe''). Aristotle was the first to use the terms ''hyle'' and ''morphe''. According to [[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|his explanation]], all entities have two aspects: "matter" and "form". It is the particular form imposed that gives some matter its identity—its [[quiddity]] or "whatness" (i.e., its "what it is").

Plato was one of the first essentialists, postulating the concept of ideal forms—an [[abstract entity]] of which individual objects are mere facsimiles. To give an example: the ideal form of a circle is a perfect circle, something that is physically impossible to make manifest; yet the circles we draw and observe clearly have some ''idea'' in common—the ideal form. Plato proposed that these ideas are eternal and vastly superior to their manifestations, and that we understand these manifestations in the material world by comparing and relating them to their respective ideal form. Plato's forms are regarded as patriarchs to essentialist dogma simply because they are a case of what is intrinsic and a-contextual of objects—the abstract properties that makes them what they are. (For more on forms, read [[Plato's allegory of the cave|Plato's parable of the cave]].)

[[Karl Popper]] splits the ambiguous term ''[[Philosophical realism|realism]]'' into ''essentialism'' and ''realism''. He uses ''essentialism'' whenever he means the opposite of [[nominalism]], and ''realism'' only as opposed to [[idealism]]. Popper himself is a realist as opposed to an idealist, but a methodological nominalist as opposed to an essentialist. For example, statements like "a puppy is a young dog" should be read from right to left, as an answer to "What shall we call a young dog"; never from left to right as an answer to "What is a puppy?"&lt;ref&gt;''The Open Society and its Enemies'', passim.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metaphysical essentialism===
Essentialism, in its broadest sense, is any philosophy that acknowledges the primacy of ''essence''. Unlike [[existentialism]], which posits "being" as the fundamental reality, the essentialist [[wikt:ontology|ontology]] must be approached from a metaphysical perspective. Empirical knowledge is developed from experience of a relational universe whose components and attributes are defined and measured in terms of intellectually constructed laws. Thus, for the scientist, reality is explored as an evolutionary system of diverse entities, the order of which is determined by the principle of causality.

[[Plato]] believed that the universe was perfect and that its observed imperfections came from man's limited perception of it. For Plato, there were two realities: the "essential" or ideal and the "perceived". [[Aristotle]] (384–322 B.C.) applied the term ''essence'' to that which things in a category have in common and without which they cannot be members of that category (for example, ''rationality'' is the essence of man; without rationality a creature cannot be a man). In his critique of Aristotle's philosophy, [[Bertrand Russell]] said that his concept of essence transferred to metaphysics what was only a verbal convenience and that it confused the properties of language with the properties of the world. In fact, a thing's "essence" consisted in those defining properties without which we could not use the ''name'' for it.&lt;ref name=russell&gt;Bertrand Russell, ''A History of Western Philosophy'', London: Routledge, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; Although the concept of essence was "hopelessly muddled" it became part of every philosophy until modern times.&lt;ref name=russell/&gt;

The Egyptian-born philosopher [[Plotinus]] (204–270 CE) brought [[idealism]] to the [[Roman Empire]] as [[Neoplatonism]], and with it the concept that not only do all existents emanate from a "primary essence" but that the mind plays an active role in shaping or ordering the objects of perception, rather than passively receiving empirical data.

Despite the metaphysical basis for the term, academics in science, [[aesthetics]], [[heuristics]], [[psychology]], and gender-based sociological studies have advanced their causes under the banner of essentialism. Possibly the clearest definition for this philosophy was offered by gay/lesbian rights advocate [[Diana Fuss]], who wrote: "Essentialism is most commonly understood as a belief in the real, true essence of things, the invariable and fixed properties which define the 'whatness' of a given entity."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Fuss|2013|p=xi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metaphysical essentialism stands diametrically opposed to existential realism in that finite existence is only differentiated appearance, whereas "ultimate reality" is held to be absolute essence.

Among contemporary essentialists, what all existing things have in common is ''the power to exist'', which defines their "uncreated" Essence.&lt;ref&gt;Levina, Tatiana (Moscow 2013) Realism in Metaphysics: Analytic Questions and Continental Answers (p. 23)&lt;/ref&gt;

==In mathematics==
In 2010, an article by [[Gerald B. Folland]] in the ''[[Notices of the American Mathematical Society]]'' stated, "It is a truth universally acknowledged that almost all mathematicians are Platonists, at least when they are actually doing mathematics …" This refers to their implicit embrace of essentialism, which he finds revealed in mathematicians peculiar use of language. Whereas physicists define [[Lie algebra]] as a rule they can apply to facts, mathematicians define it as an essence of a structure, independent of any circumstance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/notices/201009/rtx100901121p.pdf Gerald B. Folland, October 2010, Notices of the AMS, p. 1121 "Speaking with the Natives: Reﬂections on Mathematical Communication"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In psychology==
[[File:Toronto Maple Leafs bild.JPG|thumb|right|220px|[[Paul Bloom (psychologist)|Paul Bloom]] attempts to explain why people will pay more in an auction for the clothing of celebrities if the clothing is unwashed. He believes the answer to this and many other questions is that people cannot help but think of objects as containing a sort of "essence" that can be influenced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ted.com/talks/paul_bloom_the_origins_of_pleasure.html Paul Bloom, July 2011 Ted talk, "The Origins of Pleasure"]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
There is a difference between metaphysical essentialism (see above) and psychological essentialism, the latter referring not to an actual claim about the world but a claim about a way of representing entities in cognitions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Medin|first=D. L.|title=Conceptes and conceptual structure|journal=American Psychologist|year=1989|volume=44|issue=12|pages=1469–1481|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.44.12.1469}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Medin, 1989). Influential in this area is [[Susan Gelman]], who has outlined many domains in which children and adults construe classes of entities, particularly biological entities, in essentialist terms—i.e., as if they had an immutable underlying essence which can be used to predict unobserved similarities between members of that class.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Gelman, S. ''The essential child: Origins of essentialism in everyday thought''. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Toosi|first=N.

This causal relationship is unidirectional; an observable feature of an entity does not define the underlying essence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dar-Nimrod|first=I.|author2=Heine, S. J.|title=Genetic essentialism: On the deceptive determinism of DNA|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=2011|volume=137|issue=5|pages=800–818|doi=10.1037/a0021860|pmid=21142350|pmc=3394457}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Dar-Nimrod &amp; Heine, 2011).

===In developmental psychology===
Essentialism has emerged as an important concept in psychology, particularly [[developmental psychology]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gelman|first=S. A.|author2=Kremer, K. E.|title=Understanding natural causes: Children's explanations of how objects and their properties originate|journal=Child Development|year=1991|volume=62|issue=2|pages=396–414|doi=10.2307/1131012|pmid=2055130|jstor=1131012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gelman and Kremer (1991) studied the extent to which children from 4–7 years old demonstrate essentialism. Children were able to identify the cause of behaviour in living and non-living objects. Children understood that underlying essences predicted observable behaviours. Participants could correctly describe living objects' behaviour as self-perpetuated and non-living objects as a result of an adult influencing the object's actions. This is a biological way of representing essential features in cognitions. Understanding the underlying causal mechanism for behaviour suggests essentialist thinking&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rangel|first=U.|author2=Keller, J.|title=Essentialism goes social: Belief in social determinism as a component of psychological essentialism|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2011|volume=100|issue=6|pages=1056–1078|doi=10.1037/a0022401|pmid=21319911}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Rangel and Keller, 2011).
Younger children were unable to identify causal mechanisms of behaviour whereas older children were able to. This suggests that essentialism is rooted in [[cognitive development]]. It can be argued that there is a shift in the way that children represent entities, from not understanding the causal mechanism of the underlying essence to showing sufficient understanding&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Demoulin|first=Stéphanie|last2=Leyens |first2=Jacques-Philippe |last3=Yzerbyt |first3=Vincent|title=Lay Theories of Essentialism |journal=Group Processes &amp; Intergroup Relations|year=2006|volume=9|issue=1|pages=25–42|doi=10.1177/1368430206059856}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Demoulin, Leyens &amp; Yzerbyt, 2006).

There are four key criteria which constitute essentialist thinking. The first facet is the aforementioned individual causal mechanisms (del Rio &amp; Strasser, 2011). The second is innate potential: the assumption that an object will fulfill its predetermined course of development&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kanovsky|first=M.|title=Essentialism and folksociology: Ethnicity again|journal=Journal of Cognition and Culture|year=2007|volume=7|issue=3–4|pages=241–281|doi=10.1163/156853707X208503|citeseerx=10.1.1.411.7247}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Kanovsky, 2007). According to this criterion, essences predict developments in entities that will occur throughout its lifespan. The third is immutability&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Holtz|first=P.|author2=Wagner, W.|title=Essentialism and attribution of monstrosity in racist discourse: Right-wing internet postings about africans and jews|journal=Journal of Community &amp; Applied Social Psychology|year=2009|volume=19|issue=6|pages=411–425|doi=10.1002/casp.1005}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Holtz &amp; Wagner, 2009). Despite altering the superficial appearance of an object it does not remove its essence. Observable changes in features of an entity are not salient enough to alter its essential characteristics. The fourth is inductive potential&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Birnbaum|first=D.|author2=Deeb, I. |author3=Segall, G. |author4=Ben-Eliyahu, A. |author5=Diesendruck, G. |title=The development of social essentialism: The case of Israeli children's inferences about Jews and Arabs |journal=Child Development |year=2010 |volume=81|issue=3|pages=757–777|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624-2010.01432.x|pmid=20573103|doi-broken-date=2018-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Birnbaum, Deeb, Segall, Ben-Aliyahu &amp; Diesendruck, 2010). This suggests that entities may share common features but are essentially different. However similar two beings may be, their characteristics will be at most analogous, differing most importantly in essences.

The implications of psychological essentialism are numerous. Prejudiced individuals have been found to endorse exceptionally essential ways of thinking, suggesting that essentialism may perpetuate exclusion among social groups&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morton|first=T. A.|author2=Hornsey, M. J. |author3=Postmes, T. |title=Shifting ground: The variable use of essentialism in contexts of inclusion and exclusion|journal=British Journal of Social Psychology|year=2009|volume=48|issue=1|pages=35–59|doi=10.1348/014466607X270287|pmid=18171502}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Morton, Hornsey &amp; Postmes, 2009). This may be due to an over-extension of an essential-biological mode of thinking stemming from cognitive development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Medin | first1 = D.L. | last2 = Atran | first2 = S. | year = 2004 | title = The native mind: biological categorization and reasoning in development and across cultures | doi = 10.1037/0033-295x.111.4.960 | pmid = 15482069 | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 111 | issue = 4| pages = 960-83 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Bloom (psychologist)|Paul Bloom]] of Yale University has stated that "one of the most exciting ideas in cognitive science is the theory that people have a default assumption that things, people and events have invisible essences that make them what they are. Experimental psychologists have argued that essentialism underlies our understanding of the physical and social worlds, and developmental and cross-cultural psychologists have proposed that it is instinctive and universal. We are natural-born essentialists."&lt;ref&gt;Bloom. P. (2010) Why we like what we like. ''Observer''. 23 (8), 3 [http://www.psychologicalscience.org/index.php/publications/observer/2010/october-10/why-we-like-what-we-like.html online link].&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars suggest that the categorical nature of essentialist thinking predicts the use of stereotypes and can be targeted in the application of stereotype prevention&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bastian|first=B.|author2=Haslam, N.|title=Psychological essentialism and stereotype endorsement|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|year=2006|volume=42|issue=2|pages=228–235|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2005.03.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Bastian &amp; Haslam, 2006).

==In ethics==
Classical essentialists claim that some things are wrong in an absolute sense. For example murder breaks a universal, objective and natural moral law and not merely an advantageous, socially or ethically constructed one.

Many modern essentialists claim that right and wrong are moral boundaries that are individually constructed; in other words, things that are ethically right or wrong are actions that the individual deems to be beneficial or harmful, respectively.

==In biology==

One possibility is that before [[evolution]] was developed as a [[scientific theory]], there existed an essentialist view of [[biology]] that posited all species to be unchanging throughout time. The historian Mary P. Winsor has argued that biologists such as [[Louis Agassiz]] in the 19th century believed that taxa such as species and genus were fixed, reflecting the mind of the creator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bowler |first1=Peter J. |title=Evolution. The History of an Idea |date=1989 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-06386-0 |page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[creation-evolution controversy|religious opponents of evolution]] continue to maintain this view of biology.

Recent work by historians of [[systematics|systematic biology]] has, however, cast doubt upon this view of pre-Darwinian thinkers. Winsor, Ron Amundson and Staffan Müller-Wille have each argued that in fact the usual suspects (such as [[Linnaeus]] and the Ideal Morphologists) were very far from being essentialists, and it appears that the so-called "essentialism story" (or "myth") in biology is a result of conflating the views expressed by philosophers from [[Aristotle]] onwards through to [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[William Whewell]] in the immediately pre-Darwinian period, using biological examples, with the use of terms in biology like species.&lt;ref&gt;Amundson, R. (2005) ''The changing rule of the embryo in evolutionary biology: structure and synthesis'', New York, Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-80699-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Müller-Wille | first1=Staffan | year=2007 | title=Collection and collation: theory and practice of Linnaean botany | journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part C: Studies in History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences | volume=38 | issue=3| pages=541–562 | doi=10.1016/j.shpsc.2007.06.010| pmid=17893064 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Winsor | first1=M.

== Gender essentialism ==
{{main|Gender essentialism}}

In [[feminist theory]] and [[gender studies]], '''gender essentialism''' is the attribution of a fixed essence to women. Women's essence is assumed to be universal and is generally identified with those characteristics viewed as being specifically feminine.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; These ideas of femininity are usually biologized and are often preoccupied with psychological characteristics, such as nurturance, empathy, support, and non-competitiveness, etc. Feminist theorist [[Elizabeth Grosz]] states in her 1995 publication ''Space, time and perversion: essays on the politics of bodies'' that essentialism "entails the belief that those characteristics defined as women's essence are shared in common by all women at all times. It implies a limit of the variations and possibilities of change—it is not possible for a subject to act in a manner contrary to her essence. Her essence underlies all the apparent variations differentiating women from each other. Essentialism thus refers to the existence of fixed characteristic, given attributes, and ahistorical functions that limit the possibilities of change and thus of social reorganization."&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Grosz|first1 = Elizabeth|title =Space, Time, and Perversion: Essays on the Politics of Bodies |date = 1995|publisher = Routledge|location = New York|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Space_Time_and_Perversion.html?id=Htf7y-rcVFwC |deadurl=no |accessdate=17 March 2017|isbn = 9780415911375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender essentialism is pervasive in popular culture, as illustrated by the #1 ''New York Times'' best seller ''[[Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus]]'',&lt;ref&gt;John Gray, ''Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus'', HarperCollins, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; but this essentialism is routinely critiqued in introductory women studies textbooks such as ''Women: Images &amp; Realities''.&lt;ref name="Suzanne Kelly 2011"/&gt;

Starting in the 1980s, some feminist writers have put forward essentialist theories about gender and science. [[Evelyn Fox Keller]],&lt;ref&gt;Evelyn Fox Keller, ''Reflections on Gender and Science'', Yale University Press, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sandra Harding]],
&lt;ref&gt;Sandra Harding, ''The Science Question in Feminism'', Cornell University Press, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nancy Tuana]]
&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Tuana, ''The Less Noble Sex'', Indiana University Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; argued that the modern scientific enterprise is inherently patriarchal and incompatible with women's nature.  Other feminist scholars, such as [[Ann Hibner Koblitz]],&lt;ref&gt;Ann Hibner Koblitz, "A historian looks at gender and science," ''International Journal of Science Education'', vol. 9 (1987), p. 399-407.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lenore Blum]],&lt;ref&gt;Lenore Blum, "AWM's first twenty years: The presidents' perspectives," in Bettye Anne Case and Anne M. Leggett, eds., ''Complexities: Women in Mathematics'', Princeton University Press, 2005, p. 94-95.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mary Gray (scholar)|Mary Gray]],&lt;ref&gt;Mary Gray, "Gender and mathematics: Mythology and Misogyny," in Gila Hanna, ed., ''Towards Gender Equity in Mathematics Education: An ICMI Study'', Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Mary Beth Ruskai,&lt;ref&gt;Mary Beth Ruskai, "Why women are discouraged from becoming scientists," ''The Scientist'', March 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; and Pnina Abir-Am and Dorinda Outram&lt;ref&gt;Pnina Abir-Am and Dorinda Outram, "Introduction," ''Uneasy Careers and Intimate Lives: Women in Science, 1789-1979'', Rutgers University Press, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; have criticized those theories for ignoring the diverse nature of scientific research and the tremendous variation in women's experiences in different cultures and historical periods.

== In historiography ==
Essentialism in history as a field of study entails discerning and listing essential cultural characteristics of a particular nation or culture, in the belief that a people or culture can be understood in this way. Sometimes such essentialism leads to claims of a praiseworthy national or cultural identity, or to its opposite, the condemnation of a culture based on presumed essential characteristics. [[Herodotus]], for example, claims that Egyptian culture is essentially feminized and possesses a "softness" which has made Egypt easy to conquer.&lt;ref&gt;DeLapp 177.&lt;/ref&gt; To what extent Herodotus was an essentialist is a matter of debate; he is also credited with not essentializing the concept of the Athenian identity,&lt;ref&gt;Lape 149-52.&lt;/ref&gt; or differences between the Greeks and the Persians that are the subject of his ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Gruen 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Essentialism had been operative in [[colonialism]] as well as in critiques of colonialism.

[[Postcolonialism|Post-colonial]] theorists such as [[Edward Said]] insisted that essentialism was the "defining mode" of "Western" historiography and ethnography until the nineteenth century and even after, according to [[Touraj Atabaki]], manifesting itself in the historiography of the Middle East and Central Asia as [[Eurocentrism]], over-generalization, and reductionism.&lt;ref&gt;Atabaki 6-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most historians reject essentialism because it "dehistoricizes the process of social and cultural changes" and tends to see non-Western societies as historically unchanging; in India this led to the anti-essentialist (even anti-historiographical) school of [[Subaltern Studies]].&lt;ref&gt;Atabaki 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of human artifacts being given life has fascinated humankind for as long as people have been recording their myths and stories.  Whether [[Pygmalion (mythology)|Pygmalion]] or [[Frankenstein]], humanity has been fascinated with the idea of [[artificial life]].

== Pre-computer ==

[[Automaton]]s were quite a novelty.  In the days before computers and electronics, some were very sophisticated, using [[pneumatics]], [[mechanics]], and [[hydraulics]]. The first automata were conceived during the third and second centuries BC and these were demonstrated by the theorems of [[Hero of Alexandria]], which included sophisticated mechanical and hydraulic solutions.&lt;ref&gt;Droz, Edmond. (April 1962), From joined doll to talking robot, New Scientist, vol. 14, no. 282. pp. 37-40.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of his notable works were included in the book ''Pneumatics'', which was also used for constructing machines until early modern times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Synthetic Biology Analysed: Tools for Discussion and Evaluation|last=Engelhard|first=Margret|publisher=Springer|year=2016|isbn=9783319251431|location=Cham|pages=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1490, Leonardo Da Vinci also constructed an armored knight, which is considered the first humanoid robot in Western civilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to Mobile Robot Control|last=Tzafestas|first=Spyros|publisher=Elsevier|year=2014|isbn=9780124170490|location=Waltham, MA|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other early famous examples include [[al-Jazari]]'s [[humanoid robot]]s. This Arabic inventor once constructed a band of automata, which can be commanded to play different pieces of music.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science Year by Year , Dorling Kindersley, 2013: Science Year by Year|last=Winston|first=Robert|publisher=DK|year=2013|isbn=9781409316138|location=London|pages=334}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also the case of [[Jacques de Vaucanson]]'s [[digesting Duck|artificial duck]] exhibited in 1735, which had thousands of moving parts and one of the first to mimic a biological system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cellular Automaton Modeling of Biological Pattern Formation: Characterization, Examples, and Analysis, 2nd edition|last=Deutsch|first=Andreas|publisher=Birkhäuser|year=2018|isbn=9781489979780|location=New York|pages=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; The duck could reportedly eat and digest, drink, quack, and splash in a pool.  It was exhibited all over Europe until it fell into disrepair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nyu.edu/pages/linguistics/courses/v610051/gelmanr/ling.html| title=Gallery of Automata| accessdate=2006-03-03| first=Rony| last=Gelman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it wasn't until the invention of cheap computing power that [[artificial life]] as a legitimate science began in earnest, steeped more in the theoretical and computational than the mechanical and mythological.

==1950s&amp;ndash;1970s==
One of the earliest thinkers of the modern age to postulate the potentials of artificial life, separate from [[artificial intelligence]], was math and computer prodigy [[John von Neumann]].  At the [[Hixon Symposium]], hosted by [[Linus Pauling]] in [[Pasadena, California]] in the late 1940s, von Neumann delivered a lecture titled "The General and Logical Theory of Automata."  He defined an "automaton" as any machine whose behavior proceeded logically from step to step by combining information from the environment and its own programming, and said that natural organisms would in the end be found to follow similar simple rules.  He also spoke about the idea of [[self-replicating machine]]s.  He postulated a machine &amp;ndash; a [[kinematic automaton]] &amp;ndash; made up of a control computer, a construction arm, and a long series of instructions, floating in a lake of parts.  By following the instructions that were part of its own body, it could create an identical machine.  He followed this idea by creating (with [[Stanislaw Ulam]]) a purely logic-based automaton, not requiring a physical body but based on the changing states of the cells in an infinite grid &amp;ndash; the first [[cellular automaton]].  It was extraordinarily complicated compared to later CAs, having hundreds of thousands of cells which could each exist in one of twenty-nine states, but von Neumann felt he needed the complexity in order for it to function not just as a self-replicating "machine", but also as a [[universal computer]] as defined by [[Alan Turing]].  This "[[Von Neumann universal constructor|universal constructor]]" read from a tape of instructions and wrote out a series of cells that could then be made active to leave a fully functional copy of the original machine and its tape. Von Neumann worked on his [[automata theory]] intensively right up to his death, and considered it his most important work.

[[Homer Jacobson]] illustrated basic self-replication in the 1950s with a model train set &amp;ndash; a seed "organism" consisting of a "head" and "tail" boxcar could use the simple rules of the system to consistently create new "organisms" identical to itself, so long as there was a random pool of new boxcars to draw from.
[[Edward F. Moore]] proposed "Artificial Living Plants", which would be floating factories which could create copies of themselves.  They could be programmed to perform some function (extracting fresh water, harvesting minerals from seawater) for an investment that would be relatively small compared to the huge returns from the exponentially growing numbers of factories.  [[Freeman Dyson]] also studied the idea, envisioning self-replicating machines sent to explore and exploit other planets and moons, and a NASA group called the Self-Replicating Systems Concept Team performed a 1980 study on the feasibility of a self-building lunar factory.

University of Cambridge professor [[John Horton Conway]] invented the most famous cellular automaton in the 1960s.  He called it the [[Conway's Game of Life|Game of Life]], and publicized it through [[Martin Gardner]]'s column in ''[[Scientific American]]'' magazine.

==1970s&amp;ndash;1980s==
Philosophy scholar [[Arthur Burks]], who had worked with von Neumann (and indeed, organized his papers after Neumann's death), headed the Logic of Computers Group at the [[University of Michigan]].  He brought the overlooked views of 19th century American thinker [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] into the modern age.  Peirce was a strong believer that all of nature's workings were based on logic (though not always deductive logic).  The Michigan group was one of the few groups still interested in alife and CAs in the early 1970s; one of its students, [[Tommaso Toffoli]] argued in his PhD thesis that the field was important because its results explain the simple rules that underlay complex effects in nature.  Toffoli later provided a key proof that CAs were [[Reversible computing|reversible]], just as the true universe is considered to be.

[[Christopher Langton]] was an unconventional researcher, with an undistinguished academic career that led him to a job programming [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] mainframes for a hospital.  He became enthralled by Conway's Game of Life, and began pursuing the idea that the computer could emulate living creatures.  After years of study (and a near-fatal hang-gliding accident), he began attempting to actualize Von Neumann's CA and the work of [[Edgar F. Codd]], who had simplified Von Neumann's original twenty-nine state monster to one with only eight states.  He succeeded in creating the first self-replicating computer organism in October 1979, using only an [[Apple II]] desktop computer.  He entered Burks' graduate program at the Logic of Computers Group in 1982, at the age of 33, and helped to found a new discipline.

Langton's official conference announcement of Artificial Life I was the earliest description of a field which had previously barely existed:&lt;ref&gt;Langton, C.G. (1989) "Artificial Life", in ''Artificial Life'', Langton (ed), (Addison-Wesley:Reading, MA) page 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Artificial life is the study of artificial systems that exhibit behavior characteristic of natural living systems.  It is the quest to explain life in any of its possible manifestations, without restriction to the particular examples that have evolved on earth.  This includes biological and chemical experiments, computer simulations, and purely theoretical endeavors.  Processes occurring on molecular, social, and evolutionary scales are subject to investigation.  The ultimate goal is to extract the logical form of living systems.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Microelectronic technology and genetic engineering will soon give us the capability to create new life forms ''in silico'' as well as ''in vitro''.  This capacity will present humanity with the most far-reaching technical, theoretical and ethical challenges it has ever confronted.  The time seems appropriate for a gathering of those involved in attempts to simulate or synthesize aspects of living systems.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Ed Fredkin]] founded the Information Mechanics Group at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], which united Toffoli, [[Norman Margolus]], [[Gerard Vichniac]], and [[Charles H. Bennett (computer scientist)|Charles Bennett]].  This group created a computer especially designed to execute cellular automata, eventually reducing it to the size of a single circuit board.  This "cellular automata machine" allowed an explosion of alife research among scientists who could not otherwise afford sophisticated computers.

In 1982, computer scientist named [[Stephen Wolfram]] turned his attention to cellular automata.  He explored and categorized the types of [[complexity]] displayed by one-dimensional CAs, and showed how they applied to natural phenomena such as the patterns of seashells and the nature of plant growth.
[[Norman Packard]], who worked with Wolfram at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]], used CAs to simulate the growth of snowflakes, following very basic rules.

Computer animator [[Craig Reynolds (computer graphics)|Craig Reynolds]] similarly used three simple rules to create recognizable [[Flocking (behavior)|flocking]] behaviour in a [[Boids|computer program]] in 1987 to animate groups of boids.  With no top-down programming at all, the boids produced lifelike solutions to evading obstacles placed in their path.  [[Computer animation]] has continued to be a key commercial driver of alife research as the creators of [[Film|movie]]s attempt to find more realistic and inexpensive ways to animate natural forms such as plant life, animal movement, hair growth, and complicated organic textures.

The Unit of Theoretical Behavioural Ecology at the [[Free University of Brussels]] applied the self-organization theories of [[Ilya Prigogine]] and the work of entomologist [[E.O. Wilson]] to research the behavior of social insects, particularly [[allelomimesis]], in which an individual's actions are dictated by those of a neighbor.  They developed partial differential equations which modeled the shapes created by termites when constructing their nest.  They then compared that to the reaction of real termites to identical changes in laboratory colonies, and refined their theories about the rules which underlay the behavior.

[[J. Doyne Farmer]] was a key figure in tying artificial life research to the emerging field of [[complex adaptive system]]s, working at the [[Center for Nonlinear Studies]] (a basic research section of [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]]), just as its star chaos theorist [[Mitchell Feigenbaum]] was leaving.  Farmer and Norman Packard chaired a conference in May 1985 called "Evolution, Games, and Learning", which was to presage many of the topics of later alife conferences.

==2000s==
On the ecological front, research regarding the evolution of animal cooperative behavior (started by [[W. D. Hamilton]] in the 1960s &lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, W. D. The genetical evolution of social behaviour. I and II. J. Theor.
Biol. 7, 1&amp;ndash;52 (1964).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Axelrod, R. &amp; Hamilton, W. D. The evolution of cooperation. Science 211,
1390&amp;ndash;1396 (1981).&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in theories of kin selection, reciprocity, multilevel selection and cultural group selection) was re-introduced via artificial life by [[Peter Turchin]] and Mikhail Burtsev in 2006. Previously, [[game theory]] has been utilized in similar investigation, however, that approach was deemed to be rather limiting in its amount of possible strategies and debatable set of payoff rules. The alife model designed here, instead, is based upon [[Conway's Game of Life]] but with much added complexity (there are over 10&lt;sup&gt;1000&lt;/sup&gt; strategies that can potentially emerge). Most significantly, the interacting agents are characterized by external phenotype markers which allows for recognition amongst in-group members. In effect, it is shown that given the capacity to perceive these markers, agents within the system are then able to evolve new group behaviors under minimalistic assumptions. On top of the already known strategies of the bourgeois-[[hawk-dove game]], here two novel modes of cooperative attack and defense arise from the simulation.

For the setup, this two-dimensional artificial world is divided into cells, each empty or containing a resource bundle. An empty cell can acquire a resource bundle with a certain probability per unit of time and lose it when an agent consumes the resource. Each agent is plainly constructed with a set of receptors, effectors (the components that govern the agents' behavior), and neural net which connect the two. In response to the environment, an agent may rest, eat, reproduce by division, move, turn and attack. All actions{{Clarify|date=July 2010}} &lt;!--is this true? (see next comment)--&gt; expend energy taken from its internal energy storage; once that is depleted, the agent dies. Consumption of resource, as well as other agents after defeating them, yields an increase &lt;!--or should this say "a net increase"?--&gt; in the energy storage. Reproduction is modeled as being asexual while the offspring receive half the parental energy. Agents are also equipped with sensory inputs that allow them to detect resources or other members within a parameter{{Clarify|date=July 2010}} in addition to its own level of vitality. As for the phenotype markers, they do not influence behavior but solely function as indicator of 'genetic' similarity. Heredity is achieved by having the relevant information be inherited by the offspring and subjected to a set rate of mutation.

The objective of the investigation is to study how the presence of phenotype markers affects the model's range of evolving cooperative strategies. In addition, as the resource available in this 2D environment is capped, the simulation also serves to determine the effect of environmental carrying capacity on their emergence.

One previously unseen strategy is termed the "raven". These agents leave cells with in-group members, thus avoiding intra-specific competition, and attack out-group members voluntarily. Another strategy, named the 'starling', involves the agent sharing cells with in-group members. Despite individuals having smaller energy storage due to resource partitioning, this strategy permits highly effective defense against large invaders via the advantage in numbers. Ecologically speaking, this resembles the [[mobbing behavior]] that characterizes many species of small birds when they collectively defend against the predator.

In conclusion, the research claims that the simulated results have important implications for the evolution of [[territoriality (ethology)|territoriality]] by showing that within the alife framework it is possible to "model not only how one strategy displaces another, but also the very process by which new strategies emerge from a large quantity of possibilities".&lt;ref&gt;Burtsev M, Turchin P. 2006. Evolution of cooperative strategies from first principles. Nature&lt;/ref&gt;

Work is also underway to create [[computational biomodeling|cellular models of artificial life]].  Initial work on building a complete biochemical model of cellular behavior is underway as part of a number of different research projects, namely [[Blue Gene]] which seeks to understand the mechanisms behind [[protein folding]].

The '''[[history]] of [[in vitro fertilisation]]''' goes back more than half a century.

==Early developments==
There was a transient biochemical pregnancy reported by Australian Foxton School researchers in 1953. [[John_Rock_(American_scientist)|John Rock]] was the first to extract an intact fertilized egg.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Gladwell |first=Malcolm |title=John Rock's Error |journal=The New Yorker |date=10 March 2000 |url=http://www.gladwell.com/2000/2000_03_10_a_rock.htm |accessdate=17 June 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511133811/http://www.gladwell.com/2000/2000_03_10_a_rock.htm |archivedate=11 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, [[Min Chueh Chang]] at the [[Worcester Foundation for Experimental Biology|Worcester Foundation]], proved fertilisation in vitro was capable of proceeding to a birth of a live rabbit.

==Early, non-viable pregnancies==
The first pregnancy achieved through ''in vitro'' human fertilisation of a human oocyte was reported in The Lancet from the [[Monash University]] team of [[Carl Wood]], John Leeton and [[Alan Trounson]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080720070634/http://www.monashivf.com/default.asp?action=article&amp;ID=21660 History Of IVF]. monashivf.com&lt;/ref&gt; in 1973, although it lasted only a few days and would today be called a biochemical pregnancy. [[Landrum Shettles]] attempted to perform an IVF in 1973, but his departmental chairman interdicted the procedure at the last moment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/biography/babies-bio-shettles/ Biography: Landrum Shettles].

''New York Times''.]&lt;/ref&gt;  There was also an ectopic pregnancy reported by [[Patrick Steptoe]] and [[Robert Geoffrey Edwards|Robert Edwards]] in 1976. 

==First baby==
In 1977, Steptoe and Edwards successfully carried out a pioneering conception which resulted in the birth of the world's first baby to be conceived by IVF, [[Louise Brown]] on 25 July 1978, in [[Oldham General Hospital]], Greater Manchester, UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

==Second baby==
In October 1978, it was reported that [[Subhash Mukhopadhyay (physician)|Subash Mukhopadyay]], a relatively unknown physician from [[Kolkata]], India was performing experiments on his own with primitive instruments and a household refrigerator and this resulted in a test tube baby, later named as "Durga" (alias Kanupriya Agarwal) who was born on 3 October 1978.&lt;ref&gt;The New Scientist, 18 October 1978, page 158&lt;/ref&gt; However, state authorities prevented him from presenting his work at scientific conferences&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1101005/jsp/frontpage/story_13020013.jsp |title=Test tube triumph &amp; tragedy – Nobel for UK scientist stirs memory of a Bengal doctor |work=The Telegraph |location=Kolkota, India |date=5 October 2010 |accessdate=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in the absence of scientific evidence, his work is not recognised by the international scientific community. These days, however, Mukhopadhyay's contribution is acknowledged in works dealing with the subject.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkEko0DybuQ&lt;/ref&gt;

==First boy and transformation from pure research to treatment==
Steptoe and Edwards were responsible for the world’s first confirmed boy conceived by IVF, Alastair MacDonald born on 14 January 1979 in Glasgow.&lt;ref&gt;The Daily Telegraph, London, 15 January 1979, page 1&lt;/ref&gt; A team led by [[Ian Johnston (doctor)|Ian Johnston]] and Alex Lopata were responsible for Australia's first baby conceived by IVF, Candice Reed, born on 23 June 1980 in Melbourne.&lt;ref&gt;The Times, London, 24 June 1980, page 7&lt;/ref&gt; It was the subsequent use of stimulated cycles with clomiphene citrate and the use of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) to control and time oocyte maturation, thus controlling the time of collection, that converted IVF from a research tool to a clinical treatment.

This was followed by a total of 14 pregnancies resulting in nine births in 1981 with the Monash University team. [[Howard W. Jones]] and [[Georgeanna Seegar Jones]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jonesinstitute.org/ |title=The Jones Institute for Reproductive Medicine website |publisher=Jonesinstitute.org |accessdate=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Eastern Virginia Medical School]] in [[Norfolk, Virginia]], further improved stimulated cycles by incorporating the use of a follicle-stimulating hormone (uHMG). This then became known as controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH). Another step forward was the use of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRHA), thus decreasing the need for monitoring by preventing premature ovulation, and more recently gonadotrophin-releasing hormone antagonists (GnRH Ant), which have a similar function. The additional use of the oral contraceptive pill has allowed the scheduling of IVF cycles, which has made the treatment far more convenient for both staff and patients.

==Subsequent refinements==
The ability to freeze and subsequently thaw and transfer embryos has significantly improved the feasibility of IVF use.&lt;ref name="pmid17177108"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Kyono K, Uto H, Nakajo Y, Kumagai S, Araki Y, Kanto S |title=Seven pregnancies and deliveries from non-mosaic Klinefelter syndrome patients using fresh and frozen testicular sperm |journal=J.

Palermo]] et al.in Brussels ([[UZ Brussel]]), 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.biomedcentral.com/1743-1050/pubmed/1351601 Pregnancies after intracytoplasmic injection of single spermatozoon into an oocyte]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. G Palermo, H Joris, P Devroey, AC Van Steirteghem - Lancet, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; This has enabled men with minimal sperm production to achieve pregnancies. ICSI is sometimes used in conjunction with sperm recovery, using a testicular fine needle or open testicular biopsy. Using this method, some men with Klinefelter's syndrome, and so would be otherwise infertile, have occasionally been able to achieve pregnancy.&lt;ref name="pmid17177108"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Okada H, Goda K, Muto S, Maruyama O, Koshida M, Horie S |title=Four pregnancies in nonmosaic Klinefelter's syndrome using cryopreserved-thawed testicular spermatozoa |journal=Fertil.

[[Robert Geoffrey Edwards|Robert Edwards]] was awarded the 2010 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] "for the development of ''in vitro'' fertilization".&lt;ref name="nobelpr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2010/press.html |title=The 2010 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine – Press Release |publisher=Nobelprize.org |date=4 October 2010 |accessdate=4 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Steptoe and [[Jean Purdy]] were not eligible for consideration as the Nobel Prize is not awarded posthumously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gosden |first1=Roger |title=Jean Marian Purdy remembered – the hidden life of an IVF pioneer |journal=Human Fertility |date=7 September 2017 |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=86–89 |doi=10.1080/14647273.2017.1351042}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carl Wood]] was dubbed "the father of IVF (''in vitro'' fertilisation)" for having pioneered the use of frozen embryos.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asap.unimelb.edu.au/bsparcs/biogs/P003036b.htm Wood, Edwin Carlyle (1929 – )].

==How many babies are born as a result of IVF==

[[File:Fountain of Eternal Life crop.jpg|thumb|250px|The ''[[Fountain of Eternal Life]]'' in [[Cleveland|Cleveland, Ohio]] is described as symbolizing "Man rising above death, reaching upward to God and toward Peace."&lt;ref name="GVCM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clevelandvetsmemorial.org/GCVM_History.html |title=GCVM History and Mission |accessdate=2009-01-14 |publisher=Greater Cleveland Veteran's Memorial, Inc. |date=2003 |author=Marshall Fredericks |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216170723/http://www.clevelandvetsmemorial.org/GCVM_History.html |archivedate=2009-02-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Immortality''' is eternal [[life]], being exempt from [[death]], unending existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Merriam-Webster|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/immortality|website=merriam-webster.com|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Immortality#Biological immortality|Some modern species]] may possess [[biological immortality]].

Certain scientists, [[futurist]]s, and philosophers have theorized about the immortality of the human body, with some suggesting that human immortality may be achievable in the first few decades of the 21st century. Other advocates believe that [[life extension]] is a more achievable goal in the short term, with immortality awaiting further research breakthroughs. The absence of aging would provide humans with biological immortality, but not invulnerability to death by disease or [[major trauma|physical trauma]]; although [[mind uploading]] could solve that if it proved possible. Whether the process of internal endoimmortality is delivered within the upcoming years depends chiefly on research (and in neuron research in the case of endoimmortality through an immortalized cell line) in the former view and perhaps is an awaited goal in the latter case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282157696|title=Artificial Neural Command Theory(American English) (US)|last=Hentrich |first=Michael|date= September 2015|accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[religion|religious]] contexts, immortality is often stated to be one of the promises of [[God]] (or other deities) to human beings who show goodness or else follow [[divine law]]. What form an unending human life would take, or whether an immaterial [[soul]] exists and possesses immortality, has been a major point of focus of [[religion]], as well as the subject of speculation, fantasy, and debate.

==Definitions==

===Scientific===
{{main|Anti-aging movement}}
[[Life extension]] technologies promise a path to complete [[rejuvenation (aging)|rejuvenation]]. [[Cryonics]] holds out the hope that the dead can be revived in the future, following sufficient medical advancements. While, as shown with creatures such as [[Hydra (genus)|hydra]] and [[Planarian|planarian worms]], it is indeed possible for a creature to be [[Biological immortality|biologically immortal]], it is not known if it is possible for humans.

[[Mind uploading]] is the transference of brain states from a human brain to an alternative medium providing similar functionality. Assuming the process to be possible and repeatable, this would provide immortality to the computation of the original brain, as predicted by [[futurist]]s such as [[Ray Kurzweil]].&lt;ref name="Kurzweil 2005"&gt;{{cite book |author=Kurzweil, Raymond |authorlink=Raymond Kurzweil |title=The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology |publisher=Viking Adult |date=2005 |isbn=978-0-670-03384-3|title-link=The Singularity Is Near }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious===
{{See also|Soul}}
The belief in an ''[[afterlife]]'' is a fundamental tenet of most religions, including [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]], [[Sikhism]], [[Christianity]], [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], and the [[Bahá'í Faith]]; however, the concept of an immortal [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] is not. The "soul" itself has different meanings and is not used in the same way in different religions and different denominations of a religion. For example, various branches of Christianity have disagreeing views on the soul's immortality and its relation to the body.

==Physical immortality==
Physical immortality is a state of life that allows a person to avoid death and maintain conscious thought. It can mean the unending existence of a person from a physical source other than organic life, such as a computer. Active pursuit of physical immortality can either be based on scientific trends, such as [[cryonics]], [[digital immortality]], breakthroughs in [[rejuvenation (aging)|rejuvenation]] or predictions of an impending [[technological singularity]], or because of a spiritual belief, such as those held by [[Rastafari movement|Rastafarians]] or [[Rebirthing-Breathwork|Rebirthers]].

===Causes of death===
{{Main|Death}}

There are three main causes of death: [[aging]], [[disease]] and [[physical trauma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hayflick|first=L|title=Biological Aging is No Longer an Unsolved Problem|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|volume=1100|issue=1|pages=1–13|date=2007|url=http://0-content.ebscohost.com.helin.uri.edu/pdf19_22/pdf/2007/YQR/11Apr07/24963097.pdf?T=P&amp;P=AN&amp;K=24963097&amp;S=R&amp;D=a9h&amp;EbscoContent=dGJyMNLr40SeprE4v%2BbwOLCmr0qepq5Srqi4TLSWxWXS&amp;ContentCustomer=dGJyMPGvrki0ra9JuePfgeyx44Dt6fIA|doi=10.1196/annals.1395.001|pmid=17460161|bibcode=2007NYASA1100....1H}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such issues can be resolved with the solutions provided in research to any end providing such alternate theories at present that require unification.

====Aging====
[[Aubrey de Grey]], a leading researcher in the field,&lt;ref name="Garreau"/&gt; defines [[aging]] as "a collection of cumulative changes to the [[molecular]] and [[cell (biology)|cellular]] structure of an adult [[organism]], which result in essential [[metabolic]] processes, but which also, once they progress far enough, increasingly disrupt metabolism, resulting in [[pathology]] and death." The current causes of aging in humans are cell loss (without replacement), [[DNA damage theory of aging|DNA damage]], [[oncology|oncogenic]] [[cell nucleus|nuclear]] [[mutation]]s and [[epimutation]]s, cell [[senescence]], [[mitochondria]]l mutations, [[lysosomal]] aggregates, extracellular aggregates, random extracellular cross-linking, [[immune system]] decline, and [[endocrine]] changes. Eliminating aging would require finding a solution to each of these causes, a program de Grey calls [[Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence|engineered negligible senescence]]. There is also a huge body of knowledge indicating that change is characterized by the loss of molecular fidelity.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein C, Bernstein H. (1991) ''Aging, Sex, and DNA Repair''. Academic Press, San Diego. {{ISBN|0120928604}}  {{ISBN|978-0120928606}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Disease====
Disease is theoretically surmountable via [[technology]]. In short, it is an abnormal condition affecting the body of an organism, something the body shouldn't typically have to deal with its natural make up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Classification of diseases functioning and disability|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/icd.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human understanding of [[genetics]] is leading to cures and treatments for a myriad of previously incurable diseases. The mechanisms by which other diseases do damage are becoming better understood. Sophisticated methods of detecting diseases early are being developed. [[Preventative medicine]] is becoming better understood. Neurodegenerative diseases like [[Parkinson's disease|Parkinson's]] and [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer's]] may soon be curable with the use of [[stem cells]]. Breakthroughs in [[cell biology]] and [[telomere]] research are leading to treatments for [[cancer]]. [[Vaccine]]s are being researched for [[AIDS]] and [[tuberculosis]]. Genes associated with [[type 1 diabetes]] and certain types of cancer have been discovered, allowing for new therapies to be developed. Artificial devices attached directly to the [[nervous system]] may restore sight to the blind. Drugs are being developed to treat a myriad of other diseases and ailments.

====Trauma====
[[Physical trauma]] would remain as a threat to perpetual physical life, as an otherwise immortal person would still be subject to unforeseen accidents or catastrophes. The speed and quality of [[paramedic]] [[disaster relief operation|response]] remains a determining factor in surviving severe trauma.&lt;ref name=walker&gt;{{cite book |last=Walker |first=Peter |title=International Search and Rescue Teams, A League Discussion Paper |date=1991 |publisher=[[IFRC|League of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies]] |location=[[Geneva]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A body that could automatically repair itself from severe trauma, such as speculated uses for [[nanotechnology]], would mitigate this factor.
Being the seat of [[consciousness]], the [[brain]] cannot be risked to trauma if a continuous physical life is to be maintained. This aversion to trauma risk to the brain would naturally result in significant behavioral changes that would render physical immortality undesirable for some people.

====Environmental change ====
Organisms otherwise unaffected by these causes of death would still face the problem of obtaining sustenance (whether from currently available agricultural processes or from hypothetical future technological processes) in the face of changing availability of suitable resources as environmental conditions change. After avoiding aging, disease, and trauma, you could still starve to death.

If there is no limitation on the degree of gradual mitigation of risk then it is possible that the [[cumulative probability]] of death over an infinite horizon is less than [[certainty]], even when the risk of fatal trauma [[Survival analysis#Hazard function and cumulative hazard function|in any finite period]] is greater than zero. Mathematically, this is an aspect of achieving "[[Indefinite lifespan#Actuarial escape velocity|actuarial escape velocity]]"

===Biological immortality===
[[File:Telomere caps.gif|thumb|right|Human [[chromosome]]s (grey) capped by telomeres (white)]]
{{Main|Biological immortality}}

Biological immortality is an absence of aging. Specifically it's the absence of a sustained increase in [[rate of mortality]] as a function of chronological age. A cell or organism that does not experience aging, or ceases to age at some point, is biologically immortal.

[[Biologist]]s have chosen the word "immortal" to designate cells that are not limited by the [[Hayflick limit]], where cells no longer divide because of [[DNA repair|DNA damage]] or shortened [[telomere]]s. The first and still most widely used immortal cell line is [[HeLa]], developed from cells taken from the malignant cervical tumor of [[Henrietta Lacks]] without her consent in 1951. Prior to the 1961 work of [[Leonard Hayflick]], there was the erroneous belief fostered by [[Alexis Carrel]] that all normal [[Somatic (biology)|somatic]] cells are immortal. By preventing cells from reaching senescence one can achieve biological immortality; telomeres, a "cap" at the end of DNA, are thought to be the cause of cell aging. Every time a cell divides the telomere becomes a bit shorter; when it is finally worn down, the cell is unable to split and dies. [[Telomerase]] is an enzyme which rebuilds the telomeres in stem cells and cancer cells, allowing them to replicate an infinite number of times.&lt;ref name="LinKahWai"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lin Kah Wai |authorlink=Lin Kah Wai |title=Telomeres, Telomerase, and Tumorigenesis -- A Review |journal=MedGenMed |date=18 April 2004 |volume=6 |issue=3 |page=19 |pmid=15520642 |pmc=1435592}}&lt;/ref&gt; No definitive work has yet demonstrated that telomerase can be used in human somatic cells to prevent healthy tissues from aging. On the other hand, scientists hope to be able to grow organs with the help of stem cells, allowing organ transplants without the risk of rejection, another step in extending human life expectancy. These technologies are the subject of ongoing research, and are not yet realized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/26/science/chimera-stemcells-organs.html|title=New Prospects for Growing Human Replacement Organs in Animals|website=nytimes.com|access-date=March 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Biologically immortal species====
{{see also|List of longest-living organisms}}

Life defined as biologically immortal is still susceptible to causes of death besides aging, including disease and trauma, as defined above. Notable immortal species include:
* ''[[Bacteria]]'' – Bacteria reproduce through [[Fission (biology)|binary fission]]. A parent bacterium splits itself into two identical daughter cells which eventually then split themselves in half. This process repeats, thus making the bacterium essentially immortal. A 2005 [[PLoS Biology]] paper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/08/01/54/PDF/stewart_Plos.pdf|title= Aging and Death in an Organism That Reproduces by Morphologically Symmetric Division}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that after each division the daughter cells can be identified as the older and the younger, and the older is slightly smaller, weaker, and more likely to die than the younger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newscientist.com/channel/health/mg18524855.800-bacteria-death-reduces-human-hopes-of-immortality.html |title=Bacteria Death Reduces Human Hopes of Immortality |date=February 5, 2005 |website=New Scientist magazine, issue 2485, page 19 |accessdate=2007-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''[[Bristlecone pine]]s'' are speculated to be potentially immortal;{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} the oldest known living specimen is over 5,000 years old.

====Evolution of aging====
{{Main|Evolution of aging}}&lt;!--that's how they spell aging in England ... and in that article--&gt;
As the existence of biologically immortal species demonstrates, there is no [[second law of thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] necessity for senescence: a defining feature of life is that it takes in [[Gibbs free energy|free energy]] from the environment and unloads its [[entropy]] as waste. Living systems can even build themselves up from seed, and routinely repair themselves. Aging is therefore presumed to be a byproduct of [[evolution]], but why mortality should be selected for remains a subject of research and debate. Programmed cell death and the telomere "end replication problem" are found even in the earliest and simplest of organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, W.R. 1999. ''A Means to an End: The biological basis of aging and death.'' New York: Oxford University Press. {{cite web |url=http://wrclarkbooks.com/means_to_an_end.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-05-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511212036/http://www.wrclarkbooks.com/means_to_an_end.html |archivedate=2008-05-11 |df= }} About telomeres and programmed cell death.&lt;/ref&gt; This may be a tradeoff between selecting for cancer and selecting for aging.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, Ch. 69, Cancer cell biology and angiogenesis, Robert G. Fenton and Dan L. Longo, p. 454.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern theories on the evolution of aging include the following:
* Mutation accumulation is a theory formulated by [[Peter Medawar]] in 1952 to explain how evolution would select for aging. Essentially, aging is never selected against, as organisms have offspring before the mortal mutations surface in an individual.
* [[Pleiotropy|Antagonistic pleiotropy]] is a theory proposed as an alternative by [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]], a critic of Medawar, in 1957. In antagonistic pleiotropy, genes carry effects that are both beneficial and detrimental. In essence this refers to genes that offer benefits early in life, but exact a cost later on, i.e. decline and death.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, G.C. 1957. Pleiotropy, natural selection and the evolution of senescence. ''Evolution'', '''11''':398-411. {{cite web|url=http://www.telomere.org/Downloads/Williams_searchable.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060713071204/http://www.telomere.org/Downloads/Williams_searchable.pdf |archivedate=2006-07-13 |df= }} Paper in which Williams describes his theory of antagonistic pleiotropy.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The disposable soma theory was proposed in 1977 by [[Thomas Kirkwood]], which states that an individual body must allocate energy for metabolism, reproduction, and maintenance, and must compromise when there is food scarcity. Compromise in allocating energy to the repair function is what causes the body gradually to deteriorate with age, according to Kirkwood.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkwood, T.B.L. 1977. Evolution of aging. ''Nature'', '''270''': 301-304. [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v270/n5635/abs/270301a0.html] Origin of the disposable soma theory.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prospects for human biological immortality===

====Life-extending substances====
There are some known naturally occurring and artificially produced chemicals that may increase the lifetime or life-expectancy of a person or organism, such as [[resveratrol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.phytochemicals.info/abstracts/resveratrol-life-span.php |title=Resveratrol may increase life span |publisher=Phytochemicals.info |accessdate=2010-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=:: compound resveratrol may turn off a protein that guards cancer cells from cancer-fighting therapies |url=http://www.wordpress.rudramani.com/2009/07/13/compound-resveratrol-may-turn-off-a-protein-that-guards-cancer-cells-from-cancer-fighting-therapies/ |publisher=Wordpress.rudramani.com |date=2009-07-13 |accessdate=2010-11-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140803231526/http://www.wordpress.rudramani.com/2009/07/13/compound-resveratrol-may-turn-off-a-protein-that-guards-cancer-cells-from-cancer-fighting-therapies/ |archivedate=2014-08-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[scientist]]s believe that boosting the amount or proportion of [[telomerase]] in the body, a naturally forming enzyme that helps maintain the protective caps at the ends of [[chromosome]]s, could prevent cells from dying and so may ultimately lead to extended, healthier lifespans. A team of researchers at the Spanish National Cancer Centre ([[Madrid]]) tested the hypothesis on mice. It was found that those mice which were [[genetic engineering|genetically engineered]] to produce 10 times the normal levels of telomerase lived 50% longer than normal mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/3489881/Scientists-take-a-step-closer-to-an-elixir-of-youth.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |title=Scientists take a step closer to an elixir of youth |first=Richard |last=Alleyne |date=November 20, 2008 |accessdate=May 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In normal circumstances, without the presence of telomerase, if a cell divides repeatedly, at some point all the progeny will reach their [[Hayflick limit]]. With the presence of telomerase, each dividing cell can replace the lost bit of [[DNA]], and any single cell can then divide unbounded. While this unbounded growth property has excited many researchers, caution is warranted in exploiting this property, as exactly this same unbounded growth is a crucial step in enabling cancerous growth. If an organism can replicate its body cells faster, then it would theoretically stop aging.

[[Embryonic stem cells]] express telomerase, which allows them to divide repeatedly and form the individual. In adults, telomerase is highly expressed in cells that need to divide regularly (e.g., in the immune system), whereas most [[Somatic (biology)|somatic]] cells express it only at very low levels in a cell-cycle dependent manner.

====Technological immortality, biological machines, and  "swallowing the doctor"====
{{Main|Transhumanism}}

Technological immortality is the prospect for much longer life spans made possible by scientific advances in a variety of fields: nanotechnology, emergency room procedures, genetics, [[biological engineering]], [[regenerative medicine]], [[microbiology]], and others. Contemporary life spans in the advanced industrial societies are already markedly longer than those of the past because of better nutrition, availability of health care, standard of living and bio-medical scientific advances. Technological immortality predicts further progress for the same reasons over the near term. An important aspect of current scientific thinking about immortality is that some combination of [[human cloning]], cryonics or nanotechnology will play an essential role in extreme life extension. [[Robert Freitas]], a nanorobotics theorist, suggests tiny medical [[nanorobot]]s could be created to go through human bloodstreams, find dangerous things like cancer cells and bacteria, and destroy them.&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Freitas Jr., ''Microbivores: Artificial Mechanical Phagocytes using Digest and Discharge Protocol'', self-published, 2001 [http://www.rfreitas.com/Nano/Microbivores.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Freitas anticipates that gene-therapies and nanotechnology will eventually make the human body effectively self-sustainable and capable of living indefinitely in empty space, short of severe brain trauma. This supports the theory that we will be able to continually create biological or synthetic replacement parts to replace damaged or dying ones. Future advances in [[nanomedicine]] could give rise to [[life extension#Nanotechnology|life extension]] through the repair of many processes thought to be responsible for aging. [[K. Eric Drexler]], one of the founders of [[nanotechnology]], postulated cell repair devices, including ones operating within cells and utilizing as yet hypothetical [[molecular machine#Biological|biological machines]], in his 1986 book [[Engines of Creation]]. [[Raymond Kurzweil]], a [[futurist]] and [[transhumanist]], stated in his book ''[[The Singularity Is Near]]'' that he believes that advanced medical [[nanorobotics]] could completely remedy the effects of aging by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Ray |last=Kurzweil |authorlink=Raymond Kurzweil |year=2005 |title=The Singularity Is Near |publisher=[[Viking Press]] |location=[[New York City]] |isbn=978-0-670-03384-3 |oclc=57201348|title-link=The Singularity Is Near }}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Richard Feynman]], it was his former graduate student and collaborator [[Albert Hibbs]] who originally suggested to him (circa 1959) the idea of a ''medical'' use for Feynman's theoretical micromachines (see [[biological machine]]). Hibbs suggested that certain repair machines might one day be reduced in size to the point that it would, in theory, be possible to (as Feynman put it) "[[Molecular machine#Biological|swallow the doctor]]". The idea was incorporated into Feynman's 1959 essay ''[[There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====Cryonics====
{{Main|Cryonics}}

[[Cryonics]], the practice of preserving organisms (either intact specimens or only their brains) for possible future revival by storing them at cryogenic temperatures where metabolism and decay are almost completely stopped, can be used to 'pause' for those who believe that life extension technologies will not develop sufficiently within their lifetime. Ideally, cryonics would allow clinically dead people to be brought back in the future after cures to the patients' diseases have been discovered and [[rejuvenation (aging)|aging is reversible]]. Modern cryonics procedures use a process called [[Cryopreservation#Vitrification|vitrification]] which creates a glass-like state rather than [[freezing]] as the body is brought to low temperatures. This process reduces the risk of ice crystals damaging the cell-structure, which would be especially detrimental to cell structures in the brain, as their minute adjustment evokes the individual's mind.

====Mind-to-computer uploading====
{{Main|Mind uploading}}

One idea that has been advanced involves [[Mind uploading|uploading]] an individual's habits and memories via [[direct mind-computer interface]]. The individual's memory may be loaded to a computer or to a new organic body. [[Extropian]] [[futures studies|futurists]] like Moravec and [[Ray Kurzweil|Kurzweil]] have proposed that, thanks to [[exponential growth|exponentially growing]] computing power, it will someday be possible to [[mind uploading|upload human consciousness]] onto a computer system, and exist indefinitely in a virtual environment. This could be accomplished via advanced cybernetics, where computer hardware would initially be installed in the brain to help sort memory or accelerate thought processes. Components would be added gradually until the person's entire brain functions were handled by artificial devices, avoiding sharp transitions that would lead to issues of [[identity (social science)|identity]], thus running the risk of the person to be declared dead and thus not be a legitimate owner of his or her property. After this point, the human body could be treated as an optional accessory and the program implementing the person could be transferred to any sufficiently powerful computer. Another possible mechanism for mind upload is to perform a detailed scan of an individual's original, organic brain and simulate the entire structure in a computer. What level of detail such scans and simulations would need to achieve to emulate awareness, and whether the scanning process would destroy the brain, is still to be determined.&lt;ref name=Roadmap&gt;{{Cite book |last=Anders |first=Sandberg |last2=Nick |first2=Boström |title=Whole Brain Emulation: A Roadmap |quote=''The basic idea is to take a particular brain, scan its structure in detail, and construct a software model of it that is so faithful to the original that, when run on appropriate hardware, it will behave in essentially the same way as the original brain.'' |url=http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/Reports/2008-3.pdf |accessdate=5 April 2009 |series=Technical Report #2008‐3 |date=2008 |publisher=Future of Humanity Institute, Oxford University}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is suggested that achieving immortality through this mechanism would require specific consideration to be given to the role of [[consciousness]] in the functions of the [[mind]]. An uploaded mind would only be a copy of the original mind, and not the conscious mind of the living entity associated in such a transfer. Without a simultaneous upload of consciousness, the original living entity remains mortal, thus not achieving true immortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/iva-to/on-achieving-immortality-3ed1d567f7a2|title=On Achieving Immortality|last=Ruparel|first=Bhavik|date=2018-07-30|website=Iva.to|access-date=2018-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research on [[neural correlates of consciousness]] is yet inconclusive on this issue. Whatever the route to mind upload, persons in this state could then be considered essentially immortal, short of loss or traumatic destruction of the machines that maintained them.{{Clarify|date=October 2015}}

====Cybernetics====
{{Main|Cyborg}}

Transforming a human into a [[cyborg]] can include [[brain implants]] or extracting a human processing unit and placing it in a robotic life-support system. Even replacing biological organs with robotic ones could increase life span (e.g. pace makers) and depending on the definition, many technological upgrades to the body, like genetic modifications or the addition of nanobots would qualify an individual as a cyborg. Some people believe that such modifications would make one impervious to aging and disease and theoretically immortal unless killed or destroyed.

====Digital immortality====
{{Main|Digital immortality}}

==Religious views==
{{Main|Afterlife|Soul}}
As late as 1952, the editorial staff of the ''[[A Syntopicon: An Index to The Great Ideas|Syntopicon]]'' found in their compilation of the [[Great Books of the Western World]], that "The philosophical issue concerning immortality cannot be separated from issues concerning the existence and nature of man's soul."&lt;ref name="Syntopicon I 788"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Great Ideas: A Syntopicon of Great Books of the Western World |author=Adler, Mortimer J., ed. |authorlink=Mortimer Adler |display-authors=etal |date=1952 |page=788 |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |location=Chicago|title-link=Syntopicon }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the vast majority of speculation regarding immortality before the 21st century was regarding the nature of the [[afterlife]].

===Ancient Greek religion===
Immortality in [[ancient Greek religion]] originally always included an eternal union of body and soul as can be seen in [[Homer]], [[Hesiod]], and various other ancient texts. The soul was considered to have an eternal existence in Hades, but without the body the soul was considered dead. Although almost everybody had nothing to look forward to but an eternal existence as a disembodied dead soul, a number of men and women were considered to have gained physical immortality and been brought to live forever in either [[Elysium]], the [[Islands of the Blessed]], heaven, the ocean or literally right under the ground. Among these were [[Amphiaraus]], [[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]], [[Ino (Greek mythology)|Ino]], [[Iphigenia]], [[Menelaus]], [[Peleus]], and a great part of those who fought in the Trojan and Theban wars. Some were considered to have died and been resurrected before they achieved physical immortality. [[Asclepius]] was killed by Zeus only to be resurrected and transformed into a major deity. In some versions of the Trojan War myth, [[Achilles]], after being killed, was snatched from his funeral pyre by his divine mother Thetis, resurrected, and brought to an immortal existence in either [[Leuce (mythology)|Leuce]], the Elysian plains, or the Islands of the Blessed. [[Memnon (mythology)|Memnon]], who was killed by Achilles, seems to have received a similar fate. [[Alcmene]], [[Castor and Pollux|Castor]], [[Heracles]], and [[Melicertes]] were also among the figures sometimes considered to have been resurrected to physical immortality. According to [[Histories (Herodotus)|Herodotus' Histories]], the 7th century BC sage [[Aristeas of Proconnesus]] was first found dead, after which his body disappeared from a locked room. Later he was found not only to have been resurrected but to have gained immortality.

The philosophical idea of an [[immortal soul]] was a belief first appearing with either [[Pherecydes of Syros|Pherecydes]] or the [[Orphics]], and most importantly advocated by [[Plato]] and his followers. This, however, never became the general norm in Hellenistic thought. As may be witnessed even into the Christian era, not least by the complaints of various philosophers over popular beliefs, many or perhaps most traditional Greeks maintained the conviction that certain individuals were resurrected from the dead and made physically immortal and that others could only look forward to an existence as disembodied and dead, though everlasting, souls. The parallel between these traditional beliefs and the later resurrection of [[Jesus]] was not lost on the early Christians, as [[Justin Martyr]] argued: "when we say&amp;nbsp;... Jesus Christ, our teacher, was crucified and died, and rose again, and ascended into heaven, we propose nothing different from what you believe regarding those whom you consider sons of Zeus." (''1 Apol.'' 21).

===Buddhism===
The goal of [[Hinayana]] is [[Arhatship]] and [[Nirvana]].  By contrast, the goal of [[Mahayana]] is [[Buddhahood]].

According to one [[Tibetan Buddhist]] teaching, [[Dzogchen]], individuals can transform the physical body into an immortal body of light called the [[rainbow body]].

===Christianity===
{{main|Eternal life (Christianity)|Christian conditionalism|Christian mortalism}}
[[File:Holbein Danse Macabre 3.jpg|thumb|Adam and Eve condemned to mortality. [[Hans Holbein the Younger]], ''Danse Macabre'', 16th century]]

[[Christianity|Christian theology]] holds that [[Adam and Eve]] lost physical immortality for themselves and all their descendants in the [[Fall of man]], although this initial "imperishability of the bodily frame of man" was "a preternatural condition".&lt;ref name="Syntopicon I 784"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Great Ideas: A Syntopicon of Great Books of the Western World |author=Adler, Mortimer J., ed. |authorlink=Mortimer Adler |display-authors=etal |date=1952 |page=784 |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |location=Chicago|title-link=Syntopicon }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Christians who profess the [[Nicene Creed]] believe that every dead person (whether they believed in Christ or not) will be [[Resurrection of the Dead|resurrected from the dead]] at the [[Second Coming]], and this belief is known as [[Universal resurrection]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

[[N.T. Wright]], a theologian and former [[Bishop of Durham]], has said many people forget the physical aspect of what Jesus promised. He told [[Time (magazine)|Time]]: "Jesus' resurrection marks the beginning of a restoration that he will complete upon [[Second Coming of Christ|his return]]. Part of this will be the [[Universal resurrection|resurrection of all the dead]], who will 'awake', be embodied and participate in the renewal. Wright says [[John Polkinghorne]], a physicist and a priest, has put it this way: 'God will download our software onto his hardware until the time he gives us new hardware to run the software again for ourselves.' That gets to two things nicely: that the period after death (the [[Intermediate state]]) is a period when we are in God's presence but not active in our own bodies, and also that the more important transformation will be when we are again embodied and administering [[World to Come|Christ's kingdom]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1710844,00.html |work=Time |title=Christians Wrong About Heaven, Says Bishop&amp;#13; |date=February 7, 2008 |accessdate=May 5, 2010 |first=David |last=Van Biema}}&lt;/ref&gt; This kingdom will consist of [[World to Come|Heaven and Earth "joined together in a new creation"]], he said.

===Hinduism===
{{See also|Chiranjivi|Naraka (Hinduism)}}
[[File:Reincarnation AS.jpg|thumb|Representation of a soul undergoing ''punarjanma''. Illustration from ''Hinduism Today'', 2004]]

[[Hinduism|Hindus]] believe in an immortal soul which is [[Reincarnation|reincarnated]] after death. According to Hinduism, people repeat a process of life, death, and rebirth in a cycle called ''[[samsara]]''. If they live their life well, their ''[[karma]]'' improves and their station in the next life will be higher, and conversely lower if they live their life poorly. After many life times of perfecting its karma, the soul is freed from the cycle and lives in perpetual bliss.  There is no place of eternal torment in Hinduism, although if a soul consistently lives very evil lives, it could work its way down to the very bottom of the cycle.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

There are explicit renderings in the [[Upanishad]]s alluding to a physically immortal state brought about by purification, and sublimation of the 5 elements that make up the body. For example, in the [[Shvetashvatara Upanishad]] (Chapter 2, Verse 12), it is stated "When earth, water fire, air and akasa arise, that is to say, when the five attributes of the elements, mentioned in the books on yoga, become manifest then the yogi's body becomes purified by the fire of yoga and he is free from illness, old age and death."

Another view of immortality is traced to the Vedic tradition by the interpretation of [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
That man indeed whom these (contacts)&lt;br&gt;do not disturb, who is even-minded in&lt;br&gt;pleasure and pain, steadfast, he is fit&lt;br&gt;for immortality, O best of men.&lt;ref name="Maharishi-Mahesh-Yogi"&gt;Maharishi Mahesh Yogi on the Bhagavad-Gita, a New Translation and Commentary, Chapter 1-6. Penguin Books, 1969, pp 94-95 (v 15)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the verse means, "Once a man has become established in the understanding of the permanent reality of life, his mind rises above the influence of pleasure and pain. Such an unshakable man passes beyond the influence of death and in the permanent phase of life: he attains eternal life&amp;nbsp;... A man established in the understanding of the unlimited abundance of absolute existence is naturally free from existence of the relative order. This is what gives him the status of immortal life."&lt;ref name="Maharishi-Mahesh-Yogi"/&gt;

An Indian Tamil saint known as [[Vallalar]] claimed to have achieved immortality before disappearing forever from a locked room in 1874.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vallalar.org |title=vallalar.org |publisher=vallalar.org |date=2010-07-07 |accessdate=2010-11-04}}{{Unreliable source?|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=In the Fabled East: A Novel|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Y1RgQC-hw1MC&amp;pg=PA174&amp;dq=Vallalar+immortality+1874#v=onepage&amp;q=Vallalar%20immortality%201874&amp;f=false|author=Adam Schroeder|publisher=[[Douglas &amp; McIntyre|D &amp; M Publishers]]|page=174|isbn=9781553656159|date=2010-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sikhism ===
Sikhism was found in the 15th century and over a millennium after Hinduism and Buddhism. Therefore, sikhs have a similar belief of immortality of reincarnation like the hindus, however they belief there is a way that we could get out of the cycle of rebirth and death, by doing the good deeds that all the ten gurus have left behind for them to do. This is like being immortal itself because once, a sikh dies he or she would live forever by being the gurus angel that may come to  earth as they please to help the world a better place. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/10/sikhs-soul-lives-on-body-dies_n_1763220.html|title=For Sikhs, The Soul Lives On Long After The Body Dies|last=Burke|first=Daniel|date=2012-10-08|work=The Huffington Post|access-date=2018-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaism===
{{primary sources|date=June 2015}}
The traditional concept of an immaterial and [[Immortality of the soul|immortal soul]] distinct from the body was not found in [[Judaism]] before the [[Babylonian Exile]], but developed as a result of interaction with [[Persian philosophy|Persian]] and [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenistic philosophies]]. Accordingly, the Hebrew word ''[[nephesh]]'', although translated as "soul" in some older English Bibles, actually has a meaning closer to "living being".{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} ''Nephesh'' was rendered in the [[Septuagint]] as ''{{lang|grc|ψυχή}}'' (''psūchê''), the Greek word for soul.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

The only Hebrew word traditionally translated "soul" (''nephesh'') in English language Bibles refers to a living, breathing conscious body, rather than to an immortal soul.&lt;ref&gt;"Even as we are conscious of the broad and very common biblical usage of the term "soul," we must be clear that scripture does not present even a rudimentarily developed theology of the soul. The creation narrative is clear that all life originates with God. Yet the Hebrew scripture offers no specific understanding of the origin of individual souls, of when and how they become attached to specific bodies, or of their potential existence, apart from the body, after death. The reason for this is that, as we noted at the beginning, the Hebrew Bible does not present a theory of the soul developed much beyond the simple concept of a force associated with respiration, hence, a life-force.", Avery-Peck, "Soul", in Neusner, et al. (eds.), "The Encyclopedia of Judaism", p. 1343 (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; In the New Testament, the Greek word traditionally translated "soul" ({{lang|grc|ψυχή}}) has substantially the same meaning as the Hebrew, without reference to an immortal soul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|quote=In the nt, ‘soul’ retains its basic Hebrew field of meaning. Soul refers to one’s life: Herod sought Jesus’ soul (Matt. 2:20); one might save a soul or take it (Mark 3:4). Death occurs when God ‘requires your soul’ (Luke 12:20).}}&lt;/ref&gt; ‘Soul’ may refer to the whole person, the self: ‘three thousand souls’ were converted in Acts 2:41 (see Acts 3:23).

The [[Hebrew Bible]] speaks about ''[[Sheol]]'' (שאול), originally a synonym of the grave-the repository of the dead or the cessation of existence until the [[Resurrection of the dead#Rabbinic and Samaritan Judaism|resurrection of the dead]]. This doctrine of resurrection is mentioned explicitly only in {{bibleverse||Daniel|12:1–4|ESV}} although it may be implied in several other texts. New theories arose concerning Sheol during the [[intertestamental period]].

The views about immortality in Judaism is perhaps best exemplified by the various references to this in [[Second Temple Period]]. The concept of resurrection of the physical body is found in [[2 Maccabees]], according to which it will happen through recreation of the flesh.&lt;ref&gt;2 Maccabees 7.11, 7.28.&lt;/ref&gt; Resurrection of the dead also appears in detail in the extra-canonical books of [[Book of Enoch|Enoch]],&lt;ref&gt;1 Enoch 61.5, 61.2.&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Syriac Apocalypse of Baruch|Apocalypse of Baruch]].&lt;ref&gt;2 Baruch 50.2, 51.5&lt;/ref&gt; According to the British scholar in ancient Judaism [[Philip R. Davies]], there is “little or no clear reference … either to immortality or to resurrection from the dead” in the [[Dead Sea scrolls]] texts.&lt;ref&gt;Philip R. Davies. “Death, Resurrection and Life After Death in the Qumran Scrolls” in Alan J. Avery-Peck &amp; Jacob Neusner (eds.) ''Judaism in Late Antiquity: Part Four: Death, Life-After-Death, Resurrection, and the World-To-Come in the Judaisms of Antiquity.'' Leiden 2000:209.&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[Josephus]] and the New Testament record that the [[Sadducees]] did not believe in an [[afterlife]],&lt;ref&gt;Josephus Antiquities 18.16; Matthew 22.23; Mark 12.18; Luke 20.27; Acta 23.8.&lt;/ref&gt; but the sources vary on the beliefs of the [[Pharisees]]. The New Testament claims that the Pharisees believed in the resurrection, but does not specify whether this included the flesh or not.&lt;ref&gt;Acta 23.8.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Josephus]], who himself was a Pharisee, the Pharisees held that only the soul was immortal and the souls of good people will be [[reincarnation|reincarnated]] and “pass into other bodies,” while “the souls of the wicked will suffer eternal punishment.” &lt;ref&gt;Josephus ''Jewish War'' 2.8.14; cf. ''Antiquities'' 8.14-15.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Book of Jubilees|Jubilees]] seems to refer to the resurrection of the soul only, or to a more general idea of an immortal soul.&lt;ref&gt;Jubilees 23.31&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rabbinic Judaism]] claims that the righteous dead will be resurrected in the [[Messianic Age]] with the coming of the [[messiah in Judaism|messiah]]. They will then be granted immortality in a perfect world. The wicked dead, on the other hand, will not be resurrected at all. This is not the only Jewish belief about the afterlife. The [[Tanakh]] is not specific about the afterlife, so there are wide differences in views and explanations among believers.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

===Taoism===
{{See also|Chinese alchemy|Taoism and death|Xian (Taoism)}}

It is repeatedly stated in [[Lüshi Chunqiu]] that death is unavoidable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Creel|first=Herrlee G.|title=What is Taoism? : and other studies in Chinese cultural history|date=1982|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0226120478|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henri Maspero]] noted that many scholarly works frame Taoism as a school of thought focused on the quest for immortality.&lt;ref&gt;Maspero, Henri. Translated by Frank A. Kierman, Jr. Taoism and Chinese Religion (University of Massachusetts Press, 1981), p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; Isabelle Robinet asserts that Taoism is better understood as a ''way of life'' than as a religion, and that its adherents do not approach or view Taoism the way non-Taoist historians have done.&lt;ref&gt;Robinet, Isabelle. Taoism: Growth of a Religion (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1997 [original French 1992]), p. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Tractate of Actions and their Retributions, a traditional teaching, spiritual immortality can be rewarded to people who do a certain amount of good deeds and live a simple, pure life. A list of good deeds and sins are tallied to determine whether or not a mortal is worthy. Spiritual immortality in this definition allows the soul to leave the earthly realms of afterlife and go to pure realms in the Taoist cosmology.&lt;ref&gt;Translated by Legge, James. The Texts of Taoism. 1962, Dover Press. NY.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zoroastrianism===
[[Zoroastrian]]s believe that on the fourth day after death, the human soul leaves the body and the body remains as an empty shell. Souls would go to either heaven or hell; these concepts of the afterlife in Zoroastrianism may have influenced Abrahamic religions. The Persian word for "immortal" is associated with the month "Amurdad", meaning "deathless" in Persian, in the [[Iranian calendar]] (near the end of July). The month of Amurdad or [[Ameretat]] is celebrated in Persian culture as ancient Persians believed the "Angel of Immortality" won over the "Angel of Death" in this month.&lt;ref&gt;Hoshang, Dr. Bhadha. http://tenets.zoroastrianism.com/topi33.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170727145155/http://tenets.zoroastrianism.com/topi33.html |date=2017-07-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical arguments for the immortality of the soul==

===Alcmaeon of Croton===
[[Alcmaeon of Croton]] argued that the soul is continuously and ceaselessly in motion. The exact form of his argument is unclear, but it appears to have influenced Plato, Aristotle, and other later writers.&lt;ref name="alcmaeon"&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/alcmaeon/#immort&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plato===
[[Plato]]'s ''[[Phaedo]]'' advances four arguments for the soul's immortality:&lt;ref&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plato/&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[Phaedo#The Cyclical Argument|Cyclical Argument]], or Opposites Argument explains that [[Theory of forms|Forms]] are eternal and unchanging, and as the soul always brings life, then it must not die, and is necessarily "imperishable". As the body is mortal and is subject to physical death, the soul must be its indestructible opposite. Plato then suggests the analogy of fire and cold. If the form of cold is imperishable, and fire, its opposite, was within close proximity, it would have to withdraw intact as does the soul during death. This could be likened to the idea of the opposite charges of magnets.

* The [[Anamnesis (philosophy)|Theory of Recollection]] explains that we possess some non-empirical knowledge (e.g. The Form of Equality) at birth, implying the soul existed before birth to carry that knowledge. Another account of the theory is found in Plato's Meno, although in that case Socrates implies anamnesis (previous knowledge of everything) whereas he is not so bold in Phaedo.

* The [[Phaedo#The Affinity Argument|Affinity Argument]], explains that invisible, immortal, and incorporeal things are different from visible, mortal, and corporeal things. Our soul is of the former, while our body is of the latter, so when our bodies die and decay, our soul will continue to live.

* The [[Phaedo#The Argument from Form of Life|Argument from Form of Life]], or The Final Argument explains that the Forms, incorporeal and static entities, are the cause of all things in the world, and all things participate in Forms. For example, beautiful things participate in the Form of Beauty; the number four participates in the Form of the Even, etc. The soul, by its very nature, participates in the Form of Life, which means the soul can never die.

===Plotinus===
[[Plotinus]] offers a version of the argument that Kant calls "The Achilles of Rationalist Psychology". Plotinus first argues that the soul is [[Simple (philosophy)|simple]], then notes that a simple being cannot decompose. Many subsequent philosophers have argued both that the soul is simple and that it must be immortal. The tradition arguably culminates with [[Moses Mendelssohn]]'s [[Phaedon]].&lt;ref&gt;Henry, D. (2008) "The Neoplatonic Achilles" in "The Achilles of Rationalist Psychology". Springer. Volume 7 of the series Studies in the History of Philosophy of Mind pp 59-74.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metochites===
[[Theodore Metochites]] argues that part of the soul's nature is to move itself, but that a given movement will cease only if what causes the movement is separated from the thing moved – an impossibility if they are one and the same.&lt;ref name="metochites"&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/byzantine-philosophy/#ImmSou&lt;/ref&gt;

===Avicenna===
[[Avicenna]] argued for the distinctness of the soul and the body, and the incorruptibility of the former.&lt;ref&gt;Avicenna's Metaphysics: Al-Shifâ’, Al-Ilâhiyyât, ed. Mohammad Youssef Moussa, Solayman Dunya, Sa’id Zayed (Cairo, Organisme Général des Imprimeries Gouvernementales, 1960), II: 431–2; translated by A.J. Arberry, Aspects of Islamic Civilization (London, George Allen &amp; Unwin, 1964), p. 153. See too Jean R, Michot, La destinée de l’homme selon Avicenne (Louvain, Peeters, 1986), pp. 22–56, and particularly pp. 26–27, and 43; J. Janssens, “Ibn Sînâ's Ideas of ultimate Realities, Neoplatonism and the Qur’ân as Problem-Solving paradigms in the Avicennian System,” Ultimate Reality and Meaning 10 (1987), 259–261. Cf. too Michael Marmura's complete translation, Avicenna: The Metaphysics of the Healing, Provo, Utah, Brigham Young University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aquinas===
The full argument for the immortality of the soul and [[Thomas Aquinas]]' elaboration of Aristotelian theory is found in Question 75 of the First Part of the ''[[Summa Theologica]]''.&lt;ref&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aquinas/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Descartes===
[[René Descartes]] endorses the claim that the soul is simple, and also that this entails that it cannot decompose. Descartes does not address the possibility that the soul might suddenly disappear.&lt;ref&gt;Rozemond, M. (2010). "Descartes and the Immortality of the Soul". in Mind, Method and Morality: Essays in Honor of Anthony Kenny. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leibniz===
In early work, [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] endorses a version of the argument from the simplicity of the soul to its immortality, but like his predecessors, he does not address the possibility that the soul might suddenly disappear. In his [[monadology]] he advances a sophisticated novel argument for the immortality of monads.&lt;ref&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/leibniz/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moses Mendelssohn===
[[Moses Mendelssohn]]'s ''[[Phaedon]]'' is a defense of the simplicity and immortality of the soul. It is a series of three dialogues, revisiting the Platonic dialogue ''[[Phaedo]]'', in which [[Socrates]] argues for the immortality of the soul, in preparation for his own death. Many philosophers, including Plotinus, Descartes, and Leibniz, argue that the soul is simple, and that because simples cannot decompose they must be immortal. In the Phaedon, Mendelssohn addresses gaps in earlier versions of this argument (an argument that Kant calls the Achilles of Rationalist Psychology). The Phaedon contains an original argument for the simplicity of the soul, and also an original argument that simples cannot suddenly disappear. It contains further original arguments that the soul must retain its rational capacities as long as it exists.&lt;ref&gt;Sassen, B. (2008). "Kant and Mendelssohn on the Implications of the ‘I Think’ ".in "The Achilles of Rationalist Psychology". Springer. Volume 7 of the series Studies in the History of Philosophy of Mind pp 59-74.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethics==
{{See also|Life extension#Ethics and politics of life extension}}

The possibility of clinical immortality raises a host of medical, philosophical, and religious issues and ethical questions. These include [[persistent vegetative state]]s, the nature of personality over time, technology to mimic or copy the mind or its processes, [[Human enhancement#Inequality and Social Disruption|social and economic]] disparities created by [[longevity]], and survival of the [[heat death of the universe]].

===Undesirability===
Physical immortality has also been imagined as a form of eternal torment, as in [[Mary Shelley]]'s short story "The Mortal Immortal", the protagonist of which witnesses everyone he cares about dying around him. [[Jorge Luis Borges]] explored the idea that life gets its meaning from death in the short story "[[The Immortal (short story)|The Immortal]]"; an entire society having achieved immortality, they found time becoming infinite, and so found no motivation for any action. In his book ''Thursday's Fictions'', and the stage and film adaptations of it, [[Richard James Allen]] tells the story of a woman named Thursday who tries to cheat the cycle of reincarnation to get a form of eternal life. At the end of this fantastical tale, her son, Wednesday, who has witnessed the havoc his mother's quest has caused, forgoes the opportunity for immortality when it is offered to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poetrylibrary.edu.au/poems-book/thursday-s-fictions-0371000|title=Thursday's Fictions - Richard James Allen - Poems by book - Australian Poetry Library|publisher=|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the novel ''[[Tuck Everlasting]]'' depicts immortality as "falling off the wheel of life" and is viewed as a curse as opposed to a blessing. In the anime ''[[Casshern Sins]]'' humanity achieves immortality due to advances in medical technology; however, the inability of the human race to die causes Luna, a Messianic figure, to come forth and offer normal lifespans because she believed that without death, humans could not live. Ultimately, Casshern takes up the cause of death for humanity when Luna begins to restore humanity's immortality. In [[Anne Rice]]'s book series ''[[The Vampire Chronicles]]'', [[vampire]]s are portrayed as immortal and ageless, but their inability to cope with the changes in the world around them means that few vampires live for much more than a century, and those who do often view their changeless form as a curse.

In his book ''Death'', Yale philosopher [[Shelly Kagan]] argues that any form of human immortality would be undesirable. Kagan's argument takes the form of a dilemma. Either our characters remain essentially the same in an immortal afterlife, or they do not. If our characters remain basically the same—that is, if we retain more or less the desires, interests, and goals that we have now—then eventually, over an infinite stretch of time, we will get bored and find eternal life unbearably tedious. If, on the other hand, our characters are radically changed—e.g., by God periodically erasing our memories or giving us rat-like brains that never tire of certain simple pleasures—then such a person would be too different from our current self for us to care much what happens to them. Either way, Kagan argues, immortality is unattractive. The best outcome, Kagan argues, would be for humans to live as long as they desired and then to accept death gratefully as rescuing us from the unbearable tedium of immortality.&lt;ref&gt;Shelly Kagan, ''Death''. New Haven: Yale University Press, 2012, pp. 238-46. As Kagan notes, his argument is an adaptation of a similar argument given by the British philosopher [[Bernard Williams]] in his book ''Problems of the Self'' (1973).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sociology ==

If human beings were to achieve immortality, there would most likely be a change in the worlds' [[social structures]]. Sociologists argue that human beings' awareness of their own [[wikt:mortality|mortality]] shapes their behavior.&lt;ref&gt;[Dossey, Larry; In: Explore: The Journal of Science &amp; Healing; Mar/Apr2017; v.13. n.2, 81-87. 7p. (editorial) ISSN 1550-8307 {{PMID|28108110}}, Database: CINAHL Complete]&lt;/ref&gt;  With the advancements in medical technology in extending human life, there may need to be serious considerations made about future social structures. The world is already experiencing a global [[demographic shift]] of increasingly ageing populations with lower replacement rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=He, Goodkind, Kowal|first1=Wan, Daniel, Paul|title=An Aging World: 2015|journal=International Population Reports: U.S. Census Bureau|date=March 2016|volume=1|issue=16|page=1–30|url=census.gov|accessdate=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The social changes that are made to accommodate this new population shift may be able to offer insight on the possibility of an immortal society.

== Politics ==
Although some scientists state that radical life extension, delaying and stopping aging are achievable,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imminst.org/cureaging/|title=Scientists' Open Letter on Aging|publisher=|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; there are no international or national programs focused on stopping aging or on radical life extension. In 2012 in Russia, and then in the United States, Israel and the Netherlands, pro-immortality political parties were launched. They aimed to provide political support to anti-aging and radical life extension research and technologies and at the same time transition to the next step, radical life extension, life without aging, and finally, immortality and aim to make possible access to such technologies to most currently living people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fightaging.org/archives/2012/07/a-single-issue-political-party-for-longevity-science.php|title=A Single-Issue Political Party for Longevity Science|website=Fight Aging!|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbols==
[[File:Ankh-Symbol.svg|right|thumb|80px|The ankh]]

There are numerous symbols representing immortality. The [[ankh]] is an [[Egypt]]ian symbol of life that holds connotations of immortality when depicted in the hands of the [[:Category:Egyptian deities|gods]] and [[pharaoh]]s, who were seen as having control over the journey of life. The [[Möbius strip]] in the shape of a [[trefoil knot]] is another symbol of immortality. Most symbolic representations of infinity or the life cycle are often used to represent immortality depending on the context they are placed in. Other examples include the [[Ouroboros]], the Chinese fungus of longevity, the ''ten'' [[kanji]], the [[phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]], the [[peacock]] in Christianity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jesuswalk.com/christian-symbols/peacock.htm |author=Wilson, Ralph F. |title=Peacock as an Ancient Christian Symbol of Eternal Life |publisher=Jesus Walk Bible Study Series |accessdate=January 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the colors [[Amaranth (color)|amaranth]] (in [[Western culture]]) and [[Peach (color)|peach]] (in [[Chinese culture]]).

==Fiction==
{{Main|Immortality in fiction}}
Immortality is a popular subject in [[fiction]], as it explores humanity's deep-seated fears and comprehension of its own [[Death|mortality]]. Immortal beings and [[species]] abound in fiction, especially [[fantasy]] fiction, and the meaning of "immortal" tends to vary. The ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', one of the first literary works, is primarily a quest of a hero seeking to become immortal.&lt;ref name="Garreau"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Joel Garreau |authorlink=Joel Garreau |title=The Invincible Man |date=October 31, 2007 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/30/AR2007103002222_pf.html |pages=C01 |journal=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some fictional beings are completely immortal (or very nearly so) in that they are immune to death by injury, disease and age. Sometimes such powerful immortals can only be killed by each other, as is the case with the [[Q (Star Trek)|Q]] from the ''[[Star Trek]]'' series. Even if something can't be killed, a common plot device involves putting an immortal being into a slumber or limbo, as is done with [[Morgoth]] in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' and the Dreaming God of ''[[Pathways Into Darkness]]''. Storytellers often make it a point to give weaknesses to even the most indestructible of beings. For instance, [[Superman]] is supposed to be invulnerable, yet his enemies were able to exploit his now-infamous weakness: [[Kryptonite]]. (See also [[Achilles' heel]].)

Many fictitious species are said to be immortal if they cannot die of old age, even though they can be killed through other means, such as injury. Modern fantasy [[elf|elves]] often exhibit this form of immortality. Other creatures, such as [[vampire]]s and the immortals in the film ''[[Highlander (film)|Highlander]]'', can only die from [[beheading]]. The classic and stereotypical vampire is typically slain by one of several very specific means, including a [[silver bullet]] (or piercing with other silver weapons), a stake through the heart (perhaps made of consecrated wood), or by exposing them to sunlight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gods-and-monsters.com/how-to-kill-a-vampire.html|title=How To Kill a Vampire - The Only 5 Methods Known To Man|publisher=|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vampires.monstrous.com/killing_a_vampire.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120102231840/http://vampires.monstrous.com/killing_a_vampire.htm |archivedate=2012-01-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jennifer Aaker''' (born 1967, California) is an American social psychologist, author and General Atlantic Professor of Marketing at [[Stanford Graduate School of Business]]. Best known for her research on time, money and happiness,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cook|first=Nancy|title=The Corporate Pursuit of Happiness|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/1722637/corporate-pursuit-happiness|work=March, 2011|publisher=Fast Company|accessdate=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aaker also focuses on the transmission of ideas through social networks, the power of story in decision making, and how to build global brands across cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Brainiacs: Most Influential Women In Technology|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/women-in-tech/2011/brainiacs/jennifer-aaker|work=2011|publisher=Fast Company|accessdate=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Faculty Profile:  Jennifer Aaker|url=http://faculty-gsb.stanford.edu/aaker/|publisher=Stanford Graduate School of Business|accessdate=6 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is the recipient of the Distinguished Scientific Achievement Award from the [[Society for Consumer Psychology]] and the Stanford Distinguished Teaching Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jennifer Aaker: Psychology Today |url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/experts/jennifer-aaker |work=2014 |publisher=Psychology Today |accessdate=27 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306113958/http://www.psychologytoday.com/experts/jennifer-aaker |archivedate= 6 March 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Aaker was born in [[Palo Alto, California]], to Kay Aaker,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wake|first=Jennifer|title=The Gift of Time: Skilled Volunteers Found in Local Retirees|url=http://www.volunteereastbay.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/The_Gift_of_Time.pdf|work=April 15, 2009|publisher=La Morinda Weekly|accessdate=7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[David Aaker]], a professor and brand consultant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=David A. Aaker, Author Profile|url=http://authors.simonandschuster.com/David-A-Aaker/1451364|publisher=Simon and Schuster|accessdate=7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aaker attended the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where she studied under social psychologist [[Philip E. Tetlock]] and [[Nobel Prize]] winner [[Daniel Kahneman]], receiving a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in [[Psychology]] in 1989. In 1990, Aaker began postgraduate work at Stanford Graduate School of Business, earning a Ph.D. in marketing with a minor in psychology in 1995. Her dissertation on brand personality led to the publication of three academic papers  in ''Journal of Marketing Research'' and ''Journal of Consumer Research'' and won several awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Honors and Recognition |url=http://faculty.gsb.stanford.edu/aaker/documents/Aaker_Vita.pdf |work=2013 |publisher=Stanford University |accessdate=15 June 2013 }}{{dead link|date=April 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Aaker began her academic career in 1995 as an assistant professor at the [[UCLA Anderson School of Management]].  In 1999, she returned to the Stanford Graduate School of Business as an assistant professor, was promoted to associate professor in 2001, and earned a full professorship in 2004. In 2005, Aaker was named General Atlantic Professor of Marketing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aaker CV at Stanford Graduate School of Business |url=http://faculty-gsb.stanford.edu/aaker/documents/Aaker_Vita.pdf |work=January, 2013 |publisher=Stanford University |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130722150424/http://faculty-gsb.stanford.edu/aaker/documents/Aaker_Vita.pdf |archivedate=2013-07-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her work has been published in scholarly journals in psychology and marketing and has been highlighted in ''[[The Economist]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'', ''[[Bloomberg Businessweek|BusinessWeek]]'', ''[[Forbes]],'' [[NPR]], ''[[CBS MoneyWatch]]'', ''[[Inc. (magazine)|Inc.]]'' and ''[[Science (journal)|Science]].'' She serves as an advisory board member for several private companies.

As a social psychologist and marketer, Aaker began her research career by proposing a "Dimensions of Brand Personality" framework to describe and measure the "personality" of a brand, defined as the set of human characteristics associated with it. The five core dimensions are Sincerity, Excitement, Competence, Sophistication, and Ruggedness.  In a global analysis of brands, Aaker and her colleagues revealed two novel brand personality dimensions. In Japan, individuals viewed brands as Peaceful, and in Spain, individuals viewed brands as Passionate.  Aaker’s model showed that brand personality dimensions influence consumer preference and choice and provided a framework that illuminated how to build strong global brands that meet multi-cultural needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aaker|first=Jennifer|title=Dimensions of Brand Personality|date=August 1997|url=http://www.haas.berkeley.edu/groups/finance/Papers/Dimensions%20of%20BP%20JMR%201997.pdf|accessdate=16 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Aaker shifted her research focus to understanding time, money and happiness. In this work, she suggested that time is a resource that, like money, is not only important but more subjective than we think. In 2010, she published two papers with [[Sepandar Kamvar|Sep Kamvar]] and Cassie Mogilner on the dynamic meaning of happiness.  Prior research had suggested that the meaning of happiness is either similar across individuals, or highly subjective and idiosyncratic.  Aaker and her colleagues show that the answer lies between the two and that there is in fact a predictable shift in the meaning of happiness and how it is experienced over one's life and even within the day or week. The research also showed that the meaning of happiness that one holds impacts the choices people make.

Aaker has also examined questions such as why people give to others, how small acts create significant change, and how those effects can be fueled by social media.

In 2010, Aaker and her husband, startup advisor Andy Smith, authored the book ''The Dragonfly Effect:  Quick, Effective and Powerful Ways to Use Social Media to Drive Social Change.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Dragonfly Effect|url=http://www.dragonflyeffect.com/|work=2013|publisher=Official Website|accessdate=16 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;    With a title inspired by the dragonfly’s unique ability to propel itself in any direction when its four wings worked in concert, the book examined the manner in which synchronized ideas can be used to create rapid transformations through social media. A literary award winner,[5] ''The Dragonfly Effect'' has been translated into over 10 languages. In 2013, Aaker, Smith and McCarthy published ''The Power of Stories'', a companion to ''The Dragonfly Effect'', which further explored social media through psychological insight and provided a hands-on tool to help companies put the model to work.

In a real world demonstration of the Dragonfly Effect, Aaker and her students founded 100K Cheeks,.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=David|first=Avril|title=Names You Need to Know|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/avrildavid/2011/05/17/names-you-need-to-know-the-dragonfly-effect/|work=May 17, 2011|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=16 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Power of Stores|ISBN=1484184386}}&lt;/ref&gt;  an organization dedicated to registering 100,000 South Asian donors in the National Bone Marrow Registry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Past Challenges (Get Involved) |url=http://studentaffairs.stanford.edu/haas/100kcheeks |publisher=Haas Center for Public Service |accessdate=13 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221230214/http://studentaffairs.stanford.edu/haas/100kcheeks |archivedate=21 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;   In addition to utilizing social networks, Aaker ran the first ever cheek swab in India; as a result of these efforts, 100K Cheeks exceeded their goal by registering more than 115,000 potential donors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jennifer Aaker: Pursuit of Happiness|url=http://www.inktalks.com/discover/53/pursuit-of-happiness|work=November 27, 2011|publisher=Ink Talks|accessdate=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beth Kanter Katie Delahaye Paine|first=Katie Delahaye Paine|title=Measuring the Networked Nonprofit: Using Data to Change the World|year=2012|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|isbn=978-1-118-13760-4|url=https://books.google.com/?id=vL_lhYF0Uf4C&amp;pg=PT36&amp;lpg=PT36&amp;dq=jennifer+aaker+100k+cheeks}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Dragonfly Effect|url=http://www.ssireview.org/articles/entry/the_dragonfly_effect|work=October 2011|publisher=Stanford Social Innovation Review|accessdate=16 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Social media is not inherently meaningful," Aaker said in an interview on the subject.

Born in [[Kouvola]], Finland, he studied at [[Sibelius Academy]] and [[Berklee College of Music]].&lt;ref name="bej"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Feather|first1=Leonard|last2=Gitler|first2=Ira|title=The Biographical Encyclopedia of Jazz|date=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|isbn=9780195320008|page=3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B4EjDgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=28 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began playing professionally at the end of the 1950s. He played in a sextet led by [[Heikki Rosendahl]] during that time, and then studied flute performance at the [[Sibelius Academy]] and in the U.S. at the [[Berklee College of Music]].&lt;ref name="New Grove" /&gt; Moving back to Finland, he settled in [[Helsinki]] and began working both as a [[session musician]] and with [[jazz fusion|fusion]] groups. Later in the 1960s he formed a duo with [[Edward Vesala]], as well as in the group [[Eero Koivistoinen]] for four years. He played with [[Tasavallan Presidentti]] in their earlier days, including for their first, eponymous, album. He recorded with [[Thad Jones]] and [[Mel Lewis]] and with [[Heikki Sarmanto]] in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and his first album as a soloist, ''Etiquette'', was released in 1974.

In 1975, he became a member of the [[New Music Orchestra]], and worked with the [[Nordic All Stars]], [[Arild Andersen]], and [[Peter Brötzmann]] later in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="RCJE"/&gt; The 1980s saw him working with the [[UFO Big Band]], [[Jan Garbarek]], [[Charlie Mariano]], and others. He was granted a 15-year state grant from Finland in the mid-1980s. In 1983 he rejoined Tasavallan Presidentti, and has recorded and toured with them since. He led a touring quartet from 1990 to 1992 with [[Olli Ahvenlahti]], [[Heikki Virtanen]] and [[Reino Laine]]. Aaltonen and [[Heikki Sarmanto]] released a duo recording, ''Rise'', in 2001; in 2003 Aaltonen's trio album ''Mother Tongue'' won a Jazz-Emma in Finland. Aaltonen continues to teach at the annual [[Nilsiä]] Music Camp.

'''Last words''' or '''final words''' are a person's final articulated words, stated prior to [[death]] or as death approaches. Last words may not necessarily be written down or accurately recorded, and they may not be quoted accurately for a variety of reasons.

==Famous last words==
{{see also|List of last words}}
Famous last words include both the literal utterings; such as the [[sayings of Jesus on the cross]], from Shakespeare's ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' "''[[Et tu, Brute?]]''", and the [[Irony|ironical]] sense of words said before a disaster, such as:
* "They couldn't hit an elephant at this distance!" General [[John Sedgwick]] at the [[Battle of Spotsylvania Court House]] immediately before being killed by enemy fire.&lt;ref&gt;Foote, Shelby. ''The Civil War: A Narrative. vol. 3, Red River to Appomattox''. New York: Random House, 1974. {{ISBN|0-394-74913-8}}. p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Let all brave Prussians follow me!" Field Marshal [[Kurt Christoph Graf von Schwerin]] at the [[Battle of Prague (1757)|Battle of Prague]], immediately before getting hit in the head by a cannonball.&lt;ref&gt;Percy, S. (1856). ''The Percy Anecdotes'': Revised edition... New York City, NY: Harper &amp; Brothers. p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Don't worry about it ... look, the clip is not even in it." [[Terry Kath]] of the band [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]], just before putting a pistol to his temple and pulling the trigger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.premierguitar.com/articles/Forgotten_Heroes_Terry_Kath|title=Forgotten Heroes: Terry Kath|first=Corbin|last=Reiff|journal=Premier Guitar|date=May 11, 2013|accessdate=June 6, 2014|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "The battle is at its height. Beat my war drums. Do not announce my death". Admiral [[Yi Sun-sin]] died from a gunshot wound at the naval [[Battle of Noryang]] on December 16, 1598.

The last words reported to have been uttered by a person revered as a martyr or hero of a religious, nationalist, or revolutionary movement often gain a political significance and are extensively quoted in later literature and/or used as a slogan. However, in many such cases their historical authenticity is doubted.{{cn|date=August 2013}}

'''Lee William Aaker''' (born September 25, 1943)&lt;ref name="Goldrup"&gt;Goldrup, Tom &amp; Goldrup, Jim (2002) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=3PsGWOPQtKQC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=%22lee+aaker%22&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22lee%20aaker%22&amp;f=false Growing Up on the Set: Interviews with 39 Former Child Actors of Classic Film and Television]'', McFarland &amp; Co Inc, {{ISBN|978-0-7864-1254-9}}, p. 5-12&lt;/ref&gt; is an American former [[child actor]] known for his appearance as Rusty "B-Company" in the television program ''[[The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin]]''.

== Film ==
On television as a young child, he started appearing uncredited at the age of 8 in films such as ''[[The Greatest Show on Earth (film)|The Greatest Show on Earth]]'' (1952) and ''[[High Noon]]'' (1952).&lt;ref name="Goldrup" /&gt; He quickly moved to featured status by the end of that year.

He showed talent as the kidnapped Indian "Red Chief" in a segment of the film ''[[O. Henry's Full House]]'' (1952) and another kidnap victim as the son of scientist [[Gene Barry]] in ''[[The Atomic City]]'' (1952).

In 1953, he co-starred in the [[John Wayne]] [[Western (genre)|western]] classic ''[[Hondo (film)|Hondo]]'' (1953) as the [[curious]] [[blond]] son of homesteader [[Geraldine Page]].&lt;ref name="Goldrup" /&gt;

He also appeared in other film styles such as the ''[[film noir]]'' thriller ''[[Jeopardy (film)|Jeopardy]]'' (1953) with [[Barbara Stanwyck]], the horse opera drama ''Arena'' (1953) with [[Gig Young]], and the comedies ''[[Mister Scoutmaster]]'' (1953) with [[Clifton Webb]] and ''[[Ricochet Romance]]'' (1954) with [[Marjorie Main]].

== Television ==
In 1953-54, Aaker was among the many child actors who auditioned for the role of "Jeff Miller" on the original 1954 ''[[Lassie (1954 TV series)|Lassie]]'' series, which later aired as ''Jeff's Collie''. That role went to [[Tommy Rettig]]. Two weeks later, Aaker won the role of "Rusty" on ''The Adventures of Rin-Tin-Tin'', co-starring [[James Brown (Rin Tin Tin)|James Brown]] (1920–1992) as [[Lieutenant]] Ripley "Rip" Masters.&lt;ref name="Goldrup" /&gt; Aaker and Rettig were friends, and both shows were popular with audiences. The two actors and the two star dogs appeared together in a photograph used on the cover of the July 2, 1955 issue of ''[[TV Guide]]''.{{r|rtt|page1=236}}

== Later years ==
Aaker told a newspaper reporter that when he reached the age of 21, he was paid a $10,000 lump sum by the studio that produced ''Rin Tin Tin'' "and he spent the rest of the '60s traveling around the world 'as sort of a flower child.'"&lt;ref name="si"&gt;{{cite news|title=Rin Tin Tin's friend is now a carpenter|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/85252305/?terms=%22Lee%2BAaker%22|work=Southern Illinoisan|date=November 15, 1976|location=Illinois, Carbondale|page=18|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = November 30, 2016}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unable to find work as an adult actor, Aaker got involved as a producer and later worked as a carpenter.&lt;ref name="Goldrup" /&gt;

==Personal life==
In the late 1960s, Aaker was married to Sharon Ann Hamilton for two years.&lt;ref name=xcs/&gt; He has resided in [[Mammoth Lakes, California|Mammoth Lakes]], [[California]], for many years and is a special-needs ski instructor.&lt;ref name="Goldrup" /&gt;

==Recognition==
In 2005, Aaker won the [[Golden Boot Awards|Golden Boot Award]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Golden Boot Awards|url=http://www.b-westerns.com/goldboot.htm|website=The Old Corral|accessdate=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as  ''Kids of the West''.

'' ''' Les Dialogues d’Evhémère''' '' ('The Dialogues of [[Euhemerus]]') is a little-known philosophical dialogue by [[Voltaire]], published in 1777. At the time of its writing he was 83 years old and knew that he was coming to the end of his life:&lt;ref name="Vermeer"/&gt; the work is a kind of philosophical testament.  Like many other works by Voltaire, it is written in the tradition of Socratic dialogue, where the interlocutors seek the truth together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Banderier |first1=Gilles |title=Voltaire en dialogues |journal=Acta fabula |date=May 2006 |volume=7 |issue=2 |url=http://www.fabula.org/acta/document1332.php |accessdate=8 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments==
The imagined dialogue takes place between two historical figures, Euhemerus and Callicrates. Euhemerus, a [[Stoic]], was a contemporary of [[Alexander the Great]], remembered mostly for his view that the Classical Greek gods had originally been people, deified long after their deaths by their followers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Meurger |first1=Michel |title=Evhémère et les monstres. Croyances populaires et interprétation instruite |url=https://www.hommes-et-faits.com/lime/MMeurger_Monsters_.htm |website=Hommes et faits.com |accessdate=8 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Callicrates was also a philosopher, from the third century BC, of whom little is known but whom Voltaire makes an [[Epicurean]]. His views, including [[atheism]], are meant to represent the views of Voltaire's contemporaries [[Holbach]], [[La Mettrie]] and [[Diderot]].

In the dialogue as in historic reality Euhemeros had enjoyed a life of travel, much of it following Alexander; Callicrates is curious to know what his friend has learned as a result of these experiences. The conversations that follow are set out in twelve dialogues:&lt;ref name="Vermeer"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Vermeer-Pardoen |first1=Hannie |title=Voltaire De dialogen van Euhemeros Het nut van de filosofie |date=2017 |publisher=Gennep B.V., Uitgeverij Van |location=Amsterdam |isbn=978-9461648594 |url=https://cbonline.boekhuis.nl/pls/cover/p_get_cover_fe?p_hash=0030284E59D1F5E446B902E37A7BB78D |accessdate=8 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7–8}}

}}

There are two main themes in the dialogues. The first six consider metaphysical questions such as whether we have a soul, whether God exists and, if he does, who is responsible for all the misery on earth. And the last six dialogues are about natural philosophy and the material world -  what we know about the cosmos, the earth, the creation of mountains, and the generation of new life. What all the dialogues have in common is an  appeal for modesty and restraint in argument. There is little we can undubitably know and much is hidden from us. For this reason, whatever we may believe, we should never ignore evidence or assumptions from outside the universe of our beliefs; rather than proclaiming dogmas we should engage in dialogue. At the same time, Euhemerus is unsparing in his attacks on atheists, atomists and materialists as well as on religious dogma - all of which he terms 'madness, misery and crime'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=de Baar |first1=Marinus |title=Niets dan waanzin, ellende en misdaad |url=https://www.trouw.nl/home/niets-dan-waanzin-ellende-en-misdaad~a275ddc5/ |website=trouw.nl |publisher=de Persgroep Nederland B.V. |accessdate=10 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dialogues offer an overview of Voltaire's life of thought. Euhemerus is effectively Voltaire's mouthpiece; he has seen the follies, delusions and misery of mankind. Much of the dialogue focuses on paradox of God's goodness and the misery on earth. Euhemerus draws hope from scientific progress that points to a future world built on rationality. Eventually Callicrates decides to embark on a journey of his own to the barbarian lands from which his friend had learned so much.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dialogues d'Evhémère - Voltaire (1779) |url=https://www.boekmeter.nl/book/38450 |website=Boekmeter.nl |accessdate=10 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Censorship and the first edition==
Voltaire's 94-page autographed manuscript still survives (pages 37–40 are not in his hand).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Receuil factice d'ouvrages et fragments autographes de Voltaire |url=http://w3public.ville-ge.ch/bge/volage.nsf/Attachments/ms01frameset.htm/$file/ms01.pdf |website=w3public.ville-ge.ch|publisher=Bibliothèque de Genève, Institut et Musée Voltaire |accessdate=9 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However Voltaire's surviving correspondence makes no reference to the work, its development, or the ideas it elaborates.&lt;ref name="Cairn"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Paillard |first1=Christophe |title=La correspondance de Voltaire et l’édition de ses œuvres. problème de méthodologie éditoriale |journal=Revue d'Histoire Litteraire de la France |date=2012 |volume=112 |pages=859–872 |doi=10.3917/rhlf.124.0859 |url=https://www.cairn.info/revue-d-histoire-litteraire-de-la-france-2012-4-page-859.htm |accessdate=8 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise [[Friedrich Melchior, Baron von Grimm|Grimm]] does not mention it. The ''[[Mémoires secrets]]'' from November 1777 did refer to the work however, and a comment from [[Jean-Louis Wagnière]] indicated that the ''Dialogues'' had been published only shortly before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Oeuvres de Voltaire avec préfaces, avvertissement, notes ... par m. Beuchot: Mélanges. Tome 14|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t1WHuzF7XrQC&amp;pg=PA146|year=1834|publisher=Lefèvre|page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the course of his life Voltaire had had his works condemned or banned by royal censors in France on many occasions.  He also had a number of ways of avoiding censorship - including arranging for his work to be printed outside France, and having it printed anonymously so he could deny authorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Birkenstock |first1=Jane |title=Château de Cirey, Residence of Voltaire |url=http://www.visitvoltaire.com/voltaire_bio.htm |website=www.visitvoltaire.com |publisher=Château de Cirey |accessdate=9 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Davidson2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ian Davidson|title=Voltaire: A Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hFU0CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT32|date=12 March 2012|publisher=Pegasus Books|isbn=978-1-68177-039-0|pages=32–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the presentation of challenging or radical ideas in the form of a dialogue was one method of bringing unconventional ideas to public attention while being less likely to have the word altered or suppressed.&lt;ref name="Collins2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=James Daniel Collins|title=Interpreting Modern Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=olt9BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA87|date=8 March 2015|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-6788-2|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The frontispiece of the first known edition of the ''Dialogues d'Evhémère'' indicates that it was published in London by Voltaire not in 1777 as suggested by the ''Mémoires secrets'' but in 1779 (i.e. the year after Voltaire's death), but does not name a publisher.  In fact it is evident from the distinctive typography used that it was printed not in London but in [[Lausanne]], by Abraham-Louis Tarin, who worked for the publisher François Grasset.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Livre Dialogues d'Evhémère / par M. de Voltaire |url=https://explore.rero.ch/fr_CH/rero/result/L/VlRMU19SRVJPUjAwNDMzMzQ5NQ== |website=explore.rero.ch |publisher=Réseau des bibliothèques de Suisse occidentale |accessdate=9 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grasset is noted for having previously published a number of works attacking Voltaire as well as for having on several occasions clashed with him over the intended publication of Voltaire's works from unauthorised manuscript versions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Chatelard |first1=Marie-Claire |title=François GRASSET (1722-1789) |url=http://dictionnaire-journalistes.gazettes18e.fr/journaliste/359-francois-grasset |website=dictionnaire-journalistes.gazettes18e.fr |publisher=IHRIM UMR &amp; ISH USR |accessdate=9 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2612">'''Metachirality''' is a stronger form of [[chirality]].
It applies to objects or systems that are [[chiral]] (not identical to their [[mirror image]]) and where, in addition, their mirror image has a [[symmetry group]] that differs from the symmetry group of the original object or system.&lt;ref&gt;Conway, John H.; Burgiel, Heidi; Goodman-Strauss, Chaim (2008). ''The Symmetries of Things'', p. 353. A K Peters Ltd., London. {{ISBN|978 1 56881 220 5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many familiar chiral objects, like the capital letter 'Z' embedded in the plane, are not metachiral.
The symmetry group of the capital letter 'Z' embedded in the plane consists of the [[identity transformation]] and a rotation over 180˚ (a half turn).
In this case, the mirror image has the same symmetry group.
In particular, asymmetric objects (that only have the identity transformation as symmetry, like a human hand) are not metachiral,
since the mirror image is also asymmetric.
In general, two-dimensional objects and bounded three-dimensional objects are not metachiral.

An example of a metachiral object is an infinite [[helical staircase]].
A [[helix]] in 3D has a ''handedness'' (either left or right, like [[screw thread]]), whereby it differs from its mirror image.
An infinite helical staircase, however, does have symmetries:
[[screw operation]]s, that is, a combination of a [[translation]] and a [[rotation]].
The symmetry group of the mirror image of an infinite helical staircase also contains screw operations.
But they are of the opposite handedness and, hence,
the symmetry groups differ.
Note, however, that these symmetry groups are [[isomorphic]].

Of the 219 [[space group]]s, 11 are metachiral.
A nice example of a metachiral spatial structure is the [[Laves_graph|K&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; crystal]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Toshikazu Sunada|Sunada, Toshikazu]] (Feb. 2008). "Crystals That Nature Might Miss Creating", ''Notices of the AMS'', Volume 55, Number 2, pages 208-215. [http://www.newton.ac.uk/preprints/NI07042.pdf preprint]&lt;/ref&gt; also known as Triamond,
and featured in the ''Bamboozle'' mathematical artwork.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.win.tue.nl/bamboozle Bamboozle: A Mathematical Artwork in MetaForum]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mika Aaltonen''' (born 16 November 1965) is a [[Finland|Finnish]] former [[association football|footballer]]. His position was an attacking central midfielder. He also played for the [[Finland national football team|Finnish national team]].

During his career (1982–1994) he played in [[Finland]], [[Italy]], [[Switzerland]], [[Germany]], and [[Israel]] for [[Turun Palloseura|TPS]], [[F.C. Internazionale Milano|Internazionale]], [[AC Bellinzona|Bellinzona]], [[Bologna F.C. 1909|Bologna]], [[Hertha BSC]], [[Hapoel Be'er Sheva F.C.]] and [[Tampereen Pallo-Veikot]]. He finished his career at a relatively young age because of a persistent ankle injury, and because of this, he ended up concentrating more on his studies. Aaltonen studied throughout his playing career, and after he retired from football, he earned a doctorate degree in economics.

Aaltonen is best remembered for a superb goal scored against Italian goalkeeper [[Walter Zenga]] in [[UEFA Cup]] in 1987 during a match between [[Turun Palloseura]] and [[F.C. Internazionale Milano|Inter Milan]] at the [[San Siro]] stadium in [[Milan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.helsinkitimes.fi/htimes/sport/4638-the-miracle-of-san-siro.pdf | title = Helsinki Times}}{{Dead link|date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This goal more or less earned him a transfer to Inter shortly afterwards.

''nanobacteria'' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|n|æ|n|oʊ|b|æ|k|ˈ|t|ɪər|i|ə}} {{respell|NAN|oh|bak|TEER|ee|ə}}) is the unit or member name of a proposed class of living [[organism]]s, specifically [[cell wall|cell-walled]] [[microorganisms]] with a size much smaller than the generally accepted lower limit for life (about 200 [[nanometer|nm]] for [[Bacteria#Morphology|bacteria]], like [[Mycoplasma pneumoniae#Cell biology|mycoplasma]]). Originally based on observed nano-scale structures in geological formations ([[Allan Hills 84001|including one meteorite]]), the status of nanobacteria has been controversial, with some researchers suggesting they are a new class of living organism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kajander E |title=Nanobacteria—propagating calcifying nanoparticles |journal=Lett Appl Microbiol |volume=42 |issue=6 |pages=549–52 |year=2006 |pmid=16706890 |doi=10.1111/j.1472-765X.2006.01945.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ciftcioglu N, McKay D, Mathew G, Kajander E |title=Nanobacteria: fact or fiction?

==1981–2000==
In 1981 Torella and Morita described very small cells called [[ultramicrobacteria]]. Defined as being smaller than 300&amp;nbsp;nm, by 1982 MacDonell and Hood found that some could pass through a 200&amp;nbsp;nm membrane. Early in 1989, geologist Robert L. Folk found what he later identified as ''nannobacteria'' (written with double "n"), that is, nanoparticles isolated from geological specimens&lt;ref&gt;A convention has been adopted between researchers to name -or spell- the nanoparticles isolated from geological specimens as ''nannobacteria'', and those from biological specimens as ''nanobacteria''.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[travertine]] from hot springs of [[Viterbo]], Italy.  Initially searching for a bacterial cause for travertine deposition, [[scanning electron microscope]] examination of the mineral where no bacteria were detectable revealed extremely small objects which appeared to be biological.&lt;!-- 1989 find: Dark Life, pg 44 --&gt;  His first oral presentation elicited what he called "mostly a stony silence", at the 1992 [[Geological Society of America]]'s annual convention.&lt;ref name="Folk1997"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://naturalscience.com/ns/articles/01-03/ns_folk.html|title=Nanobacteria: surely not figments, but what under heaven are they?|last=Folk|first=Robert L.|date=March 4, 1997|publisher=naturalSCIENCE|accessdate=2008-12-20|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209035746/http://naturalscience.com/ns/articles/01-03/ns_folk.html|archivedate=December 9, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed that nanobacteria are the principal agents of precipitation of all minerals and crystals on Earth formed in liquid water, that they also cause all oxidation of metals, and that they are abundant in many biological specimens.&lt;ref name="Folk1997" /&gt;

In 1996, NASA scientist [[David S. McKay|David McKay]] published a study suggesting the existence of nanofossils — fossils of Martian nanobacteria — in [[ALH84001]], a meteorite originating from Mars and found in Antarctica.&lt;ref name="life"&gt;{{cite journal |last=McKay |first=David S. |year=1996 |title=Search for Past Life on Mars: Possible Relic Biogenic Activity in Martian Meteorite ALH84001 |journal=Science |volume=273 |issue=5277 |pages=924–930 |doi=10.1126/science.273.5277.924 |url=|pmid=8688069 |bibcode=1996Sci...273..924M|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Nanobacterium sanguineum'' was proposed in 1998 as an explanation of certain kinds of pathologic [[calcification]] ([[apatite]] in [[kidney stone]]s) by [[Finland|Finnish]] researcher [[Olavi Kajander]] and [[Turkey (country)|Turkish]] researcher [[Neva Ciftcioglu]], working at the [[University of Kuopio]] in Finland. According to the researchers the particles [[Self-replication|self-replicated]] in [[microbiological culture]], and the researchers further reported having identified [[DNA]] in these structures by staining.&lt;ref name=Kajander&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kajander E, Ciftçioglu N |title=Nanobacteria: An alternative mechanism for pathogenic intra- and extracellular calcification and stone formation |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/95/14/8274 |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=95 |issue=14 |pages=8274–9 |year=1998 |pmid=9653177 |doi=10.1073/pnas.95.14.8274 |pmc=20966|bibcode = 1998PNAS...95.8274K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A paper published in 2000 by a team led by an [[National Institutes of Health|NIH]] scientist [[John Cisar]] further tested these ideas. It stated that what had previously been described as "self-replication" was a form of [[Crystal structure|crystalline]] growth. The only DNA detected in his specimens was identified as coming from the bacteria ''[[Phyllobacterium myrsinacearum]]'', which is a common contaminant in PCR reactions.&lt;ref name=Cisar &gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cisar J, Xu D, Thompson J, Swaim W, Hu L, Kopecko D |title=An alternative interpretation of nanobacteria-induced biomineralization |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/97/21/11511 |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=97 |issue=21 |pages=11511–5 |year=2000 |pmid=11027350 |doi=10.1073/pnas.97.21.11511 |pmc=17231 |bibcode=2000PNAS...9711511C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2001–present==
In 2004 a [[Mayo Clinic]] team led by Franklin Cockerill, John Lieske, and Virginia M. Miller, reported to have isolated nanobacteria from diseased human [[artery|arteries]] and [[kidney stone]]s. Their results were published in 2004 and 2006 respectively.&lt;ref name=mayo1 &gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Miller V, Rodgers G, Charlesworth J, Kirkland B, Severson S, Rasmussen T, Yagubyan M, Rodgers J, Cockerill F, Folk R, Rzewuska-Lech E, Kumar V, Farell-Baril G, Lieske J |title=Evidence of nanobacterial-like structures in calcified human arteries and cardiac valves |url=http://ajpheart.physiology.org/cgi/content/full/287/3/H1115 |journal=Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol |volume=287 |issue=3 |pages=H1115–24 |year=2004 |pmid=15142839 |doi=10.1152/ajpheart.00075.2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mayo2 &gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Kumar V, Farell G, Yu S, etal |title=Cell biology of pathologic renal calcification: contribution of crystal transcytosis, cell-mediated calcification, and nanoparticles |journal=J.

Dr. Puskás identified these particles in cultures obtained from human atherosclerotic aortic walls and blood samples of atherosclerotic patients but the group was unable to detect DNA in these samples.&lt;ref name=puskas &gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Puskás L, Tiszlavicz L, Rázga Z, Torday L, Krenács T, Papp J |title=Detection of nanobacteria-like particles in human atherosclerotic plaques |journal=Acta Biol Hung |volume=56 |issue=3–4 |pages=233–45 |year=2005 |pmid=16196199 |doi=10.1556/ABiol.56.2005.3-4.7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Ciftcioglu and her research team at [[NASA]] used a rotating [[cell culture]] flask, which simulates some aspects of low-gravity conditions, to culture nanobacteria suspected of rapidly forming kidney stones in astronauts. In this environment, they were found to multiply five times faster than in normal Earth gravity. The study concluded that nanobacteria might have a potential role in forming kidney stones and may need to be screened for in crews pre-flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ciftçioglu N, Haddad R, Golden D, Morrison D, McKay D |title=A potential cause for kidney stone formation during space flights: enhanced growth of nanobacteria in microgravity |journal=Kidney Int |volume=67 |issue=2 |pages=483–91 |year=2005 |pmid=15673296 |doi=10.1111/j.1523-1755.2005.67105.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The February 2008 ''Public Library of Science (PLoS) Pathogens'' article focused on the comprehensive characterization of nanobacteria. The authors say that their results rule out the existence of nanobacteria as [[Life|living]] entities and that they are instead a unique [[Plant propagation|self-propagating]] entity, namely self-propagating mineral-[[fetuin]] complexes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Raoult D, Drancourt M, Azza S, etal |title=Nanobacteria Are Mineralo Fetuin Complexes |journal=PLoS Pathog. |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=e41 |date=February 2008 |pmid=18282102 |pmc=2242841 |doi=10.1371/journal.ppat.0040041 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An April 2008 ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS)'' article also reported that blood nanobacteria are not living organisms and stated that "CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; precipitates prepared ''in vitro'' are remarkably similar to purported nanobacteria in terms of their uniformly sized, membrane-delineated vesicular shapes, with cellular division-like formations and aggregations in the form of colonies."&lt;ref name="Martel J, Young JD 2008 5549–54"/&gt; The growth of such "biomorphic" inorganic precipitates was studied in detail in a 2009 ''Science'' paper, which showed that unusual crystal growth mechanisms can produce [[witherite]] precipitates from barium chloride and silica solutions that closely resemble primitive organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=García-Ruiz JM, Melero-García E, Hyde ST |title=Morphogenesis of self-assembled nanocrystalline materials of barium carbonate and silica |journal=Science |volume=323 |issue=5912 |pages=362–5 |date=January 2009 |pmid=19150841 |doi=10.1126/science.1165349 |url=http://garciaruiz.com/biomorphs/Science_2009_files/Morphogenesis%20of%20Self-Assembled%20Nanocrystalline_JM_science_2009_1.pdf|bibcode = 2009Sci...323..362G }}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors commented on the close resemblance of these crystals to putative nanobacteria, stating that their results showed that evidence for life cannot rest on morphology alone.

Further work on the importance of nanobacteria in geology by R. L. Folk and co-workers includes study of calcium carbonate Bahama ooids,&lt;ref&gt;Folk, RL and Lynch.

This suggests a commonality of origin. At least for the type locality at Viterbo, Italy, the biogenicity of these minute cells has been supported by transmission electron microscopy (TEM).&lt;ref&gt;Kirkland, B and Lynch, FL (2005) nanobacteria, Big Foot and the Loch Ness Monster—what are you supposed to believe?, Geological Society of America, abs. with progr., v. 37:253.&lt;/ref&gt; Slices through a green bioslime showed entities from 0.4 down to as small as 0.09&amp;nbsp;μm with definite cell walls and interior dots resembling ribosomes; and even smaller objects with cell walls and lucent interiors with diameters of 0.05&amp;nbsp;μm.&lt;ref&gt;Folk, RL and Kirkland, B, (2007) On the smallness of life: new TEM evidence from biofilm in hot springs, Viterbo, Italy, Geological Society of America, abs. with proper., v. 39 (6) 421.&lt;/ref&gt; Culturable organisms on earth are the same 0.05&amp;nbsp;μm size as the supposed nanobacteria on Mars.&lt;ref&gt;Folk, RL and Taylor, L (2002) nanobacterial alteration of pyroxenes in Martian meteorite ALH84001, Meteorology and Planetary Science, v. 37:1057-1070.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Testudo horsfieldii locking into the camera.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Some tortoises show negligible senescence.]]
'''Negligible senescence''' is a term coined by [[biogerontology|biogerontologist]] [[Caleb Finch]] to denote organisms that do not exhibit evidence of [[senescence]] (biological aging), such as measurable reductions in their reproductive capability, measurable functional decline, or rising death rates with age.&lt;ref name=FinchLSG&gt;{{cite book |last1=Finch |first1=Caleb |title=Longevity, Senescence and the Genome |date=1994 |publisher=.  University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago, IL |pages=206-247 |chapter=Negligible Senescence}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many examples of species for whose organisms scientists have not detected an increase in mortality rate after maturity.&lt;ref name=FinchLSG/&gt; This may mean that the lifespan of the organism is so long that researchers' subjects have not yet lived up to the time when a measure of the species' longevity can be made. Turtles, for example, were once thought to lack senescence, but more extensive observations have found evidence of decreasing fitness with age.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Study of negligibly senescent animals may provide clues that lead to better understanding of the aging process&lt;ref name=FinchLSG/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Guerin | first1 = J | year = 2004 | title = Emerging area of aging research: long-lived animals with "negligible senescence" | url = | journal = Ann N Y Acad Sci | volume = 1019 | issue = | pages = 518–20 | doi=10.1196/annals.1297.096 | pmid=15247078}}&lt;/ref&gt; and influence [[evolution of aging|theories of aging]]. The phenomenon of negligible senescence in some animals is a traditional argument for attempting to achieve similar negligible senescence in humans by technological means.

There are also organisms{{which|date=January 2017}} that exhibit negative senescence, whereby mortality chronologically decreases as the organism ages, for all or part of the life cycle, in disagreement with the [[Gompertz–Makeham law of mortality]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0262-4079(07)62033-8 |title=Evolution's greatest mistakes |year=2007 |author=Ainsworth, C |journal=New Scientist |volume=195 |pages=36–39 |last2=Lepage |first2=M|issue=2616}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see also [[Late-life mortality deceleration]]). Furthermore, there are species that have been observed to regress to a larval state and regrow into adults multiple times, such as ''[[Turritopsis dohrnii]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://8e.devbio.com/preview_article.php?ch=2&amp;id=6 |title=Cheating Death: The Immortal Life Cycle of '&amp;#39;Turritopsis'&amp;#39; |publisher=8e.devbio.com |accessdate=2010-03-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402085711/http://8e.devbio.com/preview_article.php?ch=2&amp;id=6 |archivedate=2010-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent studies have indicated a connection between phenomena related to negligible senescence and the general stability of an organism's [[genome]], specifically [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] processes, over its lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kogan|first1=Valeria|first2=Ivan|last2=Molodtcov|first3=Leonid I.|last3=Menshikov|first4=Robert J.|last4=Shmookler Reis|first5=Peter|last5=Fedichev|title=Stability analysis of a model gene network links aging, stress resistance, and negligible senescence|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=5|year=2015|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/srep13589|doi=10.1038/srep13589|pages=13589|pmid=26316217|pmc=4551969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In plants==
In plants, [[aspen]] trees are one example of [[biological immortality]]. Each individual tree can live for 40–150 years above ground, but the [[root]] system of the [[clonal colony]] is long-lived. In some cases, this is for thousands of years, sending up new trunks as the older trunks die off above ground. One such colony in [[Utah]], given the nickname of [[Pando (Quaking Aspen)|"Pando"]], is estimated to be 80,000 years old, making it possibly the [[list of long-living organisms|oldest living colony]] of aspens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/brca/naturescience/quakingaspen.htm Quaking Aspen] by the [[Bryce Canyon]] [[National Park Service]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The world's oldest known living non-[[Vegetative cloning|clonal]] organism was the [[Methuselah (tree)|Methuselah tree]] of the species ''[[Pinus longaeva]]'' growing high in the [[White Mountains (California)|White Mountains]] of [[Inyo County, California|Inyo County]] in eastern [[California]], aged {{Age as of date|4789|1957|August|5}} years.&lt;ref name=database&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.conifers.org/pi/Pinus_longaeva.php |title= ''Pinus longaeva'' |accessdate= 2008-06-20 |publisher= Gymnosperm Database|date= March 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This record was superseded in 2012 by another Great Basin bristlecone pine located in the same region as Methuselah, and was estimated to be 5062 years old. The tree was sampled by Edmund Schulman and dated by Tom Harlan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.rmtrr.org/oldlist.htm |title=OLDLIST, a database of old trees |last=Brown |first=Peter M |date=2012 |publisher=Rocky Mountain Tree-Ring Research, Inc. |access-date=2017-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In bacteria==
Among [[bacteria]], individual organisms are vulnerable and can easily die, but on the level of the [[Colony (biology)|colony]], bacteria can live indefinitely. The two daughter bacteria resulting from [[cell division]] of a parent bacterium can be regarded as unique individuals or as members of a biologically “immortal” colony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chao|first=Lin|author2=Guttman, David S.|title=A Model for Damage Load and Its Implications for the Evolution of Bacterial Aging|journal=PLoS Genetics|date=26 August 2010|volume=6|issue=8|pages=e1001076|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1001076|pmid=20865171|pmc=2928801}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two daughter cells can be regarded as “rejuvenated” copies of the parent cell because damaged macromolecules have been split between the two cells and diluted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rang|first=Camilla U.|author2=Peng, Annie Y. |author3=Chao, Lin |title=Temporal Dynamics of Bacterial Aging and Rejuvenation|journal=Current Biology|date=8 November 2011|volume=21|issue=21|pages=1813–1816|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2011.09.018|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982211010207|pmid=22036179}}&lt;/ref&gt; See [[asexual reproduction]].

==Cryptobiosis==
Some rare organisms, such as [[tardigrade]]s, usually have short lifespans, but are able to survive for thousands of years — and, perhaps, indefinitely — if they enter into the state of [[cryptobiosis]], whereby their [[metabolism]] is reversibly suspended. It is hypothesized by advocates of [[cryonics]] that the human [[central nervous system]] can be similarly put into a state of [[suspended animation]] shortly before [[brain death]] to be revived at a future point in the technological development of humankind when such operation would be possible.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

__TOC__

== Background: ''C. elegans'' ==
The roundworm ''C. elegans'' has one of the simplest nervous systems of any organism, with its [[hermaphrodite]] type having only 302 neurons. Furthermore, the structural [[connectome]] of these neurons is fully worked out. There are fewer than one thousand cells in the whole body of a ''C. elegans'' worm, and because ''C. Elegans'' is a [[model organism]], each has a unique identifier and comprehensive supporting literature. Being a model organism, the genome is fully known, along with many well characterized mutants readily available, a comprehensive literature of behavioural studies, etc. With so few neurons and new calcium 2 photon microscopy techniques it should soon be possible to record the complete neural activity of a living organism. By manipulating the neurons through optogenetic techniques, combined with the above recording capacities the project is in an unprecedented position to be able to fully characterize the neural dynamics of an entire organism.

In the process of trying to build an "in silico" model of a relatively simple organism like ''C. elegans'', new tools are being developed which will make it easier to model progressively more complex organisms.

===NemaLoad===

Project Nemaload &lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121007022842/http://nemaload.davidad.org/ NemaLoad]&lt;/ref&gt; was created as a research program trying to empirically establish the relevant biological facts which are necessary for a true bottom-up simulation. The project founder, [[David Dalrymple (computer scientist)|David Dalrymple]], is a collaborator on the OpenWorm project.

==OpenWorm project==

Although the ultimate goal is to simulate all features of ''C. elegans''' behaviour, the project is new and the first behaviour the Open Worm community decided to simulate is a simple motor response: teaching the worm to crawl. To do so, the virtual worm must be placed in a virtual environment. A full feedback loop must be established: Environmental Stimulus &gt; Sensory Transduction &gt; Interneuron Firing &gt; Motor Neuron Firing &gt; Motor Output &gt; Environmental Change &gt; Sensory Transduction.

There are two main technical challenges here: modelling the neural/electrical properties of the brain as it processes the information, and modelling the mechanical properties of the body as it moves. The neural properties are being modeled by a [[Hodgkin-Huxley model]], and the mechanical properties are being modeled by a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamic algorithm.

The OpenWorm team built an engine called Geppetto which could integrate these algorithms and due to its modularity will be able to model other biological systems (like [[digestion]]) which the team will tackle at a later time.

The team also built an environment called NeuroConstruct which is able to output neural structures in [[NeuroML]]. Using NeuroConstruct the team reconstructed the full connectome of ''C. elegans''.

Using NeuroML the team has also built a model of a muscle cell. Note that these models currently only model the relevant properties for the simple motor response: the neural/electrical and the mechanical properties discussed above.

The next step is to connect this muscle cell to the six neurons which synapse on it and approximate their effect.

The rough plan is to then both:
* Approximate the synapses which synapse on those neurons
* Repeat the process for other muscle cells

===Progress===
As of January 2015, the project is still awaiting peer review, and researchers involved in the project are reluctant to make bold claims about its current resemblance to biological behavior; project coordinator Stephen Larson estimates that they are "only 20 to 30 percent of the way towards where we need to get".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/01/21/tech/mci-lego-worm/ |title=Scientists upload a worm's mind into a Lego robot |work=CNN |last=Shadbolt |first=Peter |date=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 Japanese researchers announced the Perfect C. elegans Project. A proposal was submitted, but the project appears to have been abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kitano|first=Hiroaki|last2=Hamahashi|first2=Shugo|last3=Luke|first3=Sean|date=April 1998|title=The Perfect C.

In 2004 a group from Hiroshima began the Virtual C. elegans Project. They released two papers which showed how their simulation would retract from virtual prodding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.bsys.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/pub/pdf/J/J_152.pdf |title=A dynamic body model of the Nematode C. elegans with neural oscillators |journal=Journal of Robotics and Mechatronics |volume=17 |issue=3 |date=2005 |first1=Michiyo |last1=Suzuki |first2=Takeshi |last2=Goto |first3=Toshio |last3=Tsuji |first4=Hisao |last4=Ohtake |pages=318–326}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Suzuki|first=Michiyo|last2=Tsuji|first2=Toshio|last3=Ohtake|first3=Hisao|date=September 2005|title=A model of motor control of the nematode C. elegans with neuronal circuits|url=http://www.bsys.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/pub/pdf/J/J_153.pdf|journal=Artificial Intelligence in Medicine|volume=35|issue=1-2|pages=75–86|doi=10.1016/j.artmed.2005.01.008|issn=0933-3657}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 a Texas researcher described a simplified C. elegans simulator based on a 1-wire network incorporating a digital Parallax Basic Stamp processor, sensory inputs and motor outputs. Inputs employed 16-bit A/D converters attached to operational amplifier simulated neurons and a 1-wire temperature sensor. Motor outputs were controlled by 256-position digital potentiometers and 8-bit digital ports. Artificial muscle action was based on Nitinol actuators. It used a "sense-process-react" operating loop which recreated several instinctual behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first=Paul |last=Frenger |title=Simple C. elegans Nervous System Emulator |conference=Houston Conference for Biomedical Engineering Research |date=2005 |page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These early attempts of simulation have been criticized for not being biologically realistic. Although we have the complete structural connectome, we do not know the [[synaptic weight]]s at each of the known synapses. We do not even know whether the synapses are inhibitory or excitatory. To compensate for this the Hiroshima group used machine learning to find some weights of the synapses which would generate the desired behaviour. It is therefore no surprise that the model displayed the behaviour, and it may not represent true understanding of the system.

==Open science==
The Open Worm community is committed to the ideals of [[open science]]. Generally this means that the team will try to publish in open access journals and include all data gathered (to avoid the file drawer problem). Indeed, all the biological data the team has gathered is publicly available, and the five publications the group has made so far are available for free on their website. All the software that OpenWorm has produced is completely free and open source.

Open Worm is also trying a radically open model of scientific collaboration. The team consists of anyone who wishes to be a part of it. There are over one hundred "members" who are signed up for the high volume technical mailing list. Of the most active members who are named on a publication there are collaborators from Russia, Brazil, England, Scotland, Ireland and the United States. To coordinate this international effort, the team uses "virtual lab meetings" and other online tools that are detailed in the resources section.

The '''philosophy of happiness''' is the [[philosophical]] concern with the [[existence]], [[nature]], and attainment of [[happiness]]. Philosophers believe, happiness can be understood as the moral goal of life or as an aspect of chance; indeed, in most European languages the term happiness is synonymous with luck.&lt;ref&gt;Cassin et al. ''Dictionary of Untranslatables''. Princeton University Press, 2014. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, philosophers usually explicate on happiness as either a state of mind, or a life that goes well for the person leading it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/happiness/#MeaHap|title=Happiness|work=stanford.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient Greece==

===Plato===
{{rquote|right|''We have proved that justice in itself is the best thing for the soul itself, and that the soul ought to do justice...''|[[Plato]], ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]''&lt;ref name="Pl-10.612b"&gt;Plato, ''The Republic'' 10.612b&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Plato]] (c. 428{{snd}} c. 347 BCE), using [[Socrates]] (c. 470{{snd}} 399 BCE) as the main character in his [[Plato#The dialogues|philosophical dialogues]], outlined the requirements for happiness in ''The Republic''.

In ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', Plato asserts that those who are moral are the only ones who may be truly happy. Thus, one must understand the [[cardinal virtues]], particularly justice. Through the thought experiment of the [[Ring of Gyges]], Plato comes to the conclusion that one who abuses power enslaves himself to his appetites, while the man who chooses not to remains rationally in control of himself, and therefore is happy.&lt;ref name="Pl-10.612b"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/12487162/Plato_Happiness_and_Justice Joshua Olsen, ''Plato, Happiness and Justice'']&lt;/ref&gt;

He also sees a type of happiness stemming from [[social justice]] through fulfilling one's social function; since this duty forms happiness, other typically seen sources of happiness{{snd}} such as leisure, wealth, and pleasure{{snd}} are deemed lesser, if not completely false, forms of happiness.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/27743804 Richard D. Mohr, "A Platonic Happiness". ''History of Philosophy Quarterly,'' Vol. 4, No. 2 (Apr., 1987), pp. 131-145.University of Illinois.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aristotle===
[[Aristotle]] (384 – 322 BCE) held that ''[[eudaimonia]]'' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: [[:Wiktionary:εὐδαιμονία|εὐδαιμονία]]) is the goal of human thought and action. Eudaimonia is usually translated as [[happiness]], but "human flourishing" may be a more accurate translation.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel N. Robinson. (1999). Aristotle's Psychology. Published by Daniel N. Robinson. {{ISBN|0-9672066-0-X}} {{ISBN|978-0967206608}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eudaimonia involves activity, exhibiting virtue (''[[arete (moral virtue)|arete]]'', [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: [[wiktionary:ἀρετή|ἀρετή]]) in accordance with [[virtue]].

Within the ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'', Aristotle points to the fact that many aims are really only intermediate aims, and are desired only because they make the achievement of higher aims possible.&lt;ref&gt;Book I Chapter 1 [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0054%3Abekker+page%3D1094a 1094a].&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, things such as wealth, intelligence, and courage are valued only in relation to other things, while eudaimonia is the only thing valuable in isolation.

Aristotle regarded virtue as necessary for a person to be happy and held that without virtue the most that may be attained is contentment. Aristotle has been criticized for failing to show that virtue is necessary in the way he claims it to be, and he does not address this moral skepticism.&lt;ref&gt;Kraut, Richard, "Aristotle's Ethics", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2012 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2012/entries/aristotle-ethics/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cynicism===
{{Main|Cynicism (philosophy)}}
[[File:Greek philosopher busts.jpg|thumb|The carved busts of [[Socrates]], [[Antisthenes]], [[Chrysippus]], and [[Epicurus]].]]

[[Antisthenes]] (c. 445 – c. 365 BCE), often regarded as the founder of [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynicism]], advocated an ascetic life lived in accordance with [[virtue]]. Xenophon testifies that Antisthenes had praised the joy that sprang "from out of one's soul,"&lt;ref&gt;Xenophon, Symposium, iv. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Diogenes Laertius]] relates that Antisthenes was fond of saying: "I would rather go mad than feel pleasure."&lt;ref&gt;[[Diogenes Laërtius]], ''[[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers]]'', vi. 3&lt;/ref&gt; He maintained that virtue was sufficient in itself to ensure happiness, only needing the strength of a [[Socrates]].

He, along with all following Cynics, rejected any conventional notions of happiness involving money, [[power (sociology)|power]], and [[celebrity|fame]], to lead entirely virtuous, and thus happy, [[personal life|lives]].&lt;ref name="cynic1"&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/c/cynics.htm ''Cynics''] – ''The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, happiness can be gained through [[asceticism|rigorous training]] (askesis, [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: [[:Wiktionary:ἄσκησις|ἄσκησις]]) and by living in a way which was natural for [[humans]], rejecting all conventional desires, preferring a [[simple living|simple life]] free from all possessions.

[[Diogenes of Sinope]] (c. 412 – c. 323 BCE) is most frequently seen as the perfect embodiment of the philosophy. The [[stoicism|Stoics]] themselves saw him as one of the few, if not only, who have had achieved the state of [[sophos (philosophy)|sage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ancientworlds.net/aw/Article/497576|title=The Stoic Sage|work=ancientworlds.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stoicism===
{{Main|Stoicism}}
{{rquote|right|''If you work at that which is before you, following right reason seriously, vigorously, calmly, without allowing anything else to distract you, but keeping your divine part pure, as if you were bound to give it back immediately; if you hold to this, expecting nothing, but satisfied to live now according to nature, speaking heroic truth in every word that you utter, you will live happy. And there is no man able to prevent this.''|[[Marcus Aurelius]], ''[[Meditations]]''&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcus Aurelius]], ''[[Meditations]]''. iii.12&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Stoicism]] was a school of philosophy established by [[Zeno of Citium]] (c. 334 – c. 262 BCE). While Zeno was [[syncretism|syncretic]] in thought, his primary influence were the Cynics, with [[Crates of Thebes]] (c. 365 – c. 285 BCE) as his mentor.

Stoics believe that "virtue is sufficient for [[happiness]]".&lt;ref name="Stoicism"&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/stoicism/ Stoicism], Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.&lt;/ref&gt; One who has attained this sense of virtue would become a [[sage (philosophy)|sage]]. In the words of Epictetus, this sage would be "sick and yet happy, in peril and yet happy, dying and yet happy, in exile and happy, in disgrace and happy,"&lt;ref name="Russell"&gt;Russell, Bertrand. ''A History of Western Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt;

The Stoics therefore spent their time trying to attain virtue. This would only be achieved if one was to dedicate their life studying [[Stoic logic]], [[Stoic physics]], and [[Stoicism#Ethics and virtues|Stoic ethics]].

===Cyrenaics===
{{Main|Cyrenaics}}
{{rquote|right|''As a consequence the [[sage (philosophy)|sage]], even if he has his troubles, will nonetheless be happy, even if few pleasures accrue to him.''|[[Diogenes Laertius]] on [[Anniceris]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Diogenes Laërtius]], ''[[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers]]'', ii. 96-97&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes the Cynics: Sayings and Anecdotes with Other Popular Moralists, trans. Robin Hard. Oxford University Press, 2012. Page 152.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Cyrenaics]] were a school of philosophy established by [[Aristippus of Cyrene]] (c. 435 – c. 356 BCE). The school asserted that the only good is positive pleasure, and pain is the only evil. They posit that all feeling is momentary so all past and future pleasure have no real existence for an individual, and that among present pleasures there is no distinction of kind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Annas|1995|p=230}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Claudius Aelianus]], in his ''Historical Miscellany'',&lt;ref&gt;Aelian, Historical Miscellany 14.6&lt;/ref&gt; writes about Aristippus:

{{quote|"He recommended that one should concrete on the present day, and indeed on the very part of it in which one is acting and thinking. For only the present, he said, truly belongs to us, and not what has passed by or what we are anticipating: for the one is gone and done with, and it is uncertain whether the other will come to be"&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes the Cynics: Sayings and Anecdotes with Other Popular Moralists, trans. Robin Hard. Oxford University Press, 2012. Page 124.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some immediate pleasures can create more than their equivalent of pain. The wise person should be in control of pleasures rather than be enslaved to them, otherwise pain will result, and this requires judgement to evaluate the different pleasures of life.&lt;ref name="copleston122"&gt;{{Harvnb|Copleston|2003|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Epicureanism===
{{Main|Epicureanism}}
{{rquote|right|''Of all the means which wisdom acquires to ensure happiness throughout the whole of life, by far the most important is friendship.''|Epicurus&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epicurus.net/en/principal.html|title=Epicurus - Principal Doctrines|author=Vincent Cook|work=epicurus.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Epicureanism]] was founded by [[Epicurus]] (c. 341 – c. 270 BCE). The goal of his philosophy was to attain a state of [[ataraxia|tranquility]] (''ataraxia'', [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: [[:Wiktionary:ἀταραξία|ἀταραξία]]) and freedom from fear, as well as [[aponia|absence of bodily pain]] (''aponia'', [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: [[:Wiktionary: ἀπονία|ἀπονία]]). Toward these ends, Epicurus recommended an [[asceticism|ascetic lifestyle]], noble friendship, and the avoidance of politics.

One aid to achieving happiness is the ''[[tetrapharmakos]]'' or the four-fold cure:

===School of the Sextii===
{{Main|School of the Sextii}}

The School of the Sextii was founded by [[Quintus Sextius the Elder]] ([[fl.]] 50 BCE). It characterized itself mainly as a philosophical-medical school, blending [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]], [[Platonism|Platonic]], [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic]], and [[Stoicism|Stoic]] elements together.&lt;ref name='Paola'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ricercafilosofica.it/epekeina/index.php/epekeina/article/view/74|title=Philosophical thought of the School of the Sextii - Di Paola - EPEKEINA.

For St. Augustine, all human actions revolve around [[love]], and the primary problem humans face is the misplacing of love.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/ethics-everyone/201106/achieving-hapGenesis creation narrativepiness-advice-augustine&lt;/ref&gt; Only in [[God]] can one find happiness, as He is source of happiness.

J. O'Connell, "The Enneads and St. Augustine's Image of Happiness."

St. Augustine deals with the concept of happiness directly in his treatises ''De beata vita'' and ''Contra Academicos''.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

[[Boethius]] (c. 480–524 AD) was a [[philosopher]], most famous for writing ''[[The Consolation of Philosophy]]''. The work has been described as having had the single most important influence on the [[Christianity]] [[History of Christianity during the Middle Ages|of the Middle Ages and]] early [[The Renaissance|Renaissance]] and as the last great work of the [[Classical antiquity|Classical Period]].&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to ''The Consolation of Philosophy'', Oxford World's Classics, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dante Divine"&gt;[[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] identified Boethius as the "last of the Romans and first of the Scholastics" among the doctors in his Paradise (see ''[[The Divine Comedy]]'' and also below).&lt;/ref&gt; The book describes many themes, but among them he discusses how happiness can be attainable despite changing [[Luck|fortune]], while considering the nature of happiness and God.

He posits that happiness is acquired by attaining the perfect good, and that perfect good is God.&lt;ref name="catholic.com"/&gt; He then concludes that as God ruled the universe through Love, prayer to God and the application of Love would lead to true happiness.&lt;ref name="Beck"&gt;Sanderson Beck (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michel de Montaigne]] (1533-1592) was a [[French philosophy|French philosopher]].

===Jeremy Bentham===
{{Main|Utilitarianism}}
[[Jeremy Bentham]] (1748-1832) was a British [[philosopher]], [[jurist]], and [[social reformer]]. He is regarded as the founder of modern [[utilitarianism]].

His particular brand of utilitarianism indicated that the most moral action is that which causes the highest amount of utility, where defined utility as the aggregate pleasure after deducting suffering of all involved in any action. Happiness, therefore, is the experience of pleasure and the lack of pain.&lt;ref name="utm.edu2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/bentham/|title=Bentham, Jeremy - Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|work=utm.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actions which do not promote the greatest happiness is morally wrong - such as ascetic sacrifice.&lt;ref name="utm.edu2"/&gt; This manner of thinking permits the possibility of [[Felicific calculus|a calculator to measure happiness and moral value]].

===Arthur Schopenhauer===
[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] (1788-1860) was a [[Germans|German]] [[philosopher]]. His philosophy express that egotistical acts are those that are guided by self-interest, desire for pleasure or happiness, where as only [[compassion]] can be a moral act.

Schopenhauer explains happiness in terms of a wish that is satisfied, which in turn gives rise to a new wish. And the absence of satisfaction is suffering, which results in an empty longing. He also links happiness with the movement of time, as we feel happy when times moves faster and feel sad when time slows down.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer, The World as Will and Idea. Cologne 1997, Volume One, §52th.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Herbert Marcuse===
[[Herbert Marcuse]] (1898–1979) was a German-American [[philosophy|philosopher]], [[sociology|sociologist]], and [[political philosophy|political theorist]], associated with the [[Frankfurt School]] of [[critical theory]].

In his 1937 essay 'The Affirmative Character of Culture,' he suggests culture develops tension within the structure of society, and in that tension can challenge the current social order. If it separates itself from the everyday world, the demand for happiness will cease to be external, and begin to become an object of spiritual contemplation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/marcuse/|title=Herbert Marcuse|work=stanford.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[One-Dimensional Man]]'', his criticism of consumerism suggests that the current system is one that claims to be [[democracy|democratic]], but is [[authoritarian]] in character, as only a few individuals dictate the perceptions of freedom by only allowing certain choices of happiness to be available for purchase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Marcuse | first1 = Herbert | title = One-dimensional Man: studies in ideology of advanced industrial society | chapter = Introduction to the Second Edition | publisher = Routledge | year = 1991 | location = London | pages = 3 | isbn = 978-0-415-07429-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He further suggests that the conception that 'happiness can be bought' is one that is psychologically damaging.

[[Happiness economics]] is the quantitative and  theoretical study of [[happiness]], positive and negative [[Affect (psychology)|affect]], [[well-being]], [[quality of life]], [[life satisfaction]] and related concepts, typically combining [[economics]] with other fields such as [[psychology]] and [[sociology]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14878">"'''Precambrian rabbits'''" or "'''fossil rabbits in the Precambrian'''" are reported to have been among responses given by the biologist [[J.B.S. Haldane]] when asked what [[evidence]] could destroy his confidence in the [[theory of evolution]] and the field of study. The answers became popular [[image]]ry in debates about evolution and the scientific field of [[evolutionary biology]] in the 1990s. Many of Haldane's statements about his scientific research were popularized in his lifetime.

Some accounts use this response to rebut claims that the [[theory]] of evolution is [[Objections to evolution#Evolution is unfalsifiable|not falsifiable]] by any [[empirical evidence]]. This followed an assertion by philosopher, [[Karl Popper]], who had proposed that [[Falsifiability|''falsifiability'']] is an essential feature of a scientific theory. Popper also expressed doubts about the scientific status of evolutionary theory, although he later concluded that the field of study was genuinely scientific.

[[Rabbits]] are [[mammal]]s. From the perspective of the [[philosophy of science]], it is doubtful whether the genuine discovery of mammalian [[fossil]]s in [[Precambrian]] rocks would overthrow the theory of evolution instantly, though if authentic, such a discovery would indicate serious errors in modern understanding about the evolutionary process. Mammals are a class of animals whose emergence in the [[geologic timescale]] is dated to much later than any found in Precambrian strata. Geological records indicate that although the first true mammals appeared in the [[Triassic]] period, modern mammalian orders appeared in the [[Palaeocene]] and [[Eocene]] epochs of the [[Palaeogene]] period. Hundreds of millions of years separate this period from the Precambrian.

==Origin of the phrase==

Several authors have written that J.B.S. Haldane (1892–1964) said that the discovery of a [[fossil]] [[rabbit]] in Precambrian rocks would be enough to destroy his belief in [[evolution]].&lt;ref name="Ridley2004Evolution"&gt;{{cite book

==Theoretical background==
The philosopher [[Karl Popper]] held that any scientific proposition must be falsifiable, in other words it must at least be possible to [[thought experiment|imagine some reproducible experiment or observation]] whose outcome would disprove the hypothesis.&lt;ref name="Hull1999UseAndAbuseOfPopper" /&gt; Initially he thought that [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[natural selection]] (often summarized as "the survival of the fittest"&lt;ref name=OriginCh4&gt;"This preservation of favourable individual differences and variations, and the destruction of those which are injurious, I have called Natural Selection, or the Survival of the Fittest." &amp;mdash; {{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although in 1978 Popper wrote that his earlier objection had been specifically to the theory of natural selection, in lectures and articles from 1949 to 1974 he had stated that "[[Darwinism]]" or "Darwin's theory of evolution" was a "metaphysical research programme" because it was not falsifiable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact he continued to express dissatisfaction with contemporary statements of the theory of evolution which focused on [[population genetic]]s, the study of the relative frequencies of [[allele]]s (different forms of the same [[gene]]). Unfortunately some of the adjustments he proposed resembled [[Lamarckianism]] or [[saltation (biology)|saltationism]], evolutionary theories that were and still are considered obsolete, and evolutionary biologists therefore disregarded his criticisms.&lt;ref name="Hull1999UseAndAbuseOfPopper"&gt;{{cite journal

| pages=481 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981 Popper complained that he had been misinterpreted as saying that "historical sciences" such as [[paleontology]] or the [[evolutionary history of life|history of evolution of life on Earth]] were not genuine sciences, when in fact he believed they could make falsifiable predictions.&lt;ref name="Hull1999UseAndAbuseOfPopper" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Further confusion arose in 1980–1981, when there was a long debate in the pages of ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' about the scientific status of the theory of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Editorial |title= How true is the theory of evolution? |url= |journal= Nature |volume= 290|issue= 5802 | pages= 75–76 |year= 1981 |pmid=7207599|doi= 10.1038/290075a0|bibcode= 1981Natur.290...75.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=johnson&gt;{{cite book| author= Johnson PE|title= Darwin on Trial|year= 2010 | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=YtrGVVwk5HsC&amp;dq |page= 238 | publisher=  InterVarsity Press |isbn= 9780830838318 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the argument was on the factors influencing and nature of the [[unit of selection]] in the genome, with one side positing natural selection,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Orgel LE, Crick FH |title= Selfish DNA: the ultimate parasite |url= |journal= Nature |volume= 284|issue= 5757 | pages=604–607  |year=1980  |pmid=7366731 |doi= 10.1038/284604a0|bibcode=1980Natur.284..604O}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Cavalier-Smith T |title= How selfish is DNA? |url= |journal= Nature |volume= 285|issue= 5767 | pages=617–618  |year=1980  |pmid= 7393317 |doi= 10.1038/285617a0|bibcode= 1980Natur.285..617C}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the other, [[Neutral mutation theory|neutral mutation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dover G, Doolittle WF |title= Modes of genome evolution |url= |journal= Nature |volume=288|issue= 5792 | pages= 646–647 |year=1980 |pmid= 6256636|doi= 10.1038/288646a0|bibcode=1980Natur.288..646D}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Li WH, Gojobori T, Nei M |title= Pseudogenes as a paradigm of neutral evolution |url= |journal= Nature |volume=292|issue= 5820 | pages= 237–239 |year=1981 |pmid= 7254315|doi= 10.1038/292237a0|bibcode=1981Natur.292..237L}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither of the parties seriously doubted that the theory was both scientific and, according to current scientific knowledge, true. Some participants objected to statements that appeared to present the theory of evolution as an absolute dogma, however, rather than as a hypothesis that so far has performed very well, and both sides quoted Popper in support of their positions. Evolution critics such as [[Phillip E. Johnson]] took this as an opportunity to declare that the theory of evolution was unscientific.&lt;ref name="Hull1999UseAndAbuseOfPopper" /&gt;&lt;ref name=johnson/&gt;

==Would anachronistic fossils disprove evolution?==
Evolutionary biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] said that the discovery of [[fossil mammal]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s in Precambrian rocks would "completely blow evolution out of the water."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news 
| title=The Evolution Wars | author=Wallis, C. | newspaper=Time | date= August 7, 2005

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher [[Peter Godfrey-Smith]] doubted that a single set of [[anachronistic]] fossils, however, even rabbits in the Precambrian, would disprove the theory of evolution outright. The first question raised by the assertion of such a discovery would be whether the alleged "Precambrian rabbits" really were fossilized rabbits. Alternative interpretations might include incorrect identification of the "fossils", incorrect dating of the rocks, and a [[hoax]] such as the [[Piltdown Man]] was shown to be. Even if the "Precambrian rabbits" turned out to be genuine, they would not instantly refute the theory of evolution, because that theory is a large package of ideas, including: that life on Earth has evolved over billions of years; that this evolution is driven by certain mechanisms; and that these mechanisms have produced a specific "family tree" that defines the relationships among species and the order in which they appeared. Hence, "Precambrian rabbits" would prove that there were one or more serious errors somewhere in this package, and the next task would be to identify those errors.&lt;ref name="GodfreySmith2003TheoryAndReality" /&gt;

Benton pointed out that, in the short term, scientists often have to accept the existence of competing hypotheses, each of which explains large parts&amp;mdash;but not all&amp;mdash;of the observed relevant data.&lt;ref name="BentonHitchin1996QualityOfFossilRecord" /&gt;

==Oldest rabbit==

Genuine fossils of earliest rabbits are from the [[Eocene]] [[epoch (geology)|Epoch]], about 56 to 33.9 million years ago. Members of the [[genus]] ''[[Gomphos]]'' are established to be the [[phylogenetic]] root of [[lagomorph]] rabbits and hares.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Asher RJ, Meng J, Wible JR, McKenna MC, Rougier GW, Dashzeveg D, Novacek MJ |url= |title=Stem Lagomorpha and the antiquity of ''Glires'' | journal=Science |volume= 307|issue=5712 |pages= 1091–1094| year= 2005|pmid=15718468 |doi=10.1126/science.1107808|bibcode=2005Sci...307.1091A}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, the oldest ''Gomphos'' is ''G. elkema'' discovered in 2008 from [[Gujarat]], [[India]].

'''''Shòu''''' ({{zh|s=寿|t=壽|p={{audio|Zh-shòu.ogg|shòu|help=no}}}}) is the Chinese word/character for "longevity".

== Use ==
Three of the most important goals in life in Chinese traditional thought are the propitious blessings of happiness (''fú'' 福), professional success or prosperity (''lù'' 禄), and longevity (''shòu'' 寿). These are visually represented by the three "star gods" of the same names ([[Fu Lu Shou|''Fú, Lù, Shòu'']]), commonly depicted as three male figurines&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Duda |first=Margaret |title=Traditional Chinese  Toggles |publisher=EDM |year=2011 |page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; (each wearing a distinctive garment and holding an object that enables them to be differentiated), or the Chinese ideographs/characters themselves, or various homophones or objects with relevant attributes. ''Shòu'' is instantly recognizable. "He holds in his hand a large peach, and attached to his long staff are a gourd and a scroll. The stag and the bat both indicate ''fu'' happiness. The peach, gourd, and scroll are symbols of longevity."&lt;ref name=werner431&gt;{{cite book |last=Werner |first=E. T. C. |title=A Dictionary of Chinese Mythology |publisher=Kelly and Walsh |year=1932 |page=431}}&lt;/ref&gt; His most striking characteristic is, however, his large and high forehead, which earned him the title "Longevity Star Old-pate".&lt;ref name=werner431 /&gt;

The Chinese character ''shòu'' (寿) is usually found on textiles, furniture, ceramics and jewelry, generally in its more complex ideograph (壽), but also in its simplified (post-1950) form (寿). The ideograph may appear alone or be surrounded by flowers, bats, or other good luck symbols, but will always hold a central position. 

Longevity is commonly recognized as one of the Five Blessings (''wǔfú'' 五福 - longevity, wealth, health, love of virtue, a peaceful death) of Chinese belief&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bartholomew |first=Terese Tse |title=Hidden Meanings in Chinese Art |publisher=Asian Art Museum of San Francisco |page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; that are often depicted in the [[homophone|homophonous]] rendition of five flying [[bat]]s because the word for "[[bat]]" in Chinese (''fú'' 蝠) sounds like the word for [[Fu character|"good fortune" or "happiness"]] or in this case, "blessings".&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomew, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; In this arrangement, the ''shòu'' ideograph sometimes takes the dominant central position, replacing the fifth bat.

Other symbols in Chinese iconography that represent longevity include [[Pine|pine trees]], [[Crane (bird)|cranes]], spotted deer, special collectors' stones (''shòushí'' 寿石), [[peach]]es, and [[tortoise]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Duda, pp. 204-6&lt;/ref&gt; These are often depicted in small groupings to emphasize the central, symbolic meaning of the picture (for example, cranes standing amongst pine trees).  

Perhaps the most common Chinese auspicious saying concerning longevity is that found on scrolls in nearly every Chinese calligraphy shop in the world: ''shòu shān fú hǎi'' (寿山福海), which can be translated as "May your life be as steadfast as the mountains and your good fortune as limitless as the seas".

Since 2017, the version 10 of the [[Unicode]] Standard features a rounded version of the symbol in the "Enclosed Ideographic Supplement" block, at code point U+1F262 (ROUNDED SYMBOL FOR SHOU).&lt;ref name="unicode"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Unicode Standard, Version 10.0, Enclosed Ideographic Supplement|url=https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/Unicode-10.0/U100-1F200.pdf|website=unicode.org|publisher=The Unicode Consortium|accessdate=16 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In names===
As a sign for a resonant cultural concept, the character became a part of many Chinese names (e.g. [[Palace of Tranquil Longevity]] in Beijing). The Japanese equivalent is '''Kotobuki''' 寿 (see [[Nakajima Kotobuki]], [[Tsukasa Kotobuki]]). See also [[Jurōjin]] (Shou Laoren) and [[Fukurokuju]].

'''Sugarscape''' is a model for [[Artificial intelligence|artificially intelligent]] [[Agent-based model|agent-based]] [[social simulation]] following some or all rules presented by [[Joshua M. Epstein]] &amp; [[Robert Axtell]] in their book ''Growing Artificial Societies''.&lt;ref name="GAS"&gt;{{cite book

|publisher=Brookings Institution Press
|date=October 11, 1996
|pages=224
|isbn=978-0-262-55025-3
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
Fundaments of Sugarscape models can be traced back to the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] where economist [[Thomas Schelling]] presented his paper titled ''[[Thomas Schelling#Models of segregation|Models of Segregation]]''.&lt;ref name="Sourceforge1"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://sugarscape.sourceforge.net/ |title=Sugarscape - Growing Agent-based Artificial Societies |publisher=[[Sourceforge]] |accessdate=7 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Written in 1969, Schelling and the rest of the [[social environment]] modelling fraternity had their options limited by a lack of adequate computing power and an applicable programming mechanism to fully develop the potential of their model.

[[John Horton Conway|John Conway]]'s agent-based simulation "[[Conway's Game of Life|Game of Life]]" was enhanced and applied to Schelling's original idea by [[Joshua M. Epstein]] and [[Robert Axtell]] in their book ''Growing Artificial Societies''. To demonstrate their findings on the field of agent-based simulation, a model was created and distributed with their book on CD-ROM. The concept of this model has come to be known as "the Sugarscape model".&lt;ref name="GAS" /&gt; Since then, the name "Sugarscape" has been used for agent-based models using rules similar to those defined by Epstein &amp; Axtell.

==Principles==
All Sugarscape models include the [[Intelligent agent|agents]] (inhabitants), the environment (a two-dimensional grid) and the rules governing the interaction of the agents with each other and the environment.

The original model presented by J. Epstein &amp; R. Axtell (considered as the [[Social simulation#History and development|first large scale agent model]]) is based on a 51x51 cell grid, where every cell can contain different amounts of sugar (or spice). In every step agents look around, find the closest cell filled with sugar, move and metabolize. They can leave pollution, die, reproduce, inherit sources, transfer information, trade or borrow sugar, generate immunity or transmit diseases - depending on the specific scenario and variables defined at the set-up of the model.

Sugar in simulation could be seen as a metaphor for resources in an artificial world through which the examiner can study the effects of social dynamics such as evolution, marital status and inheritance on populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

|issn=1535-0096
}}(Retrieved from [[ProQuest|ABI/Inform]] Document ID: 347271391)&lt;/ref&gt;

Exact simulation of the original rules provided by J. Epstein &amp; R. Axtell in their book can be problematic&lt;ref name="tricky"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/interdisciplinary-science/research/replicating-sugarscape
|title=Replicating Sugarscape — University of Leicester
|accessdate=18 January 2011
}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is not always possible to recreate the same results as those presented in ''Growing Artificial Societies''.

==Model implementations==
The Sugarscape model has had several implementations, some of which are available as [[Open-source software|open source]] software.

===Ascape===
An original implementation was developed in [[Ascape]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]] software suitable for [[agent-based social simulation]]. The Sugarscape model remains part of the built-in library of models distributed with Ascape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://ascape.sourceforge.net/manual/Section1.html
|title=The Ascape Model Developer’s Manual
|publisher=[[Sourceforge]]
|accessdate=9 November 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NetLogo===
[[NetLogo]] has been used to build Sugarscape models. Three Sugarscape scenarios are included in the NetLogo Models Library: "Immediate Growback", "Constant Growback" and "Wealth Distribution". Besides these three scenarios lies Iain Weaver's Sugarscape NetLogo model, which is part of the User Community Models Library. "It builds on Owen Densmore's NetLogo community model to encompass all rules discussed in ''Growing Artificial Societies'' with the exception of the combat rule (although trivial to include, it adds little value to the model)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/community/Sugarscape
|title=NetLogo User Community Models: Sugarscape
|accessdate=9 November 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model is equipped with rich documentation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/interdisciplinary-science/research/the-sugarscape
|title=The Sugarscape 
|publisher=[[University of Leicester]]
|accessdate=19 January 2011
}}&lt;/ref&gt; including instructions for successful replication of the original Sugarscape rules.&lt;ref name="tricky"/&gt;

===SugarScape on steroids===

Due to the emergent nature of [[agent-based model]]s (ABMs), it is critical that the population sizes in the simulations match the population sizes of the dynamic systems being modelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|last1=Gilbert
|first1=Nigel
|last2=Bankes
|first2=Steven
|year=2002

|volume=99
|issue=3
|pages=7197–7198
|doi=10.1073/pnas.072079499 |pmc=128584
}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the performance of contemporary agent simulation frameworks has been inadequate to handle such large population sizes and parallel computing frameworks designed to run on [[computing cluster]]s has been limited by available bandwidth. As computing power increases with [[Moore's law]], the size and complexity of simulation frameworks can be expected to increase. The team of R. M. D’Souza, M. Lysenko and K Rahmani from [[Michigan Technological University]] used a Sugarscape model to demonstrate the power of [[Graphics processing unit]]s (GPU) in ABM simulations with over 50 updates per second with agent populations exceeding 2 millions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

'''Tierra''' is a [[computer simulation]] developed by [[ecologist]] [[Thomas S. Ray]] in the early 1990s in which [[computer program]]s compete for time (central processing unit ([[Central processing unit|CPU]]) time) and space (access to [[main memory]]). In this context, the computer programs in Tierra are considered to be [[evolvability|evolvable]] and can [[mutation|mutate]], [[self-replication|self-replicate]] and [[Genetic recombination|recombine]]. Tierra's virtual machine is written in [[C (programming language)|C]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ray|first=Thomas|title=What this Program is|url=http://life.ou.edu/pubs/doc/index.html#What|accessdate=3 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It operates on a custom instruction set designed to facilitate code changes and reordering, including features such as jump to template&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ray|first=Thomas|title=Available instructions|url=http://life.ou.edu/pubs/doc/index.html#Idt|accessdate=3 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (as opposed to the relative or absolute jumps common to most instruction sets).

== Simulations ==
The basic Tierra model has been used to experimentally explore ''[[in silico]]'' the basic processes of [[evolution]]ary and [[ecology|ecological]] dynamics. Processes such as the dynamics of [[punctuated equilibrium]], [[Host (biology)|host]]-[[parasite]] [[co-evolution]] and density-dependent [[natural selection]] are amenable to investigation within the Tierra framework. A notable difference between Tierra and more conventional models of [[evolutionary computation]], such as [[genetic algorithm]]s, is that there is no explicit, or [[exogenous]] [[fitness (biology)|fitness function]] built into the model. Often in such models there is the notion of a function being "optimized"; in the case of Tierra, the fitness function is endogenous: there is simply survival and death.

According to Thomas S. Ray and others, this may allow for more "open-ended" evolution, in which the dynamics of the feedback between evolutionary and ecological processes can itself change over time (see [[evolvability]]), although this claim has not been realized – like other digital evolution systems, it eventually reaches a point where novelty ceases to be created, and the system at large begins either looping or ceases to 'evolve'. The issue of how true [[open-ended evolution]] can be implemented in an artificial system is still an open question in the field of [[artificial life]].&lt;ref&gt;Bedau M.A., McCaskill J.S. et al., "Open problems in artificial life", ''Artificial Life'', 2000 Fall '''6'''(4):363-76&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mark Bedau]] and [[Norman Packard]] developed a statistical method of classifying evolutionary systems and in 1997, Bedau ''et al.'' applied these statistics to Evita, an [[Artificial life]] model similar to Tierra and [[Avida]], but with limited organism interaction and no parasitism, and concluded that Tierra-like systems do not exhibit the open-ended evolutionary signatures of naturally evolving systems.&lt;ref&gt;Bedau, M.A., Snyder, E., Brown, C.T. and Packard, N.H. 1997, "A Comparison of Evolutionary Activity in Artificial Evolving Systems and in the Biosphere", in ''Fourth European Conference on Artificial Life'', Husbands and Harvey (eds), MIT press, p125&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Russell K. Standish]] has measured the informational complexity of Tierran 'organisms', and has similarly not observed complexity growth in Tierran evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Standish, R.K. 2003 "Open-ended artificial evolution", ''International Journal of Computational Intelligence and Applications 3(2)'', 167-175&lt;/ref&gt;

Tierra is an abstract model, but any quantitative model is still subject to the same validation and verification techniques applied to more traditional [[mathematical model]]s, and as such, has no special status. The creation of more detailed models in which more realistic dynamics of biological systems and organisms are incorporated is now an active research field (see [[systems biology]]).

'''Torstein Aagaard-Nilsen''' (b. [[Oslo]], 11 January 1964) is a contemporary [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[composer]].

== Life ==
Aagaard-Nilsen grew up in [[Kabelvåg]] on [[Lofoten]] in northern Norway. From 1986 to 1990 he studied at the [[Grieg Academy|Bergen Conservatory of Music]] (now known as the Grieg Academy) and at the [[University of Bergen]].&lt;ref&gt;[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=q64561/biography|pure_url=yes}} Biography], [[Allmusic]]&lt;/ref&gt; From 1990 to 1994 he worked at the Bergen Conservatory as a teacher of [[contemporary classical music]]. Furthermore, he was leader of the ''Autunnale-festivalen - (Music Factory and Autunnale)'', also in Bergen. In 1992 and 1993 he arranged and composed for the ''Forsvarets Stabsmusikkorps Vestlandet - Norwegian Army Band, Bergen (NABB)'', writing, among other works, ''Arctic Landscape''. In this period Aagaard-Nilsen wrote many works for [[wind band]] and [[brass band]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.torsteinaagaardnilsen.no/index.php/cv |title= Bio from Aagard-Nilsen’s own website  |website= torsteinaagaardnilsen.no |date= |accessdate=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aagaard-Nilsen works as [[Conducting|conductor]] of various school and amateur orchestras, and also as a teacher at the ''Manger Folkehøgskule''. He founded the forum ''Av garde'' together with [[Ketil Hvoslef]], Jostein Stalheim and Knut Vaage.

As a composer he has written for [[orchestra]], chamber ensemble, [[choir]], wind band and brass band. Works that exemplify Aagard-Nilsen fosuc on narrative and visual aspects in a nearly impulsive form include ''Fabula I ''and ''Fabula II'' (1996), ''Sinfonietta'' (1998) and ''The Season of Blue Lights'' (2008) commissioned by [[BIT20 Ensemble]]. A stronger focus on expressive elements in Aagard-Nilsen’s output is evident in works such as ''Pierrot´s Lament'' (Concerto for Euphonium and Orchestra), premiered in 2001 with the [[Lahti Symphony Orchestra]]. The trumpet concerto ''Blue Phrases'' (2007), the sinfonietta ''The Season of Blue Light'' and quartet ''Blue Fragments'' (2008) are additional examples of Aagard-Nilsen’s expressive focus; while the orchestral work ''Boreas Sings'' (2012) represents a new direction in which a spectrum of colours and dancing rhythms become evident. 2014 saw his orchestral work ''Boreas Blæs'' (2014) premiered by the [[Norwegian Arctic Philharmonic Orchestra]] at the opening ceremony of Stormen, [[Bodø]]’s concert hall. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.listento.no/symfoni/kontakt.nsf/pub_e/per2000062811055384476081/ |title= Bio from MIC Music Information Centre Norway |website= listento.no |date= |accessdate=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

March 2016 saw Aagard-Nilsen being bestowed with the Norwegian Music Publishing Association’s Annual Award for his work ''Dirty Dancing'', commissioned and premiered by the Christiania Blåseensemble in 2015. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ballade.no/sak/disse-vant-musikkforleggerprisen/ |title= Ballade.no on the 2016 Norwegian Music Publishing Association’s Annual Award  |website= ballade.no |date= |accessdate=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Whangdoodle''' is a [[legendary creature|fanciful creature]] in [[folklore]] and [[children's literature]], most notably used by British authors [[Roald Dahl]] and [[Julie Andrews]]. Popularized by a sermon parody attributed to William P. Brannan as "Where the lion roareth and the whangdoodle mourneth for her first-born," published in ''The Harp of a Thousand Strings: Or, Laughter for a Lifetime'' (1858).
Whangdoodle is also an earlier term for a "fanciful formation" or a "gadget . . . thing for which the correct name is not known."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harper|first=Douglas|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=whangdoodle&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|accessdate=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roald Dahl books==

=== ''The Minpins'' ===
In [[Roald Dahl]]'s book ''[[The Minpins]]'', one of the main characters is warned by his mother against a forest where Whangdoodles live.

=== ''James and the Giant Peach'' ===
One of the firemen of the [[James and the Giant Peach|book]] refers to the [[centipede]] as a Whangdoodle.

=== ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'' ===
In ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'', [[Willy Wonka]] mentions that he saved the Oompa Loompas from Whangdoodles and various other monsters.

==The Last of the Really Great Whangdoodles==
{{main article|The Last of the Really Great Whangdoodles}}
A different Whangdoodle is described in the children's novel ''The Last of the Really Great Whangdoodles'' by singer and actress Dame [[Julie Andrews]] (under her married name of Julie Edwards): an intelligent, ungulate-like character capable of changing color to suit its emotions, from whose hind legs grow a new and different set of bedroom slippers each year. It is introduced to the [[protagonist]]s Ben, Tom, and Lindy, and thus to the reader, by the geneticist 'Professor Savant', a scholar of the Whangdoodle and its secret domain. Attempting to visit both, the scientist and children are opposed by the [[antagonist]] 'Prock' (the Whangdoodle's second-in-command), until his resources are exhausted by their tenacity. With Prock persuaded to grant their passage, the children discover that the Whangdoodle is oppressed by want of a mate, and convince Savant to create the latter. With this done, the two Whangdoodles are wedded at a great celebration, and the children return to their home.

== The Big Rock Candy Mountain ==
Some versions of the song "[[Big Rock Candy Mountain|The Big Rock Candy Mountain]]" include a mention of a Whangdoodle singing in the titular [[hobo]]'s paradise. This is the case in the version written down and arranged by Charles and Ruth Seeger. This version is used in the Frederic Rzewski composition for violin, piano, and percussion, entitled 'Whangdoodles'.
