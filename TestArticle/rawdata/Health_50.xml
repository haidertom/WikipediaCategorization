'''Antinutrients''' are natural or synthetic compounds that interfere with the absorption of [[nutrient]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XpUjsqD7lFUC&amp;pg=PA47|title=Oxford dictionary of biochemistry and molecular biology|last=|first=|date=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Cammack, Richard|year=|isbn=9780198529170|edition=Rev.|location=Oxford|pages=47|chapter=Aa|doi=10.1093/acref/9780198529170.001.0001|oclc=65467611|chapter-url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780198529170.001.0001/acref-9780198529170-e-1324?rskey=PPEnbe&amp;result=1261}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nutrition studies focus on these antinutrients commonly found in food sources and beverages.

== Examples ==
[[Phytic acid]] has a strong binding affinity to [[Mineral (nutrient)|minerals]] such as [[calcium]], [[magnesium]], [[iron]], [[copper]], and [[zinc]]. This results in precipitation, making the minerals unavailable for absorption in the [[Gastrointestinal tract|intestines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1 = Päivi | last1 = Ekholm | first2 = Liisa | last2 = Virkki | first3 = Maija | last3 = Ylinen | first4 = Liisa | last4 = Johansson | name-list-format = vanc |title=The effect of phytic acid and some natural chelating agents on the solubility of mineral elements in oat bran |journal=Food Chemistry |date=Feb 2003 |volume=80 |issue=2 |pages=165–70 |doi=10.1016/S0308-8146(02)00249-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cheryan M | title = Phytic acid interactions in food systems | journal = Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition | volume = 13 | issue = 4 | pages = 297–335 | year = 1980 | pmid = 7002470 | doi = 10.1080/10408398009527293 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Phytic acids are common in the hulls of nuts, seeds and grains and of great importance in [[agriculture]] animal nutrition and [[eutrophication]] wise due to the mineral [[chelation]] and bound [[phosphate]]s released in to the environment. Without the need to use phytate (but also nutrient) reducing [[Mill (grinding)|milling]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bohn L, Meyer AS, Rasmussen SK | title = Phytate: impact on environment and human nutrition. A challenge for molecular breeding | journal = Journal of Zhejiang University. Science. B | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 165–91 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 18357620 | pmc = 2266880 | doi = 10.1631/jzus.B0710640 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the amount of phytic acid is commonly reduced in [[animal feed]]s by adding [[Phytase#Histidine acid phosphatases (HAPs)|histidine acid phosphate]] type of [[phytase]]s to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kumar V, Singh G, Verma AK, Agrawal S | title = In silico characterization of histidine Acid phytase sequences | journal = Enzyme Research | volume = 2012 | pages = 845465 | date = 2012 | pmid = 23304454 | pmc = 3523131 | doi = 10.1155/2012/845465 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Protease]] [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibitors]] are substances that inhibit the actions of [[trypsin]], [[pepsin]] and other proteases in the gut, preventing the digestion and subsequent absorption of protein. For example, [[Bowman–Birk protease inhibitor|Bowman–Birk trypsin inhibitor]] is found in soybeans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1 = Anna L. | last1 = Tan-Wilson | first2 = Jean C. | last2 = Chen | first3 = Michele C. | last3 = Duggan | first4 = Cathy | last4 = Chapman | first5 = R. Scott | last5 = Obach | first6 = Karl A. | last6 = Wilson | name-list-format = vanc |title=Soybean Bowman-Birk trypsin isoinhibitors: classification and report of a glycine-rich trypsin inhibitor class |journal=J. Agric. Food Chem. |year=1987 |volume=35 |issue=6 |page=974 |doi=10.1021/jf00078a028}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lipase]] inhibitors interfere with enzymes, such as [[human pancreatic lipase]], that catalyze the hydrolysis of some [[lipid]]s, including fats. For example, the anti-obesity drug [[orlistat]] causes a percentage of fat to pass through the digestive tract undigested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Heck AM, Yanovski JA, Calis KA | title = Orlistat, a new lipase inhibitor for the management of obesity | journal = Pharmacotherapy | volume = 20 | issue = 3 | pages = 270–9 | date = March 2000 | pmid = 10730683 | doi = 10.1592/phco.20.4.270.34882 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Amylase]] inhibitors prevent the action of enzymes that break the [[glycosidic bond]]s of [[starch]]es and other complex [[carbohydrate]]s, preventing the release of simple sugars and absorption by the body. [[Amylase]] inhibitors, like lipase inhibitors, have been used as a diet aid and obesity treatment. Amylase inhibitors are present in many types of beans; commercially available amylase inhibitors are extracted from white [[kidney bean]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Preuss HG | title = Bean amylase inhibitor and other carbohydrate absorption blockers: effects on diabesity and general health | journal = Journal of the American College of Nutrition | volume = 28 | issue = 3 | pages = 266–76 | date = June 2009 | pmid = 20150600 | doi = 10.1080/07315724.2009.10719781 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Oxalic acid]] and [[oxalate]]s are present in many plants and in significant amounts particularly in [[rhubarb]], [[tea]], [[spinach]], [[parsley]] and [[Portulaca oleracea|purslane]]. Oxalates bind to [[calcium]] and prevent its absorption in the human body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dolan LC, Matulka RA, Burdock GA | title = Naturally occurring food toxins | journal = Toxins | volume = 2 | issue = 9 | pages = 2289–332 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 22069686 | pmc = 3153292 | doi = 10.3390/toxins2092289 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Glucosinolate]]s prevent the uptake of [[iodine]], affecting the function of the [[thyroid]] and thus are considered [[goitrogen]]s. They are found in plants such as [[broccoli]], [[Brussels sprout|brussel sprouts]], [[cabbage]], [[Brassica juncea|mustard greens]], [[radish]]es and [[cauliflower]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dolan LC, Matulka RA, Burdock GA | title = Naturally occurring food toxins | journal = Toxins | volume = 2 | issue = 9 | pages = 2289–332 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 22069686 | pmc = 3153292 | doi = 10.3390/toxins2092289 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Excessive intake of required nutrients can also result in them having an anti-nutrient action. Excessive intake of [[dietary fiber]] can reduce the transit time through the intestines to such a degree that other nutrients cannot be absorbed. However, this effect is often not seen in practice and reduction of absorbed minerals can be attributed mainly to the phytic acids in fibrous food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/other-nutrients/fiber|title=Fiber|last=|first=|date=2014-04-28|work=Linus Pauling Institute|access-date=2018-04-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180414180232/http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/other-nutrients/fiber|archive-date=2018-04-13|dead-url=no|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Coudray C, Demigné C, Rayssiguier Y | title = Effects of dietary fibers on magnesium absorption in animals and humans | journal = The Journal of Nutrition | volume = 133 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–4 | date = January 2003 | pmid = 12514257 | doi = 10.1093/jn/133.1.1 | url = https://academic.oup.com/jn/article/133/1/1/4687577 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Foods high in [[Calcium in biology|calcium]] eaten simultaneously with foods containing [[iron]] can decrease the absorption of iron via an unclear mechanism involving iron [[transport protein]] h[[DMT1]], which calcium can inhibit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Scheers N | title = Regulatory effects of Cu, Zn, and Ca on Fe absorption: the intricate play between nutrient transporters | journal = Nutrients | volume = 5 | issue = 3 | pages = 957–70 | date = March 2013 | pmid = 23519291 | pmc = 3705329 | doi = 10.3390/nu5030957 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[Protein (nutrient)|proteins]] can also be antinutrients, such as the [[trypsin inhibitor]]s and [[lectin]]s found in [[legume]]s. These [[enzyme inhibitor]]s interfere with digestion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gilani GS, Cockell KA, Sepehr E | title = Effects of antinutritional factors on protein digestibility and amino acid availability in foods | journal = Journal of AOAC International | volume = 88 | issue = 3 | pages = 967–87 | date = May 2005 | pmid = 16001874 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Avidin]] is an antinutrient found in active form in raw [[egg white]]s.

Widespread form of antinutrients are the [[flavonoid]]s, which are a group of [[polyphenol]]ic compounds that include [[tannin]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Beecher GR | title = Overview of dietary flavonoids: nomenclature, occurrence and intake | journal = The Journal of Nutrition | volume = 133 | issue = 10 | pages = 3248S-3254S | date = October 2003 | pmid = 14519822 | doi = 10.1093/jn/133.10.3248S | url = http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=14519822 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These compounds [[chelate]] metals such as iron and zinc and reduce the absorption of these nutrients,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Karamać M | title = Chelation of Cu(II), Zn(II), and Fe(II) by tannin constituents of selected edible nuts | journal = International Journal of Molecular Sciences | volume = 10 | issue = 12 | pages = 5485–97 | date = December 2009 | pmid = 20054482 | pmc = 2802006 | doi = 10.3390/ijms10125485 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but they also inhibit digestive enzymes and may also precipitate proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Adamczyk B, Simon J, Kitunen V, Adamczyk S, Smolander A | title = Tannins and Their Complex Interaction with Different Organic Nitrogen Compounds and Enzymes: Old Paradigms versus Recent Advances | journal = ChemistryOpen | volume = 6 | issue = 5 | pages = 610–614 | date = October 2017 | pmid = 29046854 | pmc = 5641916 | doi = 10.1002/open.201700113 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Saponin]]s in plants may serve as [[insecticide|anti-feedant]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Moses T, Papadopoulou KK, Osbourn A | title = Metabolic and functional diversity of saponins, biosynthetic intermediates and semi-synthetic derivatives | journal = Critical Reviews in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology | volume = 49 | issue = 6 | pages = 439–62 | date = 2014 | pmid = 25286183 | pmc = 4266039 | doi = 10.3109/10409238.2014.953628 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sparg SG, Light ME, van Staden J | title = Biological activities and distribution of plant saponins | journal = Journal of Ethnopharmacology | volume = 94 | issue = 2-3 | pages = 219–43 | date = October 2004 | pmid = 15325725 | doi = 10.1016/j.jep.2004.05.016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and can be classified as antinutrients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Difo VH, Onyike E, Ameh DA, Njoku GC, Ndidi US | title = Changes in nutrient and antinutrient composition of Vigna racemosa flour in open and controlled fermentation | journal = Journal of Food Science and Technology | volume = 52 | issue = 9 | pages = 6043–8 | date = September 2015 | pmid = 26345026 | pmc = 4554638 | doi = 10.1007/s13197-014-1637-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Occurrence ==
Antinutrients are found at some level in almost all foods for a variety of reasons. However, their levels are reduced in modern crops, probably as an outcome of the process of [[domestication]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Plant Toxins and Antinutrients |author=GEO-PIE Project |publisher=[[Cornell University]] |url=http://www.geo-pie.cornell.edu/issues/toxins.html |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612160331/http://www.geo-pie.cornell.edu/issues/toxins.html |archive-date=June 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The possibility now exists to eliminate antinutrients entirely using [[genetic engineering]]; but, since these compounds may also have beneficial effects, such genetic modifications could make the foods more nutritious but not improve people's health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Welch RM, Graham RD | title = Breeding for micronutrients in staple food crops from a human nutrition perspective | journal = Journal of Experimental Botany | volume = 55 | issue = 396 | pages = 353–64 | date = February 2004 | pmid = 14739261 | doi = 10.1093/jxb/erh064 | url = http://jexbot.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=14739261 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many traditional methods of food preparation such as [[fermentation (food)|fermentation]], [[cooking]], and [[malting]] increase the nutritive quality of plant foods through reducing certain antinutrients such as phytic acid, polyphenols, and oxalic acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hotz C, Gibson RS | title = Traditional food-processing and preparation practices to enhance the bioavailability of micronutrients in plant-based diets | journal = The Journal of Nutrition | volume = 137 | issue = 4 | pages = 1097–100 | date = April 2007 | pmid = 17374686 | doi = 10.1093/jn/137.4.1097 | url = http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=17374686 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such processing methods are widely used in societies where cereals and legumes form a major part of the diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chavan JK, Kadam SS | title = Nutritional improvement of cereals by fermentation | journal = Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition | volume = 28 | issue = 5 | pages = 349–400 | year = 1989 | pmid = 2692608 | doi = 10.1080/10408398909527507 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Phillips RD | title = Starchy legumes in human nutrition, health and culture | journal = Plant Foods for Human Nutrition | volume = 44 | issue = 3 | pages = 195–211 | date = November 1993 | pmid = 8295859 | doi = 10.1007/BF01088314 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An important example of such processing is the fermentation of [[cassava]] to produce cassava flour: this fermentation reduces the levels of both toxins and antinutrients in the tuber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Oboh G, Oladunmoye MK | title = Biochemical changes in micro-fungi fermented cassava flour produced from low- and medium-cyanide variety of cassava tubers | journal = Nutrition and Health | volume = 18 | issue = 4 | pages = 355–67 | year = 2007 | pmid = 18087867 | doi = 10.1177/026010600701800405 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42503">Within the United States, the use of [[asbestos]] is limited by state and federal regulations and legislation. Improper use of asbestos and injury from exposure is addressed through administrative action, litigation, and criminal prosecution. Injury claims arising from asbestos exposure may be tried as [[mass tort]]s.

==Civil litigation==
Asbestos litigation is the longest, most expensive mass tort in U.S. history, involving more than 8,000 defendants and 700,000 claimants.&lt;ref name="lloyds"&gt;{{cite web|title=Security Stranded Assets: the transition to a low carbon conomy|url=https://www.lloyds.com/~/media/files/news-and-insight/risk-insight/2017/stranded-assets.pdff|website=Lloyd's|accessdate=5 September 2017|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 1990s, "more than half of the 25 largest asbestos manufacturers in the US, including Amatex, Carey-Canada, Celotex, [[Eagle-Picher]], Forty-Eight Insulations, Manville Corporation, [[National Gypsum]], Standard Insulation, Unarco, and [[Rohn Industries|UNR Industries]] had declared [[bankruptcy]]. Analysts have estimated that the total costs of asbestos litigation in the U.S. alone will eventually reach $200 to $275&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name="lloyds"/&gt; The amounts and method of allocating compensation have been the source of many court cases, and government attempts at resolution of existing and future cases.

Claims made against employers by injured workers will typically be in the form of a [[Workers' compensation|workers compensation]] claim, although the long onset for diseases such as mesothelioma may make it impossible for a worker to pursue workers' compensation benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hopkins|first1=Jamie S.|title=Disease victims often shut out of workers' comp system|url=https://www.publicintegrity.org/2015/11/04/18816/disease-victims-often-shut-out-workers-comp-system|website=The Center for Public Integrity|accessdate=5 September 2017|date=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is possible for an injured worker to also bring a [[product liability]] claim against a third party that is responsible for introducing asbestos into the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Mesothelioma and Asbestosis - Asbestos Law and Litigation|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/environmental_law/mesothelioma.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=5 September 2017|date=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asbestos lawsuits in the U.S. have included the following as defendants:

===Common defenses===

====Third-party liability====
Manufacturers of machinery in which asbestos-containing parts were used have contested liability on the grounds that nearly all of them either did not ship asbestos-containing parts with their products at all (that is, asbestos was installed only by end users) or did not sell replacement parts for their own products (in cases where the plaintiff was allegedly exposed well after any factory-original asbestos-containing parts would have been replaced), and either way cannot be responsible for toxic third-party parts that they did not manufacture, distribute, or sell. In 2008, the [[Washington Supreme Court]], the first [[state supreme court]] to reach the issue, decided in favor of the defense.&lt;ref&gt;''Braaten v. Saberhagen Holdings'', 165 Wn.2d 373, 198 P.3d 493 (2008) and ''Simonetta v. Viad Corp.'', 165 Wn.2d 341, 197 P.3d 127 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; On January 12, 2012, the [[Supreme Court of California]] also decided in favor of the defense in ''O'Neil v. Crane Co.''&lt;ref&gt;''O'Neil v. Crane Co.'', 53 Cal.4th 335, 135 Cal. Rptr. 3d 288, 266 P.3d 987 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chrysotile vs. amphibole====
Another area of dispute remains the so-called [[chrysotile]]-defense. Manufacturers of some products containing only [[chrysotile]] fibers claim that these are not as harmful as [[amphibole]]-containing products. As 95% of the products used in the United States historically were mostly chrysotile, this claim is widely disputed by health officials and medical professionals.&lt;ref&gt;Straif K. The Carcinogenicity of Asbestos – Evaluations by IARC and WHO, Recent Developments and Global Burden of Asbestos-Related Cancer. Abstract SY02-07 of paper presented during Symposia: Asbestos – A Global Disaster in Seoul, Korea. Page 28-29, Collection of Conference Abstracts of The XVIII World Congress on Safety and Health at Work.&lt;/ref&gt;  The World Health Organization recognizes that exposure to all types of asbestos fibers, including chrysotile, can cause cancer of the lung, larynx, and ovary, [[mesothelioma]], and [[asbestosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/ipcs/assessment/public_health/chrysotile_asbestos_summary.pdf|title=Chrysotile Asbestos|last=|first=|date=2014|website=|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=2016-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ethics====
Defendants in asbestos litigation have accused the lawyers who represent plaintiffs of unethical conduct, but those allegations have not been successful in stopping the litigation, nor have courts been sufficiently convinced by the allegations to sanction the law firms against whom the allegations have been raised.&lt;ref name="Screen1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brickman|first1=Lester|title=Ethical Issues in Asbestos Litigation|journal=Hofstra Law Review|date=6 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Screening and solicitation: Defense firms allege that most lawsuits involving claims for non-malignant asbestos injuries are generated by asbestos screening companies, firms that are generally closely connected to trial lawyers but are run by people with no medical training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Duffy|first1=Shannon P.|title=Companies Seek Dismissal of Thousands of Asbestos Cases|url=http://www.thelegalintelligencer.com/id=900005549788/Companies-Seek-Dismissal-of-Thousands-of-Asbestos-Cases?slreturn=20170805133935|accessdate=5 September 2017|agency=The Legal Intelligencer|publisher=ALM Media Properties, LLC|date=12 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some legal scholars suggest that because lawyers often find screening companies using union locals as intermediaries the rule is not violated.&lt;ref name="Screen1"/&gt; Defendants also allege that plaintiffs' obtain diagnoses from physicians who do not follow proper standards when testing patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pal|first1=Shalmali|title=The back story on asbestos x-ray B readers|url=http://www.auntminnie.com/index.aspx?sec=ser&amp;sub=def&amp;pag=dis&amp;ItemID=62862|website=AuntMinnie.com|accessdate=5 September 2017|date=7 September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Excessive legal fees: Defendants have attempted to claim that contingency fees in asbestos cases are unreasonable, because the cases may not involve much risk or effort on the part of the plaintiff's lawyer. However, these claims have proved unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="Screen1"/&gt;
* Product identification: As product identification is the most important part of preparing witnesses in asbestos cases, plaintiffs must demonstrate that they were exposed to enough asbestos for a long enough time derived from the product of a particular defendant in order to win their claim. Defendants have claimed that plaintiffs' lawyers manipulate their clients to identify solvent companies as suppliers instead of those that have filed for bankruptcy. No court has accepted this allegation.&lt;ref name="Screen1"/&gt;

===Asbestos bankruptcy trusts===
Since the bankruptcy filing of Johns-Manville in 1984, many U.S. and U.K. asbestos manufacturers have avoided litigation by filing bankruptcy. Asbestos bankruptcy trusts are personal injury [[Trust law|trust]]s established by firms that have filed for reorganization under [[Chapter 11]] of the [[United States Bankruptcy Code]] to pay [[personal injury]] claims caused by exposure to asbestos. At least fifty-six trusts were established from the mid-1970s through 2011.&lt;ref name="trustbook"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dixon|first1=Lloyd|last2=McGovern|first2=Geoffrey|title=Asbestos Bankruptcy Trusts and Tort Compensation|date=2011|publisher=Rand Institute for Civil Justice|location=Santa Monica, California|isbn=9780833058348}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest 26 of these trusts paid about 2.4 million claims totaling about $10.9 billion up to 2008.&lt;ref name="trustbook"/&gt; The trusts are governed by trust advisory committees that are generally controlled by lawyers from a few prominent law firms such as [[Baron &amp; Budd, P.C.]] and [[Weitz &amp; Luxenberg P.C.]]&lt;ref name="ForbesOne"/&gt;

Bankruptcy trusts may pay pennies on the dollar to people injured as a result of asbestos exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carroll|first1=Stephen J.|last2=Hensler|first2=Deborah R.|last3=Gross|first3=Jennifer|last4=Sloss|first4=Elizabeth M.|last5=Schonlau|first5=Matthias|title=Asbestos Litigation|date=7 July 2005|publisher=Rand Corporation|isbn=0833040529|page=102|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sww7qFnHR-MC&amp;pg=PA102}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, these trusts may permit larger numbers of claimants to receive some kind of compensation, even if greatly reduced from potential recoveries in the tort system.

====Medicaid and Medicare reimbursement====
The federal Medicare Secondary Payer law imposes penalties for paying settlements directly to claimants without repaying the government for medical costs covered under the same programs under the legal doctrine of [[subrogation]].&lt;ref name="ForbesOne"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fisher|first1=Daniel|title=State AGs Probe Asbestos Bankruptcy Trusts To Recover Medicare Payments|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielfisher/2017/03/20/state-ags-probe-asbestos-bankruptcy-trusts-to-recover-medicare-payments/#3d27ac047ce2|accessdate=14 April 2017|publisher=Forbes|date=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2016, attorneys general from 13 states sent demand letters to bankruptcy trusts for [[Armstrong World Industries]], [[Babcock &amp; Wilcox]], DII, and [[Owens Corning]]. The purpose of the demand letters was to determine if the funds are reimbursing states for medical treatment received under [[Medicaid]] and [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wilson|first1=Drew|title=Alabama joins dozen states in asbestos bankruptcy trust investigations|url=https://altoday.com/archives/16031-alabama-ag-joins-asbestos-bankruptcy-trust-lawsuit|accessdate=27 November 2017|publisher=Alabama Today|date=27 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bankruptcy trusts and litigated claims====

The pursuit of compensation for asbestos injuries often involves both litigation against solvent defendants and filing claims against asbestos bankruptcy trusts.&lt;ref name="RAND1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dixon|first1=Lloyd|last2=McGovern|first2=Geoffrey|title=Bankruptcy's Effect on Product Identification in Asbestos Personal Injury Cases|url=https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR907.html|publisher=RAND|accessdate=27 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The amount of compensation recovered by an injured plaintiff may depend on whether evidence of exposure to products from bankrupt firms is introduced at trial. If no evidence of exposure from bankrupt firms is presented then increased financial responsibility is likely to be assigned to solvent defendants.&lt;ref name="RAND1"/&gt; Researchers from [[RAND | RAND Corporation]] found that if a company filed for bankruptcy plaintiffs claimed exposure to their products in interrogatories and depositions at significantly reduced rates.&lt;ref name="RAND1"/&gt;

When a plaintiff claiming an asbestos injury has filed a claim against a solvent defendant, courts may extend or reopen discovery when it is discovered that the plaintiff failed to disclose a trust claims. For example, in the 2008 case of ''Edwards v. John  Crane-Houdaille, Inc'' production of claim forms was delayed until two weeks before trial.&lt;ref&gt;''Edwards v. John Crane-Houda ille, Inc.'', No. 24X08000351  (Md. Cir. Ct. Balt.   City July 31, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2004 case of ''Stoeckler v. American Oil Co.''&lt;ref&gt;Stoeckler v. Am. Oil Co., No. 23,451  (Tex. Dist. Ct. Angelina Cnty. Jan. 28, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; the defendants discovered that the plaintiff did not disclose trust claims only three days after the start of the trial, resulting in the re-opening of discovery.&lt;ref name="brickman1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brickman|first1=Lester|title=Fraud and Abuse in Mesothelioma Litigation|journal=Tulane Law Review|date=July 2014|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2458144|accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; To help avoid this type of issue, Judges will often adopt mandatory disclosure obligations for bankruptcy trust claims.&lt;ref name="brickman1"/&gt;

==Regulation==
According to a September 2004 of the ''American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine'', asbestos is still a hazard for 1.3&amp;nbsp;million US workers in the construction industry and for workers involved in the maintenance of buildings and equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/medicalnews.php?newsid=13500 |title=American Thoracic Society Journal news tips for September 2004 (second issue) |publisher=Medicalnewstoday.com |accessdate=2010-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asbestos is not part of an [[ASTM International|ASTM]] (American Society for Testing and Materials) E 1527-05 Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA){{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}. A building survey for asbestos is considered an out-of-scope consideration under the industry standard ASTM 1527-05 Phase I ESA (see ASTM E 1527-05). ASTM Standard E 2356-04 should be consulted by the owner or owner's agent to determine which type of asbestos building survey is appropriate, typically either a baseline survey or a design survey of functional areas. Both types of surveys are explained in detail under ASTM Standard E 2356-04. Typically, a baseline survey is performed by an EPA (or state) licensed asbestos inspector. The baseline survey provides the buyer with sufficient information on presumed asbestos at the facility, often which leads to reduction in the assessed value of the building (due primarily to forthcoming abatement costs). Note: EPA [[National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants|NESHAP]] (National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants) and [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) Regulations must be consulted in addition to ASTM Standard E 2356-04 to ensure all statutory requirements are satisfied, ex. notification requirements for renovation/demolition. Asbestos is not a material covered under [[Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act|CERCLA]] (Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act ) innocent purchaser defense. In some instances, the U.S. EPA includes asbestos contaminated facilities on the NPL (Superfund). Buyers should be careful not to purchase facilities, even with an ASTM E 1527-05 Phase I ESA completed, without a full understanding of all the hazards in a building or at a property, without evaluating non-scope ASTM E 1527-05 materials, such as asbestos, lead, PCBs, mercury, radon, et al. A standard ASTM E 1527-05 does not include asbestos surveys as standard practice.

===Federal===
In 1988, the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency|United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA)]] issued regulations requiring certain U.S. companies to report the asbestos used in their products.&lt;ref name="cornell"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/2607|publisher=law.cornell.edu|title=15 U.S. Code § 2607 - Reporting and retention of information &amp;#124; US Law &amp;#124; LII / Legal Information Institute &amp;#124; Asbestos Information Act of 1988 |accessdate=2016-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Senate subcommittee of the Health Education Labor and Pensions Committee heard testimony on July 31, 2001, regarding the health effects of asbestos. Members of the public, doctors, and scientists called for the United States to join other countries in a ban on the product.&lt;ref name="btinternet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btinternet.com/~ibas/lka_us_congress.htm |publisher=web.archive.org |title=Summer Asbestos Hearing in US Congress |accessdate=2016-11-01 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011122183531/http://www.btinternet.com/~ibas/lka_us_congress.htm |archivedate=2001-11-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several legislative remedies have been considered by the U.S. Congress but each time rejected for a variety of reasons. In 2005, Congress considered but did not pass legislation entitled the "Fairness in Asbestos Injury Resolution Act of 2005". The act would have established a $140&amp;nbsp;billion trust fund in lieu of litigation, but as it would have proactively taken funds held in reserve by bankruptcy trusts, manufacturers and insurance companies, it was not widely supported either by victims or corporations.

On April 26, 2005, Dr. [[Philip J. Landrigan]], professor and chair of the Department of Community and Preventive Medicine at [[Mount Sinai Medical Center]] in New York City,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Testimony of Dr. Philip Landrigan, April 26, 2005|url=https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Landrigan%20Testimony%20042605.pdf|website=Committee on the Judiciary|publisher=United States Senate|accessdate=26 November 2017|date=26 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; testified before the US Senate Committee on the Judiciary against this proposed legislation. He testified that many of the bill's provisions were unsupported by medicine and would unfairly exclude a large number of people who had become ill or died from asbestos: "The approach to the diagnosis of disease caused by asbestos that is set forth in this bill is not consistent with the diagnostic criteria established by the American Thoracic Society. If the bill is to deliver on its promise of fairness, these criteria will need to be revised."  Also opposing the bill were the American Public Health Association and the Asbestos Workers' Union.&lt;ref name="pitt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2005/05/senate-judiciary-committee-wants.php |title=JURIST - Paper Chase: Senate Judiciary Committee wants sickest asbestos victims compensated fastest |publisher=Jurist.law.pitt.edu |date=2005-05-12 |accessdate=2010-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110111103453/http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2005/05/senate-judiciary-committee-wants.php |archivedate=2011-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 14, 2006, the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]] approved an amendment to the act which would have allowed victims of [[mesothelioma]] $1.1M within 30 days of their claim's approval.&lt;ref name="pitt"/&gt; This version would have also expanded eligible claimants to people exposed to asbestos from the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center, and to construction debris in hurricanes Katrina and Rita.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Asbestos Bill To Include 9/11, Storm Claims|url=http://www.floordaily.net/flooring-news/asbestos-bill-to-include-911-storm-claims|website=Floor Daily|accessdate=5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, the bill's reliance on funding from private entities large and small, as well as debate over a [[sunset provision]] and the impact on the U.S. budgetary process caused the bill to fail to leave committee.
According to the [[Environmental Working Group]] Action Fund, 10,000 people die each year from asbestos-caused diseases in the United States, including one out of every 125 American men who die over the age of 50.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewg.org/reports/asbestos/facts/fact1.php |title=The Asbestos Epidemic in America |publisher=EWG |accessdate=2010-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Environmental Protection Agency ([[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]]) has no general ban on the use of asbestos. However, asbestos was one of the first hazardous [[Air pollution|air pollutants]] regulated under Section 112 of the Clean Air Act of 1970, and many applications have been forbidden by the [[Toxic Substances Control Act]] (TSCA).

===State===
In 2010, Washington state passed a ban on hazardous materials in automotive brakes, phasing out asbestos in vehicle brakes, starting in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Better Brakes Law|url=http://www.ecy.wa.gov/programs/hwtr/betterbrakes.html|website=Department of Ecology|publisher=State of Washington|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Ohio passed became the first state to pass a law requiring transparency in asbestos bankruptcy trust claims.&lt;ref name="wire1"&gt;{{cite news|title=U.S. Chamber Report: Ohio Law to Curb ‘Double Dip’ Asbestos Claims Ensures Fairness Without Burdening Plaintiffs|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170504006128/en/U.S.-Chamber-Report-Ohio-Law-Curb-‘Double|publisher=Business Wire|date=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year Oklahoma passed a similar law called The Personal Injury Trust Fund Transparency Act. This law applies to all personal injury trusts. It requires plaintiffs to disclose all previously filed and anticipated trust claims for personal injuries within 90 days of filing a personal injury tort but not until at least 180 days before the assigned court date. If the plaintiff anticipates filing a trust claim all proceedings are stayed until their filing is complete. Filing new claims or amending claims after the initial disclosure triggers a new disclosure requirement. The law also allows defendants to stay proceedings by showing that the plaintiff could make a good faith filing with a trust. The law gives plaintiffs ten days to either file such a claim or show that it would probably be unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="brickman1"/&gt;

In South Carolina in 2015, State Senator Shane Massey introduced Senate Bill 281, "The Court Transparency Act."  S.281 would prohibit the state of South Carolina from hiring outside lawyers. Similar bills have been passed into law by 18 states. The bill would also prevent juries from awarding damages that exceed actual out of pocket costs incurred by plaintiffs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=January 21, 2015 - CAGC legislative issues, North Carolina and South Carolina construction news |url=http://www.cagc.org/advocacy/openwba/legis_update_012115.cfm |website=www.cagc.org |accessdate=2015-11-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151118164001/http://www.cagc.org/advocacy/openwba/legis_update_012115.cfm |archivedate=November 18, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Sen.

In June 2015, Texas Governor [[Greg Abbott]], a Republican, signed Texas House Bill 1492 into law.

In June 2016, President Obama signed into law the Frank R. Lautenburg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act (H.R. 2576). It serves to reform the TSCA of 1976 and aims to make federal safety regulations on toxic substances and chemicals effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/assessing-and-managing-chemicals-under-tsca/frank-r-lautenberg-chemical-safety-21st-century-act | title = The Frank R.

==Abatement==
{{main| Asbestos abatement}}
[[File:AsbestosContainment.JPG|right|thumb|275px|Old [[Wailuku]] [[Post Office]] sealed off for asbestos removal.]]
Asbestos abatement (removal of asbestos) has become a thriving industry in the United States. Strict removal and disposal laws have been enacted to protect the public from airborne asbestos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Asbestos Laws and Regulations|url=https://www.epa.gov/asbestos/asbestos-laws-and-regulations|website=Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Clean Air Act requires that asbestos be wetted during removal and strictly contained, and that workers wear safety gear and masks. The federal government has prosecuted dozens of violations of the act and violations of [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act]] (RICO) related to the operations. Often these involve contractors who hire undocumented workers without proper training or protection to illegally remove asbestos.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/24/nyregion/father-and-son-get-long-terms-in-defective-asbestos-removal.html Father and Son Get Long Terms In Defective Asbestos Removal"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', December 24, 2004. Retrieved 2008-04-04.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[W. R. Grace and Company]] faces fines of up to $280&amp;nbsp;million for polluting the town of [[Libby, Montana]]. Libby was declared a [[Superfund]] disaster area in 2002, and the EPA has spent $54&amp;nbsp;million in cleanup. Grace was ordered by a court to reimburse the EPA for cleanup costs, but the bankruptcy court must approve any payments.&lt;ref name="baltimoresun"/&gt;

==Notable cases==
===Civil===
The U.S. Supreme Court has dealt with several asbestos-related cases since 1986. Two large [[class action]] settlements, designed to limit liability, came before the court in 1997 and 1999. Both settlements were ultimately rejected by the court because they would exclude future claimants, or those who later developed asbestos-related illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/96-270.ZO.html |title=Amchem Products, Inc. v. Windsor, 117 S.Ct. 2231, 138 L.Ed.2d 689 (1997) |publisher=Law.cornell.edu |accessdate=2011-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/97-1704.ZS.html |title=Ortiz V. Fibreboard Corp |publisher=Law.cornell.edu |accessdate=2011-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; These rulings addressed the 20-50 year latency period of serious asbestos-related illnesses.

====''Borel v. Fibreboard Corp.''====
In this case a federal appeals court ruled that an insulation installer from Texas could sue asbestos manufactures for failure to warn. Borel's lawyers argued that had warning labels been affixed to Fiberboard's products he would have been able to protect himself more effectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Borel v. Fibreboard Paper Products Corporation, 493 F. 2d 1076 (5th Cir. 1973)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10469427978676917319|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Manville====
The Manville Corporation, formerly the [[Johns Manville|Johns-Manville]] Corporation, filed for reorganization and protection under the United States Bankruptcy Code in August 1982. At the time, it was the largest company ever to file bankruptcy, and was one of the richest. Manville was then 181st on the [[Fortune 500]], but was the defendant of 16,500 lawsuits related to the health effects of asbestos. The company was described by [[Ron Motley]], a South Carolina attorney, as "the greatest corporate mass murderer in history." Court documents show that the corporation had a long history of hiding evidence of the ill effects of asbestos from its workers and the public. One of many examples is a memo from Manville's medical director to corporate headquarters:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewg.org/reports/asbestos/printerfriendly.php |title=Asbestos |publisher=EWG |accessdate=2010-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070608074844/http://www.ewg.org/reports/asbestos/printerfriendly.php |archivedate=2007-06-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:The fibrosis of this disease is irreversible and permanent so that eventually compensation will be paid to each of these men. But, as long as the man is not disabled it is felt that he should not be told of his condition so that he can live and work in peace and the company can benefit from his many years of experience.

====Garlock====
In a decision from January 2014, ''[[Gray v. Garlock Sealing Technologies]]'' had entered into bankruptcy proceedings, and discovery in the case uncovered evidence of fraud &lt;ref name="legalnewsline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legalnewsline.com/issues/asbestos/247203-defense-attorney-says-filing-bankruptcy-trust-claims-after-trial-verdicts-is-issue-in-asbestos-litigation|author=Heather Isringhausen Gvillo|publisher=legalnewsline.com|title=Defense attorney: Judges should look for asbestos claims fraud &amp;#124; Legal News Line|accessdate=2016-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; that led to a reduction in estimated future liability to a tenth of what was estimated.

====RICO cases====
A number of lawsuits have been filed under the [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act]] (RICO) in response to what defendants claim to be fraudulent asbestos-related lawsuits. RICO suits are civil in nature and brought by private parties. They typically allege that the suits themselves are forms of racketeering or that lawyers and experts had to engage in racketeering activities in order to bring them.&lt;ref name="Journo1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Engstrom|first1=Nora Freeman|title=Retaliatory RICO and the Puzzle of Fraudulent Claiming|journal=Michigan Law Journal|date=2017|volume=115:639|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example,
*in 2012 a lawsuit was filed by CSX Transportation Inc. alleging that lawyers and a doctor who represented plaintiffs in asbestos cases had engaged in acts of civil racketering in their pursuit of fraudulent claims, resulting in a verdict in favor of CSX Transportation.&lt;ref name="Insurance"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Staff|title=W.Va. Jury Finds Doctor, 2 Lawyers Filed False Asbestos Claims|agency=Associated Press|publisher=Insurance Journal|date=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lawsuit was later settled on appeal, leaving in place the civil racketeering verdict in favor of CSX Transportation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Field|first1=Emily|title=CSX, Asbestos Attys End 4th Circ.

*In 2014, attorneys for Garlock Sealing Technologies, LLC, filed a lawsuit against four asbestos litigation firms, alleging civil racketeering.&lt;ref name=WashExamine-2014-09-12&gt;{{cite web|author1=Legal Newsline Staff Writer|title=Future could see more RICO cases like Garlock’s, expert says|url=http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/future-could-see-more-rico-cases-like-garlocks-expert-says/article/feed/2164264|website=[[Washington Examiner]]|accessdate=10 November 2014|date=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2016 Garlock, and its parent company EnPro, entered into a settlement that involved the dismissal of their racketeering claims and the payment of $480 million to settle related asbestos injury claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=EnPro, Garlock reach $480 million settlement on asbestos claims|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-enpro-industriesgarlock-asbestosclaim/enpro-garlock-reach-480-million-settlement-on-asbestos-claims-idUSKCN0WK0DP|accessdate=26 November 2017|agency=Reuters|date=18 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 2016, [[John Crane Group]] filed lawsuits against [[Simon Greenstone Panatier]] and [[Shein Law Center]] in federal court, alleging that the defendant law firms withheld evidence in violation of the RICO Act.&lt;ref name="RICO1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bronstad|first1=Amanda|title=RICO Action Filed Against Asbestos Lawyers|url=https://www.law.com/nationallawjournal/almID/1202759600617/|accessdate=26 November 2017|publisher=National Law Journal|date=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the defendant law firms has filed a motion to dismiss the claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kennedy|first1=John|title=Dallas Trial Firm Asks 7th Circ.

===Criminal===
Some companies and their executives have faced criminal prosecution for their actions in exposing workers to the dangers of asbestos, or their improper handling of asbestos waste.

====Adamo Wrecking Company====
On February 20, 1973 a federal grand jury in [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]] indicted Adamo Wrecking Company ("Adamo") for violating provisions of the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] by knowingly causing the emission of asbestos by failure to wet and remove friable asbestos materials from demolitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Preview of United States Supreme Court Cases, Oct. 1977 Term|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/prvw5&amp;div=1&amp;src=home|website=Hein Online|publisher=American Bar Association|accessdate=5 November 2017|date=6 September 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adamo was one of a number of demolition contractors indicted throughout the country for the alleged violation of the Clean Air Act. The [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan]] dismissed the criminal indictment on the ground that it was not an "emission standard," but a "work practice standard," which under the terms of the statute, did not carry criminal liability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Olson|first1=Sigrid|title=Emission Standards - Quantification and Liability|journal=Natural Resources Journal|volume=18|issue=3|page=677|url=http://digitalrepository.unm.edu/nrj/vol18/iss3/13/|accessdate=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government appealed and the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit|Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals]] reversed the decision of the trial court, stating that it erred in determining that it had jurisdiction to review the validity of the standard in a criminal proceeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United States v. Adamo Wrecking Co., 545 F.2d 1, 3 (6th Cir. 1976)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16010077950238678835|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=5 November 2017|date=15 June 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adamo's attorneys appealed to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]].&lt;ref&gt;"Summary of Actions by Supreme Court on Various Cases", ''New York Times'', April 5, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 10, 1978, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Adamo when it held that the trial court did have jurisdiction to review the standard in a criminal proceeding and also agreed with the trial court that the requirements in the act were "not standards" but "procedures" and therefore the proceedings were properly dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weaver|first1=Warren|title=Court Allows More Challenges of E.P.A. Regulations|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1978/01/11/archives/court-allows-more-challenges-of-epa-regulations.html|accessdate=5 November 2017|publisher=New York Times|date=11 January 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adamo Wrecking Co. v.

====W. R. Grace and Company====
A federal [[grand jury]] indicted [[W. R. Grace and Company]] and seven top executives on February 5, 2005, for its operations of a [[vermiculite]] mine in [[Libby, Montana]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewg.org/reports/lungcancer/wrgrace.php EWG.org]&lt;/ref&gt;  The indictment accused Grace of [[wire fraud]], knowing endangerment of residents by concealing air monitoring results, obstruction of justice by interfering with an [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) investigation, violation of the Clean Air Act, providing asbestos materials to schools and local residents, and conspiracy to release asbestos and cover up health problems from asbestos contamination. The [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] said 1,200 residents had developed asbestos-related diseases and some had died, and there could be many more injuries and deaths.&lt;ref name="baltimoresun"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hancock|first1=Jay|title=Proving criminal intent in handling of asbestos products won't be easy|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2005-02-09/business/0502090155_1_asbestos-grace-criminally-charged|accessdate=5 September 2017|agency=The Baltimore Sun|date=9 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="usatoday"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/manufacturing/2005-02-08-grace-asbestos_x.htm|publisher=usatoday.com|title=Indictment charges W.R. Grace over asbestos |accessdate=2016-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 8, 2006, a federal judge dismissed the [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] charge of "knowing endangerment" because some of the defendant officials had left the company before the five-year statute of limitations had begun to run. The wire fraud charge was dropped by prosecutors in March.

====Other prosecutions====
On April 2, 1998, three men were indicted in a conspiracy to use homeless men for illegal asbestos removal from an aging Wisconsin manufacturing plant. Then-US Attorney General [[Janet Reno]] said, "Knowingly removing asbestos improperly is criminal. Exploiting the homeless to do this work is cruel."{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

On December 12, 2004, owners of New York asbestos abatement companies were sentenced to the longest federal jail sentences for environmental crimes in U.S. history, after they were convicted on 18 counts of conspiracy to violate the Clean Air Act and the [[Toxic Substances Control Act]], and actual violations of the Clean Air Act and Racketeer-Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. The crimes involved a 10-year scheme to illegally remove asbestos. The RICO counts included obstruction of justice, money laundering, mail fraud and bid rigging, all related to the asbestos cleanup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yosemite.epa.gov/opa/admpress.nsf/b1ab9f485b098972852562e7004dc686/324c5937dc68015a85256f7e0076a213!OpenDocument |title=12/23/2004: Father and Son Sentenced to Longest U.S. Jail Terms for Environmental Crimes |publisher=Yosemite.epa.gov |date=2004-12-23 |accessdate=2010-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 11, 2006, San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co., two of its employees, and a contractor were indicted by a federal grand jury on charges that they violated safety standards while removing asbestos from pipes in [[Lemon Grove, California]]. The defendants were charged with five counts of conspiracy, violating asbestos work practice standards and [[making false statements]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

The determination of the safety of a medication can be evaluated by considering the following:
*If and how much of the drug is present in breastmilk.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
*The age and maturity of the infant. [[Full term]] infants are better able to [[metabolize]] medications than [[premature infant]]s.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}
*The weight of the infant.
*The amount and percentage of breastmilk consumed by the infant. An infant taking solid foods with breastfeeding will receive a lower dose of medication.
*The general health of the infant and the general health of the mother.
*The nature of the mother's illness, if present.
*The general information about the drug other literature documenting studies related to the drug and breastfeeding.
*The duration of the drug therapy.
*Is the drug short-acting? A short-acting form of the drug may be a better choice for a breastfeeding mother rather than a longer-acting form that stays in the mother's system for a longer period.
*How is the medication being given? 
*Does the drug interfere with lactation?&lt;ref name = leche/&gt;

== Lactation risk categories ==
Drugs can be categorised in one of five categories to determine how safe they are for breastfeeding:&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Medications and Mothers' Milk 2017|last=Hale|first=Thomas Wright|last2=Rowe|first2=Hilary E.|date=2016-12-30|publisher=Springer Publishing Co Inc|isbn=9780826128584|edition=17th|location=New York|language=English|id= {{ASIN|0826128580|country=uk}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.medsmilk.com/pages/reading|title=Medications and Mothers Milk Online|website=www.medsmilk.com|access-date=2018-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://medref.cmbc.bc.ca/drug-standards/lactation-drug-risk-categories/|title=Lactation Drug Risk Categories|last=|first=|date=|work=CMBC Medical Reference|access-date=2018-03-24|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=aiVesab_2bwC&amp;pg=PA138&amp;lpg=PA138|title=Breastfeeding and Human Lactation|last=Riordan|first=Jan|date=2005|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning|year=|isbn=9780763745851|location=|pages=138|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== L1 Compatible ===

"Drug which has been taken by a large number of breastfeeding mothers without any observed increase in adverse effects in the infant. Controlled studies in breastfeeding women fail to demonstrate a risk to the infant and the possibility of harm to the breastfeeding infant is remote; or the product is not orally bioavailable in an infant."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== L2 Probably Compatible ===

"Drug which has been studied in a limited number of breastfeeding women without an increase in adverse effects in the infant. And/or, the evidence of a demonstrated risk which is likely to follow use of this medication in a breastfeeding woman is remote."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== L3 Probably Compatible ===

"There are no controlled studies in breastfeeding women, however the risk of untoward effects to a breastfed infant is possible; or, controlled studies show only minimal non-threatening adverse effects. Drugs should be given only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the infant. (New medications that have absolutely no published data are automatically categorized in this category, regardless of how safe they may be.)"&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== L4 Possibly Hazardous ===

"There is positive evidence of risk to a breastfed infant or to breastmilk production, but the benefits of use in breastfeeding mothers may be acceptable despite the risk to the infant (e.g. if the drug is needed in a life-threatening situation or for a serious disease for which safer drugs cannot be used or are ineffective)."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== L5 Hazardous ===

"Studies in breastfeeding mothers have demonstrated that there is significant and documented risk to the infant based on human experience, or it is a medication that has a high risk of causing significant damage to an infant. The risk of using the drug in breastfeeding women clearly outweighs any possible benefit from breastfeeding. The drug is contraindicated in women who are breastfeeding an infant."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Over the counter medications==
[[Over the counter medications]] are those medications that do not require a [[prescription drug|prescription]] to purchase in the US. Medications that require a prescription to purchase in the US may be available in other countries without a prescription. The following guidelines are recommended:

* taking oral medications after breastfeeding rather than before will allow some of the medication to leave the mother's body through her kidneys between nursings.
* in most women without kidney disease, [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug]]s and [[paracetamol]] (acetaminophen) are used safely.
* [[aspirin]] can cause rashes and even cause bleeding in infants.
* limit the use of antihistamines for long periods of time. These anti-allergy medications can cause crying, sleep problems, fussiness, excessive sleepiness in babies. Antihistamines have an effect on the amount of milk the body produces and decrease the supply.
* carefully observe the infant for changes or side effects when first taking a medication to watch for side effects. Side effects indicating that the medication is having an affect on the baby is difficulty breathing, rash and other questionable changes that occurred after the medication was started by the mother.
* many times other young children are in the home and keeping these over the counter medications out of their reach is a safe practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://familydoctor.org/otc-medicines-and-pregnancy/|title=OTC Medicines and Pregnancy - familydoctor.org|first=familydoctor.org editorial|last=staff|date=1 September 2005|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other substances or chemicals have been evaluated regarding their safe use during pregnancy. Hair dye or solutions used for a 'permanent' do not pass to breastmilk. No adverse reports of using oral antihistamines and breastfeeding are found. Some of the older antihistamines used by a nursing mother can cause drowsiness in the infant. This may be a concern if the infant misses feedings by sleeping instead of nursing.&lt;ref name = uk&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.breastfeedingnetwork.org.uk/detailed-information/drugs-in-breastmilk/drugs-faqs/|title= Drugs in Breastmilk -Is It Safe?|publisher= The Breasfeeding Network - Britains Nonprofit Breastfeeding Support Organization|accessdate=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CAMPHOR questionnaire was developed by Galen Research in 2006&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McKenna|first=S.P.|author2=Doughty, N.|author3= Meads, D.M.|author4= Doward, L.C.|author5= Pepke-Zaba, J.|title=The Cambridge Pulmonary Hypertension Outcome Review (CAMPHOR): A measure of health-related quality of life and quality of life for patients with pulmonary hypertension|journal=Quality of Life Research|year=2006|volume=15|pages=103–115|doi=10.1007/s11136-005-3513-4|url=http://download.springer.com/static/pdf/909/art%253A10.1007%252Fs11136-005-3513-4.pdf?auth66=1380882215_541823d4f6f118218ba780db9d3a5f32&amp;ext=.pdf|accessdate=2 October 2013|pmid=16411035|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; to allow for cost-utility analyses for treatments of PH.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meads|first=D.M.|author2=McKenna, S.P.|author3= Doughty, N.|author4= Das, C.|author5= Gin-Sing, W.|author6= Langley, J.|author7= Pepke-Zaba, J.|title=The responsiveness and validity of the CAMPHOR Utility Index.|journal=European Respiratory Journal|date=3 September 2008|volume=32|issue=6|pages=1513–1519|doi=10.1183/09031936.00069708|url=http://erj.ersjournals.com/content/32/6/1513.long|accessdate=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theoretical basis for the CAMPHOR is the needs-based model of quality of life, which states that quality of life is highest when an individual has the ability and capacity to satisfy their own needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hunt|first=Sonja M.|author2=McKenna, Stephen P.|title=The QLDS: A scale for the measurement of quality of life in depression|journal=Health Policy|date=October 1992|volume=22|issue=3|pages=307–319|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/016885109290004U#|accessdate=2 October 2013|doi=10.1016/0168-8510(92)90004-U|pmid=10122730}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Properties ==

The CAMPHOR is made up of 3 main dimensions which assess symptoms, functioning and quality of life (QoL).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McKenna|first=Stephen P.|author2=Ratcliffe, Julie|author3= Meads, David M|author4= Brazier, John E.|title=Development and validation of a preference based measure derived from the Cambridge Pulmonary Hypertension Outcome Review (CAMPHOR) for use in cost utility analyses|journal=Health And Quality Of Life Outcomes|year=2008|volume=6|issue=65|pages=1–8|doi=10.1186/1477-7525-6-65|url=http://www.hqlo.com/content/6/1/65|accessdate=2 October 2013|pmid=18718016|pmc=2546377}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; The symptom dimension is made up of 25 symptoms and is broken up into 3 subscales: energy, breathlessness and mood.  The QoL scale has 25 items which focus on socialization, role, acceptance, self-esteem, independence, and security. The activity scale has 15 items. Response options include true and not true.  Scores for QoL and symptoms range from 0-25, with higher scores indicating worse quality of life. Activity scores range from 0-30, with higher scores indicating more physical limitations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Matura|first=Lee Ann|author2=McDonough, Annette|author3= Carroll, Diane L.|title=Health-Related Quality of Life and Psychological States in Patients With Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension|journal=Journal of Cardiovascular Nursing|date=13 November 2012|pages=1–7|doi=10.1097/JCN.0b013e318275330d|url=http://journals.lww.com/jcnjournal/pages/articleviewer.aspx?year=9000&amp;issue=00000&amp;article=99809&amp;type=abstract|accessdate=2 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use in Clinical Trials ==

The Cambridge Pulmonary Hypertension Outcome Review has been a useful tool in clinical trials as it allows researchers to assess whether new medication or therapy is effective. The CAMPHOR has been utilized in clinical trials which investigate the effects of [[treprostinil]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Channick|first=Richard N.|author2=Voswinckel, Robert|author3= Rubin, Lewis J.|title=Inhaled treprostinil: a therapeutic review|journal=Drug Design, Development and Therapy|date=24 January 2012|volume=6|pages=19–28|doi=10.2147/DDDT.S19281|pmc=3267519|pmid=22291467}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chen|first=Hubert|author2=Rosenzweig, Erika B.|author3= Gotzkowsky, S Karl|author4= Arneson, Carl|author5= Nelsen, Andrew C.|author6= Bourge, Robert C.|title=Treatment satisfaction is associated with improved quality of life in patients treated with inhaled treprostinil for pulmonary arterial hypertension|journal=Health And Quality Of Life Outcomes|year=2013|volume=11|issue=31|pages=1–8|doi=10.1186/1477-7525-11-31|url=http://www.hqlo.com/content/11/1/31|accessdate=2 October 2013|pmid=23496856|pmc=3610124}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as trials which investigate [[sildenafil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tay|first=Edgar L.W.|author2=Papaphylactou, Maria|author3= Diller, Gerhard Paul|author4= Alonso-Gonzalez, Rafael|author5= Inuzuka, Ryo|author6= Giannakoulas, Georgios|author7= Harries, Carl|author8= Wort, Stephen John|author9= Swan, Lorna|author10= Dimopoulos, Konstantinos|author11= Gatzoulis, Michael A.|title=Quality of life and functional capacity can be improved in patients with Eisenmenger syndrome with oral sildenafil therapy|journal=International Journal of Cardiology|date=16 June 2011|volume=149|issue=3|pages=372–376|doi=10.1016/j.ijcard.2010.02.020|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167527310000872#|accessdate=2 October 2013|pmid=20304507}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Suntharalingam|first=Jay|author2=Treacy, Carmen M.|author3= Doughty, Natalie J.|author4= Goldsmith, Kimberley|author5= Soon, Elaine|author6= Toshner, Mark R.|author7= Sheares, Karen K.|author8= Hughes, Rodney|author9= Morrell, Nicholas W.|author10= Pepke-Zaba, Joanna|title=Long-term Use of Sildenafil in Inoperable Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension|journal=Chest|year=2008|volume=134|issue=2|pages=229–236|doi=10.1378/chest.07-2681|url=http://journal.publications.chestnet.org/article.aspx?articleid=1085998|accessdate=2 October 2013|pmid=18263674}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different religions have varying stances on the use of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], historically and presently. In ancient history some religions used cannabis as an [[entheogenic]], particularly in the [[Indian subcontinent]] where the tradition continues on a more limited basis.

In the modern era, religions with prohibitions against intoxicants, such as Islam, Buddhism, Bahai, Latter-day Saints (Mormons), and others have opposed the use of cannabis by members, or in some cases opposed the liberalization of cannabis laws. Other groups, such as some Protestant and Jewish factions, have supported the use of [[medicinal cannabis]].

==Bahá'í==
In the [[Bahá'í Faith]], use of alcohol and other drugs for intoxication, as opposed to medical prescription, is prohibited,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Khali Akhtar Khavari|author2=Teresa McCray Harmon|title=The Relationship between the Degree of Professed Religious Belief and Use of Drugs|journal=International Journal of the Addictions|volume=17|issue=5|pages=847–857|date=1982|doi=10.3109/10826088209056331}}&lt;/ref&gt; see [[Bahá'í laws]]. But Bahá'í practice is such laws should be applied with "tact and wisdom".&lt;ref name="PSmith"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= law |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 1-85168-184-1 |pages= 223–225}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of tobacco is an individual decision, it is yet strongly frowned on and not explicitly forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Udo Schaefer|title=In a blue haze, smoking and Bahá'í ethics|publisher=Zero Palm Press|edition=Translated from the original German language edition: Ethische Aspekte des Rauchens.

{{quote|Regarding [[hashish]] you have pointed out that some Persians have become habituated to its use. Gracious God! This is the worst of all intoxicants, and its prohibition is explicitly revealed. Its use causeth the disintegration of thought and the complete torpor of the soul. How could anyone seek the fruit of the infernal tree, and by partaking of it, be led to exemplify the qualities of a monster? How could one use this forbidden drug, and thus deprive himself of the blessings of the All-Merciful? Alcohol consumeth the mind and causeth man to commit acts of absurdity, but this opium, this foul fruit of the infernal tree, and this wicked hashish extinguish the mind, freeze the spirit, petrify the soul, waste the body and leave man frustrated and lost.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/KA/ka-187.html Notes #170.

==Buddhism==
In Buddhism, the [[Five Precepts|Fifth Precept]] is frequently interpreted to mean "refrain from intoxicating drinks and drugs which lead to heedlessness", although in some direct translations, the Fifth Precept refers specifically to alcohol.&lt;ref name="yinshun"&gt;{{cite book | last = Yin-Shun | first = Venerable | editor = Wing H.

==Christianity==

===Catholicism===
Prior to assuming his position as leader of the [[Catholic Church]], [[Pope Francis]] had spoken against recreational cannabis. He stated in 2013 in Buenos Aires: "A reduction in the spread and influence of drug addiction will not be achieved by a liberalization of drug use."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bindrim|first=Kira|title=Pope Francis Speaks Out Against Legalization of Marijuana and Other Drugs|url=http://www.newsweek.com/pope-francis-says-he-opposes-marijuana-legalization-255708|magazine=[[Newsweek]]|date=June 20, 2014|accessdate=September 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The catechism of the Catholic Church states that "The use of drugs inflicts very grave damage on health and life. Their use, except on strictly therapeutic grounds, is a grave offense."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/_P80.HTM |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church |publisher=Libreria Editrice Vaticana |date= |accessdate=2018-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints===
{{main|Cannabis and Latter-day Saints}}

In [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], there is general prohibition against intoxicating substances. In August 1915, the LDS Church banned the use of cannabis by its members. In 2016, the church's [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] urged members to oppose legalization of recreational cannabis use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=West|first=Camille|title=First Presidency Asks Members to Oppose Recreational Marijuana, Assisted Suicide|url=https://www.lds.org/church/news/first-presidency-asks-members-to-oppose-recreational-marijuana-assisted-suicide?lang=eng|publisher=Intellectual Reserve, Inc.|website=LDS.org|date=October 14, 2016|accessdate=September 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LDS Church says it has "raised no objection to SB 89" (non-psychoactive medical marijuana in Utah).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Church Urges 'Cautious Approach' on Medical Marijuana Issue in Utah|url=https://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/church-urges-cautious-approach-medical-marijuana-issue-utah|publisher=Intellectual Reserve, Inc.|website=MormonNewsroom.org|date=February 12, 2016|accessdate=September 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wells|first=David|title=LDS Church issues new statement on medical marijuana|url=http://fox13now.com/2016/02/12/lds-church-clarifies-stance-on-medical-marijuana/|publisher=[[KSTU]]|website=Fox13Now.com|date=February 12, 2016|accessdate=March 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orthodoxy===

The [[Assemblies of God USA]], as well as other [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] and [[Holiness Movement|holiness churches]], have historically advocated abstinence from all alcohol, tobacco, and narcotics. Supporters of this view generally cite biblical passages enjoining respect for one's body as well as forbidding intoxication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ag.org/top/Beliefs/topics/charctr_08_drugs.cfm | title = Alcohol, Tobacco &amp; Drugs | last = | first = | date = | website = ag.org | publisher = Assemblies of God USA | access-date = April 10, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Protestant churches have endorsed the legality of medical marijuana, including the [[Presbyterian Church (USA)]], [[United Methodist Church]], [[United Church of Christ]], and the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bosch |first=Torie |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2007/03/what_would_jesus_smoke.html |title=What do Christian groups think about marijuana? |work=Slate |date=2007-03-20 |accessdate=2017-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ganja Smoking - Gangasagar Fair Transit Camp - Kolkata 2013-01-12 2646.JPG|thumb|right|250px|A man smoking cannabis in [[Kolkata, India]].]]
During the [[Hindu]] festival of [[Holi]], people consume ''bhang'' which contains cannabis flowers.&lt;ref name="commission"&gt;{{cite book|title=Report of the Indian Hemp Drugs Commission|year=1894|location=Simla, India|publisher=Government Central Printing House|url=http://www.druglibrary.net/schaffer/Library/studies/inhemp/4chapt9.htm}} Chapter IX: Social and Religious Customs.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skunked.co.uk/articles/history-intoxicant.htm |title=The History of the Intoxicant Use of Marijuana |publisher=National Commission of Marijuana and Drug Abuse |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050813080240/http://www.skunked.co.uk/articles/history-intoxicant.htm |archivedate=2005-08-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to one description, when the ''[[amrita]]'' (elixir of life) was produced from the [[Samudra manthan|churning of the ocean]] by the devas and the asuras, [[Shiva]] created cannabis from his own body to purify the elixir (whence, for cannabis, the epithet ''angaja'' or "body-born"). Another account suggests that the cannabis plant sprang up when a drop of the elixir dropped on the ground. Thus, cannabis is used by [[rishi|sages]] due to association with elixir and [[Shiva]].

In Hinduism, wise drinking of ''bhang'' (which contains cannabis), according to religious rites, is believed to cleanse sins, unite one with [[Shiva]] and avoid the miseries of [[Naraka (Hinduism)|hell]] in the [[Saṃsāra|future life]]. It is also believed to have medicinal benefits. In contrast, foolish drinking of ''bhang'' without rites is considered a sin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/LIBRARY/studies/Inhemp/7relhemp.htm|title=Indian Hemp Drugs Commission Report - Appendix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islam==
{{Main|Halal|Islamic dietary laws}}
The [[Quran]] does not directly forbid cannabis; however, cannabis is deemed to be ''[[khamr (intoxicant)|khamr]]'' (an intoxicant) by many religious scholars and therefore generally believed to be ''[[haraam]]'' (forbidden).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Abdul-Rahman|first=Muhammad Saed|title=Islam: Questions and Answers - Pedagogy Education and Upbringing|publisher=MSA Publication Limited|year=2003|page=123| isbn= 978-1-86179-296-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pakistan Narcotics Control Board, Colombo Plan Bureau|title=First National Workshop on Prevention and Control of Drug Abuse in Pakistan 25–30 August 1975|location=Rawalpindi|publisher=Workshop Report|year=1975|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[hadith]] by the prophet Mohammed states: "If much intoxicates, then even a little is haraam."&lt;ref&gt;AD 25;5&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these prohibitions, cannabis is consumed in many parts of the Islamic world, even sometimes in a religious context particularly within the [[Sufi]] mystic movement.&lt;ref name="Ferrara2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark S.

Some modern Islamic leaders state that medical cannabis, but not recreational, is permissible in Islam. Imam Mohammad Elahi in [[Dearborn Heights]], Michigan (United States), declared: "Obviously, smoking marijuana for fun is wrong... It should be permissible only if that is the only option in a medical condition prescribed by medical experts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hijazi |first=Samer |url=http://www.arabamericannews.com/news/news/id_12118/Marijuana-in-Islam:-Smokers-and-scholars-weigh-in.html |title=Marijuana: Arab Smokers, religious scholars weigh in |publisher=Arabamericannews.com |date= |accessdate=2017-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judaism==
{{main|Cannabis and Judaism}}

Though the argument has not been accepted by mainstream scholars, some writers have theorized that cannabis may have been used ritually in early Judaism, though these claims "have been widely dismissed as erroneous".&lt;ref&gt;(Merlin, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Economic Botany]] [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1663/0013-0001(2003)057%5B0295:AEFTTO%5D2.0.CO%3B2#page-1  M. D. Merlin Archaeological Evidence for the Tradition of Psychoactive Plant Use in the Old World - University of Hawaii] "23 May 2011 - ".. Judaism (Dure 2001; Merkur 2000), and Christianity (Allegro 1970; Ruck et al. 2001). Although this hypothesis and some of the specific case studies (e.g., Allegro 1970) have been widely dismissed as erroneous, others continue"&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sula Benet]] (1967) claimed that the plant ''kaneh bosm קְנֵה-בֹשֶׂם'' mentioned five times in the Hebrew Bible, and used in the [[holy anointing oil]] of the Book of Exodus, was in fact cannabis,&lt;ref&gt;Rowan Robinson, The Great Book of Hemp, Health &amp; Fitness, 1995, pag. 89&lt;/ref&gt; although lexicons of Hebrew and dictionaries of plants of the Bible such as by [[Michael Zohary]] (1985), [[Hans Arne Jensen]] (2004) and [[James A. Duke]] (2010) and others identify the plant in question as either ''[[Acorus calamus]]'' or ''[[Cymbopogon citratus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Lytton J. Musselman ''Figs, dates, laurel, and myrrh: plants of the Bible and the Quran'' 2007 p73&lt;/ref&gt;

In the modern era, Orthodox rabbi [[Moshe Feinstein]] stated in 1973 that cannabis was not permitted under Jewish law, due to its harmful effects.&lt;ref name="Jacobs1993"&gt;{{cite book|author=Julian G.

==Rastafari==
It is not known when [[Rastafari]] first claimed cannabis to be sacred, but it is clear that by the late 1940s Rastafari was associated with cannabis smoking at the Pinnacle community of [[Leonard Howell]]. Rastafari see cannabis as a sacramental and deeply beneficial plant that is the [[Tree of Life]] mentioned in the [[Bible]]. [[Peter Tosh]], among many others, has quoted {{bibleref2|Revelation|22:2}}, "... the herb is the healing of the nations."  The use of cannabis, and particularly of long-stemmed water-pipes called [[chalice (pipe)|chalices]], is an integral part of what Rastafari call "reasoning sessions" where members join together to discuss life according to the Rasta perspective. They see the use of cannabis as bringing them closer to [[God]] ([[Jah]]), allowing the user to penetrate the truth of things more clearly.

While it is not necessary to use cannabis to be a Rastafari, many use it regularly as a part of their faith, and pipes of cannabis are dedicated to His Imperial Majesty [[Haile Selassie I]] before being smoked. According to the [[Anti-cult movement|anti-cult group]] the [[Watchman Fellowship]] "The herb is the key to new understanding of the self, the universe, and God. It is the vehicle to cosmic consciousness"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.watchman.org/profile/rastapro.htm |title= Rastafarianism |work= Profiles |publisher= [[Watchman Fellowship|Watchman Fellowship ministry]] |first= Rick |last= Branch |year= 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is believed to burn the corruption out of the human heart. Rubbing the ashes into the skin from smoked cannabis is also considered a healthy practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Joseph Owens (Jesuit)|title=Dread, The Rastafarians of Jamaica|year=1974|isbn=0-435-98650-3|first=Joseph|last=Owens}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of the Rastafari movement, elders of the 20th-century religious movement known as the [[Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church]], consider cannabis to be the "eucharist",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nepenthes.lycaeum.org/Drugs/THC/bible.html|title=Marijuana and the Bible|publisher=[[Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; claiming it as an oral tradition from [[Ethiopia]] dating back to the time of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.erowid.org/plants/cannabis/cannabis_spirit2.shtml|title=Erowid Cannabis Vault : Spiritual Use #2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientology==
[[Scientology]] opposes the use of cannabis, and made "Truth About Marijuana" the focus of their 2016 [[World Health Day]] presentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientologynews.org/press-releases/activity/church-hosts-truth-about-marijuana-event.html |title=Church Hosts "Truth About Marijuana" Event |publisher=Scientologynews.org |date=2016-04-18 |accessdate=2017-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sikhism==
{{main|Cannabis and Sikhism}}
[[File:Process of making bhang in Punjab, India.jpg|thumb|Process of making bhang in a Sikh village in Punjab, India.&lt;br&gt;Photos taken by Marcus Prasad]]

In [[Sikhism]], the First Sikh Guru, [[Guru Nanak]], stated that using any mind altering substance (without medical purposes) is a distraction to keeping the mind clean of the name of God.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} According to the ''[[Sikh Rehat Maryada]]'', "A Sikh must not take hemp (cannabis), opium, liquor, tobacco, in short any intoxicant. His only routine intake should be food and water".&lt;ref name="amritworld.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amritworld.com/main/?p=82#sthash.agD98t5F.dpbs|title=The ‘Sukhnidhaan’ or ‘Bhang’ (cannabis)|work=Amrit World|accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there exists a tradition of Sikhs using edible cannabis, often in the form of the beverage [[bhang]], particularly among the Sikh community known as [[Nihang]].&lt;ref name="SinghFenech2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Pashaura Singh|author2=Louis E.

==Taoism==

Beginning around the 4th century, Taoist texts mentioned using cannabis in [[censer]]s. Needham cited the (ca. 570 AD) Taoist encyclopedia ''Wushang Biyao'' 無上秘要 ("Supreme Secret Essentials") that cannabis was added into ritual incense-burners, and suggested the ancient Taoists experimented systematically with "hallucinogenic smokes".&lt;ref&gt;Needham and Lu (1974), [https://books.google.com/books?id=TTHGp0euKmoC&amp;pg=PA150&amp;lpg=PA150#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false p. 150]. From ancient Chinese fumigation techniques with "toxic smokes" for pests and "holy smokes" for demons, "what started as a 'smoking out' of undesirable things, changed now to a 'smoking in' of heavenly things into oneself."&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Yuanshi shangzhen zhongxian ji'' 元始上真眾仙記 ("Records of the Assemblies of the Perfected Immortals"), which is attributed to [[Ge Hong]] (283-343), says:

:For those who begin practicing the Tao it is not necessary to go into the mountains. … Some with purifying incense and sprinkling and sweeping are also able to call down the Perfected Immortals. The followers of the Lady Wei and of Hsu are of this kind.&lt;ref&gt;Needham and Lu (1974), p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lady [[Wei Huacun]] 魏華存 (252-334) and Xu Mi 許謐 (303-376) founded the Taoist [[Shangqing School]]. The Shangqing scriptures were supposedly dictated to [[Yang Xi]] 楊羲 (330-c. 386) in nightly revelations from [[Xian (Taoism)|immortals]], and Needham proposed Yang was "aided almost certainly by cannabis". The ''Mingyi bielu'' 名醫別錄 ("Supplementary Records of Famous Physicians"), written by the Taoist pharmacologist [[Tao Hongjing]] (456-536), who also wrote the first commentaries to the Shangqing canon, says, "Hemp-seeds (麻勃) are very little used in medicine, but the magician-technicians (''shujia'' 術家) say that if one consumes them with [[ginseng]] it will give one preternatural knowledge of events in the future."&lt;ref&gt;Needham and Lu (1974), [https://books.google.com/books?id=TTHGp0euKmoC&amp;pg=PA151&amp;lpg=PA151#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false p. 151].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Richard|last=Rudgley|url=http://cannabis.net/hist/index.html|title=The Encyclopedia of Psychoactive Substances|publisher=Little, Brown and Company|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 6th-century AD Taoist medical work, the ''Wuzangjing'' 五臟經 ("Five Viscera Classic") says, "If you wish to command demonic apparitions to present themselves you should constantly eat the inflorescences of the hemp plant."&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Needham, Ho Ping-Yu, and Lu Gwei-djen (1980). ''Science and Civilisation in China: Volume 5, Chemistry and Chemical Technology; Part 4, Spagyrical Discovery and Invention''. Cambridge University Press, [https://books.google.com/books?id=JvLroG7r2MYC&amp;pg=PA213#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false p. 213].&lt;/ref&gt;

Joseph Needham connected myths about [[Magu (deity)|Magu]], "the Hemp Damsel", with early Daoist religious usages of cannabis, pointing out that Magu was goddess of [[Shandong]]'s [[Sacred Mountains of China|sacred]] [[Mount Tai]], where cannabis "was supposed to be gathered on the seventh day of the seventh month, a day of seance banquets in the Taoist communities."&lt;ref&gt;Needham, Joseph. 1974. [https://books.google.com/books?id=TTHGp0euKmoC ''Science and Civilisation in China: Volume 5, Chemistry and Chemical Technology; Part 2, Spagyrical Discovery and Invention: Magisteries of Gold and Immortality''].

==Other cannabis-using religious movements==

Other religions have been founded in the past century that treat cannabis as a sacrament. They include the [[Santo Daime]] church, the [[THC Ministry]], Cantheism, the Cannabis Assembly, the Church of Cognitive Therapy (COCT Ministry), Temple 420, Green Faith Ministries, the [[Church of Cognizance]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mapinc.org/drugnews/v08/n848/a01.html|last=Innes|first=Stephanie|title=Pot-Deifying Duo Guilty, Confident They'll Avoid Prison|date=2008-09-05|work=[[Arizona Daily Star]]|publisher=[[Lee Enterprises]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Church of the Universe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mapinc.org/drugnews/v08/n1046/a05.html|last=Jackson|first=Hayes|title=Appeal Date Set For Pot Priests|work=[[The Hamilton Spectator]]|year=2008|publisher=[[Torstar]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iamm.com|title=Church of the Universe|publisher=[[Church of the Universe]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Free Marijuana Church of Honolulu, the First Cannabis Church of Florida World Wide,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cannabischurchfl.com/ First Cannabis Church of Florida]&lt;/ref&gt; the Free Life Ministry Church of Canthe, the Church of Higher Consciousness, and the federally tax-exempt inFormer Ministry Collective of Palms Springs, CA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informer.org|title=InFormer Ministry}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informer.org/9900001.jpg|title=Rev.

Modern spiritual figures like [[Ram Dass]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drugpolicy.org/library/ramdass.cfm |title=Ram Dass: Longtime Spiritual Leader, Opponent of the 'War on Drugs' |date=2004-03-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920210640/http://drugpolicy.org/library/ramdass.cfm |archivedate=2008-09-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; openly acknowledge that the use of cannabis has allowed them to gain a more spiritual perspective and use the herb frequently for both its medicinal and mind-altering properties.

In Mexico, followers of the growing cult of [[Santa Muerte]] regularly use marijuana smoke in purification ceremonies, with marijuana often taking the place of incense used in mainstream Catholic rituals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ktsm.com/news/only-9-the-dark-religion-santa-muerte |title=Only on 9: The Dark Religion of the Santa Muerte &amp;#124; KTSM News Channel 9 |publisher=Ktsm.com |date=2009-03-26 |accessdate=2011-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7853">The term '''childbirth positions''' (or "maternal birthing position")&lt;ref name="pmid2332746"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Olson R, Olson C, Cox NS |title=Maternal birthing positions and perineal injury |journal=J Fam Pract |volume=30 |issue=5 |pages=553–7 |date=May 1990 |pmid=2332746 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to the physical [[human positions|postures]] the pregnant mother may assume during the process of [[childbirth]]. They may also be referred to as delivery positions or labor positions.

In addition to the [[lithotomy position]], still commonly used by many [[obstetricians]], other positions are successfully used by [[midwives]] and traditional birth-attendants around the world. [[George Julius Engelmann|Engelmann's]] seminal work "Labor among primitive peoples" publicised the childbirth positions amongst primitive cultures to the Western world. They frequently use [[Squatting position|squatting]], [[standing]], [[kneeling]] and [[All fours (human position)|all fours]] positions, often in a sequence.&lt;ref&gt;Engelmann GJ Labor among primitive peoples (1883)&lt;/ref&gt; They are referred to as upright birth positions&lt;ref&gt;Non-Supine (e.g., Upright or Side-Lying) Positions for Birth. Lamaze International Education Council, Keen R, DiFranco J, Amis D, Albers L, Journal of Perinatal Education. 2004 spring; 13(2): 30–34.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Upright birth positions in general==
Various people have promoted the adoption of upright birthing positions, particularly squatting, for Western countries, such as [[Grantly Dick-Read]], [[Janet Balaskas]], [[Moysés Paciornik]] and [[Hugo Sabatino]]. The adoption of the non-lithotomy positions is also promoted by the [[natural childbirth]] movement.

Being upright during labour and birth can increase the available space within the pelvis by 28-30% giving more room to the baby for rotation and descent. There is also a 54% decreased incidence of foetal heart rate abnormalities when the mother is upright.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD002006.pub3 | title=Position in the second stage of labour for women without epidural anaesthesia | year=2012 | journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | author=Gupta JK}}&lt;/ref&gt; These birthing positions can also reduce the duration of the second stage of labour&lt;ref&gt;[http://apps.who.int/rhl/pregnancy_childbirth/childbirth/2nd_stage/tlacom/en/ Position in the second stage of labour for women without epidural anaesthesia: RHL commentary.] Lavender T and Mlay R.

==Squatting position==
[[File:Pre-Columbian collection, Dumbarton OaksDSCF7954.JPG|thumb|upright=0.8|The [[Dumbarton Oaks birthing figure]]]]The squatting position gives a greater increase of pressure in the pelvic cavity with minimal muscular effort. The birth canal will open 20 to 30% more in a squat than in any other position. It is recommended for the [[Second stage of labor|second stage of childbirth]].&lt;ref name=Russell&gt;Russell JG. Moulding of the pelvic outlet. J Obstet Gynaecol Br Commonw 1969;76:817-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

As most Western adults find it difficult to squat with heels down, compromises are often made such as putting a support under the elevated heels or another person supporting the squatter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://activebirth.org/Pages2/PAGES2PDFs/bbd13art6.pdf |title=Balaskas J Using the squatting position during labour and for birth |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-11-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309045503/http://activebirth.org/Pages2/PAGES2PDFs/bbd13art6.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[ancient Egypt]], women delivered babies while squatting on a pair of [[brick]]s, known as ''birth bricks''.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson"&gt;{{cite book |author=Wilkinson, Richard H. |title=The complete gods and goddesses of ancient Egypt |publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson |location=London |year=2003 |pages=152–153 |isbn=0-500-05120-8 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==All-fours==
Some mothers may choose the all-fours position instinctively. It can help the baby turn around in the case of a malpresentation of the head. Since this position uses gravity, it decreases back pain,&lt;ref name="childbirthsolutions.com"/&gt; as the mother is able to tilt her hips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.womenshealthmatters.ca/centres/pregnancy/childbirth/positions.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110109041945/http://www.womenshealthmatters.ca/centres/pregnancy/childbirth/positions.html |archivedate=2011-01-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Side lying==
Side lying may help slow the baby's descent down the birth canal, thereby giving the perineum more time to naturally stretch. To assume this position, the mother lies on her side with her knees bent. To push, a slight rolling movement is used such that the mother is propped up on one elbow is needed, while one leg is held up. This position does not use gravity but still holds an advantage over the lithotomy position, as it does not position the vena cava under the uterus, which decreases blood flow to mother and child.&lt;ref name="childbirthsolutions.com"/&gt;

== Lithotomy position ==
{{main|Lithotomy position}}
In the lithotomy position, the mother is lying on her back with her legs up in stirrups and her buttocks close to the edge of the table.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birthingnaturally.net/barp/lithotomy.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101025223022/http://birthingnaturally.net/barp/lithotomy.html |archivedate=2010-10-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This position is convenient for the caregiver because it permits him or her more access to the [[perineum]]. However, this is not a comfortable position for most patients, considering the pressure on the vaginal walls because the baby's head is uneven and the labor process is working against gravity.&lt;ref name="childbirthsolutions.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.childbirthsolutions.com/articles/birth/pushingpositions/index.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101024033917/http://www.childbirthsolutions.com/articles/birth/pushingpositions/index.php |archivedate=2010-10-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28560">'''Cuban medical internationalism''' is the [[Cuba]]n programme, since the 1959 [[Cuban Revolution]], of sending Cuban medical personnel overseas, particularly to [[Latin America]], [[Africa]] and, more recently, [[Cuban-Pacific relations#Cuban medical aid|Oceania]],&lt;ref name="plenglish.com"&gt;[http://www.plenglish.com:80/article.asp?ID=%7B771AA7E5-B9F3-4129-AFF7-208C0DC1D65D%7D)&amp;language=EN "Cuban Physicians to Aid 81 Nations"]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, [[Prensa Latina]], March 29, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and of bringing medical students and patients to Cuba. In 2007, "Cuba has 42,000 workers in international collaborations in 103 different countries, of whom more than 30,000 are health personnel, including no fewer than 19,000 physicians."&lt;ref name=HuishKirk07/&gt; Cuba provides more medical personnel to the developing world than all the [[G8]] countries combined,&lt;ref name=HuishKirk07/&gt; although this comparison does not take into account G8 [[development aid]] spent on developing world healthcare.

==Missions abroad==
[[File:ASC Leiden - Coutinho Collection - A 20 - Surgery in Sara, Guinea-Bissau - Operation details - 1974.tif|thumb|A Cuban surgeon with scrub cap performing an open air operation in Guinea-Bissau for the [[PAIGC]] liberation movement, 1974]]
In 2007, one academic study on Cuban internationalism surveyed the history of the programme, noting its broad sweep: "Since the early 1960s, 28,422 Cuban health workers have worked in 37 Latin American countries, 31,181 in 33 African countries, and 7,986 in 24 Asian countries. Throughout a period of four decades, Cuba sent 67,000 health workers to structural cooperation programs, usually for at least two years, in 94 countries ... an average of 3,350 health workers working abroad every year between 1960 and 2000."&lt;ref name=devos07/&gt;

===Anti-colonialism===
[[File:ASC Leiden - Coutinho Collection - 19 03 - Sara Infirmary - Consultation by a Cuban doctor - 1974.tif|alt=Light skinned Latin American doctor with scrub cap in Guinea Bassau amongst four black skinned natives.|thumb|A Cuban Doctor in Guinea-Bissau in 1974.]]
The programme was initiated in 1963 as part of Cuba's foreign policy of supporting [[anti-colonialism|anti-colonial]] struggles. It began when Cuba sent a small medical brigade to [[Algeria]], which suffered from the mass withdrawal of French medical personnel during the independence war; some wounded soldiers and war orphans were also transported back to Cuba for treatment.&lt;ref name="brouwer09"&gt;{{cite magazine | url=http://www.monthlyreview.org/090112brouwer.php | title=The Cuban Revolutionary Doctor: The Ultimate Weapon of Solidarity | first=Steve | last=Brouwer | date=January 2009 | work=[[Monthly Review]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Gleijeses |first= Piero |authorlink= Piero Gleijeses |year= 1996 |title= Cuba's First Venture in Africa: Algeria, 1961-1965 |journal= [[Journal of Latin American Studies]] |volume= 28 |issue= 1 |pages= 159–195 |jstor= 157991 |quote= The Minister of Public Health, Jose Ramón Machado Ventura, led the group, which included 29 doctors, three dentists, 15 nurses and eight medical technicians.

With the arrival of this medical mission in Algeria on 24 May 1963, Cuba's technical assistance abroad began. |doi=10.1017/s0022216x00012670}} (Quote is from p.&amp;nbsp;165).&lt;/ref&gt; Cuba did this at a time when, following the Cuban revolution, "half of the country’s 6,000 doctors fled".&lt;ref name="HuishKirk07" /&gt; Between 1966 and 1974, Cuban doctors worked alongside Cuban [[artillery]] in [[Guinea-Bissau]] during its independence war against Portugal.&lt;ref name="HuishKirk07" /&gt; Cuba's largest foreign campaign was in [[Angola]]: within two years of the campaign, by 1977, "only one Angolan province out of sixteen was without Cuban health technicians."&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Sylvester, 1994. “Cuba and the liberation of Southern Africa.” ''Monthly Review'' 46 (September): 17–25.&lt;/ref&gt; After 1979, Cuba developed a strong relationship with [[Nicaragua]].&lt;ref&gt;Schwab, T., Sims, H.D. (1985), "Cuba and Nicaragua: a key regional relationship, 1979-1984." ''Cuban Studies'' 15 (2), pp. 73-81&lt;/ref&gt;

===Humanitarianism===
However, alongside internationalism driven by foreign policy objectives, humanitarian objectives also played a role, with medical teams despatched to countries governed by ideological foes. For example, in 1960, 1972 and 1990 it dispatched emergency assistance teams to Chile and Nicaragua, and Iran following earthquakes.&lt;ref name=HuishKirk07/&gt; Similarly, Venezuela's [[Mission Barrio Adentro]] programme grew out of the emergency assistance provided by Cuban doctors in the wake of the December 1999 mudslides in Vargas state, which killed 20,000 people.&lt;ref name=briggsAJPH09&gt;Briggs, Charles, and Mantini-Briggs, Clara (2009), ''American Journal of Public Health'', "Confronting Health Disparities: Latin American Social Medicine in Venezuela", I(3)&lt;/ref&gt;

Cuban medical missions were sent to [[Honduras]], [[Guatemala]] and [[Haiti]] following 1998's [[Hurricane Mitch]] and [[Hurricane Georges]], and remained there semi-permanently.&lt;ref name=brouwer09/&gt; This has been part of a dramatic expansion of Cuba’s international cooperation in health since 1998.&lt;ref name=devos08&gt;De Vos et al (2008), "Cuba's health system: Challenges ahead", ''Health Policy and Planning'', 23(4), pg:288-290&lt;/ref&gt; The number of Cuban doctors working abroad jumped from about 5000 in 2003 to more than 25,000 in 2005.&lt;ref name=devos08/&gt;

In Honduras the medical personnel had a substantial impact: "In the areas they served, infant mortality rates were reduced from 30.8 to 10.1 per 1,000 live births and maternal mortality rates from 48.1 to 22.4 per 1,000 live births between 1998 and 2003."&lt;ref name=HuishKirk07/&gt; However, as one academic paper notes, "The idea of a nation saving lives and improving the human condition is alien to traditional statecraft and is therefore discounted as a rationale for the Cuban approach."&lt;ref name=HuishKirk07/&gt; In 2004 the 1700 medical personnel in [[Guatemala]] received the [[Order of the Quetzal]], the country's highest state honour.&lt;ref name=HuishKirk07/&gt; A 2005 attempt by Honduras to expel the Cuban mission on the basis that it was threatening Honduran jobs was successfully resisted by trade unions and community organisations.&lt;ref name=brouwer09/&gt;

Following the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake|2004 Asian tsunami]], Cuba sent medical assistance to [[Banda Aceh]] and [[Sri Lanka]].&lt;ref name=devos07&gt;De Vos et al (2007), "Cuba's International Cooperation in Health: an Overview", ''International Journal of Health Services'', Volume 37, Number 4, Pages 761–776&lt;/ref&gt; In response to [[Hurricane Katrina]], Cuba prepared to send 1500 doctors to the [[New Orleans]]; the offer was refused. Several months later the mission was dispatched to [[Pakistan]] following the [[2005 Kashmir earthquake]] there. Ultimately Cuba sent "more than 2,500 disaster response experts, surgeons, family doctors, and other health personnel", who stayed through the winter for more than 6 months.&lt;ref name=devos07/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Akhtar, A.S. (2006). "Cuban doctors in Pakistan: Why Cuba still inspires". ''Monthly Review'' 58 (6), pp. 49-55&lt;/ref&gt; Cuba is helping with the medical crisis in Haiti due to the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.portalangop.co.ao/motix/en_us/noticias/saude/2010/0/3/Cuba-grants-medical-aid-Haitian-earthquake-victims,a1293e93-e022-4af7-ac52-a49bdf9e635b.html|title=Cuba grants medical aid to Haitian earthquake victims|date=18 January 2010|publisher=Agencia Angola Press|accessdate=19 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; All 152 Cuban medical and educational personnel in the Haitian capital [[Port-au-Prince]] at the time of the earthquake were reported to be safe, with two suffering minor injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.havanatimes.org/?p=18130|title=Cuba Reacts to Haiti Earthquake |last=Robinson|first=Circles |date=January 14, 2010|publisher=Havana Times|accessdate=19 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Cuba sent 103 nurses and 62 doctors to help fight the [[Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa]], the biggest contribution of health care staff by any single country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last = Kupferschmidt |first = Kai |date = 12 September 2014 |title = Cuba to commit large health corps to Ebola fight |url = http://news.sciencemag.org/africa/2014/09/cuba-commit-large-health-corps-ebola-fight |website = [[Science (journal)|news.sciencemag.org]] |accessdate = 15 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Venezuela===
{{main|Mission Barrio Adentro}}
Cuba's largest and most extensive medical aid effort is with [[Venezuela]]. The [[Mission Barrio Adentro|program]] grew out of the emergency assistance provided by Cuban doctors in the wake of the December 1999 mudslides in Vargas state, which killed 20,000 people. Under this bilateral effort, also known as the "oil for doctors" program, Cuba provides Venezuela with 31,000 Cuban doctors and dentists and provides training for 40,000 Venezuelan medical personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rodriguez|first=Andrea|date=26 December 2016|title=Cuban President Raul Castro faces deep problems in 2017|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/a66f93b0a0df447dbbc5c7bb143d5b42/cuban-president-raul-castro-faces-deep-problems-2017|website=bigstory.ap.org|publisher=Associated Press|access-date=26 December 2016|quote=Venezuela was the prime destination alongside Brazil for Cuban doctors and other professionals whose salaries go directly to the Cuban government, providing another vital source of hard currency believed to be slackening in recent years.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In exchange, Venezuela provides Cuba with 100,000 barrels of oil per day. Based on February 2010 prices, the oil is worth $7.5 million per day, or nearly $3 billion per year.&lt;ref&gt;''Foreign Affairs'', July/August 2010. page 69&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other countries===
Cuba has also sent notable missions to Bolivia (particularly since the 2005 election of [[Evo Morales]]) and [[South Africa]], the latter in particular after a post-[[apartheid]] [[brain drain]] of white doctors.&lt;ref name=feinsilver08&gt;Julie M. Feinsilver (2008), [http://www.nuso.org/upload/articulos/3537_2.pdf "Oil-for-Doctors: Cuban Medical Diplomacy Gets a Little Help From a Venezuelan Friend"], ''Nueva Sociedad'' 216 July–August 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1995, a co-operation agreement with South Africa has seen hundreds of Cuban doctors practice in South Africa, while South Africa sends medical students to Cuba to study.&lt;ref name="bday"&gt;[http://www.businessday.co.za/articles/Content.aspx?id=172709 "Cuba, SA health deal is in good shape"]. ''Business Day'' (28 May 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the two governments signed another deal, increasing numbers on both sides. South African can now send 1 000 students to Cuba for training which, South Africa believes, will help train the doctors it so desperately needs for the implementation of its National Health Insurance Scheme.&lt;ref name="bday12"&gt;[http://www.businessday.co.za/articles/Content.aspx?id=172709 "SA signs deal with Cuba for more doctors"]. ''Business Day'' (28 May 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; After the 1999 violence in [[East Timor]], the country of a million people was left with only 35 physicians and 75% of its population displaced. The number later increased to 79 physicians by 2004, and Cuba sent an additional 182 physicians and technicians.&lt;ref name=huishspiegel08&gt;Robert Huish and Jerry Spiegel (2008), "INTEGRATING HEALTH AND HUMAN SECURITY INTO FOREIGN POLICY: CUBA’S SURPRISING SUCCESS", ''The International Journal of Cuban Studies'' Volume 1 Issue 1, June 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

"From 1963 to 2004, Cuba was involved in the creation of nine medical faculties in Yemen, Guyana, Ethiopia, Guinea-Bissau, Uganda, Ghana, Gambia, Equatorial Guinea, and Haiti."&lt;ref name=devos07/&gt;

====Oceania====
In the 2000s, Cuba began establishing or strengthening relations with [[Pacific Island]] countries, and providing medical aid to those countries. Cuba's medical aid to Pacific countries has been two-pronged, consisting in sending doctors to Oceania, and in providing scholarships for Pacific students to study medicine in Cuba at Cuba's expense.

There are currently sixteen doctors providing specialised medical care in [[Kiribati]], with sixteen more scheduled to join them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pacificmagazine.net/news/2007/10/01/six-more-cuban-physicians-to-serve-in-kiribati Pacific Magazine: Six More Cuban Physicians To Serve In Kiribati&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cubans have also offered training to I-Kiribati doctors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&amp;id=26617 Kiribati discusses medical training with Cuba&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Cuban doctors have reportedly provided a dramatic improvement to the field of medical care in Kiribati, reducing the child mortality rate in that country by 80%,&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;[http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&amp;id=33793 Cuban doctors reduce Kiribati infant mortality rate by 80 percent&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and winning the proverbial hearts and minds in the Pacific. In response, the [[Solomon Islands]] began recruiting Cuban doctors in July 2007, while [[Papua New Guinea]] and [[Fiji]] considered following suit.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt;

In 2008, Cuba was due to send doctors to the Solomon Islands, [[Vanuatu]], [[Tuvalu]], [[Nauru]] and Papua New Guinea,&lt;ref name="plenglish.com"/&gt; while seventeen medical students from Vanuatu would study in Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&amp;id=41373 "Vanuatu to get six doctors from Cuba"], Radio New Zealand International, August 10, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported that it might also provide training for Fiji doctors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&amp;id=38964 "Fiji says Cuban help sought as neighbours turn away"], Radio New Zealand International, April 4, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

As of September 2008, fifteen Cuban doctors were serving in Kiribati, sixty-four Pacific students were studying medicine in Cuba, and Cuban authorities were offering "up to 400 scholarships to young people of that region".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cubanews.ain.cu/2008/0916amistadislaspacifico.htm "Cuban Foreign Minister Opens Cuba-Pacific Islands Meeting"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20090614213049/http://www.cubanews.ain.cu/2008/0916amistadislaspacifico.htm |date=2009-06-14 }}, Cuban News Agency, September 16, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Among those sixty-four students were twenty-five Solomon Islanders, twenty I-Kiribati, two Nauruans and seventeen ni-Vanuatu.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cubanews.ain.cu/2008/0929especialnusa.htm "Small Island States and Global Challenges"], Cuban News Agency, September 30, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Pacific Islanders have been studying in Cuba since 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/news/stories/200809/s2366887.htm?tab=latest "Cuba-Pacific ministerial meeting underway in Havana"], ABC Radio Australia, September 17, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2009, [[Prensa Latina]] reported that Cuban doctors had "inaugurated a series of new health services in Tuvalu". One Cuban doctor had been serving in Tuvalu since October 2008, and two more since February 2009. They had reportedly "attended 3,496 patients, and saved 53 lives", having "opened ultrasound and abortion services, as well as specialized consultations on hypertension, diabetes, and chronic diseases in children". They had visited all the country's islands, and were training local staff in "primary health care, and how to deal with seriously ill patients, among other subjects".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cubaheadlines.com/2009/06/14/17664/cuban_doctors_have_inaugurated_a_series_new_health_services_tuvalu_a_small_island_nation_pacific.html "Cuban doctors have inaugurated a series of new health services in Tuvalu a small island nation in the Pacific"], Prensa Latina, June 14, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Principles===
Missions abroad are intended to provide services at low cost to the host country. "Patients are not charged for services, and the recipient countries are expected to cover only the cost of collective housing, air fare, and limited food and supplies not exceeding $200 a month. While
Cuban doctors are abroad, they continue to receive their salaries as well as a stipend in foreign currency."&lt;ref name=HuishKirk07/&gt; In 2008, the pay for Cuban doctors abroad was 183$ per month, whereas the pay for doctors working domestically was 23$ per month.&lt;ref name=feinsilver08/&gt; 
A new term - "disaster tourism" - has arisen in response to a growing number of large-scale natural disasters.  This phrase refers to individuals, governments and organizations who travel to a disaster area with the primary goal of having an "experience" rather than providing meaningful aid.  Such aid is often short-lived, and may even get in the way of more serious rescue efforts.  Cuban medical internationalism represents a polar opposite to this disaster tourism mentality, with a focus on large-scale, sustained aid targeting the most marginalized and under-served populations across the globe. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kirk|first1=John|title=Healthcare Without Borders: Understanding Cuban Medical Internationalism|date=2015|publisher=University Press of Florida|location=Gainesville, FL|isbn=9780813061054|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internationalism at home==
Since 1990, Cuba has provided long-term care for 18,000 victims of the [[Chernobyl disaster]], "offering treatment for hair loss, skin disorders, cancer, leukemia, and other illnesses attributed to radioactivity."&lt;ref name=HuishKirk07/&gt;

In response to the 1998 [[Hurricane Mitch]], Cuba set up the "Escuela Latinoamericana de Medicina" ("[[Latin American School of Medicine (Cuba)|Latin American School of Medicine]]"; ELAM) outside Havana, converted from a former naval base. It accepts around 1500 students per year.&lt;ref name=HuishKirk07&gt;Robert Huish and John M. Kirk (2007), "Cuban Medical Internationalism and the Development of the Latin American School of Medicine", ''Latin American Perspectives'', 34; 77&lt;/ref&gt; ELAM forms part of a range of medical education and training initiatives; "Cubans, with the help of Venezuela, are currently educating more doctors, about 70,000 in all, than all the medical schools in the United States, which typically have somewhere between 64,000 to 68,000 students enrolled in their programs."&lt;ref name=brouwer09/&gt;

Following the development of cooperation with Venezuela through Mission Barrio Adentro, Mission Milagro / Operación Milagro was set up to provide [[ophthalmology]] services to Cuban, Venezuelan and Latin American patients, both in Cuba and in other countries. "As of August 2007, Cuba had performed over 750,000 eye surgeries, at no cost, including 113,000 surgeries for its own citizens."&lt;ref name=HuishKirk07/&gt;

==Effects on Cuba==

===Benefits===
Although humanitarian principles figure, ideological factors were prominent in Cuba's "doctor diplomacy", particularly during the [[Cold War]]. Subsequently, its continuation has been seen as a vital means to promote Cuba's image abroad and prevent international isolation. For Cuba's re-establishment of diplomatic relations with Honduras in 2002, Cuba's health missions in that country were "undoubtedly a deciding factor";&lt;ref name=HuishKirk07/&gt; Guatemala reestablished diplomatic relations with Cuba in 1998.&lt;ref name=devos07/&gt;

At the 2009 [[5th Summit of the Americas]], U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] commented that at the summit he had heard much about the impact of Cuban "soft diplomacy" in the form of its medical internationalism. He said this might be a reminder to the [[United States]] that limiting its interactions with Latin American countries to military and drug interdiction might be limiting its influence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.venezuelanalysis.com/news/4376 "Chavez-Obama Meeting at Summit Relaunches U.S.-Venezuela Relations"] (20 April 2009). venezuelanalysis.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been suggested that Cuban medical internationalism promotes exports of Cuban medical technology, and may be a source of hard currency (although the targeting of poor countries reduces the hard currency potential of missions abroad).&lt;ref name=HuishKirk07/&gt; In 2006 Cuba's earnings from medical services (including export of doctors) amounted to US$2,312m – 28% of total export receipts and net capital payments. This exceeded earnings from both nickel and cobalt exports and from tourism.&lt;ref name=feinsilver08/&gt; These earnings are achieved despite the fact that a substantial part of Cuba's medical internationalism since 1998 has been organised within the framework of the "Integrated Health Program" (Programa Integral de Salud, PIS); this cooperation program is free for the receiving country.&lt;ref name=devos07/&gt; Cuba's co-operation with Venezuela provides Cuba with cheap oil in exchange for its medical support to Mission Barrio Adentro.&lt;ref name=devos07/&gt; Bloomberg reported in March 2014 that Cuban state-controlled media forecasted revenue of $8.2 million that year from the program.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Sabo, Bloomberg.com, Mar 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been argued that the programme has, particularly in the 1980s and 1990s, "perform[ed] a critical function in consolidating socialist consciousness" within Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;Saney, I. 2009, "Homeland of humanity: Internationalism within the Cuban revolution", ''Latin American Perspectives'' 36 (1), pp. 111-123&lt;/ref&gt;

===Costs===
Although Cuba's large-scale medical training programmes and high doctor-patient ratios give it much latitude, the expansion of doctor diplomacy since 2004, particularly with the Barrio Adentro programme, has been dramatic: the number of Cuban doctors working abroad jumped from about 5000 in 2003 to more than 25,000 in 2005.&lt;ref name=devos08/&gt; This has had some impact on the domestic health system, for example with increased waiting times, particularly with regard to family doctors.&lt;ref name=feinsilver08/&gt; The number of patients per doctor rose from 139 to 179.&lt;ref name=huishspiegel08/&gt; In March 2008 Cuba announced a reorganisation of its domestic family doctor programme for greater efficiency.&lt;ref name=feinsilver08/&gt;

====Defection====
In 2000, two Cuban doctors working in Zimbabwe attempted to defect to Canada. They were prevented from doing so by two Zimbabwean soldiers, who handed them over to Cuban officials.&lt;ref name="vanish"&gt;''Miami Herald'', 6 June 2000, [http://www.cubanet.org/htdocs/CNews/y00/jun00/06e4.htm Cuban doctors vanish in Zimbabwe]&lt;/ref&gt; United Nations officials said Zimbabwe appeared to have violated national and international laws.

In August 2006 the [[United States]] under [[George W. Bush]] created the Cuban Medical Professional Parole program,&lt;ref&gt;U.S. State Dept, [https://www.state.gov/p/wha/rls/fs/2009/115414.htm "Cuban Medical Professional Parole Program"], accessed 4 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; specifically targeting Cuban medical personnel and encouraging them to defect when they are working in a country outside of Cuba.&lt;ref name=brouwer09/&gt; Of an estimated 40,000 eligible medical personnel, over 1000 had entered the United States under the program by October 2007, according to the chief of staff for U.S. Rep. [[Lincoln Diaz-Balart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.coha.org/2007/10/hundreds-of-cuban-medical-workers-defecting-to-us-while-overseas/ | title=Hundreds of Cuban medical workers defecting to U.S. while overseas | first=Tal | last=Abbady | work=South Florida Sun-Sentinel | date=10 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The promised fast-track visa is not always forthcoming, with at least one applicant waiting a year for his visa; although according to Dr. Julio Cesar Alfonso of the Cuban dissident organization "Outside the Barrio," the U.S. government has rejected only a handful of the hundreds of applications for visas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/Article.aspx?id=981 | title=Cuban Doctors Abroad Helped to Defect by New U.S. Visa Policy | first=Mike | last=Ceasar | work=World Politics Review | date=August 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 January 2017, President [[Barack Obama|Obama]] announced the end of the program, saying that both Cuba and the US work to "combat diseases that endanger the health and lives of our people. By providing preferential treatment to Cuban medical personnel, the medical parole program contradicts those efforts, and risks harming the Cuban people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Whitefield|first1=Mimi|title=Obama ending ‘wet foot, dry foot’ Cuban immigration policy|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/cuba/article126202999.html|work=Miami Herald|date=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2007 paper published in ''[[The Lancet]]'' medical journal, "growing numbers of Cuban doctors sent overseas to work are defecting to the USA", some via Colombia, where they have sought temporary asylum.&lt;ref name="defect"/&gt; In February 2007, at least 38 doctors were requesting asylum in the U.S. embassy in Bogotá after asylum was denied by the Colombian government.&lt;ref&gt;''El Universal'' 3 Feb 2007 {{es icon}} [http://buscador.eluniversal.com/2007/02/03/pol_art_166219.shtml "Cubanos desertores atrapados en Bogotá"].&lt;/ref&gt; Cuban doctors working abroad are reported to be monitored by "minders" and subject to curfew.&lt;ref name="defect"&gt;Ceaser, Michael (2007). "Cuban doctors working abroad defect to the USA". ''The Lancet'', Volume 369, Issue 9569&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Luis Zuñiga, director of human rights for the [[Cuban American National Foundation]], Cuban doctors are "slave workers" who labor for meager wages while bolstering Cuba's image as a donor nation and "the Cuban government exports these doctors as merchandise".&lt;ref name="vanish"/&gt;

==Possible effects of lifting the U.S. embargo against Cuba==
An article by Laurie Garrett in ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' warns that lifting of the [[United States embargo against Cuba|United States trade and travel restrictions on Cuba]] could have dire consequences for Cuba's healthcare system, leading to an exodus of thousands of well-trained Cuban healthcare professionals. U.S. companies could also transform the remaining healthcare system into a destination for [[medical tourism]]. Garrett concludes that if politicians do not take great care, lifting of the restrictions would rob Cuba of its greatest triumph.&lt;ref&gt;''Foreign Affairs'', July/August 2010. page 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

Types of [[dance]] can entail body movements, expression and collaboration.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; '''Dance and health''' has been subject of a number of research studies that show [[dance]] to be a healthy [[exercise]]. However, there are a number of health risks that require attention&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[File:Folk dances.jpg|thumb|right|Dancing is a healthy exercise for all ages]]

==Benefits of dance==
===Physical health and fitness===
[[File:Ellsworth Zumba demo.JPG|thumb|Ellsworth Zumba demo.]]
Dancing can be a way to stay fit for people of all ages, shapes and sizes. It has a wide range of physical, and mental benefits including: improved condition of your [[heart]] and [[lung]]s, increased [[muscular strength]], [[endurance]] and motor fitness, increased aerobic fitness, improved [[muscle tone]] and [[Physical strength|strength]], weight management, stronger bones and reduced risk of [[osteoporosis]], better coordination, [[agility]] and flexibility, improved balance and spatial awareness, increased physical confidence, improved [[Mind|mental]] functioning, improved general and [[psychological]] well being, greater [[self-confidence]] and [[self-esteem]], and better social skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/healthyliving/dance-health-benefits|title=Dance - health benefits|first=Department of Health &amp; Human|last=Services|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Most forms of dance may be considered an [[aerobic exercise]] and as such reduce the risk of [[cardiovascular disease]], help [[weight control]], [[stress reduction]], and bring about other benefits commonly associated with [[physical fitness]]. In addition, studies have demonstrated a considerable correlation between dancing and psychological well-being. A large amount of governmental, health, and educational information is available extolling the benefits of dance for health.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/publication_archive/dance-and-health-the-benefits-for-people-of-all-ages/ Dance and health: The benefits for people of all ages.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160121061245/http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/publication_archive/dance-and-health-the-benefits-for-people-of-all-ages/ |date=21 January 2016 }} Jointly from the British National Health Service and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Benefits of Cultural dance'''
Physical activity has many physical and mental health outcomes. However, physical inactivity continues to be common. Dance, specifically cultural dance, is a type of physical activity that may appeal to some who are not otherwise active and may be a form of activity that is more acceptable than others in certain cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Olvera|first1=Anna E.|title=Cultural Dance and Health|journal=American Journal of Health Education|date=2008|volume=39|issue=6|pages=353–359|doi=10.1080/19325037.2008.10599062}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dance pad]]s have proven useful in tackling [[obesity]] in young people and are welcomed in many schools for that reason.&lt;ref&gt;[http://seriousgamessource.com/features/feature_051906.php Games on Deck] Games For Health 2006: Dance Dance… Revolution in Fitness!&lt;/ref&gt;

A report by Professor Tim Watson and Dr Andrew Garrett of the [[University of Hertfordshire]] compared members of the [[Royal Ballet]] with a squad of British national and international swimmers. The dancers scored higher than the swimmers in seven out of ten areas of fitness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/10/081022073916.htm|title=Ballet Dancers Are Fitter Than International Swimmers, Study Finds|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An Italian study in 2006 has shown that dance is a very good exercise for heart patients compared to other [[aerobic exercise]]s like [[cycling]]. This may be partly because the patients enjoyed it much more.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=3043386 America Heart Association] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090716153210/http://www.heart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=3043386 |date=16 July 2009 }} Heart failure patients can waltz their way to healthier hearts&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081011152348/http://www.healthsystem.virginia.edu/UVAHealth/news_heartcare/0702hc.cfm Heart Care -February 2007] Waltzing Your Way to a Stronger Heart&lt;/ref&gt;

A study at the [[Washington University in St. Louis]] School of Medicine in 2007 showed [[Argentine tango]] was better at improving the mobility of [[Parkinson's disease]] sufferers than an exercise class&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hackney|first1=Madeleine E.|last2=Kantorovich|first2=Svetlana|last3=Earhart|first3=Gammon M.|title=A Study on the Effects of Argentine Tango as a Form of Partnered Dance for those with Parkinson Disease and the Healthy Elderly|journal=American Journal of Dance Therapy|date=2007|volume=29|issue=2|pages=109–127|doi=10.1007/s10465-007-9039-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; (a later study showed similar benefits from Tai chi).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hackney|first1=Madeleine E.|last2=Earhart|first2=Gammon M.|title=Tai Chi improves balance and mobility in people with Parkinson disease|journal=Gait &amp; Posture|date=2008|volume=28|issue=3|pages=456–460|doi=10.1016/j.gaitpost.2008.02.005|pmc=2552999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the level of interest a permanent tango class was set up after the study ended. A study by Dr Paul Dougall at [[University of Strathclyde|Strathclyde University]] in 2010 concentrating on older women found that [[Scottish country dance]]rs were more agile, have stronger legs and can walk more briskly than people of the same age who took part in exercises such as swimming, walking, golf and keep-fit classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Another gain of dancing is for those who have high cholesterol, plus drugs and adequate food, dancing can draw. As an [[aerobic exercise]] abridged levels of total blood cholesterol, especially in [[LDL cholesterol]], acknowledged as bad and helps boost levels of HDL or good [[cholesterol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://whatisusa.info/10-benefits-of-dance-for-health/|title=Ten biggest benefits of dancing|publisher=What is USA News|date=28 March 2014 | accessdate=2013-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dancing in general increases, muscle strength and flexibility, which in turn, improves overall range of motion. Dance also increases core strength which can improve balance, coordination, and posture (which reduces back pain).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ward|first1=Sheila A.|title=Health and the Power of Dance|journal=Journal of Physical Education, Recreation &amp; Dance|date=2008|volume=79|issue=4|pages=33–36|doi=10.1080/07303084.2008.10598161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mental health===
Dance has been repeatedly shown to positively impact a person's [[mental health]]. For example, lead study author Anna Duberg, of Sweden's Center for Health Care Sciences, found that, "despite problems such as stress and other potential challenges in being an adolescent girl, dance can result in high adherence and a positive experience for the participants." Dancing had the potential to contribute to new healthy habits. Swedish researchers, writing in the JAMA Pediatrics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Duberg A |author2=Hagberg L |author3=Sunvisson H |author4=Möller M |title=Influencing Self-rated Health Among Adolescent Girls With Dance Intervention |url=http://archpedi.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1390784 |journal=JAMA Pediatrics |date=2013 |issn= |pages=27–31 |volume=167 |issue=1 |doi=10.1001/jamapediatrics.2013.421}}&lt;/ref&gt; studied 112 teenage girls who were struggling with problems including neck and back pain, stress, [[anxiety]], and depression. Half of the girls attended weekly dance classes, while the other half didn't. The girls who took the dance classes improved their mental health and reported a boost in mood—positive effects that lasted up to eight months after the classes ended.

Additionally, a recent study done in Perth Western Australia by Debbie Duignan (WA Alzheimers Association) explored the use of Wu Tao Dance as a therapy for people with dementia. It was shown that Wu Tao dance helped to reduce symptoms of agitation in people with dementia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nursingtimes.net/nursing-practice-clinical-research/specialists/older-people/exploring-dance-as-a-therapy-for-symptoms-and-social-interaction-in-a-dementia-care-unit/5004646.article |title=Exploring dance as a therapy for symptoms and social interaction in a dementia care unit |date=30 July 2009 |publisher=nursingtimes.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complex mental coordination involved with dancing activates both sensory and motor circuits. Therefore, when one dances, one's brain is both stimulated by the sound of the music and by the dance movements themselves. PET imaging has shown brain regions that become activated during dance learning and performance, including the motor cortex, somatosensory cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://neuro.hms.harvard.edu/harvard-mahoney-neuroscience-institute/brain-newsletter/and-brain-series/dancing-and-brain|title=Dancing and the Brain - Department of Neurobiology|website=neuro.hms.harvard.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The benefits of dancing on the brain includes memory improvement and strengthened neural connections. Consequently, not only can dance help to reduce symptoms experienced by those with dementia, but it can also reduce the risk of developing dementia in the first place, as shown in a 2003 study in the ''New England Journal of Medicine'' by researchers at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine.

In addition to improving symptoms of dementia and preventing dementia, frequent dancing can even lead to increased cognitive acuity for individuals of all ages. However, not all kinds of dancing have this power. Those dance styles that allow for the most split-second decisions are the most beneficial; those dance styles with the same, memorized patterns are the least beneficial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://socialdance.stanford.edu/syllabi/smarter.htm|title=Dancing Makes You Smarter|website=socialdance.stanford.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the same reason, those who take the Follow role have a higher opportunity for improving their cognitive acuity since they must make constant split-second decisions as they follow their partner’s lead. The key for improving cognitive acuity is to create new neural connections to increase the complexity of our neuronal synapses. Another important consideration is that the frequency of dancing matters. The more frequent an individual dances, the greater the cognitive improvement.

Furthermore, many cultures agree that there is a mind and body connection, and many cultures use dance to heal this often damaged connection. During the African diaspora, individuals used dance therapy to treat the trauma that resided from their situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Monteiro|first1=Nicole M.|last2=Wall|first2=Diana J.|title=African Dance as Healing Modality Throughout the Diaspora: The Use of Ritual and Movement to Work Through Trauma|journal=The Journal of Pan African Studies|date=2011|volume=4|issue=6|pages=234–252|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nicole_Monteiro/publication/251237748_African_Dance_as_Healing_Modality_Throughout_the_Diaspora_The_Use_of_Ritual_and_Movement_to_Work_Through_Trauma/links/00b7d51efab8e450a4000000.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dance therapy is suggested for patients today as treatment for emotional and therapeutic support, as dance allows individuals to connect with their inner-self.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatmentsandsideeffects/complementaryandalternativemedicine/mindbodyandspirit/dance-therapy|title=Complementary and Alternative Medicine - American Cancer Society|website=www.cancer.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risks of dance==
There are various health risks of professional dance, as it can be very demanding. As well as [[sports injuries]], [[repetitive strain injury]], and chronic [[workplace stress]]. Dancers risk injury within the course of their career, many retiring from active performance in their mid to late 30s. Since dance is a [[performance art]] with emphasis on [[aesthetics]], dancers are also at a higher risk of [[body image]] problems and [[eating disorders]] such as [[anorexia nervosa]] or [[bulimia]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; 
Some dances, such as ballet, are very strenuous on the body. Research shows that dancers in elite pre-professional companies have 1.38 injuries per 1000 hours of dancing, with dancers averaging about 30.3 hours per week. The most common injury was to the lower extremities, with ankle being the most common. The injuries on average took about 7 days to heal with foot injuries taking the longest at 14 days and thigh injuries being the lowest at 2 days.&lt;ref name="search.proquest.com"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ekegren|first1=Christina L.|last2=Quested|first2=Rachele|last3=Brodrick|first3=Anna|title=Injuries in pre-professional ballet dancers: Incidence, characteristics and consequences|journal=Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport|date=2014|volume=17|issue=3|pages=271–275|doi=10.1016/j.jsams.2013.07.013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another risk dancers face are eating disorders.  They are constantly judged based on their looks and expected to have toned, slim bodies.  This can lead to a lot of health risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://au-di-tions.com/anorexia-and-dance-looking-for-the-perfect-body-in-dance/|title=Anorexia and Dance.

Many dance [[Movement (music)|movements]], and particularly [[ballet technique]]s, such as the [[Turnout (ballet)|turnout]] of the hips and rising on the toes ([[en pointe]]), test the limits of the range of movement of the human body. Dance movements can place stress on the body when not performed correctly; even if perfect form is used, over-repetition can cause [[repetitive strain injury]]. The most common injury for ballet dancers is snapping hip syndrome &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dance-teacher.com/2010/08/10-common-dance-injuries/|title=How to Prevent These 10 Common Dance Injuries|date=2 January 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shoulder injuries can be common in dancers due to lifting, partnering and floor work that is commonly seen in modern dance. The periscapular muscles assist in keeping the shoulder still and steady, these muscles are at greater risk for injuries among dancers.&lt;ref&gt;Kotraba, Robert. “Shoulder Injuries in Dancers.” Recovery Physical Therapy, Recovery Physical Therapy, 22 June 2014, www.recoverypt.com/shoulder-injuries-in-dancers/.

Examined in the ''Journal of Dance Medicine and Science'', dancers often put off consultation from doctors or physical therapists in the effort to stay employed by a dance company or to stay in rehearsals. When in fact those dancers that "work through" their pain more often than not end up worsening their symptoms and prolonging their recovery. Eighty percent of professional dancers will be injured in some way during their careers; 50 percent of dancers from large ballet companies and 40 percent from small companies will miss performances due to injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Machleder |first=Elaine |year=2000 |url=http://www.dancespirit.com/backissues/jul_aug00/avoidinjury.shtml |title=Avoiding Injury: It's A Science |publisher=Dance Spirit Magazine |accessdate=2006-05-23 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060319092055/http://www.dancespirit.com/backissues/jul_aug00/avoidinjury.shtml |archivedate=19 March 2006 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of "[[Plié|plie]]ing" (bending one's knees deeply) after landing each jump may seem innocuous, but failing to do so may result in [[shin splints]] or knee injuries.

Overwork and poor [[occupational health and safety]] conditions, a (non-[[sprung floor|sprung]]) hard floor, a cold studio or theater, or dancing without sufficient [[warm up]] also increase risk of injury. To minimize injury, dance training emphasizes strength building and forming appropriate [[Habit (psychology)|habit]]s. Choreographers and dance instructors will often put certain demands on their students and dancers without taking into consideration that each dancer is faced with different anatomical limitations. Dancers will strive to achieve the ideal aesthetic in their respective dance technique by over compensating for their limitations and thus presenting themselves with a higher risk for injury. Also damage may result from having a student perform movements for which they are not prepared, care must be taken that the student is not "pushed" inappropriately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dance and health|url=http://pole-acrobatics.info/lexicon/dance-and-health.html|website=Pole-acrobatics.info|accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A dancer put [[pointe technique|en pointe]] at an age where his or her bones have not completely [[ossified]] may develop permanent damage; even past the point of ossification, ankle injuries can result if a dancer goes en pointe without sufficient strength. Rachele Quested and Anna Brodrick, the lower extremities are the vulnerable to injury. The most common injury is to the ankle, then leg, foot, knee, hip and finally the thigh. Dancers are trained from a very young age to avoid injury by using plie, turn out, and other means to protect their bodies.&lt;ref name="search.proquest.com"/&gt;

====Avoiding injury====

Keeping dancers free of injury is a crucial aspect and will help a lifetime of healthy [[Physical exercise|physical activity]] and can prevent injuries in the future. By being taught a few simple techniques by parents, teachers, and medical professionals can avert injuries from occurring. Following are a few advice's on preventing injuries.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stopsportsinjuries.org/STOP/Prevent_Injuries/STOP/Prevent_Injuries/Our_Resources.aspx?hkey=c0514bfe-e99a-43d7-88c9-7dd9f5756d61|title=STOP Sports Injuries|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wearing properly fitting clothing and shoes, drink plenty of fluids to stay hydrated, don’t dance through pain, rest and then start back up again and listen to your teachers for correct technique.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For social dance the use of a [[sprung floor]] is highly recommended.&lt;ref name="Harkness Centre for Dance Injuries"&gt;[http://www.med.nyu.edu/hjd/harkness/patients/injuries/ Harkness Centre for Dance Injuries] Common Dance Injuries  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128055503/http://www.med.nyu.edu/hjd/harkness/patients/injuries/ |date=28 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because a dance injury can ruin a career professional dancers are increasingly refusing to dance on anything else. In [[ballet]] good [[Plié|plie]]ing (bending the knees) on landing helps protect against [[knee]] injuries and [[shin splint]]s. Many types of dance, especially [[folk dances]], have hops in the steps where the impact of landing can be reduced by slightly bending the knee. [[Warming up]] and [[cooling down]] exercises are recommended before and after exercises to avoid strain, muscle pains, and possible injury.&lt;ref&gt;Adapted Physical Education and Sport By Joseph P.

====Treatment of injuries====
[[File:Treatment of Injuries.png|thumb|&lt;ref name="Types Of Dance"/&gt;]]
{{main|Sports injury}}
[[RICE (medicine)|RICE]] (Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation) is generally regarded as a good first aid therapy for most dance injuries before the ambulance comes, or even for what may be thought of as minor injuries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120708010505/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1083/is_4_79/ai_n13493419 Dance Magazine April, 2005 by Linda Hamilton] Ouch! Five common dance injuries &amp; how to treat them&lt;/ref&gt; Pain and inflammation can be reduced using a [[non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug]] (NSAID) in a gel applied to the affected area (not on broken skin). Note, however, that masking pain to continue dancing is dangerous as it can easily make an injury worse.&lt;ref name="Harkness Centre for Dance Injuries"/&gt;

===Stress===
Professional dancers may experience [[chronic stress|chronic]] [[workplace stress]] with an uncertain work situation. The average income for a ballet dancer is low,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.edonline.com/collegecompass/oohb0107.htm | title=Occupational Overview for Dancers and Choreographers | publisher=College Compass}}&lt;/ref&gt; and competition for jobs is very high. In addition to the stress that may be caused by this, dancers also may experience the psychological distress from technical and physical "[[Perfectionism (psychology)|perfectionism]]". As with other activities (such as [[jockey|horse jockeying]]) where weight is a factor, dancers are at a higher risk for developing eating disorders such as anorexia and bulimia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Maloney MJ |title=Anorexia nervosa and bulimia in dancers. Accurate diagnosis and treatment planning |journal=Clin Sports Med |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=549–55 |date=November 1983 |pmid=6580964 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many young dancers, believing that the ideal dancer must be thin, may begin controlling their diets, sometimes obsessively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1159/000066238 |vauthors=Bettle N, Bettle O, Neumärker U, Neumärker KJ |title=Adolescent ballet school students: their quest for body weight change |journal=Psychopathology |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=153–9 |year=1998 |pmid=9636944 |url=http://content.karger.com/produktedb/produkte.asp?typ=fulltext&amp;file=psp31153}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such dancers may be unaware of or may choose to ignore the fact that an [[emaciation|emaciated]] dancer will not have the strength required for ballet. It is also highly relevant that inadequate nutrition in adolescent females has been linked to development of scoliosis, due to decreased oestrogen production and subsequent reduced bone density. A dancer with poor nutrition is at a higher risk for injuries and long-term health problems. A malnourished dancer's performance will be altered and weaken as his or her body starts to break down muscle and bone in order to fuel itself. This puts the dancer at risk for injury and slows the healing of chronic injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dance|url=http://orthopedics.childrenscolorado.org/sports-medicine--injuries/sports-injuries-we-treat/dance|publisher=Children's Hospital of Colorado: Orthopedics Institute|accessdate=13 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a survey of 300 professional dancers, 40% were [[Tobacco smoking|tobacco smokers]] in contrast with the [[Center for Disease Control]] average of 24% of American women and 29% of American men aged 18–34.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.gsb.columbia.edu/faculty/NSicherman/Research/getpaper.cfm/Why.Do.Dancers.Smoke.pdf?Article=Why.Do.Dancers.Smoke.pdf |title=Why Do Dancers Smoke? |accessdate=2006-10-05 |authors=Lalith Munasinghe, Nachum Sicherman |date=February 2005 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307122721/http://www2.gsb.columbia.edu/faculty/NSicherman/Research/getpaper.cfm/Why.Do.Dancers.Smoke.pdf?Article=Why.Do.Dancers.Smoke.pdf |archivedate=7 March 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific study of dance==
[[Dance science]] is the scientific study of dance and dancers, as well as the practical application of scientific principles to dance. Its aims are the enhancement of performance, the reduction of injury, and the improvement of well-being and health. Dance requires a high degree of interpersonal and motor skills, and yet seems built into humans. It has therefore increasingly become the subject of [[neuroscience|neurological]] studies. The July 2008 edition of Scientific American contains a summary of recent studies and further questions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=the-neuroscience-of-dance] So You Think You Can Dance?: PET Scans Reveal Your Brain's Inner Choreography.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24323">'''Dry cleaning''' is any cleaning process for [[clothing]] and [[textile]]s using a chemical [[solvent]] other than [[water]]. It is used to clean fabrics that degrade in water, and delicate fabrics that cannot withstand the rough and tumble of a [[washing machine]] and [[clothes dryer]]. It can eliminate labor-intensive hand washing.

Despite its name, dry cleaning is not a "dry" process; clothes are soaked in a liquid solvent. [[Tetrachloroethylene]] (perchloroethylene), which the industry calls "perc",  is the most widely used solvent.  Alternative solvents are [[1,1,1-Trichloroethane|trichloroethane]] and petroleum spirits.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;David C. Tirsell "Dry Cleaning" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2000. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a09_049}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
On March 3, 1821, [[Thomas L. Jennings]] became the first African-American to be granted a [[United States]] [[patent]]. The patent was for his invention of a cleaning process called "dry scouring", which was the precursor to dry cleaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-113hres514ih/html/BILLS-113hres514ih.htm |title=U.S. Congress Resolution H. Res. 514 Honoring Thomas Jennings of New York City as the first African-American to be granted a patent by the United States |publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office |accessdate=2015-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first commercial "dry laundry" using turpentine was founded by Jolly Belin in Paris in 1825.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NzhUTvUkpDQC&amp;pg=PA883&amp;lpg=PA883&amp;dq=jolly+belin+dry+cleaning+paris&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=y_-hI12b1Y&amp;sig=7P87w_BYBmf3mRE3slI-180JT1s&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=jolly%2520belin%2520dry%2520cleaning%2520paris&amp;f=false | title=Handbook of Solvents |chapter=Dry Cleaning - Treatment of Textiles in Solvent |page=883 |publisher=ChemTec Publishing |year=2001 |first=Kaspar D |last=Hasenclever|editor-first=George |editor-last=Wypych}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern dry cleaning's use of non-water-based solvents to remove soil and stains from clothes was reported as early as 1855. The potential for [[petroleum]]-based solvents was recognized by French dye-works operator Jean Baptiste Jolly, who offered a new service that became known as ''nettoyage à sec''—i.e., dry cleaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/dry-cleaning1.htm|title=How Dry Cleaning Works|publisher=Science.howstuffworks.com|accessdate=2006-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jalingo.co/business/laundry-dry-cleaning-business|title=How To Start a Laundry / Dry Cleaning Business in Nigeria|publisher=Jalingo.co|access-date=2018-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flammability concerns led William Joseph Stoddard, a dry cleaner from [[Atlanta]], to develop [[Stoddard solvent]] (white spirit) as a slightly less [[flammable]] alternative to gasoline-based solvents. The use of highly flammable petroleum solvents caused many fires and explosions, resulting in government regulation of dry cleaners. After [[World War&amp;nbsp;I]], dry cleaners began using [[organochloride|chlorinated]] solvents. These solvents were much less flammable than petroleum solvents and had improved cleaning power.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

===Shift to tetrachloroethylene===
By the mid-1930s, the dry cleaning industry had adopted [[tetrachloroethylene]] (perchloroethylene), or PCE for short, as the solvent. It has excellent cleaning power and is nonflammable and compatible with most garments.  Because it is stable, tetrachloroethylene is readily recycled.&lt;ref name="Ullmann"/&gt;

===Infrastructure===
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}Traditionally, the cleaning process was carried out at centralized factories. Small, local cleaners' shops received garments from customers, sent them to the factory, and then had them returned to the shop for collection by the customer. This cycle minimized the risk of fire or dangerous fumes created by the cleaning process. At this time, dry cleaning was carried out in two different machines—one for the cleaning process, and the second to remove the solvent from the garments.

Machines of this era were described as ''vented''; their drying exhausts were expelled to the atmosphere, the same as many modern tumble-dryer exhausts. This not only contributed to environmental contamination but also much potentially reusable PCE was lost to the atmosphere. Much stricter controls on solvent emissions have ensured that all dry cleaning machines in the Western world are now fully enclosed, and no solvent fumes are vented to the atmosphere. {{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} In enclosed machines, solvent recovered during the drying process is returned condensed and distilled, so it can be reused to clean further loads or safely disposed of. The majority of modern enclosed machines also incorporate a computer-controlled drying sensor, which automatically senses when all detectable traces of PCE have been removed. This system ensures that only small amounts of PCE fumes are released at the end of the cycle.

== Mechanism ==
[[image:Cellulose Sessel.svg|thumb|left|220 px|Structure of cellulose, the main constituent of cotton.  The many OH [[functional group|groups]] bind water, leading to swelling of the fabric and leading to wrinkling, which is minimized when these materials are treated with tetrachloroethylene and other dry cleaning solvents.]]
In terms of mechanism, dry cleaning selectively solubilizes stains on the article.  The [[solvent]]s are non-polar and tend to selectively extract compounds that cause stains. These stains would otherwise only dissolve in aqueous detergents mixtures at high temperatures, potentially damaging delicate fabrics.

Non-polar solvents are also good for some fabrics, especially natural fabrics, as the solvent does not interact with any polar groups within the fabric. Water binds to these polar groups which results in the swelling and stretching of proteins within fibers during laundry. Also, the binding of water molecules interferes with weak attractions within the fiber, resulting in the loss of the fiber's original shape. After the laundry cycle, water molecules will dry off. However, the original shape of the fibers has already been distorted and this commonly results in shrinkage. Non-polar solvents prevent this interaction, protecting more delicate fabrics.

The usage of an effective solvent coupled with mechanical friction from tumbling effectively removes stains.

==Process==

A dry-cleaning machine is similar to a combination of a domestic washing machine and clothes dryer. Garments are placed in the washing or extraction chamber (referred to as the 'basket' or 'drum'), which constitutes the core of the machine. The washing chamber contains a horizontal, perforated drum that rotates within an outer shell. The shell holds the solvent while the rotating drum holds the garment load. The basket capacity is between about 10 and 40&amp;nbsp;kg (22 to 88&amp;nbsp;lb).{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

During the wash cycle, the chamber is filled approximately one-third full of solvent and begins to rotate, agitating the clothing. The solvent temperature is maintained at 30&amp;nbsp;degrees Celsius (86&amp;nbsp;degrees Fahrenheit), as a higher temperature may damage it. During the wash cycle, the solvent in the chamber (commonly known as the 'cage' or 'tackle box') is passed through a filtration chamber and then fed back into the 'cage'. This is known as the cycle and is continued for the wash duration. The solvent is then removed and sent to a [[distillation]] unit consisting of a [[boiler]] and [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condenser]]. The condensed solvent is fed into a separator unit where any remaining water is separated from the solvent and then fed into the 'clean solvent' tank. The ideal flow rate is roughly 8 liters of solvent per kilogram of garments per minute, depending on the size of the machine.

Garments are also checked for foreign objects. Items such as [[plastic]] pens that may dissolve in the solvent bath, damaging the textiles. Some textile [[dye]]s are "loose" and will shed dye during solvent immersion. Fragile items, such as feather bedspreads or tasseled rugs or hangings, may be enclosed in a loose mesh bag. The [[density]] of perchloroethylene is around 1.7 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; at room temperature (70% heavier than water), and the sheer weight of absorbed solvent may cause the textile to fail under normal force during the extraction cycle unless the mesh bag provides mechanical support.

Not all [[stain]]s can be removed by dry cleaning. Some need to be treated with spotting solvents — sometimes by steam jet or by soaking in special stain-remover liquids — before garments are washed or dry cleaned. Also, garments stored in soiled condition for a long time are difficult to bring back to their original color and texture.

A typical wash cycle lasts for 8–15 minutes depending on the type of garments and degree of soiling. During the first three minutes, solvent-soluble soils dissolve into the perchloroethylene and loose, insoluble soil comes off. It takes 10–12 minutes after the loose soil has come off to remove the ground-in insoluble soil from garments. Machines using hydrocarbon solvents require a wash cycle of at least 25&amp;nbsp;minutes because of the much slower rate of solvation of solvent-soluble soils. A dry cleaning [[surfactant]] "soap" may also be added.

At the end of the wash cycle, the machine starts a rinse cycle where the garment load is rinsed with freshly distilled solvent dispensed from the solvent tank. This pure solvent rinse prevents discoloration caused by soil particles being absorbed back onto the garment surface from the 'dirty' working solvent.

After the rinse cycle, the machine begins the extraction process, which recovers the solvent for reuse. Modern machines recover approximately 99.99% of the solvent employed. The extraction cycle begins by draining the solvent from the washing chamber and accelerating the basket to 350–450&amp;nbsp;[[Revolutions per minute|rpm]], causing much of the solvent to spin free of the fabric. Until this time, the cleaning is done in normal temperature, as the solvent is never heated in dry cleaning process. When no more solvent can be spun out, the machine starts the drying cycle.

During the drying cycle, the garments are tumbled in a stream of warm air (60–63&amp;nbsp;°C/140–145&amp;nbsp;°F) that circulates through the basket, evaporating traces of solvent left after the spin cycle. The air temperature is controlled to prevent heat damage to the garments. The exhausted warm air from the machine then passes through a chiller unit where solvent vapors are condensed and returned to the distilled solvent tank. Modern dry cleaning machines use a closed-loop system in which the chilled air is reheated and recirculated. This results in high solvent recovery rates and reduced air pollution. In the early days of dry cleaning, large amounts of perchlorethylene were vented to the atmosphere because it was regarded as cheap and believed to be harmless.

[[File:Dry clean rack.jpg|thumbnail|Many dry cleaners place cleaned clothes inside thin clear plastic garment bags]]
After the drying cycle is complete, a deodorizing ([[aeration]]) cycle cools the garments and removes further traces of solvent, by circulating cool outside air over the garments and then through a vapor recovery filter made from [[activated carbon]] and polymer resins. After the aeration cycle, the garments are clean and ready for pressing and finishing.

==Solvent processing==
[[File:Saver40.jpg|thumb|440x440px|A Firbimatic Saver Series. This machine uses activated clay filtration instead of distillation. It uses much less energy than conventional methods.]]
Working solvent from the washing chamber passes through several [[filtration]] steps before it is returned to the washing chamber. The first step is a button trap, which prevents small objects such as lint, fasteners, buttons, and coins from entering the solvent pump.

Over time, a thin layer of [[filter cake]] (called "muck") accumulates on the lint filter. The muck is removed regularly (commonly once per day) and then processed to recover solvent trapped in the muck. Many machines use "spin [[disk filter]]s", which remove the muck from the filter by [[centrifugal force]] while it is back washed with solvent.

After the lint filter, the solvent passes through an [[Absorption (chemistry)|absorptive]] cartridge filter. This filter, which contains activated clays and charcoal, removes fine insoluble soil and non-volatile residues, along with dyes from the solvent. Finally, the solvent passes through a polishing filter, which removes any soil not previously removed. The clean solvent is then returned to the working solvent tank. Cooked powder residue is the name for the waste material generated by cooking down or distilling muck. It will contain solvent, powdered filter material (diatomite), carbon, non-volatile residues, lint, dyes, grease, soils, and water.  The waste sludge or solid residue from the still contains solvent, water, soils, carbon, and other non-volatile residues. Used filters are another form of waste as is waste water.

To enhance cleaning power, small amounts of [[detergent]] (0.5–1.5%) are added to the working solvent and are essential to its functionality. These detergents emulsify [[hydrophobic]] soils and keep soil from redepositing on garments. Depending on the machine's design, either an anionic or a cationic detergent is used.

==Symbols==
The international [[GINETEX]] [[laundry symbol]] for dry cleaning is a circle. It may have the letter P inside it to indicate perchloroethylene solvent, or the letter F to indicate a flammable solvent (Feuergefährliches Schwerbenzin). A bar underneath the circle indicates that only mild cleaning processes is recommended. A crossed-out empty circle indicates that dry cleaning is not permitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sartex.ch/en/textilkennzeichnung/pflegekennzeichnung/pflegesymbole/textilpflege/ |title=Professional textile care  symbols |publisher=GINETEX - Swiss Association for Textile Labelling |accessdate=2013-07-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528201142/http://www.sartex.ch/en/textilkennzeichnung/pflegekennzeichnung/pflegesymbole/textilpflege/ |archivedate=2013-05-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Solvents used==
===Perchloroethylene===
[[Perchloroethylene]] (PCE, or tetrachloroethylene) has been in use since the 1930s. PCE is the most common solvent, the "standard" for cleaning performance. It is a most effective cleaning solvent.  It is thermally stable, recyclable, and has low toxicity.  It can, however, cause color bleeding/loss, especially at higher temperatures.  In some cases it may damage special trims, buttons, and beads on some garments. It is better for oil-based stains (which account for about 10% of stains) than more common water-soluble stains (coffee, wine, blood, etc.).  The toxicity of tetrachloroethylene "is moderate to low" and "Reports of human injury are uncommon despite its wide usage in dry cleaning and degreasing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = E.-L. Dreher | author2 = T. R. Torkelson | author3 = K. K. Beutel | chapter = Chlorethanes and Chloroethylenes | title = Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry | year = 2011 | publisher = Wiley-VCH | location = Weinheim | doi = 10.1002/14356007.o06_o01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. state of California classified perchloroethylene a toxic chemical in 1991, and its use will become illegal in that state in 2023.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16816627 | title = California bans dry cleaning chemical | publisher = [[msnbc.com]] | date = 2007-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is still probably the most universally used dry cleaning solvent, at the present time.

=== Hydrocarbons ===
[[Hydrocarbon]]s are represented by products such as [[Exxon-Mobil]]'s DF-2000 or [[Chevron Phillips]]' EcoSolv, and Pure Dry. These [[petroleum]]-based solvents are less aggressive but also less effective than PCE.  Although combustible, risk of fire or explosion can be minimized when used properly. Hydrocarbons are however pollutants.  Hydrocarbons retain about 10-12% of the market.

[[File:Union K Series Dry Cleaning Machine.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A modern dry cleaning machine for use with various solvents]]

=== Trichloroethylene===
[[Trichloroethylene]] is more aggressive than PCE but is very rarely used. With superior degreasing properties, it was often used for industrial workwear/overalls cleaning in the past.  TCE is classified as carcinogenic to humans by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;EPA Releases Final Health Assessment for TCE [http://yosemite.epa.gov/opa/admpress.nsf/0/B8D0E4D8489AD991852579190058D6C3] September 2011. Accessed 2011-09-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Supercritical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;===
[[Supercritical CO2|Supercritical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] is an alternative to PCE, however it is inferior in removing some forms of grime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://resource.wur.nl/en/wetenschap/detail/dry-cleaning_with_co2_wins_award/ |title=Dry-cleaning with CO2 wins award [Science&amp;#93; Resource |publisher=Resource.wur.nl |date=2010-10-12 |accessdate=2013-03-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312013535/http://resource.wur.nl/en/wetenschap/detail/dry-cleaning_with_co2_wins_award/ |archivedate=2012-03-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additive surfactants improve the efficacy of CO&lt;sub&gt;2.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/1074194/How_can_we_use_carbon_dioxide_as_a_solvent|title=How can we use carbon dioxide as a solvent?|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|publication-place=Contemporary topics in school science|access-date=2016-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Carbon dioxide is almost entirely nontoxic.  The greenhouse gas potential is also lower than that of many organic solvents.

''[[Consumer Reports]]'' rated supercritical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; superior to conventional methods, but the Drycleaning and Laundry Institute commented on its "fairly low cleaning ability" in a 2007 report.&lt;ref&gt;Drycleaning and Laundry Institute. "The DLI White Paper: Key Information on Industry Solvents." ''The Western Cleaner &amp; Launderer'', August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Supercritical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is, overall, a mild solvent which lowers its ability to aggressively attack stains.

One deficiency with supercritical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is that its conductivity is low. As mentioned in the Mechanisms section, dry cleaning utilizes both chemical and mechanical properties to remove stains. When solvent interacts with the fabric's surface, the friction dislocates dirt. At the same time, the friction also builds up an electrical charge. Fabrics are very poor conductors and so usually, this build-up is discharged through the solvent. This discharge does not occur in liquid carbon dioxide and the build-up of an electrical charge on the surface of the fabric attracts the dirt back on to the surface, which diminishes its poor clearning efficiency. To compensate for the poor solubility and conductivity of supercritical carbon dioxide, research has focused on additives. For increased solubility, 2-propanol has shown increased cleaning effects for liquid carbon dioxide as it increases the ability of the solvent to dissolve polar compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Townsend|first=Carl W.|title=Liquid carbon dioxide cleaning system employing a static dissipating fluid|date=28 Jul 1998|url=http://www.google.ch/patents/US5784905|inventor-last=Townsend|inventor2-last=Chao|inventor3-last=Purer|inventor-first=Carl W.|inventor2-first=Sidney C.|inventor3-first=Edna M.|last2=Chao|last3=Purer|first2=Sidney C.|first3=Edna M.|accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Machinery for use of supercritical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is expensive — up to $90,000 more than a PCE machine, making affordability difficult for small businesses. Some cleaners with these machines keep traditional machines on-site for the heavier soiled textiles, but others find plant enzymes to be equally effective and more environmentally sustainable.

===Other solvents: niche, emerging, etc.===
For decades, efforts have been made to replace PCE.  These alternatives have not proven economical thus far:
* [[Stoddard solvent]] – flammable and explosive, 100&amp;nbsp;°F/38&amp;nbsp;°C [[flash point]]
* [[CFC-113]] (Freon-113), a [[Chlorofluorocarbon|CFC]]. Now banned as ozone unfriendly.
*[[Decamethylcyclopentasiloxane]] ("liquid silicone"), called D5 for short. It was popularized by GreenEarth Cleaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/theres-a-better-way-to-dry-clean-your-clothes-1634895806|title=There's a Better Way to Dry Clean Your Clothes|last=Tarantola|first=Andrew|date=|website=|publisher=Gizmodo|language=en-US|access-date=2016-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is more expensive than PCE. It degrades within days in the environment.
*[[Dibutoxymethane]] (SolvonK4) is a bipolar solvent that removes water-based stains and oil-based stains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Occupational exposures to new dry cleaning solvents: High-flashpoint hydrocarbons and butylal|authors=Ceballos, Diana M.; Whittaker, Stephen G.; Lee, Eun Gyung; Roberts, Jennifer; Streicher, Robert; Nourian, Fariba; Gong, Wei; Broadwater, Kendra|journal=Journal of Occupational and Environmental Hygiene|year=2016|volume=13|pages=759–769|doi=10.1080/15459624.2016.1177648}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Brominated solvents ([[n-propyl bromide]], Fabrisolv, DrySolv) are solvents with a higher [[Kauri-butanol value|KB-value]]s than PCE. This allows faster cleaning, but can damage some synthetic beads and sequins if not used correctly. Healthwise, there are reported risks associated with nPB such as numbness of nerves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdph.ca.gov/programs/hesis/Documents/bpropane.pdf "HAZARD EVALUATION 1-Bromopropane"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106024756/http://www.cdph.ca.gov/programs/hesis/Documents/bpropane.pdf |date=2013-11-06 }} July 2003. Accessed 2014-Jan-22&lt;/ref&gt; The exposure to the solvents in a typical dry cleaner is considered far below the levels required to cause any risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 19367044| year = 2009| author1 = Azimi Pirsaraei| first1 = S.

It is among the more expensive solvents, but it is faster cleaning, lower temperatures, and quick dry times.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10386">An '''ethnic bioweapon''' (''biogenetic weapon'') is a type of theoretical [[bioweapon]] that aims to harm only or primarily people of specific ethnicities or [[genotype]]s.

== History ==
One of the first modern fictional discussions of ethnic weapons is in [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s 1942 novel ''[[Sixth Column]]'' (republished as ''The Day After Tomorrow''), in which a race-specific [[radiation]] weapon is used against a so-called "[[Pan-Asianism|Pan-Asian]]" invader{{fact|date=February 2012}}.

=== Genetic weapons ===
In 1997, [[U.S. Secretary of Defense]] [[William Cohen]] referred to the concept of an ethnic bioweapon as a possible risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=William Cohen|title=Terrorism, Weapons of Mass Destruction, and U.S. Strategy|date=1997-04-28|work=Sam Nunn Policy Forum, University of Georgia|url=http://www.defenselink.mil/transcripts/1997/t042897_t0428coh.html|accessdate=2006-07-12|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041118074748/http://www.defense.gov/transcripts/1997/t042897_t0428coh.html|archivedate=2004-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998 some biological weapon experts considered such a "genetic weapon" plausible, and believed the former [[Soviet Union]] had undertaken some research on the influence of various substances on human genes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/plague/interviews/davis.html Interview of Dr Christopher Davis, UK Defence Intelligence Staff], ''Plague War'', [[Frontline (TV series)|Frontline]], [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]], October 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

In its 2000 policy paper [[Rebuilding America's Defenses]], think-tank [[Project for the New American Century]] (PNAC) described ethnic bioweapons as a potentially "politically useful tool". PNAC went on to provide substantial staffing for the Bush Jr administration.&lt;ref name=RAD2000&gt;{{cite web|title=''Rebuilding America's Defenses: Strategies, Forces, and Resources For a New Century'' |url=http://www.newamericancentury.org/RebuildingAmericasDefenses.pdf |date=September 2000 |accessdate=May 30, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130817122719/http://www.newamericancentury.org/RebuildingAmericasDefenses.pdf |archivedate=August 17, 2013 |deadurl=unfit }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The possibility of a "genetic bomb" is presented in [[Vincent Sarich]]'s and [[Frank Miele]]'s book, ''[[Race: The Reality of Human Differences]]'', published in 2004. These authors view such weapons as technically feasible but not very likely to be used. (page 248 of paperback edition.)

In 2004, ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that the [[British Medical Association]] (BMA) considered bioweapons designed to target certain ethnic groups as a possibility, and highlighted problems that advances in science for such things as "treatment to [[Alzheimer's]] and other debilitating diseases could also be used for malign purposes".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the official view of the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] was "The potential to target a particular ethnic group with a biological agent is probably not far off. These scenarios are not the product of the ICRC's imagination but have either occurred or been identified by countless independent and governmental experts."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/misc/gas-protocol-100605.htm Preventing the use of biological and chemical weapons: 80 years on], Official Statement by Jacques Forster, vice-president of the [[International Committee of the Red Cross|ICRC]], 10-06-2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the US government held a congressional committee, ‘Genetics and other human modification technologies: sensible international regulation or a new kind of arms race?’, during which it was discussed how “we can anticipate a world where rogue (and even not-so-rogue) states and non-state actors attempt to manipulate human genetics in ways that will horrify us”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thebadgeronline.com/2018/05/ethic-bioweapons-conspiracy-reality/|title=Ethnic-bioweapons: between conspiracy and reality - The Badger|date=2018-05-08|work=The Badger|access-date=2018-06-21|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, ''[[The Atlantic]]'' wrote that a specific virus that targets individuals with a specific DNA sequence is within possibility in the near future. The magazine put forward a hypothetical scenario of a virus which caused mild flu to the general population but deadly symptoms to the [[President of the United States]]. They cite advances in personalized gene therapy as evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' magazine suggested the possibility of a virus used as an ethnic bioweapon that could [[Sterilization (medicine)|sterilize]] a "genetically-related ethnic population."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/03/15/can-there-be-war-without-soldiers-weapons-cyberwarfare/|title=Can There Be War Without Soldiers?|last=Brooks|first=Rosa|date=2016-03-15|website=Foreign Policy|access-date=2016-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Israeli "ethno-bomb" controversy ==
In November 1998, ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'' reported that Israel was attempting to build an "ethno-bomb" containing a biological agent that could specifically target genetic traits present amongst Arab populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Israel planning 'ethnic' bomb as Saddam caves in|author=Uzi Mahnaimi|author2=Marie Colvin|publisher=[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]|date=1998-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Wired News]]'' also reported the story,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Israel's Ethnic Weapon? |publisher=[[Wired News]] |url=https://www.wired.com/news/politics/0,1283,16272,00.html |date=1998-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/news/9904,ridgeway,3697,6.html |title=Ethnic Warfare |publisher=[[The Village Voice]] |author=James Ridgeway |date=1999-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; as did ''[[Foreign Reports|Foreign Report]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://listserv.buffalo.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9811&amp;L=justwatch-l&amp;D=0&amp;P=28059 |title=UPI report}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Microbiologists and geneticists were skeptical towards the scientific plausibility of such a biological agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stein|first1=Jeff|title=Debunking the “ethno-bomb”|url=http://www.salon.com/1998/12/02/news_154/|website=Salon|accessdate=25 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[New York Post]]'', describing the claims as "[[blood libel]]", reported that the likely source for the story was a work of science fiction by Israeli academic [[Doron Stanitsky]]. Stanitsky had sent his completely fictional work about such a weapon to Israeli newspapers two years before. The article also noted the views of genetic researchers who claimed the idea as "wholly fantastical", with others claiming that the weapon was theoretically possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Now Playing: A Blood Libel For The 21st Century|publisher=[[New York Post]]|date=1998-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/talk.politics.mideast/QJKAhCi8UY0/uTqlQUSv8goJ|title=Google Groups quoting Haaretz|website=groups.google.com|access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A planned second installment of the article never appeared, and no sources were ever identified. Neither of the authors of the ''Sunday Times'' story, [[Uzi Mahnaimi]] and [[Marie Colvin]], have spoken publicly on the matter{{fact|date=February 2012}}.

==Russian ban on export of biological samples==
In May 2007, a Russian newspaper ''[[Kommersant]]'' reported that the Russian government banned all exports of human biosamples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kommersant.ru/doc.html?docId=769777|title=Россия блюдет человеческий образец
|date=2007-05-29|accessdate=2007-05-29|publisher=[[Kommersant]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The report claims that the reason for the ban was a secret [[FSB (Russia)|FSB]] report about on-going development of "genetic bioweapons" targeting Russian population by Western institutions. The report mentions the [[Harvard School of Public Health]], American International Health Alliance, Department of Medical Biotechnology of Jagiellonian University, [[United States Department of Justice Environment and Natural Resources Division]], Institute of Genetics and Biotechnology Warsaw University, and [[United States Agency for International Development]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3004">The '''European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism''' ('''ESPEN''') is an organization in the field of [[parenteral nutrition|parenteral]] and [[enteral]] nutrition and promotes basic and clinical research, basic and advanced education, organization of consensus statements about clinical care and care quality control.

In 1979 an informal meeting laid the foundations of ESPEN, deciding to create a multidisciplinary society devoted to the study of metabolic problems associated with acute diseases and their nutritional implications and management. ESPEN was formally established in 1980 as the European Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition. It later changed its name to the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism. 
 
Congress meetings are held every year in a different European city&lt;ref (ctrl-click)"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espen.org/pastcongresses.html |title=The European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism |publisher=ESPEN |date= |accessdate=2012-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and gather over 3,000 participants from 82 different countries.&lt;ref&gt;MCI (January 2010). "Book of Congress statistics"&lt;/ref&gt;

A bimonthly journal named ''[[Clinical Nutrition (journal)|Clinical Nutrition]]'', which goes along with ''Clinical Nutrition Supplements'' and an electronic journal ''e-SPEN'' are the society's official publications, published by [[Elsevier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elsevier.com/locate/clnu |title=Clinical Nutrition |publisher=Elsevier |date= |accessdate=2012-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

European Parenteral and Enteral National Societies support ESPEN in the form of block members, e.g. the British,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bapen.org.uk/ce_espen.html |title=Joining ESPEN |publisher=Bapen.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; German,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dgem.de/mitgliedsch.htm |title=DGEM - Mitgliedschaft |publisher=Dgem.de |date= |accessdate=2012-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; French,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfnep.org/component/content/article/101 |title=Devenir membre |publisher=Sfnep.org |date= |accessdate=2012-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Austrian societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ake-nutrition.at/ESPEN_MEMBERSHIP.20.0.html |title=Ake-Nutrition: Espen Membership |publisher=Ake-nutrition.at |date= |accessdate=2012-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the umbrella of ESPEN, many ongoing projects are supported by its members, such as [[NutritionDay]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nutritionday.org |title=HOME |publisher=nutritionDay.org |date= |accessdate=2012-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Home Artificial Nutrition, and Fight Against Malnutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espen.org/video/VideoPlayer.html |title=VideoPlayer |publisher=Espen.org |date= |accessdate=2012-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13403">The '''glycemic load (GL)''' of food is a number that estimates how much the food will raise a person's [[blood glucose level]] after eating it. One unit of glycemic load approximates the effect of consuming one gram of glucose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glycemic Load Defined|url=http://www.glycemic.com/GlycemicIndex-LoadDefined.htm|publisher=Glycemic Research Institute|accessdate=8 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glycemic load accounts for how much [[carbohydrate]] is in the food and how much each gram of carbohydrate in the food raises blood glucose levels. Glycemic load is based on the [[glycemic index]] (GI), and is calculated by multiplying the grams of available carbohydrate in the food by the food's glycemic index, and then dividing by 100.

==Description==
Glycemic load estimates the impact of carbohydrate consumption using the glycemic index while taking into account the amount of carbohydrate that is consumed. GL is a GI-weighted measure of carbohydrate content. For instance, [[watermelon]] has a high GI, but a typical serving of watermelon does not contain much carbohydrate, so the glycemic load of eating it is low. Whereas glycemic index is defined for each type of food, glycemic load can be calculated for any size serving of a food, an entire meal, or an entire day's meals.

Glycemic load of a serving of food can be calculated as its carbohydrate content measured in grams (g), multiplied by the food's GI, and divided by 100. For example, watermelon has a GI of 72. A 100&amp;nbsp;g serving of watermelon has 5&amp;nbsp;g of available carbohydrates (it contains a lot of water), making the calculation 5 × 72/100=3.6, so the GL is 4. A food with a GI of 100 and 10&amp;nbsp;g of available carbohydrates has a GL of 10 (10 × 100/100=10), while a food with 100&amp;nbsp;g of carbohydrate and a GI of just 10 also has a GL of 10 (100 × 10/100=10).

For one serving of a food, a GL greater than 20 is considered high, a GL of 11–19 is considered medium, and a GL of 10 or less is considered low. Foods that have a low GL in a typical serving size almost always have a low GI. Foods with an intermediate or high GL in a typical serving size range from a very low to very high GI.

One 2007 study has questioned the value of using glycemic load as a basis for weight-loss programmes. Das et al. conducted a study on 36 healthy, overweight adults, using a randomised test to measure the efficacy of two diets, one with a high glycemic load and one with a low GL. The study concluded that there is no statistically significant difference between the outcome of the two diets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Das|first=Sai Krupa|title=Long-term effects of 2 energy-restricted diets differing in glycemic load on dietary adherence, body composition, and metabolism in CALERIE: a 1-y randomized controlled trial|journal=American Journal of Clinical Nutrition|date=April 2007|volume=85|issue=4|pages=1023–30|pmid=17413101|url=http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/85/4/1023.full|accessdate=8 February 2013|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Glycemic load appears to be a significant factor in dietary programs targeting metabolic syndrome, [[insulin resistance]], and weight loss; studies have shown that sustained spikes in blood sugar and insulin levels may lead to increased [[diabetes]] risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ludwig|first=Daniel S.|title=The glycemic index: physiological mechanisms relating to obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease|journal=Journal of the American Medical Association|date=May 2002|volume=287|issue=18|pages=2414–2423|doi=10.1001/jama.287.18.2414|pmid=11988062}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Shanghai Women's Health Study concluded that women whose diets had the highest glycemic index were 21 percent more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than women whose diets had the lowest glycemic index.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Villegas|first=Raquel|author2=Liu, Simin |author3=Gao, Yu-Tang |author4=Yang, Gong |author5=Li, Honglan |author6=Zheng, Wei |author7= Shu, Xiao Ou |title=Prospective Study of Dietary Carbohydrates, Glycemic Index, Glycemic Load, and Incidence of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Middle-aged Chinese Women|journal=Archives of Internal Medicine|year=2007|volume=167|issue=21|pages=2310–16|doi=10.1001/archinte.167.21.2310|pmid=18039989|url=http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=413531|accessdate=8 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar findings were reported in the Black Women's Health Study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Krishnan|first=Supriya|author2=Rosenberg, Lynn |author3=Singer, Martha |author4=Hu, Frank B. |author5=Djoussé, Luc |author6=Cupples, L.

The data on GI and GL listed in this article is from the [[University of Sydney]] (Human Nutrition Unit) GI database.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glycemic Index Database|url=http://www.glycemicindex.com/|publisher=University of Sydney|accessdate=8 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GI was invented in 1981 by Dr Thomas Wolever and Dr David Jenkins at the University of Toronto and is a measure of how quickly a food containing 25 or 50&amp;nbsp;grams of carbohydrate raises blood-glucose levels. Because some foods typically have a low carbohydrate content, Harvard researchers created the GL, which takes into account the amount of carbohydrates in a given serving of a food and so provides a more useful measure. Liu et al. were the first to show that based on their calculation, the glycemic load of a specific food—calculated as the product of that food's carbohydrate content and its glycemic index value—has direct physiologic meaning in that each unit can be interpreted as the equivalent of 1 g carbohydrate from white bread (or glucose depending on the reference used in determining the glycemic index).&lt;ref&gt;Liu S, Willett WC, Stampfer MJ, Hu FB, Franz M, Sampson L, Hennekens CH, Manson JE.

''Am J Clin Nutr''. 2002 Mar; 75(3): 492–98. {{PMID|11864854}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became immediately apparent that such direct physiological quantification of glycemic load would allow patients with diabetes to do “glycemic load” counting as opposed to the conventional “carbohydrate counting” for monitoring the glycemic effect of foods.&lt;ref&gt;Schulze MB, Liu S, Rimm EB, Manson JE, Willett WC, Hu FB. "Glycemic index, glycemic load, and dietary fiber intake and incidence of type 2 diabetes in younger and middle-aged women". ''Am J Clin Nutr''. 2004 Aug; 80(2): 348–56. {{PMID|15277155}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Qi L, Rimm E, Liu S, Rifai N, Hu FB. "Dietary glycemic index, glycemic load, cereal fiber, and plasma adiponectin concentration in diabetic men".

For example, although the glycemic index for carrots is reported to be as high as 131, the glycemic load for one serving of carrots is small because the amount of carbohydrate in one serving of carrots is minimal (≈7 g carbohydrate). Indeed, ≈700 g carrots (which provides 50 g carbohydrate) must be consumed to produce an incremental glucose response 1.3 times that of 100 g white bread containing 50 g carbohydrate.&lt;ref&gt;Gross LS, Li L, Ford ES, Liu S.

"Intake of refined carbohydrates and whole grain foods in relation to risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus and coronary heart disease". ''J Am Coll Nutr'' 2002; 21: 298–306. {{PMID|12166526}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

A '''Health Equity Impact Analysis''' is a decision support tool which walks users through the steps of identifying how a program, [[policy]] or similar initiative will impact [[populations|population groups]] in different ways. HEIAs are meant to show, ''inter alia'', unintended potential impacts. The goal is to maximize positive impacts and reduce negative impacts that could potentially widen [[health]] [[health disparity|disparities]] between population groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.health.gov.on.ca/en/pro/programs/heia/|title=Health Equity Impact Assessment (HEIA) - Ministry Programs - Health Care Professionals - MOHLTC|work=gov.on.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tea drinking accounts for a high proportion of aluminum in the human diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.foodchem.2007.03.019 |journal=Food Chemistry |volume=104 |issue=4 |year=2007 |pages=1662–1669 |vauthors=Streeta R, Drábeka O, Szákováb J, Mládkováa L |title=Total content and speciation of aluminium in tea leaves and tea infusions}}&lt;/ref&gt; The levels are safe, but there has been some concern that aluminum traces may be associated with [[Alzheimer's disease]]. A 2013 study additionally indicated that some teas contained [[lead]] (mostly Chinese) and aluminum (Indian/Sri Lanka blends, China).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Benefits and Risks of Consuming Brewed Tea: Beware of Toxic Element Contamination | doi=10.1155/2013/370460 | pmid=24260033 | pmc=3821942 | volume=2013 | journal=Journal of Toxicology | pages=1–8| year=2013 | last1=Schwalfenberg | first1=Gerry | last2=Genuis | first2=Stephen J. | last3=Rodushkin | first3=Ilia }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is still insufficient evidence to draw firm conclusions on this subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Food Research International |volume=43 |issue=9 |year=2010 |pages=2234–2252 |title=Trace elements in tea leaves, made tea and tea infusion: A review |type=Review |vauthors=Karak T, Bhagat RM |doi=10.1016/j.foodres.2010.08.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Fluoride#Toxicology}}
All tea leaves contain [[fluoride]]; however, mature leaves contain as much as 10 to 20 times the fluoride levels of young leaves from the same plant.&lt;ref name="pmid17410113"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lung SC, Cheng HW, Fu CB |title=Potential exposure and risk of fluoride intakes from tea drinks produced in Taiwan |journal=J Expo Sci Environ Epidemiol |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=158–66 |year=2008 |pmid=17410113 |doi=10.1038/sj.jes.7500574}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18078704"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Malinowska E, Inkielewicz I, Czarnowski W, Szefer P |title=Assessment of fluoride concentration and daily intake by human from tea and herbal infusions |journal=Food Chem.

The fluoride content of a tea leaf depends on the leaf picking method used and the fluoride content of the soil from which it has been grown; tea plants absorb this element at a greater rate than other plants. Care in the choice of the location where the plant is grown may reduce the risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Accumulation of Fluoride and Aluminium Related to Different Varieties of Tea Plant |author1=Jianyun Ruan |author2=Ming H. Wong | journal = Environmental Geochemistry and Health | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 53–63 | year =  2001 | url =   | doi = 10.1023/A:1011082608631}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is speculated that hand-picked tea would contain less fluoride than machine-harvested tea, because there is a much lower chance of harvesting older leaves during the harvest process. A 2013 British study of 38 teas found that cheaper UK supermarket tea blends had the highest levels of fluoride with about 580&amp;nbsp;mg per kilogram, green teas averaged about 397&amp;nbsp;mg per kg and pure blends about 132&amp;nbsp;mg per kg. The researchers suggested that economy teas may use older leaves which contain more fluoride. They calculated a person drinking a litre of economy tea per day would consume about 6&amp;nbsp;mg of fluoride, above the recommended average dietary intake level of 3-4&amp;nbsp;mg of fluoride per day, but below the maximum tolerable amount of 10&amp;nbsp;mg of fluoride per day.&lt;ref&gt;(25 July 2013) [http://www.nhs.uk/news/2013/07July/Pages/do-fluoride-levels-in-cheap-tea-pose-a-health-risk.aspx Do fluoride levels in cheap tea pose a health risk?] British National Health Service "Choices, Retrieved 26 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Oxalates ===
Tea contains [[oxalate]], overconsumption of which can cause [[kidney]] stones, as well as binding with free [[calcium]] in the body. The [[bioavailability]] of oxalate from tea is low, thus a possible negative effect requires a large intake of tea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

=== Theanine and caffeine ===
{{see also|Health effects of caffeine}}
Tea also contains [[theanine]] and the stimulant [[caffeine]] at about 3% of its dry weight, translating to between 30&amp;nbsp;mg and 90&amp;nbsp;mg per 8 oz (250 ml) cup depending on type, brand&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Bennett Alan Weinberg |author2=Bonnie K. Bealer |title=The World of Caffeine: The Science and Culture of the World's Most Popular Drug |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YdpL2YCGLVYC&amp;dq= |publisher=Routledge |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-415-92722-2 |accessdate=2008-09-20 |page=228}}&lt;/ref&gt; and brewing method.&lt;ref&gt;M. B. Hicks, Y-H. P. Hsieh, L. N. Bell, ''Tea preparation and its influence on methylxanthine concentration'', Food Research International 29(3-4) 325-330 (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; Tea also contains small amounts of [[theobromine]] and [[theophylline]].&lt;ref&gt;Graham H. N.; Green tea composition, consumption, and polyphenol chemistry; ''Preventive Medicine'' '''21'''(3):334-50 (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; Dry tea has more caffeine by weight than dry [[coffee]]; nevertheless, more dry coffee than dry tea is used in typical drink preparations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stashtea.com/caffeine+and+tea+information.aspx |title=Caffeine and Tea Information |publisher=Stash Tea |date= |accessdate=2009-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; which results in a cup of brewed tea containing significantly less caffeine than a cup of [[health effects of coffee|coffee]] of the same size.

The caffeine in tea is a mild [[diuretic]]. However, the [[British Dietetic Association]] has suggested that tea can be used to supplement normal [[water]] consumption, and that "the style of tea and coffee and the amounts we drink in the UK are unlikely to have a negative effect [on hydration]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bda.uk.com/news/110610DehydrationWeek.pdf  BDA Supports Dehydration Awareness Week with some Handy Tips (PDF)]. British Dietetic Association, June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== By conditions ==

===Cognitive effects===
Drinking caffeinated tea may improve mental alertness.&lt;ref name=medline/&gt; There is preliminary evidence that the [[caffeine]] from long-term tea (or coffee) consumption provides a small amount of protection against the progression of [[dementia]] or [[Alzheimer's disease]] during aging, although the results across numerous studies were inconsistent.&lt;ref name="PanzaSolfrizzi2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Panza|first1=Francesco|last2=Solfrizzi|first2=V.|last3=Barulli|first3=M.

=== Cancer ===
In 2011, the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) reported that there was very little evidence to support the claim that green tea consumption may reduce the risk of breast and prostate cancer.&lt;ref name="FDA2011"&gt;{{cite web|title=Summary of Qualified Health Claims Subject to Enforcement Discretion|url=http://www.fda.gov/Food/IngredientsPackagingLabeling/LabelingNutrition/ucm073992.htm#gtea|author=[[Food and Drug Administration]]|date=24 February 2011|accessdate= 9 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The US [[National Cancer Institute]] reports that in [[Epidemiology#Types of studies|epidemiological studies]] and the few [[clinical trial]]s of tea for the prevention of cancer, the results have been inconclusive.  The institute "does not recommend for or against the use of tea to reduce the risk of any type of cancer." ... "Inconsistencies in study findings regarding tea and cancer risk may be due to variability in tea preparation, tea consumption, the bioavailability of tea compounds (the amounts that can be absorbed by the body), lifestyle differences, and individual genetic differences."&lt;ref name=NCI&gt;{{cite web|title=Tea and Cancer Prevention: Strengths and Limits of the Evidence|author=National Cancer Institute|url= http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/prevention/tea|accessdate=20 March 2012|date=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though there is some positive evidence for risk reduction of breast, prostate, ovarian, and endometrial cancers with green tea, it is weak and inconclusive.&lt;ref name=Johnson&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Johnson R, Bryant S, Huntley AL |title=Green tea and green tea catechin extracts: an overview of the clinical evidence |journal=Maturitas |volume=73 |issue=4 |pages=280–7 | date=December 2012 |pmid=22986087 |doi=10.1016/j.maturitas.2012.08.008 |type=Review |quote=Green tea consumption does help reduce body weight and aid weight management as shown in short term RCTs (12 weeks) but not to a clinically relevant level.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meta-analyses of observational studies have concluded that black tea consumption does not appear to protect against the development of [[oral cancer]]s in Asian or Caucasian populations, the development of [[esophageal cancer]] or [[prostate cancer]] in Asian populations, or the development of [[lung cancer]].&lt;ref name="OralCancer2014"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Wang W, Yang Y, Zhang W, Wu W |title=Association of tea consumption and the risk of oral cancer: a meta-analysis|journal=Oral Oncol|volume=50|issue=4|pages=276–81|date=April 2014|pmid=24389399|doi=10.1016/j.oraloncology.2013.12.014|type=Meta-Analysis}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LungCancer2012"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Wang Y, Yu X, Wu Y, Zhang D |title=Coffee and tea consumption and risk of lung cancer: a dose-response analysis of observational studies|journal=Lung Cancer|volume=78|issue=2|pages=169–70|date=November 2012|pmid=22964413|doi=10.1016/j.lungcan.2012.08.009|type=Meta-Analysis}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ProstateCancer2011"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Zheng J, Yang B, Huang T, Yu Y, Yang J, Li D |title=Green tea and black tea consumption and prostate cancer risk: an exploratory meta-analysis of observational studies|journal=Nutr Cancer|volume=63|issue=5|pages=663–72|date=June 2011|pmid=21667398|doi=10.1080/01635581.2011.570895|type=Meta-Analysis}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ProstateCancer2014"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Lin YW, Hu ZH, Wang X, Mao QQ, Qin J, Zheng XY, Xie LP |title=Tea consumption and prostate cancer: an updated meta-analysis|journal=World J Surg Oncol|volume=12|issue=|pages=38|date=February 2014|pmid=24528523|pmc=3925323|doi=10.1186/1477-7819-12-38|type=Meta-Analysis}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EsophagealCancer2013"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Zheng JS, Yang J, Fu YQ, Huang T, Huang YJ, Li D |title=Effects of green tea, black tea, and coffee consumption on the risk of esophageal cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies|journal=Nutr Cancer|volume=65|issue=1|pages=1–16|date=January 2013|pmid=23368908|doi=10.1080/01635581.2013.741762|type=Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cardiovascular disease===
In [[Prospective cohort study|preliminary long-term clinical studies]], black tea consumption showed evidence for providing a small, reduced risk of stroke,&lt;ref name="Stroke2012"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Shen L, Song LG, Ma H, Jin CN, Wang JA, Xiang MX |title=Tea consumption and risk of stroke: a dose-response meta-analysis of prospective studies|journal=J Zhejiang Univ Sci B|volume=13|issue=8|pages=652–62|date=August 2012|pmid=22843186|pmc=3411099|doi=10.1631/jzus.B1201001|type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stroke2014"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Larsson SC|title=Coffee, tea, and cocoa and risk of stroke|journal=Stroke|volume=45|issue=1|pages=309–14|date=January 2014|pmid=24326448|doi=10.1161/STROKEAHA.113.003131|type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas, in another review, green tea and black tea did not have significant effects on the risk of [[coronary heart disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Ze-Mu|last2=Zhou|first2=Bo|last3=Wang|first3=Yong-Sheng|last4=Gong|first4=Qing-Yue|last5=Wang|first5=Qi-Ming|last6=Yan|first6=Jian-Jun|last7=Gao|first7=Wei|last8=Wang|first8=Lian-Sheng|date=2011-03-01|title=Black and green tea consumption and the risk of coronary artery disease: a meta-analysis|journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition|volume=93|issue=3|pages=506–515|doi=10.3945/ajcn.110.005363|issn=1938-3207|pmid=21248184}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two reviews of [[randomized controlled trial]]s concluded that long-term consumption of black tea slightly lowers [[Blood pressure|systolic and diastolic blood pressures]] (about 1–2 mmHg), a finding based on limited evidence.&lt;ref name="Hartley2013"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Hartley L, Flowers N, Holmes J, Clarke A, Stranges S, Hooper L, Rees K |title=Green and black tea for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease|journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev|volume=6|issue=6|pages=CD009934|date=June 2013|pmid=23780706|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD009934.pub2|type=Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Liu2014"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Liu G, Mi XN, Zheng XX, Xu YL, Lu J, Huang XH |title=Effects of tea intake on blood pressure: a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials|journal=Br J Nutr|volume=112|issue=7|pages=1043–54|date=October 2014|pmid=25137341|doi=10.1017/S0007114514001731|type=Meta-Analysis}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2013 Cochrane review found some evidence of benefit from tea consumption on cardiovascular disease, though more research is needed. &lt;ref name="Hartley2013"/&gt;

===Fracture risk===
Tea consumption does not appear to affect the risk of [[bone fracture]] including [[hip fracture]]s or fractures of the [[humerus]] in men or women.&lt;ref name="Chen2014"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Chen B, Shi HF, Wu SC |title=Tea consumption didn't modify the risk of fracture: a dose-response meta-analysis of observational studies|journal=Diagn Pathol|volume=9|issue=|pages=44|date=March 2014|pmid=24588938|pmc=4017777|doi=10.1186/1746-1596-9-44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Weight loss ===

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5066">'''Health regions''', also called '''health authorities''', are a governance model used by [[Canada]]'s provincial governments to administer and deliver [[public health care]] to all Canadian residents.

Health care is designated a provincial responsibility under the separation of powers in [[Canadian federalism|Canada's federal system]]. Most health regions or health authorities are organized along geographic boundaries, however, some are organized along operational lines.

'''Health services research''' ('''HSR'''), also known as '''health systems research''' or '''health policy and systems research''' ('''HPSR'''), is a [[multidisciplinary]] scientific field that examines how people get access to [[Health Human Resources|health care practitioners]] and health care services, how much care costs, and what happens to [[patient]]s as a result of this care.&lt;ref&gt;AcademyHealth.

The primary goals of health services research are to identify the most effective ways to organize, manage, finance, and deliver high quality care; reduce medical errors; and improve [[patient safety]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ahrq.gov/ Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality], February 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; HSR is more concerned with delivery and access to care, in contrast to medical research, which focuses on the development and evaluation of clinical treatments.

Health services researchers come from a variety of specializations, including [[geography]], [[nursing]], [[economics]], [[political science]], [[epidemiology]], [[public health]], [[medicine]], [[biostatistics]], [[Business operations|operations]], [[management]], [[engineering]], [[pharmacy]], [[psychology]], [[usability]] and [[user experience design]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://uxpamagazine.org/issue/14-3 UX Magazine 14.3 - Healthy Designs], September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; While health services research is grounded in theory, its underlying aim is to perform research that can be applied by [[physicians]], [[nurses]], [[Health administration|health managers and administrators]], and other people who make decisions or deliver care in the [[health care system]].  For example, the application of epidemiological methods to the study of health services by managers is a type of health services research that can be described as [[Managerial epidemiology]]. 

==Approaches==
Approaches to HSR include:&lt;ref name="PLoS"/&gt;
*''Implementation research'': research focusing on public [[health policy|policy]] analysis, or the concerns of program managers regarding the effectiveness of specific health interventions;
*''Impact evaluation'': research with emphasis on effectiveness of health care practices and organisation of care, using a more narrow range of study methods such as [[systematic review]]s of health system interventions.

==By country==
Many data and information sources are used to conduct health services research, such as population and health surveys, clinical administrative records, health care program and financial administrative records, vital statistics records (births and deaths), and other special studies.

===United States===

====Data availability====
Claims data on US [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]] beneficiaries are available for analysis. Data is divided into public data available to any entity and research data available only to qualified researchers. The US's [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] (CMS) delegates some data export functions to a Research Data Assistance Center.&lt;ref name=resdacweb&gt;{{cite web|title=ResDAC|url=http://www.resdac.org|accessdate=30 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

23 Claims data from various states that are not limited to any particular insurer are also available for analysis via [[AHRQ]]'s HCUP project.&lt;ref name=HCUP&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ahrq.gov/research/data/hcup/index.html|title=AHRQ.gov|accessdate=30 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Centers====
Colloquially, health services research departments are often referred to as "shops"; in contrast to basic science research "labs".  Broadly, these shops are hosted by three general types of institutions—government, academic, or non-governmental think tanks or professional societies.

Government Sponsored
*[[Department of Veterans Affairs Under Secretary's Award in Health Services Research|U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Award in Health Services Research]]
*[[Institute of Medicine]], U.S.-based policy research organization

University Sponsored
*Center for Surgery and Public Health, U.S. -based research institute at the Brigham and Women's Hospital (Harvard University Affiliate)
* [[Regenstrief Institute]]
*Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation, U.S. -based research institute at the University of Michigan (Founded in 2011, IHPI includes smaller centers focused on specific healthcare topics)
*[[Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics]], U.S.-based center for HSR at the University of Pennsylvania

Think Tank or Professional Society Sponsored
*[[Society of General Internal Medicine]], U.S.-based professional organization in internal medicine research
*[[Commonwealth Fund]], U.S.-based center for HSR
* Rand Corporation Health Division, U.S.-based center for HSR

==United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (UK)==
Several governmental agencies exist that sponsor or support HSR, with their remits set by central and devolved governments.  These include the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) and its constitiuent infrastructure (including the CLAHRC programme)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NIHR National Institute for Health Research|url=https://www.nihr.ac.uk/|website=www.nihr.ac.uk|language=EN}}&lt;/ref&gt;; Healthcare Improvement Scotland&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Healthcare Improvement Scotland|url=http://www.healthcareimprovementscotland.org/|website=www.healthcareimprovementscotland.org|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;; Health and Care Research Wales&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Health and Care Research Wales|url=https://www.healthandcareresearch.gov.wales/|website=www.healthandcareresearch.gov.wales|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;; and Health and Social Care Research and Development&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HSC Research and Development www.research.hscni.net HSC Public Health Agency|url=http://www.publichealth.hscni.net/directorate-public-health/hsc-research-and-development|website=www.publichealth.hscni.net|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Many universities have HSR units, a web search can find these with relative ease.

==Canada==
Several government, academic and non-government agencies conduct or sponsor health services research, notably the [[Canadian Institute for Health Information]] and the [[Canadian Institutes of Health Research]] (i.e. the third pillar: "research respecting health systems and services"). 

Others include the [[Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences]] (ICES) in [[Toronto]], and the [[Canadian Collaborative Study of Hip Fractures]].

The '''Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set''' ('''HEDIS''') is a widely used set of [[Performance measurement|performance measures]] in the [[managed care]] industry, developed and maintained by the [[National Committee for Quality Assurance]] (NCQA).

HEDIS was designed to allow consumers to compare health plan performance to other plans and to national or regional benchmarks. Although not originally intended for trending, HEDIS results are increasingly used to track year-to-year performance. HEDIS is one component of NCQA's [[Professional certification|accreditation]] process, although some plans submit HEDIS data without seeking accreditation. An incentive for many health plans to collect HEDIS data is a [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] (CMS) requirement that [[health maintenance organization]]s (HMOs) submit [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] HEDIS data in order to provide HMO services for Medicare enrollees under a program called [[Medicare (United States)#Part C: Medicare Advantage plans|Medicare Advantage]].

HEDIS was originally titled the "[[HMO]] Employer Data and Information Set" as of version 1.0 of 1991.&lt;ref name=Mainous1998&gt;Mainous AG 3rd, Talbert J. [http://archfami.ama-assn.org/cgi/reprint/7/5/410.pdf Assessing quality of care via HEDIS 3.0. Is there a better way?] Arch Fam Med 1998 Sep-Oct;7(5):410-3. Accessed 2009 Apr 28.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1993, Version 2.0 of HEDIS was known as the "Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set".&lt;ref&gt;Schauffler HH, Rodriguez T. [http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/reprint/15/1/73.pdf Exercising purchasing power for preventive care.] Health Aff (Millwood) 1996 Spring;15(1):73-85. Accessed 2009 Apr 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Version 3.0 of HEDIS was released in 1997.&lt;ref name=Mainous1998/&gt; In July 2007, NCQA announced that the meaning of "HEDIS" would be changed to "Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set."&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncqa.org/tabid/517/Default.aspx Measures assessing resource use highlight HEDIS 2008] (news release). Washington, D.C.: National Committee for Quality Assurance, 2007 Jul 11. Accessed 2009 Apr 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

In current usage, the "reporting year" after the term "HEDIS" is one year following the year reflected in the data; for example, the "HEDIS 2009" reports, available in June 2009, contain analyses of data collected from "measurement year" January–December 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncqa.org/Portals/0/PublicComment/HEDIS2010/NCQA_HEDIS_2010_Public_Comment_Overview.pdf HEDIS 2010 public comment overview.] Washington, D.C.: National Committee for Quality Assurance, 2009. Accessed 2009 Apr 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The 83 HEDIS measures are divided into five "domains of care":&lt;ref&gt;http://blackboard.fresnocitycollege.edu/courses/1/HIT-12-26552-2013SP/content/_1882003_1/HIT%2012%20article%20C4%20MCO%20Data.PDF&gt;WhatIsHEDIS&gt;[http://www.ncqa.org/tabid/187/Default.aspx What is HEDIS?] Washington, D.C.: National Committee for Quality Assurance. Accessed 2009 Apr 25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=2009SummaryTable&gt;[http://www.ncqa.org/Portals/0/HEDISQM/HEDIS2009/2009_Measures.pdf HEDIS 2009 summary table of measures, product lines and changes.] Washington, D.C.: National Committee for Quality Assurance, 2008. Accessed 2009 Apr 25.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Effectiveness of Care
*Access/Availability of Care
*Experience of Care
*Utilization and Relative Resource Use
*Health Plan Descriptive Information

Measures are added, deleted, and revised annually. For example, a measure for the length of stay after giving birth was deleted after legislation mandating minimum length of stay rendered this measure nearly useless. Increased attention to medical care for seniors prompted the addition of measures related to [[glaucoma]] screening and [[osteoporosis]] treatment for older adults. Other health care concerns covered by HEDIS are [[Immunization (medicine)|immunizations]], [[cancer]] screenings, treatment after [[heart attacks]], [[diabetes]], [[asthma]], [[flu vaccine|flu shots]], access to services, [[dentistry|dental care]], alcohol and drug dependence treatment, timeliness of handling phone calls, prenatal and postpartum care, [[mental health]] care, well-care or preventive visits, inpatient utilization, drug utilization, and distribution of members by age, sex, and product lines.

New measures in HEDIS 2013 are “Asthma Medication Ratio,”  “Diabetes Screening for People With Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder Who Are Using Antipsychotic Medications,” “Diabetes Monitoring for People With Diabetes and Schizophrenia,” “Cardiovascular Monitoring for People With Cardiovascular Disease and Schizophrenia,” and “Adherence to Antipsychotic Medications for Individuals With Schizophrenia.”{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

==Data collection==
HEDIS data are collected through [[Statistical survey|surveys]], [[medical record|medical charts]] and [[insurance claim]]s for hospitalizations, medical office visits and procedures. Survey measures must be conducted by an NCQA-approved external survey organization. Clinical measures use the '''administrative''' or '''hybrid''' data collection methodology, as specified by NCQA. '''Administrative''' data are electronic records of services, including insurance claims and registration systems from hospitals, clinics, medical offices, pharmacies and labs.  For example, a measure titled Childhood Immunization Status requires health plans to identify 2 year old children who have been enrolled for at least a year. The plans report the percentage of children who received specified immunizations.  Plans may collect data for this measure by reviewing insurance claims or automated immunization records, but this method will not include immunizations received at community clinics that do not submit insurance claims. For this measure, plans are allowed to select a random sample of the population and supplement claims data with data from medical records. By doing so, plans may identify additional immunizations and report more favorable and accurate rates. However, the hybrid method is more costly, time-consuming and requires [[nurses]] or medical record reviewers who are authorized to review confidential medical records.

==Reporting==
HEDIS results must be audited by an NCQA-approved auditing firm for public reporting. NCQA has an on-line reporting tool called Quality Compass that is available for a fee of several thousand dollars. It provides detailed data on all measures and is intended for employers, consultants and insurance brokers who purchase health insurance for groups. NCQA's web site includes a summary of HEDIS results by health plan. NCQA also collaborates annually with U.S. News &amp; World Report to rank HMOs using an index that combines many HEDIS measures and accreditation status. The "Best Health Plans" list is published in the magazine in October and is available on the magazine's web site. Other local business organizations, governmental agencies and media report HEDIS results, usually when they are released in the fall.

== Advantages and disadvantages ==
{{procon|date=November 2012}}

===Advantages===
Proponents cite the following advantages of HEDIS measures:

* HEDIS measures undergo a selection process that has been described as "rigorous"&lt;ref name=IOM2001&gt;Institute of Medicine.

Accessed 2009 May 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(p.&amp;nbsp;205)&lt;/sup&gt;. Steps in the process include assessment of a measure's "importance, scientific soundness and feasibility"; field testing; public comment; a one-year trial period in which results are not reported publicly; and evaluation of publicly reported measures by "statistical analysis, review of audit results and user comments".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncqa.org/tabid/425/Default.aspx HEDIS life cycle.] Washington, D.C.: National Committee for Quality Assurance. Accessed 2009 May 6.&lt;/ref&gt;
* HEDIS data are useful for "evaluating current performance and setting goals".&lt;ref name=Scanlon2001&gt;Scanlon DP, Darby C, Rolph E, Doty HE.

Accessed 2009 Apr 28.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In some studies, attainment of HEDIS measures is associated with cost-effective practices or with better health outcomes.
** In a 2002 study, HEDIS measures "generally reflect[ed] cost-effective practices".&lt;ref name=Neumann2002&gt;Neumann PJ, Levine BS. [http://www.ajpm-online.net/article/S0749-3797(02)00516-0 Do HEDIS measures reflect cost-effective practices?] Am J Prev Med 2002 Nov;23(4):276-89. Accessed 2009 May 6.&lt;/ref&gt;
** A 2003 study of Medicare managed care plans determined that plan-level health outcomes were associated with HEDIS measures.&lt;ref&gt;Ware J, Rogers W, Gandek B, Haffer SC, Bierman AS, Kang JL.

Accessed 2009 May 6.&lt;/ref&gt;
* As stated in a 2006 [[Institute of Medicine]] (IOM) report, "HEDIS measures focus largely on processes of care";&lt;ref name=IOM2006&gt;Institute of Medicine. [http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=11517 Performance measurement: accelerating improvement.] Washington, DC: National Academies Press; 2006. {{ISBN|978-0-309-10007-6}}. Accessed 2009 Apr 28.&lt;/ref&gt; the strengths of process measures include the facts that they "reflect care that patients actually receive," thereby leading to "buy-in from providers," and that they are "directly actionable for quality improvement activities"&lt;ref name=IOM2006/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(p.&amp;nbsp;179)&lt;/sup&gt;.
* HEDIS measures are "widely known and accepted"&lt;ref name=IOM2001/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(p.&amp;nbsp;205)&lt;/sup&gt;. The NCQA claims that over 90% of U.S. health plans use HEDIS measures.&lt;ref name=WhatIsHEDIS&gt;[http://www.ncqa.org/tabid/187/Default.aspx What is HEDIS?] Washington, D.C.: National Committee for Quality Assurance. Accessed 2009 Apr 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disadvantages OF HEDIS===
HEDIS was described in 1995 as "very controversial".&lt;ref name=Epstein1995&gt;Epstein A. [http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/extract/333/1/57 Performance reports on quality--prototypes, problems, and prospects.] N Engl J Med. 1995 Jul 6;333(1):57-61. Accessed 2009 Apr 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Criticisms of HEDIS measures have included:

* HEDIS measures do not account for many important aspects of health care quality.  They count only a select set of healthcare interventions, for specific at risk patient populations, that can imply that institutions and Providers are giving adequate care.  Its purpose is to verify a minimally acceptable level of care is given to specific At Risk Populations.
** In 1998, HEDIS measures were said to "offer little insight into... [a health] plan’s ability to treat serious illnesses".&lt;ref&gt;Mainous AG 3rd, Talbert J. [http://archfami.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/7/5/410 Assessing quality of care via HEDIS 3.0. Is there a better way?] Arch Fam Med 1998 Sep-Oct;7(5):410-3. Accessed 2009 May 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  But, no current studies or evidence can be offered to support this and HEDIS compliance measures are updated yearly to reflect best Practices in healthcare.
**A 2002 study found "there are numerous non-HEDIS interventions with some evidence of cost effectiveness, particularly interventions to promote healthy behaviors".&lt;ref name=Neumann2002/&gt;  This may speak more to the specificity of defined healthcare Best Practices interventions to At Risk Populations than to anecdotal interventions with "some evidence".  Measures are revised every year to include newer and even more effective Best Practice Guidelines.
** According to a 2005 study, HEDIS-Medicaid 3.0 measures covered only 22% of the services recommended by the second [[U.S. Preventive Services Task Force]] (USPSTF).&lt;ref&gt;Levine RS, Briggs NC, Husaini BA, Foster I, Hull PC, Pamies RJ, Tropez-Sims S, Emerson JS. [http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/journal_of_health_care_for_the_poor_and_underserved/v016/16.4Alevine.html HEDIS prevention performance indicators, prevention quality assessment and Healthy People 2010.] J Health Care Poor Underserved 2005 Nov;16(4 Suppl A):64-82. Accessed 2009 May 6.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Though without studies, without expressing what interventions and without reporting what "harm", some groups believe attempts by health care providers to improve their HEDIS measures may cause harm to patients.  They have not offered any solutions.
** As of 2001, there was concern that the asthma HEDIS measure may "encourag[e] more casual prescribing of controller medications" and may place emphasis "on the prescribing of a controller medication rather than on its actual use".&lt;ref&gt;Glauber JH. [http://www.ajmc.com/media/pdf/AJMC2001junGlauber575_579.pdf Does the HEDIS asthma measure go far enough?] Am J Manag Care 2001;7:575-579. Accessed 2009 May 6.&lt;/ref&gt;
** There is a risk of hypoglycemia if a provider strives to meet the HEDIS measure concerning a [[Glycosylated hemoglobin|hemoglobin A1c]] (HbA1c) level of &lt;7% that was adopted in 2006 for HEDIS 2007.&lt;ref name=Aron2009&gt;Aron D, Pogach L. [http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/extract/301/2/210 Transparency standards for diabetes performance measures.] JAMA 2009 Jan 14;301(2):210-2. Accessed 2009 May 6.&lt;/ref&gt; NCQA later decided to not report results of the HbA1c&lt;7% measure publicly in 2008, to modify the HbA1c&lt;7% measure for HEDIS 2009 "by adding exclusions for members within a specific age cohort and with certain comorbid conditions," and to add a new HbA1c&lt;8% measure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncqa.org/Portals/0/PolicyUpdates/HEDIS%20Technical%20Updates/2009_Vol2_Technical_Update.pdf HEDIS 2009, volume 2: technical update.] Washington, D.C.: National Committee for Quality Assurance, 2008 Oct 1. Accessed 2009 May 6.&lt;/ref&gt;
** There is a possible [[conflict of interest]] because NCQA "works closely with the managed-care industry".&lt;ref name=Epstein1995/&gt;  Furthermore, approximately half of NCQA's budget is derived from accreditation fees, "which may create an incentive against setting [HEDIS] standards too high".&lt;ref&gt;Kuttner R. [http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/extract/338/22/1635 Must good HMOs go bad? Second of two parts. The search for checks and balances.] N Engl J Med 1998 May 28;338(22):1635-9. Accessed 2009 May 6.&lt;/ref&gt;
** The process to develop the measures is not completely "transparent," that is, "information about existing conditions, decisions and actions" is not completely "accessible, visible and understandable”.&lt;ref name=Aron2009/&gt;
* In some cases, attainment of HEDIS measures is not proven to be associated with better health outcomes.  But, no evidence or studies can be offered.
** In 2004, a multi-site study determined that persons with persistent asthma per the HEDIS definition at the time had more "asthma-related adverse events" if they were classified by HEDIS as having appropriate asthma therapy than if they did not have appropriate therapy.&lt;ref name=Berger2004&gt;Berger WE, Legorreta AP, Blaiss MS, Schneider EC, Luskin AT, Stempel DA, Suissa S, Goodman DC, Stoloff SW, Chapman JA, Sullivan SD, Vollmer B, Weiss KB.

Accessed 2009 May 7.&lt;/ref&gt; This cause of this "unexpected" finding was thought to be that some people with intermittent asthma were miscategorized by HEDIS as having persistent asthma.&lt;ref name=Berger2004/&gt;
** A 2008 study of 1056 adults with asthma found that "compliance with the HEDIS asthma measure is not favorably associated with relevant patient-oriented outcomes" such as scores on an Asthma Control Test.&lt;ref&gt;Lim KG, Patel AM, Naessens JM, Li JT, Volcheck GW, Wagie AE, Enders FB, Beebe TJ.

** Although "[[glaucoma]] screening in older adults" is a current HEDIS measure,&lt;ref name=2009SummaryTable/&gt; the USPSTF found "insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening adults for glaucoma" in 2005;&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF).

Accessed 2009 May 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, a 2006 [[Cochrane Collaboration|Cochrane]] review ("last assessed as up-to-date" in 2009) concluded that there was "insufficient evidence to recommend population based screening" for glaucoma because no pertinent randomized controlled trials exist.&lt;ref&gt;Hatt SR, Wormald R, Burr J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1189">'''Hydrocolpos''' is the distension of the [[vagina]] caused by accumulation of fluid due to congenital [[vaginal obstruction]]. The obstruction is often caused by an [[imperforate hymen]] or less commonly a [[transverse vaginal septum]]. The fluid consists of [[cervix|cervical]] and [[endometrium|endometrial]] [[mucus]] or in rare instances [[urine]] accumulated through a [[vesicovaginal fistula]] proximal to the obstruction. In some cases, it is associated with [[Bardet–Biedl syndrome|Bardet-Biedl Syndrome.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/bardet-biedl-syndrome/|title=Bardet-Biedl Syndrome - NORD (National Organization for Rare Disorders)|work=NORD (National Organization for Rare Disorders)|access-date=2017-12-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; If it occurs in [[prepubertal]] girls, it may show up as abdominal swelling. It may be detected by using ultrasound. It may also present at birth as a distended lower abdomen and vagina. It also associated with [[vaginal atresia]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18094">'''Infant and toddler safety''' are those actions and modifications put into place to keep babies and toddlers safe from accidental injury and death. Many accidents, injuries and deaths are preventable.&lt;ref name = aapfurn&gt;{{cite web | publisher = American Academy of Pediatrics | first = Lois| last = Lee| url = https://www.aap.org/en-us/aap-voices/Pages/How-a-Hole-in-the-Wall-Can-Save-a-Childs-Life.aspx | title = How a Hole in the Wall Can Save a Child's Life | date = 6 July 2017| accessdate = 27 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Infants begin to crawl around six to nine months of age. When they crawl, they are exposed to many dangers. Anticipating the development of the baby and toddler aids caregivers in identifying hazards before they are discovered by the child.&lt;ref name=NIH2017&gt;{{cite web|title=Making Your Home Safe For Baby|url=https://www.womenshealth.gov/pregnancy/getting-ready-baby/making-your-home-safe-baby|publisher = Office on Women’s Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services|accessdate=17 July 2017|date=1 February 2017}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General recommendations==
US government agencies recommend that caregivers take the following precautions:

* Covering all unused electrical sockets with outlet plugs.
* Keeping cords out of baby's reach. Tack up cords to vertical blinds and move furniture, lamps, or electronics to hide cords.
* Securing furniture and electronics, such as bookcases and TVs, so they cannot be pulled down on top of the baby.
* Using protective padding to cover sharp edges and corners, such as from a coffee table or fireplace hearth.
* Installing safety gates at the bottom and top of stairwells or to block entry to unsafe rooms.
* Using safety latches on cabinets and doors.
* Storing all medicines, cleaning products, and other poisons out of the baby's reach.
* Removing rubber tips from doorstops or replace with one-piece doorstops.
* Looking for and removing all small objects. Objects that easily can pass through the center of a toilet paper roll might cause choking.
* Keeping houseplants out of the baby's reach. Some plants can poison or make your babies sick.
* Setting the water heater temperature to no higher than 125 degrees Fahrenheit. Water that is hotter can cause bad burns.
* Closely supervising the baby around pets. Even family pets have been know to harm familiar children.&lt;ref name=NIH2017/&gt;

==Furniture==
Toddlers typically enjoy [[climbing]] up things with steps. This includes [[furniture]]. Heavy furniture in the home is often not secured to the wall. These pieces of furniture can include [[bookcase]]s and [[dressing table|dressers]] that can weigh hundreds of pounds. Heavy objects like televisions that are on the furniture can also fall onto the child. If the toddler climbs up the furniture it is likely to fall onto the child. This has resulted in the deaths and injuries of children. Even if the children appears uninjured, it is possible that [[internal injuries]] have occurred with serious consequences. Often these injuries are not apparent to caregivers and as a consequence treatment can be delayed. Serious head injuries have also occurred.&lt;ref name = aapfurn/&gt;

Caregivers can prevent accidents related to furniture by securring the furniture to the wall. Placing heavier objects into the lowest drawers. Not placing toys on top of the furniture. Constantly monitoring the activities of the toddler. Putting drawer stops onto the drawers to prevent the toddler from opening the drawer. Mount flat-screen televisions out-of-reach and onto the wall.&lt;ref name = aapfurn/&gt;

==Lead poisoning==
{{See|Lead poisoning}}
No safe levels of lead in the body of a child is considered safe and can cause problems for the rest of their life.&lt;ref name=CDC2012&gt;{{cite web|title=Advisory Committee On Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention (ACCLPP)|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/lead/ACCLPP/acclpp_main.htm|publisher=CDC|accessdate=18 May 2012|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children living in low-income families are more likely to have levels of lead in their bodies.

==Child abuse==
{{Main | Child abuse}}
It is important that caregivers recognize the potential of the abuse of their infant or toddler. An infant or toddler is potentially vulnerable to [[physical abuse]], [[sexual abuse]], [[psychological abuse]] and [[neglect]] and has inability to verbalize the details of the abuse.&lt;ref name=AIFSWhat&gt;{{cite web |title=What is Child Abuse and Neglect? |publisher=Australian Institute of Family Studies |url=https://aifs.gov.au/cfca/publications/what-child-abuse-and-neglect |date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Child grooming]] can be a concern and occurs when a perpetrator wins the trust of caregivers for the purpose of creating an opportunity for them to sexually abuse an infant or toddler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pandys.org/articles/sexualabusegrooming.html|title=Child Sexual Abuse and the "Grooming" Process|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sanderson"&gt;{{cite book|author=Christiane Sanderson|title=

Those who care for infants and toddlers may benefit from stress reduction. Becoming educated on normal child development can help someone understand that crying is a normal thing for babies and toddlers, especially if they hungry or need a diaper change. Caregivers can contact another person who is willing to give them a break. Those who are drinking alcohol are more likely to injure the infant or toddler. Carefully choosing someone else to watch the infant or toddler can also reduce the risk of injury.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.healthychildren.org/English/safety-prevention/at-home/Pages/Abusive-Head-Trauma-Shaken-Baby-Syndrome.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

==Car accidents==
{{See|Child safety seat}}
Children under the age of 3 were 43% are less likely to be injured in a car crash if their car seat was placed in the center of the car. The center position is the safest but the least used position.&lt;ref name=Levitt&gt;[http://www.ted.com/talks/steven_levitt_on_child_carseats.html Lecture by Levitt at TED] Retrieved June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hyperthermia and hypothermia==
[[File:Icy pond in Struie Wood - geograph.org.uk - 1055578.jpg|thumb|Even a very small icy pond can be hazardous for a toddler]]
Forgetting that an infant or toddler is in the car and leaving them where they are exposed to high temperatures can result in death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=March 26, 2009 |title=The Last Word: Forgotten Baby Syndrome |journal=The Week |url=http://www.theweek.com/article/index/94741/The_last_word_Forgotten_baby_syndrome}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Toddlers can wander off and fall through ice or be left out in cool or cold weather and experience hypothermia. This low body temperature is often fatal but instances of survival after a near drowning occur.Of all drowning deaths in 2013, 82,000 occurred in children less than five years old.&lt;ref name=GDB2013&gt;{{cite journal|last1=GBD 2013 Mortality and Causes of Death|first1=Collaborators|title=Global, regional, and national age-sex specific all-cause and cause-specific mortality for 240 causes of death, 1990-2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 |journal=Lancet|date=17 December 2014 |pmid=25530442 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(14)61682-2 |pmc=4340604 |volume=385 |pages=117–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drowning==
Toddlers have wandered off and drowned in ponds.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thestate.com/news/local/article160945674.html&lt;/ref&gt; Toddlers can easily drown in small, shallow ornamental ponds.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lehighvalleylive.com/news/index.ssf/2017/06/toddler_dies_after_being_found.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://fox40.com/2017/07/05/babysitter-of-toddler-found-in-koi-pond-to-be-arraigned/&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Five gallon bucket 20080716.jpg|thumb|left|This five gallon bucket comes with a warning that it can be filled with fluid and an infant can drown.]]

==Animal attacks==
{{See|Dog bite prevention}}
An infant or toddler is more likely than other family members to be injured by an animal because they cannot defend themselves and are lower to the ground. Familiar family pets with no prior history of aggression are more likely to attack the child than unfamiliar pets from other households.

==Choking==
Toddlers and infants who can hold objects can choke when a small object is inhaled and blocks the trachea.

Babywipes (diaper wipes) can be a choke hazard

==Poisoning==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2722">'''The inverse care law''' is the principle that the availability of good medical or social care tends to vary inversely with the need of the population served. Proposed by [[Julian Tudor Hart]] in 1971, the term has since been widely adopted. It is a [[pun]] on [[inverse-square law]], a term and concept from [[physics]].

The law states that:

''"The availability of good medical care tends to vary inversely with the need for it in the population served. This ... operates more completely where medical care is most exposed to market forces, and less so where such exposure is reduced."'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hart|first1=Julian Tudor|title=The Inverse Care Law|url=http://www.sochealth.co.uk/resources/public-health-and-wellbeing/poverty-and-inequality/the-inverse-care-law/|website=Socialist Health Association|accessdate=1 April 2015|date=27 April 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hart later paraphrased his argument: "To the extent that health care becomes a commodity it becomes distributed just like champagne. That is rich people gets lots of it. Poor people don’t get any of it."

The Inverse Care Law is a key issue in the debate about [[health inequality]].  As [[Frank Dobson]] put it when he was [[Secretary of State for Health]]: "Inequality in health is the worst inequality of all. There is no more serious inequality than knowing that you'll die sooner because you're badly off."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=GOVT TAKES ACTION TO REDUCE HEALTH INEQUALITIES|url=http://www.lgcplus.com/govt-takes-action-to-reduce-health-inequalities/1494985.article|accessdate=21 December 2013|newspaper=Local Government Chronicle|date=12 August 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the co-founder and the first President (1960–1971) of the [[World Academy of Art and Science]] (WAAS).{{sfn|Cuthbertson|2007|pp=1–5}}{{sfn|ODNB|2004}}&lt;ref name="npg"&gt;{{NPG name|id=08505|name=John Boyd Orr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and family background ==
[[File:Boydorrshouse.JPG|left|thumb|200px|The birthplace of Lord Boyd Orr: Holland Green, Fenwick Road, Kilmaurs.]]
John Boyd Orr was born at [[Kilmaurs]], near [[Kilmarnock]], [[East Ayrshire]], [[Scotland]], the middle child in a family of seven children. His father, Robert Clark Orr, was a quarry owner, and a man of deep religious convictions, being a member of the [[Free Church of Scotland (1843–1900)|Free Church of Scotland]]. His mother, Annie Boyd, was the daughter of another quarry master, wealthier than Robert Orr, and grandmaster of a [[Masonic Lodge|Freemason's Lodge]].

The family home was well supplied with books, and his father was widely read in political, sociological and metaphysical subjects, as well as religion. As he grew older, John would regularly discuss these subjects with his father, brothers, and visiting friends.{{efn|Kay is silent on whether his mother and sisters were also involved in these discussions}} There was also family worship each evening.

When John was five years old, the family suffered a setback when a ship owned by Robert Orr was lost at sea. They had to sell their home in [[Kilmaurs]], and moved to [[West Kilbride]], a village on the [[North Ayrshire]] coast. According to Kay, the new house and environment were a great improvement on Kilmaurs, despite the family's reduced means. The major part of his upbringing took place in and around West Kilbride. He attended the village school until he was thirteen. Religion was then an important part of junior education in Scotland, and the school gave him a good knowledge of the [[Bible]], which stayed with him for the rest of his life.{{sfn|Kay|1972|p=44}}

At the age of thirteen, John won a bursary to [[Kilmarnock Academy]], a significant achievement as such bursaries were then rare. The new school was some {{convert|20|mi|km}} from his home in West Kilbride, but his father owned a quarry about two miles (3&amp;nbsp;km) from the Academy, and John was provided with accommodation nearby. His family cut short his education at the Academy because he was spending too much time in the company of the quarry workers (where he picked up a "wonderful vocabulary of swear words"),{{sfn|Kay|1972|p=44}} and after four months he returned to the village school in West Kilbride where he continued his education until he was seventeen under the inspirational tutelage of Headmaster John G. Lyons. There he became a pupil teacher at a salary of £10 for the first year, and £20 for the second. This was a particularly demanding time for the young Boyd Orr, as in addition to his teaching duties, and studying at home for his university and teacher-training qualifications, he also had to work every day in his father's business.{{sfn|Kay|1972|p=44}}

After four years as a pupil teacher, at the age of 19 he won a Queen's Scholarship to study at a teacher training college in [[Glasgow]], plus a bursary which paid for his lodgings there. At the same time he entered a three-year degree course in [[theology]]{{sfn|Encyclopædia Britannica|2007}}{{efn|but theology may or may not have been the subject in which he received his M.A. degree}} at the [[University of Glasgow|University]], for which the fees were also covered.

== First encounters with poverty ==
As an undergraduate in Glasgow, he explored the interior of the city, usually at weekends. He was shocked by what he found in the poverty-stricken slums and tenements, which then made up a large part of the city. [[Rickets]] was obvious among the children, malnutrition (in some cases, associated with drunkenness) was shown by many of the adults, and many of the aged were destitute. In his first teaching job after graduating [[Master of Arts (Scotland)|M.A.]] in 1902, he was posted to a school in the slums. His first class was overcrowded, and the children ill-fed or actually hungry, inadequately clothed, visibly lousy and physically wretched. He resigned after a few days, realising that he could not teach children in such a condition, and that there was nothing he could do to relieve their misery.{{sfn|Kay|1972|p=46}}

After working for a few months in his father's business, he taught for three years at Kyleshill School in [[Saltcoats]], also a poor area, but less squalid than the slums of [[Glasgow]].

== Return to university ==
Boyd Orr needed to augment his teacher's salary, and decided to do so by instructing an evening class in book-keeping and accountancy. After intensive study he passed the necessary examinations, and duly instructed his class. The knowledge and skills he learned by studying for, and teaching, this class were to prove very useful in his later career.

However his heart was not in teaching, and after fulfilling his teaching obligations under the terms of his Queen's Scholarship, he returned to the University to study [[biology]], a subject he had always been interested in since childhood. As a precaution, he entered simultaneously for a degree in [[medicine]].

He found the university to be a very stimulating environment. [[Diarmid Noel Paton]] (son of the artist [[Joseph Noel Paton]]) was Regius Professor of Physiology, and [[Edward Provan Cathcart]] head of [[Physiological chemistry|Physiological Chemistry]], both men of outstanding scientific ability. He was impressed by Samuel Gemmill, Professor of Clinical Medicine, a philosopher whose deep thinking on social affairs also influenced Boyd Orr's approach to such questions.{{sfn|Kay|1972|p=46}}

Half-way through his medical studies, his savings ran out. Reluctant to ask his family for support, he bought a block of tenanted flats on mortgage, with the help of a bank overdraft, and used the rents to pay for the rest of his studies. On graduating, he sold the property for a small profit.

He graduated [[B.Sc.]] in 1910, and [[Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery|M.B. Ch.B.]] in 1912, at the age of 32, placing sixth in a year of 200 students. Two years later, in 1914, he graduated [[Doctor of Medicine#UK, Ireland and some Commonwealth countries|M.D.]] with honours, receiving the Bellahouston Gold Medal for the most distinguished thesis of the year.

== Research career ==
On leaving the university, he took a position as a ship's surgeon on a ship trading between Scotland and West Africa, choosing this job because it offered the possibility of paying off his bank overdraft faster than any other. He resigned after four months, when he had repaid the debt. He then tried general practice, working as a ''[[locum]]'' in the practice of his family doctor in [[Saltcoats]], and was offered a partnership there. Realising that a career in medicine was not for him, he instead accepted the offer of a two-year Carnegie research scholarship, to work in [[Edward Provan Cathcart|E.P. Cathcart]]'s laboratory. The work he began there covered [[malnutrition]], [[protein]]{{sfn|Cathcart|Orr|1914|pp=113–127}} and [[creatine]]{{sfn|Cathcart|Boyd Orr|1914|pp=xxi–xxii}}{{sfn|Boyd Orr|1914}} [[metabolism]], the effect of water intake on [[nitrogenous]] metabolism in humans,{{sfn|Boyd Orr|Burns|1914}}{{sfn|Orr|1914|pp=530–540}} and the energy expenditure of military recruits in training.{{sfn|Boyd Orr|Cathcart|1919}}

=== The beginnings of the Rowett Research Institute ===
On 1 April 1914, Boyd Orr took charge of a new research institute in [[Aberdeen]], a project of a joint committee for research into animal nutrition of the [[Scottish Agricultural College|North of Scotland College of Agriculture]] and [[University of Aberdeen|Aberdeen University]]. He had been offered the post on the recommendation of E.P. Cathcart, who had originally been offered the job, but had turned it down in favour of a chair in [[physiology]] in [[University of London|London]].

The joint committee had allocated a budget of £5,000 for capital expenditure and £1,500 for annual running costs. Boyd Orr recognised immediately that these sums were inadequate. Using his experience in his father's business of drawing up plans and estimating costs, he submitted a budget of £50,000 for capital expenditure and £5,000 for annual running costs. Meanwhile, with the £5,000 he had already been allocated he specified a building, not of wood as had been envisaged by the committee, but of granite and designed so that it could serve as a wing of his proposed £50,000 Institute. He accepted the lowest tender of £5,030, and told the contractors to begin work immediately. The committee were not pleased, but had to accept the ''[[fait accompli]]''. When war broke out the contractors were told to finish the walls and roof, but to do no more for the time being.

=== War service ===
On the outbreak of the [[World War I|First World War]] he was given leave to join the [[British Army]], and asked his former colleague Cathcart to help him obtain a medical commission in an infantry unit overseas. Cathcart thought he would be more useful at home, and his first commission was in a special civilian section of the [[Royal Army Medical Corps|R.A.M.C.]] dealing with sanitation. Several divisions of non-conscripted recruits were in training in emergency camps at home, some of them in very poor sanitary conditions. Boyd Orr was able to push through schemes for improvement in hygiene, preventing much sickness.{{sfn|Kay|1972|p=49}}

After 18 months he was posted as [[Medical officer|Medical Officer]] to an infantry unit, the [[The Sherwood Foresters (Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Regiment)|1st Sherwood Foresters]]. He spent much of his time in shell holes, patching up the many wounded. His courage under fire and devotion to duty were recognised by the award of a [[Military Cross]] after the [[Battle of the Somme]], and of the [[Distinguished Service Order]] after [[Battle of Passchendaele|Passchendaele]]. He also made arrangements for the battalion's diet to be supplemented by vegetables collected from local deserted gardens and fields. As a result, unlike other units, he did not need to send any of the men in his medical charge to hospital. He also prevented his men getting [[trench foot]] by personally ensuring they were fitted with boots a size larger than usual.{{sfn|Kay|1972|p=49}}

Worried that he was losing touch with medical and nutritional advances, he asked to be transferred to the [[Royal Navy|navy]], where he thought he would have more time available for reading and research. The army was reluctant to let him go, but agreed, since he was still a civilian surgeon. He spent a busy three months in the naval hospital at [[Chatham Dockyard|Chatham]], studying hard while practicing medicine in the wards, before being posted to [[HMS Furious (47)|HMS ''Furious'']]. On board ship his medical duties were light, enabling him to do a great deal of reading. He was later recalled to work studying food requirements of the army.

=== Post-war expansion of the Rowett Research Institute ===
When Boyd Orr returned to Aberdeen in early 1919, his plan for a larger Institute had still not been accepted. Indeed, even his plans for the annual maintenance grant had to be approved by the Professor of Agriculture in [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], Thomas Barlow Wood. Despite gaining the latter's support, his expansion plans were at first rebuffed, although he succeeded in having the annual grant increased to £4,000. In 1920 he was introduced to [[John Quiller Rowett]], a businessman who seemed to have qualms of conscience{{sfn|Kay|1972|p=51}} over the large profits he had made during the war. Shortly afterwards, the government agreed to finance half the cost of Boyd Orr's plan, provided he could raise the other half elsewhere. Rowett agreed to provide £10,000 for the first year, £10,000 for the second year, and gave an additional £2,000 for the purchase of a farm, provided that, "if any work done at the Institute on animal nutrition was found to have a bearing on human nutrition, the Institute would be allowed to follow up this work",{{sfn|RRI|2005}} a condition the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]] was willing to accept. By September 1922 the buildings were nearly completed, and the renamed [[Rowett Research Institute]] was opened shortly thereafter by [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]].{{sfn|Kay|1972|p=52}}

Boyd Orr proved to be an effective fund-raiser from both government and private sources,{{sfn|Smith|1998|pp=47–63}} expanding the experimental farm to around {{convert|1000|acre|km2}}, building a well-endowed library, and expanding the buildings. He also built a centre for accommodating students and scientists attracted by the Institute's growing reputation, a reputation enhanced by Boyd Orr's many publications.{{sfn|Kay|1972|p=54}} His research output suffered from the time and energy he had to devote to fund-raising, and in later life he said, "I still look with bitter resentment at having to spend half my time in the humiliating job of hunting for money for the Institute."{{sfn|Kay|1972|p=52}}

Through the 1920s, his own research was devoted mainly to animal nutrition, his focus changed to human nutrition both as a researcher and an active lobbyist and propagandist for improving people's diets. In 1927, he proved the value of milk being supplied to school children, which led to free school milk provision in the UK. His 1936 report "Food, Health and Income" showed that at least one third of the UK population were so poor that they could not afford to buy sufficient food to provide a healthy diet and revealed that there was a link between low-income, malnutrition and under-achievement in schools.{{sfn|UoG}}

From 1929 to 1944, Boyd Orr was Consultant Director to the Imperial Bureau of Animal Nutrition, later the Commonwealth Bureau of Nutrition (part of the [[CAB International|Commonwealth Agricultural Bureaux]]), which was based at the Rowett Research Institute. During the Second World War he was a member of Churchill's Scientific Committee on Food Policy and helped to formulate food rationing{{sfn|UoG}}

== International and political work ==
In October 1945, Orr was elected [[Rector of the University of Glasgow]] after standing as an Independent Progressive candidate.{{sfn|''The Glasgow Herald'' 22 Oct|1945|p=4}} He was elected as an independent [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for the [[Combined Scottish Universities (UK Parliament constituency)|Combined Scottish Universities]] in a [[Combined Scottish Universities by-election, 1945|by-election in April 1945]],{{sfn|''The Glasgow Herald'' 14 Apr|1945|p=10}} and kept his seat at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|general election]] shortly after. He [[resignation from the British House of Commons|resigned]] in 1946.{{sfn|''The Glasgow Herald'' 4 Oct|1946|p=4}}

After the [[Second World War]], Boyd Orr resigned from the Rowett Institute, and took several posts, most notably as Director-General of the United Nations' new Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).{{sfn|''The Glasgow Herald'' 28 Oct|1945|p=3}}{{sfn|''The Glasgow Herald'' 1 Dec|1945|p=2}} Although his tenure in this position was short (1945–1948), he worked not only to alleviate the immediate postwar food shortage through the International Emergency Food Committee (IEFC) but also to propose comprehensive plans for improving food production and its equitable distribution—his proposal to create a World Food Board.  Although the board failed to get the support of Britain and the US, Boyd Orr laid a firm foundation for the new U.N. specialized agency.{{sfn|Staples|2006|pp=78–96}}{{sfn|Staples|2003|pp=495–523}}

He then resigned from the FAO and became director of a number of companies and proved a canny investor in the stock market, making a considerable personal fortune.  When he received the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1949,{{efn|The [[American Friends Service Committee]] was one of his nominators for the Nobel Prize.{{sfn|AFSC Nobel Nominations}}}} he donated the entire financial award to organizations devoted to world peace and a united world government.
He was elevated to the peerage in 1949 as '''Baron Boyd Orr''', of Brechin Mearns in the County of Angus.{{sfn|Kay|1972|pp=43–81}}&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=38558 |date=11 March 1949 |page=1264}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960 Boyd Orr was elected the first president of the [[World Academy of Art and Science]], which was set up by eminent scientists of the day concerned about the potential misuse of scientific discoveries, most especially nuclear weapons.

The [[University of Glasgow]] has a [[Boyd Orr Building]] and the Boyd Orr Centre for Population and Ecosystem Health{{sfn|Boyd Orr Centre}} named after him, and the University's [[Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery|Hunterian Museum]] holds his Nobel medal. There is a street named after Boyd Orr in his home town of Kilmaurs in Ayrshire, as well as in [[Brechin]], Angus, [[Penicuik]], Midlothian, and in [[Saltcoats]], Ayrshire.

{{UK-centric|date=May 2016}}

[[File:Icos Laboratories.JPG|thumb|right|Laboratories around the world depend on a LIMS to manage data, assign rights, manage inventory, and more.]]
A '''laboratory information management system''' ('''LIMS'''), sometimes referred to as a '''laboratory information system''' ('''LIS''') or '''laboratory management system''' ('''LMS'''), is a [[software]]-based solution with features that support a modern laboratory's operations. Key features include—but are not limited to—[[workflow]] and data tracking support, flexible architecture, and data exchange interfaces, which fully "support its use in regulated environments". The features and uses of a LIMS have evolved over the years from simple [[Sample (material)|sample]] tracking to an [[enterprise resource planning]] tool that manages multiple aspects of  [[laboratory informatics]].

The definition of a LIMS is somewhat controversial: LIMSs are dynamic because the laboratory's requirements are rapidly evolving and different labs often have different needs.  Therefore, a working definition of a LIMS ultimately depends on the interpretation by the individuals or groups involved.&lt;ref name="Cramer"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sapiosciences.com/news/What-is-a-LIMS-/ |title=What is a LIMS? |author=Cramer, Kevin |publisher=sapiosciences.com |date=28 November 2016 |accessdate=28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically the LIMS, LIS, and [[process development execution system]] (PDES) have all performed similar functions.  The term "LIMS" has tended to refer to [[informatics]] systems targeted for environmental, research, or commercial analysis such as pharmaceutical or petrochemical work. "LIS" has tended to refer to [[laboratory informatics]] systems in the forensics and clinical markets, which often required special case management tools.  "PDES" has generally applied to a wider scope, including, for example, virtual manufacturing techniques, while not necessarily integrating with [[laboratory equipment]].

In recent times LIMS functionality has spread even farther beyond its original purpose of sample management. [[Assay]] data management, [[data mining]], data analysis, and [[electronic laboratory notebook]] (ELN) integration have been added to many LIMS, enabling the realization of [[translational medicine]] completely within a single software solution. Additionally, the distinction between LIMS and LIS has blurred, as many LIMS now also fully support comprehensive case-centric clinical data.

Up  until the late 1970s, the management of laboratory samples and the associated analysis and reporting were time-consuming manual processes often riddled with [[transcription error]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s. This gave some organizations impetus to streamline the collection of data and how it was reported.  Custom in-house solutions were developed by a few individual laboratories, while some enterprising entities at the same time sought to develop a more commercial reporting solution in the form of special instrument-based systems.&lt;ref name="LIMSHistory"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Laboratory Automation and Information Management |year=1996 |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=1–5 |title=A brief history of LIMS |author=Gibbon, G.A.|doi=10.1016/1381-141X(95)00024-K |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/1381141X9500024K |format=PDF |accessdate=7 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982 the first generation of LIMS was introduced in the form of a single centralized minicomputer, which offered laboratories the first opportunity to utilize automated reporting tools. As the interest in these early LIMS grew, industry leaders like Gerst Gibbon of the [[National Energy Technology Laboratory|Federal Energy Technology Center]] in Pittsburgh began planting the seeds through LIMS-related conferences. By 1988 the second-generation commercial offerings were tapping into [[relational database]]s to expand LIMS into more application-specific territory, and International LIMS Conferences were in full swing. As [[personal computers]] became more powerful and prominent, a third generation of LIMS emerged in the early 1990s. These new LIMS took advantage of  [[client/server architecture]], allowing laboratories to implement better data processing and exchanges.&lt;ref name="LIMSHistory" /&gt;

By 1995 the client/server tools had developed to the point of allowing processing of data anywhere on the network. Web-enabled LIMS were introduced the following year, enabling researchers to extend operations outside the confines of the laboratory. From 1996 to 2002 additional functionality was included in LIMS, from [[wireless networking]] capabilities and [[Georeference|georeferencing]] of samples, to the adoption of [[XML]] standards and the development of Internet purchasing.&lt;ref name="LIMSHistory" /&gt;

As of 2012, some LIMS have added additional characteristics that continue to shape how a LIMS is defined.  Additions include clinical functionality, [[electronic laboratory notebook]] (ELN) functionality, as well a rise in the [[software as a service]] (SaaS) distribution model.

==Technology==

===Operations===

The LIMS is an evolving concept, with new features and functionality being added often. As laboratory demands change and technological progress continues, the functions of a LIMS will likely also change. Despite these changes, a LIMS tends to have a base set of functionality that defines it. That functionality can roughly be divided into five laboratory processing phases, with numerous software functions falling under each:&lt;ref name="MT5310"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Measurement Techniques |year=2011 |volume=53 |issue=10 |pages=1182–1189 |title=Laboratory information management systems in the work of the analytic laboratory |author1=D. O. Skobelev |author2=T. M. Zaytseva |author3=A. D. Kozlov |author4=V. L. Perepelitsa |author5=A. S. Makarova |doi=10.1007/s11018-011-9638-7 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/6564211m773v70j1/ |format=PDF |accessdate=7 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
(1) the reception and log in of a [[Sample (material)|sample]] and its associated customer data, 
(2) the assignment, scheduling, and tracking of the sample and the associated analytical workload, 
(3) the processing and quality control associated with the sample and the utilized equipment and inventory, 
(4) the storage of data associated with the sample analysis, 
(5) the inspection, approval, and compilation of the sample data for reporting and/or further analysis.

There are several pieces of core functionality associated with these laboratory processing phases that tend to appear in most LIMS:

====Sample management====

[[File:Lab worker with blood samples.jpg|thumb|right|A lab worker matches blood samples to documents. With a LIMS, this sort of sample management is made more efficient.]]
The core function of LIMS has traditionally been the management of samples. This typically is initiated when a sample is received in the laboratory, at which point the sample will be registered in the LIMS. Some LIMS will allow the customer to place an "order" for a sample directly to the LIMS at which point the sample is generated in an "unreceived" state. The processing could then include a step where the sample container is registered and sent to the customer for the sample to be taken and then returned to the lab. The registration process may involve [[accession number (bioinformatics)|accessioning]] the sample and producing [[barcode]]s to affix to the sample container. Various other parameters such as clinical or [[Phenotype|phenotypic]] information corresponding with the sample are also often recorded. The LIMS then tracks chain of custody as well as sample location. Location tracking usually involves assigning the sample to a particular freezer location, often down to the granular level of shelf, rack, box, row, and column. Other event tracking such as freeze and thaw cycles that a sample undergoes in the laboratory may be required.

Modern LIMS have implemented extensive configurability as each laboratory's needs for tracking additional data points can vary widely. LIMS vendors cannot typically make assumptions about what these data tracking needs are, and therefore vendors must create LIMS that are adaptable to individual environments. LIMS users may also have regulatory concerns to comply with such as [[CLIA]], [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|HIPAA]], [[Good Laboratory Practice|GLP]], and [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] specifications, affecting certain aspects of sample management in a LIMS solution. One key to compliance with many of these standards is audit logging of all changes to LIMS data, and in some cases a full [[electronic signature]] system is required for rigorous tracking of field-level changes to LIMS data.

====Instrument and application integration====

Modern LIMS offer an increasing amount of integration with laboratory instruments and applications. A LIMS may create control files that are "fed" into the instrument and direct its operation on some physical item such as a sample tube or sample plate. The LIMS may then import instrument results files to extract data for quality control assessment of the operation on the sample. Access to the instrument data can sometimes be regulated based on chain of custody assignments or other security features if need be.

Modern LIMS products now also allow for the import and management of raw assay data results.&lt;ref name="LBAssays"&gt;{{cite book |title=Ligand-Binding Assays: Development, Validation, and Implementation in the Drug Development Arena |author1=Khan, Masood N. |author2=Findlay, John W. |chapter=11.6 Integration: Tying It All Together |year=2009 |page=324 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QzM0LUMfdAkC |isbn=0470041382 |accessdate=7 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern targeted assays such as qPCR and deep [[sequencing]] can produce tens of thousands of data points per sample. Furthermore, in the case of drug and diagnostic development as many as 12 or more assays may be run for each sample. In order to track this data, a LIMS solution needs to be adaptable to many different assay formats at both the data layer and import creation layer, while maintaining a high level of overall performance. Some LIMS products address this by simply attaching assay data as [[Binary large object|BLOB]]s to samples, but this limits the utility of that data in data mining and downstream analysis.

====Electronic data exchange====

The exponentially growing volume of data created in laboratories, coupled with increased business demands and focus on profitability, have pushed LIMS vendors to increase attention to how their LIMS handles [[Electronic Data Interchange|electronic data exchanges]]. Attention must be paid to how an instrument's input and output data is managed, how remote sample collection data is imported and exported, and how mobile technology integrates with the LIMS. The successful transfer of data files in spreadsheets and other formats is a pivotal aspect of the modern LIMS. In fact, the transition "from proprietary databases to standardized database management systems such as MySQL" has arguably had one of the biggest impacts on how data is managed and exchanged in laboratories. In addition to mobile and database electronic data exchange, many LIMS support real-time data exchange with [[Electronic Health Records]] used in core hospital or clinic operations.

====Additional functions====

Aside from the key functions of sample management, instrument and application integration, and electronic data exchange, there are numerous additional operations that can be managed in a LIMS. This includes but is not limited to:

; [[audit]] management
: fully track and maintain an audit trail
; [[barcode]] handling
: assign one or more data points to a barcode format; read and extract information from a barcode
; chain of custody
: assign roles and groups that dictate access to specific data records and who is managing them
; compliance
: follow regulatory standards that affect the laboratory
; customer relationship management
: handle the demographic information and communications for associated clients
; document management
: process and convert data to certain formats; manage how documents are distributed and accessed
; instrument [[calibration]] and maintenance
: schedule important maintenance and calibration of lab instruments and keep detailed records of such activities
; inventory and equipment management
: measure and record inventories of vital supplies and laboratory equipment
; manual and electronic data entry
: provide fast and reliable interfaces for data to be entered by a human or electronic component
; method management
: provide one location for all laboratory process and procedure (P&amp;P) and methodology to be housed and managed as well as connecting each sample handling step with current instructions for performing the operation
; personnel and workload management
: organize work schedules, workload assignments, employee demographic information, training, and financial information
; quality assurance and control
: gauge and control sample quality, data entry standards, and [[workflow]]
; reports
: create and schedule reports in a specific format; schedule and distribute reports to designated parties
; time tracking
: calculate and maintain processing and handling times on chemical reactions, workflows, and more
; traceability
: show audit trail and/or chain of custody of a sample
; workflows
: track a sample, a batch of samples, or a "lot" of batches through its lifecycle

===Client-side options===

A LIMS has utilized many architectures and distribution models over the years. As technology has changed, how a LIMS is installed, managed, and utilized has also changed with it. The following represents architectures which have been utilized at one point or another.

====Thick-client====
A thick-client LIMS is a more traditional client/server architecture, with some of the system residing on the computer or workstation of the user ([[Client (computing)|the client]]) and the rest on the server. The LIMS software is installed on the client computer, which does all of the data processing. Later it passes information to the server, which has the primary purpose of data storage. Most changes, upgrades, and other modifications will happen on the client side.

This was one of the first architectures implemented into a LIMS, having the advantage of providing higher processing speeds (because processing is done on the client and not the server). Additionally, thick-client systems have also provided more interactivity and customization, though often at a greater learning curve. The disadvantages of client-side LIMS include the need for more robust client computers and more time-consuming upgrades, as well as a lack of base functionality through a [[web browser]]. The thick-client LIMS can become web-enabled through an add-on component.&lt;ref name="SciComp"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rdmag.com/article/2008/08/selecting-right-lims |title=Selecting the Right LIMS: Critiquing technological strengths and limitations |author=O'Leary, Keith M. |publisher=Scientific Computing |accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there is a claim of improved security through the use of a thick-client LIMS,&lt;ref name="SciComp" /&gt; this is based on the misconception that "only users with the client application installed on their PC can access server side information". This secrecy-of-design reliance is known as [[security through obscurity]] and ignores an adversary's ability to mimic client-server interaction through, for example, [[reverse engineering]], [[Packet analyzer|network traffic interception]], or simply purchasing a thick-client license. Such a view is in contradiction of the "Open Design" principle of the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]]'s ''Guide to General Server Security'' which states that "system security should not depend on the secrecy of the implementation or its components",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guide to General Server Security|url=http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/nistpubs/800-123/SP800-123.pdf|publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology|date=July 2008|accessdate=2 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which can be considered as a reiteration of [[Kerckhoffs's principle]].

====Thin-client====
&lt;!-- linked from redirect [[Web based LIMS]] --&gt;
A [[Thin client|thin-client]] LIMS is a more modern architecture which offers full application functionality accessed through a device's web browser. The actual LIMS software resides on a server (host) which feeds and processes information without saving it to the user's hard disk. Any necessary changes, upgrades, and other modifications are handled by the entity hosting the server-side LIMS software, meaning all end-users see all changes made. To this end, a true thin-client LIMS will leave no "footprint" on the client's computer, and only the integrity of the web browser need be maintained by the user. The advantages of this system include significantly lower cost of ownership and fewer network and client-side maintenance expenses. However, this architecture has the disadvantage of requiring real-time server access, a need for increased network throughput, and slightly less functionality. A sort of hybrid architecture that incorporates the features of thin-client browser usage with a thick client installation exists in the form of a web-based LIMS.

Some LIMS vendors are beginning to rent hosted, thin-client solutions as "[[software as a service]]" (SaaS). These solutions tend to be less configurable than on-premises solutions and are therefore considered for less demanding implementations such as laboratories with few users and limited sample processing volumes.

Another implementation of the thin client architecture is the maintenance, [[warranty]], and support (MSW) agreement. Pricing levels are typically based on a percentage of the license fee, with a standard level of service for 10 concurrent users being approximately 10 hours of support and additional customer service, at a roughly $200 per hour rate. Though some may choose to opt out of an MSW after the first year, it's often more economical to continue the plan in order to receive updates to the LIMS, giving it a longer life span in the laboratory.

====Web-enabled====
A web-enabled LIMS architecture is essentially a thick-client architecture with an added web browser component. In this setup, the client-side software has additional functionality that allows users to interface with the software through their device's browser. This functionality is typically limited only to certain functions of the web client. The primary advantage of a web-enabled LIMS is the end-user can access data both on the client side and the server side of the configuration. As in a thick-client architecture, updates in the software must be propagated to every client machine. However, the added disadvantages of requiring always-on access to the host server and the need for cross-platform functionality mean that additional overhead costs may arise.

==== Web-based ====
A web-based LIMS architecture is a hybrid of the thick- and thin-client architectures. While much of the client-side work is done through a web browser, the LIMS may also require the support of desktop software installed on the client device. The end result is a process that is apparent to the end-user through a web browser, but perhaps not so apparent as it runs thick-client-like processing in the background. In this case, web-based architecture has the advantage of providing more functionality through a more friendly web interface. The disadvantages of this setup are more sunk costs in system administration and reduced functionality on mobile platforms.

The disadvantage of a thick client is in the installation and update phases of the applications. Users who want the security, high speed and functionality of a thick client may use Microsoft [[ClickOnce]] Technology.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}  This enables the user to install and run a Windows-based smart client application by clicking a link in a web page.  The software does not need to be installed at each user workstation one by one.  ClickOnce applications can be self-updating; they can check for newer versions as they become available and automatically replace any updated files.

=== Configurability ===
LIMS implementations are notorious for often being lengthy and costly. This is due in part to the diversity of requirements within each lab, but also to the inflexible nature of most LIMS products for adapting to these widely varying requirements.  Newer LIMS solutions are beginning to emerge that take advantage of modern techniques in software design that are inherently more configurable and adaptable — particularly at the data layer — than prior solutions.  This means not only that implementations are much faster, but also that the costs are lower and the risk of obsolescence is minimized.

==Distinction between a LIMS and a LIS==
Until recently, the LIMS and Laboratory Information System (LIS) have exhibited a few key differences, making them noticeably separate entities.

A LIMS traditionally has been designed to process and report data related to batches of samples from [[biology]] labs, [[Sewage treatment|water treatment facilities]], [[Clinical trial|drug trials]], and other entities that handle complex batches of data. A LIS has been designed primarily for processing and reporting data related to individual patients in a clinical setting.

A LIMS may need to satisfy [[good manufacturing practice]] (GMP) and meet the reporting and audit needs of the regulatory bodies and research scientists in many different industries. A LIS, however, must satisfy the reporting and auditing needs of health service agencies e.g. the hospital accreditation agency, [[HIPAA]] in the US, or other clinical medical practitioners.

A LIMS is most competitive in group-centric settings (dealing with "batches" and "samples") that often deal with mostly anonymous research-specific laboratory data, whereas a LIS is usually most competitive in patient-centric settings (dealing with "subjects" and "specimens") and clinical labs. An LIS is regulated as a medical device by the FDA, and the companies that produce the software are therefore liable for defects. Due to this, an LIS can not be customized by the client.

==Standards==
A LIMS covers standards such as [[Title 21 CFR Part 11|21 CFR Part 11]] from the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)]], [[ISO/IEC 17025]], 
[[ISO 15189]], 
[[good laboratory practice]], and 
[[Good Automated Manufacturing Practice]] (GAMP).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3473">'''Mandated choice''' or '''mandatory choice''' is an approach to public policy questions in which people are required by law to state in advance whether or not they are willing to engage in a particular action.  The approach contrasts with "opt-in" and "opt-out" ("presumed consent") models of policy formation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/health-news/2008/10/27/remedying-donor-organ-complications-91466-22122353/ Remedying donor organ complications]&lt;/ref&gt;  The approach has most frequently been applied to cadaveric organ donation,&lt;ref&gt;Herz, Susan.  Two Steps to Three Choices: A New Approach to Mandated Choice, ''Cambridge Quarterly of Healthcare Ethics'' (1999), 8 : 340-347 Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; but has increasingly been considered for [[advance directives]] as well.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"&gt;Appel, Jacob M.  [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jacob-m-appel/the-ultimate-prescription_b_247558.html The Ultimate Prescription: Make Us Decide How We Want To Die], July 30, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  One bioethicist, in advocating for a mandatory choice model for [[living wills]], argues that "while all Americans should have a right to decide how they want their lives to end, it does not follow that they should be able to avoid confronting such a choice."&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"/&gt;

==History==

One of the first considerations of mandated choice appeared in [[Great Britain]]'s Gore Report, a 1989-1990 study funded by the British Department of Health. From 2011 all those applying for or renewing driving licences online in the UK are required to state whether they wished to donate their organs.&lt;ref&gt;Organ donated 'nudge' for drivers in new DVLA process, BBC, July 31, 2011 [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-14341553, accessed July 31, 2011].&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Medical Association]] endorsed a mandated choice model for organ donation in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Taking organs without asking, Chicago Tribune, July 18, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practicalities==
It has been suggested that individuals could be compelled to choose as part of tax returns, driver's licence applications, and/or state benefits claims.&lt;ref&gt;Chouhan P and H Draper.  Modified Mandated Choice for Organ Procurement  ''J Med Ethics''. 2003;29(3):157-162, at p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public attitudes==

A 1992 survey found that 90% of American college students favored a mandated choice model for organ donation, compared with only 60% who favored presumed consent.&lt;ref&gt;Spital, Aaron.  Mandated Choice:  The Preferred Solution to the Organ Shortage?  ''Arch Intern Med''. 1992;152(12):2421-2424.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Texas implemented such a program, requiring drivers to make a choice on organ donation when obtaining licenses, and found that 80% of drivers declined to donate.&lt;ref&gt;Kolata, Gina.  Families Are Barriers to Many Organ Donations, Study Finds.  ''The New York Times'', July 7, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic debate==
Chouhan and Draper propose a modified scheme of mandated choice, in which though all patients are given a choice whether to donate they are actively encouraged to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Chouhan P and H Draper.  Modified Mandated Choice for Organ Procurement  ''J Med Ethics''. 2003;29(3):157-162, at p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9666">'''Mental Health Awareness Month''' (also referred to as "Mental Health Month") has been observed in May in the United States since 1949,  reaching millions of people in the [[United States]] through the media, local events, and screenings.&lt;ref name="MHA_May"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.mentalhealthamerica.net/may | title=May is Mental Health Month | accessdate=2014-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mental Health Awareness Month was started in the United States in 1949 by the [[Mental Health America]] organization (then known as the National Association for Mental Health). Each year in mid-March Mental Health America releases a ''toolkit of materials'' to guide preparation for outreach activities during Mental Health Awareness Month. During the month of May, Mental Health America, its affiliates, and other organizations interested in mental health conduct a number of activities which are based on a different theme each year.

Themes from recent years include:
{| class="wikitable"
!Year
!Theme
!Description
|-
|2018
|Fitness #4Mind4Body
|The 2018 theme was Fitness #4Mind4Body. It tracks closely with the Fit for the Future theme of the June 2018 conference. During the month of May, it focused on what individuals can do to be fit for their own futures – no matter where they happen to be on personal journeys to health and wellness.
|-
|2017
|Risky Business
|The 2017 theme for Mental Health Month was ''Risky Business. It focused on the importance to educate people about habits and behaviors that increase the risk of developing or exacerbating mental illnesses, or ''could be signs of mental health problems themselves''. These include risk factors such as risky sex, prescription drug misuse, internet addiction, excessive spending, marijuana use, and troublesome exercise patterns.
|-
|2016
|Mental Illness Feels Like
|The 2016 theme for Mental Health Month was - ''Life with a Mental Illness'' - and called on individuals to share what life with a mental illness feels like for them in words, pictures and video by tagging their social media posts with #mentalillnessfeelslike (or submitting to MHA anonymously).

The campaign intends to encourage people to speak up about their own experiences, to share their point of view with individuals who may be struggling to explain what they are going through—and help others figure out if they too are showing signs of a mental illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mentalhealthamerica.net/may-mental-health-month-life-mental-illness|title=Mental Health America Press Release|last=Wallace|first=Erin|date=May 1, 2016|work=|access-date=August 25, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|2015
|B4Stage4
|The 2015 theme for Mental Health Awareness month was ''B4Stage4''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mentalhealthamerica.net/b4stage4|title=Mental Health America|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;" Addressing mental health before Stage 4 calls attention to the importance addressing mental health symptoms early, identifying potential underlying diseases, and planning an appropriate course of action on a path towards overall health. One way of doing so is by taking a mental health screening - a free, confidential, anonymous questionnaire - to assess symptoms and risk factors for mental health conditions.
|-
|2014
|Mind Your Health
|The theme for the 2014 Mental Health Awareness month was “Mind Your Health”. A focus of that year's theme was to create a motivational effort that will put toward the goal of building public recognition in regards to the importance of mental health and to the overall health and wellness of those around us. The association hopes to inform United States citizens of the connection between the mind and body; and intends to provide advice, tips and strategies that will encourage people to take positive actions and protective measures for one’s own mental health, and whole-body health.&lt;ref name="MHA_May" /&gt;
|-
|2013
|Pathways to Wellness
|Pathways to Wellness—the 2013 theme for Mental Health Awareness Month—called attention to strategies and approaches that help all Americans achieve wellness and good mental and overall health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mentalhealthamerica.net/may-mental-health-month-calls-attention-pathways-wellness|title=Mental Health America Press Release|last=Vetzner|first=Steve|date=April 22, 2013|work=|access-date=August 25, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|2012
|Healing Trauma's Invisible Wounds
|The 2012 theme - Healing Trauma's Invisible Wounds - aimed to bring to light the many sources of trauma, its profound health effects, the cost  to trauma survivors and society, and new hope for healing.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Mental Health America Press Release Archives&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
|2011
|Do More for 1 in 4
|The 2011 theme - Do More for 1 in 4 - was based on a 2005 NIMH statistic indicating that as many as 1 in 4 American adults had a diagnosable mental health condition in a given year.  The theme acted as a  call to action for Americans to help the 1 in 4 American adults in their lives who are living with a diagnosable, treatable mental health condition, and was used to highlight treatment and recovery programs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
|-
|2010
|Live Your Life Well
|In 2010, the theme was 'Live Your Life Well'.&lt;ref name="Vetzner"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mentalhealthamerica.net/may-mental-health-month-calls-attention-pathways-wellness|title=May is Mental Health Month; Calls Attention to Pathways to Wellness|last=Vetzner|first=Steve|work=Mental Health America|accessdate=1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'Live Your Life Well' was a theme designed to encourage people to take responsibility for the prevention of mental health issues during times of personal challenge and stress. The message was to inform the public that many mental health problems could be avoided by striving toward and making positive lifestyle choices in the ways we act and think.&lt;ref name="Vetzner" /&gt;
|-
|2009
|Live Your Life Well
|'Live Your Life Well' was a theme designed to encourage people to take responsibility for the prevention of mental health issues during times of personal challenge and stress. The message was to inform the public that many mental health problems could be avoided by striving toward and making positive lifestyle choices in the ways we act and think.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
|-
|2008
|Get Connected
|The 2007 theme focused on an essential component of maintaining and protecting mental health and wellness: social connectedness. Materials encouraged discussion of the many ways of creating connections that support mental health and well-being, including: family, friends and others that form an individual’s social support network; the community at-large; and health care professionals, when needed.

The 2008 campaign aimed to: increase recognition that mental health is fundamental to overall health and well-being; increase awareness of the role of social connectedness in promoting mental health and protecting mental health during times of adversity, particularly when one is experiencing significant life stressors; and increase recognition of the signs and symptoms of mental health conditions, with an emphasis on stress and depression, and the importance of connecting with a health care provider early.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
|}
Its purpose is to raise awareness and educate the public about: mental illnesses, such as the 18.1% of Americans who suffer from &lt;ref&gt;https://adaa.org/about-adaa/press-room/facts-statistics&lt;/ref&gt; [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[schizophrenia]], and [[bipolar disorder]]; the realities of living with these conditions; and strategies for attaining mental health and wellness. It also aims to draw attention to [[suicide]], which can be precipitated by some mental illnesses.  Additionally, Mental Health Awareness Month strives to reduce the stigma (negative attitudes and misconceptions) that surrounds mental illnesses.  The month came about by presidential proclamation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/04/30/presidential-proclamation-national-mental-health-awareness-month-2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Mental Health America is not the only organization to run campaigns throughout May. Many other similar organizations choose to host awareness observances that coincide with Mental Health Awareness month. National Children's Mental Health Awareness Day is one such campaign. This event is sponsored by the [[Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration]] in partnership with other non-profit and advocacy organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.samhsa.gov/children/national-events|title=SAMHSA|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other months and weeks throughout the year are designated to raise awareness around specific mental health conditions or the mental health of different demographic groups (Minority Mental Health Month, Mental Illness Awareness Week, National Depression Screening Day, etc.).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5295">A '''mental health consumer''' (or mental health patient) is a person who is obtaining treatment or support for a [[mental disorder]], also known as psychiatric or mental illness. The term was coined by people who use mental health services  in an attempt to empower those with [[mental health]] issues, usually considered a [[Marginalization|marginalized]] segment of society. The term suggests that there is a reciprocal contract between  those  who provide a service and those who use a service and that individuals have a choice in their treatment and that without them there could not exist [[mental health provider]]s.

==History==

In the 1970s the term "patient" was most commonly used.  Mental Health activists of the civil rights times recognized, as did many other groups seeking self-definition, that such labels are metaphors that reflect how identities are perceived and constructed (McDonald 206). In particular, in the mental health field they shape the nature of the relationship between the giver and receiver of psychiatric services, be it one with an emphasis on reciprocity or hierarchy (McLaughlin 2007). Users of psychiatric services repulsed the efforts of experts to define them and sought to develop ways to define themselves (Morrison 2000). In Australia, informal support groups of people who had recovered from episodes of mental ill health were formed during the first wave  of moving patients out of psychiatriic hospitals into the community in the 1960s. In the USA and other countries, radical movements to change service delivery and legislation began to be driven by consumers during the 1980s. Activists, such as Judi Chamberlain, pressed for alternatives to psychiatrist dominated and controlled systems of mental health provision. Chamberlain's On Our Own: Patient Controlled Alternatives to the Mental Health System (Chamberlain 1978) helped guide others intent on a more collaborative form of mental health healing.

In the 1980s with some funding from NIMH, small experimental groups flourished. In 1985 at the  First Alternatives Conference attendees agreed upon the term "consumer" reflecting the patients' choice of services (Bluebird). The term also implied assumptions of rationality and ability to make choices in one's own best interests rather than be a passive incapacitated recipient of "expert" attention (McDonald 2006). 
In the 1990s many consumer groups were formed, such as Self Help Clearing House and the National Empowerment Center. They continued to press for more peer involvement in alternatives treatments, pointing out that peers support and comfort, in contrast to therapists who attempt to change the behavior and thinking patterns of consumers (Bluebird).

==Contemporary Usage==

Today, the word mental health consumer has expanded in the popular usage of consumers themselves to include anyone who has received mental health services in the past, anyone who has a behavioral health diagnosis, or simply anyone who has experienced a mental or behavioral disorder.  Other terms sometimes used  by members of this community  for empowerment through positive [[self-identification]] include "peers," "people with mental health disabilities," "psychiatric survivors," "users," individuals with "lived experience" and "ex-patients." (See the [[Psychiatric survivors movement]] for more information). The term "service users," is commonly used in the U.K. In the U.S. "consumer" is most frequently used by ex-patients and users of psychiatric and alternative services.

One can view this term, "consumer," neutrally as a person who receives psychological services, perhaps from a psychologist, a psychiatrist or a social worker. It can be impersonal term relating to the  use in the health sector of a large economy. It suggests that the consumer  expects to have some influence on service delivery and provides feedback 
to the provider.  Used in its more activist sense, consumer groups aim to correct perceived problems in mental health services and to promote consultation with consumers. Consumer theory was devised to interpret the special relationship between a service provider and service user in the context of mental health. Consumer theory examines the consequences and sociological meaning of the relationship.

Distinct from [[pathology]], moral injury is a normal human response to an abnormal traumatic event.&lt;ref name="RitaNakashima"&gt;Rita Nakashima and Gabriella Lettini, Soul Repair: Recovering from Moral Injury After War (Boston: Beacon Press, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; The concept is currently used in literature with regard to the mental health of military veterans who have witnessed or perpetrated an act in combat that transgressed their deeply held moral beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ptsd.va.gov/professional/co-occurring/moral_injury_at_war.asp|title = Moral Injury in the Context of War|date = |accessdate = December 13, 2015|website = PTSD: National Center for PTSD|publisher = U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs|last = Maguen|first = Shira|first2 = Brett|last2 = Litz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|edition = 1st|title = Beyond PTSD: The Moral Casualties of War|publisher = Gnosis Press|date = 2016-01-01|isbn = 9780996820714|language = English|first = Camillo Mac|last = Bica|first2 = Claude AnShin|last2 = Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moral injury can also be experienced by those who have been transgressed against. For example, when one goes to war believing that the purpose of the war is to eradicate weapons of mass destruction, but finds that not to be the case, the warrior can experience moral injury due to a sense of betrayal. Those who have seen and experienced death, mayhem, destruction, and violence and have had their worldviews shattered – the sanctity of life, safety, love, health, peace, etcetera – can also suffer moral injury. This injury can also occur in the medical space – among physicians and other emergency or first responder care providers who engage in traumatic high impact work environments which can affect their mental health and well-being.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.statnews.com/2018/07/26/physicians-not-burning-out-they-are-suffering-moral-injury/|title=Physicians aren't 'burning out.'

== Development of moral injury ==
The term ‘moral injury’ (also abbreviated ‘MI’) was first coined by psychiatrist professor [[Jonathan Shay]] and colleagues based upon numerous narratives presented by military/veteran patients given their perception of injustice as a result of leadership malpractice. Shay’s definition of moral injury had three components: ‘Moral injury is present when (i) there has been a betrayal of what is morally right, (ii) by someone who holds legitimate authority and (iii) in a high-stakes situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Shay, J., &amp; Munroe, J.

To understand the development of the construct of moral injury, it is necessary to examine the history of violence and the psychological consequences. Throughout history, humans have been killing each other, and have shown great reluctance in doing so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grossman|first=Dave|date=2009|title=On combat: the psychology and physiology of deadly conflict in war and in peace|url=|journal=Illinois: Warrior Science Pub|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Literature on warfare emphasizes the moral anguish soldiers feel in combat, from modern military service members to ancient warriors.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brock|first=Rita|date=2013|title=Soul repair: Recovering from moral injury after war|url=|journal=The Right to Heal: Holding the US Accountable for the Human Costs of War|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethical and moral challenges are expected from warfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blinka|first=Dee|date=2016|title=Moral injury in warriors and veterans: The challenge to social work|url=|journal=Social Work &amp; Christianity|volume=43 | issue = 3 |pages=7–27|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soldiers in the line of duty may witness catastrophic suffering and severe cruelty, causing their fundamental beliefs about humanity and their worldview to be shaken.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Litz|first=Brett|date=2009|title=Moral injury and moral repair in war veterans: A preliminary model and intervention strategy|url=|journal=Clinical Psychology Review|volume=2 | issue = 8 |pages=695–706|via=|doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2009.07.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has begun to look at the concept of moral injury to understand the impact that combat may have on soldiers, and their mental health afterwards. Currently, no systematic reviews or meta-analyses exist on the construct of moral injury – although a literature review of the various definitions since the inception of moral injury has been undertaken.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Hodgson, T. J., &amp; Carey, L. B. (2017). Moral injury and definitional clarity: Betrayal, spirituality and the role of chaplains. Journal of Religion and Health, 56(4), 1212-1228.|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10943-017-0407-z|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the literature reflects that moral injury was developed as a response to the inadequacy of mental health diagnoses to encapsulate the moral anguish service members were experiencing after returning home from war.&lt;ref name="ncbi" /&gt;  Service members who are deployed into war zones are usually exposed to death, injury, and violence. Military service members represent the population with the highest risk of developing posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (4th ed., text rev.)|last=American Psychiatric Association|first=|publisher=Washington, D.C.: Author|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; PTSD was first included in the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the manual classifying mental health disorders published by the American Psychiatric Association, to begin to address the symptoms that Vietnam veterans exhibited after their wartime experiences.&lt;ref name="ncbi" /&gt; As PTSD has developed as a diagnosis, it requires that individuals are either directly exposed to death, threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence, witness it in person, learn about it occurring indirectly to a close relative or friend, or are repeatedly exposed to aversive details of traumatic events.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; PTSD includes four symptom clusters, including intrusion, avoidance, and negative mood and thoughts, and changes in arousal and reactivity.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Individuals with PTSD may experience intrusive thoughts as they re-experience the traumatic events, as well as avoiding stimuli that reminds them of the traumatic event, and have increasingly negative thoughts and moods. Additionally, individuals with PTSD may exhibit irritable or aggressive, self-destructive behavior, and hypervigilance, amongst other arousal-related symptoms.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

While these symptoms can have devastating effects, in the first review of moral injury, Litz and co-authors argued that service members may experience long-term pain and suffering stemming from their time in combat that is not encapsulated or represented by a diagnosis of PTSD. Unlike PTSD’s focus on fear-related symptoms, moral injury focuses on symptoms related to guilt, shame, anger, and disgust.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Farnsworth|first=Jacob|date=2014|title=The role of moral emotions in military trauma: Implications for the study and treatment of moral injury|url=|journal=Review of General Psychology |volume=18 | issue = 4 |pages=249–262|via= |doi=10.1037/gpr0000018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A diagnosis of PTSD in the DSM-III listed an individual experiencing guilt for behaviors that required for their survival as a symptom. However, conceptualizations of PTSD in each subsequent DSM has dropped guilt as a symptom.

With the inability of current diagnoses to account for moral anguish, research has begun to search to encapsulate moral conflict in warriors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Drescher|first=Kent|date=2011|title=An exploration of the viability and usefulness of the construct of moral injury in war veterans|url=|journal=Traumatology|volume=17 | issue = 1 |pages=8013|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase ‘moral injury’ (originally defined by Jonathan Shay &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Shay|title=Professor Jonathan Shay|last=|first=|date=|website=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Shay|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was modified by Brett Liz and colleagues (2009) as “perpetrating, failing to prevent, or bearing witness to acts that transgress deeply held moral beliefs and expectations may be deleterious in the long term, emotionally, psychologically, behaviorally, spiritually, and socially" (p.&amp;nbsp;695). Treating moral injury is often thought of as “soul repair” due to the nature of moral anguish.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As someone wrestles with the impact of what they did, failed to do, or witnessed, it can seem like their entire guiding principles for life have been altered or removed. The consequences of moral injury can be disastrous. An individual with a moral injury can experience severe distress, including major depression, and suicidality.&lt;ref name="ncbi" /&gt; While moral injury can be experienced by people other than military service members, current research has paid special attention to moral injury in military populations.&lt;ref name="ncbi" /&gt;

== Military culture ==
Although moral injury does not only exist among military populations, the exposure to violence that occurs during war times make military and veteran population at a higher risk of developing moral injury. It has been reported that 32% of service members deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan were responsible for the death of an enemy and 60% stated that they had witnessed both women and children who were either ill or wounded that they were unable to provide aid to.&lt;ref name="ncbi" /&gt; Additionally, 20% reported being responsible for the death of a non-combatant.&lt;ref name="ncbi" /&gt; These statistics were taken in 2003 and an updated survey of the number of service members who have been directly responsible for the death of an enemy, a non-combatant, or having to leave sick and wounded women and children behind can shed light onto the magnitude of the issue of moral injury among service members.

During times of war a service member’s personal ethical code may clash with what is expected of them during war. Approximately 27% of deployed soldiers have reported having an ethical dilemma to which they did not know how to respond.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gaudet|first=Camille|last2=Sowers|date=2016|title=A review of PTSD and shame in military veterans|url=|journal=Journal of Human Behavior in the Social Environment|volume=26 | issue = 1 |pages=56–68|via=|doi=10.1080/10911359.2015.1059168}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has shown that longer and more frequent deployments can result in an increase in unethical behaviors on the battlefield.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Mental Health Advisory Team (MHAT-IV). (2006, November 17). Operation Iraqi Freedom 05-   07. Retrieved December 18, 2008, from             &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.armymedicine.army.mil/reports/mhat/mhat_iv/mhat-iv.cfm&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This is problematic considering deployment lengths have increased for the war in Iraq and Afghanistan.&lt;ref name="ncbi" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; During times of war the military promotes an ethical pardon on the killing of an enemy, going against the typical moral code for many service members.&lt;ref name="ncbi" /&gt; While a service member is deployed, killing of the enemy is expected and often rewarded. Despite this, when a service member returns home the sociocultural expectations are largely different from when they were deployed.&lt;ref name="ncbi" /&gt; The ethical code back home has not changed, making the transition from deployment to home difficult for some service members.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This clash in a personal ethical code and the ethical code and expectations of the military can further increase a service member’s deep-seated feelings of shame and guilt for their actions abroad.

Brett Litz and colleagues can be credited for major developments in the psychological perspective on moral injury. They define moral injury as “perpetrating, failing to prevent, bearing witness to, or learning about acts that transgress deeply held moral beliefs and expectations.”&lt;ref name="ncbi" /&gt; Litz and colleagues focus on the cognitive, behavioral, and emotional aspects of moral injury in a preliminary conceptual model. This model posits that [[cognitive dissonance]] occurs after a perceived moral transgression resulting in stable internal global attributions of blame, followed by the experience of shame, guilt, or anxiety, causing the individual to withdraw from others.&lt;ref name="ncbi" /&gt; The result is increased risk of suicide due to demoralization, self-harming, and self-handicapping behaviors.&lt;ref name="ncbi" /&gt;

Psychological risk factors that make an individual more prone to moral injury includes [[neuroticism]] and shame-proneness. Protective factors includes [[self-esteem]], forgiving supports, and belief in the [[just-world hypothesis]].&lt;ref name="ncbi" /&gt;

==Social and cultural perspective==
The concept of moral injury was introduced by clinical psychiatrist [[Jonathan Shay]], and the cultural perspective on moral injury has been developed in his work. He defines moral injury as stemming from the “betrayal of ‘what’s right’ in a high-stakes situation by someone who holds power.”&lt;ref name="JonathanShay"&gt;Jonathan Shay, Odysseus in America: Combat Trauma and the Trials of Homecoming (Scribner, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; The process of recovery, according to Shay, should consist of “purification” through the "communalization of trauma." Shay places special importance on communication through artistic means of expression. Moral injury can only be absolved when “the trauma survivor… [is] permitted and empowered to voice his or her experience….”&lt;ref name="JonathanShay" /&gt;  For this to occur, there needs to be openness on the part of civilians to hear the veterans’ experiences without prejudice. The culture in the military emphasizes a moral and ethical code that normalizes both killing and violence in times of war.&lt;ref name="ncbi" /&gt; Despite this, decisions made by service members who engage in killing or violence through this cultural lens may still experience psychological and spiritual impact.&lt;ref name="ncbi" /&gt; Fully coming “home” means integration into a culture where one is accepted, valued and respected, has a sense of place, purpose, and social support.&lt;ref name="JonathanShay" /&gt;

==Spiritual perspective==
Major developments in the spiritual perspective on moral injury can be credited to Rita Nakashima Brock and [[Gabriella Lettini]]. They emphasize moral injury as “…souls in anguish, not a psychological disorder.”&lt;ref name="RitaNakashima" /&gt; This occurs when veterans struggle with a lost sense of humanity after transgressing deeply held moral beliefs.&lt;ref name="RitaNakashima" /&gt; The Soul Repair Center at [[Brite Divinity School]] is dedicated to addressing moral injury from this spiritual perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brite.edu/soulrepair/ |title=Soul Repair : Brite Divinity School |publisher=Brite.edu |date=2014-06-20 |accessdate=2015-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research by Dr. Lindsay Carey at La Trobe University (Melbourne, Australia) and Tim Hodgson at the University of Queensland (Brisbane, Australia) confirm the importance of spirituality, and that community clergy, or chaplains in particular, have a key role with regard to providing spiritual care for those suffering a moral injury.&lt;ref&gt;Carey, Lindsay &amp; Hodgson, Timothy et al (2016) 'Moral Injury, Spiritual Care and the Role of Chaplains'. https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10943-016-0231-x&lt;/ref&gt; US Army chaplains, particularly at the US Army Medical Department Center &amp; School, are addressing the spiritual aspects of moral injury and the chaplains' role in assisting the healing process, by teaching and engaging in further research about moral injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cs.amedd.army.mil/?id=dca06bf7-3a2f-4845-b6da-f1f99412f0c8|title=U.S. Army Medical Department Center &amp; School Portal|website=www.cs.amedd.army.mil|access-date=2016-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by Carey and Hodgson &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Hodgson, T.

(2003). Odysseus in America: Combat trauma and the trials of homecoming. New York: Simon and Schuster.|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; causing confusion and making both research and treatment interventions by chaplains a serious challenge. While some have argued that moral injury is predominantly a 'psychological issue' or purely a 'spiritual' or 'religious' issue, Carey and Hodgson argue for a 'bio-psycho-social-spiritual' paradigm to be utilsed when defining, screening, assessing, or treating moral injury, so as to ensure that biological, psychological, social and spiritual aspects are equally considered in correlation; that is, moral injury should be considered as a bio-psycho-social-spiritual syndrome.

'''''Moral injury''' is a trauma related syndrome caused by the lasting physical, psychological, social and spiritual impact of grievous moral transgressions or violations of an individual’s deeply held moral beliefs and/or ethical standards due to (i) the betrayal of what is right by trusted individuals who hold legitimate authority and/or (ii) by an individual perpetrating, failing to prevent, bearing witness to, or learning about inhumane acts which result in the pain, suffering or death of others and which fundamentally challenges the moral integrity of an individual, organisation or community.''

''The violation of deeply-held moral beliefs and ethical standards—irrespective of the actual context of trauma—can lead to considerable moral dissonance, which if unresolved, leads to the development of core and secondary symptoms that often occur concurrently.  The core symptoms commonly identifiable are: (a) shame, (b) guilt, (c) a loss of trust in self, others, and/or transcendental/ultimate beings, and (d) spiritual/existential conflict including an ontological loss of meaning in life.  These core symptomatic features, influence the development of secondary indicators such as (a) depression, (b) anxiety, (c) anger, (d) re-experiencing the moral conflict, (e) social problems (e.g., social alienation) and (f) relationship issues (e.g., collegial, spousal, family), and ultimately (g) self-harm (i.e., self-sabotage, substance abuse, suicidal ideation and death).'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Carey, L.B., Swinton, J., Grossoehme, D.

The WHO-SPICs provide a framework for not only ensuring and evaluating the breadth and provision of quality spiritual care, but in addition (given contemporary moral injury is a relativey recent phenomena), the WHO-SPICs also provide a framework for considering the appropriate resourcing and implemention of such interventions for the benefit of those suffering the effects of a moral injury.

== Treating moral injury ==
There is little that is known about the treatment of moral injury. Gaudet and colleagues (2015) suggest that current interventions are lacking and new treatment interventions specific to moral injury are necessary. It is not enough to treat moral injury in the same way that depression or PTSD are commonly treated.&lt;ref name="ncbi" /&gt; In spite of the lack of research on the treatment of moral injury, factors such as humility, gratitude, respect and compassion have shown to either be protective or provide for hope for service members.

Although there is a delineation between PTSD and moral injury, the shame that many individuals face as a result of moral injury may predict symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; When considering the impact of shame in PTSD, shame is known to be highly correlated with each cluster of symptoms of PTSD.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Although no definitive treatment for moral injury has been found, it is hypothesized that treating the underlying shame that is often associated with service member’s symptoms of PTSD is necessary.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Additionally, it has been shown that allowing feelings of shame to go untreated can have deleterious effects.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This can often make the identification of moral injury in a service member difficult because shame tends to increase slowly over time.&lt;ref name="ncbi" /&gt; Shame has been linked to complications such as interpersonal violence, depression, and suicide.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Although there are no systematic reviews or meta-analyses on the treatment of moral injury, Litz and colleagues (2009) have hypothesized a modified version of CBT that addresses three key areas of moral injury: “life-threat trauma, traumatic loss, and moral injury Marines from the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.” Although a significant amount of research on moral injury and specifically the treatment of it is still lacking, these proposed treatments and protective factors provide researchers with a starting foundation.

== Moral injury of physicians ==
Moral injury in the context of healthcare was directly named in the ''Stat News'' article by Drs. Wendy Dean and Simon Talbot, entitled "Physicians aren’t ‘burning out.’ They’re suffering from moral injury."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The article and concept goes on to explain that physicians (in the United States) are caught in double and triple and quadruple binds between their obligations of electronic health records, their own student loans, the requirements for patient load through the hospital and number of procedures performed – all while working towards the goal of trying to provide the best care and healing to patients possible. However, the systemic issues facing physicians often cause deep distress because the patients are suffering, despite a physician's best efforts. This concept of moral injury in healthcare&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.moralinjury.healthcare/|title=Moral Injury of Healthcare|last=Talbot, Dean|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the expansion of the discussion around compassion fatigue and 'burnout.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Compassion fatigue|date=2018-07-18|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Compassion_fatigue&amp;oldid=850905056|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is estimated that millions of child deaths could be prevented every year if the non-specific effects of vaccines were taken into consideration in immunization programs.&lt;ref name=(2)/&gt;]]

'''Non-specific effects of vaccines''' (also called "'''heterologous effects'''" or "'''off-target effects'''") are effects which go beyond the specific protective effects against the targeted diseases. Non-specific effects can be strongly beneficial, increasing protection against non-targeted infections, but also at times negative, increasing susceptibility to non-targeted infections. This depends on both the [[vaccine]] and the sex of the infant.&lt;ref name=Benn13&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Benn|first1=CS|last2=Netea|first2=MG|last3=Selin|first3=LK|last4=Aaby|first4=P|title=A small jab - a big effect: nonspecific immunomodulation by vaccines.|journal=Trends in Immunology|date=13 May 2013 |volume=34|issue=9|pages=431–9|pmid=23680130| name-list-format=vanc|doi=10.1016/j.it.2013.04.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All [[live attenuated vaccines]] studied so far ([[BCG vaccine]], [[measles vaccine]], [[oral polio vaccine]], [[smallpox vaccine]]) have been shown to reduce [[Death|mortality]] more than can be explained by prevention of the targeted infections. In contrast, [[inactivated vaccine]]s ([[DTP vaccine|diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine]] (DTP), [[hepatitis B vaccine]], [[inactivated polio vaccine]]) may increase overall mortality despite providing protection against the target diseases.

These effects may be long-lasting, at least up to the time point where a new type of vaccine is given. The non-specific effects can be very pronounced, with significant effects on overall mortality and [[morbidity]]. In a situation with [[herd immunity]] to the target disease, the non-specific effects can be more important for overall health than the specific vaccine effects.&lt;ref name="Benn13" /&gt;

The non-specific effects should not be confused with the [[side effects]] of vaccines (such as local reactions at the side of vaccination or general reactions such as fever, head ache or rash, which usually resolve within days to weeks – or in rare cases [[anaphylaxis]]). Rather, non-specific effects represent a form of general immunomodulation, with important consequences for the [[immune system|immune system's]] ability to handle subsequent challenges.

It is estimated that millions of child deaths in [[developing country|low income countries]] could be prevented every year if the non-specific effects of vaccines were taken into consideration in immunization programs.&lt;ref name=(2)&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shann|first1=F|title=Nonspecific effects of vaccines and the reduction of mortality in children.|journal=Clinical Therapeutics|date=February 2013 |volume=35|issue=2|pages=109–14|pmid=23375475| name-list-format=vanc|doi=10.1016/j.clinthera.2013.01.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Bandim Health Project.JPG|thumb|The [[Bandim Health Project]] Office built in 2008.]]
The hypothesis that vaccines have non-specific effects was formulated in the early 1990s by [[Peter Aaby]] at the [[Bandim Health Project]] in West Africa.&lt;ref name=(3)&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Aaby |first1=P |last2=Andersen |first2=M |last3=Sodemann |first3=M |last4=Jakobsen |first4=M |last5=Gomes |first5=J |last6=Fernandes |first6=M |title=Reduced childhood mortality after standard measles vaccination at 4-8 months compared with 9-11 months of age. |journal=BMJ |date=20 November 1993 |volume=307 |issue=6915 |pages=1308–11 |pmid=8257884 |doi=10.1136/bmj.307.6915.1308 |pmc=1679462}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first indication of the importance of the non-specific effects of vaccines came in a series of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in the late 1980s. It was tested whether a high-titer (high-dose) measles vaccine (HTMV) given at 4–6 months of age was as effective against measles infection as the standard measles vaccine (MV) given at 9 months of age. Early administration of the HTMV prevented measles infection just as effectively as did the standard MV given at 9 months of age.

However, early administration of the HTMV was associated with twofold ''higher'' overall mortality among females (there was no difference in mortality for males).&lt;ref name=(6)&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Holt |first1=EA |last2=Moulton |first2=LH |last3=Siberry |first3=GK |last4=Halsey |first4=NA |title=Differential mortality by measles vaccine titer and sex. |journal=The Journal of Infectious Diseases |date=November 1993 |volume=168 |issue=5 |pages=1087–96 |pmid=8228340 |doi=10.1093/infdis/168.5.1087}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=(5)&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Aaby |first1=P |last2=Samb |first2=B |last3=Simondon |first3=F |last4=Knudsen |first4=K |last5=Seck |first5=AM |last6=Bennett |first6=J |title=Sex-specific differences in mortality after high-titre measles immunization in rural Senegal. |journal=Bull World Health Organ |date=1994 |volume=72 |issue=5 |pages=761–70 |pmid=7955026 |pmc=2486568}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=(4)&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Aaby |first1=P |last2=Knudsen |first2=K |last3=Whittle |first3=H |last4=Lisse |first4=IM |last5=Thaarup |first5=J |last6=Poulsen |first6=A |title=Long-term survival after Edmonston-Zagreb measles vaccination in Guinea-Bissau: increased female mortality rate |journal=Journal of Pediatrics |date=June 1993 |volume=122 |issue=6 |pages=904–8 |pmid=8501567 |doi=10.1016/s0022-3476(09)90015-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the girls given HTMV died more often despite having the same protection against measles as the infants given standard MV. The discovery forced [[WHO]] to withdraw the HTMV in 1992.&lt;ref name=(7)&gt;{{cite journal |title=Expanded programme on immunization (EPI). Safety of high titre measles vaccines. |journal=Wkly Epidemiol Rec |date=1992 |volume=67 |pages=357–61 |pmid=1449986}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later discovered that it was not the HTMV, but rather a subsequent inactivated vaccine (DTP or IPV for different children), that caused the increase in female mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Aaby |first1=Peter |last2=Jensen |first2=Henrik |last3=Samb |first3=Badara |last4=Cisse |first4=Badara |last5=Sodemann |first5=Morten |last6=Jakobsen |first6=Marianne |last7=Poulsen |first7=Anja |last8=Rodrigues |first8=Amabelia |last9=Lisse |first9=Ida Marie |last10=Simondon |first10=Francois |last11=Whittle |first11=Hilton |title=Differences in female-male mortality after high-titre measles vaccine and association with subsequent vaccination with diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis and inactivated poliovirus: reanalysis of West African studies |journal=The Lancet |date=28 June 2003 |volume=361 |issue=9376 |pages=2183–2188 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(03)13771-3 |url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(03)13771-3/references |pmid=12842371}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the mechanism was different than initially thought, this finding represents unexpected effects of a change in the vaccine program not attributable to the disease-specific protection provided by the vaccines.

This first observation that vaccines could protect against the target disease but at the same time affect mortality after infection with other pathogens, in a sex-differential manner, led to several further studies showing that other vaccines might also have such nonspecific effects.

==Live attenuated versus inactivated vaccines==
Numerous [[observational study|observational studies]] and [[randomized trial|randomised trials]] (RCTs) have found that the impact on mortality of live and inactivated vaccines differ markedly. All live vaccines studied so far (BCG, measles vaccine, oral polio vaccine (OPV) and smallpox vaccine) have been shown to reduce mortality more than can be explained by prevention of the targeted infection(s). In contrast, inactivated vaccines (diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP), hepatitis B, inactivated polio vaccine) may have deleterious effects in spite of providing target disease protection.&lt;ref name=(14)/&gt;

===BCG vaccine===
The live attenuated BCG vaccine developed against tuberculosis has been shown to have strong beneficial effects on the ability to combat non-tuberculosis infections.&lt;ref name=Benn13/&gt;&lt;ref name=Aaby14Oct&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aaby|first1=P|last2=Kollmann|first2=TR|last3=Benn|first3=CS|title=Nonspecific effects of neonatal and infant vaccination: public-health, immunological and conceptual challenges.|journal=Nature Immunology|date=October 2014|volume=15|issue=10|pages=895–9|pmid=25232810|doi=10.1038/ni.2961}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several studies have suggested that BCG vaccination may reduce atopy, particularly when given early in life. Furthermore, in multiple observational studies BCG vaccination has been shown to provide beneficial effects on overall mortality.&lt;ref name=Steenhuis08&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Steenhuis|first1=TJ|last2=van Aalderen|first2=WM|last3=Bloksma|first3=N|title=Bacille-Calmette-Guerin vaccination and the development of allergic disease in children: a randomized, prospective, single-blind study.|journal=Clin Exp Allergy|date=2008|volume=38|issue=1|pages=79–85|pmid=17956585|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2222.2007.02859.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; These observations encouraged randomised controlled trials to examine BCG vaccination's beneficial non-specific effects on overall health.&lt;ref name=Roth07Jan&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roth|first1=AE|last2=Nielsen|first2=J|title=A non-beneficial effect of BCG on non-tuberculous childhood mortality?|journal=Vaccine|date=2 January 2007|volume=25|issue=1|pages=12–3|pmid=16198453|doi=10.1016/j.vaccine.2005.09.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Roth04Jun&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roth|first1=A|last2=Jensen|first2=H|last3=Garly|first3=ML|last4=Djana|first4=Q|last5=Martins|first5=CL|last6=Sodemann|first6=M|last7=Rodrigues|first7=A|last8=Aaby|first8=P|title=Low birth weight infants and Calmette-Guérin bacillus vaccination at birth: community study from Guinea-Bissau.|journal=The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal|date=June 2004|volume=23|issue=6|pages=544–50|pmid=15194836|doi=10.1097/01.inf.0000129693.81082.a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Roth05Jun&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roth|first1=A|last2=Gustafson|first2=P|last3=Nhaga|first3=A|last4=Djana|first4=Q|last5=Poulsen|first5=A|last6=Garly|first6=ML|last7=Jensen|first7=H|last8=Sodemann|first8=M|last9=Rodriques|first9=A|last10=Aaby|first10=P|title=BCG vaccination scar associated with better childhood survival in Guinea-Bissau.|journal=International Journal of Epidemiology|date=June 2005|volume=34|issue=3|pages=540–7|pmid=15659474|doi=10.1093/ije/dyh392}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Roth06&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roth|first1=A|last2=Garly|first2=ML|last3=Jensen|first3=H|last4=Nielsen|first4=J|last5=Aaby|first5=P|title=Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccination and infant mortality.|journal=Expert Rev Vaccines|date=2006|volume=5|issue=2|pages=277–93|pmid=16608427|doi=10.1586/14760584.5.2.277}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since BCG vaccination is recommended to be given at birth in countries that have a high incidence of tuberculosis it would have been unethical to randomize children into 'BCG' vs. 'no BCG' groups. However, many low-income countries delay BCG vaccination for low-birth-weight (LBW) infants; this offered the opportunity to directly test the effect of BCG on overall mortality.

In the first two randomised controlled trials receipt of BCG+OPV at birth vs. OPV only ('delayed BCG') was associated with strong reductions in [[neonatal]] mortality; these effects were seen as early as 3 days after vaccination. BCG protected against [[sepsis]] as well as [[respiratory infections]].&lt;ref name=(10)&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Biering-Sorensen|first1=S|last2=Aaby|first2=P|last3=Napirna|first3=BM|last4=Roth|first4=A|last5=Ravn|first5=H|last6=Rodrigues|first6=A|title=Small randomized trial among low-birth-weight children receiving bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccination at first health center contact.|journal=Pediatr Infect Dis J|date=Mar 2012|volume=31|issue=3|pages=306–8|pmid=22189537|doi=10.1097/inf.0b013e3182458289}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=(9)&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aaby|first1=P|last2=Roth|first2=A|last3=Ravn|first3=H|last4=Napirna|first4=BM|last5=Rodrigues|first5=A|last6=Lisse|first6=IM|title=Randomized trial of BCG vaccination at birth to low-birth-weight children: beneficial nonspecific effects in the neonatal period?|journal=J Infect Dis|date=15 July 2011|volume=204|issue=2|pages=245–52|pmid=21673035|doi=10.1093/infdis/jir240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a recent WHO-commissioned review based on five clinical trials and nine observational studies, it was concluded that "the results indicated a beneficial effect of BCG on overall mortality in the first 6–12 months of life.&lt;ref name=(10)/&gt; Relevant follow-up in some of the trials was short, and all of the observational studies were regarded as being at risk of bias, so the confidence in the findings was rated as very low according to the [http://www.gradeworkinggroup.org/ GRADE criteria] and "There was a suggestion that BCG vaccination may be more beneficial the earlier it is given". Furthermore, "estimated effects are in the region of a halving of mortality risk" and "any effect of BCG vaccine on all-cause mortality is not likely to be attributable to any great extent to fewer deaths from tuberculosis (i.e. to a specific effect of BCG vaccine against tuberculosis)".&lt;ref name=(11)&gt;{{cite web|last1=WHO/SAGE|url=http://www.who.int/immunization/sage/meetings/2014/april/3_NSE_Epidemiology_review_Report_to_SAGE_14_Mar_FINAL.pdf|title=Epidemiology review Report to SAGE|accessdate=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the evidence, the WHO's Strategic Group of Experts on Immunization concluded that "the non-specific effects on all-cause mortality warrant further research".&lt;ref name=(12)&gt;{{cite journal|last1=WHO|title=Meeting of the Strategic advisory group of experts on immunization, april 2014 – conclusions and recommendations.|journal=Wkly Epidemiol Rec|pmid=24864348|date=2014|volume=89|pages=221–36|url=http://www.who.int/wer/2014/wer8921/en/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Measles vaccine===

Standard titer measles vaccine is recommended at 9 months of age in low-income countries where measles infection is endemic and often fatal. Many observational studies have shown that measles-vaccinated children have substantially lower mortality than can be explained by the prevention of measles-related deaths.&lt;ref name=(13)&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aaby|first1=P|last2=Martins|first2=CL|last3=Garly|first3=ML|last4=Rodrigues|first4=A|last5=Benn|first5=CS|last6=Whittle|first6=H|title=The optimal age of measles immunisation in low-income countries: a secondary analysis of the assumptions underlying the current policy|journal=BMJ Open|date=2012|volume=2|issue=4|pmid=22815465|doi=10.1136/bmjopen-2011-000761|pages=e000761|pmc=3401826}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these observational studies were [[natural experiments]], such as studies comparing the mortality before and after the introduction of measles vaccine and other studies where logistical factors rather than maternal choice determined whether a child was vaccinated or not.

These findings were later supported in randomized trials from 2003 to 2009 in Guinea-Bissau. An intervention group of children given standard titer measles vaccine at 4.5 and 9 month of age had a 30% reduction in all-cause mortality compared to the children in the control group, which were only vaccinated against measles at 9 month of age.&lt;ref name=(14)&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aaby|first1=P|last2=Martins|first2=CL|last3=Garly|first3=ML|last4=Bale|first4=C|last5=Andersen|first5=A|last6=Rodrigues|first6=A|title=Non-specific effects of standard measles vaccine at 4.5 and 9 months of age on childhood mortality: randomised controlled trial.|journal=BMJ|date=2010|volume=341|issue=6495|pmid=21118875|pages=c6495|doi=10.1136/bmj.c6495|pmc=2994348}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a recent WHO-commissioned review based on four randomized trials and 18 observational studies, it was concluded that "There was consistent evidence of a beneficial effect of measles vaccine, although all observational studies were assessed as being at risk of bias and the [http://www.gradeworkinggroup.org GRADE rating] was of low confidence. There was an apparent difference between the effect in girls and boys, with girls benefitting more from measles vaccination", and furthermore "estimated effects are in the region of a halving of mortality risk" and "if these effects are real then they are not fully explained by deaths that were established as due to measles".&lt;ref name=(11)/&gt; Based on the evidence, the [http://www.who.int/immunization/policy/sage/en WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization] concluded that "the non-specific effects on all-cause mortality warrant further research".&lt;ref name=(12)/&gt;[http://www.who.int/wer/2014/wer8921/en/]

===Diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine===
DTP vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis does not seem to have the same beneficial effects as BCG, measles vaccine, OPV and smallpox vaccine, and in fact opposite effects are observed.&lt;ref name=(15)&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aaby|first1=P|last2=Benn|first2=C|last3=Nielsen|first3=J|last4=Lisse|first4=IM|last5=Rodrigues|first5=A|last6=Ravn|first6=H|title=Testing the hypothesis that diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine has negative non-specific and sex-differential effects on child survival in high-mortality countries|journal=BMJ Open|date=2012|volume=2|issue=3|pmid=22619263|doi=10.1136/bmjopen-2011-000707|pages=e000707|pmc=3364456}}&lt;/ref&gt; The negative effects are seen as long as DTP vaccine is the most recent vaccine. BCG or measles vaccine given after DTP reverses the negative effects of DTP.&lt;ref name=(15)/&gt; The negative effects are seen mostly in females.&lt;ref name=(15)/&gt;

The negative effects are found in several observational studies. However, six WHO-commissioned studies concluded that there were strong beneficial effects of DTP on overall mortality.&lt;ref name=(21)&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nyarko|first1=P|last2=Pence|first2=B|last3=Debpuur|first3=C|title=Immunization status and child survival in rural Ghana.|journal=Population council|date=2001|volume=Working papers no. 147}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=(20)&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lehmann|first1=D|last2=Vail|first2=J|last3=Firth|first3=MJ|last4=de Klerk|first4=NH|last5=Alpers|first5=MP|title=Benefits of routine immunizations on childhood survival in Tari, Southern Highlands Province, Papua New Guinea|journal=Int J Epidemiol|date=Feb 2005|volume=34|issue=1|pages=138–48|pmid=15561755|doi=10.1093/ije/dyh262}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=(19)&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Elguero|first1=E|last2=Simondon|first2=KB|last3=Vaugelade|first3=J|last4=Marra|first4=A|last5=Simondon|first5=F|title=Non-specific effects of vaccination on child survival?

In a recent WHO-commissioned review of DTP based on ten observational studies, it was concluded that, "the findings were inconsistent, with a majority of the studies indicating a detrimental effect of DTP, and two studies indicating a beneficial effect. All of the studies were regarded as being at risk of bias, so the confidence in the findings was rated as very low according to the GRADE criteria."

Furthermore, "three observational studies provided a suggestion that simultaneous administration of BCG and DTP may be preferable to the recommended schedule of BCG before DTP; and there was suggestion that mortality risk may be higher when DTP is  given with, or after, measles vaccine compared with when it is given before measles vaccine (from five, and three, observational studies, respectively). These results are consistent with hypotheses that DTP vaccine may have detrimental effects on mortality, although a majority of the evidence was generated by a group centred in Guinea-Bissau who have often written in defence of such a hypothesis."&lt;ref name=(11)/&gt;

===Smallpox vaccine===
When smallpox vaccine was introduced in the early 19s century, there were anecdotal descriptions of non-specific beneficial effects. In the second half of the 20th century the potential for beneficial non-specific effects of smallpox vaccine was reviewed, and new evidence on "[[para-immune effects]]" was added.&lt;ref name=(25)&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mayr|first1=A|title=Taking advantage of the positive side-effects of smallpox vaccination.|journal=J Vet Med B Infect Dis Vet Public Health.|date=June 2004|volume=51|issue=5|pages=199–201|pmid=15330977|doi=10.1111/j.1439-0450.2004.00763.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent studies have focused on the phasing out of smallpox vaccine in the 1970s and compared vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts.
 
Smallpox vaccine leaves a very characteristic scar. In low-income countries, having a smallpox vaccine scar has been associated with reductions of more than 40% in overall mortality among adults;&lt;ref name=(27)&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jensen|first1=ML|last2=Dave|first2=S|last3=Schim van der Loeff|first3=M|last4=da Costa|first4=C|last5=Vincent|first5=T|last6=Leligdowicz|first6=A|title=Vaccinia scars associated with improved survival among adults in rural Guinea-Bissau|journal=PLOS ONE|date=2006|volume=1|issue=101|pmid=17183634|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0000101|pmc=1762358|pages=e101}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=(26)&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aaby|first1=P|last2=Gustafson|first2=P|last3=Roth|first3=A|last4=Rodrigues|first4=A|last5=Fernandes|first5=M|last6=Sodemann|first6=M|title=Vaccinia scars associated with better survival for adults.

However it should be noted that no randomized trials testing the effect of smallpox vaccine on overall mortality and morbidity have been conducted.

==Sex differences==
Non-specific effects are frequently different in males and females. There are accumulating data illustrating that males and females may respond differently to vaccination, both in terms of the quality and quantity of the immune response.&lt;ref name=(6)/&gt;&lt;ref name=(5)/&gt;&lt;ref name=(4)/&gt;&lt;ref name=(15)/&gt;&lt;ref name=(31)/&gt; If true, then we must consider whether vaccination schedules should differ for males and females, or as has been suggested "should we treat the sexes differently in order to treat them equally?"&lt;ref name=(31)&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Flanagan|first1=KL|last2=Klein|first2=SL|last3=Skakkebaek|first3=NE|last4=Marriott|first4=I|last5=Marchant|first5=A|last6=Selin|first6=L|title=Sex differences in the vaccine-specific and non-targeted effects of vaccines.|journal=Vaccine|date=16 Mar 2011|volume=29|issue=13|pages=2349–54|pmid=21300095|doi=10.1016/j.vaccine.2011.01.071}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interactions between health interventions==
The non-specific effects of vaccines can be boosted or diminished when other immunomodulating health interventions such as other vaccines, or vitamins, are provided.&lt;ref name=(32)&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Benn|first1=CS|last2=Bale|first2=C|last3=Sommerfelt|first3=H|last4=Friis|first4=H|last5=Aaby|first5=P|title=Hypothesis: Vitamin A supplementation and childhood mortality: amplification of the non-specific effects of vaccines?|journal=Int J Epidemiol|date=2003|volume=32|issue=5|pages=822–8|pmid=14559758|doi=10.1093/ije/dyg208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence of pre-existing specific immunity==
The beneficial NSEs of live vaccines are stronger with earlier vaccination, possibly due to maternal antibodies.&lt;ref name=(33)&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aaby|first1=P|last2=Martins|first2=CL|last3=Garly|first3=ML|last4=Andersen|first4=A|last5=Fisker|first5=AB|last6=Claesson|first6=MH|title=Measles vaccination in the presence or absence of maternal measles antibody: Impact on child survival.|journal=Clin Infect Dis|date=14 May 2014|pmid=24829213|doi=10.1093/cid/ciu354|volume=59|pages=484–92|pmc=4111916}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boosting with live vaccines also seems to enhance the beneficial effects.

==High-income countries==
The non-specific effects were primarily observed in low-income countries with high infectious disease burdens, but they may not be limited to these areas. Recent [[Denmark|Danish]] register-based studies have shown that the live attenuated [[MMR vaccine|measles-mumps-rubella vaccine]] (MMR) protects against hospital admissions with infectious diseases and specifically getting ill by respiratory syncytial virus.&lt;ref name=(35)&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sorup|first1=S|last2=Benn|first2=CS|last3=Stensballe|first3=LG|last4=Aaby|first4=P|last5=Ravn|first5=H|title=Measles-mumps-rubella vaccination and respiratory syncytial virus-associated hospital contact|journal=Vaccine|date=1 Jan 2015|volume=33|pmid=25446818|doi=10.1016/j.vaccine.2014.07.110|pages=237–45|pmc=4270443}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=(34)&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sorup|first1=S|last2=Benn|first2=CS|last3=Poulsen|first3=A|last4=Krause|first4=TG|last5=Aaby|first5=P|last6=Ravn|first6=H|title=Live vaccine against measles, mumps, and rubella and the risk of hospital admissions for nontargeted infections.|journal=JAMA|date=26 Feb 2014|volume=311|issue=8|pages=826–35|pmid=24570246|doi=10.1001/jama.2014.470}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Castro15&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Castro|first1=MJ|last2=Pardo-Seco|first2=J|last3=Martinón-Torres|first3=F|title=Nonspecific (Heterologous) Protection of Neonatal BCG Vaccination Against Hospitalization Due to Respiratory Infection and Sepsis.|journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases|date=27 February 2015|pmid=25725054|doi=10.1093/cid/civ144|volume=60|pages=1611–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Immunological mechanisms==
The findings from the epidemiological studies on the non-specific effects of vaccines pose a challenge to the current understanding of vaccines, and how they affect the immune system, and also question whether boys and girls have identical immune systems and should receive the same treatment.

The mechanisms for these effects are unclear. It is not known how vaccination induces rapid beneficial or harmful changes in the general susceptibility to infectious diseases, but the following mechanisms are likely to be involved.

===Heterologous T-cell immunity===
It is well known from animal studies that infections, apart from inducing pathogen-specific [[T-cells]], also induce cross-reactive T-cells through epitope sharing, so-called heterologous immunity.&lt;ref name=(37)&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Welsh|first1=RM|last2=Che|first2=JW|last3=Brehm|first3=MA|last4=Selin|first4=LK|title=Heterologous immunity between viruses|journal=Immunological reviews|date=May 2010|volume=235|issue=1|pages=244–66|pmid=20536568|doi=10.1111/j.0105-2896.2010.00897.x|pmc=2917921}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=(36)&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Welsh|first1=RM|last2=Selin|first2=LK|title=No one is naive: the significance of heterologous T-cell immunity.|journal=Nat Rev Immunol|date=June 2002|volume=2|issue=6|pages=417–26|pmid=12093008|doi=10.1038/nri820}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heterologous T-cell immunity can lead to improved clearance of a subsequent cross-reactive challenge, but it may also lead to increased morbidity.&lt;ref name=(38)&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Selin|first1=LK|last2=Wlodarczyk|first2=MF|last3=Kraft|first3=AR|last4=Nie|first4=S|last5=Kenney|first5=LL|last6=Puzone|first6=R|title=Heterologous immunity: immunopathology, autoimmunity and protection during viral infections.|journal=Autoimmunity|date=June 2011|volume=44|issue=4|pages=328–47|pmid=21250837|doi=10.3109/08916934.2011.523277|pmc=3633594}}&lt;/ref&gt; This mechanism may explain why DTP could have negative effects.

It would, however, not explain effects occurring shortly after vaccination, as for instance the rapidly occurring beneficial effects of BCG vaccine,&lt;ref name=(10)/&gt; as the heterologous effect would only be expected to be present after some weeks, as the adaptive immune response need time to develop. Also, it is difficult to explain why the effect would vanish once a child receives a new vaccine.

===Trained innate immunity===
The concept that not only plants and insects, but also humans have innate immune memory may provide new clues to why vaccines have non-specific effects. Studies into BCG have recently revealed that BCG induces epigenetic changes in the monocytes in adults, leading to increased pro-inflammatory cytokine production upon challenges with unrelated [[mitogens]] and [[pathogens]] (trained innate immunity).&lt;ref name=(39)&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kleinnijenhuis|first1=J|last2=Quintin|first2=J|last3=Preijers|first3=F|last4=Joosten|first4=LAB|last5=Ifrim|first5=DC|last6=Saeed|first6=S|title=Bacille Calmette-Guerin induces NOD2-dependent nonspecific protection from reinfection via epigenetic reprogramming of monocytes|journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A|date=23 Oct 2012|volume=109|issue=43|pages=17537–42|pmid=22988082|doi=10.1073/pnas.1202870109|pmc=3491454}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[SCID mice]] that have no adaptive immune system, BCG reduced mortality from an otherwise lethal [[candida infection]]. The effects of BCG presented when tested after 2 weeks, but would be expected to occur rapidly after vaccination, and hence might be able to explain the very rapid protection against neonatal [[septicaemia]] seen after BCG vaccine.&lt;ref name=(40)&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aaby|first1=P|last2=Benn|first2=CS|title=Saving lives by training innate immunity with bacille Calmette-Guerin vaccine|journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A|date=23 Oct 2012|volume=109|issue=43|pages=17317–8|pmid=23071307|doi=10.1073/pnas.1215761109|pmc=3491466}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trained [[innate immunity]] may also explain the generally increased resistance against broad disease categories, such as [[fevers]] and lower [[respiratory tract infections]]; such effects would be difficult to explain merely by shared [[epitope]]s, unless such epitopes were almost universally common on pathogens.

Lastly, it is plausible that the effects are reversible by a different vaccine. Hence, trained innate immunity may provide a biological mechanism for the observed non-specific effects of vaccines.&lt;ref name=(39)/&gt;

==Controversy==
In 2000 Aaby and colleagues presented data from Guinea-Bissau which suggested that DTP vaccination could, under some circumstances (e.g. absence of [[pertussis]]) be associated with increases in overall mortality, at least until children received measles vaccine. In response, WHO sponsored the analysis of a variety of data sets in other populations to test the hypothesis. None of these studies replicated the observation of increased mortality associated with DTP vaccination.&lt;ref name=(21)/&gt;&lt;ref name=(20)/&gt;&lt;ref name=(19)/&gt;&lt;ref name=(18)/&gt;&lt;ref name=(17)/&gt;&lt;ref name=(16)/&gt; WHO subsequently concluded, that the evidence was sufficient to reject the hypothesis for an increased nonspecific mortality following DTP vaccination.&lt;ref name=(41)&gt;{{cite journal|last1=WHO|title=Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety, 20–21 June|journal=Weekly epidemiological record|date=22 November 2002|volume=77|issue=47|pages=389–404|url=http://www.who.int/docstore/wer/pdf/2002/wer7747.pdf|accessdate=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Aaby and colleagues subsequently pointed out that the studies which failed to show any mortality increase associated with DTP vaccination used methods of analysis that can introduce a bias against finding such an effect.&lt;ref name=(24)/&gt;

In these studies, data on childhood vaccinations were typically collected in periodic surveys, and the information on vaccinations, which occurred between successive home visits, was updated at the time of the second visit. The person-time at risk in unvaccinated and vaccinated states was then divided up according to the date of vaccination during the time interval between visits. This method opens up a potential bias, insofar as the updating of person time at risk from unvaccinated to vaccinated is only possible for children who survive to the second follow-up. Those who die between visits typically do not have vaccinations between the first visit and death recorded, and thus they will tend to be allocated as deaths in unvaccinated children – thus incorrectly inflating the mortality rate among unvaccinated children.&lt;ref name=(24)/&gt;

This bias has been described before, but in different contexts, as the distinction between 'landmark' and 'retrospective updating' analysis of [[cohort (statistics)|cohort]] data.&lt;ref name=(43)/&gt; The retrospective updating method can lead to a considerable bias in vaccine studies, biasing observed mortality rate ratios towards zero (a large effect), whereas the landmark method leads to a non-specific misclassification and biases the mortality rate ratio towards unity(no effect).

An additional problem with the literature on the nonspecific effects of vaccines has been the variety and unexpected nature of the hypotheses which have appeared (in particular relating to sex-specific effects), which has meant that it has not always been clear whether some apparent 'effects' were the result of [[post hoc analysis|post hoc analyses]] or whether they were reflections of [[A priori probability|a priori]] hypotheses.

This was discussed at length at a review of the work of Aaby and his colleagues in Copenhagen in 2005.&lt;ref name=(22)/&gt; The review was convened by the Danish National Research Foundation and the [[Novo Nordisk Foundation]] who have sponsored much of the work of Aaby and his colleagues. An outcome of the review was the explicit formulation of a series of testable hypotheses, agreed by the Aaby group.&lt;ref name=(22)/&gt; It was hoped that independent investigators would design and conduct studies powered to confirm or refute these hypotheses.

Also, the two foundations sponsored a workshop on the analysis of vaccine effects, which was held in London in 2008.&lt;ref name=(22)/&gt; The workshop resulted in three papers.&lt;ref name=(43)&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farrington|first1=CP|last2=Firth|first2=MJ|last3=Moulton|first3=LH|last4=Ravn|first4=H|last5=Andersen|first5=PK|last6=Evans|first6=S|title=Epidemiological studies of the non-specific effects of vaccines: II - methodological issues in the design and analysis of cohort studies.|journal=Trop Med Int Health|date=2009|volume=14|issue=9|pages=977–85|pmid=19531116|doi=10.1111/j.1365-3156.2009.02302.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=(44)&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shann|first1=F|last2=Nohynek|first2=H|last3=Scott|first3=JA|last4=Hesseling|first4=A|last5=Flanagan|first5=KL|title=Randomized Trials to Study the Nonspecific Effects of Vaccines in Children in Low-Income Countries|journal=Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal|date=2010|volume=29|issue=5|pages=457–61|pmid=20431383|doi=10.1097/inf.0b013e3181c91361}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=(42)&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fine|first1=PEM|last2=Williams|first2=TN|last3=Aaby|first3=P|last4=Källander|first4=K|last5=Moulton|first5=LH|last6=Flanagan|first6=KL|title=Epidemiological studies of the 'non-specific effects' of vaccines: I - data collection in observational studies|journal=Trop Med Int Health|date=2009|volume=14|issue=9|pages=969–76|pmid=19531117|doi=10.1111/j.1365-3156.2009.02301.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proceedings were forwarded to WHO which subsequently concluded that it would "keep a watch on the evidence of nonspecific effects of vaccination".&lt;ref name=(45)&gt;{{cite journal|last1=WHO|title=Meeting of Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety|journal=Wkly Epidemiol Rec|date=18 July 2008|volume=83|issue=32|pages=285–92|url=http://www.who.int/wer/2008/wer8332/en/|pmid=18689006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, WHO established a working group tasked with reviewing the evidence for the non-specific effects of BCG, measles and DTP vaccines. Two independent reviews were conducted, an immunological review&lt;ref name=(46)&gt;{{cite web|last1=WHO|title=Systematic Review of the Non-specific Immunological Effects of Selected Routine|url=http://www.who.int/immunization/sage/meetings/2014/april/2_NSE_Immunology_review_version_for_SAGE_JLC.pdf|website=WHO|publisher=The Oxford University|accessdate=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an epidemiological review.&lt;ref name=(11)/&gt; The results were presented at the April 2014 meeting of WHO's Strategic Gourp of Experts on Immunizations (SAGE). WHO/SAGE  concluded that further research into the potential NSEs of vaccines was warranted.&lt;ref name=(12)/&gt;

==Implications for world health==
{{POV|date=August 2017}}
It would have major consequences for child survival if the non-specific effects of vaccines were taken into consideration in immunization programs: BCG and MV should be given to all children as early as possible; restrictive policies for opening multi-dose vials of BCG and MV should be abandoned.

Contrary to current WHO-recommendations, the age of MV should not be raised when measles infection is under control; DTP should not be given simultaneously with MV or after MV; and a booster dose of DTP is likely to have a negative effect on child survival. Finally, eradicating a disease and stopping a live vaccine with beneficial NSEs is likely to have negative effects for the overall health of the affected population.&lt;ref name=(2)/&gt;&lt;ref name=(27)/&gt;&lt;ref name=(26)/&gt;

Dr. Frank Shann from Australia recently assessed the consequences of changing the current [[EPI vaccine|EPI]] schedule to an alternative schedule taking non-specific effects into account, and concluded: "If all neonates in high-mortality regions were given BCG at birth, and the revised immunization schedule ... were adopted, with extra doses of measles vaccine at 14 weeks and 19 months (at a cost of only US $0.60/dose delivered), ~1 million (30%) of the 3.2 million neonatal deaths each year might be prevented in developing countries, and 1.5 million (30%) of the 4.8 million deaths between 1 month and 5 years of age might be prevented". Furthermore: "This very large reduction in mortality in children &lt;5 years of age would be achieved at a low cost using only vaccines that are already in the routine EPI schedule".&lt;ref name=(2)/&gt;

==''The Arc of the Swallow''==
In 2008, Danish crime novel author [[Sissel-Jo Gazan]] (author of the Danish crime novel ''Dinosaur Feather'') became interested in the work of the [[Bandim Health Project]] and based her science crime novel ''The Arc of the Swallow'' (''Svalens Graf'') on the research into non-specific effects of vaccines.

The novel was published in Danish in 2013; it was on the best-seller list for months and won the Readers' Prize 2014 in Denmark. It was published in English in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] on November 6, 2014 and in the US on April 7, 2015.

Occupational health concerns are becoming increasingly important as cannabis becomes legal in more areas of the US.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Of note, employers have concerns of workers either coming to work acutely impaired or recent use of cannabis still being detected in the body. Employment issues such as [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|ADA]] law as it relates to accommodations for cannabis, paying unemployment benefits or paying out workers compensation benefits and disability claims are all important issues. While federal law still prohbitis use, employers in different states have taken different stances based on whether they are federal contractors, perform safety sensitive work or whether the cannabis use is acutely impairing the employee.

[[Cannabis (drug)|Cannabis]] is currently the most commonly used illicit drug in the world and one of the earliest plants cultivated by humans. Early evidence of cannabis use in medicine has been found in China and India for religious and medicinal uses. Archaeological research shows early civilization cultivation of hemp in India to create a variety of products from ropes, textiles and paper. In countries, such as [[Nepal]] and [[China]], cannabis seeds are still used today both as a pharmaceutical as well as a food enhancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=History of cannabis as a medicine: A review|last=Zuardi|first=Antonio Waldo|publisher=|year=2006|isbn=|location=|pages=153–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As cannabis use increases and more states [[Cannabis in the United States|legalize use in the US]], there are concerns surrounding the use of cannabis and its effects on job performance and safety. There are also concerns that the concentration of [[Tetrahydrocannabinol|THC]] have increased over the past 50 years, thereby increasing the effects of the drug.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Phillips|first=Jennan|date=2015|title=Marijuana in the workplace: Guidance for occupational health professionals and employers: Joint guidance statement of the american association of occupational health nurses and the american college of occupational and environmental medicine|url=|journal=Workplace Health and Safety|volume=|pages=139|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Controlled Substances Act]] of 1970 currently lists cannabis as a Schedule 1 drug, deeming it to be a substance with high risk of dependence, abuse and no (supervised) medical uses.

The [[Cato Institute|CATO]] institute estimates that legalizing drugs would save $41 billion per year along with $46.7 billion in revenue, if taxed at the same rates as alcohol and tobacco.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=The budgetary impact of ending drug prohibition, Miron and Waldock, Cato Institute 2010 https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/DrugProhibitionWP.pdf|title=The budgetary impact of ending drug prohibition|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Employers and employees have faced new challenges in the workplace with the increasing legislation of cannabis. State law can have provisions, for an employer to refuse to hire based on marijuana use, under the concern of safety, productivity and company reputation. Companies that have “[[Hazardous work|safety sensitive work]]” or include operating machinery or large vehicles are also free to institute a zero-tolerance policy for its employees. For the approximate 10 million [[Commercial driver's license training|CDL]] (Commercial Drivers Licenses) drivers in the USA, federal law requires they pass employer drug tests under the Omnibus Transportation Employee Safety Act of 1991.

Individual states in response to the federal government differed in how they dealt with cannabis. California was the first state to pass medical marijuana in 1996, followed by 23 other states currently permitting the use of medical marijuana.

== Cannabis issues related to public and private employers ==

In the case of U.S. v. Stacey among several others, the legality of cannabis use has been contested since citizens who argue for protection under state law, are always subject to federal charges&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=Houser, Kimberly A., and Robert E.

International Journal of Business and Public Administration (IJBPA) 11 (2): 131.|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there has been some guidance from the Department of Justice to the DEA to reassess its priorities in the drug war and to target larger threats and substances, the interpretation is still subjective and has not prevented large scale raids on medical marijuana facilities across the country.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== State response to cannabis ==

California was the first state to pass medical marijuana in 1996, followed by 23 other states currently permitting the use of medical marijuana &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=Introduction - NORML. Marijuana Law Reform - NORML. N.p., n.d. Web http://norml.org/laws|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the states that have legalized medical marijuana, employees and employers have had to face new challenges in the workplace. State law can have provisions, for an employer to refuse to hire based on marijuana use, under the concern of safety, productivity and company reputation. Companies that have a lot of “safety sensitive work” or include operating machinery or large vehicles are also free to institute a zero-tolerance policy for its employees. For the approximate 10 million CDL ([[Commercial driver's license|Commercial Drivers Licenses]]) drivers in the USA, federal law requires they pass employer drug tests under the [[Omnibus Transportation Employee Safety Act]] of 1991.

Drivers that use cannabis show impairment both in simulator and on the road tests, mainly on the abilities to “..concentrate and maintain attention, estimate time and distance, and demonstrate coordination on divided attention tasks—all important requirements for operating a motor vehicle”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Department of Transportation (DOT) has also stated in its Drug and Alcohol Testing Regulations that cannabis is not acceptable for any employee engaged in safety sensitive work.Currently, there are federal laws that give employers guidance and protection on how to ensure a drug free workplace despite the increase in cannabis use. According to the [[National Association of Attorneys General]] (NAAG), in Colorado the number of positive drug tests for marijuana went up by 20% between 2012-2013, compared to the national average increase of 5%&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Francesca Liquori, "The Effects of Marijuana Legalization on Employment Law," National Attorney's General Training and Research Institute Journal 1, no. 2 (February/March, 2016): , http://www.naag.org/publications/nagtri-journal/volume-1-number-2/the-effects-of-marijuana-legalization-on-employment-law.php|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For those companies that have received federal grants and have federal contracts over $100,000, they follow [[The Drug Free Workplace Act]] of 1988, a comprehensive policy, which includes drug prevention methods, information about employee assistance programs and disciplinary consequences of drug use in the workplace &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=US Department of Labor, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Policy.

The policy requires employees to report any criminal drug violations in the workplace to the employer within 5 calendar days which may subsequently result in discipline including termination, regardless of state law &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Costello, Bob.

== Cannabis related to [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|ADA]] issues ==

The [[Occupational and Safety Act of 1970]] includes a [[general duty clause]] for employers to protect employees from exposure for those compounds with no regulated standards of safe exposure. It has been defined broadly as to “maintain conditions or adopt practices reasonably necessary and appropriate to protect workers on the job.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp?pid=3359&amp;p |at= table OSHACT |title=US Department of Labor.

Duties |last=|first=|date= |website= osha.gov |archive-url= |archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ADA prohibits employers from discriminating against disabled individuals, which is defined as “a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, a person who has a history or record of such an impairment, or a person who is perceived by others as having such an impairment.”

Employers under this law have an obligation to provide “reasonable accommodations” to the disabled employee, so they may perform the essential duties of the job, as long as those accommodations don’t pose an undue hardship on the employer".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web |title= What Is the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)?"

== Wrongful termination for cannabis ==

Coats v. Dish Network LLC, held that a “state’s lawful activities statute does not protect a worker’s off-duty use of medical marijuana because this activity is not lawful under federal law” under the ordinary meaning of “permitted by law” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Coats v.

== Workers compensation benefits ==

The [[Federal Employees' Compensation Act|Federal Employees Compensation Act]] (FECA) provides for the payment of workers’ compensation benefits, including wages and medical benefits, to civilian officers and employees of all branches of the federal government, whereas state law has oversight over its own workers’ compensation program

[[Federal Employees' Compensation Act|FECA]] prohibits employees from receiving compensation when the injury “was proximately… caused by the intoxication by… illegal drugs” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Moore v.

Agreed with the employer and held that unemployment insurance benefits could be withheld due to the violation of the employer’s zero tolerance drug policy. Worker was a sweeper using cannabis legally outside of working hours

Colorado State statue “disqualifies an individual from receiving unemployment benefits after the presence of a controlled substance was not medically prescribed was found in the worker’s system during worker hours.”

== Drug testing in the workplace ==

Cannabis has unique [[Cannabis (pharmacology)|pharmacokinetics]] and metabolism which makes it a challenge to drug test for acute impairment vs recent use. [[Tetrahydrocannabinol|THC]] is deposited in fat and can be detectable in urine for up to a month or more. However, it is not always an indicator of acute impairment. Further there are privacy concerns, from invasive blood testing for compounds, under the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|4th Amendment]] of the US constitution. Variability in study designs, ethical dilemma of safety and productivity, work type and drug metabolism in users. When smoked, blood levels of THC immediately rise and are distributed primarily in the lungs and brain. •THC is metabolized to the transient psychoactive substance THC-OH, which is finally converted to THC-COOH, the physiologically inactive metabolite

The immediate euphoria and subsequent impairment from THC-OH, as suggested by older studies may last about 6 hours, with some limited studies showing impairment lasting as long as 24 to 48 hours&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=J. A. Phillips et al., "Marijuana in the Workplace" 461|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific studies that assess driving and impairment show a return to "...nonimpaired state within 3-6 hours“&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Quickly sequestered into fat tissues therefore decreasing blood concentration

Ingesting cannabis has much longer magnified effect of the drug

The method of testing cannabis in urine can be misleading, due to the potential for interpreting a positive result for THC-COOH, as an indicator of acute impairment.

Lack of concentration, impaired learning and memory, alterations in thought formation, expression and sedation. Physiological signs include [[tachycardia]], dilated pupils with injected [[conjunctiva]], dry mouth and increased appetite Studies have also confirmed that impairment is related on a dose response relationship.

== Challenges for healthcare providers ==

A large study in France of over 10,000 crashes, concluded an odds ratio of 2.18 for THC level less than 1&amp;nbsp;ng/ml up to 4.72 for THC 5&amp;nbsp;ng/ml for being involved in a crash &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ménétrey|first=Annick|last2=Augsburger|first2=Marc|last3=Favrat|first3=Bernard|last4=Pin|first4=Marie A.|last5=Rothuizen|first5=Laura E.|last6=Appenzeller|first6=Monique|last7=Buclin|first7=Thierry|last8=Mangin|first8=Patrice|last9=Giroud|first9=Christian|date=2005-07-01|title=Assessment of Driving Capability Through the Use of Clinical and Psychomotor Tests in Relation to Blood Cannabinoids Levels Following Oral Administration of 20 mg Dronabinol or of a Cannabis Decoction Made with 20 or 60 mg Δ9-THC*|url=http://academic.oup.com/jat/article/29/5/327/730643/Assessment-of-Driving-Capability-Through-the-Use|journal=Journal of Analytical Toxicology|language=en|volume=29|issue=5|pages=327–338|doi=10.1093/jat/29.5.327|issn=0146-4760}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers such as ''Donzé N'', ''Ménétrey'' have considered categorizing impairment as the sum of THC, THC-OH and THC-COOH, which would be more accurate for assessing impairment since it would include the active metabolite; however, more research is needed along with better point of care detection

Some Norwegian studies have suggested that individuals with levels of 2-5&amp;nbsp;ng/mL experienced “moderate established impairment” and levels of THC above 5 -10&amp;nbsp;ng/ml was likely to be severe impairment.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The consensus from a meta-analysis study shows that serum levels of an average of 3.8 (ranging from 3.1 to 4.5) for oral cannabis and an average of 3.8 (ranging from 3.3 to 4.5) for smoker cannabis cause a similar impairment to a BAC of around 0.05g/dL, i.e. a 5&amp;nbsp;ng/mL cutoff would resemble the level of impairment allowed for alcohol under federal testing laws&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Concentration of drugs in blood of suspected impaired drivers Augsburger, Marc et al.

However, since the presence of metabolites does not automatically indicate impairment, an immediate physical exam by a physician is advised to correlate findings clinically to diagnose impairment &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

'''Antenatal perineal massage''' (APM) or '''birth canal widening''' (BCW) is the [[massage]] of a [[pregnant]] woman's [[perineum]] around the opening to the [[vagina]], performed anywhere in the 4 to 6 weeks before [[childbirth]] and usually on 4-6 separate occasions. The practice aims to more gently mimic the massaging action of a baby's head on the opening to the birth canal prior to birth, which enables some of the hard work of labour to be done before the start of labour. The intention is to attempt to prevent tearing of the perineum during birth, and reduce the need for an [[episiotomy]] or an instrument ([[Forceps in childbirth|forceps]] or [[Ventouse|vacuum extraction]]) delivery.

==Description==
The Oxford Radcliffe NHS Trust Document "Antenatal Perineal Massage" 2011 describes the use of the pregnant mother's thumbs being placed just inside the birth canal, whilst she stands with one foot supported on the toilet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umich.edu/~umperl/massage.htm| title=Promoting Effective Recovery from Labor}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ouh.nhs.uk/patient-guide/leaflets/files%5C090924perinealmassage.pdf|title=The Oxford Radcliffe NHS Trust Document "Antenatal Perineal Massage" information document for women}}&lt;/ref&gt; She pulls backwards towards her spine, whilst relaxing her pelvic floor, progressively increasing the pressure under her finger tips until this starts to feel uncomfortable. On the next occasion she uses both thumbs pulling backwards and then sideways, thumbs away from each other, to enlarge the 2&amp;nbsp;cm diameter opening of the birth canal progressively over time to 10&amp;nbsp;cm. It is not possible to stretch this opening further causing damage, because this will be limited by the distance between the bony walls of the pelvis.

==Purposes==
The goal of APM is to prevent the baby's head from undergoing excessive strain during the last 30 minutes of labour. It seeks to train the mother to relax her pelvic floor to allow the baby's head to pass through the opening, to stretch the two fibrous layers within the Uro-Genital Membrane, a triangular shaped muscular shelf at the front half of the opening of the bony pelvis, through which the 2&amp;nbsp;cm diameter birth canal and urethra pass, and to transform the fat packed rigid skin at the opening to the birth canal into paper thin stretchy elastic skin, all without using the baby's head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0Ax3rLFc6M|title=Pelvic Floor Part2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
If the external skin (perineal skin) opening has been stretched before birth, to 10&amp;nbsp;cm, then there is no reason to perform an episiotomy to increase the diameter of the opening of the birth canal. Tearing is less likely as the external skin at the opening has been stretched already and is lax, whilst the underlying muscular pelvic floor has not been damaged. Episiotomy permanently damages the pelvic floor muscle, as the episiotomy cuts through the nerve supply to this muscle, so the larger part of the pelvic floor muscles atrophies and becomes replaced by scar tissue, increasing the mother's chance of developing a prolapse in the future. Antenatal Perineal Massage does not damage the pelvic floor, so protects against a prolapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1016/0091-2182(86)90148-5/full|title=Effect of Perineal Massage on the incidence of episiotomy and perineal laceration 1986 | doi=10.1016/0091-2182(86)90148-5 | volume=31|journal=Journal of Nurse-Midwifery|pages=128–134|author=Avery M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Antenatal perineal massage or pre-birth obstetric massage (birth canal widening) has been used for many generations both by Chukchi Eskimos in Siberia and by African tribal people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epi-no.com.au/the-epi-no-story/|title=Epi-no story Inspired by an African experience}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using an index finger and progressing to index, middle and ring finger massage, performed by the pregnant mother's spouse, after sexual intercourse, when the mother is relaxed has also been described{{by whom|date=September 2014}} enabling the father to take an active role in aiding the birth.  Glass bottles of increasing sizes have also been used as the instrument of massage.

The German obstetrician Mr Welheim Horkel, when visiting a medical mission in the mid-1980s, learned that African tribes used gourds of increasing sizes as instruments of massage, with mothers aiding their daughters' labours in this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epi-no.com.au/the-epi-no-story/|title=Epi-no story From Starnberg to over 20 countries}}&lt;/ref&gt;

West Berkshire England performed an Antenatal Massage trial in 1984, and many small trials have been performed worldwide since. Cochrane Collaborate Reports since 2006 have advised that women should be informed that episiotomy is avoidable if they employ digital Antenatal Perineal Massage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beckmann|first=Michael M|last2=Stock|first2=Owen M|date=2013-04-30|title=Antenatal perineal massage for reducing perineal trauma|url=https://www.cochrane.org/CD005123/PREG_antenatal-perineal-massage-for-reducing-perineal-trauma|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|language=en|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005123.pub3|issn=1465-1858}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effectiveness==
A randomized clinical trials of perineal massage found similar results in the massage and control groups. They did find a reduced rate of class two and three level tears but did not find a reduction in the risk of pain, [[Urinary incontinence|urinary]] or [[fecal incontinence]], or [[dyspareunia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stamp|first=Georgina|last2=Kruzins|first2=Gillian|last3=Crowther|first3=Caroline|date=2001-05-26|title=Perineal massage in labour and prevention of perineal trauma: randomised controlled trial|journal=BMJ : British Medical Journal|volume=322|issue=7297|pages=1277–1280|issn=0959-8138|pmid=11375230|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  
The trail titled 'The possibility of antepartal prevention of episiotomy and perineal tears during delivery', concluded in 'Retrospective study at Nemocnice Český Krumlov, Methods: Between February 2014 and November 2015, 315 primiparous women questioned after a vaginal delivery, on the use of methods of birth injury prevention (vaginal dilatators EPI-NO and Aniball, perineal massage, natural methods – raspberry-leaf tea or linseed' concluded that 'There was a significantly higher number of women with intact perineum after the use of vaginal dilatators (43.1% vs.14.1% in control group (p &lt; 0.001)' and 'We also found a significant reduction of episiotomies in this group (29.3% vs. 57.7%, p &lt; 0.001).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dostálek L|first=Bohatá P|date=2016-08-01|title='Antepartální možnosti prevence epiziotomie a ruptury hráze při porodu': Randomised control trial|journal=Čes.

== Causes ==
Prenatal disabilities are acquired before birth. These may be due to diseases or substances that the mother has been exposed to during [[pregnancy]], embryonic or fetal developmental accidents or [[genetic disorder]]s.

Perinatal disabilities are acquired between some weeks before to up to four weeks after birth in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The free dictionary by Farlex|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/perinatal|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These can be due to prolonged [[Perinatal asphyxia|lack of oxygen]] or obstruction of the respiratory tract, damage to the brain during birth (due to the accidental misuse of [[Forceps in childbirth|forceps]], for example) or the baby being born [[Preterm birth|prematurely]]. These may also be caused due to genetic disorders or accidents.{{cn|date=May 2015}}

Post-natal disabilities are gained after birth. They can be due to accidents, [[injuries]], [[obesity]], [[infection]] or other [[illness]]es. These may also be caused due to genetic disorders.{{cn|date=May 2015}}

== Types ==
Mobility impairment includes physical defects, including upper or lower limb loss or impairment, poor [[manual dexterity]], and damage to one or multiple organs of the body. Disability in mobility can be a congenital or acquired problem or a consequence of disease. People who have a broken skeletal structure also fall into this category.

[[Visual impairment]] is another type of physical impairment. There are hundreds of thousands of people who suffer greatly from minor to various serious vision injuries or impairments. These types of injuries can also result in severe problems or diseases such as blindness and ocular trauma. Some other types of vision impairment include scratched [[cornea]], scratches on the [[sclera]], diabetes-related eye conditions, dry eyes and corneal graft, [[macular degeneration]] in old age and retinal detachment.  

[[Hearing loss]] is a partial or total inability to hear. Deaf and hard of hearing people have a rich culture and benefit from learning sign language for communication purposes.{{cn|date=June 2016}} People who are only partially deaf can sometimes make use of [[hearing aid]]s to improve their hearing ability.

Physical impairment can also be attributed to disorders causing, among others, sleep deficiency, chronic fatigue, chronic pain, and seizures.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7055">{{main article | Reproductive rights}}'''Pregnant patients rights''' refers to the choices and legal rights available to a mother experiencing pregnancy or childbirth. Specifically those under medical care within a medical establishment or those under the care of a medical professional regardless of location ( under care of paramedics at home, family doctor via phone, etc. ).

There are many debates that arise from pregnancy rights, ranging from whether or not [[Assisted reproductive technology|fertility treatments]] are ‘right’ or whether using [[surrogate mothers]] is wrong. It comes down to the mother’s right. As a woman, there are more challenges than just the fundamentals of the decisions surrounding their pregnancy. [[Maternity leave]], parental leave and the time allotted for these leaves varies from company to company.&lt;ref name=babycenter&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.babycenter.ca/pregnancy/work/maternityrights/ | title=Your pregnancy rights | year=2012 | accessdate=May 11, 2012}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) gathered in [[Cairo]] in September 1994 to discuss and “formulate a consensus position on population and development for the next 20 years”.&lt;ref name=McIntosh&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=2137493 | title=The Cairo conference on population and development: A new paradigm?. | author=McIntosh, C. A., &amp; Finkle, J. L. | journal=Population and Development Review | year=1995 | volume=21 | issue=2 | pages=223–260 | doi=10.2307/2137493}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the other goals was to make education and medical services available to women while they are pregnant, and when the time comes, have delivery options available. A main concern has always been [[postnatal]] care; people think that the hardest part is the birth of the child but there are so many additional concerns once the child is born and brought into this world. Complications both prior to pregnancy, during delivery, and after delivery are a potential concern in all births, the ICPD talked about enhancing the available support for all women.&lt;ref name=McIntosh/&gt; Pregnancy rights throughout the world are not going to be the same in every single place but the ICPD is aiming to eliminate discrimination during pregnancy and make all pregnant patients’ rights available to everyone.

Nurses and patients sometimes run into troubles because their opinions will often vary in what they think should be done in terms of termination or pre/post natal care.&lt;ref name=kane&gt;{{cite journal | title=Conscientious objection to termination of pregnancy: the competing rights of patients and nurses | author=Kane, R. | journal=Journal of Nursing Management | year=2009 | volume=17 | issue=7 | pages=907–912 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2834.2008.00888.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As Kane, 2009 states “The NMC code of professional conduct states that: ‘you must make the care of people your first concern”’ enforcing that the nurses opinions really should be kept to themselves so as to not influence the decision of the patients.

== Rights in Australia ==
In Australia pregnant women have the same rights as any other member of society. However, they do have some extra rights when it comes to their rights in the workforce.

=== Pregnant women' rights in the workforce ===
Under the Fair Work Act 2009 section &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.legislation.gov.au/Series/C2009A00028|title = Federal Register of Legislation|last =|first =|date =|website =|publisher =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt; pregnant women are still entitled to the same amount of sick leave as any other individual as being pregnant does not classify as an illness. A Pregnant woman however is able to take unpaid leave for "special maternity leave", this is maternity leave that she can take if she has a pregnancy related illness or the pregnancy ends any time after the first trimester due to a miscarriage, a stillbirth or a termination.

'''Safe jobs''' is when the women moves to a safer job while being because her original job is dangerous to her and the baby. She will need to provide evidence that she can still work but unable to perform the original tasks and how long she shouldn't work in her job for. An example for proving these would be with a medical certificate. In the circumstances where there is no safer jobs to offer the women can take no safe jobs leave. The employee takes paid leave if she is entitled to unpaid parental leave and unpaid leave if she is not.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Discrimination''' in the workforce against pregnant women is illegal. This means that she can not be fired, lose hours, demoted and treated differently because of her pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2004A01186|title = SEX DISCRIMINATION AMENDMENT (PREGNANCY AND WORK) ACT 2003 No. 103, 2003|last =|first =|date =|website =|publisher =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminating the pregnancy ==
In Australia the laws on termination change between each state and territory. In Western Australia termination is considered lawful up until 20 weeks of pregnancy. A termination after 20 weeks can only be undertaken if there is two medical practitioners from a panel of six that agree that the women or the fetus has or will have a serious medical condition if the pregnancy continued.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/rp9899/99rp01|title = Abortion Law in Australia|last =|first =|date =|website =|publisher =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Immunisation ==
During pregnancy, women have the right to seek getting immunised with the influenza vaccine "Flu Shot" and the adult dTpa vaccine (pertussis). Both of these vaccines are recommended however it is up to the individual whether or not to go ahead with the vaccinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.immunise.health.gov.au/internet/immunise/publishing.nsf/Content/pregnant-women|title = Immunise Australia Program|last =|first =|date =|website =|publisher =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2472">'''Progressive disease''' or '''progressive illness''' is a [[disease]] or physical ailment whose [[Course (medicine)|course]] in most cases is the worsening, growth, or spread of the disease. This may happen until [[death]], serious [[Debility (medical)|debility]], or [[organ failure]] occurs. Some progressive diseases can be halted and reversed by treatment. Many can be slowed by [[medical therapy]]. Some cannot be altered by current treatments.

Though the time distinctions are imprecise, diseases can be ''rapidly progressive'' (typically days to weeks) or ''slowly progressive'' (months to years). Virtually all slowly progressive diseases are also [[chronic disease]]s in terms of time course; many of these are also referred to as [[degenerative disease]]s. Not all chronic diseases are progressive: a chronic, non-progressive disease may be referred to as a ''static'' condition.

''Progressive disease'' can also be a [[clinical endpoint]] i.e. an endpoint in a clinical trial.

==Examples==
There are examples of slowly and rapidly progressive diseases affecting all [[organ systems]] and parts of the body. The following are some examples of rapidly and slowly progressive diseases affecting various organ systems:
*[[human brain|Brain]]: [[Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease]] progresses rapidly compared to [[Alzheimer's disease]].
*[[human eye|Eye]]s: [[Cataract]]s can be static or slowly progressive. [[Macular degeneration]] is slowly progressive, while [[retinal detachment]] is rapidly progressive.
*[[human lung|Lung]]s: [[Emphysema]] due to [[alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency]] is a slowly progressive [[pulmonary disease]].
*[[Kidney]]s: [[Goodpasture's syndrome]] is a rapidly progressive [[glomerulonephritis]], while [[diabetic glomerulosclerosis]] is slowly progressive.
*[[Pancreas]]: [[Type 1 diabetes mellitus]] involves rapidly progressive loss of [[insulin]] secretory capacity compared to [[type 2 diabetes mellitus]], in which the loss of insulin secretion is slowly progressive over many years. [[MODY 2]], due to ''GCK'' [[mutation]], is a relatively static form of reduced insulin secretion.
*[[Joint]]s: Both [[osteoarthritis]] and [[rheumatoid arthritis]] are slowly progressive forms of [[arthritis]].
*[[Nerve]]s: [[Essential tremor]] is a slowly progressive neurological disorder which is usually [[Heredity|genetically]] passed down.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7032">'''Self-rated health''' (also called Self-reported health, Self-assessed health, or perceived health) refers to both a single question such as “in general, would you say that your health is excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor?” and a survey questionnaire in which participants assess different dimensions of their own health. This survey technique is commonly used in [[health research]] for its ease of use and its power in measuring health.

==Single question==
Self-rated health measures the present general health and gives answer choices, typically structured like a [[Likert Scale]]. The self-rated health question may take different forms. It may be formulated as “in general, would you say that you health is excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor?” as the first question in the [[SF-36]] questionnaire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ware|first=John E|author2=Gandek, Barbara |title=Overview of the SF-36 Health Survey and the International Quality of Life Assessment (IQOLA) Project|journal=J Clin Epidemiol|date=1998|volume=51|issue=11|pages=903–912|doi=10.1016/s0895-4356(98)00081-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may also be formulated as “In general, how would you rate your health today,” with the possible choices being “very good” (1), “good” (2), “moderate” (3), “bad” (4) or “very bad” (5)” as used by the [[World Health Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Subramanian|first=SV |author2=Tim Huijts |author3=Mauricio Avendano|title=Self-rated health assessments in the 2002 World Health Survey: how do they correlate with education?|journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization|date=2010|volume=88|issue=2|pages=131–138|doi=10.2471/BLT.09.067058|url=http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/88/2/09-067058/en/|pmid=20428370|pmc=2814481}}&lt;/ref&gt; All questions do not necessarily have five answer choices; it can be more or less.

The self-rated health question is purposely vague so as to seize people’s own assessment of health according to their own definition of health.&lt;ref name="Snead2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Snead|first=Christine M.|title=Self-rated Health|journal=Blackwell Encyclopedia of Sociology|date=2007|pages=31–33|doi=10.1111/b.9781405124331.2007.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the answer to the self-rated health question is based on what people think—and thus is subjective—it is a statistically powerful predictor of [[Mortality rate|mortality]] in the general population.&lt;ref name="IdlerBenyamini1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Idler|first=Ellen L|author2=Benyamini, Yael |title=Self-rated health and mortality: a review of twenty-seven community studies.|journal=Journal of health and social behavior|date=1997|volume=38|issue=1|pages=21–37|doi=10.2307/2955359}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Singh-Manoux|first=A|last2=Dugravot|first2=A|last3=Shipley|first3=MJ, et al.|title=The association between self-rated health and mortality in different socioeconomic groups in the GAZEL cohort study|journal=International Journal of Epidemiology|publication-date=2007|volume=36|doi=10.1093/ije/dym170|pages=1222–1228|pmid=18025034|pmc=2610258|url=http://www.hal.inserm.fr/inserm-00226357/document}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Franks|first=P|last2=Gold|first2=M|last3=Fiscella|first3=K|date=2003|title=Sociodemographics, self-rated health, and mortalityin the US|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|volume=56|doi=10.1016/s0277-9536(02)00281-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Methodological strength===

====Validity====
The strong association between self-rated health and mortality&lt;ref name="IdlerBenyamini1997" /&gt; is used as proof that this measurement is [[Validity (logic)|valid]], because mortality is considered as the most objective measurement of the general health of an individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Quesnel-Vallée|first=Amélie|title=Self-rated health: caught in the crossfire of the quest for 'true' health?|journal=International Journal of Epidemiology|date=2007|volume=36|issue=6|pages=1161–4|doi=10.1093/ije/dym236|pmid=18056123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reliability====
The self-rated health question has been found to be a reliable measurement of general health since respondents rated the same general health assessment within a period where their health was unlikely to change.&lt;ref name="LundbergManderbacka1996"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lundberg|first=Olle|author2=Kristiina Manderbacka |title=Assessing reliability of a measure of self-rated health|journal=Scandinavian Journal of Public Health|year=1996|volume=24|pages=218–224|doi=10.1177/140349489602400314|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the reliability of the measurement, the self-rated health question “in general, would you say that you health is excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor?” is particularly vague. Thus, this measurement has low level in reliability test than other self-rated measurements that assess a more specific aspect of health.&lt;ref name="LundbergManderbacka1996" /&gt;

'''Interval between response options.''' 

The response options of the self-rated health question are unevenly spaced, substantially (excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor). Perneger et al. recommended coding response options unevenly, in proportion to the underlying construct of health and, based on Swiss data, proposed "poor health" as 1, "fair" as 2, "good" as 3.7, "very good" as 4.5, and "excellent" as 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Perneger|first=Thomas V.|last2=Gayet-Ageron|first2=Angèle|last3=Courvoisier|first3=Delphine S.|last4=Agoritsas|first4=Thomas|last5=Cullati|first5=Stéphane|date=2013|title=Self-rated health: analysis of distances and transitions between response options|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s11136-013-0418-5|journal=Quality of Life Research|language=en|volume=22|issue=10|pages=2761–2768|doi=10.1007/s11136-013-0418-5|issn=0962-9343|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Questionnaires==
Self-rated health, as measured by a questionnaire, attempts to measure health in all its dimensions. In such a questionnaire, participants answer a series of questions which are typically structured using a [[Likert Scale]]. The [[SF-36]] questionnaire is an example of tool for self-assessed overall health. The [[SF-36]] questionnaire addresses several dimensions of physical and mental health.

==Uses of self-rated health==
Considering that self-reported health is a powerful predictor of mortality&lt;ref name="IdlerBenyamini1997" /&gt; and considering its easy application, this subjective measure of health is often used in [[health research]] and large-scale surveys.&lt;ref name="Snead2007" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fayers|first=Peter|title=Assessing Quality Of Life In Clinical Trials: Methods And Practice|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; This measure helps follow the evolution of health across time and between populations.

The questionnaire is designed so that each question has a two-part answer. The first part asks the interviewee to list up to nine people available to provide support that meet the criteria stated in the question. These support individuals are specified using their initials in addition to the relationship to the interviewee.&lt;ref name="BioPsychoSocial Assessment Tools for the Elderly"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://instruct.uwo.ca/kinesiology/9641/Assessments/Social/SSQ.html|title=BioPsychoSocial Assessment Tools for the Elderly - Assessment Summary Sheet|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Example questions from the first part includes questions such as “Whom could you count on to help if you had just been fired from your job or expelled from school?” and “Whom do you feel would help if a family member very close to you died?”.&lt;ref name="A Brief Measure of Social Support" /&gt;

The second part asks the interviewee to specify how satisfied they are with each of the people stated in the first part. The SSQ respondents use a 6 -point [[Likert scale]] to indicate their degree of satisfaction with the support from the above people ranging from “1 - very dissatisfied” to “6 - very satisfied”.&lt;ref name="A Brief Measure of Social Support" /&gt;

The Social Support Questionnaire has multiple short forms such as the SSQ3 and the SSQ6.

==History of the SSQ==
The SSQ is based on 4 original studies. The first study set out to determine whether the SSQ had the desired psychometric properties. The second study tried to relate SSQ and a diversity of personality measures such as [[anxiety]], depression and hostility in connection with the Multiple Affect Adjective Checklist. The third study considered the relationship between social support, the prior year’s negative and positive life events, internal-external locus of control and self- esteem in conjunction with the Life Experiences Survey. The fourth study tested the idea that social support could serve as a buffer when faced with difficult life situations via trying to solve a maze and subsequently completing the Cognitive Interference Questionnaire.&lt;ref name="ADA100464" /&gt;

==Scoring==
The overall support score (SSQN) is calculated by taking an average of the individual scores across the 27 items.&lt;ref name="BioPsychoSocial Assessment Tools for the Elderly" /&gt; A high score on the SSQ indicates more optimism about life than a low score. Respondents with low SSQ scores have a higher prevalence of negative life events and illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sarason|first=|year=1985|title=Concomitants of Social Support: Social Skills, Physical Attractiveness and Gender|url=http://www.dtic.mil/get-tr-doc/pdf?AD=ADA141884|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=49|pages=469–480|via=|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.49.2.469}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scoring is as follows:

1. Add the total number of people for all 27 items (questions). (Max. is 243). Divide by 27 for average item score. This gives you SSQ Number Score, or SSQN.

2. Add the total satisfaction scores for all 27 items (questions). (Max is 162). Divide by 27 for average item score. This gives you SSQ Satisfaction score or SSQS.

3. Finally, you can average the above for  the total number of people that are family members - this results in the SSQ family score.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.agedcaretests.com/The_Social_Support_Questionnaire_(SSQ)_SAMPLE.pdf|title=Social Support Questionnaire Sample|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reliability==
According to Sarason, the SSQ takes between fifteen to eighteen minutes to properly administer and has “good” test-retest reliability.&lt;ref name="A Brief Measure of Social Support" /&gt;

==Validity==
The SSQ was compared with the depression scale and validity tests show significant negative correlation ranging from -0.22 to -0.43. The SSQ and the optimism scale have a correlation of 0.57. The SSQ and the satisfaction score have a correlation of 0.34.&lt;ref name="A Brief Measure of Social Support" /&gt; The SSQ has high [[internal consistency]] among items.&lt;ref name="ADA100464" /&gt;

==Linkages==
The SSQ has been used to show a positive [[correlation and dependence]] between Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and Social Support in a study of adolescents and long-term outcomes in Gonaives, Haiti. The study looked at the traumas stemming from the natural disasters of 2004, 2008 and 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Multi-natural disasters in Gonaïves Haiti: long-term outcomes among child and adolescents and social support. | pmid=25585481 | volume=16 | journal=Int J Emerg Ment Health | pages=292–7 | last1 = Derivois | first1 = D | last2 = Cénat | first2 = JM | last3 = Mérisier | first3 = GG}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SSQ has also been used to show that higher levels of social support correlated with less suicide ideation in Military Medical University Soldiers in Iran in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=A Structural Equation Modeling of the Relationships between Depression, Drug Abuse and&amp;nbsp;Social Support&amp;nbsp;with Suicidal Ideation among Soldiers in Iran in 2015 | pmid=28087854 | volume=16 | journal=J Res Health Sci | pages=212–216 | last1 = Nosratabadi | first1 = M | last2 = Halvaiepour | first2 = Z}}&lt;/ref&gt; A low level of social support is an important risk factor in women for [[dysmenorrhea]] or menstrual cramps.

==Related Surveys==

=== SSQ3 ===

The SSQ3 is a short form of the SSQ and has only three questions. The SSQ3 has acceptable test-test reliability and correlation with personality variables as compared to the long form of the Social Support Questionnaire. The internal reliability was borderline but this low level of internal reliability is as expected since there are only three questions.&lt;ref name="Social Support Questionnaire" /&gt;

=== SSQ6 ===

The SSQ6 is a short form of the SSQ. The SSQ6 has been shown to have high correlation with: the SSQ, SSQ personality variables and internal reliability. In the development of the SSQ6, the research suggests that professed social support in adults may be a connected to “early attachment experience.”&lt;ref name="Social Support Questionnaire" /&gt; The SSQ6 consists of the below 6 questions:

1. Whom can you really count on to be dependable when you need help?

2. Whom can you really count on to help you feel more relaxed when you are under pressure or tense?

3. Who accepts you totally, including both your worst and your best points?

4. Whom can you really count on to care about you, regardless of what is happening to you?

5. Whom can you really count on to help you feel better when you are feeling generally down-in-the-dumps?

6. Whom can you count on to console you when you are very upset?&lt;ref name="BioPsychoSocial Assessment Tools for the Elderly" /&gt;

===Interpersonal Support Evaluation List (ISEL)===

The Interpersonal Support Evaluation List includes 40 items (questions) with four sub-scales in the areas of Tangible Support, Belonging Support, Self-Esteem Support and Appraisal Support. The interviewee rates each item based on how true or false they feel the item is for themselves. The four total response options are “Definitely True”, “Probably True”, “Probably False”, and “Definitely False”.&lt;ref name="Social Support Questionnaire" /&gt;

'''Subjective well-being''' ('''SWB''') is a self-reported measure of [[well-being]], typically obtained by questionnaire.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.oecd.org/site/worldforum06/38331839.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160107223341/http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/well-being/publications/measuring-subjective-well-being-in-the-uk.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ed Diener]] developed a tripartite model of subjective well-being in 1984, which describes how people experience the [[quality of life|quality of their lives]] and includes both [[emotion]]al reactions and [[cognitive]] judgments.&lt;ref name="Diener1984"&gt;{{cite journal|last= Diener|first=Ed| title= Subjective well-being|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year= 1984|volume= 95|pages=542–575|url= http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/bul/95/3/542/|issue=3|doi= 10.1037/0033-2909.95.3.542|pmid= 6399758}}&lt;/ref&gt; It posits "three distinct but often related components of wellbeing: frequent positive [[affect (psychology)|affect]], infrequent negative [[affect (psychology)|affect]], and cognitive evaluations such as [[life satisfaction]]."&lt;ref&gt;Tov &amp; Diener (2013), ''Subjective Well-Being''. Research Collection School of Social Sciences. Paper 1395. http://ink.library.sju.edu.sg/soss_research/1395&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/49658154_A_Review_of_the_Tripartite_Structure_of_Subjective_Well-Being_Implications_for_Conceptualization_Operationalization_Analysis_and_Synthesis&lt;/ref&gt;

SWB therefore encompasses [[mood (psychology)|moods]] and emotions as well as evaluations of one's satisfaction with general and specific areas of one's life.&lt;ref name=Diener1999&gt;{{cite journal|last= Diener|first=Ed |author2=Suh, E.M. |author3=Lucas, R.E. |author4=Smith, H.L|title=Subjective well-being: Three Decades of Progress|journal= Psychological Bulletin |year=1999|volume=125|pages=276–302|url =http://stat.psych.uiuc.edu/~ediener/Documents/Diener-Suh-Lucas-Smith_1999.pdf|doi= 10.1037/0033-2909.125.2.276|issue= 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concepts encompassed by SWB include [[happiness]]. 

SWB tends to be stable over time&lt;ref name=Diener1999/&gt; and is strongly related to [[personality psychology|personality traits]].&lt;ref name=Steel&gt;{{cite journal|last= Steel|first=Piers |author2=Schmidt, Joseph |author3=Shultz, Jonas|title=Refining the relationship between personality and Subjective well-being|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=2008|volume=134|pages=138–161|url=http://www.subjectpool.com/ed_teach/y4person/3_happiness/Steel2008_5FM_and_happiness_psych_bull.pdf|doi= 10.1037/0033-2909.134.1.138|pmid= 18193998|issue= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that health and SWB may mutually influence each other, as good health tends to be associated with greater happiness,&lt;ref name=Okunmeta-analysis/&gt; and a number of studies have found that positive emotions and [[optimism]] can have a beneficial influence on health.&lt;ref name=Dienerhealth/&gt;

==Construction of SWB==
[[Ed Diener|Diener]] et al.  argued that the various components of SWB represent distinct constructs that need to be understood separately, even though they are closely related. Hence, SWB may be considered "a general area of scientific interest rather than a single specific construct".&lt;ref name=Diener1999/&gt; Due to the specific focus on the ''subjective'' aspects of well-being, definitions of SWB typically exclude ''objective'' conditions such as material conditions or [[health]], although these can influence ratings of SWB.&lt;ref name=Diener1984/&gt; Definitions of SWB therefore focus on how a person evaluates his/her own life, including emotional experiences of [[pleasure]] versus [[suffering|pain]] in response to specific events and cognitive evaluations of what a person considers a [[Eudaimonia|good life]].&lt;ref name=Diener2000/&gt; Components of SWB relating to [[Affect (psychology)|affect]] include positive affect (experiencing pleasant emotions and moods) and low negative affect (experiencing unpleasant, distressing emotions and moods), as well as "overall affect" or "[[valence (psychology)|hedonic]] balance", defined as the overall equilibrium  between positive and negative affect, and usually measured as the difference between the two.&lt;ref name=Steel/&gt;  High positive affect and low negative affect are often highly correlated, but not always.&lt;ref name=Diener2000/&gt;

==Components of SWB==
There are two components of SWB. One is [[affect (psychology)|Affective Balance]] and the other is Life Satisfaction. An individual's scores on the two measures are summed to produce a total SWB score. In some cases, these scores are kept separate.&lt;ref name="Diener &amp; Biswas-Diener" /&gt;
* Affective balance
Affective balance refers to the emotions, moods, and feelings a person has. These can be all positive, all negative, or a combination of both positive and negative.&lt;ref name="Diener &amp; Biswas-Diener" /&gt; Some research shows also that feelings of reward are separate from positive and negative affect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = White | first1 = M | last2 = Dolan | first2 = P | year = 2009 | title = Accounting for the richness of our daily activities | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2009.02392.x | pmid = 19549079 | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 20 | issue = 8| pages = 1000–1008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Life satisfaction
[[Life satisfaction]] (global judgments of one's life) and satisfaction with specific life domains (e.g. work satisfaction) are considered cognitive components of SWB.&lt;ref name=Diener2000/&gt; The term "[[happiness]]" is also commonly used in regards to SWB and has been defined variously as "satisfaction of desires and goals" (therefore related to life satisfaction), as a "preponderance of positive over negative affect" (therefore related to emotional components of SWB),&lt;ref name=Diener1984/&gt; as "contentment",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Graham|first1=Michael C.|title=Facts of Life: ten issues of contentment|date=2014|publisher=Outskirts Press|isbn=978-1-4787-2259-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a "consistent, [[optimistic]] mood state"&lt;ref name=Steel/&gt; and may imply an affective evaluation of one's life as a whole.&lt;ref name=deneve&amp;cooper&gt;{{cite journal|last=DeNeve|first=Kristina M.|author2=Cooper, Harris |title=The Happy Personality: A Meta-Analysis of 137 Personality Traits and Subjective Well-Being|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=1998|volume=124|pages=197–229|url=http://www.subjectpool.com/ed_teach/y5_ID/personality/wellbeing/1998_Deneve_cooper_psych_bull.pdf|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.124.2.197|pmid=9747186|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Life satisfaction can also be known as the "stable" component in one's life.&lt;ref name=Diener1984/&gt;  Affective concepts of SWB can be considered in terms of momentary emotional states as well as in terms of longer-term moods and tendencies (i.e. how much positive and/or negative affect a person generally experiences over any given period of time).&lt;ref name=Diener1999/&gt; Life satisfaction and in some research happiness are typically considered over long durations, up to one's lifetime.&lt;ref name=Steel/&gt; "[[Quality of life]]" has also been studied as a conceptualization of SWB. Although its exact definition varies, it is usually measured as an aggregation of well-being across several life domains and may include both subjective and objective components.&lt;ref name=Steel/&gt;

===Measurement of SWB components===

Life satisfaction and Affect balance are generally measured separately and independently.&lt;ref name=Albuquerque /&gt;  
* Life satisfaction is generally measured using a self-report method. A common measurement for life satisfaction is questionnaires. 
* Affective balance is also generally measured using a self-report method. An example of a measurement of affective balance is the [[Positive and Negative Affect Schedule|PANAS]] (Positive Affect Negative Affect Schedule).&lt;ref name=Albuquerque /&gt;  
Sometimes a single SWB question attempts to capture an overall picture.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. "''The most basic way of measuring it involves asking individuals how they feel about their lives - known as subjective well being. A typical question is, "Taking all things together, how happy are you?" - with possible answers from 0 (extremely unhappy) to 10 (extremely happy).''" Can Happiness be Measured?, http://www.actionforhappiness.org/why-happiness&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue with the such measurements of life satisfaction and affective balance is that they are self-reports. The problem with self-reports is that the participants may be lying or at least not telling the whole truth on the questionnaires. Participants may be lying or holding back from revealing certain things because they are either embarrassed or they may be filling in what they believe the researcher wants to see in the results. To gain more accurate results, other methods of measurement have been used to determine one’s SWB. 

Another way to corroborate or confirm that the self-report results are accurate is through informant reports.&lt;ref name=Albuquerque /&gt;  Informant reports are given to the participant’s closest friends and family and they are asked to fill out either a survey or a form asking about the participants mood, emotions, and overall lifestyle. The participant may write in the self-report that they are very happy, however that participant’s friends and family record that he/she is always depressed. This would obviously be a contradiction in results which would ultimately lead to inaccurate results. 

Another method of gaining a better understanding of the true results is through ESM, or the Experience Sampling Method.&lt;ref name=Albuquerque /&gt;  In this measure, participants are given a beeper/pager that will randomly ring throughout the day. Whenever the beeper/pager sounds, the participant will stop what he/she is doing and record the activity they are currently engaged in and their current mood and feelings. Tracking this over a period of a week or a month will give researchers a better understanding of the true emotions, moods, and feelings the participant is experiencing, and how these factors interact with other thoughts and behaviors.&lt;ref name= HGIN&gt;{{cite journal |author1=van der Krieke et al., L. | year = 2015 | title = HowNutsAreTheDutch (HoeGekIsNL): A crowdsourcing study of mental symptoms and strengths | journal = International Journal of Methods in Psychiatric Research | volume = 25| issue = 2| pages = 123–44| doi=10.1002/mpr.1495 | pmid=26395198}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third measurement to ensure validity is the Day Reconstruction Method.&lt;ref name=Albuquerque /&gt;  In this measure, participants fill out a diary of the previous days’ activities. The participant is then asked to describe each activity and provide a report of how they were feeling, what mood they were experiencing, and any emotions that surfaced. Thus to ensure valid results, a researcher may tend to use self-reports along with another form of measurement mentioned above. Someone with a high level of life satisfaction and a positive affective balance is said to have a high level of SWB.&lt;ref name=Albuquerque /&gt;

==Theories==
Theories of the causes of SWB tend to emphasise either top-down or bottom-up influences.&lt;ref name="Diener1984"/&gt;

===Top-down perspective===

In the top-down view, global features of personality influence the way a person perceives events. Individuals may therefore have a global tendency to perceive life in a consistently positive or negative manner, depending on their stable personality traits.&lt;ref name=deneve1999&gt;{{cite journal|last=DeNeve|first=Kristina M. |title=Happy as an Extraverted Clam? The Role of Personality for Subjective Well-Being
|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science
|year=1999|volume=8|pages=141–144|url=http://cdp.sagepub.com/content/8/5/141.abstract|issue=5|doi=10.1111/1467-8721.00033}}&lt;/ref&gt; Top-down theories of SWB suggest that people have a [[genetic predisposition]] to be happy or unhappy and this predisposition determines their SWB "setpoint". Set Point theory implies that a person's baseline or equilibrium level of SWB is a consequence of hereditary characteristics and therefore, almost entirely predetermined at birth.&lt;ref name="Happiness Is a Stochastic Phenomenon"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lykken|author2=Tellegen |title=Happiness Is a Stochastic Phenomenon|journal=Psychological Science|year=1996|volume=7|issue=3|doi= 10.1111/j.1467-9280.1996.tb00355.x |url=http://www.theiahe.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Happiness-is-a-Stochastic-Phenomenon.-by-David-Lykken-and-Auke-Tellegen.-APS.-May-1996.pdf|first1=David|pages=186–189 |citeseerx=10.1.1.613.4004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Evidence for this genetic predisposition derives from behavior-genetic studies that have found that positive and negative affectivity each have high [[heritability]] (40% and 55% respectively in one study).&lt;ref name=Diener1999/&gt; Numerous twin studies confirm the notion of set point theory, however, they do not rule out the possibility that is it possible for individuals to experience long term changes in SWB.&lt;ref name="Happiness Is a Stochastic Phenomenon"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first = Matt |last=McGue |author2=Bacon, Steve |author3=Lykken, David|title=Personality stability and change in early adulthood: A behavioral genetic analysis|journal=Developmental Psychology|year=1993|volume=29|issue=1|pages=96–109 |url =  http://psych.colorado.edu/~carey/pdfFiles/Personality_McGue01.pdf|doi = 10.1037/0012-1649.29.1.96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diener et al. note that heritability studies are limited in that they describe long-term SWB in a sample of people in a modern [[western society]] but may not be applicable to more extreme environments that might influence SWB and do not provide absolute indicators of genetic effects. Additionally, heritability estimates are inconsistent across studies.

Further evidence for a genetically influenced predisposition to SWB comes from findings that personality has a large influence on long-term SWB. This has led to the ''dynamic equilibrium model'' of SWB. This model proposes that personality provides a baseline for emotional responses. External events may move people away from the baseline, sometimes dramatically, but these movements tend to be of limited duration, with most people returning to their baseline eventually.&lt;ref name=Diener1999/&gt;

===Bottom-up perspective===

From a bottom-up perspective, happiness represents an accumulation of happy experiences. Bottom-up influences include external events, and broad situational and demographic factors, including health and marital status. Bottom-up approaches are based on the idea that there are universal [[basic human needs]] and that happiness results from their fulfilment. In support of this view, there is evidence that daily pleasurable events are associated with increased positive affect, and daily unpleasant events or hassles are associated with increased negative affect.

However, research suggests that external events account for a much smaller proportion of the variance in self-reports of SWB than top-down factors, such as personality.&lt;ref name=Diener1999/&gt; A theory proposed to explain the limited impact of external events on SWB is hedonic adaptation.&lt;ref name=Diener2000/&gt; Based originally on the concept of a "[[hedonic treadmill]]", this theory proposes that positive or negative external events temporarily increase or decrease feelings of SWB, but as time passes people tend to become habituated to their circumstances and have a tendency to return to a personal SWB "setpoint" or baseline level.

The hedonic treadmill theory originally proposed that most people return to a neutral level of SWB (i.e. neither happy nor unhappy) as they habituate to events. However, subsequent research has shown that for most people, the baseline level of SWB is at least mildly positive, as most people tend to report being at least somewhat happy in general and tend to experience positive mood when no adverse events are occurring. Additional refinements to this theory have shown that people do not adapt to all life events equally, as people tend to adapt rapidly to some events (e.g. imprisonment), slowly to others (e.g. the death of a loved one), and not at all to others (e.g. noise and sex).&lt;ref name=Diener2000/&gt;

==Factors affecting SWB==

===Personality and genetics===
A number of studies have found that SWB constructs are strongly associated with a range of personality traits, including those in the [[five factor model]].&lt;ref name=Steel/&gt; Findings from numerous personality studies show that genetics account for 20-48% of the variance in Five-Factor Model and the variance in subjective well-being is also heritable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Bouchard | first = Thomas J., Jr. |author2=Loehlin, J.C.  | year = 2001 | title = Genes, evolution, and personality | journal = Behavior Genetics | volume = 31 | pages = 243–273 | doi =  10.1023/A:1012294324713 | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/qt0138g23w8720j1/ | issue = 3 | pmid = 11699599}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, [[neuroticism]] predicts poorer subjective well-being whilst [[extraversion]], [[agreeableness]], [[conscientiousness]] and [[openness to experience]] tend to predict higher subjective well-being. A [[meta-analysis]] found that neuroticism, extraversion, agreeableness, and conscientiousness were significantly related to all facets of SWB examined (positive, negative, and overall affect; happiness; life satisfaction; and quality of life). Neuroticism was the strongest predictor of overall SWB and is the strongest predictor of negative affect.&lt;ref name=Steel/&gt;

A large number of personality traits are related to SWB constructs, although [[intelligence]] has negligible relationships.&lt;ref name=deneve&amp;cooper/&gt; Positive affect is most strongly predicted by extraversion, to a lesser extent agreeableness, and more weakly by openness to experience. Happiness was most strongly predicted by extraversion, and also strongly predicted by neuroticism, and to a lesser extent by the other three factors. Life satisfaction was significantly predicted by neuroticism, extraversion, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. Quality of life was very strongly predicted by neuroticism, and also strongly predicted by extraversion and conscientiousness, and to a modest extent by agreeableness and openness to experience.&lt;ref name=Steel/&gt;   One study found that subjective well-being was genetically indistinct from personality traits, especially those that reflected emotional stability (low Neuroticism), and social and physical activity (high Extraversion), and constraint (high Conscientiousness).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Weiss | first = A. |author2=Bates, T. C. |author3=Luciano, M.  |year = 2008 | title = Happiness is a personal(ity) thing: The genetics of personality and well-being in a representative sample |journal = Psychological Science | volume = 19 |pages = 205–210 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02068.x | pmid = 18315789 | issue = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DeNeve (1999) argued that there are three trends in the relationship between personality and SWB. Firstly, SWB is closely tied to traits associated with emotional tendencies ([[neuroticism#Emotional stability|emotional stability]], positive affectivity, and tension). Secondly, relationship enhancing traits (e.g. [[trust (social sciences)|trust]], affiliation) are important for subjective well-being. Happy people tend to have strong relationships and be good at fostering them. Thirdly, the way people think about and explain events is important for subjective well-being. Appraising events in an [[optimistic]] fashion, having a sense of control, and making active coping efforts facilitates subjective well-being. Trust, a trait substantially related to SWB, as opposed to cynicism involves making positive rather than negative attributions about others. Making positive, optimistic attributions rather than negative pessimistic ones facilitates subjective well-being.&lt;ref name=deneve1999/&gt;

The related trait of [[eudaimonia]] or [[psychological well-being]], is also heritable.

===Social influences===
{{expand section|date=December 2012}}
A person's level of subjective well-being is determined by many different factors and social influences prove to be a strong one. Results from the famous [[Framingham Heart Study]] indicate that friends three [[degrees of separation]] away (that is, friends of friends of friends) can affect a person's happiness. From abstract: "A friend who lives within a mile (about 1.6 km) and who becomes happy increases the probability that a person is happy by 25%."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fowler|first=J. H|author2=Christakis, N. A |title=Dynamic spread of happiness in a large social network: longitudinal analysis over 20 years in the Framingham Heart Study|journal=BMJ|date=4 December 2008|volume=337|issue=dec04 2|pages=a2338|doi=10.1136/bmj.a2338|pmid=19056788|pmc=2600606}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wealth===
Research indicates that wealth is related to many positive outcomes in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Furnham &amp; Argyle|title=The psychology of money|year=1998|publisher=Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such outcomes include: improved health and mental health,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Langner &amp; Michael|title=Life stress and mental health: The Midtown Manhattan study|year=1963|publisher=Free Press of Glencoe  (New York)}}&lt;/ref&gt; greater longevity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilkinson|title=Unhealthy societies: the afflictions of inequality|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; lower rates of infant mortality,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith |author2=Eikeseth |author3=Klevstrand |author4=Lovaas |title=Intensive behavioral treatment for preschoolers with severe mental retardation and pervasive developmental disorder|journal=American Journal on Mental Retardation|year=1997|volume=102|issue=3|pages=238–249|doi=10.1352/0895-8017(1997)102&lt;0238:IBTFPW&gt;2.0.CO;2|pmid=9394133|first1=T}}&lt;/ref&gt; experience fewer stressful life events,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wilson | first1 = RM | last2 = Runciman | first2 = WB | last3 = Gibberd | first3 = RW | last4 = Harrison | first4 = BT | last5 = Newby | first5 = L | last6 = Hamilton | first6 = JD.  | year = 1995 | title = The quality in Australian health care study | url = | journal = Med J Aust | volume = 163 | issue = | pages = 458–471 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and less frequently the victims of violent crimes&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, J.

New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; However, research suggests that wealth has a smaller impact on SWB than people generally think, even though higher incomes do correlate substantially with life satisfaction reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aknin|author2=Norton, Dunn |title=From wealth to well-being? Money matters, but less than people think|journal=The Journal of Positive Psychology|year=2009|volume=4|issue=6|pages=523–527|doi=10.1080/17439760903271421|first1=Lara B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relative influence of [[wealth]] together with other material components on overall subjective [[well-being]] of a person is being studied through new researches. The Well-being Project at Human Science Lab investigates how material [[well-being]] and [[perceptual]] well-being works as relative determinants in conditioning our [[mind]] for positive [[emotion]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://humansciencelab.org.uk| title=Understanding Positive Emotions |publisher=Human Science Lab | access-date=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study done by Aknin, Norton, &amp; Dunn (2009), researchers asked participants from across the income spectrum to report their own happiness and to predict the happiness of others and themselves at different income levels.  In study 1, predicted happiness ranged between 2.4-7.9 and actual happiness ranged between 5.2-7.7.  In study 2, predicted happiness ranged between 15-80 and actual happiness ranged between 50-80.  These findings show that people believe that money does more for happiness than it really does.&lt;ref&gt;Norton, M.I., Dunn, E.W., &amp; *Aknin, L.B. (2009). From wealth to well-being: Spending money on others promotes happiness. Invited talk at the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Tampa, FL&lt;/ref&gt; However, some research indicates that while [[socioeconomic]] measures of status do not correspond to greater happiness, measures of [[sociometric status]] (status compared to people encountered face-to-face on a daily basis) do correlate to increased subjective well-being, above and beyond the effects of extroversion and other factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anderson|first=C.|author2=Kraus, M. W. |author3=Galinsky, A. D. |author4= Keltner, D. |title=The Local-Ladder Effect: Social Status and Subjective Well-Being|journal=Psychological Science|date=31 May 2012|volume=23|issue=7|pages=764–771|doi=10.1177/0956797611434537 |pmid=22653798}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Easterlin Paradox also suggests that there is no connection between a society's [[economic]] development and its average level of [[happiness]].   Through time, the Easterlin has looked at the relationship between [[happiness]] and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) across countries and within countries.  There are three different phenomena to look at when examining the connection between money and Subjective well-being; rising GDP within a country, relative income within a country, and differences in GDP between countries.&lt;ref&gt;Easterlin,  Richard  A.,  1973,  Does  Money  Buy  Happiness?  The  Public  Interest,  30  (Winter),  3-10&lt;/ref&gt;

More specifically, when making comparisons between countries, a principle called the Diminishing Marginal Utility of Income (DMUI) stands strong.  Veenhoven (1991) said, "[W]e not only see a clear positive relationship [between happiness and GNP per capita], but also a curvilinear pattern; which suggest that wealth is subject to a law of diminishing happiness returns."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Veenhoven | first1 = Ruut | year = 1991 | title = Is Happiness Relative? | url = http://repub.eur.nl/pub/16148| journal = Social Indicators Research | volume = 24 | issue = 1| pages = 1–34 | doi=10.1007/bf00292648| format = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Meaning a $1,000 increase in real income, becomes progressively smaller the higher the initial level of income, having less of an impact on subjective well-being. Easterlin (1995) proved that the DMUI is true when comparing countries, but not when looking at rising gross domestic product within countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Easterlin | first1 = Richard A. | year = 1995 | title = Will Raising the Incomes of All Increase the Happiness of All? | url = | journal = Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization | volume = 27 | issue = 1| pages = 35–48 | doi=10.1016/0167-2681(95)00003-b}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health===
There are substantial positive associations between [[health]] and SWB so that people who rate their general health as "good" or "excellent" tend to experience better SWB compared to those who rate their health as "fair" or "poor". A meta-analysis found that self-ratings of general health were more strongly related to SWB than physician ratings of health.&lt;ref name=Okunmeta-analysis&gt;

A review of longitudinal studies found&lt;ref name="Diener &amp; Biswas-Diener" /&gt; that measures of baseline subjective well-being constructs such as [[optimism]] and positive affect predicted longer-term health status and mortality. Conversely, a number of studies found that baseline [[depression (mood)|depression]] predicted poorer longer-term health status and mortality. Baseline health may well have a causal influence on subjective well-being so causality is difficult to establish.
A number of studies found that positive emotions and optimism had a beneficial impact on cardiovascular health and on immune functioning. Changes in mood are also known to be associated with changes in immune and cardiovascular response.
There is evidence that interventions that are successful in improving subjective well-being can have beneficial effects on aspects of health. For example, [[meditation]] and [[relaxation training]] have been found to increase positive affect and to reduce blood pressure. The effect of specific types of subjective well-being is not entirely clear. For example, how durable the effects of mood and emotions on health are  remains unclear. Whether some types of subjective well-being predict health independently of others is also unclear.&lt;ref name=Dienerhealth/&gt; Meditation has the power to increase happiness because it can improve self-confidence and reduces anxiety, which increases your well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Howard|title=The Pursuit of Happiness|year=1953|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA|page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultivating personal strengths and resources, like humour, social/animal company, and daily occupations, also appears to help people preserve acceptable levels of SWB despite the presence of symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress.&lt;ref name="BosPrSWB" /&gt;

Research suggests that probing a patient's happiness is one of the most important things a doctor can do to predict that patient's health and longevity.&lt;ref name="Diener &amp; Biswas-Diener" /&gt;  In health-conscious modern societies, most people overlook the emotions as a vital component of one's health, while over focusing on diet and exercise. According to Diener &amp; Biswas-Diener, people who are happy become less sick than people who are unhappy. There are three types of health: morbidity, survival, and longevity.&lt;ref name="Diener &amp; Biswas-Diener" /&gt;  Evidence suggests that all three can be improved through happiness:

# Morbidity, simply put, is whether or not someone develops a serious illness, such as the flu or cancer.&lt;ref name="Diener &amp; Biswas-Diener" /&gt;  In a 30-year longitudinal study, participants who were high in positive emotions were found to have lower rates of many health problems. Some of these illnesses/problems include lower death rates from heart disease, suicide, accidents, homicides, mental illnesses, drug dependency, and liver disease related to alcoholism.  Additionally, results showed that depressed participants were more likely to have heart attacks and recurrences of heart attacks when compared to happy people.
# Survival is the term used for what happens to a person after he/she has already developed or contracted a serious illness.&lt;ref name="Diener &amp; Biswas-Diener" /&gt;  Although happiness has been shown to increase health, with survival, this may not be the case. Survival may be the only area of health that evidence suggests happiness may actually be sometimes detrimental. It is unclear why exactly research results suggest this is the case, however Diener &amp; Biswas-Diener offer an explanation. It is possible that happy people fail to report symptoms of the illness, which can ultimately lead to no treatment or inadequate treatment. Another possible reason may be that happy people tend to be optimistic, leading them to take their symptoms too lightly, seek treatment too late, and/or follow the doctor’s instructions half-heartedly. And lastly, Diener &amp; Biswas-Diener suggest that people with serious illnesses may be more likely to choose to live out the rest of their days without painful or invasive treatments.&lt;ref name="Diener &amp; Biswas-Diener" /&gt;
# Longevity, the third area of health, is measured by an individual's age of death.&lt;ref name="Diener &amp; Biswas-Diener" /&gt;  Head researcher Deborah Danner of the University of Kentucky researched links between an individual's happiness and that individual's longevity. Danner recruited 180 Catholic nuns from a nearby convent as the participants of her study. She chose nuns because they live very similar lives. This eliminates many confounding variables that might be present in other samples, which can lead to inaccurate results. Such confounding variables could include drug use, alcohol abuse, diet, and sexual risk-taking. Since there are few differences among the nuns as far as the confounding variables, this sample offered the best option to match a controlled laboratory setting. Results showed that nuns who were considered{{by whom|date=September 2014}} happy or positive in their manner and language on average lived 10 years longer than the nuns who were considered unhappy or negative in their manner and language. A follow-up study by health researcher Sarah Pressman examined 96 famous psychologists to determine if similar results from the nun research would be seen as well. Pressman's results showed that the positive or happy psychologists lived, on average, 6 years longer. The psychologists who were considered{{by whom|date=September 2014}} negative or unhappy lived, on average, 5 years less.&lt;ref name="Diener &amp; Biswas-Diener" /&gt;

===Physical characteristics===
A positive relationship has been found between the volume of gray matter in the right [[precuneus]] area of the brain, and the subject's subjective happiness score.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url=http://www.nature.com/articles/srep16891 | doi=10.1038/srep16891| pmid=26586449| pmc=4653620| title=The structural neural substrate of subjective happiness| journal=Scientific Reports| volume=5| pages=16891| year=2015| last1=Sato| first1=Wataru| last2=Kochiyama| first2=Takanori| last3=Uono| first3=Shota| last4=Kubota| first4=Yasutaka| last5=Sawada| first5=Reiko| last6=Yoshimura| first6=Sayaka| last7=Toichi| first7=Motomi}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 6 week [[mindfulness]] based intervention was found to correlate with a significant gray matter increase within the precuneus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 4306280 | pmid=25632405 | doi=10.17140/NOJ-1-106 | volume=1 | issue=1 | title=Brain Gray Matter Changes Associated with Mindfulness Meditation in Older Adults: An Exploratory Pilot Study using Voxel-based Morphometry | year=2014 | journal=Neuro | pages=23–26 | last1 = Kurth | first1 = F | last2 = Luders | first2 = E | last3 = Wu | first3 = B | last4 = Black | first4 = DS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leisure===
There are a number of domains that are thought to contribute to subjective well-being. In a study by Hribernik and Mussap (2010), leisure satisfaction was found to predict unique variance in life satisfaction, supporting its inclusion as a distinct life domain contributing to subjective well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hribernik | first1 = J. | last2 = Mussap | first2 = A. J. | year = 2010 | title = Research note: Leisure satisfaction and subjective well-being | url = | journal = Annals of Leisure Research | volume = 13 | issue = 4| pages = 701–708 | doi=10.1080/11745398.2010.9686871}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, relationship status interacted with age group and gender on differences in leisure satisfaction. The relationship between leisure satisfaction and life satisfaction, however, was reduced when considering the impact of core affect (underlying mood state). This suggests that leisure satisfaction may primarily be influenced by an individual's subjective well-being level as represented by core affect. This has implications for possible limitations in the extent to which leisure satisfaction may be improved beyond pre-existing levels of well-being and mood in individuals.

===Cultural variations===

Although all cultures seem to value happiness, cultures vary in how they define happiness. There is also evidence that people in more individualistic cultures tend to rate themselves as higher in subjective well-being compared to people in more collectivistic cultures.&lt;ref name=science&gt;
{{cite book
|title=The Science of Subjective Well-Being|year=2008|publisher=Guildford Press

| editor=Michael Eid &amp; Randy J. Larsen
| pages = 414–430
| chapter = Comparing subjective well-being across cultures and nations: the "what" and "why" questions}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Western culture]]s, predictors of happiness include elements that support personal independence, a sense of personal agency, and self-expression. In [[Eastern culture]]s, predictors of happiness focus on an interdependent self that is inseparable from significant others. Compared to people in individualistic cultures, people in collectivistic cultures are more likely to base their judgments of life satisfaction on how significant others appraise their life than on the balance of inner emotions experienced as pleasant versus unpleasant. Pleasant emotional experiences have a stronger social component in East Asian cultures compared to Western ones. For example, people in Japan are more likely to associate happiness with interpersonally engaging emotions (such as friendly feelings), whereas people in the United States are more likely to associate happiness with interpersonally disengaging emotions (pride, for example).&lt;ref name=science/&gt; There are also cultural differences in motives and goals associated with happiness. For example, Asian Americans tend to experience greater happiness after achieving goals that are pleasing to or approved of by significant others compared to European Americans. There is also evidence that high self-esteem, a sense of personal control and a consistent sense of identity relate more strongly to SWB in Western cultures than they do in Eastern ones. However, this is not to say that these things are unimportant to SWB in Eastern cultures. Research has found that even within Eastern cultures, people with high self-esteem and a more consistent sense of identity are somewhat happier than those who are low in these characteristics. There is no evidence that low self-esteem and so on{{vague|date=September 2014}} are actually beneficial to SWB in any known culture.&lt;ref name=science/&gt;

A large body of research evidence has confirmed that people in individualistic societies report higher levels of happiness than people in collectivistic ones and that socioeconomic factors alone are insufficient to explain this difference.&lt;ref name=science/&gt; In addition to political and economic differences, individualistic versus collectivistic nations reliably differ in a variety of psychological characteristics that are related to SWB, such as emotion norms and attitudes to the expression of individual needs. Collectivistic cultures are based around the belief that the individual exists for the benefit of the larger social unit, whereas more individualistic cultures assume the opposite. Collectivistic cultures emphasise maintaining social order and harmony and therefore expect members to suppress their personal desires when necessary in order to promote collective interests. Such cultures therefore consider self-regulation more important than self-expression or than individual rights. Individualistic cultures by contrast emphasise the inalienable value of each person and expect individuals to become self-directive and self-sufficient. Although people in collectivistic cultures may gain happiness from the social approval they receive from suppressing self-interest, research seems to suggest that self-expression produces a greater happiness "payoff" compared to seeking approval outside oneself.&lt;ref name=science/&gt;

===Positive psychology===
[[Positive psychology]] is particularly concerned with the study of SWB.&lt;ref name=Diener2000&gt;{{cite journal|last= Diener|first=Ed| title= Subjective well-being: The Science of Happiness and a Proposal for a National Index|journal=American Psychologist|year=2000|volume=55|pages=34–43|url=http://mina.education.ucsb.edu/janeconoley/ed197/documents/Dienersubjectivewell-being.pdf|doi= 10.1037/0003-066X.55.1.34|pmid= 11392863|issue= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sonja"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lyubomirsky|first=Sonja|title=Why are some happier than others?

P.|citeseerx=10.1.1.183.6660 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers in positive psychology have pointed out that in almost every [[culture]] studied the pursuit of happiness is regarded as one of the most valued goals in life. Understanding [[individual differences psychology|individual differences]] in SWB is of key interest in positive psychology, particularly the issue of why some people are happier than others. Some people continue to be happy in the face of adversity whereas others are chronically unhappy at the best of times.&lt;ref name=BosPrSWB&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bos, E.H.|author2=Snippe, E.|author3=de Jonge, P.|author4=Jeronimus, B.F.| year = 2016 | title = Preserving Subjective Wellbeing in the Face of Psychopathology: Buffering Effects of Personal Strengths and Resources | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 11| issue = 3| pages = e0150867| doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0150867 | pmid=26963923|pmc=4786317}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Positive psychology has investigated how people might improve their level of SWB and maintain these improvements over the longer term, rather than returning to baseline.&lt;ref name="Sonja"/&gt; [[Sonja Lyubomirsky|Lyubomirsky]] (2001) argued that SWB is influenced by a combination of personality/genetics (studies have found that genetic influences usually account for 35-50% of the variance in happiness measures), external circumstances, and activities that affect SWB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Røysamb | first1 = E. | last2 = Harris | first2 = J. | last3 = Magnus | first3 = P. | last4 = Vittersø | first4 = J. | last5 = Tambs | first5 = K. | year = 2002 | title = Subjective well-being.

==Content==

''The State of the World's Children 1982–1983'' launches the [[child survival revolution]] and pushed for [[GOBI]] (growth monitoring, [[oral rehydration therapy]], breastfeeding, and immunization).&lt;ref name="1980_1995"/&gt;

The 1988 report argues for the need of a "Grand Alliance" for children between governments, schools, mass media, etc., to continue the child survival and development revolution.&lt;ref name="1980_1995"/&gt;

The 1991 report features the [[World Summit for Children]], which happened the previous year. The report covers the commitment made by the Summit and serves as a record.&lt;ref name="1980_1995"/&gt;

The 2015 ''The State of the World's Children'' report, titled ''Reimagine the Future'', reviews the work on children's health and rights in the world in the context of the 25th anniversary of the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unicef.org/publications/files/SOWC_2015_Summary_and_Tables.pdf |title=THE STATE OF THE WORLD’S CHILDREN 2015: Executive Summary |publisher=UNICEF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crop.org/OtherResources/FurtherReading/UNICEF-The-State-of-the-Worlds-Children-in-Numbers-.aspx |title=UNICEF: The State of the World’s Children in Numbers |date=August 24, 2015 |accessdate=May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The report also argued that more innovation is necessary, and highlighted examples including Solar Ear (a solar-rechargeable [[hearing aid]] battery charger) and community-based management of acute malnutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://reliefweb.int/report/world/state-world-s-children-2015-reimagine-future-innovation-every-child |title=The State of the World’s Children 2015: Reimagine the future - Innovation for every child |date = November 20, 2014 |publisher=reliefweb |accessdate=May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4809">A '''third-party administrator'''  ('''TPA''') is an organization that processes [[insurance]] claims or certain aspects of [[employee benefit]] plans for a separate entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/healthcarecrisis/glossary.htm |author=PBS |title=Glossary of Healthcare terms |accessdate=2008-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also a term used to define organizations within the insurance industry which administer other services such as underwriting, customer service. This can be viewed as [[outsourcing]] the administration of the claims processing, since the TPA is performing a task traditionally handled by the company providing the insurance or the company itself. Often, in the case of insurance claims, a TPA handles the claims processing for an [[employer]] that self-insures its employees. Thus, the employer is acting as an [[insurance company]] and [[Underwriting#Insurance|underwrites]] the [[Financial risk|risk]].  The risk of loss remains with the employer, and not with the TPA. An insurance company may also use a TPA to manage its claims processing, provider networks, [[utilization review]], or membership functions. While some third-party administrators may operate as units of insurance companies, they are often independent.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Third-party administrators also handle many aspects of other employee benefit plans such as the processing of [[retirement plan]]s and [[flexible spending account]]s. Many employee benefit plans have highly technical aspects and difficult administration that can make using a specialized entity such as a TPA more cost effective than doing the same processing in house.

==Health care{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}==
Third-party administrators are prominent players in the health care industry and have the expertise and capability to administer all or a portion of the claims process. They are normally contracted by a health insurer or self-insuring companies to administer services, including claims administration, premium collection, enrollment and other administrative activities.  A hospital or provider organization desiring to set up its own health plan will often outsource certain responsibilities to a third-party administrator.

For example, an employer may choose to help finance the health care costs of its employees by contracting with a TPA to administer many aspects of a [[self-funded health care]] plan.

==Commercial general liability{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}==
This term is also now commonly used in [[commercial general liability]] (CGL) policies or so called "casualty" business. In these instances, the liability policies are written with a large (in excess of $50,000) [[self-insured retention]] (SIR) that operates somewhat like a deductible, but rather than being paid at the end of a claim (when a loss payment is made to a claimant), the money is paid up front by the insured for costs, expenses, attorney fees etc. as the claim moves forward. If there is a settlement or verdict within the SIR, then that is also paid by the insured up to the limit of the SIR, before the insurer steps in and pays its portion. The TPA acts like a claims adjuster for the insurance company and sometimes works in conjunction with the inside insurance company claims adjuster or an outside claims investigator as well as the defense counsel. The defense counsel in some situations is selected by the TPA. The point is that the larger the SIR, the more responsibility the TPA has over the control of the way the claim is handled and ultimately resolved. Some self-insured retentions are in the millions of dollars and the TPAs are large multinational non-insurance entities that handle all the claims. In contrast, some self-insureds choose not to outsource claims handling to a TPA, preferring instead to handle all claims in house. This is known as self-administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irmi.com/expert/articles/2008/armc11-insurance-claims-management.aspx|title=Is Self-Administration Ever the Right Answer?|work=irmi.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retirement plans==
Retirement plans such as a [[401(k)]] are often partly managed by an investment company. Instead of handling all the plan contributions by employees, distributions to employees, and other aspects of plan processing, the investment company may contract with a third-party administrator to handle much of the administrative work and only handle the remaining investment work.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4097">'''The vaginal cuff''' is the upper portion of the [[vagina]] that opens up into the [[peritoneum]] and is sutured shut after the removal of the [[cervix]] and [[uterus]] during a [[hysterectomy]].&lt;ref name="Hoffman_2012" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.medilexicon.com/dictionary/21790 | title = Vaginal Cuff - Medical Definition from MediLexicon | website = www.medilexicon.com | access-date = 2018-01-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The vaginal cuff is created by [[suturing]] together the edges of the surgical site where the cervix was attached to the vagina. This is accomplished by bringing the edges of the vagina together and suturing them together and to the [[Uterosacral ligament|uterosacral ligaments]] to prevent prolapse. The peritoneum is also sewn into the newly created vaginal cuff.&lt;ref name="Hoffman_2012"&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Barbara L. | last1 = Hoffman | first2 = J. Whitridge | last2 = Williams | name-list-format = vanc | title = Williams gynecology | date=2012 | publisher = McGraw-Hill Medical | isbn = 978-0-07-171672-7 | edition = 2nd | location = New York | pages = 1054 and 1050 | oclc = 779244257 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There may be an advantage to using one method of closure over another.&lt;ref name="Cronin_2012" /&gt; The vaginal cuff has a tendency to partially or completely [[Wound dehiscence|dehisce]] or open up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jelovsek JE, Maher C, Barber MD | title = Pelvic organ prolapse | journal = Lancet | volume = 369 | issue = 9566 | pages = 1027–38 | date = March 2007 | pmid = 17382829 | doi = 10.1016/s0140-6736(07)60462-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Michael L. | last = Sprague | name-list-format = vanc | date = January 2016| url = http://www.clevelandclinicmeded.com/live/courses/MIGS/presentations/0131_0730_Closure%20of%20the%20Vaginal%20Cuff_Sprague.pdf | title = Closure of the Vaginal Cuff Following Hysterectomy: Prevention and Management of Dehiscence | website = The Cleveland Clinic }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A further complication that can accompany the dehiscence of the vaginal cuff is [[Pelvic evisceration|evisceration]] or the movement of [[intestines]] into the vagina.&lt;ref name="Cronin_2012"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cronin B, Sung VW, Matteson KA | title = Vaginal cuff dehiscence: risk factors and management | journal = American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 206 | issue = 4 | pages = 284–8 | date = April 2012 | pmid = 21974989 | pmc = 3319233 | doi = 10.1016/j.ajog.2011.08.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some or all of the vaginal cuff can reopen.&lt;ref name="Hur_2016"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hur HC, Lightfoot M, McMillin MG, Kho KA | title = Vaginal cuff dehiscence and evisceration: a review of the literature | journal = Current Opinion in Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 28 | issue = 4 | pages = 297–303 | date = August 2016 | pmid = 27310715 | doi = 10.1097/gco.0000000000000294 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The risk of vaginal cuff complications is related to the approach to hysterectomy: robotic-assisted total [[laparoscopic]] hysterectomy, total [[laparoscopic hysterectomy]], laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy, total abdominal hysterectomy, and total vaginal hysterectomy.&lt;ref name="Hur_2016" /&gt;

The vaginal cuff can be stressed by sexual intercourse, [[chronic constipation]], [[asthma]], [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease|COPD]], and other actions that increase intra-abdominal pressure. This structure is prone to infection, [[hematoma]] and other postoperative complications. Factors that are thought to affect wound healing are radiation treatments, age, [[pelvic organ prolapse]], the use of [[corticosteroids]], concurrent malignancy.&lt;ref name="Hur_2016" /&gt;

Though rare, estimates of the prevalence of vaginal cuff dehiscence are difficult to assess due to the presence of only case studies and anecdotal reports.&lt;ref name="Cronin_2012" /&gt; If the vaginal cuff is compromised, vaginal evisceration can occur with the [[small intestine]] protruding out through the vagina.&lt;ref name="Cronin_2012" /&gt;

A '''women's health nurse practitioner''' ('''WHNP''') is a [[nurse practitioner]] that specializes in continuing and comprehensive healthcare for women across the lifespan with emphasis on conditions unique to women from [[menarche]] through the remainder of their life cycle. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nurse Practitioner Primary Care Competencies in Specialty Areas|url=http://www.aacn.nche.edu/education-resources/npcompetencies.pdf|publisher=US Department of Health and Human Services|accessdate=12 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and board certification==
Following educational preparation at the [[Master of Science in Nursing|master's]] or [[Doctor of Nursing Practice|doctoral]] level, WHNPs must become [[Nursing board certification|board certified]] by an approved certification body.  Board certification must be maintained by obtaining [[continuing nursing education]] credits.  In the US, board certification is provided through the [[National Certification Corporation]] (awards the [[WHNP-BC]] credential).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Certification exams|url=http://www.nccwebsite.org/Certification|publisher=NCC|accessdate=12 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope of practice==
WHNPs deliver a range of acute, chronic, and [[preventive healthcare]] services:
* Obtaining a relevant health history, including a comprehensive [[Obstetrics|obstetric]] and [[gynecologic]] history, with emphasis on gender-based differences.
* Performing a complete, system, or symptom-directed physical examinations on women, including obstetric and gynecologic conditions/needs that include, [[Human pregnancy|pregnancy]], benign and malignant gynecologic conditions, [[contraception]], [[sexually transmitted infections]], [[infertility]], [[perimenopause]]/[[menopause]]/[[postmenopause]] and other gender-specific illnesses.
* Assessing, diagnosing, and treating for maternal and fetal well-being, [[High risk pregnancy|high-risk pregnancies]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], and pregnancy/postpartum complications.
* Assessing, diagnosing, and treating disease risk factors specific to women.
* Distinguishing female gender differences in presentation and progression of health problems and responses to pharmacological agents and other therapies.
* Assessing social and physical environmental health risks, including [[teratogens]], that impact [[childbearing]].
* Assessing for evidence of [[intimate partner violence]], [[sexual abuse]], and [[substance abuse]].
* Assessing, diagnosing, and treating issues related to [[human sexuality|sexuality]].
* Assessing parental behavior and skills and promotes smooth transition to role changes.
* Assessing, diagnosing, and treating selected [[reproductive health]] needs or problems in male partners, such as sexually transmitted infections, contraception, and infertility.
* Assessing [[Genetics|genetic risks]] and refers, as needed, for [[Genetic testing|testing]] and counseling.
* Collaborating with other health care providers for management or referral of high-risk pregnancies.
* Performing primary care procedures, including [[pap smears]], microscopy, [[post-coital test|post-coital tests]], [[intrauterine device]] (IUD) insertion, and [[Endometrial biopsy|endometrial biopsies]].
* Providing management and education for women and men in need of [[family planning]] and [[fertility control]].
