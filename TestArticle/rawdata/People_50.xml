In [[Greek mythology]], the '''Amazons''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Ἀμαζόνες}}, ''{{transl|grc|Amazónes}}'', singular {{lang|grc|Ἀμαζών}}, ''{{transl|grc|Amazōn}}'') were a tribe of women warriors related to [[Scythians]] and [[Sarmatians]]. [[Apollonius Rhodius]], at [[Argonautica]], mentions that Amazons were the daughters of [[Ares]] and [[Harmonia (mythology)|Harmonia]] (a nymph of the Akmonian Wood). They were brutal and aggressive, and their main concern in life was war.&lt;ref name="theoi.com"&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/AresFamily.html Apollonius Rhodius, Argonautica, Book 2]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ARGONAUTICA BOOK 2"&gt;[http://sacred-texts.com/cla/argo/argo23.htm ARGONAUTICA BOOK 2]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herodotus]] and [[Strabo]] place them on the banks of the [[Thermodon]],&lt;ref name="Herodotus Book 4: Melpomene"&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/hh/hh4110.htm Herodotus Book 4: Melpomene]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/wmn/rca/rca02.htm THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND]&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Diodorus]] giving the account of Dionysius of Mitylene, who, on his part, drew on Thymoetas, states that before the Amazons of the Thermodon there were, much earlier in time, the Amazons of Libya.&lt;ref name="penelope.uchicago.edu"&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/3D*.html The Library of History of Diodorus Siculus, Book III, 52]&lt;/ref&gt; These Amazons started from [[Ancient Libya|Libya]], passed through Egypt and Syria, and stopped at the [[Caïcus]] in [[Aeolis]], near which they founded several cities. Later, he says, they established [[Mytilene]] a little way beyond the Caïcus.&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt; [[Aeschylus]], in [[Prometheus Bound]], places the original home of the Amazons in the country about [[Lake Maeotis]] and they later moved to [[Themiscyra (Pontus)|Themiscyra]] on the Thermodon.&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AESCHYLUS, PROMETHEUS BOUND"&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Text/AeschylusPrometheus.html AESCHYLUS, PROMETHEUS BOUND]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Homer]] tells that the Amazons were sought and found somewhere near [[Lycia]].&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt;

Notable queens of the Amazons are [[Penthesilea]], who participated in the [[Trojan War]], and her sister [[Hippolyta]], whose magical girdle, given to her by her father [[Ares]], was the object of one of the [[labours of Heracles]]. [[Diodorus]] mentions that the Amazons traveled from Libya under Queen [[Myrina (mythology)|Myrina]].&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt; Amazon warriors were often depicted in battle with Greek warriors in [[amazonomachy|amazonomachies]] in classical art.

Archaeological discoveries of burial sites with female warriors on the Eurasian steppes suggest that the [[Scythian]] women may have inspired the myth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Simon|first1=Worrall|title=Amazon Warriors Did Indeed Fight and Die Like Men|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/10/141029-amazons-scythians-hunger-games-herodotus-ice-princess-tattoo-cannabis/|publisher=National Geographic|accessdate=13 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Foreman|first1=Amanda|title=The Amazon Women: Is There Any Truth Behind the Myth?|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/amazon-women-there-any-truth-behind-myth-180950188/|website=Smithsonian.com|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the [[early modern period]], their name has become a term for female warriors in general. Amazons were said to have founded the cities and temples of Smyrna, Sinope, Cyme, Gryne, Ephesus, Pitania, Magnesia, Clete, Pygela, Latoreria and Amastris; according to legend, the Amazons also invented the [[cavalry]].&lt;ref name="Wonder Woman"&gt;{{Cite book| last1=Steinem | first1=Gloria| last2=Chesler| first2=Phyllis | last3=Feitler | first3=Bea | title= Wonder Woman | publisher= Hole, Rinehart and Winston and Warner Books | date=1972 | isbn = 0-03-005376-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Palaephatus]], who was trying to rationalize the Greek myths in his work ''On Unbelievable Tales'' or ''On Incredible Tales'' ({{lang-grc|Περὶ ἀπίστων ἱστοριῶν}}), stated that the Amazons most probably were men mistaken for women by their enemies because they wore clothing which reached their feet, tied up their hair in headbands and shaved their beards, and also, since they did not exist during his time, most probably they did nοt exist in the past either.&lt;ref&gt;Palaephatus On Unbelievable Tales&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=t4EfiGQwgh4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=el#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false On Unbelievable Tales, p. 64]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=a-NmaO-kM2UC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=el#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Classical Mythology: A Guide to the Mythical World of the Greeks and Romans, p. 9]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The origin of the word is uncertain. It may be derived from an [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] [[ethnonym]] ''*ha-mazan-'' "warriors", a word attested indirectly through a derivation, a denominal verb in [[Hesychius of Alexandria]]'s gloss {{lang|grc|"ἁμαζακάραν· πολεμεῖν. Πέρσαι"}} ("''{{transl|grc|hamazakaran}}'': 'to make war' in Persian"), where it appears together with the [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]] root ''*kar-'' "make" (from which [[Sanskrit]] ''[[karma]]'' is also derived).&lt;ref&gt;Lagercrantz, ''Xenia Lidéniana'' (1912), 270ff., cited after [[Hjalmar Frisk]], ''Greek Etymological Dictionary'' (1960–1970)&lt;/ref&gt;

It may also be derived from ''{{PIE|*ṇ-mṇ-gw-jon-es}}'' "manless, without husbands" ([[privative a|''a-'' privative]] and a derivation of ''[[Man (word)|*man-]]'' also found in Slavic ''muzh'') has been proposed, an explanation deemed "unlikely" by [[Hjalmar Frisk]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacobsohn, [[Kuhns Zeitschrift|KZ]] 54, 278ff., cited after [[Hjalmar Frisk]] (1960–1970).&lt;/ref&gt; 19th-century scholarship also connected the term to the ethnonym [[Amazigh]].&lt;ref&gt;Guy Cadogan Rothery, ''The Amazons'' (1910), [http://www.sacred-texts.com/wmn/ama/ama08.htm ch. 7]: "There have been some authors who trace the word Amazon from this term."&lt;/ref&gt; A further explanation proposes Iranian *''ama-janah'' "virility-killing" as source.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hinge|2005|pp=94–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=The Hittite researcher Friedrich Cornelius assumes that there had been the land Azzi with the capital Chajasa in the area of the Thermodon-Iris Delta on the coast of the Black Sea. He brings its residents in direct relation to the Amazons, namely based on its name (woman of the land Azzi = 'Am'+ 'Azzi' = Amazon) and its customs (matriarchal custom of promiscuous sexual intercourse, even with blood relatives).

Among Classical Greeks, ''amazon'' was given a [[False etymology|folk etymology]] as originating from ''{{transl|grc|a-}}'' ({{lang|grc|ἀ-}}) and ''{{transl|grc|mazos}}'' ({{lang|grc|μαζός}}), "without [[breast]]", connected with an [[etiology|etiological]] tradition once claimed by [[Justin (historian)|Marcus Justinus]] who alleged that Amazons had their right [[mastectomy|breast cut off]] or [[breast ironing|burnt out]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Justin (historian)|Justinus']] "Historiae Phillippicae ex Trogo Pompeio", Liber II, 4: "Virgines (...) armis, equis, venationibus exercebant, inustis infantum dexterioribus mammis, ne sagittarum iactus impediantur; unde dictae Amazones." "They exercised the virgins on weapon-wielding, horse-riding and hunting, and burned the children's right breasts, so that arrow-throwing wouldn't be impeded; and for such reason, they were called Amazons."&lt;/ref&gt; There is no indication of such a practice in ancient works of art,&lt;ref name=Mayor&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/the-amazons-lives--legends-of-warrior-women-across-the-ancient-world-by-adrienne-mayor-book-review-9799090.html|title=The Amazons: Lives &amp; Legends of Warrior Women Across the Ancient World by Adrienne Mayor, book review|last=Haynes|first=Natalie|date=16 October 2014|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the Amazons are always represented with both breasts, although one is frequently covered.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Amazons|volume=1|pages=790–791}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mayor"/&gt; Adrienne Mayor suggests the origin of this myth was due to the word's etymology.&lt;ref name=Mayor/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Adrienne Mayor, Start the Week, Radio Four|date= 6 April 2015|time= 21:30 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b05plghp|publisher=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greeks also used some [[epithet|descriptive phrases]] for them. Herodotus used the ''Androktones'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀνδροκτόνες}}, singular {{lang|grc|Ἀνδροκτόνα}}, ''{{transl|grc|Androktona}}'') ("killers of men")&lt;ref name="Herodotus Book 4: Melpomene"/&gt; and ''Androleteirai'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀνδρολέτειραι}}, singular {{lang|grc|Ἀνδρολέτειρα}}, ''{{transl|grc|Androleteira}}'') ("destroyers of men, murderesses"),&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt; in the [[Iliad]] they are also called ''Antianeirai'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀντιάνειραι}}, singular {{lang|grc|Ἀντιάνειρα}}, ''{{transl|grc|Antianeira}}'') ("against men") and Aeschylus, in his work ''Prometheus Bound'', used ''styganor'' ({{lang|grc|στυγάνωρ}}) ("those who loathe all men").&lt;ref name="AESCHYLUS, PROMETHEUS BOUND"/&gt;&lt;ref name="perseus.tufts.edu"&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0009%3Acard%3D696 Aeschylus, Prometheus Bound]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
[[File:Amazon Anıtı (2).jpg|thumb|upleft|Amazons monument in [[Samsun]], [[Turkey]].]]

[[Herodotus]] and [[Strabo]] placed them on the banks of the [[Thermodon]] and [[Themiscyra (Pontus)|Themiscyra]].&lt;ref name="Herodotus Book 4: Melpomene"/&gt;&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt; Herodotus also mentions that some Amazons lived at Scythia because after the Greeks defeated the Amazons in battle, they sailed away carrying in three ships as many Amazons as they had been able to take alive, but out at sea the Amazons attacked the crews and killed them, then these Amazons landed at Scythian lands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126%3Abook%3D4%3Achapter%3D110%3Asection%3D1 Herodotus Histories]&lt;/ref&gt; Strabo writes that the original home of the Amazons was in Themiscyra and the plains about Thermodon and the mountains that lie above them, but were later driven out of these places, and during his time they were said to live in the mountains above [[Caucasian Albania]] (not to be confused with the modern [[Albania]]), but he also states that some others, among them [[Metrodorus of Scepsis]] and [[Hypsicrates]], say that after Themiscyra, the Amazons traveled and lived on the borders of the Gargarians, in the northerly foothills of those parts of the [[Caucasian Mountains]] which are called Ceraunian.&lt;ref name="uchicago1"&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/11E*.html STRABO, GEOGRAPHY, Book XI, Chapter 5] {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diodorus]] giving the account of Dionysius of Mitylene, who, on his part, drew on Thymoetas states that before the Amazons of the Thermodon there were, much earlier in time, the Amazons of Libya.&lt;ref name="penelope.uchicago.edu"/&gt; These Amazons started from [[Ancient Libya|Libya]] passed through Egypt and Syria, and stopped at the [[Caïcus]] in [[Aeolis]], near which they founded several cities. Later, he says, they established [[Mitylene]] a little way beyond the Caïcus.&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt; [[Aeschylus]], in ''[[Prometheus Bound]]'', places the original home of the Amazons in the country about [[Lake Maeotis]] and they later moved to [[Themiscyra (Pontus)|Themiscyra]] on the Thermodon.&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AESCHYLUS, PROMETHEUS BOUND"/&gt; According to [[Pseudo-Plutarch]], the Amazons lived in and about the Tanais ({{lang-grc-gre|Τάναϊς}}) river (modern [[Don River (Russia)|Don river]]), formerly called the Amazonian or Amazon ({{lang-grc-gre|Ἀμαζόνιος}}) river, because the Amazons bathed themselves therein.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0400%3Achapter%3D14 Pseudo-Plutarch-XIV, TANAIS]&lt;/ref&gt; The Amazons later moved to [[Themiscyra (mythology)|Themiscyra]] (speculated to be modern [[Terme]], though no ruins exist) on the River [[Thermodon]] (the Terme river in northern Turkey).
[[Plutarch]] mentions that the campaign(s) of [[Heracles]] and [[Theseus]] against the Amazons was at [[Euxine Sea]] (modern Black Sea).&lt;ref name="uchicago2"&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/plutarch/lives/theseus*.html Plutarch, The Parallel Lives, The Life of Theseus]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Homer]] tells that the Amazons were sought and found somewhere near [[Lycia]].&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt;

[[File:Amazon trousers BM VaseB673.jpg|thumb|upright|Amazon wearing trousers and carrying a shield with an attached patterned cloth and a quiver. [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] Attic white-ground [[alabastron]], {{circa|470 BC}}, [[British Museum]], London.]]
The Amazons were supposed to have founded many towns, amongst them [[Smyrna]], [[Ephesus]], [[Cyme (Aeolis)|Cyme]], [[Myrina (Aeolis)|Myrina]], [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinope]], [[Paphos]], [[Mitylene]].&lt;ref name="uchicago1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt; At [[Patmos]] there was a place called Amazonium.&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stadiasm. Mar. Mag. p. 488, ed. Hoffmann&lt;/ref&gt; Also, on the island of [[Lemnos]], there was another Myrina.&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt; The cities of Myrina had this name after the amazon [[Myrina (mythology)|Myrina]].

[[Apollonius Rhodius]], at [[Argonautica]], mentions that at Thermodon the Amazons were not gathered together in one city, but scattered over the land, parted into three tribes. In one part dwelt the Themiscyreians ({{lang|grc|Θεμισκύρειαι}}), in another the Lycastians ({{lang|grc|Λυκάστιαι}}), and in another the Chadesians ({{lang|grc|Χαδήσιαι}}).&lt;ref name="ARGONAUTICA BOOK 2, 994-1001"&gt;[http://sacred-texts.com/cla/argo/argo23.htm ARGONAUTICA BOOK 2, 994-1001]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other names==

Greeks also used other [[epithet|descriptive phrases]] for them. Herodotus used the ''Androktones'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀνδροκτόνες}}, singular {{lang|grc|Ἀνδροκτόνα}}, ''{{transl|grc|Androktonα}}'') ("killers/slayers of men")&lt;ref name="Herodotus Book 4: Melpomene"/&gt; and ''Androleteirai'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀνδρολέτειραι}}, singular {{lang|grc|Ἀνδρολέτειρα}}, ''{{transl|grc|Androleteira}}'') ("destroyers of men, murderesses"),&lt;ref name="THE AMAZONS IN GREEK LEGEND"/&gt; in the [[Iliad]] they are also called ''Antianeirai'' ({{lang|grc|Ἀντιάνειραι}}, singular {{lang|grc|Ἀντιάνειρα}}, ''{{transl|grc|Antianeira}}'') ("equivalent to men") and Aeschylus used the ''Styganor'' ({{lang|grc|Στυγάνωρ}}) ("those who loathe all men")&lt;ref name="AESCHYLUS, PROMETHEUS BOUND"/&gt;&lt;ref name="perseus.tufts.edu"/&gt; in his work [[Prometheus Bound]].

[[Herodotus]] stated that in the Scythian language they were called ''Oiorpata'', ''oior'' meaning "man", and ''pata'' meaning "to slay".&lt;ref name="Herodotus Book 4: Melpomene"/&gt;

==Mythology==
In some versions of the myth, no men were permitted to have sexual encounters or reside in Amazon country; but once a year, in order to prevent their race from dying out, they visited the [[Gargareans]], a neighbouring tribe.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

[[Strabo]], giving credits to [[Metrodorus of Scepsis]] and [[Hypsicrates]], mentions that at his time the Amazons were believed to live on the borders of the [[Gargareans]]. There were two special months in the spring in which they would go up into the neighboring mountain which separates them and the Gargareans. The Gargareans also, in accordance with an ancient custom, would go there to offer sacrifice with the Amazons and also to have intercourse with them for the sake of begetting children. They did this in secrecy and darkness, any Gargareans at random with any Amazon, and after making them pregnant they would send them away. Any females that were born are retained by the Amazons themselves, but the males would be taken to the Gargareans to be brought up; and each Gargarean to whom a child is brought would adopt the child as his own, regarding the child as his son because of his uncertainty.&lt;ref name="uchicago1"/&gt; He also stated that the Gargareans went up from Themiscyra into this region with the Amazons, then, in company with some Thracians and Euboeans who had wandered thus far, waged war against them. They later ended the war against the Amazons and made a compact that they should have dealings with one another only in the matter of children, and that each people should live independent of the other.&lt;ref name="uchicago1"/&gt;
In addition, he states that the right breasts of all Amazons are seared when they are infants, so that they can easily use their right arm for every needed purpose, and especially that of throwing the javelin and use the bow.&lt;ref name="uchicago1"/&gt;
[[File:Otto van Veen - Amazons and Scythians.jpg|thumb|left|320px|''Amazons and Scythians'' by [[Otto van Veen]]]]

Herodotus mentions that when Greeks defeated the Amazons at war, they sailed away carrying in three ships as many Amazons as they had been able to take alive, but out at sea the Amazons attacked the crews and killed them. But the Amazons knew nothing about ships so they were driven about by waves and winds and they were disembarked at the land of the Scythians, there they met first with a troop of horses feeding, they seized them and mounted upon these they plundered the property of the Scythians. The Scythians were not able to understand them because they did not know either their speech or their dress or the race to which they belonged, and they thought that they were men. Scythians fought a battle against them, and after the battle the Scythians got possession of the bodies of the dead, and thus they discovered that they were women. After the battle Scythians sent young men and told them to encamp near the Amazons and to do whatsoever they should do. If the women should come after them, they were not to fight but to retire before them, and when the women stopped, they were to approach near and encamp. This plan was adopted by the Scythians because they desired to have children born from them. When the Amazons perceived that they had not come to do them any harm, they let them alone; and the two camps approached nearer to one another every day: and the young men, like the Amazons, had nothing except their arms and their horses and got their living, as the Amazons did, by hunting and by taking booty. One day a Scythian and an Amazon came close. They could not speak to each other because they were speaking different languages but the Amazon made signs to him with her hand to come. Later the young Scythians and the Amazons joined their camps and lived together, each man having for his wife her with whom he had had dealings at first. The men were not able to learn the language of the Amazons, but the women learned Scythian.&lt;ref name="Herodotus Book 4: Melpomene"/&gt;

[[Apollonius Rhodius]], at [[Argonautica]], mentions that Amazons were the daughters of [[Ares]] and [[Harmonia (mythology)|Harmonia]] (a nymph of the Akmonian Wood). They were brutal and aggressive, and their main concern in life was war.&lt;ref name="theoi.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ARGONAUTICA BOOK 2"/&gt; According to him, the Amazons were not gathered together in one city, but scattered over the land, parted into three tribes. In one part dwelt the Themiscyreians ({{lang|grc|Θεμισκύρειαι}}), in another the Lycastians ({{lang|grc|Λυκάστιαι}}), and in another the Chadesians ({{lang|grc|Χαδήσιαι}}).&lt;ref name="ARGONAUTICA BOOK 2, 994-1001"/&gt; Also, he mention that on an island, the Queens of the Amazons, Otrere ({{lang|grc|Ὀτρηρή}}) and Antiope ({{lang|grc|Ἀντιόπη}}), built a marble temple of Ares. On this desert island there were ravening birds, which in countless numbers haunt it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sacred-texts.com/cla/argo/argo17.htm ARGONAUTICA BOOK 2, 380-390]&lt;/ref&gt; The island mentioned is the [[Aretias]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D6%3Achapter%3D13 Pliny the Elder, The Natural History-Book VI-Chapter 13.5]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Argonauts]] passed by Themiscyra on their journey to [[Colchis]].

The King [[Iobates]] sent [[Bellerophon]] against Amazons, hoping that they would kill him, but Bellerophon killed them all.&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' vi. 186, &amp;c.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Scholiast]] ''On [[Lycophron]]'' 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0162%3Abook%3DO.%3Apoem%3D13 Pindar, Olympian 13:89]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Amazons appear in [[Greek art]] of the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic period]] and in connection with several Greek legends. The tomb of [[Myrine]] is mentioned in the ''Iliad''; later interpretation made of her an Amazon: according to [[Diodorus Siculus|Diodorus]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' Book ii.45-46; book iii.52-55&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Diodorus, the Amazons under the rule of Queen Myrina, invaded the lands of the [[Atlantis|Atlantians]]. Amazons defeated the army of the Atlantian city of Cerne, treated the captives savagely, killed all the men, led into slavery the children and women, and razed the city. When the terrible fate of the inhabitants of Cerne became known among the other Atlantians, they were struck with terror, surrendered their cities on terms of capitulation and announced that they would do whatever should be commanded them. Queen Myrina bearing herself honourably towards the Atlantians, established friendship with them and founded a city to bear her name in place of the city of Cerne which had been razed; and in it she settled both the captives and any native who so desired. Atlantians presented her with magnificent presents and by public decree voted to her notable honours, and she in return accepted their courtesy and in addition promised that she would show kindness to their nation. Diodorus also mentions that the Amazons of Queen Myrina used the skins of gigantic snakes, from Libya, to protect themselves at battle. Later Queen Myrine led her Amazons to victory against the [[Gorgons]]. After the battle against the Gorgons, Myrina accorded a funeral to her fallen comrades on three pyres and raised up three great heaps of earth as tombs, which are called "Amazon Mounds" ({{lang-grc-gre|Ἀμαζόνων σωρούς}}).&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/3D*.html The Library of History of Diodorus Siculus, Book III, 54]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the [[Labours of Hercules|tasks imposed upon Hercules]] by [[Eurystheus]] was to obtain possession of the [[girdle]] of the Amazonian queen [[Hippolyta]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pseudo-Apollodorus]], ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' ii. 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]], ''[[Bibliotheca historica]]'' iv. 16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Gaius Julius Hyginus]], ''Fabulae'' 30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Quintus Smyrnaeus]] xi. 244&lt;/ref&gt; He was accompanied by his friend [[Theseus]], who carried off the princess [[Antiope (Amazon)|Antiope]], sister of Hippolyta, an incident which led to a retaliatory invasion of [[Attica]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'' i. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Theseus'' 26-28&lt;/ref&gt; in which Antiope perished fighting by the side of Theseus.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; In some versions, however, Theseus marries Hippolyta and in others, he marries Antiope and she does not die; by this marriage with the Amazon Theseus had a son [[Hippolytus (son of Theseus)|Hippolytus]]. 
In another version of this myth, Theseus made this voyage on his own account, after the time of Heracles.&lt;ref name="uchicago2"/&gt;
The battle between the Athenians and Amazons is often commemorated in an entire genre of art, [[amazonomachy]], in marble [[bas-relief]]s such as from the [[Parthenon]] or the sculptures of the [[Mausoleum of Halicarnassus]].
[[File:Johann Georg Platzer - Thalestris im Lager Alexander des Großen.jpg|left|thumb|300px|''[[Thalestris]], Queen of the Amazons, visits [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]'' by [[Johann Georg Platzer]]]]

[[Plutarch]], in his work [[Parallel Lives]]-The Life of Theseus, mentions that Bion said that the Amazons, were naturally friendly to men, and did not fly from Theseus when he touched upon their coasts.&lt;ref name="uchicago2"/&gt;

Amazons attacked the [[Phrygia]]ns, who were assisted by [[Priam]], then a young man.&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' iii. 189&lt;/ref&gt; In his later years, however, towards the end of the [[Trojan War]], his old opponents took his side against the Greeks under their queen [[Penthesilea]] "of [[Thrace|Thracian]] birth", who was slain by [[Achilles]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In the ''[[Aethiopis]]'', a continuation of the ''Iliad''. The epic, by [[Arctinus of Miletus]], is lost: only references to it survive.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Quintus Smyrnaeus]] i. 699&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Justin (historian)|Justin]] ii.4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Virgil]], ''[[Aeneid]]'' i. 490&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'' v. 11. § 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Philostratus]] ''Her.'' xix. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

The god [[Dionysus]] and his entourage fought the amazons at [[Ephesus]], the Amazons fled to [[Samos]], but Dionysus pursued them and at Samos he killed a great number of them on a spot which was, from that occurrence, called Panaema ({{lang|grc|Πάναιμα}}), which means blood-soaked field.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rboWBAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=el#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Amazons: Lives and Legends of Warrior Women across the Ancient World]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0216%3Asection%3D56 Plutarch, Quaestiones Graecae, Question 56]&lt;/ref&gt; In another myth Dionysus united with the Amazons to fight against [[Cronus]] and the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/3E*.html DIODORUS SICULUS LIBRARY OF HISTORY, Book III, 74]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Amazons are also said to have undertaken an expedition against the [[Snake Island (Black Sea)|island of Leuke]], at the mouth of the [[Danube]], where the ashes of Achilles had been deposited by [[Thetis]]. The ghost of the dead hero appeared and so terrified the horses, that they threw and trampled upon the invaders, who were forced to retire. [[Pompey]] is said to have found them in the army of [[Mithridates VI of Pontus|Mithridates]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

They are heard of in the time of Alexander, when some of the king's biographers make mention of Amazon Queen [[Thalestris]] visiting him and becoming a mother by him (the story is known from the ''[[Alexander Romance]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Greek [[Alexander Romance]], [http://www.attalus.org/translate/alexander3c.html#25 3.25-26]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, several other biographers of Alexander dispute the claim, including the highly regarded [[secondary source]], [[Plutarch]]. In his writing he makes mention of a moment when Alexander's secondary naval commander, [[Onesicritus]], was reading the Amazon passage of his Alexander history to King [[Lysimachus]] of [[Thrace]] who was on the original expedition: the king smiled at him and said "And where was I, then?"&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Life of Alexander'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Alexander*/6-7.html#46 Chapter 46]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman writer [[Virgil]]'s characterization of the [[Volsci]]an warrior maiden [[Camilla (mythology)|Camilla]] in the ''[[Aeneid]]'' borrows heavily from the myth of the Amazons.

[[Jordanes]]' ''[[Getica]]'' ({{circa|560}}), purporting to give the earliest history of the [[Goths]], relates that the Goths' ancestors, descendants of [[Magog (Bible)|Magog]], originally dwelt within Scythia, on the [[Sea of Azov]] between the [[Dnieper]] and [[Don River (Russia)|Don Rivers]]. After a few centuries, following an incident where the Goths' women successfully fended off a raid by a neighboring tribe, while the menfolk were off campaigning against Pharaoh [[Vesosis]], the women formed their own army under [[Marpesia]] and crossed the Don, invading Asia. Her sister [[Lampedo]] remained in Europe to guard the homeland. They procreated with men once a year. These Amazons conquered Armenia, Syria, and all of Asia Minor, even reaching [[Ionia]] and [[Aeolis|Aeolia]], holding this vast territory for 100 years. Jordanes also mentions that they fought with Hercules, and in the Trojan War, and that a smaller contingent of them endured in the Caucasus Mountains until the time of Alexander. He mentions by name the Queens Menalippe, Hippolyta, and Penthesilea.

In the Grottaferrata Version of ''[[Digenes Akritas]]'', the twelfth century medieval epic of Basil, the Greek-Syrian knight of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] frontier, the hero battles with and kills the female warrior Maximo.

* She was descended from some Amazons.
* Taken by Alexander from the Brahmans.&lt;ref&gt;''Digenis Akritas: the Two-Blood Border Lord'', translated by Denison B. Hull, 1972, Ohio University Press, G-vi, 385-387, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several (conflicting) lists of names of Amazons.
* [[Quintus Smyrnaeus]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Quintus Smyrnaeus]], ''[[Posthomerica]]'' I&lt;/ref&gt; lists the attendant warriors of Penthesilea: "Clonie was there, Polemusa, Derinoe, Evandre, and [[Antandre]], and [[Bremusa]], [[Hippothoe]], dark-eyed Harmothoe, [[Alcibie]], Derimacheia, Antibrote, and Thermodosa glorying with the spear."
* [[Diodorus Siculus]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]], ''[[Bibliotheca historica]]'' IV. 16&lt;/ref&gt; lists twelve Amazons who challenged Heracles to single combat during his quest for Hippolyta's girdle and died against him one by one: [[Aella (Amazon)|Aella]], Philippis, Prothoe, Eriboea, [[Celaeno]], Eurybia, [[Phoebe (mythological characters)|Phoebe]], Deianeira, [[Asteria (mythology)|Asteria]], Marpe, Tecmessa, Alcippe. After Alcippe's death, a group attack followed. Diodorus also mentions [[Myrina (mythology)|Myrina]] as a queen of the Amazons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/3D*.html The Library of History of Diodorus Siculus, Book III]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Another list of Amazons' names is found in [[Hyginus]]' ''Fabulae''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gaius Julius Hyginus]], ''Fabulae'' 163&lt;/ref&gt; Along with [[Hippolyta]], [[Otrera]], [[Antiope (Amazon)|Antiope]] and [[Penthesilea]], it attests the following names: Ocyale, Dioxippe, Iphinome, Xanthe, [[Hippothoe]], Laomache, [[Glauce]], [[Agave (mythology)|Agave]], Theseis, Clymene, Polydora.
* Yet another different set of names is found in [[Gaius Valerius Flaccus|Valerius Flaccus]]' ''Argonautica'':&lt;ref&gt;[[Gaius Valerius Flaccus|Valerius Flaccus]], ''[http://www.theoi.com/Text/ValeriusFlaccus1.html Argonautica]'', 6. 370-377&lt;/ref&gt; he mentions Euryale, Harpe, Lyce, Menippe and Thoe. Of these Lyce also appears in a fragment preserved in the ''[[Latin Anthology]]'' where she is said to have killed the hero Clonus of [[Moesia]], son of Doryclus, with her javelin.&lt;ref name="Latin Anthology" /&gt;
* [[John Tzetzes]] in ''Posthomerica''&lt;ref&gt;[[Tzetzes]], ''Posthomerica'', 176-183&lt;/ref&gt; enumerates the Amazons who fell at [[Troy]]: Hippothoe, Antianeira, Toxophone, Toxoanassa, Gortyessa, Iodoce, Pharetre, Andro, Ioxeia, Oïstrophe, Androdaïxa, Aspidocharme, Enchesimargos, Cnemis, Thorece, Chalcaor, Eurylophe, Hecate, Anchimache, Andromache the queen. Concerning Antianeira and Andromache, see below; for almost all the other names on the list, this is a unique attestation.
* [[Stephanus of Byzantium]] provides an alternate list of the Amazons who fell against Heracles, describing them as "the most prominent" of their people: Tralla, Isocrateia, Thiba, Palla, Coea (Koia), Coenia (Koinia).&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephanus of Byzantium]], s. v. ''Thibaïs''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eustathius of Thessalonica|Eustathius]] gives the same list minus the last two names.&lt;ref&gt;Eustathius on [[Dionysius Periegetes]], 828&lt;/ref&gt; Both Stephanus and Eustathius write of these Amazons in connection with the placename Thibais, which they report to have been derived from Thiba's name.

Other names of Amazons from various sources include:

* [[Aegea]], queen of the Amazons who was thought by some to have been the [[eponym]] of the [[Aegean Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Sextus Pompeius Festus]], s. v. ''Aegeum Mare''&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ainia, presumably accompanied [[Penthesilea]] to the [[Trojan War]], killed by [[Achilles]]; known only from an Attic terracotta relief fragment.&lt;ref&gt;New York, Metropolitan Museum of Art 42.11.33, c. 600. ''LIMC'', "Achilleus" no. 720*.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ainippe, an Amazon who confronted [[Telamon]] in the battle against Heracles' troops.&lt;ref name="Perseus Digital Library - Description of the Tyrrhenian amphora" /&gt;

* Amastris, who was believed to be the [[eponym]] of the city previously known as Kromna,&lt;ref&gt;[[Demosthenes]] in [[Stephanus of Byzantium]] s. v. Amastris&lt;/ref&gt; although the city was actually named after the historical [[Amastrine|Amastris]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]], ''Geography'', 12. 3. 11&lt;/ref&gt;
* Anaea, an Amazon whose tomb was shown at the island of [[Samos]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephanus of Byzantium]] s. v. Anaia&lt;/ref&gt;

''Kynna''. Stephanus does not write out the Amazon's name, simply stating that the town Cynna could have been named "after one of the Amazons".&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ephesos, a [[Lydia]]n Amazon, after whom the city of [[Ephesus]] was thought to have been named; she was also said to have been the first to honor [[Artemis]] and to have surnamed the goddess ''Ephesia''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Etymologicum Magnum]]'' 402. 8, under ''Ephesos''&lt;/ref&gt; Her daughter Amazo was thought of as the eponym of the Amazons.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephanus of Byzantium]], s. v.

===Hero cults===
According to ancient sources ([[Plutarch]], [[Theseus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:BiDerPMT15YJ:classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/theseus.html+Amazon+statues+in+Scotussa&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=4 |title=The Internet Classics Archive &amp;#124; Theseus by Plutarch |publisher=Google.com |date=2010-09-02 |accessdate=2010-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]), Amazon tombs could be found frequently throughout what was once known as the ancient Greek world. Some are found in [[Megara]], [[Athens]], [[Chaeronea]], [[Chalcis]], [[Thessaly]] at [[Skotousa]], in [[Cynoscephalae (Thessaly)|Cynoscephalae]], and statues of Amazons are all over Greece. [[Stephanus of Byzantium]], quoting [[Ephorus]], mention that the tomb of the amazon Anaea ({{lang|grc|Ἀναία}}) was at the city of [[Söke|Anaea]] ({{lang|grc|Ἄναια}}), which also has this name after the amazon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Mary Bennett| first = Florence | title = Religious Cults Associated With the Amazons| url = http://www.sacred-texts.com/wmn/rca/rca02.htm| publisher = Forgotten Books |date= December 2007 | isbn = 978-1605063867}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At both Chalcis and Athens, [[Plutarch]] tells us that there was an Amazoneum or shrine of Amazons that implied the presence of both tombs and cult. At the entrance of Athens there was a monument to the Amazon [[Antiope (Amazon)|Antiope]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0160%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D2 Pausanias, Description of Greece]&lt;/ref&gt; On the day before the Thesea at Athens there were annual sacrifices to the Amazons. In historical times Greek maidens of [[Ephesus]] performed an annual circular dance with weapons and shields that had been established by [[Hippolyta]] and her Amazons. They had initially set up wooden statues of [[Artemis]], a ''bretas'' ([[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ({{floruit|{{circa|AD 160}}}}): ''Description of Greece'', Book I: Attica).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/pausanias-bk1.html |title=Ancient History Sourcebook: Pausanias: Description of Greece, Book I: Attica |publisher=Fordham.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In art===
[[File:Gladiatrix relief.jpg|thumb|left|Two [[female gladiator]]s with their names ''Amazonia and Achillea''.]]

In works of art, battles between Amazons and Greeks are placed on the same level as – and often associated with – battles of Greeks and [[centaur]]s. The belief in their existence, however, having been once accepted and introduced into the national poetry and art, it became necessary to surround them as far as possible with the appearance of natural beings. Amazons were therefore depicted in the manner of Scythian or Sarmatian horsemen. Their occupation was hunting and war; their arms the bow, spear, axe, a half shield, nearly in the shape of a crescent, called ''pelta'', and in early art a helmet. The model in the Greek mind had apparently been the goddess [[Athena]]. In later art they approach the model of Artemis, wearing a thin dress, girt high for speed; while on the later painted vases their dress is often peculiarly [[Iran|Persian]] – that is, close-fitting trousers and a high cap called the ''kidaris''. They were usually on horseback but sometimes on foot.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;
This depiction of Amazons demonstrates just how closely, in the Greek mind, the Amazons were linked to the Scythians. Their manner of dress has been noted to bear a striking similarity to the traditional dress of nomadic peoples from the Crimea to Mongolia.&lt;ref name="amaz"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/secrets/previous_seasons/case_amazon/clues.html |title=SECRETS OF THE DEAD . Amazon Warrior Women. Clues and Evidence |publisher=PBS |date= |accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amazons were described by Herodotus as wearing trousers and having tall stiff caps.{{cn|date=March 2018}} The double-sided axe was the most emblematic of their weapons.&lt;ref name="Wonder Woman"/&gt; Amazons can also be identified in vase paintings by the fact that they are wearing one earring. The battle between Theseus and the Amazons ([[Amazonomachy]]) is a favourite subject on the friezes of temples (e.g. the reliefs from the frieze of the [[Temple of Apollo at Bassae]], now in the [[British Museum]]), vases and sarcophagus reliefs; at [[Athens]] it was represented on the shield of the statue of [[Athena Parthenos]], on wall-paintings in the [[Theseum]] and in the ''[[Stoa Poikile]]''.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; There were also three standard [[Amazon statue types]].

Later in the [[The Renaissance|Renaissance]], as Amazon myth evolved, artists started to depict warrior women in a new light. [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]] was often thought of as an Amazon-like warrior during her reign and was sometimes depicted as such.&lt;!-- really? Examples? --&gt; Though, as explained in ''Divinia Viagro'' by Winfried Schleiner, Celeste T. Wright "has given a detailed account of the bad press Amazons had in the Renaissance (with respect to their unwomanly conduct and Scythian cruelty). She notes that she has not found any Elizabethans comparing the queen directly to an Amazon, and suggests that they might have hesitated to do so because of the association of Amazons with enfranchisement of women, which was considered contemptible."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = "Divina Virago": Queen Elizabeth as an Amazon|jstor = 4173965|journal = Studies in Philology|date = 1978-04-01|pages = 163–180|volume = 75|issue = 2|first = Winfried|last = Schleiner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Paul Rubens]] and [[Jan Brueghel the Elder|Jan Brueghel]] depicted the Battle of the Amazons around 1598, showing many attributes of Renaissance-styled paintings. Amazons also appear in the [[Rococo]] period in another painting titled ''Battle of the Amazons'' by [[Johann Georg Platzer]]. As a part of the Romantic period revival, German artist [[Anselm Feuerbach]] painted the Amazons as well. His paintings “engendered all the aspirations of the Romantics: their desire to transcend the boundaries of the ego and of the known world; their interest in the occult in nature and in the soul; their search for a national identity, and the ensuing search for the mythic origins of the Germanic nation; finally, their wish to escape the harsh realities of the present through immersion in an idealized past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = German masters of the nineteenth century : paintings and drawings from the Federal Republic of Germany / The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York :: Metropolitan Museum of Art Publications|url = http://libmma.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15324coll10/id/71300|website = libmma.contentdm.oclc.org|accessdate = 2015-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;”

==In historiography==
[[File:S03 06 01 020 image 2552.jpg|thumbnail|Amazon in combat, infl. Polyclitus, Rome. Brooklyn Museum Archives, Goodyear Archival Collection]]
[[Herodotus]] reported that the Sarmatians were descendants of Amazons and Scythians, and that their wives observed their ancient maternal customs, "frequently hunting on horseback with their husbands; in war taking the field; and wearing the very same dress as the men". Moreover, said Herodotus, "No girl shall wed till she has killed a man in battle". In the story related by Herodotus, a group of Amazons was blown across the [[Sea of Azov|Maeotian Lake]] (the [[Sea of Azov]]) into [[Scythia]] near the cliff region (today's southeastern [[Crimean Peninsula|Crimea]]). After learning the Scythian language, they agreed to marry Scythian men, on the condition that they not be required to follow the customs of Scythian women. According to Herodotus, this band moved toward the northeast, settling beyond the [[Don River (Russia)|Tanais]] ([[Don River (Russia)|Don]]) river, and became the ancestors of the [[Sarmatians|Sauromatians]]. According to Herodotus, the [[Sarmatians]] fought with the Scythians against [[Darius the Great]] in the 5th century BC.

Hippocrates describes them as: "They have no right breasts...for while they are yet babies their mothers make red-hot a bronze instrument constructed for this very purpose and apply it to the right breast and cauterize it, so that its growth is arrested, and all its strength and bulk are diverted to the right shoulder and right arm."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://perseus.uchicago.edu/perseus-cgi/citequery3.pl?dbname=GreekFeb2011&amp;query=Hipp.%20Aer.%2017&amp;getid=2|title=Perseus Under Philologic: Hipp. Aer. 17|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amazons came to play a role in [[Roman historiography]]. Caesar reminded the Senate of the conquest of large parts of Asia by [[Semiramis]] and the Amazons. Successful Amazon raids against Lycia and Cilicia contrasted with effective resistance by Lydian cavalry against the invaders ([[Strabo]] 5.504; Nicholas Damascenus). [[Gnaeus Pompeius Trogus]] pays particularly detailed attention to the Amazons. The story of the Amazons as deriving from a Cappadocian colony of two Scythian princes Ylinos and Scolopetos is due to him. [[Pliny the Elder]] records some surprising facts pointing to the valley of the [[Terme River]] as possibly being their home: a mountain named for them (the modern Mason Dagi), as well as a settlement Amazonium; Herodotus (VI.86) first mentions their capital [[Themiscyra (Pontus)|Themiscyra]], which Pliny locates near the Terme.&lt;ref&gt;[[Natural History (Pliny)|Naturalis Historia]] VI.3.10&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philostratus]] places the Amazons in the [[Taurus Mountains]]. [[Ammianus Marcellinus|Ammianus]] places them east of [[Tanais]], as neighbouring the [[Alans]]. [[Procopius]] places them in the Caucasus. [[Diodorus Siculus]] (''[[Bibliotheca historica]]'' III, chapter 52) mentioned that besides [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]] Amazons existed much older race (at that time entirely disappeared) of Amazons from western [[Ancient Libya|Libya]], and retells their mythological story which includes [[Atlantis]] and Greek mythology.

Although Strabo shows skepticism as to their historicity, the Amazons in general continue to be taken as historical throughout Late Antiquity. Several Church Fathers speak of the Amazons as of a real people. [[Gaius Julius Solinus|Solinus]] embraces the account of Pliny. Under [[Aurelianus]], captured [[Goths|Gothic]] women were identified as Amazons ([[Claudian]]us). The account of [[Justin (historian)|Justinus]] was influential, and was used as a source by [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]] who continued to be read during the European Middle Ages. Medieval authors thus continue the tradition of locating the Amazons in the North, [[Adam of Bremen]] placing them at the [[Baltic Sea]] and [[Paulus Diaconus]] in the heart of Germania.&lt;ref&gt;[[F. A. Ukert]], ''Die Amazonen'', Abhandlungen der philosophisch-philologischen Classe der Königlich Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften (1849), 63..&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval and Renaissance literature==
[[File:Dahomey amazon1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Dahomey Amazons]] were so named by Western observers due to their similarity to the mythical Amazons]]

Amazons continued to be discussed by authors of the European Renaissance, and with the [[Age of Exploration]], they were located in ever more remote areas. In 1542, [[Francisco de Orellana]] reached the [[Amazon River]] (''Amazonas'' in Spanish), naming it after a tribe of warlike women he claimed to have encountered and fought on the [[Nhamundá River]], a tributary of the Amazon.&lt;ref&gt;It has been suggested that what Orellana actually engaged was an especially warlike tribe of Native Americans whose warrior men had long hair and thus appeared to him as women. See Theobaldo Miranda Santos, ''Lendas e mitos do Brasil'' ("Brazil's legends and myths"), Companhia Editora Nacional, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards the whole basin and region of the Amazon (''Amazônia'' in Portuguese, ''Amazonía'' in Spanish) were named after the river. Amazons also figure in the accounts of both [[Christopher Columbus]] and [[Walter Raleigh]].&lt;ref&gt;Ukert (1849), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Famous medieval traveller [[John Mandeville]] mentions them in his book:

{{quote|Beside the land of Chaldea is the land of Amazonia, that is the land of Feminye. And in that realm is all woman and no man; not as some may say, that men may not live there, but for because that the women will not suffer no men amongst them to be their sovereigns.&lt;ref&gt;''The Travels of Sir John Mandeville'', Dover publications, Mineola, New York, 2006, cap. XVII, p. 103-104&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Medieval and Renaissance authors credit the Amazons with the invention of the [[Corded Ware culture|battle-axe]]. This is probably related to the ''[[sagaris]]'', an axe-like weapon associated with both Amazons and Scythian tribes by Greek authors (see also [[Thracian tomb of Aleksandrovo kurgan]]). [[Paulus Hector Mair]] expresses astonishment that such a "manly weapon" should have been invented by a "tribe of women", but he accepts the attribution out of respect for his authority, [[Johannes Aventinus]].

[[Ludovico Ariosto|Ariosto]]'s ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'' contains a country of warrior women, ruled by Queen Orontea; the epic describes an origin much like that in Greek myth, in that the women, abandoned by a band of warriors and unfaithful lovers, rallied together to form a nation from which men were severely reduced, to prevent them from regaining power. The Amazons and Queen Hippolyta are also referenced in [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]]'' in "[[The Knight's Tale]]".

==Historical background==
[[Classics|Classicist]] Peter Walcot wrote, "Wherever the Amazons are located by the Greeks, whether it is somewhere along the Black Sea in the distant north-east, or in Libya in the furthest south, it is always beyond the confines of [[Civilization|the civilized world]]. The Amazons exist outside the range of normal human experience."&lt;ref&gt;P. Walcot, "Greek Attitudes towards Women: The Mythological Evidence" ''Greece &amp; Rome''2nd Series 31.1 (April 1984, pp. 37-47) p 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, there are various proposals for a historical nucleus of the Amazons of Greek historiography, the most obvious candidates being historical [[Scythia]] and [[Sarmatia]] in line with the account by [[Herodotus]], but some authors prefer a comparison to cultures of Asia Minor or even [[Minoan Crete]].

==Archaeology==
===Scythians and Sarmatians===
Speculation that the idea of Amazons contains a core of reality is based on archaeological findings from burials, pointing to the possibility that some Sarmatian women may have participated in battle. These findings have led scholars to suggest that the Amazonian legend in [[Greek mythology]] may have been "inspired by real warrior women".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stoa.org/diotima/essays/wilde.shtml |title=Lyn Webster Wilde, "Did the Amazons really exist?" '&amp;#39;Diotima'&amp;#39; |publisher=Stoa.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence of high-ranking warrior women comes from [[kurgan]]s in southern Ukraine and Russia.
David Anthony notes, "About 20% of [[Scythians|Scythian]]-[[Sarmatian]] 'warrior graves' on the lower [[Don River (Russia)|Don]] and lower [[Volga river|Volga]] contained women dressed for battle similar to how men dress, a phenomenon that probably inspired the Greek tales about the Amazons."&lt;ref name="anthonyd"&gt;{{cite book| last = Anthony| first = David W.| title = The Horse, the Wheel, and Language: How Bronze-Age Riders from the Eurasian Steppes Shaped the Modern World| url = https://books.google.com/?id=mTxQmQEACAAJ| year = 2007| publisher = Princeton University Press| isbn = 0-691-05887-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Amazone Staatliche Antikensammlungen 2342.jpg|thumb|Mounted Amazon in [[Scythia]]n costume, on an [[Attica|Attic]] red-figure vase, {{circa}}420 BC]]
Up to 25% of military burials were of armed Sarmatian women usually including bows.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stoa.org/diotima/essays/wilde.shtml |title=Diotima |publisher=Stoa.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russian archaeologist Vera Kovalevskaya points out that when Scythian men were away fighting or hunting, nomadic women would have to be able to defend themselves, their animals and pasture-grounds competently. During the time that the Scythians advanced into Asia and achieved near-[[hegemony]] in the Near East, there was a period of twenty-eight years when the men would have been away on campaigns for long periods. During this time the women would not only have had to defend themselves, but to reproduce, and this could well be the origin of the idea that Amazons mated once a year with their neighbours, if Herodotus actually based his accounts on fact.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

Before modern archaeology uncovered some of the Scythian burials of warrior-maidens entombed under [[kurgan]]s in the region of [[Altai Mountains]] and Sarmatia,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archaeology.org/9701/abstracts/sarmatians.html "Warrior Women of Eurasia"], Archaeology Magazine (Abstract) Volume 50 Number 1, January/February 1997 Retrieved 7/10/08.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;In a recent excavation of [[Sarmatian]] sites by Dr. Jeannine Davis-Kimball,{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} a tomb was found wherein female warriors were buried.&lt;/ref&gt; giving concrete form at last to the Greek tales, the origin of the Amazon story had been the subject of speculation among classics scholars. In the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|1911 ''Encyclopædia Britannica'']] speculation ranged along the following lines:

{{quote|While some regard the Amazons as a purely mythical people, others assume an historical foundation for them. The deities worshipped by them were [[Ares]] (who is consistently assigned to them as a god of war, and as a god of [[Thrace|Thracian]] and generally northern origin) and [[Artemis]], not the usual Greek goddess of that name, but an Asiatic deity in some respects her equivalent. It is conjectured that the Amazons were originally the temple-servants and priestesses (''hierodulae'') of this goddess; and that the removal of the breast corresponded with the self-mutilation of the god [[Attis]] and the [[galli]], Roman priests of [[Cybele|Rhea Cybele]]. Another theory is that, as the knowledge of geography extended, travellers brought back reports of tribes ruled entirely by women, who carried out the duties which elsewhere were regarded as peculiar to man, in whom alone the rights of nobility and inheritance were vested, and who had the supreme control of affairs. Hence arose the belief in the Amazons as a nation of female warriors, organized and governed entirely by women. According to J. Viirtheim (''De Ajacis'' origine, 1907), the Amazons were of Greek origin [...] It has been suggested that the fact of the conquest of the Amazons being assigned to the two famous heroes of Greek mythology, Heracles and Theseus [...] shows that they were mythical illustrations of the dangers which beset the Greeks on the coasts of Asia Minor; rather perhaps, it may be intended to represent the conflict between the Greek culture of the colonies on the [[Black Sea|Euxine]] and the barbarism of the native inhabitants.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;}}

===Minoan Crete===
[[File:Departure of the Amazons MET DP318355.jpg|thumb|''Departure of the Amazons'', by [[Claude Deruet]], 1620]]

When [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] archeology was still in its infancy, nevertheless, a theory raised in an essay regarding the Amazons contributed by [[Lewis Richard Farnell]] and [[John Myres]] to [[Robert Ranulph Marett]]'s ''Anthropology and the Classics'' (1908),&lt;ref&gt;L.R. Farnell and J.L. Myres, "Herodotus and anthropology" in [[Robert Ranulph Marett|Robert R. Marett]] ''Anthropology and the Classics'' 1908, pp. 138ff.&lt;/ref&gt; placed their possible origins in Minoan civilization, drawing attention to overlooked similarities between the two cultures. According to Myres,&lt;ref&gt;(pp.&amp;nbsp;153 ff)&lt;/ref&gt; the tradition interpreted in the light of evidence furnished by supposed Amazon cults seems to have been very similar and may have even originated in Minoan culture. &lt;!--The following is a "hard sell" for an outdated idea: "The theory that the Amazons originally represented Minoan Crete's women has a strong case based on what [[archeologists]] and historians have been discovering about Minoan culture. Out of all the ancient civilizations which are so far known to archaeologists and historians the Minoans seem to fit most of the aspects that classical Greeks and later scholars have come to associate with the Amazonian culture."--&gt;

==Modern legacy==

[[File:Juliusz Kossak - Amazonka.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Juliusz Kossak]] "An Amazon"]]
[[Francisco de Orellana]] gave the [[Amazon river]] its name after reporting pitched battles with tribes of female warriors, whom he likened to the Amazons.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/place/Amazon-River Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of [[Samsun]] in modern-day [[Turkey]] features a recently constructed "Amazon Village" museum, created to bring attention to the legacy of the Amazons and to generate both academic interest and popular tourism.&lt;ref name="todayszaman"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/newsDetail_getNewsById.action?load=detay&amp;link=212625 |title=Village of Amazons to be recreated in Samsun park - Today's Zaman, your gateway to Turkish daily news |publisher=Todayszaman.com |date=2010-06-10 |accessdate=2014-01-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201214800/http://www.todayszaman.com/newsDetail_getNewsById.action?load=detay&amp;link=212625 |archivedate=2014-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A festival is also held every year in the [[Terme]] district of [[Samsun Province]] to celebrate the Amazons.&lt;ref name="todayszaman" /&gt;

In Greece, female [[equestrians]] are also called "Amazons" ({{lang-el|Αμαζόνες}}).

Amazons became an important subject of the fine arts around 1900, especially in the work of the Munich painter and sculptor [[Franz Stuck]] (1863-1928). 

In Nazi-Germany open air events called "Nacht der Amazonen" ([[Night of the Amazons]]) were performed at [[Nymphenburg Palace]] in [[Munich]] between 1936 and 1939. These revues with bare-breasted girls presented an allegedly emancipated female role as part of the „new race“ intended to be realized by racial fanatics.

*The [[Dahomey Amazons]] were an all-female military regiment of the [[Kingdom of Dahomey]] in present-day Benin – the nickname was given by western observers.

===Movements===
* During the period 1905–1913, members of the militant [[Suffragette]] movement were frequently referred to as "Amazons" in books and newspaper articles.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Gretchen "With All Her Might: The Life of Gertrude Harding, Militant Suffragette" (Holmes &amp; Meier Publishing, April 1998)&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[Ukraine]] Katerina Tarnovska leads a group called the Asgarda which claims to be a new tribe of Amazons.&lt;ref name="pri.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pri.org/stories/politics-society/social-justice/ukraine%E2%80%99s-asgarda-martial-arts-program-recasts-amazon-warrior-women-13825.html |title=Ukraine’s Asgarda martial arts program recasts Amazon warrior women &amp;#124; Public Radio International |publisher=Pri.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tarnovska believes that the Amazons are the direct ancestors of Ukrainian women, and she has created an all-female martial art for her group, based on another form of fighting called [[Combat Hopak]], but with a special emphasis on self-defense.&lt;ref name="pri.org"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7001">[[Image:Samuel Johnson by Joshua Reynolds 2.png|thumb|200px|upright|Samuel Johnson's ''Lives of the Poets'' (1779–81) was possibly the first thorough-going exercise in biographical criticism.&lt;ref&gt;http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/criticism&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''Biographical criticism''' is a form of [[literary criticism]] which analyzes a writer's biography to show the relationship between the author's life and their works of literature.&lt;ref&gt;"Biographical Criticism", ''Writing essays about literature: a guide and style sheet'' (2004), Kelley Griffith, University of North Carolina at Greensborough, Wadsworth Publishing Company , pages 177-178, 400&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benson, Jackson J. (1989) "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/25111810 Steinbeck: A Defense of Biographical Criticism]" ''College Literature'' 16(29): pp. 107-116, page 108&lt;/ref&gt; Biographical criticism is often associated with [[historical-biographical criticism]],&lt;ref&gt;http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/college_literature/v030/30.1knoper.html&lt;/ref&gt; a critical method that "sees a literary work chiefly, if not exclusively, as a reflection of its author's life and times".&lt;ref&gt;Wilfred L. Guerin, A handbook of critical approaches to literature, Edition 5, 2005, page 51, 57-61; Oxford University Press, University of Michigan&lt;/ref&gt;

This longstanding critical method dates back at least to the [[Renaissance]] period,&lt;ref&gt;Stuart, Duane Reed (1922) "Biographical Criticism of Vergil since the Renaissance" ''Studies in Philology'' 19(1): pp. 1-30, page 1 ''et seq.''&lt;/ref&gt; and was employed extensively by Samuel Johnson in his ''[[Lives of the Poets]]'' (1779–81).&lt;ref&gt;http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/criticism "Samuel Johnson's Lives of the Poets (1779–81) was the first thorough-going exercise in biographical criticism, the attempt to relate a writer's background and life to his works."&lt;/ref&gt;

Like any critical methodology, biographical criticism can be used with discretion and insight or employed as a superficial shortcut to understanding the literary work on its own terms through such strategies as [[Formalism (literature)|Formalism]].  Hence 19th century biographical criticism came under disapproval by the so-called [[New Critics]] of the 1920s, who coined the term "[[biographical fallacy]]"&lt;ref&gt;Lees, Francis Noel (1967) "The Keys Are at the Palace: A Note on Criticism and Biography" pp. 135-149 ''In'' Damon, Philip (editor)  (1967) ''Literary Criticism and Historical Understanding: Selected Papers from the English Institute'' Columbia University Press, New York, {{OCLC|390148}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Discussed extensively in Frye, Herman Northrop (1947) ''Fearful Symmetry: A Study of William Blake'' Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey,  page 326 and following, {{OCLC|560970612}}&lt;/ref&gt; to describe criticism that neglected the imaginative genesis of literature.

Notwithstanding this critique, biographical criticism remained a significant mode of literary inquiry throughout the 20th century, particularly in studies of [[Charles Dickens]] and [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]], among others. The method continues to be employed in the study of such authors as [[John Steinbeck]],&lt;ref&gt;Benson, Jackson J. (1989) "Steinbeck: A Defense of Biographical Criticism" ''College Literature'' 16(29): pp. 107-116, page 108&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walt Whitman]]&lt;ref&gt;Knoper, Randall (2003)[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3709/is_200301/ai_n9212440/ "Walt Whitman and New Biographical Criticism"] ''College Literature'' 30(1): pp. 161-168&lt;/ref&gt; and [[William Shakespeare]].&lt;ref&gt;Schiffer, James (ed), ''Shakespeare's Sonnets: Critical Essays'' (1999),pp. 19-27, 40-43, 45, 47, 395&lt;/ref&gt;

== Peripatetic biographical criticism ==
In ''The Cambridge history of literary criticism: Classical criticism'', in a chapter titled "Peripatetic Biographical Criticism", George Alexander Kennedy notes that in the [[Hellenistic]] age, "The works of authors were read as sources of information about their lives, personalities and interests. Some of this material was then used by other commentators and critics to explain passages in their works. The process became a circular one in that, though Peripatetic biographers utilized external evidence where available, they had little to go on and quarried the texts for hints".&lt;ref&gt;George Alexander Kennedy, The Cambridge history of literary criticism: Classical criticism, page 205, Cambridge University Press, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recognition of otherness ==
Jackson J. Benson describes the form as a "'recognition of 'otherness'—that there is an author who is different in personality and background from the reader—appears to be a simple-minded proposition. Yet as a basic prerequisite to the understanding and evaluation of a literary text it is often ignored even by the most sophisticated literary critics. The exploration of otherness is what literary biography and biographical criticism can do best, discovering an author as a unique individual, a discovery that puts a burden on us to reach out to recognize that uniqueness before we can fully comprehend an author's writings.'"&lt;ref&gt;Benson, Jackson J. (1989) "Steinbeck: A Defense of Biographical Criticism" ''College Literature'' 16(29): pp. 107-116, page 108&lt;/ref&gt;

==Connections to other modes of criticism==
Biographical criticism shares in common with [[New Historicism]] an interest in the fact that all literary works are situated in specific historical and biographical contexts from which they are generated. Biographical Criticism, like New Historicism, rejects the concept that literary studies should be limited to the internal or formal characteristics of a literary work, and insists that it properly includes a knowledge of the contexts in which the work was created. Biographical criticism stands in ambiguous relationship to [[Romanticism]]. It has often been argued that it is a development from Romanticism, but it also stands in opposition to the Romantic tendency to view literature as manifesting a "universal" transcendence of the particular conditions of its genesis.

== Assessments of biographical criticism and literary biography ==
In ''The Art of Literary Biography'' (1995), John Worthen writes:
:&lt;blockquote&gt;'The fact that we ''want'' an emergent sense of the inevitable development suggests the enormously soothing quality which biographies have come to have in our age. Not only do biographies suggest that things as difficult as human lives can – for all their obvious complexity – be summed up, known, comprehended: they reassure us that, while we are reading, a world will be created in which there are few or no unclear motives, muddled decisions, or (indeed) loose ends.'&lt;ref&gt;John Worthen, 'The Necessary Ignorance of a Biographer,' in John Batchelor (ed.) ''The Art of Literary Biography'', Clarendon Press, Oxford 1995 pp.227-244, p.231&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A '''biographical film''', or '''biopic''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|aɪ|əʊ|p|ɪ|k}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forvo.com/word/biopic/#en|title=biopic pronunciation: How to pronounce biopic in English, German|first=Forvo|last=Team|date=|website=forvo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; abbreviation for ''biographical motion picture''), is a film that dramatizes the life of a [[non-fictional]] or [[historically]]-based person or people. Such films show the life of a historical person and the central character's real name is used.&lt;ref name=bas2009&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bastin|first=Giselle|title=Filming the Ineffable: Biopics of the British Royal Family|journal=Auto/Biography Studies|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/abs/summary/v024/24.1.bastin.html|date=Summer 2009|volume=24|issue=1|pages=34–52|accessdate=29 May 2013|doi=10.1353/abs.2009.0008}}&lt;/ref&gt; They differ from films "[[docudrama|based on a true story]]" or "[[historical drama film]]s" in that they attempt to comprehensively tell a single person's life story or at least the most historically important years of their lives.{{Original research inline|date=October 2015}}

Because the figures portrayed are actual people, whose actions and characteristics are known to the public (or at least historically documented), biopic roles are considered some of the most demanding of actors and actresses.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} [[Ben Kingsley]], [[Johnny Depp]], [[Jim Carrey]], and [[Jamie Foxx]] all gained new-found respect as dramatic actors after starring in biopics:{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Ben Kingsley as [[Mahatma Gandhi]] in ''[[Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]]'' (1982), Depp as [[Ed Wood]] in ''[[Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood]]'' (1994), Carrey as [[Andy Kaufman]] in ''[[Man on the Moon (film)|Man on the Moon]]'' (1999), and Foxx as [[Ray Charles]] in ''[[Ray (film)|Ray]]'' (2004).

In rare cases, sometimes called '''auto biopics''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/autobiopic|title=autobiopic - definition of autobiopic in English {{!}} Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; the subject of the film plays himself or herself: [[Jackie Robinson]] in ''[[The Jackie Robinson Story]]''; [[Muhammad Ali]] in ''[[The Greatest (1977 film)|The Greatest]]''; [[Audie Murphy]] in ''[[To Hell and Back (film)|To Hell and Back]]''; [[Patty Duke]] in ''[[Call Me Anna (film)|Call Me Anna]]''; [[Bob Mathias]] in ''[[The Bob Mathias Story]]'', [[Arlo Guthrie]] in ''[[Alice's Restaurant (film)|Alice's Restaurant]]''; [[Fantasia Barrino]] in ''[[Life Is Not a Fairytale: The Fantasia Barrino Story|Life Is Not a Fairytale]]''; and [[Howard Stern]] in ''[[Private Parts (1997 film)|Private Parts]]''.

Biopic scholars include [[George F. Custen]] of the [[College of Staten Island]] and [[Dennis P. Bingham]] of [[Indiana University – Purdue University Indianapolis]]. Custen, in ''Bio/Pics: How Hollywood Constructed Public History'' (1992), regards the genre as having died with the [[Studio system|Hollywood studio era]], and in particular, [[Darryl F. Zanuck]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Custen |first=George F. |title=Bio/pics : how Hollywood constructed public history |page= |publisher=Rutgers University Press |date=1992 |oclc=24247491 |isbn=9780813517551 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, Bingham's 2010 study ''Whose Lives Are They Anyway? The Biopic as Contemporary Film Genre''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bingham |first=Dennis |title=Whose Lives Are They Anyway? The Biopic as Contemporary Film Genre |page= |publisher=Rutgers University Press |date=2010 |oclc=318970570 |isbn=9780813546582}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows how it perpetuates as a codified genre using many of the same tropes used in the studio era that has followed a similar trajectory as that shown by [[Rick Altman]] in his study, ''[[Film/Genre]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Film/genre |last=Altman |first=Rick |year=1999 |publisher=British Film Institute |page= |oclc=41071380 |isbn=9780851707174 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bingham also addresses the male biopic and the female biopic as distinct genres from each other, the former generally dealing with great accomplishments, the latter generally dealing with female victimization. Ellen Cheshire's ''Bio-Pics: a life in pictures'' (2014) examines UK/US films from the 1990s and 2000s. Each chapter reviews key films linked by profession and concludes with further viewing list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cheshire |first=Ellen |title=Bio-Pics: a life in pictures |page= |publisher=Columbia University Press |date=2014 |oclc= |isbn=9780231172059 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Christopher Robé has also written on the gender norms that underlie the biopic in his article, "Taking Hollywood Back" in the 2009 issue of ''Cinema Journal''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Robé |first=Christopher |title=Taking Hollywood Back: The Historical Costume Drama, the Biopic, and Popular Front U.S. Film Criticism |jstor=20484449 |journal=Cinema Journal |volume=48 |issue=2 |date=Winter 2009 |pages=70–87 |doi=10.1353/cj.0.0082}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{Anchor|Ebert}} [[Roger Ebert]] defended ''The Hurricane'' and distortions in biographical films in general, stating "those who seek the truth about a man from the film of his life might as well seek it from his loving grandmother. ... ''The Hurricane'' is not a [[Documentary film|documentary]] but a [[parable]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Roger |last=Ebert |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-hurricane-2000 |date=January 7, 2000 |title=The Hurricane |newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anchor|stretch}} Some biopics purposely stretch the truth. ''[[Confessions of a Dangerous Mind]]'' was based on [[game show]] host [[Chuck Barris]]' widely debunked yet popular [[memoir]] of the same name, in which he claimed to be a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,404266,00.html|title=Chuck Barris: Lying to Tell the Truth |last=Stein |first=Joel |date=2003-01-07 |newspaper=Time |issn=0040-781X |access-date=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Kafka (film)|Kafka]]'' incorporated both the life of author [[Franz Kafka]] and the [[surrealism|surreal]] aspects of his fiction.{{citation needed|date=June 2010}} The [[Errol Flynn]] film ''[[They Died with Their Boots On]]'' tells the story of [[George Armstrong Custer|Custer]] but is highly romanticized. The [[Oliver Stone]] film ''[[The Doors (film)|The Doors]]'', mainly about [[Jim Morrison]], was highly praised for the similarities between Jim Morrison and actor [[Val Kilmer]], look-wise and singing-wise, but fans and band members did not like the way Oliver Stone portrayed Jim Morrison,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Gary James' Interview with Ray Manzarek |url= http://www.classicbands.com/RayManzarekInterview.html |publisher=Classicbands |accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a few of the scenes were even completely made up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.crystal-ship.com/entrevues.php?cht=03 |title=Chat with Ray Manzarek |publisher=Crystal-ship|date=17 November 1997 |accessdate=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Casting can be controversial for biographical films. Casting is often a balance between similarity in looks and ability to portray the characteristics of the person. [[Anthony Hopkins]] felt that he should not have played [[Richard Nixon]] in ''[[Nixon (film)|Nixon]]'' because of a lack of resemblance between the two.{{citation needed|date=June 2010}} The casting of [[John Wayne]] as [[Genghis Khan]] in ''[[The Conqueror (1956 film)|The Conqueror]]'' was objected to because of the American Wayne being cast as the Mongol warlord. Egyptian critics criticized the casting of [[Louis Gossett, Jr.]], an African American actor, as Egyptian president [[Anwar Sadat]] in the 1982 TV miniseries ''[[Sadat (film)|Sadat]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/02/movies/upset-by-sadat-egypt-bars-columbia-films.html|title=UPSET BY 'SADAT,' EGYPT BARS COLUMBIA FILMS|last=Times|first=Judith Miller, Special To The New York|date=1984-02-02|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, some objected to the casting of [[Jennifer Lopez]] in ''[[Selena (film)|Selena]]'' because she is a New York City native of [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] descent while [[Selena]] was [[Mexican-American]].&lt;ref&gt;Tracy, Kathleen (2008).

"'''Brit Pack'''" is a term that has been used to refer to specific groups of young British actors who have achieved success in Hollywood, as well as more generally to the entire group of such actors. According to one article, "every decade brings a new Brit Pack, another disparate group of actors backed by the media to achieve simultaneous Hollywood stardom."&lt;ref name="talktalk.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talktalk.co.uk/entertainment/film/biography/artist/tim-roth/biography/122|title=Tim Roth – Biography|author=TalkTalk web studio|publisher=talktalk.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the term is most closely associated with the crop of British actors which emerged in the late 1980s, because of the prominence of the American [[Brat Pack (actors)|Brat Pack]] actors at that time.

==1980s Brit Pack==
The journalist Elissa Van Poznak interviewed [[Gary Oldman]], [[Tim Roth]], [[Paul McGann]], [[Bruce Payne]], [[Spencer Leigh (actor)|Spencer Leigh]], and [[Colin Firth]] for ''[[The Face (magazine)|The Face]]'' magazine, in January 1987. The magazine had also intended to interview [[Daniel Day-Lewis]] but he was busy filming ''[[The Unbearable Lightness of Being (film)|The Unbearable Lightness of Being]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agwlbp.com/facejan.html|title=HugeDomains.com – Agwlbp.com is for Sale (Agwlbp)|publisher=agwlbp.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title of the interview was "The Brit Pack". The moniker stuck and has been referenced in subsequent articles concerning the actors.&lt;ref name="talktalk.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tim-roth.com/index.php?id=facejul90|title=Tim Roth: Press|publisher=tim-roth.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; An issue of the 1988 magazine [[Film Comment]] stated that '[[Rupert Everett]], [[Gary Oldman]], [[Miranda Richardson]], and [[Daniel Day-Lewis]]' were the leaders of the pack.&lt;ref name="americancinemapapers.com"&gt;[http://www.americancinemapapers.com/files/BRIT_PACK.htm BRIT PACK: A CLUTCH OF ACTORS], Harlan Kennedy, ''American Cinema Papers'' 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

==The New Brit Pack==
In July 1993, an article for ''The Face'' was titled ''The New Brit Pack'', which included [[Jaye Davidson]], [[Naveen Andrews]], [[Jude Law]], [[David Thewlis]], [[Craig Kelly (actor)|Craig Kelly]], [[Samuel West]] and [[Rufus Sewell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=The Face Magazine Editors|title=The Face Magazine – Jaye Davidson Cover|url=http://www.crazyaboutmagazines.com/ourshop/prod_571877-The-Face-magazine-Jaye-Davidson-cover-July-1993-Volume-2-No-58.html|accessdate=1 November 2015|work=[[The Face (magazine)|The Face]]|date=10 July 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differences from other "packs"==
Unlike the Brat Pack or other similarly defined groups of American actors, "Brit Pack" actors have rarely associated with each other socially or in film. As a 1988 article put it, the Brit Pack "aren't seen together at parties or in restaurants or in gossip columns. And since British cinema has had no equivalent to Hollywood's Eighties conveyor-belt youth movies – ''[[Weird Science (film)|Weird Science]]'', ''[[About Last Night...]]'', ''[[St. Elmo's Fire (film)|St. Elmo's Fire]]'', et al. – they don't keep re-meeting each other on-screen either".&lt;ref name="americancinemapapers.com"/&gt; Nonetheless, [[Bruce Payne]] and [[Tim Roth]] had both appeared in the ''Tales Out of School'' television series, [[Gary Oldman]] and [[Tim Roth]] both appeared in ''[[Meantime (film)|Meantime]]'' and ''[[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead (film)|Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead]]'', Gary Oldman and Colin Firth appeared together in [[Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (film)|Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy]] and [[Bruce Payne]] and Spencer Leigh both appeared in ''[[Smart Money (1986 film)|Smart Money]]''.

==Later uses of the term==
Currently, the phrase 'Brit Pack' is often used to describe any disparate group of young British actors and actresses of rising prominence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/the-britpack--our-new-generation-of-movie-stars-takes-tinseltown-841199.html | location=London | work=The Independent | date=6 June 2008 | title=The Britpack – Our new generation of movie stars takes Tinseltown}}&lt;/ref&gt; No group has emerged which is as readily identifiable as the group from the 1980s.{{whom| date=November 2017}}

In 2014, it was used to describe a new wave of actors born in the late 1970s and early 1980s who were garnering success in Hollywood. These actors include [[Benedict Cumberbatch]], [[Tom Hiddleston]], [[Henry Cavill]], [[James McAvoy]], [[Tom Hardy]], [[Eddie Redmayne]] and [[Rupert Friend]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shortlist.com/entertainment/best-of-british-tom-hiddleston|title=Best of British|work=ShortList Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/features/hot-british-men?src=spr_TWITTER&amp;spr_id=1447_64563853#slide-1|title=Hottest British Actors – 10 Best British Actors|author=Rebecca Cope|work=Harper's BAZAAR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6906">[[File:Albrecht Dürer - Coat of Arms of the House of Dürer - WGA07258.jpg|right|thumb|[[Canting arms]] of [[Albrecht Dürer]]]]
'''Burgher arms''' are [[Coat of arms|coats of arms]] borne by persons of the ''burgher'' social class of [[Europe]] (usually called ''bourgeois'' in English) since the [[Middle Ages]]. By definition, however, the term is alien to [[British heraldry]], which follows other rules.

Although the term ''burgher'' arms refers to the [[bourgeoisie]], it is often extended also to arms of (Protestant) clergy and even to arms of [[peasant]]s.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In several European countries, the use of armorial bearings was restricted to a particular social class, e.g. the use of [[Supporters (heraldry)|supporters]] in [[Coat of arms#United Kingdom|Great Britain]], [[Tincture (heraldry)|tinctures]] in [[Portuguese heraldry|Portugal]] or [[coronets]] in [[Swedish heraldry#Noble arms|Sweden]]. In other countries, every individual, family and community has been free to adopt arms and use it as they please, provided they have not wrongfully assumed the arms of another.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michel Pastoureau]], ''[https://books.google.com/books/about/Heraldry.html?id=XFfkAQAACAAJ Heraldry: Its Origins and Meaning]'', '[[New Horizons (Thames &amp; Hudson)|New Horizons]]' series. (Thames &amp; Hudson 1997), {{p.|14}}.&lt;/ref&gt;   
 
Use of coats of arms by burghers and artisans began during the 13th century and in the 14th century some peasants took to using arms.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl-Alexander von Volborth]]. Heraldry: Customs, Rules, and Styles. (Blandford Press, Dorset: 1981), p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; The arms of burghers bore a far wider variety of [[Charge (heraldry)|charges]] than the arms of nobility like everyday objects, in particular, [[tool]]s. In burgher arms are met sometimes also [[house mark]]s which are not met in arms of nobility. Most widespread burgher heraldry was and still is in [[Switzerland]] and in the [[Netherlands]]. In the Netherlands only a small percentage of the existing arms belong to the nobility.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl-Alexander von Volborth]]. Heraldry: Customs, Rules, and Styles. (Blandford Press, Dorset: 1981), p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;

Crest-[[coronet]]s in burgher arms are correct only if the arms were granted by a sovereign and the coronet is explicitly mentioned in the grant.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl-Alexander von Volborth]]. The Art of Heraldry. Tiger Books International, London. 1991, p. 59 {{ISBN|1-85501-154-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
== Germany ==
Although assumption of arms always remained free, the emperors of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] since [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] began to grant arms without raising people to nobiliary status. In the 15th century the authority to grant arms was delegated to “[[Hofpfalzgraf|Counts Palatine of the Imperial Court]]” ({{lang-de|[[:de:Hofpfalzgraf|Hofpfalzgrafen]]}}), who from then on also granted arms to burghers. This was regarded as luxury everyone was not able to afford.

The [[tilting helmet]] was prescribed for arms of non-nobles, while the barred helmet was restricted by the imperial chancellery to the nobility as upholders of the tradition of tourneying. This privilege was also shared by certain people who enjoyed the same standing as the nobility, e.g. those who had a doctor's title in law or theology.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ottfried Neubecker]]: A Guide to Heraldry. Cassell, London 1981, p.161. {{ISBN|0-304-30751-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Custom of the use of the barred helmet was also followed by city [[Patricianship|patricians]].&lt;ref name="Heraldik 1998 p. 173"&gt;[[Handbuch der Heraldik: Wappenfibel]]. (19th expanded edition). Edited by Ludwig Biewer. (Degener &amp; Co, Neustadt an der Aisch 1998), p. 173&lt;/ref&gt; Although the rule of the use of the tilting helmet by burghers was not always obeyed, it has still become the norm in many countries of the [[Heraldry#German-Nordic heraldry|German-Nordic heraldic tradition]], e.g. in [[Swedish heraldry]].

After the fall of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], arms were no longer granted to burghers except in the [[Kingdom of Saxony]], where such grants continued from 1911 until 1918.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} Elsewhere burgher arms were assumed. Such family heraldry is still alive in Germany and burgher arms [[law of arms|are protected by law]].

== France ==
Burgher arms used to be common in [[France]], but they disappeared in the [[French Revolution]], which was hostile to heraldry. In the end of the 17th century, an attempt was made to list all arms in ''[[Armorial général (of France)|Armorial général]]'' as a device to increase tax revenue. When the attempt failed, in order to force people to pay tax, arms were given to many burghers who had never had them. These arms were never used by their recipients.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michel Pastoureau]], Heraldry: its origins and meaning (Thames &amp; Hudson 1997), p. 33-36&lt;/ref&gt; In France burgher arms are not supposed to have a helmet.

== Portugal ==
Burgher arms had a complicated and suppressed history in Portugal. During the reign of King [[Afonso V of Portugal|Afonso V]], burgher arms were restricted to the use of colours only. This restriction would become irrelevant when King [[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel I]] forbade the use of arms to those who were not of the [[Portuguese nobility]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Slater: The Complete Book of Heraldry. Lorenz Books 2002, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; This restriction against burgher arms in Portugal lasted until 1910.

== Arms of peasants ==
In some regions ([[Normandy]], [[County of Flanders|Flanders]]) even peasants sometimes bore arms.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michel Pastoureau]], Heraldry: its origins and meaning (Thames &amp; Hudson 1997), p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[Switzerland]] 14th century arms of farmers are known, but they are rare and did not become numerous until the 17th century,&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl-Alexander von Volborth]]. Heraldry: Customs, Rules, and Styles. (Blandford Press, Dorset: 1981), p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in [[Lower Saxony]], [[Frisia]] and [[county of Tyrol|Tyrol]], where farmers had personal freedom.&lt;ref name="Heraldik 1998 p. 173" /&gt; In [[Denmark]] arms of farmers are preserved on seals from about 1300.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl-Alexander von Volborth]]. Heraldry: Customs, Rules, and Styles. (Blandford Press, Dorset: 1981), p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Norway]] peasants have used arms since the Middle Ages and some of the arms have even been used as family arms.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Krag: ''Norsk heraldisk mønstring fra Frederik IV's regjeringstid 1699-1730'', Bind II Bønder, (1942 – 1955) and Allan Tønnesen (ed.): ''Magtens besegling.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11972">A '''character arc''' is the transformation or inner journey&lt;ref name="Gerke"&gt;{{harvtxt|Gerke|2010|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; of a [[character (arts)|character]] over the course of a story. If a story has a character arc, the character begins as one sort of person and gradually transforms into a different sort of person in response to changing developments in the story. Since the change is often substantive and leading from one personality trait to a diametrically opposite trait (for example, from greed to benevolence), the geometric term ''[[Arc (geometry)|arc]]'' is often used to describe the sweeping change. In most stories, [[main character|lead characters]] and [[protagonist]]s are the characters most likely to experience character arcs,&lt;ref name="Bell"&gt;{{harvtxt|Bell|2004|p=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it is possible for lesser characters to change as well.&lt;ref name="Gerke" /&gt; A driving element of the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]]s of many stories is that the main character seems initially unable to overcome opposing forces, possibly because they lack skills or knowledge or resources or friends. To overcome such obstacles, the protagonist must change, possibly by learning new skills, to arrive at a higher sense of self-awareness or capability. Protagonists can achieve such self-awareness by interacting with their environment, by enlisting the help of mentors, by changing their viewpoint, or by some other method.

==Dramatic narrative structure==
{{main|Dramatic structure}}
Throughout the trajectory of narratives with a tripartite structure, character arcs often unfold beside the narrative arc in the following way:

===First act===
During the first act, the character arc is established or re-established for at least one character, the main character (the protagonist), within the exposition (noument) of the environment including relationships to other characters. Later in the first act, a dynamic, on-screen incident, known as the [[Inciting Incident|inciting incident]], or catalyst occurs that confronts the protagonist, whose attempts to deal with this incident lead to a second and more dramatic situation, known as the first [[Climax (narrative)|turning point]].  After the first turning point, life will never be the same for the protagonist and raises a dramatic question that will be answered in the climax of the story. The dramatic question should be framed in terms of the protagonist's call to action, for example, Will X recover the diamond? Will Y get the girl? Will Z capture the killer?&lt;ref name=bible&gt;{{harvtxt|Trottier|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second act===
During the second act, also referred to as "[[rising action]]", the character arc develops as the protagonist attempts to resolve the problem initiated by the first turning point, only to discover ever-worsening situations, which often lead to the learning of new skills, the discovery of capabilities, and (sometimes late in the second act if at all) the raising of self-awareness.&lt;ref name=bible /&gt;

===Third act===
During the third act, including the climax, "[[falling action]]" and resolution (denouement), the narrative arc is completed although the character arc typically is not.  During the climax, because the main tensions of the story are brought to their most intense point and the dramatic question is answered, a character arc reaches a place where the character gains a new sense of who they are becoming.  As the plot and its subplots resolve, the character arc's emphasis shifts from the learning of any new skills or the discovery of dormant capabilities to the awakening of a higher level of self-awareness, which in turn changes who the character is becoming.&lt;ref name=bible /&gt;

== Examples ==

=== In literature ===
Some examples include:

* [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]'' sees the eponymous character, once a young scholarly prince full of promise, quickly becoming a melancholic brooder after his father's death. The play shows his slow but deadly fall into madness.
* In [[Dostoevsky]]'s ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'', the protagonist [[Raskolnikov]] commits a murder, that leads him on a path of redemption, and after an intense inner struggle, he realizes that he needs to be punished for his actions, reporting himself to the authorities.
* [[Victor Hugo]]'s ''[[Les Misérables]]'' includes a myriad of characters that transform against the backdrop of social events. [[Jean Valjean]] starts as a selfish, violent convict and develops into a generous and loving father to [[Cosette]], who in turn transforms from an abused, lonely and somewhat secluded child to a beautiful and caring woman.
* [[Ursula Le Guin]]'s protagonist from her ''[[A Wizard of Earthsea]]'' quartet gradually changes from an impulsive and arrogant youth to a stoic and wise man, reconciling the darkness within and all the bad actions it had caused.
* ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' series of books by [[George R.R. Martin]] shows numerous examples of complete character arcs. [[Daenerys Targaryen]] transforms from a naive young girl to a queen and a conqueror, only to fall from grace after a misuse of power. The character of [[Jon Snow (character)|Jon Snow]], undergoes a similar arc of embracing the need to govern and rule and metaphorically "kills the boy and lets the man be born" only to die after a misuse of power. Other characters such as [[Sansa Stark]] and [[Jaime Lannister]], start out as childish and petty, but once faced with the cruelty of the world, Jaime grows into a mature and wise leader, and Sansa grows into a strong-willed and poised lady.

=== In film ===
Some examples include:

* In ''[[Tootsie]]'', [[Dustin Hoffman]]'s character begins as a [[misogynist]]ic [[chauvinist]] but when he is forced to play the part of a woman, he also experiences a change in how he views women and becomes a different character by the end.
* In ''[[Empire of the Sun (film)|Empire of the Sun]]'', Jim begins as a carefree young boy.  After the Japanese take over [[Shanghai]] and he is separated from his family, he is forced to suffer trauma because of the war.
* In ''[[The Godfather]]'' (1972), widely regarded as one of the [[greatest films ever made]], Michael Corleone initially wants nothing to do with the crime business of his father, Don Vito Corleone. When Vito is critically injured in a shooting, however, Michael gradually becomes more involved in a war of retribution on those responsible. This, effectively and ironically, sets him down the path to becoming Don of the Corleone crime syndicate. Its acclaimed sequel, ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'' (1974), chronicles Michael's effective fall from grace as a result of becoming a powerful crime lord.
* In ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' (1976), Travis Bickle degenerates from a somewhat disturbed, highly disorganized Vietnam war veteran into an obsessive psychotic.
* In ''[[Goodfellas]]'' (1990), [[Henry Hill]] (played by [[Ray Liotta]]) goes from being a suave and sophisticated gangster to a paranoid nervous wreck due to a severe [[cocaine]] addiction.
* In ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]'', [[Elsa (Disney)|Elsa]] begins the movie embracing her ice powers. After injuring her sister  [[Anna (Disney)|Anna]] she becomes scared of her powers and considers herself a monster. After her sister sacrifices herself, Elsa finally embraces her powers again. Anna begins the movie as a social butterfly willing to throw herself into any man's arms. After [[Hans (Disney)|Hans]] betrays her, Anna learns that looks can sometimes be deceiving.
*In ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'', the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] begins a story arc dealing with accepting himself as one person rather than seeing Bruce Banner separate. It continues in ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' and will conclude in ''[[Untitled Avengers film|Avengers 4]]''.

=== In television ===
Like a [[story arc]], which often is composed of many [[dramatic structure|narrative arcs]], the character arc is not confined within the limits of one narrative.  The character arc may extend over to the next story, a [[sequel]], or another episode.  In episodic [[TV series]], the character arc functions as a [[narrative hook]] that writers often use to ensure viewers continue watching.

* The TV series ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'' made heavy use of character arcs throughout its run, with story arcs (or mysteries, as the show was famed for) normally being used to move the plot along in the background, as the four protagonists, [[Susan Mayer]], [[Lynette Scavo]], [[Bree Van de Kamp]], and [[Gabrielle Solis]], dealt with their various foibles and flaws, through the eyes of their dead friend and neighbour, [[Mary Alice Young]].
* Over the course of the television series ''[[Xena: Warrior Princess]]'' (first US air date: {{start date|1995|9}}), [[Gabrielle (Xena)|Gabrielle]] starts from a young, idealistic Greek farm girl to becoming a warrior, and in the end, she becomes [[Xena]]'s successor.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}
*''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'' focuses on character arcs for each of the survivors of a plane crash. [[Jack Shephard]] accepting his role as protector of the island, [[James "Sawyer" Ford]] going from a self-centered con-man to a mature leader, [[John Locke (Lost)|John Locke]]'' discovering his destiny on the island.

* ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'' (first US air date: {{start date|2001|10}}) focuses on character arcs for each of its main characters as they progress into their ''[[Superman]]'' comic book identities. [[Clark Kent]]'s arc revolved around the gradual acceptance of his destiny and becoming a hero. The series also tracks [[Lex Luthor]]'s progression into darkness and [[Lois Lane]]'s emulation of her cousin [[Chloe Sullivan|Chloe]] as she becomes a hardened journalist. Other characters have their eventual character arc alluded to but never explicitly defined or realized onscreen, such as [[Perry White]]'s rise to editor of the ''[[Daily Planet]]'' and [[Lex Luthor]]'s ascension to [[President of the United States]]. As well as individual characters, there are arcs involving many characters which intertwine to tell about the formation of the [[Justice League]].{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}
*In ''[[Breaking Bad]],'' [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter White]] begins as a high school chemistry teacher struggling with a serious illness while trying to support his family financially. His decision to become a manufacturer of addictive illegal drugs starts a downward spiral in which his wife, [[Skyler White]], divorces him, and his character ''arcs'' from a morally responsible regular guy into a dangerous monster.
* The teen drama series ''[[13 Reasons Why]]'' features two character arcs for its protagonist Clay Jensen: In the flashbacks, Clay begins as a shy young man until meeting [[Hannah Baker]]. In the present, after Hannah's death, he becomes emotionally withdrawn until listening to the tapes left behind by his former friend. After learning the truth, he becomes a warrior and a voice of justice for Hannah.

In the creation and criticism of fictional works, a '''character flaw''' is a limitation, imperfection, problem, [[phobia]], or deficiency present in a character who may be otherwise very functional. The flaw can be a problem that directly affects the character's actions and abilities, such as a violent temper. Alternatively, it can be a simple foible or personality defect, which affects the character's motives and social interactions, but little else.

Flaws can add depth and humanity to the characters in a [[narrative]].  For example, the sheriff with a gambling addiction, the [[action hero]] who is afraid of heights, or a lead in a [[romantic comedy]] who must overcome his insecurity regarding male pattern baldness are all characters whose flaws help provide dimension.  Perhaps the most widely cited and classic of character flaws is [[Achilles]]' famous heel.

In general, flaws can be categorized as ''minor'', ''major'', or ''tragic''.

==Minor flaw==
A minor character flaw is an imperfection which serves to distinguish the character in the mind of the reader / viewer / player / listener, making them memorable and individual, but otherwise does not affect the story in any way.

Examples of this could include a noticeable scar, a thick accent or a habit such as cracking their knuckles.

[[Protagonists]] and other major characters may (and usually do) have multiple minor flaws, making them more accessible, and enabling the reader / viewer / listener to relate to the character (in the case of a [[sympathetic character]]) or otherwise influence the audience's opinions of the character.

Many insignificant or archetypal characters which are encountered only once or rarely are defined solely by a single minor flaw, differentiating them from the [[stock character]] or [[archetype]] that they adhere to.

==Major flaw==
A major character flaw is a much more noticeable and important hindrance which actually impairs the individual, whether physically, mentally or morally. Sometimes major flaws are not actually negative per se (such as devout religious beliefs or a rigid code of honor), but are classified as such in that they often serve to hinder or restrict the character in some way.

Examples of this type of flaw could include blindness, [[amnesia]] or greed.

Unlike minor flaws, major flaws are almost invariably important to either the character's, or the story's development.

*For villains, their major flaw is usually the cause of their eventual downfall.
*For heroes, their major flaw usually must be overcome (either temporarily or permanently) at some point in the story, often at the climax, by their own determination or skill.
*For neutral characters, or those that shift allegiance, the major flaw is usually the cause of either their corruption, redemption or both.
*For the protagonist, the most visible flaw generally serves a more vital interest, as well, as it defines his or her core problem.  It is the protagonist's reluctant (and usually unconscious) journey to address this problem that forms the spine of the story, sometimes acting as the [[MacGuffin]] to stimulate the plot.

==Tragic/fatal flaw==
This is a specific sort of flaw, also known as "[[Hamartia]]", which is possessed by Aristotelian [[tragic hero]]s. It is a flaw which causes an otherwise noble or exceptional character to bring about their own downfall and, often, their eventual death.

Examples of this could include [[hubris]], misplaced trust, excessive curiosity, pride and lack of self-control.

This fall usually occurs at the beginning of a story, with the story itself concentrates on the consequences or attempted redemption of the fall.

== Examples ==

*[[Percy Jackson]] has a fatal flaw of excessive personal loyalty, while his girlfriend Annabeth Chase shares the flaw of the legendary Odysseus: hubris. (''[[Percy Jackson and the Olympians]]'')
*[[Jo March]]'s bluntness and hot temper cause conflict with her family. ''[[Little Women]]''
*In the ''[[Star Wars Expanded Universe|Star Wars Legends]]'' continuity, [[Jacen Solo|Jacen Solo's]] eventual downfall is linked to his placing the weight of the galaxy on his shoulder in his desire for peace.

===Film===
*In ''[[Rocky]]'', [[Rocky Balboa]] thinks of himself as a loser who cannot go the distance in the boxing ring.
*[[Anakin Skywalker]]'s anger and fear of losing his wife [[Padme Amidala|Padme]] eventually consumes him, leading to his transformation into [[Darth Vader]]. Whereas his mentor [[Obi-Wan Kenobi|Obi-Wan Kenobi's]] compassion and love for his student blinded him to the path Skywalker was taking. (''[[Star Wars]]'')
*In ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'', Rick thinks of himself as an unfeeling cynic who denies the pain and disappointment from a failed love affair with Ilsa.

*[[The Tenth Doctor]] is constantly trying to help and save the lives of others, and sometimes does things out of anger that have dire consequences later: ''[[Doctor Who]]''
*[[Mr. Gold|Rumplestiltskin's]] greatest character flaw was his greed, losing even those who love him over his mad desire for power. He shares this flaw with his former student and lover [[Cora Mills|Cora]]. (''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'') 
*[[Zelena (Once Upon a Time)|Zelena's]] envy of her younger half-sister [[Regina Mills]] eventually transformed her into the infamous [[Wicked Witch of the West]] as she planned to reverse time and supplant Regina. Even after this plan was thwarted, her envy remained a great character flaw throughout her time on the show. (''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'')
*After the death of her fiance Daniel Colter, [[Regina Mills|Regina]] suffered a mental breakdown and became consumed with anger, which Rumplestiltskin was able to use to shape her into the Evil Queen who would cast his Dark Curse. Anger, as a fatal flaw, is one she shares with [[Hook (Once Upon a Time)|Killian Jones]] whose own anger transformed him into vengeful [[Captain Hook]]; however, Hook did not share Regina's mental instability. (''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'')
*The main character flaw of the protagonist of the series, [[Emma Swan]], are her tendency to mistrust other people, which leads her to put up emotional barriers to protect herself and run when things get difficult.

===Gaming===
* In [[Warhammer 40,000]], the Primarch Lorgar Aurelian is extremely devout and reveres his "father", the Emperor of Mankind, as a god.

Hurt and depressed by the humiliation of his father's rebuke, Lorgar and the [[Space Marines (Warhammer 40,000)|Space Marines]] of the XVII Legion (the "Word Bearers") search for another purpose to sustain them, and in doing so become the first legion to fall under the malicious influence of [[Chaos (Warhammer)|Chaos]]. Their devotion to Chaos sees them instigate the devastating civil war known as the [[Horus Heresy (fictional event)|Horus Heresy]], the events of which led to the current dystopian setting of Warhammer 40,000.
*In ''[[Metal Gear Solid]]'', Liquid's jealousy of Solid Snake's "dominant genes" and his desire to be the better of the two sets much of the story in motion, leading to Liquid's eventual downfall.
*In the ''[[God of War (franchise)|God of War]]'' series, [[Kratos (God of War)|Kratos]] acts brutally and violently out of anger and desire for revenge, with devastating consequences on his only life and the world around him.

On 18 March 2013, [[Pope Francis]] adopted in his [[papal coat of arms]] the [[coat of arms]] and the [[motto]] that he used since his [[episcopal consecration]] in 1991, differenced following his election as [[Supreme Pontiff]].&lt;ref name="OR"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/francesco/elezione/stemma-papa-francesco_it.html | title=Lo Stemma di Papa Francesco | publisher=[[L'Osservatore Romano]] | date=March 18, 2013 | access-date=March 18, 2013 | language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charges and field==
His [[coat of arms]] displays three [[Charge (heraldry)|charges]] on a blue [[Field (heraldry)|field]]. In reference to Francis being a [[Jesuit]], the uppermost charge is the emblem of the [[Society of Jesus]].&lt;ref name="OR"/&gt; The emblem is composed of a  [[Sun (heraldry)|Sun radiant]], within which is the IHS [[christogram]] (a [[monogram]] of the [[Holy Name of Jesus]]) in red, with a red cross surmounting the H and three black nails below the H.&lt;ref name="OR"/&gt; 

Below the Jesuit emblem is an eight-pointed star, the [[Our Lady, Star of the Sea|star]] being  a long-standing symbol of the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]], and a [[spikenard]] representing [[Saint Joseph]].&lt;ref name="OR"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VIS"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.news.va/en/news/pope-francis-miserando-atque-eligendo | title=Pope Francis : "Miserando atque eligendo"... | publisher=[[Vatican Information Service]] | date=March 18, 2013 | accessdate=March 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= NCR/&gt; In [[Hispanic]] iconographic tradition Saint Joseph is often depicted with a branch of spikenard in his hand.&lt;ref name="OR2"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/francesco/elezione/stemma-papa-francesco_it.html | title=Lo Stemma di Papa Francesco | publisher=[[L'Osservatore Romano]] | date=March 18, 2013 | accessdate=4 December 2016 | language=Italian}} "La stella, secondo l’antica tradizione araldica, simboleggia la Vergine Maria, madre di Cristo e della Chiesa; mentre il fiore di nardo indica San Giuseppe, patrono della Chiesa universale. Nella tradizione iconografica ispanica, infatti, San Giuseppe è raffigurato con un ramo di nardo in mano."&lt;/ref&gt;

These charges appeared on Bergoglio's previous coat of arms displayed when he was [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Buenos Aires|Archbishop of Buenos Aires]],&lt;ref name= NCR&gt;{{cite news |title=Pope stresses simplicity, ecumenism in inaugural Mass plans |url= http://ncronline.org/blogs/ncr-today/pope-stresses-simplicity-ecumenism-inaugural-mass-plans|newspaper= [[National Catholic Reporter]] |date=18 March 2013 |accessdate=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but as Pope the [[tincture (heraldry)|tincture]] of the star and the spikenard were elevated from ''Argent'' (silver) to ''Or'' (gold). The first version of the [[Coats of arms of the Holy See and Vatican City|papal coat of arms]] published by the Vatican showed a five-pointed star from Bergoglio's previous one, but this was later amended to eight points; the representation of the spikenard was also slightly altered.

==Blazon==

The Vatican has not yet published the official [[blazon]] of the arms, but an approximation has been made by John Hamilton Gaylor, as follows:
:''Azure on a Sun in Splendour Or the IHS Christogram ensigned with a Cross paty fitchy piercing the H Gules all above three Nails fanwise points to centre Sable, and in dexter base a Mullet of eight points and in sinister base a Spikenard flower Or.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Wedvick of Jarlsby - Religious/Francis, H. H. Pope 3 |url=http://wedvickofjarlsby.org/webvick-gallery/displayimage.php?album=7&amp;pos=24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206134335/http://wedvickofjarlsby.org/webvick-gallery/displayimage.php?album=7&amp;pos=24 |archivedate=2013-12-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==External ornaments==
Traditionally, a [[Pope]]'s coat of arms was externally adorned only by the three-tiered [[Papal Tiara|papal tiara]] with lappets and the crossed keys of [[Saint Peter]] with a cord. The tiara represented the roles of authority of the Pope, while the keys represent the power to loose and bind in Heaven as on earth.&lt;ref&gt;({{bibleverse||Matt|16:19|63}})&lt;/ref&gt; Pope Francis' arms maintain the keys, but replaced the tiara (as did his predecessor) with a [[mitre|triband mitre]]. 

The [[Papal Tiara|tiara]] and keys remain the symbol of the [[papacy]] and appear on the [[coat of arms]] of the [[Holy See]] and (reversed) on the flag of [[Vatican City]].

===Mitre===
[[File:BANDERA GUARDIA VATICA PANCHO.svg|thumb|right|250px|[[Banner of the Pontifical Swiss Guard]] with Pope Francis' coat of arms]]
As with his [[Coat of arms of Pope Benedict XVI|predecessor's personal arms]], Francis replaced the traditional [[papal triregnum]] by adopting a [[tincture (heraldry)|silver]] [[mitre]] with three gold bands. These bands allude to the papal tiara's three [[crown (headgear)|crown]]s, which came to represent the three powers of Orders, Jurisdiction, and Magisterium, all joining at the centre depicting unity in the same person. Coincidentally, the three stripes and the vertical stripe in the center of the mitre also forms the Chinese character for “sovereign” (王).

===Motto===
[[File:Coat of arms of Jorge Mario Bergoglio.svg|thumb|Coat of arms as Cardinal Bergoglio]]
Unusually, Francis also decided to retain his personal [[motto]]: ''Miserando atque eligendo''. It is taken from the 21st [[homily]] of [[Bede|Saint Bede]], which is on the [[Gospel of Matthew]] and refers to the [[vocation]] of [[Saint Matthew]].&lt;ref name="OR"/&gt; He writes:

:"Vidit ergo Iesus publicanum et quia '''miserando atque eligendo''' vidit, ait illi 'Sequere me'." (Om. 21; CCL 122, 149-151)
:"Jesus saw the tax collector and, because '''he saw him through the eyes of mercy and chose him''', he said to him: Follow me." (trans. ''[[Liturgy of the Hours]]'' 1975, p. 1418)

Bede is here discussing Matthew 9:9-13. The salient point is that Jesus chose Matthew as his disciple not in spite but because of his being a sinner. In the Douay Rheims translation: 
&lt;ol start=9&gt;&lt;li&gt; And when Jesus passed on from hence, he saw a man sitting in the custom house, named Matthew; and he saith to him: Follow me. And he rose up and followed him.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; And it came to pass as he was sitting at meat in the house, behold many publicans and sinners came, and sat down with Jesus and his disciples.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; And the Pharisees seeing it, said to his disciples: Why doth your master eat with publicans and sinners?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; But Jesus hearing it, said: They that are in health need not a physician, but they that are ill.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Go then and learn what this meaneth, I will have mercy and not sacrifice. For I am not come to call the just, but sinners.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

The statement from the Vatican announcing the Pope's coat of arms and motto explained that the phrase had a special meaning for Francis as he felt it recalled his own vocation, when at the age of 17, he went to [[Sacrament of Penance (Catholic Church)|confession]] on St Matthew's day in 1953.&lt;ref name="OR"/&gt;

The '''coat of arms of the King of Spain''' is the [[heraldic symbol]] representing the monarch of Spain. The current version of the monarch's coat of arms was adopted in 2014 but is of much older origin. The arms marshal the arms of the former monarchs of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castille]], [[Kingdom of León|León]], [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]], and [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]].

Traditionally, coats of arms did not belong to a nation but to the monarch who would quarter his shield with territorial claims of his dynasty. Formerly, the Spanish monarch's arms were much more complex than they are today. It would feature the arms of the various territories of this dynasty. A simpler version of these arms, known as the ''lesser arms'', would also be used; This lesser arms were another set of arms within the centre of the full arms. During the later part of the Bourbon dynasty this would be quarterly Castille and Leon.

In 1868, during the [[Provisional Government (1868-1871)|provisional government]] that followed the overthrow of Queen [[Isabella II]], an arms of ''national character'' was adopted; This 1868 arms created the present-day arrangement of elements in the shield. The "national arms" and "royal arms" would coexist after the restoration of the monarchy. In 1931, the royal arms was revised to incorporate what had been hitherto the "national arms" into the royal arms and to replace the former lesser arms of the King (i.e. quarterly Castille and Leon). The monarchy would later be abolished later that year.

When don Juan Carlos, grandson of Alfonso XIII (the last king of Spain), was chosen to be the successor of General [[Francisco Franco]], the arms adopted for his use in 1971 as Prince of Spain was quarterly Castille, Leon, Aragon, and Navarre. The heraldic achievement also included the collar of the [[Order of the Golden Fleece]], the Cross of Burgundy and the yoke and bundle of arrows formerly used by the [[Catholic Monarchs]]; This would be the same arms he would use as King. Upon Felipe VI's ascension to the throne in 2014, the cross, yoke, and arrows would not be retained in the royal arms.

The shield is divided into four quarters, blazoned as follows:

*1st, [[gules]] a castle [[Or (heraldry)|or]], triple-embattled and voided gate and windows, with three towers each triple-turreted, of the field, masoned [[sable]] and ajoure [[azure (heraldry)|azure]], which is for [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]];
*2nd, [[argent]] a lion [[rampant]] purpure crowned or, langued and armed, of the second, which is for [[Kingdom of León|León]];
*3rd, or, four pallets gules, which is for [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]];
*4th, gules a cross, saltire and orle of chains linked together or, a centre point vert, which is for [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]];

Inescutcheon [[azure (heraldry)|azure]] [[bordure]] gules, three [[fleurs-de-lys]] or, which is for [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon-Anjou]].

All surrounded by the collar of the [[Order of the Golden Fleece|Golden Fleece]] and crowned with a crown of the same metal and precious stones, with eight rosettes, five visible, and eight pearls interspersed, closed at the top by eight diadems also adorned with pearls and surmounted by a cross on a globe, which is the royal crown of Spain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casareal.es/sm_rey/armas-iden-idweb.html Coat of arms of His Majesty the King of Spain]. The Royal Household of the King of Spain. Retrieved 19 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, General [[Francisco Franco]] appointed [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Juan Carlos I]] as his "successor to the Headship of the Spanish state with the title of King" but gave him the new title of [[Prince of Spain]] instead of the traditional title of [[Prince of Asturias]]. From 1971 to 1975, Juan Carlos as Prince of Spain used a coat of arms which was virtually identical to the one later adopted when he became King in 1975. Earlier coat of arms differed only that it featured the royal crown of a Crown Prince of Spain, the King's royal crown has eight half-arches of which five are visible, while the Prince's one has only four half-arches of which three are visible.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.armada.mde.es/ArmadaPortal/page/Portal/ArmadaEspannola/conocenos_historia/03_bandera_armada--14_miscelania--02_insignias_jefes_estado--05_juan_carlos_i_es ''Spanish Decree 814 of 22nd April 1971'']. Boletín Oficial del Estado, Official Gazette of the Spanish Government, no. 99. Retrieved 19 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Joined to the shield was the red saltire of [[Cross of Burgundy Flag|Burgundy]] and, to the dexter and sinister of the base point, the yoke gules in its natural position with ribbons, of the field, and the sheaf of five arrows gules with the arrowheads inverted and ribbons, of the field, which used to be the symbol of the [[Catholic Monarchs]] of Spain.

Since June 2014, Juan Carlos's son, Felipe VI, has been using the same arms but without the cross of Burgundy, yoke and arrows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.casareal.es/EN/FamiliaReal/rey/Paginas/rey_armas.aspx |title=Coat of arms of His Majesty King Juan Carlos |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= 2014-06-19|website=Spanish Royal Household Website |publisher= |accessdate=2014-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; King Juan Carlos's arms include a red lion instead of the purple one displayed on the current version&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.casareal.es/EN/FamiliaReal/ReyFelipe/Paginas/principe_armas.aspx |language= |title= Coat of arms of His Majesty the King|last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= 2014-06-19|website=Spanish Royal Household Website |publisher= |accessdate=2014-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most prominent of them was [[Gong Xian]]. The Eight Masters of Nanjing were:&lt;ref name="Barnhart266"/&gt;

* [[Gong Xian]] (ca. 1618-1689)
* [[Fan Qi (artist)|Fan Qi]] (1615/1616-ca. 1694)
* [[Ye Xin]] ([[floruit|fl.]] 1650-1670s)
* [[Zou Zhe]] (1636-ca. 1708)
* [[Gao Cen]] (fl. 1670s; d. 1689)
* [[Hu Zao]] (fl. 1681)
* [[Wu Hong]] (fl. 1670s-1680s)
* [[Xie Sun]] (fl. 1679)

==Name==

"[[Jinling]]" was a former name of the city of [[Nanjing]]. In [[Chinese language|Chinese]], the terms 金陵八家 and 南京八家 are both used, though the former ("Eight Masters of Jinling") is more frequently used than the latter ("Eight Masters of Nanjing"). In [[English language|English]], on the other hand, the term "Eight Masters of Nanjing" is more frequently used than the term "Eight Masters of Jinling".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25993">[[File:Facebook_-_Update_Your_Name_notification.jpg|thumb|right|[[Facebook]]'s [[Facebook features#Notification|notification]] to "update your name"]]

The '''Facebook real-name policy controversy''' refers to the controversy over [[Social networking service|social networking]] site [[Facebook]]{{'}}s "[[real-name system]]" dictating how people register their accounts and configure their [[user profile]]s.  The controversy stems from a policy that those who have been adversely affected describe as penalizing users who are in fact using their real names which Facebook has nevertheless deemed to be "fake", while simultaneously allowing anyone to create fake yet plausible-sounding names, as well as obviously implausible-sounding names comprising word combinations that Facebook's software fails to recognize as unlikely to be real because their alleged nonstandard spelling or confusion with fictional characters. Facebook furthermore prohibits users from accurately representing names which according to the site have "too many words", and prohibits initializing first names, preventing users who do so in real life from formatting their own names as they see fit.

== Background ==
The social networking website [[Facebook]] has maintained the [[real-name system]] policy for user profiles.  According to Facebook, the real-name policy stems from the position "that way, you always know who you're connecting with. This helps keep our community safe."&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/16/living/facebook-name-policy/ |title=Facebook 'real name' policy stirs questions around identity |last=Grinberg |first=Emanuella |date=September 18, 2014 |publisher=[[CNN]] |accessdate=October 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Facebook"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/help/112146705538576|title=What names are allowed on Facebook?|last=|first=|date=|publisher=[[Facebook]] |accessdate=October 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise per this policy, a "real name" is defined by "your real name as it would be listed on your credit card, driver's license or student ID."&lt;ref name="Business Insider"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-apologizes-for-real-name-policy-2014-10|title=Facebook Apologizes For 'Real Name' Policy That Forced Drag Queens To Change Their Profiles|last=Levy|first=Karyne|date=October 1, 2014|work=[[Business Insider]] |accessdate=October 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2012, Facebook estimated that more than 83&amp;nbsp;million Facebook accounts are fake accounts.&lt;ref name="usa"&gt;{{cite news |title=Facebook: About 83 million accounts are fake |work=[[USA Today]] |url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/story/2012-08-03/cnbc-facebook-fake-accounts/56759964/1 |accessdate=August 4, 2012 |date=August 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this revelation, the share price of Facebook dropped below $20.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Facebook share price slumps below $20 amid fake account flap |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/aug/02/facebook-share-price-slumps-20-dollars |accessdate=August 4, 2012 |location=London |first=Dominic |last=Rushe |date=August 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facebook has asserted that "authentic identity is important to the Facebook experience, and our goal is that every account on Facebook should represent a real person."&lt;ref name="usa" /&gt;

==Affected users==

===Ethnic groups===

====Native Americans====
[[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] have been repeatedly targeted due to Facebook's policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Holpuck|first1=Amanda|title=Facebook still suspending Native Americans over 'real name' policy|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/16/facebook-real-name-policy-suspends-native-americans|accessdate=6 March 2015|publisher=Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Robin Kills The Enemy, a resident of the [[Sioux]] Rosebud reservation in South Dakota, found that when she tried to register her surname in its normal format, the site would not let her use them, so she resorted to combining the three words, spelling them as one word.  After having been a member for some time, she eventually contacted the site in an attempt to have her surname spelled as it actually is in real life.  However, after reaching out to Facebook, they instead deactivated her account without explanation.  When she was finally able to make contact with an actual employee, they wrote back telling her "Fake names are a violation of our Terms of Use. Facebook requires users to provide their full first and last names".  She eventually managed to have her account reinstated; however, users with the surname Kills The Enemy are, as of 2015, still required by Facebook to spell their surname without spaces as a single word.&lt;ref name=ictmn&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ramos|first1=Nestor|title=Facebook no friend to American Indian names |url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2009/02/16/facebook-no-friend-american-indian-names-82895|website=Indian Country Today media network}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Shane Creepingbear, an Oklahoman member of the [[Kiowa]] tribe, reported that he had been "kicked off" of Facebook on [[Columbus Day]] for having a supposedly fake name.&lt;ref name=metroCreepingbear&gt;{{cite web|last1=McAteer|first1=Ollie|title=Native Americans booted off Facebook for having ‘fake’ names like Creepingbear|url=http://metro.co.uk/2015/02/11/native-americans-booted-off-facebook-for-having-fake-names-like-creepingbear-5057955/|website=Metro}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Lance Brown Eyes, an [[Oglala Lakota|Oglala]], found that his account had been suspended; when he was able to send in documentation to Facebook proving his identity, Facebook reinstated his account, but changed his name to "Lance Brown".&lt;ref name=IBT&gt;{{cite web|last1=Russon|first1=Mary-Ann|title=Facebook fail: Native Americans keep being accused of using fake names|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/facebook-fail-native-americans-keep-being-accused-using-fake-names-1487378|website=International Business Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Dana Lone Hill, a member of the [[Lakota people|Lakota]] tribe who had been a registered Facebook user for several years, discovered one day that she had been locked out of her account.  A message from Facebook said "it looks like the name on your Facebook account may not be your authentic name".  After a week, during which she had to send in her personal documentation to Facebook, her account access was restored.  She has since threatened a class-action lawsuit on behalf of Native Americans against Facebook due to how it exercises its name policies.

A number of Native Americans have objected to Facebook's inquiries into their names, and to Facebook's request that they provide proof of identification or other documentation in order to use the service.&lt;ref name="The Washington Post"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Phillip| first1=Abby| title=Online ‘authenticity’ and how Facebook's ‘real name’ policy hurts Native Americans | date=October 2, 2014|accessdate=October 5, 2015|url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/02/10/online-authenticity-and-how-facebooks-real-name-policy-hurts-native-americans/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Native American activists claimed to be planning to file a [[class action lawsuit]] against Facebook regarding the 'real name' policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Holpuck|first1=Amanda|title=Native American activist to sue Facebook over site's 'real name' policy|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/19/native-american-activist-facebook-lawsuit-real-name|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|work=The Guardian|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Japanese====
In 2008, a woman in Japan named Hiroko Yoda had her Facebook account suspended over her [[Yoda_(disambiguation)|surname]], which is common in Japan, being confused with a [[Star Wars]] character of the [[Yoda|same name]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/2632170/Woman-called-Yoda-blocked-from-Facebook.html|title=Woman called Yoda blocked from Facebook|first=Matthew|last=Moore|date=27 August 2008|publisher=|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Irish====
The [[Dublin]] branch of the [[Irish language]] rights group, Misneach, started a [[Change.org]] [[online petition]] to demand the right to use Irish names on Facebook and protested outside Facebook's European headquarters in Dublin on October 7, 2015.&lt;ref name="Irish Times"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/protest-at-dublin-facebook-hq-over-real-name-policy-1.2345414 |title=Protest at Dublin Facebook HQ over ‘real-name’ policy |last=Tracer |first=Dan |date=September 9, 2015 |work=[[Irish Times]] |accessdate=September 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scottish Gaelic====
In 2015, one Gaelic-speaking retired policeman won the right to use his Gaelic name on Facebook, even though it was not his legal name. Some Scottish Gaelic surnames, such as NicIllAnndrais, contain more than two capital letters and are still disallowed by Facebook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Man wins Facebook battle over ‘fake’ Gaelic name|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/odd/man-wins-facebook-battle-over-fake-gaelic-name-1-3702815|date=26 February 2015|website=www.scotsman.com|accessdate=31 October 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chamoru====
In the Spanish-influenced indigenous [[Chamoru]] culture of the [[Marianas]], the standard naming convention has historically been for a person to use their mother's [[maiden name]] as their middle name. (Chamoru culture, having been colonized by Spain, went through a period where indigenous names and naming conventions were forcibly eradicated and replaced by what the conquering Spanish deemed acceptable.) Furthermore, using one's full name rather than simply the first and last is commonplace, if only for disambiguation purposes due to a relatively small pool of surnames. Therefore, middle names such as De Leon Guerrero and De La Cruz are frequently encountered. However, attempting to register such names as one's middle name results in a message telling users that "Names can't have too many words." Therefore, many Chamoru users are forced to either run all of the words together as if they were one single word, or to initialize each word to a common acronym such as DLG or DLC.

In cases where the acronym is employed, Facebook automatically changes to lower-case all letters except the first. (Use of periods, e.g. D.L.G., will result in a message telling users that "Profile names can't have too many periods.") Therefore, someone commonly known in real life by a name such as Mary De Leon Guerrero Mafnas would have to resort to using what on Facebook would end up being "Mary Dlg Mafnas". The message is not accompanied by an option to challenge/appeal the restriction or to send Facebook documentation that the format is how one normally formats their name in real life.

====Vietnamese====
In January 2015, a 23-year-old Australian bank employee claiming to be named Phuc Dat Bich posted a photo of his passport identification page to Facebook, protesting that the company had unfairly shut down his account for being "false and misleading".&lt;ref name=BBCBich&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-34897404|title=Phuc Dat Bich: Australian with 'misleading' name thanks supporters|date=November 23, 2015|accessdate=November 23, 2015|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Is it because I'm Asian? Is it?" he asked. The BBC reported that in Vietnamese the name is pronounced similarly to "Phoo Da Bi" (IPA: [[Help:IPA/Vietnamese|{{ipa|/fukp˦˥ ɗat˩ ɓic˦˥/}}]]).&lt;ref name=BBCBich/&gt; After his reinstatement, Bich posted a thank you note to supportive Facebook fans, stating he was "glad and honoured to be able to make people happy by simply making them laugh at something that appears outrageous and ridiculous".&lt;ref name=BBCBich/&gt; Subsequently "Phuc Dat" published a further message admitting it was a hoax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Phuc Dat Bich admits hoax in Facebook name battle|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-34918491|accessdate=25 November 2015|publisher=BBC|date=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tamils====
Tamils do not have surnames: They have their father or mother or both father and mother's first name as initials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://bumpahead.net/tamil-name-structure-10dd63730563|title=Tamil name structure… |author=moulee|date=19 July 2009|publisher=bumpahead.net|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This standard naming practice has not been acknowledged by Facebook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/facebook-should-scrap-its-regressive-real-names-policy/article7797302.ece|title=Really harassed by Facebook’s ‘real names’|author=G. Sampath|date=24 October 2015|publisher=The Hindu|accessdate=15 April 2018|via=www.thehindu.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transgender users===
Facebook's real-name policy does not reflect adopted names or [[pseudonym]]s used by the [[transgender]] community, and has led to suspending users with real names that might be thought to be fake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=Associated Press| url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2009-05-25/business/20872135_1_accounts-with-fake-names-facebook-facebook-guidelines-and-features|work=The San Francisco Chronicle|first=Barbara|last=Ortutay|date=May 25, 2009|title=Real users caught in Facebook fake-name purge|accessdate=October 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A user via the anonymous [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]] app [[Secret (app)|Secret]] began reporting "fake names" which caused user profiles to be suspended, specifically targeting the [[stage name]]s of [[drag queen]]s.&lt;ref name="Business Insider"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Holpuck|first1=Amanda|title=Facebook still freezing accounts despite apology to drag queens over 'real names.'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/17/facebook-still-freezing-accounts-despite-apology-drag-queens-real-names|accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transgender people have also been affected by the policy, including one former Facebook employee who initiated development on Facebook's custom gender options, who was suspended on the day the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ruled in ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]'' that same-sex marriage bans were unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://medium.com/@zip/my-name-is-only-real-enough-to-work-at-facebook-not-to-use-on-the-site-c37daf3f4b03|title=My name is only real enough to work at Facebook, not use on the site|publisher=[[Medium.com]]|author=Zip|date=June 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2015/06/28/woman-responsible-for-facebook-gender-options-kicked-off-for-violating-real-names-policy/|title=Woman responsible for Facebook gender options kicked off for violating real names policy|date=June 28, 2015|first=Naith|last=Payton|publisher=[[Pink News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to gender non-conforming activist D. Dragonetti, Facebook even disregarded their government identification when supplied.{{Better source|date=March 2015|reason=Daily Dot.  This is an opinion piece.  Author admits the article is about his/her personal experience, and it may or may not be completely factual or verifiable}}&lt;ref name="Daily Dot"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dragonetti| first1=D.| title=Is Facebook easing up on its 'real names' policy—or cracking down? | work=[[The Daily Dot]]|date=October 20, 2014|accessdate=October 23, 2014|url= http://www.dailydot.com/opinion/facebook-real-names-cracking-down-transgender/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 1, 2014, [[Chris Cox (Facebook)|Chris Cox]], Chief Product Officer at Facebook, offered an apology to the LGBT community and drag kings and queens: &lt;blockquote&gt;In the two weeks since the real-name policy issues surfaced, we've had the chance to hear from many of you in these communities and understand the policy more clearly as you experience it. We've also come to understand how painful this has been. We owe you a better service and a better experience using Facebook, and we're going to fix the way this policy gets handled so everyone affected here can go back to using Facebook as you were.&lt;ref name="chriscoxpost"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/chris.cox/posts/10101301777354543|title=Chris Cox - I want to apologize to the affected community of drag...|last=Cox|first=Chris|date=October 1, 2014|publisher=[[Facebook]] |accessdate=October 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Users target of religious persecution ===
Secular, atheist, agnostic, humanist, or users who comment or blog expressing views critical of particular religions, sects or religion in general, as well as religious people who express the opposing views critical of atheism or agnosticism very often have a legitimate need to use an alias. Some of these users could suffer rejection, retaliation or violence if their views – contrary to those of their family, friends or community – are known. In some cases, secular bloggers are exposed to imprisonment by an intolerant government, violent attacks in the street or even being killed by religious fanatics. Examples are the incarceration of activist and blogger [[Raif Badawi]] in Saudi Arabia and a string of attacks and murders of secular activists in [[Attacks by Islamic extremists in Bangladesh|Bangladesh]] or Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/abdullah-sharif/pakistans-religious-extremism_b_9577338.html|title=Pakistan's Religious Extremism: A World Menace|first=Abdullah|last=Sharif|date=1 April 2016|website=huffingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reaction ==
International non-profit [[digital rights]] group [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] stated they were "alarmed to hear that Facebook's 'real name' policy is disproportionately affecting the LGBTQ community."&lt;ref name="EFF"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/09/facebooks-real-name-policy-can-cause-real-world-harm-lgbtq-community |title=Facebook's 'Real Name' Policy Can Cause Real-World Harm for the LGBTQ Community |last1=Kayyali |last2=York |first1=Nadia |first2=Jillian |date=September 16, 2014 |publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] |accessdate=October 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Online magazine]] ''[[Queerty]]'' called Facebook's policy "a frankly creepy overreach of authority", adding "There are a million reasons why someone would choose to self-identify with a name other than the one that's printed on their birth certificate. And really, it's absolutely none of your business in the first place."&lt;ref name="Queerty"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.queerty.com/facebook-targeting-drag-queens-forcing-them-to-use-their-legal-names-20140911 |title=Facebook Targeting Drag Queens, Forcing Them To Use Their Legal Names |last=Tracer |first=Dan |date=September 11, 2014 |work=[[Queerty]] |accessdate=October 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview for MAGE Magazine, Second Life entrepreneur Jennifer Ceara Firehawk stated: "If we are not using our page to abuse or grief others they just need to leave us be. We are not hurting anyone…  FB does not realize some SL people earn lindens to turn into RL (real life) money and that is how they make a living. Once you force a person to change the SL name they will lose money due to not being able to find them on FB or SL as they may use FB for their buisness [sic] or advertise. So they end up losing buisness [sic] and money."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://0zymandius.wix.com/magemagazine#!September-18-The-Day-F-Book-killed-the-King-Part-1/c112t/55fc2bae0cf256c0bf936f60|title=The Day F Book killed the King : Part 1|date=September 18, 2015|first=Ian|last=Thomson|magazine=MAGE Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Seattle]] [[Drag (clothing)|drag performer]] Olivia LaGarce started a [[Change.org]] [[online petition]] titled "Allow performers to use their stage names on their Facebook accounts!"&lt;ref name="BBC News"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Stranger"/&gt;

== Compromise to protect those with special circumstances  ==
On December 15, 2015, Facebook announced in a press release&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsroom.fb.com/news/2015/12/community-support-fyi-improving-the-names-process-on-facebook/|title=Community Support FYI: Improving the Names Process on Facebook |last1=Osofsky |first1=Jason |last2=Gage |first2=Todd |date=December 15, 2015 |website=Facebook Newsroom |publisher=Facebook |access-date=December 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; that it would be providing a compromise to its real name policy after protests from groups such as the gay/lesbian community and abuse victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/facebook-modifies-real-names-policy-testing-use-of-assumed-names-1.2702400 |title=Facebook modifies 'real names' policy, testing use of assumed names |last=AFP |date=December 16, 2015 |website=CTV News |publisher=Bell Media |access-date=December 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site is developing a protocol that will allow members to provide specifics as to their "special circumstance" or "unique situation" with a request to use pseudonyms, subject to verification of their true identities. At that time, this was already being tested in the U.S. Product manager Todd Gage and vice president of global operations Justin Osofsky also promised a new method for reducing the number of members who must go through ID verification while ensuring the safety of others on Facebook. The fake name reporting procedure will also be modified, forcing anyone who makes such an allegation to provide specifics that would be investigated and giving the accused individual time to dispute the allegation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/15/facebook-change-controversial-real-name-policy?subid=17310058&amp;CMP=EMCNEWEML6619I2 |title=Facebook changes controversial 'real name' policy in wake of criticism  |last1=Holpuch |first1=Amanda |date=December 15, 2015 |website=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited |access-date=December 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This measure was criticised by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, who pointed out that it forces the most vulnerable users to reveal intimate details of their personal lives. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/12/changes-facebooks-real-names-policy-still-dont-fix-problem|title=Changes to Facebook’s "Real Names" Policy Still Don’t Fix the Problem}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, as of January 2018, there is no evidence in Facebook's policies that this measure was ever implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/help/229715077154790?helpref=related|title=What other names are allowed on Facebook?|publisher=Facebook|access-date=May 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ferdinand Ashmall''' (9 January 1695 &amp;ndash; 2 February 1798) was an English [[centenarian]] and [[Catholic priest]] for the [[Catholic Church in England and Wales]].&lt;ref name=demo/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.grg.org/Adams/OldestCentYear.HTM | title=Oldest Validated Centenarian By Year |publisher=[[Gerontology Research Group]] |date=September 25, 2007 |accessdate=October 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;He is not to be confused with his uncle, for whom he is named after.

The '''flags of the Dutch royal family''' are a set of flags used to identify a member of the royal family. The current system of flags for the Dutch monarch, princes, and princesses was introduced in 1908.

== Background ==
The current system of personal flags for the monarch and other members of the royal family was introduced in 1908. In 1907, minor modifications were introduced to the Dutch coat of arms; likewise, a new flag for the Dutch monarch was introduced the following year. These flags are designed by the High Council of Nobility (who are also responsible for heraldry of the royal family) and are granted by royal decree. Like their coats of arms, these flags are usually shared among siblings.

The flags follow a similar pattern and, although not [[banner of arms|banners of arms]], are heavily influenced by heraldry. Flags of those born into the royal family feature a Nassau-blue cross on an orange field, while the colours are reversed for those who marry into the family. Males have near-square flags while those of females are swallowtailed. Elements of an individual's family coat of arms are also incorporated into the flags.

== Use ==
The flags are used to mark the presence of an individual in certain buildings, when on vehicles (e.g. a car or ship), or in an army unit. The flag of the monarch is flown above [[Huis ten Bosch Palace]] in [[The Hague]] (the king's private residence) and above [[Noordeinde Palace]] in The Hague (the king's official residence) when the monarch is in the Netherlands, but not necessarily when he is actually resident. Besides these two residences, the royal standard is flown above other palaces, castles or estates where and when the King is actually staying.

The flags are never flown at half-mast; during a period of mourning, a black [[pennon]] is affixed to the flagpole flying the flag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Personal flags|url=https://www.royal-house.nl/topics/flags/personal-flags|website=www.royal-house.nl|accessdate=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Royal standard ==
The '''royal flag''' ({{lang-nl|koninklijke vlag}}), or the '''royal standard''' of the [[Netherlands]], is the official flag of the [[Monarchy of the Netherlands|Dutch monarch]]. This flag is a non-personal distinctive flag and is not changed from reign to reign. The current flag, introduced in 1908, is a square [[orange (colour)|orange]] flag, divided in four quarters by a nassau-blue [[cross]]. These colours refer to the principality of [[Principality of Orange|Orange]] (in [[France]]) and the principality of [[Duchy of Nassau|Nassau]] (in [[Germany]]) from which the present royal family originates. 

In the centre of the flag is the lesser [[Coat of arms of the Netherlands|coat of arms of the Kingdom]] (which originates as a composite of features taken from the arms of the [[house of Nassau]] and the [[Dutch Republic Lion|arms of the Dutch republic]]) surmounted by a [[Crown (headgear)|royal crown]] and surrounded by the insignia of the Grand Cross of the [[Military William Order]]. Each quarter shows a bugle-horn which originates in arms of the principality of Orange.

Image:Arms of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.svg| [[Coat of arms of the Netherlands|Netherlands]]
&lt;/gallery&gt;

Upon the accession of King [[Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands|Willem-Alexander]] in 2013, the monarch's flag was slightly modified: Instead of a rosette, a bow is placed in the ribbon of the Military William Order. Furthermore, the tassels on the horns now both hang down. The adjustments were applied on 30 April 2013 immediately after Willem-Alexander taking office.

==Princes==
The flag of a Dutch prince is rectangular in shape and of proportions 5:6. Flags of princes born into the royal family consist of a Nassau-blue cross on an orange field. 

Instead of the hunting horn of Orange in the upper right and the lower left quarters found in the monarch's flag, these are replaced with figures obtained from the coat of arms of the family of the prince's parent who married into the royal family. 

Unlike the monarch's flag, the coat of arms of the kingdom is not surrounded by the insignia of the Great Cross of the Military Order of Guillaume, but is placed within an orange circle which replaces the center of the cross.

The flag of a Dutch princess is [[Swallowtail (flag)|swallowtail]]ed in shape and of proportions 5:6. Flags of princesses born into the royal family consist of a Nassau-blue cross on an orange field while the flags of princesses by marriage are reversed. 

Unlike the flags for princes, the right side of the flag is devoid of the hunting horn of Orange and personal figure. However, the left portion of a princesse's flag contains the usual hunting horn of Orange and personal figure (obtained from the coat of arms of the family of the princess's parent who married into the royal family) in the upper and lower left quarters of the flag respectively.

Unlike the monarch's flag, the coat of arms of the kingdom is not surrounded by the insignia of the Great Cross of the Military Order of Guillaume, but is placed either within an orange circle which replaces the center of a blue cross, or at the centre of an orange cross.

|-

==Consorts==
In general, the standard of a prince consort of the Netherlands is a rectangular flag with proportions 5:6 with the colours of the royal standard (i.e. the orange field and blue cross) reversed. The upper left and lower right quarters bear the lion from the Dutch coat of arms (holding arrows in one hand and brandishing a sword on the other) while the other two quarters have a personal figure taken from their personal coat of arms.

In general, the standard of a queen consort, or the wife of a prince of the Netherlands, is a flag in the form of a swallow tail. The two right quarters are empty, the upper left corner bears the orange horn taken from the arms of the Principality of Orange and the lower left quarter has a personal figure, taken from their personal coat of arms.

In both cases, the coat of arms of the kingdom is at the center of the cross.

The '''Forgotten Ten''' ({{lang-ga|An Deichniúr Dearmadta}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wn.com/the_forgotten_ten__an_deichni%C3%BAr_dearmadta_part_1|title=The Forgotten Ten An Deichniúr Dearmadta Part 1|work=World News|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the term applied to ten members of the [[Irish Republican Army]] who were executed in [[Mountjoy Prison]], [[Dublin]] by British forces following [[court martial|courts martial]] from 1920–21 during the [[Irish War of Independence]].

Based upon military law at the time, they were buried within the prison precincts, their graves unmarked in the [[Consecration|unconsecrated ground]].

==Campaign for reburial==
Following the [[Irish War of Independence]], Mountjoy Prison was transferred to the control of the [[Irish Free State]], which became the State of [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] in 1937. In the 1920s, the families of the dead men requested their remains be returned to them for proper burial. This effort was joined in the later 1920s by the [[National Graves Association]].  Through the efforts of the Association, the graves of the men were identified in 1934, and in 1996 a [[Celtic cross]] was erected in [[Glasnevin Cemetery]] to commemorate them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.ie/history.htm Source 1. above] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071120173433/http://www.nga.ie/history.htm |date=November 20, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==State funeral==
[[Image:The Forgotten Ten.jpg|thumb|The grave of nine of the Forgotten Ten in Glasnevin Cemetery, Dublin]]
The campaign to rebury the men dragged on for 80 years from their deaths. Following an intense period of negotiations, the Irish government relented. Plans to exhume the bodies of the 10 men were announced on 1 November 2000, the 80th anniversary of the execution of Kevin Barry. On 14 October 2001, the Forgotten Ten were afforded full state honours, with a private service at Mountjoy Prison for the families of the dead, a [[requiem mass]] at [[St Mary's Pro-Cathedral]] and burial in [[Glasnevin Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'', 15 October 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[The Guardian]]'', some criticised the event as glorifying militant [[Irish republicanism]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/oct/15/northernireland.ireland Dublin State Funeral for IRA Men], Guardian.co.uk; accessed 1 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; It coincided with the [[Fianna Fáil]] [[Ardfheis|party conference]].&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/oct/15/northernireland.ireland|title=Dublin state funeral for IRA men|author=Rosie Cowan|work=the Guardian|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The progress of the cortège through the centre of Dublin was witnessed by crowds estimated as being in the tens of thousands who broke into spontaneous applause as the coffins passed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ireland/1359518/Ahern-defends-1921-IRA-men's-state-funeral.html Ahern defends 1921 IRA men's state funeral ] 14 Oct 2001 Telegraph.co.uk : Accessed 1 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; On [[O'Connell Street]], a lone piper played a lament as the cortege paused outside the [[General Post Office (Dublin)|General Post Office]], the focal point of the 1916 [[Easter Rising]].&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt; In his homily during the requiem mass, [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Cahal Daly]], a long-time critic of [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|the IRA campaign]] in [[Northern Ireland]], insisted that there was a clear distinction between the conflict of 1916–22 and the paramilitary-led violence of the previous 30 years:

{{quote|
The true inheritors today of the ideals of the men and women of 1916 to 1922 are those who are explicitly and visibly committed to leaving the physical force tradition behind... Surely this state funeral can be an occasion for examination of conscience about the ideals of the men who died, and about our responsibility for translating those ideals into today's realities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D06EFDD113FF936A25753C1A9679C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all Irish Rebury 10 Republicans Hanged by British in 1920s], New York Times; accessed 1 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In his graveside oration the [[Taoiseach]] [[Bertie Ahern]] echoed these sentiments and also paid tribute to the Ten:{{quote|These 10 young men were executed during the War of Independence. The country was under tremendous pressure at the time. There was a united effort. Meanwhile, elected by the people, Dáil Éireann was developing, in spite of a war going on.

== Outline of story ==
[[File:25 tam back.jpg|thumb| Backside of Tibetan [[Historical money of Tibet|25 tam banknote]], dated 1659 of the Tibetan Era (= 1913 CE). On the right, the four harmonious animals are represented.]]
A popular scene often found as wall paintings in Tibetan religious buildings represents an elephant standing under a fruit tree carrying a monkey, a hare and a bird (usually a partridge, but sometimes a grouse, and in Bhutan a [[hornbill]]) on top of each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gruschke|first1=Andreas|title=The Cultural Monuments of Tibet's Outer Provinces: The Qinghai part of Amdo|date=2001|publisher=White Lotus Press|location=Bangkok|isbn=9747534592|page=243|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GuKfAAAAMAAJ|series=The Cultural Monuments of Tibet's Outer Provinces: Amdo|volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scene refers to a legend which tells that four animals were trying to find out who was the oldest. The elephant said that the tree was already fully grown when he was young, the monkey that the tree was small when he was young, the hare that he saw the tree as a sapling when he was young and the bird claimed that he had excreted the seed from which the tree grew. So the bird was recognized by the other animals as the oldest, and the four animals lived together in co-dependence and cooperation, helping each other to enjoy the fruits of the tree. After the story is finished, it is revealed the partridge was the Buddha in a previous life.&lt;ref name="Chalmers 1895"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/j1/j1040.htm|title=The Jataka|volume=I|first=Robert|last=Chalmers|author-link=Robert Chalmers, 1st Baron Chalmers|year=1895|chapter=Tittira Jātaka}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Beer 2003" /&gt;{{rp|51}} The story was meant as an illustration of cooperation and respect for seniority, and was told by the Buddha after some of his students had failed to pay due respect to the senior disciple [[Śāriputra]].&lt;ref name="Whitecross 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Richard|first1=Whitecross,|title="Virtuous Beings": The Concept of ''tha damtshig'' and Being a Moral Person in Contemporary Bhutanese Society|journal=Himalaya, the Journal of the Association for Nepal and Himalayan Studies|date=1 January 2010|volume=28|issue=1|url=http://digitalcommons.macalester.edu/himalaya/vol28/iss1/6/|language=en|issn=2471-3716|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Malalasekera 1938"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Tittira Jātaka (No.37)|encyclopedia=Dictionary of Pāli Proper Names|author-link=G P Malalasekera|first=G.P.|last=Malalasekera|volume=2|url=http://palikanon.com/english/pali_names/t/tittira_j_37_117_319_438.htm|year=1938|publisher=[[Pali Text Society]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the tale also describes the animals upholding the [[five precepts]] and teaching them to others.&lt;ref name="Penjore 2005" /&gt; One of the oldest extant forms of the story is the [[Pali]] version, called the ''Tittira Jataka''.&lt;ref name="Beer 2003" /&gt;{{rp|51}}

== Themes ==
[[File:FourHarmoniousAnimalsROI.jpg|thumb|Wall painting, [[Sikkim]]|left|upright=0.5]]
Communal harmony and respect for seniority are the main moral of the story. Such respect stands in contrast with a [[pecking-order]] according to strength, size and power: it is {{em|the partridge}} which is most respected, not the elephant.&lt;ref name="Penjore 2005"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Penjore|first1=Ugyen|title=Understanding the symbolism of Thuenpa Puen Zhi|url=http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=40,1531,0,0,1,0#.WI0s0FUrK70|via=The Buddhist Channel|accessdate=28 January 2017|work=Kuensel Online|date=2 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Buddha did sometimes downplay the value respecting older people merely for their age, in this story he illustrates that a senior person should nonetheless be respected for their experience, because, as Tachibana points out, "the maturity of age is generally the sign of much experience".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tachibana|first1=S.|title=The ethics of Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/?id=BRWyqi2K4WUC|date=1992|publisher=[[Curzon Press]]|location=Richmond, Surrey|isbn=978-0-7007-0230-5|page=224|edition=Facsim.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the story led to the establishment of several rules of conduct with regard to respect for seniority in the context of the monastic life, in which the {{em|number of years ordained}} as a [[Bhikkhu|monk]] (''{{lang-sa|bhikṣu}}''; ''{{lang-pi|bhikkhu}}'') is measured, rather than {{em|age}}.&lt;ref name="Chalmers 1895" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shaw|first1=Sarah|title=The Jatakas: Birth Stories of the Bodhisatta|date=2006|publisher=[[Penguin UK]]|isbn=9788184750348|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Ay4WFGQtSy0C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhist monk [[Thanissaro Bhikkhu]] explains the relation between respect for seniority and harmony, drawing from the story: "A hierarchy based on seniority, however, is both objective and, in the long run, less oppressive: One's place in the hierarchy is not a measure of one's worth.  Such a hierarchy also discourages the pride and competition that would come if bhikkhus could fight their way up the hierarchy by outdoing the measurable merit of others."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/bmc2.pdf|title=The Buddhist Monastic Code|date=2013|publisher=[[Metta Forest Monastery]]|year=|isbn=|edition=3rd|volume=II|location=California|page=92|pages=|quote=|author-link=Thanissaro Bhikkhu|via=|last1=Bhikkhu|first1=Thanissaro}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The four animals represent the different [[habitats]] of the animal world—the sky, the trees, the ground, and underground.&lt;ref name="Beer 2003" /&gt;{{rp|51}} The partridge assumes the role of the most senior animal: in pre-modern India, the partridge was highly regarded for its intelligence and understanding  of language.&lt;ref name="Gutierrez 2014"&gt;{{cite thesis|title=The Parrot’s Voice and the Partridge’s Feathers: The Languaging of Animals and Animal Language in Early Indian Texts|url=https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/28521|first=Andrea Lorene|last=Gutiérrez|publisher=[[The University of Texas]]|type=M.A. Thesis|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The excreting of the seed of the tree is relevant, because some Indian trees are believed to only sprout when the seed is excreted by a bird, thus further amplifying the concept of cooperation and mutual dependence.&lt;ref name="Beer 2003" /&gt;{{rp|53}} The image of the animals standing on each other’s shoulders, on the back of a patient elephant, also portrays social and environmental harmony: the bird finds a seed and plants it, then the rabbit waters it, and the monkey fertilizes it. Once the seed sprouts and begins to grow, the elephant protects it. After some time, the small plant grows into a big, beautiful tree full of healthy fruit. By working together and using their individual talents, the four friends are able to reach and enjoy the fruit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.folklife.si.edu/resources/pdf/Signs/Bhutan/BH_PRG_03.pdf|title=The Four Harmonious Friends|last=|first=|date=12 June 2008|website=[[Smithsonian Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary source for the Buddhist legend of the four harmonious brothers is the ''[[Vinaya Pitaka|Vinayavastu]]'' ({{bo|w='dul ba'i gzhi}}), which forms the first section of the [[Kangyur]], the canon of [[Tibetan Buddhism]].&lt;ref name="Dagyab 2016" /&gt;{{rp|107}}&lt;ref name="sagaster" /&gt; In canons of other Buddhist traditions, such as in the [[Pali Canon]] of [[Theravāda]] Buddhism, and in the texts of the [[Mahāsāṃghika]], [[Mulasarvastivada|Mūla-Sarvāstivāda]] and [[Sarvāstivāda]] orders, almost the same ''Jātaka'' tale is found in the ''Vinaya'' and ''Jātaka'' collections. The [[Dharmaguptaka]] and [[Mahīśāsaka]] orders did not consider the story part of the ''Jātaka'', however, and only included it in their ''Vinayas''. [[Bhikkhu Analayo]] believes that originally the story was not considered a previous life of the Buddha, but only a [[didactic]] [[parable]] taught by the Buddha.&lt;ref name="Analayo 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Anālayo|first1=Bhikkhu|author-link=Bhikkhu Analayo|title=Canonical Jātaka Tales in Comparative Perspective: The Evolution of Tales of the Buddha's Past Lives|journal=Fuyan Buddhist Studies|date=2012|volume=7|url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/38470683/CanonicalJatakas.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1485644573&amp;Signature=et7fWx%2FMyFxtAwEa%2BgTKug1ISow%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DCanonical_Jataka_Tales_in_Comparative_Pe.pdf|publisher=Fuyan Buddhist Institute|location=[[Hsinchu]]|issn=2070-0512}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Old Irish]] scholar [[Eleanor Hull]] has pointed out that the story may reveal a custom of the ancient world to determine the date based on the life spans of different animals. Stories dealing with the question which animal lives the longest are found throughout the world. Asiatic versions of the story usually feature three animals, as indeed, the Pali and Chinese versions of the ''Jātaka'' do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hull|first1=Eleanor|author-link=Eleanor Hull|title=The Hawk of Achill or the Legend of the Oldest Animals|journal=Folklore|date=December 1932|volume=43|issue=4|pages=377, 383|doi=10.1080/0015587X.1932.9718462|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0015587X.1932.9718462}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ralston|first1=W.R.S.|title=The Bible of Tibet: Tibetan Tales from Indian Sources|date=2012|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=978-1-136-20297-1|page=302|url=https://books.google.com/?id=eoiZAeFA_8YC|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; As for the fourth animal not present in the Pali version, the hare—it was included in later versions.&lt;ref name="Beer 2003" /&gt;{{rp|51}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kimball|first1=Mike|title=Our heritage is already broken: meditations on a regenerative conservation for cultural and natural heritage|journal=Human Ecology Review|date=2016|page=13|doi=10.4225/13/581fcdf8dc329|url=http://hdl.handle.net/1885/100985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gaitelgrima''' is a [[Lombards|Lombard]] feminine name. There are several notable Gaitelgrimas in history.  The identities of these five women (as well as some others of the same name) are often confused because they were all closely related to each other and to two men: [[Guaimar III of Salerno]] and his son, [[Guaimar IV of Salerno|Guaimar IV]]; they were the princes of Salerno from about 983 to 1027 and from 1027 to 1052.

The first was '''Gaitelgrima of Capua''', daughter of [[Atenulf I of Capua]], married [[Guaimar II of Salerno]] and was the mother of [[Gisulf I of Salerno]]. 

The second, also '''Gaitelgrima of Capua''' or '''Gaitelgrima of Benevento''' (died after 1027), was the daughter of [[Pandulf II of Benevento]] and sister of [[Pandulf IV of Capua]].  She was the second wife of Guaimar III and mother of Guaimar IV (his successor), [[Guy, Duke of Sorrento|Guy]] (later duke of [[Sorrento]]), and [[Pandulf of Capaccio|Pandulf]] (later lord of [[Capaccio]]).  She was also the mother of the third Gaitelgrima.  

This third was '''Gaitelgrima of Salerno''', also known as '''Altrude''', who married successively two brothers, [[Drogo of Hauteville]] and [[Humphrey of Hauteville]], who were [[counts of Apulia]].  Through the latter, she was mother to [[Abelard of Hauteville|Abelard]] and [[Herman of Hauteville|Herman]].  

The fourth, also named after Gaitelgrima of Benevento, was also a '''[[Gaitelgrima, daughter of Guaimar IV|Gaitelgrima of Salerno]]'''.  She was the daughter of Guaimar IV of Salerno (see above) and Gemma.  She was married off by her brother [[Gisulf II of Salerno]] to [[Jordan I of Capua]] as was her sister, [[Sichelgaita]], to [[Robert Guiscard]]. 

The last was '''Gaitelgrima, [[Duke of Apulia|Duchess of Apulia]]''', the second wife of [[William II, Duke of Apulia]].  She was the daughter of [[Jordan II of Capua]]. She deeply loved her husband and cut off her hair to cover his coffin at his funeral.

'''Geert Adriaans Boomgaard''' (21 September 1788 &amp;ndash; 3 February 1899) was a [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[supercentenarian]]. He is accepted as the first validated supercentenarian case on record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grg.org/Adams/A.HTM |title=Table A - Verified Supercentenarians (Listed Chronologically By Birth Date)|accessdate=2016-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.grg.org/Gallery/Pre1850sGallery.html Gerontology Research Group&lt;/ref&gt; Since there is evidence that he served as a soldier in [[Napoleon]]'s [[Grande Armée]], Boomgaard might in fact have been the oldest military veteran ever for several decades.&lt;ref name="derniersveterans.free.fr"&gt;[http://derniersveterans.free.fr/napoleon1.html Derniers vétérans de l'Armée napoléonienne, Premier Empire] {{fr-icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=November 2016}}

==Life==
[[File:GeertAdriaansBoomgaard.jpg|thumb|left|Boomgaard later in life, in the 1890s]]
Little is known about Boomgaard's life. He was born in [[Groningen (city)|Groningen]], Netherlands, where he also died. His parents were Adriaan Jacobs Boomgaard (1763-1844) and Geesje Geerts Bontekoe (1762-1834).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.delpher.nl/nl/kranten/view?query=Geert+Adriaans+Boomgaard&amp;coll=ddd&amp;identifier=ddd:011010387:mpeg21:a0422&amp;resultsidentifier=ddd:011010387:mpeg21:a0422 Nieuwsblad van het Noorden, 3 April 1982]&lt;/ref&gt; His father was captain on a boat, and civil records say that Geert did the same work.&lt;ref name=wiewaswie1&gt;[https://www.wiewaswie.nl/personen-zoeken/zoeken/document/a2apersonid/163990124/srcid/18794926/oid/31]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=November 2016}} Other sources&lt;ref name="derniersveterans.free.fr"/&gt; say that he had also served as a soldier in the 33rd Light Infantry Regiment in [[Napoleon]]'s [[Grande Armée]].

At the age of 29, on 4 March 1818, he married Stijntje Bus (19 February 1797 - 24 March 1830).&lt;ref name="wiewaswie1"/&gt; Stijntje died aged 33, a month after the birth of their 8th child. A year later, 17 March 1831, Boomgaard married Grietje Abels Jonker (19 May 1788 - 18 May 1864), with whom he had four more children,{{dubious||it seems very unlikely for a woman who was almost 43 at the time of the marriage to still give birth four times, especially in pre-modern times|date=September 2018}} for a total of 12. His last surviving child, Jansje Hinderika, died at the age of 57 in May 1885.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Boomgaard died at age 110 years 135 days in Groningen.

==Evidence==
{{Original research section|date=November 2016}}
Research on Boomgaard was published in three articles by E.J. Heeres in the genealogical periodical ''Gruoninga'' in 1976, 1977 and 1978. The website http://www.stehelene.org, which is dedicated to the rebuilding of the lost archives on the Médaille de Sainte-Hélène, shows his photograph, his (presumed) personal Sainte-Hélène medal, and a certificate which states that "Adriaans, Gerrit, à Groningue, Pays-Bas, received this medal" on behalf of his active military service during the reign of [[Napoleon I]]. The certificate is registered at la Grande Chancellerie No. 1871, and bears the stamped signature of the Duc de Plaisance Général {{ill|Anne-Charles Lebrun|fr}}, Grand Chancelier (1853&amp;ndash;1859).

'''Giedroyć''' ([[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]]: Giedraitis; [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]]: Гедройц; [[French language|French]]: Guedroitz) is a Polish surname, originating from the [[Giedroyć family|Giedroyć princely family]] of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]].

==Overview==
The Second and Third Editions of the Lithuanian Chronicle relate that Giedrius ([[Palemonids]]), a brother of Grand Duke Traidenis of Lithuania (late 13th century), built a castle, named it [[Giedraičiai]], and adopted the title Prince of Giedraičiai.

A document issued by Grand Duke [[Vytautas|Vytautas of Lithuania]] in the period 1399–1429 settled a dispute between the Bishop of Vilnius and the Princes of Giedraičiai. Numerous members of the family were recorded in the 15th and 16th centuries, and thereafter, with the title Prince.

The two lines of the family for which coherent genealogies are available (the family's "central core") descend from (i) Prince Aleksander (late 15th century) and (ii) Prince Bartłomiej (died in 1524).&lt;ref&gt;For a full genealogy of those two lines see [http://www.angelfire.com/realm/gotha/gotha/gotha.htm On-line Gotha]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1569 Act of Union inaugurating the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Polish-Lithuanian Royal Commonwealth]] confirmed that, as previously in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Lithuanian families of dynastic origin remained entitled to use the title Prince. Many subsequent Giedroyć family members, both of the Line of Aleksander and of the Line of Bartłomiej, were recorded with the title Prince – including several (of both Lines) whose right to the title was individually confirmed under Imperial Russian legislation of 1832. Other members did not seek such specific confirmation under the Russian Empire, but relied on confirmation of their noble status and princely origins under Russian legislation of 1801/3. The Imperial Russian heraldic authority classified these as "of the Princes".

Under the usage of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, as confirmed by the 1569 Act of Union, princely origins in themselves establish princely status.

==Armorial bearings==
The Second Edition of the Lithuanian Chronicle records that a centaur was the armorial charge of the forebears of Giedrus. A decree issued in 1401 by Władisław Jagiello, King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, confirms the right of Prince Michał Giedroyć vel. Ratybor (baptized c.1387) to the arms Hippocentaurus "as used by his illustrious grandfather" Ginwill (2nd Duke of Giedrojcie and candidate to the grand ducal office of Lithuania).

But the earliest surviving illustrated Giedroyć armorial charge is a rose, on seals attached to state documents of 1431-4.

Through the 17th and 18th centuries, the centaur was used predominantly by most members of the family, sometimes in combination with the rose; while the descendants of Mikołaj (died 1657, sixth generation in the Line of Bartłomiej) continued to use the rose alone. But the centaur (sometimes with the rose, sometimes without) predominates in all the 19th century Russian records, even for the descendants of Mikołaj.

At the English College of Arms, the arms of [[Michal Giedroyc]] (born 1929, 16th generation in the Line of Bartłomiej) include both the rose and the centaur (called a sagittary in English heraldry) blazoned as follows: Per fess Or and Gules in chief a Rose Gules barbed and seeded proper and in base a Sagittary trippant to the dexter the head facing to the sinister his tail a serpent facing to the dexter holding in the hands a Bow with arrow drawn and set towards the head of the serpent all Or.

The pennon is a small elongated flag, either pointed or swallow-tailed (when swallow-tailed it may be described as a [[banderole]]{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=312}}). It was charged with the [[heraldic badge]] or some other armorial ensign of the owner, and displayed on his own lance, as a personal ensign. The ''pennoncelle'' was a modification of the pennon.&lt;ref name="Boutell"&gt;{{harvnb|Boutell|1914|pp=246-251}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contemporary Scots usage, the pennon is four feet long. It tapers either to a point or to a rounded end as the owner chooses. It is assigned by the [[Lord Lyon King of Arms]] to any armiger who wishes to apply for it.&lt;ref name="lyonflag"&gt;{{harvnb|''lyon-court.com''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Banner===

The [[banner of arms]] (also simply called ''banner'') is square or oblong and larger than the pennon, bearing the entire coat of arms of the owner, composed precisely as upon a shield but in a square or rectangular shape.&lt;ref name="Boutell" /&gt;

{{quote|In the olden time, when a Knight had distinguished himself by conspicuous gallantry, it was the custom to mark his meritorious conduct by prompt advancement on the very field of battle. In such a case, the point or points of the good Knight’s Pennon were rent off, and thus the ... small Flag was reduced to the square form of the Banner, by which thenceforth he was to be distinguished|- Charles Boutell, ''The Handbook to English Heraldry''&lt;ref name="Boutell" /&gt;}}

The banners of members of [[Order of chivalry|Orders of Chivalry]] are typically displayed in the Order's chapel.  Banners of Knights of the [[Order of the Thistle]] are hung in the 1911 chapel of the Order in [[St Giles Cathedral|St Giles High Kirk]] in [[Edinburgh]].{{sfn|Burnett|Hodgson|2001|pp=6–7}}  [[Order of the Garter#Garter Banners in St George's Chapel|Banners of Knights]] of the [[Order of the Garter]] are displayed in [[St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle]].  From Victorian times Garter banners have been approximately 5 feet by 5 feet.{{sfn|Johnston|2011}}

Banners became available to all English armigers as a result of a report by Garter to the Earl Marshal dated 29 January 1906.  The report stated that the size of banner for Esquires and Gentlemen should be considered in the future.&lt;ref name="Garter Woodcock 2011"&gt;{{harvnb|Woodcock|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Until that date they were available to all noblemen and knights banneret.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Berry|1830|p={{page needed|date=July 2016}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2011, Garter Woodcock said that the banner for an Esquire or Gentleman should be the same size as a Marquess’s and those of a lower rank down to Knight, that is, 3 feet by 3 feet.&lt;ref name="Garter Woodcock 2011"/&gt;

In [[Scotland]], the size of personal banners, excluding any fringes, are specified by the [[Lord Lyon]].&lt;ref name="lyonflag"/&gt;

===Standard===
[[File:Stafford flag.png|left|thumb|300px|Standard of Sir Henry de Stafford, about 1475, features the [[Stafford knot]] and [[Bohun swan]] [[heraldic badge]]s differenced with a ''crescent gules'' for [[cadency]]. The standard bears the [[St George's Cross|Cross of Saint George]] for England.  Black and red (''sable and gules'') are Sir Henry's livery colours.{{sfn|Boutell|1914|p=251}}]]

The heraldic standard appeared about the middle of the fourteenth century, and was in general use by personages of high rank in the two following centuries.  The standard appears to have been adopted for the special purpose of displaying badges. "The badge was worn on his livery by a servant as retainer, and consequently the standard by which he mustered in camp was of the livery colours, and bore the badge, with both of which the retainer was familiar."&lt;ref name="Boutell" /&gt;

Heraldic flags that are used by individuals, like a monarch, as a means of identification are often called ''standards'' (e.g. [[royal standard]]). These flags, more usually ''banners'', however are not standards in a strict heraldic sense but have come to be known as such. A standard is not rectangular: it tapers, usually from 4 feet down to 2 feet, and the [[flag terminology|fly]] edge is rounded (lanceolate). In [[England]] any armiger who has been granted a badge is entitled to fly a standard.

The medieval English standard was larger than the other flags, and its size varied with the owner’s rank. The [[St George's Cross|Cross of St. George]] usually appeared next to the staff, and the rest of the field was generally divided ''per fess'' (horizontally) into two colours, in most cases the livery colours of the owner. "With some principal figure or device occupying a prominent position, various badges are displayed over the whole field, a [[motto]], which is placed bend-wise, having divided the standard into compartments. The edges are fringed throughout, and the extremity is sometimes swallow-tailed, and sometimes rounded."&lt;ref name="Boutell" /&gt;

The [[Oriflamme]] was the [[royal standard]] of the [[King of France]] during the [[Middle Ages]].

In [[Scotland]], a standard requires a separate grant by the [[Lord Lyon]]. Such a grant is only made if certain conditions are met.

The length of the standard depends upon one’s [[Peerage|noble rank]].&lt;ref name="lyonflag"/&gt;

===Banderole===
{{main article|Banderole}}

A '''Banderole''' ([[French language|Fr.]] for a "little banner"), has both a literal descriptive meaning for its use by knights and ships, and is also heraldic device for representing bishops.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=312}}

===Gonfalone===
[[File:Royal Banner of Denmark (14th Century).svg|thumb|160px|Royal Banner of the King of Denmark in the 14th century, based on the [[Coat of arms of Denmark|Royal Arms of Denmark]].]]
{{main article|Gonfalone}}

A gonfalone or gonfalon is a vertically hung banner emblazoned with a coat of arms.  Gonfalons have wide use in civic, religious, and academic heraldry.  The term originated in [[Florence]], [[Italy]], where communities, or neighborhoods, traditionally displayed ''gonfaloni'' in public ceremonies.

=== Guidon ===

&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:RGH Guidon small.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Guidon of the Royal Gloucestershire Hussars]] --&gt;

The Scots guidon is similar in shape to the standard and pennon.  At 6.5' long, it is smaller than the standard and twice the size of the pennon. Guidons are assigned by the Lord Lyon to those individuals who qualify for a grant of supporters to their Arms and to other individuals who have a following such as individuals who occupy a position of leadership or a long-term official position commanding the loyalty of more than a handful of people. The Guidon tapers to a round, unsplit end at the fly.&lt;ref name="lyonflag"/&gt;

A guidon can also refer to a cavalry troop's banner, such as that which survived the Custer massacre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/40608795/ns/us_news-life/#.USl8s1f_rOc|title=Custer's 'Last Flag' sells for $2.2 million|author=|date=10 December 2010|website=nbcnews.com|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pinsel ===
The Scottish pinsel is triangular in shape, 2.5 feet high at the hoist and 4.5 feet in width tapering to a point. This is the flag denoting a person to whom a [[Scottish clan|Clan]] Chief has delegated authority for a particular occasion, such as a [[clan gathering]] when the Chief is absent. This flag is allotted only to Chiefs or very special Chieftain-Barons for practical use, and only upon the specific authority of the Lord Lyon King of Arms.&lt;ref name="lyonflag"/&gt;

A '''hero''' (masculine) or '''heroine''' (feminine) is a real person or a main character of a literary work who, in the face of danger, combats adversity through feats of [[ingenuity]], [[bravery]] or [[Physical strength|strength]]; the original hero type of classical epics did such things for the sake of glory and honor. On the other hand are [[Medieval]] and [[modern history|modern]] heroes, who perform great deeds for the common good instead of the classical goal of pride and fame.

The concept of the hero can be found in [[classical literature]]. It is the main or revered character in [[Epic poetry|heroic epic poetry]] celebrated through ancient legends of a people, often striving for military conquest and living by a continually flawed personal honor code.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Encyclopedia - Britannica Online Encyclopedia|url = http://academic.eb.com/EBchecked/topic/263398/hero|website = academic.eb.com|accessdate = 2015-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of a hero has changed throughout time. [[Webster's Dictionary|Merriam Webster]] dictionary defines a hero as "a person who is admired for great or brave acts or fine qualities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hero|title=Definition of HERO|website=www.merriam-webster.com|accessdate=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of heroes range from mythological figures, such as [[Gilgamesh]], [[Achilles]] and [[Iphigenia]], to historical figures, such as [[Joan of Arc]] or [[Sophie Scholl]], modern heroes like [[Alvin York]], [[Audie Murphy]] and [[Chuck Yeager]], and fictional [[superheroes]], including [[Superman]] and [[Batman]].

==Etymology==
The word ''hero'' comes from the Greek ἥρως (''hērōs''), "hero" (literally "protector" or "defender"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=hero|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|website=etymonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly one such as [[Heracles]] with divine ancestry or later given divine honors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dh%28%2Frws ἥρως]
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; Before the decipherment of [[Linear B]] the original form of the word was assumed to be *{{lang|grc|ἥρωϝ-}}, ''hērōw-'', but the Mycenaean compound ''ti-ri-se-ro-e'' demonstrates the absence of -w-.

According to the ''[[American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]'', the [[Proto-Indo-European]] root is ''*ser'' meaning "to protect". According to Eric Partridge in ''Origins,'' the Greek word  ''Hērōs'' "is akin to" the Latin ''seruāre,'' meaning ''to safeguard''. Partridge concludes, "The basic sense of both [[Hera]] and hero would therefore be 'protector'." [[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]] rejects an Indo-European derivation and asserts that the word has a [[Pre-Greek]] origin.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]], ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', Brill, 2009, p. 526.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Antiquity==
{{see also|Greek hero cult}}
A classical hero is considered to be a "warrior who lives and dies in the pursuit of honor" and asserts their greatness by "the brilliancy and efficiency with which they kill".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Each classical hero's life focuses on fighting, which occurs in war or during an epic quest. Classical heroes are commonly semi-divine and extraordinarily gifted, like [[Achilles]], evolving into heroic characters through their perilous circumstances.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; While these heroes are incredibly resourceful and skilled, they are often foolhardy, court disaster, risk their followers' lives for trivial matters, and behave arrogantly in a childlike manner.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; During classical times, people regarded heroes with the highest esteem and utmost importance, explaining their prominence within epic literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Levin | first1 = Saul | year = 1984 | title = Love and the Hero of the Iliad | url = | journal = Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association | volume = 80 | issue = | pages = 43–50 | doi=10.2307/283510| jstor = 283510 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The appearance of these mortal figures marks a revolution of audiences and writers turning away from [[Twelve Olympians|immortal gods]] to mortal mankind, whose heroic moments of glory survive in the memory of their descendants, extending their legacy.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;

[[Hector]] was a [[Troy|Trojan]] prince and the greatest fighter for Troy in the [[Trojan War]], which is known primarily through [[Homer]]'s ''[[The Iliad]]''. Hector acted as leader of the Trojans and their allies in the defense of Troy, "killing 31,000 Greek fighters," offers Hyginus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hyginus]], ''[[Fabulae]]'' 115.&lt;/ref&gt; Hector was known not only for his courage but also for his noble and courtly nature. Indeed, Homer places Hector as peace-loving, thoughtful as well as bold, a good son, husband and father, and without darker motives. However, his familial values conflict greatly with his heroic aspirations in ''The Iliad,'' as he cannot be both the protector of [[Troy]] and a father to his child.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Hector is ultimately betrayed by the gods when [[Athena]] appears disguised as his ally [[Deiphobus]] and convinces him to take on Achilles, leading to his death at the hands of a superior warrior.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Homer. ''The Iliad.'' Trans. Robert Fagles (1990). NY: Penguin Books. Chapter 14&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:The_Rage_of_Achilles,_by_Giovanni_Battista_Tiepolo_(1696-1770),_Italian_Rococo_painter.jpg|thumb|An 18th century depiction of ''The Rage of Achilles'', by [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]]|302x302px]][[Achilles]] was a Greek Hero who was considered the most formidable military fighter in the entire Trojan War and the central character of ''The Iliad.'' He was the child of [[Thetis]] and [[Peleus]], making him a [[Demigod|demi-god]]. He wielded superhuman strength on the battlefield and was blessed with a close relationship to the [[Greek gods|Gods]]. Achilles famously refuses to fight after his dishonoring at the hands of Agamemnon, and only returns to the war due to unadulterated rage after Hector kills his close friend [[Patroclus]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Achilles was known for uncontrollable rage that defined many of his bloodthirsty actions, such as defiling Hector's corpse by dragging it around the city of Troy. Achilles plays a tragic role in ''The Iliad'' brought about by constant [https://books.google.com/books?id=5TFUv2VRKd8C&amp;pg=PA91&amp;lpg=PA91&amp;dq=achilles+dehumanization&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5D2sb_hGx_&amp;sig=iJrfJQdt0VhRVG2iJoRf-Nc6oqA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwje8uWTosvJAhWGyT4KHZE7BUoQ6AEIJTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=achilles%20dehumanization&amp;f=false de-humanization] throughout the epic, having his ''menis'' (wrath) overpower his ''philos'' (love).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Mortal Hero: An Introduction to Homer's Iliad|last = Schein|first = Seth|publisher = University of California Press|year = 1984|isbn = |location = |pages = 58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heroes in myth often had close but conflicted relationships with the gods. Thus Heracles's name means "the glory of [[Hera]]", even though he was tormented all his life by Hera, the Queen of the Gods. Perhaps the most striking example is the Athenian king [[Erechtheus]], whom [[Poseidon]] killed for choosing [[Athena]] over him as the city's patron god. When the Athenians worshiped Erechtheus on the [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]], they invoked him as ''Poseidon  Erechtheus''.

[[Destiny|Fate]], or destiny, plays a massive role in the stories of classical heroes. The classical hero's heroic significance stems from battlefield conquests, an inherently dangerous action.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The gods in [[Greek mythology|Greek Mythology]], when interacting with the heroes, often foreshadow the hero's eventual death on the battlefield. Countless heroes and gods go to great lengths to alter their  pre-destined fate, but with no success, as no immortal can change their prescribed outcomes by the [[Fates|three Fates]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.auburn.wednet.edu/cms/lib03/WA01001938/Centricity/Domain/2205/Fate%20reading.pdf|title = Articles and musing on the concept of Fate for the ancient Greeks|date = |accessdate = |website = Auburn University|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most prominent example of this is found in ''[[Oedipus Rex]].'' After learning that his son, [[Oedipus]], will end up killing him, the King of Thebes, [[Laius]], takes huge steps to assure his son's death by removing him from the kingdom. But, Oedipus slays his father without an afterthought when he unknowingly encounters him in a dispute on the road many years later. The lack of recognition enabled Oedipus to slay his father, ironically further binding his father to his fate.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Stories of heroism may serve as [[moral example]]s. However, classical heroes often didn't embody the Christian notion of an upstanding, perfectly moral hero.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Four Conceptions of the Heroic|url = http://www.fellowshipofreason.com/archives/4heroes.htm|website = www.fellowshipofreason.com|accessdate = 2015-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Achilles's character-issues of hateful rage lead to merciless slaughter and his overwhelming pride lead to him only joining the Trojan War because he didn't want his soldiers to win all of the glory. Classical heroes, regardless of their morality, were placed in religion. In [[classical antiquity]], cults that venerated deified heroes such as [[Heracles]], [[Perseus]], and [[Achilles]] played an important role in Ancient Greek religion.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Graf, Fritz. (2006) "Hero Cult." ''Brills New Pauly.'' Retrieved from http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/brill-s-new-pauly/hero-cult-e511460?s.num=1&amp;s.f.s2_parent=s.f.book.brill-s-new-pauly&amp;s.q=hero.&lt;/ref&gt; These ancient [[Greek hero cult]]s worshipped heroes from oral [[Epic Cycle|epic tradition]], with these heroes often bestowing blessings, especially healing ones, on individuals.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Myth and monomyth==
[[File:JourneytotheWest.jpg|right|300px|thumb|The four heroes from the 16th-century Chinese novel ''[[Journey to the West]]'']]
The concept of the "Mythic Hero Archetype" was first developed by [[FitzRoy Somerset, 4th Baron Raglan|Lord Raglan]] in his 1936 book, ''The Hero, A Study in Tradition, Myth and Drama''. It is a set of 22 common traits that he said were shared by many heroes in various cultures, myths and religions throughout history and around the world.  Raglan argued that the higher the score, the more likely the figure is mythical.&lt;ref&gt;Lord Raglan. ''The Hero: A Study in Tradition, Myth and Drama by Lord Raglan'', Dover Publications, 1936&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of a story archetype of the standard [[monomyth]]ical "hero's [[quest]]" that was reputed to be pervasive across all cultures is somewhat controversial. Expounded mainly by [[Joseph Campbell]] in his 1949 work ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]'', it illustrates several uniting themes of hero stories that hold similar ideas of what a hero represents, despite vastly different cultures and beliefs. The monomyth or Hero's Journey  consists of three separate stages including the Departure, Initiation, and Return. Within these stages there are several archetypes that the hero or heroine may follow including the call to adventure (which they may initially refuse), supernatural aid, proceeding down a road of trials, achieving a realization about themselves (or an apotheosis), and attaining the freedom to live through their quest or journey. Campbell offered examples of stories with similar themes  such as [[Krishna]], [[Buddha]], [[Apollonius of Tyana]], and [[Jesus]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Joseph Campbell in ''The Hero With a Thousand Faces'' Princeton University Press, 2004 [1949], 140, {{ISBN|0-691-11924-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the themes he explores is the androgynous hero, who combines male and female traits, like Bodhisattva: "The first wonder to be noted here is the androgynous character of the Bodhisattva: masculine Avalokiteshvara, feminine Kwan Yin."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In his 1968 book, ''The Masks of God: Occidental Mythology'', Campbell writes "It is clear that, whether accurate or not as to biographical detail, the moving legend of the Crucified and Risen Christ was fit to bring a new warmth, immediacy, and humanity, to the old motifs of the beloved [[Tammuz (deity)|Tammuz]], [[Adonis]], and [[Osiris]] cycles."&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Campbell]]. The Masks of God: Occidental Mythology'' Penguin, reprinted, {{ISBN|0-14-004306-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Slavic fairy tales==
[[File:Vasnetsov samolet.jpg|thumb|[[Ivan Tsarevich]], a hero of [[Slavic mythology|Russian folklore]]]]
[[Vladimir Propp]], in his analysis of the Russian [[fairy tale]], concluded that a fairy tale had only eight ''[[dramatis personæ]]'', of which one was the hero,&lt;ref name="Propp"&gt;Vladimir Propp, ''Morphology of the Folk Tale'', {{ISBN|0-292-78376-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|p. 80}} and his analysis has been widely applied to non-Russian folklore. The actions that fall into such a hero's sphere include:
# Departure on a quest
# Reacting to the test of a [[Donor (fairy tale)|donor]]
# Marrying a princess (or similar figure)
Propp distinguished between ''seekers'' and ''victim-heroes''. A [[villain]] could initiate the issue by kidnapping the hero or driving him out; these were victim-heroes. On the other hand, an antagonist could rob the hero, or kidnap someone close to him, or, without the villain's intervention, the hero could realize that he lacked something and set out to find it; these heroes are seekers. Victims may appear in tales with seeker heroes, but the tale does not follow them both.&lt;ref name="Propp" /&gt;{{Rp|36}}

==Historical studies==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Philosophy of history]] --&gt;
{{Further information|Philosophy of history|Great man theory}}
No history can be written without consideration of the lengthy list of [[List of medals for bravery|recipients of national medals for bravery]], populated by firefighters, policemen and policewomen, ambulance medics and ordinary have-a-go heroes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/12/25/1040511087609.html smh.com.au: "Everyday heroes"], 26 Dec 2002&lt;/ref&gt; These persons risked their lives to try to save or protect the lives of others: for example, the Canadian [[Cross of Valour (Canada)|Cross of Valour (C.V.)]] "recognizes acts of the most conspicuous courage in circumstances of extreme peril";&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gg.ca/document.aspx?id=13503 gg.ca: "Decorations for Bravery Ceremony"], 2 Feb 2010&lt;/ref&gt; examples of recipients are [[Mary Dohey]] and [[David Gordon Cheverie]].

The philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] gave a central role to the "hero", personalized by [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]], as the incarnation of a particular culture's ''[[Volksgeist]]'', and thus of the general ''[[Zeitgeist]]''. [[Thomas Carlyle]]'s 1841 ''On Heroes, Hero Worship and the Heroic in History'' also accorded a key function to heroes and great men in history. Carlyle centered history on the [[biography]] of a few central individuals such as [[Oliver Cromwell]] or [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick the Great]]. His heroes were political and military figures, the founders or topplers of states. His history of great men included geniuses good and, perhaps for the first time in historical study, evil.

Explicit defenses of Carlyle's position were rare in the second part of the 20th century. Most in the [[philosophy of history]] school contend that the motive forces in history can best be described only with a wider lens than the one that Carlyle used for his portraits. For example, [[Karl Marx]] argued that history was determined by the massive social forces at play in "[[class struggle]]s", not by the individuals by whom these forces are played out. After Marx, [[Herbert Spencer]] wrote at the end of the 19th century: "You must admit that the genesis of the great man depends on the long series of complex influences which has produced the race in which he appears, and the social state into which that race has slowly grown....Before he can remake his society, his society must make him."&lt;ref name=Spencer&gt;Spencer, Herbert. ''[https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=96277756  The Study of Sociology]'', Appleton, 1896, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michel Foucault]] argued in [[Philosophy of history#Michel Foucault's analysis of historical and political discourse|his analysis of societal communication and debate]] that history was mainly the "science of the [[Sovereignty|sovereign]]", until its inversion by the "historical and political popular discourse".

[[File:Mandela Bust at Southbank.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Bust of Nelson Mandela erected on London's [[South Bank]] by the [[Greater London Council]] administration of [[Ken Livingstone]] in 1985]]

Modern examples of the typical hero are  [[Minnie Vautrin]], [[Norman Bethune]],  [[Alan Turing]], [[Raoul Wallenberg]], [[Chiune Sugihara]], [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], [[Mother Teresa]], [[Nelson Mandela]], [[Oswaldo Paya]], [[Oscar Biscet]], and [[Aung San Suu Kyi]].

The [[Annales School]], led by [[Lucien Febvre]], [[Marc Bloch]] and [[Fernand Braudel]], would contest the exaggeration of the role of [[subject (philosophy)|individual subjects]] in history. Indeed, Braudel distinguished various time scales, one accorded to the life of an individual, another accorded to the life of a few human generations, and the last one to [[civilization]]s, in which [[geography]], [[economics]] and [[demography]] play a role considerably more decisive than that of individual subjects.

Among noticeable events in the studies of the role of the hero and [[Great men theory|Great man]] in history one should mention [[Sydney Hook]]'s book (1943) ''[[Sidney Hook#The Hero in History|The Hero in History]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Hook, S. 1955 [1943]. The Hero in History. A Study in Limitation and Possibility. Boston, MA: Beacon Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In the second half of the twentieth century such male-focused theory has been contested, among others by feminists writers such as [[Judith Fetterley]] in ''The Resisting Reader'' (1977)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Resisting Reader|last = Fetterley|first = Judith|publisher = Indiana University Press|year = 1977|isbn = |location = Bloomington, IN|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and literary theorist [[Nancy K. Miller]], ''The Heroine's Text: Readings in the French and English Novel, 1722–1782''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Heroine's Text: Readings in the French and English Novel, 1722–1782|last = Miller|first = Nancy K.|publisher = Columbia University Press|year = 1980|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the epoch of [[globalization]] an individual can still change the development of the country and of the whole world so this gives reasons to some scholars to suggest returning to the problem of the role of the hero in history from the viewpoint of modern historical knowledge and using up-to-date methods of historical analysis.&lt;ref&gt;[[Leonid Grinin|Grinin, Leonid]]  2010. The Role of an Individual in History: A Reconsideration. Social Evolution &amp; History, Vol. 9 No. 2 (pp. 95–136) [http://www.socionauki.ru/journal/articles/129622/]&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the frameworks of developing [[counterfactual history]], attempts are made to examine some hypothetical scenarios of historical development. The hero attracts much attention because most of those scenarios are based on the suppositions: what would have happened if this or that historical individual had or had not been alive.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson.

== Gender differences ==
If the term "heroine" exists,{{clarify|reason=|date=September 2018}} "hero" is often the predominantly used term even though its neutrality can be put into question. The definitions of the heroine often refer back to the one of the hero, but sometimes insinuate that their deeds are of less value, or were obtained only thanks to their love of God or a country or of a man. Therefore, implying that an external explanation for the extraordinary nature of her deeds is needed to justify them. The warrior women is considered unholy, unnatural. These figures tend to be erased because they don't fit in the feminine values they are supposed to represent.
Acts of heroism coming from women are acceptable, during specific time, like when men are at war, during times of crisis, but they are otherwise often seen as suspicious. Moreover, women are often not individualized, but praised as a group for heroic deeds. [[Women in the military]] were often subordinated to tasks less likely to be praised than armed combat, and are rather praised for their courage as a general force, nurses during wartime are a good example of this phenomenon.
If their story gets told, they are made to fit in the acceptable script. Their story is told in a way as to match the expectations of [[femininity]] ex: maternal love, compassion, fidelity, resistance, defense. Etc. So the set of strengths in which a heroine could historically express her value are overall not the same and perceived as less valuable than their [[masculine]] counterpart.&lt;ref&gt;

{{quote|In general, the cultural repertoire of heroic stories requires different qualities for each gender.

If they get mentioned in history, the way their story is told also differs from their male counterpart, they are generally portrayed as young and beautiful, their actions are limited to a short time
lapse in opposition to the possibility of a long heroic career for male heroes, underlying feelings that led to their heroic acts are underlined, overall less details about their life are kept and
emphasis is put over their tragic death. Not to forget that heroes and heroines are part of a social construct, their history is told and changes throughout history to serve different purposes of memory, propaganda according to diverse social, political or religious evolutions.&lt;ref&gt;

==Modern fiction==
{{Further information|Vanity Fair (novel)|Superhero}}

[[File:Batman_and_Robin_1966.JPG|thumb|225x225px|[[Batman]] ([[Adam West]]) and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] (Burt Ward) in the 1966–1968 TV Series ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]''.]]
	 
The word "hero" or "heroine", in modern times, is sometimes used to describe the [[protagonist]] or the [[Romantic interest (theatre)|love interest]] of a story, a usage which can conflict with the superhuman expectations of heroism.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; A classic example is [[Anna Karenina]], the lead character in the novel of the same title by [[Leo Tolstoy]]. In modern literature the hero is more and more a problematic concept. In 1848, for example, [[William Makepeace Thackeray]] gave ''[[Vanity Fair (novel)|Vanity Fair]]'' the subtitle ''A Novel without a Hero'', and imagined a world in which no sympathetic character was to be found.&lt;ref&gt;[[Northrop Frye]], ''[[Anatomy of Criticism]]'', p. 34, {{ISBN|0-691-01298-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Vanity Fair'' is a satirical representation of the absence of truly moral heroes in the modern world.&lt;ref&gt;Shmoop Editorial Team. (2008, November 11). ''Vanity Fair Theme of Morality and Ethics''. Retrieved December 6, 2015, from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.shmoop.com/vanity-fair-thackeray/morality-ethics-theme.html&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The story focuses on the characters Emmy Sedley and Becky Sharpe (the latter as the clearly defined anti-hero), with the plot focused on the eventual marriage of these two characters to rich men, revealing character flaws as the story progresses. Even the most sympathetic characters, like Captain Dobbin, are susceptible to weakness, as he is often narcissistic and melancholy.

The larger-than-life hero is a more common feature of [[fantasy]] (particularly in [[Comic book|comic-books]] and [[High fantasy|epic fantasy]]) than more realist works.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;[[L. Sprague de Camp]], ''[[Literary Swordsmen and Sorcerers]]:  The Makers of Heroic Fantasy'', p. 5 {{ISBN|0-87054-076-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these larger-than life figures remain prevalent in society. The [[superhero]] genre is a multibillion-dollar industry that includes comic books, movies, toys and video games. Superheroes usually possess extraordinary talents and powers that no living human could ever emulate. The superhero stories often pit a [[Supervillain|super villain]] against the hero, with the hero fighting the crime caused by the super villain. Examples of long-running superheroes include [[Superman]], [[Batman]], [[Spider-Man]] and [[Wonder Woman]].

==Psychology==
[[Social psychology]] has begun paying attention to heroes and heroism. Zeno Franco and [[Philip Zimbardo]] point out differences between heroism and altruism, and they offer evidence that observers' perceptions of unjustified risk plays a role above and beyond risk type in determining the ascription of heroic status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Franco | first1 = Z. | last2 = Blau | first2 = K. | last3 = Zimbardo | first3 = P. | year = 2011 | title = Heroism: A conceptual analysis and differentiation between heroic action and altruism | url = http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2011-07260-001/ | journal = Review of General Psychology | volume = 5 | issue = 2| pages = 99–113 | doi=10.1037/a0022672| citeseerx = 10.1.1.366.8315 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[evolutionary psychology]] explanation for heroic risk-taking is that it is a [[costly signal]] demonstrating the ability of the hero. It can be seen as one form of [[altruism]] for which there are also several other evolutionary explanations.&lt;ref name=AEP1&gt;Pat Barcaly. The evolution of charitable behaviour and the power of reputation. In {{Cite book | last1 = Roberts | first1 = S.

Roma Chatterji has suggested that the hero or more generally protagonist is first and foremost a symbolic representation of the person who is experiencing the story while reading, listening or watching;&lt;ref name=Chatterji&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chatterji|first=Roma|date=January 1986|title=The Voyage of the Hero: The Self and the Other in One Narrative Tradition of Purulia|journal=Contributions to Indian Sociology|issue=19|pages=95–114|doi=10.1177/006996685019001007|volume=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus the relevance of the hero to the individual relies a great deal on how much similarity there is between the two. One reason for the hero-as-self interpretation of stories and myths is the human inability to view the world from any perspective but a personal one.

In the [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning book ''[[The Denial of Death]]'', [[Ernest Becker]] argues that human civilization is ultimately an elaborate, symbolic defense mechanism against the knowledge of our mortality, which in turn acts as the emotional and intellectual response to our basic [[survival mechanism]]. Becker explains that a basic duality in human life exists between the physical world of objects and a symbolic world of human meaning. Thus, since humanity has a dualistic nature consisting of a physical self and a symbolic self, we are able to transcend the [[dilemma]] of mortality through [[heroism]], by focusing our attention mainly on our symbolic selves. This symbolic self-focus takes the form of an individual's "[[immortality]] project" (or "''[[causa sui]]'' project"), which is essentially a symbolic belief-system that ensures oneself is believed superior to physical reality.  By successfully living under the terms of the immortality project, people feel they can become heroic and, henceforth, part of something eternal; something that will never die as compared to their physical body. This, in turn, gives people the feeling that their lives have meaning, a purpose, and are significant in the grand scheme of things. Another theme running throughout the book is that humanity's traditional "hero-systems", such as [[religion]], are no longer convincing in the [[Age of Enlightenment|age of reason]]. Science attempts to serve as an immortality project, something that Becker believes it can never do, because it is unable to provide agreeable, absolute meanings to human life. The book states that we need new convincing "illusions" that enable us to feel heroic in ways that are agreeable. Becker, however, does not provide any definitive answer, mainly because he believes that there is no perfect solution. Instead, he hopes that gradual realization of humanity's innate motivations, namely death, can help to bring about a better world. [[Terror Management Theory]] has generated evidence supporting this perspective.

The '''Imperial Standards of Iran''' were the personal official flags of the [[Shāhanshāh]], [[Shahbānū]], and Crown Prince of Iran, adopted at the beginning of 1971.

The official flag of Shāhanshāh consisted of a pale-blue field with the [[flag of Iran]] in the upper left corner and the Pahlavi coat of arms in the centre. At the top of the coat of arms was the Pahlavi crown, created for the Coronation of [[Rezā Shāh of Iran|Rezā Shāh]] in 1926. The Imperial motto of Pahlavi is "''Mara dad farmud va Khod Davar Ast''" ("Justice He bids me do, as He will judge me" or, alternatively, "He gave me power to command, and He is the judge").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fotw.net/flags/ir_imp-i.html|title=Iranian Empire (Pahlavi dynasty): Imperial standards|accessdate=2007-05-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070412122220/http://fotw.net/flags/ir_imp-i.html|archivedate=2007-04-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pale blue]] was the colour of the Imperial Family. The uniforms of the Imperial Guard included this colour to show their allegiance.

On 21 November 2013 [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]] from the [[National Crime Agency#Organisational Structure|Human Trafficking Unit]] arrested two suspects at a residential address in [[Lambeth]], [[South London]]. A 73-year-old ethnic Indian [[Singaporean]] man, Aravindan Balakrishnan, and a 67-year-old [[Tanzanian]]&lt;ref name = "growing up"/&gt; woman, his wife, Chanda Pattni, had been investigated for [[slavery]] and [[domestic servitude]].&lt;ref name="Halliday"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Standard"/&gt; The case centred around the [[Workers' Institute of Marxism–Leninism–Mao Zedong Thought]] commune which was led by Balakrishnan. In the early 1980s after a police raid, Balakrishnan decided to move the group's activities underground. Balakrishnan's control over his followers intensified and the commune became a prison to his followers.  On 25 October 2013, three women were rescued from the commune. These were: a 69-year-old [[Malaysians in the United Kingdom|Malaysian]] woman (later revealed to be Aishah Wahab),&lt;ref name="Sawer"/&gt; a 57-year-old [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] woman (Josephine Herivel) and a 30-year-old [[United Kingdom|British]] woman (Katy Morgan-Davies).&lt;ref name="Standard"&gt;{{cite news |title=Women victims 'held for 30 years' |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/panewsfeeds/women-victims-held-for-30-years-8954976.html |publisher=London Evening Standard |date=21 November 2013 |accessdate=21 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Katy Morgan-Davies was born into the sect and hadn't experienced the outside world until her release.

==Perpetrator==
'''Aravindan Balakrishnan''' (known to his followers as "'''Comrade Bala'''") was born in [[Kerala]], [[India]] but migrated to  [[Singapore]], [[British Malaya|Malaya]], where his father was a soldier, when he was 10.&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ward|first1=Victoria|title=Aravindan Balakrishnan: the Maoist cult leader who used brutal violence and rape to strip women of their dignity|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/12031312/Aravindan-Balakrishnan-the-Maoist-cult-leader-who-used-brutal-violence-and-rape-to-strip-women-of-their-dignity.html|accessdate=5 June 2017|work=The Telegraph|date=4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Balakrishnan was a student at [[Raffles Institution]] and later the [[University of Singapore]], where although gaining a reputation as a "quiet chap",&lt;ref name="Reuters-AO"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Reuters|title=UK Maoist cult leader raped followers, enslaved daughter|url=http://www.asiaone.com/world/uk-maoist-cult-leader-raped-followers-enslaved-daughter|accessdate=5 June 2017|work=AsiaOne|date=13 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; he became increasingly politically active and believed that he would have been imprisoned in Singapore had he openly admitted to being a [[communist]].&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele" /&gt; In 1977, while living in London, His Singaporean citizenship – which he gained in 1960 – was revoked due to his leadership of the [[Workers' Institute of Marxism–Leninism–Mao Zedong Thought]], which the [[Ministry of Home Affairs (Singapore)|Ministry of Home Affairs]] accused of engaging in "activities which are prejudicial to the security" of Singapore, and denounced him as a radical "closely associated with [[Eurocommunists]]".&lt;ref name="Reuters-AO" /&gt; The authorities claimed that Balakrishnan and others, many of them former Singaporean students he had associated with in London, were plotting to overthrow Singapore's leader, [[Lee Kuan Yew]].&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele" /&gt;

Despite believing the United Kingdom to be a [[fascist state]] due to its treatment of the people of Singapore during the [[Malayan Emergency]], Balakrishnan emigrated to the UK in 1963 on a [[British Council]] scholarship to study at the [[London School of Economics]], and married his wife Chandra in 1971.&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele" /&gt; Over the years he built up a following by giving lectures and staging various [[sit-in]]s and protests. He was a regular attendee at [[London]] demonstrations, where he waved banners depicting the Chinese leader [[Mao Zedong]] and addressed the crowds.&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele" /&gt;

In 1974, Balakrishnan and his "small clique" were expelled from the [[Communist Party of England (Marxist–Leninist)]] on account of "their pursuance of conspiratorial and [[wikt:splittist|splittist]] activities ... spreading [[social fascist]] slanders against the Party and the proletarian movement" and attempting "to put themselves above the discipline of the Party".&lt;ref name="CPE(M-L) statement"&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/history/erol/uk.hightide/cpestatements.htm "Statements of the National Executive Committee, CPE (ML)"], ''The Marxist-Leninist'', 1:1, September 1974, reprinted at marxists.org. Quoted in Nick Cohen [http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/nick-cohen/2013/11/cultists-communists-too-close-to-us-for-comfort/ "Cultists &amp; communists – too close to us for comfort"], ''The Spectator'' (blog), 25 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The CPE(M–L) "repudiated the metaphysical logic harmfully promoted" by Balakrishnan in "opposition to dialectical materialism and the concrete analysis of concrete conditions".&lt;ref name="CPE(M-L) statement"/&gt; In response, Balakrishnan set up the Workers' Institute and launched his own publication, the ''South London Workers' Bulletin'', which accused the CPE(M–L) of being "fascists" and "agents of imperialism".&lt;ref name="Ford-WW-989"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ford|first1=Eddie|title=Maoist 'slaves': Combating the fascist state in Brixton  - Weekly Worker|url=http://weeklyworker.co.uk/worker/989/maoist-slaves-combating-the-fascist-state-in-brixt/|accessdate=5 June 2017|work=Weekly Worker|issue=989|date=5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1974 and 1976, his followers attempted to "build revolutionary stable base areas in working-class communities",&lt;ref name="On Building a"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Workers’ Institute of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought|title=On Building a Revolutionary Stable Base Area|url=https://www.marxists.org/history/erol/uk.hightide/stable-base.htm|work=Encyclopedia of Anti-Revisionism On-Line|year=1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; primarily [[South London]], and worked in ordinary jobs. Balakrishnan discouraged his followers from joining [[trade unions]], describing them as agents of the "imperialist fascist bourgeoisie".&lt;ref name="Smith-Conv"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Evan|title=Inside the paranoid Maoist cults of 1970s Britain|url=http://theconversation.com/inside-the-paranoid-maoist-cults-of-1970s-britain-20739|accessdate=5 June 2017|work=The Conversation|date=28 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, after the more liberal members of his group drifted away, a cult of around 10 female members formed around him. The collective moved to Brixton in 1976, under the title [[Workers Institute of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought]].&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele" /&gt; Following [[Mao Zedong#Death and aftermath|Mao's death in 1976]], the Institute built the Mao Zedong Memorial Centre at 140 Acre Lane, [[Brixton]], which also functioned as a communist collective of "thirteen comrades", with "13 members living on the premises, half in paid work, six doing full-time revolutionary work, with a strong emphasis on women taking a leading role (apart from leading the Party Committee headed by Bala)".&lt;ref name="On Building a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith-Conv" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=High Tide: The Consolidation of Maoism by the Late 1970’s|url=https://www.marxists.org/history/erol/uk.hightide/|accessdate=5 June 2017|work=Encyclopedia of Anti-Revisionism On-Line}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members were handed a rota of chores and only allowed to go out in pairs, which Balakrishnan claimed was because the area they lived in was "notorious for violence" and "anything could happen".&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele2"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ward|first1=Victoria|title=Maoist 'cult' leader denies rape as he claims female commune members competed for his affections|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/12019410/Maoist-cult-leader-denies-rape-as-he-claims-female-commune-members-competed-for-his-affections.html|accessdate=5 June 2017|work=Telegraph|date=26 November 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a police raid on the Memorial Centre in March 1978, which the group claimed  involved "over 200 police", including officers from the [[Special Patrol Group]], "under the pretext of searching for drugs", the Workers' Institute effectively went underground, with the remaining members being convinced to end all contact with others and maintain an intense level of secrecy.&lt;ref name="Smith-Conv" /&gt; Family members were later branded fascist agents and ostracised,&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele" /&gt; and Balakrishnan and his captives moved to a number of properties during this time as a means for him to escape detection from the authorities.&lt;ref name="Smith-Conv" /&gt; Balakrishnan convinced his followers that everything was controlled by him from the sun, the moon, wind and fires; that he could overthrow governments, control natural disasters, and make people live or die.&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele" /&gt; In order to progress his cause, Balakrishnan invented "JACKIE" (an acronym for [[Jehovah]], [[Allah]], [[Christ]], [[Krishna]] and [[Eknath Easwaran|Immortal Easwaran]]) – a type of dangerous, mystical machine that monitored all thought and could control minds.&lt;ref name="Cooke"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cooke|first1=Rachel|title=My 30 years as prisoner of a London cult|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jan/22/katy-morgan-davies-interview-balakrishnan-cult-brixton-survivor|accessdate=5 June 2017|work=The Guardian|date=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Balakrishnan began sexually abusing two of the women in 1979, often physically beating them and making others watch as he did so. All of the women were beaten and four (not including his wife) were said to have been sexually assaulted or engaged with sexual relations with him.&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele" /&gt; Balakrishnan forced the women to swallow his ejaculate as it was "the elixir of life", and claimed the women he sexually abused had been trying to seduce him out of "jealousy" for his lover.&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ward-Tele2" /&gt;

==Victims==
*[[Katy Morgan-Davies]] - born in 1983, she was originally named Prem Maopinduzi Davies. She began calling herself "Rosie" in her teens. She has subsequently changed her name to Katy Morgan-Davies, after the American singer [[Katy Perry]]. She is the biological daughter of Balakrishnan and Sian Davies.&lt;ref name = "growing up"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-b0af7ef5-1031-4e1f-a3ac-b3c21ef0f932|title=Growing up a prisoner in a cult|date=26 January 2017|accessdate=28 January 2017|author=Vanessa Engle|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morgan-Davies was brought up entirely isolated from the outside world and never went to a nursery, school, dentist or doctor. She was not told who her parents were. The commune members taught her to read and write.&lt;ref name=bbc2&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-b0af7ef5-1031-4e1f-a3ac-b3c21ef0f932&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Sian Davies]] - in the early 1980s, after joining the commune, she had a sexual relationship with Balakrishnan.  On Christmas Eve 1996, Morgan-Davies remembered seeing Davies bound and gagged on the living room for trying to escape. Later, she fell out of a top floor bathroom window and was taken to hospital. In hospital she suffered a rapid decline in her mental health and fell into a coma. She died eight months later.  After the fall, her family were told she had gone to India to do charity work.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} At the time of Davie's death her daughter, Morgan-Davies, did not know she was her mother.

*[[Aishah Wahab]] - a [[Malaysians|Malaysian]] woman who moved to the United Kingdom at the age of 24 to study, joining the group shortly after.&lt;ref name = "growing up"/&gt; Aishah was reportedly so drawn in by Balakrishnan's Marxist rhetoric that she left her fiancé and moved in with the collective.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

*[[Oh Kar Eng]] - nurse from [[Malaysia]] who had followed Balakrishnan from the 1970s. She hit her head on a cupboard in 2001 and suffered a stroke. No medical treatment was allowed by the commune and she died the next day.{{r|bbc}} The police were not informed of the accident. Her family were not told about her cremation, and they were told the commune did not have their ashes when in fact they were in a lockup garage in West Norwood.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

*[[Josephine Herivel]] - known as Josie, was a violinist studying at the [[Royal College of Music]] before she joined the group.&lt;ref name = "growing up"/&gt; Her father, [[John Herivel]] was one of the [[Bletchley Park]] [[codebreakers]] who helped Britain and its allies win [[World War II]]. She is believed to have moved to London in the 1970s and disowned her family after becoming involved with the Workers' Institute of Marxism–Leninism–Mao Zedong Thought.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} Herivel initiated the escape plan after becoming concerned with Morgan-Davies rapid weight loss (which was due to undiagnosed diabetes). Medical treatment was not permitted by the commune. Herivel secretly phoned a helpline after memorizing the number from a television program. Herivel has denounced the Balakrishnan sentencing, claiming he has been framed by the state.{{r|bbc}}

==Imprisonment and rescue==
The two older victims are believed to have met Balakrishnan in [[London]] through, according to police, a shared political ideology,&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;Martin Evans [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/10472632/Slavery-case-suspects-named-as-former-Maoist-collective-leaders.html "Slavery case: suspects named as former Maoist collective leaders"], telegraph.co.uk, 25 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt; as he was the leader of the [[Workers' Institute of Marxism–Leninism–Mao Zedong Thought]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channel4.com/news/slave-house-couple-lambeth-leaders-1970s-political-cult 'Slave' house couple 'leaders of 1970s political cult'"], ''[[Channel 4 News]]'', 25 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  The women were not being physically restrained, but held by "invisible handcuffs" after being subjected to [[Mind control|brainwashing]], [[Psychological abuse|emotional abuse]] and [[physical abuse]] by their captors.&lt;ref name="Standard_2"&gt;{{cite news |title=London slave women endured 30 years of beatings, brainwashing and emotional control |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/london-slave-women-endured-30-years-of-beatings-brainwashing-and-emotional-control-8956001.html |publisher=London Evening Standard |date=22 November 2013 |accessdate=23 November 2013 |first=Justin |last=Davenport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two suspects were bailed until April 2014,&lt;ref name="Shaw"&gt;Danny Shaw [https://twitter.com/DannyShawBBC/status/425657327706861568] twitter.com, 21 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and were unable to return to the three-bedroom flat they rented from a housing association.&lt;ref name="Evans"/&gt;

On 11 December 2014, it emerged that Balakrishnan had been charged with offences relating to cruelty to a person under 16, four counts of rape and 17 counts of indecent assault. Balakrishnan appeared before Westminster magistrates on 17 December 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-30431988 "Man charged in London 'slavery' inquiry"], BBC News, 11 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt; His wife, Chanda Pattni, was released earlier in 2014, as there was considered to be insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction.&lt;ref&gt;Josh Halliday [https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/dec/11/london-slavery-case-cps-charges-ravindan-alakrishnan "London ‘slavery’ case: CPS charges Aravindan Balakrishnan"], ''The Guardian'', 11 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 December 2015, Balakrishnan was convicted of child cruelty, false imprisonment, four counts of rape, six counts of indecent assault and two counts of assault.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/dec/04/commune-leader-aravindan-balakrishnan-guilty-of-child-cruelty "Maoist cult leader guilty of child cruelty and sexual assaults"], ''The Guardian'', 4 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 January 2016, Balakrishnan was jailed for 23 years. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Maoist cult leader Aravindan Balakrishnan jailed for 23 years - BBC News|url = https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-35443423|website = BBC News|access-date = 2016-01-29|language = en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{short description|List of people saved by Oskar Schindler during the Holocaust}}

Approximately 1,200 persons were saved by [[Oskar Schindler]] during the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]]. They survived the years of Nazi regime primarily through the intervention of Schindler who found them protected status as industrial workers at his [[Oskar Schindler's Enamel Factory|enamelware factory]] in [[Kraków]] and, after 1944, at an [[Brünnlitz labor camp|armaments factory]] in [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia|occupied Czechoslovakia]]. There, they avoided being sent to [[Extermination camp|death camps]] and survived the war. Schindler expended his personal fortune as an industrialist to save the Schindlerjuden.

Their story has been depicted in the book ''[[Schindler's Ark]]'', by [[Thomas Keneally]], and [[Steven Spielberg]]'s film adaptation of the novel, ''[[Schindler's List]]''. [[Poldek Pfefferberg]], one of the survivors, persuaded Thomas Keneally to write the novel and Steven Spielberg to produce the film.

In 2012, more than 8,500 descendants of people saved by Oskar Schindler lived in the [[United States]], [[Europe]], and [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tribune242.com/news/2012/mar/28/survivor-of-the-holocaust-tells-how-schindler/ Survivor Of The Holocaust Tells How Schindler Saved Her Life] http://www.tribune242.com. Retrieved 3 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The List==
The original list of people who were transported to [[Brünnlitz labor camp|Schindler's Brünnlitz factory]] in [[Brněnec]] ([[Sudetenland|Sudetengau]]) was prepared by [[Mietek Pemper]], [[Itzhak Stern]] and Oskar Schindler&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{cite news |title=Mietek Pemper |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/8578020/Mietek-Pemper.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6BjJNDD9m?url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/8578020/Mietek-Pemper.html |publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |date={{date|2011-6-11|mdy}} |archivedate=2012-10-27 |accessdate={{date|2012-10-27|mdy}} |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mg&gt;{{cite news |first=|last=|title=Oskar Schindler's collaborator, Mietek Pemper, has died |url=http://www.montrealgazette.com/entertainment/movie-guide/Oskar+Schindler+collaborator+dies/4919305/story.html |work=[[Agence France-Presse]] |publisher=[[The Gazette (Montreal)]] |date=2011-06-15 |accessdate=2011-06-26}}{{dead link|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite news |first=Douglas |last=Martin |title=Mietek Pemper, 91, Camp Inmate Who Compiled Schindler's List |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/19/world/europe/19pemper.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110621040823/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/19/world/europe/19pemper.html?_r=1 |publisher=[[New York Times]] |date=18 June 2011 |archivedate=2011-06-21 |accessdate=27 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; during September and October of 1944. That list probably no longer exists.

Another list with 1,000 names, compiled by former camp stenographer Mietek Pemper upon the prisoners' arrival 21 October 1944 at Schindler's Brünnlitz factory, was presented by Pemper to the [[International Tracing Service]] in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.its-arolsen.org/en/help_and_faq/sample_documents/index.html#c2713 Sample Documents from the ITS Archives] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721233447/http://www.its-arolsen.org/en/help_and_faq/sample_documents/index.html |date=2011-07-21}}, [[International Tracing Service]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Two lists of 1,098 prisoners made by camp administration in Brünnlitz on 18 April 1945 are extant,&lt;ref name=list&gt;[http://www.oskarschindler.com/list.htm Schindler's list on www.oskarschindler.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and are preserved in [[Yad Vashem]] Memorial, where Oskar and Emilie Schindler are recognized among [[Righteous Among the Nations|the Righteous]].&lt;ref name=Righteous&gt;[http://www.yadvashem.org/righteous/stories/schindler Schindlers Oskar and Emilie Schindler in The Righteous Among The Nations]&lt;/ref&gt; The first list contains 297 female prisoners while the second list contains 801 male prisoners. There are several preserved copies and carbon copies of the list from April 1945, with some in museums while others are in private hands (mostly of families of former prisoners). In April 2009 a carbon copy of the original list, documenting 801 names, was discovered among the documentation author Thomas Keneally had donated to the [[State Library of New South Wales]] in [[Sydney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2009/04/08/index.php?section=espectaculos&amp;article=a09n2esp|title=Hallan la lista de Schindler|author=Reuters|first=|date=8 April 2009|website=|publisher=[[La Jornada]]|language=es|trans-title=Finding Schindler's List|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Margaret Ann Neve''' (''née'' '''Harvey'''; 18 May 1792 – 4 April 1903) was the first recorded female [[supercentenarian]] and the second validated human to reach the age of 110 after [[Geert Adriaans Boomgaard]]. She lived at [[Saint Peter Port]] on the island of [[Guernsey]] in the [[English Channel]]. She was also the first proven individual whose life spanned three centuries (18th to the 20th centuries).

==Family==
By Margaret's birth her family was already well-established on the island. Her father John Harvey was born in Cornwall in 1771 to John (1736-1778) and Margaret Ann Parker (d.1790). John Harvey was involved in merchant shipping and [[privateer]]ing, earning a great amount of wealth over the years. He married Elizabeth Harvey (''née'' Guille) when they were both 19. John died on 4 December 1820 at the age of 49, and  Elizabeth lived with her remaining children in a house called "Chaumière" ("The Cottage"), which he had bought in 1808.&lt;ref name="Priaulx"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.priaulxlibrary.co.uk/priaulx-library-new-details2.asp?ItemID=95 |title=The Harvey Family |work=Priaulx Library |date=2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022135751/http://www.priaulxlibrary.co.uk/priaulx-library-new-details2.asp?ItemID=95 |archivedate=October 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth died in 1871 at the age of 99.&lt;ref name="Priaulx" /&gt;

Together they had seven children:
* Margaret (1792-1903)
* John (1793-1865) - married Anne Sophia Grut (1802-1844) in 1826 and moved to Jersey, then England. They had a son named Thomas, who served in the militia and became a merchant.
* Elizabeth (1796-) - never married.
* Maria (1799) and Augusta (1801) had died as infants.
* Thomas (1803) emigrated to the United States.
* Augusta (1804) - married.
* Louisa (1805-1821)

==Early life and marriage==
Born Margaret Harvey on 18 May 1792, the eldest of seven children, most of her childhood was spent in [[Guernsey]]. Early in her life she survived a fall down the stairs, which left her [[concussion|concussed]] for three days.&lt;ref name="Priaulx" /&gt;

Neve, as she would become, could remember the turmoil that the [[French Revolution]] brought to Guernsey; at the time, her father was in command of the militia on the island. In 1807, at the age of 15, Neve set sail for [[Weymouth, Dorset|Weymouth]] with her father, but a storm caused the ship to land at [[Chesil Beach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geog.cam.ac.uk/research/projects/chambersofcommerce/guernsey-1808-9.pdf |title=Guernsey (Channel Islands) chamber of commerce, members in 1808-9.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Priaulx" /&gt;

She was educated in [[Bristol]], England, gaining an interest in literature and poetry. In 1815, she went to a "finishing school" in Brussels, becoming fluent in French and Italian and able to converse in German and Spanish. She would read the [[New Testament]] in Greek.&lt;ref name=BIB/&gt;{{rp|19}}

With her headmistress, she visited the battlefield of [[Waterloo, Belgium|Waterloo]], shortly after [[Battle of Waterloo|the battle]], once the corpses had been buried. There, Margaret picked up souvenirs which she showed to Prussian Field Marshal [[Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher|Blücher]] in London.&lt;ref name=BIB/&gt;{{rp|19}}

Neve met with [[Charles François Dumouriez]], a general of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], who dubbed her "la spirituelle".&lt;ref name="neve1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Obituary|pages=10|publisher=[[The Times]]|date=1903-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Margaret married John Neve, born 1779, from [[Tenterden]], Kent,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1903/04/19/101990032.pdf |title=The Late Mrs Neve |work=NY Times |date=19 April 1903}}&lt;/ref&gt; in St Peter Port (Town) church on 18 January 1823. On their honeymoon, they visited the Waterloo battlefield, 8 years after the battle.&lt;ref name="ST03"&gt;{{cite news |title=AGED 110 YEARS |publisher=The Straits Times |date=7 May 1903 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; She lived in England for 25 years of marriage, but when her husband died in 1849, she returned to Guernsey.&lt;ref name="neve2"&gt;{{cite news|title=Her Hundred-and-eighth Birthday|pages=3|work=[[The Pall Mall Gazette]]|date=1900-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had no children.

== Later life and death ==

The census for 1871 shows Margaret A. Neve (78) and her sister Elizabeth Harvey (73) living at 'Chaumière', Rouge Huis, St Peter Port, Guernsey.&lt;ref&gt;RG10-5765-222-1&lt;/ref&gt; Neve traveled abroad to various countries with Elizabeth.  Their last trip was in 1872, when Neve was 80, wherein they visited the Polish city of [[Krakow]] (then part of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]]).&lt;ref name="neve2" /&gt;

On 18 May 1899, a reception was held at [[Rouge Huis]] to celebrate her 107th birthday and her entrance into her 108th year. The town council, [[jurat]]s, the officers of the staff, and about 250 of the leading residents attended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Unexampled Longevity. |pages=21 |work=[[The Pall Mall Gazette]]|date=1899-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite her age, Margaret was found making [[marmalade]] the next morning by a reporter from ''[[The Times]]''. She was reported as never being ill until the age of 105, when she had the flu, followed by bronchitis at 108. At the age of 110, she climbed a tree to pluck an apple, explaining that they were much tastier when eaten straight from the tree.&lt;ref name="BIB"&gt;{{cite book |first=Glen |last=Balfour-Pau |title=Bagpipes in Babylon: A Lifetime in the Arab World and Beyond |ISBN=9781845111519 |publisher=I.B.Tauris, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|18}}

A newspaper report records that she enjoyed a glass and a half of old sherry at lunchtime, followed by a weak whiskey and water at supper. She was in the habit of always rising early and abstaining from eating and drinking between meal times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Oldest Woman in the World |publisher=arence and Richmond Examiner |date=19 February 1901 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to popular belief, she did not receive congratulations from [[Queen Victoria]] congratulating her for reaching her 110th birthday. However, the Harvey family (through Neve's niece Louisa) did exchange correspondence with the Royal Household, expressing gratitude for the signed photograph given to them on 4 May 1896 by the Queen.&lt;ref name="Priaulx" /&gt;

Neve died on 4 April 1903, a month before her 111th birthday. She reportedly repeated a [[Psalm]] in a loud voice the day before she died. Flags in Guernsey were lowered to half mast as a show of respect.&lt;ref name=BIB/&gt;{{rp|20}} She was one of the last few living people from the 18th century.

The '''name-letter effect''' is the tendency of people to prefer the [[letter (alphabet)|letters]] in their [[personal name|name]] over other letters in the [[alphabet]]. Whether [[Human subject research|subjects]] are asked to rank all letters of the alphabet, rate each of the letters, choose the letter they prefer out of a set of two, or pick a small set of letters they most prefer, on average people consistently like the letters in their own name the most. Crucially, subjects are not aware that they are choosing letters from their name.

Discovered in 1985 by the Belgian [[psychologist]] [[Jozef Nuttin]], the name-letter effect has been replicated in dozens of studies, involving subjects from over 15 countries, using four different alphabets. It holds across age and gender. People who changed their names many years ago tend to prefer the letters of both their current and original names over non-name letters. The effect is most prominent for [[initial]]s, but even when initials are excluded, the remaining letters of both [[given name|given]] and [[surname|family names]] still tend to be preferred over non-name letters.

Most people [[self-esteem|like themselves]]; the name is associated with the [[psychology of self|self]], and hence the letters of the name are preferred, despite the fact that they appear in many other words. People who [[self-hatred|do not like themselves]] tend not to exhibit the name-letter effect. A similar effect has been found for numbers related to [[birthday]]s: people tend to prefer the number signifying the day of the month on which they were born. Alternative explanations for the name-letter effect, such as [[mere-exposure effect|frequent exposure]] and early mastery, have been ruled out. In [[Psychological evaluation|psychological assessments]], the Name Letter Preference Task is widely used to estimate [[implicit self-esteem]].

There is some evidence that the effect has implications for real-life decisions. In the lab, people disproportionately favor [[brand]]s matching their initials. An analysis of a large database of charity donations revealed that a disproportionately large number of people donate to [[disaster relief]] following [[hurricane]]s with names sharing their initial letter (e.g. Kate and Kevin following [[Hurricane Katrina]]). Studies that investigate the impact of name-letter matching on bigger life decisions (where to live, whom to marry, which occupation to take on) are controversial.

== Background ==
Systematic interest in the letter preference began in 1959 with [[brand preference|brand-preference]] studies by researchers Mecherikoff and Horton. These tried to find the relative appeal of [[letter (alphabet)|letter]]s for use in package labels.{{sfn|Mecherikoff|Horton|1959||p=114}} In an extension of the studies, [[Human subject research|subjects]] were asked to rank the [[English alphabet]] by the pleasantness of the appearance of [[letter case|capital letter]]s. While there was not a great deal of agreement amongst the subjects (the [[coefficient of concordance|coefficients of concordance]] were low),{{sfn|Horton|Mecherikoff|1960|p=253}} a strong [[positive correlation]] was found between a letter's average rank and how [[frequency of letters|frequently]] it occurred as an initial letter of family names.{{sfn|Alluisi|Adams|1962|pp=124–125}}

[[Robert Zajonc]], a [[social psychologist]], published research in 1968 into preferences between pairs of [[word]]s (e.g. "on" or "off"): in the overwhelming majority of trials the preferred word was also the most common.{{sfn|Zajonc|1968|pp=6–7}} Zajonc also tested preferences for [[nonsense word]]s and found that people liked them the more they heard them.{{sfn|Zajonc|1968|p=24}} He interpreted these results as evidence that [[mere exposure effect|mere repeated exposure]] to a [[stimulus (psychology)|stimulus]] is sufficient to enhance its attractiveness.{{sfn|Zajonc|1968|p=1}}

Around 1977, Belgian [[experimental psychologist]] [[Jozef Nuttin]] was driving on a highway looking at [[license plate]]s when he noticed that he preferred plates containing letters from his own name.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=230}} He wondered if people in general would prefer stimuli that are somehow connected to them; a "mere belongingness" as opposed to Zajonc's mere exposure.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=230}}{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=354}}

== First study ==
In his lab at the [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven]], Nuttin [[Design of experiments|designed experiments]] to test the [[hypothesis]] that people place a higher value on letters that feature in their name.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=230}}{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=354}} It was crucial to the experimental design to rule out other factors, particularly mere exposure. If letters in a name are also letters that occur with higher frequency, then a preference for one's own letters might arise from the mere-exposure effect.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=354}}

To find an effect which ruled out mere exposure, Nuttin created a [[yoked control design]] in which two subjects evaluated the same letters separately. Some of the letters belonged to one subject's name, and some of the letters belonged to the other subject's name, while some were random. In this design, any difference in preference between subjects would have to be based on whether the letter occurred in their name.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|pp=354–355}}

For example, take the fictitious pair Irma Maes and Jef Jacobs as shown in the table. The first stimulus is A and U: the last letter of Irma's first name and a letter not in her name. The next stimulus is M and D: the penultimate letter from Irma's first name and a letter not part of her name. As can be seen in the table this is repeated for the remaining letters of Irma's first name. The letters of her last name then also appear in reverse order, and finally the letters of both of Jef's names. The shading in the table reveals the pattern hidden to subjects, who would have been told to circle their preferred letter of each pair as fast as possible without thinking.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|pp=354–356}}

In the first trial, 38 [[Flemish|Dutch-speaking]] local [[primary school|elementary school]] girls circled the letters they preferred in two yoked lists of letter pairs. A significant preference for the letters of one's own name over those of the other person was found.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=356}} The second experiment used 98 Dutch-speaking local university students, to see if more years of reading made a difference. Four other factors were varied: 1) either pairs or triads of letters; 2) encircling the preferred letter or crossing out the less preferred one(s); 3) the letters QXYZ, infrequent in Dutch, included or excluded; 4) own-name letters presented first or last.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=356}} All conditions gave a name-letter effect, with a stronger effect when QXYZ were included and the less preferred letter was crossed out.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=357}} No [[significant difference]] was found using family name rather than first name or both names.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=358}} While the effect was strongest for initials, subsequent [[data analysis]] revealed a significant effect even without the first and last initial.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=358}}

=== Discussion ===
Nuttin concluded that the experiments showed that, independent of visual, [[psychoacoustics|acoustical]], [[applied aesthetics|aesthetic]], [[semantics|semantic]], and frequency characteristics, letters belonging to one's own first and family names are preferred above other letters.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=358}} He framed the effect in the context of [[narcissism]], [[Gestalt theory]] and [[awareness]], as reflected in the title of his 1985 article "Narcissism beyond Gestalt and awareness: the name letter effect", in which "beyond Gestalt" refers to the fact that subjects were not shown names, only letters in isolation, and "beyond awareness" to the fact that subjects did not realize that the letters of their own names were used.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|pp=358–359}} Nuttin claimed the effect he found was the first to go beyond Gestalt and awareness.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=359}}

== Second study ==
In 1987 Nuttin published his second study, describing experiments done in 1984 and 1985 with the help of Hilde Sas.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|p=381}}{{sfn|Sas|1986}} Because of the far-reaching implications of the name-letter effect for psychological theories, Nuttin found it wise to first test the effect's generality and robustness, before setting off on a research program aimed at understanding the underlying [[affect (psychology)|affective]] and [[cognitive psychology|cognitive]] processes at work. He wondered whether the effect would be found in all cultural and linguistic communities, or whether the first study revealed an effect due to some unknown idiosyncratic aspect of the Dutch language in Belgium.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|p=384}}

=== Method ===
Cross-lingual studies were performed at 13 European universities, using 12 different languages, viz. Dutch, [[English language|English]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Greek language|Greek]] (the only one with a non-[[Latin alphabet|Roman alphabet]]), [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. Because the original yoked design did not lend itself well to long-distance research and standardization, it was replaced by a simpler, easier to replicate experimental design. Subjects were asked to mark the six capital letters they liked most in a randomized list containing all letters of the local alphabet, again without giving it much thought. They had to mark their first preference with 1, their second with 2, etc. The new method was first applied in Belgium. When results showed the name-letter effect at work again, it was copied in the other countries. A total of 2,047 subjects participated, all students.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|pp=385–386}}

=== Discussion ===
Across languages and letters, the average probability of a letter being chosen as one of the six preferred letters was 0.30 for name letters and 0.20 for other letters. The strongest effects were observed in the Norwegian and Finnish studies. In the Hungarian, Portuguese, and Italian studies the effect was present but not to a significant degree.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|p=390}} The effect was also found when only looking at letters in family names, as well as only first name letters. The name-letter effect emerged as very significant in all languages when only initials were considered.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|p=391}} There was a probability of 0.46 that initial letters were chosen amongst the top-six letters. Further analysis revealed that the overall name-letter effect is not simply due to initials: when excluding initials a name-letter effect was still found across all languages.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|p=392}}

Nuttin analyzed the data to see if there was a national-letter effect, but failed to find one. Norwegians did not favor the letter N (for Norge) more than people from other countries did, neither did the Hungarians favor the letter M (for [[Magyarország]]). This led Nuttin to conclude that individual ownership has affective consequences that are not observed for collective ownership.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|pp=396–397}}

The data also allowed for an investigation into whether visual prominence is an important factor in the name-letter effect. Cars in Austria and Hungary have a sticker displaying their nationality with a capital letter that does not match the country's name in the local language (A and H respectively). This did not have any impact on people in those countries liking those letters relatively more.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|p=397}}

As in the first study, the second one also included a task relating to disliking letters. Subjects were asked to select the six letters they liked the least. As before, merely having a letter in one's own name significantly reduced the chances of disliking it.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|pp=397–398}} This task revealed an asymmetry in the letter preference hierarchy. While there was a large consensus within each of the 12 languages as to which letters were least preferred, there was not much consensus at all around the most preferred letters.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|p=398}}{{efn-ua|This asymmetry is similar to what Czapiński found when analyzing school-trip companion preferences: much consensus as to who were the three least preferred students, but little in who were the three most preferred.{{sfn|Czapiński|1980|p=203}}}}

== Reception ==
In the light of how surprising the finding was, Nuttin hesitated for seven years before finally going public with it. He first mentioned it at a conference of the [[European Association of Social Psychology|European Association of Experimental Social Psychology]] in 1984,{{sfn|Nuttin|1984}} followed by the 1985 and 1987 articles referred to above. His work was met with widespread skepticism, as he had expected.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=234}} Loosen, a researcher at Nuttin's own university, called the name-letter effect "so strange that a down-to-earth researcher will spontaneously think of an [[artifact (error)|artifact]]".{{sfn|Loosen|1990|p=11}}{{efn-ua|Loosen's critique stemmed from misinterpreting Nuttin's experimental design. Loosen thought that subjects in the yoked experiments were randomly selected to form a pair. However, this had not been the case. Nuttin had selected pairs based on minimal overlap of syllables in the subjects' names.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=234}}}} Other researchers did not explicitly say that the effect was [[spurious relationship|spurious]], but they doubted its psychological relevance.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=234}} In the first five years after publication (1985–1989), Nuttin's 1985 article was cited only once and the effect was studied at only one other university ([[Ohio State University]], where Johnson replicated the effect using American students).{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=235}}{{sfn|Johnson|1986}}{{efn-ua|Because the effect is most profound for initials, Johnson had christened the effect the ''initial-letter effect''. Nuttin did not agree with this [[reductionism]], saying there is no need to create the illusion of two phenomena where there is only one.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|p=396}}}}

This all changed in 1995, when Greenwald and Banaji pointed out that Nuttin's work was relevant to indirect measurement of self-esteem, which Nuttin himself had actually already suggested.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=234}}{{sfn|Greenwald|Banaji|1995|p=11}} After that the original study was cited 14 times in the five years between 1995 and 1999, 50 times between 2000 and 2004, 114 times between 2005 and 2009, and approximately 200 times between 2010 and 2014.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=234}} The name-letter effect is no longer disputed and Nuttin's work has been called "seminal" by Stieger, Voracek, and Formann in their 2012 meta-analysis of 44 publications on the effect.{{sfn|Stieger|Voracek|Formann|2012|p=63}} Their meta-analysis found no trace of [[publication bias]].{{sfn|Stieger|Voracek|Formann|2012|pp=66–67}}

== Characteristics ==
In her 2014 [[meta-analysis]] of dozens of name-letter effect studies, Hoorens called the effect robust.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=235}} She noted robustness in:

* Scope: The name-letter effect is stronger for initials than for non-initials, but generally still holds even when excluding initials from analysis.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=235}}{{efn-ua| Koole, Smeets, van Knippenberg, and Dijksterhuis found an effect only for initials, not for letters in other positions.{{sfn|Koole|Smeets|van Knippenberg|Dijksterhuis|1999|p=111}}}}
* Gender: All but two studies found the effect equally strong for women and men.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=235}}{{efn-ua|The exceptions are a study by Albers, Rotteveel, and Dijksterhuis, and one by Stieger, Preyss, and Voracek.{{sfn|Albers|Rotteveel|Dijksterhuis|2009|p=63}}{{sfn|Stieger|Preyss|Voracek|2012|p=51}}}}{{efn-ua|Gender-role orientation, the extent to which an individual adopts and displays traits, attitudes, and behaviors normatively identified as male-typical or female-typical, may also play a part in the name-letter effect.{{sfn|Stieger|Burger|Schiller|Schulze|2014|p=358}} It can be measured by the gender initial-preference task, which requires participants to rate letters for their gender typicality. Men have been shown to rate their initial letters as more male-typical, whereas women rate their initials as more female-typical.{{sfn|Stieger|Burger|Schiller|Schulze|2014}}}}
* Age: The effect has been found in people ranging from school children to university students, middle-aged and old-aged adults.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=235}}{{efn-ua|The only known exception is a study by Kernis, Lakey, and Heppner.{{sfn|Kernis|Lakey|Heppner|2008|p=477}}}}
* Culture: Although there are many differences between [[Eastern culture|Eastern]] and [[Western cultures]], including as to how often family names or initials are used, the effect seems to apply across cultures.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=235}} In their study with subjects from Thailand, where the [[Thai name|family name]] is rarely used, Hoorens, Nuttin, Herman and Pavakanun found a much stronger effect for first name than family name.{{sfn|Hoorens|Nuttin|Herman|Pavakanun|1990|p=204}} Kitayama and Karasawa found no special effect for [[Japanese name|initials in Japan]], where name initials are rarely used, but did find an overall name-letter effect.{{sfn|Kitayama|Karasawa|1997|p=740}}
* Language: 15 languages have been tested ([[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, [[Japanese language|Japanese]], Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Spanish, [[Thai language|Thai]]), covering four language families  ([[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]], [[Indo-Uralic languages|Uralic]], [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]], [[Japonic]]) and five alphabets ([[Greek alphabet|Greek]], Roman, [[Cyrillic]], [[Devanagari]], [[Kana]]). In all cases a name-letter effect was found.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=235}}{{sfn|Kitayama|Karasawa|1997|p=740}}{{sfn|Hoorens|Nuttin|Herman|Pavakanun|1990|p=184}}
* Time: In a study on preferences for initials, Stieger and LeBel found that people who had [[Maiden and married names|changed their name after marrying]] continued to show a preference for the initial of their abandoned birth name decades into their marriage. Also, subjects who had been married less than two years already showed a name-letter effect for their new last name initial.{{sfn|Stieger|LeBel|2012|p=10}}

== Explanations ==
Various explanations for the name-letter effect have been explored. Several explanations which seemed plausible at first have since been rejected.

=== Disproved causes ===

==== Mere exposure ====
People may simply like most what they see most. Letters that appear more frequently in everyday usage also occur more often in people's names. Forer, in 1940, and Alluisi and Adams, in 1962, found a positive correlation between the frequency of occurrence of letters and [[phoneme]]s and how attractive they were judged to be.{{sfn|Hoorens|Nuttin|1993|p=181}}{{sfn|Forer|1940|p=589}}{{sfn|Alluisi|Adams|1962|p=123}} Zajonc extended these studies, using foreign symbols and controlling the number of exposures. This led him to formulate the mere-exposure hypothesis: the more you see something, the more you like it.{{sfn|Zajonc|1980|p=151}} Nuttin's original study showed that mere exposure can not be the cause of the name-letter effect, as letters with equal frequency were evaluated differently by people who had the letter in their names and those who did not.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=359}}{{efn-ua|Nuttin made the assumption that for any given letter, total exposure has been roughly the same for each subject. That is, an adult's name is read or written infrequently compared to all other words.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=359}} Other researchers agreed; Greenwald and Banaji spoke of "reaching an asymptote".{{sfn|Kitayama|Karasawa|1997|p=740}}}} He also found that whereas the letter B is of low frequency in French and the letter Q of medium frequency, in experiments with French speakers the B was among the most highly liked letters and the Q was among the least liked. Similarly, in Polish the Y is a medium frequency letter, yet was still among the least preferred letters.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|p=399}} In each of the languages, the least frequent letters were over-represented in the set of least preferred letters, whereas the most preferred letters were rarely the highest frequency letters. The exposure counts in the lab studies done by Zajonc (20 to 25 times) were minuscule compared to real-life observation counts of any letter, which also caused Nuttin to cast doubt on whether Zajonc's theory could hold true in the real world.{{sfn|Nuttin|1987|pp=398–400}}

==== Subjective frequency ====
Subjective frequency is how frequently subjects {{em|think}} a stimulus appears. Name letters may be noticed more and, consequently, assumed to occur more frequently than other letters. Early research into the impact of exposure showed that differences in subjective frequency yielded different results even when the {{em|actual}} frequency was identical.{{sfn|Matlin|1971|p=295}} Hoorens and Nuttin tested whether subjective frequency could be an explanation for the name-letter effect by asking subjects to rank-order the entire alphabet twice, once according to their letter preference and once according to estimated letter frequency. Subjects indeed significantly overestimated the frequency of letters in their names, although there was no significant positive correlation between the overestimation of frequency and the name-letter effect.{{sfn|Hoorens|Nuttin|1993|p=177}} The researchers also asked subjects to rate how much they liked their own name. Subjects who liked their name had a stronger name-letter effect than those who did not like their name, but they did not overestimate the frequency of own-name letters more than subjects who did not like their names. Hoorens and Nuttin concluded that there is no support for the subjective frequency hypothesis.{{sfn|Hoorens|Nuttin|1993|p=177}}

==== Evaluative conditioning ====
[[Evaluative conditioning]] suggests that if the name is liked then the name letters will be liked too. This would occur through repeated visual association of the name letters with the name. Martin and Levey defined evaluative conditioning as a variation of [[classical conditioning]] in which we come to like or dislike something through an association.{{sfn|Martin|Levey|1987|p=69}} Given the observation that our own name stands out among others as quite an attractive stimulus, as Cherry found in the [[cocktail party effect]], it could be that the name-letter effect results from evaluative conditioning.{{sfn|Feys|1995|p=560}}{{sfn|Mack|Rock|1998|p=18}} Feys set up a controlled study with Flemish subjects, pairing unfamiliar symbols (Japanese [[kanji]]) with subjects' own names, and with other names. He found that there was no difference in how much subjects liked the kanji symbol representing their own name or other names. He concluded that evaluative conditioning is not the primary cause of the name-letter effect.{{sfn|Feys|1995|p=560}}

==== Subjective ownership ====
Subjective ownership would occur if subjects knowingly chose the letters from their own name. Nuttin ruled out a conscious response strategy in tests. Despite being given a monetary reward and unlimited time, none of the subjects of his original study were able to find a pattern in the stimulus lists, ruling out the possibility that they knew their own name-letters were there.{{sfn|Hoorens|1990|p=29}}

==== Mastery pleasure ====
The letters first learned by a child, commonly their own name,{{sfn|Treiman|Broderick|1998|p=112}} may come to have lasting positive associations.{{sfn|Hoorens|Todorova|1988|p=366}} Hoorens and Todorova tested this by looking for a name-letter effect in bilingual subjects where their [[first language|mother tongue]] alphabet was Cyrillic and their foreign-language alphabet Roman.{{sfn|Hoorens|Todorova|1988|p=365}} Because learning a foreign language at a later age does not typically involve extra attention given to name letters, there should be no name-letter effect in the foreign-language alphabet, only in the first-language alphabet.{{sfn|Hoorens|Todorova|1988|p=366}} Results of a study with 100 Bulgarian subjects who at a later age learned English, German, French or Spanish revealed a name-letter effect for the Roman alphabet as well as for Cyrillic.{{sfn|Hoorens|Todorova|1988|p=367}}{{efn-ua|The effect was not due to the two alphabets sharing letters. It was found for common letters with identical pronunciation (AEKMT), common letters with different pronunciation (BCFPYU), and Roman capitals not appearing in Cyrillic (DFGIJNRVWZ).{{sfn|Hoorens|Todorova|1988|p=367}}}} The researchers concluded mastery pleasure is not the principal cause of the name-letter effect.{{sfn|Hoorens|Todorova|1988|p=368}} In a follow-up study Hoorens, Nuttin, Herman and Pavakanun tested the strength of the name-letter effect among elementary-school children, in a cross-sectional experimental design involving Flemish and Hungarian second, fourth, and sixth graders. Instead of finding the name-effect to decrease with age as might be expected, they found it increased, thus proving that mastery pleasure is not the principal cause.{{sfn|Hoorens|Nuttin|Herman|Pavakanun|1990|p=190}}{{efn-ua|Other studies have since also found the effect to increase over age, for instance, Corenblum and Armstrong in their study of [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Native Canadian]] children.{{sfn|Corenblum|Armstrong|2012|p=130}}}} They also investigated name-letter effects in bilingual Thai subjects, some of whom had learned the English alphabet at the same time as the Thai alphabet, and others who had learned it later.{{efn-ua|Only Thai [[consonant]]s were presented as stimuli. Thai [[vowel]]s can not be used in isolation as their sound depends on their context.{{sfn|Hoorens|Nuttin|Herman|Pavakanun|1990|p=192}}}} They found that the time at which students had learned the second alphabet made no difference in the strength of the name-letter effect, thereby ruling out mastery pleasure as a co-determinant.{{sfn|Hoorens|Nuttin|Herman|Pavakanun|1990|pp=196–201}}

=== Probable cause ===
The effect is thought to arise from unconscious, automatic processes of self-evaluation, with different research groups coming at it from two different angles.{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=359}}{{sfn|Koole|2007|p=603}}

==== Mere ownership ====
Nuttin frames the cause in terms of ownership, which has roots in [[behavioral economics|economic psychology]]. The [[endowment effect]] has found that people ascribe more value to things merely because they own them.{{sfn|Kahneman|Knetsch|Thaler|1991|p=193}}{{sfn|Beggan|1992|p=229}} Nuttin puts the name-letter effect down to people automatically liking and valuing anything that is connected to them. As such, the name-letter effect is just one example of a more general [[mere ownership effect|mere-ownership effect]].{{sfn|Nuttin|1985|p=359}} In which case, various verifiable predictions follow.

* Most people should like their name. Those that do not should not like their name letters. Hoorens and Nuttin tested this and found that most people rated their name relatively highly. They also found that subjects who evaluated their own name relatively positively liked their name letters more than subjects who evaluated their own name negatively.{{sfn|Hoorens|Nuttin|1993|pp=177–200}}
* Bilinguals using two different alphabets should demonstrate a name-letter effect in both alphabets. A weaker effect should be found in the second alphabet, as names in second alphabets are likely to be less connected to the self. Hoorens and Todorova found that bilinguals with a tendency to like their name letters in Cyrillic also had a tendency to like their name letters in the Roman alphabet. The effect was found to be weaker in the second alphabet.{{sfn|Hoorens|Todorova|1988|p=367}} This was replicated in a Thai-English study by Hoorens, Nuttin, Herman and Pavakanun.{{sfn|Hoorens|Nuttin|Herman|Pavakanun|1990|pp=183–184}}
* Similar effects should be found for other attributes connected to the self, such as the numbers of one's birthday. Nickell, Pederson, and Rossow found that people like the numbers representing the month and year of their birth more. They also found that subjects liked the year of their graduation more.{{sfn|Nickell|Pederson|Rossow|2003|pp=161–163}} In a study of Japanese students, Kitayama and Karasawa found a strong [[birthday-number effect]] for the day of the month, especially for numbers higher than 12. The higher numbers may be more uniquely associated with birthdays, whereas lower numbers could be more saturated with other meanings.{{sfn|Kitayama|Karasawa|1997|p=740}}

==== Implicit self-esteem ====
Another group of researchers has framed the cause in terms of [[social psychology]], specifically the [[self-esteem]] theory. Beginning with [[Anthony Greenwald|Greenwald]] and Banaji in 1995, this group states that the name-letter effect results from [[implicit self-esteem]], a person's tendency to evaluate him or herself positively in a spontaneous, automatic, or unconscious manner.{{sfn|Greenwald|Banaji|1995|pp=4, 10–11}}{{sfn|Koole|2007|p=603}} Most people like themselves.{{sfn|Greenwald|Banaji|1995|p=10}} The halo effect of self-esteem spreads to any attributes associated with the self, including the name and its letters.{{sfn|Greenwald|Banaji|1995|pp=10–11}} As early as 1926 Syz discovered that a person's own name is special compared to others, eliciting physical responses measurable on the skin.{{sfn|Syz|1926|pp=119–126}} It is thought that when a person recognizes the letters in his or her name, that person experiences positive feelings of implicit self-esteem. These positive feelings induce subjects to unknowingly select the letters of their own name, producing the name-letter effect.{{sfn|Koole|Pelham|2003|p=108}}

* To be an automatic process, the effect should, for each specific person, be fairly stable over time. Koole, [[Ap Dijksterhuis|Dijksterhuis]] and van Knippenberg investigated this by asking Dutch students to rate each letter of the alphabet, together with some filler questions for distraction, twice within a four-week period. They found that preferences for name letters did not significantly change between the first and second rating.{{sfn|Koole|Dijksterhuis|van Knippenberg|2001|pp=672–673}} Hoorens and colleagues also found that ratings remained stable when 164 subjects rated letters seven days in a row.{{sfn|Hoorens|Takano|Franck|Roberts|2015|p=910}}
* To be an automatic process, the effect should, like other automatic processes involving preferences, be influenced by deliberate thought. Multiple studies have shown that thinking about feelings inhibits automatic responding.{{sfn|Koole|Dijksterhuis|van Knippenberg|2001|p=673}}{{sfn|Wilson|Dunn|Kraft|Lisle|1989|p=330}} Koole, Dijksterhuis, and van Knippenberg had subjects give their preferences for letters and numbers 1 to 50. They made half of them explain their preferences. They found a name-letter effect and birthday-number effect in those subjects asked to answer without thinking, but no effects in those asked to think. This points to the effect being the result of an automatic process.{{sfn|Koole|Dijksterhuis|van Knippenberg|2001|pp=674–676}}
* Unconscious [[Emotional self-regulation|self-regulation]] has been found to increase under psychological threat. For the effect to be one of unconscious self-regulation it too should increase under threat. Jones, Pelham, Mirenberg, and Hetts found that when people who were high in explicit self-esteem were exposed to a psychological threat, they showed exaggerated name-letter preferences. In contrast, low self-esteem participants showed evidence of the opposite tendency.{{sfn|Jones|Pelham|Mirenberg|Hetts|2002|p=170}} Komori and Murata later replicated this response to threat with Japanese bilinguals who were asked to select preferred letters of the English alphabet.{{sfn|Komori|Murata|2008|p=109}}
* If the effect is an automatic process, then the subliminal use of name letters should influence other preferences. Wentura, Kulfanek, and Greve investigated this by the use of a [[priming (psychology)|priming]] technique. They showed subjects the first and last initials of their own name or of a yoked subject's name, too briefly to be noticed. This was immediately followed by words such as "honest" and "lonely". Subjects had to quickly identify the word they had seen as positive or negative. It was found that subjects categorized positive words more quickly if they were first primed with their own initials. There was no effect for negative words. The effects of initial-letter priming were especially strong for subjects with high levels of explicit self-esteem.{{sfn|Wentura|Kulfanek|Greve|2001|p=657}}{{sfn|Koole|Pelham|2003|pp=101–102}}
* If there is a halo effect spreading to anything connected to the self, then people in relationships should like the name letters of their partners more than other letters. LeBel and Campbell tested this and found a name-letter effect for initials of subjects' partners.{{sfn|LeBel|Campbell|2009|p=1293}} DeHart, Pelham, Fiedorowicz, Carvallo, and Gabriel concluded that the effect applies to parent-child, sibling and friendship relationships as well.{{sfn|DeHart|Pelham|Fiedorowicz|Carvallo|2011|p=127}}

== Application ==
In [[Psychological evaluation|psychological assessments]], the name-letter effect has been exploited to measure self-esteem.{{sfn|Stieger|Voracek|Formann|2012|p=64}} There are two types of self-esteem: explicit self-esteem (a person's deliberate and conscious evaluation of themselves) and implicit self-esteem.{{sfn|Greenwald|Banaji|1995|pp=4, 10–11}} Because by definition implicit self-esteem is not accessible to [[introspection]], measures of it do not rely on direct self-reports but on the degree to which objects associated with the self generate positive versus negative thoughts.{{sfn|Spalding|Hardin|1999|p=535}}{{sfn|Krizan|Suls|2008|p=522}}

The Letter Preference Task is the second-most popular method to measure implicit self-esteem, surpassed only by the [[Implicit-association test|Implicit Association Test]].{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=230}} The task has also been called the Name Letter Preference Task, Name-Letter-Ratings Measure, and Initial Preference Task.{{sfn|Stieger|Voracek|Formann|2012|p=63}}{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=233}} There is no standard method for applying the task. The most commonly used one is a letter rating task, which involves having participants judge all the letters of the alphabet. Even within this method there are variations in the instructions (how much you like the letters or how attractive you find them), in the [[Likert scale|rating scales]] (five-point, seven-point, or nine-point), in the order of the letters (random or alphabetical), and in data collection (paper-and-pencil or computer-based).{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=230}}

There is no standard [[algorithm]] for calculating implicit self-esteem. At least six algorithms are in use.{{sfn|Stieger|Voracek|Formann|2012|p=71}} In their meta-analysis of the name-letter effect, Stieger, Voracek, and Formann recommend using the [[ipsative|ipsatized]] double-correction algorithm (the so-called "I-algorithm"), as originally recommended and named by LeBel and Gawronski{{sfn|LeBel|Gawronski|2009|p=101}}).{{sfn|Stieger|Voracek|Formann|2012|p=71}} In her meta-analysis, Hoorens does not recommend a specific algorithm as little is known about how name-letter preference scores obtained from different algorithms relate to the most important psychometric quality of all, [[content validity|validity]].{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=244}} The algorithms are typically applied to initials only, but can be used for all name letters.{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=234}}

Stieger, Voracek, and Formann recommend that the task be administered twice, that the effects be calculated separately for first-name initial and last-name initial, that the task be accompanied with the birthday-number task, and that the instructions focus on liking rather than attractiveness.{{sfn|Stieger|Voracek|Formann|2012|p=76}} They suggest it may be useful to use not just initials but all name letters for measuring implicit self-esteem, something which Hoorens says is her most important recommendation.{{sfn|Stieger|Voracek|Formann|2012|p=76}}{{sfn|Hoorens|2014|p=248}} The Letter Preference Task has been used to measure implicit self-esteem in contexts as diverse as [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], [[physical health]], [[social acceptance]], [[unrealistic optimism]], feedback sensitivity, [[Emotional self-regulation|self-regulation]], and [[defensiveness]].{{sfn|LeBel|Gawronski|2009|p=86}}

== Wider implications ==
Researchers have looked for wider implications of the name-letter effect on preferences, both inside and outside the lab.

=== In the lab ===
In controlled studies in the lab, Hodson and Olson tried to find evidence of people liking everyday things (e.g. foods, animals) that matched their name initials. No evidence was found, neither for a between-subjects effect (e.g. Judy did not like things starting with J, such as jam, more than Doug liked things starting with J), nor for a within-individuals effect (e.g. Judy did not like jam more than honey).{{sfn|Hodson|Olson|2005|p=1099}}&amp;nbsp;The researchers did discover a small but reliable effect of initials on brand-name preferences within individuals (e.g. Hank did like&amp;nbsp;Honda&amp;nbsp;more than non-matching brands).{{sfn|Hodson|Olson|2005|p=1108}}&amp;nbsp;They speculated that brand names are more likely to communicate identity to others than other everyday things.{{sfn|Hodson|Olson|2005|p=1109}}&amp;nbsp;Stieger extended this research by looking at buying preferences for product names. He found that people were disproportionately more likely to buy products matching their initials.{{sfn|Stieger|2010|p=1089}}&amp;nbsp;The effect mainly occurred for big brands. No correlation was found between the strength of an individual's name-letter effect and the strength of his or her name-letter-branding effect.{{sfn|Stieger|2010|p=1095}}

Wiebenga and Fennis investigated whether the use of the&amp;nbsp;[[personal pronoun]]s&amp;nbsp;"I" and "my" in branding also had an effect on preferences, given the way these pronouns link to the self. They found that brand names with a generic self-referencing pronoun (e.g. [[iPhone]], [[Myspace]]) were evaluated more positively than non-self-referencing brand names (e.g.&amp;nbsp;[[Xbox]]). The effect behaved like the name-letter effect: when the self was put under threat the effect became stronger, and it disappeared for people with negative self-evaluations.{{sfn|Wiebenga|Fennis|2012|p=733}}

A study by Polman, Pollmann, and Poehlman found that sharing initials with members in a group can increase the quality of group work. In a study of&amp;nbsp;[[undergraduate]]&amp;nbsp;students they found that groups sharing initials performed better than groups that did not. Groups that had a higher proportion of shared initials exceeded groups with a lower proportion of shared initials.{{sfn|Polman|Pollmann|Poehlman|2013}}

=== Outside the lab ===
==== Controversial studies ====
Researchers have looked for evidence of the driving force behind the name-letter effect outside the lab. A body of controversial research under the umbrella of&amp;nbsp;[[implicit egotism]], starting with Pelham, Mirenberg, and Jones, has investigated whether people unknowingly make life decisions based on their name letters or name.{{sfn|Pelham|Mirenberg|Jones|2002|p=479}}{{sfn|Pelham|Carvallo|2015|p=692}}{{sfn|Jones|Pelham|Carvallo|Mirenberg|2004|p=665}} &amp;nbsp;Sceptics say that to claim that a name or name letters influences life decisions is an extraordinary claim that requires extraordinary evidence.{{sfn|Danesi|2012|p=84}}

Simonsohn urged researchers to look hard for confounding variables in field data analysis. An example of a confounding variable is baby-name popularity. This has fluctuated significantly over the decades. Simonsohn found that although Walter and Dennis are of near-identical popularity in a large sample of US first names of living people, Walter is a relatively old-fashioned name. He suggested that when Pelham et al. found a disproportionately high number of dentists whose name started with the letters "Den" compared to with "Wal", they had overlooked that people named Walter would tend to be old, and more likely to be retired. Baby-name fluctuation seemed a better explanation for disproportionately more "Den" dentists than "Wal" than implicit egotism.{{sfn|Simonsohn|2011a|p=22–23}}&amp;nbsp;Using both a different data set ([[Twitter]]&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;[[Google+]]&amp;nbsp;accounts) and a different statistical analysis, Kooti, Magno, and Weber found no evidence of people disproportionately having a job matching their name initials.{{sfn| Kooti|Magno|Weber|2014|p=216}}{{efn-ua|Overlooking a cohort confound was also the problem with controversial research that tied initials to death. Christenfeld, Phillips, and Glynn concluded that people who have positive [[monogram]]s (e.g. ACE or VIP) live significantly longer than those with negative initials (e.g. PIG or DIE). This conclusion was based on analysis of thousands of California death certificates between 1969 and 1995.{{sfn|Christenfeld|Phillips|Glynn|1999|p=241}} Morrison and Smith subsequently pointed out that this was an artefact of grouping data by age at death. Frequency of initials changing over time could be a confounding variable. When they grouped the same data by birth year, they found no statistically significant relationship between initials and longevity.{{sfn|Morrison|Smith|2005|p=820}} Similarly, Smith found statistical errors had led Abel and Kruger wrongly to conclude that [[Major League Baseball]] players whose names have positive initials live longer than players with negative initials.{{sfn|Smith|2011|p=211}}{{sfn|Abel|Kruger|2007|p=179}}}}

Dyjas, Grasman, Wetzels, van der Maas, and Wagenmakers criticized the method Pelham et al. used in their analysis of archives of deaths in 23 "Saint cities" in the US, such as&amp;nbsp;[[St. Louis]]&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;[[Saint Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]]. Whereas Pelham et al. pooled all data together and concluded that people gravitate towards cities matching their first name (e.g. Louis or Paul), Dyjas et al. used&amp;nbsp;[[Bayesian network|Bayesian hierarchical modelling]]&amp;nbsp;to show that there are several cities where the opposite happens, people moving away from their name Saint city. They concluded that there is no evidence for an overall effect.{{sfn|Dyjas|Grasman|Wetzels|van der Maas|2012|pp=7–10}}&amp;nbsp;A different set of cities containing 30 surnames, such as&amp;nbsp;[[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]] and [[Johnson City, Tennessee|Johnson City]], did reveal a disproportionately large number of deceased people with city–surname matches.{{sfn|Dyjas|Grasman|Wetzels|van der Maas|2012|pp=8–9}} Dyjas et al. disputed that people gravitate towards cities of their surname, but instead cited Simonsohn's argument that many descendants of founders of these cities may never have moved away, a case of reverse causality.{{sfn|Dyjas|Grasman|Wetzels|van der Maas|2012|p=9}}{{sfn|Simonsohn|2011a|p=15}}

Simonsohn also raised the possibility of reverse causality in the case of Anseel and Duyck's analysis of a large data set consisting of Belgians' last names and the companies they work for. Anseel and Duyck concluded that people tend to choose to work for companies that match their initial.{{sfn|Anseel|Duyck|2008|p=1059}}&amp;nbsp;But Simonsohn suspected that, like&amp;nbsp;[[Walt Disney]] working for [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], many people work for companies named after themselves or a family member. When he controlled for reverse causality in a large US data set, he could not see any evidence for people choosing to work for companies matching their initial.{{sfn|Simonsohn|2011b|p=1087}}

A few controversial studies have linked performance to initials. However, McCullough and Williams found no evidence of a name-letter effect for the letter 'K' in baseball players [[strikeout|striking out]] (shown on the scoreboard with a 'K'), despite an earlier study by Nelson and Simmons suggesting there was.{{sfn|McCullough|Williams |2010|p=881}}{{sfn|Nelson|Simmons|2007|p=1106}} Nelson and Simmons also found that students with first name initials C or D get lower [[Academic grading in the United States|grades]] than others with initials A or B.{{sfn|Nelson|Simmons|2007|p=1106}}&amp;nbsp;Again, McCullough and Williams criticized the statistical analysis used and found no evidence to support such a relation.{{sfn|McCullough|Williams|2011|p=340}}

In response to Simonsohn's critical analyses of their earlier methods, Pelham and Carvallo published a new study in 2015, describing how they now controlled for gender, ethnicity, and education confounds. In one study they looked at census data and concluded that men disproportionately worked in eleven occupations that matched their surnames, for example, Baker, Carpenter, and Farmer, something the&amp;nbsp;''[[New Scientist]]''&amp;nbsp;has coined&amp;nbsp;[[nominative determinism]].{{sfn|Pelham|Carvallo|2015|p=692}}{{sfn|Feedback|1994}} Voracek, Rieder, Stieger, and Swami investigated which way the arrow of causality points when it comes to names influencing choice of occupation. They reported that today's Smiths still tend to have the physical capabilities of their ancestors who were [[metalsmith|smiths]]. In the researchers' view a genetic-social hypothesis appeared more viable than the hypothesis of implicit egotism effects.{{sfn|Voracek|Rieder|Stieger|Swami|2015}}

==== Undisputed studies ====
[[File:Hurricane Katrina August 28 2005 NASA.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Satellite image of a hurricane|upright|[[Hurricane Katrina]]: people with the initial K especially donated to the disaster relief.]]
Research by Chandler, Griffin, and Sorensen into a link between letter names and donations has been widely accepted. They analyzed the records of disaster relief donations after seven hurricanes (among others, [[Hurricane Katrina|Katrina]], [[Hurricane Rita|Rita]] and [[Hurricane Mitch|Mitch]]). They found that people who shared an initial with the hurricane were overrepresented as donors. They concluded that people want to overcome some of the negative feelings associated with the shared name and thus donate.{{sfn|Chandler|Griffin|Sorensen|2008|pp=404–410}}{{sfn|Simonsohn|2011a|pp=44–45}}&amp;nbsp;Simonsohn suggested that implicit egotism only applies to cases where people are nearly indifferent between options, and therefore it would not apply to major decisions such as career choices, but would to low-stakes decisions such as choosing a charity.{{sfn|Simonsohn|2011a|p=46}}

[[File:Navneforandring.jpg|thumb|right|Name change certificate issued by Christian X of Denmark in 1917]]
'''Name change''' generally refers to the legal act by a person of adopting a new name different from their name at birth, marriage or adoption.

The procedures and ease of a name change vary between jurisdictions. In general, [[common law]] jurisdictions have loose procedures for a name change while [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions are more restrictive.

A [[pseudonym]] is a name that differs from the original or true name and does not require legal sanction. It is generally adopted to conceal a person's identity, but can also be done for personal, social or ideological reasons.

==Reasons for changing one's name==
* Marriage or civil partnership. 
* To avoid a [[stalker]] or [[harassment|harassing]] person.
* To choose a surname associated with a hobby, interest, or accomplishment (e.g., old name Henry Schifberg, new name [[Henry Lizardlover]])
* To receive an inheritance conditional on adopting the name of the deceased (this reason was once quite common in landowning families in the UK)
* To replace a frivolous name given by their parents (e.g., old name Mikey Maus, new name Marcus Maus)
* To replace a name which might be considered undesirable with a more desirable one (e.g. old surname Lipschitz, new surname London)
* To dissociate oneself from a former religion (e.g., Ahmed Abdullah to Adel Karim) 
* To dissociate themselves from a famous or infamous person (e.g., old name [[Michael Jackson]] new name Martin Jackson)
* To identify with a famous or infamous person (e.g., old name Simon Johnson, new name Simon [[King Arthur|Pendragon]])
* To dissociate themselves from a family [[Black sheep (term)|black sheep]] (e.g., relatives of [[Adolf Hitler]]).
* To dissociate themselves from an ethnic origin (e.g. changing [[Battenberg family|Battenberg]] to [[Mountbatten]] or Jan Ludvik Hoch to [[Robert Maxwell]]).
* To revert to a former name (e.g., [[Cynthia Lennon]], first wife of [[John Lennon]], after her divorce from later husband John Twist).
* Commercial sponsorship (e.g., [[Jimmy White]] temporarily became Jimmy Brown for [[HP Sauce|HP brown sauce]],&lt;ref name="BBCBrown1"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/funny_old_game/4245973.stm "Jimmy Gets Saucy with Name Change"], no by-line, ''BBC News'' (online edition), "Sport: Fun and Games" section, 8 February 2005; accessed 14 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ashley Revell]] became Ashley blue square Revell for [[The Rank Group]]'s Blue Square service)
* Protest or activism (e.g., old name Jennifer Taylor, new name Jennifer [[Environmentalism|Save the Forests]])
* To change to a fictional character's name, (e.g. old name Tracy Darling, new name [[Tracy Beaker]])
* To make their name more attractive or "catchy" so as to increase their chance of success (see [[Stage name]])
* To change legal name to one used in everyday life, (e.g. where middle name has been used throughout life)
* To better fit one's [[gender identity]] as a [[transgender]] person (e.g., old name Bruce Jenner, new name [[Caitlyn Jenner]])

==United States==
In the United States, [[State law (United States)|state law]]s regulate name changes. Several federal court rulings have set precedents regarding both court decreed name changes and common law name changes (changing the name at will), including ''[[Lindon v. First National Bank]]''.

Usually a person can adopt any name desired for any reason. As of 2009, 46 states allow a person legally to change names by usage alone, with no paperwork, but a court order may be required for many institutions (such as banks or government institutions) to officially accept the change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Julia Shear|last=Kushner|url=https://uclalawreview.org/pdf/57-1-7.pdf|title=The Right to Control One's Name|work=[[UCLA Law Review]]|issue=313|year=2009|pages=324–9}} The states which require a statutory name-change procedure are Hawaii, Louisiana, Maine, and Oklahoma.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the states (except Louisiana) follow common law, there are differences in acceptable requirements; usually a [[court order]] is the most efficient way to change names (which would be applied for in a [[State court (United States)|state court]]), except at marriage, which has become a universally accepted reason for a name change. It is necessary to [[pleading|plead]] that the name change is not for a [[fraud]]ulent or other illegal purpose, such as evading a [[lien]] or [[debt]] or for [[defamation|defaming]] someone else.

Applicants may be required to give a reasonable explanation for wanting to change their names. A fee is generally payable, and the applicant may be required to post legal notices in newspapers to announce the name change. Generally the judge has limited [[judicial discretion]] to grant or deny a change of name, usually only if the name change is for fraudulent, frivolous or [[Morality|immoral]] purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Edward J. Bander, ''Change of Name and Law of Names'' (Dobbs Ferry, New York: Oceana Publications, 1973) Ch. 2&amp;ndash;3.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2004, a [[Missouri]] man succeeded in changing his name to They.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/offbeat/2004-09-23-name-change_x.htm|work=USA Today|title=Missouri man legally changes his name to 'They'}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Minnesota Supreme Court]] ruled that a name change to 1069 could be denied, but that Ten Sixty-Nine was acceptable (''Application of Dengler'', 1979); the [[North Dakota Supreme Court]] had denied the same request several years before (''Petition of Dengler'', 1976).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.court.state.nd.us/court/opinions/9205.htm|title=Petition of Dengler, 246 N.W.2d 758 (N.D. 1976)|work=state.nd.us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In nearly all states, a person cannot choose a name that is intended to mislead (such as adopting a celebrity's name), that is intentionally confusing, or that incites violence; nor can one adopt, as a name, a [[racial slur]], a threat, or an [[obscene|obscenity]].

Some examples of typically allowed reasons for name changes in the U.S. include:
* Adopting a new surname upon marriage (typically the surname of the spouse, a [[hyphenated name|hyphenated surname]], or some combination of parts of both surnames).
* Returning to the use of a prior surname (e.g., a [[maiden name]]) upon divorce.
* Simplification or improved familiarity of spelling or pronunciation.

Under the federal immigration-and-nationality law, when aliens apply for [[naturalization]], they have the option of asking for their names to be changed upon the grants of citizenship with no additional fees. This allows them the opportunity to adopt more [[Cultural assimilation#Immigrant name changing as a form of assimilation|Americanized]] names.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.uscis.gov/files/form/n-400.pdf N-400 Application for Naturalization]", (US Citizenship and Immigration Services, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; During the naturalization interview, a petition for a name change is prepared to be forwarded to a [[United States federal courts|federal court]]. Applicants certify that they are not seeking a change of name for any unlawful purpose such as the avoidance of debt or evasion of [[Police|law enforcement]]. Such a name change would become final if within their jurisdiction, once a [[United States federal courts|federal court]] naturalizes an applicant.

To maintain a person's [[identity (social science)|identity]], it is desirable to obtain a formal order so there is continuity of personal records.

===Informal methods of legal name change===

====Assumed name====
The "open and notorious" use of a name is often sufficient to allow one to use an [[assumed name]]. In some jurisdictions, a trade name distinct from one's legal name can be registered with a county clerk, [[Secretary of State (U.S. state government)|secretary of state]], or other similar government authority. Persons who wish to publish materials and not to be associated with them may publish under [[pseudonym]]s; such a right is protected under [[case law]] pursuant to [[United States Constitution]].

====Usage method====
A common law name (i.e. one assumed for a non-fraudulent purpose) is a legal name.&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.'', ''State v. Ford'', 172 P. 802; ''Bonnie Lee Daniels'', 337 A.2d 49; ''Elizabeth Marie Hauptly'' 312 N.E.2d 857; ''Piotrowski v. Piotrowski'', 247 N.W.2d 354; ''Thomas v. Thomas'', 427 N.E.2d 1009; ''Klein v. Klein'', 373 A.2d 86; ''Stuart v. Board of Elections'', 295 A.2d 223.&lt;/ref&gt; In most states a statutory method, while quick and definitive, only supplements the common law method,&lt;ref&gt;''In Matter of Linda A.'', 480 N.Y.S.2d 996.&lt;/ref&gt; unless the statute makes itself exclusive. Although a person may sue under a common law name.&lt;ref&gt;''Hoffman v. Bank of America'', (M.D. Florida 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[California]] the "usage method" (changing the name at will under common law) is sufficient to change the name.  Not all jurisdictions require that the new name be used exclusively.&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''Kreuter v US'', 201 F2d 33 (true name need not be abandoned), Florida Statute 322.22 (driver's licenses in two names), ''Loser v. Plainfield'', 128 N.W. 1101 (Iowa), ''Ludwinska v John Hancock'', 317 Pa 577 (may be used for just one nonfraudulent transaction).&lt;/ref&gt; Any fraudulent use or intent, such as changing the name to the same name as another person's name, may invalidate this type of name change.

Specifically in California, Code of Civil Procedure § 1279.5 and Family Code § 2082 regulate common law and court decreed name changes. Code of Civil Procedure § 1279.5 (a) reads, "Except as provided in subdivision (b), (c), (d), or (e), nothing in this title shall be construed to abrogate the common law right of any person to change his or her name." Subdivisions b through e preclude one from changing their name by common law if they are in state prison, on probation, on parole, or have been convicted of a serious sex offense. If a person is not in any of these categories, then a common law name change is allowed. (Family Code § 2082 also contains some of the same wording.)

====Preferred name====
Many universities, hospitals, and other institutions allow one to use a "preferred name" instead of one's legal name.  This name can show up on class rosters, online learning platforms, and student [[ID card]]s.  It provides a "transitional"
name change for those who have yet to, or cannot, receive a court-ordered name change.&lt;ref name="UC Davis"&gt;{{cite web|title=Preferred Name {{!}} Office of the University Registrar|url=https://registrar.ucdavis.edu/records/preferred-name.cfm|website=registrar.ucdavis.edu|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Leicester"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a preferred first name or preferred last name? — University of Leicester|url=http://www2.le.ac.uk/offices/hr/policies/ess/Questions/what-is-a-preferred-first-name-or-preferred-last-name|website=www2.le.ac.uk|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Official registration===
A legal name change is merely the first step in the name-change process. A person must officially register the new name with the appropriate authorities whether the change was made as a result of a court order, marriage, divorce, adoption, or any of the other methods described above. The process includes notifying various government agencies, each of which may require legal proof of the name change and that may or may not charge a fee. Important government agencies to be notified include the [[Social Security Administration]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://faq.ssa.gov/link/portal/34011/34019/Article/3749/|title=How do I change or correct my name on my Social Security number card?|work=ssa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bureau of Consular Affairs]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/passport/npic/agencies/agencies_913.html|title=U.S. Passports &amp; International Travel|work=state.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; (for passports), the [[Federal Communications Commission]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://transition.fcc.gov/Forms/Form605/605.html|title=FCC Form 605|author=FCC Internet Services Staff|work=fcc.gov|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140422032207/http://transition.fcc.gov/Forms/Form605/605.html|archivedate=2014-04-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Selective Service System]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sss.gov/regisrantsbk.htm#RegistrantObligations|title=Selective Service System: Registrant Obligations|website=www.sss.gov|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150329020540/http://www.sss.gov/regisrantsbk.htm#RegistrantObligations|archivedate=2015-03-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Department of Motor Vehicles (for a new driver's license, learner permit, state identification card, or vehicular registration). Additionally the new name must be registered with other institutions such as employers, banks, doctors, mortgage, insurance and credit card companies. Online services are available to assist in this process either through direct legal assistance or automated form processing.

Although state requirements differ, it is generally recommended to first register a new name with the Social Security office as some state motor-vehicle departments require updated social security cards to make changes; [[Arizona]] is one of these states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azdot.gov/mvd/faqs/scripts/faqs.asp?section=dl#1|title=Motor Vehicle Services|work=azdot.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most states require name changes to be registered with their departments of motor vehicles (DMVs) within a certain amount of time. For example, [[South Carolina]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scdmvonline.com/DMVNew/default.aspx?n=general_driver_license_information#NameorAddressChanges {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121228092155/http://www.scdmvonline.com/DMVNew/default.aspx?n=general_driver_license_information |date=2012-12-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Wyoming]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://dot.state.wy.us/Default.jsp?sCode=drvna] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070919202553/http://dot.state.wy.us/Default.jsp?sCode=drvna|date=September 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; require a name change be registered with their office within ten days.

The forms, along with the state-specific requirements, can generally be obtained for free.

Many states will require reasons for wanting a name change. For example, in Florida, a court will not grant a petition for a change of name if it finds that (i) the petitioner has ulterior or illegal motives in seeking the name change, (ii) the petitioner's civil rights are suspended, or (iii) granting the name change will invade the property rights (''e.g.'', intellectual property rights) of others.&lt;ref&gt;see, e.g., [http://abcfamilylaw.com/practice-areas/change-of-name www.abcfamilylaw.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101128015829/http://www.abcfamilylaw.com/practice-areas/change-of-name |date=2010-11-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
In the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]], citizens and residents have the freedom to change their names with relative ease.

In theory, anyone who is at least 16 and resident in the United Kingdom can call themselves whatever they wish. However, over the past hundred years or so, formal procedures that are recognized by record holders such as government departments, companies and organizations have evolved, which enable a citizen legally to change the name recorded on their [[passport]], [[driving licence]], tax and [[National Insurance]] records, bank and credit cards, etc., provided that "documentary evidence" of a change of name is provided. Documents such as [[birth certificate|birth]], [[marriage certificate|marriage]] and educational certificates cannot be changed because these documents are "matters of fact", which means that they were correct at the time they were issued.

Documentary evidence of a change of name can be in a number of forms, such as a marriage certificate, [[decree absolute]], civil partnership certificate, [[statutory declaration]] or [[deed of change of name]]. Such documents are mere evidence that a change of name has occurred, however, and they do not themselves operate to change a person's name. Deeds of change of name are by far the most commonly used method of providing evidence of a change of name other than changing a woman's surname after marriage. A deed poll is a legal document that binds a single person to a particular course of action (in this case, changing one's name for all purposes). The term 'deed' is common to signed, written agreements that have been shown to all concerned parties. Strictly speaking, it is not a contract because it binds only one party and expresses an intention instead of a promise. 'Poll' is an old legal term referring to official documents that had cut edges (were polled) so that they were straight.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;[http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/cms/files/deedpolls_notes_0308.doc ''Enrolling a Name Change in the Royal Courts of Justice''.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002143613/http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/cms/files/deedpolls_notes_0308.doc |date=2008-10-02 }} (March 2008).

===England and Wales===
People whose births are registered in England and Wales may have their deed poll enrolled at the [[Royal Courts of Justice]] in London.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; See also [[College of Arms#Change of names]].

====Historical usage====
{{See also|Double-barrelled name#British tradition}}
From the mediaeval age to the 19th century, the era of family dynasties, name changes were frequently demanded of heirs in the last wills and testaments, legacies and bequests, of members of the gentry and nobility who were the last males of their bloodline. Such persons frequently selected a younger nephew or cousin as the heir to their estates on condition that he should adopt the surname and armorials of the legator in lieu of his patronymic. Thus the ancient family otherwise destined to extinction would appear to continue as a great dynasty in the making. Such changes were also more rarely demanded by [[marriage settlement]]s, for example where the father of a sole daughter and heiress demanded that as a condition of his daughter's [[dowry]] her husband should adopt his father-in-law's surname and arms. Thus the progeny of the marriage would continue the otherwise extinct family's name. Such name changes were generally only demanded of younger sons, where an elder brother was available to inherit the paternal estates under primogeniture and carry on the name and arms abandoned by the younger brother. Such name changes were effected by obtaining a private [[Act of Parliament]] or by obtaining a Royal Licence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://deedpolloffice.com/research#royal-licences|title=Researching a past change of name – D•P•O|work=Deed Poll Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; A less radical procedure adopted from the 18th century onwards was for the legator or settlor to demand only that the legatee or beneficiary should adopt his surname ''in addition to'' his patronymic, not in place of it, which gave rise to the "[[Double-barrelled name|double-barrelled]]", even the "triple-barrelled" name, frequently parodied in literature as epitomising the wealthy "[[squirearchy]]" with an embarrassment of inherited estates.

Well known examples are:
*Russell to Gorges (14th century). Ralph IV Gorges, 2nd Baron Gorges, died without issue in 1331. In an effort to preserve his family name and arms he made one of his younger nephews his heir, on condition that he should adopt the name and arms of Gorges. This nephew was William Russell, the second son of his second sister Eleanor de Gorges who had married Sir Theobald Russell (d.1341) of [[Kingston Russell]], Dorset. The event is referred to in one of the earliest heraldic law cases brought concerning English armory, [[Warbelton v. Gorges]] in 1347.
*Smithson to Percy (18th century). [[Hugh Percy, 1st Duke of Northumberland|Sir Hugh Smithson, 4th Baronet]] (1715–1786) (c.1714–1786) in 1740 married [[Elizabeth Percy, Duchess of Northumberland|Lady Elizabeth Seymour]], daughter and sole heiress of [[Algernon Seymour, 7th Duke of Somerset]], and granddaughter of Lady Elizabeth Percy (d.1722), daughter and sole heiress of [[Josceline Percy, 11th Earl of Northumberland]] (1644–1670). In 1740, by a private Act of Parliament,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://deedpolloffice.com/research/private-acts-parliament/1749-23-Geo-2-14|title=Hugh Earl of Northumberland's name and arms. – D•P•O|work=Deed Poll Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smithson changed his surname to Percy and inherited the title [[Earl of Northumberland]] and was later created [[Duke of Northumberland]].

===Scotland===
People whose births are [[civil registration|registered]] in Scotland (or who were adopted in Scotland) can change their name in the same way as people from the rest of the United Kingdom.  However they can optionally apply to the [[Registrar General for Scotland]] to have their birth certificate amended to show the new name and have the respective register updated.

==Other common law countries==

=== Australia ===
Individuals may legally change their name through the [[States and territories of Australia|state and territory]] governments of Australia according to state or territory laws and regulations via agencies generally titled "Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australia.gov.au/information-and-services/family-and-community/births-deaths-and-marriages-registries|title=Births, deaths and marriages registries – australia.gov.au|first=Digital Transformation|last=Agency|website=www.australia.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Exceptions exist for some states such as restricted persons (e.g. jail inmate)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bdm.nsw.gov.au/Pages/change-of-name/change-of-name.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; and in some states, changes may only be made once a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.qld.gov.au/law/births-deaths-marriages-and-divorces/changing-your-name/changing-your-name/|title=Changing your name – Your rights, crime and the law|first=; c=AU; o=The State of Queensland; ou=Communication Services|last=Branch|website=www.qld.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Institutions such as banks,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.austrac.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/cip_form_ind_mar08.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the Passports Office&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.passports.gov.au/passportsexplained/theapplicationprocess/eligibilityoverview/Pages/confirmingidentity.aspx|title=Documents that confirm your Australian citizenship and identity|first=Australian Passports|last=Office|website=www.passports.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; and transport authorities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transport.wa.gov.au/licensing/change-my-name.asp|title=Change my name|first=|last=nw|website=www.transport.wa.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; require proof of identity, so people who change their names need to have proof of the change.

If a person's birth or adoption was registered in Australia, the change will also be noted (in most cases) on the person's birth or adoption registration, and in some states or territories, the name change can be evidenced either through a re-issued [[Birth certificate#Australia|birth certificate]] if born in Australia and/or "Change of Name Certificate".  These certificates are recognised secure [[Identity documents of Australia|identity documents]] and can be verified electronically through the [[Attorney-general of Australia]]'s Document Verification Service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ag.gov.au/RightsAndProtections/IdentitySecurity/Pages/DocumentVerificationService.aspx|title=Document Verification Service|first=Attorney-General's|last=Department|website=www.ag.gov.au|access-date=2017-04-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170321081501/https://www.ag.gov.au/RightsAndProtections/IdentitySecurity/Pages/DocumentVerificationService.aspx|archive-date=2017-03-21|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
In Canada a person can informally call themselves whatever they want. In all provinces except [[Quebec]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.justice.gouv.qc.ca/english/publications/generale/maria-a.htm#names {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123172016/http://www.justice.gouv.qc.ca/english/publications/generale/maria-a.htm |date=2010-11-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; when someone gets married they can change their last name without legally changing their name by using their [[Marriage Certificate]] as verification of the name change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.programs.alberta.ca/Living/5962.aspx?Ns=364+6228&amp;N=770|title=Government of Alberta – Programs and Services – Getting Married|author=Government of Alberta|work=alberta.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is almost impossible for married women in Québec to take their husbands' names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/topics/news/national/story.html?id=72ddc06b-4660-4b92-8b92-3a26ae24b377&amp;k=5969|title=Quebec newlywed furious she can't take her husband's name|work=Canada.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102072805/http://www.canada.com/topics/news/national/story.html?id=72ddc06b-4660-4b92-8b92-3a26ae24b377&amp;k=5969|archivedate=2016-01-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Like the United States, the requirements for a formal name change varies from province to province. Except for [[Ontario]], [[British Columbia]] and [[New Brunswick]], [[Canadians]] must be 18 to change their names and have lived in the province they are changing it in for at least 3 months to a year, depending on province. (In [[British Columbia]], Canadians must be 19 to change their names, in [[Ontario]] and [[New Brunswick]] 16.) People younger than the province's [[age of majority]] can change their names if they have their guardians' consent, are legally married, or have a [[common law marriage]].&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/name-change/how-to.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220124142/http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/name-change/how-to.html|date=February 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; To change a name, a Name Change application must be submitted to either the Ministry of Government Services, Court of justice or Registrar of civil status. A document such as a birth certificate must be submitted. A statement as to why the name is being changed is needed in most areas and the reason has to be serious. In Canada, a name cannot cause confusion, be used for misrepresentation or fraud and in most cases the name change is announced in newspapers. There is a fee involved and it ranges from $10 to $185 depending on the territory or province.&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"/&gt; [[British Columbia]], [[Alberta]] and [[Manitoba]] need [[Fingerprint recognition|fingerprints]] to be submitted before one changes their name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cba.org/BC/public_media/family/161.aspx] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081023224732/http://www.cba.org/BC/public_media/family/161.aspx|date=October 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crcvc.ca/docs/How%20do%20I%20change%20my%20name.pdf|title=How do I change my name?|format=PDF|work=Canadian Resource Centre for Victims of Crime|accessdate=November 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hong Kong===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2010}}
It is a common practice for ethnic Chinese residents of Hong Kong to adopt a western-style English name in addition to their transliterated Chinese name. As they often adopt western-style English names after being registered on the birth register, the fact that they want to include a western-style English name as part of their [[Legal name|legal English name]] is regarded as a name change which usually requires a deed poll.

However, the [[Immigration Department (Hong Kong)|Immigration Department]] which is responsible for processing applications for name change allows applicants to submit such applications without deeds poll; anyone who has a phonetic English name only and wishes to include a western-style English name as part of his or her legal English name can apply to the Immigration Department without a deed poll. Only one application of this kind is allowed for each applicant; any application for subsequent change(s) must be made with a deed poll.

===Ireland===
In the [[Republic of Ireland]], a person earns their name by "use and repute". For most purposes it is enough to simply use the desired name and ask others to call you by that name. For some administrative purposes, such as changing a name on a driving licence or [[Legal aspects of transgenderism#Republic of Ireland|legally changing gender]], a [[deed of change of name]] must be registered with the [[Four Courts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth_family_relationships/problems_in_marriages_and_other_relationships/changing_your_name_by_deed_poll.html|title=Changing your name by deed poll|website=www.citizensinformation.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/birth_family_relationships/changing_to_your_preferred_gender.html|title=Changing to your preferred gender|website=www.citizensinformation.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
From September 1995, [[New Zealanders]] can change their name by making a [[statutory declaration]] and, if approved, the new name is registered with the Births, Deaths and Marriages section of the Department of Internal Affairs (Identity Services). Prior to September 1995, they changed their name by [[deed poll]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dia.govt.nz/diawebsite.nsf/Files/EOIStandard/$file/EOIStandard.pdf Evidence of Identity Standard] NZ Department of Internal Affairs, June 2006, Version 1.0, {{ISBN|0-478-24462-2}}, page 123&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil law==
In general, unlike in [[common law]] countries, names cannot be changed at will in [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdictions. Usually, a name change requires government approval and is only rarely granted, though legal name changes have become more common in some jurisdictions over the last years. The reason given for this system is usually the public interest in the unique identifiability of a person, e.g., in governmental registers, although with the advent of [[personal identification numbers]], that rationale may be in need of reconsideration.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

===Belgium===
In Belgian law, a name is in principle considered fixed for life, but under exceptional circumstances, a person may apply to the Ministry of Justice for a name change. This requires a Royal Decree (French: ''Arrêté royal'', Dutch: ''Koninklijk besluit'') for last names, but only a Ministerial Decree for first names. The new name must not cause confusion or cause damage to the bearer or others. Examples of requests that are usually considered favorably:
* A person of non-European origin who wants to adopt a less exotic name to further his/her integration in Belgian society
* A person stuck with a ridiculous last name that is causing him/her great embarrassment or emotional distress. Actual examples: Salami, Naaktgeboren ("born naked"), and Clooten ("sods of earth" in Middle Dutch, but "testicles" in modern Dutch)
* (for minor children) following legal adoption or recognition of paternity&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.just.fgov.be/nl_htm/informatie/htm_justitie_atotz/naamveranderen.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070514153237/http://www.just.fgov.be/nl_htm/informatie/htm_justitie_atotz/naamveranderen.html|date=May 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazil===
According to the Brazilian Civil Code and the Public Registries Act, the name registered after birth is definitive and immutable. However, there are some circumstances under which a name change is allowed: 
* If an obvious writing error is made while registering the name of the child.  
* In the first year after a person reaches the [[age of majority]] (18&amp;nbsp;years), they can request a change in their first names, but modification of surnames is not allowed.  
* If a person's name exposes them to ridicule and harms their everyday well-being.  
* If a person is recognized publicly by another name, they can request a name change or addition, by providing as support three testimonials of the change in name.  
* If a person has undergone a sex change, recent jurisprudence has allowed name modifications in most such cases.

===India===
In India, the person concerned submits a name change request to an appropriate authority, with supporting documents. Subsequently, an application must be made to the Government Printing Press, which issues an Official Gazette Notification certifying the change of name.&lt;ref&gt;http://goaprintingpress.gov.in/uploads/Change%20of%20Name%20and%20Surname%20Act.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norway===
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2012}}
Although it has always been relatively easy to change one's legal names in Norway, it used to require some kind of government approval. As late as 1830, local vicars were instructed to write both given (Christian) names, as well as last names, in the baptismal record. Earlier, only the given name of the child, birth date, baptismal date, and sex were written down, alongside the parents' names. It was not until the beginning of the 20th century, however, that the authorities required everyone to adopt a family surname. Until about 1980, the government still required that a name change applicant apply to the government regional representative (fylkesmann). The law has been replaced twice since then. Nowadays, the process is as easy as in common-law countries; the subject merely submits the names wanted (providing that the surname chosen is not in use or is not used by fewer than 200 persons) to the local authorities for the purposes of election rosters and census counts; there is no longer an application process.

===Philippines===
2001 RA 9048 amends Articles 376 and 412 of the [[Civil Code of the Philippines]], which prohibit the change of name or surname of a person, or any correction or change of entry in a civil register without a judicial order. Administrative Order No. 1 Series of 2001, implemented the law.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.census.gov.ph/data/civilreg/irr_ra9048.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621060551/http://www.census.gov.ph/data/civilreg/irr_ra9048.html|date=June 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It authorizes the city or municipal civil registrar or the consul general to correct a clerical or typographical error in an entry or change the first name or nickname in the civil register without need of a judicial order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov.ph/data/civilreg/primerra9048.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212183553/http://www.census.gov.ph/data/civilreg/primerra9048.html|archivedate=February 12, 2012|website=census.gov.ph|title= Civil Registration – Primer for RA 9048}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chanrobles.com/republicactno9048.htm|title=PHILIPPINE LAWS, STATUTES AND CODES – CHAN ROBLES VIRTUAL LAW LIBRARY|work=chanrobles.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Name and gender change====
In case of controversial and substantial changes, [[Philippines]] [[jurisprudence]] requires full-blown court [[lawsuit]], that must include the local civil registrar in the petition, since RA 9048 and Rule 108 (Cancellation or correction of entries in the Civil Registry) of the Rules of Court do not allow the change of sex in a birth certificate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chanrobles.com/rulesofcourtspecialproceedings.htm#RULE%20108|title=SPECIAL PROCEEDINGS|work=chanrobles.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only landmark case in the Philippines on name and legal sex change is the Jeff Cagandahan case. The [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]] Justice [[Leonardo Quisumbing]] on September 12, 2008, allowed Cagandahan, 27, who has [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]], to change his [[birth certificate]] name from Jennifer to Jeff, and his legal gender from female to male.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20080917-161148/Call-him-Jeff-says-SC-he-used-to-be-called-Jennifer|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808193038/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20080917-161148/Call-him-Jeff-says-SC-he-used-to-be-called-Jennifer|archivedate=August 8, 2014|title=Call him Jeff, says SC; he used to be called Jennifer|work=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,24359150-401,00.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216041937/http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,24359150-401,00.html|archivedate=February 16, 2009|title=Woman's body 'naturally' became male|work=[[News.com.au]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,423242,00.html|title=Rare Condition Turns Woman Into Man|work=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quebec===
Although as in other jurisdictions residents of [[Quebec]] may informally use whatever name they want, procedures for formal name change are very strict as Quebec (unlike the rest of Canada) operates under a [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] system. The decision must be authorized by the Director of Civil Status, and requires a valid reason for changing the name, including long-term use of the new name (in the Montreuil case cited below, the Quebec appeals court has considered five years' use to be a sufficient reason), difficulty of use due to spelling or pronunciation, or bearing a name that another person has made infamous.

Only a judge may authorize a name change for a child for reasons of abandonment, deprivation of parental authority, or change in [[Paternity (law)|filiation]] such as [[adoption]].

This has occasionally led to controversy. A lawyer named Micheline Montreuil, a non-operative [[transgender]] woman, had to undergo a lengthy process to have her name legally changed. Initially, the director of civil status refused to permit the change on the grounds that a legal male could not bear a female name. According to Quebec law, Montreuil could not change her record of sex because this requires proof of a completed [[sex reassignment surgery]], which she has not had. On November 1, 1999, the provincial court of appeal ruled that nothing in the law prevented a person who was legally male from legally adopting a woman's name. (Montreuil was initially prevented from changing her name despite this ruling on the grounds that she had not established general use, as normally required for a name change; the Quebec appeals court finally authorized the change on November 7, 2002.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.micheline.ca/page034-batailles-e.htm#dictateur|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212004926/http://www.micheline.ca/page034-batailles-e.htm|archivedate=February 12, 2012|title=Micheline Anne Hélène Montreuil and his fights|website=micheline.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Director of Civil Status will amend a Quebec birth certificate if a name change certificate is issued by another province. Some have used that loophole by temporarily moving to one of Canada's other provinces, which follow the more permissive common-law rules, in order to get the legal documents.

===South Africa===
South Africa, which uses a mixture of common law and civil [[Roman Dutch law]], mostly uses common-law procedures with regard to name change. Name changes in [[South Africa]] are regulated by the Births and Deaths Registration Act (Act 51 of 1992, as amended). The personal information of all citizens and permanent residents is recorded on the Population Register, so any name changes must be registered.

A person can change their forenames by submitting a form to the [[South African Department of Home Affairs|Department of Home Affairs]]. An individual's surname, or that of a family, may be changed by applying to the Department and providing a "good and sufficient reason" for the change.

A married woman can change her surname to that of her husband or join her maiden name with her husband's surname, and a divorced woman may return to her previous surname, without applying or paying a fee; but she must notify the department so that the details in the Population Register can be changed. (It is possible that, if challenged, these provisions might be held to be unconstitutional because they apply only to women.)

South Africa has officially recognized same sex marriages since 2006 and in doing so now allows one or both partners to change their surnames in the marriage register on the day of the marriage. A new passport and ID book can then be applied for with the new married surname as well.

The surnames of minor children can also be changed under various circumstances involving the marriage, divorce or death of a parent, children born out of wedlock, and guardianship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.home-affairs.gov.za/personal_amendments.asp ''Personal Amendments.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911222143/http://www.home-affairs.gov.za/personal_amendments.asp |date=2008-09-11 }} (c. 1997). South African Department of Home Affairs. Retrieved May 19, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Switzerland===
In Switzerland, a name change requires the approval of the respective [[Cantons of Switzerland|Cantonal]] government, if there are important reasons (''wichtige Gründe'' / ''justes motifs'') for the change, according to article 30 of the [[Swiss Civil Code]]. When aliens apply for naturalization, they have the option of asking for their names to be changed upon the grants of citizenship with no additional fees.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} According to the case law of the [[Swiss Federal Supreme Court]], such requests must be granted only if the petitioner shows that they suffer substantially from their present name, e.g., if it is the same as that of a notorious criminal.

===Taiwan===
{{Wikibooks|Annotated Republic of China Laws/Name Act}}
In [[Taiwan]], the government strictly regulates when one's surname, given name or both may or may not be changed, under the Name Act (姓名條例) since 1953 with 10 articles, totally amended into 14 articles in 2001, and the [[s:Enforcement Regulations of the Name Act|Enforcement Regulations of the Name Act]] (姓名條例施行細則).

Legally permitted reasons to change one's given name are:&lt;ref&gt;Article 6 of the Name Act (1953) ([[s:zh:姓名條例 (民國42年)|姓名條例 (民國42年)]]), amended into Article 7 of the Name Act (2001) ([[s:zh:姓名條例 (民國90年)|姓名條例 (民國90年)]]).&lt;/ref&gt;
#Having the same name when serving in an institution or studying in the same school.
#Since 1983, having the same name as one's parent, grandparent, or great-grandparent.&lt;ref&gt;Clause 2 of Article 6 of the Name Act (1983) ([[s:zh:姓名條例 (民國72年)|姓名條例 (民國72年)]]), amended into Clause 2 of Section 1 of Article 7 of the Name Act (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;
#Having the same name as someone else who lives in the same county or city and having lived there for at least 6 months.
#Having the same name as a wanted criminal, for example [[:zh:陳進興|陳進興 (Chén Jìnxīng)]], a common name used by not only a convicted kidnapper and murderer who was executed in Taiwan for major crimes in 1997 ([[:zh:陳進興 (台灣罪犯)]]) but also a Taiwanese statesman ([[:zh:陳進興 (台灣政治人物)]]).
#Having special reasons,&lt;ref&gt;Clause 6 of Section 1 of Article 7 of the Name Act (2001) effective 15 October 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; which is limited to twice in one's lifetime, while the second given name change of this type may not be done before reaching adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;Section 2 of Article 7 of the Name Act (2001) effective 15 October 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name change on religious conversion==
{{further|Religious name}}
Adherents of various religions change their name upon [[Religious conversion|conversion]] or confirmation. The name adopted may not have any legal status but will represent their adopted religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Celia Emmelhainz, [http://works.bepress.com/emmelhainz/4/ ''Naming a New Self: Identity Elasticity and Self-Definition in Voluntary Name Changes.''] (c. 2012). Names, Vol. 60, Iss. 3. Retrieved April 4, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism===
* Individuals who attend a ceremony to officially become Buddhists are usually given a new "[[Dharma name]]", which marks their "[[Refuge (Buddhism)|taking refuge]]".

===Christianity===
* It has been historical Christian practice to adopt a name on [[baptism]] or (in some countries) [[confirmation (sacrament)|confirmation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/ce001006.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050428082432/http://www.catholic-forum.com/saints/ce001006.htm|date=April 28, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The customary practice whereby persons entering a [[religious institute]] take on a [[name in religion]] is still observed by [[Eastern Orthodox]] and some traditional [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]]. Eastern Orthodox monastics are usually given the name of a prophet or a monastic saint.
* [[Pope]]s take a [[papal name]] upon their accession to office; for example, [[Jorge M. Bergoglio]] adopted the name [[Francis (given name)|Francis]].

===Hinduism===
There is no formal concept of conversion in Hinduism but converts to Hinduism are accepted, usually after a small ceremony called [[Shuddhi|Shudhikaran]] (purification). Individuals who attend a Shudhikaran ceremony to officially become [[Hindu]] may be optionally given a new [[Dharma]] (religious) name, which is usually based on [[Sanskrit]] or [[Indian name]] such as names based on [[Hindu deities]].

===Islam===
* Converts to Islamic faith may choose a new name; although it is not required, it may in some cases be preferable for personal reasons or because the name is of uncertain Islamicity (e.g. the person converting has a [[theophoric name]] in another religion, such as Christopher or Ganesh). Boxer Cassius Clay's adoption of the name [[Muhammad Ali]] is a well-known example, as is Cat Stevens' change to [[Yusuf Islam]] and Malcolm Little's adoption of the name [[Malcolm X]] and later ''El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz''.  On the other hand, converts may choose to keep their names, as did [[Dave Chappelle]].
*Women do not normally take their husbands' surnames as their own. Their maiden name continues to be their surname even after marriage. Sometimes their husbands first name becomes their surname, similar to the case of surname chains indicating someone's chain of fathers. 
* In Islamic tradition, there are two kinds of [[surname]].
:# The first kind comes from the father's first name, which means that the particular person is the child of. For example, a name such as ''ibn Abdullah'' means "son of Abdullah", or ''bint Abdullah'' means "daughter of Abdullah". Father descendant names can be chained, meaning that an individual can have the name of their father, followed by their paternal grandfather, followed by the father of that grandfather, to indicate a patrilineal lineage.
:# The second kind is associated with [[clan]], [[tribal]] or [[ethnic]] affiliation and is also solely dependant on the person's patrilineal line. In Islamic family law, the individual is required to keep the clan, tribal or ethnic affiliation of their father where it is known, whether the child be illegitimate, staying with their mother after divorce or adopted.
The last name cannot be changed in such a way as to reflect a heritage that is not that of one's biological father.

===Judaism===
* Jewish people in the Diaspora sometimes give their children two names: a secular name for everyday use and a Hebrew name for religious purposes.  [[Conversion to Judaism|Converts to Judaism]] choose a Hebrew name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://judaism.about.com/library/3_lifecycles/names/bl_names.htm|title=Choosing a Hebrew Name – Naming a Jewish Baby|author=Ariela Pelaia|work=About.com Religion &amp; Spirituality}}&lt;/ref&gt; Full Jewish names include a [[patronym]]: converts take the patronym "ben/bat Avraham Avinu" (son/daughter of Our Father Abraham) as converts are held to be spiritual descendants of [[Abraham]], the forebear of Jews.

===Sikhism===
* Those in the [[Sikh]] faith adopt a new last name upon baptism into the [[Khalsa]]. Men adopt the last name [[Singh]], while women adopt the last name [[Kaur]].
* The Sikhs adopted the name Singh in 1699 during the Birth of the Khalsa.

===Wicca===
* Some wiccans have a [[Craft name]] that is used during coven gatherings and rituals.

{{New Netherland}}

The council of '''Nine Men''' was a citizens board and a form of representational democracy in [[New Netherland]]. It replaced the previous councils, the [[Twelve Men]] and the [[Eight Men]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jacobs  |first=Jaap  |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=New Netherland: A Dutch Colony In Seventeenth-Century America |year=2005  |publisher= |quote=Both in the way it was set up and in the extent of its rights, the council of Twelve Men, as did the two later advisory bodies ... | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uex2budtSOUC&amp;pg=RA1-PA136&amp;dq |isbn=90-04-12906-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the council were elected in 1647, 1649, 1650 and 1652. On July 26, 1649, eleven current and former members of the board signed the ''Petition of the Commonality of New Netherland'', which requested that the States General take action to encourage [[economic freedom]] and force local government like that in the Netherlands, removing the colony from the control of the [[Dutch West India Company]]. It became the basis for the municipal government when the city of [[New Amsterdam]] received its charter in 1653.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web   | title = About the City Council   | publisher = New York City Council   | date =    | url = http://www.council.nyc.gov/html/about/history.shtml   | accessdate = 2013-01-01   | deadurl = yes   | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120620053608/http://www.council.nyc.gov/html/about/history.shtml   | archivedate = 2012-06-20   | df =    }} &lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2861">The '''Ogoni Nine''' were a group of nine activists from the [[Ogoni]] region of [[Nigeria]] who opposed the operating practices of the Royal Dutch Shell oil corporation. Their members included outspoken author and playwright [[Ken Saro-Wiwa]], Saturday Dobee, Nordu Eawo, Daniel Gbooko, Paul Levera, Felix Nuate, Baribor Bera, Barinem Kiobel, and John Kpuine (Tripathi, p.189), who were executed by [[hanging]] in 1995 by the military dictatorship of General [[Sani Abacha]] and buried in [[Port Harcourt Cemetery]].&lt;ref name="cemetery1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/450161/NIGERIAS-MILITARY-LEADERS-HANG-PLAYWRIGHT-AND-8-OTHER-ACTIVISTS.html?pg=all|title=Nigeria's Military Leaders Hang Playwright And 8 Other Activists|work=Deseretnews.com|publisher=Deseret News Publishing Company|date=1995-11-11 |accessdate=2014-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The executions provoked international condemnation and led to the increasing treatment of Nigeria as a [[pariah state]] until General Abacha's mysterious death in 1998. Saro-Wiwa had previously been a critic of the [[Royal Dutch Shell]] oil corporation, and had been imprisoned for a year prior to the executions in November 1995.

At least two witnesses who testified that Saro-Wiwa was involved in the murders of the Ogoni elders later recanted, stating that they had been bribed with money and offers of jobs with Shell to give false testimony – in the presence of Shell’s lawyer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiwavshell.org/the-case-against-shell/ The Case Against Shell] &lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, the [[Center for Constitutional Rights]] sued Shell for its complicity in human rights abuses against the Ogoni people, such as colluding with the Nigerian government to bring about the arrest and execution of the Ogoni Nine. In June 2009, on the eve of trial, the parties agreed to a settlement providing a total of $15.5 million to compensate the plaintiffs, establish a trust for the benefit of the Ogoni people, and cover some of the legal costs and fees associated with the case.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Phillips, [http://activistdefense.wordpress.com/2013/11/10/today-we-remember-the-ogoni-nine-executed-for-struggling-against-shell-in-nigeria/ "Today We Remember the Ogoni Nine, Executed for Struggling Against Shell in Nigeria"], Activist Defense, November 10, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3722">'''Philip Bellino''' and '''Edward Gertson''' (both died May 9, 1947) were the last persons [[capital punishment|executed]] by [[Massachusetts]].

==The murder==

Bellino and Gertson were two gangsters convicted of [[murder]]ing nineteen-year-old Robert "Tex" Williams, a former [[U.S. Marine]]. On August 3, 1945, Williams led Bellino, Gertson and Charles Mantia to a [[New Hampshire]] [[summer camp]]. He had learned there would be an illegal dice game taking place in the camp. The four men would rob the players at gunpoint. Williams had lured his accomplices with a promise of easily stealing up to $10,000. Instead they escaped with "a few hundred dollars".&lt;ref name = rogers&gt;Alan Rogers, [http://www.bc.edu/schools/law/lawreviews/meta-elements/journals/bctwj/22_2/02_TXT.htm "Success—At Long Last: The Abolition of the Death Penalty in Massachusetts, 1928–1984"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The trio was enraged at Williams. They also feared the younger man could squeal on them to the police. On August 7, 1945, the four of them shared a taxi ride in the vicinity of [[Boston]]. The taxi stopped at an isolated location, not far from the shore. Williams, Bellino and Gertson stepped out for a walk. Mantia waited in the taxi with the cab driver. Bellino and Gertson returned without Williams, claiming the young man would spend his night with a girlfriend.&lt;ref name = rogers/&gt;

Williams' corpse was soon after discovered. He had been shot in the back of the head. Mantia was the one to lead the police to Bellino and Gertson. James Salah, the cab driver, also became a witness for the prosecution. On June 18, 1946, the duo were found guilty of first-degree murder in a trial by jury. There were originally 14 jurors. Two of them had been dismissed prior to the final verdict. A legal argument that this violated the rights of the defendants was eventually rejected by the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]]. A "mercy bill" discussed at the time in the [[Massachusetts General Court]] could have proven beneficial to the duo, but was vetoed by [[Robert F. Bradford]], [[List of Governors of Massachusetts|Governor of Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name = rogers/&gt;

==Execution and abolition of death penalty in Massachusetts==
Both Bellino and Gertson were executed in the [[electric chair]] at the [[Massachusetts State Prison at Charlestown]] shortly after midnight on the night of May 8–9, 1947.

On April 3, 1951, Massachusetts enacted a "mercy bill" which removed the mandatory death sentence for murder in all cases except for murder committed in the course of rape or attempted rape. No further executions were carried out and in 1984 the [[Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts]] ruled that capital punishment violated the [[constitution of Massachusetts|state constitution]].

A '''posthumous name''' is an honorary name given to royalty, nobles, and sometimes others, in [[East Asia]] after the person's death, and is used almost exclusively instead of one's personal name or other official titles during their life. The posthumous name is commonly used when naming royalty of [[Table of Chinese monarchs|China]], [[List of Korean monarchs|Korea]], [[List of Vietnamese monarchs|Vietnam]], and [[emperors of Japan|Japan]].

Posthumous names in China and Vietnam were also given to honor lifetime accomplishments of many people who did not have hereditary titles &amp;ndash; for example, to successful courtiers.

A posthumous name should not be confused with the [[era name]] and [[temple name]].

==Use==
The posthumous name consists of one or more adjectives inserted before the ruler's current title. As rulers from different states might share the same posthumous name, but rulers ''within'' a state would usually not repeat an already used name, the name of the state or domain is usually also given to avoid ambiguity. In Chinese the whole construct is therefore "[state][adjective][title]", which in English is typically translated as "[title][adjective] of [state]", such as [[King Wen of Zhou]], [[Duke Mu of Qin]], and [[King Cheng of Chu]]. The literal meaning of the adjective is normally not translated.

While the names of living Chinese can be just about any combination of characters, the posthumous name was chosen from a rather small pool of stock characters; the literal meaning of which eroded as a result.

== History ==

===Origins===
Early mythological rulers such as [[Emperor Yao]] are considered to have posthumous names.&lt;ref&gt;''Yiwen Leiju'', vols. [[:zh:s:藝文類聚/卷014|014]]&lt;/ref&gt; All rulers of [[Shang Dynasty]] are known only by their posthumous names, as their personal names were not recorded in classical texts.

Archaeological discoveries have shown that early kings of the [[Zhou dynasty]], such as [[King Wen of Zhou|King Wen]] and [[King Wu of Zhou|King Wu]], used "posthumous names" during their lifetime, but later they became chosen by successors after the ruler's death. As a result, final rulers of states and rulers seen as illegitimate (such as usurpers) often do not have posthumous names and are referred to by their personal names, e.g. [[Jian, King of Qi]]; [[Min, Marquis of Jin]]; and [[Chen Tuo]].

The use of posthumous names was stopped in the [[Qin Dynasty]], because [[Qin Shi Huang]] proclaimed that it is disrespectful for the descendants, or "later emperors" to judge their elders, or the "prior emperors" (先帝). The practice was revived in the [[Han Dynasty]] after the demise of Qin.

===Decline in use===
Posthumous names are the conventional way of referring to rulers from the Zhou dynasty to the Sui dynasty. In the Zhou dynasty the posthumous name was usually only one character, such as "Wen" (cultured) or "Wu" (martial). However, as time went on rulers began to add more and more characters to the posthumous names of their ancestors. By the time of the [[Emperor Gaozu of Tang|first emperor of Tang]] the length had grown to 7 characters, which was taxing to pronounce or write. Therefore, emperors from Tang on are commonly referred to by either their [[temple name]] (Tang through Yuan dynasties) or [[era name]] (Ming and Qing dynasties), both of which are always just two characters long and therefore easy to remember and use.

===Later developments===

Posthumous names commonly made tracing linear genealogies simpler and kept a blood line apparent. The rule was also followed by non-[[Han Chinese]] rulers of [[Sixteen Kingdoms]], [[Silla]], [[Japan]], [[Kingdom of Nanzhao]], [[Liao dynasty]], [[Vietnam]], [[Western Xia]], [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin dynasty]], [[Yuan dynasty]] and [[Qing dynasty]]. King names of [[Hồng Bàng dynasty]] and [[List of legendary monarchs of Korea#Mahan|Mahan]] also followed the rule but they are thought to be later work.

Some rulers, such as [[Wu Zetian]], or rebel leaders also had similar style [[regnal name]]s when they were alive.

Most monarchs inherited the throne and did not give bad posthumous names to the previous monarch. Some names were lengthened or changed by later monarchs. [[Emperor Aizong of Jin]] and [[Chongzhen Emperor]] had different names from different people. [[Qin Hui (Song dynasty)|Qin Hui]], of the Song dynasty, had a good name, was given a bad one, and had the good name later restored.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/xhfk/2010-08/11/c_12433570.htm 韩侂胄——《宋史》中的一缕冤魂]&lt;/ref&gt; After the Song dynasty few received bad names.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncue.edu.tw/~ccource/data/12.doc 從文臣諡號看明清諡法理論，宋秉仁] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930152451/http://www.ncue.edu.tw/~ccource/data/12.doc |date=2007-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bad monarchs of the [[Joseon dynasty]] did not receive posthumous names.

Emperors of China continued to receive posthumous names of increasing length as a matter of ritual long after the naming convention had been abandoned in casual speech and writing. The [[Guangxu Emperor]], who died in 1908 and was the last emperor to receive a posthumous name, sports the impressive 21-character title of "Emperor Tongtian Chongyun Dazhong Zhizheng Jingwen Weiwu Renxiao Ruizhi Duanjian Kuanqin Jing of Qing".

[[Puyi]], the last emperor of China, did not receive a posthumous name upon his death in 1967 since he died at the height of the [[Cultural Revolution]], when such practices would have been thought feudal.

Use of posthumous names ceased in China with the [[Guangxu Emperor]] (d.1908), in Vietnam with the [[Khải Định|Khải Định Emperor]] (d.1925) and in Korea with the [[Sunjong of Korea|Yunghui Emperor]] (d.1926). However, in Korea unofficial posthumous names were given to [[Crown Prince Euimin]] and [[Gu, Prince Imperial Hoeun]].

===Contemporary Japanese use===
Posthumous names are in use to this day in Japan. A deceased emperor is given a posthumous name, which beginning with [[Emperor Meiji]] (d.1912) is identical to his era name and therefore always two characters long. The most recently conferred posthumous name is that of [[Hirohito|Emperor Showa]] (d.1989).

A non-royal deceased person may be given a posthumous [[Dharma name|Buddhist name]] known as ''kaimyo'', but is in practice still referred to by the living name.

==Guidelines==

===Selection===
Posthumous names can be praises (褒字) or deprecations (貶字). There are more praises than deprecations, so posthumous names are also commonly called ''respectful names'' (尊號 zūn hào) in Chinese. [[Sima Qian]]'s ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' outlines extensively the rules behind choosing the names.&lt;ref&gt;明朱睦《易学识遗》辑古谥法十二家，曰《史记谥法解》，曰《周书谥法》，曰《蔡邕独断谥法》，曰《苏洵谥法》，曰《周公谥法》，曰《春秋谥法》，曰《广谥法》，曰《沈约谥法》，曰《贺琛谥法》，曰《扈蒙谥法》，曰《郑樵谥法》，曰《陈思谥法》&lt;/ref&gt; Some of those guidelines:

* Praises
** Those having a persistent and reasonable governance (剛強直理) are called "Martial" (武 wǔ). (This is one of the most honourable names.)
** Those who sympathize with the people and recognize their needs (憫民會椅) are called "Civil" (文 wén). (This is one of the most honourable names.)
** Those who respect the talented and value righteousness (尊賢貴義) are called "Reverent" (恭 gòng).
** Those who are kind and benevolent in nature (溫柔賢善) are called "Benign" (懿 yì).
** Those who aid the people out of righteousness (由義而濟) are called "Admirable" (景 jǐng).
** Those who treat the people compassionately with a gentle quality (柔質慈民) are called "Compassionate" (惠 huì).
** Those who eliminate destructions and purge cruelty (除殘去虐) are called "Tang" (湯 tāng). Possibly named after the revered ruler [[Cheng Tang]] (成湯), the founder of the [[Shang Dynasty]].
** Those who make the people feel satisfied with their policies (安民立政) are called "Constructive" (成 chéng). Again, possibly named after Cheng Tang.
** Those who are considerate and far-sighted (果慮果遠) are called "Brilliant" (明 míng).
** Those who preach their virtue and righteousness to the people (布德執義) are called "Majestic" (穆 mù).
** Those who are aggressive to expand their realm (辟土服遠) are called "Exploratory" (桓 huán).
** "Highly (respected)" (高 gāo) is particularly reserved for the founders of dynasties.
* Deprecations
** Those who lived short lives without much accomplishment (短折不成) are called "Passed Away Prematurely" (殤 shāng).
** Those who have a constant twinge of [[depression (mood)|depression]] (often due to political plights) during their governance (在國遭憂) are called "Pitiful" (愍 mǐn).
** Those who lose their spouses and pass away at their early age (蚤孤短折) are called "Lamentable" (哀 āi).
** Those who are obliged to make sacrifices to their ancestors (肆行勞祀) are called "Mournful" (悼 dào). 
&lt;!---   ** Those who are () are called "" ( ). --&gt;

However, most of these qualifications are subjective, repetitive, and highly [[stereotypical]]; hence the names are chosen somewhat arbitrarily. Such names are usually given by court historians, according to their good deeds or the bad ones.

When combining an emperor's temple name and posthumous name, the temple name is placed first. For example, the [[Shunzhi Emperor]] whose full posthumous name would be "Shi Zu - Zhang Huang Di" (世祖章皇帝), combining the last 2 characters of his temple name and the last 3 of his posthumous name, which is the form most commonly seen in old documents. A fuller description of this naming convention for royalty appears in the [[Chinese sovereign]] entry. The posthumous names of some monarchs and royal members were long, for example [[Hongwu Emperor]], [[Nurhaci]], [[:zh:朝鮮文祖|Crown Prince Hyomyeong]], [[Sunjo of Joseon]] and [[Empress Dowager Cixi]].

Some monarchs did not follow these guidelines. Some monarchs of [[Ju (state)|Ju]], [[Chu (state)|Chu]], and [[Qi (Henan)|Qi]] used place names. Some monarchs of [[Yue (state)]] had Chinese transliterated posthumous names. Some monarchs of [[Goguryeo]], [[Silla]] and [[Baekje]] had different style posthumous names. Some early Japan monarchs also had Japanese-style posthumous names (和風諡号).

==China==

===Emperors and empresses===

All Chinese posthumous names for rulers end in one or two of the [[Chinese character|characters]] for "[[emperor of China|emperor]]", ''Huángdì'' (皇帝, i.e. emperor), which can be shortened to ''Dì''; except about a dozen or so less recognized ones who have had only ''Dì'' and no ''Huáng''.

Starting with Emperor [[Emperor Wen of Han|Xiaowen of Han]] (more commonly "Emperor Wen"), every single Han emperor, except the first one of the Eastern Han Dynasty, has the character of "[[filial piety|filial]]" (孝 xiào) at the beginning of his posthumous names. "Filial" is also used in the full posthumous names of virtually all emperors and empresses of the [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]], [[Song Dynasty|Song]], [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] Dynasties. For Qing emperors, 孝 xiào is placed in various position in the string of characters, while those Qing empresses who were given posthumous names, 孝 xiào is always initial.

The number of characters in posthumous names was increasing. The emperors of the [[Tang Dynasty]] have names in between seven and eighteen characters. Those in the [[Qing Dynasty]] have twenty-one characters. For instance, that of the [[Shunzhi Emperor]] was "The Emperor of Order who Observes the Heavenly Rituals with a Solemn Fate, Destined to Unify, Establishes with Extreme Talented Insights, Admires the Arts, Manifests the Might, with Great Virtue and Vast Achievement, Reaches Humanity, Purely Filial" (體天隆運定統建極英睿欽文顯武大德弘功至仁純孝章皇帝,  {{Audio|Chinese-Emperor Shunzhi posthumous name.ogg|Listen to pronunciation}}: tǐ tiān lóng yùn dìng tǒng jiàn jí yīng ruì qīn wén xiǎn wǔ dà dé hóng gōng zhì rén chún xiào zhāng huáng dì).

The woman with the longest posthumous name is [[Empress Dowager Cixi]], who is "The Empress who is Admirably Filial, Initiates Kindness, with Blessed Health, Manifests Much Contentment, Solemn Sincerity, with Longevity, Provides Admiration Prosperously, Reveal Adoration, Prosperous with a Merry Heaven, with a Holy Appearance" (孝欽慈禧端佑康頤昭豫莊誠壽恭欽獻崇熙配天興聖顯皇后 xiào qīn cí xǐ duān yòu kāng yí zhāo yù zhuāng chéng shòu gōng qīn xiàn chóng xī pèi tiān xīng shèng xiǎn huáng hòu), or 孝欽顯皇后 for short.

===Imperial family===

According to the noble system since the [[Zhou Dynasty]], the immediate family members of the Emperor were given the titles of Kings (or Princes), Dukes, Earls, etc., with or without actual control over a region of land. After their death, they would be referred to by the same title, with the posthumous name (usually one character) inserted in the middle. The characters used are mostly the same ones used for emperors, with the same denotations as described above. For example, [[Prince Gong (Qing dynasty)|Prince Gong]] of the [[Qing Dynasty]] was posthumously named Zhong (忠), and thus is referred to as Prince Gongzhong (恭忠親王 Gongzhong qīnwáng); [[Yixuan, Prince Chun|Prince Chun]] was posthumous named Xian (賢), hence is referred Prince Chunxian (醇賢親王 Chunxian qīnwáng).

===Officials===
It was also common for persons with no hereditary titles, especially accomplished scholar-officials or ministers, to be given posthumous names by the imperial court. The characters used are mostly the same ones used for emperors, with the same denotations as described above. The length, however, was restricted to one or two characters. The posthumous name is sometimes rendered [[canonization]] in English, for the scholar-official to Confucianism is analogous to the saint in the Catholic Church, though the process is not nearly as long. See [[List of Posthumous Names]] for some examples.

[[Confucius]] has been given long posthumous names in almost every major dynasty. One of the most commonly used was Zhìshèngxiānshī 至聖先師.

Sometimes a person is given a posthumous name not by the court, but by his own family or disciples. Such names are private posthumous names (Sĩshì, 私諡). For example, [[Tao Yuanming|Tao Qian]] was given ''Sishi'' Jìngjié 靖節.

==Japan==
In Japan, posthumous names are called ''shigō'' (諡号), ''okuri-na'' (諡), or ''tsuigo'' (追号). Those of Japanese emperors are also sometimes called ''teigō'' (帝号, "emperor name[s]").

There are two styles in emperors' posthumous names, namely Chinese style and Japanese style. In addition to the appellation ''Tennō'' (天皇, "heavenly sovereign", usually translated as ''Emperor'') that is a part of all Japanese emperors' posthumous name, most of them consist of two [[kanji]] characters, although a few consist of three. Some names are given several generations later—this is the case for [[Emperor Jimmu]] and [[Emperor Antoku]], for example. Others are given immediately after death, like that of [[Emperor Monmu]].

Many have Chinese-style names, for example:
* [[Emperor Jimmu]] (神武天皇 ''Jinmu Tennō'', lit. ''Divine Might'')
* [[Emperor Nintoku]] (仁徳天皇 ''Nintoku Tennō'', lit. ''Humane  Virtue'')
* [[Emperor Ōjin]] (応神天皇 ''Ōjin Tennō'', lit. ''Answering the Gods'')

Some have Japanese-style names. For example:
* those who were named after the place where the emperor was born, lived or frequented:
** [[Emperor Saga]] (嵯峨天皇 ''Saga Tennō''), named after a [[palace]] (院 ''in'')
** [[Emperor Ichijo|Emperor Ichijō]] (一条天皇 ''Ichijō Tennō''), named after an official residence (邸 ''tei'')
** [[Emperor Kōmyō]] (光明天皇 ''Kōmyō Tennō''), named after a [[temple]]
** [[Emperor Higashiyama]] (東山天皇 ''Higashiyama Tennō''), named after a [[hill]]
* those who were named after an emperor whose admirable characteristics resemble those of an earlier one by adding ''Go'' (後, lit. ''latter'') as a prefix to the earlier emperor's name:
** [[Emperor Go-Ichijo|Emperor Go-Ichijō]]  (後一条天皇 ''Go-Ichijō Tennō'')
** [[Emperor Go-Daigo]] (後醍醐天皇 ''Go-Daigo Tennō'')
** [[Empress Go-Sakuramachi]] (後桜町天皇 ''Go-Sakuramachi Tennō'')
* those who were named by combining the characters from two previous emperors' names:
** [[Empress Genmei|Empress Gen'''mei''']] (元明天皇 ''Genmei Tennō'') + [[Empress Genshō|Empress Gen'''shō''']] (元正天皇 ''Genshō Tennō'') = [[Empress Meishō|Empress '''Meishō''']] (明正天皇 ''Meishō Tennō'')
** [[Empress Kōken|Empress '''Shō'''toku]] (称徳天皇 ''Shōtoku Tennō'') + [[Emperor Kōnin|Emperor '''Kō'''nin]] (光仁天皇 ''Kōnin Tennō'') = [[Emperor Shōkō|Emperor '''Shōkō''']] (称光天皇 ''Shōkō Tennō'')

Since the death of [[Emperor Meiji]] (明治天皇 ''Meiji Tennō'') in 1912, the posthumous name of an emperor has always been the name of his [[Japanese era name|era]].  For example, after his death, [[Hirohito]] (by which he is usually called outside Japan) was formally renamed '''Emperor Shōwa''' (昭和天皇 ''Shōwa Tennō'') after [[Shōwa period|his era]]; Japanese now refer to him by only that name. ''Hirohito'' was his given name; most Japanese never refer to their emperors by their given names, [[Naming taboo#In other countries|as it is considered disrespectful]].

==Korea==
In [[Korea]], [[Goguryeo]] kings were mostly given posthumous names after their burial places, or in case of [[Gwanggaeto of Goguryeo|Gwanggaeto]], the name described his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/Article.aspx?aid=3006407|title=Of tombs and posthumous names|date=2015-07-09|accessdate=2016-06-03|publisher=[[Korea JoongAng Daily]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Presidential Standard of Pakistan (1956-1967).svg|thumb|right|200px|Presidential Standard (1956-1967)]]

The '''Presidential Standard of Pakistan''' is the official flag of the [[President of Pakistan]].

== Design ==

The Presidential Standard consists of the background of the [[Flag of Pakistan]] with the gold Presidential Crest replacing the white crescent and star found in the Flag of Pakistan. The Presidential Crest consists of a smaller crescent and star flanked by wheat branches with the words "Pakistan" written in Urdu underneath.

== Use ==

The Presidential Standard is displayed only in the presence of the President of Pakistan, particularly in the office and official residence of the President of Pakistan. It is always displayed alongside the Flag of Pakistan. It is also flown alongside the Flag of Pakistan in the Presidential motorcade. The Presidential Standard is never flown atop any building.

== History ==

The Presidential Standard was first adopted in 1956 and has since been redesigned twice: in 1974 and 1998.

'''Qutalmish''' ({{lang-1ca|قُتَلمِش}}, {{lang-fa|قتلمش}}) (alternative spellings: '''Qutulmush''', '''Kutalmish''', {{lang|tr|'''Kutalmış'''}}) was a Turkic prince who was a member of Seljukid house in the 11th century. His son [[Suleiman ibn Qutulmish|Kutalmışoglu Suleiman]], founded the [[Sultanate of Rum]] in what is now Turkey.

==Sultanate of Rûm==
Kutalmish was the son of [[Arslan Yabgu]] and a cousin of [[Tughril]] and played a vital role in the conquests of the [[Seljuq Turks]]. In 1046, he was sent with an army by Tughril to force back the Byzantine army at Ganja and was victorious.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Sicker, ''The Islamic World in Ascendancy: From the Arab Conquests to the Siege of Vienna'', (Greenwood Publishing, 2000), 53.&lt;/ref&gt; 

He supported a rebellion against Tughril and contested the succession to the throne with [[Alp Arslan]]. (''see'' [[Battle of Damghan (1063)]]) According to the historian [[Ali ibn al-Athir]], Kutalmish knew the sciences of the stars.&lt;ref&gt;''Institutionalisation of Science in the Medreses of pre-Ottoman and Ottoman Turkey'', Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu, '''Turkish Studies in the History and Philosophy of Science''', Ed. Gürol Irzik and Güven Güzeldere, (Springer, 2005), 267.&lt;/ref&gt; His son, [[Suleiman ibn Qutulmish|Suleiman]], was recognized as Sultan of [[Sultanate of Rûm|Rûm]] by [[Malik Shah I]] in 1084.&lt;ref&gt;Köprülü, Mehmed Fuad.

The '''royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom''', or the '''Royal Arms''' for short, is the official [[coat of arms]] of the [[British monarch]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/Symbols/Coatsofarms.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=17 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130308050901/https://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/Symbols/Coatsofarms.aspx |archivedate=8 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;p. 10, [https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/362346/hmg_identity_system_guidelines_2012.pdf Government identity system (2012)]. HM Government. "The Queen is Head of State, and the United Kingdom is governed by Her Majesty’s Government in the name of the Queen.
The royal coat of arms is personal to the Queen and..."&lt;/ref&gt; currently [[Queen Elizabeth II]]. These arms are used by the Queen in her official capacity as monarch of the [[United Kingdom]]. Variants of the Royal Arms are used by other members of the [[British royal family]]; and by the [[British government]] in connection with the administration and government of the country. In [[Scotland]], there exists a separate version of the Royal Arms, a variant of which is used by the [[Scotland Office]]. The arms in [[banner of arms|banner form]] serve as basis for the monarch's official flag, known as the ''[[Royal Standard of the United Kingdom|Royal Standard]]''.

In the standard variant used outside of Scotland, the shield is quartered, depicting in the first and fourth quarters the three passant guardant lions of England; in the second, the rampant lion and double tressure [[fleur-de-lis#Other European monarchs and rulers|flory-counterflory]] of Scotland; and in the third, a [[Clàrsach|harp]] for Ireland.&lt;ref name="Boutell"&gt;{{cite book |last=Brooke-Little |first=J.P., FSA |authorlink=John Brooke-Little |title=Boutell's Heraldry |origyear=1950 |edition=Revised |year=1978 |publisher=Frederick Warne LTD |location=London |isbn=0-7232-2096-4 |pages=205–222}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[crest (heraldry)|crest]] is a [[Lion (heraldry)|statant guardant lion]] wearing the [[St Edward's Crown]], himself on another representation of that crown. The [[Dexter and sinister|dexter]] [[supporters|supporter]] is a likewise crowned English lion; the sinister, a Scottish [[unicorn]]. According to legend a free unicorn was considered a very dangerous beast; therefore the heraldic unicorn is chained,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldicsculptor.com/royal%20unicorn.htm|title=Heraldic Sculptor- Accessed 29 April 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as were both supporting unicorns in the [[royal coat of arms of Scotland]].

In the greenery below, a [[thistle]], [[Tudor rose]] and [[shamrock]] are depicted, representing Scotland, England and Ireland respectively. This [[armorial achievement]] comprises the [[motto]], in [[French language|French]], of [[English monarchs]], ''[[Dieu et mon Droit]]'' (God and my Right), which has descended to the present [[royal family]] as well as the [[Order of the Garter#Heraldry|Garter circlet]] which surrounds the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|shield]], inscribed with the [[Order of the Garter|Order]]'s motto, ''[[Honi soit qui mal y pense]]'' (Shame on him who thinks evil).
The official [[blazon]] of the Royal Arms is:

{{quote|''Quarterly, first and fourth Gules three Lions passant gardant in pale Or armed and langued Azure (for England), second quarter Or a Lion rampant within a double tressure flory-counter-flory Gules (for Scotland), third quarter Azure a Harp Or stringed Argent (for Ireland), the whole surrounded by the Garter; for a Crest, upon the Royal helm the Imperial Crown Proper, thereon a Lion statant gardant Or imperially crowned Proper; Mantling Or and Ermine; for Supporters, dexter a Lion rampant gardant Or crowned as the Crest, sinister a Unicorn Argent armed, crined and unguled Proper, gorged with a Coronet Or composed of Crosses patées and Fleurs-de-lis a Chain affixed thereto passing between the forelegs and reflexed over the back also Or. Motto "Dieu et mon Droit" in the compartment below the shield, with the Union Rose, Shamrock and Thistle engrafted on the same stem.''&lt;ref name="Boutell"/&gt;}}

==Uses==
[[File:St Andrew's church - royal arms - geograph.org.uk - 1708484.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The Royal Arms as used by the [[House of Stuart]] (these being of William III and Mary II (1688-1694/1702))]]

The Royal Arms as shown above may only be used by the Queen herself. They also appear in courtrooms, since the monarch is deemed to be the fount of judicial authority in the United Kingdom and law courts comprise part of the ancient royal court (thus so named).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Traditions of the courts|url=https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/about-the-judiciary/the-justice-system/court-traditions/|website=Courts and Tribunals Judiciary|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judges are officially Crown representatives, demonstrated by the display of the Royal Arms behind the judge's bench in all UK courts (with the exceptions of the [[Magistrates' Court (England and Wales)|magistrates' court]] in the [[City of London]], where behind the [[Justices of the Peace]] stands a sword upright flanked by the arms of the City and the Crown). In [[Northern Ireland]], the Royal Arms cannot be displayed in courtrooms or on court-house exteriors. There are a few exceptions, with the Royal Arms allowed to be displayed in the courtrooms of the [[Royal Courts of Justice, Belfast|Royal Courts of Justice in Belfast]] and the courts in Armagh, Banbridge, Downpatrick, Magherafelt, or Omagh. They may be shown on the exterior of court buildings that had them in place prior to the 2002 law.&lt;ref&gt;Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2002 (c.26) 66 [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2002/26/body/enacted Display of Royal Arms at courts]&lt;/ref&gt;

As the United Kingdom is governed in the monarch's name, the British Government also uses the Royal Arms as a national symbol of the United Kingdom,&lt;ref&gt;Government identity system HM Government&lt;/ref&gt; and, in that capacity, the coat of arms can be seen on several government documents and forms, passports, in the entrance to embassies and consulates, etc. However, when used by the government and not by the monarch personally, the coat of arms is often represented without the helm. This is also the case with the sovereign's Scottish arms, a version of which is used by the [[Scotland Office]].

The Royal Arms have regularly appeared on the coinage produced by the [[Royal Mint]] including, for example, from 1663, the [[Guinea (British coin)|Guinea]] and, from 1983, the [[British one pound coin]].  In 2008, a new series of designs for all seven coins of £1 and below was unveiled by the Royal Mint, every one of which is drawn from the Royal Arms.  The full Royal Arms appear on the one pound coin, and sections appear on each of the other six, such that they can be put together like a puzzle to make another complete representation of the Royal Arms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalmint.com/newdesigns/designsRevealed.aspx The New Designs Revealed&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080404064611/http://www.royalmint.com/newdesigns/designsRevealed.aspx|date=4 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The monarch grant [[Royal Warrant of Appointment (United Kingdom)|Royal Warrant]]s to select businesses and tradespeople which supply the Royal Household with goods or services. This entitles those business to display the Royal Arms on their packaging and stationery by way of advertising.

It is customary (but not mandatory) for churches throughout the United Kingdom whether in the [[Church of England]] or the [[Church of Scotland]] to display the Royal Arms to show loyalty to the Crown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Treasures of Britain and Treasures of Ireland|edition=1976|publisher=Drive Publications|page=677}} Retrieved 15 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intriguing-history.com/royal-arms-in-church/|title=Royal Arms in church|publisher=Intriguing History|accessdate=31 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A banner of the Royal Arms, known as the [[Royal Standard (United Kingdom)|Royal Standard]], is flown from the royal palaces when the monarch is in residence, [[Windsor Castle]] and [[Buckingham Palace]] being her principal abodes; and from public buildings only when the monarch is present. This protocol equally applies to the monarch's principal residences in Scotland (the [[Palace of Holyroodhouse]] and [[Balmoral Castle]]), where the Royal Standard (Scottish version) is flown. When the monarch is not in residence the [[Union Flag]], or in Scotland the ancient [[Royal Standard of Scotland]], is flown.

The widely sold British newspaper ''[[The Times]]'' uses the Hanoverian Royal Arms as a logo, whereas its sister publication, ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', displays the current Royal Arms.

The Royal Arms are also displayed in all courts in [[British Columbia]], as well as in other Canadian provinces such as [[Ontario]], where the judges are appointed by Crown authority.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courts.gov.bc.ca/index.asp Welcome&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]{{dead link|date=December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Royal Arms were also displayed by all [[Governor-General of Australia|Viceroys of Australia]] as representation of their Crown authority.

The Royal Arms are also used and displayed in the Supreme Courts of South Australia and Victoria.

The Royal Arms were controversially used by former Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] as her official letterhead from {{circa|1997|lk=yes}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Summers |first2=Ben |last2=Streeter |first=Michael |title=The strange case of Lady Thatcher and Her Majesty's coat of arms |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/the-strange-case-of-lady-thatcher-and-her-majestys-coat-of-arms-1274739.html |newspaper=The Independent |date=24 March 1997 |accessdate=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|Royal coat of arms of Scotland}}
Since the [[Union of the Crowns]] in 1603, a separate version of the Royal Arms has been used in [[Scotland]], giving the Scottish elements pride of place.

The [[shield]] is quartered, depicting in the first and fourth quarters the lion ''rampant'' of Scotland; in the second, the three lions ''passant guardant'' of England; and in the third, the harp of [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]].

The [[crest (heraldry)|crest]] atop the [[Crown of Scotland]] is a red lion, seated and forward facing, itself wearing the Crown of Scotland and holding the two remaining elements of the [[Honours of Scotland]], namely the Sword of State and the Sceptre of Scotland. This was also the crest used in the Royal Arms of the [[Kingdom of Scotland]]. The motto, in [[Scots language|Scots]], appears above the crest, in the tradition of [[Scottish heraldry]], and is an abbreviated form of the full motto: ''[[In My Defens God Me Defend]]''.

The supporters change sides and both appear wearing the crowns of their respective Kingdom. The [[Dexter and sinister|dexter]] [[supporter]] is a crowned and chained unicorn, symbolising Scotland. The [[Dexter and sinister|sinister]] supporter is a crowned lion, symbolising England. Between each supporter and the shield is a lance displaying the flag of their respective Kingdom.

The coat also features both the motto ''[[Nemo me impune lacessit]]'' (No one wounds (touches) me with impunity) and, surrounding the shield, the [[Livery collar|collar]] of the [[Order of the Thistle]]. On the [[Compartment (heraldry)|compartment]] are a number of thistles, Scotland's national flower.

===England, Wales and Northern Ireland===
[[File:St Mary, Stone, Kent - Royal Arms - geograph.org.uk - 1490059.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The current version of the Royal Arms, displayed in the parish church of [[Stone, Kent]].]]
Unlike the [[Acts of Union 1707]] with Scotland, the [[Acts of Union 1800]] with Ireland did not provide for a separate Irish version of the royal arms.{{dubious|1706/7 says "the quartering the Arms, and the Rank and Precedency of the Lyon King of Arms of the Kingdom of Scotland as may best suit the Union, be left to her Majesty" and 1800 says nothing for or against. If the contention is that the 1800 acts have been interpreted as FORBIDDING separate royal arms for Ireland, then that requires specific cites.|date=November 2017}} The [[Arms of Ireland#Achievement|crest of the Kingdom of Ireland]] (''on a wreath Or and Azure, a tower triple-towered of the First, from the portal a hart springing Argent attired and unguled Or'') has had little or no official use since the union. When the [[Irish Free State]] established [[great Seal of the Irish Free State|its own seals]] in the 1930s, the "Fob Seal" used on [[letter of credence|letters of credence]] varied the British arms by having the harp in two quarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://difp.ie/viewdoc.asp?DocID=2243 |title=Memorandum on external seals |first=Joseph |last=Walshe |authorlink=Joseph Walshe |date=26 October 1937 |work=Documents on Irish Foreign Policy, Vol. V No. 97 |publisher=[[Royal Irish Academy]] |accessdate=20 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The harp quarter of the Royal Arms represents Ireland on both the English and Scottish versions.  Likewise, one English quarter is retained in the Scottish version, and one Scottish quarter is retained in the English version.  Thus, England, Scotland and Ireland are represented in all versions of the Royal Arms since they came under one monarch.
By contrast, there is no representation at all for [[Wales]] in the Royal Arms, as at the Act of Union 1707 Wales was an integral part of the Kingdom of England pursuant to the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542]]; thus, it has been argued Wales is represented in the English coat of arms.  However the argument is somewhat disengenuous as in 1535 the Welsh Dragon was already part of the Tudor Coat of Arms. Upon the accession of the Tudor monarchs, who were themselves of Welsh descent, a Welsh Dragon was used as a supporter on the Royal Arms. This was dropped by their successors, the Scottish House of Stuart, who replaced the Tudors' dragon supporter with the Scottish unicorn
In the 20th century, the [[coat of arms of Wales|arms of the principality of Wales]] were added as an inescutcheon to the [[Coat of arms of the Prince of Wales|coat of arms]] of the [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince of Wales]], and a banner of those arms with a green inescutcheon bearing the prince's crown is flown as his personal standard in Wales.  The so-called [[Prince of Wales's feathers]] are a heraldic badge rather than a coat of arms upon a shield, but they are not Welsh in any case.  They derive, in fact, from the English Princes of Wales (who may owe them to an exploit of [[Edward, the Black Prince]] at the [[Battle of Crécy]]) and carry the motto ''{{lang|de|Ich dien}}'' ([[German language|German]], "I Serve").  In any event, they do not form part of the Royal Arms, as opposed to the heraldic achievement of the Prince of Wales, who drops them upon his accession as King.

==History==

===Kingdoms of England and Scotland===
The current royal arms are a combination of the arms of the former kingdoms that make up the [[United Kingdom]], and can be traced back to the first arms of the kings of England and kings of Scots. Various alterations occurred over the years as the arms of other realms acquired or claimed by the kings were added to the royal arms. The table below tracks the changes in the royal arms from the original arms of King Richard I of England, and William I, King of Scots.

==Other variants==

===Royal family===
Members of the [[British royal family]] are granted their own personal arms which are based on the Royal Arms. Only children and grandchildren in the male line of the monarch are entitled to arms in this fashion: the arms of children of the monarch are differenced with a three-point [[Label (heraldry)|label]]; grandchildren of the monarch are differenced with a five-point label. An exception is made for the eldest son of the Prince of Wales, who bears a three-point label. Since 1911, the arms of the Prince of Wales also displays an [[inescutcheon]] of the ancient [[Coat of Arms of the Principality of Wales|arms of the Principality of Wales]]. 
Queens consort and the wives of sons of the monarch also have their own personal coat of arms. Typically this will be the arms of their husband impaled with their own personal arms or those of their father, if armigerous. However, the consorts of a Queen regnant are not entitled to use the Royal Arms. Thus [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]] has been granted his own personal arms.

Currently the following members of the royal family have their own arms based on the Royal Arms:

[[File:Coat of Arms of the British Government.jpg|thumb|150px|A version used by the [[British Government]] on official websites and departmental insignia.]]

Various versions of the Royal Arms are used by [[Her Majesty's Government]] in the United Kingdom, the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] and courts in some parts of the Commonwealth.

HM Government generally uses a simplified version of the Royal Arms with a crown replacing the helm and crest, and with no compartment.&lt;ref&gt;GOV.UK, Departments, agencies and public bodies [https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations]. Retrieved 10 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In relation to Scotland, the [[Scotland Office]] and the [[Advocate General for Scotland]] use the Scottish version, again without the [[Helmet|helm]] or [[crest (heraldry)|crest]], and the same was used as the day-to-day logo of the [[Scottish Executive]] until September 2007, when a [[rebranding]] exercise introduced the name ''[[Scottish Government]]'', together with a revised logo incorporating the [[flag of Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20170305194010/http://news.gov.scot/news/new-lord-lyon-king-of-arms-appointed |www.gov.scot New Lyon King-of-arms appointed]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Scottish Government continues to use the Arms on some official documents.

The simplified Royal Arms also feature:

* on all [[Act of Parliament|Acts of Parliament]];
* on the cover of all [[British passport|UK passports]];
* as an inescutcheon on the [[diplomatic flag]]s of British Ambassadors; and
* on all acts of the [[Anguilla House of Assembly]], the [[Sovereign Base Areas]], [[Pitcairn Islands]] and [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]] administrations.

Various courts in the Commonwealth also continue to use the Royal Arms:

* The [[Court of Appeal of British Columbia|Court of Appeal]], [[Supreme Court of British Columbia|Supreme Court]] and [[Provincial Court of British Columbia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courts.gov.bc.ca/court_of_appeal/hearing_list/|title=Court of Appeal - Hearing List|website=www.courts.gov.bc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.provincialcourt.bc.ca/|title=Provincial Court of British Columbia|website=www.provincialcourt.bc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore:
* A version of the crest of the Royal Arms, as used in Scotland, is used by the [[Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service]], the [[General Register Office for Scotland]] and the [[Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland]].
* The crowned shield of the Royal Arms encircled by the Garter is used by the [[Home Office]] and by the [[Parliament of Victoria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/|title=Parliament of Victoria - Home|website=www.parliament.vic.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The crowned shield of the Royal Arms is used by the [[Royal Mint]].
* The Royal Arms with the crest but without the helm is used as the rank insignia for Class 1 Warrant Officers in Her Majesty's Armed Forces.

}}
According to the post-1900 publications of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]],&lt;ref&gt;i.e. the writings of [[C. W. Leadbeater]], [[Annie Besant]], etc., as well as those authors influenced by the theosophical teachings such as [[Alice A. Bailey]], and [[Benjamin Creme]], and the [[Ascended Master Teachings]] of [[Guy Ballard]], [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]],  [[Geraldine Innocente]], [[Joshua David Stone]], and other Ascended Master Teachings / teachers,&lt;/ref&gt; '''Lord Sunat Kumara'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://ascension-research.org/sanat.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.luisprada.com/Protected/a_progress_report_on_our_ascension.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; is an "Advanced Being" at the [[Initiation (Theosophy)|Ninth level of initiation]] who is regarded as the 'Lord' or 'Regent' of [[Earth]] and of the [[Human race|humanity]], and is thought to be the head of the [[Spiritual Hierarchy]] of Earth who dwells in [[Shamballah]] (also known as 'The City of Enoch').

Shamballah is said by the adherents to the Ascended Master Teachings, to be a floating city manifested on the [[etheric plane]] somewhere above the [[Gobi Desert]] in the borderlands of [[Mongolia]].&lt;ref&gt;(See: '[[Autobiography of a Yogi]]' By [[Yogananda Paramahansa]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[A Tibetan Journey]] By Alexandra David-Neale. 1923.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Great White Brotherhood]] is a spiritual 'fraternity' of Ascended Beings, including Lord Sunat Kumara, long since dedicated to the eventual Salvation of Mankind and the establishment of Divine Law again in this Three-dimensional reality.

According to Elizabeth Van Buren, the Brotherhood once maintained (earthly) headquarters hidden in a remote valley near a sacred lake in old Tibet, until relatively recently, when, possibly due to the surmised threat of Communist China, they withdrew, allegedly through subterranean tunnels to an alternative earthly location in [[Peru]], where they are still reported as having an earth base (circa 1985).&lt;ref&gt;[[Authors Notes: 'The Refuge of the Apocalypse.]] By Elizabeth Van Buren. 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

These authors believe that Lord Sunat Kumara is the founder of the Great White Brotherhood, composed of [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]] (called in the Ascended Master Teachings [[Ascended Master]]s) and volunteers from other worlds who have joined together to advance spiritual evolution on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Schroeder, Werner ''Ascended Masters and Their Retreats'' Ascended Master Teaching Foundation 2004. Describes the founding of Shamballah by Sunat Kumara&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sanat Kumara in Hinduism==
Sanat Kumara appears as a [[rishi]] in the [[Hindu]] [[religious text]] the [[Chandogya Upanishad]]. A shrine to Sanat Kumara which attracts and unites people of all religions and faiths is situated in the town of [[Kataragama]], [[Sri Lanka]]. In Sanskrit, "Sanat Kumara" is "Eternal Youth" (from [[Sant (religion)|Sanat]] "eternal", Ku "with difficulty" and Mara "mortal"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.danijel.org/index.php?id=clanak&amp;articleID=161&amp;pageID=22 O znalcima vraga] — Danijel Turina&lt;/ref&gt;).

The Kumar resides in the most sublime center of our planet, [[Shamballa]], the [[sahasrara]] of the world.  The Kumara has several names, relating to the sahasrara centers of different Systemic Existences: At the Supra-Cosmic plane, he is called ''Sanatana''; at the Cosmic plane, it is ''Subrahmanya''; at the Solar plane, the Kumara is ''Sanaka''; at the Planetary plane, it is ''Sanandana''; and on this planet, it is ''Sanath'' Kumara. So Sanath Kumara is an aspect of Kumara that resides in Shamballa.

Scriptures, especially the [[Mahabharata]], say that it is Sanath Kumara who comes down to help the Divine Plan of Creation, when [[Lord Krishna]] came to be. He was born to Lord Krishna as his son, and he was named [[Pradyumna]]. Sanath Kumara incarnates himself through the Divine Mother [[Rukmini]] as Pradyumna. On completion of his work, He again gets back to his original position and takes to the seat in Shambala as Sanath Kumara. These details are given in the last chapters of [[Mahabharata]].

==Shamballa in Buddhism – home of the King of the World==

''Shambhala'' ([[Wylie transliteration|Tib]]. ''bde 'byung'') in [[Vajrayana Buddhism]] (the religion of [[Tibet]]) is a [[Sanskrit]] term meaning "place of peace/tranquility/happiness". [[Gautama Buddha]] is said by Vajrayana Buddhists to have taught the [[Kalachakra]] [[tantra]] on request of King [[Suchandra]] of Shambhala; the teachings are also said to be preserved in Shamballa.  The [[Stanzas of Dzyan]] from which [[Madame Blavatsky]] claimed to have gotten the information in [[The Secret Doctrine]] are believed by some scholars to have been a mistranslation of words ''Kalachakra tantra'' (''rGyud-sde'' in [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]]).&lt;ref&gt;Reigle, David and Nancy ''Blavatsky's Secret Books'' San Diego 1999. {{ISBN|0-913510-76-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shambhala is ruled over by a line of [[Kings of Shambhala]] known as [[Kulika]] or [[Kalki]] Kings (Tib. ''Rigden''), a monarch who upholds the integrity of the ''Kalachakra tantra''. In the teachings of Vajrayana Buddhism, the King of Shamballa is often metaphorically referred to as ''The King of the World''.  Shamballa was thought by the [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]]s to be somewhere north of [[Lake Manasarovar]] and its adjacent [[Mount Kailash|Mount Kailasa]], a [[sacred mountain]] in Tibet where it is thought that all the [[Ley line|dragon current]]s intersect.

==The Defender Lord at Kurama Temple==
The ancient Buddhist temple, [[Kurama-dera]] in [[Japan]], is host to a unique bodhisattva, the "Defender Lord", who is said to come from the planet Venus 6.5 million years ago. He is described as having the appearance of a 16-year-old boy.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==Sanat Kumara in Theosophy==
{{Theosophy}}
Sanat Kumara  was mentioned briefly  by the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophist]] [[Helena Blavatsky]].&lt;ref&gt;Blavatsky, Helena Petrovna ''The Secret Doctrine: The Synthesis of Science, Religion, and Philosophy'' – Theosophical Publishing House, 1888. Sanat Kumara – Volume I: 89, 457–458; Volume II: pages 106, 140, 319, 584.&lt;/ref&gt; She claimed he belonged to a group of beings, the "Lords of the Flame", whom Christian tradition has presented as [[Lucifer]] and the fallen angels.&lt;ref&gt;Blavatsky, Helena Petrovna ''The Secret Doctrine: The Synthesis of Science, Religion, and Philosophy'' – Theosophical Publishing House, 1888. Volume II pp 243 ff&lt;/ref&gt;

Sanat Kumara gained greater prominence when Blavatsky's close-friend and colleague  [[Charles W. Leadbeater]] wrote that Sanat Kumara was the "King" or ''Lord of the World'', and the head of the [[Great White Brotherhood]] of [[Mahatma]]s who had revealed the principles of theosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House, 1925 (Reprint: Kessinger Publishing, 1997) Pages 296–299&lt;/ref&gt;

Later authors who draw from Theosophical teachings such as [[Alice Bailey]] and [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]] have added to the story with further details. He is usually depicted as having the appearance of a 16-year-old boy, said to be the incarnation of the Will of the Logos, and purportedly possesses an unaging body not born of mortal woman.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=q6xVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA207&amp;lpg=PA207&amp;dq=sanat+kumara+theosophy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ts3XnQyt-F&amp;sig=IEXRZ-Z1gLLBh6-bQnczyiul1BM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiP-I-i6bvKAhXGlh4KHbeKBhk4FBDoAQgbMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=sanat%20kumara%20theosophy&amp;f=false First Principles of Theosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Descent of Sanat Kumara and the Lords of the Living Flame from Venus==
C.W. Leadbeater and later adherents of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] such as Alice A. Bailey believe that Sanat Kumara descended from the [[etheric plane]] of the planet [[Venus]] to [[Earth]] 18,500,000 years ago (A.E. Powell gives a figure of 16,500,000 years ago; [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]] of [[Church Universal and Triumphant]] does not give a specific date but says it was a minimum of 2,500,000 years ago). In [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], the beings that helped Sanat Kumara organize the expedition from [[Venus]] are called the "Lords of the Flame".  C.W. Leadbeater and [[Annie Besant]] said that Sanat Kumara brought 30 "Lords of the Flame" with him from Venus to help him set up his colony.&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House, 1925 (Reprint: Kessinger Publishing, 1997) Page 299&lt;/ref&gt; In the later version of the story promulgated by [[Guy Ballard]], notable "Lords of the Flame" include [[Gautama Buddha]], and the [[World Teacher]] (the being referred to alternately as [[Maitreya (Theosophy)|Maitreya]] or [[Christ]] by [[Benjamin Creme]]). [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]]'s [[Church Universal and Triumphant]] teaches that Sanat Kumara and the Lords of the Flame also brought [[144,000]] souls with them from Venus. Alice Bailey, on the other hand, gives the number 105 only. The prior incarnation and only incarnation of Maitreya, the Lord of Consciousness, according to some interpretations (not C.W. Leadbeater's), is Gauthama Siddartha Sakyamuni / Lord Buddha; according to these interpretations, he essentially 'overshadowed' the body of Gautama Siddhartha Buddha with Siddhartha's permission.

Sanat Kumara is regarded as the great guru, saviour of Earth. Believers in him see him in all the major religions, as [[Murugan|Skanda]]/[[Kartikkeya]] in [[Hinduism]], [[Brahma]]-'''Sanam Kumar''' in [[Buddhism]], the [[Ancient of Days]] in [[Judeo-Christian]] traditions, and identify him as [[Ahura Mazda]] in [[Zoroastrianism]] (although the last of these claims is contested from a lack of information on the subject). It is also considered that Sanat Kumara is [[Al Khdir]] (green man) known to [[Sufi]] Muslims (according to [[Dakshinamurti]]).

It is maintained in most of these versions of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] that [[Venus]], the 'Planet of Love', is the most spiritually advanced [[planet]] of our [[solar system]]. The beings living on the [[etheric plane]] of [[Venus]] are said to be hundreds of millions of years ahead of us in their spiritual evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Powell, A.E. ''The Solar System'' London: 1930 The Theosophical Publishing House (A Complete Outline of the Theosophical Scheme of Evolution) See chart on Page 33&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiritofra.com/EC_etheric_planes.htm Planetary Schemes of Our Solar System According to Theosophy:]&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that the governing council of [[Venus]] – the ''Seven Holy Kumars'' – sent one of themselves, Sanat Kumara, here to guide us.&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth &amp; Mark Clare Prophet (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana: 2003 Summit University Press, pages 339–341&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Theosophy, once Sanat Kumara arrived here, he directed the construction of the city of Shamballa on the [[etheric plane]] above the [[Gobi Desert]] to serve as his headquarters. Elizabeth Clare Prophet teaches that Shamballa was built physically on the White Island in the Gobi Sea (now the Gobi Desert), and was only later withdrawn from the physical to the etheric plane.

==City plan of Shamballa==
The main temple of Shamballa is topped with a [[Gold (color)|golden]] dome and is surrounded by seven smaller temples—one for each of the seven rays.  These temples are located on a number of wide [[boulevard]]s resembling the [[Champs-Elysees]].&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth &amp; Mark Clare Prophet, (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press Pages 465–470 Shamballa&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Elizabeth Clare Prophet, [[George Washington]] was divinely inspired by the Ascended Masters to choose [[city planner]] [[Pierre L'Enfant]] to create the [[city plan]] of [[Washington DC]] which, it is claimed, he unconsciously modeled on the plan of the city of Shamballa.

==Appellations (titles) of Sanat Kumara==
The most common title attributed to Lord Sanat Kumara in the Theosophical religious tradition is "Lord of the World". [[C.W. Leadbeater]] also states that an important duty of Sanat Kumara is to participate in an elaborate ritual every [[Wesak]] (the Full Moon of May) led by [[Gautama Buddha]], and also participated in by the [[Maitreya (Theosophy)|Maitreya]] (the being Theosophists identify as [[Christ]]), in which [[Spiritual energy|cosmic energy]] is focused from the "Solar Logos" to Earth in order to keep our planet's cosmic energy in balance.  The ritual is said to take place in a ravine in southern [[Tibet]] (the Frontispiece of Leadbeater's book ''The Masters and the Path'' has a picture of the ritual taking place) and, it is stated by Leadbeater, can be viewed by in the [[etheric body]] or in the [[physical body]] by those who have [[third eye|etheric sight]].&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House 1929 (Reprint: Kessinger Publishing 1997) – Fold-out picture facing the title page of the book shows a picture of Lord Sananda Buddha performing the Wesak ritual&lt;/ref&gt;

Paradoxically, two other common appellations of Sanat Kumara are two opposite titles: "The Ancient of Days" (because he has been on [[Earth]] millions of years) and "The Youth of Sixteen Summers" (because even though he is millions of years old, he still looks like he is 16 years old).  Another of his titles is "The One Initiator" because it is said by C. W. Leadbeater in the ''Masters and the Path'' that he personally performs the initiation ceremony for anyone who has reached the third level of spiritual [[Initiation (Theosophy)|initiation]].  [[Alice A. Bailey]] indicates the same in her writings.

In the all organizations subscribing to the "''Ascended Master Teachings''", Sanat Kumara is presented  as an [[Ascended master|Ascended Master]]. He is also currently, according to the Ascended Master Teachings, known as the "Regent Lord of the World" in deference to [[Gautama Buddha]] having taken the office of "Lord of the World". (1956).&lt;ref&gt;Luk, A.D.K.. ''Law of Life – Book II''. Pueblo, Colorado: A.D.K. Luk Publications 1989. Describes Sanat Kumara and his role in founding the Brotherhood on Earth and passing the office of "Lord of the World" to Lord Sananda.&lt;/ref&gt; With Sananda Buddha taking on more of the day-to-day administrative tasks of governing the planet, this arrangement allows Sanat Kumara more time for the long-range [[Milky Way Galaxy|galactic]] planning and interstellar diplomacy that is necessary for him to prepare Earth for its eventual admission to what [[Joshua David Stone]] calls the [[Spiritual Hierarchy#Galactic Confederation of Planets|Galactic Confederation of Planets]].

Sanat Kumara's symbol of the authority of his office as ''Lord of the World'' is a {{convert|2|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}}, {{convert|2|in|mm|adj=mid|-wide}} [[magic wand]] called the ''Rod of Power'' made of the metal [[orichalcum]], with cone-shaped [[diamond]]s on each end.&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House 1925 Pages 268–269&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lady Master Venus==
[[The Bridge to Freedom]], [[Church Universal and Triumphant]] and all other "[[Ascended Master Teachings]]" organizations believe that Sanat Kumara has a ''Divine Complement'' (''Twin Flame'') (i.e., a ''celestial wife'') – '''Lady Master Venus'''[http://www.missionstgermain.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/ladymastervenus.jpg]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.missionstgermain.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderpictures/ladymastervenus.jpg Image of Lady Master Venus shown above is originally from the Church Universal and Triumphant):]&lt;/ref&gt; – the New Age "[[goddess|Goddess of Love]]".&lt;ref&gt;Booth, Annice ''The Masters and Their Retreats '' Summit Lighthouse Library June 2003, Summarizes the beliefs about Sanat Kumara by The I AM Activity, The Bridge to Freedom, and The Summit Lighthouse&lt;/ref&gt; The Ascended ''Lady Master Venus'' is usually depicted as having the appearance of a 16-year-old girl.  Sanat Kumara is believed to have [[Marriage|married]] Lady Master Venus millions of years ago on Venus before he came to Earth.

==Lady Master Meta==

According to the Ascended Master Teachings, Sanat Kumara and the Lady Master Venus have a daughter named the '''Lady Master Meta''' [http://www.ethericretreats.com/images/meta.jpg] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethericretreats.com/meta.htm Source of (not very clear) Image of the Lady Master Meta—Etheric Retreats website:]&lt;/ref&gt; who they brought with them from Venus.  She is said to have incarnated as an [[Avatar]] in Atlantis (where she served as the [[high priestess]] at the ''Temple of Healing'') and in [[Sassanian Empire|Sassanian Persia]], where she married a [[wikt:mortality|mortal]] and had three children.  In the Ascended Master Teachings, she is revered as the ''Goddess of Healing'' and is the patron deity of [[physician|doctor]]s and [[nurse]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press, pages 227–228 Lady Master Meta&lt;/ref&gt; Since she is [[Immortality|immortal]], possessing a celestial body like Sanat Kumara and the Lady Master Venus, she, like the Lady Master Venus, also has the appearance of a 16-year-old girl.

==Master Cha Ara==

According to the Ascended Master Teachings, the '''Master Cha Ara''' [http://www.worldglobalexpress.com/BofLight/CHA-ARA.JPG ] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldglobalexpress.com/brotherhoodoflight.htm Source of Image of Master Cha Ara – World Global Express Brotherhood of Light:]&lt;/ref&gt;
was originally one of the three children of Lady Master Meta when she incarnated as an Avatar in [[Sassanian empire|Sassanian Persia]].  He became a master [[alchemy|alchemist]] who formulated an [[elixir of immortality]] made from [[Rose|rose petals]], tea leaves from mcleod ganj and other ingredients.  This enabled him to quickly achieve ascended masterhood.  He uses small amounts of the elixir to heal people.  He is the protector of all [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrians]].  He works with [[St. Germain (Theosophy)|St. Germain]] to bring about the New Age in the West [[Americas]].  Lady Master Meta’s husband and her other two children from her descent as an Avatar to Sassanian Persia have also become ascended masters but their names have not yet been revealed.&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press Page 52 Master Cha Ara; pages 227–228 Lady Master Meta&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lady Master Nada==

In the [[Ascended Master Teachings]], a group of religions based on [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], '''Lady Master Nada'''&lt;ref&gt;Artist concept:[http://www.summitlh.com/minneapolis/chohans/chohans_files/_notes/nada-lrg-n.jpg] - source of image Summit Lighthouse Teaching Center (Minneapolis-St. Paul, USA)&lt;/ref&gt; is the "Chohan of the Sixth Ray" (see [[Seven Rays]]), and is the [[Ascended master|Ascended Lady Master]] governing humanity's development of the Divine Qualities of Ministration, Service, and Peace. The colors of her [[Seven Rays|Ray]] are [[purple]] and [[Gold (color)|gold]], and also [[Ruby (color)|ruby]].&lt;ref name="Life Book II"&gt;Luk, A.D.K.. ''Law of Life – Book II''. Pueblo, Colorado: A.D.K. Luk Publications 1989, Listing of Ascended Masters by The I AM Activity and [[The Bridge to Freedom]]&lt;/ref&gt;

She is also considered a Member of the [[Sanat Kumara#Sanat Kumara's cosmic bureaucracy|Karmic Board]]; she handles the appeals of those on the [[Seven Rays|third ray]].  She is believed by those adherent to the Ascended Master Teachings to have succeeded the previous Chohan, the '''Master Jesus / Sananda Buddha''', on January 1, 1956, when she is said to have fully taken on the Office of Chohan of the Sixth Ray.,&lt;ref&gt;Booth, Annice ''The Masters and Their Retreats '' Summit Lighthouse Library June 2003, Listing of Ascended Masters by The I AM Activity, The Bridge to Freedom, and [[The Summit Lighthouse]] Pages 144 and 240&lt;/ref&gt; thus advancing from the [[Initiation (Theosophy)|fifth to the sixth level of initiation]].  She primarily serves at ''Arabian  Retreat'' in the [[Arabian Peninsula]], northeast of the [[Red Sea]].&lt;ref name="Life Book II" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shearer, Monroe &amp; Carolyn ''I AM Adorations, Affirmations &amp; Rhythmic Decrees'' Acropolis Sophia Books and Works 1998, Listing of Ascended Masters by The I AM Activity, The Bridge to Freedom, The Summit Lighthouse, and The Temple of The Presence&lt;/ref&gt; Nada serves there with the Brothers and Sisters of the [[Indigo]] Cape, as well as with [[Master Jesus|Jesus]], his [[Mother Mary]] and El Samyam, the  Chief of the Arabian Council.&lt;ref&gt;King, Godfre Ray. ''The Magic Presence''. The Compt de Saint-Germain Press 1935. Chapter 10&lt;/ref&gt; She also serves at ''The [[Rose (color)|Rose]] Temple'', located on the [[etheric plane]] above [[New Bedford, Massachusetts]]. Designed after the pattern of a [[rose]], with each "petal" being a room, this Retreat is the etheric counterpart of the "Temple of Love" on [[Root race#The civilization of Atlantis|Atlantis]] where Nada once served as a High Priestess.  In another human incarnate life in Atlantis, she was a [[lawyer]].&lt;ref&gt;Schroeder, Werner ''Ascended Masters and Their Retreats'' Ascended Master Teaching Foundation 2004, Listing of those who are believed to be Ascended Masters by The [[I AM Activity]] and The Bridge to Freedom&lt;/ref&gt; She was described as having raised her body and [[Initiation (Theosophy)|Ascended]] approximately 2,776 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;King, Godfre Ray. ''The I AM Discourses''. Saint Germain Press 1935. page 74&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Lady Master Nada's home residence (called in the Ascended Master Teachings her "retreat") is underground on the etheric plane on the Arabian peninsula, according to the Ascended Master Teachings, she teleports to Shamballa every workday to her day job on the [[Sanat Kumara#Sanat Kumara's cosmic bureaucracy|Karmic Board]], hearing the cases of those souls who are on the third ray.

==Masters of the Ancient Wisdom==

According to  the [["I AM" Activity]], the [[Church Universal and Triumphant]]&lt;ref&gt;Shearer, Monroe &amp; Carolyn ''I AM Adorations, Affirmations &amp; Rhythmic Decrees'' Acropolis Sophia Books and Works 1998. Refers also to the other six Kumars that assist Sanat Kumara&lt;/ref&gt; and others, the [[Ascended Master]]s (The great beings the original Theosophists called the "[[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]]"), such as the [[Master Jesus]], [[Count of St Germain|Saint Germain]], '''Megha Alcorn''' aka '''Megan Sebastian''' on [[Earth]],   [[Kuthumi]], '''Hatton''', [[Gopal Das]] and others are working for the [[Spiritual Hierarchy]] of our planet, under the leadership of Lord Sanat Kumara, [[Gautama Buddha]], and [[Maitreya (Theosophy)|Maitreya]].  Many theosophists believe the "Masters" utilize the cosmic power of the [[Seven Rays]] to advance the ''Plan of the Masters'' to encourage the continual advance of [[civilization]] on [[Earth]] toward higher [[Initiation (Theosophy)|levels of consciousness]]. One of the beliefs of adherents of these belief systems is that the Masters of Wisdom have united together in an organization called the ''[[Great White Brotherhood]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Great White Brotherhood in the Culture, History and Religion of America''. Summit University Press 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sanat Kumara is also often referred to as the manifestation of the 'Solar Logos'==

The Theosophist '''A.E. Powell''' stated that Sanat Kumara (whom he refers to as the ''Lord of the World'') is in continuous telepathic rapport with '''ANNA''' / [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], the ''Spirit of the Earth'' (i.e., the ''Planetary Logos'' – equivalent to the goddess known in some religions as [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]] or as Prithivi in Hinduism).&lt;ref&gt;Powell, A.E. ''The Solar System'' London:1930 The Theosophical Publishing House (A Complete Outline of the Theosophical Scheme of Evolution)&lt;/ref&gt;[[C.W. Leadbeater]] and [[Alice A. Bailey]] stated that Sanat Kumara is in continuous [[Telepathy|telepathic]] rapport with the [[Spiritual Hierarchy#Cosmic beings functioning within the Sun|Solar Logos]] (the Being considered by Theosophists as the consciousness of the [[Sun]]). It is believed in Theosophy that Sanat Kumara captures the mystical power of the [[Seven Rays]] from the Solar Logos and distributes it to his assistants who guide the spiritual evolution of humanity, the ''Masters of the Ancient Wisdom'' (the Ascended Masters), who then focus the power to us.  An intermediate trinity of [[Pratyeka]]-Buddhas assists Lord Buddha in stepping down this power from Sanat Kumara to Earth's [[Spiritual Hierarchy]], and these Buddhas are also said to be Kumars originally from Venus.

==The council chamber of the Lord of the World==

According to the ''[[Alice Bailey#Bibliography|Alice A. Bailey material]]'', Lord Sanat Kumara conducts business in an enormous room in his palace called ''The Council Chamber of the Lord of the World''.  It is here that he regularly meets with [[Maitreya (Theosophy)|Maitreya]], the '''Maha Chohan''', [[Djwal Khul]], [[St. Germain (Theosophy)|St. Germain]], the [[Master Jesus]] and the other [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]], of which it is said there are 24 principal council members, to assess the progress being made in implementing ''The Plan of the Masters'' to bring the [[human race]] to [[Level of consciousness|higher levels of consciousness]].  According to C.W. Leadbeater, it is also here that he periodically personally receives ambassadors from [[Planetary system|other solar systems]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Leadbeater, C.W.  ''The Masters and the Path''  Adyar, Madras, India: 1925 – Theosophical Publishing House&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sanat Kumara's cosmic bureaucracy==

According to the ''[[Alice Bailey#Bibliography|Alice A. Bailey material]]'', Sanat Kumara has many assistants who help him in his arduous task of spiritually governing Earth as its presiding Regent. 
These include '''The Watcher''' (also called the ''Silent Watcher'' or the ''Great Silent Watcher''), whose function it is to continually watch the [[Akashic records]] and download daily all the [[information]] on them relevant to the life waves of Earth and forward it to the ''Custodian of the Hall of Records''.&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House, 1925 (Reprint: Kessinger Publishing, 1997) Page 300&lt;/ref&gt; (the Watcher is part of a special race of beings who fulfill this function that are posted on planets throughout the [[Cosmos]] &lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press (Note: the idea that Watcher was part of race of beings posted throughout the Cosmos to fulfill this functions was first promulgated by C.W. Leadbeater and continued by Guy Ballard and Elizabeth Clare Prophet) The Great Silent Watchers Page 122&lt;/ref&gt; ); the '''Lords of Karma''' – Alice A. Bailey mentioned three ''Lords of Karma'' but did not name them; they are called in the Ascended Master Teachings the '''Karmic Board''' and they are stated to number seven and each of them is identified by name: '''The Great Divine Director''' (1st ray), '''The Goddess of Liberty''' (2nd ray), '''[[Lady Master Nada]]''' (3rd ray), '''Cyclopea''' (4th ray), '''[[Athena|Pallas Athena]]''' (5th ray), '''Lady Master Portia''' (6th ray), and '''[[Kwan Yin]]''' (7th ray).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.empyreanquest.com/liberty.htm Identity of the seven members of the Karmic Board according to the Ascended Master Teachings—The Goddess of Liberty, Kwan Yin, Pallas Athena, The Great Divine Director, Cyclopea, Nada, and Portia:] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091118080316/http://www.empyreanquest.com/liberty.htm |date=18 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press, pages 153–155 The Karmic Board&lt;/ref&gt;  The Karmic Board decides when [[soul]]s that are between lives are to reincarnate again (if a disembodied soul desires to reincarnate somewhere or somewhen else than where they have been assigned, they must file an appeal with the Karmic Board—each person has to file an appeal to the member of the board that handles the appeals for their ''soul ray''); and the one Alice A. Bailey calls the '''Custodian of the Hall of Records''' (called the '''Keeper of the Scrolls''' in the Ascended Master Teachings), the being who is in charge of the ''Hall of Records'', an enormous administrative complex near Sanat Kumara’s palace in the etheric city of Shamballa—this is where the ''Recording Angels'' and those souls who are between incarnations who volunteer to give up their time in [[The Summerland#Summerland in Theosophy|Summerland]] and help perform this work make visual records (utilizing the most advanced [[supercomputers]] on the etheric plane of Earth) of everything that happens in everyone’s lives on Earth.  The raw [[data]] is first downloaded daily by ''The Watcher'' from the [[Akashic records]] and fed by him to the ''Custodian of the Hall of Records'' and thence forwarded to the ''recording angels'' and their volunteer helpers.  These [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] records are sorted daily first into one of seven general files by the ''soul ray'' (see [[seven rays]]) of the soul that is reincarnating, and then downloaded from that general file into a special individual file for each soul that can be consulted by the ''Karmic Board'' if that soul makes an appeal before it.

==Omri-Tas, Ruler of the Violet Planet==

'''Omri-Tas''', the ''Ruler of the Violet Planet'', is a [[Milky Way Galaxy|Galactic]] level Ascended Master ('''[[Spiritual Hierarchy]], Cosmic Beings''') who with his celestial mate, Irmo-Sat, [http://www.sintoniasaintgermain.com.br/elohim_of_aquariuslrg_.jpg],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sintoniasaintgermain.com.br/cosmicos_setimo.htm Source of Image of Omri-Tas, Ruler of the Violet Planet and his Twin Flame – "Sintonia / Saint Germain". Portuguese language Ascended Master Teachings website:]&lt;/ref&gt; is Sanat Kumara's [[Ascended Master Teachings#Violet Flame|violet flame]] supplier.  The violet flame is composed of a special type of [[Occult Chemistry (book)|etheric matter particles]], which may plausibly be called ''violetrons'',  that are capable of cleansing bad [[karma]].   ''Omri-Tas'' rules a planet on the [[etheric plane]] called the Violet Planet, which is apparently several dozen to several hundred [[light year]]s from Earth.  The Violet Planet is one of many throughout the Cosmos that serve as reservoirs for the violet flame.  Omri-Tas is the ruler of the Violet Planet that is closest to Earth and which is responsible for transmitting the violet flame from the [[Spiritual Hierarchy|'''Great Central Sun''']] of the Cosmos via the '''Galactic Logos''' to planets in [[Spiritual Hierarchy|Ursa Major (Our sector is reputedly 'Sector Nine' of the 48 Sectors in this spiral Galaxy)]].  Omri-Tas or one of his representatives periodically teleports from the Violet Planet to Shamballa with canisters of violet flame to replenish the violet flame in the large circular pool in the ''Temple of the Violet Flame'' in Shamballa (In return for the violet flame. Lord Sanat Kumara assigns to his care and tutelage worthy initiated Adepts/Chelas for etheric transport to their next assignments.&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press, pages 249–253 Omri-Tas, Ruler of the Violet Planet&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benjamin Creme's views==
[[Benjamin Creme]] subscribes to the modern esoteric view that [[Nordic aliens]] (like those mentioned by [[George Adamski]] – Creme accepts Adamski's sightings as valid.) pilot [[flying saucer]]s from the Way-Station on Venus that is thought to exist on the [[etheric plane]] (Esotericists believe that since the Venusians' civilization is on the ''etheric plane'', the planet's [[heat]] doesn't affect them) and are capable of stepping down the level of vibration of themselves and their craft to the slower level of vibration of the atoms of the [[physical plane]].&lt;ref&gt;Creme, Benjamin ''The Reappearance of the Christ and the Masters of the Wisdom'' London:1980 Tara Press Page 205&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Creme's followers assume that Sanat Kumara and the 'Lords of the Flame' [See Elizabeth Van Buren's Book of the same name.](Nordic aliens themselves) visit from Venus in a flying saucer. How, they ask, did Sanat Kumara get to Earth from Venus if it wasn't on a flying saucer?  Creme's disciples believe that there is regular flying saucer traffic between Venus and Shamballa as well as other locations on Earth, especially areas where [[crop circles]] appear.  Creme's acolytes believe that Shamballa is equipped with an [[Spaceport|astrodrome]] as well as with numerous flying saucer landing pads attached to the tops or the sides of the buildings to accommodate the heavy flying saucer traffic from Venus.  Since Shamballa is envisioned as a [[floating city (science fiction)|floating city]] about five miles above the surface of the earth on the etheric plane, there are also numerous entrances in the basements of the buildings, where flying saucers can enter from the bottom of the city and park in spacious flying saucer parking garages provided in the basement levels of the buildings. In addition, says Creme, the Venusians have cigar-shaped [[mother ship]]s up to four miles long to accommodate the transport of multiple individual flying saucers to and from Venus.&lt;ref&gt;Creme, Benjamin ''The Great Approach'' Amsterdam:2001 Share International Foundation Page 133&lt;/ref&gt; According to Creme, sometimes flying saucers from places more distant than Venus, such as from [[Mars]], the [[Moons of Jupiter]], [[Uranus]], [[Sirius]], the [[Pleiades]], and beyond, fly in to pay a visit at Shamballa.  Since, according to Creme, the Venusians flying saucer designers outsource the actual construction of their flying saucers to the [[Martians]] (who are said to dwell on the etheric plane of Mars),&lt;ref&gt;Creme, Benjamin ''Maitreya's Mission – Volume III'' Amsterdam:1997 Share International Foundation Page 337&lt;/ref&gt; whom he describes as the "master engineers of the [[solar system]]",&lt;ref&gt;Creme, Benjamin ''Maitreya's Mission – Volume III'' Amsterdam:1997 Share International Foundation Page 194&lt;/ref&gt; Shamballa provides a convenient neutral ground where the Venusians and the Martians can meet to evaluate new flying saucer designs and negotiate flying saucer construction contracts between themselves.

==Ashtar Galactic Command Flying Saucer Fleet==
The Master [[Ashtar (extraterrestrial being)|Ashtar]] was first incorporated into the Ascended Master Teachings by [[Joshua David Stone]] in the early 1990s, based on his incorporation of the early 1980s revelations of the medium [[Ashtar (extraterrestrial being)#Tuella|Tuella]] into his own teachings. Stone had already begun teaching in 1993, based on the early 1980s revelations of Tuella, that the [[Master Jesus]], under his [[Milky Way Galaxy|galactic]] name '''Sananda''' (the name, Stone stated, he adopted after his resurrection), works with '''[[Ashtar (extraterrestrial being)|Commander Ashtar]]''', flying with '''[[Pallas Athena]]''' in their own flying saucer within the [[Spiritual Hierarchy#Cosmic beings said to be patrolling near Earth|Ashtar Galactic Command flying saucer fleet]] as its ''Commander-in-Chief''.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Joshua David ''Cosmic Ascension: Your Cosmic Map Home'' (March 1998) (Book 6 of the multi-volume series, The Easy-To-Read Encyclopedia of the Spiritual Path) {{ISBN|0-929385-99-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Stone, another name used by ''Commander Ashtar'' to denote his flying saucer fleet is ''The Airborne Division of the Great White Brotherhood''. Although the Ashtar Command is ultimately under the titular authority of Sanat Kumara, the Master Jesus in consultation with Pallas Athena and Ashtar, make all the day to day command decisions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iamuniversity.org/iamu/mobile/literature/lodges/spiritual_extraterrestrials_lodge/3661-The-Ashtar-Command.html The Ashtar Command by Joshua David Stone:] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111227160744/http://www.iamuniversity.org/iamu/mobile/literature/lodges/spiritual_extraterrestrials_lodge/3661-The-Ashtar-Command.html |date=27 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stone continued to present these teachings after 1996 at the yearly Wesak Mount Shasta gatherings.

According to some, The Ashtar Command is simply a modern concept of the Sumerian/Babylonian goddess and deity [[Astarte]]/[[Ishtar]]/[[Isis]] and her entourage whose assigned function is to protect an evolving mankind from the [[Satan|Satanic forces]], then extant, on this planet, that sought to usurp the Earthly Regency of the local Ascended Masters in their role of protecting and engendering Divine Law upon the Earth until the arrival, at 'The Meridian of Time' of 'The [[Son of God]]'... Jesus/Sananda and his incarnation of 'The Christ Being'.&lt;ref&gt;''The Book of Al Daoud.'' [By 'The Pen'. 1930].&lt;/ref&gt;

Lourene Altiery, also known as ''Karita'' to her followers, is an Ascended Master Teachings teacher originally from [[Joliet, Illinois]] who now resides in [[Sun Lakes, Arizona]] – she set up her website in 2001.  According to Altiery, there are four Masters originally from the [[Spiritual Hierarchy]] Cosmic beings said to be patrolling near [[Earth|Ashtar Galactic Command Flying Saucer Fleet]] who are now permanently stationed on Shamballa.  These are the Masters '''Ballerian''', who is the proprietor of a flying saucer repair facility in Shamballa called ''God's Garage''; '''Kumad''', an expert [[linguist]] who helps the Keeper of the Scrolls decipher and interpret ancient manuscripts; '''Ashlem''',  a [[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] Master who resides at the Hall of Records and helps people decipher their past lives by assisting them in accessing the [[Akashic records]]; and '''Sutko''', the "space detective", who helps the Master K-17 solve unusually difficult cases.  Elements of the ''[[Ashtar (extraterrestrial being)|Ashtar]] Galactic Command Flying Saucer Fleet'' sometimes dock at Shamballa so the flying saucer crews can go on '[[shore leave]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Altiery, Lourene (Karita) ''The World's Greatest Teachings by Christ the Master and Other Avatars, Telepathically Communicated to Karita 2002'' {{ISBN|0-9718008-0-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.serversofall.com/ Servers of All web page (Lourene Altiery)—Images of the cosmic beings described above in the mid-level command hierarchy of the Ashtar Galactic Command flying saucer fleet are depicted on this web page:]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hatonn and the Photon Belt==

According to the Ascended Master Teachings of Anne Bellringer of [[Rapid City, South Dakota]], who began teaching in 1990, '''Hatonn''', an [[android (robot)|android]] [[Pleiadean]] Master who flies aboard the flying saucer ''Phoenix'' (one of the flying saucers of the ''Ashtar Galactic Command Flying Saucer Fleet'', piloted by Hatonn’s partner the Master '''Soltec'''), monitors events on Earth for the ''Galactic Hall of Records'' at the [[galactic Center|galactic core]].

He feeds information about events on Earth via [[Subspace radio|subspace relay]] to the [[supercomputer]]s at the "Galactic Hall of Records".  However, Bellringer says that this activity is secondary to Hatonn's primary task, which is functioning as the [[liaison officer]] between Sanat Kumara and the [[Pleiadeans]] in order for him to be able to help Earth safely navigate in [[2012 phenomenon|2012]] through the approaching so-called "[[photon belt]]", said to emanate from the [[Pleiades]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://hatonnspeaksthetruth.wordpress.com/2010/01/25/hatonn-introduction-to-the-photon-belt/ Hatonn and the Photon Belt:]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fourwinds10.com/siterun_static/general/about_fourwinds.php Four Winds10.com—website of Anne Bellringer:]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christian criticism==

According to many Christians, notably the anti-[[New Age]] author [[Constance Cumbey]], New Age Leaders, including Masters of the [[Illuminati]], are actually worshipping the Lord of this World, whose name is Sanat Kumara (Alice Bailey, ''Externalisation of the Hierarchy'', p.&amp;nbsp;676, 709, 725; and Elizabeth Van Buren, ''The Secret of the Illuminati'', p.&amp;nbsp;1). Bailey goes on to explain that Sanat Kumara is the "life and the forming intelligence", presiding over the Council of Shamballa [the Heaven of Earth according to New Age doctrine]. (''The New Age Dictionary'', p.&amp;nbsp;172) Further, Sanat Kumara is "the eternal youth from the Planet [[Venus]]". The name Lucifer is one of the ancient Greek names for Venus. Therefore, according to Cumbey, Sanat Kumara is merely another name for [[Satan]] or [[Lucifer]]. (Cumbey, ''Hidden Dangers of the Rainbow'') [7].

==Theosophical reply to Christian criticism==
Other [[New Age]] leaders have tried to separate themselves from the Illuminati movement, and view that burdening the two groups as entirely coexistent is inaccurate and ineffectual. New Age theosophy also counters these critics, teaching the fact that the being known as Sanat Kumara would rather see spiritual harmony and peace, a fact which many Illuminati members ignore and abuse.

In the glossary of in the back of the book ''Alchemy'', which [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]] claims was dictated to her by [[Kuthumi]], Satan and Sanat Kumara are clearly distinguished as two different and opposed beings—Satan working for evil and Sanat Kumara for good.&lt;ref&gt;"Kuthumi" (dictated to [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]]) ''Alchemy'' 1982 Summit Lighthouse See glossary at end of book&lt;/ref&gt;

==Skeptical view==
The scholar [[K. Paul Johnson]] maintains that the "Masters" that [[Madame Blavatsky]] wrote about and produced letters from were actually idealizations of people who were her [[mentor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Paul K. Initiates of Theosophical Masters Albany, New York:1995 State University of New York Press&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''Sanat Kumara'', although mentioned in passing by Madame Blavatsky, was never mentioned by her as an important "Master" that Blavatsky claimed to have met.  He was first presented, under the name ''Lord of the World'', as the head of the "Masters" by [[C.W. Leadbeater]] in his 1925 book ''The Masters and the Path''.&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path''. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House, 1925 (Reprint: Kessinger Publishing, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sanat Kumara in popular culture==

'''[[Panelology]]'''
*Sanat Kumara’s helper ''The Watcher'' was apparently made into a [[Marvel Comics]] character called [[Uatu]] by [[Stan Lee]] in 1963. The [[Watcher (comics)|Watcher comic books]] have tales about a special race of beings talented at [[information processing]] called ''The Watchers'' spread throughout the [[Cosmos]], and it is believed in Theosophy and the Ascended Master Teachings that The Watcher belongs to.{{citationeeded|date=January 2016}}
'''Video games'''
*Sanat Kumara is the name of Helena Blavatsky's Noble Phantasm in ''[[Fate/Grand Order]]''. It takes the form of a flying saucer.

The '''Seven Bishops''' of the [[Church of England]] were those imprisoned and tried for [[seditious libel]] related to their opposition to the second [[Declaration of Indulgence]], issued by [[James II of England|James II]] in 1688. In a major embarrassment to the Crown, they were found not guilty.

==Background==
The Declaration granted broad religious freedom in England by suspending penal laws that enforced conformity to the Church of England, by allowing persons to worship in their homes or chapels as they saw fit, and by ending affirming religious oaths as a requirement for employment in government office.

==Sequence of events==
The Declaration of Indulgence had originally been given out on 4 April 1687. The King republished it, with some new prefatory matter, on 25 April 1688. On 4 May the King and his council ordered the bishops that the declaration should be read in all the (Anglican) churches – those of London on 20 May and outside London on 27 May and the two following Sundays. This was the only way to make the document swiftly and generally known, which was James's straightforward object. The Anglican clergy felt it a challenge to themselves, for many of them were opposed to the toleration of Roman Catholics and Nonconformists, as were very many English people.

Nine days passed with no objection; then, on 13 May, at [[Lambeth Palace]], Compton (Bishop of London), Sancroft (Archbishop of Canterbury), Turner (Bishop of Ely) and White (Bishop of Peterborough), resolved to defy James's order.&lt;ref&gt;Milne-Tyte, Robert, ''Bloody Jeffreys: the hanging judge'', André Deutsch, London, 1989,  p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; They summoned seven others, of whom four actually came – Lake (Bishop of Chichester), Lloyd (St Asaph), Trelawny (Bristol) and Ken (Bath and Wells) – to a meeting of eight. Compton was under suspension following another dispute with the King. The others, known as the Seven Bishops, signed a petition requesting that they be excused; they claimed that the King did not have the legal right to make exemptions from statutes, the dispensing power having been declared illegal by Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter, Edward, ''The Protestant Bishop: Being the Life of Henry Compton, 1632–1713, Bishop of London'', [[Longmans, Green and Co.]], 1956, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the King's power to dispense individuals from the provisions of a statute – that is to declare that the individual need not observe its provisions – had recently been reaffirmed in ''Godden v Hales''&lt;ref&gt;''State Trials'' Vol. IX pp1196-9&lt;/ref&gt; after James had dismissed judges he knew to be opposed to his exercise of it.  The  Lord Chief Justice, Sir [[Edward Herbert (judge)|Edward Herbert]],  had  ruled   in ''Godden v Hales''  that : "It is an indispensable prerogative in the Kings of England to dispense with  penal laws in particular cases, and upon particular necessary reasons...Of those reasons and those necessities the King himself is the sole judge."&lt;ref&gt;''State Trials''&lt;/ref&gt;

On the night of Friday, 18 May, the Seven Bishops (apart from Sancroft) presented their petition to the King, who read it and was furious. He proclaimed it "a standard of rebellion" and dismissed them, saying that he expected to be obeyed and that "God hath given me this dispensing power and I will maintain it."&lt;ref name=C117&gt;Carpenter, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; The petition was soon printed and distributed for sale on the streets of London; Compton may have been responsible for that.&lt;ref name=C117/&gt; The seven were put on trial for seditious libel.&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

The council were not sure what to do, but summoned the Bishops to appear before them on Friday 8 June,&lt;ref&gt;Milne-Tyte, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; which became known as Black Friday.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Babington Macaulay|Macaulay, Thomas Babington]], ''The History Of England From the Accession of James II'', Vol. II, Chapter VIII, [[Donohue, Henneberry &amp; Co.]], 1890, p. 332. [[s:The History Of England From the Accession of James II/Chapter VIII#II.332]].&lt;/ref&gt; The bishops could have given their own [[recognizance]]s for coming up for trial, and thereby avoided being imprisoned before their trial. Sancroft had urged this; even Compton agreed to it; but Sancroft changed his mind. The bishops seem to have been angling for a delay in the trial proceedings – by refusing to give recognizances, they would have the right to delay the trial until the beginning of Michaelmas term on 23 October. The king, however, wanted a speedy trial, and the only way to get it, apart from convincing the Bishops to give their own recognizances, was to imprison them in the [[Tower of London]] before their trial; within the Tower, however, they had complete freedom.  Their imprisonment lasted only a week and had the effect, desired by the king, of speeding up the proceedings so that a trial could be held in June.&lt;ref&gt;Sowerby, Scott, ''Making Toleration: The Repealers and the Glorious Revolution'', Harvard University Press, 2013, pp. 178-81.&lt;/ref&gt; But, in [[Hilaire Belloc]]'s deliberately ironic words, "Compton had had the satisfaction of seeing a vast popular gathering acclaiming these fathers in God on the way to the horrid dungeon of a Tyrant."&lt;ref&gt;Belloc, Hilaire, "James the Second", Faber &amp; Gwyer, 1928, p. 216. The section from "The Declaration of Indulgence had originally" to this quotation is paraphrased from this book.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[George Jeffreys, 1st Baron Jeffreys|Lord Jeffreys]], the [[Lord Chancellor]], advised the King to drop the prosecution; on being overruled he asked caustically if the King was prepared to take advice from his Ministers   or whether "the Virgin Mary is to do all".&lt;ref&gt;Milne-Tyte, p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial==
The trial took place at the Court of [[King's Bench]] on 29 June, with Sir [[Thomas Powys (judge)|Thomas Powys]] the Attorney General and [[Sir William Williams, 1st Baronet, of Gray's Inn|William Williams]] the Solicitor General prosecuting and Sir [[Robert Wright (judge)|Robert Wright]], the [[Lord Chief Justice]] as the presiding judge, sitting with [[John Powell (judge)|John Powell]], Richard Holloway and [[Richard Allibond]]. The bishops had a formidable team of defence counsel, headed by [[Francis Pemberton]], a former Lord Chief Justice, and including former Attorneys General [[Robert Sawyer (Attorney General)|Sir Robert Sawyer]] and [[Sir Creswell Levinz]], as well as [[John Somers, 1st Baron Somers|John Somers]], a future [[Lord Chancellor]].&lt;ref name=K391&gt;Kenyon, J.P., ''The Stuart Constitution'', 2nd Edition, Cambridge University Press, 1986, p. 391.&lt;/ref&gt; The jury deliberated all night and the bishops were found not guilty on the morning of 30 June. There was great rejoicing; those opposed to the royal dispensing power had gained their victory.

The verdict was a  political disaster for the Government, largely due to its own ineptitude. Of the four judges only Allibond, a [[Roman Catholic]], showed any real desire for a conviction, while Powell and Holloway would clearly be happy with an acquittal. Powys,  the Attorney General,  through sheer incompetence,   almost caused the case to collapse at the outset by failing to prove that the Petition had been presented at all;&lt;ref name=K391/&gt;  Williams, the Solicitor General, handled the case with greater skill, but his bitter personal feud with  Lord Chief Justice Wright  (who in the course of his summing-up to the jury  accused him, without any relevance whatever to the trial,  of taking bribes)&lt;ref&gt;Kenyon, p. 409.&lt;/ref&gt; can scarcely have helped  the prosecution. A modern historian remarked that the trial "had a strong element of the grotesque".&lt;ref name=K391/&gt;

==Bishops==

The Seven Bishops were:

* [[William Sancroft]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]
* [[Thomas Ken]], [[Bishop of Bath and Wells]]
* [[John Lake (bishop)|John Lake]], [[Bishop of Chichester]]
* [[William Lloyd (bishop of Worcester)|William Lloyd]], [[Bishop of St Asaph]]
* [[Sir Jonathan Trelawny, 3rd Baronet|Jonathan Trelawny]], [[Bishop of Bristol]]
* [[Francis Turner (bishop)|Francis Turner]], [[Bishop of Ely]]
* [[Thomas White (bishop)|Thomas White]], [[Bishop of Peterborough]]

Despite their petition and their trial, five of these bishops (all but Lloyd and Trelawny) remained loyal to James II after the [[Glorious Revolution]] and were among the nine bishops who became [[Nonjuring schism|non-juror]]s, refusing to swear an oath of allegiance to [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]], and losing their bishoprics as a result.

==Rights of petition and religion==
The bishops exercised the right to petition preserved in ''[[Magna Carta]]'' (1215) (clause 61). The following year Parliament cited James II's trial of the Seven Bishops as a grievance. It explicitly preserved the right of petition in the [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights]] (1689).
&lt;blockquote&gt;"[T]he said Lords Spiritual and Temporal and Commons,&amp;nbsp;... do in the first place (as their ancestors in like case have usually done) for the vindicating and asserting their ancient rights and liberties declare&amp;nbsp;...
That it is the right of the subjects to petition the king, and all commitments and prosecutions for such petitioning are illegal;&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
These rights of petition for redress of grievances and of religion and conscience were preserved in the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]].

The '''seventy disciples''' or '''seventy-two disciples''' (known in the [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian]] traditions as the '''Seventy[-two] Apostles''') were early emissaries of [[Jesus]] mentioned in the [[Gospel of Luke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Luke|10:1–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Luke, the only [[gospel]] in which they appear, Jesus appointed them and sent them out in pairs on a specific mission which is detailed in the text.

In [[Western Christianity]], they are usually referred to as [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05029a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: Disciple]: "The disciples, in this disciples, in this context, are not the crowds of believers who flocked around Christ, but a smaller body of His followers. They are commonly identified with the seventy-two (seventy, according to the received Greek text, although several Greek manuscripts mention seventy-two, as does the Vulgate) referred to ({{bibleref2|Luke|10:1}}) as having been chosen by Jesus. The names of these disciples are given in several lists (Chronicon Paschale, and Pseudo-Dorotheus in Migne, P.G., XCII, 521–524; 543–545; 1061–1065); but these lists are unfortunately worthless."&lt;/ref&gt; whereas in Eastern Christianity they are usually referred to as [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ocafs.oca.org/FeastSaintsLife.asp?FSID=100017|title=Synaxis of the Seventy Apostles|work=oca.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the original [[Greek language|Greek words]], both titles are descriptive, as an ''apostle'' is one sent on a [[Mission (Christian)|mission]] (the Greek uses the verb form: ''apesteilen'') whereas a ''disciple'' is a student, but the two traditions differ on the scope of the words ''apostle'' and ''disciple''. Although apostles and disciples exist in many extant churches and denominations, the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] is the only current one to use [[Seventy (Latter Day Saints)|Seventy]] as a title for a priesthood office.&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=The Doctrine and Covenants|book=Section 107|verse=25|showsource=x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Text ==

The passage from [[Luke 10]] reads (in [[Young's Literal Translation]]):{{quote|
And after these things, the Lord did appoint also other seventy, and sent them by twos before his face, to every city and place whither he himself was about to come, then said he unto them, `The harvest indeed [is] abundant, but the workmen few; beseech ye then the Lord of the harvest, that He may put forth workmen to His harvest.

`Go away; lo, I send you forth as lambs in the midst of wolves; carry no bag, no scrip, nor sandals; and salute no one on the way;  and into whatever house ye do enter, first say, Peace to this house; and if indeed there may be there the son of peace, rest on it shall your peace; and if not so, upon you it shall turn back. `And in that house remain, eating and drinking the things they have, for worthy [is] the workman of his hire; go not from house to house, and into whatever city ye enter, and they may receive you, eat the things set before you, and heal the ailing in it, and say to them, The reign of God hath come nigh to you.

`And into whatever city ye do enter, and they may not receive you, having gone forth to its broad places, say, And the dust that hath cleaved to us, from your city, we do wipe off against you, but this know ye, that the reign of God hath come nigh to you; and I say to you, that for Sodom in that day it shall be more tolerable than for that city. `Wo to thee, Chorazin; wo to thee, Bethsaida; for if in Tyre and Sidon had been done the mighty works that were done in you, long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes, they had reformed; but for Tyre and Sidon it shall be more tolerable in the judgment than for you. `And thou, Capernaum, which unto the heaven wast exalted, unto hades thou shalt be brought down. `He who is hearing you, doth hear me; and he who is putting you away, doth put me away; and he who is putting me away, doth put away Him who sent me.'

And the seventy turned back with joy, saying, `Sir, and the demons are being subjected to us in thy name;' and he said to them, `I was beholding the Adversary, as lightning from the heaven having fallen; lo, I give to you the authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions, and on all the power of the enemy, and nothing by any means shall hurt you; but, in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subjected to you, but rejoice rather that your names were written in the heavens.'&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Luke|10:1–20|YLT}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Analysis ==
This is the only mention of the group in the [[Bible]]. The number is ''seventy'' in some manuscripts of the [[Alexandrian text-type|Alexandrian]] (such as [[Codex Sinaiticus]]) and [[Caesarean text-type|Caesarean]] text traditions but ''seventy-two'' in most other Alexandrian and [[Western text-type|Western]] texts. It may derive from the [[Sons of Noah|seventy nations of Genesis 10]] or the many other occurrences of the number seventy in the Bible, or the seventy-two translators of the [[Septuagint]] from the [[Letter of Aristeas]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce Metzger]]'s ''Textual Commentary on the Greek NT''&lt;/ref&gt; In translating the ''[[Vulgate]]'', [[Jerome]] selected the reading of seventy-two.

The ''Gospel of Luke'' is not alone among the [[synoptic gospels]] in containing multiple episodes in which Jesus sends out his followers on missions. The first occasion ({{bibleref2|Luke|9:1–6}}) is closely based on the "limited commission" mission in ''[[Gospel of Mark|Mark]]'' {{bibleref2|Mark|6:6–13}}, which however recounts the sending out of the [[twelve apostles]], rather than seventy, though with similar details. The parallels (also [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] {{bibleref2|Matthew|9:35}}, {{bibleref2|Matthew|10:1}}, {{bibleref2|Matthew|10:5–42}}) suggest a common origin in the hypothesized [[Q document]]. Luke also mentions the [[Great Commission]] to "all nations" ({{bibleref2|Luke|24:44–49}}) but in less detail than Matthew's account and {{bibleverse|Mark|16:19–20}} mentions the [[Dispersion of the Apostles]].

What has been said to the seventy (two) in {{bibleref2|Luke|10:4}} is referred in passing to the Twelve in {{bibleref2|Luke|22:35}}:
:He said to them, "When I sent you forth without a money bag or a sack or sandals, were you in need of anything?" "No, nothing," they replied.

The [[feast day]] commemorating the seventy is known as the "[[Synaxis]] of the Seventy Apostles" in Eastern Orthodoxy, and is celebrated on [[January 4 (Eastern Orthodox liturgics)|January 4]]. Each of the seventy apostles also has individual commemorations scattered throughout the [[liturgical year]] (see [[Eastern Orthodox Church calendar]]).

== The record by Pseudo-Hippolytus ==
[[Hippolytus of Rome]] was a disciple of [[Irenaeus]], a disciple of [[Polycarp]], a disciple of [[Apostle John]]. Hippolytus's works were considered lost prior to their discovery at a monastery on [[Mount Athos]] in 1854.&lt;ref&gt;Ante-Nicean Fathers, ed. Alexander Roberts, James Donaldson and A. Cleaveland Coxe, vol. 5 (Peabody MA: Hendrickson Publishers, 1999), 3&lt;/ref&gt; While his major work ''The Refutation of All Heresies'' was readily accepted (once the false attribution to Origen was resolved), his two small works, ''On the Twelve Apostles of Christ'' and ''On the Seventy Apostles of Christ'', are still regarded as dubious, put in the appendix of his works in the voluminous collection of the writings of early church fathers.&lt;ref&gt;Ante-Nicean Fathers, ed. Alexander Roberts, James Donaldson and A. Cleaveland Coxe, vol. 5 (Peabody MA: Hendrickson Publishers, 1999), 254–56&lt;/ref&gt; Here is the complete text of Pseudo-Hippolytus's ''On the Seventy Apostles of Christ'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;
# [[James the Just|James the Lord's brother]], bishop of Jerusalem.
# [[Cleopas]], bishop of Jerusalem.
# [[Saint Matthias|Matthias]], who supplied the vacant place in the number of the twelve apostles.
# [[Thaddeus of Edessa|Thaddeus]], who conveyed the epistle to Augarus ([[Abgar V]]).
# [[Ananias of Damascus|Ananias]], who baptized Paul, and was bishop of Damascus.
# [[St Stephen|Stephen]], the first martyr.
# [[Philip the Evangelist|Philip]], who baptized the eunuch.
# [[Prochorus (deacon)|Prochorus]], bishop of Nicomedia, who also was the first that departed, 11 believing together with his daughters.
# [[Nicanor the Deacon|Nicanor]] died when Stephen was martyred.
# [[Timon the Deacon|Timon]], bishop of Bostra.
# [[Parmenas]], bishop of Soli.
# [[Nicolas the Deacon|Nicolaus]], bishop of Samaria.
# [[Barnabas]], bishop of Milan.
# [[Mark the Evangelist]], bishop of Alexandria.
# [[Luke the Evangelist]].
These two belonged to the seventy disciples who were scattered by the offence of the word which Christ spoke, “Except a man eat my flesh, and drink my blood, he is not worthy of me.” But the one being induced to return to the Lord by Peter’s instrumentality, and the other by Paul’s, they were honored to preach that Gospel on account of which they also suffered martyrdom, the one being burned, and the other being crucified on an olive tree.

[[File:Women are Persons-two.jpg|thumb|right|[[Louise McKinney]] and [[Henrietta Muir Edwards]], Famous Five statue, [[Parliament Hill]], [[Ottawa]]]]
'''The Famous Five''', or '''The Valiant Five''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kome|first=Penney|title=Women of Influence: Canadian Women and Politics|year=1985|publisher=Doubleday Canada|location=Toronto|isbn=978-0-385-23140-4|pages=31–32|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=CBF8UvjlN8KiyAGu3IHwDg&amp;id=hBQqAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22valiant+five%22+emily+murphy&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22valiant+five%22|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{Lang-fr|Célèbres cinq}}) were five Alberta women who asked the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] to answer the question, "Does the word 'Persons' in Section 24 of the [[Constitution Act, 1867|British North America Act, 1867]], include female persons?" in the case ''[[Edwards v Canada (AG)|Edwards v Canada]].''&lt;ref name=Brennan&gt;{{cite book | first=Brian| last=Brennan| title=Alberta Originals: Stories of Albertans Who Made a Difference| year=2001| publisher= Fifth House| page= 14| isbn= 1-894004-76-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The five women, [[Emily Murphy]], [[Irene Parlby|Irene Marryat Parlby]], [[Nellie McClung|Nellie Mooney McClung]], [[Louise McKinney|Louise Crummy McKinney]] and [[Henrietta Muir Edwards]], created a petition to ask this question. They fought to have women legally considered persons so that women could be appointed to the Senate. The petition was filed on August 27, 1927,&lt;ref name="Alberta1999"&gt;{{cite book| title=Alberta History| volume=47–49| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jL06AQAAIAAJ&amp;q=famous+five+persons+case+august+27&amp;dq=famous+five+persons+case+august+27| accessdate=May 10, 2013| year=1999| publisher=Historical Society of Alberta}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on April 24, 1928, Canada's Supreme Court summarized its unanimous decision that women are not such "persons".&lt;ref name = Brennan/&gt;

The last line of the judgement reads, "Understood to mean 'Are women eligible for appointment to the [[Senate of Canada]],' the question is answered in the negative." This judgement was overturned by the British [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] on October 18, 1929. This case came to be known as the "[[Persons Case]]". Although Canadian women (those who were British/Canadian citizens) had the vote in many provinces and in federal elections by 1929, the case was part of a continent-wide drive for political equality, coming seven years after discrimination against women's voting rights was prohibited in the United States through the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], and thus had important ramifications.

Some saw this as "radical change"; others saw it as a restoration of the original framing of the English constitutional documents, including the [[1689 Bill of Rights]], which uses only the term "person", not the term "man" (or "woman" for that matter).

Some others have interpreted the Privy Council rule as causing a change in the Canadian judicial approach to the [[Constitution of Canada|Canadian constitution]], an approach that has come to be known as the "[[living tree doctrine]]".

==The Five==
The famous five women were:

* [[Emily Murphy]] (1868–1933), the [[British Empire]]'s first female judge;
* [[Irene Parlby|Irene Marryat Parlby]] (1868–1965), farm women's leader, political activist and first female [[Cabinet minister]] in Alberta, still serving in that capacity at the time of the court case;
* [[Nellie McClung|Nellie Mooney McClung]] (1873–1951), a [[suffragist]] and author, member of the Alberta Legislature 1921–1926;
* [[Louise McKinney|Louise Crummy McKinney]] (1868–1931), the first woman elected to the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta]], or any legislature in Canada or the rest of the British Empire, but no longer MLA at the time of the court case;
* [[Henrietta Muir Edwards]] (1849–1931), an advocate for working women, author and a founding member of the [[Victorian Order of Nurses]].

===Emily Murphy===
{{Main|Emily Murphy}}
Emily Murphy stood out in the famous five, bringing them to a victory in 1929. Emily was appointed to the office of Magistrate of the Edmonton Juvenile Court in 1916 and later became the magistrate of the newly created Women's Court. At the time, no woman had held such a position and many men objected.&lt;ref name=MacEwan&gt;{{cite book |first=Grant| last=MacEwan| title=...and Mighty Women too: Stories of Notable Western Canadian Women| year=1975| publisher= Western Producer Prairie Books| isbn=978-0919306653}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During her career as a writer, Murphy used the pen name "Janey Canuck". In 1922, she wrote ''The Black Candle'' which detailed her beliefs on race and drug use in Canada and strongly influenced the drug policy of the day. Murphy came from a privileged background in which white women were protected from many topics.&lt;ref name="Millar"&gt;{{cite book |first=Nancy |last=Millar |title=The Famous Five: Five Canadian Women and Their Fight to Become Persons |year=1999 |publisher=Western Heritage Centre| isbn=978-0920109168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Irene Parlby===
{{Main|Irene Parlby}}
In 1916, Irene Parlby was elected as the first president of the United Farm Women of Alberta and in 1921, was elected to the Alberta legislature and received a cabinet post in the United Farmers of Alberta government, becoming the second woman in the British Empire to hold ministerial rank. She served as cabinet minister until the downfall of the government in 1935. Parlby worked with the Red Cross during [[World War I]] and later served on the Board of Governors of the [[University of Alberta]].&lt;ref name=MacEwan/&gt;

Louise McKinney became one of the first two women elected to a legislature in the British Empire, and the first to take her seat. She was a founder of the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]] in Alberta and the West – she served as the organization's vice-president for more than 22 years beginning in 1906 – and regularly attended World Meetings of the WCTU. She signed the appeal to the Privy Council in 1929. In 1931, she became president of the Canadian Union, Woman's Christian Temperance Union.

===Honorary senators===
None of the five became [[Senate of Canada#Senators|senators]]; the first female senator was Quebecer [[Cairine Reay Wilson]], appointed four months after the ruling. Nearly 80 years later, on October 8, 2009, the Senate voted to make the five the first "honorary senators".&lt;ref name=cbc&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/story/2009/10/10/calgary-famous-five-honourary-senators.html |title='Famous 5' named honorary senators |work=[[CBC News]] |publisher=CBC.ca |date=October 10, 2009 |accessdate=May 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hansard&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/common/..%5C40%5C2%5Cparlbus%5Cchambus%5Csenate/deb-E/059db_2009-10-08-e.htm?Language=E&amp;Parl=40&amp;Ses=2#53|title=Senate of Canada – Debates|first=Senate of|last=Canada|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The achievement of personhood for women had been a monumental change which gave more power to women.

Some might well question the overall significance of the decision, noting that by the 1920s the Senate of Canada was a largely powerless body. The more powerful [[House of Commons of Canada]] had elected its first female member ([[Agnes Macphail]]) in 1921, well before the Persons Case. However, the precedent did establish the principle that women could hold any political office in Canada. Moreover, the Five clearly did devote their energies to increasing women's participation on legislative bodies with greater power: three had been members of the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta|Alberta legislature]]. The controversy surrounding the women has made commemoration difficult.{{Citation needed|date = August 2012}} The five women were activists in a variety of areas in their pursuit to better the conditions for women and children.

===Opinions on the Famous Five===
Opinions on the Famous Five vary considerably. Many laud them as trailblazers for women. Others are disturbed by the opinions of some of the women on other issues, such as opposition to non-white immigration and their successful campaigns to have [[eugenics]] legislation introduced in Canadian provinces, which resulted in the sterilization of thousands of those deemed "mentally deficient" or "insane" in Alberta and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/eugenics-keeping-canada-sane-feature/&lt;/ref&gt; Emily Murphy was not shy with her opinions and her outspoken nature had a tendency to give her a negative reputation. She wrote letters of her opinions to police chiefs, government officials, social service agencies and judicial officials about the extent of drug traffic and possible cures. Nellie McClung was known as the most memorable and popular of the famous five. Her causes included women's right to vote, prohibition, women in the church and women in public life.&lt;ref name=Millar/&gt;  Henrietta Muir Edwards was described as "tenacious" with her work with prohibition.&lt;ref name=MacEwan/&gt;

The five women were activists in a variety of areas in their pursuit to better the conditions for women and children. Emily Murphy dealt with single mothers and issues of child support, child welfare, and adoption by lobbying for women's rights.&lt;ref name = Sharpe&gt;{{cite book| first=Robert J.| last=Sharpe| title=The Persons Case: The Origins and Legacy of the Fight for Legal Personhood| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HOwC1vcGgcEC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=4| isbn=978-0802096289| year=2007| publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nellie McClung favoured free medical and dental treatment for school children as well as mothers' allowances and better property rights for women. She was open to divorce and birth control but opposed the sale and use of liquor. Louise McKinney believed strongly in the "evils of alcohol" and pushed to enact prohibition measures. She advocated excluding cigarettes from parcels sent to soldiers in World War&amp;nbsp;I in 1917. She supported reasonable measures for social welfare and health as well as introducing bills intended to make prohibition more effective, to improve the lot of immigrants and bring better security to widows. She was responsible for the introduction of a motion which led to the [[Dower Act]]. Irene Parlby in her position as cabinet minister in Alberta pursued these goals expressed by McKinney. Henrietta Edwards worked with property law and sought to protect women and children.&lt;ref name=Millar/&gt;

===Commemorations===
The Famous Five have been commemorated with individual and group plaques in the [[Centre Block#Senate foyer|foyer]] and antechamber of Canada's Senate, and two identical sculptures by Canadian artist [[Barbara Paterson]], one on [[Parliament Hill]] in [[Ottawa]], the other at the [[Olympic Plaza (Calgary)|Olympic Plaza]] in [[Calgary]]. The sculpture on Parliament Hill was unveiled on October 18, 2000, in a public ceremony that included [[French language in Canada|French]] and [[Canadian English|English]] singers, [[Inuit]] dancers, and speeches by [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] [[Adrienne Clarkson]] and [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Jean Chrétien]]. A sculpture of the Famous Five by sculptor Helen Granger Young stands on the grounds of the Manitoba Legislature in Winnipeg. Commissioned by the Nellie McClung Foundation, it was unveiled at a ceremony on June 18, 2010.

The City of [[Edmonton]] has named one park in its River Valley Parks System after each of the "Famous Five".&lt;ref name="edmonton"&gt;{{cite web| title=Alphabetical Park Listing| url=http://www.edmonton.ca/attractions_recreation/parks_rivervalley/alphabetical-park-listing.aspx| publisher=City of Edmonton| date=May 14, 2012| accessdate=May 14, 2012| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121127115516/http://edmonton.ca/attractions_recreation/parks_rivervalley/alphabetical-park-listing.aspx| archivedate=November 27, 2012| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Murphy had many accomplishments, such as becoming the first president of the Federated Women's Institute of Canada, vice-president of [[National Council of Women]] of Canada, president of [[Canadian Women's Press Club]], director of the Canadian Council of Child Welfare, vice-president of the Canadian Association of Child Protection, first president of the Women's Canadian Club of Edmonton and vice-president of the Social Service Council of Canada. Emily Murphy also received many honours for her life's work including being decorated by King [[George V]] to be a Lady of Grace of the [[Order of Saint John (chartered 1888)|Order of St. John of Jerusalem]].

Irene Parlby was honoured in 1935 at spring convocation at the [[University of Alberta]] with an honorary LL.D. degree. Tributes in honour of Henrietta Edwards can be found on a plaque in the Senate Chamber in Ottawa and another in the post office in Fort Macleod. Nellie McClung spoke in Calgary after Edwards' passing and spoke of Edwards, "who for 40 years was convener of laws for the National Council of Women" should not be forgotten.&lt;ref name="MacEwan" /&gt;

Along with [[Thérèse Casgrain]], the Five were commemorated in the 2001 [[Journey Series (banknotes)|Journey Series]] of Canada's [[Canadian fifty-dollar bill|fifty-dollar bill]].&lt;ref name=Brennan/&gt;  In December 2011, the [[Bank of Canada]] announced that the Famous Five would not appear on the redesigned $50 [[Frontier Series]] banknote that it issued in 2012.&lt;ref name="50dollars"&gt;{{cite news| title=Should the new $50 bill show an Arctic research boat instead of the Famous Five?| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/yourcommunity/2011/12/should-the-new-50-bill-show-an-arctic-research-boat-instead-of-the-famous-five.html| work=CBC News| date=December 7, 2011| publisher=cbc.ca| accessdate=May 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The achievement of personhood for women had been a monumental change which gave more power to women. To honour the Five and continue to involve women in leadership roles in Canada, Frances Wright and others established the non-profit Famous Five Foundation on October 18, 1996, the 70th anniversary of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council's decision.&lt;ref name="5foundation"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.famous5.ca/index.php/about-us/about-us| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121225022456/http://www.famous5.ca/index.php/about-us/about-us| dead-url=yes| archive-date=December 25, 2012| title=About Us| publisher=Famous 5 Foundation| date=| accessdate=May 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Twelve Imams''' are the spiritual and political successors to the [[Islam]]ic prophet [[Muhammad]] in the [[Twelver]] or ''Athnā‘ashariyyah'' branch of [[Shia Islam]], including that of the [[Alawite]] and the [[Alevi]] sects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Olsson|Ozdalga|Raudvere|2005|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the [[theology of Twelvers]], also the Twelve Imams are exemplary human individuals who not only rule over the community with justice, but also are able to keep and interpret ''[[sharia]]'' and the [[Esoteric interpretation of the Quran|esoteric meaning of the Quran]]. Muhammad and Imams' [[Sunnah|words and deeds]] are a guide and model for the community to follow; as a result, they must be free from error and sin (known as ''[[ismah]]'', or infallibility) and must be chosen by divine decree, or ''[[Nass (Islam)|nass]]'', through the Prophet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tabataba'i|1977|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Momen|1985|p=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Twelvers1 copy copy.png|thumb|Calligraphic representation of the Twelve Imams along with that of the Prophet Muhammad.]]
==The belief of Imamah==
{{main|Imamate (Twelver doctrine)}}
It is believed in [[Twelver]] [[Shia Islam]] that [[Aql (Shiasm)|‘aql]], divine wisdom, is the source of the souls of the Prophets and Imams and gives them esoteric knowledge called ''[[Hikmah]]'' and that their sufferings are a means of divine grace to their devotees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tabataba'i|1977|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Corbin|2014|pp=45–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Imam is not the recipient of a [[wahy|divine revelation]], he has a close relationship with [[Allah|God]], through which God guides him, and the Imam in turn guides the people. The Imams are also guided by secret texts in their possession, such as [[Al-Jafr (book)|al-Jafr]] and [[al-Jamia]]. [[Imamate]], or belief, in the divine guide is a fundamental belief in the Twelver Shia doctrine and is based on the concept that God would not leave humanity without access to divine guidance.&lt;ref name="Imamat"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = Encyclopaedia of Islam and the Muslim world; vol.1  | last = Gleave | first = Robert | title=Imamate | publisher = MacMillan | ISBN = 0-02-865604-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Twelvers, there is at all times an Imam of the era who is the divinely appointed authority on all matters of faith and law in the Muslim community. [[Ali]] was the first of the Twelve Imams, and, in the Twelvers and Sufis' view, the [[Succession to Muhammad|rightful successor to Muhammad]], followed by male [[descendants of Muhammad]] through his daughter [[Fatimah]]. Each Imam was the son of the previous Imam, with the exception of [[Husayn ibn Ali]], who was the brother of [[Hasan ibn Ali]]. The twelfth and final Imam is [[Muhammad al-Mahdi]], who is believed by the Twelvers to be currently alive, and hidden in [[The Occultation#Major Occultation|the Major Occultation]] until he returns to bring justice to the world.&lt;ref name="Imamat" /&gt; It is believed by [[Twelver]] [[Shia]] and [[Alevi]] [[Muslims]] that the Twelve Imams have been foretold in the [[Hadith of the Twelve Successors]]. All of the Imams met unnatural deaths, with the exception of the last Imam, who according to Twelver and Alevi belief, is living in occultation.

The Twelve Imams also have a leading role within some [[Sufism|Sufi]] orders and are seen as the spiritual heads of Islam, because most of the [[Silsila]] ''(spiritual chain)'' of Sufi orders lead back to one of the Twelve Imams.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3026">'''''Theophanes Continuatus''''' ({{lang-el|συνεχισταί Θεοφάνους}}) or '''''Scriptores post Theophanem''''' ({{lang|grc|Οἱ μετὰ Θεοφάνην}}, "those after Theophanes") is the [[Latin]] name commonly applied to a collection of historical writings preserved in the 11th-century Vat. gr. 167 manuscript.&lt;ref name="ODB2061"&gt;Kazhdan (1991), p. 2061&lt;/ref&gt; Its name derives from its role as the continuation, covering the years 813–961, of the [[chronicle]] of [[Theophanes the Confessor]], which reaches from 285 to 813. The manuscript consists of four distinct works, in style and form very unlike the [[annals|annalistic]] approach of Theophanes.&lt;ref name="ODB"&gt;Kazhdan (1991), pp. 2061–2062&lt;/ref&gt;

The first work, of four books consists of a series of biographies of the emperors reigning from 813 to 867 (from [[Leo the Armenian]] to [[Michael III]]). As they were commissioned by Emperor [[Constantine VII]] (r. 913–959), they reflect the point of view of the reigning [[Macedonian dynasty]]. The unknown author probably used the same sources as [[Genesios]].&lt;ref name="ODB"/&gt; The second work is known as the ''Vita Basilii'' (Latin for "Life of Basil"), a biography of [[Basil I the Macedonian]] (r. 867–886) written by his grandson Constantine VII probably around 950. The work is essentially a [[panegyric]], praising Basil and his reign while vilifying his predecessor, Michael III.&lt;ref&gt;Kazhdan (1991), pp. 2062, 2180–2181&lt;/ref&gt; The third work is a history of the years 886–948, in form and content very close to the history of [[Symeon Logothetes]], and the final section continues it until 961. It was probably written by [[Theodore Daphnopates]], shortly before 963.&lt;ref&gt;Kazhdan (1991), p. 2062&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Martyrs==
* '''[[José Dizon|Jose M. Dizon]]''' -  was a Filipino patriot who was among those who founded the [[Katipunan]] that sparked the [[Philippine Revolution]]. Dizon was born in [[Binondo, Manila]]. In April 1892, he was inducted into the freemasonic lodge founded by Pedro Serrano Laktaw. That same year, he founded the lodge Taliba in Trozo, Manila and served as its venerable master. He was also among the officers of the grand regional council that included [[Apolinario Mabini]].
* '''Domingo Franco''' - Born in [[Mambusao, Capiz]], Franco was the third among the six children of Juan Franco and Ciriaca Tuason. His father worked as procurador judicial, or solicitor, in the local justice of the peace court. He kept in his care the documents of the [[La Liga Filipina]] as ordered by [[José Rizal|Jose Rizal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.msc.edu.ph/centennial/hero/wv/page3.html|title=WESTERN VISAYAS, Philippines Unsung Heroes|website=www.msc.edu.ph|access-date=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Numeriano Adriano''' - A reformist, Adriano was one of those executed by the Spaniards soon after the revolution in 1896 broke out. He was the eldest of the seven children of Pioquinto Adriano and Agapita Resurreccion of Beata, [[Pandacan, Manila]]. Adriano enrolled in the [[University of Santo Tomas]], but it is not known whether he finished a degree. For twenty years, he worked in the third branch of the Court of the First Instance as clerk of court.
* '''Moises Salvador''' - was a contractor, mason, and propagandist. Salvador was born in San Sebastian which was formerly a part of [[Quiapo, Manila]]. He was the son of Ambrosio Salvador, founding president of the [[La Liga Filipina]], and Acosta Francisco.
* '''Faustino Villaruel''' - a merchant from [[Pandacan, Manila]]. A mason and one of the founding member of the [[La Liga Filipina]], and supporter of the propaganda movement.
* '''Francisco L. Roxas''' - was a businessman, musician and a second cousin of one of the richest men in the [[Philippines]] at that time, Don Pedro Pablo Roxas. He was born in [[Binondo, Manila]].
* '''Luis Enciso Villareal''' - was a member of the Propaganda Movement. Villareal was born in [[Daraga, Albay]]. His father, Francisco Villareal, was known to be a “wonderful fiddler” and a graceful dancer. Meanwhile, his mother was Maria Espinas. His parents own an abaca plantation. He was initially enrolled in the town school but was later sent to a seminary in [[Naga, Camarines Sur|Naga City]] where he finished with a bachelor of arts degree.
* '''Geronimo M. Cristobal''' - He was an infantry corporal in the regiment known by the nickname “Burgos.” As he stood there facing the array of guns pointed menacingly at him and his companions, he must have thought it rather unreal that he should meet his fate at the hand of his former comrades-in-arms, some of whom could be his friends.
* '''Antonio Salazar''' - Salazar y San Agustin was one of the 13 Masons and revolutionaries who were executed by the Spanish authorities.
* '''Ramon Padilla''' - Padilla at the time of the outbreak of the Revolution in 1896 was said to be a clerk at the Comandancia de la Marina (Navy).
* '''Braulio Rivera''' - Born in Gitna (now renamed after him), [[Tondo, Manila]] near the corner of Zabala and Sto. Cristo Streets. Rivera was the son of Jose Rivera, a worker at the tobacco monopoly administration. Little is known of his early background: although only an elementary graduate, he was employed as a clerk at the “Sub-inspeccion General de Montes”. He was blessed with an exceptional singing voice thus, was inclined to singing. He was also an able musician who played three instruments - the guitar, violin and flute.
* '''Faustino Mañalac''' - He was a clerk in the Port of Manila administration and headed the Ilog Pasig council of the KKK in Binondo. A son of a carpenter at the naval shipyard in San Roque, Cavite, he became a member of the KKK Supreme Council using the alias "Mayon". Married to Marta Saldaña, who was a member of the KKK women's section along with Gregoria de Jesus, Maria Dizon, Josefa and Trinidad Rizal, Mañalac is listed among those who visited the Pamitinan caves with [[Andres Bonifacio]], [[Emilio Jacinto]], [[Aurelio Tolentino]], Guillermo Masangkay on Good Friday, 1895 and wrote about Philippine independence on the walls of the cave.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gutenberg.org/files/16656/16656-h/16656-h.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://docs.google.com/document/preview?hgd=1&amp;id=16yXRtEdRI5NtFkXamjeQJpRX8i6NUsLsBUUEgy3hTC4&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Benedicto P. Nijiga''' - During a raid of a printing press in Binondo, the Spaniards found and confiscated subversive documents including a list of members of the Katipunan. Benedicto Nijaga was on the list as a collector of revolutionary funds. Upon the order of Gov. Polavieja to arbitrarily arrest all suspected members of the Katipunan, Nijaga was arrested while he was campaigning for revolutionary funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://calbayogko.tripod.com/id1.html|title=History|website=calbayogko.tripod.com|access-date=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Witches Belvoir''' were a mother and her two daughters accused of [[witchcraft]] in England in the deaths of two young nobles, Henry (died 1613) and Francis Manners (died 1620), the heirs to [[Francis Manners, 6th Earl of Rutland]], whose seat was at [[Belvoir Castle]] . The mother, Joan Flower, died on the way to her trial, and the two daughters, Margaret and Philippa, were supposed to be hanged in [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]]. It is said that Phillipa drugged the guards and managed to escape and make her way to Kent where she died after having three children.

==Flowers of Bottesford==
Joan, Margaret and Philippa Flowers were "known to be herbal healers" and came from a local family that "had fallen on hard times".&lt;ref name="BBCFramed"&gt;{{cite news | title = Witches of Belvoir 'may have been framed' | date = 2013-10-31 | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-24748721 | work = BBC | accessdate = 2013-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; They accepted employment as servants with the [[Francis Manners, 6th Earl of Rutland|6th Earl and Countess of Rutland]], at [[Belvoir Castle]] near [[Grantham, Lincolnshire]], when additional staff were needed for an upcoming visit by [[James VI and I|King James I]].&lt;ref name="BBCFramed"/&gt; But the sisters, and their mother, were unpopular with the other staff, and there were suggestions of theft, and misdemeanors.&lt;ref name="BBCFramed"/&gt; All three were dismissed and only Joan was given a payment of severance amounting to "40 shillings, a bolster (pillow), and a mattress of wool".&lt;ref name="thiswasleics"&gt;{{cite news | title = The Witches of Belvoir Castle | date = 2012-11-12 | url = http://www.thiswasleicestershire.co.uk/2012/11/the-witches-of-belvoir-castle.html | work = This Was Leicestershire | accessdate = 2013-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the sisters were dismissed, the Earl and Countess fell ill, suffering from "vomiting and convulsions".&lt;ref name="thiswasleics"/&gt; Their son and heir, Henry, [[Baron de Ros]],&lt;ref name="bottshist"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bottesfordhistory.org.uk/page_id__61_path__0p4p72p.aspx | title = The Bottesford Witches, Introduction | accessdate = 2013-11-01 | last = Bob | first = Sparford | work = Bottesford Living History}}&lt;/ref&gt; died, and was buried on 26 September 1613.&lt;ref name="fleming"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Miller | first1 = William E. | title = The Library Chronicle | chapter = Samuel Fleming, Elizabethan Clergyman | volume = XXV | publisher = University of Pennsylvania | year = 1959 | pages = 61–79 | url = https://archive.org/stream/librarychronicle25univ#page/n7/mode/2up | accessdate = 2013-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their younger children, Francis, and daughter [[Katherine Villiers, Duchess of Buckingham|Katherine]], suffered similarly &lt;ref name="bygone"/&gt; and Francis died 7 March 1620. The deaths of the two boys left the Earl without a male heir and Earldom passed to his brother after his own death in 1632.&lt;ref name="burke"&gt;{{cite book |title= [[Burke's Peerage|Burke's Peerage, Baronetage &amp; Knighthood]]|publisher=Burke's Peerage &amp; Gentry |editor= Mosley, Charles |editorlink= Charles Mosley (genealogist) |edition=107 |year= 2003 |page= 3447 |ref=Burke |isbn=0-9711966-2-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charge of witchcraft==
Three years after Henry's death, on 16 July 1616, nine women were hanged as witches in [[Leicestershire]] for having bewitched a young boy and, in charges similar to those in the Flowers' case, were said to have kept cats as familiars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Briscoe | first1 = J.

[[Robert Bertie, 1st Earl of Lindsey|Robert Bertie, Lord Willoughby de Eresby]], Sir George Manners, Sir William Pelham, Sir Henry Hastings, clergyman Samuel Fleming and others,&lt;ref name="fleming"/&gt; the women were to be taken to [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]] [[gaol]].&lt;ref name="bookdays"/&gt;

When arrested Joan Flower professed her innocence. She was not known to be a Church-goer, but at [[Ancaster, Lincolnshire|Ancaster]], en route to the prison at [[Lincoln, England|Lincoln]],&lt;ref name="bygone"/&gt; she asked for bread as a substitute for the Eucharist.&lt;ref name="BormanRev"&gt;{{cite news | first = Bella | last = Bathurst | title = Witches: A Tale of Sorcery, Scandal and Seduction by Tracy Borman – review | date = 2013-08-25 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/aug/25/witches-sorcery-scandal-borman-review | work = The Guardian | accessdate = 2013-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; She claimed that something so blessed could not be consumed by a witch but she was to choke and die, after the first bite.&lt;ref name="BormanRev"/&gt;

At Lincoln, Margaret was to accuse her mother of witchcraft, while Phillipa admitted to witchcraft on behalf of herself, Margaret and Joan.&lt;ref name="fleming"/&gt; The sisters said they had entered into communion with [[familiar spirit]]s that had assisted them with their schemes. The mother's familiar was a cat named ''Rutterkin''.&lt;ref name="bookdays"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Chambers | first1 = Robert | title = The Book Of Days | chapter = March 11th | year = 1869 | url = http://www.thebookofdays.com/months/march/11.htm | accessdate = 2013-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The women admitted that they stole the glove of Lord Ros and gave it to their mother, who had dipped it in boiling water, stroked it along Rutterkin's back, and pricked it.&lt;ref name="bookdays"/&gt; Combined with some incantations this supposedly caused Lord Ros to become ill and die. An attempt to harm [[Katherine Villiers, Duchess of Buckingham|Lady Katherine]], the Earl's daughter, had failed when it was found that ''Rutterkin'' had no power over her. The women had also taken some feathers from the quilt of Rutland's bed and a pair of gloves. By boiling these in water mixed with blood they cast spells to prevent the Earl and Countess from having any more children.&lt;ref name="bookdays"/&gt; Both women admitted to experiencing visions of devils and that their familiar spirits visited them and sucked at their bodies.&lt;ref name="bookdays"/&gt;

==Others accused==
[[File:Threewitches.jpg|right|250px|thumb|left|A contemporary sketch of three other women accused: Anne Baker, Joan Willimot &amp; Ellen Greene.]]
During the examination, they revealed the names of other women who had aided them: Anne Baker of [[Bottesford, Leicestershire|Bottesford]]; Joan Willimot of [[Goadby, Leicestershire|Goadby]]; and Ellen Greene of [[Stathern]].&lt;ref name="bottshist2"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bottesfordhistory.org.uk/page_id__62_path__0p2p46p.aspx | title = The Bottesford Witches, The Wonderful Discovery of the Witchcrafts of Joan, Margaret and Phillipa Flower | accessdate = 2013-11-01 | last = Bob | first = Sparford | work = Bottesford Living History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All three women were taken for examination and revealed that they too had visions and consorted with familiar spirits.&lt;ref name="bottshist2"/&gt; Willimott said her familiar was called ''Pretty'' and had been blown into her mouth by her former master in the form of a fairy, later reappearing in the form of a woman who asked her to give up her soul. Willimott testified more as a [[Cunning folk in Britain|cunning woman]] than a witch, and insisted ''Pretty'' only helped her to inquire about the health of people she had attempted to heal:

{{quote|She never hurt any body, but did help divers persons that were stricken or fore-spoken (bewitched): and that her Spirit came weekly to her, and would tell of divers persons that were stricken and fore-spoken: and she saith that the use which she had of the Spirit, was to know those did which she had undertaken to amend and she did help them by certain prayers which she used.&lt;ref name="bottshist2"/&gt;}}

Greene claimed that she had accompanied Willimot into a wood where she said Willimot had conjured up two spirits in the form of a kitten and a "moldewarp" ([[mole (animal)|mole]]) which had climbed on her shoulders and sucked at her ears. Greene sent these familiars to kill a man and woman with whom she had argued and both died within a fortnight. Baker also confessed to possessing a familiar in the form of a white dog, but most of her testimony concerned the visions she had witnessed.

==Aftermath and legacy==
[[File:Inscription on Tomb of 6th Earl of Rutland.jpg|thumb|250px|alt=Images of memorial text at Bottesford|'died in their infancy by wicked practises and sorcerye' – part of the memorial at [[Bottesford, Leicestershire|Bottesford]]]]
Margaret and Philippa Flowers were tried before [[Sir Henry Hobart, 1st Baronet|Henry Hobart]], Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, and [[Edward Bromley]], a [[Exchequer of Pleas|Baron of the Exchequer]], and found guilty.&lt;ref name="fleming"/&gt; and Margaret was hung at [[Lincoln castle]] on 11 March 1619.&lt;ref name="BBCFramed"/&gt;

Later that year a ballad, ''Damnable Practises of Three Lincolnshire Witches Joane Flower and Her Two Daughters'', printed by 'G. Eld for John Barnes' appeared.&lt;ref name="fleming"/&gt;

The Earl and Countess remained so convinced that their son had been killed by the effects of witchcraft that they had it inscribed on their monument at [[Bottesford, Leicestershire|Bottesford]] church. It reads, in part:

{{quote|In 1608 he married ye lady Cecila Hungerford, daughter to ye Honorable Knight Sir John Tufton, by whom he had two sons, both of which died in their infancy by wicked practises and sorcerye&lt;ref name="bottshist"/&gt;}}

In 1953, Hilda Lewis published a historical romance, ''The Witch and the Priest'', which consists of a series of conversations between Samuel Fleming, the clergyman who oversaw the Flowers' examinations, and the ghost of Joan Flower.&lt;ref name="fleming"/&gt;

In 2013, historian Tracey Borman suggested that the Flowers women may have been framed by a favourite of [[James VI and I|King James I]], the [[Lincolnshire]] born George Villiers, who was created [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]] in 1623.&lt;ref name="BBCFramed"/&gt; Watson's theory is that Villiers had plans to marry the [[Francis Manners, 6th Earl of Rutland|Rutland's]] daughter [[Katherine Villiers, Duchess of Buckingham|Katherine]] and, with her two brothers dead, inherit the title.&lt;ref name="BBCFramed"/&gt; Watson argues 'he had them poisoned – then framed Joan Flower and her two daughters as witches to create a smokescreen to cover up his own guilt'.&lt;ref name="BBCFramed"/&gt; After the execution of the Flowers sisters, [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|Villiers]] went on to marry the [[Francis Manners, 6th Earl of Rutland|Rutland's]] sole heir [[Katherine Villiers, Duchess of Buckingham|Katherine]] on 16 May 1620.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Manners, Francis|volume=36|pages=49–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;
