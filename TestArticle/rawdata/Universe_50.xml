In [[physical cosmology]], the '''age of the universe''' is the [[cosmological time|time]] elapsed since the [[Big Bang]]. The [[Planck (spacecraft)#2015 data release|current measurement]] of the age of the [[universe]] is {{val|13.799|0.021}} billion (10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;) years&lt;!-- The universe is 8.07×10E60 "planck times" old, this is how much the observable universe has "ticked" since the plank epoch.
For reference, if we took a "supercomputer" capable of counting at plank speed, and have it count since the Big bang, it would have counted a number 203 bits long by now. (1.25×2E202) --&gt; within the [[Lambda-CDM model|Lambda-CDM concordance model]].&lt;ref name="Planck 2015"&gt;{{Cite journal

These include studies of the [[microwave background radiation]], and [[measurement]]s by the [[Planck satellite]], the [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe]] and other probes.

== Explanation ==
The [[Lambda-CDM model|Lambda-CDM concordance model]] describes the evolution of the universe from a very uniform, hot, dense primordial state to its present state over a span of about 13.8 billion years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[cosmological time]]. This model is well understood theoretically and strongly supported by recent high-precision [[astronomical observation]]s such as [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe|WMAP]]. In contrast, theories of the origin of the primordial state remain very speculative. If one extrapolates the Lambda-CDM model backward from the earliest well-understood state, it quickly (within a small fraction of a second) reaches a [[Gravitational singularity|singularity]]. This is known as the "[[initial singularity]]" or the "[[Big Bang]] singularity". This singularity is not understood as having a physical significance in the usual sense, but it is convenient to quote times measured "since the Big Bang" even though they do not correspond to a physically measurable time. For example, "10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang" is a well-defined era in the universe's evolution. If one referred to the same era as "13.8 billion years minus 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; seconds ago", the precision of the meaning would be lost because the minuscule latter time interval is eclipsed by uncertainty in the former.

Though the universe might in theory have a longer history, the [[International Astronomical Union]]&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; presently use "age of the universe" to mean the duration of the Lambda-CDM expansion, or equivalently the elapsed time since the Big Bang in the current [[observable universe]].

==Observational limits==
Since the universe must be at least as old as the oldest things in it, there are a number of observations which put a lower limit on the age of the universe; these include the temperature of the coolest [[white dwarf]]s, which gradually cool as they age, and the dimmest [[turnoff point]] of [[main sequence]] [[stars]] in clusters (lower-mass stars spend a greater amount of time on the main sequence, so the lowest-mass stars that have evolved off of the main sequence set a minimum age).

==Cosmological parameters==
[[Image:Mplwp universe scale evolution.svg|thumb|400px|The age of the universe can be determined by measuring the [[Hubble constant]] today and extrapolating back in time with the observed value of density parameters (Ω). Before the discovery of [[dark energy]], it was believed that the universe was matter-dominated ([[Einstein–de Sitter universe]], green curve). Note that the [[de Sitter universe]] has infinite age, while the [[Big Crunch|closed]] universe has the least age.]]
[[File:Age Universe Planck 2013.png|thumb|400px|The value of the age correction factor, ''F'', is shown as a function of two [[cosmology|cosmological parameters]]: the current fractional matter density Ω&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; and cosmological constant density Ω&lt;sub&gt;''Λ''&lt;/sub&gt;.  The [[Lambda-CDM model|best-fit values]] of these parameters are shown by the box in the upper left; the matter-dominated universe is shown by the star in the lower right.]]
The problem of determining the age of the universe is closely tied to the problem of determining the values of the cosmological parameters. Today this is largely carried out in the context of the [[Lambda CDM model|ΛCDM]] model, where the universe is assumed to contain normal (baryonic) matter, cold [[dark matter]], radiation (including both [[photon]]s and [[neutrino]]s), and a [[cosmological constant]].  The fractional contribution of each to the current energy density of the universe is given by the [[density parameter]]s Ω&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;, Ω&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;, and Ω&lt;sub&gt;Λ&lt;/sub&gt;.  The full ΛCDM model is described by a number of other parameters, but for the purpose of computing its age these three, along with the [[Hubble constant|Hubble parameter]] &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt;, are the most important.

If one has accurate measurements of these parameters, then the age of the universe can be determined by using the [[Friedmann equations|Friedmann equation]].  This equation relates the rate of change in the [[scale factor (cosmology)|scale factor]] ''a''(''t'') to the matter content of the universe.  Turning this relation around, we can calculate the change in time per change in scale factor and thus calculate the total age of the universe by [[Integral|integrating]] this formula. The age ''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is then given by an expression of the form
:&lt;math&gt;t_0 = \frac{1}{H_0} F(\Omega_r,\Omega_m,\Omega_\Lambda,\dots) &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Hubble's law|Hubble parameter]] and the function ''F'' depends only on the fractional contribution to the universe's energy content that comes from various components. The first observation that one can make from this formula is that it is the Hubble parameter that controls that age of the universe, with a correction arising from the matter and energy content. So a rough estimate of the age of the universe comes from the [[Hubble time]], the inverse of the Hubble parameter. With a value for &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt; around {{val|68|u=km/s/Mpc}}, the Hubble time evaluates to &lt;math&gt;1/H_0&lt;/math&gt; = {{val|14.4}} billion years.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To get a more accurate number, the correction factor ''F'' must be computed. In general this must be done numerically, and the results for a range of cosmological parameter values are shown in the figure. For the [[Lambda CDM model|Planck values]] (Ω&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;, Ω&lt;sub&gt;''Λ''&lt;/sub&gt;) = (0.3086, 0.6914), shown by the box in the upper left corner of the figure, this correction factor is about ''F'' = 0.956. For a flat universe without any cosmological constant, shown by the star in the lower right corner, ''F'' = {{Frac|2|3}} is much smaller and thus the universe is younger for a fixed value of the Hubble parameter. To make this figure, Ω&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; is held constant (roughly equivalent to holding the [[Cosmic Microwave Background|CMB]] temperature constant) and the curvature density parameter is fixed by the value of the other three.

Apart from the Planck satellite, the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe ([[WMAP]]) was instrumental in establishing an accurate age of the universe, though other measurements must be folded in to gain an accurate number.  [[CMB]] measurements are very good at constraining the matter content Ω&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is not as sensitive to Ω&lt;sub&gt;Λ&lt;/sub&gt; directly,&lt;ref name="anim3"/&gt; partly because the cosmological constant becomes important only at low redshift.  The most accurate determinations of the Hubble parameter ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; come from [[Type Ia supernova]]e.  Combining these measurements leads to the generally accepted value for the age of the universe quoted above.

The cosmological constant makes the universe "older" for fixed values of the other parameters. This is significant, since before the cosmological constant became generally accepted, the Big Bang model had difficulty explaining why [[globular cluster]]s in the Milky Way appeared to be far older than the age of the universe as calculated from the Hubble parameter and a matter-only universe.&lt;ref&gt;

==WMAP==
[[NASA]]'s [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe]] (WMAP) project's [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe#Nine-year data release|nine-year data release]] in 2012 estimated the age of the universe to be {{val|13.772|0.059|e=9}} years (13.772 billion years, with an uncertainty of plus or minus 59 million years).&lt;ref name="arxiv-20121220" /&gt;

However, this age is based on the assumption that the project's underlying model is correct; other methods of estimating the age of the universe could give different ages. Assuming an extra background of relativistic particles, for example, can enlarge the error bars of the WMAP constraint by one order of magnitude.&lt;ref&gt;

This measurement is made by using the location of the first acoustic peak in the [[cosmic microwave background radiation|microwave background]] power spectrum to determine the size of the decoupling surface (size of the universe at the time of recombination).  The light travel time to this surface (depending on the geometry used) yields a reliable age for the universe.  Assuming the validity of the models used to determine this age, the residual accuracy yields a margin of error near one percent.&lt;ref name="wmap"&gt;

==Assumption of strong priors==
Calculating the age of the universe is accurate only if the assumptions built into the models being used to estimate it are also accurate. This is referred to as [[strong priors]] and essentially involves stripping the potential errors in other parts of the model to render the accuracy of actual observational data directly into the concluded result.  Although this is not a valid procedure in all contexts (as noted in the accompanying caveat: "based on the fact we have assumed the underlying model we used is correct"{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}&lt;!--no reason to doubt this, but quotation should be cited--&gt;), the age given is thus accurate to the specified error (since this error represents the error in the instrument used to gather the raw data input into the model).

The age of the universe based on the best fit to [[Planck (spacecraft)#2015 data release|Planck 2015 data]] alone is {{val|13.813|0.038}} billion years (the estimate of {{val|13.799|0.021}} billion years uses Gaussian [[Prior probability|prior]]s based on earlier estimates from other studies to determine the combined uncertainty). This number represents an accurate "direct" measurement of the age of the universe (other methods typically involve [[Hubble's law]] and the age of the oldest stars in globular clusters, etc.). It is possible to use different methods for determining the same parameter (in this case – the age of the universe) and arrive at different answers with no overlap in the "errors". To best avoid the problem, it is common to show two sets of uncertainties; one related to the actual measurement and the other related to the systematic errors of the model being used.

An important component to the analysis of data used to determine the age of the universe (e.g. from [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck]]) therefore is to use a [[Bayesian statistics|Bayesian statistical]] analysis, which normalizes the results based upon the priors (i.e. the model).&lt;ref name="wmap" /&gt; This quantifies any uncertainty in the accuracy of a measurement due to a particular model used.&lt;ref&gt;

==History==
{{Nature timeline}}

{{main|Cosmic age problem|Cosmic microwave background}}
In the 18th century, the concept that the [[age of the Earth]] was millions, if not billions, of years began to appear. However, most scientists throughout the 19th century and into the first decades of the 20th century presumed that the universe itself was [[Steady State theory|Steady State]] and eternal, with maybe stars coming and going but no changes occurring at the largest scale known at the time.

The first scientific theories indicating that the age of the universe might be finite were the studies of [[thermodynamics]], formalized in the mid-19th century. The concept of [[entropy]] dictates that if the universe (or any other closed system) were infinitely old, then everything inside would be at the same temperature, and thus there would be no stars and no life. No scientific explanation for this contradiction was put forth at the time.

In 1915 [[Albert Einstein]] published the theory of [[general relativity]]&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal
 |last=Einstein |first=A.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1917 constructed the first [[cosmological model]] based on his theory. In order to remain consistent with a steady state universe, Einstein added what was later called a [[cosmological constant]] to his equations. However, already in 1922, also using  Einstein's theory, [[Alexander Friedmann]], and independently five years later [[Georges Lemaître]], showed that the universe cannot be static and must be either expanding or contracting. Einstein's model of a static universe was in addition proved unstable by [[Arthur Eddington]].

The first direct observational hint that the universe has a finite age came from the observations of '[[recession velocity|recession velocities]]', mostly by [[Vesto Slipher]], combined with distances to the '[[nebula]]e' ([[galaxy|galaxies]]) by [[Edwin Hubble]] in a  work published in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier in the 20th century, Hubble and others resolved individual stars within certain nebulae, thus determining that they were galaxies, similar to, but external to, our [[Milky Way Galaxy]]. In addition, these galaxies were very large and very far away. [[electromagnetic spectrum|Spectra]] taken of these distant galaxies showed a [[red shift]] in their [[spectral lines]] presumably caused by the [[Doppler effect]], thus indicating that these galaxies were moving away from the Earth. In addition, the farther away these galaxies seemed to be (the dimmer they appeared to us) the greater was their redshift, and thus the faster they seemed to be moving away. This was the first direct evidence that the universe is not static but expanding. The first estimate of the age of the universe came from the calculation of when all of the objects must have started speeding out from the same point. Hubble's initial value for the universe's age was very low, as the galaxies were assumed to be much closer than later observations found them to be.

The first reasonably accurate measurement of the rate of expansion of the universe, a numerical value now known as the [[Hubble constant]], was made in 1958 by astronomer [[Allan Sandage]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal

 |doi=10.1086/146483
}}&lt;/ref&gt; His measured value for the Hubble constant came very close to the value range generally accepted today.

However Sandage, like Einstein, did not believe his own results at the time of discovery. His value for the age of the universe{{Elucidate|date=February 2014|reason=What was his value for the age of the universe?}} was too short to reconcile with the 25-billion-year age estimated at that time for the oldest known [[star]]s. Sandage and other astronomers repeated these measurements numerous times, attempting to reduce the [[Hubble constant]] and thus increase the resulting age for the universe. Sandage even proposed new theories of [[cosmogony]] to explain this discrepancy. This issue was finally resolved by improvements in the theoretical models used for estimating the ages of stars. As of 2013, using the latest models for stellar evolution, the estimated age of the [[oldest star|oldest known star]] is {{val|14.46|0.8}} billion years.&lt;ref name=arxiv&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; finally brought an effective end to the remaining scientific uncertainty over the expanding universe. It was a chance result from work by two teams less than 60 miles apart.  In 1964, [[Arno Allan Penzias|Arno Penzias]] and [[Robert Woodrow Wilson|Robert Wilson]] were trying to detect [[radio wave]] [[echo]]es with a supersensitive antenna. The antenna persistently detected a low, steady, mysterious [[noise (electronics)|noise]] in the [[microwave radiation|microwave region]] that was evenly spread over the sky, and was present day and night. After testing, they became certain that the signal did not come from the [[Earth]], the [[Sun]], or [[Milky Way|our galaxy]], but from outside our own galaxy, but could not explain it. At the same time another team, [[Robert H. Dicke]], [[P. J. E. Peebles|Jim Peebles]], and [[David Todd Wilkinson|David Wilkinson]], were attempting to detect low level noise which might be left over from the [[Big Bang]] and could prove whether the Big Bang theory was correct. The two teams realized that the detected noise was in fact radiation left over from the Big Bang, and that this was strong evidence that the theory was correct. Since then, a great deal of other evidence has strengthened and confirmed this conclusion, and refined the estimated age of the universe to its current figure.

The space probes WMAP, launched in 2001, and [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck]], launched in 2009, produced data that determines the Hubble constant and the age of the universe independent of galaxy distances, removing the largest source of error.&lt;ref name="wmap"/&gt;

Since [[Georges Lemaître]] first noted in 1927 that an expanding universe could be traced back in time to an originating single point, scientists have built on his idea of cosmic expansion.

American astronomer Edwin Hubble observed that the distances to faraway galaxies were strongly correlated with their [[redshift]]s. This was interpreted to mean that all distant galaxies and clusters are receding away from our vantage point with an apparent velocity proportional to their distance: that is, the farther they are, the faster they move away from us, regardless of direction.&lt;ref name="hubble"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assuming the [[Copernican principle]] (that the Earth is not the center of the universe), the only remaining interpretation is that all observable regions of the universe are receding from all others. Since we know that the distance between galaxies increases today, it must mean that in the past galaxies were closer together. The continuous expansion of the universe implies that the universe was denser and hotter in the past.

Large [[particle accelerator]]s can replicate the conditions that prevailed after the early moments of the universe, resulting in confirmation and refinement of the details of the Big Bang model. However, these accelerators can only probe so far into [[high-energy physics|high energy regimes]]. Consequently, the state of the universe in the earliest instants of the Big Bang expansion is still poorly understood and an area of open investigation and speculation.

The first [[subatomic particle]]s to be formed included [[proton]]s, [[neutron]]s, and [[electron]]s. Though simple [[big bang nucleosynthesis|atomic nuclei formed]] within the first three minutes after the Big Bang, thousands of years passed before the first [[Recombination (cosmology)|electrically neutral atoms formed]]. The majority of atoms produced by the Big Bang were [[hydrogen]], along with [[helium]] and traces of [[lithium]]. Giant clouds of these primordial elements later coalesced through [[gravity]] to form [[star]]s and galaxies, and the heavier elements were synthesized either [[Stellar nucleosynthesis|within stars]] or [[supernova nucleosynthesis|during supernovae]].

The Big Bang theory offers a comprehensive explanation for a broad range of observed phenomena, including the abundance of light elements, the [[cosmic microwave background|CMB]], [[Large-scale structure of the cosmos|large scale structure]], and [[Hubble's Law]].&lt;ref name=Wright2009&gt;

The governing equations were formulated by [[Alexander Friedmann]], and similar solutions were worked on by [[Willem de Sitter]]. Since then, astrophysicists have incorporated observational and theoretical additions into the Big Bang model, and its [[parametrization]] as the [[Lambda-CDM model]] serves as the framework for current investigations of theoretical cosmology. The Lambda-CDM model is the current "standard model" of Big Bang cosmology, [[Scientific consensus|consensus]] is that it is the simplest model that can account for the various measurements and [[Observational cosmology|observations relevant to cosmology]].

In either case, "the Big Bang" as an event is also colloquially referred to as the "birth" of our universe since it represents the point in history where the universe can be verified to have entered into a [[Equation of state (cosmology)|regime]] where the laws of physics as we understand them (specifically general relativity and the [[Standard Model|standard model of particle physics]]) work. Based on measurements of the expansion using [[Type Ia supernova]]e and measurements of temperature fluctuations in the [[cosmic microwave background]], the time that has passed since that event — otherwise known as the "[[age of the universe]]" — is 13.799 ± 0.021&amp;nbsp;billion years.&lt;ref name="Planck 2015"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Planck Collaboration |title=Planck 2015 results.

Despite being extremely [[density|dense]] at this time—far denser than is usually required to form a [[black hole]]—the universe did not re-collapse into a black hole. This may be explained by considering that commonly-used calculations and limits for [[gravitational collapse]] are usually based upon objects of relatively constant size, such as [[star]]s, and do not apply to [[metric expansion of space|rapidly expanding space]] such as the Big Bang.

The earliest phases of the Big Bang are subject to much speculation. In the most common models the universe was filled [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|homogeneously]] and [[isotropic]]ally with a very high [[energy density]] and huge temperatures and [[pressure]]s and was very rapidly expanding and cooling. Approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;−37&lt;/sup&gt; seconds into the expansion, a [[phase transition]] caused a [[cosmic inflation]], during which the universe grew [[exponential growth|exponentially]] during which time [[Quantum fluctuation|density fluctuations]] that occurred because of the [[uncertainty principle]] were amplified into the seeds that would later form the [[Structure formation|large-scale structure]] of the universe.&lt;ref name="guth"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Temperatures were so high that the random motions of particles were at [[Special relativity|relativistic]] [[Relativistic speed|speeds]], and [[Antimatter|particle–antiparticle pairs]] of all kinds were being continuously created and destroyed in collisions.&lt;ref name=HTUW/&gt; At some point, an unknown reaction called [[baryogenesis]] violated the conservation of [[baryon number]], leading to a very small excess of [[quark]]s and [[lepton]]s over antiquarks and antileptons—of the order of one part in 30&amp;nbsp;million. This resulted in the predominance of [[matter]] over [[antimatter]] in the present universe.&lt;ref name="kolb_c6"&gt;Kolb and Turner (1988), chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt;

The universe continued to decrease in density and fall in temperature, hence the typical energy of each particle was decreasing. [[Explicit symmetry breaking|Symmetry breaking]] phase transitions put the [[fundamental force]]s of physics and the parameters of [[elementary particles]] into their present form.&lt;ref name="kolb_c7"&gt;Kolb and Turner (1988), chapter 7&lt;/ref&gt; After about 10&lt;sup&gt;−11&lt;/sup&gt; seconds, the picture becomes less speculative, since particle energies drop to values that can be attained in [[particle accelerator]]s. At about 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; seconds, quarks and gluons combined to form [[baryon]]s such as protons and neutrons. The small excess of quarks over antiquarks led to a small excess of baryons over antibaryons. The temperature was now no longer high enough to create new proton–antiproton pairs (similarly for neutrons–antineutrons), so a mass annihilation immediately followed, leaving just one in 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; of the original protons and neutrons, and none of their antiparticles. A similar process happened at about 1 second for electrons and positrons. After these annihilations, the remaining protons, neutrons and electrons were no longer moving relativistically and the energy density of the universe was dominated by [[photon]]s (with a minor contribution from [[neutrino]]s).

A few minutes into the expansion, when the temperature was about a billion (one thousand million) [[kelvin]] and the density was about that of air, neutrons combined with protons to form the universe's [[deuterium]] and helium [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] in a process called [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]].&lt;ref name="kolb_c4"/&gt; Most protons remained uncombined as hydrogen nuclei.&lt;ref name="peacock_c9"/&gt;

As the universe cooled, the [[rest mass]] energy density of matter came to gravitationally dominate that of the photon [[electromagnetic radiation|radiation]]. After about 379,000 years, the electrons and nuclei combined into atoms (mostly hydrogen); hence the radiation decoupled from matter and continued through space largely unimpeded. This relic radiation is known as the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]].&lt;ref name="peacock_c9"&gt;Peacock (1999), chapter 9&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Biochemistry|chemistry of life]] may have begun shortly after the Big Bang, [[Age of the universe|13.8 billion years ago]], during a habitable epoch when the universe was only 10–17 million years old.&lt;ref name="Loeb_2014"&gt;{{cite web |last=Loeb |first=Abraham |authorlink=Abraham Loeb |title=The Habitable Epoch of the Early Universe |format=PDF |publisher=Cambridge University Press / Astronomy Department, Harvard University |date=24 September 2014 |url=https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~loeb/habitable.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IJA-2014October"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Loeb |first=Abraham |authorlink=Abraham Loeb |title=The Habitable Epoch of the Early Universe |date=October 2014 |journal=[[International Journal of Astrobiology]] |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=337–339 |doi=10.1017/S1473550414000196 |arxiv=1312.0613 |bibcode=2014IJAsB..13..337L|citeseerx=10.1.1.748.4820 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20141202"&gt;{{cite news |last=Dreifus |first=Claudia |authorlink=Claudia Dreifus |title=Much-Discussed Views That Go Way Back - Avi Loeb Ponders the Early Universe, Nature and Life |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/02/science/avi-loeb-ponders-the-early-universe-nature-and-life.html |date=2 December 2014 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cosmic acceleration ===
{{Main|Accelerating expansion of the universe}}
Independent lines of evidence from Type Ia supernovae and the [[Cosmic microwave background radiation|CMB]] imply that the universe today is dominated by a mysterious form of energy known as [[dark energy]], which apparently permeates all of space. The observations suggest 73% of the total energy density of today's universe is in this form. When the universe was very young, it was likely infused with dark energy, but with less space and everything closer together, gravity predominated, and it was slowly braking the expansion. But eventually, after numerous billion years of expansion, the growing abundance of dark energy caused the [[Hubble's law|expansion of the universe]] to slowly begin to accelerate.&lt;ref name="peebles" /&gt;

Dark energy in its simplest formulation takes the form of the [[cosmological constant]] term in [[Einstein's field equation]]s of general relativity, but its composition and mechanism are unknown and, more generally, the details of its [[equation of state (cosmology)|equation of state]] and relationship with the [[Standard Model]] of particle physics continue to be investigated both through observation and theoretically.&lt;ref name="peebles" /&gt;

All of this cosmic evolution after the [[inflationary epoch]] can be rigorously described and modeled by the ΛCDM model of cosmology, which uses the independent frameworks of quantum mechanics and Einstein's General Relativity. There is no well-supported model describing the action prior to 10&lt;sup&gt;−15&lt;/sup&gt; seconds or so. Apparently a new unified theory of [[quantum gravity|quantum gravitation]] is needed to break this barrier. Understanding this earliest of eras in the history of the universe is currently one of the greatest [[unsolved problems in physics]].

== Features of the model ==
The Big Bang theory depends on two major assumptions: the universality of [[physical law]]s and the [[cosmological principle]]. The cosmological principle states that on large scales the universe is [[Homogeneous space|homogeneous]] and [[isotropy|isotropic]].

These ideas were initially taken as postulates, but today there are efforts to test each of them. For example, the first assumption has been tested by observations showing that largest possible deviation of the [[fine structure constant]] over much of the [[age of the universe]] is of order 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;

If the large-scale universe appears isotropic as viewed from Earth, the cosmological principle can be derived from the simpler [[Copernican principle]], which states that there is no preferred (or special) observer or vantage point. To this end, the cosmological principle has been confirmed to a level of 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; via observations of the CMB. The universe has been measured to be homogeneous on the largest scales at the 10% level.&lt;ref&gt;

===Expansion of space===
{{Main|Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric|Metric expansion of space}}
General relativity describes spacetime by a [[metric tensor|metric]], which determines the distances that separate nearby points. The points, which can be galaxies, stars, or other objects, are themselves specified using a [[coordinate chart]] or "grid" that is laid down over all [[spacetime]]. The cosmological principle implies that the metric should be [[Homogeneous space|homogeneous]] and [[isotropic]] on large scales, which uniquely singles out the [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric]] (FLRW metric). 
This metric contains a [[scale factor]], which describes how the size of the universe changes with time. This enables a convenient choice of a [[coordinate system]] to be made, called [[comoving coordinates]]. In this coordinate system, the grid expands along with the universe, and objects that are moving only because of the expansion of the universe, remain at fixed points on the grid. While their ''coordinate'' distance ([[comoving distance]]) remains constant, the ''physical'' distance between two such co-moving points expands proportionally with the [[scale factor]] of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;

The Big Bang is not an explosion of matter moving outward to fill an empty universe. Instead, [[metric expansion of space|space itself expands]] with time everywhere and increases the physical distance between two comoving points. In other words, the Big Bang is not an explosion ''in space'', but rather an expansion ''of space''.&lt;ref name="HTUW"/&gt; Because the FLRW metric assumes a uniform distribution of mass and energy, it applies to our universe only on large scales—local concentrations of matter such as our galaxy are gravitationally bound and as such do not experience the large-scale expansion of space.&lt;ref&gt;Tamara M. Davis and Charles H. Lineweaver, ''Expanding Confusion: common misconceptions of cosmological horizons and the superluminal expansion of the Universe''. [https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0310808 astro-ph/0310808]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Horizons===
{{Main|List of cosmological horizons}}
An important feature of the Big Bang spacetime is the presence of [[particle horizon]]s. Since the universe has a finite age, and light travels at a finite speed, there may be events in the past whose light has not had time to reach us. This places a limit or a ''past horizon'' on the most distant objects that can be observed. Conversely, because space is expanding, and more distant objects are receding ever more quickly, light emitted by us today may never "catch up" to very distant objects. This defines a ''future horizon'', which limits the events in the future that we will be able to influence. The presence of either type of horizon depends on the details of the [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric|FLRW]] model that describes our universe.&lt;ref name="kolb_c3"/&gt;

Our understanding of the universe back to very early times [[Big Bang#Horizon problem|suggests]] that there is a past horizon, though in practice our view is also limited by the opacity of the universe at early times. So our view cannot extend further backward in time, though the horizon recedes in space. If the expansion of the universe continues to [[accelerating universe|accelerate]], there is a future horizon as well.&lt;ref name="kolb_c3"&gt;Kolb and Turner (1988), chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Etymology===
English astronomer [[Fred Hoyle]] is credited with coining the term "Big Bang" during a 1949 BBC radio broadcast, saying: "These theories were based on the hypothesis that all the matter in the universe was created in one big bang at a particular time in the remote past."&lt;ref&gt;

It is popularly reported that Hoyle, who favored an alternative "[[steady state universe|steady state]]" cosmological model, intended this to be pejorative,&lt;ref&gt;

The Big Bang theory developed from observations of the structure of the universe and from theoretical considerations. In 1912 [[Vesto Slipher]] measured the first [[Doppler shift]] of a "[[spiral nebula]]" (spiral nebula is the obsolete term for spiral galaxies), and soon discovered that almost all such nebulae were receding from Earth. He did not grasp the cosmological implications of this fact, and indeed at the time it was [[Shapley–Curtis debate|highly controversial]] whether or not these nebulae were "island universes" outside our [[Milky Way]].&lt;ref&gt;

}})&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1931 Lemaître went further and suggested that the evident expansion of the universe, if projected back in time, meant that the further in the past the smaller the universe was, until at some finite time in the past all the mass of the universe was concentrated into a single point, a "primeval atom" where and when the fabric of time and space came into existence.&lt;ref&gt;

Starting in 1924, Hubble painstakingly developed a series of distance indicators, the forerunner of the [[cosmic distance ladder]], using the {{convert|100|in|m|adj=on}} [[Hooker telescope]] at [[Mount Wilson Observatory]]. This allowed him to estimate distances to galaxies whose redshifts had already been measured, mostly by Slipher. In 1929 Hubble discovered a correlation between distance and recession velocity—now known as [[Hubble's law]].&lt;ref name="hubble"/&gt;&lt;ref name="christianson"&gt;

In the 1920s and 1930s almost every major cosmologist preferred an eternal [[Steady state theory|steady state]] universe, and several complained that the beginning of time implied by the Big Bang imported religious concepts into physics; this objection was later repeated by supporters of the steady state theory.&lt;ref&gt;

In the mid-1990s, observations of certain [[globular cluster]]s appeared to indicate that they were about 15&amp;nbsp;billion years old, which [[cosmic age problem|conflicted]] with most then-current estimates of the age of the universe (and indeed with the age measured today).

===Hubble's law and the expansion of space===
{{Main|Hubble's law|Metric expansion of space}}
{{See also|Distance measures (cosmology)|Scale factor (universe)}}
Observations of distant galaxies and [[quasar]]s show that these objects are redshifted—the [[light]] emitted from them has been shifted to longer wavelengths. This can be seen by taking a [[frequency spectrum]] of an object and matching the [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] pattern of [[emission line]]s or [[absorption line]]s corresponding to [[atom]]s of the [[chemical element]]s interacting with the light. These redshifts are [[Homogeneity (physics)|uniformly]] isotropic, distributed evenly among the observed objects in all directions. If the redshift is interpreted as a Doppler shift, the recessional [[velocity]] of the object can be calculated. For some galaxies, it is possible to estimate distances via the [[cosmic distance ladder]]. When the recessional velocities are plotted against these distances, a linear relationship known as Hubble's law is observed:&lt;ref name="hubble" /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;v = H_0D&lt;/math&gt;
where
* &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the recessional [[velocity]] of the [[galaxy]] or other distant object,
* &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the [[comoving distance]] to the object, and
* &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt; is [[Hubble's constant]], measured to be {{val|70.4|+1.3|-1.4}} [[kilometres|km]]/[[second|s]]/[[Megaparsec|Mpc]] by the [[WMAP]] probe.&lt;ref name="wmap7year" /&gt;

[[Hubble's law]] has two possible explanations. Either we are at the center of an explosion of galaxies—which is untenable given the [[Copernican principle]]—or the universe is [[Metric expansion of space|uniformly expanding]] everywhere. This universal expansion was predicted from general relativity by Alexander Friedmann in 1922&lt;ref name=af1922 /&gt; and Georges Lemaître in 1927,&lt;ref name=gl1927 /&gt; well before Hubble made his 1929 analysis and observations, and it remains the cornerstone of the Big Bang theory as developed by [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric|Friedmann, Lemaître, Robertson, and Walker]].

The theory requires the relation &lt;math&gt;v = HD&lt;/math&gt; to hold at all times, where &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the [[comoving distance]], ''v'' is the [[recessional velocity]], and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; vary as the universe expands (hence we write &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt; to denote the present-day Hubble "constant"). For distances much smaller than the size of the [[observable universe]], the Hubble redshift can be thought of as the Doppler shift corresponding to the recession velocity &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;. However, the redshift is not a true Doppler shift, but rather the result of the expansion of the universe between the time the light was emitted and the time that it was detected.&lt;ref name="peacock_c3"&gt;Peacock (1999), chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt;

That [[Metric expansion of space|space is undergoing metric expansion]] is shown by direct observational evidence of the [[Cosmological principle]] and the Copernican principle, which together with Hubble's law have no other explanation. Astronomical redshifts are extremely [[isotropic]] and [[Homogeneity (physics)#Translation invariance|homogeneous]],&lt;ref name="hubble" /&gt; supporting the Cosmological principle that the universe looks the same in all directions, along with much other evidence. If the redshifts were the result of an explosion from a center distant from us, they would not be so similar in different directions.

Measurements of the effects of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] on the dynamics of distant astrophysical systems in 2000 proved the Copernican principle, that, on a cosmological scale, the Earth is not in a central position.&lt;ref&gt;

Uniform cooling of the CMB over billions of years is explainable only if the universe is experiencing a metric expansion, and excludes the possibility that we are near the unique center of an explosion.

In 1964 [[Arno Penzias]] and [[Robert Woodrow Wilson|Robert Wilson]] serendipitously discovered the cosmic background radiation, an omnidirectional signal in the [[microwave]] band.&lt;ref name="penzias" /&gt; Their discovery provided substantial confirmation of the big-bang predictions by Alpher, Herman and Gamow around 1950. Through the 1970s the radiation was found to be approximately consistent with a black body spectrum in all directions; this spectrum has been redshifted by the expansion of the universe, and today corresponds to approximately 2.725&amp;nbsp;K. This tipped the balance of evidence in favor of the Big Bang model, and Penzias and Wilson were awarded a [[Nobel Prize]] in 1978.

The ''surface of last scattering'' corresponding to emission of the CMB occurs shortly after ''[[Recombination (cosmology)|recombination]]'', the epoch when neutral hydrogen becomes stable. Prior to this, the universe comprised a hot dense photon-baryon plasma sea where photons were quickly [[Thomson scattering|scattered]] from free charged particles.

In 1989, [[NASA]] launched the [[Cosmic Background Explorer satellite]] (COBE), which made two major advances: in 1990, high-precision spectrum measurements showed that the &lt;abbr title="cosmic microwave background raditation"&gt;CMB&lt;/abbr&gt; frequency spectrum is an almost perfect [[blackbody]] with no deviations at a level of 1 part in 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, and measured a residual temperature of 2.726&amp;nbsp;K (more recent measurements have revised this figure down slightly to 2.7255&amp;nbsp;K); then in 1992, further COBE measurements discovered tiny fluctuations (anisotropies) in the CMB temperature across the sky, at a level of about one part in 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="cobe" /&gt; [[John C. Mather]] and [[George Smoot]] were awarded the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physics for their leadership in these results.

During the following decade, CMB anisotropies were further investigated by a large number of ground-based and balloon experiments. In 2000–2001 several experiments, most notably [[BOOMERanG experiment|BOOMERanG]], found the [[shape of the universe]] to be spatially almost flat by measuring the typical angular size (the size on the sky) of the anisotropies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Melchiorri |first=A., et. al. |title=A measurement of Omega from the North American test flight of BOOMERANG |volume=536 |issue=2 |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |year=1999 |arxiv=astro-ph/9911445|doi=10.1086/312744 |pmid=10859119 |bibcode=2000ApJ...536L..63M |pages=L63–L66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=de Bernardis |first=P. |display-authors=etal |title=A Flat Universe from High-Resolution Maps of the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation |pages=955–959 |journal=Nature |volume=404 |issue=6781 |year=2000 |arxiv=

In early 2003, the first results of the [[WMAP|Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe]] (WMAP) were released, yielding what were at the time the most accurate values for some of the cosmological parameters.

This value can be calculated independently from the detailed structure of [[cosmic microwave background radiation|CMB]] fluctuations. The ratios predicted (by mass, not by number) are about 0.25 for &lt;chem&gt;^4He/H&lt;/chem&gt;, about 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; for &lt;chem&gt;^2H/H&lt;/chem&gt;, about 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; for &lt;chem&gt;^3He/H&lt;/chem&gt; and about 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; for &lt;chem&gt;^7Li/H&lt;/chem&gt;.&lt;ref name="kolb_c4"&gt;Kolb and Turner (1988), chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt;

The measured abundances all agree at least roughly with those predicted from a single value of the baryon-to-photon ratio. The agreement is excellent for deuterium, close but formally discrepant for &lt;chem&gt;^4He&lt;/chem&gt;, and off by a factor of two for &lt;chem&gt;^7Li&lt;/chem&gt;; in the latter two cases there are substantial [[systematic error|systematic uncertainties]]. Nonetheless, the general consistency with abundances predicted by Big Bang nucleosynthesis is strong evidence for the Big Bang, as the theory is the only known explanation for the relative abundances of light elements, and it is virtually impossible to "tune" the Big Bang to produce much more or less than 20–30% helium.&lt;ref&gt;

===Galactic evolution and distribution===
{{Main|Galaxy formation and evolution|Structure formation}}
Detailed observations of the [[Galaxy morphological classification|morphology]] and [[Large-scale structure of the cosmos|distribution]] of galaxies and [[quasars]] are in agreement with the current state of the Big Bang theory. A combination of observations and theory suggest that the first quasars and galaxies formed about a billion years after the Big Bang, and since then, larger structures have been forming, such as [[galaxy clusters]] and [[supercluster]]s.&lt;ref name="Bertschinger"/&gt;

Populations of stars have been aging and evolving, so that distant galaxies (which are observed as they were in the early universe) appear very different from nearby galaxies (observed in a more recent state). Moreover, galaxies that formed relatively recently, appear markedly different from galaxies formed at similar distances but shortly after the Big Bang. These observations are strong arguments against the steady-state model. Observations of [[star formation]], galaxy and quasar distributions and larger structures, agree well with Big Bang simulations of the formation of structure in the universe, and are helping to complete details of the theory.&lt;ref name="Bertschinger"&gt;

In 2011, astronomers found what they believe to be pristine clouds of primordial gas by analyzing absorption lines in the spectra of distant quasars. Before this discovery, all other astronomical objects have been observed to contain heavy elements that are formed in stars. These two clouds of gas contain no elements heavier than hydrogen and deuterium.&lt;ref&gt;

The age of the universe as estimated from the Hubble expansion and the [[cosmic microwave background radiation|CMB]] is now in good agreement with other estimates using the ages of the oldest stars, both as measured by applying the theory of [[stellar evolution]] to [[globular clusters]] and through [[radiometric dating]] of individual [[Population II]] stars.&lt;ref&gt;

=={{anchor|Problems}}Problems and related issues in physics==
{{See also|List of unsolved problems in physics}}
As with any theory, a number of mysteries and problems have arisen as a result of the development of the Big Bang theory. Some of these mysteries and problems have been resolved while others are still outstanding. Proposed solutions to some of the problems in the Big Bang model have revealed new mysteries of their own. For example, the [[horizon problem]], the [[magnetic monopole problem]], and the [[flatness problem]] are most commonly resolved with [[Cosmic inflation|inflationary theory]], but the details of the inflationary universe are still left unresolved and many, including some founders of the theory, say it has been disproven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Earman |first1=John |last2=Mosterín |first2=Jesús |date=March 1999 |title=A Critical Look at Inflationary Cosmology |journal=Philosophy of Science |volume=66 |issue=1 |pages=1–49 |doi=10.1086/392675 |jstor=188736}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

===Baryon asymmetry===
{{Main|Baryon asymmetry}}
It is not yet understood why the universe has more matter than antimatter.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Kolb and Turner, chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally assumed that when the universe was young and very hot it was in statistical equilibrium and contained equal numbers of baryons and antibaryons. However, observations suggest that the universe, including its most distant parts, is made almost entirely of matter. A process called baryogenesis was hypothesized to account for the asymmetry. For baryogenesis to occur, the [[Sakharov conditions]] must be satisfied. These require that baryon number is not conserved, that [[C-symmetry]] and [[CP-symmetry]] are violated and that the universe depart from [[thermodynamic equilibrium]].&lt;ref name="sakharov"&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;(Translated in ''[[Journal of Experimental and Theoretical Physics Letters]]'' '''5''', 24 (1967).)
&lt;/ref&gt; All these conditions occur in the [[Standard Model]], but the effects are not strong enough to explain the present baryon asymmetry.

===Dark energy===
{{Main|Dark energy}}
Measurements of the [[redshift]]–[[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] relation for [[type Ia supernova]]e indicate that the expansion of the universe has been [[accelerating universe|accelerating]] since the universe was about half its present age. To explain this acceleration, general relativity requires that much of the energy in the universe consists of a component with large [[equation of state (cosmology)|negative pressure]], dubbed "dark energy".&lt;ref name="peebles" /&gt;

Dark energy, though speculative, solves numerous problems. Measurements of the [[cosmic microwave background]] indicate that the universe is very nearly spatially flat, and therefore according to general relativity the universe must have almost exactly the [[Critical density (cosmology)|critical density]] of mass/energy. But the mass density of the universe can be measured from its gravitational clustering, and is found to have only about 30% of the critical density.&lt;ref name="peebles" /&gt; Since theory suggests that dark energy does not cluster in the usual way it is the best explanation for the "missing" energy density. Dark energy also helps to explain two geometrical measures of the overall curvature of the universe, one using the frequency of [[gravitational lens]]es, and the other using the characteristic pattern of the [[large-scale structure of the universe|large-scale structure]] as a cosmic ruler.

Negative pressure is believed to be a property of [[vacuum energy]], but the exact nature and existence of dark energy remains one of the great mysteries of the Big Bang. Results from the WMAP team in 2008 are in accordance with a universe that consists of 73% dark energy, 23% dark matter, 4.6% regular matter and less than 1% neutrinos.&lt;ref name="wmap7year" /&gt; According to theory, the energy density in matter decreases with the expansion of the universe, but the dark energy density remains constant (or nearly so) as the universe expands. Therefore, matter made up a larger fraction of the total energy of the universe in the past than it does today, but its fractional contribution will fall in the [[far future]] as dark energy becomes even more dominant.

The dark energy component of the universe has been explained by theorists using a variety of competing theories including Einstein's [[cosmological constant]] but also extending to more exotic forms of [[Quintessence (physics)|quintessence]] or other modified gravity schemes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mortonson |first1=Michael J. |last2=Weinberg |first2=David H.|last3=White |first3=Martin |title=Dark Energy: A Short Review |journal=Particle Data Group 2014 Review of Particle Physics |date=December 2013 |arxiv=1401.0046|bibcode = 2014arXiv1401.0046M }}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mortonson |first1=Michael J. |last2=Weinberg |first2=David H.|last3=White |first3=Martin |title=Dark Energy: A Short Review |work=LEVEL 5 — A Knowledgebase for Extragalactic Astronomy and Cosmology, NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED) |publisher=Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology |date=2014-06-27 |url=https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/March14/Mortonson/Mortonson_contents.html |accessdate=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[cosmological constant problem]], sometimes called the "most embarrassing problem in physics", results from the apparent discrepancy between the measured energy density of dark energy, and the one naively predicted from [[Planck units]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rugh |first1=S.&amp;thinsp;E. |last2=Zinkernagel |first2=H. |title=The quantum vacuum and the cosmological constant problem |pages=663–705 |volume=33 |issue=4 |date=December 2002 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1355219802000333 |journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part B |doi=10.1016/S1355-2198(02)00033-3 |arxiv=hep-th/0012253|bibcode = 2002SHPMP..33..663R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dark matter===
{{Main|Dark matter}}
[[File:Cosmological Composition – Pie Chart.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|[[pie chart|Chart]] shows the proportion of different components of the universe {{spaced ndash}} about 95% is [[dark matter]] and [[dark energy]].]]
During the 1970s and the 1980s, various observations showed that there is not sufficient visible matter in the universe to account for the apparent strength of gravitational forces within and between galaxies. This led to the idea that up to 90% of the matter in the universe is dark matter that does not emit light or interact with normal [[baryon]]ic matter. In addition, the assumption that the universe is mostly normal matter led to predictions that were strongly inconsistent with observations. In particular, the universe today is far more lumpy and contains far less deuterium than can be accounted for without dark matter. While dark matter has always been controversial, it is inferred by various observations: the anisotropies in the CMB, [[galaxy cluster]] velocity dispersions, large-scale structure distributions, [[gravitational lensing]] studies, and [[X-ray astronomy|X-ray measurements]] of galaxy clusters.&lt;ref&gt;

Indirect evidence for dark matter comes from its gravitational influence on other matter, as no dark matter particles have been observed in laboratories. Many [[particle physics]] candidates for dark matter have been proposed, and several projects to detect them directly are underway.&lt;ref name="pdg"&gt;

Additionally, there are outstanding problems associated with the currently favored [[cold dark matter]] model which include the [[dwarf galaxy problem]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bullock |first1=James |title=Notes on the Missing Satellites Problem |journal=XX Canary Islands Winter School of Astrophysics on Local Group Cosmology |arxiv=1009.4505|bibcode = 2010arXiv1009.4505B |year=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[cuspy halo problem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Diemand |first1=Jürg |last2=Zemp |first2=Marcel |last3=Moore |first3=Ben |last4=Stadel |first4=Joachim |last5=Carollo |first5=C.

===Horizon problem===
The [[horizon problem]] results from the premise that information cannot travel [[faster than light]]. In a universe of finite age this sets a limit—the [[particle horizon]]—on the separation of any two regions of space that are in [[causality (physics)|causal]] contact.&lt;ref name="kolb_c8"&gt;Kolb and Turner (1988), chapter 8&lt;/ref&gt; The observed isotropy of the [[Cosmic microwave background|CMB]] is problematic in this regard: if the universe had been dominated by radiation or matter at all times up to the epoch of last scattering, the particle horizon at that time would correspond to about 2 degrees on the sky. There would then be no mechanism to cause wider regions to have the same temperature.&lt;ref name="Ryden2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Barbara Sue Ryden|title=Introduction to cosmology|year=2003|publisher=Addison-Wesley|isbn=978-0-8053-8912-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|191–202}}

A resolution to this apparent inconsistency is offered by [[inflationary theory]] in which a homogeneous and isotropic scalar energy field dominates the universe at some very early period (before baryogenesis). During inflation, the universe undergoes exponential expansion, and the particle horizon expands much more rapidly than previously assumed, so that regions presently on opposite sides of the observable universe are well inside each other's particle horizon. The observed isotropy of the CMB then follows from the fact that this larger region was in causal contact before the beginning of inflation.&lt;ref name="guth"/&gt;{{rp|180–186}}

[[Heisenberg's uncertainty principle]] predicts that during the inflationary phase there would be [[primordial fluctuations|quantum thermal fluctuations]], which would be magnified to cosmic scale. These fluctuations serve as the seeds of all current structure in the universe.&lt;ref name="Ryden2003"/&gt;{{rp|207}} Inflation predicts that the [[primordial fluctuations]] are nearly [[Scale invariance|scale invariant]] and [[Normal distribution|Gaussian]], which has been accurately confirmed by measurements of the CMB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Spergel |first=D. N. |display-authors=etal |title=Three-Year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) Observations: Implications for Cosmology |pages=377–408 |format=PDF |journal=The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series |volume=170 |issue=2 |year=2007 |url=

If inflation occurred, exponential expansion would push large regions of space well beyond our observable horizon.&lt;ref name="guth"/&gt;{{rp|180–186}}

A related issue to the classic horizon problem arises because in most standard cosmological inflation models, inflation ceases well before [[electroweak symmetry breaking]] occurs, so inflation should not be able to prevent large-scale discontinuities in the [[electroweak vacuum]] since distant parts of the observable universe were causally separate when the [[electroweak epoch]] ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=R. Penrose|title=The Road to Reality|publisher=Vintage books|year=2007|isbn=978-0-679-77631-4|title-link=The Road to Reality}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magnetic monopoles===
The [[magnetic monopole]] objection was raised in the late 1970s. [[Grand unified theory|Grand unified theories]] predicted [[topological defect]]s in space that would manifest as [[magnetic monopole]]s. These objects would be produced efficiently in the hot early universe, resulting in a density much higher than is consistent with observations, given that no monopoles have been found. This problem is also resolved by [[cosmic inflation]], which removes all point defects from the observable universe, in the same way that it drives the geometry to flatness.&lt;ref name="kolb_c8"/&gt;

===Flatness problem===
[[File:End of universe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|The overall [[Shape of the universe|geometry of the universe]] is determined by whether the [[Density parameter|Omega cosmological parameter]] is less than, equal to or greater than 1. Shown from top to bottom are a [[Shape of the universe#Spherical universe|closed universe]] with positive curvature, a [[Shape of the universe#Hyperbolic universe|hyperbolic universe]] with negative curvature and a [[flat universe]] with zero curvature.]]

The [[flatness problem]] (also known as the oldness problem) is an observational problem associated with a [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric]] (FLRW).&lt;ref name="kolb_c8"/&gt; The universe may have positive, negative, or zero spatial [[curvature]] depending on its total energy density. Curvature is negative if its density is less than the [[Critical density (cosmology)|critical density]]; positive if greater; and zero at the critical density, in which case space is said to be ''flat''.

The problem is that any small departure from the critical density grows with time, and yet the universe today remains very close to flat.&lt;ref group="notes"&gt;Strictly, dark energy in the form of a cosmological constant drives the universe towards a flat state; however, our universe remained close to flat for several billion years before the dark energy density became significant.&lt;/ref&gt; Given that a natural timescale for departure from flatness might be the [[Planck time]], 10&lt;sup&gt;−43&lt;/sup&gt; seconds,&lt;ref name=HTUW/&gt; the fact that the universe has reached neither a [[heat death of the universe|heat death]] nor a [[Big Crunch]] after billions of years requires an explanation. For instance, even at the relatively late age of a few minutes (the time of nucleosynthesis), the density of the universe must have been within one part in 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; of its critical value, or it would not exist as it does today.&lt;ref&gt;

== Cause ==
{{Main|Problem of why there is anything at all}}
Physics may conclude that [[time]] did not exist before 'Big Bang', but 'started' with the &lt;!--beginning point--&gt;Big Bang and hence there might be no 'beginning', 'before' or potentially 'cause' and instead always existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=No Big Bang? Quantum equation predicts universe has no beginning|url=https://phys.org/news/2015-02-big-quantum-equation-universe.html|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Beginning of TIme|url=http://www.hawking.org.uk/the-beginning-of-time.html|website=Stephen Hawking|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Quantum fluctuation]]s, or other laws of physics that may have existed at the start of the Big Bang could then create the conditions for matter to occur.

== Ultimate fate of the universe ==
{{Main|Ultimate fate of the universe}}

Before observations of dark energy, cosmologists considered two scenarios for the future of the universe. If the mass [[density]] of the universe were greater than the [[Critical density (cosmology)|critical density]], then the universe would reach a maximum size and then begin to collapse. It would become denser and hotter again, ending with a state similar to that in which it started—a Big Crunch.&lt;ref name="kolb_c3"/&gt;

Alternatively, if the density in the universe were equal to or below the critical density, the expansion would slow down but never stop. Star formation would cease with the consumption of interstellar gas in each galaxy; stars would burn out, leaving [[white dwarf]]s, [[neutron star]]s, and [[black hole]]s. Very gradually, collisions between these would result in mass accumulating into larger and larger black holes. The average temperature of the universe would asymptotically approach [[absolute zero]]—a [[Big Freeze]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Griswold |first=Britt |title=What is the Ultimate Fate of the Universe? |work=Universe 101 Big Bang Theory |publisher=NASA |date=2012 |url=
http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/uni_fate.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, if the proton were [[proton decay|unstable]], then baryonic matter would disappear, leaving only radiation and black holes. Eventually, black holes would evaporate by emitting [[Hawking radiation]]. The [[entropy]] of the universe would increase to the point where no organized form of energy could be extracted from it, a scenario known as heat death.&lt;ref name=dying&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Adams |first1=Fred C. |last2=Laughlin |first2=Gregory |lastauthoramp=yes |title=A dying Universe: the long-term fate and evolution of astrophysical objects |pages=337–372 |journal=Reviews of Modern Physics |volume=69 |issue=2 |date=1997 |bibcode=1997RvMP...69..337A |doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.69.337| arxiv=astro-ph/9701131}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|sec VI.D}}

Modern observations of accelerating expansion imply that more and more of the currently visible universe will pass beyond our [[event horizon]] and out of contact with us. The eventual result is not known. The ΛCDM model of the universe contains dark energy in the form of a [[cosmological constant]]. This theory suggests that only gravitationally bound systems, such as galaxies, will remain together, and they too will be subject to heat death as the universe expands and cools. Other explanations of dark energy, called [[phantom energy]] theories, suggest that ultimately galaxy clusters, stars, planets, atoms, nuclei, and matter itself will be torn apart by the ever-increasing expansion in a so-called [[Big Rip]].&lt;ref&gt;

== Misconceptions ==
The following is a partial list of misconceptions about the Big Bang model:

''The Big Bang as the origin of the universe:'' One of the common misconceptions about the Big Bang model is the belief that it was the origin of the universe. However, the Big Bang model does not comment about how the universe came into being. Current conception of the Big Bang model assumes the existence of energy, time, and space, and does not comment about their origin or the cause of the dense and high temperature initial state of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/seuforum/faq.htm|title=Brief Answers to Cosmic Questions|website=www.cfa.harvard.edu|access-date=2017-07-19|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160413195349/https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/seuforum/faq.htm|archivedate=13 April 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Big Bang was "small"'': It is misleading to visualize the Big Bang by comparing its size to everyday objects. When the size of the universe at Big Bang is described, it refers to the size of the observable universe, and not the entire universe.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davis|first=Tamara M.|last2=Lineweaver|first2=Charles H.|date=January 2004|title=Expanding Confusion: Common Misconceptions of Cosmological Horizons and the Superluminal Expansion of the Universe|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/publications-of-the-astronomical-society-of-australia/article/expanding-confusion-common-misconceptions-of-cosmological-horizons-and-the-superluminal-expansion-of-the-universe/EFEEEFD8D71E59F86DDA82FDF576EFD3|journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of Australia|volume=21|issue=1|pages=97–109|doi=10.1071/as03040|arxiv = astro-ph/0310808 |bibcode = 2004PASA...21...97D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Hubble's law]] violates the [[Special relativity|special theory of relativity]]'': Hubble's law predicts that galaxies that are beyond [[Hubble's law|Hubble Distance]] recede [[Faster-than-light|faster than the speed of light]]. However, special relativity does not apply beyond motion through space. Hubble's law describes velocity that results from expansion ''of'' space, rather than ''through'' space.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

''[[Doppler effect|Doppler redshift]] vs [[Cosmological redshift|cosmological red-shift]]'': Astronomers&amp;nbsp;often refer to the cosmological red-shift as a normal Doppler shift,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;which is a misconception. Although similar, the cosmological red-shift is not identical to the Doppler redshift. The Doppler redshift is based on special relativity, which does not consider the expansion of space. On the contrary, the cosmological red-shift is based on general relativity, in which the expansion of space is considered. Although they may appear identical for nearby galaxies, it may cause confusion if the behavior of distant galaxies is understood through the Doppler redshift.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Speculations ==
{{Main|Cosmogony}}

While the Big Bang model is well established in cosmology, it is likely to be refined. The Big Bang theory, built upon the equations of classical general relativity, indicates a [[essential singularity|singularity]] at the origin of cosmic time; this [[infinity#Physics|infinite]] [[energy density]] is regarded as impossible in [[experimental physics|physics]].  Still, it is known that the equations are not applicable before the time when the universe cooled down to the [[Planck temperature]], and this conclusion depends on various assumptions, of which some could never be experimentally verified. ''(Also see [[Planck epoch]].)''

One proposed refinement to avoid this would-be singularity is to develop a correct treatment of [[quantum gravity]].&lt;ref&gt;

It is not known what could have preceded the hot dense state of the early universe or how and why it originated, though speculation abounds in the field of [[cosmogony]].

Some proposals, each of which entails untested hypotheses, are:
* Models including the [[Hartle–Hawking state|Hartle–Hawking no-boundary condition]], in which the whole of space-time is finite; the Big Bang does represent the limit of time but without any singularity.&lt;ref&gt;

* Big Bang lattice model, states that the universe at the moment of the Big Bang consists of an infinite lattice of [[fermions]], which is smeared over the [[fundamental domain]] so it has rotational, translational and gauge symmetry. The symmetry is the largest symmetry possible and hence the lowest entropy of any state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

* [[Brane cosmology]] models, in which inflation is due to the movement of branes in [[string theory]]; the pre-Big Bang model; the [[ekpyrotic]] model, in which the Big Bang is the result of a collision between branes; and the [[cyclic model]], a variant of the ekpyrotic model in which collisions occur periodically. In the latter model the Big Bang was preceded by a Big Crunch and the universe cycles from one process to the other.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Colloid vibration current''' is an [[electroacoustic phenomena|electroacoustic phenomenon]] that arises when [[ultrasound]] propagates through a [[fluid]] that contains [[ions]] and either [[solid]] particles or [[emulsion]] droplets.&lt;ref name="Dukhin"&gt;Dukhin, A.S. and Goetz, P.J. [https://books.google.com/books?id=8UwuPmWMbE0C&amp;printsec=frontcover "Ultrasound for characterizing colloids"], Elsevier, 2002 {{ISBN|0-444-51164-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[pressure gradient]] in an ultrasonic wave moves particles relative to the fluid. This motion disturbs the [[double layer (interfacial)|double layer]] that exists at the particle-fluid [[Interface (chemistry)|interface]]. The picture illustrates the mechanism of this distortion. Practically all particles in fluids carry a [[surface charge]]. This surface charge is screened with an equally charged diffuse layer; this structure is called the [[double layer (interfacial)|double layer]]. Ions of the diffuse layer are located in the fluid and can move with the fluid. Fluid motion relative to the particle drags these diffuse ions in the direction of one or the other of the particle's poles. The picture shows ions dragged towards the left hand pole. As a result of this drag, there is an excess of negative ions in the vicinity of the left hand pole and an excess of positive [[surface charge]] at the right hand pole. As a result of this charge excess, particles gain a [[Electric dipole moment|dipole moment]]. These dipole moments generate an electric field that in turn generates measurable electric current.&lt;ref name="Dukhin"/&gt; This phenomenon is widely used for measuring [[zeta potential]] in concentrated [[colloids]].

The '''cosmic age problem''' is a historical problem in astronomy concerning the [[age of the universe]]. The problem was that at various times in the 20th century, some objects in the universe were estimated to be older than the time elapsed since the [[Big Bang]],&lt;ref name=Evidence&gt;[http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/astronomy/bigbang.html#oldstars Evidence for the Big Bang] by Björn Feuerbacher and Ryan Scranton. January 25, 2006. Retrieved 16 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; as estimated from measurements of the expansion rate of the universe known as the [[Hubble constant]], denoted H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. (This is more correctly called the Hubble parameter, since it generally varies with time).
If so, this would represent a contradiction, since objects such as galaxies, stars and planets could not have existed in the extreme temperatures and densities shortly after the Big Bang.

Since around 1997–2003, the problem is believed to be solved by most cosmologists: modern cosmological measurements lead to a precise estimate of the [[age of the universe]] (i.e. time since the Big Bang) of 13.8 billion years, and recent age estimates for the oldest objects are either younger than this, or consistent allowing for measurement uncertainties.

== Early years ==

Following theoretical developments of the [[Friedmann equations]] by [[Alexander Friedmann]] and [[Georges Lemaître]] in the 1920s, and the discovery of the expanding universe by [[Edwin Hubble]] in 1929, it was immediately clear that tracing this expansion backwards in time predicts that the universe had almost zero size at a finite time in the past. This concept, initially known as the "Primeval Atom" by Lemaitre, was later elaborated into the modern [[Big Bang]] theory. If the universe had expanded at a constant rate in the past, the age of the universe now (i.e. the time since the Big Bang) is simply the inverse of the Hubble constant, often known as the ''Hubble time''. For Big Bang models with zero [[cosmological constant]] and positive matter density, the actual age must be somewhat younger than this Hubble time; typically the age would be between 66% and 90% of the Hubble time, depending on the density of matter.

Hubble's early estimate of his constant&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hubble|first1=E.|title=A relation between distance and radial velocity among extra-galactic nebulae|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=15 March 1929|volume=15|issue=3|pages=168–173|doi=10.1073/pnas.15.3.168|pmid=16577160|pmc=522427|bibcode = 1929PNAS...15..168H }}&lt;/ref&gt; was 550&amp;nbsp;(km/s)/Mpc, and the inverse of that is 1.8 billion years. It was believed by many geologists such as [[Arthur Holmes]] in the 1920s that the Earth was probably over 2 billion years old, but with large uncertainty.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} The possible discrepancy between the ages of the Earth and the universe was probably one motivation for the development of the [[Steady State theory]] in 1948 as an alternative to the Big Bang;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kragh|first1=Helge|title=Cosmology and Controversy|date=1999|publisher=Princeton Univ. Press|isbn=978-0691005461}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the (now obsolete) steady state theory, the universe is infinitely old and on average unchanging with time. The steady state theory postulated spontaneous creation of matter to keep the average density constant as the universe expands, and therefore most galaxies still have an age less than 1/H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. However, if H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; had been 550&amp;nbsp;(km/s)/Mpc, our Milky Way galaxy would be exceptionally large compared to most other galaxies, so it could well be much older than an average galaxy, therefore eliminating the age problem.

== 1950–1970 ==

In the 1950s, two substantial errors were discovered in Hubble's extragalactic distance scale: first in 1952, [[Walter Baade]] discovered there were two classes of [[Cepheid]] variable star. Hubble's sample comprised different classes nearby and in other galaxies, and correcting this error made all other galaxies twice as distant as Hubble's values, thus doubling the Hubble time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baade|first1=W.|title=The Period-Luminosity Relation of the Cepheids|journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific|date=February 1956|volume=68|issue=400|pages=5|doi=10.1086/126870|bibcode = 1956PASP...68....5B }}&lt;/ref&gt; A second error was discovered by [[Allan Sandage]] and coworkers: for galaxies beyond the [[Local Group]], Cepheids were too faint to observe with Hubble's instruments, so Hubble used the brightest stars as distance indicators. Many of Hubble's "brightest stars" were actually HII regions or clusters containing many stars, which caused another underestimation of distances for these more distant galaxies.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Thus, in 1958 Sandage&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sandage|first=Allan|title=Current Problems in the Extragalactic Distance Scale|journal=Astrophysical Journal|date=1958|volume=127|page=513|doi=10.1086/146483|bibcode=1958ApJ...127..513S}}&lt;/ref&gt;  published the first reasonably accurate measurement of the Hubble constant, at 75&amp;nbsp;(km/s)/Mpc, which is close to modern estimates of 68–74&amp;nbsp;(km/s)/Mpc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Riess|first=A.|title=A 3% solution: determination of the Hubble constant with the Hubble Space Telescope|journal=Astrophysical Journal|volume=730|issue=119|pages=119|arxiv=1103.2976|last2=Macri|first2=Lucas|last3=Casertano|first3=Stefano|last4=Lampeitl|first4=Hubert|last5= Ferguson|first5=Henry C.|last6= Filippenko|first6=Alexei V.|last7= Jha|first7=Saurabh W.|last8=Li|first8=Weidong|last9=Chornock|first9=Ryan|year=2011|bibcode = 2011ApJ...730..119R |doi = 10.1088/0004-637X/730/2/119 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The age of the Earth (actually the Solar System) was first accurately measured around 1955 by [[Clair Patterson]] at 4.55 billion years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Patterson|first1=C.|last2=Tilton|first2=G.|last3=Inghram|first3=M.|title=Age of the Earth|journal=Science|date=21 January 1955|volume=121|issue=3134|pages=69–75|doi=10.1126/science.121.3134.69|pmid=17782556|bibcode = 1955Sci...121...69P }}&lt;/ref&gt; essentially identical to the modern value. For H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ~ 75&amp;nbsp;(km/s)/Mpc, the inverse of H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is 13.0 billion years; so after 1958 the Big Bang model age was comfortably older than the Earth.

However, in the 1960s and onwards, new developments in the theory of stellar evolution enabled age estimates for large star clusters called [[globular clusters]]: these generally gave age estimates of around 15 billion years, with substantial scatter.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}  Further revisions of the Hubble constant by Sandage and [[Gustav Tammann]] in the 1970s gave values around 50–60&amp;nbsp;(km/s)/Mpc,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sandage|first1=A.|last2=Tammann|first2=G. A.|title=Steps toward the Hubble constant. VII - Distances to NGC 2403, M101, and the Virgo cluster using 21 centimeter line widths compared with optical methods: The global value of H sub 0|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=210|pages=7|doi=10.1086/154798|bibcode=1976ApJ...210....7S|year=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an inverse of 16-20 billion years, consistent with globular cluster ages.

== 1975–1990 ==

However, in the late 1970s to early 1990s, the age problem re-appeared: new estimates of the Hubble constant gave higher values, with [[Gerard de Vaucouleurs]] estimating values 90–100&amp;nbsp;(km/s)/Mpc,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Vaucouleurs|first1=G.|title=Five crucial tests of the cosmic distance scale using the Galaxy as fundamental standard|journal=Nature|date=23 September 1982|volume=299|issue=5881|pages=303–307|doi=10.1038/299303a0|bibcode = 1982Natur.299..303D }}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Marc Aaronson]] and co-workers gave values around 80-90 &amp;nbsp;(km/s)/Mpc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aaronson|first1=M.|last2=Bothun|first2=G.|last3=Mould|first3=J.|last4=Huchra|first4=J.|last5=Schommer|first5=R.

== Late 1990s: probable solution ==

The age problem was eventually thought to be resolved by several developments between 1995-2003: firstly, a large program with the [[Hubble space telescope]] measured the Hubble constant at 72&amp;nbsp;(km/s)/Mpc with 10 percent uncertainty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Madore|first1=Barry F.|last2=Freedman|first2=Wendy  L.|last3=Silbermann|first3=N.|last4=Harding|first4=Paul|last5=Huchra|first5=John|last6=Mould|first6=Jeremy R.|last7=Graham|first7=John A.|last8=Ferrarese|first8=Laura|last9=Gibson|first9=Brad K.|last10=Han|first10=Mingsheng|last11=Hoessel|first11=John G.|last12=Hughes|first12=Shaun M.|last13=Illingworth|first13=Garth D.|last14=Phelps|first14=Randy|last15=Sakai|first15=Shoko|last16=Stetson|first16=Peter|title=The Key Project on the Extragalactic Distance Scale.

The presence of dark energy implies that the universe was expanding more slowly at around half its present age than today, which makes the universe older for a given value of the Hubble constant.  The combination of the three results above essentially removed the discrepancy between estimated globular cluster ages and the age of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Krauss, Lawrence M. |author2=Chaboyer, Brian |title=Age Estimates of Globular Clusters in the Milky Way: Constraints on Cosmology |journal=Science |date=3 January 2003 |volume=299 |issue=5603 |pages=65&amp;ndash;69 |bibcode=2003Sci...299...65K |doi=10.1126/science.1075631 |pmid=12511641}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cosmic latte''' is a name assigned to the average color of the [[universe]], found by a team of [[astronomers]] from [[Johns Hopkins University]]. In 2001, [[Karl Glazebrook]] and Ivan Baldry determined that the average color of the universe was a greenish white, but they soon corrected their analysis in a 2002 paper in which they reported that their survey of the light from over 200,000 [[galaxy|galaxies]] averaged to a slightly [[beige]]ish [[white]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baldry|first=Ivan K.|last2=Glazebrook|first2=Karl|last3=Baugh|first3=Carlton M.|last4=Bland‐hawthorn|first4=Joss|last5=Bridges|first5=Terry|last6=Cannon|first6=Russell|last7=Cole|first7=Shaun|last8=Colless|first8=Matthew|last9=Collins|first9=Chris|year=2002|title=The 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey: Constraints on Cosmic Star Formation History from the Cosmic Spectrum|publisher=The American Astronomical Society|publication-date=20 April 2002|volume=569|issue=2|pages=582–594|doi=10.1086/339477|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;|periodical=The Astrophysical Journal|arxiv=astro-ph/0110676|bibcode=2002ApJ...569..582B}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hex Triplet|hex triplet]] value for cosmic latte is #FFF8E7.

==Discovery of the color==

Finding the average color of the universe was not the focus of the study. Rather, the study examined spectral analysis of different galaxies to study [[star]] formation. Like [[Fraunhofer lines]], the dark lines displayed in the study's spectral ranges display older and younger stars and allow Glazebrook and Baldry to determine the age of different galaxies and star systems. What the study revealed is that the overwhelming majority of stars formed about 5 billion years ago. Because these stars would have been "brighter" in the past, the color of the universe changes over time shifting from blue to red as more blue stars change to yellow and eventually [[red giants]].

As light from distant galaxies reaches the Earth, the average "color of the universe" (as seen from Earth) tends towards pure white, due to the light coming from the stars when they were much younger and bluer.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.astro.ljmu.ac.uk/~ikb/Cosmic-Spectrum.html|title=The Cosmic Spectrum|last=Glazebrook|first=Karl|website=www.astro.ljmu.ac.uk|access-date=2017-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Naming of the color===
The corrected color was initially published on the Johns Hopkins News website and updated on the team's initial announcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.astro.ljmu.ac.uk/~ikb/press/color.html|title=Headlines@Hopkins: Johns Hopkins University News Releases|website=www.astro.ljmu.ac.uk|access-date=2017-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple news outlets, including [[NPR]] and [[BBC News|BBC]], displayed the color in stories&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/programs/atc/features/2002/jan/aas/020110.aas.html|title=NPR : The Color of the Universe Is...|last=Valentine|first=Vikki|website=www.npr.org|access-date=2017-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some relayed the request by Glazebrook on the announcement asking for suggestions for names, jokingly adding all were welcome as long as they were not "beige".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/1861957.stm|title=Universe is off colour|last=|first=|date=March 8, 2002|website=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2017-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2002/03/universe-beige-not-turquoise/|title=Universe: Beige, not Turquoise|work=WIRED|access-date=2017-08-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These were the results of a vote of the scientists involved based on the new color:&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pha.jhu.edu/~kgb/cosspec/topten.htm|title=The Cosmic Spectrum|date=2002-10-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021005185037/http://www.pha.jhu.edu/~kgb/cosspec/topten.htm|archive-date=2002-10-05|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Drum's suggestion of "cappuccino cosmico" received the most votes, the researchers favored Drum's other suggestion, "cosmic latte". This is because the similar "Latteo" means "Milky" in Italian, [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo's]] native language. It also leads to the similarity to the Italian term for the Milky Way, "Via Lattea", and they enjoyed the fact that the color would be similar to the Milky Way's average color as well, as it is part of the sum of the universe.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2002/07/01/science/6faba612-7ee5-49bf-a652-6a0eae42d7c5/|title=SCIENCE|date=2002-07-01|work=The Washington Post|access-date=2017-08-17|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also claimed to be "caffeine biased".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Drum came up with the name while sitting in a [[Starbucks]] drinking a [[latte]] and reading the ''Washington Post''. Drum noticed that the color of the universe as displayed in the newspaper was the same color as his latte.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2763">The '''Dukhin number''' ('''{{math|Du}}''') is a dimensionless quantity that characterizes the contribution of the [[surface conductivity]] to various [[electrokinetic]] and electroacoustic effects, as well as to [[electrical conductivity]] and [[permittivity]] of fluid [[heterogeneous]] systems. 

==Overview==
It was introduced by Lyklema in “Fundamentals of Interface and Colloid Science”.&lt;ref&gt;Lyklema, J.J. "Fundamentals of Interface and Colloid Science", vol.2, page.3.208, 1995 {{ISBN|978-0-12-460524-4}}.&lt;!-- 10.1016/S1874-5679(06)80006-1? --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  A recent IUPAC Technical Report used this term explicitly and detailed several means of measurement in physical systems.&lt;ref name='PAC'&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Delgado |first1=A. V. |last2=González-Caballero |first2=F. |last3=Hunter |first3=R. J. |last4=Koopal |first4=L. K. |last5=Lyklema |first5=J.  |year=2005 |title=Measurement and Interpretation of Electrokinetic Phenomena (IUPAC Technical Report) |journal=[[Pure and Applied Chemistry]] |volume=77 |issue=10 |pages=1753–1805 |doi=10.1351/pac200577101753|url=http://digibug.ugr.es/bitstream/10481/29099/1/DelgadoMeasurements.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dukhin number is a ratio of the [[surface conductivity]] &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;\kappa^{\sigma}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt; to the fluid bulk electrical conductivity K&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; multiplied by particle size ''a'':

:&lt;math&gt; {\rm Du} = \frac{\kappa^{\sigma}}{{\Kappa_m}a}.&lt;/math&gt;

There is another expression of this number that is valid when the surface conductivity is associated only with ions motion above the [[slipping plane]] in the [[double layer (interfacial)|double layer]]. In this case, the value of the surface conductivity depends on ζ-potential, which leads to the following expression for the Dukhin number for symmetrical electrolyte with equal ions [[diffusion coefficient]]:

:&lt;math&gt; {\rm Du} = \frac{2(1+3m/z^2)}{{\kappa}a}\left(\mathrm{cosh}\frac{zF\zeta}{2RT}-1\right),&lt;/math&gt;

where the parameter ''m'' characterizes the contribution of [[electro-osmosis]] into motion of ions within the double layer

:&lt;math&gt; m = \frac{2\varepsilon_0\varepsilon_m R^2T^2}{3\eta F^2 D}.&lt;/math&gt;

* ''F'' is [[Faraday constant]]
* ''T'' is [[absolute temperature]]
* ''R'' is [[gas constant]]
* ''C'' is ions concentration in bulk
* ''z'' is [[ion]] [[valence (chemistry)|valency]]
* ζ is [[electrokinetic potential]]
* ε&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is [[vacuum]] [[dielectric]] [[permittivity]]
* ε&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; is fluid dielectric permittivity
* η is [[dynamic viscosity]]
* ''D'' is [[diffusion coefficient]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6177">'''Dynamical dimensional reduction''' or '''spontaneous dimensional reduction''' is the apparent reduction in the number of spacetime dimensions as a function of the distance scale, or conversely the energy scale, with which spacetime is probed. At least within the current level of experimental precision, our universe has three dimensions of space and one of time. However, the idea that the number of dimensions may increase at extremely small length scales was first proposed more than a century ago,&lt;ref&gt;Nordstrom, G. Z. Phys. 15 (1914) 504.&lt;/ref&gt; and is now fairly commonplace in theoretical physics. Contrary to this, a number of recent results in quantum gravity suggest the opposite behavior, a dynamical reduction of the number of spacetime dimensions at small length scales. 
== Evidence for dimensional reduction==
The phenomenon of dimensional reduction has now been reported in a number of different approaches to quantum gravity. String theory,&lt;ref&gt;Atick, J. J. Witten, E.; [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0550321388901514?via%3Dihub The Hagedorn Transition and the Number of Degrees of Freedom of String Theory].&lt;/ref&gt; causal dynamical triangulations,&lt;ref&gt;Ambjorn, J. Jurkiewicz, J. Loll, R.; [https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.95.171301 Spectral Dimension of the Universe].&lt;/ref&gt; renormalization group approaches,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Lauscher, O. M. Reuter, E.; [http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1126-6708/2005/10/050/meta Fractal Spacetime Structure in Asymptotically Safe Gravity].&lt;/ref&gt; noncommutative geometry,&lt;ref&gt;Benedetti, D.; Fractal properties of quantum spacetime [https://arxiv.org/abs/0811.1396 arXiv:0811.1396].&lt;/ref&gt; loop quantum gravity&lt;ref&gt;Modesto, L.; Fractal Structure of Loop Quantum Gravity [https://arxiv.org/abs/0812.2214 arXiv:0812.2214].&lt;/ref&gt; and Horava-Lifshitz gravity&lt;ref&gt;Horava, P.; Spectral Dimension of the Universe in Quantum Gravity at a Lifshitz Point [https://arxiv.org/abs/0902.3657 arXiv:0902.3657].&lt;/ref&gt; all find that the dimensionality of spacetime appears to decrease from approximately 4 on large distance scales to approximately 2 on small distance scales. 

The evidence for dimensional reduction has come mainly, although not exclusively, from calculations of the spectral dimension. The spectral dimension is a measure of the effective dimension of a manifold at different resolution scales. Early numerical simulations within the [[Causal_dynamical_triangulation|causal dynamical triangulation]] (CDT) approach to quantum gravity found a spectral dimension of 4.02 ± 0.10 at large distances and 1.80 ± 0.25 at small distances. This result created significant interest in dimensional reduction within the quantum gravity community. A more recent study of the same point in the parameter space of CDT found consistent results, namely 4.05 ± 0.17 at large distances and 1.97 ± 0.27 at small distances.&lt;ref&gt;Coumbe, D. N. Jurkiewicz, J.; [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FJHEP03%282015%29151 Evidence for Asymptotic Safety from Dimensional Reduction in Causal Dynamical Triangulations,][https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.7712 arXiv:1411.7712].&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, there is no consensus on the correct theoretical explanation for the mechanism of dimensional reduction.  

== Possible explanations ==

The ubiquity and consistency of dimensional reduction in quantum gravity has driven the search for a theoretical understanding of this phenomenon. Currently, there exist few proposed explanations for the observation of dimensional reduction. 

One proposal is that of scale invariance. There is growing evidence that gravity may be nonperturbatively renormalizable as described by the asymptotic safety program, which requires the existence of a non-Gaussian fixed point at high energies towards which the couplings defining the theory flow.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; At such a fixed point gravity must be scale invariant, and hence Newton's constant must be dimensionless. Only in 2-dimensional spacetime is Newton's constant dimensionless, and so in this scenario going to higher energies and hence flowing towards the fixed point should correspond to the dimensionality of spacetime reducing to the value 2. This explanation is not entirely satisfying as it does not explain why such a fixed point should exist in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;Carlip, S.; Spontaneous Dimensional Reduction in Short-Distance Quantum Gravity? [https://arxiv.org/abs/0909.3329 arXiv:0909.3329].&lt;/ref&gt;

A second possible explanation for dimensional reduction is that of asymptotic silence. General relativity exhibits so-called asymptotic silence in the vicinity of a spacelike singularity, which is the narrowing or focusing of light cones close to the Planck scale leading to a causal decoupling of nearby spacetime points. In this scenario, each point has a preferred spatial direction, and geodesics see a reduced (1 + 1)-dimensional spacetime.&lt;ref&gt;Carlip, S.; Dimension and Dimensional Reduction in Quantum Gravity [https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05417 arXiv:1705.05417].&lt;/ref&gt;

Dimensional reduction implies a deformation or violation of Lorentz invariance and typically predicts an energy dependent speed of light.&lt;ref&gt;Sotiriou, T. Visser, M. Weinfurtner, S.; From dispersion relations to spectral dimension - and back again [https://arxiv.org/abs/1105.6098 arXiv:1105.6098].&lt;/ref&gt; Given such radical consequences, an alternative proposal is that dimensional reduction should not be taken literally, but should instead be viewed as a hint of new Planck scale physics.&lt;ref&gt;Coumbe, D. N.; [https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.91.124040 Hypothesis on the nature of time,][https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04320 arXiv:1502.04320].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coumbe, D. N.; [http://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S021827181750119X Quantum gravity without vacuum dispersion,][https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02519 arXiv:1512.02519].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chronology==
{{Main|History of Earth}}

===Formation===
[[File:Protoplanetary-disk.jpg|thumb|Artist's impression of the early Solar System's planetary disk]]
The oldest material found in the [[Solar System]] is dated to {{val|4.5672|0.0006|ul=billion years ago}} (Bya).&lt;ref name=bowring_housch1995/&gt; By {{val|4.54|0.04|u=Bya}}&lt;ref name="age_earth1" /&gt; the primordial Earth had formed. The bodies in [[Formation and evolution of the Solar System|the Solar System formed and evolved]] with the Sun. In theory, a [[solar nebula]] partitions a volume out of a [[molecular cloud]] by gravitational collapse, which begins to spin and flatten into a [[circumstellar disk]], and then the planets grow out of that disk with the Sun. A nebula contains gas, ice grains, and [[Cosmic dust|dust]] (including [[primordial nuclide]]s). According to [[nebular theory]], [[planetesimal]]s formed by [[accretion (astrophysics)|accretion]], with the primordial Earth taking 10–{{val|20|ul=million years}} (Mys) to form.&lt;ref name=nature418_6901_949/&gt;

A subject of research is the formation of the Moon, some 4.53 Bya.&lt;ref name=science310_5754_1671/&gt; A leading hypothesis is that it was formed by accretion from material loosed from Earth after a [[Mars]]-sized object, named [[Theia (planet)|Theia]], [[giant impact hypothesis|hit]] Earth.&lt;ref name=reilly20091022/&gt; In this view, the mass of Theia was approximately 10 percent of Earth,&lt;ref name=canup_asphaug2001a/&gt; it hit Earth with a glancing blow and some of its mass merged with Earth.&lt;ref name=canup_asphaug2001b/&gt; Between approximately 4.1 and {{val|3.8|u=Bya}}, numerous [[Impact event|asteroid impacts]] during the [[Late Heavy Bombardment]] caused significant changes to the greater surface environment of the Moon and, by inference, to that of Earth.

===Geological history===
{{Main|Geological history of Earth}}
[[File:USA 10654 Bryce Canyon Luca Galuzzi 2007.jpg|thumb|[[Hoodoo (geology)|Hoodoos]] at the [[Bryce Canyon National Park]], [[Utah]]]]

Earth's atmosphere and oceans were formed by [[Volcano|volcanic activity]] and [[outgassing]]. Water vapor from these sources [[origin of the world's oceans|condensed]] into the oceans, augmented by water and ice from asteroids, [[protoplanet]]s, and [[comet]]s.&lt;ref name="watersource"/&gt; In [[faint young Sun paradox|this model]], atmospheric "[[greenhouse gas]]es" kept the oceans from freezing when the newly forming Sun had only 70% of its [[solar luminosity|current luminosity]].&lt;ref name=asp2002/&gt; By {{val|3.5|u=Bya}}, [[Earth's magnetic field]] was established, which helped prevent the atmosphere from being stripped away by the [[solar wind]].&lt;ref name=physorg20100304/&gt;

A crust formed when the molten outer layer of Earth cooled [[Phase transition|to form]] a solid. The two models&lt;ref name=williams_santosh2004/&gt; that explain land mass propose either a steady growth to the present-day forms&lt;ref name=science164_1229/&gt; or, more likely, a rapid growth&lt;ref name=tp322_19/&gt; early in Earth history&lt;ref name=rg6_175/&gt; followed by a long-term steady continental area.&lt;ref name=science310_5756_1947/&gt;&lt;ref name=jaes23_799/&gt;&lt;ref name=ajes38_613/&gt; Continents formed by [[plate tectonics]], a process ultimately driven by the continuous loss of heat from Earth's interior. Over [[Geologic time scale|the period]] of hundreds of millions of years, the [[supercontinent]]s have assembled and broken apart. Roughly {{val|750|u=million years ago}} (Mya), one of the earliest known supercontinents, [[Rodinia]], began to break apart. The continents later recombined to form [[Pannotia]] {{val|600|–|540|u=Mya}}, then finally [[Pangaea]], which also broke apart {{val|180|u=Mya}}.&lt;ref name=as92_324/&gt;

The present pattern of [[ice age]]s began about {{val|40|u=Mya}} and then intensified during the [[Pleistocene]] about {{val|3|u=Mya}}. High-[[latitude]] regions have since undergone repeated cycles of glaciation and thaw, repeating about every {{val|40000|-|100000|u=years|fmt=commas}}.

During the [[Neoproterozoic]], {{val|750|to|580|u=Mya}}, much of Earth might have been covered in ice. This hypothesis has been termed "[[Snowball Earth]]", and it is of particular interest because it preceded the [[Cambrian explosion]], when multicellular life forms significantly increased in complexity.&lt;ref name=kirschvink1992/&gt; Following the Cambrian explosion, {{val|535|u=Mya}}, there have been five [[Extinction event|mass extinctions]].&lt;ref name="sci215_4539_1501" /&gt; The [[Cretaceous–Tertiary extinction event|most recent such event]] was {{val|66|u=Mya}}, when [[Chicxulub impactor|an asteroid impact]] triggered the extinction of the non-[[bird|avian]] [[dinosaur]]s and other large reptiles, but spared some small animals such as [[mammal]]s, which at the time resembled [[shrew]]s. Mammalian life has diversified over the past {{val|66|u=Mys}}, and several million years ago an African ape-like animal such as ''[[Orrorin tugenensis]]'' gained the ability to stand upright.&lt;ref name="gould1994" /&gt; This facilitated tool use and encouraged communication that provided the nutrition and stimulation needed for a larger brain, which led to the [[Human evolution|evolution of humans]].

The shape of Earth is approximately [[oblate spheroid]]al. Due to [[rotation]], the Earth is flattened at the poles and [[equatorial bulge|bulging]] around the [[equator]].&lt;ref name=milbert_smith96/&gt; The diameter of the Earth at the equator is {{convert|43|km|mi}} larger than the [[Geographical pole|pole]]-to-pole diameter.&lt;ref name="ngdc2006"/&gt; Thus the point on the surface farthest from Earth's [[center of mass]] is the summit of the equatorial [[Chimborazo (volcano)|Chimborazo]] volcano in [[Ecuador]].&lt;ref name=ps20_5_16/&gt;&lt;ref name=lancet365_9462_831/&gt;&lt;ref name=tall_tales/&gt;&lt;ref name="The 'Highest' Spot on Earth"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=9428163 |title=The 'Highest' Spot on Earth |publisher=NPR |date=7 April 2007 |accessdate=31 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average diameter of the reference spheroid is {{convert|12742|km|mi}}. Local [[topography]] deviates from this idealized spheroid, although on a global scale these deviations are small compared to Earth's radius: The maximum deviation of only 0.17% is at the [[Mariana Trench]] ({{convert|10911|m|ft}} below local sea level), whereas [[Mount Everest]] ({{convert|8848|m|ft}} above local sea level) represents a deviation of 0.14%.{{refn|group=n| If Earth were shrunk to the size of a [[billiard ball]], some areas of Earth such as large mountain ranges and oceanic trenches would feel like tiny imperfections, whereas much of the planet, including the [[Great Plains]] and the [[abyssal plain]]s, would feel smoother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://billiards.colostate.edu/bd_articles/2013/june13.pdf |title=Is a Pool Ball Smoother than the Earth? |publisher=Billiards Digest |date=1 June 2013 |accessdate=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In [[geodesy]], the exact shape that Earth's oceans would adopt in the absence of land and perturbations such as tides and winds is called the [[geoid]]. More precisely, the geoid is the surface of gravitational equipotential at [[mean sea level]].

[[Earth mass|Earth's mass]] is approximately {{val|5.97|e=24|ul=kg}} (5,970 [[yottagram|Yg]]). It is composed mostly of [[iron]] (32.1%), [[oxygen]] (30.1%), [[silicon]] (15.1%), [[magnesium]] (13.9%), [[sulfur]] (2.9%), [[nickel]] (1.8%), [[calcium]] (1.5%), and [[aluminium]] (1.4%), with the remaining 1.2% consisting of trace amounts of other elements. Due to [[mass segregation]], the core region is estimated to be primarily composed of iron (88.8%), with smaller amounts of nickel (5.8%), sulfur (4.5%), and less than 1% trace elements.&lt;ref name=pnas71_12_6973/&gt;

The most common rock constituents of the crust are nearly all [[oxide]]s: chlorine, sulfur, and fluorine are the important exceptions to this and their total amount in any rock is usually much less than 1%. Over 99% of the crust is composed of 11 oxides, principally silica, alumina, iron oxides, lime, magnesia, potash, and soda.&lt;ref name=brown_mussett1981/&gt;&lt;ref name=pnas71_12_6973/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1911|title=Petrology |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internal structure===
{{Main|Structure of the Earth}}
Earth's interior, like that of the other terrestrial planets, is divided into layers by their [[chemical]] or physical ([[Rheology|rheological]]) properties. The outer layer is a chemically distinct [[Silicate minerals|silicate]] solid crust, which is underlain by a highly [[viscous]] solid mantle. The crust is separated from the mantle by the [[Mohorovičić discontinuity]]. The thickness of the crust varies from about {{convert|6|km|mi}} under the oceans to {{convert|30|-|50|km|mi|abbr=on}} for the continents. The crust and the cold, rigid, top of the [[upper mantle]] are collectively known as the lithosphere, and it is of the lithosphere that the tectonic plates are composed. Beneath the lithosphere is the [[asthenosphere]], a relatively low-viscosity layer on which the lithosphere rides. Important changes in crystal structure within the mantle occur at {{convert|410|and|660|km|mi|abbr=on}} below the surface, spanning a [[Transition zone (Earth)|transition zone]] that separates the upper and lower mantle. Beneath the mantle, an extremely low viscosity liquid [[outer core]] lies above a solid [[inner core]].&lt;ref name=tanimoto_ahrens1995/&gt; The Earth's inner core might rotate at a slightly higher [[angular velocity]] than the remainder of the planet, advancing by 0.1–0.5° per year.&lt;ref name=science309_5739_1313/&gt; The radius of the inner core is about one fifth of that of Earth.

===Heat===
{{Main|Earth's internal heat budget}}
Earth's [[internal heat]] comes from a combination of residual heat from [[planetary accretion]] (about 20%) and heat produced through [[radioactive decay]] (80%).&lt;ref name="turcotte"/&gt; The major heat-producing [[isotope]]s within Earth are [[potassium-40]], [[uranium-238]], and [[thorium-232]].&lt;ref name=sanders20031210/&gt; At the center, the temperature may be up to {{convert|6000|C|F}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Earth's Centre is 1000 Degrees Hotter than Previously Thought |url=http://www.esrf.eu/news/general/Earth-Center-Hotter |website=The European Synchrotron (ESRF) |accessdate=12 April 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6HKckNXMF?url=http://www.esrf.eu/news/general/Earth-Center-Hotter/Earth-Centre-Hotter |archivedate=12 June 2013 |date=25 April 2013 |deadurl=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the pressure could reach {{convert|360|GPa|e6psi|abbr=unit|lk=on}}.&lt;ref name=ptrsl360_1795_1227/&gt; Because much of the heat is provided by radioactive decay, scientists postulate that early in Earth's history, before isotopes with short half-lives were depleted, Earth's heat production was much higher. At approximately {{val|3|ul=Gyr}}, twice the present-day heat would have been produced, increasing the rates of [[mantle convection]] and plate tectonics, and allowing the production of uncommon igneous rocks such as [[komatiite]]s that are rarely formed today.&lt;ref name="turcotte" /&gt;&lt;ref name=epsl121_1/&gt;

{{Main|Plate tectonics}}
Earth's mechanically rigid outer layer, the lithosphere, is divided into tectonic plates. These plates are rigid segments that move relative to each other at one of three boundaries types: At [[Convergent boundary|convergent boundaries]], two plates come together; at [[Divergent boundary|divergent boundaries]], two plates are pulled apart; and at [[Transform boundary|transform boundaries]], two plates slide past one another laterally. Along these plate boundaries, [[earthquake]]s, [[Volcanism|volcanic activity]], [[Orogeny|mountain-building]], and [[oceanic trench]] formation can occur.&lt;ref name=kious_tilling1999/&gt; The tectonic plates ride on top of the asthenosphere, the solid but less-viscous part of the upper mantle that can flow and move along with the plates.&lt;ref name=seligman2008/&gt;

[[File:Mount-Everest.jpg|thumb|left|[[Orogeny|Mountains build up]] when tectonic plates move toward each other, forcing rock up. The highest [[mountain]] on Earth above sea level is [[Mount Everest]].]]

As the tectonic plates migrate, oceanic crust is [[Subduction|subducted]] under the leading edges of the plates at convergent boundaries. At the same time, the upwelling of mantle material at divergent boundaries creates mid-ocean ridges. The combination of these processes recycles the [[oceanic crust]] back into the mantle. Due to this recycling, most of the ocean floor is less than {{val|100|u=Myr}} old. The oldest oceanic crust is located in the Western Pacific and is estimated to be {{val|200|u=Myr}} old.&lt;ref name=duennebier1999/&gt;&lt;ref name=noaa20070307/&gt; By comparison, the oldest dated [[continental crust]] is {{val|4030|u=Myr|fmt=commas}}.&lt;ref name=cmp134_3/&gt;

The seven major plates are the [[Pacific Plate|Pacific]], [[North American Plate|North American]], [[Eurasian Plate|Eurasian]], [[African Plate|African]], [[Antarctic Plate|Antarctic]], [[Indo-Australian Plate|Indo-Australian]], and [[South American Plate|South American]]. Other notable plates include the [[Arabian Plate]], the [[Caribbean Plate]], the [[Nazca Plate]] off the west coast of South America and the [[Scotia Plate]] in the southern Atlantic Ocean. The Australian Plate fused with the Indian Plate between {{val|50|and|55|u=Mya}}. The fastest-moving plates are the oceanic plates, with the [[Cocos Plate]] advancing at a rate of {{convert|75|mm/year|in/year|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name=podp2000/&gt; and the Pacific Plate moving {{convert|52|–|69|mm/year|in/year|abbr=on}}. At the other extreme, the slowest-moving plate is the Eurasian Plate, progressing at a typical rate of {{convert|21|mm/year|in/year|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=gps_time_series/&gt;

Earth's hydrosphere consists chiefly of the oceans, but technically includes all water surfaces in the world, including inland seas, lakes, rivers, and underground waters down to a depth of {{convert|2000|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The deepest underwater location is [[Challenger Deep]] of the Mariana Trench in the Pacific Ocean with a depth of {{convert|10911.4|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref group="n" name="trench_depth"/&gt;&lt;ref name=kaiko7000/&gt;

The mass of the oceans is approximately 1.35{{e|18}}&amp;nbsp;[[metric ton]]s or about 1/4400 of Earth's total mass. The oceans cover an area of {{convert|361.8|e6km2|e6mi2|abbr=unit}} with a mean depth of {{convert|3682|m|ft|abbr=on}}, resulting in an estimated volume of {{convert|1.332|e9km3|e6cumi|abbr=unit}}.&lt;ref name=ocean23_2_112/&gt; If all of Earth's crustal surface were at the same elevation as a smooth sphere, the depth of the resulting world ocean would be {{convert|2.7|to|2.8|km|mi|2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/559627/sphere-depth-of-the-ocean |title=sphere depth of the ocean&amp;nbsp;– hydrology |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ase.tufts.edu/cosmos/print_chapter.asp?id=4 |title=Third rock from the Sun&amp;nbsp;– restless Earth |work=NASA's Cosmos |accessdate=12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 97.5% of the water is [[saline water|saline]]; the remaining 2.5% is [[fresh water]]. Most fresh water, about 68.7%, is present as ice in [[ice cap]]s and [[glacier]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://water.usgs.gov/edu/earthwherewater.html |title=The World's Water |last1=Perlman |first1=Howard |date=17 March 2014 |accessdate=12 April 2015 |work=USGS Water-Science School}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The average [[salinity]] of Earth's oceans is about 35&amp;nbsp;grams of salt per kilogram of sea water (3.5% salt).&lt;ref name=kennish2001/&gt; Most of this salt was released from volcanic activity or extracted from cool igneous rocks.&lt;ref name=mullen2002/&gt; The oceans are also a reservoir of dissolved atmospheric gases, which are essential for the survival of many aquatic life forms.&lt;ref name=natsci_oxy4/&gt; Sea water has an important influence on the world's climate, with the oceans acting as a large [[heat reservoir]].&lt;ref name=michon2006/&gt; Shifts in the oceanic temperature distribution can cause significant weather shifts, such as the [[El Niño–Southern Oscillation]].&lt;ref name=sample2005/&gt;

Earth's [[biosphere]] has significantly altered its [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]].

The ozone layer blocks [[ultraviolet]] [[solar radiation]], permitting life on land.&lt;ref name="Harrison 2002"/&gt; Other atmospheric functions important to life include transporting water vapor, providing useful gases, causing small [[meteor]]s to burn up before they strike the surface, and moderating temperature.&lt;ref name="atmosphere"/&gt; This last phenomenon is known as the [[greenhouse effect]]: trace molecules within the atmosphere serve to capture [[thermal energy]] emitted from the ground, thereby raising the average temperature. Water vapor, carbon dioxide, [[methane]], [[nitrous oxide]], and [[ozone]] are the primary greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Without this heat-retention effect, the average surface temperature would be {{convert|−18|C|F}}, in contrast to the current {{convert|+15|C|F}},&lt;ref name="Pidwirny2006_7" /&gt; and life on Earth probably would not exist in its current form.&lt;ref name=Narottam2008/&gt; In May 2017, glints of light, seen as twinkling from an orbiting satellite a million miles away, were found to be [[Reflection (physics)|reflected light]] from [[ice crystals]] in the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="NYT-20170519"&gt;{{cite news |last=St. Fleur |first=Nicholas |title=Spotting Mysterious Twinkles on Earth From a Million Miles Away |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/19/science/dscovr-satellite-ice-glints-earth-atmosphere.html |date=19 May 2017 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=20 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GRL-201760515"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Marshak |first1=Alexander |last2=Várnai |first2=Tamás |last3=Kostinski |first3=Alexander |title=Terrestrial glint seen from deep space: oriented ice crystals detected from the Lagrangian point |date=15 May 2017 |journal=[[Geophysical Research Letters]] |doi=10.1002/2017GL073248 |volume=44 |issue=10 |pages=5197–5202 |bibcode=2017GeoRL..44.5197M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earth's atmosphere has no definite boundary, slowly becoming thinner and fading into outer space. Three-quarters of the atmosphere's mass is contained within the first {{convert|11|km|mi|abbr=on}} of the surface. This lowest layer is called the troposphere. Energy from the Sun heats this layer, and the surface below, causing expansion of the air. This lower-density air then rises and is replaced by cooler, higher-density air. The result is [[atmospheric circulation]] that drives the weather and climate through redistribution of thermal energy.&lt;ref name="moran2005"/&gt;

The primary atmospheric circulation bands consist of the [[trade winds]] in the equatorial region below 30° latitude and the [[westerlies]] in the mid-latitudes between 30° and 60°.&lt;ref name="berger2002"/&gt; [[Ocean current]]s are also important factors in determining climate, particularly the [[thermohaline circulation]] that distributes thermal energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar regions.&lt;ref name=rahmstorf2003/&gt;

Water vapor generated through surface evaporation is transported by circulatory patterns in the atmosphere. When atmospheric conditions permit an uplift of warm, humid air, this water condenses and falls to the surface as precipitation.&lt;ref name="moran2005" /&gt; Most of the water is then transported to lower elevations by river systems and usually returned to the oceans or deposited into lakes. This [[water cycle]] is a vital mechanism for supporting life on land and is a primary factor in the erosion of surface features over geological periods. Precipitation patterns vary widely, ranging from several meters of water per year to less than a millimeter. Atmospheric circulation, topographic features, and temperature differences determine the average precipitation that falls in each region.&lt;ref name=hydrologic_cycle/&gt;

The amount of solar energy reaching Earth's surface decreases with increasing latitude. At higher latitudes, the sunlight reaches the surface at lower angles, and it must pass through thicker columns of the atmosphere. As a result, the mean annual air temperature at sea level decreases by about {{convert|0.4|C-change|F-change|1}} per degree of latitude from the equator.&lt;ref name=sadava_heller2006/&gt; Earth's surface can be subdivided into specific latitudinal belts of approximately homogeneous climate. Ranging from the equator to the polar regions, these are the [[Tropics|tropical]] (or equatorial), [[Subtropics|subtropical]], [[temperate]] and [[Polar region|polar]] climates.&lt;ref name=climate_zones/&gt;

This latitudinal rule has several anomalies:
* Proximity to oceans moderates the climate. For example, the [[Scandinavian Peninsula]] has more moderate climate than similarly northern latitudes of [[northern Canada]].
* The [[wind]] enables this moderating effect. The windward side of a land mass experiences more moderation than the leeward side. In the Northern Hemisphere, the prevailing wind is west-to-east, and western coasts tend to be milder than eastern coasts. This is seen in Eastern North America and Western Europe, where rough continental climates appear on the east coast on parallels with mild climates on the other side of the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.livescience.com/13573-east-coast-colder-europe-west-coast.html |title=Why U.S. East Coast is colder than Europe's West Coast |publisher=Live Science |date=5 April 2011 |accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Southern Hemisphere, the prevailing wind is east-to-west, and the eastern coasts are milder.
* The distance from the Earth to the Sun varies. The Earth is closest to the Sun (at [[perihelion]]) in January, which is summer in the Southern Hemisphere. It is furthest away (at [[aphelion]]) in July, which is summer in the Northern Hemisphere, and only 93.55% of the solar radiation from the Sun falls on a given square area of land than at perihelion. Despite this, there are larger land masses in the Northern Hemisphere, which are easier to heat than the seas. Consequently, summers are {{convert|2.3|C-change|F-change|0}} warmer in the Northern Hemisphere than in the Southern Hemisphere under similar conditions.&lt;ref name="Earth at Aphelion"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spaceweather.com/glossary/aphelion.html |title=Earth at Aphelion |publisher=Space Weather |date=July 2008 |accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The climate is colder at high altitudes than at sea level because of the decreased air density.

The commonly used [[Köppen climate classification]] system has five broad groups ([[tropical climate|humid tropics]], [[arid]], [[humid subtropical climate|humid middle latitudes]], [[Continental climate|continental]] and cold [[polar climate|polar]]), which are further divided into more specific subtypes.&lt;ref name="berger2002" /&gt; The Köppen system rates regions of terrain based on observed temperature and precipitation.

The highest air temperature ever measured on Earth was {{convert|56.7|C|F}} in [[Furnace Creek, California]], in [[Death Valley National Park|Death Valley]], in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/highest-recorded-temperature/ |title=Highest recorded temperature |publisher=Guinness World Records |accessdate=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lowest air temperature ever directly measured on Earth was {{convert|-89.2|C|F}} at [[Vostok Station]] in 1983,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lyons |first1=Walter A |title=The Handy Weather Answer Book |date=1997 |publisher=Visible Ink Press |location=Detroit, Michigan |isbn=978-0-7876-1034-0 |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; but satellites have used remote sensing to measure temperatures as low as {{convert|-94.7|C|F}} in [[East Antarctica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/10/coldest-temperature-recorded-earth-antarctica-guinness-book |title=Coldest temperature ever recorded on Earth in Antarctica |journal=The Guardian |date=10 December 2013 |accessdate=12 July 2015|publisher=Associated Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; These temperature records are only measurements made with modern instruments from the 20th century onwards and likely do not reflect the full range of temperature on Earth.

====Upper atmosphere====
[[File:Full moon partially obscured by atmosphere.jpg|thumb|This view from orbit shows the [[full moon]] partially obscured by Earth's atmosphere.]]
Above the troposphere, the atmosphere is usually divided into the [[stratosphere]], [[mesosphere]], and [[thermosphere]].&lt;ref name="atmosphere" /&gt; Each layer has a different [[lapse rate]], defining the rate of change in temperature with height. Beyond these, the [[exosphere]] thins out into the [[magnetosphere]], where the geomagnetic fields interact with the [[solar wind]].&lt;ref name=sciweek2004/&gt; Within the stratosphere is the ozone layer, a component that partially shields the surface from ultraviolet light and thus is important for life on Earth. The [[Kármán line]], defined as 100&amp;nbsp;km above Earth's surface, is a working definition for the boundary between the atmosphere and [[outer space]].&lt;ref name=cordoba2004/&gt;

Thermal energy causes some of the molecules at the outer edge of the atmosphere to increase their velocity to the point where they can escape from Earth's gravity. This causes a slow but steady [[Atmospheric escape|loss of the atmosphere into space]]. Because unfixed [[hydrogen]] has a low [[molecular mass]], it can achieve [[escape velocity]] more readily, and it leaks into outer space at a greater rate than other gases.&lt;ref name=jas31_4_1118/&gt; The leakage of hydrogen into space contributes to the shifting of Earth's atmosphere and surface from an initially [[redox|reducing]] state to its current [[Redox|oxidizing]] one. Photosynthesis provided a source of free oxygen, but the loss of reducing agents such as hydrogen is thought to have been a necessary precondition for the widespread accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=sci293_5531_839/&gt; Hence the ability of hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere may have influenced the nature of life that developed on Earth.&lt;ref name=abedon1997/&gt; In the current, oxygen-rich atmosphere most hydrogen is converted into water before it has an opportunity to escape. Instead, most of the hydrogen loss comes from the destruction of methane in the upper atmosphere.&lt;ref name=arwps4_265/&gt;

===Gravitational field===

[[File:Geoids sm.jpg|thumb|Earth's gravity measured by NASA's [[Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment|GRACE]] mission, showing deviations from the [[theoretical gravity]]. Red shows where gravity is stronger than the smooth, standard value, and blue shows where it is weaker.]]
The [[gravity of Earth]] is the [[acceleration]] that is imparted to objects due to the distribution of mass within the Earth. Near the Earth's surface, [[gravitational acceleration]] is approximately {{convert|9.8|m/s2|abbr=on}}. Local differences in [[topography]], [[geology]], and deeper tectonic structure cause local and broad, regional differences in the Earth's gravitational field, known as [[Gravity anomaly|gravity anomalies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=A. B. |last1=Watts |first2=S.

===Magnetic field===
{{Main|Earth's magnetic field}}

The main part of [[Earth's magnetic field]] is generated in the core, the site of a [[Dynamo theory|dynamo]] process that converts the kinetic energy of thermally and compositionally driven convection into electrical and magnetic field energy. The field extends outwards from the core, through the mantle, and up to Earth's surface, where it is, approximately, a [[dipole]]. The poles of the dipole are located close to Earth's geographic poles. At the equator of the magnetic field, the magnetic-field strength at the surface is {{nowrap|3.05 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; [[Tesla (unit)|T]]}}, with global [[magnetic dipole moment]] of {{nowrap|7.91 × 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; T m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref name=lang2003/&gt; The convection movements in the core are chaotic; the magnetic poles drift and periodically change alignment. This causes [[Geomagnetic secular variation|secular variation]] of the main field and [[geomagnetic reversal|field reversals]] at irregular intervals averaging a few times every million years. The most recent reversal occurred approximately 700,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=fitzpatrick2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=campbelwh/&gt;

====Magnetosphere====

The extent of Earth's magnetic field in space defines the [[magnetosphere]]. Ions and electrons of the solar wind are deflected by the magnetosphere; solar wind pressure compresses the dayside of the magnetosphere, to about 10 Earth radii, and extends the nightside magnetosphere into a long tail.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt; Because the velocity of the solar wind is greater than the speed at which waves propagate through the solar wind, a supersonic bowshock precedes the dayside magnetosphere within the solar wind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sci.esa.int/jump.cfm?oid=40994 |title=Cluster reveals the reformation of the Earth's bow shock |publisher=European Space Agency |first=Arnaud |last=Masson |date=11 May 2007 |accessdate=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charged particle]]s are contained within the magnetosphere; the plasmasphere is defined by low-energy particles that essentially follow magnetic field lines as Earth rotates;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plasmasphere.nasa.gov/ |title=The Earth's Plasmasphere |publisher=NASA/Marshall Space Flight Center |last=Gallagher |first=Dennis L. |date=14 August 2015 |accessdate=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plasmasphere.nasa.gov/formed.html |title=How the Plasmasphere is Formed |publisher=NASA/Marshall Space Flight Center |last=Gallagher |first=Dennis L. |date=27 May 2015 |accessdate=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ring current is defined by medium-energy particles that drift relative to the geomagnetic field, but with paths that are still dominated by the magnetic field,&lt;ref name="BaumjohannTreumann1997"&gt;{{cite book |title=Basic Space Plasma Physics |publisher=World Scientific |first1=Wolfgang |last1=Baumjohann |first2=Rudolf A. |last2=Treumann |pages=8, 31 |year=1997 |isbn=978-1-86094-079-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Van Allen radiation belt]] are formed by high-energy particles whose motion is essentially random, but otherwise contained by the magnetosphere.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.britannica.com/science/ionosphere-and-magnetosphere/Magnetosphere |title=Ionosphere and magnetosphere |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. |first=Michael B. |last=McElroy |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Van Allen"&gt;{{cite book |title=Origins of Magnetospheric Physics |publisher=University of Iowa Press |last=Van Allen |first=James Alfred |date=2004 |isbn=978-0-87745-921-7 |oclc=646887856}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[magnetic storm]]s and [[substorm]]s, charged particles can be deflected from the outer magnetosphere and especially the magnetotail, directed along field lines into Earth's ionosphere, where atmospheric atoms can be excited and ionized, causing the [[Aurora (astronomy)|aurora]].&lt;ref name=stern2005/&gt;

==Orbit and rotation==

===Rotation===
{{Main|Earth's rotation}}
[[File:EpicEarth-Globespin(2016May29).gif|thumb|right|Earth's rotation imaged by [[Deep Space Climate Observatory|DSCOVR EPIC]] on 29 May 2016, a few weeks before the [[solstice]].]]
Earth's rotation period relative to the Sun—its mean solar day—is {{nowrap|86,400 seconds}} of mean solar time ({{nowrap|86,400.0025 [[SI]] seconds}}).&lt;ref name=aj136_5_1906/&gt; Because Earth's solar day is now slightly longer than it was during the 19th century due to [[tidal acceleration|tidal deceleration]], each day varies between {{nowrap|0 and 2 SI [[millisecond|ms]]}} longer&lt;!--than the previous day or the 19th-C day?

Earth's rotation period relative to the [[fixed star]]s, called its ''stellar day'' by the [[International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service]] (IERS), is {{nowrap|86,164.0989 seconds}} of mean solar time (UT1), or {{nowrap |23{{smallsup|h}} 56{{smallsup|m}} 4.0989{{smallsup|s}}.}}&lt;ref name=IERS/&gt;&lt;ref group="n" name="Aoki"/&gt; Earth's rotation period relative to the [[precession (astronomy)|precessing]] or moving mean [[vernal equinox]], misnamed its ''[[sidereal day]]'', is {{nowrap|86,164.0905 seconds}} of mean solar time (UT1) {{nowrap|(23{{smallsup|h}} 56{{smallsup|m}} 4.0905{{smallsup|s}})}}.&lt;ref name=IERS/&gt; Thus the sidereal day is shorter than the stellar day by about 8.4&amp;nbsp;ms.&lt;ref name=seidelmann1992/&gt; The length of the mean solar day in SI seconds is available from the IERS for the periods 1623–2005&lt;ref name=iers1623/&gt; and 1962–2005.&lt;ref name=iers1962/&gt;

Apart from meteors within the atmosphere and low-orbiting satellites, the main apparent motion of celestial bodies in Earth's sky is to the west at a rate of 15°/h = 15'/min. For bodies near the [[celestial equator]], this is equivalent to an apparent diameter of the Sun or the Moon every two minutes; from Earth's surface, the apparent sizes of the Sun and the Moon are approximately the same.&lt;ref name=zeilik1998/&gt;&lt;ref name=angular/&gt;

===Orbit===
{{Main|Earth's orbit}}
[[File:Pale Blue Dot.png|thumb|upright|The ''[[Pale Blue Dot]]'' photo taken in 1990 by the ''[[Voyager 1]]'' spacecraft showing Earth (center right) from nearly {{convert|4|e9mi|e9km|order=flip|abbr=unit}} away]]

Earth orbits the Sun at an average distance of about {{convert|150|e6km|e6mi|abbr=unit}} every 365.2564 mean solar days, or one [[sidereal year]]. This gives an apparent movement of the Sun eastward with respect to the stars at a rate of about 1°/day, which is one apparent Sun or Moon diameter every 12&amp;nbsp;hours. Due to this motion, on average it takes 24&amp;nbsp;hours—a [[Solar time|solar day]]—for Earth to complete a full rotation about its axis so that the Sun returns to the [[Meridian (astronomy)|meridian]]. The orbital speed of Earth averages about {{convert|29.78|km/s|km/h mph|abbr=on}}, which is fast enough to travel a distance equal to Earth's diameter, about {{convert|12742|km|mi|abbr=on}}, in seven minutes, and the distance to the Moon, {{convert|384000|km|mi|abbr=on}}, in about 3.5 hours.&lt;ref name="earth_fact_sheet" /&gt;

The Moon and Earth orbit a common [[barycenter]] every 27.32&amp;nbsp;days relative to the background stars. When combined with the Earth–Moon system's common orbit around the Sun, the period of the [[synodic month]], from new moon to new moon, is 29.53&amp;nbsp;days. Viewed from the [[celestial pole|celestial north pole]], the motion of Earth, the Moon, and their axial rotations are all [[counterclockwise]]. Viewed from a vantage point above the north poles of both the Sun and Earth, Earth orbits in a counterclockwise direction about the Sun. The orbital and axial planes are not precisely aligned: Earth's [[axial tilt|axis is tilted]] some 23.44&amp;nbsp;degrees from the perpendicular to the Earth–Sun plane (the [[ecliptic]]), and the Earth–Moon plane is tilted up to ±5.1&amp;nbsp;degrees against the Earth–Sun plane. Without this tilt, there would be an eclipse every two weeks, alternating between [[lunar eclipse]]s and [[solar eclipse]]s.&lt;ref name="earth_fact_sheet" /&gt;&lt;ref name="moon_fact_sheet" /&gt;

The [[Hill sphere]], or the sphere of [[Gravity|gravitational]] influence, of the Earth is about {{convert|1.5|e6km|mi|abbr=unit}} in radius.&lt;ref name=vazquez_etal2006 /&gt;&lt;ref group="n" name="hill_radius" /&gt; This is the maximum distance at which the Earth's gravitational influence is stronger than the more distant Sun and planets. Objects must orbit the Earth within this radius, or they can become unbound by the gravitational perturbation of the Sun.

Earth, along with the Solar System, is situated in the [[Milky Way]] and orbits about 28,000&amp;nbsp;[[light-year]]s from its center. It is about 20&amp;nbsp;light-years above the [[galactic plane]] in the [[Orion Arm]].&lt;ref name=nasa20051201 /&gt;

===Axial tilt and seasons===
{{Main|Axial tilt#Earth}}
[[File:AxialTiltObliquity.png|thumb|left|Earth's axial tilt (or [[obliquity]]) and its relation to the [[Rotation|rotation axis]] and [[Orbital plane (astronomy)|plane of orbit]]]]
The axial tilt of the Earth is approximately 23.439281°&lt;ref name="IERS"/&gt; with the axis of its orbit plane, always pointing towards the [[Celestial Poles]]. Due to Earth's axial tilt, the amount of sunlight reaching any given point on the surface varies over the course of the year. This causes the seasonal change in climate, with [[summer]] in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] occurring when the [[Tropic of Cancer]] is facing the Sun, and [[winter]] taking place when the [[Tropic of Capricorn]] in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] faces the Sun. During the summer, the day lasts longer, and the Sun climbs higher in the sky. In winter, the climate becomes cooler and the days shorter. In northern temperate latitudes, the Sun rises north of true east during the summer solstice, and sets north of true west, reversing in the winter. The Sun rises south of true east in the summer for the southern temperate zone and sets south of true west.

Above the [[Arctic Circle]], an extreme case is reached where there is no daylight at all for part of the year, up to six months at the North Pole itself, a [[polar night]]. In the Southern Hemisphere, the situation is exactly reversed, with the [[South Pole]] oriented opposite the direction of the North Pole. Six months later, this pole will experience a [[midnight sun]], a day of 24 hours, again reversing with the South Pole.

By astronomical convention, the four seasons can be determined by the [[solstice]]s—the points in the orbit of maximum axial tilt toward or away from the Sun—and the [[equinox]]es, when the direction of the tilt and the direction to the Sun are perpendicular. In the Northern Hemisphere, [[winter solstice]] currently occurs around 21 December; [[summer solstice]] is near 21 June, [[spring equinox]] is around 20 March and [[autumnal equinox]] is about 22 or 23 September. In the Southern Hemisphere, the situation is reversed, with the summer and winter solstices exchanged and the spring and autumnal equinox dates swapped.&lt;ref name=bromberg2008/&gt;

The angle of Earth's axial tilt is relatively stable over long periods of time. Its axial tilt does undergo [[nutation]]; a slight, irregular motion with a main period of 18.6&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name=lin2006/&gt; The orientation (rather than the angle) of Earth's axis also changes over time, [[precession|precessing]] around in a complete circle over each 25,800&amp;nbsp;year cycle; this precession is the reason for the difference between a sidereal year and a [[tropical year]]. Both of these motions are caused by the varying attraction of the Sun and the Moon on Earth's equatorial bulge. The poles also migrate a few meters across Earth's surface. This [[polar motion]] has multiple, cyclical components, which collectively are termed [[quasiperiodic motion]]. In addition to an annual component to this motion, there is a 14-month cycle called the [[Chandler wobble]]. Earth's rotational velocity also varies in a phenomenon known as length-of-day variation.&lt;ref name=fisher19960205/&gt;

In modern times, Earth's [[perihelion]] occurs around 3 January, and its [[aphelion]] around 4 July. These dates change over time due to precession and other orbital factors, which follow cyclical patterns known as [[Milankovitch cycles]]. The changing Earth–Sun distance causes an increase of about 6.9%&lt;ref group="n" name="solar_energy"/&gt; in solar energy reaching Earth at perihelion relative to aphelion. Because the Southern Hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun at about the same time that Earth reaches the closest approach to the Sun, the Southern Hemisphere receives slightly more energy from the Sun than does the northern over the course of a year. This effect is much less significant than the total energy change due to the axial tilt, and most of the excess energy is absorbed by the higher proportion of water in the Southern Hemisphere.&lt;ref name=williams20051230/&gt;

A study from 2016 suggested that [[Planet Nine]] tilted all [[Solar System]] planets, including Earth's, by about six degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.space.com/34448-planet-nine-solar-system-tilt.html |title=Did the Mysterious 'Planet Nine' Tilt the Solar System? |work=Space.com |first=Charles Q. |last=Choi |date=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Habitability==
[[File:Moraine Lake 17092005.jpg|thumb|The [[Rocky Mountains]] in Canada overlook [[Moraine Lake]].]]
A planet that can sustain life is termed [[Planetary habitability|habitable]], even if life did not originate there. Earth provides liquid water—an environment where complex [[Organic compound|organic molecules]] can assemble and interact, and sufficient energy to sustain [[metabolism]].&lt;ref name=ab2003/&gt; The distance of Earth from the Sun, as well as its orbital eccentricity, rate of rotation, axial tilt, geological history, sustaining atmosphere, and magnetic field all contribute to the current climatic conditions at the surface.&lt;ref name=dole1970/&gt;

===Biosphere===
{{Main|Biosphere}}
A planet's life forms inhabit [[ecosystem]]s, whose total is sometimes said to form a "biosphere". Earth's biosphere is thought to have begun [[evolution|evolving]] about {{val|3.5|u=Gya}}.&lt;ref name="NYT-20131003" /&gt; The biosphere is divided into a number of [[biome]]s, inhabited by broadly similar plants and animals. On land, biomes are separated primarily by differences in latitude, [[elevation|height above sea level]] and [[humidity]]. Terrestrial [[tundra|biomes]] lying within the Arctic or [[Antarctic Circle]]s, at [[Alpine tundra|high altitudes]] or in [[desert|extremely arid areas]] are relatively barren of plant and animal life; [[Latitudinal gradients in species diversity|species diversity]] reaches a peak in [[tropical rainforest|humid lowlands at equatorial latitudes]].&lt;ref name=amnat163_2_192/&gt;

Earth has resources that have been exploited by humans. Those termed [[non-renewable resource]]s, such as [[fossil fuel]]s, only renew over geological timescales.

Large deposits of fossil fuels are obtained from Earth's crust, consisting of [[coal]], [[petroleum]], and [[natural gas]]. These deposits are used by humans both for energy production and as feedstock for chemical production. Mineral [[ore]] bodies have also been formed within the crust through a process of [[ore genesis]], resulting from actions of [[magmatism]], erosion, and plate tectonics.&lt;ref name="Ramdohr"/&gt; These bodies form concentrated sources for many metals and other useful [[chemical element|elements]].

Earth's biosphere produces many useful biological products for humans, including food, [[wood]], [[pharmaceutical]]s, oxygen, and the recycling of many organic wastes. The land-based [[ecosystem]] depends upon [[topsoil]] and fresh water, and the oceanic ecosystem depends upon dissolved nutrients washed down from the land.&lt;ref name=science299_5607_673/&gt; In 1980, {{convert|5053|e6ha|e6km2 e6sqmi|order=out|abbr=unit}} of Earth's land surface consisted of forest and woodlands, {{convert|6788|e6ha|e6km2 e6sqmi|order=out|abbr=unit}} was grasslands and pasture, and {{convert|1501|e6ha|e6km2 e6sqmi|order=out|abbr=unit}} was cultivated as croplands.&lt;ref name="Turner1990"/&gt; The estimated amount of [[irrigated land]] in 1993 was {{convert|2481250|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=cia/&gt; Humans also live on the land by using [[building material]]s to construct shelters.

===Natural and environmental hazards===
[[File:Pavlof2014iss.jpg|thumb|left|A volcano injecting hot ash into the atmosphere]]
Large areas of Earth's surface are subject to extreme weather such as tropical [[cyclone]]s, [[hurricane]]s, or [[typhoon]]s that dominate life in those areas. From 1980 to 2000, these events caused an average of 11,800 human deaths per year.&lt;ref name=walsh2008/&gt; Many places are subject to earthquakes, [[landslide]]s, [[tsunami]]s, [[Types of volcanic eruptions|volcanic eruptions]], [[tornado]]es, [[sinkhole]]s, [[blizzard]]s, floods, droughts, [[wildfire]]s, and other calamities and disasters.

Many localized areas are subject to human-made [[pollution]] of the air and water, [[acid rain]] and toxic substances, loss of vegetation ([[overgrazing]], [[deforestation]], [[desertification]]), loss of wildlife, species [[extinction]], [[soil degradation]], [[soil depletion]] and [[erosion]].

There is a [[scientific consensus]] linking human activities to [[global warming]] due to industrial carbon dioxide emissions. This is predicted to produce changes such as the melting of glaciers and ice sheets, more extreme temperature ranges, significant changes in weather and a [[Sea level rise|global rise in average sea levels]].&lt;ref name=un20070202/&gt;

[[Cartography]], the study and practice of map-making, and [[geography]], the study of the lands, features, inhabitants and phenomena on Earth, have historically been the disciplines devoted to depicting Earth.

{{Main|Moon}}

The Moon is a relatively large, [[Terrestrial planet|terrestrial]], planet-like [[natural satellite]], with a diameter about one-quarter of Earth's. It is the largest moon in the Solar System relative to the size of its planet, although [[Charon (moon)|Charon]] is larger relative to the [[dwarf planet]] [[Pluto]]. The natural satellites of other planets are also referred to as "moons", after Earth's.

The gravitational attraction between Earth and the Moon causes [[tide]]s on Earth. The same effect on the Moon has led to its [[tidal locking]]: its rotation period is the same as the time it takes to orbit Earth. As a result, it always presents the same face to the planet. As the Moon orbits Earth, different parts of its face are illuminated by the Sun, leading to the [[lunar phase]]s; the dark part of the face is separated from the light part by the [[terminator (solar)|solar terminator]].
[[File:Earth-Moon.svg|thumb|left|Details of the Earth–Moon system, showing the radius of each object and the Earth–Moon [[barycenter]]. The Moon's axis is located by [[Cassini's laws|Cassini's third law]].]]

Due to their [[Tidal acceleration|tidal interaction]], the Moon recedes from Earth at the rate of approximately {{convert|38|mm/yr|in/yr|abbr=on}}. Over millions of years, these tiny modifications—and the lengthening of Earth's day by about 23&amp;nbsp;[[Microsecond|µs]]/yr—add up to significant changes.&lt;ref name=espenak_meeus20070207/&gt; During the [[Devonian]] period, for example, (approximately {{val|410|u=Mya}}) there were 400 days in a year, with each day lasting 21.8 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lambeck |first=Kurt |title=The Earth's Variable Rotation: Geophysical Causes and Consequences |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1980 |page=367 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-kiG3uYkoUEC&amp;pg=PA62 |isbn=978-0-521-67330-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Moon may have dramatically affected the development of life by moderating the planet's climate. [[Paleontology|Paleontological]] evidence and computer simulations show that Earth's axial tilt is stabilized by tidal interactions with the Moon.&lt;ref name=aaa428_261/&gt; Some theorists think that without this stabilization against the [[torque]]s applied by the Sun and planets to Earth's equatorial bulge, the rotational axis might be chaotically unstable, exhibiting chaotic changes over millions of years, as appears to be the case for Mars.&lt;ref name=nature410_6830_773/&gt;

Viewed from Earth, the Moon is just far enough away to have almost the same apparent-sized disk as the Sun. The [[angular size]] (or [[solid angle]]) of these two bodies match because, although the Sun's diameter is about 400 times as large as the Moon's, it is also 400 times more distant.&lt;ref name=angular /&gt; This allows total and annular solar eclipses to occur on Earth.

The most widely accepted theory of the Moon's origin, the [[giant-impact hypothesis]], states that it formed from the collision of a Mars-size protoplanet called Theia with the early Earth. This hypothesis explains (among other things) the Moon's relative lack of iron and volatile elements and the fact that its composition is nearly identical to that of Earth's crust.&lt;ref name=nature412_708/&gt;

==Asteroids and artificial satellites==
[[File:Tracy Caldwell Dyson in Cupola ISS.jpg|thumb|[[Tracy Caldwell Dyson]] viewing Earth from the [[ISS]] Cupola, 2010]]

Over a year, this discrepancy adds up to a full sidereal day.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=solar_energy&gt;Aphelion is 103.4% of the distance to perihelion. Due to the inverse square law, the radiation at perihelion is about 106.9% the energy at aphelion.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=surfacecover&gt;Due to natural fluctuations, ambiguities surrounding [[Ice shelf|ice shelves]], and mapping conventions for [[vertical datum]]s, exact values for land and ocean coverage are not meaningful. Based on data from the [[Vector Map]] and [http://www.landcover.org/ Global Landcover] datasets, extreme values for coverage of lakes and streams are 0.6% and 1.0% of Earth's surface. The ice shields of [[Antarctica]] and [[Greenland]] are counted as land, even though much of the rock that supports them lies below sea level.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=trench_depth&gt;This is the measurement taken by the vessel ''[[Kaikō]]'' in March 1995 and is considered the most accurate measurement to date. See the [[Challenger Deep]] article for more details.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=space_debris&gt;As of 4 January 2018, the United States Strategic Command tracked a total of 18,835 artificial objects, mostly debris.

Received [[radiation]] is unevenly distributed over the planet, because the Sun heats equatorial regions more than polar regions. The atmosphere and ocean work non-stop to even out solar heating imbalances through [[evaporation]] of surface water, convection, rainfall, winds, and ocean circulation. Earth is very close to being in [[radiative equilibrium]], the situation where the incoming solar energy is balanced by an equal flow of heat to space; under that condition, global temperatures will be ''relatively'' stable. Globally, over the course of the year, the Earth system—land surfaces, oceans, and atmosphere—absorbs and then radiates back to space an average of about 240 watts of solar power per square meter. Anything that increases or decreases the amount of incoming or outgoing energy will change global temperatures in response.&lt;ref name="Lindsey 2009"&gt;{{cite journal

However, Earth's energy balance and heat fluxes depend on many factors, such as atmospheric composition (mainly aerosols and greenhouse gases), the [[albedo]] (reflectivity) of surface properties, cloud cover and vegetation and land use patterns.

Changes in surface temperature due to Earth's energy budget do not occur instantaneously, due to the [[inertia]] of the [[ocean]]s and the [[cryosphere]]. The net heat flux is buffered primarily by becoming part of the [[ocean heat content|ocean's heat content]], until a new equilibrium state is established between radiative forcings and the climate response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Energy budget==
[[File:Earth_heat_balance_Sankey_diagram.svg|thumb|250px|left|A [[Sankey diagram]] illustrating the Earth's energy budget described in this section &amp;mdash; line thickness is linearly proportional to relative amount of energy.&lt;ref name="energy_budget" /&gt;]]
In spite of the enormous transfers of energy into and from the Earth, it maintains a relatively constant temperature because, as a whole, there is little net gain or loss: Earth emits via atmospheric and terrestrial radiation (shifted to longer electromagnetic wavelengths) to space about the same amount of energy as it receives via insolation (all forms of electromagnetic radiation).

To quantify Earth's ''heat budget'' or ''heat balance'', let the insolation received at the top of the atmosphere be 100 units (100 units = about 1,360 watts per square meter facing the sun), as shown in the accompanying illustration. Called the [[albedo]] of Earth, around 35 units are reflected back to space: 27 from the top of clouds, 2 from snow and ice-covered areas, and 6 by other parts of the atmosphere. The 65 remaining units are absorbed: 14 within the atmosphere and 51 by the Earth’s surface. These 51 units are radiated to space in the form of terrestrial radiation: 17 directly radiated to space and 34 absorbed by the atmosphere (19 through latent heat of condensation, 9 via convection and turbulence, and 6 directly absorbed). The 48 units absorbed by the atmosphere (34 units from terrestrial radiation and 14 from insolation) are finally radiated back to space. These 65 units (17 from the ground and 48 from the atmosphere) balance the 65 units absorbed from the sun in order to maintain zero net gain of energy by the Earth.&lt;ref name="energy_budget"&gt;

===Incoming radiant energy (shortwave)===

The total amount of energy received per second at the top of [[Earth's atmosphere]] (TOA) is measured in [[watt]]s and is given by the [[solar constant]] times the cross-sectional area of the Earth. Because the surface area of a sphere is four times the cross-sectional surface area of a sphere (i.e. the area of a circle), the average TOA flux is one quarter of the solar constant and so is approximately 340&amp;nbsp;W/m².&lt;ref name="NASA CERES" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Earth's radiation balance and its representation in CMIP5 models|publisher=Copernicus|year=2013|author1=Wild, Martin |author2=Folini, Doris |author3=Schär, Christoph |author4=Loeb, Norman |author5=Dutton, Ellsworth |author6=König-Langlo, Gert |bibcode=2013EGUGA..15.1286W}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the absorption varies with location as well as with diurnal, seasonal and annual variations, the numbers quoted are long-term averages, typically averaged from multiple satellite measurements.&lt;ref name="NASA CERES" /&gt;

Of the ~340&amp;nbsp;W/m² of solar radiation received by the Earth, an average of ~77&amp;nbsp;W/m² is reflected back to space by clouds and the atmosphere and ~23&amp;nbsp;W/m² is reflected by the surface [[albedo]], leaving ~240&amp;nbsp;W/m² of solar energy input to the Earth's energy budget. This gives the earth a mean net albedo of 0.29.&lt;ref name="NASA CERES" /&gt;

===Earth's internal heat and other small effects===
The [[Earth's internal heat budget|geothermal heat flux]] from the Earth's interior is estimated to be 47 [[terawatt]]s.&lt;ref name=Davies&gt;Davies, J. H., &amp; Davies, D. R. (2010). Earth's surface heat flux. Solid Earth, 1(1), 5–24.&lt;/ref&gt; This comes to 0.087&amp;nbsp;watt/square metre, which represents only 0.027% of Earth's total energy budget at the surface, which is dominated by 173,000 terawatts of incoming [[solar radiation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ISBN=978-0-470-94341-0|author=Archer, D.|year=2012|title=Global Warming: Understanding the Forecast}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[World energy consumption|Human production of energy]] is even lower, at an estimated 18 TW.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

[[Photosynthesis]] has a larger effect: [[photosynthetic efficiency]] turns up to 2% of incoming sunlight into [[primary production|biomass]], for a total photosynthetic productivity of earth between ~1500–2250 TW (~1%+/-0.26% solar energy hitting the Earth's surface).&lt;ref name="PLoS"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pisciotta JM, Zou Y, Baskakov IV |title=Light-Dependent Electrogenic Activity of Cyanobacteria |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=5 |issue=5 |pages=e10821 |year=2010 |pmid=20520829 |pmc=2876029 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0010821|bibcode=2010PLoSO...510821P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other minor sources of energy are usually ignored in these calculations, including accretion of [[interplanetary dust]] and [[solar wind]], light from stars other than the Sun and the thermal radiation from space. Earlier, [[Joseph Fourier]] had claimed that deep space radiation was significant in a paper often cited as the first on the [[greenhouse effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=William M. Connolley's page about Fourier 1827: MEMOIRE sur les temperatures du globe terrestre et des espaces planetaires|url=http://www.wmconnolley.org.uk/sci/fourier_1827/|last=Connolley|first=William M.|authorlink=William Connolley|publisher=William M. Connolley|date=18 May 2003|accessdate=5 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Longwave radiation===
{{main|Outgoing longwave radiation}}
Longwave radiation is usually defined as outgoing [[infrared]] energy leaving the planet. However, the atmosphere absorbs parts initially, or cloud cover can reflect radiation. Generally, heat energy is transported between the planet's surface layers (land and ocean) to the atmosphere, transported via [[evapotranspiration]] and [[latent heat]] fluxes or [[thermal conduction|conduction]]/[[convection]] processes.&lt;ref name="NASA CERES" /&gt;  Ultimately, energy is radiated in the form of longwave [[Infrared#Earth as an infrared emitter|infrared radiation]] back into space.

Recent satellite observations indicate additional precipitation, which is sustained by increased energy leaving the surface through evaporation (the latent heat flux), offsetting increases in longwave flux to the surface.&lt;ref name=SatObsEva /&gt;

==Earth's energy imbalance==
If the incoming energy flux is not equal to the outgoing energy flux, net heat is added to or lost by the planet (if the incoming flux is larger or smaller than the outgoing respectively).

===Indirect measurement===
An imbalance must show in something on Earth warming or cooling (depending on the direction of the imbalance), and the ocean being the larger [[thermal reservoir]] on Earth, is a prime candidate for measurements.

Earth's energy imbalance measurements provided by [[Argo (oceanography)|Argo floats]] have detected an accumulation of [[ocean heat content]] (OHC). The estimated imbalance was measured during a deep [[solar minimum]] of 2005–2010 to be 0.58 ± 0.15&amp;nbsp;W/m².&lt;ref name="Imbalance"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=James Hansen |author2=Makiko Sato |author3=Pushker Kharecha |author4=Karina von Schuckmann |publisher=NASA|date=January 2012|url=http://www.giss.nasa.gov/research/briefs/hansen_16/|title=Earth's Energy Imbalance}}&lt;/ref&gt; This level of detail cannot be inferred directly from measurements of surface energy fluxes, which have combined uncertainties of the order of ± 17&amp;nbsp;W/m².&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = An update on Earth's energy balance in light of the latest global observations|url = http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v5/n10/full/ngeo1580.html|journal = Nature Geoscience|date = 2012-10-01|issn = 1752-0894|pages = 691–696|volume = 5|issue = 10|doi = 10.1038/ngeo1580|first = Graeme L.|last = Stephens|first2 = Juilin|last2 = Li|first3 = Martin|last3 = Wild|first4 = Carol Anne|last4 = Clayson|first5 = Norman|last5 = Loeb|first6 = Seiji|last6 = Kato|first7 = Tristan|last7 = L'Ecuyer|first8 = Paul W. |last8 = Stackhouse Jr.|first9 = Matthew|last9 = Lebsock|bibcode = 2012NatGe...5..691S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Direct measurement ===
Several [[satellite]]s indirectly measure the energy absorbed and radiated by Earth and by inference the energy imbalance. The [[NASA]] [[Earth Radiation Budget Satellite|Earth Radiation Budget Experiment]] (ERBE) project involves three such satellites: the [[Earth Radiation Budget Satellite]] (ERBS), launched October 1984; NOAA-9, launched December 1984; and NOAA-10, launched September 1986.&lt;ref&gt;[http://icp.giss.nasa.gov/education/radforce/ Effect of the Sun's Energy on the Ocean and Atmosphere (1997)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Today NASA's satellite instruments, provided by CERES, part of the NASA's [[Earth Observing System]] (EOS), are designed to measure both solar-reflected and Earth-emitted radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= B.A. Wielicki |display-authors=etal |title=Mission to Planet Earth: Role of Clouds and Radiation in Climate |journal=Bull.

{{See also|Greenhouse effect}}
The major [[atmosphere of Earth|atmospheric]] gases ([[oxygen]] and [[nitrogen]]) are transparent to incoming sunlight but are also transparent to outgoing thermal ([[infrared]]) radiation. However, [[water vapor#Water vapor in Earth.27s atmosphere|water vapor]], [[carbon dioxide]], [[methane]] and other trace gases are opaque to many [[wavelength]]s of thermal radiation. The Earth's surface radiates the net equivalent of 17 percent of the incoming [[solar radiation|solar energy]] in the form of thermal infrared. However, the amount that directly escapes to space is only about 12 percent of incoming solar energy. The remaining fraction, 5 to 6 percent, is absorbed by the atmosphere by [[greenhouse gas]] [[molecule]]s.&lt;ref name="lindsey greenhouse effect p6"&gt;Edited quote from public-domain source: {{citation

The absorption patterns of water vapor (blue peaks) and carbon dioxide (pink peaks) overlap in some wavelengths. Carbon dioxide is not as strong a greenhouse gas as water vapor, but it absorbs energy in wavelengths (12–15 micrometres) that water vapor does not, partially closing the "window" through which heat radiated by the surface would normally escape to space. (Illustration NASA, Robert Rohde)&lt;ref name="NASA climate forcings"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/EnergyBalance/page7.php|title=NASA: Climate Forcings and Global Warming|date=January 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
When greenhouse gas molecules absorb thermal infrared energy, their temperature rises. Those gases then radiate an increased amount of thermal infrared energy in all directions. Heat radiated upward continues to encounter greenhouse gas molecules; those molecules also absorb the heat, and their temperature rises and the amount of heat they radiate increases. The atmosphere thins with [[altitude]], and at roughly 5–6&amp;nbsp;[[kilometre]]s, the concentration of greenhouse gases in the overlying atmosphere is so thin that heat can escape to space.&lt;ref name="lindsey greenhouse effect p6"/&gt;

Because greenhouse gas molecules radiate infrared energy in all directions, some of it spreads downward and ultimately returns to the Earth's surface, where it is absorbed. The Earth's surface temperature is thus higher than it would be if it were heated only by direct solar heating. This supplemental heating is the natural greenhouse effect.&lt;ref name="lindsey greenhouse effect p6"/&gt; It is as if the Earth is covered by a blanket that allows high frequency radiation (sunlight) to enter, but slows the rate at which the low frequency infrared radiant energy emitted by the Earth leaves.

==Climate sensitivity==
{{Main|Radiative forcing}}
A change in the incident radiated portion of the energy budget is referred to as a [[radiative forcing]].

[[Climate sensitivity]] is the [[steady state]] change in the equilibrium temperature as a result of changes in the energy budget.

===Climate forcings and global warming===
[[File:NASA Hansen Aerosol effect on expected energy imbalance Earth budget.gif|right|300px|thumb|Expected Earth energy imbalance for three choices of aerosol climate forcing. Measured imbalance, close to 0.6 W/m², implies that aerosol forcing is close to −1.6 W/m². (Credit: NASA/GISS)&lt;ref name="Imbalance" /&gt;]]
Climate forcings are changes that cause temperatures to rise or fall, disrupting the energy balance. Natural climate forcings include changes in the Sun's brightness, [[Milankovitch cycles]] (small variations in the shape of Earth's orbit and its axis of rotation that occur over thousands of years) and volcanic eruptions that inject light-reflecting particles as high as the [[stratosphere]]. Man-made forcings include particle pollution ([[aerosols]]) that absorb and reflect incoming sunlight; [[deforestation]], which changes how the surface reflects and absorbs sunlight; and the rising concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, which decreases the rate at which heat is radiated to space.

A forcing can trigger [[feedback]]s that intensify ([[positive feedback]]) or weaken ([[negative feedback]]) the original forcing. For example, [[Arctic sea ice decline|loss of ice]] at the poles, which makes them less reflective, causes greater absorption of energy and so increases the rate at which the ice melts, is an example of a positive feedback.&lt;ref name="NASA climate forcings" /&gt;

The observed planetary energy imbalance during the [[solar cycle 24|recent solar minimum]] shows that solar forcing of climate, although natural and significant, is overwhelmed by anthropogenic climate forcing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.giss.nasa.gov/research/briefs/hansen_16/|title=NASA GISS: Science Brief: Earth's Energy Imbalance|website=www.giss.nasa.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, [[NASA]] scientists reported that to stop [[global warming]] atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; content would have to be reduced to 350&amp;nbsp;ppm or less, assuming all other climate forcings were fixed. The impact of anthropogenic [[aerosols]] has not been quantified, but individual aerosol types are thought to have substantial heating and cooling effects.&lt;ref name="Imbalance" /&gt;

'''Ecosystem health''' is a metaphor used to describe the condition of an [[ecosystem]].&lt;ref name=rapport1998&gt;Rapport, David (1998). "Defining ecosystem health." Pages 18-33 in Rapport, D.J. (ed.) (1998). ''Ecosystem Health.'' Blackwell Scientific.&lt;/ref&gt; Ecosystem condition can vary as a result of fire, [[flooding]], [[drought]], [[extinction]]s, [[invasive species]], [[climate change]], [[mining]], [[overexploitation]] in [[fishing]], [[farming]] or [[logging]], [[chemical spill]]s, and a host of other reasons. There is no universally accepted benchmark for a healthy ecosystem,&lt;ref&gt;Rapport, David J. (1992). "Evaluating ecosystem health." ''Journal of aquatic ecosystem health'' 1:15-24&lt;/ref&gt; rather the apparent health status of an ecosystem can vary depending upon which health metrics are employed in judging it&lt;ref name=palmer2012&gt;Palmer, Margaret A. and Catherine M. Febria (2012). "The heartbeat of ecosystems." ''Science'' 336:1393-1394.&lt;/ref&gt; and which societal aspirations are driving the assessment. Advocates of the health metaphor argue for its simplicity as a communication tool. "Policy-makers and the public need simple, understandable concepts like health."&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, Judy L. (1997). "Stream health: incorporating the human dimension to advance stream ecology." ''Journal of the North American Benthological Society'' 16:439^447&lt;/ref&gt; Critics worry that ecosystem health, a "value-laden construct", is often "passed off as science to unsuspecting policy makers and the public."&lt;ref&gt;Lackey, Robert T. (2007). "Science, scientists, and policy advocacy." ''Conservation Biology.'' 21(1): 12-17.&lt;/ref&gt;
== History of the concept ==

The health metaphor applied to the environment has been in use at least since the early 1800s&lt;ref&gt;Anon (1816). "Rural economy, agricultur
" ''[[Encyclopaedia Perthensis]]'' Volume 19, 391-497. Edinburgh: John Brown.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anon (1839). "On the culture of potatoes". ''Framer's Magazine, '' 2(5):337-338.&lt;/ref&gt; and the great American conservationist [[Aldo Leopold]] (1887–1948) spoke metaphorically of land health, land sickness, mutilation, and violence when describing land use practices.&lt;ref&gt;Leopold, Aldo (1946). "The land health concept and conservation." Pages 218-226 in Callicott, J. Baird, and Eric T.Freyfogle. (1999) ''For the Health of the Land. '' Washington DC: Island Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "ecosystem management" has been in use at least since the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Lutz, H.J. (1957). "Applications of ecology in forest management." ''Ecology'' 38:46-64.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "ecosystem health" has become widespread in the ecological literature, as a general metaphor meaning something good,&lt;ref name=Jax2010&gt;Jax, Kurt. (2010). ''Ecosystem Functioning.'' Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; and as an environmental quality goal in field assessments of rivers,&lt;ref&gt;Davies, P.E. et al. (2010). "The Sustainable Rivers Audit: assessing river ecosystem health in the Murray–Darling Basin, Australia." ''Marine and Freshwater Research'' 61:764–777.&lt;/ref&gt; lakes,&lt;ref&gt;Xu, F, ZF Yang, B. Chen, and Y.W. Zhao. (2012). "Ecosystem Health Assessment of Baiyangdian Lake Based on Thermodynamic Indicators." ''Procedia Environmental Sciences'' 12: 2402–2413.&lt;/ref&gt; seas,&lt;ref&gt;HELCOM  (2010). ''Ecosystem health of the Baltic Sea 2003–2007'' HELCOM Initial Holistic Assessment.Balt. Sea Environ.

''Journal of Forestry'' 95:23-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently however this metaphor has been subject of quantitative formulation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ramírez-Carrillo|first=Elvia|last2=López-Corona|first2=Oliver|last3=Toledo-Roy|first3=Juan C.|last4=Lovett|first4=Jon C.|last5=León-González|first5=Fernando de|last6=Osorio-Olvera|first6=Luis|last7=Equihua|first7=Julian|last8=Robredo|first8=Everardo|last9=Frank|first9=Alejandro|date=2018-07-16|title=Assessing sustainability in North America’s ecosystems using criticality and information theory|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0200382|journal=PLOS ONE|language=en|volume=13|issue=7|pages=e0200382|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0200382|issn=1932-6203}}&lt;/ref&gt; using complex systems concepts such as criticality, meaning that a healthy ecosystem is in some sort of balance between adaptability (randomness) and robustness (order) . Nevertheless the universality of criticality is still under examination and is known as the Criticality Hypothesis, which states that systems in a dynamic regime shifting between order and disorder, attain the highest level of computational capabilities and achieve an optimal trade-off between robustness and flexibility. Recent results in cell and evolutionary biology, neuroscience and computer science have great interest in the criticality hypothesis, emphasizing its role as a viable candidate general law in the realm of adaptive complex systems (see &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roli|first=Andrea|last2=Villani|first2=Marco|last3=Filisetti|first3=Alessandro|last4=Serra|first4=Roberto|date=2017-11-17|title=Dynamical Criticality: Overview and Open Questions|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11424-017-6117-5|journal=Journal of Systems Science and Complexity|volume=31|issue=3|pages=647–663|doi=10.1007/s11424-017-6117-5|issn=1009-6124}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and references therein).

== Meaning ==

The term ecosystem health has been employed to embrace some suite of environmental goals deemed desirable.&lt;ref&gt;Slocombe, D. Scott (1998). "Defining Goals and Criteria for Ecosystem-Based Management." ''Environmental Management'' 22:483–493&lt;/ref&gt; Edward Grumbine's highly cited paper&lt;ref name=grumbine1994&gt;Grumbine, R. Edward (1994). "What is ecosystem management?" ''Conservation Biology'' 8:27-38&lt;/ref&gt; "What is ecosystem management?" surveyed ecosystem management and ecosystem health literature and summarized frequently encountered goal statements:
* Conserving [[viable population]]s of [[native species]]
* Conserving [[ecosystem diversity]]
* Maintaining evolutionary and ecological processes
* Managing over long time frames to maintain evolutionary potential
* Accommodating human use and occupancy within these constraints

Grumbine describes each of these goals as a "value statement" and stresses the role of human [[values]] in setting ecosystem management goals.

It is the last goal mentioned in the survey, accommodating humans, that is most contentious. "We have observed that when groups of stakeholders work to define … visions, this leads to debate over whether to emphasize ecosystem health or human well-being … Whether the priority is ecosystems or people greatly influences stakeholders' assessment of desirable ecological and social states."&lt;ref&gt;Leslie, heather M. and Karen L. McLeod (2007). "Confronting the challenges of implementing marine ecosystem-based management." ''Frontiers of Ecology and the Environment'' 5:540-548.&lt;/ref&gt; and, for example, "For some, [[wolves]] are critical to ecosystem health and an essential part of nature, for others they are a symbol of government overreach threatening their livelihoods and cultural values."&lt;ref&gt;Myers, Andrew (2015). Which wolf, which trap? Socially constructing wolves and trapping in western Montana. ''Scholar Works'', University of Montana, Oral Presentations.&lt;/ref&gt;

Measuring ecosystem health requires extensive goal-driven environmental sampling. For example, a vision for ecosystem health of [[Lake Superior]] was developed by a public forum and a series of objectives were prepared for [[habitat protection|protection of habitat]] and maintenance of populations of some 70 indigenous fish species.&lt;ref name=horns2003&gt;Horns, W.H., et al. (2003). '' Fish-community objectives for Lake Superior. '' Great Lakes Fish. Commission Special Publication. 03-01. 78 pages.&lt;/ref&gt; A suite of 80 lake health indicators was developed for the Great Lakes Basin including monitoring native fish species, exotic species, water levels, phosphorus levels, toxic chemicals, [[phytoplankton]], [[zooplankton]], fish tissue contaminants, etc.&lt;ref name=Shear2003&gt;Shear, Harvey et al. (2003). "The development and implementation of indicators of ecosystem health in the Great Lakes Basin." ''Journal of Environmental Monitoring and Assessment'' 88:119–152&lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors have attempted broad definitions of ecosystem health, such as benchmarking as healthy the historical ecosystem state "prior to the onset of [[anthropocene|anthropogenic stress]]."&lt;ref name=rapport2011&gt;Rapport, David J. and • Luisa Maffi  (2011). "Eco-cultural health, global health, and sustainability." ''Ecological Research'' 26:1039-1049&lt;/ref&gt; A difficulty is that the historical composition of many human-altered ecosystems is unknown or unknowable. Also, [[fossil record|fossil]] and [[pollen]] records indicate that the species that occupy an ecosystem [[ecologic succession|reshuffle]] through time, so it is difficult to identify one snapshot in time as optimum or "healthy.".&lt;ref name=wicklum1995&gt;Wicklum, D. and Ronald W. Davies (1995). "Ecosystem health and integrity?" ''Canadian Journal of Botany'' 73:997-1000.&lt;/ref&gt;

A commonly cited broad definition states that a healthy ecosystem has three attributes:
# [[Productivity (ecology)|productivity]],
# [[resilience (ecology)|resilience]], and
# "organization" (including [[biodiversity]]).&lt;ref name=rapport2011 /&gt;

While this captures significant ecosystem properties, a generalization is elusive as those properties do not necessarily co-vary in nature. For example, there is not necessarily a clear or consistent relationship between productivity and species richness.&lt;ref&gt;Adler, Peter et al. (2011). "Productivity is a poor predictor of plant species richness." ''Science'' 333:1750-1752.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the relationship between  [[System resilience|resilience]] and diversity is complex, and [[ecosystem stability]] may depend upon one or a few species rather than overall diversity.&lt;ref&gt;Ives, Anthony R. and Stephen R. Carpenter (2007). "Stability and Diversity of Ecosystems." ''Science'' 317:58-62.&lt;/ref&gt; And some undesirable ecosystems are highly productive.&lt;ref&gt;Asanova, Umut (2002). "Philosophy of ecological ethics education, considering the Issyk-Kul Lake reediation mechanisms." Jean Klerkx and Beishen Imanakanov (2002). Lake Issk-Kul: Its natural Environment Springer Science&lt;/ref&gt;

"Resilience is not desirable per se. There can be highly resilient states of ecosystems which are very undesirable from some human perspectives , such as algal-dominated [[coral reef]]s."&lt;ref name=Jax2010 /&gt; Ecological [[resilience (ecology)|resilience]] is a "capacity" that varies depending upon which properties of the ecosystem are to be studied and depending upon what kinds of disturbances are considered and how they are to be quantified.  Approaches to assessing it "face high uncertainties and still require a considerable amount of empirical and theoretical research."&lt;ref name=Jax2010 /&gt;

Other authors have sought a numerical index of ecosystem health that would permit quantitative comparisons among ecosystems and within ecosystems over time.  One such system employs ratings of the three properties mentioned above: Health = system vigor x system organization x [[system resilience]].&lt;ref&gt;Costanza, R. 1992. "Toward an operational definition of ecosystem health." Pp 239-256 in Costanza, R., B. Norton, and B. Haskell. ''Ecosystem health. New Goals for Environmental Management. '' Washington DC: Island Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Ecologist Glenn Suter argues that such indices employ "nonsense units," the indices have "no meaning; they cannot be predicted, so they are not applicable to most regulatory problems; they have no diagnostic power; effects of one component are eclipsed by responses of other components, and the reason for a high or low index value is unknown."&lt;ref name=suter1993&gt;Suter, Glenn W. (1993). "A critique of ecosystem health concepts and indexes." ''Environmental toxicology and chemistry'' 12:1533-1539.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health indicators ==

Health [[Performance metric|metrics]] are determined by stakeholder goals, which drive ecosystem definition. An ecosystem is an abstraction.&lt;ref&gt;Jax, Kurt (2007). "Can we define ecosystems? On the confusion between definition and description of ecological concepts." ''Acta Biotheor'' 55:341–355&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Oneill2001&gt;O'Neill, Robert V. (2001). "Is it time to bury the ecosystem concept? (with full military honors, of course!)" ''Ecology'' 82:3275–3284&lt;/ref&gt;  "Ecosystems cannot be identified or found in nature. Instead, they must be delimited by an observer. This can be done in many different ways for the same chunk of nature, depending on the specific perspectives of interest."&lt;ref name=Jax2010 /&gt;

Ecosystem definition determines the acceptable range of variability (reference conditions) and determines measurement variables. The latter are used as indicators of ecosystem structure and function, and can be used as indicators of "health".

An [[Environmental indicator|indicator]] is a variable, such as a chemical or biological property, that when measured, is used to infer trends in another (unmeasured) environmental variable or cluster of unmeasured variables (the indicandum). For example, rising [[mortality rate]] of canaries in a coal mine is an indicator of rising [[carbon monoxide]] levels. Rising [[chlorophyll-a]] levels in a lake may signal [[eutrophication]].&lt;ref&gt;Wright, David A. and Pamela Welbourne (2002) ''Environmental Toxicology''. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ecosystem assessments employ two kinds of indicators, descriptive indicators and normative indicators. "Indicators can be used descriptively for a scientific purpose or normatively for a political purpose."&lt;ref name=heink2010&gt;Heink, Ulrich and Ingo Kowarik (2010) "What are indicators? On the definition of indicators in ecology and environmental planning." ''Ecological Indicators'' 10:584–593&lt;/ref&gt;

Used descriptively, high chlorophyll-a is an indicator of eutrophication, but it may also be used as an ecosystem health indicator. When used as a normative (health) indicator, it indicates a rank on a health scale, a rank that can vary widely depending on societal preferences as to what is desirable. A high chlorophyll-a level in a natural [[ecological succession|successional]] [[wetland]] might be viewed as healthy whereas a human-impacted wetland with the ''same'' indicator value may be judged unhealthy.&lt;ref&gt;Costanza,  Robert, and Michael Mageau (1999). "What is a healthy ecosystem?" ''Aquatic Ecology'' 33: 105–115&lt;/ref&gt;

Estimation of ecosystem health has been criticized for intermingling the two types of environmental indicators.&lt;ref name=heink2010 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carolan, Michael (2006). "The values and vulnerabilities of metaphors within the environmental sciences." ''Society and Natural Resources'' 19:921–930&lt;/ref&gt; A health indicator is a normative indicator, and if conflated with descriptive indicators "implies that normative values can be measured objectively, which is certainly not true. Thus, implicit values are insinuated to the reader, a situation which has to be avoided."&lt;ref name=heink2010 /&gt;

It can be argued that the very act of selecting indicators of any kind is [[bias]]ed by the observer's perspective&lt;ref&gt;Jax, Kurt (2005). "Function and 'functioning' in ecology: what does it mean?" ''Oikos'' 111:3&lt;/ref&gt; but separation of goals from descriptions has been advocated as a step toward transparency:  "A separation of descriptive and normative indicators is essential from the perspective of the philosophy of science … Goals and values cannot be deduced directly from descriptions … a fact that is emphasized repeatedly in the literature of environmental ethics … Hence, we advise always specifying the definition of indicators and propose clearly distinguishing ecological indicators in science from policy indicators used for decision-making processes."&lt;ref name=heink2010 /&gt;

And integration of multiple, possibly conflicting, normative indicators into a single measure of "ecosystem health" is problematic. Using 56 indicators, "determining environmental status and assessing [[marine ecosystem]]s health in an integrative way is still one of the grand challenges in marine ecosystems ecology, research and management"&lt;ref&gt;Borja A, et al. (2014). "Tales from a thousand and one ways to integrate marine ecosystem components when assessing the environmental status." ''Frontiers in Marine Science''. 1:72&lt;/ref&gt;

Another issue with indicators is validity. Good indicators must have an independently validated high [[Predictive value of tests|predictive value]], that is high [[sensitivity (control systems)|sensitivity]] (high probability of indicating a significant change in the indicandum) and high [[specificity (statistics)|specificity]] (low probability of wrongly indicating a change). The reliability of various health metrics has been questioned&lt;ref&gt;Woodward, Guy, et al. (2012). Continental-wide effects of nutrient pollution on stream ecosystem functioning. ''Science'', 336:1448-1440.&lt;/ref&gt; and "what combination of measurements should be used to evaluate ecosystems is a matter of current scientific debate."&lt;ref name=palmer2012&gt;Palmer, Margaret A. and Catherine M. Febria (2012). "The heartbeat of ecosystems." ''Science'' 336:1393-1394.&lt;/ref&gt; Most attempts to identify ecological indicators have been [[correlation|correlative]] rather than derived from prospective testing of their predictive value&lt;ref&gt;Barton, Philip S. et al. (2015). "Learning from clinical medicine to improve the use of surrogates in ecology." ''Oikos'' 124:391-398.&lt;/ref&gt; and the selection process for many indicators has been based upon weak evidence or has been lacking in evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed A.H. et al. (2016). "How do ecologists select and use indicator species to monitor ecological change? Insights from 14 years of publication in ''Ecological Indicators''." ''Ecological Indicator''s 60:223-230.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases no reliable indicators are known: "We found no examples of [[invertebrates]] successfully used in [forest] monitoring programs. Their richness and abundance ensure that they play significant roles in ecosystem function but thwart focus on a few key species." And, "Reviews of species-based monitoring approaches reveal that no single species, nor even a group of species, accurately reflects entire communities. Understanding the response of a single species may not provide reliable predictions about a group of species even when the group is {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} a few very similar species."&lt;ref&gt;Kremsater, Laurie L. and Fred L. Bunnell (2009). "Sustaining forest-dwelling species." Pages 173-218 in Bunnell, Fred L. and Glen B. Dunsworth (2009). ''Forestry and Biodiversity''. Learning how to Sustain Biodiversity in Managed Forests. UBC Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship to human health: the health paradox ==

A trade-off between human health and the "health" of nature has been termed the "health paradox"&lt;ref&gt;C. Max Finlayson and Pierre Horwitz (2015). "Wetlands as settings for human health – the benefits and the paradox."  Pages 1-13 in Finlayson, C.M. et al. 2015. ''Wetlands and Human Health''. Springer&lt;/ref&gt; and it illuminates how human values drive perceptions of ecosystem health.

Human health has benefited by sacrificing the "health" of wild ecosystems, such as dismantling and [[dam]]ming of wild valleys, destruction of [[mosquito]]-bearing [[wetlands]], diversion of water for [[irrigation]], conversion of wilderness to [[farmland]], [[timber]] removal, and [[Local extinction|extirpation]] of [[tiger]]s, whales, ferrets, and [[wolves]].

There has been an acrimonious schism among [[conservation movement|conservationists]] and resource managers&lt;ref&gt;Tallis, Heather and  &amp; Jane Lubchenco  (2014) "Working together: A call for inclusive conservation." ''Nature'' 515, 27–28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tudela, Sergi and Katherine Short (2005). "Paradigm shifts, gaps, inertia, and political agendas in ecosystem-based fisheries management." ''Marine Ecology Progress Series'' 300:282-286.&lt;/ref&gt; over the question of whether to "ratchet back human domination of the biosphere" or whether to embrace it.&lt;ref&gt;Noss, Redd et al. (2013). "Humanity's domination of nature is part of the problem: a response to Kareiva and Marvier." ''BioScience'' 63:241-242&lt;/ref&gt; These two perspectives have been characterized as utilitarian vs protectionist.&lt;ref&gt;Nijhius, Michelle (2014). "Bridging the conservation divide."  New Yorker, December 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[utilitarian]] view treats [[human health]] and [[well-being]] as criteria of ecosystem health.&lt;ref&gt;Su, Meirong et al. (2010)."Urban ecosystem health assessment: A review." ''Science of the Total Environment'' 408:2425–2434&lt;/ref&gt; For example, destruction of wetlands to control malaria mosquitoes "resulted in an improvement in ecosystem health."&lt;ref&gt;Rapport, David J. (1998). "Some distinctions worth making." ''Ecosystem Health'' 4:193-194.&lt;/ref&gt;
The protectionist view treats humans as an invasive species: "If there was ever a species that qualified as an invasive pest, it is ''Homo sapiens'',"&lt;ref name=Oneill2001 /&gt;

Proponents of the utilitarian view argue that "healthy ecosystems are characterized by their capability to sustain healthy human populations,"&lt;ref name=rapport1998 /&gt; and "healthy ecosystems must be economically viable," as it is "unhealthy" ecosystems that are likely to result in increases in [[contamination]], [[infectious disease]]s, fires, floods, [[crop failure]]s and fishery collapse.&lt;ref&gt;Rapport, David (1998). "Dimensions of ecosystem health." Pages 34-40 in Rapport, D.J. (ed.) (1998). ''Ecosystem Health''. Blackwell Scientific.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Protectionist]]s argue that privileging of human health is a [[conflict of interest]] as humans have [[ecosystem destruction|demolished]] massive numbers of ecosystems to maintain their welfare, also disease and [[parasitism]] are historically normal in pre-industrial nature.&lt;ref name=wilkins1999&gt;Wilkins, D.A. (1999). "Assessing ecosystem health."  ''Trends in Ecology and Evolution'' 14:70&lt;/ref&gt; Diseases and parasites promote ecosystem functioning, driving biodiversity and productivity,&lt;ref&gt;Hudson, Peter J., Andrew P. Dobson and Kevin D. Lafferty (2006). "Is a healthy ecosystem one that is rich in parasites?" ''Trends in Ecology and Evolution'' 21:381-385.&lt;/ref&gt; and parasites may constitute a significant fraction of ecosystem biomass.&lt;ref&gt;Kuris, Armand M. et al. (2008). "Ecosystem energetic implications of parasite and free-living biomass in three estuaries." ''Nature'' 454:515-518.&lt;/ref&gt;

The very choice of the word "health" applied to ecology has been questioned as lacking in neutrality in a BioScience article on responsible use of scientific language: "Some conservationists fear that these terms could endorse human domination of the planet … and could exacerbate the shifting cognitive baseline whereby humans tend to become accustomed to new and often degraded ecosystems and thus forget the nature of the past."&lt;ref&gt;Kueffer, Christoph and Brendon M. H. Larson (2014). "Responsible Use of Language in Scientific Writing and Science Communication." ''BioScience'' 64(8): 719–724.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism of the concept and proposed alternatives ==

Criticism of ecosystem health largely targets the failure of proponents to explicitly distinguish the normative dimension from the descriptive dimension, and has included the following:
* Ecosystem health is in the eye of the beholder. It is an economic, political or ethical judgement rather than a scientific measure of environmental quality. Health ratings are shaped by the goals and preferences of environmental stakeholders.&lt;ref name=lancaster2000&gt;Lancaster, Jill (2000). "The Ridiculous Notion of Assessing Ecological Health and Identifying the Useful Concepts Underneath."''Human and Ecological Risk Assessment'' 6: 213-222&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carolan, Michael S. (2006). "Science, Expertise, and the Democratization of the Decision-Making Process." ''Society and Natural Resources'' 19:661–668&lt;/ref&gt; "At the core of debates over the utility of ecosystem health is a struggle over which societal preferences will take precedence."&lt;ref name=lackey2003&gt;Lackey, Robert T. (2003). "Appropriate use of ecosystem health and normative science in ecological policy" Pages. 175-186 in: Rapport, David J. et al. (2003)  ''Managing for Healthy Ecosystems ''  Boca Raton, Florida: Lewis Publishers, , 1510 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Health is a metaphor, not a property of an ecosystem. Health is an abstraction. It implies "good", an optimum condition, but in nature ecosystems are ever-changing transitory assemblages with no identifiable optimum.&lt;ref name=wicklum1995 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Calow, P. (1992)." Can ecosystems be healthy? Critical consideration of concepts." ''Journal of Aquatic Ecosystem Health'' 1:1-5.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Use of human health and well-being as a criterion of ecosystem health introduces an arrogance and a conflict of interest into environmental assessment, as human population growth has caused much [[environmental damage]].&lt;ref name=wilkins1999 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stanley, Thomas R. Jr. (1995). "Ecosystem management and the arrogance of humanism." ''Conservation Biology'' 9:255-262&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ecosystem health masquerades as an operational goal because environmental managers "may be reluctant to define their goals clearly."&lt;ref name=lackey2001 /&gt;
* It is a vague concept.&lt;ref name=Jax2010 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Duarte, Carlos M. et al. (2015). "Paradigms in the recovery of estuarine and coastal ecosystems." ''Estuaries and Coasts'' 38:1202-1212&lt;/ref&gt; "Currently there are many, often contradictory, definitions of ecosystem health,"&lt;ref name=lackey2001&gt;Lackey, Robert T. (2001). "Values, Policy, and Ecosystem Health." ''BioScience'' 51(6):437-443&lt;/ref&gt; that "are open to so much abuse and misuse that they represent a threat to the environment."&lt;ref name=lancaster2000 /&gt;
* "There are in general no clear definitions of what proponents of the concept mean by 'ecosystem'."&lt;ref name=Jax2010 /&gt;
* The public can be deceived by the term ecosystem health which may camouflage the ramifications of a policy goal and be employed to pejoratively rank policy choices.&lt;ref name=lackey2001 /&gt; "The most pervasive misuse of ecosystem health and similar normative notions is insertion of personal values under the guise of 'scientific' impartiality."&lt;ref name=lackey2003 /&gt;

Alternatives have been proposed for the term ecosystem health, including more neutral language such as ecosystem status,&lt;ref&gt;Link, Jason S. (2002) "What Does Ecosystem-Based Fisheries Management Mean?" ''Fisheries'' 27:18-21&lt;/ref&gt; ecosystem prognosis, and ecosystem sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;Schrecker, Ted (1995) Synthesis of Discussion.pp 118-125 in  Hodge, Tony et al. ''Pathways to Sustainability: Assessing Our Progress''. Ottawa: National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy.&lt;/ref&gt; Another alternative to the use of a health metaphor is  to "express exactly and clearly the public policy and the management objective", to employ habitat descriptors and real properties of ecosystems.&lt;ref name=suter1993 /&gt;&lt;ref name=lancaster2000 /&gt;&lt;ref name=lackey2001 /&gt; An example of a policy statement is "The maintenance of viable natural populations of wildlife and ecological functions always takes precedence over any human use of wildlife."&lt;ref&gt;Anon (1995). ''Wildlife policy for Prince Edward Island. Government of Prince Edward Island'', 18 pages.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a goal is "Maintain viable populations of all native species in situ."&lt;ref name=grumbine1994 /&gt; An example of a management objective is "Maintain self-sustaining populations of lake whitefish within the range of abundance observed during 1990-99."&lt;ref name=horns2003 /&gt;

Kurt Jax&lt;ref name=Jax2010 /&gt; presented an ecosystem assessment format that avoids imposing a preconceived notion of normality, that avoids the muddling of normative and descriptive, and that gives serious attention to ecosystem definition. (1) Societal purposes for the ecosystem are negotiated by stakeholders, (2) a functioning ecosystem is defined with emphasis on phenomena relevant to stakeholder goals, (3) benchmark reference conditions and permissible variation of the system are established, (4) measurement variables are chosen for use as indicators, and (5) the time scale and spatial scale of assessment are decided.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10327">'''Electroacoustic phenomena''' arise when [[ultrasound]] propagates through a [[fluid]] containing [[ions]]. The associated particle motion generates [[electric]] signals because ions have [[electric charge]]. This coupling between ultrasound and [[electric field]] is called electroacoustic phenomena. The fluid might be a simple [[Newtonian liquid]], or complex [[heterogeneous]] [[Dispersion (chemistry)|dispersion]], [[emulsion]] or even a porous body. There are several different electroacoustic effects depending on the nature of the fluid.

*[[Ion vibration current]] (IVI) and potential, an [[electric]] signal that arises when an [[acoustic wave]] propagates through a [[Homogeneous (chemistry)|homogeneous]] fluid.
*[[Streaming vibration current]] (SVI) and potential, an electric signal that arises when an acoustic wave propagates through a porous body in which the pores are filled with fluid.
*[[Colloid vibration current]] (CVI) and potential, an electric signal that arises when ultrasound propagates through a [[heterogeneous]] fluid, such as a [[Dispersion (chemistry)|dispersion]] or [[emulsion]].
*[[Electric sonic amplitude]] (ESA), the inverse of the CVI effect, in which an acoustic field arises when an [[electric field]] propagates through a [[heterogeneous]] fluid.

==Ion vibration current==
{{main|Ion vibration current}}
Historically, the IVI was the first known electroacoustic effect. It was predicted by Debye in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;Debye.P."A method for the determination of the mass of electrolyte ions"J. Chem. Phys., 1,13-16,1933&lt;/ref&gt;

==Streaming vibration current==
{{main|Streaming vibration current}}
The streaming vibration current was experimentally observed in 1948 by Williams.&lt;ref&gt;Williams.M. " An Electrokinetic Transducer" The review of scientific instruments, 19, 10, 640-646, 1948&lt;/ref&gt; A theoretical model was developed some 30 years later by Dukhin and others.&lt;ref&gt;Dukhin, S.S., Mischuk, N.A., Kuz'menko, B.B and Il'in, B.I. "Flow current and potential in a high-frequency acoustic field" Colloid J., 45, 5, 875-881,1983&lt;/ref&gt; This effect opens another possibility for characterizing the electric properties of the surfaces in porous bodies. A similar effect can be observed at a non-porous surface, when sound is bounced off at an oblique angle. The incident and reflected waves superimpose to cause oscillatory fluid motion in the plane of the interface, thereby generating an AC streaming current at the frequency of the sound waves.&lt;ref&gt;Glauser, A.R., Robertson P.A., Lowe, C.R., "An electrokinetic sensor for studying immersed surfaces, using focused ultrasound" Sensors Actuators B, 80, 1, 68-82, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

==Double layer compression==
The [[electrical double layer]] can be regarded as behaving like a parallel plate capacitor with a compressible dielectric filling. When sound waves induce a local pressure variation, the spacing of the plates varies at the frequency of the excitation, generating an AC displacement current normal to the interface. For practical reasons this is most readily observed at a conducting surface.&lt;ref&gt;F.I. Kukoz, L.A. Kukoz, "The nature of audioelectro-chemical phenomena" Russ. J. Phys. Chem. 36 (1962) pp. 367-369&lt;/ref&gt; It is therefore possible to use an electrode immersed in a conducting electrolyte as a microphone, or indeed as a loudspeaker when the effect is applied in reverse.&lt;ref&gt;N. Tankovsky, "Capacitive ultrasound transducer, based on the electrical double layer in electrolytes" J. App. Phys. 87 (2000) pp. 538-542&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colloid vibration potential and current==
{{main|Colloid vibration current}}
Colloid vibration potential measures the AC potential difference generated between two identical relaxed electrodes, placed in the dispersion, if the latter is subjected to an ultrasonic field. When a sound wave travels through a colloidal suspension of particles whose density differs from that of the surrounding medium, inertial forces induced by the vibration of the suspension give rise to a motion of the charged particles relative to the liquid, causing an alternating electromotive force. The manifestations of this electromotive force may be measured, depending on the relation between the impedance of the suspension and that of the measuring instrument, either as colloid vibration potential or as ''colloid vibration current''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Colloid vibration potential and current was first reported by Hermans and then independently by Rutgers in 1938. It is widely used for characterizing the ζ-potential of various dispersions and emulsions. The effect, theory, experimental verification and multiple applications are discussed in the book by Dukhin and Goetz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dukhin |first=A.S. |authorlink= |author2=Goetz, P.J. |title=Ultrasound for Characterizing Colloids |accessdate=2007-10-03 |date=2002 |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |pages=153 |chapter=Electroacoustic Theory |chapterurl=http://www.dispersion.com/pages/theory/electroacoustictheory/electoracoustictheory.html |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electric sonic amplitude==
{{main|Electric sonic amplitude}}
Electric sonic amplitude was experimentally discovered by Cannon with co-authors in early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Oja, T., Petersen, G., and Cannon, D. "Measurement of Electric-Kinetic Properties of a Solution", US Patent 4,497,208,1985&lt;/ref&gt; It is also widely used for characterizing ζ-potential in dispersions and emulsions. There is review of this effect theory, experimental verification and multiple applications published by Hunter.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, R.J. "Review. Recent developments in the electroacoustic characterization of colloidal suspensions and emulsions", Colloids and Surfaces, 141, 37-65, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory of CVI and ESA==
With regard to the theory of CVI and ESA, there was an important observation made by O'Brien,&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, R.W. "Electro-acoustic effects in a dilute suspension of spherical particles" J. Fluid Mech., 190, 71-86,1988&lt;/ref&gt; who linked these measured parameters with [[dynamic electrophoretic mobility]] μ&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt; \ CVI(ESA) = A\phi\mu_d\frac{\rho_p-\rho_m}{\rho_m}&lt;/math&gt;

where
: A is calibration constant, depending on frequency, but not particles properties;
: ρ&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; is particle density,
: ρ&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; density of the fluid,
: φ is volume fraction of dispersed phase,

Dynamic electrophoretic mobility is similar to [[electrophoretic mobility]] that appears in [[electrophoresis]] theory. They are identical at low frequencies and/or for sufficiently small particles.

There are several theories of the dynamic electrophoretic mobility. Their overview is given in the Ref.5. Two of them are the most important.

The first one corresponds to the Smoluchowski limit. It yields following simple expression for CVI for sufficiently small particles with negligible CVI frequency dependence:

:&lt;math&gt; \ CVI(ESA) = A\phi\frac{\varepsilon_0\varepsilon_m\zeta\Kappa_s}{\eta\Kappa_m}\frac{\rho_p-\rho_s}{\rho_s}&lt;/math&gt;

where:
: ε&lt;sub&gt;''0''&lt;/sub&gt; is vacuum dielectric permittivity,
: ε&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; is fluid dielectric permittivity,
: ζ is [[electrokinetic potential]]
: η is dynamic viscosity of the fluid,
: K&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; is conductivity of the system,
: K&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; is conductivity of the fluid,
: ρ&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; is density of the system.

This remarkably simple equation has same wide range of applicability as Smoluchowski equation  for [[electrophoresis]]. It is independent on shape of the particles, their concentration.

Validity of this equation is restricted with the following two requirements.
  
First, it is valid only for a thin [[Double layer (interfacial)|double layer]], when the [[Debye length]] is much smaller than particle's radius a:
:&lt;math&gt; {\kappa}a &gt;&gt; 1&lt;/math&gt;

Secondly, it neglects the contribution of the [[surface conductivity]]. This assumes a small [[Dukhin number]]:
:&lt;math&gt; Du &lt;&lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;

Restriction of the thin double layer limits applicability of this Smoluchowski type theory only to aqueous systems with sufficiently large particles and not very low ionic strength. This theory does not work well for nano-colloids, including proteins and polymers at low ionic strength. It is not valid for low- or non-polar fluids.

There is another theory that is applicable for the other extreme case of a thick double layer, when  
:&lt;math&gt; {\kappa}a &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;

This theory takes into consideration the double layer overlap that inevitably occurs for concentrated systems with thick double layer. This allows introduction of so-called "quasi-homogeneous" approach, when overlapped diffuse layers of particles cover the complete interparticle space. The theory becomes much simplified in this extreme case, as shown by Shilov and others.&lt;ref&gt;Shilov, V.N., Borkovskaya, Y.B. and Dukhin A.S. "Electroacoustic theory for concentrated colloids with overlapped DLs at arbitrary ka. Application to nanocolloids and nonaqueous colloids". JCIS, 277, 347-358 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Their derivation predicts that surface charge density σ is a better parameter than ζ-potential for characterizing electroacoustic phenomena in such systems. An expression for CVI simplified for small particles follows:

:&lt;math&gt; \ CVI = A\frac{2{\sigma}a}{3\eta}\frac{\phi}{1-\phi}\frac{\rho_p-\rho_s}{\rho_s}&lt;/math&gt;

In [[ecology]], '''energy flow''', also called the '''calorific flow''', refers to the flow of [[energy]] through a [[food chain]], and is the focus of study in '''ecological energetics'''. In an [[ecosystem]], [[ecologist]]s seek to [[Quantification (science)|quantify]] the relative importance of different component [[species]] and feeding relationships.

A general energy flow scenario follows:
*[[Solar energy]] is fixed by the [[photoautotroph]]s, called primary producers, like green [[plant]]s. [[Primary consumers]] absorb most of the stored energy in the plant through [[digestion]], and transform it into the form of energy they need, such as [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP), through [[cellular respiration|respiration]]. A part of the energy received by primary consumers, [[herbivore]]s, is converted to [[thermoregulation|body heat]] (an effect of respiration), which is [[radiant energy|radiated]] away and lost from the system. The loss of energy through body heat is far greater in [[warm-blooded]] animals, which must eat much more frequently than those that are [[Ectotherm|cold-blooded]]. Energy loss also occurs in the expulsion of [[digestion|undigested]] food (egesta) by [[excrement|excretion]] or [[regurgitation (digestion)|regurgitation]].
*Secondary consumers, [[carnivore]]s, then consume the primary consumers, although [[omnivore]]s also consume primary producers. Energy that had been used by the primary consumers for growth and storage is thus absorbed into the secondary consumers through the process of digestion. As with primary consumers, secondary consumers convert this energy into a more suitable form (ATP) during respiration. Again, some energy is lost from the system, since energy which the primary consumers had used for respiration and regulation of body temperature cannot be utilized by the secondary consumers.
*Tertiary consumers, which may or may not be [[apex predator]]s, then consume the secondary consumers, with some energy passed on and some lost, as with the lower levels of the food chain.
*A final link in the food chain are [[decomposer]]s which break down the [[organic matter]] of the tertiary consumers (or whichever consumer is at the top of the chain) and release [[nutrient]]s into the [[soil]]. They also break down plants, herbivores and carnivores that were not eaten by organisms higher on the food chain, as well as the undigested food that is excreted by herbivores and carnivores. [[Saprotrophic nutrition|Saprotrophic]] [[bacteria]] and [[fungi]] are decomposers, and play a pivotal role in the [[nitrogen cycle|nitrogen]] and [[carbon cycle]]s.

The energy is passed on from [[trophic level]] to trophic level and each time about 90% of the energy is lost, with some being lost as heat into the environment (an effect of [[respiration (physiology)|respiration]]) and some being lost as incompletely digested food (egesta). Therefore, primary consumers get about 10% of the energy produced by autotrophs, while secondary consumers get 1% and tertiary consumers get 0.1%. This means the top consumer of a [[food chain]] receives the least energy, as a lot of the food chain's energy has been lost between trophic levels. This loss of energy at each level limits typical food chains to only four to six links.

== History of ecological energetics ==
Ecological energetics appears to have grown out of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and the concerns of the [[Physiocrats]]. It began in the works of [[Sergei Podolinsky]] in the late 1800s, and subsequently was developed by the Soviet ecologist [[Vladmir Stanchinsky]], the Austro-American [[Alfred J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7673">'''Energy Management Software''' ('''EMS''') is a general term and category referring to a variety of energy-related software &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mahmud|first1=Khizir|last2=Town|first2=Graham E.|title=A review of computer tools for modeling electric vehicle energy requirements and their impact on power distribution networks|journal=Applied Energy|date=June 2016|volume=172|pages=337–359|doi=10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.03.100}}&lt;/ref&gt; applications which may provide utility bill tracking, real-time metering, building HVAC and lighting control systems, building simulation and modeling, carbon and sustainability reporting, IT equipment management, [[demand response]], and/or energy audits. Managing energy can require a system of systems approach.&lt;ref&gt;Curry, Edward. 2012. [http://www.edwardcurry.org/publications/Curry_LinkedDataspaceForSOS_SOSE.pdf “System of Systems Information Interoperability Using a Linked Dataspace.”] In IEEE 7th International Conference on System of Systems Engineering (SOSE 2012), 101–106.&lt;/ref&gt;

Energy management software often provides tools for reducing energy costs and consumption for buildings or communities. EMS collects energy data and uses it for three main purposes: Reporting, Monitoring and Engagement. Reporting may include verification of energy data, benchmarking, and setting high-level energy use reduction targets. Monitoring may include trend analysis and tracking [[energy consumption]] to identify cost-saving opportunities. Engagement can mean real-time responses (automated or manual), or the initiation of a dialogue between occupants and building managers to promote [[energy conservation]]. One engagement method that has recently gained popularity is the real-time energy consumption display available in web applications or an onsite energy dashboard/display.

==Data collection==
Energy Management Software collects historic and/or [[real-time data|real-time]] [[interval data]], with intervals varying from quarterly billing statements to minute-by-minute [[smart meter]] readings. The data are collected from interval meters, [[Building automation|Building Automation Systems (BAS)]], directly from utilities, directly from sensors on electrical circuits,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SiteSage EMS architecture|url=https://powerhousedynamics.com/solutions/sitesage/#architecture}}&lt;/ref&gt; or other sources. Past bills can be used to provide a comparison between pre- and post-EMS energy consumption.

Electricity and Natural Gas are the most common utilities measured, though systems may monitor steam, petroleum or other energy uses, water use, and even locally generated energy. Renewable energy sources have contributed to the spurred growth in EMS data collection markets.

==Reporting==
Reporting tools are targeted at owners and executives who want to automate energy and emissions auditing. Cost and consumption data from a number of buildings can be aggregated or compared with the software, saving time relative to manual reporting. EMS offers more detailed energy information than utility billing can provide; another advantage is that outside factors affecting energy use, such as weather or building occupancy, can be accounted for as part of the reporting process. This information can be used to prioritize energy savings initiatives and balance energy savings against energy-related capital expenditures.

Bill verification can be used to compare metered consumption against billed consumption. Bill analysis can also demonstrate the impact of different energy costs, for example by comparing electrical demand charges to consumption costs.

Greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting can calculate direct or indirect [[Greenhouse gas emissions|GHG emissions]], which may be used for internal reporting or [[enterprise carbon accounting]].

==Monitoring==
Monitoring tools track and display real-time and historical data. Often, EMS includes various benchmarking tools, such as energy consumption per square foot, weather normalization or more advanced analysis using energy modeling algorithms to identify anomalous consumption. Seeing exactly when energy is used, combined with anomaly recognition, can allow Facility or Energy Managers to identify savings opportunities.

Initiatives such as demand shaving, replacement of malfunctioning equipment, retrofits of inefficient equipment, and removal of unnecessary loads can be discovered and coordinated using the EMS. For example, an unexpected energy spike at a specific time each day may indicate an improperly set or malfunctioning timer. These tools can also be used for Energy Monitoring and Targeting. EMS uses models to correct for variable factors such as weather when performing historical comparisons to verify the effect of conservation and efficiency initiatives.

EMS may offer alerts, via text or email messages, when consumption values exceed pre-defined thresholds based on consumption or cost. These thresholds may be set at absolute levels, or use an energy model to determine when consumption is abnormally high or low. More recently, smartphones and tablets are becoming mainstream platforms for EMS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Serious Energy Management Software uses Smartphones |url=http://www.seriousenergy.com/energy-management/software/sem.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110619012549/http://www.seriousenergy.com:80/energy-management/software/sem.html |archivedate=2011-06-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Powerhouse Dynamics’ mobile app expands real-time facility ops and energy management capabilities|url=http://www.chainstoreage.com/article/powerhouse-dynamics-mobile-app-expands-real-time-facility-ops-and-energy-management-capabil}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Engagement==
Engagement can refer to automated or manual responses to collected and analyzed energy data. Building control systems can respond as readily to energy fluctuation as a heating system can respond to temperature variation. Demand spikes can trigger equipment power-down processes, with or without human intervention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.echome.co.uk/renewable-energy-services/heating-and-lighting-controls/ "Building Automation and Control"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another objective of Engagement is to connect occupants’ daily choices with building energy consumption. By displaying real-time consumption information, occupants see the immediate impact of their actions. The software can be used to promote energy conservation initiatives, offer advice to the occupants, or provide a forum for feedback on sustainability initiatives.

People-driven energy conservation programs, such as those sponsored by Energy Education, can be highly effective in reducing energy use and cost. 

Letting occupants know their real-time consumption alone can be responsible for a 7% reduction in energy consumption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://americancity.org/afteroil/entry/1136/ "The Prius Effect"] by [http://americancity.org/afteroil/entry/1136/ Elizabeth Dickinson]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Generic energy system supplying fuels and electricity.svg|thumb|300px|Physical components of a generic energy system supplying fuels and electricity (but not [[district heating|district heat]]) to end-users]]

An '''energy system''' is a system primarily designed to supply [[#Energy-services|energy-services]] to [[end user|end-users]].&lt;ref name="groscurth-etal-1995"/&gt;{{rp|941}}  Taking a structural viewpoint, the [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report]] defines an energy system as "all components related to the production, conversion, delivery, and use of energy".&lt;ref name="allwood-etal-2014"/&gt;{{rp|1261}}  The field of [[energy economics]] includes [[energy market]]s and treats an energy system as the technical and economic systems that satisfy [[consumer demand]] for energy in the forms of [[heat]], [[fuel]]s, and [[electricity]].&lt;ref name="groscurth-etal-1995"/&gt;{{rp|941}}

The first two definitions allow for demand-side measures, including [[daylighting]], retrofitted [[building insulation]], and [[passive solar building design]], as well as socio-economic factors, such as aspects of [[energy demand management]] and even [[telecommuting]], while the third does not.  Neither does the third account for the [[Informal sector|informal economy]] in traditional [[biomass]] that is significant in many [[Developing country|developing countries]].&lt;ref name="van-ruijven-etal-2008"/&gt;

The analysis of energy systems thus spans the disciplines of [[engineering]] and [[economics]].&lt;ref name="hoffman-and-wood-1976"/&gt;{{rp|1}}  Merging ideas from both areas to form a coherent description, particularly where [[macroeconomic]] dynamics are involved, is challenging.&lt;ref name="boehringer-and-rutherford-2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="herbst-etal-2012"/&gt;

The concept of an energy system is evolving as new regulations, technologies, and practices enter into service – for example, [[emissions trading]], the development of [[smart grid]]s, and the greater use of [[energy demand management]], respectively.

== Treatment ==

{{see also|Energy industry|Energy modeling}}
&lt;!-- {(see also|Energy industry|Energy modeling|Open energy system models}} --&gt;

From a structural perspective, an energy system is like any [[System|general system]] and is made up of a set of interacting component parts, located within an environment.&lt;ref name="merriam-webster-system"/&gt;  These components derive from ideas found in [[engineering]] and [[economics]].  Taking a process view, an energy system "consists of an integrated set of technical and economic activities operating within a complex societal framework".&lt;ref name="hoffman-and-wood-1976"/&gt;{{rp|423}}  The identification of the components and behaviors of an energy system depends on the circumstances, the purpose of the analysis, and the questions under investigation.  The concept of an energy system is therefore an [[Abstraction (software engineering)|abstraction]] which usually precedes some form of computer-based investigation, such as the construction and use of a suitable [[energy modeling|energy model]].&lt;ref name="anandarajah-etal-2009"/&gt;

Viewed in engineering terms, an energy system lends itself to representation as a [[flow network]]: the [[Glossary of graph theory#vertex|vertices]] map to engineering components like [[power station]]s and [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]] and the [[Glossary of graph theory#edge|edges]] map to the interfaces between these components.  This approach allows collections of similar or adjacent components to be aggregated and treated as one to simplify the model.  Once described thus, flow network algorithms, such as [[minimum-cost flow problem|minimum cost flow]], may be applied.&lt;ref name="quelhas-etal-2007"/&gt;  The components themselves can be treated as simple [[dynamical systems]] in their own right.&lt;ref name="groscurth-etal-1995"/&gt;

Conversely, relatively pure economic modeling may adopt a sectorial approach with only limited engineering detail present.  The sector and sub-sector categories published by the [[International Energy Agency]] are often used as a basis for this analysis.  A 2009 study of the UK residential energy sector contrasts the use of the technology-rich [[Markal model]] with several UK sectoral housing stock models.&lt;ref name="kannan-and-strachan-2007"/&gt;

International [[statistical study of energy data|energy statistics]] are typically broken down by carrier, sector and sub-sector, and country.&lt;ref name="ires-2016"/&gt;  Energy carriers ({{abbr|aka|also known as}} energy products) are further classified as [[primary energy]] and [[primary energy#Conversion to energy carriers (or secondary energy)|secondary]] (or intermediate) energy and sometimes final (or end-use) energy.  Published energy datasets are normally adjusted so that they are internally consistent, meaning that all energy stocks and flows must [[Energy balance (energy economics)|balance]].  The IEA regularly publishes energy statistics and energy balances with varying levels of detail and cost and also offers mid-term projections based on this data.&lt;ref name="iea-2016a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iea-2016b"/&gt;  The notion of an energy carrier, as used in [[energy economics]], is distinct and different from the definition of [[energy]] used in physics.

Energy systems can range in scope, from local, municipal, national, and regional, to global, depending on issues under investigation.  Researchers may or may not include demand side measures within their definition of an energy system.  The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] does so, for instance, but covers these measures in separate chapters on transport, buildings, industry, and agriculture.{{efn|The IPCC chapter on agriculture is titled: Agriculture, forestry, and other land use (AFOLU).}}&lt;ref name="allwood-etal-2014"/&gt;{{rp|1261}}&lt;ref name="bruckner-etal-2014"/&gt;{{rp|516}}

Household consumption and investment decisions may also be included within the ambit of an energy system.  Such considerations are not common because consumer behavior is difficult to characterize, but the trend is to include human factors in models.  Household decision-taking may be represented using techniques from [[bounded rationality]] and [[Agent-based model|agent-based behavior]].&lt;ref name="wittmann-and-bruckner-2009"/&gt;  The [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (AAAS) specifically advocates that "more attention should be paid to incorporating behavioral considerations other than price- and income-driven behavior into economic models [of the energy system]".&lt;ref name="aaas-2011"/&gt;{{rp|6}}

== Energy-services ==

{{see also|Energy conservation|Efficient energy use}}

The concept of an energy-service is central, particularly when defining the purpose of an energy system:

{{quote|It is important to realize that the use of energy is no end in itself but is always directed to satisfy human needs and desires. Energy services are the ends for which the energy system provides the means.&lt;ref name="groscurth-etal-1995"/&gt;{{rp|941}}}}

Energy-services can be defined as amenities that are either furnished through energy consumption or could have been thus supplied.&lt;ref name="morrison-etal-2005"/&gt;{{rp|2}}  More explicitly:

{{quote|Demand should, where possible, be defined in terms of energy-service provision, as characterized by an appropriate intensity{{efn|The term ''intensity'' refers to quantities which do not scale with component size.  See [[intensive and extensive properties]].}} – for example, air [[temperature]] in the case of space-heating or [[lux]] levels for [[illuminance]]. This approach facilitates a much greater set of potential responses to the question of supply, including the use of energetically-passive techniques – for instance, retrofitted [[Building insulation|insulation]] and [[daylighting]].&lt;ref name="bruckner-etal-2003"/&gt;{{rp|156}}}}

A consideration of energy-services per capita and how such services contribute to human welfare and individual quality of life is paramount to the debate on [[sustainable energy]].  People living in poor regions with low levels of energy-services consumption would clearly benefit from greater consumption, but the same is not generally true for those with high levels of consumption.&lt;ref name="haas-etal-2008"/&gt;

The notion of energy-services has given rise to [[energy service company|energy-service companies]] (ESCo) who contract to provide energy-services to a client for an extended period.  The ESCo is then free to choose the best means to do so, including investments in the thermal performance and [[HVAC]] equipment of the buildings in question.&lt;ref name="duplessis-etal-2012"/&gt;

== ISO 13600, 13601, 13602 on technical energy systems ==

ISO{{nnbsp}}13600, ISO{{nnbsp}}13601, and ISO{{nnbsp}}13602 form a set of [[international standard]]s covering technical energy systems (TES).&lt;ref name="iso-13600-1997-main"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iso-13600-1997-corrigendum-1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iso-13601-1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iso-13602-2002"/&gt;  Although withdrawn prior to 2016, these documents provide useful definitions and a framework for formalizing such systems.  The standards depict an energy system broken down into supply and demand sectors, linked by the flow of tradable energy commodities (or energywares).  Each sector has a set of inputs and outputs, some intentional and some harmful byproducts.  Sectors may be further divided into subsectors, each fulfilling a dedicated purpose.  The demand sector is ultimately present to supply energyware-based services to consumers (see [[#Energy-services|energy-services]]).

 | quote = In energy economics, energy systems are usually defined as technical and economic systems meeting the energy demand.  "However, the energy demand is not a fixed quantity but is subject to various influences, e.g., prices, regulations, and consumer preferences. Thus, the definition of energy systems should provide a much broader, socioeconomic view and refer to the technical and economic side of energy supply as well as the socioeconomic phenomena occurring in a society, which uses energy to enhance its standard of living; furthermore the impact on the natural environment is important. ... It is important to realize that the use of energy is no end in itself but is always directed to satisfy human needs and desires. Energy services are the ends for which the energy system provides the means. (page 941)

 | quote = The energy system consists of an integrated set of technical and economic activities operating within a complex societal framework.  Energy is a vital component in the economic and social well-being of a nation and must be considered explicitly in the formulation of regional, national, and international policy.  As the importance of energy in policy making has become apparent, research and analysis in the field of energy system modeling and forecasting has grown rapidly.  The field has evolved from one almost exclusively the domain of planning groups in the major sectors of the energy industry and of government regulatory agencies to one in which many Federal and State agencies are active in the development and application of energy models and forecasts.  Energy system models are now used extensively for regional, national and international forecasting and for policy formulation and analysis.

'''''Final Straw: Food, Earth, Happiness''''' is a documentary/art film released in June 2015 that takes audiences through farms and urban landscapes in [[Japan]], [[South Korea]], and the [[United States]], interviewing leading practitioners in the [[Natural farming|Natural Farming]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Hong|first=Ryoseok|title=Final Straw: Food, Earth, Happiness|date=2000-01-01|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3709036/|last2=Kawaguchi|last3=Korn|first2=Yoshikazu|first3=Larry|accessdate=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film began when an environmental artist (Patrick M. Lydon) and an environmental book editor (Suhee Kang), had a chance meeting in Seoul, South Korea, and began conducting short interviews together with leaders in the ecology and social justice movements. Upon meeting Korean farmer Seong Hyun Choi however, the two were so impressed by his ecological mindset and way of working, that they set out to produce a feature film about the movement. Lydon and Kang ended up quitting their jobs, giving away most of their possessions, and becoming voluntarily homeless for four years in order to afford producing the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.kimchiandbasil.com/interview-final-straw/|title=Final straw: food, earth, happiness - Kimchi&amp;Basil|date=2016-02-20|work=Kimchi&amp;Basil|access-date=2017-04-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.finalstraw.org/a-root-solution/|title=A ‘Root’ Solution {{!}} Final Straw – Food {{!}} Earth {{!}} Happiness|website=www.finalstraw.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/2016/12/21/lydon-ghost-ship-raises-broad-questions-about-art-and-culture/|title=Lydon: Ghost Ship raises big questions about arts and culture|last=|first=|date=|website=San Jose Mercury News|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film is split into three sections 1) Modern Life, 2) Foundations and Mindset of Natural Farming, and 3) Natural Farming in Practice and Life. According to the filmmakers, as they began to understand more about how natural farming itself was not rooted in methods, but in a way of thinking, they chose to explore the life philosophies and ways of thinking of natural farming practitioners in a more free-flowing and artistic way, rather than an instructive one; the result is an unconventional documentary that features slow paced musical interludes alongside interviews. Reviewers have called both "meditative, and mindful," and "an inspiring call to action."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mindfulpie.com/one-straw-revolution/|title=Love nature, eat well – Mindful Pie|website=mindfulpie.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cleaneatingmag.com/|title=Eco Farming|last=|first=|date=July 1, 2015|work=Clean Eating Magazine|access-date=August 1, 2015|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|publisher=Active Interest Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author and musician [[Alicia Bay Laurel]] called the film "both art and documentary".

== Production ==
Lydon and Kang spent what they call a "meager" life savings to make the film, along with the volunteer efforts of farmers, translators, writers, musicians they had met during their journey. Although the film was filmed, written, and edited entirely by the two directors, they readily admit that the process of making the film was co-operative effort, with more than 200 volunteers directly involved in the process in some way. The soundtrack was recorded with professional musicians from each of the three countries where filming took place, all of whom donated their time to contribute to the film project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.finalstraw.org/film-soundtrack-recording-with-windsync/|title=Film Soundtrack Recording with WindSync {{!}} Final Straw – Food {{!}} Earth {{!}} Happiness|website=www.finalstraw.org|language=en|access-date=2017-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the continued help of international volunteers, the film is available in four languages (English, Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese), and three more (Chinese, Portuguese, French) are in progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cbjournalism.com/2016/03/24/filmmaker-spotlight-patrick-lydon-suhee-king/|title=Filmmaker Spotlight: Patrick Lydon &amp; Suhee King|date=2016-03-24|website=Chelsea Breaks the News|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.finalstraw.org/film-soundtrack-recording-with-windsync/|title=Film Soundtrack Recording with WindSync {{!}} Final Straw – Food {{!}} Earth {{!}} Happiness|website=www.finalstraw.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.finalstraw.org/the-documentary/|title=The Documentary {{!}} Final Straw – Food {{!}} Earth {{!}} Happiness|website=www.finalstraw.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tour and critical reception ==

Frustrated by the lack of distribution and film festival options for low- and no-budget films, the filmmakers made the decision to manage distribution and touring in the same way they went about filming, through co-operative effort. With the help of volunteers, independent theater owners, and community organizers, they launched an extensive tour throughout Japan and South Korea from 2015-2016, eventually screening the film at over 130 venues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.finalstraw.org/tour-dates-and-screenings/|title=Tour Dates and Screenings {{!}} Final Straw – Food {{!}} Earth {{!}} Happiness|website=www.finalstraw.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rather than simply screening the film, the filmmakers decided to transition their existing media production organization ''SocieCity,'' into a vehicle for art and community engagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://artseverywhere.ca/2016/03/07/social-practice-artwork-a-restaurant-and-garden-serving-up-connections-to-urban-nature/|title=Social Practice Artwork: A Restaurant and Garden Serving up Connections to Urban Nature|last=|first=|date=|website=artseverywhere.ca|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; They made a point of hosting interactive events along with their screenings and in several cases, stayed in communities for up to three months at a time to build natural gardens and host a project they call REALtimeFOOD, a grown-to-order restaurant which connects the ideas from the film with real-world practices in farming, food, and crafts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.naver.com/barndining_/220514125842|title=Bar&amp;Dining Magazine : 네이버 블로그|website=blog.naver.com|language=ko|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://setouchiexplorer.com/real-time-food-project-day-one-worlds-slowest-restaurant-opening/|title=REAL time FOOD Project - Day One - World's Slowest Restaurant Opening|date=2016-09-18|work=Setouchi Explorer|access-date=2017-04-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases, these efforts were funded by grants from local philanthropic organizations and/or supported by the communities themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chishimatochi.info/found/index.php/archives/service/1961|title=おおさか創造千島財団  » 2015年度|website=www.chishimatochi.info|language=ja|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sustainablepractice.org/2013/11/15/final-straw/|title=Final Straw|date=2013-11-15|website=The CSPA|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interested in the unconventional way the film was being made and toured, multiple magazines and newspapers in Japan and Korea followed the directors during several parts of their journey, notably ESSEN, Bar and Dining, and Road magazines, and Shikoku Shinbun and Huffington Post newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.finalstraw.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/shikoku-newspaper-english.pdf|title=Connecting to Life with Natural Farming in Megijima|last=|first=|date=September 18, 2016|work=Shikoku Shinbun|access-date=17 April 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.kr/salimstory/story_b_8476176.html|title="모든 것이 연결되어 있다는 깨달음이 시작"|website=허핑턴포스트|language=ko-KR|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://navercast.naver.com/magazine_contents.nhn?rid=1095&amp;contents_id=45426|title=내일의 식문화를 일구는 사람들이 보내 온 새해 편지|access-date=2017-04-18|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the tour, the film was eventually picked up by festivals including Tassie Eco Film Festival and Belleville Doc Fest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://downtowndocfest.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Belleville%20Downtown%20DocFest%20Program_2016.pdf|title=Belleville International Documentary Festival - Official Program|last=|first=|date=1 February 2016|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This '''timeline of the Big Bang''' shows a sequence of events as currently theorized by scientists. 

It is a [[logarithmic scale]] that shows &lt;math&gt;10 \cdot \log_{10}&lt;/math&gt; ''second'' instead of ''second''. For example, one microsecond is &lt;math&gt;10 \cdot \log_{10} 0.000 001 = 10 \cdot (-6) = -60&lt;/math&gt;. To convert -30 read on the scale to second calculate &lt;math&gt;10^{-\frac{30}{10}} = 10^{-3} = 0.001&lt;/math&gt; second = one millisecond. On a logarithmic time scale a step lasts ten times longer than the previous step.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18436">{{short description|A theoretical upper limit on the energy of cosmic ray protons}}
The '''Greisen–Zatsepin–Kuzmin limit''' ('''GZK limit''') is a theoretical upper limit on the energy of [[cosmic ray]] [[proton]]s traveling from other galaxies through the intergalactic medium to our galaxy. The limit is {{val|5|e=19|ul=eV}}, or about 8&amp;nbsp;[[joule]]s. The limit is set by slowing-interactions of the protons with the [[Cosmic microwave background radiation|microwave background radiation]] over long distances (~160 million light-years). The limit is at the same order of magnitude as the upper limit for energy at which cosmic rays have experimentally been detected. For example, one [[extreme-energy cosmic ray]] has been detected which appeared to possess a record {{val|3.12|e=20|u=eV}} (50 joules) of energy (about the same as the kinetic energy of a 35&amp;nbsp;mph baseball).

The GZK limit is derived under the assumption that ultra-high energy cosmic rays are protons. Measurements by the largest cosmic-ray observatory, the [[Pierre Auger Observatory]], suggest that most ultra-high energy cosmic rays are heavier elements.&lt;ref name="Aab2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aab|first1=Aexander|last2=others|title=Inferences on Mass Composition and Tests of Hadronic Interactions from 0.3 to 100 EeV using the water-Cherenkov Detectors of the Pierre Auger Observatory|journal=Submitted to Phys. Rev. D|date=2017|url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.07249.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, the argument behind the GZK limit does not apply in the originally simple form and there is no fundamental contradiction in observing cosmic rays with energies that violate the limit.

In the past, the apparent violation of the GZK limit has inspired cosmologists and theoretical physicists to suggest other ways that circumvent the limit. These theories propose that ultra-high energy cosmic rays are produced nearby our galaxy or that [[Lorentz covariance]] is violated in such a way that protons do not lose energy on their way to our galaxy.

==Computation==
The limit was independently computed in 1966 by [[Kenneth Greisen]],&lt;ref name="Greisen1966"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Greisen |first=Kenneth |authorlink= |date=1966 |title=End to the Cosmic-Ray Spectrum? |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=16 |issue=17 |pages=748&amp;ndash;750 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.16.748 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |bibcode=1966PhRvL..16..748G}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vadim Kuzmin (physicist)|Vadim Kuzmin]], and [[Georgiy Zatsepin]],&lt;ref name="Zatsepin"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zatsepin |first=G. T. |last2=Kuz'min |first2=V. A. |date=1966 |title=Upper Limit of the Spectrum of Cosmic Rays |journal=Journal of Experimental and Theoretical Physics Letters |volume=4 |issue= |pages=78&amp;ndash;80 |bibcode=1966JETPL...4...78Z |url=http://www.jetpletters.ac.ru/ps/1624/article_24846.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; based on interactions between [[cosmic ray]]s and the photons of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] (CMB). They predicted that cosmic rays with energies over the threshold energy of {{val|5|e=19|ul=eV}} would interact with cosmic microwave background photons &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{\rm CMB}&lt;/math&gt;, relatively [[blueshift]]ed by the speed of the cosmic rays, to produce [[pion]]s via the [[Delta baryon|&lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; resonance]],

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_{\rm CMB}+p\rightarrow\Delta^+\rightarrow p + \pi^0,&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma_{\rm CMB}+p\rightarrow\Delta^+\rightarrow n + \pi^+.&lt;/math&gt;
Pions produced in this manner proceed to decay in the standard pion channels—ultimately to photons for neutral pions, and photons, positrons, and various neutrinos for positive pions. Neutrons decay also to similar products, so that ultimately the energy of any cosmic ray proton is drained off by production of high energy photons plus (in some cases) high energy electron/positron pairs and neutrino pairs.

The pion production process begins at a higher energy than ordinary electron-positron [[pair production]] (lepton production) from protons impacting the CMB, which starts at cosmic ray proton energies of only about {{val|e=17|ul=eV}}. However, pion production events drain 20% of the energy of a cosmic ray proton as compared with only 0.1% of its energy for electron positron pair production. This factor of 200 is from two sources: the pion has only about ~130 times the mass of the leptons, but the extra energy appears as different kinetic energies of the pion or leptons, and results in relatively more kinetic energy transferred to a heavier product pion, in order to conserve momentum. The much larger total energy losses from pion production result in the pion production process becoming the limiting one to high energy cosmic ray travel, rather than the lower-energy light-lepton production process.

The pion production process continues until the cosmic ray energy falls below the pion production threshold. Due to the mean path associated with this interaction, extragalactic cosmic rays traveling over distances larger than {{val|50|ul=Mpc}} ({{val|163|ul=Mly}}) and with energies greater than this threshold should never be observed on Earth. This distance is also known as GZK horizon.

==Cosmic ray paradox==
{{unsolved|physics|Why is it that some cosmic rays appear to possess [[energy|energies]] that are theoretically too high, given that there are no possible near-Earth sources, and that rays from distant sources should have scattered off the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]]?}}

A number of observations have been made by the largest cosmic ray experiments [[Akeno Giant Air Shower Array]], [[High Resolution Fly's Eye Cosmic Ray Detector]], the [[Pierre Auger Observatory]] and [[Telescope Array Project]] that appeared to show cosmic rays with energies above this limit (called [[extreme-energy cosmic ray]]s, or EECRs). The observation of these particles was the so-called '''GZK paradox''' or '''cosmic ray paradox'''.

These observations appear to contradict the predictions of [[special relativity]] and [[particle physics]] as they are presently understood. However, there are a number of possible explanations for these observations that may resolve this inconsistency.
*The observations could be due to an instrument error or an incorrect interpretation of the experiment, especially wrong energy assignment.
*The cosmic rays could have local sources well within the GZK horizon (although it is unclear what these sources could be).
*Cosmic rays are mostly heavier nuclei with &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; nucleons. The energy per nucleon in a nucleus is by a factor &lt;math&gt;1/A&lt;/math&gt; lower, which correspondingly pushes the effective GZK limit for the whole nucleus up by a factor &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. For iron nuclei (the heaviest abundant element in cosmic rays), the corresponding energy limit for the whole nucleus is {{val|2.8|e=21|u=eV}}, which is well beyond the energies of detected ultra-high-energy cosmic rays.

===Weakly interacting particles===
Another suggestion involves ultra-high energy weakly interacting particles (for instance, [[neutrino]]s) which might be created at great distances and later react locally to give rise to the particles observed. In the proposed Z-burst model, an ultra-high energy cosmic neutrino collides with a relic anti-neutrino in our galaxy and annihilates to hadrons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fargion |first1=D. |last2=Mele |first2=B. |last3=Salis |first3=A. |title=Ultra–High‐Energy Neutrino Scattering onto Relic Light Neutrinos in the Galactic Halo as a Possible Source of the Highest Energy Extragalactic Cosmic Rays |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |date=June 1999 |volume=517 |issue=2 |pages=725–733 |doi=10.1086/307203 |arxiv=astro-ph/9710029 |bibcode=1999ApJ...517..725F }}&lt;/ref&gt; This process proceeds via a (virtual) Z-boson:

&lt;math&gt;\nu + \bar{\nu}\rightarrow Z\rightarrow \text{hadrons}&lt;/math&gt;

The cross section for this process becomes large if the center of mass energy of the neutrino antineutrino pair is equal to the Z-boson mass (such a peak in the cross section is called "resonance"). Assuming that the relic anti-neutrino is at rest, the energy of the incident cosmic neutrino has to be:

&lt;math&gt;E = \frac{m_{Z}^{2}}{2 m_{\nu}}= 4.2\times 10^{21} \left(\frac{\text{eV}}{m_{\nu}}\right)\text{eV}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;m_{Z}&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the Z-boson and &lt;math&gt;m_{\nu}&lt;/math&gt; the mass of the neutrino.

===Other theories===
A number of exotic theories have been advanced to explain the AGASA observations, including [[doubly special relativity]]. However, it is now established that standard doubly special relativity does not predict any GZK suppression (or GZK cutoff), contrary to models of Lorentz symmetry violation involving an absolute rest frame.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} Other possible theories involve [[Ultra-high-energy cosmic ray#Relation with dark matter|a relation with dark matter]], decays of exotic super-heavy particles beyond those known in the [[Standard Model]].

==Controversy about cosmic rays above the GZK limit==
A suppression of the cosmic ray flux which can be explained with the GZK limit has been confirmed by the latest generation of cosmic ray observatories. A former claim by the [[AGASA]] experiment that there is no suppression was overruled. It remains controversial, whether the suppression is due to the GZK effect. The GZK limit only applies if ultra-high energy cosmic rays are mostly protons.

In July 2007, during the 30th International Cosmic Ray Conference in Mérida, Yucatán, México, the [[High Resolution Fly's Eye Cosmic Ray Detector|High Resolution Fly's Eye Experiment]] (HiRes) and the [[Pierre Auger Observatory]] (Auger) presented their results on ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. HiRes observed a suppression in the UHECR spectrum at just the right energy, observing only 13 events with an energy above the threshold, while expecting 43 with no suppression. This was interpreted as the first observation of the GZK limit.&lt;ref name="Abbasi2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Abbasi |first=R. U. |authorlink= |display-authors=etal |date=2008 |title=First Observation of the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin Suppression |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=100 |issue= 10|pages=101101 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.100.101101 |id= |url= |accessdate= |quote= |pmid=18352170 |arxiv=astro-ph/0703099 |bibcode=2008PhRvL.100j1101A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Auger confirmed the flux suppression, but did not claim it to be the GZK limit: instead of the 30 events necessary to confirm the AGASA results, Auger saw only two, which are believed to be heavy nuclei events.&lt;ref name="Abraham2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Abraham |first=J. |authorlink= |display-authors=etal |date=2008 | title=Observation of the suppression of the flux of cosmic rays above 4×10&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; eV |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=101 |issue=6 |pages=061101–1–061101–7 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.101.061101 |id= |url= |accessdate= |quote= |arxiv=0806.4302 |bibcode=2008PhRvL.101f1101A}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flux suppression was previously brought into question when the AGASA experiment found no suppression in their spectrum{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}. According to [[Alan Andrew Watson|Alan Watson]], spokesperson for the Auger Collaboration, AGASA results have been shown to be incorrect, possibly due to the systematic shift in energy assignment.

In 2010 and the following years, both the Pierre Auger Observatory and HiRes confirmed again a flux suppression,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=2010|title=Measurement of the energy spectrum of cosmic rays above {{val|e=18|u=eV}} using the Pierre Auger Observatory|url=|journal=Phys. Lett. B|volume=685|issue=4&amp;ndash;5|pages=239&amp;ndash;246|arxiv=1002.1975|bibcode=2010PhLB..685..239A|doi=10.1016/j.physletb.2010.02.013|pmid=|quote=|author=The Pierre Auger Collaboration|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|eprint=1010.2690|author1=Sokolsky|author2=for the HiRes Collaboration|title=Final Results from the High Resolution Fly's Eye (HiRes) Experiment|class=astro-ph.HE|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in case of the Pierre Auger Observatory the effect is statistically significant at the level of 20 standard deviations.

After the flux suppression was established, a heated debate ensued whether cosmic rays that violate the GZK limit are protons. The Pierre Auger Observatory, the world's largest observatory, found with high statistical significance that ultra-high energy cosmic rays are not purely protons, but a mixture of elements which is getting heavier with increasing energy.&lt;ref name="Aab2017"/&gt;
The [[Telescope Array Project]], a joint effort from members of the HiRes and AGASA collaborations, agrees with the former HiRes result that these cosmic rays look like protons.&lt;ref name="Hanlon2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hanlon|first1=William|last2=others|title=Telescope Array Composition Summary|journal=PoS|date=2017|volume=301|issue=536|url=https://pos.sissa.it/301/536/pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The claim is based on data with lower statistical significance, however. The area covered by Telescope Array is about one third of the area covered by the Pierre Auger Observatory, and the latter has been running for a longer time.

The controversy was partially resolved in 2017, when a joint working group formed by members of both experiments presented a report at the 35th International Cosmic Ray Conference.&lt;ref name="deSouza2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Souza|first1=Vitor|last2=others|title=Testing the agreement between the Xmax distributions measured by the Pierre Auger and Telescope Array Observatories|journal=PoS|date=2017|volume=301|issue=522|url=https://pos.sissa.it/301/522/pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the report, the raw experimental results are not in contradiction with each other. The different interpretations are mainly based on the use of different theoretical models (Telescope Array uses an outdated model for its interpretation), and the fact that Telescope Array has not collected enough events yet to distinguish the pure proton hypothesis from the mixed-nuclei hypothesis.

===Extreme Universe Space Observatory on Japanese Experiment Module (JEM-EUSO)===
[[Extreme Universe Space Observatory|EUSO]], which was scheduled to fly on the [[International Space Station]] (ISS) in 2009, was designed to use the atmospheric-[[fluorescence]] technique to monitor a huge area and boost the statistics of UHECRs considerably. EUSO is to make a deep survey of UHECR-induced extensive air showers (EASs) from space, extending the measured energy spectrum well beyond the GZK-cutoff. It is to search for the origin of UHECRs, determine the nature of the origin of UHECRs, make an all-sky survey of the arrival direction of UHECRs, and seek to open the astronomical window on the extreme-energy universe with neutrinos. The fate of the EUSO Observatory is still unclear since NASA is considering early retirement of the ISS.

===The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope to resolve inconsistencies===
Launched in June 2008, the [[Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope]] (formerly GLAST) will also provide data that will help resolve these inconsistencies.
*With the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, one has the possibility of detecting gamma rays from the freshly accelerated cosmic-ray nuclei at their acceleration site (the source of the UHECRs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ormes |first=Jonathan F. |authorlink= |display-authors=etal |date=2000 |title=The origin of cosmic rays: What can the Fermi Gamma-ray Telescope say? |journal=AIP Conference Proceedings |volume=528 |issue= |pages=445&amp;ndash;448 |id= |doi=10.1063/1.1324357 |quote= |arxiv=astro-ph/0003270}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*UHECR protons accelerated (see also [[Centrifugal mechanism of acceleration]]) in astrophysical objects produce ''secondary electromagnetic cascades'' during propagation in the cosmic microwave and infrared backgrounds, of which the GZK-process of pion production is one of the contributors. Such cascades can contribute between ≃1% and ≃50% of the GeV-TeV diffuse photon flux measured by the [[EGRET]] experiment. The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope may discover this flux.&lt;ref name="Kalashev2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kalashev |first=Oleg E. |authorlink= |author2=Semikoz, Dmitry V. |author3=Sigl, Guenter |date=2007 |title=Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays and the GeV-TeV Diffuse Gamma-Ray Flux |journal=Physical Review D |volume=79 |issue=6 |pages=063005 |arxiv=0704.2463 |bibcode=2009PhRvD..79f3005K|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.79.063005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible sources of UHECRs==
In November 2007, researchers at the [[Pierre Auger Observatory]] announced that they had evidence that UHECRs appear to come from the [[Active galactic nucleus|active galactic nuclei]] (AGNs) of energetic galaxies powered by matter swirling onto a supermassive black hole. The cosmic rays were detected and traced back to the AGNs using the [[Philippe Véron|Véron-Cetty-Véron]] catalog. These results are reported in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=The Pierre Auger Collaboration |date=2007 |title=Correlation of the Highest-Energy Cosmic Rays with Nearby Extragalactic Objects |journal=Science |volume=318 |issue=5852 |pages=938&amp;ndash;943 |doi=10.1126/science.1151124 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |arxiv=0711.2256 |pmid=17991855 |bibcode = 2007Sci...318..938P }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the strength of the correlation with AGNs from this particular catalog for the Auger data recorded after 2007 has been slowly diminishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=The Pierre Auger Collaboration |date=2010 |title=Update on the correlation of the highest energy cosmic rays with nearby extragalactic matter |journal=Astropart.

[[Andreas Cellarius]], German mathematician and cartographer (1596–1665), conceived an Atlas of the Universe, published in 1660, under the title of ''[[Harmonia Macrocosmica]]''. Numerous illustrations of the solar system appear in this atlas by different authors known at that time. Referring to Ptolemy, Cellarius called the representation of this Ptolemaic conception of heaven as "Imago universi secundum Ptolaeum"

''Imago'' is a word in [[Latin]] which means'' 'image''' or even "representation". Therefore, the title expresses the "Picture of the Universe according to Ptolemy." The Latin expression was used in the Middle Ages to express the representation and size of the known world at that time.

''Imago Universi'' is also the title, in Latin, of a [[cosmography|cosmographic]] treatise, written in 2013 by the Spanish scientist Gabriel Barceló.

After analyzing the history of cosmology, the treatise delves into the prevailing scientific lack of explanation of the rotation of the heavenly bodies in the laws of dynamic behaviour of the sidereal system. The author proposes the application of the [[Theory of Dynamic Interactions]] (TID) to astrophysics, in particular, the dynamics of stellar systems and galaxies. This theory allows new comprehension of the dynamics of nature and understands the dynamic equilibrium of the universe, always subjected to rotational accelerations, but repetitive and persistent. The author also highlights that the orbiting always coincides with the intrinsic rotation of celestial bodies. Paradox incorporating the book, noting that this had not been found to date.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2438">In the [[outline of physical science|physical sciences]], an '''interface''' is the boundary between two spatial regions occupied by different matter, or by matter in different physical states. The interface between matter and air, or matter and vacuum, is called a '''surface''', and studied in [[surface science]]. In [[thermal equilibrium]], the regions in contact are called [[phase (matter)|phases]], and the interface is called a [[phase boundary]]. An example for an interface out of equilibrium is the [[grain boundary]] in polycrystalline matter.

The importance of the interface depends on the type of system: the bigger the quotient area/volume, the greater the effect the interface will have. Consequently, interfaces are very important in systems with large interface area-to-volume ratios, such as [[colloid]]s.

Interfaces can be flat or curved. For example, [[oil]] droplets  in a [[salad dressing]] are spherical but the interface between water and air in a glass of water is mostly flat.

[[Surface tension]] is the physical property which rules interface processes involving liquids. For a liquid film on flat surfaces, the liquid-vapor interface keeps flat to minimize interfacial area and system [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]]. For a liquid film on rough surfaces, the [[surface tension]] tends to keep the [[Meniscus (liquid)|meniscus]] flat, while the [[disjoining pressure]] makes the film conformal to the substrate. The equilibrium meniscus shape is a result of the competition between the [[capillary pressure]] and [[disjoining pressure]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/nl5037066 Han Hu, Christopher R. Weinberger, and Ying Sun ''[[Nano Lett.]]'', 14 (12), pp 7131–7137 (2014)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Interfaces may cause various [[optical phenomena]], such as [[refraction]].  [[Lens (optics)|Optical lenses]] serve as an example of a practical application of the interface between [[glass]] and air.

One topical interface system is the gas-liquid interface between [[aerosols]] and other atmospheric molecules.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2774">The '''ion vibration current''' ('''IVI''') and the associated '''ion vibration potential''' is an [[electric]] signal that arises when an [[acoustic wave]] propagates through a [[Homogeneous (chemistry)|homogeneous]] fluid.

Historically, the IVI was the first known [[electroacoustic phenomena|electroacoustic phenomenon]]. It was predicted by [[Peter Debye]] in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Debye, P. |title=A method for the determination of the mass of electrolyte ions |journal=J. Chem. Phys. |volume=1 |page=13 |year=1933 |doi=10.1063/1.1749213|bibcode=1933JChPh...1...13D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a [[longitudinal wave|longitudinal]] [[sound wave]] travels through a solvent, the associated pressure gradients push the fluid particles back and forth, and it is easy in practice to create such accelerations that measure thousands or millions of [[g-force|g's]]. If a solute molecule is more dense or less dense than the surrounding liquid, then in this accelerating environment, the molecule will move relative to the surrounding liquid. This relative motion is essentially the same phenomenon that occurs in a [[centrifuge]], or more simply, it is essentially the same phenomenon that occurs when low-density objects float to the top of a glass of water, and high-density particles sink to the bottom (see the [[equivalence principle]], which states that gravity is just like any other acceleration). The amount of relative motion depends on the balance between the molecule's effective mass (which includes both the mass of the molecule itself and any solvent molecules that are so tightly bound to the molecule that they follow along with the molecule's motion), its effective volume (related to [[buoyant force]]), and the viscous drag (friction) between the molecule and the surrounding fluid.

IVI concerns the case where the particles in question are [[anion]]s and [[cation]]s. In general, they will have different amounts of motion relative to the fluid during the sound wave oscillations, and that discrepancy creates an alternating [[electric potential]] between various points in a [[sound wave]].

This effect was extensively used in the 1950s and 1960s for characterizing ion [[solvation]]. These works are mostly associated with the names of Zana and Yaeger, who published a review of their studies in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |authors=Zana, R. and Yeager, E. |title=Ultrasonic Vibration Potentials |journal=Mod.

Knowledge of the '''location of Earth''' has been shaped by 400 years of telescopic observations, and has expanded radically in the last century. Initially, Earth was believed to be the [[Geocentric model|center of the Universe]],  
which consisted only of those planets visible with the [[classical planet|naked eye]] and an outlying sphere of [[fixed stars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Thomas S. |last=Kuhn |title=The Copernican Revolution |pages=5–20 |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |date=1957 |isbn=978-0-674-17103-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the acceptance of the [[heliocentric model]] in the 17th century, observations by [[William Herschel]] and others showed that the Sun lay within a vast, disc-shaped [[galaxy]] of stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1781: William Herschel Reveals the Shape of our Galaxy|url=http://cosmology.carnegiescience.edu/timeline/1781|publisher=[[Carnegie Institution for Science]]|accessdate=19 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140326182039/http://cosmology.carnegiescience.edu/timeline/1781|archivedate=26 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 20th century, observations of [[spiral nebula]]e revealed that our galaxy was one of billions in an [[expanding universe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Spiral Nebulae and the Great Debate|publisher=[[Eberly College of Science]]|url=https://www.e-education.psu.edu/astro801/content/l9_p2.html|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1929: Edwin Hubble Discovers the Universe is Expanding|publisher=Carnegie Institution for Science|url=https://cosmology.carnegiescience.edu/timeline/1929|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; grouped into clusters and [[supercluster]]s. By the end of the 20th century, the [[large-scale structure of the cosmos|overall structure]] of the visible universe was becoming clearer, with superclusters forming into a vast web of [[galactic filament|filaments]] and [[Void (astronomy)|voids]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1989: Margaret Geller and John Huchra Map the Universe|publisher=[[Carnegie Institution for Science]]|url=https://cosmology.carnegiescience.edu/timeline/1989|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Superclusters, filaments and voids are the largest coherent structures in the Universe that we can observe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Structure of the Universe|author= Villanueva, John Carl |publisher=[[Universe Today]]|year=2009|url=http://www.universetoday.com/37360/structure-of-the-universe/|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At still larger scales (over 1000 [[megaparsec]]s{{efn|name=parsec|A parsec (pc) is the distance at which a star's [[parallax]] as viewed from Earth is equal to one [[second of arc]], equal to roughly 206,000&amp;nbsp;AU or 3.0857×10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;km.

A '''material''' is a [[chemical substance]] or [[mixture]] of substances that constitute an object. Materials can be pure or impure, a singular composite or a complex mix, living or non-living matter, whether natural or man-made, either concrete or abstract. Materials can be classified based on different properties such as [[physical property|physical]] and [[chemical property|chemical properties]] (see [[List of materials properties]]), [[geological]], [[biological]], choreographical, or [[property (philosophy)|philosophical properties]]. In the physical sense, materials are studied in the field of [[materials science]].

In [[industry]], materials are inputs to [[wiktionary:production|production]] or [[list of manufacturing processes|manufacturing processes]]. They may either be [[raw material]], that is, unprocessed, or processed before being used in more advanced production processes, either by [[distillation]] or [[Chemical synthesis|synthesis]] (synthetic materials).

Types of materials include:
*[[Biomaterial]], of biological origin
*[[Composite material]], composed of multiple materials with differing physical properties
*[[Textile]]s, sometimes referred to as "material"
*[[Genetic material]]

==Classification of materials==
Materials are classified according to many different criteria including their physical and chemical characteristics as well as their intended applications whether it is thermal, optical, electrical, magnetic, or combined. As their methods of usage dictate their physical appearance, they can be designed, tailored, and/or prepared in many forms such as powders, thin or thick films, and plates and could be introduced/studied in a single or multi layers. End products could be pure materials or doped ones with most useful compounds are those with controlled added impurities.The dopants could be added chemically or mixed and implanted physically. In case the impurities were added chemically, the dopants/co-dopants on substitutional/interstitial sites should be optimized and investigated thoroughly as well as any stresses instigated by their presence within the structure; whereas in the case of the physical mixing, the influence of the degree of heterogeneity of the prepared hybrid composites ought to be studied.The different physical and chemical preparation techniques can be used solely or combined including solid state synthesis, hydrothermal, sol-gel, precipitations and coprecipitations, spin coating, physical vapor deposition, and spray pyrolysis. Types of impurities along with their amounts are usually dictated by types of matrices to be added to, and their ability to maximize the desired products’ usefulness. Among the most commonly used characterization techniques are X-ray diffraction (XRD) either single crystal or powder, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), UV-Vis absorption Spectroscopy, Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR), and Photoluminescence spectrometry. In addition, it is usually considered of extreme importance to find theoretical models that can confirm and/or predict the experimental findings and assist in discussion, assignment, and the explanation of results and outcomes. Also, vision and room for future modification and development should always be pinpointed. Hence, one can classify the material as a smart one if its presence can serve multi purposes within the final product.

{{quantum mechanics}}
'''Matter waves''' are a central part of the theory of [[quantum mechanics]], being an example of [[wave–particle duality]]. All [[matter]] can exhibit [[wave]]-like behavior. For example, a beam of [[electron]]s can be [[diffraction|diffracted]] just like a beam of light or a water wave. The concept that matter behaves like a wave was proposed by [[Louis de Broglie]] ({{IPAc-en|d|ə|ˈ|b|r|ɔɪ}}) in 1924. It is also referred to as the ''de Broglie hypothesis''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Feynman|Feynman, R.]], ''[[QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter]]'', Penguin 1990 Edition, page 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Matter waves are referred to as ''de Broglie waves''.

The ''de Broglie wavelength'' is the [[wavelength]], {{math|''λ''}}, associated with a massive particle and is related to its [[momentum]], {{math|''p''}}, through the [[Planck constant]], {{math|''h''}}:
:&lt;math&gt; \lambda = \frac{h}{p}=\frac{h}{mv}.&lt;/math&gt;

Wave-like behavior of matter was first experimentally demonstrated by [[George Paget Thomson]]'s thin metal diffraction experiment,&lt;ref name=GPTdiff&gt;{{cite journal | author = Thomson, G. P. | title = Diffraction of Cathode Rays by a Thin Film | journal = Nature | volume = 119 | issue = 3007 | pages = 890 | year = 1927 | doi = 10.1038/119890a0 | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v119/n3007/pdf/119890a0.pdf | format = PDF |bibcode = 1927Natur.119Q.890T }}&lt;/ref&gt; and independently in the [[Davisson–Germer experiment]] both using electrons, and it has also been confirmed for other [[elementary particle]]s, neutral [[atom]]s and even [[molecule]]s. Recently, it was also found that investigating the elementary process of diffusion gives the theoretical evidence of the relation of matter wave, regardless of the photon energy.&lt;ref&gt;Okino, T. (2018) Quantum Effect on Elementary Process of Diffusion and Collective Motion of Brown Particles, Journal Modern Physics 9, pp. 1007-1028.&lt;/ref&gt; It is thus revealed that the relation of matter wave is now not a hypothesis but an actual equation relevant to a characteristic of micro particle. The wave-like behavior of matter is crucial to the modern theory of atomic  structure and [[particle physics]].

==Historical context==
At the end of the 19th century, light was thought to consist of waves of electromagnetic fields which propagated according to [[Maxwell's equations]], while matter was thought to consist of localized particles (See [[wave–particle duality#Brief history of wave and particle viewpoints|history of wave and particle viewpoints]]). In 1900, this division was exposed to doubt, when, investigating the theory of black body thermal radiation, [[Max Planck]] proposed that light is emitted in discrete quanta of energy. It was thoroughly challenged in 1905. Extending Planck's investigation in several ways, including its connection with the [[photoelectric effect]], [[Albert Einstein]] proposed that light is also propagated and absorbed in quanta. Light quanta are now called [[photon]]s. These quanta would have an energy given by the [[Planck–Einstein relation]]:
:&lt;math&gt;E=h\nu&lt;/math&gt;
and a momentum
:&lt;math&gt;p=\frac{E}{c}=\frac{h}{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''ν''}} (lowercase [[Nu (letter)|Greek letter nu]]) and {{math|''λ''}} (lowercase [[Lambda|Greek letter lambda]]) denote the frequency and wavelength of the light, {{math|''c''}} the speed of light, and {{math|''h''}} the [[Planck constant]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Albert Einstein|Einstein, A.]] (1917). Zur Quantentheorie der Strahlung, ''Physicalische Zeitschrift'' '''18''': 121–128. Translated in {{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the modern convention, frequency is symbolized by ''f'' as is done in the rest of this article. Einstein’s postulate was confirmed experimentally by [[Robert Andrews Millikan|Robert Millikan]] and [[Arthur Compton]] over the next two decades.

==The de Broglie hypothesis==
[[File:Propagation of a de broglie wave.svg|290px|"290px"|right|thumb|Propagation of '''de Broglie waves''' in 1d – real part of the [[complex number|complex]] amplitude is blue, imaginary part is green. The probability (shown as the color [[opacity (optics)|opacity]]) of finding the particle at a given point ''x'' is spread out like a waveform; there is no definite position of the particle. As the amplitude increases above zero the [[curvature]] decreases, so the amplitude decreases again, and vice versa. The result is an alternating amplitude: a wave. Top: [[plane wave]]. Bottom: [[wave packet]].]]
De Broglie, in his 1924 PhD thesis, proposed that just as light has both wave-like and particle-like properties, [[electron]]s also have wave-like properties. By rearranging the momentum equation stated in the above section, we find a relationship between the [[wavelength]], {{math|''λ''}} associated with an electron and its [[momentum]], {{math|''p''}}, through the [[Planck constant]], {{math|''h''}}:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \lambda = \frac{h}{p}.&lt;/math&gt;

The relationship is now known to hold for all types of matter: all matter exhibits properties of both particles and waves.

{{quote|When I conceived the first basic ideas of wave mechanics in 1923–24, I was guided by the aim to perform a real physical synthesis, valid for all particles, of the coexistence of the wave and of the corpuscular aspects that Einstein had introduced for photons in his theory of light quanta in 1905.|De Broglie&lt;ref&gt;Louis de Broglie [http://www.springerlink.com/content/n170347gr6h82147/ "The Reinterpretation of Wave Mechanics" Foundations of Physics, Vol. 1 No. 1 (1970)]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1926, [[Erwin Schrödinger]] published an [[Schrödinger equation|equation]] describing how a matter wave should evolve—the matter wave analogue of [[Maxwell's equations|Maxwell’s equations]]—and used it to derive the [[Emission spectrum|energy spectrum]] of [[hydrogen]].

==Experimental confirmation==
[[File:Wave-particle duality.gif|right|thumb|200px|Demonstration of a matter wave in diffraction of electrons]]

Matter waves were first experimentally confirmed to occur in [[George Paget Thomson]]'s cathode ray diffraction experiment&lt;ref name=GPTdiff/&gt; and the [[Davisson–Germer experiment|Davisson-Germer experiment]] for electrons, and the de Broglie hypothesis has been confirmed for other elementary particles. Furthermore, neutral atoms and even molecules have been shown to be wave-like.

In 1927 at Bell Labs, [[Clinton Davisson]] and [[Lester Germer]] [[Davisson–Germer experiment|fired]] slow-moving [[electron]]s at a [[crystal]]line [[nickel]] target. The angular dependence of the diffracted electron intensity was measured, and was determined to have the same [[diffraction|diffraction pattern]] as those predicted by [[William Lawrence Bragg|Bragg]] for [[x-ray]]s. At the same time George Paget Thomson at the University of Aberdeen was independently firing electrons at very thin metal foils to demonstrate the same effect.&lt;ref name=GPTdiff/&gt; Before the acceptance of the de Broglie hypothesis, diffraction was a property that was thought to be exhibited only by waves. Therefore, the presence of any [[diffraction]] effects by matter demonstrated the wave-like nature of matter. When the de Broglie wavelength was inserted into the [[Bragg's law|Bragg condition]], the observed diffraction pattern was predicted, thereby experimentally confirming the de Broglie hypothesis for electrons.&lt;ref&gt;Mauro Dardo, ''Nobel Laureates and Twentieth-Century Physics'', Cambridge University Press 2004, pp. 156–157&lt;/ref&gt;

This was a pivotal result in the development of [[quantum mechanics]]. Just as the [[photoelectric effect]] demonstrated the particle nature of light, the [[Davisson–Germer experiment]] showed the wave-nature of matter, and completed the theory of [[wave–particle duality]]. For [[physicist]]s this idea was important because it meant that not only could any particle exhibit wave characteristics, but that one could use [[wave equation]]s to describe phenomena in matter if one used the de Broglie wavelength.

===Molecules===
Recent experiments even confirm the relations for molecules and even [[macromolecule]]s that otherwise might be supposed too large to undergo quantum mechanical effects.

===Special relativity===
Using two formulas from [[special relativity]], one for the [[Momentum#Relativistic|relativistic momentum]] and one for the relativistic mass energy

:&lt;math&gt;E = m c^2 = \gamma m_0 c^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{p} = m\vec{v} = \gamma m_0 \vec{v} &lt;/math&gt;

allows the equations to be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}&amp;\lambda =\,\, \frac {h}{\gamma m_0v}\, =\, \frac {h}{m_0v}\,\,\,\, \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}\\
&amp; f = \frac{\gamma\,m_0c^2}{h} = \frac {m_0c^2}{h} \bigg/ \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;m_0&lt;/math&gt; denotes the particle's [[Invariant mass|rest mass]], &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; its [[velocity]], &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; the [[Lorentz factor]], and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; the [[speed of light]] in a vacuum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Stationary states |first=Alan |last=Holden |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=1971 |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-501497-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams, W.S.C. (2002). ''Introducing Special Relativity'', Taylor &amp; Francis, London, {{ISBN|0-415-27761-2}}, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;de Broglie, L. (1970). [http://www.springerlink.com/content/n170347gr6h82147/ The reinterpretation of wave mechanics, ''Foundations of Physics'' '''1'''(1): 5–15, p. 9.]&lt;/ref&gt; See below for details of the derivation of the de Broglie relations. Group velocity (equal to the particle's speed) should not be confused with [[phase velocity]] (equal to the product of the particle's frequency and its wavelength). In the case of a non-[[dispersion relation|dispersive medium]], they happen to be equal, but otherwise they are not.

====Group velocity====
[[Albert Einstein]] first explained the [[wave–particle duality]] of light in 1905.  [[Louis de Broglie]] hypothesized that any particle should also exhibit such a duality. The velocity of a particle, he concluded, should always equal the group velocity of the corresponding wave. The magnitude of the group velocity is equal to the particle's speed.

Both in relativistic and non-relativistic quantum physics, we can identify the group velocity of a particle's wave function with the particle velocity.  [[Quantum mechanics]] has very accurately demonstrated this hypothesis, and the relation has been shown explicitly for particles as large as [[molecule]]s.&lt;ref name="Arndt 680–682"/&gt;

De Broglie deduced that if the duality equations already known for light were the same for any particle, then his hypothesis would hold.  This means that

:&lt;math&gt;v_g = \frac{\partial \omega}{\partial k} = \frac{\partial (E/\hbar)}{\partial (p/\hbar)} = \frac{\partial E}{\partial p}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''E''}} is the total [[energy]] of the particle, {{math|''p''}} is its [[momentum]], {{math|''ħ''}} is the reduced Planck constant. For a free non-relativistic particle it follows that

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  v_g &amp;= \frac{\partial E}{\partial p} = \frac{\partial}{\partial p} \left( \frac{1}{2}\frac{p^2}{m} \right)\\
    &amp;= \frac{p}{m}\\
    &amp;= v
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''m''}} is the [[mass]] of the particle and {{math|''v''}} its velocity.

Also in [[special relativity]] we find that

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  v_g &amp;= \frac{\partial E}{\partial p} = \frac{\partial}{\partial p} \left( \sqrt{p^2c^2+m_0^2c^4} \right)\\
    &amp;= \frac{pc^2}{\sqrt{p^2c^2 + m_0^2c^4}}\\
    &amp;= \frac{pc^2}{E}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the rest mass of the particle and {{math|''c''}} is the [[speed of light]] in a vacuum. But (see below), using that the phase velocity is {{math|''v''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''E''/''p'' {{=}} ''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/''v''}}, therefore

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  v_g &amp;= \frac{pc^2}{E}\\
    &amp;= \frac{c^2}{v_p}\\
    &amp;= v
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''v''}} is the velocity of the particle regardless of wave behavior.

====Phase velocity====
In [[quantum mechanics]], particles also behave as waves with [[complex number|complex]] phases. The [[phase velocity]] is equal to the product of the frequency multiplied by the wavelength.

By the de Broglie hypothesis, we see that

:&lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm{p} = \frac{\omega}{k} = \frac{E/\hbar}{p/\hbar} = \frac{E}{p}. &lt;/math&gt;

Using [[special relativity|relativistic]] relations for energy and momentum, we have

:&lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm{p} = \frac{E}{p} = \frac{m c^2}{m v} = \frac{\gamma m_0 c^2}{\gamma m_0 v} = \frac{c^2}{v} = \frac{c}{\beta}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''E'' is the total energy of the particle (i.e. [[Invariant mass#Rest energy|rest energy]] plus [[kinetic energy]] in the [[Kinematics|kinematic]] sense), ''p'' the [[momentum]], &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; the [[Lorentz factor]], ''c'' the [[speed of light]], and β the speed as a fraction of ''c''. The variable ''v'' can either be taken to be the speed of the particle or the group velocity of the corresponding matter wave. Since the particle speed &lt;math&gt;v &lt; c &lt;/math&gt; for any particle that has mass (according to [[special relativity]]), the phase velocity of matter waves always exceeds ''c'', i.e.

:&lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm{p} &gt; c, \,&lt;/math&gt;

and as we can see, it approaches ''c'' when the particle speed is in the relativistic range. The [[Faster-than-light|superluminal]] phase velocity does not violate special relativity, because phase propagation carries no energy. See the article on ''[[Dispersion (optics)#Group and phase velocity|Dispersion (optics)]]'' for details.

===Four-vectors===
{{Main|Four-vector}}

Using four-vectors, the De Broglie relations form a single equation:

{{Equation box 1
|indent=:
|equation = &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P}= \hbar\mathbf{K}&lt;/math&gt;
}}

which is [[Inertial frame of reference|frame]]-independent.

Likewise, the relation between group/particle velocity and phase velocity is given in frame-independent form by:

{{Equation box 1
|indent=:
|equation = &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{K} = \left(\frac{\omega_o}{c^2}\right)\mathbf{U}&lt;/math&gt;
}}

where
:[[Four-momentum]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P} = \left(\frac{E}{c}, \vec{\mathbf{p}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

:[[Four-vector#Four-wavevector|Four-wavevector]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{K} = \left(\frac{\omega}{c}, \vec{\mathbf{k}} \right) = \left(\frac{\omega}{c}, \frac{\omega}{v_p}\mathbf{\hat{n}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

:[[Four-velocity]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{U} = \gamma(c,\vec{\mathbf{u}}) = \gamma(c,v_g \hat{\mathbf{n}}) &lt;/math&gt;

==Interpretations==
The physical reality underlying de Broglie waves is a subject of ongoing debate. Some theories treat either the particle or the wave aspect as its fundamental nature, seeking to explain the other as an [[Emergence|emergent property]]. Some, such as the [[hidden variable theory]], treat the wave and the particle as distinct entities. Yet others propose some intermediate entity that is neither quite wave nor quite particle but only appears as such when we measure one or the other property. The [[Copenhagen interpretation]] states that the nature of the underlying reality is unknowable and beyond the bounds of scientific inquiry.

Schrödinger's quantum mechanical waves are conceptually different from ordinary physical waves such as water or sound. Ordinary physical waves are characterized by undulating real-number 'displacements' of dimensioned physical variables at each point of ordinary physical space at each instant of time. Schrödinger's "waves" are characterized by the undulating value of a dimensionless complex number at each point of an abstract multi-dimensional space, for example of configuration space.

At the Fifth Solvay Conference in 1927, [[Max Born]] and [[Werner Heisenberg]] reported as follows:

{{quote|If one wishes to calculate the probabilities of excitation and ionization of atoms [M. Born, Zur Quantenmechanik der Stossvorgange, ''Z. f. Phys.'', '''37''' (1926), 863; [Quantenmechanik der Stossvorgange], ''ibid.'', '''38''' (1926), 803] then one must introduce the coordinates of the atomic electrons as variables on an equal footing with those of the colliding electron. The waves then propagate no longer in three-dimensional space but in multi-dimensional configuration space. From this one sees that the quantum mechanical waves are indeed something quite different from the light waves of the classical theory.&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Born|Born, M.]], [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg, W.]] (1928). Quantum mechanics, pp. 143–181 of ''Électrons et Photons: Rapports et Discussions du Cinquième Conseil de Physique, tenu à Bruxelles du 24 au 29 Octobre 1927, sous les Auspices de l'Institut International de Physique Solvay'', Gauthier-Villars, Paris, p. 166; this translation at p. 425 of Bacciagaluppi, G., Valentini, A. (2009), ''Quantum Theory at the Crossroads: Reconsidering the 1927 Solvay Conference'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge UK, {{ISBN|978-0-521-81421-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

At the same conference, [[Erwin Schrödinger]] reported likewise.

{{quote|Under [the name 'wave mechanics',] at present two theories are being carried on, which are indeed closely related but not identical. The first, which follows on directly from the famous doctoral thesis by L. de Broglie, concerns waves in three-dimensional space. Because of the strictly relativistic treatment that is adopted in this version from the outset, we shall refer to it as the ''four-dimensional'' wave mechanics. The other theory is more remote from Mr de Broglie's original ideas, insofar as it is based on a wave-like process in the space of ''position coordinates'' (''q''-space) of an arbitrary mechanical system.[Long footnote about manuscript not copied here.] We shall therefore call it the ''multi-dimensional'' wave mechanics. Of course this use of the ''q''-space is to be seen only as a mathematical tool, as it is often applied also in the old mechanics; ultimately, in this version also, the process to be described is one in space and time. In truth, however, a complete unification of the two conceptions has not yet been achieved. Anything over and above the motion of a single electron could be treated so far only in the ''multi''-dimensional version; also, this is the  one that provides the mathematical solution to the problems posed by the Heisenberg-Born matrix mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Erwin Schrödinger|Schrödinger, E.]] (1928). Wave mechanics, pp. 185–206 of ''Électrons et Photons: Rapports et Discussions du Cinquième Conseil de Physique, tenu à Bruxelles du 24 au 29 Octobre 1927, sous les Auspices de l'Institut International de Physique Solvay'', Gauthier-Villars, Paris, pp. 185–186; this translation at p. 447 of Bacciagaluppi, G., Valentini, A. (2009), ''Quantum Theory at the Crossroads: Reconsidering the 1927 Solvay Conference'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge UK, {{ISBN|978-0-521-81421-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1955, Heisenberg reiterated this:

{{quote|An important step forward was made by the work of Born [''Z. Phys.'', '''37''': 863, 1926 and '''38''': 803, 1926] in the summer of 1926. In this work, the wave in configuration space was interpreted as a probability wave, in order to explain collision processes on Schrödinger's theory. This hypothesis contained two important new features in comparison with that of [[Niels Bohr|Bohr]], [[Hans Kramers|Kramers]] and [[John C. Slater|Slater]]. The first of these was the assertion that, in considering "probability waves", we are concerned with processes not in ordinary three-dimensional space, but in an abstract configuration space (a fact which is, unfortunately, sometimes overlooked even today); the second was the recognition that the probability wave is related to an individual process.&lt;ref&gt;[[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg, W.]] (1955). The development of the interpretation of the quantum theory, pp. 12–29, in ''[[Niels Bohr]] and the Development of Physics: Essays dedicated to Niels Bohr on the occasion of his seventieth birthday'', edited by [[Wolfgang Pauli|W. Pauli]], with the assistance of [[Léon Rosenfeld|L. Rosenfeld]] and [[Victor Weisskopf|V. Weisskopf]], Pergamon Press, London, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It is mentioned above that the "displaced quantity" of the Schrödinger wave has values that are dimensionless complex numbers. One may ask what is the physical meaning of those numbers. According to Heisenberg, rather than being of some ordinary physical quantity such as, for example, Maxwell's electric field intensity, or mass density, the Schrödinger-wave packet's "displaced quantity" is probability amplitude. He wrote that instead of using the term 'wave packet', it is preferable to speak of a probability packet.&lt;ref&gt;[[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg, W.]] (1927). Über den anschlaulichen Inhalt der quantentheoretischen Kinematik und Mechanik, ''Z. Phys.'' '''43''': 172–198, translated by eds. [[John Archibald Wheeler|Wheeler, J.A.]], [[Wojciech Zurek|Zurek, W.H.]] (1983), at pp. 62–84 of ''Quantum Theory and Measurement'', Princeton University Press, Princeton NJ, p. 73. Also translated as 'The actual content of quantum theoretical kinematics and mechanics' [https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19840008978.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt; The probability amplitude supports calculation of probability of location or momentum of discrete particles. Heisenberg recites Duane's account of particle diffraction by probabilistic quantal translation momentum transfer, which allows, for example in Young's two-slit experiment, each diffracted particle probabilistically to pass discretely through a particular slit.&lt;ref&gt;[[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg, W.]] (1930). ''The Physical Principles of the Quantum Theory'', translated by C. Eckart, F. C. Hoyt, University of Chicago Press, Chicago IL, pp. 77–78.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus one does not need necessarily think of the matter wave, as it were, as 'composed of smeared matter'.

These ideas may be expressed in ordinary language as follows. In the account of ordinary physical waves, a 'point' refers to a position in ordinary physical space at an instant of time, at which there is specified a 'displacement' of some physical quantity. But in the account of quantum mechanics, a 'point' refers to a configuration of the system at an instant of time, every particle of the system being in a sense present in every 'point' of configuration space, each particle at such a 'point' being located possibly at a different position in ordinary physical space. There is no explicit definite indication that, at an instant, this particle is 'here' and that particle is 'there' in some separate 'location' in configuration space. This conceptual difference entails that, in contrast to de Broglie's pre-quantum mechanical wave description, the quantum mechanical probability packet description does not directly and explicitly express the Aristotelian idea, referred to by Newton, that causal efficacy propagates through ordinary space by contact, nor the Einsteinian idea that such propagation is no faster than light. In contrast, these ideas are so expressed in the classical wave account, through the [[Green's function]], though it is inadequate for the observed quantal phenomena.

==De Broglie's phase wave and periodic phenomenon==
De Broglie's thesis started from the hypothesis, "that to each portion of energy with a proper mass {{math|''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} one may associate a periodic phenomenon of the frequency {{math|''ν''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} , such that one finds: {{math|''hν''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} ''m''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The frequency {{math|''ν''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is to be measured, of course, in the rest frame of the energy packet. This hypothesis is the basis of our theory."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = de Broglie | first1 = L. | authorlink = Louis de Broglie | year = 1923 | title = Waves and quanta | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 112 | issue = 2815| page = 540 | doi=10.1038/112540a0| bibcode = 1923Natur.112..540D}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis de Broglie|de Broglie, L.]] (1924).

De Broglie followed his initial hypothesis of a periodic phenomenon, with frequency {{math|''ν''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;, associated with the energy packet. He used the special theory of relativity to find, in the frame of the observer of the electron energy packet that is moving with velocity &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;, that its frequency was apparently reduced to

:&lt;math&gt;f = \nu_0 \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}\,.&lt;/math&gt;
 
Then
:&lt;math&gt; \lambda f = E/p=v_\mathrm p\,.&lt;/math&gt;

using the same notation as above. The quantity &lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm p&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of what de Broglie called the "phase y wave". Its wavelength is &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; and frequency &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;. De Broglie reasoned that his hypothetical intrinsic particle periodic phenomenon is in phase with that phase wave. This was his basic matter wave conception. He noted, as above, that &lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm p &gt; c&lt;/math&gt;, and the phase wave does not transfer energy.&lt;ref name="Medicus"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bacciagaluppi, G., Valentini, A. (2009).

While the concept of waves being associated with matter is correct, de Broglie did not leap directly to the final understanding of quantum mechanics with no missteps. There are conceptual problems with the approach that de Broglie took in his thesis that he was not able to resolve, despite trying a number of different fundamental hypotheses in different papers published while working on, and shortly after publishing, his thesis.&lt;ref name="MacKinnon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Martins"&gt;{{cite web

These difficulties were resolved by [[Erwin Schrödinger]], who developed the wave mechanics approach, starting from a somewhat different basic hypothesis.

The '''maximum power principle''' or '''Lotka's principle'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tilley |first1=David Rogers |title=Howard T. Odum’s contribution to the laws of energy |journal=Ecological Modelling |date=2004 |volume=178 |pages=121–125 |doi=10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2003.12.032 |url=http://www.unicamp.br/fea/ortega/extensao/davidtilley-2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been proposed as the fourth [[Principles of energetics|principle of energetics]] in [[Open system (systems theory)|open system]] [[thermodynamics]], where an example of an open system is a biological cell. According to [[Howard T. Odum]], "The maximum power principle can be stated: During self-organization, system designs develop and prevail that maximize power intake, energy transformation, and those uses that reinforce production and efficiency."&lt;ref&gt;H.T. Odum 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;311&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Chen (2006) has located the origin of the statement of maximum power as a formal principle in a tentative proposal by [[Alfred J. Lotka]] (1922a, b). Lotka's statement sought to explain the Darwinian notion of evolution with reference to a physical principle. Lotka's work was subsequently developed by the [[systems ecology|systems ecologist]] [[Howard T. Odum]] in collaboration with the Chemical Engineer Richard C. Pinkerton, and later advanced by the Engineer [[Myron Tribus]].

While Lotka's work may have been a first attempt to formalise evolutionary thought in mathematical terms, it followed similar observations made by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] and [[Vito Volterra|Volterra]] and Ludwig [[Boltzmann]], for example, throughout the sometimes controversial history of natural philosophy.  In contemporary literature it is most commonly associated with the work of Howard T. Odum.

The significance of Odum's approach was given greater support during the 1970s, amid times of [[1973 oil crisis|oil crisis]], where, as Gilliland (1978, pp.&amp;nbsp;100) observed, there was an emerging need for a new method of analysing the importance and value of energy resources to economic and environmental production. A field known as [[energy analysis]], itself associated with [[net energy]] and [[EROEI]], arose to fulfill this analytic need. However, in energy analysis intractable theoretical and practical difficulties arose when using the [[energy unit]] to understand, a) the conversion among concentrated fuel types (or [[energy types]]), b)  the contribution of labour, and c) the contribution of the environment.

==Philosophy and theory==
Lotka said (1922b: 151): 
{{cquote|The principle of natural selection reveals itself as capable of yielding information which the first and second laws of thermodynamics are not competent to furnish. The two fundamental laws of thermodynamics are, of course, insufficient to determine the course of events in a physical system. They tell us that certain things cannot happen, but they do not tell us what does happen.}}

Gilliland noted that these difficulties in analysis in turn required some new theory to adequately explain the interactions and transactions of these different energies (different concentrations of fuels, labour and environmental forces). Gilliland (Gilliland 1978, p.&amp;nbsp;101) suggested that Odum's statement of the maximum power principle (H.T.Odum 1978, pp.&amp;nbsp;54–87) was, perhaps, an adequate expression of the requisite theory:
{{cquote|That theory, as it is expressed by the maximum power principle, addresses the empirical question of why systems of any type or size organize themselves into the patterns observed. Such a question assumes that physical laws govern system function. It does not assume, for example, that the system comprising economic production is driven by consumers; rather that the whole cycle of production-consumption is structured and driven by physical laws.}}

This theory Odum called maximum power theory. In order to formulate maximum power theory Gilliland observed that Odum had added another law (the maximum power principle) to the already well established laws of thermodynamics. In 1978 Gilliland wrote that Odum's new law had not yet been validated (Gilliland 1978, p.&amp;nbsp;101). Gilliland stated that in maximum power theory the [[second law efficiency]] of thermodynamics required an additional physical concept: "the concept of second law efficiency under maximum power" (Gilliland 1978, p.&amp;nbsp;101):

{{cquote|Neither the first or second law of thermodynamics include a measure of the rate at which energy transformations or processes occur. The concept of maximum power incorporates time into measures of energy transformations. It provides information about the rate at which one kind of energy is transformed into another as well as the efficiency of that transformation.}} 
     
In this way the concept of maximum power was being used as a principle to quantitatively describe the selective law of biological [[evolution]]. Perhaps H.T.Odum's most concise statement of this view was (1970, p.&amp;nbsp;62):

{{cquote|Lotka provided the theory of natural selection as a maximum power organizer; under competitive conditions systems are selected which use their energies in various structural-developing actions so as to maximize their use of available energies. By this theory systems of cycles which drain less energy lose out in comparative development. However Leopold and Langbein have shown that streams in developing erosion profiles, meander systems, and tributary networks disperse their potential energies more slowly than if their channels were more direct. These two statements might be harmonized by an optimum efficiency maximum power principle (Odum and Pinkerton 1955), which indicates that energies which are converted too rapidly into heat are not made available to the systems own use because they are not fed back through storages into useful pumping, but instead do random stirring of the environment.}}

The Odum–Pinkerton approach to Lotka's proposal was to apply [[Ohm's law]] – and the associated [[maximum power theorem]] (a result in [[electric power|electrical power]] systems) – to ecological systems. Odum and Pinkerton defined "power" in electronic terms as the rate of [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]], where Work is understood as a "[[Thermodynamic free energy|useful energy]] transformation". &lt;!-- (In electrical engineering and physics, "[[Power (physics)|power]]" is defined as the rate of doing work or consuming energy, without any distinction between "useful energy" and any other energy.) --&gt;The concept of maximum power can therefore be defined as the '''''maximum''' rate of '''useful''' energy transformation''. Hence the underlying philosophy aims to unify the theories and associated laws of electronic and thermodynamic systems with biological systems. This approach presupposed an [[Analogical models|analogical view]] which sees the world as an ecological-electronic-economic engine.

==Proposals for maximum power principle as 4th thermodynamic law==
{{quotation|It has been pointed out by [[Ludwig Boltzmann|Boltzmann]] that the fundamental object of contention in the life-struggle, in the evolution of the organic world, is available energy. In accord with this observation is the principle that, in the struggle for existence, the advantage must go to those organisms whose energy-capturing devices are most efficient in directing available energy into channels favorable to the preservation of the species.|A.J. Lotka 1922a, p. 147}}

{{quotation|...it seems to this author appropriate to unite the biological and physical traditions by giving the Darwinian principle of natural selection the citation as the ''fourth law of thermodynamics'', since it is the controlling principle in rate of heat generation and efficiency settings in irreversible biological processes.|H.T. Odum 1963, p. 437}}

{{quotation|...it may be time to recognize the maximum power principle as the fourth thermodynamic law as suggested by Lotka.|H.T. Odum 1994}}

==Definition in words==
{{cquote|The maximum power principle can be stated: During self-organization, system designs develop and prevail that maximize power intake, energy transformation, and those uses that reinforce production and efficiency. (H.T. Odum 1995, p. 311)}}

{{cquote|...the maximum power principle ... states that systems which maximize their flow of energy survive in competition. In other words, rather than merely accepting the fact that more energy per unit of time is transformed in a process which operates at maximum power, this principle says that systems organize and structure themselves naturally to maximize power. Systems regulate themselves according to the maximum power principle. Over time, the systems which maximize power are selected for whereas those that do not are selected against and eventually eliminated. ... Odum argues ... that the free market mechanisms of the economy effectively do the same thing for human systems and that our economic evolution to date is a product of that selection process. (Gilliland 1978, pp. 101–102)}}

Odum et al. viewed the [[maximum power theorem]] as a principle of '''power-efficiency reciprocity selection''' with wider application than just electronics. For example, Odum saw it in open systems operating on solar energy, like both photovoltaics and photosynthesis (1963, p.&amp;nbsp;438). Like the maximum power theorem, Odum's statement of the maximum power principle relies on the notion of 'matching', such that high-quality energy maximizes power by matching and amplifying energy (1994, pp.&amp;nbsp;262, 541): "in surviving designs a matching of high-quality energy with larger amounts of low-quality energy is likely to occur" (1994, p.&amp;nbsp;260). As with electronic circuits, the resultant rate of energy transformation will be at a maximum at an intermediate power efficiency. In 2006, T.T. Cai, C.L. Montague and J.S. Davis said that, "The maximum power principle is a potential guide to understanding the patterns and processes of ecosystem development and sustainability. The principle predicts the selective persistence of ecosystem designs that capture a previously untapped energy source." (2006, p.&amp;nbsp;317). In several texts H.T. Odum gave the [[Atwood machine]] as a practical example of the 'principle' of maximum power.

=== Mathematical definition ===
The mathematical definition given by H.T. Odum is formally analogous to the definition provided on the [[maximum power theorem]] article. (For a brief explanation of Odum's approach to the relationship between ecology and electronics see [[Howard T. Odum#Ecological analog of Ohm.27s Law|Ecological Analog of Ohm's Law]])

==Contemporary ideas==
Whether or not the principle of maximum power efficiency can be considered the fourth law of thermodynamics and the fourth principle of energetics is moot. Nevertheless, H.T. Odum also proposed a corollary of maximum power as the organisational principle of evolution, describing the evolution of [[microbiological]] systems, [[economic systems]], [[planet]]ary systems, and [[astrophysical]] systems. He called this corollary the '''[[Maximum empower#Empower and maximum empower|maximum empower]]''' principle.  This was suggested because, as S.E. Jorgensen, M.T. Brown, H.T. Odum (2004) note,

{{quotation|Maximum power might be misunderstood to mean giving priority to low level processes. ... However, the higher level transformation processes are just as important as the low level processes. ... Therefore, Lotka's principle is clarified by stating it as the principle of self organization for maximum ''empower''. |p. 18}}

C. Giannantoni may have confused matters when he wrote "The "Maximum Em-Power Principle" (Lotka–Odum) is generally considered the "Fourth Thermodynamic Principle" (mainly) because of its practical validity for a very wide class of physical and biological systems" (C. Giannantoni 2002, § 13, p.&amp;nbsp;155). Nevertheless,  Giannantoni has proposed the Maximum Em-Power Principle as the fourth principle of thermodynamics (Giannantoni 2006).

The preceding discussion is incomplete. The "maximum power" was discovered several times independently, in physics and engineering, see: Novikov (1957), El-Wakil (1962), and Curzon and Ahlborn (1975). The incorrectness of this analysis and design evolution conclusions was demonstrated by Gyftopoulos (2002).

'''Moisture expansion''' is the tendency of matter to change in volume in response to a change in moisture content. The macroscopic effect is similar to that of [[thermal expansion]] but the microscopic causes are very different. Moisture expansion is caused by [[hygroscopy]].

A '''molecule''' is an [[electrically]] neutral group of two or more [[atom]]s held together by [[chemical bond]]s.&lt;ref name="iupac"&gt;{{GoldBookRef| title=Molecule|file=M04002|accessdate=23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author= Ebbin, Darrell D.| title= General Chemistry |edition=3rd| date= 1990| publisher= [[Houghton Mifflin Co.]]| location= Boston| isbn= 0-395-43302-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author= Brown, T.L. |author2=Kenneth C.

However, in [[quantum physics]], [[organic chemistry]], and [[biochemistry]], the term ''molecule'' is often used less strictly, also being applied to [[polyatomic ion]]s.

In the [[kinetic theory of gases]], the term ''molecule'' is often used for any gaseous [[particle]] regardless of its composition. According to this definition, [[noble gas]] atoms are considered molecules as they are monatomic molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last= Chandra| first= Sulekh| title= Comprehensive Inorganic Chemistry| date= 2005| publisher= New Age Publishers| isbn= 81-224-1512-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A molecule may be [[homonuclear]], that is, it consists of atoms of one [[chemical element]], as with [[oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;); or it may be [[heteronuclear]], a [[chemical compound]] composed of more than one element, as with [[water (molecule)|water]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O). Atoms and complexes connected by [[non-covalent interactions]], such as [[hydrogen bond]]s or [[ionic bond]]s, are generally not considered single molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title= Molecule|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|date =22 January 2016|url=http://global.britannica.com/science/molecule|access-date=23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Molecules as components of matter are common in organic substances (and therefore biochemistry). They also make up most of the oceans and atmosphere. However, the majority of familiar solid substances on Earth, including most of the minerals that make up the [[Crust (geology)|crust]], [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]], and [[Earth core|core of the Earth]], contain many chemical bonds, but are ''not'' made of identifiable molecules. Also, no typical molecule can be defined for [[ionic crystal]]s ([[salt (chemistry)|salts]]) and covalent crystals ([[network solid]]s), although these are often composed of repeating [[unit cell]]s that extend either in a [[Plane (mathematics)|plane]] (such as in [[graphene]]) or three-dimensionally (such as in [[diamond]], [[quartz]], or [[sodium chloride]]). The theme of repeated unit-cellular-structure also holds for most condensed phases with [[metallic bond]]ing, which means that solid metals are also not made of molecules. In [[glass]]es (solids that exist in a vitreous disordered state), atoms may also be held together by chemical bonds with no presence of any definable molecule, nor any of the regularity of repeating units that characterizes crystals.

== Molecular science ==

The science of molecules is called ''molecular chemistry'' or ''[[molecular physics]]'', depending on whether the focus is on chemistry or physics. Molecular chemistry deals with the laws governing the interaction between molecules that results in the formation and breakage of [[chemical bond]]s, while molecular physics deals with the laws governing their structure and properties. In practice, however, this distinction is vague. In molecular sciences, a molecule consists of a stable system ([[bound state]]) composed of two or more [[atom]]s. [[Polyatomic ion]]s may sometimes be usefully thought of as electrically charged molecules. The term ''unstable molecule'' is used for very [[reactivity (chemistry)|reactive]] species, i.e., short-lived assemblies ([[Resonance (chemistry)|resonances]]) of electrons and [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]], such as [[radical (chemistry)|radicals]], molecular [[ion]]s, [[Rydberg molecule]]s, [[transition state]]s, [[van der Waals bonding|van der Waals complexes]], or systems of colliding atoms as in [[Bose–Einstein condensate]].

== History and etymology ==
{{Main|History of molecular theory}}

According to [[Merriam-Webster]] and the [[Online Etymology Dictionary]], the word "molecule" derives from the [[Latin]] "[[Mole (unit)|moles]]" or small unit of mass.
* '''Molecule''' (1794)&amp;nbsp;– "extremely minute particle", from French ''{{linktext|molécule}}'' (1678), from [[New Latin]] ''{{linktext|molecula}}'', diminutive of Latin ''{{linktext|moles}}'' "mass, barrier". A vague meaning at first; the vogue for the word (used until the late 18th century only in Latin form) can be traced to the philosophy of [[René Descartes|Descartes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|molecule|accessdate=2016-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=molecule|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/molecule|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]]|accessdate=22 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition of the molecule has evolved as knowledge of the structure of molecules has increased. Earlier definitions were less precise, defining molecules as the smallest [[list of particles#Molecules|particles]] of pure [[chemical substance]]s that still retain their [[chemical compound|composition]] and chemical properties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://antoine.frostburg.edu/chem/senese/101/glossary/m.shtml#molecule Molecule Definition] ([[Frostburg State University]])&lt;/ref&gt; This definition often breaks down since many substances in ordinary experience, such as [[rock (geology)|rocks]], [[salt (chemistry)|salts]], and [[metal]]s, are composed of large crystalline networks of [[chemical bond|chemically bonded]] atoms or [[ion]]s, but are not made of discrete molecules.

== Bonding ==

Molecules are held together by either [[covalent bonding]] or [[ionic bonding]]. Several types of non-metal elements exist only as molecules in the environment. For example, hydrogen only exists as hydrogen molecule. A molecule of a compound is made out of two or more elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Hutchinson unabridged encyclopedia with atlas and weather guide|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/hutchinson-unabridged-encyclopedia-with-atlas-and-weather-guide/oclc/696918830|website=worldcat.org|publisher=Oxford, England|accessdate=28 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Covalent ===
{{main|Covalent bonding}}
[[File:Covalent bond hydrogen.svg|thumb|right|A covalent bond forming H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (right) where two [[hydrogen atom]]s share the two electrons]]
A covalent bond is a [[chemical bond]] that involves the sharing of [[electron pair]]s between [[atom]]s. These electron pairs are termed ''shared pairs'' or ''bonding pairs'', and the stable balance of attractive and repulsive forces between atoms, when they share electrons, is termed ''covalent bonding''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author2= Brad Williamson; Robin J. Heyden| last= Campbell| first= Neil A.| title= Biology: Exploring Life| url= http://www.phschool.com/el_marketing.html| accessdate= 2012-02-05| year= 2006| publisher= [[Pearson Prentice Hall]]| location= Boston, Massachusetts| isbn= 0-13-250882-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{clear}}

=== Ionic ===
{{main|Ionic bonding}} [[File:NaF.gif|thumb|left|[[Sodium]] and [[fluorine]] undergoing a redox reaction to form [[sodium fluoride]]. Sodium loses its outer [[electron]]  to give it a stable [[electron configuration]], and this electron enters the fluorine atom [[exothermic]]ally.]]

Ionic bonding is a type of [[chemical bond]] that involves the [[electrostatic]] attraction between oppositely charged [[ion]]s, and is the primary interaction occurring in [[ionic compound]]s. The ions are atoms that have lost one or more [[electron]]s (termed [[cation]]s) and atoms that have gained one or more electrons (termed [[anion]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6VdROgeQ5M8C&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=ionic+bonding+-wikipedia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi34bOG_6nTAhVnl1QKHRLZBeoQ6AEILTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=ionic%20bonding%20-wikipedia&amp;f=false|title=Elements of Metallurgy and Engineering Alloys|last=Campbell|first=Flake C.|date=2008-01-01|publisher=[[ASM International]]|isbn=9781615030583|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This transfer of electrons is termed ''electrovalence'' in contrast to [[covalent bond|covalence]]. In the simplest case, the cation is a [[metal]] atom and the anion is a [[nonmetal]] atom, but these ions can be of a more complicated nature, e.g. molecular ions like NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; or SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;. Basically, an ionic bond is the transfer of electrons from a metal to a non-metal for both atoms to obtain a full valence shell.

== Molecular size ==

Most molecules are far too small to be seen with the naked eye, but there are exceptions. [[DNA]], a [[macromolecule]], can reach [[macroscopic]] sizes, as can molecules of many [[polymer]]s. Molecules commonly used as building blocks for organic synthesis have a dimension of a few [[angstrom]]s (Å) to several dozen Å, or around one billionth of a meter. Single molecules cannot usually be observed by [[light]] (as noted above), but small molecules and even the outlines of individual atoms may be traced in some circumstances by use of an [[atomic force microscope]]. Some of the largest molecules are [[macromolecule]]s or [[supermolecule]]s.

The smallest molecule is the [[diatomic]] [[hydrogen]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), with a bond length of 0.74 Å.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author= Roger L. DeKock |author2=Harry B.

== Molecular formulas ==

=== Chemical formula types ===
{{Main|Chemical formula}}

The [[chemical formula]] for a molecule uses one line of [[chemical element]] symbols, numbers, and sometimes also other symbols, such as parentheses, dashes, brackets, and ''plus'' (+) and ''minus'' (−) signs. These are limited to one typographic line of symbols, which may include subscripts and superscripts.

A compound's [[empirical formula]] is a very simple type of chemical formula.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6wUmteTIc18C&amp;pg=PA288&amp;dq=empirical+formula&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiv64bBh6rTAhUSwmMKHb3vB0IQ6AEIOjAF#v=onepage&amp;q=empirical%20formula&amp;f=false|title=The Practice of Chemistry|last=Wink|first=Donald J.|last2=Fetzer-Gislason|first2=Sharon|last3=McNicholas|first3=Sheila|date=2003-03-01|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=9780716748717|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the simplest [[integer]] [[ratio]] of the [[chemical element]]s that constitute it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chemteam.info/Mole/EmpiricalFormula.html|title=ChemTeam: Empirical Formula|website=www.chemteam.info|access-date=2017-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, water is always composed of a 2:1 ratio of [[hydrogen]] to [[oxygen]] atoms, and ethyl [[alcohol]] or [[ethanol]] is always composed of [[carbon]], [[hydrogen]], and [[oxygen]] in a 2:6:1 ratio. However, this does not determine the kind of molecule uniquely&amp;nbsp;– [[dimethyl ether]] has the same ratios as ethanol, for instance. Molecules with the same [[atom]]s in different arrangements are called [[isomer]]s. Also carbohydrates, for example, have the same ratio (carbon:hydrogen:oxygen= 1:2:1) (and thus the same empirical formula) but different total numbers of atoms in the molecule.

The [[molecular formula]] reflects the exact number of atoms that compose the molecule and so characterizes different molecules. However different isomers can have the same atomic composition while being different molecules.

The empirical formula is often the same as the molecular formula but not always. For example, the molecule [[acetylene]] has molecular formula C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, but the simplest integer ratio of elements is CH.

The [[molecular mass]] can be calculated from the [[chemical formula]] and is expressed in conventional [[atomic mass unit]]s equal to 1/12 of the mass of a neutral carbon-12 (&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;[[carbon|C]] [[isotope]]) atom. For [[network solid]]s, the term [[formula unit]] is used in [[stoichiometric]] calculations.

[[File:Atisane3.png|thumb|right|upright=1.8|[[Three-dimensional space|3D]] (left and center) and [[2D geometric model|2D]] (right) representations of the [[terpenoid]] molecule atisane]]

For molecules with a complicated 3-dimensional structure, especially involving atoms bonded to four different substituents, a simple molecular formula or even semi-structural [[chemical formula]] may not be enough to completely specify the molecule. In this case, a graphical type of formula called a [[structural formula]] may be needed. Structural formulas may in turn be represented with a one-dimensional chemical name, but such [[chemical nomenclature]] requires many words and terms which are not part of chemical formulas.

== Molecular geometry ==
{{Main|Molecular geometry}}

[[File:Cyanostar STM.png|thumb|left|upright|Structure and [[Scanning tunneling microscopy|STM]] image of a "cyanostar" [[dendrimer]] molecule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1039/C4CC03725A|pmid=25080328|title=Anion-induced dimerization of 5-fold symmetric cyanostars in 3D crystalline solids and 2D self-assembled crystals|journal=Chemical Communications|volume=50|issue=69|pages=9827–30|year=2014|last1=Hirsch|first1=Brandon E.|last2=Lee|first2=Semin|last3=Qiao|first3=Bo|last4=Chen|first4=Chun-Hsing|last5=McDonald|first5=Kevin P.|last6=Tait|first6=Steven L.|last7=Flood|first7=Amar H.}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Molecules have fixed [[mechanical equilibrium|equilibrium]] geometries—bond lengths and angles— about which they continuously oscillate through vibrational and rotational motions. A pure substance is composed of molecules with the same average geometrical structure. The chemical formula and the structure of a molecule are the two important factors that determine its properties, particularly its [[reactivity (chemistry)|reactivity]]. [[Isomers]] share a chemical formula but normally have very different properties because of their different structures. [[Stereoisomer]]s, a particular type of isomer, may have very similar physico-chemical properties and at the same time different [[biochemistry|biochemical]] activities.

== Molecular spectroscopy ==
{{Main|Spectroscopy}}

[[File:Dehydrogenation of H2TPP by STM.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Hydrogen can be removed from individual [[Tetraphenylporphyrin|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TPP]] molecules by applying excess voltage to the tip of a [[scanning tunneling microscope]] (STM, a); this removal alters the current-voltage (I-V) curves of TPP molecules, measured using the same STM tip, from [[diode]] like (red curve in b) to [[resistor]] like (green curve). Image (c) shows a row of TPP, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TPP and TPP molecules. While scanning image (d), excess voltage was applied to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TPP at the black dot, which instantly removed hydrogen, as shown in the bottom part of (d) and in the rescan image (e). Such manipulations can be used in [[single-molecule electronics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/srep08350|pmid=25666850|pmc=4322354|title=N and p type character of single molecule diodes|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=5|page=8350|year=2015|bibcode= 2015NatSR...5E8350Z|author1=Zoldan|first1=V. C.|last2=Faccio|first2=R|last3=Pasa|first3=A. A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Molecular spectroscopy''' deals with the response ([[frequency spectrum|spectrum]]) of molecules interacting with probing signals of known [[energy]] (or [[frequency]], according to [[Planck's constant|Planck's formula]]). Molecules have quantized energy levels that can be analyzed by detecting the molecule's energy exchange through [[absorbance]] or [[Emission (electromagnetic radiation)|emission]].&lt;ref name="iupac2"&gt;{{GoldBookRef|title=Spectroscopy|file=S05848|accessdate=23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Spectroscopy does not generally refer to [[diffraction]] studies where particles such as [[neutron]]s, [[electron]]s, or high energy [[X-ray]]s interact with a regular arrangement of molecules (as in a crystal).

[[Microwave spectroscopy]] commonly measures changes in the rotation of molecules, and can be used to identify molecules in outer space. [[Infrared spectroscopy]] measures changes in vibration of molecules, including stretching, bending or twisting motions. It is commonly used to identify the kinds of bonds or [[functional group]]s in molecules. Changes in the arrangements of electrons yield absorption or emission lines in ultraviolet, visible or [[near infrared]] light, and result in colour. Nuclear resonance spectroscopy actually measures the environment of particular nuclei in the molecule, and can be used to characterise the numbers of atoms in different positions in a molecule.

== Theoretical aspects ==

The study of molecules by [[molecular physics]] and [[theoretical chemistry]] is largely based on [[quantum mechanic]]s and is essential for the understanding of the [[chemical bond]]. The simplest of molecules is the [[hydrogen molecule-ion]], H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, and the simplest of all the chemical bonds is the [[one-electron bond]]. H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is composed of two positively charged [[proton]]s and one negatively charged [[electron]], which means that the [[Schrödinger equation]] for the system can be solved more easily due to the lack of electron–electron repulsion. With the development of fast digital computers, approximate solutions for more complicated molecules became possible and are one of the main aspects of [[computational chemistry]].

When trying to define rigorously whether an arrangement of atoms is ''sufficiently stable'' to be considered a molecule, IUPAC suggests that it "must correspond to a depression on the [[potential energy surface]] that is deep enough to confine at least one vibrational state".&lt;ref name="iupac" /&gt; This definition does not depend on the nature of the interaction between the atoms, but only on the strength of the interaction. In fact, it includes weakly bound species that would not traditionally be considered molecules, such as the [[helium]] [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimer]], [[helium dimer|He&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], which has one vibrational [[bound state]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Anderson JB |title=Comment on "An exact quantum Monte Carlo calculation of the helium-helium intermolecular potential" [J. Chem. Phys. 115, 4546 (2001)] |journal=J Chem Phys |volume=120 |issue=20 |pages=9886–7 |date=May 2004 |pmid=15268005 |doi=10.1063/1.1704638 |bibcode= 2004JChPh.120.9886A}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is so loosely bound that it is only likely to be observed at very low temperatures.

Whether or not an arrangement of atoms is ''sufficiently stable'' to be considered a molecule is inherently an operational definition. Philosophically, therefore, a molecule is not a fundamental entity (in contrast, for instance, to an [[elementary particle]]); rather, the concept of a molecule is the chemist's way of making a useful statement about the strengths of atomic-scale interactions in the world that we observe.

The '''Orapa Power Station''' is a [[Peaking power plant|Peak load power generation plant]] located in the mining town of [[Orapa]] in northeastern [[Botswana]] in the [[Central District (Botswana)|Central District]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mmegi.bw/index.php?sid=4&amp;aid=587&amp;dir=2011/October/Monday10/|title=Mmegi Online :: Orapa power plant to be finally launched|work=Mmegi Online|access-date=2018-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is built within the [[Debswana|Debswana Diamond Company Ltd]] [[Orapa diamond mine]] [[lease|fenced leased area]] and is operated by the [[Botswana Power Corporation]].


==Background==
The plant construction was initiated when [[Botswana]] started experiencing electricity supply challenges from year '''2007''' when demand for electricity in the [[country]] started exceeding the county's electricity generation capacity leading to forced periodic nation wide [[Rolling_blackout|load shedding]] excises by the [[Botswana Power Corporation]]. The plant was a short term response to the mining industry electricity requirements&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mmegi.bw/index.php?sid=4&amp;aid=5796&amp;dir=2010/October/Friday22 Developers of Orapa's 90MW push for 60 % cost reduction]&lt;/ref&gt; prior to the development of Mmamabula and Morupule B power stations.

The plant site is located next to an [[electrical substation]] through which it connects to the [[Electrical grid|national grid]] and was designed to use either [[natural gas]] or [[Diesel_fuel|diesel]] as [[fuel]]. It was commissioned using [[Diesel_fuel|diesel]] with a planned conversion to [[natural gas]] once construction of a [[Pipeline transport|gas pipeline]] from nearby [[Coalbed methane|gas fields]] was complete and commissioned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sundaystandard.info/kalahari-energy-convert-diesel-orapa-power-plant-cbm-operation Kalahari Energy to convert diesel Orapa Power Plant to CBM operation]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specifications==
The plant consists of two 45MW [[GE LM6000]] Sprint [[Simple_cycle_combustion_turbine|Simple Cycle]] [[gas turbines]] fueled using [[Diesel_fuel|diesel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sundaystandard.info/bpc-gets-orapa-90mw-power-station|title=BPC gets Orapa 90MW Power Station {{!}} Sunday Standard|website=www.sundaystandard.info|access-date=2018-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The energy produced is transferred to the [[Electrical grid|national grid]] via the interconnected Orapa Substation by use of two short [[Electric power transmission|132kV overhead power lines]].

[[File:Earth's atmosphere.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|The interface between the Earth's surface and outer space. The [[Kármán line]] at an altitude of {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} is shown. The layers of [[atmosphere of Earth|the atmosphere]] are drawn to scale, whereas objects within them, such as the [[International Space Station]], are not.]]

'''Outer space''', or just '''space''', is the expanse that exists beyond the [[Earth]] and between [[Astronomical object|celestial bodies]]. Outer space is not completely empty—it is a [[hard vacuum]] containing a low density of particles, predominantly a [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] of [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]] as well as [[electromagnetic radiation]], [[magnetic field]]s, [[cosmic neutrino background|neutrinos]], [[cosmic dust|dust]], and [[cosmic ray]]s. The baseline [[temperature]], as set by the [[cosmic background radiation|background radiation]] from the [[Big Bang]], is {{Convert|2.7|K|C F|abbr=out}}.&lt;ref name="CBE2008" /&gt; The [[Warm–hot intergalactic medium|plasma between galaxies]] accounts for about half of the [[baryonic matter|baryonic (ordinary) matter]] in the universe; it has a [[number density]] of less than one [[hydrogen atom]] per [[cubic metre]] and a temperature of millions of kelvins;&lt;ref name=baas41_908/&gt; local concentrations of this plasma have condensed into [[star]]s and [[galaxy|galaxies]]. Studies indicate that 90% of the mass in most galaxies is in an unknown form, called [[dark matter]], which interacts with other matter through [[gravitation]]al but not [[electromagnetic force]]s.{{sfn|Freedman|Kaufmann|2005|pp=573, 599–601}}&lt;ref name="Trimble 1987" /&gt; Observations suggest that the majority of the [[Mass–energy equivalence|mass-energy]] in the [[observable universe]] is a poorly understood [[vacuum energy]] of space, which astronomers label ''[[dark energy]]''.&lt;ref name="nasa_darkenergy" /&gt;{{sfn|Freedman|Kaufmann|2005|pp=650–653}} Intergalactic space takes up most of the volume of the [[Universe]], but even galaxies and [[star system]]s consist almost entirely of empty space.

Outer space does not begin at a definite altitude above the Earth's surface. However, the [[Kármán line]], an altitude of {{Convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} above sea level,{{sfn|O'Leary|2009|p=84}}&lt;ref name=space_begin/&gt; is conventionally used as the start of outer space in space treaties and for aerospace records keeping. The framework for international [[space law]] was established by the [[Outer Space Treaty]], which entered into force on 10 October 1967. This treaty precludes any claims of [[national sovereignty]] and permits all states to freely [[space exploration|explore outer space]]. Despite the drafting of [[UN resolution]]s for the peaceful uses of outer space, [[anti-satellite weapon]]s have been tested in Earth orbit.

Humans began the physical exploration of space during the 20th century with the advent of high-altitude [[Balloon (aircraft)|balloon flights]], followed by manned [[rocket launch]]es. [[Earth orbit]] was first achieved by [[Yuri Gagarin]] of the Soviet Union in 1961, and [[unmanned spacecraft]] have since reached all of the known [[planet]]s in the [[Solar System]]. Due to the high cost of getting into space, manned [[spaceflight]] has been limited to low Earth orbit and the [[Moon]].

Outer space represents a challenging environment for human exploration because of the hazards of vacuum and [[radiation]]. [[Microgravity]] also has a negative effect on human [[physiology]] that causes both [[muscle atrophy]] and [[Spaceflight osteopenia|bone loss]]. In addition to these health and environmental issues, the economic cost of putting objects, including humans, into space is very high.

== Discovery ==
In 350 BCE, Greek philosopher [[Aristotle]] suggested that ''nature abhors a vacuum'', a principle that became known as the ''[[Horror vacui (physics)|horror vacui]]''. This concept built upon a 5th-century BCE [[Ontology|ontological]] argument by the Greek philosopher [[Parmenides]], who denied the possible existence of a void in space.{{sfn|Grant|1981|p=10}} Based on this idea that a vacuum could not exist, in the [[Western culture|West]] it was widely held for many centuries that space could not be empty.{{sfn|Porter|Park|Daston|2006|p=27}} As late as the 17th century, the French philosopher [[René Descartes]] argued that the entirety of space must be filled.{{sfn|Eckert|2006|p=5}}

In [[ancient China]], the 2nd-century astronomer [[Zhang Heng]] became convinced that space must be infinite, extending well beyond the mechanism that supported the Sun and the stars. The surviving books of the Hsüan Yeh school said that the heavens were boundless, "empty and void of substance". Likewise, the "sun, moon, and the company of stars float in the empty space, moving or standing still".{{sfn|Needham|Ronan|1985|pp=82–87}}

The Italian scientist [[Galileo Galilei]] knew that air had mass and so was subject to gravity. In 1640, he demonstrated that an established force resisted the formation of a vacuum. However, it would remain for his pupil [[Evangelista Torricelli]] to create an apparatus that would produce a partial vacuum in 1643. This experiment resulted in the first mercury [[barometer]] and created a scientific sensation in Europe. The French mathematician [[Blaise Pascal]] reasoned that if the column of mercury was supported by air, then the column ought to be shorter at higher altitude where the [[air pressure]] is lower.{{sfn|Holton|Brush|2001|pp=267–268}} In 1648, his brother-in-law, Florin Périer, repeated the experiment on the [[Puy de Dôme]] mountain in central France and found that the column was shorter by three inches. This decrease in pressure was further demonstrated by carrying a half-full balloon up a mountain and watching it gradually expand, then contract upon descent.{{sfn|Cajori|1917|pp=64–66}}

[[File:Magedurger Halbkugeln Luftpumpe Deutsches Museum.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The original [[Magdeburg hemispheres]] (lower left) used to demonstrate Otto von Guericke's vacuum pump (right)|alt=A glass display case holds a mechanical device with a lever arm, plus two metal hemispheres attached to draw ropes]]

In 1650, German scientist [[Otto von Guericke]] constructed the first vacuum pump: a device that would further refute the principle of ''horror vacui''. He correctly noted that the atmosphere of the Earth surrounds the planet like a shell, with the [[density]] gradually declining with altitude. He concluded that there must be a vacuum between the Earth and the Moon.{{sfn|Genz|2001|pp=127–128}}

Back in the 15th century, German theologian [[Nicolaus Cusanus]] speculated that the [[Universe]] lacked a center and a circumference. He believed that the Universe, while not infinite, could not be held as finite as it lacked any bounds within which it could be contained.{{sfn|Tassoul|Tassoul|2004|p=22}} These ideas led to speculations as to the infinite dimension of space by the Italian philosopher [[Giordano Bruno]] in the 16th century. He extended the Copernican [[heliocentric]] [[cosmology]] to the concept of an infinite Universe filled with a substance he called [[Aether (classical element)|aether]], which did not resist the motion of heavenly bodies.{{sfn|Gatti|2002|pp=99–104}} English philosopher [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]] arrived at a similar conclusion, arguing that the stars are visible to us only because they are surrounded by a thin aether or a void.{{sfn|Kelly|1965|pp=97–107}} This concept of an aether originated with [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] philosophers, including Aristotle, who conceived of it as the medium through which the heavenly bodies move.{{sfn|Olenick|Apostol|Goodstein|1986|p=356}}

The concept of a Universe filled with a [[luminiferous aether]] remained in vogue among some scientists until the early 20th century. This form of aether was viewed as the medium through which light could propagate.{{sfn|Hariharan|2003|p=2}} In 1887, the [[Michelson–Morley experiment]] tried to detect the Earth's motion through this medium by looking for changes in the [[speed of light]] depending on the direction of the planet's motion. However, the [[null result]] indicated something was wrong with the concept. The idea of the luminiferous aether was then abandoned. It was replaced by [[Albert Einstein]]'s theory of [[special relativity]], which holds that the speed of light in a vacuum is a fixed constant, independent of the observer's motion or [[frame of reference]].{{sfn|Olenick|Apostol|Goodstein|1986|pp=357–365}}{{sfn|Thagard|1992|pp=206–209}}

The first professional [[astronomer]] to support the concept of an infinite Universe was the Englishman [[Thomas Digges]] in 1576.{{sfn|Maor|1991|p=195}} But the scale of the Universe remained unknown until the first successful measurement of the distance to a nearby star in 1838 by the German astronomer [[Friedrich Bessel]]. He showed that the star [[61 Cygni]] had a [[stellar parallax|parallax]] of just 0.31&amp;nbsp;[[arcsecond]]s (compared to the modern value of 0.287″). This corresponds to a distance of over 10 [[light year]]s.{{sfn|Webb|1999|pp=71–73}} In 1917, [[Heber Doust Curtis|Heber Curtis]] noted that [[nova]]e in spiral nebulae were, on average, 10 magnitudes fainter than galactic novae, suggesting that the former are 100 times further away.&lt;ref name=Curtis1988/&gt; The distance to the [[Andromeda Galaxy]] was determined in 1923 by American astronomer [[Edwin Hubble]] by measuring the brightness of [[cepheid variable]]s in that galaxy, a new technique discovered by [[Henrietta Leavitt]].&lt;ref name=csiro_20041025/&gt; This established that the Andromeda galaxy, and by extension all galaxies, lay well outside the [[Milky Way]].{{sfn|Tyson|Goldsmith|2004|pp=114–115}}

The earliest known estimate of the temperature of outer space was by the Swiss physicist [[Charles Édouard Guillaume|Charles É. Guillaume]] in 1896. Using the estimated radiation of the background stars, he concluded that space must be heated to a temperature of 5–6&amp;nbsp;K. British physicist [[Arthur Eddington]] made a similar calculation to derive a temperature of 3.18&amp;nbsp;K in 1926. German physicist [[Erich Regener]] used the total measured energy of [[cosmic ray]]s to estimate an intergalactic temperature of 2.8&amp;nbsp;K in 1933.&lt;ref name="Apeiron2_3_79"/&gt;

The modern concept of outer space is based on the [[Big Bang cosmology|"Big Bang" cosmology]], first proposed in 1931 by the Belgian physicist [[Georges Lemaître]].&lt;ref name=nature127_3210_706/&gt; This theory holds that the universe originated from a very dense form that has since undergone continuous [[Hubble's law|expansion]]. The background energy released during the initial expansion has steadily decreased in density, leading to a 1948 prediction by American physicists [[Ralph Alpher]] and [[Robert Herman]] of a temperature of 5&amp;nbsp;K for the temperature of space.&lt;ref name="Apeiron2_3_79"/&gt;

The term ''outward space'' was used in 1842 by the English poet Lady [[Emmeline Stuart-Wortley]] in her poem "The Maiden of Moscow".{{sfn|Stuart Wortley|1841|p=410}} The expression ''outer space'' was used as an astronomical term by [[Alexander von Humboldt]] in 1845.{{sfn|Von Humboldt|1845|p=39}} It was later popularized in the writings of [[H. G. Wells]] in 1901.&lt;ref name="entymonline"/&gt; The shorter term ''space'' is older, first used to mean the region beyond Earth's sky in [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' in 1667.&lt;ref name=harper2001/&gt;

== Formation and state ==
[[File:CMB Timeline300 no WMAP.jpg|upright=1.4|thumb|This is an artist's concept of the [[metric expansion of space]], where a volume of the Universe is represented at each time interval by the circular sections. At left is depicted the rapid [[Inflationary epoch|inflation]] from the initial state, followed thereafter by steady expansion to the present day, shown at right.]]
{{Main|Big Bang}}
According to the Big Bang theory, the very early Universe was an extremely hot and dense state about [[age of the universe|13.8 billion years ago]]&lt;ref name=planck_2013 /&gt; which rapidly [[Metric expansion of space|expanded]]. About 380,000 years later the Universe had cooled sufficiently to allow protons and electrons to combine and form hydrogen—the so-called [[Recombination (cosmology)|recombination epoch]]. When this happened, matter and energy became decoupled, allowing photons to travel freely through the continually expanding space.&lt;ref name="SciAm301_1_36"/&gt; Matter that remained following the initial expansion has since undergone gravitational collapse to create [[star]]s, [[galaxy|galaxies]] and other [[astronomical object]]s, leaving behind a deep vacuum that forms what is now called outer space.{{sfn|Silk|2000|pp=105–308}} As light has a finite velocity, this theory also constrains the size of the directly observable universe.&lt;ref name="SciAm301_1_36"/&gt; This leaves open the question as to whether the Universe is finite or infinite.

The present day [[shape of the universe]] has been determined from measurements of the [[Cosmic microwave background radiation|cosmic microwave background]] using satellites like the [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe]]. These observations indicate that the [[spatial geometry]] of the observable universe is "[[Flatness (cosmology)|flat]]", meaning that photons on parallel paths at one point remain parallel as they travel through space to the limit of the observable universe, except for local gravity.&lt;ref name="WMAP"/&gt; The flat Universe, combined with the measured mass density of the Universe and the accelerating [[Hubble's law|expansion of the Universe]], indicates that space has a non-zero [[vacuum energy]], which is called [[dark energy]].{{sfn|Sparke|Gallagher|2007|pp=329–330}}

Estimates put the average energy density of the present day Universe at the equivalent of 5.9 protons per cubic meter, including dark energy, [[dark matter]], and [[baryonic matter]] (ordinary matter composed of atoms). The atoms account for only 4.6% of the total energy density, or a density of one proton per four cubic meters.&lt;ref name=nasa_wmap/&gt; The density of the Universe, however, is clearly not uniform; it ranges from relatively high density in galaxies—including very high density in structures within galaxies, such as planets, stars, and [[black hole]]s—to conditions in vast [[Void (astronomy)|voids]] that have much lower density, at least in terms of visible matter.&lt;ref name=aj89_1461/&gt; Unlike matter and dark matter, dark energy seems not to be concentrated in galaxies: although dark energy may account for a majority of the mass-energy in the Universe, dark energy's influence is 5 [[Order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]] smaller than the influence of gravity from matter and dark matter within the Milky Way.&lt;ref name=rvmphys_75_559 /&gt;

== Environment ==

Given the finite [[speed of light]], this view covers the past {{nowrap|13 billion years}} of the [[Chronology of the universe|history]] of outer space.|alt=A black background with luminous shapes of various sizes scattered randomly about. They typically have white, red or blue hues.]]
Outer space is the closest known approximation to a [[perfect vacuum]]. It has effectively no [[friction]], allowing stars, [[planets]], and [[moons]] to move freely along their ideal [[orbit]]s, following the [[Planetary formation|initial formation]] stage. However, even the deep vacuum of [[Outer space#Intergalactic|intergalactic space]] is not devoid of [[matter]], as it contains a few [[hydrogen atoms]] per cubic meter.&lt;ref name=pasj20_230/&gt; By comparison, the air humans breathe contains about 10&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt; molecules per cubic meter.{{sfn|Borowitz|Beiser|1971}}&lt;ref name=patrick/&gt; The low density of matter in outer space means that [[electromagnetic radiation]] can travel great distances without being scattered: the [[mean free path]] of a [[photon]] in intergalactic space is about 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;km, or 10 billion light years.{{sfn|Davies|1977|p=93}} In spite of this, [[Extinction (astronomy)|extinction]], which is the [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] and [[scattering]] of photons by dust and gas, is an important factor in galactic and intergalactic [[astronomy]].&lt;ref name=fitzpatrick2004/&gt;

Stars, planets, and moons retain their [[atmosphere]]s by gravitational attraction. Atmospheres have no clearly delineated upper boundary: the density of atmospheric gas gradually decreases with distance from the object until it becomes indistinguishable from outer space.{{sfn|Chamberlain|1978|p=2}} The Earth's atmospheric [[pressure]] drops to about {{nowrap|0.032 }}[[Pascal (unit)|Pa]] at {{Convert|100|km|mi|abbr=off}} of altitude,&lt;ref name=squire2000/&gt; compared to 100,000 Pa for the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC) definition of [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|standard pressure]]. Above this altitude, isotropic gas pressure rapidly becomes insignificant when compared to [[radiation pressure]] from the [[Sun]] and the [[dynamic pressure]] of the [[solar wind]]. The [[thermosphere]] in this range has large gradients of pressure, temperature and composition, and varies greatly due to [[space weather]].&lt;ref name=jmsj_85B_193/&gt;

The temperature of outer space is measured in terms of the [[kinetic theory of gases|kinetic]] activity of the gas, as it is on Earth. However, the radiation of outer space has a different temperature than the kinetic temperature of the gas, meaning that the gas and radiation are not in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]].{{sfn|Prialnik|2000|pp=195–196}}{{sfn|Spitzer|1978|p=28–30}} All of the observable universe is filled with photons that were created during the [[Big Bang]], which is known as the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] (CMB). (There is quite likely a correspondingly large number of [[neutrino]]s called the [[cosmic neutrino background]].&lt;ref name="fp2_30"/&gt;) The current [[black body]] temperature of the background radiation is about {{convert|3|K|C F|0|lk=on}}.&lt;ref name=apj707_2_916/&gt; The gas temperatures in outer space are always at least the temperature of the CMB but can be much higher. For example, the [[corona]] of the Sun reaches temperatures over 1.2–2.6&amp;nbsp;million&amp;nbsp;K.&lt;ref name=apj325_442/&gt;

Magnetic fields have been detected in the space around just about every class of celestial object. Star formation in spiral galaxies can generate small-scale [[dynamo]]s, creating turbulent magnetic field strengths of around 5–10&amp;nbsp;μ[[Gauss (unit)|G]]. The [[Davis–Greenstein effect]] causes elongated [[Cosmic dust|dust grains]] to align themselves with a galaxy's magnetic field, resulting in weak optical [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]]. This has been used to show ordered magnetic fields exist in several nearby galaxies. [[Magnetohydrodynamics|Magneto-hydrodynamic]] processes in [[Active galactic nucleus|active]] [[Elliptical galaxy|elliptical galaxies]] produce their characteristic [[Astrophysical jet|jets]] and [[radio lobe]]s. Non-thermal [[Astronomical radio source|radio sources]] have been detected even among the most distant, [[redshift|high-z]] sources, indicating the presence of magnetic fields.&lt;ref name=WielebinskiBeck2010/&gt;

Outside a protective atmosphere and magnetic field, there are few obstacles to the passage through space of energetic [[subatomic particle]]s known as cosmic rays. These particles have energies ranging from about 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[Electronvolt|eV]] up to an extreme 10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;eV of [[ultra-high-energy cosmic ray]]s.&lt;ref name=rmp83_3_907/&gt; The peak flux of cosmic rays occurs at energies of about 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;eV, with approximately 87% protons, 12% helium nuclei and 1% heavier nuclei. In the high energy range, the flux of [[electron]]s is only about 1% of that of protons.{{sfn|Lang|1999|p=462}} Cosmic rays can damage electronic components and pose a [[Health threat from cosmic rays|health threat]] to space travelers.{{sfn|Lide|1993|p=11{{hyphen}}217&lt;!-- Note: this is not a page range --&gt;}} According to astronauts, like [[Don Pettit]], space has a burned/metallic odor that clings to their suits and equipment, similar to the scent of an [[arc welding]] torch.&lt;ref name=ls2012/&gt;&lt;ref name="PopSicSmell"/&gt;

Despite the harsh environment, several life forms have been found that can withstand extreme space conditions for extended periods. Species of lichen carried on the ESA [[BIOPAN]] facility survived exposure for ten days in 2007.&lt;ref name="Astrobiology_11_4_281"/&gt; Seeds of ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' and ''[[Nicotiana tabacum]]'' germinated after being exposed to space for 1.5 years.&lt;ref name="Astrobiology_12_5_517"/&gt; A strain of ''[[bacillus subtilis]]'' has survived 559 days when exposed to low-Earth orbit or a simulated martian environment.&lt;ref name="Astrobiology_12_5_498"/&gt; The [[Panspermia|lithopanspermia]] hypothesis suggests that rocks ejected into outer space from life-harboring planets may successfully transport life forms to another habitable world. A conjecture is that just such a scenario occurred early in the history of the Solar System, with potentially [[microorganism]]-bearing rocks being exchanged between Venus, Earth, and Mars.&lt;ref name="Nicholson2010"/&gt;

=== Effect on human bodies ===

Even at relatively low altitudes in the Earth's atmosphere, conditions are hostile to the human body. The altitude where atmospheric pressure matches the [[vapor pressure of water]] at the [[Human body temperature|temperature of the human body]] is called the [[Armstrong line]], named after American physician [[Harry G. Armstrong]]. It is located at an altitude of around {{convert|19.14|km|mi|abbr=on}}. At or above the Armstrong line, fluids in the throat and lungs boil away. More specifically, exposed bodily liquids such as saliva, tears, and liquids in the lungs boil away. Hence, at this altitude, human survival requires a pressure suit, or a pressurized capsule.{{sfn|Piantadosi|2003|pp=188–189}}

Once in space, sudden exposure of unprotected humans to very low [[Atmospheric pressure|pressure]], such as during a rapid decompression, can cause [[pulmonary barotrauma]]—a rupture of the lungs, due to the large pressure differential between inside and outside the chest.&lt;ref name=ajeas2_4_573/&gt; Even if the subject's airway is fully open, the flow of air through the windpipe may be too slow to prevent the rupture.&lt;ref name=krebs_pilmanis1996/&gt; Rapid decompression can rupture eardrums and sinuses, bruising and blood seep can occur in soft tissues, and shock can cause an increase in oxygen consumption that leads to [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]].&lt;ref name=ajeas2_4_573/&gt;

As a consequence of rapid decompression, [[oxygen]] dissolved in the blood empties into the lungs to try to equalize the [[partial pressure]] gradient. Once the deoxygenated blood arrives at the brain, humans lose consciousness after a few seconds and die of hypoxia within minutes.&lt;ref name=bmj286/&gt; Blood and other body fluids boil when the pressure drops below 6.3&amp;nbsp;kPa, and this condition is called [[ebullism]].&lt;ref name=jramc157_1_85/&gt; The steam may bloat the body to twice its normal size and slow circulation, but tissues are elastic and porous enough to prevent rupture. Ebullism is slowed by the pressure containment of blood vessels, so some blood remains liquid.{{sfn|Billings|1973|pp=1–34}}&lt;ref name=landis20070807/&gt; Swelling and ebullism can be reduced by containment in a [[pressure suit]]. The Crew Altitude Protection Suit (CAPS), a fitted elastic garment designed in the 1960s for astronauts, prevents ebullism at pressures as low as 2 kPa.&lt;ref name=am39_376/&gt; Supplemental oxygen is needed at {{Convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}} to provide enough oxygen for breathing and to prevent water loss, while above {{Convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} pressure suits are essential to prevent ebullism.{{sfn|Ellery|2000|p=68}} Most space suits use around 30–39&amp;nbsp;kPa of pure oxygen, about the same as on the Earth's surface. This pressure is high enough to prevent ebullism, but evaporation of nitrogen dissolved in the blood could still cause [[decompression sickness]] and [[air embolism|gas embolisms]] if not managed.{{sfn|Davis|Johnson|Stepanek|2008|pp=270–271}}

[[Human evolution|Humans evolved]] for life in Earth [[Gravitation|gravity]], and exposure to weightlessness has been shown to have deleterious effects on human health. Initially, more than 50% of astronauts experience [[space motion sickness]]. This can cause [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]], [[Vertigo (medical)|vertigo]], headaches, [[lethargy]], and overall malaise. The duration of space sickness varies, but it typically lasts for 1–3 days, after which the body adjusts to the new environment. Longer-term exposure to weightlessness results in [[muscle atrophy]] and deterioration of the [[Human skeleton|skeleton]], or [[spaceflight osteopenia]]. These effects can be minimized through a regimen of exercise.&lt;ref name=spp22_15/&gt; Other effects include fluid redistribution, slowing of the [[cardiovascular system]], decreased production of [[red blood cell]]s, balance disorders, and a weakening of the [[immune system]]. Lesser symptoms include loss of body mass, nasal congestion, sleep disturbance, and puffiness of the face.&lt;ref name=cmaj180_13_1317/&gt;

For long-duration space travel, radiation can pose an [[acute health hazard]].
Exposure to high-energy, ionizing [[cosmic rays]] can result in fatigue, nausea, vomiting, as well as damage to the immune system and changes to the [[white blood cell]] count. Over longer durations, symptoms include an increased risk of [[cancer]], plus damage to the [[Human eye|eyes]], [[nervous system]], [[Human lung|lungs]] and the [[Human gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal tract]].&lt;ref name=nsbri_radiation/&gt; On a round-trip [[Mars]] mission lasting three years, a large fraction of the cells in an astronaut's body would be traversed and potentially damaged by high energy nuclei.&lt;ref name=curtis_and_Letaw/&gt; The energy of such particles is significantly diminished by the shielding provided by the walls of a spacecraft and can be further diminished by water containers and other barriers. However, the impact of the cosmic rays upon the shielding produces additional radiation that can affect the crew. Further research is needed to assess the radiation hazards and determine suitable countermeasures.&lt;ref name=sas4_11_1013/&gt;

There is no clear boundary between [[Earth's atmosphere]] and space, as the density of the atmosphere gradually decreases as the altitude increases. There are several standard boundary designations, namely:
* The [[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale]] has established the [[Kármán line]] at an altitude of {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} as a working definition for the boundary between aeronautics and astronautics. This is used because at an altitude of about {{Convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}}, as [[Theodore von Kármán]] calculated, a vehicle would have to travel faster than [[Orbital speed|orbital velocity]] to derive sufficient [[aerodynamic lift]] from the atmosphere to support itself.{{sfn|O'Leary|2009|p=84}}&lt;ref name=space_begin/&gt;
* The United States designates people who travel above an altitude of {{convert|50|mi|km}} as [[astronaut]]s.{{sfn|Wong|Fergusson|2010|p=16}}
* [[NASA]]'s Space Shuttle used 400,000 feet (76&amp;nbsp;mi, 122&amp;nbsp;km) as its [[atmospheric reentry|re-entry]] altitude (termed the Entry Interface), which roughly marks the boundary where [[atmospheric drag]] becomes noticeable, thus beginning the process of switching from steering with thrusters to maneuvering with aerodynamic control surfaces.&lt;ref name=petty20030213/&gt;

In 2009, scientists reported detailed measurements with a Supra-Thermal Ion Imager (an instrument that measures the direction and speed of ions), which allowed them to establish a boundary at {{Convert|118|km|mi|abbr=on}} above Earth. The boundary represents the midpoint of a gradual transition over tens of kilometers from the relatively gentle winds of the Earth's atmosphere to the more violent flows of charged particles in space, which can reach speeds well over {{Convert|268|m/s|mph|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=thompton20090409/&gt;&lt;ref name=jgr114/&gt;

The [[Outer Space Treaty]] provides the basic framework for international space law. It covers the legal use of outer space by nation states, and includes in its definition of ''outer space'' the Moon and other celestial bodies. The treaty states that outer space is free for all nation states to explore and is not subject to claims of national [[sovereignty]]. It also prohibits the deployment of [[nuclear weapon]]s in outer space. The treaty was passed by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in 1963 and signed in 1967 by the USSR, the United States of America and the United Kingdom. As of 2017, 105 state parties have either ratified or acceded to the treaty. An additional 25 states signed the treaty, without ratifying it.&lt;ref name="unoosa2" /&gt;.&lt;ref name=unoosa/&gt;

Since 1958, outer space has been the subject of multiple United Nations resolutions. Of these, more than 50 have been concerning the international co-operation in the peaceful uses of outer space and preventing an arms race in space.&lt;ref name=garros/&gt; Four additional [[space law]] treaties have been negotiated and drafted by the UN's [[United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space|Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space]]. Still, there remains no legal prohibition against deploying conventional weapons in space, and [[anti-satellite weapon]]s have been successfully tested by the US, USSR and China.{{sfn|Wong|Fergusson|2010|p=4}} The 1979 [[Moon Treaty]] turned the jurisdiction of all heavenly bodies (including the orbits around such bodies) over to the international community. However, this treaty has not been ratified by any nation that currently practices manned spaceflight.&lt;ref name=esf20071105/&gt;

In 1976, eight equatorial states ([[Ecuador]], [[Colombia]], [[Brazil]], [[Republic of the Congo|Congo]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Zaire]], [[Uganda]], [[Kenya]], and [[Indonesia]]) met in [[Bogotá]], Colombia. With their "Declaration of the First Meeting of Equatorial Countries", or "the Bogotá Declaration", they claimed control of the segment of the geosynchronous orbital path corresponding to each country.&lt;ref name=bogota1976/&gt; These claims are not internationally accepted.&lt;ref name=aasl31_2006/&gt;

== Earth orbit ==
A spacecraft enters orbit when its [[Centripetal force|centripetal]] [[acceleration]] due to [[Gravitation|gravity]] is less than or equal to the [[centrifugal force|centrifugal]] acceleration due to the horizontal component of its velocity. For a [[low Earth orbit]], this velocity is about {{Convert|7800|m/s|km/h mph|-2|abbr=on}};&lt;ref name=hill1999/&gt; by contrast, the fastest manned airplane speed ever achieved (excluding speeds achieved by deorbiting spacecraft) was {{Convert|2200|m/s|km/h mph|-2|abbr=on}} in 1967 by the [[North American X-15]].&lt;ref name=shiner20071101/&gt;

To achieve an orbit, a [[spacecraft]] must travel faster than a [[sub-orbital spaceflight]]. The energy required to reach Earth orbital velocity at an altitude of {{Convert|600|km|mi|abbr=on}} is about 36&amp;nbsp;[[Megajoule|MJ]]/kg, which is six times the energy needed merely to climb to the corresponding altitude.&lt;ref name=dimotakis1999/&gt; Spacecraft with a [[Apsis|perigee]] below about {{Convert|2,000|km|mi|abbr=on}} are subject to drag from the Earth's atmosphere,{{sfn|Ghosh|2000|pp=47–48}} which decreases the orbital altitude. The rate of orbital decay depends on the satellite's cross-sectional area and mass, as well as variations in the air density of the upper atmosphere. Below about {{Convert|300|km|mi|abbr=on}}, decay becomes more rapid with lifetimes measured in days. Once a satellite descends to {{Convert|180|km|mi|abbr=on}}, it has only hours before it vaporizes in the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=slsa/&gt; The [[escape velocity]] required to pull free of Earth's gravitational field altogether and move into interplanetary space is about {{Convert|11200|m/s|km/h mph|-2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=williams2010/&gt;

== Regions ==
Space is a partial vacuum: its different regions are defined by the various atmospheres and "winds" that dominate within them, and extend to the point at which those winds give way to those beyond. Geospace extends from Earth's atmosphere to the outer reaches of Earth's magnetic field, whereupon it gives way to the solar wind of interplanetary space.{{sfn|Schrijver|Siscoe|2010|p=363}} Interplanetary space extends to the heliopause, whereupon the solar wind gives way to the winds of the [[interstellar medium]].&lt;ref name=universetoday_interplanetaryspace /&gt; Interstellar space then continues to the edges of the galaxy, where it fades into the intergalactic void.&lt;ref name=jpl_interstellarspace /&gt;

=== Geospace ===
[[File:Aurora-SpaceShuttle-EO.jpg|thumb|right|[[Aurora (astronomy)|Aurora australis]] observed from the [[Space Shuttle]] ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', on [[STS-39]], May 1991 (orbital altitude: 260 km)|alt=The lower half is the blue-white planet in low illumination. Nebulous red streamers climb upward from the limb of the disk toward the black sky. The Space Shuttle is visible along the left edge.]]

[[wikt:geospace|Geospace]] is the region of outer space near Earth, including the upper atmosphere and [[magnetosphere]].{{sfn|Schrijver|Siscoe|2010|p=363}} The [[Van Allen radiation belt]]s lie within the geospace. The outer boundary of geospace is the [[magnetopause]], which forms an interface between the Earth's magnetosphere and the solar wind. The inner boundary is the [[ionosphere]].&lt;ref name=geospace/&gt; The variable space-weather conditions of geospace are affected by the behavior of the Sun and the solar wind; the subject of geospace is interlinked with [[heliophysics]] -- the study of the Sun and its impact on the planets of the Solar System.{{sfn|Fichtner|Liu|2011|pp=341–345}}

The day-side magnetopause is compressed by solar-wind pressure -- the subsolar distance from the center of the Earth is typically 10 Earth radii. On the night side, the solar wind stretches the magnetosphere to form a [[magnetotail]] that sometimes extends out to more than 100–200 Earth radii.{{sfn|Koskinen|2010|pp=32, 42}}&lt;ref name=HonesJr1986/&gt; For roughly four days of each month, the lunar surface is shielded from the solar wind as the Moon passes through the magnetotail.{{sfn|Mendillo|2000|p=275}}

Geospace is populated by electrically charged particles at very low densities, the motions of which are controlled by the [[Earth's magnetic field]]. These plasmas form a medium from which storm-like disturbances powered by the solar wind can drive electrical currents into the Earth's upper atmosphere. [[Geomagnetic storm]]s can disturb two regions of geospace, the radiation belts and the ionosphere. These storms increase fluxes of energetic electrons that can permanently damage satellite electronics, interfering with shortwave radio communication and [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] location and timing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Space Weather &amp; Telecommunications |first=John M. |last=Goodman |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |year=2006 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4465qvHUZusC&amp;pg=PA244&amp;dq=effect+space+weather+shortwave+gps&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwis_6eZ88rXAhVCx1QKHcYaB4kQ6AEIODAD#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Magnetic storms can also be a hazard to astronauts, even in low Earth orbit. They also create [[aurora (astronomy)|aurorae]] seen at high latitudes in an oval surrounding the [[geomagnetic pole]]s.&lt;ref name=oecd/&gt;

Although it meets the definition of outer space, the atmospheric density within the first few hundred kilometers above the Kármán line is still sufficient to produce significant [[Drag (physics)|drag]] on [[satellite]]s.&lt;ref name=slsa/&gt; This region contains material left over from previous manned and unmanned launches that are a potential hazard to spacecraft. Some of this [[space debris|debris]] re-enters Earth's atmosphere periodically.&lt;ref name=portree_loftus1999/&gt;

====Cislunar space====
[[File:Artist%27s concept of Cislunar Spacecraft Configuration.jpg|right|thumb|Proposed spacecraft for manned cislunar travel in the [[2020s in spaceflight|2020s]]]]

[[gravity of Earth|Earth's gravity]] keeps the [[Moon]] in orbit at an [[lunar distance (astronomy)|average distance]] of {{cvt|384403|km|mi}}. The region outside [[atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]] and extending out to just beyond the [[orbit of the Moon|Moon's orbit]], including the [[Lagrangian point]]s, is sometimes referred to as '''cislunar space'''.&lt;ref name=sr2165/&gt;

The region of space where Earth's gravity remains dominant against gravitational [[perturbation (astronomy)|perturbations]] from the Sun is called the [[Hill sphere]].&lt;ref name=yoder1995/&gt; This extends well out into translunar space to a distance of roughly 1% of the mean distance from Earth to the Sun,{{sfn|Barbieri|2006|p=253}} or {{convert|1.5|e6km|e6mi|abbr=unit}}.

'''Deep space''' has different definitions as to where it starts. It has been defined by the United States government and others as any region beyond cislunar space.{{sfn|Dickson|2010|p=57}}{{sfn|United States|p=536}}{{sfn|Williamson|2006|p=97}}&lt;ref name=Collins/&gt; The [[ITU-R|International Telecommunication Union responsible for radio communication]] (including satellites) defines the beginning of deep space at about 5 times that distance ({{Val|2e6|u=km}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://life.itu.int/radioclub/rr/art1.pdf |title=ITU-R Radio Regulations, Article 1, Terms and definitions, Section VIII, Technical terms relating to space, paragraph 1.177. |publisher=International Telecommunication Union |accessdate=2018-02-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Interplanetary space ===
{{main|Interplanetary medium}}
[[File:Comet Hale-Bopp 1995O1.jpg|right|thumb|The sparse plasma (blue) and dust (white) in the tail of [[comet Hale–Bopp]] are being shaped by pressure from [[Sunlight|solar radiation]] and the solar wind, respectively|alt=At lower left, a white coma stands out against a black background. Nebulous material streams away to the top and left, slowly fading with distance.]]
Interplanetary space is defined by the solar wind, a continuous stream of charged particles emanating from the Sun that creates a very tenuous atmosphere (the [[heliosphere]]) for billions of kilometers into space. This wind has a particle density of 5–10 [[proton]]s/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and is moving at a velocity of {{Convert|350|-|400|km/s|mph|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Papagiannis|1972|pp=12–149}} Interplanetary space extends out to the [[Astropause|heliopause]] where the influence of the galactic environment starts to dominate over the magnetic field and particle flux from the Sun.&lt;ref name=universetoday_interplanetaryspace /&gt; The distance and strength of the heliopause varies depending on the activity level of the solar wind.&lt;ref name=phillips2009/&gt;

The volume of interplanetary space is a nearly total vacuum, with a mean free path of about one [[astronomical unit]] at the orbital distance of the Earth. However, this space is not completely empty, and is sparsely filled with cosmic rays, which include [[ion]]ized [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] and various subatomic particles. There is also gas, [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] and dust, small [[meteor]]s, and several dozen types of [[organic chemistry|organic]] [[molecule]]s discovered to date by [[rotational spectroscopy|microwave spectroscopy]].&lt;ref name=asp2003/&gt; A cloud of interplanetary dust is visible at night as a faint band called the [[zodiacal light]].&lt;ref name="leinert_grun_1990"/&gt;

Interplanetary space contains the magnetic field generated by the Sun.{{sfn|Papagiannis|1972|pp=12–149}} There are also magnetospheres generated by planets such as Jupiter, Saturn, Mercury and the Earth that have their own magnetic fields. These are shaped by the influence of the solar wind into the approximation of a teardrop shape, with the long tail extending outward behind the planet. These magnetic fields can trap particles from the solar wind and other sources, creating belts of charged particles such as the Van Allen radiation belts. Planets without magnetic fields, such as Mars, have their atmospheres gradually eroded by the solar wind.&lt;ref name=ssr69_3_215/&gt;

=== Interstellar space ===

Interstellar space is the physical space within a galaxy beyond the influence each star has upon the encompassed plasma.&lt;ref name=jpl_interstellarspace /&gt; The contents of interstellar space are called the interstellar medium. Approximately 70% of the mass of the interstellar medium consists of lone hydrogen atoms; most of the remainder consists of helium atoms. This is enriched with trace amounts of heavier atoms formed through [[stellar nucleosynthesis]]. These atoms are ejected into the interstellar medium by [[stellar wind]]s or when evolved stars begin to shed their outer envelopes such as during the formation of a [[planetary nebula]].&lt;ref name="Ferrière2001"/&gt; The cataclysmic explosion of a [[supernova]] generates an expanding [[shock wave]] consisting of ejected materials that further enrich the medium.&lt;ref name="witt2001"/&gt; The density of matter in the interstellar medium can vary considerably: the average is around 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; particles per m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;,&lt;ref name=Boulares1990/&gt; but cold [[molecular clouds]] can hold 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;–10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; per m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.{{sfn|Prialnik|2000|pp=195–196}}&lt;ref name="Ferrière2001"/&gt;

A [[List of interstellar and circumstellar molecules|number of molecules]] exist in interstellar space, as can tiny 0.1&amp;nbsp;[[Micrometre|μm]] dust particles.{{sfn|Rauchfuss|2008|pp=72–81}} The tally of molecules discovered through [[radio astronomy]] is steadily increasing at the rate of about four new species per year. Large regions of higher density matter known as [[molecular cloud]]s allow chemical reactions to occur, including the formation of organic polyatomic species. Much of this chemistry is driven by collisions. Energetic cosmic rays penetrate the cold, dense clouds and ionize hydrogen and helium, resulting, for example, in the [[trihydrogen cation]]. An ionized helium atom can then split relatively abundant [[carbon monoxide]] to produce ionized carbon, which in turn can lead to organic chemical reactions.&lt;ref name="PNAS103_33_12232"/&gt;

The local interstellar medium is a region of space within 100&amp;nbsp;[[parsec]]s (pc) of the Sun, which is of interest both for its proximity and for its interaction with the Solar System. This volume nearly coincides with a region of space known as the [[Local Bubble]], which is characterized by a lack of dense, cold clouds. It forms a cavity in the [[Orion Arm]] of the Milky Way galaxy, with dense molecular clouds lying along the borders, such as those in the [[constellation]]s of [[Ophiuchus]] and [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]]. (The actual distance to the border of this cavity varies from 60 to 250&amp;nbsp;pc or more.) This volume contains about 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;–10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; stars and the local interstellar gas counterbalances the [[Stellar-wind bubble|astrospheres]] that surround these stars, with the volume of each sphere varying depending on the local density of the interstellar medium. The Local Bubble contains dozens of warm interstellar clouds with temperatures of up to 7,000&amp;nbsp;K and radii of 0.5–5&amp;nbsp;pc.&lt;ref name=redfield2006/&gt;

When stars are moving at sufficiently high [[peculiar velocities]], their astrospheres can generate [[bow shock]]s as they collide with the interstellar medium. For decades it was assumed that the Sun had a bow shock. In 2012, data from [[Interstellar Boundary Explorer|Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX)]] and NASA's [[Voyager program|Voyager]] probes showed that the Sun's bow shock does not exist. Instead, these authors argue that a [[Mach number|subsonic]] bow wave defines the transition from the solar wind flow to the interstellar medium.&lt;ref name=bow_science/&gt;&lt;ref name=bow/&gt; A bow shock is the third boundary of an astrosphere after the [[Heliosphere#Termination shock|termination shock]] and the astropause (called the heliopause in the Solar System).&lt;ref name=bow/&gt;

=== Intergalactic space ===
[[File:LH 95.jpg|thumb|right|[[LH 95|A]] [[star]]-forming region in the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]], perhaps the closest Galaxy to Earth's [[Milky Way]]]]
{{See also|Intracluster medium}}
Intergalactic space is the physical space between galaxies. Studies of the large scale distribution of galaxies show that the Universe has a foam-like structure, with [[Galaxy groups and clusters|clusters and groups of galaxies]] lying along filaments that occupy about a tenth of the total space. The remainder forms huge voids that are mostly empty of galaxies. Typically, a [[Void (astronomy)|void]] spans a distance of (10–40) ''h''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; Mpc, where ''h'' is the [[Hubble constant]] in units of {{nowrap|100 km s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; Mpc&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}.{{sfn|Wszolek|2013|p=67}}

Surrounding and stretching between galaxies, there is a [[rarefaction|rarefied]] plasma&lt;ref name=jafelice_opher1992/&gt; that is organized in a [[galaxy filament|galactic filamentary]] structure.&lt;ref name=wadsley2002/&gt; This material is called the intergalactic medium (IGM). The density of the IGM is 5–200 times the average density of the Universe.&lt;ref name="apj_714_1715"/&gt; It consists mostly of ionized hydrogen; i.e. a plasma consisting of equal numbers of electrons and protons. As gas falls into the intergalactic medium from the voids, it heats up to temperatures of 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;K to 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;K,&lt;ref name=baas41_908/&gt; which is high enough so that collisions between atoms have enough energy to cause the bound electrons to escape from the hydrogen nuclei; this is why the IGM is ionized. At these temperatures, it is called the [[warm–hot intergalactic medium]] (WHIM). (Although the plasma is very hot by terrestrial standards, 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; K is often called "warm" in astrophysics.) Computer simulations and observations indicate that up to half of the atomic matter in the Universe might exist in this warm–hot, rarefied state.&lt;ref name="apj_714_1715" /&gt;&lt;ref name=ssr134_1_141/&gt;&lt;ref name="apjs_182_378"/&gt; When gas falls from the filamentary structures of the WHIM into the galaxy clusters at the intersections of the cosmic filaments, it can heat up even more, reaching temperatures of 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;K and above in the so-called intracluster medium.&lt;ref name="apj546_100"/&gt;

For the majority of human history, space was explored by observations made from the Earth's surface—initially with the unaided eye and then with the telescope. Prior to the advent of reliable rocket technology, the closest that humans had come to reaching outer space was through the use of balloon flights. In 1935, the U.S. ''[[Explorer II]]'' manned balloon flight had reached an altitude of {{Convert|22|km|mi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=ssr13_2_199/&gt; This was greatly exceeded in 1942 when the third launch of the German [[V-2 rocket|A-4 rocket]] climbed to an altitude of about {{Convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on}}. In 1957, the unmanned satellite ''[[Sputnik 1]]'' was launched by a Russian [[R-7 Semyorka|R-7 rocket]], achieving Earth orbit at an altitude of {{Convert|215|-|939|km|mi}}.{{sfn|O'Leary|2009|pp=209–224}} This was followed by the first human spaceflight in 1961, when [[Yuri Gagarin]] was sent into orbit on [[Vostok 1]]. The first humans to escape low-Earth orbit were [[Frank Borman]], [[Jim Lovell]] and [[William Anders]] in 1968 on board the U.S. [[Apollo 8]], which achieved lunar orbit{{sfn|Harrison|2002|pp=60–63}} and reached a maximum distance of {{Convert|377349|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the Earth.{{sfn|Orloff|2001}}

The first spacecraft to reach escape velocity was the Soviet [[Luna 1]], which performed a fly-by of the Moon in 1959.{{sfn|Hardesty|Eisman|Krushchev|2008|pp=89–90}} In 1961, [[Venera 1]] became the first planetary probe. It revealed the presence of the solar wind and performed the first fly-by of [[Venus]], although contact was lost before reaching Venus. The first successful planetary mission was the 1962 fly-by of Venus by [[Mariner 2]].{{sfn|Collins|2007|p=86}} The first fly-by of Mars was by [[Mariner 4]] in 1964. Since that time, unmanned spacecraft have successfully examined each of the Solar System's planets, as well their moons and many [[minor planet]]s and comets. They remain a fundamental tool for the exploration of outer space, as well as observation of the Earth.{{sfn|Harris|2008|pp=7, 68–69}} In August 2012, [[Voyager 1]] became the first man-made object to leave the Solar System and enter [[interstellar space]].&lt;ref name="mike_wall"/&gt;

The absence of air makes outer space an ideal location for astronomy at all wavelengths of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. This is evidenced by the spectacular pictures sent back by the [[Hubble Space Telescope]], allowing light from more than 13&amp;nbsp;billion years ago—almost to the time of the Big Bang—to be observed.&lt;ref name=hubblesite_cosmicdawn /&gt; However, not every location in space is ideal for a telescope. The [[Interplanetary dust cloud|interplanetary zodiacal dust]] emits a diffuse near-infrared radiation that can mask the emission of faint sources such as extrasolar planets. Moving an [[infrared telescope]] out past the dust increases its effectiveness.&lt;ref name=esa105/&gt; Likewise, a site like the [[Daedalus (crater)|Daedalus crater]] on the [[far side of the Moon]] could shield a [[radio telescope]] from the [[Electromagnetic interference|radio frequency interference]] that hampers Earth-based observations.&lt;ref name=maccone2001/&gt;

Unmanned spacecraft in Earth orbit are an essential technology of modern civilization. They allow direct monitoring of [[Weather satellite|weather conditions]], relay [[Communications satellite|long-range communications]] like television, provide a means of [[Satellite navigation|precise navigation]], and allow [[remote sensing]] of the Earth. The latter role serves a wide variety of purposes, including tracking soil moisture for agriculture, prediction of water outflow from seasonal snow packs, detection of diseases in plants and trees, and [[Spy satellite|surveillance]] of military activities.{{sfn|Razani|2012|pp=97–99}}

The deep vacuum of space could make it an attractive environment for certain industrial processes, such as those requiring ultraclean surfaces.&lt;ref name=chapman1991/&gt; However, like [[asteroid mining]], [[space manufacturing]] requires significant investment with little prospect of immediate return.&lt;ref name="IJA10_307"/&gt; An important factor in the total expense is the high cost of placing mass into Earth orbit: ${{Inflation|US|6000|2006|r=-3|fmt=c}}–{{Inflation|US|20000|2006|r=-3|fmt=c}} per kg in inflation-adjusted dollars, according to a 2006 estimate.&lt;ref name="jsr43_3_696"/&gt; Proposed concepts for addressing this issue include [[non-rocket spacelaunch]], [[momentum exchange tether]]s, and [[space elevators]].{{sfn|Bolonkin|2010|p=xv}}

[[Interstellar travel]] for a human crew remains at present only a theoretical possibility. The distances to the nearest stars will require new technological developments and the ability to safely sustain crews for journeys lasting several decades. For example, the [[Daedalus Project]] study, which proposed a spacecraft powered by the [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] of [[Deuterium]] and [[Helium-3|He&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;]], would require 36 years to reach the nearby [[Alpha Centauri]] system. Other proposed interstellar propulsion systems include [[light sail]]s, [[Bussard ramjet|ramjets]], and [[beam-powered propulsion]]. More advanced propulsion systems could use [[antimatter]] as a fuel, potentially reaching [[Relativistic speed|relativistic velocities]].&lt;ref name=Crawford1990/&gt;

'''Primary energy''' ('''PE''') is an [[energy]] form found in nature that has not been subjected to any [[energy engineering|human engineered]] conversion process. It is energy contained in raw [[fuel|fuels]], and other forms of energy received as input to a [[system]]. Primary energy can be [[non-renewable resource|non-renewable]] or [[renewable energy|renewable]].

Where primary energy is used to describe fossil fuels, the [[embodied energy]] of the fuel is available as thermal energy and around 70% is typically lost in conversion to electrical or mechanical energy. There is a similar 60-80% conversion loss when solar and wind energy is converted to electricity, but today's UN conventions on energy statistics counts the electricity made from wind and solar as the primary energy itself for these sources. One consequence of this counting method is that the contribution of wind and solar energy is under reported compared to fossil energy sources, and there is hence an international debate on how to count primary energy from wind and solar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sauar|first1=Erik|title=IEA underreports contribution solar and wind by a factor of three compared to fossil fuels|url=http://energypost.eu/iea-underreports-contribution-solar-wind-factor-three-compared-fossil-fuels/|website=energypost.eu|publisher=Energy Post|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''Total primary energy supply''' ('''TPES''') is the sum of production and imports subtracting exports and storage changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/factbook-2013-en/06/01/01/index.html?contentType=&amp;itemId=%2fcontent%2fchapter%2ffactbook-2013-41-en&amp;mimeType=text%2fhtml&amp;containerItemId=%2fcontent%2fserial%2f18147364&amp;accessItemIds=|title=OECD Factbook 2013: Economic, Environmental and Social Statistics|year=2013|accessdate=12 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of primary energy is used in [[energy distance|energy statistics]] in the compilation of [[energy accounting|energy balances]], as well as in the field of [[energetics]]. In energetics, a primary energy source (PES) refers to the energy forms required by the energy sector to generate the supply of [[energy carrier|energy carriers]] used by human society.&lt;ref name="GIAMPIETROMAYUMI2009"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Giampietro |first1=Mario |last2=Mayumi |first2=Kozo |title=The Biofuel Delusion: The Fallacy of Large Scale Agro-Biofuels Production |publisher=Earthscan, Taylor &amp; Francis group |year=2009 |pages=336 |isbn=978-1-84407-681-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Secondary energy''' is a carrier of energy, such as electricity. These are produced by conversion from a primary energy source.

The use of primary energy as a measure ignores conversion efficiency. Thus forms of energy with poor conversion efficiency, particularly the thermal sources, coal, gas and nuclear are overstated, whereas energy sources such as hydroelectricity which are converted efficiently, while a small fraction of primary energy are significantly more important than their total raw energy supply may seem to imply.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

PE and TPES are better defined in the context of [[worldwide energy supply]].

==Examples of sources==
Primary energy sources should not be confused with the [[energy system]] components (or conversion processes) through which they are converted into energy carriers.

==Usable energy==
{{main|exergy}}
[[File:Different energy forms (PES).png|thumb|Primary energy sources are transformed by the energy sector to generate energy carriers.]]
Primary energy sources are transformed in [[energy conversion]] processes to more convenient forms of energy that can directly be used by society, such as [[electrical energy]], refined [[fuels]], or synthetic fuels such as [[hydrogen fuel]]. In the field of [[energetics]], these forms are called [[energy carrier]]s and correspond to the concept of "secondary energy" in energy statistics.

===Conversion to energy carriers (or secondary energy)===
Energy carriers are energy forms which have been transformed from primary energy sources. Electricity is one of the most common energy carriers, being transformed from various primary energy sources such as coal, oil, natural gas, and wind. Electricity is particularly useful since it has low entropy (is highly ordered) and so can be converted into other forms of energy very efficiently. [[District heating]] is another example of secondary energy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.energystar.gov/buildings/facility-owners-and-managers/existing-buildings/use-portfolio-manager/understand-metrics/difference   U.S. EPA Energy STAR] Retrieved 2017-11-03&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[laws of thermodynamics]], primary energy sources cannot be produced. They must be available to society to enable the production of energy carriers.&lt;ref name="GIAMPIETROMAYUMI2009" /&gt;

[[Thermal efficiency|Conversion efficiency]] varies. For thermal energy, electricity and mechanical energy production is limited by [[Carnot's theorem]], and generates a lot of [[waste heat]]. Other non-thermal conversions can be more efficient. For example, while wind turbines do not capture all of the wind's energy, they have a high conversion efficiency and generate very little waste heat since wind energy is low entropy. In principle solar photovoltaic conversions could be very efficient, but current conversion can only be done well for narrow ranges of wavelength, whereas solar thermal is also subject to Carnot efficiency limits. Hydroelectric power is also very ordered, and converted very efficiently. The amount of usable energy is the [[exergy]] of a system.

===Site and source energy===
Site energy is the term used in North America for the amount of end-use energy of all forms consumed at a specified location. This can be a mix of primary energy (such as natural gas burned at the site) and secondary energy (such as electricity). Site energy is measured at the campus, building, or sub-building level and is the basis for energy charges on utility bills.&lt;ref name="NRCan"&gt;{{cite web|title=Measuring energy: site energy vs. source energy in ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager|url=http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/energy/efficiency/buildings/energy-benchmarking/update/getready/19453|publisher=[[Natural Resources Canada]]|accessdate=November 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Source energy, in contrast, is the term used in North America for the amount of primary energy consumed in order to provide a facility’s site energy. It is always greater than the site energy, as it includes all site energy and adds to it the energy lost during transmission, delivery, and conversion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Torcellini|first=Paul|last2=Pless|first2=Shanti|last3=Deru|first3=Michael|last4=Crawley|first4=Drury|date=June 2006|title=Zero energy buildings: a critical look at the definition|url=https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy06osti/39833.pdf|journal=ACEEE Summer Study|publisher=National Renewable Energy Laboratory/U.S. Department of Energy|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While source or primary energy provides a more complete picture of energy consumption, it cannot be measured directly and must be calculated using conversion factors from site energy measurements.&lt;ref name="NRCan" /&gt; For electricity, a typical value is three units of source energy for one unit of site energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Site Energy vs Source Energy|url=http://wbi.worldbank.org/energy/content/site-energy-vs-source-energy|publisher=The World Bank|accessdate=November 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this can vary considerably depending on factors such as the primary energy source or fuel type, the type of power plant, and the transmission infrastructure. One full set of conversion factors is available as technical reference from [[Energy Star|Energy STAR]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://portfoliomanager.energystar.gov/pdf/reference/Source%20Energy.pdf|title=Technical Reference: Source Energy|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Either site or source energy can be an appropriate metric when comparing or analyzing energy use of different facilities. The U.S [[Energy Information Administration]], for example, uses primary (source) energy for its energy overviews&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/|title=Total Energy - U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)|website=www.eia.gov|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; but site energy for its Commercial Building Energy Consumption Survey&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eia.gov/consumption/commercial/terminology.php|title=Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) - U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)|website=www.eia.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Residential Building Energy Consumption Survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/terminology.php|title=Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS) - U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)|website=www.eia.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]]'s [[Energy Star|Energy STAR]] program recommends using source energy,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.energystar.gov/buildings/facility-owners-and-managers/existing-buildings/use-portfolio-manager/understand-metrics/difference|title=The difference between source and site energy|website=www.energystar.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[United States Department of Energy|US Department of Energy]] uses site energy in its definition of a [[Zero-energy building|zero net energy building]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://energy.gov/eere/buildings/articles/doe-releases-common-definition-zero-energy-buildings-campuses-and|title=DOE Releases Common Definition for Zero Energy Buildings, Campuses, and Communities|website=Energy.gov|access-date=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Energy accidents}}

Energy accidents are accidents that occur in systems that provide energy or power. These can result in fatalities, as can the normal running of many systems, for example those deaths due to pollution.

Globally, coal is responsible for 100,000 deaths per trillion kWh.&lt;ref name=deadly&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2012/06/10/energys-deathprint-a-price-always-paid/#2f9f079649d2 How Deadly Is Your Kilowatt? We Rank The Killer Energy Sources James Conca, June 10, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''sociology of space''' is a sub-discipline of [[sociology]] that mostly borrows from theories developed within the discipline of [[geography]], including the sub fields of [[human geography]], [[economic geography]], and [[feminist geography]]. The "sociology" of space examines the social and material constitution of spaces. It is concerned with understanding the social practices, institutional forces, and material complexity of how humans and spaces interact. The sociology of space is an inter-disciplinary area of study, drawing on various theoretical traditions including [[Marxism]], [[postcolonialism]], and [[Science and Technology Studies]], and overlaps and encompasses theorists with various academic disciplines such as [[geography]] and [[architecture]].  Edward T. Hall developed the study of [[Proxemics]] which concentrates on the empirical analysis of space in psychology.  

== Definition of space ==
Space is one of the most important concepts within the disciplines of social science as it is fundamental to our understanding of geography. The term "space" has been defined variously by scholars:

In general terms, the Oxford English Dictionary defines space in two ways;

1. A continuous extension viewed with or without reference to the existence of objects within it.  
2. The interval between points or objects viewed as having one, two or three dimensions.

However, the human geographers’ interest is in the objects within the space and their relative position, which involves the description, explanation and prediction of the distribution of phenomena. Thus, the relationships between objects in space is the central of the study.

[[Michel Foucault]] defines space as;
“The space in which we live, which draws us out of ourselves, in which the erosion of our lives, our time and our history occurs, the space that claws and gnaws at us, is also, in itself, a heterogeneous space…..we live inside a set of relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kham|first=Miriam|title=Tahiti Intertwined: Ancestral Land, Tourist Postcard, and Nuclear Test Site|journal=American Anthropologist|date=March 2000|volume= 102| issue = 1|series=New Series|pages=7–26|jstor=683535|doi=10.1525/aa.2000.102.1.7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nigel Thrift]] also defines space as;
"The outcome of a series of highly problematic temporary settlements that divide and connect things up into different kinds of collectives which are slowly provided with the meaning which render them durable and sustainable." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thrift|first=Nigel|title=Key Concept in Geography|year=2003|location=London; SAGE|pages=95–107|editor=Sarah L. Hollaway |editor2=Stephen P. Rice |editor3=Gill Valentine|chapter=Space: The Fundamental Stuff of Human Geography}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In short, "space" is the social space in which we live and create relationships with other people, societies and surroundings. Space is an outcome of the hard and continuous work of building up and maintaining collectives by bringing different things into alignments. All kinds of different spaces can and therefore do exist which may or may not relate to each other. Thus, through space, we can understand more about social action.

== History of the sociology of space ==

[[Georg Simmel]] has been seen as the classical sociologist who was most important to this field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation   | last1 = Urry | first1 = John | contribution = The Sociology of Space and Place  | series = Blackwell companion to sociology | pages = 5 | year = 2004|isbn=1-4051-2267-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Simmel wrote on "the sociology of space" in his 1908 book "Sociology: Investigations on the Forms of Sociation". His concerns included the process of metropolitanisation and the separation of leisure spaces in modern economic societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title =Theory and Method |last=Jary| first=David |url =http://www.reading.ac.uk/RevSoc/archive/volume10/number1/10-1b.htm | year=1997 |accessdate =2010-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The category of [[space]] long played a subordinate role in sociological theory formation. Only in the late 1980s did it come to be realised that certain changes in society cannot be adequately explained without taking greater account of the spatial components of life. This shift in perspective is referred to as the [[topological turn]]. The space concept directs attention to organisational forms of juxtaposition. The focus is on differences between places and their mutual influence. This applies equally for the micro-spaces of everyday life and the macro-spaces at the nation-state or global levels.

The theoretical basis for the growing interest of the social sciences in space was set primarily by English and French-speaking sociologists, philosophers, and human geographers. Of particular importance is [[Michel Foucault| Michel Foucault’s]] essay on “Of Other Spaces”,&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, Michel (1991, orig. 1967), »Andere Räume«, in: Wentz, Martin (Hg.), Stadt-Räume, Frankfurt a. M./New York, S. 65–72&lt;/ref&gt; in which the author proclaims the “age of space”, and [[Henri Lefebvre| Henri Lefebvre’s]] seminal work “La production de l’espace”.&lt;ref&gt;Lefebvre, Henri (1991, orig. 1974), The Production of Space, D. Nicholson-Smith trans., Oxford: Basil Blackwell, {{ISBN|0-631-14048-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter provided the grounding for Marxist spatial theory on which [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]], [[Manuel Castells]], [[Edward Soja]], and others have built. Marxist theories of space, which are predicated on a structural, i.e., capitalist or global determinants of spaces and the growing homogenization of space, are confronted by action theoretical conceptions, which stress the importance of the corporeal placing and the perception of spaces as albeit habitually predetermined but subjective constructions. One example is the theory of space of the German sociologist [[Martina Löw]].&lt;ref&gt;Löw, Martina (2001), Raumsoziologie, Frankfurt a. M.&lt;/ref&gt; Approaches deriving from the [[Postcolonialism|post-colonialism]] discourse have attracted greater attention in recent years. Also in contrast to (neo)Marxist concepts of space, British geographer [[Doreen Massey (geographer)|Doreen Massey]]&lt;ref&gt;Massey, Doreen (1999a), Power-Geometries and the Politics of Space-Time, Heidelberg&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Massey, Doreen (1999b), »Spaces of Politics«, in: Massey, Doreen/Allen, John/Sarre, Philip (Hg.), Human Geography Today, Cambridge/Oxford/Malden, S. 279–294&lt;/ref&gt; and German sociologist [[Helmuth Berking]],&lt;ref&gt;Berking, Helmuth (1998), »›Global Flows and Local Cultures‹. Über die Rekonfiguration sozialer Räume im Globalisierungsprozeß«, in: Berliner Journal für Soziologie, 8, 3, S. 381–392&lt;/ref&gt; for instance, emphasise the heterogeneity of local contexts and the place-relatedness of our knowledge about the world.

== Duality of space ==

[[Martina Löw]] developed the idea of a "relational" model of space, which focuses on the “orderings”&lt;ref&gt;Löw, Martina (2008), »The Constitution of Space: The Structuration of Spaces Through the Simultaneity of Effects and Perception«, in: European Journal of Social Theory, 1, 11&lt;/ref&gt; of living entities and social goods, and examines how space is constituted in processes of perception, recall, or ideation to manifest itself as societal structure. From a social theory point of view, it follows on from the theory of structuration proposed by [[Anthony Giddens]],&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, Anthony (1984), The Constitution of Society. Outline of the Theory of Structuration. Cambridge: Polity&lt;/ref&gt; whose concept of the “duality of structure” Löw extends sociological terms into a “duality of space.” The basic idea is that individuals act as social agents (and constitute spaces in the process), but that their action depends on economic, legal, social, cultural, and, finally, spatial structures. Spaces are hence the outcome of action. At the same time, spaces structure action, that is to say spaces can both constrain and enable action.

With respect to the constitution of space, Löw distinguishes analytically between two, generally mutually determining factors: “spacing” and “synthesis.” Spacing refers to the act of placing or the state of being placed of social goods and people in places. According to Löw, however, an ordering created through placings is only effectively constituted as space where the elements that compose it are actively interlinked by people – in processes of perception, ideation, or recall. Löw calls this synthesis. This concept has been empirically tested in studies such as those by [[Lars Meier]] (who examined the constitution of space in the everyday life of financial managers in London and Singapore), [[Cedric Janowicz]] (who carried out an ethnographical-space sociological study of food supply in the Ghanaian city of [[Accra]]), and [[Silke Streets]] (who looked at processes of space constitution in the creative industries in Leipzig).

== Marxist approaches ==

The most important proponent of Marxist spatial theory was [[Henri Lefebvre]]. He proposed "social space" to be where the [[relations of production]] are reproduced and that dialectical contradictions were spatial rather than temporal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Lefebvre, Henri | title=The Survival of Capitalism: Reproduction of the Relations of Production | publisher=Allison &amp; Busby | year=1973 | isbn=0-85031-173-X}}, p17-19&lt;/ref&gt; Lefèbvre sees the societal production of space as a dialectical interaction between three factors. Space is constituted:

* by “spatial practice,” meaning space as reproduced in everyday life
* by the “representation of space”, meaning space as developed cognitively
* and by “spaces of representation,” by which Lefebvre means complex symbolisations and ideational spaces.

In Lefebvre’s view of the 1970s, this spatial production resulted in a space of non-reflexive everydayness marked by alienation, dominating through mathematical-abstract concepts of space, and reproduced in spatial practice. Lefebvre sees a line of flight from alienated spatiality in the spaces of representation – in notions of non-alienated, mythical, pre-modern, or artistic visions of space.

Marxist spatial theory was given decisive new impetus by [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]], in particular, who was interested in the effects of the transition from [[Fordism]] to “flexible accumulation” on the experience of space and time.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, David (1989), The Condition of Postmodernity, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; He shows how various innovations at the economic and technological levels have breached the crisis-prone inflexibility of the Fordist system, thus increasing the turnover rate of capital. This causes a general acceleration of economic cycles. According to Harvey, the result is “time-space compression.” While the feeling for the long term, for the future, for continuity is lost, the relationship between proximity and distance becomes more and more difficult to determine.

== Postcolonial theories of space ==

Theories of space that are inspired by the [[Postcolonialism|post-colonialism]] discourse focus on the heterogeneity of spaces. According to [[Doreen Massey (geographer)|Doreen Massey]], calling a country in Africa a “developing country” is not appropriate, since this expression implies that spatial difference is temporal difference (Massey 1999b). This logic treats such a country not as different but merely as an early version of countries in the “developed” world, a view she condemns as "Eurocentrism." In this vein, [[Helmuth Berking]] criticises theories that postulate the increasing homogenisation of the world through globalisation as “globocentrism.” He confronts this with the distinctiveness and importance of local knowledge resources for the production of (different and specific) places. He claims that local contexts form a sort of framework or filter through which global processes and globally circulating images and symbols are appropriated, thus attaining meaning. For instance, the film character [[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]] is a different figure in radical rightwing circles in Germany than in the black ghettoes of the Chicago Southside, just as [[McDonald’s]] means something different in Moscow than in Paris.

== Third Space ==
[[Henri Lefebvre]] (see also [[Edward Soja]]) says that (social) space is a (social) product, or a complex social construction (based on values, and the social production of meanings) which affects spatial practices and perceptions. He explains space embraces a multitude of intersection in his great book, “Production of Space”. That means that we need to consider how the various modes of spatial production relate to each other.

He argues that there are three aspects to our spatial existence, which exist in a kind of triad:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lefebvre|first=Henri|title=Marxist &amp; Social Constructivist Approaches to Place|url=http://pegasus.cc.ucf.edu/~janzb/courses/hum3930b/lefebvre1.htm|publisher=Pegasus|accessdate=2013-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1. First Space
(Physical space/perceived space)
"The spatial practice of a society secretes that society's space; it propounds and presupposes it, in a dialectical interaction; it produces it slowly and surely as it masters and appropriates it."

2. Second Space
(Mental space/conceived space)
"Conceptualized space, the space of scientists, planners, urbanists, technocratic subdividers and social engineers, as of a certain type of artist with a scientific bent -- all of whom identify what is lived and what is perceived with what is conceived."

3. Third Space
(Social space/lived space)
"Space as directly lived through its associated images and symbols."

Even though there are many disciplines in the study of Human Geography, the most well-known approach is “The third space” formulated by [[Edward Soja]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=J. Smith|first=Susan|title=Introducing Human Geographies|year=1999|publisher=Arnold|location=London|pages=12–22|chapter=Society-Space|editor=Paul Cloke |editor2=Philip Crang |editor3=Mark Goodwin}}&lt;/ref&gt; In unitary theory, there are three approaches; first space, second space and third space. First space is physical space, and spaces are measurable and mappable. The second space is a mental or conceived space which comes from our thinking and ideas. However, the third space is a social space/lived space which is a social product that is a space created by society under oppression or marginalization that want to reclaim the space of inequality and make it into something else. Soja argues that our old ways to thinking about space (first and second space theories) can no longer accommodate the way the world works because he believed that spaces may not be contained within one social category, they may include different aspects of many categories or developed within the boundaries of a number of category. For instance, two different cultures combine together and emerge as a third culture. This third hybrid space displaces the original values that constitute it and set up new values and perspectives that is different from the first two spaces. Thus, the third space theory can explain some of the complexity of poverty, social exclusion and social inclusion, gender and race issues.

== Rational view of space ==
In the work of geographer and critical theorist [[Nigel Thrift]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thrift|first=Nigel|title=Key Concept in Geography|year=2003|location=London; SAGE|pages=95–107|editor=Sarah L. Hollaway |editor2=Stephen P. Rice |editor3=Gill Valentine|chapter=Space: The Fundamental Stuff of Human Geography}}&lt;/ref&gt; he wrote a rational view of space in which, rather than seeing space being viewed as a container within which the world proceeds, space should be seen as a co-product of these proceedings. He explained about four constructed space in modern human geography. 
There are four different kinds of space according to how modern geography thinks about space. They are 1. Empirical Construction of Space, 2. Unblocking space, 3. Image space and 4. Place Space.

'''First Space''' is the empirical construction of space. Empirical space refers to the process whereby the mundane fabric of daily life is constructed. These simple things like, cars, houses, mobiles, computers and roads are very simple but they are great achievements of our daily life and they play very important role in making up who we are today. For example, today’s technology such as GPS did not suddenly come into existence; in fact, it is laid down in the 18th century and developed throughout time. The first space is real and tangible, and it is also known as physical space.
'''Second space''' is the unblocking space. This type of space refers to the process whereby routine pathways of interaction as set up around which boundaries are often drawn. The routine may include the movement of office workers, the interaction of drunk teenagers, and the flow of goods, money, people, and information. Unlike the old time in geography when people accepted a space as blocked boundary (Example: A capitalist space, neoliberal space or city space), we began to realize that there is no such thing like boundaries in space. The space of the world is flowing and transforming continuously that it is very difficult to describe in a fixed way. The second space is ideology/conceptual and it is also known as mental space. For example, the second space will explain the behaviors of people from different social class and the social segregation among rich and poor people. 
'''Third space''' is the image space that refers to the process whereby the images has produced new kind of space. The images may be in different form and shape; ranging from painting to photograph, from portrait to post card, and from religious theme to entertainment. Nowadays, we are highly influenced by images in many ways and these certain images can tell us new social and cultures values, or something new about how we see the world. Images, symbols and sign do have some kind of spatial expression. 
'''Fourth space''' is the place that refers to the process whereby spaces are ordered in ways that open up affective and other embodied potentials. Place space has more meaning than a place, and it can represent as different type of space. This fourth type of space tries to understand that place is a vital actor in bringing up people's lives in certain ways and place will let us to understand all kind of things which are hidden form us..

==Scale: the local and the global==
Andrew Herod &lt;ref&gt;Harod, A. 2003. "Scale: the local and the global".  Key Concepts in Geography. London: SAGE.&lt;/ref&gt; mentioned that scale, within human geography, is typically seen in one of the two ways: either as a real material thing which actually exists and is the result of political struggle and/or social process, or as a way of framing our understanding of the world. People’s lives across the globe have been re-scaling by contemporary economic, political, cultural and social processes, such as [[globalization]], in complex ways. As a result, we have seen the creation of [[supra-national]] political bodies such as the [[European Union]], the devolution of political power from the nation-state to regional political bodies.&lt;ref&gt;PoliticalGeography. 1997. Special Issue on " The political geography of scale".Political Geography.&lt;/ref&gt; We have also experienced the increasing homogenization and ‘[[Americanization]]’ through the process of globalization while the locals’ tendencies (or counter force)among people who defend traditional ways of life increase around the world .The process of re-scaling people‘s lives and the relationship between the two extremes of our scaled lives- the ‘global’ and the ‘local’ were brought into question.

===Ontological status of the global and the local===
Until the 1980s, theorizing the concept of ‘scale’ itself was taken for granted although physical and human geographers looked at issues from ‘regional scale’ or‘national scale’. The questions such as whether scale is simply a mental device categorizing and ordering the world or whether scales really exists as material social products, particularly, were debated among [[materialists]] and [[idealists]]. Some geographers draw upon Immanuel Kant’s idealist philosophy that scales were handy conceptual mechanism for ordering the world while others, by drawing upon Marxist ideas of materialism, argue that scales really exist in the world and they were the real social products. For those idealists based on Kantian‘s inspiration, the ‘global’ is defined by the geologically given limits of the earth and the ‘local’ is defined as a spatial resolution useful for comprehending the process and practices. For materialists, the ‘national’ scale is a scale that had to be actively created through economic and political processes but not a scale existed in a logical hierarchy between global and the regional.

The notion of ‘becoming’ and the focus on the politics of producing scales have been central to materialist&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, P.J. 1982. "A materialist framework for political geography", Transactions, Institute of British Geographers.&lt;/ref&gt; arguments concerning the global scale. It is important to recognize that social actors may have to work just as hard to become ‘local’as they have to work to become ‘global’. People paid attention to how transnational corporations have ‘gone global’, how institutions of governance have‘become’ supra-national and how labour unions have sought to ‘globalize’ their operations to match those of an increasingly ‘globalized’ city.

For the scale ‘global’ and ‘local’, Kevin Cox mentioned that moving from the local to the global scale ‘is not a movement from one discrete arena to another’ but a process of developing networks of associations that allow actors to shift between various spaces of engagement. According to his view, ‘scale’ is seen as a process rather than as a fixed entity and, in other words, the global and the local are not static ’arenas’within which social life plays out but are constantly made by social actions.For example, a political organization might attempt to go ‘global’ to engage with actors or opportunities outside of its own space; likewise, a transnational corporation may attempt to ‘go local’ through tailoring its products and operations in different places.

===Discourses of the global and the local===
[[J. K. Gibson-Graham|Gibson-Graham]]&lt;ref&gt;Gibson-Graham, J.K. 2002. "Beyond global vs. local: economic politics outside the binary frame" in: A. Herold and M.W. Wright(eds) . Geographies of Power: Placing Scale. Oxford: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; (2002) has identified at least six ways in which the relationship between the local and the global is often viewed.

1. The global and the local are seen as interpretive frames for analyzing situations

2. Drawing on Dirlik, Gibson-Graham suggests that in such a representation, the global is ‘something more than the national or regional ..anything other than the local’. Meaning that, the global and the local each derive meaning from what they are not.

3. According to French social theorist [[Bruno Latour]], the local and the global ‘offer different points of view on networks that are by nature neither local nor global, but are more or less long and more or less connected. Also, in Latour’s view, it is impossible to distinguish where the local ends and the global begins.

4. The concept ‘The global is local’ was proposed by Gibson-Graham. For instance, multinational firms are actually ‘multi local‘ rather than ‘global’.

5. The local is global. In this view, the local is an entry point to the world of global flows which encircle the planet.

6. The global and the local are actually the processes rather than the locations. All spaces are the hybrids of global and local; so they are ‘glocal.’

There are some western thoughts that greater size and extensiveness imply domination and superior power, such that the local is often represented as ‘small and relatively powerless, defined and confined by the global’. So, the global is a force and the local is its field of play. However, the local can serve as a powerful scale of political organization; the global is not a scale just controlled by capital – those who challenge capital can also organize globally( Herod, A). There has been the concept ‘Think globally and act locally’ viewed by [[neoliberals]].

===Metaphors of scale===
For representing how the world is scaled, there are five different and popular metaphors: they are the ladder, concentric circles, Matryoshka nesting dolls, earthworm burrows and tree roots. First, in using such a metaphor of hierarchical ladder, the global as the highest rung on the ladder is seen to be above the local and all other scales. Second, the use of concentric metaphor leaves us with a particular way of conceptualizing the scalar relationship between places. In this second metaphor, the local is seen as a relatively small circle, with the regional as a larger circle encompassing it, while the national and the global scales are still larger circles encompassing the local and the regional. For the hierarchy of Russian Matryoshka nesting dolls, the global can contain other scales but this does not work the other way round; for instance, the local cannot contain the global. For the fourth metaphor concerning with thinking on scale, what French social theorist [[Bruno Latour]] argued is that a world of places is ‘networked’ together. Such the metaphor leaves us with an image of scale in which the global and the local are connected together and not totally separated from each other.  For the tree roots metaphor similar with the earthworm burrow metaphor, as the earthworm burrows or tree roots penetrating different strata of the soil, it is difficult to determine exactly where one scale ends and another begins. When thinking about the use of metaphor, it should be aware that the choice of metaphor over another is not made on the basis of which is empirically a ‘more accurate’representation of something but, on the basis of how someone is attempting to understand a particular phenomenon.

Such an appreciation of metaphors is important because it suggests that how we talk about scale impacts upon the ways in which we engage socially and politically with our scaled world and that may impact on how we conduct our social, economic and political praxis and so make landscapes ( Herod,A&lt;ref&gt;Herod, A., Wright, M.W (eds). 2002. Geographies of Power: Placing Scale. Oxford: Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt; )

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3245">'''Energy statistics''' refers to collecting, compiling, analyzing and disseminating data on commodities such as [[coal]], [[crude oil]], [[natural gas]], [[electricity]], or renewable energy sources ([[biomass]], [[geothermal power|geothermal]], [[wind power|wind]] or [[solar power|solar energy]]), when they are used for the energy they contain. [[Energy]] is the capability of some substances, resulting from their physico-chemical properties, to do [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]] or produce [[heat]]. Some energy commodities, called [[fuels]], release their [[energy content]] as heat when they [[combustion|burn]]. This heat could be used to run an [[Internal combustion engine|internal]] or [[external combustion engine]].

The need to have [[statistics]] on energy commodities became obvious during the [[1973 oil crisis]] that brought tenfold increase in [[petroleum prices]]. Before the crisis, to have accurate data on global energy supply and demand was not deemed critical. Another concern of energy statistics today is a huge gap in energy use between [[developed country|developed]] and [[developing country|developing]] countries. As the gap narrows (''see picture''), the pressure on energy supply increases tremendously.[[Image:Global energy consumption.jpg|thumb|right|525px|Global energy consumption per capita, 1950-2004]] 

The data on energy and electricity come from three principal sources:
* [[Energy industry]]
* Other industries ("self-producers")
* Consumers
The flows of and trade in energy commodities are measured both in physical units (e.g., [[metric ton]]s), and, when [[Energy accounting|energy balances]] are calculated, in energy units (e.g., [[terajoule]]s or [[Ton of oil equivalent|tons of oil equivalent]]). What makes energy statistics specific and different from other fields of [[economic statistics]] is the fact that energy commodities undergo greater number of transformations (flows) than other commodities. In these transformations energy is conserved, as defined by and within the limitations of the [[First law of thermodynamics|first]] and [[second law of thermodynamics|second]] laws of thermodynamics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1050">The '''streaming vibration current''' ('''SVI''') and the associated '''streaming vibration potential''' is an [[electric]] signal that arises when an [[acoustic wave]] propagates through a porous body in which the pores are filled with fluid.

Streaming vibration current was experimentally observed in 1948 by M. Williams.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, M. "An Electrokinetic Transducer" The review of scientific instruments, 19, 10, 640–646, 1948&lt;/ref&gt; A theoretical model was developed some 30 years later by Dukhin and coworkers.&lt;ref&gt;Dukhin, S.S., Mischuk, N.A., Kuz’menko, B.B and Il’in, B.I.

'''Surface conductivity''' is an additional [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|conductivity]] of an [[electrolyte]] in the vicinity of charged surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;Surface and [[Conductivity (electrolytic)|volume conductivity]] correspond to the electrically driven motion of [[ions]] in an [[electric field]].&lt;/ref&gt; Close to charged surfaces a layer of [[counter ion]]s of opposite polarity exists which is attracted by the [[surface charge]]s. This layer of higher ionic concentration is a part of the interfacial [[Double layer (interfacial)|double layer]]. The concentration of the ions in this layer is higher as compared to the [[Conductivity (electrolytic)|volume conductivity]] far from the charged surface and leads to a higher conductivity of this layer.

[[Marian Smoluchowski|Smoluchowski]] was the first to recognize the importance of surface conductivity at the beginning of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;M. von Smoluchowski, Physik, Z., 6, 529 (1905)&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a detailed description of surface conductivity by Lyklema in "Fundamentals of Interface and Colloid Science" &lt;ref&gt;Lyklema, J. "Fundamentals of Interface and Colloid Science", vol. 2, Academic Press, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

The Double Layer (DL) has two regions, according to the well established Gouy-Chapman-Stern model, Ref.2. The upper level, which is in contact with the bulk fluid is the [[diffuse layer]]. The inner layer that is in contact with interface is the [[Stern layer]].

It is possible that the lateral motion of ions in both parts of the DL contributes to the surface conductivity.

The contribution of the Stern layer is less well described. It is often called "additional surface conductivity".&lt;ref&gt;Dukhin, S.S. and Derjaguin, B.V. "Electrokinetic Phenomena", John Wiley and Sons, New York (1974)&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory of the surface conductivity of the diffuse part of the DL was developed by Bikerman.&lt;ref&gt;Bikerman, J.J. Z.Physik.Chem. A163, 378, 1933&lt;/ref&gt; He derived a simple equation that links surface conductivity κ&lt;sup&gt;σ&lt;/sup&gt; with the behaviour of ions at the interface. For symmetrical electrolyte and assuming identical ions diffusion coefficients D&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;=D&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;=D it is given in Ref.2:

:&lt;math&gt; {\kappa}^{\sigma} = \frac{4F^2Cz^2D(1+3m/z^2)}{RT\kappa}\left(\cosh\frac{zF\zeta}{2RT}-1\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where
:F is the [[Faraday constant]]
:T is the [[absolute temperature]]
:R is the [[gas constant]]
:C is the ionic concentration in the bulk fluid
:z is the [[ion]] [[valence (chemistry)|valency]]
:ζ is the [[electrokinetic potential]]

The parameter ''m'' characterizes the contribution of [[electro-osmosis]] to the motion of ions within the DL:
:&lt;math&gt; m = \frac{2\varepsilon_0\varepsilon_m R^2T^2}{3\eta F^2 D}&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Dukhin number]] is a dimensionless parameter that characterizes the contribution of the surface conductivity to a variety of [[electrokinetic phenomena]], such as, [[electrophoresis]] and [[electroacoustic phenomena]].

==Surface Science==
'''Surface conductivity''' may refer to the electrical conduction across a solid surface measured by surface probes. Experiments may be done to test this material property as in the [[Extrinsic semiconductor|n-type]] surface conductivity of [[Extrinsic semiconductor|p-type]] &lt;ref&gt; W.L. Brown. "n-Type Surface Conductivity on p-Type Germanium". Phys. Rev. 91, 518 (1953). &lt;/ref&gt;. Additionally, surface conductivity is measured in coupled phenomena such as [[Photoconductivity|photoconductivity]], for example, for the metal oxide semiconductor [[Zinc oxide|ZnO]]&lt;ref&gt;Y. Shapira, S.M. Cox and David Lichtman. "CHEMISORPTION, PHOTODESORPTION AND CONDUCTIVITY
MEASUREMENTS ON ZnO SURFACES". Surface Science 54, 43 (1976). &lt;/ref&gt;. Surface conductivity differs from bulk conductivity for analogous reasons to the electrolyte solution case, where the [[Charge carrier|charge carriers]] of holes (+1) and electrons (-1) play the role of ions in solution.

[https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/11/science/universe-as-doughnut-new-data-new-debate.html “Universe as Doughnut: New Data, New Debate”]&lt;/ref&gt; The theory describes the [[shape of the universe]] (topology) as a [[Three-torus#Three-dimensional torus|three-dimensional torus]].

The [[cosmic microwave background]] (CMB) was discovered by [[Bell Labs]] in 1964. Greater understanding of the universe's CMB provided greater understanding of the universe's topology{{elucidate|date=May 2017}}.  In order to understand these CMB results, [[NASA]] supported development of two exploratory satellites, the [[Cosmic Background Explorer]] (COBE) in 1989{{clarify|did they just support development in this year?|date=May 2017}} and the [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe]] (WMAP) in 2001{{clarify|did they just support development in this year?|date=May 2017}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13373">'''Visual space''' is the [[perception|perceptual]] space housing the [[visual perception|visual]] world being experienced by an aware [[observation|observer]]; it is the subjective counterpart of the space of physical objects before an observer's eyes.

==Spaces of objects and of visual percepts==

===Space of physical objects===

In ''' object space''' the location and shape of physical targets can be accurately described with the tools of geometry. For practical purposes it is [[Euclidean space|Euclidean]]. It is three-dimensional and various co-ordinate systems like the [[Cartesian coordinates|Cartesian]] x,y,z (with a defined origin in relation to an observer's head or eyes), or [[Bipolar coordinates|bipolar]] with angles of elevation, azimuth and binocular parallax (based on the separation of the two eyes) are interchangeable. No elaborate mathematics are needed.

===Space of visual percepts===

'''Percepts''', the counterparts in the aware observer's conscious experience of objects in physical space, constitute an ordered ensemble or, as [[Ernst Cassirer]] explained,&lt;ref&gt;Cassirer, E. (1944). The concept of group and the theory of perception. ''Philosophy and Phenomenological Research'', 5 (1), 1-35.&lt;/ref&gt; the perceptual world has a structure and is not an aggregate of scattered sensations. This visual space can be accessed by introspection, by interrogation, or by suitable experimental procedures which allow relative location as well as some structural properties to be assessed, even quantitatively.

An example illustrates the relationship between the concepts of object and visual space:
Two straight lines are presented to an observer who is asked to set them so that they appear parallel. When this has been done, the lines ''are'' parallel in visual space and now a comparison is feasible with the physical lines' setting in object space. Good precision can be achieved using psychophysical procedures in human observers or behavioral ones in trained animals. The reciprocal experiment is easier to perform but does not yield a numerical read-out as readily: show objectively parallel lines and make a determination of their inclination in the observer's perception.

Considering how it arises (see below), visual space seems, as an immediate, unmediated experience, to provide a remarkably true and unproblematic representation of a real world of objects.

===Visual space and visual field===

The distinction is mandatory between what the eye professions call ''visual field'', the area or extent of physical space that is available to the eye or that is being imaged on the retina, and the virtual, perceptual ''visual space'' in which visual percepts are located, the subject of this entry.
Confusion is caused by the use of ''[[:de:Geschichte der Theorie des Sehens|Sehraum]]'' in the German literature for both. There is no doubt that [[Ewald Hering]] and his followers &lt;ref&gt;Tschermak, A. (1947). ''Einführung in die Physiologische Optik''. Wien: Springer-Verlag&lt;/ref&gt; meant visual space in their disquisitions.

===Spaces: formal, physical, perceptual&lt;!--Linked from 'Rudolf Carnap'--&gt;===
{{See also|Conceptual space}}
The fundamental distinction was made by [[Rudolf Carnap]] between three kinds of space which he called ''formal'', ''physical'' and ''perceptual.''&lt;ref&gt;Carnap, R. (1922). Der Raum. In: ''Kantstudien Ergänzungsheft'', 56&lt;/ref&gt; Mathematicians, for example, deal with ordered structures, ensembles of elements for which rules of logico-deductive relationships hold, limited solely by being not self-contradictory. These are the ''formal'' spaces. According to Carnap, studying ''physical'' space means examining the relationship between empirically determined objects. Finally, there is the realm of what students of Kant know as ''[[:de:Anschauung|Anschauungen]],'' immediate sensory experiences, often awkwardly translated as "[[apperception]]s," which belong to ''perceptual spaces.''

==Visual space and geometry==
Geometry is the discipline devoted to the study of space and the rules relating the elements to each other. For example, in Euclidean space there is the [[Pythagorean theorem]] for distances. In a two-dimensional space of constant curvature, like the surface of a sphere, the rule is somewhat more complex but applies everywhere. On the two-dimensional surface of a football, the rule is more complex still and has different values depending on location. In well-behaved spaces such rules used for measurement and called ''[[Metric (mathematics)|Metrics]],'' are classically handled by the mathematics invented by [[Riemann]]. Object space belongs to that class.

To the extent that it is reachable by scientifically acceptable probes, visual space as defined is also a candidate for such considerations. The first and remarkably prescient analysis was published by [[Ernst Mach]]&lt;ref&gt;Mach, E. (1906) ''Space and Geometry''. Open Court Publishing: Chicago&lt;/ref&gt; in 1901. Under the heading ''On Physiological as Distinguished from Geometrical Space'' Mach states that "Both spaces are threefold manifoldnesses" but the former is "...neither constituted everywhere and in all directions alike, nor infinite in extent, nor unbounded." A notable attempt at a rigorous formulation was made in 1947 by the highly talented mathematician [[Rudolf Luneburg]], who preceded his essay &lt;ref&gt;Luneburg, R.K. (1947). ''Mathematical Analysis of Binocular Vision''. Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; by a profound analysis of the underlying principles. When features are sufficiently singular and distinct, there is no problem about a correspondence between an individual item ''A'' in object space and its correlate ''A' '' in visual space. Questions can be asked and answered such as "If visual percepts ''A',B',C' '' are correlates of physical objects ''A,B,C,'' and if ''C'' lies between ''A'' and ''B'', does ''C' '' lie between ''A' '' and ''B' ''?" In this manner, the possibility of visual space being metrical can be approached. If the exercise is successful, a great deal can be said about the nature of the mapping of the physical space on the visual space.

On the basis of fragmentary psychophysical data of previous generations, Luneburg concluded that visual space was hyperbolic with constant curvature, meaning that elements can be moved throughout the space without changing shape. One of Luneburg's major arguments is that, in accord with a common observation, the transformation involving hyperbolic space renders infinity into a dome (the sky). The Luneburg proposition gave rise to discussions and attempts at corroborating experiments, which on the whole did not favor it.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 3 ''Geometry and Spatial Vision''. (2006) In M.R.M. Jenkin and L.R. Harris (Eds) ''Seeing Spatial Form''. Oxford U. Press. pp 35-41&lt;/ref&gt;

Basic to the problem, and underestimated by Luneburg the mathematician, is the likely success of a mathematically viable formulation of the relationship between objects in physical space and percepts in visual space. Any scientific investigation of visual space is colored by the kind of access we have to it, and the precision, repeatability and generality of measurements. Insightful questions can be asked about the mapping of visual space to object space &lt;ref&gt;Foley, J.M. (1964). Desarguesian property in visual space. ''Journal of the Optical Society of America'', 54 (5), 684-692.&lt;/ref&gt; but answers are mostly limited in the range of their validity. If the physical setting that satisfies the criterion of, say, apparent parallelism varies from observer to observer, or from day to day, or from context to context, so does the geometrical nature of, and hence mathematical formulation for, visual space.

All these arguments notwithstanding, there is a major concordance between the locations of items in object space and their correlates in visual space. It is adequately veridical for us to navigate very effectively in the world, deviations from such a situation are sufficiently notable to warrant special consideration. [[visual space agnosia]] is a recognized neurological condition, and the many common distortions, called [[geometrical-optical illusions]], are widely demonstrated but of minor consequence.

==Neural representation of space==

===Fechner's ''inner'' and ''outer'' psychophysics ===

Its founder, [[Gustav Theodor Fechner]] defined the mission of the discipline of [[psychophysics]] as the functional relationship between the mental and material worlds—in this particular case, the visual and object spaces—but he acknowledged an intermediate step, which has since blossomed into the major enterprise of modern neuroscience. In distinguishing between ''inner'' and ''outer'' psychophysics, Fechner recognized that a physical stimulus generates a percept by way of an effect on the organism's sensory and nervous systems. Hence, without denying that its essence is the arc between object and percept, the inquiry can concern itself with the neural substrate of visual space.

===Retinotopy and beyond===

Two major concepts dating back to the middle of the 19th century set the parameters of the discussion here. [[Johannes Peter Müller|Johannes Müller]] emphasized that what matters in a neural path is the connection it makes, and Hermann [[Lotze]], from psychological considerations, enunciated the principle of local sign. Put together in modern neuroanatomical terms they mean that a nerve fiber from a fixed retinal location instructs its target neurons in the brain about the presence of a stimulus in the location in the eye's visual field that is imaged there. The orderly array of retinal locations is preserved in the passage from the retina to the brain, and provides what is aptly called a "[[Retinotopy|retinotopic"]] mapping in the primary visual cortex. Thus in the first instance brain activity retains the relative spatial ordering of the objects and lays the foundations for a neural substrate of visual space. Unfortunately, as is so common in brain studies, simplicity and transparency ends here. Right at the outset, visual signals are analyzed not only for their position, but also, separately in parallel channels, for many other attributes such as brightness, color, orientation, depth. No single neuron or even neuronal center or circuit represents both the nature of a target feature and its accurate location. The unitary mapping of object space into the coherent visual space without internal contradictions or inconsistencies that we as observer automatically experience, demands concepts of conjoint activity in several parts of the nervous system that is at present beyond the reach of neurophysiological research.

===Place cells===

Though the details of the process by which the experience of visual space emerges remain opaque, a startling finding gives hope for future insights. Neural units have been demonstrated in the brain structure called [[hippocampus]] that show activity only when the animal is in a specific place in its environment{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}.

==Space and its content==
Only on an astronomical scale are physical space and its contents interdependent, This major proposition of the [[general relativity|general theory of relativity]] is of no concern in vision. For us, distances in object space are independent of the nature of the objects.

But this is not so simple in visual space. At a minim an observer judges the relative location of a few light points in an otherwise dark visual field, a simplistic extension from object space that enabled Luneburg to make some statements about the geometry of visual space. In a more richly textured visual world, the various visual percepts carry with them prior perceptual associations which often affect their relative spatial disposition. Identical separations in physical space can look quite different (''are quite different'' in visual space) depending on the features that demarcate them. This is particularly so in the depth dimension because the apparatus by which values in the third visual dimension are assigned is fundamentally different from that for the height and width of objects.

Even in monocular vision, which physiologically has only two dimensions, cues of size, perspective, relative motion etc. are used to [[Monocular depth cues|assign depth differences to percepts]]. Looked at as a mathematical/geometrical problem, expanding a 2-dimensional object manifold into a 3-dimensional visual world is "ill-posed," i.e., not capable of a rational solution, but is accomplished quite effectively by the human observer.

The problem becomes less ill-posed when [[binocular vision]] allows actual determination of relative depth by [[stereoscopy]], but its linkage to the evaluation of distance in the other two dimensions is uncertain (see: [[stereoscopic depth rendition]]). Hence, the uncomplicated three-dimensional visual space of every-day experience is the product of many perceptual and cognitive layers superimposed on the physiological representation of the physical world of objects.

There is no formal definition for the '''water-energy nexus''' - the concept refers to the relationship between the [[water]] used for [[energy production]],&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Spang, E. S., Moomaw, W. R., Gallagher, K. S., Kirshen, P. H., and Marks, D. H. (2014). "The water consumption of energy production: an international comparison." ''Environmental Research Letters'', 9(10), 105002.&lt;/ref&gt; including both [[electricity]] and sources of fuel such as [[petroleum|oil]] and [[natural gas]], and the energy consumed to extract, purify, deliver, heat/cool, treat and dispose of water (and wastewater) sometimes referred to as the [[energy intensity]] (EI). The relationship is not truly a closed loop as the water used for energy production need not be the same water that is processed using that energy, but all forms of energy production require some input of water making the relationship inextricable.

Among the first studies to evaluate the water and energy relationship was a [[life-cycle analysis]] conducted by [[Peter Gleick]] in 1994 that highlighted the interdependence and initiated the joint study of water and energy.&lt;ref&gt;Gleick, P. H. (1994). "Water and Energy." ''Annual Review of Energy and the Environment'', 19(1), 267-299.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 the [[US Department of Energy]] (DOE) released their report on the water-energy nexus citing the need for joint water-energy policies and better understanding of the nexus and its susceptibility to [[climate change]] as a matter of [[national security]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Bauer, D., Philbrick, M., and Vallario, B. (2014). "The Water-Energy Nexus: Challenges and Opportunities." U.S. Department of Energy.&lt;/ref&gt; The hybrid Sankey diagram in the DOE's 2014 water-energy nexus report summarizes water and [[energy flow (ecology)|energy flows]] in the US by sector, demonstrating [[interdependence]] as well as singling out [[Electric power|thermoelectric power]] as the single largest user of water, used mainly for cooling. 

==  Water Used for Energy Production ==
[[File:Spang-2014-The water consumption of energy production.tif|thumb|486x486px|Figure 1. Total WCEP by energy category, 2008]]
All types of energy generation consume water either to process the raw materials used in the facility, constructing and maintaining the plant, or to just generate the electricity itself. Renewable power sources such as [[Photovoltaic solar cell|photovoltaic solar]] and [[wind power]], which require little water to produce energy, require water in processing the raw materials to build. Water can either be ''used'' or ''consumed,'' and can be categorised as fresh, ground, surface, blue, grey or green among others.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Water is considered used if it does not reduce the supply of water to downstream users, i.e. water that is taken and returned to the same source (instream use), such as in thermoelectric plants that use water for cooling and are by far the largest users of water.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While used water is returned to the system for downstream uses, it has usually been degraded in some way, mainly due to thermal or chemical pollution, and the natural flow has been altered which does not factor into an assessment if only the quantity of water is considered. Water is consumed when it is removed completely from the system, such as by evaporation or consumption by crops or humans. When assessing water use all these factors must be considered as well as spatiotemporal considerations making precise determination of water use very difficult.

Spang et al. (2014) conducted a study looking at the water consumption for energy production (WCEP) internationally that both showed the variation in energy types produced across countries as well as the vast differences in efficiency of energy production per unit of water use (figure 1).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Operations of water distribution systems and power distribution systems under emergency conditions of limited power and water availability is an important consideration for improving the overall resilience of the water - energy nexus.

In Congress on Technical Advancement 2017 (pp. 1-9).&lt;/ref&gt; applied an optimization model for water - energy nexus system for a hypothetical regional level system which showed an improved resilience for several contingency scenarios.

== Energy Intensity ==

=== US (California) ===
In 2001 operating water systems in the US consumed approximately 3% of the total annual electricity (~75 TWh).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Cohen, R., Nelson, B., and Wolff, G. (2004). "Energy Down The Drain: The Hidden Costs of California’s Water Supply." E. Cousins, ed., Natural Resources Defense Council&lt;/ref&gt; The California's [[State Water Project]] (SWP) and [[Central Valley Project]] (CVP) are together the largest water system in the world with the highest water lift, over 2000&amp;nbsp;ft. across the [[Tehachapi mountains]], delivering water from the wetter and relatively rural north of the state, to the [[agricultural]]ly intensive central valley, and finally to the [[arid]] and heavily populated south. Consequently, the SWP and CVP are the single largest consumers of electricity in California consuming approximately 5 TWh of electricity each per year.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 2001, 19% of the state’s total electricity use (~48 TWh/year) was used in processing water including end uses, with the urban sector accounting for 65% of this.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Klein, G., Krebs, M., Hall, V., O’Brien, T., and Blevins, B. B. (2005). "California's Water – Energy Relationship." California Energy Commission, Sacramento, California.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to electricity, 30% of California’s natural gas consumption was due to water-related processes, mainly residential water heating, and 88 million gallons of diesel was consumed by groundwater pumps for agriculture.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The residential sector alone accounted for 48% of the total combined electricity and natural gas consumed for water-related processes in the state.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

According to the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) Energy Division’s Embedded Energy in Water Studies report:&lt;blockquote&gt;''“'[[Energy Intensity]]' refers to the average amount of energy needed to transport or treat water or wastewater on a per unit basis"''&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Energy Intensity is sometimes used synonymously with embedded or [[embodied energy]]. In 2005, water deliveries to Southern California were assessed to have an average EI of 12.7 MWh/MG, nearly two-thirds of which was due to transportation.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Following the findings that a fifth of California’s electricity is consumed in water-related processes including end-use,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; the CPUC responded by authorising a statewide study into the relationship between energy and water that was conducted by the California Institute for Energy and Environment (CIEE), and developed programs to save energy through water conservation.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Bennett, B., and Park, L. (2010). "Embedded Energy in Water Studies Study 1: Statewide and Regional Water-Energy Relationship." California Public Utilities Commission Energy Division.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, B., and Park, L. (2010). "Embedded Energy in Water Studies Study 2: Water Agency and Function Component Study and Embedded Energy- Water Load Profiles." California Public Utilities Commission Energy Division.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hydroelectricity ==
[[Hydroelectricity]] is a special case of water used for energy production mainly because hydroelectric power generation is regarded as being clean and [[renewable]], and dams (the main source of hydroelectric production) serve multiple purposes besides energy generation, including flood prevention, storage, control and recreation which make justifiable allocation analyses difficult.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Furthermore, the impacts of hydroelectric power generation can be hard to quantify both in terms of evaporative consumptive losses and altered quality of water, since damming results in flows that are much colder than for flowing streams. In some cases the moderation of flows can be seen as a rivalry of water use in time may also need to accounted for in impact analysis.

 --&gt;{{General relativity sidebar |phenomena}}

A '''wormhole''' (or '''Einstein–Rosen bridge''') is a speculative structure linking separate points in [[spacetime]], and is based on a [[Solutions of the Einstein field equations|solution of the Einstein field equations]]. A wormhole can be visualized as a tunnel with two ends, each at separate points in spacetime (i.e., different locations or different points of time). More precisely it is a transcendental bijection of the spacetime continuum, an asymptotic projection of the [[Calabi–Yau]] manifold manifesting itself in [[Anti-de Sitter space]]. 

Wormholes are consistent with the [[general theory of relativity]], but whether wormholes actually exist remains to be seen.

A wormhole could connect extremely long distances such as a billion [[light year]]s or more, short distances such as a few [[meter]]s, different [[multiverse|universes]], or different points in time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=1998-08-03|title=Focus: Wormhole Construction: Proceed with Caution|url=https://physics.aps.org/story/v2/st7|journal=Physics|language=en-US|volume=2|pages=|via=American Physical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Visualization ==
[[File:Wormhole-demo.png|thumb|Wormhole visualized]]
For a simplified notion of a wormhole, [[space]] can be visualized as a two-dimensional (2D) surface. In this case, a wormhole would appear as a hole in that surface, lead into a [[Three-dimensional space (mathematics)|3D]] tube (the inside surface of a [[cylinder]]), then re-emerge at another location on the 2D surface with a hole similar to the entrance. An actual wormhole would be analogous to this, but with the spatial dimensions raised by one. For example, instead of circular holes on a [[2D plane]], the entry and exit points could be visualized as spheres in [[3D space]].

Another way to imagine wormholes is to take a sheet of paper and draw two somewhat distant points on one side of the paper. The sheet of paper represents a plane in the [[Spacetime|spacetime continuum]], and the two points represent a distance to be traveled, however theoretically a wormhole could connect these two points by folding that plane so the points are touching. In this way it would be much easier to traverse the distance since the two points are now touching.


== Terminology ==
In 1928, [[Hermann Weyl]] proposed a wormhole hypothesis of matter in connection with mass analysis of [[electromagnetic field]] energy;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Weyl | first1 = H. | title = Feld und Materie | doi = 10.1002/andp.19213701405 | journal = Annalen der Physik | volume = 65 | issue = 14| year = 1921 | pages=541–563| bibcode = 1921AnP...370..541W }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scholz, Erhard  (ed.), ''Hermann Weyl's Raum - Zeit - Materie and a General Introduction to His Scientific Work'', 2001, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; however, he did not use the term "wormhole" (he spoke of "one-dimensional tubes" instead).&lt;ref name=SEP&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/weyl/ "Hermann Weyl"]: entry in the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

American [[theoretical physicist]] [[John Archibald Wheeler]] (inspired by Weyl's work)&lt;ref name=SEP/&gt; coined the term "wormhole" in a 1957 paper co-authored by [[Charles Misner]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Misner | first1 = C. W. | last2 = Wheeler | first2 = J. A. | title = Classical physics as geometry | doi = 10.1016/0003-4916(57)90049-0 | journal = Ann. Phys. | volume = 2 | issue = 6 | page = 525| year = 1957 | bibcode = 1957AnPhy...2..525M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|This analysis forces one to consider situations... where there is a net flux of lines of force, through what [[topologist]]s would call "a [[Handle decomposition|handle]]" of the multiply-connected space, and what physicists might perhaps be excused for more vividly terming a "wormhole".|Charles Misner and John Wheeler in ''[[Annals of Physics]]''}}

=== Modern definitions ===
Wormholes have been defined both [[Geometry and topology|''geometrically'' and ''topologically'']].{{elucidate|are these definitions equivalent?|date=March 2017}} From a topological point of view, an intra-universe wormhole (a wormhole between two points in the same universe) is a [[Compact space|compact]] region of spacetime whose boundary is topologically trivial, but whose interior is not [[simply connected]]. Formalizing this idea leads to definitions such as the following, taken from [[Matt Visser]]'s ''Lorentzian Wormholes'' (1996).&lt;ref name="Visser1996" /&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2018}}

{{quote|If a [[Minkowski space]]time contains a compact region Ω, and if the topology of Ω is of the form Ω ~ R × Σ, where Σ is a three-manifold of the nontrivial topology, whose boundary has topology of the form ∂Σ ~ S&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and if, furthermore, the [[hypersurface]]s Σ are all spacelike, then the region Ω contains a quasipermanent intrauniverse wormhole.}}

Geometrically, wormholes can be described as regions of spacetime that constrain the incremental deformation of closed surfaces. For example, in Enrico Rodrigo's ''The Physics of Stargates, ''a wormhole is defined informally as: {{quote|a region of spacetime containing a "[[world tube]]" (the time evolution of a closed surface) that cannot be continuously deformed (shrunk) to a [[world line]] (the time evolution of a point).}}

The equations of the theory of [[general relativity]] have valid solutions that contain wormholes. The first type of wormhole solution discovered was the ''Schwarzschild wormhole''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;,&lt;ref name=Dobrev&gt;Vladimir Dobrev (ed.), ''Lie Theory and Its Applications in Physics: Varna, Bulgaria, June 2015'', Springer, 2016, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt; which would be present in the [[Schwarzschild metric]] describing an ''eternal black hole'', but it was found that it would collapse too quickly for anything to cross from one end to the other. Wormholes that could be crossed in both directions, known as [[Wormhole#Traversable wormholes|traversable wormholes]], would only be possible if [[exotic matter]] with negative [[energy density]] could be used to stabilize them.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

[[File:FY221c15.png|thumb|An artist's impression of a wormhole from an observer's perspective, crossing the [[event horizon]] of a Schwarzschild wormhole that bridges two different universes. The observer originates from the right, and another universe becomes visible in the center of the wormhole's shadow once the horizon is crossed, the observer seeing light that has fallen into the [[black hole]] interior region from the other universe; however, this other universe is unreachable in the case of a Schwarzschild wormhole, as the bridge always collapses before the observer has time to cross it, and everything that has fallen through the event horizon of either universe is inevitably crushed in the [[Gravitational singularity|singularity]].]]

Schwarzschild wormholes, also known as ''Einstein–Rosen bridges''&lt;ref name=Dobrev/&gt; (named after [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Nathan Rosen]]),&lt;ref name=ER/&gt; are connections between areas of space that can be modeled as [[vacuum solution]]s to the [[Einstein field equations]], and that are now understood to be intrinsic parts of the [[Kruskal–Szekeres coordinates#The maximally extended Schwarzschild solution|maximally extended]] version of the [[Schwarzschild metric]] describing an eternal black hole with no charge and no rotation. Here, "maximally extended" refers to the idea that the [[spacetime]] should not have any "edges": it should be possible to continue this path arbitrarily far into the particle's future or past for any possible trajectory of a free-falling particle (following a [[geodesic]] in the spacetime).

In order to satisfy this requirement, it turns out that in addition to the black hole interior region that particles enter when they fall through the [[event horizon]] from the outside, there must be a separate [[white hole]] interior region that allows us to extrapolate the trajectories of particles that an outside observer sees rising up ''away'' from the event horizon. And just as there are two separate interior regions of the maximally extended spacetime, there are also two separate exterior regions, sometimes called two different "universes", with the second universe allowing us to extrapolate some possible particle trajectories in the two interior regions. This means that the interior black hole region can contain a mix of particles that fell in from either universe (and thus an observer who fell in from one universe might be able to see light that fell in from the other one), and likewise particles from the interior white hole region can escape into either universe. All four regions can be seen in a spacetime diagram that uses [[Kruskal–Szekeres coordinates]].

In this spacetime, it is possible to come up with [[coordinate system]]s such that if a [[hypersurface]] of constant time (a set of points that all have the same time coordinate, such that every point on the surface has a [[space-like]] separation, giving what is called a 'space-like surface') is picked and an "embedding diagram" drawn depicting the curvature of space at that time, the embedding diagram will look like a tube connecting the two exterior regions, known as an "Einstein&amp;ndash;Rosen bridge". Note that the Schwarzschild metric describes an idealized black hole that exists eternally from the perspective of external observers; a more realistic black hole that forms at some particular time from a collapsing star would require a different metric. When the infalling stellar matter is added to a diagram of a black hole's history, it removes the part of the diagram corresponding to the white hole interior region, along with the part of the diagram corresponding to the other universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://casa.colorado.edu/~ajsh/collapse.html#kruskal |title=Collapse to a Black Hole |publisher=Casa.colorado.edu |date=2010-10-03 |accessdate=2010-11-11}}{{tertiary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Einstein&amp;ndash;Rosen bridge was discovered by [[Ludwig Flamm]] in 1916,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flamm|title=Beiträge zur Einsteinschen Gravitationstheorie|date=1916|journal=[[Physikalische Zeitschrift]]|volume=XVII|page=448}} ("Comments on Einstein's Theory of Gravity")&lt;/ref&gt; a few months after Schwarzschild published his solution, and was rediscovered by Albert Einstein and his colleague Nathan Rosen, who published their result in 1935.&lt;ref name=ER&gt;A. Einstein and N. Rosen, "The Particle Problem in the General Theory of Relativity," ''Phys. Rev.'' '''48'''(73) (1935).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="focus032505"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lindley|first1=David|title=Focus: The Birth of Wormholes|url=http://physics.aps.org/story/v15/st11|website=Physics|publisher=American Physical Society|accessdate=20 February 2016|date=Mar 25, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1962, [[John Archibald Wheeler]] and [[Robert W. Fuller]] published a paper&lt;ref&gt;R. W. Fuller and J. A. Wheeler, "Causality and Multiply-Connected Space-Time," ''Phys. Rev.'' '''128'''(919) (1962).&lt;/ref&gt; showing that this type of wormhole is unstable if it connects two parts of the same universe, and that it will pinch off too quickly for light (or any particle moving slower than light) that falls in from one exterior region to make it to the other exterior region.

According to general relativity, the [[gravitational collapse]] of a sufficiently compact mass forms a singular Schwarzschild black hole. In the [[Einstein–Cartan theory|Einstein–Cartan]]–Sciama–Kibble theory of gravity, however, it forms a regular Einstein–Rosen bridge. This theory extends general relativity by removing a constraint of the symmetry of the [[affine connection]] and regarding its antisymmetric part, the [[torsion tensor]], as a dynamical variable. Torsion naturally accounts for the quantum-mechanical, intrinsic angular momentum ([[spin (physics)|spin]]) of matter. The minimal coupling between torsion and [[Dirac spinor]]s generates a repulsive spin–spin interaction that is significant in fermionic matter at extremely high densities. Such an interaction prevents the formation of a gravitational singularity.{{clarify|date=April 2015}} Instead, the collapsing matter reaches an enormous but finite density and rebounds, forming the other side of the bridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Poplawski, Nikodem J. |authorlink=Nikodem Popławski |year=2010 |title=Cosmology with torsion: An alternative to cosmic inflation |journal=Phys. Lett. B |volume=694 |issue=3 |pages=181–185 |doi=10.1016/j.physletb.2010.09.056|arxiv = 1007.0587 |bibcode = 2010PhLB..694..181P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Schwarzschild wormholes are not traversable in both directions, their existence inspired [[Kip Thorne]] to imagine traversable wormholes created by holding the "throat" of a Schwarzschild wormhole open with [[exotic matter]] (material that has negative mass/energy).

Other non-traversable wormholes include ''Lorentzian wormholes'' (first proposed by John Archibald Wheeler in 1957), wormholes creating a [[spacetime foam]] in a general relativistic spacetime manifold depicted by a [[Lorentzian manifold]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=J.

Lorentzian traversable wormholes would allow travel in both directions from one part of the universe to another part of that same universe very quickly or would allow travel from one universe to another. {{anchor|Ellis-Bronnikov precedence}}&lt;!--'Ellis wormhole' redirects here--&gt;The possibility of traversable wormholes in general relativity was first demonstrated in a 1973 paper by Homer Ellis&lt;ref name="ellis1"&gt;

Ellis thoroughly analyzed the topology and the [[geodesic]]s of the [[Ellis drainhole]], showing it to be geodesically complete, horizonless, singularity-free, and fully traversable in both directions.  The drainhole is a solution manifold of Einstein's field equations for a vacuum space-time, modified by inclusion of a scalar field minimally coupled to the [[Ricci tensor]] with antiorthodox polarity (negative instead of positive).  (Ellis specifically rejected referring to the scalar field as 'exotic' because of the antiorthodox coupling, finding arguments for doing so unpersuasive.)  The solution depends on two parameters: &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, which fixes the strength of its gravitational field, and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, which determines the curvature of its spatial cross sections.  When &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is set equal to 0, the drainhole's gravitational field vanishes.  What is left is the [[Ellis wormhole]], a nongravitating, purely geometric, traversable wormhole.
[[Kip Thorne]] and his graduate student [[Mike Morris (physicist)|Mike Morris]], unaware of the 1973 papers by Ellis and Bronnikov,  manufactured, and in 1988 published, a duplicate of the Ellis wormhole for use as a tool for teaching general relativity. For this reason, the type of traversable wormhole they proposed, held open by a spherical shell of [[exotic matter]], was from 1988 to 2015 exclusively referred to in the literature as a ''Morris–Thorne wormhole''. Later, other types of traversable wormholes were discovered as allowable solutions to the equations of general relativity, including a variety analyzed in a 1989 paper by [[Matt Visser]], in which a path through the wormhole can be made where the traversing path does not pass through a region of exotic matter. However, in the pure [[Gauss–Bonnet gravity]] (a modification to general relativity involving extra spatial dimensions which is sometimes studied in the context of [[brane cosmology]]) exotic matter is not needed in order for wormholes to exist—they can exist even with no matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Elias Gravanis|author2=Steven Willison|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.75.084025|year=2007|title='Mass without mass' from thin shells in Gauss-Bonnet gravity|issue=8|pages=084025|volume=75|journal=Phys.

Cramer|Cramer]] ''et al.'',&lt;ref name="naturalwormholes"/&gt; in which it was proposed that such wormholes could have been naturally created in the early universe.

Wormholes connect two points in spacetime, which means that they would in principle allow [[time travel|travel in time]], as well as in space. In 1988, Morris, Thorne and Yurtsever worked out explicitly how to convert a wormhole traversing space into one traversing time by accelerating one of its two mouths.&lt;ref name="time travel"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.61.1446|title=Wormholes, Time Machines, and the Weak Energy Condition|date=1988|last1=Morris|first1=Michael|last2=Thorne|first2=Kip|last3=Yurtsever|first3=Ulvi|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=61|issue=13|pages=1446–1449|url=http://authors.library.caltech.edu/9262/1/MORprl88.pdf|pmid=10038800|bibcode=1988PhRvL..61.1446M}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to general relativity, it would not be possible to use a wormhole to travel back to a time earlier than when the wormhole was first converted into a time 'machine'. Until this time it could not have been noticed or have been used.&lt;ref name="Thorne1994" /&gt;{{Rp|504}}

== Raychaudhuri's theorem and exotic matter ==
To see why [[exotic matter]] is required, consider an incoming light front traveling along geodesics, which then crosses the wormhole and re-expands on the other side. The [[congruence (general relativity)|expansion]] goes from negative to positive. As the wormhole neck is of finite size, we would not expect caustics to develop, at least within the vicinity of the neck. According to the optical [[Raychaudhuri's theorem]], this requires a violation of the [[averaged null energy condition]]. Quantum effects such as the [[Casimir effect]] cannot violate the averaged null energy condition in any neighborhood of space with zero curvature,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fewster|first=Christopher J.|author2=Ken D.

==Modified general relativity==
In some hypotheses where [[Alternatives to general relativity|general relativity is modified]], it is possible to have a wormhole that does not collapse without having to resort to exotic matter. For example, this is possible with R^2 gravity, a form of [[f(R) gravity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=1506.00988|title=Exotica ex nihilo: Traversable wormholes &amp; non-singular black holes from the vacuum of quadratic gravity|journal=Physical Review D|volume=92|issue=4|pages=043516|last1=Duplessis|first1=Francis|last2= Easson|first2=Damien A.|year=2015|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.92.043516|bibcode=2015PhRvD..92d3516D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Faster-than-light travel ==

[[File:Wormhole travel as envisioned by Les Bossinas for NASA.jpg|alt=Wormhole travel as envisioned by Les Bossinas for NASA Digital art by Les Bossinas (Cortez III Service Corp.), 1998|thumb|Wormhole travel as envisioned by Les Bossinas for [[NASA]]]]

The impossibility of faster-than-light relative speed only applies locally. Wormholes might allow effective superluminal ([[faster-than-light]]) travel by ensuring that the speed of light is not exceeded locally at any time. While traveling through a wormhole, subluminal (slower-than-light) speeds are used. If two points are connected by a wormhole whose length is shorter than the distance between them ''outside'' the wormhole, the time taken to traverse it could be less than the time it would take a light beam to make the journey if it took a path through the space ''outside'' the wormhole. However, a light beam traveling through the same wormhole would of course beat the traveler.

== Time travel ==
{{main|Time travel}}

If [[#Traversable wormholes|traversable wormholes]] exist, they could allow [[time travel]].&lt;ref name="time travel"/&gt; A proposed time-travel machine using a traversable wormhole would hypothetically work in the following way: One end of the wormhole is accelerated to some significant fraction of the speed of light, perhaps with some advanced [[Vehicle propulsion|propulsion system]], and then brought back to the point of origin. Alternatively, another way is to take one entrance of the wormhole and move it to within the gravitational field of an object that has higher gravity than the other entrance, and then return it to a position near the other entrance. For both of these methods, [[time dilation]] causes the end of the wormhole that has been moved to have aged less, or become "younger", than the stationary end as seen by an external observer; however, time connects differently ''through'' the wormhole than ''outside'' it, so that [[Synchronization|synchronized]] clocks at either end of the wormhole will always remain synchronized as seen by an observer passing through the wormhole, no matter how the two ends move around.&lt;ref name="Thorne1994"&gt;{{cite book | last = Thorne | first = Kip S. | authorlink = Kip Thorne | title = Black Holes and Time Warps | publisher = W.

Norton | year= 1994 | isbn = 978-0-393-31276-8| title-link = Black Holes and Time Warps }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|502}} This means that an observer entering the "younger" end would exit the "older" end at a time when it was the same age as the "younger" end, effectively going back in time as seen by an observer from the outside. One significant limitation of such a time machine is that it is only possible to go as far back in time as the initial creation of the machine;&lt;ref name="Thorne1994" /&gt;{{rp|503}} It is more of a path through time rather than it is a device that itself moves through time, and it would not allow the technology itself to be moved backward in time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|eprint=gr-qc/0503097|title=Wormholes and Time Travel?

According to current theories on the nature of wormholes, construction of a traversable wormhole would require the existence of a substance with negative energy, often referred to as "[[exotic matter]]". More technically, the wormhole spacetime requires a distribution of energy that violates various [[energy condition]]s, such as the null energy condition along with the weak, strong, and dominant energy conditions. However, it is known that quantum effects can lead to small measurable violations of the null energy condition,&lt;ref name="Visser1996"&gt;{{cite book | last = Visser | first = Matt | authorlink = Matt Visser | title = Lorentzian Wormholes | publisher = Springer-Verlag | year= 1996 | isbn = 978-1-56396-653-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|101}} and many physicists believe that the required negative energy may actually be possible due to the [[Casimir effect]] in quantum physics.&lt;ref name="casimir"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.npl.washington.edu/av/altvw69.html |title=NASA Goes FTL Part 1: Wormhole Physics |website=Analog Science Fiction &amp; Fact Magazine|year=1994|accessdate=December 2, 2006|last1=Cramer|first1=John G. |authorlink=John G.

In 1993, [[Matt Visser]] argued that the two mouths of a wormhole with such an induced clock difference could not be brought together without inducing quantum field and gravitational effects that would either make the wormhole collapse or the two mouths repel each other,&lt;ref name="visser_1"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Matt | last = Visser | authorlink = Matt Visser | title = From wormhole to time machine: Comments on Hawking's Chronology Protection Conjecture | journal = Physical Review D | volume = 47 | year = 1993 | issue = 2 | pages = 554–565 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevD.47.554| arxiv=hep-th/9202090|bibcode = 1993PhRvD..47..554V }}&lt;/ref&gt; or otherwise prevent information from passing through the wormhole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|eprint=gr-qc/0204022|title=The quantum physics of chronology protection|last1=Visser|first1=Matt|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, the two mouths could not be brought close enough for [[causality (physics)|causality]] violation to take place. However, in a 1997 paper, Visser hypothesized that a complex "[[Roman ring]]" (named after Tom Roman) configuration of an N number of wormholes arranged in a symmetric polygon could still act as a time machine, although he concludes that this is more likely a flaw in classical quantum gravity theory rather than proof that causality violation is possible.&lt;ref name="visser_2"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Matt | last = Visser | authorlink = Matt Visser | title = Traversable wormholes: the Roman ring | journal = Physical Review D | volume = 55 | year = 1997 | issue = 8 | pages = 5212–5214 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevD.55.5212| arxiv=gr-qc/9702043|bibcode = 1997PhRvD..55.5212V }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interuniversal travel&lt;!--'Interuniversal travel', 'Inter-universal travel' and 'Everett phone' redirect here--&gt; ==
A possible resolution to the paradoxes resulting from wormhole-enabled time travel rests on the [[many-worlds interpretation]] of [[quantum mechanics]].

In 1991 [[David Deutsch]] showed that quantum theory is fully consistent (in the sense that the so-called [[density matrix]] can be made free of discontinuities) in spacetimes with closed timelike curves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Deutsch|first=David |title=Quantum Mechanics Near Closed Timelike Lines|date=1991|journal=[[Physical Review D]]|volume=44|issue=10|page=3197|doi= 10.1103/PhysRevD.44.3197|bibcode=1991PhRvD..44.3197D}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, later it was shown that such model of closed timelike curve can have internal inconsistencies as it will lead to strange phenomena like distinguishing non-orthogonal quantum states and distinguishing proper and improper mixture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Brun|display-authors=etal |title=Localized Closed Timelike Curves Can Perfectly Distinguish Quantum States|date=2009|journal=[[Physical Review Letters]]|volume=102|issue=21|page=210402|doi= 10.1103/PhysRevLett.102.210402|bibcode=2009PhRvL.102u0402B|pmid=19519086|arxiv=0811.1209}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Pati |author2=Chakrabarty|author3=Agrawal|title=Purification of mixed states with closed timelike curve is not possible|date=2011|journal=[[Physical Review A]]|volume=84|issue=6|page=062325|doi= 10.1103/PhysRevA.84.062325|bibcode = 2011PhRvA..84f2325P |arxiv = 1003.4221 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, the destructive positive feedback loop of virtual particles circulating through a wormhole time machine, a result indicated by semi-classical calculations, is averted. A particle returning from the future does not return to its universe of origination but to a parallel universe. This suggests that a wormhole time machine with an exceedingly short time jump is a theoretical bridge between contemporaneous parallel universes.&lt;ref name="Rodrigo2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rodrigo|first=Enrico|title=The Physics of Stargates|publisher=Eridanus Press|date= 2010|page=281|isbn= 978-0-9841500-0-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because a wormhole time-machine introduces a type of nonlinearity into quantum theory, this sort of communication between parallel universes is consistent with [[Joseph Polchinski]]'s proposal of an '''Everett phone'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Polchinski|first=Joseph |title=Weinberg's Nonlinear quantum Mechanics and the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen Paradox|journal=[[Physical Review Letters]]|volume=66|issue=4|pages=397–400 |date=1991 |bibcode=1991PhRvL..66..397P|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.66.397 |pmid=10043797}}&lt;/ref&gt; (named after [[Hugh Everett III|Hugh Everett]]) in [[Steven Weinberg]]'s formulation of nonlinear quantum mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;Enrico Rodrigo, ''The Physics of Stargates: Parallel Universes, Time Travel, and the Enigma of Wormhole Physics'', Eridanus Press, 2010, p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt;

The possibility of communication between parallel universes has been dubbed '''interuniversal travel'''.&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Walker, [https://www.newscientist.com/letter/mg23331111-100-14-interuniversal-travel-i-wouldnt-start-from-here/ "Inter-universal travel: I wouldn't start from here], ''[[New Scientist]]'' (1 February 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Metrics ==
Theories of ''wormhole metrics'' describe the spacetime geometry of a wormhole and serve as theoretical models for time travel. An example of a (traversable) wormhole [[metric tensor|metric]] is the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Raine |first1=Derek |last2=Thomas |first2=Edwin |date=2009 |title= Black Holes: An Introduction |publisher=Imperial College Press |page=143 |isbn=978-1-84816-383-6 | edition=2nd|doi=10.1142/p637 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

first presented by Ellis (see [[Ellis wormhole]]) as a special case of the [[Ellis drainhole]].

One type of non-traversable wormhole [[metric tensor|metric]] is the [[Schwarzschild metric|Schwarzschild solution]] (see the first diagram):

The original Einstein–Rosen bridge was described in an article published in July 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Einstein|first1=A.|last2=Rosen|first2=N.|title=The Particle Problem in the General Theory of Relativity|journal=Physical Review|date=1 July 1935|volume=48|issue=1|pages=73–77|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.48.73|bibcode = 1935PhRv...48...73E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBPpRqxY8Uw|title=Leonard Susskind {{!}} 'ER = EPR' or 'What's Behind the Horizons of Black Holes?'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

We call such a connection between the two sheets a "bridge".|author=A. Einstein, N. Rosen, "The Particle Problem in the General Theory of Relativity"}}

For the combined field, gravity and electricity, Einstein and Rosen derived the following Schwarzschild static spherically symmetric solution
:&lt;math&gt;\phi_{1} = \phi_{2} = \phi_{3} = 0, \phi_{4} = \frac{\epsilon}{4},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;ds^2 = - \frac{1}{( 1 - \frac{2m}{r} - \frac{\epsilon^2}{2 r^2})} dr^2 - r^2 (d\theta^2 + \sin^2 \theta \, d\phi^2) +
(1 - \frac{2m}{r} - \frac{\epsilon^2}{2 r^2}) dt^2&lt;/math&gt;
(&lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; = electrical charge)

The field equations without denominators in the case when &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; = 0 can be written
:&lt;math&gt;\phi_{\mu \nu} = \phi_{\mu,\nu} - \phi_{\nu,\mu}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;g^2 \phi_{\mu\nu;\sigma}g^{\nu\sigma} = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;g^2 (R_{ik} + \phi_{i\alpha}\phi_{k}^{\alpha} - \frac{1}{4} g_{ik} \phi_{\alpha\beta}\phi^{ab}) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

In order to eliminate singularities, if one replaces &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; according to the equation:
:&lt;math&gt;u^2 = r^2 - \frac{\epsilon^2}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

and with &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; = 0 one obtains&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/09/150903081506.htm|title=Magnetic wormhole connecting two regions of space created for the first time}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uab.cat/web/newsroom/news-detail/magnetic-wormhole-created-for-first-time-1345668003610.html?noticiaid=1345689132054|title=Magnetic wormhole created for first time}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\phi_{1} = \phi_{2} = \phi_{3} = 0,  \phi_{4} = \epsilon / (u^2 + \frac{\epsilon^2}{2})^\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;ds^2 = - du^2 - (u^2 + \frac{\epsilon^2}{2})(d \theta^2 + \sin^2 \theta \, d\phi^2) + (\frac{2 u^2}{2 u^2 + \epsilon^2})dt^2&lt;/math&gt;

{{Main| Wormholes in fiction}}
Wormholes are a common element in [[science fiction]] because they allow interstellar, intergalactic, and sometimes even interuniversal travel within human lifetime scales. In fiction, wormholes have also served as a method for time travel.
