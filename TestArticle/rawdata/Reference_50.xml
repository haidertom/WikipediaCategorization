{{Use mdy dates|date=November 2016}}

An '''acronym''' is a [[word]] or name formed as an [[abbreviation]] from the initial components of a phrase or a word, usually individual letters (as in ''[[NATO]]'' or ''[[laser]]'') and sometimes syllables (as in ''[[Benelux]]'').

There are no universal standards for the [[#Nomenclature|multiple names for such abbreviations]] or for their [[#Orthographic styling|orthographic styling]]. In English and most other languages, such abbreviations historically had limited use, but they became much more common in the 20th century. Acronyms are a type of [[word formation]] process, and they are viewed as a subtype of [[Blend word|blend]]ing.

==Nomenclature==

Whereas an [[abbreviation]] may be any type of shortened form, such as words with the middle omitted (for example, ''Rd'' for ''road'' or ''Dr'' for ''[[Doctor (title)|Doctor]]''), an acronym is a word formed from the first letter or first few letters of each word in a phrase (such as ''[[sonar]]'', created from ''{{uu|so}}und {{uu|na}}vigation and {{uu|r}}anging''). Attestations for ''{{lang|de|Akronym}}'' in German are known from 1921, and for ''acronym'' in English from 1940.&lt;ref name="Paris_Gazette_and_Brockhaus_Handbuch"&gt;
Paris Gazette, by Lion Feuchtwanger; translated (from Exil) by Willa and Edwin Muir, New York, Viking Press, 1940. Chapter 47, Beasts of Prey, pp.{{nbsp}}665–66:
&lt;blockquote&gt;His first glance at the ''Paris German News'' told Wiesener that this new paper was nothing like the old ''P.G.''. "They can call it the ''P.G.N.'' if they like", he thought, "but that's the only difference. Pee-gee-enn; what's the word for words like that, made out of initials? My memory is beginning to fail me. Just the other day there was a technical expression I couldn't remember. I must be growing old. "''P.G.'' or ''P.G.N.'', it's six of one and half a dozen of the other.... Pee-gee-enn. It's an acronym, that's what it is. That's what they call words made up of initials. So I remember it after all; that's at least something.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
For "Akronym" used in 1921 or 1922, giving an example of "Agfa" film: Brockhaus Handbuch des Wissens in vier Bänden. Leipzig, F. A. Brockhaus, [1922–23, c1921–23] v.&amp;nbsp;1, p.&amp;nbsp;37.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Initialisms}}Although the word ''acronym'' is often used to refer to any abbreviation formed from initial letters,&lt;ref name="MWDEU"&gt;Merriam-Webster, Inc. ''Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of English Usage'', 1994. {{ISBN|0-87779-132-5}}. pp. 21–22:
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''acronyms'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;A number of commentators (as Copperud 1970, Janis 1984, Howard 1984) believe that acronyms can be differentiated from other abbreviations in being pronounceable as words. Dictionaries, however, do not make this distinction because writers in general do not:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The powder metallurgy industry has officially adopted the acronym 'P/M Parts'"—''Precision Metal Molding'', January 1966.&lt;br /&gt;"Users of the term ''acronym'' make no distinction between those pronounced as words ... and those pronounced as a series of characters" —Jean Praninskas, ''Trade Name Creation'', 1968.&lt;br /&gt;"It is not J.C.B.'s fault that its name, let alone its acronym, is not a household word among European scholars"—''Times Literary Supp.'' 5 February 1970.&lt;br /&gt;"...&amp;nbsp;the confusion in the Pentagon about abbreviations and acronyms—words formed from the first letters of other words"—Bernard Weinraub, ''N.Y. Times'', 11 December 1978. &lt;/blockquote&gt;Pyles &amp; Algeo 1970 divide acronyms into "initialisms", which consists of initial letters pronounced with the letter names, and "word acronyms", which are pronounced as words. ''Initialism'', an older word than ''acronym'', seems to be too little known to the general public to serve as the customary term standing in contrast with ''acronym'' in a narrow sense.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; some dictionaries and usage commentators define ''acronym'' to mean an abbreviation that is pronounced as a word,{{refn|&lt;ref name = "Oxford"&gt;"acronym".

Acronyms are often distinguished from initialisms like FBI and NIH, whose individual letters are pronounced as separate syllables.

The distinction is not well-maintained. According to ''Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of English Usage'':&lt;ref name="MWDEU" /&gt; "A number of commentators ... believe that acronyms can be differentiated from other abbreviations in being pronounceable as words. Dictionaries, however, do not make this distinction because writers in general do not. ... ''Initialism'', an older word than ''acronym'', seems to be too little known to the general public to serve as the customary term standing in contrast with ''acronym'' in a narrow sense."  About the use of ''acronym'' to only mean those pronounced as words, ''Fowler's Modern English Usage'' (3rd ed.) states:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Fowler's Modern English Usage |edition=Third Revised |editor-first=R.

Thus ''EC'' (European Community), ''FBI'' (Federal Bureau of Investigation), and ''VCR'' (videocassette recorder). Such terms are also called ''initialisms''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The limitations of the term being not widely known to the general public, ''acronym'' is also often applied to abbreviations that are familiar but are not pronounceable as words. ... Such terms are also called ''initialisms''."

A clearer distinction has also been drawn by Pyles &amp; Algeo (1970),&lt;ref name="MWDEU" /&gt; who divided ''acronyms'' as a general category into ''word acronyms'' pronounced as words, and ''initialisms'' sounded out as letters.&lt;!--Better to obtain and cite the original source rather than MW's summary of it, but it's good enough for now per [[WP:SAYWHEREYOUGOTIT]].--&gt;

There is no special term for abbreviations whose pronunciation involves the combination of letter names and words or word-like pronunciations of strings of letters, such as ''[[JPEG]]'' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|eɪ|p|ɛ|ɡ}} and ''[[MS-DOS]]'' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɛ|m|ɛ|s|ˈ|d|ɒ|s}}.  There is also some disagreement as to what to call abbreviations that some speakers pronounce as letters and others pronounce as a word. For example, the terms ''[[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]]'' and ''[[Individual Retirement Account|IRA]]'' can be pronounced as individual letters: {{IPAc-en|ˌ|juː|ˌ|ɑːr|ˈ|ɛ|l}} and {{IPAc-en|ˌ|aɪ|ˌ|ɑːr|ˈ|eɪ}}, respectively; or as a single word: {{IPAc-en|ɜːr|l}} and {{IPAc-en|ˈ|aɪ|r|ə}}, respectively.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

==Historical and current use==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2015}}
Acronymy, like [[retronym]]y, is a linguistic process that has existed throughout history but for which there was little to no [[Metalanguage|naming]], conscious attention, or [[Linguistics|systematic analysis]] until relatively recent times. Like retronymy, it became much more common in the 20th century than it had formerly been.

Ancient examples of acronymy (regardless of whether there was [[metalanguage]] at the time to describe it) include the following:
* Acronyms were used in Rome before the Christian era. For example, the official name for the Roman Empire, and the Republic before it, was abbreviated as ''[[SPQR]]'' (''{{lang|la|Senatus Populusque Romanus}}''). Inscriptions dating from antiquity, both on stone and on coins, use a lot of abbreviations and acronyms to save room and work. For example, [[praenomen|Roman first names]], of which there was only a small set, were almost always abbreviated. Common terms were abbreviated too, such as writing just "F" for ''{{lang|la|filius}}'', meaning "son of", a very common part of memorial inscriptions mentioning people. Grammatical markers were abbreviated or left out entirely if they could be inferred from the rest of the text.
* So-called ''{{lang|la|[[nomina sacra]]}}'' were used in many Greek biblical manuscripts. The common words "God" ({{lang|grc|Θεός}}), "Jesus" ({{lang|grc|Ιησούς}}), "Christ" ({{lang|grc|Χριστός}}), and some others, would be abbreviated by their first and last letters, marked with an overline. This was just one of many kinds of conventional scribal abbreviation, used to reduce the time-consuming workload of the scribe and save on valuable writing materials. The same convention is still commonly used in the inscriptions on religious [[icon]]s and the stamps used to mark the eucharistic bread in [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Churches]].
* The early Christians in Rome, most of whom were Greek rather than Latin speakers, used the image of a fish as a symbol for [[Jesus]] in part because of an acronym—''fish'' in Greek is ''{{transl|grc|[[ichthys]]}}'' ({{lang|grc|ΙΧΘΥΣ}}), which was said to stand for {{lang|grc|Ἰησοῦς Χριστός Θεοῦ Υἱός Σωτήρ}} (''{{transl|grc|Iesous CHristos THeou hUios Soter}}'': "Jesus Christ, God's Son, Savior"). This interpretation dates from the 2nd and 3rd centuries and is preserved in the [[catacombs]] of Rome. And for centuries, the Church has used the inscription ''[[INRI]]'' over the crucifix, which stands for the Latin ''{{lang|la|Iesus Nazarenus Rex Iudaeorum}}'' ("Jesus the Nazarene, King of the Jews").
* The Hebrew language has a long history of formation of acronyms pronounced as words, stretching back many centuries. The Hebrew Bible ("Old Testament") is known as "[[Tanakh]]", an acronym composed from the Hebrew initial letters of its three major sections: [[Torah]] (five books of Moses), [[Nevi'im]] (prophets), and [[K'tuvim]] (writings). Many rabbinical figures from the Middle Ages onward are referred to in rabbinical literature by their pronounced acronyms, such as [[Maimonides|Rambam]] and [[Rashi]] from the initial letters of their full Hebrew names: Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon and Rabbi Shlomo Yitzkhaki.

During the mid- to late-19th century, an acronym-disseminating trend spread through the American and European business communities: abbreviating [[corporation]] names in places where space was limited for writing—such as on the sides of [[railroad car]]s (e.g., Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad → RF&amp;P); on the sides of barrels and crates; and on [[ticker tape]] and in the small-print newspaper stock listings that got their data from it (e.g., American Telephone and Telegraph Company → AT&amp;T). Some well-known commercial examples dating from the 1890s through 1920s include [[Nabisco]] (National Biscuit Company),&lt;ref name=Davenport/&gt; [[Esso]] (from S.O., from [[Standard Oil]]), and [[Sunoco]] (Sun Oil Company).

Another driver for the adoption of acronyms was modern warfare with its many highly technical terms. While there is no recorded use of military acronyms in documents dating from the [[American Civil War]] (acronyms such as [[Army of Northern Virginia|ANV]] for "Army of Northern Virginia" post-date the war itself), they had become somewhat common in [[World War I]] and were very much a part even of the vernacular language of the soldiers during [[World War II]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/baloney.php|title=Baloney|website=www.etymonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; who themselves were referred to as [[G.I. (military)|G.I.]]s.

The widespread, frequent use of acronyms across the whole range of [[Register (sociolinguistics)|registers]] is a relatively new linguistic phenomenon in most languages, becoming increasingly evident since the mid-20th century. As literacy rates rose, and as advances in science and technology brought with them a constant stream of new (and sometimes more complex) terms and concepts, the practice of abbreviating terms became increasingly convenient. The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (''OED'') records the first printed use of the word ''initialism'' as occurring in 1899, but it did not come into general use until 1965, well after ''acronym'' had become common.

By 1943, the term ''acronym'' had been used in English to recognize abbreviations (and contractions of phrases) that were pronounced as words.&lt;ref name=Davenport&gt;B. Davenport ''American Notes and Queries'' (February 1943) vol 2 page 167 "Your correspondent who asks about words made up of the initial letters or syllables of other words may be interested in knowing that I have seen such words called by the name ''acronym'', which is useful and clear to anyone who knows a little Greek."&lt;/ref&gt; (It was formed from the Greek words {{lang|grc|ἄκρος}}, ''{{transl|grc|akros}}'', "topmost, extreme" and {{lang|grc|ὄνομα}}, ''{{transl|grc|onoma}}'', "name.") For example, the army offense of being ''absent without official leave'' was abbreviated to "[[Desertion|A.W.O.L.]]" in reports, but when pronounced as a word (''awol''), it became an acronym.&lt;ref&gt;S. V. Baum (1962) ''American Speech'' Vol. 37 No. 1, The Acronym, Pure and Impure&lt;/ref&gt; While initial letters are commonly used to form an acronym, the original definition was "a word made from the initial letters or syllables of other words",&lt;ref&gt;''American Speech'' (1943) Vol. 18, No. 2, page 142&lt;/ref&gt; for example [[UNIVAC I|UNIVAC]] from UNIVersal Automatic Computer.&lt;ref&gt;''American Speech'' (1950) Vol. 25 No. 2 page 147&lt;/ref&gt;

In English, acronyms ''pronounced as words'' may be a 20th-century phenomenon. Linguist David Wilton in ''Word Myths: Debunking Linguistic Urban Legends'' claims that "forming words from acronyms is a distinctly twentieth- (and now twenty-first-) century phenomenon. There is only one known pre-twentieth-century [English] word with an acronymic origin and it was in vogue for only a short time in 1886. The word is ''colinderies'' or ''colinda'', an acronym for the [[Colonial and Indian Exposition]] held in London in that year."&lt;ref name="Wilton"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=cp0r3aa8EM8C&amp;dq=Word+Myths:+Debunking+Linguistic+Urban+Legends&amp;pg=PP1#PPA79,M1 |title=Word myths: debunking linguistic urban legends|publisher=|date= |author=Wilton, David|accessdate=September 16, 2010|isbn=978-0-19-517284-3|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/language/acronyms/acronyms.asp |title=Urban Legends Reference Pages: Language (Acronyms) |publisher=Snopes.com |date= |accessdate=September 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, although acronymic words seem not to have been ''employed in general vocabulary'' before the 20th century (as Wilton points out), the ''concept of their formation'' is treated as effortlessly understood (and evidently not novel) in a Poe story of the 1830s, "[[How to Write a Blackwood Article]]", which includes the contrived acronym P.R.E.T.T.Y.B.L.U.E.B.A.T.C.H.

===Early examples in English===
The use of Latin and Neo-Latin terms in [[vernacular]]s has been pan-European and predates modern English. Some examples of acronyms in this class are:

*''[[12-hour clock|A.M.]]'' (from Latin ''{{lang|la|ante meridiem}}'', "before noon") and ''[[12-hour clock|P.M.]]'' (from Latin ''{{lang|la|post meridiem}}'', "after noon")
*''A.D.'' (from Latin ''{{lang|la|[[Anno Domini]]}}'', "in the year of our Lord"), whose complement in English, ''B.C.'' &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Before Christ]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, is English-sourced
*''[[Okay|O.K.]]'', a term of disputed origin, dating back at least to the early 19th century, now used around the world

The earliest example of a word derived from an acronym listed by the [[Oxford English Dictionary|''OED'']] is "abjud" (now "[[abjad]]"), formed from the original first four letters of the [[Arabic alphabet]] in the late 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution=abjad, ''n.'' |contribution-url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/271930 |title=Oxford English Dictionary }}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some [[acrostics]] predate this, however, such as the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] witticism arranging the names of some members of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]'s Committee for Foreign Affairs to produce the [[Cabal ministry|"CABAL" ministry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution=cabal, ''n.'' |contribution-url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/25693 |title=Oxford English Dictionary }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current use===
Acronyms are used most often to abbreviate names of organizations and long or frequently referenced terms. The [[Military|armed forces]] and government agencies frequently employ acronyms; some well-known examples from the United States are among the "[[alphabet agencies]]" (also jokingly referred to as "[[alphabet soup (linguistics)|alphabet soup]]") created by [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] (also of course known as FDR) under the [[New Deal]]. Business and industry also are prolific coiners of acronyms. The rapid advance of science and technology in recent centuries seems to be an underlying force driving the usage, as new inventions and concepts with multiword names create a demand for shorter, more manageable names.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} One representative example, from the U.S. Navy, is COMCRUDESPAC, which stands for ''commander, cruisers destroyers Pacific''; it's also seen as "ComCruDesPac". "YABA-compatible" (where YABA stands for "yet another bloody acronym") is used to mean that a term's acronym can be pronounced but is not an offensive word, e.g., "When choosing a new name, be sure it is 'YABA-compatible'."&lt;ref&gt;K. D. Nilsen &amp; A. P. Nilsen (1995) ''The English Journal'' Vol. 84, No. 6.,"Literary Metaphors and Other Linguistic Innovations in Computer Language"&lt;/ref&gt;

Acronym use has been further popularized by text messaging on mobile phones with Short Message Systems (SMS). To fit messages into the 160-character SMS limit, acronyms such as "GF" (girlfriend), "LOL" (laughing out loud), and "DL" (download or down low) have become popular.&lt;ref&gt;Crystal, David. [[Txtng: the Gr8 Db8|Txtng: The Gr8 Db8]]. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008. {{ISBN|978-0-19-954490-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Linguistic prescription|prescriptivist]]s disdain texting acronyms and abbreviations as decreasing clarity, or as failure to use "pure" or "proper" English.  Others point out that [[language change]] has happened for thousands of years, and argue that it should be embraced as inevitable, or as innovation that adapts the language to changing circumstances. In this view, the modern practice is just as legitimate as those in "proper" English of the current generation of speakers, such as the abbreviation of corporation names in places with limited writing space (e.g., ticker tape, newspaper [[column inch]]es).

====Aids to learning the expansion without leaving a document====
{{refimprove section|date=January 2015}}
In formal writing for a broad audience, the expansion is typically given at the first occurrence of the acronym within a given text, for the benefit of those readers who do not know what it stands for. The capitalization of the original term is independent of it being acronymized, being lowercase for a [[common noun]] such as frequently asked questions (FAQ) but uppercase for a [[proper noun]] such as the United Nations (UN) (as explained at [[#Casing of expansions|Case &gt; Casing of expansions]]).

In addition to expansion at first use, some publications also have a key listing all acronyms used therein and what their expansions are. This is a convenience to readers for two reasons. The first is that if they are not reading the entire publication sequentially (which is a common mode of reading), then they may encounter an acronym without having seen its expansion. Having a key at the start or end of the publication obviates skimming over the text searching for an earlier use to find the expansion. (This is especially important in the print medium, where no search utility is available.) The second reason for the key feature is its pedagogical value in educational works such as textbooks. It gives students a way to review the meanings of the acronyms introduced in a chapter after they have done the line-by-line reading, and also a way to quiz themselves on the meanings (by covering up the expansion column and recalling the expansions from memory, then checking their answers by uncovering). In addition, this feature enables readers possessing knowledge of the abbreviations not to have to encounter expansions (redundant to such readers).

Expansion at first use and the abbreviation-key feature are aids to the reader that originated in the print era, and they are equally useful in print and online. In addition, the online medium offers yet more aids, such as [[tooltip]]s, [[hyperlink]]s, and rapid search via [[search engine technology]].

====Jargon====
Acronyms often occur in [[jargon]]. An acronym may have different meanings in different areas of industry, writing, and scholarship. The general reason for this is convenience and succinctness for specialists, although it has led some to obfuscate the meaning either intentionally, to deter those without such domain-specific knowledge, or unintentionally, by creating an acronym that already existed.

The medical literature has been struggling to control the proliferation of acronyms as their use has evolved from aiding communication to hindering it. This has become such a problem that it is even evaluated at the level of medical academies such as the American Academy of Dermatology.
&lt;ref name="PMID19150279"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Patel CB, Rashid RM |title=Averting the proliferation of acronymophilia in dermatology: effectively avoiding ADCOMSUBORDCOMPHIBSPAC |journal=J Am Acad Dermatol |volume=60 |issue=2 |pages=340–4 |date=February 2009 |pmid=19150279 |doi=10.1016/j.jaad.2008.10.035 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====As mnemonics====
Acronyms are often taught as [[mnemonic]] devices, for example in physics the colors of the visible spectrum are [[ROY G. BIV]] (red-orange-yellow-green-blue-indigo-violet). They are also used as mental checklists, for example in aviation: [[GUMPS]], which is Gas-Undercarriage-Mixture-Propeller-Seatbelts. Other examples of mnemonic acronyms include [[CAN SLIM]], and [[PAVPANIC]] as well as [[PEMDAS]].

====Acronyms as legendary etymology====
{{See also|Backronym}}

It is not uncommon for acronyms to be cited in a kind of [[false etymology]], called a ''folk etymology'', for a word. Such etymologies persist in popular culture but have no factual basis in [[historical linguistics]], and are examples of language-related [[urban legend]]s. For example, ''[[police officer|cop]]'' is commonly cited as being derived, it is presumed, from "constable on patrol,"&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.snopes.com/language/acronyms/cop.asp Snopes article].&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Posh (nautical term)|posh]]'' from "[[Port Outward, Starboard Home|port out, starboard home]]".&lt;ref name="posh"&gt;
{{Cite book|title=Port Out, Starboard Home: And Other Language Myths|publisher=Penguin Books|last=Quinion|first=Michael|isbn=0-14-101223-4|year=2005}}; published in the US as
{{Cite book|title=Ballyhoo, Buckaroo, and Spuds|last=Quinion|first=Michael|year=2006|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=0-06-085153-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; With some of these specious expansions, the "belief" that the etymology is acronymic has clearly been [[tongue-in-cheek]] among many citers, as with "gentlemen only, ladies forbidden" for ''[[golf]]'', although many other (more [[wikt:credulous|credulous]]) people have uncritically taken it for fact.&lt;ref name="posh"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/language/acronyms/golf.asp |title=See article at Snopes |publisher=Snopes.com |date= |accessdate=September 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Taboo word]]s in particular commonly have such false etymologies: ''[[shit]]'' from "ship/store high in transit"&lt;ref name="Wilton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="etymonline.com2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/baloney.php |title=Etymonline.com |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=September 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "special high-intensity training" and ''[[fuck]]'' from "for unlawful carnal knowledge", or "fornication under consent/command of the king".&lt;ref name="etymonline.com2"/&gt;

==Orthographic styling==

===Punctuation===

====Showing the ellipsis of letters====
In English, abbreviations have traditionally been written with a [[full stop|full stop/period/point]] in place of the deleted part to show the ellipsis of letters—although the [[Colon (punctuation)|colon]] and [[apostrophe]] have also had this role—and with a space after full stops (e.g. "A.&amp;nbsp;D."). In the case of most acronyms, each letter is an abbreviation of a separate word and, in theory, should get its own termination mark. Such punctuation is diminishing with the belief that the presence of all-capital letters is sufficient to indicate that the word is an abbreviation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]]: ''initialism''. " Globe &amp; Mail (Toronto)  22 May 10/4   Americanization has also largely done away with periods in acronyms and initialisms."&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Ellipsis-is-understood style=====
Some influential [[style guide]]s, such as that of the [[BBC]], no longer require punctuation to show ellipsis; some even proscribe it. Larry Trask, American author of ''The [[Penguin Books|Penguin]] Guide to Punctuation'', states categorically that, in [[British English]], "this tiresome and unnecessary practice is now obsolete".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informatics.susx.ac.uk/doc/punctuation/node28.html |title=Abbreviations |publisher=Informatics.susx.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=September 16, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070410113359/http://www.informatics.susx.ac.uk/doc/punctuation/node28.html| archivedate=April 10, 2007| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Pronunciation-dependent style and periods=====
Nevertheless, some influential [[style guide]]s, many of them [[American English|American]], still require periods in certain instances. For example, [[The New York Times Manual of Style and Usage|The New York Times' guide]] recommends following each segment with a period when the letters are pronounced individually, as in ''[[KGB|K.G.B.]]'', but not when pronounced as a word, as in ''[[NATO]]''.&lt;ref name = "NY Times"&gt;
{{Cite news

|title=Secret Obsessions at the Top
|first=Nicholas D.
|last=Kristoff
|work=The New York Times
|date=February 7, 2004
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The logic of this style is that the pronunciation is reflected graphically by the punctuation scheme.

=====Other conventions=====
When a multiple-letter abbreviation is formed from a single word, periods are in general not used, although they may be common in informal usage. ''TV'', for example, may stand for a ''single'' word (''television'' or ''transvestite'', for instance), and is in general spelled without punctuation (except in the plural). Although ''PS'' stands for the single word ''postscript'' (or the Latin ''postscriptum''), it is often spelled with periods (''P.S.'').

The [[Slash (punctuation)|slash]] ('/', or ''solidus'') is sometimes used to separate the letters in a two-letter acronym, as in ''N/A'' (''not applicable, not available''), ''c/o'' (''care of'') and ''w/o'' (''without'').

Inconveniently long words used frequently in related contexts can be represented according to their letter count. For example, ''i18n'' abbreviates ''[[internationalization]]'', a computer-science term for adapting software for worldwide use. The ''18'' represents the 18 letters that come between the first and the last in ''internationalization''. ''Localization'' can be abbreviated ''l10n'', ''[[multilingualization]]'' ''m17n'', and ''[[accessibility]]'' ''a11y''. In addition to the use of a specific number replacing that many letters, the more general "x" can be used to replace an unspecified number of letters. Examples include ''Crxn'' for ''crystallization'' and the series familiar to physicians for [[medical history|history]], [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]], and [[therapy|treatment]] (''hx'', ''dx'', ''tx'').

====Representing plurals and possessives====

There is a question about how to pluralize acronyms. Often a writer will add an 's' following an apostrophe, as in "PC's". However, [[Kate Turabian]], writing about style in academic writings,&lt;ref name="Chicago"&gt;Turabian, K., ''A Manual for Writers of Research Papers, Theses, and Dissertations'', 7th Edition, subsection 20.1.2&lt;/ref&gt; allows for an apostrophe to form plural acronyms "only when an abbreviation contains internal periods or both capital and lowercase letters". Turabian would therefore prefer "DVDs" and "URLs" and "Ph.D.'s". The [[Modern Language Association]]&lt;ref name="MLA"&gt;Modern Language Association (MLA) Handbook for Writers of Research Papers, 7th Edition 2009, subsection 3.2.7.g&lt;/ref&gt; and [[American Psychological Association]]&lt;ref name="APA"&gt;Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association (APA), 5th Edition 2001, subsection 3.28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association (APA), 6th Edition 2010, subsection 4.29&lt;/ref&gt; prohibit apostrophes from being used to pluralize acronyms regardless of periods (so "compact discs" would be "CDs" or "C.D.s"), whereas ''[[The New York Times]]'' style guide requires an apostrophe when pluralizing all abbreviations regardless of periods (preferring "PC's, TV's and VCR's").&lt;ref&gt;Siegal, AM., Connolly, WG., [https://books.google.com/books?ei=-y5aVHCTyLAEl5GB0AE&amp;id=RT5w0s7_op8C&amp;dq=new+york+times+style&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=plurals+abbreviations ''The New York Times Manual of Style and Usage''], Three Rivers Press, 1999, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Possessive plurals that also include apostrophes for mere pluralization and periods appear especially complex: for example, ''the C.D.'s' labels'' (the labels of the compact discs). In some instances, however, an apostrophe may increase clarity: for example, if the final letter of an abbreviation is ''S'', as in ''SOS's'' (although abbreviations ending with S can also take ''-es'', e.g. ''SOSes''), or when pluralizing an abbreviation that has periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.writersblock.ca/tips/monthtip/tipmar96.htm |title=Writer's Block&amp;nbsp;– Writing Tips&amp;nbsp;– Plural and Possessive Abbreviations |publisher=Writersblock.ca |date= |accessdate=September 16, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100726124408/http://www.writersblock.ca/tips/monthtip/tipmar96.htm |archivedate=July 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Robert |url=http://www.editfast.com/english/grammar/apostrophes/apostrophe_plurals.htm |title=EditFast Grammar Resource: Apostrophes: Forming Plurals |publisher=Editfast.com |date= |accessdate=September 16, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101027001351/http://editfast.com/english/grammar/apostrophes/apostrophe_plurals.htm |archivedate=October 27, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A particularly rich source of options arises when the plural of an acronym would normally be indicated in a word other than the final word if spelled out in full. A classic example is ''Member of Parliament'', which in plural is ''Members of Parliament''. It is possible then to abbreviate this as ''M's P.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nla.gov.au/anbd.bib-an41354070 |title=Libraries Australia&amp;nbsp;– T.H.

The argument that acronyms should have no different plural form (for example, "If ''D'' can stand for ''disc'', it can also stand for ''disc'''s'''''") is in general disregarded because of the practicality in distinguishing singulars and plurals. This is not the case, however, when the abbreviation is understood to describe a plural noun already: For example, ''U.S.'' is short for ''United State'''s''''', but not ''United State''. In this case, the options for making a possessive form of an abbreviation that is already in its plural form without a final ''s'' may seem awkward: for example, ''U.S.'', ''U.S.'s'', etc. In such instances, possessive abbreviations are often forgone in favor of simple [[adjective|attributive]] usage (for example, ''the '''U.S.''' economy'') or expanding the abbreviation to its full form and ''then'' making the possessive (for example, ''the '''United States'''' economy''). On the other hand, in speech, the pronunciation ''United States's'' sometimes is used.

Abbreviations that come from single, rather than multiple, words—such as ''TV'' (''television'')—are usually pluralized without apostrophes (''two TVs''); most writers feel that the apostrophe should be reserved for the possessive (''the TV's antenna'').

{{anchor|pp|PP|pP|Pp|page|pages}} In some languages, the convention of doubling the letters in the acronym is used to indicate plural words: for example, the Spanish ''{{lang|es|EE. UU.}}'', for ''{{lang|es|Estados Unidos}}'' ('United States'). This old convention is still followed for a limited number of English abbreviations, such as ''SS.'' for "Saints", ''pp.'' for the Latin plural of "pages", ''{{lang|la|paginae}}'', or ''MSS'' for "manuscripts". In the case of ''pp.'' it derives from the original Latin phrase per procurationem meaning 'through the agency of';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=pp Definition|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/pp|website=en.oxforddictionaries.com|publisher=Oxford University|accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; an English translation alternative is ''particular pages'' in a book or document: see pp. 8–88.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org|website=dictionary.cambridge.org|title=Cambridge Dictionary - English Dictionary, Translations &amp; Thesaurus|publisher=Cambridge University|accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Case===

====All-caps style====
The most common [[capitalization]] scheme seen with acronyms is all-uppercase ([[All caps|all-caps]]), except for those few that have linguistically taken on an identity as regular words, with the acronymous etymology of the words fading into the background of common knowledge, such as has occurred with the words ''[[scuba set|scuba]]'', ''[[laser]]'', and ''[[radar]]''—these are known as ''anacronyms''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ShorterOxfordEnglishDictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anacronyms (note well ''-acro-'') should not be [[homophone|homophonously]] confused with [[misnomer#Anachronym|anachronyms (note well ''-chron-''), which are a type of misnomer]].

=====Small-caps variant=====
[[Small caps]] are sometimes used to make the run of capital letters seem less jarring to the reader. For example, the style of some American publications, including the ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'' and ''[[USA Today]]'', is to use small caps for acronyms longer than three letters{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}; thus "U.S." and "[[Franklin D. Roosevelt|FDR]]" in normal caps, but "{{smallcaps|nato}}" in small caps. The acronyms "[[Anno Domini|AD]]" and "[[Before Christ|BC]]" are often smallcapped as well, as in: "From {{nowrap|4004 {{smallcaps|bc}} to {{smallcaps|ad}} 525}}".

=====Mixed-case variant=====
Words derived from an acronym by affixing are typically expressed in mixed case, so the root acronym is clear. For example, ''pre-WWII politics'', ''post-NATO world'', ''[[DNAase]]''. In some cases a derived acronym may also be expressed in mixed case. For example, [[messenger RNA]] and [[transfer RNA]] become mRNA and tRNA.

====Pronunciation-dependent style and case====
Some publications choose to capitalize only the first letter of acronyms, reserving all-caps styling for initialisms, writing the pronounced acronyms "Nato" and "Aids" in mixed case, but the initialisms "USA" and "FBI" in all caps. For example, this is the style used in ''[[The Guardian]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/styleguide |title=Styleguide |publisher=Guardian.co.uk | location=London | date=December 19, 2008 |quote=Use all capitals if an abbreviation is pronounced as the individual letters (an initialism): BBC, CEO, US, VAT, etc; if it is an acronym (pronounced as a word) spell out with initial capital, eg Nasa, Nato, Unicef, unless it can be considered to have entered the language as an everyday word, such as [[AWOL|awol]], [[laser]] and, more recently, [[asbo]], [[pin number]] and [[sim card]]. Note that [[pdf]] and [[public limited company|plc]] are lowercase.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[BBC News]] typically edits to this style (though its official style guide, dating from 2003, still recommends all-caps&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bbctraining.com/pdfs/newsstyleguide.pdf |title=BBC News Style Guide |publisher=bbc.co.uk |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707214856/http://www.bbctraining.com/pdfs/newsStyleGuide.pdf |archivedate=July 7, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;). The logic of this style is that the pronunciation is reflected graphically by the capitalization scheme.

Some style manuals also base the letters' [[Letter case|case]] on their number. ''The New York Times'', for example, keeps ''NATO'' in all capitals (while several guides in the British press may render it ''Nato''), but uses lower case in ''[[United Nations Children's Fund|UNICEF]]'' (from "United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund") because it is more than four letters, and to style it in caps might look ungainly (flirting with the appearance of "shouting capitals").

===Numerals and constituent words===
While abbreviations typically exclude the initials of short [[function word]]s (such as "and", "or", "of", or "to"), this is not always the case. (A similar set of words is sometimes left as lowercase in [[Letter case#Headings and publication titles|headers and publication titles]].) Sometimes function words are included to make a pronounceable acronym, such as CORE ([[Congress of Racial Equality]]). Sometimes the letters representing these words are written in lower case, such as in the cases of TfL ([[Transport for London]]) and ''LotR'' (''[[Lord of the Rings]]''); this usually occurs when the acronym represents a multi-word proper noun.

Numbers (both [[Cardinal number|cardinal]] and [[Ordinal number|ordinal]]) in names are often represented by [[numerical digit|digit]]s rather than initial letters: as in ''4GL'' ([[Fourth generation language]]) or ''G77'' ([[Group of 77]]). Large numbers may use [[SI prefix#Use outside SI|metric prefixes]], as with ''[[Y2K]]'' for "Year 2000" (sometimes written ''Y2k'', because the SI symbol for 1000 is ''k''—not ''K'', which stands for ''[[kelvin]]''). Exceptions using initials for numbers include ''[[three letter acronym|TLA]]'' (three-letter acronym/abbreviation) and ''GoF'' ([[Gang of Four (software)|Gang of Four]]). Abbreviations using numbers for other purposes include repetitions, such as ''[[W3C]]'' ("World Wide Web Consortium") and ''[[WVOX#Notable Past Programming|T3]]'' (''Trends, Tips &amp; Tools for Everyday Living''); pronunciation, such as ''[[Business-to-business|B2B]]'' ("business to business"); and [[numeronym]]s, such as ''i18n'' ("internationalization"; ''18'' represents the 18 letters between the initial ''i'' and the final ''n'').

===Casing of expansions===
Although many authors of [[expository writing]] show a predisposition to capitalizing the initials of the expansion for pedagogical emphasis (trying to thrust the reader's attention toward where the letters are coming from), this sometimes conflicts with the convention of [[English orthography]], which reserves capitals in the middle of sentences for [[proper noun]]s. Enforcing the general convention, most professional editors{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}&lt;!-- the only citation is to the AMA Manual of Style; what do other style guides say? --&gt; [[Case folding|case-fold]] such expansions to their standard orthography when editing manuscripts for publication. The justification is that (1) readers are smart enough to figure out where the letters came from, even without their being capitalized for emphasis, and that (2) common nouns do not take capital initials in standard English orthography.  Such house styles also usually disfavor bold or italic font for the initial letters.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} For example,
"the onset of Congestive Heart Failure (CHF)" or "the onset of '''c'''ongestive '''h'''eart '''f'''ailure (CHF)" if found in an unpublished manuscript would be rewritten as "the onset of congestive heart failure (CHF)" in the final published article when following the [[AMA Manual of Style]].&lt;ref name="AMA10p442"&gt;{{Citation |last=Iverson |first=Cheryl, et al. (eds) |title=AMA Manual of Style |edition=10th |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford, Oxfordshire |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-19-517633-9 |page=442 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Changes to (or word play on) the expanded meaning==
===Pseudo-acronyms=== &lt;!-- [[Pseudo-acronym]] and [[Orphan initialism]] are redirects to this section --&gt;
Some apparent acronyms or other abbreviations do not stand for anything and cannot be expanded to some meaning. Such '''pseudo-acronyms''' may be pronunciation-based, such as [[BBQ]] (bee-bee-cue), for "barbecue", or [[K9 (disambiguation)|K9]] (kay-nine) for "canine". Pseudo-acronyms also frequently develop as "'''orphan initialisms'''"; an existing acronym is redefined as a non-acronymous name, severing its link to its previous meaning.&lt;ref name=upenn&gt;{{cite web|url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/003555.html|title=Language Log: Orphan initialisms|website=itre.cis.upenn.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=about&gt;[http://grammar.about.com/b/2010/06/02/what-does-bp-stand-for.htm What Does "BP" Stand For?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121118220424/http://grammar.about.com/b/2010/06/02/what-does-bp-stand-for.htm |date=November 18, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the letters of the [[SAT]], a US college entrance test originally dubbed "Scholastic Aptitude Test", no longer officially stand for anything.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/02/us/insisting-it-s-nothing-creator-says-sat-not-sat.html  |title=Insisting It's Nothing, Creator Says SAT, Not S.A.T. |newspaper=The New York Times |date=April 2, 1997 |last=Applebome |first=Peter }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= Changes to SAT Make Test More Coachable |last=Komarek |first=Dan |newspaper=Daily Californian| date=July 29, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is common with companies that want to retain [[brand recognition]] while moving away from an outdated image: American Telephone and Telegraph became [[AT&amp;T Corporation|AT&amp;T]],&lt;ref name=upenn /&gt; [[Kentucky Fried Chicken]] became [[KFC]] to de-emphasize the role of frying in the preparation of its signature dishes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3190/is_n8_v25/ai_10403447 |title=KFC shuns 'fried' image with new name&amp;nbsp;– Kentucky Fried Chicken has changed its name to KFC |author=Peter O. Keegan |publisher=Nation's Restaurant News |date=February 21, 1991 |accessdate=August 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|This change was also applied to other languages, with ''Poulet Frit Kentucky'' becoming ''PFK'' in French Canada.}} and [[BP|British Petroleum]] became BP.&lt;ref name=about /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corporatewatch.org/?lid=287|title=BP plc History|accessdate=September 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Russia Today]] has rebranded itself as [[RT (TV network)|RT]]. Genzyme Transgenics Corporation became GTC Biotherapeutics, Inc. in order to reduce perceived corporate risk of sabotage/vandalism by Luddite activists.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Pseudo-acronyms may have advantages in international markets:{{according to whom|date=October 2017}} for example, some national [[Affiliate (commerce)|affiliate]]s of [[International Business Machines]] are legally incorporated as "IBM" (for example, "IBM Canada") to avoid translating the full name into local languages.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} Likewise, "[[UBS AG|UBS]]" is the name of the merged [[Union Bank of Switzerland]] and [[Swiss Bank Corporation]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/2833426/UBS-means-RIP-for-Warburg.html UBS means RIP for Warburg]. ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', November 13, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; and  "[[HSBC]]" has replaced "The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation." Sometimes,{{when|date=October 2017}} companies whose original name gives a clear indication of their place of origin will use acronyms when expanding to foreign markets—for example, [[Toronto-Dominion Bank]] continues to operate under the full name in Canada, but its U.S. subsidiary is known as [[TD Canada Trust|TD Bank]],{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} just as [[Royal Bank of Canada]] used its full name in Canada (a [[constitutional monarchy]]), but its now-defunct U.S. subsidiary was called [[RBC Bank]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

===Redundant acronyms and RAS syndrome===
{{Main|RAS syndrome}}
Rebranding can lead to [[RAS syndrome|redundant acronym syndrome]],{{Original research inline|date=October 2017}} as when [[Trustee Savings Bank]] became TSB Bank,{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} or when [[Railway Express Agency]] became REA Express.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} A few{{vague|date=October 2017}} [[high-tech]] companies have taken the redundant acronym to the extreme{{according to whom|date=October 2017}}: for example, ISM Information Systems Management Corp. and SHL Systemhouse Ltd.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} Examples in entertainment include the television shows ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]]'' and ''[[NCIS (TV series)|Navy: NCIS]]''{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} ("Navy" was dropped in the second season), where the redundancy was likely{{weasel inline|date=October 2017}} designed to educate new viewers as to what the initials stood for.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} The same reasoning{{according to whom|date=November 2017}} was in evidence when the [[Royal Bank of Canada]]'s Canadian operations rebranded to RBC Royal Bank,{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} or when [[Bank of Montreal]] rebranded their retail banking subsidiary BMO Bank of Montreal.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Another common example{{according to whom|date=October 2017}} is "[[Random-access memory|RAM]] memory", which is redundant because "RAM" ("random-access memory") includes the initial of the word "memory".{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} "PIN" stands for "personal identification number", obviating the second word in "[[PIN number]]"{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}; in this case its retention may be motivated to avoid ambiguity with the homophonous word "pin".{{Original research inline|date=October 2017}} Other examples include "[[Automated teller machine|ATM]] machine," "[[EAB bank]]," "[[Cable Ace|CableACE Award]]," "[[DC Comics]]," "[[HIV]] virus," Microsoft's NT Technology, and the formerly redundant "[[SAT]] test," now simply "SAT Reasoning Test").{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} [[Spike (TV network)|TNN]] (The Nashville/National Network) also renamed itself "The New TNN" for a brief interlude.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

===Simple redefining===
Sometimes, the initials continue to stand for an expanded meaning, but the original meaning is simply replaced. Some examples:
*[[DVD]] was originally an acronym of the unofficial term ''digital video disc'', but is now stated by the [[DVD Forum]] as standing for ''Digital Versatile Disc''.
*[[GAO]] changed the full form of its name from ''General Accounting Office'' to ''Government Accountability Office''.
*[[United States Government Publishing Office|GPO]] (in the United States) changed the full form of its name from ''Government Printing Office'' to ''Government Publishing Office''.
*[[RAID]] used to mean ''Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks'', but is now commonly interpreted as ''Redundant Array of Independent Disks''.
*WWF originally stood for ''World Wildlife Fund'', but now stands for ''[[Worldwide Fund for Nature]]'' (although the former name is still used in Canada and the United States).
*The [[Union for International Cancer Control|UICC]], whose initials came from the [[Romance languages|Romance-language]] versions of its name (such as French ''{{lang|fr|Union Internationale Contre le Cancer}}'', "International Union Against Cancer"), changed the English expansion of its name to Union for International Cancer Control (from International Union Against Cancer) so that the English expansion, too, would correspond to the UICC initials.

===Backronyms===
{{Main|Backronym}}

A ''backronym'' (or ''bacronym'') is a [[phrase]] that is constructed "after the fact" from a previously existing word. For example, the novelist and critic [[Anthony Burgess]] once proposed that the word "book" ought to stand for "'''B'''ox '''O'''f '''O'''rganized '''K'''nowledge."&lt;ref&gt;''99 Novels: The Best in English Since 1939'' (New York: Summit Books, 1984).&lt;/ref&gt; A classic real-world example of this is the name of the predecessor to the Apple Macintosh, The [[Apple Lisa]], which was said to refer to "Local Integrated Software Architecture", but was actually named after Steve Jobs's daughter, born in 1978.

Backronyms are often times used to comedic effect. An example of creating a backronym for comedic effect would be in naming a group or organization, the name A.C.R.O.N.Y.M stands for (among other things) "A Clever Regiment Of Nerdy Young Men".

===Contrived acronyms===
Acronyms are sometimes [[wikt:contrive#Verb|contrived]], that is, deliberately designed to be especially apt for the thing being named (by having a dual meaning or by borrowing the positive connotations of an existing word). Some examples of contrived acronyms are ''[[USA PATRIOT Act|USA PATRIOT]]'', [[Can Spam Act|''CAN SPAM'']], ''[[CAPTCHA]]'' and ''[[AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power|ACT UP]]''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} The clothing company [[French Connection (clothing)|French Connection]] began referring to itself as ''fcuk'', standing for "French Connection United Kingdom." The company then created T-shirts and several advertising campaigns that exploit the acronym's similarity to the taboo word "[[fuck]]."

The US Department of Defense's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ([[DARPA]]) is known for developing contrived acronyms to name projects, including ''RESURRECT'', ''NIRVANA'', and ''DUDE''. In July 2010, [[Wired Magazine]] reported that DARPA announced programs to "..transform biology from a descriptive to a predictive field of science" named ''BATMAN'' and ''ROBIN'' for ''Biochronicity and Temporal Mechanisms Arising in Nature'' and ''Robustness of Biologically-Inspired Networks'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2010/07/holy-acronym-darpa-batman-robin-to-master-biology-outdo-evolution/| title= Holy Acronym, Darpa! 'Batman &amp; Robin' to Master Biology, Outdo Evolution | author= Katie Drummond | work=Wired| date=July 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; a reference to the [[Batman]] and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] comic-book superheroes.

The short-form names of [[clinical trial]]s and other scientific studies constitute a large class of acronyms that includes many contrived examples, as well as many with a partial rather than complete correspondence of letters to expansion components. These trials tend to have full names that are accurately descriptive of what the trial is about but are thus also too long to serve practically as [[name]]s within the syntax of a sentence, so a short name is also developed, which can serve as a syntactically useful handle and also provide at least a degree of [[mnemonic]] reminder as to the full name. Examples widely known in [[medicine]] include the ALLHAT trial (Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial) and the CHARM trial (Candesartan in Heart Failure: Assessment of Reduction in Mortality and Morbidity). The fact that [[RAS syndrome]] is often involved, as well as that the letters often don't entirely match, have sometimes been pointed out by annoyed researchers preoccupied by the idea that because the [[archetype|archetypal]] form of acronyms originated with one-to-one letter matching, there must be some moral impropriety in their ever deviating from that form. However, the [[wikt:raison d'être|raison d'être]] of clinical trial acronyms, as with [[gene nomenclature#Symbol and name|gene and protein symbols]], is simply to have a syntactically usable and [[recall (memory)|recallable]] short name to complement the long name that is often syntactically unusable and not [[memorization|memorized]]. It is useful for the short name to give a reminder of the long name, which supports the reasonable censure of "cutesy" examples that provide little to no hint of it. But beyond that reasonably close correspondence, the short name's chief utility is in functioning cognitively as a [[name]], rather than being a [[wikt:cryptic#Adjective|cryptic]] and forgettable string, albeit faithful to the matching of letters. However, other reasonable critiques have been (1) that it is irresponsible to mention trial acronyms without explaining them at least once by providing the long names somewhere in the document,&lt;ref name="PMID-12767559"&gt;{{Citation |last=Cheng |first=Tsung O |year=2003 |title=No more unexplained trial acronyms please. Trial Acronyms: Better Obvious than Obscure (TABOO) |journal=Int J Cardiol |volume=89 |issue=2-3 |pages=303 |pmid=12767559 |doi=10.1016/S0167-5273(02)00411-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and (2) that the proliferation of trial acronyms has resulted in ambiguity, such as 3 different trials all called ASPECT, which is another reason why failing to explain them somewhere in the document is irresponsible in scientific communication.&lt;ref name="PMID-12767559"/&gt; At least one study has evaluated the [[citation impact]] and other traits of acronym-named trials compared with others,&lt;ref name="PMID-16823008"&gt;{{Citation |last=Stanbrook |first=MB |last2=Austin |first2=PC |last3=Redelmeier |first3=DA |year=2006 |title=Acronym-named randomized trials in medicine—the ART in medicine study |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=355 |issue=1 |pages=101–102 |pmid=16823008 |doi=10.1056/NEJMc053420 }}&lt;/ref&gt; finding both good aspects (mnemonic help, name recall) and potential flaws ([[connotation|connotatively]] driven [[bias]]).&lt;ref name="PMID-16823008"/&gt;

Some acronyms are chosen deliberately to avoid a name considered undesirable: For example, ''[[Verliebt in Berlin]]'' (ViB), a German [[telenovela]], was first intended to be ''Alles nur aus Liebe (All for Love)'', but was changed to avoid the resultant acronym ''[[anal sex|ANAL]]''. Likewise, the Computer Literacy and Internet Technology qualification is known as ''CLaIT'',&lt;ref name="CIE.org.uk_CLaIT"&gt;{{Citation|author=University of Cambridge International Examinations team |title=University of Cambridge International Examinations &gt; CLAiT–International page |url=http://www.cie.org.uk/qualifications/vocational/clait/overview |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114062047/http://www.cie.org.uk/qualifications/vocational/clait/overview |archivedate=January 14, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than ''[[clitoris|CLIT]]''. In Canada, the [[Canadian Alliance|Canadian Conservative Reform Alliance (Party)]] was quickly renamed to the Canadian Reform Conservative Alliance when its opponents pointed out that its initials spelled CCRAP (pronounced "see [[feces|crap]]"). (The satirical magazine ''[[Frank (magazine)|Frank]]'' had proposed alternatives to CCRAP, namely SSHIT and [[Nazi Party|NSDAP]].) Two Irish Institutes of Technology (Galway and Tralee) chose different acronyms from other institutes when they were upgraded from Regional Technical colleges. Tralee RTC became the Institute of Technology Tralee (ITT), as opposed to Tralee Institute of Technology ([[breast|TIT]]). Galway RTC became Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology (GMIT), as opposed to Galway Institute of Technology ([[wikt:git|GIT]]). The charity sports organization [[Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society#Fundraising|Team in Training]] is known as "TNT" and not "TIT". [[Technological Institute of Textile &amp; Sciences]] is still known as TITS. [[George Mason University]] was planning to name their law school the Antonin Scalia School of Law ([[asshole|ASSOL]]) in honor of the late [[Antonin Scalia]], only to change it to the Antonin Scalia Law School later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.npr.org/2016/04/07/473339332/unfortunate-acronym-forces-law-school-name-change| title= Unfortunate Acronym Forces Law School Name Change | author= Morning Edition | work=NPR| date=April 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Macronyms/nested acronyms===
A '''macronym''', or '''nested acronym''', is an acronym in which one or more letters stand for acronyms themselves. The word "macronym" is a [[portmanteau]] of "[[wikt:macro-|macro-]]" and "acronym".

Some examples of macronyms are: &lt;!-- with citations in each individual article's references --&gt;
* [[XHR]] stands for "XML HTTP Request", in which [[XML]] is "eXtensible Markup Language", and [[HTTP]] stands for "HyperText Transfer Protocol".
* [[IBM POWER microprocessors|POWER]] stands for ''Performance Optimization With Enhanced RISC'', in which [[RISC]] stands for ''Reduced Instruction Set Computing''.
* [[VHDL]] stands for "VHSIC Hardware Description Language", in which [[VHSIC]] stands for "Very High Speed Integrated Circuit".
* [[XSD]] stands for "XML Schema Definition", in which [[XML]] stands for "eXtensible Markup Language".
* [[SECS]] stands for "SEMI equipment communication standard", in which [[SEMI]] stands for "Semiconductor equipment manufacturing industries".
* [[AOL Instant Messenger|AIM]] stands for "AOL Instant Messenger", in which [[AOL]] stands for "[[America Online]]".
* [[Houston Automatic Spooling Priority|HASP]] stood for Houston Automatic Spooling Priority, but [[spooling]] itself was an acronym&amp;nbsp;– simultaneous peripheral operations on-line

Some macronyms can be multiply nested: the second-order acronym points to another one further down a hierarchy. In an informal competition run by the magazine ''[[New Scientist]]'', a fully documented specimen was discovered that may be the most deeply nested of all: RARS is the "Regional ATOVS Retransmission Service"; ATOVS is "Advanced TOVS"; TOVS is "[[TIROS]] operational vertical sounder"; and TIROS is "Television infrared observational satellite".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20727681.100-very-deep-multiply-nested-acronyms.html |title=Very deep multiply nested acronyms |publisher=Newscientist.com |date=July 7, 2010 |accessdate=September 16, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100914033751/http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20727681.100-very-deep-multiply-nested-acronyms.html| archivedate= September 14, 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fully expanded, "RARS" might thus become "Regional Advanced Television Infrared Observational Satellite Operational Vertical Sounder Retransmission Service". However, to say that "RARS" stands directly for that string of words, or can be interchanged with it in [[syntax]] (in the same way that "CHF" can be usefully interchanged with "congestive heart failure"), is a [[linguistic prescription|prescriptive]] misapprehension rather than a linguistically accurate description; the true nature of such a term is closer to [[#All-caps style|anacronymic]] than to being interchangeable like simpler acronyms are. The latter are fully reducible in an attempt to "spell everything out and avoid all abbreviations," but the former are irreducible in that respect; they can be [[gloss (annotation)|annotated]] with parenthetical explanations, but they cannot be eliminated from speech or writing in any useful or practical way. Just as the words ''laser'' and ''radar'' function as words in [[syntax]] and [[cognition]] without a need to focus on their acronymic origins, terms such as "RARS" and "[[CHA2DS2–VASc score]]" are irreducible in [[natural language]]; if they are purged, the form of language that is left may conform to some imposed rule, but it cannot be described as remaining natural. Similarly, [[protein]] and [[gene]] nomenclature, [[gene nomenclature#Symbol and name|which uses symbols extensively]], includes such terms as the name of the [[NACHT domain|NACHT protein domain]], which reflects the symbols of some proteins that contain the domain—NAIP (NLR family apoptosis inhibitor protein), C2TA (major histocompatibility complex class II transcription activator), HET-E (incompatibility locus protein from ''Podospora anserine''), and TP1 (telomerase-associated protein)—but is not syntactically reducible to them. The name is thus itself more symbol than acronym, and its expansion cannot replace it while preserving its function in natural syntax as a [[name]] within a [[clause]] clearly [[parsing|parsable]] by human readers or listeners.

====Recursive acronyms====
{{Main|Recursive acronym}}
A special type of macronym, the [[recursive acronym]], has letters whose expansion refers back to the macronym itself. One of the earliest examples appears in ''[[The Hacker's Dictionary]]'' as [[Mung (computer term)|MUNG]], which stands for "MUNG Until No Good".

Some examples of recursive acronyms are:
* [[GNU]] stands for "GNU's Not Unix"
* [[LAME]] stands for "LAME Ain't an MP3 Encoder"
* [[PHP]] stands for "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor"
* [[Wine (software)|WINE]] stands for "WINE Is Not an Emulator"
* [[GNU Hurd|HURD]] stands for "HIRD of Unix-replacing daemons", where HIRD itself stands for "HURD of interfaces representing depth" (a "mutually recursive" acronym)

==Non-English languages==

===Specific languages===

====Chinese====
In English language discussions of languages with [[syllabary|syllabic]] or [[logographic]] writing systems (such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean), "acronyms" describe the short forms that take selected characters from a multi-character word.

For example, in Chinese, "university" ({{lang|zh-hant|大學}}/{{lang|zh-hans|大学}}, literally "great learning") is usually abbreviated simply as {{lang|zh|大}} ("great") when used with the name of the institute. So ''[[Peking University]]'' ({{lang|zh-hans|北京大学}}) is commonly shortened to {{lang|zh|北大}} ({{abbr|lit.|literally}} "north-great") by also only taking the first character of ''Peking'', the "northern capital" ({{zh | c=北京| p=Beijing | labels=no}}). In some cases, however, other characters than the first can be selected. For example, the local short form of ''[[Hong Kong University]]'' ({{lang|zh-hant|香港大學}}) uses ''Kong'' ({{lang|zh-hant|港大}}) rather than ''Hong''.

There are also cases where some longer phrases are abbreviated drastically, especially in Chinese politics, where proper nouns were initially translated from Soviet Leninist terms. For instance, the full name of China's highest ruling council, the [[Politburo Standing Committee]] (PSC), is "Standing Committee of the Central Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China" (中国共产党中央政治局常务委员会). The term then reduced the "Communist Party of China" part of its name through acronyms, then the "Standing Committee" part, again through acronyms, to create "中共中央政治局常委". Alternatively, it omitted the "Communist Party" part altogether, creating "Politburo Standing Committee" (政治局常委会), and eventually just "Standing Committee" (常委会). The PSC's members full designations are "Member of the Standing Committee of the Central Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China" (中国共产党中央政治局常务委员会委员); this was eventually drastically reduced to simply ''Changwei'' (常委), with the term ''Ruchang'' (入常) used increasingly for officials destined for a future seat on the PSC. In another example, the word "全国人民代表大会" ([[National People's Congress]]) can be broken into four parts: "全国" = "the whole nation", "人民" = "people", "代表" = "representatives", "大会" = "conference". Yet, in its short form "人大" (literally "man/people big"), only the first characters from the second and the fourth parts are selected; the first part ("全国") and the third part ("代表") are simply ignored. In describing such abbreviations, the term ''initialism'' is inapplicable.{{Original research inline|date=November 2012}}

Many proper nouns become shorter and shorter over time. For example, the [[CCTV New Year's Gala]], whose full name is literally read as "China Central Television Spring Festival Joint Celebration Evening Gala" (中国中央电视台春节联欢晚会) was first shortened to "Spring Festival Joint Celebration Evening Gala" (春节联欢晚会), but eventually referred to as simply ''Chunwan'' (春晚). Along the same vein, ''Zhongguo Zhongyang Dianshi Tai'' (中国中央电视台) was reduced to ''Yangshi'' (央视) in the mid-2000s.

====Korean====
Many aspects of academics in Korea follow similar acronym patterns as Chinese, owing to the languages' commonalities, like using the word for "big" or "great" i.e. ''dae'' ({{lang|ko-Hang|대}}), to refer to universities ({{lang|ko-Hang|대학}}; ''daehak,'' literally "great learning" although "big school" is an acceptable alternate). They can be interpreted similar to American university appellations, such as "UPenn" or "Texas Tech."

Some acronyms are shortened forms of the school's name, like how [[Hongik University]] ({{lang|ko-Hang|홍익대학교}}, ''Hongik Daehakgyo'') is shortened to ''Hongdae'' ({{lang|ko-Hang|홍대}}, "Hong, the big [school]" or "Hong-U") Other acronyms can refer to the university's main subject, e.g. [[Korea National University of Education]] ({{lang|ko-Hang|한국교원대학교}}, ''Hanguk Gyowon Daehakgyo'') is shortened to ''Gyowondae'' (교원대, "Big Ed." or "Ed.-U"). Other schools use a Koreanized version of their English acronym. The [[KAIST|Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology]] ({{lang|ko-Hang|한국과학기술원}}, ''Hanguk Gwahak Gisulwon'') is referred to as KAIST ({{lang|ko-Hang|카이스트}}, ''Kaiseuteu'') in both English and Korean. The 3 most prestigious schools in Korea are known as SKY (스카이, ''seukai''), combining the first letter of their English names ('''S'''eoul National, '''K'''orea, and '''Y'''onsei Universities). In addition, the College Scholastic Ability Test ({{lang|ko-Hang|대학수학능력시험}}, ''Daehak Suhang Neungryeok Siheom'') is shortened to ''Suneung'' ({{lang|ko-Hang|수능}}, "S.A.").

====Japanese====
{{main|Japanese abbreviated and contracted words}}
The [[Japanese language]] makes extensive use of abbreviations, but only some of these are acronyms.

Chinese-based words ([[Sino-Japanese vocabulary]]) uses similar acronym formation to Chinese, like {{nihongo|''Tōdai''|東大}} for {{nihongo|''Tōkyō Daigaku''|東京大学|Tokyo University}}. In some cases alternative pronunciations are used, as in [[Saikyō Line|Saikyō]] for 埼京, from {{nihongo|''[[Saitama, Saitama|Saitama]]'' + ''[[Tōkyo]]''|埼玉＋東京}}, rather than Sai'''tō'''.

Non-Chinese foreign borrowings ([[gairaigo]]) are instead frequently abbreviated as [[clipped compound]]s, rather than acronyms, using several initial sounds. This is visible in [[katakana]] transcriptions of foreign words, but is also found with native words (written in [[hiragana]]). For example, the ''[[Pokémon]]'' media franchise's name originally stood for "pocket monsters" ({{lang|ja-Kana|'''ポケ'''ット·'''モン'''スター}} → {{lang|ja-Kana|ポケモン}}), which is still the long-form of the name in Japanese, and "[[wāpuro]]" stands for "[[word processor]]" ({{lang|ja-Kana|'''ワー'''ド·'''プロ'''セッサー}} → {{lang|ja-Kana|ワープロ}}).

====German====
To a greater degree than English does, German tends toward acronyms that use initial syllables rather than initial single letters, although it uses many of the latter type as well. Some examples of the syllabic type are ''[[Gestapo]]'' rather than ''GSP'' (for ''{{lang|de|Geheime Staatspolizei}}'', 'secret state police'); ''{{lang|de|Flak}}'' rather than ''FAK'' (for ''{{lang|de|Fliegerabwehrkanone}}'', [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] gun); ''{{lang|de|Kripo}}'' rather than ''KP'' (for ''{{lang|de|[[Kriminalpolizei]]}}'', detective division police). The extension of such contraction to a pervasive or whimsical degree has been mockingly labeled ''{{lang|de|[[wikt:de:Aküfi|Aküfi]]}}'' (for ''{{lang|de|Abkürzungsfimmel}}'', strange habit of abbreviating). Examples of {{lang|de|Aküfi}} include ''{{lang|de|Vokuhila}}'' (for ''{{lang|de|vorne kurz, hinten lang}}'', short in the front, long in the back, i.e., a [[Mullet (haircut)|mullet]]) and the mocking of [[Adolf Hitler]]'s title as ''{{lang|de|[[Gröfaz]]}}'' (''{{lang|de|Größter Feldherr aller Zeiten}}'', Greatest General of all Times).

====Hebrew====
{{Main|Hebrew acronyms}}

It is common to take more than just one initial letter from each of the words composing the acronym; regardless of this, the abbreviation sign [[gershayim]] {{angle bracket|״}} is always written between the second-last and last letters of the non-inflected form of the acronym, even if by this it separates letters of the same original word.  Examples (keep in mind Hebrew reads right-to-left): {{lang|he|ארה״ב|rtl=yes}} (for {{lang|he|ארצות הברית|rtl=yes}}, the United States); {{lang|he|ברה״מ|rtl=yes}} (for {{lang|he|ברית המועצות|rtl=yes}}, the Soviet Union); {{lang|he|ראשל״צ|rtl=yes}} (for {{lang|he|ראשון לציון|rtl=yes}}, [[Rishon LeZion]]); {{lang|he|ביה״ס|rtl=yes}} (for {{lang|he|בית הספר|rtl=yes}}, the school). An example that takes only the initial letters from its component words is {{lang|he|צה״ל|rtl=yes}} (''Tzahal'', for {{lang|he|צבא הגנה לישראל|rtl=yes}}, [[Israel Defense Forces]]). In inflected forms the abbreviation sign [[gershayim]] remains between the second-last and last letters of the non-inflected form of the acronym (e.g. "report", singular: {{lang|he|דו״ח|rtl=yes}}, plural: {{lang|he|דו״חות|rtl=yes}}; "squad commander", masculine: {{lang|he|מ״כ|rtl=yes}}, feminine: {{lang|he|מ״כית|rtl=yes}}).

====Indonesian====
{{see also|List of Indonesian acronyms and abbreviations}}
There is also a widespread use of acronyms in [[Indonesia]] in every aspect of social life. For example, the ''[[Golkar]]'' political party stands for Partai ''Gol''ongan ''Kar''ya, ''[[Monas]]'' stands for "''Mo''numen ''Nas''ional" (National Monument), the ''Angkot'' public transport stands for "''Ang''kutan ''Kot''a" ([[Share taxi#indonesia|city public transportation]]), ''warnet'' stands for "''war''ung inter''net''" ([[internet cafe]]), and many others. Some acronyms are considered formal (or officially adopted), while many more are considered informal, [[slang]] or [[colloquial]].

The capital's metropolitan area ([[Jakarta]] and its surrounding [[satellite city|satellite regions]]), ''[[Jabodetabek]]'', is another infamous acronym. This stands for ''Ja''karta-''Bo''gor-''De''pok-''Ta''ngerang-''Bek''asi. Many highways are also named by the acronym method; e.g. ''Jalan Tol'' (Toll Road) ''Jagorawi'' (''Ja''karta-Bo''gor''-Ci''awi'') and ''Purbaleunyi'' (''Pur''wakarta-''Ba''ndung-Ci''leunyi''), Joglo Semar (''Jog''ja-so''lo''-''semar''ang).

In some languages, especially those that use certain [[alphabets]], many acronyms come from the governmental use, particularly in the military and law enforcement services. The [[Indonesian military]] (TNI—''Tentara Nasional Indonesia'') and [[Indonesian police]] (POLRI—''Kepolisian Republik Indonesia'') are infamous for heavy acronyms use. Examples include the ''[[Kopassus]]'' (''Ko''mando ''Pas''ukan Khu''sus''; [[Special Forces]] Command), ''[[Kopaska]]'' (''Ko''mando ''Pas''ukan ''Ka''tak; [[Frogmen]] Command), ''Kodim'' (''Ko''mando ''Di''strik ''M''iliter; Military District Command—one of the Indonesian army's [[administrative divisions]]), ''Serka'' (''Ser''san ''K''ep''a''la; Head [[Sergeant]]), ''Akmil'' (''Ak''ademi ''Mil''iter; Military Academy—in [[Magelang]]) and many other terms regarding [[military ranks|ranks]], units, divisions, procedures, etc.

Heavy acronym use by Indonesians, makes it difficult for foreigners and learners of [[Indonesian language|Bahasa Indonesia]] to seek information and news in Indonesian [[media (communication)|media]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

====Russian====
Acronyms that use parts of words (not necessarily syllables) are commonplace in Russian as well, e.g. {{lang|ru|Газпром}} ([[Gazprom]]), for {{lang|ru|Газовая промышленность}} (''{{transl|ru|Gazovaya promyshlennost}}'', gas industry). There are also initialisms, such as СМИ (''SMI'', for {{lang|ru|средства массовой информации}} ''{{transl|ru|sredstva massovoy informatsii}}'', means of mass informing, i.e. [[mass media]]). Another Russian acronym, {{lang|ru|ГУЛаг}} ([[GULag]]) combines two initials and three letters of the final word: it stands for {{lang|ru|Главное управление лагерей}} (''{{transl|ru|Glavnoe upravlenie lagerey}}'', Chief Administration of Camps).

Historically, [[OTMA]] was an acronym sometimes used by the daughters of [[Emperor]] [[Nicholas II of Russia]] and his consort, [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|Alexandra Feodorovna]], as a group nickname for themselves, built from the first letter of each girl's name in the order of their births : Olga, Tatiana, Maria and Anastasia.

====Swahili====
In [[Swahili language|Swahili]], acronyms are common for naming organizations such as TUKI, which stands for ''{{lang|sw|Taasisi ya Uchunguzi wa Kiswahili}}'' (the Institute for Swahili Research). Multiple initial letters (often the initial syllable of words) are often drawn together, as seen more in some languages than others.

====Vietnamese====
In [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], which has an abundance of compound words, initialisms are very commonly used for both proper and common nouns. Examples include ''[[wikt:TP.HCM|TP.HCM]]'' (''{{lang|vi|Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh}}'', [[Ho Chi Minh City]]), ''[[wikt:THPT|THPT]]'' (''{{lang|vi|trung học phổ thông}}'', high school), ''[[wikt:CLB|CLB]]'' (''{{lang|vi|câu lạc bộ}}'', club), ''[[wikt:CSDL|CSDL]]'' (''{{lang|vi|cơ sở dữ liệu}}'', database), ''[[wikt:NXB|NXB]]'' (''{{lang|vi|nhà xuất bản}}'', publisher), ''[[wikt:ÔBACE|ÔBACE]]'' (''{{lang|vi|ông bà anh chị em}}'', a general form of address), and ''[[wikt:CTTĐVN|CTTĐVN]]'' (''{{lang|vi|các Thánh tử đạo Việt Nam}}'', [[Vietnamese Martyrs]]). Longer examples include ''[[wikt:CHXHCNVN|CHXHCNVN]]'' (''{{lang|vi|Cộng hòa Xã hội chủ nghĩa Việt Nam}}'', [[Vietnam|Socialist Republic of Vietnam]]) and ''[[wikt:MTDTGPMNVN|MTDTGPMNVN]]'' (''{{lang|vi|Mặt trận Dân tộc Giải phóng miền Nam Việt Nam}}'', [[Viet Cong]]). Long initialisms have become widespread in legal contexts in [[Vietnam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Từ viết tắt|trans-title=Abbreviations|publisher=[[BBC Academy]]|accessdate=September 4, 2017|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/academy/vietnamese/article/art20131007102738486|language=vi|quote=Chưa kể cách viết này còn dễ bị cho là lười biếng hoặc tỏ ra quan trọng, vì đây là cách chép nguyên xi, máy móc các cụm từ viết tắt từ văn bản pháp quy của chính quyền, như TTLT-VKSNDTC-TANDTC, khá phổ biến ở Việt Nam hiện nay.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also common for a writer to coin an ad-hoc initialism for repeated use in an article.

Each letter in an initialism corresponds to one [[morpheme]]—that is, one syllable. When the first letter of a syllable has a tone mark or other diacritic, the diacritic may be omitted from the initialism, for example ''ĐNA'' or ''ĐNÁ'' for ''{{lang|vi|Đông Nam Á}}'' ([[Southeast Asia]]) and ''LMCA'' or ''LMCÂ'' for ''Liên minh châu Âu'' ([[European Union]]). The letter "[[Ư]]" is often replaced by "W" in initialisms to avoid confusion with "U", for example ''UBTWMTTQVN'' or ''UBTƯMTTQVN'' for ''Ủy ban Trung ương Mặt trận Tổ quốc Việt Nam'' (Central Committee of the [[Vietnamese Fatherland Front]]).

Initialisms are purely a written convenience, being pronounced the same way as their expansions. As the [[Vietnamese alphabet#Letter names and pronunciation|names of many Vietnamese letters]] are disyllabic, it would be less convenient to pronounce an initialism by its individual letters. Acronyms pronounced as words are rare in Vietnamese, occurring when an acronym itself is borrowed from another language. Examples include ''{{linktext|SIĐA|lang=vi}}'' ({{IPA-vi|s̪i˧˧ ˀɗaː˧˧|pron}}), a respelling of the French acronym ''SIDA'' ([[AIDS]]); ''{{linktext|VOA|lang=vi}}'' ({{IPA-vi|vwaː˧˧|pron}}), a literal reading of the English initialism for [[Voice of America]]; and ''[[NASA]]'' ({{IPA-vi|naː˧˧ zaː˧˧|pron}}), borrowed directly from the English acronym.

As in [[#Chinese|Chinese]], many compound words can be shortened to the first syllable when forming a longer word. For example, the term [[Viet Cong|Việt Cộng]] is derived from the first syllables of "Việt Nam" (Vietnam) and "Cộng sản" (communist). This mechanism is limited to [[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary]]. Unlike with Chinese, such shortened words are considered [[portmanteau]] words or [[blend word]]s rather than acronyms or initialisms, because the [[Vietnamese alphabet]] still requires each component word to be written as more than one character.

===General grammatical considerations===

====Declension====
In languages where nouns are [[declension|declined]], various methods are used. An example is [[Finnish language|Finnish]], where a colon is used to separate inflection from the letters:
*An acronym is pronounced as a word: Nato {{IPA-fi|nato|}}—''{{lang|fi|Natoon}}'' {{IPA|[natoːn]}} "into Nato", Nasalta "from [[NASA]]"
*An acronym is pronounced as letters: EU {{IPA|[eː uː]}}—''{{lang|fi|EU:hun}}'' {{IPA|[eː uːhun]}} "into EU"
*An acronym is interpreted as words: EU {{IPA|[euroːpan unioni]}}—''{{lang|fi|EU:iin}}'' {{IPA|[euroːpan unioniːn]}} "into EU"
The process above is similar to how, in English, hyphens are used for clarity when prefixes are added to acronyms, thus ''pre-NATO policy'' (rather than ''preNATO'').

====Lenition====
In languages such as [[Scottish Gaelic]] and [[Irish language|Irish]], where [[lenition]] (initial consonant mutation) is commonplace, acronyms must also be modified in situations where case and context dictate it. In the case of Scottish Gaelic, a lower case "h" is added after the initial consonant; for example, ''[[BBC Scotland]]'' in the genitive case would be written as ''BhBC Alba'', with the acronym pronounced "VBC". Likewise, the Gaelic acronym for "television" (''gd: telebhisean'') is ''TBh'', pronounced "TV", as in English.

==Extremes==
*The longest acronym, according to the 1965 edition of ''Acronyms, Initialisms and Abbreviations Dictionary'', is ADCOMSUBORDCOMPHIBSPAC, a [[United States Navy]] term that stands for "Administrative Command, Amphibious Forces, Pacific Fleet Subordinate Command."  Another term COMNAVSEACOMBATSYSENGSTA, which stands for "Commander, Naval Sea Systems Combat Engineering Station" is longer but the word "Combat" is not shortened.
*The world's longest acronym, according to the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'', is НИИОМТПЛАБОПАРМБЕТЖЕЛБЕТРАБСБОМОНИМОНКОНОТДТЕХСТРОМОНТ {{transl|ru|(NIIOMTPLABOPARMBETZHELBETRABSBOMONIMONKONOTDTEKHSTROMONT)}}. However, this is more precisely a combination acronym/[[clipped compound]], as multiple initial letters of some constituent words are used. The 56-letter term (54 in [[Cyrillic]]) is from the ''Concise Dictionary of Soviet Terminology'' and means "The laboratory for shuttering, reinforcement, concrete and ferroconcrete operations for composite-monolithic and monolithic constructions of the Department of the Technology of Building-assembly operations of the Scientific Research Institute of the Organization for building mechanization and technical aid of the Academy of Building and Architecture of the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]]." ({{lang|ru|'''н'''аучно-'''и'''сследовательская '''[...]''' '''лаб'''оратория '''оп'''ераций по '''арм'''ированию '''бет'''она и '''жел'''езо'''бет'''онных '''раб'''от по сооружению '''сбо'''рно-'''мон'''олитных '''и''' '''мон'''олитных '''кон'''струкций '''отд'''ела '''тех'''нологии '''стро'''ительно-'''монт'''ажного управления}})
*The card-game ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]'' has a playing card called "Our Market Research Shows That Players Like Really Long Card Names So We Made this Card to Have the Absolute Longest Card Name Ever Elemental", with text on it saying: "Just call it OMRSTPLRLCNSWMTCTHTALCNEE for short."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=74237|title=Our Market Research Shows That Players Like Really Long Card Names So We Made this Card to Have the Absolute Longest Card Name Ever Elemental (Unhinged) - Gatherer - Magic: The Gathering|website=gatherer.wizards.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Acronym Finder''' ('''AF''') is a free online searchable dictionary and database of [[abbreviation]]s ([[acronym]]s, [[initialism]]s, and others) and their meanings.

The entries are classified into categories such as ''[[Information technology|Information Technology]], Military/Government, Science, [[Slang]]/[[Pop culture|Pop Culture]]'' etc. It also contains a database of [[United States|US]] and [[Canada|Canadian]] postal codes. For abbreviations with multiple meanings they are listed by popularity with the most common one being listed first. {{As of | 2018}} it claims to have over a million "''human-edited''" and verified [[definition]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.acronymfinder.com/about.asp|title=About AcronymFinder.com|website=www.acronymfinder.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Acronym Finder was registered and the database put online by Michael K. Molloy of Colorado in 1997 but he began compiling it in 1985 working as a computer systems officer for the [[United States Air Force|USAF]].&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB116865656948675976|title=BTW, if you need Info About C4ISR, Read This ASAP|author=Barry Newman|date=January 13, 2007|publisher=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Molloy first saw the need of an acronym list while integrating computers at the [[Randolph Air Force Base]] in [[Texas]] His first acronym list running up-to 30 pages. When he had retired and put AF online in 1997, his list already had 43,000 acronyms. It began mainly as a list of Military/Government abbreviations before expanding to other areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.voanews.com/a/2012630.html|title=Website of the Week — Acronym Finder (MP3)|work=VOA|access-date=2018-04-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Molloy and his wife served as the editors of the website verifying user submissions for abbreviations and adding others they found to the database. Molloy has also provided opinions on abbreviations such as "''MSG''" which [[Madison Square Garden]] wanted as a domain name (''msg.com'') claiming trademark to the abbreviated letters. He stated that MSG also stood for more common things such as [[monosodium glutamate]] and message among others. The Garden in the end settled out of court and came to own [https://www.msg.com/ msg.com].

The website was maintained under Mountain Data Systems, LLC by Molloy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/11239556|title=Acronym finder [digital] : AF. in SearchWorks catalog|website=searchworks.stanford.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.acronymfinder.com/about.asp|title=About AcronymFinder.com|last=|first=|date=|website=acronymfinder.com|language=en|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130628092508/http://www.acronymfinder.com/about.asp|archive-date=2013-06-28|dead-url=yes|access-date=2018-04-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; before being sold off and eventually coming under the ownership of '''''Farlex, Inc.''''' publishers of [[TheFreeDictionary.com|Thefreedictionary.com]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.farlex.acronym.finder|title=Acronym Finder - Apps on Google Play|website=play.google.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''almanac''' (also spelled ''almanack'' and ''almanach'') is an [[annual publication]] listing a set of events forthcoming in the next year.

It includes information like [[weather forecasting|weather forecasts]], farmers' [[planting]] dates, [[tide table]]s, and other [[table (information)|tabular]] [[data]] often arranged according to the [[calendar]]. [[celestial event|Celestial]] figures and various statistics are found in almanacs, such as the [[sunrise|rising]] and [[sunset|setting]] times of the [[Sun]] and [[Moon]], dates of [[eclipse]]s, hours of high and low [[tide]]s, and [[religious festival]]s.

A calendar, which is a system for time keeping, in written form is usually produced as a most simple almanac: it includes additional information about the day of the week on which a particular day falls, major holidays, the phases of the moon, earthquake hazard levels etc. The set of events noted in an almanac are selected in view of a more or less specific group of readers e.g. farmers, sailors, astronomers or others.

== Etymology ==

The etymology of the word is unclear. It is suggested{{by whom|date=June 2018}} the word ''almanac'' derives from a Greek word meaning ''calendar''.  However, that word appears only once in antiquity, by Eusebius who quotes Porphyry as to the Coptic Egyptian use of astrological charts (''almenichiaká''). The earliest almanacs were calendars that included agricultural, astronomical, or meteorological data. But it is highly unlikely [[Roger Bacon]] received the word from this etymology: "Notwithstanding the suggestive sound and use of this word (of which however the real form is very uncertain), the difficulties of connecting it historically either with the [[Spanish Arabic]] manākh, or with [[Medieval Latin]] almanach without Arabic intermediation, seem insurmountable."&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest documented use of the word in any language is in Latin in 1267 by [[Roger Bacon]], where it meant a set of tables detailing movements of heavenly bodies including the moon.

One etymology report says "The ultimate source of the word is obscure. Its first syllable, al-, and its general relevance to medieval science and technology, strongly suggest an Arabic origin, but no convincing candidate has been found".&lt;ref&gt;"Word Origins" by John Ayto (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Another report similarly says of ''almanac'': "First seen in Roger Bacon. Apparently from Spanish Arabic, ''al-manakh'', but this is not an Arabic word....The word remains a puzzle."&lt;ref&gt;Quote from [https://archive.org/details/etymologicaldict00weekuoft/ ''An Etymological Dictionary of Modern English'', by Ernest Weekley (1921)]. Similarly, [https://archive.org/details/etymologicaldict00skeauoft ''An Etymological Dictionary'' by Walter W. Skeat (1888)] concludes that the construction of an Arabic source for almanac "is not satisfactory".&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[New English Dictionary on Historical Principles|Oxford English Dictionary]]'' similarly says "the word has no etymon in Arabic" but indirect circumstantial evidence "points to a Spanish Arabic ''al-manākh''".&lt;ref&gt;"Almanac" in [https://archive.org/stream/oed01arch#page/244/mode/1up ''New English Dictionary on Historical Principles''] (which has an extra "note as to the origin and history of the word ''almanac''").&lt;/ref&gt;

The reason why the proposed Arabic word is speculatively spelled ''al-manākh'' is that the spelling occurred as "almanach", as well as almanac (and Roger Bacon used both spellings). The earliest use of the word was in the context of astronomy calendars.

The prestige of the [[Tables of Toledo]] and other [[astronomy in medieval Islam|medieval Arabic astronomy works]] at the time of the word's emergence in the West, together with the absence of the word in Arabic, suggest it may have been invented in the West and is pseudo-Arabic. At that time in the West, it would have been prestigious to attach an Arabic appellation to a set of astronomical tables. Also around that time, prompted by that motive, the Latin writer [[Pseudo-Geber]] wrote under an Arabic pseudonym. (The later alchemical word ''[[alkahest]]'' is known to be pseudo-Arabic.)

== History ==

=== Hemerologies and parapegmata ===

The earlier texts considered to be almanacs have been found in the [[Near East]], dating back to the middle of the second millennium BC. They have been called generally hemerologies, from the Greek ''hēmerā'', meaning "day". Among them is the so-called [[Babylonian Almanac]], which lists favorable and unfavorable days with advice on what to do on each of them. Successive variants and versions aimed at different readership have been found.&lt;ref&gt;Livingstone, A. (1998) "The use of magic in the Assyrian and Babylonian hemerologies and menolgies." Studi epigrafici e linguistici sul Vicino Oriente antico 15 (1998) 59.&lt;/ref&gt; Egyptian lists of good and bad moments, three times each day, have also been found. Many of these prognostics were connected with celestial events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Porceddu, S., Jetsu, L., Lyytinen, J., Kajatkari, P., Lehtinen, J., Markkanen, T, Toivari-Viitala, J.|title=Evidence of Periodicity in Ancient Egyptian Calendars of Lucky and Unlucky Days|journal = Cambridge Archaeological Journal|volume =18|issue=3|year = 2008|pages = 327–339|doi=10.1017/S0959774308000395|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=2374180|bibcode=2008CArcJ..18..327P}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Jetsu, L., Porceddu, S., Lyytinen, J., Kajatkari, P., Lehtinen, J., Markkanen, T, Toivari-Viitala, J.|title=Did the Ancient Egyptians Record the Period of the Eclipsing Binary Algol&amp;nbsp;— The Raging One? |journal = The Astrophysical Journal|volume =773|issue=1|year = 2013|pages = A1 (14pp)|doi = 10.1088/0004-637X/773/1/1|bibcode=2013ApJ...773....1J|arxiv = 1204.6206 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | author=Jetsu, L. | author2=Porceddu, S. | title=Shifting Milestones of Natural Sciences: The Ancient Egyptian Discovery of Algol's Period Confirmed | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 10 |issue = 12 | date = 2015 | pages = e.0144140 (23pp) | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0144140 | url = http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0144140 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The flooding of the Nile valley, a most important event in ancient Egypt, was expected to occur at the summer solstice but as the civil calendar had exactly 365 days, over the centuries  the date was drifting in the calendar.&lt;ref&gt;The new year coincides with the summer solstice once in 1441 years, which is known as the [[sothic period]].&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[heliacal rising]] of Sirius was used for its prediction and this practice, the observation of some star and its connecting to some event apparently spread.

The Greek almanac, known as parapegma, has existed in the form an inscribed stone on which the days of the month were indicated by movable pegs inserted into bored holes, hence the name. There were also written texts and according to [[Diogenes Laërtius]], ''Parapegma'' was the title of a book by [[Democritus]].&lt;ref&gt;Lehoux D., ''Parapegmata, Astrology, Weather, and Calendars in the Ancient World'', (thesis), National Library of Canada, 2000; includes a list of surviving parapegmata (plural of 'parapegma') and bibliography&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ptolemy]], the [[Alexandria]]n astronomer (2nd century) wrote a treatise, ''Phaseis''—"phases of fixed stars and collection of weather-changes" is the translation of its full title—the core of which is a ''parapegma'', a list of dates of seasonally regular weather changes, first appearances and last appearances of [[star]]s or [[constellation]]s at sunrise or sunset, and solar events such as [[solstice]]s, all organized according to the solar year. With the astronomical computations were expected weather phenomena, composed as a digest of observations made by various authorities of the past. ''Parapegmata'' had been composed for centuries.

Ptolemy believed that astronomical phenomena caused the changes in seasonal weather; his explanation of why there was not an exact correlation of these events was that the physical influences of other heavenly bodies also came into play. Hence for him, weather prediction was a special division of [[astrology]].&lt;ref name="ptolemy"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/~ajones/ptolgeog/astroworks.html |title=Ptolemy's Astronomical Works (other than the Almagest) |accessdate=2007-04-16 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208073111/http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/~ajones/ptolgeog/astroworks.html |archivedate=2007-02-08 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ephemerides, zijs and tables ===

The origins of the almanac can be connected to ancient [[Babylonian astronomy]], when tables of planetary periods were produced in order to predict lunar and planetary phenomena.&lt;ref name=Glick&gt;{{Harvnb|Glick|Livesey|Wallis|2005|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar treatises called [[Zij]] were later composed in medieval [[Islamic astronomy]].

The modern almanac differs from Babylonian, Ptolemaic and Zij tables in the sense that "the entries found in the almanacs give directly the positions of the celestial bodies and need no further computation", in contrast to the more common "auxiliary astronomical tables" based on Ptolemy's ''Almagest''. The earliest known almanac in this modern sense is the ''Almanac of Azarqueil'' written in 1088 by [[Abū Ishāq Ibrāhīm al-Zarqālī]] (Latinized as Arzachel) in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], [[al-Andalus]]. The work provided the true daily positions of the sun, moon and planets for four years from 1088 to 1092, as well as many other related tables. A [[Latin]] translation and adaptation of the work appeared as the ''[[Tables of Toledo]]'' in the 12th century and the ''[[Alfonsine tables]]'' in the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Glick|Livesey|Wallis|2005|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify source|date=January 2012}}

=== Medieval examples ===
[[File:MS. 8932. Medieval folding almanac (15th century) Wellcome L0075681.jpg|thumb|left|MS. 8932. Medieval folding almanac (15th century)&lt;ref&gt;"MS. 8932.

After almanacs were devised, people still saw little difference between predicting the movements of the stars and tides, and predicting the future in the [[divination]] sense. Early almanacs therefore contained general [[horoscope]]s, as well as the more concrete information. In 1150 [[Solomon Jarchus]] created such an almanac considered to be among the first modern almanacs. Copies of 12th century almanacs are found in the British Museum, and in the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge. In 1300, [[Petrus de Dacia (mathematician)|Petrus de Dacia]] created an almanac (Savilian Library, Oxford). This was the same year Roger Bacon, OFM, produced his as well. In 1327 [[Walter de Elvendene]] created an almanac and later on [[John Somers, 1st Baron Somers|John Somers]] of Oxford, in 1380. In 1386 Nicholas de Lynne, Oxford produced an almanac. In 1457 the first printed almanac was published at Mainz, by Gutenberg (eight years before the famous Bible). Regio-Montanus produced an almanac in 1472 (Nuremberg, 1472), which was continued in print for several centuries in many editions. In 1497 the ''[[Sheapheard’s Kalendar]]'', translated from French ([[Richard Pynson]]) became the first English printed almanac.

=== Early modern era ===
[[File:Book of incantations f. 25r - Prophetic Almanack.png|thumb|left|An English Prophetic Almanack, 1825]]

By the second half of the 16th century, yearly almanacs were being produced in England by men such as Anthony Askham, Thomas Buckminster, John Dade and Gabriel Frende. In the 17th century, English almanacs were bestsellers, second only to the Bible; by the middle of the century, 400,000 almanacs were being produced annually (a complete listing can be found in the [http://estc.bl.uk/F/?func=file&amp;file_name=login-bl-estc English Short Title Catalogue]). Until its deregulation in 1775, the Stationers' Company maintained a lucrative monopoly over almanac publication in England.&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, Martyn. (2011). Books: A living history. Los Angeles, CA: Getty Publications. pp. 123&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Allestree (who is not the same as this [[Richard Allestree]]) wrote one of the more popular English almanacs, producing yearly volumes from 1617 to 1643, but his is by no means the earliest or the longest-running almanac.

In British America, William Pierce of Harvard College published the first [[American almanac]] entitled, ''An Almanac for New England for the year 1639'' Cambridge, Massachusetts. Harvard became the first center for the annual publication of almanacs with various editors including [[Samuel Danforth]], Oakes, Cheever, Chauncey, Dudley, Foster, et alia. An almanac maker going under the pseudonym of Poor Richard, Knight of the Burnt Island began to publish ''[[Poor Robin's Almanack]]'' one of the first comic almanacs that parodied these horoscopes in its 1664 issue, saying "This month we may expect to hear of the Death of some Man, Woman, or Child, either in Kent or Christendom." Other noteworthy comic almanacs include those published from 1687-1702 by John Tully of Saybrook, Connecticut.

The most important early American almanacs were made from 1726-1775 by [[Nathaniel Ames]] of Dedham, Massachusetts. A few years later [[James Franklin (printer)|James Franklin]] began publishing the [[Rhode-Island Almanack]] beginning in 1728. Five years later his brother [[Benjamin Franklin]] began publishing ''[[Poor Richard's Almanack]]'' from 1733-1758. [[Benjamin Banneker]], a free African American, composed a series of almanacs from 1792-1797.

=== Contemporary use ===

Currently published almanacs such as ''[[Whitaker's Almanack]]'' have expanded their scope and contents beyond that of their historical counterparts. Modern almanacs include a comprehensive presentation of statistical and descriptive data covering the entire world. Contents also include discussions of topical developments and a summary of recent historical events. Other currently published almanacs (ca. 2006) include ''[[TIME Almanac with Information Please]]'', ''[[World Almanac|World Almanac and Book of Facts]]'', ''[[Farmers' Almanac|The Farmer's Almanac]]'' and ''[[Old Farmer's Almanac|The Old Farmer's Almanac]]'' and The Almanac for Farmers &amp; City Folk. The ''Inverness Almanac'' [http://www.invernessalmanac.com]," an almanac/literary journal, was published in West Marin, California, from 2015 to 2016. In 2007, Harrowsmith Country Life Magazine launched a Canadian Almanac, written in Canada, with all-Canadian content. The nonprofit agrarian organization the Greenhorns [http://www.thegreenhorns.net/] currently publishes ''The New Farmer's Almanac'' as a resource for young farmers.

Major topics covered by almanacs (reflected by their tables of contents) include: [[geography]], [[government]], [[demographics]], [[agriculture]], [[economics]] and [[business]], [[health]] and [[medicine]], [[religion]], [[mass media]], [[transportation]], [[science]] and [[technology]], [[sport]], and [[award]]s/[[prize]]s.

Other examples include ''[[The Almanac of American Politics]]'' published by [[Columbia Books &amp; Information Services]], ''The Almanac of American Literature'', and ''The [[Almanac of British Politics]]''.

From 1985 to 1990, approximately 53 per cent of all almanac sales sold in the United States were sold through the "Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego? (1985)" computer game pack that included a complimentary ''[[World Almanac|World Almanac and Book of Facts]].''

The [[GPS almanac]], as part of the data transmitted by each GPS satellite, contains coarse orbit and status information for all satellites in the constellation, an ionospheric model, and information to relate GPS derived time to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Hence the GPS almanac provide a similar goal as the ancient Babylonian almanac, to find celestial bodies.

An '''annotation''' is a [[metadata|metadatum]] (e.g. a post, explanation, [[markup language|markup]])  attached to location or other data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/annotation|title=Definition of ANNOTATION|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature and education==

===Textual scholarship===
{{Main|Textual scholarship}}
[[Textual scholarship]] is a discipline that often uses the technique of annotation to describe or add additional historical context to texts and physical documents.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

===Student uses===
Students often [[Highlighter|highlight]] passages in books in order to refer back to key phrases easily, or add [[marginalia]] to aid studying.  One educational technique when analyzing prose literature is to have students or teachers circle the names of [[Character (arts)|characters]] and put rectangular boxes around phrases identifying the [[Setting (narrative)|setting]] of a given scene.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

[[Annotated bibliography|Annotated bibliographies]] add commentary on the relevance or quality of each source, in addition to the usual bibliographic information that merely identifies the source.

===Learning and instruction ===
From a cognitive perspective annotation has an important role in learning and instruction.  As part of guided noticing it involves highlighting, naming or labelling and commenting aspects of visual representations to help focus learners' attention on specific visual aspects. In other words, it means the assignment of typological representations (culturally meaningful categories), to topological representations (e.g. images).&lt;ref&gt;Pea, R. D. (2006).

Dordrecht: Springer&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially important when experts, such as medical doctors, interpret visualizations in detail and explain their interpretations to others, for example by means of digital technology.&lt;ref&gt;Coiera E.

Using Language. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; The value of annotation has been empirically confirmed, for example, in a study which shows that in computer-based teleconsultations the integration of image annotation and speech leads to significantly improved knowledge exchange compared with the use of images and speech without annotation.&lt;ref&gt;Pimmer, C., Mateescu, M., Zahn, C., &amp; Genewein, U.

=== Text documents===
[[Markup language]]s like [[XML]] and [[HTML]] annotate text in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from that text.  They can be used to add information about the desired visual presentation, or machine-readable semantic information, as in the [[semantic web]].&lt;ref name="Web Annotation Data Model"&gt;{{cite web | title = Web Annotation Data Model | url =http://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/ | publisher = [[World Wide Web Consortium]] | date = 11 December 2014 | accessdate = {{CURRENTDAY}} {{User:Ed Poor/this month}} {{CURRENTYEAR}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Source control ===
The "annotate" function (also known as "blame" or "praise") used in [[source control]] systems such as [[Git (software)|Git]], [[Team Foundation Server]] and [[Apache Subversion|Subversion]] determines who [[Revision control#Common vocabulary|committed]] changes to the source code into the repository.  This outputs a copy of the source code where each line is annotated with the name of the last contributor to edit that line (and possibly a revision number).  This can help establish blame in the event a change caused a malfunction, or identify the author of brilliant code.

=== Java annotations ===
{{Main|Java annotation}}
A special case is the [[Java (programming language)|Java programming language]], where annotations can be used as a special form of syntactic [[metadata]] in the source code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/language/annotations.html|title = JDK 5.0 Developer's Guide: Annotations|date = 2007-12-18|accessdate = 2008-03-05|publisher = [[Sun Microsystems]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080306060928/http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/language/annotations.html| archivedate= 6 March 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Classes, methods, variables, parameters and packages may be annotated. The annotations can be embedded in [[class (file format)|class files]] generated by the compiler and may be retained by the [[Java virtual machine]] and thus influence the [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|run-time]] behaviour of an application. It is possible to create meta-annotations out of the existing ones in Java.

==Computational biology==
{{main|DNA annotation}}
Since the 1980s, [[molecular biology]] and [[bioinformatics]] have created the need for [[DNA annotation]]. DNA annotation or genome annotation is the process of identifying the locations of genes and all of the coding regions in a genome and determining what those genes do. An annotation (irrespective of the context) is a note added by way of explanation or commentary. Once a genome is sequenced, it needs to be annotated to make sense of it.

==Imaging==
In the [[digital imaging]] community the term annotation is commonly used for visible [[metadata]] superimposed on an [[digital image|image]] without changing the underlying master image, such as [[sticky note]]s, virtual laser pointers, circles, arrows, and black-outs (cf. [[redaction]]).

In the [[medical imaging]] community, an annotation is often referred to as a [[region of interest]] and is encoded in [[DICOM]] format.

==Law==

In the United States, legal publishers such as [[Thomson West]] and [[Lexis Nexis]] publish annotated versions of [[statutes]], providing information about [[Legal opinions|court cases]] that have interpreted the statutes. Both the federal [[United States Code]] and state statutes are subject to interpretation by the [[courts]], and the annotated statutes are valuable tools in [[legal research]].

==Linguistics==

In [[linguistics]], annotations include comments and [[metadata]]; these non-transcriptional annotations are also [[linguistics|non-linguistic]]. A collection of texts with linguistic annotations is known as a [[corpus linguistics|corpus]] (plural ''corpora''). The Linguistic Annotation Wiki&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://annotation.exmaralda.org/|title=LinguisticAnnotation|website=annotation.exmaralda.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes tools and formats for creating and managing linguistic annotations.

[[File:Apple and Orange - they do not compare.jpg|right|thumb|An apple and an orange]]
[[File:Paul Cézanne 179.jpg|Right|thumb|''Apples and Oranges'', by [[Paul Cézanne]].]]

A comparison of '''apples and oranges''' occurs when two items or groups of items are compared that cannot be practically compared.

The [[idiom]], ''comparing apples and oranges'', refers to the apparent differences between items which are popularly thought to be incomparable or [[unit commensurability|incommensurable]], such as [[apple]]s and [[orange (fruit)|orange]]s. The idiom may also be used to indicate that a [[false analogy]] has been made between two items, such as where an ''apple'' is faulted for not being a good ''orange''.

==Variants==
{{multiple issues|
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2010}}
{{original research|section|date=August 2014}}}}
The idiom is not unique to English. In [[Quebec French]], it may take the form ''comparer des pommes avec des oranges'' (to compare apples and oranges), while in European French the idiom says ''comparer des pommes et des poires'' (to compare apples and pears). In [[Latin America]]n Spanish, it is usually ''comparar papas y boniatos'' (comparing potatoes and sweet potatoes) or commonly for all [[Spanish dialects and varieties|varieties of Spanish]] ''comparar peras con manzanas'' (comparing pears and apples). In some other languages the term for 'orange' derives from 'apple', suggesting not only that a direct comparison between the two is possible, but that it is implicitly present in their names. Fruit other than apples and oranges can also be compared; for example, apples and [[pear]]s are compared in [[Danish language|Danish]], Dutch, German, Spanish, [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], Italian, [[Slovene language|Slovene]], [[Luxembourgish language|Luxembourgish]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], and [[Turkish language|Turkish]]. In fact, in the Spanish-speaking world, a common idiom is ''sumar peras con manzanas'', that is, ''to add pears and apples''; the same thing applies in Italian (''sommare le mele con le pere'') and Romanian (''a aduna merele cu perele''). In Portuguese, the expression is ''comparar laranjas com bananas'' (compare orange to banana).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gazetadopovo.com.br/esportes/osorio-sobre-o-pan-e-as-olimpiadas-estao-comparando-banana-com-laranja-bxxxe6v1cotxnsrh5vowm64pa Olimpíadas: "Estão comparando banana com laranja"], ''Gazeta do Povo'', 15 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In Czech, the idiom ''míchat jablka s hruškami'' literally means 'to mix apples and pears'.

[[Image:Apples.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Not all apples are alike.]]

Some languages use completely different items, such as the [[Serbian language|Serbian]] ''Поредити бабе и жабе'' (comparing grandmothers and toads), or the [[Romanian language|Romanian]] ''baba şi mitraliera'' (the grandmother and the machine gun); ''vaca şi izmenele'' (the cow and the longjohns); or ''țiganul şi carioca'' (the gypsy and the marker), or the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''mor wahanol â mêl a menyn'' (as different as honey and butter), while some languages compare dissimilar properties of dissimilar items. For example, an equivalent [[Danish language|Danish]] idiom, ''Hvad er højest, [[Rundetårn]] eller et tordenskrald?'' means "What is highest, the Round Tower or a thunderclap?", referring to the size of the former and the sound of the latter. In [[Russian language|Russian]], the phrase ''сравнивать тёплое с мягким'' (to compare warm and soft) is used. In [[Argentina]], a common question is ''¿En qué se parecen el amor y el ojo del hacha?'' (What do love and the eye of an axe have in common?) and emphasizes dissimilarity between two subjects; in [[Colombia]], a similar (though more rude) version is common: ''confundir la mierda con la pomada'' (to confuse shit with ointment). In Polish, the expression ''co ma piernik do wiatraka?'' is used, meaning "What has (is) gingerbread to a windmill?". In Chinese, a phrase that has the similar meaning is 风马牛不相及 (fēng mǎ niú bù xiāng jí), literally meaning "horses and cattles won't mate with each other", and later used to describe things that are totally unrelated and incomparable.

A number of more exaggerated comparisons are sometimes made, in cases in which the speaker believes the two objects being compared are radically different. For example, "oranges with orangutans", "apples with dishwashers", and so on. In English, different fruits, such as pears, plums, or lemons are sometimes substituted for oranges in this context.

Sometimes the two words sound similar, for example, Romanian ''merele cu perele'' (apples and pears) and the Hungarian ''szezont a fazonnal'' (the season with the fashion).

==Published comparisons==
===Scientific===
[[Image:OrangeBloss wb.jpg|thumb|right|Oranges, like apples, grow on trees.]]
At least two [[tongue-in-cheek]] scientific studies have been conducted on the subject, each of which concluded that apples can be compared with oranges fairly easily and on a low budget and the two fruits are quite similar.

The first study, conducted by Scott A. Sandford of the [[NASA Ames Research Center]], used [[infrared spectroscopy]] to analyze both apples and oranges. The study, which was published in the satirical science magazine ''[[Annals of Improbable Research]]'', concluded: "[...] the comparing apples and oranges defense should no longer be considered valid. This is a somewhat startling revelation. It can be anticipated to have a dramatic effect on the strategies used in arguments and discussions in the future."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Scott A.|last=Sandford|url=https://www.improbable.com/airchives/paperair/volume1/v1i3/air-1-3-apples.html|title=Apples and Oranges -- A Comparison|magazine=[[Annals of Improbable Research]]|volume=1|issue=3|date=1995|accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second study, written by [[Stamford Hospital]]'s [[surgeon]]-in-chief James Barone and published in the ''[[British Medical Journal]],'' noted that the phrase ''apples and oranges'' was appearing with increasing frequency in the medical literature, with some notable articles comparing "[[Desflurane]] and [[propofol]]" and "[[Salmeterol]] and [[ipratropium]]" with "apples and oranges". The study also found that both apples and oranges were sweet, similar in size, weight, and shape, that both are grown in [[orchard]]s, and both may be eaten, juiced, and so on. The only significant differences found were in terms of [[seed]]s (the study used seedless oranges), the involvement of [[Johnny Appleseed]], and color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Comparing apples and oranges: a randomised prospective study|first=James E|last=Barone|journal=British Medical Journal|year=2000|volume=321|issue=7276|page=1569|doi=10.1136/bmj.321.7276.1569|pmc=27565|pmid=11124178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Annals of Improbable Research'' subsequently noted that the "earlier investigation was done with more depth, more rigour, and, most importantly, more expensive equipment" than the ''British Medical Journal'' study.&lt;ref name="improbable"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abrahams|first1=Marc|title=Apples and oranges have previously been shown to be remarkably similar|journal=BMJ|date=14 April 2001|volume=322|issue=7291|pages=931|pmc=1120087|pmid=11334040}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic===
On [[April Fools' Day]] 2014, ''[[The Economist]]'' compared worldwide production of apples and oranges from 1983 to 2013, however noted them to be "unrelated variables".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2014/04/daily-chart|title=Daily chart: Comparing apples with oranges|work=The Economist|date=1 April 2014|accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In teaching the use of units==
{{unreferenced-section|date=April 2017}}
While references to comparing apples and oranges are often a [[rhetorical device]], references to adding apples and oranges are made in the case of teaching students the proper uses of [[units of measurement|units]]. Here, the admonition not to "add apples and oranges" refers to the requirement that two quantities with different units may not be combined by addition, although they may always be [[dimensional analysis#Dimensional homogeneity|combined in ratio form by multiplication]], so that multiplying ratios of apples and oranges is allowed. Similarly, the concept of this distinction is often used [[metaphor]]ically in [[elementary algebra]].

The admonition is really more of a [[mnemonic]], since in general counts of objects have no intrinsic unit and, for example, a number count of apples may be dimensionless or have dimension ''fruit''; in either of these two cases, apples and oranges may indeed be added.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6322">[[Image:Immanuel Bekker - Imagines philologorum.jpg|thumb|right|August Immanuel Bekker]]

'''Bekker numbering''' or '''Bekker pagination''' is the standard form of citation to the [[Corpus Aristotelicum|works of Aristotle]].  It is based on the page numbers used in the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] edition of the complete works of [[Aristotle]] and takes its name from the editor of that edition, the classical [[philology|philologist]] [[August Immanuel Bekker]] (1785-1871); because the Academy was located in Berlin, the system is occasionally referred to by the alternative name '''Berlin numbering''' or '''Berlin pagination'''.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristotelis Opera edidit Academia Regia Borussica'', ex recognitione Immanuelis Bekkeri, 5 voll. Berlin,  Georgium Reimerum, 1831-1870 (the last volume contains the ''Index Aristotelicus'' by [[Hermann Bonitz]])&lt;/ref&gt;

Bekker numbers consist of up to three ordered coordinates, or pieces of information: a number, the letter a or b, and another number, which refer respectively to the page number of Bekker's edition of the Greek text of Aristotle's works, the page column (a standard page of Bekker's edition has exactly two columns), and the line number (total lines typically ranging from 20-40 on a given column or page in Bekker's edition).  For example, the Bekker number denoting the beginning of Aristotle's [[Nicomachean Ethics]] is ''1094a1'', which corresponds to page 1094 of Bekker's edition, first column (column a), line 1&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Barnes, ''The Cambridge Companion to Aristotle'', Cambridge 1995 xxi&lt;/ref&gt;.

All modern editions or translations of Aristotle intended for scholarly readers use Bekker numbers, in addition to or instead of page numbers.  Contemporary scholars writing on Aristotle use the Bekker number so that the author's citations can be checked by readers without having to use the same edition or translation that the author used.

While Bekker numbers are the dominant method used to refer to the works of Aristotle, [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] or [[Thomist]] scholars often use the medieval method of reference by book, chapter, and sentence, albeit generally in addition to Bekker numbers.

[[Stephanus pagination]] is the comparable system for referring to the works of [[Plato]], and [[Diels-Kranz numbering]] is the comparable system for [[Pre-Socratic philosophy]].  Unlike Stephanus pagination, which is based upon a three-volume translation of Plato's works and which recycles low page numbers across the three volumes, introducing the possibility for ambiguity if the Platonic work or volume is not specified, Bekker page numbers cycle from 1 through the end of the ''Corpus Aristotelicum'' regardless of volume, without starting over for some other given volume.  Bekker numbering therefore has the advantage that its notation is unambiguous as compact numerical information, although it relies upon the ordering of Aristotle's works as presented in Bekker's edition.

== Aristotle's works by Bekker numbers ==

The following list is complete. The titles are given in accordance with the standard set by the Revised Oxford Translation.&lt;ref&gt;''The Complete Works of Aristotle'', edited by [[Jonathan Barnes]], 2 vols., Princeton University Press, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; Latin titles, still often used by scholars, are also given.

== Aristotelian works lacking Bekker numbers ==

===''Constitution of the Athenians''===
The ''[[Constitution of the Athenians (Aristotle)|Constitution of the Athenians]]'' (or ''Athenaiōn Politeia'') was not included in Bekker's edition because it was first edited in 1891 from papyrus rolls acquired in 1890 by the [[British Museum]].  The standard reference to it is by section (and subsection) numbers.

===Fragments&lt;!--linked from 'Valentin Rose (classicist)'--&gt;===
Surviving fragments of the many lost works of Aristotle were included in the fifth volume of Bekker's edition, edited by [[Valentin Rose (classicist)|Valentin Rose]].  These are not cited by Bekker numbers, however, but according to fragment numbers. Rose's first edition of the fragments of [[Aristotle]] was ''Aristoteles Pseudepigraphus'' (1863).  As the title suggests, Rose considered these all to be spurious. The numeration of the fragments in a revised edition by Rose, published in the [[Teubner]] series, ''[https://archive.org/details/aristotelisquif00arisgoog Aristotelis qui ferebantur librorum fragmenta]'', Leipzig, 1886, is still commonly used (indicated by ''R&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;''), although there is a more current edition with a different numeration by Olof Gigon (published in 1987 as a new vol. 3 in [[Walter de Gruyter]]'s reprint of the Bekker edition), and a new de Gruyter edition by [[Eckart Schütrumpf]] is in preparation.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.colorado.edu/news/releases/2005/12/14/cu-boulder-expert-wins-75000-award-research-aristotle CU-Boulder Expert Wins $75,000 Award For Research On Aristotle,"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418233125/http://www.colorado.edu/news/releases/2005/12/14/cu-boulder-expert-wins-75000-award-research-aristotle |date=2016-04-18 }} University of Colorado Office of News Services, December 14, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

For a selection of the fragments in English translation, see W.D. Ross, ''Select Fragments'' ([https://archive.org/details/worksofaristotle12arisuoft Oxford 1952]), and [[Jonathan Barnes]] (ed.), ''The Complete Works of Aristotle: The Revised Oxford Translation'', vol. 2, Princeton 1984, pp.&amp;nbsp;2384–2465.

The works surviving only in fragments include the dialogues ''On Philosophy'' (or ''On the Good''), ''Eudemus'' (or ''On the Soul''), ''On Justice'', and ''On Good Birth''.  The possibly spurious work, ''[[On Ideas]]'' survives in quotations by [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]] in his commentary on Aristotle's ''Metaphysics''.  For the dialogues, see also the editions of [[Richard Rudolf Walzer]], ''Aristotelis Dialogorum fragmenta, in usum scholarum'' (Florence 1934), and Renato Laurenti, ''Aristotele: I frammenti dei dialoghi'' (2 vols.), Naples: Luigi Loffredo, 1987.

Other show bibles are used as sales documents to help a [[television network]] or [[television studio|studio]] understand a series, and are sometimes given to new writers when they join the writing staff for the same reason.&lt;ref name="Jane"/&gt; These types of bibles discuss the backstories of the main characters and the history of the series' fictional universe.&lt;ref name="Jane"/&gt;

Television series often rely on writers' assistants and [[script coordinator]]s to serve as "walking bibles" in remembering details about a series.&lt;ref name="Jane"/&gt;

[[File:Yearly citation for research paper.png|thumb|Yearly citation c(t) for a research paper from the e Physical Review corpus.]]
'''Citation dynamics''' describes the number of [[references]] received by the [[article (publishing)|article]] or other scientific work over [[time]]. The [[citation]] dynamics is usually described by the bang, that take place 2–3 years after the work has been published, and the burst size spans several [[Order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]]. The presence of bursts is not consistent with other models based on [[preferential attachment]]. Those models are able to account for the skewed citation distribution but their reference accumulation is gradual.&lt;ref name="eom"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Eom|first1=Young-Ho|last2=Fortunato|first2=Santo|title=Characterizing and Modeling Citation Dynamics|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0024926&amp;type=printable|website=journals.plos.org|accessdate=26 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dynamics of scientific production has changed significantly over the past years. Due to [[Technological change|technological progress]], the number of published papers has been increasing exponentially until now. This, along with a much shorter time needed for the article to be published, has affected the [[citation]] dynamics of the modern papers. Furthermore, if the [[reference list]] of the study includes papers published in different years, older papers tend to have more citations. This may not necessarily because they are better but just because they had more time to accumulate those references.

==Model==
It has been found that citation distributions are best described by a shifted [[Power law|power-law]].&lt;ref name='eom'/&gt; The [[probability]] that paper &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is cited at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; after publication as:

: &lt;math&gt; \Pi_{i}(t) = \eta_{i}c_i^tP_{i}(t) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Pi_{i}(t)&lt;/math&gt; serves as the outcome variable for each particular paper &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. Fitness,  &lt;math&gt;\eta_i&lt;/math&gt;, captures the inherent differences between papers, accounting for the perceived [[novelty]] and importance of a discovery. &lt;math&gt;c_i^t&lt;/math&gt; represents the cumulative number of citations acquired by a paper &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_{i}(t)&lt;/math&gt; is a log-normal survival probability.&lt;ref name="Barabasi"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wang|first1=Dashun|last2=Song|first2=Chaoming|last3=Barabási|first3=Albert-László|title=Quantifying Long-Term Scientific Impact|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/342/6154/127.full.pdf|website=science.sciencemag.org|accessdate=18 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The probability is equal

: &lt;math&gt;P_{i}(t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma_it} exp \left \lbrack -\frac{(ln t - \mu_i)^2}{2\sigma_i^2} \right \rbrack &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is time; &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is [[longevity]], capturing the decay rate; and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; indicates immediacy, governing the time for a paper to reach its citation peak.
The ultimate impact &lt;math&gt;c_i^{\infty}&lt;/math&gt; represents the total number or citations that the paper receives during its lifetime.

:  &lt;math&gt;c_i^{\infty} = m(e^{\lambda_i} - 1)&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is a global parameter that has the same value for all publications. &lt;math&gt;\lambda_i&lt;/math&gt; represents the relative fitness of the paper. From the above formula, we can see that the total number of references that the paper can receive during its lifetime depends only on its relative fitness which is very hard to quantify.

The '''Comparative Toxicogenomics Database''' ('''CTD''') is a public website and research tool launched in November 2004 that curates scientific data describing relationships between chemicals/drugs, genes/proteins, diseases, taxa, phenotypes, GO annotations, pathways, and interaction modules.
The database is maintained by the Department of Biological Sciences at [[North Carolina State University]].

==Background==
The Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) is a public website and research tool that curates scientific data describing relationships between chemicals, genes/proteins, diseases, taxa, phenotypes, GO annotations, pathways, and interaction modules, launched on November 12, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mattingly CJ, Rosenstein MC, Colby GT, Forrest JN, Boyer JL |title=The Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD): A Resource for Comparative Toxicological Studies |journal=J Exp Zoolog.

==Goals and objectives==
One of the primary goals of CTD is to advance the understanding of the effects of environmental chemicals on human health on the genetic level, a field called [[toxicogenomics]].

The [[etiology]] of many chronic diseases involves interactions between environmental factors and genes that modulate important physiological processes. Chemicals are an important component of the environment. Conditions such as [[asthma]], cancer, [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], [[hypertension]], [[immunodeficiency]], and [[Parkinson's disease]] are known to be influenced by the environment; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying these correlations are not well understood. CTD may help resolve these mechanisms. The most up-to-date extensive list of peer-reviewed scientific articles about CTD is available at their publications page&lt;ref&gt;[http://ctdbase.org/about/publications/#ctdpubs CTD Publications page] ctdbase.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==Core data==
CTD is a unique resource where [[biocurator]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bourne PE, McEntyre J |title=Biocurators: Contributors to the World of Science |journal=PLoS Comput. Biol. |volume=2 |issue=10 |pages=e142 |date=Oct 2006 |pmid=17411327 |pmc=1626157 |doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020142 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Salimi N, Vita R |title=The Biocurator: Connecting and Enhancing Scientific Data |journal=PLoS Comput. Biol. |volume=2 |issue=10 |pages=e125 |date=Oct 2006 |pmid=17069454 |pmc=1626147 |doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020125 }}&lt;/ref&gt; read the scientific literature and manually curate four types of core data:

* Chemical-gene interactions
* Chemical-disease associations
* Gene-disease associations
* Chemical-phenotype associations

==Data integration==
By integrating the above four data sets, CTD automatically constructs putative chemical-gene-phenotype-disease networks to illuminate molecular mechanisms underlying environmentally-influenced diseases.

These inferred relationships are statistically scored and ranked and can be used by scientists and computational biologists to generate and verify testable hypotheses about toxicogenomic mechanisms and how they relate to human health.

Users can search CTD to explore scientific data for chemicals, genes, diseases, or interactions between any of these three concepts.  Currently,{{when|date=November 2015}} CTD integrates toxicogenomic data for vertebrates and invertebrates.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4986">'''Comparative bullet-lead analysis''' ('''CBLA'''), also known as '''compositional bullet-lead analysis''', is a now discredited and abandoned&lt;ref name=Bohaty /&gt;  [[forensic]] technique which used [[chemistry]] to link [[crime scene]] [[bullet]]s to ones possessed by suspects on the theory that each batch of [[lead]] had a unique elemental makeup.&lt;ref name=solomon&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/17/AR2007111701681.html

The technique was first used after [[U.S. President]] [[John F. Kennedy]]'s [[Kennedy assassination|assassination]] in 1963.&lt;ref name=solomon/&gt;  From the early 1980s through 2004 the US [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] conducted about 2,500 analyses on cases submitted by law-enforcement groups.  The results of these analyses had often been questioned by defence lawyers and the press, so the FBI finally asked the [[United States National Academy of Science]]'s [[Board on Science, Technology, and Economic Policy]] to research the scientific merit of the process.

In 2004 the Board's study was summarized in "Forensic Analysis: Weighing Bullet Lead Evidence."  The Board determined that the chemical analyses were being performed correctly and were probably sufficient to determine correlation between two bullets from separate sources (the analysis used [[Atomic emission spectroscopy|plasma-optical emission spectroscopy]] to identify trace elements in the bullets).  The report also concluded that the seven trace elements selected for the analyses (arsenic, antimony, tin, copper, bismuth, silver and cadmium) are acceptable for sample correlation.  The report finally concluded that the procedure is the best available method for such correlations.  The greatest [[:wikt:caveat|caveat]] in the report was that the [[Statistics|statistical]] tests as applied by the FBI could cause confusion and misinterpretation when transmitted to prosecutors or when explained to a trial jury.  Because of the significance of this weakness, the report concluded that the analysis should be used with caution.  This report helped the FBI decide in 2004 to voluntarily cease offering the analysis to law-enforcement entities. The National Academy of Sciences never required that the FBI stop using the test.&lt;ref name=solomon/&gt;

''CNN PRESENTS Encore Presentation: Reasonable Doubt'' examined the unreliability of this technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=CNN PRESENTS-Encore Presentation: ''Reasonable Doubt''| url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0605/07/cp.01.html | publisher=CNN | date=Aired May 7, 2006| accessdate=May 31, 2013| format=transcript}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been discontinued as of September 1, 2005.&lt;ref name="FBI Press Release"&gt;{{cite press release| title=FBI Laboratory Announces Discontinuation of Bullet Lead Examinations| url=https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/fbi-laboratory-announces-discontinuation-of-bullet-lead-examinations| publisher=FBI National Press Office| date=September 1, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[U.S. government]] has fought releasing the list of the estimated 2,500 cases over three decades in which it performed the analysis, which may have led to [[false conviction]]s. According to the FBI, only 20% of the 2,500 tests performed introduced the CBLA results into evidence at trial.&lt;ref name="FBI Press Release" /&gt;

On 17 December 2008, Jimmy Ates was released from a Florida prison after serving ten years on the conviction of having murdered his wife, a conviction obtained largely on the strength of a bullet-lead analysis.  His conviction was overturned as a consequence of the 2004 report.&lt;ref name=Bohaty&gt;{{cite journal| last=Bohaty| first=Rochelle F.

{{neuropsychology}}
'''Comparative neuropsychology''' refers to an approach used for understanding human [[brain]] functions. It involves the direct evaluation of clinical neurological populations by employing experimental methods originally developed for use with nonhuman animals.

Over many decades of animal research, methods were perfected to study the effects of well-defined brain [[lesion]]s on specific behaviors, and later the tasks were modified for human use.  Generally the modifications involve changing the reward from food to money, but standard administration of the tasks in humans still involves minimal instructions, thus necessitating a degree of [[procedural memory|procedural learning]] in human and nonhuman animals alike.

Currently, comparative neuropsychology is used with neurological patients to link specific deficits with localized areas of the brain.

The comparative neuropsychological approach employs simple tasks that can be mastered without relying upon language skills.  Precisely because these simple paradigms do not require linguistic strategies for solution, they are especially useful for working with patients whose language skills are compromised, or whose cognitive skills may be minimal.

Comparative neuropsychology contrasts with the traditional approach of using tasks that rely upon linguistic skills, and that were designed to study human cognition.  Because important ambiguities about its heuristic value had not been addressed empirically, only recently has comparative neuropsychology become popular for implementation with [[brain damage|brain-damaged]] patients.

Within the past decade, comparative neuropsychology has had prevalent use as a framework for comparing and contrasting the performances of disparate neurobehavioral populations on similar tasks.

==History==

Comparative neuropsychology involves the study of brain-behavior relationships by applying experimental paradigms, used extensively in animal laboratories, for testing human clinical populations.&lt;ref name="m"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oscar-Berman|first1=M|title=A comparative neuropsychological approach to alcoholism and the brain.|journal=Alcohol and Alcoholism Supplement|date=1994|volume=2|pages=281–9|pmid=8974348}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popular paradigms include delayed reaction tasks, discrimination and reversal learning tasks, and matching- and nonmatching-to-sample.&lt;ref name="m"/&gt; These tasks are used to test animals and relate them to human brain functioning. Such tasks were perfected on experimental animals having well defined brain lesions, and adapted for human neurological patients.&lt;ref name="m"/&gt; The comparative aspects of such approach resides in the analogy between animals with brain lesions and human patients with lesions in homologous areas of the brain. One example is represented by the comparison between the brain of laboratory animals (primarily non human primates and mice) with the one of people with damages resulting from alcohol abuse.

==George Ettlinger==

George Ettlinger was one of the few who actively combined human and animal research, and he did so consistently throughout his scientific career.&lt;ref&gt;Milner, A. D. (1998). Introduction: Comparative Neuropsychology. Chicago: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Ettinger work focused on the importance of the inferior temporal neocortex in visual discrimination learning and memory in macaque monkeys,&lt;ref name="cowey"&gt;Cowey, A., Dean, P., &amp; Weiskrantz, L. (1998). Ettlinger at Bay: can visual agnosia be explained by low-level visual impairments? Chicago: Oxford University Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt; and on the importance of ventral temporal lobe in vision. Ettinger animals models carried inferotemporal or latero-ventral prestriate [[Ablative brain surgery|ablation]]. In 1966 George Ettlinger, together with the psychologist [[Colin Blakemore]] and the neurosurgeon Murray Falconer, described the results of a study on correlation between pre-operative intelligence and the severity of mesial temporal sclerosis in temporal lobe specimens excised to treat intractable epilepsy.&lt;ref name="oxbury" /&gt; Such study It is known as a forerunner of what has become one of the potentially most interesting techniques for exploring the relationship between certain aspects of human memory and temporal lobe structures.&lt;ref name="oxbury"&gt;Oxbury, J. M., &amp; Oxbury, S. (1998). Memory and the human temporal lobes. Chicago: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14426">'''Comparative physiology''' is a [[List of academic disciplines|subdiscipline]] of [[physiology]] that studies and exploits the diversity of functional characteristics of various kinds of [[organisms]].  It is closely related to [[evolutionary physiology]] and [[environmental physiology]].  Many universities offer undergraduate courses that cover comparative aspects of animal physiology. According to [[Clifford Ladd Prosser]], "Comparative Physiology
is not so much a defined discipline as a viewpoint, a philosophy."&lt;ref name="Prosser1975"/&gt;

==History==
Originally, [[physiology]] focused primarily on human beings, in large part from a desire to improve [[medical]] practices.  When physiologists first began comparing different [[species]] it was sometimes out of simple curiosity to understand how organisms work but also stemmed from a desire to discover basic physiological principles.  This use of specific organisms convenient to study specific questions is known as the [[Krogh Principle]].

==Methodology==
C. Ladd Prosser,&lt;ref name='Greenbergetal1975'&gt;{{cite journal|last=Greenberg|first=M. J. |author2=P. W. Hochachka |author3=C. P. Mangum |year=1975|title=Biographical data:  Clifford Ladd Prosser| url=|journal=Journal of Experimental Zoology|issn=|volume=194|issue=1|pages=5–12|doi=10.1002/jez.1401940102|pmid=1104756}}&lt;/ref&gt; a founder of modern comparative physiology, outlined a broad agenda for comparative physiology in his 1950 edited volume (see summary and discussion in [[Theodore Garland, Jr.|Garland]] and Carter&lt;ref name="GarlandCarter1994"/&gt;):

1.  To describe how different kinds of animals meet their needs.
:This amounts to cataloging functional aspects of biological diversity, and has recently been criticized as "stamp collecting" with the suggestion that the field should move beyond that initial, exploratory phase.&lt;ref name='MangumHochachka1998'&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mangum|first=C. P.|author2=P. W. Hochachka|year=1998|title=New directions in comparative physiology and biochemistry: mechanisms, adaptations, and evolution| url=|journal=Physiological Zoology|issn=|volume=71|issue=5|pages=471–484|doi=|pmid=9754524}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2.  The use of physiological information to reconstruct	[[phylogenetic]] relationships of organisms.&lt;br /&gt;
:In principle physiological information could be used just as morphological information or [[DNA]] sequence is used to measure evolutionary divergence of organisms.  In practice, this has rarely been done, for at least four reasons:
:* physiology doesn't leave many [[fossil]] cues,
:* it can't be measured on [[museum]] specimens,
:* it is difficult to quantify as compared with morphology or DNA sequences, and
:* physiology is more likely to be adaptive than DNA, and so subject to parallel and [[convergent evolution]], which confuses phylogenetic reconstruction.

3.  To elucidate how physiology mediates interactions between organisms and their environments.
:This is essentially [[physiological ecology]] or ecological physiology.

4.  To identify "model systems" for studying particular physiological functions.
:Examples of this include using squid giant axons to understand general principles of nerve transmission, using rattlesnake tail shaker muscles for measurement of in vivo changes in metabolites (because the whole animal can be put in an NMR machine),&lt;ref name='Conley_Lindstedt_1996'&gt;{{cite journal|last=Conley|first=K. E.|author2=S. L. Lindstedt|year=1996|title=Rattlesnake tail-shaking: minimal cost per twitch in striated muscle| url=|journal=Nature|issn=|volume=383|pmid=8779716|issue=6595|pages=71–73|doi=10.1038/383071a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the use of ectothermic poikilotherms to study effects of temperature on physiology.

5.  To use the "kind of animal" as an experimental variable.
: "While other branches of physiology use such variables as light, temperature, oxygen tension, and hormone balance, comparative physiology uses, in addition, species or animal type as a variable for each function." &lt;ref name='prosser1950'&gt;Prosser (1950, p. 1)&lt;/ref&gt;
: 25 years later, Prosser put things this way: "I like to think of it as that method in physiology which uses kind of organism as one experimental variable."&lt;ref name='Prosser1975'&gt;{{cite journal|last=Prosser|first=C. L.|year=1975|title=Prospects for comparative physiology and biochemistry| url=|journal=Journal of Experimental Zoology|issn=|volume=194|pmid=1194870|issue=1|pages=345–348|doi=10.1002/jez.1401940122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparative physiologists often study organisms that live in "extreme" [[Natural environment|environments]] (e.g., deserts) because they expect to find especially clear examples of evolutionary adaptation.&lt;ref name='GarlandCarter1994'&gt;{{cite journal|last= [[Theodore Garland, Jr.|Garland]] |first=T., Jr.|author2=P. A. Carter|year=1994|title=Evolutionary physiology| url=http://www.biology.ucr.edu/people/faculty/Garland/GarlCa94.pdf|journal=Annual Review of Physiology|issn=|volume=56|issue=|pages=579–621|doi=10.1146/annurev.ph.56.030194.003051|pmid= 8010752}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One example is the study of water balance in desert-inhabiting mammals, which have been found to exhibit kidney specializations.&lt;ref name='Al-kahtani_et_al_2004'&gt;{{cite journal|last=Al-kahtani|first=M.A. |author2=C. Zuleta |author3=E. Caviedes-Vidal |author4=[[Theodore Garland, Jr|T. Garland, Jr.]] |year=2004|title=Kidney mass and relative medullary thickness of rodents in relation to habitat, body size, and phylogeny| url=http://www.biology.ucr.edu/people/faculty/Garland/Al-kahtaniEA2004.pdf|journal=Physiological and Biochemical Zoology |issn=|volume=77|issue=3|pages=346–365|doi=10.1086/420941|pmid=15286910}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, comparative physiologists have been attracted to "unusual" organisms, such as very large or small ones.  As an example, of the latter, [[hummingbirds]] have been studied.  As another example, [[giraffe]] have been studied because of their long necks and the expectation that this would lead to specializations related to the regulation of [[blood pressure]].  More generally, [[ectothermic]] [[vertebrates]] have been studied to determine how [[blood]] [[acid-base balance]] and [[pH]] change as [[body temperature]] changes.

==Funding==
In the United States, research in comparative physiology is funded by both the [[National Institutes of Health]] and the [[National Science Foundation]].

[[Knut Schmidt-Nielsen]] (1915–2007) was a major figure in vertebrate comparative physiology, serving on the faculty at [[Duke University]] for many years and training a large number of students [https://web.archive.org/web/20070210060243/http://www.dukenews.duke.edu/2007/01/schmidt-nielsen.html (obituary)].  He also authored several books, including an influential text, all known for their accessible writing style.

[[Grover C. Stephens]]  (1925–2003) was a well-known invertebrate comparative physiologist, serving on the faculty of the [[University of Minnesota]] until becoming the founding chairman of the Department of Organismic Biology at the [[University of California at Irvine]] in 1964.  He was the mentor for numerous graduate students, many of whom have gone on to further build the field [http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/senate/inmemoriam/GroverC.Stephens.htm (obituary)].  He authored several books and in addition to being an accomplished biologist was also an accomplished pianist and philosopher.

{{Grammatical categories}}
'''Comparison''' is a feature in the [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] or [[syntax (linguistics)|syntax]] of some [[language]]s, whereby [[adjective]]s and [[adverb]]s are [[inflection|inflected]] or modified to indicate the relative degree of the property defined by the adjective or adverb. The [[comparative]] expresses a comparison between two (or more) entities or groups of entities in quality, quantity, or degree; the '''superlative''' is the form of an adverb or adjective that is the greatest degree of a given descriptor.

The [[grammatical category]] associated with comparison of adjectives and adverbs is '''degree of comparison'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Huddleston|first1=Rodney|last2=Pullum|first2=Geoffrey|year=2002|title=The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language|pages=1099–1170}}&lt;/ref&gt; The usual degrees of comparison are the ''positive'', which simply denotes a property (as with the [[English grammar|English]] words ''big'' and ''fully'');  the ''comparative'', which indicates ''great'''er''''' degree (as ''bigger'' and ''more fully''); and the ''superlative'', which indicates ''great'''est''''' degree (as ''biggest'' and ''most fully'').&lt;ref&gt;Tom McArthur, ed. (1992) ''The Oxford Companion to the English Language'', Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-214183-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some languages have forms indicating a very large degree of a particular quality (called [[Elative (gradation)|elative]] in Semitic linguistics). Other languages (e.g. English) can express lesser degree, e.g. ''beautiful'', ''less beautiful'', ''least beautiful''.

The comparative is frequently associated with adjectives and adverbs because these words take the ''-er'' suffix or modifying word ''more'' or ''less'' (e.g., ''fast&lt;u&gt;er&lt;/u&gt;'', ''&lt;u&gt;more&lt;/u&gt; intelligent'', ''&lt;u&gt;less&lt;/u&gt; wasteful''); it can also, however, appear  when no adjective or adverb is present, for instance with nouns (e.g., ''more men than women''). One [[preposition]], ''near'', also has a superlative form, as in ''Find the restaurant nearest your house''.

==Formation of comparatives and superlatives==
Comparatives and superlatives may be formed [[morphology (linguistics)|morphologically]], by inflection, as with the English and [[German grammar|German]] ''-er'' and ''-(e)st'' forms, or [[syntax|syntactically]], as with the English ''more...'' and ''most...'' and the [[French grammar|French]] ''plus...'' and ''le plus...'' forms. Common adjectives and adverbs often produce irregular forms, such as ''better'' and ''best'' (from ''good'') and ''less'' and ''least'' (from ''little/few'') in English, and ''meilleur'' (from ''bon'') and ''mieux'' (from the adverb ''bien'') in French.

==Comparative and superlative constructions==
Most if not all languages have some means of forming the comparative, although these means can vary significantly from one language to the next.

Comparatives are often used with a [[conjunction (grammar)|conjunction]] or other grammatical means to indicate with what the comparison is being made, as with ''than'' in English, ''als'' in German, etc. In [[Russian grammar|Russian]] and Greek ([[Ancient Greek grammar|Ancient]], [[Koine Greek grammar|Koine]] and [[Modern Greek grammar|Modern]]) this can be done by placing the compared noun in the [[genitive]] case. With superlatives, the class of things being considered for comparison may be indicated, as in "the best swimmer out of all the girls".

Languages also possess other structures for comparing adjectives and adverbs; English examples include "as... as" and "less/least...".

А few languages apply comparison to nouns and even verbs. One such language is [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], where expressions like "по&amp;#x300; човек (po chovek), най човек (nay chovek), по-малко човек (po malko chovek)" (literally ''more person'', ''most person'', ''less person'' but normally ''better kind of a person'', ''best kind of person'', ''not that good kind of a person'') and "по&amp;#x300; обичам (po obicham), най-малко обичам (nay malko obicham)" (''I like more'', ''I like the least'') are quite usual.&lt;ref&gt;Comparatives in Bulgarian are formed with the particles по and най, separated with the following adjective or adverb with a hyphen. If they are applied to a noun or a verb, they are written as separate words with a grave accent over по ''po''. Comparatives in [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] are formed identically but written as one word, Macedonian) (both meaning ''better'')&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage when considering only two things==

In many languages, including English, traditional grammar requires the comparative form to be used when exactly two things are being considered, even in constructions where the superlative would be used when considering a larger number. For instance, "May the better man win" would be considered correct if there are only two individuals competing. However, this rule is not always observed in informal usage; the form "May the best man win" will often be used in that situation, as it would if there were three or more competitors involved.&lt;ref name=GrammarGirl /&gt;

==Rhetorical use of unbalanced comparatives==

In some contexts, such as advertising or political speeches, absolute and relative comparatives are intentionally employed in a way that invites a comparison, and yet the basis of comparison is not established. This is a common [[rhetorical]] device used to create an implication of significance where one may not actually be present. Although such usage is common, it is sometimes [[Linguistic prescription|considered ungrammatical]].&lt;ref name=GrammarGirl&gt;{{cite web |url=http://grammar.quickanddirtytips.com/comparatives-versus-superlatives.aspx |title=Comparatives Versus Superlatives |first=Bonnie |last=Trenga |date=12 August 2008 |work=Grammar Girl |publisher=Quick and Dirty Tips}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example:
* Always!
* Why pay more?
* We work harder.
* We sell for less!
* More doctors recommend it.

==English==
English has two parallel systems of comparison, a morphological one formed using the suffixes ''-er'' (the "comparative") and ''-est'' (the "superlative"), with some irregular forms; and a syntactic one, formed with the adverbs "more" and "most".

As a general rule, words with one [[syllable]] require the suffix (except for the four words: fun, real, right, wrong), words with three or more syllables require "more" or "most", and words with two syllables may use one system or the other; which words use which system is a matter of idiom. Some adjectives, ''e.g.'' 'polite', can use either form, with different frequencies according to context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/archive/papers/kytorom.html |title=Competing forms of adjective comparison in modern English: What could be more quicker and easier and more effective? |first1=Merja |last1=Kytö |first2=Suzanne |last2=Romaine |date=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Morphological comparison===

Morphological comparison uses the [[suffix]]es ''-er'' (the "comparative") and ''-est'' (the "superlative"). These inflections are of [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] origin and are [[cognate]] with the [[Latin]] suffixes -''ior'' and -''issimus'' and Ancient Greek -''īōn'' and -''istos''. They are typically added to shorter words, words of [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] origin, and borrowed words which have been fully assimilated into the English vocabulary. Usually the words which take these [[inflection]]s have fewer than three syllables.

This system also contains a number of irregular forms, some of which, like "good", "better", and "best", contain [[suppletion|suppletive]] forms. These irregular forms include:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Positive !! Comparative !! Superlative
|-
| good || rowspan="2" | better || rowspan="2" | best
|-
| well
|-
| bad, evil || rowspan="2" | worse || rowspan="2" | worst
|-
| ill
|-
| rowspan="2" | far || farther || farthest
|-
| further || furthest
|-
| little || less(er) || least
|-
| many, much || more || most
|}

===Syntactic comparison===
The second system of comparison in English appends the [[grammatical particle]]s "more" and "most", themselves the irregular comparatives of "many" and  "much", to the adjective or adverb being modified. This series can be compared to a system containing the [[diminutive]]s "less" and "least".

This system is most commonly used with words of French or Latin derivation; with adjectives and adverbs formed with suffixes other than ''-ly'' (e.g., "beautiful"); and with longer, technical, or infrequently used words. For example:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Positive !! Comparative !! Superlative
|-
| beautiful || more beautiful || most beautiful
|}

===Absolute adjectives===
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2015}}

Some adjectives, the [[ungradable adjective|absolute or ungradable adjectives]] do not appear to logically allow degrees. Some qualities are either ''present'' or ''absent'', such as being Cretaceous or igneous, so it appears illogical to call anything "very Cretaceous", or to characterize something as "more igneous" than something else.

Some grammarians object to the use of the superlative or comparative with words such as ''full'', ''complete'', ''unique'', or ''empty'', which by definition already denote either a totality, an absence, or an absolute.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, such words are routinely and frequently qualified in contemporary speech and writing. This type of usage conveys more of a [[Literal and figurative language|figurative]] than a literal meaning, because in a strictly literal sense, something cannot be more or less unique or empty to a greater or lesser degree.

Many [[prescriptive grammar]]s and [[English usage|style guides]] include adjectives for inherently superlative qualities to be ungradable. Thus, they reject expressions such as ''more perfect'', ''most unique'', and ''most parallel'' as illogical [[pleonasm]]s: after all, if something is unique, it is one of a kind, so nothing can be "very unique", or "more unique" than something else.

Other style guides argue that terms like ''perfect'' and ''parallel'' never apply ''exactly'' to things in real life, so they are commonly used to mean ''nearly perfect'', ''nearly parallel'', and so on; in this sense, ''more perfect'' (''i.e.'', more nearly perfect, closer to perfect) and ''more parallel'' (''i.e.'', more nearly parallel, closer to parallel) are meaningful.

==Balto-Slavic languages==
In most [[Balto-Slavic languages]] (such as Czech, Polish, Lithuanian and Latvian), the comparative and superlative forms are also declinable adjectives.

In [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], comparative and superlative forms are formed with the clitics ''по-'' (''more'') and ''най-'' (''most''):
:''голям'' (''big'')
:''по-голям'' (''bigger'')
:''най-голям'' (''biggest'')

In [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]] and [[Slovenian language|Slovene]], comparative is formed from the base form of an adjective with a suffix and superlative is formed with a circumfix (equivalent to adding a prefix to the comparative).
:''mladý'' / ''młody'' / ''mladý'' / '' mlad'' (''young'')
:''mladší'' / ''młodszy'' / ''mladší'' / '' mlajši'' (''younger'')
:''nejmladší'' / ''najmłodszy'' / ''najmladší'' / '' najmlajši '' (''youngest'')

In [[Russian language|Russian]], comparative and superlative forms are usually formed with a suffix:
:''добрый'' (''kind'')
:''добрее'' (''kinder'')
:''добрейший'' (''kindest'')

==Romance languages==
In contrast to English, the relative and the superlative are joined into the same degree (the superlative), which can be of two kinds: comparative (e.g. "the most beautiful") and absolute (e.g. "very beautiful").

[[French language|French]]: The superlative is created from the comparative by inserting the definitive article (la, le, or les), or the possessive article (''mon'', ''ton'', ''son'', etc.), before "plus" or "moins" and the adjective determining the noun. For instance: ''Elle est la plus belle femme'' → (she is the most beautiful woman); ''Cette ville est la moins chère de France'' → (this town is the least expensive in France); ''C'est sa plus belle robe'' → (It is her most beautiful dress). It can also be created with the suffix "-issime" but only with certain words, for example: "C'est un homme richissime" → (That is the most rich man). Its use is often rare and ironic.

[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Italian language|Italian]] distinguish comparative superlative ''(superlativo relativo)'' and absolute superlative ''(superlativo absoluto/assoluto).
For the comparative superlative they use the words "mais" and "più" between the article and the adjective, like "most" in English.
For the absolute superlative they either use "muito"/"molto" and the adjective or modify the adjective by taking away the final vowel and adding ''issimo'' (singular masculine), ''issima'' (singular feminine), ''íssimos''/''issimi'' (plural masculine), or ''íssimas''/''issime'' (plural feminine). For example:
*''Aquele avião é velocíssimo''/''Quell'aeroplano è velocissimo'' → That airplane is very fast
There are some irregular forms for some words ending in "-re" and "-le" (deriving from Latin words ending in "-er" and "-ilis") that have a superlative form similar to the Latin one. In the first case words lose the ending "-re" and they gain the endings ''errimo'' (singular masculine), ''errima'' (singular feminine), ''érrimos''/''errimi'' (plural masculine), or ''érrimas''/''errime'' (plural feminine); in the second case words lose the "-l"/"-le" ending and gain ''ílimo''/''illimo'' (singular masculine), ''ílima''/''illima'' (singular feminine), ''ílimos''/''illimi'' (plural masculine), or ''íli
[[Romanian language|Romanian]], similar to Portuguese and Italian, distinguishes comparative and absolute superlatives. The comparative uses the word "mai" before the adjective, which operates like "more" or "-er" in English. For example: ''luminos'' → bright, ''mai luminos'' → brighter. To weaken the adjective, the word "puțin" (little) is added between "mai" and the adjective, for example ''mai puțin luminos'' → less bright. For absolute superlatives, the gender-dependent determinant "cel" precedes "mai," conjugated as "cel / cei" for male singular / plural and "cea / cele" for female singular / plural. For example: ''cea mai luminoasă stea'' → the brightest star; ''cele mai frumoase fete'' → the most beautiful girls; ''cel mai mic morcov'' → the smallest carrot.

==Celtic languages==
[[Scottish Gaelic language|Scottish Gaelic]]: When comparing one entity to another in the present or the future tense, the adjective is changed by adding an ''e'' to the end and ''i'' before the final consonant(s) if the final vowel is broad. Then, the adjective is preceded by "nas" to say "more," and ''as'' to say "most." (The word ''na'' is used to mean ''than''.) Adjectives that begin with ''f'' are lenited.  and ''as'' use different syntax constructions. For example:
Tha mi nas àirde na mo pheathraichean.'' → I am taller than my sisters.
Is mi as àirde.'' → I am the tallest.

As in English, some forms are irregular, i.e. nas fheàrr (better), nas miosa (worse), etc.

In other tenses, ''nas'' is replaced by ''na bu'' and ''as'' by ''a bu,'' both of which [[Lenition|lenite]] the adjective if possible. If the adjective begins with a vowel or an ''f'' followed by a vowel, the word ''bu'' is reduced to ''b'''. For example:

*''Bha mi na b' àirde na mo pheathraichean.'' → I was taller than my sisters.
*''B' e mi a b' àirde.'' → I was the tallest.

[[Welsh Language|Welsh]] is similar to English in many respects.  The ending ''-af'' is added onto regular adjectives in a similar manner to the English ''-est'', and with (most) long words ''mwyaf'' precedes it, as in the English ''most''.  Also, many of the most common adjectives are irregular.  Unlike English, however, when comparing just two things, the superlative ''must'' be used, e.g. of two people - ''John ydy'r talaf'' (John is the tallest).

==Akkadian==
[[Image:AmarnaLetterOfMarriageNegotiation-BritishMuseum-August19-08.jpg|right|240px|thumb|[[Amarna letter EA 19]], Para 2, (last line): "...the Gods and (our Kingly relations), forever"..."''may it be'', (one verb, (5 signs, e-le-[[ni (cuneiform)|né]]-ep-pi)), ''I-n-t-e-r-R-e-l-a-t-e-d''-!." &lt;br&gt;(The first sign "e" is rubbed off; only a space-(depression) locates it.)-(high resolution expandible photo)]]
In [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] [[cuneiform]], (on a 12 paragraph [[clay tablet]]), from the [[time period]] of the 1350 BC [[Amarna letters]] (a roughly 20-year [[text corpus|body]] of letters), two striking examples of the superlative extend the common grammatical use. The first is the numeral "10," as well as "7 and 7." The second is a verb-spacement adjustment.

The term [[Amarna letters-phrases and quotations#7 times and 7 times again|"7 and 7"]] means 'over and over'. The phrase itself is a superlative, but an addition to some of the Amarna letters adds "more" at the end of the phrase (EA 283, ''Oh to see the King-(pharaoh)):'' ''"... I fall at the feet of the king, my lord. I fall at the feet of the king, my lord, 7 and 7 times'' '''''more,''''' ''...."''.&lt;ref name=Moran&gt;{{citation
|last = Moran
|first = William L.
|authorlink=William L. Moran
|origyear = 1987|year = 1992
|title = The Amarna Letters
|url = https://www.amazon.com/Amarna-Letters-William-L-Moran/dp/0801867150#reader_0801867150

}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|323–324}} The word 'more' is Akkadian ''mila'', and by Moran is 'more' or 'overflowing'. The meaning in its letter context is "...over and over again, overflowing," (as 'gushingly', or 'obsequiously', as an underling of the king).

The numeral 10 is used for ''ten times greater'' in EA 19, ''Love and Gold'', one of King [[Tushratta]]'s eleven letters to the Pharaoh-([[Amenhotep IV]]-''[[Akhenaton]]''). The following quote using 10, also closes out the small paragraph by the second example of the superlative, where the verb that ends the last sentence is spread across the letter in s-p-a-c-i-n-g, to accentuate the last sentence, and the verb itself (i.e. the relational kingly topic of the paragraph):

:''".... Now, in keeping with our constant and mutual love, you have made it'' '''10''' ''times greater than the love shown my father. May the gods grant it, and may [[Teshub|Teššup]], my lord, and [[Amun|Aman]] make'' flourish ''for evermore, just as it is now, this mutual love of ours.''&lt;ref name="Moran" /&gt;{{rp|42–46}}

The actual last paragraph line contains three words: 'may it be', 'flourish', and 'us'. The verb flourish (from napāhu?, ''to light up, to rise''), uses: -e-le-[[ni (cuneiform)|né]]-ep-pi-, and the spaces. The other two words on the line, are made from two characters, and then one: ''"...may it be, flourish-our (relations)."''

==Estonian==
In Estonian, the superlative form can usually be formed in two ways. One is a periphrastic construction with ''kõige'' followed by the comparative form. This form exists for all adjectives. For example: the comparative form of ''sinine'' 'blue' is ''sinisem'' and therefore the periphrastic superlative form is ''kõige sinisem''. There is also a synthetic ("short") superlative form, which is formed by adding ''-m'' to the end of the plural partitive case. For ''sinine'' the plural partitive form is ''siniseid'' and so ''siniseim'' is the short superlative. The short superlative does not exist for all adjectives and, in contrast to the ''kõige''-form, has a lot of exceptions.

''[[Star Trek]]'' and ''[[Star Wars]]'' are American [[media franchise]]s which present alternative scenarios of space adventure. The two franchises are dominant in this setting of storytelling and have offered various forms of media productions for decades that manage billions of dollars of [[intellectual property]], providing employment and [[entertainment]] for billions of people around the world.&lt;ref name="HC"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=130035|title=Trekkers VS Lucasites|date=May 14, 1999|author=Richard Ho|work=[[The Harvard Crimson]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{expand section|date=June 2014}}
''Star Trek'' was introduced as [[Star Trek: The Original Series|a live-action television series]] in 1966 that lasted three years. ''[[Star Trek: The Animated Series]]'' commenced in 1973 (based directly on the original series) but lasted only two seasons with a combined total of 22 episodes.&lt;ref name="Forbeck2011"&gt;{{cite book|first=Matt |last=Forbeck|title=Star Wars vs. Star Trek: Could the Empire kick the Federation's ass?

''Star Wars'' was introduced as a feature film, ''[[A New Hope (film)|A New Hope]]'' (1977). A novelization titled ''[[Star Wars: From the Adventures of Luke Skywalker]]'', based on the original script of the film, was published about a year earlier. Upon the release of the first film, ''Star Wars'' quickly grew into a popular media franchise.&lt;ref name="Forbeck2011"/&gt;

==Differences==
''Star Trek'' debuted in television. The franchise was conceived in the style of the television Western ''[[Wagon Train]]'' and the adventure stories of [[Horatio Hornblower]], but evolved into an idealistic, [[utopia]]n prospect of future human society. Inspired by ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'',&lt;ref name="Simon1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Keller Simon|title=Trash Culture: Popular Culture and the Great Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tOtvQHj1AdIC&amp;pg=PA139|date=23 November 1999|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-92442-0|pages=139–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark Clark|title=Star Trek FAQ: Everything Left to Know About the First Voyages of the Starship Enterprise|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s_lxVMh_5xwC&amp;pg=PT22|date=1 April 2012|publisher=Applause Theatre &amp; Cinema Books|isbn=978-1-55783-963-3|pages=22–}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Star Trek''{{'}}s main focus is of space exploration and a galactic society consisting of multiple planets and species, where conflict occasionally occurs. ''Star Trek'' occurs in the relatively distant future, specifically the 22nd through 24th centuries, with occasional [[Time travel in fiction|time travel]] and [[Multiverse|interdimensional travel]]. The [[Earth in science fiction|Earth of the ''Star Trek'']] universe shares most of its history with the real world.

''Star Wars'' debuted in film, despite the novel based on the film's original script having been published a year before the film itself. ''Star Wars'' mainly belongs to the [[space opera]] [[subgenre]] of science fiction that follows [[The Hero's Journey]]&lt;ref&gt;Clive Williams, The Hero’s Journey: A Mudmap for Change, Journal of Humanistic Psychology, (002216781770549), (2017).
Crossref&lt;/ref&gt; and was inspired by works such as [[Beowulf]], [[King Arthur]]&lt;ref name=Dreams&gt;''[[Empire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy]]''. ''Star Wars'' Trilogy Box Set DVD documentary. [2005]&lt;/ref&gt; and other mythologies, world religions, as well as ancient and medieval history.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lucasfilm|title=Star Wars and History|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=m81Bg4E_y_IC}}|date=15 October 2012|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-1-118-28525-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It depicts a galactic society in constant conflict. Though there are periods of peace, these are only documented in novels, comics, video games, non-feature films and other spin-off media. ''Star Wars'' is set "a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away", although many characters are human, occasionally use [[Earth]] metaphors and exhibit human character traits.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Although both ''Star Trek'' and ''Star Wars'' populate various forms of media, not all types have been produced that are mutual to both franchises. ''Star Wars'' has not produced any live-action television series while ''Star Trek'' has produced seven live-action television series.

''Star Trek'' likewise has not produced any [[television film]]s; whereas ''Star Wars'' has produced at least three live-action television films outside the ''Star Wars'' film saga. The ''[[Star Wars Holiday Special]]'', ''[[Ewoks: Caravan of Courage]]'' and ''[[Ewoks: Battle for Endor]]'' are all live-action television spin-off films set in the ''Star Wars'' universe, but not considered part of the official ''[[Star Wars expanded universe|Star Wars canon]]''.

===Runtime===
* ~513 hours (''Star Trek'' television) + ~25 hours (''Star Trek'' films)
* ~84 hours (''Star Wars'' films) + ''Star Wars'' canon series + expanded universe films and TV productions.

==Similarities and commonalities==
Aside from both having the word ''star'' in their titles, the two franchises share many similarities and commonalities. Both franchises have their origins in the [[space western]] subgenre.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Both stories depict societies consisting of multiple planets and species. The main galaxy in ''Star Trek'' consists of various planets, each inhabited by different species, united into a single state, the [[United Federation of Planets]]. ''Star Wars'' depicts a galaxy that is mostly part of a single state known as the [[Galactic Republic|Old Republic]], inhabited by humans and countless other species, which later became the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]] and was again later reformed into a new society called the [[New Republic (Star Wars)|New Republic]] after a series of wars.

Both franchises promote philosophical and political messages.

The primary philosophies of ''Star Trek'' convey the morals of exploration and interference and how to properly confront and ethically resolve a new situation. Creator [[Gene Roddenberry]] was inspired by [[morality play|morality tales]] such as ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]''.&lt;ref name="Simon1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark2012"/&gt;

The primary philosophical messages of ''Star Wars'' are the ethics of good against evil and how to distinguish them from one another.&lt;ref name="Decker2010"&gt;{{cite book|first=Kevin S. |last=Decker|title=Star Wars and Philosophy: More Powerful Than You Can Possibly Imagine|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=pDMRdxLocsUC}}|date=1 October 2010|publisher=ReadHowYouWant.com|isbn=978-1-4596-0101-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Star Wars'' preaches against [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] systems and favors societies that offer equality.&lt;ref name="Redmond2004"&gt;{{cite book|first=Sean |last=Redmond|title=Liquid Metal: The Science Fiction Film Reader|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=ha5O_0BCCrgC|page=303}}|year=2004|publisher=Wallflower Press|isbn=978-1-903364-87-1|pages=303–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview on the ''Star Wars'' 20th Anniversary UK Programme aired in 1997 referring to the mythology of the original ''Star Wars'' trilogy, [[Patrick Stewart]] stated "A belief in one's own powers; especially one's own powers to do good because the underlying morality of ''Star Wars'' is a very very positive one."

There have been actors from both franchises who have appeared on common television series such as ''[[The Outer Limits (1995 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'' and ''Seaquest''.

Both franchises also derive significantly from history and ancient mythology, including [[Classical mythology|Greco-Roman mythology]]. Many planets and alien species in ''Star Trek'', for instance, are named after ancient Roman deities. Several episodes from various ''Star Trek'' television series, such as "[[Who Mourns for Adonais]]", are directly based on ancient Greek-Roman themes and settings.&lt;ref name="Kapell2010"&gt;{{cite book|first=Matthew Wilhelm |last=Kapell|title=Star Trek as Myth: Essays on Symbol and Archetype at the Final Frontier|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=hWS7v3pGynUC}}|date=1 March 2010|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-5594-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series also make references to [[Babylon|Ancient Babylon]] and its [[Babylonian religion|mythic folklore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ksarchive.com/viewstory.php?sid=4899|title=Star Trek as Myth Through an Analysis of the Similarities and Differences Between the Gilgamesh/Enkidu and Kirk/Spock Relationships|publisher=The Kirk/Spock fanfiction archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Klingon]]s and their warrior culture are a representation of the 12th-century [[Mongols]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transparencynow.com/startrek/startrek1.htm|title=Star Trek And the New Myth of the Machine as Seen in the Talosians, Trelane, and the Organians|work=Ken Sanes|publisher=Transperancy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of ''Star Wars''{{'}} story plots and character developments are based on ancient history, including [[Classical antiquity|classical Greece and Rome]], such as the fall of the [[Galactic Republic|Old Republic]] in ''Star Wars'', followed by the rise of the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]], which parallels the fall of the ancient [[Roman Republic]] followed by the rise of the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref name="auto3" /&gt;

A 1983 documentary on the making of ''[[Return of the Jedi|Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi]]'' was hosted by [[Leonard Nimoy]], who also made mention of Lucas's original plan to do two other trilogies preceding and proceeding the original trilogy.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.blastr.com/2014-2-20/leonard-nimoy-hosts-1983-return-jedi-set-visit-awesome-long-lost-clip|title=Leonard Nimoy hosts 1983 Return of the Jedi set visit in this awesome, long-lost clip|work=Trent Moore|publisher=SyFyWire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Abrams era ===
[[J. J. Abrams]], director and producer of ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' (2009) and ''[[Star Trek Into Darkness]]'' (2013) and producer of ''[[Star Trek Beyond]]'' (2016), directed and produced ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]'' (2015). ''Star Trek'' (2009) and ''Star Wars: The Force Awakens'' (2015) are each the first entries in expected trilogies. These films received favorable critical and commercial response and revived interest for both franchises. In addition to Abrams, actors such as [[Simon Pegg]] starred in both series.

''[[Star Trek: Nemesis]]'' (2002) was poorly received and ''[[Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith]]'' (2005) had capped off the prequel trilogy, which overall had a mixed to positive reception.

The newer films of the two franchises filmed major scenes in the [[United Arab Emirates]]. The desert scenes on the planet Jakku in ''Star Wars: The Force Awakens'' (2015) were filmed in the Emirate of [[Abu Dhabi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2016/01/star-wars-abu-dhabi-the-worthy-zinzana-rattle-the-cage-justice-1201677541/|title=Star Wars: The Force Awakens Helps Abu Dhabi Build Road To Somewhere - Deadline|author=Ali Jaafar|work=Deadline}}&lt;/ref&gt; while scenes for cities in the film ''Star Trek Beyond'' (2016) were filmed in the Emirate of [[Dubai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emirates247.com/entertainment/star-trek-beyond-descends-on-dubai-jlt-difc-raided-2015-10-13-1.606444|title='Star Trek Beyond' descends on Dubai: JLT, DIFC 'raided'|work=Emirates 24-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two franchises now offer almost all forms of media ranging from novels, television series, comic books, toys for younger audience, magazines, themed merchandise, board games and video games, as well as fan works. These include [[Canon (fiction)|canonical]] and non-canonical works, including works made both by series producers and fans jointly.

==Estimated financial comparisons==
Despite the difference in the numbers of films, the profit made by the ''Star Wars'' film series exceed the profit of the ''Star Trek'' film series by almost five times, while the entire franchise outgrosses the other by four times. It is difficult to accurately judge the total worth of each franchise as television series, memorabilia and video games must be taken into account.

==Critique and commentaries==
Science fiction writer [[David Brin]] criticized ''Star Wars'' at the time of the release of ''The Phantom Menace'', arguing that while the ''Star Wars'' movies provide special effects and action/adventure, audiences are not encouraged to engage with their overriding themes. Among his issues with ''Star Wars'' and George Lucas, whom he accused of "having an agenda", is that the ''Star Wars'' galaxy is too "elitist", with arbitrary rulers on both the evil and good sides, replacing one another without any involvement of the population. He criticizes both sides of the [[Galactic Civil War]] as part of the "same genetically superior royal family".&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/1999/06/15/brin_main/|title="Star Wars" despots vs. "Star Trek" populists|first=David|last=Brin|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He finds the ''Star Wars'' universe flawed with additional forms of absolutism, such as justified emotions leading a good person to evil - for example citing the idea that [[Luke Skywalker]] killing [[Palpatine]] would somehow turn him to the dark side, despite the act potentially saving millions of lives.&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt;

Among the many other flaws he sees with ''Star Wars'' is that [[Anakin Skywalker]] becomes a hero in the ending of ''Return of the Jedi'' simply because he saved his son's life, while the atrocities he committed during his time in power go largely ignored. In contrast, he argues that, despite its flaws, ''Star Trek'' is "democratic" and follows genuine issues and strong questioning.&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt;

[[William Shatner]] argues that ''Star Trek'' is superior to ''Star Wars''. According to him, "''Star Trek'' had relationships and conflict among the relationships and stories that involved humanity and philosophical questions."&lt;ref name="auto2" /&gt; Shatner believes that ''Star Wars'' was only better than ''Star Trek'' in terms of special effects, and that once J.J. Abrams became involved, ''Star Trek'' was able to "supersede ''Star Wars'' on every level".&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/09/15/william-shatner-star-trek-star-wars_n_964530.html|title=William Shatner: 'Star Wars Is Derivative Of Star Trek'|first1=Gazelle Emami Deputy Features|last1=Editor|first2=The Huffington|last2=Post|date=15 September 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tim Russ]], who played [[Tuvok]] on ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'', claims that it is difficult to find common enough elements to be able to compare the two. Among those common elements are their similar settings of unique characters and technologies. He echoed Shatner that ''Star Trek'' reflects common human issues, the morals of exploration and considers ethical questions. ''Star Wars'' in his view is a classic medieval tale dressed up as action-adventure, and that embraces the [[Eastern philosophy]] of inner-strength. Russ concludes that despite both their success and popularity, ''Star Trek'' comes out as the better of the two, as it is set in "our" galaxy and therefore people can relate better to it, whereas ''Star Wars'' takes place in another galaxy. He acknowledged that he could be biased.&lt;ref name="Forbeck2011"/&gt;

[[Jeremy Bulloch]] is best known for his role as [[Boba Fett]] in the original ''Star Wars'' trilogy. He is a huge fan of ''Star Trek: The Original Series''. He argued that while both franchises are popular, ''Star Wars'' comes out as the superior, for its soundtracks and special effects.&lt;ref name="Forbeck2011"/&gt;

Contrasting the focus of the two franchises, contributor J.C. Herzthe of ''[[The New York Times]]'' argued, "''Trek'' fandom revolves around technology because the ''Star Trek'' universe was founded on ham-fisted dialogue and ''Gong Show''-caliber acting. But the fictional science has always been brilliant. [[Physics and Star Wars|The science in ''Star Wars'']] is nonsense, and everyone knows it. But no one cares because ''Star Wars'' isn't about science. It's epic drama. It's about those incredibly well-developed characters and the moral decisions they face. People don't get into debates about how the second [[Death Star]] works. They get into debates about the ethics of blowing it up."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/29/technology/game-theory-star-wars-world-with-a-sense-of-humor.html|title='Star Wars' World With a Sense of Humor|date=29 October 1998|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Wenzel of ''[[The Denver Post]]'' highlighted two differences in approach, noting the "swashbuckling" and "gunslinger" style of ''Star Wars'' compared with ''Star Trek''{{'}}s "broader themes of utopian living, justice and identity" and that the spiritual aspect of ''Star Wars'' contrasts with the balance of emotion and logic seen in ''Star Trek''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denverpost.com/entertainment/ci_13518101|title="Star Wars" vs. "Star Trek": The final frontier of marketing is an expanding universe|author=John Wenzel|date=11 October 2009|publisher=The Denver Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Billionaire [[Peter Thiel]] told Dowd "I'm a capitalist. ''Star Wars'' is the capitalist show. ''Star Trek'' is the communist one". He further stated "There is no money in ''Star Trek'' because you just have the transporter machine that can make anything you need. The whole plot of ''Star Wars'' starts with [[Han Solo]] having this debt that he owes and so the plot in ''Star Wars'' is driven by money."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thewrap.com/peter-thiel-star-trek-communist-star-wars-capitalist/|title=Peter Thiel Thinks 'Star Trek' Is 'Communist' While 'Star Wars' Is 'Capitalist'|date=11 January 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archived footage in ''[[Trek Nation]]'' showed [[Gene Roddenberry]] saying, "I like ''Star Wars''. It was young King Arthur growing up, slaying the evil emperor finally. There's nothing wrong with that kind of entertainment - everything doesn't have to create a philosophy for you - for your whole life. You can also have fun."&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;[[Trek Nation]] [2010 documentary]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences on each other==
{{see also|Star Wars sources and analogues}} 
The two franchises have a "symbiotic relationship" stated Shatner, who credits ''Star Wars'' for launching the [[Star Trek (film series)|''Star Trek'' films]].&lt;ref name="dominguez19990517"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/1999-05-17/entertainment/18105136_1_star-trek-memories-william-shatner-convention-speaker | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112134840/http://articles.nydailynews.com/1999-05-17/entertainment/18105136_1_star-trek-memories-william-shatner-convention-speaker | archivedate=2012-01-12 | title=William Shatner's Trek Never Ends The Actor-author Keeps Seeking New Challenges While Feeding Fans' Hunger For All Things Kirk | work=New York Daily News | date=1999-05-17 | accessdate=October 14, 2011 | author=Dominguez, Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt; He repeated this sentiment at a 2016 ''Star Trek'' fan convention in [[Las Vegas]] by stating "''Star Wars'' created ''Star Trek''". He clarified this statement by explaining that at the time of the release of the first ''Star Wars'' film (''A New Hope''), Paramount, then under new management, was struggling to come up with something that could compete with it. A ''Star Trek'' relaunch was the choice. Since then, public interest has returned to ''Star Trek''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comicbook.com/2016/08/07/william-shatner-says-star-wars-created-star-trek/|title=William Shatner Says Star Wars Created Star Trek|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "It was ''Star Wars'' that thrust ''Star Trek'' into the people of Paramount's consciousness" Shatner stated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2016/08/06/media/william-shatner-star-wars-star-trek/index.html|title=Captain Kirk thanks Star Wars!|first=Jose|last=Pagliery|date=6 August 2016|website=CNNMoney}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2016/08/07/star-trek-star-wars-shatner/|title=William Shatner: 'Star Trek' owes a big thanks to 'Star Wars'|first=Adam|last=Rosenberg|website=Mashable}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The documentary ''[[Trek Nation]]'' features interviews where both Lucas and Roddenberry praise each other's respective franchises, with the former stating that ''Star Trek'' was an influence while writing the original screenplay for ''Star Wars''.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt; He explained that while both franchises were so "far out", ''Star Trek'' produced a fanbase that "softened up the entertainment arena" so that ''Star Wars'' could "come along and stand on its shoulders."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/star-wars/26348/george-lucas-on-how-star-trek-helped-star-wars|title=George Lucas on how Star Trek helped Star Wars|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also acknowledged by Shatner, who went as far as to call ''Star Wars'' a "derivative" of ''Star Trek''.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

A few references to ''Star Wars'' have been inserted into ''Star Trek'' films. For fleeting moments, one can see ships and droids from ''Star Wars'' in both ''Star Trek'' (2009) and ''Star Trek Into Darkness'' (2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/sep/10/star-wars-r2d2-star-trek-into-darkness|title=Star Wars droid R2D2 spotted in Star Trek Into Darkness|last=Child|first=Ben|date=2013-09-10|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some ''Star Trek'' films and television episodes used the ''Star Wars'' animation shop, [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]], for their special effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ilm.com/archive/|title=Archive|newspaper=Industrial Light &amp; Magic|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Roddenberry was honored at a ''Star Trek'' convention late in life, a congratulatory letter from Lucas was presented by an actor dressed as [[Darth Vader]]. A few years earlier, Roddenberry had contributed an entry in honor of ''Star Wars'' and Lucas at a convention honoring the latter.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==Comic relief==
William Shatner was a presenter at Lucas' [[American Film Institute]] Lifetime Achievement Award ceremony in 2007 and did a comical stage performance honoring Lucas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanfilm.afi.com/issue/2013/4/film-exclusive|title=Shatner Honors Lucas|publisher=American Film Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a live concert, Shatner dressed as an [[Stormtrooper (Star Wars)|imperial stormtrooper]] singing "[[Girl Crush]]" alongside [[Carrie Underwood]] and [[Brad Paisley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6753087/william-shatner-star-wars-stormtrooper-girl-crush-cmas|title=William Shatner Dresses as 'Star Wars' Stormtrooper, Sings 'Girl Crush' at CMAs|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Shatner and [[Carrie Fisher]] posted a series of humorous YouTube videos [[satire|satirizing]] each other's franchises.

In a 2016 interview, Shatner commented that [[James T. Kirk|Captain Kirk]] and [[Princess Leia]] eloping and running off into the sunset would be the "perfect union" between ''Star Trek'' and ''Star Wars''.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

Shatner has also posted a number of humorous tweets on his [[Twitter]] account mocking ''Star Wars''. Amongst them were commemorating the 35th anniversary of the poorly received ''Star Wars Holiday Special''. It was then that ''Star Wars'' actor [[Peter Mayhew]] posted a "retaliation" tweet congratulating Shatner for the directing of ''[[Star Trek V: The Final Frontier]]'', another poorly received film.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/2017/03/22/william-shatner-cant-stop-trolling-star-wars-fans/|title=William Shatner can't stop trolling Star Wars fans|publisher=The Telegraph}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future==
Both franchises are set to grow throughout the next decade.

''Star Trek'' was rebooted with a series of feature films starting with the [[Star Trek (film)|''Star Trek'' reboot]] (2009), which was followed by ''[[Star Trek Into Darkness]]'' (2013) and ''[[Star Trek Beyond]]'' (2016) and a number of sequels are set to follow. A new television series based in the original timeline, subtitled ''[[Star Trek: Discovery|Discovery]]'', serving as a prequel to the original series, debuted on [[CBS All Access]], an online streaming platform, in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.startrek.com/article/new-star-trek-series-premieres-january-2017|title=Star Trek New Star Trek Series Premieres January 2017|work=StarTrek.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Star Wars'' picked up from where ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' left off, with ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens|The Force Awakens]]'' the first in the new trilogy, and ''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi|The Last Jedi]]'' following two years later. Additionally, more spin-off media is also underway after the debut of ''[[Star Wars Rebels]]'', a television series set in between the ''Star Wars'' prequels and the original trilogy, and an anthology of stand-alone ''Star Wars'' films, starting with ''[[Rogue One]]'', which was released in December 2016, and ''[[Solo: A Star Wars Story|Solo]]'' following in May 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Upcoming-Star-Wars-Movies-List-Titles-Release-Dates-100467.html|title=Upcoming Star Wars Movies: List Of Titles And Release Dates - CINEMABLEND|date=2015-12-16|newspaper=CINEMABLEND|access-date=2016-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fan works===
{{further|Star Trek fan productions|Star Wars fan films}}
Aside from official works by the producers of ''Star Trek'' and ''Star Wars'', many [[fan film]]s and [[webisode]]s set in the two universes of the franchises are also constantly produced and posted on the Internet by fans, but are not officially considered [[canon (fiction)|canon]] in relation to either franchise.

Professional wrestling could be considered a [[performance art]] which combines [[Athletics (physical culture)|athletics]] with [[Performing arts|theatrical performance]].&lt;ref name="Barthes"&gt;{{cite web|last=Barthes|first=Roland|title=The World Of Wrestling |work=Mythologies |year=1957 |url=http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/~ikalmar/illustex/Barthes-wrestling.htm |accessdate=2008-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matches are contested on a pre-determined basis, where the fight on display is merely for entertainment purposes. Viewers are integral to a professional wrestling match, as the audience is who the action is for. Professional wrestling mixes many styles of [[amateur wrestling]], striking and showmanship to display a fight, whilst the two performers work together to achieve a "worked" fight. Professional wrestling was first popularized in the 19th century [[Europe]] as a carnival attraction.

Mixed Martial Arts, is a hybrid of many types of physical full-contact sports; including [[wrestling]], [[boxing]] and [[Martial Arts]], such as [[Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu]]. The early 1990s saw the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] popularize the term "Mixed Martial Arts", for such a bout. Competitors in MMA are generally skilled in many different styles, however, it is possible to be only proficient in one type of combat. As some professional wrestling moves are simply worked versions of legitimate holds, there can be a crossover between the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://uproxx.com/prowrestling/mma-dragon-sleeper-finish-video/ | title=An MMA Fighter Won A Fight With A Shoot Dragon Sleeper | work=Uproxx.com | date=November 12, 2017 | accessdate=January 3, 2018 | author=Hanstock, Bill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rivalry===
Since MMA's rise to prominence in the 1990s, some pro wrestlers or MMA fighters have been cynical against the other's profession. This can be an attack on the sport as a whole, or acting as a fan dismissing certain actions within that sport.&lt;ref name="BloodyElbow"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2017/12/18/16793536/ufc-daniel-cormier-disses-pro-wrestling-spots-gets-into-twitter-beef-with-cody-rhodes-mma-news | title=Daniel Cormier disses pro wrestling spots, gets into Twitter beef with Cody Rhodes | publisher=Bloody Elbow Magazine | date=Dec 18, 2017 | accessdate=January 3, 2018 | author=Burke, Tim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Antarctic expedition map (Amundsen - Scott)-en-crop.png|thumb|300px|alt= Map of a segment of Antarctica, identifying the polar marches of Scott and Amundsen.|The routes to the South Pole taken by Scott (green) and Amundsen (red), 1911–1912.]]

Between December 1911 and January 1912, both [[Roald Amundsen]] (leading his [[Amundsen's South Pole expedition|South Pole expedition]]) and [[Robert Falcon Scott]] (leading the [[Terra Nova Expedition]]) reached the [[South Pole]] within a month of each other. But while Scott and his four companions died on the return journey, Amundsen's party managed to reach the [[geographic south pole]] first and subsequently return to their base camp at [[Framheim]] without loss of life, suggesting that they were better prepared for the expedition. The contrasting fates of the two teams seeking the same prize at the same time invites comparison.

== Overview ==
The outcomes of the two expeditions were as follows.
*Priority at the South Pole: Amundsen beat Scott to the South Pole by 34 days.
*Fatalities: Scott lost five men including himself returning from the pole, out of a team of 65. Amundsen's entire team of 19 returned to Norway safely.
*Some authors (including Huntford and Fiennes) associate up to two further deaths (the drowning of Robert Brissenden and the suicide of [[Hjalmar Johansen]]) with the two expeditions, but these happened outside the Antarctic Circle.

Historically, several factors have been discussed and many contributing factors claimed,&lt;ref name="Sullivan" /&gt; including:

* Priority at the pole: Scott wrote that Amundsen's dogs seriously threatened his own polar aspirations, because dogs, being more cold-tolerant than ponies, would be able to start earlier in the season than Scott's mixed transport of dogs, ponies, and motors.&lt;ref&gt;Scott's diary, 22 Feb 1911 "The proper, as well as wiser, course for us is to proceed exactly as though this had not happened. To go forward and do our best for the honour of the country without fear or panic. There is no doubt that Amundsen's plan is a serious menace to ours. He has a shorter distance to the Pole by 60 miles— I never thought he could have got so many dogs safely to the ice. His plan for running them seems excellent. But above all he can start his journey early in the season—an impossible condition with ponies."&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cherry Garrard in ''[[The Worst Journey in the World]]'' agreed but added that in his experience, dogs would not have been able to ascend the Beardmore Glacier.&lt;ref&gt;Apsley Cherry Garrard, ''The Worst Journey in the World'', chapter 19 "The practical man of the world has plenty of criticism of the way things were done. He says dogs should have been taken [to the Polar Plateau], but he does not show how they could have been got up and down the Beardmore [Glacier]."&lt;/ref&gt;
* With regards to the causes of the deaths of Scott and his companions, Cherry-Garrard devotes chapter 19 in his book to examine the causes. Among several other factors, he surmised that [[#Food and fuel|the rations of Scott's team were inadequate]] and did not provide enough energy for the men.&lt;ref name="Apsley Cherry Gerrard 1921, page 573"&gt;Apsley Cherry-Garrard, The Worst Journey in the World&amp;nbsp;– Antarctic 1910–13, Chapter XIX, page 573.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Much of Scott's hauling was to be done by ponies, which are ill-suited to work on snow and ice without snow-shoes. Their relatively small hooves and large weight caused them to sink into anything other than very firm snow or ice. Oates was opposed to snow-shoes and had left most of them at base camp.
* Ponies' coats easily became soaked with [[perspiration]] during exertion, thus necessitating constant attention with blankets to avoid hypothermia through evaporation. Dogs in contrast do not have sweat glands—they cool themselves via panting, making them less vulnerable to the cold. With ponies, Scott acknowledged he could not depart until 1 November 1911 when the weather would be warmer, leaving him less time to complete the journey.
* The loss of ponies, several of which had drowned on disintegrating sea-ice, limited the supplies that could be hauled to the depots. Of 19 ponies brought south to aid in laying depots on the Ross Ice Shelf (traversed during the first and final quarters of the trek) nine were lost before the journey began. Further, unlike dogs which could eat the abundant [[Seal meat|seal]] and penguin meat found in Antarctica, the ponies' food had to be carried forward from the ship, vastly increasing the stores that had to be transported as Scott's expedition moved towards the pole.  
* Had the one-ton depot been placed at latitude 80°&amp;nbsp;S., as planned, Scott and his two surviving companions could have reached it on their return march. Instead, because Scott refused to drive the ponies to their deaths, despite Oates' urgent advice to do so, the depot was placed some 31&amp;nbsp;miles short of there. Scott's party died  11&amp;nbsp;miles south of the depot.
* The last-minute addition of Lieutenant Henry R. Bowers to the planned four-man pole party may have strained the rationing plan, although the death of Petty Officer Evans weeks later reduced the party to four again.
* The rations were deficient in B and C vitamins.&lt;ref name=Preston&gt;{{cite book|last= Preston|first= Diana|title= A First Rate Tragedy|publisher= Constable &amp; Co.|location= London|year= 1997|pages= 218–219|isbn= 0-09-479530-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party became weaker a few weeks after reaching the pole, despite Scott's racing ambitions before the return march, writing "Now for a desperate struggle to get the news through first [before Amundsen reaches the cablehead in Australia]. I wonder if we can do it."
* The tins of cooking fuel cached along the return route were found to be partly empty, which forced the men to eat frozen food. Shortage of fuel to melt water likely caused the men to become dehydrated. Apparently the heat of the sun had vaporised part of the fuel, enabling it to escape past the cork stoppers. Amundsen knew about this "creep", and had had the fuel tins soldered shut on the voyage to Antarctica, see below.
* The weather on the return march seems to have been unusually bad. In particular, when the party reached the Great Ice Barrier, the temperature was much lower than expected for the season, making the surface much less suitable for the sledge runners. Furthermore, the tailwind which they had expected to aid them home did not appear. Scott wrote, in his final "Message to the Public": "...our wreck is certainly due to this sudden advent of severe weather...."
* The complexity of the transportation plan made it vulnerable. It depended in part on motor-sledges, ponies, dogs, and southerly winds to assist the sledges (which were fitted with sails). Half of the distance was intended to be covered by man-hauling (and sails whenever conditions permitted). Scott's daily marches were limited to the endurance of the slowest team, the man-haulers who were instructed to advance 15 miles a day. The ponies marched by night and rested when the sun was warmer, Meares remained idle in camp with the much faster dogs for many hours, before catching up at the end of the day.&lt;ref&gt;E.G.R.G. Evans South With Scott. Collins London 1953 p184&lt;/ref&gt; 
Sullivan states that it was the last factor that probably was decisive.&lt;ref name="Sullivan" /&gt; he states "Man is a poor [[pack animal|beast of burden]], as was shown in the terrible experience of Scott, Shackleton, and Wilson in their thrust to the south of 1902–3. However, Scott relied chiefly on man-hauling in 1911–12 because ponies could not ascend the glacier midway to the Pole. The Norwegians correctly estimated that dog teams could go all the way. Furthermore, they used a simple plan, based on their native skill with skis and on dog-driving methods that were tried and true. In a similar fashion to the way the moon was reached by expending a succession of rocket stages and then casting each aside; the Norwegians used the same strategy, sacrificing the weaker animals along the journey to feed the other animals and the men themselves."&lt;ref name="Sullivan" /&gt;

== Objectives of the expeditions ==
Scott and his financial backers saw the expedition as having a scientific basis, while also wishing to reach the pole. However, it was recognised by all involved that the South Pole was the primary objective ("The Southern Journey involves the most important object of the Expedition"&amp;nbsp;– Scott), and had priority in terms of resources, such as the best ponies and all the dogs and motor sledges as well as involvement of the vast majority of the expedition personnel. Scott and his team knew the expedition would be judged on his attainment of the pole ("The ... public will gauge the result of the scientific work of the expedition largely in accordance with the success or failure of the main object"&amp;nbsp;– Scott). He was prepared to make a second attempt the following year (1912–13) if this attempt failed and had Indian Army mules and additional dogs delivered in anticipation. In fact the mules were used by the team that discovered the dead bodies of Scott, [[Henry Robertson Bowers]], and [[Edward Adrian Wilson]] in November 1912, but proved even less useful than the ponies, according to [[Cherry-Garrard]].

Amundsen's expedition was planned to reach the South Pole. This was a plan he conceived in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;The South Pole, Roald Amundsen, {{ISBN|1-85065-469-7}}, Volume I, Chapter II, page 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Amundsen's expedition did conduct geographical work under [[Kristian Prestrud]] who conducted an expedition to [[King Edward VII Land]] while Amundsen was undertaking his attempt at the pole.

== Base camps ==
Amundsen camped on the [[Ross Ice Shelf]] at the [[Bay of Whales]] which is 60&amp;nbsp;miles (96&amp;nbsp;km) closer to the pole than Scott's camp (which was 350&amp;nbsp;miles west of Amundsen). Amundsen had deduced that, as the Trans-Antarctic Mountains ran northwest to southeast then if he were to meet a mountain range on his route then the time spent at the high altitude of the Antarctic plateau would be less than Scott's.&lt;ref&gt;The South Pole, Roald Amundsen, {{ISBN|1-85065-469-7}}, Volume I, Chapter II, page 47.&lt;/ref&gt;
Scott's base was at [[Cape Evans]] on [[Ross Island]], with access to the Trans-Antarctic mountain range to the west, and was a better base for geological exploration. He had based his previous expedition in the same area. However, he knew it to be poor as a route to the pole as he had to start before sea ice melted and had suffered delay in returning while waiting for the sea ice to freeze. They also had to make detours around Ross Island and its known crevassed areas which meant a longer journey. The crossing of the Ross Ice Shelf was an onerous task for the ponies. Scott had advanced considerable stores across the ice shelf the year before to allow the ponies to carry lighter loads over the early passage across the ice. Even so, he had to delay the departure of the ponies until 1 November rather than 24 October when the dogs and motor sledges set off.&lt;ref&gt;E.R.G.R, Evans South With Scott Collins London 1953 p153&lt;/ref&gt;
Consequently, the Motor Party spent 6 days at the Mount Hooper Depot waiting for Scott to arrive.&lt;ref&gt;E.R.G.R, Evans South With Scott Collins London 1953 p184&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods of transport ==
=== Motor sledges ===
The major comparison between Scott and Amundsen has focused on the choice of draft transport&amp;nbsp;—dog versus pony/man-hauling. In fact Scott took dogs, ponies and three "motor sledges". Scott spent nearly seven times the amount of money on his motor sledges than on the dogs and horses combined. They were therefore a vital part of the expedition. Unfortunately, Scott decided to leave behind the engineer, Lieutenant Commander [[Reginald William Skelton]]&lt;ref name="Capt Scott 1910"&gt;Letter to Capt Scott, R W Skelton, 7 April 1910.&lt;/ref&gt; who had created and trialled the motor sledges. This was due to the selection of Lieutenant [[Edward Evans, 1st Baron Mountevans|E.R.G.R. "Teddy" Evans]] as the expedition's second in command. As Evans was junior in rank to Skelton, he insisted that Skelton could not come on the expedition.&lt;ref name="Capt Scott 1910" /&gt; Scott agreed to this request and Skelton's experience and knowledge was lost.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to R W Skelton from Capt Scott, 21 March 1910.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the original three motor sledges was a failure even before the expedition set out; the heavy sledge was lost through thin ice on unloading it from the ship. The two remaining motor sledges failed relatively early in the main expedition because of repeated faults. Skelton's experience might have been valuable in overcoming the failures.&lt;ref&gt;Scott's Last Expedition, entry 17 Oct 1911, page 335 as an example.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ponies vs dogs ===
Scott had used dogs on his first ([[Discovery Expedition|Discovery]]) expedition and felt they had failed. On that journey, Scott, Shackleton, and Wilson started with three sledges and 13 dogs. But on that expedition, the men had not properly understood how to travel on snow with the use of dogs. The party had skis but were too inexperienced to make good use of them.&lt;ref name="Pugh" /&gt; As a result, the dogs travelled so fast that the men could not keep up with them. The Discovery expedition had to increase their loads to slow the dogs down.&lt;ref name="Pugh" /&gt; Additionally, the dogs were fed Norwegian dried fish, which did not agree with them and soon they began to deteriorate.&lt;ref name="Pugh" /&gt; The whole team of dogs eventually died (and were eaten), and the men took over hauling the sleds.&lt;ref name="Pugh" /&gt;

Scott's opinion was reinforced by Shackleton's experience on his [[Nimrod expedition]] that got to within {{convert|97.5|nmi|km mi}} of the pole. Shackleton used ponies. Scott planned to use ponies only to the base of the [[Beardmore Glacier]] (one-quarter of the total journey) and man-haul the rest of the journey. Scott's team had developed snow shoes for his ponies, and trials showed they could significantly increase daily progress. However, [[Lawrence Oates]], whom Scott had made responsible for the ponies, was reluctant to use the snow shoes and Scott failed to insist on their use.&lt;ref name="Solomon-2001"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Solomon|first1=Susan|title=The Coldest March: Scott`s Fatal Antarctic Expedition|date=2001|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|isbn=0300089678|edition=Hardcover|url=https://www.amazon.com/Coldest-March-Scott-s-Antarctic-Expedition/dp/0300089678/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1479764466&amp;sr=1-1|accessdate=21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|85}}

There was plenty of evidence that dogs could succeed in the achievements of [[William Speirs Bruce]] in his Arctic, Antarctic, and [[Scottish National Antarctic Expedition]], Amundsen in the ''[[Gjøa]]'' [[North West passage]] expedition, [[Fridtjof Nansen]]'s crossing of [[Greenland]], [[Robert Peary]]'s three attempts at the [[North Pole]], [[Eivind Astrup]]'s work supporting Peary, [[Frederick Cook]]'s discredited North Pole expedition, and [[Otto Sverdrup]]'s explorations of [[Ellesmere Island]]. Moreover, Scott ignored the direct advice he received (while attending trials of the motor sledges in Norway) from Nansen, the most famous explorer of the day, who told Scott to take "dogs, dogs and more dogs".&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Sir Clements Markham from Fridtjof Nansen, 4 April 1913.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the events, the expert view in England had been that dogs were of dubious value as a means of Antarctic transport.&lt;ref name="Murray"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Murray | first = Carl | date = October 2008 | title = The use and abuse of dogs on Scott's and Amundsen's South Pole expeditions | journal = The Polar Record | publisher = Cambridge University Press | volume = 44 | issue = 4 | pages = 303–311 | issn = 0032-2474 | doi=10.1017/s0032247408007493}}&lt;/ref&gt; Broadly speaking, Scott saw two ways in which dogs may be used—they may be taken with the idea of bringing them all back safe and sound, or they may be treated as pawns in the game, from which the best value is to be got regardless of their lives.&lt;ref name="Murray" /&gt; He stated that if, and only if, the comparison was made with a dog sledge journey which aimed to preserve the dogs' lives, 'I am inclined to state my belief that in the polar regions properly organised parties of men will perform as extended journeys as teams of dogs.'&lt;ref name="Murray" /&gt; On the other hand, if the lives of the dogs were to be sacrificed, then 'the dog-team is invested with a capacity for work which is beyond the emulation of men. To appreciate this is a matter of simple arithmetic'.&lt;ref name="Murray" /&gt; But efficiency notwithstanding, he expressed "reluctance" to use dogs in this way: "One cannot calmly contemplate the murder of animals which possess such intelligence and individuality, which have frequently such endearing qualities, and which very possibly one has learnt to regard as friends and companions."&lt;ref name="Murray" /&gt;

Amundsen, by contrast, took an entirely utilitarian approach.&lt;ref name="Murray" /&gt; Amundsen planned from the start to have weaker animals killed to feed the other animals and the men themselves.&lt;ref name="Sullivan"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Sullivan | first = Walter | year = 1962 | title = The South Pole Fifty Years After | url=http://arctic.journalhosting.ucalgary.ca/arctic/index.php/arctic/article/view/3571/3546|journal = Arctic | volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = 175–178 | doi=10.14430/arctic3571}}&lt;/ref&gt; He expressed the opinion that it was less cruel to feed and work dogs correctly before shooting them, than it would be to starve and overwork them to the point of collapse.&lt;ref name="Pugh"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Pugh | first = L G | title = The Logistics of the Polar Journeys of Scott, Shackleton and Amundsen | date = January 1972 | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society of Medicine | volume = 65 | issue = 1 | pages = 42–47 | pmid = 4552519 | pmc=1644311 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Amundsen and his team had similar affection for their dogs as those expressed above by the English, but they "also had agreed to shrink from nothing in order to achieve our goal".&lt;ref&gt;The South Pole, Roald Amundsen, {{ISBN|1-85065-469-7}}, Volume II, Chapter XI, page 62-63.&lt;/ref&gt; The British thought such a procedure was distasteful, though they were willing to eat their ponies.&lt;ref name="Sullivan" /&gt;

Amundsen had used the opportunity of learning from the [[Inuit]] while on his ''[[Gjøa]]'' [[North West passage]] expedition of 1905. He recruited experienced dog drivers. To make the most of the dogs he paced them and deliberately kept daily mileages shorter than he need have for 75 percent of the journey,&lt;ref&gt;Diary, Olav Bjaaland, entry 12 November 1911.&lt;/ref&gt; and his team spent up to 16 hours a day resting. His dogs could eat seals and penguins hunted in the [[Antarctic]] while Scott's pony fodder had to be brought all the way from England in their ship. It has been later shown that seal meat with the blubber attached is the ideal food for a sledge dog. Amundsen went with 52 dogs, and came back with 11.&lt;ref name="Pugh" /&gt;

What Scott did not realise is a sledge dog, if it is to do the same work as a man, will require the same amount of food.&lt;ref name="Pugh" /&gt; Furthermore, when sledge dogs are given insufficient food they become difficult to handle.&lt;ref name="Pugh" /&gt; The advantage of the sledge dog is its greater mobility.&lt;ref name="Pugh" /&gt; Not only were the Norwegians accustomed to skiing, which enabled them to keep up with their dogs, but they also understood how to feed them and not overwork them.&lt;ref name="Pugh" /&gt;

=== Walking vs skiing on snow ===
Scott took the Norwegian [[pilot (aeronautics)|pilot]] and [[skier]] [[Tryggve Gran]] to the [[Antarctic]] on the recommendation of Nansen to train his expedition to ski, but although a few of his party began to learn, he made no arrangements for compulsory training for the full party. Gran (possibly because he was Norwegian) was not included in the South Pole party, which could have made a difference. Gran was, one year later, the first to locate the deceased Scott and his remaining companions in their tent just some 18&amp;nbsp;km (11 miles) short of One Ton depot, that might have saved their lives had they reached it.

Scott would subsequently complain in his diary, while well into his journey and therefore too late to take any corrective action and after over 10 years since the Discovery expedition, that "Skis are the thing, and here are my tiresome fellow countrymen too prejudiced to have prepared themselves for the event".&lt;ref&gt;Scott's Last Expedition, entry 11 Dec 1911, page 388.&lt;/ref&gt;

Amundsen on his side recruited a team of well experienced skiers, all Norwegians who had skied from an early age. He also recruited a champion skier, [[Olav Bjaaland]], as the front runner. The Amundsen party gained weight on their return travel from the [[South Pole]].

== Weather conditions ==
Scott and Shackleton's experience in 1903 and 1907 gave them first-hand experience of average conditions in Antarctica. [[George Simpson (meteorologist)|Simpson]], Scott's meteorologist 1910–1912, charted the weather during their expedition, often taking two readings a day. On their return to the Ross Ice Shelf, Scott's group experienced prolonged low temperatures from 27 February until 10 March which have only been matched once in 15 years of current records.&lt;ref name="Solomon-2001" /&gt;{{RP|286}} The exceptional severity of the weather meant they failed to make the daily distances they needed to get to the next depot. This was a serious position as they were short of fuel and food. When Scott, Wilson, and Bowers died (Petty Officer [[Edgar Evans]] and [[Lawrence Oates]] had died earlier during the return from the South Pole) they were {{Convert|11|mi|order=flip}} short of One-Ton Depot, which was {{Convert|140|mi|order=flip}} from Corner Camp, where they would have been safe.

On the other hand, Cherry-Garrard had travelled nearly {{Convert|300|mi|4=-2|order=flip}} in the same area, during the same time period and same temperatures, using a dog team.&lt;ref name="Apsley Cherry-Garrard 1912, page 420–428"&gt;Apsley Cherry-Garrard, The Worst Journey in the World&amp;nbsp;– Antarctic 1910–13, Chapter XIII, dates 19 Feb to 15 Mar 1912, page 420–428.&lt;/ref&gt; Scott also blamed "a prolonged blizzard". But while there is evidence to support the low temperatures, there is only evidence for a "normal" two- to four-day blizzard, and not the ten days that Scott claims.&lt;ref name="Solomon-2001" /&gt;{{RP|318-319}}

== Route marking and depot laying ==
During depot laying in February 1911, Roald Amundsen had his first (and last) {{Convert|180|mi|order=flip}} of his route marked like a Norwegian ski course using marker flags initially every eight miles. He added to this by using food containers painted black, resulting in a marker every mile. From 82 degrees on, Amundsen built a {{Convert|6|ft|abbr=on|adj=on}} cairn every three miles with a note inside recording the cairn's position, the distance to the next depot, and direction to the next cairn.&lt;ref&gt;The South Pole, Roald Amundsen, {{ISBN|1-85065-469-7}}, Volume II, Chapter X, page 22.&lt;/ref&gt; In order not to miss a depot considering the snow and great distances, Amundsen took precautions. Each depot laid out up to 85 degrees (laid out every degree of latitude) had a line of bamboo flags laid out transversely every half-mile for five miles on either side of the depot, ensuring that the returning party could locate the designated depot.

Scott relied on depots much less frequently laid out. For one distance where Amundsen laid seven depots, Scott laid only two. Routes were marked by the walls made at lunch and evening stops to protect the ponies. Depots had a single flag. As a result, Scott has much concern recorded in his diaries over route finding, and experienced close calls about finding depots.&lt;ref&gt;Scott's Last Expedition, entry 25 and 26 Jan 1912, page 431 and entry 12 and 13 Feb 1912, page 443 as examples.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also clear that Scott's team did not travel on several days, because the swirling snow hid their three-month-old outward tracks. With better depot and route marking they would have been able to travel on more days with a following wind which would have filled the sail attached to their sledge, and so travel further, and might have reached safety.

== Food and fuel ==
By the time they arrived at the pole, the health of Scott's team had significantly deteriorated, whereas Amundsen's team actually gained weight during the expedition. While Scott's team managed to maintain the scheduled pace for most of the return leg, and hence was virtually always on full rations, their condition continued to worsen rapidly. (The only delay occurred when they were held for four days by a blizzard, and had to open their summit rations early as a consequence.&lt;ref&gt;Scott's Last Expedition, entry 7 Dec 1911, page 381.&lt;/ref&gt;)

[[Apsley Cherry-Garrard]] in his analysis of the expedition estimated that even under optimistic assumptions the summit rations contained only a little more than half the calories actually required for the man-hauling of sledges.&lt;ref name="Apsley Cherry Gerrard 1921, page 573" /&gt; A carefully planned 2006 re-enactment of both Amundsen's and Scott's travels, sponsored by the [[BBC]], confirmed Cherry-Garrard's theory. The British team had to abort their tour due to the severe weight loss of all members.&lt;ref&gt;Jasper Rees, Blizzard&amp;nbsp;– Race to the pole, BBC Books 2006, {{ISBN|978-0-563-49326-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The experts hinted that Scott's reports of unusually bad surfaces and weather conditions might in part have been due to their exhausted state which made them feel the sledge weights and the chill more severely.

Scott's calculations for the supply requirements were based on a number of expeditions, both by members of his team (e.g., [[Edward Adrian Wilson|Wilson]]'s trip with [[Apsley Cherry-Garrard|Cherry-Garrard]] and [[Henry Robertson Bowers|Bowers]] to the Emperor penguin colony which had each man on a different type of experimental ration), and by Shackleton. Apparently, Scott didn't take the strain of prolonged man-hauling at high altitudes sufficiently into account.

Since the rations contained no [[B vitamins|B]] and [[Vitamin C|C vitamins]], the only source of these vitamins during the trek was from the slaughter of ponies or dogs.  This made the men progressively malnourished, manifested most clearly in the form of [[scurvy]].&lt;ref name=Preston/&gt;

Scott also had to fight with a shortage of fuel due to leakage from stored fuel cans which used leather washers. This was a phenomenon that had been noticed previously by other expeditions, but Scott took no measures to prevent it. Amundsen, in contrast, had learned the lesson and had his fuel cans soldered closed. A fuel depot he left on Betty's Knoll was found 50 years later still full.&lt;ref name="Huntford-1985"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Huntford|first1=Roland|title=The Last Place on Earth|date=1985|publisher=Hodder &amp; Stoughton Ltd|location=London|isbn=0340381019|edition=Hardcover|url=https://www.amazon.com/Last-Place-Earth-Roland-Huntford/dp/0340381019/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1479764934&amp;sr=1-1|accessdate=21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|553}}

Dehydration may also have been a factor. Amundsen's team had plenty of fuel due to better planning and soldered fuel cans. Scott had a shortage of fuel and was unable to melt as much water as Amundsen. At the same time Scott's team were more physically active in man-hauling the sledges.

== Clothing and goggles ==
It has been said (by the present-day explorer [[Ranulph Fiennes]] amongst others) that Scott's team was appropriately dressed for man-hauling in their woolen and wind-proof clothing, and as Amundsen was skiing it was appropriate he wore furs. Skiing at the pace of a dog team is a strenuous activity. Yet Amundsen never complained about the clothing being too hot. That is because the furs are worn loosely so air circulates and sweat evaporates. Scott's team, on the other hand, made regular complaints about the cold.

Amundsen's team did initially have problems with their boots. However, the depot-laying trips of January and February 1911 and an abortive departure to the South Pole on 8 September 1911 allowed changes to be made before it was too late.

Scott's team suffered regularly from [[snow blindness]] and sometimes this affected over half the team at any one time.&lt;ref&gt;Apsley Cherry-Garrard, The Worst Journey in the World&amp;nbsp;– Antarctic 1910–13, Chapter X, entry for 10 Dec, page 367 as an example.&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, there was no recorded case of snow blindness during the whole of Amundsen's expedition. On the return journey, Amundsen's team rested during the "day" (when the sun was in front of them) and travelled during the "night" (when the sun was behind them) to minimise the effects of snow blindness.

== Delay in meeting Scott's returning party ==
In 1921, [[Edward Evans, 1st Baron Mountevans|'Teddy' Evans]] wrote in his book ''South with Scott'' that Scott had left the following written orders at Cape Evans.{{sfn|Karen May 2012, ''Could Captain Scott have been saved? Revisiting Scott's last expedition'', Polar Record |p=1-19}}

{{quote
| About the first week of February I should like you to start your third journey to the South, the object being to hasten the return of the third Southern unit [the polar party] and give it a chance to catch the ship. The date of your departure must depend on news received from returning units, the extent of the depot of dog food you have been able to leave at One Ton Camp, the state of the dogs, etc&amp;nbsp;...It looks at present as though you should aim at meeting the returning party about March 1 in Latitude 82 or 82.30.{{sfn|Evans, E.R.G.R. 1949, ''South with Scott'', London: Collins |p=187-188}}}}

He did however place a lesser importance upon this journey than that of replenishing the food rations at One Ton Depot.

He continued his instructions in the next paragraph "You will of course understand that whilst the object of your third journey is important, that of the second is vital. At all hazards three X.S. units of provision must be got to One Ton Camp by the date named (19th January), and if the dogs are unable to perform this task, a man party must be organised."&lt;ref&gt;Evans, E.R.G.R. 1953 South With Scott London Collins p = 173&lt;/ref&gt; with that qualification he closed his notes regarding his instructions for the dogs.

Expedition member [[Apsley Cherry-Garrard]] did not mention Scott's order in his 1922 book ''The Worst Journey in the World''. However, in the 1948 preface to his book,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Gray |first = Richard | title = Scott of the Antarctic could have been saved if his orders had been followed, say scientists | date = 31 December 2012 | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/antarctica/robert-falcon-scott/9770678/Scott-of-the-Antarctic-could-have-been-saved-if-his-orders-had-been-followed-say-scientists.html | work = The Telegraph | accessdate = 27 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; he discusses Scott's order. Cherry-Garrard writes that he and [[Edward L. Atkinson|Edward Atkinson]] reached Cape Evans on 28 January. Scott had estimated Atkinson would reach camp by 13 January.{{sfn|Evans, E.R.G.R. 1949, ''South with Scott'', London: Collins |p=187-188}} Atkinson, now the senior officer discovered that the dog handler [[Cecil Meares]] had resigned from the expedition and that neither Meares nor anyone else had resupplied dog food to the depots. Cherry-Garrard also wrote "In my opinion he [Atkinson] would not have been fit to take out the dogs in the first week of February".

On 13 February, Atkinson set off on the first lap southwards to Hut Point with the dog assistant, Dimitri Gerov, and the dogs to avoid being cut off by disintegrating sea ice. Atkinson and Gerov were still at [[Hut Point]] when, on 19 February, [[Tom Crean (explorer)|Tom Crean]] arrived on foot from the Barrier and reported that Lt [[Edward Evans, 1st Baron Mountevans|Edward Evans]] was lying seriously ill in a tent some {{Convert|35|mi|order=flip|round=5}} to the south, and in urgent need of rescue.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Lashly, and Crean had formed the final Support Party which had left Scott on 3 January. Lashly had stayed on the Barrier to nurse Evans while Crean walked to Hut Point. Both were awarded Albert (lifesaving) medals&lt;/ref&gt;  Atkinson decided that this mission was his priority, and set out with the dogs to bring Evans back. This was achieved; the party was back at Hut Point on 22 February.

Atkinson sent a note back to the Cape Evans base camp requesting either the meteorologist Wright or Cherry-Garrard to take over the task of meeting Scott with the dogs. Chief meteorologist Simpson was unwilling to release Wright from his scientific work, and Atkinson therefore selected [[Apsley Cherry-Garrard]]. It was still not in Atkinson's mind that Cherry-Garrard's was a relief mission, and according to Cherry-Garrard's account, told him to "use his judgement" as to what to do in the event of not meeting the polar party by One Ton, and that Scott's orders were that the dogs must not be risked. Cherry-Garrard left with Gerov and the dogs on 26 February, carrying extra rations for the polar party to be added to the depot and 24 days' of dog food. They arrived at One Ton Depot on 4 March and did not proceed further south. Instead, he and Gerov, after waiting there for Scott for several days, apparently mostly in blizzard conditions (although no blizzard was recorded by Scott some 100 miles further south until 10 March), they returned to Hut Point on 16 March, in poor physical condition and without news of the polar party.

On the return journey from the pole, Scott reached the 82.30°S meeting point for the dog teams three days ahead of schedule, around 27 February 1912. Scott's diary for that day notes "We are naturally always discussing possibility of meeting dogs, where and when, etc. It is a critical position. We may find ourselves in safety at the next depot, but there is a horrid element of doubt." By 10 March it became clear that the dog teams were not coming: "The dogs which would have been our salvation have evidently failed. Meares [the dog-driver] had a bad trip home I suppose. It's a miserable jumble."

Around 25 March, awaiting death in his tent at latitude 79.30°S, Scott speculated, in a farewell letter to his expedition treasurer [[Edgar Speyer|Sir Edgar Speyer]], that he had overshot the meeting point with the dog relief teams, writing "We very nearly came through, and it's a pity to have missed it, but lately I have felt that we have overshot our mark. No-one is to blame and I hope no attempt will be made to suggest that we had lacked support." (Farewell letter to Sir Edgar Speyer, cited from Karen May 2012.){{sfn|Karen May 2012, ''Could Captain Scott have been saved? Revisiting Scott's last expedition'', Polar Record |p=1-19}}

== Other reasons for Scott's failure ==
; Geology samples
: Scott's team continued to haul over 14&amp;nbsp;kg (30&amp;nbsp;lb) of rock samples. This would appear to be a major handicap when pulling a sledge in a race against the weather and a shortage of food and fuel. Scott could have left the samples at one of the cairns along the way to be picked up later. However, Ranulph Fiennes has suggested that the extra weight would not have been a major handicap.&lt;ref&gt;Captain Scott, Ranulph Fiennes, {{ISBN|0-340-82697-5}}-page 249.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tryggve Gran]] on the other hand thought "they might have saved themselves the bother".&lt;ref&gt;Diary, Tryggve Gran, entry 23 Nov 1912, quoted Last Place on Earth, Roland Huntford, {{ISBN|0-340-38101-9}}, page 556.&lt;/ref&gt;
; Final five-man team
: Scott's planning, equipment and rations had been based on three sledge teams of four men ascending the Beardmore, with a team turning back every 10 days or so as rations required finally leaving one four-man team to attempt the pole. At the last moment when down to two teams (Scott's and Evans's) Scott decided to send a returning party of three, and take on five. This increased the cooking time for the team of five and affected the fuel supply.&lt;ref&gt;Scott's Last Expedition, entry 5 Jan 1912, page 414.&lt;/ref&gt; It also meant the Evans party of three had to try to split the ration pack (at a time when they were cold and tired and later when one member was suffering from scurvy) to leave an allowance for the fifth man in Scott's party. This also will have affected the seepage of fuel from cans which were opened and then re-closed and left for several weeks before Scott's team got to them. Moreover, for some unexplained reason Scott had ordered Evans's team to cache their skis a week before so Bowers (the fifth man) walked to the pole and back to the cached skis (360&amp;nbsp;miles) while the rest of Scott's team skied.
; Misuse of the dog team
: For no clear reason Scott took the dogs on 140&amp;nbsp;miles further than originally planned. This meant killing the ponies early (and starting man-hauling earlier) to feed the dogs for no obvious benefit to the overall expedition. Scott also gave conflicting and changing orders for their use to each returning party. It was only in late February 1912 that it was discovered that the final supplies needed by Scott's returning party had not been delivered to One Ton Depot. Cherry-Garrard was sent with these supplies on 25 February 1912 and he was relieved to discover that he had beaten Scott's team to the depot.&lt;ref name="Apsley Cherry-Garrard 1912, page 420–428" /&gt; He also found that promised supplies of dog food were not in place. Cherry-Garrard remained at the depot, within {{Convert|100|km|4=-1}} of Scott, 4–10 March 1912 when he could possibly have saved Scott, Wilson, Bowers, and Oates if the management of the dog team had been better.
; Navigation
: Amundsen used prepared navigation sheets that simplified the calculations for his team when they were tired and cold. Four out of his team of five were qualified navigators. Amundsen's expedition also used a [[sextant]] during the journey, which is a relatively light and simple piece of equipment. He also attended a symposium that reviewed how to fix position at high latitudes. Scott used a [[theodolite]] which is heavier and requires more mental arithmetic.&lt;ref name="Huntford-1985" /&gt;{{RP|482}} Scott also lacked navigators having only one per team. Scott dismissed Cherry-Garrard's request for navigational training and Wilson only attempted to learn how to read latitudes at the last moment.&lt;ref name="Huntford-1985" /&gt;{{RP|473, 538}}
; Camp routine
: Amundsen used canisters that left his sledges permanently lashed and loaded. Scott's team had to unload, and load and relash their sledge at every camp, no matter what the weather.

{{wiktionary}}
The term '''cross-reference''' can refer to either:
* An instance within a [[document]] which refers to related information elsewhere in the same document. In both printed and online dictionaries cross-references are important because they form a network structure of relations existing between different parts of data, dictionary-internal as well as dictionary external.&lt;ref&gt;Sandro Nielsen (1999): "Mediostructures in Bilingual LSP Dictionaries." In: ''Lexicographica. International Annual for Lexicography'' 15, 90–113.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In an [[Index (publishing)|index]], a cross reference is often denoted by ''See also''.  For example, under the term ''Albert Einstein'' in the index of a book about Nobel Laureates, there may be the cross-reference ''See also: Einstein, Albert''.
* In [[hypertext]], cross-referencing is maintained to a document with either in-context (XRIC) or out-of-context (''XROC'') cross-referencing.  These are similar to [[Key Word in Context|KWIC and KWOC]].
* In programming, "cross-referencing" means the listing of every file name and line number where a given [[identifier#In computer science|named identifier]] occurs within the program's [[source tree]].
* In a [[relational database management system]], a table can have an xref as prefix or suffix to indicate it is a [[cross-reference table]] that joins two or more tables together via [[primary key]].

== Structure of a cross reference ==
In a document, especially those authored in a [[Content management system]],
a cross-reference has two major aspects:
* A visible form that appears when the document is presented to the reader
* A technical mechanism that resides within the system

The visible form contains text, graphics, and other indications that:
* Enable the reader to follow the cross reference to the referenced content
* May enable the reader to understand what is being referred to, or what to expect upon following the reference
* May present to the reader some information from the referenced content

The technical mechanism that resides within the system:
* Identifies what location is being referred to
* Permits the system to present appropriate referencing text when the location containing the reference is presented to a reader
* Permits the system to offer a control (such as a link) that a reader can use when the content is presented in electronic form to access the referenced content

== How cross references contribute to usability of a document or set of documents ==
If the cross reference mechanism is well designed, the reader will be able to follow each cross reference to the referenced content whether the content is presented in print or electronically.

An author working in a content management system is responsible for identifying subjects of interest that cross documents, and creating appropriate systems of cross references to support readers who seek to understand those subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rockley|first1=Ann|last2=Cooper|first2=Charles|title=Managing Enterprise Content: A Unified Content Strategy|date=2012|publisher=New Riders|isbn=978-0321815361|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; For an individual cross reference, an author should ensure that location and content of the target of the cross reference are clearly identified, and the reader can easily determine how to follow the cross reference in each medium in which publication is supported.

[[Content strategy]] practitioners (known as content strategists) specialize in planning content to meet business needs, taking into account the processes for creating and maintaining the content, and the systems that support the content.

'''''Errors and omissions excepted''''' ('''''E&amp;OE'''''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Oxford Dictionary of Abbreviations|editor=Alexander, Fran|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England|year=1998|edition=Second|chapter=E &amp; OE|isbn=0-19-280073-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a phrase used in an attempt to reduce [[legal liability]] for potentially incorrect or incomplete information supplied in a contractually related document such as a quotation or specification.

It is often applied as a [[disclaimer]] in situations in which the information to which it is applied is relatively fast-moving. In [[legal term]]s, it seeks to make a statement that information cannot be relied upon, or may have changed by the time of use.

It is regularly used in accounting, to "excuse slight mistakes or oversights."&lt;ref&gt;Stewart Rapalje, Robert Linn Lawrence. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=rllHAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "A Dictionary of American and English Law: With Definitions of the Technical Terms of the Canon and Civil Laws. Also, Containing a Full Collection of Latin Maxims, and Citations of Upwards of Forty Thousand Reported Cases in which Words and Phrases Have Been Judicially Defined Or Construed, Volume 1 (Google eBook)"]''. Frederick D. Linn &amp; Company, 1888
&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also used when a large amount of information is listed against a product, to state that—to the best of the supplier's knowledge—the information is correct, but that they will not be held responsible if an error has been committed.

A '''Guide to information sources''' (or a '''bibliographic guide''', a '''literature guide''', a '''guide to reference materials''', a '''subject gateway''', etc.) is a kind of '''[[metabibliography]]'''. Ideally it is not just a listing of [[bibliographies]], [[reference work]]s  and other [[information source]]s, but more like a [[textbook]] introducing users to the information sources in a given field (in general).

Such guides may have many different forms: Comprehensive or highly selective, printed or electronic sources, annoteted listings or written chapters etc.

==Functions==
Often used as curriculum tools for [[bibliographic instruction]], the guides help library users find materials or help those unfamiliar with a discipline understand the key sources.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7790">'''Abbreviations''' ({{Lang-he-n|ראשי תיבות}}) are a common part of the '''[[Hebrew language]]''', with many organizations, places, people and concepts known by their abbreviations.

==Typography==
[[Acronym]]s in Hebrew use a special [[punctuation]] mark called [[gershayim]] (&lt;span style="font-size:large;"&gt;[[״]]&lt;/span&gt;). This mark is placed between the last two letters of the non-inflected form of the acronym (e.g. "report" in singular is "{{Hebrew|דו״ח}}," hence the plural "{{Hebrew|דו״חות}}")&lt;span style="unicode-bidi:bidi-override"&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=he:כללי הפיסוק – יא. גרשיים, סעיף 30|publisher=[[Academy of the Hebrew Language]]|url=http://hebrew-academy.huji.ac.il/hahlatot/Punctuation/Pages/P33.aspx|language=Hebrew |trans-title=Punctuation — select rules |accessdate=2010-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Acronyms can be formed from strings of single initial letters, e.g. "{{Hebrew|[[:he:פזצט"א|פזצט״א]]}}" pazátsta (for {{Hebrew|פול, זחל, צפה, טווח, אש}}), or multiple initial letters, e.g. {{Hebrew|ארה״ק}} (for {{Hebrew|ארץ הקודש}}, the Holy Land) or {{Hebrew|ראשל״צ}} ráshlats (for {{Hebrew|ראשון לציון}}, [[Rishon LeZion]]).

If the acronym is read as is, then the spelling should be with a [[final form]] letter. If, on the other hand, the acronym is read as the complete phrase or read as the individual letters, then it should be spelled with a medial form letter.&lt;ref name=hebrewAc /&gt; In practice, this rule is more often than not ignored, and the acronyms spelled either way.

[[Abbreviation]]s that are truncations of a single word, consisting of the first letter or first several letters of that word (as opposed to acronyms formed from initials or truncations of more than one word) are denoted using the punctuation mark [[geresh]] (&lt;span style="font-size:large;"&gt;{{Hebrew|[[׳]]}}&lt;/span&gt;) by placing the sign after the last letter of the abbreviation (e.g. "Ms.": "&lt;span&gt;{{Hebrew|גב׳}}&lt;/span&gt;").&lt;ref name=hebrewAc&gt;{{cite web|script-title=he:הפיסוק - מבחר כללים|publisher=[[Academy of the Hebrew Language]] |url=http://hebrew-academy.huji.ac.il/hahlatot/Punctuation/Pages/P32.aspx|language= Hebrew |trans-title=Punctuation — select rules|accessdate=2010-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in practice, single and double quotes are often used instead of the special punctuation marks (for which most keyboards do not have keys), with the single quote used both in acronyms{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} and abbreviations.

==Pronunciation==
Often (and especially when they describe a noun), Hebrew acronyms are pronounced by the insertion of a vowel sound (usually {{IPA-he|a|}}) between the letters. These vowels often appear in transliterations to other scripts. Examples include [[Shas]] ({{Hebrew|ש״ס}}), [[Tanakh]] ({{Hebrew|תנ״ך}}) and [[Shin Bet|Shabak]] ({{Hebrew|שב״כ}}). There are exceptions to the use of "a", such as [[Irgun|Etzel]] ({{Hebrew|אצ״ל}}).

When one of the letters is [[waw (letter)|vav]] or [[yodh|yud]], these may be read as vowels ("u"/“o” and "i") instead: {{Hebrew|דו״ח}} (''duakh''/''dokh'' = {{Hebrew|דין וחשבון}}, judgement and account); {{Hebrew|אדמו״ר}} (''admor'' = {{Hebrew|אדוננו מורנו ורבנו}}, hasidic rebbe; {{Hebrew|שו״ת}} (''shut'' = {{Hebrew|שאלות ותשובות}}, questions and answers); {{Hebrew|סכו״ם}} (''sakum'' = {{Hebrew|סכין כף ומזלג}}, knife spoon and fork); {{Hebrew|תפו״ז}} (''tapuz'' = {{Hebrew|תפוח זהב}}, orange, lit. golden apple); {{Hebrew|או״ם}} (''um'' = {{Hebrew|האומות המאוחדות}}, the [[United Nations]]); {{Hebrew|ביל״ו}} [[Bilu]]; {{Hebrew|לח״י}} [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]]. (An exception is {{Hebrew|בית״ר}}, [[Beitar]], pronounced ''beytar''.)

Hebrew numbers (e.g. year numbers in the [[Hebrew calendar]]) are written the same way as acronyms, with gershayim before the last character, but pronounced as separate letter names. For example, &lt;span dir="rtl"&gt;&lt;!--{{#time:xhxjY}}--&gt;{{Hebrew|ה׳תשע״ה}}&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span dir="ltr"&gt;(5775&amp;nbsp;[[Anno Mundi|AM]], or 2014-2015&amp;nbsp;[[Common Era|CE]]&lt;!--{{#expr:{{#time:xjY}}-3761}}–{{#expr:{{#time:xjY}}-3760}}--&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) is pronounced hei-tav-shin-ayin-hei.

==Usage==
{{main article|List of Hebrew acronyms}}

===People===
Acronyms have been widely used in Hebrew since at least the [[Middle Ages]]. Several important [[rabbi]]s are referred to with acronyms of their names. For example, '''R'''abbi '''S'''hlomo ben '''Y'''itzchak is known as [[Rashi]], '''Ra'''v '''M'''oshe '''b'''en '''M'''aimon ([[Maimonides]]) is commonly known as ''Rambam'' (Hebrew: {{Hebrew|רמב״ם}}), '''Ra'''bbi '''M'''oshe '''b'''en '''N'''ahman ([[Nahmanides]]) is likewise known as the ''Ramban'' (Hebrew: {{Hebrew|רמב״ן}}), and [[Baal Shem Tov|'''B'''aal '''Sh'''em '''T'''ov]] is called the ''Besht'' (Hebrew: {{Hebrew|בעש״ט}}).

A number of such acronyms differ only in their last letter. They all begin with "Mahara-", as an acronym of the words ...{{Hebrew|מורנו הרב רבי}} (''Morenu Ha-Rav rabi ...'', Our teacher the [[Rabbi]] ...)." 
* "[[Maharam (disambiguation)|Maharam]]", with the final "m" standing for a number of names, such as '''M'''oshe and '''M'''eïr.
* "Maharal" for [[Judah Loew ben Bezalel|Judah '''L'''oew ben Bezalel]]
* "Maharash" for either [[Meir Wahl|Meir '''Sh'''auls]] or [[Shmuel Schneersohn]].

===Text===
The usage of Hebrew acronyms extends to liturgical groupings: the word ''[[Tanakh]]'' (Hebrew: תנ״ך) is an acronym for [[Torah|'''T'''orah]] (Five Books of Moses), [[Nevi'im|'''N'''evi'im]] (Book of Prophets), and [[Ketuvim|'''K'''etuvim]] (Hagiographa).

Most often, though, one will find use of acronyms as [[acrostic]]s, in both prayer, poetry (see [[Piyyut]]), and [[kabbalah|kabbalistic]] works. Because each Hebrew letter also has a numeric value, embedding an acrostic may give an additional layer of meaning to these works.

One purpose of acrostics was as a [[mnemonic]] or a way for an author to weave his name as a signature, or some other spiritual thought, into his work, at a time when much was memorized. Examples of prayers which contain acrostics include:
*[[Ashrei]]&amp;nbsp;– The first letter of every verse starts with a consecutive letter of the [[Hebrew alphabet]], with the omission of ''nun''.
*[[Lekhah Dodi]]&amp;nbsp;– The first letter of each stanza (not including the first and last) spells out "Shlomo Halevi" (Hebrew: שלמה הלוי) the name of the author [[Shlomo Halevi Alkabetz]].
*[[Shokhen Ad]]&amp;nbsp;– Lines are written so that letters line up vertically, spelling the name [[Yitzchak]], which may refer to the [[patriarch]] Yitzchak, or to an unknown [[author]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12342">{{About|the English personal pronoun|other uses|I (disambiguation)}}
The pronoun '''''I''''' {{IPAc-en|aɪ}} is the [[grammatical person|first-person]] [[grammatical number|singular]] [[nominative case]] [[personal pronoun]] in [[Modern English]].  It is used to refer to one's [[self]] and is [[capitalization|capitalized]], although other pronouns, such as ''he'' or ''she'', are not capitalized.

The grammatical variants of ''I'' are ''me'', ''my'', ''mine'', and ''myself''.

==Etymology==
{{more footnotes|section|date=December 2015}}
{{Further|Old English pronouns|Proto-Germanic pronouns|Proto-Indo-European pronouns}}
English ''I'' originates from [[Old English]] (OE) ''ic''. Its predecessor ''ic'' had in turn originated from the continuation of [[Proto-Germanic]] *''ik'', and ''ek''; the asterisk denotes an unattested form, ''ek'' was attested in the [[Elder Futhark]] inscriptions (in some cases notably showing the variant ''eka''; see also [[ek erilaz]]). Linguists assume ''ik'' to have developed from the unstressed variant of ''ek''. Variants of ''ic'' were used in various English dialects up until the 1600s.{{sfn| OED online}}

Germanic cognates are: [[Old Frisian]] ''ik'', [[Old Norse]] ''ek'' ([[Danish language|Danish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] ''jeg'', [[Swedish language|Swedish]] ''jag'', [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] ég), [[Old High German]] ''ih'' ([[German language|German]] ''[[:wikt:ich|ich]]'') and [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''ik'' and in [[Dutch language|Dutch]] also "ik".

The Proto-Germanic root came, in turn, from the [[Proto Indo-European language]] (PIE). The reconstructed PIE pronoun is *''egō, egóm'', with cognates including
[[Sanskrit]] ''aham'', [[Hittite language|Hittite]] ''uk'', [[Latin]] ''ego'', [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἐγώ}} ''egō'', [[Common Slavonic|Old Slavonic]] ''azъ'' and [[Alviri-Vidari language|Alviri-Vidari]] (an Iranian language) {{lang|fa|اَز}} ''az''.

The oblique forms are formed from a stem  ''*me-'' (English ''me''), the plural from ''*wei-'' (English ''we''), the oblique plurals from ''*ns-'' (English ''us'') and from Proto-Germanic ''*unseraz'', PIE ''*no-s-ero-'' (''our, ours'').

== Capitalization ==
''I'' (and only this form of the pronoun) is the only pronoun that is always capitalized in English.{{Efn-lr|Other pronouns may be capitalized when referring to the Deity ("God's in His heaven") and, of course, when beginning a sentence. The capitalization of the first person pronoun is distinctive of English, although it is common in other languages to capitalize a second person pronoun, for example ''Sie'' in German.}} This practice became established in the late 15th century, though lowercase ''i'' was sometimes found as late as the 17th century.{{Sfn|Fowler|2015}}

Like the  other [[English personal pronouns]] ''we'' (''us''), ''he'' (''him''), ''she'' (''her''), and ''they'' (''them''), the pronoun ''I'' has several singular case forms.{{efn-lr |name=Terminology|Terminological note: &lt;br/&gt;Authorities use different terms for the inflectional ([[grammatical case|case]]) forms of the personal pronouns, such as the [[oblique case|oblique-case]] form ''me'', which is used as a direct object, indirect object, or object of a preposition, as well as other uses. For instance, one standard work on English grammar, ''A Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language'', uses the term ''objective case'', while another, ''[[The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language]]'', uses the term ''accusative'' case. Similarly, some use the term ''nominative'' for the form ''I'', while others use the term ''subjective''. Some authorities use the term ''genitive'' for forms such as ''my'' where others use the term ''possessive''. Some grammars refer to ''my'' and ''mine'', respectively, as the ''dependent genitive'' and the ''independent genitive'', while others call ''my'' a ''possessive adjective'' and ''mine'' a ''possessive pronoun''.}}
These are:{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|p=458}} 
* ''I'', the nominative (or subjective{{efn-lr |name=Terminology}}) case form 
* ''me'', the accusative (or objective{{efn-lr |name=Terminology}}) case form
* ''my'', the dependent genitive (or possessive adjective{{efn-lr |name=Terminology}}) case form
* ''mine'', the independent genitive case form (or possessive pronoun{{efn-lr |name=Terminology}})

=== Use of ''I'' and ''me'' ===
There are some situations in which only the nominative form (''I'')  is grammatically correct and others in which only the accusative form (''me'')  is correct. There are also situations in which one form is used in informal style (and was often considered ungrammatical by older prescriptive grammars) and the other form is preferred in formal style.{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|p=458}}

====Exclusive use of nominative ''I''====
In all varieties of standard English, the nominative form ''I'' is used exclusively when it is the whole{{efn-lr|name=Non-coordinative|Not part of a  coordinative construction with ''and'', for instance.}} subject of an ''explicit'' verb,{{sfn |Huddleston|Pullum|2002|pp=458-459}} e.g. 
* "I did it."
not 
* * "Me did it."{{efn-lr|name=Asterisk|The asterisk preceding this example indicates that the utterance is not acceptable in standard English. For an explanation of this linguistic convention, see [[Asterisk#Linguistics]]}}
With other pronouns, such as ''we'' (strictly speaking when used as a personal determiner), there may be exceptions to this in some varieties of English.{{sfn |Huddleston|Pullum|2002|p=459}}

====Exclusive use of accusative ''me''====
In all varieties of standard English, the accusative form ''me'' is used exclusively when it is the whole{{efn-lr|name=Non-coordinative}} direct or indirect object{{efn-lr|including the subject of a non-finite clause introduced by ''for'', e.g. "For me to do that would be more than a crime."}} of a verb or preposition.{{sfn |Huddleston|Pullum|2002|p=459}}  The accusative ''me'' is also required in a number of constructions such as "Silly me!"{{sfn |Huddleston|Pullum|2002|pp=461–462}}

====Alternative use of nominative and accusative====
In many situations, both the nominative ''I'' and the accusative ''me'' are encountered.{{sfn |Huddleston|Pullum|2002|pp=459–461}}

When the pronoun is used as a subjective predicative complement, the nominative ''I'' is sometimes encountered in (very)  formal style:{{sfn |Huddleston|Pullum|2002|pp=459–461}}
* "It is I."
But this is often seen as hypercorrect and may be unacceptable, as in:
* * "This one [photograph] is I as a baby.{{efn-lr|name=Asterisk}}
''Me'' is usually preferred as a subjective predicate, especially in informal style:{{sfn |Huddleston|Pullum|2002|p=459}}
* "This is me as a baby." 
* "It's me!"
The nominative ''I'' is more common in this role when it is followed by a relative clause:{{sfn |Huddleston|Pullum|2002|p=459}}
* "It is I she loves." 
* "It is I who love you." 
though even here ''me'' is more common in non-formal style:
* "It's me she loves." 
* "It's me who loves you."

Following ''as'' or ''than'' (without a following explicit verb),  the accusative form is common:{{sfn |Huddleston|Pullum|2002|p=460}}
* "She is older than me."
However, where it is possible to think of the pronoun as the subject of an implicit verb and ''than'' or ''as'' as a conjunction, the nominative ''I'' is found in formal style:{{sfn |Huddleston|Pullum|2002|p=460}}
* "She is older than I [am]."

In [[Australian English]], [[British English]] and [[Irish English]], many speakers have an unstressed form of ''my'' that is identical to ''me'' (see [[English personal pronouns#Archaic and non-standard forms|archaic and non-standard forms of English personal pronouns]]).

=====Coordinative constructions=====
The above applies when the pronoun stands alone as the subject or object.
In some  varieties  English (particularly formal English), those rules also apply in coordinative constructions such as "you and I".{{sfn |Huddleston|Pullum|2002|pp=462–463}} So the correct form is 
* "My husband and I wish you a merry Christmas."
* "Between you and me ..."

In some varieties of non-standard informal English, the accusative is sometimes used when the pronoun is part of a coordinative ''subject'' construction,{{sfn |Huddleston|Pullum|2002|pp=462–463}} as in
* "Phil and me wish you a merry Christmas."
This is highly stigmatized.{{sfn |Huddleston|Pullum|2002|pp=462-463}}

On the other hand, the use of the nominative ''I'' in coordinative constructions like "you and I"where ''me'' would be used in a non-coordinative object is less stigmatized – and in some cases so widespread as to be considered a variety of standard English:{{sfn |Huddleston |Pullum |2002 |p=463}} 
* "President Bush graciously invited Michelle and I to meet with him ..."
* "All debts are cleared between you and I".

'''Informationsdienst Wissenschaft e.V.''' or idw (The Science Information Service) operates an Internet platform, which bundles the press reports and dates of important events from about 1,000 scientific institutions, including universities, technical colleges, governmental and non-governmental research institutes and institutes to support research or scientific administration. idw (a registered charitable society) also operates an expert broker, the idw expert finder, which is exclusively for journalists. This makes idw one of the most comprehensive sources of science news in the German-speaking area. Foreign journalists and institutions (mostly European) now use idw as well. 
[[Image: new idw-logo.png|thumb|Informationsdienst Wissenschaft e.v.]] 

The two main objectives of idw are:
* To provide the public with a comprehensive picture of science in the German-speaking area.
* To create a close network between the linked (research) institutions.

==Services==
The information in idw can be accessed free of charge - either directly on idw’s www pages, or by using an individually configurable RSS feed or as an e-mail subscriber. Any user can request the information covering the topics and regions which interest him. All idw services can be used free of cost - the current news ticker, the science calendar, research in the archive (which contains more than 350,000 press releases), and the list of institutions linked to idw. idw also provides journalists with instruments for contacting experts, and maintains a database with science photos.
The members' press offices have various possibilities of communicating with journalists. Membership is only offered to German or foreign institutions which perform research or teaching, or which support science or are active in science in some other way.

==Idea and Foundation==
The original idea of idw was to provide experts for journalists. Using the American ProfNet as example,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Heisser Draht zur Forschung |url=http://www.spiegel.de/unispiegel/studium/0,1518,140281,00.html |work=[[Der Spiegel]] |date=19 June 2001 |accessdate=17 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the press officers of [http://www.uni-bayreuth.de Universitaet Bayreuth], the [[Ruhr University Bochum]] and the Clausthal University of Technology, in collaboration with Computing Centre of Clausthal University of Technology/[http://www.tu-clausthal.de TU Clausthal], developed a concept for a German language network, by means of the new media. The concept was technically implemented by the staff of the Computing Centre of the Clausthal University of Technology. A total of nine staff members in Bayreuth, Bochum and Clausthal are responsible for programming, maintaining and developing the idw operating system, for user services and further development of the content.

==Financial Support and Development==
The initial phase (1996–1999) was guaranteed by project support from the Federal Ministry for Education and Research ([[BMBF]]). The technical development of the idw was supported by the Ministry, together with the [http://www.stifterverband.de Stifterverband fuer die Deutsche Wissenschaft] (Donor Association for German Science). idw has been working closely for years with the initiative [[Wissenschaft im Dialog]] (Science in Dialogue). idw has been economically independent since 2000 and is financed by contributions from member institutions. It has been organised as a registered charitable society (gemeinnütziger e. V.) since 2002.

==Significance and Scope==
idw has developed as a recognised and accepted source for German language science and for science journalism. It has become an instrument for public relations work for scientific institutions. 
About 37,000 subscribers (figure for June 2018&lt;ref&gt;http://www.idw-online.de/en/aboutus&lt;/ref&gt;) receive regular reports from idw, including some 7,900 journalists. About 1,000 institutions publish their press reports and dates of important events via idw.

{{merge|list of classical abbreviations|date=July 2017}}
This is a '''list of common [[Latin]] [[abbreviation]]s'''. Nearly all the abbreviations below have been adopted by [[Modern English]].  However, with some exceptions (for example, ''versus'' or ''[[modus operandi]]''), most of the Latin referent words and phrases are perceived as foreign to English.  In a few cases, English referents have replaced the original Latin ones (e.g., "[[rest in peace]]" for RIP and "post script" for PS).

[[Latin]] was once the universal academic language in Europe. From the 18th century authors started using their mother tongues to write books, papers or proceedings. Even when Latin fell out of use, many Latin abbreviations continued to be used due to their precise simplicity and Latin's status as a learnèd language.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

In July 2016, the government of the [[United Kingdom]] announced that its websites would no longer use Latin abbreviations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/2016/07/20/changes-to-the-style-guide-no-more-eg-and-ie-etc/|title=Changes to the style guide: no more eg, and ie, etc|accessdate=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|-
|{{Anchor|pro re nata}}[[Pro re nata|PRN]]||''[[pro re nata]]''||"before a thing is born"||"As used in standard medical jargon, PRN is understood to mean 'as needed'. This reading of the abbreviation implies that the delivery of the prescription (by a suitable person, following medications protocol) is done in a reactive, passive way. eg WHEN THAT HAPPENS, DO THIS. A more literal translation of the Latin is 'before a thing is born', which is an instruction to act pro-actively: eg BEFORE THAT HAPPENS, DO THIS . A prn medication delivery therefore properly done when a medic JUDGES that it should be done, in order to prevent a specified problem from occurring.

&lt;br/&gt;Example: ''The noble gases, '''viz.''' helium, neon, argon, xenon, krypton and radon, show a non-expected behaviour when exposed to this new element.''

Similarly the film ''Kramer vs. Kramer'' is in England (at least to a lawyer): ''Kramer and Kramer'' although it would be written ''Kramer v Kramer.'' In Scots Law, the ''v'' is pronounced ''against.''  For example, ''Donoghue v Stevenson'' is pronounced ''Donoghue against Stevenson.''

Words and abbreviations that have been in general use, but are currently used less often:
* a.C.n. = [[ante Christum natum]] = [[Anno Domini|BC]] = before Christ
* ad. nat. delt. = ad naturam delineavit = he/she drew (this artwork) after nature
* AMDG (''[[Ad maiorem Dei gloriam]]'' or ''[[ad majorem Dei gloriam]]''): Latin - "For the greater glory of God". It is the [[motto]] of the [[Society of Jesus]].

* a.U.c. (''[[ab Urbe condita]]'' or ''Anno Urbis conditae''): Latin for "from the foundation of [[Rome|the City]]":&lt;ref name="USGPOstyle" /&gt; it refers to the [[founding of Rome]], which occurred in [[750s BC|753 BC]] according to [[Livy]]'s count. Used as a reference point in ancient Rome for establishing dates, before being supplanted by other systems. Also ''anno Urbis conditae'' (a.U.c.) ("in the year that the City [Rome] was founded"). For example, the year 2007 [[AD]] is the year 2761 ''ab Urbe condita'' (753 + 1 + 2007 = 2761); though, rigorously speaking, the year ''a.U.c.'' begins on April 21, the ''[[birthday of Rome]]'' (i.e. the day that [[Romulus]] was traditionally believed to have founded the Eternal City).  (The reason for adding 1 to 753 is that the Romans counted dates "inclusively," i.e., including both the first and the last day or year in the count.)

The '''Museum of Comparative Zoology''', full name "The Louis Agassiz Museum of Comparative Zoology", often abbreviated simply to "MCZ", is the [[zoology]] museum located on the grounds of [[Harvard University]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. It is one of three natural history research museums at Harvard whose public face is the [[Harvard Museum of Natural History]]. Harvard MCZ's collections consist of some 21 million specimens, of which several thousand are on rotating display at the public museum.  The current director of the Museum of Comparative Zoology is [[James Hanken]], the Louis Agassiz Professor of Zoology at Harvard University.

Many of the exhibits in the public museum have not only zoological interest but also historical significance. Past exhibits have included a [[fossil]] [[sand dollar]] which was found by [[Charles Darwin]] in 1834, Captain Cook's [[mamo]], and two [[pheasant]]s that once belonged to [[George Washington]], now on loan to Mount Vernon in Virginia.

The Harvard Museum of Natural History is physically connected to the [[Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology]]; for visitors, one admission ticket grants access to both museums. The research collections of the Museum of Comparative Zoology are not open to the public.

==History==
The Museum of Comparative Zoology was founded in 1859 through the efforts of zoologist [[Louis Agassiz]], and the museum used to be referred to as "The Agassiz" after its founder.&lt;ref&gt;Winsor, Mary P. [https://books.google.com/books?id=w6vLeToUzHEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=reading+the+shape+of+nature&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj7qvSLpLfZAhWFPN8KHUbnBN4Q6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=reading%20the%20shape%20of%20nature&amp;f=false Reading the Shape of Nature: Comparative Zoology at the Agassiz Museum] (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt;  Agassiz designed the collection to illustrate the variety and [[Comparative anatomy|comparative relationships]] of [[animal]] life.

The [[Radcliffe Zoological Laboratory]] was created in 1894 when [[Radcliffe College]] rented a space on the fifth floor of the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University to convert into a women's laboratory. Prior to this acquisition, Radcliffe science laboratories were taught using inadequate facilities, converting spaces such as bathrooms in old houses into physics laboratories, which Harvard professors often refused to teach in&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=HUL Access/2.0|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/doi/10.1111/1468-0424.12292/abstract|doi=10.1111/1468-0424.12292/epdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;.The laboratory space was converted from an office or storage closet, and was sandwiched between other invertebrate storage rooms on the fifth floor.

==Departments==
The museum comprises twelve departments: [[Biological Oceanography]], [[Entomology]], [[Herpetology]], [[Ichthyology]], [[Invertebrate paleontology|Invertebrate Paleontology]], [[Invertebrate zoology|Invertebrate Zoology]], [[Mammalogy]], [[Marine invertebrates]], [[Malacology]], [[Ornithology]], [[Population Genetics]], and [[Vertebrate Paleontology]].  The [[Ernst Mayr|Ernst Mayr Library]] and its archives join in supporting the work of the museum.  The Ernst Mayr Library is a founding member of the [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org Biodiversity Heritage Library].

==Publications==
The museum publishes two journals: the ''Bulletin of the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard College'', first published in 1869,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bulletin of the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard College|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/2803|website=Biodiversity Heritage Library|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Breviora'', first published in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Breviora|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/3989|website=Biodiversity Heritage Library|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Displays==
In contrast to numerous more modern museums, the Harvard Museum of Natural History has many hundreds of [[taxidermy|stuffed animals]] on display, from the collections of the Museum of Comparative Zoology.  Notable exhibits include [[whale]] [[skeleton]]s, the largest [[turtle]] [[Animal shell|shell]] ever found (eight feet long), "the Harvard [[mastodon]]", a {{convert|42|ft|m|sing=on}} long ''[[Kronosaurus]]'' skeleton, the skeleton of a [[dodo]], and a [[coelacanth]] preserved in fluid. The two-story Great Mammal Hall was renovated in 2009 in celebration of the 150th anniversary of founding of the Museum of Comparative Zoology.

New and changing exhibitions in the Harvard Museum of Natural History include "Evolution" (2008); "The Language of Color" (2008 to 2013); "Arthropods: Creatures that Rule" (2006); "New England Forests" (2011); and "Mollusks: Shelled Masters of the Marine Realm" (2012).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10820">'''Non-well-founded set theories''' are variants of [[axiomatic set theory]] that allow sets to contain themselves and otherwise violate the rule of [[well-foundedness]]. In non-well-founded set theories, the [[axiom of regularity|foundation axiom]] of [[ZFC]] is replaced by axioms implying its negation.

The study of non-well-founded sets was initiated by [[Dmitry Mirimanoff]] in a series of papers between 1917 and 1920, in which he formulated the distinction between well-founded and non-well-founded sets; he did not regard well-foundedness as an [[axiom]]. Although a number of axiomatic systems of non-well-founded sets were proposed afterwards, they did not find much in the way of applications until [[Peter Aczel]]’s [[hyperset theory]] in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;Pakkan and Akman (1994, [http://tinf2.vub.ac.be/~dvermeir/mirrors/www.cs.bilkent.edu.tr/%257Eakman/jour-papers/air/node8.html section link]); Rathjen (2004); Sangiorgi (2011) pp. 17–19, 26&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory of non-well-founded sets has been applied in the [[logic]]al [[model (abstract)|modelling]] of non-terminating [[Computing|computational]] processes in computer science ([[process algebra]] and [[final semantics]]), [[linguistics]] and [[natural language]] [[semantics]] ([[situation theory]]), philosophy (work on the [[Liar Paradox]]), and in a different setting, [[non-standard analysis]].{{sfnp|Ballard|Hrbáček|1992|p=}}

== Details ==
In 1917, Dmitry Mirimanoff introduced&lt;ref&gt;Levy (2002), p.&amp;nbsp;68; Hallett (1986), [https://books.google.com/books?id=TM3AKPYdQVgC&amp;pg=PA186 p.&amp;nbsp;186]; Aczel (1988) p. 105 all citing Mirimanoff (1917)&lt;/ref&gt; the concept of [[well-founded set|well-foundedness]] of a set:

:A set, x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, is well-founded if it has no infinite descending membership sequence &lt;math&gt; \cdots \in x_2 \in x_1 \in x_0. &lt;/math&gt;

In ZFC, there is no infinite descending ∈-sequence by the [[axiom of regularity]]. In fact, the axiom of regularity is often called the ''foundation axiom'' since it can be proved within ZFC&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; (that is, ZFC without the axiom of regularity) that well-foundedness implies regularity. In variants of ZFC without the [[axiom of regularity]], the possibility of non-well-founded sets with set-like ∈-chains arises. For example, a set ''A'' such that ''A'' ∈ ''A'' is non-well-founded.

Although Mirimanoff also introduced a notion of isomorphism between possibly non-well-founded sets, he considered neither an axiom of foundation nor of anti-foundation.&lt;ref&gt;Aczel (1988) p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; In 1926, [[Paul Finsler]] introduced the first axiom that allowed non-well-founded sets. After Zermelo adopted Foundation into his own system in 1930 (from previous work of [[von Neumann]] 1925–1929) interest in non-well-founded sets waned for decades.{{sfnp|Aczel|1988|p=107}} An early non-well-founded set theory was [[Willard Van Orman Quine]]’s [[New Foundations]], although it is not merely ZF with a replacement for Foundation.

Several proofs of the independence of Foundation from the rest of ZF were published in 1950s particularly by [[Paul Bernays]] (1954), following an announcement of the result in earlier paper of his from 1941, and by [[Ernst Specker]] who gave a different proof in his [[Habilitationsschrift]] of 1951, proof which was published in 1957. Then in 1957 [[Rieger's theorem]] was published, which gave a general method for such proof to be carried out, rekindling some interest in non-well-founded axiomatic systems.{{sfnp|Aczel|1988|pp=107–108}} The next axiom proposal came in a 1960 congress talk of [[Dana Scott]] (never published as a paper), proposing an alternative axiom now called [[Anti-Foundation Axiom|SAFA]].{{sfnp|Aczel|1988|pp=108–109}} Another axiom proposed in the late 1960s was [[Maurice Boffa]]'s axiom of [[superuniversality]], described by Aczel as the highpoint of research of its decade.{{sfnp|Aczel|1988|p=110}} Boffa's idea was to make foundation fail as badly as it can (or rather, as extensionality permits): Boffa's axiom implies that every [[extensionality|extensional]] [[binary relation|set-like]] relation is isomorphic to the elementhood predicate on a transitive class.

A more recent approach to non-well-founded set theory, pioneered by M. Forti and F. Honsell in the 1980s, borrows from computer science the concept of a [[bisimulation]]. Bisimilar sets are considered indistinguishable and thus equal, which leads to a strengthening of the [[axiom of extensionality]]. In this context, axioms contradicting the axiom of regularity are known as '''anti-foundation axioms''', and a set that is not necessarily well-founded is called a '''hyperset'''.

Four mutually [[Independence (mathematical logic)|independent]] anti-foundation axioms are well-known, sometimes abbreviated by the first letter in the following list:
# '''A'''FA ("Anti-Foundation Axiom") – due to M. Forti and F. Honsell (this is also known as [[Aczel's anti-foundation axiom]]);
# '''S'''AFA ("Scott’s AFA") – due to [[Dana Scott]],
# '''F'''AFA ("Finsler’s AFA") – due to [[Paul Finsler]],
# '''B'''AFA ("Boffa’s AFA") – due to [[Maurice Boffa]].
They essentially correspond to four different notions of equality for non-well-founded sets. The first of these, AFA, is based on [[accessible pointed graph]]s (apg) and states that two hypersets are equal if and only if they can be pictured by the same apg.  Within this framework, it can be shown that the so-called [[Quine atom]], formally defined by Q={Q}, exists and is unique.

Each of the axioms given above extends the universe of the previous, so that: [[Von Neumann universe|V]] ⊆ A ⊆ S ⊆ F ⊆ B. In the Boffa universe, the distinct Quine atoms form a proper class.&lt;ref&gt;Nitta, Okada, Tsouvaras (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

It is worth emphasizing that hyperset theory is an extension of classical set theory rather than a replacement: the well-founded sets within a hyperset domain conform to classical set theory.

== Applications ==
{{expand section|date=November 2012}}
Aczel’s hypersets were extensively used by [[Jon Barwise]] and [[John Etchemendy]] in their 1987 book ''The Liar'', on the [[liar's paradox]]; The book is also good introduction to the topic of non-well-founded sets.

Boffa’s superuniversality axiom has found application as a basis for axiomatic [[nonstandard analysis]].{{sfnp|Kanovei|Reeken|2004|p=303}}

A '''note''' is a string of text placed at the bottom of a [[page (paper)|page]] in a book or document or at the end of a chapter, volume or the whole text.  The note can provide an author's comments on the main text or [[citation]]s of a reference work in support of the text, or both.

'''Footnotes''' are notes at the foot of the page while '''endnotes''' are collected under a separate heading at the end of a chapter, volume, or entire work.  Unlike footnotes, endnotes have the advantage of not affecting the layout of the main text, but may cause inconvenience to readers who have to move back and forth between the main text and the endnotes.

In some editions of the Bible, notes are placed in a narrow column in the middle of each page between two columns of biblical text.

== Numbering and symbols==

In English, a footnote is normally flagged by a [[superscript]]ed number immediately following that portion of the text the note references, each such footnote being numbered sequentially. Occasionally a number between brackets or parentheses is used instead, thus: [1], which can also be superscripted, as in Wikipedia's own citation style rendered within this very page.

Typographical devices such as the [[asterisk]] (*) or [[dagger (typography)|dagger]] (†) may also be used to point to footnotes; the traditional order of these symbols in English is [[Asterisk|*]], [[Dagger (typography)|†]], [[Double dagger (typography)|‡]], [[Section sign|§]], [[Vertical Bar|‖]], [[Pilcrow|¶]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bringhurst (2005).  ''The Elements of Typographic Style'' (version 3.1).  Point Roberts, WA: Hartley and Marks. pp 68–69.  Bringhurst goes on to say “But beyond the ... double dagger, this order is not familiar to most readers, and never was.”&lt;/ref&gt;  Other symbols, including the [[Number Sign|#]], [[Delta (letter)|Δ]], [[Lozenge|◊]], [[Arrow (symbol)|↓]], and [[Index (typography)|☞]], have also been used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livesandletters.ac.uk/papers/FOR_2005_04_001.pdf|author=William H. Sherman|title=Toward a History of the Manicule|accessdate=2013-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Many of these symbols are used, for example, in [[John Bach McMaster]], ''History of the People of the United States''&lt;/ref&gt; In documents like [[Public transport timetable|timetables]], many different symbols, letters and numbers may be used to refer the reader to particular notes.

== Academic usage==
Notes are most often used as an alternative to long explanatory notes that can be distracting to readers. Most literary style guidelines (including the [[Modern Language Association]] and the [[American Psychological Association]]) recommend limited use of foot and endnotes. However, publishers often encourage note references in lieu of parenthetical references. Aside from use as a bibliographic element, notes are used for additional information or explanatory notes that might be too digressive for the main text. Footnotes are heavily utilized in academic institutions to support claims made in academic essays covering myriads of topics.

In particular, footnotes are the normal form of citation in historical journals. This is due, firstly, to the fact that the most important references are often to archive sources or interviews which do not readily fit standard formats, and secondly, to the fact that historians expect to see the exact nature of the evidence which is being used at each stage.

The MLA (Modern Language Association) requires the superscript numbers in the main text to be placed following the punctuation in the phrase or clause the note is in reference to. The exception to this rule occurs when a sentence contains a dash, in which case the superscript would precede it.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Aside from their technical use, authors use notes for a variety of reasons:
* As signposts to direct the reader to information the author has provided or where further useful information is pertaining to the subject in the main text.

==Government documents==
The [[US Government Printing Office]] Style Manual devotes over 660 words to the topic of footnotes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Chapter 15: Footnotes, indexes, contents, and outlines | work=U.S. Government Printing Office Style Manual | url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-STYLEMANUAL-2008/html/GPO-STYLEMANUAL-2008-17.htm | accessdate=October 26, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[NASA]] has guidance for footnote usage in its historical documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=A Guide to Footnotes and Endnotes for NASA History Authors | work=NASA History Style Guide | url=https://history.nasa.gov/footnoteguide.html | accessdate=March 24, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal writing==
Associate Justice [[Stephen Breyer]] of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] is famous in the American legal community for his writing style, in which he never uses notes. He prefers to keep all citations within the text (which is permitted in American legal citation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=In Justice Breyer's Opinion, A Footnote Has No Place | date=1995-07-28 | publisher= | url =https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE1DC163EF93BA15754C0A963958260 | work =[[The New York Times]] | pages = | accessdate = 2008-04-30 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard A. Posner]] has also written against the use of notes in judicial opinions.&lt;ref name=Posner2001&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Posner|first1=Richard A.|title=Against Footnotes|journal=Court Review|date=Summer 2001|url=http://aja.ncsc.dni.us/courtrv/cr38-2/CR38-2Posner.pdf|accessdate=2014-10-13|publisher=American Judges Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Bryan A. Garner]], however, advocates using notes instead of inline citations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Oddi |first=Marcia |url=http://indianalawblog.com/archives/2005/01/indiana_courts_99.html |title=Indiana Courts - Footnotes in Judicial Opinions |publisher=The Indiana Law Blog |date=2005-01-07 |accessdate=2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==HTML==
[[HTML]], the predominant [[markup language]] for web pages, has no mechanism for marking up notes. Despite a number of different proposals over the years, and repeated pleas from the user base, the [[working group]] has been unable to reach a consensus on it. Because of this, [[MediaWiki]], for example, has had to introduce its own &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag for citing references in notes, an idea which has since also been implemented for generic use by the ''[[Nelson (HTML preprocessor)|Nelson]]'' HTML preprocessor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Nelson HTML Preprocessor | url=http://nelsonhtml.com | accessdate=2009-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It might be argued that the [[hyperlink]] partially eliminates the need for notes, being the web's way to refer to another document. However, it does not allow citing to offline sources and if the destination of the link changes, the link can become dead or irrelevant.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jill Lepore]]. "[https://web.archive.org/web/20150125141230/http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/cobweb The Cobweb]", ''[[The New Yorker]]'', 26 January 2015 issue. Retrieved 25 January 2015. Archived from [http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/cobweb the original].&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The sign is historically equal to the [[asterisks]] used by [[Aristarchus of Samothrace]] at the [[Musaeum|Mouseion at Alexandria]]. It was used for the critical editions of Homer's writings where it "marked a verse incorrectly repeated in another passage" and was used together with other signs such as the [[obelus]].&lt;ref&gt;L.D. Reynolds and N.G. Wilson. Scribes and Scholars: A guide to the Transmission of Greek and Latin Literature. Oxford University Press, 1991, 3rd edition, {{ISBN|0-19-872146-3}}, p. 10-11&lt;/ref&gt;

The London printer [[Richard Jugge]] is generally credited as the inventor of the footnote, first used in the [[Bishops' Bible]] of 1568.&lt;ref&gt;Chuck Zerby, ''The Devil's Details: A History of Footnotes'', 2007, {{ISBN|1931229058}}, p. 28 and ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;

Early printings of the Douay Bible used two closely spaced colons (actually squared four dot punctuation mark U+2E2C) to indicate a marginal note.

==Literary device==
At times, notes have been used for their comical effect, or as a literary device.

* [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' uses footnotes along with left and right marginal notes in Book II Chapter 2. The three types of notes represent comments from the three siblings doing their homework: Shem, Shaun, and Issy.
* [[J.G. Ballard]]'s  "Notes Towards a Mental Breakdown," is one sentence ("A discharged Broadmoor patient compiles 'Notes Towards a Mental Breakdown,' recalling his wife's murder, his trial and exoneration.") and a series of elaborate footnotes to each one of the words.
*[[Mark Z. Danielewski]]'s ''[[House of Leaves]]'' uses what are arguably some of the most extensive and intricate footnotes in literature. Throughout the novel, footnotes are used to tell several different narratives outside of the main story. The physical orientation of the footnotes on the page also works to reflect the twisted feeling of the plot (often taking up several pages, appearing mirrored from page to page, vertical on either side of the page, or in boxes in the center of the page, in the middle of the central narrative).
* [[Flann O'Brien]]'s ''[[The Third Policeman]]'' utilizes extensive and lengthy footnotes for the discussion of a fictional philosopher, [[de Selby]]. These footnotes span several pages and often overtake the main plotline, and add to the absurdist tone of the book.
* [[David Foster Wallace]]'s ''[[Infinite Jest]]'' includes over 400 endnotes, some over a dozen pages long. Several literary critics suggested that the book be read with two bookmarks.  Wallace uses footnotes, endnotes, and in-text notes in much of his other writing as well.
*[[Manuel Puig]]'s ''Kiss of the Spider Woman'' (originally published in Spanish as ''El beso de la mujer araña'') also makes extensive use of footnotes.
*[[Garrison Keillor]]'s ''[[Lake Wobegon Days]]'' includes lengthy footnotes and a parallel narrative.
*[[Mark Dunn]]'s ''[[Ibid: A Life]]'' is written entirely in endnotes.
*[[Luis d'Antin van Rooten]]'s ''[[Mots d'Heures: Gousses, Rames]]'' (the title is in [[French language|French]], but when pronounced, sounds similar to the [[English language|English]] ''"Mother Goose Rhymes"''), in which he is allegedly the editor of a manuscript by the fictional François Charles Fernand d’Antin, contains copious footnotes purporting to help explain the nonsensical French text. The point of the book is that each written French poem ''sounds'' like an English [[nursery rhyme]].
*[[Terry Pratchett]] has made numerous uses within his novels. The footnotes will often set up running jokes for the rest of the novel.
*[[B.L.A.]] and [[G.B. Gabbler]]'s meta novel ''[[The Automation]]'' makes uses of footnotes to break the [[fourth wall]]. The narrator of the novel, known as "B.L.A.," tells the fantastical story as if true, while the editor, Gabbler, annotates the story through footnotes and thinks the manuscript is only a [[prose poem]] attempting to be a literary masterwork.
*[[Susanna Clarke]]'s ''[[Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell]]'' uses dozens of footnotes referencing a number of fictional books including magical scholarship and biographies.
*[[Jonathan Stroud]]'s ''[[The Bartimaeus Trilogy]]'' uses footnotes to insert comical remarks and explanations by one of the protagonists, Bartimaeus.
*[[Michael Gerber (parodist)|Michael Gerber]]'s ''[[Barry Trotter]]'' parody series used footnotes to expand [[one-line joke]]s in the text into paragraph-long comedic monologues that would otherwise break the flow of the narrative.
*[[John Green (author)|John Green]]'s ''[[An Abundance of Katherines]]'' uses footnotes in which he says: "[They] can allow you to create a kind of secret second narrative, which is important if, say, you're writing a book about what a story is and whether stories are significant."{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}
* Dr Carol Bolton uses extensive footnotes to provide the modern reader with a cipher for a novel about the travels of the fictional Spanish traveller [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275996974_Through_Spanish_Eyes_Robert_Southey's_Double_Vision_in_Letters_from_England_By_Don_Manuel_Alvarez_Espriella_%281807%29 Don Manuel Alvarez Espriella], an early 19th-century construct of Robert Southey's, designed to provide him with vehicle to critique the societal habits of the day.
*[[Jasper Fforde]]'s ''[[Thursday Next]]'' series exploits the use of footnotes as a communication device (the ''footnoterphone'') which allows communication between the main character’s universe and the fictional bookworld.
*[[Ernest Hemingway]]'s ''[[Natural History of the Dead]]'' uses a footnote to further satirize the style of a history while making a sardonic statement about the extinction of "humanists" in modern society.
*[[Pierre Bayle]]'s ''[[Dictionnaire Historique et Critique|Historical and Critical Dictionary]]'' follows each brief entry with a footnote (often five or six times the length of the main text) in which saints, historical figures, and other topics are used as examples for philosophical digression.  The separate footnotes are designed to contradict each other, and only when multiple footnotes are read together is Bayle's core argument for [[Fideism|Fideistic skepticism]] revealed.  This technique was used in part to evade the harsh censorship of 17th century France.
*[[Mordecai Richler]]'s novel ''[[Barney's Version (novel)|Barney's Version]]'' uses footnotes as a character device that highlights unreliable passages in the narration. As the editor of his father's autobiography, the narrator's son must correct any of his father's misstated facts. The frequency of these corrections increases as the father falls victim to both hubris and [[Alzheimer's disease]]. While most of these changes are minor, a few are essential to plot and character development.
*In [[Vladimir Nabokov]]'s ''[[Pale Fire]]'', the main plot is told through the annotative endnotes of a fictional editor.
*''[[Bartleby y Compañía]],'' a novel by [[Enrique Vila-Matas]], is stylized as footnotes to a nonexistent novel.
*The works of [[Jack Vance]] often have footnotes, detailing and informing the reader of the background of the world in the novel.
*[[Stephen Colbert]]'s ''[[I Am America (And So Can You!)]]'' uses both footnotes and margin notes to offer additional commentary and humor.
*[[Doug Dorst]]'s novel ''[[S. (Dorst novel)|S.]]'' uses footnotes to explore the story and relationship of characters V.M. Straka and F.X. Caldeira.

'''''The Observer's Books''''' were a series of small, pocket-sized books, published by [[Frederick Warne &amp; Co]] in the United Kingdom from 1937 to 2003. They covered a variety of topics including hobbies, art, history and wildlife. The aim of these books was to interest the observer and they have also been popular amongst children. Some of them have become collector's items.&lt;ref name=OPSCS&gt;{{cite web|title=About the books|url=http://www.observersbooksociety.co.uk/about_books.html|publisher=OPSCS|accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cogswell&gt;{{cite book|last=Cogswell|first=Barry|title=To Have Borne Witness: Memories and Observations Regarding Human Population and Species Loss|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YLJnAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA290|year=2014|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=978-1-4969-0310-5|page=290}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the dedicated collector this could be a lifetime's work as there are over 800 variations, some of which are now rare. The values of the books can vary from 50 pence to hundreds of pounds.  

The books were produced with paper [[dust jacket|dust covers]] up until 1969. Each one had a unique pattern of squiggly lines at the top but these were not especially practical because they were easy to rip and stain. From 1970, the covers were protected with a glossy coating. These types are often referred to as "Glossies". From the late 1970s, Warne decided to laminate the covers to the actual books to make them sturdier and more resistant to wear.

The first Observer's guide was published in 1937, and was on the subject of British birds.&lt;ref name=Cogswell/&gt; This is now rare, and a mint copy with a dust cover is worth hundreds of pounds. The same year, Warne published a second Observer's book on British wild flowers. A mint copy of this book is worth around £220. When the popularity of these was recognized, several more titles were added 'uniform in the series', but during World War II production was limited due to paper and labour shortages. Even so, by 1941 Warne had published the first six Observer's books.

In 1942 a special edition book was brought out on "airplanes" {{sic}}. This book had no number in the series, as it was brought out to help people spot enemy warplanes.&lt;ref name=Cogswell/&gt; It was reprinted in 1943 and 1945. 

The first few Observer's titles had focused on nature, but gradually subjects like geology, music and architecture were introduced. 'Spotter' titles like ''Aircraft'', ''Automobiles'' and ''Railway Locomotives'' proved popular. During the 1950s and 60s collecting sets of these books was popular among children and adults alike. 

When Warne was acquired by [[Penguin Books|Penguin books]] in 1983, Warne brought out new editions of the Observer's books. These were slightly bigger than the original books, and were in paperback, not hardback. The same year Penguin, with permission of Warne, started printing their own, more up-to-date Observer's books. These again were slightly larger than the originals, but were hardbacks. Like the later original Observer's books, the dust covers were laminated to the actual book. There were two types of the Penguin Observer's books: Bloomsbury Observer's, and Claremont Observer's, (of which there were only 12 different editions).

After a hiatus of 17 years, Peregrine Books published the appropriately titled ''Observer's Book of Observer's Books'' in 1999, in a format that matched the original editions and was numbered 99 so as to follow on from the last 'official' title. As the title implies, it is a guide to the series with details of its history, authors, and print-runs. As a sign of the series' popularity, this potentially obscure book has been reprinted no fewer than six times. More recently the series has been rounded up to 100 with the publication of ''Wayside and Woodland'' in 2003.

[[File:Pompeii-couple.jpg|thumb|right|This wall painting found in the Roman city of [[Pompeii]] is an example of a primary source about people in Pompeii in Roman times. ([[Portrait of Paquius Proculo]])]]

In the study of [[history]] as an academic discipline, a '''primary source''' (also called an '''original source''') is an [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]], document, diary, [[manuscript]], [[autobiography]], recording, or any other source of [[information]] that was created at the time under study. It serves as an original source of information about the topic. Similar definitions can be used in [[library science]], and other areas of scholarship, although different fields have somewhat different definitions. In [[journalism]], a primary source can be a person with direct knowledge of a situation, or a document written by such a person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Journalism: Primary Sources|url=http://infoguides.pepperdine.edu/c.php?g=287355&amp;p=1915752|publisher=Pepperdine University|accessdate=January 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Primary sources are distinguished from [[secondary sources]], which cite, comment on, or build upon primary sources. Generally, accounts written after the fact with the benefit (and possible distortions) of hindsight are secondary.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/20130726061349/http://www.lib.umd.edu/ues/guides/primary-sources Primary, secondary and tertiary sources]". University Libraries, University of Maryland. &lt;/ref&gt; A secondary source may also be a primary source depending on how it is used.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ithacalibrary.com/sp/subjects/primary Primary and secondary sources]". Ithaca College Library.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a memoir would be considered a primary source in research concerning its author or about his or her friends characterized within it, but the same memoir would be a secondary source if it were used to examine the culture in which its author lived. "Primary" and "secondary" should be understood as relative terms, with sources categorized according to specific historical contexts and what is being studied.&lt;ref name=Handlin/&gt;{{rp|118–246}}&lt;ref name=Kragh&gt;{{Cite book| last=Kragh| first=Helge| title=An Introduction to the Historiography of Science| year=1989| publisher=Cambridge University Press| isbn=0-521-38921-6| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d2zy_QSq2b0C&amp;pg=PA121&amp;lpg=PA121&amp;dq=%22secondary+source%22+historiography |page=121 |quote=[T]he distinction is not a sharp one. Since a source is only a source in a specific historical context, the same source object can be both a primary or secondary source according to what it is used for.|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance of source classification==

===History===

[[File:donfelipe.jpg|thumb|360px|right|From a letter of Philip II, King of Spain, 16th century]]
In scholarly writing, an important objective of classifying sources is to determine their independence and reliability.&lt;ref name=Kragh/&gt; In contexts such as historical writing, it is almost always advisable to use primary sources and that "if none are available, it is only with great caution that [the author] may proceed to make use of secondary sources."&lt;ref name=Cipolla&gt;{{Cite book|last=Cipolla|first=Carlo M.|title=Between Two Cultures:An Introduction to Economic History|page=27|publisher=W. W.

That this imposition is basic in any understanding of the past is clear from the rules that documents should not be altered, or that any material damaging to a historian's argument or purpose should not be left out or suppressed. These rules mean that the sources or the texts of the past have an integrity and that they do indeed 'speak for themselves', and that they are necessary constraints through which past reality imposes itself on the historian.|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other fields===
In scholarly writing, the objective of classifying sources is to determine the independence and reliability of sources.&lt;ref name=Kragh/&gt; Though the terms ''primary source'' and ''secondary source'' originated in [[historiography]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} as a way to trace the history of historical ideas, they have been applied to many other fields. For example, these ideas may be used to trace the history of scientific theories, literary elements and other information that is passed from one author to another.

In [[scientific literature]], a primary source is the original publication of a scientist's new data, results and theories. In [[political history]], primary sources are documents such as official reports, speeches, pamphlets, posters, or letters by participants, official election returns and eyewitness accounts. In the [[history of ideas]] or [[intellectual history]], the main primary sources are books, essays and letters written by intellectuals; these intellectuals may include historians, whose books and essays are therefore considered primary sources for the intellectual historian, though they are secondary sources in their own topical fields. In [[religious history]], the primary sources are [[religious texts]] and descriptions of religious [[ceremonies]] and [[rituals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://researchguides.library.tufts.edu/content.php?pid=60919&amp;sid=447878|title=Primary Sources - Religion|website=Research Guides at Tufts University|date=26 August 2014|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of [[cultural history]] could include fictional sources such as novels or plays. In a broader sense primary sources also include artifacts like photographs, newsreels, coins, paintings or buildings created at the time. Historians may also take [[Artifact (archaeology)|archaeological artifacts]] and oral reports and interviews into consideration. Written sources may be divided into three types.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Howell | first1 = Martha C. | last2 = Prevenier | first2 = Walter. | title = From reliable sources : an introduction to historical method | year = 2001 | publisher = Cornell University Press | location = Ithaca, N.Y. | isbn = 0-8014-8560-6 | pages =20–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''[[Narrative]] sources''' or '''literary sources''' tell a story or message. They are not limited to fictional sources (which can be sources of information for contemporary attitudes) but include [[diary|diaries]], films, biographies, leading philosophical works and [[scientific works]].
*'''Diplomatic sources''' include [[charter]]s and other legal documents which usually follow a set format.
*'''Social documents''' are records created by organizations, such as registers of births and tax records.

In historiography, when the study of history is subject to historical scrutiny, a secondary source becomes a primary source. For a biography of a historian, that historian's publications would be primary sources. Documentary films can be considered a secondary source or primary source, depending on how much the filmmaker modifies the original sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Cripps |first=Thomas |year=1995 |title=Historical Truth: An Interview with Ken Burns |journal=American Historical Review |volume=100 |issue=3 |pages=741–764 |doi=10.2307/2168603 |jstor= 2168603|publisher=The American Historical Review, Vol. 100, No. 3 |postscript=. |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lafayette College Library, provides a synopsis of primary sources in several areas of study:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The definition of a primary source varies depending upon the academic discipline and the context in which it is used.&lt;br&gt;
*In the [[humanities]], a primary source could be defined as something that was created either during the time period being studied or afterward by individuals reflecting on their involvement in the events of that time.
*In the [[social sciences]], the definition of a primary source would be expanded to include numerical data that has been gathered to analyze relationships between people, events, and their environment.
*In the [[natural sciences]], a primary source could be defined as a report of original findings or ideas. These sources often appear in the form of research articles with sections on methods and results."&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.lafayette.edu/help/primary/definitions "Primary Sources: what are they?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208191118/http://library.lafayette.edu/help/primary/definitions |date=8 February 2009 }}. Lafayette College Library.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Finding primary sources==
Although many primary sources remain in private hands, others are located in [[archives]], [[libraries]], [[museum]]s, [[historical societies]], and [[special collections]]. These can be public or private. Some are affiliated with universities and colleges, while others are government entities. Materials relating to one area might be spread over a large number of different institutions. These can be distant from the original source of the document. For example, the [[Huntington Library]] in California houses a large number of documents from the United Kingdom.

In the US, digital copies of primary sources can be retrieved from a number of places. The [[Library of Congress]] maintains several digital collections where they can be retrieved. Some examples are [http://www.memory.loc.gov American Memory] and [[Chronicling America]]. The [[National Archives and Records Administration]] also has digital collections in [http://digitalvaults.org/ Digital Vaults]. The [[Digital Public Library of America]] searches across the digitized primary source collections of many libraries, archives, and museums. The [[Internet Archive]] also has primary source materials in many formats.

In the UK, the [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|National Archives]] provides a consolidated search of its own catalogue and a wide variety of other archives listed on the Access to Archives index. Digital copies of various classes of documents at the National Archives (including wills) are available from DocumentsOnline. Most of the available documents relate to England and Wales. Some digital copies of primary sources are available from the [[National Archives of Scotland]]. Many County Record Offices collections are included in Access to Archives, while others have their own on-line catalogues. Many County Record Offices will supply digital copies of documents.

In other regions, [[Europeana]] has digitized materials from across Europe while the [[World Digital Library]] and [[Flickr Commons]] have items from all over the world. [[Trove]] has primary sources from Australia.

Most primary source materials are not digitized and may only be represented online with a record or [[finding aid]]. Both digitized and not digitized materials can be found through catalogs such as [[WorldCat]], the [https://catalog2.loc.gov/ Library of Congress catalog], the [https://www.archives.gov/research/catalog/ National Archives catalog], and so on.

==Using primary sources==
History as an academic discipline is based on primary sources, as evaluated by the community of scholars, who report their findings in books, articles and papers. [[Arthur Marwick]] says "Primary sources are absolutely fundamental to history."&lt;ref name=Marwick&gt;Marwick, Arthur. "Primary Sources: Handle with Care". In Sources and Methods for Family and Community Historians: A Handbook edited by Michael Drake and Ruth Finnegan. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997. {{ISBN|0-521-46580-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ideally, a historian will use all available primary sources that were created by the people involved at the time being studied. In practice some sources have been destroyed, while others are not available for research. Perhaps the only eyewitness reports of an event may be [[memoir]]s, autobiographies, or oral interviews taken years later. Sometimes the only evidence relating to an event or person in the distant past was written or copied decades or centuries later. Manuscripts that are sources for classical texts can be copies of documents, or fragments of copies of documents. This is a common problem in [[classical studies]], where sometimes only a summary of a book or letter has survived. Potential difficulties with primary sources have the result that history is usually taught in schools using secondary sources.

Historians studying the modern period with the intention of publishing an academic article prefer to go back to available primary sources and to seek new (in other words, forgotten or lost) ones. Primary sources, whether accurate or not, offer new input into historical questions and most modern history revolves around heavy use of [[archive]]s and special collections for the purpose of finding useful primary sources. A work on history is not likely to be taken seriously as scholarship if it only cites secondary sources, as it does not indicate that original research has been done.&lt;ref name=Handlin/&gt;

However, primary sources – particularly those from before the 20th century – may have hidden challenges. "Primary sources, in fact, are usually fragmentary, ambiguous and very difficult to analyse and interpret."&lt;ref name=Marwick/&gt; Obsolete meanings of familiar words and social context are among the traps that await the newcomer to historical studies. For this reason, the interpretation of primary texts is typically taught as part of an advanced college or postgraduate history course, although advanced self-study or informal training is also possible.

The following questions are asked about primary sources:
* What is the tone?
* Who is the intended audience?
* What is the purpose of the publication?
* What assumptions does the author make?
* What are the bases of the author's conclusions?
* Does the author agree or disagree with other authors of the subject?
* Does the content agree with what you know or have learned about the issue?
* Where was the source made? (questions of [[systemic bias]])

==Strengths and weaknesses==
In many fields and contexts, such as historical writing, it is almost always advisable to use primary sources if possible, and "if none are available, it is only with great caution that [the author] may proceed to make use of secondary sources."&lt;ref name=Cipolla/&gt; In addition, primary sources avoid the problem inherent in secondary sources in which each new author may distort and put a new spin on the findings of prior cited authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ross|first=Jeffrey Ian|title=Taking Stock of Research Methods and Analysis on Oppositional Political Terrorism|journal=The American Sociologist|volume=35|issue=2|year=2004|pages=26–37|doi=10.1007/BF02692395|quote=The analysis of secondary source information is problematic. The further an investigator is from the primary source, the more distorted the information may be. Again, each new person may put his or her spin on the findings.|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|text="A history, whose author draws conclusions from other than primary sources or secondary sources actually based on primary sources, is by definition [[fiction]] and not history at all."|sign=Kameron Searle|}}

However, a primary source is not necessarily more of an authority or better than a secondary source. There can be [[bias]] and tacit unconscious views which twist historical information.
{{quote|"Original material may be... prejudiced, or at least not exactly what it claims to be."|David Iredale&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Iredale | first1 = David | title = Enjoying archives: what they are, where to find them, how to use them | year = 1973 | publisher = Newton Abbot, David and Charles, | isbn = 0-7153-5669-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The errors may be corrected in secondary sources, which are often subjected to [[peer review]], can be well documented, and are often written by historians working in institutions where methodological accuracy is important to the future of the author's career and reputation. Historians consider the accuracy and [[objectivity (science)|objectiveness]] of the primary sources that they are using and historians subject both primary and secondary sources to a high level of scrutiny. A primary source such as a [[Diary|journal]] entry (or the online version, a blog), at best, may only reflect one individual's [[opinion]] on events, which may or may not be truthful, accurate, or complete.

Participants and [[witness|eyewitness]]es may misunderstand events or distort their reports, deliberately or not, to enhance their own image or importance. Such effects can increase over time, as people create a narrative that may not be accurate.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara W. Sommer and Mary Kay Quinlan, ''The Oral History Manual'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; For any source, primary or secondary, it is important for the researcher to evaluate the amount and direction of bias.&lt;ref&gt;Library of Congress, " Analysis of Primary Sources" [http://memory.loc.gov/learn/lessons/psources/analyze.html online 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, a government report may be an accurate and unbiased description of events, but it may be [[censorship|censored]] or altered for propaganda or [[cover-up]] purposes. The facts can be [[distortion|distorted]] to present the opposing sides in a negative light. [[Barrister]]s are taught that evidence in a court case may be truthful but may still be distorted to support or oppose the position of one of the parties.

==Classifying sources==
Many sources can be considered either primary or secondary, depending on the context in which they are examined.&lt;ref name=Kragh/&gt; Moreover, the distinction between ''primary'' and ''secondary'' sources is subjective and contextual,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dalton| first1=Margaret Stieg|last2=Charnigo|first2=Laurie|title=Historians and Their Information Sources|journal=College &amp; Research Libraries|date=September 2004|volume=65|issue=5|page=419| doi=10.5860/crl.65.5.400|url=http://crl.acrl.org/content/65/5/400.full.pdf+html|accessdate=3 January 2017}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; so that precise definitions are difficult to make.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Delgadillo|first1=Roberto|last2=Lynch|first2=Beverly|title=Future Historians: Their Quest for Information|url=http://crl.acrl.org/content/60/3/245.full.pdf+html|journal=College &amp; Research Libraries|date=May 1999|volume=60|issue=3 |pages=245–259, at 253|quote=[T]he same document can be a primary or a secondary source depending on the particular analysis the historian is doing.|ref=harv}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; A book review, when it contains the opinion of the reviewer about the book rather than a summary of the book, becomes a primary source.&lt;ref name="Princeton"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=book%20review|title=Book reviews |accessdate=22 September 2011 |publisher=Princeton |year=2011 |author=Princeton|work=Scholarly definition document }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VirginiaTech"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.lib.vt.edu/find/byformat/bookreviews.html |title=Book reviews |accessdate=22 September 2011 |publisher=Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University |year=2011 |author=Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University |work=Scholarly definition document |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910082750/http://www.lib.vt.edu/find/byformat/bookreviews.html |archivedate=10 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a historical text discusses old documents to derive a new historical conclusion, it is considered to be a primary source for the new conclusion. Examples in which a source can be both primary and secondary include an obituary&lt;ref name=Duffin&gt;{{Cite book|last=Duffin|first=Jacalyn|title=History of Medicine: A Scandalously Short Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/?id=__oDQ6yDO7kC&amp;pg=PA366&amp;dq=%22secondary+source%22+historiography|year=1999|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=0-8020-7912-1|page=366|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a survey of several volumes of a journal counting the frequency of articles on a certain topic.&lt;ref name=Duffin/&gt;

Whether a source is regarded as primary or secondary in a given context may change, depending upon the present state of knowledge within the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Henige|first=David|title=Primary Source by Primary Source? On the Role of Epidemics in New World Depopulation|journal=Ethnohistory|volume=33|issue=3|year=1986|pages=292–312, at 292|doi=10.2307/481816|jstor=481816|publisher=Ethnohistory, Vol. 33, No. 3|quote=[T]he term 'primary' inevitably carries a relative meaning insofar as it defines those pieces of information that stand in closest relationship to an event or process ''in the present state of our knowledge''. Indeed, in most instances the very nature of a primary source tells us that it is actually derivative.…[H]istorians have no choice but to regard certain of the available sources as 'primary' since they are as near to truly original sources as they can now secure|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if a document refers to the contents of a previous but undiscovered letter, that document may be considered "primary", since it is the closest known thing to an original source; but if the letter is later found, it may then be considered "secondary"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Henige|1986|p=292}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some instances, the reason for identifying a text as the "primary source" may devolve from the fact that no copy of the original source material exists, or that it is the oldest extant source for the information cited.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Ambraseys|first1=Nicholas|last2=Melville|first2=Charles Peter|last3=Adams|first3=Robin Dartrey|title=The Seismicity of Egypt, Arabia, and the Red Sea|year=1994|isbn=0-521-39120-2|publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=https://books.google.com/?id=dtVqdSKnBq4C&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=historiography+%22primary+source%22+%22secondary+source%22|page=7|quote=The same chronicle can be a primary source for the period contemporary with the author, a secondary source for earlier material derived from previous works, but also a primary source when these earlier works have not survived|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forgeries==
Historians must occasionally contend with forged documents that purport to be primary sources. These forgeries have usually been constructed with a fraudulent purpose, such as promulgating legal rights, supporting false pedigrees, or promoting particular interpretations of historic events. The investigation of documents to determine their authenticity is called [[diplomatics]].

For centuries, [[Pope]]s used the forged [[Donation of Constantine]] to bolster the Papacy's secular power. Among the earliest forgeries are false [[Anglo-Saxon charters]], a number of 11th- and 12th-century forgeries produced by [[monastery|monasteries]] and [[abbey]]s to support a claim to land where the original document had been lost or never existed. One particularly unusual forgery of a primary source was perpetrated by [[Sir Edward Dering, 1st Baronet|Sir Edward Dering]], who placed false [[monumental brass]]es in a [[parish church]].&lt;ref&gt;Everyone has Roots: An Introduction to English Genealogy by Anthony J. Camp, published by Genealogical Pub. Co., 1978&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]] "authenticated" the [[Hitler Diaries]], which were later proved to be forgeries. Recently, forged documents have been placed within the [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)#Forgeries discovered in 2005|UK National Archives]] in the hope of establishing a false [[provenance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Introduction to record class R4|url= http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C16525|publisher=The National Archives|accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Leppard| first=David|title=Forgeries revealed in the National Archives – Times Online|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article3867853.ece|work=The Sunday Times|date=4 May 2008|accessdate=4 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, historians dealing with recent centuries rarely encounter forgeries of any importance.&lt;ref name=Handlin&gt;[[Oscar Handlin]] and [[Arthur Meier Schlesinger]], ''Harvard Guide to American History'' (1954)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|22–25}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13862">In [[statistics]], '''qualitative comparative analysis''' ('''QCA''') is a [[data analysis]] technique for determining which logical conclusions a [[data set]] supports. The analysis begins with listing and counting all the combinations of variables observed in the data set, followed by applying the rules of [[logical inference]] to determine which descriptive inferences or implications the data supports. The technique was originally developed by [[Charles Ragin]] in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 | first = Charles C.
 | title = The Comparative Method: Moving Beyond Qualitative and Quantitative Strategies

==Summary of technique==
In the case of categorical variables, QCA begins by listing and counting all types of cases which occur, where each type of case is defined by its unique combination of values of its independent and dependent variables. For instance, if there were four categorical variables of interest, {A,B,C,D}, and A and B were [[dichotomous]] (could take on two values), C could take on five values, and D could take on three, then there would be 60 possible types of observations determined by the possible combinations of variables, not all of which would necessarily occur in real life. By counting the number of observations that exist for each of the 60 unique combination of variables, QCA can determine which descriptive inferences or implications are empirically supported by a data set. Thus, the input to QCA is a data set of any size, from small-N to large-N, and the output of QCA is a set of descriptive inferences or implications the data supports.

In QCA's next step, inferential logic or Boolean algebra is used to simplify or reduce the number of inferences to the minimum set of inferences supported by the data. This reduced set of inferences is termed the "prime implicates" by QCA adherents. For instance, if the presence of conditions A and B is always associated with the presence of a particular value of D, regardless of the observed value of C, then the value that C takes is irrelevant. Thus, all five inferences involving A and B and any of the five values of C may be replaced by the single descriptive inference "(A and B) implies the particular value of D".

To establish that the prime implicants or descriptive inferences derived from the data by the QCA method are causal requires establishing the existence of causal mechanism using another method such as process tracing, formal logic, intervening variables, or established multidisciplinary knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O88-qualitativecomparatvnlyss.html qualitative comparative analysis - History Of qualitative comparative analysis | Encyclopedia.com: Dictionary Of Sociology&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The method is used in [[social science]] and is based on the [[wikt:binary|binary]] logic of [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]], and attempts to ensure that all possible combinations of variables that can be made across the cases under investigation are considered.

==Motivation==
The technique of listing case types by potential variable combinations assists with case selection by making investigators aware of all possible case types that would need to be investigated, at a minimum, if they exist, in order to test a certain hypothesis or to derive new inferences from an existing data set. In situations where the available observations constitute the entire population of cases, this method alleviates the small N problem by allowing inferences to be drawn by evaluating and comparing the number of cases exhibiting each combination of variables.  The small N problem arises when the number of units of analysis (e.g. countries) available is inherently limited. For example: a study where countries are the unit of analysis is limited in that are only a limited number of countries in the world (less than 200), less than necessary for some (probabilistic) statistical techniques. By maximizing the number of comparisons that can be made across the cases under investigation, causal inferences are according to Ragin possible.&lt;ref name=GOLDTHORPE&gt;J. Goldthorpe, "Current issues in comparative macrosociology" in ''Comparative social research'', 16, 1997, pp. 1–26.&lt;/ref&gt; This technique allows the identification of multiple causal pathways and interaction effects that may not be detectable via statistical analysis that typically requires its data set to conform to one model. Thus, it is the first step to identifying subsets of a data set conforming to particular causal pathway based on the combinations of covariates prior to quantitative statistical analyses testing conformance to a model; and helps qualitative researchers to correctly limit the scope of claimed findings to the type of observations they analyze.

==Criticism==
As this is a logical (deterministic) and not a statistical (probabilistic) technique, with "crisp-set" QCA ([[csQCA]]), the original application of QCA, variables can only have two values, which is problematic as the researcher has to determine the values of each variable. For example: GDP per capita has to be divided by the researcher in two categories (e.g. low = 0 and high = 1). But as this variable is essentially a continuous variable, the division will always be arbitrary. A second, related problem is that the technique does not allow an assessment of the effect of the relative strengths of the independent variables (as they can only have two values).&lt;ref name=GOLDTHORPE/&gt; Ragin, and other scholars such as Lasse Cronqvist, have tried to deal with these issues by developing new tools that extend QCA, such as multi-value QCA ([[mvQCA]]) and fuzzy set QCA ([[fsQCA]]). Note: Multi-value QCA is simply QCA applied to observations having categorical variables with more than two values. Crisp-Set QCA can be considered a special case of Multi-value QCA.&lt;ref name="rihoux2006"&gt;{{Citation | last=Rihoux | first=Benoît | title=Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) and Related Systematic Comparative Methods: Recent Advances and Remaining Challenges for Social Science Research | journal= International Sociology | year=2006 | volume=21 | page=679 | doi=10.1177/0268580906067836 | issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Statistical methodologists have argued that QCA's strong assumptions render its findings both fragile and prone to [[type I error]]. Simon Hug argues that deterministic hypotheses and error-free measures are exceedingly rare in social science and uses [[Monte Carlo simulations]] to demonstrate the fragility of QCA results if either assumption is violated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Qualitative Comparative Analysis: How Inductive Use and Measurement Error Lead to Problematic Inference|url = http://pan.oxfordjournals.org/content/21/2/252|journal = Political Analysis|date = 2013-04-01|issn = 1047-1987|pages = 252–265|volume = 21|issue = 2|doi = 10.1093/pan/mps061|first = Simon|last = Hug}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chris Krogslund, Donghyun Danny Choi, and Mathias Poertner further demonstrate that QCA results are highly sensitive to minor parametric and model-susceptibility changes and are vulnerable to type I error.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Fuzzy Sets on Shaky Ground: Parameter Sensitivity and Confirmation Bias in fsQCA|url = http://pan.oxfordjournals.org/content/23/1/21|journal = Political Analysis|date = 2015-01-01|issn = 1047-1987|pages = 21–41|volume = 23|issue = 1|doi = 10.1093/pan/mpu016|first = Chris|last = Krogslund|first2 = Donghyun Danny|last2 = Choi|first3 = Mathias|last3 = Poertner}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bear F.

==Response to criticisms==
QCA can be performed probabilistically or deterministically with observations of categorical variables. For instance, the existence of a descriptive inference or implication is supported deterministically by the absence of any counter-example cases to the inference; i.e. if a researcher claims condition X implies condition Y, then, deterministically, there must not exist any counterexample cases having condition X, but not condition Y.  However, if the researcher wants to claim that condition X is a probabilistic 'predictor' of condition Y, in another similar set of cases, then the proportion of counterexample cases to an inference to the proportion of cases having that same combination of conditions can be set at a threshold value of for example 80% or higher.  For each prime implicant that QCA outputs via its logical inference reduction process, the "coverage" — percentage out of all observations that exhibit that implication or inference — and the "consistency" — the percentage of observations conforming to that combination of variables having that particular value of the dependent variable or outcome — are calculated and reported, and can be used as indicators of the strength of such a explorative probabilistic inference. In real-life complex societal processes, QCA enables the identification of multiple sets of conditions that are consistently associated with a particular output value in order to explore for causal predictors.

Fuzzy set QCA aims to handle variables, such as GDP per capita, where the number of categories, decimal values of monetary units, becomes too large to use mvQCA, or in cases were uncertainty or ambiguity or measurement error in the classification of a case needs to be acknowledged.&lt;ref name="rihouxMarx2013"&gt;{{Citation | last=Rihoux | first=Benoît | title=QCA, 25 Years after"The Comparative Method": Mapping, Challenges, and Innovations--Mini-Symposium | journal= Political Research Quarterly | year=2013 | volume=66 | pages=167–235 | doi=10.1177/1065912912468269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10284">A '''reference interview''' is a conversation between a [[librarian]] and a [[library]] user, usually at a [[library reference desk|reference desk]], in which the librarian responds to the user's initial explanation of his or her information need by first attempting to clarify that need and then by directing the user to appropriate information resources.

==Definition==
Bopp &amp; Smith (1995) defines the reference interview as the "conversation between a member of the library reference staff and a library user for the purpose of clarifying the user’s needs and aiding the user in meeting those needs".{{sfnp|Bopp|Smith|1995|p=37}} 

According to ODLIS, the reference interview is "the interpersonal communication that occurs between a reference librarian and a library user to determine the person's specific information need(s), which may turn out to be different from the reference question as initially posed...A reference interview may occur in person, by telephone, or electronically (usually via e-mail) at the request of the user, but a well-trained reference librarian will sometimes initiate communication if a hesitant user appears to need assistance".{{sfnp|Reitz|2014}}

== Parts of a reference interview ==

The reference interview is structured to help the librarian provide answers to the library user. In general, the interview is composed of the following stages.{{sfnp|Ross|Nilsen|Dewdney|2002|p=3}}

#Welcoming
#Gathering general information from the user and getting an overview of the problem
#Confirming the exact question
#Intervention, such as giving information, advice or instructions
#Finishing, including feedback and summary

These stages may occur in loops, for example when a clarification of the question leads to the need to establish more background information on the query topic. These steps are designed to put the user at their ease, and then help ensure that they have correctly explained what they require. When the reference librarian believes that the query is fully understood, they attempt to provide resources that help satisfy it. An important and often overlooked final step is checking that the information or service provided was indeed what the library user required.

==Reference interview techniques==

The purpose behind the reference interview structure is to ensure that the library user's [[information need]] is satisfied. The librarian can use a number of interview techniques to help identify the user's exact need. Poor reference interview skills may lead to misinterpretation of the real question, a lack of real help and an unsatisfied library user.{{sfnp|Nilsen|2005|p=3}}

Librarians use many techniques to help identify a user’s information need. With body language, repetition and paraphrasing of what the user says, the interviewer can encourage the user to give more information about what they need. Asking open questions establishes context and helps to identify exactly what is required. A lack of follow-up, or checking that the user found what they required, is arguably one of the most common mistakes made in the reference interview.{{sfnp|Nilsen|2005|p=6}}

==Forming the query==

One of the biggest problems with providing an effective reference service is that of badly formed queries. In this instance, the user's reference question doesn't match up to the information they actually need.{{sfnp|Fields|2006|pp=405-420}} Badly formed queries may lead to user frustration, as they perceive that the reference interview is not solving their problem. 

Many of the techniques used in the reference interview are geared towards developing a badly formed query until a sense of the user's true information need is gained. A great degree of care must be taken when helping users to develop their query. The librarian typically has little insight into the social and psychological barriers that might be preventing the user from explaining their question accurately. Anything from anxiety from an approaching deadline to lack of confidence with language can get in the way.{{sfnp|Murphy|2005|pp=247-252}}

==The virtual reference interview==
{{main| Virtual reference}}
 
As libraries have begun to adopt electronic technology into their operations, the idea of the virtual reference interview has come to light. Virtual reference is a reference service initiated electronically, often in real-time. The user and librarian do not meet face-to-face. Virtual reference services can be conducted, for example, in internet chat, videoconferencing, email, [[cobrowsing|co-browsing]] and [[instant messaging]]. 

Uptake of virtual reference has not been as swift as some had predicted. The complexity of virtual reference may be to blame, as users want information quickly and with the minimum of fuss.{{sfnp|Stormont|2007|p=119}} Some evidence suggests that the problem lies with poor uptake and training among library staff.{{sfnp|Nilsen|2005|p=8}}

==Library users and reference services==

Library users are not always comfortable with reference services, let alone satisfied with them. [[Unobtrusive measures|Unobtrusive user studies]] suggest that only around 55% to 65% of users leave a reference interview satisfied with the result and willing to return.{{sfnp|Nilsen|2005|p=3}} Demographics, social factors and users’ preconceptions about libraries all contribute to this figure. Embarrassment, shyness, and anxiety can prevent a user from approaching the reference desk, and poor signposting and explanation of services can mean that some customers aren't aware that the reference service exists. To be as effective as possible, libraries must be proactive in publicizing their services and reducing the stigma of asking for help.{{sfnp|Robinson|Reid|2007|pp=405-424}}

==Usefulness of the reference interview==

For a long time, the value of the reference interview has stood unquestioned. More recently, with technological developments streamlining some of the tasks which once comprised the interview, some researchers are beginning to question the validity of the reference interview, and the investment that a reference librarian represents.{{sfnp|Ryan|2008|pp=389-399}} Others argue that reference services should broaden their target audience. As people increasingly use the internet to make major, life-affecting decisions, so they also require the services of  professionals who are able to provide help in this environment.{{sfnp|Janes|2003|pp=22-25}} If this proves to be the case, it will become more vital that the reference interview be conducted professionally and successfully. In the age of [[information overload]], a successful reference interview may empower users to confidently make such decisions in their lives.

'''SDS-PAGE''' ('''sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis''') is a variant of [[polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis]], an analytical method in biochemistry for the separation of charged molecules in mixtures by their [[molecular mass]]es in an [[electric field]]. It uses [[sodium dodecyl sulfate]] (SDS) molecules to help identify and isolate [[protein]] molecules.

SDS-PAGE is a [[Discontinuous electrophoresis|discontinuous electrophoretic system]] developed by [[Ulrich K.

SDS-PAGE is an electrophoresis method that allows protein separation by mass. The medium (also referred to as ′matrix′) is a polyacrylamide-based discontinuous gel. In addition, SDS ([[sodium dodecyl sulfate]]) is used. About 1.4 grams of SDS bind to a gram of protein,&lt;ref name="Reynolds"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Reynolds JA, [[Charles Tanford]] | title=Binding of dodecyl sulfate to proteins at high binding ratios.

SDS acts as a [[surfactant]], covering the proteins' intrinsic charge and conferring them very similar charge-to-mass ratios. The intrinsic charges of the proteins are negligible in comparison to the SDS loading, and the positive charges are also greatly reduced in the basic pH range of a separating gel. Upon application of a constant electric field, the protein migrate towards the anode, each with a different speed, depending on its mass. This simple procedure allows precise protein separation by mass.

SDS tends to form spherical [[micelle]]s in aqueous solutions above a certain concentration called the [[critical micellar concentration]] (CMC). Above the critical micellar concentration of 7 to 10 millimolar in solutions, the SDS simultaneously occurs as single molecules ([[monomer]]) and as micelles, below the CMC SDS occurs only as monomers in aqueous solutions. At the critical micellar concentration, a micelle consists of about 62 SDS molecules.&lt;ref name="TurroYekta1978"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Turro|first1=Nicholas J.|last2=Yekta|first2=Ahmad|title=Luminescent probes for detergent solutions.

Exceptions are e.g. proteins that were previously stabilised by covalent [[cross-link]]ing and the SDS-resistant protein complexes, which are stable even in the presence of SDS (the latter, however, only at room temperature). To denature the SDS-resistant complexes a high activation energy is required, which is achieved by heating. SDS resistance is based on a metastability of the protein fold. Although the native, fully folded, SDS-resistant protein does not have sufficient stability in the presence of SDS, the [[chemical equilibrium]] of denaturation at room temperature occurs slowly. Stable protein complexes are characterised not only by SDS resistance but also by stability against [[protease]]s and an increased [[biological half-life]].&lt;ref name="Manning"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Manning M, Colón W| title=Structural basis of protein kinetic stability: resistance to sodium dodecyl sulfate suggests a central role for rigidity and a bias toward beta-sheet structure. | journal=Biochemistry | year= 2004 | volume= 43 | issue= 35 | pages= 11248–54 | pmid=15366934 | doi=10.1021/bi0491898 | pmc= | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=15366934}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Procedure ==
The SDS-PAGE method is composed of gel preparation, sample preparation, electrophoresis, protein staining or [[western blot]]ting and analysis of the generated banding pattern.

=== Gel production ===
[[File:Electrophoresis gel combs 2.jpg|thumb|Sample combs with different numbers of pockets, each prong leaves a pocket in the gel when pulled out]]
[[File:Acrylamidgel.JPG|thumb|Polymerised separating and stacking gel before removing the sample comb (white) between the spacers (black), in the stacking gel are small amounts of bromophenol blue for improved visibility, the separating gel is unstained]]
When using different buffers in the gel (discontinuous gel electrophoresis), the gels are made up to one day prior to electrophoresis, so that the [[diffusion]] does not lead to a mixing of the buffers. The gel is produced by [[radical polymerisation]] in a mold consisting of two sealed glass plates with spacers between the glass plates. In a typical mini-gel setting, the spacers have a thickness of 0.75&amp;nbsp;mm or 1.5&amp;nbsp;mm, which determines the loading capacity of the gel. For pouring the gel solution, the plates are usually clamped in a stand which temporarily seals the otherwise open underside of the glass plates with the two spacers. For the gel solution, acrylamide is mixed as gel-former (usually 4% V/V in the stacking gel and 10-12 % in the separating gel), methylenebisacrylamide as a cross-linker, stacking or separating gel buffer, water and SDS. By adding the catalyst [[TEMED]] and the radical initiator [[ammonium persulfate]] (APS) the polymerisation is started. The solution is then poured between the glass plates without creating bubbles. Depending on the amount of catalyst and radical starter and depending on the temperature, the polymerisation lasts between a quarter of an hour and several hours. The lower gel (separating gel) is poured first and covered with a few drops of a barely water-soluble alcohol (usually buffer-saturated butanol or isopropanol), which eliminates bubbles from the [[Meniscus (liquid)|meniscus]] and protects the gel solution of the [[radical scavenger]] oxygen. After the polymerisation of the separating gel, the alcohol is discarded and the residual alcohol is removed with [[filter paper]]. After addition of APS and TEMED to the stacking gel solution, it is poured on top of the solid separation gel. Afterwards, a suitable sample comb is inserted between the glass plates without creating bubbles. The sample comb is carefully pulled out after polymerisation, leaving pockets for the sample application. For later use of proteins for [[protein sequencing]], the gels are often prepared the day before electrophoresis to reduce reactions of unpolymerised acrylamide with [[cysteine]]s in proteins.

By using a [[gradient mixer]], gradient gels with a gradient of acrylamide (usually from 4 to 12%) can be cast, which have a larger separation range of the molecular masses.&lt;ref name="Margolis"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Margolis J, Kenrick KG| title=2-dimensional resolution of plasma proteins by combination of polyacrylamide disc and gradient gel electrophoresis. | journal=Nature | year= 1969 | volume= 221 | issue= 5185 | pages= 1056–7 | pmid=5774398 | doi= 10.1038/2211056a0| pmc= | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=5774398}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial gel systems (so-called ''pre-cast gels'') usually use the buffer substance [[Bis-tris methane]] with a pH value between 6.4 and 7.2 both in the stacking gel and in the separating gel.&lt;ref name="HachmannAmshey2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hachmann|first1=John P.|last2=Amshey|first2=Joseph W.|title=Models of protein modification in Tris–glycine and neutral pH Bis–Tris gels during electrophoresis: Effect of gel pH|journal=Analytical Biochemistry|volume=342|issue=2|year=2005|pages=237–245|issn=0003-2697|doi=10.1016/j.ab.2005.04.015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WiltfangArold1991"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wiltfang|first1=Jens|last2=Arold|first2=Norbert|last3=Neuhoff|first3=Volker|title=A new multiphasic buffer system for sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of proteins and peptides with molecular masses 100 000-1000, and their detection with picomolar sensitivity|journal=Electrophoresis|volume=12|issue=5|year=1991|pages=352–366|issn=0173-0835|doi=10.1002/elps.1150120507}}&lt;/ref&gt; These gels are delivered cast and ready-to-use. Since they use only one buffer ([[continuous gel electrophoresis]]) and have a nearly neutral pH, they can be stored for several weeks. The more neutral pH slows the hydrolysis and thus the decomposition of the polyacrylamide. Furthermore, there are fewer acrylamide-modified cysteines in the proteins.&lt;ref name="HachmannAmshey2005"/&gt; Due to the constant pH in collecting and separating gel there is no stacking effect. Proteins in BisTris gels can not be stained with ruthenium complexes.&lt;ref name="MoebiusDenker2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moebius|first1=Jan|last2=Denker|first2=Katrin|last3=Sickmann|first3=Albert|title=Ruthenium (II) tris-bathophenanthroline disulfonate is well suitable for Tris-Glycine PAGE but not for Bis-Tris gels|journal=Proteomics|volume=7|issue=4|year=2007|pages=524–527|issn=1615-9853|doi=10.1002/pmic.200600642}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gel system has a comparatively large separation range, which can be varied by using [[MES (buffer)|MES]] or [[MOPS]] in the running buffer.&lt;ref name="HachmannAmshey2005"/&gt;

=== Sample preparation ===
[[File:Disulfide reduction by DTT-2.png|thumb|Disulfide reduction by DTT]]
During sample preparation, the sample buffer, and thus SDS, is added in excess to the proteins, and the sample is then heated to 95&amp;nbsp;°C for five minutes, or alternatively 70°C for ten minutes. Heating disrupts the [[secondary structure|secondary]] and [[tertiary structure]]s of the protein by disrupting [[hydrogen bond]]s and stretching the molecules. Optionally, [[disulfide bridge]]s can be cleaved by reduction. For this purpose, reducing [[thiol]]s such as [[β-mercaptoethanol]] (β-ME, 5% by volume), [[dithiothreitol]] (DTT, 10 millimolar) or [[dithioerythritol]] (DTE, 10 millimolar) are added to the sample buffer. After cooling to room temperature, each sample is pipetted into its own well in the gel, which was previously immersed in electrophoresis buffer in the electrophoresis apparatus.

In addition to the samples, a [[molecular-weight size marker]] is usually loaded onto the gel. This consists of proteins of known sizes and thereby allows the estimation (with an error of ± 10%) of the sizes of the proteins in the actual samples, which migrate in parallel in different tracks of the gel.&lt;ref name="Rosenberg2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ian M. Rosenberg|title=Protein Analysis and Purification: Benchtop Techniques|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gi-UgCF8G6EC&amp;pg=PA103|date=22 December 2006|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-0-8176-4412-3|pages=103–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The size marker is often pipetted into the first or last pocket of a gel.

=== Electrophoresis ===
[[File:Gelelektrophoreseapparatur.jpg|thumb|Electrophoresis chamber after a few minutes of electrophoresis. In the first pocket a size marker was applied with bromophenol blue, in the other pockets, the samples were added [[bromocresol green]]]]
For separation, the denatured samples are loaded onto a gel of polyacrylamide, which is placed in an electrophoresis buffer with suitable electrolytes. Thereafter, a [[voltage]] (usually around 100 V, 10-20 V per cm gel length) is applied, which causes a migration of negatively charged molecules through the gel in the direction of the positively charged [[anode]]. The gel acts like a sieve. Small proteins migrate relatively easily through the mesh of the gel, while larger proteins are more likely to be retained and thereby migrate more slowly through the gel, thereby allowing proteins to be separated by molecular size. The electrophoresis lasts between half an hour to several hours depending on the voltage and length of gel used.

The fastest-migrating proteins (with a molecular weight of less than 5 KDa) form the buffer front together with the anionic components of the electrophoresis buffer, which also migrate through the gel. The area of the buffer front is made visible by adding the comparatively small, anionic dye [[bromophenol blue]] to the sample buffer. Due to the relatively small molecule size of bromophenol blue, it migrates faster than proteins. By optical control of the migrating colored band, the electrophoresis can be stopped before the dye and also the samples have completely migrated through the gel and leave it.

The most commonly used method is the discontinuous SDS-PAGE. In this method, the proteins migrate first into a collecting gel with neutral pH, in which they are concentrated and then they migrate into a separating gel with basic pH, in which the actual separation takes place. Stacking and separating gels differ by different [[wiktionary:Pore|pore]] size (4-6 % T and 10-20 % T), [[ionic strength]] and [[pH value]]s (pH 6.8 or pH 8.8). The electrolyte most frequently used is an SDS-containing [[Tris]]-[[glycine]]-[[chloride]] [[Buffering agent|buffer]] system. At neutral pH, glycine predominantly forms the [[zwitterionic]] form, at high pH the glycines lose positive charges and become predominantly anionic. In the collection gel, the smaller, negatively charged chloride ions migrate in front of the proteins (as leading ions) and the slightly larger, negatively and partially positively charged glycinate ions migrate behind the proteins (as initial trailing ions), whereas in the comparatively basic separating gel both ions migrate in front of the proteins. The pH gradient between the stacking and separation gel buffers leads to a stacking effect at the border of the stacking gel to the separation gel, since the glycinate partially loses its slowing positive charges as the pH increases and then, as the former trailing ion, overtakes the proteins and becomes a leading ion, which causes the bands of the different proteins (visible after a staining) to become narrower and sharper - the stacking effect. For the separation of smaller proteins and peptides, the TRIS-[[Tricine]] buffer system of Schägger and von Jagow is used due to the higher spread of the proteins in the range of 0.5 to 50 KDa.&lt;ref name="Schäggervon Jagow1987"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schägger|first1=Hermann|last2=von Jagow|first2=Gebhard|title=Tricine-sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for the separation of proteins in the range from 1 to 100 kDa|journal=Analytical Biochemistry|volume=166|issue=2|year=1987|pages=368–379|issn=0003-2697|doi=10.1016/0003-2697(87)90587-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Analysis ===
Protein staining in the gel creates a documentable banding pattern of the various proteins. [[Glycoprotein]]s have differential levels of [[glycosylations]] and adsorb SDS more unevenly at the glycosylations, resulting in broader and blurred bands.&lt;ref name="Cryo"&gt;{{cite book|title=Cryo-EM Part A: Sample Preparation and Data Collection|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a1mPepNTgxcC&amp;pg=PA28|date=30 September 2010|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-08-095695-4|pages=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Membrane protein]]s, because of their [[transmembrane domain]], are often composed of the more hydrophobic amino acids, have lower [[solubility]] in aqueous solutions, tend to bind [[lipid]]s, and tend to precipitate in aqueous solutions due to [[hydrophobic effect]]s when sufficient amounts of detergent are not present. This precipitation manifests itself for membrane proteins in a SDS-PAGE in "tailing" above the band of the transmembrane protein. In this case, more SDS can be used (by using more or more concentrated sample buffer) and the amount of protein in the sample application can be reduced. An overloading of the gel with a soluble protein creates a semicircular band of this protein (e. g. in the marker lane of the image at 66 KDa), allowing other proteins with similar molecular weights to be covered. A low contrast (as in the marker lane of the image) between bands within a lane indicates either the presence of many proteins (low purity) or, if using purified proteins and a low contrast occurs only below one band, it indicates a proteolytic degradation of the protein, which first causes degradation bands, and after further degradation produces a homogeneous color ("smear") below a band.&lt;ref name="BurgessDeutscher2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard R Burgess|author2=Murray P. Deutscher|title=Guide to Protein Purification|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f6Lp4yna4hoC&amp;pg=PA184|date=3 November 2009|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-08-092317-8|pages=184–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The documentation of the banding pattern is usually done by photographing or scanning. For a subsequent recovery of the molecules in individual bands, a [[gel extraction]] can be performed.

=== Archiving ===
[[File:Gel_Blue_Coomassie.jpg|thumb|Two SDS gels after completed separation of the samples and staining in a drying frame]]
After protein staining and documentation of the banding pattern, the polyacrylamide gel can be dried for archival storage. Proteins can be extracted from it at a later date. The gel is either placed in a drying frame (with or without the use of heat) or in a vacuum dryer. The drying frame consists of two parts, one of which serves as a base for a wet [[cellophane]] film to which the gel and a one percent [[glycerol]] solution are added. Then a second wet cellophane film is applied bubble-free, the second frame part is put on top and the frame is sealed with clips. The removal of the air bubbles avoids a fragmentation of the gel during drying. The water evaporates through the cellophane film. In contrast to the drying frame, a vacuum dryer generates a vacuum and heats the gel to about 50&amp;nbsp;°C.

== Molecular mass determination ==

The relative mobility (called Rf value or Rm value) is the quotient of the distance of the band of the protein and the distance of the buffer front. The distances of the bands and the buffer front are each measured from the beginning of the separation gel. The distance of the buffer front roughly corresponds to the distance of the bromophenol blue contained in the sample buffer. The relative distances of the proteins of the size marker are plotted semi-logarithmically against their known molecular weights. By comparison with the linear part of the generated graph or by a regression analysis, the molecular weight of an unknown protein can be determined by its relative mobility.

== Applications ==
The SDS-PAGE in combination with a protein stain is widely used in biochemistry for the quick and exact separation and subsequent analysis of proteins. It has comparatively low instrument and reagent costs and is an easy-to-use method. Because of its low [[scalability]], it is mostly used for analytical purposes and less for preparative purposes, especially when larger amounts of a protein are to be isolated.

Additionally, SDS-PAGE is used in combination with the [[western blot]] for the determination of the presence of a specific protein in a mixture of proteins - or for the analysis of [[post-translational modification]]s. Post-translational modifications of proteins can lead to a different relative mobility (i.e. a ''band shift'') or to a change in the binding of a detection antibody used in the western blot (i.e. a band disappears or appears).

In [[mass spectrometry]] of proteins, SDS-PAGE is a widely used method for sample preparation prior to spectrometry, mostly using [[in-gel digestion]]. In regards to determining the molecular mass of a protein, the SDS-PAGE is a bit more exact than an analytical [[ultracentrifugation]], but less exact than a [[mass spectrometry]] or - ignoring post-translational modifications - a calculation of the protein molecular mass from the [[DNA sequence]].

In medical diagnostics, SDS-PAGE is used as part of the [[HIV test]] and to evaluate [[proteinuria]]. In the HIV test, HIV proteins are separated by SDS-PAGE and subsequently detected by Western Blot with HIV-specific [[antibodies]] of the patient, if they are present in his [[blood serum]]. SDS-PAGE for proteinuria evaluates the levels of various [[serum protein]]s in the urine, e.g. [[Albumin]], [[Alpha-2-macroglobulin]] and [[IgG]].

== Variants ==
SDS-PAGE is the most widely used method for gel electrophoretic separation of proteins. [[Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis]] sequentially combines [[isoelectric focusing]] or BAC-PAGE with a SDS-PAGE. [[Native PAGE]] is used if native protein folding is to be maintained. For separation of membrane proteins, BAC-PAGE or CTAB-PAGE may be used as an alternative to SDS-PAGE. For electrophoretic separation of larger protein complexes, [[agarose gel electrophoresis]] can be used, e.g. the [[SDD-AGE]]. Some [[enzyme]]s can be detected via their [[enzyme activity]] by [[zymography]].

== Alternatives ==
While being one of the more precise and low-cost protein separation and analysis methods, the SDS-PAGE denatures proteins. Where non-denaturing conditions are necessary, proteins are separated by a native PAGE or different [[chromatography|chromatographic]] methods with subsequent [[Photometry (optics)|photometric]] [[Quantification (science)|quantification]], for example [[affinity chromatography]] (or even [[tandem affinity purification]]), [[size exclusion chromatography]], [[ion exchange chromatography]].&lt;ref name="Janson2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jan-Christer Janson|title=Protein Purification: Principles, High Resolution Methods, and Applications|url=|date=3 January 2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-118-00219-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proteins can also be separated by size in a [[tangential flow filtration]]&lt;ref name="Desai2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mohamed A.

Some historically early and cost effective but crude separation methods usually based upon a series of [[Extraction (chemistry)|extractions]] and [[precipitation]]s using [[kosmotropic]] molecules, for example the [[ammonium sulfate precipitation]] and the [[polyethyleneglycol]] precipitation.

'''Scribal abbreviations''' or '''''sigla''''' ([[grammatical number|singular]]: '''''siglum''''') are the [[abbreviation]]s used by ancient and medieval scribes writing in [[Latin]], and later in [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Old Norse]]. In modern manuscript editing (substantive and mechanical) "sigla" are the symbols used to indicate the source manuscript (e.g. variations in text between different such manuscripts) and to identify the [[copyist]](s) of a work. See [[Critical apparatus]].

==History==
Abbreviated writing, using ''sigla'', arose partly from the limitations of the workable nature of the materials ([[rock (geology)|stone]], [[metal]], [[parchment]], etc.) employed in record-making and partly from their availability. Thus, [[lapidary|lapidaries]], [[engraver]]s, and [[copyist]]s made the most of the available writing space. Scribal abbreviations were infrequent when writing materials were plentiful, but by the 3rd and 4th centuries AD, writing materials were scarce and costly.

During the [[Roman Republic]], several abbreviations, known as ''sigla'' (plural of ''siglum'' = symbol or abbreviation), were in common use in inscriptions, and they increased in number during the [[Roman Empire]]. Additionally, in this period [[shorthand]] entered general usage. The earliest known Western shorthand system was that employed by the Greek historian [[Xenophon]] in the [[Memorabilia (Xenophon)|memoir of Socrates]], and it was called ''notae socratae''. In the late Roman Republic, the [[Tironian notes]] were developed possibly by [[Marcus Tullius Tiro]], Cicero's [[amanuensis]], in 63&amp;nbsp;BC to record information with fewer symbols; Tironian notes include a shorthand/syllabic alphabet notation different from the [[lower case|Latin minuscule hand]] and [[Roman square capitals|square]] and [[rustic capital]] letters. The notation was akin to modern [[stenographic]] writing systems. It used symbols for whole words or word roots and grammatical modifier marks, and it could be used to write either whole passages in shorthand or only certain words. In medieval times, the symbols to represent words were widely used; and the initial symbols, as few as 140 according to some sources, were increased to 14,000 by the [[Carolingians]], who used them in conjunction with other abbreviations. However, the alphabet notation had a "murky existence" (C. Burnett), as it was often associated with witchcraft and magic, and it was eventually forgotten. Interest in it was rekindled by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] [[Thomas Becket]] in the 12th century and later in the 15th century, when it was rediscovered by [[Johannes Trithemius]], abbot of the Benedictine abbey of Sponheim, in a psalm written entirely in Tironian shorthand and a Ciceronian lexicon, which was discovered in a Benedictine monastery (''notae benenses'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=King |first1=David |year=2000 |title=[[The Ciphers of the Monks|The ciphers of the Monks: a Forgotten Number-Notation of the Middle Ages]] |publisher=[[Franz Steiner Verlag]] |publication-place=[[Stuttgart]] |ISBN=978-3-5150-7640-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To learn the Tironian note system, scribes required formal schooling in some 4,000 symbols; this later increased to some 5,000 symbols and then to some 13,000 in the medieval period (4th to 15th centuries AD);&lt;ref name=Guenin1908 &gt;{{citation |last=Guénin |first=Louis-Prosper |year=1908 |title=Histoire de la sténographie dans l'antiquité et au moyen-âge; les notes tironiennes |last2=Guénin |first2=Eugène |publisher=Paris, Hachette et cie |language=French |oclc=301255530}}&lt;/ref&gt; the meanings of some characters remain uncertain. ''Sigla'' were mostly used in [[lapidary]] inscriptions; in some places and historical periods (such as medieval Spain) scribal abbreviations were overused to the extent that some are indecipherable.

==Forms==
The abbreviations were not constant but changed from region to region. Scribal abbreviations increased in usage and reached their height in the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] (8th to 10th centuries). The most common abbreviations, called ''notae communes'', were used across most of Europe, but others appeared in certain regions. In legal documents, legal abbreviations, called ''notae juris'', appear but also capricious abbreviations, which scribes manufactured ''ad hoc'' to avoid repeating names and places in a given document.&lt;ref&gt;Lindsay, Wallace Martin, ''Notae Latinae: An Account of Abbreviation in Latin Mss. Of the Early Minuscule Period (C. 700–850)'', 1915, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Scribal abbreviations can be found in epigraphy, sacred and legal manuscripts, written in Latin or in a vernacular tongue (but less frequently and with fewer abbreviations), either calligraphically or not.
[[File:Latin-breve.svg|frame|left|Latin abbreviations of {{lang|la|praedicatorum}}, {{lang|la|quoque}}, {{lang|la|conversis}}, and {{lang|la|quorum}}.]]{{Clear}}
In [[epigraphy]], common abbreviations were comprehended in two observed classes:
*The abbreviation of a word to its initial letter;
*The abbreviation of a word to its first consecutive letters or to several letters, from throughout the word.

Both forms of abbreviation are called "suspensions" (as the scribe suspends the writing of the word). A separate form of abbreviation is by "contraction" and was mostly a Christian usage for sacred words, [[Nomina Sacra]]; non-Christian sigla usage usually limited the number of letters the abbreviation comprised and omitted no intermediate letter. One practice was rendering an overused, formulaic phrase only as a siglum: DM for ''[[Manes|Dis Manibus]]'' ("Dedicated to the Manes"); [[Christogram|IHS]] from the first three letters of "[[Jesus|ΙΗΣΟΥΣ]]"; and RIP for ''[[requiescat in pace]]'' ("Rest in Peace") because the long-form written usage of the abbreviated phrase, by itself, was rare. According to Trabe, these abbreviations are not really meant to lighten the burden of the scribe but rather to shroud in reverent obscurity the holiest words of the Christian religion.&lt;ref&gt;Traube, Ludwig, Nomina sacra: Versuch einer Geschichte der Christlichen Kürzung, Munich,1907&lt;/ref&gt;

Another practice was repeating the abbreviation's final consonant a given number of times to indicate a group of as many persons: AVG denoted "Augustus", thus, AVGG denoted "Augusti duo"; however, lapidaries took typographic liberties with that rule, and instead of using COSS to denote "Consulibus duobus", they invented the CCSS form. Still, when occasion required referring to three or four persons, the complex doubling of the final consonant yielded to the simple plural siglum. To that effect, a ''[[vinculum (symbol)|vinculum]]'' (overbar) above a letter or a letter-set also was so used, becoming a universal medieval typographic usage. Likewise the ''[[tilde]]'' (~), an undulated, curved-end line, came into standard late-medieval usage.

Besides the ''tilde'' and [[macron (diacritic)|macron]] marks, above and below letters, modifying cross-bars and extended strokes were employed as scribal abbreviation marks, mostly for prefixes and verb, noun and adjective suffixes. The ''typographic'' abbreviations should not be confused with the ''phrasal'' abbreviations: '''''i.e.''''' (''id est'' — "that is"); '''''loc. cit.''''' (''loco citato'' — "in the passage already cited"); '''''viz.''''' (''vide licet'' — "namely", "that is to say", "in other words" — formed with "vi" and the ''[[yogh]]''-like glyph [Ꝫ], [ꝫ], the siglum for the suffix '''''-et''''' and the conjunction '''''et''''') and '''''et cetera'''''.

Moreover, besides scribal abbreviations, ancient texts also contained variant typographic characters, including [[typographic ligature|ligatures]] (e.g. '''Æ''', '''Œ''', etc.), the [[long s]] ('''ſ'''), and the [[half r]], resembling an Arabic numeral two ("2"). The "u" and "v" characters originated as scribal variants for their respective letters, likewise the "i" and "j" pair. Modern publishers printing Latin-language works replace variant typography and sigla with full-form Latin spellings; the convention of using "u" and "i" for vowels and "v" and "j" for consonants is a late typographic development.

===Scribal sigla in modern use===
====Latin script====
Some ancient and medieval sigla are still used in English and other European languages; the Latin [[ampersand]] (&amp;) replaces the conjunction ''and'' in English, ''et'' in Latin and French, and ''y'' in Spanish (but its use in Spanish is frowned upon, since the ''y'' is already smaller and easier to write). The Tironian sign '''⁊''', resembling the digit seven ("7"), represents the conjunction ''et'' and is written only to the [[x-height]]; in current [[Irish language]] usage, the siglum denotes the conjunction ''agus'' ("and"). Other scribal abbreviations in modern typographic use are the [[percentage]] sign ('''%'''), from the Italian ''per cento'' ("per hundred"); the [[permille]] sign ('''‰'''), from the Italian ''per mille'' ("per thousand"); the [[pound sign]] ('''₤''', '''£''' and '''#''', all descending from '''℔''' or '''lb''', ''librum'') and the [[dollar sign]] ('''$'''), which possibly derives from the Spanish word ''Peso''. The [[commercial at]] symbol ('''@'''), originally denoting "at the rate/price of", is a ligature derived from the English preposition ''at''; from the 1990s, its use outside commerce became widespread, as part of [[e-mail address]]es.

Typographically, the ampersand ("&amp;"), representing the word ''et'', is a space-saving [[ligature (typography)|ligature]] of the letters "e" and "t", its component [[graphemes]]. Since the establishment of movable-type printing in the 15th century, founders have created many such ligatures for each set of record type (font) to communicate much information with fewer symbols. Moreover, during the [[Renaissance]] (14th to 17th centuries), when [[Ancient Greek]] language [[Ancient Greek literature|manuscripts]] introduced that tongue to [[Western Europe]], its scribal abbreviations were converted to ligatures in imitation of the Latin scribal writing to which readers were accustomed. Later, in the 16th century, when the culture of publishing included Europe's vernacular languages, Graeco-Roman scribal abbreviations disappeared, an ideologic deletion ascribed to the anti-[[Latinist]] [[Protestant Reformation]] (1517–1648).

The common abbreviation "Xmas," for [[Christmas]], is a remnant of an old scribal abbreviation that substituted the [[Greek alphabet|Greek letter]] [[chi (letter)|chi]] (Χ, resembling Latin X and representing the first letter in the Greek word for Christ, Χριστος) for the word Christ.

====Church Slavonic====
[[File:ChurchSlavonicSigla.tiff|thumb|350px|right|Sigla frequently used in contemporary Church Slavonic]]
After the invention of printing, manuscript copying abbreviations continued to be employed in [[Church Slavonic language|Church Slavonic]] and are still in use in printed books as well as on icons and inscriptions. Many common long roots and nouns describing sacred persons are abbreviated and written under the special [[diacritic]] symbol [[titlo]], as shown in the figure at the right. That corresponds to the Nomina sacra (Latin: "Sacred names") tradition of using contractions for certain frequently-occurring names in [[Koine Greek|Greek]] ecclesiastical texts. However, sigla for personal nouns are restricted to "good" beings and the same words, when referring to "bad" beings, are spelled out; for example, while "God" in the sense of the one true God is abbreviated as "{{script/Slavonic|бг҃ъ}}", "god" referring to "false" gods is spelled out. Likewise, the word for "angel" is generally abbreviated as "{{script/Slavonic|агг҃лъ}}", but the word for "angels" is spelled out for "performed by evil angels" in Psalm 77.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gamanovich |first=Alipi |title=Grammatika Tserkovno-Slavyanskago Yazyka |publisher=Holy Trinity Monastery |origyear=1964|year=1984 |location=Jordanville, NY |page=271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abbreviation types==
Adriano Cappelli's ''Lexicon Abbreviaturarum'',&lt;ref&gt;Cappelli 2011 (first published 1899).&lt;/ref&gt; enumerates the various medieval brachigraphic signs found in Latin and Italian vulgar texts, which originate from the Roman sigla, a symbol to express a word, and Tironian notes. Quite rarely, abbreviations did not carry marks to indicate that an abbreviation has occurred: if they did, they were often [[scribal error|copying errors]]. For example, "e.g." is written with periods, but modern terms, such as "PC", may be written in uppercase.

It should be noted that the original manuscripts were not written in a modern sans-serif or serif font but in Roman capitals, rustic, uncial, insular, Carolingian or blackletter styles. For more, refer to [[Western calligraphy]] or a beginner's guide.&lt;ref&gt;The Calligrapher's Bible: 100 Complete Alphabets and How to Draw Them, David Harris, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the abbreviations employed varied across Europe. In Nordic texts, for instance, two [[runes]] were used in text written in the Latin alphabet, which are ᚠ for ''fé'' "cattle, goods" and ᛘ for ''maðr'' "man".

Cappelli divides abbreviations into six overlapping categories:
*by suspension (''troncamento'')
*by contraction (''contrazione'')
*with independent meaning (''con significato proprio'')
*with relative meaning (''con significato relativo'')
*by superscript letters (''per lettere sovrapposte'')
*by convention (''segni convenzionali'')

===Suspension===
[[File:Truncation spec example.svg|thumb|Examples for suspension type]]
Suspended terms are those of which only the first part is written, and the last part is substituted by a mark, which can be of two types:
; General: indicating there has been an abbreviation but not how. The marks are placed above or across the [[ascender (typography)|ascender]] of the letters.
:[[File:Truncation gen.svg|frameless|none|300px]]
: The final three of the series are knot-like and are used in papal or regal documents.
; Specific: indicating that a truncation has occurred.
:[[File:Truncation spec.svg|frameless|none|300px]]
:The third case is a stylistic alternative found in several fonts, here Andron ([http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/UA720.pdf Unicode chart extended D]).

The largest class of suspensions consists of single letters standing in for words that begin with that letter.

A dot at the baseline after a capital letter may stand for a title if it is used such as in front of names or a person's name in medieval legal documents. However, not all sigla use the beginning of the word.
[[File:Truncation example exceptions.svg|thumb|Exceptions: sigla not using the first letter of the abbreviated word|150px]]

For plural words, the siglum is often doubled: "F." = ''frater'' and "FF." = ''fratres''. Tripled sigla often stand for three: "DDD" = ''domini tres''.

Letters lying on their sides, or mirrored (backwards), often indicate female titles, but a mirrored C, Ↄ, stands generally for ''con'' or ''contra'' (the latter sometimes with a macron above, "Ↄ̄").

To avoid confusion with abbreviations and numerals, the latter are often written with a bar above. In some contexts, however, numbers with a line above indicate that number is to be multiplied by a thousand, and several other abbreviations also have a line above them, such as "ΧΡ" (Greek letters chi+rho) = ''Christus'' or "IHS" = ''Jesus''.

Starting in the 8th or the 9th century, single letter sigla grew less common and were replaced by longer, less-ambiguous sigla, with bars above them.

===Contraction===
Abbreviations by contraction have one or more middle letters omitted. They were often represented with a general mark of abbreviation (above), such as a line above. They can be divided into two subtypes:
; pure: a pure contraction keeps only the first (one or more) and last (one or more) letters but not intermediate letters. Special cases arise when a contraction keeps only the first and last letter of a word, resulting in a two-letter sigla.
; mixed (impure): a mixed contraction keeps one or more intermediate letters of the word that is abridged.

===Marks with independent meaning===
[[File:Indip abbr.svg|thumb|Examples of independent marks]]
Such marks inform the reader of the identity of the missing part of the word without affecting (''independent'' of) the meaning. Some of them may be interpreted as alternative contextual glyphs of their respective letters.
*The straight or curved macron above a letter means that an ''n'' or ''m'' is missing. A remnant can be seen in Spanish where an ''n'' with a tilde ([[ñ]]) is used for {{IPAblink|ɲ}}. In Visigoth texts before the 9th century, however, a dot is placed above the macron to indicate ''m'', and the same mark without a dot meant ''n''. The line with a dot became the general mark after the 9th century in Visigoth texts.
*A mark, resembling the [[Arabic numeral]] ''9'' or a mirrored ''C'' in Gothic texts, is one of the oldest signs and can be found in the texts of [[Marcus Valerius Probus]] and Tironian notes with the same meaning as ''con''.
*Another mark, similar to a bold comma or a superscript ''9'', placed after the letter on the median line, represented ''us'' or ''os'', generally at the end of the word, being the [[nominative case]] [[affix]] of the [[Latin declension#Second declension (0)|second declension]], sometimes ''is'' or simply ''s''. The [[apostrophe]] used today originated from various marks in sigla, which caused its current use in elision, such as in the [[Saxon genitive]].
*A wave-like or omicron-like mark stands for a missing ''r'' (rhotic consonant) or ''ra''. Sometimes, a similar wave-like mark at the end of a word indicated a missing ''-a'' or syllable ending in ''-a''. This is, however, a coincidence, as one of the marks stems from a small ''r''-like mark and the other from an ''a''-like one. In later texts, it became a [[diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] (two dots), or a broken line.
*A mark, resembling the Arabic numeral 2 and placed on the median line after the letter, indicates ''tur'' or ''ur'', which occurs generally at the end of the word. Alternatively it could stand for ''ter'' or ''er'' but not at the end of the word. (Nordic languages, such as Old English, have a lightning-bolt-like mark for words ending in ''er''.)
*The [[r rotunda]] with a cut generally stood for ''-rum'', but it could also stand for a truncation after the letter ''r''.
*A last mark, which could either be the Tironian note ⁊ or the [[ampersand]] &amp;, was used with equal frequency as the conjunction ''et'' (and) or as ''et'' in any part of the word. The symbol ⁊ at the end of a word indicates the enclitic ''-que'' (and). A corruption occurs in some manuscripts between it and the ''us''/''os'' mark.

===Marks with relative meaning===
[[File:Rel abbr.svg|thumb|Examples for relative marks]]
The meaning of the marks depends on the letter on which they appear.
*A macron not fully above the character but crossing the descender or ascender:
*: ''b̵'', ''b̄'' – ''bre-'', ''ber-'', ''-ub''
*: ''c̄'' (with a link on the right) – ''cum'', ''con'', ''cen-''
*: ꝯ̄ (above) –''quondam''
*: ''d̵'', ''d̄'' – ''de-'', ''der'', ''-ud'' (a crossed ''d'', not ''ð'' = [[eth]])
*: ''h̵'', ''h̄'' – ''haec'', ''hoc'', ''her''
*: ꝉ – ''vel'', ''ul-'', ''-el''
*: ''m̄'' (above) – ''mem-'', ''mun-''
*: ''n̄'' (above) – ''non'', ''nun-''
*: ''ꝋ'' (crossed horizontally, not [[Danish language|Danish]] ''ø'') – ''oblit''
*: ''p̱'' – ''per'', ''par-'', ''por-''
*: ''p̄'' (above) – ''prae'', ''pre-'' (alternatively, a mark similar to ''-us'' comma above but with a small spiral glyph could be used for this meaning, and it is also valid above the letter ''q'')
*: ''p̄p̄'' (above) or ''p̱p̱'' (below) – ''propter'', ''papa''
*: ''q̱'' – ''qui'' and, in Italy, ''que'', but in England ''quam'', ''quia''
*: ''q̄'' above – ''quae''
*: ''q̄q̄'' (above) or ''q̱q̱'' (below) – ''quoque''
*: ''q̱̃'' (tilde above and line below) – ''quam''
*: ''t̵'' – ''ter-'', ''tem-'', ''ten-''
*: ''ū'', ''v̄'' (above) – ''ven-'', ''ver'', ''-vit''
*A dot, two dots, comma and dot (different from a semicolon), and the Arabic numeral 3-like mark ꝫ were generally at the end of a word on the baseline. After ''b'', they mean ''-us'' (semicolon-like and ꝫ also could mean ''-et''). After ''q'', they form the conjunction ''-que'' (meaning "and" but attached to the end of the last word) with semicolon-like and ꝫ the ''q'' could be omitted. Semicolon-like, in Lombard documents, above ''s'' meant ''-sis''. The dot above median line on an ''h'' – ''hoc''. Dot above ''u'' – ''ut'' or ''uti''. The ꝫ could mean ''-est'', or after ''a'', ''e'', ''u'' vowels meant ''-m'' not ''us'' or ''ei'', if after an ''o'' it meant ''-nem''. In certain papers the ꝫ mark can be confused with a cut ''r'' rotunda (handwritten 4-like).
**A dot to the left and right of a letter gave the following meanings: ''e'' – ''.e.'' ''est'', ''i'' – ''.i.'' ''id est'', ''n'' – ''.n.'' ''enim'', ''q'' – ''.q.'' ''quasi'', ''s'' – ''.s.'' ''scilicet'', ''t'' – ''.t.'' ''tune'', .ꝯ. – ''quondam'', .⁊. ''etiam''.
*A diagonal line, often hooked, mark crossing nearly all the letters gives a different meaning. Commonly a missing ''er'', ''ar'', ''re''. Variants of which were placed above and were ¿-like&lt;!--rotated question mark--&gt;, tilde (crossing ascender) and similar to the ''us'' mark. These, used in various combinations, allow for various uses giving additional meanings.
*2-like mark, after a ''q'' – ''qꝛ'' ''quia''. After 15th century alone ꝛ ''et'' (being similar to ⁊) and alone with line above ꝛ̄ ''etiam''. After ''u'' and ''a'' at the end of a word (''uꝛ'', ''aꝛ'') ''m'', after ''s'' – ''sꝛ'', ''ſꝛ'' ''et'' or ''ed''.

===Stacked or superscript letters===
A superscript letter generally referred to the letter omitted, but, in some instances, as in the case of vowel letters, it could refer to a missing vowel combined with the letter ''r'', before or after it. It is only in some English dialects that the letter ''r'' before another consonant largely silent and the preceding vowel is "[[r-coloured]]".

However, ''a'', ''i'', and ''o'' above ''g'' meant ''gͣ'' ''gna'', ''gͥ'' ''gni'' and ''gͦ'' ''gno'' respectively. Although in English, the ''g'' is silent in ''[[gn (digraph)|gn]]'', but in other languages, it is pronounced. Vowel letters above ''q'' meant ''qu'' + vowel: ''qͣ'', ''qͤ'', ''qͥ'', ''qͦ'', ''qͧ''.

*''a'' on ''r'': ''rͣ'' – ''regula''
*''o'' on ''m'': ''mͦ'' – ''modo''

Vowels were the most common superscripts, but consonants could be placed above letters without ascenders; the most common were ''c'', e.g. ''nͨ''. A cut ''l'' above an ''n'', ''nᷝ'', meant ''nihil'' for instance.

===Convention marks===
These marks are nonalphabetic letters carrying a particular meaning. Several of them continue in modern usage, as in the case of monetary symbols. In Unicode, they are referred to as ''letter-like glyphs''. Additionally, several authors are of the view that the Roman numerals themselves were, for example, nothing less than abbreviations of the words for those numbers. Other examples of symbols still in some use are [[alchemical symbol|alchemical]] and [[zodiac]] symbols, which were, in any case, employed only in alchemy and astrology texts, which made their appearance beyond that special context rare.

==Other==
{{See also|Palaeography|Illuminated manuscript |Typographic ligature|Breviograph}}
In addition to the signs used to signify abbreviations, medieval manuscripts feature some glyphs that are now uncommon but were not sigla.
Many more [[typographic ligature|ligatures]] were used to reduce the space occupied, a characteristic that is particularly prominent in blackletter scripts.
Some [[:Category:Palaeographic letter variants|letter variants]] such as [[r rotunda]], [[long s]] and uncial or insular variants ([[Insular G]]), [[Claudian letters]] were in common use, as well as letters derived from other scripts such as Nordic runes: [[thorn (letter)|thorn (þ=th)]] and [[eth (letter)|eth (ð=dh)]].
An [[illuminated manuscript]] would feature [[miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]], [[initial|decorated initials]] or ''littera notabilior'', which later resulted in the [[letter case#Bicameral script|bicamerality]] of the script (case distinction).

==Typographic replication==
[[File:Domesday Croydon Cheam.jpg|thumb|right|Entries for [[Croydon]] and [[Cheam]], [[Surrey]], in [[Domesday Book]] (1086), as published using [[record type]] in 1783.]]
Various [[typeface]]s have been designed to allow scribal abbreviations and other archaic glyphs to be replicated in print. They include "[[record type]]", which was first developed in the 1770s to [[publication of Domesday Book|publish Domesday Book]] and was fairly widely used for the publication of medieval records in Britain until the end of the 19th century.

===Unicode encoding===
{{Main|Medieval Unicode Font Initiative}}
In the [[Unicode]] Standard [https://web.archive.org/web/20090127061209/http://unicode.org/press/pr-5.1.html v. 5.1] (4 April 2008), 152 medieval and classical glyphs were given specific locations outside of the Private Use Area. Specifically, they are located in the charts [http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1DC0.pdf "Combining Diacritical Marks Supplement"] (26 characters), [http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1E00.pdf "Latin Extended Additional"] (10 characters), [http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2E00.pdf "Supplemental Punctuation"] (15 characters), [http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U10190.pdf "Ancient Symbols"] (12 characters) and especially [http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/UA720.pdf "Latin Extended-D"] (89 characters).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.hit.uib.no/mufi/ |title= MUFI: Medieval Unicode Font Initiative |date= 15 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These consist in both precomposed characters and modifiers for other characters, called combining diacritical marks (such as writing in [[LaTeX]] or using [https://support.microsoft.com/kb/211642 overstrike] in MS Word).

Characters are "the smallest components of written language that have semantic value" but glyphs are "the shapes that characters can have when they are rendered or displayed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://unicode.org/ |title= The Unicode Consortium |publisher= Unicode, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:No Thumbtacks.jpg|thumb|300px]]'''Self-referential humor''', also known as '''self-reflexive humor''' or '''meta humor''', is a type of [[Expression (language)|comedic expression]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.vo.lu/homepages/phahn/humor/self_ref.htm |title=Sentences about Self-Reference and Recurrence |publisher=.vo.lu |date= |accessdate=2012-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; that—either directed toward some other subject, or openly directed toward itself—intentionally [[allude]]s to the very person who is expressing the [[humor]] in a comedic fashion, or to some specific aspect of that same comedic expression.  Self-referential humor expressed discreetly and [[surreal humor|surrealistically]] is a form of [[bathos]]. In general, self-referential humor often uses [[hypocrisy]], [[oxymoron]], or [[paradox]] to create a contradictory or otherwise absurd situation that is humorous to the audience.&lt;ref&gt;[[Self referential humor]]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Self-referential humor is sometimes combined with breaking the [[fourth wall]] to explicitly make the reference directly to the audience, or make self-reference to an element of the medium that the characters should not be aware of.

[[Old Comedy]] of Classical Athens is held to be the first—in the extant sources—form of self-referential comedy. [[Aristophanes]], whose plays form the only remaining fragments of Old Comedy, used fantastical plots, grotesque and inhuman masks and status reversals of characters to slander prominent politicians and court his audience's approval.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Hughes; ''Performing Greek Comedy'' (Cambridge, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

[[RAS syndrome]] refers to the redundant use of one or more of the words that make up an [[acronym]] or initialism with the abbreviation itself, thus in effect repeating one or more words. However, "RAS" stands for '''R'''edundant '''A'''cronym '''S'''yndrome; therefore, the full phrase yields "Redundant Acronym Syndrome syndrome" and is self-referencing in a comical manner.  It also reflects an excessive use of [[Three-letter acronym|TLA]]s ('''T'''hree '''L'''etter '''A'''cronyms).

[[Meta]] has come to be used, particularly in art, to refer to something that is self-referential. Popularised by [[Douglas Hofstadter]] who wrote several books on himself and the subject of self-reference, [[meta-joke]]s are a popular form of humor.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7857">[[Image:theaetetus stephanus page142.jpg|thumb|Volume 1, Page 142 of the 1578 Stephanus edition of Plato, showing the opening of ''Theaetetus'']]

'''Stephanus pagination''' is a system of reference and organization used in modern editions and translations of [[Plato]] (and less famously, [[Plutarch]]) based on the three volume 1578 edition&lt;ref&gt;''Platonis opera quae extant omnia'' edidit Henricus Stephanus, Genevae, 1578.&lt;/ref&gt; of Plato's complete works translated by Joannes Serranus ([[Jean de Serres]]) and published by Henricus Stephanus ([[Henri Estienne]]) in [[Geneva]].

==Overview==
In the case of Plato's works, Stephanus pagination first divides the works into numbers that are the page numbers of each of the Stephanus edition's three volumes, and each such page and page number is further subdivided into lettered sections which correspond to parallel Greek/Latin translated passages on a given page, mostly commonly a, b, c, d, and e.  This system is used in modern scholarship to cite Plato.  For Plato's works, unique coordinates for a passage can therefore be given with three pieces of information: the work's name, the (Stephanus) page number, and the letter denoting the passage.  For example, "''Symposium'' 172a" cites ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'', Stephanus page 172 (the volume in which ''Symposium'' occurs, as it happens, volume 3), passage a.  To avoid ambiguity in this scheme, either the Platonic work or the volume must be cited; absent this, "page 50" might refer to any of the "pages 50" across Stephanus' three volumes.  Reference to Stephanus manifestly presupposes the existing ordering of the work in its given volumes, but given historical disagreement as to the chronology and proper ordering of Plato's works, care should therefore be taken when referring to Stephanus pagination as opposed to another scheme.

More specific citations may add line numbers, e.g. ''Symposium'' 209a5–9, but these generally refer to the lines in [[John Burnet (classicist)|John Burnet]]'s [[Oxford Classical Text]], not to Estienne's line divisions.

There are some peculiarities in the Stephanus page numbers. The length of each page and each paragraph can vary if extra commentary appears on the page of the 1578 edition. Thus Stephanus pages are not all of the same length. Some pages do not have all the paragraphs a through e. There are also gaps in the sequence of Stephanus page numbers for Plato's ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' and ''[[Laws (dialogue)|Laws]]''. The reason is that the editors added separate introductions to each 'book' of these longer works, and thus the page numbers of these introductions are not used to refer to pages in Plato's dialogues. 

The spurious dialogue ''[[Halcyon (dialogue)|Halcyon]]'' was included in the corpus of [[Lucian]]'s works and does not have Stephanus numbers.

[[Bekker numbering]] is the comparable system for the works of [[Aristotle]], and [[Diels–Kranz numbering]] is the comparable system for [[Pre-Socratic philosophy]].  Unlike Stephanus pagination, Bekker numbering starts with page 1 and proceeds through all of Aristotle's works without starting over, regardless of the number of volumes needed for a given edition.  Bekker numbering therefore has the advantage, not shared by Stephanus pagination, of giving compact, unambiguous numerical citation of a given passage, page, etc, without the absolute necessity in order to avoid ambiguity to specify the dialogue, work or volume which exists in the case of Stephanus.

The '''Stumpers-L''' [[electronic mailing list]], was a resource available for [[librarian]]s and others to discuss reference questions which they were unable to answer using available resources. It was succeeded by the similar '''Project Wombat.'''

== Origins ==

Stumpers-L began in 1992, created by Ann Feeney, a [[library school]] graduate student at [[Rosary College]] in [[River Forest, Illinois|River Forest]], [[Illinois]], in the [[United States]]. It was moved to [[Concordia University, Chicago]], then back to Rosary, which was then renamed [[Dominican University of Illinois|Dominican University]]. From 2002 to 2005 it was maintained by the Dominican University Graduate School of Library and Information Science program.  At the end of 2005 Dominican University ceased hosting the list. A replacement list, known as Project Wombat, commenced in January 2006, and is hosted by [[Project Gutenberg]].

Originally the Stumpers-L archive was a [[gopher protocol|gopher]] resource, but migrated to the [[World Wide Web]] once the web became more universally used in the mid-1990s.

== Topics ==

Typical Stumpers-L topics include:
*"Which words in the [[English language]] end in [[-gry]]?"
*"Who wrote ''[[The Book of Counted Sorrows]]'', and where can I get a copy?"
*"Is there a novel with [[lipogram|no letter 'e']] in it?"
*"Where can I find information on [[Kombucha]]/Manchurian Mushroom Tea?"
*"If the average [[human body]] were broken down into its constituent chemicals, how much would they be worth?"

{{selfref|For Wikipedia's policy on the use of tertiary sources, see [[WP:TERTIARY]].}}
{{Distinguish|Tertiary sector}}
A '''tertiary source''' is an index or textual consolidation of [[Primary source|primary]] and [[secondary source]]s.&lt;ref name="umd"&gt; [http://www.lib.umd.edu/ues/guides/primary-sources Primary, secondary and tertiary sources.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703015116/http://www.lib.umd.edu/ues/guides/primary-sources |date=2013-07-03 }}". University Libraries, University of Maryland. Retrieve 07/26/2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.odu.edu/genedinfolit/1infobasics/tertiary_information_sources.html|title=Tertiary Information Sources|date=September 2012|publisher=Old Dominion University -- ODU Libraries|accessdate=20 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JCU&gt;"[http://libguides.jcu.edu.au/tertiary Tertiary sources]". James Cook University.&lt;/ref&gt; Some tertiary sources are not to be used for academic [[research]], unless they can also be used as secondary sources, or to find other sources.&lt;ref name=newhaven&gt;"[http://libguides.newhaven.edu/content.php?pid=465151&amp;sid=3809011 Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Resources]". University of New Haven.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overlap with secondary sources==
Depending on the topic of research, a scholar may use a [[bibliography]], [[dictionary]], or [[encyclopedia]] as either a tertiary or a secondary source.&lt;ref name="umd"&gt; [http://www.lib.umd.edu/ues/guides/primary-sources Primary, secondary and tertiary sources.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703015116/http://www.lib.umd.edu/ues/guides/primary-sources |date=2013-07-03 }}". University Libraries, University of Maryland. Retrieve 07/26/2013&lt;/ref&gt; This causes difficulty in defining many sources as either one type or the other.

In some [[academic discipline]]s the differentiation between a secondary and tertiary source is relative.&lt;ref name="umd"/&gt;&lt;ref name=JCU /&gt; 

In the [[UNISIST model|United Nations International Scientific Information System (UNISIST) model]], a secondary source is a bibliography, whereas a tertiary source is a synthesis of primary sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Søndergaard | first1 = T. F. | last2 = Andersen | first2 = J. | last3 = Hjørland | first3 = B. | doi = 10.1108/00220410310472509 | title = Documents and the communication of scientific and scholarly information: Revising and updating the UNISIST model | journal = Journal of Documentation | volume = 59 | issue = 3 | pages = 278 | year = 2003 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of tertiary sources==
As tertiary sources, encyclopedias, [[textbook]]s, and [[compendium|compendia]] attempt to summarize, collect, and consolidate the source materials into an overview, but may also present subjective, or biased commentary and analysis (which are characteristics of secondary sources).

[[Bibliographic index|Indexes]], bibliographies, [[Concordance (publishing)|concordances]], and [[Database#Research|databases]] may not provide much textual information, but as aggregates of primary and secondary sources, they are often considered tertiary sources. So although tertiary sources are both primary and secondary, they are more towards a secondary source because of commentary and bias.

[[Almanac]]s, [[guide book|travel guides]], [[field guide]]s, and [[timeline]]s are also examples of tertiary sources.

Survey or overview articles are usually tertiary, though [[review articles]] in peer-reviewed [[academic journals]] are secondary (not be confused with film, book, etc. [[review]]s, which are primary-source opinions).

Some usually primary sources, such as [[User guide|user guides and manuals]], are secondary or tertiary (depending on the nature of the material) when written by third parties.

'''Text Annotation''' is the practice and the result of adding a note or [[gloss (annotation)|gloss]] to a text, which may include highlights or underlining, comments, footnotes, tags, and links. Text annotations can include notes written for a reader's private purposes, as well as shared annotations written for the purposes of collaborative writing and [[Collaborative editing|editing]], commentary, or social reading and sharing. In some fields, text annotation is comparable to metadata insofar as it is added post hoc and provides information about a text without fundamentally altering that original text.&lt;ref name= "Shabjee and Reynolds"&gt;{{cite web|last=Shabajee|first=P. and D. Reynolds|title=What is Annotation? A Short Review of Annotation and Annotation Systems|url=http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/publications/researchreport/rr1053/report_html?ilrtyear=2003|work=ILRT Research Report No. 1053|publisher=Institute for Learning &amp; Research Technology|accessdate=March 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Text annotations are sometimes referred to as [[marginalia]], though some reserve this term specifically for hand-written notes made in the margins of books or manuscripts. Annotations are extremely useful and help to develop knowledge of English literature.

This article covers both private and socially shared text annotations, including hand-written and information technology-based annotation. For information on annotation of Web content, including images and other non-textual content, see also [[Web annotation]].

== History ==

Text annotation may be as old as writing on media, where it was possible to produce an additional copy with a reasonable effort. It became a prominent activity around 1000 AD in [[Talmud#Commentaries|Talmudic commentaries]] and Arabic rhetorics treaties. In the Medieval era, scribes who copied manuscripts often made marginal annotations that then circulated with the manuscripts and were thus shared with the community; sometimes annotations were copied over to new versions when such manuscripts were later recopied.&lt;ref name="Wolfe and Neuwirth"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wolfe,|first=Joanna|author2=Christine M. Neuwirth |title=From the Margins to the Center: The Future of Annotation|journal=Journal of Business and Technical Communication|year=2001|volume=15|issue=33|pages=333–370|doi=10.1177/105065190101500304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the rise of the [[printing press]] and the relative ease of circulating and purchasing individual (rather than shared) copies of texts, the prevalence of socially shared annotations declined and text annotation became a more private activity consisting of a reader interacting with a text.&lt;ref name="Wolfe and Neuwirth" /&gt; Annotations made on shared copies of texts (such as library books) are sometimes seen as devaluing the text, or as an act of defacement. Thus, print technologies support the circulation of annotations primarily as formal scholarly commentary or [[Footnotes|textual footnotes or endnotes]] rather than marginal, handwritten comments made by private readers, though handwritten comments or annotations were common in collaborative writing or editing.&lt;ref name="Wolfe and Neuwirth" /&gt;

Computer-based technologies have provided new opportunities for individual and socially shared text annotations that support multiple purposes, including readers’ individual reading goals, [[learning]], social [[Reading (process)|reading]], [[writing]] and [[editing]], and other practices.  Text annotation in Information Technology (IT) systems raises technical issues of access, linkage, and [[Computer data storage|storage]] that are generally not relevant to paper-based text annotation, and thus research and development of such systems often addresses these areas.&lt;ref name="Shabjee and Reynolds"/&gt;

== Functions and Applications ==

Text annotations can serve a variety of functions for both private and public reading and communication practices. In their article "From the Margins to the Center: The Future of Annotation," scholars Joanna Wolfe and Christine Neuwirth identify four primary functions that text annotations commonly serve in the modern era, including: (1)"facilitat[ing] reading and later writing tasks," which includes annotations that support reading for both personal and professional purposes; (2)"eavesdrop[ping] on the insights of other readers," which involves sharing of annotations; (3)"provid[ing] feedback to writers or promote communication with collaborators," which can include personal, professional, and education-related feedback; and (4)"call[ing] attention to topics and important passages," for which scholarly annotations, footnotes, and call-outs often function.&lt;ref name = "Wolfe and Neuwirth"/&gt; Regarding the ways that annotations can support individual reading tasks, Catherine Marshall points out that the ways that readers annotate texts depends on the purpose, [[motivation]], and context of reading. Readers may annotate to help interpret a text, to call attention to a section for future reference or reading, to support [[memory]] and recall, to help focus attention on the text as they read, to work out a problem related to the text, or create annotations not specifically related to the text at all.&lt;ref name=MarshallReadWriteElectronicBook&gt;{{cite book|last=Marshall|first=Catherine|title=Reading and Writing the Electronic Book|journal=Synthesis Lectures on Information Concepts, Retrieval, and Services|volume=1|year=2010|publisher=Morgan &amp; Claypool|location=UNC Chapel Hill|pages=38–51|url=http://www.morganclaypool.com/doi/pdf/10.2200/S00215ED1V01Y200907ICR009|doi=10.2200/S00215ED1V01Y200907ICR009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Educational applications ===

Educational research in text annotation has examined the role that both private and shared text annotations can play in supporting learning goals and [[communication]]. Much educational research examines how students’ private annotation of texts supports [[Reading comprehension|comprehension]] and memory; for example, research indicates that annotating texts causes more in-depth processing of information, which results in greater recall of information.&lt;ref name="Wolfe and Neuwirth" /&gt;

Other areas of educational research investigate the benefits of socially shared text annotations for [[collaborative learning]], both for paper-based and IT-based annotation sharing. For example, studies by Joanna Wolfe have investigated the benefits of exposure to others’ annotations on student readers and writers. In a 2000 study, Wolfe found that exposing students to others’ annotations influenced their perceptions of the annotators, which in turn shaped their responses to the material and their written products.&lt;ref name="Wolfe, Effects"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wolfe|first=Joanna|title=Effects of Annotations on Student Readers and Writers|journal=Proceedings of the fifth ACM conference on Digital libraries|year=2000|pages=19–26|doi=10.1145/336597.336620|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=336620|isbn=158113231X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a later study, Wolfe found that viewing others’ written comments on a paper text, especially pairs of annotations that present opposing responses to the text, can help students engage in the type of [[critical reading]] and stance-taking necessary for effective [[Argumentation|argumentative writing]].&lt;ref name="Wofe AnnoandCollabDigitalLib" /&gt;

While shared annotations can benefit individual readers, it is important to note that, "since the 1920s, [[literacy]] theory has increasingly emphasized the importance of social factors in the development of literacy."&lt;ref name=KaplanChisikInTheCompanyOfReaders /&gt;  Thus, shared annotations can not only help one to better understand the content of a particular text, but may also aid in the acquirement of literacy skills. For example, a mother may leave marks inside a book to draw the attention of her child to a particular theme or concept; thanks to the development of audio annotations, parents may now leave notes for children who are just starting to read and may struggle with textual annotations.&lt;ref name=KaplanChisikInTheCompanyOfReaders&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kaplan|first=Nancy|author2=Yoram Chisik |title=In the Company of Readers: The Digital Library Book as "Practiced Place"|journal=Proceedings of the 5th ACM/IEEE-CS joint conference on Digital libraries|year=2005|pages=235–243|doi=10.1145/1065385.1065439|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1065439|isbn=1581138768}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent research in the effects of shared text annotations has focused on the learning applications for web-based annotation systems, some of which were developed based on design recommendations from studies outlined above. For example, Ananda Gunawardena, Aaron Tan, and David Kaufer conducted a pilot study to examine whether annotating documents in Classroom Salon, a web-based annotation and social reading platform, encouraged active reading, error detection, and collaboration in a computer science course at [[Carnegie Mellon University]]. This study suggested a correlation between students’ overall performance in the course and their ability to identify errors in a text that they annotated in Classroom Salon; it also found that students were likely to change their annotations in response to annotations made by others in the course.&lt;ref name=GunaTanKauferEncouragingReadingandCollaboration&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gunawardena|first=Ananda|author2=Aaron Tan |author3=David Kaufer |title=Encouraging Reading and Collaboration Using Classroom Salon|journal=Proceedings of the Fifteenth Annual Conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education|year=2010|pages=254–258|doi=10.1145/1822090.1822162|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1822162&amp;dl=ACM&amp;coll=DL&amp;CFID=90744943&amp;CFTOKEN=38262707|isbn=9781605587295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, the web-based annotation tool HyLighter was used in a first-year writing course and shown to improve the development of students’ mental models of texts, including supporting reading comprehension, [[critical thinking]], and the ability to develop a thesis. The collaboration with peers and experts around a shared text improved these skills and brought the communities’ understanding closer together.&lt;ref name="Mendenhall et all Implementation of an Online Social Annotation Tool"&gt;{{cite book|title=Multiple Perspectives on Problem Solving and Learning in the Digital Age.|publisher=Springer|location=New York|pages=313–323|author=Mendenhall, A. |author2=C. Kim |author3=T.E. Johson|editor=D. Ifenthaler |editor2=P. Isaias |editor3=J.M. Spector |editor4=K. D.G. Sampson|chapter=Implementation of an Online Social Annotation Tool in a College English Course.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A meta-analysis of empirical studies into the higher-education uses of social annotation (SA) tools indicates such tools have been tested in several courses, among them [[English studies|English]], [[sport psychology]], and [[hypermedia]]. Studies have indicated that social annotation functions, including commenting, information sharing, and highlighting, can support instruction designed to foster collaborative learning and communication, as well as reading comprehension, [[metacognition]], and critical analysis. Several studies indicated that students enjoyed using social annotation tools, and that it improved motivation in the course.&lt;ref name="Novak et al Educaitonal Uses of Social Annotation Tools"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Novak|first=Elena |author2=Rim Razzouk |author3=Tristan E. Johnson|title=The Educational Uses of Social Annotation Tools in Higher Education: A Literature Review|journal=Internet and Higher Education|year=2012|volume=15|pages=39–49|url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ947876&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ947876|doi=10.1016/j.iheduc.2011.09.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Writing and text-centered collaboration ===

Text annotations have long been used in writing and revision processes as a way for reviewers to suggest changes and communicate about a text.&lt;ref name="Wolfe and Neuwirth" /&gt; In book publishing, for example, the collaboration of authors and editors to develop and revise a manuscript frequently involves exchanges of both in-line revisions or notes as well as marginal annotations. Similarly, copyeditors often make marginal annotations or notes that explain or suggest revisions or are directed at the author as questions or suggestions (commonly called "queries").&lt;ref name=Einsohn&gt;{{cite book|last=Einsohn|first=Emily|title=The Copyeditor's Handbook|year=2000|publisher=University of California Press|location=London, England|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_copyeditor_s_handbook.html?id=qv1p2RYbpY0C|isbn=9780520218352}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asynchronous collaborative writing and document development often depend on text annotations as a way not only to suggest revisions but also to exchange ideas during document development or to facilitate group decision making, though such processes are often complicated by the use of different communication technologies (such as phone calls or emails as well as document sharing) for distinct tasks.&lt;ref name="Weng and Gennari"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weng|first=Chuhnua|author2=John H. Gennari |title=Asynchronous Collaborative Writing Through Annotations|journal=Proceedings of the 2004 ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work '04|year=2004|volume=6|issue=3|pages=578–581|doi=10.1145/1031607.1031705|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1031607.1031705}}&lt;/ref&gt; Text annotations can also function to allow group or community members to communicate about a shared text, such as a doctor annotating a patient's chart.&lt;ref name="Wolfe and Neuwirth" /&gt;

Much research into the functionality and design of collaborative IT-based writing systems, which often support text annotation, has occurred in the area of [[computer-supported cooperative work]].&lt;ref name="Rodriguez and Eklundh"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rodriguez|first=Henry|author2=Kerstin Severinson Eklundh |title=Visualizing Patterns of Annotation in Document-Centered Collaboration on the Web|journal=Studies in Writing: Vol. 17 Writing and Digital Media|year=2005|pages=131–143|editor1-first=L. |editor1-last=Van Waes |editor2-first=M. |editor2-last=Leijten |editor3-first=C. |editor3-last=Neuwirth |others=G. Rijlaardsdam (Series Ed.)|publisher=Elsevier|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure and Design ==

Research in the design and development of annotation systems uses specific terminology to refer to distinct structural components of annotations and also distinguishes among options for digital annotation displays.

===Annotation structure===
The structural components of any annotation can be roughly divided into three primary elements: a ''body'', an ''anchor'', and a ''marker''. The body of an annotation includes reader-generated [[symbols]] and text, such as handwritten commentary or stars in the margin. The anchor is what indicates the extent of the original text to which the body of the annotation refers; it may include circles around sections, brackets, highlights, underlines, and so on. Annotations may be anchored to very broad stretches of text (such as an entire document) or very narrow sections (such as a specific letter, word, or phrase). The marker is the visual appearance of the anchor, such as whether it is a grey underline or a yellow highlight. An annotation that has a body (such as a comment in the margin) but no specific anchor has no marker.&lt;ref name=MarshallReadWriteElectronicBook /&gt;

===Annotation display types===
IT-based annotation systems utilize a variety of display options for annotations, including:
* Footnote interfaces that display annotations below the corresponding text
* Aligned annotations that display comments and notes vertically in the text margins, sometimes in multiple columns or as a "sidebar" layer
* Interlinear annotations that attach annotations directly into a text
* Sticky note interfaces, where annotations appear in popup dialogs over the source text
* Voice annotations, in which reviewers record annotations and embed them within a document
* Pen or digital-ink based interfaces that allow writing directly on a document or screen
Annotation interfaces may also allow highlighting or underlining, as well as threaded discussions.&lt;ref name="Wolfe and Neuwirth" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wolfe Annotation Technologies"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wolfe|first=Joanna|title=Annotation Technologies: A software and Research Review|journal=Computers and Composition|year=2002|volume=19|issue=4|pages=471–497|doi=10.1016/s8755-4615(02)00144-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sharing and communicating through annotations anchored to specific documents is sometimes referred to as ''anchored discussion''.&lt;ref name="Wofe AnnoandCollabDigitalLib"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wolfe|first=Joanna|title=Annotations and the Collaborative Digital Library: Effects of an Aligned Annotion Interface on Student Argumentation and Reading Strategies|journal=Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning|date=Jun 2008|volume=3|issue=2|pages=141–164|url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ851577&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ851577|doi=10.1007/s11412-008-9040-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== IT-based text annotation systems ==

IT-based annotation systems include [[Computer software|standalone]] and [[Client-server model|client-server systems]]. In the 1980s and 1990s, a number of such systems were built in the context of [[Library|libraries]], [[patent office]]s, and legal text processing. Their design led researchers to produce [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomies]] of annotation forms.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, Catherine C.: [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=263806 Annotation: from paper books to the digital library], Proceedings of the ACM Digital Libraries '97 Conference, Philadelphia, PA.&lt;/ref&gt; Text annotation research has taken place at several institutions, including Xerox research centers in [[PARC (company)|Palo Alto]] and Grenoble (France), the Hitachi Central Research Lab (in particular for annotation of patents), and in relation with the construction of the new French National Library between 1989 and 1995&lt;ref&gt;Virbel, Jacques, Reading and managing texts on the Bibliothèque de France station, The digital word: text-based computing in the humanities book contents, MIT Press 1993, Cambridge, USA, pp 31-51.&lt;/ref&gt; at the Institut de Recherche en Informatique de Toulouse and in the company AIS (Advanced Innovation Systems).

Annotation functionality has been present in text processing software for many years through inline notes displayed as pop-ups, footnotes, and endnotes; however, it is only recently that functionality for displaying annotations as marginalia has appeared in programs such as [[OpenOffice.org]]/[[LibreOffice]] Writer and [[Microsoft Word]]. Personal or standalone annotation include word processing software that supports embedded or anchored text annotations as well as [[Adobe Acrobat]], which in addition to commenting allows highlights, stamps, and other types of markup.&lt;ref name="Shabjee and Reynolds" /&gt;

=== Web-based text annotation systems ===
{{main|Web annotation}}
[[Tim Berners-Lee]] had already implemented the concept&lt;ref name="boulton"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital-archaeology.org/the-nexus-browser/|title=The Nexus Browser|last=Boulton|first=Jim|date=26 March 2014|accessdate=21 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; of directly editing web documents in 1990 in [[WorldWideWeb]], the first web browser,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Berners-Lee|first=Tim|title=A Brief History of the Web|url=http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/TimBook-old/History.html|publisher=[[World Wide Web Consortium]]|accessdate=21 September 2014|authorlink=Tim Berners-Lee|year=1993–1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; but later ported versions removed this collaborative ability.&lt;ref name="boulton"/&gt; An early version of [[Mosaic (web browser)|NCSA Mosaic]] in 1993 also included a collaborative annotation capability,&lt;ref name="mosaic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inkdroid.org/tmp/www-talk/1192.html|title=Group Annotation Server Guinea Pigs?|last=Andreessen|first=Marc|date=31 May 1993|accessdate=31 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it was quickly removed.  Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning, [[WebDAV]], was then reintroduced as an extension.

A different approach to distributed authoring consists in first gathering many annotations from a wide public, and then integrate them all in order to produce a further version of a document.  This approach was pioneered by [[Stet (software)|Stet]], the system put in place to gather comments on drafts of version 3 of the [[GNU General Public License]]. This system arose after a specific requirement, which it served egregiously, but was not so easily configurable as to be convenient for annotating any other document on the web. The [[co-ment]] system uses annotation interface concepts similar to Stet's, but it is based on an entirely new implementation, using [[Django (web framework)|Django]]/[[Python (programming language)|Python]] on the server side and various [[AJAX]] libraries such as [[JQuery]] on the client side. Both Stet and co-ment are licensed under the GNU [[Affero General Public License]].

Since 2011, the non-profit Hypothes Is Project &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Corbin|first=Kenneth|title=IRS Determination Letter|url=https://d242fdlp0qlcia.cloudfront.net/uploads/2015/11/03162019/Hypothes.is-501.c3-IRS-Determination-Letter-2013-06-29.pdf|publisher=[[Internal Revenue Service]]|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; has offered the free, open web annotation service [[Hypothes.is]]. The service features annotation via a Chrome extension, bookmarklet or proxy server, as well as integration into a [[Learning management system|LMS]] or [[Content management system|CMS]]. Both [[Web annotation|webpages]] and [[Portable Document Format#Annotation|PDFs]] can be annotated. Other web-based text annotation systems are collaborative software for distributed text editing and versioning, which also feature annotation and commenting interfaces. For example, [http://www.hylighter.com/hybar/site/index.html HyLighter] supports synchronous and asynchronous interactions, general commenting, comment tagging, threaded discussions and comment filtering. Other annotation tools under these category are more focused on [[Natural Language Processing|NLP]] tasks as [[Named-entity recognition]], relationship extraction or [[Canonicalization|normalization]]. Some tools support manual tagging of data or automatic annotations via [[supervised learning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cejuela|first=Juan Miguel|title=tagtog, interactive and text-mining-assisted annotation of gene mentions in PLOS full-text articles|pmc=3978375|publisher=[[Database (journal)|Database: The Journal of Biological Databases and Curation]]|date=7 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specialized Web-based text annotations exist in the context of scientific publication, either for refereeing or post-publication. The on-line journal [[PLoS ONE]], published by the [[Public Library of Science]], has developed its own Web-based system where scientists and the public can comment on published articles. The annotations are displayed as pop-ups with an anchor in the text.

[[File:Historical Thesaurus.jpg|thumb|''Historical Thesaurus of the Oxford English Dictionary'', two-volume set]]
In general usage, a '''thesaurus''' is a [[reference work]] that lists words grouped together according to similarity of meaning (containing [[synonyms]] and sometimes [[antonyms]]), in contrast to a [[dictionary]], which provides [[definitions]] for words, and generally lists them in alphabetical order. The main purpose of such reference works for users "to find the word, or words, by which [an] idea may be most fitly and aptly expressed"&amp;nbsp;– to quote [[Peter Mark Roget]], architect of the best known thesaurus in the English language.&lt;ref name="Roget"&gt;Roget, Peter. 1852. ''Thesaurus of English Language Words and Phrases''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although including synonyms, a thesaurus should not be taken as a complete list of all the synonyms for a particular word. The entries are also designed for drawing distinctions between similar words and assisting in choosing exactly the right word. Unlike a [[dictionary]], a thesaurus entry does not give the definition of words.

In [[library science]] and [[information science]], thesauri have been widely used to specify domain models.  Recently, thesauri have been implemented with [[Simple Knowledge Organization System]] (SKOS).{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

== Etymology ==
The word "thesaurus" is derived from 16th-century [[New Latin]], in turn from [[Latin]] ''[[wikt:en:thesaurus#Latin|thēsaurus]]'', which is the [[Latinisation (literature)|Latinisation]] of the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|[[wikt:en:θησαυρός#Ancient Greek|θησαυρός]]}} (''thēsauros''), "treasure, treasury, storehouse".&lt;ref name="Harper"&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=thesaurus "thesaurus"]. ''[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''thēsauros'' is of uncertain etymology. [[Douglas Harper]] derives it from the root of the Greek verb τιθέναι ''tithenai'', "to put, to place."&lt;ref name="Harper" /&gt; [[Robert S. P. Beekes|Robert Beekes]] rejected an [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European]] derivation and suggested a [[Pre-Greek]] suffix {{nowrap|''*-ar&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;o-''}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]], ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', Brill, 2009, p. 548.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 16th to the 19th centuries, the term "thesaurus" was applied to any [[dictionary]] or [[encyclopedia]], as in the ''[[Thesaurus linguae latinae]]'' (1532), and the ''[[Thesaurus linguae graecae]]'' (1572). The meaning "collection of words arranged according to sense" is first attested in 1852 in Roget's title and ''thesaurer'' is attested in [[Middle English]] for "[[treasurer]]".&lt;ref name="Harper" /&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Roget P M.jpg|150px|right|thumb|[[Peter Mark Roget]], author of the first thesaurus.]]
In antiquity, [[Philo of Byblos]] authored the first text that could now be called a thesaurus. In [[Sanskrit]], the [[Amarakosha]] is a thesaurus in verse form, written in the 4th century. Eventhough Amarakosha mentions 18 prior works, they have all been lost.

The first modern thesaurus was ''[[Roget's Thesaurus]]'', first compiled in 1805 by [[Peter Mark Roget]], and published in 1852. Since its publication it has never been out of print and is still a widely used work across the English-speaking world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199254729.001.0001/acprof-9780199254729-chapter-1|title=Introduction - Oxford Scholarship|author=|date=|website=oxfordscholarship.com|accessdate=26 March 2018|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199254729.001.0001/acprof-9780199254729-chapter-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Entries in ''Roget's Thesaurus'' are listed conceptually rather than alphabetically.
Roget described his thesaurus in the foreword to the first edition:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is now nearly fifty years since I first projected a system of verbal classification similar to that on which the present work is founded. Conceiving that such a compilation might help to supply my own deficiencies, I had, in the year 1805, completed a classed catalogue of words on a small scale, but on the same principle, and nearly in the same form, as the Thesaurus now published.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd 1982, p. xix{{Full citation needed|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thesauri have been used to perform automatic [[word-sense disambiguation]]&lt;ref&gt;Yarowsky, David. "[https://aclanthology.info/pdf/C/C92/C92-2070.pdf Word-sense disambiguation using statistical models of Roget's categories trained on large corpora]."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11159">A '''three-letter acronym''' ('''TLA'''), or '''three-letter abbreviation''', is an [[abbreviation]], specifically an [[Acronym|acronym, alphabetism, or initialism]], consisting of three letters. These are usually the initial letters of the words of the phrase abbreviated, and are written in capital letters (upper case); three-letter abbreviations such as ''etc.'' and ''Mrs.'' are not three-letter acronyms, but "TLA" {{em|itself}} is a TLA (an example of an [[Autological word|autological]] abbreviation).

Most three-letter abbreviations are ''initialisms'': all the letters are pronounced as the names of letters, as in ''[[Acolytes Protection Agency|APA]]'' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|eɪ|p|iː|ˈ|eɪ}} {{respell|AY|pee|AY|'}}. Some are acronyms pronounced as a word; [[computed axial tomography]], CAT, is almost always pronounced as the animal's name in "CAT scan".

==History and origins==

The exact phrase ''three-letter acronym'' appeared in the sociology literature in 1975.&lt;ref name=Levy&gt;{{cite journal |first=M. J. |last=Levy |title=Review of ''The Logic of Social Systems'' |journal=[[American Journal of Sociology]] |volume=81 |issue=3 |year=1975 |jstor=2777655 |doi=10.1086/226119 |page=658 |quote=The acronyms DSE and DNA have something in common: each is a three-letter acronym.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three-letter acronyms were used as [[mnemonic]]s in biological sciences, from 1977&lt;ref name=Seavey&gt;{{cite journal |first=S. R. |last=Seavey |first2=P. H. |last2=Raven |year=1977 |title=Chromosomal Differentiation and the Sources of the South American Species of ''Epilobium'' (Onagraceae) |journal=Journal of Biogeography |volume=4 |issue=1 |page=57 | doi = 10.2307/3038128 |jstor=3038128 |quote=All taxa indicated by three-letter acronyms with strains indicated by a fourth letter if necessary.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their practical advantage was promoted by Weber in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=W. A. |last=Weber |year=1982 |title=Mnemonic Three-Letter Acronyms for the Families of Vascular Plants: A Device for More Effective Herbarium Curation |journal=Taxon |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=74–88 |jstor=1220592 |doi=10.2307/1220592}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are used in many other fields, but the term TLA is particularly associated with computing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=K. D. |last=Nilsen |first2=A. P. |last2=Nilsen |year=1995 |title=Literary Metaphors and Other Linguistic Innovations in Computer Language |journal=The English Journal |volume=84 |issue=6 |pages=65–71 |jstor=820897 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1980, the manual for the Sinclair [[ZX81]] home computer used and explained TLA.&lt;ref name=ZX81&gt;[[Steve Vickers (academia)|Steven Vickers]] ''ZX81 Basic Programming'', Sinclair Research Limited, page 161 "As you can see, everything has a three letter abbreviation (TLA)."&lt;/ref&gt; The specific generation of three-letter acronyms in computing was mentioned in a [[JPL]] report of 1982.&lt;ref name=JPL&gt;[http://tmo.jpl.nasa.gov/progress_report/42-70/70R.PDF TDA Progress Report] R. Hull (1982) An Introduction to the new Productivity Information Management System page 176&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, in a paper titled "On the cruelty of really teaching computer science", eminent computer scientist [[Edsger W. Dijkstra]] wrote &lt;!-- disparagingly (see quote in context) --&gt;
"Because no endeavour is respectable these days without a TLA  ..."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/transcriptions/EWD10xx/EWD1036.html On the cruelty of really teaching computer science]&lt;/ref&gt; By 1992 it was in a [[Microsoft]] handbook.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Gookin (1992) ''The Microsoft Guide to Optimizing Windows'' page 211&lt;/ref&gt;

==Combinatorics==

The number of possible three-letter abbreviations (or [[permutations]]) using the 26 letters of the alphabet from A to Z (AAA, AAB ... to ZZY, ZZZ) is 26 × 26 × 26 = 17,576. Another 26 × 26 × 10 = 6760 can be produced if the third element is allowed to be a digit 0-9, giving a total of 24,336.

In [[English language|English]], [[WWW (disambiguation)|WWW]] is the longest possible TLA to [[Pronunciation of "www"|pronounce]], typically requiring nine [[syllable]]s. The usefulness of TLAs typically comes from how it is quicker to say the [[acronym]] instead of than the phrase they represent, however saying 'WWW' in English requires three times as many syllables than the phrase it is meant to abbreviate (World Wide Web). Consequently, "www" is sometimes abbreviated as "dubdubdub" in speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bulletin.brynmawr.edu/features/digispeak-a-glossary-of-the-new-lingo/|title=DigiSpeak: A Glossary of the New Lingo|date=May 2011|website=bryn mawr alumnae bulletin|publisher=Bryn Mawr College Alumnae Association|accessdate=August 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3901">'''William Chaffers''' (28 September 1811 – 12 April 1892) was an English antiquary and writer of reference works on [[hallmark]]s, and marks on [[ceramics]]. His ''Marks and Monograms on Pottery and Porcelain'', first published in 1863, has appeared in many later editions.

==Life==
Chaffers was the son of William Chaffers and wife Sarah, and was born in Watling Street, London, in 1811; he was descended from a brother of [[Richard Chaffers]] (1731–1765), a manufacturer of [[Liverpool porcelain]]. He was educated at Margate and at [[Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood|Merchant Taylors' School]], where he was entered in 1824.&lt;ref name=dnbsupp&gt;{{cite DNBSupp|first=Thomas|last=Seccombe|authorlink=Thomas Seccombe|wstitle=Chaffers, William|volume=1|page=409}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=odnb&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=5016|title=Chaffers, William}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was attracted to antiquarian studies while a clerk in the city of London, by the discovery of Roman and medieval antiquities in the foundations of the [[Royal Exchange, London|Royal Exchange]] during 1838–9. At the same time he began to concentrate attention upon the study of gold and silver plate and ceramics, especially in regard to the official and other marks by which dates and places of fabrication can be distinguished. In 1863 Chaffers published two important works:&lt;ref name=dnbsupp/&gt;
* ''Hall Marks on Gold and Silver Plate, illustrated, with Tables of Annual Date Letters employed in the Assay Offices of the United Kingdom''; in the 8th edition of 1896 it included "Histories of the Goldsmiths' Trade, both in England and France, and revised London and Provincial Tables", and an introductory essay by C. A. Markham.&lt;ref name=dnbsupp/&gt;
* ''Marks and Monograms on Pottery and Porcelain of the Renaissance and Modern Periods, with Historical Notices of each Manufactory, preceded by an introductory Essay on Vasa Fictilia of the Greek, Romano-British, and Mediæval Eras''. The aim of the work was to be for ceramics what {{ill|Franz Brulliot|de}}'s ''Dictionnaire des Monogrammes'' was to painting, and it at once established Chaffers as the leading authority upon his subject.&lt;ref name=dnbsupp/&gt; Many subsequent editions have appeared, revised by later editors; the 9th edition appeared in 1900, and the 15th edition in 1965.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

Other publications are ''The Keramic Gallery'', in 2 volumes, with 500 illustrations (1872); a handbook abridged from ''Marks and Monograms'' (1874); ''Gilda Aurifabrorum'', a history of goldsmiths and plate workers and their marks (1883); also a priced catalogue of coins, and other minor catalogues.&lt;ref name=dnbsupp/&gt;&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

His reputation was furthered in organizing exhibitions of art treasures, at [[Art Treasures Exhibition, Manchester 1857|Manchester in 1857]], [[1862 International Exhibition|South Kensington in 1862]], Leeds in 1869, Dublin in 1872, Wrexham in 1876, and Hanley (at the great Staffordshire exhibition of ceramics) in 1890. Chaffers was elected [[Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London]] in 1843, and he was a frequent contributor to ''Archæologia'', to ''[[Notes and Queries]]'', and to various learned periodicals upon the two subjects of which he had particular knowledge.&lt;ref name=dnbsupp/&gt;

In 1841 he married Charlotte Matilda, daughter of John Hewett.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; About 1870 he retired from [[Fitzroy Square]] to a house in Willesden Lane, and later moved to [[West Hampstead]], where he died on 12 April 1892.&lt;ref name=dnbsupp/&gt;

'''Xmas''' is a common [[abbreviation]] of the word ''[[Christmas]]''. It is sometimes pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛ|k|s|m|ə|s}}, but ''Xmas'', and variants such as ''Xtemass'', originated as handwriting abbreviations for the typical pronunciation {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|r|ɪ|s|m|ə|s}}. The "X" comes from the [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] letter ''[[Chi (letter)|Chi]]'', which is the first letter of the Greek word ''Χριστός'', which in English is "[[Christ]]".&lt;ref name=oed-x&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title= X n. 10. |encyclopedia= [[Oxford English Dictionary]] |publisher= [[Oxford University Press]] |url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/230945#eid14045485 |year= 2011|accessdate= 17 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The "-mas" part is from the Latin-derived [[Old English]] word for ''[[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09790b.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: Liturgy of the Mass]. Retrieved 20 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The abbreviation of Christmas as "Xmas" is the source of disagreement among Christians who observe the holiday. 

The December 1957 ''News and Views'' published by the [[Church League of America]], a conservative organization co-founded in 1937 by George Washington Robnett,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://libweb.uoregon.edu/speccoll/guides/conservative.html |title= Subject Guide to Conservative and Libertarian Materials, in Manuscript Collections |publisher= University of Oregon}}&lt;/ref&gt; attacked the use of Xmas in an article titled "X=The Unknown Quantity". The claims were picked up later by [[Gerald L. K. Smith]], who in December 1966 claimed that Xmas was a "blasphemous omission of the name of Christ" and that "'X' is referred to as being symbolical of the unknown quantity."  Smith further argued that Jews introduced Santa Claus to suppress the New Testament accounts of Jesus, and that the United Nations, at the behest of "world Jewry", had "outlawed the name of Christ".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-link= Morris Kominsky |last= Kominsky |first= Morris |year= 1970 |title= The Hoaxers: Plain Liars, Fancy Liars and Damned Liars |pages= 137–138 |isbn= 0-8283-1288-5}}{{full citation needed|date=December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is, however, a well documented history of use of ''Χ'' (actually a [[Chi (letter)|chi]]) as an abbreviation for "Christ" (Χριστός) and possibly also a symbol of the cross.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ancient-symbols.com/christian_symbols.html |title= Christian Symbols and Their Descriptions |publisher= Ancient-symbols.com |date= |accessdate= 8 December 2008}}{{unreliable source?|date= December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://tlc.howstuffworks.com/family/xmas.htm |publisher= tlc.howstuffworks.com |title= Why Is There a Controversy Surrounding the Word 'Xmas'? |accessdate= 25 December 2012}}{{unreliable source?|date= December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The abbreviation appears on many Orthodox Christian religious icons.

Dennis Bratcher, writing for a website for Christians, states "there are always those who loudly decry the use of the abbreviation 'Xmas' as some kind of blasphemy against Christ and Christianity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crivoice.org/symbols/xmasorigin.html |title=The Origin of "Xmas" |publisher=CRI/Voice |date=2007-12-03 |accessdate=2009-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among them are evangelist [[Franklin Graham]] and [[CNN]] journalist [[Roland S. Martin]]. Graham stated in an interview: &lt;blockquote&gt;"for us as Christians, this is one of the most holy of the holidays, the birth of our savior Jesus Christ. And for people to take Christ out of Christmas. They're happy to say merry Xmas. Let's just take Jesus out.

Retrieved on December 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Bratcher posits that those who dislike abbreviating the word are unfamiliar with a long history of Christians using X in place of "Christ" for various purposes.

The word "[[Christ]]" and its compounds, including "Christmas", have been abbreviated in English for at least the past 1,000 years, long before the modern "Xmas" was commonly used. "Christ" was often written as "Xρ" or "Xt"; there are references in the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' as far back as 1021. This X and P arose as the [[uppercase]] forms of the [[Greek alphabet|Greek letters]] [[Chi (letter)|χ]] (Ch) and [[rho|ρ]] (R) used in ancient abbreviations for Χριστος (Greek for "Christ").&lt;ref name=oed-x/&gt; The [[labarum]], an amalgamation of the two Greek letters rendered as ☧,&lt;ref group=note&gt;[[Unicode]] character Chi Rho (U+2627)&lt;/ref&gt; is a symbol often used to represent Christ in [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], [[Protestant]], and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] Christian Churches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://christiansymbols.net/monograms_2.php Christian Symbols: Chi-Rho] ''Christian Symbols'', Doug Gray, Retrieved 2009-12-07&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (''OED'') and the ''OED Supplement'' have cited usages of "X-" or "Xp-" for "Christ-" as early as 1485. The terms "Xtian" and less commonly "Xpian" have also been used for "Christian". The ''OED'' further cites usage of "Xtianity" for "Christianity" from 1634.&lt;ref name=oed-x/&gt; According to ''Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of English Usage'', most of the evidence for these words comes from "educated Englishmen who knew their Greek".&lt;ref name=mwdeu&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2yJusP0vrdgC&amp;pg=PA968&amp;dq=Xmas+usage&amp;ei=zVZWSa6FJY6syASeyKHRAw "Xmas" article], ''Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of English Usage'', Merriam-Webster, 1994, p 968, {{ISBN|978-0-87779-132-4}}, retrieved via Google Books, December 27, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other uses of "X(t)" for "Chris(t)-"====
Other proper names containing the name "Christ" besides those mentioned above are sometimes abbreviated similarly, either as "X" or "Xt", both of which have been used historically,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.all-acronyms.com/XT./Christ/1136835 "Abbreviation: Xt." Date retrieved: 19 Dec. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; e.g., "Xtopher" or "Xopher" for "Christopher", or "Xtina" or "Xina" for the name "Christina".

In the 17th and 18th centuries, "Xene" and "Exene" were common spellings for the given name Christine. The American singer [[Christina Aguilera]] has sometimes gone by the name "Xtina". Similarly, [[Exene Cervenka]] has been a noted American singer-songwriter since 1977.

This usage of "X" to spell the syllable "kris" (rather than the sounds "ks") has extended to "xtal" for "[[crystal]]", and on [[florist]]s' signs to "xant" for "[[chrysanthemum]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=13693&amp;lastnode_id=0 |title=X |publisher=Everything 2 |date= |accessdate=2009-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; even though these words are not etymologically related to "Christ": "crystal" comes from a Greek word meaning "ice" (and not even using the letter χ), and "chrysanthemum" comes from Greek words meaning "golden flower", while "Christ" comes from a Greek word meaning "anointed".

==In popular culture==
In the animated television series ''[[Futurama]]'', which is set in the 31st century, Xmas {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛ|k|s|m|ə|s}} is the official name for the day formerly known as Christmas (which, in the episode "[[Xmas Story]]", is said to have become an "archaic pronunciation").

In the American version of the board game ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]'', players can draw a card from the [[Chance and Community Chest cards|Community Chest]] which reads: "Xmas fund matures. Collect $100".
